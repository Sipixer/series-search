in Long Island sound. He left me his biggest client, the Darlings-- Tripp, the empire builder... You're gonna have to start trusting me sometime. Letitia, the sophisticated socialite... Your father was my great love. Brian, the man of God... I lied to my wife and daughters last night. I told them that you were an orphan. I want you and that boy out of this house until I figure out what to do. Patrick, the principled politician... You have to get your house in order. Karen, the professional divorcee... Using the chapel for your fourth marriage would just be insulting to the rest of the marrying public. Karen, do not call me on the home phone number. I'll always love you, too. And Jeremy and Juliet, the well-behaved twins. Oh, my god! I've been thinking lately, and I should get a job, right? My father was working for someone else. You should come work for me, finish what your father started. You getting anything out of that better Manhattan conference so far, Nick? Oh, it's interesting-- bunch of billionaires talking about how much real estate they own in the city. Yeah. Well, it's pretty small potatoes, really. The reason people come here is for the game. The game? The game-- a high stakes poker game. It's been going on for about 40 years. $20 million just to get in. Simon Elder's gonna be there this year. First time. Well, I guess now's the time to take this baby to the next level. - Really? - Yeah, and from what I heard, it was Dutch got him invited into the game. Would've been one of the last things your dad did. I guess Mr. Elder didn't bring that up when he had dinner with you, did he? No, he never mentioned it. He had time to accuse me of murdering my best friend, but he didn't get around to telling you what he and my best friend were actually up to. - I think it was more than poker. - I do, too. Well, the game is not for another two days. So let us get back to the party. - Hi, Nick. - Hey, Karen. Hello. - Thank you for not avoiding me. - I haven't been avoiding you. Oh, don't fib. You've been a little distant since Italy. - Well, it hasn't been intentional. - Mm. Okay. Ahem. Hey, baby. - Hi. - Freddy. So... did you ask about the thing? Oh, right. Yes. We need a favor. Freddy and I have been so overwhelmed with wedding planning that we... we need you to go down to city hall and get our marriage license. You know, do some of that lawyer magic? You have to sign the license in person, Karen. - They haven't changed that law yet. - Nope, not yet. Huh. Not even for regular customers? Seems like there ought to be some sort of reward or fringe benefit or something, right? Sorry. You want a cupcake? I already had three at Magnolia with Juliet. - But okay. - That where you two were? Yeah. She talked about Natalie Kimpton for hours. - What a slut. - Hey, don't use that word. What time you want me at your office tomorrow? - 6:00? 5:00? - 9:00's fine. Ah, banker's hours. Okay. - Are you ready for this? - Ready? I am drooling. I'm gonna be a member of the working class. - I'm gonna make dad proud. - See you then. When Patrick was introduced to Gerald Ford... Just before he took over the presidency. He had some words of advice for the man. I love this story. Patrick. Tell Larry what you said to Jerry Ford. Oh, you tell him, dad. That was your proud moment, not mine. He said, "restore dignity to the White House, sir." He was 8 years old. Dignity. Yowza! Oh! Oh. That... was a gold medal performance. Thanks. What's the matter, baby? Sometimes, it... sometimes it's just kind of depressing. The only thing intimate that ever takes place between us happens in hotel rooms and limousines, never in public. Doing what we just did in public is illegal in most states. I hate being a secret. I know. Hey, you want to go back to Vermont? We can, uh, you know, take a weekend. Going to Vermont is just another giant secret. - I'm married and running for senate. - I can't help how I feel, Pat. We've never even stood in the street and kissed. Just kissed. - See? - See? This isn't so bad. Did you ever think maybe this is why I don't want to do it? Hmm? Because it's hard to feel free with you and then not want to feel that way all the time. God. You are gonna be president some day. - Oh, yeah? - You always know just what to say. Hey, Patrick! Take a look over here, sweetie. - Whoa! Get down! - Yeah! Oh, yeah. - Thanks a lot, sucker! shut up! - Get over here! What are you gonna do, Nick? That photo gets out, dad's gonna crucify me. Well, with all due respect, Pat, you should've thought about that before making a spectacle. She's tired of being a secret, okay? Then she should go out with somebody who isn't married, who isn't running for the senate and who isn't a Darling. That doesn't make it right for people to stalk their fellow human beings with cameras. I mean, if everything everybody did was captured on film, none of us would look like very good people, right? Look, Pat, I'm sure some creep is gonna try and sell us the negatives or the memory card for a million dollars any day now. - Any day is too late. - Detective Larrabee on two. Okay. Look, we're just gonna have to sit back and wait. Hang on a second. Hello. I'm just calling to let you know that the NTSB report on your dad's plane crash came in today. - What did it say? - That's the police? It's clean. No evidence of foul play, no tampering whatsoever. - Run-of-the-mill engine failure. - Okay. - Is it about the photos? - No. I don't know what to say, Mr. George. I'm sorry your father's gone. I know how badly you wanted to hold someone responsible for this horrible accident, but... that's just what it was, an accident. And accidents happen. Yeah. Yeah, they do. Thank you. You want some coffee? No. - A bagel? A bear claw? - I'm okay. Thank you. - Anything? - No. I just... I guess I'm trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do... now that I don't have to find out who killed my dad. Maybe you should just... start missing him? Sorry I'm late. It's 9:00 somewhere, dude. Time for work. Okay, Darling luxury hotels. Your family owns 23 properties in the U.S. And 32 throughout Europe and Asia. Hotel rooms are only good for one thing, Nick-- smells like trouble. Darling live-- four sports stadiums, three arenas and nine concert venues. Nah, it would kill me to be that close to the limelight and not be a part of it. I'm sorry. Pass. Darling farms-- the largest organic produce company in the United States. I like the crazy boots, but, uh, come on, dude. Cows? They're scary. Darling pharmaceuticals. Let's skip this one. Darling developments-- 23 office towers, 62 apartment buildings, 10,000 residents. Can I be, like, the janitor or something, like the fix it guy? Well, what exactly can you fix? Okay, that's a good point. Jeremy, I'll tell you what, why don't we start with what you're good at? Well, I've always had this uncanny ability to just chill. You know, like I could be sitting in a chair and it's 2:00. Next thing I know-- boom! 4:00. So zoning out, that's your special skill? I can drive a car. - That's not a special skill. - Oh, it is the way I drive. Oh, god, I always forget how long this takes. Bureaucracy just another name for mediocrity. Freddy, you're gonna need to stop that. Karen Darling. That's me. Hey, it's you. How nice to see you. Nice to see you again, Ms. Darling. Is this number three, four? Four. But he's number one in my heart. Mwah. Of course he is. - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh? - Is there a problem? - Unfortunately, yes. Polyandry's illegal in New York state. - What'd you just call me? - Freddy, relax. What did-- what-- what did you just call him? Ms. Darling, you're still married. - To whom? - Your last husband. Sebastian fleet. No, we were divorced, like, three-- three years ago. He never signed the papers. You're gonna need to take care of this. - Paul Cotley. - Baby! No. Clark, tell Patrick the drive-through window is closed. Ma'am, if you could just get in the car, please. It's important. So what do you want? - Here. - What are these? Pictures. You hired that photographer. I've tried and tried to make it clear to Patrick just how much he stands to lose by maintaining this alliance, but to no avail. None. So I find myself compelled to rely upon your good judgment and the support of this... sadly necessary object lesson. How long do you think it would be before Paddy's opponents sent someone after the two of you to document this embarrassment? How long, honestly, do you think this can endure? I've thought the same thing. There's a cashier's check in this envelope... for considerably more money than you will require to relocate anywhere. And believe me, no one knows better than I do that money is cold comfort in the absence of love. So it is with the... utmost compassion... and goodwill that I appeal to whatever genuine feelings you have for my son, and implore you to... let him go. This liaison is impossible. - Mr. Darling... Tripp? - Tripp. I am a living, breathing testament to the fact that nothing-- and I mean nothing-- is impossible. I'm gonna do you the favor of not telling Patrick we had this conversation because he would be terribly hurt. And that's the last thing I want. I see where Patrick gets his good looks. - So I'd manage the whole structure? - No, you'd be working here... Parking cars. Right. We start at the bottom, common-man style. I forgot about that. And you'll be working for this man. Lou Mack, I want you to meet Jeremy Darling. - Hello, Lou. I recognize you. - I was your doorman for eight years. Yeah, you were. I didn't recognize you without the, uh, epaulets. Lou is my boss. I love it. Full circle. Does everyone get a clipboard? - Nick George. - Nick, it's Simon Elder. You know, your dad got me into this crazy poker game tomorrow. Yeah, Tripp told me. Personally, I think this whole thing's distasteful-- bunch of puffed-up peacocks gambling away people's homes and offices as if life were no more than... - A card game? - Yeah, right. But sometimes, a little distasteful behavior is necessary. Your point being? Well, there's a reason Dutch made this happen for me. We had a plan. You know, when Robert Moses redesigned new york city for the automobile, a lot of good came from his work. - And a lot of bad. - Yeah, I agree. He made this whole city much more unlivable. I envision a new Manhattan-- cleaner air, better public transportation, and your dad... your dad was gonna help make my vision a reality. I see. - So what do you want from me? - At some point, the stakes for the game tomorrow will get so high that cash will no longer be enough. Real estate will become the necurrency. And what I want from you is very simple. Convince Tripp to throw Darling Plaza into the pot. What part does an 80-year-old, 15-story building play in the revitalization of New York city? Don't you worry about that, Nick. You just get that piece of land in the pot, and I will win that hand. What do you say? I don't think so. I'm not sure Tripp would go for it, and frankly, I don't know if you're telling me the truth. - About? - About my father. That's fair. That's fair. I heard you got the clean NTSB report on your dad's plane crash. You should know, that report was doctored long before the police ever got it. Really? - It's a fake. - A fake? Now if you really want to find out who killed your dad, you do this for me. And... I'll get the real report for you. - Just think about it. - Okay? Okay? All right, Tobey looked at me, he's freaking out. I said, "man, you have no choice. You have to be Spidey." I taught him this action. The rest is movie history. I got this one. Gracias. Hey, Jules. You would not believe the girl whose car I'm parking. - Be careful. - No need. I'm a vehicular ninja. I'm talking about your heart. You are on the rebound. I'm just parking her car. Oh, do you know where your binoculars are? Little Brian needs them for polo. Jeremy? Jeremy? Nick, I need you to come with me. Karen if I go with you, then your ex is gonna want to have his lawyer come with him-- Never bring a lawyer if you don't have to. Exactly. Just go get divorced. No, but, Nick, I can't face him alone. You know Sebastian. - No, Karen, I don't. - Hey, Daisy, where are the rest of the real estate files? Which ones, Darling Plaza, Darling financial center, the hotels? All of them. I need all of them. - All right, so Sebastian... - Yes, Sebastian Fleet. - World-renowned anthropologist? - "People's" sexiest man alive? In the anthropology category, yes. - He's got a pretty incredible heinie. - I know. - Thank you for that, Daisy. - He's got a hold on me, Nick. It's magnetic. It's electric. It's sexual. - I get it, Karen. - I will eat him alive! - You're getting married in three months. - I know. So exercise a little self-control. What if I can't? What if I cheat on Freddy, and he-- oh, god-- and he dumps me? Well, that sex tape you made with his caddie didn't seem to faze him. Oh, I know, but Sebastian and I, we were married. - He activates my yoni-- - Karen, I'm not comin'. Fine. Okay. Yeah, don't. But... letting me risk ruining my marriage to Freddy, sure makes it seem like you want me free for you... and that's selfish. Thanks, Nick. If Nick doesn't find these pictures, I'm screwed. Come on, Nick, Nick, Nick. - Nick's not answering. - Patrick, you need to relax. Oh, relax? This story could break any second. My whole life could go up in flames. You want me to relax? - The story's not gonna break. - How could you be so sure? - Are you insane? - I want what's best for you. Oh, so you want to buy off the woman that I love behind my back? You do not know yourself well enough to manage-- I don't need to know myself, dad. I know you. When are you gonna get it through your thick skull that you can't control me anymore? Patrick, when your uncle Kenneth was taken from us, your destiny was sealed. It is my deepest, most heartfelt belief... that a moment is coming in history when you, Patrick, you will play an important role in the unfolding mystery of human freedom. That's what politics is. That's what you need to be a part of, freedom, not license. And you should know that she promised me that she would not tell you about this. - I'm glad that she did. - No, Patrick, you don't understand. She lied to me. She lies. She can't be trusted. She-- you're the one that's not to be trusted! You know what? We're done! - Patrick-- - You're sick, dad. You are unwell. I am tired of it all-- the money, the advice, the support, all of it. We are done. I mean it. - What do you guys think? - Ooh. I think you're screwed, man. Man. I knew I shoulda learned how to fix stuff! Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, don't worry, man. Hey, hey. Don't worry, man. Hey, at least they can't fire you, right? I got it. Hey, Jeremy, where you goin', dude? I know how to fix it! Sorry about the wait. I just wanted to get it washed for you-- - Aw, that's so sweet. - No tip. Maybe next time. How'd you get it fixed in 30 minutes? I bought her a new car and changed the plates. When's lunch break? - No. No. - Ok. This one? No, no. I hate that. Oh, Nick. Could I have a word with you? - Scarlet? - No, no, I like red, but we're not doing a monsoon wedding. I need you to keep an eye on Tripp at the all-important game. Okay. He gets very competitive with that crowd. He'd never admit it, but he does. If someone puts him up to a dare, he'll take it. He will not walk away from a bet. So I need you to make sure that he-- well, he doesn't make a fool of himself. Has he done that before? - See this finger? - Yes. Upon this finger, do you see the most valuable emerald in the world? He lost it last year at the game. - I'll keep an eye on him. - Merci. - You got the deeds? - Right here. It's gonna be a real good game. What'd you round up for me to bet with? Foundry's bringing half of Harlem. Mostly just what you talked about-- the building on fifth and a few smaller hotels, Darling Plaza. Listen now, Tripp, I know that since we're-- Hang on, hang on. Darling Plaza? No. No, no, no. Darling Plaza was our first home in Manhattan. It was a gift. Letitia's father gave it to me. Patrick and Karen were born there. I wouldn't sell it let alone risk it on a game of cards. Tripp, the fact that it's that important to you could be useful... - as a bluff. - Nick, what's going on? I said Darling Plaza is off the table. It's off the table. I don't understand. What's got into you? - Karen? - Sebastian. - You were showering? - No. Okay. Can you sign these, please? They put these sweet little stickies on here so you'd know just where to put your john hanc-hancock. You look beautiful, as always. Sign please. Just-- just sign these. I'm not sure what went wrong here, Karen. I signed those the first time around. - You did? - Mm-hmm. I gave 'em to that, what, the guy from the Netherlands? - Netherlands? - Oh, you mean Dutch? You signed them and you gave them to Dutch? Yeah, yeah, that guy. No problem. I'll sign 'em again. Want to come in, have a drink? I'm brewing a little cocoa tea from Peru. It's quite relaxing. Mnh-mnh. See, I see what you're doing here. I'm not doing anything, Karen, besides asking my wife to come in and make herself comfortable. Come in. Have some tea. - Oh, you lost your towel. - No, it tastes better naked. I remember. - Simon. - I guess I'm late. Simon Elder. Nice to see you again. Hey, I've been meaning to tell you how sorry I am. - Sorry? - About Dutch. But you're lucky 'cause you got this guy on your team. Well, you're right there. I am lucky. I am extremely lucky. You ready to play some cards? Absolutely. Oh, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Um, I guess, uh, I should sign these now, huh? Hey. Oh, you're finally marrying Nick George, huh? Yeah, Nick. Wait. No. No. No, no, no, no. Um, not Nick. What are you talking about? His name's all over this thing. Yeah, because Nick's my lawyer. I'm marrying Freddy. - He's a golfer. - Oh. So you're gonna do it all over again to somebody else? Do what? Nothing. You just be happy. Sebastian... we were happy. Why didn't it work out with us? Come on. I was never around. I was always out somewhere eating psychogenic plants or doing ritual circumcisions. Mm. Right. That's right. Even when I was here... I was never Nick. That was part of it. There you go. It was nice being married to you. And it was nice being married to you, too, Karen. It really was. Oh, come on. What are you turkeys doing in my room? Get out. Dude, this is my game. Little squirt jr. Must have brought it in here. Have you seen him? He was supposed to be back with Juliet an hour ago. - Ooh. - Crash. The great kazoo here wrecked a car his first day on the job-- Hey! It's all good. I replaced it. She didn't even notice. Well, aren't you bothered at all? Doesn't your conscience feel the tiniest prick? Not until you walked in, Bri, and I'm still not really feeling it. Oh! Victorious! - Oh, damn it! - Damn it! - Oh, you want some punishment? - Dream on. Come on, Brian. Everybody in this family gets away with everything but me. Oh, yeah? Do you see these calluses? They're from gripping steering wheels all day. Please. I'm running for senate, and my whole life's being run like a puppet show by dad. You see, you see? Nobody gets away with anything around here. Your crap just finally caught up with you. - Bonjour. - Where's juliet? She dropped me off. Pay dirt. Suck it! Yeah! - Still the king. - Give it, baby. Give it. Whoa. Oh! - I'm gonna miss this place. - What, when you go to Washington? Yeah. When I go to Washington. Raise. I'm not feeling self-destructive. $80 million to you, sir. Well, I guess now's the time to take this baby to the next level, right? Woodmere Plaza-- two connected retail buildings on Broadway. Appraised last week at $101 million. Darling financial center. - How about Darling Plaza? - We discussed this, Nick. There's no reason to bet the farm, Tripp. - You're out of line, Nick. - Maybe, but I can't advise staking your most profitable building. I told you not even to bring the damn deed to the boat. Tripp, don't confuse sentimentality with business. Darling Plaza hasn't made money in years. Il ne pas confondre avec le prix est la valeur du chose. - Don't confuse the price with the value-- - With the value of the thing. I got it. Now look, the building is paralyzed by rent control until 2010. It needs over $10 million worth of structural improvements. How many times do I have to explain this to you? - Would you just trust me, Tripp? - Nick-- Trust me. Just trust me. Well, come on, Darling. Pony up. Look, all you have to do is win the hand, and you won't lose anything. Unless you don't think you can win. Darling Plaza. Sorry I'm late. - Where have you been? - Oh, getting my divorce. - And how is Sebastian? - Fine. Same as ever. Perfect. - Would you excuse us, please? - Absolutely. - Tell me you didn't. - I didn't. - I didn't! - Oh, you are unbelievable. He wasn't going to sign otherwise. I had to. How do you expect to make a fresh start with Freddy if you're still sleeping with your ex-husband? He wasn't my ex-husband at the actual time of the coupling. We were technically still married. - Karen, your behavior-- - Is what it is. Fine. I wouldn't have had to go over there and behave at all if it wasn't for you. - And what does that mean? - Dutch never filed the papers. - And how is that my fault? - Well, I'm sure when he was supposed to be filing them, he was in some hotel doing to you what Sebastian just did to me. - Don't be disgusting. - I'm not the one who's disgusting. Look, I know what you think of me, but don't you think it kills me to see you making the same mistakes I did? - What mistakes? - Putting three people in your marriage. - Mother, I divorced Sebastian. - I'm not talking about Sebastian. I'm talking about Nick. I call. Wilkes housing project. The pot now contains over $400 million in cash and property. No more bets so we stay under $500 million as agreed. River card. Gentlemen. Straight. Flush, all hearts. Mr. Elder wins the hand. - Wow. Well done. - To you. To you. - Tripp, I'm sorry. - You're sorry? - I don't know what else to say. - You can say to my wife that I've lost the building that we spent the first seven years of our marriage in. No, in fact, I'll say it to her. I don't want to see you for a few days. I'm telling you, Bridget, Katie's so-- ow! - Bye, Bridget. - Hello? - Did you buy my son a $30,000 watch? - It was 15% off. - Are you out of your mind? - No. You're spoiling him rotten! All he does is walk around now and mouth off and ask for expensive things. You've turned a nice, fake swedish orphan into your own personal living doll. And a watch? He can't even tell time. He asked for it, you jerk. He only wanted a Patek Philipp because that's what you wear. I'm just trying to make him feel like part of the family. I love hanging out with him, but you're the one he's always talking about. - I don't have time for this. - Pfft. You don't have time for him. Well, look who's back in her brand-new ride. Oh, this is a sign. Hello. Welcome back. Gracias. Uh, can I, um, talk to you for a second? - Sure. - Okay. I'm just gonna come right out and say this. - This isn't your car. - Okay. I just drove it from home. Oh, I know, but, um, that is-- that is your car. - Then whose car is this? - This is a rental. Um... Yeah, I was gonna switch it after I got the other one fixed. But, you know, it felt wrong to do-- in the interest of full disclosure-- 'cause I'm in this phase in my life where I'm kind of seeking consequences and-- do you wanna talk to my boss? No, it's okay. You told the truth. That's enough... As long as you fix my car today. - No problem. Thank you. -  Okay. Uh, can I, uh, buy you dinner sometime? - That's sweet. - But you're not my type. Sorry. Why did you say you rented it? Why didn't you just tell her you bought the car? I didn't want her to know. Know what, that you're Jeremy Darling? That's the ultimate closer, man. Yeah, I know. I thought I told you to keep an eye on my husband. - Things got a little out of hand. - A little? You let him gamble away the one building of ours that actually meant something to me. Your father never would've done that. Well, Letitia, I'm not my father. And that's, you know, a good thing. He was far from perfect. I know that, but he protected me. He protected all of us from... Tripp's whims. It was a comfort, and I miss it. That's all. - I'm sorry. - No, no, it-- you're right to push back. You know... your father and I... it's funny, we always felt that-- that we were sacrificing so much. But I guess everybody was, knowingly or unknowingly. We were all having something stolen from us. You know, I really don't know who's in control anymore, or what. For Tripp to have gambled away that building... Well, mustn't mean as much to him as it once did. And that's not your fault, it's mine. I came as soon as I could. Hope I didn't keep you waiting. - You're gonna miss this place. - I am, actually... a little bit. I shouldn't, you know? Sitting Bull said, "the love of possession is a disease with them," with us. And it is, he was right. So I try to see that my ownership of land and property is... part of a larger creative project. And I have tried not to be... attached. It's done. How's Jeremy doing? Good. He's working for Darling parking. You know why I asked you to walk him around the company, don't you? - I assumed to get him a job. - No. I wanted you to see all the aspects of the company that you are going to run one day. No, it's not anything we have to talk about right now. I just... wanted you to know that that's what my wish is. So... when are you gonna meet with Simon Elder and get that NTSB report? Tonight. Tonight? Oh. Thank you, Tripp. For letting this place go. Darling Plaza was our first home in Manhattan. I wouldn't sell it let alone risk it on a game of cards. But, Tripp, the fact that it's so important to you could be useful... - as bluff. - Nick, what's going on? I said Darling Plaza is off the table. It's off the table. I don't understand. What's got into you? Simon Elder told me that if I could get this property in the game, that he would get me the real NTSB report on dad's plane. He said the original one had been doctored. - And you believe him? - I do. - I'm not sure why, but I do. - Why-- why Darling Plaza? You know, he didn't really say. Just that it's part of some plan. How do we know that he isn't somehow the one responsible for doctoring the NTSB report? How do we know he wasn't implicated in the crash? He may be, but if I can get him to trust me, I'll have a way in. And having someone with inside access to Simon Elder would not be bad for Darling enterprises, especially if he thinks that you and I are at odds with one another. You and me, at odds? - Okay. - You in? Let's do it. I love you, Nicky. And I want to find out who killed Dutch just as much as you do, maybe more. And I told you I would do everything it took. - There you go. - Thanks, Athen. Oh, and can I have some vanilla ice cream? Okay. Things are gonna be changing around here, buddy. Like what? Like less time with aunt Juliet, more time with me. - Really? - Yeah, but don't look so happy about it. No more watches. No more fancy clothes. Just some good old-fashioned father-son time. What happens during good old-fashioned father-son time? I don't know yet. I never had any. You could teach me backgammon. Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Let me show you something. See... you cut a hole in the center of the stack. Otherwise, you only get syrup on the top pancake. It's a special syrup distribution method I developed in seminary. Oh. - That's cool, huh? - Yeah. Thanks, dad. - We'll start with backgammon tomorrow. - Okay. - Thanks for your help in the poker game. - You're welcome. - Your father would be proud. - I'll take your word for that. So this is what Dutch and I were working on-- a whole new vision for the city. Those glass buildings-- transparent solar panels. - I'm glad you're now a part of it. - Me, too. Well, you didn't come down here just to see my dream for Manhattan. I'd like to see that report, yes. No problem. Hello, Mr. George. - You had the dealer? - There are two reports. The correct NTSB report which states your dad's crash was indeed caused by foul play. And the maintenance report that says only one mechanic worked on the plane. It appears a man named Norman Exley was responsible. You've heard of him? Yeah. And I guess he lied to me. Go to the police, Nick. There's plenty of evidence for them to look into. - Thank you, Simon. - No problem. Thank you. We'll definitely be in touch. Your next appointment is here. Send him in. - Simon, glad we can finally do this. - Been a long time coming. - I'll say. - Please. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Hi. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Where are they going?
