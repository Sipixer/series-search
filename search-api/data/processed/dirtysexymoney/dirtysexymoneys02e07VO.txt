Do you think it's gonna change after we get married? It doesn't have to. When i was 7, i loved bana pudding. I did. I loved it. I ate it every day. And then one morning, i woke up and i looked down and i realized i hated it. Is our sex life gonna be like that bana pudding? I think my bana pudding has more staying power than you are used to. Come here. Come here. Thank you. - For what? - For finding me... And for making me feel so safe. so where are you headed today? I have to go to the imperial. I have,um,a meeting with the caters, you know,final tweaks. Are you sure your father's gonna be okay with us getting married at his home? No,daddy talks a big game and-- Well, and he handles the money-- But when it comes to ceremonies and holidays, he doesn't really have a say. That's mommy's department. It'll be fine. Trust me. This wedding cannot take place. It cannot. Well,it's tomorrow. People are flying in from all over the world. It's all my fault. No,it was karen's idea to spy on simon. I let her do it. I let her wander into that den of inequity. Look,what do you want me to do? We have to find a way out of it. Set up a meeting with simon elder. All right. - And,nick. - Yeah. I find myself enthralled with our young houseguest wrenn. Yeah,you told me the other night. I wonder if you could arrange a - a luncheon for the three of us. Okay. And could you do one other thing? Yeah,what's that? Could you please... Not show up? Uh,w-- do you think that's a good idea? Why,is there something i should know? Tell me,please. - I'll set it up. - Good. Thank you. Manhattan had renewable energy 400 years ago... And we're ready to do it again. So you want me to build my biodiesel plant right here in new york city? For starters. Well,it's a fine idea, senator. And your tax incentives are competitive,ms. Lyons. And there's no way i'm signing with you. May i ask why exactly? Ask your father. He burned me in business deals... Oh,mr. O'nnell-- twice,and he did it in a way a man doesn't forget, In a way that made me want to come here and say no to you personally. Give your dad my best. I'll take care of this. Mr. O'connell. Mr. O'connell. Mis-- What? Not now. Mr. O'connell,please. Sir... Not interested. Sir,tripp darling and patrick darling have nothing to do with one another. I'm telling you, please reconsider... Why are you here? It's my bro's office. N'est pas? He works for the people. Me people. Was thattheevan o'connell? - He's taller in person. - I am not gonna let you cost me another job. - Okay,this has gotta stop. - Or start again. I'd rather eat glass. Get a life. I have a life. Find a better way to spend it. - Hello. - How are you? You look like you're feeling better. I think i'm fine, but tripp keeps saying i can't leave until i'm 100%,so... Nobody suspects that we're meeting for coffee. So don't worry. Well,i'm not-- i'm not worried.I just,uh-- - listen,uh... About the other night. - Yeah. I don't normally kiss guys i just met. just so you know. I hadn't drawn any conclusions. But it was nice. You're very sweet. - He is sweet,isn't he? - Lisa. Uh,you remember wrenn from... Yes,from my battle royale with karen. How could i forget? Sorry to break up the sweetness. You brought her here, to our place? You know what? Um, i can go if you two-- - No. - No. No,stay,please. It's a free country,obviously. I e-mailed you ki's midterm grades. Her teachers says she's a little distracted, But i will let you two get back to your conversation. Lisa... It's nice to know mourning our marriage hasn't gotten in the way of your dating. - Lisa-- - don't.Just don't. Oh,pardon me. Jeremy,it's me. I have auestion, and it's not a question because you don't have a choice. So listen up. Wrenn is not what she appears to be. I- i c-- i can feel it in my bones. - Letia-- - don't you "letitia" me. Your father used to say it just like that. I have a-a gold digger sinking her claws into my marriage. I think that you are being a little dramatic. Dramatic? I heard tripp tell you that girl has him thinking he can do better than me. I heard it. Three friends of mine have lost their husbands to women like this in the last six months. I will not join the ranks of the deserted. I will not die alone. Okay,what do you want me to do? I want you to,i don't... Do some checking, see if she has a criminal record. - In all seriousness? - What? You hit the woman with a car. Initiating a background check on her on the heels of that could start to look like harassment. There's nothing to be done. Oh,well. Merci beaucoup. Oh,oh,and just,um, so you know,nick, jeremy apparently has invited your wife to karen's wedding. I advised him against it, of course,for your sake. But... There was nothing to be done. What's on your mind,boys? I can't wait to find out. It's blank. Fill it in with whatever figure you think is appropriate. And walk away from karen. Uh,no. I'm not interested. Get off your high horse, mr. Elder. A man of your ilk has a price for everything. Uh,money... Is not what i want. We're listening. I have what is most valuable to you. And you have what is most valuable to me. The company. Your company for your daughter. You sell me all of your shares-- all of 'em-- Voting rights, at a fair market value, and i'll call off the wedding. Nick. Okay,then. I'm sorry. I thought you loved karen. I guess i was mistaken. You obnoxious,little piddling son of a bitch. Hey,hey,no one talks to me that way, not in my house, not anywhere. Nick. I know it hurts to lose her,nick. But i tell you what, i'll make sure she throws the bouquet in your direction. Okay? -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> Dirty Sexy Money Season02 Episode07</font> lisa's just trying to make you jealous. You should take it as a compliment. Well,i feel like i'm in junior high school again. I remember a time not so long ago, my problems were more adult. Well... We're all back in the eighth grade when we're in love with somebody. Yeah. That's for sure. What? What's so funny? Speaking of the eighth grade... Tripp wanted me to... Set up a lunch with you. - Just him and me? - Privately,yeah. Why would he want to have a private lunch? - Isn't it obvious? - Oh,my god. That's... He's sweet, but i just don't see him like that. It's a good day all around,huh? - Okay. How about this? - Okay,what? To solve everyone's problems,why don't you bring me? To the wedding? I don't know. What about tripp? I'll talk to him at the wedding, make my feelings clear. Come on. You and me together, you know we'll have fun. Even the family lawyer can't deny that. All right. You got me. Let's do it. Okay. I'll be blunt. The news isn't good. Your body isn't responding as we'd hoped. - Why don't you just say what you friggin' mean? - Brian. The cancer has spread. Considerably. I'm sorry. That can't be right, because she's feeling better, she has a lot of energy and... So just run the labs again. One of the risks of this drug is that it can mask the symptoms. Kind of a blessing in a way. - Then put her on something else. - No. What do you mean,no? Just put her on something else! No,brian. I'm done. Why don't you two take your time and talk it over? Andrea... You have to. I don't have to do anything. All i wanted was to live my life as peacefully as possible for the rest of my time... However long i have. And you talked me into this. I did it. I'm glad. And it's over. What are we gonna tell the shrimp? I don't know. I must say, i'm a bit surprised. - You want a job... In this office? - Certified. Whatever happened to you being a valet? I got the public service bug. Your campaign was a watershed moment for me. You know,it made me realize that i have one life, And i gotta find a better way to spend it. You don't really want a job here. I do. Dude,i crave employment. No. You just want to be closer to her. Nola? Survey says... She is miles behind me, light-years. - You're sure about that? - Look... I just want to do my part to make new york and america a little bit cooler for everyone. I'd like to think you really mean that. Dude,i'm your man. How is our patient, wrenn,feeling? She's coming along. Well,that's good. Did you make the arrangements for our luncheon? - No,not yet. - Oh,get it done,will you? I really need that little diversion to take my mind off this... Damnable wedding. Why don't we ask wrenn to come to the wedding? That-- that would please me. Well,she's already coming. Really? I'm bringing her as my date. - As your date? - Yeah. Oh,i-i didn't realize the two of you had become fast friends. Well,it's basically just that at this point-- friends. I... Which why i didn't-- i didn't tell you earlier, because-- Well... I-i made it clear, didn't i? Oh,yeah... You did. I - i just... - You know, i mean,you know... - Okay. No,fine. Good. Tripp... It's all right,nick. Actually,it's for the best. There's my baby. Just a silly daydream gone. - Hi,daddy. - Hello,sweetheart. Nick. See you at the wedding? - Yeah. - Okay. Oh,and hey,don't worry. I didn't put lisa at your table. I figured sitting next to your wife and her date could get kind of... Awkward. So... Well,that's very thoughtful of you. If you'll excuse me. - Daddy. - Sit down,sweetheart. I just want to say thank you for letting me have the wedding here. I mean,i know there's-- there's still a part of you that doesn't trust simon. A part of me? He makes me feel safe, daddy. Look,i don't expect you to be completely happy about this right now,okay? Or,well,okay,ever. But i love him,daddy. And in the way that you've always wanted for me, he loves me,too. He does. - He does? - He does. Well... I'll do my best,darling. Thank you,daddy. Hello. It's tripp. I want you to go see simon elder. And do what? Tell him he has a deal. Nick. Come on in. What do you want? You've got a deal. Ah,and what deal do have exactly? Tripp is prepared to sell you his controlling stake in darling enterprises in exchange for calling off the wedding. The old man saw the wisdom. I'm almost impressed. - All right. I'll call it off. - Good. As soon as tripp transfers his shares into my account. Wait a second. Clearly,a deal like this will take days to complete,weeks. The ceremony's in four hours. Is it that soon? I gotta start getting dressed. Come on,nick. You didn't think i was gonna leave karen darling at the altar, Break her little heart in two just because you walked in here and shook my hand? Listen,you work fast, because until this deal is done,Until darling enterprises is mine, the wedding's on. Are you lost? Baby,i'm working. Like you,i is now on the federal dime. Speak english.

He dazzles you with that carolina charm. The next thing you know, you're talking about how you used to walk around in your mommy's high heels. Um,nola,any suggestions for how to get o'connell back to the table Before we lose another 100,000 jobs to california? Get a new father. I have-- i have an idea. No,you don't. Patrick,a word. Does the name billy carter mean anything to you? Roger clinton? Your brother is a piece of baggage you cannot take on this trip to washington. He just needs some direction in life. Okay, the only direction he needs is out the door. Jeremy shows up drunk and disorderly in the tabloids every week. His taste in women runs the gamut from eurotrash b-listers to anorexic pop stars-- To you. I was the exception that proves the rule. Listen,we need you to be taken seriously, and pork barreling your brother Before you've even taken the oath is just silly. Nola, it's only his first day. Patrick,i'll make it easy for you. It's jeremy or me. Your choice. A - all right, all right. I'll... I'll fire him. Great. Well,that's an interesting wardrobe choice. Oh,yeah. I'm changing at the imperial.

Elder will not have the guts to tell karen, So i guess it'll be down to me. If it's all right with you, i'll tell her. Okay. Thanks,nick. Oh,hey,nick. It's not a good time. I'm kinda gettin' married here. - Karen,can we talk? - Yeah. Alone. Okay,girls. What's cookin'? Sorry. I think you might want to sit back down. Okay,nick,you know, i've-- i've played this scene in my head a million times, Of you coming in here and talking to me, and you telling me that you're gonna whisk me off to some-- - I don't know-- - this is not that scene. - I know. - I wish it were, but it's not. Okay,so what's the matter? You're not getting married to simon today. That's... Are... Are you s-sure you're not whisking me away here? - I'm not. - Because that would be... - Better. - I'm not.

Then by the power vested in me by the state of new york, i now pronounce you husband and wife. Tripp darling got emotional, and emotion is bad for business. We're in serious trouble, simon, and getting worse by the minute. - What are you talking about? - Here. See for yourself. It's been a roller-coaster day for darling enterprises. The blue chip surged in early trading on news of a takeover - by billionaire simon elder... - Yeah,so? - Keep watching. - Then plummeted when dozens of c.e.o.s announced they were canceling their contracts with the company. One star research analyst has already published a note to investors That she believes simon elder's new company may face - a serious liquidity cris in the coming weeks... - What the hell happened? He must have planned this from the beginning. You're a losing $100 million an hour,sir. Suddenly be forced to file for bankruptcy protection? Is d.e.stock now worthless? No word yet from simon elder... - Shut it off. - As to how these developments are sitting with the techno magnate. - We'll be bringing you up-to-the-minute updates... - Shut it off! I'm trying,sir. nobody leaves this room until we put this company back together. What are you doing here? What,d-- did you-- did you come to gloat? I guess this was all a part of daddy's plan all along,right? Well,congratulations. You can take the girl out of the darlings, but you can't take the darling out of the girl. How dare you accuse me of anything. I gave myself to you more fully and more freely than i've ever given to anyone. And you traded me away for what, for shares in a company? Hey,look on the bright side. At least now you're free for nick. Oh,simon. You don't get it, do you? All i wanted was you. You're quiet. Are you okay? I'm happy. It's unfamiliar. You're gonna have to tell brian the truth. We're only married 18 minutes, you're already nagging me? I don't think i can do it. Which is exactly why you have to. I'm dying,brian. You have to learn how to communicate with him, Even when it's hard, especially when it's hard. Let's just let him enjoy today,okay? Jeremy,how's it going? Hey,what can i do for you,chief? I am ready,willing and able. - About that. - You okay? Jeremy,it's like this, and i really hate to have to do this here,but-- give that fella medal. Mr. O'connell,what are you doing here? Well,i said no to you in person. Figured i oughta come back to say yes. Yes? Senator,i've decided to accept your offer, and it was this young man that got me to change my mind. - J- jeremy? - Yeah. Really? This is my son-- d.j.pillowhead. What's up? Mr. O'connell. What a surprise. Ms.lyons. Things have,uh, been a little tough for me and my boy ever since, Uh, my marriage fell apart with his mother. Fact of the matter is, we haven't talked to each other for,uh,over a year. I advised my buddy d.j.over here to give his old man a call... Reconcile. My son and i still have some work to do, but we're talking again. And you've got yourself a deal. - Well,wonderful. - Fantastic. Our staff will work out the details. And thank you again, young man. He's a keeper. A keeper. You look lovely. Thank you. You're here with nick? I am,yeah. Well,i've... Often said on many occasions... Nick... Is a lucky man. Actually,i think i'm the lucky one. Well... Whatever comes of it, i couldn't be more thrilled for the two of you. Truly. Well,i have to admit, you throw a mean hail mary. I had to. Youwere trying to get me fired. Get you fired,jeremy? You barely even occur to me. Hello,team. Mind if i steal away my chief of staff for a little spin on the dance floor? She's all yours. See you in the office, first thing monday. - We'll see about tuesday. - Dig it. So tell me, what did tripp have to say? He couldn't have been nicer. Why? No reason. What nick sees in her, i'll never know. I have something to confess to you,my dear. What's that? Upon first meeting wrenn... Getting to know her a little, i allowed myself to reflect, for the first time,really, In our 40 years, on what my life might be like with someone else. E could be your granddaughter. I know. I know. It's absurd. I even went so far as to ask nick to arrange a clandestine rendezvous, a luncheon. But it-- that never came to pass. But seeing her here this evening put my escapade into perspective. And i felt that you should know that i discovered afresh... That you are the love of my life, and you always will be. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Mr. Darling. - Yes,clark. Simon elder's here. He says it's urgent. You screwed me,old man. You sabotaged darling enterprises. Not at all. Not at all. My friends,my colleagues, are free to do business or to not do business with whomever they please. But it is fascinating, don't you find? To see people operating on the basis of something other than the pursuit of financial gain. The company is ruined-- ruined. Well,if you're no longer inrested in controlling darling enterprises, I will buy it back from you at its current market value. You think i'm gonna let you walk away with a 1-day, $10-billion profit? Okay,half the company... At a 20% discount to yesterday's close. So that that way it would only be... $4 billion and change. And what,you and i will... Will be partners? Ironic,isn't it? What do you say? Deal? - Wrenn, you bony little tramp. - Excuse me? How dare you show up at my daughter's wedding and throw yourself at my husband, - A man old enough to be-- - i'm here with nick. - Do you honestly think you're gonna steal my family... - No. - My fortune? - No,i have no intention-- you think i would let that happen? Okay,i-i didn't mean to hurt anyone. I know exactly what you meant to do. You planted yourself in front of my car, you insinuated yourself into my household, And you had every intention of stealing my husband from me, And with him,my future and the future of my family. Get the hell out of my house. Now! Lost your date? Lisa,let's-- let's not do this here. I was... Really asking. Do you rember the summer house? What,the one that you and your family used to stay at when you were growing up? Yeah. I was just thinking of this time in college when me and my roommate drove all night to go there, And when we finally made it, it had been sold and torn down. There was nothing left. That's how i feel about us right now. You know... We could drive all night and try and get back what we had, but it's-- it's gone. It's just... Gone. When i saw you and wrenn at the coffee shop, i was so jealous. So i brought jeremy tonight to make you jealous. But i don't feel jealous anymore. I just feel... Sad. Yeah. It's fine. If you'll excuse me. - Wrenn,wait a minute. - No. I-i have to go. - Why,what happened? - I - i don't know. - I can't be here. I can't be around these people. - Wait. Just tell me what happened. I honestly don't know. One second,i'm talking to tripp about you. Next thing i know, letia is accusing me of coming to the wedding to steal her husband. You know,i made it very clear to tripp that it'syou i'm interested in. I mean,you're asking me what happened. Why don't you tell me? You know what? This started as an accident,and... Maybe it's best if we just leave it at that. So... We're just done? Just like that? Listen,i would love to get to know you better, really. But existing around this family is... Not easy. Trust me. I-i know. Go. And... Don't look back. Tripp. We need to talk,now. What the hell is going on? Mr. Elder has had a nasty case of buyer's remorse. So we're going to bail him out of his predicament. Congratulations. Did you enjoy owning darling enterprises for five hours? Oh,no,no. He's still going to be a major shareholder. I control 50% of the company, to be exact. What's going on,tripp? Well,mr. Elder and i have become partners. Which i-i guess also means that in addition to working for me, you will also work for him. Well... Clearly this is about me and wrenn. That's utter nonsense. It wasn't enough for you to blow up my chance at a relationship with the woman? You're gonna make me pay r it again? Nick,your accusation is incomprehensible. Fine. I'll see both of you on monday morning. Karen,i am so sorry. Go to hell. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=-
