shipping the bodies? Detroit. Who is taking possession? Van Sciver. Marcus Van Sciver. Okay, you can go. You kidding, yes ? Yes. Blade The Series - 101 - Pilot You're lost ? These streets are dangerous. I can take care of myself. Oh, really ? And, uh, these can take care of you. Well, bring them him. Not you. We're gonna go for a little ride. Where are we ? Friend of mine's. - What is this place ? - You're gonna love it, sweetheart. Are you robbing me, asshole ? Just wait here a second, beautiful. What the hell is in there ? Don't worry about it. It's easier if you don't struggle, honey. 50 bucks ? Cheap Whore ! It's a disaster. Just the way you like it. Barred windows. Plenty of space. And, if we get bored, there's a ping pong table in the back. I know how much you love ping pong. Come on ! I've taken you to a half of dozen sites sealed as tight as a frog's ass, you pissed on every one of them. You said we have to move fast. We do. Well then pick a place and throw down your damn sleeping bag. Set up shop. Thanks Marcus. You don't know how much this means to me. You deserve this, Zack. You've been such a good boy ! It's right. But it's, like, the last time you ever really feel pain ? There's only pleasure I had baby. - Hey Marcus. Is there anything I should know ? - Get out of the car. Is there a... speech I need to say or a... prayer or something ? Nobody wants a prayer. We are big on unity, Zack, and trust is an important part of that unity. That's why we brought in here. The House of Chthon has a lot of locked doors. Doors meant to hold my secrets. You've been picking through a lot of keyholes, Zack. - Too many. - Wait, wait ! She's home. Oh, my baby girl's home ! I missed you! I'm back. It's great to have you back. It's great to be back. I heard about the action you saw. You know, I run that support group up in Pyac if you need it. How about that beer ? Works too ! For a while. You should eat something. I will in a little while. Where is Zack ? He was arrested last week. Listen. I'm thinking we should all sit down, have a nice long talk - before he winds up in prison. - Waste of time. Mum ! He's not a bad guy! He's just a little lost ! - Why do you always defend him ? - Because nobody else will ! Look, why don't we just cool down here and think about... Oh, it's probably Zack right now. Is this the family of Zack Starr ? - Yes. Sorry, but there's been a shooting. I know this is very difficult for you, Miss Starr. That's my brother. Twin brother, eh ? Yeah. Harsh. What is that ? Oh, that, it's a gang sign, I've seen it around. He wasn't in a gang. Yeah? When was the last time you saw him? Two years ago. A lot can change in two years. Zack wasn't in a gang ! We are doing everything we can to find out who do this. Hey ! So, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll be in touch. Bryan Boone. Call me, I mean if you need any help. 3 men may be tied to the east side but an identified man fired an assault riffle. This  continues away the violence that hits the city over the last two months. The mayor called it a priority of the city earlier this morning after the body of Zack Starr, an alleged gang member, was discovered by the Detroit river. This is the tenth gang-related death in the last three weeks. Authorities are asking anyone for information to please come forward. Back to you Bill. Have you finished ? Yeah, I'm finished. Security, media feeds and infrared are on. Sun's down. Time to make some new friends. Huh Blade. Try to do this quietly. Yeah, that's my M.O.. How does it feel ? Hum, that hurts. Good tattoo always does. It's not a buttlerfly or a key or some 5-minute shit like that. Doesn't count if you don't need the needle for at least an hour. How long have you been working for Van Sciver ? Tell me! Tell me what I want to know ! Get him off ! What  do you wanna know? Tell me, I'll tell you. What the hell ? I told you I'd talk. Sorry, I didn't hear. You've reached Detective Bryan Booin robbery and homicide, I'm not avalaible right now, but if it's an emergency hang up, then dial 911. Otherwise leave a message after the tone. Zack... Hey  ! Come on in. Oh god ! No, no, no, no, I gotta go. I'm sorry about that, hello. I left some messages. And you are uh ? Krista Starr. Krista St... Oh right, the dealer's sister. My brother wasn't a drug dealer or a gang member. Ok, that took place... Here we go. The, the docks right ? I was just to his appartment and there was this man there going through his stuff. What did he looked like ? Black, dressed in black. Oh black, that narrows it down. But he could be a suspect or he can know something. - Can I see my brother's file ? - No. Maybe I could help, I was a sergent in the Army. Yeah, this ain't the army. Listen, sweetheart. At the end of the day, your brother got caught up and somebody shot him, okay ? Got in over his head, he pissed off the wrong people just like every single one of these guys. My brother isn't like every single one of these guys. Look, people like this, all they end up doing is taking up file space, you understand ? Yeah, I understand. Have a nice day. Boone. Ah, yeah ! - Take it easy, pal! - Hey pancho! Shut that guy up! Son of a bitch. What ? I got hungry too. I need those inhalers. I'm working on it. Work... faster. Dude, most of ??? is destroyed. The serum that keeps the thirst is easy to replicate but inhalers work on a completely different system. You see, they allow you to generate hemoglobine. Humains have genes that develop proteins, but vampires have disabled links between them. These inhalers help diffuse... Figure it out ! You're supposed to be the smart one. Yeah, I'm the good-looking one too. Got any leads on what Marcus is up to ? I cracked open a dozen families last night. If they knew what he was realy doing in Detroit. So would I. Well, can't hide forever. He is Detroit's great white hope. The guy started some kind of Renaissance movement two years ago. Restored a dozen buildings from late 1800s, preached about the historical value of the city ??? his way to in the future, blah blah blah. It's only a matter of time before he shows his smug little face. And when he does, he'll be surrounded by the press. He'll be hard to get close to. And you don't exactly blend in. Damn. - Danny Milano ? - Yeah. Do I know you ? I'm Zack's sister. Don't know him. He's the guy you got arrested with last week. I don't know who you think I am. I'm not. I'm not. Did you kill my brother ? No, no, no freaking way. Why would I wanna kill Zack ? Memory coming back ? All right, yeah. He lived a street from me. We hung around. Who wanted him dead ? I don't know. People disappear around here all the time. What is that ? Gang sign ? It's just a tatoo. Of what ? Psycho bitch! Yeah, hey. Zack's sister showed up. I think we got a problem. Yes ? Professor Melvin Caylo ? Who are you ? What is this ? Let me see. Hello ? Let me see your wrist. - What ? - Let me see them ! And the neck. The neck ! You didn't use it, did you ? Use it ? The hash. It's found its way under the streets now. With the rest of the drugs. Inhale enough of it, it will give you the abilities of the omines nocturni. It is for an hour or two. Though the sad effects. The... The thirst that comes with it. Most end up chewing their own fingers off. The omines nocturni? Vampires.  This is vampire hash. It's quite expensive too. This vial is at least a thousand dollars. Ten if it comes from a pure blood. And I supposed next you're gonna to tell me that werewolves exist. My colleague Mock's area of expertise. Really ? What do you think this means ? This brand's familiar, it's dedicated to the House of Chthon. Humans who ??? their lives or their culture. Hoping to be changed some day. They're everywhere you see, the police, the governement, everywhere. Here. Take this and flush it down the toilet. But I read you were searching for proof. I have plenty of that. Proof. Hum, thank you for your time. Wait ! Come back ! God. What a hell of a day! You okay ? Hello ? Hello ? Hey ! Jesus ! Krista. Krista. Krista. I know who killed your brother. Here. Hurry ! Hello ? You wanna know what happen to your brother ? The wannabe. He is now meat... just like you. Holly shit ! - Those... are... - Were. ... vampires ! And what does that make you ? Something else. What does that mean ? - Oh, god! What is that smell ? - Garlic. They don't like it either. This is impossible. There's a whole other world underneath this one, Krista. Why is it everybody know my name ? Do yourself a favor. Get out of the city ! Forget everything you saw here tonight. Yeah, right ! I can't just forget about this. I mean, I just... Hey ! Vampires exist, young lady. But most people don't see the dangers. So, who the hell is Blade ? My favorite fascination. His parents were Robert and Vanessa Brooks. They lived in Detroit. Vanessa was nine months pregnant the night she was attacked, bitten, left for dead. Robert found her, struggling to survive for the sake of her unborn child outside of their apartment. He rushed her into the hospital where their son was delivered by C-section. Robert named him Eric. The boy aged relatively normally. But he wasn't normal. Yeah, kind of figured it that. Eric went through genetic changes at birth. He was born a different kind of vampire. ??? He has all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses. Ah... except of the thirst. The thirst is what controls all omines nocturni. And no one can fight it. Except for Blade. His father... kept Blade secret. He provided fresh blood for him for the ten first years of his life. Don't ask me how. Until he couldn't handle it anymore. And Blade was loose out on the streets. Until a friend of mine, Abraham Whistler found him and took him in. So we saved Blade from drinking the blood of animals, others... clone suppliers like the House of Lychan. But I know the truth, he  lives off a synthetic serum. Where can I find him ? Well, I will tell you, he hasn't stayed in one place very long. Here uh, the only address he ever had. How can you see with those things ? What are you doing here ? You were following me. You should have left ! You've seen them in the flesh. You've been seen all ??? after you. You know who killed my brother. He was one of them. Let it go ! Help me take out these bastards ! Help you? I'm going after them, with or without you. Silver bullet. Mmh. Doesn't work on me. But I bet it hurts like a son of a bitch. Blade ? - Go ahead. - Go ahead ? I'm not talking to you. What ? News... Van Sciver finished restoring some art gallery last week. Tonight there's a big party and our boy's making an appearence. Good. Good ? Who are you talking to, man? Where are you ? No, no. Dude, that is Zack's sister. Do not get her involved. I'll hold this, you have a job to do. - You're listening to me ? - No, no, Blade. Damn ! Test subject, G1139, baseline trial on batch 97G. Beginning vaccine injection, now. Stand by for Stage 1 confirmation. Introduction of Stage 1 garlic extract now. Stage 1 failure. Moving on to batch 98G. New UV blade is not working. My stuff always works. Isn't all of this a little elaborate ? He likes the pretty lights. What is this ? The fat lady. Oh, the fat lady. Ultrasonic brain scrambler. Finally, something I recognize. Kind of. Customized PDW. We call it a shotgun. One taste of liquid garlic chamber from that monster sends any vampire in anaphylactic shock. Their skin ruptures, their blood evaporates. I know. I saw in action already. So, what about crosses and holy water ? They don't do anything. You don't need this. Why not ? Here, this is a transponder. To track it anywhere in the city. I see, you want me to carry it. We want someone else too. Marcus Van Sciver is a player in the House of Chthon. The largest vampire colony in North America. And tonight you'll be parading around the Van Sciver house gallery. So take him out. I ash Van Sciver. There is a dozen other vampires to step up and take his place. So take them out too. If we can track him, he can lead us to the House of Chthon. If we play this cool, if we have a little patience, we can find out what they're up to, what their operations are. You take this seriously. There's no other way to take it. A big party. Excuse me. This gallery hasn't opened its doors since 1978. How does it feel to be a part of another revitalized institution, Mr Van Sciver ? I'm just doing my best to keep this city alive. Thank you. There's our girl. Of course, Chief Edwards. We always look after our friends. Dr Dideo. Fire chief, councilman. That's the man right there. It's like stepping back in time. Exactly. She's gonna do it ! This building, none would have been possible if it wasn't for the efforts of ten coming up pioneers in the automotive industry. Come on. I am simply... following the legacy they left. Oh, don't be so modest. They say you're the man who's gonna save Detroit. Some do. Gentlemen excuse me. Fritz. Gentlemen. I believe we are all to quick to forget our past. Did you know ? The average age of building in United States is less than 30 years old. Didn't know that. Take this city, it's been around since the 18th century and yet, if  you ask somebody to point out a prominent historical landmark, they probably aim for the Joe Louis Arena. You see the past has been torn down and replaced by something that in a short matter of time will also be torn down and replaced. It's a wasteful cycle. There's only one thing this country values when it comes to old age. So, try to recapture the past ? Just try not to forget it. Me either. So tell me about you. So much to tell. Well, you could just start with a name. Katherine. Katherine ? Now you seem to me to be more like a... Krista ! Man, I told you ! You look familiar. Like someone I once knew. There was this young man, his name was... Zack Starr. And he wasn't particularly bright or assertive. But he was desperate. Desperate for some sort of control of his life. Let go. People like him are always taking never giving, draining on the people around him. Sucking a life from them. Honestly, he's better off. Or at least the world is. Screw this. Where is she going ? What the hell is she doing ? I'm gonna kill her ! Excuse me, Mr Van Sciver. It's okay. She wanted me to give you this. Who ? The woman you were talking to. Hello, Krista. I know what you are. You're watching me, aren't you ? Through a ten power scope attached to the top of a matched grade sniper rifle. Wow, it sounds impressive. You're allergic to garlic so, let's stay away from the gaspacho. I did, thank you. There you are. Tell me more. Sunlight can burn your skin. It will turn you into ash. and I've got a silver bullet ready to blow that stupid smile right of your face. You killed my brother. Yes, yes I did. If you knew who I was, why mess with me like that ? Because it's my nature. You're everything your brother wasn't, aren't you ? A success where he was a failure. Bright... where he was dimmed. Shut up ! Oh come on, Krista, take the shot ! I don't care how fast vampires are. You can't dodge with a bullet moving 2000 meters per second and trust me, I'm a hell of a good shot. What happened ? She screwed up. I'm impressed, Krista. I hope you still are when I'm shoving a stake up your ass ! I killed a lot of people. But your brother, that wasn't out of pleasure. I really did like him. But he was looking around of things he wasn't supposed to. Being too curious. You on the other hand, might just work. What you're gonna do ? Bite me ? Bite you... That's for savages. In truth, it's not the most reliable form of transmission. No. Here is the House of Chthon. We're people civilized. You need permission Marcus. Not this time, no. Just let me kill her and end it. Hush, Chase. Stay the hell away from me ! Oh I know, you're scared. You think of us as sociopaths that just walked out of a nightmare. But this is an honor, Krista. Trust me. There are severe restrictions based on the number of humans we're allowed to turn. We don't wanna attract unwanted attention or put a strain on our food soures. We survive by living in the shadows. ??? It's okay to fight. It's only natural. But you will think so much better, so much clearer once you've been through the change. Now Krista, all you have to do is die. Wake up ! Zack ? He can't catch me, catch me... Ah ah ah ! Over there, I want to tell you something. Zack. Krista, all you have to do is die. You understand ? Please, kill me. Kill me! Hello, Krista. Welcome to the family. You can't stop looking. Body was delivered at the city morgue last night at 2 a.m. Vanished about 3. Has she been turned? Blade, we can't cure her. And the thirst is going to take over by the time the sun rises tomorrow. You find her, you got to stake her. Just like always. The serum ? You mean the chance of that working ? Are what ? Slim, man ! You pump her full of it before sunrise, she might get a clear head for a few hours. But if she feeds off a fresh kill before, then who the hell knows ! And finding her is still a problem. Krista left a loose end out there. I'm gonna tie it up. I would have warned you. But there is something to be said for learning from experience. You've been asleep all day. - I feel... - Alive ? Yeah. Those shoes, put them on. You see Krista, the so-called living. The ones growing obese and passive. Oblivious to the true layers of life. They are the ones you are dead. The dull senses have no abilities to unlock the real beauty of this world. Unlike us. You will learn, soon enough, everything has so many more facets of pleasure. Music, food, sex. Your rebirth is here. Your grihalt. Grihalt? In our language, it means someone who has achieved true life. And as your sponsor, it's my privilege to teach it to you. And to introduce you to our culture. I saw you. And I saw my brother. The images you witnessed are part of your ADE. And after that experience triggered by the genetic memories of your sponsor. And your own synapses, they rebuilt your cognitive functions. The visions you witnessed are sacred, Krista. And must only be shared with someone you really trust. Don't touch me. What did you do to me ? What did you do ? I saved you. Take her with you. This is a mistake. What is ? Her ? Yes, Marcus. And when you were turned, Chase? Everyone starts somewhere. And some... start a lot lower in life than Krista Starr. You will take her on a ride along. And you will teach her. And you will dress her. When the board finds out what you've been doing. Don't question me, Chase! Ever ! I told the sister everything I know. You can't do that ! You can't do that... I'm protected. Not from me. If someone disappears down here, who knows where they go ? I don't know. Give me a name, Danny. He's a cop, Boone. He got the charges on Zack and I dropped. You gotta understand why we do this man. We wanna be like you. Strong, fast. And immortality, man. I'm gonna live for freaking ever. No, you won't. Can you see it ? Krista ? See what ? Relax your eyes. Pull your focus back. Look ! I see something. They can only be read in the ultraviolet spectrum. The House of Chthon's glyph. It means it's ours. Ours ? One of the places we recruit. We also have save houses throughout the city where fresh blood is delivered. If you're out and dawn approaches, you go. But if you see the House of Lychan glyph, stay away. The thirst, it hurts. Yes. You'll drink. Soon enough. Fritz, go. Blade, the transponder's online. I smell it. Me too. Drink. Slowly, take it all in slowly. When did that happen to you ? When did you become grihalt? Marcus told you that, didn't he ? It's his favorite word. He says the same speech to all of them. All of who ? The new born. But with the strict rules we live by, the enemies outside, most of them don't last a year. Did Marcus change you ? No. My husband did. And lived to regret it. He still does. Hey ! You should be careful out there, honey. These streets are dangerous. There a bed inside ? You wouldn't believe what's inside. You are just a little snack thing, huh? Jesus. I thought I told you my pets are on the strict diet. - Hello. - Hi. Don't pull that Dracula shit, sneaking up on people, I almost crap myself. You've been overfeeding them again. And for what ? A few dirty twenties ? I've got something for you. Shit ! Blade. Fat lady's early. Burn her. I told you too many times. All right, all right, I'll stay away ok ? You got to help me now. If I was like you, I mean I could do some much more. Come on ! Make me Marcus. Make you? I've put up with your desobedience and carelessness long enough. Come on man ! I... Wait a minute, you turned her ? That slacker sister ! It's my turn, my... There is no room for someone like you in my inner circle. It's time to cut bait. And unfortunately for you, you're the only person I know she hates. You'll make it easy for her. Now Krista, it's time for your fist kill. That's enough! Live him be. This is something she must do on her own. No... Come along, the new vaccine is ready. Blade's here. Deal with it. Marcus, give me the new vaccine. No. He is here. Let me serve you. Krista ! You can still fight it. It's been fun. His shit always works my ass ! Shen? - Shen ? Shen ? - I'm here, I'm here ! Shen, something's wrong. Shen, make the fat lady sing now ! I hope your earplugs are in, buddy, here we go ! Fritz ? That's enough. You're my new favorite. You've proven our success. Shit ! Fat lady is recharging. She's got one more hit in her. Give me one sec to get her to do it again. She is singing again ! Blade, gotta juice. Coming in. Shen, don't ! Sorry brother. Go, goddamn it ! What did you do ? This stuff doesn't work, but I found you, didn't I ? Up. There you go, big guy. Next time I offer backup you take it. Good day, Fritz. You did well, Krista. How's Chase ? She'll be fine. Marcus, the ??? would like a few words with you, privately. Of course. Excuse me. Marcus ? Yes. The visions I saw when I was changed. The ones with my brother, what did they mean ? What did you see ? Him and I, a long time ago as kids in this story book village we used to go to. Zach wanted me to chase him. He was trying to show you something. What should I do ? What you have been, follow him. My stuff always works. Not this time ! Where did you hit him ? Then it's something else. So what the hell are they doing here ? What did you do to me ? I injected you with a serum, to get you thinking straight. Krista, Krista ! That cop, I ripped his throat out. I killed him. Listen, if you take this serum twice a day, it might keep the thirst under control. Look, you wanted in, and you're in. In as far as you can go. You're one of them. So are you. You can learn so much. I can work with you. Just like I worked with your brother. My brother ? Zack worked for you ? Yes. He was my contact here. - Oh my god, you got him killed. - No, Marcus did. But Marcus was wrong about him. He was a good man. Give me the serum. I got to get back. What do you think ? Could go either away. No !!! Next time on Blade. I need information on Fritz. Like what ? He's not your every vampire. I'm beginning to think you like this. You're sure the vaccine is stable ? Yes, it's stable. Then perhaps a new day has dawned.
