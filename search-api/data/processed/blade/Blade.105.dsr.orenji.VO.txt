- You're sure the vaccine is stable? - Yes, it's stable. Trace those. Tell me who bought that. Doctor Vonner... No!!! What do you know about the House of Lychan? You can't go Krista. They have this ritual. You've ever heard of a sweat lodge, the native American thing where you see visions? What, they want me to see Boone? That's the idea, except there's no sweat. Just lots of blood. If it will stop Boone... I'm doing it. Hey sis'! Zach? How you doin'? I missed you so much! Mmh, I missed you too! How is Mom? She's ok. Too bad she doesn't know you're a vampire. She's not gonna know. What are you doing out here? What do you mean? I mean, right place, wrong time. I need to feel the sun. You need to finish what you started. Zach, I want to be done. Oh sweetie, it's just beginning. Boone's in there. The eyes of Texas are upon you, all the live-long day The eyes of Texas are... Badada.. Come on honey, we got miles to go before you'll sleep. Next stop, Silvan Louisiana, you're gonna meet my new best friend. Hell, put the hammer down, might even make it there by midnight. What do you think? I think so too. Help her! Did you see Boone? Where is he? She needs a moment Chase. What did you see? I know, I know! What? I know where he's going. I know where he's going. You didn't really think Marcus was going to pay his last respects, did you? Not in the middle of the day. No. There is that. - Anything else of interest? - Yeah. People loved this guy. After him we knew. I bet some of them did. Well, she's cute. She's pregnant. Figures. The question is... with what? Blade - 105 - The Evil Within Krista connected. Boone's next stop is a small town in Louisiana. Some place called Silvan. Silvan? Does that mean something? There's a splinter faction there. Of what House? The House of Armaya. Domic's faction. You don't think Boone can really get an audience with a Pure Blood, do you? I'm not willing to risk it. I want you in Silvan. I'll send a team to meet you there. I'm sending Krista back. No! Use every asset. If he gets to Domic and he discovers what we've been doing here. He won't. Just kill him and come home. I'm tying up some of Dr. Vonner's loose ends and I'll need you to secure them. Krista. How are you feeling? Thirsty. What? Five hours. You were under for 5 hours and 9 minutes to be precise. Until now the longest time for a lychan blood ritual was 27 minutes. So after doing a little research in the archives, I've come to the conclusion that there are 2 possible explanations for this. One, you don't want this vampire Boone found, for either conscious or subconscious reasons. So you rejected the connection for as long as possible. Of course I want him found, Marcus wants him get... Or two, you're rejecting the world of death that Marcus and Chase have led you to. Which would make things very complicated. Now, is there anything you'd like to say? Boone and I, we had a... relationship. And all that went flash. Yes. And that's why you've fought the connection, because you don't want him killed. Yes. Yes! Alright then. Get dressed. We're leaving. She needs to rest. She needs to go and so do I. One more minute of listening to you yap on about solace and serenity and I'll ash myself. Please. You know... You once were such a vampire. I still am. Sweetheart, you're not even close. Her name is Vanessa Sims. She's 26, grew up in Cincinatti, moved to Detroit in 98. She does temp work, mostly secretarial, waitressing, all minimum wage stuff. Married? No, and no boyfriend that I can see. How do you know that? Her movie rentals are all chickflicks. Hundreds of them. That she watches on her brand new HD plasma TV costing over 9000 dollars, thank you very much. Fat pockets. A whole lot fatter than a few weeks ago. You think they're paying her to carry a vampire baby? She's carrying something. Yo yo, what's up, what you need, brother, what you need? Smoke, coke, ups, downs, point where you want to go baby, I'll get you there. You know what I'm saying? Oh, oh, my man looking to get sideways. Ok, baby, I can get that to you, you know what I'm saying... Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, what??? What??? What, you're selling here without my say-so? N-no, baby, don't work that way. You know what I'm saying? Move! So what? You want it, uh? Come on! What you got brother? Bring it. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Now! Tonight! Let's go! The girl is alive in there. It's about freaking time. You Armayans got some shit to learn about how to treat your guest department. I had a grandmother that looked like you. Had less teeth, but still much prettier. Yeah, that was pretty fun. Last night she looked even better with my dick in her rear. And which one of you beauty is Domic? Mr Domic is not here. What do you mean, he's not here? Come on, what is this? We will deliver the message. So what is it? No, no, I ain't come always to end up with a bunch of junior level students. I speak to Domic and nobody else. Aah, so now you think you're worthy of an audience with a Pure Blood, uh? Yeah, like that means anything. You desorganized idiots haven't had a seat at the table a long time, pal. So shove your desillusions of grandeur up your ass and go fetch Domic. Chop, chop! Oh yeah, and tell your boss I come bearing a nice goddamn gift. ** but her seal ain't been broken if you get my drift. Very considerate of you but you know Mr Domic will still want to know what your message is about? What's it about? Revenge. Oh yeah, I've done my homework on you Armayans. I know all about you backward bastards. Sucking high in tit. And I know that same high ranking son of a bitch that backstabbed me has been disappearing you guys for the last few years. Oh yeah, I know about that. I know who's doing it and why. And Domic's gonna want to know it too. It's time for a little payback brother. Let me make a call. Get down! Let's go! Dust 'em all. Boone! Go! Go! Move! *** Go! Move! Go! Go! Move, bitch! Boone stop! Wow, wow, wow, now look you gotta understand. Me and Marcus had an agreement, but he doublecrossed me. He threw me to the wolves, shit, he threw me to you, you bitch! Let her go. Do what? You're kidding? This meat means something to you? No more killing. No more. No more killing? It's a tall order, sweetheart. I'll tell you what, why don't you suck on this instead? No!!! Where is Boone? Go! Go! - Go! - Shut up! Predictable piece of shit! Shut up! Shut up! Come on, what do you see? Courtesy flush. - Boone's dead? - Yes, no thanks to you. Finish your little snack. She's long gone. Then so are we. - Is he in? - Yes, but, uh... I ccompletely agree. And if there's anything else I can do to help, please do not hesitate to contact. How goes the day job? They want another environmental impact report on the Bristol Park project. If you'd like I could impact their environment. Now you've done enough for one night. But thank you for taking care of our Boone problem. Both of you. Our little war hero didn't miss a beat. Expect for getting the munchies in the middle of the fire fight. Momentary laps. And how is your ex-husband? I was thinking, if I had a little time, I go back and castrate him. Well, there was somewhere else I would rather you go. Krista, will you excuse us? Of course. So, where am I going? Berlin. I need you to safeguard something for me. Our future depends upon it. Something to do with Aurora? This goes beyond on Aurora. What are you doing? I'm asking you for help. And this must remain a secret. Or the Pure Bloods will kill us all. Why would they do that? What are you planning? I can't tell you yet. Just know that it is very important. Alright. Thank you. Mr Van Sciver? There's someone to see you. No more visitors, Sabine. Sir, it's a Pure Blood. Chase. Ah, this is a surprise. Thank you, Thorne. Charlotte, if you told me you were coming... You would have done everything in your power to make me believe I haven't a care in the world. Yes. But that, as we both know, would be just another of your many... lies. Son of a bitch! You're good. No... no I need more. I need more. You've had enough. Krista. I saw his kills... Boone! I know. You know what I'm feeling? Besides guilt? That's just it I don't feel guilty. What I... what I feel is... is left out! I'm jealous. Cause of the way... his freedom! The way he can just... he can just be and I can't. What is happening to me? You'll get through this. Why, because you did? You're half-human. I've nothing human left. Eyes up. Oh, Jesus! What can you tell me about her? What is it? Her name's Vanessa. Marcus had me deliver something to her. She wanted me to thank her doctor. Her doctor's dead. Of course he is. - I need to find her. - Why? She's pregnant. What's that got to do with Project Aurora? Has Marcus ever mentioned this place here? It's in Berlin. Marcus just send Chase to Berlin. This vampire safe house must be where she's headed. I have people. They tell me it's gotten busy. Somebody just arrived that fits Vanessa's description. This isn't just us, is it? What you got, some sort of a underground network? Do they know I'm working for you? Or is one of them gonna kill me one day, thinking they're doing you a favor. You have to be careful. What if I kill one of your friends? Cost of doing business. How close are you to getting your hands on the Aurora vaccine? - Krista? - I'll get it! There's a med lab underground, heavily protected. Just gotta find a way in. Get it before I get back from Berlin. Aurora could change the entire game. We can't let that happen. I'm never gonna see the sunlight again, am I? If you do, it'd the last thing you ever see. The wound on her neck, and where tissue was lacerated is consistant with an animal attack, a wild dog maybe. Where was she found? Out by St. Langrish parish, about 5 miles west of here. A trucker found her walking alone on the side of the road. What's out that way? Mostly swamp. Did she say anything to anybody? When they wheeled into the E.R. she was jibber jaberish on something about a lady helping her. A lady? Yeah. Or maybe a... a soldier, somebody with a gun, E.M.T.s couldn't make much sense of it and then she lost consciouness. Tricia? I want you to look at something for me. Oh, that's not a good idea. Here. Right here. - Hold on, you're upsetting her. - You can shut up or you can leave. No, you don't understand. Her larynx... What? What? This? This right here, what... this is what he looked like? There's still the question of the vaccine's long term viability. - And Doctor Vonner's death affected us how? - Not at all. I'm moving forward. When will you reach it? 5 weeks. We'll have to accelerate final testing. At no additonnal cost to the board. But at what cost to the stability of the Twelve Houses. I know about Boone. You've got a little problem there, don't you? Not anymore. Boone's dead. We got to him before there was any trouble. What sort of trouble might there have been, Marcus? Domic. Boone gets to Domic, tells him we've been experimenting on his people. Just the sort of thing, the House of Armaya might need to turn this into full scale war. That didn't happen. Not yet. When Domic does find out what we've been up to. They're to fractured and desorganized to cause any problems. Domic didn't survive as Armaya's last remaining Pure Blood by shutting those beedy little eyes of his. And it won't just be the House of Armaya that comes after us. At least 5 other Houses will join them. They don't even ever have a seat at the council... Armaya may be exiled but that doesn't mean they don't have sympathisers. And if there is a war, we will loose, unless Aurora works, unless we can strike first, in day light. It will work. It'd damn well better. Well, I'm tired, I've had a long day, and I'd like to rest. I thought you'd be taking the plane back. No Marcus, I will be staying here tonight. If you could have my room prepared. Of course. And Marcus... Yes. Bring me something to eat. Something young. How close are you to get your hands on the Aurora vaccine? Just gotta find a way in. Papers are proved and ready? Just get 'em to Chase. Tell her not to hurt anyone but to make the implication clear. Yes, Sir. T unnels. What is your business in Germany? Pleasure. You have a place in mind? Waiting for confirmation on the adminities. According to my sources, a positive Berlin institute has exactly what you're looking for. And to aid you in your travels. Hey. Good morning, have a nice coma. There's something wrong with my baby? Everything's fine. Where am I? You're safe, just relax. I have to get up. Shh, you really must relax. Give your body a chance to incubate your pride and joy. Sound like a good idea, Who are you? The big bad wolf. Now go back to sleep before I huff and puff and blow your head off. Security check, talk to me. That's all clear. Second floor clear. Walk everything down. Double check it. Perimeter? Perimeter is good too. Ja, it's secured, ja. Chase, come in, I'm on the first fl... It is Chase, say again? I'm on the first floor. No one goes in or out but me. Who are you? You stay away from me! You stay away from... Are you the devil? Whatever works. Goddamn it! She wanted to see me. Is everything alright? It's fine Gonesse, I was just waiting for the sunrise. So how long has it been Gonesse? Since you were turned. This May, it will be 52 years. So you must still dream of it. Dream of what? The sun. I do, sometimes. Don't feel guilty. It's only natural. A part of who you used to be. I've never felt it. Pure Bloods, born as vampires. - We've never known day light. - You will. When Mr Van Sciver delivers Aurora. If that's even his plan. Madam. I believe we may have a problem with Marcus. Tell me what to do. I want an internal audit, top to bottom. Covered investigation into everything the House of Chthon is involved with. Everything on the books and off. I want phones tapped, cars tailed and I want you to focus on Marcus Van Sciver. I want whoever he's turned from the moment he first tasted blood until now investigated. Yes, madam. And Gonesse, do this quietly. Screw all of them. Hold Krista. You miss your world. The one you left behind. Yeah, and I want it back. That's impossible. Can come close... with this. Doesn't work. You're lying. Not at the moment. I saw Fritz. Fritz was an unexpected and quite frankly unwanted success. In couple of days, he would have started to decompose. Is that what you want? To die? Don't touch me. Aurora's effects are temporary. It is simply a stepping stone. To what? A better world, for all of us. - You mean for vampires. - I mean for the House of Chthon. From the dying ashes of one world, we will emerge into better one. You make it sound like apocalpyse. Destruction is always required before rebirth. Now, you have 2 choices. You can ever join me in this new life. Or you can die in your old one. Trust me, Krista. There is nothing left for you but the life I can offer. Stop fighting. Stop wanting. Let go and come with me. Be with me. Forever. Next time on Blade... Come on! What did he do to you? I'm not telling you anything, you freak. No! No! Is something wrong with my baby? Blade. Boone is dead. Domic learnt nothing from him. He knows. Charlotte! Domic. Armaya is back in the fold by Friday.
