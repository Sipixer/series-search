- Mom is fine! She's not fine Krista, she's sick! What's wrong with her? Blade. Blade? Yes I know. I want you in Berlin tonight. - What's in Berlin? - My property was stolen. I want you to find her and bring her back to me. - Silver has no effect on Blade. - I know. I'm in a war. With you. I better look like it. - What happened? - Blade happened. I salvaged what I could. Blade got nothing. We reached out to help you. You bit us for it. You were killers way before I even met you. Another time, little man. Hello, Donny. Looks like your past is... finally coming back to haunt you. What do you want from me? This! Did you call your friend at the CDC? When did I become your secretary? You wanna dial her up, just hit that key, right there. I *** the choice to fill. I don't do this. That's cause I do everything. Didn't fix the AC in the car yet. Maybe you should look into getting the bad-ass summer-weight coat. Hey, you gotta stop biting me, - I'm going as fast... - Do you know what it is? Like I said before, not completely. You got the sample 3 days ago. Yeah, and I got access to CDC computers 9 hours ago. You're stressing everybody, dude. What have you learned in 9 hours? Ok, I think it's a key hole virus. - A key hole virus? - Yeah. A virus targeted at a specific DNA sequence. So, it's targeted at one person? People, I think, a race maybe, even a species. Human or vampire? Working on that now. When will you know? I'll call you when I have something. Later. First Marcus is trying to make vampires immune to their weaknesses. And now, he's trying to make a virus that wipes out, what? If your girlfriend worked faster, we'd know. Can I make a suggestion? Take a walk. I hear the houseware on the fifth floor is wide open, with nothing but dark empty space. Go chill. What's that? A name just tripped the system. Donny Flanigan. What happened to him? He died... oddly. Went down a few minutes ago. He was an ex-cop. Blade? Who is it? Blade The Series - 107 - Sacrifice Mom? Hold on, they're here. She has leuchimia, stage 4. It's chronic lymphocytic. She's on Pyridazine, Dolasetron and Predozon. Mom? The ambulance is here ok? No hospital. She's been coughing up blood for the past 15 minutes. Let's go, let's go! Krista, I'm not going to the hospital. - I want to stay here. - No, Mom, you're not staying here. Krista, I'm not dying in a hospital. They can do what they need to here. I'm not leaving my home. Krista? Krista? Right now, the best thing for her is to do what she wants. Right now, the best thing for her is to stay alive. That's not gonna happen Krista. We  gotta let her go. No, we don't. Radio made it sound like crime scene techs will be here in 15. We don't have much time. When I'll clear the room, you'll be in there. Ok? Yeah? Yeah. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to clear this room. I need a minute alone to process this. Ok. This is going to come up a suicide. We'll see. I'm sorry did you know him? Yeah. Ok guys, let's go! This wasn't a suicide. Gun hand's broken. He was a cop, maybe he had ennemies. You knew him? Yeah. Eric Brooks, how you doin' kid? - Hey Flanigan. - You feeling better? Sleepy. That's what you get for running into the countryside, uh? Viola is gonna get you all fixed up. Make a fist, honey. Hey, I brought you some uh, some comic books. All *** heroes. - The Avengers. - Yeah, you bet! Gonna have a lot of holes in you. That's for sure. No. Viola says that I'm healing. That's right. Hole today, gone tomorrow. Hey you just lay back and get some rest. And I'll check on that in a couple of hours. Ok. You stay cool, ok buddy? No  more funny stuff now, you hear? You rest. Yes, Daddy. Thanks Donny and Viola. - I don't know how he's doing it. - He's a kid. Sneaking out is what kids do. No, it's like he's a ghost. Yeah, well, at least we know he is not a ghost. Robert, I'm having a problem at work. They're getting suspicious about the blood. I  don't think I can keep up these deliveries. You just start tapping me again. We can't do that forever! What about the guy at the slaughter house? - The cow blood was... - No! This stuff just made him sick. Can we talk about this professor Caylo guy? I mean, he knows people, people who might be able to, I don't know, talk... Come on! He's just some crazy asshole movie freak. He's gonna tell you my son is some kind of monster. Robert, he's not going to be a boy forever. You can not keep him locked up. Out of school, away from the world! He's going to find out what he is soon enough. And how are you going handle that? I'm is father. I'll handle it. Blade? There's something in his mouth. What's that about? It's about me. Does that hurt? No. Cover the other eye please. Good. Can you read that? There's nothing on it. Ultraviolet spectrum. It's a glyph from one of the Houses. M-mmh, Armaya. You should know that. I do. Look I'm fine, can I go? Your arm isn't fine but it's healing. Wear these until you don't need them anymore. I heal from everything. Except the silver stake through the head. Too much exposure to the sun. Garlic, but I guess you know all those rules by now. Yeah. What if I was sick before I was turned? I've seen cases of MS cured over night. Cripples walk again. Mortality and immunity. That's why some of the familiars are so desperate to be turned. I got to go! Where to? Chase, I haven't seen you in a while. Butterfly isn't ready to emerge yet. How are you feeling Krista? I'm thirsty. You haven't been drinking enough. You'd be healing faster if you had. - Why don't we take you down to the feeding room? - No! I need to get out. I want a fresh kill. Maybe I'll come with you. We had fun, didn't we, last time? Actually, Chase, I need you for something else. Happy hunting. What do you have in store for me? The details are there, but in general terms. Per our agreement. The money we fronted Marcus to produce the Aurora vaccine it's been laundered through his legitimate businesses. Dispersed through the global network of harvesters. The money went nowhere else? Not that I can see. He's either a very good boy or he's very good at covering his tracks. No evidence of a side project. Or something we didn't contract for? Not so far. I still have two investigators in the field. How soon before we get Aurora? Madam, I'm not sure Aurora will ever be delivered. Or if it is, it will make us immune to our weaknesses. And why is that? Marcus has shut down all the facilities except one outside Reno, Nevada. Per our arrangement with Domic. Aramayans are being delivered but soon after their arrival they're being destroyed. Prior to testing. It seems so. So Marcus is making theater. Trying to delay us? Or distract us. From what? From whatever Berlin was perhaps. I would like more time to investigate Marcus' women. Chase? She's been with him for years. No, the new girl. Krista. Marcus killed her brother a few days before she fell into Chthon. Killing a sibbling is a common lure. I've used it myself. Still there's something off. Something of influence that I can't quite see. Alright. Investigate. Now, did you bring me what I asked for? Lovely. Gonesse, you never disappoint. Oh, look at you. I could just eat you up! Yes I could, yes I could. I smell blood. Who was he? A friend. Check. Take a moment now. I've been taken a lot of moments. In this moment you'll see the trap I leave for you. I saw it. You don't see my way out. I got you beat. What? Do you see it? You knew where I was going? Because I was thinking like you. What were you thinking like? Shining knight on a powerful horse riding to the rescue? Learn to think like your opponent. Or lose every time. Checkmate! I have to say you had worried. For a while there. Yeah, you bet I did. E ric? Mr. Brooks? Mr. Taka please, just stay out of this. Eric, get up. Get over here. Eric? Eric? Dad? I don't feel so good. It's uh... It's gonna be ok, just uh, we'd better go home, come on, let's go. I was playing the game. There'll be other games here. Let's go. Shen? I'm awake. Find Viola. I'm working on it. Any guesses as to who's done this? A few. You wanna share? Not yet. Now focus. I am focused. As focused as I've ever been. Got something. What? Viola Watkins, changed her name in 1981. To what? I, uh... I don't know yet. Why you think she changed her name? I'm sure she had her reasons. Dad? Yeah, son. Is something happening to me? Yeah. There is. What  are you gonna do? I'm gonna help you, I am. We're gonna fix this together. You and me. Why? Am I broken? No. Just special. We just gotta be extra careful. You said there was somebody. Somebody who could help. Yeah, I got a name. It's a guy who's had experience with this sort of things, but... well, would you got to know something... What? If you do this, everything is gonna be different, I mean, forever. Alright. What's his name? Mr. Brooks? Yeah. I'm here about the boy. I'm Abraham Whistler. These would be the only things that could stop him if he was a true vampire. But he ain't. So what is he? He's a Daywalker. Born of a woman who was bitten but not yet turned. In time he will come to possess all their strenghs but none of their weaknesses. When will that happen? As soon as he starts feeling thirst. Something neither he nor you will be able to control. What he is trying to tell you, Robert... Your boy is unstoppable. But he's not like the others. And he's not even a Pure Blood. And what the hell is a Pure Blood? Born vampires. They're the elite, the rules of the Houses, everything, power, influence, evil... Flows from them down to the ***. ***. But your son is different. It will be a force to be reckoned with. So what do you want to do with him? Enlist him in the fight. They're giving us a weapon. We can either use it or kill it. So you want my son to help you. Start some kind of war. You're not listening to me. War is already raging. Your boy is at a crossroads. Now he's tasted blood. He's got to killer insticts now. At this moment, we can decide who he's gonna destroy. Innocent people? Or those responsible for his pain. And yours. What? Eric? Eric? Eric??? Mr. Taka? Mr. Taka? Mr Taka? Quit making so much noise, man! Just open the safe. Come on, come on! Hurry up, old man. I ain't gonna say it again. Look, listen to me! If this thing ain't open in 3 seconds, my  boy here is gonna cut your heart out, alright? Leave him alone! Eric! No! Pit, he's gonna look! No! What have you done? Dad? Oh my god... Step aside, Mr. Brooks. I'm ok, I'm ok. You said me and you would get through this. You lied. You don't want me anymore. Eric. No Eric, stop! Oh my god! Oh Eric. I'm gonna find her. Can I ask you a question? What? Since you mom passed away, was your dad and Viola... Yes. Maybe he's a target of all this. He's not. Uh, you're sure? He's dead, I'm sure. Got it. Names and addresses... Place and employment. Set the alarms. Let's go. What's her name? Sally Porter. Oh yeah sir, do you have an appointment? Yes. She was going to give me a tour of the facilities. For my mother. Oh yeah absolutely, you know give me one second and I'll just track her down for you. I'm Sally Porter. How can I help you? Hi. How she's doing now? She's doing ok. She's been talking about you. You have a birthday coming in? No, I don't. It's the morphine. She thinks you're gonna be 6. She's been shopping. A music box. Yeah. I still have it. Look, if you wanna go, I can stay until, uh, just before dawn and if you can get another nurse. Yeah, the day shift nurse, I can get her here by 5. Thanks. Right, have a good night. Can I, can I ask you how long? Well, it's difficult to say. It might be 2 days, I wouldn't say more than a week. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thanks for everything. Hey! You're gonna be late. You can't afford to be late. Late for what? For school. You better go or you're gonna miss the bus. It's not a school day. It isn't? Well, then. Why don't you sit here with me? We can stay together for a while. We can stay together forever if you want. Would you like that? Honey... that would be wonderful. Sally Porter? Where is she? She's giving a tour... Boy, that is some serious bling you got getting on there. Where is she? Down in rehab. This isn't good. Come on, Viola! Come on back! Eric? Oh my god! Oh my god! Are you alright? No, no, he's killing everyone! Do you know who it is? - He had these... - Steppin' Razor! Do you know where he's going? Home, your home. He's going to kill your father. Viola, my father's dead. No, honey... he's not. He came back to town 2 months ago. He's here because of you. Stay with her. I was wondering when you'd turned up. Well, you'll stop wondering. You killed him too? I wouldn't had to if you'd gotten your stories straight. You said your daddy been shot, you saw him die. That's what I saw. Uh, I think that's what you hoped. The good thing is his girlfriend was a nurse. Where is he? Where is he? Out to lunch, gone fishing. That doesn't matter now, does it? It's just you and me now. Another second, it'll just be me. Sure. You know if you ask me... he's been keeping an eye on you. You hit Detroit. And guess what? He shows up, he... He kinda gets me. Right here. Just like old times, uh? Hello, son. They're dead, Flanigan, Taka... He did that? Viola? She's alive. You saved her. Son? There's some things we need to talk about. I'm not interested! Eric, you got to know, I was never ever gonna let you go! You're not a monster, you're... you're my son. Not anymore. You couldn't accept me. What could I do, tell me right now, tell me, what the hell could I do? Go to hell! Eric... That's not my name! And you're not my father! He was the vampire who attacked my mother. You just the guy who was stuck holding a bag. Please, please... If you wanna live, get as far away from me as possible! Mr. Gerrard, I'd like to talk to you. So when did my nephew's murder become a federal case? It hasn't. I'm looking for your niece, Krista. Why? What's she done? Nothing that I know of. You know where I can find her? No, I don't. I mean she's here in Detroit but uh, I don't know where she's staying. I called her mother's house, I spoke to the nurse. You did what? - I understand the situation... - Yeah, well maybe, you don't. Krista has pretty much checked out of this family. After his brother Zack was killed, she kinda went off the rails. She's hanging out with a different crowd now. What kind of crowd? Ever heard of Marcus Van Sciver? No, who he is? This town's answer to Donald Trump. So what Krista is doing with him? God only knows. Oh, there's my sweetheart. Hey, mom. Do you know how much I love you? I think so. Mom, I don't want you to go. I have to. There's nothing more we can do. Yes, there is. What is that? It's medecine. But I can't give it to you yet. We have to do something first. What do we have to do? It's gonna hurt. But only for a minute. And then what? Then you won't feel anything. And when you wake up, I can give you this. And we can be together forever. That's nice. Honey! Honey, what are you doing?! No! I love you, mom! Wasn't that touching? - Give it back. - Don't waste your breath! I've been following you all night. Mr. Van Sciver will be interested to know that you have somehow required a large stash of... What is this exactly? FBI, hold it!
