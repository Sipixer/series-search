to get you thinking straight. Aurora's effects are temporary. It is simply a stepping stone. To what? A better world, for all of us. I believe we may have a problem with Marcus. Tell me what to do. I think I'm looking for a monster. They're all monsters, let someone else do it. Is she dying? With a bone marrow transplant she's got a good chance. I can't do it. - What do you mean? - I mean I can't! It's medecine. But I can't give it to you yet. We have to do something first. Then we can be together forever. No! No! Mr. Van Sciver will be interested to know that you have somehow required a large stash of... What is this exactly? FBI, hold it! Oh shit! You got the serum from the Daywalker, didn't you? You work for him? How unlucky for you! Take your last breath, you traitorous bitch! Silver, mirrors are backed with it, didn't you know that? Good bye. What the hell is...? Hold it! You need to get out of my way. What are you? Krista? Blade The Series - 108 - Turn of the Screw We should do something about that. Blade? It'll heal. It always does. You're going after him? Who? Your father. Man, I... I'd do anything to get my old man back. Difference between you and me. - Look, I'm just saying... - I need serum. Shen. What was she doing? I was under the impression Van Sciver was serious about this venture. He wouldn't have sent me out here, if he wasn't. He's offering me 4 million dollars less than he promised don't come to my club and give me blue balls. He's giving you 2 million over the market price. Marcus considers this a personal favor. Really? If he wants to play in Vegas, he'll pony up. He has 2 days before I move on to another buyer. - Mr. Taylor... - And you tell Marcus next time he wants to screw me, he should do it face to face. Shawn? Do you know who that is? She's from *** on business. Tell me where she's staying. - Someone got dusted. - Krista? I doubt it. Cytoxin? That's a chimio therapy drug. Her mother has cancer? Had. So when did she die? Probably after Krista stole my serum. She turned her mother. That's what it looks like. I can't find her. Help me. What's this? Well, I saw you in that club, and you looked uh, lonely. And you want to what? Keep me company? Sure, why not? You look good, Chase. That's the best you could do, after what, 60 years? 63, but who's counting? Apparently, you are. I've waited for you, you know. All night. And then, every night after that, for months. Surrounded by your fair share of champagne and starlets I'm sure. And I'd given 'em all up, if you had left Marcus. Let's leave the past where it belongs. You're here now. Yes, I am. She was dying. That's what humans do. Who shot you? I don't know. I think he was a cop. A cop? I've never seen him before. Who did you ash? Some woman, she came after me. From Chthon? No, I don't know! - But she saw you, with serum. - I took care of it! You know, my mother is out there somewhere and we got to find her. Did you inject her before she went out the window? Did you? - We have to take care of this. - What does that mean? Blade. The serum worked for her, I mean it kept her thinking straight. Maybe it's not too late for her mother. Give her your jacket. Where was she going? I don't know. Some place she thinks it's safe. Where would that be? Oh no! Lisa? Pat? Before Vegas, it was in Hong Kong. Before that, Rio. Been traveling for a while, trying to get some distance. From what? The House of Erebus is becoming increasingly conservative. Claiming in the old ways, the old laws... The other Pure Bloods, they're afraid. Of what? Losing their grip. And you're not? Well, I've never had a grip on anything. I beg to differ. Yes. But you got away, didn't you? You're a Pure Blood. You were born a vampire, and I was turned. I'm unworthy. Come on, Chase, that is so old world. It's not me anymore. You're still with Marcus? Of course. But is he with you? Your master's voice. Excuse me. Hello, Marcus. You didn't close the deal? No, it didn't go well. Nothing has since Berlin. What's wrong with you, Chase? You said you were ready to come back to work. - I am. - Let me talk to that prick. So what's the problem? Taylor is playing hardball, he won't budge on the price. You assured me you could do this. Do I need to send someone else out there who can make this happen? No, I'll get it done. The clock is ticking. - I thought you were his favorite. - Things change. Let me guess... Tall, brown hair. How did you know? When things get stressful, Marcus reverts to his old bad habits. What does that mean? His wife. Tall... brown hair... Really quite the beauty, until she wasn't, but I guess we all have our weaknesses, uh? - I didn't know he was married. - Oh yeah. A long time ago, it didn't end well. Then again, what does? I have missed you. I haven't thought of you once. Maybe it's time for you to get out. Maybe it's time for you to shut up! Close the deal and get out. I will, I have to. What are you up to, Chase? I need change. What do you mean? Vegas. I could leave Detroit. Run things from out here. Put a little space between Marcus and I. What for? Is he hurting you? No. Not yet. It's complicated. Alright. Then what is Taylor asking for? Four million. It's a drop in the bucket for a guy like Marcus. I think he wants me to fail. Why? I almost died in Berlin. Blade. I got burned. I think Marcus lost faith in me. All he needs is an excuse to replace me. Then he's a goddamn fool. Lisa? Lisa. I called the house but nobody's there. Nobody's answering. Is the nurse there? Lisa? You chill to the bone. Do you wanna go to the hospital? Alright, alright... Well, let me take you home. I don't want to go back there. I don't feel very well. What the hell is that? Ok, I'm gonna call 911. Come on, pick up that goddamn phone. I think I need something to eat. Please hang up, and try your call again. Please hang up now, this is a recording. Please hang up, and tr... Krista. Oh no! No! Is he dead? Yeah. - What are you doing? - Make it sure he stays that way. Where will she go now? I don't know. - Think. - I don't know!!! They are all dead! My entire family is... dead. Not yet. But the sun is coming up soon. Let's go. She's hanging out with a different crowd now. Ever heard of Marcus Van Sciver? Van Sciver Incorporated, how can I direct your call, hello? Hello? Krista. All you have to do is die. Welcome to the family. Family? Hey, is somebody down there? I didn't see you sign in. Hey? Is this somebody in here? You're beautiful. You already have me in bed. You can stop. No, please continue. It's a hell of a show. Marcus? Get dressed. We're leaving. Wow, no! Wait. You don't wait, you don't listen to him! You get up and you get dressed now or I will kill you before you take another breath. You were here to close a deal, not to whore yourself out to a degenerate Pure Blood. Wouldn't you rather just, cut the insults and rip my throat out. Oh that's right you can't, because I am a Pure Blood. And what are you? You're just... infected. Which is all you'll ever be. Doing our biddings, serving our will. Yeah. Vampires like you it's... nothing but pieces of meat. They got a reprieve. Thank you of reminding me of that. Chase? Chase? It's getting dark. It's time to go. Where? To the cemetary. Your brother's grave. My dead brother is not the problem. Your mother is. She might be dropping by just to say hello. Mothers are like that. So we're gonna go stake out a cemetary? Until you come over with something better. A.D.E. What? - After Death Experience... - I know what it is. My mom had one when I turned her. Which means she saw you being turned. By Marcus. At the House of Chthon. She's probably looking for me there. Please, please help me! I need to see my daughter. I... Sorry, sir. She came out of nowhere. Not a problem. Happens from time to time. Is she? Infected... Lane, this is Leon. I've got a stray in the lobby who needs an immediate transportation to disposal. Ma'am, if you'd like to accompany these gentlemen through that door, I'll see to it that you receive all the attention you deserve. I want my daughter, where is my daughter? Ma'am, we're gonna take care of you. I want my daughter. Agent Collins, Mr. Van Sciver will see you now. Will you follow me? Sure, thank you. My mom is in that ambulance, let's go! What can I do for the FBI? Well, I'm just following up on a case. What do you know about a young man named Zack Starr? That name isn't familiar. What about Krista Starr? - His wife? - Sister. I'm sorry, what is this about? Zack Starr was murdered and the case was being handled by a local detective, a cop named Brian Boone. Looks like Krista Starr was involved in the investigation. - Well, have you talked to her? - No, she's missing. You wouldn't know where I could find her by any chance, would you? - Do you say Boone? - Yeah. Is this the same detective who is being accused of this cross country killing spree? Yeah. And you're handling that case. Well, it might be tied to the Starr murder. You think it might be 2 murders, him and his sister? No. She isn't dead. In fact, her uncle saw her recently, just doesn't know how to get ahold of her. - You spoke to the uncle? - Uh-uh. And he tells me that you and Krista know each other pretty well. Tell me... - Do you understand british divorce courts, Mr. Collins? - Sorry. UK law, elementary requirements. Not at all. My situation is such that discretion in this case with this single young woman is both financially and publically essential. So you, you do know about Zack Starr? I'm afraid so. Yes. Only what Krista told me over the pillow, so to speak. How did you two meet? Social function. I was at a gallery opening, she walked in, and, I noticed. It happened like that. Did it? So can you tell me where she is now? No. I haven't seen her in a few days. And to be quite honest, she finds me, I don't have a number or an address, - just a willingness to see whenever she gets... - ...bitch. I tell you what. If you meet me at this park, I've got a meeting downtown, I'll... have some of my people dig her up for you. I'm sorry, poor choice of words, but I'm sure once I get them onto it. I'll be able to tell you exactly where she's been found. Now if there's nothing else, I think we're done here. There is one more thing, Mr. Van Sciver. Do you know what this symbol is? Should I? That wasn't my question. No. I don't know what it is. Do you? Not yet. Now we are done here. I apologize again. For what? Keeping me waiting or lying to me? Both. Good evening. Sabine will show you out. Picked the wrong House to crash, Ma'am. Chthon is pretty picky. I was looking for my daughter. She was there. A lot of people pass through them, Ma'am. What's that? An extract of garlic. I'd say this is gonna hurt a little but I'd be lying. I've always hated garlic. This will be the last time you'll be able to smell it. I promise. Oh my god, mom! What are you doing? Get out of the way. You're gonna have to kill me first, you son of a bitch. Blade. Krista? Mum, we're gonna get you out of here. I'm a little busy, sweetheart. Mom, look at me! You've to come with me now! Right now! What, what have you done to me? I'm gonna tell, I'll talk about that. Just... give me your hand. Come on. Come on. Alex. What are you doing here? Getting you out. Please? Here is a... cashier's check for 4 million dollars. It's what you need to get that property from Taylor. - And you want in on the deal? - No. I only want Chase. Alex, you do know that relationships between Pure Bloods and non Pure Bloods is frowned upon. To speak nothing of a... financial arrangement between Erebus ans the House of Chthon... Trust me. No one knows I'm here, this is strictly between you and me. So... take the money, buy whatever you want, but let Chase go. You're buying me. I'm rescuing you. There's a difference. Yes, there is. You're right. Since Berlin, I'm just not the same. Fine, go. Let me say goodbye properly. Pour us a drink, Chase. Let's toast to our new lifes. To endings and beginnings. Sorensen? - You're a long way from home, Ray. - Yes, so are you. But I'm not the one who's been ruffling feathers. Where did you hear that? I got a call from Director Hendricks who heard of a Michigan senator who was responding to a call from a local mover and shaker. Marcus Van Sciver. Is that the guy you've been accusing of killing people? I didn't accuse him of anything. But this has to do with that local cop that you've been chasing. Starts there, I don't know where it's gonna end. It's gonna end right here, Ray. Right here. It's time to fold up the tent, people are tired of the sideshow, Ray. You're asking for my gun? Do I have to ask? - Do you have a spare? - No. I'm gonna believe that. Is there something else? What? Van Sciver isn't human. Ok Ray, I've gonna get... No, you have to believe me, I've seen things. - I don't buy this... - No, listen to me! There's a conspiracy here. And it goes way back. I, I'm not sure who it involves, but these... these people, these things... Hey, I'm gonna make you promise, hey look at me, look at me in my eyes! We're gonna go home, you're gonna get to talk to... I'm not talking to another doctor! Talk to Hendricks. If you believe this, whatever it is, and I don't bring it forward in this day and age... I'm not willing take that risk. You've shitting me right? I've known you too long. Thank you. There's a flight at 7.30 am. - You got a hotel here, right? - Yeah. I'll pick you up first thing. We're gonna figure this out, Ray, you and me. We're gonna gat all this squared away. This ***. Where I am ? You are where you need to be, honey. You don't have to this, Chase. This is the only way to ensure the project success. What project? What are you talking about? What is he doing? Chase? It's ok. Don't worry about what he's doing. What is that? What is he doing? Marcus? Marcus? It's just an experiment. But one I'm sure will work. Ready. You're sure about this, Chase? I've nothing but faith in you. Chase? What's happening? Deep breaths. What are you doing? Giving you the chance to prove that Pure Bloods aren't immortal. Pure Bloods could die, and that we, the infected ones, will be the ones to take you all down. I... I... I thought you loved me. I do. For everything you've just done for Marcus and I. Who is infected now? I know it hurts, mom. - Please don't!!! - I can't. Stop it you bitch! It has to work right? Tell me it's gonna work! I'm so thristy! I can smell him, he's right there. I'm so thirsty, honey, please! Why isn't this working? She's fed to many times, she's been turned for too long. Let me out!!! What can I do? You can let me do it. Mom! Krista?
