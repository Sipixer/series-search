Bring me the girl. - You wanna break into Chthon? - Girl's on a knife's edge. If she falls off, I want her falling our way. - We're your family. - My family is dead! ... you're the only vampire who's ever felt pain? Who's ever suffered loss? - What I saw... you were? - Younger? Human. I'm here to reopen negociations. I want a piece of your action too. - Something's wrong with her. - Yeah, she looks drunk. No, something else. It hurts so much, being alone. Then you don't have to be Krista. Two beers. Good crowd tonight? Not if you're working on tips. You gotta take a day off. You've ever been to Detroit zoo? We should go sometime. They have lions. Alright. We're already in a zoo. Can I get a vodka and tonic? - Lime? - Yeah. 4 bucks. Hey? What are you doing off the floor? You're tired already? Thirsty. Zed? Watch and learn. Just don't forget to pay your tab this time. Come on, sexy! - It's Jennifer. - Yeah. You want to get out of here? Like leave? Yeah. This place is dead anyway. Hello? Can anybody hear me? Who is there? Who is that? Let me go! Leave me alone! All you want! Blade The Series - 110 - Hunters *** I don't know. You know? What am I gonna do? I can't ***. I didn't talk to her. You know. I'm sorry, Tom. Come on, give me a break! You know what? Come on! You're hunting? Me too. What... what are you doing? Cleaning you up. From what? You got too close to Marcus. What are you talking about? House of Chthon keeps their windows open at night. I took a peak. Screw you! Hmm, screw me. Come on Blade, look, I had to protect my cover. You're off the serum. You drank blood. Look, Blade... I'm done. I'm fine. Fine huh? Damn! If the detox doesn't work. Our partnership is done. And you're ash. What? That asshole forgot to pay his tab again. It's Zed, he will be back. Yeah, but he never tips when he forgets. Have some of mine. I had a good night. That's sweet but... it's ok. Maybe this snake's still here. Zed? Zed? Zed? Since when does a missing person involve vampires? They're the reason people go missing around here. You know that. She's probably already dead, or worse. You didn't give up when it was your sister. That was different. Before the Daywalker... you did it anyway. At least talk to the girl... or you can forget the free popcorn. I don't have time for this. I told you to wait. I know, I'm sorry. My name is Bethany. He  said that you could help me. Will you? I haven't spoken to her in 4 days. - You said your sister's name was Nicki? - Yeah. Let me guess. She's the wild sister? Not  really, no. Those are from work. She's a waitress at a club. It's some underground place. She's only been there for a few weeks. She was trying to get me to move downtown with her. She said that she missed me. I didn't know she ever missed me. But the police aren't doing anything. I don't have anyone else to go to. I'll look into it. Ok? Thank you. How did you get so big? Don't bother, Chase. He only likes to play with human girls. He has quite a collection. I'm sure. Relax, my dear. If I wanted you dead, Thorne would have already twisted your head off. You do know why you're here. I'm sure I don't, Charlotte. I've watched you for decades Chase. Most of the turned lacked the proper perspective. Their emotional turmoils from their human lives carry over into the next like phantom pains. It's a weakness. One the Pure Bloods thankfully don't share. Your anger from your human life stains this one, Chase. But somehow you've managed to use it as fuel. I know at your core it's because you are a survivor. - I had to be. - Yes. Ambitious. Thirsty for control. Willing to tear apart anything that threathens you. Anything. And I admire that. The truth is... You remind me of me when I was your age. And perhaps in 200 years, you'll understand why I do the things I do. Have you ever smelled something so sweet? Fresh blood taken from a newborn only hours old. Free from the sourness of life. Drink. Marcus Van Sciver is different than you and I Chase. He suffers from delusions of grandeur. He doesn't understand that the survival of our world depends on a hierarchy. I believe he's been planning something sinister against us for quite some time. I  don't know. Oh, but you do. I've brought you here to ask you one simple question Chase. Are you loyalties of Marcus... or Chthon? So what do we do if she gets out? If Krista breaks out before I let her out, you treat her like any other blood suckers. Dude! Van Sciver is ready to make his move against the Chthon Pure Bloods. I wanna make sure he succeeds. If Krista doesn't return to them, there can be delays. She could expose herself and us. Then everything we work towards goes up in flame. Man, she's had a rough few weeks. Ease up a little. I let her out, she's going straight for your throat. She's not your friend right now. She gets free, people will die! And part of our job is to keep people from dying. - Right? - What do you got? So what do you think? I don't see a face. I didn't either but, that's not what got my attention. Check this out. A glyph. I'm guessing, but it doesn't belong to any of the Twelve Houses. - No. - And it makes no sense. Unfortunately it does. There are a lot of unaffiliated vampires. Building their own little kingdoms. They don't want to belong to the Houses? Houses don't want them. Too uncontrolable. Like the White Prince. That's who this glyph belongs to? - Now, who is he? - Whistler mentionned him once or twice. I know the glyph and the name, but... that's about it. See what you can dig up. In the meantime, I gonna find his familiar. How are you gonna do that? Shake the right tree. This is *** god! You own this place? Dude, I own ten places. If you get marked, you get it. You want girls? You want a fistful of cash? You want *** for a while? Get it all. You sure you can get me in? Dude, I'm the king of familiars in this town. Your dad being a judge and all that? You got a use. You got a future. How many years you gotta put in? How much time for you're turned? See, that's the beautiful thing right there, Andy. Once you get bit by the bosses, time don't matter no more. Join up. Get marked. Get it all. Yeah! Oh shit. Oh yeah! Hey, hey, we're cool, you are not going to kill me, are you? Come back here, I will. Now you better get to a doctor. You're bleeding. Help me! Somebody help me! Go get some ice cream. This my club, it's under the protection of Chthon. King of familiars, uh? Well, I got a question for you. I'm looking for another familiar. Branded with this. Know him? Yeah, yeah, there was a guy. He was with the House of Erebus until he found a better gig. He became a personal to some solo vamp. He bragged about how he was on the fast track to immortality. What his asshole's name? Man  I can't remember, so many of these guys come and go! Where do I find him? Metal club called Trash. Wannabee spends all his time there. Thanks. Jesus Christ! Krista? Let me out. -  I can't. - No! It hurts. I know. No, you don't. Blade knows. Blade doesn't know anything! Krista, I know you can do this. You went to the Lychan blood ritual and you came back. I know you can handle this. You can beat the thirst. Krista? Help! Somebody help me, please!!! What are you doing? What are you doing to me? No! Please don't! How has she been? Quiet. Really? You think what she's doing is easy? I know it's not. Have you found that familiar? Getting there. Hangs at the same club the missing girl worked at. Learned anything more about this White Prince? More than I want to. Looks like our perp is a nomad. And he works on the metonic lunar cycle. Pops up once every 19 years. Have you ever heard of Gilles de Rais? Should I? He was a 15th century nobleman in France who had a taste for canibalism, sadism, and was probably a cat lover. His servants used to lure children back to his home where he tortured and mutilated them. When they caught him, he was found dancing in one of his victims entrails. Became known as the White Prince. And there have been other killers like him throughout history. Places where this glyph would show up. Garrett the Butcher, 16th century Germany. And the Red Rover Man in Seattle, early 1900s. And you think this is the same guy? Changing his M.O. along the way. Not entirely. It says that he disfigured his face by his own hands, So he somehow managed to permanently scar himself with silver. That's why he's gotta get familiars to lure his victims in. I found out where the new familiar likes to fish. So let's go find him and ask him where the Prince is building his castle? No. We have to do it quietly. Why? One wrong move from us and this guy is a shadow! Could disappear for another 19 years. Then how do we get this familiar to show us the way? Give him what his master wants. A girl. Who? The sister. You don't have to do this, Bethany. Who else is going to? We could find someone. And how long will that take? You should know your sister might not be alive. Yeah. You can only hope. Do you know who took my sister, Shen? Not really but, we know that he'll be going for another girl. So I'll be that girl. Alright. What's that? This has a transponder in it. - I can track you anywhere you are. - Ok. - I just need to attach you. - Ok. Here. - Yeah. Yeah. - It's ok. Just... You can clip it on. We won't let anything happen to you, Bethany. We? Wow. Don't freak. Freak? No, I... Are you kidding? I mean, he... looks like he could take anything on. And, that's good, right? Open your eyes. Open them. Do you know what I am? I know what you are. You're a child of God. You're corrupted by your sins. I was too. But I died. And rose again. Royalty reborn as a seraphim. A by-product of humans and angels. I will forever walk on earth drowning in your blood to behold the glory. Your insides hold the doorway to the bite. If only for the briefest of moment. You don't believe I'm what I say I am, do you? You're like the others, you need to see. I am chosen. I am holy. Do you have her in sight, Shen? I see her. She's cute. What? - That chick, she's cute. - Yeah. Can I get you a drink? Coke. And? Just a coke. Sure. Blade? I don't like this. You don't think I'd rather be in there cracking skulls open? I  show my face, the White Prince disappear. Look, there's only one way get in and out this place. And I'm watching it. Still, using a desperate girl as a piece of cheese. It's the only move, Shen. What about her sister? You don't think she's still alive, do you? No. Do you even hope she is? Do you care? You do that for me. You're new here? You're looking for someone? Cause if not, I'd like to buy you a drink. - Shit! - What? Actually, I... I am here with someone. Must be a real lucky guy. Why don't you tell me how I can get that lucky. Please, stop, stop, stop, please! Blade? He's making a move for her. Stick to the plan! New plan! Hey! Where is she, you prick? Who? Shen? You know who. Her sister. The girl you picked up the other night. You alright? Come on! Show me the glyph. What? I don't know what you're talking about! I'm sorry, alright man. I didn't know she was with you. Bethany? Bethany? Blade? - She didn't come out. - But, she had to. She's not in. Shit! The virus will be ready for transport in 3 days, sir. Thank you. Marcus. Chase. I've been looking for Krista. Have you seen her? No. Where have you been? At a tea party. I know you can handle this. You can beat the thirst. I don't feel very well. Our partnership is done. And you're ash. And you're ash. We're doing a good thing. We could't have done it without you. You can beat the thirst. Hmm, Krista. Don't forget to drink. You shouldn't have gone to Charlotte's. I didn't have a choice. What else did you tell her? Our little girl did most of the talking. But did you tell her anything? Nothing she didn't already know. She wants a pair of eyes and ears inside your operations. Mine. And your answer? I told Goldy Locks I needed to think about it. Go back to her. Tell her you made up your mind. And you'd like to prove it. I know! I didn't say anything. I made a mistake. I'm gonna get cleaned up. Holy shit! Shen? What? The transponder is moving. She's still in there. Just looked! I didn't see her. There's gotta be another way out. Is there a basement? I don't know. Yeah, I bet there is. You bet there is what? Where did you take her? I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you goddamn well know who. You're that sick bastard's delivery boy. Shen? Blade. I got him. Shen? Son of a bitch. He's leading me to the glory, to divinity. Where is she? He's been transformed. And one day I will be... into perfection. Go, go ***. Come on! You're his familiar, aren't you? We heard you talk to him. Say his name... Blade! Tell me. After all the work you do for him. What's he gonna do for you.? Fuck you. Please, don't! I'm sorry. If I'd known you worked for Blade, I... Shen, find the girl. What a pretty smile. And I'm gonna rip yours off. You're gonna be alright. You're gonna be alright. He said he wanted a hundred people. One hundred people and I'd get to live forever. You're not going anywhere. Yes, we are. Now living forever? I got you! It's just not you! You're a hunter. Like me. I'm nothing like you. But you are. You enjoy it. Enjoy what? Killing, pain, torture. You think you're special? Some kind of god? I am a seraphim! A prince appointed by a power much higher than us. You're nothing but an another crazy ass vampire. Blasphemy! You were sent by the devil to challenge my faith. To close the doorway to the heavens. You talk too much. What's the matter, asshole? Not smiling anymore? You know, I think I see the light. I got you, ok? Everything is gonna be alright now. I still don't understand everything that happened. Take care of yourself. Thorne, we're going home. Call the jet. I wanna be in the air within the hour. The board will be very interested to hear this. I'm sure they will. You've done well, Chase. It's only the beginning of what I can do for you. A present. How nice. The Daywalker's? A promise. Marcus now, Blade next. Our relationship is paying off already. Shit! What do want me to say? That you were right? You don't have to say anything. I lost everyone, mmh... everything. Addicts never handle loss very well. And that's what you are. An addict. But you have a choice. Keep going or not. Does it ever getting better? Every time I kill a vampire. Marcus is making his move against the Chthon Pure Bloods soon. I need to know where it's gonna be. He's not gonna tell me. Get him to trust you. And he will. Yeah. Do you trust her? Next time on Blade. Do you know a Pure Blood named Charlotte? One of Chthon's heavy hitters. Marcus snuck a bomb into her jet, blew out of the sky about an hour ago. This ain't nothing you wanna get involved in. - Just get the hell out of here. - I'm staying. We gotta find that plane.
