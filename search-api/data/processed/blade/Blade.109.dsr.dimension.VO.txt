forever if you want. What are you doing?! - She turned her mother. - That's what it looks like. Boone is dead. - Domic learnt nothing from him. - He knows! Charlotte! Domic! Armaya is back in the fold by Friday. Or Chthon will be destroyed. Silver, mirrors are backed with it. What is this? Sex trade, illegal body parts, I've never seen this before. Van Sciver isn't human. - I've gonna get... - No, you have to believe me, I've seen things. - I don't buy this... - No, listen to me! And what are you? You're just... infected. You're nothing but pieces of meat that got a reprieve. Chase, what are you doing? Giving you the chance to prove that Pure Bloods aren't immortal. Pure Bloods could die, and that we, the infected ones, will be the ones to take you all down. Who is infected now? I'm so thirsty, honey! She's fed to many times, she's been turned for too long. Mom! Krista? I'm sorry. Slow down, sweetheart. Then again, everyone who loved you is dead. And it's all your fault. I need another one. Beautiful women... should never have to buy their own drinks. Thanks. I'm Lance by the way. You see, this is where you supposed to say who you are. Someone you don't wanna know. Why? Do you bite? So mystery girl, are you... here to forget a bad day or are you looking to have a good night? Just trying to have a drink. Alone. In a place like this? Let me get you another one. Bartender? Whatever she's having, we'll have the bottle. Lance? Go away. Look, VIP room upstairs guy *** You and I will go out and we chill, and uh... You can use some warmed up, you're ice cold honey. I can get a lot colder. You're a crazy bitch, you know that? Yeah, I know. Blade The Series - 109 - Angels and Demons You look like a little boy, Waiting to open presents on Christmas morning. These are exciting times, Chase. So the final *** is confirmed? Overwhelmingly. All that's left is replication the pathogen and of generalization for delivery. That, and you enjoy the last look on their faces. I hate to ruin your day, but you remember a few nights ago when that woman stormed the lobby then killed our disposal team? One Lisa Starr. Tell me you're joking. Crazed, out of control, like mother, like daughter. Where is Krista? We are about to achieve something magnificient here. Transform Chthon into something new, something better. Maybe it's time we thin our ranks, clear out the underbrush. Locate Krista and collect her, safely. Once the Pure Bloods are gone, the last thing we need is a problem like Krista. Chase! Find her! This is where you guys work? I gotta say, it looks better over a computer. Ever heard of a lamp, maybe a couple of throw pillows? - Did you bring 'em? - Yeah. The Aurora vaccine I just needed in half, and, a little bit less of the stuff that came out of the girl. Final results are right here. So Marcus is making a... Pure Blood poison? It's biological masterpiece. The Aurora vaccine was just a start. The emerging agent is a DNA-based weapon specifically engineered to attack the Pure Blood genom. It's one nasty bug. Why use a pregnant woman? A womb is the perfect nutrient rich incubator. It also ensures biological immunity for anyone other than the intended target. So it's armless against us. It only kills Pure Bloods. So that sneaky bastard wasn't even trying to create a vampire immunity. He was playing a palace coup. Dude, crack a smile. If Marcus takes out the Pure Blood trash, we don't have to. Maybe. All he needs to do is get the Pure Bloods together in one place. Sounds like a party. You think Krista got an invitation? Find her, and I'll ask. I'm trying. Blurried all eyes in the street but no one's seen her shadow. Jus get it done. No, really Blade. You don't have to thank me. Welcome to my nightmare. Get off of me! Please, I... said no! *** Is that the only word you bitches can say! "No"? Please! I said no! You... leave! You... die! Krista. We've been looking for you, darling. It's time to go home. Excuse-me sir. What? Armaya's reinstatement has just become official. The leaders of all the factions are sending very generous gifts. Send them back. Sir? Screw them all. We're going to clean this House. Once I'm done with the House of Chthon. I thought that we were. We haven't even started. Call Van Sciver. Tell him that we're stopping by for a little visit. Domic, with all your respect, it's not wise. It's necessary. Charlotte and her lap dog Marcus have been living the good lives for years. Forcing us to live of of tables craps. But Chthon has already provided you with everything you've demanded. Then it's time to demand more. - Let go of me. - Look what I've found. Where have you been? In a filthy alley, rummaging for a midnight snack. I've been worried about you Krista. You know, well, worry is your middle name, ain't it? You've been drinking. Obviously not enough. You know, bitterness isn't the most attractive emotion. What am I supposed to feel Marcus, mmh? Gratitude? It would be a start. No, the start was when you killed my brother. I told you before. I didn't mean to kill Zack. Don't you even say his name! You need to accept you brother's fate, the same you need to accept your own. What, by living here? With you animals? We're your family. My family is dead! All I ever loved, everything I ever was is gone! Replaced by a life even better. Life? All you've given me is one long night of nothing! Then you simply haven't opened your eyes. Oh they are opened, and every day they look at you and see the bastard that killed me. You think you're the only one. You think you're the only vampire who's ever felt pain? Who's ever suffered loss? Help me!!! Get her to her room. Clean her off. Sir? He just called. - He? - Domic, he'll be here tomorrow night. Shen? Haven't found Krista yet. So what are you doing about it? I told you. Put the word out. What do you want me to do? Tack up flyers around the neighborhood? Lost vampire. Last scene : ashing her own mother. Maybe suicidal, homicidal or both. Needs her meds. We have to find out where Marcus is going to poison the Pure Bloods. And Krista will tell us, just relax! Give the girl some time. It's weird, isn't it? What? That I haven't taken your head off yet? No, you and Marcus, on the same side, gunning for the Pure Bloods. I guess the ennemy of my ennemy is my friend. Well, I don't have a problem of killing my friends either. Oh, bingo. What? One of those streets punks that hangs out downtown. He just saw Krista get scooped outside a club before daybreak. - Hot ride, hotter blonde. - Chase. At least our girl's still alive. So to speak. Grab your shit. We're going to Chthon. What do you want? I need to know that you're better. Uh, you mean no longer a threat. If I thought you really meant the things you said and did in my office then Chase would be disposing an ash stained carpet right about now. Then why am I tied up? Because you are a threat to yourself. Screw you! Krista? Krista? Do you really think you're alone? Everyone I had is gone. Everyone you thought you had. The ones whose memories are fading even now no matter how hard you try to hold on to them. What are those people to you really? Acquaintances come and go, friends... lose touch. - You move on, they move on. - But my family? Accident of birth. No more intentional than the color of your eyes. But you and I... we're connected. My life is in you. Flows through you. You know this. A.D.E... Every vampire shares an eternal link with the one who turned them. That's the gift of the after death experience. Who I am, who I was, now lives in your blood. Your mind, is the only bone that can't be broken by hate or hurt or even time. So if you want to kill me, fine. Just know that you can't kill the part of me that will live inside of you... forever. Marcus, where are you taking me? Your eyes are closed? Ok, nearly there. - Are they still closed? - Yes. Ok. - Ready? - I'm ready. - But you're really ready? - Marcus! Ok, open. Oh, it's beautiful. It's ***. It's, it's apauling. No, it's ours. It's yours and mine. We can start with dry goods, and then fresh produce and flowers. Let's start by removing the rog*** first, shall we? Didn't I tell you coming here would change everything? Your father can't stop us now. We're oceans away, and we can do whatever we choose. So, we can buy a house? As soon as you find one. Start a family? Maybe even sooner than that. Whatever I am, Isabelle, whatever kind of man I become, it's all because of you. No, it's all been taken care of. He's here. See you when we land. Hey Ray, are you ready? You keep your word and get me that meeting with Hendricks. That was the director's office on the horn Said they'll have a car waiting for us. Let's go. I'm proud at you, Ray. Coming in is the right thing to do. Oh, what are you doing, buddy? Thanking God that I didn't give you my back up yesterday. Come one Ray, don't do anything crazy. Come on! I saw the mark. I know! So what, you're gonna start running like there's some place to hide from them? You tell me, you work for them! What you gonna do, shoot me, now? Here in the street? Come on! Shoot me. Come on! Shoot me, Ray. Isabelle? Yes. She is beautiful. In every way. And you were? Younger? Human. What I saw, you and Isabelle, was that before you were turned? You already know. Marcus? Marcus? Take a break, I'll bring you dinner. Isabelle. Don't have time. We open in 2 days. Oh, 5 minutes won't kill you. Hum, I'm sorry gentlemen, but we don't actually open until the day after tomorrow. Evening, friend. That's some venture you're undertaking. Ambitious. Thank you. - Uh, mister? - Domic. And let me guess you are not from Detroit. London. Disgusting city. *** the smell of myself. What can I do for you Mr. Domic? Actually, it's... what I could do for you. I'm not sure I follow. You're surely noticed ours is a growing city. Each day more enterprises are commenced, more people arrive. Unfortunately not all newcomers are honest in these industries such as yourself. Rebels who don't know how to comport themselves like gentlemen. I understand, and you would like to protect me from such rebel. All that is due me is a small sum paid weekly. For that, my associates and I will provide a bull work against the unsafe tides raising in our fair streets. That's very generous, Mr. Domic, but uh, I believe I'll decline your offer. Offer? I don't recall making one. Marcus? It's all right, dear. It's just our neighbors ***. We should be opening properly in the next few days. Yes. We'll be back then, to finalize our arrangement. Untill then Madam, just tell your husband to secure the front doors. Detroit is a lovely city but it has his ugly elements. I heard his demands. Then you heard my refusal. - Marcus, I don't think a man like... - Isabelle! He's gone. It's all right. Now, how about that dinner that smells so good. You're shitting me? You wanna break into Chthon? Girl's on a knife's edge. If she falls off, I wanna her falling our way. So you can catch her right? Right? That's our way in. The sewer? Lovely. It's how Krista got to their labs. And got caught. We'll do it quieter. I'll grab my tools. And I'll grab mine. How is sleeping beauty? She's still sleeping. You've been terribly indulgent with her. We all make allowances with those who share birth experience. You and Frederick for example. I'd like to kill him. And yet, you never have. I hear Domic's on his way. In a few hours. What are you going to do? Remind him who he's dealing with. So shop keep, our arrangement? I told you, there'll be none. It would be wise to reconsider. You'd be wise to leave my store. Better do as he says, fellows. Man's armed with the push ***. You'll get nothing from me Domic, nothing! We'll see, shop keep. We'll see. And I thought vampires were the most disgusting things in this place. Well, Krista said the pipe leading to the med lab is around this corner. Van Sciver bricked it up. So this enjoyable little *** has gotten squat.. - We can get through this. - No, no, no, wait! Shock sensors. Any unordinary vibration and the cavalery comes running. Well, we have to find the way to know what's going on with Krista. Think we just did. Still no word from Gonesse? Then we must assume they never will be. At least, it confirms our suspicions. Marcus and his newest recruit cannot be trusted. Which means we will accelerate our plans. Bring me the girl. *** the *** of the security camera. Oh, if I don't fry myself first. Got it. Now, this trunk supports the IT system PBX, phones, data and alpha can just isolate the security feed. And, pop an uplink, who can tune in to BSTV. BSTV? Blood Sucker Television, 24-hour Chthon network, all vamps, all the time! Tough room. You think it's vampire or familiars? Either way, they die. Keep working. Control? Have a possible breach in tunnel 12, checking it out now. You? What you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Getting a manucure? Someone called city about an IT line that got chewed through. This is motorisation. Toolbox, right there. You got some real problems, pal. Real scary shit. What? Like rats? No. Daywalkers. Done. So was he. Sleep my angel. Marcus! You had your chance to pay. No! Now she will! No, Isabelle! No! What kind of a monster are you? A monster? I am something far greater. Something you'll come to understand. I'd be rather choose death. Death just chose you, shop keep. Isabelle? Marcus? Where are you taking me? Blade. I'm online. So where is she? There! Something's wrong with her. Yeah, she looks drunk. No, something else. Wait! Help. Help me. Agent Collins? I'm sorry, I had nowhere else to go. - Come in, please. - Thanks. Was Sorensen alive? I don't know. I think so. - But you don't know... - He was trying to kill me, I didn't check his pulse. I just have to stay alive long enough to expose these things for what they are and the people who helped them. Bastards like Sorensen. You must think I'm out of my mind. Then we both are. If you'd shown up at my door step in the middle of the night a month ago talking about vampires. Governments in collusion. I probably would have called the cops. What changed? Everything. What's this? Proof that you're not crazy and neither am I. Believe me, I started to feel pretty nuts trying to figure out what happened that night at the truck store. The butcher truck? Yeah, fire, the body pallets. It all just got too weird. So I called in a favor at central. A friend of mine gave me all the files of every case over the last 10 years with even the slightest similarity. And? And I found stuff. Strange deaths. Corpses with bite wounds. Evidence of... events describing spontaneous combustion. So what are the people to be ***? Whoever does is trying to burry him. Right after I xeroxed all these and got the originals back to my friend at central. He disappeared. His job, his appartment, every trace of him is gone. They got him. Somebody did. So there's no one who can help us? There might be one. He uh, he goes with the name of Blade. The guy is in profiling peg him as psychopath with psyzophrenic deviations. Blade on the other hand reffers to himself as a hunter. Who is he hunting? Not who, what. Is he custody? He escaped. Last seen in Detroit. Van Sciver. Domic. I'm surprised you allowed me in. Is that why you brought help? Puzic, wait downstairs. - Sir, I don't... - Wait downstairs. So, this is where it all happens uh? The heights from which the mighty Marcus Van Sciver makes the world do his bidding. It's good furniture, Domic. Please, suppress the urge to urinate on it. I just thought for the self proclaimed leaders of the vampire nation, the House of Chthon would be a little more... upscale. Get to the point. Do I need one? Can't I just visit? We are partners now right? Under protest. Oh yeah, that's right, you didn't want Charlotte cutting me in on your little experiments, did you? Even after I found out it was my people you were cutting up to make it happen. The House of Armaya will receive priority access when the Aurora vaccine is ready. The negociations for this arrangement have been concluded. So there really is nothing left for us to discuss. That's just it. I'm here to reopen negociations. I want a piece of your action too. Precisely what action would that be? All of it. Real estate developments, currency speculation. My House has been living out of *** for centuries. So I want a slice of every pie you got your fingers in. I'm afraid, you've made your trip in vain. You'll receive nothing more from me. Or my House. Do I have to remind you of your place in the world, Van Sciver? I am a Pure Blood. I can take whatever I want from you and there's not a goddamn thing you could say about it. You know what Domic, there was a time when it was indeed true. You did take everything I had. What are you talking about? A hundred years ago. My wife Isabelle. I swallowed my grief. Biding my time. A century's worth. And now it's here. The moment where I... take from you. Screw you! And screw Isabelle! Marcus? Do you know how many men I killed over the years? How many women I've taken? Why are you laughing? You, all this time, burning with revenge for me. I don't even remember you of whoever you say that whore was you say I killed. I don't remember. I don't remember. I do! Marcus? I'm fine! I'll alert medical. I said I'm fine Chase! Domic's man. He's downstairs. On my way. Marcus, I saw what happen to Isabelle. To you. It's only what happens to all our kind. Like you and your mother. It hurts so much, being alone. Then you don't have to be Krista... ever. Where is Domic? Hell. Care to join him? Wait, wait, here she is. - Who is she with? Is that... - Yeah. So where are they going? It just got worse. They're onto us, They're trying to find our taps. Not yet. Damn it! Hey?
