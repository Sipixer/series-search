last 36 hours? I didn't know you were counting. Your absence is always apparent. Really? When you're gone, I hardly even notice. All I'm saying Krista is that you were missed. So you and I spend a night together and now I'm on your leash. Of course not. I was just concerned. Don't be. About Charlotte. What about her? She intercepted Chase. Tried to corrupt her. And? Chase loyalties are with us, as they will always be. Why would Charlotte make a play now? Do you think she knows? About my plans against them? It doesn't matter. Since when? Since right about... this very moment. Do you think this will be our world forever? Or we will one day walk in daylight like Marcus promises? For once, I'm at a loss to know. So many changes occurring. This Marcus business. The Conclave approaching. Yes, and Gonnesse. Still part of me has hope. Odd isn't it? Perhaps, it's knowing that Chase is now on our side. Or perhaps it's the prize she's promised us. Didn't I say it'd be awesome up here. You didn't say it'd this cold. Small price to pay. Hearing all this. I don't hear anything. Exactly, no cars, no cell phones, no corporate sheep babbling their corporate bullshit. Just you and me... Holy shit!!! Call 911! We don't have cell phone! Maybe someone made it. Come on! Blade The Series - 111 - Monsters Any luck? Another dead end. With a dead vampire I'm guessing. Only thing I made ***. You get that list done yet? It'd be easier finding places Marcus didn't own property. Dude got buildings worldwide. I mean I find 90 so far 22 in North America alone. We only need to find one. Where he's gonna mask to Chthon Pure Bloods. So you can go watch? So I can join the party. We're gonna getting close uh? The big brass ring. We'll be getting a big brass dick if we don't find out where it’s going down. Any word on Krista? Not a peep since she went back to Chthon. You think she’s getting hell for being AWOL too long? All Chthon all you get is hell. What's that? Company. Probably just a homeless guy looking for a place to crash. That's a gun, not a pillow. Let's go wish him good night. You, get up! Ok. Easy, put your hands above you head. Turn around slowly. Were you Eric Brook... Wait a minute, you're not Blade! And you're not that smart! Oh... my god! Who was that? Scott, no one... would survive this. I  don't think I wanna be here anymore. - Elise stay put, I'll be right back. - No! Jesus! Honey, are you, are you... are you ok? I will be in a moment. Scott? Scott? Enjoy your nap? He won't wake up for the next one. Hey, easy guys, I'm uh, I'm just someone looking for a few answers. Just someone? Alright I'm a Fed. Ok, that hurt. I hate Feds. Yeah he does. They anger him. Now start talking. Kind of a long story. You ain't going nowhere. So  Charlotte is dead? As Cesar. And only a hundred years too late. - And a Pure Blood believe you. - Unanimously. I've been filling cause all day. It's a horrible loss. A painful day for the vampire nation. And just what I told them it was. A tragic accident. Though, I may have planted the tinyest seed. Could have been an act of retaliation from the House of Armaya. Marcus? Be careful. - If the board suspects even the slightest thing. - Please. Compared to convincing Charlotte I was a loyal servant all these years, making those idiots think that I'm consumed with grief will be walking in a park. So the Conclave is proceeding. They're insisting upon it. Said the delivery of Aurora would have been Charlotte's wish. A tribute to her enduring legacy in the House of Chthon. My  only regret? It's that I didn't get to watch the little bitch die in the same excruciating manner they all will. So Toronto? What job do I get? The best one. Unleashing it. Probably more condoleances now. Van Sciver. No. No, don't put him on the phone. I wanna to hear his explanation in person in my office first thing tomorrow. Problem? Renovation on the Conclave site is falling behind. Bringing the architect here for a little come to Jesus! Should I join the party? You know how much I enjoy helping people meet our Lord. No you stay here. Keep us on schedule. Krista'll help me. Marcus, not her! You have your job Chase, so do it. Your people at the FBI know you find me? Actually. I haven't uh, kept them up to speed in my investigation. - I don't think they'd understand. - Good. Now do everybody a favor, and leave. Leave? This ain't nothing you wanna get involved in. You got a ring on your finger. Go back to your family wherever they are. - Just get the hell out of here. - I'm staying. Not if you plan on living. Hey listen to me! I'm not some asshole off the street. I'm a Federal agent! We can work together. Take down Van Sciver. - Nobody is bringing him down. - He's a goddamn killer. I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it. But right now his goals are my goals. Enemy of my enemy and all that... Fine, so when you're done with that, then we take him down. We? There's no we. There's me and there's vampires. I kill 'em and they die. Only way it works. You want me stopped? Stop me. Not a problem. Another incoming. Payphone... 22nd & Adams. Gotta be her. And? I'll kill him in a second. Just answer it. - Krista? - Yeah, it's me. Tell me you've found out where the Conclave is at. Sorry, but Marcus has already started the blood bath. Do you know a Pure Blood named Charlotte? - One of Chthon's heavy hitters. - Well not anymore. Marcus snuck a bomb into her jet, blew out of the sky about an hour ago. Hey, one hunter down, five to go. Where was Charlotte's plane when he took her down? Somewhere over north of Michigan. Hey, listen, I gotta get back. Just thought you guys should know. We gotta find that plane. Blade those vamps ashed long before they hit the ground. I'm not looking for them. Just what they had. Pure Bloods live like ghosts. Secret lives, always on the move. Which means all the information travels with them. Maybe even edges to the Conclave. If it didn't burn up. We find the wreckage and we find out. - So get on it. - Ok, but finding a down plane in the middle of nowhere could take a couple of hours, maybe a couple of days. I'm not exactly the FAA. You don't need the FAA, just the FBI. Bureau has access to Napster 3.0 for flights. Domestic surveillance imaging. So do it. We need the information. We? - I... I thought there was no we. - Let me guess, unless you're involved. Where you go I go. Forget it. And good luck finding that plane! Hey Collins, he barely lets me going anywhere with him and this time I'm going. Dude. He's staying here. Track the Conclave for ***. - You said we've find it out there. - I said maybe. It could turn out just to be another dead end. Great! So it's back printouts and push pens and hey! Even before I do that, I gotta pull a missing jet out of my ass! Wasting time doing that too. Answer might just be a few clicks away. Okay, Collins. Find the goddamn plane. Alright. Sir? You wanted to see me? Don't I always? Yeah. Sometimes so much you come to my room unasked. Not to be confused with those times you invite me in. Let me say again. I invaded your privacy and I apologize. Accepted. Now, about me invading your privacy. Well that was simply something that happened. Exactly. Not to say it was meaningless. - I didn't... - Good, because I would hate to exclude you from the number of things recently that have given me great pleasure. - Like? - Like, you coming to a better understanding of who I am. And me getting to collect on a debt long owned me by Domic. Hallucinations and murder. I'm almost touched the game with me ranks so highly. You know what I mean. So what's on the menu for today? Well, despite Charlotte's tragic demise, the leaders of our House have agreed that Aurora should be delivered as planned. Right now they're preparing to join into the Conclave from points around the world. Unfortunately though, the building's restauration is falling behind schedule. I have summoned my architect. I was hoping that you and I could impress upon him the importance of meeting our deadline. I'm sure we can. And it shouldn't take long for me to get up to speed either. That... would be a terrible mistake. You don't trust me? I think that you and I can spend the next half-an-hour more productively. You didn't answer my question. I only trust those I know. So this would be you getting to know me better? Like I said, you've  got under my skin. And allow me the same pleasure. Holy shit! Come on! So what exactly are we looking for? Paper work, laptops, any kind of information. Hey Blade? Did you find any bodies? I'm not expecting to. Charlotte's people would have all been vampires. Vampires ash. We have a pretty good hole here. Take it back and comb through it. Not just yet. What is it? Blood. Jesus! - What are you, a vampire? - Half. Still happy you came along? Ok... Collins, over here! Jesus! I guess there was a human aboard. Look at their necks. There were fed on. Somebody in that plane survived. How is that possible? Doesn't  matter. Only thing that matters is finding 'em and killing 'em. Faster, it will be light soon. Put me down. Finally, refuge. Another meal as well. So what uh, what language is this? Serdic, vampire mother tongue. - You can read it? - Shen can. The other guy who is working for you. Not working, an arrangement. He's been looking for a couple of vampires for years. And then you kill them? Just find them. Shen gets the honors. What about the girl who called? Krista? What about we see how long you can walk without asking me a question? Sorry. Investigating is the job. Was. You got fired from the FBI. On the computer. You tipped in the name Jessica Ellis. So, - unless you had some kind of an operation. - No. No. I got fired. I found out my bosses were working for Van Sciver as well as the Bureau. He had some kind of a... - a tatoo on his wrist like a... - Glyph. Your bosses are familiars. That's what you call 'em, familiars? I call 'em targets. Blade you and I are more like than you think. We both kill monsters. What do you know about monsters? More than I'd like, year and a half ago. I arrested to a spree killer, he just liked murdering people. Tracked  him down, made a case, locked him up. His lawyer found a problem with the warrant. Got him sprung. While he was awaiting his trial, he took the opportunity to uh, break into my house. He murdered my wife and child. Sara and Johanna. I made sure he didn't make it to the second trial. Franck? You are on pancakes. Ok, when those doors open, I want big smiles, people, big smiles. Knock it off before I start cracking heads. I'm going to the back to get more of *** sugar. Let's go come on! It's good. Good Lord! Are you alright? Sir, can I help you? Sir, can you hear me? Nice place. Look quiet though. Like a crypt. Where do you want to start? Where they did. Jesus! I've seen some things but... Closer you'll get to Charlotte, the worse you're gonna see. You think she's still here? It's light out. Nowhere else for her to go. - Now let's get busy! - Hey wait no! They'll rise again. - Exactly why she turned them. - They're people! Not anymore! That's why we send 'em to their graves now. Hey, maybe someone is still alive, come on! No, Collins! Dumbass! Ok I got this! Collins. Ready? It's a trap. It's a school. It could be a kid. You gotta be kidding me! Come on. This is outrageous. Marcus is pissed because we're behind, so he makes me drop everything and come all the way here just to keep me waiting! Is there a problem Tucker? Yes there is, your boss. Who is he in with, Sabine? Sorry for the delay, please come in. - I already told you that... - No one shuts me out. How bad is it? Bad. Femoral artery. Alright, I'm not leaving. You will when I'll put your ass out into the street. Blade, half the town is in here, ready to rise. You told me yourself. Do you ever leave when someone tells you to? Look, you just go find Charlotte and I'll take care of the rest of 'em. How? By being the bait. I understand why you want to retina scanners on the entrance. I just don't get why the entire ventilation system needs refitting. Because I requested it. But the one in there is fine! The compressors are 78/50, the ACH for the *** fine. Which is way more than enough. My guests are irreclusive. I know who your guests are. I'm busting my ass for accomodating their long lists of security needs. As well as yours. The location for the Conclave site is very highly guarded secret. I get that! You just need to understand this is a very old building. Beautiful but old. Which means the preparation... Mr. Marfit, this is not a negociation. - Who is she? - My associate. Well, tell your associate I do not respond to threats. What do you respond to, Tucker? Excuse me? Is it more money? Because I'm suddendly getting the distinct impression I'm being widdeled. You know what Marcus? You don't like I'm doing this job? Do it yourself. You said what? You've heard me. I'm hoping I didn't. Or what? You'll fire me, kill me? This close to your big party. And even if you did, you'll never find someone half as good as me. There are buildings all over the world that attest of the fact that we are a hell of a team. But you must remember that you're not the only one under a hell of lot of pressure on this job! And even though, I may be just a familiar but I believe I've earned the right to not be treated like a goddamn shoe-shine boy. You know, Tucker, you're right. I'm not going to fire you. And I'm certainly not gonna waste your considerable talent by killing you. In fact, I'll make you a promise. Money is as no object, while this project is concerned. We'll supply you with every additional ressource. Tools, man power, anything you require. Thank you. And if even then, though you get everything you've asked for, the location is not completely ready for the Conclave, I promise I will render every one you ever loved... just like this! You may not be replacible, but every one around you... is. Sabine! See, you already have a new assistant. Don't worry, Mr. Marfit, I'll be right behind you every step away. Now Tucker, do us all a favor. Go back and finish your job. Thank you. Dispose of that. Krista! I'll do it, as I always have. Yes Chase, as you always have. You're sure about this? It's better than leaving huh? And if it doesn't work. Then you do me a favor. - And you make sure... - Trust me, you won't. No, I'm safe where I am for the moment. Send no one until dusk. Make no other moves. I want Marcus to enjoy his little illusion of victory. Till it's time for him not to enjoy it. I'll sleep untill dark. Then we're gone. Ok. Come on, you bastards! That's right. Fresh human blood. Everybody gets a taste, come on! God, I hope this works. What was that? Time is up, Pure Blood. Charlotte? Hey, Lurch. Freeze. Please don't hurt me. Those things out there. We were helping out with pancakes. They got my daddy. I ran in here to hide. No. No, you're the... the Pure Blood. I just wanna find my daddy. And make everything ok. Alright, honey. I'll help you find your daddy. I wanna hear you scream. Scream!!! Can you hear me now??? Collins. Blade? Blade! So good to finally meet you. Wish I could say the same. Come now. No respect for long time fellow? Not even a little. Well, I have respect for you. That's why hope you'll entertain my offer. You're in a position to offer anything? I'll admit, recent events haven't quite gone as I would have liked. But now it's clear. You and I share a common ennemy. Marcus. I might even be able to broker you a deal between you and the Twelve Houses. Allow me to get to the Conclave and I'll secure you a place in the family. You're half of what we are Blade. I wouldn't even claim that much keenship with a traitor like Marcus. Think about it. A chance to have a home. To lay down your arms. We could put your skills to their best use. Help your many talents flower like never before. You know Charlotte, that does sound pretty good. But this is my only talent. Nice. Collins, don't worry. I'm getting you out of here. No, it's too late. But, thanks for letting me do it. Do what? Kill a few monsters. Now it's your turn. Collins, listen you don't... No, no, you promised. Oh Marcus, no. Yes. It was hers. Long ago, too long. Doesn't anyone knock in this place? I knocked, you didn't answer. I was in the shower. For a very long time. What do you want Chase? Only to let you know that I understand. Understand? What he sees in you. Your beauty. Your youth. Even a man trully dead cannot help but notice. I only wish he could see what I see. Which is? Nothing. I look at you Krista, and I see absolutely nothing. Oh, maybe not nothing. I suppose I do see a hollow little girl playing hollow little games. The only thing about you of any substance, any real value, is this. And it isn't even yours. It is now. At least you've finally found the grace to accept one of the many gifts - you've been offered. - Such as? The gift of this House. The gift of friendship I've continually extended to you. The gift of healing. Is that what this visit is about Chase? Healing? Or do you just want your man back? That's entirely up to you. But I'd hate to think that in the next few days when so much change is happening to the House. You didn't have me as your friend. Because I know you don't want me as your enemy. Can I get back to you on that? Of course. Let's just hope time doesn't run out before you do! Tic toc. Next time on the season finale of Blade. You gotta get out, Marcus' people are coming for you. Give it up, Daywalker! What are you doing? Toying with you. My final performance. Where is the new place? Waiting your touch. I come bearing a magnificient gift. The gift of a new dawn
