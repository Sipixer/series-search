Next stop? Hell. Dispatch, I need an ambulance ASAP. It's a little late for that, sweetheart. Kill everything. Burn it to the ground. Krista! Kill Fritz! Do it now! Deep breath, sweety. This might sting. I think we woke the neighbors. Screw them. I've got a better idea. What's the problem, asshole? Ready to answer my question? I didn't know you asked one. If you weren't running, you would have heard it. Wow! Okay! Okay! Ask me the question. Sands. A vampire. You know him? No. Yeah! Yeah, Sands. I know him. I was his personal familiar for a while. Quick is the perk with shit. How do I find him? Man, how the hell would I know? Shit! Goddamn it! The guy's got a habit. Gambling. - He hangs out in casinos? - Huh-uh. He got a favorite one? I don't know, man, something shitty. Something with bad lighting, he doesn't like to be looked at. He got pretty messed up a while back. What? That's it? Bonus question. Great. You pissed off the House of Chthon. Do you know how? Yeah, I ashed a heavy hitter. Winston Haupt. Haupt? You're sure? Two years ago, I watched him serv up a cubscout at a party. I'm sure. Hey! Hey! Hey, do not take my money! That is some bullshit! Hey! About you ashing vampires... Yeah? Keep it up. Blade The Series - 103 - Descent That's tags? Yeah, car belongs to one Patricia Barton. Waitress, married, mother of 3. Disappeared some place between her last shift and her home in Spearfith, South Dakota. I went to her wedding. They were about to adopt. It's connected to that rest stop thing at Sturges? What thing? Just came in. Trucker vanished from the rest stop. Lots of blood, no body. Whoever it was torched the cargo. Where's the truck? - Have to ask Sturges. - You ask 'em. Please. I'm told you're not drinking enough. The more hemoglobin your body metabolizes, the faster you regenerate damaged tissue. Allow me. The curative properties should be particularly potent... I just fed. Sorry about Fritz. His demise was an unfortunate necessity. One you recognized and acted upon. Otherwise Blade would have taken him. For preventing that, you have my most sincere appreciation. Only few have faced Blade and survived. I guess I got lucky. No, you had an angel on your shoulder. How are you feeling? Thankful. It's amazing... sometimes... how things work out. Krista needs her rest. I think we can leave this door unlocked now. And Krista... don't forget to drink. Oh, thank you. What's this? For services rendered. You found Kane. Is he dead? Man's doing a public service. Keeping people hooked on dead vampire ash? Sometimes you have to take the good with the bad. From my side, it's all bad. Well, if you can't use it. Wait, wait, no, I can use it. I can use it. It's just... I'm out here treating the symptom and you're going after the disease, no doubt about it. What's you point? There might be another approach. Not for me. Good luck. You know it's all getting bad, don't you? It always does. Krista! Thank God! Are you all right? Where did I get this? Can't remember. I gave it to you. Your 6th birthday. Honey, where have you been? We haven't heard from you in days. I've been busy. Well, where are you staying? Uncle Pat's been looking everywhere. I'm sorry. Honey, are you in trouble? Just trying to make things right. For us. For Zach. For Zach? Oh Krista! What are you doing? I'm just... I'm just letting you know I won't be around for a while. Mom! Mom! - Here. Here. Go over here. - No, I'm ok. I'm good. I'm good. - What's the matter? - I'm fine. I just don't wanna lose you. Krista, if anything bad happened, Zach's gone. You're all I have left. I know we've had our troubles... Mom. I just want time. I want to get to know my daughter again. I want it like it was. There'll be time for that. But I need to do this first. And I need you to trust me. Please. You're so cold. If I can track you, so can Chthon. I had to see my mother. Get in. If Marcus even suspects you still have links to your past... Marcus spends his time renovating old buildings, - I don't think having a link to my past... - That's his cover. Yours doesn't include dropping in on mom's. If you're pissed about Fritz... No. You played it right. How's that healing? - Slowly. - Good. What did they give to Fritz to make him immune? - It's called Aurora. - What is? Some kind of vaccine. Marcus made it. No. Someone made it for him. - Any ideas about that? - No. - Are they all on it? - I don't know. Get me a sample. Sure I'll get right on that. And while I'm doing that, what are you gonna be doing? Looking for a vampire named Sands. Why? He may be one of Marcus' failed experiments. See if he can lead me to the doctor in charge. I didn't sign up for this. Yes, you did. You wanted to know what Marcus is up to, I told you. If I get you this vaccine, this Aurora thing, that's your proof. After that, I'm done. Come on! Son of a bitch! Used to be a halfly respectable joint. Now they let in everybody in here. Let's go. Or what? You're gonna stake me right here? Take a hike, daywalker. Eye in the sky is watching you. Okay, go ahead. Kill me, see if I care. 'Cause living for everything ain't nothing but one long bust. What? You're gonna sunglass me to death? Wondering about the scars. Go to hell. What do you want? I wanna know who did that. Okay. You want information I wanna keep breathing so... here are my terms. Here are the terms. You talk and you get to keep your rotten dick. Ah ah! Junk grows back! Then I'll be busy. Time to run! That's off limits. Oh, it is? I'm sorry. I didn't know. This place is like a maze. Where's the kitchen? Marcus wants you. Now. You don't trust her, do you? I trust your judgement. That wasn't the question. Yes, it was. How are you this evening? Bored? You can say it. No, just wondering what I'm gonna be doing for the next few hundred years. Some decades I wondered the same. We're shorthanded at the moment. We need you to make a delivery. 140 Park Place. Give that to Vanessa. Carver and Schultz. - Is that a law firm? - No. Well, do I need to know what's in the bag? Do you? The clock is ticking. Evening, boys. This is a private game. I've got my invitation right here. Hey, hot stuff. Johnny Black on the rocks. Hold the rocks, make it a double. You were cheating vampires? Yeah, mostly scum from the House of Armaya. You fleest Armayans. And I thought you lived dangerously. 2,000. Raise. 5,000. Oh yeah? Gotta be in it to win it, huh? Call. Cheater! Hey, today must be my lucky day. You know? Think again, hot stuff. I walked right into an ambush. They dragged us out and they locked us up in cages right there. The whole operation was right there. The lab, scientists types and lots of knives. How did you get out? A few weeks later, I found a loose brick in the wall. that lead to a crack in the foundations so I crawled through, dug my way out. Some of the others were behind me when it all hit the fan. They didn't make it. Pal, I've been reading faces a long time. Yours is telling me you know exactly what's going on. Who carved me up? The hired help. Research scientists who work for one of the Houses. Researching what? Tell me. What was I there for? What was I there for? What I need from you is a name. The doctor in charge. I don't have one. Okay? Nobody used names. No nametags. Okay, let's go. Go where? Go there? No! No way. i'm not going. You're kidding me? Just in case. Carver and Schultz? I think you missed all the fun. Yeah. Congratulations. I'm just glad the damn thing is finally over. Vanessa's been expecting you. Vanessa? Only as fast as I can. Sorry, I thought you were my boss. No problem, just making a delivery. Is everything okay? Tell the doctor I said thanks. Sure. Which doctor should I thank? I work for a few. Okay, seen enough can we go now? You get the point, right? There's not much to see here so... Keep it up, he's gonna nail your jaw shut. Ah! Looks like a dead-end to me. Now can you just take me back or kill me, please? Or you could smash my head through a wall. You want the 6 or the 9? The 9 should do. Watch our backs. Hey, how about I get one of he big weapons? Shut up. No, really, my timing's off. I've got this thing with my eye... Seriously, shut up! They kept 10 of us in here. All from the House of Armaya. Except me. First 2 weeks, they didn't feed us. No blood, no nothing. Then when we were too weak to stand, took us out one by one. And did what? We're not talking about that. Lab was down here. Let's get this over with. Stop! Four aces, my ass! I ain't good. I'm hungry. Buffet is closed, Pal. Time to follow. We gotta go. I've got one last thing I gotta kill. Get out of here. You're done. What? Don't make him say it twice. I think we may have the doctor's home. How? Trace those. Tell me who bought that. Might just be another Van Sciver front. Might not be. Hope you don't mind. Pretty. Where did you get it? Found it. What are you doing? Seeing what you have to wear. These aren't my clothes. I don't know where they came from. We pick a few things up here and there, along the way. Did you make the delivery? Yeah. Did you peek? I bet you peeked, didn't you? No. We're going out. Just you and me. Still haven't found the truck driver. But if the prints are in the system, we should get a hit by tomorrow. You said they were pallets. Right over here. Who's he cargo? Based on the remains, we think it was people. Alive? Dead folk don't need oxygen. What is this? Sex trafficking, illegal body parts, I've never seen this before. For the record, the truck has Michigan's plates but there's no record of any company based out of Michigan or anywhere in the country for that matter by the name of American Butcher. It's hot fire. To get this kind of ash, you need 1500 degrees. And the truck, it's barely burned. Not likely when the fire lasts 2 seconds. So how does that happen? You caught me. This is interesting. This pallet is pretty much untouched. There is no ignition source. Either there was nothing on it or maybe somebody came along and took what was there before doing the driver and torching the cargo. What's this gotta do with your kidnapping? Maybe nothing it was just a busy night. And weird. Very weird. I'll be over there if you have any more questions. Hi, my name is Sarah. Hi, Sarah. I had a rough week. Not that anyone cares all that much. But I got through it. One day at a time, right? Look, I'm not gonna stand here and play victim. Sure it would be really easy, I could tell you my ex husband was a real sick bastard. Tell you how he'd get wasted and smack me around. Bring his buddies home so they could have their turn. That's not who I am anymore. That pathetic, cowering little girl is long dead and buried along with all the nightmares and all the suffering. Nobody gets to hurt me anymore. Nobody. Just sitting the whole funny. Trolling for the drags, the ones no one will miss. Well, all right Sarah. Takes a mighty strong woman to do what you did. And I love strong women. That'd be my addiction of choice. If you had a choice. - Name is Phil. - Pleased to meet you. Who's your friend? Oh, that's Chuck. Chuck! Chuck, meet Carol. Hey, Carol. Yeah, so I've been rebuilding the thing for about a year now. It was my dad's truck so... sentimental reasons and all that. Sure. Hey, Carol. Do you think you kids may wanna run off and have a good time? - Run off where? - Well... We're going in here. If this alley's a-rocking. Don't come a-knocking. - Your friend's pretty funny. - Yeah. - So, how long have you been sober for? - No! What do you mean no? Oh, you need a drink to loosen up. Stupid bitch! Phil? You gotta get out of here! Hey, you're all right man? Phil? Jesus Christ! What are you doing? - I... - You're gonna eat that? Don't sweat it. A puppet killed takes a little getting used to. We should go. Just a second. After you. Everybody okay? We're fine. My boyfriend just passed out! Okay, according to customs, the entire production batch was shipped from a manufacturer in Pennsylvania to a clearing house in the Ukraine. Set for 9 months before being shipped back to the US and sold to one Ravenson Wholesale Medical. Right here in Detroit. Ravenson medical database for Detroit number is 2700. - 2700 customers? - Give or take. - Get me one. - I'm grounding through that now. How you doing? Keeping your blood pressure down? Dropping in unannouced? Not a good idea. Yeah, well, I saw 2 men murdered last night. - Did you feed? - Screw you! - Did you? - No. You need more serum. I'm fine. Considering... You just came by to cry on my shoulder? What about Aurora? I know where they're keeping it but security's tight. Get around it. How about I just tell you where it is and then you can go in and get it yourself? Too noisy. Since when that's ever been a problem for you? I've been doing this a long time. I make a move, they counter it. They make a move, I react. It's time to change the game. If I'm gonna keep them from winning this fight, I have to trust another human being. Just so happens she's a vampire. And how hard is that? Almost impossible. Take care of yourself. I'll get you what you want. Thank you. In case you're interested, I found the doctor. You a cop? Took the eggs overeasy. Sure. I bet your family doesn't appreciate you bringing your work home with you. It doesn't bother them anymore. And a bacon too. Sure. Good luck with that. Collins. Hey, I've got these print results back from the truck. Okay, hold on. Okay, go ahead. The print belongs to a fellow out of Detroit. - Name? - Brian Boone. 510. 190 pounds. Oh, and he just happens to be one of Detroit's finest. He's a cop? A homicide detective to be precise. One who's been recently listed as missing. - Is this your guy? - I'll let you know. Can I help you? Next time on Blade. Blade! Welcome home, old man. I can deliver you Blade, wrapped up and ready to die. - What's in Oregon? - The House of Lychan. They know where Boone is. No, you do.
