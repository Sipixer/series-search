He has all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses. Except of the thirst. He lives off a synthetic serum. - Did Marcus change you? - My husband did. And lived to regret it. Now Krista, it's time for your first kill. Dispatch, I need an ambulance ASAP. Did you say an ambulance ? A little late for that, sweetheart. The print belongs to a fellow out of Detroit. Brian Boone. 510. 190 pounds. Oh, and he just happens to be one of Detroit's finest. He's a cop? I'm out here treating the symptom and you're going after the disease, no doubt about it. What's your point? There might be another approach. Not for me. What did they give to Fritz to make him immune? - It's called Aurora. - What is? Some kind of vaccine. Marcus made it. No. Someone made it for him. Everything's come back. Amnosynthesis tested negative for AFPE. No blood disorders, no neurotube defects, and no abnormalities on the sonogram. So our baby's fine? He's perfectly normal. Doctor Vonner? Where is the doctor? Oh my god! Oh my god! There's a dead-end. I suggest you get his files and get out of there. No time for that. Send me his home address. Marcus got his people in and out right now. So you think this baby doctor thing was just for fun? There's a reason Marcus recruited him for Aurora. Hm, if you believe this guy's press. He was a miracle worker. He looks like he worked one for Marcus. Every vampire needs a familiar with skills. Yeah, I make the weapons. And I use them. That's the arrangement. No shit! I thought we were dating. Blade? Blade? Nailed is ass. Damn straight. Blade The Series - 104 - Bloodlines Chain him up. Zack was here. Can I get you anything else? No, I'm done. All right, you can pay at the register when you're done. You play soccer? Good evening. - Hey! - Hey! Well... That is a dead-end. Every vampire needs a familiar with skills. Ah, I make the weapons, and I use them, that's the arrangement. Bullshit, I thought we were dating. Little man. *** this. Damn straight. We have Aurora. We know it works. You were going to kill Doctor Vonner anyway. Blade just saved you the trouble. At the moment, I have different troubles. Those shipments were your responsability. And so is Boone, I'll take care of him. No. You and Krista will together. I don't need her! Boone is Krista's first turn. There's a connection between them that can be exploited. Marcus... not the House of Lychan. The shortest distance between Boone and Krista is through theit shared experience. I'll find Boone another way. - He left a trail... - That ends in the middle of Kansas! I don't have time to humor your sordid past! Find Boone and use Krista! What? Charlotte's calling. Tell her we'll find Boone. I'm gonna tell her you already have. Hey! Blade? Blade? Carlyle. I'm here to negociate for your release. You're okay? Shut up and start negociating! Things need killing. Well, that's just it. I'm, I'm negotiating with you. I'm with them, this was my idea. Then I'll be killing you too! Little help? Heard you halfway down the hall. Gained a little weight? Time to clean up your mess. Boone... He's loose and complicating matters. That's impossible. I killed him. You turned him. To kill him, you'd have to drain him. Being an amateur, you didn't. Now you're gonna see how the other half lives. - Other half of what? - Us. Pack a bag. - We're flying to Oregon. - What's in Oregon? The House of Lychan. And they know where Boone is? No, you do. Lychan's just going to take it out. Wait a minute. You mind telling me what I'm walking into? Sweetheart, walking in is not a problem. I bet you wonder why you're here. I told you there was another way to fight the war. You weren't always the man you are now. You still need a little redemption. With the help of a few old friends. Just go ahead. Say hello. Remember him? Remember your childhood. Little man. Steppin' Razor. It's been a while. What you're going by now little man: Blade. You got a deep rep, you're big, bro! Not too big though. Welcome home, little man. Blade? Hello? Blade's gone. Taken off the street by four masked vampires. - Now what would you know about that? - Shen... Where is he? - Marcus didn't do it. - Bullshit. You come here to finish things off? You don't believe me? Shoot. What are you doing here? Boone's alive. - The cop? - He is turned. No shit. That's what happen when a vampire... Shut up, and get the gun out of my face! Boone's going around killing people and Chase and I have been ordered to eliminate him. Shen? I don't know what happened to Blade. Ok. I got to torch this place and go. Wait a minute. You're leaving? That's the protocol. What happens to me? We all got problems. Shen, what do you know about the House of Lychan? Lychan vampires have sworn off killing, they drink clone blood. I'm going there to find Boone. He's there? No. Then why are you... Oh, well... What? You can't go Krista. They have this ritual. You've ever heard sweat lodge the native American thing where you see visions? What, they want me to see Boone? That's the idea, except there's no sweat. Just lots of blood. How much blood? You can't do it. If it will stop Boone... I'm doing it. Hey! Good luck with Blade. I've got serum. You're gonna need more. And after it's done, inject it, all of it. First chance you get. Ok, thanks. Good luck to you too. Jesus! Blade? Blade??? *** this. Damn straight. What is that? It's the last transmission. Rewind it. I can hear them. It's static. Shen, I can hear them. I thought we were dating. - It's taken off of context. - Shh. Blade? Blade??? *** this. Damn straight. What? They're still talking. Play it again. He ain't so bad. He used to be. But he's no Bad Blood anymore. Bad Blood? Bad Blood... I guess you're pretty thristy by now. Probably want to get back on that serum of yours. Yeah, I know about that. And I know what you did on the streets. After your father left. Before Whistler found you, such bad things to these poor boys. They're weren't exactly boyscouts. But they took you in off the streets. And you took their souls for it, you took their lives. Cue the violins. Because they were been turned by you, they've been rejected by every House. Forced to live on their own, to do horrible things just to survive. I can fix them. I've gotten through to them. They want stop feeding, stop killing. They just need your serum to do it. They don't want my serum. They want me, and now that they've got me, you're nothing but their next meal. Your real bleeding heart here... I can't believe how much you've changed little man. I wish that I could tell you that it's not too late That you could come back. Be a brother again. But we got plans we need to execute. Let me guess... Comfort plan. Yeah. You're gonna help us, little man. You're gonna change our life. You're Agent Collins? You're Detective Gibbs? I'm, you're ready? Yep. How long were you and Boone partners? About two years. The last six months, he was more of a solo act. Took a lot of personal time. Any idea why? We stopped talking, I mean about anything other than the number of girls he was banging. Pretty long list if you believe the stories. Did you? There was a lot of detail. Any talk of personal problems, where he might have gone if things got bad? Like a beach in Bahi or something? No. He talked about the future a lot, what he'd like to live in a 100 years from now. What like science-fiction? No, not really, more like, like standard vacation. Yeah, I didn't get it either. - You need a key? - You got one? He speaks German? The only thing I ever saw him read was a menu and he couldn't pronounce half of it. You recognize this? What's Armaya? Look at you. Playing vampire cop. You won't think I'm playing when I turn your ass up in smoke! Yeah. There's that look. Are you trying to tell me you're going to kill me? Who taught you that look? You were a kid, lost and scared! No place for nobody. A scrowny ass, little blood sucker. You fed, you killed. Some you turned. Remember that night you turned us? Bolt was joining us. I was giving him his tats. I was just wiping the fresh blood off the back of neck. You must have tasted in the air. That's what brought you to us. Back when we were just kids. I was just a kid too! No! That night you were a killer. You walk right into this place here. All shaking and crying and saying you were hungry. We offered you shelter and food. We reached out to help you. You bit us for it. You turned us into addicts. Gave us the thirst. That pain so deep inside that it never goes away. Oh, yeah, you got the thirst right now, don't you? That's what you gave us. But we ran with it. And you ran with us. Hell. You were proud to wear our mark and live under our protection. But you were smaller than the others. Different. A brother. I would have done anything for you, Little Man. And I did. I killed a lot of people. You were killing way before I even met you. And that's what will be when this is over. That's how we survive. Damn! You really don't know what you did to us after you left. You remember that night Whistler came knocking ? That old man killed Brick, and cut off before he drag you away. We told he'd ash your sorry ass! About a decade later, we started to hear rumors about this vampire killer named Blade. Big bad scary mother. Tatoos crawling up the back of his neck. Sunlight don't burn him. Guess Whistler gave you a different thirst, a thirst for killing us addicts. Addicts that you turned us too. When you got your new rep, as a daywalker, all the Houses started ashing every vampire you ever turned. Every one that comes from your blood. Bad Bloods had go underground. Like goddamn rats! While you traveled all over the world. But you're home now. Hell! You even still dress like a Bad Blood. With the coat, the glasses. You still got our mark. But it wasn't you. Rep says, uh, without your serum, you can't see straight. Every minutes that goes pass, you're more like us. Feel the thirst, like us! Hurt like us! Bleed like us! I will keep you alive. I need you alive. Nothing can take back what happened. No. Nothing can. But... you can help us, little man. You can help us live our whole long lives a whole lot better! See, we're tired of hiding! We want what we gave you! A home. Wherever you build it, I'm gonna burn it down! Little man still thinks he's gonna be a hero. He's crazy but it's good to have a dream. Reality is always better. Especially when we've got an ace in the hole. Give me that. You get something for that. I'll get it. You just be sure you save me some. Gang violence on the rise. Bad Bloods terrorize Krainze Woods neighborhood. Bad Bloods gang member shot, paralysed. Hello, Chase. - A pleasure to see you again. - Save the talk. And you must be Krista. I'm Doctor Berganza, we are absolutely delighted to have you here. Everything's been prepared. Let's go, ladies, we have a lot to do. If you'd like to leave your bags here, somebody will collect them. It's not often that we get visitors from other Houses for the most part they seem to stay away. Possibly because you're all bat shit. If that assesment eases your discomfort in some way then by all means you stick to it as long as you require. But the dialisys machines are downstairs. The what? It's an essential step in the processing. We keep things very clean here. Yes, because according to the freaks, we are dirty girls, our blood must be cleansed. Apparently it reaks of death. It does. Hello, Chase. And how is life with Marcus? Never a dull moment. How nice for you. Are you going to introduce me? Krista, meet Frederick. My ex-husband. Why have you suddendly got ambition? Well you got to start somewhere. Yes, yes you do. Although, you unfortunately started with Blade. What does that mean? That means he turned you. And now I hear you and your lost boys are looking for a home? We just want in. I'll be blunt. My superiors will not allow streets scum tainted by the blood of the Daywalker in the House of Chthon. We'd not adopt polluted strays. You must try the House of Sacara, they're... less particular. Yeah. About that Daywalker... And... this means what to me? It means that I can deliver you Blade, wrapped up and ready to die. And for this gift you want keys to my front door? I think your superior will make an exception. What do you think? I think you like risk. Could pay off if it's worth it. Sometimes you have to take things to get things. I'm sure you've taken plenty. Things your superiors know nothing about. And you're planning on taking more, don't you? A lot more. Ah, it's how men like you and me get the respect that we deserve. Oh, is that what you're doing? Getting respect? I'm giving you Blade! You're gonna kill him or not? Welcome. Now where do I find him? Germaine Turner? You got the wrong guy. Mmh. In case you're thirsty. Who are you? Doesn't matter. After this, you'll never see me again. What? Back in the seventies, you used to be a member of a street gang called the Bad Bloods? After you were shot, what happened to the rest of the gang? They disappear. They all die. How did they die? Little man. Little man? Who's...? So I won't find the bodies in a cemetary, will I? Now you listen to me. If you got anybody that cares about you, that loves you, or depends on you for living, you'll stop asking questions and stop looking for whatever it is you're looking for. Cause if you find it, you'll wish to God you didn't. You see, it's because somebody depends on me for living, that thing I'm looking for, I'm gonna find it. And that thing is whatever you son of bitches called a home. Now tell me where I can find the Bad Bloods? How long is this gonna take? That's up to you. Listen to me, this isn't magic, there's no pentagrams using, chanting and essence burning. When we kill, what you've done or you wouldn't be here, energy's released. Which takes you into an after death that experience. Been there. So has Boone. Because of you, you're connected. Now because of your new metabolic chemistry, your senses have been retuned, calibrated higher. What we do here is simply turn up the dial even more. If we can turn it high enough, you can pick up the energy of your first kill. You'll be able to find him wherever he is. Now here is the rough part, you're going to come out of this incredibly thirsty. You must be careful, not to drink too much blood too fast. Or what? Or Boone's energy will take root in your soul. And whoever you were will be gone forever. I'm already gone. Whoever you were, still very strong in you. I can see that. And you'd better be careful because Chase can see it too. Now don't worry. I'll be your guide. I've got some experience on this. With Chase? You turned her? Yes. Sorry to break this up. But can we please get this over with? Let's find your problem, child, shall we? You get us into this, little man. You'll get us out. Marcus Van Sciver exposed me that. One more last thing to do before we... turn you over to our new family, Blade. Let's take those tatoos back. And cut that skin clean off. That's it, little man. Scream for me. *** I used to be like you. I used to be his friend. But he screws us all over. Everyone he touches, he hurts. Mostly he just touches vampires. And yeah, it hurts. Another time, little man. So much for the Cosby kids. I swear to God, if you say thank you I'm quitting. Just give me a minute. Where is Krista? Oh that's a story. Funny. Suck me. Collins? That's me Gibbs. Brought you those files you asked for. All of Boone's open cases. Do me a favor, don't tell my Cap'. I wanted the last three months. That's what you got. What can I say, Detroit is a dangerous place to live. Runaways, protistutes, roll over pushers. Boone's specialty. I guess you could say he had a soft spot for lost souls. What about this one? What's the name? Starr, Zach Starr? Single GSW to the head, no viable suspects, yes, that's one of Boone's special projects. - You heard of this? - Yeah. Case was never closed. What about the soldier? I assumed Boone wanted to screw her. - Did he? - I don't know. She went missing, if she turns up, you can ask her. If she's still alive... Next time on Blade. - What did you see? - I know, I know! His next stop, it's a small town in Louisiana. Just kill him and come home. She's pregnant, but the question is... of what. I believe we may have a problem with Marcus. Dust 'em all! Boone!
