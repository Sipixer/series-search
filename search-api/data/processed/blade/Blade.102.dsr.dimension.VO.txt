Detroit. Who is taking possession ? Marcus Van Sciver. You've been picking through a lot of keyholes, Zack. It's my brother. Your brother got caught up and somebody shot him, okay ? Got in over his head, he pissed off the wrong people just like every single one of these guys. The ash. It's found its way onto the streets now. With the rest of the drugs. There's a whole other world underneath this one, Krista. Do yourself a favor. Get out of the city ! You know who killed my brother. If we have a little patience, we can find out what they're up to, what their operations are. You look familiar. Like someone I once knew. It's ok to fight. It's only natural. You turned her ? It's my turn, my... He's here. Let me serve you. It's been fun. Fritz. That's enough. You're my new favorite. What did you do to me ? I injected you with a serum, to get you thinking straight. I can work with you. Just like I worked with your brother. I got to get back. What do you think ? Could go either away. No !!! You better do it ! Wouldn't want any vampire running around the countryside, now would we ? - Please, god! - God's off playing with himself. Just you and me now, lunch meat. Blade The Series - 102 - Death Goes On If they figured out how to neutralize garlic and silver, we are chit ??? Any sign of Krista ? Nothing. Good morning, sweetheart. You must be hungry. Mom ? You can't be here. I know, it's all so confusing. But it will come down. You just need to eat. Get out ! Get out ! Get out ! Krista ! No ! No !!! Oh god... Help ! Help ! Help ! Bloody newborns! You had night terrors for ten years. She won't last that long. But she's gone the first chance I get. What's different ? In this world. What's new ? Besides, you deciding to work with a revenge-crazed vampire chick. Ash. Vampire ash. Now you think Marcus is juicing his own troups ? I'll have to have Fritz when I'll catch him. You mean kill him. Catch him. Dissectr him. Then kill him. Does the silver burn? No. It tickles. I'm going to think you like this. Marcus. - Pleasant flight? - No complaints. Heard you raised a few eyebrows. It's a new girl ? An essential addition to the fold. And how is Prague ? Missing you. I'll never understand what you see in this despicable city. It has a special place in my heart. Hello, Winston. Chase. Fritz. Trenched in blood as always. And how are you ? Feeling like a rock star ? I'm feeling like a rematch. Blade. I see. Is that wise? No, not yet. The  vaccine works. We should take advantage of it. Fritz. Blade's interference must make things difficult. We're moving RND to the West Coast. Trucks carrying test subjects should be arriving now. Well, that will be welcomed news for the board. You're sure the vaccine is stable ? Yes, it's stable. Then perhaps a new day has dawned. I haven't done ash in two days. It's so hard. Ok. You spend this on aspirine, antiseptic and food for your baby. Cherry ? Cherry ? You're listening to me ? Yes, sir. Next meeting tomorrow on noon, you stay out of the ash until there. And keep your fingers out of your mouth. Thank you, Reverend. Sorry for the interruption. The  church let you back in ? They call me Reverend out of respect. You don't have to be ordained to have a calling. As you already know. Having much success? Some. Vampire  ash ain't like the usual junk. best stuff hooks you bone deep. I was wondering if you'd ever return. And now I can start worrying that my recovering ashes are gonna get caught up in your crossfire. Your ashes ? All they need is a little help and I offer 'em empathy, support, love. You should try it sometimes. Back to the question. There's some vampire moving in on the ash trade. Wouldn't surprise me. Feeding off our own. But you've heard nothing concrete ? Experiments. On vampires, might be ash related, might not. How will I find out ? You know an ash dealer named Cain ? Not yet. So maybe Cain will give you some answers. How do I find Cain ? Try to ask one of his customers. But watch yourself. If they're amped up on vampires dope, you might find yourself in some serious shit. Where's Cain ? How much ash did you do? All of it. Like I've got time for this. I hear you're having a difficult time. Yeah, death's a bitch. You're not dead, Krista. My life is over. What I was, where I was going. All that's gone. Your life is just beginning. My life is what ? Some sort of a prisonner ? My door's locked. It's just a precaution. Newborns sometimes snap. It's only until your mind and body reconcile with the metabolic changes. Here I was thinking it was because nobody trusted me. Perhaps I haven't given you the proper respect. Yeah, throwing me off the building was a little rude. Yeah, you were trying to kill me, let's not forget. I haven't. You will. We should talk. Aren't we ? I mean over dinner. I'll collect you in one hour. And what's on the menu ? Leftovers. Courtesy of Detective Boone. We're not all monsters, Krista. This will get easier. I promise. - Yes. - This complicates things ? Immeasurably. Is Chase in on the joke ? No. Only the doctor. And he's more surprised then I am. It's all I can do to keep on track. Maybe this is fate trying to tell you something. Well, there is a bigger picture Winston, much bigger. Yes. Let's hope the board never sees it. I'll leave that up to you. Safe journey. And to you, my friend. We're making a detour. Take me to Meanus. Yes, sir. Who's this ? Asher. Is he high ? Oh, yeah. Son of a bitch. One more time, where's Cain ? Go to hell ! Who is Cain ? A lead that Carlyle gave me. What about Fritz ? Fine. Then I won't tell you that Marcus made reservation for two at Lotus. How did you find out ? Hey, it's what you don't pay me for. Is he with Krista ? That, I can't tell you. But it is his usual table. From what I hear, a nice one. Keep your fingers away from him. Anything here tempt your palate ? What are they tranqued with ? You won't taste it. It's a new herbal recipe. Too many complaints with the other stuff. Mmh,  good. But I was hoping for something a little more cornfed. It's not everyday I get to sample American cuisine. You're in luck. I've just took possession of an honor student from Illinois out on vacation. Plucked from a Cancun beach. Blonde, big boned. Carpet matches drapes? Hardwood floor. Kids! Don't be so surprised. - I just... wasn't expecting... - Food ? Thank you. Nutrionally, its effect are negligeable. But it is pleasurable nonetheless. You have noticed your senses are hightened. Is that what we're living for now ? Pleasure ? Some of us. As in most families, there are the breadwinners and the freeloaders. What are we ? If I'm successful, the House of Chthon is going to be something different entirely. What's that ? Eternal. You were thinking we are already ? Apart from silver and garlic we'll live forever ? No. Granted our years on this earth are generous. But like most lives. We're subjects to nature occasional calling. And your experiments in the slaughterhouse ? I'm assuring we are not subject to anything. Least of all nature. - What about... - Blade ? Ashers ? You know about them. I know that there's a drug trade based on dead vampires. I'd imagine that's a problem for you. Increasingly. Well, maybe one day they'll take out Blade. Blade isn't a vampire. He's a Daywalker. half human. And he is the bane of the Twelve Houses. Twelve Houses ? Ah yes. Your new family is quite extended. Is everyone here ? No. Just us. You alright ? - I don't think so. - Krista ! It's the serum. Food will make you sick. That's nice to know. - Marcus is up there. - I know. I need information on Fritz. Like what ? He is not your average vampire. Find out what you can. How he did it. Hurry. Krista ? Feeling better ? Next stop ? Hell ! Yo Cain. Product's in the back. He just fed so step on it a few times. How many times ? 23. Just make it last. Dipshit. You're keeping the car ? Crash it. Is there a problem ? Winston missed his flight. We can't trace the driver. GPS ? The signal was terminated. But we did get a final fix. Where ? M eanus. You're driving. You are staying here. I don't think that's a good idea. You said what? If Blade took Winston... In all likelyhood, you're Blade number one target. If you cross paths, either you'll kill him, he'll kill you or quite possibly he'll take you down and carve you up thereby discovering and ruining all of our considerable efforts. I'm not going to risk that. Neither should you. Is that quiet clear ? Yeah. Can I get something to drink now ? You haven't told where Cain is. I don't know anything. Swear to god ! You know. Please, can I get some blood ? It'll chew off my gut. How about an appetizer ? What happens now ? He wakes up in a ditch and leads me to Cain. That's positive thinking ? He's an addict. I'm a threat. He needs to protect his source. Something I know a little about. We found him maybe 30 minutes after Winston left. Look, Blade's in town, right ? Maybe Blade got him. Blade got Winston. The man is a scurge. You really should do something about it. This wasn't Blade. Blade wouldn't have just stopped Winston. He would have come in here, slaughtered you and then freed the poor soldiers celled to people like us. Where can Chase find a towel? There's a closet in there. So, how was your asher problem ? It's not so bad. Ok. Ok, so we've had some little trouble lately. Please, Marcus, don't shut me down. Look, I'm upgrading security. I've a vested interest in keeping my clientele as safe as possible. And how many of your clients have you lost so far ? This month, 4... 5 if you want to count Winston. If I must ? What's with the towel ? He's shuting you down. That's a private party ? Yeah. Get out ! I thought you were Marcus' right hand man. Seems strange him not letting you... do what you do. He has his reasons. Which you don't agree with. Not sure I do either. Things change. Take you. One day you're home from Iraq. The next thing you're the boss' new plaything. You're walking around, asking questions. I'm asking you. What happened ? I don't get why Blade would wanna carve you up. What's he gonna learn ? Nothing. He'll be dead. And I'll be the one to kill him. In broad daylight. But that's not possible. Like I said, things change. One day you're scared shitless of a pizza topping. And the silver fillings of some old man's teeth. Of the dawn's early goddamn light. The sun doesn't matter anymore. Because you're different. Because you believed in something. You helped make some things happen. What happened ? Project Aurora. Five years and millions of dollars. And a thousand dead vampires later. You get me... The vaccines were a success, and where am I ? In the basement, beating meat. Sorry. Honey, it's okay. It will be over soon, I promise. Just need to talk about this. I'm sorry I don't know. I swear to god, I don't know anything. We know you use it. That you use us. That your blood smells so bad that it makes me want to drown you in it. I'll quit snorting ash, I will I promise. I've got a baby. I've  got a little boy please. Does his blood reak too ? No, no, no, no, please, no ! You tell me you took my friend Winston and your boy grows safe and sound. Cross my barely beating hearts. Give me a name or I'll eat him in front of you. I think we must assume that Winston is gone. Yes, Charlotte, yes. I'm taking care of that problem. Yes, but as I outlined in the proposal, Blade's involvement is inevitable. I'm just surprised you're taking this... Yes, Charlotte, absolutely. Everything will be handled. All assets will be secured. They want proof of Aurora's success. I'm right here. But there're not willing to send another evaluator. They want you in Prague. And you want me as far away from Blade as possible. I know you're eager to finish what you started. But Blade must wait. I'm beholden from those above me, and they demand caution. We have done an amazing thing but no one must know how we did it. Fritz ? Fritz tells me you caught him in a weak moment. Aurora ? I want it. You want ? We should all have it. If it's everything that Fritz said it is. Fritz has no idea what it is. And neither do you. And you will not discuss it anymore especially with Fritz. What did you do to him ? He's going away tonight. Some place safe. Marcus. The girl, she knew who took Winston. - Are you certain ? Dead. His name is Cain. He deals in ash. We hit him. We hit the largest ash lab in Detroit. I can have a red team ready in one hour. Good. Let's take the war hero. I'm sure you'll find it invigorating. That's a splendid idea. Krista. Keep your head down. Where are you going? A warehouse in West Mile. Where you ate the raver ? Stop with me. You best get packed. See you in a few days. Kill everything. Burn it to the ground. Hey ! Let me in. Hey, let me in ! I got to see Cain, I got to warn him. Shit's coming down. Blade. I didn't tell him anything. You didn't have to. Stupid son a bitch ! Man, I did you a favor. Thanks for that. Give me the belt. Guys, down there. Stay with me. This way ! We got movement on the north side. Say again. Repeat, movement inbound. Get a fix and pin it down. We'll do. I'll investigate and report back. Let's get going. Sorry, sir. Just listening to the assault feed. - Seems like Chase's got her hands full. - What's happening ? - Not sure, something inbound. - Really? Go ! They're gone. Something over here ! Where's Cain ? Chase ? Shut up. God, don't ! I can't move my leg. So much for the frying pan. Welcome to the fire. Fritz ! Stop, Fritz ! Let's finish this ! Krista, don't let him take Fritz ! Krista, kill him ! Do it now ! You think she's gone native? No. She killed the golden goose. Fritz was the key. She did what she had to do. She's the key. She's the way in. And what about Cain ? Another day. Hey ? Wake up ! Dispatcher, I need a coroner on county 319, 2 miles east of the Boxton overpass overpassed and a tow truck. Better tell the crime lab to. What you got ? Body under a blanket in a silver Dodge. South Dakota plate 3 6 Adam 4 7 9 current. Body appears male. No obvious signs of foul play. Hardware's rolling. ETA in 15 minutes. Thanks, Dany. Somebody in there ? I'm a state trooper. I'm armed. Come out hands first. Dispatch, I need an ambulance ASAP. Did you say an ambulance ? Come back. Too late for that, sweetheart. Next time on Blade. I think we waked up the neighboors. Ready to answer my question ? I need you to make a delivery. Do I need to know what it's in the bag ? Do you ? You killing vampires ? Scum from the House of Armaya.
