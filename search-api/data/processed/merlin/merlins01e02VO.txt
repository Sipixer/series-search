rests of the shoulders of a young boy. His name...Merlin. I understand you have a shield for me. With your swordcraft and this shield, I guarantee you'll win. - Show me how it works. - Certainly. Thara ymbsittendra ofer hronradehyran scolde. When you're competing in the tournament, you pin your opponent under the shield, a snake strikes... Your opponent will be paralysed. The snakes are now under your command. They will do anything??? - Anything? - Just say the word. Kill him. Knight Valiant of the Western Isles. - I'm here for the tournament. - Welcome to Camelot. www.1000fr.com presents Capture:chocolate Sync:FRS@Óêäì</font> Merlin Ready? Would it make any difference if I said no? Not really. ARTHUR: Body. Shield. Body. Shield. MERLIN: Shield. - Head. - Head? Ow. Come on, Merlin. You're not even trying. i know Once more. To the left. Right. And left. Head. Come on, Merlin. I've got a tournament to win. Can we stop now, please? Shield. Body. Shield. Shield. Braver than you look. Most servants collapse after the first blow. - Is it over? - Just a warm-up. How's your mace-work coming along? So...how was your first day as Arthur's servant? Do you hear clanging? It was horrible. And I've still got to learn about tournament etiquette by the morning. Unheran achtun bregdan. Oi! What have I told you about using magic like this? If I could actually feel my arms... ??? ??? What do I do if you get caught? What would you do? Well, you just make sure it doesn't??? I save Arthur from being killed and I end up as a servant. How is that fair? Not sure if fairness comes into it. You never know, it might be fun. You think mucking out Arthur's horses is gonna be fun? - Should hear my list of duties. - We all have duties. Even Arthur. Must be tough for him. With all the girls, the glory. He is a future king. People expect so much of him. He's under a lot of pressure. That makes two of us. So you've got voiders on the arms. The hauberk goes over your chest. ??? I guess you know what to do with the helmet. Yeah. That was the only bit I'd figured out. How come you're better at this than me? I'm the blacksmith's daughter. I know pretty much all about armour, which is actually kind of sad. No, it's brilliant. You do know the tournament starts today? Yes, sire. You nervous? I don't get nervous. - Really? I thought everyone did. - Will you shut up? - Great. I think you're all set. - Aren't you forgetting something? My sword. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Guess, uh, you'll be needing that. That went well. UTHER: Knights of the realm, it's a great honour to welcome you to Camelot. Over the next three days, you will test your bravery, your skills as warriors and, of course, challenge the reigning champion, my son, Prince Arthur. Only one can have the honour of being crowned champion, and he will receive a prize of 1,000 gold pieces. It is in combat that we learn a knight's true nature, whether he is indeed a warrior or a coward. The tournament begins! I trust you will make me proud. Yeah! Come on! Yeah! Knight Valiant looks pretty handy with a sword. May I offer my congratulations on your victories today? Likewise. Hope to see you at the reception this evening. Creep. Uh, for tomorrow, you need to repair my shield, wash my tunic, clean my boots, sharpen my sword and polish my chain mail. - Are you using magic again? - No. What's all this, then? Just came to tell you supper's ready. Knight Valiant of the Western Isles, my lord. I saw you fighting today. Very aggressive. As my lord said, "To lose is to be disgraced." I couldn't agree more. Knight Valiant, I present the Lady Morgana, my ward. My lady. - I saw you competing today. - I saw you watching. I understand the champion escorts my lady to the feast. That's correct. I will give everything to win. My lady. - Arthur. - Father. They all seem rather impressed. - Not the only ones. - Not jealous, are you? I don't see there's anything to be jealous of. Could Arthur be any more annoying? I so hope Knight Valiant wins the tournament. - You don't really mean that. - Yes. I do. Hello? Is there someone there? Can I help you with something, boy? Nope. I'm good. I...I was just... um...gathering my master's armour. Then you'd best be on your way. Right. Yeah. No problem. - You did all this on your own? - Yes, sir. Let's see if you can get me into it without forgetting anything. That was much better. Not that it could have got any worse. I'm a fast learner. I hope for your sake that's true. Good luck. Is it my imagination or are you beginning to enjoy yourself? It... It isn't totally horrible all the time. Yes! Strike him. Strike him. SNAKE HISSES I think he's badly hurt. - How is he? - It's most odd. Look at this. These two small wounds? Looks like a snakebite. How could he have been bitten by a snake? He was injured in the swordfight. The symptoms are consistent with poisoning. - Slow pulse, fever, paralysis. - Can you heal him? If it's a bite, I have to extract venom from the snake ??? to make an antidote. If he doesn't get antidote? There's nothing I can do. He's going to die. He was fighting Knight Valiant. - What's that? - Nothing. Dinner time. come on 1I've just seen one of the snakes on Valiant's shield come alive. He's using magic. Are you sure? The snake ate a mouse - one swallow, straight down. Ewan was fighting Valiant when he collapsed. It must've been one of the snakes from the shield. I have to tell Arthur. Is there any chance you might be mistaken? - I know magic. - Perhaps. Have you any proof? Don't you believe me? You'll land yourself in trouble. - How would you explain...??? - What does that matter? He's using magic to cheat!??? You can't accuse a knight without proof - the King wouldn't accept the word of a servant over that of a knight. So what I say doesn't count? It counts for very little.??? You telling me you've got to fight that? Yes, and he's strong as a bear. But he's slow. - Ah, and you're fast. - Exactly. You're not worried, are you? No. - How are you getting on? - Fine. Just doing my job. Minding my own business. Valiant's going to fight Arthur in the final. He'll use the shield to kill him. Merlin, about what I said yesterday... Look, Uther really wouldn't listen to you or me. But you are right. We can't let Valiant get away with it. But we don't have proof. If we can cure Ewan, he could tell the King Valiant was using magic. The King would believe another knight. But how we get the antidote, that's another matter. Merlin? ALL: Long live Valiant! So, Valiant, you think you stand a chance of defeating my son? He is a great warrior, my lord. I do hope to be a worthy opponent. You should stay in Camelot after the tournament. I could do with more knights like you. I'd be honoured, my lord. I'll get started preparing the antidote. - I'm going to tell Arthur. - You'll need this. And, Merlin, what you did was very brave. You? You chopped its head off? Ewan was bitten by a snake when he was fighting.???? You can see the wounds where he was bitten. Ewan was winning - he had to cheat! Valiant wouldn't dare use magic in Camelot. Ewan was pinned under the shield - no-one could see it bite him. I don't like him but I don't think he's cheating. Gaius is preparing an antidote. When Ewan's conscious, he'll tell you. If you fight him, he'll use the shield so he can beat you. Look at it! Have you seen snakes like this in Camelot? I know I'm just a servant and my word doesn't count for anything. I wouldn't lie to you. I want you to swear to me what you're telling me is true. I swear it's true. Then I believe you. Welcome back. There was a snake on his shield. - It came alive. - You're weak. The snake's venom is still in your system. I must warn Arthur. Arthur knows. He's requested an audience with the King. They'll want to talk to you. Rest. You'll need your strength. I need to fetch more herbs. I'll be back. Why have you summoned the court? I believe Knight Valiant is using a magic shield to cheat in the tournament. - What do you have to say to this? - Ridiculous. I've never used magic. Does your son have evidence to support this??? - Do you have evidence? - I do. I'm afraid this potion tastes like toad water but it'll get you back on your feet. Ewan? Let me see this shield. Don't let him get too close. Be careful, my lord. (Merlin!) We need Ewan. Find out what's happening. ???It's an ordinary shield. He's not gonna let everyone see it come alive. How do I know what you say is true? I have a witness. Knight Ewan was bitten by a snake from the shield. Its venom made him grievously ill. However, he's received an antidote. He will confirm Valiant is using magic. Where is this witness? He should be here. Where's Ewan? He's dead. I'm waiting! I'm afraid the witness is dead. So you have no proof to support these allegations? Have you seen Valiant use magic? No. But my servant fought... Your servant? You make these outrageous accusations against a knight on the word of your servant? I believe he tells the truth. Am I really to be judged on hearsay from a boy? - I've seen those snakes come alive. - How dare you interrupt?! Guards. - My lord... - Wait. I'm sure he was merely mistaken. I wouldn't want him punished on my account. You see? This is how a true knight behaves - with gallantry and honour. My lord, if your son made these accusations because he's afraid to fight me, then I will graciously accept his withdrawal. Is this true? Do you wish to withdraw from the tournament? No! What am I to make of these allegations? Obviously there has been a misunderstanding. I withdraw the allegation against Knight Valiant. Please accept my apology. Accepted. I believed you, I trusted you, and you made me look a complete fool. I know it didn't go to plan... "Didn't go to plan"?! My father and the entire royal court think I'm a coward. You humiliated me! We can still expose Valiant. I no longer require your services. - You're sacking me? - I need a servant I can trust. You CAN trust me. Got me nowhere. Get out of my sight! Where are you?! I just came to tell you... whatever you think my destiny is, whatever it is you think I'm supposed to do, you've got the wrong person. That's it. Goodbye. DRAGON: If only it were so easy to escape one's destiny. How can it be my destiny to protect someone who hates me? A half cannot truly hate that which makes it whole. Very soon you shall learn that. Oh, great(!) Just what I needed - another riddle. That your and Arthur's path lies together is but the truth. What is that supposed to mean? You know, young warlock, this is not the end. It is the beginning. Just give me a straight answer! Hello, Merlin. All right? Is it true about Valiant using magic? What are you gonna do? Why does everyone think it's down to me? Because it is. ..Isn't it? You have to show everyone you were right and they were wrong. And how do I do that? I don't know. (That's it!) Where are you going? Do you have a wheelbarrow? What are you doing with that? Letting everyone see the snakes for themselves. "Bebay odothay. "Bebay odothay arisan quickum." Bebay odothay arisan quickum. Bebay odothay arisan quickum! Bebay odothay arisan quickum! (Bebay odothay arisan quickum.) Bebay odothay arisan quickum. I thought I told you to get out of my sight. Don't fight Valiant in the final tomorrow. - He'll use the shield. - I know. Then withdraw. You have to withdraw. Don't you understand? I can't withdraw. The people expect me to fight. ????a coward. Valiant will kill you. If you fight, you die. Then I die. How can you go out there and fight like that? Because I have to. It's my duty. Bebay odothay... ..arisan quickum. Let me. I used to help my father with his armour. Thanks. Arthur. Be careful. See you at the feast. Bebay odothay arisan quickum. GROWLING Bebay odothay arisan quickum. I did it! MERLIN LAUGHS - Arthur's fighting Valiant. - I know, I'm on my way. Oh, don't go into my room. We'll deal with it later. (Bebay odothay arisan quickum!) What are you doing? - I didn't summon you. - He IS using magic. Now they see you for what you really are. Kill him! Arthur! Looks like I'll be going to the feast after all. My honourable guests, I give you Prince Arthur, your champion. - My lady. - My champion. See, I told you he gets all the girls and the glory. And he owes it all to you. Has your father apologised for not believing you? He'll never apologise. ???You're not disappointed Valiant isn't your escort? Turns out he wasn't champion material. That was some tournament final. ???It's not every day a girl gets to save her prince. Um, I wouldn't say I needed exactly saving. I would've thought of something. You're too proud to admit you were saved by a girl. Because I wasn't. ??? I wish Valiant WAS escorting me. Me too. Then I wouldn't have to listen to you. - Fine. - Fine. Do you believe Morgana? She says she saved me. Like I needed any help. I wanted to say I made a mistake. It was unfair to sack you. No, don't worry about it. Buy me a drink and call it even. I can't really be seen to be buying drinks for my servant. Your servant? You sacked me. Now I'm rehiring you. My chambers are a complete mess, my clothes need washing, my armour needs repairing, my boots need cleaning, my dogs need exercising, my fireplace needs sweeping, my bed needs changing and someone needs to muck out my stables. We have to discover how this illness is spreading. Search every room. - What for? - The sorcerer. Where is the magic book I gave you? The most likely cause is sorcery. - Gwen - MorganaI haven't done anything. ???I'm innocent. It was me. Merlin, you will pay for this! No! Please help me!
