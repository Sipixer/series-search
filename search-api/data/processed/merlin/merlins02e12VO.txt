rests on the shoulders of a young boy.</i> His name... Merlin. Arthur's Knights Merlin - 2x12 The Fires of Idirsholas I'm a herder from the Northern Plains, Sire. Three nights back, we were camped beneath the walls of Idirsholas... I would've not chosen such a place. Good pasture is scarce, Sire. - What is it you have to tell me? - While we were there... we saw smoke rising from the citadel. - And did you see anything else? - No. Did you go inside? Nobody has stepped over that threshold for 300 years. You must know the legend. "When the fires of Idirsholas burn, the Knights of Medhir will ride again." Give him some food and a bed for the night. Take a ride out there. Why? - So we can put people's minds at rest. - Surely this is superstitious nonsense. Gather the guard and do as I say. Why's Uther so worried? Because the Knights of Medhir are a force to be reckoned with. - So you believe the story as well? - It is more than a story, Merlin. Some 300 years ago, seven of Camelot's knights were seduced by a sorcerer's call. One by one, they succumbed to her power. At her command, they became a terrifying and brutal force that rode through the lands leaving... death and destruction in their wake. What happened? It was only after the sorcerer herself was killed that the Knights of Medhir finally grew still. If what Joseph says is true, then something has awoken them. I fear for each and every one of us. Are you all right? Just a little cold. - Do you need something warmer? - No. Thank you. What is it, Merlin? Don't tell me you've been listening to Gaius' bedtime stories again. I hope that's all they are. You look well. Thanks to you. I wear it all the time. I can't remember when I last had a bad dream. You do not seem happy. Why's that? I would be, if I didn't have to pretend. Pretend? That I am Uther's loving ward... when I hate him. Have you ever imagined a new world? One where Uther was no more? Sometimes. Is that what you'd like? I once had the chance to be his assassin. And what stopped you? I don't know. I believed he cared for me. But not any more. He cares for no-one. So you want Uther destroyed and his reign to end? More than anything. But it doesn't matter what I want. The future is not of my making. You are wrong, Morgana. You underestimate your importance. The decisions you make now will change the shape of everything that is to come. What do you mean? Whose side are you on? Are you with Uther, or are you with me? Are you prepared to help me bring about his downfall? I am. I can't tell you how much it means to hear you say that. Good morning, my lady. Did you sleep well? Better than you by, the looks of it. Sorry. I have court business that needs attending to. You have to stay in bed, Sire. You have a fever. I'll prepare a tonic. When did he first fall ill? It came on this morning. It's not something to worry about? It'll soon pass. Be sure to let me know if there's any change. - What's that noise? - What noise? A sort of trembling sound. That's your knees knocking together. I fear this contagion is spreading. You're the fifth person today. It's nothing. Damn! I'll pick that up later. I think I might need a little something myself. If I can ever find what it is I'm looking for. Seems part of Joseph's story was true. Probably just travellers passing through. Or maybe not. Run, Merlin! Will you do as I say! What happened to your arm? - Must have caught it on something. - Let me see. Your first battle wound. Here. - No, don't... You'll ruin it! - Don't worry. You can mend it. Did anyone else escape? We need to get back to Camelot. Gather reinforcements. Are they dead? No. They're breathing. What's happened to them? I don't know. What's going on? I'll get Gaius. They're all fast asleep. - It must be some kind of sickness. - Where's my father? Where is he? It must be the work of magic. We have to find my father. It's me, Morgana. What's happened? - I didn't know it was you. - Calm down, Morgana. Tell me what happened. People were complaining, saying they weren't feeling well. And then? They started falling asleep. - Everyone. Everywhere I went. - Was someone here? - Then why were you hiding? - I told you I didn't know who you were. Where's my father? - I don't know. - She's distressed! If she was awake, then she must've seen something. I saw nothing. You saw people getting sick. What did you do? - What could I do? - I don't understand. Why is it that you're the only person awake? Don't worry, I won't say anything. - About what? - The illness. - That has nothing to do with me. - No, but you have magic. - You haven't told anyone that? - No. I won't tell Arthur, but... There must be something keeping you safe. And I think that must be it. Right. I've found him! - Father! - See, he's all right. - He is not all right! - He's just asleep. All we have to do is find a cure, a way to wake them. Who could have done this? You're the only one not affected. There must be a reason. - I don't know. - That's all you keep saying. You must know something. They just fell asleep, one by one! It's obvious. When she started feeling sick, Gaius gave her a potion, right? When was she sick? She never said that. She was one of the last to be affected. Somehow the potion must've helped. What about everyone else? Gaius was too ill. He didn't have the chance to treat anyone else. Go and see if you can find this potion. I'll search for signs of life. Morgana, you stay here and look after my father. Keep him safe. Here. Protect him with your life, you understand? All right. Gaius, this is going to wake you. All right... We can try this. Well, maybe not. Come on, Gaius. I need you to wake up. I really need your help. Here we go. Come quickly! According to the legend, there were only 7 Knights of Medhir. - Then who's the extra rider? - I don't know. But Camelot is defenceless. We have to get back to my father. This will be the first place they look. We have to hide him. - What's going on? - We're under attack. No time to explain. Grab his legs, carry him. Don't sweep the floor with him! - Pick his feet up. - His feet aren't the problem. Give him a hand. It is not funny, Merlin. Did you find the potion? We can't leave him. We have to lift him onto the bed. Why? He's asleep. He's not going to know. Well... I'll get him a pillow. He's the King! All right, two pillows. Are you all right? You feeling the same? We're getting sick. We can't let that happen. We must keep my father hidden. Why don't we disguise him? - That might work. - We could dress him as a woman. That, on the other hand... - And as a servant? - That's better. I'll get him some clothes. Are you all right, Morgana? You seem quiet. I'm fine. Are you sure? I can always tell when you're lying. Don't worry. I won't let any harm come to him. What's going on? Why is everyone asleep? Please, not you as well. I need your help. What am I going to do? Don't pretend. I know you're listening to me. I don't need to listen to you. You always say the same thing. "Help me!" And yet you refuse to give anything in return. Now you will face the consequence of that decision. Camelot's end is nigh and there's nothing you can do about it. I know, I promised to free you. And I will. I will, I promise! I no longer trust your promises. I swear on my mother's life. Careful what you say. You have to help me. Please! Her life matters more to you than your own. This is an oath I believe you will honour. I will. It is one thing to cast a spell that puts everyone to sleep. The power to maintain it is a very different matter. It will need more than just words to break this enchantment. - What do you mean? - You must... eradicate the source, Merlin. - Great, what is that? - Not what, but who. Such spells need a vessel, a constant living presence to give them strength. The source of this pestilence is the witch, the Lady Morgana. - It can't be. - I have warned you about her in the past, but you have failed to take heed. She is dangerous. And now she has chosen to turn her back on her own. How do I stop her? That is easy, young warlock. You must kill her. The spell is woven with magic of such power that even you are not immune. You must act now, before it's too late. If you do not, then Camelot will fall and Arthur will die. And the future you were destined to share will die with you. What took you so long? I didn't know Uther's size. I was worried about you. They're here in the castle. - Where's Arthur? - He's gone to find somewhere safe. Thank you for not saying anything. That's all right. You're a good friend. We have to move my father before Morgause gets here. Come on, let's go. You're not surprised? No, I am not. We should be safe in here for a while. It must be the potion Gaius gave her. Yeah, must be the potion. We can't keep this up much longer. I know. We're in a servant's quarters. If we leave him here, - they'll think he's a servant. - Not if Morgause sees him. We need to get him out of Camelot. When we arrived, there was a cart in the main square. Remember? You are full of good ideas today. You go and look. We won't make it to the cart. Not carrying Uther. That's why we've made this. We're going to pull him. Get down and keep quiet. Protect the King, get him out of here! Please! Help me. We need the remedy that Gaius gave you. - I don't have it. - I know that. But you must remember what it was. What was in it? Come on, we can't keep going much longer. - Think! - Sorry... We can't get it, anyway. We're trapped. There has to be something we can do! Why didn't that knight kill you? How do I know? Because I'm a woman? Maybe. Unless we can rid ourselves of this, I don't see how we can hold out. We have to destroy the source of the magic. Which is...? I don't know. Then our only chance is to get out of Camelot. Help me with my father. Cut the blanket up, we'll tie it to my father and we'll lower him onto the cart. Please, just do as I say. I'll fetch the cart round to the window. You're going out there? I'll come with you. You stay, you protect my father. - You won't reach the cart alone. - We have no choice. - How are you feeling? - Not bad. - You sure? - Yeah. You? Never better. Get me a pillow. Don't mess around. You need to stay awake. That's better. If you ever do that again... Well, don't fall asleep, then! That your knees again? - If I need a servant in a next life... - Don't ask me. He's not going to survive. I know. We've got to do something. I know. You tear this up. I'll make some rope. Here, have some water. I'm not thirsty. If we get out of here, you couldn't drink. If we get out of here. Here. I'm fine. You have some before I finish it. Thank you. What has he done to you? I had to. You poisoned her! You gave me no choice. Tell me what you used and I can save her. First, stop the attack. You're nothing but a simple servant. You don't tell me what to do. If you want to know what poison it is, you will undo the magic. - Tell me the poison or you'll die. - Then she'll die with me. I don't want this any more than you. But you give me no choice. Stop the knights and you can save her. - What have you done with my father? - He's safe. Keep away from her. I couldn't find you. Are you all right? Is there still no sign of her? We've looked, Father. Morgause must not be allowed to get away with this! Yes, Father. I haven't had a chance to say thank you. I failed, Father. I should have protected Morgana. That was my duty. Her loss will be on my conscience, not yours. You did the right thing. You don't mean that. Morgana was your friend, too. You cared about her. I did. I fear that, unlike you, Morgana chose not to use her gift for good. You had no choice. Would we be sitting here now if you had not made that decision? Where are you going? I'll eat that later. There's something I have to do. You must steal a sword from the Knights of Medhir.</i> Their blades were forged by the Old Religion.</i> If you harness its power to your own,</i> you will have the strength to break the chains</i> with which Uther Pendragon keeps me prisoner.</i> The time has come, young warlock. Where will you go? I am the last of my kind. There is but one road I can take. - What does that mean? - You will see. Before I do this, you promise me that you will not harm Camelot. I think there have been
