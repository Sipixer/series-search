He cannot glimpse his part in the great story that is about to unfold. Like everyone, he must live and learn. And so it will be for the young warlock arriving at the gates of Camelot. A boy that will, in time, father a legend. His name... .. Merlin Merlin 2008 1x01 The call of the Dragon Let this serve as a lesson to all. This man, Thomas James Collins, is adjudged guilty of conspiring to use enchantments and magic. And pursuant to the laws of Camelot, I, Uther Pendragon, have decreed that such practices are banned on penalty of death. I pride myself as a fair and just king. But for the crime of sorcery, there is but one sentence I can pass. When I came to this land, this kingdom was mired in chaos. With the people's help, magic was driven from the realm. So I declare a festival to celebrate 20 years since the great dragon was captured and Camelot freed from the evil of sorcery. Let the celebrations begin. There is only one evil in this land and it is not magic. It is you... ...with your hatred and your ignorance. You took my son! And I promise you, before these celebrations are over, you will share my tears. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. A son for a son. Seize her. Where would I find Gaius, the court physician? Hello? Hello? Gaius? Whoa! What the... What did you just do? Um... Tell me. Well, uh... I have no idea what happened. If anyone had seen that... No, that was nothing to do with me. I know what it was. I want to know where you learnt it. Nowhere. How do you know magic? I don't. Where did you study? Answer me! I've never studied magic or been taught. Are you lying? What do you want me to say? The truth. I was born like this. That's impossible. Who are you? Oh, uh... I have this letter. I... I don't have my glasses. I'm Merlin Hunith's son? Yes. You're not meant to be here till Wednesday. It is Wednesday. Ah. Right, then. You better put your bag in there. Look, you won't say anything about... No. Though, Merlin.. I should say thank you. My dear, Gaius, I turn to you for I feel lost and alone and don't know who to trust. It is every mother's fate to think her child is special. Yet I would give my life that Merlin were not. Ours is a small village and he is so clearly at odds with people here that if he were to remain, I fear what will become of him. He needs a hand to hold, a voice to guide. Someone that might help him find a purpose for his gifts. I beg you, if you understand a mother's love for her son, keep him safe. And may God save you both. Morgana Yes? What is this? Why are you not joining us? I don't think chopping someone's head off is cause for a celebration. That poor mother. Simple justice for what he'd done. To whom? He practised magic. He didn't hurt anyone. You were not around 20 years ago. You have no idea what it was like. How long are you going to keep punishing people for what happened then? Until they realize there is no room for magic in my kingdom. You will be with me when I greet Lady Helen. I told you - I want no part of this. I am your guardian. I expect you to do as I ask. If you show me no respect, at least respect our finest singer. You know the more brutal you are, the more enemies you create. Hello? Gregory? Lady Helen. Is all well? Yes. With luck, we should reach Camelot late tomorrow. That's good. I'll be outside if you need me. Who's there? Who's there? Merlin Merlin I got you water. You didn't wash last night. Sorry. Help yourself to breakfast. How did you do that? Did you incant a spell in your mind? I don't know any spells. So what did you do? There must be something. It just happened. Well, we better keep you out of trouble. You can help me until I find some paid work for you. Here. Hollyhock and feverfew for Lady Percival and this is for Sir Olwen. He's blind as a weevil, so warn him not to take it all at once. - Ok - And here. Off you go. And Merlin, I need hardly tell you, that the practice of any form of enchantments will get you killed. Um... I brought you your medicine. Oh, Gaius said don't drink it all... I'm sure it's fine. Where's the target? There, sir? That's into the sun. It's not that bright. A bit like you, then. Put the target down the other end, shall I, sir? Teach him a lesson. This'll teach him. Teach him a lesson. Hey, hang on. Don't stop. Here? I told you to keep moving. Come on! Run. We want some moving target practice. Hey. Come on, that's enough. - What? - You've had your fun, my friend. Do I know you? I'm Merlin So I don't know you. - No. - Yet you called me friend. That was my mistake. - I think so. - Yeah. I'd never have a friend who could be such an ass. Or I one who could be so stupid. Tell me Merlin, do you know how to walk on your knees? No. Would you like me to help you? I wouldn't if I were you. Why? What are you gonna do to me? You have no idea. Be my guest. Come on. Come on! Come on. I'll throw you in jail for that. Do you think you're the king? No, I'm his son - Arthur. Lady Helen. Thank you so much for coming to sing at our celebrations. Pleasure's all mine. How was your journey? The time it took. Well, it was worth the wait. It will be. Merlin Merlin Merlin Merlin G... Uh. You never cease to amaze me. The one thing that someone like you should do is keep your head down. What do you do? You bahave like an idiot. I'm sorry. You're lucky. I managed to pull a few strings to get you released. Oh, thank you, thank you! I won't forget this. Well, there is a small price to pay. Oh, God! Thanks. I'm Guinevere, but most people call me Gwen. I'm the Lady Morgana's maid. Right. I'm Merlin Although most people just call me "idiot". No, no. I saw what you did. You were so brave. Or stupid. I'm glad you walked away. You weren't going to beat him. - All right, i can beat him - You think? Because you don't look like one of these big muscly fellows. Thanks. I'm sure you're stronger than you look. It's just Arthur's one of these real rough, tough, save-the-world kind of men. And... well... What? You don't look like that. I'm in disguise. It's great you stood up to him. You think so? Arthur's a bully and everyone thought you were a real hero. Really? Mm-hm. Oh, excuse me, Guinevere. My fans are waiting. Want some vegetables with that? I know you're still angry with me. Your mother asked me to look after you. Yes. What did your mother say to you about your gifts? That I was special. You are special, the likes of which I have never seen before. What do you mean? Well, magic requires incantations, spells, it takes years to study. What I saw you do was... elemental, instinctive. What's the point if it can't be used? That I do not know. You are a question that has never been posed before, Merlin Did you ever study magic? Uther banned all such work 20 years ago. Why? People used magic for the wrong end at that time. It threw the natural order into chaos. Uther made it his mission to destroy every things from back then. Even the dragons. All of them? There was one dragon he chose not to kill. Kept it as an example. He imprisoned it in a cave deep beneath the castle where no one can free it. Now eat up. When you finish, you'll take a preparation to Lady Helen. She needs it for her voice. What are you doing in here? Um... I was... I was asked to deliver this. How's your knee-walking coming along? Oh, don't run away! From you? Ah, thank God. Thought you were deaf as well as dumb. Look, I've told you you're an ass. I just didn't realise you're a royal one. Oh. What are you going to do? You got your daddy's men to protect you? I could take you apart with one blow. I could take you apart with less than that. - You sure? - Come on. Here you go, big man. Come on, then. I warn you. I've been trained to kill since birth. Wow. And how long have you been training to be a prat? You can't address me like that. Sorry. How long have you been training to be a prat... My Lord? Come on, then, Merlin! Come on! You're in trouble now. Oh, God. Want to give up? Do you? Do you? Do you want to give up? Wait. Let him go. He may be an idiot, but he's a brave one. There's something about you, Merlin I can't quite put my finger on it. How could you be so foolish?! He needed to be told a lesson. Magic must be studied, mastered and used for good. Not for idiotic pranks! What is it to master? I could move objects like that before I could talk! You should control yourself. I don't want to! If I can't use magic, what have I got? I'm just a nobody. And who always will be. If I can't use magic, I might as well die. Merlin? Sit up. Take your shirt off. You don't know why I was born like this, do you? No. I'm not a monster, am I? Don't ever think that. Then why am I like this? Please. I need to know why. Maybe there's someone with more knowledge than me. If you can't tell me, no-one can. Take this. It will help with the pain. Will you sing for me tonight? You will have to wait. You will not deny me. I'm saving myself for my performance tomorrow. Will everyone be there? Who would dare to miss it? How about your son? It seems a shame not to have met him. That's Arthur. Poor child. Hmm? Poor child. It can't have been easy to grow up without a mother. No. Hmm. That bond between mother and son - it's so hard to replace. Hasn't been easy. I'm sure. Perhaps if you found someone. If you remarried. I'm sure you'd have the pick of any maiden in the kingdom. Well, perhaps I'll find love again. But I'm afraid it's too late to replace Arthur's mother. Yes. It's certainly too late for Arthur. Merlin Merlin Merlin Merlin Merlin Merlin Where are you? I'm here. How small you are for such a great destiny. Why? What do you mean? What destiny? Your gift, Merlin, was given to you for a reason. So there is a reason. Arthur is the once and future king who will unite the land of Albion. Right... But he faces many threats from friend and foe alike. I don't see what this has to do with me? Everything! Without you, Arthur will never succeed. Without you, there will be no Albion. No. No, you've got this wrong. There is no right or wrong. Only what is and what isn't. I serious. If anyone wants to go and kill him, then go ahead. In fact I give them a hand. None of us can choose our destiny, Merlin And none of us can escape it. No. No way, no. There must be another Arthur because this one's an idiot. Perhaps it's your destiny to change that. Wa... Wait. Wait. Stop. I need to know more! Hoy! Have you seen the state of this room? I... It just happens. By magic? Yeah. Yes. Well, you can clear it up without magic. Then I want you toget me some herbs. Henbane, wormwood and sorrel. And deliver this to Morgana. Poor girl's suffering from nightmares. I know the feeling. You know, I've been thinking about Arthur. I wouldn't touch him with a lance pole. Pass me that dress, will you, Gwen? I mean, the man's a total jouster. Just because I'm the King's ward, that doesn't mean I have to accompany him to the feast, does it? Well, does it? Mm-mm. If he wants me to go, then he should invite me. He hasn't. Know what that means? Mm-mm. Where are you? Here. It means I'm going by myself. I need some help with this fastening. Gwen? I'm here. So, it's whether I wear this little tease... ...or give them a night they'll really remember. Lady Helen, the compliments of the king. Come in. So sweet. How will I ever repay him? Whe  he hears you sing that will be more than enough, won't it? I'm really looking forward to the performance. So am I. I love singing. I sing all the time. My betrothed says I have the voice of a fallen angel. God have mercy. Merlin! Remember you're here to work. She looks great, doesn't she? Some people are born to be queen. No. I hope so, one day. Not that I'd want to be her. Who'd want to marry Arthur? I thought you liked tough, save-the-world men. No, I like ordinary men like you. Gwen, believe me, I'm not ordinary. No, I didn't mean you! Obviously. Not YOU. But just... you know, I like much more ordinary men. Like you. Thanks. We have enjoyed 20 years of peace and prosperity. It has brought the kingdom and myself many pleasures. But few can compare with the honour of introducing Lady Helen of Mora. You saved my boy's life. - A debt must be repaid. - Oh... well... Don't be modest. You'll be rewarded. You don't have to. No, absolutely. This merits something quite special. You'll get a post in the royal household. You shall be Prince Arthur's manservant. Father?! Seems you're a hero. Hard to believe, isn't it? No. I knew from the moment I met you. You saved my life, remember? But... that was magic. And now it seems we've finally found a use for it. - What do you mean? - I saw how you saved Arthur's life. Perhaps that's its purpose. My destiny. Indeed. This book was given to me when I was your age. But I have a feeling it will be of more use to you than it was to me. But this is a book of magic. Which is why you must keep it hidden. I will study every word. Merlin, Prince Arthur wants you right away. Your destiny's calling.
