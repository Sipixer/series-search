rests on the shoulders of a young boy. His name... Merlin. If he's not better in the morning, let me know. She's a prey to a bounty hunter. She's only a girl! She'll still fetch a good price though. Someone'll pay for her? Uther offers a handsome reward for anyone with magic. There must be something we can do? Bounty hunters are dangerous men, they are not to be meddled with. You of all people should understand that. Don't worry, I won't hurt you. He won't find you here. Here. Sorry... Sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you. I just thought you might be cold. - Why did you do that? - What? Help me. I saw you and... It could have been me in that cage. You'll be safe down here. I'll come back in the morning with some food and candles. Will you be all right till then? I'm Merlin, by the way. I'm Freya. I'll see you in the morning. Thank you. Breakfast! Where's the meat, cheese? That's the new breakfast menu. - This isn't enough. - We've got to get you in shape. - I'm fighting fit. - And we want to keep you that way. - Is there somewhere you have to be? - Of course not. Good! Because I've some chores for you to do. Make sure it's hot enough. - Is it ready? - Yeah. Freshly heated. - You bumpkin! It's boiling! - Boiling? - You're half asleep today. - Sorry, Sire. I'll get you some cold. No, I'll get you some. That woken you up? Raring to go, Sire. Halig. You come bearing gifts? Yes, Sire. A druid girl... But she escaped last night, here in Camelot. Don't worry, we'll soon find her. Have some guards help with the search. You need to warn them, Sire. The girl is dangerous. My informer told me she was cursed. - How so? - He didn't know. He said even the druids were frightened of her. They cast her out of their camp. It is against all the druids believe to reject those in need of care. Why would they do such a thing? I dread to think. Set up sentries on all the gates. We should search the lower town, Sire. Someone may harbour her. - She had help? - I saw two figures running away. Give Halig all the help he needs. I want this girl and her accomplice found. Get in line! Move along. Hurry up. It's all right. It's OK. It's me. It's Merlin. And look... It's good. Believe me, it's fit for a prince. Is that a druid symbol? - Were you born a druid? - Why are you asking me these questions? I didn't mean to. - I'm sorry. - I understand. You could never understand. I know what it's like to keep secrets. - Does anyone know you have magic? - Only you. And one other person. He knows but I'm not sure he understands. I wish I was like everyone else. But... You always know deep down you're not. - Because I'm cursed. - Freya, don't say that. Magic doesn't have to be a curse. It can be a gift. Look. Beautiful. I have to go, someone might notice I'm missing. But I'll come back. I'll bring you some more food. I promise. - Do you know anything about the girl? - What girl? The girl from the cage. She escaped last night. - Good. I'm pleased. - They're out hunting for her. - Why can't they just let her be? - Did you help her escape? You told me not to get involved. Promise me you had nothing to do with this? Good. Because when Halig finds out who helped her, I wouldn't want to be in their shoes. Would you like some water with that? - I had two drumsticks. - No, you didn't. - Merlin, I had two drumsticks. - Maybe it fell on the floor. I had sausages. You sure? They must've fallen. - Merlin! - What? - You can search me, I haven't them. - Where have they gone? - Strange. - Very! - Sure you didn't eat them? - I haven't had the chance! It's just the Prince's leftovers. - Does he know you steal his food? - Not exactly. - Where were you taking it? - Home. For my dinner. Really? The druid girl I'm looking for. Have you seen her? You know how much she's worth? More than your life. So I'm asking you again. Have you seen the druid girl? Hold him. - You're lying to me. - No. I don't believe you. What do you think you're doing? We caught the boy behaving suspiciously, Sire. He could be harbouring the girl. And he's going to tell us where. Leave him alone! Merlin is my servant. He has my absolute trust. If you've a problem with him, you come to me. Do you understand? Goodnight, Merlin. Don't forget your dinner. Thank you. Are those my sausages? - You took them? - To keep you in shape. You say I'm fat? Not yet. I am not fat! See, it's working. I'm sorry I took so long. You must be hungry. - What? - Nothing. - But you're upset. - No. Did you think I wasn't coming? I promised you I would. I scare most people away. I'm not most people. - How long had you been in that cage? - A few days. - The bounty hunter. - Halig. How did he find you? - You can't always trust people. - I know. That's why I left home. - Where is home? - Ealdor. It's a small village. A few fields, a couple of cows. Nothing special. My home was next to a lake, surrounded by the tallest mountains. In winter the storms whipped up the water into waves. And you thought they were going to crash down and take all the houses away. But in the summer, wild flowers, and the light... - It was like heaven. - Sounds perfect. It was. Was? My family died. Have you been on your own ever since? You're not on your own any more. I'm going to look after you, - I promise. - You can't look after me. No-one can. You don't understand. I've never known anyone like you. - I wish I could stay. - You're going? We need to be careful. I'll come back in the morning. You know I will be back? I've never known anyone like you either. They've been killed by some kind of wild animal. Have your men been able to track the creature? That's the strange thing. Because the ground is soft. A bear or a wolf would leave some mark. - But no tracks. - What are these? Human footprints. Did somebody escape the attack? - No-one has come forward. - Could the person who made these... - be responsible? - I don't believe so. These wounds could have been inflicted by a beast of considerable size. And if this was done by neither a man nor a beast, there is only one explanation. It must be the work of a magical creature. I know... I'm late again. I'm sorry, but... This is going to be the best bread you have ever tasted. What do you want with it? Come on, you can have anything. Ham, cheese... Strawberries. Strawberries it is. - That's not a strawberry. - It's the right colour. Why are you so good to me? Because... I can't help it. Wasn't I? I like you. With you, I can just be who I am. We don't have to hide anything. We don't have to worry. Merlin, please. Listen to me. I'm not like you. They must've followed me. They're going to find me. I can't go back in that cage, I can't. I won't let that happen. I promised you I'd look after you and I will. No matter what. You really don't realize how special you are, do you? You're not scared of me? Being different is nothing to be scared of. Stop that! - What? - Sit down and eat your soup. - Sorry. - What is wrong with you? Nothing. - I feel great. - Good. You can get on with some chores. Chores? Unless you've got something better to do? Sorry, I'm going out. What time will you be back? Don't wait up for me, I might be late. - What're you doing here? - I couldn't help it. - It's dangerous. - I don't care. You have to be careful. I'm fed up with being careful. I'm fed up with all of these. So I've decided I'm going to get you out of here. - Out of Camelot. - How? I'll get you some clothes. Disguise you. What's wrong? It's just... I'll miss you. No, you won't. - Because I'll come with you. - What? I told you, I'm going to look after you. You can't. Don't say that. - It's not what you want? - Merlin, you have a good life here My life is... I have to keep moving. Always looking over my shoulder. People chasing me. Then we'll go somewhere no-one knows us. Somewhere far away. You haven't given me your answer. I want that more than anything. Where will we go? - Somewhere with mountains. - A few fields. - Wild flowers. - And a couple of cows. And a lake. And a lake. I'm sure there's an explanation. - There is. - Which is? - Moths. - Moths? The castle's overrun with them. Really? I was checking if they'd got in here. Have they? Totally infested. I'll have to burn it. Burn it? If we don't stop them, we'll all be walking around naked. - What're you doing? - Running an errand for Gaius. For Gaius? Strange. It's not for him. It's only you do a decent day's work. That's what i care about. No, it's not for me. What a man does in his spare time is completely up to him. - No, you've got this wrong. - Colour suits you, Merlin. - The beast has struck again? - I'm afraid so. Their wounds match those of the previous victims. The men who saw it spoke of a huge black cat with wings. I was right. This is not a natural creature. - Are there any tracks? - Human footprints again. Can you identify this monster? I will need more time to investigate. You always have a theory. This time, Sire, I prefer to wait until I'm certain. There is no time to waste. I will report back to you before the day is out. Believe me, it was not easy... getting this. It's beautiful. You look like a princess. I'm not. I can't take this. I don't understand. You keep doing all this for me. I don't deserve it. - I want to. What's wrong? - Nothing. Here... Please. You'll look wonderful in it. We can leave tonight. And we'll be together. We'll need supplies. Food, water. All right. I'll try to get horses and we'll need blankets, but... that's all we'll need. - Go on, go. - I won't be long. Goodbye, Merlin. - Gaius, I was just... - Merlin, sit down. I want to talk to you. Is everything all right? You look worried. The beast struck again last night. - There have been two more deaths. - Do you know what it is? There were no tracks around the bodies, but human footprints lead away from them. It doesn't seem to add up. The footprints indicate a human is responsible. Yet the wounds inflicted are definitely the work of a beast. Strange. Until I remembered what Halig said about the druid girl. That she's cursed. What's that got to do? Ancient chronicles speak of a heinous curse. It dooms its victim to turn at the stroke of midnight, into a vicious and bloodthirsty beast. The writers of old called this creature a bastet, a monster of nightmare that inhabits the twilight world between the living and the dead I want the truth, Did you release the druid girl from the cage? Of course not! There was a time when you thought twice before lying. I did what was right. You know the creature and the girl are one and the same. You're wrong. Freya is just a girl. Please, think about what I'm saying. You know it is the truth. Where is she now? She's already killed and she'll kill again. - She can't stop herself. - Please, Gaius. - Where are you going? - To Uther. I beg you. Just give me some time to get her out of the city. Please. I'm sorry. I can't let more innocent people die. I had no choice. Uther had to be told. They won't find her. She's gone. I'm sorry. I do understand how you must feel. You could never understand. Do you know how it feels... to be a monster? To be afraid of who you are? Freya is very different from you. She's dangerous. Whatever she is and has done, she doesn't deserve to die. I just hope she's safe. Somewhere far away. There she is!. Stop! Please, let me go. No-one escapes from me. You're all right, you're safe now. You must hate me. I'm a monster. I tried to tell you. I know. I wasn't always like this. You shouldn't try to talk. There was a man. He attacked me. I didn't mean to hurt him, but I thought he was going to kill me. - It was an accident. - But his mother was a sorceress. When she found out, said I'd killed her son, she cursed me to kill forever more. I'm going to make you better. The wound is too deep. Please go. I'm not leaving you here. You remembered. Of course. I'm so sorry for what that sorcerer did to you. You have nothing to be sorry for. There must be something I can do. Some way to save you. You've already saved me. You made me feel loved. I don't want you to go. One day, Merlin, I will repay you. I promise. I was so worried. I'm sorry, Gaius. Where's the girl? She's gone. She's dead. I'm sorry, Merlin. Truly I am. I've been looking for you. You're going to ask me to polish your armour and to wash your clothes and clean your room. Something's been upsetting you, hasn't it? Maybe. Was it when I threw water over you? That wasn't very nice. It was a bit unfair. Like you calling me fat. - Why was that unfair? - Because I'm not... Still think I need to get in shape? - That's better. - Thanks. You are right, though. You need to polish my armour, wash my clothes and clean my room. Sleep well, Prince Arthur. When you'll wake, may your thoughts be only of Vivian. My job is to woo. - He's enchanted. - Yes, with Lady Vivian. I can see that. Unhand her
