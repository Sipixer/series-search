rests on the shoulders of a young boy. His name... Merlin. We're not going into battle. Don't look so sombre. Never before have the rulers of the five kingdoms come together in this way. Never before have we all worked towards the same aim, towards peace. If these talks are successful, Camelot will enter a new era of prosperity. If they fail, it will almost certainly mean war. Boy! Is it too much to ask that you might anticipate my needs? Sorry, master. I was... - Stop whinging. - Sorry, master. Alined! You are most welcome on this momentous occasion. Momentous? Let us hope so. Uther may think that we are gathered here for peace, but that is far from my mind. Am I to take it that Lady Vivian is part of our plan? She is very lovely. Don't let her father hear you. Not if you value your head. Indeed I do! It is my prettiest feature. Olaf is the most over-protective buffoon I've ever met. It would surely end the peace talks if anyone were to lay a finger on her. But nobody in their right mind would do that. But Arthur won't be in his right mind... will he? Arthur's Knights Merlin - 2x10 Sweet Dreams What kind of welcome is this? You have us hanging around like the last swallows of summer. You are welcome indeed, Olaf. May I present my daughter, the Lady Vivian. How like your mother you are. I hope everything is to your satisfaction? It is adequate. Most of our guests are extremely happy here. I am sure you will be too. I am not most of your guests. In... deed. Well, may I present Guinevere? She'll be looking after you for the duration of your stay. You will want for nothing. She is truly one of Camelot's finest. Then I fear for Camelot. Good luck with that one. I need to prepare for the feast. What kind of impression this gives? That we have moths. Fetch me another. And who might you be trying to impress? Well, let me see... Perhaps the five kings sitting in the banquet hall below. Not the king's daughter, then? The Lady Vivian, she is very beautiful. Anyone trying to impress the Lady Vivian does so at extreme peril. Olaf would have their head in a vat of hot oil before they'd said hello. Besides, she's not my type. She may be beautiful but she's incredibly rude. You should've heard what she said to Gwen. Anyone insulting Gwen should do so at extreme peril. What? Nothing. I just know how you feel about her, that's all. That is, if your feelings haven't changed. I presume they haven't. I do have my own vat of hot oil, you know. You're blushing. No, I'm not. - What's wrong with Gwen? - Nothing. I think she is very worthy of your love. Indeed. Were it so. Which is. Get out. But it is not enough to please just the gentlemen of the court. Now I have a spectacle for the ladies. - It is skill indeed. - We aim to please. But what is this? It has mistaken you for a beautiful flower. Sleep well, Prince Arthur, and when you wake, may your thoughts be only of Vivian. Sweet dreams. Good morning. Never have you been more right! It is the sunniest, the most fragrant, the most... beautiful morning I've ever seen in my life. You're dressed? I am the future King of Camelot, I do have some skills. Indeed. You are very skilled... at getting people to do things for you. That is your job. But today my job... is to woo. - To what? - To woo. I wish to make a proclamation of love. Really? I thought you wanted to keep your feelings secret. Why would I do that? By the end of today, I will have won my lady. Right. - What will you tell your father? - What does he matter? That's one way of approaching things. I need your help in expressing my feelings. Of course. - How do I express my feelings? - Oh, I see. - Feelings... - Feelings. - Girls... - Girls. - Flowers? - Excellent. Find some. - Perhaps you should also send a note. - Brilliant idea. Something moving. Something from the heart. Something... You'll think of something. "The barriers that keep us apart "are nothing compared to the power of true love." "Arthur." Your demands are noted and will be taken into consideration in due course. In the meantime, is there anyone else who has comments about the Northern Territories? Maybe I should point out that... Did you do it? Left them in her room. It's better than a public display. - You sure she got them? - I'm sure she will. Good! Well, all we can do now is wait... But heaven has blessed me. She's even more beautiful than before. Don't you agree? I'm surprised to hear you talk so openly. Nonsense. I want to tell the world. I want to... shout it across the kingdom. Sure that's a good idea? I understand your feelings but other people may object. Object? - To what? - You're the future King of Camelot and she is serving girl, albeit a very nice serving girl. Lady Vivian is of royal blood, a future queen. I will have your head if I hear such insolence again. Merlin, can't you knock? - Rats. - What? Big, hairy, sharp teeth. Yeah, definitely, under here. - Are you feeling all right? - Me? Never better. You? I'm having a very surprising day. Really? You know when you've lost all hope and then out of the blue something happens to restore your faith. Sort of. Well, that's what's happened to me today. I may have caused a problem. Although it wasn't entirely my doing. - What now, Merlin? - Arthur's in love. How did you cause that? That bit isn't my fault. The other is. I can't tell you about that bit. Clear as mud. Arthur is besotted. He can't concentrate on anything. All he thinks about, all he talks about is... It's the Lady Vivian. The Lady Vivian? How could that happened so suddenly? I don't know. Something doesn't feel right. Only yesterday, he dismissed her as rude. If Arthur professes his love for Vivian, Olaf will be furious. Surely Arthur knows that? He said it was his job to woo his lady by the end of the day. It is your job to stop him. - Who is it? - It is destiny, my love. Destiny and chicken. What a beautiful combination? The beans are a little cold, but the meat is very good. Go away. My love, what I have done to offend you? Your love? Not now, nor ever. Come now. My father will kill you if he finds you here. Your father does not worry me. You won't say that when he's running at you with a knife. - I've seen it before. - Really? - Just five minutes? - My lord. Your advances are not welcome. Go away, and take your chicken with you! I don't know what gives you that impression. Damn it! Every woman in the land is attracted to this boy. I'm almost attracted to him myself. Not Lady Vivian. We have until the end of tomorrow to scupper these talks. I need war. Do you understand? Oh, yes, I do. Peace will make me poor. And you know what happens to poor kings? They can't afford castles... or knights, or jesters. - But Master... - Enough. There will be time for snivelling when the axe is over your head. Now there is work to be done. Go on, Merlin, say it. What? You do not think I should pursue my love. I think a number of things stand in the way of a happy union between you and Lady Vivian. Her blood-thirsty father for one. Her complete lack of interest for another. Might it be worthwhile returning to your old love? I have my reservations about that as well. What are you talking about? I don't have an old love. What on Earth...? You really need to start paying attention to the details. I knew something wasn't right. Arthur's enchanted. I should've realised. No-one can make butterflies appear from thin air. Trickler. Why'd he want Arthur to love her? An advance by Arthur would ruin the conference. - Maybe Alined wants war. - Without creating it himself. It is the cowardly behaviour you would expect from him. Cowardly, but clever. We need to find a way of turning Arthur back to normal. Before it's too late. My love... Breakfast. There are over 636 love spells in these books, and over 150 of them involve a lock of hair. Is there no way we can narrow them down a bit? I have. Look. If I choose this one and it's wrong, Arthur will end up as a toad. And if this one's wrong, Vivian will lose all her hair. Olaf might not declare war for that, but she certainly would! Gwen has been detained. I thought you might appreciate breakfast. Thank you. How kind! I'm so happy this morning I could forget to eat. But that looks wonderful. Really wonderful. Pray, my lady. What has caused such happiness? I cannot tell, so do not ask. Intriguing... You know another meaning of jester is "keeper of secrets". - Really? - No. You mustn't tell. Not a soul. - Especially not my father. - Go on... I am in love. How wonderful. With me? With a man more courageous than a lion, stronger than an ox, and so perfectly formed it is as if he had been sculpted by the gods themselves. But it must be me? Just to speak his name brings me pleasure indeed. Then speak it you should. There! I've said it. My heart belongs to Arthur. Excellent. In fact, I'm going to tell him now. A brilliant idea. Where is Gwen? I must dress. But you look so beautiful, my lady. How could he refuse you like this? - In my night gown? - Why not? What is it, Arthur? You look like you have something on your mind. You read me like a book. I have made a fool of myself, that's all. That is... everything. I'm sure that is not true. You have a good heart, Guinevere, but I'm afraid it is. I have made... a gesture, and it was not well received. You're sure? Pretty sure. Then you are wrong. You are very close to the lady in question. Your token was much appreciated. But the situation is delicate and... it is not always easy to express what is really in one's heart. There's hope? There is always hope. If only I had some way of knowing. Indeed, my lord. I wish to see Arthur. Your master. - My lord. - Your what? My heart's delight. Where is he? He's not here. Which is a very good thing, I believe. - Then I shall wait. - I don't think that's a good idea. You're not even dressed. My love does not care what I wear, only that I am near. - Now fetch him. - I cannot. - You will. - I shan't. - As he commands you, I command you. - I am asking you to leave. I want my love. I need my love. I want to see him now. And so moving on to our final point for discussion, the boundaries of the Eastern Territories. This is a point that I am willing to concede. That is very generous. - Excuse me, sire? - One moment. What?! Where is he? What's that? Okay, you need to go. You cannot keep us apart. It is written in the stars. Vivian and Arthur, a love for all time. A love stronger than time! A love... Why are you hanging around like a bad smell? It's me who needs to bathe. I'm not going to win my love stinking like an old kipper. No, my lord. Where is she? I know she's in here, Arthur! Hand her over or feel my wrath. What's he talking about? She wasn't even dressed. If I have dishonoured you in some way, then by all means, provide me with proof and I'll face the consequences. Trickler here tells me the Lady Vivian is in your chambers. If only that were true. If only that were true, you would not look so foolish. Search the room. You'd better hope I don't find her. That hasn't opened in years. Buffoon! You've made an idiot of me. I am... so terribly sorry, to have disturbed you. I do hope that you will forgive me. Check on the Lady Vivian, and remain outside her room! If only the Lady Vivian were in my room. How delightful that would be. It's that meddlesome Merlin. He's onto us, my lord. There was nothing I could do. You do understand, master? Say you forgive your boy? You have a matter of hours before the peace treaty is signed. That is time enough, master. Time enough. It's less time than you've had already, and you haven't managed it so far. But the enchantment is strong, my lord. Sooner or later, the two will be drawn together. For the sake of your prettiest feature, you had better believe that to be the case. This is indeed a momentous day for the five kingdoms. This peace treaty has been long in the making. I know you must be keen to return to your families, so we will make preparations for the signing ceremony immediately. I am pleased, friends. Very pleased. As are we all. - That's it. I've got it. - You sure? You're not going to turn Arthur into a hunchback camel or a horny eyed toad? I'll save that for another day. "A second chance? "Sunset. "I'll await your presence." At last. I'll find out. Is there a problem, Uther? No, not at all. Arthur's just running a little late, that's all. As is the Lady Vivian. My love. Always. For ever. - I knew it. - I don't believe it. Father! We've got something to tell you. Father? You once said that if you truly offended my honour, then you would happily pay the price. What say you now? How have I offended your honour? Surely not with my love alone. Love?! You don't know the first thing about love. You're taking advantage of an innocent girl. I assure you, my feelings for your daughter are as real as they are strong. Unhand her or suffer the consequences. Is this really worth risking your life for? Indeed it is. I would rather die than deny my feelings. I love your daughter... with all my heart. It's no good. I have spoken to Olaf. He will not rescind the challenge. He says his honour has been tainted. He demands recompense. You didn't have to do that. The fight is to the death. What did you think you were doing? You cannot help who you fall in love with. You do you realise your actions threaten the peace talks, and it may yet bring war to Camelot? I'm happy to fight for what I believe in. What's happened to him? Nothing more. And yet, who could wish for more? I don't understand it. Trickler's magic is strong, but not stronger than mine? Love potions are strange. You need to go to Uther. It's a fight to the death. If Uther realises that one of the kings is using magic, there will certainly be a war. The only way out of this situation is to unenchant Arthur. And unenchant him fast! - Anything interesting? - Haven't you heard? Arthur was discovered in Lady Vivian's chambers. What? King Olaf has demanded recompense. They are to fight to the death. All for the love of a woman. And Lady Vivian at that. You look more shocked than I did. It is very surprising. I don't know why he couldn't control his feelings. Indeed. I'll miss the tourney if you don't mind. There's so much to organise here. But of course. - You will wish me luck? - Will I? Haven't you heard? Oh, yes, I've heard. Though sadly not from your lips. I wish you could have been more honest with me. What's she talking about? No idea. You are pleased, my lord? Do I get to keep my fingers? I shall cast your fingers in gold. I could not have wished for more. I told you I would not fail you. If Olaf kills Arthur, then Uther will start a war. If Arthur kills Olaf, then his men will start a war. We cannot lose! King Olaf has demanded recompense and by the ancient laws of Camelot, the matter will be settled by a tourney in three stages. The weapons chosen are quarter staff, mace and sword. The fight will be by the Knight's Rules and to the death. Are we all clear? One of your ribs is broken, sire. Nothing can hurt me today. I'm invincible. Love really can conquer all, Gaius. It's true. This can't go on. The fight's not fair. Arthur's head is in the clouds. I don't know what to do. Then find someone who does. This is magic indeed. Everything I have tried has failed. From what you tell me, the spell has captured his heart. And his heart is controlling his brain. There is no magic that can break this enchantment. - There must be. - It has too great a hold... I cannot let Arthur die! Patience, young warlock. The solution lies in a force greater than you or I can understand. A force that has puzzled many minds. Please, I have very little time. - A force... - Just tell me. Why, it is the greatest force of all... love. Love? You must find the person Arthur truly loves. And then? One kiss from her will break the enchantment and he will desire Vivian no more. Are you sure you can carry on, sire? As long as I have Vivian to gaze at, I can conquer the world. Besides, the mace is my forte. You'll see. Rats again? What? No. I need your help. Arthur needs your help. I do not think that Arthur needs me. Gwen, don't worry, I know. - You know what? - Everything. Anyone can see how you feel about each other. I do not have time to explain so you have to trust me. Arthur does love you. No, he doesn't. If you can't trust me, trust your feelings. - I'm never trusting my feelings again. - He's enchanted. Yes, with Lady Vivian, I can see that. I mean literally enchanted with magic, potions, love juice. - None of his feelings are genuine. - How can you be sure? When I saw him, his feelings seemed real enough. None of his feelings for her are real. But if we do not break the spell, his death will be. Search your heart... You know who he loves. Have you come to wish me good luck? I don't think I need it any more. No, Arthur, I have not come to wish you luck. Well, honestly, that's rather rude. Let me make amends. What am I doing? You're in a fight. To the death. You're losing. - But... - There is no time to explain. Just... Live for me, Arthur. That's all I ask right now. If anything should happen to me, look after Gwen. The world may think she is just a servant, dispensable, but she's not dispensable to me. This is no way to achieve peace. I thought I better deliver it myself this time. I'm sorry... for what I put you through. You have nothing to apologise for. I, too, have caused my fair share of hurt. You must believe that my feelings for... Vivian... were not real. I've never loved another. But one day you will. One day, you will find your real princess. One day, you will be King of Camelot. And I cannot be your Queen. - You don't know that. - I am as sure of that as you are. Things may change. Well, until they do... my lord. Your boy has a very wise head on his shoulders. No doubt he gets that from you. I hope that these events will not harm our peace treaty. I believe that Vivian was as much to blame as Arthur. I'll take her away from temptation. She is far too young to encounter such things. I go in peace. I am very pleased to hear that. That is more than you deserve, boy. You will run all the way home. - That's not possible, master. - Make it possible. Why so cross? Anyone would think you didn't want peace? I do. Peace... love it. Well, you may return any time to view the treaty. You're very kind. We may return, too? You are welcome. My heart will remain, and I hope to join it soon. Not too soon. It might conflict with your one true love. - My what? - You heard me. I have proof. - Proof? - You kissed her in the tent. What happened in the tent? Speak of it again and I'll kill you. The ancient prophecies speak of an alliance of Mordred and Morgana united in evil. This crystal cannot fall into enemy hands. Is it some kind of weapon? Mordred will master the crystal
