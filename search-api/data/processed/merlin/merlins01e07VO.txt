His name... Merlin Arthur... . Arthur... subtitle: chocolate What is it? You really are a total buffoon, aren't you, Merlin? I was just asking...         Who? Me or the deer?! We're supposed to be hunting. It requires speed, stealth and an agile mind. So you are able to get by on two out of three, then? What was that? Quiet!        Help! No, no, I beg you. Mercy. Help me! Forbearnan firgenholt! Stroke of luck.        And let that be a lesson to you! What? I was covering your back. Are you all right? They didn't hurt you? No... Thanks to you. I'm Sophia. This is my father. Arthur Pendragon... at your service. My name is Aulfric, heir of Tirmawr, this is my daughter Sophia. You're a long way from home. What brings you to Camelot? Our home was sacked by raiders, we barely escaped with what few possession we could carry. These are dangerous times. What will you do? We travel west to Caerleon where we have family and I hope, a new life. You must stay here a while, break your journey. A noble family like yours is always welcome at Camelot. Make sure you put her in a decent room. The one next door is empty. The one next door's fine. Excellent, in fact. Shut up, Merlin. I didn't say anything! You didn't have to. I want to make it clear that my intentions towards Sophia are completely honourable. Put her in a room on the other side of the castle. It's warmer, more comfortable.        Of course. She is, um, very beautiful. Yes, she is. And if your intentions are honourable... Oh, they are.Most definitely. Then what's the problem staying next door? There isn't one. You've convinced me. Put her in the room next to mine. If you need anything, just let me know. thank you. Who is that?        Sophia Tirmawr. We rescued her in the woods. Well, Arthur did most of the rescuing... She can't stay here. Well, the King said that she and her father are welcome in Camelot. Is everything OK? Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you. Nonsense, my child. My favourite patient is always welcome. I'm sorry about the mess. Most of it's Merlin's. If I'd known you were coming, I'd have tidied up. It's not that... Your bench is on fire. My bench is on fire? What are you... My bench is on fire! Here. You're always getting me into trouble. What brings you to this dark corner? I had another dream. I see. I saw Arthur lying under water, drowning, and there was a woman standing over him, watching him die. And she's here. In Camelot. The mind plays tricks. It borrows from everyday life and plays out its own fantasy. I had this dream before she came to Camelot. You must be mistaken. I know what I saw. It was so real... so vivid. I saw him die, Gaius. She's going to kill him. These are just dreams, Morgana, nothing more. Are you taking the sleeping draught I made up for you? It doesn't help. Here. Try this. It will induce a deeper sleep. You've nothing to fear. Thank you, Gaius. Morgana... Don't bother Uther about this - no need to worry him. You can dispense with the unpleasantries - your payment. I want more. My friends are dead because of you. Yes. I'm sorry. Such a dreadful waste of a life. If it's any consolation, you'll see them again soon. Marouf kino toyno! I'm taking Sophia out for a ride today. You know, show her around. Where do I come in to this? I'm supposed to be on patrol with the guard and my father this morning, so I need you to cover for me. What, and lie to the King? No way. No, he'll see right through me. He'll have me in the stocks quicker than you can say "rotten tomatoes". Merlin...I need you to do this for me I am a terrible liar. I start sweating, my vision blurs, my brain stops working. Well, no change there, then. Look,I promised Sophia I'd take her out. If I don't turn up, it'll blow my chances. You like her, then?        Yeah! What's not to like? I want to spend some time with her, but I need to get my father off my back. I can't order you to lie to the King but you'll be a friend for life if you do. Go on, then. You don't want to keep her waiting. Thanks, Merlin. I won't forget it. You're sure it's her? I could never forget that face. You should speak to the King.        And tell him what? That I can see the future? If you think Arthur's life is in danger... You know how he'd react. You're his ward. He wouldn't harm you. He hates magic more than he cares for me. That's not true.        Would you care to put it to the test? But what else can you do? I'm going to have to try and stop her myself. Where's my son? I'm not sure where he is. I, um, I think there's been a mistake. But it's not his fault. I mean... Stop gibbering and tell me where he is! It's probably... No, it's definitely my fault. Where is Arthur!? He's not here.        I can see that. Arthur wasn't sure his order,so he asked me to check with guard to see if he was riding out this morning and...well...I may have forgotten. You forgot?         I'm sorry, My Lord. I'm sure he would have been here had I told him. If this was a time of war, I would have you flogged. And since it's not, we'll let it go just this once? I forgot how much fun this was(!) The river's not far. It's just down here. Arthur...wait. What is it? Tuch von phrixur ator. You there. Halt! Sorry. Sorry?! You nearly shot a crossbow in my face. Are you OK? Yes. Thanks to you. They were searching for the bandits that attacked you yesterday. Here.        Don't touch that! I'm sorry. Maybe we should go back?        It's fine. I'm sorry, I was upset. Now, don't let this spoil our day together. We were having such a nice time. Let's go down to the river. I'm taking you back to Camelot. Your father would never forgive me if I let anything happen to you. Have you been playing with your food again? The King put me in the stocks. What did you do this time?        Nothing. Honestly, it wasn't my fault. Arthur wanted to get out of going on a patrol with Uther and the guard, so I covered for him and took the blame. And Arthur was prepared to let you do this? It was his idea. What made him neglect his duties? Must have been something terribly important. Sophia        The girl from the forest? He wanted to take her out for the day. He is besotted. But they've only just met.        I know. I guess it must have been love at first sight. Yes... I suppose it must be. Can I help? Forgive me! The door was open. I thought someone may have broken in. It looks like they have. I apologise for imposing on you. It won't happen again. Make sure it doesn't. You're sure you'll be all right? Yes. Thank you for today. Good night, Arthur. Sorry! Lady Morgana, isn't it? I'm Sophia. What are you doing here? My father and I are guests of the King. You're lying. I know what you're going to do to him, and I won't let it happen. Does Arthur know you feel this way about him? Of course he does. I suspect he's already turned you down. Don't think you can make a fool out of me.        I won't have to. You're managing to do that well enough already. Stay away from him!        Or what? Jealousy is such an unattractive trait in a women. If anything happens to Arthur... I'll find you. However long it takes. You've not been gone as long as I expected. We were interrupted.        What happened? I was nearly killed. For a moment, I felt what it would be like to die a mortal death. He saved me. Someone so weak, so feeble, saved ME. I can't bear to be like this a moment longer. You won't have to. Once his heart is yours, the gates of Avalon will open once again for us and we can regain our true form. I need a little more time. You must hurry. The physician can see us for what we truly are. And he is not alone. The Lady Morgana. She fears her powers, but that will not keep her quiet for long. Tomorrow, you have to finish the enchantment, otherwise our chance to rid us of these mortal shells will be lost for ever. You seem very fond of her. You make that sound like a bad thing.      Not necessarily. I've just never seen you fall under a woman's spell so quickly. If you're jealous Morgana, it's OK to admit it. Don't flatter yourself! Come on. Wouldn't be the first time, now, would it? Arthur, I'm trying to protect you. She isn't what she seems.        Why? What makes you say that? I just have a feeling. It's difficult to describe. I had a dream... a nightmare. You really are very sweet, Morgana. Why are you laughing? You. Your feelings, bad dreams. you don't have to make these stuff up. You can tell me the truth. It's obvious you like me. Less and less by the second. All right. Whatever you say. You're intolerable. I just hope I'm wrong about her. You're dressed!        Nothing gets past you, does it, Merlin. You're supposed to be wearing these. Your father is bestowing a knighthood on one of your men this morning. I'm giving it a miss. Won't the King mind? Not if you cover for me. By the way, thanks for yesterday, I heard you ended up in the stocks. Bad luck. They were throwing potatoes. It's supposed to be rotten fruit. I'm not sure there are hard-and-fast rules, but if it's any consolation, I think it was worth it. It went well?        Great. Fantastic... She's incredible. Don't worry. I'll find a way to get you out of it. Just make sure you don't end up in the stocks this time. I won't! I think I'm starting to get the hang of this whole deception lark. Wait! Careful. Don't worry. I will be. Tuch von phrixur artur.        What are you doing? Cheek nom fogish. Jamea mortharisher. Tuch von phrixur artur. Not again Merlin, surely? You'd think the appeal of pelting the same person with fruit would wear off after a while, but, oh, no! I heard that Arthur wasn't at the knighting ceremony. Yeah, he wanted to make the most of his time left with Sophia. So you helped him?        I'm his servant. I had too. You shouldn't done that Merlin. I fear that Sophia may not be all that she seems. Why? What do you know about seers? Not much. They're supposed to be able to see the future. Like prophets. It's said to be an innate ability. Those who have it are born that way. Some aren't even aware that what they see is the future. It comes in their dreams. What's this got to do with Sophia? The night before she and Aulfric came to Camelot, Morgana had a dream. Sophia was in it.        Before she arrived in Camelot? I've been watching Morgana since she was very young. Though I've tried to persuade myself otherwise, I realised that some of the things she said she'd dreamt came to pass. I kept it secret from Uther, of course. The gift of prophecy is too close to the work of magic. You think Morgana is a seer?        No, I don't think it. I fear it. Morgana said she dreamt that Sophia killed Arthur. Couldn't that have just been a dream? Maybe the woman Morgana saw just looked like Sophia. That's what I hoped. But Aulfric caught me in Sophia's room and, in a flash of anger, his eyes changed colour. Who are they? It's not WHO they are that worries me. It's WHAT they want with Arthur. Our love is strong. You feel the same way, too. If we were ever to be parted... I'd never let that happen. You may not have the choice. There are some here who don't want us to be together. I'll never let them come between us. Because we are in love. Because we are in love. You must seek permission for us to marry... so that we can be together.        Till death do us part. Tuch von phrixur artur. Till death do us part. He's ready. Tomorrow he'll do what we need him to. Good, you have done well. I must go to the elders. I seek an audience with the Sidhe elders! Not gwithim sar! Dar labran trimshah! I come before you to plead for the chance to win passage back to Avalon and a life of immortality! Your punishment for killing another sidhe is a mortal body and a mortal life. You will never be able to return to Avalon. The crime was mine, not my daughter's. The gates of Avalon remain closed to your daughter. Unless the soul of a mortal prince be offered up to them. Thank you. An immortal life for my daughter is all that I desire, so I promise you the soul of the greatest prince of all. Arthur Pendragon! Avalon. What you saw at the lake. It's Avalon. It must be. What's...        The land of eternal youth. Mortals are only supposed to glimpse it the moment before death. I've seen it and I'm still here. Extraordinary. What did it look like? Does it matter? They're going to sacrifice Arthur and we don't even know who "they" are yet. We do now. I found writing like this on the top of Aulfric's staff. It's Ogham, an ancient script. Abas ocus bithe. Duthectad bithlane. "To hold life and death in your hands." From the writing on his staff and what you saw at the lake, I'm afraid now I'm certain. We're dealing with the Sidhe. That does not sound like a good thing. They're masters of enchantment. Do you think Arthur's been enchanted? Almost certainly. I'm afraid Morgana's dream is coming true. Our request this audience, Father, to discuss a matter of great importance. It cannot have escaped your attention that I and Lady Sophia Tirmawr have grown very close.        Not too close, I hope. We're in love. Which is why I come before you today I assume you're joking. No. I'm going to marry her. But you only met two days ago. We're in love. In love? We had no idea that you were such a romantic, had we, Morgana? No, he's full of surprises. I'm going to marry her. I don't care what either of you think about it. I thought you'd come to ask my permission. Out of courtesy, nothing more. Guards, door. You've forgotten whose court you're standing in. You won't stop me. If I want to marry her, I will. Arrest Sophia and Aulfric Tirmawr. What are you doing? And inform the executioner his services will be required tomorrow morning. You can't do this. Yes, I can, and you show me some respect, I will! Release them. You've got your whole life ahead of you. Sophia is no doubt your first love but she certainly won't be the only one. Enjoy yourself while you can. You're not planning on springing any surprises on me, are you? You should be taking this more seriously. He's young, foolish and in love. Give it a week and he'll be chasing after the next girl. Sophia won't let that happen. Do you bear a grudge against her? There's something about her I don't trust. You've seen the way Arthur's changed. He's a fool in love.        She's dangerous. Dangerous? To who? Arthur.        Why do you say that? I just have a sense, a feeling. And what has she done to make you have this feeling? Nothing, yet, it's what she's going to do. I don't know how to tell you this.        Try. Whatever it is, you can tell me. I've just seen girls like this before. They string men along and then drop them. I don't want to see him get hurt. I know you want to protect him but some lessons we have to learn for ourselves. He'll hurt for a week and then Sophia will be forgotten. I hope so. Are you sure there's nothing else behind this? Yes, it's nothing. Get out. I thought the King was a bit harsh. I don't need sympathy, Merlin, especially not from you. But I did think he had a point. I ordered you to get out. Now leave me! I know you think you're in love with Sophia... Who are you to tell me what I'm thinking? I'm your friend. No, Merlin, you're my servant. You don't know what you're doing. She's cast a spell on you. You're enchanted. I told you people would try to keep us apart. I know. I won't let that happen. Don't listen to her, she's controlling you. We can elope together. Get away from this place. These people. I saw you. I followed him. They're planning to sacrifice you. You let your servant talk to your guests this way. I know what you're going to do. I followed you to the lake and heard everything You must believe me. Don't listen to him, Arthur. Let's go. Let's leave tonight. She's going to kill you. Sophia plans to sacrifice you to buy a life of immortality. If you go with her, you'll die. It doesn't make sense. We're in love. They're magical beings. Look at the writing on the staff. Look at his eyes. Look at him. Do you believe me now? Arthur, do you see?        I see everything. He's gone, Arthur's gone with her. She's taken him. Slow down. I know you don't believe me but I'm so sure it's going to happen. My dream will come true.        I do believe you. I've got to tell Uther. You can't.        I've got to do something, if I don't then Arthur'll die. You can't tell Uther about your dream. If Uther thinks you've got the seers' power, he'll charge you with witchcraft. I don't have a choice. I couldn't live with myself if I'd let him die. Wait. We've known each other a long time, you trust me don't you? Yes, you know I do. Then trust me now. Stay here and don't say a word to anyone about this. But Arthur...        I'll take care of it. Where are you going?        To find someone who can help. Merlin! What happened to you? Aulfric. Where's Arthur? I have got to go after him. What's that buzzing noise? Careful, Merlin, you can barely stand up.        I have to go. You can't, not in this state. You owe it to your powers that you survived this at all. I'll be fine, he needs me. Has that buzzing stopped? Yes.        Liar. I have to go, Gaius. He'll die if I don't. The Sidhe are a vicious people. You must be careful. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. Merlin? This way.        Just testing. Go. They're waiting for you. I don't understand. You're coming too. Only one of us can pass through. This was never meant for me. I only wanted this so we could both return to Avalon. Your destiny is on a different path to mine. It is my fate to live a mortal life. I don't want to leave you.        You must. Once the ceremony begins you must go through with it. The elders expect a soul. If they don't get his they will take yours. Goodbye. I will never forget you. Father! No! No! Og kelis! Arthur! Arthur! Arthur? Arthur? What happened? Where am I? Can you remember anything? Ow! Oh, my head! There was a girl. Sophia, she... I asked my father something about her, I asked him... What was I thinking? Well, we did wonder. Especially when you eloped with her last night. I did what?        Merlin had to bring you back to Camelot. I don't recall any of this. It must've been some blow. What blow? Well, when I caught up with you I couldn't persuade you to return you were beyond reason. So I had to make you. You managed to knock me out? Yep. With a lump of wood. He only did it to bring you back safely. No-one can know about this. Any of it. Is that understood? When you failed to show up for patrol this morning, I feared you'd eloped with Sophia in a fit of passion. I wish he had. Because then I wouldn't be standing in front of you feeling like an idiot...again. This is becoming a near daily occurrence for you. There was a mistake. And I would not say it was anyone's fault. Not really. You could say it was mine. Could somebody tell me what happened? Well... Someone with a brain. After Sophia left, I wanted to take my mind off her so I went for a hunt. And killing things mends a broken heart? No, but it's good fun. Merlin was meant to inform you that I wouldn't be back until later today. Have you some kind of mental affliction? Probably.        I'm looking into it, sire. Well, I hope for our sake you find a cure. Or we'll find ourselves with a food shortage on our hands. Food shortage? Morgana. I've had some troubled nights. I prepared another draught for you. Have the dreams stopped? Arthur told me what actually happened. You must have hit him round the head really hard. Yeah. I feel really bad about that. Here you are. Remember, every night just before you go to sleep. Thank you, Gaius. She must never find out the truth. Why not? She had a premonition that helped save Arthur's life. It could've cost her her own. If Uther ever found out, things would never be the same again. It must remain a secret. Is she like me? Can she use magic? No-one's like you, Merlin. But she has the gift? For her sake, I hope not. You should not protect this boy. He's a druid. His kind would see me dead and you would help them. If the boy lives you cannot fulfil your destiny. Enough! We need your help. So now you want me to risk my neck too.
