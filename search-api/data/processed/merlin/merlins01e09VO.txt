'His name...Merlin.' Yehairamay wan knicht awak. Beyar stranger an steacra for brektha wanei. Upares arek Uther Pendragon! Do you solemnly swear to govern the people of this kingdom and its dominions according to the statutes, customs and laws laid down by your forebears? I do, Sire. Do you promise to exercise mercy and justice in your deeds and judgments? I do, Sire. And do you swear allegiance to Camelot now, and for as long as you shall live? I, Arthur Pendragon, do pledge life and limb to your service and to the protection of this kingdom and its peoples. Now being of age and heir apparent, from henceforth, you shall be Crown Prince of Camelot. So how does it feel to be servant to the Crown Prince of Camelot Washing his royal socks will be even more of a privilege. You're proud of him, really!Even if you??? I am not. You are. I can see it in your face. Those socks are clean! Of course I'm proud of them. What in the devil's name? I, Sir Owain, accept your challenge. Single combat. Noon tomorrow. To the death. Have you ever seen this Black Knight before? I don't believe so. You didn't recognise his crest?        Crest? Which house is it?        I'm not sure. I didn't see it clearly. But he's not someone you'd forget in a hurry.isn't it no So you don't think he's from around here? That would seem likely.        Then what's he doing here? Your faith in my all-seeing-knowledge is both touching and wholly misplaced.Maybe if you've finished your work, you could go to bed and leave me to finish mine. OK, I'm going. Gaius? Merlin. Do you think Owain can beat him? We will find out soon enough. He shouldn't have picked it up!        So put an end to it. The challenge has been taken up. It cannot be stopped. Then fight in his place.        I can't! Why not?        Owain picked up the gauntlet. Owain is the one who must fight. That is the Knight's Code. He knew that. But it's a fight to the death. I know. Gaius. Thank God. You know why I'm here?        The Black Knight. So it is he? You saw his crest?        Have you confirmed it? It is the crest of Tristan de Bois. And he's the only knight ever to have carried such a crest? Yes. According to the records. Yes? I'm sorry to disturb you, Sire. What is it? The knight, the stranger. He bears the crest of Tristan de Bois. Yes. But he's been dead for 20 years. I know. I killed him. Then how do you explain...?        Dead men do not return. You've never fought in mortal combat before. It's different. It's not like the training.        Yeah, I know. Listen to me. The problem is, we've never seen him fight. You have to get the measure of him. But I have the same advantage. He's never seen me fight. True. You've watched me.        Yes. And        I know no-one braver. Remember, all it takes to kill a man is one well-aimed blow. The Lady Morgana asked me to give you this token. She wishes you to wear it for luck. You can thank her, and tell her I shall wear it with pride, but I won't need luck. Now remember, find the flow of the fight and try to control it. The fight shall be to the knight's rules. To the death. Let battle commence. Come on, Owain! One well-aimed blow! Yes! Who will take up my challenge? I, Sir Pellinor, take up the challenge. So be it. Should we tend to his wounds? He took a hit. Owain didn't land a blow. The sword definitely pierced him.        Are you sure? My eyes are quicker than yours. He should be dead. Perhaps he already is. Why did you stop me? I have to give our knights to prove themselves. Have you seen how this stranger fights?! And Sir Pellinor is more than a match for him. He's not recovered from the wounds he suffered at Othanden. I can't help that.        So you send him to his death? It was his choice to take up the gauntlet. I am not to blame. Are you sure we should be doing this? You're not scared, are you? No, I love old crypts. I wouldn't be seen dead anywhere else. Must've been a gust of wind. We should've brought a torch. Leoc morla. Huh? Handy! Yes. What are we looking for? Bring your torch over here. We're breaking into someone's grave? We're too late. I think someone has already broken out. Tristan de Bois was the brother of Ygraine. Uther's wife. Arthur's mother? Ygraine died in childbirth. He blamed Uther and came to the gates of Camelot and challenged him. To single combat? Uther won. But in his dying breath, Tristan cursed Camelot to one day suffer his return. I thought it was the ramblings of a dying man. Men don't just rise up from the dead though, no matter how angry they are. It's my guess we're dealing with a wraith. A wraith? The spirit of a dead man conjured from the grave. So this is the work of a sorcerer? Powerful magic can harness a grieving, rage and demented soul and make it live again. How do we stop it? We can't. Because it's not alive, no mortal weapon can kill it. There must be something. Nothing can stop it until it has achieved what it came for. What's that? Revenge. On Camelot? What does that mean for Sir Pellinor? I'm afraid it doesn't look good. Maybe you were wrong. I hope so. The sword went in, I'm sure.        I saw too. I, Arthur Pendragon, challenge you. So be it. Single combat. Noon tomorrow. How could you be so stupid? I will revoke the challenge. The Knight's Code must be upheld. That's what you told me. This is different. Once the challenge is laid down... You are Crown Prince. There cannot be one rule for me and one for all the rest. I forbid you to fight. You want me to prove I'm worthy of the throne. I cannot do that by being a coward. No, Arthur, this will be your death! I'm sorry you have so little faith in me, Father. Arthur! You were right. I wish I wasn't. Arthur will die. He is Camelot's strongest warrior. If anyone can defeat it, he can. You said yourself, no mortal weapon can kill it. We have to find a way to defeat the wraith ourselves. How do you propose to do that? If no mortal sword will kill it... ..then I will. With mortal magic. It's too dangerous.        We don't have a choice. Good evening, Sire.        Gaius. There is a matter of great urgency which I must discuss with you Then spit it out. Tristan's tomb is empty. I believe he has been conjured from the dead. How is this possible? I believe he's a wraith. A spirit? He's come to take Revenge for Ygraine's death It was magic that killed her, not I. Nevertheless, it was you he blamed. You cannot allow Arthur to fight. No weapon forged by man can kill a wraith. It will stop at nothing until it has accomplished what it came for. Arthur cannot win, he will die. He will not listen to me. Then you must tell him who the knight is. No. You cannot hide the truth forever. I am the King! You will not tell me what I can and cannot do! That is your choice, Sire. You tell him, or let him go to his death. No-one but you or I will ever know the secret of Arthur's birth. The boy is of age, he should know. Never! You made an oath. I warn you not to break it. Very well, Sire. Leave me. Cume hay forbearnar. Merlin, you know that conversation we had about knocking... You have to pull out.        And why's that? Because he'll kill you. Why does everybody think that?        Because they're right. Just pull out. You're the crown prince. No-one wants to see you die over some stupid challenge. I am not a coward.        I know that. I've watched you overcome every fear you've ever faced. That's what's required. You are more than that,you're not nearly a mere warrior. You're a prince, a future king. You've proved your courage, but you must prove your wisdom.        I'm not backing down. Arthur, listen to me. This is no ordinary knight. Look at him. He doesn't eat, he doesn't sleep. He just stands there in complete silence. Doesn't that tell you something? No-one is unbeatable. If you fight him, you will die. I'm not listening to this. I'm trying to warn you, Arthur. And I'm trying to warn you, Merlin! I should've known. It is more than I had hoped for, Uther. Soon Arthur will be slain. You will have sent him to his death. Haven't you tired of revenge?        Haven't you? You began this war when you threw me from the court and slaughter all of my kind You brought it on yourselves. You practised evil. I was your friend, Uther! You welcomed me here. You betrayed that friendship.        I did as you asked! I used the magic you so despise to give your barren wife the son you craved. Don't ever speak of her in that way! She was my heart, my soul. And you took her from me. She died giving birth to your son. It was not my choice. That is the law of magic. To create a life, there was a death. The balance of the world had to be repaid. You knew it would kill her!        No, you're wrong. If I had foreseen her death, and the terrible retribution you would seek... ..I would never have granted your wish. I wish you hadn't. You wish you didn't have a son? Well, your wish will come true tomorrow. I will not let you take him. I have watched so many people I love die at your hands, Uther Pendragon Now it is your turn. How did you get in here? The door was open.        No, I locked it. Someone else must've opened it. And you thought you'd come in and help yourself? I was looking for a book. For Gaius. He thinks the Black Knight is a wraith. Then Arthur is in grave peril. Which is why I'm here. I need to find a weapon that will kill something that's already dead. I have read of such things in the ancient chronicles. Really? What did they say? Several fables speak of ancient swords... That can kill the dead? The swords the fables speak could destroy anything, alive or dead. Can you show me one of these fables? Well, let me think. Yes. i'm sort if hurry Yes, you young people always are. This is the Chronicle of Beltain. Now then... Ah, here we are. Sir Marhaus looked upon the great sword, begotten in the dragon's breath and found it passing good. What did you say?        Sir Marhaus... No, no, no. Not about him. The dragon. The great sword begotten in the dragon's breath and found it passing good. Merlin. What're you doing here? I come to ask a favor        Yes? I'm not sure how to ask it. Ask, Merlin. You know I'd grant you anything. I mean, not anything. Obviously, not anything. What is it you want? I...I've come to ask for a sword. The strongest your father's ever made. What for? To save Arthur. I don't want you to fight tomorrow. You're worried about me? I don't know what it is. Please, I'm begging you. I have to do this. It's my duty. I understand. I'm sorry. You knew that this business would come back to haunt me. Not quite so literally. I should've listened to you. You said that no good would come of using witchcraft at Arthur's birth. You wanted an heir. You thought it was the only way. Nimueh told me there would be a price. You weren't to know that that price would be Ygraine's life. I cannot let Arthur die. Then you must stop the fight. No, I will take his place. Do you know what you're saying? Ygraine gave up her life for him. So must I.        Uther... I have no other choice. There must be another way. My death will stop the wraith and Arthur will live. and it means you're the only person left who knows the truth about Arthur's birth. I want you to swear to me that you will keep your oath. i'll take it to my grave You've always been a good friend,despite my temper. I always thought that would be the death of you. I have one other favour to ask. My father's been saving this. He's always said it was the best sword he's ever made. It's perfect. He'll kill me if he finds I've taken it. He'll understand. You did it for Arthur. I knew you were proud of him really. Merlin! Do you know why I'm here? It may surprise you, Merlin, but my knowledge of your life is not universal. It's to do with Arthur. His life's in danger. He will die, unless I can make a weapon that will kill the dead. So what do you come to ask of me? Will you burnish it, to save Arthur? The dead do not return without reason. Who has he come for?        Uther. Then let him take his vengeance and the wraith will die without my aid. But it's Arthur who's going to fight him. You have to save him. That is your destiny, young warlock, not mine. But if Arthur fights the wraith and dies, Camelot will have no heir. I will have no destiny. A weapon forged with my assistance will have great power. I know. You do not know. You can only guess. You have not seen what I have seen. If you had, perhaps you would not ask this of me. What do you mean? In the wrong hands, this sword could do great evil. It must be wielded by Arthur and him alone. I understand. You must do more than understand. You must promise. I promise. Heed my words. The sword was forged for Arthur, and him alone. I've brought you something to help you sleep. I'm fine. I don't need it. Here. It'll relax you, take the edge off your nerves. I wouldn't drink it for pleasure. Why don't you sit down for a moment? Mind you, if you... forget about the taste, the after effect is... quite pleasurable. Just lie back. That's a fine blade. It's for Arthur.        He won't be needing it today. I will be taking Arthur's place. But Sire... Prepare me for battle. Arthur should fight. The grievance was with me, the fight is mine. I don't have your armour.        That will do. It's likely to make little difference. I'll get you your sword.        This one will be fine. No, Sire. You don't understand. That one was made specifically for Arthur. Who made it? Um, er, Tom, the blacksmith. It's worthy of a King. You would be better off with a sword you trusted. No. It has almost perfect balance. Tom is not the Royal Swordsmith. I'm surprised Arthur went to him. That was me. I felt he needed a better sword. You show him the most extraordinary loyalty. That is my job, Sire. But beyond the line of duty. Well... You could say... ..there is a bond between us. I'm glad. Look after him. You can have what you came for. The father, not the son. I thought you said a wraith couldn't be killed. Yes, it was remarkable. Is that a new sword, Sire? It's the best I've ever fought with. May I have a look? I was intrigued by those markings. On one side it says, "Take me up," and on the other, "Cast me away." What does that mean? May I ask who made it, Sire? Merlin gave it me. It was forged for Arthur. That should heal pretty quickly. I'll re-dress it tomorrow. Thank you, Gaius. Thank you for everything. You had Gaius drug me. I was meant to fight him!        No, you weren't. But the Knight's Code...        Be damned! I believed you would die. And that was a risk I could not take.You are too precious to me You mean more to me than anything I know, more than this entire kingdom, and certainly more than my own life. I've always thought that...        What? That...I was a big disappointment to you. Well, that is my fault, and not yours. You are my only son. And I wouldn't wish for another. I heard you fought pretty well.        Thanks. You should join us for training. Sort out your footwork. I'll show you footwork. You know why I'm looking at you.        No. Uther told me you provided him with his sword today. It must have been a very powerful blade to slay the dead. Did you enchant it?        No...I didn't. Who did then? Wasn't me. Shame. It saved the King's life, I'd have been very proud of you. Well...        Never mind. 'Merlin! 'Merlin... 'Merlin!' So, does Arthur live? Yes, the sword worked. It was incredible, amazing. As I promised.        But... Yes? Things didn't quite go according to plan. I mean they did, except... it wasn't Arthur who wielded the sword. It was Uther. I tried, but he just took it. Uther's the King. I couldn't stop him! The sword was born of the old magic. You have no idea of its power. In the hands of Uther, it will bring only evil. I'll get it back. You have betrayed me. You are not ready to be trusted. I'll bring it to you. You can destroy it. What is made cannot be unmade. So what do you want me to do? Take the sword far from here and place it where no mortal man can ever find it. I'm going back to Ealdor. If you used your magic, no-one else would die. There's too many! If it comes to a choice between saving people's lives and revealing who I really am, there is no choice.
