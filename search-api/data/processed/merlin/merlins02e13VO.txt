rests on the shoulders of a young boy.</i> His name... Merlin. I know you're tired, but make one last effort for me. Every shot must count. - They can't suffer a 3rd night of this. - We must trust in Arthur. I do. But even he has little chance. I'm sorry you're having to do this. Why? You're not to blame. Flame up! Stay strong, for tonight is not your night to die, I will make sure of that. Hold firm! Hold... Now! Arthur's Knights Merlin - 2x13 The Last Dragonlord We've no clean water. I know, but it's too dangerous to go out there. Gwen, don't! Clear the square! Do not imagine that your petty magic can harm me! Why are you doing this? You're killing innocent people! You shouldn't have risked your life. I wasn't going to let anything happen to you. - Are you hurt? - There's nothing I can do. My magic is no good. - It doesn't work. - Dragons aren't monsters. They're creatures of wonder and magic. You must realise that they are immune to your powers. The dead number 49 men, 27 women, a further 18 women and children are unaccounted for. Most of last night's fires are now out. The castle walls, in particular the Western section, are near to collapse. I could go on. Do we have any further idea on how the beast escaped? I regret to say, Sire, we don't. There must be some way to rid ourselves of this... aberration. We need a Dragonlord. You know well that's not an option. Sire, what if... there was indeed one last Dragonlord left? - That's not possible. - But if there was? - What are you saying? - It may be just rumour... Go on. I'm not exactly sure, but... I think his name is Balinor. - Balinor? - Where does he live? He was last seen in Cenred's kingdom, in the border town of Engerd, but that was many years ago. If this man still exists, then it is our duty to find him. Our treaty with Cenred no longer holds, we are at war. If they discover you beyond our border, they will kill you. I will go alone. I'll not be detected. - No, it is too dangerous. - More dangerous than staying here? I will not stand by and watch my men die when I had the chance to save them. They're my orders. Do not make this a test of wills. I am not talking to you as a father, but as a King! I will ride immediately. - My concern is for you. - Mine is for Camelot. I will send word when I have found him. Prepare the horses. Who were the Dragonlords? There were men who could talk to the dragons, tame them. What happened to them? Uther believed the art of the Dragonlord was too close to magic, so he had them all rounded up... and slaughtered. But one survived. - How did you know? - I helped him escape. You've never heard the name Balinor? Your mother never mentioned him? My mother? She took him in. - She stood up against Uther? - Yes. - She was brave. - Yes. When Uther discovered where Balinor was, he sent knights to Ealdor to hunt him down. - He was forced to flee. - Why didn't my mother tell me this? I promised her I would never speak of these things. Of what? I've always treated you as my son. But that is not what you are. The man you are going to look for... is your father. My father...? He was a Dragonlord? Why did no-one ever tell me? I wanted to. Your mother feared it'd be too dangerous. I had a right to know. She wanted to protect you. I had a right to know. Have you got everything you need? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... I know that. Come on, Merlin. - You're ready? - No thanks to you. - Are you okay? - It's just a scratch. Whatever happens, do not let Arthur know who this man is. Uther would view the son of a Dragonlord with the deepest suspicion. This is it. One more step and we're in Cenred's kingdom. This Balinor better be worth it. Greetings! We're looking for a man named Balinor. I'm willing to pay... handsomely. Never heard of him. - You think one of these men is Balinor? - I hope not. So do I. - What is wrong with you today? - What? It pains me to admit it, but I do enjoy your surly retorts. In fact, it is probably your only redeemable feature. Thanks. There are loads of servants who can serve, but so few are capable of making a complete prat of themselves. - What? - Nothing. It's something. Tell me. All right, I know I'm a prince... so we can't be friends. - But if I wasn't a prince... - What? Well, then... I think we'd probably get on. So? So that means you can tell me. That's true. If you weren't a prince, I'd tell you to mind your own business. Are you missing Gaius? Something like that. What is it? I'll tell you. I'm worried about everyone in Camelot. I hope they're all right. So do I. Hold... Now! What's... - Do you know the punishment for theft? - I've got children to feed... Tell me where to find Balinor. - I don't know. - What do you know of him? Nothing, I... Do you value your life? - It's been many years since I saw him. - But you know where he lives? You must travel through the forest of Merendra, to the foot of Feorre mountain. There, you will find the cave where Balinor dwells. - But don't get your hopes up. - Why? He will not welcome you. Balinor's hates everyone and everything. A cave's the best place for him. It's all right. No, it's the wound. Let me have look. - What d'you want here, boy? - My friend, he's sick. He needs help. Show me, boy. What are you waiting for? Fetch him! He needs rest. Will he be all right? By morning. Thank you. Looks good. - How long have you lived here? - A few winters. - Must be hard. - Why are you here? Just travelling. We're looking for someone. I was told... Well, they said that he lived somewhere hereabouts. A man named... Balinor. You've never heard of him? - He was a dragonlord. - He's passed on. - You knew him? - Who are you? I'm... Merlin. And him? - He's my master. - His name? His name is... Lancelot. He's a Knight, you know, but a nice one. His name... is Arthur Pendragon. He is Uther's son. - Yes. - This is Cenred's kingdom. He's asking for trouble. What do you want from me? Are you Balinor? The Great Dragon is attacking Camelot. His name is Kilgharrah. We can't stop him. Only you, a Dragonlord, can. He does not act blindly. He kills for a reason, vengeance. This is of Uther's making. He's killing innocent people. Uther pursued me. He hunted me like an animal. I know. What d'you know about anybody's life, boy? Uther asked me to use my power to bring the last dragon to Camelot. He said he wanted to make peace with it, but he did not. He lied to me. He betrayed me. - And you want me to protect this man? - I want you to protect Camelot. He killed every one of my kind, I alone escaped. Where did you go? There is a place called Ealdor. I had a life there. A woman... A good woman. Ealdor is beyond Uther's realm, but still he pursued me. Why would he not let me be? What was it that I had done, that he wanted to destroy the life I'd built, abandon the woman I loved? He sent Knights to kill me. I was forced to come here... to this. I understand how Kilgharrah feels. He's lost every one of his kind, every one of his kin. You want to know how that feels? Look around, boy. Let Uther die. Let Camelot fall. - You want everyone in Camelot to die? - Why should I care? - What if one of them was your son? - I don't have a son. And if I told you... I feel great! What the hell did you give me? It was all down to Balinor. So we've found him, then. Thank heaven for that. - It doesn't mean he's willing to help. - What? You won't persuade him. Does he know what's at stake? What kind of a man is he? I don't know. I thought he'd be something more. Are you missing Morgana? She's stronger than people think. I believe that, wherever she is, she'll be all right. And Arthur? You care a lot for him, don't you? Everyone does. I think he cares the same way about you. It's all right, I won't tell anyone. I know it can never be. Well, the world is a strange place, Guinevere. Never underestimate the power of love. I've seen it change many things. What did he say? He will change his mind. - He said that? - Just... give him a moment. Farewell. It's your decision? I will not help Uther. Then the people of Camelot are damned! So be it. Have you no conscience? You should ask that question... of your father. And you are no better than him. Don't waste your time, Merlin. Gaius spoke of the nobility of Dragonlords. He was wrong. A good man. I was hoping you'd be like him. I wanted... Well, there's no point. I always thought that silence would be a blessing with you, but I find it just as irritating. You're a riddle. - A riddle? - Yes. But I've got to quite like you. Now I realise you're not as big a fool as you look. I feel the same. Now that I realize you're not as arrogant as you sound. You still think I'm arrogant? More... supercilious. That's a big word, Merlin. You sure you know what it means? - Condescending. - Very good. - Patronising. - Not exactly. - No, you're these as well. - Hang on. Overbearing. Very overbearing. But you wanted me to talk. Careful, boy. I thought you might need some help. This is dangerous country. Will you return to Camelot with us? You were right, Merlin. There are some in Camelot who risked their lives for me. I owe a debt that must be repaid. If you succeed in killing the dragon, you will not go unrewarded. I seek no reward. Great. Let's eat. - This wood is too wet. - Don't worry. We'll find a way to make it light. When you healed Arthur, I heard you mumble some words. An ancient prayer. I thought it might have been more than that. The Old Religion can teach us many things. The Old Religion is that something you were taught? It is not something you can learn. Either it's a part of you or it isn't. My father knew that and his father before him. Were they also Dragonlords? We'll need some kindling. You mentioned... You spoke of Ealdor. You took refuge with a woman. - That was a long time ago. - I grew up there. I know the woman. Hunith? She is alive? She's my mother. Then she married. That's good. She never married. I'm your son. I don't know what it is to have a son. Or I a father. You must not tell Arthur. Why did you never return? I thought her life would be better without me. Why? Uther wanted me dead. If he'd found me, he'd have killed me and your mother. I wanted her to be safe. We could've come with you. And what kind of life would you have had here? We'd have been... happy. When we have finished in Camelot... I will to take you to Ealdor. She won't recognise me. I see her in you. You have her kindness. How did you become a Dragonlord? You don't choose to become a Dragonlord, it's not something you're taught. It's a sacred gift. For thousands of years, it's been handed down from father to son. And that is what you must now become. I'd like that. Like all Dragonlords, you won't know for sure that you have that power until you face your first dragon. You should sleep. We've a big day ahead of us. Good night, son. Sleep well, Father. Cenred's men! I see you have your father's talent. Please! No. Please. - I can save you. - Listen to me. When you face the Dragon... remember be strong. A dragon's heart is on its right side, - not its left. - I can't do it alone. Listen to me. You are my son. I've seen enough in you to know you will make me proud. Camelot is doomed. I'm sorry, I have failed you. The last Dragonlord is dead. There were many years when I might've wished for that news. All is not lost. We have to fight the monster ourselves, so let us ride out and fight on our own terms... on open ground, on horseback, where we can manoeuvre better. - There is no point. - So what? We stand here... watch Camelot fall? You have my blessing. I need a dozen Knights. Those who do not wish to fight can do so without stain on their character, for those brave enough to volunteer should know... the chances of returning are slim. What happened? I couldn't save him. He said the Dragonlord's gift is passed from father to son. That is true. When I faced the Great Dragon... my magic was useless. Your father wasn't dead. It's only then you can inherit his powers. You think I am strong enough to stand up to him? Only time will tell. Look on the bright side. Chances are you're not going to have to clean this again. You must be careful today. - Do not force the battle. - Yes, Sire. - I'm serious. - I can hear that. - Let matters take their course... - If I die... please... What? The Dragonlord today. I saw you. One thing I tell all my young Knights... no man is worth your tears. You're certainly not. - What are you doing? - I'm coming with you. The chances are I'm going to die. Yeah, you probably would if I wasn't there. Right! Do you know how many times I had to save your Royal backside? Well, at least you've got your sense of humour back. Are you going to face this dragon? I'm not going to sit here and watch. I know it's hard for you to understand how I feel, but... I care a lot about that armour. I'm not going to let you mess it up. Hold firm. Hold! Now! Stop... Stop! You are the last Dragonlord now. You alone carry the ancient gift. Deep within yourself, you must find the voice that you and Kilgharrah share,</i> for your soul and his are brothers. When you speak to him as kin, he must obey your will. I am the last of my kind, Merlin. Whatever wrongs I have done, do not make me responsible for the death of my noble breed. Go! Leave! If you ever attack Camelot again, I will kill you. I have shown you mercy. Now you must do the same to others. Young warlock, what you have shown is what you will be. I will not forget your clemency. I'm sure our paths will cross again. What happened? You dealt him a mortal blow. He's gone? You did it. You did it. I thought I'd lost you. My boy! I felt him there with me. He'll always be with you. I hope so. Merlin, I know I can never compare with your father, but for what it's worth... you've still got me.
