on the shoulders of a young boy. Merlin! Spear. Do you have any natural gifts, Merlin? No. Let me think... I'm not naturally rude or insensitive. Just naturally irritating. It's probably more scared of you than you are of it. Have we lost it? Who's missing? Where's Sir Bedivere? Aaaaagh! The creature you describe has all the characteristics of the Questing Beast. Surely that's a myth. The appearance of the Questing Beast is supposed to foreshadow a time of great upheaval. Gaius, that's an old wives' tale. Look, whatever it is, it is spreading panic. The people fear it will enter the city. Then we must kill it. Arthur, gather the guard together. We ride at dawn. I beg you, Sire - do not dismiss this. The beast is an omen. I have seen it come before - the night your wife Ygraine passed away. I've told you not to speak of that night again. I have conquered the Old Religion. Its warnings mean nothing to me now. Arthur will destroy the beast and we no longer suffer at its hand. This is no ordinary beast, Merlin. Don't worry. No, listen to me. You don't understand. Uther may not respect the Old Religion, but it is very real. To face a beast such as this, you must understand where it came from. What do you mean? At the very heart of the Old Religion lies the magic of life and death itself. The Questing Beast carries that power. One bite, you die. And there is no cure. Morgana! Morgana! Wake up! No! No! It's me, it's Gwen! Stop it. It was just another dream. It was terrifying. It's all right. You've seen the foe we face. It's a creature of nightmare. But you are the best knights in the realm. We can and will kill it, before it harms another citizen of our kingdom. For the love of Camelot! For the love of Camelot! Arthur! Morgana, what are you doing? You cannot face it! Morgana, go back to bed. There is nothing to be afraid of. Please, Arthur. I have seen terrible things. You cannot go. She's probably had a bad dream, Sire. I'll take her to see Gaius. No, I will not let you go! Please, Merlin, get her inside. No! I will make sure he is safe, my lady. I promise. No! No! Let's follow the trail. Keep close. What is it? Shh! Hey! Aaagh! Fleoge. Bregdan anwiele gefeluec! It didn't bite you, did it? Arthur! Somebody help me! What's happened? He's been bitten! I tried to save him. We must tell the King. There must be something you can do. I wish there was. I'll find a cure. Merlin! Trust me. Can you hear me, Sire? Here. The King will be here any moment. He can't die. It is my destiny to protect him. We haven't done all the things we're meant to do! That is the lament of all men. Gaius, he's my friend. Then save him. Gethlio! Thurhaele! Maybe the spells need time to take effect. The bite of the Questing Beast is a death sentence that no magic can overturn. Where is my son? Arthur! Do something, Gaius! I am trying, Your Majesty. Gaius will find a cure. He will not let him die. I will do everything in my power. I will bear him to his chamber. I have failed Arthur, failed in my destiny. And yet, you would not be here if that were true. He was bitten by the Questing Beast. He's going to die. Does he still breathe? Only just. Then there is still time to heal him. I've tried, I cannot save him. You do not know how to save him. But you can tell me how? Perhaps. It will not be easy. I will do anything. Anything? Please. Just tell me what I have to do! Very well. The Questing Beast is a creature conjured by the powers of the Old Religion. You must use the same ancient magic to save him. The Old Religion died out centuries ago. The Old Religion is the magic of the earth itself. It is the essence which binds all things together. It will last long beyond the time of men. But how can that help me save Arthur? You must find those who still serve it. Those who hold dominion over life and death. Go to the place that men call the Isle of the Blessed, where the power of the ancients can still be felt. There you will discover Arthur's salvation. Thank you. Thank you. And Merlin - the young Pendragon must live, no matter what the cost. Merlin, you're back. I need your help. We must get this to Arthur to ease his passing. No. We have to save him. We've already tried. The Beast comes from the Old Religion - the cure must come from there as well. There are few left with such an art. There is an island beyond the white mountains... No! The Isle of the Blessed - you know it? It was said to be the centre of the Old Religion, the focus of its power. Why did you keep this from me? Because it was too dangerous, Merlin. It's our only chance! I have to find it. And once you are there, what will you ask? For Arthur to be saved. The Questing Beast chose Arthur. That means the Old Religion has decided his fate. Then I will convince them to change their minds. It is not that simple! The high priests have the power to mirror life and death. But there will be a price to pay. Merlin, please, I beg of you... I'm sorry, Gaius. But whatever the price is, I will pay it gladly. Here. You'll need a map. And I'm going to give you this. My mother gave it to me. It's a rabbit's foot. To keep you safe? It was said to protect you from evil spirits. It's rubbish. I don't believe the superstition. I don't know why I gave it to you. No. I want it. Thank you. You've got to keep Arthur alive until I get back. HE MOANS IN PAIN Sleep, Arthur. 'You must travel to the place that men call the Isle of the Blessed, 'beyond the white mountains, through the Valley of the Fallen Kings. 'To the north of the Great Seas of Meredor, you will find a lake.' Gaius. You should get some rest. He must not be left alone. I will nurse him. You're not going to die, Arthur. I'm telling you. Because I know that one day, you will be King, a greater king than your father could ever be. It's what keeps me going. You are going to live to be the man I've seen inside you, Arthur. I can see a Camelot that is fair and just. I can see a king that the people will love and be proud to call their sovereign. For the love of Camelot... you have to live. Is there anything I can get Your Majesty? The people have begun to say goodbye. He is not yet gone, Sire. But he will not recover. Not without a miracle. I don't believe in miracles. Astyre! Hello? Hello, Merlin. You? Do you know who I am? Nimueh. You can't be who the Dragon meant. And why is that? You tried to kill me. Before I understood your importance. And Arthur... Arthur was never destined to die at my hand. And now, it seems I will be his salvation. So you know what I've come to ask? Yes. Will you do it? I do not have the power to mirror life itself and yet give nothing in return. I know a price will be asked. To save a life, there must be a death. The balance of the world must be restored. I willingly give my life for Arthur's. How brave you are, Merlin. If only it were that simple. What do you mean? Once you enter into this bargain, it cannot be undone. Whatever I have to do, I will do. His life is worth a hundred of mine. The Cup of Life, blessed by centuries of powerful sorcery so that it contains the very secret of life itself. If Arthur drinks water from the cup...he will live. Tidrenas! The bargain is struck. I hope it pleases you. Merlin! We need to give this to Arthur. What is it? Water, drawn from the Cup of Life. If Arthur drinks from it, he will recover. Please hurry! What are you waiting for? What price did you pay to redeem his life? Whose life did you bargain? We don't have time. Merlin! Don't worry, Gaius, everything's going to be all right. What are you doing, physician? What are you giving him? It's, er... It's a tincture, made from the lobelia plant. An ancient remedy for poisonous bites. A cure? We hope. Do you really think it will have some effect? It's our last resort, Sire. Perhaps you should allow him to rest. I will not leave him. Please, Merlin, you must beware. This is only the beginning. Arthur! The Prince lives. I thought we'd lost you. Don't worry, Father, I'm not going to die. I think there's someone watching Maybe you're right. On your long journey to become King, you'll need a guardian angel. I shall inform the court that their Prince lives. I knew it. I said you'd be all right. I can remember you talking to me. You can? You stroked my forehead. I was tending to your fever. Never lost faith. I was just talking. Tell me again what you said. I don't remember. Yes, you do. No, I don't. Come on. Something about the man I am inside. No, I never said that. Guinevere! I have to get these washed, Sire. THUNDER RUMBLES Aagh! Gaius! I'm alive! What is it? What's happened? Merlin, stay there. What's wrong? No, don't. Mother? Merlin... What's happened to her? She's gravely ill. Do something! If I could... Please, Gaius. Merlin, this is no ordinary illness. This cannot happen! Who did you meet at the Isle of the Blessed? Nimueh. Nimueh?! It was as you said. She demanded a price. But I bargained my life, not my mother's! Merlin, I wish there was something I could do. I will make you better. I will. You knew this would happen! You had me trade my mother's life for Arthur's! You said you would do anything. Did you know my mother would die? I knew the price would be a heavy one. But you sent me anyway. We need Arthur to live. I'm not one of you! We are both creatures of the Old Religion. It is the source of your power. What's that supposed to mean? Your destiny is to protect the young Pendragon until he claims his crown. And when he does, magic can be returned to the realm. Only then will I be free. So that's all you cared about? I thought you were my friend. I am more than that, Merlin. I am your kin. No, the only family I have is my mother, and you had me murder her. Her life has not been taken in vain. We will achieve great things together, you and I. For what you've done, I'll make sure you never see the light. Merlin! You...won't see me...again. Where is she? She's sleeping. I have to save her. You cannot. If the balance of the world needs a life, then Nimueh must take mine. No, Merlin. Yes. I will return to the island. You are young. Your gifts, your destiny, are far too precious to sacrifice. My destiny? This is my mother. My powers mean nothing if I cannot save her. You have taught me so much. You taught me who I am, taught me the purpose for my skills, taught me that magic should only be used for great deeds. But most of all, you have always taught me...to do what is right. Merlin... I need to say goodbye to Arthur. Ah, Merlin. How are you? Good. I'm pleased. Yes. I owe it all to Gaius. I need to talk to you. You still haven't got it yet, have you? I decide when we need to talk. Not today. I sometimes wonder if you know who I am. Oh, I know who you are. Good. You're a prat. And a royal one. Are you ever going to change, Merlin? No. You'd get bored. Promise me this, if you get another servant, don't get a bootlicker. If this is you trying to leave your job... No. I'm happy to be your servant, till the day I die. Sometimes I think I know you, Merlin. Other times... Well, I know you. And you're a great warrior. One day you will be a great king. That's very kind of you. But you must learn to listen as well as you fight. Any other pointers? No. That's it. Just... don't be a prat. Gaius had to go and get some supplies. He asked me to keep an eye on her until you got back. Thank you. I'm sorry. No, she'll get better. I've tried to make her feel comfortable. You've such a good heart, Gwen. Don't ever lose that. I'm gonna make you well again. I promise. You'll see. You're such a good son. But I don't want you to worry about me. I know that the Gods will look after me and that one day, I will see you again. I will miss you. I'll miss you, too. Gaius? 'Dear Merlin, 'my life is already near to its end. 'There has, for the most part, been very little purpose to it. 'Very little that will be remembered. 'In contrast, Merlin, your life is destined for greatness. 'Live by the tenets I have taught you, 'and I believe you will, in time, become the greatest warlock ever. 'To have known you has been my greatest pleasure, 'and to sacrifice myself for you is but an honour. 'You are, and will always be, the son I never had.' No! I never thought I'd see you here again. My Lady. It is a long time since you called me that. I've come to ask for your help. As you once did before, for Uther. You did not like the outcome. I offer a chance for you to atone for the death of his wife. I have saved the life of her son. What more do you ask for? That this time, you take a just price. Merlin intends to offer his life for his mother's. I want you to take mine in his place. Ha-ha-ha-ha! With all my powers of prediction, I could never have foretold this. Gaius the hero! Why should I grant your wish? You stood and watched as our friends burned in the Great Purge. Merlin is the one man who can bring magic back to this land. At Arthur's side, he can help forge a new kingdom. A world of peace and beauty that we can only dream of. And you're willing to give your life, Gaius, for the future they will bring? I'm waiting. Are you ready to die, Gaius? Gaius? For Merlin, I will give my life. Ic, seo heahsacerd, the acwelle strengthe ealdan aewfaestnesse! Stop! Back again so soon, warlock? What have you done? Your mother is safe. Isn't that what you wanted? Have you killed him? It was his wish. I bid my life for Arthur's, not my mother's, not Gaius'! The Old Religion does not care who lives or dies. Only that the balance of the world is restored. To save a life, a life must be taken. Gaius knew this. It is not the Old Religion that has done this. It is you. Come, now. We are too valuable to each other to be enemies. No! I share nothing with you. With my help, Arthur will become King. I will make Arthur King. But you will never see that day. Astrice! Your childish tricks are useless against me, Merlin. I am a priestess of the Old Religion. Forbearne! You too are a creature of the Old Religion. You should join me. You think I would join forces with such a selfish and cruel magic? Never. So be it. Akwele! Pity. Together, we could have ruled the world. You should not have killed my friend. Gaius! Gaius! No-o-o! No-o-o! Merlin... Merlin... Gaius! Gaius, you're alive! What did you do? Nimueh's dead. The balance of the world has been restored. You amaze me. You've mastered the power of life and death itself. We'll make a great warlock of you yet! So you believe in me now? Well, I would do...if... if you could... stop this blasted rain! Merlin! No! Aaagh! transcript:chocolate
