since it's family day. Speaking of, I was going to invite my mom so you could meet her, but she still thinks I'm a lawyer. The human being has a little human with it, how blood curdlingly adorable. We need to talk. What's wrong? Are you breaking up with me? Maybe we don't need to talk. I'm so excited for everybody to meet my sons. Not twins, I hope. They freak me out. - They know what the other... - Is thinking? - They're finishing each other's... - Pie. It's gonna be nice spending time with them. I don't get to see them since I started school. My sister jokes that they don't recognize me anymore, I joke that she's jealous because she's barren. My dad brings my cousin Abra, from Gaza. Does she look like you in a wig and lipstick? That's Halle Berry. Abra wears a full burka in public, she looks like someone covered head to toe in black fabric. Can't believe my grandma's rolling her old bones down here. I gotta pick a cabinet to hide in. - You hide from her? - She's crazy. Society programs us to dispose of the elderly because they can't buy things, but don't be blind to your grandmother's value. You need to cherish her. You cherish her. I'm sure I will. She's not gonna be around forever. I wanna believe you're right, but you never quite are, are you? Sorry. Was somebody canoodling with a certain professor? Actually, no. She dumped me. That's so sad. I'll give Jeff a shoulder to cry on, and you go put a dead bird in that bitch's glove compartment. Guys, sit. I don't need to cry, I'm fine. We're your friends. Let it all out. There's nothing to let out. I'm glad I didn't have to do the dumping. I'd have to lay low for three weeks to look sensitive and to avoid questions of overlap. But as the dumpee... I can start making out with every girl on campus right now. And all anyone will feel for me is sorry. - Not anymore. - Your heart's desensitized. Like a machine, it feels no love... just sex, like the Bootynator. The Bootynator... "I'll be back, but with Booty?" Why would the Bootynator be back with Booty? Wouldn't he try and kill it? Maybe he brings it back as a trophy. - Why would you want dead Booty? - I want pirate's Booty. Because you're hungry? I'll be back. But with Booty. - That's beneath you. - Gross. You're too gorgeous to be a teacher and too happy to be a student. - Take me to where your car broke down. - I'm here for family day. I'm looking for my family. I'm sure at the very least I can fill in for a creepy uncle. Amber. There she is! Look at you, all grown up. This is my stepdaughter. - Small world. - Actually, it's a very big world with five billion other women in it. Good luck. Come on, I'll show you around. - I'm back. - Without Booty. Now I feel sorry for you. - Feygnasse Team - .:: La Fabrique ::. 1x18: Basic Genealogy - Hands in the air! - Homeland security! Boys, leave that man alone. - Orange alert! - Sorry, they're just excited. You're Abed's father? I'm Shirley. That's Elijah, like the prophet, and Jordan, like the 14 time NBA all-star. - Gubi Nadir. - Is that how you say hello? That's my name. Sorry. You're like a black ghost. This is my cousin. Abra. Greetings. Over the course of 7 marriages, I've amassed 32 stepchildren. And obviously, Amber's my favorite. There was something about his mass emails that made me certain this would be a family reunion. Sure is, sweetie. - She's going to photography school. - That sounds... Keep it in your pants. You're embarrassing yourself. She may be hot, but she's my princess. Step-princess. Family day. Let's see what we got here. I can't believe Star-burns isn't a virgin. But judging from that bluetooth headset, his son is. Too cool for family? Everyone here is my family. Weak. Where's your family, el Tigre? My older brother will be at the barbeque. And it's none of your business, but I ate my twin in utero. Phantom menace, How's the trade embargo with the naboo? Anyway looks like Pierce broke the piggy bank at the escort service this time. Duck sauce, that was rude. The call girls I frequent are not nearly as attractive as my daughter. Stepdaughter. Technically ex-stepdaughter. - You know, your mother April... - Her name's Wanda. Was it Wanda? Yes. Hold on one second. Excuse me. The cards are on the table. Amber's the best shot I'll ever have... at something like a real daughter and I'm striking out. Have you told her she's prettier than a hooker? If you come to the barbeque... You'd never think of touching her... Maybe you could say a couple of cool things about me. You want me to wingman you with your ex-stepdaughter? I'm sorry. I got a thing. - You have a thing? - And it's on the rebound. I not subject it to a night with a girl that I can't have. You can't holster it for a friend? Pierce is barely a friend. He's no more related to Amber than you, and he was a jag about shutting me down. - How much effort do I rate? - For you? I'd break a light sweat. Good, I need a favor. Help Pierce with his stepdaughter? You're becoming dangerous. It's those doe eyes. Disappointing you is like choking the little mermaid with a bike chain. Is this nana Barnes? Troy didn't mention you were such a knockout. What's that supposed to mean? I'm sure you've broken a few hearts in your time. Tell me, how many men do you think I've laid with? - Who are you? - I am Britta. And I have offended you. And I am sorry. Is there anything I can get you? - You can get me a switch. - A what now? She's not family, nana. You can't make her get you a switch. She can make me get it, I just have to know what it is. It's a stick she can use to whup you with. Cherish, Britta. Cherish. It was wonderful meeting your brother. Adios, Se√±or Chang. Shalom, Rabbi Chang. And to both of you, sayonara. - Right? - Don't go. Ben, do you realize how ridiculous that sounds? That is who I am. So drop it! I'm dropping. Amber alert, you are allergic to peanuts. That might be a different stepkid. My flight actually leaves, so... Your flight actually leaves after I tell you a story called "Pierce takes on the school bully". - Are you a ninja? - Baby. - Don't be rude. - She's wearing a burka. It's a way for women to express their modesty, like islamic turtlenecks. Ask her if she wants to play with us. ... bouncy house. That sounds heated. Did she call him a pig's anus or something? She's saying she's old enough to jump in a giant balloon. She's saying he's overprotective. - Now she says he's a pig anus. - That fight made me crave a hot dog. Stay put, boys. I'll be back. You are a bad mother. Control your children. I have to go back to my car and get my emergency shirt. And I don't like that shirt! Not only did he join a band, They got jealous and booted him. Get out! That's exactly what they said. Off to the bathroom. Stepdad. - I've never been called "stepdad." - I don't think anyone has. Listen, when she gets back... find some reason why you have to leave. I'll beg you to stay, but you don't. Why don't you just leave now and cut our work in half? Good luck, buddy. You're leaving. - My girlfriend... is pregnant. - Pierce said you were gay. Yep, as the sunrise. I'm deeply ashamed. I'm glad I have friends like Pierce to keep... Honest. This is slightly wrong. - Too much tongue? - Just enough. But it's Pierce. You mean the guy who doesn't want men touching his ex-stepdaughter, but divorced my mom for our housekeeper? Could be the same guy. There you are. - Why are you here? - I go to school here, remember? There's a pictionary tournament in the student lounge. Sounds fun! Is Jeff joining us? - I don't know if he can. - I can't. - Come on. - Stay. - I can't. - Maybe I shouldn't either. - Stay. - Do you think I should? - I think you have to. - I stay. - Me too. - Good, family day. Whatcha doin'? Getting nana a switch. Stop pretending that my mean old nana is awesome. I'm not pretending. I think it's cool that she's got her own style of discipline. Nana's old school. Yeah, my mom told me there'd be white people that did this. With pocket watches, and coffee grinders, and pretending to be into steam boats. But let's get this straight. This is real life. My nana's gonna whup you. Not unless I find her a switch. How about this? Yeah, that's a great switch, Britta. Very hip. It should hurt a lot. Where's Elijah and Jordan? What a surprise that you lost them. - They're playing hide'n'seek. - Where? - That's not how it works. - Stop screwing. You want to yell at someone? Go find your crazy kids. My boy's disciplined. - It's not his job to... - All right! You got me, Gubi. I'm a bad mother. At least I let my kids be kids, instead of acting like a jail warden. You don't like a burka. I'm not talking about the burka. I'm talking about her never having any fun. Now Abra, you look me in the eyes, and you tell me... I'm sorry. I seem to have forgotten the napkins. Do you mind? Fine. Now I'm the napkin man. Circle. Circle with a squiggly line. A squiggly line circle. You heard me say "circle"? Smiling... sideways vagina. Happy... sideways vagina. Happy face. And that's a clam? - "As happy as a clam." - Yes! "As happy as a clam"? What a... gay guess. Idiot. Pierce, you're up. - Eat my dust, Winger. - You do know we're on the same team? All right, here we go... Look, I don't. You have to add more. You have to draw more. Stop circling the same thing. Guess what, you girlfriendless geek! - What are you drawing? - You're supposed to know, stupid. Relax... I'll get this. I think they'll both drop charges, we gotta take statements. It's gonna be a while. And I may just be a simple cop, but people need to know. This isn't gonna stop until pictionary bans the word "windmill". Pierce. We'll meet you at the gala. We're gonna go get some coffee. Is "coffee" code for sex? Is it? - Here's your switch. - Bring it here. I'll make do. Let me have it. I ain't no nun! Bend over. Drop your pants and get over my lap. All you have to do is walk away. What you doing? She's respecting her elders. See, did you think I was a hypocrite? That I wouldn't really... okay, that really... I don't understand you, Britta. I don't understand you at all. You know what? Totally wrong room. Will you get the door? She's had enough! She's had enough! Let's focus on you, the forbidden fruit that is the ex-stepdaughter of a casual acquaintance. Don't wanna lose that. Why do you have a $25,000 check from Pierce? - Tuition, for fashion school. - Not photography school? You caught me. Maybe I'll just buy a car. You just do that? Well, it helps that he's kind of desperate and stupid. Did you wanna be a good person? Or did you wanna be with me? There you are. Thanks a lot, Pollyanna. You made me hang out with Pierce and his stepdaughter. She's grifting him. She's what? She's taking a bunch of money from him. He give's for school, but it's for... grifting. Did you tell him? It's not simple. It's not? Gross! You're gross! You did it? Yeah, but not twice. I wanted to do it twice. That's gross! You met her this morning, You're faster than some bacteria. Are you doing this cause Slater hurt you? What? No, I'm not hurt. And Amber threw herself at me. You still have to tell Pierce she's taking advantage of him, don't you? When you think about it, nobody's getting hurt. Pierce's getting a daughter, Amber's getting allowance, I'm getting... we already talked about it. Don't forget, this is Pierce. He's a racist, homophobic, old goof. He does bad stuff all the time. Sounds like you've got all figured out. So why you talking to me about it? Because... you're... you know... - A decent person? - Maybe. You knew that talking to me would make you feel like a bad friend? You wanted to feel like a bad friend, because you wanna be a good friend? You really suck, you know that? Go get you and your brother some ding dongs and calm down. 'sup? - Did your family take off? - Yeah. Thanks for distracting him while we helped Abra and her burka. If a young lady wants to go in the bouncy house, she should go. You did a noble thing. I didn't do it. No, it was Jordan and Elijah's idea. They're good kids. If they weren't, they wouldn't be able to help Abra. I see why you were excited. You should be proud of them. You're a good mom. Oh, come on. Mom. Look what I got. Ding dongs are my favorite. Pretty rough? You were right. Nana's a monster. What did you say? I said you were a monster, Ma'am. And you said Troy was right. Get me a switch. Hey, stranger. Wanna pick up where we left off after I log some time with daddy warbucks? I thought about it. And what I want is for you to tear up that check, and go dance with your stepdad. Are you trying to get me to cut you in? You don't have leverage. If I walk over there and tell him everything, guess who he'll forgive. You. But I'd rather be the bad guy than watch you siphon him. How about this? I walk away, and if the check clears I won't make problems for you. I'll stay gone. Come back whenever you want. But be good to him when you do, because I'll be around. And I'm his friend. And you can be his stepdaughter... or not. I'll take the 25 grand. Over him, I'd take 25 cents. Have you seen Amber? Listen, Pierce, I gotta tell you something. She's not coming, is she? I wrote her a pretty big check this afternoon. I had a feeling she might... take it and run. - You want me to help you cancel? - She earned it. You're lucky. It's not too late for you. Have a family, share your life. That and understanding computers are two things you just can't knock out at the end. Who did you call last week after you farted on Vaughn? You. And who did Abed call after that squirrel stole his hot dog? - Me. - That's sharing your life. If you have friends, you have family. Come here, son. Are we hugging or dancing? If the roles were reversed, I would've had sex with your ex-stepdaughter. I did. Chip off the old block. It was either that or deal with your actual pain. What pain? 12:00. Are you kidding me? It's okay, it's okay. Let it out, We always used to watch the shows she wanted to watch. I hate <i>Glee</i>. I'm not crazy about <i>Glee</i> either. I hate it. I don't understand the appeal at all. - Why did we do this again? - We thought it looked fun. - Is your phone in your pocket? - I can't reach it. I can only move my right arm. there's money already there. Slide your arm through that bottom, and press the buttons g-14. When the snack is selected, the mechanical lever will be thrust forward, thereby knocking your phone out into the receptacle,
