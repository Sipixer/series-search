Can you help me with this? Thank you so much. I didn't mean to snap. Good morning. Many of you are halfway through your first week at Greendale and as your dean, I thought I would share few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration. What is community college? Well, you've heard all kinds of things. You've heard it's loser college for remedial teens, 20-something dropouts, middle-age divorcees, and old people keeping their minds active as they circle the drain of eternity. That's what you heard. However, I wish you luck! There's more. There's a middle card missing. Can we look around our immediate areas, 'cause I really wanted to... I'm only half-arabic. My dad is Palestinian. He's a US citizen. He's not a threat to National Security. People wanna know that after meeting him He is angry. Not at America. Just at my mom for leaving him. Although she left cause he was angry and he was angry cause she's American. My name's Abed, by the way. Abed, nice to know you and then meet you in that order. Now about that question that I had... 5 after 11:00 when you asked. What's the deal with the hot girl from Spanish class? I can't find a road in there. I only talked to her once while she was borrowing a pencil... Her name is Britta, 28, birthday in October, she has two older brothers. One of 'em works with children. She thinks she's gonna flunk her test, so she focuses. She's sorry if she seems cold. Holy crap. I see your value now. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. Absolutely not. These guys knew you like I did, they'd have given you a small office. Jeff Winger! Genius at law. - You got to stop saying that. - I will never do that. Sit down. I still cannot figure out how you got a jury to connect September the 11th with my DUL, let alone why that helped. Well, 2002 was a simpler time. So what is my lawyer doing here? I'm a student. That cannot be an inspiring journey. I am in a bit of a jam. The state bar has suspended my license. They found out my college degree was less than legitimate. - I thought you graduated from Columbia. - Now I have to get one from America. - And it can't be an email attachment. - Well, you've picked a fine school. And I'm hoping that our friendship will yield certain advantages. Academic guidance, moral support, every answer to every test for every one of the classes I'm taking. Here's my schedule. Now, Jeff, just by asking that, you have insulted the integrity of this entire institution. Waster! Not a bathroom! Duncan, you did seem less into integrity the day that I convinced 12 of yours peers that when you made that u-turn on the freeway and tried to order chalupas from the emergency call box, that your only crime was loving America. I do love America. I love it very much. - I love chalupas. - But? - I'll look into it. - Thank you. You are a good man. Jeff, are you familiar with the adage "cheaters never prosper"? If I wanted to learn something, I wouldn't have come to community college. - Spanish. - Don't hit on me, okay? I wouldn't dream of it. I wanted to let you know about my Spanish study group. The guy playing bejeweled on his iPhone all class has a study group? Can I sign up twice? I'm taking the class as an easy credit. I'm actually a Spanish tutor. - Board certified. - Can you say that in Spanish now? {\on more hour, do not scratch my car.} - I really need help with Spanish. - I was willing to bet. I'm Jeff... Or <i>jefe</i>. - The group meets at the library at 4. - Britta. Thanks. You're gonna be there? That means see you there. Shouldn't be too hard to fake a study group, right? I'm sorry. I was raised on TV and I was conditioned to believe that every black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor. Were you conditioned to pay for your damn tacos, Sein-field? Yes, I'm so sorry. It's Seinfeld. Bienvenido. Â¡Bienvenuto! All right, come on in. Got the whole table. - Got the whole room. - Here's the... Contact sheet. Just put your stuff there. Rest of the group is running late. But we can get acquainted. You may have noticed, not so good at the small talk. - I like big talk. What's your deal? - That's not small talk? What's your deal and is God dead? You want to know my deal? I dropped out of high school because I thought for some reason it would impress Radiohead. You'd be surprised what gets back to these guys. I joined the Peace Corps. Did a little foot modeling. I got tear gassed at a world trade rally. Marry me. And I guess, Jeff, my deal is, above all else, honesty. - Honesty? - Yes. Tell me the truth, I like you. Lie to me, I will never talk to you. - That's my deal. - A good deal. So what's your deal? I would have to go... I would have to say... honesty, because... I would say anything to get what I want and I want you to like me. That's a very honest answer. Now I like you. Really? - You're easy. - Yeah. Abed in the house! - Why? - Britta invited me. Is that cool? I can't think of a single logical reason why not. There you go. Here. Put your contact info down right there. That's right. - It's like <i>Breakfast club</i>? - We are in a library. We've each got an issue balled up that would make us cry - if we talked about it. - Have somethin balled up? I got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional. Text message. - Let's give this bad boy a read. - It's probably just for you. I've never gotten one of these. "Say you have to pee. I need to talk to you." - "Say you have to pee." - That is weird. - "Say you have to pee. I need to... " - Do you have to pee? - That's so weird. - I'm stumped. - Very creepy. - That makes two of us. - What's that? - Does it say you have to pee? No, it's just someone with a misguided grasp of abbreviation. I need five minutes, so go ahead and study all the... verbs in Spanish. Abed, what's your read on that guy? You look like Elisabeth Shue. Just act natural. Pretend you're watching the athletic proceeding. You couldn't stop me from watching them. There's a guy trying out for this team that is older than the game of poker. He's kind of trucking. Suppose I was to say to you it was possible to get those answers? I would say, "Go for that", and could have said so in a text. I'm asking you if you know the difference between right and wrong. I discovered at a very early age that if I talk long enough, I could make anything right or wrong. So either I'm God or truth is relative. And in either case, booyah. It's just the average person has a much harder time saying, "Booyah", to moral relativism. You don't have to play shrink to protect your pride. I accept. You're chicken. Are you trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist? I'm using regular psychology on a spineless, British twit. I'm a professor! You can't talk to me that way. - A 6-year-old girl could talk that way. - Because that would be adorable! No, because you're a 5-year-old girl and there's a pecking order. - Fine! I'll do it! - Thank you. Pleasure. Why am I still shouting? I'm drawing attention to myself. You guys aren't gonna believe this, but the rest of the group... is here. - Are you the board-certified tutor? - That means you do my homework, right? - I need to call my babysitter. - What board certifies a tutor? - Where's Britta? - I invited people from the class. - Cool? - It's the coolest. I'm gonna go to the bathroom and bring my jacket, wallet, and keys with me in case there's a fire. We go with him? Ileave my homework with Slumdog Millionaire. That's racist. And busted. - Listen. - Now you know. I'm a smoker. Yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe. Ready to get started? The rest of your group showed up. Not mine, actually. I think Abed took out a page on Craigslist. And I was trained never to say this, but I think that group may be untutorable. Really? So why don't you and I go study over... - Dinner? - Or drinks. I think, actually, we should prioritize here and study first and then go to dinner. If they really prove to be untutorable, we'll slip out early. They will be... untutorable. All right. Look at this crew. All ready to study all night. - Well, I can stay at least till 10:00. - But who studies with strangers, right? - My name is Jeff. - Jeff, it's a pleasure. My name is Pierce Hawthorne and yes, that is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne wipes, the award-winning moist towellete. - I was gonna ask. - Also a toast master, - so I should do the introductions. - Definitely! You already know Brittles. Abed. - Abed the arab. Is that inappropriate? - Sure. - Roy the wonder boy. - Troy. - Princess Elizabeth. - Annie. And finally, this beautiful creature is named Shirley. Is that even close? Why did I have to find out about this group on accident? - This is way more like <i>Breakfast club</i>. - There's breakfast? - Maybe we should get started... - I've been in a lot of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension. Shouldn't we address Annie's concern? Did we not invite her? - Sweetie, it's not behind your back. - Can we stop with the sweeties? Being younger does not make me inferior. If anything, your age indicates that you've made bad life decisions. - Shirley has a response. - I don't. I'm sure I've made some bad life decisions and maybe Annie's decisions will be better. But I think she needs to decide whether she wanna be considered a child or an adult, because children get pity when not respected. Adults, they get respect, but they also get their head grabbed and their face pushed through jukeboxes. Why don't we try learning "jukebox" in Spanish? - What are you doing? - Pierce! - Let's discuss this creepiness. - Pardon you? - What are you doing? - I'm certified. Are you unaware that Shirley finds your advances inappropriate? What advances? You have been sexually harassing me since the very first day of class. Sexually harassing? What? That makes no sense to me. Why would I harass somebody who turns me on? Saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude. I am a prominent business leader and a highly sought after dinner guest and I will not take courting advice from some teenage boy. Well, this teenage boy is a quarterback and a prom king. You're not prom king anymore, Troy. This isn't Riverside High. How'd you know I went there? Because you're wearing your stupid letter jacket and more importantly, I sat behind you in algebra. You're the one who got hooked on pills and dropped out. - You're little Annie Adderall. - Yes, and you are a stupid jock who lost his scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand. Keg flip. They're very hard to pull off. You don't know... I'm a legend. Know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the bender family. I got a carton of cigarettes. The old man grabbed me, he said, "Hey, smoke up, Johnny!" "No, Dad! What about you?" That actually was from the <i>Breakfast club</i>. Nobody puts baby in the corner. Dirty Dancing. It's professor Duncan. Come to the parking lot now. What's wrong with your voice? I'm disguising it. I'll be right back. But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out. No stone unturned. Go! Get in the car! Act as if we've either just finished or yet to begin driving. Every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester. I knew you could do it, buddy. Thank you. Whoa there, grabby-grabby. What do I get? The satisfaction of being even. Even, fairness, right, wrong. - There is no God. Booyah, booyah. - What do you want? Your Lexus. My car for a semester's worth of answers? Will it be just a semester though? Won't you be taking the easy way out for the next four years? I want payment in advance. I want leather seats with built-in ball warmers. You know, bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies. Have a nice disbarment hearing. - What am I supposed to drive? - Why don't you take this car? So is wiping your butt with a leaf, but it's not how a man gets around! It is a disaster in there. Yeah, untutorable. You like Thai food? I love it. Wait, so this is a game to you? You put human beings into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants? Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is? I'm sorry. It was an accident. I did a little bit of lying to get close to you. But how was I supposed to know that you were smart and cool? - You look like Elisabeth Shue. - You're unbelievable. - What do I do? - Maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess. If I do that, then dinner, right? Whatever. As if there's a dinner on Earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douchebag. You're gonna eat those words when you see my new car. All right, everybody! I want to say something. Sit down. You don't have to yell. I don't appreciate your tone. You know what makes humans different from other animals? Feet. Bears have feet. We're the only species on Earth that observes shark week. Sharks don't even observe shark week, but we do. For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve, and go like this. And part of you dies a little bit on the inside, because people can connect with anything. We can sympathize with a pencil. We can forgive a shark. And we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for screenwriting. Big mistake. People can find the good in just about anything but themselves. Look at me. It's clear to all of you that I am awesome, but I can never admit that cause that would make me an ass. But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome. She's driven. We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts. And Pierce. We need guys like Pierce. This guy has wisdom to offer. - The Dalai Lama and I... - We should listen to him sometime. We wouldn't regret it. And Shirley. Shirley has earned our respect, not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman. Don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was way too specific to be improvised. And Troy. Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is. You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? They're trying to impress their high school's prom king. And Abed. Abed's a shaman. You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup, because you know what? Soup is better. Abed is better. You are all better than you think you are. You are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself. Soup? Look at the person on your left. Sorry. Look at the person sitting next to you. Look at her? I want you to extend to that person the same compassion that you extend to sharks, pencils, and Ben Affleck. Say to that person, "I forgive you". You little twerp. I'd like you to say, "I forgive you". He didn't say it? You've just stopped being a study group. You have become something unstoppable. I hereby pronounce you a community. That's nice. This isn't like <i>Breakfast club</i>. Now it's like <i>Stripes</i> or <i>Meatballs</i>. - Anything with Bill Murray, really. - I agree tonight has been very special. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta. I lied. Thanks for calming everyone down. But since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me, I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time. Everybody ready? Fine. And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test. And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I've wasted more than they've wasted mine. If you have all the answers, why did you start this study group? I don't have a study group. I made it up. - The "look left" speech? - Made it up. I make things up and I got paid a lot of money to do it before I came to this school-shaped toilet. I was a lawyer. That explains everything. I thought you were like Bill Murray, but you're more like Michael Douglas. You have asperger's. "Ass burger." It's a serious disorder. If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis? - "Ass burger." - Burger for your ass. You may want to think about the gift you've been given. An excuse to punch a hippy? No, not that. An important lesson, my friend. See, the tools you acquired to survive will not help you here at Greendale. What you have, my friend, is a second chance at an honest life. Why are people trying to teach me things at a school that has an express tuition aisle? - Give me my keys. - I have to keep the car for the lesson. Don't hit me. Are we cool? We cool. I like you, Jeffrey. You remind me of myself at your age. I deserve that. I've been divorced seven times. Sometimes I think I'm doing something wrong. You keep getting married. I never looked at it that way. Shouldn't you guys be studying? Things got kind of boring after you left. Let me ask you something. People been clowning me about this jacket since I got here, but if I take it off to make them happy, that just makes me weak, right? Listen. It doesn't matter. You lose the jacket to please them. You keep it to piss them off. Either way, it's for them. That's what's weak. You wrinkled my brain, man. - He's good, huh? - He's real good. Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers? I don't have any of the answers. I'm gonna flunk the test. You just study for, like, an hour. It's not that hard. You seem pretty smart. You got a sports coat. Well, me. Funny thing about being smart is that you can get through most of life without ever having to do any work. I'm not really sure how to do that. What's going on? Can you guys hear me? Am I deaf? Can you hear me talking right now? That's good. You know what? Actually, we didn't get that far without you, so if you wanna come back upstairs. Really? Well, it is your study group, so. - Come on, let's study. - Sounds good. No pressure. I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas
