Three best friends... Head down first. I'll be right behind you, taping the whole thing And one innocent prank lead to an unthinkable betrayal.</i> - Did you get out? - Yeah. We're at the corner. Where are you? I'm sorry, I had to do this. Do what? We had nothing to do with the Drexler bombing. We were set up, and I have proof. This is a recording of some guy named Joseph telling Will to blow up the Drexler, saying he should frame Tyler and me for doing it, and the Drexler is just the first step in a much larger plan. Seems Traveler has left us quite a mess. You know what to do. He's an undercover federal agent. He's one of us. My father is working with the FBI, trying to have us killed. Freeze! Put your hands where I can see them! You drop the gun! Come on, Tyler. Let this man go. Jay, she's lying. The FBI is involved, I have proof. What I know is that you were telling the truth about Will Traveler. - We've got him on video. - Drop the gun! Come on, Tyler! You're not gonna shoot anyone! No, but I will. - You son of a bitch. - Shut up, Jay. - I'm here to help you. - Then turn yourself in! This is the guy who bombed the Drexler. Your friends are counting on you to do the right thing. - He's not our friend. - Tyler, keep your gun on him! You, put your gun on the ground. N.Y.P.D. has this area surrounded. Put your weapon on the ground and kick it over to Jay. Do it now! Grab the gun. Let's go. We're not coming with you. She tried to arrest you tonight. Jay, if you all come in together, it'll be a different story. The FBI is part of this. He's right. They're involved. You want answers? You want your life back? You come with me. You're making a mistake. Don't move. Up against the wall. Grab the fence. Move. Up against the wall. Grab the fence. Go. Get out of here! Damn it! This is agent Marlow. Suspects Burchell, Fog, Traveler... Last seen on east 16th street. All 3 are armed. - What's their lead? - Five minutes. Traveler's with them. They think we're headed east. Well, we gotta get off the island - before they close the city. - Just keep moving. Watch your step, please. We got a tip. Doorman spotted three guys matching our suspects' description coming out of a building. Don't even think about it, Marlow. You continually compromise this investigation. Tonight was no different. You're off the case. Burchell had evidence about the Drexler, - about people that knew that... - What evidence? A recording of Will Traveler getting orders to bomb the museum. - And where is it... this recording? - Burchell took it with him. Get back to the field office. All I wanna see from you today is a report. - That's bull! - All right, go ahead, Marlow! Keep pushing, and you'll be out of a job! Borjes, you're on point now. There's no phone line. The alarm can't dial out. Come on. Who are you? Answer the question! Who are you? Right now I'm your chance to make things right. Why? Why, Will? Why'd you do this to us? You used us! I came to help you get your lifes back. Trust me. Don't trust me. I really don't care. You put the gun down now. You hear me? He's not gonna shoot me. Are you, Will? Not till you get whatever it is you came back for. Pull the trigger if I'm wrong. Jay, you're bleeding. It's not my blood. Never seen a gunshot before? Was anything you told us true, Will? What about your... Your father? You said he drowned. Dead father was to get Jay to identify with me. What's your name? Traveler? Taft? One of these in your five passports? - Just call me Will. I'm used to it. - So you're some kind of spy? What government do you work for? Yours... At least I used to. I'll explain it to you once we get moving again. You think we're gonna follow you? Well, I don't think you really have a choice. You're not exactly 100% right now. And even if the FBI is involved, we can still take you to the cops. - You're not gonna do that. - Oh, yeah? Why not? Because I know him. You like to fix things. That's the reason you're here instead of Canada or Mexico. You wanna fix this? You come with me. Tyler, you drive. You know the city. There was a fight. How sure are we our guys were here? Tip puts our suspects within two blocks when the alarm went off. Looks like Marlow hit one of them. Should slow 'em down. And they're still walking away! We didn't have anything to do with the Drexler bombing. We were set up, and I have proof. What's this? Names of people who sold Holloway Insurance, who profited from the Drexler bombing. This is a recording of some guy named Joseph telling Will to blow up the Drexler. We need to get to Tyler's car. - We have a car. - We need yours. You want the car, then tell us why. No more secrets. You ever hear the name Jack Freed? Freed knows my father. he's on the list of people who benefited from the Drexler boming and he's former deputy director of the FBI. I'm impressed. After 9/11, Freed started a domestic espionage program called operation Hometow. Spying on American citizens. That's right. He recruited me into the program, then he left the FBI to help run Homeland security. Wait, what are you saying, homeland security's behind this? Freed's behind this. He picked you two as patsies. You were perfect... Two guys who had every reason to hate the government - for what happened to your fathers. - And you set us up. You don't know but I saved your lives at the Drexler. Did you get out? The bomb had a fail-safe. It went off anyway. You framed us, Will. I had orders to kill you. I kept you alive. We're supposed to buy this? Look, Freed's the one who took your lives away. He's the one who can give them back. I saw Freed yesterday with my father. In New York? Yeah. How do we get to him? I left something Freed wants in Tyler's car. That's why we need it. Kim told me the FBI found it. Then that's where we're going. Subtitles: swsub.com Our top story once again centers on Drexler bombing suspects Tyler Fog and Jay Burchell.</i> Eyewitness reports confirm that a confrontation took place</i> between the suspects and federal agents outside of lower Manhattan</i> approximately 4:00 a.m. this morning. The FBI have now implemented a series of checkpoints</i> at all access points to Manhattan, and limited subway access will be in effect through the day.</i> We want this mess cleaned up today. It's a go. I want updates from N.Y.P.D. and transit police. And from the hospitals. Already on it. One chance. You understand? You helped Jay meet with agent Marlow. I'm guessing you had something to do with the power outage at the club. Now Jay and his friends are on the run again. Where are they going? I don't know. Stand up. Turn around. I tried to help you, Kim. I told you what was best for Jay and what was best for you. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Looks like they're gonna move it soon. We need to do this. Where are you going? That thing is on a flatbed. We can't waste time. No. I'll do this. No way. Jay's going. Are you gonna shoot me, Tyler? After the week we've been through... This looks bad for you, doesn't it? What'd you say? Hi, Harold? Marlow. I need another favor. We need one more N.S.A. database search. I only have a first name... Joseph. Key words... Drexler museum, Will Traveler, Holloway Insurance, Fallbrook Dunn, John Ellington, Otis Whaley. I'll call you back in ten. Bye. What are you doing? Pushing paper, like I was told. You forced Chambers' hand when you went out on your own last night. - You could've at least called me in. - I made a judgment call. And it almost got you killed. We're supposed to be partners. Yeah, we are. We'll have 'em by tonight. This better be worth it. Come on. Get up! Come on! Come on! I look in my rearview, and there's this mook - jumping off my truck. - you sure it was Burchell? Absolutely. No doubt in my mind. And then his friends drove up - in the green 4-door. - He had something in his hand? Yeah, yeah, rolled up, about this big. - Any idea what that was? - I just drive the truck. Somebody else does inventory, man. Put up the Carlton Fog surveillance photos from yesterday. Suspects came back for their car. Rebroadcast the BOLO. They are travelling in a green SUV,</i> Jersey plates. Let's get Con Ed down here. I want a sewer check in case they went underground.</i> - They're not leaving the city. - <i>I am worried about that.</i> You think they're planning another attack?</i> Last time these three were together, we lost the Drexler. Why is the painting so important to Freed? I can't tell you what I don't know. We risked our asses for this? What I do know is that Freed wants this, for whatever reason. That gives us a chip. It gives us a hand we can play. It gives us a way to bring Freed to us. What's in it for you? We know what we want from Freed. What do you get? He took someone from me. Who? Maya? That's it, isn't it? You wanna kill him. He used me, too. Forget it. He's no use to us dead. This painting wasn't destroyed in the blast like everyone thought. If we connect it to Freed, people start asking questions. I know you are not that naive. Freed is never gonna let that happen. We're not killing the only guy - who can prove our innocence. - Wait. Stop. What if there's another way? 'Cause you kill Freed, and it's over. But if we can expose him, then we can make him suffer. - So what are you saying? - I'm saying, is that something you'd be interested in? Borjes, I've got those Carlton tapes cued up. That's Jack Freed, right? Former deputy director? Yeah, you're right. What's he doing with Carlton Fog? Wait. Who's that? Isolate him. More. No way. - Yes? - FBI. Special agent Marlow. - Oh. What can I do to help you? - Joseph Langdon? - Yes. - May I ask you a few questions? - About? - The Drexler museum bombing. Why don't you come inside? Nice house. It's my wife's doing entirely. I'm told I have no taste. I'll be quick, sir. You're employed by the crisis management firm Fallbrook Dunn? Well, I'm not on their payroll, if that's what you mean. - But, yes, they are one of my clients. - Meaning? I'm a consultant. I work for a number of firms. Do you know a man by the name of Jon Ellington? Only by name. I didn't know him personally, but that was a tragedy. I certainly hope you catch the men responsible. When was the last time you were employed by the firm? Is Fallbrook Dunn under investigation? Just a background search. It's part of the job. Excuse me, I'm gonna have to get that. Yes, this is Joseph. That's good to know. Thank you. Tell me who was on that phone. Give me a name. Give me a name! Bag this. And look for the number of the last person who called it. Whoever it was ordered this man to kill me. Put me through to Chambers. Sir, this is Borjes. I found evidence detailing contact between Carlton Fog and his son yesterday in Manhattan. - Where? - Fog's club. We had that place stacked out. Tyler Fog slipped into his father's limo. What's your action? I'm on my way to arrest Carlton Fog at his club. It's our best bet of finding Tyler's location. I'll meet you there. Sir. I have a call for you on the secure line. Who is it? A representative Trumble. I'll take it. And, uh, close the door on your way out. Good afternoon, representative. I have the painting. Are you interested? Well, it's nice to finally speak with you. It's been some time. Are you interested? This would have been much easier if you had just given it to us the first time we'd asked.</i> I want an exchange. But you know that I want more than just the painting.</i> Yes. Then you're okay with this arrangement? - Yes. - <i>Great.</i> Name the time and place. Washington Square Park. One hour. Come alone. We're good. Let's go. You get more presumptuous every day. Who told you you could come in here? You did, sir, by meeting with your son yesterday and not reporting it. I got it. All right, you listen to me. He is my next of kin. I'm under no obligation whatsoever to tell you anything. We'll let a judge decide that. Cuff him. - Get your hands off of me. - You under arrest for harboring fugitive. Do you have any idea who you're talking to? I do. Let's go. Borjes... Tell this man he's making one hell of a mistake. Not this time. I told you to tell me if you had contact with your son. Proceed with the arrest. Let's go. This your first big score, Borjes? Bet you already notified the press. Not my style, sir. I worked for your boss. No more talking. Get down! Down! Down! Get down! It's Whaley, sir! I got him! I got the shooter! It's Otis Whaley! Give me your radio! Stay with him! Call it in! That way, that way. Freeze! Drop the weapon! Put your hands on your head. Drop it now! I got him covered. Don't move a muscle. This is Whaley, sir. I know. Good work. Make sure you dispose of this. Yes, sir. You did good work, Borjes. Too good. This is S.A.C. Chambers, S.A.C. Chambers. I got a man down. Four men, Washington Square Park. Yeah, look out for any activity. I'm leaving now. I should be there in about ten minutes. Hello, Will. Keep going. Mr. Burchell... And Mr. Fog. What a surprise. You two have caused quite a few problems this week. Sit down. Is this where we share our feelings? Tell each other how much we've suffered, sacrificed? Sit. Don't forget who you're talking to, Will. Oh, I get it now. This is about Maya. You think I bear some responsibility for her death. You didn't have to kill her. Put it down, Will. That's not why we're here. Yeah, why are you here, Will? I thought we had an arrangement. Sorry. What? You were part of the bargain. No. I'm out, no questions asked. You don't come looking for me. I don't reveal what I know. What about the rest of our bargain? Give him the painting, Tyler. We trusted you. Give it to him. I Will shoot him, Tyler. Give him the painting. Give him the painting! What's the fourth branch? I know the history of the painting. Then you should know the evidence was to have been destroyed in the bombing. All this was about getting rid of a painting? No The Drexler bombing was about fear and control. This was just the beginning. Oh, Will. Then you should know the evidence was to have been destroyed in the bombing.</i> All this was about getting rid of a painting?</i> No. Clever. The Drexler bombing was about fear and control,</i> and this is just the beginning. So this is it, Will? You're gonna choose... two dead men over an oath you took for your country? Who do you think they're gonna listen to? Three known terrorists or a director of Homeland security? I'll say the tape was doctored. We've got enough evidence to get people's attention, to make them question the story they've been told. The police aren't gonna charge me. Yeah, but we're not taking you to the police. There are other ways of holding you accountable. The evidence and your confession. The truth about the Drexler will come out in the press. Let's go. You wanna know about the fourth branch? It's the reason your father served his country, Jay. What? It's the reason Carlton Fog offered up his eldest son. Don't listen to him. He's desperate. Will, you've been working for the fourth branch this whole time. - He's reaching. - I'm not reaching. Let me go. I'll tell you the truth about everything. Leave me here, the truth stays with me. Tell it to them. Agent Marlow? You wanted the last incoming number off the dead suspect's cell phone? Yeah, thanks. Who is this? Where are we? Where's agent Chambers? Where are you taking me? News desk. What do you got? The truth about what happened at the Drexler is in the black limo parked outside your front lobby. The man responsible is in the backseat. When you get to the car, call back at this number. Interesting. Be right down. They're on their way down. Okay, so if this works and the story gets out, then what? Then we keep telling people. It's gonna take a lot of convincing. It doesn't work like that for me, I was part of this. When the truth comes out, we'll tell people
