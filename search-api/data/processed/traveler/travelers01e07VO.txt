I'm sorry, I had to do this. You think Will framed us for this? Will apologized right before the museum exploded, and our faces are on TV. I'm not gonna see you again? Jay, you can't run from this. I need to figure out who Will Traveler really is. Seems Traveler has left us quite a mess. You know what to do. He's an undercover federal agent. He's one of us. We already know about you and Maya getting involved. Maybe we were supposed to die in the Drexler. What are you saying? That my father wanted to kill us? Not until I hear him tell me. You take off now, I won't be here when you get back. Don't do this. I have to. He's running! Out of the way! Wait, wait, wait! FBI! Get out of the way! - Where'd he go? - I don't know! There! Suspect heading west on 53rd. I need backup! Couldn't bring me in yourself, Jimmy? Had to leave it to Alex? Look, obviously there's been some kind of... misunderstanding Why'd you tell Alex I was coming? Somebody pay you? Come on. I'm just a supplier to you guys. You know I don't ask questions. Any sign of him? This is Chambers. We lost Tyler Fog heading west on 53rd street. I want roadblocks, bridge and tunnel closures... Whatever I can get. And tell N.Y.P.D. I need bodies down here now. All right. I'm gonna kill you. This is your last chance to tell me what you know. I told you, I don't know nothing, I don't know crap. I swear. Where you going, man? What are you doing, Will? Don't do it, okay? Will, you don't want to do this! All right, all right! I know something, okay? I know something. It's about Maya. Okay, the guy who killed your girl? He stopped here for supplies on his way to Deer Harbor. - Who is he? - I don't know! I don't know, okay? No! Oh, God! I don't know his name. All I know is he's got brown hair and he's all inked up, and he's out of New York. Okay? That's all I know. We good? Yeah. Where you going, Will? What are you doing? You gotta let me down. You reached Kim's cell. Leave a message.</i> Please, Kim, I don't know where Jay is... I thought that you might, and... And I don't... I don't know if he was at Eddie Hahn's when the FBI got there. I went back to get him, and I guess I was just... If you're satisfied with your message, please press one.</i> All agents and officers, gather around. If Fog is in the area, then Burchell must be close. I want random vehicle checks and a 3-mile grid search. Anyone answering to Fog's description, anyone wearing a hat, any male between the ages of 16 and 60, stop him. Search him. Transit police are covering the subway, we're gonna get this guy tonight. Let's go! Borjes, any news on Fog? I'll be right there. From the scene of a foot chase that took place</i> on the upper east side, FBI officials have refused to confirm reports </i> that they were pursuing Drexler bombing suspect Tyler Fog,</i> saying only that both Fog and suspect Jay Burchell</i> are still at large. What do we got? N.Y.P.D. spotted it on Roosevelt avenue in Queens, brought it here. V.I.N. Number confirms that it's Fog's. No idea when Fog left it there? Street cleaning was yesterday. It would have been towed any time before that. And nothing inside that explains why they would have come back to New York? Not that I could see. Why abandon the vehicle in Queens? Fog was in the city, not exactly nearby. It doesn't track. - Anything else? - You heard that surveillance picked up a phone message Fog left for Burchell girlfriend? Seems like Fog doesn't even know where Burchell is. Kim Doherty's from Queens, right? Chambers said that he convinced her to move back in with her folks. You think this is just about Burchell's girl? We already know about your indiscretions... You and Maya getting involved. - Let her go. - Unfortunately... I'll talk to him! I told you. I told you! It was a recording, Will. I killed her two hours ago. I killed her two hours ago. I'm gonna kill you, I swear to God! Subtitles: swsub.com Mr. Doherty, I'm agent Jan Marlow. No more. You have put my daughter... I know this has been a difficult time for your family, but I have some new information on Tyler Fog and Jay Burchell. - If I can just talk to Kim... - Talk to my lawyer. Dad, wait. Let her in. This is about making it right. It's about securing the future of this family. Without me? You're not strong enough, Tyler. What can I get ya? Three shots of whiskey and a bottle of stout. You know, I figure I'm going down. Might as well dull the pain as much as possible, right? What was that? Forget it. Yeah, that's right. I'm him. Let me guess, the man of my dreams, right? Afraid I've heard that one before. Have you? Well, maybe this time it's true. - Thanks. - You have news about Jay? Tyler Fog was spotted in Manhattan. - The news said that wasn't... - It was Tyler. We found his car less than a mile from here. Fingerprints place Jay inside. Wait. Jay's here? Well, that's what we're trying to determine. Have you heard from Jay or seen him in the last 24 hours? What about Tyler? Heard from him? No. Well, it must be nice having your family around in the middle of all this. I guess. My dad's a little... Well, you met him. He just wants to protect you... Just like you want to protect Jay. Thing is, you can't protect him, but I can. I can protect him. As long as he's on the run, he's a moving target. - But if he turns himself in... - Then what? I can help him, see that he's treated fairly, that proper procedure is followed when he comes in. That doesn't always happen with terror suspects. Something else, Kim. I know you were telling the truth about Will Traveler. What? I know Will exists, and I think he's still alive. And if you're right that he set Jay and Tyler up in the Drexler, then I think that Will might still be a threat to them. If Jay does try to contact you, give me a call, day or night. Does this routine usually work for you? Wait, routine? - Killer. Ouch. - Let's get out of here, baby. Wait, this is what you call okay? Seriously? - You got a problem, bro? - No. I don't, because actually while you were over there doing shots, I was over here enjoying this beautiful woman's company, so, I think it's you who's got the problem. I got a problem. No problems. - Nobody's got any problems, all right? - Come on, let's go, skinny, you and me. - Let's dance outside, bro. - There's my door. See ya, man. Dude, what is your problem, man? I had that. Oh, you had that. Easy, that guy had 30 pounds on you. Please. I got skills, man. I think you need to quit pulling this crap, 'cause one of these days I might not be around to save your ass. It's already paid for. "Kim Doherty"? - I didn't order any... - It's already paid for. I want that info now. You should've told me you were gonna question Kim Doherty. I didn't plan on it, sir, but when we found Fog's car, I put two and two together. - I didn't want to waste any time. - Waste time? What about all the time I've spend cultivating Doherty as a witness? - You consider that a waste? - Sir, I... What, are you trying to make yourself look better, trying to cut me out of the loop? Good. Don't. Listen, my shift's ending, if you wouldn't mind settling your tab... Anyone ever tell you you look like that bomber guy? I've been getting that a lot this week. I wasn't sure if you were gonna come. Neither was I. I missed you. - What? - I don't know. Hey, it's me. Talk to me. Please. Just... You don't know what it's been like since you left. I know. I know it hasn't been easy for you. I'm sorry. I got a plan, okay? And soon everything... Everything will get back to normal. Normal? Nothing is normal. Everything is different, everything is gone. Your career, my career... gone. Our apartment... gone. Our life together... gone... because you ran! I said I would come back to you, and I did. I got a message... from Tyler. What did he say? That he was looking for you. He said where he was? No. Carlton Fog set us up. What? Tyler's dad knew about the Drexler bombing in advance. Tyler didn't want to believe it, but... I'm pretty sure Carlton Fog's been in on this from the beginning. Tyler's father? - That's... - It's crazy, I know. I know. I don't know if I can do this on my own. You don't have to. That woman from the FBI came to see me today... Agent Marlow. Jay, she knows about Will. I think she believes there's more to this, that it's not your fault. Did you bring your camera like I asked? I found this stuff in Will's lock box. Will sure had us fooled. What? There aren't any pictures on this. You're right, but it does have an audio file. My camera's got a speaker, so... There is one aspect of this that we haven't discussed, and that's your roommates.</i> They will be framed for the bombing... And they are expected to die in the blast.</i> Oh, my God. Is that gonna be a problem for you? No. Not at all. Good, because there's no room for error, Will.</i> The Drexler's just the first step in a much larger plan.</i> Your country appreciates it. Thanks. You think Burchell and Fog coming to New York has anything to do with our John Doe? Otis Whaley? Possible. I got N.Y.P.D. watching the apartment where we found him. Still no hits on the B.O.L.O. Come here. You tell anybody he was a fed? Not yet. I'm still waiting to see if any of my leads pan out, but I think Chambers ought to know, don't you? Of course. It's just... What? It's just that I think it might be a good idea to keep a lid on this for a while. Pursue it on your own. Call it an instinct. We're talking about defying procedure. We're talking about an ex-FBI agent who escaped from our custody and killed one of our people. He's a subject of interest in the Drexler bombing. What if this guy still has contacts inside the agency? The minute you run this up the chain of command... Whaley and his contacts start covering their tracks. Why would Will keep a recording that implicates him in the bombing and in this much larger plan? Well, and what does that even mean? More bombings? I don't know. Maybe. Wait. What are you doing? Going to the FBI. Oh, Jay, it is the right thing to do. They almost caught Tyler today. It is just a matter of time, and agent Marlow said that she could help protect you... - Protect me? - I mean, if you turned yourself in, - she said that she... - No, turning myself in is... not exactly what I had in mind. Ed Carter? That's me. You work late? You'd be surprised the number of people who get drunk and decide they want a tattoo at 1:00 in the morning. Happy to help 'em out. First tat? I'm told this is your work. You know, it is gettin' kind of late. But you just said that... Thing is, my time is valuable. If you're not a paying customer... Know you're not lookin' for a bribe, Ed. No, not me. Yeah, I did those. On who? Guy's called Martin. That a first name or a last name? Don't know. When did you do his tattoos? Still doin' 'em. Takes a while to do a sleeve that elaborate. There's only so much pain a guy can take. Martin's got a higher tolerance for pain than most. When did you see him last? About a week ago. He's in and out of town, so it's taking me a while to get them finished. You know where I can find him? Said he stays there... Hotel Regal. Thanks. Hi, Kim. Everying okay? I need to talk... in person. I'm on my way. - Where are you going? - Kim Doherty. She's seen Jay. I know it. Well, hold on. I'll roll with you. I don't want to spook her. If it checks out I'll call you in. I've got three Tyler Fog sightings within a 2-block radius of 42nd street and 8th avenue all within the last five minutes. Make that four. Everybody, let's go! Pull up live feeds of every traffic camera in the area. Come on, come on. There! Who is that girl? Get me a visual I.D. Cross-check with the D.M.V. I want her name and where she lives, everything about her. Where are they? 43rd and 7th, heading south. I want all available agents on the scene, and notify local police units in the area. Now. We got him. 42nd and 7th, southwest corner, heading east. Times Square. Where are all the damn cops?. All units in the area have been notified. Should be any second now. They're not going anywhere. It's a live feed, right? There is a 30-second streaming delay. Notify transit police. Suspend all subway service out of Times Square. Almost every line in the city goes through there. - With a 30-second... - Fog could headed anywhere in the city by now. Damn! - Should we talk inside? - Actually, no... I can't talk. I have to get going. - I tried to call. - I didn't get a message. Sorry. So sorry. Go back. Push in. Got a name on this girl yet? So far, no matches with the D.M.V. Sir, doesn't it strike you as odd? What? Doesn't it strike you as odd that in the middle of all this, Tyler Fog is on a date? We need to talk. Certainly. Bring it back up. Maybe we missed something. Who was that? Robert Cole, head of O.P.R. handles employee misconduct. Thought Cole was out of D.C. What's he doing here? I don't know. Just tell me, dad, that you didn't try to have us killed. This is the real world, Tyler, and there are choices that have to be made. Some of those choices are bigger than you. Stay here and watch the house. I'm on this. Come on! You killed her. Who? Maya. I don't know who you're talkin' about. That's the worst part. Hometown? Then you know that I was just followin' orders. Who gave the order? I said who gave the order?! Who are we working for?! Freed! Freed gives all the orders. Look, Hometown's been shut down for two years. Freed's used us for his own agenda. You don't want me. Go after Freed. You got something he wants. Please. You made the right decision. Your girl Mary would have appreciated that. Her name was Maya. My office. Why didn't you tell me you sought increased security clearance to investigate our escapee? And when that failed, you received covert assistance from an N.S.A. Agent... Harold Stone? Agent Fowler was a friend, sir. His death... I took it personally, and I took it upon myself to find out about the man who killed him. I'm sorry that I strayed from procedure, but... No apologies necessary. N.S.A.? Very resourceful. I'm impressed. Thank you. Still, this guy... what's his name... Whaley Otis Whaley. I know agent Stone told you Whaley's ex-FBI. What I don't know is why you went to Stone about this at all. I could have gotten you that information without alerting O.P.R. I'm sorry, sir. With Burchell and Fog in the city... Unlike your partner, you've got an immaculate record. Don't ruin it. Agent Marlow has made it clear she wants my job. But you're former military. You respect the chain of command, correct? Yes, sir. Good. I want a full report on Whaley by morning. Will do. Who's that man with my father? Don't know him. I think he's up from D.C. "Carlton Fog with homeland security's Jack Freed." Jack Freed? "Homeland security's Jack Freed, former deputy director, FBI." This is proof, man, something to take to the FBI. I don't want to hurt you. I just want to talk. I'm listening. We didn't have anything to do with the Drexler bombing. We were set up, and I have proof. Kim, it's Tyler. Listen to me. You're breaking up. I'll call you back. Are you crazy? My phone's tapped. Listen to me. There's this guy, Jack Freed,</i> he's FBI. He used to be deputy director for god sake, okay? Now I think... I know he's mixed up in this. He's on a list of people who sold Holloway stock </i> before the Drexler bombing. Listen, my father is working with the FBI, trying to have us killed. Now before I took off, Jay said he was going to the FBI. - <i>You can't let him to that.</i> - No, it's too late. What do you mean? He's meeting with agent Marlow, now at... at Fervor. On fourteen? Okay, I'm going down there now. Oh, my God. you are that bomber guy. Looks like you got it all figured out. I gotta hand it to you, Burchell. Not a bad place to meet... loud, dark, easy to get lost in the crowd. And luring me here... you and your girlfriend make a good team. Kim had nothing to do with this. It was my idea. What's this? Names of people who sold Holloway Insurance, who profited from the Drexler bombing, a few of Will Traveler's fake passports. I see. That's nothing. This is a recording of some guy named Joseph telling Will to blow up the Drexler, Saying he should frame Tyler and me for doing it, and the Drexler is just the first step in a much larger plan. It's all very interesting, Jay. This could exonerate you. Turn around and place your hands on your head! I told you we've been set up. If you just listen to that recording... Unfortunately, this is about more than just the Drexler now. You're suspected of murder, not to mention the kidnapping of Tyler'susiness school friend Eddie Hahn. Jay, don't move! Everybody, stay calm! This is Marlow. I've got Jay Burchell at Fervor on 14th street. 1013, 1013, Suspect Jay Burchell has been spotted at Club Fervor.</i> 1013. Burchell's been spotted in the alley.</i> Copy that. I'm on my way. Freeze! Put your hands where I can see them. You drop the gun! I said drop your gun! Come on, Tyler. Let this man go and surrender peacefully. - We can straighten this out. - Jay, she's lying. - They're in on this. - What are you talking about? You have to believe me. The FBI is involved. I have proof. Yeah. See? She knows! I know that you were telling the truth about Will Traveler. We've got him on video. You were telling the truth about Will, and I think you were telling the truth about the Drexler, and with the evidence you showed me tonight... Don't believe her. You have to trust me. - Now you do as I say. - You drop that gun!
