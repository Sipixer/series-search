Come to us. Now you're quiet? You woke me up. Is that what he wanted? To talk to me? You have to help our family. What is it? What's wrong? We don't have our daughter. You must help us. Get our daughter. - Please find her.  - I'll try. You must do what you can. I promise. I'll do it. But you need to sleep now. You need your rest. There. Good night. I guess the no-caffeine diet's kind of killing you, right? No! It's not a problem. You didn't eat very much. Wait a minute. Are you having, like, morning sickness? No, no. Not yet. I feel great. You know, it's a beautiful day. I'm here with you. Oh, hey, about junior... Can I call him junior? You can call her anything you like. It's a girl? What, you feel like you're carrying a girl? I have no idea. Ok. Sam? Sam Lucas? Yeah, over here. That's me. Sorry. This is my first day and I gave you the wrong check. -No problem.  - I'm so lame. No problem. Really, it's no problem. So, ahh. Who do we tell about the baby? Delia. Come on, come to the store with me. We'll tell her together. No, no, no. Look, thanks, But that really seems like something You two should share alone, you know, In a high-pitched, girls only kind of way. Bye. - I can't believe it!  - I couldn't either! Oh! God, I can't stop screaming! Well, you can. You really can. - Ok, how far along are you?  - 8 weeks. 8 weeks?! Are you ok? Do you feel sick? Do you know the sex? No, I'm fine, and I don't know. Oh, honey, I am so happy for you. Are you gonna get married? When are you getting married?! Haven't even thought about it. Oh, right, right. 'cause it doesn't matter, does it? Well, you know, I mean, in my mind and in Jim's, too, - We are married. Oh, no!  - What? The chain, with the rings on it that I wear, it's gone! Oh, don't worry, we'll find it. It probably just fell off when I hugged you... Did I even hug you? No, you were screaming. - Excuse me.  - Come on in. Join the celebration. I'm looking for a doll, for my cousin. This is Drew. I'm Melinda, this is Delia. Hi. Welcome. I'm Emma. Anyways, Drew has some dolls. They're not exactly antiques, but they seem vintage. We've been to the toy store, But kind of an odd size. They need to fit in this chair. Wow, that is a very cool chair. She didn't want to bring them. They don't like to leave their home. I guess it doesn't matter if they match exactly, As long as they fit. And it's a girl. They only want a girl. The dolls have been talking to her. You know what, we have a lot of dolls over here, So let's go see if we can find one. Drew, right over here. Yeah, you know, and if we don't have anything, Do you know the make, or when the dollhouse was built? Oh, I don't. My cousin just found it up in the attic. Oh. Just sometimes we can go through the manufacturer, It was custom made. It's a model of the house I use to live in with my family. They died. - I'm so sorry.  - Me, too. Anyway, now I live with my aunt, Drew's mom, And...and I'm fine. It's ok. It was an accident. Carbon monoxide poisoning . I always tell people that. I don't know why. They never ask. Maybe it's because you want them to know your family didn't suffer. Yeah. Well, let's see if we can find anything. - It's Emma, right?  - Yeah. You know what, we have more dolls in the back. Why don't you come with me, And we'll see if we can find something. Ok. Any luck? No. Nothing yet. Your cousin says that your dolls are talking to you. She doesn't believe me. I do. I believe in a lot of things that other grown-ups don't. Are you sure it's your doll talking? Have you seen anyone else? You know, maybe somebody... that others can't see? No. Ok. So your dolls, what do they say to you? They're sad. Why? They miss their daughter. She wants a girl. They want her with them. I went online. It's true, Emma lost her family 3 years ago to carbon monoxide poisoning. They all died in their sleep. Leading cause of poison death in the U.S. Hey, I'm gonna get you a carbon monoxide detector for your shower present. Shower? You mean a baby shower? I already called Delia about it. You're planning my baby shower? Mango and berry, please. What, you don't think a man can do that? I can buy streamers and mix martinis as well as she can. Ok, but in the meantime, which there's plenty of, What did you find out from Detective Blair? You mean about the vision you have About someone slicing their wrist? Look, I know that their deaths could have been an accident, But what if they weren't? Oh, you're thinking murder-suicide. Somebody got so depressed that they took down their whole family? - I don't think so.  - What makes you so sure? Well, according to the medical examiner's reports, There were no marks on any of the bodies. Ok, so what about scars? There could have been an earlier attempt. Yeah, I asked about that specifically. They said that they were looking for the same thing... Suicidal tendencies, abuse. Could Emma be suicidal? Yeah, surviving the death of your whole family Would be hard to live with. Yeah, but they died 3 years ago, So why are they haunting her now? They're not. They're haunting the little girl, her cousin. Yeah, but that's only because she's young enough to still hear them. It doesn't tell us what they want. I thought they want their daughter with them, which is a nice sentiment, but they're dead. And if Emma keeps taking a slice at her wrists, They won't be waiting long. Yeah, I should get over there. I can't believe you found one. Thank you. You're welcome. I hope your other dolls like her. There you go. This is your new home. And you guys, This is...Ava. No. Chelsea. Wait. Daisy. She can be your daughter. So? What'd they say. Nothing. They don't talk when other people are around. But watch. When we come back, they'll be right where they always are. Where's that? The mom and the kids all go to their beds. And no matter what, the father ends up on the dining room floor. - Lying down?  - Like he's sleeping. But he doesn't look very comfortable. So you're saying that they move themselves? Yeah. And when did they first start talking to you? I don't know. Pretty soon after I found them. The dollhouse was all covered up. But I heard them. How long ago was that? 2 days ago. I was up here looking for a birthday present. For Emma. She's going to be 18. Drew, what are you doing up here? I wasn't playing with it. Melinda brought me a new doll. I was just putting it in there. I'm Lucy Stanton, Drew's mother. Hi. Melinda Gordon. I have a store in town, And your daughter and niece came by. Yes. The sitter told me. Drew, out of this attic. Now. If you don't mind. Who is this? What is that? That's not our daughter. Get rid of it. I spoke to Emma. She told me how she came to live with you. Is that why you kept the dollhouse hidden away? Emma told you that? No, she just said that it was a replica of her family home. It was. It's gone now. When my brother... When the family died, I was the only living relative. And Emma... I barely knew her. My brother and I weren't close. We'd had a falling out years ago. - I'm sorry.  - I am, too. Anyway, Drew and I packed up and we moved into the house, to try and keep things the same for Emma, But there were back taxes and the estate couldn't cover it. A developed made an offer, and I took it. They subdivided the property And they tore down the house. And that's why you kept the dollhouse? I've had it tucked away upstairs. I didn't think anyone would find it. Obviously it has some painful memories for Emma, but... I can't part with it. And there's a chance she may want it someday. If not for herself, then for her children. This may sound odd, Coming from a complete stranger, But has anything happened recently? Anything that might make you worry about Emma? I worry about Emma all the time. I'm sure if her parents were alive, they'd worry about her, too. You're wrong, all of you. She's nice. She would not do that. She wasn't there. Drew. You know your mom doesn't want you playing with that. And neither do I. Go on downstairs. Quick, come here! What? Emma's here! Hurry, hurry! Where are you? I'm upstairs Don't let her go! What's happening? She's here. Don't let her go. Lock her in! Lock her in! No! No! Drew! Come on! Get me out of here! Hurry, Drew! Drew said you were asking questions about the house. That it seemed like if you didn't know things, That you understood. I'm trying to. Could you explain it to me? Because I swear it's like they locked me up in that attic. That's why I had it brought over here. When you saw drew with the dolls, what was she saying? It was like she was defending someone, Saying she wasn't there. I think she was talking to your family. My family's dead. I think their spirits are attached to that house. Their spirits? Their ghosts. And I think that they're using the dolls To tell us something. Why didn't she get rid of that thing? She doesn't want it. She can't stand Drew playing with it. Are you talking about your aunt? Because she said that she was saving it for you. For me? Why would I want it? Because it belonged to your family. No, it didn't. It belonged to that house. What do you mean? I don't know, I thought some family before us Had it made. Because I never saw it until Drew found it. Look, I see things. Things that have happened, And I had a vision about your family. What did you see? Someone. Cutting their wrist. Wait a minute. You think that was me? Look, spirits stay with us sometimes out of love, Concern, Or guilt. I feel terrible about what happened. My family died for nothing, Because of some heating valve. And I got to live. But I would never hurt myself. If they're worried, tell them that. I would never dishonor them that way. I've gotta find those rings. You've checked everywhere else? Everywhere! And I can't tell Jim Because they're our wedding bands. So where do you want me to check next? I don't know. I've searched the whole house, And now I have to get it fixed back up again Before he gets home. So, how's it going with your little friends? Oh, you mean the dolls? Yeah, what do they want? Well, at first I thought they were blaming Emma for something. Yeah, and now? Well, I don't think so. You said the aunt lied about the dollhouse? No, I said that the niece had never seen it before. Ok, so how weird is that? You know? She finds a dollhouse. It's the exact replica of the girl's home, And she never shows it to her? Well, it was sensitive. You know, I mean, Emma's family died there. The thing's destroyed by developers. Developers didn't destroy it, the aunt did. - What?  - Yeah. I know that house. I used to have a bunch of listings up in that area. The whole neighborhood was in this uproar. No, no, no, no. It was subdivided for back taxes or something. - The house?  - Yeah. No, that doesn't make any sense. The family was loaded. You can check out the estate. It's public record. Ok, so then why would she destroy it? That's a good question. And what else is she lying about? Where is it? What? The dollhouse. What have you done with it? What difference does it make? What is the matter with you? Drew said she saw you packing it up. Ever since she found it up there, You've been such a bitch. Tell me where it is. You mean, my dollhouse? My cherished girlhood item? That's what you told that lady at the antique store. Why did you lie? What is it about that thing? Why do you even care? Why did you even agree to take me in? Do you have any idea what I have done for this family? Because of you! The dolls are not in the same place they were before. Yep. What, they just move themselves? Apparently. Oh, that is so weird. Are you gonna talk to the aunt? Well, since she's a liar, what's the point? I was hoping my friends would help me, If they want to stop freaking out their daughter. Are they here, right now? Well, I think this is home, sweet home. Do you want me to stay? No, I'm fine, thanks. Are you sure? Because I'm gonna go home All right. Good night. What do you want? What are you trying to tell me? I can't hear what you're saying. We kept our deal. Why isn't she keeping hers? Who did you make a deal with? With lucy? I don't understand. If people break promises, Promises will break them. Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Gordon, I'm here about a dollhouse. Sorry, this one's off the market. And how is everybody today? Not too chatty. No, not since they told me about some deal they made And showed me images of aunt Lucy cutting her wrist. You think the ghosts are trying to tell you That the aunt's in trouble. Well, they sounded angry, like she had broken some sort of promise. And then there's something else. This where she cut her wrist. Was she teeny-weeny? No. She was in the real house when I saw her. The walls were the same, the furniture, Which made me notice that in each room, Some of the parts were from the original house. You mean the house they were living in. Yeah, the one that the aunt had demolished. But look, the bedspread and the draperies, They're actually cut from the originals. The actual fabric. Oh, boy. - Is that hair?   - Human hair. It's wrapped around some of the other furniture, too. You said the dolls were talking to you about making deals, - Promises? - Yeah. You saw the aunt spill her own blood. Any idea what she did with it? Did with it? I think she was making a sacrifice... Maybe sealing the deal. Maybe sealing them in. Well, the blood makes kind of a paste. They say it glues the spirit's will to the practioner's. Rockland university is actually paying you to teach this stuff,Zoe? I'm giving a lecture in 20 minutes. Although I doubt you'd get a seat. It's a packed house. Thanks. I've heard enough of your lectures. And you were never usually very interested. What's changed? It's for a patient. Do you mind? Hey, you remember that time that I was grinding up All the egg shells with the fake blood? For your Haitian voodoo thesis? Vodou. In Haiti, it's "vodou." Ah, grad school. Good times. So, who's your voodoo priestess? Well, I wouldn't exactly call her a priestess. But...ha! You said "voodoo." It's the new orleans pronunciation. Mm-hmm. The blood, the artifacts, it sounds domestic. Spirit house? The dollhouse? You said this lady, what was her name? Let's just call her aunt lucy. Because that's her name, and she's an aunt. She demolished their real home, right? And now they have no place to go? Well, ghosts can live anywhere. Can't they? Well, there's one school of thought That if they can't return to the original place of their death, Wherever that is, that they'll be lost, Wandering the earth, unrecognizable to even other spirits for eternity. That's a bunch of hooey. Well, it probably is. Which is why what this lady did, It could have had the opposite effect. What do you mean? Well, she took a bunch of angry spirits, She tricked them and then bottled them up. That only makes them stronger. - And angrier?  - It would me. At some point, they're going to bust out, And when they do, it's not going to be pretty. Good luck. Hello? I hear traffic. Oh, I had to go by the archives. - What did you find out? - It's voodoo. Vodou. I don't know, however you want to call it. Lucy did something to trap the spirits in there. Well, you can't trap a spirit, But you can trick 'em. By making them think they can't exist outside their home. Well, she sure went to a lot of trouble to try to contain them. Exactly. Which means they must have been haunting the crap out of her. But why? Well, they probably know she wants the money. - There's money?  - Yeah, a lot. Delia told me that the family was loaded And the aunt was crying broke. I thought it was just another lie, so I researched it. That's a weird lie. I like people to think I'm rich. Yeah, well, she's not rich. There's money. Family money. It's the brother's, and then it goes to his kids. Uh, singular. Kid. It's just Emma now. Uh, no, actually, Lucy gets the money once all of his kids die. Wait a minute, you're not... you n't think... I mean, it was an accident. You're not saying that she actually killed them? There's a reason they all keep going back to the night of their death. The dolls snapping back to their positions. But the aunt is managing the huge estate. She must be getting something for the trouble. Yeah, she is. Until Emma turns 18, And then she gets everything. And Lucy gets nothing. Maybe that's why they trapped her in the attic. Maybe they were trying to protect her. Listen, I gotta go. Drew, are you home? Drew? Are you up there again? Drew! Stop it, whatever you are, please! Get out. You're next Good, you're home. Drew, the dolls up in the attic? I believe you now that they have been talking to you. What have they been telling you? I can't tell you. Drew, you have to. They're trying to warn me about something. They're only dolls! They're just mad at her because she Doesn't want me playing with the house. Mad at your mother? She just doesn't want me to break it. It's fragile. It's the antique. Drew, don't you know who they are? That was my house. The house my family all lived in. But they're just dolls. Who can talk, right? Because they are my family! Their spirits live in those dolls. Please. What did they say? They said my mom hurt them. And she's gonna hurt you. Oh, my god, that explains it. That's why she was surprised to see me alive that night. Listen, um, I gotta go. You know my cell phone number, right? - You sure?  - I'm sure. You're going to be ok. You're her daughter. But if anything ever happens, If you ever get scared, call me, ok? Ok. Bye. Mom? Dad? Are you here? Yes, honey. And we love you very much. It's ok. She'll be safe now. Honey, we have to go back. If we don't, Lucy will know. Hey, Ned. Thanks for watching the store. There's just one more thing I have to do. Sure. No problem. No sales, but someone came by and took that huge dollhouse off of consignment. The dollhouse? Yeah. Don't tell me, is that what you were going downstairs for? The lady said that it was hers, that she needed it. Lucy. Yeah, that was her name. Did I make a mistake? I'll be back. Drew... Drew? Emma? Drew? Sweetie? What is it? I'm scared. Of what? Of you. Oh, god. They're out. Drew! We have to leave! Drew? Drew. What's happening? Let her go. You think she needs protection from me? It's your family! What did you do to them?! - Nothing. Tell them to leave me alone.  - No! Drew, come on! You'll be safe, ok? - No, no!  - Stop! Stop it, do you hear me? Or I will kill her! Mommy! - Stop it, do you hear me?!  - No! Let Emma go, mom. Let her go. Mom! Stop... Come here. I didn't do anything! I never did anything! We saw you. Please just stop, ok? Your brother is here, and his family. Just please, I can help you. Just tell me what happened, whatever deal you made, Or whatever promise, it doesn't matter. If we don't stay in there, She'll destroy the dollhouse. It doesn't matter, it won't destroy you. I know that she said that, but it's not true. Just tell me what happened. You said that you saw her. The night we died, you were there. It was cold that night, And I kept pushing up the heat, But it didn't get warmer. Everyone went to bed very early. We were all feeling very sluggish. I thought we were coming down with something, the flu or... Good night, boys. Sleep well. I couldn't keep my eyes open, I was falling asleep so fast. Too fast. That's when I saw her. Moving from window to window, making sure she got us all. And for what? Money? Money I'd have given her if she hadn't been too proud to ask for it. Our parents cut you out, I never did. Wait, wait, wait. Something's wrong. He thinks that you killed him, All of them, for your family's money. He said that he saw you outside the windows that night. I was trying to help Emma. I saw a girl that night, coming out of a club. She was maybe 15. She was with an older boy, they were drinking. I thought it was Emma, But I couldn't be sure. It had been so long. I hadn't talked to my brother in years, And that was because of the money, it's true. But I was so worried. And when they didn't answer, I drove by. It seemed like they were sleeping, And I didn't want to wake them. And I found Emma's room. She was there. In bed. And I thought, ok, it wasn't her. Everything's all right. I was wrong. When I got the call, I realized when I'd seen them, they were dead or dying. And yet there she was. I couldn't believe my eyes. They're gone. I can't believe they're gone. I'm so sorry, sweetheart. And you didn't want to tell the police that you've been there, because then you would have to tell them why. Emma told the police she was spending the night with the girl friends And she'd come home early. When I was 15, I packed my bed with pillows And snuck off to see a boy I liked, too. But it didn't cost you your family. I should have been with them. I belonged with them! No! Emma, that is the last thing your parents would want. This is not your fault. You couldn't have saved them, even if you were there. All that matters is that you were here now. You are all that I have left of him! When we were kids, we were so close. Baby, I'm so sorry. I was so scared, but I never meant to hurt you. I would never hurt either of you. It's all right now. That's all right. We were angry. She was in our home. Raising a child we thought she wanted to... We thought you were going to hurt her. That's why you've been trapped. Not because of some magic spell. It's not your fault. You didn't leave her. You didn't leave her alone. She'll never be alone. Mom, there it is again. The light. Oh, honey. Tell lucy we're sorry. Tell them all we love them very much. I will. They're gone. Thank you. Where are those rings? Please, please! Hey there. I was coming to see if you wanted to have dinner. But, uh, is this an invitation? I'm stuck. Really?! Sorry! Oh, hang on. What's wrong? I lost our wedding bands. Oh. And I've looked everywhere. I mean, I tore the house apart. That's why the silverware drawer was on top of the oven. Yeah, and I kept them on a chain. And I wore them everywhere. I never let them out of my sight, Not even when I thought... That you and I could never be together again. But the thing is that, like I got out of the car the other day? You know, and I don't know, maybe the chain broke, Or, I... No, you were looking in the right place, You just were looking a couple days too late. Check your pocket. I found them on the floor of your car. I took this one to the jeweler. Why? I wanted to get it engraved. So that you would always remember, and that our child would know that what you and I have is... forever. If you'll have me. Melinda Gordon... Oh, will you marry me...again?
