YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME YOU THINK I'M YOUR HUSBAND REINCARNATED BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY SANE PERSON I'VE MET SINCE I WOKE UP. IT'S NOT MUCH, BUT MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ME FINISH MY GARAGE, AND YOU COULD LIVE THERE WHILE YOU DO THE WORK, JUST UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT YOUR NEXT MOVE. OH, MY GOD, IT'S TRUE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM, DO YOU? YOU MUST BE NICOLE. - THE FIANC? - SHE IS NOT HIS FIANC? UNTIL HE PUTS A RING ON HER FINGER. BYE. Hi. YOU MEAN, NIKKI REALLY LEFT? JUST LIKE THAT? YEAH. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT. AND SO AFTER SHE DROVE AWAY, THEN WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, IT WAS... INTENSE. WE JUST STOOD THERE, STARING AT EACH OTHER. THAT REALLY HAPPENS?

NOTHING COULD STOP WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. SO?! WHAT HAPPENED? I CALLED YOU. REALLY? PLEASE. WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. THEN YOU REALLY DO NEED THERAPY. IT'S JUST ALL BEEN SO CRAZY, YOU KNOW? STARTING WITH THE FIRST DAY WHEN I WOKE UP IN THAT HOSPITAL, AND THERE SHE WAS. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WAITING FOR! THERE IS NOTHING STANDING IN YOUR WAY. YEAH, NOTHING, EXCEPT THAT HE DOESN'T REMEMBER HE'S JIM. AND HE MIGHT NOT, MEL. BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S JIM'S SPIRIT IN THERE, AND YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO BE WITH HIM. YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S JUST STARTING FRESH WITH THIS NEW JIM, - IT'S SO... - WEIRD! I MEAN, I BARELY KN THIS GIRL, AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND, I FEEL LIKE I'VE KNOWN HER FOREVER. I MEAN, I WAS MARRIED TO THIS MAN. YOU KNOW? WE LIVED A LOT OF LIFE TOGETHER. I HAVE THESE REALLY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT HER! SO NOW I'M JUST SUPPOSED TO START FALLING IN LOVE WITH A MAN THAT I'VE ALREADY BEEN IN LOVE WITH FOR YEARS? HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK? WHERE DO WE START? A SCHOOL DANCE? I MEAN, THAT'S, UH...

I'M NOT SURE YET. - ?? - IT'S JAMMED! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - THAT'S HOT. - OH, MY GOD! ARE YOU OK? YEAH, YEAH, I'M FINE. COME ON, LET'S GO. ?? I SAID STAY AWAY FROM HER! THERE YOU ARE. I WAS WONDERING WHERE YOU WERE. - THAT LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE. - YEAH. www.1000fr.com presents Capture:summerwind Sync:iMeow</font> Ghost Whisperer Season 4, Ep 14</font> WELL,I KNOW THAT DELIA APPRECIATED US BEING THERE, EVEN IF IT WASN'T A PERFECT FIRST DATE. I THOUGHT IT WAS ROMANTIC. - REALLY? - YEAH. I SAW 2 BREAK-UPS, 3 HOOK-UPS, AND THEN ONE KID GET SICK ON HIS DATE'S VERY NICE SHOES. AND ALL IN THE SHORT TIME THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. I'M SORRY AGAIN FOR BEING SO DISTRACTED. - I... - DON'T BE. YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT THOSE KIDS. YOU CARE ABOUT PEOPLE. WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE? YOU HAVE TO STOP HIM. WAS SOMETHING THERE? NO, IT'S JUST I'M OFF THE CLOCK, SO LATER! - OK, LATER... - NO, I MEAN... WE ARE DONE WITH OUR... OUR CHAPERONE DUTIES, SO WHY DON'T WE HAVE A GLASS OF WINE LATER? WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS RIGHT NOW. OK. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. DOES IT? - SURE. - OK. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SEE ME. PLEASE, HELP. UH, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S LATE, AND WE BOTH HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW, SO MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THIS ANOTHER TIME. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S FINE, TOO. PLEASE, STOP THEM! I HAD A GREAT TIME, AND I REALLY THANK YOU FOR... FOR GOING. YEAH. - SO... - BYE. 'NIGHT. OK. WHAT DO YOU WANT? AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IT BETTER BE IMPORTANT! YOU'RE KRISTY'S MOM, AREN'T YOU? YES. YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT BOY AWAY FROM HER. - WHICH BOY? - TIM. THE ONE SHE DROVE OFF WITH. BUT IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO HELP HER. NO. HE'S BAD. SHE HAS NO IDEA WHO HE IS. OK, WELL, YOU HAVE TO TELL HER. I'LL HELP YOU. SHE WON'T LISTEN TO ME, SHE NEVER HAS. YOU NEED TO STOP THIS. YOU'RE IN EARLY, WHAT'S UP? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN AFTER THE DANCE? NOPE. NOTHING. OH, BUMMER. WHY NOT? SOMEONE'S MOM SHOWED UP. WHAT, SAM'S MOM'S BACK? NO, NOT SAM'S. A GHOST MOM. SHE WAS AT THE DANCE LAST NIGHT KEEPING TABS ON HER DAUGHTER KRISTY. OH, SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY WE CHAPERONED? APPARENTLY NOT. HER DAUGHTER LEFT WITH A COLLEGE GUY AFTER DRINKING SOME SPIKED PUNCH.PPU I ROUNDED UP ALL THE KIDS WHO WERE DRINKING, I CALLED THEIR PARENTS. DON'T WORRY, SHE HAD A DESIGNATED DRIVER. THE PROBLEM WAS, GHOST MOM DIDN'T APPROVE OF HIM AND THINKS HE'S BAD NEWS. SO ANY IDEA WHO THESPEOPLE ARE? NED KNEW THE GIRL. KRISTY FROM ORCHESTRA. BUT THAT'S ALL I KNOW. THERE WE GO. IT'S DEFINITELY MY GHOST. DEBORAH MARKS. SHE DIED A MONTH AGO, AN ACCIDENT AT THE HOME. WOW. THAT IS SOME POWER COUPLE. YEAH, SHE WAS A CIVIL LITIGATION LAWYER. ??? ?? FOR A SEAT ON THE APPEALS COURT. THAT'S WEIRD. THE GHOST'S HAIR WAS SINGED, AND I KEEP GETTING VISIONS OF ASHES AND BURNING. BUT IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A FIRE. OR ABOUT THE BOY SHE'S TRYING TO KEEP HER DAUGHTER AWAY FROM. SO DO YOU WANT ME TO ASK NED TO SCOPE THE GIRL OUT AT SCHOOL TOMORROW? THANKS, BUT MY LOVE LIFE CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG, IF I STILL HAVE ONE. HI. I'M REALLY SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, BUT I WAS A CHAPERONE AT LAST NIGHT'S DANCE, AND I WAS HOPING I COULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER. I HAD A FEELING THE SCHOOL WOULD BE SENDING SOMEONE. - COME IN, PLEASE. - THANK YOU. IF THIS IS ABOUT THE DRINKING, SHE TOLD ME THE WHOLE STORY. HER BOYFRIEND, OR RATHER EX-BOYFRIEND, SPIKED HER PUNCHED. JEFF. YEAH, WE FIGURED THAT PART OUT. I'M NOT SAYING SHE'S NOT CULPABLE. NO ONE MADE HER DRINK. BUT I HESITATE TO BE TOO SEVERE RIGHT NOW. HER MOTHER PASSED AWAY RECENTLY. I HEARD. WAS IT SUDDEN? JUST ONE OF THOSE FREAK THINGS. SHE TOOK A BAD FALL. WAS THERE FIRE INVOLVED? NO. WHY DO YOU ASK? JUST SOMETHING THAT KRISTY SAID. WELL, MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE PUNCH TALKING. I'M JUST GLAD JEFF'S MOM DROVE HER HOME. ACTUALLY, A FRIEND PICKED HER UP. AN OLDER BOY, HE WASN A GREEN CAR. THAT WOULD BE TIM DWIGHT. I APPRECIATE YOUR TELLING ME. KRISTY KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER SEEING HIM. OH, WELL, ACTUALLY, I THINK THAT HE WAS SAVING HER FROM A BAD SITUATION. I UNDERSTAND. BUT TIM IS NOT A GOOD GUY. THOUGH YOU ARE NOT THE FIRST ONE HE'S FOOLED. DEBORAH, MY LATE WIFE, WAS A GIFTED LAWYER, BUT HER PASSION WAS FOR HELPING TROUBLED KIDS, GIVING THEM A SECOND CHANCE. TIM WAS ONE OF THOSE. HE'D BEEN IN BRADFORD COUNTY JUVIE FOR ROBBERY TILL 8 MONTHS AGO. SHE ARRANGED A WORK PROBATION AS ONE OF HER ASSISTANTS. I GUESS SHE THOUGHT HE HAD SOME KIND OF FUTURE. AND YOU DISAGREED? LOOK, MOST OF THE KIDS THAT DEBORAH TOOK IN WERE BASICALLY GOOD, THEY JUST NEEDED A BREAK. BUT NOT TIM. HE CAME FROM A FAMILY THAT CARED ABOUT HIM. HE WAS GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY, BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER. HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF EVERY KINDNESS MY WIFE EXTENDED HIM. WE'D ALL HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF IF THEY'D NEVER COME INTO OUR LIVES. I KNOW THAT NOW. HELLO? - ARE YOU OK? - YES. I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST... THINKING ABOUT HOW HARD THIS MUST BE ON KRISTY. WAS SHE OR ANYONE IN THE HOUSE WHEN YOUR WIFE'S ACCIDENT HAPPENED? NO. DEBORAH WASN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. SHE WAS MEETING ME AT A CHARITY EVENT. RIGHT, I THINK I READ SOMETHING ABOUT THAT, WHERE SOMEONE WALKED IN ON THE BREAK-IN. NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED. THERE WAS NO BREAK-IN AT ALL. IN FACT, WHEN I GOT HOME FROM THE EVENT, THE ALARM WAS ON, THE DOORS WERE ALL LOCKED, NOTHING HAD BEEN DISTURBED. ??? SO, YOU THINK THIS BAD BOY TIM COULD HAVE KILLED YOUR GHOST? WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS KILLED, BUT IN THE VISION I HAD, IT LOOKED LIKE SHE WALKED IN ON A ROBBERY. AND SHE DEFINITELY ??? YUM, ANCHOVIES. OK, SO SHE MUST HAVE TRIPPED TRYING TO RUN, OR SHE WAS KNOCKED OVER, HIT HER HEAD ON THE ANDIRON. YEAH, BUT WHEN THE HUSBAND CAME HOME, THERWAS NO SIGN OF A BREAK-IN. NO, HE SAID THE ALARM WAS ON, THE DOORS WERE LOCKED, AND IT WAS OBVIOUSLY SHOCKING TO FIND HER THERE. YEAH, WELL, THIS TIM WORKED FOR HER. HE PROBABLY HAD THE KEYS, THE CODE, AND MAYBE EVEN THE SAFE COMBATION. HE COULD HAVE CLEANED UP AND LOCKED AFTER HIMSELF. HUSBAND NEVER EVEN SUSPECTED FOUL PLAY. DANG, I ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW, THE GHOST SAID THAT KRISTY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO TIM WAS. SO MAYBE SHE WAS SAYING HE WAS A MURDERER, BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE, WHY WOULDN'T SHE JUST TELL ME? MAYBE SHE DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE, DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK AT HIM. OR SHE WANTS TO PUNISH HIM HERSELF. NO WAY. IF A MOM KNEW THAT HER DAUGHTER WAS HANGING AROUND WITH A MURDERER, SHE WOULD TELL EVERYBODY THAT SHE COULD AND THEN SHE WOULD PUNISH HIM. I KNOW. SO I'M STUMPED. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HELP A GHOST THAT WON'T COME CLEAN? HEY. KRISTY, RIGHT? YEAH... OH, HEY, YOU USED TO BE IN ORCHESTRA. NED. - RIGHT? - YEAH. HEY, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT YOUR MOM. THANKS, BUT I'M COPING. HEY, I SAW YOU AT THE DANCE THE OTHER NIGHT. OH, YEAH, IF I DID SOMETHING STUPID, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. HELLO, MY MOM BUSTED THE GUY THAT SPIKED THE PUNCH. NOTHING TOPS OUT ON THE EMBARRASSING SCALE. UH, HOW ABOUT THAT CREEP WAS MY DATE? WAIT, SO WHO'S THE GUY THAT PICKED YOU UP? TIM. WE'RE JUST FRIENDS. HE USED TO WORK FOR MY MOM, WHICH IS WHY WE WERE JUST FRIENDS. SHE DIDN'T APPROVE. CAUSED PLENTY OF FIGHTS BEFORE SHE DIED. HE SEEMED COOL. WHY DIDN'T YOUR MOM LIKE HIM? NO, AT FIRST SHE DID. HE HUNG OUT AT OUR HOUSE ALL THE TIME. HE WAS LIKE A WORK STUDY KID. YEAH, SHE GOT HIM A CLERKSHIP, A SCHOLARSHIP. SO WHAT HAPPENED? I GOT KIND OF A CRUSH ON HIM. THANK YOU. THEY JUST WON THIS BIG CLASS ACTION SUIT AT MY MOM'S FIRM, AND WE WERE CELEBRATING. IT WAS ALWAYS FUN WHEN TIM WAS OVER. - SORRY ABOUT MY PARENTS. - IT'S OK, IT WAS FUN. WHEN HE WAS LEAVIN I COULDN'T HELP IT. TIM WASN'T EVEN INTO ME. HE SAID HE ONLY THOUGHT I WAS INTO HIM TO GET TO MY MOM, WHICH I DID. I CAN SEE YOUR MOM'S POINT. HE WAS OLDER. YEAH, SHE GAVE ME PLENTY OF REASONS. BUT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE. LOOK, I FEEL BAD TALKING LIKE THIS NOW THAT SHE'S GONE, BUT IF HE WAS SUCH BAD NEWS, WHY DID SHE KEEP PAYING FOR HIS SCHOOL, HIS TUTORING, HIS TRIPS HOME? SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM. OK, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. YEAH,I MEAN,I GOTTA SAY,THE WHOLE COUGAR THING IS A LITTLE OUTSIDE MY KICK ZONE. WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN IT EXPLAINS WHY THE GHOST IS BEING SO SECRETIVE. THANKS. - HELLO? - ELI, HEY, IT'S MELINDA. LISTEN, I'M TRYING TO DIG UP INFORMATION ON TIM, BUT I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING ONLINE. IS BECAUSE JUVIE RECORDS ARE SEALED. REPORTERS CAN'T EVEN MENTION THEM BY NAME. WELL, THEN I GOTTA TALK TO HIM. CAN YOU GET AN ADDRESS FOR ME? WHY THE RUSH? HE'S STILL IN TOWN, RIGHT? I GOTTA GO. I'LL CALL YOU BACK. HI! GLAD TO SEE YOU. - UM, HI. - HI, YEAH. THANKS FOR STOPPING BY. UM, CAN WE... LOOK, I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT, - AND... - WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? DID I MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE? NO. NO, NOT AT ALL. IT JUST SEEMS THAT YOU WERE A LITTLE SKITTISH, AND I WON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY. I JUST... I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL PRESSURED. NOT ATLL. OK? NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT, OK? THERE ARE NO SECOND THOUGHTS HERE. GOOD. 'CAUSE I JUST SAW ON THE MARQUEE THAT IT'S FRIGHT NIGHT WEEK AT THE LITTLE THEATER.YOU WANT TO GO? WAIT A MINUTE. YOU LIKE SCARY MOVIES? I'D REALLY LIKE TO FIND OUT. AND I'D ESPECIALLY LIKE TO FIND OUT WITH YOU. I'D LIKE THAT, TOO. - ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT TOMORROW? - YES! THAT WAS A LITTLE TOO ENTHUSIASTIC. NAH. IT WAS JUST ABOUT THE REACTION I WAS HOPING FOR. - 6:00 SEEM OK? - YEAH, 6:00 IS... IS PERFECT, OK? AND, UM, AND I'M GOING TO BE WORKING, SO YOU CAN JUST COME AND GET ME HERE. - OK. - OK. BYE, DELIA. - BYE. - BYE. WHERE IS SHE ALWAYS RUNNING OFF TO? OH, YOU'LL LRN NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY. OK? TIM? HI, UM, I'M MELINDA GORDON, I'M A FRIEND OF THE MARKS. IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG? NO, I WAS A CHAPERONE THE OTHER NIGHT AT THE DANCE, AND I SAW YOU LEAVE WITH KRISTY. ALL RIGHT, LOOK, SHE CALLED ME, OK? SHE WAS BUZZED. THAT CREEP WAS ALL OVER HER. I JUST WANTED TO GET HER HOME SAFE, THAT'S IT. YEAH, I KNOW. THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE, LIKE YOU WERE JUST HELPING HER OUT OF A JAM. SO WHAT? DID KRISTY'S DAD SEND YOU TO CHECK THAT STORY OUT? NO. ACTUALLY, I'M NOT HERE FOR HIM. I'M TRYING TO HELP THE FAMILY DEAL WITH THEIR LOSS, AND SO I WAS HOPING I COULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT MRS. MARKS. WELL, LOOK, SHE'S GONE NOW, SO REALLY, WHAT IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT? WELL, I KNOW YOU TWO WERE CLOSE. KRISTY SD THAT YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME TOTHER. MRS. MARKS WAS GOOD TO ME. SHE GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE WHEN I NEEDED ONE, THAT'S IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT. I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP. YOU KNOW, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOUR FRIEND MRS. MARKS SAID WHEN SHE BAILED ME OUT OF JUVIE. AND IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO REALIZE THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CHARITY. EVERYONE WANTS SOMETHING. OK, BUT YOU JUST SAID THAT SHE WAS GOOD TO YOU. SO WHICH IS IT? HE'S BEEN A REAL DOWNER LATELY. DID I OVERHEAR YOU SAY YOU WERE FRIENDS WITH MRS. MARKS? ARE YOU TIM'S ROOMMATE? I AM. BOY, HE WAS SULKING AROUND THE HOUSE AFTER THAT. REALLY? HE WAS UPSET? 'CAUSE HE JUST SEEMED PRETTY MAD. I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD HIS THING WITH HER. WHAT, LIKE A ROMANTIC THING? WELL, THE WAY TIM TALKED, MRS. MARKS WAS HIS MENTOR. BUT THEN ONE DAY, HER HUSBAND DROPPED BY UNEXPECTEDLY LOOKING FOR TIM, BUT HE WAS ON A BUSINESS TRIP WITH MRS. MARKS. AND MR. MARKS HAD NO IDEA? NOT THE WAY HE REACTED. HE WAS PRETTY UPSET. YOU SAID YOU WOULD KEEP HIM AWAY FROM MY GIRL. YOU DIDN'T KEEP YOUR PROMISE. BECAUSE I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU. DID YOU AND TIM HAVE AN AFFAIR? IS THAT WHAT ALL THIS ASH IS ABOUT? EMBERS OF YOUR LOVE? STOP IT. I ASKED YOU TO DO ONE THING. ONE THING! DID YOUR HUSBAND FIND OUT? WAS HE THERE THE NIGHT THAT YOU DIED? I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU! I DON'T WANT YOUR KIND OF HELP. STAY AWAY FROM MY FAMILY, YOU UNDERSTAND? ?? ??? EXCEPT IF HE DID IT, WHY WAS THE SAFE BROKEN INTO? I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF AN AFFAIR, YOU KNOW? OUR GHOST, HIS WIFE, CAME IN, CATCHES HIM, THEY FIGHT. YOU GET THE PICTURE, RIGHT? NOW SHE'S PROTECTING HIM OUT OF GUILT, YOU KNOW? AND LEST WE FORGET, HE'S A JUDGE. SO I DOUBT THE COPS LOOKED AT THIS DEATH OR HIS ALIBI VERY CLOSELY. YEAH, BUT IF HUBBY KILLED HER, WHY IS THE GHOST SET ON KEEPING TIM AND KRISTY APART? HELLO! DO YOU BLAME HER? I MEAN, IT MUST BE SO PAINFUL WATCHING YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER HOOK UP WITH YOUR YOUNG LOVER ONCE YOU'RE DEAD. I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS ABOUT JEALOUSLY. IT'S ABOUT A MOM PROTECTING HER DAUGHTER FROM SOMETHING BAD. WHAT AREN'T YOU PUTTING IN THERE? PICKLES. - CABINET. - NICE. OK, I SAY WE HAVE A WHODUNIT COUNTDOWN ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO FIVE, WHOSE PRINTS ARE ON THAT SAFE? STARTING WITH THE HUSBAND. OK, MAYBE THREE IS A BETTER BET. WHY DO WE NEED A VOTE? WHY CAN'T WE JUST HAVE IT CHECKED OUT? BECAUSE MR. MARKS WILL NEVER ALLOW IT. WELL, THEN MAYBE THAT TELLS US SOMETHING, TOO. NO. LIKE I TOLD YOU BEFORE, THERE WAS NO ROBBERY. NOW WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? I HAVE A GIFT. I CAN SEE GHOSTS, AND... THE OTHER DAY, YOUR WIFE'S SPIRIT WAS WITH ME. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. SHE GAVE ME A VISION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT THAT SHE DIED, AND IT LOOKED LIKE SHE HAD WALKED IN ON A ROBBERY. WHICH IS ODD, CONSIDERING YOU SAID THERE WASN'T ONE. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU BOTH TO LEAVE. THE SAFE BEHIND THAT PICTURE FRAME, IT HAD BEEN RUMMAGED. AND SHE WAS EITHER HIT OR TRIPPED OR FELL SOMEWHERE OVER THERE. THAT INFORMATION WASN'T IN ANY OF THE NEWSPAPERS. SOMETIMES SPIRITS STAY EARTH-BOUND. IT'S USUALLY FOR A REASON. I THINK THAT SHE'S PROTECTING SOMEONE... TIM, KRISTY, OR... MAYBE EVEN YOU. AND WHAT WOULD SHE HAVE TO PROTECT ME FROM? SHE DIDN'T TELL ME, BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHE WAS ASHAMED OF. MELINDA SPOKE WITH TIM'S ROOMMATE. HE SAID YOU'D BEEN THERE LOOKING FOR TIM BEFORE YOUR WIFE DIED. HE WAS WORRIED THAT YOU THOUGHT MAYBE THEY HAD HAD AN AFFAIR. OK, THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME REASON FOR WANTING MY WIFE'S MEMORY TARNISHED. ACTUALLY, WE THINK IT'S YOUR STERLING EPUTATION YOUR WIFE IS TRYING TO KEEP UNTARNISHED. YOU KEEP SAYING THERE WASN'T A FIRE, BUT I SEE ASHES; SOMETHING BURNING. WAS THERE ANYTHING MISSING FROM THE SAFE, ANYTHING AT ALL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BURNED? I HAVEN'T HAD THE HEART TO OPEN IT SINCE SHE DIED. I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF WHAT I MIGHT FIND. LIKE EVIDENCE OF AN AFFAIR? NONE OF IT MATTERS NOW. I LOVED MY WIFE, AND IF TIM HAD SOMETNG TO DO WITH HER DEATH, THEN YES, I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT. BUT IT'S NONE OF YOUR CONCERN, SO IF YOU'LL PLEASE EXCUSE ME... SO THE BURNING PAPER IN YOUR VISION, ANY IDEA WHAT IT WAS? IT WAS CHARRED, BUT I COULD MAKE OUT THAT IT WAS A WOMAN'S HANDWRITING, SO... SEE? CAN I CALL IT OR WHAT! A LOVE LETTER. IT'S GOTTA BE. THE GHOST COULD HAVE BEEN BURNING IT. TIM WALKED IN, THEY FOUGHT, AND KABONK! OR TIM COULD HAVE BEEN BURNING IT WHEN MRS. MARKS WALKED IN. OR MR. MARKS BURNED IT. WELL, ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT, THE PAPER WAS BURNED. SO SOMEONE WANTED WHATEVER WAS ON IT TO BE KEPT A SECRET. YEAH, AND THE GHOST STILL DOES. OOH, I'LL GET IT. MAYBE SAM IS EARLY. KRISTY! WHAT'S WRONG? - HOW COULD YOU DO THIS? - DO WHAT? THE COPS JUST TOOK TIM IN FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT SOME SUPPOSED ROBBERY AT MY HOUSE! MY DAD HAD THE SAFE FINGERPRINTED BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID! WELL, IF HIS FINGERPRINTS WERE THERE... OF COURSE THEY WERE THERE! HE WAS MY MOM'S ASSISTANT! KRISTY, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE UPSET, BUT MAYBE YOUR FEELINGS FOR TIM ARE CLOUDING YOUR JUDGMENT. HE'S INNOCENT! HE WAS WITH ME, WE WERE AT THE BOOKSTORE. - DID YOU TELL YOUR DAD THAT? - YEAH. MY DAD THINKS THAT I'M JUST LYING TO PROTECT TIM, AND HE WON'T EVEN LOOKT ME. LIKE I WOULD PROTECT MY OWN MOM'S MURDERER, THAT'S INSANE! LOOK, YOU KNOW THAT HE HAS A HISTORY AND A CRIMINAL RECORD, AND MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE ISN'T WHO YOU THINK HE IS. I KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT HURT ANYONE. AND IF YOU DO TALK TO GHOSTS LIKE MY DAD SAID, WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK MY MOM? BECAUSE I DON'T THINK SHE'D TALK TO ME. SHE'S MAD BECAUSE I DIDN'T KEEP YOU AND TIM APART. WHAT?! SOMETIMES I JUST HATE HER. THIS ISN'T WHAT I WANTED. THEN WHAT DO YOU WANT? PLEASE, JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED, BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN FIX THIS. I REALLY WISH I COULD. BUT SOME SECRETS ARE BETTER LEFT ALONE. I GOT NOTHIN'. TIM'S STILL BEING QUESTIONED. DETECTIVE BLAIR COULDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING YET. WELL, DID THEY FIND ANYTHING MISSING FROM THE SAFE? WHAT PART OF "I GOT NOTHIN'" DIDN'T YOU GET? ALL RIGHT. SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU COULD PULL SOME WEIGHT IN THERE. NO, BUT APPARENTLY JUDGE MARKS DOES. THEY'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS A POSSIBLE MURDER CASE. MY GUESS IS, TIM'S GOING TO BE IN THERE FOR A WHILE. OH, I HOPE I DID THE RIGHT THING BY HAVING THEM CHECK THAT SAFE. DON'T BE SUCH A SOFTIE. YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF YOU HAD A VISION OF MRS. MARKS WALKING IN ON A BREAK-IN. TIM'S PRINTS ARE ALL OVER THAT SAFE, OK? HE SEEMS PRETTY GUILTY TO ME. YEAH, BUT... AND PLEASE DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS BECAUSE DEBORAH NEVER ACTUALLY SAID SHE SAW TIM DO IT. WE BOTH KNOW SHE JUST SAYING WHAT SHE DID. OK, STILL... AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR PLEAS THAT KRISTY SAID SHE SWEARS HE WAS WITH HER. SHE'S NO MORE RELIABLE THAN HER MOTHER. EXCEPT... DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE FALLING FOR TIM, TOO. NO! ALL RIGHT? I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK OUT LOUD, WHICH WOULD BE EASIER WITHOUT SO MANY INTERRUPTIONS. SORRY. THE GHOST SAID THAT KRISTY DOESN'T KNOW WHO TIM IS, SO COULDN'T THAT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS RECORD? I MEAN, MAYBE THAT'S WHAT SHE BURNED. - THE POLICE REPORT, OR... - WHICH WE CAN'T ACCESS. YEAH, BUT WE COULD TALK TO SOMEBODY WHO KNEW HIM, HIS MOM ONLY LIVES LIKE AN HOUR AWAY... CRAP! MY DATE WITH SAM! I ALMOST FORGOT. I KNEW YOU DIDN'T WEAR THAT FOR ME. I CAN'T CANCEL, OK? - CAN YOU HANDLE THIS? - I'D LOVE TO, BUT STARTING AT 3:00, I GOT BACK-TO-BACK CASES. FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT, IF I RUSH, I'LL MAKE ITBACK IN TIME. I ONLY FOUND OUT MY SON WAS IN TROUBLE AGAIN WHEN I CALLED HIS APARTMENT. TIM DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE UPSET, I GUESS. YOU'RE A FRIEND OF MRS. MARKS? YES. SHE THOUGHT A LOT OF YOUR SON. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. YEAH. SHE WAS A WONDERFUL PERSON, REALLY BELIEVED IN TIM. HE'S A GOOD BOY. THERE'S NO WAY HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER DEATH. BUT HE WAS ARRESTED BEFORE FOR ROBBERY. HE WAS INNOCENT THEN, TOO. TIM'S GIRLFRIEND'S OLDER BROTHER DID IT. SO WHY DID TIM TAKE THE BLAME? THE GIRL CAME TO HIM CRYING, SAID THAT HER BROTHER BROKE INTO AN ELECTRONICS STORE. TIM WENT TO STOP HIM, ONLY THE COPS SHOWED UP. HE KNEW THE OLDER BOY HAD 2 STRIKES, SO HE SAID HE DID IT. DO YOU MIND IF LOOK AT SOME OF HIS THINGS? IT MIGHT HELP. YOU CAN SCOUR THE WHOLE HOUSE IF YOU LIKE. I JUST WANT MY BOY'S NAME CLEARED. THAT'S TIM AND HIS BROTHER GEORGE. - OLDER? - MMM, BY ABOUT 8 YEARS. TIM WAS AN UNEXPECTED BLESSING. THE LITTLE PRINCE. THAT WAS TIM'S FIRST BOOK. THERE'S A PAGE MISSING. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? GOD KNOWS. IT'S A WONDER THIS THING HAS ANY PAGES LEFT AT ALL. TIM JUST LOVED THAT STORY. IT CAME HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL WITH HIM. WELL, THAT'S SWEET. USUALLY IT'S BLANKETS AND BOOTIES. I'M AFRAID THEY WOULDN'T HAVE FIT OUR TIMMY. HE WAS ALMOST 6 MONTHS OLD WHEN WE BROUGHT HIM HOME. WHY? WAS SOMETHING WRONG? NO, IT WAS JUST THE AGENCY PROTOCOL. TIM WAS ADOPTED. I RUINED EVERYTHING. IT'S OK. YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP SECRETS ANYMORE. I KNOW WHY YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT TIM, AND I KNOW WHY YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO BE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER. HE'S HER BROTHER, ISN'T HE? YES. TIM'S MY SON. IT WAS THE HARDEST THING I EVER DID,LETTING HIM GO. AND THEN WHEN I FOUND HIM AGAIN, IT WAS LIKE A GIFT. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. DOUGLAS AND I FELL IN LOVE WHEN HE WAS IN LAW SCHOOL. I WAS AN UNDERGRAD. NOT LONG AFTER THAT, I FOUND OUT THAT I WAS PREGNANT. AND HE DIDN'T WANT CHILDREN YET? IT WASN'T HIS. IT WAS SOMEBODY I DATED BEFORE HIM. SO I TOLD DOUG THAT I WAS TAKING A YEAR ABROAD, AND I WENT HOME TO HAVE THE BABY. I TRIED TO KEEP HIM, BUT I WAS 18, BARELY OLDER THAN KRISTY. IN THE END, I HAD TO DO WHAT WAS BEST FOR MY BABY. AND YOU NEVER TOLD DOUGLAS? I TRIED TO PUT IT BEHIND ME, BUT IT HAUNTED ME. I LOOKED FOR TIM IN THE FACE OF EVERY BOY HIS AGE. AND FINALLY I HIRED A PRIVATE DETECTIVE. AND HE FOUND TIM IN JAIL. I COULDN'T STAND SEEING MY BOY IN THAT PLACE. I HAD TO GET HIM OUT. SO WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL YOUR FAMILY? OR HIS? I THOUGHT MAYBE THERE WAS A WAY I COULD HELP HIM WITHOUT STIRRING THINGS UP. AND THEN KRISTY FELL FOR TIM. SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD TIME TO SAY SOMETHING. AND I WOULD HAVE IF IT WEREN'T FOR DOUGLAS' APPOINTMENT TO THE BENCH. SO I FIGURED I WOULD JUST KEEP TIM AND KRISTY APART UNTIL HE WAS CONFIRMED, AND THEN I'D TELL EVERYONE. SO THE BUSINESS TRIP, WITH TIM, THAT WAS REALLY JUST TO SPEND TIME WITH YOUR CHILD? YES. AND THEN A WEEK LATER, I LOST THE CHANCE OF EVER TELLING HIM THE TRUTH. I'D STOPPED BY THE HOUSE TO GET MY CELL PHONE. I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK IT WAS TIM. MAYBE HE WAS GETTING BACK AT ME ABOUT KRISTY. AND THEN I SAW THAT THE NOTE I WROTE HIM WHEN HE WAS A BABY WAS GONE. I PANICKED. KRISTY WAS ALWAYS GOING ON ABOUT HOW I WAS IN LOVE WITH TIM. I MEAN, MAYBE HE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A LOVE LETTER. SO I CLEANED UP. I COULDN'T LET ANYONE KNOW THAT TIM WAS THERE. I FELT SO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BREAK-IN, FOR EVERYTHING. I BROUGHT IT ALL ON MYSELF. AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW IT. I DOT BLAME HIM FOR BURNING IT. IT WAS THE MISSING PAGE FROM HIS BOOK, WASN'T IT? IT WAS CLOSED ADOPTION. A PERSONAL NOTE WASN'T PERMITTED. SO YOU RIPPED OUT THE PAGE, AND YOU GA HIM THE BOOK. I WANTED HIM TO HAVE SOMETHING FROM ME. AND I KEPT THE NOTE ALL THAT TIME BECAUSE IT WAS A PIECE OF HIM. DEBORAH, I... I DON'T THINK TIM THOUGHT IT WAS A LOVE LETTER. I THINK HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS, AND THAT'S WHY HE'S BEEN SO UPSET. HE WASN'T MAD, HE... HE WAS MOURNING YOU. BUT IF TIM KNEW THAT HE WAS MY SON, WHY WOULDN'T HE TELL KRISTY? UNLESS... HE THINKS HE'S PROTECTING HER. HIS SISTER. MAYBE THAT'S IT. AT SOME POINT, YOU BROKE INTO THAT SAFE, AND EITHER YOU OR TIM BURNT A NOTE THAT YOU FOUND INSIDE OF IT. JUST TELL ME WHY YOU WERE IN THE SAFE THAT NIGHT. BECAUSE... I COULDN'T LOOK AT MY OWN MOM ANYMORE. IT WAS SICK.SHE FALLS FOR SOMEBO THAT I LIKE, AND THENAKES IT SEEM LIKE I DID SOTHING WRONG. AND MY DAD WOULDN'T LISTEN. IT WAS LIKE I DIDN'T EXIST. AND I NEEDED OUT. SO WHY WAS TIM HERE? TO TRY AND STOP ME. KRISTY, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS. NO, I REALLY DO. WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF? WHERE IS IT? WHERE DOES SHE KEEP HER CASH?! ONE OF THESE THINGS HAS GOT TO HAVE MONEY IN IT! OH, MY GOD, SOMEONE'S COMING! COME ON, LET'S GO! THEN WE RAN OUT THE BACK DOOR. I SWEAR, WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAD HAPPENED TIM DIDN'T BREAK IN? IT WAS KRISTY? WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING WHEN THEY BROUGHT TIM IN TODAY? I WAS AFRAID THAT IF I SAID HE WAS HERE, IT WOULD MAKE THINGS WORSE FOR HIM. BUT I KNEW THAT HE DID NOT HURT MY MOM, BECAUSE HE WAS WITH ME THE WHOLE NIGHT. I DID THAT, TOO... TRIED TO HIDE THE TRUTH TO PROTECT MY FAMILY. BUT THE LIES HURT MORE THAN ANYTHING. KRISTY, YOUR MOM'S HERE. AND WHAT TIM FOUND OUT THAT NIGHT, SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW, TOO. HE WAS HER SON. SHE'D PUT HIM UP FOR ADOPTION WHEN HE WAS A BABY. HE'S... MY BROTHER? WHAT'S GOING ON? DADDY... YOUR WIFE IS HERE. AND THERE'S SOMETHING SHE NEEDS TO TELL YOU. I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND, WHY ME? I MEAN, THERE WERE PLENTY OF OTHER KIDS IN JUVIE, ONES THAT COULD HAVE USED THE BREAK. BUT WHY'D SHE PICK ME? I KNEW IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF WHAT KRISTY SAID. I MEAN, IT JUST WASN'T LIKE THAT. AND THEN YOU FOUND THE NOTE? I MUST HAVE READ THAT BOOK A THOUSAND TIMES. DON'T ASK ME WHY. AND I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT PAGE. BUT WHY HIDE IT? WHY HIDE IT FROM HER FAMILY THAT I WAS HER SON,FROM HER FAMILY? I COULD ONLY THINK THAT IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS ASHAMED OF ME. OH, GOD, THAT'S NOT TRUE. I CHERISHED YOU. SHE WASN'T ASHAMED OF YOU. SHE CHERISHED YOU. SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW HOW SORRY SHE IS. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOUR FAMILY WOULD DO, OR MINE. I'D BROKEN ALL KINDS OF CLOSED ADOPTION RULES IN CONTACTING YOU. SHE WAS SCARED. ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOUR FAMILY, AND HERS. BUT SHE'S HERE. I WAS ALWAYS SO SCARED. SINCE THE MOMENT YOU WERE BORN, LOOKING AT YOUR... YOUR FACE. I LOVED YOU SO MUCH, AND IT TERRIFIED ME. I WAS SCARED THAT... THAT I COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF YOU, OR THAT YOUR NEW FAMILY WOULDN'T BE GOOD TO YOU, OR WHEN I FOUND YOAGAIN, I WAS SCARED OF WHO YOU'D BE. I JUST WANTED SO BADLY TO DO GOOD; TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT. BUT IT ALL WENT WRONG. SHE WAS SCARED THAT SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEEDED. SHE REALLY WANTED TO DO WHAT WAS BEST FOR YOU, AND SHE'S AFRAID SHE DIDN'T. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU TELL HER SHE DID THE BEST SHE COULD. SHE'S LISTENING. SHE DID SO MUCH RIGHT. YOU GAVE ME A GREAT LIFE, AND A WONDERFUL FAMILY THAT LOVES ME. AND WHEN I NEEDED HELP, WHEN I GOT IN TROUBLE, YOU GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE. AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED. I'M GONNA MAKE YOU PROUD OF ME, I PROMISE. OH, SWEETHEART. I ALREADY AM. SHE SAID SHE ALREADY IS PROUD OF YOU. THERE'S ONE MORE THING. IN THAT NOTE THAT YOU LEFT FOR ME, I ONLY REMEMBER THE FIRST PART... "MY TIM, MY LITTLE PRINCE, ALL THE PLACES YOU'LL GO... " "ALL THE WORLDS YOU WILL SEE. "MY LOVE IS ALWAYS WITH YOU. "I WRAP YOU IN IT, "LIKE A PRINCE'S CAPE, MY SWEET, SWEET BOY." THE WORLDS YOU'LL SEE. MY LOVE IS ALWAYS WITH YOU, WRAPPED AROUND YOU LIKE A PRINCE'S CAPE, MY SWEET, SWEET BOY. SHE'S READY. SHE'S NOT SCARED ANYMORE. THANK YOU. ?? PLEASE LEAVE ME A MESSAGE AFTER THE BEEP.?? YEAH, HI.
