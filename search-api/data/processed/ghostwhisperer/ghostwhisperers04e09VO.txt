me this way, please. No. not you. - I will always love you, melinda. - Oh, please not you. I am so empty without you. - I'm not going anywhere. - No, you have to cross over. I don't want to. Jim, no! - You're back. - Do I know you? Look, I see the same guy that you see. Different hair, nose, eyes. It's not jim. I just know what I see when I look in those eyes, And jim is in there somewhere. He just has to be. Do you believe in the afterlife? Wait, you're not gonna tell me you think I'm your husband reincarnated, Because you're the only sane person I've met since I woke up. It's not much, but maybe you could help me finish my garage. And you could live there while you do the work, Just until you figure out your next move. Will you tell me what is going on between us? Do you know how lucky you are? You are gonna get a second shot at your one true love. Oh! Oh. Hey. You're up early. Hey, Sam. Yeah, just... you know. Trying to be good. Yeah, me, too. Get a workout in. You want to, uh... - Together? - Ooh, I don't know. - No, that's stupid of me. - I'm sorry. what? This is probably a time when, you know, you want to be alone. - After what you've been through... - No, it's not that. - Get your stuff together. - Right. Something you probably did with your husband, huh? in the morning? - I don't want to get in your way. - No. not at all. um... He worked a lot of weird hours, and liked to sleep in a lot. You're really not in my way at all. I should... well... Ah, nice work, Sam. um... Have a good morning. I'll run that way. I'll go this way. - See ya. - See ya. Why couldn't I just say "your legs are longer than mine, "and I might not be able to keep up. " What is so hard with saying that? Well, it's probably better than saying, "hey, You're the love of my life in a new body, "and every time I see you, My knees go weak. " Ugh. my knees, my legs. I fumble with words, it's like my voice gets shaky. I'm a total dork... whoa! Hey, Sam. - Hey. How you doin', Sam? - Hey, Delia. Hey look... I've had this stuff in my truck for a couple of days... unh! And I've been meaning to give it to you, but every time I see you, I just. Forget. It's not like I don't forget everything else I've done in my life, I mean. How to read a blueprint I made, - the name of my dog. - You have a dog? No. but, I mean, that's what I think about when I wake up, you know? Anyhow, this is all yours to keep, or sell, or toss. Wow, you've got some nice things in here. Where did you get them? Well, I got a job doing some demo on a big house off of route 18. They're getting rid of all the hardware - Do you have a first aid kit I can... - It's ok. it's just a cut. Here. here you go. You look a little pale. You have got to stop skipping breakfast. It's, you know, low blood sugar. Yeah. yeah. um, you said that there was more stuff? Yeah, in my truck, but... There's also tons more back at the site. - Can I go look at it? Yeah, - I was going there right now. Yeah, we started the job from the back of the house. I don't know if the owner wants to gut it or tear it down, but uh... I don't think you're gonna find too much high-end stuff here. - Is there water around here anywhere? - Water? why? Well, the tiles. I just was... I don't know. is there a fountain or a pool? There's a well right there. Is that what you were looking for? Why not, huh? It is a wishing well. Careful what you wish for. Are you sure this little girl is... - What do you call it? - Attached to him? No. But as soon as Sam made his wish, she was right out of the well, - Standing next to him, warning. - Warning you or him? Who knows? maybe anybody who comes by the well. But she was - definitely focused on him. - Well, do you know what he wished? You got me. It had to be to get his memory back. And if so, what's the problem? We all know it's jim's spirit. You know it. even I know. What? what's that look for? - Believing me. - So, what are you going to do? Stop worrying about myself and the things I can't control... Help a dead little girl whose spirit is stuck down a well. - Do you know if she ever lived in the house? - The last owner was a widow. She had children, but no daughters. The place is, like, 100 years old. So, you're searching for what? A missing or dead child over the last century? Basically. Or I wait until she appears again and then try to Figure out if her warning was a threat or a promise. It's still good. why are they tossing it? Contractor wants all new, you know? Man, I think I just lost an eardrum. You heard that? Yeah, it was Bob's truck. - But twice? - I don't think so. - Help me with this. - Yeah. Sam, you ok? yeah. It's Melinda. Hang on a second. - You just got in. How did you get... - Uh, naked? um, sorry. Let me turn down the radio. Sorry. I had the radio on a little loud. - Didn't you hear me? - no. um... Hang on a second. So, uh, hey. what's up? What happened? did you hurt yourself? Well, not that I know of. And nothing that my doctor here or the one back home knows about, either. What do you mean? I thought it had something to do with the car accident. But that turns out to be a straight up head injury. I mean, sure. It could cause muscle trauma. Why am I feeling it now? - When did it start? - Well, it's weird. The first time I felt it, I heard a car backfire. It was like a rifle shot. I heard it twice, but it only happened once. I'm sure I just imagined it, but... Well, don't brush it off. I mean, it could be a memory. You know? one that you want to forget, But it could lead to others. Well, I hope so. I mean, I'm going through all these boxes, All my old stuff. Just trying to jog something loose. And? I don't know. I listen to cds, I see pictures of people I'm supposed to have known, you know? I have a cell phone here. what do I do? I call these people and say, "hey. do you remember me?" 'cause I don't. You said that it happened at work. Were you near the well? Nah, I was in and out of the house, you know. Coming and going past the well. And has anything weird happened there? To you or anyone? - No. not that I can think of. why? - What about the owners? I mean, Have you talked to anyone who lived in the house? I'm just working for the contractor. What are you getting at? why are you so curious about the well? I... it's my business. In a way. you know? Antiques, wells... I mean, there's actually a market for that kind of thing, Believe it or not. I should go. All right. Sorry about being naked. Who are you? what do you want? Look, talk to me, but just leave him alone. I made your, uh, chicken with the tahini sauce. And a good salad. good, you're eating. Yeah. That's me. I am eating. Ugh. something that looks inedible And totally raw. Well, what'd you cook the chicken on? - On? a pan. - I mean what temperature? I told you for an hour at... Yeah, I did an hour. In the oven? In the oven? you... you said on for an hour. No. no, no, no. That was the pan searing. I said inside the oven at 425. Well, I didn't hear that part. Delia, I miss him so much. He's keeping his distance Because he thinks I'm grieving. And the truth is... I am. I just miss him. You know, and today... Today he remembered something from his life... I mean Jim's. or at least I think he did. Well, that's great, honey. No, it's not. because... He remembered being shot. You know? and I-I think... I think the ghost is responsible for that If that's what he wished for. I'm... I'm so sorry. It just scares me. You know, what he might have to go through To come back to me. and... What if he doesn't want to? He already came back to you. I want you to remember that. Jim did all of this for you. Could you just... Stay on the phone with me for, like, 5 more minutes? Then I promise we'll both go to sleep. Yeah, sure. We can talk all night if you want to. I warned you. Stay away from the well. My arms and legs. Did someone do that to you? Terrible things will happen if you don't stay away. So what is it about explicitly being told to stay away That inspires you to come running to this house? I can't exactly search for clues With everyone working here, especially Sam. How was she when you saw her before? One piece or chopped liver? She was all in one piece. Must have happened after she died. Yeah, for transport. For some killers, dismemberment's a fetish, But for most it's a matter of convenience. I mean, how else are you gonna stuff the body in the trunk? Your encyclopedic knowledge of the depraved Is awe-inspiring. And if you've got a crowbar in that snazzy little tote, I'll be impressed. They didn't even lock it. Come in. Look at all these newspapers. Oh, my god. Welcome to the nest of the giant pack rat. Who lived here? A widow in her sixties. Heart attack. You know they linked hoarding to perfectionism? It's ironic, isn't it? because people who have it End up living like this. Yeah. not the most inviting place For a kid to visit. Do you think that she was drawn to the property Because of the well? Maybe it's just where she wound up. Nearest dispose-all where the killer could dump her body. Wait. Swing that back over there. What is that? Forget transport. I'm thinking fetish. How long has this house been empty? I don't know. The widow died a few months ago. And has it always been empty, or could someone else be living here. I no longer care if the neighbors call the cops. What is this? They're wishes. A wish for new toys, A million dollars. A teacup terrier who won't bite. It's like they were all written by children. Santa would have been a better bet. Wait, look at this one. This looks like adult handwriting. "I wish he could know she was here. " I gotta say, It's awfully nice of someone who chops up a little girl To leave a note. for who? The girl's father? wishing he'd learn the truth? So nice of that old lady pack rat to save it. Um, she saved everything. Meaning she had no idea there was a little girl down the well? Meaning we don't know if there's a little girl in the well. I'm not going down that well. I don't care if you have flippers and a mask in that bag, - I'm not going. - Ok, fine. I just think she's haunting it 'cause it has something to do with her death. Good morning. - Eli, right? - Yeah. Sam, hey. - We were just... - We went to this, um... It's early, right? Yeah. it's morning. I'm... I'm just gonna read the sports. Maybe I'll remember what team I like. Oh, hey. Melinda? Remember you were asking me about the history of that well? You had a buyer or something? Yeah, right. Yeah. well, I asked around. it turns out That the contractors were hired by the old lady's son. He pretty much owns it now. He's staying at a place called the, um... Grandview Court. his last name's Ackerman. - Travis Ackerman. - Great. thanks. - Sure. - Can I ask you a... A strange question? What did you wish for? At the well? I can't tell you that. Might not come true. I cannot wait for this ghost to cross over as soon as possible. Let's go see that pack rat's son. Travis Ackerman. - Let me do it. - Are you sure? Yeah no problem. You said you called because you have a buyer For some of the items at the house? I thought that we got anything of value out of there. I was visiting a friend up there, And I saw these dolls. Dolls? Doll pieces. That's weird. Do you know what I'm talking about? There was a... a pile of them. You know? arms and legs. They were next to a box of notes, Or, um... wishes. Actually. I think. You know what? I... I do know what you're talking about. I found a bunch of broken dolls. They were yanked apart. Um, somebody left them with a note - At the foot of the well. - The well? Yeah, there's this old well on our property. It's a wishing well, actually. Neighborhood kids knew about it. I was already 15 when we moved into that old place, But, uh, every once in a while,I would see them out there. Of course,they would run the minute anyone from the house came out. - Why's that? - You know, uh, Old, creaky place near the new subdivision. We were instantly the spooky house. I was going through a bit of a rough patch at the time. And I kinda figured if I could help Grant some little girl's wish, why not? So I, uh, I took the broken parts... Which, big surprise, it sounds like my mother saved, And I, uh, I left a new doll. And the next day, it was gone. Did you have any idea who the girl was? No. I only ever saw her from a distance. She was alone. No more than 10, long dark hair. You know, the truth is I learned to keep my distance from that well. I kinda wish everyone would. Why is that? You'll think I'm nuts. It's unlikely. I can usually tell. All right. um... When I was 18, i... I got a full scholarship to an out-of-state school. And then I found out that my girlfriend was pregnant. I didn't say it was all your fault... You know, I saw my future slipping away. I would be one more thing that my mom could hang onto. You know, me, Allison, and a baby all stuck in that house. - And... - We will be happy. I wished. With Allison right there, I wished... That she weren't pregnant. I said I'd give anything. Allison's car was parked out front, Right along the side of the road. And these, uh, these racers... these cyclists Came flying down the hill. And she got hit. She lost the baby, and I went away to school And she never spoke to me again. So... Wish granted. But I'm sure that you don't believe in All of that stuff anyway. You'd be surprised what I believe. Let me tell you what a friend of mine saw down your well. So just like that the son agrees to drain the well? It was an easy sell. The ghost got the guy halfway believing She was real just by granting his wish. He feels if she's down there, the family deserves to know. Well, that's cooperative. Not what you'd expect from a brutal killer. I didn't get that from this guy. What about his mother? She seemed like a nice lady With an anxiety disorder. What? what am I missing? Well, I'm just thinking about the wish That Travis had granted. I mean, it certainly proves the ghost's point. Be careful what you wish for. Yeah, but what caused the little girl's death? Because she keeps warning us against wishes So it obviously has to be something that she wished for. That ought to be easy to figure out. A little girl who wished for something. Yeah, but maybe we have more than that. I mean, now we know when she lived, right? So what if she's the girl that Travis Ackerman saw leaving doll parts? The severed doll parts. It's got to be her. Yeah, but when did she go missing? Well, Travis said he was 15 when he moved in. Yeah, and he left for school when he was 18. And he's late 20s now. I mean, how many girls Could go deceased or missing in Grandview in a 3-year span? Gretchen Dennis. that's her. Missing since 1996. You were right. and, uh... It's pretty awful. I'm sorry. Thanks for doing this. Yeah. yeah, um... Is the girl here? I mean, the spirit that you saw? - No. - Well, maybe, now that they've found her body, she's at peace? It's a step. What did you tell the police? Just that I was having it drained before I sold the place. You know, it's an insurance hazard And I didn't want anyone getting hurt. Um, Allison? could... Could a ghost have done that to her? I mean, caused an accident like that? I don't know. maybe. I'm sorry. Help me! What? what is it? The little girl. She might not be the only one that died. That was fast. Neighbors have built a shrine already. Yeah, it's all over the local news. Gretchen's been missing for 12 years. Are we gonna go talk to the family? It seems a little soon. No, the ghost. Look at me, Clay! I hate you! look at me! Look at what you did to me, clay. I hate you, clay. What is it? what's wrong? He did this to me. He killed me. Who is that? My brother. I just can't believe that a little boy would slice his sister into bits. Oh, he could. You're the search queen. type in "sororicide". That's sister-killing. you'll get 100 hits. Clay may have killed her, but he didn't chop her. - How do you know that? - I just got an e-mail From my friend down at the morgue. Even after 12 years, her skeleton was still intact. There were some minor fractures, But nothing that indicated dismemberment. What about the boy? I mean, were there any other bones down in the well? Nope. one set of bones. But you said he was a vision, not a spirit, right? So that means what happened to him Was something the little girl experienced. Ok. What if the armless boy that you saw Was clay's first kill? And she witnessed it. So if those were her dolls that were chopped into pieces... That could have been a warning. She could have seen what her brother had done And she was gonna narc on him. And to shut her up, he threw her down a well? It's hard to believe. But I guess either way, we have to talk to the parents. Melinda, they just learned that their daughter Is never coming home alive. Yeah, but they also don't know that she still needs their help. and yours. Look, Eli, I'm serious. You're a very experienced grief counselor. You saw the news you're here to help, And you couldn't stop wondering about... Gretchen's relationship with her brother? Are you asking us how he handled the news? Oh. well, he can't even talk about it. But that's nothing new. Clay... Clay is so smart. He's such a good athlete. He was a great ball player. But when Gretchen went missing, he was devastated. He lost interest in everything. it was... It was like we lost him, too. How do you mean? "survivor's guilt". That's what the family therapist called it. I understand. But is it possible for Clay, Would he have anything specific to feel guilty about? In terms of Gretchen? did they get along? Well, they fought like any siblings. - He was older. - Typical boy. And Gretchen was such a little girl. It's gonna seem odd, but did she like to play with dolls? Don't most girls? What's odd about that? Did Clay ever do anything to her dolls? Not really. Well, they... no, wait, Aaron, they did. When, uh, when he was trying to get back at her For who knows what, he hid them. all of them. And Gretchen just about lost her mind. And that was all the ammunition he ever needed. Aaron, do you remember that? yeah. He used to do terrible things. He would hide them, hang them... Cut them into pieces? Well, yeah. I - I know that that sounds awful, But we just thought That's the way kids are. Aren't they? I have a delivery for Andrew's meatpacking. I'm-I'm looking for the main office. Third floor. I think someone's still up there If you need a signature. Oh, sorry about that. I'm on the clock. Thanks. you're welcome. No! no! No, no, help! Please, somebody help me! please! Hello? check this out. Can we talk later? I called the brothther, Clay at home and at work. He never called me back. So, basically you're calling to tell me That you have nothing to tell me. Sort of. you said the ghost was pissed - I'm just saying... - oh. well, that's great. Well, thank you. um, ok. bye-bye. - Morning. - hey, good morning. How are you? I'm good, I'm good. And this is for you. I knew you'd be in a bit of a rush. I wanted to get it to you before you, uh... Ate. or didn't. it's not too late. You're not gonna be late for work, are you? No. no, this is... It's really nice of you. It's payback for all the good stuff You got me from the store. eat up, now. How is it? good? bad? Did you use orange rinds in the waffles? Good! I did, yeah. orange rinds, Organic maple syrup, a little fruit, Roasted pecans. Wait. you're not allergic to those? No. No, it's just something my husband did. - Sorry. - don't be. Really. It's perfect. I'm sorry I keep bringing him up. it's just... How could you not? Look, you can talk about him to me anytime you want. Anytime. Which is something I have loads of now. time. Oh, that's right. I heard the news. - I'm sorry. - whatever. I guess all the work's been halted. So it goes. They found the body of a child in that well. You know, the well you were so curious about. I gotta ask you, um... What's the deal with that? Um, I don't know. I hope maybe the police can find out something. I was really talking about you. You know, all the questions you were asking about the well. And then when we were there, It's like you could sense something. I mean, it freaked you out. You're not psychic, are you? Uh, no. No, I'm not psychic. You're certainly popular. Hello, Eli. Mel. this time I have something. Clay's dispatcher just called me back. Seems our ghost has been hard at work Putting Clay on disability leave. What happened? He had an accident. I know you're gonna say I was getting ahead of myself, Reaching out to the brother Who probably killed his little sister. Manslaughter? murder? take your pick. How about you start a phone call with, "can you talk, or is this a bad time?" No. I want you to pick one, seriously. Oh, I get it. because Sam might be there. And you don't want him to know you have superpowers. - Right. - Got it. will do. But come on. you gonna pick or what? I'm inclined to go with manslaughter, Gretchen's death being some kind of accident. But there's something that keeps bothering me. One-armed joe? Ok, fine. that poor boy you saw with his arm cut off. You're thinking if Clay did kill his sister In some sort of weird, rough, freak tumble play accident, Who's the armless kid? Yeah, and how is he related to Clay? I called the school looking for a yearbook. See if you could I.d. old joe as one of his classmates. Then I remembered. Clay was a little league star. So maybe joe was one of the kids on his team. I don't know. maybe he's lost his arm In some kind of freak accident that Gretchen saw. - A double accident? - yeah. That's him. that's the boy I saw. That's one-armed joe? That's Clay Dennis, Gretchen's brother. I'm telling you, that's him. He can't be both Butcher and victim. Gretchen blames him, so he has to be involved somehow. Well, if he wants to hang onto the rest of his limbs, He'd better start talking. You know, the warning label on these Says that you're not supposed to drive. I don't think that's a problem. There's another warning you should know. um... I see spirits. I've seen your sister. she's angry at you. Ok. you saw my sister's ghost. Yes. And the fact that I talk to ghosts Is not something I like to admit Unless I feel like someone's life might be in danger. Look, lady. what happened to my arm? That was just a... freak thing. No, I don't think so. It's too similar to a vision that I had. You were a kid, 10 or 11. And that same arm was injured. missing, in fact. Ok, please stop. I know exactly what you're talking about, But how... Oh, my god. Because my sister told you. In a way. She showed me severed arms and legs. I had no way to connect it, Except to her dolls and what you had done to them. What I did to them. She tell you what I did to her? Did she tell you that? I was so mean to her. She was such a stubborn tag-along. She was always getting into my stuff. Move! There were times when I literally hated her. This one time, I was convinced that she slit my tires. What is the matter with you? I didn't touch your stupid bike! I didn't do it, I promise! So I went nuts on her dolls. Hiding them, hanging them. She'd run, tell my parents, And write down in this little notepad of hers, You know, about how she hated me right back. Writing those stupid notes won't do anything. Shut up and leave me alone. One day, I don't even know what she did To bug me, really, But I just chopped up all of her dolls. Mom! Clay killed my dolls! I got grounded for 2 weeks. I was home alone, Saw her latest entry. She'd torn out the page, but I could see the imprint. She wrote, "i wish Clay's arms and legs were cut off. " She wished for you the same fate as her dolls. And when my parents were gone, I made that wish come true. Help me! Is this what you wanted? what did you do to me? I tried to stop her before she could call my parents or 911. I heard the screen door to the kitchen slam. Gretchen, come back. it was just a joke. She was already gone. She didn't come back that night. Or the next, or the next. I don't know what I was thinking. She was 8 years old. I heard my mom sobbing every night. "how could this have happened?" I knew. But what I didn't know Was what happened to Gretchen After I scared her away. Do you? No. But I'll find out. I promise. I saw you talking to him. Gretchen, he didn't mean to hurt you. He's been scared for you ever since. I've been in the dark, In the cold. All this time I was afraid to go home. Because you thought your wish had come true? But he's fine. it was just a trick. - No, he's not fine. - he's alive, And I'm dead and it's all his fault. He would give anything to take it back. There are no take backs when it comes to the well. Ask your friend Sam. I don't get it. why is the ghost going after Sam? I thought she was mad at her brother. I'm dealing with an angry 8-year-old Who keeps changing the rules as she goes. None of it explains how she got down the well. She wrote a note Asking for the well's help in punishing her brother. That's how this all started. but then, Eli and i Found this With her dolls at the old house. "i wish he could know she was here. " - Did her brother write this? - no, I don't think so. Where are those tiles that Sam brought? I put them over here. I wasn't sure if you were serious About selling it as a garden fixture. What do the tiles have to do with any of this? This is how I'm gonna get Gretchen to tell me the truth. "make a wish of your very own. "hide it deep within the stone". Gretchen, you thought the well had real powers And that's how your brother got hurt. Can I speak to her? She's here. she's angry. Like she was the time that she made a wish Wanting to hurt you. Hide it deep within the stone. Is it still in the stone? I watched it fall away over time. Years and years I was down there. Because of you. Look, whatever she's saying, Please just tell her I'm sorry. She's sorry, too. Even if she doesn't remember feeling that way. When you thought your wish had come true And you saw your brother bleeding, Maybe even dying... You came here to take back your wish, didn't you? It was so hard to reach. You said there were no takebacks. You're right. Even though you want to, No one can change what's happened. But you can grant one more wish. You can help your brother forgive himself. All I ever wanted to do was be with him. No matter what he did. She always looked up to you. She wanted to be with you. But I was so mean to you. And you were just a kid. You were a kid, too. Will you tell him I love him and forgive him? I will. She understands now. That it was a horrible accident. Same goes for you. She wasn't in the well when your girlfriend had her accident. There was no spirit, no magic. You didn't make that happen. Yeah, I didn't need a ghost's help. I mean, I might not have gotten what I wanted, But I definitely got what I deserved. Allison, are you ok? Go away! - Allison... - get away from me! Still, I can't help but wishing... Wishing you did something different. So does she. Who? The woman who left the note. The one who came here With your daughter. Of course. The other note. "i wish that he could know she was here. " Wha... what other note? what is she saying? I think she's talking about your girlfriend, Allison. 12 years. and she'd been living here the whole time. In Lewiston. half an hour away. She was hurt. Let him think that she had lost the baby So she wouldn't force a child on him. Didn't she think he have the right to know? I think she wanted him, too. It's just, as the years passed, It got harder to tell him. So, the visits to the well. I guess so. So far, so good. right. What? is she here? Figured while I'm here, I might as well help people. Like your friend Sam. Sam? It was dark for so long. Now it's so warm and bright. What did you do for Sam? I gave him what he wanted. Something he really wanted. Turns out it was something he already had. What? A piece of his life back. Which life? Thank you. It's been kind of a weird day, And I didn't know who else I could talk to about it. Ok. I was going through all my stuff, And I found a key. I know it's strange, I've been hoping... Wishing for a clue. Something to tell me who I was. Right? Guess I got more than I bargained for. Are you sure this belongs to you? Yeah. My name was right on the receipt, Sam Lucas.
