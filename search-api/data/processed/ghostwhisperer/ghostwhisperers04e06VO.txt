that's owen. owen? is that your friend? he's a little boy. are those leg braces? is that what you meant when you said he was sick? why does he look so sad? because he says something very bad is going to happen. i-i don't mean to be dense,but i don't understand why you're asking me. why would i know this boy? he's not even real. sometimes kids will model imaginary friendsafter real people that they've met. so did nat ever see anyone maybe with leg braces? you know,it could have been from a while ago. maybe in the hospital when jeremy was sick? i have never seen nat with this boyat the hospital or anywhere. but i gotta say,i'm really proud of you,honey. i mean,my gosh... look at how creative you are-- owen's real. of course. in your mind,of course. mommy,i didn't make him up. well,let's take a look at these pictures. someone decided to give him a red shirt and blue pants-- but i didn't draw those. i just drew this one. wait,that one's in marker. those are in crayon. we don't have any crayons here. i know those drawings. don't you? why would i,mom? you drew them. there was a game you played that summer. a strange little game. with these drawings? with your made up friend. my made up friend? what was the game? it was sort of a word game,with a treasure hunt mixed in. you'd hide objects around,and they spelled out words somehow. wait,wait,i-- i seem to remember this, but it's a game that you showed me,mom. you showed me how to play. you took the first letterof each hidden thingand put it together,right? no,sweetheart,i remember distinctly. i used to think,goodness,my tricia's working awfully hardfor me to believe-- owen did it! he hid the clues. he still does. ok,nat.honey,look-- you know what,tricia,why don't you and i go and take a walk? am i supposed to believei just conveniently forgot all this? that i used to see ghosts,including a boy ghost i used to play with? all children believe in thingsthey stop believing in as adults. memories fade,and people have no room for it next to their logic and reason. but you do. well,i don't have a choice. ok. so let's say this owen is real. what now? we have to find out what he wants from you. other than wrecking my wedding? well,we're ok in one way--at least he wants to talk to you. now we just have to get him to cut to the chase,which is why i brought you here. here? is his voice in the babbling brook? does he use a tree phone? i remember my wedding day,too. i was also a little on edge. i'm sorry,i don't mean to be disrespectful. it's just,i'm so stressed out-- he's here. where? he's a little shy,so he doesn't liketo stay in one place at a time-- owen.hi. i'm melinda. look,i came here to tell youthat tricia, she is not having fun playing your game-- she's not supposed to. are you talking to him right now? whatever it is you want her to know,just tell her. no. ok,you don't understand. she doesn't have time to play your gamebecause she's getting married today. look,since the two of you can talk to each other, why doesn't he just play the game with you? no! what was that? she has to play. tell her if she doesn't,she'll be sorry. tell her! he says that you have to play. you're the only one. you know what? i know you're trying to help,but i walk down the aisle in 6 hours,and, uh,this is,uh,this is just too much for me. i'll see you back at the lodge. trish,honey,everyone's getting together outsidefor some candids before the ceremony. are you still obsessing over that seating chart? if i could think,i'd be done already. just tell them i'll be down in about 10 minutes. i'd better tell them 20. mom,seriously,if you don't stop... ok,fine. let's play. what am i scared of? any luck? sure would help if i had more than a first name. you tried cross referencing the lodge nameor the street name... yeah,sorry. of course you have. it's just trish is an old friend. i'm a little worried about her. you and me both. if we don't get a handle on this ghost soon... i know,don't say it. you guys seen trish?
