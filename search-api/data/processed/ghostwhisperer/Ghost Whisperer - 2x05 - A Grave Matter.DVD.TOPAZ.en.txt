I'm married. I live in a small town. And I own an antique shop. I might be just like you. Except that, from the time I was a little girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead. It's all right,honey. Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them. They're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living and they come to me for help. In order to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs. That looks great on you. With a top hat and a whip,fabulous. If you need help getting out of that, I'm right over here. God,I love halloween. My parents use to make such a big deal out of it. When I was a kid,they used to decorate the house up like this big movie set. It was so great. Were your parents into halloween? Um,my mother hated it. I don't know how my father felt. Oh,why not? He left when I was little. - I'm so sorry. - No,it's ok. You know what? I think this table would look nicer next to the window. - Can you help me? - Oh,sure. I love worked here. It's so sweet decorate like this. Ah, no problem. has anyone in your family died recently? What? Your extended family. It's pretty much intact? Yeah. Amazingly long-lived,my family. Both of my grandmothers are still alive, and I have a great-great uncle who's 102. Wow. Amazing! Everyone's still alive. Hey,do you want to see the great undead lipstick that I got for halloween? - Sure. - Let me show you. Oh,by the way,I am judging the pumpkin-carving contest at the school tonight. You want to come? I would,but I have plans with a friend. Oh,well,friends are good. The more,the merrier. She's not in a position to come,but thanks. Ok. I swear I put it in here. I don't know why I couldn't just tell her I was coming here. I mean,delia's a really nice person. She's got a good sense of humor. Maybe it's just kind of hard to talk about. I miss you so much,andrea. You will always be my best friend. Save a little piece of that light for me,ok? Ghosts! Ghosts! Ghosts! Ghosts! - This is wrong. - What's wrong? This. - Who are you? - This is wrong. - Where am I? - Look,I know that you're confused. It's only been a couple of months. - Not me. - Excuse me? I can't be here. I can't be. Yes,you are here. I just saw you come out of that grave. But it's not mine. Are you saying-- help me. I'm in the wrong grave. Can you see us? So,a cemetery.It seems like a natural place for a ghost. No,actually,it's not. Ghosts get their energy from the living. There's more ghosts in a shopping mall than at a cemetery. That explains all the lousy parking. Ghosts tend to go where the problem lies, and this ghost's problem is the cemetery. How does someone get buried in the wrong grave? Hmm. Makes you wonder what they're doing at those morturaries. Oh,you don't want to know that. No,I really don'T. So,assuming this guy is right, does that mean that the wrong body's in his grave? - Makes sense. - Then what could I do about it? Not much, unless you can find the family. I mean,they can order an exhumation. You're going to need a lot more evidence than,um, "I talked to a gst." Makes you wonder how they didn't know it was that guy. The body must have been pretty messed-up. Yeah. It was pretty bad. - Cold? - No. It's just kind of creepy. My work is usually on a higher plane. I'm not so used to the whole dead body thing. You want to try getting used to the live body thing? Ooh,that sounds nice. I don't want to do much talking here. Go. Go! Go away! I'm not him! Stop it! Excuse me? Wow,stop this weather! Something like this happens every time I come here. I think it's his way of telling me he knows I'm here. That's a really nice way to think about it. You look familiar to me. Have we met? My name is melinda gordon. I own an antique shop in town, same as it never was. Yes,I love that place. I bought a vase there last year from one of your employees. Lovely girl. Yeah. I'm shelby burris. And this is my husband steve. I'm so sorry. They say it gets better with time, but it doesn't seem to. No,it doesn'T. He was kind and caring. He loved to laugh. He sounds like a wonderful man. Were you actually there when they buried him? Did you get to say good-bye and see him one last time. Only in spirit. There was so much damage, it had to be a closed coffin. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. It's ok. It's better to talk about it than keep it bottled up inside. It was nice to meet you,melinda. I didn't ask,do you have a loved one buried here? Yes. The lovely girl from the store. Oh,I'm so sorry. Life is so fleeting, isn't it? You can be happy, things are going great,and then... a sudden bolt of lightning can wipe it all out. Yeah,that's true. Well,life is for the living,right? What are you doing here? That woman. She comes every day. She cries so hard... but not for me. Is that why you're trying to get rid of her? She thinks that you're her husband. But I'm not. - Who are you? - Godfrey. Adam godfrey. Do you know how you died? It was a flash-- bright,hot. I just--I don't-- I don't know. I know that this is hard, and you feel really confused right now, but it's going to get better. Do you have a family? Anyone who can help us? I was alone. I was always alone. Find my grave. Please. Wow,adam godfrey's a writer. What's that? Oh,sorry. Nothing. Adam godfrey? Great writer. Haven't you ever read lost delusions? Honey,I saw you look right at me yesterday. Don't pretend you can't see me now. I cannot talk. Sorry. I just had to cash her out. Did you need me? No,no. I'm just looking for this book,lost delusions. Oh,yeah. Our book club read that last year. Great book. But the author was kind of a one-hit wonder,right? Well,let's see. We all read it 3 or 4 times. We tried to get the country club to name a sandwich after the main character. It's about a young man struggling to find his ace in the world and failing miserably. Depressing,yet oddly uplifting. Yep,that's the one. I still have it at home, if you want to borrow it. By the way,e you hungry? Because I am starved. I totally lost track of time. Please go to lunch. I'll cover for you. Did you and andrea ever just close up for a bit and go and have lunch together. You know what? I-I can't, because I have an errand to run, so maybe some other time. - Hi. - Oh. Hi. What are the chances? Twice in 2 days. Well,not so strange for me. I come every day. Can I ask you a question? Does the name adam godfrey mean anything to you? No. Should it? I just thought maybe he was one of your husband's friends. Steve had so many friends. How would I know him? Um,he was a writer. He's passed away now. Adam godfrey. I'm sorry. I don't remember him. If I do, I'll let you know. Can I ask you how your husband died? Yeah. I thought I told you. A bolt of lightning. What? I know it sounds crazy, but that's how he died. He was struck by lightning. - Lightning? - That's what she said, but my ghost said that he died, and then there was a big flash of light. And so? So,what if they both died from some sort of electrical shock? Is it possible that they're psychically connected in some way, or that their souls have swapped bodies? You know,I never thought I'd hear myself say this,but that's crazy. Right. It is.I'm listening to myself say it,and it sounds crazy. Then again,why not? It's almost halloween. It's true.My grandmother always saidthat the veil between the living and the dead got thinner around halloween. The only way to prove something like that... would be if you found where the other body was,right? Yes,and then I could talk to the ghost. But I have searched the internet, and I can't find anything on adam godfrey's death. I even checked with his publishers. Oh,yeah? What did they say? Clueless. They didn't even know he was dead. Wait a minute. You didn't tell them,did you? How I can I? I can't prove it. Tricky. Now,steve burris,on the other hand, I did find something on him. His obituary. And he is nothing like adam at all. Listen to this.A staple on the social circuit with a taste forluxury,adventure,and the good life. And your guy was a hermit,huh? It's not as if their paths were to cross very often. Coming. Hey,jim. I hope it's not too late for visitors. Not at all. Hey,delia, come on in. Oh,I'd love to,but I really just wanted to drop this book by on my way home. It's a little dark, but guess I like that kind of thing. Me,too. Thanks. You sure you don't want to stay? We're about to dig into dessert. Dessert? I'd die for something chocolate. Oh,dear. It sounds great,but I really should get home. Ned accidentally agreed to let me watch a movie that has no murder, mayhem,or violent explosions in it, so I'd like to watch as much of it as I can before he realizes his mistake. Boring. Ok,then. We'll see you tomorrow. Ok. - Hey! - Are you ok? Yeah. Gosh,I'm such a klutz today. Bye. Can't I just see what's for dessert? It's not like I'm worried about trans fats anymore. Wait a minute. Was she accompanied? Yep. And her ghost is a chocoholic. I really don't know what I'm going to do about that. I knew it. Hey,listen to this dediation-- "to jean,withoutwhose loving support this book could not have been written." Sounds like a wife to me. You know,he told me that he was alone-- always alone. Maybe she abandoned him. You're a hopeless romantic,you know that? Ok. There is a jean godfrey who owns jean's pet shop in sunset park. What do you think-- man or a woman? Only one way to find out. You know what? It's fun to brainstorm this stuff with you. You know, I read somewhere-- ghostbusting keeps a marriage strong. Oh,I can't! No,I can'T. Honey, are you all right? Oh,yeah. I'm sorry. I just promised my husband that I wouldn't come home with something soft and fluffy and--oh. Oh,yeah. Well,the reptile section's right over there,if that's any help. Actually,I am looking for a human being. Jean godfrey? You're looking at her. Oh,oh,hi. I'm melinda gordon? Are you related to the writer adam godfrey? Well,if being married to him counts as related-- - he's your husband? - Was,long time ago. I kept the name,though. So why do you ask? I'm so sorry. He's dead. Oh,ok. Tony,could you take the counter,please? Sure ********** Let's talk outside. Sorry,but I really have to do this. I'm not going to light it, I just go through the motions. Quitting's a bitch. That's what I hear. So adam's dead. How'd it happen. There was an accident. I don't have all the details. You the girlfriend? No. I just met him recently. He told me that he'd always been alone. Well,I guess he kind of was,actually, even when we were married. Yeah. It was really good at first. It was just-- he was kind of a hard guy to get close to. So I assume you've read lost delusions. It was pretty much the story of his life. Tourtured young guy too smart for his own good,doesn't really fit in. I guess I thought that I was going to be the one to bring him in from the cold. You know what?Don't ever think that you can save those tortured young artists. I think that they actually like being tortured. It's what makes them artists. He was successful for a while,though,right? Oh,yeah. When lost delusions came out,it was a big deal. And then his second novel came out. Critics had a feeding frenzy. Adam was devastated and he said he needed to move to the cabin to have some isolation to write. At first,he came home every weekend, then once a month,and then there was the talk. The one where you know it's all over. If you want someone reliable, you get yourself a pet. Thanks for the advice. Yeah. Thank you for letting me know about this. Oh,man. This is going to be really hard for kate to hear. - Kate? - His daughter. Yeah. Death can be hard to explain to children. Well,she's hardly a child. She's a junior at state U. She hasn't seen or heard from her father since she was 3. - 3? - She'd never admit it, but I think that she always thought that she'd see him again. Hell,maybe even get an explanation. Well,that's not going to happen now,is it? Well,thanks. I just-- I wanted to let you know. - What are you doing here? - I'm not sure. I feel like I'm near something that used to be important. I need to talk to you. Why didn't you tell me that you had a wife and daughter? A wife and daughter? No,I didn't have a wife and... oh,my god. Jean and kate. Yeah,jean and kate, who you abandoned when she was 3. - Why would I do that? - That's what I'd like to know. All I know is I had a lot of demons. It was hard being around people. I think I felt that I wasn't good for either of them. So you ditched them? No,I freed them to lead happier lives without me. lives without me. - What? - That's classic. - You don't understand-- - no,you don't understand. How do you think your daughter felt when she had to watch you walk out of her life forever? Free? You're her father. It was complicated. I'm not proud of it-- good,'cause you don't deserve to be happy. You deserve to be exactly where you are-- in the wrong grave, doomed to listen to a woman grieve a good man,knowing that he isn't you. So anyway,I'm standing in this alley, and I'm yelling at this ghost. Why did I let myself get so emotional? Not gonna read it,huh? I don't want anything to do with this ghost. Why would I help someone who would run out on his family,abandoning his child? Whose family are we talking about now? Ok,I admit it,I have a personal thing going on here. So what? So nothing. Just know where it's coming from. And then he had the nerve to expect me to make it right for him. In his defense,there aren't too many other people he could go to. You're defending him? I'm pointing out you're a little emotional right now. I don't have to help every ghost that comes along. It's my call,right? I mean,you've heard me tell ghosts to leave me alone. Only when you thought you couldn't help them. You really think I can help this one? Yeah,I do. And I think you do,too. I can't talk about this right now. I have a headache. Ooh,that's fabulous. Is it for sale? Oh,no,I'm sorry. It's mine. Lucy and ethel would die for that bag. May I? Oh,sure. There you go. Careful with that clasp, liberace. You trying to break it? Ow. There must be a pin sticking out of it somewhere. I don't see it. Ok. Thank you so much, and please come back again soon. I will. You girls have great taste. That really is a nice bag. I haven't noticed it before. Yeah. I got it a couple of days ago at an estate sale. Ah. That explains a lot. You know,there are some figurines in the back. Could you go and get them for me? You might have to dig around a little bit. Sure,no problem. So it's the bag. Of course it's the bag. I don't even know that woman. - What's your name? - Marilyn mandeville. Why are you the only one who can see me? It's a long story. So how did you die,marilyn? I was at a charity event, one of those horrible things where no one can remember the charity, but they all sure as hell know where the photographers are. Well,I wasn't in the mood to be in the papers. I knew I looked all red and blotchy from crying over luca. - Luca? - My boyfriend. Hot-headed, bad-tempered, just this much dangerous. All the things I love in a man. Anyway,a friend told me that she saw him out with another woman, so... I kicked him out of the house. Aha. React first, ask questions later. But I loved him. Anyway,I was just about to leave the party, when suddenly I saw him across the room. He saw me,too. He wrote something downon a napkin. He gave it to a waiter to give to me. I tell you,my heart was pounding so hard, I thought everybody could hear it. Well,what did it say? I didn't want to look desperate to read it. So I tucked it in my bag. I finished my drink and then I practically knocked over tables and chairs to get outside to read it. But then-- you died. Heart attack. I never got to read the note. Marilyn,I hate to tell you this, but the chances of that note still being in the bag-- please,will you just check? Melinda? God! The interruptions in this place. Shelby. Hi. I just had to come by because the strangest thing happened to me. You asked me if I knew a man named adam godfrey,right? Right. - Well,he just called me. - What? I was just about to have dinner when the phone rang. I said hello,but all I heard was silence and a click. I looked down at the caller I.D. And it said adam godfrey. But didn't you say that adam godfrey died? Yes,I did. That's what I thought, so I wrote the number down. Melinda, you may find this hard to believe, but I think your friend is trying to reach you from the afterlife. I didn't think you'd come back. I didn't plan to. Well,I'm glad you did. I have one question and I want you to be really honest. How do you walk away from your family? You tell yourself your daughter will never feel the loss. She won't miss you because she never knew you. Your wife will find love somewhere else and be better off. You tell yourself that your work will be the thing that lives on after you,and that's what's important. Well,maybe you needed to learn this,adam. That guy whose grave I'm in... he was really loved. He must have been a good man. Shelby thought so. Shelby? The woman who's been crying at his grave, the one you called to reach me. - I--I didn't call that woman. - You didn't? Who knew I could even use a phone? I'm dead. Does this number look familiar to you? That's my phone number at the cabin. Do you remember where this is? I think so. Why? Because somebody's in this cabin and I think we should find out who it is. Does this road look familiar to you? No. Wait a minute... yes. I was here. It was late at night and my car had broken down. No,wait a minute, I was out of gas. The guy who picked me up, he seemed upset about something. And I asked him about it, but he wouldn't talk,not until he heard my name. Turns out that he had read lost delusions 4 times, and so he wanted to know all about me. I told him I lived in a cabin miles away from everything. But I asked him about himself and he got tense. "You wouldn't want my life," he said. He didn't really know his way around, so we stopped at a bar. I remember the bartender said there was a gas station 3 miles down the road, but my new friend said that he wanted a drink,and so did I. He said he was a businessman who--who had the golden touch, at least until lately, and now things were going sour, he couldn't catch a break. And he got some inside information about something,like a big merger. Gambled everything he had left on it,and it tanked. Now I remember. He said that his wife didn't know anything about this. I can't tell her... and he said he couldn't stand to see her have to give up the life that they had. All that he had left was this insurance policy. I'm worth more dead than alive. This guy,he was so in love with his wife, and I just felt empty. I never loved anyone like that. Did he tell you his name? Well,if he did, I don't remember. Do you think he killed himself? Looked like he was heading that way. It was starting to rain, so I decided to cut my losses and walk. Help! Help me! Help! What are you doing? And that's how he became you. That man,he was the name on my tombstone. And I'm guessing he's in your cabin. But why would he do that? Why would he throw away everything he had,the woman that he loved? Why not? It's what you did,wasn't it? - This is it? - This is it. - Yes? - Who are you? - Who are you? - I'm kate godfrey. Who are you? My daughter. You're adam's daughter. Put it this way-- he's half the reason I was born. Second time,who are you? Sorry. Melinda gorden. I live in grandview,and I know your father. You're the one that told my mother he was dead. Yes. Well,that was helpful of you, considering it's not true. What does that mean? Oh,I'm sorry, can I come in? It's not my place. So...what makes you think that he's not dead? No accident report, no body,no obituary. Do you want me to go on? No,I'd look for them,too. So not finding them it makes sense you think he's dead. I know he is. Look,I know that this is gonna sound hard to believe-- I'm sure it will. I've spoken to your father's spirit. Oh,wow, you're one of those. Please believe me. It's true. I know my father attracted some eccentric fans, but this takes it to a whole new level. Do you know much about your father? - No. I've never even read his books. - Why not? It was the great god of literature that made him leave us. Frankly,I'm not interested. Kate,your father gave me every detail about what happened to him the night that he died. I'd be happy to tell you if you like. Do you know what I'd like? Is for you to leave me alone. My mother tells me she hears from you that he's dead. She asks me to come here and gather his effects, I come out here and what do I find? A full fridge. Cigarettes in the ash tray. Newly opened mail. Dead,my ass. I just hope I can get out of here before he comes back. Kate...the man who's been living here, his name is steve burris. There was a mix-up the night the night that your father died and he was mistaken for him, but your father is here now. And he really wants to talk to you if he can just make some peace. Are you aware that you aren't even remotely believable? Adam,please tell me something that kate will understand. Help me. Just that she was such a beautiful child. He thought you were so beautiful. That's it? Oh,come on. Didn't you do your research? The name of my fuzzy bunny, my favorite pet. What about a cute nickname? Come on. Make me weep. I--I can'T. He told me before that the only reason he left was to free you from having him as your father. He didn't feel like he could give you what you needed, and that you would have a better life without him. Damn straight I did. Look,I know how you feel. He did a terrible thing, and you've thought about him every day of your life with anger and resentment,I know. - You know? - Yes,I do know, but,kate,for one minute,just--just imagine that what I'm saying to you is true. That he's here and that he loves you and he feels really bad about not being in your life. If you could tell him one more thing,what would it be? I'd tell him to go to hell. I'm so sorry. Don't be. She's right. She did the only thing she could do-- she hardened her heart to me, she got on with her life. There's no reason she should forgive me. No reason at all. Wow,you should have seen her. She was so bitter,so hard. Is that what I'm like when I talk about my father? Listen,everybody's gotta put the hard shell on,you know? That means yes. No,that means no. You know,I can feel the hurt. Look,the good news is, you overcame the hurt. Helped somebody else and maybe,in the process, you helped yourself. You always know the right thing to say. I used to always know the right thing to say. Yesterday you wanted to bite my head off. Oh...you were saying the right thing yesterday, I just didn't know it. I can't sleep. I'm steve burris. Are you gonna make trouble for me? I need to know. You heard me talking to kate. I was on my way back from the mailbox when she drove up. I stayed by the side of the house waiting for her to leave,and then you came. That stuff you told her, how'd you know all that? Adam told me. Right. I heard that whole bit about how you talk to the dead. Come on,tell me the truth. How'd you really know? I wasn't lying.Adam told me about the night that he ran out of gas. How you picked up, you told him about your money troubles, and you told him that you would be worth more dead than alive. No one knew that. He said he was killed in the storm, and that you stole his wallet so that you could fake your death. Now he's in your grave. I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do. I was on the verge of suicide,and... when this happened, it seemed the only answer. You found him. He found me. Adam's here now. Please... if he's really here, make him understand I was desperate. Tell him I know,I've been there, but this isn't the way to go. He says he understands, but this isn't the answer. You can't just leave him in the wrong grave. He has to hear shelby crying everyday. Shelby cries? For me? Tell him he's lucky. I threw away the people who love me. Adam only wishes he could have had what you have. But he told me . he needed to be free. I understood that. That's what I wanted,too! No,it's not freedom, I was wrong. He was wrong. He doesn't feel free. He feels... very,very,sad. And he wants you tell shelby that you're alive. I can'T. She'll-- she'll never forgive me. You gotta risk it. Look at all the other risks you took. He says you have to risk it. And tell him I forgive him for the rest. And he forgives you for the rest of it. He does? He does. Steve... she will,too. You should feel good about what you said to him. Even if nothing comes of it, you're a good man. That's nice of you to say, even if we both know it isn't true. Melinda? Hi,I got your message. Um...yes,there's something that I have to tell you. Ok,the night that steve died, you said that he was alone, and that's not really true.It isn't? How do you know? My friend,the one that I was telling you about,adam godfrey, he was with him that night. He was? But you said he's dead. He is. He died that night. But they only found one body. I know. And it wasn't steve'S. It was adam'S. Melinda,what are you trying to tell me? What I'm trying to tell you is... what I'm trying to tell you is to look over there. Oh,my god! Oh,my god! Steve! You're alive! Oh,shelby, I missed you so much. How is this possible? What happened? Oh,my god,I'm seeing your face again! I love you so much! Shelby,I have a lot to tell you. I've done something you're not gonna like, it's something bad. There's gonna be lawsuits and trouble-- I don't care, I don't care! As long as you're alive! Thank you. In my version,he'd probably drop dead of a heart attack as soon as they left the cemetery. I don't think so, I read your book. You did? I did. Last night, it was beautiful. And I can understand why the writer would need to live alone. I'm not sure I understand. You need to forgive yourself a little. She'll never come, will she? My daughter. She'll never visit her father's grave. - You never know. - Yes,I do. This is one story that won't have a happy ending. Look,adam, I'm not your daughter... but I guess you've noticed that I have some issues of my own. But you know what? If I wasas your daughter,I would... I would find it in my heart to forgive you. Why? Maybe it's because I read your book. Or maybe it's because I realize that everybody has their own story. And you just don't know it. So how's your story going to end? Happy. It's all you can ask for, right,is a happy ending. No... don't tell me it-- really exists. It does. Well,I'll be damned. Actually, that's not the idea. But...why do i get to see it? I mean,I pretty much failed on every level of my life. Because you found some peace. At least a little bit. Am I wrong? No. You're not wrong. Thank you. You're very welcome. Damn! What happened? I tripped over this bag again and I twisted my ankle. Stuff like that has been happening to me for the past 3 days. Well,maybe it's the curse of that pirate outfit you're wearing. Look,I am going to a great halloween party. Do you want to come? Ugh,no. I'm gonna go home, take a hot bath, and think about anything but ghosts. You know,I don't get you. Ghosts and spooks are fun. Yeah. Will you do me a favor? Sell this bag. Ever since I got it,I have had the worst luck. I thought you didn't believe in anything like that. Yeah,well,I don'T. Just shows you how desperate I am. I will be happy to sell it for you. Hey,delia,tomorrow why don't we close up and go to lunch together? - Sounds good. - Happy halloween. About time.I thought I'd never get rid of that girl.Now,look inside. - I don't see a note. - Check the lining. Nothing. There's a little rip in the lining. You have to feel around. All right! I found it! Oh,I'm so sorry,marilyn. I don't you're gonna like what this has to say. What? What does it say? "Rip my heart out, why don't you." He still loved me. Luca still loved me! It's what we said to each other after every break-up when we got back together. "Rip my heart out, why don't you." It meant everything was going to be ok now. Oh...I get it. Oh,I really have to find him now. Oh,let me stop you right there--you don't want to do that. Do you see a light? Yes. Yeah,well then, you should go into it and wait for him. That could take a long time. It won't seem that long. Trust me. Go. Wait for him to rip your heart out. Sorry! I ran out of candy a couple of hours ago. Bye. 5 signs death
