And gus and riley, and i promised Their moms i would feed them, too. Cool. no problem. Ah, you're the best. Oh, wait. never mind. what? I'm not the best anymore? no, no, no, no.

Uh, ok. well, i have to pick up my kid from soccer, so... You know, i need you to help me. I've been in there for 2 days, And none of the workers have noticed me. Your body? In that building over there, facedown in the dirt. I don't want my loved ones to see me like that. please. Don't let me rot. [sighs] let me call my husband. Ok. come on. come on. come on. come on. come on. Hey... Go. go. see? it's down there. Go! go! go! go! go! come on. [gasps] ohh. Yeah, i-i'm down there. All i'm asking for is my dignity. [water dripping] A little further in. [beep] Do you mind, uh, calling the police? Watch the quarter. Well, how can we watch it if you're hiding it? You can't, because it's disappeared. How'd you do that?! that was so cool. It's magic. Real magic? A magician never tells. Hey, gus, i wanna go play at your house. I thought you were coming to my house. I wanna see some more magic. I can do stuff, too, things you can't. Yeah, right. do another one. Hey, uh, guys, sorry i'm late. What's goin' on? Gus is magic. Not real magic. Uh, let's talk about it in the car, huh? Go buckle up. doors are open. How you doin'? What's goin' on? I wanna go home. All right. [siren] Don't forget to have the coroner sign the report, ok? Eli: oh, detective blair, hi. And how'd you find this one? Oh, it's, uh, simple, really. Um... Yeah. yeah, because, uh, he--he... Dropped his cellphone, And then he went to go and retrieve it. And i saw shoes. Uh-huh. Why is it everywhere you go, You seem to keep finding bodies? Because people keep dying. Do--do you know who he is? Uh, his i.d. was in his wallet. Name's kirk jansen. His wife is on her way now. Now it gets interesting. What does that mean? Means we called her. Woman: where is he? Where's my husband? Oh, my god. Kirk, no! Wow. she's really convincing. Don't go anywhere, either of you. I'll take it from here. oh, my god! kirk! No! no! No! Look, i know how hard it is to watch Someone you love grieve like this. You know, we can help you talk to her If you want before you go into the light. Oh, uh-uh. no, no, no. i'm not going anywhere. Well, you need to let go and let your wife mourn you. Rita, mourn? Don't count on it. those tears are an act. That bitch killed me. Child, whispering: can you see us? Sync by honeybunny Ready? [resumes humming] nuh! [gasps] where is it? Mm. Ta-da! Cool. can i do it? Yeah, but you're gonna have to practice a lot, ok? Uh-huh! There's more where that came from. Thanks, daddy. You're welcome. See ya. this is awesome! Since when is he into magic? Oh, ever since little gus started showing him some tricks. I've never seen him look so left out. That nearly killed me. Aww. well, you know what? It's good for him to have a hobby besides ghosts. Especially since he's started telling his friends That he can do things, Um, other people can't. Wait. did he tell them about the ghosts? No. no, i stopped him before he could finish, And then i took him out to buy this magic kit to distract him. Genius. thank you. Oh. hey, your body came into the morgue today. They're gonna try to get to it tonight for the autopsy. Please stop calling it "my body." Look, do you really think his wife murdered him? That's what he said. And if he's telling the truth, I'm never gonna get him into the light. It's hard to say, "i forgive you," After your spouse whacks you. Yeah. should you leave this one to the police? I always do. But i have to get him into the light. All right. Let's say she really is guilty. But what if the police can't solve the crime And you are the only one who knows the truth? Scrub brush. Thank you. Yeah, of course i know rita and kirk jansen. They're like the power couple of grandview real estate. They're married. they're successful. They're witty. they're charming. They get all the best listings. Sound like you're the president of their fan club. Oh, are you kidding me? I pretty much hate them. Kirk beat me out for the golden key 2 years ago. Golden key? yeah. It's a sales award from the realty association, And he doubled his listings after that. And you wanna know why? because... He's a genius. Listen to this. "the kitchen will make you want to kick off your shoes, "pour a glass of ice cold prosecco "from the stainless steel fridge while sinatra croons On the room-to-room digital sound system." I mean, it's poetry. Ok. so then if they were such a perfect couple, Then how come he said that she wanted to murder him? I mean, something obviously went sour at some point. Wait. didn't we have a rule Where we let the police figure out who-dunnits when they can? Yeah, but if we're gonna cross this ghost over, We need to figure out the why-dunnit, For lack of a better word. Give me a shout when you do. So you said that your wife wanted to murder you, And now you don't know why? He's here. Oh. um... Hi, kirk. I'm really sorry about... You know. yeah. It's simple. she hated me. Lots of married couples hate each other. How'd she do it, anyway? Ah, you don't wanna know. Uh, if we're gonna help you, we have to know. Well, trust me. it was horrible. All i can say is everything about rita is toxic. I wouldn't put it past her If she poisoned me. I--you know, i would have walked barefoot Over burning, broken glass for her. I did everything i could To make her happy. Obviously not happy enough. Who's there? Kirk? [gasping] That's how she killed me. Since you asked. Anaphylactic shock. He died from allergies? It can happen. I mean, the symptoms you described Sounded like a severe reaction. Ok, was it from something he touched, inhaled, or ate? I don't know. we'll have to wait For the tox screen to come back, but, uh, The police think he was poisoned. Yeah, so does the ghost. I mean, could his wife have deliberately Exposed him to something that he was allergic to? Absolutely, but did she drag him Down to that basement by herself? Actually, i overheard the police saying That he crawled in there on his own. In a $2,000 suit? He was a realtor, you know. Maybe the building was one of his listings, Or maybe he was there doing some sort of inspection. Whatever it is, he's not coughing it up. So to speak. [p.a.] dr. travis, you have a visitor in the main lobby. Eli? No, delia. i wanna see If she can get me the skinny on that building. bye. Bye. Watch the magic ball. Gus: i think i've seen this one. Well, it's a lovely classic brownstone, And it was sold twice within the past few months. So somebody flipped it? Well, if they did, they weren't very smart, Because they took a huge loss. Well, did either represent the buyer or seller? Mm-mmm. both transactions were private. It was sold by some company named brokerage investments, And before that, it was purchased by arcmod limited. I wonder if rita or kirk have anything to do with those companies. Well, according to the chain of title, they didn't, But, you know, it's not really hard to hide those kind of things. Abracadabra. [snaps photo] There's an open house tomorrow, A big property that rita's listing. I'm sure people from her work are gonna be there. I could go, ask some questions, [snaps photo] see what they know. Oh. gus: let me guess. the ball's disappeared, And now it's in your pocket. That one's easy. You know, it still just doesn't explain What kirk was doing crawling around in that basement. That building wasn't even for sale, So he wouldn't have had any interest in it. Hey, check this out. Cool. Bet you can't do this. Abracadabra. Do that again. Wow. he is good. Really good. Gus: how'd you do that? A magician never tells. Remember? Well, that's weird. Magic is weird. No, no, no. not that. My camera. how did these photographs get here? Because you just took them. No. sorry. i--i just saw rita kissing another guy. Oh, a guy that wasn't kirk? Yeah. um, i guess there's a lot more to the story Than the ghost is letting on. I guess. Oh, yeah. you bet there is. Rita was cheating on you? She's also plotting with that hottie on how they can Get their hands on my $2 million life insurance policy. That's why she killed me. You cannot let her get away with this. Oh. thank you. Mmm. hey... Who was that guy in the photo? You know, the one's kirk's wife's Gonna be spending all her insurance money on. I have no idea. The pictures that i saw vanished. Otherwise, delia would have known. They all know each other. Maybe mr. hottie runs in that circle. I'm sorry. uh... Mr. hottie? Heh. i only call him that Because he has a certain appeal. Wow. that's how it goes, huh? all right. Yeah, i guess you couldn't ask his wife, uh, "who's this guy you're makin' out with?" right? Uh, no, not this time. No. melinda, i don't think this is The kind of woman you're gonna wanna back into a corner. If she did it, which i don't know if she did. Really? why? well, first of all, Kirk isn't really sure how he died. Wait. his bout with anaphylactic shock's not specific enough? If that's what killed him. Oh, no, i checked my e-mail. It did. i'm sure of it. They haven't exactly found the allergen yet, But they're gonna find out. Ok, so then what? Well, the police'll check his medical history, right, And then they'll go and see if she knew about the allergy And then purposely exposed him to the substance. You know, i have to admit it. Maybe he didn't know how she did it, But why is he so sure that she did? 'cause of the affair. Which he didn't tell me about, Which is weird, because i think he knew. Hmm. wait. don't you get all your visions through him? Not necessarily. Sometimes i can see things that ghosts don't intend, But he wasn't surprised by the photos. He was just angry and smug, like he was kind of happy That all the details were coming out. Yeah, the details that'll nail her, right? justice. Yeah, or revenge. Is this aiden's? Yeah, it is. This is part of his magic kit. This is his on-the-go, Traveling bag of tricks. You know, he--he was doing a trick today Where he moved the ball from one hand to the other, And you were helping him with that, right? Did you-- did you teach him that? No. Well, then where did he learn it? Ah, maybe his friends or tv or... The book has illustrations. You think he got some ghostly help? It's possible. Ah, speaking of help, hold on. No, no, no. it's fine. relax. [gasps] oh, my god. Oh, my god. Honey, what is it? eww. Wh-what-- there were these-- I sw--i swear i... I know. i know. Delia: intestines? What the hell do those mean? That he hates her guts. funny. I don't understand. i mean, usually when i get a vision, It's something that the ghost wants me to feel. Yeah, or torture you with. Well, there's always that. but you know what? I have done everything that this ghost asked me. I mean, i've even been helping with the police. How are you doing that? through jim. You know, i don't think the coroner would have even thought To look for allergens if jim hadn't mentioned it. Ok, about that, didn't you say That kirk died from some exposure to mold? Yeah. they just found out he's allergic to a certain strain. Ok, well, that's interesting, Because this building had mold. it's in the report. You know the inspections that you get Every time that you're gonna buy a house? mm-hmm. Well, nowadays almost everybody has these inspections done, Since an entire industry kind of sprung up Convincing people that it could kill you. Uh, in this case, it did. Well, usually it's harmless, But not something that people wanna deal with. Maybe that's why the building flipped ownership so fast. There's lots of different kinds of molds. What are you lookin' for? Well, here it is. "aflatoxin." Jim called earlier. This is what killed kirk. Who would have gotten this? Um, the realtors who handled the sale, The owner, and the buyer, Would rita have seen it? I mean, it's possible. it's just something That the seller has to disclose to the buyer, but she was neither. So that would mean she would have to know Exactly what he was allergic to And then scour every building listing looking for a building With that exact kind of mold. Come on. that's a little nutty. Or genius. It's the perfect crime. She let me right into a trap. How did she do that? I was supposed to meet her there that day. Under the building? Well, maybe she, uh-- I don't know-- moved my--moved my body. The police said that your body was never moved. Did you tell them everything that you know? Did you tell them everything that i told you? Uh, more than i'm comfortable with. Look, i know that you're angry with her, But this is your wife we're talking about. Why would she do this to you? Why are you asking me all these questions? Probably because you never answer any. And what was with the entrails? What? wh-what are you talking about? what-- How'd you find out about that? Oh, you didn't mean for me to see them? I thought all you cared about was bringing me peace. [bell rings] Rita jansen was taken in by the police. Right. you see? she did it. i was right. Oh. hey, kirk. Was she placed under arrest? No. officially she's a person of interest. The cops are all over her. They found some incriminating photographs. I was just with detective blair. i saw them. They were taken by a private investigator. See? i knew she was lying about something, And when i saw those photos-- Establishes motive. they just have to prove means. You have to show them the mold report. She had to know about that. She had to-- you don't know that. You know what i know? I know that rita's gonna hate jail, And for the first time since my trachea shut And my tongue got as big as your shoe, I'm feeling a little peace. Police are questioning rita now. you can't just barge in there. I'm not. what's the name of the detective who took those photos? Nick. nick sexton. delia's gonna call you With the address. what's the rush? I just need to find out what was going on in that marriage Before rita says anything to incriminate herself. It's a little too late for that. Here. This is what you saw, right? Yeah. that's it. Well, the cops saw it, too. When they get ahold of that mold report, It's not gonna look good for her. Wait. what's this? I didn't see this picture. That's the brownstone where kirk died. The ghost said she lured him there. Could this be what he meant? Maybe the p.i. wasn't the only one following rita. Maybe kirk was going to confront her. In a crawl space? You really won't let go of that crawl space, will you? It's the only thing he can't explain away. What do you mean? His story keeps changing every time we find something new. Well, if she didn't do it, who did? Mold spores, as far as i know. At first, it was all, "i'm sad, and i'm lost, And i can't believe she'd try to kill me," And then the next thing, he was admitting that she had cheated. Guess it's all just a part of his motive. Because he hated her. I'm just not sure how much. Maybe enough to frame her. How are you gonna undo that? I don't know. And i started doing magic when i was 9. I thought that was young. How long have you been practicing? Aiden: few days. You've already outgrown your magic kit? I think it's 'cause his friends have seen all his tricks, And he's just looking for new ones. Like these. Wait. you've mastered every one of those tricks? You wanna see a mind-reading trick? Ok, kid. sure. Turn around and write down any word you want. All right. All right. i'm ready. Turtle. That's awesome. Wait a minute. buddy, how did--how did you just do that? Are there some mirrors back there? Wait. did you guys just exchange a magician's code word? No. really. Can i look at some more stuff? Yeah. yeah. go ahead. That's incredible. Yeah, it is incredible, Especially since he can't even read yet. Yeah, we have all the listings you asked for. Hi. ok, sure, we'll get right on it. Thank you, bye. Rita. Hello, delia. Wh-what's goin' on? what are you doing here? Well, i hear you've been asking around about some of my listings. You did? Sidling up to every agent in my office. The faylans' open house. Just so you know, i'm still in the game. I haven't missed a single showing since the day kirk died. You think i'm poaching your listings? I'm a highly functioning person. I'm hardly undone by my husband's death. Oh, and don't be going after his listings either. His clients know me, and they trust me. Would you, uh, mind going and finding The, uh, parkside paperwork? mm-hmm. Yeah, and just, um-- Just take your time till you find it. Rita, i swear to you i am not trying to get your business Or kirk's. i was... I was asking about you because i was concerned And, ok, because i'm nosy. Well, that, i buy. Why don't you come and sit down? You look like you've had a bad day. You have no idea. They think i did it. Who? the police? And it is so unfair. I know, honey. it must be awful. Because now i'm gonna have to wait so long and act all broken up Before i get on with my life, Assuming i'm not serving a life sentence, i mean. I--i just don't want people to think i'm cold. I know. we seemed like the perfect couple. We did, didn't we? Yes. of course. Perfect. But we weren't. You're a widow, right? Um, yes. mm-hmm. Well, how long did you wait? I mean, how long were you off the market Before you started dating again? A long time. Was it difficult Finding someone you clicked with, who was your equal? Yes. I'm gonna give you some free advice. Date anyone. Just have fun. Only, don't get caught up in something that could-- That could destroy you. Passion, it's not all it's cracked up to be. I didn't work for kirk for long, Just a couple of weeks, Usually as an independent contractor-- Or private investigator, as you say. But don't worry. no offense. What a relief. Uh, normally i don't share the details Of my employment with anyone. Well, you talked to the police. thank you. Well, so it's, uh, public record. I guess. You said you were a friend of rita's? I'm just trying to find out What went on between her and her husband. Well, maybe it's better you don't know. It's not gonna help her case. Because she was seeing another man? No, because she hated her husband. The other man thing, those things happen. Look, what i'm trying to say is it's one thing to have an affair. It's another to throw it in your husband's face. So if kirk knew, then why did he hire you? Well, he wasn't sure at first, But she got onto me pretty quick. Look. let me show you. Heh heh. yeah. Yeah, let me show you the whole picture. Is that rita flipping you the-- And then some. Yeah, she knew i was working for kirk, But she just kept on seein' that guy. So why didn't she leave him? Why didn't he leave her? Look, by the time i met him, he was sick of her, too. But they had a business together, reputations to keep. Neither one wanted to be perceived as the bad guy, But really, nobody wanted to lose. Lose what? This weird game that they had started Of hurtin' each other. it was like a competition. The stuff that they came up with was very inventive, But sickening, Disgusting. Did any of their games involve intestines? Oh, you heard about that? Oh ho! that was vintage kirk He put entrails into a refrigerator at one of her open houses. Yeah, i bet she didn't sell any condos that day. Heh heh heh heh. But i bet she didn't tell you how it came on, though, Her little stroke of genius, The shrimp incident. The shrimp incident? Yeah. yeah, kirk had this huge property, All right? a--a total mcmansion. So she sneaks in and sews raw shrimp into the custom drapes. Ohh... Man, it took days to find the smell. By then, the stench was so bad, The owners just took it off the market. Do you think that she could have actually killed him? To be honest, he could have just as easily have killed her. Look, this thing wasn't gonna end Until they both woke up and realized That they had married the perfect-- And i mean perfect-- person for each other Or one of 'em ended up dead. And maybe not even then. Yeah, it was hell. the police kept at me for hours. My lawyer kept telling me to shut up. No, i don't know when i'm gonna be back in the office, But the party line is that i am on top of all my listings, Even if i'm in jail. No, i'm not joking. it's entirely possible. Listen, i'm exhausted, And i might get arrested tomorrow. I've gotta go. [sighing] [moaning] Aah! [winces] [gasping] Hi, rita. melinda. So nice to meet you. Thanks for coming by. Well, anything for a friend of delia's. This is a lovely home. Great curb appeal. We're not gonna have any problem selling it. Great. Come on in. Thank you. Um, i hope you don't mind me asking, But are you ok? Oh, for someone who's been in a thousand homes, You'd think i'd know my own well enough Not to trip over my bathroom scale. Is that really all that happened? Did i mention i fell into my mirror? Look, i'm gonna be honest with you. I'm not selling my house. I wanted to talk to you because i think that you need my help. With what? Whatever hurt you last night Is the same thing that got you in trouble with the police, And i believe it's your husband kirk. Kirk? i'm--my lawyer doesn't want me discussing that. That's because he's trying to keep you out of jail, But jail is gonna be the least of your problems If we don't fix things with your husband. Oh, my husband is dead. But he's not gone. I beg your pardon? I have a gift. I see spirits. They have unfinished business, And i've talked to your husband. Really? I know that it's hard to believe, but trust me. This is just the beginning, Because he thinks that you murdered him, And he is gonna continue to punish you Until we can find a way to make peace for the two of you. I-is he here right now? No, but he's never very far, so we don't have a lot of time. Heh. i should have known The minute i saw those shrimp. Ok, well, maybe if you could just tell me what went wrong-- Are you gonna see kirk anytime soon? Great, because i'd like you to give him this message for me. Please tell that fluffed-up money-pit hole in the ground I hope he burns in hell. Oh, that probably isn't the best idea. Uh, kirk, you wanna haunt me that bad, bring it on. Uh, also probably not the wisest choice. Wait. you really wanna know what went wrong with us? Kirk cheated in his career, And he cheated in our marriage. He had p.i.s following me around, Taking my picture all over town, But he was the one who stepping out. Bet he didn't bother to tell you that, did he? [door closes] It's like i was a part of a reality show. I mean, why else would anyone talk about their husband that way? ooh. And her dead husband, no less. Ok, i hate to say it, but it looks Like they've picked up the fight Just where they left it off. I mean, if that p.i.'s tellin' the truth. I think he was, At least, if you go by what they're saying On the caravans and at the open houses And what rita told me. It turns out there was trouble in camelot long before kirk died. Did anything happen to trigger the change? The golden key happened. What, that goofy sales award? I mean that really cool sales award. No, he's right. it is goofy. I mean, it's not even an award for merit or skill or character. No, it's just the person who has The highest sales, right? Yeah. i mean, i don't even understand Why anybody even cares about it. You know, until i win one. God, i really just wanna take one of those babies home. I guess rita wanted to win one, too. Yeah, and she probably deserved to get one, But he put his name on enough of her listings, And they say that he took credit for a lot of her sales. Why would she let him do that? They were partners, you know? She had her name on some of his listings, But after the golden key, you just started seeing His name on more and more of the deals without hers. You know, i just assumed it was marketing, That they both agreed to it. Ok, she was jealous of his new high profile. But, i mean, i gotta say that's still not a reason to kill somebody. Uh, she said he was cheating In their marriage and in their business. Oh, well. did kirk ever mention anybody else? No. he never stuck around long enough To do anything but throw accusations at her. You know what? i do have those photos that the p.i. took, You know, with the other man. I mean, eli mailed them to me. Yeah, let me look at 'em. Maybe it's somebody in the biz. Do you mean mr. hottie? Oh, my god. Everybody knows this guy. That's javier torres. He's the mortgage officer over at the savings and loan. You can't do a deal without him. And honestly, who would want to? Rumor is, he's quite the ladies man. hmm. This is your monthly payment now, And this is your estimated payment With the new lower rate. God, you make it sound so simple. I am just hopeless with numbers. Oh, i don't believe that. It's lovely for you to say that. Very lovely. What? [stammering] Uh, i was--i was just saying that-- That i don't-- i don't know anything about real estate Except--you know, i hate to gossip about the dead, But you knew kirk, right, And rita? Yeah, it was very sad. And with the police involved now, too... How well did you know them? They brought business to me, Especially rita. Hmm. It wasn't like that. Rita and i only got to know each other well When she came to me to finance her own purchase. What was the purchase? She was buying a brownstone. It was a stretch for her on her own, So i helped her out with the terms. On her own? So her husband wasn't involved in the purchase? That would defeat the purpose. What was the purpose? The building was supposed to be a surprise For him. See, they'd always talked about Starting a bakery together, An escape from the real estate rat race. "supposed to be a surprise." so did he know that? I mean, what happened? I don't know. i just know That she suddenly changed her mind. She came to me, and she begged me to take the place off her hands. I couldn't afford what she paid, So i made a low offer. and she jumped. Look, i felt bad, But she said i saved her life. Why would she sell so fast? I don't know that either. But it turns out she didn't get Such a bad price from me after all, Because right after i took possession, They found toxic mold in the basement. So she didn't know about the mold? If i thought she did, i would have sued her. But the report wasn't released till after the closing. If she didn't know about the mold, then she couldn't have killed him. Excuse me? [gasps] What? my best clothes! Unbelievable. Aah! god. There's more where that came from. You should check every toilet in the house. Sorry. some got stuck. So that woman was right. If you're really here. Mm-hmm. Well, i'm glad. Because there's something i'd like you to see. What? Ah. This is the first house you sold. The new gates community, remember. Oh, but wait. Wasn't i the one that found the buyer Over at cliff daly's open house? And somehow you got all the credit. I don't think this belongs On the leader board, do you? [grunting] Oh, and the east river development. The investor that tipped the scale, Making you the community leader. Sorry. my doing. Not yours. I will not watch you wreck everything i built! This is fun! I'm warning you! Aah! Oh, i'm--i'm sorry. You don't like me smashing All your undeserved, unearned smarmy awards? Ok. I'll just have to smash something else. What--rita. rita. rita. No. rita! don't! [grunting] Rita, don't do it. Rita, stop! Rita! Stop it! No, no, no, no. calm--calm down. calm--calm down. Rita! calm down. don't do it. don't do it! Oh, is that you, dumpling? Oh, god. You're not feeling very happy right now, are you? Then why do i feel so good?! Rita! rita! [grunting] All right, say good-bye to everything you've ever loved! Rita, don't! don't-- don't do it! aah! Thanks for calling. You said there's something you need us to see? [gasps] oh, my god. It's the golden key. can i hold it? Oh, look how it shimmers. you just bask in its glow. [sighs] all right. Deep breath. your day will come. Why did you want us to see this? Read the inscription. "realtor of the year, Kirk jansen and rita jansen." Why is her name on it? Look closer at the engraving. The "rita jansen" is new. You think kirk added her name? I mean, why would he do that? Yeah. what's it doing here? My workmen found it under the crawl space. They dropped a drill bit through this hole, And when they went to look for it, They saw this thing glittering straight underneath us. He must have followed her here. And lost the award Just like the workers lost the drill bit And then went down to get it. And that's when he got too close to the mold. So do you think that this award Was a peace offering from him to her? Yeah, just like this building was supposed to be from her to him. So they were actually trying to make up with each other, And neither of them knows it. [sighs] all right. i'll explain everything to rita. You know, i tried calling her, but she didn't answer. I think you should try and find her. Ok. Let go. Ok. Now i'm fine. Ok. Rita. [gasps] rita, what did you do? Little overkill maybe, but... I made my point. [sighs] is kirk here? I think he went looking for glue. It didn't have to go this way, the destruction-- Oh, yes, it did. He had it coming. You didn't always feel that way. I know about the brownstone that you bought him. Because i'm an idiot. I thought he changed. What do you mean? Kirk's a good-looking guy. He always got lots of attention from women. I mean, i got attention from men, too, But we both knew we used it for business. After the award, he gave me Some speech about leveraging all the attention, Like it was just business, But he loved the glory. He started colisting properties With female agents, attractive ones, So i started pulling listings from him. And that's when the feud started. I canceled one of his open houses. He canceled one of mine. The next thing you knew, I was sewing shrimp into the curtains. I will never touch scampi again. But you knew it had to stop. Which is why i bought the brownstone. It was a peace offering. We'd met in a bakery, And we always talked about having one. And all i got for my efforts Was a fistful of entrails And a p.i. who tracked my every move. Do you know i think he was planning to divorce me? I think you're wrong about that. He had it re-engraved-- oh. Just a few days ago i think he was trying To give it to you before he died. No, no. it's a trick. He was planning to pull the rug out. i'm sure. The first thing i learned in this business Is if someone doesn't trust you, You can't trust them. Do you know how many hours he spent In cars and houses with beautiful, rich women? Of course he didn't want me to be with him. And i did it all for you, you lying, cheating-- Ah-ah-- yeah, it takes one to know one, You--you sad, pathetic, egomaniacal-- W-wait a minute. You're dead. Funny you should notice, considering you killed me. Well, how can i see you? I was trying to find a way to tell you. Uh, you died. You didn't have to. The light table. The metal golf club must have touched a wire. I electrocuted myself. And you didn't realize that he was trying to make it up to you. What? y-you see? I'm--i'm a good guy. And you should have trusted your wife. She didn't kill you. she didn't even know about the mold. Hmm. What are you talking about? [sighs] it was a gift, The bakery that you both had dreamt of. You know, and then she found out that you had somebody following her, And so she got rid of it, you know, out of anger, And that was before she even knew about the mold report. Is that true? You couldn't just trust me? I--i always thought the bakery was a dream, Something that we made up. It was, But isn't everything until you decide to make it real? I feel terrible. That means everything i-- I made up all the-- all the mistrust, the--the... Uh... suspicion. The--the suspicion. i-- I got us both killed. i... I'm sorry, too. But look on the bright side. it's not a teardown. Yeah. We're both still here. Yeah. And you're partners, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, sorry. I still have a bit of a charge. It'll pass. No, not for me. Do you smell that? Fresh baked bread. Heh. There's no way he could have known that the word was "turtle." I mean, obviously i didn't notice anything, but-- You don't seem very surprised. [sighs] why would i be? i did that stuff as a kid. Wait. you conned your friends with ghost magic? Well, not that part, but they did help me with test answers. Ooh, and they would always tell me when a boyfriend was flirting with another girl. That is unfair. you did that? Of course i did. It was the only perk to being a freak... Until my grandmother sat me down and explained that it wasn't right. Hmm. Does that mean it's time for us to sit aiden down? Yeah. poor little guy. Ok. ready? Now take over. Heh heh. Gus is gonna love this. Melinda: aiden. We need to talk. Am i in trouble? A little. What'd i do? Here's the thing. You have a mom Who can do things that other moms can't. And you're a kid Who can do things that other kids can't. But since those things are secret-- So you think if i do tricks, They'll find out our secret? No. No, i just-- I don't think it's fair. I don't understand. Ok, um... Sometimes magic tricks can be like lies. But it's ok for a magician to fool people, Because they know that they're being fooled, right? Mm-hmm. ok, but if you get help, Like from a--a ghost or a shiny. Yeah. then people don't know that stuff's real. So it's like a lie. Yeah. Aiden, who helped you? Was it a ghost or a shiny? It was a ghost. Which one? Different ghosts. There's a lot around. Yeah. I know. Sorry, mom. I promise i'll never do it again. Hey... You're a good boy, aiden, And we trust you. [kiss] you know that, right? Yeah. all right. Let's get ready for bed. Can i play some more? Heh. all right. 5 minutes, and then you get ready for bed. Love you, mom. Sleep tight, baby. Night, dad. All right, 5 minutes. [door closes] I don't like lying. I know, But it's important. No one can know i'm here. Why not? 'cause... If they find out, Something bad will happen.
