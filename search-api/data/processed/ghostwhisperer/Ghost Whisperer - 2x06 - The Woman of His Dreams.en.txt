I live in a small town,</i> and I own an antique shop.</i> I might be just like you. Except that from the time I was a little girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i> Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.</i> They're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living</i> and they come to me for help.</i> In order to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.</i> - Is this the house? - This is it. - Great. - Let me get that for you. Thank you so much. - Josie. - Jeb. ***** Cheer up. It'll be over before you know it. Oh, I'm so happy to see you. Come on in. I already startedsetting up for you. Fantastic. Thank you. You are free to go downstairs and build something now. I've never felt the urge to hammer something so much in my life. Here. Take this. Drink it. Relax. Go. Take out your wallets. The bast cosmetics repis here. Hey, ladies. How are ya? All this fabolous products here! ***** melinda, can iborrow your husband? ***** it'll just take a minute. - Jim, right? - Yeah. But, um... just come sit down. Now, jim here- have a seat- has combination skinas anyone can see. I have a very effective line of oil-freemoisturizers for men that will balance out jim's ph brilliantly. If I can just find it... Ah, here it is. Now, as you can see, it doesn't take much. I'm basically padding the product on jim's t-zone- here and here. There. I know. Isn't it a great look? Well, it was a pretty good look before you put it on, too. Well, that was fun. Thank you. But I should go plow the north 40 now. It's ok. Go. You're a champ. Josie, I know you have reat stuff for all of us, too. Right? Oh, right. Let me show you... I'm comfortable with my masculinity. That would have put me into therapy for a couple of years. Honey, what's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost. Really? Here? Where? Right in front of me. I'm glad the party it's over. How 'bout now? Ahh, it's gone. That was beyond creepy. Yeah, skull where my face was supposed to be. That's not good. Is that some kind of portent of doom? No, no. At least I don't think so. All right. What about ghosts? Do you see any right now? No. Nothing. Hey, what's wrong? Let's just get out of the house and go for a walk. So, uh, have you heard from your mother yet? She said she will call me if they can move the surgery up a day. Her poor knee. But the good news is josie did sell $350 worth of her stuff. Guess what the big seller was. I don't think I want to know. Moisturizer for men. Comforting to know that if you do not do well in the medical industry, you could be a male model. You know, you're killing me right here. You're killing me. I think it's great that I have a husband women find so attractive. You  know, it's funny. 'Cause that feeling doesn't cut both ways. - Not for me. - That's because you're ossessive. Guys have the whole caveman thing going on. That's right! - I want my woman for myself. - Ooh. You got her. All right. Ahh, ohh! Hey, beautiful, where did you come from? - What do you see? - A cat. - A ghost cat? - An exotic looking one. - What happened? - Kitty not as cute as I thought. - Go away, kitty. - Where is homer the dog when you need him? Yeah. Where is homer? I miss homer. Not today's problem. - Hey, do you hear that? - No... I don'T. - I don't hear anything. - How weird is that. Ok. That's just a phone. Mom. Oh, well, that's great news! Tuesday. The sooner the better. Stop it. Ok. No, no. I'm sorry. Yeah. No, it's not a problem. Ok, well, I'll call you tomorrow. - By Mrs. Gordon. - Bye. Stop it... Now, she says, "it's just knee surgery. There's no need to go to so much trouble. Mom? Mom?! Now what if your mother really doesn't want anyone around her right now? Well, that's too bad. 'Cause I'm not one to ignore dreams. Especially dreams like that one. Look, it was probably a guilt trip. Oh, well, thank you, Freud. I'll call you as soon as I get there. Wait a minute. Don't drive crazy. I have to go. I'll miss you. It's my poker night any how. Um, that's where you're supposed to say I'll miss you, too, honey. - Yeah. - Yeah. I always do. Hey, have the game at our house. No, that never really works out. Why not? You guys take turns don't you? Yeah. It's been my turn for a couple of weeks now. And I keep trying to avoid it. You know, unexpected visitors and such. Hey, I'm gone. The ghosts are gone. Have the game at the house. Huh. Right. Call me. Maybe. Bye. - 3 queens. - You've been playing queens all night. Well, what can I say, guys? The ladies love me tonight. So, clancy, game at your house? Man that almost never happens He wants to keep us away from melinda, doesn't trust us. - Would you? - Good point. We played here a few months ago. Yeah, when his wife was out of town. Yeah, where is she now, clancy? -  Out of town. - Yeah. Jim clancy, master electrician. ***** - All around the horn. - Uh, I'll go 2. - You gotta good card, man. - Now that's tension. No, I didn't do anything. I was holding them normal. - Yeah, right. - Do it again. - Flaher, you ok? - Flaher? Flaher?! Flaher? 1, 2, 3. Got it? We got? You in? What? Am I in? What? I almost just died right in front of ya. - Almost doesn't count. - You're cold. Hey, I'll tell you what. It's gettin' a little late. All right... I gotta checivo. My house next week. Thanks for coming, guys. Who are you? Yeah? Hey, amarillo slim. Did I wake you? No. No. No. No. Well, yeah. A little. - How's your mother? - Asleep. Right. Of course she would be now.</i> She a little worried about tomorrow?</i> No, she's good. We ordered in chinese food and rented a movie. It was nice, actually. Ooh, can you do me a favor tomorrow and just drop in on delia at the store? I want to make sure she doesn't get too overwhelmed. - Delia, right. Ok. - Are you... are you all right? I was having a really weird dream. Uh. Well, welcome to my world. Mel, you know I really love you. - I really do. - Jim, I love you, too. Listen, just go back to sleep. Ok? Call me in the morning. Thanks so much for coming in. We're gonna be online soon. So look us up. Hey, jim. To what do I owe this honor? Oh, nothing, you know. I just thought I'd drop by, say hi before work. See if everything's ok. So melinda was worried that I'd be overwhelmed? Yeah. Exactly. See? I'm getting to know her like a book. Hey, how's her mom? Oh, her mom should be out of surgery in a couple of minutes now. What? What? No, no. It's- I'm  so sorry! I just have this thing about bugs. Apparently so do I. - Friends of yours? - Houseguests. Some people have ants, other people have termites. - You have beetles? - I don't know what I have. Did you see which way they went? Somewhere where I'll never see them again I hope. All right, I gotta go. I should go. Look, you havemy cell, right? And you can call me in case anything goes wrong? Yeah. Just as long as the beetles don't form a gang and come after me, I think I'll be fine. Ok. If they do, call me. Yeah, she sailed through the operation. I'll feel better when I can see her. I can't get that surgery dream out of my head. - How's your hangover? - What hangover? Oh, come on. You were on a different planet last night. I sensed the presence of a 6-pack at least. You sensed the presence of something but it wasn't alcohol related. Wait, you had a ghost last night without me? Well, something strange is going on.</i> Last night there were lights flickering, cards flying, and there were bugs-beetles- I saw them on the floor. They were just swimming in my shirt. - Ooh, kinky. - I'm serious. - Sorry. - What kind of beetles? - Shiny green things. Kind of beautiful actually. Look, mel, last night I had this dream- this weird dream- there was this girl and she was on an operating table. - Same dream as mine. - Not exactly. She had a cat, which reminds me, you remember you saw this exotic ghost cat? Why  would the cat be in your dream? You're  asking me like I know the answer. Sorry. Thinking out loud. - Was there anything besides beetles? - Scalpel. - As in surgery? - And sharp. Ok, this has to be about my mother. I'm getting a little freaked out. So I'm gonna go in and check on her. Well, what do I do? Well, we have to find out what the connection is between the symbols. Do you remember the guy I was telling you about... professor payne? Yeah. Yeah. The guy at rock land U. Go and see him. Ok? He knows all about symbols and the supernatural. He'll be able to tell you if there's a connection. Wait. I just show up there? I don't even know the guy. No, it's ok. He's a good guy. He just doesn't know about what I can do. - So keep it all theoretical. - Theoretical? - I gotta go. - I love you, bye. - Theoretical. Hey, uh, sorry, man. I'm looking for a professor, a dr. Payne. So are half the credit card companies in the U.S. - What can I do for you? - You're payne? - You are...? - Sorry. I was expecting somebody older. Why don't you come back in 25 years? Hey, I'm jim clancy. I'm melinda gordon's husband. You know, she comes by for help sometimes. You're melinda's husband. Wow, this is really very interesting. Yeah. She's out of town. But she sent me over- - Your wife fascinates me. - Me, too. Look, some times she says you help her. And I'm working on this project, and I was wondering if you could give me a hand. - What kind of project? - Uh, I'm writing a book. Everybody's doing it these days. Melinda told me you were a paramedic. Yeah. I am. Yeah. See? It's a hobby. - Saving lives is a hobby? - No, writing. - Oh, the writing's the hobby. - Um, I'm a little lost right now. I've been playing with all this symbolism. Cats, for instance. And I... Here you go, melinda's husband. Take your pick. - How about that one? - Excellent. Abyssinian. Egyptian. Very spooky looking, huh?. You know, the ancient egyptians, they were crazy about cats, jim. If you killed a cat, you had to be killed. If your cat died, you went into mourning. You had to shave off your ebrows while in mourning. That must-that must have been a fantastic look. Right. Ok. What if in this story I throw in some beetles, what would that start to signify? - Well, that would depend. - On what? - On the beetle. I've always been partial to george. I'm joking. That's a joke. Guess melinda hasn't told you a lot about me. Nope. No, no. She just said you were a great guy. Well, then you've been sadly misinformed. - What color are these beetles? - Green. And they're shiny. Green? Those are scarabs. There's a lot of egyptian symbolismin your book. Could be. - Here you go... Dung beetles. - That one. Used a lot in egyptian iconography, usually symbolizing regeneration and rebirth. Right. So if I was- uh, if my main character was seeing- getting sent these symbols, what do you think that would mean? Could mean a lot of things. It could mean beauty, egypt. It could mean the goddess isis, she's the most powerful, most popular. But you have cats. That's a powerful motif. That would make me think of the goddess bast. Bast was the protector of cats and women. - Did you just say "bast?" - Bast, yeah. Just now. Bast cosmetics. Do you know bast cosmetics? Cosmetics? I'm not, um... that's not my area of expertise. You know, doc, you helped me a lot. I owe you one. Thanks. You're leaving? Wait. Do-do you guys do this all the time, the two of you? - What? - The whole I'm saying something, but I'm not tell you what I mean. I'm being wacky and evasive thing. Do you both do it? I don't know what you're talking about. Yea. Like that. That's-that's good. What do you want? So the ghost is attached to bast cosmetics? Bast is all about beauty. She was the protector of cats. - And their logo is a beetle and a cat. - So, this girl from your dream... - what was she like? - Scary. - Was she beautiful? - She wasn't exactly homely. Ugh, jim, come on. I can take it. Spit it out. Was she beautiful? She's drop dead gorgeous. She looks like a model. A simple yes would have done. Hey, hey, you just said- Look, how many times exactly have your dream of this drop deadgorgeous model? Mel, I want the dreams to end just as much as you do. Ok. Obiously your visions and dreams have nothing to do with my mother. So she must be connected to bast cosmetics. - Maybe she's a model. - Was one of their models. - Dead? - Don't you think? Well, then why is she coming to me? I don't know. Maybe she was attached to somebody at the makeover party. Oh, thank you. Or maybe she's using you to get to me. All right, well, how do we find her? I don't know. Bast is a small company. But they still advertise. So... you'll have to go to a newsstand, get some magazines, and look for her picture. I'll talk to you later. Come back soon. Bye. There you are. Do you have smithsonian? Uh, yeah, it's over there behind national geographic. Excuse me. Sorry. Ahh, you're... - Jim. - Jim-melinda's husband. Right. And you're dr. Payne, right? Yes, I am. How's the book coming? Slowly. Ok. That's one les angelique, one fashion today, one wardrobe plus, one tween chique magazine. - Anything else? - No, thanks. - Melinda's still out of town? - She's coming back soon. $750? I know it's a lot. But it's totally worth it. This woman will come and do all your colors. What you look best in. What's you power color. What's your calming color. So what's your throw away money color? Wait-isn't that melinda's husband? Hmm. Nice sedway. Hey, well, if it isn't my guinea pig. Hope you're using that moisturizer. Yeah. Yeah. All the guys in the firehouse have noticed a big difference. Jim, have you ever thought about having your colors done? - Sorry? - Pay no attention. Hey, guys, I was wondering if you could do me a favor. You probably know more about this kind of stuff than I do. - Do you know who she is? - Oh, my god. That's eva turner. I- I'm sorry but that just caught me by surprise. - Eva-eva was a friend of mine. - Was? - Yeah, she died a couple of weeks ago. - And why do you ask? Uh, a friend of mine- one of the guy sat the firehouse he's he's really into models and especially her. So, when I saw the bast cosmetics, I thought maybe I could get an address. He wanted to send a fan letter. That kind of thing. Hmm. Oh, well. She used to live in my building. She was the one that got me into selling bast cosmetics. - She was so nice. - How did she die? Ahh, that's the horrible thing. She went in for an appendectomy, a routine. Something went wrong with the anesthesia, and she just died. We're going to the memorial tomorrow in the city. - Oh, yeah. Where? - All saints chapel. Sorry to interrupt your lunch. And sorry about that. See ya, delia. - Take care, jim. - Died during surgery? Well, that explains the hospital dreams and the scalpel appearing. Yeah, there's a memorial service tomorrow in the city, at a chapel. - And in your dreams? - Exactly. People praying. Well, she wants you to go to that memorial. There's something or someone there you're suposed to see. Don't you think it'll look little strange, I mean, if I go? Yeah, if you go alone, so take somebody with you and blend in. Who? Dude, I'll tell you, this is a little weird. - I don't even know the deceased. - I know. Think of it as show of support. That's  like something from e! Channel. - Are you-do you know these people? - Not exactly. - Lookin' for someone? - Not really. You have some parallel life you haven't told me about? I mean, are you an underwear model by night or something? Flaher, just go with me on this one, ok? Remember, I saved your life the other night. - Who-who's that? - Who? Other side of the aisle, purple. Looks familiar. That's delia. Delia banks. She works with melinda at the store. Linda's a beautiful woman. - Funny, but I know her. - Who? That woman. She lived in the town I grew up in. I used to mow their lawn. Eva. Eva, eva. Eva kaminsky. That's eva kaminsky. I know this girl. - Isn't that why we're here? - Right. It's just, I went to high school with her and she was... really shy. It's hard to imagine that... that girl turned into that girl. Please take your seats. I am marybeth kaminsky, eva's mother. Thank you all so much for coming. Eva would be very happy to know so many peoplecame for her. A child shouldn't ever die before their mother. No one's child. Eva was the light of our lives. She was so beautiful, not just on the outside, but on the inside, too. I remember- Surprised to see you here, jim. Look at you. You grew up so nice! - Thanks. - How's your mother? - She's good, thanks for asking. - Oh, you're welcome. She moved on up a couple of years ago, I think. Well, that's nice. I cannot tell you how sorry I am about eva. I didn't even know she was going into the hospital. I mean, she was always so terrified of doctors and hospitals and... she probably just, uh, didn't want us to be worried, so... remember how she was always obsessed with people's feelings? I just remember her being very shy. But she made us so proud. I mean, to open a magazine and seeher right in there. So beautiful, so confident. Just exactly the way I wanted her to be. I... I never thought she'd go so far. Linda. Linda's the one I thought would bein the spotlight. Jim clancy. Hi. What a surprise. Eva would so love that you came. You know, I don't think she'd even remember me. Oh, she would. She talked about you. She said you gave her a great gift. Well, listen, I really have to get back to upton. I don't like to come into the city very much 'cause it really makes me kinda nervous, so... so good to see you. - Bye. Please come visit us. - I will. Hey, can I ask you- who's that woman? Oh, that's diana lassiter. She was eva's agent. She's mine now, too. - Ok, so, you'r real model, too? - Soon, I hope. I've got a lot of head shots out there. Did you get help from your sister? Everything. She had the whole thing down. - She was totally focused. - That's good, I guess. Yeah, she overcame a lot. She, uh, fought really hard. Mostly with herself, but... she came out on top. She gave herself that power, you know? And then this happened. I better get back to my mother. Thank you. I hope you come see us soon. Take care, linda. - You're jim's friend. - Yeah, tim flaherty. - You're delia banks, right? - That's right. Nice of you to come. Yeah, well, I- - You must bein hog heaven here. - Come again? I mean, with all the models. Jim told me you had a thing for models. Oh, jim told ya. Nah. Too skinny. Really? Yes, Mrs. Lassiter, I'm from eva's hometown. I've never met anyone from eva's real life. I didn't really know her. I used to work for her parents when I was young mowing lawns, things like that. I hadn't actually seen her since I moved away. Oh. She was a friend and a client for about 5 years. Hey, uh, you represent her-her sister linda, right? Well, we'll see if she has what it takes. She might. She's certainly beautiful. Yeah, she's that, but, um, it takes more than that. - It takes a certain toughness. - Did eva have that? I mean, that toughness? Look, I loved eva like a sister, but... she was a bit of a wreck. A wreck? You know, I think she might have been a little freaked out that her sister was gonna be a model. You know, I think maybe eva thought that she'd replace her. How could she worry about being old when she wasn't even 30? She's practically a senior citizen in this business, honey. There was something more than that, though. She was trying to prove something to somebody, and the more successful she got, the more she was afraid of losing it. - I've seen it happen. - Thanks for your time. - It was nice talking to you. - And you. Take care. Eva... if you're here, I wish I could help you. I wish I knew what you wanted... what you needed. I don't even know why you remember me. You were just a kid. You were too shy to even say hello. Hi. I'm jim clancy. You're the prettiest girl here. Don't forget that. Person who made me feel pretty. Jim, I'm home. I didn't even remember it. Well, obviously she did. How can a ghost put some thing like that in my head? She has a strong connection with you. Sometimes we have no idea the effect we can have on other people. You know, it's things that we forget are turning points for someone else. You were a kind man, even then. All right, we know whys he's coming to me, but we still don't know what she wants. Well, what did her mother say at the memorial? Her mother didn't even know she was in the hospital. She thinks eva didn't want her to worry. So, maybe she just wants to apologize to her mother. I think it's more than that. In the chapel, when her mother was speaking, the doors blew open, there was all this wind. You know, it was like she didn't want her to finish. Hmm, that kind of wind usually means that a ghost is mad, so maybe she led you to her mother, and not just to apologize. Yeah, but what do we do? It's your ghost, what do you think? go see her mother. Good, all right. Hopefully eva will be there and we'll get this whole thing sorted out. Have I told you how glad I am that you're back? You can show me. I'm very sorry for your loss. Oh, thank you. You didn't have to come all this way just to say that. Actually, mary beth, there's another reason we're here. This may sound strange or funny, even, but I think... we think eva's still here. Yes, I know. She'll-she'll always be here with us. Um, we mean literally. Heh. Are you saying what I think you're saying? Ask her to say all those nice things about me again. Uh, she's here. Ok, look, if you guys are trying to comfort me, it's really not working, and, in fact, I think it's really a little creepy, so- she wants you to say some more nice things about her. - Yeah. - What? I want to hear more. Except she did leave a few things out. She's talking about the memorial. She says that you left a few things out when you talked about her. Oh! This is ridiculous. I have to go. She didn't mention how she used to tell me how I shouldn't expect too much from life because homely girl shad it hard. She feels like you criticized her. How are you doing this? - What is this? - Eva's here with us. Right now. Why'd you do that to me, mom? Why'd you tell me my nose looked too big in pictures? Not that I'd ever beas beautiful as linda, but so at least I could be presentable! She feels like you compared her to linda. I never criticized her. Yeah, I was hard on her, but look at the career she had because I pushed her never to be satisfied. She's just tryingto tell you that you made her feel bad about herself. They were only words. They might have just been words, mom, but I believed in every single one of them because they came from you. What the hell's going on here? Didn't you know I just wanted to be seen as beautiful in your eyes? I tried to change erything about myself to please you until there was nothing left for you to criticize! She can't hear you. You said that you wanted to change everything about yourself. You didn't goin to the hospital to have an appendectomy, did you? Diana knows the truth. She helped me. I know you were friends with eva back in the day, but what you're asking for is some very private information. All right, that's true, but... it's important to me, and to us, to her family. We think we know what happened. We just want you to confirm it. - I don't know if it's even ethical. - Your client's dead. If you can shed some light on that, or give her family some closure, - how could that not be ethical? - Did you know eva? - I've met her. - What do you think happened? I think she went to a hospitalfor plastic surgery and something went wrong. How did you find out? It's not important right now. I tried to tell her not to do it, that she didn't need it, but she was never satisfied with her looks, never. All right, but what went wrong in the surgery? Eva was on diet pills. She didn't tell the doctor. She had a bad reaction to the anesthetic. Well, thank you for being honest with us. Diana, I know that you're trying to protect eva, but you have to tell her family. Oh, po-why keep that wound open? Why not just let them heal? The truth heals, and they deserve to know. - And there's one more thing. - What? We have to be with you when you tell them. I can't believe she didn't tell us about this. I'm sorry. I would have told you sooner, but I wanted to respec ther privacy. And then melinda and jim thought you had a right to know. I want diana to tell my sister something. Diana, eva wants you to tell linda something. What? I'm-I'm sorry? What is this? She's here with us. What is she talking about? She wants you to tell linda about the pills. Well, I-yeah, I told you. She was on diet pills, and she forgot to tell- she didn't tell the doctor. And diana told men ot to tell him. She told me he wouldn't do the surgery if he knew. You told her that the doctor would refuse the operation if he knew about the pills. And it was the pills and the anesthesia that killed her. You also told her that it would add 10 years to her career. Excuse me, are you trying to blame me for this? She wanted that surgery. She wanted it. She's not trying to blame anyone. I just don't want my sister to buy into this. I don't want her to listen to diana. She's worried about you. She doesn't want you to listen to diana or anyone. Just... listen to yourself. But I wanted to be like eva. That's all I was trying to do. She overcame everything. I overcame nothing. I never looked inside. I turned myself into what other people wanted me to be. She's saying that she hasn't overcome anything. She just became who other people wanted her to be. No, that's not true. When I realized I was dead, I didn't remember the money or the magazines or even my own face. I remembered that one sweet moment at the high school dance. And when she dies, I want her to leave behind a life full of real things. I want her to live from the inside. - Can you tell her that? - I promise. Is that where I'm supposed to go? She sees the light. She's ready to cross over now. She's here, I can feel her. She's gonna be ok. Yes, she is. Eva, for whatever its worth... I spoke to your mother at the memorial service and... I saw how much she loved you. How proud she was of you, I saw it in her eyes. It was real. Well, it's time to say good-bye. Take care, eva. Well... I think that you and i should talk. Please. You know, I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I don't know how you do this on a daily basis. I feel like I need to lie down for 6 weeks. Yeah, well, my ghosts aren't quite as fascinating as yours. Oh, yeah, fascinating. I'm sure am gonna miss the beetles and the scalpels. Oh, and the tearing off of faces, I'll agree. Oh, well. At least she was easy on the eyes. Yep. That she was. But the most beautiful woman in my world... is right here. She's pretty easy on the eyes. Welcome home, dream girl. Come here.
