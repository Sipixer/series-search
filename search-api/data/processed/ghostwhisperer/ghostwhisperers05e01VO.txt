Haven't you ever noticed that every yearit's something? Yeah,i mean,last year, Aiden fell outof that bouncerand needed stitches. The year before that,i walked into the plate glass door. Yep. And when he wastwo,he spiked thatcrazy high fever. Yeah,well,look at him now. Aiden's the best one. He is so much coolerthan the other kids. - Even if he can't do tricks. - All right,eli. What? - The watchers saidhe'd have super powers. - They said he would be powerful. Are you talking aboutaiden's super powers? Ok,both of you,enough. - Ready,aiden? - Ok. - But aren't you curious? - Ready? I mean,he's five now,and look at him. He's just so happy and normal. Yeah,you can imagine my concern, 'cause what mother would want a happy,normal kid? Yeah,but this is not about what you want. His life,his gift,may serve a larger purpose. Who's going to help me withthe goodie bags? I'm there. Come on,you guys. Oh! Hi! Hey,aiden,those goodie bagsare for your guests. Happy birthday to you.

Look,they're gonna runsome tests on him tonight,It'll be ok. They said that his bloodpressure is normal. - And his heart is fine. - Melinda... They're not goingto find anything. Where are we? We're at the hospital. Did we come to pick up daddy? You don't remember anything? Did i fall asleepin the car? No,baby. Come here. Do they really haveto keep him overnight? That's good,he'll getsome sleep. Mel,there's got to be a medicalcause for this. I'm telling you,it was the ghost,i saw her. You see a lot of ghosts,all right? - And i've seen youexperience a lot of hideous things. - Only whatthey've experienced. I know,in a new vision,but then its overand you're fine. So is aiden,physically. I mean,he doesn't remember a thing. This time. What if it happens again? I don't know. I don't knowwho the ghost is. Does aiden? Mom? Hey,sweetheart. - How you doing? - Good. Where's dad? He's doing his rounds. Then we're all goingto go to breakfast, And your daddy's going to take you home. Ok. And then i'm going to figure out what made you sick. But i'm not sick. Aiden,do you remember anything about last night, Before you fell asleep?Did you... See someone? You mean a ghost? Yes. Just the lady. The onewho sings to me. Sings to you? Happy birthday. Have you seen her before? I see herevery year. Do you know who she is? No. But she always remember my birthday. Always. She always remembersmy birthday. How long is "Always"To a little kid,do you think? I believe him. I mean,all the illnesses,the accidents, Every year on his birthday,something bad has happened To aiden or jim or me. I think she's been there, And i think she's been with us every year. Yeah,but is she haunting aidenor the whole family? And why onlyon that day? What?Five second rule. If it is every year,How come he hasn't mentioned her until now? 'cause he seesghosts all the time. Yeah,but they didn'taffect him. Not like the way this one did. Maybe she's feeding offof his strength. Maybe she knows that he's-- What,that he can see ghosts,Just like every kid his age? Yeah,but he isn't likeany other kid his age. Not according to the watchersor the book. What about the book? You know,we've beenstudying the bookfor years now. Ned's practicallymajoring in it. When i heardabout what happenedlast night, I went to the page with your name on it,The onethat predictedaiden's birth. You know,sometimesthe book of changes.Actually,uh,changes. There's beena new entry. It's about your son. Ok,so what does that mean for aiden? We don't know.but that writing,that's latin. It says,"When the leaves fall,So will the innocent." But maybe the ghostis part of the prophecy. Maybe she's part of what's supposed to happen. What,to aiden? Is that what we're really talking about right now, 'cause it's notgonna happen. And i want this ghostto stay away from my son. Ok,but we don't even knowwho she is. Look,the... The clock stoppedright-- right before Aiden got better last night. And it happened once before. The night he was born. Cross match two unitsof packed cells, Start an i.v. Line and get some oxygen. The patientwas losing blood. I think she died in that hospital The night my son was born. 11:48 p.m. Does jim like working here? Yeah,he loves it. I'm just glad we didn'thave to move for his residency. But you feel it,too,right? I mean,every time i treat a patient here, As soon as i walkinto the building... Yeah,i feel it. Lost souls,you know? But it's a hospital. People die here. No,i workedin a lot of hospitals. There's something different about this one. This is her.amber heaton. She was only 20 when shedied of an aortic rupture as a result of childbirth. **** Don't you darethreaten my son. I don't have to. It's already done. Hi. He's mine. How we doin'? Better,thanks. Look,this might not bethe best time to tell you, But...well,actually,maybe it's perfect. Look,remember how i promised aiden That i would take himanywhere he wanted to go After i missed his party? Well,look,i caved. I told him that i wouldtake him to pickwick's fun factory - And bowling alley. - pickwick's,really? Yeah. Look,and i told him It was a once in a lifetime trip, And i also told himnever to bother youabout it again. Jim,it's fine. It's your party. Pickwick's is fine? Melinda... What's a matter? The ghost. I think she believesthat her son's spiritwent into aiden. Wait,like what happenedto me? Like a step-in? It would explain why she showed mehis body at the morgue, Why she wrote "He's mine" In blood. It's not so impossible,really. I mean...they both had traumatic deliveries. She died duringchildbirth. I'm sure if we had stayed at that morguea little longer, We would have found outthat her son died,too. Yeah,but how didhe get into aiden? Think about it. Aiden was blue. His heartwasn't pumping. We don't know that he didn't die for a split second, But long enough forher son to go in. Honey,you don't believe that,do you? Not in my heart. No. But it would explain some things. Like,why doesn'the have super powers? Hey,you know,you've justbeen talking to eli too much. I mean,i would love himthe same,either way. He's my son. But i can't help but wonder that... Maybe he'd be better offif he wasn't. Why? Why,becausethe book says-- "When the leaves fall,so will the innocent." Jim,i'm worried. What if i don't knowwhat's coming? What if i can'tprotect him? Hello? Before i tell youwhat i got, Can we just take a moment to appreciate How good a friend i am? What'd you get? Well,the moment i pictured Was a little bit longerthan that,but ok. I got all the medicalrecords on your ghost. How? Jim askedall of hishospital contacts. I treat people there. I have my own system passwords. I entered a patient nameincorrectly, Like,illegally incorrectly. Which is why i thought maybea thank you,you know,would-- Ok,thank you. What'd you find out? First of all,it's no coincidence That the ghostis attached to you. You were right.she died in the o.r., The delivery roomnext to yours. Ok. So what happenedto amber's baby?I mean,did he die? Almost. His blood supplywas cut off and he coded, But he was revived with no permanenttissue or brain damage. Thank god. Ok,so then what? Then what,what? If amber thinksthat her baby died And came back as aiden,which obviously he didn't. So where is he now? **** Wait,it says in his medical records that he was adopted? They had to indicate custody. Amber was dead. Ok,do these parentshave names? No dice. Closed adoption. Ok,we got 'em,we got 'em! Out at 23:48. - He isn't breathing. - why isn't he breathing? **** Jim,stay with him,i think he's not breathing. He's ok! Amber? Where are you? Amber? - We need to talk. - I want my baby. You're trying to take him away from me. I'm not trying to take anything away from you. You told him he doesn'thave to see meif he doesn't want to. Oh,when i told himthat he didn't haveto see ghosts? That's what got you upset? I'm his mother. A child ought to bewith his mother. You really think that you're aiden's mother. What makes you so sure? There wasn't any timefor pain medication, So i still feeleverything. I was bleedingso badly. My baby was dyinginside of me. They were racing to get him out, But even when they got him free, He was too weak. He wouldn't breathe. I kept trying to tell themto show me my son, But they wouldn'tlet me speak. I saw two nurses rush him away. I couldn'tfight it anymore. One of the nursescame back. She said something to the other nurse. I knew it meantmy baby was dead. I kept screaming at them to tell me what had happened, But they couldn'thear me. I waited to take himinto the light, But he didn't come. And then i heard him. He was alive. He might have to livein another form,but my son was alive. But you didn't see his spiritgo into my son's body,did you? I didn't have to. That child,the one you call aiden,he's mine. If he's yours,then why wouldyou hurt him? Why would you want him to suffer? - I would never do that. - But you did. You gave himthose symptoms. No. I didn't. I was just watching him.I was just watching my son. Amber,there's somethingthat you need to know. Your son's spiritdidn't need another Child's bodybecause he didn't die. But those nurses... They were probably talking about you. And what a tragedy it was that you nevergot to hold your son. I don't understand.if he's still alive,where is he? He was adopted. - That can't be. - it's true. And it's reallygood news. - He went straight to the family that you chose for him. - I chose? It was a closed adoption. That meansthere was a contract.You probably agreedto it in advance. No,that's notpossible.I didn't want that. what do you mean? I can't do this! Yes,you can,you have to! Was that the adoptive father? **** That messagewas for the nurses. You changed your mindabout the adoption.You wanted to keep your baby. They can't have him. It's too late. Amber,he belongsto them now. He belongs with me! You're not going to find them. In closed adoptions,the birth parents,adopted parents, - The records are sealed. - Well,i have to find them. I mean,you should haveseen how angry she was. At you? No,the adoptive father.they were arguing. Arguing? They shouldnever have even met. What were theyarguing about? She changed her mind.it sounded like he was threatening her. You know,maybe he was going to take her to court. Yeah,but don'tthe adoption laws Protectthe birth mother? It always allows for a change of heart. I mean, He would not havea leg to stand on. Unless... Unless he had his own rights. Parental rights, Like the kind you would get if you were the blood father. Adopting your own kid?I mean,why would he do that? She was 20 years old. He looked likehe was in his late thirties,I'm gonna guess married. How did they get involved? The ghost obitsaid that she was An internat ufland consulting. There he is,the guyshe was arguing with,dale harmon. Hi,my name is melinda gordon. isten,dale's son goes to school with mine. Does he have a minute? Right,yeah,he's at tyler'sbirthday party,of course. Tell himthat aiden is a guest. Right.you know,actually,We were supposed to be there, But we lost our invite. Can you tell mewhere the party is? Thank you. What? What's wrong? They're at pickwick's. So?That's where jim took aiden.They're at the same place. I'm so sorry,but just this once,can you watch the store? Yes,of course.i still have my key. But relax,mel,that's a coincidence. Yeah,i used to believein coincidence. What happened? I read a book that changed my mind. Too badwe couldn't bowl.

Are they in danger? Aiden isn't,if he stays where he is. What about tyler? Aiden... Please hear me. Just stay where you are. Ok,and make surethat tyler stays with you. - Come here! - No,i'm scared! - You're not safe there!- How do you know? I don't know. I just know. Quick!**** **** - Aiden! - Tyler! - Mommy! - Honey,are you ok? - Hey! Aiden!- Mommy! Hold on,ok? Just hold on. - Are you ok? - Yeah,i'm fine. I made tyler stay with me,like i was supposed to. Who told you thatyou're supposed to? I don't know. Did i make a mistake? No! No,baby,you did great. - are you sure you're ok? - Yeah,i'm ok,mommy. How are you doing? Oh,still a little rattled. Do youhave any decaf? Yeah,i think so. Well,the boysseem ok. Thanks. I think amber'sready to talk now. Oh,why don't i give your husband a hand with the boys? I'm sorry about whati did in that place. I didn't know i could do that. She's sorry about what happenedwith the boys, And she didn't knowher own strength. Yeah,well,i'm sorry,too. Can you tell her why? I'm not proud of whati did back then. It was a hard time for me and emily, But that's no excuse. So then what happened? They were trying really hard to get pregnant, - But it wasn't working out. - My wife and i were having problems. I'd stay late at the office And amber was alwaysright there, Just ready to listen. There was a partyto celebratelanding a new client. There was someoffice party,and... I know,it's a clich? I never thought i coulddo something like that. It was one time. One time,and i was pregnant. I knew i hadto have the baby, But i was 20 years old. I thought i had my wholelife in front of me. Emily,she--we--really,really wanted children. We'd alreadydecided to adopt When amber cameto me,pregnant. So you thoughta closed adoptionwould be perfect Because then your baby would have a home. Without anger or resentment, And his wifewould never know. And then shechanged her mind. At the last moment,i thought i could do it. I could raise my son. I didn't know what would happen. I didn't know howshe'd treat if she ever knew the truth. Is she here? Yeah. It's ok,emilyknows everything.I told herthat night. When the man you love,trusted, Comes to you withsomething like this... It can turn your heart to stone. Unless you're holdinga baby in your arms. Watching him grow... Knowing he needs you. He needs love. He needed us. Because the young girlwho loved him and gave him life Lost her own. I sawthat before. But i felt so alone. So scared for him. But i know you're oknow,aren't you,sweetheart? Tell themto be good to him. To keep loving him. She wants you to love him. The way that she would have. We will. I think we always have. And one day when he's ready, We'll tell himall about you. She's gone. - Bye!-Bye! i've got company. I'll be inside. Ok. So how long have you known? Known what? How long have you knownwhat my son can do? You mean what you twocan do together? Look,we're connected. I've always know that somehow, But... The visions i've had,they've been from aiden? How do they come to him? I mean,is he--is he a sensitive? The word you'relooking for is "Empath." He can shareother people's feelings, Their experiences. That's why he's sickand then gets better. Why he turned blue and couldn't talk. It's like he'sexperiencing something That somebody else has already been through somehow. Like the day he was born. And every birthday since. Her symptoms, She relived them,and he relived themright along with her. And you relivedsome of it,too,through him. Hi. Tea? You want a refill? I would love a whisky sour. Sometimes i just wishyou were less of a watcherand more of a talker. I mean,peoplealmost got hurt. That's how we learn.all of us,living and dead. And besides,it's the rules. God,you have an answerfor everything. If i did... There would be no need for us to watch,would there? What are we going to tell him? Nothing,not about this. You don't want him to know he's connected to you? No. If he did,then he'd know that his dreamsaren't really his. I want his dreamsto belong to him,like any little boy. I heard your voices. I thought you were my dream. No. But you're our dream.
