- It's alright, honey. You and your grandmother are the only ones here who could see me. Will you help me? That's my wife. We've been together for 26 years. Then I had to go. I had to go so quickly, I didn't have time to say goodbye to her. Didn't have enough time to tell her how much I love her. And she really needs to hear it now. Will you give her that message for me? How will she know it's from you? Tell her I want her to keep having a glass of champagne every Friday night. I want her to light the fire like we always did. And make our secret toast to the moon and stars like we always did. And tell her to never feel alone. And then she'll know. I don't understand. I know honey. But you will. Can't we sneak out? They'll never miss us. We haven't collected all of our gifts yet. / Oh, true. Besides, your Uncle Benny might fall into the band stand and we can't miss that. I think he was dancing with Ann, that's what happened. She kicked him with her boots. Now, that may be the perfect couple. Don't tell me you see something. No... - No, no, no way. It's nothing. - That's good, that's good. Because it'll be nice to keep the celebration, you know? - Among the living. - The night is young. Hey. Don't tell me, I scared you. Very funny. I just didn't know if you were gonna make it. You kidding? Finally get to see my only brother settled down. You guys look pretty delirious to me. We're happy. We are, it's just... Jim is struggling with the job a bit. The only paramedic who hates the sign of blood. Someone died on him last week. First time, he's just having a hard time dealing with it. One time I took a head off a roof in college. Don't ask me what I was doing on the roof. Broke damn more bones than I knew I had. He was right there though. I was scared to death. - But the way he talked to me¡¦ - Yeah, I know. The thing about Jim is, he can take away your fear. He makes more of a difference than he knows. He would so love to hear that from you. I'm giving it to you. Save it for when he's really ready to throw in the towels. You'll know. Hey, Andrea. Boss, no way. You can not be here today. It's just for the afternoon. Jim's got some big surprise going he wants me to stay away from. And this is the only place you can think of to come? That is unbelievably sad for you. Speak and Understand Latin. A Conversation in Latin. Latin for dummies. Please not another hobby. It is not a hobby. I'm trying to improve my mind. I thought you were teaching yourself how to play the guitar. / I was. Wicked blisters though. Hey, you know. No one actually speaks Latin anymore. That is exactly what appealed to me about it. So, what does Jim have planned? I don't know. He's ubssesed with making up for no honeymoon. As well he should be. Well, let's see. Two weeks in Bermuda or Andrea's salary? Honeymoons are totally overrated. What's this? I don't know. I thought you brought it in. Well, I've seen it before. Or something like it. I shouldn't have that second bottle of wine. You know, you only have to do this for the doorway not the whole street. Well now she tells me. Alright, here we are. Final turn. Our first night in our new home. Let me make a note of that. Alright, step one. Move blind fold. Thank you. Step two... Close one eye. So, you'll only see the part of it that's almost finished. Damn, wrong eye. I love it. I love it, you must have worked like a month of nights. Yeah, don't be too impressed. The inside still looks like Lego Land. I don't care. It's our home. Our home. Bad one? The usual. Have anything to do with what you saw while we were dancing? I thought you were trying to give this a rest. Yeah, when you find the remote that turns it off, you let me know. I'm just worrying about you, that's all. - You're looking out for me, huh? - No, I'm looking out for me. You punch pretty hard during those damn dreams. Yeah, maybe I was faking those bad dreams. Just think you're backing a lot of pain. Other people's pain, not mine. Becomes yours. Look who's talking, Mr. Paramedics. - It's hard to get used to. - What? Being cared about so much. I know my business I'm taking it, I'm taking it, boss. Help me. In your house? Yeah, it never happened before. As we say in Latin. What did Jim say? You know I made an executive decision not to spoil the moment. Good call. So, is there a difference between a ghost that come right by your house and the ones you see on the street? No, they're all earth-bound spirits. Just some of them are stuck heremore than the others. Are there spirits here? Right now? - Only two. - Right... Here in this shop? Where? Well, there's an older woman sitting next to that guy with the lap top. Probably his mother. What do they look like? Well, if they have trouble coming through they look pretty scary but once they realize where they really are they start to look like you and me. Go talk to her. And the espresso guy? There's an older guy standing right behind him talking to him in Spanish. He doesn't understand why his son can't hear him. Okay, you are really freaking me out. Are you saying that Village Drava is haunted? No, places aren't haunted. People are haunted. So, then why is this guy haunting you? He's lost. Jim? Hey? What are you doing? The wind. Threw the top off of things. I'm just trying it back on. Go back in bed. I'll be there in a minute. The window just came off in my hands. That? I meant for that to happen. Be careful. I don't know where I am. I need you to help me. They told me you could. Who told you? I don't know. You're not supposed to be in my home. This is not how this works. Please, I have to go home. My wife is pregnant. She doesn't know where I am. What do you see around you? I'm in a valley. A low valley. It's dark. Please help me. I don't know if I can. What's your name? Paul Adams. I'm a sergeant from Fort Driscol. Sorry, I know I said I'd be there at ten. I'm on my way. Na, it's okay. There aren't many customers anyway. Oh, stop trying to cheer me up. Oh! What? What? Are you okay? - Melinda? - Oh, yeah. I almost hit a dog. I may just be just a few more minutes. Vietnam War Sgt Paul Adams, Jun 1972, MIA I'm sorry about the mess. We had a meeting last night that unfortunately erupted into fibster cups. - Politics? - Baseball. So, your boy there, Paul Adams. He's from the village? Yeah, I think so. I'm trying to get the family's information on him. He was listed MIA in 1972 and my husband told me that I should come and see you. Cause if anyone should know, you would. I'm flattered above all the recognition. Okay, so how can I be at service? I don't really know. Draft records, Enlistment records anything that might trace his whereabouts the year he went missing. I know that he was stationed at Fort Driscol. Let me check on the computer at the back and see what comes up. I don't want to put you out. Oh, yeah. I much rather be sweeping up this day breed than helping a beautiful young thing such as yourself. You can see me, can't you? Oh, come on. You can to, see me. I'm not blind. Alright, yes, yes, I can see you. But you know what? It's really not a good time. It's a small thing. You have to tell Joe the key to the safe deposit box is in the pocket of my blue rain coat. I left it there the last time I had it and there's so many papersand insurance things... How can I tell him something like that? I mean, what's he gonna think? Excuse me... I am the one who's been hanging around here for who knows how long trying to find someone to let him know. So, who has the bigger problem? You or me? I came up with the same last name but only a first initial. Now there is an address but who knows? It could be a condo or a mall by now. Well, it's a good start. And I really appreciate it. Don't mention it. Anytime you want to come by for a little more skin related conversation, please do. Umm.. you know. You know what I really have a bad habit of doing? Sometimes I leave really important things in my coat pockets. I forget about them. What the hell are you talking about? Will you just tell him? Okay, I know how this is gonna sound but I have a message from your wife. She wants you to know that the safe deposit box key is in her blue raincoat. Goodbye. Yes! Sorry, to bother you. Do you know if a family named Adams ever lived here? Still do. Want to buy? Tempting, especially cause it's already built and all. How long has it been in your family? And you are? Melinda Gordon. I live on the other side of the village. Michael Adams. My parents used to live here. When my mother died, I took it over. Are you Paul Adam's son? Why? He served in Vietnam. How do you know that? Sorry. I'm collecting information on some local Vietnam vets. And I found your father's name at the VFW post. I'm sorry, I can't really tell you much. But your father is listed MIA did the army ever give you any... No, they just said that he was MIA. Presumed dead three months before I was born. There's a mark at the cemetery. Nobody ever found him. I'm so sorry. Do you know what unit he was in? Yeah, 5th infantry. Red Diamonds. He had a brown star and a purple heart. He was an expert marksman. He was funny and reliable. That's at least what my mom said. He had very neat handwriting. And you said you couldn't tell me much. My mom used to tell me stories about him every night. She wanted me to know him. She wanted me to know that he was a hero. Please, tell me if you find out anything about my dad... Anything. It's amazing how much you can miss somebody you've never met. I will. But I don't want to keep you. Thanks for talking with me and I'll be in touch. Oh, my god. You must be dying to tell him. Tell him what? That his dead father was dripping mud in my living room last week? Point taken. Probably not the best move. Did he look like his father? - Yeah, a little. - Around the eyes. - Was he single by any chance? - No. But the thing is, his wife is like, 9 months pregnant. It made me realize something. Paul told me that his wife was pregnant. But what he doesn't realize is that it's his son's wife that's about to have a baby. Not his wife. You know, it really explains a lot. Right, although not to me. Whenever there's a big change in a family like a child is about to be born. It sends a ripple effect to the spirit world. It wakes up a spirit someone close. That is why Paul's here. Just really doesn't understand why yet. - You're gonna have to tell him. - I know. Just have to wait until he finds me again. Who told you that I could help you? Melinda! Hey, hey, it's okay. Just a dream. - Sorry. - Alright. You're helping someone, aren't you? I know I said I'd give it a rest but I can't... I can't help it. He's a solider and... You don't have to explain it to me. Well, come just ask me to keep it at arms length. Remember the magic word. Balance. Vietnam June 1972 Vietnam June 1972 Lo Valley Follow me. Paul, you told me that you were in a low valley of some kind. I think you might have actually been in the place called the Lo Valley. L- O and... I just need for you to remember your last day there. Remember what happened? Sometimes, I see bits and pieces. I remember being in a helicopter. I could see tracers coming up at us from the tree tops. I could feel the chopper slipping. I could hear the pain and bullets off the hallway. And I knew we were hit. We were going down. I remember seeing a waterfall as we went down. I remember thinking how beautiful it was and I was glad that the last thing I was gonna see was pretty. And I remember crying. Because I was never gonna see my baby. In memoriam Paul Adams Vietnam Sgt 5th Infantry Division June 1972, MIA Husband, Father, Hero Gone but never forgotten. It can't be. My wife, she's pregnant. She had a son, three months after you were reported missing. He's 33 now with a wife and a baby of his own on the way. I missed it all? It's like I just woke up and... now it's all over. You have a son who is very proud of you. He has all of your medals and he knows everything about you. My wife... is she alright? I'm so sorry. He mentioned that she died a while ago I think. What's his name? My son? Michael. That was my father's name. That's what I wanted. I just can't believe it. I loved my life so much. I was just getting started. Can you... Can you talk to my wife? Can you let me see her? I wish I could. But I can only see spirits who haven't crossed over yet. Cross over where? Into the light. Does my son know how I died? Just that you were reported MIA. Will you... Will you tell him? Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. You asked me to tell you if I got any new information about your father. And? Your father died in a helicopter crash above a place called Lo Valley. I don't know much about the place except it's pretty remote near a waterfall. Maybe you can take that information to the Pentagon and see if they can come up with anything. How do you know this? You should also know that his last moments... he was thinking of you. He was heart broken that he would never see his child. What? How could you know that? Your father came to me for help. I don't understand what you're trying to say. Just tell me... Look the thing is I have a gift. Your father is dead. But his spirit is still here. He just hasn't crossed over yet. And he wants you to know where he is and what happened. I'm so sorry, I'm really not explaining this very well. I guess I didn't realize how transparent I am. There's been this giant hole in my life as long as I can remember. Even now, I feel lost. I never got used to him not being around. It takes somebody like you to see that and take advantage of it? Get out of my house! Look, I think this was your fathers. And I know he'll want you to have it. What kind of person would do this? What kind of scam is this? What's next? Give you a hundred dollars and send him a message for me? You come into my house you dishonor his memory with this con job! Get out! Get! Out! I didn't ask you for anything. I don't want anything from you. Just please call the Pentagon and ask! Must be great having supernatural powers. Not really! Jim? Hope we have some wine. Right here. Did we forget to pay the light bill? No, I have a headache. And I crossed to wires in the basement. Blew circuits. That's why you're a paramedic and not an electrician. What's up? Does it ever seem weird to you that we're both kind of in the death business? What? You know, I used to think in a funny kind of way... I could keep them from you. You know... Lighten your load. Stupid. Hey. What happened? I almost lost another one today. A 55 year old guy just collapsed on the street. You know, he was blue before we even reached him. I worked on this guy 20 minutes. And the only thing I can think the whole time was 'I am not gonna let him get to you. I swear' I felt like I was gonna die myself if this guy died. Did he? No. I brought him back. That's great. Honey, I can not stand both of us being this way. You know, both of us dealing with... who stays, who goes. I got to do something different. You know, someday I'm gonna make a mistake and the next guy... He's not gonna come back. At least he's not gonna come back to me. What are you thinking? I'm thinking about your brother. What he said to me. To you? He died before we even met. And it was a Summer after... He was at our wedding. He was? He's been with you all along. Had to see you settle down. Had to see you happy. What did he say? He talked about falling off the roof and how you held him. - How you talked to him... - I couldn't save him. I was too late. Hey. No one could have saved him. It was just his time. That's all. But he wanted me to tell you something. And he wanted me to wait till you were really ready to throw in the towel. He said, 'The thing about Jim is... He knows how to take all your fear away. People feel it. He makes more of a difference than he knows. ' He wouldn't want you to give up. Look, if there is one thing that I know... It's that what happens to these people and their last moments, it really matters. And you do great work. No matter what. We're in the life business. Death is just a part of it. Hi. Hi. My wife made me call the Pentagon. Given the information that you gave me? They narrowed it down to this place they believed my father was assigned to. In a chopper, in June of 72. They're working with the Vietnamese government to send a search team to see if... they can find anything. Where did you get this information? How did you get this? I told you the truth. And I know it's really hard to believe but I got my information from him. Is this real? I mean... Can you really talk to my father? Ask him if he still has the last lighter I sent to his mother. The one where I told her to put beside a picture of me facing his crib. Your father wants to know if you have the last lighter - he sent to your mother... - Is he here? Yeah, right here with us. Yes, tell him yes. Tell him, he grew up real good. Tell him I'm proud of him. He said you grew up really well. And he's proud of you. Did it hurt? Was he in pain? He doesn't really remember any of it. He just remembers thinking of you and your mother and he misses her... Tell him... / He can hear you. He's right next to me. She... She never forgot about you. She told me storiesabout you every night. Mostly happy ones but sometimes sad ones. She made you alive to me but... just made me miss you more. I mean, did you see me growing up? Tell him, I've been lost. But now I can. I see his wife and I'll see my grandchild. I'll always be close by. Always be watching. He said he was lost but now he can. And he'll always be close by He will always be watching. We'll find you. If I have to go there myself and find you, I will. I'll bring you back, I will. Tell him, he has to go home. Go home to his wife, she needs him. It's all that matters now. When that baby comes into his life. Man, don't miss a second of it. Not one second. Nothing waits for you. That's one thing that he's got to remember. He wants you to go to your wife, she needs you. I don't want to leave. I mean, there's so much I want to know. So many questions. He wants you to... He wants you to know that everything you need is inside of you. And if you get lost, you just... You look at that compass cause it got him home. Tell him, I'll walk with him. He wants to walk with you. Thank you. Dad? Are you there? Oh, man. It's cold. Do you have your keys? I do / You always forget your keys. Okay. Hey, are you sure you don't want me to go with you? Go to work, I'll be fine. You better miss me. I do already. Present arms. Aim. Fire! What do you think of your grandson? It's funny. I look at him... and I feel I can go now. Can I? Feels like it's time. If you're ready, you should... See something. Or someone. Is that what that is? That light? I don't know. You're the only one that kind see it. I do see it. Right over by that tree. What? What do you see? My wife. She's standing right there. She's telling me to come. She looks as beautiful as the day I left.
