She's wrong. We do. I can still see everything, All the bad stuff! The shadows are breaking up! Whatever they are, wherever they live, These shadows are very interested in ghost children. The shadows, they actually want something? Whatever it is, they're scary enough That the book decided to rewrite itself to erase any mention of them. Now I'm going to ask you one last time nicely. Ned, you're going to bring me the book now. If this thing goes off, I would hate to see it take away someone who is very precious to you. It doesn't have to end this way. Yes, it does. It's gone, they're gone! The pages are all gone! No! Eli, hurry! While they're rebuilding your office, Everything you need is right here... Copier, wireless, phone, coffee, and best friend. I have all that stuff at home, You know, minus the best friend part. I know, but you hate working from home, ok? And...and no helping any customers or answering the phone. I mean it. Uh, do you want me to unpack these? No. No! My office is gonna be back to normal soon. Ok? Excuse me. All set here. You know what? It's gonna be just like old times. Ok, let me get a copy of the contract for you. Y-you can just email it to me. Here are the keys. I had the power turned back on for you. We haven't set foot in the place in over 5 years, So I have no idea what shape things are in. Um, would you like to see the appraisals? I trust you. All the antiques came with the house, So whatever you think. You can have it all cleared out by next week? Next week? Um... My husband is already in london, So the sooner I can sell both our houses and join him, the better. Ok. Well, if you need a real estate agent, I can recommend... It's all taken care of. Thanks. Um, we never finished the restoration. It turned out to be too big a job. So be careful. Thanks for the heads-up. Catch you later, mom. See you, Melinda. Mm-hmm. Nope. Not so fast. That was Donna peyton. She's brought an entire house of antiques on consignment. You wanna pick up some extra cash? There's no such thing as extra cash. Great. Get started packing, take some pictures. Oh, and be careful. Hello! Anyone there? Hello? Hello? Ok... Is somebody there? I have a friend who can help you. I'm leaving. Hello. Hello? Hello. Ok, I get it. Chains rattling? Seriously? And then some. I'm sorry you got hurt. I'm fine, but there's a really pissed off ghost in that house. If you could confirm that appointment for me, Wednesday at 2 P.M. , that'd be great. Ok. Thanks. Bye. Oh, my god. What now? Haunted house. Nothing's broken. Delia... This is all I managed to grab before the show started. So there's a lot more? It's like they just left everything Exactly where it was and took off. Or were scared off. Don't come back, Or you'll be dead, too. You said there's a problem? One of my employees was injured yesterday in the house. He's ok, but some strange things were happening, And I just wanted to know why you and your husband Left so abruptly. Oh, it was a money pit... Dry rot, dangerously outdated electrical. So it had nothing to do with the death of your daughter? How did you know about that? I do research on all of my clients, And I found Cassidy's obituary. She was a beautiful little girl. Yes, she was, In so many ways. She was only 8 when she died. Louis-barr syndrome. My husband's a doctor. He told me about it. Must have been awful. We had moved back to Grandview, uh, So she could get treatment at Rockland memorial. We thought this house would be A new beginning for us. So you lived here before? As a child, yeah. It's such a lovely town. Then when I saw that the house was for sale, It all felt like destiny. Destiny? Heh. It's silly, I guess, But when I was a kid, I used to walk home from school, Back when you could do that without becoming an amber alert. Anyway, there was this really sweet old lady who lived there. She always had children playing in the yard. It looked so peaceful, Almost like a storybook cottage. Did anything strange happen when you were living there? Uh... Well, sometimes cass would wake up screaming In the middle of the night, Said there were people in her room, Scary people. And things were Constantly getting broken. I mean, paul and I both thought it was just Cassidy's muscle spasms, but she always blamed it On the other people in the house. I mean, we didn't believe her until... Strange things started happening to you and your husband. Yeah. Violent things... Uh, furniture falling over, Dishes flying off the shelves, Doors slamming... usually around midnight, The same time Cassidy would wake up. 2 weeks after she died, Something pushed my husband down the stairs, And we haven't been back since. Wait. Her ghost was inside the mirror? Yeah. Not for long. It's like she didn't wanna show herself, So she hid in the mirror. Wow. Here, mommy. Let me help. You and daddy work too much. That's sweet. Good man. Wait a minute. So why would she haunt her own parents, Especially so violently? I'm not even sure if it was her. I mean, she told her mother about People in the house, scary people. Apparently she would wake up at midnight screaming. You know, maybe the ghosts were stuck in some kind of loop Living the same experience over and over again. There was noises, furniture moving, Things breaking. Aah! Oh. I'm sorry. Hey, you ok? Aiden, you all right? No, baby. It's ok. It was an accident. No, it wasn't. My arms, They jerked. They moved on their own. That's just called a spasm, ok? Look, um, why don't I read to you while you take your bath, huh? How's that sound, buddy? Ok. What happened? Oh, I...I think Aiden Is empathing Cassidy's illness. It'll be fine once I get her into the light. Um, I failed you. There's nothing on the peyton house. All the original plans and deeds and titles And tax information was lost in a fire at the city archives. Oh. The fire from 6 years ago? Actually, the first fire, 1945. Place has a knack for going up in smoke, I guess. So there's no information about the previous owner? The only thing I could find was a lien That was placed on the house by the irs in 1952 With "unknown" written where the owner's name should be And "deceased" stamped on one of the pages. Anyway, the court put it up for auction about 6 years ago. Donna and her husband were the only ones who made a bid. They lived there for about 18 months, and then they left. And that's all I could find, so... I'm sorry. Hey, you know, um, you wanna have a glass of wine? I mean, we haven't had a chance to talk about... The explosion that almost killed me? Or you? Or Ned? Or the fact that Ned has already been In the emergency room twice this year Because of your ghosts? Delia... what?! I am sorry, Melinda, but this is getting too dangerous. To what, be my friend? Let me ask you something. What happened to Ned yesterday in that house, It sounds like Cassidy was trying to scare him away, right? If it was even Cassidy. I'm not... Well, whoever it was, she said, "stay away, or you will be dead, too." Ghosts are unreliable. You should know that by now. Really? Why don't you tell that to the ghost That warned you that president Bedford was gonna die in my office? Maybe you should start paying attention to them for a change. Look, there is a scared little girl Who's locked in a house with angry, dangerous ghosts. Yes, and this is all the more reason for you not to get involved! Or for you to involve my son. Let this one go, Melinda. Please, let it go. I am begging you. You know I can't do that. Cassidy? If you're here, it's ok. I can help you. Please... Just talk to me. You have to hurry. Cassidy? You don't have to hide from me. Whatever's keeping you here, I... I can help you go into the light. It's safe there. Oh, no. I'm not allowed. Of course you are. Did someone tell you that? We're alone now. Follow me. Cassidy? This hatbox... Is this what you wanted to show me? It's in there, but hurry. Right there, in that wall. Uh... Aah! All right, enough! Whoever you are, just let Cassidy go. Get out. Hurry. Cassidy, who are you afraid of? I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. Cassidy... Cassidy, wait! The ghosts don't want Cassidy to go into the light. They told her she's not allowed to. Did you say, "ghosts," plural? Yeah. I think they're the scary people her mom had been talking about. I felt their presence, and it was angry. Enough to try to kill you with a wheelchair? Apparently. Whoever they are, they're hiding, And if we don't find out some history about that house, we're stuck. This box is impossible. Yeah. I couldn't find anything like it on the internet. Maybe the ghost... s don't want you to open it. Cassidy does. She's asking for our help. Why doesn't she just tell you Why the other ghosts won't let her leave? Mm, because for some reason, she's terrified of them. That makes two of us. This emblem looks familiar. Let me see. It's a raven, as in nevermore. Which is good advice for visiting that house. It was a raven that flew at me. Do you think that means something? Sure. Any guesses? What's all that? Old receipts, all with the same handwriting, All marked "services rendered," All dating back before 1943 with no names. Services rendered? What kind of services? Eh, we'll add that to the list of questions. Photo negatives. Yeah. I couldn't see what was on them. I have a scanner that handles photo negatives. I'm on it. And what about the toys in the attic? And Cassidy's mom said she remembered Seeing children playing in the yard, right? What, you think the ghosts in the house are all kids? Why would they be so violent? I mean, first going after you, then me. Hey. I'm gonna work from home after all. Hey, Ned, can I talk to you, please? Yeah. Sure. I really don't want you involved With this anymore. It's dangerous. Mom, I know you're still freaked out about the explosion, But I promise I can take care of myself. No. I'm serious. I can't just bail on Melinda. How do you know? You never even tried. Just say no this once. Say no. Just let me get one good night's sleep, ok? Yeah, that... that's her. That's the old lady who used to smile and wave at me. I remember feeling sorry for her because of the wheelchair. There's something else I have to tell you. My friends were able to date the film stock, and... These photos were taken in the early 1940s. That's when my father was born, so that can't be the same woman I saw. Actually, it could. I think you were seeing her ghost. Um, since I was a little girl, I've...I've been able to talk with a-and see ghosts. And you still see them? Most kids lose their gift Around the same time they stop believing in magic. I didn't. So Cassidy was seeing ghosts. Apparently you were, too. As a kid, I mean. The house hasn't been occupied since 1952, So I think the children you saw were ghosts And they're still there. All those nights, she was so terrified, And we didn't believe her, just told her to go back to bed. Oh, she must have felt so alone. You couldn't have known. And I'm afraid that there's more. I've talked to Cassidy, And she's still there. What? She...she is? Did she die there? No. No, the hospital. Ok. Well, then something brought her back, And it must be that woman. Wait. Are you telling me my... my little girl Is trapped there by that old lady, But why? Who...who was she? We don't know. All we have is the last name hanson. You can see it Right there on the mail slot. I...I don't... I don't understand. Spirits are supposed to go into the light, But for some reason, in this house, They don't want your daughter to cross over. Are they, um... are they hurting her? Is that even possible? There's still a lot to figure out. But whatever it is, I will bring her peace. I promise. Mm. Mm! That's defense. Huh? Right? Hmm. Heh. Hello. Hey. How'd it go with Donna? She believe you? I had pretty convincing evidence. Hey, what you got there, baby? You left it on the table. Am I in trouble? No. Of course not. It looks like You made more progress than anybody. It's pretty cool. And remember, don't call me baby anymore. Oh, right. I'm sorry. So Delia moved her stuff out of the store today, Said she'd rather work from home. Ah. Think she's still pretty rattled, huh? Yeah. I can't say that I blame her. Wha... You ok, man? What's going on? My arms again. You know what? I-it's just Cassidy, ok? It's gonna be over soon, I promise. Um, do you want some cocoa? Yeah, pal. Why don't I make it? Ok. Come on. Mel. Hey, what's going on? What's wrong? I just saw people being murdered. The other ghosts in the house, right? I think those were locks of their hair. Why would that lady keep them hidden in her house? Because she doesn't want anybody to know. Look, didn't Cassidy warn you That if you didn't stay away from there, you'd be dead, too? Yeah, but she's the one who just showed me those. It's like she's warning me again. About the old woman? Maybe those are souvenirs from other ghosts. Maybe she murderred them all. Cassidy. Cassidy, I know about the other ghosts. If they're keeping you here, I can help you. What is this? Did you bring the tribute? Thank you. And the embodiment? Excellent. I already sense her. Now place your hands flat On the table in front of you. Mine will stay constrained Throughout the session To prove there's no trickery. Let us begin. Denizens of the spirit world... Your loved ones call you tonight Not to disturb you from your troubled sleep, But to help you find peace. Tonight we call Naomi, Beloved daughter Of Virgil and Esther. A seance. Are you kidding me? Naomi, will you come to us? Are you Naomi? They killed me. Naomi, will you give us a sign that you're with us? They killed me! No. No, you're upsetting her. Naomi is with us now. She wants you to know her death came quickly. Stop! You're lying! She's gone! She says she loves you. She's going into the light now. Stop it! She lied to us And our families. There was never any light. Dream? That old woman was pretending to be a medium when she was alive. I was a ghost at one of her seances, if you can believe that. Ok, her name is Greta hanson, also known as madame Greta. She set up shop in Grandview in 1924 During the whole spiritualism revival. She died in 1943 when her wheelchair rolled down the stairs. More likely a ghost pushed her. Where'd you get this? I spent hours searching "hanson" plus "spiritualism" And "medium" and "seance" And found exactly nothing. Professor grant gave me the t.A. Job. I now have full access to the copeland wing at the library. I hate you. Madame Greta operated under the radar, Held her sessions in a secret room, Worked strictly by private referral, and made a killing, So to speak. Yeah, off the suffering Of grieving people and frustrated ghosts. She must have been pretty convincing. Harry houdini even attended one of her seances, But never publicly debunked her. Yeah, probably because, according to Melinda, She was able to attract ghosts, But she just couldn't actually communicate with them. So the murder visions that Melinda had, Could the old woman have been a medium and a serial killer? You know, so she'd always have fresh ghosts to contact? Maybe not. Melinda said a man at the seance brought a lock of hair. As an embodiment. Mediums sometimes asked For something personal from the deceased. And the ghost in Melinda's dream said, "they killed me." Yeah. Mel said she looked like she'd been strangled. So maybe madame Greta specialized in contacting murder victims. Ok, so the ghosts aren't kids after all, But what happened to the children that Cassidy's mom saw? And why is Cassidy stuck In a house with a bunch of murdered people? Ahh. You're giving me a headache. Sounds like a good time to go and chat with some ghosts. A field trip to the house of whacked spirits At the witching hour? Thank you, no. Besides, your mom said ghosts are off limits. I know, but since I can't talk to them anyhow A-and I know you're not gonna let Melinda go alone... Ok. I'll call her. Jim finally got Aiden to sleep, So we should get going. Do we even have a plan? Yeah. Our first priority is to get her out of that house And convince her to cross over into the light. But we don't even know what we're up against. We have madame Greta, murder victims. Who knows how many? And if they're all just trying to keep Cassidy there... Trust me. When she sees her mommy, she's gonna come to us. Let's go. I told you to stay away. Cassidy? Cassidy, you're here. Look. Let me call your mommy. I have to go. I'll get in trouble for talking to you. From who? Who are you afraid of? Them. She's looking for her. She's angry. Who, madame Greta? Who are you? What is it, chains? What's going on? You were both in prison. She's coming. Cassidy, hurry. No, no! Wait! They're gone. You said they were prisoners? Yeah. And they both had burns and lacerations, Like they'd been executed. You know, the visions I had of...of murders, Maybe it wasn't from the victim. What if I was seeing it all through the killer's eyes? Wait a minute. Are you saying all the other ghosts in the house are murderers? The ghosts of murderers? And they're keeping Cassidy trapped in that house? I don't know if they are murderers. I mean, we ided them by the numbers on their uniform. They were convicted in the twenties, executed in the thirties, And since then, they'd been proven innocent. You saw people being killed, didn't you? I know. Which means that they're not the only ghosts in that house. I mean, Ned told me that madame Greta's brother Was hanged for murder. She went into spiritualism To try to prove that he was innocent, And it became her specialty as a medium. She didn't even have the gift. All she did was attract hundreds of ghosts to that house, Murderers and people who were wrongfully executed. Wait. So the innocent ones are still there. Where are the guilty ones? Hiding from me, or maybe they went into the light. And the innocent ones didn't. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Yeah, it doesn't make any sense, But there's gotta be some kind of good reason. Yeah. Oh, wait. You know, executions are usually scheduled at midnight. That might have something to do with the timing of your hauntings. Yeah, but not why they won't let Cassidy cross over. I'll be right back. All right. Hey. You can't help her. I don't believe that. The two of you who appeared to me, You were innocent, weren't you? Why didn't you go into the light? We won't leave Cassidy. We can't. You're protecting her? And you. From what? The ghosts? The ones who were guilty? Yes, but they aren't ghosts anymore. Wh-what are you... There, my sweet. Soon you can come play with all the lovely toys at my house forever. You and my friend Cassidy here will have such fun. You'll see. Are you home? No. I'm in Eli's office doing a little research. Is it econ, or are you still helping out Melinda? Mom, this one's huge. Melinda needs all the help she can get. Ned, we talked about this. I know, but this is amazing. This house is full of ghosts, and for some reason, They won't let this poor little girl go into the light. Listen, it is great that you care about her And that you found something that you're passionate about, but, Ned, Listen to me. A ghost kidnapped Aiden. Another one killed president Bedford. You have been hurt twice. When are you gonna understand This is too dangerous? Apparently more dangerous than even Melinda realizes. What? Mom, I gotta go. I'll call you from the car and explain. No, no, no... Ned. Ned, hold... Hello? Aiden, it's way past your... Bedtime. Aiden. I know where your boy is all the time. Do you? Don't you dare threaten my son. They stay out of my business. Ned, hey. Tell us what's going on. I found out what the raven means, The one on the puzzle box. Ok, in the "book of changes"? First I asked professor grant about it. She said that an emblem like this On a tombstone represents A guardian of the soul. What's that have to do with the book? I'll show you. The book must have erased it. Doesn't it only do that when it's worried about the shadows? Yeah, and if it has something to do with the shadows, That explains a few things. One of the prisoners told me that the other convicts Are in the house, but they're not ghosts anymore. But how could they be there and not be ghosts? If they change into shadows. All right, help me out. It's what the shinies told Aiden... Or what he saw happening to Julia. Right. Shadows, they prey on your guilt. They break your spirit apart, And they feed on the pieces. You know, I think I've seen something like this before, But I just didn't know what it was, These dark, angry ghosts that don't really cross over. They more cross under. Maybe that's the shadows. Maybe that's how they multiply. Yeah, and these are just Especially interested in children. But if shadows exploit your guilt, Why are they so caught up on Cassidy? What does she have to be so guilty about? I don't know. Maybe nothing. Maybe that's why she's still here. Jim, help me pack up everything shiny. And don't let Aiden out of your sight, ok? Ok. And can you call Eli? I'll meet you guys at the house. I'm gonna call Cassidy's mom on the way. Melinda, be careful. Yeah. What's going on? Is Cassidy here? I need you to talk to her, Tell her that it's safe to come outside. We don't have a lot of time. Cass-Cassidy. Sweetie. You could come out. It's ok. Please? Mommy. Mommy, you shouldn't be here. It's ok. All right? We're safe for now. Look, she's here. I'll explain later, But we have to hurry. I...I wish I could see her one last time. Don't be sad, mommy. She doesn't want you to be sad. How could I not be? If we had just listened to her When she told us about the scary people, We would have left this house sooner. Will you...will you tell her that? She can hear you. Can you ever forgive us? I was never mad at you. She was never angry with you. Look, Cassidy, I have to ask you something. Madame Greta, she brings children here for a reason, doesn't she? It's ok. You can tell the truth. She isn't here. But she said if I told anyone, I'd be punished. She can't hurt you. All right? And the other ghosts, the lady and the man, They were protecting you, weren't they? We protect each other Whenever the cold things come. The shadows. Yeah. I felt that cold before. So how do you protect each other? We make a circle so they'll go away, But they always come back, And they're getting stronger. So that's why you didn't wanna leave? Because you were afraid that the cold things would take your friends away? Like they did to the others, All of them. The children, too? Look, it's not safe for you to be here, ok? Do you see a light? No. What is it? Does she see the light? No. Please, just tell her that it's ok. Tell her to see the light. You can go with her. Both of you. Cassidy, you've helped us stay safe for so long. Now you have to help yourself. Ok? That's pretty. My friends can come, too? Really? She sees the light. Look, all of you just go. Ok? It's where you belong, And you're gonna be safe there, I...I promise. I love you, mommy. She says she loves you. Cassidy! No! Sorry. We got here as fast as we could. Did Cassidy cross over? No. What? Madame Greta stopped her, And I think she's just getting warmed up. Cassidy? What is it? What's going on? It's ok. I'll explain later. Ned, put all these things by the windows. Eli, open the blinds. They don't like light. Hurry up, and whatever you do, do not turn these things off. Can count on that. Open the ones in front, too. I'm on it. Cassidy, it's ok for you to come back. Cassidy. Cassidy. You said we could go. You promised. Look, do you see the light? Is it still open? Yes, but I'm scared. There's nothing for you to be scared of. You just go, ok? It's gonna be fine. Tell her. Cassidy! I-it's ok. Do what Melinda says. It's too late! They're here, And they're angry with you. Get out while you can. No. I am not leaving until you guys go into the light. Oh, boy. Just stay here. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong. We did nothing wrong... The child stays with me. No. No. All you've been doing is using her To lure other ghosts here. That's over. Cassidy's too naughty to go into the light. She tricked all those other little ghosts. We, we! That's a lie. Don't listen to her! Cassidy, she's just saying that To make you feel bad for something you didn't do. She couldn't stand being alone, So she lied to those other ghosts so she could have friends. That's why the light's not for her. She doesn't deserve it. I don't? No, Cassidy, don't listen to her. Listen to your friends. You did nothing wrong. You did nothing wrong. You did nothing wrong. You did nothing wrong. You did nothing wrong. We need more shiny stuff. There's silver everywhere. Grab it and spread it around. Look! The shadows, they blocked us in! Move it! Hurry! It won't budge! You did nothing wrong. Cassidy, you didn't do anything wrong. Don't you understand? That's why the shadows haven't taken you, because you're innocent. Stop interfering. Get out of my house! Now! The shadows are killing the lights, even the headlights! You know what? The only one guilty here is you. Ok, you took advantage of people when you were alive, But you were lying, And all you were doing Was bringing tortured souls back to the shadows. That's enough. Now you're feeding them children Because it's either them or you. Be quiet! What? What is that? The headlights, they're coming back on. Cassidy, go! Go right now! Tell mommy and daddy I love them! I promise! Go! Run, Cassidy! Cassidy! No! I'll find more for you, hundreds of them! All the children you need! Just, please, I beg you! Oh, no! Oh, no! Help me move this stuff. Ned, Melinda! Oh, my god. Are you ok? Delia! I am now. Wait. So Greta had some kind of deal with the shadows? She fed them ghosts, and they didn't feed on her? Apparently. There's only one thing I don't understand. What got into you? Showing up all Nick of time, Like, heroic and stuff? Please. I'm no hero. Somebody's gotta look after you guys. The trouble is my lunatic son is a hero, So what am I supposed to do? Be a hero, too. Ok, maybe just this once. But don't get used to it. Real estate is my business. This heroing... Ned learned everything from you. Would you promise just to be careful, for god's sake? Right, kid. Listen to your mother, all right? And you, too. What's wrong? I just wish we knew what was so
