And I'm not going anywhere. You have to cross over. I don't want to. Jim, no. - You're back. - Do I know you? Look, I see the same guy that you see, different hair, nose, eyes.It's not Jim. I just know what I see when I look in those eyes. And Jim, he's in there somewhere.He just has to be. It's not much, but maybe you could help me finish my garage. And you could live there while you do the work. Just until you figure out your next move. Will you tell me what's going on between us. Do you know how lucky you are? You're going to get a second shot at your one true love. I bought that less than a month ago. Question is who did I buy it for? Phones are finally turned on. And I checked the faucets,and the water's running. Almost got lost on my back way here, this place is huge. So is the commission if I land a sale. These people must be loaded, I can't believe they just left all this. I know it happened sometimes. So what if the new owners don't like their stuff? I guess we auction it off for charity. Can I bit a dollar on the Xbox in the den? No.But you can help me take all the pictures off the wall. - Is this them? The Bancrofts.  - Yeah. They left their pictures, too? That's why we're packing all these up. Because I'm sure they're gonna want some of these. The walls are going to look pretty blank. Well, you know, buyers like to picture themselves in a house. That's why Melinda is going to get some prints to fill everything up. That reminds me.I have got to go.Pick her up. I need you to do me a favor. Cut the grass. The lawn-mower is outside back in the shed, ok? People normally charge for that, you know? Well...how does free room and board sound? Fine. I'm gonna take off for now. But I'm just gonna be gone for about an hour. Come on, come on, Come on, hurry. 911, what is your emergency? Can you verify the location for me? Sir, I need you to apply pressure to the wound. Everything will be ok. Help is on the way. 911, what is your emergency? We need help! Please send an ambulance. I've got your location, sir. 4225 Avalon Circle, is that correct? He's bleeding, it's really bad... God! Ok, I'm dispatching an ambulance right now. Can you tell me, is the victim conscious? Yes, It rolled over him, the lawn mower, he's... Sir, can you tell me if he is breathing? He's all cut up! 4225 Avalon Circle ... Please! You'll see the staging is basically done for us. None of the things seems the least big strange to you? They left all their family photos behind. I mean, who does that? As long as the commission check clears, I don't really care. Is this the house you're selling? Where is Ned? What happened? We got a call about an accident-kid hurt by a lawn- mower. My God! Ned! Ned, Ned! And you do not have the keys to the house? No, just the shed. No, just the shed. I swear I didn't make that call. Ned! Are you ok?! I'm fine. I don't know what they're talking about. Hey, Bobby, What's going on? - Melinda, How are you?  - I'm ok. We got a 9-1-1 call from this address. It wasn't me. Could anyone else have used the phone? This is my listing, nobody else has the key. What about the sellers? No, We changed the lock. Your son said he didn't see anyone go in. I was out here mowing the lawn, So maybe I just didn't notice. What was the emergency? Caller said someone got badly cut by the blades of a lawnmower. I looked around. There's no one else in there. Must have been a prank. Yeah, it wasn't a prank. Somebody did need help, They just didn't get to him in time. That's him. That's the boy that I saw in the yard. That's the Bancroft's youngest son Josh. Well, It's a good bet he died at the house, then. No, I just went over all the sales paperwork, and the Bancrofts never disclosed a death on their property. Well, It's not exactly a well-kept secret. Listen to this article from 2 years ago- "14 year old Josh Bancroft "died in an accident at his family's home "riding a lawnmower. Severe lacerations, Paramedics were unable to revive him." That is horrible. I can't even imagine it. But why would the boy still be there? Well, Bobby was sure that the call was made from the house phone, And the kid seemed fixated on the paramedics. I think the ghost called 9-1-1. A ghost that uses the telephone? Those calls are recorded in some sort of databank, and ghosts manipulate electronics all the time. I just had that line turned on yesterday. So maybe when Ned fired up that mower, It provoked the ghost. And what, he's calling for help? well, he might not realize it's too late. Someone needs to tell him that he's dead and it's time to move on. Well, Could you? I have an open house in just a few days, and the market is tough enough as it is. Yes, I'll get right on it, just as soon- Who's he talking to? This is going to drive me nuts. What? He's trying to figure out Who he bought that engagement ring for. I mean,He could be talking to her right now! Who,  he fiancee? She is not his fiancee until he puts a ring on her finger. It's ok, honey, Just breathe. I know that he just wants to find her and tell her that he didn't fall off the face of the earth. That's right. There's really nothing to worry about. He's just trying to make peace with his past. Yeah, but his past isn't Sam's. He's Jim. I'm his past. Bye, Delia. I know. It's been too long. Yeah, me, too. I promise you're going to hear a lot more from me from now on. and Jordan, you know, please tell mom and dad I said bye, ok? Thanks. hi. Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear. How's your sister? Jordan's great, you know? Things between her and my parents are really good now. Great. So did she ever get you any answers? You know, about the ring? Are you still trying to figure out who you bought it for? no. Jordan put a lot of things together for me. Well, Great. So... Can I ask you a question? When you met your husband Jim, Did you know right away? I mean, Could you tell he was the one? Yes. Jordan says it wasn't like that at all with me and Nicole. - She's my   - Girlfriend. Right. She said it was 8 years of on again, off again, on again until I finally got the ultimatum, Let's get married or get out of here. So by the looks of my new zip code, I chose door number 2. But even though you moved here, you bought a ring. Yeah, Which I then stowed in a safety deposit box. So... It looks like I flaked on her again. Yeah, or maybe, maybe- Maybe you just hadn't decided yet. Too many maybes, huh? See you later. Hey, Can you hand me the runner for the centerpiece? So you haven't met the family yet? No, just their lawyers, who threatened to fire me When I asked why their son's death wasn't on the disclosure form. Well, I'm sure they'd rather get sued then have someone ask them about it. But you know, even the best lawyers can't stop neighborhood gossip. Is he here? No. No, Speak freely. Ok. Well, Another realtor in my office Said that she heard that Mr. Bancroft was driving the mower when his son died. No wonder they left everything. Yeah, everything but their memories. You know, It's just so sad. The whole family falls apart, the parents get a divorce, and then their son moves hundreds of miles away to go to Strathmore university. Do you hear that? What? We had a good idea it was a prank When we got the same call from the same house. Well, Do you know who placed the call? Was it a woman or a man? Dispatch said it was an adult male. What's weird is, his side of the call was exactly the same. No matter what he was asked, he used the same words as the call yesterday, verbatim. What the hell is going on here? I - I don't know. I put a call into the phone company, and I'm hoping they might have some answers. We can send more patrol over to help you watch the house. - Whatever you can do to help. - Ok. Josh, I'm sorry. It's-It's too late. They can't save you, you're already dead. Why are you here? To help you, Cause I know that you're confused. You're the one who's confused. Josh... Your family moved on. You should, too. No. That's wrong. They're running away, but they can't escape. They're running away, but they can't escape... What does that mean? I don't know, I think maybe he wants them to come home? I mean, they split up after he died, So maybe he thinks showing his presence in that way will get them back together again. Yeah, but that's a tall order. The lawyer says he can't even get the parents in the same room together. And what about those phone calls, anyway? Bobby said that it was a man. I think he's resending his original 9-1-1 calls from the accident, And the caller, it had to have been his father. Can you imagine the guilt? - So what happens now? - I don't know. But I won't know what we're up against until I get to know the family better. Hi, Mrs. Bancroft, I have a delivery for you. Well, please, come on in. Thank you. My name is Melinda Gordon. I'm friends with Delia, who's selling your grandview house, And I've been helping her stage it. Anyway, when I saw this, um, I thought that you would want it. Thank you for coming all the way out here, But, uh, no, I don't, actually... want this. Would you tell your friend that I don't want anything from that house? Ok, Well, I'm sorry for the confusion. I guess your style here is different. It's lovely. Thank you. I just needed a change. A fresh start. I've been feeling the same way recently. I just lost my husband, so... Oh, I'm sorry. So am I. About your son. How did you get through it? I just... knew he'd be with me. Wherever I went. And... He is. What about you? Do you feel like... Here that your son is with you? Well, he's in my heart always. But I didn't move to escape the memory of my son. My older son, he's in college, And my husband and I are... divorced, and... I did try not to blame him. But I just, I couldn't help it. Do you know we had the same argument about parenting for 20 years? Doug thought that I was too strict, and I thought that he was too lenient, And... And I was gone for an hour. For one hour. Well, you can't blame yourself. Oh, I don't. I blame Doug. He is the reason that my son is dead. I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee. See ya. Ok, I'll see you later. - Hi, Sam.  - Ned, how is it going? Good, just here to do some statistics homework. - You?   - Statistics? Brutal. Wait a minute. Can you help me? I'm trying to get into my E-mail but I forgot my password When I guess when I forgot everything else in my life. What have you tried? My birthday, my Alma Mater, my family dog's name, Every scrap of information anyone's ever given me. You might have allowed your browser to save your passwords, Especially if you are working behind a firewall. That sounds dangerous. All right.Here is your password file. Let's just hope it's not encrypted. - You are in luck.  - No kidding. - Thanks Ned. - FYI ... - Your password is "password".  - Yeah. Work, more work. Spam, a lot spam. And apparently I am really bad at fantasy football. - Looking for something specific?  - I do not know. I guess I'm looking for somebody to tell me what I was looking for. Hey, black coffee, please. Maybe I could tell me what I was looking for. Yeah, that's great, thank you. "Nicole, I know you're mad, but this time is different " "I bought the ring, I am ready" "I love you, Sam." - Who is Nicole72?  - I do not remember. But it looks like that it was ready to marry her. If the ghost wants his family to be together again, It's getting be waiting a long time. - Yep, but it was an accident.  - Not in her mind. I mean, She blames the father completely. It was like the last in a series of very irresponsible moves. Maybe just a inch that way. You know, well, if Josh felt the same way, Maybe that's what he meant when he said they were running away. Maybe he thinks his father's running away is from his guilt. Yes, or maybe not. He came. I guess I did not realize that we'd left so much behind. Melinda has been helping me style the house. She spoke with your wife to see if she wanted to keep any of the collectables. - Is there anything you'd like to keep?  - You saw Elena ... How is she? She seemed eager to sell the house. Well, I'm gonna be sorry to see it go. Even with everything that happened, we were a family. We were happy here. I'm so sorry. I know that you lost your son here. I still feel him aound me. - Is that crazy?  - No. If you could ... talk to him. What would you say? Do you have any idea how he died? There was so much blood ... You just can't believe that there's that much blood inside anyone. Josh had watched me teach Devin to drive. Like any kid brother,he was jealous as hell. Come on Dad, I wanna try it. I figured what would it hurt him to give him a chance to steer. So I let him sit with me. I thought it was safe. It was a bad call. We lost control. Josh! Josh! And I lost Josh. Josh! Josh! God! God! My boy, my boy, my boy! I would give anything to take him back, anything. Liar. Excuse me. Hello? 911, what is your emergency? We need help! Please send an ambulance! We need help! Please! What's going on? We need help! Please! It is the same 911 call. Why is this happening?  Why won't it stop? Please stop this. In Avalon Circle, please! These phone calls you've received them before, since when? For a couple of days, Why won't they stop? You are hurting him ... Why are you doing this? He knows why. Wait a minute, who were you talking to? What's going on here? This has gonna stop. - Hello?  - Hey, Bobby, It's Melinda. Listen, are you on your way to the Bancroft's house? - Yeah, I am.  - Yeah, I know it. I just want to tell you it's a false alarm. Thanks for the head's up, But we're headed in that direction,anyway. One of the neighbors went out to get her mail comes back in with palpitations. - Why? What happened?  - You're at the house, right? - Yeah.  - 4227 Avalon Circle? Take a look at the lawn. Help me - Help me.  - Yes, help me. As if the 911 calls weren't enough. He seared his plea into the neighbor's lawn. No, I understood that part, I mean help me,it's my only tie. Sorry. Well, it's interesting to see that the ghosts is branching out in the new media. Yeah, but why? I mean is he worried that this phone call is going unheard? They sure got his father's attention. Has the ghost tried to call anyone else? Mr. Bancroft said he has not heard from his son on the subject. - How about the mum?  - I do not think so. I gave her plenty of chances to talk about£¬ Bumps in the night,she didn't take the bait. So it seems like the ghost has a beef with the old man. But why? I mean to make Mr. Bancroft feel... even more guilty for causing his death? I mean, the guy is so guilt-ridden already, What's the point? "Help me" Blot, don't rub. No, this time makes me mulling the concept. Maybe it is not about blame, Maybe the ghost is asking for something. And we're just not getting it? I mean, he does keep sending the phone call, Maybe there's something we're not hearing. You were right, calls we've been getting was a recording of an original call back in 2006. I got this copy from a buddy at dispatch. - How did you know about the accident?  - I know the family. It's a shame. Do you have any idea where these calls are coming from? - No.  - Do you? I'm just trying to help the family. 911, what is your emergency? We need help! Send an ambulance! Can you can tell me what happened, sir? Yeah, It's rolled over him, the lawn mower. He's all cut off. Can you verify the location for me? Yes, 4225 Avalon Circle. Please! The ambulance is on its way. I need you to check that the victim is breathing. Can you do that? I don't know! He's bleeding! It's really bad! God! Please! Could you please hurry up? Well hang on .The other one's cued up as well. The other one? Came in a couple of minutes before this one, From a different number. - 911, what is your emergency?  - No, no, no, no! Was that Josh's father again? It is not uncommon for people to reach for a backup during an emergency. So then why did he hang up? Lost reception, had to help his son, I do not know. Can I keep that? If it gives you any leads on who's been sending them, let me know. Thank you. I hate to bring this up, But I have a buyer who wants to come to see the house, So I was just wondering what the next move was with the occupant. - I really don't have one.  - Really? Delia, you're at the house right now,aren't you? Fine, OK.I'll meet you there. No, no, no, I'm fine. I just forgot some papers here. Besides, you're the one who always say that ghosts can't really hurt people. - Right?  - Right. Do they break windows? I'm already looking for my car keys. No, no, no, I'll just have Sam come and fix it. Besides, it is probably just the ghost, or whatever. Just got a little annoyed and probably tousled things around a bit,right? All he's done so far has been a cry for help, Just wait on me, okay? Seriously, I will be there in 10 minutes. No, It's ok,don't worry. It's a big deal, make me feel better. Hey! Did you go inside? I said to wait. It's fine up here, Okay. - God!  - Delia? - Great, the electricity is out.  - What? That was probably just knocked out by the storm. I mean,that can happen,right? Ok, well,I'm just gonna get my paperwork and get the hell out of here. OK, but I'm staying on the phone until you do, Hurry up! - My God!  - What, what? What is it? - I see something.  - What? Delia? Hey, if you see something,get out of there! You can not see ghosts! Josh? Delia! Delia? Where are you? What happened? Where did you? Delia? Delia, please! - Delia?  - I'm sorry, I'm fine. The phone just got knocked out of me. What happened? The table got knocked over, only it wasn't a ghost, it was a guy. A guy? inside the house? Look, Delia, get out of there. Ok? I'm gonna call the cops. No,no. I think it's ok. I think I know who it is. I'm gonna call you back, ok? Devin! Is that you? It's ok, honey. I just want to help you. - The one is there!  - Get down! On the ground! get on the ground now! Hands behind your back! - Wait, wait, stop!  - Down! Oh, please don't hurt him! I think he's the Bancroft's son! Take a step back, ma'am. Take a step back. ok. You have the right to remain silent. You give up that right, anything you say can and will be Used against you in a court of law. You have a right to have an attorney present Both before and during any questioning. Apparently they didn't care that it was his house. They brought him in on trespassing, breaking and entering, And now they're questioning him about the vandalism. - It's the burned lawn.  - Yes. He's taking the blame for somebody else's handiwork. Well, maybe we were right. Maybe Josh is getting exactly what he wanted- His family back at the house one by one. Well, that was fast. Delia. Look, I'm so sorry if my son gave you a scare. Yeah, everything ok? It's just crazy they're even charging him. Our lawyers will get that straightened out. He was just back on a visit, decided to crash at the old house. Isn't that right, Devin? Anyway, we didn't know, and apparently, The lines got crossed somehow. Yeah, that seems to be happening a lot lately. Why did you go home now? Did you get a call, too? No, he was homesick.It happens. Yeah, you got a 911 call. Your brother sent them to both of you. How could she ...? Who are you? All right, Devin. Not now okay? Look, I need to get my son home. Now, I imagine that you're here to give your statement, And I'm sure that you're going to explain to the police About the whole misunderstanding. This is what always happens. Dad makes things go away. I've been through every email in my inbox.. Nothing from Nicole. Can't say I blame her. What kind of schmoe asks someone to marry them in an email? Wait, so you think that's why she didn't respond? No, she responded. Women don't not respond to marriage proposals. Of course, the answer can vary From a giddy yes to a resounding no Or maybe .If you're willing to work on your narcissism And latent mommy issues. She was a colleague. It really didn't work out. Look, if she did reply, Then why can't I find the email? Just because you lacked any sense of romance doesn't mean she did. Maybe she wrote you a letter. No, no. I've been through all my stuff. There's nothing. How about a voicemail? Have you checked your phone? No. I don't know the password, So I can't access the account. Can't? or don't want to? Why would I not want to? Because if she said yes, You're engaged to somebody you don't even know. And if the answer's no, you were rejected by the one person Who could tell you who you were. - You are a talented shrink.  - Thanks. I'm not gonna tell you what to do, but just so you know, It only takes a social security number for the phone company to let you access your messages. So did she send him a voicemail? I left it up to him, so I don't know. And even if I did, I couldn't tell you. You have to have gotten some idea what he was gonna do. Fine. 911, what's your emergency? Is that the 911 call? Yeah, I just don't know why he's using tape calls instead of talking to me. Well, he's been communicating with the brother and dad same way, too. Yeah, the two people who were there when he died. What message is he sending? You're not gonna believe this. I just came from the house. The cop's searched it, and they found Devin's bag pack with a big box of weedkiller in it. Wait, he trashed the lawn? Not the ghost? Apparently. The detective told me that he's having trouble in school, that he was on the verge of being kicked out. And then 3 days ago, He just bailed. That's the same day that the house phone was hooked up. So he must started getting phone calls and came straight here. Crying out for help. Just like his dead brother's doing it on his behalf. That's it. It's gotta be the first 911 call. 911, what's your emergency? No, no, no, no, no, no! Did you hear that? His voice got louder. Yeah, like he was going towards the phone. So Mr. Bancroft isn't the one who made that call. Devin was the one calling for help. It sounds like the old man was trying to stop him. Why would he do that? Something Devin did. Something that a father wouldn't want his son to get blamed for. Mr. Bancroft, hi, it's Melinda Gordon. It's really important that we talk. It's about your son, Devin. Please call back. Okay? - Hello?  - Hey, Mel, I'm Bobby. Please tell me not another 911 call. This time a call from a neighbor. Said they saw a kid jumped off the roof. Devin! Please, please .Please, please. Help! Somebody help us! Call 911! They're on their way, a neighbor called. Melinda, I need you to listen carefully. I've reduced the shoulder dislocation, but he needs to be immobilized. Can you go in the house and bring me a blanket and two towels? And a lot of magazines. Magazines? The thicker, the better. I have to build a splint. The arm might be broken. - Melinda, quickly, please.  - All right! You gotta be still, you could still damage the nerves in your arms. You're gonna be okay. Don't move. You'll be all right. My name is Sam. You'll be all right. He was lucky you were here. Yeah, I guess so. Where'd you learn to make field splints? Guess I just see stuffs on TV. So how is that feel? He needed help, I helped him. How did it feel to remember? I mean, that stuff had to come from some place. I know I was an architect. Why would I know about emergency medicine? I know that you feel strange, but it's progress. I mean, you have to believe that it's all gonna come back now, right? It was an accident. He fell. What was he doing up there? What was he even doing at the house? And vandalizing other people's lawns? Doug, he needs help. Can you see that? Someone has seen it. Someone who loves you very much. Your brother. I'm sorry, Ms. Gordon. Isn't it? This really is not a good time for visitors. Yeah, I couldn't disagree more. Josh's been waiting to see you all together. It's something he's been wanting for quite some time. If there's anything you want to say, Josh, this is your chance. Tell them to stop fighting. Please, not now. Okay? Josh ... Tell them to count to 3 fingers. He wants you to count to 3 fingers. Well, that's what Uncle Chip said whenever he got on fight with Aunt Pansy. You know,3 fingers? How much liquor to put in your drink. It's what Uncle Chip would say to Aunt Pansy. Oh. My God. And, and he's really still here? Josh! What is he saying? Why can they just talk? Why can't they just say what they're feeling? He wished you guys could just talk. It's been really hard for him watching his whole family fall apart. Over a lie. What? What lie? Josh, if you're really here, then I know you'll want what is best for us, for all of us. Dad, stop it! You're not helping! It was too late to help me then, and I know you were trying, but you're not helping! You're not! It was me. What? That accident. It wasn't dad's fault, mom. It was mine. Dad wasn't even there. Dad was inside, working. The driving lesson was over. Josh was begging for a dirt riding, so I let him sit with me. Come on! Go faster! - No! - Come on, Dev. Let me steer. Then he wanted to steer, and I kept telling him no, but ... I won't listen. So I grabbed the wheel. - Stop!  - Devin, let me steer! - Josh  - Come on! No! Josh! Josh! Josh! Dad heard the screams,and he came out and found us. - 911, what's your emergency?  - No! No, no, no, no, no, no! He grabbed my phone when I called 911. Josh... Then called himself. Made me promise to say I was inside studying. Why? Why did you lie to me? Because I thought... You'd already lost one child. You don't want me to... lose the other? Because you thought that I couldn't forgive him. You didn't give her a chance. And ever since that, The lie, it's been killing me, Dad. - I know what I did was... - Devin It was a mistake. A stupid mistake. But lying to mom about it made me feel... Unforgivable. But I'm the one who should be mad at. Not Devin, not Dad. It was my mistake. Josh feels like it was his fault. Josh, no! It was! And it racked everything. You guys are all apart now because of me. He feels like he destroyed your family. Josh. It was nobody's fault. And I love you. Both of you. Even if I ... Even if I have to go away? He wants to know if you will still love him even if he has to go away Yes. Even if you'd leave us. I saw that once before. Is that for me? But I don't want them to be alone. He doesn't want you all to be alone. We're not alone. Because we have each other. And we will always be a family. No matter what. He's gone. All right.It's less than the asking price, but it's an offer, and they obviously love the place, because it's their third time coming back. Third time? You own there. They are hooked. Listen, if I make the sale, I want you to celebrate with me at the SPA. It is my treat. I totally owe you one. It's a deal. And speaking of coming back, Has there been any memory breakthrough for Sam? I'm not sure, but you know what? I just feel like Jim is in there somewhere, waiting to come out. And now is the perfect time to find out. I want details. Call me later, bye. Sam! Sam? Oh, hey. Hi, Melinda. - Hey...here. - Thanks. Seems like you have a lot of new mind lately. Yeah. I mean it's just a lot of stuff that doesn't fit. Shoulder pain, weird violent memories and the inexplicable medical knowledge. But you know what I'm going to do what you told me. I'm gonna find somebody who understands me. Well, that's great. I mean, Eli said that he wanted you to try the past life regression therapy. So... I think I'm gonna talk to somebody who ... actually knows where the stuff is coming from. Like? Nicole. I mean I was with her for almost a decade. So... You know,who would know me better? That's a good question. Yeah, so I'm gonna go to Raleigh. Thanks. So that's what all this is for? Yeah.
