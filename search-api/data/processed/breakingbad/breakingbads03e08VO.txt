You had my wife's name! You're suspended. Hand over your badge and your gun. Pinkman isn't pressing charges. Two men are coming to kill you. You have one minute.</i> You'll be okay waiting here by yourself? Whatever. Sir, if you'd like to smoke, you need to be another 20 feet from the door. So roll me further, bitch. - What's coming? - Male Caucasian. Early 40s. Multiple gunshot wounds. BP is 70. 7-0 over palp. Pulse 140... 1-4-0. Weak and thready at the brachial. No breath sounds on the right side, and the belly is rigid. Patient appears pale and diaphoretic. - How many entry wounds? - We found four... shoulder and hip, through and through. Right lung and lower left quadrant, no visible exit wounds. Let's give him 2 grams of oxygen. - What's his hemoglobin? - 7.3. I need two large-bore Ivs, 6 units O-neg, type and cross for 6 more units, Chest X-ray and KUB. Notify the O.R. we are on the way. O.R. One is clear. Let's put him in there. Sorry I'm late, man. Damn, brother, look at you. That's messed up. How are you feeling? You okay? Actually... I'm great. Subtitles: Breys, Michvanilly I don't understand. I thought things were going pretty well. I... I thought we were kind of simpatico, you know? We were becoming a real team. Not so much, no. Is this about the temperature setting? Because I can assure you that will not happen... No, it's bigger than that. It's... It's... much more than that. Could you elaborate? Yes, of course I could, but I don't think either of us would necessarily benefit from a prolonged... So... I set up the entire lab. You said you liked the configuration. And I do. For the most part. Look, you're a fine chemist, really, with a promising future. It's just that... that I... that... that we just have different... Rhythms. It's... It's as if I'm classical but you are... are more... Jazz. And God knows there is nothing wrong with jazz. It's simply that I require... Classical. Exactly. Shit. Man, this is the bomb. What's up, partner? - I can't believe this. - This is my replacement? Jesus. - Nice to meet you. - What's up? Damn, we should have ditched that RV months ago. It's all, like, shining up in here. I'm sorry. I must be missing something. I don't mean to be... This... ... makes no sense. So... I guess this is... Dear mother of God. This is for the best. 200 pounds a week. Got it? Man! Okay. There's a lot to show you. Some new techniques to learn. What, now? Yes, now. We've only got a couple days before our next batch is due, and I need to get you up to speed. Right on. I'm just saying... How's the cell service down here? It's nonexistent. We're shielded. There's a hard line for emergencies. Come on. So you haven't talked to anybody today other than, you know, Captain Nerd there. Why? Your brother-in-law. What about him? Upon arrival, he was unresponsive. You getting some exposure on those wounds? - 2 units of normal saline. - We've got a bivalve mass. He's got breath sounds bilaterally. This femur is like a wet bag of gravel. The other one's not much better. Let's get those boots off. See if you get a pulse. You get a blood pressure cup or an ABI? Where's that blood? Sir, can I help you? It's all right. He's family. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say. How is he? I don't know. They won't really tell us anything and he's still in surgery. They shot him four times. Christ. Where's Holly? I got a sitter. - How are you? - Fine. Sure? I'm fine. I just need some fresh air. - Here. Let me get the door. - I got it. I'm fine. This is ASAC Merkert. Hank's brother-in-law Walt. I'm very sorry. Thank you. Can you tell us anything or any details? Right now, all we know is two men ambushed Hank. They didn't have any I.D. on them. Probably Mexican nationals. Their tattoos indicated an affiliation with the drug cartel. Why did they attack Hank? We're not sure yet. It could be in relation to an investigation that Hank was working, or it could be a message to the DEA in general. They had an ax. The cartels tend to be dramatic. Jesus. - Where are they? Did they... - Hank got both of them. He killed one outright, and the other one's upstairs in critical condition. Your brother-in-law's one tough son of a bitch to take them both out, considering he didn't even have his gun. He didn't have his gun? Why didn't Hank have his gun? The assault charge. I had to suspend Hank pending the investigation. That means I had to take away his weapon. - It's standard procedure. No one... - Okay, All right. Listen. If you would have all listened to him right from the start, and let him arrest that little degenerate, he wouldn't have had to take things into his own hands, and he would have had a gun and defended himself. - Let's just... - No. Just... It's their fault. He didn't have a gun. Honey, this isn't helping you. You. What kind of partner are you? You were supposed to back him up, and where were you? Where were you? Texas. And you. You're supposed to protect your agents instead of taking their guns, not supporting them, not backing them up... when they... Honey, let's just go and sit down, okay? I'm not doing anything until these two get the hell out of here. I mean it. Sorry... Go. You are not welcome here. The DEA is not welcome here. Come on. Come on. Let's go sit down. It's not just them. It's you, Walt. This Pinkman that Hank was looking for... Hank would have never even heard his name if you hadn't bought marijuana from him. Do you ever think about that, Walt? Do you? Do you ever think about everything that you have put him through? Stop. You're upset, and you're looking for someone to blame, and it's understandable, but don't blame Walt. It's not his fault. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sweetheart. No. Don't... It's okay. It's Hank... It's all right. All right, you're done. Okay, next. Jesse Pinkman in the house! My... dear... God. Walter White to the nearest courtesy phone.</i> Walter White, please pick up a courtesy phone.</i> We working sometime this year? What the hell are you thinking? Why are you calling me here? I tried your cell, and it went straight to voice mail. - How am I supposed to get hold of you? - You aren't. Look, man, it's been a whole day. How long is this grieving process?</i> Just put a clock on it for me. All's I'm saying is we have a schedule, right?</i> My family comes before your schedule. Dude, it's not my schedule. We have responsibilities here. I'll get there when I get there. You know what? Whatever. I'll just cook on my own. You will do no such thing. Why not? For starters, you aren't the least bit familiar with any of the equipment. There's got to be some sort of manual, right?</i> And I can read. - Touch nothing. - <i>Stop treating me</i> I'm like your assistant. I'm not your bitch to order around. We're partners. Remember? I need you to sit patiently and wait, and I will be there as soon as I can. Thank you very much for your kind words. We... We really do appreciate that. What, is your wife there? Uh, yes. Yes, she is, and she would be happy to know that you asked about her. Please do keep us in your thoughts. Tell your douche-bag brother-in-law to head towards the light. So I'm thinking, um, maybe we should go get everybody some breakfast. Yeah. That sounds good. Do you know who that was? You know, these eggs are really not too bad. Look. - Look at what? - At what? This. These spots. This fork is absolutely filthy. Tell me you see this. You've got good eyes. Look at that. Those are just water spots. Fork is fine. Those are not water spots. That's dirt. This silverware's obviously not been cleaned. It's covered in germs from someone else's mouth. God knows what. Seriously, Aunt Marie, it's water spots. Ours at home aren't any better. Yours at home are irrelevant. We're in a hospital. They need a higher standard. They have a responsibility. I'm not actually sure if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies as being part of a hospital. It's in the same building. It's all under the same roof. Do you think that sick people aren't eating with this bacteria-infected silverware? My God, how are you supposed to survive this death trap? I survived. I had my lumpectomy at this hospital. Remember that? Remember how scared we all were? I didn't want to act like it, but I was terrified. All that week, all I could think of was how they were actually going to cut me open and take out a part of me that was with me my entire life. I couldn't get that image out of my head. I think the scariest part was when... They took me into pre-op, lying there, waiting for them to anesthetize you, knowing that... You may never wake up again. Actually, what I really remember about that day is driving to the hospital. You remember me wanting to drive that day? Anyway, there we are. We're driving up Central, and we hit every green light... Every single light that we hit... green. When does that happen? Just like bang, bang, green the entire way. And the whole time, all I could think about was "Why today? "Why can't I just spend a few extra minutes "in the car with my family?" I never wanted to be stuck in traffic so bad in my life. At least I was with my family. I had that. Anyway, I survived this place. And I'm not half the man your husband is. I was going to ask you the same question. I heard that they attacked a DEA agent. Why would they do that?</i> I didn't order this, and my men would never do this on their own. Someone gave the go-ahead. Are you accusing me? I'm just saying they wouldn't act on their own. I am not in the habit of picking my own pocket. I assume that the next shipment will be delayed.</i> Any thoughts on when it might arrive?</i> A week, a month. There's too much focus on the border. We lay low for the time being. We lay low, and then we get the real story from my man who survived. Your man is in custody. He's innocent until proven guilty. Correct? I'll get him the best lawyer, and then we'll learn the truth. Keep me apprised. Any time you've got that close proximity to the spine, there's always going to be cause for concern, but, as I say, it's really too soon to tell. He's out of surgery, at least, which is... Out of surgery, on his way to recovery. All right. Where's that? Unfortunately, you can't see him just yet. We're gonna have to wait for him to stabilize. How long will that take? I can't really say. Could be hours, but we'll let you know just as soon as you could see him. Thank you. Maybe we should get you home for a couple hours? Get some rest? I'm not going anywhere. Me, neither. Is anyone else dying to brush their teeth, or is it just me? What if I ran over to the house and picked up a few things? I could swing by your place. That would be great. Thanks, Walt. We just heard he came through? Yeah, well, it's... You know, guardedly good news. Thank God. I'll take it. Hey, guys, this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt. We were just swapping Hank stories. That could go on all day. God knows, there's a million of them. Meanwhile... Miserable piece of shit. Guy who shot him, the one that's left, he's up there, got the painkillers going on, resting comfortably. Your tax dollars at work. You ought to see what Hank did to that bastard. Want to see? Come on, let me show you. You comfortable, you piece of shit? You got him? Come on. Easy, easy. Fallacies Fallacies One for you and two for... Finally. About damn time. Why isn't there anything cooking? Walter White to the nearest courtesy phone.</i> - <i>Operator.</i> - This is Walter White. I'll connect you. We got problems, big ones. Reverend, so nice of you to call... Again. Turn your phone on already. You know, I will definitely look into that.</i> I'll tell you what. Why don't I just call you right back on my cell phone. I told you to wait. I don't know how many more ways I could say it. Yeah, dick, I was waiting, and then that creepy, quiet guy showed up.</i> - Gus came by? - Not him, man. Apparently I'm not worthy of meeting him. It was the other one, the one that I'm qualified to speak to. He started asking questions, like why I haven't cooked anything. We have a quota. It's due tomorrow. Do you seriously not care, or what? Because that guy, he's got, like, the dead eyes.</i> Let me ask you something. Do you remember when we were out in the desert with Tuco? You mean when he put a machinegun to my head? Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell. Why? He kept saying that someone was coming up from Mexico to get us. Do you remember? Now, who was that? What has this even got to do with... I don't know. It was... His cousins. Right, Jesse? It was his cousins. Cousins. Whatever, man. Why? Any news? No change. I didn't know whose toothbrushes were whose, so I... I just stopped by the drugstore. Thank God for travel sizes, right? I think I'm going to go wash my face. I'm going crazy. Do you want to come? I got candy bars. Is this what you were asking for? I skimmed through it. Looks interesting. Uncle Hank gave it to me. What's it about? Pablo Escobar, this big drug guy in the '80s. I remember seeing him on the news. It's more about the guys who investigated him and tried to bring him down. Some of them were DEA, you know? Uncle Hank said that they were worth learning about, that everybody knows who Pablo Escobar is, but nobody knows about the guys that brought him down. I guess I never thought about it. He said that good guys never get ink like the bad guys do. So he gave it to me. Figured I'd read it. I need to... I'll be right back, okay? No, I assure you. We are hard at work. Absolutely. So I can expect delivery by tomorrow as scheduled.</i> No. Unfortunately... Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to keep our schedule this week. But not for lack of trying. Is there something I should know? To be completely honest with you... Gale really screwed us up. I mean, not on purpose, of course, but he just... He set us way back, and we've been playing catch-up ever since. And I've had to be out running errands and trying to keep us on target. Some of the equipment wasn't calibrated correctly and... It's just all very technical and boring, but rest assured that... that we will do whatever it takes. It has my total attention. We'll cook through the weekend if necessary.</i> We will have 400 pounds for you by next week. I have your word on that? You do. You have my word on that. Thank you for the update. Any news? I'm just wandering. How's everybody doing? Well, as well as can be expected. It's this not knowing that's the hardest part, I think. Anything new on these guys? Who they are? What they wanted? No, nothing yet, but we'll get it. Steve... Do you think there could maybe be others? Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank. That was their one shot, and they blew it. No way. I'd love to walk in there and shoot that bastard right in the head. Me, too. Great. We'll be right down. Food's here. You like Pollos Hermanos? On occasion, yeah. Owner's a big booster for the DEA. He heard what happened. He's going to feed every cop in the building. That's wonderful. Yeah, and apparently he's bringing it by personally. - I don't even know what to say. - That's an incredible... Good? Delicious. That's so generous of you. Thank you very much. Yes, thank you. Guys, did you hear that? Mr. Fring is offering a $10,000 reward on any information about the case. That's wonderful. Thank you, Mr. Fring. You're very welcome. Men like your husband are the thin blue line between us and these animals. I only wish I could do more. We do appreciate your support. This reward could turn the tide here. It'll really help. Again, I can't express how sorry I am. As it happens, I actually met Agent Schrader. Really? Our fun run, a couple months ago. Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors. I talked for a few minutes with your husband. As a matter of fact, Mr. White, your name came up. Really? There happened to be a collection jar out for you, and we spoke briefly about your health concerns. I hope that there's been good news. Things have improved, yes. That's wonderful to hear. It was clear to me how deeply he cares for you. I've taken up enough of your time. Thank you again very much. It was a great pleasure to meet you. - Thank you. - Yes, thank you. - Let me walk you out. - It's not necessary. You know, I didn't say thank you. I'll walk him out. I'll be right back. Enjoying the chicken? It's good chicken? I just wanted to thank you again. It's my pleasure. May I speak with you? Just a moment? You knew. You knew my brother-in-law was with the DEA. I investigate everyone with whom I do business. What careful man wouldn't? He is not a problem for us, for our business. Your being here is... Is this some sort of message? I'm supporting my community. I hide in plain sight, same as you. - Are we done? - This attack on my brother-in-law... I don't understand it. I don't know what it means. Please, if you have some knowledge that you could share with me. I fear for my family. I'm sure they'll be fine. I am told the assassin that survived is gravely injured. It's doubtful he'll live. Now thank me and shake my hand. Thank you. Thank you again. You're quite welcome, Mr. White. What's going on? What's happening? Starting chest compressions. One, two, three, four. - Defib? - No reason. Patient is in asystole. Continuing chest compressions. - Give me a liter of saline wide open. - I can't get a pulse back. Still nothing. All right. Stopping compressions. Time. 8:43. Time of death. 20:43. Burn in hell, you piece of shit. I assume you heard the news. Your man died. I heard. It's unfortunate. Yeah, "unfortunate", and meanwhile, I have <i>Federales</i> surrounding my house. You know what I think, Gustavo? You're behind all this. Why would I do this? How would it serve me? That's the part I'm trying to figure out. Go off on your own, maybe. Would you actually think that would work? You sound like you're under a lot of stress.</i> Maybe you should call me back when you're seeing things more clearly. I see things clear enough. One DEA gets shot. All of Washington starts barking. The D.F. suddenly has to put on a big show, and I wind up with Federals in my rose bushes.</i> But just for a while. Appearances, politics. Are you still there, Gustavo? I'm here. I'll weather this. I always do.</i> My brother's a police chief. I got connections. They'll get me through. And when I get proof and the others find out what you've done, maybe we come pay you a visit. Maybe we... How is he? Tell me something good. I think he's stable enough now for you to go see him briefly. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid it's immediate family only. We're all family. I understand,
