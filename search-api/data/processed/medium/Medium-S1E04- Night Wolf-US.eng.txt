And on the way I dropped it I dropped it, I dropped it And on the way I dropped it A little boy picked it up and put it in his pocket A tisket, a tasket A green and yellow basket I wrote a letter to... Bridge? Come on, I'm begging you. Open the door. - You have school. - No! I hate school. Yeah, well, I like school and I still have to get dressed! Unlock the door, you little freak! - Ariel! - Hey, what's all the racket? Mom, I want my own room! Bridgette, you know you're not supposed to lock the door. And I want my own private island and a private jet to take me there... - Bridgette, answer me! - ...and cook and a houseboy to pamper me when I arrive. - It's good to want things. - Bridgette? She's okay. Honey, you've got clean clothes folded in the laundry basket. Go get dressed in my room. Freakazoid! I'll take care of this. Where you going? Mommy, what are you doing out there? I came to talk to you. Are you in your underwear? Aren't you worried someone might see? A little. But I'm more worried about you. Don't worried about me. I'm fine. I'm just going to stay in my room for the rest of my life. Oh... okay. Well, what do I tell your teacher? Daddy and I are supposed to meet with her this morning. I don't know. Tell her that... that I hate school. Okay, I'll tell her. And you're just going to stay in there? Even though Mommy and Daddy have to go to work and you'll be all alone in the house? You're okay with that? I would be scared to be all alone in the house without you. But if you're okay with that, I'll see you after work. Mom!! Yeah? Maybe I'll stay in my room for the rest of my life on a day when you don't have to go to work. Mm, okay. That makes sense. Tell you what. You go unlock the door and I'll come around and meet you and we'll have some breakfast, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Go. She's smart as a whip. I actually think, in some ways, that may be part of the problem. I'm sorry. I guess we didn't know there was a problem. Not academically. Academically, she's stellar. But I am concerned with how she's doing socially. Working in groups. Playing with others. That sort of thing. She seems to have a hard time with it. Really? Mm-hmm. I've noticed she spends a lot of time alone, playing by herself. Is she like that at home? Yeah. She has a very active imagination. But that isn't bad, is it? No. Not necessarily, but... if a child is lonely, if they feel separate and apart... it becomes difficult for them to enjoy coming to class, being with others. So, I'm worried because she doesn't seem to have many friends. To be perfectly honest, she doesn't seem to have any friends. The other kids-- they avoid her. I should've seen it. I should've realized. I mean, I've always known that she was... unique. I just... No friends? With Ariel, it was so easy. She was somebody everybody always wanted to play with. All I had to do was sit back and wait for the phone to ring. This is my fault. I should've been out there, making play dates, arranging sleepovers. Wait a second. It's not like it's too late. She's in first grade, for goodness sake! You're right. You're right. I'll make some calls as soon as I get home. Call some of the other mothers. Maybe set something up for this weekend. Wait, wait! I have to go into the D.A.'s today. I got to drop Marie off at day care. Maybe this was not the greatest moment to go back to work. Hold on. Can we not blow this out of proportion? We have a problem. We have a plan to solve it. You'll make the calls tonight instead of an hour from now. End of crisis. - What if I have to work late? - Then I'll make some calls. We're talking about helping our six-year-old make friends, not curing cancer. We can do this. She's a good kid. The lady said "smart as a whip," did she not? Hey. Consider the gene pool. And you be sure and tell my esteemed colleague that confession or no confession, if I don't have his client's affidavit on my desk by 5:00 this afternoon, I'm pulling the offer. - You're here? - I have been for over an hour. Boy, I told my assistant to call your house first thing this morning. - I had a thing at school. - And she didn't try your cell? No. - And you couldn't just sense...? - Apparently not. - So, basically, I'm here for nothing? - No, not for nothing. I mean, you'll be paid. You know what? You're right. Since you're here, since you're getting paid... You know, I don't need a mercy job. Hey, I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this for me. All I need to do is run for reelection and have someone find out I paid you and you didn't do anything to earn it. Are these the CCFs? Yes, sir. All right, now, all I need is a place to put you. Don't thank me now. You spoil me. Oh, it's not as bad as it looks. Old Wayne over there swears to me he actually likes it! Old Wayne? Sounds like something I used to drink. Criminal sketch artist. You'll be sharing this space with him. And what exactly is it you would have me do in this sumptuous space? You ever heard of "Cold Case Files"? Yeah, but I never watched it. No, not the television show. These are the real thing. They're cases that are cold. Mysteries that are unsolved. Unsolved Mysteries. Never saw that either. What I'd like you to do is spend a little bit of time looking at each one of these files. - See if you get some sort of vibration off of it. - Ooh, "vibration"? Whatever it is you get, when you get, whatever it is you get. - Got it. - Good. I'll be in my office. That would be that room with all the windows? Right you are. All right, let's get started. I'll try, but like I was telling the officers, it's not like I got a really good look at him. It was dark, and I was hiding from him. And then I was running from him. It's all right. Just do the best you can do. Let's start with something easy. Let's start with, uh, hair color. According to the investigating officer's police report, you said the perpetrator had blond hair? Yeah. Brownish blond. I think so. You think so? No. That's it. Definitely. Brownish blond. And short. So we're talking about a Caucasian? You mean a white man? Yeah, he was a white man. What about his stature? Are we talking tall man, short man, fat man, thin man? It's okay. Just relax and concentrate on what happened. Mister... he killed my fiancé right in front of me. My clothes have pieces of his brain on them. You relax and concentrate. Miss, uh... He was a short man, really. Average to short. Just a white guy. An average to short white guy. Okay. What else can you remember? Eyes, maybe? Eye color? Did he have all of his teeth? What about his ears? Were they especially large? Just... take your time. Let me think... I'd have to say he looked like a farm boy to me. You know, like one of those Midwestern-looking types... with nice teeth and short hair. It's all coming back to me now. Anyway, my wife and I thought it might be fun for our girls to get together outside of school. Bridgette, yeah. Great. Let's see, uh... Um, how about... Sorry? No, no, actually, Bridgette doesn't have an online calendar. Does sound like a time saver. We'll look into it. Oh, so how about Saturday? She has horseback riding till noon? Huh. Um, then, book club... right. Ah, what about Sunday? A fund-raiser? Wow, I didn't know that six-year-olds did... No. I can definitely see how that would help flesh out a high school transcript. Sure. Uh... what about the next weekend? You can pencil her in? Yeah, okay, sure. No, no, it's Dubois. Uh, that's a different Bridgette. Sure, yeah. Probably should talk to Cassie first. Well, yeah, call me if she's interested. You, too. Bye. Everyone brush your teeth? Ah, my prayers have been answered. A woman sneaking into my room. And wonder of wonders, she actually looks like my wife. The better to ease the guilt. God is good. You missed some amazing franks and some even better beans. We waited at the table for you to show up. We waited for, I don't know, three hours? But by then the flies were getting so thick, the kids started to complain, and it was like, oh, heck, let's just eat without Mommy. I'm sorry. I've been looking at mug shot books for the last five hours. This witness, this woman was caught up in this... execution. Her fiancé was murdered right in front of her. And she's giving this description to the police of the perpetrator. And I'm listening and I'm realizing the man she's describing is not the man inside her head. Al... And I can't very well go to the sketch artist and say, um, "I read her mind. Draw a guy who looks like this." So, I looked through all the mug shot books, hoping... And then I looked up and it's 10:30. And now the police are looking for the wrong guy. She's probably scared, Al. I know, but I gotta think of something. You want to hear some good news? Bridgette made a friend. - No. - Yeah. Talk about timing, huh? Oh, she came home from school all excited. They played on the playground. They ate lunch together. She can't wait to go to school tomorrow. Oh, God, that's great! And I wasn't here. It's okay. She'll tell you all about him in the morning. Yeah, it's a him? Bobby! Bobby. Bobby who? We don't have a last name yet, but she promised to get it and a phone number tomorrow. With any luck, he'll still have some openings in the fourth quarter of his fiscal year. Mm, this is great. Maybe I'll see him tomorrow when I drop her off at school. I'm sure you will. Now may I have a kiss? - What? - A kiss. That thing we used to do when we saw each other after a long day. I like Bobby. It sounds nice. He sounds nice. You can't have him. He's already involved with your daughter. And, besides, you're already involved with me. It's not even 7:30. Why are we so early? Because I have to work today. Besides it's only a few minutes. More like 20. What are we supposed to do for 20 whole entire minutes? I don't know. Look, kids are playing in the playground! Uh, little kids. I'm sure you'll think of something. And don't forget, Dad is picking you up today. - How come? - Because I have a big day at work, and he's gonna bring home things he can do there, so try not to make too much noise. Okay. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, lips. Where's my kiss? Bye. Bye, Mom. Bye, wild thing. Wow. You are really good. Hi. Um, I'm sitting over there temporarily. Allison. I think we missed each other the other day. Wayne. It's amazing you can do that. I been at it a long time. What do you do? Oh, I'm a consultant. I work part-time with the D.A. It's pretty boring. Could I ask you kind of a nutty question? - What's that? - Do you ever, like, draw for money? What, you mean like ads or something? I have this idea-- I don't mean to put you on the spot-- but it's my husband's birthday tomorrow. And he's one of those people who's impossible to shop for. Could I give you a...? You have a picture or something, like maybe a photo from your wallet? No. I was hoping maybe I could describe him to you... All right. Okay. Let's start with his, um... complexion. How would you describe that? Well, it's very similar to yours actually. Let me see if I've got this straight. This is the man we should be looking for, not this man? Then who do you suppose this is? I think it's Matt Damon. I left a magazine laying around and I think the witness saw it and... Oh, for crying out loud. Okay, let's say you're right. Let's say the witness lied and her sketch is bogus. Well, she's not lying exactly. She's just afraid of being involved. Allison, that's lying. Exactly. Besides, whatever her reasons are, my hands are really tied. What do you mean? Well, what would you have me do with this? I don t know. Publish it. Distribute it. Go get the cops to go get the guy. Allison, I can't put this out. Where would I say it came from? An anonymous eyewitness. Oh, right. The description from the person in the room-- that's the one I tell the police to ignore. And the description from someone whose identity I can't discuss-- - that's the one I want them to pay attention to. - But... Then what? What happens if we manage to find the guy and make an arrest? What happens when the defense attorney puts you on the stand? What do you say? Better yet, what happens when he puts the woman on the stand and she says, "That's not the man I described"? I don't know. All I know is, you're looking for the wrong man. Well, maybe you're right. But if this is the real man we should be looking for, then we need to get the real eyewitness to say so. - I got a C-plus on my math test. - C-plus? All right. That's progress. Where's your sister? - Playground, probably. - Come on, let's go find her. You're it! You can't catch me. You can't touch me. Bridgette! God. Why does she have to be so weird all the time? It doesn't sound like that big a deal. So she was playing by herself. Did you ask her what happened to Bobby? Maybe he went home sick, or maybe he was playing with some little boys. That doesn't mean that he doesn't want to play with her anymore. I'm just saying... Bridgette, did you get to ask Bobby what his last name was? It's Lechelle. Bobby Lechelle. Let's see. Oh. Perfect. There's only one Lechelle. Call! Why don't you call? - You're a big girl. - Okay. Okay, I'll read you the numbers. Ready? 5-5-5-0-1-9-6. It's ringing. Hello? Is Bobby home? This is Bridgette. Bobby! He's my friend. She wants to talk to you. Hi, Mrs. Lechelle? This is, uh, Allison Dubois. I'm Bridgette's mom. No, I don't... A joke? Of course not. I'm sorry. I don't understand. You don't have a son at Central? You do? You did. I'm sorry. I'm terribly, terribly sorry. What was that about? Bridgette, baby, go brush your teeth and get ready for bed. I'll come read you a book. What? He's dead. Oh, my, God, what happened? Five years ago. He died five years ago. Do you think she knows? I doubt it. She probably just thinks he's another kid on the playground. - Well, we have to tell her. - I guess. You guess? You don't think this is a problem? We should just be happy that she has a new friend and leave it at that? - We have to do something about this. - I know. All right, okay, fine, so we're on the same page, then. Any thoughts as to why who's been dead for five years should choose to hang around our daughter? You make it sound so sinister. He's drawn to her because she can see him, that's all. I don't know if you're aware of this, but right now you sounded almost... - I don't know, almost proud of her. - Please. I wouldn't wish the way I see the world on anybody, least of all my own daughter. So what's next, she gonna start finishing my sentences for me? Start knowing things before they happen, start waking up in a cold sweat from bizarre dreams? You don't know that any of those things are going to happen. Well, I'm allowed to wonder. And I'm allowed to worry. In fact, I'd be an idiot not to worry. Got it. Sorry. - Sorry to have polluted the gene pool. - Didn't mean it like that. How else could you mean it? How do you know she's not gonna outgrow it? And just because you see one ghost doesn't mean you see every ghost. If you say so. Just because you have one dream that seems to come true doesn't mean every dream comes true. I had dream the other night, a wolf was chasing me through the airport trying to kill me. Didn't mean a damn thing. Although you are looking kind of wolfish. I'm going to check on Bridgette. So it just isn't gonna work out with Bobby this weekend. How come? It just isn't. But I was thinking, is there somebody else you like, somebody else at school? No, Mommy. The other kids are mean. All the other kids are mean. Bobby is the only one who's nice to me. What about next weekend? Can Bobby and me play then? I don't know, Honey. We'll see tomorrow. It's late, go to sleep. Ready? - She's in the conference room. - Absolutely. This is gonna be a bit tricky. I have no factual ground on which to question the validity of the sketch she approved. Show her my sketch, see how she reacts to a picture of the real killer. Love to-- only down the line the defense attorney could say that I influenced the witness. We can't even show it to her? I didn't say we; I said I. Do you remember the affidavit you signed when the sketch artist showed you the finished picture yesterday? The one on which you swear that the description you gave is, to the best of your knowledge, accurate? Well, we lost that affidavit. I feel terrible about the inconvenience, but I'm afraid that I have to ask you to sign it again. Is this the man you saw shoot your fiancé in cold blood the night of the 12th? Yeah, that's him. Any changes you'd like to make? No. Any details that have come back to you since yesterday? Not really, no. Are you sure? I'd be happy to bring in the artist you worked with. If you had any additional thoughts, now would be the time to share them. No. I'm very happy with the sketch. If you'll let me just sign the paper... Allison... Oh, my goodness. Here you go. Thank you. - Thank you. - Allison. Is there anything else, or can I go? Yeah... you could take another look. - Excuse me? - Isn't this the man that killed your fiancé? I don't understand what's going on here-- I signed your paper. I'm sorry, you're free to leave at any time. Listen, I know you're afraid, but if you don't help us, he may very well kill somebody else. I am helping you-- I'm here, aren't I? - Without you making an accurate identification... - I did make an accurate identification. There is no one on this planet that wants to see that man behind bars more than me. There is no one more frightened of seeing that man again than me. I've done all that I can. Have you caught him yet? Do you even know his name? Do you even know where he lives? Can you promise me that he isn't in the parking lot waiting for me right now? I didn't think so. So, if he kills again, it won't be my fault, now, will it? - Is not! - Is so! - Is not! - Is so! - Is not! - Is so! - Is not! - Is so! - Hey, hey, hey... - Is not! Mom, tell her-- tell there is no best friend! There is no play date! There is no Bobby! Ariel, enough. - Joe... - Is so a Bobby! Stop it, girls. Stop it...! Stop. Ariel, go to your room now. Do your homework. Now! Bridgette, go. Get your coat. You're coming with me. Where are you taking me? To jail? Just... get your coat. What's your plan, Stan? I don't know. I figure if Bobby's gonna be her best friend, then I should go have a chat with him. Bridgette? Bridgette? Move it. I don't see him. Do you? Of course not, Mommy. It's night. He's probably at home, in bed, asleep. That's the thing, honey. He isn't. He never sleeps. He's afraid to. He's afraid if he allows himself to sleep, he'll wake up somewhere far, far away and he'll never see you again and he'll never see his parents again. He's scared. Well, I'd be scared, too, if I thought I was going far, far away. But that's the thing, see. When you go to this place... you can actually see everybody. Any time you want, and you're never lonely. It's a good place. And it's his time. And we have to help him get there. Hey, Bridgette. Who's that? Hey, Bobby. This is my mom. Hi, Bobby. I know. It's been a while since a grown-up saw you, spoke to you, right? I bet you miss your mom. I know she misses you. She cries for you. She prays for you. But you can't hear any of that here, can you? You need to be in a place where you can hear everything... see everyone. There is a place like that, you know. And there are a lot of people waiting for you to show up there. Your grandpa and grandma. Lots of other relatives you've never even met. It's a wonderful place. And to get there, all you have to do is to relax. And let go. Close your eyes. Aren't you tired? Come here. But, Mommy... I don't want Bobby to go away. Where he's going, he will always be with you. In your memories, and in your heart. He will be watching you. And if you miss him... all you'll need to do is think of him. Okay? Okay. Let's go lay down. It's for you. Who is it? Oh, I think it's your witness. - Ticket and ID, please. - I'm not actually flying tonight. My name's Allison Dubois. I'm with the DA's office. I'm here to secure an affidavit from a witness who's leaving the country. I was told that my office called ahead to let you know I was coming. - I came as quickly as I could. - Thank you. Thanks for coming. I feel safe here... you know? They check for guns. My plane boards in 20 minutes. Let's just get this over with. That is the man, isn't it? Just so we're clear... I'm not coming back to testify until you've got him locked up. Till you've got him where he can't hurt me. Everybody understands. I know you think I'm crazy, running way like this. I know what happened... I mean, I wasn't there, but I read your statement. He knows me. He looked right at me. That night, I was supposed to be dead. He meant to kill me. He means to kill me. Who is this guy? Do you know him? I mean... what sort of a criminal is he? He's the worst kind. He's a cop. I don't know his name or anything, but I know he's an undercover detective in Vice. My boyfriend told me that nobody moves any kind of narcotic in south Arizona unless he gets a taste of it. I'm sorry I lied to you. I didn't know what else to do. A tisket, a tasket A green and yellow basket I wrote a letter to my love Can't be too careful. Wait a second. What did you say the detective's name was? Wolfe. Detective Wolfe. I'm here on official police business. Hey... did you say Wolfe? Hey, wait a sec. You know what? Let me walk you to the gate. I just have this feeling... Police officer! Stop or I'll shoot! - Don't stop! - What do you mean?! Just trust me. An eyewitness to murder and an employee of the District Attorney's office narrowly escaped death here at the airport... If I don't see some bodies fully dressed and making their way to the car in the next 30 seconds... ...to get the witness's signature on some legal documents. - Unknown to both women, they were being followed... - Mom... I don't feel good. You never feel good. In the car, or nobody's going to feel good. ...a Phoenix Police detective gave chase and the two women found themselves trapped at the end of an unoccupied jetway dangling three stories in the air. - Did anyone remember to shut off the TV? - Fate and a passing luggage carrier intervened, and... - Don't forget to give that envelope to Mrs. Cass. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - See you later. - Bye. - Bye. Ding-ding-ding. Last stop. Everybody out. - You lied to me. - About what? You said he'll always be with me. He is, honey. He's with you right now, watching out for you. Well, I don't see him. Well, he's there. And he's there. And he's there. Now, give Mommy a kiss. - Bye, baby. - Bye. See ya. Whatcha doin'? We said... whatcha doin'? Mmm, nothin'. Why aren't you playing with your friend? He had to go away somewhere... Okay, I'll tell her. You can play with me and my friend if you want. What friend? He's 'maginary. His name's Wilbur. He's a giraffe. What kind of giraffe? The spotted kind. The kind that lives in Africa?
