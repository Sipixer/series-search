No-no, no head trauma, nothing like that. It-it just... I don't know. It just happened. BRIDGETT What's going on? Why does it feel like the middle of the night? Paon me. Can you hold on just one second? It ithe middle of the night, Brid, and I'm on the phone with the emergency room and I really need you to get back to bed. Why's Daddy Bed, bed. Oh, really? That would be great. 9:00 a.m.? Absolutely. We'll be there. Thank you. What did they say? "...tests." ??? Oh, good. Oh, thank you. Hey, I don't think we should say anythi ?ÑwGto the girls until we know more. I love you. I don't hear anything. Your wife's hearg loss is rather profound. Let's go speak in my office. What is  saying? I cahear anything! Shh, shh, shh. Okay. DOCTOR: I believe your wife is suffering from something called SSHL: suddenensorineural hearing loss. It can be caused by any number of things. About, uh, 30% of the time, people just wake up with it. w, the good news is, for most people, the condition simply goes away on its own. But you're reasonably confident that whatever it is, whatever is causing it is not a permanent condition? (ringtone playing) Sorry, that's my wife's phone. Hello? CYNTHIA: Forgive meI'm looking for Allison Dubois. Have I dialed the wrong number? No, no. This is her husband Joe. Can I ask who's calling? My name is Cynthia Keener. Your wife and I have been doing some work together. I wondered if I might have a word with her, please. To be honest, Cynta, she woke up this morning not feeling terribly well. In fact, we're at the doctor's right now. Can I have her call you back? One of us call you back? Of course. Uh, please tell her I hope she feels better.??? Sorry. You were saying? You asked me if this sort of hearing loss is ever permanent. And is it? It can be. But... we're a long way from even thinking about that. JOE: What's going on? BRIDGETTE: What's all the hollering about? Hey, hey, are you all right? Mom, was that yo This silence is so... It's like somebody just put a blanket over your head. I felt like I was going to forget how to breathe. And I thought maybe if I just... scream! Maybe I'll hear it. Maybe it'll start something, and I'll be okay, but it didn't work. Please don't be scared, guys. It's okay, Mom. I know you're going to get better. What?! Feel better, Mom. Just don't scream. It's scary. Oh, I love you, too, babe. ??? What's that? What are you doing? I don't want to look at anything on the computer. THE GIRLS ARE IN BED Cool! Tell me something else. KEENER CALLED NEED TO CALL HER BACK WHAT DO I SAY I don't want her to know. I don't want anyone to know. Maybe you should just tell her I have the flu. How are <i>you</i> doing? MAYBE A LITTLE LONELY (moaning passionately): Mmm... Mmm... Yeah. Who are you talking to? Hold on. Sorry. Hold on one seco. Cynthia Keener. Who? (shouting): Kee-ner! Yeah. Okay, Miss Keener, I'll, I'll pass everything along to her. Yeah, any information that she gets, I'll give it to you right away. Okay. Okay. Hey. (whistles) Come... "She has a case for you." I thought you told her I the flu. "Kidnapping night before last. 12-year-old girl." COMPLETELY DEAF. ??? JOE: Nicole... Swenson is the daughter of... Of Laura and Darrin Swenson. Daughter of Laura and Darrin Swenson. Got it. Laura's late husband founded the Lyndhurst Land and Lease Company. You may have seen thbillboards. Okay. She really can't hear anything we're saying? No. No, she really can't. Okay, well, the, uh, Swensons' family attorney is an old friend of mine, and he's hired me to work the point and negotiate any and all discussions with the kidnappers as we work to get Nicole back. What about the police? We don't want the police involved. The family was given very strict instructions by the kidnappers. Listen, I-I can't do this anymore. I've got to get back to the Swensons. How about I talk to you, and you talk to her? Okay. So Allison says she saw the men wearing masks. That's what she said, yeah. Tell her that's good. Tell her that's very good. That if, in fact, they're purposely hiding their identity from the girl, it means they probably don't want to kill her, that they're ready to hand her back alive as soon as theget their money. Okay. Tell her also that it's very useful to know that they're communicating in sign language. Th would suggest that it wasn't really a crime of opportunity. It was very well planned. They don't want to hurt r. They, they just want their money. Okay. All of this will be very important once we start our negotiations with the Thank you. Mr. Dubois, uh, would you please l me know if Allison gets any more... particulars? Absolutely. I've got to go to the house now. What did she say? I feel a really bad case of carpal tunnel coming on. Testing. Testing, testing. But I don't understand. I'm, I'm asking you a simple question. Well, please connect me with somebody who can. Watch your tone. Just... Who's he talking to? I'm on hold. It's the insurance company. Mr. Swenson, wou you please hang up that phone. When I'm finished. We have a kidnapping and ransom policy. Now they're telling me they won't give us theoney. Well, of course not. That not how insurance works. They only reimburse <i>after</i> the ransom has been paid. Now, please, Mr. Swenson, will you hang up that phone? They can't help you. The fewer people who knoabout your daughter's kidnapping, the better right now. Come on. Let's... Let's sit down. I don't understand. What are we gonna do? We're gonna do whatever we need to do. Now, I know this is difficult, but you have to think about this as a business negotiation. You haveomething they want. They have something you want. We want to resolve this as quickly as possible without anyone getting hurt. But that's what I mean. What they want, I don't have. I don't have five million dollars. Not just lying around waing to get thrown into a duffel bag. We will find it. We're, we're talking to the banks. We'll remortgage the house. That's why we have Cyrus. That is what he's good at. Tell him. Unfortunately, Darrin has already given you a fairly accurate assessment of our situation. With the banks... With the mortgage... I think the st cas we can put together before day's end is somewhere in the neighborhood of three to three and a half million. I mean, if I had more time... We'll offer them three million. Weren't you on the same phone call that I was? They want five. We have three. I don't believe they're gonna find a buyer who has more. How can you be sure? How can <i>you</i> be sure that they won't do something... awful? ??? I mean, there wouldn't be an upside to it. There's no profit to be made from it. For the men who took Nicole, this is just a business venture. They don't want this thing to drag out, and three million dollarC.. is an ful lot of money. Now, when they call, I'm gonna talk to them. Trust me. This will work out. MARIE: Mommy. Mommy. Mommy, Mommy, Mommy. She can't hear you. Come on. I'll read you the book. I want Mommy to read it. But she can't. I'll do it though, okay? Okay. Okay, let's go. Hey. "Is your mama a llama?" ARIEL:There we go. MARIE: Okay. ??? ALLISON: Can I do that? Okay. "Is your mama a llama?" You guys are reading. I can do that. "'Is your mama a llama?' "I asked my friend Dave. "'No, she is not,' is the answer Dave gave." What are you doing? You're calling Cindy? You can't call anybody. You're not gonna be able to hear them. Cynthia Keen. We have to call Cynthia Keener. Why? It's the middle of the night. All ri Nev ??? The place where the video was shot, it had a very rustic feeling to it. like a... like a cabin in the mountains. AnI also saw a glass, a water glass, and on it was printed the name of a local diner. Well, I saw a video about an hour ago, but I didn'tsee any Well, I'm not sure it was actually in the video. I think they realized... you could see it. One of the kidnappers pulled it off the table before they started cording. It sd "Mano's Diner." We looked it up online. A Mano's Diner is in the White Tank Mountains, just outside of Phoenix. The White Tank Mountains. Hmm. Well, that's the first real clue we've had since this whole thing began. Well, I mean, the glass doesn't actually guarantee that they're somewhere near the diner. ll, still, it's a's a good start. She's quite amazing. (loudly): Would you-- would you like to stay with me today? ??? I would like for you to stay with me today. CYNTHIA: Laura, Darrin. This is Allison. Allison's an investigator I work with. She, uh, has reviewed the ransom tape and has some pretty strong ideas about where it might have been shot. Oh, my goodness. Well, it's, uh, it's not a certainty, but Allison feels that your daughter might be in the White Tank Mountains not far from here. Excellent. So, uh, what do we do? Well, I'm about to sqÑd some people up there right now. Uh, we're going to work as many angles as possible, gather as much information as we can, and continue to negotiate. Thank you. It's, it's, it's just such a comfort... Um, Allison is profoundly deaf. It's one of the reasons she feels such a strong connection to Nicole and why she's been working so hard on this particular case. I know we forfeit interest by cashing in now, but I need access to those funds. That could be them. Is everyone ready? Swenson resince. (electronically altered): Who is this? Gentlemen, this is Cynthia Keener, just like the last time. I need to talk to the Swensons. I'm sorry. Uh, I thought I'd already explained to you that that's just not going to happen. We very much want Nicole back and, uh, we're very anxious to get this whole thing moving, but you are going to have to deal with me. And how can we be sure you're not the police? You're jusgoing to have to take my word for it. Again, all I'm interested in is getting you your money and getting the Swensons their daughter bk. Now, uh, we've seen your tape. We believe you have her. How do we move this thing along? You have the money? We do. $5 million? Three, we have $3 million. But the price is five. Well, I understand the price is five and I'm lling you all we have is three. You justive us Nicole back and we'll give you $3 million. (whispering): Tell them we'll give them the money. W-We'll figure out a way. We just need a few more days. No, no. Gentlemen? Gentlemen, we-we're not hearing anything. Gentlemen? Five. Three. I'm offering you what the Swensons have and what they have is $3 million. Cash. (phone clicks) Hello? ial tone) Hello? They're gone. You're fired. Excuse me? I told you. We can get them their money. But we have no more time. Every second that you alw your daughter to spend with these people, you put her further and further in peril Now, truste, they want to make a deal. They want to give you your daughter back and they want their money. They want the same thing you do. $3 million or $5 million, they want what you want: they want this to be over. Did you get anything? No. They're going to call back. How can you be so sure? Well, like I told you before, it's not as if there's another buyer out there. They're going to call back. Well, I hope you're right. I hope you know what you're doing because if anything happens to our Nicole... ??? YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DEAF VERY LONG, HAVE YOU? Swenson residence. MAN (voice distorted): We'll take the $3 million. Get it ready. (sighs) (sobs) It is ready. Where do I meet you? Not you. Have the father bring us the money. I'm sorry. He's not available to do that. I'll, uh, I'll be bringing the money. Well, then I'm sorry, but his little girl won't be available to be returned. Either the father brings the money or there's no exchange. Listen tme... No, listen to me. I'll be calling back with final instructions shortly. At that time, I need the father to bring the money. I will be watching. If the father is followed by police, by you, there'll be no exchange. You'll find nothing. You'll find no one just the corpse. Cyrus, get the money ready. I'm going to need an armed team to follow Mr. Swenson to the drop. Lady, you follow me, you order anybody to follow me, I'll come back here and I'll kill you. Mr. Swenson... Or shall I kill you now?! Cyrus, where are we with that money? MR. SWENSON: It's two hours. What could be taking them so long? GIRLS IN BED LUV U GOODNIGHT Mmm. Oh, I'm not sure if you've actually answered the phone yet or not. Actually, I'm not even sure if the phone's finished ringing yet or not. I miss your voice. I miss the girls' voices. The sound of the house in the morning. The way that you sigh when you roll over in bed. Sorry I'm not there. Honestly, I'm not really sure what good I'm doing here. ??? I know that I am not easy. But I do love you and I hope you still love me. Anyway, if you're there... sweet dreams. Sleep tight. And know that I love you. And if you're not there... ...sweet dreams. Sleep tight. And know that love you. Hi. Allison. She saw one of them. One of the kidnappers. She can identify him and he knows it. They're going to have to kill her now, aren't they? Mrs. Swenson... I need your help. I need you to convince your husband to let me call the police. What, what are you talking about? They said no police. That's... that's what we agreed on. That's what we promised. I have new information. ??? It's her, isn't it? You, you told us her first name, but you never told us helast. It's Dubois, isn't it? What does she know? She thinks your daughter may be in serious danger. Now, we havepeople the White Tank area for this cabin. But with police help, we have a much better chance of finding her. ??? changing the plan. Are you insane? We're almost there. We're one call away and now you want to double-cross them? Now u want to give them a reason to kill our little girl? I fear they already have a reason. What are you talking about? What is she talking about? That's it. I'm going to the bedroom. I'm going to try and sleep. And when that phone rings, I'm doing whatever those people tell . I'm going wherever they want me to. And I am bringing my daughter ba. Mrs. Swenson, I beg of you. Please let us call the police. Otherwise, I fear we're compromising your daughter's safe return. How dareou? This is not your child. This is our child. Darrin, Darrin... Mrs. Swenson, ishis what you want? She's my baby. I... I d... I don't know you. I don't know this woman. They said no police. And we'll be... We're almost there, right? We're almost there, honey. Come on. Let's go to bed. They'll come for us when the phone rings. I heard... u had a dream. Maybe saw some, some bad guys? Want to go look at some pictures Maybe see if you recognize anyone? CYRUS: Exactly three million. One million a bag. Thank you, Cyrus. I don't understand why it is taking them so long to call back. They like this. Right. They like that wre anxious. Mr. and Mrs. Swenson... omething I'd like to propose to you. I just got a phone call from my office. They have a small, electroc portable beacon that they can have over here in ten minutes. It's tiny. It fits in the wheel well of your car and... it can give us your location if anything should go wrong. I can't risk it. I won't risk it. But, Mr. Swenson, they'll never know it's there. Looks like it's a moot point. I'll handle this from here. Thank you. Hello, this is Nicole's father. MAN (voice distorted): Is the money ready? Yes. It's ready. It's completely ready. Then it looks like you're going to get your daughter back today. Oh, thank God. I need you to follow my instructions precisely. Do you have a pen and paper? Yes. Yes, I'm ready. Drive to Deer Valley Park. At the corr of 19th and Landale, y'll find a trash can nearçhe southernmost swing set on the playground. Okay. Right on top will be a white paper bag, and in the white paper bag you'll find a cell phone. Okay. What then? Mr. Swenson. When you retrieve the white paper bag-- I'll give you gloves. ??? It may contain forensic evidence that will help us find the men who did this. Don't you understand? I don't care about the men who did this. None of us care about the men who did this. I'm not going to that garbage can wearing gloves. What if they're watching me? No. I just want my daughter back. Oh... bring her back to me. You bring her back to me. You know I will. It's almost over. I can feel it. Mrs. Swenson... I'm so sorry if me and my people have made this harder for you. But, uh, quite honestly, I've never worked with a man as... determined as your husband. He just wants it over. We... We just want it over. I guess now we just wait. I'm going for some air. Keener. We got a winner. Pardon me? She's looked through six books of mug sho5v and she finally found the guy. If you've got a computer there, I can e-mail him over to you. That's terrific. Is she sure? Is she really sure? You want to know she's sure, hold on a second. Cynthia, it's him. CYNTHIA: Do either of you recognize this man? No. There is something familiar about him. His name is David Barrington. ??? Coincidentally, Mrs. Swenson, he worked for your husband for several months last year. Oh, my gosh. Wait aute, What... What a you saying? Are you saying this is an inside job? That someone who worked fo husband betrayed him? Maybe. Maybe he still works for him. Cynthia, I'm the one who brought you in on this. I've always been in your corner, but now... My husband was right about you. What you're saying, it doesn't make any sense. Why? Whyould he hire someone to kidnap his own stepdaughter? I don't know. Maybe he's planning to use the ransom money-- minus what he's giving to the kidnappers-- to cover all the shortfalls at work. I don't know what you're talking about. What-What shortfalls? The coany is doing fine. That's not what Cyrus told me when he hired me. He didn't want you to know. Since Darrin's been running things, he's taken a lot more risks. The company's accumulated a grt deal of debt. It-It still... It doesn't make any sense. ??? For the moment. Until you're reimbursed through that insurance policy he made sure you had. My, uh... My dad had a... a hunting cabin... in the mountains. No one's used it in... in years. He won't be there. (sobbing): You're-You're wrong. You are so wrong. Give me the address. Let me prove you right. Well, well. The man with the plan. Where is she? She's in the other room. She can't hear anything. Yeah, let's get this over with. As promised, one million dollars. It's all there. Hey, come on, man. You know where I live. Listen, if I were you two? I would get the hell out of here now. In fact, I'll tell you what. I'll wait ten minutes before I go in and get Nicole. That way there's absolutely no chance she'll see you two. Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry about that. She already has. What are you talking about? Well, it was a bit of an accident. Yo daughter hurt herself. She screamed. I ran inside, but... I wasn't wearing my mask. She saw your face? Wait a second. What are we going to do? ??? I told her aut you. I told her how this was all your doing. Your idea. Well, I didn't <i>tell</i> her. Wrote it out. How can you do this to me? Do you know what this means? This means I can't take her home. We dug you a hole out back. Nicole... I am so sorry. Come on. (screams) Come on. (screaming) Come on, Nicole. Nicole! Stop it! Just so you know... it would give me enormous pleasure to put one of these right between your eyes and another through the center of your chest. Fine. Deny a woman a little happiness. NTHIA: Mrs. Swenson? There's someone here who'd really like to see you. Mom! I love you. (sobbing) ARIEL: No... Is Your Mama A Llama? Can we read about a giraffe? MARIE: No. ARIEL: Or... uh, the girl in the forest? MARIE: No. ARIEL: Is <i>your</i> mama a llama? Is <i>my</i> mama a llama? (gasps) Is your mama a llama? (sighs) Is your mam...is your mama a llama? No? Come here. "'Is your mama a llama?'"... BOTH: ..."I asked my friend Dave." "'No, she is not,' is the answer Dave gave. "'No, she is not,' is the answer Dave gave. "She hangs by her feet "and she lives in a cave. I do not belie that'sow llamas behave." Mm. Mom, can you hear? Yeah. Welcome back. It's good to be back.
