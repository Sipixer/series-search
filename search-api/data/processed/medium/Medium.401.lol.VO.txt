season of Medium?</i> Oh, it was very... It was a really nice story. Joe was held hostage. There was gunshots. There were five of us in that room.</i> Only two of us made it out alive. So he was told by his lawyer that he could actually sue. My name is Cooper Conroy. I'm an attorney, Mr. Dubois. Can you talk for a moment? Talk about what? About the millions of dollars I believe you're entitled to. What is this? It's a liability waiver. So you're saying that if I don't sign these, I can't come back to work? Allison was begging Neve Campbell, the reporter chick, not to print the truth about her. That reporter had to be, like, a little snitch. You cannot run this story! Debra! Please! What about my life?!</i> My husband's life? My children's lives? And now Allison's whole life is in turmoil and in jeopardy. Well, the press is after her. Can you talk about your relationship as a spiritual advisor to the district attorney? Do you actually talk to dead people? Her boss is about this close to losing his job. This new D.A. came in, started cleaning house, and no one seemed to have wanted Allison's services anymore. I'd like you all to meet an old law school buddy of mine, Tom Van Dyke, Assistant District Attorney out of Flagstaff and a good friend. Well, I went to work. No Devalos. He's just not there.</i> Turns out his friend they brought in to help</i> is suddenly running the place. He sends an assistant overto me</i> to tell me that my part-time consulting services probably won't be needed for the foreseeable future. Look, I understand that Manny is in hot water. I know you're on thin ice where you are, but neither of you takes my calls? Allison, Manny is on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico fishing. And as for you, what do you want me to say? You're toxic! Given the way things are going, nobody wants to hear your dreams. Nobody wants to hear from Allison Dubois. Now they both don't have jobs. How are they going to survive? I don't know what they're going to do. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, that makes no sense to me. No. We've been negotiating this deal for three and half months. Now he's insisting we close it this second? No. You can't conference him in right now. I'm with Ben. What? Uh, hold on. I'm losing you. Yeah. Hold on a second. Ben, come here, buddy. Dad? Yeah, uh... Fine. All right, put him through. Ben? Uh, no, no, sorry, Mr. Rivercott. Can you just give me one second, please? Yes, Mr. Rivercott. I'm here. Yes, sir, and I'm ready to do some business. Well, if that's all that's standing between us and a deal, sir, I'm sure we can... Ben? Ben? Buddy, can you hear me?! Ben?! Oh, God. Ben! Ben? Ben! Ben! Ben! Oh. Oh. What? Did you say something? Dream. A little boy. A kidnapping, I think. Oh. What are you going to do? Here. You want to call someone? There's no one to call. Don't you reiember? Oh, yeah. I guess for a minute there, I was hoping that was just a dream. ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾ -==http://www.ragbear.com==- Æ¬Ãû:MEDIUM µÚ4¼¾µÚ1¼¯</font> -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- ·­Òë£º¸öÈËID Ð£¶Ô£º¸öÈËID Ê±¼äÖá£ºÔ¼¿Ë</font> Oh, no, not again. Ugh! We really need to have a boy. Mm... And in the forecast- oudy, windy and cold. I'm just saying, I don't think it's fair. Fair? I don't think it's about fair. I mean, if what you're saying is true, I'm sure it's just 'cause they want to know that whoever they give the lead role to can handle the pressure and the responsibility. Being in a new school and balancing that with all the homework. So you agree? You think it's just fine that because I'm in the ninth grade, and it's my first year in high school that I shouldn't play the lead in the school play? Even though it#s the perfect play for me and it's the perfect role for me and I'm perfect for it? Here, babe. It's no good. I'm sorry, baby. That's all the peanut butter we have left. Mom, what do you think? What do I think? I think just because all the other kids are saying ninth graders never get the lead doesn't make it so. I think you ought to wait to see that you didn't get the part before you get all upset. Great. Just my luck. When I'm in ninth grade, they do The Sound of Music.</i> And then, when I'm in tenth, they'll do The Wiz or Dreamgirls. Just watch.</i> Yeah, it's tough looking like you. And now authorities and the young man's family are asking for your help. Oh, no. A $20,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to the recovery of Ben Goldman, and both the Chief of Police and acting District Attorney Van Dyke have pledged... D.A.'s Office. Of course, the election is still several months away, and just to put some things in perspective, only about 32% of the eligible electorate is even aware that there's going to be an election. But among those that are, slightly more than 70% recognized your name, and about half of them indicated that they were favorably disposed to seeing you continue... Excuse me a moment. Can you tell him it's about the missing Goldman boy? I- I think I may be able to help. I think I may know some things. As soon as he returns to the office, I'll give him the message. And you have all my num...? Boy and girls? Okay, I need everyone's attention, because today we have a special guest. So our mouths are closed and our eyes and ears are open. And now- and this is pretty exciting- I'm going to introduce a real, live police detective. From our very own Phoenix Police Force, let's welcome Detective... Is it, uh, Scanlawn? Scanlon. I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown. Who am I speaking with? It's Allison. It's Allison Dubois. Uh, please don't hang up. I know you're not supposed to take my calls. I know I'm persona non grata. Allison, we've been through this. I had a dream about the Goldman boy. I called the District Attorney's Office. I left Van Dyke a message. I know he's never going to call me back. I called the Phoenix P.D. I can't get a detective to take my call. I don't know what to tell you. Well, I have to do something. I can't see what I see, know what I know, and not do anything with it, not tell anyone. I can't go buy peanut butter and pretend that I didn't see it. Allison, they've got me doing public relations now. I'm about the furthest thing there is from a homicide detective. You are the closest thing to a homicide detective I know. Tell me what you saw. It happened in a toy store. They already know that. He used a doll, a marionette, to lure the boy. Allison, none of this stuff matters. It has to matter. Why would I see it? Why would someone bother to show it to me if it didn't matter? Did you see him? Did you see the man who took the boy? Not from the front. He was wearing a... green jacket. A green denim jacket. All right, fine. Green denim. I'll tell someone. Whether they listen, whether they care- I can't control that. Hi. Have a seat. Last time you applied for unemployment benefits? God. Uh, sometime in the eighties. Hmm. Um... Engineer? Aerospace. So, um, what are we doing to find work? I'm sending out letters of inquiry. I'm, you know, calling friends and going to conferences. It's tough because there are really only two other aerospace companies in the area that do the work in the fields that I specialize in, so it's... I got three kids in school, so we-we really don't want to leave the area. You're in a tough spot. Made good money, too. Never see it coming, do you? "Dubois. " Oh, my goodness. Dubois? I take that back. Maybe you did see it coming. I mean, maybe your wife did anyway. $111.80. All right. Thanks. Oh, ma'am, that card's being denied. Do you have another card? No, I-I don't need another card. There's a mistake. I know this card's good. I just paid the bill a couple weeks ago. Is there a problem? I have things I need to do. There's no problem. We're just sorting something out here. Okay, ma'am, that card's just going to keep being denied. And if you swipe it one more time, I'm just going to get a message to take it away from you. You got cash? Well, not enough for all this stuff. Okay. All right, let's just figure out what you really need, okay? My name? Rolen. Allison Rolen. Uh, I think I may have some information ??? $240 a week. You work for the same company 15 years. The government takes thousands of dollars every month, and then when you get fired, when you can't get work, they give you $240 a week. And act like you really ought to be ashamed of yourself for even asking for it. The guy at the unemployment office recognized our last name. He knew about you. Oh... Maybe I should take Marie out of preschool. I'm home now. It's not like she has to be there. No, don't do that. We're not there yet. Hell, haven't you been listening? I just got us $240 a week to blow on anything we want. Oh. * You see I go by the code Of the doctor of the mix * * These reasons I'll tell ya why * * You see I'm six foot one I'm tons of fun * * And I dress to a "T" * You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali * * And I dress so viciously * * I got bodyguards, I got two big cars * * That definitely ain't the whack * * I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac * * So after school, I take a dip in the pool * * Which is really on the wall * * I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball * * Hear me talk about checkbook * Credit card, more money... * Hey, what is it? Why are you breathing so hard? What'd you see, hmm? He's white. Or at least his feet are white. What I think he's doing to that little boy... Is there anyone to call? Is there anything to do? No. SCANLON What's that, Bobby, a joint? Two wrongs don't make a right, Bobby. I know, they make a left. Just say "no. " Eat me, stupid. Haven't you heard? Drugs are bad. Puppets. They, uh... they want me to try 'em with the older kids. Third graders. I hate my life. You're still a detective. What are you talking about? What it says on my badge? No. Yes. If you think you know something, if you think you can help... I don't know anything. But you said Allison Dubois called you with... With nonsense, with nothing that matters. She told me that it happened in a toy store. The father told us it happened in a toy store. Said the guy was wearing a green denim jacket. Besides, I'm on Romper Room duty. It's not my case. Make it your case. Go to the store. Look around. Flash your badge. Talk tg people. You're not listening. I'm on the Reefer Madness tour. You're not listening, after hours.</i> Look at the crime scene photos. Go see the family. People don't get irate because there are too many cops asking questions. Tell them the mayor's office sent you. Tell them I sent you. You don't get it. This new D.A... Let me handle the new D.A. *... six foot one And I'm tons of fun * * And I dress to a "T" * * You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali * * And I dress so viciously * * I got bodyguards * * I got two big cars that definitely * * Ain't the whack * * I got a Lincoln Continental and... * Hello? WOMAN Allison Rolen? I'm... sorry, may I ask who's calling? This is Ameritips. You called our 800 number and left us some information about ??? I'm following up. My name is Cynthia Keener. Uh, right, um... What can I do for you? Actually, I was wondering if we could meet. You could come to our Phoenix office, or I could come to your home. Do we really have to meet? Well, I do need to follow up. I guess it really depends if you're serious. Serious about the information you gave us. Serious about the reward. Uh, right, the reward. I completely forgot. I really don't feel comfortable meeting at my home. You know the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall? How about we meet in the food court? Say tomorrow at 11:00? Okay. How will I recognize you? Don't worry, I'll find you. That's what I do for a living. Hey, girls! Come on, hurry up! Daddy's going to pick up Marie and Bridgette and meet us at home. Hannah, honey, do you need a ride home? Oh, my God! I got called back for Maria this afternoon! Oh, my God! I know! Hey. You nervous? Terrified. Look at her. Brooke Greene? I know her. Yeah, well... she's in the tenth grade, and I hear she's amazing. She's perfect for this. I don't stand a chance. Hey, the idea is to psych her out, not yourself. Never mind. Hey, Brooke. Hi, Hannah. What's going on? I just... I know you're going out there in a minute, and I don't want you to get rattled. Rattled bx what? Ariel's mother is out there. Okay. And you know who she is, right? Yeah. Well, she's Ariel's mother. And the thing is, she already knows her daughter's getting the part. I mean, that's why she's sitting out there. I just... I didn't want you to see her and have it mess you up. Brooke Greene? You're on. Thing is, we just closed, and it's pouring out. Couldn't we do this another time? I mean, come on, you guys were here for two days. My employees are still crying about all the wages they lost. Yeah, well, the store's closed now, and no one's losing a dime. How about you just take 20 minutes and walk me through it? What's in this direction? Two bathroom doors, both locked, employees lounge and lockers, warehouse space for additional inventory. Other cops already been through it twice. Yeah, well, you know what they say. Third time's a charm. Who do you say you work for again? The Mayor? That's what I said. I hate him. Oh, don't tell me we have a leak. I just had this damn roof re-tarred a month ago. You use red tar? What are you talking about? What's above us? Toys, what do you think? Who's up here? Someone's up here! It's the mice. When it rains they come inside. It's the mice. Am I above the spot where that drop hit me? You gotta go towards the rail. Hey, hey, take it easy up there! I gotta sell that stuff. He's not here. Is he? What are you talking about? Who? I don't know. I think I was asleep. Then I felt it. His head on my chest. He was lying on top of me. And it was so real. I mean, I... I could smell his hair. Why doesn't someone call? Ask for ransom? Or the the police? Why don't the police call? Someone. I think he's gone. I think he just came to me... said "good-bye. " I think that's what it was. What? What is it? He's dead. I think the little Goldman boy is dead. No... I don't think so, honey. I just got into bed. I just got done watching the news. They didn't say a word about it. What are you talking about? It's the middle of the night. No, Allison, it's 11:45. You went to bed just after 10:00. I stayed up to watch the news. I'm telling you. Who you calling? I'm calling Scanlon. Maybe he knows something. Hello?! I'd like to speak with the officer in charge. Hello?! Would someone point me towards the lead detective, please? That would be me. You? You found the boy? I was unaware that you were even assigned to this case, Detective. Some friends in the mayor's office asked me to look into it. Kind of like an after school project. Who knows? Who else knows about this? Just me and the store manager. Coroner's on his way. Other than that... You haven't spoken to any press? I called your office, the District Attorney's Office. That's the protocol. That's what I did. This boy's parents are in a lot of pain. I'd like to try to keep this under wraps for another 12 hours or so, at least until the coroner and forensics have had a chance to take a look. Maybe generate some clues, get us closer to the animal who did this. I think that would make this a much easier pill for the parents to swallow. For everyone to swallow. Certainly make for a better story in the press. Can I count on your discretion, Detective? Can I sleep on it? No. Not unless you plan on sleeping alone. Let's keep your girlfriend out of this. I'm tired mf her calls on your behalf. I need to know if I can count on you. I don't know what to tell you. It's after midnight and I have to get up in five hours to talk to a group of student crossing guards about the importance of walking on the green and not in between. Really? I'm sure I could find somebody else to take care of that for you. A valuable man like you, you should be out in the field. A valuable man like you should be leading investigations for my office. It's not here. What's not there? Something I was sure would be. So now you're the star of the play?</i> It's high school. There are no stars, but... I'm the lead. Cool. Do you know where Daddy is? No, I agree with you, Mom. Yes. No, I agree with Oprah. In a civilized society, women should wear underwear, particularly if they're public figures, getting out of cars, being photographed. Mom... Yeah, Mom... Mom. Mom. I need to borrow some money. Allison Rolen? Have I made a mistake? Cynthia Keener. Ameritips. Allison? Hi. I thought I was going to meet you ten minutes at the food court. Oh, I just, well, um... I was early, and I saw you standing there. At Least I thought it was you standing there. I'm kind of intuitive that way. Is-is this all right? I'd be happy to wait till 11:00. Oh, this is fine, this is fine. I know it sounds so ancient, but I wanted to be a nun. You just don't hear that anymore, but I did. I wanted to wear a habit and sit in the front row Christmas mass, get mentioned in Father's sermons. So I took temporary vows of poverty, celibacy and obedience. And I don't know what happened to the vows of poverty and celibacy, but it soon became very evident that I had no talent whatsoever for obedience. So, then I decided to go into the family business, become a cop. I went to college, I studied criminology. Me, too. Back then, for a woman, it was... tough. Anyway, I saw an ad for Ameritips. And I've been an investigator with them for 20 years. And I got my wish- I'm poor, I'm celibate, and I don't have to listen to anyone. How many people phoned in about the Goldman boy? We logged about 1,400 calls. 1,400 calls? Most of those are cranks and others are people fishing for the reward money. The credible ones really jump out at you, which is why I'm here. "Green, denim jacket. " That's rather specific, isn't it? Of course, it's not the kind of clue that's going to get you a reward. Oh, I don't care about the reward. I don't care about the money. The money would be good- it would be great- but... I really can't get that little boy out of my mind. I know what you mean. This is a ground floor plan of the toy store where the Goldman boy was abducted. I wonder if you wouldn't mind indicating with the cursor where you were when you saw the man take him. What do you mean? Well, the "X" here is where Mr. Goldman said his son was standing the last time he saw him. And this green "X" here is the position of the father. Where would you have been? I mean, you would have had to have been fairly close to see that the jacket was denim. Were you in the store at all, Allison? Enjoy your iced tea. You should Google me. My married name is Dubois. Allison Dubois. D- U-B-O-I-S. I know what I'm talking about. The jacket is green. And the man who took him? He likes to dance. And... I think the little boy is dead. You think the little boy is dead? Well, I work for the parents, and I think I would know if the little boy is dead. I think you're one of the cruelest people I've ever met. Well, I'm not trying to be. I saw his spirit visit his parents last night. You saw? Look me up. It's on your computer. Right there for all the world to see. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. Bridge. Catch a tiger by the toe. I know what I want for Christmas. If he hollers... I want my own room. ...let him go. What are you doing? Choosing who's going to take me to school. Well, now that you guys don't have to be anywhere in the morning... I miss work. Me, too. What do you mean there's no evidence, Detective? This, this little boy's body is covered with evidence. He is drenched in blood. Was he shot? Was he stabbed? Poisoned. Forced to ingest something- we don't know what yet- that very rapidly brought on massive dehydration, all the fluid in his body is just gone. The skin tissue is nothing but a hard crust. The blood you see there came from his eyes, his nose, his mouth, and his anus. That's enough, Detective. We're gonna begin reinterviewing all the store employees this morning. I'm hoping that fairly soon the lab will be able to tell us the exact nature of the poison. That should certainly help point us towards whoever might have done this. I don't think we can keep a lid on it much longer. I know you're not looking forward to calling the parents. I'm just afraid if we don't... Too many people are aware- cops, lab technicians- for the media not to find out. We don't have a single clue? We don't have a single lead on who this might be? Well, there is one, but it's... not much to hang your hat on. I'm not even sure if it's credible. I need something for the press. He may have been wearing a green, denim jacket. You found a fiber? Allison Dubois had a dream. Sir? I'll, uh, call the parents, I'll notify the media the boy is dead. There are no leads at the present time. This shocking news just in. The Coroner's office confirming that the body of Ben Goldman, that young boy reported missing since last week, was apparently discovered by authorities sometime yesterday. Details of the discovery are not being shared with reporters, nor is there any press conference scheduled at this time. * I need someone * * Older and wiser * Telling me what to do * You are 17 * Going on 18 * * I'll * * Depend * * On you. * I could never do that. What are you talking about? You have the part. Yeah... but nobody was more surprised than I was when it happened. I was sure it was going to be you. What? Your mother didn't tell you? Tell me what? She seemed to think you knew. She seemed to think you dreamt it and made it so. There was no use in even trying... Well, I didn't dream it. The first I heard about you being called back was when you told me. The first... I heard about you getting the part was when you got it. Mom, this girl is Maria. Hi, Mom. Hey! I thought you guys were here the whole time. Daddy let us play at the park until the Police came and kicked us out! Turns out the place closes at dark, which makes no sense to me. Where are High School kids supposed to go and do the things they can't do at home if the park is closed? Dad! Did you grab the mail? Yeah. Why, you expecting something? I thought maybe Mom... Grandma... might have sent me something. Oh, what? Joe? I asked her for a loan. I tried to convince her it was gonna be cheaper than bail. Oh, Joe... She said she was gonna think about it. Talk to her accountant. I guess I was just kind of hoping that her answer would be in the mail. It's the mice. When it rains they come inside. It's the mice! Am I above the spot where that drop hit me? You gotta go towards the rail. Hey, hey! Take it easy up there! I gotta sell that stuff! Come on, pick up your phone. Allison, it's barely 6:00. He's probably sleeping. The nut. I don't know. He's not taking my calls lately. He hasn't been returning them either. Hi. This is Detective Lee Scanlon. Leave a message and I'll call you back. I mean, what is it that you want him to say? What is it that you want him to tell you? I mean, you dreamt the boy was a mouse. But clearly... he's not a mouse. Well... it means something. Who you calling now? DiNovi. Lynn? It's Allison. I need to speak to him. Um, he's not here. Yeah, he left a half hour ago. He's at the toy store. They're reinterviewing all the employees before the place opens this morning. You want the address? Now the last time you spoke to police you mentioned that you do open the store Mondays and Thursdays and that therefore you do have a key. Is that correct Mr... Mr. Kaye? There's a lady here to see you. Detective, I'm Cynthia Keener. I'm an investigator with Ameritips. Well... you're here early. Didn't expect to see you till rehearsal this afternoon. Actually, that's why I came by. I need you to listen to something. What do you mean? You want to sing something for me? Not exactly. Brooke? Now, Mr. Kaye, obviously, what we need from you is someone to corroborate your whereabouts for the 24 hours prior tk the discovery of the Goldman boy. You have another visitor. A mouse? It means something. I'm sorry. Not to me. Neither does the green denim jacket or the dancing. I don't know what to tell you, Allison, but you can't hang around here. I'm just starting to get some traction with the new D.A. If he finds out you were here... Fine. Maybe you could do me a favor. Maybe you could give me a call when you're done with all this. Or maybe, uh... maybe you could pick up the phone when I call you. I could probably swing that. I miss Devalos. Me, too. * Girls in white dresses * With blue satin sashes * Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes * * Silver white winters * That melt into springs... * I don't understand. When we get back home... what are we gonna do? What are you gonna do? I don't know. I'm not sure. I just can't spend another day waiting for permission to be who I am. I'm a lawyer. I practice law. It's all I really know. And if I can't do it for the people, I'll open up my own office. I'll start my own practice. * These are a few of my favorite things * * Raindrops on roses * And whiskers on kittens * * Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens * * Brown paper packages tied up with strings... * Miss Heath... apparently you also have a key. * These are a few of my favorite things... * What the hell is that? Who... Somebody unlocking the warehouse door. * When the dog bites * * When the bee stings * When I'm feeling sad... * Well, I don't understand. I thought everyone who had keys to the building were here this morning. Well, yeah. Everyone who works for us. Oh. Sorry. You, you guys having a meeting? Nobody told me. And you are? Oh, the exterminator. We have a contract. Put some poison out the other day. I'm just back to pick up the mice. The mice? Mice. Rats. They've had a real problem with them. See, I put the poison out a couple of nights ago. But thing is, once they eat that stuff, it makes them really stiff and bloody. So you really want to get rid of them before it starts to smell, and it gets into the air-conditioning. Is it okay? I... I won't make too much noise. We should question him. He has a key. Uh, you know what? I left my gloves in my other jacket. I just gonna run to my truck. Uh, you mind if I come with? Yeah. A little bit. Who the hell are you? I'm a detective with the Phoenix Police force. I'm investigating the murder of a young boy. I- I'd like to ask you some questions. * I simply remember... * What was the color of that other jacket? Was it green? * My favorite things * And then I don't feel... * * So bad! * Hello. Green denim jacket. He was doing a little dancy thing when he first walked in the room. Exterminator. Which I guess explains the mouse. So what are you doing? Me, I'm just, uh... I'm paying bills. Well, no, actually... Lee, someone's at the door. This guy Van Dyke- he's an idiot. Let me try and talk to him about you. Let me see if we can't get you back here... at least part-time. Raally. So they making snowballs in hell now? Lee, let me call you back. I Googled you. Apparently I owe you an apology. $2,500? This is a personal check. This is your check. Why are you doing this? I couldn't get you the reward. Um, you didn't find him- I mean, your clue didn't really find him- but I thought maybe we could keep in touch. Perhaps come to some sort of an arrangement. Not between you and Ameritips, but between you and me. I'm an investigator, and someone like you... I have a feeling that we could do each other a lot of good. And as I mentioned the other night, I'm really quite intuitive, too. I'll be calling.
