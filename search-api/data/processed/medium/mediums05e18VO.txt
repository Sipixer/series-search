Good morning. Yes. M. Hitchens ? Miss Boddicker, what is it now ? I need to know if you've contacted anyone. I need to know if you've called the police. Non, je n'ai contac√© personne. I have not contacted anyone. No, I have not called the police. But, M. Hitchens... But, Melle Boddicker, what would you have me say to them ? "Hello, Police. "A woman who works in my bank" is convinced it's going to be robbed. "She doesn't know exactly what day. "She doesn't know exactly what time. "She won't tell me how she knows this. Just that the bank is going to be robbed" ? But it is ! By two men in hockey masks with shotguns. Why won't you believe me ? Perhaps if you told me how you came to know all of this... But I can't. Good-bye, Miss Boddicker. And yes, please close the door. All right. I'll tell you. But you can't laugh. And you can't tell anyone else. Very well, Miss Boddicker, you have my word. You have to swear. I swear. I won't laugh. I won't tell anybody else. I saw it all in a dream. Excuse me ? It came to me in a dream. Like that lady the one that's always in the newspaper ? The one that's always in the news ? Allison Dubois ? That's not nice. You swore. You're right. This will be better. Now I get to call the police and I get to tell them, "You've got to come down to my branch right now "and make sure no one with a hockey mask "or a shotgun walks inside. "Of course I know it's really going to happen. One of my tellers dreamed it." Everybody down on the ground ! Faces down ! Faces down ! Behind the counter, let me see your hands ! Come on, let me see those fingers. You, honey, fill that bag up. Or I'll blow his head off. Saison 5 Episode 18 The talented Ms. Boddicker Traduction : CBenouchette, Croutch Dark_chii, Jayson.sosweet, Mimine Synchronisation : Mimine Will you guys stop that ? I'm trying to digest. Come on, you're going to miss Daddy too, aren't you ? Of course, we'll miss Daddy, but he'll be back Thursday night, right ? Yeah. I leave on Tuesday morning, I'm back on Thursday night. I haven't even left yet, and I'm almost home already. So can I get some kisses ? You... no wild parties while I'm gone, okay ? Okay. So, Dad... Yeah. I know that you're taking a cab to the airport, and it seems kind of silly that your car's just going to be sitting in the garage while you're gone. Where would you like it to sit ? She'd like to sit in it. Preferably behind the wheel. I mean, if you give me the keys, I could help Mom and I could take Bridgette and Marie to school and go to the market, and... Ooh, that would be great. Okay, you gave me something to think about while I'm in San Diego, so, yeah, I'll think about that. Maybe next week, huh ? Next week ? No joy riding. No friends in the car. You take your sisters to school, and you do anything else that your mom might want, okay ? And that's it. That's it. I promise. - Thanks, Dad. - Yeah, you're welcome. - You be careful. - Have a good trip. Will you walk me to the door ? I get to pick the radio station. Yeah, you get to pick your nose. So how hard was that ? Really hard. Good morning. Dr. Atwell's office. Hey. You made it. Yeah. Yeah, well, uh... I don't know, it turns out I was just down the block. I'm glad you're here. Lynn ? Lynn, hello. Dr. Atwell, you've never met the baby's father. This is Lee Scanlon. Lee, nice to meet you. Congratulations. So... 20 weeks. First ultrasound. So big question : Do we want to know the sex of the baby ? - Yes. - No. I would. Well, I have a waiting room full of patients out there, folks. I mean, you two aren't married, are you ? So I really, I have to defer to the mother. And you should defer to the mother. I'll just wait out in the hall. Lee, don't. I won't. And if you're one of those lucky commuters sitting in the middle of Bell Road and getting nowhere fast, you can thank two bank robbers who hit a Maricopa National branch today wearing hockey masks and brandishing shotguns. I mean if you're not responding to a bank robbery, what are you doing ? Ruth Boddicker, right ? Ruth ? I think I know who you are. You're Allison Dubois, right ? You're very perceptive. No. Um, just a bit of a news junkie. Oh, actually, I think you're more perceptive than you let on. Ruth, I had a dream about you last night. Me ? In fact, my dream was about a dream you had. About this bank, about this robbery. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about ? No, not really. Really ? So you didn't dream about all this ? Try to warn your boss that this robbery was going to happen ? Ruth, I know you've been through an awful lot today. All kinds of people asking you all kinds of questions but I have a funny feeling that you know exactly what I'm talking about. I also have a funny feeling that as time goes on, you're going to really want someone to talk to. Here's my cell number. Give me a call. Honey, I'm home. So what's it like ? Well, I can hear the ocean. I can't see it, though. All I can see is the parking lot. And that's 'cause there's a light out there. I got off the plane, I went right to work. By the time I got here, it was dark, so I could be anywhere. You're very missed. I very miss you. Well, you're very missed back. Hey, honey, say hi to Daddy. Hi, Dad. And how did my car survive its first full day with a 16-year-old behind the wheel ? Should I tell Daddy about the accident ? Mom ! He knows I'm kidding. You're kidding, right ? TOP STORY "PSYCHIC" PREDICTED BANK ROBBERY Honey, honey, say hi to Daddy. ...Ruth Boddicker, a long-time employee of Maricopa National Bank actually predicted this morning's daring bank heist. According to the bank's manager, Boddicker repeatedly warned that the robber was imminent. Is it true you predicted today's robbery ? I really don't have anything to say. I just want to get to my car. - Hello ? Is anyone there ? - God, poor woman. I know exactly how she feels. Allison ? We made the TV news. That's nice. You know what they said ? Hopefully we got away clean and they have no idea who we are. They did... they said that. Then they said we got away with 300 grand. 300 grand ? That's insane. There's a little over $32,000 here. You want to look again ? What are you doing ? See, I was responsible for checking the door and watching the security guard. You were responsible for taking care of the cash. I want to see the other $270,000. I-I don't have it to show you. According to the news, you do. The news... they're wrong. Look, maybe they put, like, an extra zero on it or added a comma or something. What ? Will you...? You want left or right, hmm ? It's your choice. Quit messing around. You're crazy. Stop. Don't do this. Just take mine if you want. Don't ! Joe. Joe ? It's not Joe. It's Ruth. Ruth from the bank. Ruth. I saw you on TV last night. What time is it ? It's, uh, a little after 6:00. I'm sorry to bother you, but I needed to tell you. Everything you said to me at the bank yesterday ? It's true. I do have dreams. I did dream about that robbery. And I had another dream tonight. Really ? Me, too. Just now. Then you saw it ? The one robber killed the other ? Dumped his body in the park ? What ? No, no, no. My dream didn't go that far. Oh, Allison. It was horrible. I kept hoping it wasn't true. Did you... did you see any landmarks, maybe the name of the park ? I could send the police there to look for the body. You don't have to. I already found it. In fact, I'm standing over it right now. Mommy had to go to work early, so I am driving you guys to school. Cool. I'm riding shotgun. What's shotgun ? It's nothing. It's the, uh... empty seat beside the driver that's going to stay empty because Mom and Dad say that you guys have to be at least 12 years old to sit up there. So ? So, that means that you can't sit up there. Wow, who died and made you queen of Car-ville ? I've never been through anything like this before. All this blood. All this gore. I had that dream... and it was so vivid. And I thought, "Can this be true ?" And I looked up Hoskins Park on the Internet, and there was such a place. So I got in my car and I drove out here... and there he was. I've never seen a real, live dead person before. Allison. I take it this is the woman you told me about, the woman who lead us here ? Ruth Boddicker. This is my boss, District Attorney Manuel Devalos. It's a great pleasure to meet you, sir. And you, Miss Boddicker. I read about you in the papers this morning. Am I understanding correctly that both of you had dreams in which you saw the face of whoever it was who killed this man ? Well, then, not to take up any more of your time, but it would be extraordinarily helpful if I could get you together with a detective to give him a description. We could run our composite software and see if we could generate a sketch of the killer. I guess I was hoping I would show you where the dead body was and then that would be that. Miss Boddicker, I can't force you to give me a description. I can certainly get one from Mrs. Dubois here, but when it comes to identifying criminals, the more input, the better. It would only take about 20 minutes. Actually, you might find it fun. All right, then. I suppose. Wonderful, then, we'll see you at City Hall. Third floor, anytime this afternoon. I guess it's a date. Thank you. Who'd have imagined ? Two psychics, no waiting. You want to get some breakfast ? Okay. Everybody in their car seats ? Everybody wearing their seatbelts ? Aye, aye, Captain Pushy. Everyone's seated and strapped. Aye, aye, Captain Pushy. What ? Okay, you're supposed to be helping me. What do you want me to do ? She's all buckled in. Hey, did you notice if I locked the sliding glass door in the kitchen ? Why ? Was I supposed to ? Okay, you know what ? If we're late, I'm telling Mom that it was your fault. She thinks she's so great, just 'cause she can drive. - Yeah. - Well, I can drive, too, you know. Remember the go-karts we went on last summer ? No. Well, I do. It's easy. Yeah, this is no big deal at all. Watch. First thing you do is you take this big stick thing. That was easy. Then you take this other stick thing and you pull it over to "N." That stands for "Now." I don't see a stop button. Make it stop ! Oh, no, oh, no. This is bad. That was fun. Lynn ? I don't get it. You asked me to meet you for lunch. You, uh, give me an address and it's a baby store. I asked if you wanted to meet at lunch, not for lunch. I have to start ordering some things. It could take three months to get this stuff delivered. And I just felt funny picking everything without you. Well, go ahead. Pick it without me. I mean, what you like, I like. It's not like I'm going to be sleeping in it. I know you care. I know deep down, you care about all of it. You're not fooling me. Whatever you say. You want to hear the name I'm thinking about ? No. You tell me the name, I'm going to know the sex. Lee. Yeah ? No, that's the name. Lee. Lee, Lee, Lee. It works for a girl and it works for a boy. Lee. Don't do this. But I love the name Lee. I do. Look, whatever you buy is fine. See you at home. Do you exchange foreign money ? Excuse me ? You know, I got about 500 Mexican pesos here, and I was just wondering if I could swap it for American money. Sure. I can do that. All right. Hey. You tango ? Is it Ruth ? Well, it's a small world. I just got back from Mexico on a tango weekend. I'm really a beginner. I take lessons. Oh. That's my teacher. I dance over at the Shirley Karch Studio on Wednesday nights. It's fun there. I mean, you meet people. Maybe you should try it. Well, I don't know if I'm ready for that. You look ready to me. So... That comes to $32.33. All right. Thank you. And I'll be looking for you at the Shirley Karch Studios. Take it easy, Ruth. Yeah. Come in. Hi. Hope I'm not interrupting anything. Just gave the detectives my description. Of course. You were right. It was kind of fun. They said any time you were ready. Well, thank you. I'll be over soon. So, listen. I hope I didn't get you into any trouble this morning. Excuse me ? Uh, I know you're the big psychic around here, and then here I go finding the body and everything. I hope I didn't make you look bad. Don't worry, Ruth. You're just keeping me on my toes. Okay, then. Guess if I have any more dreams, I'll just call you. Well, I'll be waiting. Oh! Oh, Ruth. The dead man. Jimmy... Jimmy Fleming. Are you sure you've never met him before ? I don't think so. Maybe at the bank. He might have mentioned a mutual interest in tango lessons ? Oh, my goodness. Yes. Of course I remember him now. But that would mean he was one of the men who robbed the bank. Pointed a gun at me. That nice man. Did this just come to you ? God, you're good at this. How come we didn't realize it sooner ? So many people come into the bank. Oh, I'm so sorry. It's my daughter. Don't worry. Allison, I have your number. If I have any more important dreams, I'll just call you. Thank you. Hello ? Hey, sweetie. Everybody home safe and sound ? Yeah. Everyone's home from school. Safe and sound. But Bridgette has something that she wants to tell you. Do you love me, Mommy ? I'm sorry. I don't think I heard you correctly. I said something happened to your car. It's nothing major. It's just the back fender... it's a little scrunched. But the kids are okay. Everybody's okay. Nobody got hurt. And please don't get mad at Ariel. It was actually Bridgette who was behind the wheel when it happened. How is that even possible ? You know what... I don't want to talk about this. I'm exhausted from this whole thing. I finally got the girls to go to bed. It's the bumper, the fender, whatever that thing is in the back. We'll get it fixed. Where were you, uh, you know, when all this happened ? What does that have to do with anything ? What, now you're taking offense ? Look, Allison, you just told me that my car rolled backwards down the driveway with our 11-year-old daughter behind the wheel. And I don't have the right to ask where you were in relation to all this ? Well, I was a hell of a lot closer than you were. I was at work. Yeah, I knew that. Your point being ? Hey, I don't know what the point is, Allison. But this is not what I wanted to hear. I don't know what to tell you. Turn on the radio. So other than that, how is everything ? Come on. You can do this. Just go in there, say hi. Nothing's going to happen if you just sit here in your car. Uh-uh, Ruth. Life hands you lemons... you go get a lemonade. Or maybe a whiskey sour. To future business ventures. So... I want to show you these. Huh ? You're serious. Hockey masks ? I'm telling you, it's like they were made for this kind of work. It's a bank robbery, not a horror film. Oh, lighten up, nobody can hear me. I even know which teller I'm going to hit. This little Miss Lonely Hearts... always making goo-goo eyes at me every time I come there. Sir. I think Ruth Boddicker's been lying to us. Well, good morning to you, too. Sir, I'm serious. I don't think she knew about that bank robbery 'cause she dreamt it. I think she knew about that bank robbery 'cause she was sweet on one of the robbers and she overheard it. Then how do you explain her ability to find that body yesterday ? Are you telling me she didn't dream that either ? I don't know the answer to that, sir. Not yet. I'll tell you what, why don't we ask her ? I called her and asked her if she could stop by on her way to work. And here she is now. Ladies, I have a bit of a problem and I'd like to share it with you. Yesterday you both sat down with detectives and gave descriptions of the man you believed was responsible for the killing of Jimmy Fleming... one of the two men suspected in the robbery of the Maricopa National Bank. Now based on the separate descriptions you gave, here are the composite sketches they've come up with. Well, that can't be. Actually, it's perfect. That's exactly what he looks like. No, no, no. No, no. I have to say something. Ruth, you know this looks nothing like the man we're looking for. He looks like it to me. In my dream, he looks just like that. In your dream ? Did you even have a dream ? Are you mad at me ? What are you talking about ? Is this because I had a dream that led us to the body yesterday and you didn't ? - Of course not. - Ladies... Because I would never do anything to knowingly upset you. But I can't lie. This is the man who killed the man we found in that park. He just is. And-and this man ? You don't recognize him at all ? You've never seen him before ? Not in a bar talking with the man that we found dead yesterday ? Talking about robbing a bank ? Listening while his partner bragged about you making goo-goo eyes at him ? Goo-goo eyes ? You don't have to be cruel, Mrs. Dubois. I think I would remember if someone made a comment like that about me. In fact, I'm certain that I will always remember what you just said to me, here, now. I have to get to work. May I go now ? Of course. Don't rush off. I've been waiting for you to get up and come out here. You're always asleep by the time I get home. You've been getting home so late. I figured that was the way you wanted it. Here's the thing. I'm actually really excited about all of it... you, the baby. I am. I know it doesn't show. I know it's hard to tell. I think I'm scared I might not be very good at it. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm terrified. Girls tried to stay up. I'm sorry I'm so late. It's not your fault the plane was late. Oh, it's so good to be home. What is this ? It's from Bridgette. She offered to skip going to college so she could get a job and pay for that dent in your Jeep. She's half yours. Hello. - Ruth Boddicker. - Speaking. Just saw you on the news. So you knew we were coming, huh ? May I ask who's calling please ? We met earlier today at the bank. I was wearing a hockey mask and carrying a big gun. Where's the rest of my money, Ruth ? They said we got away with $300,000, but you and I both know it was $30,000. I have no idea what you're talking about. Where's my money, Ruth ? You safe in your house now ? All alone ? Just you and my money ? Think again. I don't think Mom's even up yet. And that means that we can have whatever we want for breakfast. Even candy ? Definitely candy. Just who I've been waiting for. Where's Mom ? Mom had to go somewhere very early this morning. So it's just you and me, kid. I'm going back to bed. Why don't you come over here and have a seat. Am I in big trouble ? Pretty big. Ruth, those men robbed the bank, but you kept most of the money, didn't you ? That's why you gave us that phony description of the robber... the one who killed his partner. 'Cause he's the only other person who knows what you did. Ruth, you knew the body was going to be in the park 'cause you brought it there. No. I dreamt about that body. I dreamt about that robbery. And I don't know anything about any money. I'm sorry. I can't talk with you anymore. My shift's about to begin. I really do hope you'll solve this case. Can I help you ? Yeah, I wanted to pay a visit. Your name ? Last name first. Scanlon, Lee. And who do you wish to see ? Scanlon, Lee. Senior. Hey, Pop, it's Lee. You feeling all right ? So, that girl I told you about... we're having a baby. And I will never hit it. I know I got your stuff... your DNA inside me. But I will never hit it. There. As soon as she starts putting the money into the bag the robbers gave her, she turns her back to the camera. Okay ? Well, she did that on purpose. She didn't want anyone to see her load the robbers' bag with the smaller bills while she put the bigger bills in hers. Well, that's an interesting theory, Allison, but I don't actually see it. Well, I see it. Allison, no judge is going to issue a warrant because someone being held at gunpoint just happens to turn their back to a security camera during a robbery. Sir, we have to get ahead of this guy. We have to confront Ruth, get her to give that money back or this man's gonna kill her for it. You may very well be right, but, uh, this office isn't set up to protect one criminal from another. And if she is an innocent victim in all this, if he really is pursuing and threatening her, then she needs to come in this office and file a complaint. But until she does that... Anything else ? I guess not. You bring it ? $135,000. Your half. Just like we agreed on. The same exact amount you would've had when you left the bank. Yeah... Now, tell me where the rest of it is. But we had a deal. "Had." Yeah. I have it. It's with me. You broke into my house, I couldn't leave it there. Um, it's in the trunk. Keys. All right. I don't see it. Now, you give me your car keys. You can bite me, old lady. You ain't gonna pull that trigger. I'll do it ! Keys ! All right. Is somebody actually at the door ? What the hell time is it ? It's a little after 2:00. I took a killer's car, I took a killer's gun, and I took the money from the bank. Help. ***Earl Crogetch*** I'm District Attorney Manuel Devalos. I'm sorry to disturb you so early in the morning. You, uh, you look like you've had a rough night. Yeah, I actually just got in. Had myself a rather long walk. What, um, what can I do for you ? Well, I'm here to inform you that you are officially a suspect in a robbery that took place several days ago at the Maricopa National Bank. Really ? Truly. In fact, I'm in possession of a warrant authorizing me to search your vehicle for stolen money and a possible murder weapon. My vehicle ? Well... looks like you're out of luck there, Mr. District Attorney. 'Cause my vehicle was recently stolen. Are you certain about that, sir ? Because I do believe that this car in the driveway is, uh, registered in your name. By the way, you left the keys in the ignition. Not a smart thing to do in this neighborhood. Here's the search warrant I was telling you about. Okay. There's nothing in there. No, no, no, this is a setup. I didn't put that there. This is her. She took... She... She took that money ! She planted it in my car ! She stole my car ; she planted it in there ! I'm sorry, who are we talking about ? The crazy lady from the news. Th-The bank teller. The one that thinks she's a psychic. But she is psychic. It was her dreams that led us here. She was the one who told me about the car in the driveway. She was the one who told me about the money in the trunk. And she's even the one who told me this is where you lived. So, and there was one other thing... Oh, yeah. She told me to look in the glove compartment. For a gun. So, now the only question is : Will the ballistics report on this gun match the bullet holes in the body of your friend and accomplice, Jimmy Fleming ? You look pleased about something. Is it me or the box ? I don't know yet. Let's see what's inside. I called the doctor. Found out it's a girl. I like it. Girl named Lee. A whole new thing. Come here, you. Morning, Miss Boddicker. FIRST ONE HERE AS USUAL. 25 years is a long time. You develop habits. You know, I was just sitting in my office, thinking about how you came to me with your dreams and how I didn't listen. Oh, that's okay. Everything worked out, didn't it ? I mean, the bank got its money back and I'm still here. Still, I wish I had listened. And I was nicer. If you have any more dreams you care to talk about, I hope you won't hesitate. Actually, I haven't been dreaming much lately, Mr. Hitchens. Whatever it was that made me dream, I think it went away. Actually, I had a dream last night. Ask me what it was. All right, Mr. Hitchens. What did you dream ? I'll tell you but you can't laugh. And you can't tell anyone else. Very well, Mr. Hitchens. You have my word. You have to swear. All right, I swear. I won't laugh and I won't tell  anyone else. I was dancing the tango. With you. Very nice dream. Ask me when it happens. When does it happen ? Tonight, I hope. I hope you'll come by
