I saw your mother cross a crowded room and the second I looked into her eyes... everything else just fell away. That was it. Bang, I was gone. Wow. Where were you? Fat Bobby's Sports Bar and Grill. That's where all the magic started. You guys met at a place called Fat Bobby's? Mmm, well, we were in college. ARIEL: Still... Hey, you want to hear something funny Daddy and I almost met three years earlier. Really? JOE: Yeah, that's right. I was a junior in college and I had a project on display at the Mesa University Science and Engineering Fair. Won third place. Yeah, we didn't put it together till years later, but I was also at that science fair. And you guys didn't see each other? I guess not. I like to think I would've remembered. Well, that's a much better story than meeting at a place called Fat Bobby's. Too bad it didn't happen that way. Yeah, then I could be older now. I could be 11. Hey, Ariel, where's your sister? What are you talking about? She's right here? Joe, did you see her go to her bedroom? Who? Our daughter, Joe. She's right over there. Ariel, what's going on? Where are your sisters? What are you talking about, Mom? What sisters? Okay, this isn't funny. Will you talk to your children about... Oh, my God. What's happening? What's happening? WOMAN: Hey, lazy bones.</i> Wake up! Are you planning on getting up and dressed at any point today? Mom? I just had the strangest dream. www.1000fr.com Present Capture:FRM@Donale Sync:FRM@Linda</font> Allison.He's out catting around. He'll be back. You have exactly two minutes to find something to eat for breakfast. I'm not hungry. What if he gets hit by a car? What if he gets lost? I'll buy you a puppy. You ready? Mm-hmm. When I get married, I'm staying married. I'm never getting a divorce. Ally, cut your mom some slack. It's not like the divorce was her idea. I know. When I get married, it's going to be forever. Married? How 'bout we get someone to ask us to the junior prom first? Which reminds me. The Mesa University Science and Engineering Fair is this weekend. You want to go? That's so weird. Why, because it's a science fair? Girls are allowed to want to go to science fairs. And I'll let you in on a little secret. You know what they have a lot of at science fairs? Boys. No. I mean that you're asking me. I had a dream about this. About the science fair? About us going, but... it wasn't really about that. I was married and I was telling my kids about it. Kids? Three. All girls. And I was telling them about how I almost met their dad at this science fair. There's a dad? A husband? Ally, you are such a tramp. No. He was really kind of cute for an old guy. He had really great hair. Well, that's nice. Look, I hate to burst your bubble, but scientifically speaking... Dreams are just random firing of neurons in your brain. They don't mean anything. They certainly can't predict the future. What are you trying to say? I'm trying to say, I don't think you're actually going to meet Mr. Fabulous Hair at the science fair this weekend. Still want to go? Say yes. Yes. Later, 'gator. While, 'dile. JOE: Milk.</i> Pink or brown? Both. Okay. Fruit wraps... (carts crashing) I'm so sorry. I... That's okay. No harm, no... Ally? Allison Rolen? Is that you? I can't believe it! Hey. Stephen! Hey! When did you get into town? I heard you were living in New York. I was. I... New York, Fort Lauderdale, Lititz, Pennsylvania. You move around a lot in my line of work. You know, I don't even know what it is you do. Have I even seen you since high school? Are you married? Do you have kids? No wife. No kids. No dogs. (chuckles) Did I mention I move around a lot in my line of work? Marketing. Telecommunications. Cellular phones. You must do very well. Everyone I know has one. Hi. How're you doing? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Stephen Campbell, this is Joe Dubois, Hi. my husband. Engineer. Hello. Wife. Three kids. High school. Next-door neighbor. Comic book freak. You still? Still. Oh, hey, let me give you my number. Let's get together and have lunch or something. That sounds great. And, uh... how's Izzy? You're still close? No, we sort of lost touch. She went to Harvard and I went to Mesa. So I'll call you? Yeah, you better. Good to meet you. Yes. So long. Hmm, so what are we talking? Friend? Boyfriend? Unrequited love? Hmm... All of the above? Crush. I think. Him on me. Junior year of high school. Aah. He was pretty shy back then. Oh, that was not a shy hug that he gave you. Well, I guess he's not as shy as he used to be. Hello? An hour. Yeah, sure. Okay, bye. Why do I get the feeling that I'm gonna be unpacking all these groceries by myself? Huh? Huh? Looks like she was raped and then strangled to death. And here's the weird part. After she was dead, we think the killer took the time to redress her and wash her face and wrap her up before he dumped her. Tow truck driver working in the area saw a white sedan stopped on the shoulder sometime after midnight. Afraid that's about the closest thing we have to a real clue. Her name's Nancy Claymore. Her parents reported her missing two days ago. Oh, my God. How old is she? She just turned 13. YOUNG ALLISON: Have you ever seen a dead person?</i> Oh, my God. You found a funny cigarette in your mom's purse again, didn't you? I had another dream last night. Like the last one. Set in the future? I explained this to you. I just... it felt so real. I mean, it was so specific. No, it wasn't. It just seemed that way. You were in it. I mean... we had lost touch. We weren't friends anymore. Well, see, that's what I mean. That's never gonna happen. I was, like, a cop or something. Oh, future cop. Cool. There was this girl. Nancy Claymore. She was 13 and she had been murdered. Allison. Come on. Future cop? Future dream? You really think any of this is gonna happen? I don't know. When I dream it... it all seems so plausible. You know? There's nothing about it that couldn't happen. Although... Actually, in the dream... I did run in this guy. His name was Stephen, and I think he was supposed to be an old friend. From high school. I don't know no stinkin' Stephen. And I don't know no stinkin' Stephen.</i> Ah, praise the Lord. Hallelujah! The girl was blind, now can see! Looks like you're getting a new neighbor. YOUNG ALLISON: Hi. What's going on? Somebody new moving in? Uh... just me and my dad. I'm, uh, I'm Stephen. Stephen Campbell ...and we've got the mountains. And the deserts, obviously. A lot of seniors, after they get their license, will, like, rent a dune buggy and just spend the day up there getting trashed. Well, what, uh... what about comic book stores? You guys have, you guys have comic book stores? In Chicago, they're... they're all over the place. You read comic books? Uh... I collect graphic novels, yes. What? Come on, have you ever seen one? I mean, come on, you have, you have, you have Watchmen, you have Secret Wars,</i> you have The Dark Knight. (laughing) You got to know... you got to know The Dark Knight.</i> Come on. No, the guy, this guy... ah... the guy who does them, Frank Miller, he's just-- he's this, he's this genius. IZZY: Genius? Like Isaac Newton? Like Galileo? I'm talking about a living genius. Okay, I'm talking about someone who makes a difference in my life, not some guy who just had an apple fall on his head like a million years ago. Oh, don't mind her. If you say he's a genius, I'm sure he's a genius. (whispers): Thank you. But, you know, you don't have to take my word for it. Saturday, there's a, uh, comic book convention at the Civic Center. This Saturday, that's the science fair. At the college? I mean, that was the plan. You know, why don't you just... why don't you just think about that? Yeah, we will. What goes in here? Oh, um... that is my... dad's collection. Collection of what? No, it's okay. It's, it's... it's not loaded. ALLISON: Pablo.</i> Here, kitty. (dog barks in distance) DIANE: Did that cat run off again? He'll be back. Were you at the Campbells again? Izzy and I were just hanging out with Stephen. He's nice. You're not over there drinking or anything? No, Mom, nothing. I don't even think they have liquor in their house. I think Mr. Campbell is kind of... strict. Well, what about Mrs. Campbell? They moved in a week ago. I still haven't caught a glimpse of her. Oh, there is no Mrs. Campbell. I mean, I think they're divorced. Really? So he's raising that boy all alone. Mom. I don't think it's a good idea for you to get involved with Mr. Campbell. Who said anything about getting involved? There's nothing wrong with baking them a batch of cookies, is there? To say "Welcome to the neighborhood." I'm going to sleep. DEVALOS: I appreciate everyone coming together this afternoon.</i> I know that since we've formed this Nancy Claymore Task Force, we've all been taking a lot of criticism in the press, and while there haven't been any major breakthroughs in the case, there is some new information we wanted to share. Lee? Um, the police psychiatrist is saying this is probably the first time the perpetrator killed. According to him, the murder scene and the methodology are riddled with wt they call "indicators of remorse." Taking the time to re-dress the victim, wash her, wrap her in a blanket. They feel all of these things are indications that the killer felt badly about what he did. Not badly enough, unfortunately, to pick up the phone and turn himself in. DEVALOS: The doctors feel that while he's never killed, he'll probably have a long record of inappropriate conduct with minor girls. That's why we've supplied each of you with a complete file of all the registered sex offenders here in the Phoenix metro area. Study the sheets. Feel free to conduct any interviews if you feel there is cause. And what a wonderful coincidence. Here come the latest sheets. Add these to your binders. These would be for anyone who's relocated to our jurisdiction in the last four weeks, and as ordered by the courts, have registered their whereabouts with the police. Oh, my God. You know this man? I knew him... in high school. Suddenly last week, there he was in the supermarket. Says here he raped a 14-year-old girl back in Pennsylvania. You've got some interesting friends. STEPHEN: Hey, Allison.</i> Wake up. Allison. (dog barking) I've got a surprise for you. What are you doing here? It's the middl of the night. Yeah, I couldn't sleep, and I saw this little guy sneaking through my backyard, so I chased him down. I know how worried you get when he's out all night. thanks for bringing him home. Yeah, no problem. you should, um... you should probably get going. Yeah, I don't want my dad to figure out I'm gone. But I'll, I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah. What's the matter, Future Cop? You look like you've seen a ghost. Don't make fun. I had another dream. Oh, boy. Just give me your opinion. What if I saw something, dreamt something about a person? Something horrible, something that they were going to do in the future. Even if I couldn't prove it, shouldn't I tell somebody? Shouldn't I try and stop it? Um, in my opinion, no. No? No, people will think you're nuts. I'm your best friend, and I think you're nuts. But I'm talking about something-- it's so awful, it's so evil... Hey. You want to know what I really believe? You don't like the way the future looks? Change it. It hasn't happened yet; it's subject to alteration. You believe someone's going to do something awful. Then don't let them. For that matter, if you believe we're going to stop being friends, don't allow it. The next time someone wants to do something with you, and you already have plans with me, don't tell them that you'll think about it. That's my future. I've got to go. Well, Izzy... I got class. Hey. So, uh, what have you decided? About Saturday, the, uh, comic show? Yeah, I know. I, I just... I can't. Wh-why? Because I can't. I mean, I don't want to. I'm going to the Science Fair with Izzy. I told her I would, and she's my best friend and she's counting on it. All right. Okay, well, then maybe we can, uh, maybe we can do something Sunday. I don't think so. I mean, I'm kinda feeling that maybe it would just be better if... I don't know. Well, why? What, what... have I done something wrong? No, it's just... it's me. I'm going through something. Trying to figure something out. Maybe, maybe I can help. I don't think so. Not right now. You sure I haven't, I haven't done anything... to make you, make you mad at me? No, you didn't do anything. I'm not mad at you. Yeah. Right, I mean, how, how could you be? All I did was bring back your cat, right? I really do appreciate that. Yeah, sure you do. Really, I'm sorry. It's... really, it's me. Yeah, sure it is. SCANLON: It's right this way, Mr. Campbell.</i> This should only take a few moments. Whatever you say. I'm just, I'm completely baffled as to why... Stephen, it's nice to see you again. Allison. I didn't get a chance to tell you I work for the District Attorney's office. I asked the detective to contact you. I was hoping you could help us with the Nancy Claymore case. I'm sorry. Who? SCANLON: A 13-year-old girl. She was kidnapped and murdered last week. We're conducting preliminary interviews with several persons of interest based on their histories of sexual assault on minors. Stephen, please, have a seat. SCANLON: Two years ago you pleaded no contest to a charge of sexual battery on a 14-year-old girl. Yes. I made an error in judgment. You want to tell us about that? She told me she was 20, and I believed her. According to her deposition, she asked you several times to stop. It looks like the charges were reduced from rape to battery to avoid a trial. Because they couldn't prove their case, because there was no case. It was all lies. When her parents found out about us, they got angry at her, so she lied to them about what happened. She lied to them the way she lied to me, and now because of her lies, I'm considered a predator in the eyes of the law. So what do you want to know, Detective? Allison, how can I convince you of my innocence? SCANLON: You can tell me where you were on the afternoon of the 15th. I... I was at home. Can anyone else confirm that? No, I don't think so. What color car do you drive? White. Would you be willing to provide us with a sample of your DNA, or are you gonna make me, uh, fetch it from Pennsylvania? Uh, I have nothing to hide. Okay. You'll understand, right, when I don't call you about getting together for lunch? Pablo, is that you? Here, kitty. Here, boy. I know you're upset. Sometimes in nature these things happen. A bigger animal comes along and... Mom, I don't think an animal killed Pablo. I think... I think maybe the Campbell boy did it. Oh, I know you're upset. Allison... He was mad at me. He likes me, and... and I've kind of been avoiding him. So you think he killed your cat? Allison. And that's not the only thing. I've been having dreams again. You know this is crazy talk, and you know it upsets me, and it has nothing to do with the cat being torn apart by a dog or a coyote... Mom, I'm trying to tell you. I've had dreams about him in the future, doing horrible things to girls. Girls younger than me. Well, I-I... I got to tell you something. That says a lot more about you than it does him. Why would you dream about anyone doing anything to young girls? Well, you know who I blame for this? Mom, we're not talking about Grandma now. For filling your head full of this nonsense about dreams, about the future. It was bad enough I had to endure it growing up when I was under her roof. But now? Mom... You grandmother does not know the future. She does not have visions or dreams. She's crazy. Mom, what are you doing? I need you to listen. You're upset. Please. I just want you to take one of these pills and get some sleep. Mom, I need you to listen to me! No. I won't listen. Not when you're talking crazy. I don't want to listen to anything about dreams, about special feelings, about predictions. Are you gonna take one of these or not? IZZY: Hey. I'm so sorry about Pablo. Your mom told me. It's really awful. Anyway, I want you to know, I totally understand if you don't want to come with me today. What are you talking about? To the science fair. Oh. Right. I mean, I... I know you're upset. I know you're depressed, so... relax. We don't have to go. We can just stay here. Besides, we don't want to risk running into your future husband accidentally and messing up everything that's supposed to happen in the future, and completely screwing up the balance of nature, and changing the course of human development on the planet Earth. Actually... I think I want to go. IZZY: Okay.</i> I'm totally confused. Now we're looking for Mr. Goodhair? Yeah. Don't you see? He's part of the future I've been dreaming. In my dreams, I don't meet him until college, unless right now, right here, I make it a point to meet him. (camera shutter clicking) I change the future. And then maybe, just... just maybe, all the bad things I've been dreaming about won't happen. Allison? You are in dire need of psychological help, or, I don't know, a... conk on the noggin with a big hammer or something. You're not gonna meet this Joe guy today. He's not in here. He's in there. He doesn't exist. Well, we'll just see, won't we? (laughing): Oh! Come here for a second. How would you pronounce that name? Joseph Duboys? Yoseph Dew-bwa? I think this is it. I think this is his. Looks like the future's safe. Did you see that? What are you guys looking at? Hey. You know, I've been looking for you two everywhere. What are you doing here? I don't know. Um, it was kind of a... a spur-of-the-moment thing. You know, I knew this was where you really wanted to be, so I thought, if Allison wants to go to the science fair, then, you know, the hell with the comic book convention. That's so sweet. So, you guys want to grab some lunch after? I'm, uh... I'm buying. No. I just... I really want to go home after. Oh. I guess, um, you didn't hear. Pablo was killed last night. In her yard. Like, a dog or something. Oh, that's terrible. That's terrible. Allison, I am so sorry. This is really awful. Allison... IZZY: Allison, what are you doing? It's okay. She's just... She's-She's upset. You stay away from me. I know all about you. I know who you are. IZZY: Allison, what's wrong with you? Nothing. She's upset. That's all. She just doesn't know what she's talking about. I have to go. I have to go home. I need to be by myself for a while. SCANLON: Do you know why you're here?</i> Because there's been a screw-up somewhere. Because somebody, someplace has made a mistake. SCANLON: Well, should that turn out to be the case, then you're absolutely within your rights to file a complaint th the proper authorities. But I suspect you'll be a little busy finding yourself a good defense attorney. What's this? Who are these people? ALLISON: These are the faces of the seven young girls that you raped but chose not to kill. The seven that we know about. The seven that we can prove. You believe this? You believe that I raped all these girls? I believe in science, Stephen, and the science says you did it. SCANLON: Not only were we able to make a DNA match, but no matter what part of the country these abductions and rapes occurred in, it coincided with your arrival and departure from that region. ALLISON: It's just a matter of time. We're faxing your photograph to the local police in each jurisdiction. These girls will identify you. They will testify. But that's the least of your problems, because we're charging you with the murder of Nancy Claymore. I see. And... what is it you want from me? A confession would be nice. It would save us the effort and the expense involved in a trial. I am authorized to offer you life without the possibility of parole. My goodness. Your mom must be awfully proud of you. I'm trying to help you avoid the death penalty. Again? Do you remember... the day your Mom had you bring some cookies over to my house? Of course you don't. It wasn't a particularly important day for you. All you did was walk over to the new neighbors' house and knock on the front door. Okay... But, see, what you didn't know was that right before you knocked on that door... I had a gun in my mouth. And I was determined to kill myself. I remember it so clearly. Across the street.. the McElroys were getting ready for their family reunion. And down the block, some guy was washing his car and he had his car radio blasting "Sister Christian." My dad had just kicked the crap out of me for leaving a jar of jelly out on the counter overnight. So I sat down on the couch. I put one of his precious antique revolvers in my mouth, and then... there was a knock on the door. And who did I find standing on my doorstep... but the girl next door... Allison Rolen. My secret crush. And wonder of wonders we talked, and... started thinking that maybe she likes me. And maybe life is worth living after all. I need a confession, Stephen. Are you prepared to do that? Do I call a stenographer? Or do I call my boss and tell him that we are having a trial? You hear that knock? Isn't she something? She's going to save my life again. Hey. What's going on? What did he do to you? I don't know... he just... one minute we were just talking, and then... he tried to kiss me... and then he was... on top of me and... I said, "No," and then... he got really angry. Izzy, did he hurt you? No. No. We heard his dad come home. And then he let go of me, and I just ran out the back door and I came over here. (dog barking) I just... I can't let my mom see me like this. Can I come in? Please? Can I just...? Of course, you can. Sure. Come on. (sobbing): Allie... I don't know what would have happened if his dad hadn't come hom I really don't. Yeah, well... I do. I know. Can I throw these out somewhere? I don't want to take a chance on my mom seeing them. Yeah, sure. I really think we need to tell someone. Tell them what? Tell 'em... that he scared me? That he's a jerk? Last night, you said that... Yeah. Well... Last night I was upset. Today I see that I'm fine and that nothing really happened. Not really. But Izzy... what if you knew he was going to do it again? But worse. What if you knew other girls were going to get hurt? Is this dream talk again? Listen to me. I don't know anything about the future, Allison, and neither do you. This is about me. This is about something that really happened to me. And that means I get to decide what to do about it. I'm sorry. Promise me. Promise me you won't tell anyone about this. Allison, promise me. And promise me we'll never talk about this again. Izzy... Promise me! I promise. Okay. Well, I guess I better go. Izzy? This is it, isn't it? We're not gonna be friends after this, are we? Why are you saying that? Isn't there enough bad already? Why do you say that? I don't know. It's just a feeling I have. Oh, good, you're here. Uh, Stacey called in sick-- lazy, hung-over tramp-- so I have to cover her shift. And, uh, can you bring these cookies over to the Campbells' house along with that note inviting Mr. Campbell over for dinner next week? Mom, the last place in the world I want to go is the Campbell house. Why, did you and Stephen have a fight? No. What's the problem, then? I can't talk about it, but I'm not going over there. I'm asking you, please. No. I don't ask for much from you. Tips are lousy, your dad's child-support payment is late, and the car needs new brake pads I can't pay for. So do this one thing for me, okay, without giving me any attitude. Okay. I talked to the police. He shot himself. I'm so sorry, honey, but he's dead. I'm-I'm... I'm sorry. I know you cared about him. I did. I really did. I know. Would you like me to give you something... help you sleep? Actually, I'm... I'm kinda scared to dream. That's silly. The thing a person needs most at a time like this is sleep. And the thing a person needs to do the most is forget. Bye! Bye, Mom! Oh, I forgot. I'm supposed to stay after school and work with my new lab partner, so can you pick me up at 4:30? Well, this is a heck of a time to mention it, Ariel. I have the meeting this afternoon. I know. I'm sorry. Um... wait. Nancy! Do you think your mom could drop me at home after we're done working? Sure, I guess that'd be okay. Mom, this is Nancy Claymore. She just started here this week. Hi, Mrs. Dubois. So her mom's gonna drop me at home later, okay? Well, sure, that's okay. Nancy, you look so familiar. Have we met before?
