talk about this outside. They ran some tests while you were unconscious. Um... I need to talk to you about what they found. A brain tumor. I know. - You're supposed to be in surgery right now. - Yeah, I know. I can't have that surgery. What did you just say? I can't have it. At least not now. It's going to take away my dreams, Joe. It's going to take away my gift. Your wife had a stroke shortly before surgery. We went ahead with the procedure anyway. But now she's showing no signs of consciousness. It is impossible to predict when or even... if she will ever come out of her comatose state. It's time, Mr. Dubois. She's been unresponsive for months. She can't even breathe on her own. It's not living, Mr. Dubois. It's not life. I called the insurance people again. They're not going to change their minds... - and the hospital... - I know. I understand. Um... I have no choice. I can't afford to keep her alive, so... Okay. Okay. Do what you... You do what you need to do. Are you going to get that? - I could use a hand here. - Yeah. Okay. Here you go. How did you sleep? Like a rock again. And you? Fine. So, what is that? 36 days now? Without a dream? Not counting my three months in a coma. It's gone, Joe. That surgery took it all away. No dreams. No nothing. Just... sleep. :::   Timecodes  -  gius   ::: - Bridgette! - You hear that? Sounds like someone just stepped on a cat. Listen to me, you child of Sasquatch. The key to Mom's car is gone. Okay? It was in my purse, and now it's not there, and since you're the only one... around here who goes into my purse, tell me what you did with it. I have a spoon, and I'm not afraid to use it. Okay, you know what? Look. You might not like going to school, but Marie and I do. So give me the key. Mom! Dad! What's going on? Hey. I'm supposed to get everybody to school and I can't find the key to your car. Well, don't look at me. I haven't driven that car in four and a half months. Where did you put it? I always leave it in my purse, and now it's not there. And I know who took it. She's always going through my purse and stealing my money and my gum. Are you just going to let her ruin my good name like that? All right, well, you're just going to have to borrow Daddy's car. I'm sure that my key will show up. It's got to turn up somewhere. Somebody mention my name? Can Ariel borrow you car to get everyone to school? Well, wait a second. I'm speaking at that conference in Scottsdale. I need my car. Well, can you drop them off on your way? Yeah. Okay, I suppose. Can you pick them up and bring them home? Yeah. Why not? I wish I was an only child. You know, I'm going to make it my business to find that key. It's got to be around here somewhere. Hey, why don't you make it your business to rest? Huh? That should be your priority. Resting. That and doing your exercises. You've been in a coma for three months. Now you're finally back home for a month. And you're acting like everything's back to normal. Well, everything is back to normal. On the left side of my body anyway. Well, when you find that key... I expect a full apology from you-know-who. Five minutes, we're leaving, Bridge. Five minutes. Yeah. More hospital bills? Hospital. Therapy. More hospital. - I think I have to get a job. - You had a job in San Diego. You gave it up so you could take care of me. I think maybe it's time to get another one. Hey, aren't you the guy who had that brilliant idea for that solar cell thingamajiggy? Yeah. Majiggy is actually my middle name. Ah. Well, see? There. There you go. You have a job. Thinking up brilliant things. What? You don't think the world needs more brilliant things? - I'm going to get the kids to school. - You do that. I'm going to find that key. Hey, forget the key. I'll find the key tomorrow. Here goes nothing. Allison, stop. Allison, stop. Allison, stop. You know, I think to myself, I want my hand to open. And it just doesn't. And I wait. It's like it has a mind of its own. But you managed to drive here. I steer with my left hand. I drove with my left foot. Joe doesn't know. He doesn't... He doesn't know I'm here, either. Okay. Sir. Before my surgery, I had a dream. It was one of the last dreams that I ever had, and... you came to me. You offered me a job. Even though I was no longer dreaming, even though I no longer had my gift. - Allison, you... - Sir. Please. This illness... This tumor... It has cost my family a fortune. Joe had to stop doing what he was doing in San Diego. And they gave him some money, but it wasn't like he was in any position to bargain. And he's supposed to make some money from the royalties from his invention... when they start selling it, but that's- that's a couple years off. So I was wondering... if maybe I could answer phones or I could... I could do filing. Allison, stop. Okay, if the phone is ringing and you want to answer it, be my guest. If you see something lying around and you want to file it, I promise not to complain. But even before I knew about your dreams, you were hired to work here as a paralegal. And a damn fine one, as I recall. And I'm not about to hire you back now as anything less. Is that a yes? It's going to take me a minute or two to find the money, and it won't be full-time. I- I don't think I could handle full-time. But yes, that's a yes. Thank you, sir. You won't regret it. Welcome back. Our 11:00's in the conference. What do we have here? Come on. If you're giving out hugs... I had no idea you were out and about. - How you doing? - Ah, you know. I have my good days. I got my bad days. I got my good side. I got my bad side. The good news is my bad side's getting better... and my good days mostly outweigh my bad. How is Lynn and little Lee? Both my ladies are doing great. Thanks. Wait a second. Is Allison, uh, here for the meeting? I don't know. That's, uh... That's an interesting thought. You free? Would you care to sit in on something? Hey, as long as it doesn't involve physical therapy, I'm in. After you, Dr. House. There's no bigger Suns supporter than me.</i> No bigger fan in the Phoenix metro area.</i> But I'd be lying if I said I was happy about this latest round of trades.</i> Fibbing if I told you that I thought it was good for anyone...</i> except some accountant who's working in the Suns' back office.</i> And good accounting rarely makes for good basketball.</i> I'm Sophie Cullen, and I'm your girl in the locker room.</i> See what I'm talking about? He's stalking her. He's stalking her with his camera. Stalking us. These are public streets, Dan. And filming a newscast off your television might be a little strange... - but I don't think it's illegal. - Wait. You get the idea. How many of these DVDs did Miss Cullen receive? Half dozen or so. But as you can see, he's getting more brazen. I mean, he's no longer just videotaping her in the streets. He's pursuing her in stores and restaurants. He's peeping. I mean, both of us fear it's only a matter of time before he shows up at her door. And I won't lie to you. It's taking its toll on both of us. I'm sorry. I'm confused about the relationship. Uh, you're the station manager? Owner. Dan-- Mr. Taper owns several television stations. Yeah, a couple of newspapers, too. You know anyone who wants to buy one? In answer to your question, Miss Cohen is my employee. She's also my wife. Has been for a little over a year. This fellow, we know where he lives. We know who he is. That's his name and address. I really feel we're dealing with some form of mental illness here... and I just think it would be helpful before something gets out of hand... before something horrible happens, if someone from this office... somebody from the police department could pay this fellow a visit... put him on notice, make it clear to him he's being watched. I got a pretty full slate today, but I'd be happy to pay him a visit tomorrow. You back on the clock? Should I pick you up in the morning? Well, I don't know. Am I back on the clock tomorrow? - Hey. - Hey. Don't look now, but Marie got pinned. - What's that? - Pinned. Marie got pinned. When they give you something... and they really want your parents to see it, they pin it to you. Daddy, take it off. Career Day is tomorrow? Yup, we're "D"s. "A" through "D" is tomorrow. Apparently, the other parents found out last week. I'm guessing that somebody kept forgetting to give us the flyer. Marie! Okay, so who's gonna go? Which one of us is gonna do it? Interesting question, given that neither of us have jobs. Well, actually, I need to talk to you about that after dinner. I don't know which infuriates me more: that you went ahead and did this without even bothering to discuss it with me... or that you drove there when half your body still doesn't work. Well, I didn't think it was important to discuss it with you... because honestly, I thought it was very unlikely that he would offer me anything. Why? He likes you. You worked there for years. Why wouldn't he want you back? Okay, well, let's start with the fact that I can no longer do that... clever little parlor trick that he used to find so useful. And like you said, half my body doesn't work. This is not how it's supposed to go. You should be devoting your time... to getting better, building your health. I should be the one that gets a job, not you. Honey, we have been through this. You have a job. You're an inventor. You just need a little time and a little freedom. And I want to do this for you. I want to give this to you. Haven't you sacrificed enough already? No. It's not a sacrifice when it's about you. And I'm worried about your health. Honey, when I was at work, I felt great, amazing. Almost, almost like I was normal. You know, it's only gonna start off part-time. And for tomorrow at least, Lee's gonna give me a ride. Tomorrow? Uh-huh. Well, I guess we know who's going to Marie's class. Honey... watch this. Come on. Very impressive. Not only that, when I was at work today... I felt this, this little flicker in my head. - Well, I don't like the sound of that. - No, no, no, it was good. It was like seeing a teeny, tiny piece of the future. Like seeing a sliver of something that's gonna happen. It was Devalos, and he kept saying something to me over and over again. And then it stopped. And then he actually said it. Okay. Well, it felt like it was coming from the same place in my dreams... and the things I used to be able to do came from. Like maybe it's... maybe it's healing. Maybe it's coming back. Well, you don't look pleased. I guess I was just getting used to the idea of this, this new you. You don't sound like you like the old me very much. Come on. That's not fair. You didn't like the old you very much either. That thing you're calling a gift? It brought an awful lot of darkness with it... to you, to me, to everyone in this house. Can you blame me for not missing it? Can you blame me for maybe hoping that's the one part of you that doesn't heal? Very impressive. Anything else? Any other part of you that hasn't wiggled in a while... that's suddenly come to life? Nope. Yeah, well, that's plenty enough for me. Peter Winant? I'm Detective Lee Scanlon. This is my colleague Allison Dubois. We were hoping you had a few minutes to talk. About time you folks came around. Every day I have to paint six or seven doors... and every night those taggers come back. My phone starts ringing every morning at 7:00 am... tenants calling with work orders. I can show you what they look like. I don't have any names or anything... Actually, Mr. Winant, the tagging and whatnot... that's not why we're here. We're here to talk to you about Sophie Cullen. Sophie? You've been watching her... following her, recording her... making DVDs and sending them to her. She's very disturbed by it, Mr. Winant. I doubt that. Did she come to you? Did she complain? No. Her husband did. So I guess he finally knows. - Knows what? - About us. About me and Sophie. About our love. I can't imagine what he must be feeling. And what a way to find out. I wonder which ones he saw. I'm sorry. I'm not sure I'm following. Are you trying to tell us that Ms. Cullen knows you? Knows of you? I mean, you know, as anything other than a fan? I'm trying to tell you that we're lovers. Why do you look so shocked? Why does it strike you as incongruous that... two people who look so different... who seem so different would be drawn to one another? Why do you assume we have nothing in common? You do understand, Mr. Winant, that I'm gonna have to go back... to Ms. Cullen to corroborate that her version of your, uh... friendship is the same as yours. And if it isn't, I'm putting you on notice. We know who you are. We know where you live. You so much as cross the street against the light in pursuit of Ms. Cullen... you're going to jail. She worships me... and I her. The best thing about being an inventor? Um, wow, that's a tough one. I guess it would have to be that you can, you can do your job anywhere. I mean, you know, at home, in your car, on a plane. As long as you remember to bring your brain... the whole world is your office. Does anybody else have a...? Yeah, sure, go ahead. It sounds like a great job. Yeah, it is. It's a great job. But what happens if you never have another idea? Excuse me? Well, you said an inventor only gets paid when he has an idea. So, what if you never have another idea? Well, but I will. Okay. But... what if you don't? But I will. - Hi. Let's go to bed. - Uh, yeah, in a minute. I'm just, you know, trying to make myself jump-start some ideas. Can you do that? Can you make yourself have an idea? Uh, I don't know. But based on the evidence at hand, I tend to think not. Okay. Well, then let's go to bed. Why bother spinning your wheels? Pick it up in the morning. I don't know. I guess I'm just worried that I'm never going to have another idea. But you will. But what if I don't? Most people don't have a single world-class idea... in their entire lives. And I had one. Do you know how lucky that makes me? You're driving yourself crazy. You're driving me crazy. It's 10:00. Let's go to bed. 911 how can I help you? Please, please, please come. I'm hurt. Ma'am I can hardly hear you. He broke in. He raped me. He... he stabbed me. What is your location? And he- he killed my husband. What if I don't? Most people don't have a single world-class idea... in their entire lives. And I had one. Do you know how lucky that makes me? Yeah, hello. Yeah, she's right here, Detective. Something's happened. No, tell them I already know what happened. Peter Winant broke into Sophie Cullen's home. He killed her husband, stabbed her and raped her. Wait a second. How can you know that? You don't dream anymore. We haven't even been to bed yet. Well, I hate to disappoint you, but that's all about to change. Well, it started after we left the dining room. Then we went to bed. But we didn't go to bed. We haven't gone to bed. Not yet. Well, at least I haven't. I'm just trying to explain what this experience was like... what it felt like. So, I had a dream. In it, I saw everything that Scanlon just said happened. Then I woke up and I realized none of it had happened-- the sleeping, the dreaming. That I was still standing in the dining room with you. Look... honey... I think this part of my body-- it's trying to heal. It's trying to figure out how to work... just like the right side of my body is. Okay. But hold on a second. So, before you had the operation, you had a dream. You dreamt that they'd operate on your brain and then your gift would disappear. Now you're telling me that that dream was wrong? That- that all the dreams you had before the operation-- they were wrong? They were wrong. I didn't have the exact operation that I dreamt about. I delayed that. Remember? That's why they couldn't cut out the whole tumor out of my head. Maybe that's why. It's been happening for a few days-- this- this little flickering. - You didn't tell me. - I tried to. You didn't react very well. Well, hold on a second. When was this? It was never. It... it was going to happen. I didn't allow it to. Just like I saw a dream I know I'm going to have. I didn't want to have this conversation. Okay, I see. So... you made this decision based not on something that I did... but on something that you believe that I was going to do... which, by the way, I have not actually done yet. Yeah, that's about right. Okay, well, thanks for giving me the benefit of the doubt. And, uh, do me a favor. When you actually have this dream... that you already know you're gonna have, don't bother waking me up. We both already know that I'll react badly. I didn't see him at first as much as I, um... felt him. His bigness, his breath. I mean, I was dead asleep, and it was dark, and all of the sudden... I'm aware that there's someone tearing at me. And I knew where I was. I knew... I knew I was in my bedroom. And I also knew that my husband wasn't there 'cause I couldn't feel him. I couldn't smell him. So... I- I started screaming for him. I mean, while there's this other person pulling at me and... and grunting at me. His hand was over my mouth, and I just remember... shutting my eyes. I thought he was gonna break me. And somewhere in there... I guess I blacked out. And... when I came to, he was gone. My stomach-- the left side was throbbing. That's when I saw the blood and realized he had stabbed me. I tried to get up... but I couldn't, so I- I dragged myself... across the floor, out of the bedroom and went looking for Dan. I found him in the kitchen. But at some point, you did get a look at him? Yeah. I was able to turn around for just a moment. He looked like a rhino. Like an angry rhino. He can't be that hard to find, a creature like that. He can't. He can't be that hard to find. We'll find him. But until we do... you'll have two police outside your door 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Everything she just told us in there, I saw it, Lee. I saw it the other day when we were visiting that monster. - What are you talking about? - I saw them making love. At least I thought that's what I saw. I- I thought I was seeing some kind of fantasy in his head... but I guess I was just seeing him rape her. And I could've stopped it, Lee. We could've stopped it. Wait a second. First of all, you weren't even sure you were psychic yesterday. Second of all, how could you have stopped it? You can't lock someone up for something he hasn't done yet. Especially someone with an absolutely clean record like that guy has. I don't care. - Hi. Joe Dubois, right? - Yeah. I'm Drew Campbell. We met at the kindergarten play last year... the four food group thing. Oh, right. Okay. Yeah, my boy got a real kick out of your career day presentation. He came home, told me all about it. All about that solar cell you built. He did? I'm a corporate recruiter. A headhunter. I work with all the major engineering firms in the Southwest. I could sell the hell out of you. That's not what I read in the papers. What I read in the papers is that... when it comes to jobs, no one's hiring. I'm just saying that companies focusing on green technology... are pretty flush with stimulus money right now. - All of them are hiring. - Okay, if you say so. But my background is in- in aeronautics. I don't know anything about doing engineering. Joe, you built a solar cell. It doesn't get much greener than that. Hey, limo? Somebody call for a limo? Now, that is what I call service. Do you think the restrooms are still open in there? Guess so. Two minutes. Well, that is not what I call service. She made a fool out of me. Even now, she's laughing at me. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Joe said I could find you here. - What's going on? - Peter Winant. About a half hour ago, he tried to force his way into Sophie Cullen's hospital room. One of the officers we had stationed there ordered him to freeze; Winant went after him. The other officer put one in his neck, two in his back. Hey, penny for your thoughts. I'm not sure you would get your money's worth. Just thinking about how random life is. One day there's this couple, you know, happy, they're living their life. And this other guy comes along... kills the husband, tortures the wife. Random. Now he's dead, too. Completely random. Yeah. Hey, speaking of random, this guy came up to me in school. Uh, his kid told him about my presentation on career day. Turns out, he thinks he may have a job for me. W- What are you talking about? We've been through this. There are no jobs. Not in aeronautics, not in Phoenix. Besides, you're not looking for a job. I don't know. I might be. You know, I miss seeing people every day. I mean, people other than my kids in the rearview mirror... when I take them to school. I miss drinking coffee that I didn't have to make myself. I- I can't believe I'm saying this, but I miss commuting a little, you know? I miss being by myself and listening to the radio. I do. I miss it. I miss working for someone. I miss having a job. Okay, well, maybe you should call this magic man, this man... who knows about all these magic jobs that no one else knows about. They're green jobs. Turns out I'm green engineer, and I didn't even know it. I don't care what color engineer you are... as long as you're a happy engineer. Hey. That's not all for you, you know. I don't want to leave. - Why do I have to leave? - Because I'm married. And my husband's gonna be home soon and because... you know the answer. What if I just stay? What if I just don't leave and we wait for him to get home? And then he knows. And then nothing will matter and then we can get on with it. It's not that easy, Peter. I've explained this to you. I need a job. You're gonna have to give me time to find work... at another station before we can tell anyone. Okay? It's hard to wait. I... I want to spend a whole night with you. I want to wake up with you. I want that too. Soon, my love. I promise. You sit tight. I'll be right back. You're going home today? Yeah, they're letting me leave in a couple hours. The nurses showed me how to dress my wounds last night. That's amazing. Two stab wounds and no lasting damage. Well, I don't know. You haven't seen the two scars... I'm going to be left with for the rest of my life. But still. I mean, no major organs struck. No nerves severed. It's almost as if whoever did this... was determined to do as little damage as possible. Excuse me? "Whoever did this?" Peter Winant did this. He killed my husband and he tried to kill me. If you say so. Well, wait a minute. Who doesn't say so? I don't know. I just know that Peter thinks you made a fool out of him. Peter thinks that... You're that Mrs. Dubois. I hadn't put it together. Well, little does he know he's just the tip of the iceberg. Yes, you made a fool out of Peter. You made a fool out of your husband. You're making a fool out of the whole justice system. I have no idea what you're talking about. He must have been thrilled the day you answered him. The day you reached out. How did it start? Did he send you a mash-up of yourself on television? And what, what did his face look like when you agreed to meet with him? Now that, that's a DVD I'd like to see. How about when you slept with him? Or when you told him that you loved him? What, no- no recording of that? What seems to be the problem, Ms. Cullen? Could you send somebody by, please? How about when you stabbed yourself? Could you please not block the door? There's a nurse that's coming here any minute. What about when you stabbed your husband to death? No footage of that either? It's funny. I don't see that police detective you came here with the other day. Could it be that this visit isn't official business? That what you're doing right now amounts to nothing more than harassment? Isn't this the moment that you're gonna remind me... what a wealthy woman you are now and how many television stations... and newspapers you own and how you employ tens of attorneys... all of whom you're going to sic on me if I don't leave this very minute? Well, don't worry. I'm leaving. But you'll be seeing me. - Tell me you're done. - I'm not done. You're not done, meaning, uh, I have more to look at? Or you're not done 'cause you haven't found what you want to find... even though you've already looked at everything ten times? I'm not done yet. Come on, Allison. We've already been here for three hours. This joint's the size of a shoe box. If you don't see it, it isn't here. It's got to be. I just know it. I can feel it. They were involved. I can smell it. Come to your senses. There's no way that guy... and that girl were... what was the word you used? - Involved. - Involved. Anywhere other than in his head. You find a souvenir pair of her panties? Under the mattress? Hidden in the closet? Come on, you know that's what you're gonna need to make the case. How about a love letter? You don't even have a photograph with the two of them in it 'cause they weren't together. I told you I'm not done yet. Well, I'm done and I'm your ride. Come on. Look at that door. Not only are we not going to clear his name... we didn't even try to find the little turds... who were making his life miserable by doing this. It's kind of a moot point at this juncture, Allison. Lee, let's go back inside, look at the security tape... and see if we can ID them. - What are you talking about? - The taggers-- they're on the tape. Anyone around this apartment would be on that tape. Oh, my God, Lee... Ah, Miss Cullen, thank you for joining us. You're just in time. We were about to watch some television. Should I have brought a lawyer? If you're asking me if you're about to be charged with anything, absolutely not. We simply want to give you a progress report on the investigation into your husband's death. - Please. - But we know who killed my husband. It was the same man who attacked me, raped me. And he's dead, so there's nothing to investigate. Are you referring to your stalker? The man you told us you never saw until the night he broke into your home? That's right. Well, what if we were to tell you we had surveillance footage of you... making your way into and out of Peter's apartment on two different evenings... after your late newscast? - Surveillance footage? - There was a problem with vandals. Peter was determined to catch them. He set up security cameras. He had a monitor right there in his apartment. I'm guessing he must have shut it off... when he was entertaining you or else you would've seen it. Even though it was night... even though you were wearing sunglasses, I'm quite sure... that a jury will have no problem believing it's you. And what will that prove? It'll prove you're a liar, for one thing. A liar... perhaps... but not a killer. You're quite right about that, Miss Cullen. We have no proof that you took your husband's life, not yet. But I did take the liberty of sending this footage to every news outlet in the city... including, by the way, the one that you own or... owned. Apparently, it's going to be a huge story. A public figure in an adulterous relationship with the man she claimed to be her stalker? We also made sure that your late husband's family got to see the footage. They had some interesting things to say. They told us that you and your late husband signed prenuptial agreements. And it turns out that even the appearance of an adulterous relationship... is enough to render those agreements null and void. By the way, they asked me to ask you to do them the courtesy of skipping the funeral. They said there will be plenty of time to catch up... when they see you in court to contest the estate. Is there anything else? Am I free to go? You can go. But I'm not sure how, uh, free you'll feel. I'm reopening the investigation into your husband's death. You're the main suspect. Thanks for coming in. It's good to have you back. It's good to be here. I don't know. I have a good feeling about this guy. I just kind of trust him. Thank you, sweetie. And he says he's already got a couple interviews set up for me. Well, if you're sure that's what you want. Thanks, honey. Well, I'm not sure that it's what I want. But I mean, nobody's offered me a job yet. Um, but when they do, if they do, I suppose I could... I could still always turn it down. I suppose so. He wants me to get a haircut. Before the first interview. He says he thinks it might be, uh, helpful. - Wow, are you actually going to do it? - Yeah, I think he's probably right. Do you even know where to get one, Daddy? Bridgette... For what it's worth, I like the idea. Get the person who cut Mommy's. I'm not going to the hospital to get a haircut. - You silly billy!
