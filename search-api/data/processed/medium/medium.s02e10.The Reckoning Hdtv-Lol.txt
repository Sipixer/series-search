Toby! Stop! Cock-a-doodle-do. Cock-a-doodle who? Never mind. I take that back. It's way too early for this kind of talk. Do you know that it's barely 5:00? I know. Is that a grocery list? Kind of. It's a list of things Ariel thinks she needs for her slumber party tomorrow night. Rice cakes, sunflower seeds? What? Ariel's trying to make friends with this girl named Celeste who is allergic to gluten. This is why you're up so early? No. I hit a girl with my car. In a dream. Okay. Was anyone else with you? No. Was it nighttime, daytime? It was night. Any idea where the street might have been? What do you mean? Like a name? A name would be good. Well, I remember I felt like it was that area near the hospital where all those houses are. Okay, this is easy. I'm glad you feel so relieved. Let's just agree, from now until the end of time, that you don't drive alone at night in that area by the hospital where the houses are. What? You're upset? I'm just frustrated. That's all. Why? We've been at this for a while now. And? All this skepticism. This isn't skepticism. This is the exact opposite of skepticism. This is absolute conviction followed by-- and this is the important part-- by completely logical plan of action. Really? Truly. It's like that joke. The guy walks in to the doctor's office, he says, "Hey, Doc, "my arm hurts when I raise it like this." And the doctor says, "Fine. Don't raise it like that." We can't stop the night from coming, we can't stop the girl from stepping out into the road. But if you're not in the road in your car, you're not gonna hit her. Allison, smile, for God's sake. This is a tragedy we can absolutely avoid. This is a gift. Now I say we celebrate... back in bed. Would you like me to check your oil? You're kidding me. You guys still do that? Well, you're at the full service island, Miss. Damn it. So would you like me to check something? I don't know, no. Oh, wait a second. Morning. Morning. I'm not sure if you're even open yet, but, uh, I was just hoping to get a cup of coffee while they put in a new headlight for me across the street. Yeah, right this way. Stop it. Thank you. James? James! Nadine. What are you doing? Did you call the broker? No, I did not call the broker. It just did it again in the bathroom. Nadine. There's no water and the lights flickered on and off. It is an old house. There's water now. There's water. I want to move. Nadine, please. I can't live like this, James. I just... I can't. I think I need to tell someone. Tell someone what exactly? Tell someone what? Tell someone what? Tell someone what?! What?! Here you go. Oh, thank you. Pardon me. I don't mean to trouble you, but would you mind if I stole some of your artificial sweetener? Excuse me? Sweetener. I don't have any at my table. Thank you. Sure. Was there something else? Are you all right? I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry. It's just... You know what? In case you change your mind. The District Attorney's office? Crying in public against the law? No, no, of course not. I'm sorry. You're trying to be nice, and I'm not playing along. Let me pay for your coffee. No, no, no. You don't have to do that. But I'd like to. Well, it's my birthday in a couple of days. I'd like to do something nice for somebody. Enjoy your coffee. Try not to trip on the sugar when you sit back down. All I'm saying is I should have gotten her name, that's all. It was stupid of me. What would you have done if you had gotten her name? I don't know. Run it through the computer at work. See if there was ever a police report, see if she ever filed a restraining order. Did you get tofu? I got it. Tofu? Celeste likes it on her pizza. Yum. Who's this Celeste? I don't remember you ever having mentioned her before. She's a new girl at school. Her family just moved here from New York. I really like her. She's traveled everywhere and knows everything about everything. Hello? Allison, it's Lee Scanlon. Did I wake you? It's okay. Do you know somebody named Nadine Massey? Nadine Massey. No, never heard of her. She's not a friend of yours, someone you met through work, maybe? I don't think so. Any idea why she might have your business card? Wait, yeah, I might have met her yesterday. What's going on? Is she okay? "Okay" is not an adjective I'd use, no. So their names are Hannah, Celeste and Ashley. No, I know Hannah. They're not due here till 3:00, and I will absolutely be back before then, so don't worry. I believe you. I need to know if it's her. No, I know. Like I was supposed to meet her, like I was supposed to help her, and I didn't. Al, give yourself a break. You only met this woman for five minutes. I know. Husband says he fell asleep on the sofa watching television. When he woke up around 3:00 and went to the bedroom, he found his wife dead on the floor. Gunshot wound to the right temple. He didn't hear the gunshot? That's what he says. Terrace doors were open, but there's no sign of an intruder. The gun was on the floor next to her. Husband says that he kept it in the bedroom safe. Guy says he loved his wife like the dickens. That she was admittedly the high-strung type, prone to hysteria. He seems devastated but not all that surprised she decided to end it all. You don't seem so convinced. I don't know. I guess I'm a little surprised she'd choose to use a gun when there's enough tranquilizers in the house to take down Shamu. Want to hear something really strange? The last few days, she actually seemed happy. Happy? Well... I mean, happier than she'd been... in a long time. At least it seemed that way to me. I don't know. Maybe it was actually relief. Making the decision... knowing... that it'll all be over soon. I appreciate you taking the time to speak with us. May have to speak with you again in the next few days. By all means, Detective. Daddy, what beats two pairs? Uh, three of a kind. Hey, hey, you. Who wants popcorn? Oh, I do, I do, I do! - Want popcorn? - Yeah. Thank you very much. Daddy, what beats three of a kind? A full house. I see your melon. I'll raise you a cherry. Wait, you've got a full house? I quit. Fold, Celeste. You mean you fold. Yeah, I fold, too. Okay, uh, anybody else need anything? Everybody okay? No, we're okay. All right. So we're heading back to the bedroom for a hot game of Hungry Hungry Hippos. Hungry Hungry Hippos! Um, holler if you need me to float you a loan. Yes, Daddy. Thanks, Mr. Dubois. This is no fun. You always win. Well, I'm sorry. I can't help it. She's just lucky. That's all. Well, I want to do something else, something fun. You don't have a swimming pool or an X-box or anything. Your house is no fun. Well, I'm sorry. It's okay. You can't help that you're boring. Well, how about we play... Tomorrows? Tomorrows? Oh, God, she's really good at this. Three of diamonds. That's a good card. A lucky card. There's a boy you like. Robert... Bobby... Bobby Soames? He'll call you tomorrow. Who's Bobby Soames? He's a friend of my brother's. He doesn't even go to our school. How did you know? I told you, she's really good at this. Do me. Do me. Okay. Five of spades. Not so lucky. What? Something's going to happento your left ankle. What are you talking about? Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. You knew about Bobby Soames. I'd stay off that ankle. Okay, my turn. Wait a second. I'm the new friend. I'm the guest. Do me again. The queen of hearts. I like that one. What's the matter? Tell me what it means. You're not going to tell me? It doesn't mean anything. Um, it just basically says that I can only give one fortune at a time. And that's it? What is that, like, a rule or something? That's no fun. I don't want to play this anymore. This is stupid. But what about my tomorrow? Girls, I'm home! That's my mom. She said she'd bring home some pizza and some movies. Hi. Sorry, honey. Did I wake you? No. I just can't sleep. Excited, huh? I guess. Everybody having a good time? Yeah. I don't know. Honey, you're not sorry you had everybody over, are you? No. Honey, I'm sure it's going a lot better than you think. I'm just sorry I wasn't here when everyone got here. That's okay. You had to work. 12 is hard. 38 is harder. That's why it's important to practice when you're 12. What's going on? Ariel is upset about something. Anything serious? Everything's serious when you're 12. I just felt badly I wasn't home earlier this afternoon. By the time I left that lady's house, rented the videos, went to the pizza place and waited for one gluten-free crust, please, headed home, it was already dark. And suddenly there's the hospital, so I panic. I turn around, and I take all the back roads home. Did you hit anyone? Not that I noticed. Then stop beating yourself up. I was here, and I did a magnificent job. You refuse to have a serious conversation with me. Shoot me; I'm in a good mood. Oh, that must be nice. Sorry, but I refuse to contribute to the celebration of everything that is wrong with Allison Dubois. Yes, our 12-year-old, after being allowed to stay up way past her bedtime with her three friends, and after eating enough food to choke a horse and drinking stuff which in other countries is probably used to take the paint off of airplanes, probably isn't feeling 100%, and I'm sure that that's your fault. That's not what I'm talking about. And some woman that you met completely by chance yesterday, and whose name you didn't even know until this morning, who was bound and determined to take her own life, took her own life, and I'm sure that that was your fault, too. Look, I know you're trying to cheer me up. And my personal favorite: a girl that you hit with your car in a dream-- which, by the way, means you didn't really hit her-- why don't you get a head start on that and get upset about that now rather than wait and see if and when it actually does happen? Are you through? No, I'm making a point. Yes, I'm in a good mood. Every loudmouthed girl in this house-- half of them are ours-- are finally asleep. Tomorrow is Sunday, which means that I don't have to go to work. And lastly... I don't know if you've noticed, but this whole damn place smells like s'mores. So, sorry, baby, I refuse to be depressed, and that means I refuse to let you be depressed, either. Wow, that's the same speech I just gave Ariel. See? Mediocre minds think alike. I think I need to tell someone. Tell someone what exactly? Tell someone what? Tell someone what?! Tell someone what?! What?! Never mind. James? James?! Please stop. Thank you. Did you ever see a dream walking? Well, I did Did you ever hear a dream talking? Well, I did. Did you ever have a dream thrill you? With "Will you be mine?" Did you ever see a dream dancing? Well, I did Did you ever see a dream romancing? James? Well, I did James! Make it stop! James! James! Nadine! Hey, you. Hey. Did you have a good class? Yeah. Can we just go, please? Okay, did you say good-bye to... Yes. Can we please just go? So, anybody in school say anything about your party? I don't know. I guess. Did they have fun? Did the girls have a good time? Yes, Mom. Everyone had fun. Now can we please not discuss it? Okay. At the slumber party, just for fun, I kind of started telling everyone their future. Okay. It was easy. I just thought things in my head and I... I said them out loud. And I knew the stuff I thought would make them like me. I knew Celeste would want to know that the boy she likes would call her. And then I started thinking that Ashley would sprain her ankle. Did you say anything? But then I thought something worse. About Ashley? About Celeste. She was older, like in high school, and she was in the hospital, and she was really, really sick. She had tubes going into her and she couldn't breathe, and there was a minister standing there... waiting. And it just made me so sad. Then I go to dance class, and Ashley sprains her ankle. And... Celeste told me about Bobby calling. Do you think this means that Celeste will get sick? Wait a minute. What did you say? I told her not to tell anybody. I said a lot of times that I'm wrong. There's nothing to do but wait, and she can always talk to me and I'd wait with her. That's it? Yeah. I was pretty proud of myself. I thought that was a pretty good answer. I'm not so sure it is. I'm not so sure that we don't owe this girl's parents a call. And say what? I don't know. "Take your kid to a doctor. Have her tested." We don't know that whatever she's suffering from in this vision isn't preventable. We don't know anything. This is Ariel we're talking about. Yeah, but she got the other two predictions right, didn't she? Excuse me? You want to call this girl's parents and say, "Hi. "My daughter Ariel Dubois had a vision that your daughter was fighting for her life in the hospital"? I don't know. Don't we have an obligation? We have an obligation to our daughter not to do or say anything that makes life as a 12-year-old girl any harder than it already is. And you calling this girl's parents and saying she has visions, I don't see how that's going to make life in the sixth grade any easier. Oh, man. Oh! Did I hear someone say Chinese? It's a beautiful night in Phoenix. The temperature is around 78 degrees, not a cloud in sight. For those of you that love good music, here's another pretty song coming at you. What day is it? ...this clock now seems so alive I can't give up 'Cause I can... Damn. And you and me And all of the people With nothing to do, Nothing to lose And it's you and me, And our love of people And I don't know why... Toby, stop! I can't keep my eyes off of you... Oh, honey, I need to watch the road. Happy Birthday to me Happy Birthday to you. Oh, hey, come on, baby. Let's wait till we get home, all right? I've got a surprise for you. I don't want to wait. I want to celebrate. Oh, I made a rhyme. Toby! Stop! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! What are you doing? What are you doing?! Stop the car. I had two martinis and an Irish coffee. What about you, Nadine? What? Do you want me to go to prison, Nadine? Do you want me to get locked up? Because we got smashed on your birthday and some girl ran right in front of our car? Our love of people And I don't know why... We have to call somebody. We have to, we have to tell someone. She'll get help. She's gonna be fine. So will we. Nothing to do... Okay. Sorry, sorry. Yeah, I remember this case. Melanie Davenport. Hit-and-run. You turn up something? I think the driver was James Massie. Nadine Massie's husband. I think she was in the car when it happened, and I think the guilt over what they did drove her to kill herself. I mean no disrespect, but does this theory come with any actual evidence? The only eyewitness to the accident was two blocks away and saw a dark four- door hit Melanie and then speed off. According to DMV records, in 2004, the Massies were driving a green ES. The paint found on Melanie's clothing matches the paint they used on the ES that year. But not just the ES. Not just the ES, no. Well, that's very thin, Lee. And do we know where the car is now? Well, according to the DMV, it was reported stolen. Don't tell me it happened the day after the accident? Two, actually. Report says it disappeared from a mall parking lot while Nadine Massie was Christmas shopping. My hunch? They drove it to a border town, left it at the curb with the keys in it. It was probably in 10,000 pieces in some Mexican chop shop by nightfall. Well, all this is fascinating, but it really falls under the heading of coincidence and speculation. I can't even bring in the guy for questioning based on this. Really? 'Cause I already called and asked him to come down. He's sitting in your conference room right now. What, to discuss his possible involvement in a year-old hit-and-run case? Yeah, I may have left that part out. You... um... you call friends, relatives, first you have to tell them, you know, that... that she's gone, and then, you have to... find a way to, um... you know, get to... how she left. We appreciate you coming down, Mr. Massie. We know how difficult this is for you and we want to bring this to as speedy a resolve as possible. Unfortunately, there was a firearm registered in your name that was involved with your late wife's death. I understand. You can ask me anything. I'm sorry. Bit of a cold. That's fine. I know that both the detective and Mrs. Dubois have asked you this, but do you think there was something specific that precipitated your late wife's desire to take her own life? I've racked my brain. I, um... Her birthday was coming up. But she was always pretty excited about that. You ever own a green 2004 ES, Mr. Massie? I did. Um, it was stolen. We have witnesses that possibly put it at the scene of a hit-and-run. Okay. Um... well, I mean it was stolen... a while ago. I think, uh, it's been almost a year now. We understand that, but this, this hit-and-run I'm referring to actually occurred a couple of days before that. Your wife's birthday, actually. 15-year-old girl, Melanie Davenport, was killed. She was running after her dog. The person who hit her just kept going. Didn't even call 911. Okay. So... the reason I'm here, I mean... what you're trying to tell me... You think that maybe my wife hit this girl in our car and never reported it? Well... Because... I mean, if that were true, it would certainly explain a lot of things. What things? Well, uh... Nadine's state of mind over this entire past year, for one. If this were true, and mind you, I'm not saying that this is, but... I can't even imagine what kind of... terrible guilt she must have been living with. I mean, it's no wonder she was so unstrung. Everyone's in bed. I lied and told them you'd sneak in later while they were asleep and give them kisses. It's not necessarily a lie. How do you know it's a lie? I'm a student of history. And history suggests that when you get in one of these moods, the kind where you end up laying here on the couch stewing in your inability to effect any real change, eventually you fall asleep and no one sees you till morning. It's not going to happen. I just need a little time for myself, okay? I had a very depressing day. Well, I wouldn't know. You haven't said three words to me since I got home. Here are the highlights: James Massie-- he completely sold out his poor dead wife today. He could have said he didn't know anything. He knows we can't prove he was there. But no, he had to go that extra step and offer up Nadine who is not in a position to defend herself. I'm sorry. I just have to get that out of my system. Well, I have something I have to get out of my system. I asked Ariel for Celeste's parents' names and phone number today. I'm a scientist. People don't fall suddenly ill. It happens gradually over time. And there are windows of opportunity in which to intervene. I think it's worth the risk and any possible hardship to say something. And I don't think I could live with myself if I didn't. I know. I'll see you in the morning. Don't worry. I'm not going to fall asleep out here. Ha. Ha. Ha. Did you ever see a dream romancing Well I did Did you ever see heaven right in your arms James! James! Nadine! Oh, God. Baby. What did you do? Oh... Don't worry, honey. I'm going to get you some help, okay? James. James. We have to tell. I can't go on. I can't live this way. What are you talking about? Tell who? The police. She'll never leave until we do. Did you ever see a dream walking? Well I did. Did you ever hear a dream talking?</i> Well I did. Did you ever have a dream...</i> Did you call them? Are they coming? They're coming. You're going to be fine. This was stupid, what I did. I don't want to die. I know. I just wanted it to stop. Shh. Will you stay with me? I will. I'll stay with you till they get here. Close your eyes, baby. It's all right. It's going to be just a few minutes. Shh. Allison? It's okay. It's just me. I need to get my wallet. I have to go for a drive. A drive? It's 2:00 in the morning. Where in the world are you going to drive to? I need to go to that street, the one near the hospital. This isn't over, not yet. I just had another dream. Well, fine, then get back in bed, dream some more. No, I can't. That dead girl, Melanie Davenport, I think she's trying to tell me something. You're not going to find her here. Melanie's fine. She's safe. She's where she's supposed to be finally. And how about you? Me? I'm still adjusting. Getting... used to the idea. Trying to accept what he did. You know, it took me almost 27 minutes to die. He sat beside me holding my hand for 27 minutes while I tried to hang on, listening for the sirens that never came. But I guess I had it coming. I should have come forward to the police and told them what we'd done. That's all that Melanie wanted. She never meant to hurt me. That day that you and I met in the restaurant-- she arranged that you know. And the business with your headlight? She was giving me a chance to confess, a chance to live, and I didn't take it. And now Melanie's parents will never know who took their child from them. And what happens to your husband? He had a chance, too. Today, with you, in the room, he had a chance, and he didn't take it. So now, I guess it's up to me. I don't understand. What are you going to do? Obviously, he's not afraid of ghosts. He's not afraid of flickering lights or music. But if someone, or something, was to blow out the pilot light in the old stove in our kitchen, and James were to have a cold, not smell the gas, let it fill the room and James were to light a cigarette... I wonder what those sirens are all about? Do you smell something? Don't forget to bring home those names and that phone number. I won't, Daddy. Okay. Why isn't Mommy up? I like the way she pours better. Mommy was out late last night doing some emergency work. Darn. Hello? Yes, this is her mother. Morning. What about Celeste? Uh, I already reminded her. Well, that was her mom just now. She was wondering if you could pick up Celeste's homework today because Celeste needs to go to New York for a couple of days. Why, what's going on? I guess she has a cousin, a spitting image of Celeste, only ten years older, and I guess she was just diagnosed with leukemia, so they're all going there to say good-bye. You know what? I'm not hungry anymore. I'm just going to go to my room. I owe that girl a conversation. I don't get it. What's going on? Why is everybody so serious? It's hard to explain. You'll see, the older you get. I'll be right back.
