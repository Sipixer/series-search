I was just looking for a store that was still open, that's all. Must be some headache. Can't even kiss your husband in the most beautiful city on Earth. This isn't right, Kent. It's springtime in Paris. We're in the same room we honeymooned in. Come on, maybe a little Chardonnay will put you in a better mood. To us. To us. JOE (groggily): You all right? What's going on? Were you dreaming again? An American couple in Paris... The wife ended up stabbing the husband through the hand with a corkscrew. I don't know what to tell you. I don't think 'em up. ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾ -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- ·­Òë£º¸öÈËID Ð£¶Ô£º¸öÈËID Ê±¼äÖá£º¹Ûº£ÎÀ</font> -==http://www.ragbear.com==- Æ¬ÃûMedium µÚ4¼¾µÚ3¼¯</font> BRIDGETTE: Three tenths... Two twelfths, whic really one sixth. Um... Can you give me a clue? It's a math problem, doofus. So? So, there are no clues in math. You either know the answer or you don't. Mommy, I don't like doing flash cards with Ariel. I'd rather do them with Daddy. Sorry, kiddo. Your dad is getting ready for a big job interview. It's your sister or nothing this morning. You ready for a good luck kiss? Why don't you tell me, do I look ready? Let's see. Ooh, you look good. Highly employable. Oh, yeah? Absolutely. If I was the president of a big aerospace company, I would definitely hire you-- definitely. All right. Okay. From your lips. Don't be such a fatalist. I'm not a fatalist, I'm a realist. I mean, aside from Aerodytech, aside from the company that fired me, there are only two other firms in Phoenix that do anything even remotely related to the kind of work that I do. And one of them is laying people off. This may literally be the last engineering job in town. That's okay. You only need one. You're a brilliant man, Mr. Dubois. I've been following your career for some time. We'd be lucky to have you. And that would be that, except that, for some reason, at this particular moment in time, there are also two or three other engineers who I expect we'd be lucky to have and I've yet to meet with them. So I'm going to have to ask you to be patient, bear with me. May take me a week or two to identify just who it is I'm going to ask to join us. Of course. I understand completely. It's a big decision. For both of us. Now that we got that out of the way, I have to ask you, um... kind of a peculiar question. Okay. Your wife-- she wouldn't, by any chance, be the Dubois woman who was on the news earlier this year? Why? Is that going to be a problem? Depends what you consider a problem. My wife followed that story very closely. When I told her I was meeting with you this morning she made me promise I'd find out. Well, please tell your wife I am married to Allison Dubois. And she is the woman that they were writing about. Frankly, I take issue with a lot of the things that were said, a lot of the things that were implied. Well, it can't be easy. For you or her. For what it's worth, my wife is a big believer. And her husband? Well, I'm a big believer in my wife. Which brings me to my next peculiar question. What are the two of you doing this evening? JOE: Hey. Hey. How'd it go? Honestly, it's a little hard to say. But I need a favor. So let me get this straight-- they're having a party at their house. It's kind of a charity thing. Tonight. I know, it's a little bit odd. And your new boss? He's not my boss yet. Right, not your boss yet-- wants us to come to this party because his wife thinks I'm interesting. Uh, you make that sound like it's a bad thing. Well, just so you know, it feels like a bad thing. I'm not a freak, I'm not an oddity, I'm not a science experiment. I don't even know what you're talking about now. What is going to be expected of us when we go to this party? What is she expecting me to do? Do? I don't know-- eat, drink, maybe be merry. And you're fairly sure her idea of merriment doesn't include me sitting in the corner reading tea leaves or telling a fortune or two? Allison, this man that I met today, Pet Peter Barrister-- he strikes me as a fairly sophisticated man. I've got to believe that if he's looking for party entertainers he has the means and the wherewithal to find them on his own. I honestly think that his wife is legitimately interested in you. Which is another way of saying that you are someone that she would love to meet, period. Now, if you don't want to go to this party, I guess we won't go to this party. But I got to tell you, finally, you doing what you do and you being who you are, has the potential of giving us-- giving me-- a leg up in a situation where I could use it. Now, he's interviewing two other people. I'm betting neither of them are married to a famous psychic. I'll tell Ariel that she's babysitting. We need a signal. Hmm? What do you mean? Well, what if we do if Mrs. Barrister corners me tries to get me, you know, to guess people's birthdays or the future... I don't know. Hmm, let me see... Why don't you just give me that look you always give me and then I'll, uh, interject myself in the situation. I'll know what to do. What are you talking about? What look? I don't know what look you're talking about. You know, I think you're intentionally being vague because you actually find this situation amusing. Well, it's not amusing. Not to me. Yeah, that's the one. Oh, hi. Hi. Hello. Hi, um... I'm Joe... Joe Dubois. Yeah, I recognize your wife from the newspaper. You must get that all the time. Allison. I'm Bonnie Barrister. I'm so excited that you're here. Come on in. We're thrilled to be here. Oh, please, come in, make yourself at home. JOE: Thank you. There's a bar in the next room, and there's food as well. Peter is around here somewhere. I have to iron out a few wrinkles with the caterer, but after I'm through I plan on finding you. I'll be here. Wonderful. Wonderful. You're not fooling me. That's not the look. I see you've been abandoned. Uh, no, he's just... hunting and gathering. (laughing): Oh, my. Does that make my husband his prey? (laughing) I hope Chardonnay's okay. Thank you. For what it's worth, ow Peter's very taken with your husband. Not just because I'm taken with you. I have to be honest with you, Allison. I don't know how you can live with it. I'm sorry. Live with what? With this city and the people in it. The way they treated you, the way they treated the district attorney. I followed that story like a hawk. You said that that man, Walter Paxton, murdered his wife and he did. You said that the reporter, P.D. McCall, would get killed, and she was. And you found the evidence to put Paxton away, you did. And then it was as if it never happened. The district attorney was gone, and you were treated in the press like some kind of pariah. Or worse-- some kind of nut. But you were right about everything. Thank you. Oh, there's Melissa. Have you met my daughter Melissa? No, I don't believe I have. Oh, I would love for her to meet you. She's listened to me talk about you for quite a while now. And besides, she's getting married next month. Oh, congratulations. She is gonna get such a kick out of this. Just let me know if you have any premonitions. Oh, what do you mean? Oh, wedding-day disasters, um, how many grandkids I can expect, that kind of thing. Bonnie, I need to let you know it doesn't really work that way. I'm joking, Allison. I know she's here somewhere. Oh, here's Melissa, right over there. Don't do this. Oh, my God, how do I not? How do you not? Al, come on! You're talking about something that, if it happens at all, probably won't happen for years. I mean, look at her. She's fine now. JOE: She's happy now. She's not in Paris. She's nowhere near a corkscrew. Hell, she's not even married yet. What's the harm in just letting her enjoy this party? Are we in agreement? Are we in agreement about what? About not saying anything-- not tonight. 'Cause I really don't think that's gonna help my cause. BONNIE: Allison, you took off so suddenly. Are you okay? Yeah. Uh, no. I get headaches sometimes. Well, if you'd like, I'm sure we have some aspirin upstairs. Oh, no, no. I'm fine. Bonnie, who... who's that man with Melissa? Oh, that? That's Steven, Melissa's fiance. That's her fiance? This isn't right, Kent. Okay, wait, wait. Who's Kent? I overheard somebody earlier mention a Kent. Oh, Kent. God, no. Kent was Melissa's first husband. She was married before? Three years. Three horrible years. They didn't happen, by any chance, to have honeymooned in Paris? That's very good. Isn't she something? (chuckles) Come on, admit it. That was the most fun you've had with your clothes on in a very long time. Don't push your luck, buster. You don't fool me, uh-uh. I saw smiles. I saw phone numbers being exchanged and I saw a kiss good-bye. All right. I was just trying to help my deadbeat husband get a job. Yeah? Well, all right. Methinks she doth protest too much. Okay, I admit it. I liked her. She wasn't what I expected. She was smart and she was nice and she liked me. Bingo. Isn't that every one of your minimum requirements for friendship? Yeah, I'm pretty easy, aren't I? I liked the husband, too. In fact, I even like the daughter. I know. She seemed rather pleasant for somebody given to impaling her exes. Whatever she was going through, whatever drove her to do that to her first husband, it seemed like she put it all behind her. It seemed like it was ancient history. Yeah. Thank you. For what? For going. Peter took me aside and he said that he wants to have a second interview with me tomorrow. You're kidding! When were you gonna tell me? I don't know. I think I was afraid to say it out loud. I think I was afraid to jinx it. I think I want this job very badly. I think you're gonna get this job. Do you mean you know that I'm gonna get this job? I don't know anything. I just think that there's nobody who deserves it more than you do. Bingo. You just met every one of my minimum requirements for friendship. Hmm, cool. Hmm. Mm... I didn't want to hurt you, Kent... ...but I'm not gonna pretend anymore. I'm not gonna keep playing this game with you. This whole thing was a mistake. Yeah? I'm starting to sense that. Paris was a bad idea. Maybe I should have gone with the cabin-- our secret hideaway-- but I know how much you love that place. I'm not mad, Melissa, I swear. I just want you to put that down before you hurt yourself, all right? It's okay, honey. It's okay. We made it through so much before. We're gonna make it through this, too. I still love you. Ooh! You okay? Is everything all right? Oh, yeah, yeah... No, no, it's nothing. I'm fine. Just more ancient history. It's... nothing. Hello. Dad, it's for you! Hello. Hi, Peter. We have three kids. There's no such thing as too early. "Family crisis," that's all he said? That's it. That and "Is there any way that you and Allison can come up to the house?" Oh, Allison, Joe, I can't thank you enough for coming. It's been a rough morning. PETER: My daughter and future son-in-law live in Los Angeles. As it happens, Steven had to fly back after the party last night. Some kind of a emergency meeting with one of his clients this morning. Melissa was going to spend a few more nights, finalize all the wedding plans with me, but... PETER: When we went out to the guest house to get Melissa for breakfast, the guest house was empty. Her things were gone, so was she. And I found this message on my phone: "Mom, I hate to do this to you, "but I need some time to think. "I'm just not sure that I can go through with the wedding. "Please, don't try to find me. I'll keep in touch en I can." Does her fiance know? I called him right before I called you. He's a mess. I called the police. Of course, she's an adult. She's allowed to come and go as she pleases. Allison, I... I don't mean to put you on the spot, but... I know from all the articles I've read that you've helped the police find missing people before. You dream about them, right? Yes, but... I thought if you found her, I could talk some sense into her, convince her that she's making a terrible mistake. She's done this before-- run away when there's a lot of pressure. Bonnie, but what I need you to understand is the impressions I get, the things that I see, I can't count on them to point me toward your daughter just because I want them to. Look, uh, true confession time. I'm fundamentally a skeptic about these sorts of things. I've already been on the phone with a number of private investigators. Having said that, we obviouslyant to make sure we've left no stone unturned. Allison, I promise you, if you come up empty, if you come up dry, I'll understand. I mean, you only just met her last night, and briefly at that. I really do understand. I mean, it's not like you've been dreaming about her. (voice breaking): It's not like she's on your wavelength or anything. Well, I guess you're helping the Barristers. I mean, what else could I say? She's desperate, and so nice. I <i>have</i> been dreaming about her daughter. I <i>have.</i> And you're trying to get a job from her husband. And I just... I... I didn't feel like there was anything else I <i>could</i> say. I mean, it's true. All the dreams I've had about her have been about her past. But still, I mean, what else could I say? You said the only thing you could say. Thank you. And, just remember, if we ever hope to send our three girls to college, you damn well better find her. Okay. How about this? Is it possible that you've dreaming about Paris because that's where Melissa's run off to? That makes no sense. Makes sense to me. Oh, come on. What woman in her right mind would go to the place where her first marriage fell apart to figure out whether or not to get married a second time? Moving on. What else do you remember from that first dream? Well, she was upset. She didn't want to be there-- Paris, I mean. That's it? That's it. He poured her a glass of wine, she stabbed him through the hand with a corkscrew. Those are the highlights. What? That's all right. I didn't want to work there, anyway. All right, that's not fair. It's not my fault that the dreams I'm having have nothing to do with where she is now. The second one same as the first? Yes. Second one same as the first. Corkscrew through hand. Smashed bottle against wall. Sounds romantic. She said that Paris had been a mistake. He said they should have gone to the cabin. What? He called it their secret hideaway. The cabin. That's what he called it. Did either of them happen to mention where it was? I'm going to call Peter. He's not going to know where it is. It's a secret hideaway. Yeah, well, maybe he can help us find his ex-son-in-law. He's <i>got</i> to know where it is. It was his secret. I hate these foreground trees. I hated them yesterday, ill hate them today. Mr. Henley? Hi. My name's Allison Dubois. I spoke with your receptionist about an hour ago. Oh, right, uh... yeah. Bonnie and Peter's friend. Have we met before? Maybe one of their parties? You look awfully familiar. Mrs. Dubois? Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Bonnie tried to tell me what exactly it was you did for a living, and I didn't get it. This is it. This and six other buildings like it. We design and create exhibits for museums and exhibitions all over the world. That's very impressive. Thank you. This is one of those days where I feel like an overpaid window dresser. So thank you. Now, what can I do for you? Are you shopping for a life-sized, historical diorama of your very own? Or is there something else I can help you with today? Mr. Henley, actually, I was hoping to talk to you about your ex-wife. She's missing. "Missing" may be overstating it. Uh, she ran away. Her parents are very concerned about her. Sounds like my Melissa. So what scared her off this time? I don't know how much you know. I don't know how much the two of you have kept in contact. She's planning on getting married next month. Mel and I haven't spoken in years. I needed to do some healing after our marriage ended. And for my own peace of mind I just had to cut off contact for a little while. I understand. I'm sorry-- I didn't mean to stir up any painful memories. Just no one else seems to know where she might be. So you thought you'd come to the last guy that Melissa ran out on, and see if he could shed any light. I know the two of you had a cabin. Now I know where I know you from. You were in the papers a while back. You worked with that district attorney, right? The one who messed up the serial killer thing? Well, same old Bonnie. Leave it to her to find someone like you to help her with Melissa. Now what did you say? That we had a cabin? No. We didn't have a cabin. There was a cabin that we rented, that Melissa really liked. It was on Lake Mead. And I think she liked it so much because her parents didn't know about it. It was kind of our secret hideaway. Is that where you think she might be? I'm not sure. I'm just trying to help. We went there maybe three or four times, but Melissa handled all the arrangements, so I don't even remember the address. I'm sorry. The owner's first name was Chuck, I think. Sorry. I know Peter and Bonnie are probably beside themselves. But she'll turn up. She always does. Say hi to them for me, will you? Yeah. Thank you. JOE: Yeah, Lake Mead. Well, we hope it helps. Okay, I'm looking forward to it. Bye. I take it no one has heard from Melissa yet? Not yet. They're going to call the Lake Mead Tourist Board first thing in the morning. See if they know of any locals named Chuck who have cabins for rent. It would be completely wrong during ts periodcrisis to wonder when... and if he's ever going to offer you that job, wouldn't it? Yes. It would be completely wrong. But I can't help but wonder either. Is there some particular reason you don't want to take this to the Barristers? Allison, this is not an easy call to make. "Hey, sorry to wake you up "in the middle of the night, Peter, "but my wife thinks your daughter is in the clutches of some maniac." You don't get to pick and choose Hey... which dreams you want to believe in. Listen, I'm not asking to pick and choose. I'm just saying that if we're going to deliver this horrific news, can we at least serve it up with a side order of hope? Just tell me that you saw the, the make and model of the car or the license plate. That you have some clue as to where all this happened. This was just supposed to be so simple. Dream the dream. Find the girl. Get the job. Do we have to wake them up in the middle of the night? Do you think it'll hold till morning? It's like you said... I don't have any clues, just bad news. Yeah, I think it'll hold till morning. The trunk of someone's car? Allison, um... our daughter left us a message. She needed time to think. She wasn't abducted. She wasn't kidnapped. Yes, we asked you to help us find her but, uh... I don't think what you're saying makes much sense. I know how strange this sounds. The dream was very clear. Your daughter is in danger. I think you need to call the police. I think you need to file a missing persons report. I think you need to launch a search for her. We launch this search on the basis of nothing other than this woman's dreams and it turns out she's fine? Turns out she's doing exactly what she said she was going to do? Thinking? She's going to be furious with us. Peter, this woman is trying to help us. She's trying to warn us. She was right about Lake Mead. I was? Partially. We called there first thing this morning. There is a cabin owner named Chuck. I don't remember his last name. He knew exactly who Melissa was. He rented a place to her several times before. But he hasn't heard from her in years. And she certainly isn't up there now. Fine, Peter. You win. She's only half right. Look, all I'm saying is we have three different private investigators out there looking for her. Why don't we take a step back. You take a step back. Someone I trust is telling me my daughter is being held against her will. I know what I have to do. I'm calling the police. PETER: She's changed a lot since that time but... Peter does not look happy. What other choice do we have, Joe? Well, how seriously are the police going to take all this once they hear that you're involved? No one's going to mention me. Oh, excuse me. Steven, hi. Uh, come in. Come, come in. My plane got in a little early. My favorite son-in-law to be. I'm glad you're here. What... What is all this? Steven... I can't give you specifics just now, but suffice it to say that we have reason to believe that someone may be holding Melissa somewhere against her will. You're kidding me, right? But that's not possible. I don't want to believe it either... No. You don't understand. It's actually not possible. She just left me a message an hour ago. (on voicemail): Hey. It's me. I know I'm being a coward, leaving a message, but... I just didn't think I could handle talking to you. Not yet. I'm not going to tell you where I am, but I wanted you to know that I was safe. That I'm thinking about you. About us. I just need little more time to figure it all out. When I do, I'll be in touch. I promise. BONNIE: Oh... I turned my phone back on when the plane landed, there it was. She knew I was flying back from L.A. today. I figured she did it on purpose. Called my cell when she knew it'd be off, so she could avoid speaking to me. Oh, thank God she's okay. Thank God. I'd, uh... I'd better explain to the detectives why we won't be needing their assistance after all. As for the two of you, I suggest you slip out of here quietly, before I ask these police officers to find something to charge you with. Hey. ??? Kids down? Yep. And out. All except Ariel. What you doing? What you doing? I'm looking for a job. How's it going? Well, that depends. How you feel about Oregon? I'm so sorry. I know how badly you wanted that job. I know how badly we needed that job. I just... (sighs): I don't know. (sighs): Okay. Guess I'll go to bed. Co here. REPORTER: A federal jury in Chicago found reputed Mob boss Joseph Binale Nardiello guilty on all charges today after a five-month trial in federal court. A racketeering conspiracy charge included in the indictment carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. Sentencing will be set on February 28. You ? See? Someone had a day worse than ours. (on TV): And... (remote clicks): Morning paper! Read all about... (remote clicks): Big news out of Chicago today as Joseph Binale Nardiello was found guilty on all charges, after a five-month trial. You okay? Everything all right? Yeah. I think so. You remember when I told you that Melissa would never have gone back to Paris to figure out whether or not she wanted to marry Steven? I think I must have been wrong. Oh, Mr. Henley. Ah, thank goodness. I was afraid I might've missed you. You have so many buildings here, I wasn't sure this was the right one. Mrs. Dubois, did you call? Was somebody in my organization supposed to let me know that you wanted to see me? No, it all happened spontaneously. You said that you had read about me. Yeah. I had a dream last night... a dream about Melissa, about where she may be. I know this sounds crazy, but I think that she may be in Paris. I think she may be in the hotel that the two of you honeymooned in. What?! It doesn't make a lot of sense to me either, but there you go. Anyway, I spent most of my day trying to figure out which hotel in Paris. And it's a long story, but I can't really ask Bonnie and Peter. And then I realized... I could ask you. I know it sounds crazy. Let me get this straight-- you... you saw Melissa... in the same hotel that she and I honeymooned in... in a dream? Okay, um... Residence de Bastille. ??? Yeah. But I'm afraid you're not gonna find her there. Why do you say that? It was torn down in 2003. No, are you sure? Positive. I tried to book a room there last year. Look... I don't mean to tell you your business, but... it sounds to me like... your dream was just a dream. You okay? Yes. I'm fine. I'm sorry I wasted your time. WOMAN: Phoenix Police Department, may I help you? (hushed): What are you doing here? Do you have any idea how much trouble I'll be in if anybody saw you? What if Van Dyke walked in? Wait a second. I'm confused. How could anything you've seen possibly have happened in the present, in Paris, no less, if that hotel room doesn't exist anymore? I think he built it. The hotel room-- I think he built it. He recreated it down to the titiniest detail. I think he even duplicated the view. You're serious? Look, I know how it sounds. I tossed and turned about this all last night. But this is what this guy does. He builds dioramas. He builds environments. So you're saying you think that Melissa Barrister is being held captive in some fake Paris hotel room that this guy built over there at his business? But why? I don't know. She's about to marry again. Maybe the idea of losing her forever... I think he thought he could win her back. All right, look, even if I could wrap my mind around the idea of this lovesick guy building an elaborate stage set to woo his ex-wife... ...there's no way I can get a warrant to search that complex on the basis of a dream. It's not gonna happen. I know that. I'm just worried. He knows who I am. He knows I'm looking. He knows I know about that hotel room. I think I may have rattled his cage. I am concerned about what he may do to her. No, no, no, I hear that. But I still can't legally go in there. I mean, it's not like somebody called in a fire alarm or a chemical spill or a bomb threat. What are you saying? I mean, I'm going to be in that area around 10:30 this morning. About an hour and fifteen from now. And you know, if somebody did call in, like a fire or a bomb threat, something like that, then being in the area, I'd actually be legally obliged to assist the emergency crews-- walk through every building, each and every room in that complex to make sure that everyone was evacuated. But failing that... Oh... In any case, I'm sorry I couldn't have been more help. Somebody please let me out of here! Please let me out! Please! Somebody, please! Somebody... (door opening) NEWSCASTER: Melissa Barrister was released from Casa Valley Memorial Hospital this morning where she was held for 24-hour observation after spending four nights a captive of her ex-husband, Kent Henley. Mr. Henley, who abducted his former wife at gunpoint, went to great lengths to give her family the impression that she had run away, even going so far as to force Ms. Barrister to leave a message on her fiance's cell phone that indicated she was safe and would come home soon. In other news... BRIDGETTE: This is so not fair. They didn't even mention how Mommy helped. Here, hon. Well, it's okay, honey. Mommy's had more than enough attention the last few months. Mr. Barrister knows, though, right? Now he'll give you the job? Uh, well, he would give Daddy the job, except he doesn't own the company anymore. He called us last night to let us know that he was selling it. He wanted to stay home with his daughter, help her get better after everything she'd been through. Okay, but doesn't the new owner still need an engineer? Uh... I'm pretty sure that Aerodytech has all the engineers they can handle. Aerodytech? Your old company is the new owner? Mm-hmm. That's so not fair. What are you doing? Still looking for a job. Any luck? Um, that depends. How do you feel about Oregon? You mean building it or actually living there? Come here. ??? ?? ??? ??
