It's this way. He's in the living room. (sobbing): It's my husband. He just collapsed. And I can't feel him breathing. Ma'am, I need you to step away. Ma'am, I need you to step away. Ma'am, I need you to step away. Please help him. We will do the best we can. Not a sound. Don't move. GLEASON: And the Department of Public Safety wants us to find two days we can set aside so they can send a fellow down here to teach us all this new barcode system they've got for arrest paperwork for cross-jurisdictional and inter-departmental cases. Two days? For barcodes? A most unusual story out of the Southwest today... after making what city dispatchers assumed would be a routine call to a house... Sir, they're waiting for me to call them back ...in the eastern suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona. with those dates. Two Emergency Medical Technicians and their vehicle appear to have vanished. The District Attorney of Phoenix had this to say. I'd like to emphasize that while we are vigorously investigating the disappearance of these men and their vehicle, at the present time there is no definitive proof that they've actually met with foul play. That having been said... Do you remember that lady? Said she dreamt things? From Phoenix. You get me her number. Capture:FRM@ÇòÇò sync:FRM@¹Ûº£ÎÀ</font> You are so mean. Ariel, could you please eat a little faster? What are you talking about? I'm eating as fast as I can. Mom! Bridgette. There's no need to shout, I'm right here. Make Ariel eat faster. Ariel, eat faster. But, Mom, you're the one who told me that eating slow is good for my digestion. This is true. This has nothing to do with 'gestion! This has to do with me wanting to get to school and Ariel trying to make us late! We're not gonna be late. We are gonna leave when we need to leave, whether Ariel is finished or not. Are my ears deceiving me, or is our middle child actually in a hurry to get to school today? We're having a special assembly today. And I don't want to miss it. And you're not gonna miss it. It's "Drug Awareness Day". "Officer Bill" is coming to school to talk to the kids about drugs. Officer Bill, huh? Mm, the "drug assembly". Another rite of passe. DEVALOS: The ambulance answered a dispatch call from 29139 Alma Doarada Court. The call came from a prepaid cell phone. We now know the house they were called to has been on the market unoccupied for five months. So it was a set-up. Certainly appears that way. But why would anyone want to car-jack an ambulance? Drugs, maybe the equipment. Could be it was personal. We have officers interviewing the families of the two EMTs. Reviewing their records. Maybe someone had a beef. Allison Dubois. Well that's pretty damn serendipitous... seeing as how she's exactly who I'm looking for. Is this Captain Kenneth Push of the Texas Rangers? Well, talk about your serendipity working overtime. To what do I owe this pleasure? Well I'm calling kind of unofficially on official business. All right, I'm listening unofficially with both ears wide open. I think I might've come into some information regarding those missing Emergency Medical fellas that have been on the news. I'm holding a man here... and I can't discuss it, and neither can you. He has ties to Arizona. Are you familiar with Desolation Trail, to the junction of Route 65, just east of Phoenix? Yeah. I think you might want to have a look around there. Will do. What do I tell people? How did I hear about this? I don't know. Tell 'em you dreamt it. Okay, it's official. Your sister's asleep. Your mommy's already kissed you good night. It's after 8:30. Now what's this nonsense about "I'm waiting for Daddy"? Mommy told you that I was gonna work late. I know, but I really wanted my kiss, and I have some really important news. Shh, shh, shh, shh. You'll wake your sister. All right. There's your kiss. Now, can this stuff wait 'til tomorrow? 'Cause Daddy's really tired. Okay, what's this stuff? Did you know that there's over 150 street names for heroin? That's what you wanted to tell me? Okay. Great. A hundred and fifty. Got it. Let's get some rest. They call it "H," "big daddy," "reindeer dust" and even "Bart Simpson". Excellent. Now we know. Wanna hear the names for PCP? Uh, no, that's okay. How 'bout marijuana? Hey, Bridge... "Mary Jane"... "Panama Gold" and there's "Spliff." "Spliff", huh? Hmm, yeah, I heard that one. You have? Where'd you hear it? Probably when I was in drug assembly, years ago. You had drug assembly? Oh, yes. So you learned all about drugs. Oh, yes. So... you would never use them. Oh, yes, oh, no. Not ever. Not ever? No. Not ever. Okay. Great. We're both drug free and ready for a good night's sleep. Don't let the bed bugs bite. I won't. (whispering): Wait, wait. The ambulance drivers? They found them? They were there? Oh, yeah, we found 'em. What's left of them anyway. At the bottom of a 300-foot drop. I'll call you when I know more. Thank you. Are you gonna fill me in? Or am I gonna have to read about it in the paper? They found those EMTs. Both dead. Both... murdered. (sighs) That's terrible. It's horrible. But? But... and it's not a big thing. I told them that I knew where they were. That I had a dream. Okay. But I didn't really have a dream. Captain Push called me this morning from Texas. He told me where they were. I guess I just feel kinda funny about lying and getting credit, all of that. Boy, I gotta tell you. On the scale of white lies... that's got to be about the whitest. And who cares where the clue came from? I mean, the important thing is that we now know that these guys were murdered. Which means you and your friends can get on with the business of trying to figure out who did it and why. Who you calling now? Captain Push. I wanna let him know and thank him. Allison, it's almost 10:00. It's almost 11:00 in Texas. Don't you think it'll hold 'til morning? That's an excellent choice. Now just turn off that light and warm up that bed. 'Cause Daddy's tired and he's got some serious sleeping to do. This way. SECURITY GUARD: Don't move. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Push here. Hey, it's Allison. Did I wake you? I, I have some good news. I, I mean, it's horrible news, but I thought you'd want to know. Okay. Well, we found those EMTs. They were right where you said they'd be. They'd been murdered. Ambushed and murdered. Anyway... I wanted to thank you. Don't thank me. I didn't do anything. You okay? Me? Never better. Oops, I've been caught on the phone with a strange man by my husband, so I'll have to take you at your word. Well, tell, uh, your husband the strange man says "hey." Will do. JOE: I need you girls ready in five minutes. Mommy's got a dentist appointment. I got sticky hands. I know. So I'm taking you to school today. Daddy can't be late for work. Has anyone seen Bridgette? Bridge! Bridgette, what are you looking for? Hey, everybody, what's the big occasion? I don't know, it looks-- I think maybe Bridge was just going through my drawers. It looked like maybe she was looking for something. Is that true, honey? Were you looking for something? Do you need something? N-No. I don't know. Well, you know what? Whatever it is is gonna have to wait until tonight, um, 'cause I got work and the kids have school. Bridge, I need you in the car. I swear I have no idea what that was about. Good luck at the dentist. Don't remind me. Whoever you are, I can't do this right now. I'm late. I'm l-late. Ow! Late, late, late. Captain Push. You want to hear a story? You dreamt it? For months now. Little bits at first. The ambulance light, the wood floor of the living room. Then bigger pieces. The ambulance being called to the scene, what happens in the house. It didn't all come together in one event till a couple weeks ago. Didn't know what to make of it till I saw your boss on the TV yesterday afternoon. I thought I was going crazy. Might go yet. That's why I flew all this way. That's why I showed up like I did. That and, uh... ...one more thing. I saw the people who did this. I know what they look like. I cannot walk into a room full of other police professionals and offer my help based on the fact that I've had a dream. But you did have a dream. You were in a coma for months. I have to believe something could happen to your brain if you're gone that long. I'm not an expert, but... It's gotta be you. When we're in that room looking at those pictures,it's gotta be you. You had the dream. You're looking for the faces. Speaking of which, when was the last time you saw your cardiologist? Oh, cardio... Okay, I'm gonna call Phoenix General. I'm sure your old friends will be thrilled to see you again. Everybody who's anybody in Phoenix crime. Black males back to about '97. Also, white women back to the mid '90s. Also got the crime scene photos in this folder in case you need a mory jogger. Can I buy you a cup of coffee, Captain? I promised Ms. Dubois here I'd keep her company. Take a rain check, though. All right. Sorry to have wasted your time, Allison. I saw it so clearly in my mind. No. No need to apologize. I shouldn't have to tell you all this means is that our killers haven't committed any crimes in the Phoenix area. We'll find them. I guess this is the house. Yeah. And who's this? That's one of the EMTs who was murdered. There's something wro... Are you telling me these are the two people you pulled out of that ravine? Yeah. I saw two white men. In my dream, they were both white men. Okay. Sometimes dreams are like that. Sometimes the details are dead-on, and other times... I-I don't know. This... This whole thing doesn't sit right. You know what you need? I was thinking dinner. ALLISON: Ariel, hang up the phone! All right, time for the daily phone intervention. You seem awfully taciturn, young lady. Bridgette. Honey, we have a guest. The polite thing to do when you have a guest is to make conversation. Why don't you tell Captain Push about your day? Yes, indeed. Tell me about your day. Okay. Well... (chuckles) ...doesn't have to be about your day. Tell me about anything. Tell me what's on your mind. I'd love to hear it. I'm a pretty good listener. I don't want to tell you. Well, okay. Just... sometimes it's good to get things off your chest. Especially if something's bothering you. You won't like it. I won't like what's bothering you? It's against the law. Oh, you did something against the law? No. My daddy did. Bridgette, what are you talking about? I saw Daddy smoking drugs. Daddy? I saw Daddy smoking drugs! All right, here we are. One big, happy, fam... ALLISON: Hey, shh... Bridge? Shh! Don't throw my daddy in jail! Jail? Daddy, are you going to jail? What?  What's she talking about? Mom? Ariel, just don't talk right now. Sit down, just eat your dinner. Bridgette, honey, how about you and me go in your room and talk about this, okay? Come on. I'm sorry, Daddy. I'm sorry. Did I miss something? Wh-What's going on? Just entertain our guest. Okay, you're upset. I can see that. But to be honest with you, I'm mystified. You're mystified? Apparently, your daughter looked you straight in the eye and asked you if you ever did drugs, if you would ever do drugs. And you said? "Never." I admit it-- that's what I said, "Never." Which way to the electric chair? You lied! Uh, yeah, you're damn right I lied. And I would do it again. Are you forgetting? She's eight. We can't expect her to understand things either of us might have done years ago. Before we were a family. She's not old enough to understand the social context of college life in the '80s. She's a kid. Yeah, she's a kid who sees things! Things that make her really smart about being able to know who's telling the truth and who's lying. Is that what this is about? She saw me? Smoking something? In her head? Well, I hope you told her it wasn't true. No! What?! Joe, I spent my entire childhood having my mother tell me the things I saw in my head were nonsense. I'm not doing that to my girls. But this isn't about you and your mother. It's about me and my daughter. So what did you tell her? I said, "If Daddy did that, "it was probably a really long, long time ago, and he fibbed about it because he was ashamed." Ashamed. Well, you're not proud of it, are you? It's not... one of the highlights of my life, no. But I don't think I would describe it as a period of enormous shame either. Well, I didn't have a lot of choices. You'd already lied to her. She was already hysterical. So now she thinks I'm a liar, a drug addict and filled with shame. You can't lie to these kids. What would you prefer that I said? Wait, forget that. What if she had asked you, Miss Holier-Than-Thou? Or are you forgetting your own sordid past? I'm not forgetting anything. I'd like to hope that I would find a way to tell my child that people make mistakes. People learn and they change and they grow. And it is every parent's wish that their child avoid making the same bad choices their parents might have made. Ooh, aren't we impressive? In the safety of our bed, in the safety of our room, with no children anywhere in sight, giving you that eight-year-old stare. Oh, well, okay, fine. We'll just see, won't we? 'Cause the next time the word "drugs" or "sex" or "tattoos" or "piercings" comes out of one of our psychic children's mouths, I'm tossing you in front of the bus. And don't think I won't do it. You're so lucky that couch is taken. I'm a lot of things, but lucky ain't one of them. I-I don't understand. Why didn't you tell me about this dream before? PUSH: There was nothing to tell. It was a couple people I wasn't even sure existed doing things in places that had no names, no location. Well, not till tonight, anyway. It was a dream, for crying out loud. Pretty much nailed it. Harrigan Construction and Demolition. Killed the guy in the guardhouse, cut a couple locks with torches, then made off with almost half a dozen bricks of C-4. They... they cut the locks with torches? Well, whatever. The end result's virtually the same. I'd say, uh, you're two for two, lady. Captain. I'd say you're two for two, fella. So, these people, now they have an ambulance and explosives. You didn't happen to have a dream that you didn't share with me that might shed some light on what they're planning on doing with a bunch of explosives, did you? No. But even if I did, and even if there were, I'm not sure I'd be inclined to believe what it was showing me. This place, that building, it's all... it's not right. It's not what I saw. What are you talking about? Harrigan Construction, just like in your dream. Yeah, the name's the same, but everything else is different. The... buildings, the lettering on the sign, there's no guard shack at the main gate, nobody was cutting any locks with torches. This is all... wrong. Didn't you mention to me that the woman's chin was more triangular? Oh, yeah, yeah. I did, yeah. Uh, actually, I think I used that word "triangular." Her chin. Excuse me. It's sad. She has a keen intuition but a feeble memory. Yeah. Of course I can bring him down early this evening. ALLISON: Uh, excuse me. (whispers): Yeah. That was the hospital returning my call. When is the last time you saw your doctor in Texas? There's some issue with your pacemaker. They want to open you up and fix whatever it is. They want me to bring you in there this evening, do the procedure in the morning. It's not supposed to be a big deal. Are you gonna say anything? You and your family ever had real Texas chili? I call the phone! Don't worry, no one's gonna want the dumb old phone. Girls... It's nice of you to offer to make dinner, but... No buts. Chili's a man's job. Besides, if I let you help me, you might find out my secret recipe. Now, just go... take a bath or something. Come back and get me when it's time to drive me to the hospital. You drive a hard bargain. You want to help? What are you making? Finest Texas chili this side of the Colorado River. Wait till you taste it. That's okay. I'm not hungry. It's hard to have an appetite when your daddy's a liar. (whispers): Come here. Whoa, baby. I understand how you feel, by the way. Oh, yeah? Sure. Somebody I trusted told me a lie once. My mama. Your mom? It was a big lie, too. See... my daddy left when I was a baby. Once I got old enough to ask after his whereabouts... my mama told me he was dead. And he wasn't? He was alive and tearing it up. Were you mad at your mom for lying? Oh, heck yeah, I was mad. The next day, I joined the Texas Rangers, learned how to track a man, so I could find my daddy. And did you find him? I found him, all right. Was in a bar outside El Paso. And he wasn't fit to be anybody's daddy. Man was a mean-spirited, card-cheating, lying, angry drunk. Didn't care anything about anybody. Sure wasn't proud to see how I turned out. Wow. Yeah. You know what I did? I went crawling home to my mama and begged her to forgive me for how I treated her. And did she forgive you? Of course. She knew what kind of man my daddy really was. And she knew how upset I'd be if I ever found out the truth. Which is why she told me that lie. I was too bull-headed to understand it, but she lied to me because she loved me. She lied to me to protect me. We understand each other? I think so. Good. So... why don't you put those tomatoes in that pot? I er tell you how much I hate these places? That's peculiar. Most of the people I know love going to the hospital. They can't get enough of it. MAN: Captain Push. I'm sorry to keep you. My 5:00 ran long. I'm Dr. Sanborn, head of Cardiology here at Phoenix General. Welcome back. Be nice. (chuckles) This is my friend, Allison Dubois. Nice to meet you. The physician who actually did your surgery is out of the country. This is a fairly minor procedure. If you're agreeable, I can certainly take care of it for you. Frankly, the sooner you get it done... I mean, there have been a couple of product failures. Well, head of the department. You can't get better than that. So, have, uh, Mike and Janice stopped by to say hello? I'm sorry, Mike and Janice? Apparently, they were your ICU nurses when you were a patient here. It's okay if you don't remember. I'm told you were in a coma for much of your stay. And I'm told I'm absolutely delightful to be with when I'm in a coma. Seriously, you woke up. I know it doesn't sound like much, but given the depth and duration of your coma, it's something of a minor miracle. When you work the ICU, you remember the miracles. Hey! Nice. Yeah, I think it might actually be the same room as I had last time. No, you were in a lot of different rooms last time. When you were here, you were in big rooms with a lot of beds. Private rooms like this. They all kind of look alike, but no. I see you have your sleeping pill and your fashionable sleeping attire. You're just jealous. I did a little checking on your two favorite nurses. It turns out they were both working the night shift all week so there's no way they could have been here and... They've been at the hospital forever. Everyone describes them as "lifers." And everyone just adores them. So they're neither my ambulance-jackers nor my explosives thieves. No, just really great nurses. Uh... Joe's gonna be walking in the door right about now. Hey, I promise you I will be here in the morning before you get out of surgery, okay? What if I have another dream? Seriously, if you need anything, call me. Daddy's home. Hold your applause. Hey. Hey. Mom had to drive Captain Push to the hospital for something. I don't think it was a big deal, though, because he made his chili before she took him. Mm, chili. Excellent. Where are your sisters? Um, Marie fell asleep on my bed. I was reading her a story. That's all right. I'll carry her back to her room. And Bridgette's been getting ready for bed for, like, an hour and a half. Yeah? I think she's waiting for a kiss. From me? The fugitive? The liar? I don't think so. Bridge, it's Daddy. I just want to let you know that I'm here if you want a kiss. If you want to wait for Mommy, that's cool, too. Oh! Hey! Bridge... I'm so glad you're home! Oh, God, I'm glad to be home. It's good to be home with you. It's good to see you, honey. I made you a picture. It's of you and me on the carousel. Yeah? Do you like it? Doesn't it look exactly like you? I like it. Of course, I like it. Look at that. It looks just like me. Oh, Daddy, you're such a liar. MAN'S VOICE: The key to it is getting an ambulance. Ambulances can go anywhere. Nobody questions an ambulance. Okay, but how do we get our hands on one? We take it. We call for one and we take it. Really? Don't they usually show up with people attached? EMT's, doctors, whatever? I don't understand why you're having difficulty with this. You've never disposed of a body before? Aren't you the one who taught me about Desolation Junction? Come on, this is a good idea. I need you to get on board. Fine. Fine, I'm on board. But I still don't get it. How do we get you out of here? I don't know. We're going to need a huge distraction. An explosion, maybe. You know how to get your hands on explosive, don't you? Yeah, of course I do. It's why God invented construction companies. I'm confused. I mean,when is this gonna happen? The court order says they have to schedule a hospital visit for me every year, year and a half to check for polyps. So, ideally, it would be the next time I'm here. What about collateral damage? There's gonna be smoke. We want to knock out the power. What about all your roommates here? These guys? (scoffs) They're halfway gone already. Comas, worse. That guy over there, he's a cop of some kind from Texas. Been unconscious for months. We'd probably be doing him a favor. NURSE: Captain Push? Are you awake? Captain Push? Hi. It's 5:00 a.m. I'm here to take you down to surgery. There we go. Hmm, we have a little extra security in place today. I'll be right back. I'm gonna make a run for it. Yeah, he's in with the doctors right now. Don't worry about where I got it. That's why God invented construction companies. Just wait for my signal. How do I feel? How do you think I feel? I don't know. How'd you like to have three feet of tubing shoved up your ass? All right, Captain Push, I'll take you in now. That man cuffed to the chair with that guard, who was that? Um, I believe his name is Sergei something. Supposedly, he's with the Serbian mob. Or maybe it's Bosnian, I'm not sure. They brought him in from the state penitentiary to have a colonoscopy. I swear, those prisoners have a better medical plan than I do. Has he been in here before, this hospital? Actually, yeah, about a year, maybe a year and a half ago. He had some polyps removed. When they bring a prisoner in, they tighten up security all over the hospital. It's a real pain in the neck. All right. Now, you're gonna feel a little woozy. I've got to get to a phone, make a call. No, now is probably not a good time. There you go. Okay? (slurring): Phone... it's important. Don't you worry, Captain Push, everything's gonna be just fine. Fine... Doctor, please call. Please call. What's he saying, "police" or "please"? Please call.??? Let's give the cowboy a little more fairy dust. Make sure he's completely in dream land. Call... (mumbling) Ah! What the hell? Yeah. (alarms blaring) Let's get him out of here. Come on. Give me a hand. Let's go this way. Go this way. Wait, wait, wait. Over here. Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go! Please help. It's all right, cowboy. Please call... Shine that flashlight! I can't see a damn thing! Let's hurry. Don't worry. The ambulance is waiting. Allison, what are you doing? What's going on? Lay back down. It's 3:00 in the morning. It's 3:00? Are you sure? I don't know. It's dark. Clock says 3:00. I'm pretty sure. They haven't operated yet. Then there's still time. Time for what? NURSE: Captain Push. Hi. It's 5:00 a.m. I'm here to take you down to surgery. I'll be back in a moment, okay? How did you sleep? Did you get any sleep at all? Allison, this is important. We don't have much time. You calm down. There's a plan I heard about when I was in a coma a year and a half ago. Okay, I believe you. They're gonna blow up this hospital today. Minutes from now. It's got nothing to do with seeing the future, nothing to do with dreams. You got to believe me. I know what I'm talking about. I'm a lawman, I'm not psychic. Yeah, but I am. You can stop pacing any time. I can see the ambulance parked out there and your crew hasn't lit the fuse yet. What's the problem? They're paid to be thorough. Let them be thorough. Time to go. It is that, gentlemen. And don't even think ???? PUSH: Oh, that'll be my cab. I'm gonna go see. Me, too. Me three. You know, you should've let us drive you to the airport. Oh, please, it's Sunday. Besides, y'all have already extended me way more hospitality than anyone has a right to expect. Nonsense. True. Let me get that. Thank you. Well, I guess this is it. It? You think so? Something tells me you will be back. What do you mean? You think I might need another tune-up. (chuckles): What do I look like, a fortune teller? I just sense that you'll be back. Till we meet again. Oh, if you see my daddy's ghost, please tell him I'm sorry I had to tell such a tall tale about him. He'll understand.
