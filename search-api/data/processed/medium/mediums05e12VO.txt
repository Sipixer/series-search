When school starts, when school gets out, clubs they go to, friends' houses. I want a detail on that house 24 hours a day until we find this lunatic. This is Allison Dubois. And this is Lucas Harvey. What do you want? God has a plan, and there's no room in it for prophets. For seers. You and the Almighty will be discussing it face to face. It's holy water. To cleanse you with. You okay? You hurt? Look, Joe, I'm contemplating a stock purchase. I... need some advice on which way to jump. Markets and finances-- that's really not something that I know a lot about. From your wife, Joe. This is an article about them. I can't read it because there's a doll-shaped hole cut in it. Yeah. You got to tell your boss to buy that stock. It's gonna go up today, way up. Did you happen to check the market when it closed this evening? I guess they were up... a little bit before lunch. And then they just fell off the face of the earth. I got to start laying people off. You okay? Sir, do you think some water would help? I think this guy's a dentist. The one who keeps gassing these girls. This looks like a picture of the woman that I dreamt about. But she looks dead. That's because she is dead. That's not possible. I saw it. You saw wrong. Hello, Allison. Dreams don't just happen. They have to come from somewhere. And for the last little while, your dreams have been coming from me. Sweet dreams... bitch!  ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾</font> -=ÆÆ ÀÃ ÐÜ ×Ö Ä» ×é=- ·­Òë£º Ð£¶Ô£º Ê±¼äÖá£ºgiaku</font> -=ÆÆ ÀÃ ÐÜ ×Ö Ä» ×é=- Â¼ÖÆ: Î°´óµÄKK´ó´ó</font> -==http://www.ragbear.com==- ÁéÃ½¼©Ð× µÚÎå¼¾µÚ12¼¯</font> Joe? Hey. Whatcha doing? Oh, I don't know. Thinking about taking up smoking again, actually. Well, don't do that. All right, if you say so. I am so, so sorry. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to fire these people. I kept lying in bed, and I just go over and over it in my head, and I just... can't figure out how to do it. I know what happened now. Why I dreamt that dream about the stocks and how it all went so wrong. It was Lucas Harvey. What was Lucas Harvey? He's taken control of my dreams. He's changing them. He's making sure that all of them are untrue. It's his way of making me irrelevant. He thinks that he, uh, is restoring some kind of balance between good and evil in the world. He's on some kind of... mission from God. You're not saying anything. I don't care. He's dead. The people I have to fire tomorrow... they're still alive. You coming in? Maybe in a while. Girls... I asked you not to cut up my paper anymore. It wasn't me. It was Marie. She loves cutting dolls out of the stock market listings. Marie, honey, I told you that you can't cut up Daddy's paper to make your dolls anymore. This is Maye and this is Wilt. Wilt? What kind name is that? That's a girl doll, and you can't call it Wilt. Honey, she can call it whatever she wants. But she just... Hey. You can't cut up Daddy's paper anymore. You know what? Daddy doesn't care anymore. Daddy has to get into work early so he can be the first one there this morning. Why? Is something going on? Daddy's just got to give a lot of people some really bad news. Enjoy your dolls, kiddo. You're only young once. Maye's buying Wilt's house today. What's that? Maye's buying Wilt's house. Yeah, that's great, you know? But if Maye had actually bothered to read the paper that she's made from, she'd know that it's not a very good time to buy a house. Bye, Dad. Bye, Dad. Bye, Dad. you are broken Allison, I'm glad you're here. I just got off the phone with Detective Scanlon. He was wondering if we could meet him in the morgue. Allison, you okay? Hmm? I'm fine. Of course. ispected by #8 They found this deep in the nasal cavity of Trisha Daniels. Clearly,omeone took the time to roll it up, insert it. I'm guessing he used a set of tweezers. Anyway, I had them go back and take another look at the body of the first victim, Carrie Denton. And? Well, same kind of tag-- left nasal cavity. What are you telling me, our killer likes to mark his victims, likes to leave a kind of signature? This guy takes pride in his work. Just to be sure, I called the coroner in Scottsdale. He took another look at the body of Cassidy Pierson. Mom? Same thing, same place. Okay, well, I suppose that's progress. - Mommy? - Well, it gets better. They managed to lift a partial fingerprint off the tag they pulled out of Trisha Daniels. We're running it now. Do you have a sense... Mommy? Please... What's going on? Well, that... well, that depends. What do you see? What do you mean? I mean the body on the slab. Do you... do you recognize it? Um, that's, uh, Trisha Daniels. That's the third victim. Why? Is that what you see? There's nothing else there. Allison, what's going on? Nothing. Ah, it's a joke. A person-- not even a person--is trying to make a hideous joke. Well, I would wish him dead, but... that would be beside the point. Mr. Dubois? Hi, Rachel. I just wanted to give you this. It has mlatest contact info. I just thought... should things change, I would love to come back. Oh, really? Well, I thought you'd all go head out to a bar someplace and burn me in effigy. No. Hey, y were a great boss. And... we read the papers. Actually, a lot of us already have temp work lined up at WILT. WILT? Yeah, Worldwide Integrated Logistics and Technologies. They just set up camp at Plaza Industrial Park. I don't think I'm familiar with them. It's a new start-up. But the good news is in this economy they still need people. Their business is going great. Actually, I heard a rumor that Maye Consolidated might buy them up. No kidding. Maye might buy Wilt's house, huh? I'm sorry? No, no, nothing. It's funny how your throat always gets scratchy just when it's time for gym class. I don't see a thing. You sit tight. I'll be right back. Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord. That's from Proverbs. You ever read Proverbs? You ever heard about hell? 'Cause that's where you're going. Tell your mother Lucas Harvey told you he's going to slit your throat and send your little lying ass straight to hell. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'M GOING TO... No! Bridge, what is it? Can't we just sleep with the lights on tonight? What? Why? I don't like to sleep with the lights on. I like to sleep with the lights off. Hey. Bridge, honey, you haven't been afraid of the dark for a long time. Can't I just sleep with you and Dad? Hey. Lucas Harvey visited Bridgette in school today. What do you mean he visited? He's a ghost. She can see him. She was afraid to tell me. She was afraid she was going to frighten me. Wait a second. Is there anything to be frightened about? I mean, I don't like the idea of this dead nut-job following my kids around. Well, honey, there's nothing you can do to stop him. I mean, I just explained it to her. He's only a ghost. He can't actually touch you. He can't actually do anything to you. Except maybe scare you or bother you. And even that, only if you let him. And that worked? Well, that and allowing her to keep her bathroom light on. He tried the same thing with me today, and afterwards I realized the key to making him leave us alone is to ignore him. Deny him the satisfaction of having any impact on us. That's the theory anyway. Let's see if it works. Hey,hat are you doing out here 11:00 at night on the computer? Well, it's the darnedest thing. I came out here to see if any of the engineering blogs have gotten wind of the layoffs that I made today, and I came across this headline. "Maye Consolidated Makes Formal Offer for WILT." Maye bought WILT's house. Remember, Marie this morning, with her paper dolls? I think I've been listing to the wrong psychic. I don't think it's just a coincidence that Marie always cuts those dolls out of the stock market listings. I think that the names that she gives those dolls have meaning as well. I mean, "Maye" and "WILT"-- those are four-letter symbols for companies on the Exchange. Why are you looking at me like that? I'm just dying to see where you're going with this. Where I'm going with this is simple. This morning, Marie looked at the two of us, and she said "Maye is going to buy Wilt's house today." And Allison, that is exactly what happened. Sometime after the stock market closed tonight, Maye Consolidated bought WILT. - They did. Maye bought WILT's house. - And your point is? My point is I think maybe our little girl is able to pick winning stocks. You're joking, right? No, I'm not joking. Joe, she's five years old. She doesn't even know what a stock is. Be that as it may: Maye bought WILT's house. May is a month, okay? Wilt is... a basketball player. I'm just saying, look, is if our little girl happens to disobey me tomorrow and just happens to cut a couple of dolls out of the paper, let's not be so quick to throw them away. That is an insane amount of pressure to put on a five-year-old. I'm not going to put any pressure on her. She's not going to feel any pressure. That is an insane amount of pressure to put on anyone. Oh, is that what you think? You think this is about the stock tip that you gave me? Yeah, I do. And you know what? I think what's happening to you is horrible. I feel terrible about it. I really wouldn't want that for Marie. Well, it's not going to happen. Yeah, well, I hope not. Well, don't lose any sleep over it. Okay, if you say so. I say so. Good night. Good night. I don't know what kind of cable box I have. Black. It's black with a silver plate thing on the front. Look, can I just give yo my account number? Sure, I'll hold. Hello. Yes, I have been on hold. Oh, I would love it if you sent someone. Thursday would be fine between 10:00 and 2:00. Yes, it's 3431 Maple Ridge Drive. 3431 Maple Ridge Drive. Oh, no. Thank you. 3431 Maple Ridge Drive. This is Scanlon. Hold on a second. Sorry. I just didn't want to wake Lynn up. at's up? I think I saw him. Saw who? You know who I'm talking about. I got a good look at his face. He's got that gas that he uses to knock the girls out in his refrigerator. - Allison... - I even got an address. Do you want it? I don't know. I mean, no offense, Allison, but after what happened the other day... Look, no, I know, I get it. I  DO. I-I almost didn't even call you. And I don't know if this address is any good. But we have nothing. We have no leads. We have no clues. How do I not call you? When you put it like that, how do I not look? What's his address? ?.? MAIL Allison Dubois. Well, whatever problems you're having with you dreams, it looks like it's worked itself out. What are you talking about? I'm at 3431 Maple Ridge. The house belongs to a Kevin Flynn. Fridge is full of isoflurane valve inhalers. Bureau drawer is full of pictures of dead women whose faces are beaten to a pulp. Oh, my goodness. Is he there? Was he there when you showed up? Oh, yeah, he's here. In fact, his brains are splattered all over the living room wall. LOOKS LIKE HE KILLED HIMSELF EARLY THIS MORNING. MAYE SNAPS UP WILT Getting into the market? My husband, Joe-- he keeps wanting to invest. It frightens me. Care to see the fruits of your dreams? Turns out the guy was a pharmaceutical sales rep, which is how I'm assuming he got his hands on these. We pulled about a dozen of them out of his refrigerator. He used these to incapacitate his victims. Then he pummeled them to death wearing those gloves. There's steel in the knuckles. Then he posed them, and then he took their photographs. He lived in Phoenix, but he traveled to Scottsdale on business, which helps explain why there were victims in both cities. And, you know, just in case there was any doubt, Flynn had a Ziploc full of these. "Inspected by #8." I guess he thought that was funny. You'll recall we found a partial fingerprint on one of those tags. Forensics just matched it to Kevin Flynn's right index finger. It's a shame I'm not going to get to prosecute him. This would have been an open-and-shut case. You know what I can't figure out is why he killed himself. He had no way of knowing I was going to dream about him, no way of knowing that I would be able to tell you exactly where he lived. I don't really care why this pervert killed himself. I'm just glad he did. Can you keep an eye on all this for a minute till I can send an officer in to gather all this up? Sure. Hey, you're back, Allison Dubois. Nice work. I second that. Thank you. But I didn't do anything. I just went sleep, and it just... came to me. Well, nonetheless. You're still broken. "I didn't do anything. I went to sleep, and it just came to me." What came to you is what I chose to bring to you. You're broken, Allison Dubois. And soon everyone will know it. And no one will listen. And all will be as it's meant to be. Okay. Whatever you say. We found him and he's dead. I had a dream. I saw his address, and now it's over. Maybe. Mind if I just grab this stuff and bring it down to the evidence locker? Ma'am? Sure. It's like a death. For you. What's this? That's a stock. It's a company. They manufacture containers. Huge ones-- the kind you find in ports all over the world. Except that these containers have special sensors inside them that monitor their own contents. And they let you know immediately from the outside whether or not ty contain any nuclear material, like the kind you find in a suitcase bomb or a small terrorist weapon. Why are you showing me this? Well, I want you to buy it. Buy the stock, buy the company, whatever you can. It's going to make you a fortune. Or at least it's going to put you back where you were, which means, hopefully, you'll put me back where I was and let me hire back my people and finish my work. Where'd you get this? Did you get this from your wife? No. Then where'd you get it? Does that matter? Does it matter? I bet damn near everything I own on a stock your wife guaranteed. No, no, no. You pickedhat stock. You asked for her opinion. She did the best she could. I'm picking this one. Pretty cocky for a guy who's done nothing but cost me money. You're pretty arrogant for a person who's done nothing but spend money foolishly. I still own you, Joe. Okay, well, let me put you out of your misery. I want to buy back my company and my idea from you. I beg your pardon? You heard me. If you don't want to buy this stock, I will, and I'll use the money that I make to buy you out. Are you insane? You're not a corporate raider. Even if that stock does go through the roof, where are you going to get the money to buy it? You'd have to invest every penny you own. If that's what it takes, that's what it takes. I'm going to do you a huge favor, son. Save your money. The business is not for sale. Your idea is not for sale. You are not for sale. I mean it, Terry. I want to buy the business back. Just give me a couple days. You'll make money off this. Not for sale. You weren't serious, were you? I couldn't be more serious. Wait. I-I'm confused. Even if Terry was willing to sell you the business, what money is it you were planning on pooling together? Money. Our money. Our savings. Our retirement account. You know, I'd take out a second mortgage again on the house, if I had to. Money. Are you listening to yourself? You're talking about everything we have, and what we have is not much. I'm talking about information that's being supplied by our own daughter. She's five Yeah, and she has yet to be wrong about anything, Allison. I've done my research, you know? I checked with her. I've checked out every single stock, every single doll that she cut out of the paper, and theye all been huge winners. No! No! I am not having this conversation with a man who's maybe a year away from having a PhD, who's trying to convince me to listen to a girl's paper dolls. Oh, so now it's up to me to convince you that our youngest daughter might be sensitive to things that defy, uh, rational explanation? You don't have to convince me of anything. He's not going to let you buy that business, right? Right. Oh, my God. What are you doing here? Come on, get inside. Hurry up. Someone is going to see you. Come on. You're not supposed to be here. That's not part of the arrangement. We're only supposed to talk online. You know that. You want to explain this? THE ARIZONA OBSERVER KILLER LEAVES FINGERPRINT Okay. I made a mistake. But actually, it's no big deal. My fingerprints aren't traceable. I'm not in any system. They can't track me to this. You think. Now we're going to have to be even more careful. I'm thinking we're going to have to slow down. No, no, no. That's crazy. Nothing has to change. Here, look. I was just about toend you these. They're brand-new. Don't you want to see them? Pretty nice, huh? I thought about you when I saw her. I mean, she looks like your type, don't you think? I mean, I know we're not supposed to have a type. We're supposed to be the same guy and all, but, um... I don't know. I saw her and I thought of you. Well, you're upset. There's no reason to be upset. We got the perfect setup here. I get to enjoy your work. You get to enjoy my work. The police still have no idea that there's two of us. Honestly, we don't have to stop. We don't even have to slow down. Not because of that. So, um, you didn't happen to bring anything for me, did you? Oh, nice. Nice. You've got some really... really nice ones here. Oh, my God, there's two of them. Hey, Allison. It's barely 7:00. What are you doing here? He had a partner. Kevin Flynn was working with a partner. What are you saying? It was a two-man operation? One-one would use the gas, and the other... No, no. It wasn't that kind of a partnership. It was more like a killers franchise. Flynn worked here in Phoenix. The other guy worked in Scottsdale. And they made sure to do everything exactly the same so that the police will think that there was only one killer. Why? I don't know. I... To throw us off the scent? I know they enjoyed looking at pictures of each other's work. The girls. I suppose that was part of it. Okay, what does this other guy look like? Well, actually, I'm not sure. Well, I don't understand. How did this come to you? You had a dream? Yes. And was he in it? Well, I wasn't allowed to see him, but that doesn't change the fact that he exists. All right. Since we c't prove that there really is a partner, or a collaborator, a fellow franchisee, and we're not sure what he looks like, if you don't mind, I'm just going to go on about my day as if he doesn't exist. Obviously, if you can come up with a description of this man, or some physical evidence that ties him in to at least one of the murders, all that changes. But I just... I can't do much with what you've given me. I'm sorry. I understand. Well, that's got to be discouraging. I mean, you had the dream, but you couldn't see the killer's face. What happens now? You can't solve the crime. Can't get anyone to listen to you. Well, you're not depressed, are you? Not suicidal? Maybe just a little bit? Are you enjoying this? Well, I take satisfaction in knowing that I'm enabling God's will. Yes. "For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them." Ecclesiasticus. All you're doing is seeing to it that innocent people get killed. How can that be God's will? No, no, no. We're simply allowing people to perish who were meant to perish. "We"? The Lord and I. Yes. You know... you can put an end to all this, Allison. Right. I heard you. Yes. Kill myself. Well, no. That's not going to happen. Well, failing that, you could stop dreaming. Or, at the very least, stop paying so much attention to what you dream. That's what the others have done. "Others"? Well, it's not just you whose dreams I'm editing. Oh, there are many others, all over the world. Dreamers, meddlers, interlopers. People like you too ignorant to understand that their interference is unnatural, an abomination to the truth. But slowly, I'm teaching all of them to ignore their dreams, and teaching those around them to ignore the dreamers. Allison? You okay? Yeah. No. I'm fine. Hello, this is Allison Dubois. I can't get to the phone, but please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Hey. It's me. Um, I justhought you might want to know that, uh, that stock that Marie found... The container company? It took off this morning. You know, if we'd invested even one tenth of our savings, we would have had enough money to put all three girls through whatever college they wanted. Twice. Is that petty of me to point that out? Sorry. I guess I'm feeling a little... petty. Call me back. That didn't take long. Excuse me? Terry? Joe! I just wanted to offer my congratulations. Maybe now you'd be willing to tell me who tipped you to that stock. That's all right. I deserve that. I was arrogant. Must feel good to be on the winning side of an equation. Yeah. Terry, um... Joe, let's be frank. It's still at least a couple of years before your division even has the possibility of turning a profit. It's the most speculative venture I am currently funding. Now, I don't believe for a minute that you could have possibly earned enough off that stock to buy me out, but it's also clear that you're a clever guy, not just as an engineer, but you seem to know your way around the markets as well. So, I'll tell you what. If you're still interested, I'll sell you back your company. I'm not going to let you completely off the hook. You're going to end up paying me a royalty, but if you can get together a couple million dollars, we can figure out how you can pay me the balance over time. That should work for you, and it'll give me the chance to get all that red ink your enterprise generates off my balance sheets. So, what do you say? A couple million dollars? No, no, no, no. I'm not going to negotiate over the phone. I'm just saying, if you still have a desire to do this thing, then, um, I have half a mind to help you. Joe? You still there? Yeah. That's-that's very generous of you, sir. You know, it may take me a little while to put together a couple million dollars. Don't do the modesty thing. I've already seen you in action. Come on! Trade me the Barbershop Bonnie for the Beach Bunny Bonnie! Please? No! You girls ready for bed? No... No. What you doing, hmm? Playing with dolls? Yeah, but Marie isn't playing nice. I wanted to trade, but she won't do it! What's this doll's name? Beach Bunny Bonnie. Beach Bunny Bonnie? What kind of a name is that? I like those names that you gave the dolls the other day. Uh, "Maye and Wilt" and... Those aren't doll names, Daddy. Not really. Well, I know, but I liked them. Hey, you know what I noticed? You didn't cut out any dolls out of the paper today. You told me not to, Daddy! Yeah, you told her not to, Daddy. Yes, I know, but I changed my mind. I'll tell you what, you know. If you want to cut a couple dolls out of the paper tonight before you went to bed and name them, you know, that would be okay with me. If you wanted to. What do you think? Do you want to do it? Uh-uh. Paper dolls are for babies! Wait a second. It'll be fun. Come on. Cut a couple out. You can name them anything you want. Don't you want to make a little, I don't know, Pfizer doll? How about GE? Haven't you always wanted a doll named "GE"? I'm tired, Daddy. "Apple"? It worked for Gwyneth Paltrow. ANSWEAR THE PHONE ALLISION Devalos. Hello... sir? I just got off the phone with the Scottsdale Police. You may have been right. Either Kevin Flynn had a partner or Scottsdals got itself a copycat who wasted no time in picking up where Flynn left off. Oh, no... Yeah, they found the body of a young girl in a Dumpster about an hour ago pummeled to death just the way Flynn used to do it. She was wearing a necklace with her name on it, wasn't she? "Tara." Tara. It was still on her when they found the body. Did you see anything else? His face? An address? A license plate? Yeah. Uh, no. I'M SO SORRY. I'm still not sure I understand why we're driving all the way to Scottsdale. Any forensic information we want, they'd be happy to send us. No, no, I don't think so. Not what I'm after. Sir, I know this is a little unusual, but do you think I could be alone with her for a minute? I don't know if you're still here. I don't know if you can hear me... but I could really use your help. Did you find what you were looking for? No. Honey, just give me... Yeah, Terry? No, it's Allison. Go back to sleep. Go back to sleep, honey. It's 3:00 in theorning. Did I just call you Terry? Yeah, you did. I-I hope you meant Terry your boss, not Terry, some young, fetching figment of your imagination. Young? Fetching? Why didn't I think about that? No, I was actually dreaming about my, my employer. My future former employer. Come on. You don't know that. Yes, I do. He thinks I'm gonna buthe company. He thinks I've been making a killing in the stock market. I suppose that... if you found a way to do it without Marie ever knowing, I mean... You have nothing to fear. I think that we may have already missed the boat on that one. Somebody's knocked the Warren Buffet right out of her. So, any luck in Scottsdale? No. I think he's done it. He's right. I'm broken. what's going on in your head? I've finally been thinking about all the ugly things that he's been saying to me. I guess I can't help but wonder... where is God in all this? I mean, I really do believe that I see these things for a reason. And the reason is to help people to-to make things right. But if that's the case, then how could he be allowed to do this? Maybe it just... It makes me question everything. My God! And I do mean "my God." You sound incredibly bleak. Almost suicidal. Leave my home! Leave this life. It's honestly the only way you'll ever rid yourself of m Allison. I'm staying in your home, in your head, in your dreams. I'm cancer. I live in you. So what shall it be? There's knives in the kitchen. Perhaps one through the heart? We could sit in the closed garage with the car running. I'd let you pick the radio station we listen to as the carbon monoxide suffocates you to death. Forget that. How about some lye? Why don't you drink a cup or so, then stumble into your little girls' room so they can watch you writhe to death as it eats through your organs? Come on, Allison. It's time for you to move on. Actually... we think 's time for you to move on. Remember me? I'm the most recent girl that Donald Crommler gassed, bound, and beat the holy hell out of. "Donald Crommler." That's his name. He lives in Scottsdale on Desert Oasis Road. That's what you came to the morgue to find out this evening, right? She could have stopped it from happening. You should have let her stop it from happening. It was supposed to happen. It was meant to be. No. The only thing that is meant to be is for you to burn in hell. And that's where we mean to take you. "We"? Who's "we"? It's your fault we're dead. You interfered with the dreams of the people who could have saved us. All because you thought they were evil. But those people, the dreamers-- they're not evil. You are. What are you doing? It's time to meet your maker. It's good you're dressed for the heat. Donald Crommler. Desert Oasis Road. Donald Crommler. Desert Oasis Road. Donald Crommler. Desert Oasis Road. What are you doing? What's going on? Is everything all right? Yeah. No. I'm good. I think I'm great. I just gotta make a phone call. Everything is great. ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é -==http://www.ragbear.com==-
