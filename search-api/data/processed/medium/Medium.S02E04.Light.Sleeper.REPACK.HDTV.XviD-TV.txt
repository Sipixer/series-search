I need money and I'm running out of time! Hey! Hey, this is important! Can you help me? I need money! You, you! I'm talking to you! I need money! Allison! Hey, hey, hey! Help me! I need money! Give me money! Give me money! Hey! Hey! - Allison! - This is important! I need help! Can you help me? I need money! I'm running out of time! This is important! - Hey, hey, hey! - I can't talk now! I need money! I need money! How would you normally describe your quality of sleep? I mean, would you say your sleep is normally uneventful? Do you sleep through the night, wake up rested, that sort of thing? Or are you one of those people who wake up several times a night, tired, moody? Pretty normal. I suppose, yeah. Pretty normal... kinda. And you don't remember how you got to the highway, why you were on the highway, anything about the highway? All I remember is my husband slapping me awake. I'll be right back. Look at it from my side... - Your side?! You keep acting as if... - ...spoken to in three years - ...I've done something to you. - is calling me to tell me... This has been done to me! ...standing in the middle of a highway, half-naked! ...no control over what happened tonight. I roll over, you're not there. ...last thing I remember, we were getting to bed. ...wake up our 12-year-old daughter, tell her, don't be scared, but for the next three hours, you're going to be the oldest person in the house. Stop punishing me as if I've done something wrong! You scared the piss out of me, Allison! Okay... I'm pretty sure this will do the trick. Let's take these for the next week or two, just before bed. What are these? It's an anti-anxiety medication. It's okay; all your neighbors are taking it. That's what I thought this was. Look, we don't really understand what causes sleepwalking in adults, but there are usually two contributing factors: One, the victim is usually... Uh... the victim? And that would be me?! Yes, ma'am. The victim is usually wrestling with some kind of unresolved anxiety. Additionally, most sleepwalkers are people whose sleep is being disturbed on a fairly regular basis. I know you said otherwise, but it's entirely possible that it's happening and you're not even aware of it. Anyway, these pills should knock you out enough that you should sleep soundly and return to a normal sleep cycle. Forgive me, Doc, but that's it? A handful of Valium and "call me in the morning"? She didn't just sneak out in the backyard to look for the cat. She stood in the middle of a highway and tried to strike up a conversation with oncoming traffic. What about my anxiety? Do you have any suggestions? I suggest you lock all the doors and windows at night. Here; feel free to call me if you need anything else. "Nan has a new hat. "Nan's hat is made of wool. - "Nan's wool hat is red." - Perfect! Yay! Bravo! Great. Can I talk now? Want to hear me spell Nan? - I think Ariel is trying to... - N-A-N. Nan. Mom... Hey, Bridgette... Yes, you can talk. Anyone can talk whenever they want to. It just... it isn't polite to talk when someone is reading. Ooh-yah. I want to walk home from school. Well, why would you want to do that? Why wouldn't I? We live seven blocks from school. Besides, Hannah walks home from school every day, and I could walk with her. Wow, I don't know. Walk home from school? People still do that? You can't do that! I need you in the car with me. I'm in the sixth grade. I'm not a baby. I'm old enough to stay home at 2:00 in the morning, while you guys had your emergency. What emergency? I want to walk home from school. I do. She wants to walk home from school with her friend. Do you know what I do all day? Do you know what goes through my mind all day? What comes across my desk all day? Of course I do, but she's 12. This is non-negotiable. No! All right, you think so? Let me tell you how this goes: You say it's non-negotiable, and then, one day, you're going to drive to school to pick her up and she's not going to be there. Because that's the way kids negotiate when they're told something is non-negotiable. What is the big deal? Why does she have to walk home? What is she going to do walking home from school with her friend, that she can't do in the car with me? Use bad language, talk about boys, complain about her teachers, complain about us... Allison, look, she's a good girl. All right? We live in a nice part of town. I don't think we have a choice. Bye, Mommy! Bye, lamb chop. Whoa... One more time. Do you ever walk home alone? I never walk home alone. And what if Hannah's staying late? I come out here and I ride home with you. Okay, and if Hannah's sick? I come out here and I ride home with you. And if you and Hannah have a fight? I come out here and I ride home with you. What's the number of the police? 911. What's our phone number? Mom, I'm 12! Okay, fine. - Do you have your key? - I have my key. Now give me a hug. Mom? People can see. Okay. Okay, 4:00! Or earlier, if you want. I want to know where my little boy is. I assure you, Mrs. Church, Ms. Ballou, we're doing all we can to get to the bottom of this. Have you interviewed my ex-husband? Not personally, no, but I believe you know Mr. Calley. He's head of security operations. Security operations?! I always thought that he was in charge of making sure the women arriving didn't run into the women leaving. Ms. Ballou... Do you even know where he is? Of course not. He's gone. They're both gone. He took Justin to some safe haven island that he owns in the Caribbean, and I'm never going to see him again. Ms. Ballou... your ex-husband, Greydon Church, is one of the four or five richest men in the country. I, for one, find it hard to believe he's going to turn his back on that. Oh, he's not turning his back on anything. He's just simply moving it offshore. I don't think that you understand the depth of his hatred for me. When you can have anything that you want, when you can buy anything that you want, and one thing slips away, refuses to be bought? Well, what's the point of having all the money in the world, if you can't use it to exact revenge? I'm sorry there's acrimony between you and your ex, but his extraordinary wealth does not make him immune with regards to the custody laws of this state. If he's kept your son beyond his allowed visitation, or transported him out of state, he will be found, he will be caught, and he will be punished. Really. And his good friends, the mayor and the governor, will allow that to happen? The mayor values his friends, but not above the law. Ms. Ballou, let's be frank: Your divorce from Mr. Church hardly left you a pauper. And, clearly, you have your own friends in high places, otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting here. Technically, your son's gone missing for barely 12 hours and it's entirely possible there's a plausible explanation for where he is. Let us do our work: Begin our investigation and get back to you. Did I mention that one of my good friends from college is a producer for one of the network newsmagazines? You have 48 hours, Mr. District Attorney, or she is prepared to run with a story about how the State of Arizona and the City of Phoenix are providing cover for a billionaire who has kidnapped his own son. Mr. Calley... I need some answers and I need them quickly. Do you know where little Justin Church is? Well, can you at least tell me where Greydon Church is? Well, first and foremost, let me assure you that everything and everyone are fine. Oh, you know that? Yes, I do know that, Mr. District Attorney. Prior to working for Mr. Church, I served Her Majesty for 11 years with MI-6. I know a good many things. You work for the police department, and you are with the Mayor's Office. And you are... Allison Dubois, with the District Attorney's Office. It's 7:00 p.m. and the Big Dog is not here. Big Do g is not anywhere,and the Range Rover is missing. Mr. District Attorney, we know that the child spent the weekend with his father. We know that, at approximately 1900 hours yesterday, they left the premises. Do we know where they are? No. Do we know what time they'll be returning...? Am I worried? No. The fact is, Mr. Church often slips away unaccompanied to do things that men of great wealth like to do anonymously, and without an entourage. He's with a four-year-old boy. Well, perhaps he took him camping or fishing. Do you have a way of getting in touch with him? Does he phone in? Oh, I'm sure I'll be hearing from him soon enough. Well, just so we're clear, if I don't have answers by 3:00 p.m., I'm putting out a warrant. Then answers you shall have. Fat cat politicalcontributors and their domestic disputes... 10:30, we've accomplished nothing. Mark my words: By 1:00, Junior will be home, Mommy will be drunk, and Daddy will have made another million. I'm not so sure. What do you mean? I just... When I shook his hand just now, I saw the moment that he realized that Church was missing. He seemed... I don't know, concerned. He didn't seem casual or nonchalant the way he was a moment ago. He seemed... I don't know... he was anxious. And that proves...? Nothing. I don't know. I just thought it was curious, that's all. Sorry. I didn't mean to snap. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like hell. Oh, no, I'm fine. I just... I didn't get any sleep last night. Okay, well, go on, get out of here. I'll give you a call. Trust me, what you just witnessed: a non-event. Hi, Mommy. Hi, lambchop. Buckle up. That's everybody, I guess. So, how was your day, pumpkin? It was pretty good. We played a lot. Uh-huh. So how was your day, Mommy? It was pretty good... I guess. - Root beer? - Yeah. Thanks. I think he's a high school boy. Am I cutting in line? Can I get two instant picks? Four dollars. 11, 16... 23, 87... He's so cute. Eleven. Nothing. Okay, let's try again. 44... 15... 22, 23... 19. Sorry. 77. Nothing. Should've went with 19. - You spoke to him. - I know! After this, you want to read Nan? Maybe. Okay, where are you? I'm in my office. Is that okay? Sorry, sir, I thought you were someone else. So I'm not in trouble? No, of course not. Well, I just wanted to let you know that I've yet to hear anything more from Mr. Calley or Mr. Church, and I'm starting to grow genuinely concerned about the welfare of this little boy. I don't think I have a choice but to issue a warrant and put out an Amber alert. Anything I can do? Not right now. Just... get some rest and check in with me in the morning. Okay. Huh, look at that. Pizza. - Hi. - Hey. - What's the damage? - $22.11. Hey, Al, do you have any change?! Look in my purse! Hey, I'll be right in. Everything okay? Didn't I have change? Yeah, you had change. What's going on? Oh, my God! Where'd all this money come from? According to this, you went to our bank today at 1:57, you closed down two CDs, our IRA and part of our Christmas club, and in return, they gave you $15,000 in cash. That's crazy! Isn't that your signature? I swear, I haven't been to the bank in two weeks. Well, you were there today, and you obviously authorized this withdrawal. No! I dropped the girls off at school, I went to work, I went to pick up Marie and Bridgette. No. Where did you go for lunch? I didn't go to lunch. Devalos sent me home early. He said I looked tired. He said I looked like hell. When was that? 10:30 or... Wait, wait, wait. I don't get it. What did you do between 10:30 in the morning and picking up the girls from school? I don't know. I-I think maybe I was asleep. I think we need to talk about the driving now. Excuse me? Driving. Apparently you drove all over town today while you were fast asleep. I think that merits some discussion. Well, what would you like me to say? How about, "Holy crap, Joe. I could have died." Our children could have died. You could have killed a lot of other innocent people. We could start there, you could work your way up to "I'm sorry." I'm sorry, I'm confused. I thought I was supposed to play the role of victim in this evening's performance. I'm glad you find this amusing. Did you take one of those pills? Not yet. What are you doing? I don't know, making sure this thing is locked. Trying to figure out a way to keep you and us safe tonight. You know, I'm pretty sure if I can figure out how to drive a car while I'm asleep, I'm sure I can figure out how to unlock a door or open a window. Okay, fine. What do you suggest? Should I tie you to the bed? That sounds like fun. Well, it's not! None of this is fun! Now take your pill! Fine. I'll take my pill. Thank you. Wait a second. Where...? What happened to the money? I have it. It's somewhere safe. I have it. I'll take it to the bank in the morning. I don't understand. Why would you do that? What is it that you're worried that I would do with it? I don't know. I've never been here before. Have you? You took... you took my keys, didn't you? You took my house keys and my car keys? Come on. Let's get ready for bed. Al? Did you hear that? Al? Daddy? It's okay. Go back to bed. Where's the money?! Where's the money?! I need the money! I need the money! We got money. - I need that money! - Of course you do. I'll take you to it. Come on. Come on. Go to bed. Bed! It's right in here. Where? Where's the money? It's right in there. Where's the money? Where's the money?! Morning. Where is she now? In bed, awake, thank God. Well, that won't last. She's going to fall back asleep eventually, and when she does, we want to make sure she's really out. You know where those pills are that I gave her? Yeah, she took one before she went to bed. Well, see if you can get her to take three. Excuse me? You need some sleep. Give her three. That'll put her out for about 18 hours. Is that safe? It's absolutely safe, and trust me, she won't be going anywhere on that dosage. It'll give you and your family some time to recover. Okay. Thank you. But what about afterwards? I can't just keep drugging her. I'm not suggesting that. What you need to do is observe her, listen to her, figure out what the unresolved anxiety is that's causing her to sleepwalk. If you can address the root of the anxiety, you can very likely end the disruptive behavior. Is Mommy picking us up today? Uh, I don't think so, honey. Um, everyone look for my car when they come out of school, all right? Not me, Daddy. I'm walking home from school with Hannah, remember? Right, Hannah. Got it. All right, kisses. Kisses. I'm sorry to bother you. Um, my name is Joe Dubois. My wife came in here yesterday and mistakenly withdrew $15,000. Thank you. I know this sounds kind of crazy, but I was wondering if there was any way I could just, uh... give it back. Uh, it's been barely 18 hours. Well, I don't know what to tell you, Mr. Dubois. Uh, we're a bank, not a department store. We really don't have a return policy. I know, but... No, no, no. We can, we can work with you, but those CDs were cashed in early, and there are penalties for that. So, the balances won't be the same. You know, when she came in here, I sensed there was something strange about it all. The teller brought over her withdrawal slip, and until we convinced her to move the decimal points, she had it made out for $15 million. You know, I read somewhere that the governor calls this his idiot tax. Shut up. 43... 76... nine, 22... Try 16. What? I'm lucky. I have just always been lucky. Try 16. 29. Guess we know why they call it the idiot tax. Try again? 53... 99... 61, six... Five. Hell, five. Got one right. In fifth position, number five. You just won five dollars. Excellent. Excellent, excellent, excellent. See you tomorrow. You are... You are the luckiest person I have ever met. What time is it? Don't you mean what day is it? Oh, my God. How long have I been asleep? About 16 hours. It's night. Oh, my God. What about the kids? Where are the kids? Are the kids in bed? I'm hoping so. Ariel's at Hannah's, Bridgette and Marie are at Alan and Kamala's. What? Why? It's a, it's a weeknight. The girls have school in the morning. All the more reason *** someplace where they can get a good night's sleep. Oh, Joe. It's okay. What about work? Did anyone call from work? This is terrible. Devalos, a few hours ago. He wanted me to tell you that Calley called. Apparently Greydon Church ran off with $15 million in cash and bearer bonds the day he and his son disappeared. Does that number hold any special significance for you? $15 million? Mm-hmm. No. Why? Should it? Apparently you tried to withdraw that same amount from our bank account yesterday. I don't remember. I had a hunch you wouldn't. I am so sorry about all of this. You look exhausted. You need some sleep. Maybe you should get me another one of those pills. No, no more pills. Actually, I thought tonight we'd try something different. Hey, Al. Al, you awake? Shh! Not now! I gotta get to Route 96. Route 96? What's on Route 96? My car keys! I can't find my car keys! I hid them, remember? You want me to drive you? This is as far as I know to go. You can stop. Stop! I think that's close enough. I have to get down there! What's down there? I have to get down there! No, I think now would be an excellent time to wake up! I have to get down there. Allison, hey, hey! Wake up! Oh, boy. Sorry! Just know that I love you. Allison! There's a car down here! Oh, boy. License plate says "Church 1"! Greydon Church. Oh, boy. If this is him, he's dead! Is there a little boy with him? Hold on! No! I don't see anyone! I think I may have found that $15 million you've been looking for. Whatever you can't move to this afternoon, move to tomorrow. Tell the rest of the guys I-I'll be in, um, after lunch. Yeah. We're at the pediatrician's right now. Okay, thanks. Lonely place to die. That car could have sat there for months if you didn't find it. What was he doing out here? Do you think his ex was right? Do you think he was trying to run off? If he was, he was doing it alone. We've combed through a hundred yards of desert in each direction, and there's nothing to suggest that a second body was thrown clear of Church's car. Is there anyway that his son could have walked away? The passenger door was pinned against the side of the embankment. No tracks, no blood trail. Detective Scanlon? This was found in Church's CD player. Did you enjoy your cigarette, Mr. Church? I hope so. You have 45 minutes to respond to this message, and your time starts now. If you ever care to see your son again, gather that $15 million you keep lying around in cash and bearer bonds, and drive out on the 10. Exit onto Rural Route 96. There's a gas station just north of Saxonburg. Park and wait for further instruction. Do not alert your staff. Do not alert the authorities. You have 45 minutes to appear. If you do not appear in 45 minutes I will sever one finger from your son's left hand. Every ten minutes you keep me waiting, I will remove another finger. When I run out of fingers, I will start on his toes. You have already lost one minute. That has to be someone who worked for me, or... works for me. He knows too much. The smoking, the apocalypse money... Apocalypse money? He always kept it around, kept it close, big duffel full of cash and bonds, for when the apocalypse came. Or terrorists... I used to kid him about it. What's the smoking thing? He quit for seven months when Justin was born, but he fell off the wagon. He was bound and determined that his son never know, never see him do it, so he used to sneak out. "Just give me four minutes," he used to say. "Just four minutes." So, uh... whoever it was, knew... knew that he had four minutes in and out, to take the boy... ...leave the disc. All right, we got a little boy to find. You know what you need to do. Pray? That CD is three days old. Nonetheless. And you and your husbandshould head home. Get some sleep, you've done what you can here. You sure? Have you looked at yourself? You're exhausted. Besides, you're the only person I can honestly say is more effective when they're asleep than when they're awake. It's 7:00 p.m., and the Big Dog is not here. The Big Dog is not anywhere and the Range Rover's missing. Nice to have you back. Sleep well? I don't know. I keep seeing the same thing. When I'm awake, when I dream. It's Calley. It's that, it's the moment he discovers that Church is missing. I, I just can't figure out why I keep seeing it. Great, you're here. Just one sec. Is this her? That's her. Oh, my God. She's just a kid. Yeah, but watch this. Give me one $20 instant pick. $20, huh? Gonna be a mega-idiot. Shut up. All right, what's my first number? This is stupid. Let's just buy some beer. Forget this. I know he's over 21, but I need to see your ID, miss. - What's the matter with you? Give me a number. - Leave her alone. 11. All right, she's doing it. 11. 23. 14. 38. 32. All right. 11, 23, 14, 38, 32. The governor says thanks. Why? How much did I win? You won me and a six-pack of beer. Let's go. Wait a minute. You just lost me 20 bucks, twerp. What are you blaming her for? She's just a little kid. You're the idiot that plays the lottery. Did Ariel say anything to you? No. Why? I don't know. She just seemed awfully quiet at dinner. It's starting. What's starting? She's living her own life. She's... making her own memories. Keeping her own secrets. She's walking home from school. She's not backpacking across Europe with some guy named Sven. You joke. I miss her. She's right next door. Hang on one second. Someone's at the door. Hey. Uncle Calley? Allison. Allison. Allison! Mommy? What were you doing? It's okay. I'm awake now. It's Devalos. He has news. Calley shot the kidnapper. Justin's safe. I know. I was there. I'll get the pills. It's 7:00 p.m., ananthe Big Dog is not here. Big Dog is not anywhere, and the Range Rover is missing. Oh, my God. Not again. No, no. Shh! It's okay. I'm awake, I swear. Go back to sleep. I couldn't figure out why it kept showing me the same moment over and over again, and then... Wait. Who kept showing you what moment? Church. He kept showing me the moment when Calley discovered that he and the boy were gone. Except Calley never mentioned the boy. I'm sorry? It's always "The Big Dog" is gone. The Big Dog. Church. Not the Big Dog and his son. It's because Calley already knew the son was gone. Because Calley and the man he was talking to had already snatched him. I think I speak for everyone when I offer my heartfelt thanks for your extraordinarily brave rescue of Justin Church early this morning. Obviously, since a homicide was involved, there are some facts we'll need to sort through. And, since you've waived your right to have an attorney present, I promise to make this as quick and as painless as possible. Can you tell us something about your relationship with the apparent kidnapper-- Mr. Tracy Oppen? Yes. Mr. Church asked me to let him go last January. Bad attitude. They had had words. And I understand he was still carrying copies of keys to the house? I turned everything over to the detective. So you went through your records-- everyone who had worked for Mr. Church-- and there was just something about Mr. Oppen? It was an instinct more than anything, I suppose. I remembered hearing that he lived in the desert, and then we were in the desert yesterday morning with Mr. Church. I decided to go out there. Must have heard my truck coming because he was standing outside when I pulled in. Outside? Hang on one second. Someone's at the door. Really? The minute he saw me, he turned and ran back inside. I just knew in my bones he was going for a gun, so, once he was down, I went inside to look for Justin. I wasn't sure what I'd find, but he was right there. Nothing missing. I picked him up and I took him to hospital as fast as I could. Simple as that, really. You're very fond of Justin, aren't you? Of course. And I know you would never do anything to cause him any real harm. And I know you were very fond of his father. In fact, you were devoted to him. You had no way of knowing that his car would go over that cliff. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I haven't slept. Uh... I'm not sure I understand where this is going. We were just wondering about the phones. The phones? We have a witness who says Oppen was on the phone when you shot him. Well, that's absurd. I saw no phone. There certainly were no witnesses. This witness also says you stopped on the way to the hospital and threw something away. Again, there were no witnesses, there were no phones. Mr. Calley, this witness led us to the place where he says you deposited this trash. This is ridiculous. Inside, two disposable cell phones-- the kind you get at a convenience store. Cheap, hard to trace. One of them has Mr. Oppen's fingerprints all over it. You were on the other, talking to him. Hang on one second. Someone's at the door. You were talking to him because he was your accomplice. The two of you had a plan, and it would have worked, if only Mr. Church hadn't been in such a hurry and gone off that road. And if only our witness hadn't heard Mr. Oppen on the telephone, and then seen you throw those phones away. This is absurd. I had no accomplice. I don't know anything about any phones, and I can assure you there is no witness. Really? Are you calling Justin Church a liar? Hey, hey, hey! Easy! Whoa! Take it easy. Mr. Calley, you're under arrest for the kidnapping  of Justin Church and the murder of Tracy Oppen. Detective Scanlon, read him his rights. Hi. Well, hi. Hannah sick? You guys have a fight? What's the deal? I don't know. I just don't want to walk home anymore. I want to ride home with you. I want it back the way it was. Wow. Me, too. Good. If only life worked that way. What do you mean? You can ride home with me. You can always ride home with me. But you can't undo whatever it is that happened. What makes you think something happened? Well, something must have happened to make you not want to walk home when it was so important to you a few days ago. Was it something dangerous? Was it something scary? Just something upsetting. Yeah. Life is full of those. All right, then. Here's what we can do. I can drive you home. I can drive you home for the rest of your life if you want. Of course, you might lose a friend. And you might miss out on one or two really wonderful experiences. Or you can walk home with Hannah-- your friend. And when you get home, you can tell me-- your mother-- exactly what happened to make you feel that way. 'Cause, honey, even if I don't drive you home, I will always be waiting there for you. See you at 4:00. Maybe even earlier. Oh, no! She's not coming back again, is she?
