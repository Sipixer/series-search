District Attorney Devalos. No, no. I know he's not at work yet, that's why I'm calling you. That's why I'm asking for his home number. No, please don't put me on... hold. Hey! There's only four Heart-a-Bear cards in here. Daddy! Hold on, Bridge. Uh, nature of my business? My wife works for him. She works in that office. I really need to speak with him. Yes, of course, I'll hold again. Where is my hair scrunchie and where's Mommy? Uh, Mom-- Mom had to go in to work early today. Yeah, no, I know it's an unlisted number. That's... I have it here somewhere, I just can't find it. Daddy, is something going on? You're acting like something's going on. Huh? No, sweetie, everything's fine. Nothing's going on. Daddy's just looking for a number. Uh, help your sister with her, uh... stuff. I'll be right with you. Why are yodoing this in the kitchen? You're going to get food all over everything. I have to get finished. I have seven boyfriends this year. And that's a lot of cards. Valentine's Day is a manufactured holiday invented by greeting card companies to trick dumb third graders into buying Heart-a-Bear cards. That's a lie! Bridge, hold on. I can't hear. Yeah. Yes, it's an emergency, but it's not a 911 emergency, it's personal. Valentine's Day is real. Send a card to your friends who are boys, and if you get one back they're your true love. Really? Your true love? Because he gives you a card? I don't think so. You know what? Forget it. I found it. Valentine's Day is for real. Isn't it, Daddy? Yeah, Bridge. Of course, Bridge. Yeah, I got a call from the D.A., told me you had a bit of a situation, asked me to come by. Yeah, I appreciate it, Detective. It's a little crazy around here. Let's go on the patio. Hi, Detective Scanlon. Is my mom with you? No, honey, I'm actually here to see your Daddy. Daddy, is everything okay? Everything's fine, pumpkin. Just look after your sister for me for a second. We got an APB out on your car, we got the phone company monitoring your cell in case she uses it to call somebody. At this point, it's really just a matter of time. Okay. I gotta get the kids to school, and act... act like nothing's happened. Uh, if you find her, call me on Allison's cell? I'm gonna take that with me. Sure. She was perfectly lucid, just... someone else. Look, get your kids to school. The second we locate her, I'll call you. All right. Tom? Tom? Dora? Es usted, Se√±ora O'Bannon? Uh, yeah-- um... How the hell do you say, "in the kitchen?" Uh... En lacocina, Dora! (speaking Spanish) (speaking Spanish) Slow down, Dora. I'm still learning here. It's Spanish 101. What is it? (speaking Spanish) Dora. What is it? What's happened? Policia, emergency. 2323 Glendale Lane. Okay. Out, you two. Love you. Bye, Dad. Bye. Love you, Dad. Hello? Told you it wouldn't take long. Two patrols responded to a B&E on Glendale Lane. ID'd your car in the driveway. She was breaking and entering? The maid found her in the Missus' clothes eating ice cream in the kitchen. What? She was so convincing, the cops didn't know who to arrest at first, Allison or the maid. The maid could produce ID. This woman, the one who's clothes that she's wearing, she wouldn't happen to have died recently, would she? First thing I checked. Very much alive. Can I talk to her? Yeah. Have you called my husband yet? I sure did. You again! Officer, this is the man I was telling you people about. He got me drunk. I don't know, maybe even drugged me. Brought me back to his house, then wouldn't let me leave. He has my purse, my phone, my ID. Honestly. I don't know who to press charges against first, him or that crazy housekeeper. Of course I can always fire her ass. Unfortunately, degenerate Mr. Mom over here doesn't work for me. Stop it. Excuse me, do you know who you're speaking to? Enough! You can't do that. You can't be that way. Not while you look like that. Not while you're... wearing my wife. He's a whack job. You can see that, right? I said enough! You talk like a piece of trash. You act like a spoiled brat. You are a repugnant human being and I need you to go back to wherever you came from and give me back my wife. I demand you remove this man. I demand that you wake up! You wake up! You're crazy! He's crazy. Isn't this the part where the doctors... or Ashton Kutcher, or someone comes in and... Listen to me. Listen to me. Your name is Allison Dubois. You are a wife. A mother. You have three children. Sometimes you see dead people. Any of this sound familiar? You are prone to psychic episodes. I think this may be one of them. And we have to get it to end. Somehow... you have to make it to end. If you could just call my husband, Tom. I am your husband. I'm your husband. Me. Why don't you step outside and give me a minute with her. Okay. That man is certifiable. That man is a husband worried about his wife. He may be someone's husband. He's certainly not mine. Okay. You're Sandra O'Bannon. You're not married, are you, Detective? No, Ma'am. I didn't think so. 'Cause you are not yet exasperating. You still listen. I'm all ears now, Sandra. Tell me about yourself. My husband is Dr. Thomas O'Bannon. We live at 2323 Glendale Lane. I can give you all my contact numbers. In a minute. Tell me about the last thing you remember. Tell me about last night. Everything that happened before you woke up this morning. I don't know... I went out. Out where? The Spotted Pony. The bar on Mesa? Were you drinking, Sandra? No, I was turning tricks. Of course I was drinking. I was at a bar. Heavily? Look... Yesterday I found out that my husband was having an affair. One minute we're planning a getaway for Valentine's Day... the next I discover that he is sleeping with someone else. Yes. Heavily. The answer to the question is "heavily." Do you actually remember going home with Mr. Dubois? I have done a lot of incredibly stupid things in my marriage, issued a lot of really wicked threats, but I have never cheated on my husband. Never. Would you do something for me, Sandra? If you stop saying my name like you're humoring a small child. Go over there. Tell me what you see when you look in the mirror. Humor me. What do you want to know? Describe yourself. Okay, I'm five eight. Stylish looking. Interesting looking. Pretty, sometimes. Maybe not today. I have my father's eyes... brown. My mother's nose, thin. Boobs courtesy of my husband. My hair is a mess. But Geoffrey can fix that, if I can convince him to fit me in this week. Uh, sorry, what color did you say it was again? Why, you like it? My hairdresser calls it Burnt Auburn. This is not from a bottle. ? The house Allison broke into this morning is owned by a Dr. Thomas O'Bannon and his wife Sandra. He's a surgeon. She's wealthy in her own right. Richer than God, actually. Inherited a fortune from her Daddy. Married six years. That's all she wrote. Have we been able to reach them? Talked to the husband's office this morning, they say he's on vacation next week. Apparently they have a house outside of Prescott. No phones, no cell reception. Well, once we do get a hold of them, I'm sure I can make these breaking and entering charges go away. The problem is, until we get a hold of them I can't just let her walk free. Wait a second, you mean, she's gotta stay in jail until... Actually I had another thought. What, no, no, no, that... This can't be happening. Listen to me. I can't imagine that in her present state you're anxious to have her at home. I don't think she'd go willingly anyway... and it's probably not smart or safe to have her around the children. And frankly, legally, we have no choice. She committed a crime. I'm gonna pull some strings and have her remanded to a state mental facility. Are you serious? I know she'll be far more comfortable and she'll be treated far more humanely than if she were in jail. The second she's feeling better... the second she knows she's Allison Dubois. I'll go before a judge and get her out of there. I don't know. It's not like we really have any choice, Joe. All right then, Mr. Dubois. Why don't you say your good-byes and we'll get Mrs. Dubois settled in. She prefers to be called Mrs. O'Bannon. It is my name, after all. I'll make a note of it. I'm really hoping this is only gonna last for a day or two. Everyone assured me that the second you're back to your old self... Listen to me. I don't know who you are or how you got all these people to believe your crazy story. You can't hold me prisoner forever. My husband will find me. He will get me out. And when he does, I will see to it that you pay for everything that you've done. All of you. Hey, Dad. Where's Mom? What's going on? How come you're picking us up? It's nice to see you, too. You're not walking today? I wanted to talk to mom about something. Is she still at work? Well, actually mom had to go on a little trip for work. But she didn't even say good-bye! Yeah, I know and she feels really badly about that. You all buckled up? Mm-hmm. So, can I call her? Actually she's flying. She's in the air right now and... and she's not gonna land until late tonight. And then she's in a different time zone so it's gonna be tricky. So it's just gonna be us for a couple of days. And I'm gonna need your help, okay? Sure, Dad. Okay. I just wanted to make sure that she was settled in for the night. Okay... good. Um, what time would you suggest that I call in the morning? Okay. Thank you, nurse. Yeah, hello. So, Mom went on a business trip? She didn't take her cell phone? She must have forgotten it. Forgot her phone. Didn't say goodbye. Dad, is Mom okay? Your mom is fine, Ariel. She really is. And I promise you... she's gonna be back soon. So, now go to bed. Stop it, Tom! Stop what? Not talking to me. Fine. I'll speak. Gee, Sandra, I sure loved getting up in the middle of the night, and driving down to the Spotted Pony, and scraping my drunken wife off a bar room floor. All right! I've changed my mind; you can shut up again. Yeah, I just love that. Well, I bet it wasn't half as much fun as finding out your husband was cheating on you. Two days before Valentine's Day, no less. Where the hell are we? This is the road to the cabin. And if you think I'm driving to get you, driving you all the way back home, and then turning around and coming back to the cabin in the morning, you're crazy. Light that up in here and I will break your hand. One puff. And I promise I'll put it out. I can count to one, Tom. Oh, you unbelievable ass! It's burning the upholstery! Holy! ff the phone with the Prescott Police. Asked them to send a uniform up to the O'Bannon's place in the mountains. No one was there. In fact, they never showed. Never showed? Not to be morbid but we've got to be thinking the same thing here. That maybe those two had a little accident on the way to their cabin, and now they're both, uh... no longer with us? Maybe one of them is with us. Spending a little time with my wife. Look at the bright side-- at least you didn't wake up as Mr. O'Bannon. At any rate, I'm going to, uh... start checking with hospitals along the route. Hey, uh, can you hold on one second? I got another call coming in. Dubois residence. Mr. Dubois? The doctor has examined your wife Allison. And he asked me to call and report to you that she is awake, and lucid, and has been asking to see you. Wait a second, uh, to see me? Or her, uh... her other husband? You are Joe Dubois? Yes. Well, then you're the one she's asking for. Hey. Husband. Al? Joe. Allison. Allison, Allison, Allison It's so good to have you back. Joe. Joe. Joe. It's so good to be back. Mr. Dubois? I'm almost done here. Um, could I borrow your cell phone? Check my voicemail? Yes, I need the number for Prescott General Hospital, Patient Information. Yes. I need information on a patient named Thomas O'Bannon. Would have been admitted night before last. Yes. You. Well, don't just stand there! Open the door! Yes, ma'am. I need you to take me to Prescott General Hospital, now. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Okay. Thomas O'Bannon? Room 116. Tom! Thank goodness. I was worried you were really hurt. I'm sorry. Are you talking to me? Tom, it's me. Tom? Who's your friend? Or have we met already? I'm sorry, I've been a little hazy since the accident, but... the doctors and Tom assure me that it will all come back to me. And you are? I'm Sandra. I'm Tom's wife. And you are? She's no one we know, dear. But thank you for your concern, miss. Tell you what I know. Someone matching Allison's description took a town car from the state mental health facility where you were, and asked to be driven to Prescott General Hospital. I'm about to drive out there and find out what I can. I'll call you as soon as I know anything. Thank you, Detective. Girls, pizza's here! Everyone wash their hands! Hey, husband. Please. I need you. I need your help. I don't have anyone else to ask. I don't know where to go. Go talk to your husband. Happy Valentine's Day. Oh, yeah. Right. Happy Valentine's Day. Hey, Mommy's home! Mommy's home! Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Mom! Mom! Dad! I'm sorry. There's no way I can pull this off. They're gonna know instantly that I'm not your wife, that I'm not their mother. Okay, you want to figure this thing out? You want to get to the bottom of this thing? We can't do it from here. I promise you, this will work. It's Valentine's Day. Every year, Allison and I go out to dinner on Valentine's Day. We just got to go out there, say good night, and then we're out the door and in the car. I don't know. I don't know if I can do it. I don't know about these clothes. ? Do you buy it? Hmm? I guess it's kind of Valentine-y. Um... Really? Yeah. You know that's gonna make this dress a lot less exciting. That's okay. We have three kids. That's plenty of excitement. All right. All right. I can do this. Just remember, it's Arianna, Belinda, Sheree. Ariel, Bridgette and Marie. Maybe I'll just call them "girls." Okay, kids, Mommy and I are going out for a special Valentine's Day dinner. Ariel, you're the boss. You're kidding! But Mommy just got home! And I haven't even shown her the cards I got. And she hasn't given us hers. I know. It sucks, right, girls? So how was your trip, Mom? Where'd you go? What'd you do? You know what? I would love to know the answer to that, too. But if we don't go right now, we're gonna lose our reservation, so... Didn't you need your cell phone? You left it here. Your pse, too. That's another excellent question. Boy, we got a lot to talk about at dinner. Bye, guys. What about kisses? Later, promise. Bye... bye, girls. Something's just not right. I need to check on some things at my house. Mmm. What do you mean? What things? We're not gonna get in any trouble are we? It's the maid's night off. My husband's still in the hospital. I think we'll be fine. I just, I need to try to find out... more about her. She must be very rich. Turns out, Tom likes rich. Which is funny, because he didn't in the beginning. Which is why I think I found him so damn attractive. He wouldn't let me buy dinner. He wouldn't let me pay for a drink. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Everyone likes rich. At least, once they've had a... free sample. Was she there today at the hospital? That's the weird thing. I was there. And you should have seen us together. He was so tender, in a way that he hasn't been in years. It was as if... I don't even know how to describe it. It was as if all of the bad parts of our marriage were just knocked right out of us in that car crash and some lighter, happier version of Tom and me just walked right out of the wreckage. The only problem is... I'm part of the baggage that got left behind. Just... take Scottsdale Road, and I'll guide you from there. It's nothing. It's Mommy's cell. I can't believe she's still running around without it. Hey, this is Allison. Leave a message at the tone. Hey. H. Uh... I don't know where you are, but it's Valentine's Day. So Happy Valentine's day. You know, I got to tell you, hearing that message, the one before the beep, that was the highlight of my day. At least I know that that's you. Good God almighty, Allison. Where are you? I miss you. Mrs. O'Bannon? I'm up here! It's been going on for years. There are letters in that box from 2004. Receipts forifts he bought her with my money. Cars. Jewels. How could I not have known? I'm truly sorry. But we probably ought to get going. It's late. My kids have school tomorrow. I don't want to go anywhere. I want to sleep in my own bed. I have a horrible feeling it's gonna be the last time. Here's the thing. I can't go home without you. My kids will definitely know something's up. I want to help you figure this thing out, I do, but we have to go back to my place. Oh, my, is that the line you used on me at the Spotted Pony? Now, isn't Abigail old enough to watch the others overnight? Ariel. Uh, no. That doesn't work. It's a school night. Allison and I... So, wait. The two of you have never gone out and said, "Oh, screw it. Let's stay out all night and party?" Ah...that's hard to explain. But for me, uh... being with Allison is the party. And for, Allison... there's kind of no better place to have a party than at home with the kids. God... I would die to feel that way about someone... some place. I would die... to have someone feel that way about me. We really ought to get going. So how are we going to do this? What's that? The bed thing. I realize that we've already slept together. Don't worry. These things have a way of working themselves out. No, no, no, no. That's not the answer I'm looking for. Oh... You take the Bridgette side. I'll take the Marie side. I'm sure you'll feel very safe. Holy! Son of a bitch that hurt. Now would be a good time to come out of the woods and give me a hand. Please don't raise your voice to me. I've been sitting in this scary forest in the dark since you dropped me off three hours ago. I'm not in the mood. Hey. I just slammed myself into a tree at 35 miles an hour on purpose so you could have weekend houses and foreign cars. Let's not compare moods. Give me a hand with her. Grab her legs. There you go. Come on. Just drag her. Okay... we both know what to do. I'll uncover the grave... and we'll both lower her in. What are you doing? Why are you turning away from me? I've seen your body. Hell, I made it. Not to mention your face. It's not you, it's her. I think she's still alive. Huh? Nothing's ever easy with you dear, is it? Not that this isn't a lovely stretch of road or anything, but I'm still a little fuzzy as to what we're doing here. That's the spot. Right there. Don't forget the shovel. Okay. So we're here? No. No, we're not. What is it? What are you looking for? Thank you. What did you just say? I said, "thank you." Sorry. It just slipped out. Give me a minute. I'll talk trash... behave like a spoiled brat. Go back to being the repugnant human being that you've come to know and love. That's okay. "Thank you" works, too. What? Oh. Oh. That's you, isn't it? No... no, no, not now. No, not yet. I don't want it to be over. I've still have so much to do, so much to learn. Hey, Allison? Allison? Sandra? Allison? Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? I feel kind of whoozy. You were unconscious for a while there. You scared the crap out of me. How did I get here, Joe? You don't remember? Last thing I remember I was... getting a box of Valentine cards for Bridge. Do you think we're gonna be here for long? I still have to get something for you. In a bizarre story, prominent plastic surgeon Dr. Tom O'Bannon was charged with the murder of his wife today after he confessed to staging a car accident. It was all part of a plot to murder Mrs. Sandra Pinzler O'Bannon, heir to the Pinzler oil fortune. The couple, seen here in their wedding photo, were apparently on the verge of divorce when the murder took place. Prosecutors believe that in order to maintain access to his wife's inheritance, Dr. O'Bannon concocted a bizarre plan to have another woman impersonate her. According to the indictment, over the last year and a half Dr. O'Bannon performed multiple plastic surgeries on his co-conspirator and lover, Lisa Wolfe, until she was virtually indistinguishable from his wife. Ms. Wolfe, seen here on the right in a picture taken shortly after her arrest today, is being held without bail. Had the ruse been successful, Mrs. O'Bannon's fortune... Still getting caught up on current events, I see. Well, I did lose three whole days of my life, you know? Hmm, believe me, I know. Speaking of which... um, about Valentine's Day... Oh yeah. Thank you. For what? When all this started, I really hadn't had a chance to get you anything. I mean, I was going to. What are you talking about? I got your valentine. I just checked my voicemail. Now, don't you want to know what I have for you? Sure. Don't just sit there.
