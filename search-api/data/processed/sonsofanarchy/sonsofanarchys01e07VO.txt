No problem. Where's the Cutlass? - It's at the hospital. - Still not running right? It's running okay. This worry I'm getting here. Have anything to do with that car that's been following us? The compact parked halfway down the block. What the hell's going on? That ATF agent that's been looking into you guys. I think he's here for me. - What are you talking about? - I was with him in Chicago. It got violent. I tried to end it. He started stalking me. - Don't. He's dangerous. - Go back inside, Tara. Lock the door. Vandalism, deadly weapon. That's six months in County, asshole. Violating a restraining order. You'll be in the cell next to me. They teach you how to suck a dick in ATF school? Badass biker. You guys gave it your best shot. You got nothing on Sam Crow. And you harassing Tara. That ends here. Or next time it won't be your piece of shit car I'm draining fluid from. You threatening a federal agent? I'm threatening you. Go away. It's my last warning. You'd better rein in your ATF boyfriend. Agent Kohn isn't on my payroll. I don't keep tabs. Well, maybe you should. He's not here for Sam Crow, Hale. He's here for Tara. - What the hell are you talking about? - This guy was stalking her in Chicago. Thinks she came back to Charming to be with me. I'm telling you: this guy is nuts and he's going to hurt her. Jesus Christ. That's who she had a restraining order against. You knew? No, but it makes sense now. Hale. Let's go, hotshot. Water and Power just dug up some old bones out on 44. Be there in a minute. Kohn is my problem. I will handle it. You'd better, man, or I'm gonna. Half-Sack, bomaye. Get in there, kid. - My money's on Lowell. - Now you're getting cocky. Anyone can beat up a junkie, prospect. Doesn't mean shit. Where'd you learn to fight like this? I was Junior Lightweight Champion, - Armed Forces Boxing Competition. - That's so hot. Things all better with the little missus now? My balls are still attached. Shit, Lowell, get out of there. - Whose idea was this? - Bobby's. I don't I don't mind it, Clay. - I'm just... helping Half-Sack train. - Well, you killed enough brain cells. Come on, come on. Back to work. Thanks. - How's he doing? - The latest round of rehab seems to be sticking. He hasn't missed any work. If I could get AA to kick up a vig, Lowell could make us all rich. He's always been a freak. He's a damn good mechanic. I guess you taught him that. How's Sugar Ray One-Nut looking? He's wicked fast. He's got a great right hook. How much money gets thrown around at these bare-fist things? The purse is okay, but it's the betting that's gone crazy. I know a couple of guys last year, made six figures each. - Really? - The prospect could knock those lightweights out any day of the week. Absolutely. What'd we pull together for McKeavy? 120. You ain't thinking about betting on the prospect? You know, if Half-Sack takes his first five fights and looks strong going into the finish, we control how it ends. Could be a huge payday. What do you think? I don't know. But I do know there's no way we're raising 80 grand in the next four days, so... Might be our only shot. - I'm in. - I'm in. Done. All right, I'm in. Take 50 grand. I want to see it triple. You're going to train him. No booze, no weed, no pussy. That include the Nevada sweetbutt? Until I'm up a hundred K, ***the Nevada sweetbutt*** can cool on the counter. Bobby. Do me a favor. Push up on that thing, will you? - Really? - Really. Halfy-Sacky's all about that now. I want to see if she's all about him. And go at it hard. - I ain't mad at that. - Half-Sack's going to lose his mind. Well, that kind of anger we can really use. Call Unser, see if he wants in on some of this fight action. Clay, he's out on the job. Water and Power dug up some old bones this morning. - Where? - Out on 44. What? Wheeling out two bodies. Should be three. - I'm afraid to ask. - Don't be. There it is. Was this us? Shit. Episode 107: Old Bones All three of them were Mayans? Back in '92, Mexicans tried to expand their Oakland dope base. Set up a charter in Lodi. We couldn't let that happen. Was a bloody two years. Bodies dropped. I remember. That was right around the time my old man died. That's right. We got to stop the PD from IDing those bodies, man. I mean, if they flag the Mayans, we're their next stop. We can pull teeth to stop the ID, but they can still DNA test. Forensic tests on three bodies? That would blow half of Unser's yearly budget. But if Hale thought it would hurt us, he could get his new fed buddies to float the cost. Shit, man, that was pre-O.J., right? I mean, we weren't thinking about DNA, right, back in '93. What kind of clues we got buried with those Mexicans? If they don't know they're Mayans, they won't take it any further. We stop the identification. We stop the investigation. There's a $15K purse on the line... and a lot of ringside action. I'm ready. This ain't no Army boxing, kid. This is street brawling. No, it's cool. Cherry Pie. - What? - It's time to go. What are you talking about? Go where? - What are you doing, Bobby? - Relax, prospect. She's going to stay with him till the fight. No, I'm not. - Oh, yeah, you are. - Why? No booze, no dope. No pussy. - You'll love my place. Very cozy. - Get your hands off me. - Quarantine. - Back off! Clay, you know, no... sex before a fight's like an old wives' thing, man. Did you just insult my old lady again? Jump him. Why didn't you tell me it was Kohn? Jax told you? I did not know that Kohn was the guy that was stalking you. - I could have... - I tried getting help in Chicago. Complained to his superiors. Made things worse. I went through three precincts before someone'd even give me that restraining order. Doubted you could do anything. Kohn's boss doesn't even know that he is here. This guy is in deep shit. He is done. Really? He is leaving Charming. I promise. And I am sorry. Town's talking about the skulls that rolled out of that hole. I'm sure they are. You thought about damage control? Tig's the only one who knows the truth. Everybody else thinks all those bodies are Mayans. And how do you stop that truth from spreading? I got it covered. All right? Don't worry. This shit stays in the rearview. I talked to Trammel. Sanwa County Coroner's clearing space, but bones stay local tonight. Good. Now I have to get into the lower level of the hospital. You... think the old squeeze might be able to hook a brother up? - I'll see what I can do. - Alright. Sorry, Clay. I just asked Gemma, just wanted to make sure it was okay that I have Moby here only during my break. He likes to watch me work. Sure. That's fine. You're doing good work. Thanks, man. All right, Tara's not here. - What do you want to do? - Lab coat on the chair. You distract the doctors. Yeah, not a problem. Excuse me, ladies. How you doing? You're doctors, both of you? Thank God. Doberman pinscher, you know, took a chunk... - Jesus Christ. No, hang out. - Took a chunk out of my ass. - Can we... - You need to go to the ER. Distract them. I said distract them, not scar them for life. No, shit, I'm serious. Man, I think it's infected. ***A man *** just steal a key card from an intern. Hopefully it gets us below. Me and Tig'll take care of this. Why don't you stay here and run interference. Why? Kid looks strong, huh? You have a good night, all right? You, too. Nurse said you wanted to see me. I was just checking in. You okay? I talked to Hale. He assured me Joshua was leaving. Thanks for... handling that. You're welcome. You won't have to worry about that guy anymore. H, I, J, K... L, M, N, O, P... Q, R, S... T, U, V... W, X, Y, and Z... - I'll find us some gloves. - Okay. Freako. - We ain't here to find you a date. - I know. I know, it's just... you know. You ever...? What? - Cold-pack? - Yeah. No. Not my thing. I know it's a little bit creepy at first. But then something happens, man. I'm telling you. This soothing coldness, the stillness, I mean, it's really a beautiful thing. Please, please, stop. Goddamn it. It's all right. I thought I told you to wait upstairs. There's no interference to run. And I figured you could use the extra pair of hands. Is that all right? I got 'em. All three. Hold the head. Tight. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait a minute. It's already been ID'd. Lowell Harlan, Senior. This is Lowell's old man. Cookie time. I made 'em. Especially for you. No, thank you. Stop. Please. Come on, girl. You ain't no old lady yet. You... do this for me... I'll make sure that you get the thumbs-up from Clay. - Stop, okay? Please. - Come on. Stop! I'm not a sweetbutt! - Yeah, you are. - No, I'm not. I came here for Kip. I'm not gonna be passed around anymore, all right? I'm done with that. - Come on. - Seriously! Jesus! Okay. Okay? I said... "Okay." Relax. Have a cookie. Why was Lowell's dad buried with the enemy? Casualty of war. Mayans took him out. - He worked at T-M. He wasn't patched. - Mayans went after everybody. Family, friends, didn't matter. Lowell thinks his dad just split. Poor bastard's convinced he's still out there. I know. So, why the same grave? A disrespect. I know. It was a crazy two years. I didn't have time to think a lot of shit through. Is that why you didn't want me in the morgue? Protect that secret? I got no secrets from you. You know, with the Mayans ID'd, too, I can only imagine the poison Hale's gonna pour on Lowell's ear. I'll handle Lowell. Sounds good. Is it cool if I work on it before my shift? Is everything okay, man? I want you to hear this from me. What? Something happen to Moby? - I left him with Neeta... - No, your kid's fine. Those bodies they pulled out of the hole on 44. One of them's your old man. My dad? That don't make sense. I'm sorry, son. No, he ran off when I was like, 15. He just split. Everyone told me that. You told me that. I know. Well... son of a bitch was already dead to me, right? What... what happened to him? Mayan war. Wrong place, wrong time. The other bodies they found in the hole was two Mexicans who killed your dad. Vengeance was meted out. The cops... They're gonna try to lay all those bodies at Sam Crow's feet. - That's bullshit. - I know. It ain't a matter of true or false. Hale is gonna try to screw with your compass. I don't want you losing true north. Inside the club, there had to be truth. Our word was our honor. But outside, it was all about deception. Lies were our defense, our default. To survive, you had to master the art of perjury. The lie and the truth had to feel the same. But once you learn that skill, nobody knows the truth, in or outside the club. Especially you. My God... Holy shit! The two bodies were Mayan captains. It had to be Sam Crow. Yeah, well, 15-year-old Mexican bones give us nothing. Even with DNA, there's no murder weapon so it's ancient history. The US Attorney's Office won't touch it. Look at this. Dead mechanic worked for Teller-Morrow. History of drug abuse, domestic violence... his kid's on the way in. Following his old man's footsteps, close to Sam Crow. - How close? - Not sure. Any word on Kohn? Checked out of his hotel, turned in his rental car. He may already be gone. Here we go. - You, wanted to see me? - Yeah. Have a seat, Lowell. I'm June Stahl, federal agent. I'm here helping out the deputy chief. Yeah? Helping out with what? We have some sad news for you about your father. Yeah, I know. They found him in that hole off of 44. Well, you don't seem too surprised by that, Lowell. - You live by the sword, you know? - He was a mechanic, not a gangster. - Why was he buried with outlaw bikers? - I don't know. Your old man worked for Teller-Morrow, right? Yeah. So the Sons of Anarchy must've trusted him. He was a friend. Did Clay tell you that? It's true: he was a friend, and I'm a friend. Right, just like your dad. You're just a chip off the old spoon. Let's just hope we don't find you in a ditch on a county road somewhere? Who do you think killed him? You know they found three bullet holes in his head. Now, what could a mechanic do that would incite such a gruesome death? - I don't know. - He was buried with the enemy, Lowell. He was not a friend. He did something to piss off Clay. No. He was in the same grave because he had the same killers. Use your head, Lowell. - Sam Crow killed your father. - That is not true! Yes, it is. What's going on in here? Who the hell are you? - ATF. - Just what we need. - You guys want to rent a goddamn wing? - Aren't you spunky. You done with him? For now. Get out of here, Lowell. Go ahead. Go on. Pleasure. It's bad enough I got to see the other one every time I get a hot shave. Now, I gotta deal with Mrs. ATF chewing on my last nerve? - When did you last see Kohn? - I just left him, at Floyd's. - Who did this? - ATF. Why? Tara. - That stupid bitch. - How is this her fault? - This guy's dead. - At least. Yeah. Kohn's still in town. I know. He's at Floyd's. I'm taking care of it. I'm taking care of it. I'm really going to miss this, Floyd. You want to go to war with me, you sick piece of shit? This is bullshit. He attacked me. No one backs your version, Kohn. He put me through a goddamn window. Right. Apparently after you stabbed him with some scissors. No. Don't think Jax is pressing charges. Shit! Great! Thank you. But you will be facing charges in Illinois for violating a restraining order. I'm not stalking Tara. I'm protecting her. Come on. We all know what happens if she hooks up with Teller. You know I'm right. We're all on the same team here. No, Josh. Not anymore. You're in breach of about a half dozen federal statutes. You've been stripped of your creds and OPR is going to meet you at O'Hare. I hope that the stalk was a good rush 'cause, it just killed your career. Wait. She came back here because she was afraid of me. I pointed her at Sam Crow. I can't fix that mistake, but you can both of you can. Please? Barber says you came in for a haircut. Agent Kohn attacked you with a pair of scissors, so you pushed him through a plate glass window. Self-defense. That's what Floyd saw. I guess that's what happened. That's fantastic. Tell me. Are they all just afraid of you or convinced that you are a necessary evil? You charging me? No charges. Why does Kohn have a hard-on for you? You know why. You're right, I do. Tara Knowles. The charming ingenue. - High school sweethearts, right? - Yeah. She fears for her life, so she comes back home to the only man she knows loves her enough to protect her. A guy who would have no problem putting a fed through a plate glass window. That's beautiful. Really, it is. I wish I had that kind of pull for someone. You're a lucky man. You done? Yeah, she's done. She's getting under his skin. I can feel it. It's bad for us. I'm keeping an eye on him. Not gonna let anything turn Jax away from Sam Crow, especially pussy. Tara's not pussy. He loved her. Probably still does. Neeta just called. Lowell, MIA. She just found Moby in the apartment crying, locked in the bathroom. Shit. Yeah, he probably went to Lodi looking to score. It's not your fault, baby. Been taking care of Lowell since he's 16. You've done everything you could. Just some shit you can't escape. It's like father, like son, - Yeah. - It looks like it's going that way. Gotta to rember what's important. Big picture. I'll call the Vista. See if he checked in. No one blames you if Lowell don't come home. Come on, Lowell. Open up. I'm taking you home. It makes no sense. It's no sense that my dad was buried with them wetbacks! How long have you been taking care of me, Clay? Why are you here now? I made a promise to your dad. What, before you killed him? You killed him, Clay. Why would you do that? I lied to you, son. Don't you call me that. I am not that. Your father wasn't killed by the enemy. - - He was the enemy. - No. He was a friend. He was a loathsome piece of shit. Treated you and your mother like dirt. Cared more about the crank than he did about his friends, his family. - Sound familiar? - I'm not that. No? Then what the hell are you? You can't stay clean! You abandoned your kid. Moby. I killed your old man. I killed him 'cause he was a rat. A weak, unkie rat. I'm not a rat. Look at you. Ten minutes with Hale, you turn inside out. You run away. You don't give a shit about your kid! I'm sorry, Clay. Next time maybe Moby drowns in that bathtub. Or maybe you tell Hale and the feds all those secrets you've been hearing at Teller-Morrow. I can't deal with it anymore, Clay. My point. Shit. I'm my old man. I'm Lowell. God. I'm sorry, Clay. I know that you tried to help me. You help Moby. You save him from me. Do it! Please. You help my little boy. This is it, prospect. The final fight. - How you feeling? - I'm good, man. - This asshole looks half dead. - Yeah, well, he's had a tougher climb. - It's a beautiful thing. - It is a beautiful thing. You're looking like a champ. Everybody's betting on you. Except for us. What do you mean? You want me to lose? Come on, man. I can beat this guy. I can win this whole thing. If you win this, we get 15 grand. You lose, we walk home with ten times that much, so you lose. You're gonna take a dive for the club. Go get him... sort of. Why aren't you at the fight? Had my share for today. Yeah. Your leg okay? Yeah. - Where's the doctor? - I don't know. Where you going with that, Jax? Nowhere. I don't believe that. I've seen the two of you together, see how you act around her. She's still got ties in you. You know what? I don't give a shit what you think. What I do, what Tara does... It's not your business. No, cleaning up piss and broken cribs... that's my business? No one asked you to take this on. This house, this kid. It's not your burden; it's mine. Shit. - You deal with that Lowell problem? - Call Neeta. Tell her she's gonna be watching Moby for a while. All right. Give it one more round. Then he falls. I understand you... declined Bobby's request for some comfort. Yeah, I did. I'm not about that anymore. And if I was to ask for some comfort... would you be about that? No. Sorry, but your old lady would turn us both into chum. You make a good point. If, Half-Sack patches in, which is a big if, it's all right with me if you stick around. That is, if he wants you as his old lady. Shit! Half-Sack, don't! What's he doing? What is he doing? Gonna KO this guy. Shit, I'll kill him. I'm gonna kill him. No, no, no. My bad. My bad. Get him out of there before we got to bury another Mexican. Come on. Hey,*** relax Clay, I'm really sorry. You know, I just lost it... I'm You owe the club 35K. - Really? - Yeah. At least you got the girl? Go on, get out of here before I rape both of you. - Ick. Hey! - Come on, come on. It's just an expression. A term of endearment. We're gonna need the 115 by Friday. It's gonna be a busy week. You said it. He's a good mechanic. Jesus, are you okay? Yeah. Hale told me what happened. Kohn's gone. I watched him leave town. Thank you. What is it? You left Chicago 'cause you were afraid this guy was gonna hurt you? One of the reasons. Did you come back here 'cause you knew I would hurt this guy? - Do what the cops wouldn't do? - God, no. And I had no idea he would follow me. I didn't know you'd even still be here. That doesn't sound like you, Jax. Sounds like your mother. Well, you're safe now. How'd it go, baby? Where is he? Sam Crow rehab. What did you tell Jax? About the bodies? Some of the truth. And Lowell? A little more. The rest stays buried. Yeah.
