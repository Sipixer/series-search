There's, like, pictures and journals. Things I never knew about him. I don't want the ghost of John Teller poisoning him, ruining everything we've built. You've got to nail Jax down. You have to nail him down hard, Clay. - Now what? - Abel stays in the toaster. We'll ship your ass off to rehab... again. I'm just saying, we should be cool with whatever this is around her. Because she's still in love with you? I want Op pulling the trigger on this. No mistakes. Shit. Munson, you're under arrest for the murder of Hefner. ATF says they got an eyewitness. Only two other guys were witness to that hit. - Where's Ope? - I checked Opie's finances. Somebody paid off a huge chunk of his debt, federal wire transfer. I figured the least I could do was pay off some of those big bills of yours. - You're setting me up as the rat. - What is going to happen when I put you and your family back in Charming? I'll tell the club the truth. I know how this looks. She set me up to look like a rat. It's all a lie. I don't know who the witness is, but it sure as shit ain't me. - Am I good with you, Clay? - Yeah. The truck, wired. Opie has turned on us. This has got to happen, Clay. His death never lands at our feet. The Mayans want guns. They want them right away. You and Tig pick up the money. Me and Jax drop off the guns. David, call him. Tell him to give them the cash. Laroy definitely double-crossed us. If the Niners are that pissed, and they bring their rage to Charming, I mean... They saw Opie's truck at the money drop. What, a drive-by? Got to be tonight. After the party. - Love you. - Love you back. Make it ghetto. Make it gangster. Shit. Oh, baby. Hey, Mary. Where is he? Outside. With the kids. It's good you're here, Mary. How are they doing? She's been crying all morning. Kenny still doesn't get it. Boys. Anything you need... I know. You want me to stick around? I'm okay. She knew. She knew I was gonna bring on something like this. Ope, you didn't bring this. A banger shot my wife. I had nothing to do with that? Can I help? Your upset last night. Was that our mistake? Jesus. And Jax? He knows what everybody else knows. Donna's death was Niner retaliation. Motherless children... They make people do drastic things. This is bad. You think I don't know that? You think I wanted this? You feel all that, baby. You feel it here. That's right. You walk out that door. You be the man they all need you to be. Jesus. - What's this? - Got a call from Lodi. A black Rover was jacked from a sports bar last night. Take Fain, see if anybody saw anything. We both know who was driving that SUV. We got no positive ID. This relationship you have with Clay, I don't like it. But I get it. You make a deal with the devil to keep the peace. But look at this. Look at what we let happen. An innocent woman was killed. I didn't let that happen. You're right. It's on me. But what was I supposed to do? Roll over and feed Sam Crow classified information? I get the rock and the hard place this all took you to. - Sorry this guilt comes down on you. - Okay, well, then help me. For once, please? Just help me serve justice to these guys. I should be fishing somewhere. Or reading a book, half-buzzed on vodka and lemonade. I'm still here, in this suit of mine, because I've got my own rock and hard place I'm living between. I ain't got much more of a run in me. Few years, maybe. Need something to leave Della, my half-smart kids. I'm sorry, son. Right. Without a witness, you'll never put this crime on Clay. But I doubt Jax would be party to anything that would hurt Opie. Maybe... we let the outlaws serve up their own justice. Food for thought. Riding through this world All alone God takes your soul You're on your own The crow flies straight A perfect line On the devil's bed Until you die Gotta look this life In the eye. Episode 113: The Revelator - Is he okay? - I can't get him to stop. He's fed, I changed him... - Where's Gemma? - On her way. Come on. What's all that fuss about, hmm? Here you go. Come on. You're all right, little dude. You're all right. I can't find the chapter on ex-junkie moms. I don't think our pages have been written yet, sweetheart. - What happened last night with us...? - It was a hard night, Wendy. The hell it was. I want this, Jax. He's your son. - You have him. - No, not just him. We've done our dance, Wendy. But never like this. Not with him. It can be different. We've been through way too much shit. I just want another chance. This little guy at least deserves that try, you know. Put together some time. All right? See where it goes. Okay, I will. I'm going to make this work, Jax. All clear. How is he? I don't know. How do you think he is? There's no viewing. The funeral's tomorrow. Let's get people down for this. A good show of support. Happy's already in town. I'll start making some calls. I got to take responsibility for this. I was the one who pushed for that deal with the Mayans. I knew there was going to be some kind of Niner blowback, but... I never thought it would reach this far, - go this way. - We all voted yes on that Mayan deal. - Nobody seen this coming. - That's right. Yeah, but it happened, so how do we handle it? The Niners are going to be dealt with. But right now let's just walk through this, be there for Ope. We help Ope by settling the score. We track down Laroy and put a bullet in that nigger's head. Now what are you looking at him for? - I'm the one talking to you. - I know, brother. I know you're hurt. Think you're trying to help... Don't you tell me what I'm thinking. You know, if this happened to your family, there'd be six charters halfway to Oakland. - This did happen in my family. - No, it didn't! The Niners came gunning for my son. They killed my daughter-in-law. You got that, huh? You got that kind of hole in your family? I got it. Where you going? Nobody wants to even this out more than me. Let's just bury Donna, catch our breath. And then we'll do what needs to be done. Let's do that. Keep an eye on the old man. Where's he going? I don't know. That's why you're following him. Right. Excuse me. Can I have a minute? Yeah, sure. I heard about what happened to Donna. God, I'm so sorry. Thanks. Anybody know what happened? I know you're busy. I just wanted to make sure you were all right. I appreciate that. I'm sorry about last night. I... It's okay. It's not okay. Nothing is okay. Like the last few weeks, I... I tried to follow your lead, you know, find some kind of... compartment to put all this stuff in, but I just... I can't. I don't... sleep. I'm more scared now than I ever was. I'm scared of getting caught, I'm scared of not getting caught. We got away with murder. What does that make me? A survivor. I think you're a good man, with a big heart. I believe you try and do as much good as you can, but... You live a life I don't think I'll ever really understand. I called Chicago Presbyterian today, and they said they'd take me back. And I think it's the best choice. Don't you get tired of it? Running? I'm not running. I'm just being realistic, Jax. Call it whatever you want. Your life is a series of hit and runs. The minute someone makes you feel uncomfortable, tests your loyalty, little Tara packs her bags and hits the road. I guess you got what you wanted from me, right? Used me to do your dirty work. - That's not fair. - Not fair? You want to know how many women I've slept with over the last ten years? - Don't do this. - Hundreds. Maybe more. I don't know. I barely see their faces. I married Wendy because I was lonely. Because I got tired of the endless disconnect. It was just a sad time-out. Because when I'm inside someone, there's only one face I see. When you came home, it was like some kind of sign to me. Like my past coming round, giving me another shot to do this different... better. Now that chance is running back to Chicago. You take care, Doc. You think I could borrow your car? I need more wipes. My wallet's over there. Just take what you need. That Jax's stuff? I figure I'd better unpack for him, or the shit will be sitting in the garage for the next three months. You're like... Dr. Jekyll and Donna Reed. So you and Jax, how's that coming? He has his doubts about me coming back. We all do. I'm gonna convince him. I'm gonna be the girl he fell in love with. Good for you. Thanks. All right, I'll be back. Some shit never changes. What's going on? I wanted to give you this news in person. - That don't sound good. - It's not. The U.S. Attorney is releasing the details on the witness at 5:00. At 5:01, ATF is presenting their case against Opie Winston for Hefner's murder. Bring him in for a lineup. From what the prosecution's shared, he's probably not going back home. - Jesus Christ. - So what do we know? It's an eyewitness. Probably a resident. They offered wit pro. That means he's in lockdown. Opie buries his wife tomorrow. I'll drag my feet. See that they don't bring him in too early. Sorry. Have my office call you about my retainer? Sure. Thanks. G, Dog, go. Their whole case against Bobby and Opie is that witness. - Without him, they got nothing. - So we got to get to him. - Kill him? - He's a rat. Rats deserve to die. End of story. Wit pro means safe house. 24-hour protection. - That's a dead end. - That can't be. Opie goes back to prison, what happens to his kids? What, the state's gonna give them to Piney or Mary? - They're gonna end up in the system. - And let's not forget Bobby. He got I.D.'d because he had to clean up after Ope's mistake. We got to do this before the funeral. Ope's family can't take another hit. - Agreed. - Right. Maybe Trammel can help. If the safe house is in San Joaquin, it's probably got sheriffs on it. Call Happy. I'm sure one of his smiley face tats is for a dead witness. I'm on it. I got like a serious problem here. I followed Piney into Oakland. What is he doing Oakland? It looks like he's going into a bar. But there are Niner tags everywhere. Piney went looking for Laroy. - Oh, goddamn it! - Crazy old coot. - Where are you? - 38th and Allendale. Watch his back. We're on our way. - Let's go get him. - Just get him out of there. Deal with the Niners later. - Let's go find Trammel. - Right. Glad you could join me. I was just, you know, coming down to... see what you were doing and stuff. You need to... brush up on your stealth skills. You did everything but wave at me while you were following. I did wave at you actually. I was getting a little lost coming off the 580 there. I was hoping you'd slow down. If you're coming, let's go get this party started. Okay, you know, I was thinking we could not do that and just hang out here for a bit. I don't need those guys. I know what I gotta do. Shit. If you're looking for the assisted living home, it's two blocks south. No, sweetheart. I got all the assistance I need. Sista. Cracka. What kind of shit is this? What business you got here? Just looking for a friend. You ain't got no friends here. Where's Laroy? Want to get yourself killed, old man? Well, I'm ready for that. Are you? Yeah, the feds put us on some safe houses. You know, depends on the case. - What's this about? - I need to locate someone. See how committed they are to what they saw. Jesus Christ, Clay. You want me to hand over a federal witness? No, we just want to talk to him, Trammel. How goddamned stupid do I look? Man, I don't care how thick the envelope is. - All right, no. - You don't understand. I ain't offering you money. When this witness fingers Opie and Bobby, ATF comes after us with RICO. - Shit. - Yeah, man. That means all of us, and everybody attached to us goes down. You do savvy that, my not stupid friend? Jesus Christ. We'll have the name of the witness this afternoon. They're not going to use a name. You're going to need a case number. A case number? Where the hell are we supposed to find that intel? The top of Charming's food chain. We got a problem. Go in, safety's off, Shit. Crazy, old man. This doesn't involve you, Jax. These assholes killed Donna, and I'm gonna make that right. What the hell is he talking about? I get him to put down the revolver, you promise we walk out of here alive? Yeah. Put down the gun, Piney. I ain't leaving till the nigger that killed Donna is dead. All right?! Shithead. Easy. Noise we made at the Mayan gun sale is about how pissed off we are. But if we wanted your cracker asses dead... Someone last night in a gansta SUV gunned down my daughter. Now, that smells just like nigger revenge to me. Nigger... Old, fat bastard here says "nigger" one more time, and that walking out alive deal we talked about? Off the Goddamn table. Someone went after one of my guys. Killed his wife by mistake. It wasn't us. So this "old, fat bastard" is supposed to take your word for it, because you're an honorable, and black man and all? Shut up! Your trouble with us, you work that out of your system? - Or does this beef keep growing? - Why do you keep talking about beefs? Let me handle this or I will kill you myself! Our business issues still need to be worked out, but if... my need to hurt Sam Crow took me to Charming, had me killing women, do you think we'd be sitting here talking? I'm telling you the truth. Niners didn't kill your daughter. I suggest you boys find your way back home... quickly. How'd you get in here? I told the guy at the gate we were here to fix your cars. Guess we look like the help. What's this about? This a great-looking horse, man. I assume you got that, special delivery package I sent you? Yeah, I got it. You made your point. I reneged on our deal. That knife. It's still got your prints all over it. The nut-less clown raped your daughter? Well, he's buried in Macon Woods. Dead body, murder weapon, motive... The three things a guy needs for a homicide conviction. Jesus Christ. You're insane. I assure you, Elliot, I'm saner than I've ever been. I need your help, Elliot. And... if you refuse, I'm going to turn all three of those items over to Unser. And the only thing you'll be riding is a big, black dude named Jo. So what do you want? I assume you got friends in the U.S. Attorney's office. Maybe... a couple of judges you play golf with? Where are we at with Donna's murder? Nowhere. No leads? Suspicions? No. Sorry. Come with me. Gives us some privacy. For what? I know how close you and Opie are. I remember you and him in high school. You were inseparable. This is feeling a little gay. I knew Stahl was setting up Opie as a rat. She wired his truck. I think Clay found that wire, thought Opie was working with the Feds, and then tried have him killed. Donna was a mistake. Why are you telling me this shit? You think I'll give up Clay? We ended up on opposing teams. You and me... don't like each other all that much, but seeing an innocent woman gunned down? Two little kids... with no mom. Man, I think that falls on the wrong side of the fence for both of us. You got something you want to say? Donna Winston was murdered last night. - What are you talking about? - She was gunned down. Brutal. Who the hell would want to kill Opie's wife? You see, it was a... It was a mistake. The killer thought that he was killing Opie. Who went after Opie? I made Clay believe that Opie was the witness who fingered you. But it was a lie. I set him up. Why you telling me this? We'll be charging Opie with Hefner's murder. Pick him up after the funeral tomorrow. U.S. Attorney will seek the death penalty for both of you. I guess I'm feeling guilty about creating orphans. Thanks for listening. Beautiful animal. Yeah. Can I tell you something? Well, if it involves you and a horse, I'd rather not hear it. Yesterday... Yesterday at the warehouse, Opie, he... He saved me from getting my head blown off. And then, I had a clear shot at him. And I couldn't take it. You know? And shooting through the back of that window in the truck? I was afraid. I was afraid if I saw his face, I couldn't pull the trigger. I didn't know, Clay, that it was Donna until it was done. I depend on you so much for that shit, sometimes I forget the weight of it. This thing with Op, all that means is, you got love for your brothers. Donna, it was awful shit. Awful. We're going to get past this. Case number. What are you going to do with that information? What'd you tell your Judge buddy? That a councilman wanted the information, because he didn't want safe houses in his district. Good. Very good. What about that knife? It's still our secret. Don't worry, we'll keep it safe for you. I called Happy on the prepay. He had an alarming amount of knowledge about safe houses and witnesses. Of course he did. Said there's usually a sheriff or two outside, an ATF agent inside. Mostly rookies who get stuck baby-sitting. - Thinks it'll take three guys. - All right, me, Chibs, Happy. - You okay to do this? - Yeah. I need to. All right. Give Trammel the case number. Tell him to call us with the location. I want a flawless plan. All right, you take out the witness. - Nobody else gets hurt. - Okay, no mistakes. Where is he? Well, he's not back yet. Why? What's the matter, Jackson? I got some information on Donna. What information? Tell Clay I'm in the chapel. He knows. - What? - Jax knows something about Donna. - He doesn't know shit. - Listen to me. He knows everything. This was in one of his boxes. It's what he found in storage when Abel was born. He wrote it all down. All his pathetic hopes and dreams. This is a book of failures and fixes. John is speaking to him from the goddamn grave. - You're being hysterical. - I told you to nail Jax down. - Bring him closer! - This is a bunch of words. - It's a bunch of shit! - It means everything to my Jax! I know my son. He is restless, just like his old man. Always looking for something more, the reasons why. This shit is going to send him on a destiny run. Reading those secrets, finding out about the Donna mistake... What happened to John. I cannot do that again. - Not with him. - Now you listen to me. What he read there, were the ramblings of a bitter, grieving coward. Look at it, it's half-way burned. Probably pissed him off. So don't tell me he's poisoned! And this shit with Donna, there's nothing to know. So you'd better calm down. This is about your fear, your history. You stop bleeding all over him. And finish burning that. You are losing control. Just like he did. You're looking for me? Two days ago, you sat there. You made me a promise. Told me Opie was safe. Now I'm asking you, brother to brother, father to son, to tell me the truth and I'll accept it. Whatever it is. Just be honest with me. Did you try to kill Opie, kill Donna by mistake? I don't know who's been filling your head with this shit, son. I'm-a tell you again. I love Opie, loved Donna. I'd never do nothing to hurt them. It's a rough time for Sam Crow. But we'd better put this shit behind us. Suspicion, resentment... that kind of shit eats up morale, fractures a charter. Yeah. That's true. You know where Tig is? Yeah. He's on his way to the safe house. What's the matter? The info on that witness just came out. She's a 17-year-old girl, Jax. Holy shit. Where are they? What are you doing? Where the hell you going? Shit. Let's do this. Go. Westly? - Sheriff Lane, you copy? - Go. Shit. Drop it, bitch. Give me that gun. Step up. Take her. Jesus Christ! You've got to be shitting me. Our witness. A house call. *** I was on my way home from work, just thought I'd stop by and check in. I guess I miss him, you know? Yeah, I do. How is he? I can do this, bro. No, it's me. Sorry. I'm really sorry, kid. Jesus! You scared the shit out of me, man. - Put down the gun. - What? We don't kill women. What are you doing here, brother? - What the hell is this? - Put it down, or I will put a bullet in your temple. You think you got the balls to do that? All right. - You two, get out of here. - This wasn't the plan. - You think this through. - Go home, now. Let's go. You see this guy? He's a bad guy, and he wants you dead. You know why? 'Cause you're gonna rat on two of his friends! So you can't do that. 'Cause he will find you no matter where you are. And next time, I won't be there to save your life. You understand? The Feds, the cops... nobody can protect you, that's obvious. If you testify, - you will die. - I won't, I promise. You get a train, you get a bus, you steal a goddamn car... I don't give a shit. You get out of California tonight, or you're dead! You just crossed the line, brother. You know? Not yet. - Come on. - Bring it. Come on. To my oldest, dearest and wisest friend. What we started, you and I, was a good thing, for a good reason. What we've become is a different thing, for reasons I no longer understand. I feel angry winds at my back, and I'm not sure how much time I have left in this cut I love so much. This book is for all the things we wanted, and for all the things we still can be. I love you, brother. J.T. Go catch up with your grandma. Thanks. You're welcome. - Here. - Keep it. Thanks. It's cool water down there. Time for a change.
