Otto... now Chibs. This guy's trying to break us. This is a hostile work environment claim filed against me and my proxy by Margaret Murphy. You threatened her. I had a passionate conversation with her. This is my livelihood! The club is the club, my life is my life. Stay out of it! We need guns. Our distributor is temporarily offline... INS. He's having a little trouble getting into the country. We know you deal AK's. We'll pay double. All you can get us. Why don't you tell me how I get right with you trying to kill a brother behind the club's back? Your little trigger boy blowing an innocent woman's head off. If you mention Donna or the incident again, I'll kill ya. - Your new porn studio. - Sam Crow as a partner? - All of a sudden you're Larry Flynt? - We offer her protection, a space, front her a little cash for the shit the feds took, - split the profits. - You're one of Luann's girls. Opie. She's been helping me out. - You serious about it? - The kids like her. Otto said some guy's giving you trouble. Shitbag's threatening my girls if they don't join his company. Saw some wood splinters. Probably a bat. Sorry to interrupt. We just found Luann Delaney off County 18 - beaten to death. - Did you cause this? - The hell are you talking about? - Payback? Caracara? I'm not the one murdering women! You okay? Something that brutal... had to be... payback or... a message. We don't know. It could have been the scumbag producer. We roughed up Caruso a couple times. When? Yesterday. You should go, Jax. I'm sorry, man. All right, thanks, man. - Rosen. - Where's he at with the charges? The quality of the security video is shit. He's gonna push to have it tossed, and most of the families at the Christian Center don't want to get involved. That should slow down the DA. Gentlemen. So, I couldn't come through on your guns. ATF's got eyes on my supplier. Not what I wanted to hear. I'm hoping to make it up to you. You mentioned that your gun source has INS issues? Maybe we can help. It's no secret you're losing your slice of the H pie. You need guns to guard your corners, I need a new pipeline. Work together. Got my guy detained in Oakland. New level of security. Customs flagged his passport and visa as bogus. He's claiming it's a technical error. - And if INS starts digging? - They find the truth. Mahmoud Sakairi: ex-PLO. Gun feed heads straight back to Hamas. Hearing's tomorrow morning. And your crew couldn't persuade the judge? Too risky. My guys show up, the judge doesn't spook, they'll start digging into Mahmoud's Asian contacts. But a bunch of white guys twist the judge's arm... You all look the same. We do this, you make sure Mahmoud opens up his pipeline to the Sons. We'll both be in your debt. Room 208. Have a good time. Son of a bitch. Let's get out of here. Shit! Date's over, kids. Come on. Get your clothes on. Five girls, four johns. Couple of 'em in possession. Crank. Pussy and a bump. - Has to be Darby. - Excuse me, Chief... Skinny blonde says she's gotta talk to you. This is a mistake, okay? We were set up. Call our boss. He'll tell you. You willing to give up Darby? We don't work for that scumbag. Who's your boss? Riding through this world All alone God takes your soul You're on your own The crow flies straight A perfect line On the devil's bed Until you die Gotta look this life In the eye. Episode 209: Fa Guan Get in here. Made banana bread. Want a piece? Still warm. Shut the door. Unser picked up two of your cum divas in a low-rent hooker sting. I knew getting into porn was a bad call. I want us out. Losing Luann was awful, but we have other directors. Caracara is in full swing. It's a solid moneymaker. It's dirty and I'm done with it. Liquidate. You sell off whatever you can. Porn is Jax's deal. - We all voted yes. - Close it down! I'll handle the little prince. - What do we got? - The INS judge is small-time, man. Close to retirement. He lives alone, cushy little suburb just outside of Oakland. Widower, one kid. Son at Berkeley. That's our emotional leverage. Kid... is local, he's exposed. We threaten that. I told Lin we're gonna have to see the guns we're risking our ass for, so I arranged to have a little hardware test. That's you. What? - Who's gonna press the judge? - Bobby and Ope. And you take Happy with you. He'll know how to persuade. This is bullshit. Give us a minute. What the hell is this, "testing hardware"? What am I, a goddamn prospect? This ain't about you. It's about Ope. It's important we bring him closer. The deeper in he gets, the more we're protected. Yeah, and the more you hurt Jax. I don't give a shit about Jax. How did Otto take it? Same way any of us would. - Do we know her? - Not yet. Georgie and his crew left for Thailand this morning. It's a buying trip. Fleeing the scene. That's where my money lands. Luann is not your fault. Take a lap, kid. All right. Fiona was here. - When? - Yesterday. Apparently, my kid got wind of the accident. Fi came to make sure I was okay. Jimmy O with her? I didn't see him, but he'd never let her travel on her own, so he must be here. When we were inside, Stahl had photos of Zobelle with Cameron trying to get us to sell out the IRA. Cameron's selling to Zobelle? Confirmed it yesterday. We lost the Irish pipeline. Jimmy'll be going mad. It wasn't our choice, man. It doesn't matter. He'll still find a way of blaming me. Just checking up. Chief Unser's looking for you. We'll handle it. You just get better. You okay? I talked to Dr. Gallagher. We're taking you off the critical list. You should be able to go home in about a week or so. That's good news. I appreciate you looking after me, Tara. - You're a good girl. - You're welcome. You do know your insurance has lapsed? Yeah, my last birthday, seems that I aged into the unaffordable bracket. You're gonna have to finish your recuperation at Stockton Memorial. Come on, Doc. Give me a few more days. There's nothing I can do. It's out of my hands. It's hospital policy. I'll do the rest of my mending at home. - Stockton has a good cranial expert... - I don't give a shit about my head. Do you think I'm gonna be lying on my goddamn back somewhere unprotected? Ran a sting this morning, prostitution. Logger Point Motel. Hookers in Charming? Hookers and movie stars. Two of them were your Caracara girls. Want to talk to their boss. Perfect. You okay? Anything on Luann? Crime scene is clean. Right now, we got nothing. Can you give me a few minutes? You need anything? Honey, I'm fine. I'm fine. All right. Catch up with you at the station. Wanted to make sure this Luann thing doesn't get you... overreacting. You think it was Zobelle? Do you? Zobelle didn't kill me. He's not gonna risk murder on someone like Luann. Doesn't cut deep enough. That makes sense. You okay? I keep forgetting to take that stupid pill that helps my equilibrium. Della's helping you monitor the meds, yeah? She went to... be with her mother for a while. Been three months. You been going through this shit all alone? I'm a prick, Gemma. Treatments make me miserable. It's the best thing for now. If you need anything... just let me know. Folks in my support group been going to this revival service. Was gonna check it out. Use a ride tomorrow morning. I'll clear my calendar. You know, this thing with Luann... Maybe you should take a few days off. We're all logging extra time on the sex cams, trying to help Jax. I'm just saying. If you want to take some downtime, I'd help you out. I'm not looking to be taken care of, Op. This is what I do. I know. Better be getting back. - Will I see you later? - It's gonna be a pretty late one. Bobby's sister's watching the kids. I don't mind watching them. I'll bring Piper by, rent a movie or something. That's okay. Can't keep doing this to you. I like going to your place. Feels like a home. See you in the morning. Is that okay? Keep an eye on Lyla. Anything happens, give us a call. I accept that. Come on, Legs, you got a visitor. - What the hell were you thinking? - Got a phone call, wouldn't give his name. Offered us ten grand to help out Darby. What do you mean "help out"? He wanted his johns thinking they had some high-end pussy. Two days of work, that was the deal. - And day one, the cops show up. - It had to be Georgie. Psycho killed Luann, got us busted. - When did you get the call? - Day before yesterday. That's before we hassled Georgie. Setup's not on him. Then who is it? I don't know. Aren't you gonna bail us out? Let me just get an advance on my trust fund. Your tip panned out. To be honest, I'm surprised you acted on it. Where else is Darby dealing crank and pussy? I'm not quite certain you and I are on the same page yet, David. I thought by now we'd be working together. That security footage of me and Darby is bullshit. It's nothing. Nothing criminal. But I think it would raise enough eyebrows on city council to throw your appointment as chief into question. Darby's got a cooker in an old motor home... scrap metal yard off Manion. Also, another low-rent brothel at the Red Oak Suites. That's all of it. This is your last chance. Do your job. How'd it go with the Chinese? What? Clay heard what happened to the girls. That and Luann. He wants me to kill Caracara. It's club action; he can't shut it down. He don't give a shit. Someone paid our girls to be on Darby's roster today, wanted them to get busted. You think Clay needed an excuse to shut me down? I'm not sure I know what either one of you would do anymore. We need Caracara. It's our only club income. Gun biz is back online. New 20, new source. We're done with pussy. Just for a minute, try to think past this bullshit between you and me. Porn is a legitimate business, Clay. So is auto repair. And that don't make my skin crawl. Look at your run with guns over the last few years. We've lost more than we've earned. Money and blood. - That's gonna change. - With the Chinese? We don't even know if this pipeline is real or where the guns are coming from. Jesus Christ. That's where you're putting the future of our club. Sam Crow deals guns. You had your little romp as porn king. You tied us to prostitution, you got one of our member's old lady killed. You are really gonna stand there and lay the guilt of a dead wife on me? You remember that promise I made. Let me make it easy for you. You need a majority vote to shut down Caracara. We put it out at church tomorrow night. Want to tell me what that dead wife shit was about? Otto knew, man. I got Luann killed. You thought you were doing the right thing. I was tapping Luann. You serious? Ever since I took over her books. How was that? A little scary. You're covered, I guess. Prison clause. I know, but it still feels shitty. Sorry, man. We move on, right? Clay... he's not gonna get a majority vote. The guys, they love porn. They practically live at the studio. That's why he hates it. Cum equals cash, brother. We all know it. Caracara ain't going nowhere. We got to talk, - you and me, alone. - I'm done with alone. Anything you got to say, Bobby can hear. It's about Opie. Clay's got him on point, working this judge. Nothing I can do. If this thing goes bad and Opie has to go down that road, there's no way he's coming back. You're worried about losing your right-hand seat. We both know why shit's upside down. Keep Ope light. I'll show up after I check those guns and work this judge. The way me and Ope are going, I try and talk him down, it may be the very thing that pushes him to it. Maybe you should tag along anyhow. I'll meet you at that judge's house. Zobelle is putting down roots. He's backing my brother for mayor, and he wants me on his team once I'm chief. Why are you telling me this? Aren't the Hale's on board for the bright new day? I know the greater devil when I see it. Zobelle is flooding this town with Darby's crank and pussy. And he wants me to shut it down to prove to Charming they don't need the Sons. You have till the end of the day to be heroes. You had to swallow a lot to hand this over. It's not about humility. My biggest priority will be shutting you down. But I'm gonna do it the right way. Where's Hap? I'm taking Clay's lead. Getting back into guns. Clay's cool with it. Why aren't you with Bobby and Ope? Jax said he was handling it. Call your Nomads. We need bodies. We've been deputized. Come on. You get that door right there. - Too much brown sugar. - Pack up the hams, baby. Wanted to say I was sorry. I shouldn't have interfered with things around here. I told Chibs I was transferring him to Stockton Memorial... he freaked out, panicked. Said he would be unprotected. Someone just blew him up. He's a little twitchy. But... you do what you got to do, and we'll figure out a way to keep him safe. From what? Jesus, when does this settle? When does it stop? I don't know, baby. Shit! You white boys never learn. You and PD keep whacking the mole... - we keep popping up someplace else. - Whacking days are done. Zobelle sold you out. No more money, no more Aryan muscle. I smell the stink of your crank or your pussy anywhere near Charming, I'll put three bullets in your neck... compliments of Charming PD. Light it up. Shit. Move. Judge is in the gate. Take him down. I'll cover the yard. Don't make a... Shut up! Shut up. Take what you want and get the hell out. There's no money. Just what's in the wallet. We're not here to rob you. We need your help with a problem. What problem? Got it. Easy, junior. Get in there. You son of a bitch. Is this you, Alex? Are you the problem? What, he owe you drug money? What the hell you talking about? You low-life, junkie piece of shit. Your mother would be disgusted. - Stay down - Jesus Christ. So much for our emotional leverage. I don't care how pissed off he is, hewon't let us hurt his kid, junkie or not. We stick to the plan. Mahmoud Sakairi. He's got a deportation hearing tomorrow morning. It's a simple misunderstanding. Dismiss it, everyone walks away from this whole. This is about throwing out a case? 23 years on the bench, I've never been swayed by anyone or anything. I'm not going to start now. Let me be clear. You throw out the case or I cut your family in half. You won't. I'll beat him, I'll break off his fingers and then I'll kill him. Jesus Christ, just give him what he wants. - Dad, they're going to kill me. - He is not going to kill you. - Get off of me. - You cannot - just blow holes in this kid. - I barely winged his toe. The old man is going to break. I don't give a shit how bad the blood is. No father is going to let his son die in front of him. Get out of my way. The toe stung. The knee... it's going to make him want to kill himself. If you're going to kill him, just do it. I'm not going to give you what you want. So torturing him is just a waste of time. You might as well shoot him. This what you want? This how you protect your family? Dad! You're going to let me kill your kid, huh? That's how you protect your blood? Open your eyes, you piece of shit! Open your eyes! You see it! You look at what you've done! You see what you've caused! Look at what you've done to your family! Open your mouth! It's done. Shit. Your turn. I can't, I can't do...*** Shit, guys. Go look for something. Anything that'll help. Go, go. Relax. I'm all right. I know. What happened? Severe head pain. He can't see out of his right eye. Dr. Gallagher ordered an MRI. Thanks, Doc. - He should be put back on critical. - Dr. Gallagher already did. You bankroll me, back me with muscle, and then you yank it out from under me? Navigating around law enforcement is a game of give and take. It wasn't PD. It was Clay. He told me you sold me out and seeing as how all three of my interests have been crushed today, I tend to believe him. Do you want recompense against Sam Crow? It means "payback. " I know what it means, asshole. I want to hurt 'em. I'm going to hit outside. Storage shed. They'll see the flames from the highway. Alarms are cut. Keep it contained to the inside. This thing will cook all night before the flames are visible. Let's go. What do you think? You think I got a future in this business. That should do it. - What the hell?! - Your need had a short lifespan. We got something. Please, no. You can't. Please. Throw out the case. Love letters. Found a room upstairs. God damn shrine to his dead wife. You don't throw out the case tomorrow morning, or you tell anyone about us, we trash wifely's room. Burn every memory you have. Okay. We made it work. Then we waited at the house for the call. It's done. The judge dismissed the case. It's all good. I checked out Lin's guns. MP-5s- really good hardware, man. Where they going? Home. How long you gonna be? Aren't you coming in? No, I can't. I got some errands to run. About an hour. I'll call you. I know you? Everyone knows me. Good morning. That was Hale. He just tried you on the cell. What? Unbelievable. This was Clay. Couldn't let me have it. Talk to Quinn. Tell him I want to transfer.
