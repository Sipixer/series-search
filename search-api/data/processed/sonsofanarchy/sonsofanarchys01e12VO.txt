Your mom says that I have to end this. I want you to stop listening to my crazy mom. - Someone's here to see you. - You left rehab? No. I'm moving into a sober living house. You want to stay until you check in? - You want this family back together? - It's the only thing I want. I will do whatever I can to help make that happen. Cameron was supposed to kill that piece of shit Hefner. I want Ope pulling the trigger on this. No mistakes. Shit. Robert Munson, you're under arrest for the murder of Brenan Hefner. ATF says they got an eyewitness. Only two other guys were witness to that hit. - Where's Ope? - He checked Opie's finances. Somebody paid off a huge chunk of his debt. Federal wire transfer. I figured the least I could do was pay off some of those big bills of yours. - You're setting me up as the rat. - What is going to happen when I put you and your family back in Charming? I tell the club the truth. I know how this looks. She set me up to look like a rat. It's all a lie. I don't know who the hell the witness is, but sure shit ain't me. - Am I good with you, Clay? - Yeah. His truck was wired. Opie has turned on us. This has got to happen, Clay. This death never lands at our feet. I love you. Sometimes I think you love that bird more than me. Sometimes I do. Get out of here. Go on. Beat it. Told you not to do that shit here. Get out of here! Go on! - Get out! - Crazy old shithead! It's your lucky day, little boy. You get to join your family. Episode 112: The Sleep of Babies The meeting's all set. Oakland, 2:30. Good. If Opie's wired, there's no way in hell we're gonna be able to separate him from everybody, everything we're doing. We gotta protect our guys. It's gotta happen today. Okay. The tracker on Opie's pickup is working, but we're not getting anything from the bug or the cell. Check his truck when you can. He might've been smart enough to sweep it. What if Clay or one of the others found it? The pretrial for Hefner's murder starts tomorrow. US Attorney'll have to release the name of the witness. So, Sam Crow will know that Opie isn't the snitch, and we can start making our case tying him to Hefner's killing. Just have to keep him safe for another 24 - and then we can arrest his shaggy ass. - I know she's here. I want to see her! Clay Morrow wants to see you. It's okay. You kick down my doors. You hurt my wife... You lock up one of my brothers for a crime he didn't commit. We'll let a jury of his peers decide that. What you did to Opie and his family proves one thing. You're desperate. 'Cause you got nothing on us. It kills you, doesn't it? To see me and my guys living good lives. Families, friends, nice homes. You hate the fact that we get the same rights and freedoms as you do. Gee. You make me so proud to be an American. You're a fascist pig, and what Otto did to you is just the tip of the iceberg. We're good. Our retainer with Rosen's good for one more week, but if this thing with Bobby goes to trial, we're gonna have to pony up some serious up-front cash. We have every dime in the warehouse rebuild. I know. I talked to Alvarez. The Mayans want guns. They want them right away. We ain't got nothing to sell. Irish don't start shipping till next month. We pull our security surplus. We sell 'em those. Wait a minute. I thought we didn't sell that surplus. We don't. We sell 'em those guns. It's a goodwill gesture. Mayans turn around, place a big order. They give us half the cash in advance. Leaves us nothing to protect the club. I'm out of ideas here, Jax. If we don't jump on this deal, we lose it. I'm just trying to help Bobby here. I get that, but ATF are still camped out in Unser's office. - You really want to take that risk? - We can do this smart. We set up two locations in Oakland, right? We pick up the money from one, we drop off the guns at the other. This way even if the feds are watching us, they never see money for guns. Why would the feds still be trailing us? Maybe they're pissed off 'cause you didn't turn. You and Tig pick up the money. Me and Jax drop off the guns. I'll go with Ope and Tig. Fewer the better. Why don't you just... go up to the warehouse, let me know how that's going. Some bullshit errand. I got stuff to do. I think that's all of them. It's just some liability stuff. Is something wrong? With Abel leaving, I just... realize it's not just you. You have a son. We need to think about what we're doing. Man, you really want to talk about this, huh? Was the one upside of Wendy: she was usually too wasted for relationship chats. I'm painfully sober. I can see that. I'm not getting out of this, am I? That shit was crazy, Tara. That "I gotta be with you every minute or I'm gonna kill myself" type of crazy. I know. Look, the way I feel about you, it hasn't changed. I could still go there. But this can't be that. So we gotta figure out what's right. But I'm not trying to avoid this. What we have. It's just gonna, you know, take a minute to know what to do. You can have a minute. Where you been? Here, take the other end. I know what you're doing. Hanging a banner? With me and Tara. And what am I doing? Using me... to hurt her and Jax. Asking me if I still love him, do I want my family together? That was all about pushing her out of the picture. Doesn't change anything. Still meant everything I said. What do you care what my motives are? You still get the thing you want the most... and so do I. I was okay with you slipping me enough crank to kill a horse. Because of what I did to Abel, I deserved that, but I am not the same person I was two months ago. I can't be a part of this. You're playing with people's lives, Gemma. I'm protecting the innocent. If I step on a few toes in the meanwhile, so be it. Jesus, you really believe that, don't you? So, what? Putting down that needle for a few weeks somehow gives you the right to judge me? You better take a good, long look, sweetheart, 'cause you are burning a hole through the very thing you can't wait to become. Maybe that's why you hate yourself so much. Sooner you accept that, sooner you put down this holy crutch. Jesus... is just a guy who cuts my lawn. If you need anything, I just want you to ask Agent Yost, - who will be staying with you. Okay? - When does the trial begin? We don't know exactly, but soon. - Is it going to take a long time? - I'm not sure. Look, don't worry, okay? We have sheriffs on the street. I have my people staying with you. It'll all be over before you know it, all right? Come on. You think this a bad idea. Yeah, I do. Clay made the deal with the Mayans to make sure the war didn't reach Charming. It's bigger than that, man. What? Let's just get this done. Hang on. If you think I'm walking into something... Look at the last few months, man. Our warehouse gets blown up. Mayans try to kill Clay. Bobby's in jail. We got ATF trying to stick RICO up our ass. How much longer you think this club's got? We're better than this, man. My old man. He saw the nightmare coming. He was smart, Ope, way smarter than me. He had ideas about where to take the club. You know? Legitimate ways to earn. He knew that Sam Crow has got to change to survive. Clay'll never walk away from running guns. I know. He's made that very clear. A few more years... He won't be able to turn the throttle, and you'll be #1. And Bobby and Tig? Pushing them in a new direction? Jesus Christ. Two immovable objects. Irresistible force. It could happen. - Donna's here. - Thanks. Probably best not to greet her with two bags of guns. - I'm sorry to bother you. - No, it's all right. What's up, baby? Your mom wants to take the kids to Funtown and then to dinner. I didn't want to say yes until I talked to you. Mom's volunteering to spend time with the kids? I guess she had a good time with them. You really should talk to her, Ope. I think she's just finding excuses to stay around until she sees you. Maybe. She can take the kids. It means we'll have the house to ourselves for a while. Shit. Jax is having a party for Abel. It's a homecoming thing. You don't have to go, but I got to swing by and drop off a gift. I want to go. Abel coming home is a big deal. Our family should be there. We should. I'd like that. I'll tell Mary to bring the kids home before dinner. BAILOUT MY KIDS WE NEED FOOD - You really doing this for your kids? - Yes, ma'am. Got two boys. Uncle Sam cut off my aid. Again. You look pretty able-bodied to me. There's got to be something better you can be doing than holding up clever signs and begging. Hard for me to hold down a job, ma'am. Account of the mental illness. Tend to fly into rages, no apparent reason. Since when is that a mental illness? Don't shoot this into your arm. That's kind and generous. Thank you, ma'am. Abel will help my little boys. What? Able to help my little boys. Bless you. Glad you're still in one piece. Been a real exciting month. Should I be worried about eyes on us? Nobody knows I'm here. Including my own crew. Shit looks serious, man. - What's giving you worry? - It was Alvarez that tried to off me. I need to buy some time, prevent the war from hitting Charming. Told him I'd sell him some guns. - You're selling to the Mayans? - That's why you and me are talking. There's a meet arranged for this afternoon. Alvarez thinks he'll be getting his first gun shipment. He ain't. Time and locations of the deal. Guns at one, money at the other. I want you and your crew to step on both ends. I put a bullet in Alvarez, you drop as many wetbacks as you can. And why in the good Lord's name would I be doing your dirty work? You keep the guns, I keep the money, and, this FUBAR helps move our relationship back to monogamous. I know you've been buying guns from the Russians. Three times the markup, half the selection. If you want to waste your hard-earned heroin money on that shit, you be my guest. I'll feed the competition with the better bullet. What are the weapons? AKs, MAC-10s, combat shotguns. About $25K worth of hardware. All right. We'll make the deal, and then you wait till me and my crew are safe and clear. Then join the party. Hey, look, I understand the need to make an executive decision for the good of the club. I get it. The Opie thing makes sense to me, but this... We have made a club-wide peace with the Mayans... The peace stays intact. The Mayans are going to think that the Niners got their intel off the street, stepped on the deal. Then, all we got to do is spin the angry black man story. - Play the niggers against the wetbacks. - I like it. How do we handle our other problem? Just before the Niners jump in, put a bullet in the back of Opie's head. This way, even if ATF crashes the party, there's no illegal guns and Opie looks like the victim of gangland violence. And we blame the angry black man. It's the American way. Donna took the truck to get groceries. I checked it. Bug's been ripped out. And Opie's cell is dead. Clay found it. Thinks Opie's working for us. That's what this morning was. He's feeling guilty about what he might have to do. - How do we handle this? - Put an extra team on him. - We have to keep Opie in one piece. - I'm on it. - I'll meet you back there. - Okay. Take care. - You looking for me? - Yeah. I need to ask you a question. Okay. Are you with Jax? - I don't how to answer that. - Do you love him? I'm not comfortable having this conversation with you. I don't give a shit what you're comfortable with. We've spoken over a half a dozen times in the past couple of days. You don't think you might have mentioned that you're sleeping with my husband? Ex-husband. Two more months before that's official, okay? He's my husband, and Abel is our son. You need to check into your sober-living facility, get some time. If you and Jax are supposed to be together, he'll be there when you get out. And where will you be? I have to get back to work. She'll never let you be with him. Gemma hates you. She'll do whatever she can to keep you guys apart. May as well quit while you're still ahead. Or alive, for that matter. Let me borrow your cell. I got to check in with Donna. Thanks. Found mine in a pitcher of beer. - You know anything about that? - Maybe it was thirsty. You ever see your kids? Once or twice a year. That hard for you? Used to be. Two girls, right? Dawn and Fawn. Yeah, I know. It's voicemail. Thanks. You're early. You ain't early. You're late. What? I hate dolls, man. - They creep me out. - Back here. That's a story that needs to be told. You go. That's 30 for these. 30 upfront for the order next month. M4s. Full auto. Custom scopes. We know. David, call him. Tell him to give him the cash. Niners God damn it, Laroy. Shit. Shit. Thanks, man. Let's go! What the hell happened here? Gun! Clay! Lay some down! Get in! Was this a mistake or was Laroy sending a message? I don't know. This could be worst case scenario. Niners want us dead. Mayans won't trust us. We'll lose our customer base, gain two huge beefs. Broke with no guns. Shit. It's Gemma. I'm on my way. - Can you pick up Wendy? - Yeah. I'll be there in a few. All right, baby. I got to go pick up my kid. Well, we need something good right now. Go get him. All right. I'll see you at the house. What the hell was that, man? Looks like the angry black man was even angrier than we thought. Laroy definitely double-crossed us. And Ope. No, I couldn't. Couldn't get a clear shot. Well, if... if the Niners are that pissed, maybe... Maybe they bring their rage to Charming. They saw Opie's truck at the money drop. What, a drive-by? Got to be tonight after the party. Make it ghetto. Make it gangsta. All right. I've been looking all over for you. What the hell you doing in here? Only place I can think without the ATF buzzing around. I can relate. I got some information. And if I give it to you, then I'm betraying my badge. And if I don't... ... someone could get hurt. That badge ain't even real silver. What do you need to tell me, son? This might be your most insidious move yet. You have to be more specific. Convincing Wendy she might actually have a shot of winning back Jax and her family? That's a lot of false hope to lay on a recovering addict. I don't know where you're going with this, but I was trying to help Wendy. Encourage her efforts to change. Yes. You are the embodiment of encouragement. Little man. We're busting you out of this place. It's okay. Thanks, Doc. Appreciate it. Let's get this family home. Kids, look at this. Congratulations, Jax. - Look at that. - He's beautiful, Jax. Getting ready for his first brewski? Just you and Grandpa. My boss is pulling the plug on Charming. Why? The Mayan body count in Oakland pissed off the FBI. Gonna have to settle for Munson. Squeeze him for the rest. What about Opie? Opie made his own bed. Yeah, and Clay thinks you're in that bed with him. Okay, this guy's in danger. The witness's identity will be out tomorrow. Sam Crow will know that he is not the snitch. Look, a lot of shit can happen overnight. You cannot pull your detail off him. It's out of my hands. You guys are unbelievable. You storm in here, and you turn this town upside down, and then you just walk away, and you leave us with this mess. We had some fun, though. Right? How you doing, man? Yeah, you're good? Watch this. You think he can keep this up? Wendy, when these kids get older, they lose their nerve. - Watch my hands. - I got to see how you drink this. You doing okay? We're gonna sell this on the road. I'll be right back. Can I talk to you for a second? I need a drink. - What's the matter? - Nothing, it's just... Look, Wendy's like a heartbeat sober. We don't want to do anything to set her off. - Because she's still in love with you? - No. Look, I'm just saying we should be cool with whatever this is around her, you know? Whatever this is? You know what I mean. No, I don't. Do me a favor. Make sure Tara gets home okay. Don't ask. Okay. - What happened? - I got no idea. - Sorry. - Yeah, I can see that. We got to head out. They've had a long day. Thanks for coming. - I'm glad Abel's home. - Me, too. Come on, kids. Let's go. Come on, guys. Okay, kids, seat belts. *** I love you kids, bye. Hey, you coming right home? - Yeah, why? - I want to come back - and help Gemma clean up. - Why don't you just stay? I can take the kids home and put them in bed. - You sure? - Yeah. - Thanks, baby. - You welcome. You got some cash? Gemma needs powder for the dishwasher. Love you. Love you back - Good night, babies. - Good night, Mommy. What's going on? Sorry to bother you on this occasion, but I got some information that probably shouldn't wait. Hey, listen, if it's about that Niner-Mayan shooting in Oakland... No, it's about Opie. What about him? I know ATF's been hanging him out as a rat, but that ain't the case. He's not working for them. The wire's on him, but not to his knowledge. The witness is somebody that lived in the building where Hefner got killed. That's who fingered Bobby Elvis. - How do you know this? - Hale. He's been privy to all of it. I just thought you should know that, in case you were having doubts about loyalty and such. Yeah, I appreciate that. Tell Jax I'm glad his boy's come home. Come on. You all right, baby? What is it? Shit. Donna? It's all right, sir, I let them in. Baby. What do we know? Guy walking his dog saw a black SUV roll up on the truck. Shot her through the back window. - Did they see the guy? Was he black? - They couldn't say. Jesus. Unless Donna's been living some kind of double life, I'm thinking this brutality was meant for Opie. Some scumbag made a tragic mistake. Yeah, I guess that's a pretty fair guess. Come on. Come on, this isn't the way to remember her. I told you this shit would go bad. This blood's on you. Back off, Hale. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, baby. How's Opie doing? You should go home, Mom. What about the baby? I can take care of my son. You sure?
