- All right. White boy was right. M-4s. Niners had a special order. Full auto, laser scopes. Niggers still couldn't hit shit. Load the M-4s and Glocks in the truck, huh? What about the other guns and shit? Torch it. Hey, Louise. You know, you can buy these by the case. Be a lot cheaper. No. A box at a time keeps me humble. Get a pack of smokes, too, darling. It was my favorite. What the hell is that? Oh, shit! What the hell happened? Propane tanks caught fire. Ammo was in there. The place just blew. Shit! The fire dick says it was arson. Saw a lot of boot prints. - Cowboy boots? - Yeah. I think so. Shit-eating Mayans, man. - Where the hell was Rodrigo? - No sign of your watchman. What's the exposure? Officially? Me and the fire department. The fire captain can be convinced to rethink his report. Unofficially? Unofficially, this blast was seen in two counties. This location is dead. Jesus Christ. - The M-4s? - Gone. As are most of the Glocks. Get the fireman on board. Don't want this shit hitting ATF's radar. Let's get out of here. You gotta see something else. Do we really? Goddamn. Fried and refried. Illegals. Part of our assembly crew. Found them before the FD went through. After the smoke clears, get rid of the bodies. What am I supposed to tell our boys up in Oaktown? I'm supposed to deliver five cases to Laroy and his crew before tomorrow{\ morning}. Call the gangsta hotline, set a meeting. Two in the back of the head. Quick and painless. It ain't easy being king. You remember that. 1x01: Pilot {\pos(190,220)}Some days you're the Beamer, {\pos(190,220)}some days you're the goddamn deer. {\pos(190,230)}Some yuppie creamed it out by the streams. {\pos(190,230)}He run into it or hit a tree while it was giving him head? How the hell you you want me to get it out of there? Come on. Jesus, man. Just pretend it's "carve your own steak night" at Sizzler. I don't eat meat, man. Figure it out, grunt. What the hell happened? {\pos(190,230)}Mayans torched the warehouse. {\pos(190,230)}- Stole the Niners' M-4s. - Holy shit. {\pos(190,230)}Clay's gone to sit down with Laroy, {\pos(190,230)}try to buy some time. {\pos(190,230)}Niners already paid for that hardware. {\pos(190,230)}That's the tricky part. Hey, Ma. Did you go to storage? Not yet. {\pos(190,200)}Hope there's something you can use. {\pos(190,200)}Haven't looked through that baby stuff in years. I'm sure anything will help. Still coming to dinner tomorrow night? I'm picking up steaks from the German. Oh, you know it. You should bring Chibs and that new kid. New kid doesn't eat meat. Don't patch him in. Can't trust anyone doesn't eat meat. Hey, you heard from my crazy ex-wife at all? {\a6}Never answers her goddamn phone. {\a6}That's 'cause she knows it's you. She's supposed to be sending me the doctor bills. Haven't seen one in weeks. {\pos(190,220)}I'll go by on my way home. I'll check in on her. Thanks... Grandma. Asshole. {\pos(190,200)}Long ride from Charming to Oakland. How come Easy Rider meeting me face to face? Assembly warehouse burned down. All the guns, including your M-4s, blown to shit. There's zero balance due on that hardware. The shipment - going to be a little late. - That can't happen. Got a shipment of my own coming in. Very important cargo. I been doing business with the One-Niners for a long time. I always respected our arrangement. I never sold "gun one" to the Mexicans. Now I need for you to show me a little respect, and give me a few more days for delivery. Don't give a shit about history or respect. This is about business, old man. And I'm telling you, brother, giving me some more time... really smart business. You got till Sunday. I don't get those M-4s by then, there's going to be some new black faces cruising the streets of Charming. And a burned-down warehouse going to be the least of your problems. "For my sons. "Thomas, who is already at peace. "And Jackson, may he never know this life of chaos."</i> - Just here. - Half-Sack. Piney clogged the toilet again. Jesus Christ. That guy shits more than a grizzly, man. It ain't human. Here, just put it right here under the... Where did you get that name? Half-Sack? Oh, man, I got my left nut blown off by an aper frag in Iraq. - Look at that guy. - Jesus Christ! Put that deformed nut bag away, will you? - Sorry, pal. - Disappear. Go on. Find Jax. Jax...! Hey, Jax! - We're at the table. - Okay. Wendy! Stupid junkie bitch. You got one more day out of Laroy, that's it. Niners are expecting a huge heroin shipment. The carbines are for protection. What happens if those Mayans crash that dope party with the Laroy's M-4s? We lose all the Niner business, buy ourselves a huge black... That ain't gonna happen. These Mexi-assholes come into our territory, they steal from us, they shit on our livelihood. I don't care who we got to grease or kill, I want those goddamned guns back. {\All right,}Me and Chibs will pull together all our current intel on the Mayans. Juice, start hacking into crime databases. Get addresses on any Mayans in the system. Wherever you find those guns, Bobby, I want to Fat Man and Little Boy every inch of that goddamn place. Bobby's got Tahoe this weekend. - No, I'm canceling that shit.{\- No, man} - I should be able to decide... You got two ex-wives who already spent the goddamned casino checks. Last thing we need is PIs and lawyers camping out out front. And whose gonna handle the pyro, I'm not there? Nobody blows up shit better than Opie. - Opie's leaning right these days. - Opie's gonna lean any way we need him to. You get him on board. So you're sure you're okay with me stepping away from this? Yeah, yeah, take the prospect with you. I'll get him half-laid. What is that smell? Oh, shit. - I tried calling you. - What is it? I found these matches next to a bunch of her empty thumb bags. - Hairy Dog. - Shit. Got to be the Nords, dealing out the Dog again. Darby got out of Chino two weeks ago. Well, call that Nazi prick, set a meeting. - What the hell happened? - When was the last time you saw her? Couple of weeks. Her hands and feet were full of tracks. Toxicology reports aren't back yet, but most likely crank. The baby. We had to do an emergency C-section. He's ten weeks premature. Holy shit. Come on, let's sit down and I'll walk you through it. Just tell me. He's got a congenital heart defect and gastroschis... a tear in his abdomen. The gastro and the early birth are from the drugs, but the CHD is probably... - The family flaw. - Yes, it's genetic. Either one would be serious, but not life-threatening. However, the two of them together... Dr. Namid gives him a 20 percent chance, and I'm afraid that's being optimistic. Oh, my God. She never wanted to talk to me. I didn't know. Her OB said she missed her last three appointments. No one knew. Dr. Namid wants to fix his belly first, then, if he stabilizes, he'll go in and try to repair the heart. I'm sorry, Jax. I can take you to see him now. Tara... You don't have to do this. - I'm sure you got other patients. - I asked Dr. Namid if I could assist. I want to help your son. His name's Abel. That's a good name. Jax... - Jackson... - Go with Tara. I got something to do. Watch his back. Sell crank to my pregnant ex-wife. Easy, boys. Hey, brother! I think you made your point. Stupid peckerwood shithead! Enjoy your lunch. Shish-ka-balls are on me. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm gonna go find Ope. So everybody's saying it was a gun factory that blew up out by the streams last night. Mayans hit us. Stole our M-4s. - We need you. - For what? Bobby's got a gig this weekend. - No way, man. - We got to get in and out fast. You're the {\only }guy who can pull it off. You think I want to be here chipping wood for shit pay? I made a promise to Donna. I'm earning straight. Come on, Opie. We all earn straight. I spend 40 hours a week with a goddamn power tool in my hand. When you're on Clay's payroll, everything in your hand is a power tool. You're saying "no" to the club? Everything turned to shit since I got out. I'm in debt up to my eyeballs. My kids hardly know me. I even mention Sam Crow to Donna, she's gonna bust out crying. Look, man, if you need money... I don't want to borrow, I want to earn. Family's just got to adjust to you being around again. Kids got to get used to how ugly their dad is. Donna knows what the life is. You leave a woman alone for five years, two kids, the only thing that she knows is that she doesn't want it to happen again. Break's over, let's go! Let me know when you need me. What's the, uh, Nord's roster looking like these days? 15, 16 guys, a few new kids breaking in. Same extreme hate shit. Still got meth labs outside of Lodi, selling mostly to truckers, some of the Mexi gangs. You think they're stepping up? Only two things feel good in the joint, that's jerking off and thinking about all the shit you're gonna do when you get out. Darby's been in there for three years. I just want to make sure all his big-shot dreams ended up in his cum rag, and not on his to-do list. How's his guy doing? Fractured cheek, broken nose... - left nut swinging solo. - Yes, it was beautiful! Yeah, he's lucky to be breathing. Any luck up north? Tacoma could help with the Glocks, but there's no M-4s anywhere. Washington state, Oregon, Nevada, nobody's got stock, man. We'll have all the Mayan intel by the morning. We'll get our guns back. Oh, yeah, we will. Treasury? All the bills are paid, bar's stocked. Run fund is covered for the next two months. Tig's the only man who owes me dues. I'm a little short. Catch you next week. Guess those little Thai boys are getting expensive. Yeah, they are. How about I slit your eyes and have you suck my dick. All right, all right. - Anything else? - Yeah, I... I just want to say to Jackson, on a club level, the Sons of Anarchy, the Redwood Original, is here for you. Your father'd be proud of the man you've become, you know. Every time I see you sitting at this table, I do a double take. That's probably just the weed, Pop. Probably. I bet it is, yeah. Anyway... whatever you need, son, - it's yours. - Thank you, Piney. Thanks, boys. Meeting closed. - Here you go, Clay. - Thanks, kid. - Bobby? - Yeah? What the hell is that smell? I smell it, too. It's that box. - What is it? - I don't know. Goddamn... - Oh! Geez! - That's mine. You out of your goddamn mind? No, I just... you know, I thought, it was like a surprise. We could mount it in the club, you know, like, on the wall. It's g to stuffed and treated, you idiot. Yeah, I know, I just... Stuffed with what? Did Rosen track down any real estate for the rebuild? Ten acres for sale up north of 84. You know, the stretch industry, paint factories, container yards... Kick his ass! Trucking in supplies will look like regular business. What'd happen if we didn't rebuild? What do you mean? Take the land profit, put it in something else. I'm just thinking about what's best long-term. We got heat with the Mayans. ATF crawling up our ass. Might be time to look at other ways to earn. Yeah, well, there's a lot of shit up in the air right now. We'll figure out what the next move is. Bobby, break that shit up. All right, all right. Stop. You know. Hug it out. You doing okay? Your mom says you haven't been back to the hospital. Don't worry about this Mayan shit. You need to focus on your family. Come on, man, don't push me out of this. I know you're all spun out over Wendy and the kid. Understandable; it's awful shit. But your father and I, we worked hard to create this business. We served time. We lost brothers. We spilled lot of blood. And you're gonna need this now, more than ever. A sick kid, it's an expensive burden. You want to do the right thing by your family. Don't you? Yeah. Of course. Well, then, go see your son. I didn't think you'd want to see me. Everyone hates me. I'm sorry, Jax. I'm so sorry. Please don't hate me. - You need to get help, Wendy. - I know, I know. I will, I promise. This time, I promise. The doctor said Abel's getting stronger. They said maybe they would fix his belly tomorrow, maybe tomorrow morning. They'll do everything they can. My lawyer said they might file criminal charges. Fetal abuse. I got some stuff back at the house in the stash drawer. Jesus Christ. It's just if they find that shit, they're gonna put me away. You own the house, Jax. I hate to see this blow back on you. Yeah. Of course. Jax, wait. Please, please, Jax. Please, Jax. It's almost midnight. This place is a goddamn pig sty. Clean was never her strong suit. - What are you doing here? - It's my house. You know what I mean. I don't want you to see it this way. - Mom, you don't have to do this. - I just want to get it livable. Buy you some decent carpet. - Cigarette burns everywhere. - Mom... Get you outta that dorm room. Back home. - With your son. - Mom, for Christ's sake, stop cleaning! He's not gonna make it. What are you talking about? What happened? He was born with half a stomach and a hole in his heart. He's gonna die. Don't you say that. You are theonlyone this boy's got. You don't believe he's gonna live, you might {\as well }go down there and kill him yourself. I'm sorry. You gotta go see him, Jax. I can't. Why? He'll break your heart. - It's called being a father. - For how long? A day? A week? You know... You were born with that same heart defect your little brother had. You seem pretty sturdy to me. I came through hell. Landed on my feet. Your father was hit by a goddamn semi. Dragged 178 yards. And that bastard lived for two more days. Tellers do not die easy. No, we just die bloody. That's the Irish in us. When you and Dad hooked up... He ever talk to you about his vision? About what he wanted from the club? His vision was... you know... what it is. A brotherhood. Family. And running guns? He want that? We never talked about that. Why? Found a box of his old shit in the storage unit. Just like pictures and journals. Things I never knew about him. What kind of things? Seems like his original idea for the MC was something simpler. You know, social rebellion. He called it a Harley commune. It wasn't outlaw, it was real hippie shit. We had a lot of bright ideas back then. We were kids. Your father became a man. Men take care of business. Yeah, we do. You should get home, Mom. Finish cleaning tomorrow. I'll lock up. Okay, darling. Good night, Mom. Good night, baby. How are the hands, baby? It's just the damp. Where you been? Cleaning up at Jax's. Of course you were. All this stuff with Abel's pushing some old buttons, huh? It's not my buttons I'm worried about. Jax is going through some shit. Yeah. I know. Not just with the kid. What do you mean? He found a box of John's stuff in storage. He was asking me about his original vision for the club. Did he want to get into running guns. Tonight he said that maybe we shouldn't rebuild the factory. Shit. He's getting chewed up by that guilt. Remorse is a dangerous thing. Look what Tommy's death did to John. Changed him. Made him soft. You've gotta nail Jax down. You have to nail him down hard, Clay. Whatever it takes. I don't want the ghost of John Teller poisoning him, - ruining everything we've built. - Nothing is gonna get ruined, okay? Just don't throw your panic into high gear. They respect him. Jax is strong, and when you step down as... I'm not going anywhere. I know, baby. I know. It's just... When you can't ride anymore... They'll vote my son in as president. I just want to make sure he's following in the right father's footsteps. A little get-well present for your guy, Darby. That's some serious iron. Izzy'll like that. Thank you. Figured we'd give him something that had some balls. I know what it's like running a crew. Sometimes your guys do shit... without thinking things through. My guys are thinking just fine. They thinking fine when they sold crank to my pregnant ex? That was unfortunate. How's your little family doing, anyway? All right, all right, everybody contain your shit. Get off! - You done? - Yeah. Sorry, folks. Go back to your corndogs. Won't happen again. I made sure the brotherhood had Opie's back every minute {\that }he was in Chino, and you know that. Oh, I know how it works inside, Darby. Question is: do you remember how it works outside? - A lot changes in three years. - A lot stays the same. Nothing happens in Charming we don't control, or get a piece of. If we wanted a meth trade, we'd have one. - We don't. - You know the drill. I mean, you can cook all the crank you want along the border, but you do not deal in Charming. {\You know,}We ain't the only cook shop in town. Devil wants in, he'll get in. Well, then you got your work cut out for you. 'Cause the next time the devil crosses the border... I'm coming after you. And next time I'm not going to use a.357 as a get-well present. There's no need to be making threats, brother. Me and my boys have always managed to make things work with Sam Crow. Good. Milk and cookies are on us. Abel's stomach surgery went well, but it's putting a strain on his system. Dr. Namid doesn't want to wait. {\Thinks }We should do the heart surgery now. That's good, right? That they're not waiting? It's the best choice, yes. Thanks. Can we talk? What is it? Wendy's in really bad shape. She's still detoxing. Can't stop crying. And? I was hoping maybe you could talk to her. Just let her know she's not all alone. Trust me, nothing I'm going to say to that crank whore is going to make her feel loved. Forgot just how forthright you can be. You forgot a lot of things, sweetheart. If you have a problem with me assisting on Abel's case, - just say so. - You a good doctor? - Then I don't have a problem. - Good. People change. I'm not the same girl I was ten years ago. I am. Guess there's some things you can't change. I leave it there so I remember all that shit's behind me. Forgot just how clever you can be. Bitch. Mayans got two shops where they cut and bag the heroin. 20 minutes outside of Oakland here. Marcus Alvarez, president of the Oakland Charter, owns both buildings where they run their dope operations. Local cops are on a payroll, so it's a no-hassle gig. Which makes them lazy. Alvarez don't try too hard to cover his tracks. He also knows that we'd be onto the cut shops. We wouldn't take a chance housing the M-4's there. Stores them someplace off the grid. Backtracked one of Alvarez's dummy corporations in San Leandro, along the U-Pac rail line, here. Marcalva Industrial Storage. Way off the grid. Good work, kids. What are you doing? Got to make a run. - What's in the bag? - Nothing. - You promised {\me }you were done with this. - It's got nothing to do with you{\, Donna}. I'm the one who gets shit on if you get caught again. - It's not going to happen. - You sat in a cell for 5 years while Clay and the others got rich. They sold you out. You know that. You're just too weak to stand up to them. - Give me the bag. - No! - Give me the bag! - No! No! No! Stop it. Donna! Come on. Let's go inside. Didn't hear you pull up. Parked down the block. Didn't want to tweak Donna. - You catch all that? - Enough. I think she's already tweaked. Yeah. Stay here. I'll handle the run. I don't show up, Clay will chop off both our dicks. As soon as I leave, take your kid to the E.R. Tell them she hit her head{\ or something}. Just get a record of being there. I'll cover you with Sam Crow. What about the boom? I watched you do it before. I'll call you on the prepay if I need help. - You sure about this? - Go fix your family. Why didn't you tell me about your kid? I didn't know what to say. Still don't. - Where's Ope? - Kid got hurt. Had to take her to the hospital. Got the bag. I can make it work. It's all good, brother. - How does that sound? - That was good. That was beautiful, babe. It's "All Shook Up." Bobby, Jesus, what are you doing here? - Simon, what the hell is that? - I'm booked. Tonight, tomorrow, five shows. I got a new girl in booking. Dumb bitch doubled up my acts. Well, goddamn it, Simon. Just tell Chun King to take a hike. I got six busloads of Korean tourists coming in. They love Asian Elvis. I'll get you next month, Bobby. Better luck next time, bubba. Thank you. Thank you very much. Who is it? The Colonel. Oh, sweet Jesus! Oh, Mama, help me! Oh, sweet Jesus! Praise Jesus, it's a miracle. I've got the rest over here. Get the guns in the van. Wire this shithole up. Shit. - What the hell is the problem? - Nothing. Just got to check something with Ope. Guns are loaded. What's the holdup? We got company. - Got to be the Mayans. - Yeah. Get the van out of sight. Lay low. You... with me. Open it. Check the electric panel. Okay, man. Shit. Should have been long gone by now. We got the iron. Let's get the hell out of here. I came to send a message. Those two wetbacks see that busted back door, they'll call for backup. Blowing up shit's one thing. We off these guys, could trigger something runs out of control. That's the cost of your mistake. You got a problem making it right? I'll draw 'em to the Dumpster. Tell your dirtbag buddies, they camp out here, they get some of this. No, bang, bang, <i>por favor</i>. You tell your dirtbag buddies, they steal from Sam Crow, they get some of this. I got him. Holy shit. Go check the back. Make sure that's all of them. He's all yours. BP's dropping. - Get the paddles. - Charging. Keep clear. Check the leads. Prepare to massage the heart. I'm all right. Got the vest. Finish it. It's finished. Mary, Mother of Christ! I leave you bad boys for two minutes, and it all turns to shit! We're all good. - Let's get out of here. - Clay. Look at this. Darby's guy. Looks like Darby did make some new friends in Chino. White boy must've sucked lots of brown dick. Nords crew up with the Mayans, gives 'em numbers, access to guns. And a common enemy: us. Darby wants Charming. There goes the neighborhood. Sinus rhythm's back. O2 sats are coming up. Candle's in the cake. Let's go home. Looks like the boy might actually see his first birthday. He made it? Oh, Abel, thank God! Thank you, God. Maybe... we should say a little prayer. Okay. That'd be good. Dear God, thank you for saving this boy... From his murderous junkie mom, who cared more about a $40 rush than she did her own flesh and blood. - Don't you dare... - Don't I dare? You pathetic whore. Guess the D.A. was impressed with your Bible studies. Hear they're not gonna press charges. When I check out of here, I'm going into Promises. Let's just throw money at those 12-step freaks. How long is it gonna last this time? Six months? Three? Couple of weeks? It's gonna be different this time. This time I have my baby to live for. That's where you're wrong. You have no baby. You lost that privilege. You so much as cast a shadow on that kid, try to turn some legal screw and get custody... I will finish this job. He will never... call you Mommy. I suggest you turn to Jesus. Is he gonna be okay? It looks good.
