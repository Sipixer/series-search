things I never knew about him. When you and Dad hooked up, he {\ever }talk to you about his vision, - about what he wanted from the club? - Jax is going through some shit. He's asking me if John wanted to get into running guns? Tonight he said that maybe we shouldn't rebuild the factory. I want to make sure he's following in the right father's footsteps. Let's go into the photo booth. Come on, let me give you a quick hand job. I already got a picture of that. This time it'll bemy hand. You been a bad girl. Hey, Clay. - How you doing, Elliot? - Okay, Clay. Karen. Mom, I'm gonna go on the Spin-Out again. - {\Tristen,}You've been on it four times already. - I know. Here. - That's not necessary. - That's all right. They kicked me off 'cause I was screaming too loud. What do you say? - Thanks. - You got it. We gotta go. Bye. - Come on. - Come on. Man, you'd think with all that money they could pay someone to remove those sticks shoved up their asses. Maybe he's just a little paranoid some of his country club cronies are gonna see him talking to the outlaw. Come on. I need to talk to the outlaw. Your daddy throws like your mommy. He wear a bra and panties to your games? Come on, try it again, hot shot. Come on. Where are you going? Five more bucks, your son'll be convinced you're a loser. Darby's guys? I don't recognize them. Look at the big, bad bikers. Gonna get Clowny all wet, huh? Hey, you guys, come on. Let's go! - Come on, Jax. Come on. - Hey, let's go! What's a matter, tough guy? Can't put the little ball in the tight hole? Bet all your leather-wearing butt buddies say the same thing. That's a Bozo no-no. Jesus, you guys. All right, man. Come on! Smile boy. You're going down. - Got that cotton candy? - Yeah. - Nice. - There you go. Thank you very much, man. I can barely see it. Gimme that. The Irish are coming. - Go find the others. - Okay. Sorry, baby. I might have to... - finish you off later. - I heard that before. Gimme some more quarters. I'm going back in the booth. Think the prospect's deep enough? May only have one nut, but it's a big one. - I trust him. - Hey, prospect! Come on over here. Learn a thing. Hurry up. Don't get hit. - Don't screw this up, Sack. - Good to see you, Michael. Why'd you bring the ladies here? Russian ladies. .62s and AKs. Fresh from the Kremlin. Got all the parts. A couple of assembled samples. - Got some Russky iron. - AKs? God bless Gorbachev. Yeah, you got that right. Mayans torched the warehouse where we store and assemble our weapons. Holy shite, what does that do to your business? We just bought nine acres on the edge of Amador County. We start rebuilding, we'll be up and running in 2 or 3 months. Can't you assemble them here? We learned our lesson the hard way: we don't cross our money streams. This is strictly a legit automotive business. So that means you'll go three months without buying the weapons from us? - Sam Crow's a huge piece of our income. - Gotta make the adjustment, all right? I mean, it's part of business. This isn't a business for us, brother. True IRA, we're not merchants, we're soldiers. The guns we sell fuel the cause. Without it, we lose ground. We support the cause, McKeavy. Shit like this just happens. We'll have our guns up and running in no time. That's the problem. No time. Three weeks would cripple us. - Three months, we can't wait for that. - What the hell are you saying? I'm saying, if you can't front us the cash to cover your downtime, we're gonna have to find a new buyer. I've been buying guns from you for over a decade, Michael. When you split from Adams, I stayed with you, 'cause of our friendship. You stayed with me 'cause the other cowards sold out. We're the only outlaws left. Now, don't take this personal, Clay. Your warehouse burning down is a casualty of commerce. You lose our guns, that's a casualty of war. Tristen! What's going on? We can't find Tristen. Jesus. She must be here somewhere. - No, we've looked everywhere. - She's not on any of the rides. Oh, my God. {\fad(500,500)}Episode 103: Fun Town by the Santiag Team McKeavy's gonna want his usual per-month order {\pos(192,210)}- and a month's insurance. - I can't get my hands on $200K. {\pos(192,210)}I got every spare cent tied up in the rebuild. {\pos(192,210)}So what do I tell him? {\pos(192,210)}- How much time do we have? - Well, he's going up north tomorrow, don't know for how long, but when he gets back, he'll want his cash before he goes to Dungloe. {\pos(192,230)}Tell the shamrock I'll give him his money. {\pos(192,230)}But I want you to go with him... {\pos(192,230)}Courtesy escort. {\pos(192,230)}Let me know who he's meeting with. {\pos(192,230)}- Who's the dude in the Benz? - Elliot Oswald. {\pos(192,230)}As in Oswald Lumber? {\pos(192,230)}Yeah, Oswald Lumber, Oswald Beef, Oswald Construction. {\pos(192,230)}My daughter's still in shock. She doesn't remember much. {\pos(192,230)}Asshole busted her in the jaw and threw her down in the dirt. Raped her. She's 13 years old. What did the cops say? {\pos(192,220)}Took a report. Hale's out looking. I want you to find him. You bring him to me first. Pay anything you want. What do you think we are, Elliot? Oswalds have been in this town a lot longer than Sam Crow. I know what you are. I don't want your money. Nobody comes into my town and does this to an innocent girl. We'll find the sick bastard. But... When I deliver him to you, I'm gonna need to know that justice will be served. You know what I'm saying... old friend? {\pos(192,210)}We got a $200K deficit hanging over our heads. {\pos(192,210)}Do we really, really want to be out there {\pos(192,210)}playing some pro bono Lone Ranger? {\pos(192,210)}Guy raped a 13-year-old. {\pos(192,210)}13. I get it. I just don't like putting my ass on the line for some outsider. {\pos(192,180)}Clay, Oswald doesn't give a shit about Sam Crow. {\pos(192,210)}You know, people get jammed up in this town, they don't go to the cops. {\pos(192,210)}- They come to us. - That's right, guys. And that means something to me. I don't know. {\pos(192,210)}Maybe I got something to prove with this guy{\, you know}. {\pos(192,210)}That's my shit. So... Anybody wants a pass on this... - We're in. - No way. - I'm in. - I'm in. We're in. I'm in. I'm in, too. Guess we're hunting the tot-banger then. Good. {\So, }What do we know? We saw a couple guys sporting Aryan ink. Not sure if they were Darby's guys. Macon Woods is right on the Lodi border. {\pos(192,210)}Darby's got a meth shack a couple of miles from there. Rape as retaliation. Certainly in the Nord wheelhouse. Tap into the Sanwa database. {\pos(192,210)}Find out which Nords get hard for underage pussy. - {\pos(192,210)}Got it. - Bobby and I'll go after Darby. What's so urgent, Dad? You know Leo Kessler, Kessler Builders? - Hi. - Hi, Leo. - I'm kinda in the middle of something. - We know. We heard about Oswald's daughter. - Terrible thing. - What is this about? We're pretty sure Elliot's been talking to Clay Morrow. Safe to assume he's probably looking for some vigilante justice. - Sam Crow is looking for the rapist? - Yes. And, if they deliver... We may have a problem. Oswald's very close to selling us and our investors two land parcels off of County 17. It's over 130 acres. Elliot loves that kid more than anything. God knows what he'll do to the guy if Clay hands him over. Puts Elliot in bed with Sam Crow. And we know how Clay feels about expansion. You need to make sure you find this guy first. Due process of the law. We all want the same thing, son: Charming to grow and prosper. Right. I think you two are leaning a little heavier on the prosper angle. I gotta get back to work. You girls selling cookies? We're investigating a sexual assault. You serious? I need to talk to all your guys that were at the carnival last night. If they're not here, get them here now. You think a Son had something to do with that rape? Half of 'em have violent crimes on their rap sheets. Just following logic. Wasn't it just last week four Oakland cops were busted for prostitution and rape? Logic tells me we should ask where your dick was last night. Don't say, "In your mama." Officers Mann and Fain will be taking your statements. Could take hours. I'm trying to run a business here. We can do it here, at the station house, wherever you want to do it. And don't say, "In your mama." Feeling better? A little dopey... So to speak. When you're feeling stronger, I'll take you to see your son. Yeah, okay. Has Jax been around? I don't know. They said you had a friend smuggle in that syringe of meth. I just signed the affidavit. The hospital's a little nervous about the liability issues. I'm sure they are. What? The two women who loved Jackson Teller... Could we be at more opposite ends of the shit spectrum? We're not that different. Save it, sweetheart. I don't need a pep talk. I know what I am. So do I, and you're not suicidal. You didn't have anyone smuggle in that dose. I have a {\pretty }good idea who {\might }may have delivered it. - Don't go down that road. - She the one who injected you? I stared at that five-mil tube for over an hour, and then I pumped it into my favorite vein, end of story. Why? God, if you don't know why, then you and me are nothing alike. I'm glad I'm not sick. You're a tough doctor to track down. You okay? Just... work. Oswald girl? End of the hall. We went to get ice cream. We told her to wait by the ride if she finished before we got back. The guy {\working the ride }said that she waited for a few minutes, then she went to the arcade. Any reason why she would go there? Was she meeting someone? Even if it seems trivial, the smallest detail can help. We don't know anything else. Sorry. I know this is hard on you and Karen. I can't imagine what you're going through. But anger clouds judgment, and it makes us do things that we end up regretting. Things that we can never take back. The only thing I can never take back is what happened to that little girl. All right, yeah. Yo, I gotta head back to TM. Charming PD's grilling everyone that was at the carnival. Jax wants you to follow Hale, - keep tabs on him. - Follow him on what? I can't believe these assholes are taking another coffee break. Total jerkoff. Hale must know we're looking for the guy. We're gonna be here all day. Two double tranqaccinos coming up. - Looking at a 12-hour nap. - Nice. Coming for refills. Fresh pot, boys. It's hot. Jackson? No, thank you. Juice should be here soon, Clay. Sometimes he gets lost. That was quick. Good to the last drop. - That's so bad. - Don't fall on the floor. Been talking to the Fun Town carnies for over an hour. Stay on him. Think you guys could double up? Let me take one of your bikes? Not unless he grows tits. Big tits. Huge tits. He's going. See this girl last night? - Who are you? - Concerned citizens. And what did you just say to that cop? Why don't you ask him yourself? - 'Cause we're asking you, Uncle Vinky. - It's all right. This girl got raped less than a mile away. Shit like that doesn't happen in our town, which points to an outsider. And there's not much more outsiders than you muppets. - You can go that way if you want. - What? All right, tell you what I told the cop. All my guys were here powering down rides, chaining up booths. Security guards your town hired'll tell you the same thing. That's right. Wendy's out of detox. Thought you'd want to know just in case you wanted to bring her flowers or something. We got no sign of Darby. Looked at the cook shacks, his house, the Dog. Looked all over for that guy. Maybe he's gone underground. Three of Darby's guys have done time for sex crimes. Two are still in P Bay. Others, Johnny Yates, got a PO Box in Pope. We saw this guy at the carnival yesterday. You sure? Hang on. I'm in the middle of it, baby. Still looking for Darby? - Yeah. Why? - He's at the hospital, - heading up to the south wing. - Thank you. Darby's at St. Thomas. Finish prepping the AKs, put 'em in the duffle, - full clips. - Got it. - Put these in my box. - What are they? They're vitamins, vitamins. Give us a minute, Floyd. - I'll give ya two. - All right. Jesus Christ. My one peaceful moment of the day. Need to know where Hale's at with the Oswald case. Do you have any idea how much heat I'm getting on this? I do anything to compromise this case... I'm not asking you to compromise. Just tell us what you know. Got nothing. No leads, no witnesses. Only one that knows anything is the girl, and she's saying she's got no memory of it. And Karen won't let anyone near her. Guess I don't blame her. Probably'd do the same if it was my kid. All right. Jax, you guys cannot screw me on this. I don't catch this rapist, I'm the one under the microscope. That's just bad for all of us. Don't worry, Chief. We'll catch him. Shit. Shit. How you doing, Ernie? It's going good. How's the beautiful queen of bikers? Holding it together. What brings you here? Four packs a day finally caught up to Mom. Stage 4 lung cancer. Sorry to hear that. You look real good, Gemma. - Clay must be keeping you happy. - Does the best he can. Interesting new accessory. Picked it up at my little retreat in Chino. It's simple, but it says it. Jewish doctors keeping your mother alive must love it. That's right, you got a little Jew in you, don't you? A bit. On the angry Russian side. Nice talking to you, Ernie. Gotta catch my train back to Auschwitz. - Your old lady's still a handful. - That she is. {\My guys tell me}You've been looking for me. Think we had something to do with the raped kid{\that kid getting raped last night}? Thought crossed my mind. Tearing up the daughter of an important citizen like that. You know, maybe that's your way of pissing on Charming ground. When I decide to piss on Charming, it ain't gonna be on a little girl. We know about your hookup with the Mayans. I'm guessing you and Alvarez got kinda cozy in Chino. I'm just trying to learn how to get along with my brothers of color. Opening my mind to bigger possibilities. Well, don't think too big. Small mind suits you. Last night, what, what? All my guys were with me. We ate at Meyers, then we shot pool at the Dog. Ask around. - What about Johnny Yates? - Yates? He ain't with us. That boy never fit in. He pissed off Whistler one night, {\shattered}wracked Johnny's nose. Didn't see him again. You do remember Whistler? Yeah. I remember him. Don't see him around much anymore. Yeah, he just fell off the face of the Earth. It's funny how easy that can happen. Why don't you and me straighten out our business another time? Right now, I need an address on Yates. No, I ain't gonna rat him out to you{\, Clay}. Ain't gonna happen. He's got a half a dozen sex crimes on his rap sheet. Now, if he raped that girl, the quicker I find him, the quicker the eyes are off both of us. Hey, yo. His mother raised fighting dogs up in Pope. He used to stay with her. I think she remarried. Last name is Chester. Thanks. Whatever shit you stir up, make sure the Nords stay clear of it. Call Trammel, see if he can scare up an address on Mother Yates. I want bodies on this. You think Darby could be setting us up? I don't know. But if he does tip off Yates, we could be walking into an angry whiteout. - Do I even ask? - No. No, you don't. Juice. Juice? {\Juice?!} Get the AKs. Come on. Let's go. - Looks like a full house. - The guys on the porch are armed. - Not sure about the ones in the back. - Take down the ones at the cages. - We'll get the lookouts. Let's go. - No clips. - What?! Goddamn, empty. - There's no clip. - Goddamn Juice. Back door. Counting 20. I haven't acted out sexually in over three years. And all these men will vouch for me. I'm a saved man. I guess we got some bad information. Sorry. A little misunderstanding. Forget about our little mistake... we'll forget about Mom's illegal mutts. It's not too late for you men. Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior can save you. He can deliver you from all your transgressions. I appreciate your zeal, padre, but my transgressions... - all I got left. - Amen. My Lord, The Kumbaya. Kumbaya. My lord The Kumbaya. They think they're protecting her by building a wall around her. Tristen needs to talk to somebody. And I need something, anything to help catch this guy, so we're not doing this again with another girl. I know Karen needs to send some insurance forms. I'll try to get an admin to keep her busy for a while. Thank you. I need a favor, too. It's more of a question really. - It's going to sound very dramatic. - Okay. If I had a restraing order against someone in another city, would it still be valid if I went someplace else? That all depends. Every state's a little different. You think that someone might be coming here? No, no, I doubt it. There was this guy I dated during my internship in Chicago. Things got weird. He got a little... It's hard to explain. {\Well}Want to give me his name? I'll run it through the system. {\No, }That's okay. I'm just being paranoid. How long ago did you get the RO? About six or seven months ago. I'll make some general calls, okay? - See if it's still in play out here. - Thanks. What the hell are you doing here? Something to brighten up your room. I understand you and the old girlfriend have become buddies. It's a little late for the panic button. I didn't say anything to anyone. That's smart. No one would believe you anyhow. That whole junkie thing. All I did was give you an option, sweetheart. You're the one who took the coward's way out. - You couldn't even do that right. - We all can't be rocks like you, Mother Gemma. I don't know how you do it. What's that? Keep all the lies straight. All the dirty little secrets buried. Your conscience must be locked up real tight. Nothing gets in the way of me taking care of my family. Especially my conscience. But then you obviously can't grasp that. Being a baby killer and all. Need something, sweetie? Just some water for these flowers. Don't want 'em dying on us. - She holds the key. - I did not give you permission to question my daughter. I wasn't questioning her, ma'am. I was just seeing how she was feeling. Bullshit. I'm not going to let you people traumatize her again. You leave her the hell alone. What an idiot. Probably thought it was speed. I want something very special. Yeah. "Ride like the wind. The wheels go round." I'll be back. {\- Hey. - Hey.} - Thought you guys were on the hunt. - Hit a dead end. - The junkie's awake. - Don't call her that. All right. Sorry. You think he can really hear you? Yes. I do. - Did you find the guy? - No, not yet. We need you to talk to Tristen{\your daughter again}. She{\Tristen} doesn't remember anything after she got off the ride. Got to dig a little deeper. We need something. The guy in the car, was he black, - was he white... - She's still in shock. Karen just wants her to rest. Look, man, Tristen's our only shot at finding this asshole. Do you want our help? I'll talk to Karen. You find him. Hi, sweetie. You feeling any better? Guess there's a lot of people asking you questions. My mom told me to text her if anyone - tried to... - It's okay, honey. Your mom and I are old friends. She told me everything. I am so sorry that happened to you. She told you? Don't worry, baby. It's going to be okay. Had a little conversation with Tristen. What?! Why would you be talking to my daughter? I told her I knew about the secret. She seemed relieved. What the hell did you say to her? She remembers everything, doesn't she? You don't want the trial... messy press. You just want to sweep it under the rug. Don't you judge me. I'm not judging you. You don't know me. And I got no idea what it's like to be you. But I know something about burying the truth. And it's a burden that you never want to put on a kid. Tristen has to know that this really happened. Make her hide it... lie about it... it'll come back and shit on every relationship she ever has. That rich, happy life you've worked so hard to give her, you just kiss it good-bye. If they arrest this guy, everyone puts a face to the crime. And then it becomes real. And for the rest of her life in Charming, she's not going to be Tristen. She's going to be the girl that was raped at Fun Town. Sweetheart, in her head, she'll always be the girl who was raped at Fun Town. Only thing worse than everyone knowing is no one knowing. Karen Oswald came clean. One of the carney guys raped Tristen. Fat guy dressed like a clown. Jesus. Does Hale know? Not yet. I can't stop her from telling him. Shit. Thanks, Mom. Goddamn it! Hear you guys are harboring a fugitive. - What are you going to do about it? - Citizen's arrest. Got him! Let's go! Come on. What happened here? Nothing. Find him! Shut up. Here's the scumbag raped your little girl. Cattle guys call this an Elsie-maker. It's used to cut the balls off of bulls. Strip him. Jesus! He deserves every second of the pain. What are you going to do here, Elliot? We had a deal. Sorry. I'm sorry. I... - Hold him still. - Clay! - Let him bleed out. - Shit. Holy shit! Bury him in the woods. Mark the grave. Pick those up and gift wrap 'em. Put this in a bag. Make sure you don't touch it. - It's got Oswald's prints all over it. - What the hell are we doing here? Taking out some real estate insurance. Making sure Oswald doesn't sell off those tracts of lumber acreage. You knew this was coming whether Oswald had the nerve or not. This whole hunt was about blackmail. Well, actually, the leverage was just a fortunate byproduct of my community spirit. Hey, you want me to be your #2, protect this club, then I gotta know where you're taking us. Otherwise, there's no trust. And if you and me don't trust each other, Sam Crow's got a problem. If Oswald's land goes commercial, that means housing developments. Population rises, brings more cops, more state and federal involvement. Charming goes Disney. And Sam Crow gets squeezed out by the most dangerous gang of all: old white money. Now you know. "When we take action to avenge the ones we love,</i> "personal justice collides with social and divine justice.</i> "We become judge, jury and God. "With that choice comes daunting responsibility.</i> "Some men cave under that weight. Others abuse the momentum.</i> "The true outlaw finds the balance between the passion in his heart</i> "and the reason in his mind. "His solution is always an equal mix of might and right."</i> Here's all that stuff you requested, Agent Kohn. Only thing that flagged in Charming was an outlaw MC charter... Sons of Anarchy. No charges in over five years, but past offenses have been smuggling and gunrunning. - Thanks. - Okay. I don't want you hurting yourself, Wendy. Not over this. What happened to Abel is not your fault. Yeah. I'm powerless. That bullshit excuse is even getting old to me. It's not that. Us getting back together. I knew that would turn bad. I don't want to be married. No way I was ready for a kid. When you got pregnant, I hated you. Hated that you gave him a name. So I bailed. Him born tweaking, his belly hanging out... that's on me, babe. Look at him. He's so small. He's so small, Jax. What did I do? I'm sorry, little boy. I'm so sorry. Now what? He stays in the toaster till he can throw a punch. We ship your ass off to rehab. Again. Thank you, Jax. Thank you. Hey, idiot. Wake up. You must have really pissed off your buddies. Shit. Come on. Get out of here before I slap an indecent exposure on you. Sorry, Chief. I'm not sure what... I gotta go. SLIGHTLY RETARDED CHILD I'm late for my 8:00 feeding. Officer! Yes? Agent Kohn, ATF. Chicago Three Division. Deputy Chief, Hale. What brings you here? I'm working in interstate weapons case. Outlaw crew in your town maybe involved, Sons of Anarchy.
