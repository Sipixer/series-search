Four years on the street is a long time, dr. Gallagher. You want me to stay on it? Of course. At the same level? If you need more people, it isn't be an issue. I'm staying. You might wanna scale back. Why would I do that? Rebecca's name and picture has been out to the police, The neighbourhood, and any shelter, aid organization, church Every clinic in the area for months. I can't say we're any closer to finding your sister Than were the first day you walked into my office. I'm trying to be straight with you. I appreciate it. Same level. Ethan! You have to take your meds. They make me sleepy. Even so... What if he calls? He'll call back. What if he doesn't? Bottoms up. He promised that he'd call. Calloway, Ethan. Obsessive Delusional Disorder. You know, why don't I stay here for a little while? Just in case? There you are. It's okay, ethan. [ beeping ] [ sniffs ] [ sighs ] [ exhales deeply ] [ doorbell buzzes ] [ buzzing continues ] Hey, stranger. Rebecca? [ both laugh ] How did you get here? I don't know. i -- I-i don't know. it -- it just happened, jack. I -- i woke up, and i was back. Are you okay? i-i can't explain it. Sit down. sit down. I don't know if it will last, but i'm here. You -- you okay? [ voice breaking ] i tried to speak, But i couldn't. When i called and you talked to me... I know. I know. I want to get better, jack. We're gonna make that happen. [ breathing heavily ] I'm gonna get you some water. Okay. it's okay. [ chuckles weakly ] Are you hungry? what can i get you to eat? [ chuckles ] surprise me. Omelet -- um, spinach, mushrooms. [ microwave beeping ] [ sighs ] My computer is fine, Carl. Mm, it's obsolete. it is a doorstop, as is mine. oh, which is the point of this conversation.</i> What's the point? Oh, carl wants a new, upgraded company laptop. He assumes if i join in the chorus, you'll be more likely to lend your support.</i> Why would carl assume that? well, carl thinks you favor me. ridiculous.</i> I think i favor carl. Ridiculous that this hospital expects us to do our jobs Lacking the requisite tools. Hard-drive envy. It's a guy thing. Ira: carl! Ira. how are ya? Slumming? You know i enjoy these visits to loony land. Uh, dr. gallagher, ira greenbaum, Senior staff, neurology. Zan's dr. gallagher? What brings you? Oh, transferring a patient -- Bauer, william -- new-onset asthma, Atypical retinal signs, thermoregulatory dysfunction. Requiring the services of a pulmonary specialist, Endocrinologist, and ophthalmologist. Done, done, and, oh, done. Also, infectious diseases, Allergic medicine, and neurology. We all drew blanks. he's not symptomatic? Well, his symptoms are real enough. They're just not physiologically based. Could be multisystem conversion disorder, Something in the somatoform family? My god, sherlock, you've cracked the case! Obviously, i'm in the right place. Yeah. I'll, uh, e-mail his file. [ indistinct conations ] Be right back. There you go. Tell me about the accident, billy. [ exhales ] It was about four -- four months ago on a site. You work construction. Yeah, i'm getting my contractor's license. [ sighs ] "was." What happened? we were tearing down this old apartment building.</i> we were excavating the basement,</i> when i thought i was clear of the pit,</i> but the ground gave way underneath me.</i> it took them about eight hours to dig me out.</i> Must have been terrifying, being swallowed up like that. yeah. dark? pretty much. cold? [ exhales sharply ] real cold. Must have been a lot of dust in the air, What little air there was. [ chuckling ] yeah. i still wake up every morning choking.</i> [ coughs ] You all right? No. [ exhales sharply ] [ sniffs ] [ groans ] [ shivering ] Mr. bauer... You could have been killed. Instead, you survived an accident With only minor injuries. You might consider yourself fortunate. Well, i can't drive. I can't work. I can't go to school. I can barely get around. i feel very fortunate, thank you.</i> Carl: you wanted to see me? William bauer. Somatoform disorder, Possibly heightened by latent claustrophobia, Activated by the accident. you do know about the accident.</i> I read the file. Well, then, you realize the correspondence Between what bauer experienced while buried And the symptoms now are too exact to be coincidental. He's immobilized, in fear of his life. He's cold, can't see, can't breathe. Symptoms you accentuated By feeding the patient images during intake. Now, why would i do that? To validate your diagnosis. Treatment options. Carl: pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. With an ssri to elevate mood And the right sleep medication and a good talk therapist, Billy's life should resume normal patterns Within a fairly short period of time. That's optimistic. no, it is not. Bauer's a healthy young man With no prior history of psychological disturbance. What about the time gap -- Three months between the accident And the onset of physical symptoms? how does that sit with conversion?</i> You think i'm giving the patient short shrift, A too-quick diagnosis leading to a hasty prescription. what do you think? I think your bloated ego Occasionally clouds your judgment. Occasionally? Rylan. Hola. You don't smoke. i don't smoke around you.</i> Today's the exception. Okay, what the hell happened? Nora told me you walked out on a patient in the e.r.? Well... Nora, as usual, is... Very well-informed. It's true? With an explanation. What, you're joking about this? That is the essential rylan moore -- Service with a smile. Ugh. cut the crap. [ sighs ] Paramedics brought in a prostitute -- Christine. Apparently, one of christine's johns demanded a refund And when she objected, stuck a knife between her legs. We managed to stop the bleeding, but, uh, she's very close. As we were finishing up with chrtine, Police brought in the john -- He had a gsw to the right shoulder, Resisting arrest. He was very lucky. it barely clipped him. Well, you've dealt with similar situations Dozens of times. I probably would have helped this case, too, If he hadn't opened his mouth. And said? "let the whore bleed." You should go home. I was thinking the same thing. Want to come? I'm in the middle of my shift. Right. I could see you later. I'm thinking about driving up the coast, Maybe spend a couple nights in santa barbara. We talked about doing that. You know i can't. Then i'll see you when i get back. Yeah, good. [ sighs ] How's billy doing? He's not so good. Damn. i really liked that kid -- Always on time, good attitude, smart, steady, you know? And then this. My business manager keeps telling me To expect a lawyer letter -- suing my ass for damages. But i don't think billy would do that. Do you think the accident was your company's fault? It occurred on my site. Is that really what started all this? It set something in motion. The timing's too coincidental. I don't know. What can you tell me about it? Come on. i'll show you -- that way. It happened down here. The ground just gave way without warning. It's all filled in now. I didn't see the collapse, But i came running when i heard the shouting. Wewhat did you see? Must have been an old air shaft Predating the building we were demolishing -- About six feet across. Billy landed about 20 feet down. I suppose these things happen, just not to me. You saying it hurt your business? No, not really. it made all the local news channels. Everyone loves a happy ending. Having one of your employees buried alive? What? what's this "buried alive" crap? Billy wasn't buried? Hell no! Like i said, he fell about 20 feet below the surface, He could see out, And the rescue team in at all times. He could breathe? His legs were trapped, But he could still move his arms and his head. He spent most of the eight hours Chatting up the cute little paramedic looking over him -- Annie. The only reason why i know her name Is because afterward, billy and she dated. Was it cold that day? In l.a.? Ethan. What if he calls? Well, if he calls... What are you expecting him to say? He'll advise me. He'll tell me what to do. mm-hmm. about what exactly?</i> My life... Whatever i need. You never actually met your grandfather, did you? He died when i was So, without knowing who you are -- At least, the man who you are today -- Do you think it's possible That he could dispense good advice? He watches over me. But he didn't say that, did he, The first time that he spoke to you on -- on -- on the radio? Not exactly. No. what? what exactly? I told you. He said, "stay tuned. Big changes are comin'." Yeah. but why not more? I mean, he had you right there on the line. why not say then exactly what he wanted you to hear?</i> Well, i don't know. D-do you think that there's a problem? What if the problem isn't with your grandfather? what if the problem is actuay with you?</i> Oh, god. what have i done? No, ethan, it's okay. What i'm actually suggesting is that... Maybe your grandfather is waiting For you to be ready to listen. Ready how? Calmer, more in control of yourself, Not so tied up in knots. And i think -- I think that's what your grandfather Probably wants to talk to you about, more or less. Well... Am i ready to listen, dr. jones? I believe you are. [ gasps lightly ] [ coughs ] [ groaning ] Malcolm, i've got a code! Hurry it up! Room 102 is coding. get a crash cart. [ coughs ] Come on. i need ice-cold towels. Weeed to get his temp down. got it. Hurry it up! come on! [ groans ] here you go, doctor. [ breathing heavily ] Nurse: put it under him. You need more, doctor? What the hell is this? [ beeping ] On this ward, we don't always succeed with our patients, And how we measure success is debatable. but we don't typically come this close to killing them.</i> Mr. bauer's temperature is back to normal. He appears to have suffered no ill effects. His temp spiked at 106. Any higher, we might have lost him. Do we have any ideas at all? Although i admit the severity And range of psycho-symptomatic response is startling, The diagnosis stands -- somatoform disorder. Considering the relatively benign circumstances Of the accident, none of it makes sense. Are we even sure that that's what caused it? The logic is unassailable. We're not set up for critical care. We can't endanger this manife. We can't just turf him back to the main hospital. That's too dangerous. Well, what do you , jack? I need more time with the patient. mine. my patient.</i> I'll take responsibility. Tell me what you're seeing, billy. Billy: it's the same -- dim, blurry. I used to be able to make out shapes, And now, unless i'm close Or something's right in front of me, I can't make out any detail at all. [ scoffs ] I'm gonna end up totally blind, won't i? I want to build things, dr. gallagher. I want to plan them. i want to create them. I want to see them through. It's the only thing in life that i've ever been sure of. You told carl belle... That, um, you're having trouble sleeping, That you'd wake up choking. Is there anything else? I have these dreams. They startbout a month after the accident. The other doctors -- they couldn't care less. I'm not the other doctors. No, i know. You don't think i'm faking it. You think i'm a nut case. So why don't you tell me everything? What difference would it make? Probably won believe you anyway. What about these dreams? It's dark. I'm walking through some kind of cave or tunnel. I'm either freezing cold, or else i'm -- I'm -- i'm -- i'm burnint. I'm scared. i've...never been that scared. Something in the air leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It's like metal. There's a cask filled with water, But it's so cold that the top is frozen. So i have to break the ice. And i see myself In the reflection, Only...it's not me -- Older, dirtier. I have a bandage over my eye. How can i dream that i'm somebody else? I spoke to tom hearst. His version of the accident is way different than yours. Well, i'm sorry if i gave anyone the wrong impression. I wasn't exactly buried, was i? No. With everything, i get a little confused. You mentioned annie. Yeah. We don't see each other anymore. Wh that? She split. Look at me. i can't blame her. Nora: have you talked to rylan? Briefly. he went out of town. I'm seeing him tomorrow night. The disciplinary committee is meeting tomorrow afternoon. What do you think? It depends on his reaction And whether this guy wants to sue the hospital For malpractice. So what should he do? Come up with an excuse -- any reasonable excuse -- And stick to it. He's got a good reputation. people like him. He's likable. How you holding up? I've just never seen him look so unhappy before. [ breathing shallowly ] Annie jester. Right there. Annie: [ clears throat ] i told you. i just got here. All right. bye. [ cellphone beeps ] Annie? dr. gallagher. Hi. thanks for coming in. did i get you out of work? Oh, it's okay. billy's here? yeah. Since when? Checked himself into the main hospital About two weeks ago. We've had him, oh, less than two days. When was the last time you saw him, spoke to him? Since we broke up, almost two months? I didn't know about any of this. Shortness of breath, nightmares, sweats, chills? No, none of it. How long were you two together? [ beep ] Four weeks. I know that doesn't sound like much. Maybe it had something to do with how we met, But we just clicked right away. It was intense, you know, like it was meant to be. Sure. That's why it hurt so bad when he dumped me. he dumped you? One day, out of the blue, He told me he didn't want to see me anymore. It was really hard. Are you ready for this? Look, consider this. It was around about the time that you two broke up That billy started having these physical symptoms -- Nightmares, and, in particular, his loss of vision. You're saying he broke up with me So i wouldn't have to go through this with him? Do you want to help? [ knock on door ] Billy? I brought you a visitor. Billy. It's me. it's annie. The paramedic ex-girlfriend? How did you know? Tom hearst. This... Might not be a good idea. Because i'm breaking protocol, Bringing in a surprise visitor to see a patient? Nothing you do surprises me anymore. If you had come to see me Before going to see billy's employer, I could have saved you a trip. Instead, you went behind my back. If there's anyone here who has a tendency To pursue private agendas, it's you. I didn't know you were keeping score. Anything else i should know? [ inhales sharply ] You might want to ask billy The name of the apartment building They were demolishing when he was trapped. What's that got to do with anything? aah! annie: dr. gallagher!</i> What's wrong? let me help. no! my legs! Come on. lay back. I'll help you.it's okay. Dr. Gallagher! [ groaning ] Oh, my legs! Ohh! what the hell is happening?! [ groaning ] Nora: an allergic reaction. Some new solvent that they're using In the hospital laundry. At least that's the theory, anyhow. Are you buying this? it's nonsense. Well, there haven't been any other similar reactions From any other patients in any section of the hospital. What's your explanation of this? Soing else. Carl: mr. bauer exists In a heightened state of somatic reactivity. Had he been started on the drug regimen i suggested, Which dr. gallagher overruled, This would not have happened. Billy's extremely reactive and...suggestible. He's living out his nightmares. We've got a very sick kid Who's been prodded and probed and tested And passed around until his headpinning. He's too hot. he's too cold. He's choking. he, uh -- he's beding. He can't see, and nobody knows why. This is not somatoform disorder. And unless we dig deeper... We've failed him miserably. [ siren wailing in distance ] I don't want to see her again. Why not? [ scoffing ] look at what happened. You connect that to annie? What's the connection, billy? She was in the dreams. Can you be more specific? I'm buried. it's dark. I-i can't move. i'm freezing cold. Man: we need some oxygen! I can't breathe. My -- my legs hurt. Everything hurts. I look up, and i see her leaning over the pit. It doesn't look like her, but somehow i know it is. And she's looking down at me, and she's smiling. And there's -- there's other -- other people around me, But they're dead -- their bodies are cold. and i just -- i just want to scream at her.</i> I want to scream at her to stop smiling, But i have [exhales] i have no air in my lungs. [ breathes deeply ] [ sniffs ] And i look at her, And i know that i'll be dead soon, too. [ coughs ] I'll get you some more blankets. What was the name of the, uh, building That you were demolishing? [ sniffs ] rose park apartments. Jack: tom? jack gallagher. Hi. quick question for you -- What was the name of the apartment building That you were tearing down when billy got hurt? Uh-huh. No, that's it. that's great. i appreciate it. Thanks, tom. [ beep ] Veronica: no one died or was harmed in any way. The patient was seen by another doctor within minutes. It's not that bad. I denied an injured man treatment. Yeah, but at the hearing, You just say that you felt sick And you had to leave the room. That's a lie. Well, under the circumstances... Look [exhales] No one gives us the right to make moral judgments As to who we help and who we don't. Okay. so, no excuses. you snapped. In that moment, you snapped. You -- you say you're sorry, it'll never happen again, And you accept whatever penalty the committee recommends, And you get past this. I'll be under a microscope. Yeah, for a while. I wanted him to die. Ohh. Why do we need this grief? [ chuckles ] Either of us. What a you talking about? Maybe it's time for a change. I've been thinking about moving back to austin. I want you to come with me. Well, you know i can't. i know... You're unhappy in your marriage. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here, naked in bed with me. Oh, jesus. you'd love austin. There's the university med center. And with your credentials -- There is no shortageof crazi And you really think emergency medicine's Gonna be any different, There's no ugliness, no violence there? [ scoffs ] come on, rylan. We'd be together. [ chuckles lightly ] I just can't just pack up and...leave. You can. it's so simple. You pack a bag, get on a plane. What are you really leaving behind? [ knock on door ] Professor vilchek? Dr. gallagher! Close the door. maybe we'll start a rumor. [ chuckles ] the rose park mine disaster -- why come to me?</i> Wrote the book, professor. a book, one of a dozen or so on the subject,</i> And hardly the most notable. Well, you're the only one i found here in l.a. Fate. [ chuckles ] i believe in fate. do you? Actually, no. Well, you're still a young man. consider, then, the fate Of the 263 coal miners Who descended into shaft number 3 Of the rose park mine on a frozen january 11, 1903, Never to emerge. So what went wrong? Fire. They used mules down in the pits in those days To pull the coal carts. Mules need hay. some fool parked a hay cart under an open torch?</i> Kerosene and coal dust are latile mixture, And they felt that explosion eight miles away. It was one of the worst mining disasters in u.s. history. Those who managed to survive the initial fire, explosion, And tunnel collapse Were overcome by the black damp. Poison air? but there were survivors. 16. 15 of them had just gotten off the elevator hoist And were hauled up to safety. the other one wasn't so lucky --</i> Trapped for six grueling days. The searchers had given up looking for survivors, And they were just bringing up bodies, And they found him surrounded By nine friends and co-workers. They barricaded themselves into a side tunnel. The black damp had taken the rest of them. Far right. billy: and i see myself in the reflection,</i> only...it's not me -- older, dirtier. i have a bandage over my eye. for me? Signed by the author. [ book claps shut ] That's what i admire about you, gallagher -- You go the extra mile. I-i was content to do my research online. And not share what you've learned with your colleagues? You step in on my patient without my permission, you pay the freight. And i was curious to see How long it would take you to catch on. Past-life memory? Not the first thing that comes to mind -- not my mind, anyway. So, what explanation will it be for mr. bauer -- That he's experiencing symptoms From an event he only dreams of? Reincarnation and the transmigration of souls, Jung's collective unconscious, Or those millions of tiny units of information Mysteriously buried in our dna And passed down through generations? I can't explain it. so i won't try. But billy's got a right to know what i've uncovered, Whatever it means. Maybe you should talk to somebody Better versed in the area. How do you know her? [ pen thuds lightly ] Love the new laptop. Woman: great class. [ chuckles ] Bye! Louisa: see ya! Bye-bye. Woman #2: hey, guys, wait up. [ birds chirping ] Dr. gallagher? It's very good of you to see me. thank you. Just so i'm clear, uh, this really isn't about you? A patient. Mm. Some people come to me Pretending to be someone other than themselves. They do, huh? why? Well, past-life regression is hardly a mainstream belief. you're a believer. As were and are many cultures, both modern and primitive, Not to mention hundreds of documented cases, Some chronicled by people in your own profession. I'm familiar with the studies. [ chuckles ] But you don't believe. These regressions -- how do you perform them? Well, i don't use drugs or hocus-pocus, If that's what you mean. The subject must be willing, And with my help they enter into a meditative state And begin the journey of self. I act as guide. And what do they get from the experience? Hopefully release. If you're scared of elephants and can't imagine why, It might be helpful to know That you were once trampled by one, Perhaps as a member Of hannibal's army crossing the alps. You aren't scared of elephants, are you? unh-unh. I need some general information. So, you're a friend of carl belle's. We work together. A very old soul, With a very interesting lineage. [ knock on door ] What happened at the hearing? Sit down. [ clears throat ] Well, um, it's over. Oh, my god, they fired him. No. A couple of hospital lawyers Went in to take a statement From the patient, But he was so high when they brought him in That he didn't remember anything. So a decision was made to let the whole thing die. [ chuckles ] that's fantastic. does rylan know? Yeah, of course. What? Well, he thanked the committee And tendered his resignation. What? Where are we going? We're heading for the basement. I don't want to. Let's just go back to the hospital. Ask me what's down here. Ask me. What's -- what's down here? Whatever it is that you're afraid of. [ plank thuds ] Four months ago, An air shaft opened up right here, And you fell in. But something else happened. [ indistinct shouting ] What was the name of the building That you were demolishing? Rose park apartments. Wait. [ indistinct shouting ] Park view apartments. Where did you see the words "rose park"? [ indistinct shouting ] What's g-- what's going on here? Okay. look at this. Who is he? [ grunting ] I don't know. I-i can't make him out. You've seen him before -- in your dreams, billy. [ indistinct voices ] Then who is he?! His name is dwayne jenkins. Dwayne jenkins was you in a past life. [ exhales ] that's -- that's not possible. Just get me out of here right now. There's an explanation. i don't care what the explan-- i think you do care, billy!</i> I think you're damn tired of being buried alive. Now, what do you remember? We were working when it happened. Bodies were everywhere, trapped. And i, uh... ...i was gone. So, dwayne jenkins died in a mine collapse, And 100 years later, I fall into a hole, and i remember being him. Heat from the fire and explosion, The cold and darkness that followed, Painful wounds to the back of his leg, Air choked with coal dust, The terror of imminent death... ...jenkins' life... Not your own. I think it's the confusion of memories past and present And the fear that that brings That's causing your symptoms. This past-life regression will help? Well, hopefully by examining them in detail and in context, We can separate jenkins' memories from your own So you can stop living his fears in your life. I think you'll get better. and i think you will build things.</i> I think i'm ready to go back now. There's one more thing. When you were trapped and down in the hole, You looked up, and you saw the face of annie. When jenkins was also trapped, he looked up, likewise, and saw the face of his annie.</i> But if jenkins died in the pit, how could he have -- Dwayne jenkins was the last survivor Of the rose park mine disaster. [ coughing ] When they brought him to the surface six days later, His wife, ella, was waiting for him. They lived together for 30 years, And they raised a family. now, as you were dwayne jenkins,</i> Annie was ella. Billy. [ exhales ] That's a lot to take in. I know. you have time. There's a condition called nystagmus That only affects miners. When they spend too long underground, Their eyes lose the ability to detect light. And annie? Well, there's a theory Among believers in reincarnation That, um, some souls can choose to, uh, travel together Through the generations. Romantic. uh-huh. And so now you're a believer. Hell no. But you referred him to this woman, louisa, For a series of past-life regressions? it's not what i believe. it's what billy believes.</i> His vision's already started to clear, by the way. Well, i tend to believe in miracles. [ exhales ] Yeah. indeed. Hey, wouldn't it be nice If all our, uh, shortcomin and indiscretions Could be corrected in another life? You mean like a do-over? [ laughs ] Yeah, that'd be great. [ laughs ] [ scanner beeps ] Carl. Jack. Louisa knox tells me you're a very old soul. She would know. [ chuckles ] When did you first suspect billy was mixing up Past- and present-life memories? After i talked to hearst. And during the intake, In describing the construction accident, Billy said that he thought he was clear of the pit. It's a mining term. Ah. i should have picked up on that. Ah. you should have. But you obviously do believe. Here's what i don't get -- You let me stumble around the truth, While u were denying it the whole time. Only a practitioner with no regard for his career Would go on record for having treated a patient for past-life trauma. [ chuckles ] Kind of thing could come back and bite you in the ass. That's good advice. [ chuckles ] You should listen to me more, jack. You ever again withhold information That's relevant to the care of a patient on this ward, And either you or i will be out. Louisa also mentioned something about lineage. Oh ho ho, no! [ both laugh ] Ready to go? Yep. He called about an hour ago. You were right. I needed to be ready to listen. What did he say? "keep up the good work." Congratulations. he did leave a message for you.</i> for me? [ chuckles ] well, what -- what was it? "stay tuned. Big changes are comin'." You won't reconsider? Quitting felt too right. Uh... Just so you know, if we'd never met Or, uh, gotten involved, I'd be doing the exact same thing. It's time to go home. Well, you knew what my answer would be. I was pretty sure. Hey. Yocan't feel like you're the one being rejected here. You know where to find me. [ door opens ] [ door closes ] [ doorbell buzzing ] [ exhales sharply ] Rebecca? Mm. [ moans softly [ exhales sharply ] [ moans softly ] Rebecca? Mm. It's gonna be okay.
