I sent them home. What do you mean you sent them home? Do you know how much ass-Kissing I had to do to get the board to approve repainting the psych ward? No, but I'm sure you're about to tell me. A lot, you have no idea what I have to deal with - Inane questions like, "Do mentally ill people Really notice the color of the walls?" They're mentally ill. They're not blind. Not to mention that I got it on the cheap From a friend of a friend. You can still pay them... if you like. You know, I know that you think This is your personal playground, But it's a bureaucracy. It's a corporation. It's a hospital. I have to answer to a board. Yeah? Can you hold these for a second? Hi. I'm dr. Jack Gallagher. Oh. Thank you, doctor. Um... they said it was gonna be an hour or so wait. Uh-Huh. Well, let's see if we can't cut in line. What's your name? Um, his name's Conor. He's 8. Uh, he was in the kitchen Making himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, And the knife slipped. He's usually very talkative. He's just - He's upset. Sure. Sure. Understandable. He's... obsessed with video games. Uh-Huh. Why don't you guys come with me? Come on. Hey, Conor. I'm dr. Moore. Heard you had a little accident, huh? You're his mother? Yeah. Dania Stephens. Uh, my - My husband, Ian, is on his way. Mind if I take a look? Well, that's not too bad. Nothing a couple stitches isn't gonna cure. Conor, can you tell me if it hurts anywhere else? Conor, my buddy Ryan here wants to help you. But you need to help us, too, okay? He's a smart guy, but he's no mind reader. Mrs. Stephens, I'm gonna give Conor A quick physical examination, If you'll kindly step outside. But it's - It's just a cut. There's nothing wrong with him. Standard operating procedure. Conor, Ryan’s not gonna hurt you, okay? He's just gonna listen to your heart and lungs, Make sure everything's okay. I'll be right outside, honey. I'll be right back. How's it going? Well... David hasn't done anything But sit in his chair and cry since he got here two days ago. Now look at him. look at that! Hmm. You have an opinion, doctor. I just don't think this falls Under the category of "treatment. " Mainly therapy. Patients become agents in their environment, Rather than just passive participants. Beautifying and reshaping their surroundings Gives them a pride of ownership, Makes them more invested in themselves. But if you disagree, I'd be happy to see some research on the subject. Great, have it on my desk first thing tomorrow morning. you know, I'm usually the first To balk at any change in routine, But this does appear to be working. Where are you going? To pay off the painters. Just give me one deep breath, Conor. Mrs. Stephens, I haven't finished my examination. Could you please wait outside? I'm sorry, I just really don't want to leave Conor alone. I don't think I introduced myself properly before. I'm the director of psychiatric services. I'd like to do an evaluation of your son. What the hell for? Oh, Ian, I'm so glad you're here. What's the problem? Just stitch him up. He's a little boy, and he's had an accident. And he's not talking Because you're scaring the hell out of him. He's not talking because he's internally preoccupied. Honey, what's the name Of the woman you know here at the hospital? Um, Nora Skoff. I want her down here in five minutes, Or I'm gonna take my son somewhere else. Mr. Stephens, I'd really like The opportunity to talk to Conor. We're leaving. Come on, Conor. Let's go, buddy. Let's go. Conor! Conor! Conor, what's wrong?! Hey, what's the matter?! How is she? Fine. Superficial knife wound. She tried to bandage it herself. But, uh, she needed a couple stitches. She say anything else about what happened? New story. Conor was making a sandwich, cut himself, The knife went flying, and she got cut, too. if that's the truth, Why didn't she say so in the first place? How's Conor? Malcolm's keeping an eye on him. He still hasn't said a word. Dr. Segal to the pharmacy. Dr. Segal to the pharmacy.</i> Maria, what are you doing here? Go home. No. I have to tell someone. I have to tell someone what happened. Mrs. Stephens, she say it was an accident, But it was not an accident. Where's Nora Skoff? I've called her. As soon as she gets in, I'm sure she'll be happy to talk to you. There's no way I'm allowing my son To be admitted to a psychiatric ward. do you know who he is? His company, Stephens industrial, Has factories all over the world. Your point, Carl? I know the Stephens’s. Maybe I can mediate. Be my guest. Mr. Stephens. Dr. Carl belle. Uh, we've met before, actually. My wife and I have a box next to yours - The Hollywood bowl. Good. Then maybe you can tell me Why this hospital is forcing my son to stay here. Let me get into it. And if it turns out that your son Is gonna be staying with us for a few days, I will personally oversee his case. Here's my card. My home and cell number are on the back. Um, of course, as director of psychiatric services, Dr. Gallagher will be on hand to observe. Conor. Conor? We're gonna get to know each other really well. Malcolm, uh, let's show the Stephens’s to my office. We'll do the rest of the paperwork in private, shall we? yes, sir. Becky? Hold on a second. Don't hang up. I'm really glad you've called. I haven't heard from you in a while. I was, uh... y - You had me a little worried. You okay? I'm starting to settle in here... a bit. The truth is, I wasn't sure I'd last a week. Can you imagine - Me, the boss? I've made a few changes. Quite a lot of changes. I reckon there's some people around here Who think I'm the one who's crazy. Becky? Becky, what's that? That's church bells, right? Where are you - Somewhere downtown? Beck? Dania, Ian, how are you? How the hell do you think we're doing? As well as can be expected, I suppose, Under the circumstances. I'm very sorry for what you're going through. We're not going through anything... except dealing with a couple of trigger- Happy shrinks Who want to keep Conor here. There's nothing wrong with our boy. we just want to take Conor home. This hospital has no right to keep him here Against our wishes. I just got off the phone with the detective Who interviewed the housekeeper, Maria. The facts, as I know them now, is that Conor Picked up a kitchen knife and was about to stab himself When Dania rushed in and grabbed the knife And, in the process, injured herself. She's lying. Under the California code 5150, We absolutely do have the right and the responsibility To keep Conor here for 72 hours if we believe That he may be in danger to himself or to anybody else. Regretfully, we will exercise that right. You'll hear from my attorney. Hey, mom! Hi. Wow. I didn't expe - Expect you already. Dad and Chelsea decided to leave on the camping trip early. Huh. And you didn't want to go. Yeah, because you know how much I love dirt And bugs and no showers. Besides, I wanted to get some stuff at the mall, anyway. Oh, great. Well, we can go later. Um, actually, I was planning ongoing with Mia. Can I have some money? I would like to spend some time with you this visit. Sure. Whatever. Jack, no, it's okay. This is my daughter, Ainsley. Hi, Ainsley. Hi. Uh, Nora tells me you're in high school. Yeah. How old are you, anyway? I, uh... I just popped in To see how it went with the Stephenses. They're in denial and not very happy, As you probably figured out already. Okay. Nice to meet you, Ainsley. Bye. He is so hot. Yes. Hey, dr. Belle. You ready for us? You can leave him here. Just wait outside, Malcolm. Hey, Conor. Sit down. You guys all right in here? We'll be just fine. You don't have to sit down if you don't want to. This is what is called, uh, an intake interview. This is where I ask you questions, And, uh, hopefully, you' answer. It's a chance for me To figure out what's upsetting you. Oh! You like that one? You have good taste. You believe that vase is over 600 years old? Conor, let's talk about what happened in the kitchen. I know you're a smart little boy. I know you remember. Are you mad at your mother? Hey, Malcolm! Aah! I - Aah! Hey, don't just sit there! Something! I am, Carl. I'm observing. I'm hungry. Can I please have a tuna sandwich? He's a little sociopath in the making. Anything constructive? Well, because he seemed to be in his own world, Selectively mute, I thought at first maybe autism, Asperger's, But, what, now that he's talking - Obviously huge mood swings. Seems elated, curious, then he rages with no trigger. I think we're seeing early-Onset bipolar. Agreed. Agreed. Definitely manic. We need to start him on, uh, antipsychotics immediately - Risperdal, depakote, lithium bicarbonate. He's only 8 - We don't even know What bipolar looks like in kids. He scored a 7 out of 8 on the DSM-IV checklist. We know. 50% of kids who are thought to have A mental illness today are labelled "bipolar. " It's absurd. It could just be that there's increased recognition now. Bipolar disorder is the diagnosis du jour. You know the parents - How is it possible That they haven't noticed There's something terribly wrong with their child? It's impossible. Dania must have noticed, but for some reason, She's afraid to tell her husband. He could just be severely ADHD. Good point. Please prepare a paper on the current thinking Of bipolar disorder presenting in children Under the age of 10. I-I believe that we need to start him On 5 milligrams of Risperdal Combined with another 5 milligrams of depakote. We may have a legal problem with that. They're about to file a writ of habeas corpus. that leaves us with psychotherapy. All things considered, Carl, Maybe I should take the lead on this. Hey, there's no ego here. You go ahead. I think I'll get to know Conor a little better. I suggest not doing it in your office. Why did you bring me here? I like it here. How come? The kids - They're all happy. They're all having fun. Are you happy? I'm mostly happy. Everybody has some things that, uh - That they don't like. Jump up. What are your things? Well... my sister's sick. And that's not so good. And I'm not climbing in the mountains 'Cause I'm here in the city, And, uh, that doesn't make me too happy. What makes you happy? I used to play video games... a lot. Then my dad said I was addicted, and he took them all away. That make you upset? I guess. I was happy. When I was younger, my dad - He'd take me to his factory. It was kind of like our place. It's really cool. Then... he stopped taking me to work. I hear them talking sometimes. He says I'm not normal. What's wrong with me? You're just... you're just sort of wired A little bit differently than most of us. There's a lot of really, really smart people That are wired a little bit differently. Like who? Well, like, uh... Beethoven, Isaac Newton... Vincent van Gogh... ...Robert Downey Jr. Iron man. Really? Yeah. Cool. Do you remember what you were thinking When you picked up the knife in the kitchen? Yeah. I was thinking that I was broken, Like some of my old video games. I was thinking that I needed to be thrown out. Is that what you're doing with your fingers - You're playing your old video games? I play a new one now... one I made up. I started playing it in my head. I have to get away from the demons. I'm trying to run away but... ...they keep coming after me. So, what's the object of the game? Where are you running to? A safe place. I haven't made it there yet. Conor's not bipolar. He can't be. That's inherited, isn't it? Bipolar is highly genetic. 80% of kids diagnosed with bipolar Have parents with a history of mood disorders. Well, there you have it. There is no history of mental illness In either of our families. He's perfectly normal. Dania, why are you home-schooling him? Look, I'm not saying that Conor’s not a special kid. He is, but in a good way. Maybe he can't handle the pressures of a large classroom. But at home, with me and his tutors, He's testing way above grade average. Stop. We don't have to explain ourselves to you. No, but you can't ignore the symptoms - Distractibility, hyperactivity, explosive rages, Separation anxiety, mood swings, depression, low self-Esteem. Did it ever occur to you people That this might just be a phase he's going through? Show me a kid who doesn't throw a tantrum. And everyone gets depressed now and then. Yeah. And how many 8-Year-Old kids consider suicide? He was just... playing. Are you willing to bet his life on that? If you're refusing To let us start him on a course of medication, Please let us do a brain scan. Actually, they've just done Some extraordinary research pointing out - Conor doesn't need a brain scan. He needs to come home. Mr. Stephens, how much time Have you spent with your son lately? What? It's understandable, what, with your schedule. Have you been around long enough to even notice that he's - How dare you. You've been treating my son for, what, a couple of hours? This is my son! I was there when he was born. I rocked him to sleep every night, read him stories... Ian, please... took him to the ball game, Taught him how to tie his shoes! I did everything - Everything that a father is supposed to do with his son! "Did" - In the past. What about now? Let's go. Ainsley. Mom, can you please knock before you come in? W- Why? What are you - What are you doing That I'm not supposed to see? I need privacy. Look, I know I don't live here anymore. But it's still my room, isn't it? Yeah, I-I just wanted to tell you That dinner will be ready in an hour. Okay. I'm gonna go for a jog. I'll be back. Bye. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Okay, I'm gonna let you go, all right? What happened? we were just shooting hoops. He started getting angry Because he wasn't making any baskets. I told him it was okay, But he just kept saying over and over That he was stupid. He started hitting, and I just... okay. Give us a minute. Hey, Conor. What's going on? I'm so dumb. I can't do anything right. Hey, everybody's got a temper. You, too? Oh, yeah. Big time. We just need to find a way for you to control it. I can't. Once it starts... I can't stop. Okay. Come here. Then we need to find something for you to concentrate on Whenever you start to feel that anger take over. Here's what we're gonna do - How about you play your video game? Only this time, we're gonna give you some upgrades, okay? What are you wearing in the game? T - Shirt and jeans. Kind of like this? Yeah. And are you carrying anything? Like, maybe a backpack? No. Well, let's say you are. Why? 'Cause then we can put some stuff in it. Cool. What's up? The attorney for the Stephenses called. Maria, the nanny, recanted. Oh, what a shocker. They probably threatened her With deportation. Anyway, they got a judge to sign the writ. And after the 72-Hour hold, we have to set Conor free. Damn it, Nora. I'm making progress. If I even had two weeks with this kid, I could sort him out. W - We have no legal standing. So what? We just wait around until he hurts someone or himself? Convince his parents. You okay? I'm fine. Actually, I'm not fine. I - I need some advice. What am I - Chopped liver? She didn't try to hide it? She didn't think I'd snoop. I've never done that before. You hear all this stuff About kids and predators on the internet. I think she wanted you to find it. It's like the rich kid Who steals a pair of sunglasses and gets caught. How did she handle the divorce? She says she understood. In fact, she was the only girl in her clique Whose parents were still married. But... I was sick. Sick? What do you mean "sick"? Uh, well, I had cancer. Myeloma. I'm in complete remission now. Nora, why didn't you tell me? Before I hired you, The subject just... didn't come up. Fine. So you got sick, you got treatment, And you filed for divorce. I was in the hospital, being treated with chemo, And I thought, While they're zapping all those cancer cells, I would get rid of everything else in my life That was unhealthy, including my marriage. And Ainsley was there through it all. I tried to shelter her from it. She's such a beautiful girl And she's very good in school and... and she's very popular. That's how you see her. How does she see herself? Ian, hey, how are you? Hope you don't mind. No. You gave me your card. No, no, no, no. Of course not. Glad you came. Please, have a seat. Uh, have you seen Conor today? I'm waiting for Dania. Speaking of which, my wife and I... would love to have the two of you over for dinner. I have this beautiful Lafitte. This is after Conor’s been released And back home, of course. Actually, this whole thing's Been pretty tough on Dania and me. I don't think we're gonna be socializing anytime soon. Oh, no. Of course. Of course not. You know... in my business, If there's a problem, I fix it. But this... Conor will improve. I wish I could say the same thing for me and Dania. How does this happen? You're going along, day after day, Thinking everything's fine, then out of nowhere - Ian, I don't think that this is out of nowhere. Listen, I-I'm just gonna be honest with you. I - I think that you need to sit down And have a very straightforward conversation with Dania. This condition - This manic depression, this bipolarism... doesn't just come on overnight. You're absolutely right, doctor. remember, doc, we got to make this quick. Thanks, Jesus. You're welcome. You got my tickets? Ah, come on, man - Floor seats. My man. Hey. Thanks, Malc. Ah, no problem, doc. I owe you one. How you doing, little bro? I'm scared. Y don't you close your eyes and play the game? It'll take your mind off it. Okay. I'll be waiting right over here. Good boy. You're doing great, Conor. Just relax. Conor, are you okay? Are you playing the game? Do you remember the backpack we talked about? Look for it. It'll be there. Put it on. I know it's a little bit scary. I can't. I can't! How long for the readout? Um... I don't know, about a day or so. Any chance we can rush it? You like the clippers? Any other presentations, theses, papers you want written? Not at the moment. Hold on a second. Conor, Malcolm will take you back up. I'll come up and play the game later, okay? Okay. Jack? Mm-Hmm. If that machine I was in finds something wrong with my brain, Can I get a new one? We can't give you a new one, Conor. But you know what? We can make the one you've got work a lot better. But I don't want to be like this anymore. Trust me. We're gonna make it right. Thanks, Malcolm. At ease, soldier. Feel free to speak your mind. Fine. Get off my ass. You take every opportunity to test me, to pile work on me. Why? Because I don't know why you're here. Most of the time I just feel like you're phoning it in. What, were all the dermatology residencies filled? Are you just biding your time until one opens up? Is it because I don't always agree with you? It's because when you disagree, you don't fight for it. If we're not gonna fight for these patients, who is? I'm a good doctor. I do everything that's asked of me here. It's not enough. Look, I get it. Psychiatry's different. It's not like we get the immediate gratification Of mending a broken bone or... or performing a successful lung transplant Or even cutting away 20 years' worth of wrinkles. Hell, it's rare that we actually ever cure anyone. But even so, You have to find the enthusiasm to stay in the game. I'll get my pom-poms out of storage. Psychiatry's a calling. I'm not convinced you've got it. Tell me about those pom-pom things. Hey. What are you doing home so early? That's my computer. You have no right - Is this the way you see yourself? This is lame. I'm - I'm out of here. I'm - I'd rather be at dad's. Than what - Have an honest conversation with me? You're gonna talk to me about being honest? You had cancer, and you almost died, But you wouldn't even let me in the hospital. I didn't want you to have to see me that way. You're my mother. You should have known that I could handle it And not shut me out and shuttle me off to dad's. I'm like... totally alone. I have no family right now. I - I come here, and you want to hang out like my b. F.F. And I go to dad's, and all he cares about Is his hottie and her two psycho kids. I made a mistake. I should have talked to you about my illness, And I should have included you in my recovery. I never meant to hurt you. I love you more than anything. Attention, security. We have a missing child. Answers to the name of Conor. Security, a missing child. What the hell's going on? Conor's gone. What? I was taking him back to the ward, But he said he had to pee really bad. So I took him to the men's room in the lobby. I was waiting outside. He must have snuck out. They searched the whole hospital. Now they're combing the streets. Ian, uh... I'm so sorry. There's something I need to tell you... something even Dania doesn't know. Who was it? My mother. She was committed to a mental institution When I was 16. I remember my sister and I would come home from school, And sometimes my dad wouldn't let us into the house for hours Because my mom was having one of her... fits. Ian, I know what it's like To have mental illness in your family. Conor's a great kid. He's got a chance to have a really happy life. What did he say to me? He said... he said the happiest time in his life Was with you at one of your, uh... one of your factories. Is there one nearby? Yes. You go that way? Conor! Conor! Conor, please answer me! Conor, are you here?! Conor, it's daddy! Please tell me if you're in here! Conor! Conor! Conor, look in your backpack! It's got everything you need to win! Conor, wait! Finish it, Conor! Ooh! Ugh! I did it, jack! I won the game! That's great, Conor. That's just great. I'm here, son. this is a normal brain, and this is Conor’s brain. My god. Now, these scans aren't 100% accurate, But these results In combination with the symptoms he's presenting... listen, if Conor was diabetic, wouldn't you give him insulin? He needs medication. It might take us a little time To find out the right mix, but... okay. We'll start right away. Is there anything else I can do? Actually, you might try tickling him. Scientists have been testing rats And recording the high-Pitch sounds they make When they're being tickled. They're actually laughing. It's gonna be okay, Dania. Is this, uh, a I - A lifelong thing? I mean, will he get better? Ere is no cure... as such. But medication can and will help. I - I need some time. Dania. Dania, where are you going? I'll call you. It's a lot for her to take in. Hey, hey. Hi. Guess what. It's time to go home. You mean we can't play the game anymore? You know what? Maybe someday a lot of people will play your game, Maybe millions of people. If you can create it in your head, You can create it on paper. Cool. I think you can do anything you set your mind to. Where's mom? We'll see her later. Okay. Thanks for the cards. You're welcome. Thank you. I'll see you soon. Hey, hey. You, uh... so, are you sticking around for a while? Maybe. Well, I hope so. And where are you ladies off to? Dinner. You want to come? Um... I'd love to, but, uh, maybe another time. Have fun, though. He is so hot. I know. I know. Mom! No, I know!
