THAT, UM, GIRL THAT YOU LIVED WITH -- WERE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER? DEPENDS. DO YOU DEFINE "LOVE" BY HOW GOOD YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A RELATIONSHIP OR HOW BAD YOU FEEL WHEN IT ENDS? OKAY, WELL, HOW'D YOU FEEL WHEN IT ENDED? IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. SO, WHEN YOUR MOM ASKED IF YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH ME, WHAT DID YOU SAY? OH, I TOLD HER IT WAS TOO SOON TO TELL...

I'M FINE. SURE. DOC, I'M ASSUMING SHE'S IN SHOCK. I DON'T THINK SO. WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I MEAN, THE WAY WE'RE FIGURING, THE VICTIM, WHO THE APARTMENT MANAGER SAYS IS HER FATHER, WAS SHOT RIGHT HERE TWICE AT CLOSE RANGE. THERE'S NO WAY SHE DIDN'T WITNESS THE WHOLE THING. I DON'T THINK IT'S SHOCK. I THINK SHE'S AUTISTIC. YOU MEAN LIKE RAIN MAN? SHE SEES THE WHOLE THING GO DOWN, BUT SHE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT? WELL, HER VERBAL SKILLS ARE PRETTY GOOD, ACTUALLY, BUT SHE'S ECHOLALIC. SHE REPEATS BACK A LOT OF WHAT IS SAID TO HER. AND EVEN THOUGH THE MURDER TOOK PLACE RIGHT HERE, UM, SHE MAY NOT APPRECIATE WHAT HAPPENED. Bagdonis: I KNEW IT. I, UH, GOT A NEPHEW WHO'S AUTISTIC. THAT'S JUST MY LUCK. I GOT AN EYEWITNESS TO A MURDER, IT HAPPENS RIGHT SMACK IN FRONT OF HER, AND SHE'S GONNA BE THE WORST WITNESS ON THE PLANET. WITH RESPECT, LIEUTENANT, IF THAT MAN'S HER FATHER, UH, BEING A WITNESS ISN'T, UM... ISN'T REALLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. AH, BUT... I'M SORRY. HEY, CAN I, UH -- CAN I GET SOME OF HER THINGS TO BRING TO THE HOSPITAL? YEAH, WE'LL HAVE SOMEBODY BRING THEM DOWN WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE. LEEZA? I'D LIKE TO GO NOW. I'D LIKE TO GO NOW.

A KID ON THE LOWER END OF THE AUTISTIC SPECTRUM -- THEY WOULDN'T EVEN NOTICE. SEE WHAT SHE'S DOING NOW? PROBABLY FINDS THAT SOOTHING. [ SCREAMING ] IT'S OKAY. IT'S A TACTILE THING. SHE PROBABLY CAN'T STAND THE FEELING OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT ON HER SKIN. LET'S TRY SOMETHING OF HERS. Jack: ANY MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FATHER? AH, NOT MUCH. HE WAS A SMALL-TIME DRUG USER, DEALER, HAD SEVERAL ALIASES. A BUNCH OF FAKE I.D.s ON HIM. LET'S TURN THE P.A. SYSTEM OFF IN HERE, AS WELL AS THE LIGHTS. Nurse: YES. OVERLOAD FOR HER.ENSORY ARE AMPLIFIED, ARE PROBABLY BLINDING. IT PROBABLY WENT DOWN SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR, DADDY GOES TO THE WINDOW, SEES WHO IT IS, FIGURES HE'S IN DEEP DOO-DOO, YOU KNOW, TAKES LEEZA, PUTS HER IN THE CLOSET, OPENS THE DOOR -- BANG, BANG -- HE'S DEAD. ANY LEADS AS TO WHO -- PULLED THE TRIGGER? NO. BUT WE'RE PRETTY SURE A GUY NAMED DAMON PREESE IS BEHIND IT. MAJOR SUPPLIER, SOUTH CENTRAL -- RUTHLESS. DO YOU THINK THAT HE COULD HAVE HAD HER IN A DAY-CARE CLINIC OR SCHOOL OR -- WE'RE ALREADY ON THAT. I KNOW THIS IS TOUGH, DOC, BUT DO YOU THINK MAYBE YOU COULD GET HER TO OPEN UP A LITTLE BIT MORE SO WE COULD ASK HER SOME MORE QUESTIONS? HEY, IT'S POSSIBLE, AND, UH, I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP. PROMISE. BUT YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT MY PRIORITY'S GONNA HAVE TO BE LEEZA. IT'S NOT THE BAD GUY. WELL, CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES WILL BE HERE TO FILE THEIR REPORT AND START THE PAPERWORK. BUT, N-- SHE'S ONLY JUST ARRIVED. YOU CAN'T -- STANDARD PROCEDURE. WITH HER FATHER GONE? NOT IF WE FIND ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER, THOUGH, RIGHT? DO YOU KNOW SHE'S TWIRLING? I THINK SHE'S REGRESSED. WE'D NEED TO HAVE HER HERE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER JUST TO ESTABLISH THE STATE OF HER MENTAL ESTRAN-- BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID SHE COULDN'T APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT HER FATHER WAS SHOT. YEAH. I-I MAY HAVE BEEN WRONG IN THAT. Truitt: [ CHUCKLES ] SO YOU THINK SHE NEEDS TO STAY HERE A LITTLE LONGER. THAT WOULD BE GOOD. OKAY, THEN. THANKS, DOC. LET'S GO. Bagdonis: CALL US IF ANYTHING CHANGES. OKAY. [ DOOR OPENS ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] REGRESSED? YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT, DO YOU? I KNOW SHE HASN'T REGRESSED. WE CAN'T JUST DUMP HER IN THE SYSTEM. NO, WE CAN'T. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HER OR WHO MISSES HER. I GUESS LEEZA'S GONNA HAVE TO TELL US. SECURITY TO FLOOR 2. Woman: [ CHUCKLING ] WE'RE BIG FANS. IN FACT, YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIM AROUND. DAD. HEY. ARTURO. [ GRUNTS, CHUCKLES ] [ CLAPPING BACK ] SO, UH... HOW WAS YOUR TRIP? AHH... NO SUCH THING AS FIRST CLASS ANYMORE. SO I HEAR. I MEAN, I REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN THEY USED TO ROLL THE CART RIGHT UP NEXT TO YOUR CHAIR AND POUR WINE INTO A REAL GLASS. THEY USED TO SLICE THE PRIME RIB RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. THE STEWARDESSES NOW -- NOT EVEN THAT PRETTY. NO, I THINK THEY'RE CALLED FLIGHT ATTENDANTS NOW, DAD. DID YOU GO TO THE HOTEL YET? NO, NO, I CAME STRAIGHT HERE. WELL, I HAVE ROUNDS TO DO BEFORE WE CAN EVEN... PERFECT, 'CAUSE I'M DYING TO SEE YOUR NEW STOMPING GROUNDS. WELL, IT'S A LOCKED WARD. I -- WELL, THEY'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION. AFTER ALL, I AM A DOCTOR, TOO. Woman: BYE. Woman #2: BYE. WHAT IS IT, LEEZA? WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO SAY? WANT TO SAY. YEAH, CAN YOU -- CAN YOU USE THIS TO TYPE IN THE WORDS THAT YOU WANT TO SAY? TYPE IN THE WORDS. Female computerized voice: I...</i> NEED... ...PUZZLE. BEAUTIFUL, LEEZA. WE UNDERSTAND. YOU CAN'T FINISH THE PUZZLE WITHOUT THE MISSING PIECE. "I NEED PUZZLE." I NEED...PUZZLE. MM-HMM. I WONDER HOW MUCH USE WE CAN GET OUT OF THAT THING. WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF WORDS IN THERE. RECKON SHE CAN TELL US ANYTHING MORE ABOUT HER FATHER? LEEZA, CAN YOU TELL US THE NAME OF YOUR FATHER? DAD. [ LAUGHS ] [ Laughing ] OH, MY GOD. SMARTER THAN US. YEAH. HEY. UH, W-WHERE DID YOU GET THAT PIANO? NEVER MIND. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. Woman on P.A.: LAB TECH, 200, STAT.</i> LAB TECH, 200, STAT. SO, WE'RE HAVING A CONCERT? I HOPE SO. [ MAJOR SCALE PLAYS ] [ DING! ] [ MAJOR SCALE PLAYING ON PIANO ] SHE'S STILL AT IT. 48 MINUTES. I MEAN, I'VE TIMED IT. MY HEAD IS POUNDING. MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD. HOW SO? OH, I TOOK LESSONS AS A KID.

Jack: THANK YOU. [ LAUGHS ] I HEAR YOUR FATHER'S IN TOWN. I'D LIKE TO MEET HIM. OKAY, I JUST FINISHED MEETING WITH CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES, AND THEY'RE READY TO PLACE LEEZA -- PLACE HER WHERE -- GROUP HOME, FOSTER CARE? LIEUTENANT TRUITT IS DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO FIND HER FAMILY, JACK, BUT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HER FATHER'S REAL LAST NAME. WE CAN'T KEEP HER HERE INDEFINITELY. YEAH, I KNOW. WE DO NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE HER FAMILY IS. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, GUYS? CLOCK'S TICKING. I DID THE RESEARCH YOU REQUESTED ON CUTTING-EDGE AUTISM TREATMENTS. THE GOLDEN STANDARD IS STILL APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. A.B.A. USES THE STANDARD REINFORCE -- PRAISE, TOYS -- TO REWARD AND INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF THE DESIRED RESPONSE. Veronica: I THOUGHT WE COULD ALTER HER DIET, GIVE HER SOME B6 WITH MAGNESIUM SUPPLEMENTS. THAT'S BEEN KNOWN TO INCREASE GENERAL WELL-BEING, ATTENTION, AWARENESS IN -- IN ALMOST HALF AUTISTIC KIDS. THERE ARE SOME OTHER WACKY TREATMENTS, AS WELL. GO FOR IT. UM, VESTIBULAR STIMULATION. THERE'S A GUY IN WESTCHESTER THAT USES DISORIENTING GOGGLES. ANOTHER PUTS KIDS ON BALANCE BEAMS, EXPOSURE TO PARASITES, CHELATION THERAPY, HYPERBARIC OXYGEN TREATMENTS. PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING TO STOP THE EPIDEMIC. YOU KNOW, 20 YEARS AGO, THERE WAS ONE IN 10,000 KIDS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. NOW IT'S ONE IN 150. WHAT DO WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH WHILE SHE'S HERE? WE CAN'T REALISTICALLY EXPECT HER TO START COMMUNICATING BETTER IN A MATTER OF DAYS. I AGREE. DO YOU THINK THAT SOMEWHERE, DEEP DOWN, SHE ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS THAT HER FATHER WAS KILLED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER? WELL, LEEZA WAS THERE, BUT SHE WASN'T FOCUSED ON THE MURDER. I THINK IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT SHE WAS... SEEING, HEARING, AND MAYBE EVEN FEELING AT THE TIME, THEN WE CAN GET SOME ANSWERS. [ KNOCKS ON COUNTER ] DAD. HOW -- HOW DID YOU... THEY ALL KNOW ME. LOOK, I'VE GOT MY OWN I.D. CARD AND EVERYTHING. [ SIGHS ] LISTEN, DAD, I GOT TO SEE A FEW PATIENTS BEFORE WE CAN GO TO LUNCH, OKAY? WELL, LAY ON, McDUFF.

ONLY FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. HER FATHER SHOWS UP, DOESN'T EVEN GO THROUGH THE FRONT OFFICE, AND LITERALLY DROPS HER OFF AT MY SPECIAL DAY CLASS. HOW WAS SHE DOING IN THE CLASS? FANTASTIC. I ADORED HER, AND... I DEFINITELY GOT THE FEELING THAT WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES, SHE COULD ONE DAY BECOME EXTREMELY HIGH-FUNCTIONING. HAS SHE PLAYED PIANO? YEAH. YEAH.

I'M STANDING HERE, POURING MY HEART OUT TO YOU, AND YOU'RE PLAYING SHRINK GAMES WITH ME. I'M NOT PLAYING YOUR SHRINK GAMES. </i> SOMETIMES A DOG IS JUST A DOG, AND AN "I LOVE YOU" IS JUST THAT. IF YOU WANT THE WHITE-DRESS WEDDING AND COZY, LITTLE DINNER PARTIES WITH OUR MERRY FRIENDS, THEN, UH... I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST. RIGHT NOW I'M NOT THAT GUY. SO, ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT YOUR SISTER -- THAT WAS JUST, UH... NO. SHE'S A VERY BIG PART. BUT SHE'S NOT EVERYTHING. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] OH, COME ON. DON'T GO. GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T. I WANT YOU TO STAY. TONIGHT? TOMORROW? YEAH. AND AFTER THAT? [ SIGHS ] IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. [ DOOR OPENS ] [ DOOR CLOSES ]
