when things got tough. Now, um... Well, thank you for seeing me. Man: why do you think you need therapy? Why does anyone? A million different reasons. you know that. Pick one. I have a decision to make. I need to talk it through. What decision? Whether or not to quit my job. Man #2: we're gonna be back in an hour! Woman: all right, then! see you! I can't do it, dr. skoff! The cleanup begins at 6:00 a.m., you see. By the time they get her admitted, i'd have Doctor? it's critical only. Well, it's just for 24 hours. No. The day after tomorrow's fine. Why don't you try county for tonight? They -- they've been lending a hand. Okay. Uh, carl, why is mr. thompson restrained? Because he refused to leave Without orders from the commander in chief. Obama? Roosevelt, theodore. [ chuckles ] What's going on? Oh, we have to shut down the entire psych ward For 24 hours, as of tonight. Word came down this morning. Where are you transferring all the patients to? Just to county. hey, how was palm springs? Warm. shut down? why? Well, there was a lawsuit filed against the hospital. A guy came in for a knee reconstruction. He just caught a bug. It turned out to be some kind Of serious respiratory infection that nearly killed him. [ telephone ringing ] Purely precautionary. The workers arrive tomorrow To start disinfecting the entire complex by sections. Psych drew the short straw, so they're up first. Hey, that's a nice tan. good. Arturo: so, let me understand. When you say someone might get hurt, Are you referring to a specific person Or an action on your part? I don't know how this works, so... Look, i'm running out of time. So just take me in. i need to be locked up. Unfortunately, mr. kahane, We're not accepting any new patients prior to the shutdown. If you have your therapist call me, i promise you -- Moonrise is less than two hours from now! Problem? Can, uh -- can i at least talk to someone? Certainly. Here at wharton memorial, We don't simply turn people away. Why don't you two take mr...kahane? ellis? Yes. take mr. kahane to my office, And i'll join you in a moment. Right this way. Where's gallagher? Uh, personal business. Well, why not? I mean, the man works like a slave. He needs to learn to enjoy his life, huh? [ scoffs ] you're in a rare good mood. Caroline, you made a commitment. i know. these areveryuncertain times.</i> [ knock on door ] Well, uh, all right, Would you consider scaling back To, uh, maybe half your original pledge? Caroline: sure, no problem. i can do that. Yeah, talk to george. let me know as soon as you can. Bye. thanks. [ clears throat ] Out there?oing Uh, oh, i think we'll clear the ward in time. Major donors? major bailers is more like it.</i> Between that and the lending slowdown, Our budget is disappearing. Well, how serious is it? Well, if we don't get this turned around, We'll be facing... drastic changes. wait. like my clinic?</i> Everything is on the table. Okay, what can i do? Like i-i told jack, if there's some way to cut back Without eliminating essential services... Board meeting is in 40 hours. So, when and where did the, uh, animal bite occur? I told you -- it was a werewolf, A real, live werewolf! When and where? What difference does it make?! Mr. kahane. I was walking home from -- from work. I own a print shop. It was 29 days ago, just before the last full moon. I was attacked. immediately, i knew something was -- was really wrong.</i> It's not unusual for dog -- animal bites To be associated with pain or swelling due to infection. I'm sure the doctors at the clinic explained that to you. Explain the howling, hmm? the -- the scratching at the bedpost, and my breath.</i> The "breath from hell." Literally. And that was just during the first full moon, Before the transformation had time to take full effect. [ door opens ] carl: mr. kahane. We've seen you at this hospital before, Though it's been some time, no? You were diagnosed With a generalized anxiety disorder in your teens. And you've been in some form of therapy And taking medication ever since? This isn't that. This is the beast planted inside me. What if i lose control And i harm innocent human beings? I could forfeit my soul. We can inoculate against that. We can? I'm gonna write you a prescription. You have this filled as soon as you leave here. This will counteract any transformation. No one will be harmed. You come back the day after tomorrow, Or, as dr. suarez suggested, You have your regular therapist give us a call. You sure this will work? I'm a doctor. [ breathes shakily ] [ door opens ] [ door closes ] [ telephone ringing ] woman over p.a. system: lab tech to room 200, stat.</i> lab tech to room 200, stat. There are documented cases of lycanthropy. It's rare. But extremely dangerous. You know, the myth's based on reality. He can really hurt someone. You're forgetting about the anti-man-to-wolf medication. One hour to moonrise. [ howls ] itisa big deal. All i ever wanted to be was a doctor. Man: and now? I'm not so sure. Let's say you've quit your job, You're no longer a doc. First day of the rest of your life -- What do you do now? I don't know. Make it up as i go along, like i always do. and that's worked out so well.</i> This is the way it's gonna be? I pour my heart out, And all i get from you is sarcasm? i'm not here to give you what you want.</i> i'm here to give you what you need.</i> And time is running out for you, jack. [ sighs ] [ rhythmic knock on door ] [ chuckling ] Nora: tom. [ door closes ] what brings you here? I heard you might need a little help. Help with what? Nora, i'm a salesman. I talk to people all day, every day. I know what it's like out there. The money's panicking. andyou? i have a proposition. I'm breathless with anticipation. [ chuckles ] I have it on good authority That you will fall somewhere Between $4 and $4.5 million short Of your projected contributions to keep this place afloat. Your good authority wouldn't happen to be Carl and i talk. it's no secret. We both care deeply about this institution. Oh, well, that goes without saying. Here's the deal -- Hygard pharmaceuticals will make up any shortfall In your fund-raising, Up to 100% of your original projection to the board, plusa letter of commitment</i> To conduct a new series of clinical trials Of hygard products here at wharton. Speaking of the board, We have our meeting to discuss the budget The day after tomorrow. Is that a coincidence? a timely coincidence. Mm-hmm. Think about it -- no cutbacks, no layoffs, No disruption of service to the community. We can even talk about the new children's ward You want so much. Your generosity is astounding. What could we possibly do to repay you? Oh, just one little thing. Ask. Fire jack gallagher. [ animal howling ] [ howling continues ] [ ding! ] I'm not depressed. Man: really? Decreased appetite, decreased sleep, Chronic fatigue, reduced concentration, Feelings of hopelessness, disorientation, loss. Diagnosis, doctor? I'm going through a rough patch right now. Doesn't mean i'm clinically depressed. could never happen toyou.</i> We're not immune. no one is. Depressing, isn't it? [ man speaking indistinctly ] You know i can't discuss everything the board talks about Behind closed doors. Georgia, how long have we been fighting this fight together? i need to know where i stand.</i> You still have friends in the room, including me. Friends? No matter what? No, of course not, Especially where economics are concerned. How determined are you to keep your guy on? Since jack gallagher got here, Our department has never been in better shape. He's the key to our future. Hmm. so, it's your intention to just walk in there And tell the board that you plan to retain The present management structure, To hell with hygard's offer. How many solid votes you think i'll have? 5 of 11? Um, hanson, levin, murphy, singer -- We've got those. Griffin and moore undecided. You know, if we can turn just one of those, You could win. How? Find the money someplace else. Gallagher may be the key, but without adequate funding, your psychiatric hospital may not have a future.</i> Are you saying the board would consider coming in And shutting us down entirely? [ sighs lightly ] Hey, hey, what's in the news today? Well, i haven't had a chance to read it yet, But with this economy, it can't be good. How's becky? ask her doctors. that's all i get to do.</i> Sorry. it's a sore subject. [ elevator dings ] we're seeing you at your house Yeah. okay. Hi, nora. Hey. hi. We will find some budget cuts for you by this evening. I promise. How you doing? Okay. Did you find a therapist? I think i found someone i like. Man: how much of this is really about becky? [ sighs ] All of it. I miss her. [ breathes deeply ] I think about her constantly. Uh...i'm distracted When i should be concentrating on helping people. Becky's an excuse, always has been. Go to hell. Oh, that's right. get angry. let it out. Take it out on me. An excuse for what? For always needing to run away. I just spoke with one of the undecideds. Everything is going our way. Yes, positive. we have a clear majority. Thank you. glad to hear of it. Now, concerning the arrangement we spoke about earlier -- Taken care of. Should be a lucrative deal all around. We'll see you tomorrow morning. [ elevator dings ] Arturo, qu pasa? Nada mucho, dr. belle. You haven't spoken much lately. Not much to report. Ah. no worries. Where jack gallagher has dinner and who with Are the last things on my mind. Lighten up. [ elevator dings ] woman over p.a. system: pain management,</i> please call extension 320. Carl's in a weird mood today, almost friendly. I don't get it. Ooh. i'm starving. Stop. those are for the meeting at jack's. I guess congratulations are in order. They offered you the residency in cardiology, didn't they? You gonna take it? I'm not sure yet. You know, in my opinion -- [ breathes deeply ] Jack: cup of tea, not coffee, right? Thank you. I like your place. it's great. [ doorbell buzzes ] I got it. Hey. Chloe. [ exhales deeply ] Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is your little home away from home, huh? I like it. That's right. you haven't seen it before. Sit down. have a cup of coffee. All right, guys, nora meets the suits tomorrow. And we need to, uh, save her some money And still keep the ward open. When are we gonna get out of here? Why, carl? do you have a tee time? 2:30. [ doorbell buzzes ] I'll get it. Well, uh, i have some proposals. Unfortunately, one involves the elimination Of the resident day clinic. Chloe: oh, no. let's hope it doesn't come tothat.</i> Mr. kahane. What are you doing here? I went by the hospital. Mr. kahane, i don't know how you got here, But this is completely inappropriate. Why don't you call my office tomorrow? We'll set something up. [ gun cocks ] get back. Okay. I know how to use this, all right? get back! [ door slams ] I came by looking for help yesterday, And you kicked me out the door. Not this time. The moonrise is 7:38 tonight. We're gonna stay here together until then. If anyone tries to leave, I will shoot them! okay. Does rise...n ...god help you all. Carl: mr. kahane -- Ellis -- please be sensible. hand me the weapon. [ women scream ] [ ding! ] You could have killed me. Shut up! all of you, shut up! Shut up! People will be looking for us. [ telephone ringing ] [ breathing heavily ] [ grunts ] [ clatter, ringing stops ] I want all your phones. i needallof your phones. put them in that bag.</i> Now! do it! Put it back on the couch. We haven't been introduced. Who are you? Jack gallagher. i own the place. Get you a beer? coffee? No. You a patient of dr. belle's? [ grunts ] Here, let me give you a hand with that. It's heavy. No one would listen to me. They didn't believe me. Arturo and i spoke to him initially. Dr. belle didn't believe that he fell under Which he didn't. i gave him a prescription. you gave him the equivalent of two aspirins</i> And told him to call you in the morning. are you suggesting this is my fault?</i> She's not just suggesting. You forget yourself, doctor. Jack: why exactly did you -- Did you want to be admitted last night? Doesn't matter. it's too late now. Mr. kahane told us he was going to turn into a werewolf When the full moon rose last night. A werewolf? So you believe you can turn into a wild animal? It's already happened. are -- are you not listening?! Yes, i am listening, ellis. you have a gun in your hand. Mr. kahane has a history of generalized anxiety disorder And has repeatedly taken medication for it. yes? Medication. You thought a couple of pills Was gonna stop me from transforming? Or were you just lying to me? I was merely trying to calm you down. i am not insane! Jack: ellis, you said it was too late. Too late for what? What exactly happened? Ellis: the moon was high in the sky. Hey, buddy? I had just transformed. You okay? i smelled him. You all right, man? The hair on my arms and my body was long and rough. My teeth were pointed. [ growls ] [ man screaming ] [ sighs heavily ] So you attacked a man last night After you left the hospital? Yes. And after that? I don't remember. I must have transformed back. [ sniffles ] I went back to the motel... Stripped off my clothes, Scrubbed myself clean. There was so much blood. Jack: well, what do you want from us now? I told you. You're gonna see me transform when the full moon rises. And -- and after the transformation? Well, then you'll know the truth -- That i'm not crazy. I really am this terrible thing. You okay, ellis? can i get you something? No. Veronica, how about you rustle up a couple of sandwiches And maybe a cup of coffee? I said "no." Hey, you mind if i sit down? Not too close. Wouldn't even think of it. Man: think about your other so-called relationships. What about them? Every serious relationship you've ever had, You've sabotaged. Why? You know why. i'm afraid of commitment. Come on, jack. There's much more to it than that. You guys, we can't just sit here and do nothing. Well, what do you suggest? Why don't you, uh, women -- i don't know -- Stage a distraction, Some kind of emotional breakdown Or cry or something? Look, once he's distracted, arturo can jump him. Why me? Because you're younger and you're faster. and what willyou be doing?</i> Coming up with the plan. Griff, have you spoken to georgia yet? Well, why is it moot? Well -- well, she told me that you were still undecided. [ sighs ] Griff, look, i'm gonna be really honest with you. you're my last chance. ireallyneed your help.</i> You've always been there for us. If it weren't for you, We wouldn't even have a day clinic. [ dial tone ] [ sighs ] Jack: we have four hours to talk him So, we -- we're supposed to just treat him Like any other patient? Stop talking about me! You're a man with a gun who thinks he's a werewolf. We're psychiatrists. Of course we're talking about you. Now, why don't you tell us what happened? I've already told them. Well, we need some evidence. When the moon rises, You'll have all the evidence you're gonna need. Arturo: mr. kahane, It would help everybody if they knew the full story. Fine. 29 days ago, i was attacked by a werewolf. Arturo: the clinic in pasadena Erroneously treated him for a dog bite. Ellis, when you were a child, did you own a dog? We had a neighbor who used to have a pit bull. It would run up to the fence and show its teeth. Once in a while, it would get out, Run around the neighborhood. I wouldn't know where it was. It would scare the crap out of me. This clinic in pasadena -- did they give you a shot? Yeah, a whole bunch of them. So you were treated for rabies. Yeah. But i-i knew it wasn't gonna cure me. What's gonna cure you? nothing can cure me. this is who i am now!</i> All right, ellis. Do you have a family? I had a life! i own a business! My family -- they -- I have a wife... Two kids. Nick -- he just turned 8. Can throw a football 30 yards. Danny -- He's 18 months old. He's already talking. He's so smart. Do they -- do they know about... I told sandra what happened to me. She held me, and we cried together. She's the one who told me to go to the hospital. Are you still living at home? I left two weeks ago. I was afraid i was gonna hurt them. For your information... ...i transform body and soul. It's not me. I don't know what i'm capable of. [ crying ] What? Jack. What's it say? Let me see it. let me see! Take it. take it. He's dead. I didn't dream it. Dead. Oh, my god, i really did it. I killed last night. [ gunshot ] Oh! [ ding! ] I told you. i told you what would happen. This isn't who i am! No, it isn't, ellis. you're right. I can't escape him. How is he? he's not good! he's -- Chloe: he's going into shock. he needs an e.r.now. No. no one's leaving! Then make us understand why, ellis. Tell us everything we need to know about last night. Come on! no. no, no, no. You think that i'm crazy, That i imagined it, but it was real. I woke up covered in blood! What do you mean, "woke up"?! [ dog barking in distance ] I must have passed out when i turned back. I don't know. i don't remember. Tell us what you do remember. I was tired, achy... Dizzy -- what difference does it make?! I tore a man's throat out! Calm down. sit down. [ breathing heavily ] he did not deserve to die.</i> Probably had a family. I don't even know. Man: you hate being alone. I frickin' hate it. So get off your ass and find someone. that's not the point. what is the point?</i> I can't let myself get involved, Can't get married, have a family. Why not? Say it. Because something might happen to me. [ groans lightly ] Jack. [ breathing heavily ] Dr. belle's been blackmailing me. The boy's delirious. No, i just don't care anymore. I falsified my transcripts When i applied for residency here. Carl found out, And he's been using it to get me to spy on you ever since. He wants jack out. He's been putting a list together Of everything you've done. And i helped him. I'm sorry, jack. i'm so sorry. I'm sorry you were put in that position. [ grunting lightly ] This is unacceptable. I don't need a lecture from a rank amateur Who almost single-handedly brought down the hospital. I mean, jack... Your own sister didn't trust you to treat her. Maybe she had a point. Man: what do you think is gonna happen? [ exhales ] I can't talk about it. You have to. Same thing that happened to becky. Schizophrenia. One day she's fine, and the next she's -- She's counting imaginary cracks in the ceiling. Why her? Why not me? He's losing consciousness. We need an e.r. now! No. no, everyone stays. you want him to die, too?! you want to kill two people?!</i> No, but the wolf is inside me. I can't stop it from coming out! Pulse is weak and thready. do something! Oh, we can't. this lunatic has got a gun. If you had just listened to me, None of this would have happened. They wouldn't be here. He wouldn't have been shot! Jack: ellis! take it easy. Take it easy. i have a suggestion. It might just help. Bite me. What?! No. no, i-i can't. You don't want to face the moonrise alone. That's why we're here. you're all alone. I don't want to be alone now. No. come on. Two werewolves have got to be better than one. Wh-why would you do that for me? Fancy a change. i'm dying to know what happens. Bite it, right here, hard. Wait -- Go on. Ohh. [ both breathing heavily ] Aah. There you go. There you go. [ crying ] Okay. Now we're in this together. [ crying ] [ ding! ] Am i going to jail? You're here in custody on a 72-hour hold, To be assessed. Thanks, officer. You can close the door. we'll be fine. All right. [ door closes ] When i change -- when we change...  ...or not... Then we'll see. You don't believe it's gonna happen, do you? Here's what i think. Doctor speak -- Your pathological fear of dogs, Combined with the bite, the fever, The infection, the fact that they occurred During last month's full moon -- It all adds up to psychosis. No. no, no. No, see, the man in the park was real. The blood was real. It was in the newspapers. i saw it! Do you own a gun? No. have you ever owned a gun?</i> No. Where did you get the gun you had today? I don't know. I must have picked it up somewhere. You got it from the man who assaulted you. That man wasn't trying to help you, ellis. He knocked you out, tried to mug you. The police say he has a long history Of violent armed robberies. I killed him. he was a human being, and i killed him.</i> It was self-defense. I shot a doctor, for god's sake! He'll be fine. he's a tough kid. That doesn't change what i am. I infected you. i ruined your life. Who knows what i'm capable of?! We'll soon find out what you're capable of, And we'll do it together. Now, relax. Lie down for me. [ breathes deeply ] Do you think my family will ever forgive me? They already have. they'll be here tomorrow. [ sighs ] [ breathes deeply ] Look at it this way -- You're either crazy, or you're a werewolf. Either way, we'll deal with it. [ sniffles ] One day i'll wake up. Man: hear voices? Hallucinate? yeah. Be institutionalized, No control over your own destiny. You know the statistics. What are the chances of late-onset schizophrenia In a man of our age? [ sighs ] Practically nil. An irrational fear. You asked me what i was afraid of. Irrational or not, it's there. [ chuckles ] This is gonna make one hell of a pickup line. I can see it now -- "so, there i was, "face-to-face with a wolf man and a gun, But there were lives at stake, so i went for it." Yeah, like a complete idiot. [ sighs ] Actually... I thought you were pretty freakin' brave. What are you doing hanging around here, When there's a bunch of reporters outside? You can go get your 15 minutes of fame. Nora's keeping them at bay. Besides, the only person They're really interested in talking to is jack. Of course. So... This is goodbye? I don't know. I'm having second thoughts about cardiology. Really? why? Held hostage by a mythical creature, Forged documents, elaborate spy plots? How can a triple bypass hope to compete? I'm a little worried about the forging and spying. Like jack said, Carl can't afford to let any of this surface Any more than you can. I think it's a tie. You know, you're just in time for my sponge bath. Oh. i'll go get malcolm. [ both laugh ] [ crying ] [ crying ] There you go. Jack: everyone thinks i'm fearless, a risk taker. I've been a coward. So what are you gonna do about it? I still don't know. All you ever wanted to be was a doctor, remember? So be a doctor. Here? Well, you're here now, doing a job you love. And you're not half-bad at it. It's that simple, huh? No, the hard work is just beginning. What do you demand from your patients, Before anything else? That they face their problems. So face your problems, jack. [ chuckles ] I must be crazy already, Sitting here talking to myself. In that case, what are you worried about? Do we try to push the board meeting back a couple days? I say we can still pull this off. I think i can still spin this situation our way. Gallagher allowed a dangerous lunatic To take his staff hostage. One was seriously wounded. I was nearly killed. how's that heroic? Has nora come up with any alternatives? No. She's been striking out all over town. Good. Let's go rub her face in it. Not tonight. Dr. gallagher and i will deliver a statement To the press sometime tomorrow. Well, our main concern right now Is getting the hospital up and running by morning. Yes, mr. kahane is here, undergoing treatment. Man: fine. well, thanks a lot. Thank you. okay. So, you mean to say, While we were being held hostage with a gun to our heads, Hygard was doing the same thing to you? You can bet carl's into this up to his eyeballs. He almost had me. So what changed? Well, the media's all over it now. The board can't force me to fire the hero of the hour. It's a two-day story, Stacked against hygard's millions. The most it'll do is buy us a little time. Well, i could use that time To try to find a little bit more money. If you could have, you would have. It's too much to risk the entire psychiatric program Against one man's job. Take the deal. [ sighs ] What kind of place would this be If hygard pharmaceuticals and other big companies Can just buy us? As long as you and veronica are here, You'll make it right. Well, so what? you gonna resign? No, you can't resign. so just -- I think i just did. Well, i'm not accepting your resignation. Well, then fire me. Oh, jack, shut up. what if it's in my best interest?</i> [ door opens ] Oh, hey. hey, tom, look -- [ chuckles ] Sparky and the gang -- they're all here. How fun. Your timing's impeccable, gentlemen. Tom. Jack. Carl. Oh, god. Jack! [ breathing heavily ] [ chuckles ] That's a -- that's an unprovoked attack. Directed towards another hospital employee. Ah. Immediate and irrevocable grounds for dismissal. [ sighs ] You're fired. Nice. [ indistinct conversations ] Where am i going? Not a clue. Nearest bar, nepal... Never-never land. But i feel optimistic... And terrified. [ whistles ] Where am i going? You'll be the first to hear.
