anxiety, and disorganized thinking. Artis. Mr. Sawyer's all over the map. He also has a very good grasp of medical, psychological terminology straight out of the DSM-IV. Leading you to conclude? Factitious disorder. Do you suspect Maliering? There's no indication of symptoms manufactured for material gain, no. Correct... both of you... this time. Is there something else, Dr. Belle? Our new Director of Psychiatric Services arrives today, but make no mistake, as senior staff attending with the overall responsibility for your supervision and training, ultimately, whether you find a place at this hospital or not depends entirely upon me. Any sign of the new head honcho? Nada. I don't even know what I'm looking for. Country mouse adrift in the big city. He ran a clinic in Vermont, Carl. He wasn't plowing the back 40. God, what was Nora thinking? I say give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe Dr. Gallagher has something to add. Like zero experience running a high-volume psychiatric facility? You're taking this well. After <i>I</i> was screwed out of the job, I suppose it could have always gone to <i>you.</i> Should have. Not while I have a pulse. I refuse to get hysterical about it. Last name Martin, first name Vincent. We matched him up to a missing-person's report. He was stark naked, no I.D., screaming his freaking head off, standing in the middle of the highway. Okay, pal. Behave yourself, huh? Docs here are gonna fix you up just fine. I see you! - Have a Code white. Get it off! Security, code 3, first floor. I know who you are! I can't be the only one. Look. Flesh -- human flesh! No, no! Hold it right ere. You'll never make me like you! Keep away! Keep away! You can't have me! Hey! - Get back! I'm real, too. Flesh -- human flesh! You're not alone. Get down on the floor and put your hands behind your head. What about them? We'll fight em together. I've got your back. Except we're outnumbered. Might be better to choose our battles. Not give up! - Not give up! Not give up! Bide our time! Live. Live to fight another day. Huh? Trust me. Trust me. Scratch the Haldol, doctor. Let's take the patient to seclusion and clean him up. Excuse me?! Who the hell are you? Dr. Jack Gallagher. I guess I'm the new head honcho. Staff meeting tomorrow morning. I'll introduce you to everyone. And after that, it's all yours. So, there I was, first day in the big city. Suddenly, it occurs to me... "take all your clothes off. Give the hardworking folks in admitting a cheap thrill." You have to admit, it did the trick. You acted to gain a patient's trust. Fine. But what about the respect and trust of your staff? You think getting butt naked on your first day of work helped you to achieve that? Couldn't say. Never tried it before. 'Sides... it'll be forgotten by tomorrow. Really? Posted on the Hospital intranet. Want the advice of a Harvard Business School graduate? Seek royalties. It's been downloaded more than Paris Hilton's sex tape. You look great, Nora. Move in, doctor, but don't get too comfortable. Another stunt like that, and you'll be out... ...on your very public ass. Did you hear what happened? I can't believe we missed it. Looks like we're about to become a clothing-optional facility. You have a problem with that? Mind says no, but the body says follow. Doctor. Jack. Veronica. So, you worked under my predecessor -- Dr. Friedman? Yes, for 10 years since my internship. He was my mentor. Can't believe he's gone. Or that they brought in an outsider from nowhere to take his place? So, you're from the U.K. Originally. What tipped you off? And you were in Somalia with Doctors Without Borders. That must have been intense. Yeah. Huh. Nice talking to you. They're doing some experimental drug therapy... Vincent Martin, I'm Dr. Gallagher. We, uh -- we met earlier. Do you remember? I don't. They gave me something. Eh. That's just enough joy juice to take the edge off. All right, here's the deal, Vince -- I'm gonna cut you loose, and you're gonna promise not to get too excited. It's okay, Ray. Anyone gets hurt, I'm in a world of trouble. You buy a one-way ticket to Thorazineville. When can I go home? Answer a question first. Why did you stop taking your meds? The blood work came back your system's clean. Been off maybe two or three weeks. I don't know. Maybe I just forgot. It happens. The thing is, according to your records, it hasn't happened to you in 12 years. What do you see out there? It's not real. It's in my head. I know. I know that. Well, that puts you way ahead of the game. I thought I could do both. I can't. I was wrong. Thought you could do both what? - Don't worry about it. Just put me back on my meds so I can get back to my life. Just slow down there, Vincent. You just got here. Come on. Let's take some time. - I don't have time! No! Okay? - I got to get home. Getting you home is what this is all about. Grayson, hi. I'm Dr. Hayden-Jones. I understand that you'd like to attend my resident day clinic once you've been released. It's a condition of my suspended sentence. I understand that you're a cat lover. Cats are very intuitive. A cat person is about the nicest thing you could call me. I agree. I just wish I could have one now. But my husband's allergic. And I like the longhairs the best. Mm. I have all kinds -- Tabbies, Siamese. So I heard. You had 20 in your apartment? Mostly strays -- They follow me home sometimes, or people give them to me. I also heard from the police that you had a bunch of them in your freezer. When they died, I-I-I couldn't bury them in the ground -- so heartless. And I couldn't burn them, you know? Their beautiful fur? When we lose someone we love, it -- it just plain hurts. But eventually, we -- we learn to let go. I don't know how to do that. Well, that's what we can work on here. In-house pharmacist, report to satellite pharmacy. Dr. Gallagher. I'm Edolie Martin, Vincent's sister. Oh, I'm glad you're here. Uh, you can see Vincent, of course. But first, I've got about a million questions. Um, I know he lives with you. Did you know he's discontinued -- I want Vincent released to me immediately. I'm having him transferred. No, you're having him <i>committed.</i> To Twelve Oaks Psychiatric Facility. Ms. Martin, Vincent shouldn't be institutionalized. He's self-aware, self-sufficient for many years. This is a mistake. I'm not <i>asking,</i> doctor. I have Power of Attorney. Sign here. By law, I have 72 hours to observe him. He's only been here 8. Then I'll be back in 64. Oh, Dr. Gallagher. I was wondering, have you had the chance to go through the department budget? Gave it a shot last night. Man, talk about a cure for insomnia. You do understand, of course, that it's a part of the Director's job to approve the budget. I'll get around to it. - Oh, you're gonna have to do better than that. For one thing, the funding is about to expire on my resident day clinic. This program, which I founded -- Sure. Resident Day Clinic, RDC. I'll drop by later and check it out. Uh, okay. Our new Director of Psychiatric Services comes to us from the Pinewood Veterans Post-traumatic Stress Clinic in Killington, Vermont. Dr. Gallagher is board-certified in psychiatric medicine. Please join me in welcoming Jack Gallagher. First staff meeting. Hot coffee, juice... Jelly doughnuts. The, uh -- the problem is, we're in here, and they're out there. Who's out there? Patients. You see, gang, I'm thinking this whole secret-society thing isn't the best way to go. So, starting today, I've invited a few of the patients to sit in. You want us discuss diagnoses and treatment in front of the patients? Bang on. There's a tendency -- and I'm as guilty as anyone -- to wall ourselves up from the people we're here to help. But it's -- it's really more their hospital than ours. We work for them. They have the right to be involved in their own recovery. We're M.D.s, not social workers. M.D. as in "medical doctor," not "medical deity." It's their heads. These people are in our care. They're our responsibility. There are liability issues. Find the joker. It's not there. Unlocking the mysteries of the human brain is no easy gig. So, why not use every possible resource? Experiment, break the mold, use every trick in the book -- Anything that gives us an edge. And if you're uncomfortable with that, look, I'll respect your prerogatives as medical professionals. And I hear they're hiring at County. Gypsy, come on in. Have a little seat right there. What's the task? Oh. We're creating personal agendas, goal setting, time allocation -- just determining priorities. Is there ever any, uh, unstructured activity? No. - Oh. You disapprove? Hey, I'm just here to observe. Then observe. Terrific, Steven. Hi. Oh, really? Okay. I'll be right back. Can I see you a minute, doctor? Ooh! What the hell do you think you're doing? I heard the music. It sounded cool. I just figured -- you just figured that you could waltz in here and, on a whim, tamper with my course of treatment. It's a break from routine. Three months ago, most of those people could barely get out of bed and shower by themselves. With the help of my <i>routine,</i> they're beginning to lead productive lives. All right. You've created a safe, quiet, controlled environment. But reality is <i>loud,</i> messy, and full of surprises. The question is, does it translate? Just let me ask you a question. Do you honestly think you're qualified for this job? Probably not. Then why are you here? New challenge, new surroundings. Do you really care? No, what I care about is whether or not you're planning on reading the damn budget and funding me. Can we finish this later? What's going on, Vince? Useless. What is? This is trashed. I'll call maintenance. Okay, Vincent, you're an artist. Not anymore. "Can't do both." Okay, take another right there. Oh, oh! - Now take a left, take a left. Oh, got it. - Hey, hey. Hi? Is your mum around? Um, are you a friend of hers? I'm a friend of your uncle Vincent. Is he okay? My mommy said he's sick. When's he coming home? I'm not too sure yet. One second. Um, I made something for him. I-I'll be right back. One second. What do you want? Some information about Vincent. You have his medical records. I need to know what he's been up to for the last few years. What's changed? - Joshua, honey, can you go watch TV for a while? Night before last, my kids and I were awakened in the middle of the night by Vincent ranting to himself. When I tried to talk to him, he pushed me down on the lawn and ran off. You had no idea that he's gone off his meds? If I had, I would have done something about it. The police found him standing in the middle of traffic! He could have been killed... or someone else. I won't let that happen. I am responsible for Vincent, not <i>you!</i> Kids seem pretty attached to him. When I was 15, Vincent chased me and my 7-year-old brother Leo around the house with a screwdriver. Joshua and Emily have never seen him when he's like that. I intend to keep it that way. I know how schizophrenia can rip a family apart. Does Leo have much to do with Vincent. Vincent can't live here anymore. I don't suppose I could see his room? Visiting hours are over, doctor. Um, will you give this to Vincent? Of course. Thanks. Nora, hi. Well, how the hell did he just walk off the ward? All right. Never mind. Uh, no, no, no, no, no. T-tell the police not to confront him. That's important. Tell them to wait till I get there. Yeah. All right. Come on in, doc. Here he is. Thank you. Hey. Go away! I got to work. If I lose this job, I'll never get to go home. Vincent, this is what you do all day? Uh-huh. For 10 years. They like me here. I'm a hard worker. Every day, I show up on time. They can count on me. That's all good. - I'm independent. I get my own paycheck every week, and I take it to the bank. I'm not a problem. I take care of myself. Is my boss gonna fire me? He doesn't <i>want</i> to. You're a valuable employee. How much trouble am I in? I can cover for all that if we go back to the hospital now. No, no, no, I need to stay here and show them that they can still trust me. You need to get well. Everything will be okay if you put me back on my medication. I was stupid to think it would be different. What would be different? Oh, I really messed up this time. Hey. This is for you. It's from Emily. She sends her love. She wants you to get well, too. Okay. Okay. Hey. Hi, guys. Come on in. I have an assignment for you. - Sure. I need you to find Vincent's younger brother, Leo, and talk to him. He works for a nonprofit organization called, um, Earth Now. It's on the West Side. - I'll make some calls. No, no, no, no. No, I need you to go there and talk to him face-to-face. You want us to leave the ward? Yeah. Problem? We don't do that. We're residents. We treat the person, not just the disease. Vincent's friends, family, relationships that are outside this hospital. It's -- it's all the stuff you can't pull off the chart. Anything in particular you want to know? Yeah. For starters, I want to know why he went off his meds. Got it. Good. Okay. Thanks, guys. Are you always as pissed off as you look? I'm a doctor, not a freaking detective. Yes, my sister. Man, talk about having a stick up your ass. I take it you guys weren't close. No way -- I've barely talked to her or Vincent since our folks died. That is about a year ago, right? Uh, yeah car accident. But we were a pretty dysfunctional family anyways, especially after Vincent went bonkers. Hey, Planet Now, guys. Thank you. My parents couldn't deal with it at all. They just kind of checked out. Who looked after you? Well, pretty much Edolie. So, maybe that's why she's got that stick up her ass -- taking care of a younger brother, worrying about an older one with a mental illness. I know. Leo the jerk. What else is new? Hey, do you guys know how many harbor seals die every year off the California coast of pollution? I'm guessing more than five. Can we put a pin on saving the planet for a minute? Why do you think Vincent went off his meds? Well, my mom and dad left the house we all grew up into Edolie. I guess they figured Vincent was too out of it and I was just a druggie, which I was. Not anymore. Uh, anyways, Edolie had just gotten a divorce, and Vincent was living with her and the kids, so they all moved back into the parents' house together. Vincent must have found his old drawings. It's just a guess. Hey. Are you seeing anybody? So, if he'd never seen the old drawings... he never would have remembered his old life. Other than the carving on the wall, has Vincent tried to draw anything since he's been here? No. It's an interesting thought, though. Nice work, you guys. You really should get out more. Yeah, I'd like a cab, please. Ms. Martin? Anyone home? Sir, put your hands where I can see them. Busted. What's next? Scaling the Hollywood sign? Uh, celebrity stalking? I made a house call. Without the owner's consent, it's called breaking and entering. You're a hospital Department Head! You don't make house calls! I played a hunch. It paid off. Nice ride -- very L.A. I just hung up with Edolie Martin. She's prepared to drop all criminal charges against you and forgo any civil suit against the hospital... if you agree... to release Vincent to Twelve Oaks now. I still have 24 hours. What could possibly change in 24 hours except for that you lose your license and the hospital goes bankrupt? Thanks for bailing me out. This is serious, Jack. I have to convene a medical-review panel. Bring it on. This panel is here to discuss treatment options in the case of patient Vincent Martin. We're on the record. Here's the plan. Bag the Haldol. Let's detox him completely. No medication, nothing? I'll stabilize him temporarily without drugs. To what end? 12 years ago, a doctor mixed Vince a medication cocktail, and he improved. Since then, he's changed. Hell, how we treat the disease has changed. Let's get rid of the old chemistry and figure out how sick he really is. Stabilize how? Megavitamins, neurofeedback, acupuncture, homeopathic medies... juggling tomatoes -- whatever works. You can't treat schizophrenia with aromatherapy. The pharmacology's been successful for... a dozen years, huh? Why deviate? You call it a success. I say the patient's been crippled. You mean creatively. He's a gifted artist, and for the last 12 year he's been stuck in a plumbing warehouse, moving boxes from one pile to another. And that's about to get worse. He's about to be filed away in an institution for life. The preferred methodology would be to restore Mr. Martin's drug intake to prior levels then reduce it incrementally to establish a new threshold. He's already gone through most of the withdrawal. We don't have the time to go back to square one. So, you said, "stabilize him temporarily without drugs." He's gonna need drugs. Of course he is. And counseling. But the point is, we have an opportunity right now to build him a new regimen. Y-you don't have time for that, either. I talked to the attorneys. Even if this panel grants you the 20 or so remaining hours, after that, the sister gets him, and we risk getting sued. I want every single hour. It's worth the risk. What happened? Well, they found another freezer in Mr. Emerson's garage. More felines? No. His wife. Really? - Mm-hmm. I wouldn't have taken him for a sociopath. Oh, no. She died of natural causes. He doesn't kill. He stores. Cold comfort to the wife. Excuse me. Could you give us a minute? Mm-hmm. - Thank you. Grayson, are you all right? Don't be disappointed with me. - No, I'm not. April was my whole life. I wanted to stay close to her until... Until what? The technology became available, you know, to bring her back. I just... couldn't let go. I-I enjoyed talking to you. I hope we can continue our conversation. We will, because you'll come back. Okay. Take care, Grayson. Go away. Cut me some slack, Vincent. I could use the company. Huh? What time is it? It's late. I-I can't. That's all right. We've got all night. You got a minute? Anything you need. Oh, Jack wanted you to be present today at his meeting with Edolie Martin. No. I'm in no hurry. You can take as long as you need to find a replacement. Ronnie, why? You know why. You made your choice. This is too quick. Give yourself time to adapt. Why should I adapt? I'm worked here my entire career. This is my home. And now <i>I</i> have to adapt? The hell I will. You me some guy on a ski vacation. Next thing I kn-- First of all, it was a conference. Second of all, I saw his clinic. Can you help me out, nor can you make me understand? Jack Gallagher hadn't been here five minutes when he stripped down naked. Oh, I was there. Would <i>you</i> have, under any circumstances? Would have found another way. Been more profession. - Yes. In that moment, Jack didn't care about anything but the patient -- not propriety, not professionalism, not ridicule. That's why I hired him. Sleep on this, please. If you come back tomorrow, I won't try to talk you out of it. You never would have hired Gallagher two years ago. Go on, say it -- before I had cancer, no, probably not. That would have been crazy. Time's up. Five minutes. That all I ask. Then you can lock the door and throw away the key. I love my brother. I also know what he's capable of. I've lived with him my whole life. But now I'm a single mother with two young children. I won't put my kids through that. Sign it. Look at these. I-I've seen them. I have hundreds of Vincent's old illustrations. He was a prodigy before he got sick. He won awards. He hasn't worked since he drew these last night. He wanted that to be his last. After that it's a quick trip to the funny farm. What are you proposing? Vincent's now drug-free. From here, we comprise a new cocktail, get him stable. This is Dr. Hayden-Jones. She runs a day clinic here, and it's shown remarkable success in bridging the gap between full-time and part-time care. I would be more than happy to -- to tell you all about it, if you're interested. What does Vincent want? Vincent wants to go home, be with his family. And if that means going back on his meds and giving up on his amazing gift and -- and hauling boxes around a freaking warehouse, well, then, so be it. He's -- he's willing to sacrifice everything... because he loves you and the children so much. I'm not offering guarantees. The last thing anyone wants to do is put you or your children in danger. This is a chance... - No more. Thank you. Uh, Dr. Gallagher, join me. Please. Thanks. How are you settling in? Sure opinions would vary. Made quite an impact. ???A a change from our last director. He tended to operate below the radar. Probably very wise. Dr. Friedman and I had an agreement. Hopefully you and I can achieve a similar understanding. Anything's possible. As you may or may not know... ...I specialize in the fields of addiction, pharmacology. Growth areas. And I've been fortunate enough to bring major pharmaceutical companies here to Wharton to conduct their research trials. That's impressive. It is, and quite profitable for the hospital. So, about this understanding? In the past, I've enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy. Ah. In exchange, perhaps I can help <i>you</i> out, too. I appreciate the thought. Thank you. I think you and I can become great allies, Dr. Gallagher. Looking forward to it. You continue to have a great day, all right? Enter. I just wanted to thank you for supporting the clinic. It's a good program. Come in, come in. Sit down. Ay-Yi-Yi. Yeah. Another roller-coaster day in the fun house and with you driving, I have a sinking feeling we're in for more of the same. Yeah. You're married. Yes. To a jazz musician. Eight years this June. You're not. Close...no cigar. So, who was she? Someone I met in med school. - Mm-hmm. She was an oncologist. Nearly went that route myself. So, how did you wind up a shrink? I guess I've always had brains on the brain. Short story? Dad was in the military. Mum worked as a nurse at the V.A. Hospital. Sometimes I used to go by there after school. Hey, kid. Comeere. Come here. Do me a favor, will you? Scratch my foot. I can't reach. No, no, no. The other one. Whew! Come on! It's killing me! Whew! Thanks a million, kid. So, here's this guy, and his head's telling him there should be a foot there, even when his eyes can't see it. And I'm thinking, "interesting." Still is. And I'm thinking, "I haven't got a clue who you are or if that story is even remotely true." Hang in there. It'll be fun. Oh, I'm not going anywhere. How are you feeling? I'm <i>feeling.</i> Everything seems really different. Medication didn't just take away your ability to paint. It took away the -- the passions, the pains, the highs, the lows -- everything that made you human. I'm afraid I'm gonna lose control again. It's possible. It's got to be worth the chance, though, right? Look, if it comes down to a choice between my drawing and my family -- hey, no choice. - Of course. But be patient. You've only just started. Right over there. See? Uncle Vincent! Finally! I missed you! I missed you, too. Looking good. - How's it been going? It's been kind of rough, actually. Well, you're back. Hi. Hi. Hey, guys. It's good to see you guys. Yeah. Beck? I'm glad you've called. I was thinking about you. Becky, please say something. Let me know you're there. I'm in L.A., too. Can you believe it? Listen, Becky, you don't have to, but maybe you could give mum and dad a call. They're, uh... They'd love to talk to you. You don't have to say anything. You know, just if you feel like it, you could give them a ring. I'm at Wharton Memorial. It's on 3rd street. You can always get me there. Listen, Becky... you know, if you need anything -- Um, money or, uh... Hey, hey, it's Jack. Leave a message. . Gallagher, this is Wharton Memorial. L.A.F.D. is in transit with a potential suicide risk for intake. Female, age 15, suspected drug- and alcohol-related intoxication. Please call in A.S.A.P. Thank you.
