[ sighs ] you know what? i'm -- i'm going in there, i mean, just to say hello. hey. you look so gorgeous. [ <i>laughs</i> ] jack said i was a mess. he's a doctor. what do doctors know? yeah, i'm sorry. doesn't she look gorgeous? she seems safe. dr. gallagher? major. i'm here about clay jefferson -- arlen rawlins. is thisan official visit well, i know clay. i was one of his commanding officers in iraq. he's a fine young man -- served his country with distinction. how's he doing? i'm curious how you know he was here. our patient files are confidential. or at least i thought they were. well, it's nothing cloak-and-dagger. clay receives medical disabilities, and the injury to his hand prompted an inquiry. that's all. from whom? i thought you might like to see clay's service record. i thought it might be useful, give you some additional insight. thank you for the personal delivery. the army takes care of its own. even after they've left? bonds of loyalty formed between soldiers serving in wartime transcends formalities of status. there's nothing in here about ptsd. when he was in the hospital, he was being treated for his physical injuries. ptsd was never diagnosed. now, for the record, i'm not one of these people who doesn't believe in the disease or its seriousness. in fact, i am very familiar with the work you've done with veterans in your vermont clinic. it's commendable. you seem to be familiar with a lot of things, major. i try to stay informed. i know that clay will receive the care he needs here, doc. anything i can do to assist, just ask. thank you. woman on p.a.: orderly to ward two. orderly to ward two. what have i done now? nothing yet. preemptive strike? did your parents get here yet? parent, stepfather. oh, god. spare me the family drama. what's your plan with becky? as soon as she gets a little stronger, i'll transfer her to a long-term-care facility. narrowed it down to two -- they're both excellent. great physical eonments, top staff. who've already agreed to let you puppet-master her recovery from afar? you know, just a guess. what of it? i'm worried about your focus, for your sake as well as the hospital's. i'll find the right balance, nora. where are these facilities? one's north of san diego. the other's in ojai. i'll see her on my days off and vacations. i'll give you plenty of notice. and no time for yourself. i don't see it as a burden. it's actually more of a gift. and look on the bright side. i finally get to buy a car. what's that for? for a little. clay: i can walk. regulations -- i know you know about regulations. if i wanted to take off, how would you stop me? recent surgery, major trauma -- you might not be as fast as you think. i wouldn't run <i>from</i> you. i'd run <i>through</i> you. well, given your youth and your training, you'd probably take me in a fair fight. ??? but that's not the point. what is? you can threaten me, insult me, ignore me. you can do all those things. but you won't shake me, so you might as well stop trying. why did you decide on a military career? i'm third-generation army. i bleed khaki. at least i did. i spent my teens on naval bases. where? south carolina, new england, d.c. area -- my stepfather. he was, uh.. he's retired two years ago. he was a vice admiral. [ clears throat ] annapolis man. i got a little problem with you, clay. why's that? well, if you don't open up, your whole evaluation is gonna have to be solely based on your actions. i'll take what i deserve. what you <i>think</i> you deserve. i might have a different opinion. see, mental disease, disorders, phobias, whatever you want to call them they can be traced back as far as genetics, but they can also be the body's reaction to stress. there's a reason you wanted to hurt yourself. and it's got to start somewhere. what do you want to know? i want you to bookend your memory loss for me -- the last thing you remember before you don't and the first thing you remember after. man: go, go, go, go, go! my platoon was taking fire. rpg! down, down, down, down, down! look out! left two wounded with the medic back on the road. we got pinned down. and that's when it happened. sonny! sonny went ahead. next thing, everything exploded -- maybe an i.e.d. i woke up in the hospital in the green zone. sonny didn't make it. sonny? first lieutenant sonny bostock -- my best friend. a commander of yours dropped by to see me today. major arlen rawlins. who? mum: i love it. ah, it lacks soul. [ laughs ] no. what it lacks is a woman's touch. oh, don't go there. [ laughs ] i'm your mother. i can go there. thank you, sweetie. i guess some things never change. cheers what are her chances, realistically? i mean, will she ebe able to live an ordinary life? well, leshoot for extraordinary. is that optimism or determination? [ laughs ] both. how's life, mum? better now. james has a job. did you know? no. yeah, he's consulting with a -- for a defense contractor. and -- retirement didn't suit him. we're doing very well, in fact. that's great. he's a fine man, your father. he <i>was</i> a fine man who died a long time ago. oh, jack, you are so stubborn. i don't want to have this conversation with you anymore. tomorrow, when you drop by to see becky, have them come find me. i'd like to go over her transfer plans. of course. i worry about you. i want you to be happier. we found her. she's safe. and she'll finally get the care she needs. okay. laney: why won't he see us? i was gonna ask you the same thing. i don't know. shame, i guess. i mean, he loves nathan every bit as much as i do. the idea of hurting him would make him sick. you know, at first i -- i was convinced that i didn't want him around us anymore. now i -- i just want him home. yeah. so, what do you think? when did he start building it? about six weeks ago. any idea what set it off? 4vyeah, he ran into moon at the hospital after one of the checkups. moono's moon? he was a friend from his platoon. he was one of the men wounded during the initial attack. so, moon told him something? he said that clay came back to the humvees to check on him. this was after sonny had been killed. so suddenly, that couple of seconds that he couldn't remember turned into a couple of hours. and the next day, he started hauling in bags of sand and cement. what -- what are you gonna do with the diorama? hire someone to haul it away. hold off on that for a while. i miss you. you shouldn't be here. you all right? uh-huh. perfect. can you do a favor for me? anything. be nice to james. mum put you up to that? no. remember when mum first brought him home for dinner? he was an ass. he was frightened. of what? us. will you go back to sleep? okay. you went to my home? you took pictures of my work? laney misses you. so does your son. i can't go back there after what's happened. i think you've punished yourself enough. come here. which one of these little fellows is you? come here, lieutenant. this guy? yeah. what about sonny? well, um, he was supposed to stay back with the wounded, seal off the road. i don't know where he came from. all right. so, this iu. where were you leading your team? there. the gunshots came from the roof. i saw muzzle flashes and movement. all right. there's something else i don't understand -- this, this, and those. bullet holes. real bullet holes? i'd been working the model all night. everything felt wrong. i got frustrated, and i lost it. all right, so, you fire three times. you hear a sound. you turn. your cover with your loaded weapon. it's nathan. he thought i was playing with him. but it was sonny that i saw. clay! all right, so, you lower your weapon. nathan's fine. he's safe. laney's safe. no harm done. but you switch the gun to your other hand, and you fire. what are you thinking? it ends here. hey. hey [ clears throat ] what's all this? uh, it's a patient -- army lieutenant wounded in iraq. those are of a model he built to re-create a situation in which he was wounded. he's got some memory loss. i'm trying to help him fill in the blanks. where's mum? she's still with becky. how is she? she's not too good today. she's confused. i don't understand what -- what happened. well, i told you. she goes in and out. she's doing really well, but she's a long way from stable. look, james, i'm -- i'm kind of under the pump. can we make it for later? we can eat at the loft. oh, yeah, yeah, sure. that -- that sounds fine. so, this is -- this is meant to replicate a combat situation? yes. yes, it is. hmm. can you take a look at these? you can take them with you. yeah. [ sighs ] all right. what's so interesting? well, you know, old habi die hard. when you see something, i'd like to know. your patient was the commander, right? yeah, it's -- he's here. yeah, well, he's a lousy soldier, jack. well, he's west point. what? well, all right, you tell me exactly what i'm looking at here. all right, so, clay's leading his men in -- in this direction towards this building here when they start coming under heavy fire. right, and this is the target structure, right? yeah. well, why would he have his men enfilade? i'm sorry, what? well, lined up to take enemy fire along their longest axis. that's bad? that's fatal -- the easiway for the enemy to inflict maximum casualties. you h... all right, here. see? these are the good guys, okay? yeah. i'm the bad guys. how can i miss? i miss the guy in front, i take down the guy behind him. and it makes return fire even harder because the guys in the back of the line have to fire through their own men at the enemy. see what i mean? it's fatal. you know, i'm gonna wait for you outside. it shouldn't be long. come in, dr. gallagher. gallagher, how's our boy? our boy hasn't the faintest idea who you are. well, it's a big army. there was no insurance inquiry. are you accusing me of something, doctor? well...you're keeping your eye on clay long after his discharge. what do you want, rawlins? i just want clay and his family to have a good life. he's earned it. that's all? this is satellite imagery of the baghdad neighborhood where clay and his men were attacked -- one taken shortly before, the other just after. no explanation? by helping you, i hope to help clay. he may have a decision to make. regarding what? jack, meet moon. nice to meet you, sir. you, too. private -- just moon will do. moon, what do you think of lieutenant jefferson? he's very cool for an oer. when i was hit, he was right there. lieutenant's good people. lieutenant bostock -- sonny? good people, excellent. now, nobody likes to talk ill of the dead, of course. that's right. you know, we're both doctors, though, so whatever you say is completely confidential. we're trying to help lieutenant jefferson. he's having a hard time. james: florida. there's a facility very near our home, extremely highly rated, also near the beach. and your mom and i would be 10 minutes away. when you come to visit, you stay with us. there's a guest room. but best of all, as becky progresses, if they let her out on weekends, she could come home. before any of this happens, we'd like you to check out the facility and consult with the doctors. we'd rely on you. well, this is, uh...unexpected. [ sighs ] she's our daughter, jack. we -- we've talked about this for years. it was a major factor in buying our home and locating where we did. why didn't you tell me about this? it's just speculation. we had no way of knowing under what circumstances becky would be found, or even if. i don't know. i -- this is gonna take me a little bit of time to -- how lore you guys in town? jack. please don't just reject this suggestion out of hand. i'm not gonna reject anything...yet. look, i realize that we've sprung this on you, but it deserves serious consideration. and i'll give it serious consideration. look...guys, really, i've -- i've got an early start in the morning, and it's getting late. can i call you back? yeah, okay, thank you. i need legal advice. okay, i know a number of good attorneys. just listen for a minute. okay. they want to take becky back to florida and put her in treatment there. and i think they have becky's power of attorney, authorizing themo make medical decisions on her behalf. and you want to fight that? how do i keep her in california? um, get becky to revoke the power of attorney, file suit on her behalf. your medical credentials should help your case. she's here now. it's gonna take some time for your parents to get a court to act. by that time, hopefully, she'll be settled into a facility that you've chosen. i need those names. how do you think the stress of a legal battle will affect becky? maybe she doesn't have to know about that part. it could get pretty ugly. it'll be what it is. why else did you build it, clay, if not for this? it ends here. sonny! [ explosion ] man: man, we got to go! that's the last thing i remember. maybe these will help. that's right there was...a home. i ran through it a thousand times. i couldn't figure how i could let us get caught out in the open like that. ???? neither. the explosion. i thought it killed sonny. that was his grenade. man: move! get inside now. what did you see? bodies. mostly women and kids. moon told us that on a previous mission, it seems sonny rolled a grenade into a house without looking inside to see who was there. sonny was firing into the bodies... sonny! what are you doing?! ...making sure they were dead. there was a boy, maybe... maybe 5 or 6. blood on his face. sonny put his rifle to the boy's head. i tried to stop him. don't do it, sonny. i killed my best friend. you knew what i did all along? nope. no one else was inside the room. and now that you do... you can't tell anyone? patient/doctor thing. right. but i can. we thought laney should hear this, too. we filled her in on some of the background. so, here's what we got from moon. soon after you entered the house, reinforcements arrived, and the enemy fire melted away. that's when rawlins showed up, went inside where you were. and no one else was allowed inside the house. i remember. he -- um, he ordered me to carry on, said there'd have to be an investigation. sometime after that, a car showed up. someone handed rawlins some gear in a duffel bag, and he went back into the house. when he came out, the duffel was empty. i saw the detonator. that's when you went running back to the place. i thought the boy was still in there. no. he'd already been medevacked out. and the whole place was vaporized -- no more building. that was the second explosion, the one that caused your injuries. and the amnesia? post-traumatic stress disorder. it's all over, baby, okay? it's for the army to decide. nathan. these little fellas are for you. come here. here you go. come here. come here. there you go. attaboy. but if it were nathan? what? what if it were an unnamed soldier... aiming the gun at nathan's head? would you really condemn the man that saved your son? come here. no crimicharges filed. he'll receive outpatient therapy. he has decided, for the good of his family, to let the past stay in the past. case closed. you knew the story all along. we both got to the same place by different roads. someday, god willing, we'll make it so that good men like clay jefferson will never again be placed in impossible situations. until then, i'll look for small victories. come here. that's it. i've got you. ææàãðü×öä»×é -==http://www.ragbear.com==-
