His handiwork, i assume. mahatma gallagher. He mentioned something about shintoism. celebration of nature's spirits and ancestors. Nice touch. So, what's his story, anyway ? What do you mean? Divorced, attached, fugitive from the law, c.i.a. mole ? He's currently uttached, severe commitment disorder, exercise junkie, peter pan syndrome. Not that i've paid much attention. He has a seriously smokinbody. Not that i've noticed. Hey, guys. beautiful day, isn't it? So... Are you ready for some patient-doctor bonding ? Well, 're waiting for rounds. we just need to get in six north. - Great, then... - And the director usually accompanies us on the rounds. Gotcha. - Doctor, i need a little help. - Talk to me, gorgeous. Ranier, Melissa. Third trimester. Here visiting relatives. She was alone shopping at the grove when she jusstarted having contractions and faied. just took her b.p. she's slightly hypertensive. okay. thank you. You busy later ? But i'm pretty sure you're not. I'm dr. moore. How are you doing? I started getting contractions, and...then i got so light-headed. i'm only seven months. i'm so scared. Is my baby okay ? well, let's take a look. where are the patients? What's going on ? relay races? is this supposed to take the place of morning rounds? Of course not. rounds are good. Actually, veronica, instigating a morning fitness regime is not a bad idea. exercise has been shown to elevate brain-derived neurotrophic factors. right, but this more than encouraging the patients to work out. this is a trust exercise. trusting other patients? no. trusting their doctors. the three-legged race is up next. wait. hey... we're... you mean we're supposed to...? you can't be serious ! actually, it looks like fun. unfortunately, my back. i'm in heels. guys, whether these patients are here on a 72-hour hold or they've committed themselves voluntarily, they've all put their well-being in our hands. if they don't believe that you're willing to get down and dirty with them, how can you expect them to confide in you? and, people, this is not a suggestion. this is gonna be a little cold, and i'm sorry. it's okay. i've done this a million times. i'm gonna get you something to stop those contractions, ok ? back in a flash. Ready ! on your mark! Set ! races ? it's cool. i just called you. i need you down at the e.r. for a psych consult. really? yeah. absolutely. let's go. so, what's up? we, this patient informed us she was seven months along. she fainted when contractions started. she has hormone levels that are raised and cervical softening. well, then why -- why are you asking for a psych consult? call an ob-gyn. take a look at the ultrasound. what's wrong with this picture? i don't get it. i can't even see a baby. there is no baby. Pseudocyesis Is she still pregnacy ? is she still in the e.r.? - I ordere some blood work. - Why ? just to buy some time. i read about this in med school, but i never thought i would actually see it firsthand. and she actually looks pregnant? Not just looks. she has all the classic mptoms right down to hormonal levels, water retention. the mind speaks. the body answers. But for seven months ? is there a husband? she's wearing a ring. So, what should  do with her? well, i told her there was no room in maternity. i just -- i wasn't sure how far to push at the intake. we should go easy on her. something tells me we shouldn't burst her bubble just yet. Let's get her to the psych ward. is there any other business ? want to grab some breakfast? i'm buying. thanks. I have a budget meeting. try not to, piss anybody important off today. - really go... - he baby cakes. Denny. what's going on? what's going on? it's thursday. i have a standing engagement at the hospital, remember? yeah, i blew it off. you know, i'd much rather play for the kids here. what's the matter? what about those producers you said were really hot? those guys are all the same. they're all part of the same corporate machine. they make a ton of promises, and they never deliver. so, what? you want me to go? no. i just -- i just question your priorities. that's all. hey, if you think i'm being irresponsible, jt say so. hey, we'll set you up outside. i'll call down to pediatrics, let them know you're here. great. thanks, malcolm. i got to go. you gonna come by later and hear me play? yeah, if i can. so, i understand you're from out of town. yes. florence, arizona. and we're here visiting my husband's family. how long have you been married? it'll be two years this spring. is this your first pregnancy? yes. and... have you... have you picked out a name ? - Sean. - Oh, that's nice. tell me, melissa, have you experienced any other discomfort during your pregnancy -- morning sickness, spotting? no. actually, everything's been pretty easy up until this trip. were you working when you got pregnant? yes. i was waitressing when i met richard. we started dating. we went on this whirlwind trip around europe. we got married at the hotel cipriani. - That's in venice. - Yes. it's a beautiful hotel. isn't it? And... well, a month later... we both wanted a big family. i come from one. richard's an only child. - Is richard on his way here? - Yes. they called him from the e.r. and left him a message. he'll be here soon. can you hold on a minute? the -- excuse me. - sure. - i'll be back very soon. becky, hold on a minute. the reception is no good inside. do you have any children? oh, well, i'm -- i'm -- my husnd and i have talked about it, of course, and, uh, even though the clock is ticking -- and it's ticking -- there just never seemed to be the perfect time. is he a doctor, too? no. he's a... musician. oh, wow! how wonderful! what does he play? the piano, jazz piano, and he composes, too. must be amazing to have talent like that. i wish i did. we've been playing beethoven and bach sonatas for the baby. oh, that's nice. so, melissa... do you have the name of your ob-gyn at home so we can get in contact with him or her? actually, it's richard, my husband. okay. he's got the whole world in his hands he's got the whole wide world in his hands he's got the whole world in his hands he's got the whole world... Thanks for not hanging up. i'm outside in the garden area. it's really nice. there's jasmine here, beck, loads of it. it's a bit like the isle of wight. do you remember? you said you loved the smell and you never wanted to leave. rebecca, you know, i was thinking... it would be really nice if you could stop by. We could... he's got the whole world in his hands he's got the whole world in his hands he's got you and me brother, in his hands he's got you and me, brother, in his hands he's got you and me, brother, in his hands he's got the whe world in his hands</u> he's got the whole world in his ha-a-nds All right ! it's the perfect alibi. what is? well, having your husband as your ob-gyn. that's assuming her husband actually exists. it could be just another delusion. well, we'll know soon enough. dr. delusion is on his way over here. it's just so sad, i mean, believing you're about to give birth when you're not. it's also incredible. cessation of the menstrual cycle, abdominal enlargement, breast enlargement, quickening galactorrhea, cervical softening, uterine enlargement. yeah, but how is it possible that the abdominal enlargement is so massive? excess bowel gas, uterine distensi, bladder retention. could be aot of things. but she's not gonna be able to keep this up much longer. Help ! Help ! My water just broke ! Hey Melissa, feeling better ? yes. thank you. I told you already ! i'm looking for my wife !</i> oh, Richard ! oh, thank god you're here ! i'm so sorry. are you okay? yes. She's fine now, mr. Ranier. I'm dr. Hayden-Jones. it's dr. ranier. who's in charge here? you're the idiot who put my wife in the psych ward? what the hell is wrong with you people? i want her transferred. i need an sma 20, cbcc, beta-hch, and an abdominal ultrasound stat! why are you just standing there? my wife is seven months pregnant ! this baby could be in distress ! have you all lost your minds ? i need to speak to the hospital administrator. now! Good idea. I'll call her. stay with them. are you okay? yes. - Yes ? You feel all right ? - I'm so glad you're here. you look so beautiful. no way. this guy's legit. Dr. Richard Ranier licensed physician with an impeccable reputation. i suppose it's possible he never examined his own wife. she told me she'd been under his care exclusively. she's allegedly had regular checkups. i mean, she'even had amnio. and we're absolutely sure that she's not pregnant? yes, carl, we're sure. how could he have lied to her for seven months? probably kept her pretty isolated. so, now what? well, i'll tell you one thing, he's not gonna let us hold his wife without a fight. so, don't fight it. in a couple of months, they'll figure out the wholthing for themselves without our interference. it's not interference, carl. it's called treatment. just let them go! Nice, carl, let her give birth, raise the kid, send it off to college, and sit back and wait for the imaginary grandkids. oh. he's screaming his head off and asking for you again. Well, might as well face the music. pure folly to keep this farce alive. you're a gens, carl. pure folly. that's exactly what it is. followy lead. i'll follow you anywhere. because that very important person you weren't supposed to piss off today... that would be me. i am so sorry for all the confusion, dr. ranier. i'm nora skoff, departmental administrator. we, of course, welcome all visiting physicians to whartonemorial, and i promise you will receive the full measure of our professional courtesy. the maternity ward, unfortunately, remains full. are those her tests? the, fetus does not appear to be in distress, and... i can assure you that the birth is not imminent. there's been no dilation. well, the blood work can't be right. melissa said that you did an ultrasound? yeah. thank you. whoever did this ultrasound is a moron. the image is so blurred, it's useless. i-i personally did an ultrasound on melissa just days ago. I have it. Here it is. okay. there you go. sweetheart, i am so sorry that i couldn't get here earlie it's okay. i'm fine. the baby's fine. i just -- i lost control of my bladder, and i thought that my water had broken. it happens. sweetheart, there's no reason to be ashamed. come here. it's a good thing that your water didn't break. it's too soon. the baby is protected. and there's no chance for infection. sean is healthy and happy. what you need now is rest. i'll make the arrangements to take you home. i'll be right back. well, my wife has had quite a scare, but i know her very well, and she's ready to travel now. so, if you'll just give me the release forms... actually, we'd like to keep her overnight - Just as a precaution. - No. no, i've already put up with what i consider to be gross incompetence on behalf of this hospital. that ultrasound was shoddy. You're absolutely right. let's schedule another one tomorrow morning. and there are liability issues. i'm sure you can understand, doctor. fine. fine. i'll do the ultrasound myself... Today. excuse me. may i? i'd rather you didn't. i'm expecting a call any minute. no. i don't mind. hey, honey. i'm just taking a quick lunch break. how did the opening go? that's great. i miss you, too. is it snowing there? perfect. t weather's always perfect here. but it's not new york. i know. i can't wait. i got to go, too. i'll call you later. love you. long-distance romance... doomed to failure. unless... unless what? you have a lot of meaningless but hot sex with skilled but emotnally detached partners. i'm available. arturo, seriously, what do you think is gonna happen here? seriously, i think that you're gonna come to your senses and realize... do you honestly believe that you're the personal panacea to my lesbianism, that i'm suddenly gonna realize i'm straight and want to jump on top of you? Yeah. One night. that's all it'll take. maybe two. i can work with you on that. stand up. stand up. drop your pants. i want to see it. show me what i'm missing. rock my world. not that i'm shy, honey, and god knows i had no reason to be, but... That would be highly unprofessional. Exactly. Unprofessional. like you coming on to me at every opportunity. there. there's the head. it's beautiful. melissa, look! look! there's a hand. healthy heartbeat. healthy fetus. okay. get dressed. we're leaving. i'm sorry, doctor, but i can't allow your wife to leave just yet. you don't have that authority. i absolutely do. - We're leaving. - No, you're not. Melissa's my wife, Ok ? you don't tell me at to do! melissa is your wife, but this is my ward. i say when a patient's discharged. security ! will he live ? probably, but he's never gonna play the trumpet again. glad you guys are enjoying this. you did say he wouldn't leave without a fight. you're fine. later, slugger. doctor, that thing you asked me about earlier. the thing... oh, no. i'll... i'll find you. security is holding him. he's claiming self-defense. yeah, right. and just so as we're clear, if he hadn't sucker punched me, i could ha taken him easy. Jack, you can press charges. no... no. come on. the guy's got enough problems. you're right. Folie à deux. translation from the french, "folly for two"... "a rare shared psychotic disorder "when an otherwise healthy person, - The secondary partner..." - Melissa. "...begins believing the delusions "of someone with whom they have a close relationship, - The primary partner..." - Richard. "...who is already suffering from a psychotic disorder with prominent delusions." So, melissa believed she was pregnant, and he came to believe it, as well? other way around. richard's the primary. he convinced her she was pregnant. he was her doctor. so she had no reason to question him. took the bait. She's got a bun in the oven. if richard's the dominant partner, then melissa's delusion's more fragile. easier to convince that the baby's not there. and with richard, it's gonna be a lot more tricky. but why? what put this in motion? melissa couldn't get pregnant, so he just invented it? that is exactly the right question. why don't you grab chloe and do some digging? i can't keep doing this. i can't keep being here and going home to denny. you know that. if you say so. i really mean it this time. it's over. you don't believe me, do you? no. Dr. ranier quit hipractice in phoenix seven months ago, presumably when he found out his wife was pregnant. he told everyone that he wanted to spend every moment with melissa until she gave birth to ensure the health of their child. according to phoenix general, the ultrasound richard gave you is not two days old but almost two years old. so, this ultrasound... It's not hers. melissa told me and veronica this was her first child. but she also said she got pregnant about a month after her honeymoon, which was almost two years ago. looks like whave some more digging to do. goody-goody. hey, wendy. how are you doing? do you think you might be able to put your head underwater today? Aquaphobic. Selachophobic. oh, i-i don't think so. well, that's okay. that's okay. you can always try again tomorrow. ultrasound taken two years ago, definitely hers. she has a child? it was never carried to term. it was a molar twin. oh, god. when did you give melissa the neuroleptic? about an hour ago. it should be working by now. good. well, when you're done here, let's go have a chat with her. Heard about the <i>folie à deux.</i> interesting, huh? very. spoke to nora about possibly writing up a journal article. it's good advertising for the hospital. Taking one for the team ? Actually, if i were the attending, i might proceed a little differently. you see, the first thing i'd do is i'd separate them. the husband and the wife, they're just finding off of each other, merging in their... mania. under some circumstances, you might be right, but not this time. well, you are in charge. Yeah. I'am. Hi, melissa. How are you feeling ? sleepy. And... I'm a little warm. that's the medication we gave you. it's supposed to relax you a little bit. do you remember when we asked you if this was your first pregnancy ? yes. actually... ...there was another, but i'd rather not talk about it. we know what happened, melissa. richard was so happy. i got pregnant right after we got married. this isn't his first marriage. he tried with his ex-wife... but she couldn't conceive. you should have seen his face... when the tests came back. all his life, he delivered babies. Now... He's finally gonna have one of his own. i lost this baby, too, didn't i? this time... there was no baby. it's okay, melissa. Molar pregnancy. It's pretty horrific. two sperm fertilize the same egg, producing one healthy fetus and one mass of cells without the genetic material to form one. and that mass of cells growing quickly can overwhelm the healthy fetus, literally devouring it. that would shake anybody's world. it unhinged richard. that's for sure. i'd say that's what set all this in motion. if his delusion is so deep-seated, how are you gonna break it ? i'll think of something. why does that not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling? can you hang on a minute? rebecca, i'm inside. i can't hear you. damn it. she's still calling. you'll find her. is my husband still being held in security? yes, he is. you know, maybe you should press charges. maybe he belongs in jail. look what he d to me. he wasn't just my husband. he was my doctor! i mean, he knew i would believe what he told me. i'm so stupid. i guesthat's what he was depending on. he's incapable of depending on anything... even his own mind. he wants a baby very badly. and that's not such a bad thing to want. he divorced his first wife because she couldn't give him what he wanted. he married me... A younger woman, A breeder, 'cause he was sure i could do better. he doesn't love me. of course he does. all this is just a product of his disease. to him, this all seems very, very real. no. he doesn't love me. he loves the baby more. that's not true. let me prove it to you. i regret... no time for that now, richard. thank you. it's okay. melissa's having contractions again, and she's hypertensive. the baby's in distress and needs to come out now. where is she? she's in the o.r. being prepped for an emergency c-section. we have an anesthesiologist and a surgeon on standby. i presume you want to be present at the delivery? Yes. yeah, ye... of course. I-i'll scrub in. you okay? i'm gonna be a father. why so happy, arturo? dr. gallagher has invited us to be present at the delivery of the ranier baby. the imaginary ranier baby? yeah. that's the one. Well better i get going later. are you aware of what's abouto happen? vaguely. and you intend to let him proceed? for now. have you anticipated what the board's reaction will be to this Ill-conceived charade ? i dn't planned on discussing it with the board. are you suggesting that i should? undoubtedly, someone will. i'm trying to protect you, nora. ani appreciate that, carl. thank you for your support. you put more than your reputation on the line when you hired him. - Whatever do you mean ? - You know what i mean. i seriously doubt you can handle that kind of financial hit. how did you find that out? do you honestly believe thers anything going on in this hospital that i don't know about? i suppose not. is that all? no. are we ready? yes, doctor. is the fetal heart monitor on? yes, doctor. stabilized, 2 mics per kilo. perhaps you'd like to make the first incision. You're going to feel sleepy now. just wait. we can't wait. richard, the baby's in distress. it needs to come out now. Check the heart monitor and the fetal monitor.</i> something's not -- it's not right here. this is what you wanted. make the incision. no. no, no, no, no. please stop. just stop. it's not right. please. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. It's okay. It's over now. i would never let anyone hurt you. Never. I love you. Delusional. Shared Psychotic Disorder. "Folie à Deux". I love you, too. Dr. ranier voluntarily committed himself? He knows he's sick. Worst part's over. You aren't gonna say anything ? About what ? About the fact that you booked a working o.r. at the cost of thousands of dollars and were about to perform an unauthorized c-section? That you had real surgical instruments in the room and tried to put a deadly weapon in the hands of a mentally ill person? No. I'm sorry i'm late. I got something i want you to listen to. Is that new ? Wrote it for you. We talk about social imperfections...</u> Is... is everything okay, baby ? God, denny. I-i...i don't know what to say. I... I was so mad when you came by today, and i... and then i just saw you with the kids, and... they're great kids. you know, maybe -- I don't know, maybe we should start having some of our own. You'd make a great mom. and it's me that wants it all to be now</u> to be somehow cause it's me that wants it all Wharton memorial. Dr. gallagher. here. - Yes. - Thanks, mal. She... she has been admitted. Look, i assure you... - Who left this ? - A lady. She asked if you were here and dropped it off. - When ? - A couple of minutes ago. What was she wearing ? Damn it, malcolm. this is important. what was she wearing ? I'm sorry. I was so bus i didn't even notice. S-sorry. I'm so sorry.
