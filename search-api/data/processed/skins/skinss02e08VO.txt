{\a3}You're my girlfriend! {\a3}- And you're my best friend. - Tony, I love her. {\a3}No, you don't. He loves Cassie. {\a3}I love you. {\a3}<i>I love you too.</i> {\a3}Are you the only person in the world that's been let down? {\a3}Are you? {\a3}Can't you forgive me? {\a3}I've had my pain, Jal. {\a3}Yours is in the post. JAL OK, here we go. Chris. I've got something to tell you. I'm pregnant. I wanna keep the baby. Is that OK? Chris, I've got something to tell you. I'm pregnant. I'm gonna have an abortion. Is that OK? Chris. I'm pregnant. What d'you think? Sigmund... Freud... What the fuck did he do? Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Oh, blast! I'm actually fucked. Ignorance is fucking bliss, man. I was fine before. I was totally fine before I started revising. Now look at me. Fuck this shit. I'm bellin' some beanies, man. Thank you, Kenneth. Thank you everybody, a little attention, please! Anwar, boyo, shut it! Yes, thank you, Doug. No problem. You may be wondering... You may be wondering what happened to study leave. Well. Never, in my 25 years as a teacher, have I come across a year 13 so utterly catastrophically, terminally stupid. And that is why study leave has been abolished. Kids. If you're not going to do it for yourselves, do it for us. Please! From now on... it's revision on the premises. 9 til 4.30. No excuses, no exceptions or you're expelled. We will be centre of excellence if it kills me. Got it? Screw you lives up in your own time! - Hello? - Hi, it's Shaniqua, you pussy-hole. Where are you? - Just hold on one moment. - <i>It's Shaniqua.</i> With an N and an A and a Q near the end. Remember?</i> - Shaniqua? - Yeah, Shaniqua. Yo. Javon, didn't I expell you? Basketball team made it to the quarterfinals. Jesus Christ. Doug? What's that about? No study leave? I'm a man about the town. I had appointments. Yeah. I wanted to go to Thorpe Park. Alright, settle down, let's not panic. We've still got... five days before exams, kids. Come on, let me hear you. Oggy oggy oggy! Chelle. I need to speak to you. Jal? Have you made your decision? You have to be honest with yourself, Jal. Honesty is the best policy. - You think? - I do think. Have you told the father? Have you told anyone? Jal, very soon, your body's going to change. I know, and I'm gonna make a choice. I am. Hi Chris. Shit. Sorry, I lost track of time. - Um, I'm at the bank. - <i>What you doing at the bank?</i> Banking. I'm cooking for you. Hurry up. I'll be there soon. Yeah? Bye. When? Soon. Honest. You've got a lot to carry. I'm used to it. Got a lot of revision. Clarinet's not heavy. I don't mean your bags. I'm used to it. Take these and read them carefully, OK? What does that mean? "What would Jesus do?" Oh, why you crying now? Oh, shit. Amerie! Give it back! You fucking give Usher his lolly back, now! NOW! Get up. Pick your stuff up. Come on, move, you dozy cow. Posh bitch. And... open. It's your favourite. What is? Eggy bread! Oh, right. Why is it black? I prefer the term "African-American". You're something else. Let me see what we have here. Chateauneuf de lager. Yeah? Let's get you some of that, then. For you, madame. Chris, I've got something to tell you. Cool. Me too. I got you a present! Hey? Cut this morning while you were at the bank. Right, I know it might seem a bit fast, but, well, I think we're ready, so, er, Jal... I want you to move in with me. - What? - I want your stuff to be in this house. Yeah? What could be better than that? What did you wanna tell me? I love you. Hey, now you're talking. I was thinking... Don't think. Sorry. Not again. Please, Jal, not again. You can't walk me to the lake and then not let the camel drink. I'm fucking thirsty. I can't. What the fuck's going on? I feel like I'm giving you everything, but... Sorry. Not even a cheeky foot-job? Ainsley. Ainsley. Gordon...! Man, you're gonna burn it, man. What's the matter with you? Blud, I put in too much olive oil. You don't listen, do you? Cooking oil only. Olive oil is for special foods like omelettes. Hi, Dad. Look what the cat dragged in. Yo, Jal. Come do some pancakeage innit. Where you been? Out. I know you been out. I'm saying, where you been? Well? With Chris. You've got exams and an audition coming up. Forget about him, the boy's a waster. He's not a waster. He's a drugged-up, good-for-nothing waster. Anyone can see you won't end up with him. How d'you know? - It's not gonna happen. - Yeah? And you know all about relationships, Dad, don't you? Oi! Who saw me flippage? Eh, it's like doing crack, innit? Eh, Wilbur, where my gold star, man? - Shush, man. - Yo, but that was... I said shush! You look me in the eye and swear to me this boy won't mess you up somehow. Why don't you get a life of your own and stay out of mine, OK Hey, Ronnie. Come get some pancakes, man. Huh? What you saying? Lemon, chocolate, butter...? I can't. Can I? Hello? Morning, Jal. Hi Cass. It's not the morning, by the way. Does it matter? Needed somewhere quiet to revise. Well. It's quiet, isn't it? I haven't spoken to you in such a long time, Jal. Gotta revise, Cass. It's not like you need to. Forget the books. Let's talk. - What about? - I dunno. Fill me in with everything. Every little detail. There's nothing really to talk about. I'm really happy, Jal. Things worked out for once. Isn't that great? - Sid? - He just left. We've been getting to know each other again. A lot. Cool. And it's lovely having someone who cares about you. All the worries feel lighter when you've got someone you can tell everything to. Yeah? We can carry on pretending, if it makes you feel any better. Treat it like a role play. I love drama. What? Do you wanna play Jal, or should I? Shut up, Cassie. I'm trying to revise here. I've got so much to do, so little time. Revision, even though I'm going to music college, I can't help myself. I've gotta revise, cos it takes my mind off being pregnant. What?! All these books. Stops me thinking about anything. Stops me thinking about why I'm keeping a secret from my boyfriend. Please... Or my best friends. Please don't tell, Cass. Secrets hurt. It's only a matter of time before you and Chris know everything about each other, Jal. And there's a lot of secrets out there. Breakfast? Bye. Hey, I'm home. Who's my babe? Oi! Get back to class! Thank you. Very good. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Ah... Go back to sleep, man. - Maxxie! - All right, guys? Max. Over here. I saved you a seat. Um, I want you guys to meet someone. James. James. Yeah, man. It's James. Everyone knows James, man. Sit down. Hey. James. You can use my book, yeah? Yeah, OK. Nice one. Cheers, mate. So. James. What's he like? He's good. Really good. That's cool. Hey. There she is. There's such a shenanigans ting, bruv. Make a man horny and ting. {\a7}Blood! Bare linkages like. What's going on? Hey, Jal, how's the revision? Chelle, can we go outside for some fresh air? Chelle. Chelle, I need to... What? What does fucking "embarazada" mean? Shit, I've gotta revise. I'm never gonna pass. Michelle. Can you just stand still and... Carry your books? I haven't got any books, Tony. They're in the study room. Let's go get them. Then I'll carry them. I know I should talk to Chris. It's just... Telling him will make it real and you'll have to decide. You need some time out. This is where I come for a bit of peace and quiet. Come on. Hey, Bob. Hey, Gretel! Not seen you for a bit. Oh, wow. Well, I finally got it together with that Sinbad guy - I was telling you about. - Sinbad? Thought he'd never pull it together. Lucky Sinbad. Bob, this is Esmeralda, but everyone calls her Alda. It's her first time here. She's into Lady Luck. Well, then. There's something for nothing. Take a chance. Thanks. Alda? You can pull any face behind a mask. But be careful. Why? Because someone else might be pretending. You might not be the only one with a secret. Cass. For Christ's sakes! Whoo! I win, motherfucker! How often do you come here? Don't you get it, Alda? This is nowhere. Nothing matters here. That's what you want, isn't it? I don't know. Go on. See how your luck's running. Win means you decide one way. Lose, and you decide another. You decide. Wow! A golden one! You win. So what's the decision, Alda? Jal, blud! Come tru man! Family meeting. I know your parents have gone to Blackpool for the week, but you're not my family, Donald. We all started in Africa. We callin' this family meeting, cos we, the hip-hop collective, is making an official announcement. Basically we're not in da rap thing any more. Na. We is going into business, maa-aan! I told you, Ronnie, these guys would grow out of the rap ting. This time next week, they'll wanna be reggae selectas. Don't watch. Man's trying to build a new kind of empire, you get me? The clothing revolution starts here! We goin' all out. World domination! See, we caterin' for everyone in da market! We got tees for da crips, the bloods, and da gay mandem. They're da only people in da market. With the exclusive... Do You clothing range! So, how you gonna pay for all this? Well, Pops, you'd come tru with da dolla, you get me? You want me to invest in your T-shirt business? Sho old man. And the record label! We're taking over and ting. Oh, shit. Now they're back in the music business! We already got a showerman artist. - Shower shower shower shower! - Yeah? Who? Zoop-zoop! Do you familia! You're bad jokers, man. So all I need, my favourite Papa Was a Preacher Man to do is... Sign da six figure deal. What you saying, Jal? Do I sign? Or am I in over my head? I'm pregnant. Bloodfire! You have two new messages. Jal, where are you? I wanna talk to you. Call me.</i> Next message. Hi, Jal. OK, so I looked it up in the Spanish dictionary.</i> Ring me. Ring me, Jal, please. Sit down. I said sit. Give me the plan. Move in with Chris? Have a kid? Have a couple? Maybe. - Look at me. - I don't want to. You fucking look at me! Dad! It's simple. You either fuck up your life or you don't. You've got an audition, music college. Everything you've been working for, everything I've been paying for! - I'm not going to that audition. - Why? I can't even look at you right now. I'm... disappointed. Disappointed? OK, I'm a big fat disappointment! Yeah, you are! Jesus! Why are you doing this to me? - Stop it. - If your mother was here... Oh! Well, I'd like to see that! But she's not here, she won't set foot in this place! You did something, you fucked up so bad, and one day we're gonna find out what you did. - I don't know what I did. - Crap! What would my mum say, Dad? Where is my mum? Shut your mouth! Where is she?! No! What would my mum say, Dad? Come back here! Yo... Uncle Lynton in the house! Go away. It's blessed. What you bawlin' for? Got a young blood nephew passing through We're already feeling it still. I love you guys. Gimme some of that love. I never clocked how lucrative the "Do You" baby range could be. You all right? I thought you were coming round last night. Yeah, sorry. Cassie says that I should to talk to you. I can't. I've gotta go to London for my audition and back for my oral. I know, but you need to hear this. - No. - I waited for you and... Not now! Hold on, look, listen... What are we waiting for? Come and live with me. We're gonna run out of time if you don't stand still... I've gotta go. I'm gonna be late. Yeah, I know. You... You know? I know that if you go to that audition, then you'll get in, and then, sooner or later, we'll be over. You don't know what you're talking about. No? Look, my pad's this way. My music audition. Don't go. - What?! - I need ya. - It's not like I've got in yet. - You'll get in! And then you'll probably move in with some fucking music student called Terry from East Anglia, who blows a fucking trombone, and then you'll sit up discussing your blowing techniques, - then you'll blow him. - Huh? And I fucking love you. Yeah, you'll move in with him and I could be, like, dying, yeah, and you wouldn't even know about it. I'm just going to an audition. Then we're gonna talk, Chris. Wish me luck. Luck. All right, no blowing trombones, then, yeah? Yeah. Jalanda Fazer. Which of the four pieces are you playing for us today? The Brahms. Brahms? A bit of a cop out. Cop out? It's the easiest piece out of the four, and we're about challenge. - We need to know if you are, too. - But... So we'll give the Weber a crack, unless you feel you aren't up to it. Oh, let her play the easy piece. I'll play the fucking Weber. What are you lookin' at? Hi, Cassie. Hi, Chelle. Um... I was just wondering if Jal was here. Thought we could go to the oral together. She's not here. - OK? - Cassie. - Has she told him yet? - It's none of our business, Chelle. Look, I want to talk to him. Chris went to bed. He's not feeling well again. She'll be at the oral. She always does what she's supposed to do. Look, Cassie... I'm really sorry about me and Sid. He saw sense. I'm glad. Good luck, Chelle. Hello? Hello, Jalanda. Mum? Is this real? Everything's real, darling. You'd better tuck in before Ace and Lynton come. You won't be here when Ace and Lynton come. Sit down. I hear you've got a boyfriend. Who said...? Right, Dad told you. Ronnie tells me a lot of things. No, he doesn't. He doesn't talk about you, you don't exist for him. Well, you know all about it, don't you? Dad wouldn't. He hates you. One thing I know for certain about Ronnie is that he doesn't hate me. Jalanda, there is a reason for everything. Whatever you do now about this baby... will have a reason. You'll understand it, maybe nobody else will. But you can live with that, can't you? Where the fuck were you?! I remember standing... in this kitchen one Tuesday. I scraped sauce off Lynton's coat and wiped snot off Ace's knee. And I re-did the plaits in your hair. And I watched you go off to school. And I knew that your Dad was coming in from the afternoon flight from New York. We needed you. I couldn't stand that. It was easy to go upstairs and pack a bag, walk to the bus stop, get on. I had some choices. I had some choices, and that's what I did. Did you know the maximum text charge from one mobile phone network to another is 30p? And you couldn't even spare 30 fucking pence to check I was OK, to say happy birthday! Talking now is gonna achieve what? Tell me, because my network's fucking cheap! You made your choice. - Jalanda... - It's Jal. Jalanda... The one thing that your father couldn't forgive was... I wasn't honest. I didn't tell him. That was all. You'd better go before Ace and Lynton get back. Bueno. Jalanda... Jalanda. Chris? I've been trying to call you! Where the fuck have you been? Well, they had coffee, but I thought these looked so vibrant I couldn't resist. Cassie, nothing's making sense. I couldn't choose a flavour, so the man suggested we had lucky dip, like a thunderball. Mmm, guava... With a hint of papaya... Cassie, what's wrong with Chris? So refreshing. I can feel the steel drums chiming against my taste buds. Cassie. I don't want to play any more! What the fuck's going on? I told you. He had a headache. Said he'd just nip down to the hospital. Nip? To the hospital? What's wrong with him? What if I just told him your secret? What? You're not the only one, Jal. What are you on about, Cass? Chris doesn't have secrets. I know all there is to know... You never saw the pills? Chris is always taking pills and I'm always telling him to stop, but... Not those kind. The kind that you're supposed to take. Why? Because there's something wrong with you. What kind of pills, Cassie? He fell on the floor, Jal. There was blood in his ear. I didn't know what to do. Cassie Ainsworth? - Is there a Cassie Ainsworth here? - Here. This way, please. Why are they asking for you? He'll have to explain. He can't do anything else now. Go on. I keep stepping on mines, Cass. I know. Chris? Are you the girlfriend? Good. He's nearly gone. What? Where? Premeds. He'll be out in a minute. Go on. Have a chat. Chris. What's wrong? The sky is blue and the grass is green. Good mood shit. Everything's... Everything's cool. What pills do you take? Everything. I stick the packets on the wall. What pills?! It's a secret. No-one knows. Don't tell Jal cos... then if you tell Jal... ... she won't move in with me any more. I'm pregnant. I might have to have a baby. Or I might have to... I might want... Why is he like that? It's probably a mixture of the premeds for the operation... What operation? The swelling on his brain caused by the clot isn't doing him any good, though. That's why we've decided to keep him under until... The doctor explained all this to you. It's marked as "Girlfriend spoke to doctor". You said you knew about this because of the hereditary aspect. The brother. The brother died of the same thing. What's happening? What are they doing? Chris. Chris?! Oh, my God, can you hear me, Chris?! Out! What's wrong?! What's wrong with him?! Calm down! Tell me what's wrong with him. Where's he going? Where are you taking him? Where's he going? Chris! Come on. Get off, get off me! Any... Any chance of a cheeky foot job? This is all my luck. It's all I got. transcripts.subtitle.me.uk Sync: Nathbot {\a3}You may turn over your papers. {\a3}- I'll love you forever, Sid. - You will? {\a3}Yes. That's the problem. {\a3}I fucked up.
