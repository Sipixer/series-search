It was... before i found out you had sex with my boyfriend the best friend and the boyfriend-- That's pretty classy, s. 365 DAYS You'd really go out with some guy you don't know? - Well, he can't be worse than the guys i do know. - Well, our kids were bound to meet. It's a small island. Are you sure it's s t some ploy you're using to get to me? A WHOLE SEASON OF INTRIGUE * make it through that way * - Did you sleep with her, huh? - I know how long you and i have been best friends, okay? No, it's not okay, chuck. From now on, you stay away from me. - Did something happen last night? - Yes. - I'm done. - I lied, and i stole, And i lost the respect of my family... for what? I tried to warn you. There's a price to pay. Lily, would you do me the honor of being my wife? He proposed before we left, and i'm going to say yes. One thing i learned is That in the face of true love, you don't just give up, - Even if the object of your affection is begging you to - i'm not who you thought i was, and you can't forgive that. I don't know how to make things go back to what they were. I'm locking myself away in the hamptons. - You know how i get ??? in the summer. - Yeah, i do.

I had my eye on her. - I-I don't think she noticed, sir. - Read from your favorite chapter. - Or did you not notice? - Uh, you know, i've heard that chapter so many times, Sometimes i think i wrote it myself. Speaking of, where is that story of yours? You know, the one your internship requires you turn in? - Yeah, it's, uh, it's imminent. - So is death. Be more specific. I-I'm just doing polish. It's basically done. Noah shapiro at the "paris review"is looking forward to it.

Eleanor returns next week, and we are still behind. Now since i have to go to that party this weekend, I won't be around, and therefore, neither will you, So you'd better get twice as much work done today, Or you will regret it. As for little j., looks like this summer</i> - <i>Has been all work and no play.</i> - You can't be finished. There's no way you could possibly be finished. Don't you do anything when you leave here, ginny?</i> Um, actually, i was hoping i could show you Something i've been working on. This isn't school. I don't look at your work. I was an intern once, too. It gets better. What is that? - Oh, it's a dress i make for the white party. - For the vitamin water party? Who invited you ? oh, lace? It's not even white. It's bone. It's way too big for you. Don't you know how to fit? - It's huge. - Well, it's not actually for me. It's for you. Um, i'm not going to the party, so...

If i'm gonna wear a custom anything, It's gonna matter. - Here's what you asked for laurel. - since you did so well With repairing the trim on the dead stock, Match these up. Oh, and put that away. Eggshell gives me a migraine. Well, i guess now's as good a time as any to order dinner. - What do you want? Indian? - Oh, it's too hot for indian. How about popsicles? Hey. Where's mom? Oh, she and alex had tickets to "south pacific." - What is that, more homework? - Finish your story yet? - Almost. - Good. I'm hoping by reading it That maybe i can figure out why you and serena broke up anyway. yeah, me, too. Hey, jen, i'm gonna head out and get some food. i'll be back in a bit. This is the first time I've seen you look in the mirror all summer. Here i thought if you did, you'd turn to stone. You must be pretty nervous about something If you're willing to take that risk. Ha ha, sis. I'm on my way out to lily pond. With the triplets returning to rio, I thought i'd continue my tour of south america. - I'm thinking argentina. - Then what are the flowers for? You wouldn't perhaps have overheard a recent phoho call With a certain best friend of mine Who mentioned she's on her way out here on the jitney? - What's a jitney? - If that's your way of saying no, that i'm glad to hear it, 'Cause blair will never forgive you for what you did to her. Who told you that little piece of advice-- - Your "boyfriend" nate? - Nate didn't say anything. Good, 'cause i don't think it's wise taking relationship advice From somebody in a fake relationship. Call me crazy. Enjoy another night alone with your thoughts. Good luck on your suicide mission.

Please don't tell me you jusus sat around watching "the closer" And eating takeout from nick and toni's. No,della femina. What about all those rumors i heard about you and nate? Mnh-Mnh-Mnh. Completely untrue. They just gogopeople off my back about being sad, And then nate could do whatever he wanted, So it worked out for both of us. You're telling me You didn't have any fun with anyone all summer? Oh,there was this hot liliguard that asked me out. But i,you know, i-I turned him d dn. What? Are you crazy? A hot lifeguard is like kleenex-- Use once and throw away. You couldn't ask for a better rebound. I don't think i'm ready. I-I still miss dan sometimes.... More than sometimes... all the time. The only thing lamerer than dating dan humphrey Is mourning dan humphrey.. You haven't gotten back out ere and had your summer fling. Yeah,the triplets esquerda'd, But not before teaching me some portuguese tongue twisters. I'll see ya. James is the classiest guy i've ever met,you know? (Laughs) He drinks gin martinisis and he speaks six languages, And he gave me this amazing bulgari pearl choker With a aold "b" clasp on it. Wait,i thought your dad gave yououhat. Who's james? Oh,my god,b. ( (Ughs) He sounds amaming. The last time we talked,um... you hadn't even n t him. Oh,i know! He swept me off mymyeet. 'S so charming. Plus,he tells the best stories. You're lying. I am not. Your eyes arardoing that thing Ere they don't match your mouth. I wasn't aware that robots got jealous. Did they update your software whilili was away? Come on. You and i both know this guy's'sust a prop You bought t ttry to hurt me like i hurt you. You didn't hurt me. Well,i will admit, Waiting for you in tuscany the first few w ys Were mildly humiliating. But when i realized you weren't gonna show,i i llied. Luckily,i made a friend on the trip over. Boring ben-- My dad's ex-Employee? By the way, i had him fired just for you. Well,i owe him m erything. He introduced me to james. You know,i think he might be the one. Prove it. I don't have to prove anything. But if you want to get to know james better, I'll bring him to dinner tonight. I'll bet you'll like him just as much as i do. Oh,and if by that you mean I won't like him at all, then you're right. I'll see you at 7:00. Now how w out we go find that lifeguard? But we have to stop at nate's first. He has something of mine that i need. (Jenny) hey. How's vermomo? Great. Vanessa and her parentswere at I didn't even know she was up here. When i asked her how dan was doing,she didn't answer. I had hoped maybe that she could help himm Get over serena this summer. I don't think dan needs any help in that department, And i think vanessa noticed. Is he still dating up a storm? Well,if you call a different girl everyryight "dating." I'm a little worried about him,dad. Is he there? He's still sleeping. He was out pretty late last night. Have him call me en he wakes up. Hey,you know,you haven't told me how the dress went over. Ah,it's over. Uh,laureleloesn't want to wear it to the party. Well,why don't you wear it? Dad,as nice as it is that you're encouraging g To get my designs out there, the white party's,like,e, Last year,they even turned away jack johnson. Sounds like a party with taste. Dad! Also sounds like the kind of party The van der woodsens would go to. Have you asked eric about it? Yeah,that might be a little awkward, Considering the last c cversation we had. I sort of said some things i shouldn'n'have. You know,maybe i should have just come with you this susuer. Eleanor's been in paris, like,the entire time, And laurel's been so worried about everything. What if it was a waste? It's not a waste if there's time to change itit Mamae you should start with eric and then go from there. Thanks,dad. See you sunday? You u ow it. Okayaybye. (Man) not today,kid. It's all right,joe. He's with me. I'm sorry to interrupt you while you're wororng. You wouldn't be interrupting if you'd shown up on t te.

You told me you were serious ababt writing. I-I know. I tried to write. I did. But every timeme sat down, It's just,there was something in the way. I couldndn focus. Excuses ararfor the unemployed, of which you are now one. If you won't do your homework,k, then neither will i. You'll get no letter of recomomndation from me. W-Working for you is very important to me. And yet,your actions s ve illustrated only the opposite. Drop my spare key in the mail. That i'm sure you have time to do. If it's apology time, you're about three months late. Eric,wait-- And let me guess. You want somethihi. Yeah,you're right. Um,does it help that the new me st answered that honestly? Not really. Look... (sighs) i know i acted Like a complete and total raging bitch last year. But what you don't know is how bad i feltltbout it all summer. You were the only person that was friendndwith me for me, Well,you did get yours in the end. And since it's not like i have many friends myself, Manipulating,backstabbing one i can n t.

Uh,roman?Only briefly at the ch althoughghat didn't seem to like me nearly as much. I have the scars to prove it. Well,you certainly have crammed an awful lot Into such a short time togethehe I wondnd, has blair had a chance To share her favorite movies with you yet? "Tiffany's," "roman holiday," and of course,"charade." Oh,i thought yoyo third favorite was "funny face." It is. I hate "chahade." Chuck,stop harassing him. Yeah,uh,"how well do you know blair waldorf?" Is kinda boring for those of us who actually know blair waldorf. Not to mention transparent. Well,thank you,g gndma. Why is it when y y say that word it sounds like an insult? No,no,i-I don't mind.. I would like to learn as much as i can about blairir And there's no better way to l lrn than through a quiz. Well,it's a shame you guys took a bus and not a limo. I don't know i iyou know this, but blair loves a limo-- Sweetie,will you please pass me the salt andndepper? Uh,excuse me. I think i just lostmy appetite. Will you excuse me? Chuck. Look,i know what that pin means to you. You gave it to nate the first time you said you loved him. Well,i asked for it back. I thought james should have it now. Do you,uh... ?? I do. I'll see you at school. Oh,my goodness. My pin must have gotten caught on your sweater by mistake. Oh,wow. I didn't feel anything. Well,nathaniel, you have a choice-- Under the bed or out the window. What? My h hband just pulled up. Your husband? I thought he wasn't supposed to be home t tl next week. Seems he's home early. (Man) whoa. (Serena) nate? What the hell's hihideal? I have no idea. Damn that mother-Chucker. Ugh! He--He's totallllright. I don't even like james. ?? Only hooked up with him a week ago Because i knew that t couldn't get off the plane alone. D it would kill me if chuck knew that he'd ruined my summer. Oh,b.,i'm so sorry. Was it really bad? I would be in my cabana at the hôTel du capap And ththe he would be. Amid all the fireworks on bastille day, All i could see was that chuck bass-Tard. The limo's taking me back in n  hour. You're welcome to join m m dude,you're not going to the white party? Come on. Pretty girls, white dresses. Unless there's a sprinkler, i don't care. Besides,it's tourist season in the city. Easy pickings. Ah. Okay, and i don't want blair Throwing her callboy in my face. At least i could have e tten A more interesting stand-In than james. Do you know how hard it is To find a good fake boyfriend on short notice? Well,he was smart and fun at tea yesterday, D he's really cute,too. You don't have to lie anymore, serena. He served his purpose. Now that chuck is on h h way back to the city, I can n mp james just in time to go to the white party stag. How was your date, by the way? After a few w urs with that guy, I needed lifif saving, not guarding. Babysteps,machéRi.

I can't talk about that here. So where's princeton? I'm surprised you let him get away. James goes to georgetown, and unlike you,i don't lose something if i letett out of my sight. When you told me your secret girlfriend was older, I thought you meant college.Not to mention, catherine's married. I don't know where you've been, But your boy toy is a princeton man. He and i talked about it while you played dress up with serena last night. Therine ended it with me last night. (Serena) what? Tell me. You misheard,chuck.

Yeah,well,that's not what he told blair. Do some research,junior. I'm in the mood to be right. I can't believe that i get a job working fofomy literary idol, And he--And he cans me, you know? I did everything he asked from picking up his dry cleaning To keeping him sober before noon,which was, Believe me,the hardest thing i've ever done. Hahaer than finishing that story? I i st couldn't write it,dad. I-I-I don't know why. You're talking to a guy who couldn't finish a new songng In 12 years. I get it. So what is the storyrybout anyway?

Well,if i can offer some fatherly advice From 300 miles away... i-I i ven't finished the story because i haven't Dealt with my feelings over the way i ended it with sesena. Couldn't have said it better myself,even if you'd let me. I've tried not to think about her all l mmer. I was afraid if i did, that i w wld-- I would see that i made a huge mistste. So i've just been trying to distract myself the best i canan Wellllyou've been running all summer. Maybe it's time you stopped, And you turned around and faced it. So not only did james schiller not go to princeton, He also didn't go to georgetown. In fact,i couldn't find a record of him Any of the big schools. Since when did you become sherlock holmes?

More than it already was By being my grandfather's suit from the '70s. I miss that little laugh of yours. Shh,just... Okay. When words get in the way, There's really only one thingleft to do.

They say summer love is fleeting, But sometimes, what starts as a fling Can lead to the real thing. * i fell in love without you * A simple trip totohe beach could be all it takes</i> To clear our heads and open our hearts Andwrite a new ending to an old storor * every aching wound will cauterize andndruise * * in memory of what we used to call "in love" * There are those who got burned by the heat.</i> They just want to forget and start over...</i> * and only titi will tell * * if violins s ll swell * * in memory of what we u ud to call "in love" * While there are others who want ch moment to last forever.</i> But everyone can agree on one thing--</i> Tans fade,highlights s  dark, And we all get sick of sand in our shoes.</i> But the end of summer is the beginning of a new season,</i> So we e nd ourselves looking to the future.</i> * every aching wowod * * will cauterizizand bruise * You ain't seen nothing yet.
