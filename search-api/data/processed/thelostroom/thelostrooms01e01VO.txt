It's real. Money first. He says money first. Nice doing business with you. What did I miss? Iggy. Who the hell are you? Weasel, don't. I-- My friend marco here made a silly mistake, and sold you something that belongs to me. Now, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take it back. Get out. Easy. Why does he keep clicking that pen, man? Shoot him! Robbery? Doesn't look like the register's been touched. Smells like somebody had a barbecue. Somebody did. What the hell happened to you, friend? I thought we had two bodies. We do. Ruby. Hello, peaches. Nice homicides. - Only the best for you, Ruby. - Who's our friend, the owner? Uh, manager. Jake Scuillo. Owner's a guy named Karl Kreutzfeld. Not present. Ruber, you got a cause of death? Funny you should ask me that, because no. - How 'bout burnt to a crisp? - How 'bout not? Look it. The clothes. They should have lit up first. What, they torched him, then they dressed him? Electrocuted, maybe. What about our superhero? Marco Cordova. Customer, apparently. Neck's broken, like he was shot out of a cannon. This doesn't make any sense. You guys might want to call the cops. I mean, thrown against the wall, okay. But this- We've got a possible witness. Ignacio llosa. - Punched in. Never punched out. - Oh, jeez. - You know him, Joe? - Yeah, he's a sweet kid, but he's got a nightmare family. Let's pick him up. Mr. Montague, I gotta go to work in the morning. I'd kinda like to get some sleep tonight at some- Maybe you should have thought about that before you lost the key. We gotta find that kid. Make a left. Kathy and me are going up to the lake this weekend. You and Anna can come, if you want. You don't have to invite us every time you go up there, Lou. Are you kidding? Kathy loves that kid. What did your lawyer say? Vanessa might have a case. You're her father. You stuck around. You're not gonna lose that kid. Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop stop. That's Iggy. Iggy! Stop! Iggy! Iggy, open up. Hang on. Where is he? He's gone. I want that cop's name. Can I be done? - Okeydoke. - Thank you. Hey, hey, hey. Dishes, missy. How was school today? Billy Frazier brought in a huge earthworm. - Yeah? - I touched it. - Disgusting. - Yeah. Come here. Let me see your hand. - Ew, I can still feel the slime! - No, you can't! I can. Oh-- Miller. We just picked up Iggy. At his mom's. You better get in here, Joe.</i> I'll be right there. - Hi, Lee. - Hi, Anna baby. You got Iggy? You need the interview room? No, my office. You mind? You swore to me I'd never see you in here. You swore. Look at me when i'm talking to you! Two men got burnt to death. Tell me what happened. - I can't. - You can't? Your old man would have killed you if your mom hadn't killed him first. I convinced the D.A. it was self-defense. I lied for you. If I tell you, my mom's dead. I'll protect her. I promise. But, detective Joe, who's gonna protect you? Nice watch. - Can I use the bathroom? - No. - I feel like i'm gonna puke. - I'll bet you do. What's this? You have an apartment. What's with the motel key? You don't know what motel you're staying in?! It's not a real place. What? - I'm gonna puke. I'm gonna go to the... - Sit down! Sit down! You're not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. Now, what is going on? Just tell me what happened. How'd he burn'em? Three dudes came in. I never seen them before. The main guy, they called him the weasel. How did he burn 'em? How did he burn 'em, Iggy? Tell me. Iggy! I got the phone records. Our fried guy called his boss just before he got killed. His boss? The guy who owns the pawn shop Karl Kreutzfeld. That's so awesome. Happy birthday, Isaac. Time for cake an icecream, come on! Mr. Kreutzfeld, did you make all this money in a pawn shop? Oh God, no. No, I own a chain of dry cleaners. I admit, it's ridiculous how much people pay to have their clothes washed without water. The... pawn shop is my grandfather's. Was. Now it's mine. It was his life, actually. He... loved things. Show me your things, and I can tell you your life story. Something like that. Please understand, I've never had an employee killed on the job before. This is very disturbing, to say the least. Jake Scuillo called you just before the time of the murders. Yeah, he wanted to know about closing up early. Business was slow, which is not unusual. What about your other employee, Ignacio Llosa? Make a wish, Isaac. Did he mention anything about a key? A key? No, he didn't say anything about a key. I'm sorry I'm so distracted today. If there's anything else I can do, to help, please call me. I sincerely hope you catch this son of a bitch. Thank you. I don't care about the money. I just want to get rid of it. I'm in a parking lot. Hello? Jennifer? I've got it here. Where are you? Hello, Jennifer? - So, what do you want to watch tonight? - Nemo. Again? Come on. How about Abbot & Costello? Nemo. Abbot & Costello meet Frankenstein? Come on, it's got Frankenstein. Stay there. Anna, go to your room, now! Iggy? I'm sorry, detective Joe. Hang in there, all right? This is detective Joe Miller. I need an ambulance. I've got a kid bleeding to death. I'm sorry. There's no one else. They double-crossed me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... it's you. It opens... every door. It opens every... door. What are you talking about? It opens... every... door. - Hey, guys. - Hey. You want to sleep at our place tonight? No. We're all right. We're good. Hey, listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. Hey, sweetie. No, they're gonna stay here tonight. My God. Hi. Take me home. Dad? What's in there? It's just a dream, sweetheart. You see? Back to bed. 1968, burn victim. Unsolved. He swallowed a motel key? Pawn shop victim. The entry wounds are the same. - I'm sorry. - It's me. Are you coming to bed, Martin? Yeah, actually, sweetie. Can you make animal pancakes? Can I make animal pancakes? What kind of animal pancakes you want? Elephant. I don't know how to make an elephant, but how 'bout a mouse? Elephant. All right, one elephant pancake coming up. Yeah. Hey, Lou. She's a little spooked, but she seems like she's doing all right. We have another court date tomorrow. But right now I'm making elephant pancakes. Everything's pretty normal. Hey, Anna, check this out. Stuff keeps disappearing in the room. What room? The magic room. Okay. Pick one. You know, I don't think we should be doing this. Just pick... pick a stuffed animal. All right. Not Lester Bony fish. Okay. Okay, this one. This one? - You sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Now watch. Hey, Anna, Anna, get back here. Anna, what are you doing? Come on, get out of there. Okay. Experiment over, okay? That's it. Open it. Come on, that's it, okay? Game over. Okay? Oh, Dad. Listen. Listen to me. I need you to make me a promise. All right? Not to tell anyone about the room, or the key... - Or anything else, all right? - Okay. Promise me. I promise. - Duuh! Jeez, Joe! - Good morning. You scared the hell out of me. How'd you, uh-- I know how Ignacio did it. Get dressed. What if it resets while we're in there? I think as long as we have the key, we're safe. We got water and electricity. We can go anywhere? Anywhere with a door, I think. Penn state's playing. According to the money transfert, someone tried to buy this key for two million bucks. I'd pay three. Well, we can't keep it. Three people are dead because of it. I know. But let's enjoy it now. While we can. Okay? Who knows if we're gonna get another chance like this. Yeah. Hey, Bridgewater. Direct from Cuba, but you didn't get it from me. Keep it. I don't smoke those stinky things. Me neither. I just like giving them away. You got a visitor. Jennifer Llosa. Iggy's sister. I'm sorry about your brother. Half brother. Thanks. Were you and Ignacio close? I left home... early. I always thought we'd be closer when he got older, but... I guess not. My mother asked me to come down for any outstanding paperwork. I'm pretty sure it's all taken care of. Unless you want to sign for his personal effects. So, Jennifer Llosa. Something wrong? Iggy didn't have a sister. You took it, didn't you? Tell me what it is. I'm responsible for that key. - Give it to me. - Who are you? - Let me go. - Not until you tell me. Let me show you. Hey, Joe! Joe! You okay? What's wrong? She knows. Who? Miller has the key. Do I have to get a shot? No, I told you, it's not that kind of a doctor. They just want to ask you some questions about what it's like to live here and stuff. Do I have to go? Yeah. You do. These people just want to help us, and make sure that we're doing good. And we are, right? Yeah, except for you not letting me stay up late. Well, you make sure and tell Dr. Gellman that. Okay. All right. Anna Miller? You ready? Yeah. Paging Dr. Steadman, Dr. Steadman, please.</i> Okay. Have fun. Tell the truth. Okay, I will. Do you know how long this is gonna be? We have a - court thing at 17h. - It'll be a couple of hours. If you'd like, there's a coffee shop across the street - from the hospital. - Thank you. I'm through eating this mush. I'm getting some real food. - Mr. Jabrowski,get back in bed. - Get your hands off me! For your crimes against decency, and politeness, and common courtesy, I condemn you to Hell! Hey! Hey. Hey. Where am I, man? I don't know. Oh, man. Hospital. Wait, don't... do that. Why won't you stay gone?! So you're the new motel guy? - Tell me about the bus ticket. - Why? You want it back or not? - What's your name? - Wally. Wally, I'm detective Joe Miller. Cop? Interesting angle. What were you in the hospital for? Hemorrhoids. Laser surgery. What's it to you, detective? My daughter's here for a psyche evaluation, her mother's suing for custody after three years, and she'll probably win, thanks for asking. Oh, sorry. I mean, sorry. You forget to be human sometimes. Can I get you anything else? Thank you. It's on me. Can I have a greek omelet? Actually, two. I blew the last of my money on the surgery. Put it... Put it away! - What is it? - Is this a joke? No. I don't know what it is. Nice talking to you. Okay, okay. It's an object. Yeah? One of many. Okay, where do they come from? From the motel room. All the objects come from the motel room, you've been there, you used the key, right? You really don't know what I'm talking about? Holy crap. It's amateur hour. This guy's got the key, doesn't even know what it is. How many objects are there? All right. All right. All right. There's a lot of 'em. About a hundred, at least. Nobody really knows for sure. A hundred? - And do they all... - They do... weird stuff. Some are useful, some aren't. Used to know a guy who had the pencil. You know what the pencil does? Makes pennies. Tap it on the table, penny falls out. That's it. Guy made 500 bucks a day tapping the damn pencil noon to night. Six months of that, tapped his brains out. Then there's the umbrella. Makes people think they know you. Particularly helpful if you're shy. Last guy who had it moved to Seattle, to be less conspicuous. But other objects... say the... key, for example, highly useful. What about the bus ticket? Not that useful. Unless you want to get to a little spot outside Gallup, New Mexico, in a jiffy, which I don't. Why Gallup? Why not? What happened in that motel room? Wally. Something terrible. Look... detective Miller, do you ever feel that there's something wrong with the universe? Yeah, sure. Well, you're right. Things like this shouldn't happen. But in that motel room, they did. Nobody really knows what happened, but everybody's got a theory. Some people think that God died, and that all these objects, they're little pieces of his corpse. Some people say that's crap. They think that some part of the universe broke down, and it's just physics gone haywire. And other people think that God is alive, and this is some kind of test. And they're all out trying to collect all the objects like pilgrims looking for relics during the middle ages. And what do you think, Wally? Who gives two squirts? All that matters is the price. That's what nobody gets. There's always a price to pay for using the objects. Whether you know it or not, there's always a price. What price did you pay? I'm not the one you should be worried about. See, objects attract one another like magnets. You think we ran into each other by accident? Every time you use that key, it's like alarms going off. People are coming for you, Joe. Bad people. They're crawling out of the woodwork. They don't even know who you are, but they're already looking for you. Probably emptying your underwear drawer right now, looking for that thing. And I think you understand me when I say that they won't mind killing you... or killing your family to get their hands on it. Anna. Hi. Anna Miller? Anna Miller, is she still with the doctor? Where's the other receptionist? Anna miller. I'm sorry, sir, she already left. Left? What do you mean she left?! With her father? Miller. I think you have something of mine, detective Miller.</i> Who is this? I know I have something of yours. Care to trade? Come on, come on, pick up. Lou, it's me. They got Anna. She's in a rail station off of route. Call me. Lose the doors. Burn 'em. Daddy! Hey, Joe. Were my directions okay? - What does the gun do? - It shoots bullets really fast. It's gonna be okay. Do you know what the pen can do... detective Miller? It can cook your daughter like a microwave. Here... let me show you. Stop. Smart man, your father. I'll give you the key. You'll give me my daughter back, and then you'll leave, understand? Of course. Grab him! You killed my brother! Gimme that key! Anna! Anna! Daddy! Noooo! Reset it! I didn't mean to! You can bring her back, she's not dead! There's an object that can bring her back. I can take you to it. God, Anna. You know what this looks like? He's in the middle of a custody battle. His ex said he missed their court appointment, and now, he and Anna are gone. Joe wouldn't run. Then where did that little girl go? We've got blood, ladies and gentlemen Come on, Joe. Answer. - Destefano. - Yeah, it's me. Holy God, you're okay. Anna with you? No, she's gone. Where is she? She went into the room. She went into the room, and she's gone. Joe... you need to come home. We'll figure this thing out. They're already thinking the worst. They found blood on the door. What about the body? There was a burned body. We didn't find a body. They just want to know what happened to Anna. Well, she's alive, Lou. Listen, I need you to do a background check for me on a guy that Iggy called the weasel. Joe. I gotta go. Hello. Where'd you come from? What? Where were you two minutes ago? Texas. Let this be a lesson to you all, cowboy, that no man shall judge, tease, or criticize another man. You can't be mean. You shouldn't be mean. Being me-- - Hi, Wally. - Oh, hi. I suppose it's possible. There's a chance. A very small chance you can bring the kid back out of this room. Well, tell me how I can do it. Well... Sometimes... When you start getting objects together, weird things happen. New things. New properties. Totally unpredictable. Take the watch. Useless, right? - The watch? - Wristwatch. Cooks eggs. Nothing else, just eggs. Put an egg in the middle, hard-boils it. I don't know how somebody figured that out, but they did. Anyway, nobody used to care much about the watch until one day somebody found out that if you put the watch and the knife together, you get a... kind of telepathy. So you're saying that if I find the right object, - and I use it with the key... - I don't know, Joe... it's a million to one. - I'll take it. - Whatever you do, don't lose the key. If you lose it, you'll never get her back. Cop's kid vanished. Him too. It's not right. We need to find the key before the weasel. Before. Lou. I got a sample of Anna's blood from the hospital, and I ran it against what we found in the storage room. It's a match. You think you could lose that report for a little while? Lou... - 24 hours, tops. - Thanks, Marty. Ignacio's personal effects? Yeah. What? Dr. Ruber, I compiled all the death certificates for the burn victims, like you asked.</i> Yeah. - But I ran into trouble on one of them. - What's the problem?</i> The burn case from 93. He's still alive.</i> His name is Milton Vrang. - Is this a trick? - No. Not at all. Whenever I talk about it, they up my meds. You're safe. You can tell me anything. I'll tell you what I used to believe. Not what I believe now, because now... I'm healthy. What I used to believe is... is that there were these things spread throughout the world that looked like ordinary things, but weren't. But if you could find all these things, they would lead a path... and you could know the mind of God. I used to believe I belonged to a cabal, a group that was dedicated to collecting all the objects for this holy purpose. But some of the objects... are full of holy... holy fire. So, you see, when I was... when I was touched with the pen... I burned. Burned! A pen? A ballpoint pen? - Did they send you to kill me? - Who? - The order. - No. Mr. Vrang, I need you to tell me everything you know. Please. Please. Tell me about the key. What the hell. Took you long enough, detective. Make sure you get all of 'em. One of these radios is an object. I'm trying to figure out which one. By smashing it? You can't break an object. Haven't you learned anything yet? Guess that's the one. Supposed to make you three inches taller, if you tune it to the right station. Fascinating. So, who are you? Jennifer Bloom. One of the dead men in the pawn shop, Marco Cordova, I knew him. He was my second. My partner. Former partner. Went rogue about six months ago. He took the key. Joe, if I wanted, I could have killed you the moment you walked in here. But I didn't. That's not what we're about. Rule number one, we don't kill. Ever. And who's "we"? We're called the legion. We're trying to get rid of the objects. For good. All of them. We track the owners, make contact, ask them to give us their objects, join our cause. That ever work? I've had people beg me. Tell me, since you found the key, has your life gotten better, or worse? My daughter went into the room. And I need the key to bring her back. The legion can help you. Let us. How are you gonna help me? Join, and I'll tell you everything. Right. Joe, wait. Leave it. I think I'll skip nap time today. We need you, Joe. And you need us. I'm a friend of Milton Vrang's, and I'm calling about the order of the reunification. I didn't order anything. The number you have dialed has been disconnect...</i> - Hello? - Hello. I'm a friend of Milton vrang's. I'm calling about the order of the reunification. The order? Yes. The new religion. Is that him? Yeah, that's him. I shouldn't even be here. It'll just make you a target. Enough with that. We're in this thing together all the way. All right? Whatever the hell this thing is. Partners. What's his name? Howard Montague. The weasel. Howard Montague. We'll open an investigation, make it official. Come on, what would we even say? We don't say anything, we just show 'em the key. I can't risk losing it. The key's my only shot at bringing Anna back. Well, at least make a statement, and clear your name. We'll look for Anna together. Let me help you. Yeah, sure, Lou. All right. Now, we gotta talk to Lee. She's smart. She won't flip out. At least I don't think she will. Do you? Now, you know killing me won't bring your little Anna back. Then you better tell me what will. May I remind you you're an officer of the law? Say that again. Say that again! If you lie to me, you're dead. Understand? Is there an object that can bring her back? In concert with the key, - yes. - What is it? - Tell me! - Not unless you let me go. No deals. Listen, you ever want to see your kid again, you will deal with me. I get you the object, you give me the key. That's the deal. When I get my daughter back, I'll give you the key. When she's safe. Deal. Give me the pen. It's mine. I don't want you sticking it in my ribs the next time I turn around. Now, reach into your pocket. Drop it. What else you got? Underpants too, Montague. This is idiotic. My underwear is not an object. Well, then, I'm sure you wont' miss 'em. I hope you're proud of yourself. Are any of those things the object I'm looking for? No. Don't be stupid. Good. That's-- that's my-- The pen. It's still there. And it moved. The object survived the reset. Maybe that's where it's supposed to go. You really read this stuff? I used to teach it before I was unjustly terminated. Come here, look. My masterpiece. It's a map of all of the objects. Their relationship to one another. You see... over here's the key. Pivotal object, very powerful. What's this? The prime object. The one that connects everything. They say that the prime object controls all of the other objects. And it will bring my daughter back. If you use it with the key. Yes. What is it? The clock. You're sure Kreutzfeld has the clock? Oh, yeah. He's an object collector. He uses the pawn shops to comb for objects. Keeps everything up on the third floor, but security is tight. Why does he need so much protection? Maybe he's afraid someone's gonna try to steal the clock. Corner of Smithfield and Liberty 4:30 PM. Thursday. Thank you. Just keep the change. Did you see that blue car go by?</i> Was it pretty? Stop making phone calls if you want to live. - I have questions. - Bring us an object. You'll get answers. Kreutzfeld converted this place to be the most anti-key house you could ever think of. See, he pulled a permit in '96. The front door is a sliding door, no pintumbler lock. - The key won't work. - Every door in this house slides. Even the closets. Can't get inside with the key. This area here, it's bulletproof glass, three layers thick. You see these doors? They all have electronic locks. You need a pass card to get through 'em. - So, once the alarm system is triggered... - You're sealed in. Sitting ducks. You realize now why I've never attempted this. Let's check the original plans against these revised plans. Where did this door go? There were two doors going into this room, and now there's only one. There's a wall. He got rid of it, I guess. Made it more secure that way. I know how we're getting in. There are lots of guards. You're gonna have to shoot 'em all. How many bullets do you have? If I shoot anybody, it's gonna be you. That's not very collaborative. What's the most powerful object you can think of? The key. No, I mean dangerous, like a weapon. The eye. The glass eye. Nobody's seen it in years. You'll never find it. What does the eye do? Well, to tell you the truth... - Shut up. - All right. Get a message to your boss. Tell Kreutzfeld I have a present for him. The weasel. I want to make a trade. Meet me out front, and don't try anything funny. I have the eye. You son of a... Will you shut up? I'm not gonna give you over to Kreutzfeld. I'm just trying to clear the house. How are we supposed to get in there now? With the key. There are no viable doors in that house. There's one. Close the door. It's our only way out. We're never gonna make it back downstairs. Now close it. I want the entire building secured.</i> Protect the upstairs. Back to bed, kiddo. Okay? Easy. Hands out to your sides. Get his access card. What's the code? What's the code? Stay. Anthony, have you secured upstairs? Anthony? They're upstairs. Dormant objects. Their properties haven't been discovered yet. Where's the clock? Well, you didn't think he'd leave it out in the open, did you? Hand me the ax. But... you gotta be kidding. You can't expect to open a safe with an ax. The door... It's still here? - Sometimes they build over 'em. - Sometimes? - Open it. - I can't! Break it down. - It's bulletproof. - Break it down! Look out, look out! Hurry up. Joe... we got a problem. There's no knob, there's no lock. We can't use the key. come on! - What the hell are you doing? - Check the bag. A door knob? This is your plan, huh? You're remodeling. Plug it in. Couldn't get cordless, huh? - Shut up and plug it in. - All right. Kill the power in the study. Gimme that light over here. Is that knob gonna work? I mean, does that count? Now the next one! Hurry it up. Come on! - Light. I need light. - Right! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on. Oh, my God. Not without the clock. Come on! - Hurry up! - Don't stop! Come on! Detective Miller, there are events in motion that are far greater than you could understand. I will help you. I will get you anything you want, but I must have that key. Now get in there! Get 'em! Look out. I used to know a safecracker. It's possible I could look him... There it is. There it is. Now what do I do? To bring my daughter back, what do I do? Open it? You better know what the hell you're talking about. Please, bring my daughter back. Please, bring my daughter back. This can't be. It's impossible. It's a prime object! It's the clock! It has to be. I'm right. I'm always right. Look, we had a deal. - I get you that clock, you give me the key. - When my daughter is safe. It doesn't work in the room. Hello. We'll bring you in, we'll show 'em the key. We'll blow the whole thing wide open. There won't be a case against you after this. And then we'll get Anna back. Whatever it takes, I promise. Destefano. Hi, Lou, it's Martin. Ruby! What sweet wind blows in my direction? I need to see you and Joe Miller. It's important. It's about the key. This isn't just a random collection of things. There is something going on. Some people think that these things are... a way to communicate with God. Some say the objects are God. Come on. I'm not saying I believe that. I don't know what I believe. It's just... Can I see the key? Please? I just have to know if it's real. I've been waiting all my life... for something, it's this. We can't tell anyone. Rube, we gotta clear Joe. They'll put him away for kidnapping. Or worse, murder. We have to show them the key. I've gotta save my daughter, Ruber. And Lou's right, I can't do it alone. - I don't have any other choice. - Your daughter is gone, and I'm so sorry for you. But you can't bring her back. We have to keep the key to ourselves. We have to use this. I've made my decision. Marty! Give me the key, Joe. Rube, come on. This is crazy. Whose side are you on? My side. Lou! Lou! Lou! Lou. Don't make me shoot you too. Give me the key, Joe. Okay. Just take it easy. You want the key, Ruber? Oh, my god. Helen, wait! Helen? It's okay. Yes, I need to report a murder. Detective Joe Miller just... shot Lou Destefano, his partner.
