to a room unlike any other.</i> What if it resets while we're in there? As long as we have the key, we're safe. A room that can take you around the world</i> - We can go anywhere? - Anywhere with a door I think. and gives power to everything inside. It's an object. One of many. - How many are there? - About a hundred at least. You can't break an object. - And do they all... - They do weird stuff. Some people think that these things are... a way to communicate with God. Since you've found the key, has your life gotten better or worse? People are coming for you, Joe. They won't mind killing you, or your family to get their hands on these objects. - Anna!! - Daddy! My daughter disappeared inside that room. Is there an object that can bring her back? Yes, the prime object. Give me the key, Joe. Whose side are you on? Detective Joe Miller just shot his partner. Hello? Daddy! Daddy, help me, please! Bingo. Glad to see me? I'm not sure I can trust you. Sorry. Look, you called me. You need the Legion's help. I'm helping you. How do I know you're going to help me? Well, I'm not the one who killed my partner. I didn't kill Lou. Look at me. I didn't. Okay. Here, some fake ID's, a couple of credit cards, this should last for a while. "Joe Doorman?" Hilarious. I have two objects here. It's your nail file and the pen. Get rid of them. Do whatever you guys do. Does this mean you're gonna join us? Just tell me what you know about the prime object. Most people think it's a myth. Those who don't? End up dead or crazy looking for it. Why? I need it to find my daughter. You're gonna get yourself killed. Joe! Next. And my photos. What's the last name? Stritzke. S.T.R.I.T.Z.K.E. Oh, Mr. Stritzke's here. Did you ever here of digital? 12 bucks. Hey! What's going on? Next time, have a little couth, huh? Great. Damn it! - He must've ditched the key. - We'll go back, check the alley again. Indestructible. No joke. Marty. - Detective Lee. - Hi. Look, I'm sorry to make you go through this again, but I'm still a little confused about the order of events around Lou's murder. I've already spoken to internal affairs. I know. Bear with me. I just have some questions of my own. Who fired the first shot? You're not on this case officially, are you? No, no, I just want to understand. I'm sorry, Lee. It's been a terrible week. Helen hasn't been sleeping, and quite frankly neither have I. If you've read the report, it should all add up. The crime scene matches my description. Forensically...yes. I'm really tired. - You have to eat, hon. - I can't. It's this house. I can't stay in this house anymore, Marty. Lou was murdered in the next room. - Helen, please. - You saw joe pull the trigger. He almost killed you. Helen, you have no idea what you're talking about! I'm sorry, hon. It's just... What? What? Don't get the phone. Don't get the phone! What do you mean I have no idea? Martin! I have to take it. Hello. Have you found us an object, dr. Ruber? Uh, I'm trying. I... You had a chance to take the key. Did you take it? It got away from me. Bring us an object and you'll be welcomed into the Order with open arms. Do you understand? Perfectly. Look for Kang. K-A-N-G. Kang. Martin, who was that? Martin! Detective Miller. I should thank you for exposing my... security weaknesses. I won't. Bit of a sore loser. Come on in. Where's the key? You can't have it. But it's mine. I paid for it. I gave someone money. It's mine. It was stolen from me. That's a crime, detective. Or are you so far gone you no longer care about the law? I guess not. You broke into my house. Stole my clock. You mind if I sit down? Please. My daughter went inside that room. The motel room. And she's gone. So I need the key to get her back. How on Earth would you do that? The prime object. Whatever it is, I'm gonna find it. How about I... give you some advice instead? Walk away. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. You certainly don't know just how deep this well goes. And that you will never climb out. Unless you just walk away. You done? You've done me wrong, detective Miller. It's just that simple. Men and women have died doing me wrong. You're not getting the key. You can lose all you ever wanted. I have nothing to lose. Take the coat. Let him go. We have a lot in common, detective. I could have helped you, Sorry about your daughter. I really am. Follow him? No. It's up to him now. Thanks buddy. Mr. Kreutzfeld? He's back. And bearing gifts. The clock returns. Thank you. Maybe I can trust you after all. The key stays with me for now. Why don't you tell me what you know about the prime object? Can we start over? As long as it don't begin with you shooting me in the back, yeah. Fair enough. - First name's Joe. Can I call you that? - That's my name. Mine's Karl. Joe, how much do you know about the objects, their history? Not a lot. First known date of existence is May 4th, 1961, no one really knows how or why they came to be. What we do know is that people have been fighting over them ever since. In the beginning, there was one cabal. The collectors. Started gathering objects before anyone else knew what was going on. Within five years, they had gathered almost all of them. Damn near 100. What happened then? Well, they annihilated themselves, didn't they? Most of them were killed. The rest simply went insane. But a few of the surviving disciples thought it best to gather the most important objects and hide them in a vault. I've spent a considerable amount of time and a ridiculous sum of money trying to find this vault. I have no idea where it is, but what I do know is that in order to get to it... - You need the key. - Yes. No offense, Karl. I just want to find my daughter. Yes, of course. The prime object is what you need. If it exists, it's inside the vault. I have my own object I need from the vault. The glass eye. They say it can repair all flesh. And what do you want it for? This handsome young man is my son Isaac. Hey, buddy. Fell asleep watching the movie? Yeah. Say hello to Joe. Hi, Joe. Hello, Isaac. I was telling him about our plans to cure you. - What's the name of your disease? - Leukemia. That's the one, huh? Go back to sleep, tough guy. Perhaps now you see why I'm so... desperate and willing to do whatever it takes. I too just want to save my child. Maybe we can help each other. The last possible surviving member of the collectors is a woman named Barbara Stritzke. She's nearly impossible to find or to kill because she has an almost unbeatable object, the comb. Oh, no! Oh, shoot! Oh, I'm so sorry. Did I scratch it? Oh, who can tell? I might have scratched it. Let me see if I can give you something for the scratch. Need your help. Where are you? I'll be back. Jennifer Bloom. What do you want, Joe? Well, I'm looking for somebody, and I thought you could help me. But... am I interrupting something? No, forget it. What are you looking for? I'm trying to find a woman named Barbara Stritzke. So now you need my help? You and Kreutzfeld. What a pair. He's all right for a rich guy. Under different circumstances, we could be friends. Kreutzfeld used to be on our side. He was Legion. Quit a few years ago. Started buying up objects like crazy. He paid my partner 2 million dollars to betray the Legion and steal the key. You really think you can trust a man like that? His kid is dying. My daughter vanished inside that room. I'm hoping we can help each other. Oh, don't be a sucker, Joe. Hey, I will try every means necessary to get my daughter back, every means. All right. I will help you find Barbara Stritzke. But afterwards, the Legion gets the comb. All right, deal. What does the comb do? It stops time. Wait here. - Arjun Mehta. How may I help you? - Look out your window. I've got Joe Miller in the car and he has the key. You brought him here? He doesn't know. I can take the key now with your say so. He's more valuable if we recruit him to our side. He won't join. He thinks he can bring back his daughter with the right objects. We all think we can undo things in the beginning. Remember? Well, if we don't act now, it could fall into Kreutzfeld's hands. Stay close to him. Earn his trust. Show him we're trying to help. And, Jennifer... Give him the Stritzke info. But stay with him. Well, I've got good news and bad news. The good news is I have a lead on Barbara Stritzke. She's in Michigan. And what's the bad news? It's Order territory. Badly cabal to mess with... Suzie Kang. Cash only. Paid upfront 30124 Eastwick. I'm sorry, hon. Excuse me. Excuse me. Are you Suzie Kang? - Do I know you? - No. My name's Martin Ruber. I'm looking for an object. Get lost. I have cash. What are you looking for? Something... easy. You know, something close. 5000. 5000 dollars. Your lucky day. Guy in Bloomfield's a mechanic. So he posts a query on some motorhead board asking if anyone knows why a pair of glasses would prevent a car from starting. - I don't get it. - The glasses inhibit combustion. Do you have an object? No, I just track 'em. Never touch 'em. Those things'll kill you. Thanks. Newbies. You gotta love 'em. Barbara always leaves a key up there in the frog. - When will she be back? - From the dead? - Well, how about never? - Here. I'll make it... Barbara's nephew Harold is living here now. He's let this place go to hell in a hand basket. - I hardly ever see him. - Well, we'll be just a minute. Okay. Well, I'll be right here when you come out. Okay! Guess Barbara was a good shot. No wonder the Order never messed with her. And it looks like nephew Harold's a Peeping Tom. Oh, my God. I'm gonna go check the women's locker room. Harold! Harold Stritzke! Oh my God! Come on! What are you doing? Harold, I need your help. I just want to ask you a few questions. Go away! Damn it! Leave me alone! You can't have it! - Hey you two, take it outside - Pick up, pick up. You're a tough man to catch, Harold. Holy crap! This is the room, ain't it? What are you gonna do to me? Nothing. Just calm down. - What happens if I open this door? - Without the key, you'll die instantly. Really? Yeah. You with the Order? No, don't get paranoid on me, Harold. Paranoid. Ha! Like nobody's trying to get my comb, right? And nobody's trying to shoot me in the back. Paranoid! I'd have been shot times by now if I didn't have the comb. If you didn't have the comb, nobody would shoot at you. Yeah, well, that's just your opinion, buddy. You've got an object. I don't see you giving it up. My daughter disappeared inside this room, so I'm keeping the key until I can get her back. She disappeared? Yeah. No fooling. Yeah, no fooling. So once I get her back, they can shoot the objects to the moon for all I care. What do you know about the prime object? The what? The prime object, the one that controls all the others. Your aunt barbara was a collector. She must've known about it. Well, I don't know. She never said. You know, don't bother. Objects don't work in here. Yeah, right. All right, make sure you try all of them. Did you get that one there? It's gonna be ok. I'm just gonna reset the room. No! Where'd it go?! Where did it go?! Where's the comb?! Harold, Harold, Harold. Calm. Oh, my God! Harold, I need you to teach me how to use that comb. How do I know when it works? Well, it'll be pretty ob... ... obvious. Oh, look, you did it! You okay? I'm a little dizzy. Yeah, it takes some getting used to, huh? You try doing that three, four times in a row, you're gonna puke your guts out. You mean you always feels like this? Wait, you do that every time? Oh, non, you gotta stop just before you snap back into it, okay? - You stop, okay? - Yeah. And then also, these little buddies. Motion sickness pills. Can't go anywhere without those. Take one. Take two. I'm good. So it just lasts for a few seconds? Yeah, ten seconds tops. Yeah, you gotta use it carefully. Hiding spots are a plus, to let you catch your breath, you know? Hey, you want to see something? You want to try again? Watch this. Try to take that. I bet you can't do it. You can't do it. Go on. Go on, try. You can't do it. Come on. Butterfingers! You see? Everything's frozen. It's like you can't open doors even. You just gotta move and hide. Move and hide, that's it. That's about all you can do, really. Hey, here. Thanks. You're giving it back to me? You gonna run away? No. All right then. Trust me, Harold. I don't want the comb. I just want your help. You promise you won't take my comb? It's all I got. I promise. Thanks, buddy. - Just a phone. - Okay, yeah. Just a phone. Oh, great. Forget something? Yeah, listen, I'm sorry about that. But I'm with our guy. You're kidding me. With the comb? Where are you? Kansas. Well, bring him back. I can't do that. I need some more time. We had a deal, Joe. Listen, I said you could keep it. I didn't say i'd steal it for you. Jennifer, I can't do it. The comb is all he's got. You messed up, Joe. - She's in Michigan. We got her. - Stay on her. Who's that, your girlfriend? More like the ex-girlfriend I never had. I got some of those. Harold, you gotta think. Is there anything that your aunt may have left behind? A notebook, a map, anything. No. Oh. Wait! She did leave something. In the woods. 283, Gotcha. Who the hell are you? I understand that you found my glasses. Your glasses? Yes. Every time I wear them, my car won't start. That's just too bad, cause... I decided not to sell them. Whatever you heard was a mistake. You understand me... dork? Oh! Oh, God! Help me! Somebody help me! Where's she gone? It's been a while. Sorry. I know it's out here somewhere. Overgrown. Oh, there she is. Deer hut. My aunt used to take me hunting out here. Sounds like your aunt was a sweet lady, Harold. Yeah, she sure was. Oh, God. Sorry about the smell. It's been a while. Damn. Ah, still here. She asked me to hide it until... until it was time. - Time for what? - I don't know. Maybe until you came looking for them. - Can I took a look at them? - Sure. "Gallup." Like a horse. No, like New Mexico. Harold, do you have a lighter or some matches? Yeah, I think so. Let's see. Yeah. Thank you. What are you doing? It's an object. No. Is that the prime object? The thing... I don't know, Harold, but thank you. Can I keep these polaroids? Sure. You gonna keep the comb too? Tell him, Joe. He promised the comb to the Legion. No! - No... no. - Joe. I'm not gonna take the comb. - He's using you, Harold. - Wait a minute. Harold, easy, easy! Look at me! Give me the comb. Who's shooting? How many? There's four of them. We're being flanked. - It's the Order! - Stay down! I will bring it back. Take this. Oh, God! Watch out! He's got the comb! - There he is! - You go straight. I'll go around. Don't shoot! Here. You want that? You gonna be all right? I guess so. I'm gonna get a doctor to take a look at it though, just in case. No. You keep it. I don't want it anymore. You sure? I'm sick of people taking pot shots. Keep it. Good luck! You okay? No. I never killed anyone before. I've brought you an object. All right. You're in. Welcome to the Order, Martin Ruber. It's all right. You're not in hell anymore. - Wally. Come here. - What? What I do? You know, it's really no fun for me if you keep bringing them back. Yeah. Listen... You recognize these? This is an object. What is this? What's in Gallup? I give up. What? Don't lie to me. This says Gallup. Your bus ticket takes you to Gallup. It's not really Gallup technically. It's just outside Gallup. Yeah, I know. I was just there. - I want to understand this. - You don't want to know, Joe. If I show you what's there, there's no going back. It won't bring your daughter home. It will make you crazy. I don't have a choice, Wally. I have to go. Now show me. Come on! Remember, you asked for this. All right. So why here? Why the middle of nowhere? It's not the middle of nowhere. It's the middle of everywhere. Everything. Come on. You feel that, Joe? Feel what? That. Like when the objects start to get close together. That... sick feeling. Like a... vibration almost in here. I've been feeling that for a while now. I thought it was just nerves. It's the motel. All the objects. The key, the room, everything, they all came from this place. You knew this was here the whole time? It's a bad place. What else don't I know? The event happened on may 4th, 1961. 1:20 pm. The event? Whatever created these objects. See, the objects want to be put back together. You think it was an accident, us meeting? You think finding the polaroid was an accident? I may have shown you the way, but the objects brought you here. - Where's room 10? - There is no room. Never existed. At least not after may 4th, 1961. You know what that is? Object chart. I've seen one before. Are... you... him? Martin Ruber... Yes. Do you believe in the reunification of God? Do you believe in the truth, the Order, the new religion? Yes. Do you reject your former life? Do you give yourself to the Order? Yes. Then pray. Pray to this object. What is it? It's a piece of God. Like every other object. And I want you to pray to it. If we can reunite all the objects, we can restore the mind of God. We can communicate with God for the first time in human history. - Do you believe that, Martin? - Yes. Yes, I believe. Then open your eyes and embrace the Order. Stupid. Arrogant. You live only because I was once like you. But you will learn, Martin. Thank me for this mercy. Thank you. The motel room key is the most important object to the Order right now. Margaret, I want your group to find Joe Miller and take the key. We can't have another screw up like Michigan. Ray Korey's group in New York and Parchman's group in Cleveland will act as support if necessary. I understand Dr. Ruber knows Joe Miller personally, which is why the job is yours. I don't think Dr. Ruber's in any kind of shape to help us, considering his falling out with Miller. That's exactly why Miller will talk to me. He'd like to kill me. There's no such thing as ghosts. Fine. I'm just asking you. You swear you didn't see her? Didn't see her. - I don't believe in ghosts, all right? - Yeah, me neither, I mean, magic bus tickets, sure, - but ghosts, no. - I've seen the bus ticket, all right? - With my eyes seen it. - Well, I saw her. And whatever she is, she was there. Here. Tape that down. Are you ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. - I feel stupid. Do you? - Just give it a sec. Great. The camera's broken. You know, I might be able to dig it out and fix it. The key's okay. Yeah, Miller. Joe, it's Ruber. We need to talk... about your daughter. What do you want, Ruber? I want to help you get your daughter back. Yeah? Any thoughts about getting Lou back? I've joined a group, Joe. A cabal. They're called the Order of the Reunification. They believe in the objects. They want to use them. Do you have any idea how powerful the objects really are? The Order thinks if they can get all the objects back together... - they can talk to God. - That's insane. Come with me to the Order. Give us the key. If anybody can bring Anna back, we can... together. Someday, Ruber... you're gonna get what's coming to you. Someday you're gonna need me, Joe. I've almost got this thing working. Can you make animal pancakes? What kind of animal pancakes you want? Elephant. All right, I don't know how to make an elephant, but how about a mouse? Elephant. Okay, okay, okay. I got it, I got it. All right, wait. Go back, go back. Slow it down. She's disintegrating. You see, somehow the key brings her back just for a few seconds into our... time and space. What's it like for her the rest of the time when she's not in our space? I don't know. But Anna may be trapped in the same place. I need to find out who she is. You sure you know where you're going? Yes. How much further? I don't know. Not much. - Doesn't seem like much of a shortcut. - Please don't complain to me now. Hey, what's the name of this town? I don't remember. Nobody goes there anymore. Why not? You know, the questions get really boring after a while. I don't know the name of the town, okay? Doesn't matter. What it was a long time ago I don't know.. You're trespassing. Sorry. We didn't know anybody lived here. We're just heading into the town. There ain't a town anymore. Friendly. That's why I don't like coming here. Come on. Come on. Just relax. - Where is everybody? - Exactly. Make an offer. What do you think? Proud of yourself? What's the problem? I've been here a couple times. I... I don't like it in there. Just stick with me a little longer, all right? I'll buy you lunch. Bus station's that way. Not looking for the bus station. I'm hungry. I'd like to eat. Tell you what. I'll just have the special. Turkey, mashed potatoes. Sounds good. Some apple pie, coffee, please. - I'll have two of the same. - Two? Yeah, two. - See why I don't like this place? - Relax, okay? Anything else? Yeah. I'd like to know about that motel. What's the matter? I can't ask a simple question? - What happened at that motel? - Motel's haunted. What do you mean "haunted"? There's these people out of nowhere coming down over the hill thinking they're in Hell. Used to hardly happen at all. Now it happens all the time. All right, what about the woman at the motel? The woman? The ghost? Who's seen her? Nobody, huh? We'll take the rest at the booth. I know I'm not hallucinating, but I feel like I'm losing it. You're losing it? You see these people? They're living a mile and a half from that motel. It's making them half-crazy, and they don't even know why. Most people left a while ago, but... they... a lot of them never figured out... what? There's our ghost. Hi. You want to come in? I don't think so. Better? Much. I want to ask you a question. Do you recognize her? No. Who is she? She's a woman I saw at the motel. The actual motel, room number 9. What's wrong? Joe, don't go back there. - You knew about it? - You wouldn't understand. What wouldn't I understand, Jennifer? That's the guy from the hospice, isn't it? He's my brother. Drew. We all have a reason to get rid of the objects. Drew is my reason. He became obsessed with room 9. And whatever happened to him in there... destroyed him. So, Joe, you promise me you won't go back there. I am sorry about your brother. I really am. But I have to go back, because whatever's happening to that woman could be happening to Anna right now. So I'm gonna find out the names of everyone in this picture, and hopefully I can talk to one of them. Because if I can bring that woman back, I can bring Anna back. I know it. My brother's research on room 9. Yeah. Home sweet home. Jennifer, I... You all right? Yeah. Just don't break my heart. Don't break mine. Jennifer, get dressed. We have to go. What's going on? Get everything. Still here. Whoever made that print was here in 1961. I think my brother identified the people in this photo. They are the collectors. The woman you saw was the motel manager in 1966. Arlene Conroy. Arlene Conroy. The woman in the picture, right? Yeah. What happened to the rest of them? Everyone else is dead. We need to find out who this belongs to. Somebody in there? Yeah, just working late. Who's in there? Pendergast? Yeah, buddy. I've seen this guy. I'll be damned. Who the hell's in there?! Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Who are hell are you? Get out of my house! Gus Jacobs, I want to know about Arlene Conroy. I've seen her. At the motel. Please, tell me what happened. I don't know. I don't know. I wish to God I could help her. She's my wife. My daughter disappeared inside that motel room, same as your wife. She's only 8 years old. Oh, God. - I'm sorry. - Please help me. Tell me what happened in room 9. Do you know how the objects were created? Were you and Arlene involved somehow? No. God, no. How could we? We just... we just ran the motel. That's all. Arlene managed it. I was a janitor. It was just a regular place. It's not like something happened. It's like, afterward we figured something must've happened. The motel only has 9 rooms, right? Except, one day Arlene finds the key to room 10. We tried the key and... well... I suppose you know what we saw. There was still a few objects inside. I didn't want any of it. But Arlene got this look in her eye. She wanted to get all the objects back. She got some of our friends involved. - Pretty soon we were this group. - The collectors. By '66, we had... found almost all the objects. And since there wasn't a room 10, Arlene started experimenting in room 9. And finally she found the watch box. And that's when everything went wrong. What do you mean "went wrong"? It's easier if I show you. This is a copy. The original was stolen... years ago. She looks the same. God, she looks exactly the same. Arlene had been looking for the five objects for years. She said with the right combination she could open the door, the right way. I think she was insane by then. Then I gave her the watch box. And everything went bad. She opened the door, and it was like... like she opened a tear in reality. What the hell is happening? Gus, was this film spliced together? No. It's one continuous piece of film. Arlene sacrificed herself to end it. I saw Arlene a few months later at the motel. Just for a few seconds. She begged me to help her. I couldn't. I didn't know how. I got rid of the key and... I never went back. I changed names. Traveled all over. Eventually I came back. I... I guess I just want to be near her. Gus, what does the box do? May I take this film? Take it. I never want to watch it again. And if you do find my wife, please put her out of her misery. You're not gonna believe this, Detective. We had a break-in last night. Shut up. Someone came in just to use the fingerprint database. They logged in under Joe Miller. Why does Joe still have a login? Well, we've got a lot on our plate, Detective. It's... What was he looking for? Okay. Looks like Joe Miller's headed to New Mexico. I think this must be the box. Well, if the key brings conroy back part way, maybe with the box she'll come back all the way. I don't know. Something's missing. How do I get the box? If you do this, I'm going in with you. There's a woman. She's an object tracker. She won't deal with the Legion, but she might deal with you. Her name's Suzie Kang. Who was it referred you again? I just heard your name around, that's all. - You work for the Legion? - No. Good. Bunch a scumbags. Always trying to hide the objects from everybody. It's bad for business. But they'll get theirs. I'm on my own. And I have the key. You're the new motel man. Joe Miller. Yeah, whatever. Can I see the key? Can I point my gun at you? I just want to see the key. Damn. All right, Mr. Guy. What are you looking for? The box. - Well, that is totally ungettable. - Where is it? You know, I feel bad for you because you're stupid. 1000 bucks. The watch box. Dampens entropy for a limited radius. I must've been absent that day. It prevents things from decaying. Who has it? They call themselves the Order. Very, very nasty cabal. Box was their first object. They based the whole religion around it. Thank you. - I guess if you were gonna shoot... - Shut up and listen. The Order has an object that I need. The watch box. - Where do they keep it? - I don't know. Don't lie to me, Ruber. You'll never get near it, Joe. Then close your eyes. Listen to me, Joe. You can't get the box, but I can. - I'll get the box for you. - Sit down. Joe... I want to see the motel room again. I want to go inside. Why? Because when I saw that room... I knew that there was something in that room that I was meant to see. I don't know why, Joe, but I need to see it. I need to get inside that room. The only reason that you're alive is because I need that box. You get the box, you get inside the room. If I make it out of there in one piece, I promise I will find a way to wake you up. Oh, my god, Drew. The comb. I wanted to let you know I think I found a way to bring your wife back. All you'll bring her is pain. Just let it go, son. I'm sorry. I have to give it a try. Excuse me. - Miller. - Joe, listen. The last object my brother was missing was the comb.</i> I got it back from the Legion. I'll be right there. I have to go. Joe... Arlene didn't disappear the same way your daughter did. Arlene had the key. It was the objects that ate her. It was the objects. Joe Miller, you're under arrest for the murder of detective Lou Destefano and the kidnapping of Anna Miller. Want to make a statement? Do you want to make a statement? Ex-wife, custody battle. They're gonna put you away and run you up. Tell me what happened. I can't do that. You know me. You've been to my house. Our kids play together. I've seen you with Anna. You're a good dad. Okay? This isn't you. Now, let me help you get whoever did this. Lee, I'm telling you for your girls... Drop this case. What the hell did you get yourself into? You know, Lou asked me the same thing, and now he's dead. And Anna? She's alive. And if I have to rip the world in half to get her back, I will. Last chance. Lee! Are you alright? Lee! Damn! Sorry. Get down! Do it now! Do it now! Comply, comply! You got the key, Joe? Yeah, I got the key, Ruber, and I'm armed. Stop! Put it in park. Now take the keys out of the ignition. Now! Jennifer, look away! He's got the deck of cards. Put 'em on the dashboard, Ruber, now! Get out! Get out! Up against the van! - No, no, Joe! - Give me the watch box! - Give me the box! - There it is! Joe? - Joe, take the comb! - Joe! What are you doing?! Joe! Joe! Joe! Let me in! Arlene! Open the box! Have you seen a little girl? I have lost my daughter. She is trapped in the room. Please help me. Are you him? Am I who? The man. The man in the picture! Picture? What picture? Please! Make it stop! - What picture? - Joe! Don't close it! Joe, the comb! The comb! Thank you. I'm not the man in the picture. I'm sorry. I know. I saw your daughter. She's waiting for you, Joe. She said she saw Anna. I don't understand. What happened? I don't know. But I think I know what picture she was talking about. It's this one. What is that? It's the room. Oh, my God. Would you move, Ruber? This must be exactly how the room was in 1961. Just before the objects changed. - What was that? - What? What the hell is that? It's a man. There was an occupant in room 10. Incredible. Let's go. You can't leave me here, Joe. I gave you the box. We had a deal. Come on, Ruber. Oh my God! I'm actually in... the room. He was right here. Feel enlightened, Ruber? Yes. Yes, I am. Objects don't work in the room, Ruber. He stole it! Doesn't matter. Why? The man in the room. Yeah? If I'm right, he's the prime object. And we're gonna find him.
