Joe Miller has found a key to a room not like any other. We can go anywhere? A room of great power. All the objects come from the motel room... - And do they all... - They do weird stuff. A room of great danger. - Anna! - Daddy! My daughter disappeared inside that room. Is there an object that can bring her back? Prime object is what you need. If it exists, it's inside the vault. Do you think you can trust a man like that? His kid is dying. I have my own object I need from the vault : the Glass Eye. It can repair all flesh. People are coming for you Joe. They won't mind killing you to get their hands on these objects. - Do you give yourself to the Order? - Yes. Give me the key, Joe. Detective Joe Miller just shot his partner. Who fired the first shot? Now, to get his daughter back, he has one last hope. The man in the room. If I'm right, he's the Prime object. And we're gonna find him. Anna! Anna! Somebody help me! - Lee, help me! Anna! - Daddy! Lee, help me! Ruber, what the hell did you do to me? How you feeling, kiddo? We're getting close, son. Car's ready, sir. Hey. Did you sleep? No. I just can't come up with anything. You sure these pictures don't mean anything to you? No. I mean, except that the collectors keep showing up again and again. The pictures, the film. But I can't make a connection. I can't either. I just hope they can help us find out who the man in this room was. We're in uncharted territory here, Joe. I mean, no one's ever seen this guy before. We don't know that he actually existed. Jennifer, he was standing right there. We both saw him. And if the prime object is a person, it makes sense that he'd be able to bring my daughter back. Gotta find him. That's all I care about right now. Right. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna take another look at the film. The collectors... disturbed reality somehow. I want to try and figure it out. What? Kreutzfeld sent you after those polaroids, didn't he? He didn't send me. We're working together. What makes you think you can trust him so much? Good morning, Sir. Right this way. Please. Welcome to the Sood's. Mr. Kreutzfeld, my good friend. At last we meet in person. You're early. Never early for business, is it, Sood? No, no, never, never. You go everywhere together? Oh, yeah. Afraid so. Not by choice. I prefer my old life. I was once normal. It's overrated. Sit, please. First edition. Rough around the edges. I'd call it... "Fair condition". A little less fair now. - Just checking it's not an object. - No, no, no. Never objects in my shop, only science. Pictures of objects. Videos, artifacts. No objects for sale. That's... dangerous business. Tell me more. It belonged to John Clark, one of the collectors. Born 1938, - died... - 1971. In the first cabal war. - How do you know it's Clark's? - I just bought itoff his nephew. Had a bunch of stuff in a trunk. No idea what it was. I called you first, of course. I know you have a taste for... collectors' artifacts. Thank you for coming to me with this. I'll of course pay whatever it is you're asking. Whatever price you think is fair. And I shall accept your word that it's genuine. But if at some point I should find out that it's fake, that you tried to con me in any way, or that I hear you've made copies and someone else has one, then I'll have to come back here and hurt you. Mr. Kreutzfeld, my friend. I am the Sood. I deal in science. No fakes, no forgeries, no duplicates. I stake my life on it. No, no, no! I don't have anything to do with that. Mick, what's going on out there? - Is that a way out? - Yes. This way. You need to tread very carefully now. You need to tell me what's going on. I've told you everything I know. I've been straight with you from the beginning. Then what's this? That's the... combination to the collectors' vault, wherever it is. It's what we both have been looking for. In the vault, I believe, is the Glass Eye, which has the power to destroy or repair all flesh. Could be used as a weapon most definitely, but it could also cure my son's leukemia. Can I be any more clear, detective? What about the man? What man? The man in the motel room. Who was he? You're speaking of the occupant theory. People far more obsessed than you have gone down that road. "Who did the objects belong to? There has to be an occupant." Right? I say no. There's no occupant. I've seen him. I took the polaroid to the original motel. I went inside the motel room, and I saw it just like it was back in 1961. And there was a man in the room. My God. You really didn't know, did you? That certainly explains something I've never really understood. Most of the time, in the evidence I found, the collectors referred to their hiding place as a vault. But in two instances, they call it a tomb. You think he's dead? Nobody's seen him. Nobody knows who he is. Trust me. I've done the research. But if there's a body, and the collectors hid it somewhere, it might be in the vault. I got this from Conroy's husband. He's the last living collector. I had it digitized. Unbelievable. The collectors are trying to do an experiment in room 9. Look. They nailed objects to the door. This is huge. It gets weirder. Wh-what's happening now? I think this is where the world almost ends. The original film was stolen. Someone's a step ahead of us on this. I'll kick this up the ladder. Get the legion moving on it. Your lt back in Pittsburgh has been calling. Wants to know how the hell we let Joe Miller escape. I don't know. There's no hallucinogens in your system. You're clean. No, - Martin Ruber did something to me. - I think you should go back home as soon as the doctors release you, detective. Not until I find Martin Ruber. You're probably gonna die... of dehydration. I just thought I'd mention. No! No! I've been promoted. By the Pontifex himself. So your cell will report directly to me from now on. Congratulations, Parchman. Thanks. Should've been you. But you let Ruber steal two objects right out from under you. You know what the punishment is for that. I'll get the objects back. And I'll take care of Ruber. Good. It would be a shame to lose you. Key, clock, scissors. If we want into the vault, we need all three. Between us, of course, we have the key and the clock. It's the scissors. I... I think I know someone who can help us find them. Where did you vanish, Mr. Kreutzfeld? The Sood has security video and everything. Yeah. I had a little lapse in security. He's trying to sell the DVD now. So what are you guys looking for? Scissors. You're pitching slow balls. Ten grand. Cash. Five. - Okay, ten. - Twelve. I think you've tried my patience enough for one day. Zoraida Figueroa. Washington, D.C. She deals crystal methor pop tarts or something. Is she dangerous? The scissors are rarely sought after. But she's had 'em for three years. So she must be doing something right. And what do the scissors do, exactly? They rotate things. So what do you do, spin plates with them? Dude, if you want to theorize, I'm gonna charge you another grand. So Zoraida's apartment is up on the fourth floor. And if she still has the scissors, we should be able to just buy 'em off her. This is a terrific neighborhood. Is there a reason we couldn't just come here through the motel room? It's just it's not that easy. I've never been here before. Besides, I like to see what I'm getting into first. Maybe we should surprise her. Oh, yeah, I wouldn't want her to rotate us till we're dizzy. That's her apartment? Stay behind me. If you insist. Zoraida, I'm... You want something from me, huh? You want some too? Oh, rotates. Calm down. You picked the wrong girl to mess with. Having a hard time breathing? I'll take this. Please. Don't take my scissors. I'm sorry. It's all I have left. Get up! Get... up! Who the hell is that? That, I believe, is the combination to the vault. If only we knew where the vault was. What is this? I don't know. The sun? No, I've seen this before. I'll be right back. Barbara Stritzke had these. The location of the collector's vault is hidden somehow inside those pictures. I'm sure of it. They certainly make no sense to me. Well, it didn't make sense to me at first either, but together they make up a map. A map. Well, a map or instructions. It makes sense if you've used the key. When you leave the room, you have to picture a door in your mind. If you don't, it'll just pick a door for you at random. If you want a specific door, you have to have been there. You have to be able to fix an image of it in your mind. And I think that's what these pictures are for. To take you to the vault without ever having been there before. And... where is "there" exactly? Okay. What do these look like to you? They look like lines. Maybe out of focus. These are bars. And that's a guard tower. You see that? I can't believe I didn't see this before. This is a prison. We find the prison, we find the vault. Hey. Hi. What's wrong? Why do you want this? Why do you need the Legion's files on the collectors? I'm trying to find a way into the vault, with Kreutzfeld. Oh, God. I'm sorry you don't like this, but this is the best chance I've got. You forget, Joe. I used to know Kreutzfeld. I liked him too. But something happened to him. He changed. I trust him. He's gonna kill you as soon as he's done with you. You're putting the rest of us in danger. I'm just trying to find my little girl. I can't worry about the whole damn world. I'm not you. You don't think I wake up every morning... wanting my old life back? You don't get to choose, Joe. No, I don't. I'm not ready to come back to Pittsburgh yet. I need some time off. I'm searching for something. What? What's the matter? Wally, you can't send teenage girls to Hell. You kidding me? Teenage girls deserve it the most. Look, I could've bowled a 260 if those girls weren't teasing me. I can't bowl when people watch. It makes me tense. Seriously, I could go pro if no one was watching. That's great, Wally. Listen to me. I think I found a way into the collector's vault. What, you don't think I can go pro? - Wally... Wally! - You should see my release. What do you think you're gonna find in the vault, Joe? The occupant and the eye. Okay. There's no such thing as the occupant. And even if there was, he's long dead by now. I've seen him. - And I'm gonna find him. - Are you nuts? Do not go in the vault, Joe. Do you hear me? The collectors buried the objects there for a reason. Wally, I have to find him. If the occupant's body is in the vault, I'm taking my chances. What if he ain't dead, hmm? What if he's just sitting there waiting for you? Why are you really here, Joe? I need a favor. This is ridiculous. I mean, how do you hide objects for 40 years inside of a prison? If we're lucky, it's abandoned. How about if it's torn down? How about if it's a golf course now? This is definitelythe door they want us to use. There's probably no other way in or out. Karl... What was the name of the collector who owned that book, the book you got from the Sood? John Clark. He was one of the original... collectors. John Clark. There's something there in the Legion files? Here he is. John Clark. John Clark was a guard at the state prison in Kellogg county from 1955 to 1963. I think we found our prison. Oh, Karl, you shouldn't have. It's what I do. I thought I'd make it easier for us. You're gonna have to leave the flask. Excuse me? We're taking the clock, the scissors, and the key. No other objects. Okay. You should leave the gun, then. Fair is fair. Well, technically the gun's not an object. Joe. All right. And in the interest of complete disclosure, I shall leave behind the cuff link as well. What the hell does that do? Lowers blood pressure. Might be a placebo, but something's working. All right. You ready? Yes. Do you have it yet? Just give me one more second. I think I got it. What are you waiting for? Wait! Karl, hang on! Hang on! - You got me? - I got you. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought we wanted the inside of the prison. All right, ready. Come on up. I guess I owe you one. Forget it, we're even. Well, at least it's abandoned. Yeah, but it's still the wrong door. I can't get it. If I was a vault, where would I be? Well, it's doubtful it's in here. I just can't get a lock on this door. These pictures just don't add up. Wait a minute. If it's in a fall out shelter, it's underneath the prison. Come on. So is this it? Looks like it. It's not a real door. What? It's just painted on. What does this look like to you? It's Conroy, isn't it? No. There's someone else in that room. It's him. It's the occupant. The man I saw in the polaroid. Damn it! Why don't you use the key? No lock. Concrete. Collectors. What does the clock do exactly? It doesn't happen to... drill through walls, does it? It sublimates brass. Sublimates? Turns solids into gas without liquifying. Or vice versa. Sort of like when... dry ice becomes steam. - And the scissors... - Rotate. Yeah, I got that one. There's a seam here. Hand me the scissors. Right. Be careful with these, will you? Thank you. Yeah, nice work. - Did you hear that? - Yeah. What the hell? Good thing you had me leave my gun behind. Starting to have second thoughts about that. What do we got here? Our fallout shelter. Welded shut. Let me guess. With brass. We should step back a little. Why's that? I don't want to breathe in metallic gas, do you? I found what you wanted. Here's the Legion's report of all the objects and their known where abouts. I don't know how accurate that is, but... that's the closest thing we've got. Great, thanks. Oh, my God. Look at this. I don't get it. These are the Conroy objects. The same objects from the film. Karl Kreutzfeld has them all. He's trying to recreate the Conroy experiment. Well, that doesn't make any sense. It's suicide. He'll kill us all. Not if we kill him first. I hope the prime object's in there. I hope we both get what we want out of this. After I get my daughter back, you can have the key. I don't want it. I couldn't have done this without you. Oh, my God. We found it. Joe, nobody's seen these objects in over 40 years. Oh, no. No. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Joe. Joe, my search is over. Well, that's great for you, Karl, but mine's not. Oh, but it is. I can bring your daughter back now. How? How can you bring Anna back? The same way I bring Isaac back. Do you know what the quarter does, Joe? It brings life to memories for a short time. Two days, sometimes three. Oh, my God. My son Isaac. He died nine years ago. This is all I have left. It was enough for a while. Karl, what are you... What are you saying? You're still not seeing the objects for what they really are. They're tools. Tools to reshape reality. The properties that we perceive, they're... side effects, tips of the iceberg. The objects allow us to change reality on levels that our brains can't even understand. Don't you see? Conroy opened up a door through reality itself... Where anything is possible. Listen to me. I saw what Conroy did. And she almost ripped reality apart. But I can do it right this time. I can bring my boy back. I can bring him back to life. We can both bring our children back, both of them! No, Karl, this isn't just about us. - What if you're wrong? - It will work! And what if it doesn't?! Well, everyone will be dead. It won't really matter. Well, I can't do that. Yes. You said you were willing to do whatever it took. I am. But not this. Then I'm gonna need the key, Joe. No. The quarter brings living memories as well. No. The key. Sorry, Joe! Kreutzfeld, you son of a bitch! Hey. You're getting good at that. You okay? No. Thanks for the loan, wally. My pleasure. Uh, your lady friend is here. You were right about Kreutzfeld. I lost the key. I lost everything. I know what Kreutzfeld's trying to do. He's trying to recreate the Conroy experiment. His son is dead. He wants to resurrect him. And now he has the Glass Eye. I'm responsible for that. Listen, Joe, I restored the film, and I saw exactly what happened. Conroy didn't stop the experiment. The occupant did. The occupant? I am sorry. I don't know how to do this, but we have to stop Kreutzfeld somehow now! Let me do that with the Legion. But if we fail, the occupant's our last hope. You have to find him. I don't know where to start. I don't have the key. I don't have anything. Joe, you've come farther than anyone else. You'll find him. We're ready, son. All right, think. What do we know about the occupant? Nothing. The objects all belong to him, so they're his personal possessions. So there's gotta be at least one thing that identifies him or... I didn't even know there was an occupant till yesterday. How would I have any idea if he... What are you... Don't touch... Wait a minute, before it was an object, this was just a bus ticket, right? I need you not to do that. Come on! Do you know how hard it is for me to get that duct tape on there without zapping myself here all the.. Whoa. Look at that. Bus route's right on there. Willowbrook, Arizona. That's where he came from. That's a start, my friend. Pull over here. - Think we're at the driveway? - Right here. - Right here? - Yep, right here. Welcome to Willowbrook, home of the occupant, whoever he is. Well, if I'm right, he disappeared from here in 1961, so I'm gonna check the missing persons reports. Where's the police station? Wally, I'm wanted for murder and kidnapping. I can't walk into a police station. We're at the hall of records. Sheriff, it's detective Bridgewater. You still in town? Yeah, I have a question. Detective Miller and Dr. Ruber escaped in a prisoner transport van. - Did it ever turn up? - Yeah. - Abandoned not too far from here. - Where? Motel sunshine. Just off old Route 66. You know the place? Yeah. Novocaine. Sir? I need novocaine and a syringe. I'll... see to it, sir. What, a man can't sing to his bus ticket? Well, there were no missing persons in 1961, but there was an extra person. What's an extra person? Police arrested an unidentified man yesterday blah blah blah blah. The man accosted Mabel Smith, 24 of Willowbrook, claiming to be her husband. Miss Smith is unmarried. Who's Mabel Smith? She's the town librarian. Oh, help you boys? Mabel Smith? I'm Joe Miller. Can we sit down and talk for a second? Sure. I found an old article that mentions your name. Why are you showing me this? I'm looking for him. I'm sorry. I... I can't help you. Mabel, you filed a police report against this man. You must remember something. It's been so long. He said he was my husband. I never saw him before, but... he knew all sorts of things about me. Things no one knows. What struck me at the time... was that he seemed so sure, so... insistent that I believe him. And do you... Did you believe him? Oh, no, no, no. But he still haunts me. You see... I never married. And, uh... He was as close as I came. What was his name? Oh, I don't, uh... I don't remember. Is there anything else that you can remember, anything at all? I can't tell you how important this is to me. He gave this to me. I've never shown anyone. Now, that's... him, and that's me. But that picture was never taken. I never saw him before he showed up on my doorstep. And this... this is the part that I can't sit with. Yes, that's my handwriting. I still wonder... if I should've said yes. "Yes, I remember." Mabel, may I take this picture? Yes, take it. Thank you. 40 years old, good as new. It's an object. Well, Wally, I think I know why no one's ever found the occupant. Whatever the event was that created the objects ripped him out of the world somehow. Just like the motel room. His history's been erased. No one remembers him. This picture might be the only evidence he ever even existed. Yeah, right. A pencil gets plucked out of existence, nobody cares. But a whole guy... And how do you find a man who doesn't exist? Oh my God! It's real. Bridgewater. Lee, sheriff Starns. Good news. We just picked up your man Dr. Ruber. You wanted to know what he did to you? Why don't you ask him? He's at the hospital. Sood's books. Welcome to Loserville. Any disgusting, wanna-be, coulda-been, has-been object loser hangs out here. It makes me sick to see you here. I need to find something that IDs the occupant. Driver's license, some personal item with his name on it. The Sood's the guy to ask, but... He won't help you now. You pissed him off. Well, I'll apologize to him. Smooth things over. Yeah, that'll work. Come on. Uh, I... I'm... I'm not coming with you. Anymore. Those people, my bus ticket... They're like piranhas. This whole thing, you're getting in so deep, it's dangerous for me, man. I'm sorry, I just can't. You know what, Wally? You're right. Thanks for everything. I owe you. Hey, Joe? Get her back. Hi. I'm here to see the Sood. Appointment only. Look, could you just tell the Sood that I'd like to apologize? Appointment only. Can I make an appointment? No! Well, well. Took me a while, detective. You're a difficult man to track down. - But every riddle has an answer... - I don't have it. You'll excuse me if I don't believe you. Montague, ask yourself, would I be walking to my next destination if I had the key? So what? You're just another object-loser? Well, welcome to the club. That really a gun in your pocket? Yes. Intimidating. You know the Sood? Do I know the Sood? Of course I know the Sood. He's a friend, he's a colleague. We have dinner. Good. Introduce me to him. Sir? Enter. Weasel, how many times have I got to tell you, keep your stinking carcass out of my shop. You too? Pumeet! Wait, wait. Sood, listen. I just wanted to introduce you to my friend... here... I know you guys got off on the wrong foot, so... Kill them. Please, Sood. Hear me out. I want to apologize for the disturbance I caused here a few days ago. My argument was with Mr. Kreutzfeld. And I had no right bringing that argument here. All I want... is to find this man. The occupant. There's a guy object? I mean... There's an object that's a guy? That... that... That changes everything. You can't find any objects with this man's name on them. No, no driver's license. No business card. No such object has ever surfaced. Here... is where all the known objects are right now. Can you find me the pen? Where's... where's the pen? Pen? How accurate is this? It's pretty accurate. I've collected as much history of the objects as I can. The key... for instance... just in the last few weeks, you've been spotted in Pittsburgh, New Mexico, Kansas, - Cleveland... - I haven't been to Cleveland. How far back does this go? Years. Back to the beginning for some objects. What if you mapped all their movements all at once? What would that prove? Well, I'm not sure, but there might be some sort of a pattern. Could you just try it, please? What's that? What's there? No object has ever been through there. Nothing. It's the desert. That's where he is. The occupant in the room. Somehow, he is keeping all the objects away. I need to borrow your car. Great. I'll drive. Give me the keys. This is all I have... Give me... the keys. At the center of the map is a town called Green Valley. Doesn't look like much of a town. From the outskirts, there's a sanitarium. Good luck. We have to hit Kreutzfeld hard and fast. It's not gonna be easy getting in. Leave that to me. I have someone on the inside. Look. None of us have ever done anything like this before. We have no idea what we're getting into. But if we don't at least try, we're gonna end up dead anyway, so... Let's go. What are you doing? Hey. How are you? It's a little project. It's gonna take a while, though. But I remember Anthony said something about making ice cream, though. That wouldn't interest you, would it? Okay. Hey, close the door, will you, buddy? We're in position. Very good. Wait for my signal. Yeah? They're about to attack. Wise man. You made the right choice. No one's here. Something's wrong. I think it's a trap. Get out! Get out now! Let's go. Don't. It won't heal. Objects don't work in the room. Hi. Visiting hours are over. Police business. I'm here to see a patient. Police, wow. Okay, sure. Uh, who's the patient? John Doe. You do have a John Doe here? Yeah. He's always been here. You should empty your pockets. He doesn't like things. What do you mean? Things, stuff. Pens, wallets, keys. Freaks him out. The firearm. Stays with me. My name is Joe Miller. And I just want to ask you a few... Easy, easy. Easy. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay? I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay? I just want to talk to you, that's all. All right? I'm just gonna sit down right here... Okay? No! Stop! Damn. Oh, my God. Who the hell are you? I just want to know who you are and what happened in that motel room. - And if you created the ob... - Stop talking! I met your wife. Mabel. She gave me your picture. She misses you. Even if she doesn't remember you. I felt the photograph coming. I thought maybe... you might've been... you might've been my wife. So I let you through. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Please. It's very important. I just need to know, did you create these objects? I didn't. Then where did they come from? I don't know. I didn't do anything, it just happened. I need your help. My little girl went into that motel room, and she never came out. Can you tell me where she is? She's still there. Where? - In the room. - No, she's not. - I've been there, she's gone. - There's more than one. - What do you mean, there's more than one? - There's more than one. Come on. Can you bring her back? Please tell me you can bring her back. I can't. But you can. How? How can I bring her back? Take me to the motel room. Almost had me there, Jennifer. Yeah, too bad. Didn't think you had it in you. I want you to witness what I'm about to do. I know you're scared of it, but if I'm right... - If I'm right... - You're not. I won't harm you unless you interfere. I saw him. I... saw him, he... I saw him. I've come a long way, Martin. Margaret? Margaret. I saw him. Shh, Martin. I saw the man in the room. What man? I saw him through this polaroid. At the motel. I saw... the occupant. The living... object. This isn't true. None of it. He gave me a vision. In the desert. He told me that the Order was wrong. He said... that if I could put all the objects back together again, that I wouldn't just talk to God. He said... I would be God. That's why you won't kill me, I'm a prophet. Lee. I knew you'd come. Ruber. Don't smile at me like that. I want some answers. Who killed Lou Destefano? I did. What happened to Anna Miller? The motel room took her. You know the motel, Lee. You dreamed about it. How did you know that? The motel room is where the objects come from. And they protect me. I'm the prophet of the objects now. Good-bye, Lee. You're under arrest! Stop, Ruber, or I will put a hole in you! When you're ready to know the objects, Lee, come find me. It's ready. I'm nervous, Anthony. Karl. Please don't do this. I want to see my son. No! Daddy? Isaac. Daddy? Yeah. Isaac, no. No, Isaac. Please! No. Please! Come back! Karl, don't! I want to see my son. Joe, don't! Stop! I feel like myself again in here. Outside... in the real world, there's so much noise in my head. It's quiet in here. Who are you? I used to be a man named Eddie McCleister. Used to be? And now you're... What, the prime object? No, there's no prime object. I'm just an object, like the rest. I have a will. That's the only thing that makes me different. Except you're alive. Yeah, unfortunately. Unfortunately? Outside this room, the objects all sense each other. Always. Like pain. Electricity, noise. For a conscious mind, it's torture. You said I could bring my daughter back. How do I do that? You have to kill me. No. I can't. You can. Even if I wanted to, you shot yourself in the mouth. You... you spat the bullet out. I can'T. You can kill me in this room. Take the burden. What burden? Become an object. Take my place. No, I don't understand. How... how is that possible? One object is destroyed, another is created. Conservation of objects. Eddie, I can't. I... I don't want that. I want to die. If you want to see your daughter again, you have to kill me. Now. Here. In this motel room. No. No, I won't be a murderer. Take out your gun. Please. End this. No. There's a price for everything, Joe. This is the price. This is the price to get your daughter back. Please. I'll get my daughter back? Will my past be erased? Like yours was? I don't know.
