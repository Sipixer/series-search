on the only state land Within hundred miles of here, making it ours. great. why is that a bad thing? Oh, come on. you saw the body. (cho) it's a coincidence. (rigsby) nah. jane taught me one thing... hi. what do we got? The, uh, victim's name is emma plaskett, 19, local girl. First responder knew her from high school. Lives at home with her parents, Has an older brother and a twin sister, maya, Who went missing at the same time. their car was found abandoned last night on the roadside, Ten miles north of here. who's coordinating the local search? Sheriff hardy here is in charge. ed hardy. good to meet you. Lisbon. patrick jane. this is van pelt. well, we called in all our people, And we got volunteers rendezvousing at the station. All our resources are directed to finding the twin sister. Lisbon. Look. Oh, damn. yeah. No, it-it's a coincidence. that's what i said. No. no such thing as a coincidence, not with him. what are you all talking about? who's "him"? Red john. he's a serial killer. this is his style of cutting. Look at the toenails. yeah, i see them. Painted in her own blood, just like my wife. This is red john, and he wants to make sure i was on this case. it's strange, i'll give you that, But you're jumping to conclusions. okay? There's no way we can know for sure... (airplane engine whirring) What the hell? Oh my God. Sync by honeybunny Thx to subs-team.tv for the transcript. Man, this nicotine gum is like chewing on a tire. What do we know about the family? Old money. mr. plaskett's an architect, mom's a sculptor. There's been plasketts in this county Since before there was a county, Which means something to people around here. Been here ten years. i'm still the new guy. (woman) have you found maya? is she all right? Where is she? We don't know as of yet, but every effort is being-- Where is she? (man) they don't know where she is. We have to let them do their job. Uh, can we take a look at your girls' bedrooms? Yes, of course. Thank you. come on, mrs. plaskett. Here it is. We, uh... We tried having them sleep in separate bedrooms, But it never took. They preferred being together. In your professional judgment, Do you think that maya is dead also? yes. We keep an open mind. we're assuming that she's alive. There's always hope. Not much. I see. Well, thank you for your candor. Mr. plaskett? Perhaps your wife needs you to be with her right now. Yes, of course. Why so cruel? Statistically, it's dad that did it. Well, since when do you care about statistics? I just wanted to raise his pulse a little. Hold on. this is a red john case. The cutting style, the painted toenails, the skywriting-- You put it all together, it's hard to dismiss. Yeah, it's red john, all right, but someone else is involved. Else, why would he change his m.o. so radically? Skywriting? He wanted to make sure that the cbi, that you, would be put on this case.</i> He's obviously trying to lure you into some kinda trap. Well, that's part of it, but why take them from a car Instead of catching them at home alone, Like he's always done before? and why two victims at once? Twins? why break pattern? well, he's broken pattern once before. Yes, because it was personal. He wanted to punish me. I don't think these girls are random targets. I think there's something personal behind this. Red john either knows them or knows someone close to them. (engine whirring) (engine turns off) hey. Hey. you the pilot who drew that face over san angelo two hours ago? That was me. how'd it look? clean? Good and round? why'd you do that, draw the face? I-i got an internet order From some company up in san francisco-- R-jay solutions, inc., i think they were called. r-jay? Yeah. they paid the full $1,250 up-front by cash transfer. So what's this about? do you have an address for r-jay? Yes, ma'am, i do, in my office. great. There's a brother? Yes. he's on his way down. he lives up in parkersville. Boyfriends? They had boyfriends, but nobody serious. Anyone at the moment? No, nobody right now. No, it can often be hard for boys to have a chance. They're such a strong couple. But still, very different characters. Yes... if you know them well. Emma... Darker, moodier, the risk-taker. Maya--she's a happier soul, more cautious, Uh... more conservative. Yes. How do you know that about them? Well, i tell you that, uh, only so you'll know That there isn't any point in lying to us. Lying? why would we lie to you? Arden, do you always follow your husband's lead? Do you never struggle against his desire to control? Excuse me? just 'cause you drink too much Doesn't mean you don't have a say. i mean, i should think He's at least half the reason you drink in the first place. Yeah? a good man, but cold, pious. You know, possession of that badge Does not excuse you from acting with normal human decency. quiet, noah. Just be quiet. (arden sighs) (voice breaks) we've been ashamed to talk about this, But for a few months, our girls have been mixed up... With drugs... And the low sort of people that come along with that. Drake, our son, heard that emma Was romaically involved with a dubious character. She denied it, totally. So we don't really know for sure-- Exactly. we do not know for sure. do you know his name? Mace... guthrie. I know a guthrie. small-time thief. Here it is. it's guthrie's place. Nice, isn't it? You carry a gun? No, never. You hang back a tad, huh? oh, yeah, sure. Duke. All right, we're gonna do this nice and easy. (lisbon) okay. Guthrie? (resumes knocking) Come on, guthrie. open up. (barking) (continues barking) (clank) freeze! Aah! (dog continues barking) Whoa. you okay, duke? I'm okay. Shake it off, big guy. (door rattles) That's a very loyal dog. (cho) your store is listed As the mailing address for r-jay solutions, inc. Yes. okay. Suite 121? Sure. Uh, no, ma'am, uh, a suite is like a room or an office. A suite is a box. You're a small company, you look big. Okay, we need to open box 121, And we need all the information you have on who rented it. No problem. you have a warrant? Ma'am, this is a murder investigation. we can get a warrant, but that takes time, And time is of the essence here. no problem. go get a warrant. i'll be here. Following the law. You have a wife? No. i have a niece. Thanks. that's okay. When you come back, i show you a picture. Very pretty. Thank you. Okay, open it up. You got it. (ed) be careful now, duke. (barking) (dog continues barking, snarls) (continues barking) Shh. (ed) hey, buddy. Easy, boy. easy, boy. you got something? (continues barking) (barking continues) (whimpers) Hands up. okay. okay. okay. okay. Ohh, who's a good boy? that's a good dog. (panting) What? Emma and maya plaskett. What about 'em? you didn't hear? What? Emma was found horribly murdered this morning, And maya is missing. Oh, my god. Were you having a sexual relationship With either of them? No. Really? No. never. Maybe hung out with them a couple times. that's it. Mace... I see you care for both of them, And i can see that you're lying to me. That's a bad idea. I got nothing to do with this. Please understand something. i have a very deep personal interest in this case.</i> I'll do whatever it takes. I will have you framed for murder. I will torture you. i will kill you myself if i have to-- Whatever it takes. (sighs) oh, jeez, lisbon. Come on. this is on tape. control your man there. Cut him some slack. look, he's just playing the guy. He doesn't mean it. doesn't he? You know what red john does to him. he can't think straight. He would do all that he said and more, if you let him. I won't let him. Emma and me had a thing. Mm-hmm. she, um, i don't know what she saw in me,</i> but she liked me, you know? (crying) both of those girls had a way about 'em. They look at you like they really see you. (whispers) yeah. So me and emma had been hookin' up for about a month, And i get a phone call, From some guy that i don't know, Saying, "stay away from her or else," And he hangs up before i can tell him to eat it. can you describe his voice? Uh, soft... Quiet. Did you do what he said? No, of course not. I kept seeing her. And then i wake up one morning a couple weeks later, And there's a pig's head lying next to me. I lock and bolt my doors every night. There's no way somebody gets in there, But they did. It's mental. right? The thing is, me and emma were on the down low. Nobody knew. She insisted on that. So how did he know? He must have been spying on her real close. How did you people know? (knock on door) Good morning. morning. I'm drake plaskett. i'm maya and emma's brother. Agent lisbon. this is jane. patrick jane. Have you found maya? No, ma'am. but i can assure you, We're continuing the search with every available resource. Please come in. Where have you been looking for her? I wouldn't know that, ma'am. To clarify, the cbi conducts the investigative aspects. Sheriff hardy is Very ably investigating the physical search. And sheriff hardy will call us if he has news, mom. How can we help you, agent lisbon? You told us it was drake who told you about guthrie. Yes. (lisbon) how'd you know about him? Uh, about a month ago, i'd say, I was staying the weekend, overheard the girls talking, Emma telling maya that this guthrie character was dangerous, And she should be careful. Naturally, i was very concerned. i told my parents. And then we decided to confront emma about it. I see. if you could sit down with us, drake, And give us a statement, it'd be really helpful. Of course. anything you need. I'm just gonna go take another look at the girls' room, If i may. of course. Sure. Lisbon! Lisbon! What? A camera, microphone transmitter. Someone was spying on our daughters? yeah. Who had access to this room? Nobody. just us and janine, the housekeeper. Nobody else? No. nobody. Drake, how's your electronic skills? you're accusing me of this? let's be fair here. you're the likeliest suspect.</i> You can see that. you did say you overheard an intimate private conversation Between the two of them. no, they're my little sisters. i love them. (patrick) no one's doubting that. where were you night before last? At home, alone-- no, wait. Wait. there was a break-in eight months ago. That's right. they broke the kitchen door to get in. They took some cash, some liquor, broke a few vases. We just assumed it was teenagers on a spree. That'd be a good cover. did you report it to the police? Yes, we did, and the sheriff will confirm it. (cell phone rings) excuse me. (ring) (lisbon) hey. We got the warrant. we're about to open the mailbox. Yeah, jane said he wanted to be on the line when we opened it. Okay. one minute. My niece. Beautiful, like a movie star, But well-behaved. Yeah, she's attractive. Oh, yeah. go for it, man. i'm not looking to get married right now, ma'am. Thank you, though. yeah, i'm still here. mm-hmm. you ready, ma'am? (mouths words) Uh, yeah, open up. (clears throat) Okay. uh, it's an envelope. It's typewritten, postmarked hattiesburg, 20th of december, Addressed to roy tagliaferro. "dear roy, i found this address on a business card of yours "that i discovered down the back of the sofa. "and so i write to you today in the faint hope That this letter may find you. if it does..." "and you are reading this, I just want to say that i still love you very much, "despite the very cruel way you treated me, "and i hope you will come back to me one day. With all my heart, rosalind." It's him. I know it. I know it. This roy tagliaferro is red john. We don't know that. Well, we know red john killed emma, So we can assume that red john hired the skywriter. The skywriter was given the order by r-jay solutions. R-jay solutions is ray tagliaferro. Hence, roy tagliaferro is red john. Maybe. This woman, rosalind, has seen red john. Lisbon, she-- she knows red john. This is him. (piano playing classical music) Are you sure this is the right rosalind? there's only two rosalinds in the hattiesburg phone book. The other one's 73 and married. (knocks on door) Rosalind harker? yes? We're with the california bureau of investigation. May we come in? Would you show me some i.d. please? (rosalind) roy tagliaferro? What are you investigating? We're with the homicide and serious crimes unit. What can you tell us about roy? Not a thing until you tell me why you want to know. We believe he could be a serial murderer named red john. No. That's absurd. (lisbon) may we come in? no. No, ma'am, we're not leaving. (rosalind) you don't know him. Ma'am? ms. harker? I'm not listening. i don't hear you. (lisbon) ma'am? Ms. harker? Rosalind? go away. I can't do that. There is a girl missing. Her name is maya. she's 19. Her sister has already been killed by red john. We don't know, but he might have her captive somewhere. This... man, red john... Killed my wife and child. That's why i'm here, rosalind. That's why i can't leave. (sighs) I'm sorry. That's terrible. I'm blind, but i'm not blind. I'm a good judge of human nature. I have to be. I know roy very well. I know him intimately. And i'm sure, as sure as... This ground beneath my feet... I know that roy is a good man. I believe you. Uh, i'm sorry. That's okay. We all make mistakes. god knows. Maybe this red john is just using roy's identity somehow. If we could find roy, maybe he could help us find red john. Roy came to my door one day When his car had broken down off the road. (liquid pours) he needed to use the telephone. So i made him some lemonade, And we got talking about classical music, And... (chuckles) he didn't leave for two days. You two were lovers? Yes. That's very brave of you. I have to be. how long were you together? Roy was in my life for... About five months. He would come and go as he pleased, Said he was doing business in the area. what kind of business? He didn't say. You didn't ask? you weren't curious? No. I didn't care. i don't live in your world. i live here. I was glad when he came, Sad when he left. You said in your letter that he was cruel to you. Very cruel. He left And just never came back. Never said good-bye, Why he was leaving or where he was going. Just vanished. It's been nearly six months now. Can you describe him? Just under 6 feet tall... Not muscular, but not soft either... Short, straight hair... A gentle voice... Rough, strong hands. He smelled of... Pine and... Nails and earth. (chuckles) and he liked to listen to me play the piano. What was his favorite music? Bach. he admired his rigor. Did anybody see him? a mailman, a cleaning lady? No. I lead a fairly solitary life. Did he ever mention any friends, people from work? No. He did bring a friend of his over once, though, For thanksgiving. Dumar. Dumar. any other name? Just dumar. Couldn't believe a blind woman could cook. Came over especially to see. Can you recall anything else about him? He smoked a lot. He said he was trying to quit, but he smoked so much, He had to run out to the store to buy more cigarettes. (laughs) when he came back, He had bought a stuffed toy elephant As a gift for me. That was a good day. Roy came a couple more times after that, And then that was it. Gone. Do you still have it? the stuffed elephant. Yes, i do. First thing in the morning, Check on all the convenience stores in that area. It was a few months ago, But it's possible someone will remember selling the elephant and cigarettes together. it was thanksgiving.</i> Yes, sir. you got it, chief. And don't lose the elephant. she wants it back. all right. You know, it's ironic that she was blind. How is that ironic? Whatever. it's messed up. You know, it'd be funny if it wasn't... not... funny. I mean... (minelli) any luck on this end? Nope. there's nobody named roy tagliaferro Anywhere on the database. it must be an alias. Try the name in english. tagliaferro means "cut iron." Thank you, sir. it's a good idea. Yes, it is. (playing bach's "prelude in 'c' major From "the well-tempered clavier") ¶ (song ends) (beep) Boss, i think i found something. Overnight i set up and ran a code script To search the probate court's realty transaction records. I got a hit on the name "cut iron." Well? We have a good lead. Eight months ago, around the time tagliaferro showed up, And old farm property was bought, called sparrow's peak, And it was bought by cut iron properties. Let's go. Wait. there's more. A company credit card in the same name was used To purpose a large truckload of construction supplies. Nails, earth, pine. he's building something. slow down. We need to find a judge and get a search warrant. sure thing. Judge felton over in eckerville will be the quickest, probably. we don't have time for that. No choice. look, no warrant, no case. We could catch red john, and he could walk. If we catch red john, he's not walking anywhere. he's mine. Don't talk like that. i can't let you anywhere near this case If you start talking crazy like that. crazy? you're crazy if you think you're gonna stop me. Red john is mine. You try to stand in my way, and you--you will regret it. Are you threatening me? no, i am just saying that if you stand in my way, You will-- i've had it with you and your egotistical crap! This isn't about justice or the law or fighting evil. This is about you and your wounded pride. i'm done with it. Eckerville, judge felton. right? Yes, ma'am. If he does anything wrong, if he jaywalks--shoot him. Wow. Steamed up. Yeah. Let's go. oh, hold on. i don't know about that. What if maya's waiting out there for someone to help her? What if she dies while we're standing here doing nothing? All right, let's do it. Right. What's this-- store number ten? 11. (sighs) What a waste of time. It's worth trying. Excuse me, sir. do you have, uh-- Sorry. no returns. Excuse me? you buy the elephant, you keep the elephant. You sold this elephant? Yeah. last year. it was a good item. Comes in elephants, bears, rodents--$9.95. well, last thanksgiving, do you recall a customer Buying this elephant and some cigarettes? No. how would i do that? am i an elephant? You can look at the surveillance tape, If you like. you have the tape from five months ago? Yeah. yeah, we'd love to see the tape, yeah. My son's a big techno-nerd. We got state-of-the-art cameras on a 9-month loop. (parking brake engages, engine turns off) 7654 sparrow peak. This is the place. Let's go. Okay. (cycles shotgun) (keyboard tapping) (sighs) (taps key) There we go. thanksgiving afternoon. All right. where's this elephant? (taps key) (taps key) (taps key) there. Right there. (taps key) (taps key) i see it. (tapping keys) That-- That's sheriff hardy. (taps key) (taps key) dumar is sheriff hardy? (door squeaks) (rattling) (hardy) jane, look at this. huh. (metal clinks) (sweeps floor) (clank) (creaks) Answer the damn phone. (van pelt) cbi. Van pelt, where's jane and lisbon? hey. Following up a lead i gave 'em. why? what's wrong? Oh. (breathing heavily) (click) (breathing heavily) Maya! it's okay, maya. We're gonna get you outta here. She's alive. What are you doing? You act smart, but really, you're kinda dumb, huh? Don't move an inch. I-i-i don't understand. No. (laughs) You never really have. You recall a man by the name of orval tanner? Yeah. Red john's accomplice in his first killing. He was caught. died ten years ago in jail. That's the man. I'm his son dumar. This is the family farm. He was a good man, good father. He wrote me every week until the day he died, you know? Taught me everything i know. and red john? Friend of my father's. And a close friend of mine, i'm proud to say. He doesn't have friends. he has tools. He's using you. Red john... is not using me! He gave me maya. He gave me the woman i love-- The woman i'm gonna marry. love? she's in a cage. Love's cruel. At least she's safe. Not like out there... with those degenerates. She'll grow to appreciate the security i'm giving her. Isn't that right, honey? huh? (pounds door) She'll learn to love me the way that i love her. I wouldn't bet on that. I'm happy for the first time in my life. And red john made that happen, so don't you go telling me He's no friend of mine. and what did you have to give him in exchange? He got emma... and you-- He wanted you badly. He lured you in so sweetly. You just couldn't help yourself, could you? Ha. if only that rosalind woman hadn't popped up And spoiled things. we were gonna get you here Nice and quiet, so we could take our time. Now we'll have to find someplace else to keep you both. But that's life. keep us from what? Oh... Well, you'll just have to wait and see. Hmm? It's going to be so... much... fun. Oh... (laughs) (floor creaks) (lisbon) hardy, put the gun down. Put it down slowly. Crap. Listen, he-- now! He... (groans) (exhales sharply) (clatters) Put your hands behind your head. well, you fooled us, huh? Bravo. you never did go see that judge. damn it, lisbon. You were supposed to wait until red john showed up. i couldn't take the chance. Red john's long gone, anyway. and you faked the warrant argument... Turn around, sir. to lure me into the open. slick. How did you know it was me? don't move. Rosalind mentioned that dumar was a heavy smoker Who was trying to quit. and you--you chew On those nicotine gums all day long. And it was you that staged the break-in At the plaskett house so you could plant the camera. (spits) Bet you think you're pretty cool right now, huh? Oh, yeah. Bingo. Tell you what, girly... don't turn around. You surrender now, and i'll try to persuade red john To kill you quick and clean instead of slow and nasty. Turn around and shut up! (chuckles) (floor creaks above, hatch slams shut) (lisbon groans) (siren wailing) (siren wailing) (both grunting) Boss? This room's clear. Clear! Rigsby! (lisbon) we're down here! There's a hatch in the floor. (metal latch rattles, wood creaks) (panting) You guys okay? (panting) we're fine. We've got maya. call the paramedics. It's okay. Come here. You're safe now, maya. (sniffles) shh... It's okay. Shh. (crying softly) He was here. He was right here. We saved a girl's life, jane. We saved her life. we have hardy, okay? He's gonna tell us what we need to know. Oh, you think so? You should've waited. we agreed on that. What if hardy had killed you right here? And then he would've led you straight to red john. you'd be dead. But you would have red john. I don't think you say what you mean. I think you'd choose life. Well, you think wrong. No. no, you think wrong. Can't you see there's people who care about you, Who need you? You're being selfish and childish, And i want you to stop it. i wish that i could, But, you know, some things you just can't fix. You needn't be angry. it's just the way of the world. We still have hardy. He's gonna talk. he's gonna give us red john. Right. we have hardy. Yes. And we saved a life. Yes, we did. we... We did. hurray for us. (footsteps approaching) (indistinct police radio chatter) (starts engine) (shifts gear) (indistinct police radio chatter) Maya, i'm gonna fill out some paperwork With the forensics people, then we'll take you home. Okay? okay. (indistinct police radio chatter) Do you need anything? I'm good. thank you. (groans, spits) (groans) (clatters) (hardy groans) (grunts) (groaning) (exhales sharply) (hardy groaning and gurgling) (laughing) (snorts) (j.s. bach's "prelude no. 1 in c major From 'the well-tempered clavier, book 1'" playing) Maya! maya!
