19. And... Voil√† - I believe that's the wager. - Pay up. - What's the trick? - Trick? Tell me what the trick is, and I will give you the money. The trick is... I've supernatural powers. It's a 2-headed coin, right? Looks normal. You did something to the coin, right? Come on, man. I gave you 20 bucks. - Can I help you? - Am I in the way? - Kimball said I could sit here. - Kimball? I'm a friend of his. Elise Chay. Elise, yes. I'm Theresa Lisbon. Cho's talked about you. It's nice to meet you. - You must be Rigsby. - Wayne. - It's a pleasure. - It is. I like putting faces to names. I have to ask you... - Patrick Jane is... - Over here. Hi. - I thought he'd look scarier. - He's resting. I was just meeting them. We were getting to the embarrassing questions. And that's why we're leaving. Our reservation's at 8:00. - It was nice meeting you all. - Have a good night. - Let me just get this. - I'll be by the elevator. - Agent Kimball Cho? - That's right.</i> It's Detective Sharon Florey, Oakland homicide. I caught a shooting on the east side. Can you help me? For CBI's assistance, you'll have to run it by the agent in charge. No, I'm not asking for CBI, agent, just you. Why? We haven't ID'd the victim yet, but we got his phone. There were three calls to your number. That bring a name to mind? What's the victim look like? Asian male, early 30s, Prison tats. Gangbanger, probably.</i> What's the address? 1300 Summit Street, Oakland. - I'm on my way. - Thanks.</i> Duty calls? It's a homicide in Oakland. They want help with the ID. You're gonna disappoint that lovely young lady, for a corpse? In Oakland? A job's a job. I come with you. I'll do this alone. Detective Florey. Victim took 3 bullets in the back. Wallet's missing, but I don't think it was a robbery. He still had his phone and some cash in his back pocket. Also this. Mean anything to you? His name's David Seung, got out six months ago after doing time at Folsom. He's a banger, member of the Avon Park Playboys. Avon Park Playboys? - My old gang. - You ran with the Playboys? Seung's only family is his grandmother, - She lives on Telegraph Avenue. - What he'd been up - to since getting out? - No idea. Haven't talked to him in 13 years. What about those calls? He left a couple messages, said he needed help. You find out why? Anything else? We're good. - Thanks. - Thank you. - What's the story? - You heard the story. Why did he call you for help? - Are you friends? - We used to be best friends. He was like my brother. 2x14 Blood in, Blood out</i> Morning. Does that look funny to you? Like, thicker? Why? I'm thinking Jane weighted it on one side, so that it always lands heads. Except when I flip it, it doesn't always land heads. It comes up tails half the time. Maybe there's a technique of tossing it. Not getting enough sex from Van Pelt. - We don't talk about that. - Kimball. Mrs. Seung. It's so good to see you after all these years. What can I do for you? You never visited him in prison, did you? 12 years, is a long time. I told David about you, when you joined the army, when you became a police officer. He always looked up to you. You'll be working to find who killed him, won't you? No, ma'am. The case belongs to the Oakland police. They'll find whoever did this. That Detective woman, She thinks he got killed because he was in the gang. That's not true. It does look like that's what happened. He left the gang. He had a job. He told you he left the gang but doesn't mean he did. He wouldn't lie to me. When I knew David, I heard him lie to you many times, About what he was doing, who he was with. The Oakland police will handle it, okay? Please, Kimball. Won't you help? I'm sorry, Mrs. Seung. I can do nothing. He was a friend? It was a guy I used to know. We'll cover for you if you want to handle it. - Boss won't mind. - I'm not getting involved. He was your friend. He was a gangbanger. Bangers get shot. Not the first guy I knew to get shot. He won't be the last. That's funny. Grandma seemed pretty certain he was no longer a gang member. - She's wrong. - She seemed pretty sharp. Maybe he got shot 'cause he was trying to stop. That happens, doesn't it? Whatever. Oakland's got it. How much time is Oakland PD gonna spend on a gangbanger? Not much. What's your point? There must be someone that can tell us that he was or wasn't in the gang. Just for kicks. Okay, then... Just to... soothe your troubled conscience. So the mean streets, huh? - Your old stomping ground. - You could say that. Stole a car over there when I was 14. Crashed it over there. - Don't wander. - No worries. We're closed. Jon Jon. Is that you for real? I heard you was a cop. I said, no way. Dawg, this is Kimball Cho. I see him. He's a Playboy from way back. Called him the "Ice man." You wanted something done cold, you got Cho. It's still the same. Who are you? Nice to meet you. Great store. Some kind of drug dealership is it, yeah? I read somewhere that... And this is very interesting. The average drug dealer would make a better wage serving burgers. Is that accurate? There's chumps and there's players in any game, bro. I guess. You hear about David Seung? Any idea who killed him? Was he rolling with you guys? Is that what got him in trouble? Why would I tell you anything? I want to confirm it's a gang beef, and I'll go. When David got out of prison, we asked him to put in some work, get him back in the groove. He said no. He was quitting. He quit. About a month ago, he calls and he's all, "I need to talk to K.S. direct." Like he had some kind of deal. So he's working with K.S. and not the gang? That's wrong. Disrespect. You're in or you're out. Ain't no halfway. Right, Ice man? What kind of deal? Don't know. I do know K.S. is seriously mad at you for what you did. He should learn to let go. Thanks. These numbers mean anything to you? Certain? You're absolutely certain? What's with this guy? All right, we're going. Your obsession with eating is an infantile attempt of coping with the persistent anxiety you feel. Now if I may recommend something? A career change. It'll be very good for you. Don't take this the wrong way, who came up with "Avon Park Playboys"? It's not very tough. That's funny. Let's go. Ice man, I know where it comes from, but I just... Tell me you didn't come up with that, you can do better. - What you got? - When David Seung got out of prison,</i> he went to work for a janitorial company in Oakland. Rigsby found where David worked. - Lisbon know? - Got an address? I'm working on it. - What about Seung's girlfriend? - Gimme a hint on the coin trick.</i> - Occam's razor. - What razor?</i> Bye. Let's go pay a visit to David's old boss. - He was a banger. - So he had it coming? Let's go and see his boss, get a second opinion. - And who's this "K.S.," by the way? - He's a gang leader, bad guy. - What'd you do to make him mad? - I shot him. That'll do it. I saw David last night. I was dropping off payroll when he was starting his shift. Did he ever mention the Avon Park Playboys? His P.O. got him the interview. I knew about his past. Why'd you hire him? I don't mind hiring ex-cons. They need a second chance. When they get one, they appreciate it. They're loyal. It keeps turnover down. Hey, you. - Can I help you, Mr. Reed? - Yeah, do your job. The third floor men's room's a disaster. Whole floor's starting to stink. Middle management. Excuse me? You catch more flies with honey. It's a sound business principle, Obviously, one you never learned. Hence, middle management. Have a nice day. He's gone. I started this business thinking it'd be nice not to have a boss. - Truth is, I have dozens. - Do you know what these mean? I have no idea. Not at all? I don't know what else to tell you. - No need. - Thanks. No problem. Good luck. I got a call from Detective Florey with Oakland homicide. Did we decide to take over David Seung's case and nobody bothered to tell me? Because she's hearing from witnesses that you've talked to. We're just pursuing a little independent investigation. - We don't do those. - That's my bad. Checking if David was a Playboys. Ballistics connected the gun used to kill him with another gang shooting a year ago. It was the Playboys. Great. Maybe we should go see this K.S. character? Or not. So I told the professor that the evidentiary issues were secondary to the procedural question. And she looked at me and said, "Hey, your hair's on fire." Hello? Sorry. I heard that. Hearing isn't the same as listening. Are you okay? I'm fine. Kimball, you're talking even less than you normally do. What's on your mind? Nothing. You just don't want to talk about it, right? Right. We don't have to talk. Thanks. On the floor! Take it easy! Get down! Face down! - You stay away from her! - Stay out of Playboy business! She's got some pretty bad bruising but she'll be okay. You'll be fine. Just hang in there. It hurts to talk. Are you okay? Are you coming with me? I have some things to take care of first, okay? We're taking over this case. We'll liaise with the Oakland PD, But we're in charge. I'll look into suspects with the Playboys. Rigsby and Van Pelt will talk to the people at Seung's work. He was shot two blocks away from work. Maybe somebody saw something. Where we going? Why did you shoot K.S.? It's a gang. There's gotta be some kind of rules against that sort of thing. K.S. wanted to do a home invasion. You go in, hold the family hostage and take all their cash. I wouldn't do it. K.S. wanted me on the job. We argued. He pulled his gun. I pulled mine faster, tagged him in the shoulder. That's when I left the gang. Gave my gun to David. A couple of days later, he boosted a car. They pulled him over, found the gun on him. With the possession charge, he got 15 years. You felt responsible because it was your gun. No, I thought he's stupid to have it. Never should've done that. - Then you joined the army? - Enlisted two weeks later. I wanted to get as far away as I could. Told myself I'd never go back. How's business? Jon Jon's gone. - You want to talk, find him. - Where's K.S.? Where's K.S.? Simple enough question, I thought. - Were you serious? - I need to talk to him. Where is he? I don't talk to cops. I'm not a cop tonight. No badge. Now where is he? I'm not leaving until I get an answer from you. I ask you one more time where K.S. is. You don't tell me, I break your arm. You understand me? - Screw you, man. - Let's just reconsider... I can do this all day. Where's K.S.?! Okay, man. You're gonna break my arm. All right. Where are Jane and Cho? I can't get them on the phone, they won't respond. I don't know. Cho wasn't to the hospital. Damn. I went over the list of people working with Seung the night he was killed. Four of them work at the same job site. A financial firm called Cedar Creek Wquities. That's where Jane and Cho went to, right? Go and talk to whoever's in charge. Set up interviews with anyone who worked with Seung. And if you hear from either of them, call me. - What did he call it? - Occam's razor. - What is it? - It's some logic thing. It says you should avoid complexity, when solving problems. What's the link with flipping heads 20 times? I have no idea. Hi. Agent Van Pelt and Rigsby from CBI. Something happen? We need to speak with the director of operations, Adam Reed. Is he in? Not right now. Would you like to leave a message? We need to talk to him. Is he in the building? Sure. But he could be anywhere, And I don't know when he'll be back. You could call him and ask him to come back? Right. I guess I could do that. Bad cold? It's allergies. They drive me crazy. That's K.S.'s house? I'm going in. You stay here, don't move. I'm not going anywhere. We're looking into the murder of one of your employees, D. Seung. That was shocking. I saw him around the office occasionally, And we didn't have any real interaction. I don't, hang out in the men's room. Checking out the paper products. You ever see any arguments between Seung and coworkers? Not with staff. Cleaning crew? You'd have to ask them. And where could we find them? Downstairs. My girl Crystal can help you out. Could you please take these agents downstairs and let 'em talk to all the janitors? - Sure. - And on your way back up, Get me a decent cup of coffee. Thank you. Thanks for your time. You bet. Thanks. Nobody move. Hands where I can see them. Cho. K.S. - It's been a while. - What are you doing here, man? - We need to talk. - Got nothing to say to you. I'm not asking you. In there. Move. Go on. I'll shoot anyone who comes through that door. What is this? - Did you kill David Seung? - Who? Good to see you, too, bro. Haven't changed much. Someone came to my house, hurt my girlfriend, told me to stay out of Playboy business. - That's good advice. - You still mad I shot you? Not mad. - Determined. - I'll shoot you again if you want. Telling me what I want to know. You're not going to shoot me. Try me. You're a cop. You'll do what the man says. I'll do what needs to be done. You know that. I didn't put the beat down on your girlfriend. I didn't kill David. David came to me a month ago, wanted to buy some coke, 5 large. I hooked him up. That's all. - What were you arguing about? - That much weight wasn't just for him. - I figured he was selling. - You told him to cut you in. But he wasn't down for that. Said it was a onetime thing and no more. You're lying. I'm taking you in. Get up. - Not going to a good place. - Shut up. Get the door. Move. Hi. You must be K.S. Very nice to meet you. Let him go. - Drop your gun and I'll let him go. - No way. You. What's it gonna be, Cho? It's on you. Let's just take a breath, think about what we want. - You don't really want to shoot me. - No? My friend and I are cops. No matter how crazy and tough you are, everyone knows what happens when you kill a cop. If you're lucky, it will be lifelong jail. If you're lucky. You don't want to shoot K.S. You do, you'll never know if he killed David. You'll destroy your career. So let's just embrace this moment, and think... about what we want. And just relax. Just... Loosen up and relax. That feels so much better. Get out. Now. Thank you. Actually, I... It's okay... Don't shoot. Just a plastic bag. Nothing to it. These numbers, they mean anything to you? You are one strange freak, man. Okay. I'll take that as a no. We should arrest K.S. and bring him in. There's plenty to hold him on. He'd come in surrounded by lawyers. It's not his first time in an interrogation room. - Besides, I think he's clean for this. - Clean? How? He told you that he sold the drugs to David. Why would he do that? Why would he kill him? What's the motive? That looks good. - Lighter than air. - Why'd you call him? You're an unreliable partner. I nearly got shot. If David was selling, he was using. So, he could have screwed up with K.S. a thousand ways. Seung wasn't using, his tox screen came back clean. No drugs. See? - K.S. killed him for another reason. - Too complicated. Occam's razor says the simplest solution to a problem is usually the correct one. Right? - Right. - Right. So if I flip a coin, and I get heads 20 times in a row, I could have rigged the coin. But if the simple answer is the right one... Two coins. A 2-headed version to flip... And a real coin to show you, my friend. - I knew it. - What's that got to do with David? David bought $5,000 worth of cocaine. He didn't sell and he wasn't using. Think simple. Who got the drugs? Hi, Crystal. What you got there? Where did you get the drugs. Crystal, this is a homicide investigation. Give us a name. Was it David Seung? Yes, it was David Seung. He gave me the drugs. No, you jumped at that a little too eagerly. It's not a good idea to lie to us. I can't tell. He'll hurt me. Has he hurt you before? How? He likes to get high And beat me and then have sex. Crystal, that's sexual assault. He somebody you work with? Crystal, if you tell us his name, he won't hurt you again. Adam Reed. And did Adam get the drugs from David Seung? How? Adam caught David stealing a laptop, and he knew that David had gang connections. So he figured he would know people who had access to good coke.</i> Adam told David he would turn him in unless he got us the drugs.</i> Adam Reed blackmailed David into giving him the drugs? Thank you. That was lovely. Thank you, Crystal. Do you know what these mean? Where... How'd you get those? One for me. One for you. Two for me... Lady, if you don't want to go to jail, leave now. What's going on, fellas? What the hell is this? That's not mine. She brought that in here. It has nothing to do with me. - Sit down. - I don't care about that. You're a true renaissance man, aren't you? Businessman, drug dealer, blackmailer, sex abuser. You talkin' to Crystal? The crazy cokehead? You can't believe her. Don't mess with us. Then there's the shooting of D. Seung. - I had nothing to do with that. - We think you did. You know what these are? 'cause I do. These are passwords to financial accounts of some of the firm's wealthiest clients. David Seung was stealing these when he was killed.</i> The drug buy, that was just a warm-up. This is what you really wanted him to do, wasn't it? You wanted him to steal these numbers so that you could sell them. But something went wrong, and you shot him. You're insane. I had nothing to do with that! You did. Then you broke into my house and you beat on my girlfriend and threw the blame on K.S. No. I didn't. - Where's the gun, Adam? - What gun? The gun you used to kill David. That's crazy, man. I want my lawyer right now. You gotta take it down a notch. We can take him back to the office. We need him to confess. He has to tell us where the gun is. Otherwise, he's gonna walk. - We'll get there. - It'll be fine. You got cuts on your knuckles. You get those when you hit somebody. You went to my girlfriend's apartment. You punched her until she bled. And you killed my friend David. Admit it. - That's from something else. - Admit it! I did! I bought drugs from David Seung. I admit that. So? The rest, I don't know. Last chance. You killed David and you hide the gun. Where? I don't know. Too bad. - Where are we gonna go? - Come on! - Where are you taking me? - Come on. Open up! Come on, man. Open the door! Hello?! - Open the door! - Cho! Somebody! Open up. Open it up! Thank you. Do you know which way they went? - They went that way. - Left or right? - Left. That way. - Thank you! You should use this as a learning experience. What? Please don't. Come on! Quick! Key! You got a key? Quick. Crap! Hell. Cho! Is he dead? Yes. He wouldn't talk. This is not good, Cho. You're out of control. He made me mad. Stay right where you are. Rigsby, put the body in the car. - Put the body in the car! - Right. Fine. Listen. I won't tell to anybody. - Be quiet! I'm thinking! - What's to think about? He didn't confess. If he was guilty, he would have talked. I guess. What do you think, Frank? I don't know anything about it. Really? That's odd, 'cause... I think you lied about knowing these numbers. You're wrong. Cleaning the bathroom, picking up the trash... It must feel pretty good getting rich off their accounts. - I didn't do that. - What's with the gloves, Frank? They're work gloves. You're not working now. Take them off. Go on. Is there some reason you won't take them off? You got cuts and bruises on them? Slow down. This doesn't have to end the same way. Tell us. Tell us the truth. I don't understand. - You shot David Seung. - No, I didn't! You said you were dropping off the payroll this night. You lied to us. You saw what happened to him. I am trying to help you. - Show me your hands. - No. So Jane's right. It was you. Don't make me kill you, too. Tell me the truth. You tell me the truth, and I won't hurt you. I'm not... Stop! I confess! I killed David! Don't let him shoot me! - The truth. - He'll deny it later. I broke into your girlfriend's apartment! I cuffed you! I made you watch! Look. See? See my hands? - Where's the gun? - In the storm drain out front. It's okay. I believe him. Wait. You killed him. He's confessed. You won. You won. You don't have to hurt him. You don't have to hurt him. - You're right. - It's okay. We found the gun. Ballistics are a match. You didn't hire David to give him a second chance. But for steal for you. He was lifting laptops and data. All you had to do was threaten to violate his parole. Why kill him? He was stealing for you. He said he was gonna quit. He didn't want any of it. Said he just wanted to live his life. I thought he'll see the cops. The other gunman, who is he? Tony Wade. He works for me. We're done here. Come on Frank. I apologize for accusing you. I knew you had not committed And for assaulting you repeatedly. That's it? Yes. I thought that was very good. It's incredible. Absolutely incredible. This case won't last 30 seconds in a court. The lawsuits, however, will last for a very long time. Come on. Let's get out of here. Agent Cho, you've made my client a rich man. One more thing. What's that? We've testimony from Crystal Hargrave that will lead to Mr. Reed being charged with several felonies. They include narcotics trafficking, extortion, - sexual harassment... - Never be admitted. Fruit of the poisonous tree. Not even from the same forest. Our D.A. is willing to talk a deal with Mr. Reed. In the interest of mending fences, If he's interested in mending fences with us. - We'll speak to the D.A. - Good. Mrs. Seung. May I come in? Thank you. When I heard David had been killed, I assumed it was because of the mistakes he made, Because he hadn't changed his ways. Yes? I was wrong. You were right. David had changed. David called me... to ask for my help. But I never called him back. When I learned he'd been killed, I didn't want to admit that maybe he'd turned
