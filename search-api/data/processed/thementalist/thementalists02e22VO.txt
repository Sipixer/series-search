This is ridiculous. He goes on in less than five minutes. He's here. Get him up on stage and I'll tell everybody he's on his way. Mr. Brava, We need to hurry. No advance copy of your speech has been released. - Why the secrecy? - Come hear it, and you'll know. Can you tell us anything about what you're going to say? You want a sound bite? Fine. People who traffic in humans are like cockroaches hiding in the dark. - You have to expose 'em to the light. - What do you mean? Will you be naming somebody? I'll be right back. We really have to... Help me! Somebody, please! Andy Burnside. Kane county sheriff. Agent Teresa Lisbon. This is Patrick Jane, our consultant. So the victim's name was Hector Brava. He was a do-gooder. Ran an organization called the Sheltering Light foundation. They fight human trafficking. He was supposed to give some kind of a speech. - So you're the psychic, huh? - No. No such thing as psychics. Looks like cause of death is blunt force trauma. Yeah, some of my men found a fire extinguisher with blood. No, usable prints on it, though. What was he doing back here? This. It's a text message. "Meet me through the staff door. Carmen." - Tracking the sender now. - How many Carmen have you ID'd? Two employees at the hotel, another two were attending the conference. They all have alibis, though. We're gonna keep looking. He had his wallet on him, all credit cards, a lot of money, so you can rule robbery out. Maybe. Where's his speech? You said he was going to give a speech. Wouldn't he have that speech on his person, or notes at least? Did you find anything? - Find out everything about the speech. - You got it. What? There's a contradiction here. The murder itself feels improvised. The fire extinguisher, the semipublic location. But the setup... The text message was planned. No robbery to speak of. No assault other than the blow to the head. It doesn't feel like an anger killing. But more like an act of desperation. The murderer wanted to keep Brava from doing something or saying something. That's just what our psychic said. - Your psychic? - Kristina Frye. You're kidding. What, you've heard of her? Relax. Don't force the memory. It'll come, and the details will emerge. How much you paying her? - None of your business. - That much? I'm working for the wrong people. Nice to see you again. You, too. Thank you. You got the sheriff wrapped around your finger. He's a man with an admirably - open mind. - He's also a man that likes to watch television with a cat curled up asleep on his lap while his mother knits. But I'm sure he'd prefer that to remain a secret. I thought you said you weren't psychic. He is. He's just not ready to accept it. Actually, it was the cat hair on your pants, lack of wedding ring and your general live-with-mom vibe. But if you want to believe that his dead uncle Harry came down and whispered it in my ear, be my guest Don't you get tired of your cynicism? Weary as hell. What's the alternative? Why don't we give them a little bit of time? Sorry about the mom thing. 2x22 ~ Red Letter ~ I have a question. What are you doing working with the cops? You were a spiritual psychoanalyst. Did your patients catch on to you? I still have my practice. Why, you looking for a therapist? Let me think about that. I heard that psychoanalysts are a disease that present themselves as a cure. And on top of that, you add in ghosts. Reflexive mockery, a sign of a troubled soul. You got bored, didn't you? Got too easy taking their money. I think our gift obliges us to help other people. Is that what you think? Our gift gives us an obligation to help. I like that line. I'm gonna use it. Van pelt says there's a problem tracing the message - that Brava got. - What? The trail leads to an electronic dead drop. No way to trace it back. But she's keep looking, - run down those calls. - And the speech? No word yet on if he had it on him or not. But we haven't talked to the wife She's inside. Hector and I knew something like this might happen. He said there was too much at stake to waste time worrying. What were you worried about? The traffickers. People who profit from the enslavement of others. Hector was tireless in his pursuit of them. Is there anyone you can think of who may have wanted to kill him? My husband's received half a dozen death threats since Christmas. If you're asking for names, we didn't make a habit of filing the notes. He was gonna give a speech today. Did he have it on him? Yes. Why? There was some secrecy surrounding it. Do you know anything? No, I didn't. That wasn't unusual. Hector rarely shared the details of his work with me. His way of protecting me. The person you need to talk to is Russell Bigelow. He did research for Hector. You've been told who I am and what I do? My communication with the other side is like a long-distance phone call with a bad connection. So often the messages I receive are meaningless to me, but not to those with ones who've passed over, okay? I'm really not big on this... - supernatural stuff. - You're not alone. Your husband wants me to remind you of something... that will make you smile... I'm getting an image of... Cherry blossoms? Does that mean anything to you? We were married under a cherry tree. How could you know that? He can recall foliage from his wedding day, but he can't tell you who killed him? Crossing over to the other side can be confusing. It's a bit like waking up from anesthesia. Sometimes it can take a while to get real clarity. Makes sense. Carmen, mean anything to you? The opera. Why? That's pretty. My turn. Did your husband ever cheat on you? Did you cheat on him? Why? You're very noble and dignified. Very stoic. A Jackie o. Thing going on there. Maybe you don't give a crap. Maybe you're happy he's dead. Maybe not. I'd like you to leave. Good idea. Jane, enough fun. Let's go. Thank you for the tea. Very tasty. Nice work. She was hiding something. I wanted to see what. What'd you learn? - It's early days. - She's got a good arm. Did learn that. I'm not so sure this is such a good idea I talk about this stuff. I'm just a researcher, you know? We understand that you're frightened, but we really need - to know what was in that speech. - You don't understand. Trafficking generates billions. There are governments behind this stuff. It's like they can get to anybody. Hector's death proves that. We can protect you. Only if you tell us. If you don't help us, then all the work that you've done to stop these guys will be for nothing. Traffickers use quasi-legit businesses to launder their money around the world. I watch audit trails. We made a connection. That's what's in Hector's speech. What connection? Have you ever heard of the world anti-trafficking coalition? - One of the backers of the conference? - A major charity. It's run by a guy named Christopher Lynch. They assisted us in shutting down a bunch of networks, but the trafficking continued. The money just went someplace else. It took a while to trace it, but we found out the coalition is a front for a trafficking group. They used us to shut down their own competition, building themselves a monopoly. Here. - That the speech? - My copy. Why didn't you notify the authorities - once you found what was going on? - 'cause hector said that he wanted to denounce Lynch himself, in public. I said it was too dangerous, but he just wouldn't listen. Did Brava ever mention anybody named Carmen to you? No, not to me. Why? Bigelow is saying that the people fighting human trafficking were traffickers. - Apparently. - All right. You and Cho talk to Lynch. - See what he has to say. - Okay, you got it. Are you guys joking? Because your humor's in bad taste. Hector was a colleague and a good friend. Who was planning to give a speech that would identify your coalition as a front for human traffickers. He named you specifically. Someone is leading you down the garden path, gentlemen. There's no basis of truth in this. You see that it's in the traffickers' interest to split us up, get us suspecting each other. - Brava went past suspecting you. - Please. Hector saw conspiracies everywhere. - He liked being in the spotlight. - We read the speech. - It makes a pretty convincing case. - We're gonna clear this up right now. I will have my lawyers, give you access to all our records, and you'll see that the coalition has nothing to hide. Does the name "Carmen" mean anything to you? Can you think of anybody who'd want to kill Brava? Maybe only a few hundred people. Wait a second. One thing. Second night of the convention, I saw Hector having an argument with a man named Tariq Sharif outside the hotel bar, and for my money, the argument was about a woman. - How you'd tell? - I know these guys, they definitely weren't having a discussion about immigration policy. How's it coming with Lynch? Says a man called Tariq Sharif was fighting with Brava. - Checking for an ID on Sharif. - I took a look at the records that Lynch's lawyer emailed over. First glance, couldn't find anything on Brava's accusations. I checked Lynch's phone records. He made a single call after we left to an anonymous disposable cell. - Origine? - Here's the weird thing. It ends at a cell tower in the middle of nowhere. - That is weird. - Right? - We figured we'd go check it out. - Okay. Here we go. I got him. Here's Tariq Sharif. I'll see if anybody's seen Sharif. Excuse me. He's by the pool. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Mr. Sharif? Yes? We're with the cbi. Won't you sit down? Well, don't mind if we do. I was just telling Mr. Sharif that his spirit is troubled. There's a wrong that he burns to rectify. Interesting. Hector was an old friend. I... pushed him to take up the trafficking problem. Naturally, I feel responsible. They're great glasses. Could I try those? Why don't you take off the sunglasses? Now. You got a... owie. It was a misunderstanding. He was drunk. It didn't have anything to do with Ilsa, by any chance? It was nothing like that. - It was exactly like that. - You have a strong connection with Ilsa... A bond. See? Ilsa and I were very close. By chance, we found ourselves here alone on the first night. I expressed my deep admiration for her. She returned my feelings but was afraid to act on it. Hector found out. Hypocrite that he is, he attacked me. - How is he a hypocrite? - Because he was unfaithful to her. I did say. You did. You were saying that Mr. Brava was unfaithful? I'm a pacifist, not a coward. You don't strike me without repercussions. I went to his suite the night before he died to confront him. A woman was leaving. It wasn't Ilsa. Was it someone from the conference? It wasn't that kind of woman. She was young, pretty, cheap clothes, I assume she was a prostitute. Far as I can tell, it's the only structure in a half mile of the tower Lynch's call stopped at. - I don't see anything. - Nope. Not a thing. - Think they have dogs? - Probably. Hey, listen. There. You have misread the situation, agents. I am entirely ignorant of whatever it is - that you are accusing me of. - You're lying. We've got phone records. You called your goons to lock those women up so your guys could escape. I'm sorry goons? What goons? And records can be faked. Those women in the truck, that was you. Hector Brava... That was you, too. You're wrong. I weep for those poor souls you found. And as I said, - Hector was a dear friend. - What about Carmen? Who's Carmen? Where's my lawyer? Tough. Sociopath. Wolf among the sheep. He's a caught wolf now. Phone call's enough to connect him to 20 felony charges, not even counting the homicide. He's going away for a long time. She likes you, that one. - Which one? - The blonde one. And you like her. I'm not so sure I know where this is headed. You know it exactly. Do you ever consider dating again? Do you? - How did we get to this point? - I'm saying it would be a good thing. What would? Charging Lynch with Brava's murder. How close are we? - A confession would help. - Why don't you ask one of her spirits? I'm sure they'll provide the evidence that's needed. Where do you go? This case is solving itself without me. I have errands to run. Christopher Lynch didn't kill Brava. The emotion he was trying to conceal was contempt. Lynch didn't consider him worth killing. A deeply evil man, but not one who committed this crime. What if I didn't say "spirits"? If I said "instincts"? Would that be something you could accept? Well, maybe. - They're telling me to come with you. - Are they? Why? The last time you spoke with Ilsa Engels, - she threw a teacup. - A saucer. Not a teacup. Who said I go to see Ilsa Engels? Tell me that you're not. She thinks well of me. I can communicate with her husband. And she'll only talk to you if I'm there. I guess I have no choice but to bring you along with me. You think you manipulated me into coming with you? No, I don't. I think you manipulated me into thinking I manipulated you into coming with me. Okay, I'm just gonna come straight out, and I'm gonna say i'm sorry for the, obnoxious infidelity remarks earlier, and I humbly beg your forgiveness. Sorry. Would you mind talking to us a little bit about Tariq Sharif? He was drunk. He said things he shouldn't have said, and I excused myself from his company. And then your husband punched him. I didn't tell to hit him, if that's what you're asking. I won't pretend I'm particularly sad that Hector punched him. He said things that... He acted like a pig and an ass. A pig and an ass? That can't be good. We need to ask you again about the night before hector died. I had a department meeting. I stayed up in berkeley. And, is there any chance that a woman could've been visiting with Hector that night? If Tariq said that, he's lying. He wouldn't dare say that if Hector was still alive. It's disgusting. Disgusting. I guess I should go. Okay. I still have some business to attend to here, so... Yes, I'm gonna catch a cab out front. Nice call on the cherry blossoms, by the way. How so? The wedding photograph... March '97, DC. March through to April is the annual cherry blossom festival in DC. Patrick, you credit me with far too much cunning. You're very good. Very compelling. Thank you. I'll see you later. Meet me at the hotel bar. Sweetheart, there you are. Join us. I've got us a room, - And our friend here... - Novella. Novella. She's gonna help us explore some boundaries. No, she's not. Work with me, Teresa. You're pretty, well, You're pretty adventurous, right? Because my lady, she... she gets a little out there at times. Gettin' there now. Let's go upstairs and see. You just have to work things out with Howie. Barkeep! How can I help you? Another bottle of the good stuff? No, thanks... You're the pimp? - Not nice. - Well, business manager, then. Concerned friend. Whatever. We'd like to take our little soirée upstairs to a more private location. Novella says that we have to talk to you. If it's gonna be the two of you, it's gonna be extra. Sure. She's paying. I should probably tell you that I am Agent for the California bureau of investigation. She has a gun, too. And handcuffs. - This is entrapment. I want a lawyer. - What you want is to take a look at this picture and tell me if you recognize this man. Nope. Never seen him. But that guy... Him I recognize. He was in here getting a girl just the other night. No. No way. I might not be Denzel, but I do okay. Besides, I couldn't afford a prostitute on my salary. Not for you. For your boss, Brava. Is that something you did a lot of... Procuring women for him? The man's dead. Are you seriously gonna drag his name through the mud? I'm not looking to destroy anybody's reputation. I just need to know what happened. Ilsa was back in Berkeley. He called me and said he needed me to do him a favor. He couldn't go down to the bar himself, because somebody would recognize him. Somebody could've recognized you. Nobody did. I was lucky. It was hard for you. Sure. Sure, it would've been easier if he didn't do it at all, but... all I could do was just keep him from getting caught. Is there anything you can tell us about the girl? I think her name was... Claret. It's French. What did Brava mean when he said he wanted to make it regular? Not, like, actually regular, because he died and all, but every thursday afternoon, it was gonna be. - He had a place up in Oakland. - Do you have an address? Sure. And a key, too. I think it's this one on the left. So would you ever... You know... Pay for sex? No. It's weird, right? Weird? No. Expensive. Check this out. Bingo. - What do you got? - Ce tracked Carmen's phone number. It's an apartment rented to a Sally Alvarez. So "Carmen" was just a name she used for work? She has been picked up for soliciting, once for possession. She skipped on that apartment about a month ago, but her P.O. gave us an address that was good as of last week. Call Burnside. Tell him we're gonna pick her up. There was a Carmen Reyes who called Brava on his hotel phone twice the night before he died. Left her name on the hotel messaging. No record of Sally Alvarez calling the hotel. Home or cell. Where did the call originate from? Sunset Horizon Motor court in San Desidera. A Carmen Reyes checked in two days ago. She's still there. We've got two locations to look for her at. Or we have two Carmen. Two Carmen? - What does that mean? - Means things are getting interesting. As long as it's interesting for you. I'll go with Van Pelt. There's just something about motels. Old-fashioned and illicit, both at the same time. Is that an invitation? Look at you, just showing up like a bad penny. I had a premonition you'd be here. Really? No. Lisbon told me. Upstairs. 204. You know Kristina? Did your psychic powers tell you to come? I did have an instinct you were about to get a break in this case. I think you might have just made agent Van Pelt's day. We're looking for Carmen Reyes. We have two addresses for her. This is just one of 'em. - Her real name is Sally Alvarez. - Wait a second. I know that name. She communicated with me. She's passed over. I'm pretty sure she's still in there. Open it up. Step back, sir. She's down. We found Sally Alvarez. She's been dead for about six hours. Blunt force trauma to the head. She's dead? My god. That's amazing. - Why? - Kristina Frye said Sally passed over. She predicted it. - She did? - Can I have that? Please do not believe this mystic mumbo jumbo. Gullible Grace buried the lead. I was right. - There were two Carmen. - There were? That's right, and we have the real one right here. Carmen Reyes. She claims to be Hector Brava's daughter. A year ago, my mother's diagnosed with cancer. It got bad very fast. She was gone in less than a month. Before she died, she told me Hector Brava was my father. And after the funeral, I wrote to him. I never heard back. I thought maybe he'd forgotten her. I wrote there was nothing I wanted from him, only to meet the man who was my father. He still didn't answer? I saw somewhere that he was delivering a speech here. I thought i'd go confront him. You were angry. - I wanted to talk to him. - Did you? When? The morning he died? The night before. I went to his suite. And? He let me in. He was friendly, until I told him I s his daughter. He got very upset and angry. He said, I could not be his daughter. He said, he already met his daughter, and what kind of scam was I trying to play? He turned so pale and shook all over. He threw me out of the room and locked the door, so I left. That was last time you saw him? On the news, it said what happened. I didn't know what to do. And what about the text message? Did you send that? I don't have a phone. So is she telling the truth? I'm not sure. Brava's spirit is deeply conflicted. I can't get a clear reading. What are you using, dial-up? My question, is if she's telling the truth, why was Sally Alvarez pretending to be Carmen Reyes? I talked to Bigelow. He kept a record of all work correspondences but didn't have anything to do with Brava's personal letters. No way to know if she tell the truth. If Brava's her father, she's got motive. She's not the only one. I could never have children. Is it true? Is she really she's daughter? We don't know, Ma'am. She's agreed to take a paternity test. She might be telling the truth. You think she might be the one that killed hector. Maybe... And then maybe it was you. I have to say, Ma'am, it's pretty hard to believe that you didn't know about his behavior. I knew. Hector was a passionate and heroic man who devoted himself to helping others. His flaws were correspondingly oversized. And his behavior was okay with you? I accepted it. The good in him outweighed the bad. If he'd told me, maybe I could've done something to prevent it. - Maybe I could've saved him. - What for? How could you not want to get away from his serial philandering, from the prison of your loveless marriage? That's not true! I loved my husband, and he loved me! Maybe we can get in contact with him now. You could do that, couldn't you? It would certainly clear up a few things. Would you do that? Would you talk to my husband? Yes, ilsa. - What are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing? Okay, so Van Pelt is bringing Carmen. Rigsby's gonna bring Richard Bigelow. Cho is gonna pick up Tariq Sharif and Stacey. So we're all set. - What's all set for what? - We're all set for, Kristina Frye to contact Hector Brava's spirit. I need everybody connected with his passing. Well, I guess... Just make sure Brava's spirit has a thirst for revenge. He wants to put some kind of a curse on the killer, okay? That kind of thing. And I'll take it from there. I can't do that. Yes, you can. It is a necessary lie. I can only contact hector Brava's spirit and speak as he wants me to. To do otherwise would be to abuse my gift. - Everything okay? - Yep. Everything's good. It's perfect. Are we starting now? - Almost. - I'll just get the door. Welcome. Come on in. Thanks for coming. It was your husband's request. Your husband's daughter. Thank you all for coming. Patrick will be assisting me. So in order for this to work, I need everybody to be calm and focused. I want you to look at the candle in the center of the table. Focus on the flame and concentrate on Hector. He's here. I can feel him. Who do you wish to speak to? The killer's here. Know this... Hector Brava says... vengeance will come. Your blood will spill... Before the rising sun. I sense him. I can almost see an image. It's hazy. It's as if it could just... Hector, wait. Stop. Don't go. Show us who the killer is. There it is. A door. "Employees only." And an empty hallway. Footsteps... Close... Close... I see you. I'm sorry. You scared me to death with that. It's okay. You can relax, Bigelow. It's over. I know it was you that did it. Because I got frantic and I'm fell out? Because you managed Brava's correspondence, you were the first one to read Carmen's letters, yes? You set Brava up on a date with sally and had her pretend to be Carmen, and then you told Brava that he had sex with his daughter. Lord. And then the real deal showed up, you faked Carmen's message, and when Brava walked through that service door, you killed him. And you killed poor Sally Alvarez to cover your tracks. And now you'll pay for the crime you committed. Your blood will spill before the sun rises. That part I'm not so sure about. It came in the mail. Just out of the blue. Just a... Letter describing an affair Brava had 20 years ago, naming the woman and the place. And that came from Carmen Reyes. The real Carmen. That gave you all the facts you needed... Things about the affair that only Brava and Carmen's mother would know. - Right? - Yeah. So why'd you do it? Why put a man through that kind of suffering? Was it the money? Or did you just like having Brava in your power? Do you know I've been running numbers on trafficking for Brava and setting him up on his dates for, like, five years? And do you think that he ever, ever thanked me? Said, "I'm sorry"? Said, "I'm gonna make this up to you one day, Russell"? I knew Sally from a whorehouse up in Northern California. I told her if she pretended to be Carmen, we could blackmail Brava and split the money. The letter just gave us everything we needed to make Brava think that she was the real deal. And he was not one for asking a whole lot of questions, so... - Then the real Carmen showed up. - Yeah. He called me as soon as she left his room, freaked. So I played dumb. But then the next morning, he called me and he said, "we need to talk." - It was pretty clear he figured it out. - And so you went to the hotel and texted Brava from the service hallway. I just wanted to keep him quiet. And Sally Alvarez? You had to keep her quiet, too, right? I was a really good researcher. I bet. Agent Van Pelt, you wanted to see me? Yeah. I just wanted to go over a few things in your statement. Let's go in the kitchen. Nice working with you. You were very good back there. You almost had me with the whole "I can't misuse my gift for fear of what might happen" bit. I did what I said I would. I spoke the words the spirits told me to speak, nothing more. Really? Don't you know me by now? Don't you know I wouldn't lie about a thing like that? Ms. Frye, Thank you. We couldn't have closed this one without you. That's debatable. You're welcome. Although I have to say it looks like the spirits got it wrong. I guess being dead doesn't make you infallible. What do you mean? The killer was caught, and justice was served. Sure. But no blood was spilled. Look, he's right there. - Murderer! - Easy! Come on. That was pure luck. Admit it. - If you say so. - I know so. The dead are dead. You can't talk to them. And yet I do. You're vergood. - I go this way. - Okay. - It was nice seeing you again. - You, too. That's with a "K," right? You wanna go get a coffee? I'll drink tea myself, but you can drink as much coffee as you want. Yeah, I'd like that. I can't right now, though. I have to be somewhere else. Maybe some other time? Some other time. Sorry, not "maybe."
