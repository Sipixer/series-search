Barney sloop? He's got 15 players in the Majors and a piece of everything they make. A million-dollar eye for talent. He spots'em young all over the world, brings'em here, trains'em, Gets'em fat pro contracts. So you played. I played a little. Pitcher? Controlling the action? - Man with the ball. - I stopped. Which you still have unresolved bad feelings about. Now I see it. That's why you joined the gang. Your parents disagreed about baseball, so they made you quit it, crushed your dream. You were angry about it, but you couldn't express that directly, so you joined a gang as an outlet for all that anger. Actually, I tore my A.C.L. Nice try. Parents. It's funny, isn't it. Big regrets in life people keep to themselves? I don't know. I tell people about you. Nice one. A zinger. High and tight. As close as we can tell, the murder occurred around 10:30 p.m. Thanks. No big mysteries, weapon-wise. - Looks like three or four blows. - Rage killing. The coroner estimates T.O.D. around 10:30 last night. They're here, finally. Freddy Fitch, Barney's partner. I want to know who did this, quickly. Agent Lisbon. This is agent Cho. Jane. Anything you need, it's yours. I can't believe it. - This was his garden? - His peace garden, he called it. A year or so ago he got into all this zen malarkey. Who had access to this area? Everyone at the academy, Six players in residence, family members, staff. We'll need a list. Sure. But trust me, no one here w-would hurt Barney. - You discovered the body? - I was out of town yesterday. A high school clinic in Portland. Flew back early this morning, came straight here, found him like this. My god. Run, run, run! Come on! Work it, Scotty, work it! His body's still warm and they'retraining? I said they could skip the workout. They wouldn't. "Hold on to the dream." That's what he told them. Barney was like a father to these kids. Pitching islegs! Look, dad, I'm ahead of you! Seems they have their own fathers. These kids are minors. We bring the dads out to sign off on deals, moral support. Scotty Sinclair and Snake Gallidos. Five drooling scouts coming today. Maybe now isn't the best time. Barney set this up. His last showcase. I'm gonna honor that. It's what Barney would one. I know you gotta talk to them. It's your job, but please. We can let the kids finish. Let's take a look at his house. - How do you know where it's at? - Because this thing is a map of his whole life. Work, garden, home. Zen malarkey. I don't expect it's much to look at a simple bed or a thing or... 2x10 "Throwing Fire" Hey. You all right? I see it. A cigarette case. A cigarette case. Very good. But... What's it made out of, son? What kind of cigarette case, Patrick? What would you say? What's it made of? Sterling silver. Your sterling silver cigarette case back. - Next object would be - The cigarette case... It once belonged to someone very, very close to you. That's right. The boy wonder sees all. The next object, Patrick. Someone who's passed on... Quite recently. Last month. Your grandfather. Your grandmother. She loved you... very much. More than she may have expressed. What the hell was that? "Your grandmother loves you very much"? Did you see her face? - It was beautiful. - No, it was a needless risk. An heirloom she carries with her. That's a recent death, and she's too young for dead parents. - So... A grandparent. - So what? I'd moved on. It's a double act, kid. You don't fly solo. You're always saying, when you're working strong, work strong, be brave. I was working strong, and I was right. There is no "right" if there's no payoff. This is showbusiness, not show art. Your stage clothes are walking by themselves. Wash'em good. That private reading... It came through. You got it? When? Tomorrow. This is a big score, patty. Big enough for us to blow off this outfit, step up in class and get ourselves some new wheels, even. Only one thing worries me. It's you, my boy. Are you up to it? You know I am. Of course you are. The boy wonder sees all. Can you stand up? Can you talk? Now that was talking. He needs to see a doctor. I've never caught a foul ball before. Technically, you still haven't. Cho, you take him. No. I'm fine. - How many fingers? - Six. Haven't we got a murder to solve? You were unconscious. - Jane, you were. - Was not. Your turn. Okay, I'll see a doctor. Excuse me, doctor? I know. Real, live patient. I'm excited, too. Barney lived simple. All work, all the time, 24/7. Left his wife, gave her the big house. A clean, simple life. That's all he wanted. - Barney was married? - Still is Leslie. A piece of work. Like I said, he moved out a year ago. After their son died. He was 3, choked on a balloon. Leslie just fell apart... Angry at barney, the whole world, couldn't get past it. I called her this morning after I called you. She wouldn't even pick up the phone. Bad things happen, and you deal with 'em. Barney did? He put his head down, went to work. Found snake in the dominican and Scotty somewhere in... Kansas. Meanwhile, Leslie is stuck living in a... In a world of hurt. I feel it. Let's check out the wife... Leslie Sloop. Working. Drinking like a fish, picking up strangers, calling Barney at all hours, screaming... I don't get that kind of anger. Her kid died. - Is that gonna bring him back? - You don't have kids. No, I don't. The ballplayers should be heading in. With Barney dead, i'm assuming that you get the, controlling interest in the academy. - What's that got to do with it? - Money... Traditionally a very popular motive. Excuse me? These two had their differences, the gold watch, the Italian suit, I'm sorry, the Taiwanese suit made to look Italian. - I don't have to listen to this. - Not exactly emblems of the clean, simple life. There was a culture clash? Plus what is it exactly you bring to the table? Barney was the brains, the real scout, the star... I mean, the Sloop Academy. Jealousy... motive number two. I killed him. I murdered my best friend. Did you? - Get this jerk away from me. - Seriously, get it off your chest. - You'll feel a lot better. - He was my friend! How did that feel, crushing your friend's skull with that bat? How that feel? - Back off. - I'm just checking him out. And? Ambivalent reading, to be honest. Maybe he did it. Maybe he didn't. But one thing he does understand, that's anger. No offense. - You think I can skip these interviews? - Please. Scotty Sinclair? Doc Sinclair. He's 17. You're talkin' to him, you're talkin' to me. Two, maybe three months ago, I was having control trouble... My slider. Mr. Sloop said I needed to "quiet my brain." We raked together in his garden. It worked. I would never hurt Mr. Sloop. He gave me everything. He brought me here. He hooked me up with great coaches, regular school. And money to live on... An advance, some kind of endorsement deal? Got, like, ten free pairs. Which we're gonna have to pay back if he blows this showcase. Barney cared. He taught us how to handle money, invest it. He taught us how to handle life. Are we done yet? He's supposed to be throwing right now. Right, yeah. Got it. Thanks, Frank. Barney's life insurance payout... $20 million. Let me guess... Sole beneficiary leslie sloop. $20 million... That's a pretty good motive. For $20 million, i'd killyou. Really? No, I mean, kidding. It was a... Joke. Still the machine. Let's go see her. Someone needs parking lessons. Who are you? We're looking for Leslie Sloop. Bitch ain't here, man, and I called the real cops. - Hey, man, what took you? - Hey, Narcisco! - Wait. You know him? - You don't? Narcisco Rubrero... Walk-off homer, game one, world series? Help us out, Narcisco. Where is she? Let's go downtown and get a statement. Hold on, you guys. We got dibs here. She scratched my face. I think I'm bleedin'. She smashes her car, so she steals mine... My lamborghini. Where did she go? I got a gun in that car. It's all legal. I got, like, like, a permit. Narcisco, where is she? I don't know, man. She kept screaming about her little angel. You know, she had to see her little angel. The son... Michael. - She stole my car! - So take it up with the real cops. Lisbon wants us back at the office. Wrong way. What you doing? They say there's no seasons in California, but that looks like fall. No, looks like you need a doctor. I am kind of dizzy. Okay, hotshot. Female, third in line. New mom, recently married. One of her first days out. - He is gonna get her a better ring. - Who is? Members only. They had to get married. That's my boy. You have x-ray eyes. No doubt about it. I'm okay. Snake and Scotty are about to pitch. We can't miss that. Michael, I'm so sorry. What did I do? Mrs. Sloop? I'm with my son. Mrs. Sloop, I'm sorry. We need to talk to you about your husband. No. You need to go. Really, you do. Don't you see? This is private. I don't want to talk. I just... I just... I want to end this. Please just leave me alone. I'm sorry. We can't do that. You have to. Please. Because I... I don't know what else to do. Mrs. Sloop. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I've never had children. I can't even begin to imagine your loss. No, you can't. So just stop. Please just leave me alone. Just stop talking. I'm not going to stop. I can't. My sister. She was just like you. I don't want to hear this. She wanted it to be over... Forher. It was always about her. She couldn't talk to me. About what? About anything. I'm her sister. But she didn't not to me, not to anybody. She just ended it forher. I don't know what else to do. Give me the gun. Put it down. You don't want to do this. Not here. Give me the gun. I'm so sorry, Michael. Come on. It's okay. Not now. You know that. Look, I'm busy here. Your brother's tryout is today. No way. That's my older boy. He's a pitcher, just like Snake. He's just as good, too. But he's 22. In baseball years, he's an old man. These pro teams, they like'em young these days. Like Snake... plenty of time for improvement. We caught a break. The wife looks good for it. What was that? Was that a fork, did he just throw a forkball? It was a slider. We gotta go. We go to take a look at the wife. Slider? You know, i'm still a little dizzy. You go. Really, I'll get a ride. People love driving with me. Couldn't find sunflowers. Not quite the same. Leslie, where were you last night? We went to the movies. I don't... I don't remember which one. You should not take these when you're drinking. It was so loud... there were guns and helicopters and people screaming. There was so much screaming. Darn. These are supposed to keep me calm. Just one a day. That's what the doctor said. That'll do the trick. - Did you go see barney last night? - To see barney? Mr. Zen? Mr. Acceptance? Why would I do that? Tell us about Narcisco. Narcisco? He's one of Barney's players. I sometimes slept with those guys. Did you know that?</i> I did that sometimes to make him mad. He didn't even care. She's going around and around, but I think she's gonna give it up. I thought you were amazing out there today. I just wanted to tell you that. Thank you, I guess. Can I ask you something? I don't have a sister. I didn't remember one.... It just. Came out. What was that? Come on, Scotty! What are you thinkin'? He gets down on him too much. The boy can throw. He can hit, too. Last night in the cage, he dinged me three times off my slider. Nobody touches my slider. That man is gonna kill the golden goose. Scotty plays like this now, imagine when he's 18 or 20 years old. He's only gonna get better. It's amazing? There. I spent three long days at that crummy hospital finding the mark, setting up the play. And now... It's time to get paid. We've been waiting for you. How you doing? Go, Cho! CBI! Stop! Get back here! Police! We talked to five bars near the beach. Nothing. After the movies, I had an argument with Narcisco, and I went to Barney's. He was sleeping... In his garden. He wouldn't even talk to me. - Leslie... - I'm his wife! I'm the mother of his child. Shouldn't he talk to me? She was there that night, but he was already dead? If they were at a 10:00 movie, it adds up. She knew he was dead. That's what pushed her over the edge. I didn't kill him. I couldn't, even if I wanted to. What would I tell Michael? You should let her go. Where? Even if she didn't kill him, she needs help. Your pants are ripped. We found a witness with immigration problems. A baseball player. He was very angry with Mr. Sloop. Yesterday afternoon? He was yelling... Loud. He say Mr. Sloop was stealing. And Mr. Sloop... He was very quiet. He was trying to walk away, but the baseball player... - He followed him, very angry. - That's it? Mr. Sloop, he went into his trailer. Then he come out and he show him some papers. And then the baseball player, he got quiet. And that's when I left. But he'd recognize the player if he saw him again. All right, line up facing the mirror.</i> It's the biggest day of their lives. You get that? Barney Sloop had his head bashed in, Mr. Gallidos. Big day for him, too. - Him. - You sure? Him at the end. It's just not true. - Dad... - I've got this. My boy doesn't lie. - If he said he didn't... - I did. I went to see him, all right? But, I mean, I didn't kill him. - What were you arguing about? - I don't believe it. - You lied to me? - Mr. Sinclair, please. I'm sorry to disappoint you, dad. What were you arguing about? What did Barney steal? He's not saying one word, because we're leaving now. Mr. Fitch... Scotty had an argument with Barney hours before the murder. You got nothing to hold him on. Not yet. He had an argument with Barney. He was angry. He lied about it. Who's to say Scotty didn't go back that night and kill the guy? The kid didn't do it. He was angry with his dad, not with Sloop. If you think he did it, then check the cameras. What camera? The baseball field cameras. Snake let slip that he and Scotty were out there last night. Apparently, Scotty handled Snake's slider very well. - You sure you're all right? - Yeah, fine. Security cam. Should be time-stamped. The guy who manages the multiplex in Castine City... He rembers a drunk couple fighting in the lobby. The woman was screaming about the movie being too loud. 10:00 show. Sound familiar? Go and show him a picture of Leslie and Narcisco. If he ids them, that lets them out, too. We're clearing people. We're supposed to be catching them. We've tried everything. She finished her fourth course of chemo last week. And then the tumors in her lungs are growing. Cool shirt. Thank you. Now the doctors say there's nothing they can do, just make her comfortable. I know it... Must be difficult. So when I heard about the crystal... The crystal. Does it really work? Will it shrink the tumors? Observe. Decide for yourself. Patrick? Son? I'm sorry. What's wrong? He... It's a stressful process. He just needs some air. Won't be long. Get up and get back in there. - I can't do it. - Get up now. - I can't. - What part? What part can't you do? The gag? That's easy. I did the hard part. I put the money in the tent. - All you gotta do is pick it up. - She's dying. We're stealing from a dying girl. We're all dying, kid. We're all dying. But what we're giving her... Because yeah, she'll be dead by tuesday and needs it more than most is hope. - Do you get that? - I can't do it. All right. You're either with the show, or you're not. You're a loser, or you're someone who plays the losers. And you can't just back out when you feel like it, when it's morally convenient, when you don't have the guts. I've never backed out. I've been carrying you for a long time, and it's not gettin'any easier, son. No one like an aging boy psychic. Short pants don't look so good on a kid that needs a shave. Now... You're gonna need a new act. You're gonna work that out all by yourself? You going solo? Yes or no, boy? Are you with it? Are you with me? Right now. You gotta say. Come on. 7:21... That's the last time we see 'em. Either one of them could have gone back to Barney's. Where you going? Baseball academy, I was thinking. Don't we have to solve this thing? Rigsby and Van Pelt are talking to the theater manager. The wife? No, it wasn't her. The murder weapon was a baseball bat. Baseball bat, baseball academy... common sense. - Do you know who the killer is? - What do you think? You said, "What do you think?", to make me think you do so I'll go with you, but really you don't. Cho? Baseball bat, baseball academy. That's not common sense. Great. We'll all go. All right, fellas, fellas, listen up here a minute, please. Before we start, I just want to say a few words about Barney Sloop. He was a great partner, a great friend to all of us. And most of all, a great friend to the game of baseball itself. Let us bow our heads. Okay then. That brings us to Snake Gallidos and Scotty Sinclair... Barney's last and maybe his greatest discoveries... Two pitchers with huge franchise potential. In a few minutes, guys, you're gonna see the future. Meanwhile, grab some food and a beer and make sure you've brought your checkbooks. What are you doing here? We thought you might be relieved to know that we know you're innocent, so you can relax. Go out there and be great. - You're gonna be superstars. - That's right, baby. Women, cars, adulation, buckets of money all there for you. So who cares if your dad steals a little here and there? He didn't steal. Really? He just set up a new bank account. That's what Barney told you when you went over there and argued, to accuse him of stealing. That your dad opened a new account without telling you. I don't think you're helping here. Yes, you two, you have the gift. The question is this... What are you gonna do with that gift? Play baseball? That's right. You're gonna play baseball. You're gonna sell soap. You're gonna be part of the big machine. Not soap, man. My own cologne... "Snake for men." That sounds good. So we sell ourselves. I mean, what else are we gonna do? I'm just saying be careful that you sell your talent and not your soul. Don't let other people run your lives, not even your dads. And trust me, I know what I'm talking about. Oh, yeah? What's your talent, old man? Me? I read minds, and there's been plenty of times that I've misused that. Read minds, man? Get real. I am real. Just like most people read books, I read minds. What am I thinking? "Holy crap, I hope he can't really read minds. Otherwise I'd be in deep trouble right now." Right? Cho, could you hand me that pencil, please? Scotty, concentrate. Think of your birthday. Don't tell me. Month, day, year. Concentrate. - All right, I'm doing it. - He's messing with us, man. Come on, we need to go out there. I'm reading his mind. Okay, got it. What's your birthday, Scotty? April 10,'92. April 10,'92. Now how much money you want to bet that I can't read minds? You're gonna be a big shot baseball player, make a lot of money. How much of that money are you willing to bet - that I can't read minds? - No way. Snake, you want in on the action? Cho's not going near it. He knows better. Show it to me. No way. Come on. Show it. Okay, that's sick. Maybe he read it somewhere. Snake, it's my talent. You want to try? Your birthday. Just think of it. I got to warm up, man. Let's go. All right. Maybe another time. Good luck. - Thanks. - You, too. - What was that about? - Just confirming a hunch. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just give me a minute, I'll close this thing. My dad hated baseball. You gotta get over that. Probably never would have made the big leagues anyway. This crystal is from ancient Egypt. Its healing powers are legendary. Where there is sickness, it brings health. This may be hard to watch. No, don't! And when the crystal is applied... The burn is healed. The same thing happens with the tumors. They just disappear. I want it. Ma'am, we are here for the next three days. You can have as many appointments as you like. I want the crystal. I want to buy it. That's not possible. I brought cash. I'm sorry. It's been in our family for the past six generations. I can't. Please! I'm truly sorry. Dad, she needs it. Just give it to her! Please! I'm begging you. 10 grand, my son. You were great in there. The crying, that was fantastic. I almost bought it myself. You earned this... every penny. I'm gonna be a little late tonight. The sideshow boys got a little poker going. So... Wish me luck. You left before I got to read your mind. What? Go away now, we got to focus. I was just trying to get his date of birth. March 5,'92. You happy? March 5,'92. That's weird. I got the march 5th bit right, but I got the, year wrong. I'm never off by that much. Five years. What are you doing? That would make you 22 years old. Get out of here. That's the same age as your brother. Carlos, isn't it? Shut your mouth! Get outta here! - Take it easy. - Barney found out, didn't he? He found out that Snake was 22. He was gonna send him home. Shut your mouth. What the hell's going on here? Jupiter killed Barney to conceal Snake's real age. Holy crap. Is this true? I tried to reason with him, but he just walked away. Don't say a word, Snake. No digas nada.</i> He doesn't know nothing. Nothing about what? Holy crap. I didn't do nothing. I'm not saying nothing. Come on. Let's be honest here. We'll let your kid throw. Right, Mr. Fitch? How old are you really, kid? On the bible. 22. You might have a shot... Middle reliever maybe. If you double my cut, he can throw. Deal. Put your hands behind your back. You're under arrest for the murder of Barney Sloop. Man up, kid. Remember to keep the ball low. You get in trouble, throw'em the slider. I just feel a little bit dizzy. I'm just gonna take a knee. I'm good. Strike three. You're out. You got lucky on that one. I struck him out. You set him up with the heater. You don't use it for an out, not in that situation. I struck him out. We'll talk about this later. I'm gonna make our deal. You won't. I hired an agent. Let's go see a doctor. Why? Are you feeling unwell? No, you are. Cho said you almost fainted. I was just pretending. I hate these kind of dramatic scenes. Poor kid. Liar. You just don't want to go to the doctor. What's a doctor gonna say? "You banged your head. Be careful." You might need an M.R.I. Now you're really selling it.
