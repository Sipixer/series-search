You just don't know it yet. - The McLaren looks good on you. - Not tonight. A lot of fellas out there. They've got to sell station wagons, minivans. This? I don't have to sell this. This is the good life on wheels, stem to stern. The trunk's bigger than my first apartment. Liselle. Agent Rigsby, what do we have? Liselle Douglas, salesperson here, age 28. Blunt trauma, numerous contusions, possible skull fracture. No obvious signs of no sexual assault. What? I just love that new car smell. Time of death? She was last seen here last night. Private security did a sweep at midnight, reported the alarm system hadn't been activated. She was probably dead by then. Let's get the body out, see what we find out. You got it. That's expensive, huh? $300,000 retail. Probably get a discount now, though. - Who found the body? - James Kinsey. He's in the John right now. Brad Elias. Who could have done this? None. It was horrible. This is a tragedy. - We're like a family here. - Family. That's cute. Excuse me? You work on commission, right? - Sure. - Then you're not a family at all. You're a gladiator pit. You're a seething mass of primal hostility and mistrust. No. People have the wrong idea about sales. There's a lot of respect among us, right, guys? Clearly you're a top dog amongst this pack here. The question is, who's the fastest runner? Runner? Liselle's clients are gonna need a new broker, aren't they? And I think that my associate, agent Cho here, left her client list upstairs. In your break room. It might be a little ghoulish to grab it up so soon, but it is still up there, and someone, at some point, will... I've got the client list right here. It's evidence. What did you do that for? I have eliminated this man from any suspicion. Too honest to profit from a killing? Too honest to kill. Right? Right. Guys, break it up.
