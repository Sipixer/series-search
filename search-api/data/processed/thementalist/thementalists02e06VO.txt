Local P. D. has stomped all over the crime scene, forensics won't be any use. It's like they don't even watch TV. Every toddler knows this stuff. - Lisbon. How you doing? - Pat. Long time. What's the deal? T.O.D. looks to be yesterday afternoon, give or take. Your standard blunt-force trauma to the back of the head... Maybe one strike followed by a couple of real widow makers. - Length of wood, I'm guessing. - What's on his face, is that glighter? Riding that disco farm boy tip. His family's here. Gonna get ugly, I expect. I'll see you later. Rigsby, Van Pelt, work the body. Interesting. I feel like Jane knows about us. No, he doesn't. How would he know? I know we've been cool. - It feels like he knows. - You're being paranoid. Just because I'm being paranoid doesn't mean that Jane doesn't know. - Tell me you didn't kill him. - I got nothing against him That poor boy is lying there. He's just fool enough to marry your daughter. You're going down, you're dead! Bring it right ahead! That's enough. You step out of my room. Here I am! Back off! We're grieving, you clown! Why don't you back up? You make me, pissant. How's that feel? Nicely done. You're under arrest. Let's go. Sir, let me get this straight. The victim's wife is Donna Hines, and it was her brother Rod Gerber that told you to step back. Is that right? My name is Theodore Luscom. I am a citizen of free California. The so-called federal and state authorities you work for are not legitimate. Therefore, I do not recognize your right to arrest or question me. - Please! - You don't know it, but you people are just tools of the United Nations. We know it. They told us last June, laid it all out. Say what? There's a change of policy. Had a big secretive meeting, told us exactly who we're working for. That, my friend, was an eye-opener. I tell you. - Are you mocking me? - I'm serious. They told us the whole grand plan. Hush. Ignore him, Mr. Luscom. Good stuff. Just ignore me. - Lisbon? - Hey, what's up? You're not gonna like this, but you're gonna have to deal with it. - What? - Bosco. Hi Jane! You're under arrest. What the hell? What are you doing? Poke him up. 2x06 "Black Gold And Red Blood" It's a microphone transmitter located during an electronic sweep of our offices. That is a dedicated receiver to the unit which I found in Jane's desk. Is this true, Jane? You're spying on Bosco and his team. "Spying" is such an ugly word. More just keeping a friendly eye on things. - Did you knew? - Of course not. - I would have never allowed this. - She would never. You understand this is a serious criminal offense? Come on. Eavesdropping is a felony under section 632 of the penal code, punishable by up to one year in prison. How could you be so stupid? He has the Red John case. He won't keep me informed... I have to keep myself informed. I was low-key about it. I could have turned on his agents or used blackmail or... bribery, I didn't. Thanks for your restraint. We can resolve this easily. It's your choice. How's that? If Jane resigns immediately and agrees to never return to the CBI, I will ask the A.G. not to file charges. Boss. You know Bosco has the right of it. Nothing I can do. Nothing I want to do, frankly. He crossed a line. What's it gonna be? Charge me. I'll see you in court. I'm not gonna leave the CBI just 'cause you tell me to. If I charge you, you'll go to jail now, today. And you can't apply for bail till Tuesday. so that's 3 days and nights in jail. That's a new experience. I welcome it. Don't be stupid. This is serious. Come on, Sam. You really wanna do this? I just did. Malloy! He's ready to go. Open two. Hey guys. Hey Pete. You see any vermin out in the corridor there? - Vermin? - Mice. See? Told you. You're paranoid, man. I know what I saw. I know what I saw. The arresting officer advises protective custody. Are you a cop or a child rapist? Neither. What do you need protective custody for, then? I guess I don't need it. Your funeral. They're just playing with you. Stop. Open up number eight. Hi. Nice to meet you. What you in for? Me? Eavesdropping on a state agent. You? They say I raped and murdered a guy, stabbed him to death. - But it's not true. - That's good. We had consensual sex, then I stabbed him to death. You get the top bunk. I like the top bunk. I know. It's sad and it's stupid, but Jane was bound to self-destruct eventually. - We all knew that. - Boss... Let's get back to the case, shall we? Is that the book we found on the victim? Kirby wouldn't win any penmanship awards. - It's mostly illegible. - Lots of numbers. Times, maybe? - Map coordinates. Bible citations. - There's a few names I can make out Jay, Martin. And then on this page... "Vultures"? Somebody's preying on him, waiting for him to die? Preying on him for what, though? - He wasn't rich. - Get to work on Ted Luscom. Van Pelt and I are gonna go talk to Kirby's family. - Rigsby, get on the Hineses. - OK, you got it. So, Ted, tell us about your beef with Kirby Hines and the Gerbers. I get to call you by your first name, too? Okay. I'm Kimball. Ain't you smooth and easygoing. That 10 acres where Kirby died... that was my grandfather's land. 20 years back, my father's brother Roy stole it From us rightful progeny And fraudulently sold it to the Gerbers, who knew. The Gerbers knew he stole it. How much is 10 acres of land worth around there? Hell man, it ain't the land. It's what's under it... oil sands. It used to be worthless. Cost too much to pump out. But with the price of oil sky-high, oil sands are worth workin'. We're talking 50, $60 million to the landowners. So you took the Gerbers to court. Last year. And what do you think happened? You got nothing. Zero. I knew I shouldn't have wasted my time, but the deceit and dishonesty has made me mad. Where were you yesterday? I was several places, Kimball. - We're gonna need a list. - We? I only see one of you. I and the state machinery oppression's gonna need a list. I'll think it over. Some people just don't have that facility. I'm sure your father loved you in his way, he just didn't have the... tools to express that love. You know what, man? I really appreciate you listening to me. Please, Boo. What are cellmates for? So listen. Listening. About the... unfortunate situation with Jane, I want you to know that my beef is only with him. No problem with you or your people. It was a big mistake bringing in a whack job like him, but... that's in the past now. You and me... you and me always had a good working relationship, and I hope that can continue. I listened. So we're cool? You did what you thought was right. I need to think about it before I know whether we're cool. OK, fair enough. Good night, Jane. Good night, pal. And don't worry about tomorrow morning. Why would I need to worry about this? There are some scary people here. They all know you're a cop. How would they know that? I'm not really a cop. Then you'll be fine. Besides, they got real excellent medical facilities here. - Grace, you coming? - Sorry. Is something wrong? I was thinking about Jane. I hope he's all right. He'll be fine. Maybe he'll learn something. Hi. Are you Gail? Is your mom here? You're the police? Yes, we are. Can you take us to your mom? Are you gonna bring my daddy home? No, seetie, I'm sorry. We can't do that. Good morning, everybody. Morning, pig. Thank you for raising that issue. Let me address that. You believe me to be a policeman That is not true. I am not, nor have I ever been one. I do work with the police. I use my skills to catch murderers, Though rarely do I deal. With professionals such as yourselves. What skills? People skills. You show me your skills, little brother. You... You... Are the shot-caller. You come from the bay area. You like to sniff some kind of glue or solvent to get high. You wish you could quit, 'cause you think it makes you - Look weak in front of your peers. - Is that right? Yes, but you needn't worry, Because the way you are when you get high Makes everybody even more scared of you, right? Hell, man. Yeah. I don't think I like you much. If you stop seeing the world in terms of what you like and what you dislike. And saw things for what they truly are in themselves. You would find a great deal more peace. And I can help you with that if you want. Think. Where's the phone? I need to make a call. Over there. Thanks. This is nice. Thank you. - Did you make these? - We both did. - We're keeping ourselves busy. - Delicious. Your show's in the VCR, if you want to watch it a while. We're sorry for your loss, Donna. It's hard. It's hard. Just when things were getting better. Things were going badly? Marriage stuff. Me and Kobe have been together since junior high. - People change when they grow up. - How so? We kind of drifted, I guess. My family, the gerbers... we're very close. It can be too much what with us living here together and all. Kobe got to feeling kind of squashed up against them. He was a lone wolf type. Liked... to be in the woods on his own. Was there anyone, he had a problem with or who had a problem with him? Just me Like i say we have been doing better recently. He's been more honesty with me, opening up about his feelings. - You know men can be. - Yes, we do. Money problems? No, mam, Kirby was a skilled father. Always a good provider and I'm proud of it. And you have the oil money coming in. Yes Mam How much do your cousins get? They say, each of single cousins will get 80,000 dollars of year. I have to point this out, Donna. I get a strong motive here. Kirby is entitled half of your money, if your marriage is in trouble That would make you pretty unhappy, wouldn't it? Our marriage isn't in trouble. Connor tells us there are many unhealed brushes on his body. Which suggests 3 weeks before his death, he was pretty badly beaten up. I don't know anything about that. Next time you feel the urge to get high,</i> Maybe you will see your mother's smiling face. Maybe you will feel more safe and happy. Maybe you will realise that your feeling get from drugs, is illusion. Nothing more than chemicals swaying around your brain. Jane you may change to the visiting room.</i> More later, you are doing great. That's case paper work so far. That's the copy of the victim's notebook. Nothing than Sudoku puzzles. - Still like losting for us? - He's got attitude and motive. The connors' said Kirby was badly beaten up a month ago, at which time he was in custody on a DY and resisting-arrest beef. Could've been one of the lost friends there. Only hans never reported beating, didn't go to hospital neither wife had acknowledge of it. I think Kirby's wife might keep the beating quiet 'cause it's a family matter. That's what's with the father in law now. Kirby was beaten list month? I don't recall that. Judging by the react i asked about her, seems like a family matter. Maybe you and you son Donny got in their marrital problem? Mam, that's way off. Hey, baby cakes. - You okay? Are you sick or something? - Do i look sick? It's not like you walking around in sweats, no makeup, - your hair all up like that. - Excuse me. My stepdaughter's husband just died. I'm grieving. - That's cool. That's cool. - Who's your friend? This is agent Lisbon from CBI, cooming for poor Kirby. My wife Sandrine. - I need to go to the mall. - What's your theory, Sandrine? Who killed Kirby? I don't know. Do I have to have an answer? I thought that was you guys' job. Worth asking. I'll be honest. I'm sorry Kirby's dead, But i'm not sorry my daughter isn't married to a loser anymore. And why was he a loser? He was a buzzkill. The Gerber family's moving on up, and Kirby didn't like that. He liked being poor and whatever. No vision. Donna deserves more than that. Right, Sand? She's a treasure. Agent Bosco, - a word? - Sure. I won't take up your time shooting the breeze, - beating around the bush. - So? We want to talk about Jane. We know that Jane crossed the line. But you help us out here and we'll be extremely grateful. We'll owe you big-time. Okay. I see. Let's say I, reach out for you to do some stuff. What kind of stuff? The kind of stuff that needs to get done sometimes, To take the bad guys down. Keep the good guys walking around. Nothing illegal. Maybe a little rule bending on the download. That's no problem. See, that's my exact point. There is a problem. There's no rule bending in the CBI. You two guys are good agents, - but Jane is corrupted you. - No, he hasn't. So you were ready to bend the rules before he got here? - Thanks for your time. - Nice talking to you. "Vultures". What does that mean? Who are Jay and Martin? You know, vultures pee on their legs to cool themselves. Is that right? Yes, of course. What does "vultures" mean? Vultures are birds. No kidding. Hines was a bird-watcher. That's why he had binoculars. He saw Jays and Martins. And vultures. Got it. Good, so that's a dead-end. On the contrary, it's a breakthrough. I need to speak with Gerber. I've some questions. Rigsby's going to meet him. I'll tell him what to ask him. Where is the funny for me. Can't you bring Gerber in here? Okay, no problem. I'll sort it out. I'll call you back. Jaily! I just want to give you the heads-up. I have a very strong feeling Gerber is gonna be hostile and aggressive towards you. So you should probably be very careful with him. Don't worry. I think I can handle Roddy Gerber. I'm just warning you. He's a very tough guy. I'd like to see him try something, we'll see how tough he is. Whatever. Roddy Gerber? Who wants to know? Agent Rigsby, CBI. I'm on my way, I have questions I'd like to ask you first... Discreetly. I've heard from a couple of reliable sources that you and Kirby Hine were having an affair. Some kind of sexual relationship. - That's a damn lie. - Are you sure, Roddy?</i> Lying to a CBI agent is a very serious offense. I was in the marine corps. Oh, really? Well, that says it all. I'm ex-army. Marine corps suck eggs. But... no point in arguing over the phone.</i> We'll sort this out when i get out. Semper fi, sissy britches. Thank you so much for coming. So, Roddy, tell me about the vultures. - I know nothing. - Sure you do. I don't like your tone. We talking or we playing? Come on. Kirby found turkey vultures nesting on your land, didn't he? He didn't. Turkey vultures are dying out because of a loss of habitat. They're a protected species. - Is that right? - It is. Seriously, you're disrespecting the game. Thank you. One moment. They're protected, Which means if they're nesting on your land, You can't drill for the oil, you don't get rich. - That right? - Yes, it is. When Kirby tells you about the nest, you tell him to show you where the nest is to destroy it. Only he didn't tell you, you beat him up until he does tell you. You shoot the vultures, and you destroy the nest. Bad luck to kill large birds unless you eat 'em. - You didn't eat 'em, did you? - Hell no! - But you admit you shot 'em though, - They're vultures, man. You think i'm gonna give up a million bucks over a couple ugly basterds who eat dead people? No frickin' way. So you shot 'em. I did. Anybody would. I can't disagree. And Kirby? Not me. I kicked his ass, yeah. I didn't kill him. No need. What he gonna do to me? You swear on your mother's grave you didn't kill Kirby? I swear on my mom's grave, i didn't kill Kirby. Interesting. I think you should take lead. It's a female thing. No, it's not. She's female that's all. He's not. You should take lead. Why me? You're always being... too direct. She won't be offended. - Who won't be offended? - Nothing. Well... We were thinking... Thinking's good. About? We asked to Bosco to give Jane a break, but he wouldn't. We were thinking maybe if you ask him to let Jane go, between friends, he'd do it. Why? - Well... - It's obvious. He has a thing for you, sexual thing. Not like an affair. - It's just... - He likes you a lot, it seems... The way he looks at you sometimes. You're mistaken. Bosco has no particular liking for me, and even if he did, i wouldn't use it as leverage for Jane. - Why not? - Because the law is the law. Jane broke the law, and now he's got to pay the consequences. Hi, Jane. I need you to come visit me. Why? We're busy. Please, Lisbon? It's really important. I need to see you. Also a blueberry muffin. Cranberry? They didn't have any blueberry. What's up? Roddy Gerber's innocent. That's it? Pretty much. Well, no. Roddy beat up Kirby so he'd tell him where the protected vultures were nesting So Roddy could kill them, but he says he didn't kill Kirby. And I believe him. He swore on his mother's grave. Interesting, But you could have told me that on the phone. I needed a visitor. So i could get into the visitors room. How I wish I had my gun. Crime-fighting's hard. Suck it up. - That's why we're here. - Dooley Gerber? - I need to ask him a question. - What question? It doesn't matter. Can you keep the guard off me? Could you, please? It's okay. Dooley, you can tell me. The truth is you killed your son-in-law. Isn't that true? And who are you now? That's a very good answer. Thank you. So? What'd you learn? That was a control question. The next question I ask him is the critical one. I don't need my gun. I can just hit you with my chair. I think you'll find it's bolted to the floor. Do you understand what's happening to you? You could get a prison sentence. I understand that you're keeping me in jail in the hopes that you will teach me a lesson. - It's not gonna work. - I am not keeping you in jail. The law do it. The law, as played by Sam Bosco. And you can make Sam Bosco do anything whenever you like. Right. Because he's so in love with me, I can make him do whatever he could. Yes. I was only saying that. Because that's what the guys were just saying. It's total nonsense. Sam Bosco is a happily married man. He hasn't the faintest interest in me that way. I have no influence over him whatsoever. The guys noticed it, too? I'm impressed. He's very recessive in his passions. Hard to spot that he'd kill and die for you. Trust me, you are way off. Interesting puzzle you present. Lies and truth all mixed together. Look, I hope we can get you out of this mess. But it's also true that I do hope that you learn a lesson from this. There are real boundaries in life. These are real prison walls. Only in your mind, Lisbon. Only in your mind. Help! Help! Deputy! We got a man down, man! He ain't moving! Deputy, I got a man down! Help me! Oh, crap. We have an inmate down, level nine. Number eight out like a light. - Did you do this? - No, man, I didn't touch him! He just ain't movin'! 'Sup with him? If I know. He was like this when I got there. Okay, leave him here. I'll call the medic. You guys go get back on post. Got a customer for you. Okay. What are you saying? My hand. Hand? Steve, come quick. We got a problem, Steve. I need help. I need help! Someone! Someone! Help! After you. Help! Somebody! Lisbon, I had a horrible dream. I dreamt that Jane escaped the county jail. I dreamt that the sheriff, the A.G. and the district super. All called to yell at me. Now, you're gonna wake me up, yes? I'm sorry, sir. I have no excuse for him. He is beyond out of line. He's blown it, all right. We have an A.P.B. out. But maybe you can contact him, persuade him to coming quiet. Nobody wants him to get hurt. Contact him how? Persuade him how? You two are close. He'll listen to you. - That's very funny. - Why is it funny? It just is. Hi, Sam. It's me. Where are you? Dooley's house. If you send the sheriff over, I'll have Kirby's killer in ten minutes or so. Jane, you damn fool! Thank you. What the hell are you talking about? You said you had Kirby's killer. Not yet, but I like to be an optimist. You wouldn't have the makings of a cup of tea, would you? - Thank you. - You're welcome. So listen, Roddy told me about the vultures. And what he did to Kirby. How did you cope with that Donna? Your husband being beaten by your brother? How did you feel about that? - Angry. - With who? Myself, my family. Kirby was a good man, and I let him down. No. No, daddy, it's true. I let the money blind me. We all did. - Excuse me. I got stuff to do. - Please don't go, Sandrine. I was just gonna say how funny it is When you have a big family fight, it can clarify a situation. Do you think that happened at all? - I wish. - Maybe Kirby found clarity. Maybe kirby realized how, important it was for him to be truthful. When we found poor Kirby, he had some flecks of glitter on his face. And when I saw you, Dooley, at the prison. You had some glitter on your face, too. Which means you and Kirby were in close contact, to the same woman. A woman who likes to wear glitter. That would be you, Sandrine. - You're stupid. - Often. But I now also see that neither Dooley nor Donna had any notion of this connection between you and he. Which means Kirby was very considerate... Considerate enough to warn you before he came clean about your affair. I swear on my life there was no affair. Sure there was. You were bored and frustrated. He was available. Kirby soon expose you, and he broke it off, yes? He wanted to get out of Sutter Valley. He wanted to start a new life with his wife. The woman that he did love. But first he felt compelled to have to tell everybody the truth, the fool. He was gonna ruin your life over what... some birds? For a beating that he possibly deserved. Why would he do that? You begged him not to tell. You begged him and he just wouldn't listen. This is all a lie. - That never happened. - Yeah, you had to kill him right there and then. It's a lie. It's a lie. I'm sorry, Sandrine, but we have conclusive forensic evidence from our boys at the crime lab. The glitter on Kirby's face covered in your D.N.A., covered. And D.N.A. doesn't lie. I don't know where that came from, 'cause it wasn't me. Police are on their way. I'd be honest with your family, you may not see them for a while. - Oh, please! - Tell me that it isn't true. He made me do it. - He made you do it? - He made me do it! - She'll have her punishment. - Not enough! Patrick Jane, we know you're in there. Come out with your hands up. It's me they're after, not you. And there is no D.N.A. evidence either. That scientific, forensic stuff, it's all overrated. Thank you for the tea. No take-backs. I'm coming now! Don't shoot. Thank you. Jane got a confession from Sandrine Gerber. Case closed. Yeah, the A.G. likely won't make it stick, what with... his key witness being in jail himself. In for a good, long spell once added in the skip charges. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I thought this would teach Jane a lesson. I thought he'd back down or apologize, but he didn't, and now it's gone too far. You gotta let him go. If you drop the charges, the A.G. won't chase it. What if I don't want to do that? Don't make me go there, Sam. What are you saying, exactly? You know what I'm saying. I'll talk about what happened eight years ago. You'd go there? Really? - I don't believe you. - Believe me. Here I am. You would ruin our lives, our careers, over Jane? Does he mean that much to you? He closes cases. "He closes cases." Is that all it is? If you don't let Jane go, I'll talk. That's all. What are you gonna do? Okay, you did good. There's 2 things puzzling me. How did you get out of jail, how did you get a change of clothes? - I'm glad you asked that question. - It was very... - ... simple. - So they let you out, then? They did. Thank you very much. Nothing do with me. So modest. Right, Bosco's so in love with me, he'll do whatever I say. It's a little far-fetched. He does love you. How could he not? But he's not the type to bend his principles over love. I figure it's something more concrete. You must have something on him. - You think? - Yes. Something he did wrong. Something very bad that you know about. Now he's not the type to steal or do drugs, So my guess... he hurts someone. He killed him. He killed a bad guy that he couldn't catch any other way. And you helped him do it. You found out after the fact, and you... let him off the hook because the bad guy deserved it. I'm touched that you would risk your career over me. That means a lot to me. If you're right, and I'm not saying you are, It would mean I broke the trust of somebody I respect and admire for your sake. If it is true, I would hope in the future you'd be a little bit more mature and responsible in your behavior.
