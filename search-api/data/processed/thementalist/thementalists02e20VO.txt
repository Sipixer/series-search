(Clinking) Thank you, Sadie. Mm-hmm. (Water splashing) (Amplified voice) My friends, I am so proud and happy to welcome you to this celebration of my son Xander... the new C.E.O. of Harrington Media. (Chuckles) Where is the little cuss, anyway? Late for work already... not a good sign. (Laughter) - Elizabeth, text him, would you? - You got it. (Amplified voice) Um, I am sure my husband has a very good excuse for his... Ah, there you are, Xander. (Crowd gasping) (Murmuring) (Cho) That's what killed Xander Harrington, and this is where he was attacked. Now the blood trail starts here, right where the letter opener was found. - The deputy coroner says it was a single stab wound to the neck. - Mm. Now the blow sends him backwards. He slams his head, goes down. He's dazed, slowly bleeding out for a good 20 minutes or so, then somehow gathers himself up and goes for help. Coroner couldn't believe he even made it out to the party. Party which was for him. Guy just got a big promotion. Had a wife and kid. How sad is that? Sad. Anything else? Well, according to the victim's father, there was a confidential business file on this desk that's gone missing. - Nothing else taken. - What was the file about? Plans for the "Daily Observer"... newspaper. Debt restructuring, cost cutting, layoffs. Layoffs? Any "Observer" employees invited to the party? So you're reporters for the, uh, "Observer." Xander Harrington... man of the people, huh? Inviting the ink-stained wretches. Xander was a good guy. Did any of you hear about the layoffs that were coming up soon? (Laughs) Layoffs? What layoffs? Well, actually, there's, uh, quite a long list. Yeah. It appears that no one is safe. Must be very scary in the newspaper business these days. That's a very lovely dress. Great color. Well, thank you. (Chuckles) I'm Heather Evans. - Hello, Heather Evans. You're very attractive. - Mm. It's probably why your name's not on that list. Good-looking women live in a different world. Excuse me? What's this list you keep mentioning? Oh, come on, Heather. The list that was in the file that you took off Xander Harrington's desk. Everyone here... we mention layoffs, and everyone here reacts except you, because you have read the list. Oh, that's ridiculous. I didn't go anywhere near Xander's desk. Bravo. Very well played, considering the stress you must be feeling right now. You know, I was hoping to dazzle you all with my uncanny Detective skills, but you force me... you force me to just reveal the humdrum facts and point out that you have blood on your shoes, Heather. (Heather) Wha... (Lisbon) Could you step out of your shoe, ma'am? "Stop the presses"? That's the phrase, right? "Stop the presses." Yeah. Got it. Always wanted to say that. â™« The Mentalist 2x20 â™« Red All Over Original air date on April 29, 2010 -- sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> -- -- for <font color="#ffff00">www.Addic7ed.Com</font> -- Xander Harrington caught you snooping in his office, and you killed him. Now maybe you didn't mean to do it. - You were surprised, scared... - No. I didn't even see him. It was dark. No lights. Curtains were drawn. I went to the desk, I took the file, and I ran. If I'd known he was... My God, I would never have... How'd you know that there was a list at all? Someone told you. Who? A confidential source. And you'll go to jail to protect this source? Ed. Edward Harrington... Xander's brother. He, um... He said there were gonna be layoffs on Monday. I just... I just wanted to know whether or not I still had a job. - It's a very good job. - Not anymore, it's not. (Cho) Tell me exactly what happened from the beginning. Ma'am? Is there, uh, I-is there something specific that you wanted? No. No. Just keeping apprised. Huh. Alex Harrington is the owner of the seventh largest media conglomerate in the world. Yes, ma'am. And you don't want to disappoint a man who owns 200 TV stations and a national newspaper. No, ma'am. Looks like Heather's cleared. Timeline puts her at the bar at the time of the attack. - That's according to several male guests who remember her well. - Figures. Only leaves 196 party guests and 42 staff as potential suspects. Start with the brother. Okay. Take Rigsby. Problem? Nope. Not at all. Ma'am? You're giving my team assignments? I know. I'm sorry. Should've been your call. I just want to make sure those two can hack it. Fair enough. (Lisbon) The head of your security said that the house is fully wired, but the family asked the cameras inside be turned off? Why's that? (Sighs) I take responsibility for that. No, it's my fault. I'm Tara... Alex's wife. This is Ella. And I'm the one who had the cameras disconnected. - It's my fault. - It's nobody's fault, dear. Hush. Why'd you do it? Cameras and panic rooms and armed guards... it's a lot to take. I hated feeling watched in my own home. Seems so silly now. I'm sorry. How long until you take that horrible stuff down? Forensics has promised to release the crime scene as soon as possible. I am so sorry for any inconvenience. (Ella whimpers) (Whispers) Excuse me. Uh, I'm too upset. Uh, m-m-may I? Oh. (Chuckles) Thank you. (Cooing) (Laughs) (Lisbon) So, uh, you and Xander were close? He and Sadie were my only true friends. People seem more interested in befriending your money and connections when you're married to the C.E.O. of Harrington Media. (Alex) Yes, I suppose it can be difficult at times. By the way, it's <i>former</i> C.E.O. - Xander forced me out. - (Lisbon) Really? (Alex) Really. He convened the board, secured the necessary votes. Son staged a coup. Yes. You have any idea the guts it takes to pull that off? Xander proved he could lead. I've never been prouder of him. Proud of, uh, Eddie, too... my other son. (Patrick) Well, of course. But Xander had the strength to lead, the guts. That's important to you, isn't it... guts? Of course. Guts, heart. What else is there? Spleen, liver, kidneys, uh, genitalia. (Chuckling) Lot of important stuff there. Are you being flippant with me? My son is dead. Forgive me. I-I was. Lost myself for a second. Forgot where I was. But, you know, that... that's a very beautiful painting. - Very nice work, yeah. - Can I talk to you for a moment? - (Whispers) Quit that! - What? Poking the bigwig. "Poking the bigwig." Ah, I like it. It's got a nice ring to it. I understand it's a compulsion you're not fully in control of, but I wish you would try. It would make our work a lot easier if you did... try. - Did you see that? - What? Right outside that window. There's a pink unicorn. Amazing! Now you're hallucinating. No. No, no, look. It's right outside the window. Seriously, look. It's a unicorn! I want to see! I don't see a unicorn. It's right there. (Whispers) I'm trying to trick her. Oh. Yes. Yeah. What a nice unicorn. (Normal voice) Yeah, very nice unicorn. So you like to have secret tea parties? How did you know about the tea party? Oh, you know, I kind of like secret tea parties, too. - I'm Patrick. That's Teresa. - Hi. I'm Ashley Harrington. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - You, too. Now who's your mom and dad? Xander Harrington and Sadie Cardozo Harrington. I know my address and phone number, too. Very good. Patrick and I are actually looking for your mommy. Do you know where she is? Outside. We could go cheer her up. Is she sad, sweetie? She misses daddy. He went away on a trip. Mr. Harrington, you prodded Heather Evans into going into your brother's office, didn't you? I told her the file was on the desk. What she did with that information is her problem. You're the West coast head of media operations, and you tell an employee about a confidential layoff list? (Inhales deeply) Well, I had a feeling she'd be grateful. And she was. You exchanged the information for sex. Yes. (Sighs) I did. Gate security has you leaving the party just before your brother died of his injuries. I didn't know what had happened, and I didn't particularly want to watch his coronation, frankly. It's boring. Forgive me, Xander. Did you kill your brother, Ed? Would you give us a second? No, I did not kill my brother. Well, you didn't seem that sad about his death. Well, maybe I just don't display my emotions to cops. Maybe. Look, I'd like to tell you that Xander and I were the best of friends, but we weren't. We're just different people. We <i>were</i> different people. He'd... always do the right things, say the right things. Dad would say, "jump." He'd ask, "how high?" And you? Dad never asks me to jump. - Mommy! Mommy! - Baby, Hmm? We're going to get ice cream. Okay. One scoop, okay? (Kisses) No spoiling dinner. Okay. (Giggles) One scoop it is. And I'll e-mail you the Arizona overnights. You've got that conference call tomorrow with the affiliates. Okay. Thanks, Elizabeth. Come on. You haven't told her? (Sighs) How do you tell a 6-year-old her father's never coming home? Well, she pretty much knows already. She just doesn't understand it yet. Nor do I. I just... I keep thinking Xander would know exactly what to say to her. It's so stupid, huh? Xander must have had enemies... business rivals that resented his success? Um... sure. Yeah, but nothing abnormal. Well, there is the "Visualize" thing. The "Observer" is about to run an investigative series, and it's gonna be very critical. Visualize? The sort of religious group? You know, it's more like a cult. It's brainwashing with a sideline in tax fraud. You know, we got a-a pretty nasty letter from their leader, Bret Stiles... threatening unspecified trouble if we ran it. I can get you a copy. Oh, you... you had me at "cult." (Indistinct conversations) Creepy. What, you don't ke giant eyeballs? No. Hi. I'm Steven Wench. Most folks call me "Brother Steve." Are you the C.B.I. folks who called? Yeah. Brother Patrick and, uh, my brother Cho. (Steve) Well, come this way. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid Mr. Stiles isn't on the premises today. Where is he? At this precise moment, I don't know. Bret lives spontaneously. But I'm happy to help with any questions. I have a question. Uh, what are they doing in there with those gizmos? That's where our technicians assess for inner vision. - Really? - Mm-hmm. That sounds fun. Can anyone do that? Um... sure. Excellent. Cho, you got the interview, right? Just, uh, sign in. Oh, yeah. Sure, sure. - Hey. I wanna go. - Hi. - Have a seat. - Cool. Excellent. All right. (Imitates buzzer) (Chuckles) Just kidding. W-what do I do? Well, place your fingers on the orb - and, uh, tell me your name. - You first. - David. - Hi, David. I'm Patrick. Fingers on the orb. (Clicking keys) Do you find sadness in the world around you? Yes. Do you find yourself dwelling on the misfortunes of your past? Yeah. Do you often think people are secretly out to get you? Yes. How you doing? - How am I doing? - (Cho) Yeah. Uh, how am I doing? Well, Patrick, you have serious issues with paranoia and depression and negative thinking in general. (Whispers) What? I would recommend our immersive visualization program for you, as a matter of urgency. (Normal voice) Oh, okay. Um... Do-do-do you... do you take that? Ah! Not so fast. You thought you had me, didn't you? You guys have got a sweet scheme going here. Maybe we should get going. We gotta go get a warrant. Before coming to persecute us, did you even look at Xander Harrington's wife? - Sadie. We look at everyone, sir. - What about her? We heard there was trouble in her marriage. If Xander divorced her, there's a prenup. But if he dies, she gets it all. Where'd you hear that, Steve? Do... do you have someone on the inside? I've said enough. Please leave. Do you have a gift shop? - 'Cause I'd love an eyeball mug or something. - No. Okay. (Indistinct conversations) (Man) Good job, Steven. Good job. That was... beautifully handled. Thank you, Mr. Stiles. No, thank <i>you.</i> So the guy claims Stiles is only threatening legal trouble, that Visualize is a religion of science and peace. Tell that to the TV reporter from Atlanta. Last spring, he went off on Visualize, next day, he was flying through the windshield of a member's car. One more thing. About Sadie and Xander's marriage... An affair? No. Xander and I have been partners in everything since the first week of business school. I loved him, and I respected him. I had no reason to stray. Neither did he. Sometimes you don't need a reason. Oh. Agent Lisbon, you're here. Something to report? No, she just, um, thinks I was screwing around on your son. Excuse me. I have better things to do. Do you think she was having an affair? On balance, no. Go on. Sadie loves this company, as well as my son. She'd never risk everything for a roll in the hay. Ambitious as all hell, that girl. I like it. Don't get me wrong. She's doubled our profit since she took over running the TV stations. (Cell phone ringing) Um... (Clicks tongue) Excuse my rudeness. (Beeps) Agent Lisbon. - Get everybody out of the house. - There's not enough time. - Do what you can. - Tara! Sadie! (Cell phone rings) (Groans) (Beep) Hello? It's me. I need your help. Well, hello, Lisbon. You need my help? I need your help finding a bomb. [ Indistinct conversations ] There's still time. You're good at this kind of thing. If we find the bomb intact, maybe we can still get rid of it. What, are you nuts? What do you want to do that for? It's a bomb. Just get out of there. The guy's got comprehensive home insurance, I'm sure. Oh, come on, Jane. We've got two minutes. All right? Where did they put it? They said it was somewhere in the grand salon. Well, if they called it the grand salon, then obviously they're insiders. Good point. Uh, l-leading us where? Uh, let me see. Uh, if I was familiar with that room, I would plant a bomb... Try under the sofa. No, no, no, no, no. (Gasps) The cupboard over by the Dutch forgery - in the corner. - Uh, th-the painting? How do you know it's a forgery? Eh, the brushwork... it's all wrong. It's way too loose. (Whispers) Oh, my God. You were right. Yeah, well, of course. That looser feeling didn't develop until much later on. No! The bomb. I found it. One minute left. Oh, good. Time to leave. Get out of there. Lisbon, if you think I am even gonna engage in this game of "which wire to pull," I'm not interested. I don't wanna play that game. Just leave right now. Run. Okay? Okay. You're right. I'm outta here. Thank you. Good. Where's mommy? - Hang on. - Ashley? - Ashley, we have to leave now. - No! Lisbon! Ashley, get out from under there. Ashley. No! No! I want my mommy! Sweetie, come on. We have to go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on there? - (Strained voice) Ashley, come on. Ashley! (Grunts) Ashley! - No! Leave me alone! I want my mommy! (Grunts) Come out! You come out now! That's an order! - Lisbon, pick up the girl and leave. - (Ashley) I <i>want</i> my mommy! Just pick her up and take her outside. You can do that. Run away now. Lisbon? Ohh... Lisbon! Ohh... (Grunts) Lisbon! (Sighs) You are a very bad girl. (Sighs) You're a bad girl. (Sighs) Agent Lisbon. Thank you. Thank you for saving my granddaughter. We are so grateful. (Chuckles) It's all part of the service. No, you were brave and resourceful, and I'll make sure your supervisors say as much in your file. Look, if there's ever anything I can do for you personally, please don't hesitate. Well, you could offer her the pad for a weekend during the summer. Actually, uh, I was wondering if I could speak with some of your staff who had access to that room. Ah, Edward. Thank you for joining us. I just heard what happened. Is everyone all right? Oh, everyone's fine. It's fine. (Sighs) Well, if there's anything I can do to help, just say the word. I'm here. Actually, uh, I'll be issuing an announcement, and I wanted to let you and Sadie know first. Announcements? Ooh, I love announcements. Um, sh-should we order up a round of cocktails? I'll make this quick. (Sighs) Uh, as much as it pains me to discuss business at a time like this... but the fact is, we do have shareholders, and the board has demanded a new C.E.O. be announced immediately. (Whispers) Sadie, I bet. - Uh... - Sadie. Wow. Uh... Ed, I-I'm sorry. No. No, that's okay. That's... it's your right to name whoever you want. Uh, I-I don't know what to say, Ed. I'm... No, it's okay. It's, um... I get it. I get it. Um, I'm sure you'll do a great job. Congratulations. Okay... Well, I'm not gonna say anything. The bomb threat... we got something. It came from the phone of Elizabeth Stanfeld. Sadie Harrington's assistant. Let's go get that warrant. Nice work. (Chuckles) Thanks. Kitchen's clear. Bedroom, too. Van Pelt been acting weird to you? Please don't talk to me about Van Pelt. No, I won't. Has she? (Taps) No. It's just she's... She's been smiling at me. No kidding. (Chuckles) Sometimes I think she might still be into me. That'd be weird, huh? (Chuckles) You're weird. Cold. You know, I don't think Stanfeld's been here in a while. Hey, check this out. Visualize: A Tool for Living. Elizabeth Stanfeld's a member of Visualize. Looks like Bret Stiles is gonna be talking to us after all. The eye is not just the window to the soul. It is the key to unlocking your greatness. It is the key, because when you see it, you will be it. (Bret) One more time. (Clicks tongue) The eye is not just the window to the soul. It is the key to unlocking your greatness. (Patrick) Excuse me. I'm sorry. Uh... The eye is the key? Or the window? Or is it both? I'm a little confused. Mr. Jane, I presume. - Yeah. - Hello. Welcome. Oh, you're expecting us? Oh, yes. And I presume this is your long-suffering colleague, Agent Lisbon. If I may say, she is more beautiful than advertised. Oh, thanks, guy. Take a little break. Thank you. Give us a few minutes. Thank you. (Clears throat) Thank you. (Clears throat) Elizabeth Stanfeld, your, um... "Dear friend and fine student"... she planted a bomb at the Harringtons' house... a bomb she couldn't have possibly made herself. Lisbon here defused it. Heroine. Oh. Well, I-I'm... I mean, I may have taught her. Uh... Stanfeld? Oh. Uh, w-was she a brunette? - Mr. Stiles, "dear friend"? - Well, yeah, but, you know, I've signed millions of these in my time. I always like to personalize them. It's a little trick I learned from an old friend of mine, Ronnie Reagan. So you have no knowledge of this woman? You have no knowledge of any attacks on the Harrington family? That's your position, is it? No, it's not "my position." (Chuckles) Actually, it's the truth. My eyes aren't, uh... Windows or doors or even keys, for that matter. I use 'em to look at things, and what I'm looking at right now is a big, fat liar. (Chuckles) Really? Really. Yes. Betrayed by a faint facial tremor. You could work on that in the mirror. You'd get some great results. Mm. You know, now I see why... Red John really enjoys sparring with you. A worthy adversary, yeah? Yes. Straight for the jugular. Obviously, you struck a nerve. Hmm. Losing a wife and a child like that... Well, it makes a man reckless, untethered. Fills him with anger and shame that he cannot express. Well, must make <i>your</i> job very hard, hmm? Yes, but the health plan's great. Mm. (Chuckles) Mr. Jane, I think we can help you. I think we can scrub that shame and grief and self-hatred right out of your system. Bret, please. (Laughs) We both know what you are. I mean, let's be honest here. You're a con man. I mean, you're very charming, and you're very good at it, but you're just a con man. And you could no more help me than you can fly to the moon. Mm. <i>Now</i> who's struck a nerve? Nobody's past helping... Even you. Believe me when I say this, Bret... you don't want to make this personal. Now give us Stanfeld, or I will make it my sole purpose to hound you for the rest of your miserable, phony life. (Laughs) Whoa. Am I hearing a threat here? I mean, a-aren't there rules about this sort of thing? Hmm? Like you said, untethered. Mr. Stiles, the percentage play here is to give us Stanfeld. She's not gonna betray you. She's loyal. (Sighs) (Clicks tongue) Forget it, Lisbon. I'm bored. Elizabeth is at Edward Harrington's penthouse. She went to Edward? To do what? I don't know. Uh, she didn't tell me. I gave her no instructions. She went of her own free will. Have a nice day. Rigsby, get to Ed Harrington's place immediately. (Keys jangle, lock clicks) (Whispers) It's clear. (Man exhales deeply and moans) (Normal voice) Police! Don't move! - Let me see your hands! Freeze! - Mr. Harrington? Mr. Harrington, are you... all right? Yep. I think he's... fine. What the hell is going on? (Rigsby) See, the way it looks from here is that you and Elizabeth were in this together. Take out Xander, take out your father, live happily ever after with her and Bret Stiles. No. I'm not into that Visualize crap. If I had any idea, I... uh, she was just... just a friend. (Paper flips) Convenient, though, that she seems intent on taking out everyone between you and the top job at Harrington Media. Was Sadie next? How do you know I wasn't next? Visualize wanted to kill us all because of that idiotic story. Then why didn't she kill you, Ed? - (Edward) I-I don't know. - (Rigsby) You ever meet Bret Stiles? - No. - Anyone at all from the Visualize organization? - No. - So let me get this straight... she was sleeping with you because you were a Harrington, but not an important enough Harrington to kill. Is that it? You're a stooge. Yeah, I'm a stooge. Thanks for the heads-up. So Bret Stiles claims you acted alone. But you had an accomplice, didn't you? An accomplice to what? The bombing attempt. We've got your phone records. Slam dunk. 20 years. 2 decades. 7,000 days living in a box. I don't know how people do it. Now help yourself out here. We know someone gave you that bomb. We know you didn't kill Xander. Sadie Harrington was with you the entire party. Of course I didn't kill him. But you know who did. Give us a name, and we can talk a deal. I'm looking down at you from a great height. You're like ants. It's sad how far I am beyond you people, spiritually and mentally. Mm. But, uh, physically, I think we, uh, we might have the upper hand. And physically is kinda how they roll in prison. Just because you've stopped my work doesn't mean others won't follow in my path. You can't imprison the truth. Oh, Lizzy, you are batnuts crazy. Batnuts, girl. But that's okay. You're young. You <i>can</i> recover your wits. You're gonna have to work very hard, but you've given me a very good idea, and I thank you. Excuse me. We've come to take my son home. - This is a family matter. - I'm sorry, sir, - but we haven't finished questioning him. - Edward made a mistake. It was dangerous, yes, but not criminal, so unless you have some evidence linking him to a crime, - I'd like you to let him go. - Let the poor wretch go, Van Pelt. He's guilty of nothing except extremely poor decision-making, sexual partner-wise, and, uh... Who hasn't been there? Jane. It isn't in my authority to allow that, sir, but if you'll wait a moment, I'll find Agent Lisbon, and she may be able to help you out. - Dad? (Alex) Never mind. There he is. Eddie, we're leaving. You bastard! You stupid son of a bitch! How could you endanger us? Ashley was nearly killed. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go wait in the car. I'm really sorry. You're sorry? Sorry? You little fool. Have you no common sense, boy? - Are you completely... - Sir, you're gonna have to take it easy. Anyhow, here we are. Let's go home and discuss this. (Van Pelt) Mr. Harrington, that isn't going to be possible. (Cell phone rings) (Ring) Oh, hell. Not again. What's wrong? Miserable cowards. More threats! What does it say? "Next time you won't be so lucky." Sent from the same number as the earlier threat. I thought you had traced that call to Stanfeld. Well, they likely use the same number for many different cloned cells. It proves it's the same people, anyhow. Meaning Visualize. Agent Hightower, I'm going to need additional protection for my family, at least until we can get to the house in London. Mr. Harrington, while your family's safety is at stake, maybe it's best to postpone the exposÃ©. If I gave in, where does it stop? My family would be under constant threat from people who don't like what I print or air. We need protection, Agent Hightower. Mr. Harrington, the police assigned to you are very well-trained personnel. We <i>can</i> add more if... I want your best people... Ms. Lisbon and her team. I'll insist on it. Mr. Harrington, that's very flattering, but you... and if you could release my son now, I'd appreciate it. I'll see what we can do. (Police radio chatter, indistinct conversations) (coos) She's about to throw down the queen of spades. Stop showing off. (Sighs) Ha. (Patrick) That's what's called "cutting off your nose to spite your face." (Cell phone rings) - I'll take that. Thank you. - Lisbon. - Good night, everyone. - Good night. Alex, I told Ash she could stay up if you - tucked her in. Is that okay? - Absolutely. Thank you. Night, sweetie. Perimeter's clear, boss. Just checked in with the guards outside. Gin. There you go. Who's next, any takers? (Clicks) Wish me luck. - Double. - Sure. (Clatter) (Patrick) Mm. You're a lucky man. - No such thing as luck. - Really? It's all about knowing the odds, seizing the chances. No luck involved. Hogwash. Hogwash? - You heard me. Hogwash. - What's that? - What? - Shh! (Lisbon) What are you... (Patrick) Shh! Wait a minute. I hear it, too. (Whispers) I got Ashley covered here. - (Whispers) It's coming from in there. - (Whispers) Xander's office? It's been sealed since the murder. (Sighs) (Switch clicks) (Normal voice) Clear. (Normal voice) Wow. Could've sworn I heard someone in here. (Exhales deeply) Oh, what's this? (Chuckles) That's Ashley's. So? That's it. What's it? She was here. She was right here. - What's he talking about? - No idea. That's why she's been so quiet and withdrawn. She witnessed the murder. (Alarm wailing) (Lisbon) The power's been cut. Uh... w-we have a-a backup generator. (Click, electricity hums) (Van Pelt) Perimeter's been breached. - Someone's on the grounds. - Copy that, Van Pelt. Charlie King one, check the grounds. Charlie King one, do you copy? Charlie King one? We're on our way to the safe room. Secure Tara, Sadie and the baby. Go! Come on. - Seal the door now. - Mm. (Lock clicks) (Voice breaks) Grandpa? (Chuckles) It's okay, honey. Don't be scared. We're safe in here. Everything's gonna be all right. Come on. There you go. Oh, I could do with some chocolate. You have any, uh, chocolate, Grace? - No. - Just a little bit? - Van Pelt, what's the status? - Lisbon, that was very good. - I have one question. Who the hell is Charlie King? - Call it up. (Taps keys) (Clicks) I want mommy. Hey, you remember the party we had a few days ago? With all the flowers and music? That's right. You were in daddy's office that afternoon, before the guests got here for the party, remember? Uh, were you maybe... Hiding under his desk? Playing tea party? It's all right if you were. You won't get in trouble. Tell Grandpa the truth, sweetheart. (Sighs) Ashley... If you were there, maybe you saw the game Grandpa was playing with Daddy. Did you? What the hell is going on? Uh, we... it's a very clever plan. Would you like me to explain? Wait. Why are they in the safe room? What are you doing? Ma'am, if you'll come with me, I'll explain everything. 30 seconds and I'm pulling the plug. Daddy's dead, isn't he? It was a game. When your daddy fell... It was an accident. I didn't mean to do it. (Lowered voice) Cho. Put your hands on your head. Now. You're under arrest. (Sighs) You're a bastard! (Slap) Uh, well, thanks for the, uh, feedback. Always appreciated. What's wrong with Grandpa? It's okay, baby. It's okay. (Police radio chatter) You've got nothing. My lawyers will grind this to dust. Don't say a single thing, either of you. They're saying I killed Xan. Well, that's not true, right? Of course not. It was very sweet seeing you with Ashley. Uh, I guess after two sons, when she came along, it lit up your world. Strange, though, that you can't so much as look at your own daughter, nor barely touch your lovely wife. How'd you find out the baby wasn't yours? I know that you believed Tara was having an affair with Xander and that your son was Ella's biological father. And you were partly right. I mean, she was having an affair with your son, but it wasn't with Xander. Was it, Ed? Huh? <i>Oh!</i> Yeah, I figured it out when I saw you two at the CBI. She was very angry with you, very angry. Pure jealousy. Oh, my God. I'm... Ella's father. Congratulations. She's a real peach, actually. She's great. No. Can't be. (Whispers) I am so sorry. No! It was Xander! (Sighs) It was Xander. Okay. We'll take that as a confession. Thank you. Come on. Let's go. You really don't think I can do anything, do you? It can't be. Well, it is. Sorry. You killed the wrong son. (Gasps) (Police radio chatter) Xander and Tara seemed too close. Always whispering together n the corners, breaking apart when I'd come into the room. They were friends. They were probably talking about her affair with Ed. So I ordered a paternity test. The results came back the day of the party. Ella is not my child, but you know that already, don't you? What did you expect, Dad?! You treat her like just another one of your possessions, but she's not! (Alex) I confronted Xan. You betrayed me! He didn't deny it. Why didn't he just deny it? (Patrick) He assumed you knew it was Ed. You! Aah! When I think... of what poor Ashley saw... She didn't see anything. I made it up. But the teacup... she was there. (Whispers) Yes, I know. But it's all in the wrist. (Teacup clatters on table) (Sighs) (Bret) My good friend Senator Aleman is very concerned about my treatment. - Of course, you <i>do</i> know the good Senator, huh? - Yes. - Chair of the Justice Committee. - I know him. Bret Stiles. Good to see you. Looking sharp. (Clears throat) I mean, I'd hate to tell him that you failed to resolve this matter. So why don't we resolve it right now? Mm. Good. Patrick, Mr. Stiles here says that you antagonized him and conducted yourself in a way that reflected poorly on the bureau. Do you have anything to say? Uh, no. I'm...I'm good, thanks. Okay. Actually, there's one thing I'd like to say. - Is this gonna be helpful, Patrick? - Probably not. Okay, then, there you go. Nice talking with you. What? You're... you're kidding, right? That's it? No. Do give my best to Senator Aleman. Is he still seeing that stripper in Bakersfield? Lovely girl. Well, well. (Chuckles) (Sniffs) I can see that I've met my match here. You two... quite the double act. Ah. I will retreat, chastened. By the way... We will find a way to charge you with that attempted bombing. Miss Hightower, shh. Don't push your luck. So long, Bret. Don't draw the wrong lesson here, Patrick. I've got Stiles checkmated. But if a player with real juice came in here, I'd want to see you dance for him. Isn't that what we just did? You know what I mean. Okay.
