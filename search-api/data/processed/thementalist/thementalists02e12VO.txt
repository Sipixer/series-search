Would you tell us why and how a psychic becomes a CBI agent? I'm not a psychic. No such things as psychics. And he's not a CBI agent. He's a consultant. Big difference. "No such thing as psychics." Care to elaborate? No, not particularly. This is not a good idea. It's not a good idea. Maybe we'll come back to that later. How do your cases usually start? A case begins with us getting a phone call from the AG's office to lead an investigation. In the St. Clare homicide, the local DA wanted us on it because there were political issues involved. And how did the local cops feel about your team coming in? We get along extremely well with our local partners in law enforcement. My people can handle this, no problem. California Bureau of Interference is what you are. - Interference? That's witty. - Stay out of this. I'm sure you're competent, Chief Donner. We're following the AG's orders. Screw the AG. This case is going to be in the news, and you're spotlight hogs. That's all. - I assure you... - Don't waste your time. His anger runs deeper than you can reach. Don't start trouble here. It's the last thing we need. The victim is Martha St. Clare, 34. Media relations coordinator for the mayor. Mayor was here to break ground dug up her PR flack instead. Victim was stabbed in the chest, but there's no blood. - Killed elsewhere. - Home. Her nails and hair's are done. She doesn't wear sweatpants anywhere but at home. Have Van Pelt check it out. The killer wanted the body to be discovered here under the glare of the cameras. And likely came here to watch the fuss. Likely. Maybe the camera crews caught something. We'll need to have them look into it. There's bruises on her arms. Looks like something was ripped off her neck. Is he sniffing her? You pay him to sniff people? Apparently. She's been smoking. The patch on her arm says she was trying to quit. - So under stress of late. - Well, case closed. Stress got a knife and stabbed her. He's on a roll. You're on a roll. Cheap soap. Unironed shirt. Stomach pains. Recent loss of weight. I'm gonna take a wild guess here. You're not well. 'cause you're living in a motel 'cause your wife knows about your affair with that you don't even care for. You're a seething mass of self-loathing and understandably so. - You son of a bitch! - Chief Donner, my apologies. He was completely out of line. Let's just get back to the body, sir? We've closed more cases than any other unit in the CBI. But we don't keep score that way. It's not a contest. And you also lead in the number of complaints and lawsuits filed. Hold it. I thought we had an agreement. Brenda, a word. Jane's right. This isn't a good idea. This was supposed to be positive coverage. It is! It will be. If we're open and honest, the positivity follows. That's PR 101. We're trying to solve a woman's murder here, Brenda. We don't have time to waste on PR. We have been crucified by the media ever since Bosco was killed here. When KTQZ asked me for access, I jumped at it, and the deputy AG concurred. Who is this guy anyway? Totally legit TV investigative reporter. Mike Brewster. He has been covering the central valley for years. We need this, Teresa. Please. - Work with us. - He stays out of my way. He can film here, but not out in the field. Thank you. Seriously, thank you. You won't be sorry. And it's a two-way street. If there's anything I can do... There is one thing. This is the footage we grabbed of the groundbreaking. That's the Mayor. Melba Walker Shannon. She plays up the folksy image, but she can be tough as nails. Nice shoes. - Chip? - No, thanks. - Who's the rich guy next to the mayor? - Heaton Krupp. The private developer. Off the record, a prize jerk. Who are those people? Tree huggers. The project's going up on the edge - of some reclaimed land. - Means protected wildlands. You say "potato." You have any other footage of the crowds? Other networks might, but gaining access can be tricky. It'd be good to get a different perspective. - See if you can get the footage. - You got it. That's Wilson Fonteneau, the mayor's flunky, and here comes the money shot. These are from the victim's home. The only thing that seemed to be missing was the victim's laptop. - The murderer probably took it. - Check out this necklace. It looks like she wore it a lot. It could have made the mark on her neck? Could be. When you go to the apartment, do a targeted search. The necklace is long gone. My guess, the killer made a souvenir of it. Go. - Where we going? - Mayor's office. I don't have any problem being in charge, no. Maybe at first for a while, as a woman, it was a challenge, but the demands of the job take over. Tell me about your weekends. You want to know what I do on my weekends? Why do you want to know that? I have no problem having a life, if that's what you mean. I don't know why anybody would say otherwise. If they do say otherwise. I'm sorry. What were we talking about? Sorry for the delay. The mayor's was in a meeting. It's been a crazy day. - Can I help you? - No, I'm fine. Thanks. Mr. Fonteneau did you work closely with Martha St. Clare? For 16 months. Martha hired me, actually. We noticed in a lot of recent photographs that she had a necklace on with a beautiful stone. Yes, a topaz, I think It was her birthstone. She got it on Christmas and never took it off. Do you know who gave it to her? She had a lot of meetings, even on weekends. Business interests, community groups, book club. Tomorrow is a big day. She has a star and 3 exclamation marks at 11:00. She scheduled a briefing with the city council. On what subject? I don't know, to be honest. The mayor will know. Was she dating anyone? A social life, Martha? No, she had a cat. But it died. Right. Excuse me. Are you the CBI Agents? - Thank you for seeing us. - Happy to help, call me Melba. Like the toast? Just like. This way. Can you tell us about your construction project? It's the Granton Complex, yes. We are very proud of it. It's office and retail space plus housing all built with the latest green technology. And what was Martha's involvement? None, really. She... She was my media liaison. She was not engaged in policy issues. Then what was she gonna talk about at city council tomorrow? A press junket. It was river rafting, I believe. Chief Donner says your office has received threats from environmental activists. Activists? No, they're terrorists. They burned down vacation condos. They destroyed luxury car lots just one town over. They're led by a madman, and he calls himself Jasper. Excuse me. Wilson, anything else can wait. - The threats? - Yes. The Granton development is an abomination.</i> A hundred acres of pristine wildlands razed,</i> An entire ecosystem endangered. It must stop.</i> It will stop, no matter what needs to be done.</i> My name is Jasper, and I am legion. Come on. "I am legion." That's just silly. Silly? - He murdered Martha. - You assume. Yes, I do. The body was buried at the site, for God's sake. That is a clear message, isn't it? Melba, why would he kill Martha and not kill you? It'd be a bigger publicity coup. Excuse me? What Mr. Jane is trying to ask is whether there was somebody with a personal grudge against Martha. She was a lovely... was a lovely person. Why did you dislike her so much? I didn't dislike Martha. Why would I employ someone that I don't like? Good question. When you said it, your jaw tensed and your eyes went empty like a cobra. - Wilson! - I'm not saying you killed her. But that you're relieved that she's dead. - These people will be leaving. - I like the way you say that, Melba-like-the-toast, so tough and commanding. Now, listen. We are state law enforcement, and we leave when we want. - Thank you, ma'am. - She wants to leave. See yah. You blew my cool. I swear, sometimes you need medication. Like you've got ADD or something. A, I'm not so sure that ADD even exists,</i> and B, I was winding her up for a reason.</i> - Which is? - A diversion. The message the aide brought in made her nervous. - You're stealing now? - Let's just call it purloining. - What does it say? - It says "your 3:00 meeting has now been moved to 3:15." I'm just kidding. It says, "9-1-1. Call now. "Urgent. About Martha." From Heaton Krupp. The developer of the Granton project. Do you enjoy police work? Patrick? Yeah, I'm thinking. Yes and no. Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes not. Forget it, Steve. Why do you so dislike being filmed? 'Cause you're stealing my soul. So I called the mayor. So what? I'm building a $20 million complex in her town. - I call her a lot. - About ms. St. Clare? About when I can start construction again. This is costing me a lot of dollars. It cost Ms. St. Clare a lot more. I'm sorry about that. I am. There's nothing I can do. - Martha would've wanted us to go on. - You knew her well to know that? You're right. I'm being pious. Maybe Martha would've said, screw it. I knew her not very well. Really? We got her cell phone records, and you called her several times. What you wanted to talk about so urgently? Seems I should get my lawyer. Sure. Tell him to bring all your permits. - Why? - Why not? Make sure this stays on crime scene. Keep everyone out. - Could take weeks. - See... We were talking about money. $10 million in public funds was to be released when we broke ground. Then I heard rumors that St. Clare was planning to tell the city council to withhold them. - Why? - I don't know! I was trying to find out. But St. Clare was killed before she could talk. The $10 million will come to you after all. Are you trying to lay this on me? Because you're messing with the wrong guy! - Not officers, Agents. - That's quite a temper. Look out! Get down, get down! Get on the floor! Help! I got the door! Go! I got the door! I got you. This was done by someone who knew what he or she was doing. Crackpot Jasper. He's a terrorist, And you ain't doing jack to catch him, chief. I'm in charge of the town of Salter, Mr. Krupp, not the outlying areas. Jasper's never launched an attack here in town before. - Until now. - Check this out. Apparently, this is the same tag that Jasper used. - It's good just here? - That's great. I've been in fires before. I worked with the, Arson squad in San Diego for a couple years, I'm not unfamiliar with the issues. It's never pleasant, though. When you're in it, it's there's no time to think. But afterwards, well... It can make you think. There was a... There was a moment there where, Yeah, makes you think. It's a gift, isn't it? Life. You should be grateful for it... Make the most of it. Let's catch this guy before he kills again. He hasn't killed anyone yet. Not Martha St. Clare? She was about to stall the development. That what Jasper wants. So why kill her? Maybe he didn't know Martha's intentions. But the mayor must have known. Let's go see her. You guys look into this Jasper character. Don't bother. He's a red herring. What does that mean? A red herring is what you look in to regardless of what Jane tells you. Anything on the videos? They've been throwing up hurdles. About first amendment issues. Get the footage. I'm tired of their excuses. We ID somebody in the crowd,. Yes, boss. Why am I a detective? Why are you a reporter? - What? - Why are you making this documentary? - It's a fresh perspective on police. - No, what's in it for you? Scoring this exclusive is a good way to get noticed. So you're ambitious. How long you do this job? - About eight years. - Anchor? Mostly fieldwork. So you're ambitious, but you haven't gotten very far. I guess that's about it. You don't like being asked questions? The team as a whole seems to have a problem with that. - Is that a question? - Mike, - if I can interrupt here? - Yeah. - We're clear. - There's coffee in the kitchen. I'm so sorry. - Agent Cho? - Yeah? It is the specific request of the deputy A.G. that your unit cooperate fully with the media. What's your point? Mayor Shannon, we need to talk. I have a meeting. Please make it fast. How big was your bribe from Heaton Krupp? That is an outrageous slander. You sold your approval of the Granton project. Martha found out. She was gonna reveal it At the city council meeting, which you said was gonna be about river rafting. River rafting from where did you pull that? You better have really good personal lawyers. If you pursue this absurd line of harassment, I will hang you by your heels. Did you get a slice, too, or are you strictly wage labor? Your superiors will hear from our lawyers. Don't bother with lawyers. It's such a waste of taxpayer dollars. - Confess. You'll feel a lot better. - In actuality, you have no proof - of this so-called bribery. - None at all. Are all CBI Agents this incompetent? Have you even bothered to check her lover as a suspect? You say it was Jasper. Now it's the lover. You gonna make up your mind? What lover? We understood she had no social life. I didn't know she did. She did and competent police would have known that. Why didn't you tell us this earlier? Why don't I just do your job for you? How would that be? - Just please arrest her or something. - Nothing to hold her on. I'm the rookie on the team. Been here... 18 months now. It's hard work, but... this has been my dream ever since I was a kid. to be a Detective. And what's been the most surprising thing you've learned about this job you do? I've... learned a lot about myself... As well as about other people... stuff I wish I didn't know sometimes. Stuff like... Why people do bad things to one another. It's mainly because of secrets. Trying to hide the truth chips away at your spirit. Secrets... ruin relationships. We got the footage from every news station covering the groundbreaking ceremony. Apparently, threats work. These are 2 separate vantage points of the mayor, and these are feeds of the crowd. There... that guy. Can you narrow it down for us? There's 50 guys there. The guy in the crowd there. After the mayor digs up the victim. He certainly doesn't look like he fits in. That's bold. - A Jasper acolyte. - Or the man himself. Get with the local P.D. See if they can identify him. - What is it? - Nothing. Just hungry. We went back to St. Clare's apartment, in her closet, we saw that some of her work shirts, - button on the right. - Yeah, and not her size. So the mayor was right. She did have a lover. Of course. That necklace she wore was obviously a romantic gift. She'd never spend so much money on herself. Now you say so. Very wise in hindsight. It went without saying. It's so obvious when people are in a relationship. Impossible to hide, try though they might. She was a very attractive woman. I would not be surprised if she had two lovers. There is nothing here. I'm gonna go out for lunch. Turn that thing off, or I will shove it down your throat. Let's take a walk, shall we? Come on. I know it hasn't been the most pleasant experience having a camera crew here. But you gotta cooperate-- deputy A.G.'s orders. So what's the deal? I would think out of everybody, you'd be the most comfortable with the cameras. Last time I was in front of a camera, things didn't turn out so well. God, Jane, I'm sorry. You don't need to be sorry... and you're right. There's no reason not to be civil. I'm going to apologize. I'm sorry. We didn't mean to be intrusive. I shouldn't have snapped at you. I'm sorry. I just... I don't like feeling spied on. It's my own little neurosis. - You're just doing your job, right? - Right. Let me buy you a taco. - Sure. - I know you're in. - I am kind of hungry. - That's the spirit. I know the perfect place. Vamonos. Muchas gracias. - Mike. - Thank you. Steve. So tell me about news gathering. Did you get that? Keep moving. Let's go. I don't know where we're going, but I hope there's a bathroom. I am busting. Definitely Jasper. The description of the van matches one seen near the condo fire and the luxury car lot Jasper destroyed. How long has Chief Donner had this information? - Contact the local and the county P.D. - On it. We got a hit on the Jasper associate at the ceremony. Activists draw the line at kidnapping. They gave this guy up fast. Bart Henrik. On his blog, he calls himself a green warrior. He's been arrested several times for inciting a riot, public disorder and vandalism. - Go find him. Take Rigsby. - You got it. I can see you mean business. There's no need for firearms. I'm not Harry Houdini. Quiet. Thank you. So you're Jasper. Well, I'm honored. Please don't say you kidnapped me for ransom, because I doubt you'll get $50, - let alone save the whales. - No ransom. In actuality, just a simple message... I did not kill Martha St. Clare And I didn't throw that firebomb in Krupp's office. And you... you are gonna tell that to the police and to the media. So you kidnapped me to proclaim your innocence. Have you ever heard of a phone? I see. If you kidnap me, and I pass on the message, then you get a blast of that publicity that you love. If I am branded a killer, everything I have fought for is discredited. People support me because I have respect for all living things. Yes. But it's a good rule of thumb to avoid doing things that require you to wear a mask. And you're such a handsome fellow, too. How'd you know I'm handsome? - I was just speaking figuratively. - No, you weren't. - You know who I am. - No, I have no idea. - Leave us and don't come back. - He doesn't have to go anywhere. Will you listen to me? I have no idea... You could be Elvis Presley. - How did you know? - I don't know. How did you... Please don't do that. How did you know? What's not to know? Your height, your body language, Your syntax. You said "in actuality." Who says "in actuality"? Very clever. So now we have a problem. Get that thing out of my face! Jasper hold our colleague. Where are they? Jasper who? Did you know you can get more time for kidnapping than murder? That's crazy. Being an accessory after the fact makes you just as guilty as Jasper. Jasper's avenging mother earth. That's all. You know him well to be sure of his motives. So well you can tell us where he is. Even if I knew, which I don't, I would never betray Jasper. - "Never" is a big word. - Try me. What would Jane want us to do in this situation, Cho? - With his life in jeopardy. - You know what he'd want us to do. I guess we have to go... There. Let's call an ambulance. Sure. They can set it fast, and we can get back to questioning. Wait, set what? Your arm, you broke it, slipped on the stairs. You should be more careful, Henrik. A bunch of people saw me come in here fine. A bunch of cops, and I'm one of them. I saw you fall. And every cop in this building will say exactly the same. A cabin in the Sierra Foothills, 10 miles northeast of Salter. Nice work. What to do? What to do? If I let you go now, you'll rat me out. - If I may make a suggestion? - No, you may not. Please, Wilson, I can help. I cannot go to prison. I need to finish my work. Don't you see? I do. I see. Your work is very important. But what I don't understand, though, is why you were working in the mayor's office. Where better to study the enemy than from within their very camp? Did you know that the mayor was taking bribes from Krupp? Of course. Who do you think put Martha onto it? You told her. But why not expose the mayor yourself or do it as Jasper? They would know that Jasper was inside the mayor's office. They would soon suspect me. I work in the shadows. That's why I am still here, - still fighting. - I understand. Let me help you. Don't try to play me. Don't go saying you won't tell on me if I set you free, I know you will. Wilson, I am not trying to play you. I will not play you. I understand and respect your intelligence. Have a seat. Just take a moment. Wilson, look at me. I can help you. How? Look at me. You can see that I'm telling the truth. I want what you want, peace and harmony. Peace... Quiet... It's easy. You can have it. If you want it, you can have it. So peaceful. This is Chief Donner of the Salter Police Department!</i> You're surrounded. Stay cool. Just stay cool. - Clear! - Clear! There's a trapdoor. - I got him. - Lisbon? - Jane. - I'm impressed. How did you find me out here? Right, because we're lost without you? I wouldn't say that, but I'm still impressed. Wait, don't move. They could have booby-trapped the place. The bomb squad is to take a look at you. You're kidding. I'm thankful and all that, but get me out of here, I'll tell you the story. What story? So we know who Jasper is. No trace of him. Slipped right through the locals' hands. He knows those woods a lot better. Jane, enough recovery time. Tell us what Fonteneau said. He spouted a lot of nonsense, denial. He took the job in the mayor's office to plan targeted attacks on new developments around town. He and St. Clare became lovers. Secret boyfriend. But when St. Clare found out about Fonteneau's secret life as Jasper, he killed her for it, to keep her quiet. I'll check on the warrant for Fonteneau's place. Get everybody briefed, suited up and ready to roll. Look for St. Clare's necklace. It was a gift from Fonteneau. My guess, he took it when he killed her. We need it. You guys sit on the location until the warrant comes in. - Chief Donner? It's Lisbon. - I need some aspirin. I just wanted... Could you hold on, chief? That's enough. We're done filming. Catching the bad guy would be a great end of the show, make you guys look like superstars. It'd certainly make the deputy A.G. very happy. True. All right. You can film the bust, but you have to do exactly what I say. - Deal. - Meet me at Fonteneau's at 0600 hours. We're gonna need assistance from your entry team again. What now? We set a perimeter and wait for the warrant. There's a lot of this kind of stuff. Not too many car chases. Maybe we could, ask a few questions? Sure. If you must. How did you come to work with the CBI? You know how. I need you to say it to the camera. I see. I got it. I came to work with the CBI after my wife and child were murdered. Have you ever experienced loss like that? A loss of love? There's nothing more important than love, is there? We're talking about you. It can be very hard when love goes away. It's like a... A betrayal, Almost like a violent act, right? Right? I guess. Why don't we go back to... When you give someone your heart and they throw it aside, It's natural to be angry. Especially when you've come to rely on them, When your career is tied to theirs. - I don't know what... - Show us what you got in your pockets. - What? - You heard me. Why not? - Because you don't have the right. - Okay. I tell you what you have in your pocket, And you tell me if I'm right. You have a blue topaz necklace that you once gave to Martha Martha St Clare when you were lovers. You took that necklace back after you killed her. You were gonna plant it in Fonteneau's house, prompted by my cunningly brilliant ruse. That's it. - I don't know how that got in there. - Please. Don't be so silly. Arrest him, Cho. Get on your knees. Put your hands on your head. Now! Get up. That's for you. And this... Is for me. Here it comes. - There. - You looked away. Martha body hasn't been revealed, and you looked away, you knew what was gonna happen, because you buried that body at that building site and you firebombed the trailer to try and frame Jasper. You're too clever, Mike, you're just too clever. You spout a lot of theory, but no legal proof. You want legal proof? The lab reports came back. They found traces of Martha's blood in the trunk of your car. Do you want to tell us what happened? Rumors said the mayor was dirty, But there was no proof. I knew something was up. But... no matter how much I pushed her, Martha wouldn't say anything. Nothing. And last night... I was going through her computer, checking on some stuff, you know? I found this speech she was preparing to give,</i> exposing the mayor as corrupt, With proof... Facts and figures, the whole deal. And she kept it from me the whole time.</i> This is a story that could have made my career. I have been waiting for a story like this my whole life. And she's mad 'cause I'm on her computer. Hello. So she... She said, she couldn't trust me anymore and that it was over. The argument escalated, and, I took my necklace back. And then she starts taunting me Implying that I don't have what it takes to be in the big leagues anyway,</i> saying I'm a loser. She's had enough? She's had enough? She has? I've had enough. Me! We'll take that as a confession. In a stunning revelation, mayor Melba Walker Shannon</i> has been arrested by the D.A. for corruption charges...</i> Stemming from the Granton at Salter development.</i> The accuser is her closest aide, Wilson Fonteneau,</i> who agreed to testify against the mayor in exchange for leniency regarding his activities</i> as eco-terrorist "Jasper." This only the latest development in a bizarre story</i> of murder and greed that has captivated the Central Valley.</i> I was enjoying that. I hate how they overdramatize everything. - Yeah, I hate that. - "Captured the Central Valley." Give me a break. Doughnuts. - Thanks. - Ladies first. So, guys? I have something to say. We have something to say. Life's too short for dishonesty Van Pelt... Grace and I are... Lovers. No, you're not. - Yes, we are. - No, you are not lovers. But we are, though. No, you're not, because a sexual relationship between two fellow bureau employees is strictly against the rules. Which is why we kept it a secret. But we don't want to live a lie anymore. Come what may. - It's a big secret. Well-kept. - You knew, but nobody else did. - I knew. Half the building knows. - They do not. The only person that didn't know is glaring at you right now. And now I have to do something about it.
