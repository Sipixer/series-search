- Three. Front, back, basement. Windows are all boarded up. Witnesses said 3 men took part in the abduction. So figure those 3 inside plus a couple more just for fun. It's Mia Westlake. I want everybody - to take another good long look. - It's her. We believe the kidnapper's got her alive, be careful. Me, Hicks and Martinez take the front door. Dyson and Shelly, take the two-three corner. Bucci, Paulson and Fredericks, take the three-four. Go. - Ready. - Ready. Three, two, one. Stay where you are! FBI! - What are you doing here? - What do you think? What are you doing here? You waving your guns around. Can you put your guns away. Cowboys! 2x07 "Red Bulls" The important thing is nobody got hurt. All respect to your people, the important thing is... We make sure that this does not happen again. CBI agents shoot each other. Is not a headline that I want to see. We came in hot because we thought the kidnap victim was there. - Mia somebody. - Mia Westlake. Marin county heiress. She was taken a day and a half ago. Witness gave us a partial plate on the kidnapper's car. We dug up an outstanding parking ticket... to a car in Oakland, checked the address, There were people in a house that was supposed to be empty. He found you there because? We got a call from the coroner's bureau. There was a report of a corpse in a house. They were shorthanded budget cuts so they asked us to check it out. My team went there. The corpse was there - but not the coroner, so we waited. - And everyone almost died. - Where are you with Westlake? - Set up inside the house. Waiting for a ransom demand. - What's with the corpse? - Young male dead three to five years. Coroner couldn't be specific. There 2 bullet holes in the base of the skull. It was wrapped in plastic and stored in a window seat. - Do you have an ID? - Not yet. Yes yet. Coroner's report just came in, the corpse is... Colin Haymer. I know that name? Colin Haymer was a kidnap victim three years ago. Early 20s from San Francisco, wealthy family. S.F.P.D. handled the case. Family paid the ransom. Didn't work. Eerily similar to your kidnapping, no? Who wants to bet C. Haymer kidnapper the same that kidnapped Mia Westlake? - Well, could be a coincidence. - There are no coincidences. I agree. I want your people teaming up on this. - That necessary? - Yes it is. I want to foster better inter-unit relations. Let's stop stumbling into each other and try working together. You have concerns. I do. This man... I don't even know what he is. An accident waiting to happen. - Be fair. - He closes cases, i know. - I do. - He does. In my opinion, this is a mistake. Okay. Off you go. Mia Westlake was abducted 38 hours ago, coming home from a gallery opening. - Thank you, Rebecca. - You need anything else? We're good. Thank you. This is copies of the case paperwork so far. Now the kidnappers forced her car off the road, killed the driver and then took her. Why kill the driver? It's a message. They'll kill the hostage if they don't get what they want. No ransom demand. Is it really a kidnapping? They sent the family a proof of life a few hours later. No blindfold, that's not good. They don't care if she sees anything. - Good thinking, Bert. - What's your problem? No problem. I agree. This is shaping up to end like the Haymer abduction. Let's make sure that it doesn't. - I get back to the Westlakes. - I'd like to come with. I'd like to ask some questions about our dead guy, see if there's connections. Digging on the Haymer case. - Contact the family, set up interviews. - I'd like leave Hicks with you. That's all right with you? - Keep 'em honest. - What did he say? Care to reframe that? They're Jane's people. They need watching. I like to think of them as my people. Think what you like. I can't have them trying to pull some cheap stunt behind my back. We've a whole range of expensive stunts if you prefer. I understand your issue, agent Bosco. No problem. Welcome, Hicks. We'll extend every courtesy. Let's go. Let's get started. Verona Westlake. - This is Mia's sister. - You must be CBI, too? I'm agent Lisbon. That's Patrick Jane. My husband Duncan Weaver. More CBI? Where did you come from, anyway? - I never heard of you. - You neither. Nice place, you must be loaded. How did you make the money? My grandfather, actually. Oil, lumber. I just assumed it was new money, because of the... the decor. Already you start with this crap? What? Belinda Sandborne, Verona's attorney. Any conversation you have with Verona or Duncan, I need to be there. Not a problem. Is there someone else we should be talking to? I'm sort of... the family. Our parents are dead. Mia, she's the grown-up, capable one. I'm the mess. Too bad, huh? - They took the wrong sister. - You're doing fine. Listen to the man with the gun, babe. We understand you're investigating a related case? Another kidnapping that may have been carried out by the same people. How did it, turn out? Did the person they took get home okay? No. He was killed. His name is Colin Haymer. Here's his picture. He's from Pacific Heights. Does he look familiar? You, babe? Nothing. Sorry. Does his name ever come up in any context, even casually? I don't think so. He was working at a company called Straf Investments when he was taken. - Anything to do with them? - Straf? No, i don't think so. I'll check the records. I'm sorry i'm not really helping. I'm trying. I'm not... Hello! Look what i found. What are you doing in here? She's yours? - Mrs. Kent? Where is she? - Mrs. Kent! She's fine. She's a little smelly, but, other than that, she's a little cherub. - Sorry. - Mrs Kent, please keep her in her room. We discussed this. Yes, ma'am. Boss, ransom demand just came in. Excuse me. How the message came in? It's a video attachment to an e-mail. - Can you get the IP address? - I'm trying, but they routed it through a bunch of servers. It might take days. You want me to read this? My name is Mia Westlake. I am not hurt. I am being treated well. For my safe return, you must pay $3.75 million in small, nonsequential bills. This money is to be ready by 6:00 pm tonight.</i> You will be instructed what to do then.</i> Failure to comply will result... in my immediate execution. Any interference will result in my immediate execution.</i> Verona, if you're watching this... Did you see the tat on that guy? That looks like mexican mafia. We're not gonna get anything out of the Westlakes now. - Let's go. - $3.75 million. Very specific number, don't you think? Maybe the kidnappers watch the Westlakes' bank account. I'll talk to Bosco about it, then we'll go. Okay. Take your time. Excuse me. We'd like some privacy. I can understand that. What's in your pocket? None of your business. You just keep tapping it... tap, tap, tapping it. Whatever is in there, you're obviously nervous about it. I'm assuming it's illegal. My best guess would be... drugs. Do you have any lemon? I'm gonna go find your boss, Be sure to tell her about the drugs in your pocket. I'll be right here with your lovely wife. Please leave. I just want to be alone. That's what we all want. No one gets it. So there's no lemons? - No, i don't think so! - I really felt like... Never mind. Your sister needs you here now. As comforting as it might be to crawl under the blanket of narcotics that your husband has so generously procured for you, it's better that you don't. Nothing i do is going to help her. Probably. What's the point? What you can accomplish is irrelevant. But if you are absent in this moment, you'll regret it for the rest of what will be a miserable life. That's all. See you. What were you doing there? Just getting a snack, a little light refreshment. Why don't I believe you? What is this? This is proof of my veracity. - Time to go. - I'm gonna stay. I know what this is about. Bosco's got the Red John file. You think if you hang long enough, you'll weasel your way into it. - Weasel is too strong. - You're wasting your time. Bosco will never go for it. - Never. - What? - I'll never go for what? - I like the way you work. I want to work on your team on the kidnapping detail. You do? A live kidnapping victim is so much more my speed than a shriveled corpse. Like I care about your speed. You claim to have control over this whack-job. - Do me a favor and walk him away. - Don't talk to me that way. - You rude. - Quiet. Minelli gave us specific orders. I don't give a flying. - You this agent's boss? - Why? I want him removed from this case. Now, all right? He's disrespectful, rude and unprofessional. He's just angry 'cause I called him on his drug deal thing. Okay, you're nuts. Ihave no drugs. Liar. I demand you take him off the case, or there will be consequences. Sir, that's not your call. You think? One phone call, I can have you directing traffic. - Is that right? - Yeah, it is. Well, make your call, 'cause he staying on the case whether you like it or not. Really? Yes. You see this? You see what he's done to my wife? This guy's out of control. Shut up, Duncan. - I was trying to explain... - Shut up. Mr. Jane, is it? What you said earlier was right. I guess. Leave him alone. Okay then, it's settled. Have fun. Wait. S.F.P.D. sent over transcripts of the interviews from the Haymer case. You want names that begin with "A" through "L" or "M" through "Z"? - "A" through "l." - You got it. - Rather "M" through "Z." - Too late. You already chose. Come on. Rock, paper, scissors? Step up. Bert, can I get on this rock, paper, scissors? I haven't had a really good game since I was, 10. It's Rigsby. I know. Why he called me Bert? I'm sure I don't know. It's Bert, like the muppet. It's a stupid nickname. It mean anything. Bosco's team calls us Bert and Ernie. - You knew that? - It would bother you. - It doesn't bother you? - Ernie's the clever handsome one. - Where's Jane? - With Bosco. Don't ask me why, 'cause I don't know and I don't care. What do you got? I've been checking out the house where we found Haymer's body. It's been abandoned seven years. There were some complaints about squatters five, six years ago. Nothing else. There's a Louis Earlen to see you in your office. - Keep digging. - Right. Lieutenant Earlen. - Thanks for coming. - Louis, please. I'm retired. So you found poor Colin Haymer? We did. You were in charge of the kidnapping investigation, - right? - I was. Spent a lot of time with the Haymer family. - Have they been notified? - They have. Hope it's some kind of consolation. They've been waiting a long time. We have another kidnapping. Maybe the same people are involve. How can I help? Anybody we should take a look at? Tall order. We looked at a lot of people. We were wondering if maybe it was an inside job. The ransom demand was pretty specific. We considered that. I always had a feeling about Colin's girlfriend. - It's just a feeling. - Remember her name? Diane Zar... Zaranski. Talked to her twice. When's the ransom drop? Tonight, 6:00. The night Colin's ransom got paid, I sat with his parents till morning. Just waitin' to hear, he was safe. Don't think we said ten words. If it is the same people that took Colin, you do this girl's family a favor. Money drops at 6:00. You tell them their child is dead, give 'em a chance to get used to it. It would be a kindness. - I might have something. - What? Those squatters in the house where we found Haymer. Drug dealers. Oakland narcotics said they're an extended family, 8 or 10 people. They grew pot on a farm called Crazy Hill in Goodhue county,</i> brought it into Oakland and sold it out of the house. And this has to do with Haymer how? Apparently, they also sold drugs that they bought from border cartels, and they picked up some of the cartels' habits like kidnapping for cash. So they went from dealing pot to kidnapping wealthy kids? - Less effort, more profit. - Do you have any names? Known as the Crazy Hill Gang. One of the them was nicknamed "Deezer." Nobody knows his real name. Deezer's been hanging around an apartment in west Oakland. Let's check the building out. Forgot my extra mags. Meet you downstairs. "Extra mags." Big man. - Where's your vest? - Don't need one. - Sure you do. - We're just canvassing. For people called the "Crazy Hill Gang." You should wear a vest. Look, it's hot. It's uncomfortable. Hicks isn't wearing one. You're afraid he'll make fun of you? Not at all. Don't be an idiot. Put on a vest. Fine, get shot. See if I care. There you go. - One more? - She likes you. She has good taste. - You're good with children. - Unlike your employers? What? Come on. It's clear to see they're skittish about the parenting. I wouldn't know anything. Verona's low self-esteem makes her doubt she'll ever be a real parent. And because Duncan married her for her money. He sees the child as a rival, in more than the usual Freudian term. They're very caring people. Very loving, just not particularly hands-on, if you know what i mean. How's Duncan's relationship with Mia? It can be hard. It makes sense. If he sees his child as a rival, why not his sister-in-law? I've heard angry words between them. I think Mia doesn't trust him. But... i shouldn't say anything. But you did. We got to go. All right. Gotta go and run an errand with the big, serious man. Come on. Let's go. Bye. So what's the deal here? The tattoo on the kidnapper's arm suggests The mexican mafia might be involved. Those guys. They're members. So we're gonna go talk to 'em. They look scary. They are scary. You've become a full member until you've killed. Maybe I'll just wait here. No, you're coming with me. I need you for backup. Backup? Hey, fellas. Hola. ¿Qúe pasó? I'm agent, Bosco with the CBI. - Agent Jane. - Hi. I was wondering if any of you fellas have seen your man Snoopy? We need to talk to him. Snoopy? Snoop. We're lookin' for him. Ke'd like to talk to him. Keep walkin'. Who are you? Why are you being that way? I asked you nicely. - Iasked... - The name is Raoul, and i ain't got no warrants, - So back up, fool. - Well Raoul, We are gonna have to go have a private chat in a moment. I ain't did nothing wrong. Don't make it difficult. Tuugh guys, huh? Depends on what you mean by "tough." Emotionally resilient? So now you gonna play me, too? That's battery on a state officer. - Now i'm gonna have to take you in. - Barely touched him, homes! We're gonna go have a conversation about respect. And you? Come on. Anybody else? - You? You? - All right. I'm waiting. Move! That's right, move. That's right. Thank you. How long have you been an informant for the CBI, Raoul? What are you talking about? What informant? Come on. You can come clean with me. Who is this guy, Sam? What did you tell him? What's going on? - Guess he just figured it out. - It's kind of obvious. As if you'd want me for backup. Really. Listen, You know about the Westlake kidnapping. Is Emme involved?</i> I ain't heard anything about that. Westlake? - You sure? - Sure, no, but when a big score's coming up, I hear about it. People start bragging even before they got the money. I ain't heard nothing about that. We saw Emme - tats on the kidnappers. - Come on. Anybody can get a tattoo. They were kind of showy. A little too visible, don't you think? Like it was meant to misdirect us. That kind of stuff is getting to be a real problem. People putting their crimes on la Emme.</i> You jacked me up for nothing. Thanks a lot. We really appreciate it. Come on, get in. Only now you gotta punch me in the face. - May be people watching. - They're watching. - Come on. - Serious. Next time, make sure it's for a worthwhile question. That was good, did that hurt? Looks like. Watch your head there. Get in there. Thanks. That was fun. No actual progress but, certainly a lesson in life - on the mean streets. - That's what cops do. We get a lead, we run it down. Most leads don't work out. We move on. You don't understand that, do you? All this kind of hard, methodical work we do is somehow beneath you... not your speed. Please, get off your horse. You wanted to frighten and impress me with your macho cop prowess. Understandable impulse. A little juvenile, perhaps. You shouldn't be working with us. - You're hurting people. You know that? - Who? The cops you work with. Don't kid yourself. Their careers are taking a hit. - If you care about 'em, you'll leave. - Cops I work with, meaning Lisbon? And her team. But mostly Lisbon. That ransom demand... Did she talk to you about that? Sure. And yes, it could mean there's someone on the inside. Be useful to know who it is, don't you think? We're working that, But the ransom drop's in three hours. We make a move on a suspect now, all it'll do is spook the kidnappers. They'll kill Mia, and they'll scatter. - We gotta make sure the girl is safe. - She's not gonna be safe. They'll kill her 5 minutes after they get the ransom. - Could happen. - So she dies either way. We could try something. - You want to hear what I have to say? - Not interested. OK, sure. I was very impressed, by the way, with the macho cop prowess. Those guys, they were genuinely frightened of you. You're absolutely cool. You're good out there. Go away. Bullitt. Like, really cool. Kojak. Sorry to disturb you. We're looking for an individual by the name of Deezer. Might have lived in the building or stayed with someone here. Never heard of him. What about the Crazy Hill Gang? Ever heard of them? If you do hear them, you call us at this number? You want me to spy on my neighbors? Fascists. Make a new friend, Bert? - Enough with the "Bert". - Sorry. Hurt your feelings? It's just not funny, that's all. It's a joke. You can't take a joke? Excuse me, ma'am, I'm with the CBI. - Could I ask you a few questions? - Sure, what about? I just think it's childish, that's all. And I just think you need to lighten up. Sorry. Never heard of him. All right. Thanks anyway. Maybe you need to grow up. Idiot. Not... you. Wayne Rigsby, CBI. Need to ask you a couple of questions. I was wondering if I could leave a card with you. Get in! Go! Hicks, cover the room! Go, go! Grace? - Went out the window. - I got it. Go! Just breath. I can't see any blood. The vest... I'm OK... Go! How you doing? They think a couple rounds probably broke a couple of ribs. They're gonna check for internal injuries. I'm fine. Really. Just... my legs keep twitching. Adrenaline. It'll wear off. Don't ever do this to me again. No problem. Go inside. See what, in the shooter's apartment, can tie her to the kidnapping. You okay? Hey, Rigsby. Thanks. My leg's still twitching. I love you. Thanks. I have to go. They don't even know I'm here. I'll call you later. One thing. What was that for? Next time... wear your vest. I mean it. I believe you. Get out of here. Is she all right? - Thank God. - Well, thank kevlar, actually. Hush. This is our fault. - What do you mean? - Rigsby said that he and Hicks were going at it when Van Pelt was shot. - That kind of bad blood starts with us. - She's right. This isn't about bad blood. It's about professionalism. There you go again. You won't take any responsibility. I. D. says the shooter's name is Diane Zaranski. - You're kidding. - Nope. D. Z. Deezer. Diane Zaranski was Colin Haymer's girlfriend. S. F. P. D. suspected her of being in the gang that kidnapped him. The Crazy Hill Gang. Same crew must have kidnapped Mia Westlake. We know for sure they have someone planted in the Westlake house. - That's the way they work. - We're running background checks on everybody that's been inside that house in the past six months. You'll catch anyone with a background check. - They plan too carefully for that. - You do know how to catch him. - Of course. I told you I do. - Forget it. - You're not even gonna hear him out? - He's got nothing to tell me. You know what? Jane's not the problem. You are. You're so stuck on the idea that he's not a cop you can't see what he is. You know how many cases he's closed for us? You think he's given me bad habits? I think he's made me a better cop. - Thank you, Lisbon. Can I just... - Be quiet! If you're so sure you're right that you won't even listen to him, then you're not a person I know. I did hear you out, and I still say no. Got the money and the instructions for the drop-off. - How much time? - About 20 minutes. - You're making a mistake. - Stop it. - I'm just... - Quiet! Mrs. Westlake, I need to speak to you privately. - Agent, I told you... - I know. Counselor, I'm sorry. Stay here. Come this way. Right in here. You're not welcome here. I'm gonna tell Minelli you refused to work with me. Face him. - How do you like that? - You really are a schoolboy. You know that? Just... We're gonna do... exactly as the kidnappers have asked. That is the best way to ensure that your sister will come home safely. But we're gonna do one thing. We're gonna put this small transmitter in the suitcase. - Why? - If they fail to return her, it's the best way for us to follow them. We think they're gonna take the money - to where your sister is. - Idiocy. - What was that, Mr. Jane? - This is ridiculous. You're gonna get that girl killed. There's something that you really should know. Keep talking. I'm gonna put my hands on you. One of the kidnappers is in this house right now. - Here? - A spy, a mole, reporting back to those that are holding your sister. We should be talking to them, not playing with "Star Wars" toys. - Oh, my God. Who? - Come here. Her. - You bitch! - What? Jeez! You crazy bitch! I'm gonna kill you! My money's on Verona. Sandborne's got her on experience, but it's hard to beat that kind of enthusiasm. Got the image up. - Nobody. - There will be. Somebody better come. If nobody does, you just killed Mia Westlake. Blame, blame, blame... Somebody's coming. Don't worry. And here they are. Hello, Mrs. Kent. The nanny. Should we go get her? Wait. Money's on its way. It's clean. They tried planting a tracker, but I caught it. Get the girl ready. - Hands where I can see 'em! - What's going on? Don't move. Don't do anything unless I tell you to. I don't understand. The baby is sleeping. The baby. She's been wandering around the house like a little lost lamb. You're just a terrible nanny. - Who you talking to on the phone? - My sister. - Is she a kidnapper, too? - No! What's this? Let me go. Let us have the money. - The girl might live. - Put your hands behind your back. You are making a bad mistake. If you people don't let me go right now, Mia Westlake will be tortured to death if they think you've done anything to me. No, they won't. We're gonna go get her. Good luck finding her. No need luck. Let's go. Checking... last number called. 767-555-0131. It's a landline. 1867 Cliff Point Circle, Oakland. Call Oakland P. D. Tell them we're taking the house. Get down! Drop your weapons! Thought I would resurrect an old tequila tradition. I'm in. Cheers. Smooth. Yes, it is. So am I someone you know now? I'm starting to recognize you, yeah. You know that thing you said about Jane making you a better cop. You don't believe that. I may have exaggerated for effect. Anyway, I wanted to say... that it's been nice working with you again. You, too. Anyhow... Good night. Good night. I've been thinking. You're not a cop. You never will be. But you have a... useful perspective. This is a summary of the Red John case since I took over. Take a look. Tell me what you think. - Don't thank me. - I wasn't going to. I need the actual case file... unabridged.
