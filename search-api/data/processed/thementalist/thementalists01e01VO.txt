- Agent Lisbon. Don't think we'll be needing you guys. We like the neighbor kid - who found the body. - Did he confess? He's a real squirrel. Did you kill her? Mercy's father would like to give a brief statement.</i> I just want to take a moment and thank everyone in law enforcement</i> and all the volunteers who helped us in the search for our beloved daughter.</i> The way that this entire community has come together to support me</i> and Juniper in this terrible time has been a great comfort to us.</i> And now I would just like to ask you... You give us some time, space and privacy to grieve for our daughter.</i> Thank you. Sync: Kasius Hello, Mrs. Tolliver. Who are you? My name is Patrick Jane. I'm here to help you. Would you like a cup of tea? Yes, I would, thank you. You must be tired. Why don't you sit down? It's nice and quiet in here, isn't it? Quiet, soothing, calm. Calm. I've been watching you and your husband, and I want you to know that I understand what you're feeling right now. You have no idea. Believe me. I do. I know. - I know, and I wanna help you. - You can't help me. What do you know? All sorts of things. You really only pretend to like skiing, right? You're pleased that your best friend recently gained some weight... About 10 pounds. You wish you'd been more adventurous when you were younger. You love India, but you've never been there. You have trouble sleeping. Your favorite color... is blue. I don't understand. You're... You're psychic? Just paying attention. I used to make a good living pretending to be a psychic. I tell you this because I want you to understand there's no point hiding things from me. Hiding... What? Know what I see when I look at your husband? I see a warm, loving, generous man. A little vain, maybe. Selfish, controlling... But a decent man. {\So w}Why do you suspect him of murdering your daughter? I don't. The McCluskey boy did it. That's what the police say. But you think they're wrong. Why? I don't know. Tell me. Last year, they have been so strange with each other. And neither one would admit{\ that} anything was wrong, and I think that... I think that she tried to tell me once, and I didn't... Did you ask him if he killed her? What would he say? Most wives can tell when their husbands are lying. I don't want tea. The McCluskey boy did it. Maybe. You think he did it, too? I trust a mother's instinct. There you are. Hi. Who are you? I'm the police. Did you kill your daughter? How dare you? I asked you a simple question, sir. Did you kill your daughter? I did not kill my daughter! Now you get the hell out of my house! What's the matter with you? - I'm gonna have your badge. - An innocent man would have punched me{\ by now}. I am gonna make life miserable for you. You come in here, you accost my wife, you cause trouble on... Honestly, it's not as bad as it looks. Mrs. Tolliver? Please wait. Front room's clear! Then the son of a bitch eagles 17. - Are you kiddin' me? - On that course? - A damn eagle? - That course never suited you, Price. - We'll do better in Orlando. - We have a nice spot on the draw. I'll tell you what. Davis Love III can kiss my butt. Alison? Flight 233 from Sacramento, you may claim your baggage from Carousel 2.</i> Sorry. You checked luggage? What are you, on vacation? Won't do it again. When your <i>trousseau</i> arrives, pick up the second rental, go direct to the sheriff's department, hustle us up a couple of rooms, - furniture and phone lines. - Yes. Ma'am. Come on. Morning, everybody. - How was your flight? - Go away. You're on suspension. Thank you. Mandated leave. - Ends next week. - So come back next week. - Hot enough for you? - Which one of you jackasses told him? - It was you, wasn't it, Cho? - Of course he called me. It's Red John. You can't keep me out of this. - Why would you want to? - You got a man killed. - There's consequences. - A man that murdered his daughter 'cause she wouldn't have sex with him{\ anymore}? You did not know that. If she hadn't had left a diary... But she did, though. Be reasonable. This is my case. - Your case? - Red John's mine. Red John doesn't belong to anyone. He belongs to me. It's not my call. Rules are rules. Come back next week. Don't let this man past. Boss? We have Gregory Tannen... Caucasian, male, 43, single. We haven't opened him up yet, - but... - Sorry I went over your head. I'll redeem myself, I promise. You want redemption? Be silent. I can learn to do that. Sorry. The burn marks here indicate that the victim was subdued with a stun gun... Standard civilian model by the look of it. Death appears to be caused by several blows to the back of the skull consistent with a bloodied golf club found at the scene. Female is Alison Randolph... 27, married, no children. They were found at her listed residence. TOD: looks to be early saturday evening. On Alison, we have the same stun gun marks, followed by binding with tight black plastic ligatures, frenzied cutting and stabbing assault of the torso - and subsequent abuse of the viscera. - Textbook Red John. - Who found the{\ *bodies}m? - This one's husband, coming home from the airport {\Sunday morning }with his brother. - {\He's a}A pro golfer. - Yeah? Price Randolph. What's her deal with him? {\Do w}We know? - He's on file as one of her physicians. - Making a house call? - Lovers? - No, this one's gay. Dr. Wagner might know what their relationship was. He's here to make the formal id? Dr. Wagner. I'm Agent Teresa Lisbon, California Bureau of Investigation. - What's your connection to the victims? - I work with {\Gregory}him... Dr. Tannen and the Randolph family are longtime clients of our practice. Are house calls the norm at your practice? - Gregory and Alison were close friends. - Lovers? No. He was gay. No, they were just... Friends. - What in God's name happened to them? - Looks like Red John. - Who's Red John? - We don't know who did this. We'll be in touch probably. Thank you. Red John enters here. Excuse me. He comes around here. He waits for her, expecting her to come in alone. Only thing, her friend Tannen chose the wrong night to come over for a Richard Gere and ice cream orgy. So Red John zaps 'em both with his trusty stun gun, and... Excuse me. Grabs a 5-iron from the bag here and... Crushes Tannen's skull. Then he takes his sweet time dealing with Alison how he likes. She's a nice big girl, so unless he's pretty strong, I'm guessing that he grabbed her by the arms and... He says he's sorry for all the pain he's caused you and your mother. Deeply sorry. He asks you to forgive him. Can you do that, Jenny? - He needs to hear it. - I forgive you, Daddy. Daddy, I forgive you. He's smiling now. They're tears of joy. He says, "God bless you and keep you." He's gone. Amazing. She's... Amazed. - Patrick... - One second. - Give him some time. - Absolu... Come on back to us. - I'm back. Thank you. - Back. Patrick, I understand that you're also sort of a paranormal detective. Is that right? I try to help the police when I can. And you're helping them hunt this... scary serial killer. What's his name? - Red John. - There she blows... Classic Red John smiley face. Drawn in the victims' blood, clockwise with three fingers of his right hand, wearing a rubber kitchen glove. I'm stoked to finally see one in the flesh. This isn't Red John. Right. Red John thinks of himself as a showman, an artist. He has a strong sense of theater. In all the previous killings, he made sure the first thing that anyone sees is the face on the wall. You see the face first, and you know... You know what's happened, and you feel dread. Then and only then you see the body of the victim... Always in that order. Here it's the opposite. The first thing you see is the body, and you have to look around to see the face on the wall. - Doesn't play nearly as well, does it? - Depends on your taste, I suppose. The killer could have painted on the correct wall here, but he didn't because he didn't know better because he isn't Red John. Interesting. You know what your problem{\ is, my friend}? You enjoy your work a little too much. You're a ghoul. If you don't get horny reading <i>Fangoria</i>, I'm Britney Spears. I resent that. This is you trying to redeem yourself, is it? I'm sorry. He irks me. He's irksome. You don't need me here. - This one doesn't fit the pattern. - So Jane was right. We have a copycat. Or we have Red John trying new things, or we have Red John making a mistake. We don't know. We'll work the evidence until we do know. - Go talk to the husband. - Will do, boss. What are you waitin' for? So you might be right about this case. Might be. Thanks for the insight. Did I say that? I'm acknowledging the fact that you might be right, that's all. I mean, if you wanted to come back, I couldn't stop you. Fine. I'm asking you to come back. Because. Because you're useful to the team. I won't say "Please". Go screw yourself. Jackass. Good morning. Can I help you? You must be Van Pelt. Pleasure. Patrick Jane. Hi. Good to meet you. - Agent Cho said you had left town. - No. Nowhere to go. Do you want that desk over there or this one? - I mean, that one gets more light. - That one. More light by all means. Very pleasant addition to the serious crimes family. When did you get here? Stop. I give up. Stop. Please, stop. Turn off the camera.</i> - Come on, come on, that's enough. - Okay, we're done.</i> You are just awful! I lost a beautiful, precious angel. Yes, sir. Good-looking woman. I'm jumping right in if you don't mind. You missed the tournament cut on Friday. But you didn't come home until Sunday. What did you do{\ with the rest of your time} in Fresno? I get this. You guys can't catch the real killer, - so you wanna lay this one on me? - No, sir. If we have that confirmation{\ of where you were}, it lets us exclude you from the investigation. I was with a massage therapist. Name? It had "lady" - in there somewhere. - It'll be on his credit card bill. There you go. Pleasure meeting you boys. We're a full-service private practice. We deliver primary care, cosmetic surgery, psychotherapy, sports medicine... You name it. What's the african connection? It's what this place is all about. Half our profits go to build and staff basic health clinics in poor african communities. Here we are. It's a thin file. Alison was a healthy young woman. - Psychiatric history? - She didn't have one. STDs? Abortions? Unexplained injuries? Except for some routine checkups with me, it's all Dr. Tannen... - All aesthetic work. - Did Tannen keep a diary? Our last case was solved because the victim kept a diary. Diary? I don't think so. Getting back to Alison Randolph... How was her marriage, do you think? Happy? Unhappy? About six months ago, Dr. Tannen asked my advice. {\Alison had}She asked him to get her a year' supply of birth control pills off the books, which is strictly against AMA code. I said sure, do it. Better us than some Tijuana drugstore. Why the secrecy? Price Randolph had a vasectomy, April of '02. - If there's anything else I can do... - I appreciate that. Actually, there is. I'm out of sleeping pills. Can you fix me up? Anything strong will do. Sure. Come in for a consultation. We'll squeeze you in this afternoon. I was hoping to get something now. Trying to avoid the chitchat. I'm sorry. I wouldn't feel comfortable prescribing without some sort of "chitchat." I understand. No problem. I'll call you... Maybe. I like the husband for it. He hires some hooker{\ he knows} to create an alibi, flies home, fillets the spouse, flies back again. The classic elaborate and clever but ultimately stupid plan. Have you looked at his PGA tournament record? It's not bad. 6 mil career earnings. For coming in second and third. You put him on the 18th tee with a big one on the line, like night follows day, he'll shank it. He's a choker. He doesn't have the nerve to kill his wife. Didn't do it. Should{\Are you suggesting} we drop a prime suspect because he's never won a major? I'm just making idle conversation. How'd you do that? Telekinesis. He blew on it. That is another way to do it. Mr. Jane, I have a question - regarding your previous career path. - Fire away. When you met with other psychics... Real psychics... Could they tell you were just pretending? There's no such thing as real psychics. I beg to differ. My cousin Yolanda is a psychic. Your cousin is deluded or dishonest, or both. Steady. He's entitled to his opinion. He's wrong, though. - She has power. - Thank you. She can communicate with the other side. I've seen her do it myself. She let you speak with someone that's gone. Someone that you love and still miss very much. You wanted her power to be real, so it was. You're so sure you're right. Science don't know everything. 500 years ago, radio would've seemed like magic. Exactly. {\500 years i}In the future, it could be{\ totally} normal to communicate with the other side. The "other side." Your father's a football coach. - How'd you know that? - It's obvious from your whole demeanor. My point is, didn't Dad always say, "Life is like football? "When that final whistle blows, the game is over." Done. There is no more. There is no "other side." This is it... Lobster and bread rolls and nautical kitsch. And then... Nothingness. You poor, sad man. The kingdom of God is a real place. Later tonight, when Rigsby asks you to come back to his hotel room... Say yes. - Excuse me? - I know. You were planning on refusing him very curtly. First week on the job, you wanna set a tone. No monkey business. But why not? Rigsby is an excellent lover, I'm sure. Tough but fair. Right? Right. The kingdom of God is a real place, and you have an immortal soul. I do so hope you're wrong. - Good night. - Later, dude. This is... me. Welcome to the unit, Agent Van Pelt. Thank you, Agent Rigsby. She explodes into action, reaching up to 60 miles per hour. She easily outruns her terrifying prey. "Greetings, old friend. It's been a while. "I hope you are keeping well. I am thriving and happy. "I have 12 wives now and will soon begin courting number 13. "Why can't you catch me? "You must feel so powerless and stupid and sad. "Oh, well. All the best. "Red John." That sounds like the real deal to me. Sounds like Red John. It's not. Red John wouldn't risk capture - just to taunt me. - The{\ real} killer{\'s trying to} wanna throw us offtrack? Cho, find out where Price Randolph was a half an hour ago. Rigsby, I want you to check the hotel security cameras. Get those over to forensics. - You okay? - Absolutely. Get some sleep. - Hello? - Good morning. You didn't sleep, did you? I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. Wagner, please. It's urgent. Jane. Patrick Jane. Yeah, I'll hold. Forensics maybe got a break. The blood on the cloth in the envelope is Alison Randolph's. But they found a hair in there... Doesn't belong to her or Tannen. Guess who itdoesbelong to. It's yours, Tag. Amazing, huh? Science. This is insane. I didn't kill Alison. How do you explain your hair in the envelope?</i> Either it was a mistake, or... - Or I'm being framed. - Who would want to frame you?</i> We don't want to, if that's what you're thinking.</i> - He and Alison were lovers. - <i>Who would want to frame you, Tag?</i> My brother. Why would he want to do that? Alison and I were lovers. I think you are psychic. You're just afraid to admit it. Why is it you can't sleep? Because I can't get the good pills without talking to a doctor. And you don't like talking to doctors. They always wanna be the smartest person in the room, don't they? When in fact that's me, obviously. You protect your core self very fiercely. What {\do you think }is the reason for that? You know, this is exactly how I imagined it would be. You gonna ask me about my mother? - Do you want me to{\ ask you about your mother}? - I just wanna sleep. So what is it that keeps you awake? - What's his name? - Red John? That's right. Red John. He's killed at least eight women that we know of. The police asked me to try and get a psychic fix on him, to see if I could get a sense of who{\ this man} he is. How do you do that exactly, get a psychic fix on someone? Well, Davis, true demonic evil burns like fire. It burns with a terrible cold, dark flame. I force myself to look into that flame, and I see an image of the evildoer... In this case, Red John. He's an ugly, tormented little man. A lonely soul. Sad, very sad. "Dear Mr. Jane, I do not like to be slandered in the media, "especially by a dirty money-grubbing fraud. "If you are a real psychic instead of a dishonest little worm, "you wouldn't need to open the door to see "what I've done to your lovely wife and child." Mr. Jane? What is it that keeps you awake? When I was a boy, we had a farm. It's a lot of work. I was kind of a lazy kid. Yes? I'd always be trying to get my{\ little} brother Jimmy to do my chores for me. One day, I promised him a dollar if he'd cut the firewood. He opened up an artery in his leg on the saw, and he bled to death... Died... Doing my chores for me. You know... That's almost exactly the same thing that happened to Johnny Cash. Is it really? That's spooky. - Mr. Rando... - Cut the crap. My brother's done nothing. {\And y}You{\ scumbags} haven't got the stones to come after me, so you come after my family. That is{\ flat-out} persecution. - Price, what did we agree? - Rest assured, there's no intent to persecute you. We{\ scumbags} are holding your brother 'cause we have physical evidence linking him to the crime and potential motive in that he states whenever you weren't around, he was banging your wife{\ like a big bass drum}. Tag and Alison? That's what he states. He further states that{\ it was} you{\ that} killed Alison, - and you're{\ now} trying to frame him{\ in revenge}. - What'd you say? Bastard! You treated her like trash! What did you expect?! I didn't expect my little brother to be banging my wife! You bastard! Everything you've told me is total fiction, isn't it? Why? I can tell you're in real pain. Why not tell the truth? The truth is mine. - I hear ya. - Thank you. Remember, we were talking about Tannen the other day, I asked you if he kept a diary, and you said he did? - There's no diary among his effects. - No. I'm sorry, no? No. You have it wrong. I didn't think he kept a diary. Strange. Then it must have been someone else who told me. Either that or I'm going mad. But I definitely, 100% remember hearing that Tannen kept a diary. Well, that is strange, but why does it matter if he kept a diary? It doesn't matter. Only I was thinking, why do magicians have beautiful girl assistants? Why? Because they're reliable distracters of attention. People will look at a beautiful girl for a long time before they look where they should be looking if they wanna see how the trick really works. Anyhow, I'll send over a couple of forensics guys tomorrow to search his office and locate that diary. Didn't they already search his office? They never do it thoroughly the first time. Once more for luck. It's gotta be there somewhere. Thanks for everything, doc. - Good night. - Good night. Lost something? - How did you get in? - Door was open. I think I left my phone in your office. - The door wasn't open. - Must have been. Here I am. What are you doing? I confess, the temptation to play detective was a little too strong. I was looking for that diary. - I got a little carried away. - No kidding. No diary? No diary. Maybe I should have a gander. I'm good at finding things. Be my guest. Eureka. Dr. Wagner, thanks for your help. Mr. Jane. Your phone. Right. Thanks. Yeah. Got it. Silly of me. - Well, good-bye again. - Wait. Give me the diary. - It's very amusing. - I try. I knew. I knew it might be a trick, but I... I had to be sure. That's how the trick works. What led you to me? Not that I'm saying I did it. I'm just asking. When we first met, you said you didn't know who Red John was, but you have books on criminal psychiatry... there... That have chapters on him. You're the Randolph family doctor, so you could{\ easily} get a strand of Tag's hair, and, being a doctor, you could hack up another human without difficulty. It's obvious it was you. That's it? You have nothing. - That's just guesswork. - I know. I just wanted to be sure I had the right answer. I was surprised. I gotta be honest. You don't seem to be a wicked man. But you are. You're angry about the letter. Yeah, it was a bit mean-spirited. For the record, I'm sorry about your family. I can only imagine your pain. I'm not... a wicked man. - My conscience is clear. - Really? Right now in Africa, there's 3,000 beautiful children alive today who should be dead, but they aren't because of me. Tannen was gonna ruin me and destroy all that work... Over nothing. Money. "Theft," he called it. "Embezzlement." Self-righteous idiot. It's simple math. If I go to jail, thousands of kids will die. So I made a rational, moral decision to kill Tannen... For the greater good. And Alison? What did she do wrong? As you said, she was the magician's assistant, just a distraction. If only Tannen died, the police would've been all over this place, wouldn't they? Truly, is killing two any worse than killing one, when so many lives are at stake? I don't think so. You poor, sad man. - You're under arrest. Let's go. - I'm pointing a gun at you. You really think I would set you up so nicely and let you pull a loaded gun on me? I took the bullets out earlier. - You're late! Draw your weapon! - What? Drop the gun! Hands on your head. Get down on your knees. Down. Closed case doughnuts are here. I just went to get sleeping pills, I swear{\ to God}. I didn't even wanna go. - You know I didn't want to go. - Right. Yeah, you didn't set Wagner up... Didn't figure it was him days ago. You didn't let us tear apart the victim's family simply to satisfy your childish need for drama. That family was screwed anyway. Don't blame yourselves, guys. Don't even start. I'm still angry. - I'm sorry. - No, you're not.
