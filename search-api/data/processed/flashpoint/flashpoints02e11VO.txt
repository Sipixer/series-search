See,right now,the subject is inactive. And by "the subject," you mean the gunman. Zero fatalities,two injuries.Sounds like they were unplanned. Which affects our subject profile,which affects our response. Okay,and what about the injured? We're on it!Sir. Boss,I'm not liking this cafeteria. It's too open. Sitting ducks. Parker: Yeah,agreed.Let's evacuate the lunchroom. And,uh,any stray kids you find in the hallway,get them into classrooms, safe and out of the way. spike,we need to know who this kid is and what he wants. I'm on it,boss.
