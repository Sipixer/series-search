Uh, maybe you don't know this, but... phoebe has been on the waiting list for 14 months. I really have to apologize. She's first in line. She's been first in line for a month. This is not a deli counter, mr. Swanson. oh, heather, could you please explain to him. Look, she was here already once last week. She was prepped and everything, but the heart was flawed. Do you know what that's like? - Considering the travel time of this organ... - yeah. The window of survivability is shorter. So, then why are we standing here? In this situation, the computer selects the recipient closer to the hospital. closer? Closer.Look, the only reason we were at home is because the hospital told us to go home to prepare ourselves to say goodbye. - Did your computer tell you that? - Mr. Swanson!

Critical incident: Multiple hostages taken, st simon's hospital, 11:01 am. We've been here five minutes; we don't have a name, yet? It's jack swanson. This is heather, she's a nurse. We need an address for jack swanson, s-w-a-n-s-o-n, and detective units to canvas area friendlies. - His daughter's a patient? - Phoebe. She was just discharged to spend her last days at home, so she lost her spot in line for a heart transplant. So he's having a bad day, guys. - And where's the heart? - It's en route. How long is it viable? More than an hour and we run into trouble. That doesn't leave us a lot of time, guys. Hey, sarge, you want to get an early start, we'll feed you on the fly? Yeah. Yeah, I'm game. Heather, do you mind sticking around? Lew, wordy, I'm comin' out. Let's see if we can get mr. Swanson home. Jack's a single father, self-employed, handyman. Do you think he's the type of guy to fire a gun? I don't know. He's a regular guy. I think he just sort of... snapped. Jack swanson? This is the police, strategic response unit. How you doin'? okay, three nurses here, one surgeon. Immobilized patients here, here, here and here. It's fish in a barrel. Where's the subject? He's here, in the cicu. East hallway's sterile. Sterile? Means the subject has no shot unless he moves. What if he moves? Everything changes. no-no-no-no-no. No. It's all right, these guys are with me. They don't move unless I say so. 11:07 am, sgt. Greg parker begins negotiation. It's my job to help you and I want to make sure know one gets hurt. I want you to back off! Can't do that, jack. We're gonna stay right here. Is it all right if I call you jack? My name's greg. Hey, I mean it! Let's just talk, okay? How's his home life? There's just the two of them. They're pretty close. His wife died. Do you know how? She was killed in a car accident. Jack was driving. He's suffering from survivors guilt over his wife's death. Sounds like you're pretty upset about something. Maybe I can help. What do you think? I want you to turn the tv's back on. My daughter was watching tv, all right? He wants his daughter's eyes on the tv, not him. Let's get something from him first. 'Kay, I'll start working on that. In the meantime, why don't you tell me why we're here today? What's this all about, jack? It's about saving my daughter's life! All right. What's your daughter's name? We've got two civilians in the O.R. Here, and a group near the subject, here. We already know why the perp's here. He's a subject, not a perp. He's a guy with a gun. He's a father in trouble. You ask questions, sam, you show him that you're listening. All right. Thanks. Heart's here. Yeah, that's fine. Let's just make sure we keep it out of the way, okay? So your daughter's been waiting for a heart, is that right, jack? Yeah. She's been waiting over a year! She can't wait any more. I understand. So let's work together and... see if we can figure something out, okay? But, jack, right now, I'm sorry, but I need to ask you a little favour. Can you just let me know how everyone's doing over there? Because when I talk to my bosses they're gonna want to make sure everyone's safe and uh... I can't really see too well from over here, so... I need to know that they're okay. Can you ask them for me? - you okay? - Dad. I gotta do this, sweetheart. I gotta. You're okay? Okay. You guys okay? Yeah, they're okay. How 'bout the other patient? Is the other patient okay? are you-you... are you okay? yeah. He's okay. Thank you, jack. You did real good. Harder to hurt someone you connect to. 'Cause then they're real people too. Everyone's fine. Jack did a real good job here. So how we doing on those tv's for phoebe? What's your take, jules? Think he's doing good. 11:14, parker initiates stockholm. Tv demand granted. It's gotta be a less lethal option. Let me shoot the gun, problem solved. - Too risky. - I won't miss. Gun fragments, civilians, we don't get away with collateral damage here, sam. We need to isolate him. 11:15, forensic physiologist arrives on scene. Good morning, luria here. Morning, doc. Subject is jack swanson, in transition from red to yellow, he's responsive to stockholm. No flies on you guys. No, he's workin' the greg parker magic. Let me access meds and mentals; I'll get right back to you. hey, they said I should talk to you. I'm jack swanson's home nurse. Why don't you just tase his ass? Muscle spasm - he'll pull the trigger. So we go in hard tactical. Yeah, I was just gettin' at that. Look, there's something I need you to do. All right, see these stairs here? That's where we came in, right? I want you to make a reverse entry. Go across this hallway, these doors here, I need you to go through them. Now be careful because that's a big road. I want you to cross it. I want you to make an entry into this timmy'S. I'll have a double double. - Jules? - Cream, no sugars. - Spike? - No, I'm good. You serious? You went all coffee-shop on his ass. Do you think we can talk a little about the last few weeks; what that's been like for him? - Sure. - Great. Is that phoebe's? Yes. And now they wanna give her heart to somebody else and they expect to what? Just walk away? Heart's still en route, boss. She's your daughter. That's right. Like, see, you get it, right? You just want to help her. You got kids, right? I can tell you love her a lot, jack. You got kids? yeah, I do. A boy. - What's he doing? - What? Negotiating 101: Never lie to the subject. He's not lying; he has a kid. Really? Before your time. Jules, she reckons jack hasn't slept in three days. So we're looking at impaired cognitive function and irritability. Emotional volatility, impulsiveness... hey, any word? Any word? Yeah, the heart, it needs to get up there or it dies. Well, then you'd better get it up there. Fourth floor. Hey, this area's still restricted. That sru guy just cleared me. He's 16. He's gonna be 16 next week. So you know what that's like. Come on, you come home every day to your kids and they keep you going. It's true, kids keep you going. So can you imagine losing that? Yeah, yeah, I can imagine. I mean, you'd do anything for your kid, right? Uh, what's his name? - Dean. - Dean. What would you do? Come on, help me out a little bit here, what would you do? What's going on? We got a breach. Wordy, go. - Trouble. - That's the heart, right? - Jack! Jack, just stay with me. - That's her heart. Excuse me, excuse me, I'll take that. Give it to me! Give it to me! - He's got the heart. - How the hell? Get those elevators locked off. Come here! Out the door you came in. Go! - Okay, back off. - Okay, jack. Keep the gun down, okay? What do we do now? Well, we... we got the page, I got heart, so I think you know what we do. they've already done her blood and urine tests, so they should start her immunosuppressants. Now, let's get this thing done. Doc, you stay where you are. Spike, take over as secondary. - Jules. - Gotcha. - He needs to be prepped for surgery. - No, he's going nowhere. Jack, let's just think this thing through. That's going to my daughter! Just calm down, jack. Think this through. All right, hold it right there! Hold it! Stop! - Calm down, we all go home safe. - Got the solution. Stop, stop, stop-stop-stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop, stop! - Safety's on, safety's on. - Less lethal, go. Stop. shot fired. Shot fired. Officer down. Wordy? I didn't mean that! Wordy? I'm okay. Vest. We're holding fire. We're holding fire. I'M... so sorry! - We're holding fire, jack. - Holding fire. Wordy, I'm pulling you back. copy. 11:28, heart breached the perimeter. Subject re-escalated to red. Jack, listen to me, okay? That was not what you meant to do. Jules, stay ready. No, I didn't mean it. He's okay, jack. You okay, mr. Wordsworth? I'm all right! He's okay, jack. You see? Your bullet hit his vest and that's a good thing. And it's a good thing that I was here and I saw that you didn't mean to use that gun on my friend, right? yeah, no, I-I didn't mean it. Okay, of course you didn'T. And I trust you on that, so now you gotta trust me, okay? We're running out of time on that heart, jack. What do ya say, we give it to the doc? I can't do that. Jack. Spike. We need to get him out of the waiting area. We need an empty room. Hey, look, you gotta start prepping my daughter for surgery now, okay? Doc, don't you need to make tests on the heart to make sure it's usable? Yes. We need to examine the heart for tissue damage during transport. Okay, well, we wanna... see that heart taken care of, right, jack? Yeah, okay, but I stay with it. Well... can you do that, doc? - Don't you need a sterile environment? - We do. Then that's a problem, jack. You see, that gun, that gun isn't sterile. Remember what we said about... doing everything we can for our kids? This is one of those things. Okay. Okay. All right. Uh, h-h-he stays right here. Okay, jack. It's not fair. It was his decision. What was? She was dying and they made him choose and he chose to take phoebe back home. He must feel like it's his fault. Come on, what's going on, guys ? We can't isolate jack. Well, let's keep working on that then. - Are these two O.R.'S side by side? - Yes. - Spike, you bring charges? - Yeah. We're gonna need rappelling gear, too. Wordy, you take over here for spike. Boss? This is what I'm thinking. We maybe got an option B. We gotta get phoebe into O.R.One. Spin it to jack, no promises. Lewis, you good to go on my call? Copy. All right, we're runnin' outta time. Let's keep up with the intel. Get the boss something he can work with. - Jack. - Yeah. They're still doing some tests on the heart. Now, nothing's new and no promises, but we want to move phoebe into the O.R. And get her ready just in case. Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah, that would... that'd be great. Okay. Hey, thank you. jules, subject is moving. Take your white hallway. Go, go, go. Meds and mentals: Pretty clean mental history. Prescription for ssri anti-depressants after his wife's death. A home nurse says his family's overseas. We've got less than a half hour on the heart. We've got nowhere to go. There's civilians everywhere - O.R., Icu. Our only solution is lethal. We saving jack or are we saving the heart? What are you doing? Come on, move him back. Come on, move him back. Okay, jack. Move him back. You step away. Leave him there. Sierra one? In position. Lew, jules is on him. Lewis, you take a break. Keep 'em on the happy stuff. Sam! Sending up the heart, that was you? Yeah, it was running out of time, I assumed... never, never assume, sam. If it looks simple it's usually not. You tossed in a lit match and left your team to put out the fire. Is everyone all right? In the spirit of fostering a little mutual trust? Belongs to the girl? I should bring it up, maybe it would help. Good idea. It's rocket time. Now, gianni won the poll for both races here last year. There's ten laps to go. yeah. Gianni's leading, but it doesn't mean anything. Garrity's five back, but he'll save his juice for the last two. He's just like capretti. Daytona '98. Did you see it? I was there. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, a friend of mine went to summer camp with capretti and uh... he got us in. Vip treatment. So you went with your, what, your son? Yeah. Yeah, we got to go down into the pit. Capretti gave dean one of his race gloves. shut up. You watch with phoebe? Oh, yeah. So is your boy, dean, a fan? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I mean, I don't know. I haven't seen my son in a long time. I'm sorry, what? I haven't seen him in nine years. Now, wait a second, you just said that your kid's your life. Yeah, it's true, he is. No, you said you knew what it was like; that you come home every day to your kid. Not exactly. What I said was... what I said was... He said, "you come home every day to your kids, it keeps you going." You said, "it's true, your kids keep you going." I said, "it's true, they keep you going." I didn't say, "I see him every day." I said, "they keep you going." And that's true. My wife left with dean nine years ago and I tried to turn a lot of things around so I could be a better guy... a better dad, but uh... I don't, I don't know if he still likes stock car. I don't know what his shoe size is, jack. I lost my chance. I lost my chance. But this thing you're trying o do for your daughter here, I understand that. I really understand that, and I can't say that I wouldn't do the same thing. But at the end of the day, you gotta be there for her. No, no, you know what? It doesn't matter. Thing is, it doesn't matter that I'm there for her. What matters... is that she has her life. That's it. That's important. So um... where's the heart anyway? Why haven't they taken it in to phoebe? boss, the heart, we're almost out of time. There's only 15 minutes left. All right, I'm breaking a lot of rules here, jack. Okay? But the truth is... they're not gonna let phoebe have that heart. No, no, you said that they were working on it? That's what... that's something negotiators do. We stall for time, we pass the buck, we stretch the truth, but uh, I don't want to lie to you, jack. What's he doing? He knows we're at the end of the line. - Yeah, but you can'T... - he knows what he's doing. I could keep asking them. I can keep asking them and asking them, but the thing is, is that... they are never gonna let you have that heart. Yes. No, no. Yes, they will. They will. Jack, one guy walks into a place with a gun and gets what he wants, the next thing you know, a whole bunch of guys are thinking, "hey, maybe I can get the same thing." That becomes a big problem, jack. I know you're tired, buddy. I know you're tired. There's a chance your daughter will get another heart. You still have a chance, if let him go; if you let them do their work. okay. All right. Okay. it's gonna be okay. Go. Thank you, jack. Go on. That was a good choice, jack. It was a good choice. What's your take jules? Gone from red to yellow. Now, let's get him off this gurney and onto... now, just put the gun down, on the floor. You stay away from me. Okay, you said that this heart wasn't gonna go to waste. Is that right? No solution. No solution. This is not good. This is option B. Sierra one, prepare to trade up. Go, go. I told you to stay away from me! Jack, don't do it. I told you to stay out! Jack, look at this man. Look at him. His name... is william. Jack. - You don't have to do this. - Yes, I do! Yes, I do! Boss, there's minutes left on the heart. You have to do something. - Jack, I'm sorry. - what? I'm sorry, jack, but the tests came back and the heart's damaged. well, I don't believe ya! Jack, you could use that gun, but I'm telling you, it'll be for nothing. So you can decide to do something for nothing or you can go into that other room over there and you can be with your daughter. Maybe she gets another chance. Maybe another heart comes through. You gotta believe it will. But, right now, what do you think phoebe wants? Right now? if you want to see your daughter... go see phoebe, jack. We'll back off. Is this something you needed? spike and jules, standby. Subject moving, he's still armed. Police! Get down! Get the gun! Get the gun! - Don't move! Don't move! - Stay down! - Do not move! - Stay down! I'm sorry. You said the heart was no good. Yeah, I wanted to keep you safe. You said you knew what it was like, but you don't know. You don't know what it's like! - You all right, sarge? - Yeah. Let's go. 11:53 am. Subject contained, incident resolved. You re-escalated him.
