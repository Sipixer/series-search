with the Police Strategic Response Unit.</i> There have been security concerns in the mall,</i> and we are working quickly to ensure your safety.</i> Okay, let's sweep and clear with extreme caution. Subject is armed and volatile. Police want everyone out now. Please hurry! Anyone else here?! Tasha. I just killed a girl. Tasha, where are you? So... I just wanted to say... I just wanted to say I'm sorry. 5 hours earlier Hi, how did... how'd it go last night? Oh, I had her in the palm of my hand. Candles, a little Egyptian musk. A little boom-shacka-lacka on the iPod. - So, what went wrong? - Steaks. I might as well have cooked her my shoe. I told you before about the charcoal grill. - Yeah. - Charcoal: no wonder. You can't control the heat. Gas, all the way. And you marinate the thing overnight. Yeah, you do. You marinate it. - If you're gonna be like that. - T-bone, there's a nice cut. Be like what? My steaks got nothing but the juices they're born in. Marbled with fat. Porterhouse, rib-eye. Some olive oil, tomato paste. Mom? Mama, I gotta go to work. What time is it? It's almost 5:00. I don't want to be late. Tasha... Dinner's in the microwave. Just gotta rember to take the tinfoil off before you... I know how to do it. Are you up? Or do you want me to set an alarm? I'm fine, all right? I just need another hour. Mom... I know it can be hard sometimes, but if you just get up, you're going to feel better. Okay, I know you can do this. Not right now. Please. Okay. Yeah. So, I'll see you later? - What's happening? - We've got a visitor. - What's going on, liar? - What's up, slut? - Sam, vest. - I just qualified. That was last week. Come on. Start hanging out in the donut shop, we're gonna know. - You gonna get that? - None of your business. - Who is it? Parker, 205. - It's no one... Ed... Hello. Jules' phone. Who's this? Carlotti, 175. Todd? Oh, Scott. Scotty. Oh, it's just Scott. Okay, sorry. - Wordsworth, 190. - No, it's Edward, her personal assistant. Well, I will ask her. You, uh, you want to go out with him tonight? You... is this... second date? It's the... it's the third. She would love to see you tonight, Scooter. Yeah, I'll ask her. Movie? You know, we can't do that. We're working late. What about... what about, uh, bowling? Excellent, I'll have her call you. Thank you, sir. Bye-bye. - Braddock, 180. - What's the word? - Sorry, Greg, you're it. - What? - Oh, an outrage! - Oh, come on. - I demand a reweighing. - You're first, Mr. Wordsworth. Let's go. - You're first up. - Come on, boss, you and me. Let's go, chubby. If you can drag the heaviest guy, you can save everybody on your team. Okay. All right, be gentle. It'll hurt me more than it hurts you, you know that, right? Yeah. Yeah, Jules. What? That was great. She just moved like 250 pounds. I was being supportive. Hey, rember what you saw. Girl just saved your life. You don't have to close tonight. I can do it. You look tired. No, it's... it's my turn. I'll... I'll close. Jackie, I'm fine. It's been two weeks now like this. What is going on? Tash. Mom's a nightmare. School's worse. Same old. Can I take my break now? Yeah, sure. I'll be here. - Hey, Tasha. - Hey, I gotta go. Tasha doesn't wash her hands after she goes to the bathroom. Spreading her germs everywhere. Yeah, just like her lies. So, why'd you do it, Tasha? Why'd you open your mouth to the cops? Yo, she ignoring you? She said, "Why did you lie to the cops?" Wasn't a lie. No way Michael would do that. Believe what you want. My break is over. Oh, you gotta go, huh? Hit her head! Yeah, punch her! - Grab her arms. - Bring her over here. - Get off of me. - Over here. - Get off of me! - Hold still. Hold her down. When we're done with you, no one will want to get with you ever again. - Help! Help me, please. - Shut up! Keep your mouth shut. - Bitch! - Cassaundra, watch the door. - No, no! - Erin, keep her still. Shut up, bitch! - Get off me, please. - Hold still. - Somebody help me! - Shut up. Oh, no, look at her. And this... this is nothing compared to what I'm gonna do to you if you ever lie to the cops again. Maybe we should just do this now. Michael's heat. You're going to come. Now nobody has to look at her nasty little face again. Brianna! Brianna! - Oh, man. - Come on. We have to go. - We have to go right now. - What about Cassaundra? - We can't leave her here! - We got no choice. We find Tasha right now, and we kill her. Let's go. CREDITOS Team One, gear up. Paradise Square. Shots fired. Unknown subject.</i> First responders have established a perimeter.</i> - Head of security? - Yes, sir. All the exits are locked. That's good. You probably trapped our shooter or shooters. Along with about four or 500 civilians? The mall employees are on alert, but the shoppers are starting to realize they can't get out. - Got anything else? - That's it. - I'm going to need your P.A. - You got it. Let's find out who and what we're dealing with. What do you got, Lou? She's gang. Numbers on her arm. Definitely not random. All right, Lou, you're going to be with me. Jules, Sam, take a look at the scene. - Got it. - Sir. - Spike, Wordy, witnesses. - Copy. Hey, buddy, we're going to need need full access to floor plans and CCTV footage for the last 30 minutes. No problem. Follow me. The security office, top floor. Needle in a haystack. Critical incident: Paradise Square. Shots fired, 7:51 PM. - Establishing command post. - Start sweeping street level. Copy that. Sally, call in Team Two. Copy. And we're going to need extra coppers on the escalators, the elevators, and the street parking. But you don't know whether it was three or four girls that ran past you on the stairs? Okay, now think back. Try and narrow it down a little bit. These kids... are they about this big? - I don't know. - This big? - I don't, I don't know what I saw. - It's all right. It's okay. All right, thanks, thanks very much. Boss, witnesses saw teenagers bolt out of a restroom and up the stairs. Three teenage girls, four teenage girls, three girls and a boy, could be seven orangutans. How about a little less information and a little more intelligence? Copy. - Lou, you crack the tatt? - No, not yet. Sarge, we're starting the sweep, but we have people moving</i> all over the place. How about a little crowd control?</i> Negative. Not yet. Our shooters might still think they're getting out of here tonight, and if I announce our presence to the whole mall, we'll have mass panic. They might try to fire their way out. - They're dormant; we wait. - Yeah, give me more who and why. Copy that. Okay, our victim's tattoo is a number. 2-3-3-1-8-5-2-3. It's code for W-CREW. Winchester Crew. Nice, Lou. Jules, Sam, what you got? Single bullet hole. Looks like a. 38 There is also a stray backpack left behind, but there's no wallet or apparent ID. All right. Copy that. We'll get K-9 down. Sarge. Yeah, Jules. There's blood on the floor, blond hair. I'm guessing a makeover, I'm guessing female, and I'm guessing that it was not voluntary. I've checked security's photos of known gang members.</i> She's not up here, but she's definitely Winchester Crew. So if her shooter's in a rival gang, we're looking at a high-risk subject. Not averse to hands-on violence. Could be inter-gang stuff, vendetta maybe, but...</i> I don't know, I'm thinking that there's another victim here, and it feels personal to me. It's not random; it's not Trolley Square. Possible grudge match. Okay, time to go wide. Go ahead. Attention, shoppers, may I have your attention, please. My name is Sergeant Gregory Parker with the Police Strategic Response Unit.</i> There has been a security incident in the mall,</i> and we are working quickly to ensure your safety.</i> You can help us by exiting all shops and calmly walking toward the central areas of the mall. Once in the central areas, kindly sit on the floor</i> and clasp your hands behind your head. This will make our job much easier, much faster, and we can all get out of here.</i> Thank you. Bri, come on, we got to get out of here. Yo, lockdown. It doesn't matter either way. We have to find Tasha now. Look at your arm, Erin. What if you were two inches to the right? - Bri, come on... - This is on us. All right, Crew finds out we didn't deal with this, we're the ones they're going to blame. So you want to live your life? Huh?! You want to live your life? Nothing's changed. We kill Tasha now. K-9's got a scent. All right, let the dogs go. Jules, paint me a picture. Okay. A textbook, grade 11, Junction High, no name. A few books, she's a reader. Keychain, two keys... Sally, get me names of kids at Junction Street High with known gang association. Copy. - Sergeant, we got it. There's our. 38. - Roll it back. There. Freeze it there. Lewis, check those images against the wall. Team One, we got four females: one shooter, three witnesses. ED 5'4" to 5'8", jeans and hoodies. Sweep and clear... fast is good.</i> Fan out from the hot spot: Jules and Sam: north end.</i> - Copy. - Copy. ED Wordy and Spike, South. - Copy. - Copy.</i> They're all hoodrats, Sarge. It's hard to say. Then you're with me. Let's go. Sally, names of female Winchester Crew first and put Dr. Luria on standby. Eyes on possible primary subject. Lower level, near the escalator... - proceeding north. - Copy that. - Stay concealed until my go. - Copy. Can't see her yet. On our way. Careful, guys. Subject is armed. I see her. Stand by. When she reaches the center, verbals on my go. Go, go, go! All units... All units, tighten perimeter around lower concourse area near the market. We've got an active shooter! Civilians! Move!</i> Go! Go, go, go! Out of the way! Come on, move! Move! - No joy. - No joy. No joy. Boss, we've lost sight of her. Keep your eyes on the cameras.</i> Keep the exits tight. Wordy, where are you? I've got a subject, north of you. Hold still. Come on. - One in custody. - Wordy, good job. Lewis, get her up here fast. Sarge, we got a problem. We need to get everyone out where we can see them, but, uh, but they're spooked. You feel like talking down a crowd of about 500 over the P.A. system? - Yeah. Copy that. Help me out? - Yeah. Can I have your attention, please. Again, this is Sergeant Gregory Parker with the Strategic Response Unit. While I understand that you're frightened, I must insist on your immediate cooperation. Shopkeepers... We got to ditch the gun and get some clothes. - Where's Erin? - Shoppers, please... calmly walk to the central area and form a single line, and we'll let you out shortly. The police want everyone out now. Again, we thank you for your patience as we investigate this incident.</i> Please hurry! Anyone else here?! Okay, let's sweep and clear with extreme caution. Subject is armed and volatile. Kiddy Kidswear secure. Copy. 15-year-old girls. One day they're playing with Barbies, and the next, it's a semi. Better to be in the gang than to get beat up by the gang. Tall Girls, secure. Copy. 8:48 P.M.: Sergeant Parker interviews Erin Perretti. Here, take it. In your hands. You know her, right, Erin? What's her name? - Tasha Redford. - Tasha Redford. Thank you very much, Erin. She go to school? - Yeah, she goes to Junction Street. - Lewis, call Dr. Luria. Hello, Doc. We finally got a name on the primary subject: Tasha Redford, Junction Street High. Tough school. You got a home address for me yet?</i> Hold on. Sally, I need you to run that name, Tasha Redford. We're looking for an address. Copy. I want you to know you're being very cooperative, Erin, and I really appreciate that. We were just there in the bathroom, going about our business, you know? And then she comes in. Tasha's pulling out a gun. She's like a psychopath or something. She killed Cassaundra. Shot me in the arm, too. She did, huh? Mind if I take a look? I mean, Erin, you might need a bandage or something. Okay, Erin, now you're going to give us the names of all your friends. I'm assuming they're Winchester Crew, too, right? So take a look at the board here. You recognize anybody? - Brianna Tulley. - I didn't say that. So, now let's talk about what happened after you gave Tasha the haircut. These girls are tough as nails. They hold the guns, the drugs. Their boyfriend gets in trouble, they take the fall. So what, she moves up the ranks? Yeah, and maybe she doesn't have to do all those booty calls for all her boyfriend's buddies. Police. Come out now with your hands on your head. - Easy, I'm coming. I'm coming. - Out! Come on. Come on. All right, you guys go out with the others. After you put the cameras back. Bri, we gotta dump it. Michael got it from Dee-Mac. I lost a gun already. He'll kill me if I don't bring it back. I don't know you. Go sit down. Sit. My stores are clear. Headlines, boss? Girl with the haircut is Tasha Redford. These girls are all the same gang.</i> - Except for Tasha Redford. - That's not confirmed. - Initiation gone wrong? - That scene in the washroom... The girl's not a follower. She fought back. Maybe they're after her for something. Boss, I got Tasha Redford's name flagged on an attempted rape. Guy named Michael Donacosta, who is... - that guy. - Tasha went to the cops about that guy? Yeah. Well, I smell the revenge a mile away. Hey, Jules, you were right about Tasha. Good job. Redford house. Leave a message. Mom. Are you there? Mom? Pick up the phone. Please. Please. Pick up the phone. Okay. I love you. You're looking for Tasha's mom? Try the bar. Quite the welcome mat. I don't think so. Hands on your head. Turn around. Come on. That's it. Get this to forensics. Bag her hands for residue. - We didn't do nothin'. - You didn't do anything. Get 'em up to Parker. Okay, thanks, Doc. Single mom, drinking problem. Multiple calls to Family Services. Kid keeps her room tidy, but the rest of the place is a disaster. Well, that's good. She's trying to control her own space. Still has hope for the future. Tasha! I just killed a girl. Tasha, where are you? So... I just wanted to say... I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Tasha, where are you? - Thank you for being so nice to me. - I can help you. - I... I'll come get you. - Bye, Jackie. Tasha... There's a girl. She's in trouble. Police! Anybody still in here? Hey, team, listen up. Primary subject works in this mall. She was on shift at one of the kiosks earlier this evening. Copy, boss. Found the. 38. in the fitting room. She's gone. She probably knows this mall inside out. Tracking heat prints. Let's go. Step right up, ladies, right here. You know this guy, right? Michael Donacosta? Michael? Donacosta? There's no way I'll be able to fit. I'll find another way. Okay. Tasha's a good kid. She works hard. She's not in a gang. She's not doing drugs. She's trying to do it the right way, which is hard when you live where she lives. It's kids like that they should give medals to. - Jules, you get that? - Copy. Tasha, stop! - Stop, Tasha! - Get away from me! Get away from me! She's out on a ledge. Where are you? The media tower, level eight, the edge facing Young Street. Jules, we're on our way up. Jules, don't go face-to-face if she's armed. No visible weapon, just a girl and the pavement 200 feet below. Excuse me. Excuse me. There! - Everybody, move back. - Back it up. - Back! Back! - Back it up! Back it up! - Clear the area! - Everybody, back! - You up to intervention? - Copy. Okay, you're talking to a victim of an attempted rape.</i> She was brutalized in retaliation for going to the cops.</i> She's got no home support. But from what Luria says, she was holding on.</i> She was doing everything she could to keep her life together.</i> All right? And I'm here if you need me. Tasha. My name is Jules. Tasha. You don't have to talk to me, but I would really like it if you would. I'm not here to hurt you. I'm here to help. I'm gonna step closer so that you can hear me better. I'm stepping closer. Good. So... thanks for not jumping. Are you thinking you might? Well, I'm sorry to hear that. You know, I've never seen somebody who's ready to die put up such an awesome fight to stay alive. Yeah. Can you tell me what happened today? With those girls. Why don't you ask them? They gave you quite a haircut, didn't they? I thought they were gonna kill me. I know. I know. You were really scared, weren't you? They think I lied to the cops about Brianna's boyfriend... - about what he did to me. - But you didn't, did you? You didn't. - It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. - Tasha, it matters. It does matter. It was so brave what you did. You told the truth about what happened to you. You stood up to that guy. You fought back. Same with those girls. Come on, Tasha. Stay with me. Stay with me. I killed a girl today. That's negative. The girl's in surgery. She's doing fine.</i> No, you didn't. You didn't. You did not kill anyone. The doctors are fixing her right now. She's gonna be okay. Yeah. Come on, Tasha. Please. Will you give me your hand? Let's climb over. I can't. I can't. I can't. I'm dead anyway. Tasha, I know that it feels like that. I know, but you're not. It is. It's just how it is. I can't... I can't go to school. I can't go to work. I can't go home. For what?! My mom? I got nobody! I have nobody! You don't understand! You don't know how it is! - Okay, actually, Tasha... - Look at me! Look at me! I do understand. Actually, I do. I do, and that's why I'm standing right here. That's why I'm here. Okay? And I want you to take my hand, and I want to help you over. And you are gonna get through this. It might feel impossible, but you have the rest of your life, okay? And it's gonna be tough, but it's also gonna be really, really amazing. If you get through this, you can get through anything. I promise. Will you give me your hand? Give me your hand. Okay? Come on, Tasha. Come on. We're okay! - They're okay. She's okay. - Hang on. Jules caught her. We're gonna pull them up.</i> Let's get her up. - Hey! - Hey. Why did you do that for me? 'Cause I don't give up without a fight. Just like you. - I'm really sorry. - Don't be. Okay? These guys are gonna fix you up. - Okay? - Thanks. Hey, Jules... - Um, welcome. - Sorry. I knocked. - You use a curling iron? - Sam... I, uh, I just wanted to say... nice save out there. Didn't know you could fly. It was a... long four seconds before we knew you were okay. And I'm okay. Smashed hard against the side of that tower. And I'm okay. You want a second opinion? - How's it look? - Like a double bacon burger. - Thanks. - Anytime. So we're going to the diner for breakfast. You hungry? - You can bring, uh... what's his name? - Scott. Scott. If you want.
