We go through the skylight, we'll spook her. She might use the knife. What have I done?What have I done? Boss,I can see this. You're not seeing it. Sam's not seeing it. I can see it. We can be in there within three seconds. We'll disarm her. The knife is down. Repeat: the knife is down. We got to go in,boss. We got to risk it. - ******* - Go,go,go,go! {\a6}<i>3 hours earlier</i> Do****************** Just******** ********** ******* She********* Just*********** I'm***** No******** Maybe************ We********** Must************* Maybe********** *************** I'm************ Look******************** - It's************ - No.No. - So********** - No.************* We************** Sara********* 9************ ********* But************** Yeah****************** Last month, we sat here in this same spot, and I told you that your chances were very,very slim, and that I did not think that you should go forward with another treatment. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but in good conscience, I can't recommend that you spend another $15,000. Okay,all clear. Not that I don't appreciate a little excitement, but come on,I think we're safe. You mind if I don't gamble my career on what you think? Unless one of your neighbors works for the SRU, it's not much of a gamble. Now,headquarters, that's another story. I trust you have an entry plan. Affirmative. I'm gonna drop you off a few blocks away, park my vehicle at HQ, enter through the front. You're gonna wait a few minutes, stealth through the rear. - I was kidding. - Yeah,I'm not. Sarah,when you get home, can you see if I left my phone on the counter? We're not giving up,right? We're not... Oh,for God's sake,Sarah,we... - we're not doing it again. - Why? We're not doing it again. I'm sorry. I-I can't get back on this roller coaster. I can't keep feeling like every month is some sort of test that we have to pass... You know that's not true. What else do you want to throw away,hmm? I mean,what else gets thrown out the window just in case maybe this time we're lucky. What are you talking about,Josh? Everything that we save, sweetheart. Everything,everything that we hoped for. You're the one giving up on our hope. You threw away your work... which you were damn good at. And we agreed. We made that decision together. - Okay. - We agreed that that was the right thing to do. Because you wanted to relax. You wanted to relax and read catalogs and dream of babies in a house that we can't pay for anymore. I never said I wanted that house. I don't need a big house. We'll move. We'll get a smaller house. All our friends who have babies you don't want to see anymore. That's not true. You can't go outside because you're scared you're gonna see another frickin' stroller. I went outside yesterday. - Y-You went outside yesterday? - Yes. I've held your hand... I've stayed up with you at night. I've dreamed with you. I've given up a lot that I care about. I mean,I've done... everything that I can do, but I-I... I-I can't do this anymore. You can't do what? You know what? I-I should... I'm gonna go to work. I have to go to work. - What are you saying? - I have to go. - Josh! - Sarah. Josh! G... Josh. What are you saying? ********She keeps putting my pants in the dryer. Hold up. Hold up. Your mom still does your laundry? Hey,she's Italian,okay? Try and stop her. Gentlemen. Missed you at choir practice last night,man. That's another round you owe the boys. Don't let that add up. You know what? I lay down for 20 minutes, I opened my eyes, suddenly it was 6:00 a.m. I hate when that happens. Samtastic sleeping alone. What's this world coming to? Ed,we patrolling today? All right,listen up.

Anyway,who cares whate do? Uh,the sarge,the chief, the commander. The rules. - All right,but the thing is... - Yeah,yeah,yeah. It's nobody's business. We're professionals. Absolutely. You are utterly professional. Me,I'm just here for the sexy sniper chicks. You doing okay? Yeah. Yeah,I'm good. I'm good. 'Cause,uh,the other day at the station... Oh,come on. Here we go. - What? - Look,I'm just saying. You look through the scope, and you see things that aren't there. Maybe you need a break from the action. When was the last time you had a day off? I don't need a day off. Hey,we could all use a day off,Ed. All right, thanks,Oprah. I forgot what a joy it was to ride with you. Hello. - Mrs. Scott? - You must be Hannah. I'm,um... I write for... Wired Magazine. I'm here to see Joshua? Of course. Come in. - If this is a-a bad time,I could... - No. No,it's a good time. Please,come in. Sit down. You have a lovely home. Thank you.

I just want the truth. Okay. So you stay until we talk. Okay? All right. Okay,we can talk. - I'm calling the police! - Don't. No,don't! Put it down! Just stay... Just stay away from me. No. No,don't do that. - Oh,my God. Help me. - Put that down! -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly presents</font> -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> Flashpoint Season02 Episode02</font> Team One,gear up. Hot call. Possible home invasion, 16 Lakerock Crescent. We're real close. Boss? Kira,what did 54 Division give us? 911 came in ten minutes ago. Dispatch flagged it. There's been a wave of violent home invasions in the neighborhood. Underground Boys? Same grid. Copy that. Underground Boys? Four in the last two weeks, and all four came through the basement windows. Last week,they found some woman at home,tied her up and robbed the place. Kira,play the 911,would ya? Here it comes. Oh,my God! Help me,please! Help me,please! Help! Put that down! How far are you guys? Three minutes. Okay,don't approach without cover. They could be expecting us. Get some intel. Hold off on entry until we go in as a team. Got it. No signs of forced entry on black or white wall. Okay. No broken basement windows? That's a negative. Maybe the Underground Boys are trying a new MO. Could be something else. Who knows? Sarah and Josh Scott. She's an illustrator. Works from home. He runs a software design company. Neighbor saw them leave together early this morning, but she returned home alone around 9:15. That doesn't sound like a domestic,does it? Unless the guy came back and walked in on the wife doing something she didn't want him to see. Or she opened the door to the intruders herself. Sam,let's move forward on this. Make contact,but go careful. Yes,sir. Jules,I'm dialing in. Kira,can you patch me through to the source of the 911? Come on. This is Sam Braddock from the Police Strategic Response Unit. We're here to resolve the situation, but we can't help unless you pick up the phone. We got movement on white Alpha Two. Throw phone? Okay,team, it's not a domestic. The husband was at work, and he's on his way. Boss,we're thinking about a throw phone. If they pick it up, it will limit their movements. If they don't,we'll have the open mike on our side. All right,copy that. Here's something weird. I just talked to the alarm company. The alarm hasn't been triggered today, and it was armed a few minutes ago. So,what,the intruders come in and then she sets the alarm? How does that work? If someone's pointing a gun at you and they tell you to punch in the code,you'd do it. How far are we? Two minutes out. Please step away from your window. We are throwing a phone into the house. The window's going to break. What the hell was that? Please,please answer! - Please talk to them! - Shut up! Shut up! You don't get to tell me what to do! Don't tell me what to do! This is Sam Braddock from the Police Strategic Response Unit. Get away from my house! This is Sarah? Get down and stay down! Stay down! - Don't... don't move! - Okay! I just... I-I just want the truth! - Sarah! - Don't! Sarah! Just tell me the truth! Sarge,we lost the ear. She threw the phone out. It's escalating. Okay,we have a hostage situation with an unknown weapon. Talk is number one. But be ready with an immediate action if the hostage is threatened. Spike,you're less lethal. Jules,you're Sierra One. Let's set up the LADD. Number one on white, number two on black. At least we can keep listening. Copy that. Sam,I want you to say on the loudhailer. Be persistent with no pressure. You're not taking over? - Negative. - Copy that. Sarah,I'd really like to know... I don't know what you're talking about. I need to make sure everyone's okay in there,Sarah. Ed,I'm gonna run tactics. You and Lou run Command Post. Wha... Command Post? Oprah says. Yes,sir. Let's get a list of all the license plates parked nearby. - What? - You... in the truck. What can I tell you? It's backwards day. - Let me through. Get out of my way. - Sir... Get out of my way. My wife's in there. Let me through. Sarah! Let go of me! Joshua Scott. Mr. Scott. Thank you,Constable. What are you doing? We can't let you come any closer. My wife is in there. She's in danger. What are you doing? Sir,we're not sure it was your wife that placed the 911 call. What do you mean? We believe your wife is holding someone in there against their will. Sarah? No,Sarah would never do that. Sir,are there any firearms in the house? No,there's no firearms in the house. Stand back,sir,please. Team,husband claims there are no guns in the house. We might be looking at a knife, scissors, razor blade. Look,she would just never do that. - Sir,I can't have you do that. You need to step back. - Okay,okay. Now I need you to help me. I need you to help me with some answers,okay? What can you tell me about her state of mind this morning? She was upset. We had a fight,an argument. Your wife isn there with an unknown weapon and a hostage, and we don't want to make her more upset,okay? I don't think it's a good idea if she sees you through the window right now. - Okay. - You got to trust me on this. This is what we do. Okay. Okay,I want you to come into the truck over here. Talk to my guys, tell 'em what you know. ******Unknown weapon. *******Sarah Scott. Unidentified hostage. Sergeant Parker to direct tactical plan. How you doing? I'm Ed Lane. Louis Young. Have a seat, please,Josh. You texted him twice this morning. It's professional. I told you. You're lying. What about "Yesterday was amazing"? Any movement? No,but I definitely scared them away from the windows. A little aggressive,huh? You're doing good. Okay. Move as soon as we got a position on 'em. Copy. Gordy,we got ears yet? Getting an audio signal. - Please! - Tell me the truth! If we could just go outside,please? You can just talk to your husband. Please,let me talk to my wife. Josh,we can't right now. We can't. Spike's on Less Lethal. Boss gonna need you with the gas. What do you mean,"lethal"? Josh,Plan A is less lethal. Less lethal? Rubber bullets. How can you be less dead? We dislodge the weapon, restrain the subject. This is insane. You have all this hardware for an upset woman with maybe a knife. Knife's as bad as a gun. It never sticks,never jams, never runs out of ammo and you don't need traing to know how to use it. So just sit down and calm yourself. Please,please, I'm so scared! Please? I've got eyes. Female hostage. Knife confirmed. Threat imminent. - Spike,stand by. - Copy. On my go. Please don't hurt me! I'm pregnant! She's pregnant. Hostage is pregnant. Stand down! Stand down. Stand down. We got a pregnant hostage. You... you're having his baby? No. You're having his baby. Your having his... I knew it. I knew that there was a reason that,that... why he'd given up. It was you. Please,you're not making sense. You're coming with me. - Please,you need to talk to someone. - Get up! Okay,team,new rules: No Taser,no CS gas and no rubber bullets. Not a lot of tools in the toolkit. Gordy,we hear anything yet? Yeah,it's not clear. Please! Please! Go up the stairs. - They're wrestling. - Spike? I've lost them. I've lost visual. Boss,let me send in some gas, clear them out. Negative. She's pregnant. We got to go in,boss. We got to risk it. No! Enough! Please watch out for the baby! Enough! Enough,enough. Enough. Enough. Please,please don't hurt the baby. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Come on. Let's go. Upstairs. I need to show you something. So you have no idea who this woman is? No. Your wife thinks you're having an affair with her,Josh. I am,I am not having an affair. You understand the risk you're taking if you lie to me? I love my wife. We had a tough time, but I love my wife. I understand that, but what I don't understand is who she has in that room with her and why she has a knife to her throat. Mr. Scott, we need you to draw a floor plan of your house. Both floors,Josh. Every door-- which way it opens and every window. - Okay. - Thank you. Eddie,Eddie,what's he saying? That he's not involved with anyone. - You believe him? - No. Okay,she says she wants the truth,and so do I. He was saying they were having a fight this morning, talking about having a baby. Let's see how that escalated before this knife starts swinging again. Lou,I want you to patch me in on this conversation. I want Sam and I to hear it. Copy that. Sarah,it's Sam. I'm trying to phone again. Please pick up. Did he tell you about this? What? About the eight years? I don't know. I don't know what you're saying. Shut up! Over there. Get over there. Sit down! I interviewed him for the conference in New York forWiredmagazine. We had tea. That's what I meant by "yesterday was amazing." - You're lying. - The interview... The interview was amazing. Sarah,I need you to come to the phone so we can talk about your safety. - What did you just do? - Nothing. - What did you just do? - Nothing. We've been trying to have a baby for eight years. Eight years of hormone shots, IVF treatments. We took out loans. We drained the accounts. It looks like we can afford it,right? But we couldn't. A year ago we get pregnant, finally. But we didn't want to tell anyone because we wanted to be sure. So we waited-- one month,two months,three... At four months,we made this... we made this room for the baby. We let ourselves believe. We told everyone. And we lost it. How'd she handle it? She fought back. She's a fighter. I didn't want to give up. For him. He should be a father. Is she delusional? Mentally unstable? No. No,I mean she... she was depressed for a while, but she's not deluded. Then tell me why she thinks you're having an affair with a total stranger,Josh? Boss,we're picking up some kind of audio signal. What kind of audio signal? From the house, intercom maybe. Patch it in. - Josh,you guys have an intercom at your house? - No. Walkie-talkies, anything? We're picking up voices here. I mean,we have a baby monitor, but it wouldn't be on. Where? - In the nursery. - What floor? It's on the second floor, front of the house. Can you get it any clearer,Lou? I'm working on it. Okay,team, we know we're not welcome here, so let's go stealth, low and slow. Spike and Wordy, I want you on entry with me. Jules. My cousin has a baby monitor. It's a two-way, so the kid can hear the parents. It's worth a try. Okay,try to tap into that frequency. Sam,she's not going to answer that phone. We'll try this way in. Jules,I want you to find a scorpio position on the roof. I think I saw a skylight up there. That'll be Plan B. And bring a camera pole. I just need to get through this without you trying something again. Okay? Okay,we got ears, and we're good to talk anytime you say,Sam. Channel 4. Good work,Lou. I'm gonna need you on entry with me, and get the husband's keys. If you want to get out of here alive, then you're going to tell me what happened in New York. You're going to tell me why you were there with him. What happened after tea? Nothing. What was so amazing then,hmm? What do you want me to say? Huh,what do you want? I lose either way,right? What kind of answer do you expect when you wave a knife in someone's face? I will know the truth when I hear it. You're not going to like the truth. Go,Kira. License plates coming at you. All right, let's see what we got. Josh,you recognize any of these? Hannah Murray. Oh,my God. She rented a car that's parked down the street. You know her? She's a reporter from New York. How do you know her? Why would she... I haven't seen her since... Since when, Josh,since when? Are you telling me that you had a thing with this woman? We got to know,buddy, 'cause if you did, that changes everything. I did. I've known Josh for 18 years. Before Sarah, we were friends,really close, but never more than friends. From the first moment we met, we had a connection, you know,like... a really strong connection like... the ones you can't really explain. And we lost touch, and then one day, I'm in New York in a conference, and we bump into each other and sh... she asked me if she could interview me. Then I'm talking to him face to face after all these years, and it's like no time has passed. Sarah and I were in this really bad place. I mean,I don't want blame it on fertility treatments,but... He said somewhere in there it was like you two stopped having anything to say to each other. Every conversation was about: when's the next doctor's appointment, what are the odds, how,how are we going to afford to pay for the next treatment? And,you know,I-I don't want to sound like I'm making excuses. I-I don't want to make ex... oh,my God. Josh was still Josh, but he'd changed. I could see that. He was sadder, like the life had gone out of him. like... like he'd forgotten how to laugh. And you,you laughed. Afterwards, I'm lying next to her, and all I can think about is Sarah, and I'm thinking to myself, "What have I done?" Spike,what's going on? I need eyes in. Barricaded? Sarah saw my father through three rounds of chemo. You know, she was there in the hospital with me when my father died. Oh,my God. That one night was the biggest mistake of my life. It was the night that was always meant to be. It was just 15 years late. That night... Oh,my God, he came alive again. All right,I'm in position. No joy yet-- I'm going to try the camera pole. Spike, get up there with Jules. Sam,Sam, this is our last chance. Unless you got something to go on, I got to send Jules in on an explosive entry. No,hold on the entry. Patch me into the room. Let me give it a shot. I couldn't tell Sarah, I just... I couldn't. You know,and when I got back, when I got back,every time I looked at her, I just... I loved her more, and I was so scared that I was going to lose her, you know,and that just, that just changed everything. It changed everything. What have I done? What have I done? Josh,you told us the truth. You did the right thing. *********** Yeah. It's on channel 4. - The baby... - Yeah. Is Josh the father? Sarah? It's Sam,Sarah. We were able to open a frequency on that monitor in your room. They're talking about sending a team in there. I don't want to send anyone in. I want you to come out,Sarah. Oh,God... It's you. That's why he gave up so easily. 'Cause... he wants to be with you. And the baby. Sarah,please,I need you to listen to me. You know what he promised me? He promised me... no matter what, through thick and thin, we'd be together. Is that what she's saying? That's what she's saying? And I don't think any of that's changed,Sarah. No,no,no. No,because when he got back from New York, he was changed. He was different. Like he was trying too hard. when the doctor told us to stop trying, I couldn't stop crying. He didn't cry. Not once. Tell her I did. I... I just... it was just... just never in front of her, 'cause I wanted to be strong for her,I wanted... I wanted to be strong for... Look,just t-tell her I'm here. Tell her that I... that I love her. T-Tell her about the Bridge of Sighs. Tell her about the Bridge of Sighs. Boss,you get that entry option lined up, you've got to go for it. No,Ed,hold it. Give the husband a headset. Mr. Scott? This is Sam Braddock; I'm the guy talking to your wife. Tell me about the Bridge of Sighs. I got eyes. Tell me. Knife is pointed down. What's the subject's state? She's crying,distracted. Boss,threat is low. I can do this. I can see access. Alpha One and Two,requesting permission to enter,sir. We go through the skylight, we'll spook her. She might use the knife. Sir,she does not want to use that knife. Do you know that? This isn't aggression anymore. This is grief. She's almost done. She just wants the truth. Boss,I can see this. You're not seeing it. Sam's not seeing it. I can see it. We can be in there within three seconds. We'll disarm her. The knife is down. Repeat: the knife is down. The truth is the only thing she's been asking for, her one demand, and she's not getting it. Okay. Okay,the knife is still in her hand. Constable Braddock will continue with negotiation. Sarah? Do you know what? I'm really not that great with words,but... but I've been talking to a guy who is. And he's been telling me a lot about you. About how he made a big mistake, about how much he loves you... That's not true! And he wanted me to tell you... about the Bridge of Sighs. When my father died... And when his father died and he'd lost his job, you bought two tickets to Venice, and you said you'd walk over the Bridge of Sighs together. Yeah. To gain perspective. When you've been through so many... losses together... you're connected, you belong to each other. Always. Sarah,Josh loves you. It's taking about six of us to stop him from rushing in there,Sarah. You want the truth? This is it: he loves you. Subject is down. Hostage has weapon. Go,go,go,go! Move away from the door! Move away from the door! Down! Stay down! Put your hands where I can see them! - Stay down! - Stay on the ground. Stay on the ground. Keep your hands where I can see them. Eddie,paramedics,right away. Hey,buddy, what's her status? Unstable. Knife hit a major vessel. Massive blood loss. Sarah... Oh,my God. Is she gonna be all right? We'll take care of her. There. We'll get you in an ambulance. They'll take a look at you. Okaycome on. Sarah,Sarah... the hospital where the doc will take a look at you. This didn't have to happen. This did not have to happen. There are always variables that we can't anticipate. But,Sarge, we could've saved them both. There's no way we could know. "11:06 a.m.Callaghan: Boss,threat is low. "I can do this. I see access. "Braddock: She wants the truth. She's responding. Give me a shot." It was a risk either way. Blah,blah,blah, blah,blah,blah. "11:09 a.m. "Alpha One and Two, "explosive entry through Black Charlie Three." I had a connection. She did not need to be subdued by force. "Subject was lying prone on the floor, a knife wound to the chest." We know,Jules. We were there. "11:17. Subject in critical condition. Taken to hospital." We were there. I had eyes in. There was time to get in. The knife was down. And then the hostage escalated. Which she wouldn't have if we'd already gone in. Sam,you were the negotiator. It's your right to call it how you see it. We can't second-guess whether an earlier tactical response might have had a different outcome. Due respect,sir,but it came down to talk or tactics, and you're the one that called talk. That's right. Because maybe that's the call a negotiator would make. Look,I'm just saying, all right? I want to know what Ed would have done. It was the sarge's call! I want to know,too. Sometimes you do everything right. Things still go wrong. That's the job. Situation was gray. The boss made a black-and-white call. We saved the hostage. Period. Uh,sorry. The hospital just called. Sarah Scott. Doctors got her stabilized. She's gonna be all right. - That's great,Kira. Thanks for letting us know. - Okay. Okay,then. That's good. Right? - Need to talk. - Take a number. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey,Eddie. I'm sorry. Today should have gone better. You need to be back where you belong. Team needs you back. I'm thinking,I'm-I'm gonna get Soph,I'm gonna get Clark. We're gonna go up and get a cottage,you know? Regroup,like you... Like you said. That's great. That's great. You know,unless,uh, you feel useless or something without me. Decent. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have jumped on you like that. No,it's okay. I get it. We all wanted them out safe. What? I don't know if we should do this. Sneaking around on the team. We put our lives in each other's hands,and... Yeah,and you're thinking we should take a break. I don't know. I don't know what I'm thinking. Me,neither. Okay,so,take a break tonight? Give us time to think? Or we could think while priming my drywall. That's not fair. You know how much I love priming drywall. Yeah,almost as much as you love my protein-mango breakfast smoothies. Don't do this to me. I'm just saying.
