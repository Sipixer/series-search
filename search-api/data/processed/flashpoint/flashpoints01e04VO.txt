Anything that helps me get closer to shelly and my girls, I'm there. If this is what they're watching, I wanna know about it. Got no secrets. I think you need to shoot something. Well, after you, siskel. You're the one that recognized the quote. - Oh, yeah. - Ohhh, snap! Hey, you know what, it's on friggin' pay-per-view, every hour on the hour, all right?

Kid waited for him after school and... what're you gonna do? Well, what are you gonna do? I dunno. You know, soph wants to... "we'll go to the school and we'll take to him." So go to the school about it, find out what's going on. Nah. I mean, it'll just make it worse. Clark needs to stand up on his own... his own two feet. He's 13-years-old. Exactly. Well no wonder he doesn't wanna talk to you about it. You know what, wordy, you got three girls, okay? So... oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Three girls, a real walk in the park, they never do anything wrong.

Well, tell me how it ends then? Tell me. We both know how it ends. I call the cops, they show up, he's got a fat lip because I fought back, he tells them I'm crazy, and they turn out to be buddies from 58 division. So you leave! Where is he, sadie? Please. You can'T. If he finds out that you know about this, any of this, he's gonna kill me, or you, or... oh, just... just leave! I don't know. I just don't know anymore. this is going to end. I get it. You can't do it. I just need to sleep. Okay, everything's fine, just go to sleep. I'll give caitlin a bottle. Rebecca? I'm sorry.

Well, my partner in narcotics, pete fitzhaven, his wife just called, her name's sadie. I'm stuck in court on a heroin case, she needs a little help on the qt. I don't know who else to ask. What do you need? I don't know yet. There's um... there's a little bit of trouble over there. Pete's gun's missing, she can't track him down. All right, where is she? You sure you're okay to stop by? You know, I figure if there's a firearm involved, you guys might get called anyway. Better if it's you, right? Yeah, yeah. We're just on patrol, it's no problem. Gimme her twenty, we'll be there in five. See? It's nice to turn your phone off once in a while. It's old school. No one can find you, no one knows where you are. Hey, how'd it go with the review board? You get bumped up? I did. No way. Congratulations, sergeant. Hey, mickey, we need another round here. You got it. You, uh... you still playing with that thing? 'Cause it kind of looks like your boys wanna finish their game. I don't know. It's up to you, I guess. Pete, it's nice to see you. It's good to catch up, you know? All right, I'll be back. Finish that drink. just soda from now on, okay, mickey? - You sure? - Yeah. I don't want to make him feel bad, but it's a little early for me. Check out the window. Sadie fitzhaven? Hey, I'm ed. This is kevin. We, uh... we got a call from matt mcdondrick. Oh god. he said he'd send a friend, he didn't need to call the sru. No, it's all right, we're friends. We're uh, we're just on patrol, it's nothing official. Do you mind if I just... - not at all. - Fine. Do you want to tell us what's going on? My sister came by. She was upset, she was very emotional. Your sister. And you didn't let her in? Well, I was upstairs, I was with the baby. I was nursing, so I didn't get the door. I guess she just figured I was here. So what'd she want? - To talk to pete. - Talk to pete? Did you tell her where he was? Oh, I didn't have to. Chances are if pete's not here then he's at the lion. Look, I was upstairs, you know, in the baby's room, and she was storming around for a while and then she left. With your husband's gun. And you're sure he didn't have it with him? No, I saw him put it in the closet. He's very particular - one place; that's where it goes. Look, I'm sure that everything's fine. You know, and I wish that matt hadn't called you. You know, I just wanted to make sure that... No way. I agree. Pete's voicemail. She's leaving stuff out. She's leaving all the good stuff out. Maybe she doesn't know any good stuff. - Matty, it's ed. - You talk to her? - We did. - And? I don't know. There's something going on. There's A... there's a broken door, there's a missing gun. Who broke the door? Her sister, rebecca kessfield. That ring any bells? You sure it was rebecca? What's the story, matt? Off the record, she's been stalking the guy. She's been obsessed about him for months. She's out of her sweet mind. Pete's told me crazy stuff, stuff he hasn't even told sadie. I'm out. What? Where are ya going? You're bailing on our game. Ah, guys, I'm calling it a day. Got a baby at home. told ya I wasn't leaving. Just didn't want anybody talking. Pete, why don't I just drive you home. It's been a long day. I'm fine. Come on, you've had a few. Hey, if you wanna walk home, that's cool, but I'm good to go. Okay, I guess I'll walk. You know, it was uh, it was good to see you. Where's your car? I didn't drive. You want a lift? - Sure. - I don't mind at all. Are you okay? I'm fine. you're such a lightweight. - oh yeah? - Yeah. I could, uh... I could do another drink, you know. I'm not scared. what about the patio at o'malley's? It's a beautiful sunset. Well, we could, uh... we could go to your boat. guys, this may be nothing, but we have a potential incident involving a police officer and a missing firearm at the lion bar. Copy that. I've got nothing goin' on, I'll meet you there. South street and beacon. - Bravo, charlie? - Copy. You guys stay put, we'll call you if we need you. This way. it's just up here on the left. Careful, don't fall in. I did that once. In venice. Came out of this restaurant, a couple glasses of wine, thought it was the reflection of the street or something, I stepped right in and... bam, I'm in the canal. You know, there's no... no fences or anything. Aw, man, you are lucky. I wish I had a chance to, you know... to what? Travel! See the world! Get drunk. Help pretty ladies out of the water. Well... here we are. uh, yeah, they were talking at the bar, but, uh, she said goodbye, left without him, everything seemed fine to me. She really wasn't even drinking. She had one drink and then after that it was soda water. Hey, eddie. Rebecca kessfield's clean. No priors, no tickets, no nothing. - What about the wife? - Haven't checked yet. - Eddie, any news? - Nothing. Guys, this woman's out of her mind. Yeah, but so's his wife. The whole family, I mean, I feel bad for the guy, I do. Ed. Three weeks ago... pete said rebecca showed up at the office. You know, sat outside in her car for an hour waiting for him to come out. Apparently, he didn't return her call. Matty, they having a thing here or what? I don't know. Not my place. Sorry. Maybe. The wife's sister? Boss. Hold on a second. I don't know for sure, okay, but there was something there. I guess I figured maybe they had had a thing, he ended it - obvious reasons - she was pissed off, confused, I don't know. Don't ask, don't tell. Got a little domestic situation on our hands? And he's hammered. She's got a gun. I hear you. Hey, frank, where's he going? Uh, I don't know, he said he's going home. Well, he's not at home. Anyone? He's got a boat. Let's start with the boat. team one, let's gear up. Thanks. You could've. Coulda what? Gone to italy. You know, this, uh... this boat alone would've bought you a couple of trips, there and back, you and sadie. Nah, I need this. It's good to have a place to go, you know? Get away. There we are. Sit down, relax. Sunset, right? Don't want to miss it. Let me just uh... - pull this back so we get a better view. - No, uh... it's kinda nice. It's cozy, you know? Security guard said that he pulled in in a blue pickup with a blonde passenger. It's gotta be them. Let's check with matt, see if he knows which slip he's in. So, are you seeing anyone? Not right now. All the good ones are taken, right? Anyway, I'm not really sure I'm cut out for the marriage thing. Ksloo pretty hard. Oh, come on. No sex, no fun, no sleep, no slack... what's not to like? So why do you stay? I don't know. Looking for somethin' better to come along, I guess. You know? Matty, are you sure about this? I was here two weeks ago, he's moored in 127. That's it. Okay, well, parallel to the end of the dock, that's not good. - No, it's harder to contain. - Contain? Well, that's what we're starting with. We want all our options, and that's the only way out? Yeah, on foot. Sergeant, just walk your guys down to the boat. No. We don't wanna spook the girl with the gun, right? If they don't see us, we control what happens. Sam, we need to find a high point, parallel and east of this guy right here. So, let me know when you got eyes on him. Yes, sir. All right, the rest of us, we're gonna go stealth 'til I hear something different. Jules, get matty into the command truck. I want priors on the wife. I want priors on the husband. Priors on the husband? Sergeant, this way. Wordy. We need to get sadie fitzhaven down here. What, the wife? Why? Because she was lying. - Okay, I... - won't let her past the truck. All right, good. 'Cause I don't want her anywhere near this thing. Copy that. Lewis! Spike! Let's hit it. We used to be good. Things were good for the first couple years. It's, it's complicated. Used to be us against the world. then she had caitlin and... the day she was born, sadie's all grumpy, she's on the edge. That baby doesn't stop crying. You know, she's five-months-old. Sir! Let's go, let's go. Let's hustle it up. 7:57 pm, team one on the scene of a possible domestic, marina quay west. 35 foot cabin cruiser, registered under one peter fitzhaven, currently docked in slip number 127. My job takes it out of me, I haven't had sex with my wife in six months. I'm sitting next to a girl and uh... well, I chose the wrong one. They're either in the cockpit or they're in the cabin. Lewis, see if you can get eyes from down here. Sarge, what if nothing's happening? What if he's in there all alone? I hope so. False alarm's my favourite kind of alarm. Spike, see if this guy'll let you use his shortwave. Maybe we can contact him through that. Yeah, it'll work if pete's radio's on. Okay, I'll check it out. Lewis? There's plastic all around the front, I can't see anything. If I got near the actual dock, maybe. No, back off. I don't want her spottin' you. - Hello there. - Hello. I need to use your radio. So leave... yifou're unhappy. - Maybe I will. - Maybe you should. Hey, don't tell me what to do. I'm not, I'm just... pete, it's not a secret, you know? You married my little sister at this very marina, what? Three years ago? - When's the first time you hit her? - Excuse me? I'm guessing about five months later, I'm thinking maybe it was that first halloween? She got dressed up for a party - sexy nurse. - I remember you didn't like it much. - You know what? You... took me a little while to figure it out, but I did. - She doesn't have the energy to lie to me anymore. - No? Because she's pretty good at it. nothing. Thanks. We had a few fights, we had a kid, she got fat, we had a few more fights! - She's my wife! - She's your prisoner! don't you laugh! Don't you dare laugh! I think it's time that you left. Sam, we don't have eyes yet. You? Almost there. You know what? How come you haven't left yet? Guys, I got 'em. Where are they, middle, stern or bow? Standing in the back, they're under a tarp. It's not like she's asking for the moon. You know? It's not like she's asking for flowers, or diamonds, or trips to italy... she's just asking you to be nice. Thing is, you can't do it! You can't do it, pete, 'cause it's not in your nature. You're gonna leave, tonight. Okay, you're gonna go to a friend's place, she's gonna get a lawyer, - and you're never gonna see her again. - Rebecca. Say thatyou'll do it. Just say that you'll do it! - Give me my gun back. - Say it! - Go to hell. - Say it again. She's got a gun. She's got it pointed at his head. Either way this is gonna be over. Today, it's gonna be over, it's gonna be done. She's moving in, she's on him. Ed, shright in his face. Rebecca kessfield, this is the police strategic response unit. We have got everything under control out here. How's everything over there? Get back! Rebecca, my name is greg, and I wanna help you. Undo that rope. Pete, undo the rope! We're concerned about your safety, so, if you could tell me what this is all about, we can all go home. - Do you got a cellphone? - Do it! Maybe you can turn it on and we can start talkog abinut this. That's pete. He's cuttin' the boat loose. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Get back. Get back, pete. Go inside. - Go inside! - Rebecca, please. - Go! - Relax! Looks like they're going inside. Okay, easy. We can't help you this way. You have to stay calm, you have stay there and you have to talk to us. They're inside the cabin. Inside the cabin? Buddy, they're floating away. Maybe it's good, you know. Maybe they'll finally... maybe they'll finally listen. Except you probably... you probably set me up, right? Your guys probably think I'm crazy, huh? Sergeant, we do not need you out there. Now I need you tell us everything you can about pete fitzhaven. If we can't figure out why we're here, we can't start talking. Good. Go lethal. Please, I told you everything already. - Jules, can you take over? - Yeah. In the truck. The wife's here. Luria's stuck in a parole hearing, she's gonna keep us posted. Sadie, hi. I'm kevin wordsworth, we met at your place. I'm sorry, I had to drop caitlin off at the neighbour'S. What's happened? Well, nothing's happened. We're just trying to make contact with rebecca, with your husband. We're working on it, okay? But, sadie, right now, I really need your help. We need to understand what's going on here. If you want us to get your husband home to you, safe and sound tonight, you need to tell me what rebecca wants. You good to keep talking? If I can get her on the phone.

I will never see her again if that's what she wants, okay? - Rebecca, can you hear me? - Bec... it's me, it's not her. You remind me of this girl. A girl from my neighborhood, growing up. She was smart, she was funny, she was... beautiful. And then she got married - real young - to this guy who beat the crap out of her. Both phones are off. All right, keep dialing. Hey, jules, jules... get luria, find out what this guy means to her. Maybe she has a past psych history, anything you got. I'm on it. The thing about shelley was, well, she's such A... a tough cookie. But it took us... I don't know, two years... to figure it out. Two years... before I realized why she wore turtlenecks in the summer; before I figured out why she's always looking so scared. Two years before I could help her get out of that marriage; before anyone could help her get away. And you know what? If I'd been given half a chance, I would've killed him. Ike, what do ya hear? Nothing. Water. Very loud water. Ed, what do you wanna do? I wanna go in there. I wanna get ears on that boat, or I wanna gas them. Sam? Six rounds of cs, ready to roll.

Not yet, but wordy's with her right now. Sadie, we're preparing a lethal solution for your sister. If you can think of anything that might help us, anything... I told her to leave me alone. I didn't want her in the middle of this. she hates me for not leaving him. it is not your fault, it's his fault. Take care of her. It's his fault! Look, just... just don't hurt her please! self-defense. It's a cop's best friend. Dude, can't swim in your gear. Sam, I know it's a little unorthodox; no time for a wet suit. You good to go?
