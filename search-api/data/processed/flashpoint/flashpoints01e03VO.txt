This is sergeant greg parker with the police strategic response unit. Am I speaking with sean keenan? Yes you are. How can I help you, greg? You want to tell me what's going on here today? Why, greg? What's on your mind, hmm? Option a: We let the boss talk him out. Option b: We try to isolate keenan, maybe we got a shot at a clean rescue. What about immediate entry? Wordy, hold off. Well, sean, a firearm was discharged in your vicinity - in your area, in your neighbourhood - and we were just wondering if everyone in there was all right. We're great. Thank you very much for asking. And how 'bout you, greg? How you doin'? hurry up! You know what, sean, let's cut the pleasantries and get to the point, okay? We both know why my team and i are here, right? Yeah? Well, why don't you tell me all about it. Thanks, sally. - Weapon keenan's carrying is called a "jury". - A jury? It's a street name. It's new. It takes five rounds - shotgun and single bore. - Explains the size of the wound. - Yeah. - Hey, man, hang on - Easy, easy, easy. You're gonna be okay, all right. - You gotta- you should get out. - You know how I remember you? At the green grouse, it was you who arrested me. - sorry. - No-no-no, man, don't be sorry. Turned my life around. Kid... go on, get out. We got a guy dying in there. He's in the line of fire. And we also have an unknown who's in the line of fire. What are we saving cops or we saving drug dealers? Don't let it get personal, wordy. I'm just saying. He had the gun pointed at the kid. - Lover's quarrel. - Body language. Haircut, nice clothes, it just doesn't add up. We do an explosive entry, flashbangs... Keenan still has time to fire his weapon. He's right. We got more than one life here. I'm not putting this kid at risk. I don't give a flying king-sized crap what you do for a living. I've got a friend in there and I want to get him out alive. You're a smart guy, I expect you're fully familiar with how to use a toilet. Hey, you've done this before. I got nothing but the best and brightest for you, sean. Very important to us, so... if we can both handle this professionally, the boys and I won't have to come in there and trouble you at all. So you do what you gotta do. go on, get out. No, man, we're both gettin' outta here. Can't do it. 'Cause there's only a couple of ways this can go, right? We're not looking for more people to get hurt. This guy's on his third strike. It's gonna be all about the blaze of glory. How's geddes doing? He's hanging in there. - I don't know how much longer. - Options. We're not coming up with any other choices, boss. We go through the window? And he'll use you as target practice. No. All right. Thanks, sal. Okay. Our unknown is jackson barcliffe, 21, a former client of keenan'S. He was arrested 8 months ago for possession. His parole officer says that he's been on the wagon ever since. On the wagon until today, I guess. Sean, we can resolve this, peacefully, right now, if you make the right choice. Place your weapon on the floor and you come out your door... okay, greg, I hear ya. I just need to think over my options over here. well, you do. You think about those options, but you think about them very carefully because you're already apprehended, right? That's a given. - What about the kid? - Come on, he's made his choice. - How's he doing? - He's still breathing. If you want to make things better for your future, you should think about showing us that you can make the right choice. Running out of time, ed. yeah? It's the kid in the room. Jackson. My name's ed, I'm a police officer with the sru. I want to help. Okay, okay, let's talk. Jackson, you did the right thing calling. The man who's shot, how's he doing? Uh, there's A... there's lot of blood, he's bleeding pretty bad. Okay, is he breathing? Yeah-yeah-yeah, he's breathing. Okay, his name's harlan. Now I need you to do me a favour, jackson. I need you to move your finger back and forth in front of his eyes. No, no, he's conscious, he's fine. Okay, that's good. That's good. Look, um, I can't talk long, if sean comes in... if he comes back, jackson, just put the phone down. Okay, just put the phone down, but leave it on, all right? That way we can hear you. You make the smart choice and that sends a positive message. this is all my fault. This shouldn't have happened, I just... I just... take it easy, jackson- I, I need the money.I swear to god I was clean. I'm clean now. Jackson, that's amazing. Are you doing the steps? Yeah, yeah. Eight months. That's incredible. That's incredible. That shows me that you got a lot of strength; that you can do this. All right, you wanna help? I need you to wrap that towel tight against his stomach. Okay, he's still bleeding, you gotta slow that down. Okay, we gotta get in there. We gotta get in there and do our job. I don't wanna see you get hurt, so I need you to get out. No-no-no, I'm not leaving. This is my fault. Nope, we've got an ambulance on the way. It's my fault. I'm not leaving. Okay. Take a look at the door. Do you see anything unusual? Any boobytraps? Any wires around the frame, around the door handle, any... No, no, it's two locks and a bolt. Good. Okay, that's good news. Okay, here's the thing, if we come in now, jackson, you and geddes are right in the line of fire. Okay, so what I'm gonna ask you to do is move him to the other room. Oh, god, I can try. Jackson? Jackson? Well, you know, greg, I, uh... I appreciate the approach you're taking here. You sound like A... reasonable man. Well, greg, you know, uh... I respect your point of view. I do. Yeah. 'kay, man, I'm gonna try and move you, okay? All right, ready? Come on. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You know, I'd like to deal with someone... - my name is harlan. - What? My name is harlan geddes. Please... tell my wife... I, I love her. we're losing him. The kid's putting himself on the line here. No, we got an officer on the line here. Careful. Tell my boys... that I'm proud of them. And I love 'em, okay? Eddie... you're gonna be fine, okay, man? It's all right. I just... I just gotta move you, okay? I'm sorry, it's gonna hurt. Okay. Bravo team, gear up for rappel descent.

Looks like geddes is gonna make it. Too bad about the kid. How else was it gonna end? I don't know. I don't know, but that is not your call! And maybe I was wrong, sam. Maybe. But I need to know that my team is on my side. - Then treat me like I'm on your team. - What? You wanna know what happened in afghanistan? Is that what this is about? I was taking out targets in a stronghold, 1500 metres away. The reccy was done, I was cleared to fire. We went down to do the id's, one of them was my buddy matt. I was sniping with a . 50 cal. He shouldn't have been there, I was cleared to fire. You just had to ask. You go in on my command.
