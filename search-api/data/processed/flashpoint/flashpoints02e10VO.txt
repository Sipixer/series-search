We've just intercepted that cell phone call. Go ahead,lou. Justin,please. Don't let mike give up! They say they'll hurt me and the baby. Man,that was crazy. You son of a bitch!You were going to give up! What are you talking about? You got us into this and you were just going to bail?! - Jus... - they're going to kill maya and the baby. What do you mean "baby"? - What baby?! - What baby?Maya's pregnant? How could you do this to me,mike? - Jus,I... - how could you possibly do this to me?! I didn't know,jus.I'm sorry,okay?Justin,I'm sorry! You're always sorry! And you always call me  to bail you out! Yeah,I do. I make mistakes,okay? I know I do. I make lots of mistakes!I know! I'm sorry I didn't have the luck to be born like you with the luck that you have! What else do you want me to say? The next time you screw up,call someone else. There is no one else. You know that. Let's,uh... let's just get the codes and do this. So anything you can come up with would be really helpful. Did they seem to be familiar with one another? 5:33 P.M.12 hostages secured.To subjects still armed and active. A mike mckewon and an employee identified by his manager-- justin fraser. Justin,please... don't let mike give up! -This is livideo nk they just sent justin. -They said they'd hurt me and the baby. okay,new deal,ed. These guys are acting under duress. Someone's holding the employee's wife. Colleagues say she's seven months pregnant. It also sounds like they seem to know each other,boss. If they know each other,what's their connection? Lewis,did you track the source? Yeah,prepaid cell,no gps. Manager said they were trying to wire money into an offshore account,but they didn't have the right codes. They still think they can do it. And that's why they won't give up. If someone had sophie,would you? Winnie,mike mckewon and justin fraser. We need a connection.See who could be pulling their strings and from where asap. Copy. Boss,whoever it is,I think they're watching. That's what justin was doing. He uplinked the security system to an ftp. If you give someone the web address they can see what we see. The guy's pretty good. Want me to interrupt the feed,block the bad guy's view? Negative. Ed,this is why justin told us not to interfere. The kidnapper will keep the wife alive as long as he thinks he'll still get his money. I want to believe the wife's still alive. And we can use this to our advantage. So we keep them in the game till we figure out where they are? -Yeah. -All right. Sarge,uniforms confirm no sign of maya fraser at the house. And they report signs of forced entry. Thanks,winnie. I got a hit on your guy justin fraser. -In crimal record? -No,family services. Go ahead. Okay,both parents deceased.Looks like he was 13. He was transferred to the custody of a jack fraser. Uncle,in brampton. Okay,let's get ahold of the uncle. See if he can tell us what justin's got himself involved in. You got it. So how are you going to find these codes we need? The override codes change every few weeks,so the execs have go w toherite tm down somewhere. Mike: What are we looking for? It's,uh,it's usually something personal. Like A... like a birthda or a cat? Justin's a good kid. Smart. My brother's son.He came to live with me after he lost his parents. So what happened to the parents? Uh... car accident. As far as you know,justin isn't involved in illegal activities? Well,he studied his butt off to get where he is,maya's expecting-- no,I... I don't see him throwing that away. Well,are they okay? What do you know about mike mckewon? Oh,so this is about mike. No. Look,I had three kids of my own,okay? I couldn't take them both. Besides,he was 17.He was old enough to be on his own. So you're saying justin and mike are brothers? No,no,half. His mom remarried my brother when mike was two or three. Then they had justin. But the kid's always been trouble. Not even my brother could handle him.There was no way I could take that on. So after the accident,justin got a home,and mike was left to look out for himself? Yeah. Are you in? yeah. How'd you know the name of the cat? I didn'T. The password is on the back. ******* okay,all right,it's scanning the system for the codes now. Once we get them,we take them down to the secure servers in the basement,input them,send the cash. Then they let maya go. How long has maya been pregnant? Seven months. You got a boy or a girl? We don't know,mike.We were going to wait. I'm sorry. I've been working on the video attachment for mike's phone. Justin... please. They want their money by 6:00 or they say they'll... they'll kill me. you hear that?Sirens. Sounds like a cruiser. -They want their money by 6:00... -and an ambulance. -...Or they say they'll kill... -the message was sent at 5:01 P.M. I got winnie to send me the info on all cruiser and ambulance calls at 5:01. Three cruisers,one ambulance. Say she's downtown. She could either be here,here or here-- wellington and john. -Club district. -Exactly. -Nice work,spike. -And here,there's more. We've got a corner of a window. Arched window,stained glas it could be a church. No,not at wellington and john. No,no,no,that's the viper-- a night club. I did a drug case in there. You sure about this? Yeah,that makes sense.I mean,most of the ubs in that area are hot with drug traffic. Mostly gang controlled. A gang would have what it takes to pull this off? That is the viper.I know the windows. Club's five minutes from here. Okay,winnie,let's deploy team four to viper nightclub. No,sorry.Team four was dispatched 20 minutes ago,sarge. Domestic gun call in rexdale. I'll put team three on standby. It'll take them at least half an hour just to deploy. All right,we can be there in five. Our hands are tied here.Besides,the threat's at the club. Okay,you go.Lou,spike and I will alpha here. Lewis,call guns and gangs.See if anything flags. Copy that. All right,the rest of us bravo at the club.Fast is good.We got a 6:00 deadline. Let's stay off the news. wait... I got it. boss,got a call going out. Yeah. Okay,we've got them-- the override codes to get into the system. Now you're going to get your money,but I want to hear her voice. Spike,where would you go with override codes? Basement.System would have to be rebooted from the secure servers there. There's cctv in the basement hallways,but there's no eyes in the server room. Okay,well,eyesould be good. Turn the lights off in the hallways. Got it.Eyes flying in. don'T.No!No!No,please!Please,no! We're gonna do a drive-by check for sentries. If it's clear,we're gonna stage in the alley south of adee,full-on stealth approach. Bad news.Guns and gangs says viper's controlled by huesos de tigre. South american bangers. That fits. They use someone on the inside to hit up the bank,and then they use kidnapping to make sure they cooperate. Le Gang unit's been profiling these guys since they moved in here three weeks ago. My... my baby!Please! This M.O. Goes one of two ways. They either don't get the money and kill the hostage... and two? My baby,please... please! They get the money. And they still kill the hostage. we'll cross between the buildings. We'll access through the roof. Copy that. We've I.D.'D two of them. Okay,there's an oscar cardoza and a hector puente. Just the two? No,they say there's four,maybe five,start-up crew. Could it be more?There's no way to know for sure. Sam,you're sierra. Copy that. Spike: I'm in the basement and approaching the server room. Deploying camera.Aeyesnd ears.How am I doing? Subject's two floors away. how far down? The basement.Move.Seven minutes. They're here. Subject's approaching the main server.You seeing this? Got it. Stayedceal,spike. Or the bad guy pulls the plug.Copy,boss. That's the sver? I got to enter the codes and reboot. We get into the system and make the transfer. Can you do that in seven minutes? If you shut up,yes. Wordy. You're good? Getting there. Got it. Bravo te going in. What's going on? Mein fra's powering up. Come on,come on,come on,come on. Okay,here we go. okay,he's g it open. He's in. what?

What,do you want a million dollars in your account or a mess on the floor? I am going as fast as I can,so let me do this! Single subject.Armed. What about a distraction? Bring him to us.One less inside. jus,it's time. -Jus? -I know,I know. Come on,come on,come on. done. no,no,no,no,no! What is it?Justin,what'soing on? Justin?!Justin,what is it? -It's over. -It's over? Spike? Sounds like he didn't get through.Maybe the codes were expired,the system time-bombed... Bravo team,deal might have fallen through.What's your 20? One floor away. Boss,got a call going out. I'm ready. But I'm not doing it until I know maya's alive.So will you put her on the phone? Justin? Hey,sweetie. Are you okay? Did they... did...? No. I'm okay. You got their money? I tried. I did. I know you did. I know. Have I ever told you how much I love you? Okay,you talked. Justin: You'll have your money in a minute. So your brother was right. -What? -Spike,stay alert. Mike mckewonay be closer to this gang than we thought. Copy,boss. He's always talkg about you,man. You're the smart one,right? You know him? He wasn't doing too good today,man,you know? And then he tells us,"my brother justin,he works for a bank," and that you'd take care of it... like you always do. He's a lucky guy to have a brother like you. Spike,stay close.We got a situation. jus,jus,look,there's gotta be something else we can do,right? You know?We can do something else,man.Come on. Just get back in there and,um... right,jus? I'll take care of things... like I always do. Jus,man,what the hell,man? Get the,get the,get the gun off me. You said you didn't know them. They knew you.And you told them  ai workt a bank. No,no,man,that's not what happened. Stop lying to me! spike,he's not picking up.You get in there.We're on our way. Mike: No,that's not what happened. Sru!Drop your weapon! My wife is dead,so you...you do what you need to do. It doesn't matter anymore. Justin,we're working on getting your wife out safely. You told them that I would do this for you,because... because I always cave,right?Because I always say yes. They were gonna kill me,man. So you sell me out? And maya? Okay,I do know those guys,I know 'em. But I never thought they'd take maya,man. I didn't even know about the half a million. So you're just stupid. And now you've killed my wife and my baby. Parker: Justin,we know where your wife is. We're here to help you. My team is working on getting her right now. -You're lying. -No,no. We're doing everything we can to make sure she comes out of there safely, but hurting your brother's not gonna help anything. This is his fault. This is your fault! He wrecks everything es touch! Blaming him's not the answer,my man. You both lost your parents. I can't even imagine what that was like. And then you both had to go your separate ways,but you got to stay with family. Mike wasn't so lucky,was he? He made his own luck. He's been making his luck ever since. Yeah,I'm just saying from his point of view,you got the roof over your head, you got to go to school. So when he's in trouble he comes to you because you owe him,right? So he messes up,you always help him. He counts on you,and you never let him down. So,this is my fault? I think your only fault is that you're always helping him. It's hard not to help someone you love,though,right? So,come on,my man. Let someone help you for once. We're gonna get your wife out of there. We're gonna get your wife out. Get your hands on your head! Hands on your head! Hands on your head! Boss,we're at the door. answer the phone. spread the word,man,'cause this is what happens when you break your promise with huesos de tigres! No,please don'T.Don't do anythingo her,please. You listening? no,no,no! 'Cause this is what it sounds like! Sru!Get down on the ground! Stay down on the ground or you will be shot! Do not move! Do not move! T it pu down.Put the gun down. You heard me.Put it down. Back off or I'll kill the bitch! No solution. -Sierra... -no solution. It's over. what's going on?!What happened?! hostage secured.We got her. it's okay.We got you. It's okay. You're all right. Let me hear her voice.Let me hear her. Eddie,put her on. How's donna?She done with siu? You know,we were lucky to have her there today. We're lucky to have her,You know? And I've been thinking,she's as good as any one of us. Any one of us,greg.Maybe even better. And you're asking why I'not putting the best person for the job on the team? It's crossed my mind. Heea a tm's alchemy. It's more than the sum of its parts,right? -Donna is great,but jules is... -jules is family,and I get that. And I'm behind you a hundred percent,and you know that. And I will welcome her back with open arms. She's a great team member. But I gotta ask you: When the call comes in,are we sending in a swat team or are we sending in family? got a sec? Yeah,come on in. Hey,you were excellent out there today. Excellent,and I want you to know that. Thank you. -Donna... -can I make this easier on you? Team three's got a spot for me. They say,got my name all over it. And how do you feel about that? I'm not here to upset your team's center of gravity. Call me if you need me.
