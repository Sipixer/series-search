Jess, it's me. Look, I know you're there, just listen. I'm not saying you don't got every right to be pissed. But what I been through in these last few months it's made me realize, It's made me see.. I've changed and I'm ready. I just wanna be with you and our baby boy. Jess? What's wrong? He's gone Terry. I gave him up, i gave our baby away. What? Is that the guy? Good... it's good when they run, huh? Yeah. Save some for the rest of us. Will do. Four arrests, one warrant. I know what you're thinking, that is some kind of record, ed. How do you do it? Well, Greg, I find... how's she doing? She's fine. She shot a cop in the line of the duty. She did her job. And you're saying she's got no reaction, no issues. No... I'm saying. You cut me some slack when I had issues. She deserves the same. I told you i was pregnant, You went out for smokes And what, how many months later you come back? That's messed up. I was just doing a lot of thinking. Yeah well, so was i. They made this introduction book. The agency showed it to me. Look at the house they got on the bridlepath. I've never even been up there. And then I told myself, Doesn't he deserve that? You know, when he was born something in me just said, This is wrong. And then I was trying to tell myself that feelings were wrong, That it was the right thing to do. And I tried calling them once to change my mind, But they only have three weeks and it was one past... But it was the right thing to do. It was just the right thing to do. Terry, I'm so sorry. No, no, no, I'm the one who left. I'm the one spent the last two years a mess. But you, you don't have a thing to be sorry for. Except for maybe hooking up with in the first place. But I'm here now and if you'll let me I want to make this work. Does he have a name? I don't know. Well, what were you gonna name him? Owen. Really? Yeah. Can we just do one last thing? Come on, sweetie. Terry, I don't think this is such a good idea. You said they were nice people. Nice people aren't gonna say no. Hey Jessie. What's this about? It's Andrew, right?

No! You still owe him for the last time, remember? The robbery thing. It wasn't robbery, it was theft under a thousand. Porter, we can see if she can help. No, she said you couldn't call her anymore. You know, if we're gonna be a family you're going to have to have this stuff I'm thinking! Don't scream. You're scaring him. It's the police. You tell them we're not getting out of this van until we got a lawyer. Hello? Hi, my name is sergeant Gregory parker. I'm with the police strategic response unit. Am I speaking with Jessie wyeth?

Your baby wants a bottle. What's your baby's name? His name's owen. So, what do you say Jessie, We all stop, get owen some formula? Maybe you can tell us your side of things? No,we have the formula in the diaper bag. But Terry says we can't stop until we have a lawyer. Okay, i can work on that, But it'll be a lot easier for me to do if we aren't speeding down the highway. It'd be safer too for owen. Terry, i think we should stop. What's he saying to you? Whatever he's saying, you know he's lying. No, he's just saying we should stop and be safe for owen. Yeah. And then we stop and they get him. Where do you think he's going? You wanna call tami and ask her right now? No. He's not going to tamI's. Yeah, 'cuz I'm not going to let that happen!

I'm going to pull back, Let them slow down and keep that baby safe. Copy that. Copy. Falling back. Jess, it's okay, we lost them. I think we need to stop this. All I want is what everybody wants. I know, I want it too, but I mean... all that time I was away all i could think of was you, us and him, :Jessie: where were you, Terry? What did you do? Boss, the girl listed a Terry dornan as next of kin on her That's great, winnie. Go ahead. If this is him he's got a record And a long history of violence. Listen to this, two months ago he almost killed a guy. Terry sebastian dornan, 20 years old. Last few months he was in jail for assault. On the 15th of june police were called to 1678 ossington where mr. Dornan and Kurt lawford, shared an apartment. Upon arrival police noted blood on the walls, floor, and ceiling. Jess, i can do this for you and him, But I just want to do one more thing. I really think we should stop now, Terry. Please, just one more thing then we'll go downtown and we'll turn ourselves in. Okay, one more thing. Boss, we lost them. Yeah. I see them, taking the off-Ramp. Okay team, let's take the next exit and look back. I just want to do one thing as a family, jess. It'll be great, you'll see. Okay? Team, any eyes on the subject? Negative. Winnie, you still trying that number? No answer the last four times. Okay, keep trying. Anything else on dornan? Background, family, anything? Both parents are dead. Though they didn't die together, mother died, looks like some sort of car accident. He was four. Father, I'm just getting a date, almost a year later. After that I'm getting multiple addresses for dornan. Over ten, till he was 18. Yeah, those aren't relatives, those are foster homes. Keep looking, guys. Terry, what are we doing? Terry! Terry, we can't go in there. Just trust me, it's gonna be great. He's going to love it. Look, we're okay. Boss, I got her. Here she is! Jessie, hey it's Greg parker again. I'm really glad to hear that you're okay. So where are you? We're in... We're safe, okay? And we're gonna turn ourselves in, we just need to do this one thing. Owen's still hungry, huh? How are you coming with that formula? I don't know how to make it. I should know this! What am I doing? Jessie, you know who's born knowing this stuff? Nobody. Having a baby, that's one thing, But taking care of him honey, that's something else. You can't do it on the run. Oh yeah, well, if I was a real mother, You know, I would have learnt, i wouldn't have just given him up. Or you knew what your baby would need And made sure he got it like a real mother would. So Jessie, why don't you tell me where you are. We're at the northern dreampark, okay? We're almost done and then we're coming in downtown. Okay Jessie, just stay on the line. I gotta go. Eddie, northern dreampark. Copy that. Let's step on it, folks. Ready? Terry, can we go now? Yeah. What's this? It's just one last thing. I know exactly where it is, he's gonna love it. Terry, come on. Please. Let's just go. Please. Please. Terry... come on. I can't wait for you to see this and owen too. Winnie, Jessie mentioned a tami, Some connection to dornan find out what it is. I'm on it. What do you think? Well? Yeah, it's pretty. Come on, come on. All right, I'm sierra one. Spike and Lewis, alpha team, west side of the park. Wordy and donna, east side of the park, bravo team. Weapons? Dornan may not be armed, but he's violent and unstable. So tasers, if we can. What about long-Range? Rubber bullets. That baby is the priority. If he gives us no choice, we do what we got to do. Clear? Clear. I don't think... guys, get going. Donna, you got a problem? No, I'm good. You sure? Yeah. Let's go! You all right? Yep. You good? Yeah. Here, give him to me. Please. You sure? Okay. Terry, watch his head, watch his head. I got it, I got it. Okay team, keep me posted. Nothing yet, boss. No joy here either. Right down here? Yup. You know, when your daddy was almost 4 his mommy and his daddy And your daddy, well, he thought the whole world lived in this park. And at the centre of this world was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Horses and families, everybody together. Eddie, I'm about to talk to this tami. See what more we can get on our subject here. If you see him, let me know right away. Copy that. No, I spent more time in court with him than all What did he do now? How long did he live with you? Two years. Time he was sixteen to the time he walked out. Can't say I was sorry. Quite a handful, huh? No, a handful's what I'm used to. You ever spend the night with a baby's not getting his crack from mommy's milk? That I'm used to. When Terry came everybody said, look, this is a really hard one. I said, yeah, hard or not, Every kid wants love and that I got to give. Okay. So what made him different? Look, no kid likes a foster home. Every kid wants to believe that some day mommy and daddy Are going to come back and everything's going to be better. Well, Terry never even had that, His mother dead from that accident, and then his father, I don't know, maybe you just never get over something like that. What happened to his father? Oh, and this one. This one. This was my favorite, he'd never forget it. And my daddy. Hey, you know what his name was? It was owen. Just like you, buddy. There's nothing in quadrant e2. No dice in w4. I need a better vantage point. Thank you. Sierra 1 in position. No sign. Hold on, hold on. At the carousel. Bravo team, that's closest to you. There it is. Okay. Wordy, donna, stealth approach. Alpha team, what's your 20? Alpha team's on the move and we're far. I didn't cry. Well, you were 4, Terry he's just a baby. Give him to me. I thought we were gonna go downtown together. Yeah, we will. Then what are they doing here? Terry, I'm sorry. When I go to jail you'll probably never see me again, right? You'll just give me up. We were supposed to be together. Supposed to? Terry, we did all of this together. He's escalating, he's got the baby. You know, maybe it doesn't matter how much we want it. We have to think about what he needs, okay? Give him to me. No! No? It's too late. Terry! Give him to me. No! Terry! He's seen us. Cover's blown, we're in pursuit. Wordy, on the girl. Donna, follow the male. Spike and Lou, get to the carousel. I got him. You got him? Splitting up. Terry! Stay right there. Stay right there! I gotta go, i gotta go. I know, I know, I know. I can't let him go alone. I need you to calm down. Listen, I know. Wordy, hold on, i got him. Donna, wait on my go. Boss, he's heading for the stairs and he's got the baby. Eddie, stop him. He's too far to tase. Then go lethal. Rubber bullets? They might not do it, Ed, if he makes it up there that baby could die. Copy that. I don't have a clear shot. Sabine, do you have the solution? Sabine, you have scorpio, take the shot. Negative. No solution. The baby's in jeopardy. He's going up the coaster, but he can't go any place once he's at the top. Yes, he can. He can go the way his father went, he can jump. Donna, wordy, wait on my lead. Copy. Copy. Hey Terry, wait up, buddy. It's me, Greg parker. I want to help you. I have to get up there! I have to get up there! Listen, there's nothing you can do up there but put He has my baby! Terry, hey it's me, Greg. Come on. Hold up a second. Hey, I just want to talk to you. It's okay. It's all right. You get her out of here. I made her do this, she shouldn't have to see this! What this? What do you mean? Hey, can I talk to you for a second, just man to man, what do you say? Know what I see? I see a guy who's trying to do the right thing But suddenly finds himself in the wrong place. Is that close? I bet you don't even want to be up here. In fact, I bet you can't imagine why you're even up here. What, do you think I'm stupid? No. I think you got feelings. I think you got big, gigantic feelings, The kind that just come out of your stomach and make you feel like what do you And you've never had anybody in your life to teach you about those feelings, To help you with those feelings. And that's not fair. Oh, I had lots of people, loads of families. Different one every year. Sure. They've never been your real family, right? What's going on? It's under control. My ma died when I was just 4. I know. Yeah? You know what happened to my old man? You know that too? Yeah, yeah, I do. That's why I want to help you. Five years old. My ma's dead not a year. And we go up to the top of our building. Hey, just stay with me, buddy. Just stay with me. And I remember he puts me down by the door And he gives me a piece of paper. I can't read. I don't know what's on it. And I'm just standing there, looking up at my dad as he walks to the edge. Terry, you're not your father. You're your own person. So what's wrong with me? Nothing. What is wrong with me? Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Still have the solution, but no way to take him out without the baby going over too. Copy that. All I want is what everybody gets. What do you want? You tell me. I want my family. I want to come home and they're there every day, no matter what. I want my little boy to look at me and say, Daddy, don't leave. And I say, I would never. You've got it. You've got it. You've already got it. You've got Jessie. She loves you. She wants you to come back down safe. You and owen. Oh my god, he's bleeding. No, no, no, Terry, it's okay. It's just your hand. It's okay. It's okay. Look at what I'll do every time, won't i? No, no, it doesn't have to go that way. It doesn't have to go that way. It's going to be okay. No. You were the one who told Jessie he was hungry. That's right. Probably still is hungry. Why don't we go feed him together, come on. Go feed him together, okay? Come on. Come on, that's it. That's it. Okay. Thank you. Team, be ready. Take care of him for me. You bet. Here we go, here we go. That's it, I got him. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're not going anywhere. You're not going anywhere. Don't go. Don't go, Terry, don't go. Don't go, my man. Terry! Terry! No, no! Jessie! No, no, Terry. I'm sorry. Terry! We'll debrief later,all right? All right. Okay. Jessie, there's a police officer over there, he's ready to take a statement. Did he say anything before he... yeah, he said to take care of him for me. His dad wrote that, in a note. I have to take owen now, Jessie. His name's liam. I'm sorry. The subject's family history made suicide likely And the danger to the infant was extreme. I gave the order to take the shot. Constable sabine was unable to do so and the subject made it to the structure and ascended. Donna, you have anything to add? At this point constables sabine And wordsworth pursued the subject. Hey, tomorrow we're going to do this debrief again. And you're telling the boss what really happened. Because, donna, the only thing's that more dangerous than a cop Who shoots too fast, is a cop who can't shoot when they need to. Now you had the shot, and I saw it. You saw it? Where were you then? Because where I was there I pointing a gun at a scared kid with a baby in his hands. We got an order. You questioned the order. Yeah, I did, But the boss had information we didn't have. I asked a question and then I did my job Like any member of this team is supposed to. All right? Are you a member of this team? Yes. That's good. Does this job get any easier?
