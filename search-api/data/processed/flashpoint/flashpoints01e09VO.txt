can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven. The mind is its own place, and in itself can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven. Come on. Pick up the phone. I swear to God I will kill her and I will take you down. The mind is its own place, and in itself can... - Penny? - No! It's time. * When the blazing sun is gone * * When he nothing shines upon * * Then you show your little light * * Twinkle,twinkle all the night.* Hey, Pips. Check this out. Globular cluster. Messier 3, I think. Who ate the ketchup chips? Must've been the coyotes. Grape juice? Coyotes drink grape juice, too? Hey, Pips, see if you can find Saturn. I'm going for more grape juice. For me. Not you, me. * When the traveler in the dark * * Thanks you for your tiny spark * * He could not see which way to go...* That was fast, Dad. Dad? Dad? "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." Good morning, Sunshine. You can call me Sunshine as long you promise to... Ah, yes, letter of application. Basic Tactical Operations course. I'm signing it right now. - Thank you, Sarge. - My pleasure, Kira. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Just... just the way it always is. Gerald? Hey, babe. Where are you? Nearly home. How'd you sleep? I didn't. I kept hearing noises. - But you know you're safe, right? - I know. - Hey, you know what? - What? I've got a surprise for you. - You okay? - I'm gonna wet my pants. Okay. Come on. Let's go. She's been missing for 12 hours. Police say she was abducted last night from a playground in Sault Sainte Marie. Her mother says her back was turned for only a second, and then, Lilly Deacon vanished. Lilly was wearing a yellow dress and pink sandals. She has long blonde hair, and has a birthmark under her chin shaped like a teardrop. Hey, guys. - Hi, restroom? - Yeah, out back. Hang on. - You need a key. There you go. - Thank you. Hey, Sarge, Wordy said you wanted to see me? Hey, Jules, grab a seat, will you? Ooh, that bad? Psych evaluations, you know they're mandatory, right? Yeah, I do. I just, uh... You just haven't signed up for one yet. Everyone else has done theirs already, and I wanted to make sure things were copacetic. Everything's copacetic. Look. Look at me. I'm signing up right now. You know it's like this with you every year, Jules. It's like, uh, nobody likes to do this. I know, they just freak me out. All those questions. Who do you like better: your mom or dad? You want to garden or paint? Fly a plane? Jump on a train? They're just questions. No right or wrong answers. That's the problem: I like right or wrong. You shoot. There's a target. You hit it. Bull's-eye. Bam. You go home. That's true. You can be perfect. Scared to make mistakes-- it's going to get in your way. We're human. We're going to get things wrong. Hey, great. So pump #2? That's, uh, $47. 28, please. Hey, who's this? What's your name? Jack. He's a little shy. Hey, Jack, uh, tell me. What's your favorite flavor here: cherry or grape? It's okay. It's on the house. Cherry. Okay, but here comes the cherry airplane. Up it goes. How about some change? Sure. Sorry about that. And here we go. 911? Uh, yeah, um... The-the missing girl? Lilly, Lilly something? Um, she's here. She's here at my gas station. And she's, she's with a man and he has a gun. Ma'am, are you certain it's the child? Yes, I'm absolutely sure. She's wearing boy's clothes, and she has a birthmark underneath her chin. Okay, ma'am, I need you to stay calm, but if you can get a license plate... License plate... License plate. Team One, gear up. We have a sighting of missing child Lilly Deacon, traveling in a car license plate: Romeo 1 Bravo Uniform 4 Hotel 8. Registered to a Gerald Duglin, 60 Red Brick Lane, East Scarborough. Penny? You're home. I told you I was close. Hello? I want you to meet someone. Surprise. Penny, this is Lilly. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly presents</font> -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> Flashpoint Season01 Episode09</font> Team One, Child Services have been notified and they're standing by; uniform units are en route to secure the perimeter. Copy that. Advise those units to use radio code only. Media will be on their scanners, and this girl's been going through enough without all that. This guy's been driving all night. Lilly Deacon was abducted, what, 500 miles north of here. You did a beautiful job, Penny. It's clean, huh? You could eat off the floor. Why? Why what? Why is she here? Did I do something? All right, what's going on? Nothing. My son-- he sent back another letter, return to sender, big surprise. You've got to see him in person. Where... He's in Dallas, right? You've got to go there. It doesn't matter if they slam the door in your face. Ah, I think I'm done, you know? Lilly... follow me. Come here. This is really special, okay? You are very important to me. And this is going to help keep you safe. There. Now what do you say? What do you say when someone gives you a present? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Here's how it works. You get too close to a door or window, and you're going to feel a little buzz. That's a warning. And what happens if we don't pay attention to the buzz? What happens if we go outside the house? You cross the underground wire and the bracelet electric-shocks you and you die. But you know what? It's better to die than to get caught by the police 'cause you know what happens if you caught by the police? They'll hurt you so bad, you'll wish you were dead. 11:32 a.m. Armed abduction of a child. Subject Gerald Duglin presumed to be in the residence at 60 Red Brick Lane with the abducted child, Lilly Deacon. This is where we have to stay until it's safe to go out again. We have no choice. It's what your parents wanted. It's why they asked me to bring you here. They didn't. Yeah, they did. Your dad and I had a long talk before we left last night. My daddy wasn't there last night. He was in Buffalo with my grandma. We talked on the phone. Come here. First rule of the house. No talk-back. You're probably hungry, huh? That's good. You know why? 'Cause Penny's going to make us lunch. Penny. Teenager next door confirmed Gerald's car pulled in ten minutes ago. He didn't notice a child. As far as they know, he has no family, no children, and he is, quote, "quiet and keeps to himself." Yeah, I'll bet. You see his windows? Every single one frosted, shuttered. Apparently, he's a contractor. Built this whole development. Mug shot. Okay. The guy's got two priors for sexual assault. Spent a couple months in jail a decade ago. And he's got no weapons registered. Except he's got one. We have to have rules here. Rules keep us safe. It's all really, really simple. Why don't I show you the rest of the house? Come on. - I'll take you upstairs. - Gerald... Yes, Penny? Um, let me show her around. You're making lunch. - I can make it later. - What? She's tired. She-she only just got here. I hear your voice one more time... Please just let me take care of her. Lilly, no! Lilly! Lilly, come here. She's just scared, Gerald. Penny, get in the closet. No... Gerald, no. In the closet. Please, please, she didn't mean it. Gerald, no! Enough. I've had enough. That's enough, okay? That's it. I've had enough of you. Okay? The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna show you the rest of house first. We can explore. You want to see upstairs? Come on. Come on. Pick up the phone. Hello? Hello, Mr. Duglin? This is Sergeant Gregory Parker, with the Police Strategic Response Unit. Am I speaking with Gerald Duglin? Mr. Duglin, a little girl has been abducted and we have reason to believe that she's inside your house. Now if you and the other occupants can please exit, we can start talking about how you can safely return Lilly to her parents. If you're interested in her safety, then you stay out of my house. You step one foot in this house, and I swear to God I will kill her and I will take you down. No! It's time. They're here. You know what to do. I know what to do. Come on. Pick up the phone. Like we practiced, like I showed you. What's happening? They've come, okay. - Who's come? - Don't worry. I'll protect you. Come on. Quick, Penny. Okay, take that. Take that. Well, you're staying with us though... We're going to need more ammo, okay? - We've got more in the basement.I'll be right back. - No, we don't have any time. Two minutes. I'll be right back. I promise. Without you, no life. Okay? No. Let me come with you. - No! Gerald! Gerald! - Please don't leave me! 11:43 a.m. First telephone contact terminated by subject. Threats uttered to hostage and police units. All right. He's not reestablishing. Hey, Ed? Holding in position. I can't reestablish. If you go in... Dangerous for the girl, but if we don't go in... Dangerous for the girl. Copy that. Spike, head to white, keep your eyes on the front. Copy that. We're in the garage. Help me. Help me tip the table. Close the door. We can't. He's coming back. How long do we have to stay in here? As long as it takes. Garage door breached. Entry clear. Kitchen's clear. Boss, table's set for three. Clear. Living room's clear. He saw us coming. Sarge. I'm looking at a box for an electric dog collar. He might have a containment around the house. So let's cut the circuit. First floor clear. We got something downstairs. We got eyes. Okay, we've got Lilly Deacon with another young woman, approximately 16 years of age in... looks like the master bedroom. No sign of Duglin. Let's transmit that to Kira, see if she can ID that other girl. Possible accomplice. Hey, Sam, can you get another angle of the bedroom? See if Duglin's in there? Copy that. He's not in there, boss. Boss, Lilly's upstairs, correct? That's affirmative. Where are you? Basement steps. - Police Strategic Response Unit! - Police! - Get down! - Weapons on the ground! - Hands in the air! Weapons on the ground! - Let me see your hands! Looks like somebody's been transcribing a book. By hand. Paradise Lost. Milton. Adam and Eve in Paradise. Good stuff. Fire and brimstone, my dad's kind of book. How long have you lived here? A long time. Don't you ever want to go home? Get down. Guys, she's armed. Yes, she is. Camera's down. All right, stand by for immediate action. Let's get up closer to the house. We're on the move. We're gonna need two units lead us up. Eddie, check in. Where are you? Boss, I don't know how he did it, but he's completely disappeared. We lost him. Go careful. Duglin's not upstairs. We're on the move. You heard that, right? It's like a... like a scraping sound or... Ed, look at these marks on the floor. Go, go, go. Sarge, we found a tunnel. We're going in. Okay, you go for it, but keep me posted. Sarge, I think I got a match on your girl. I'm sending it through now. Rap sheet, any priors? No, sir, found her in Missing Persons. Matches an aged-up picture of Penny Westler. Who? Missing child taken from her own backyard eight years ago: stranger abduction. - No arrest made. - Oh, my God. She must be 17 by now. Okay, team, subject is on foot. Constables Lane and Wordsworth are in pursuit. We've got the neighborhood contained. We need to get this under control now. We're in front of the house now. Change of plans: we're gonna talk this girl down. Jules, I want you to do it. Oh, Sarge, if you're right, this girl's been in here, like, eight years. We're dealing with some serious Stockholm syndrome. She probably doesn't even know who she is anymore. I know, and my bet, he's conditioned her to fear the police, and that's why she's firing. Now, you're gonna be fine. This girl has spent eight years in captivity at the hands of a man. What she needs now is a female voice. All right, we're starting at ground zero. I mean, I... I don't know if I know how to do this. All right, I'm coming in. Okay, wait. Can you help me with the Stockholm? Yeah. Now, the first thing to remember... there will be nothing simple about her feelings for her captor. Just follow the same rules as always: connect, respect... Protect. Okay. Okay, just keep it simple. By now, Penny's got a belief system that has helped her survive whatever it is she survived, and it's not your job to tear that down. It's your job to get these two girls out of there safely, and I'm gonna stay right here and be your second inside your ear the whole time, all right? Copy. Spike, you go with Sam; you cover Jules. Lou, we need to track down Penny's parents. Get them here fast, but I need to talk to them first. - Copy. - Eddie, what's your 20? We're in a tunnel heading west. Okay, stay on it. Kira, you want to map this out for us, tell us where the hell we are? He's up ahead. Go, go, go. Hey, girls, my name is Jules. Slow down, Jules. Just work against the adrenaline. Your names are Penny and Lilly. Is that right? Well, I'm a police officer, and I'm here to help you both. You know, I'd really like to open these doors so that we can speak easier. Is that okay? All right, I'm opening the door, but I promise you, I'm gonna stay back here, all right? Penny, is that right? The little girl that you have with you, her name is Lilly Deacon, and I'm really hoping that we can return her safely to her mom and dad. Can we can work that out? Can you help us out with that? Get away from us! Team status-- everybody. No harm. - No harm, no harm. - No harm. Sarge? De-escalate, Jules, de-escalate. Whatever Penny's world was an hour ago, it's a whole lot more confusing now, so just... just keep doing what you're doing. Just stay covered. How do they know my name? Everything they say is a lie. Penny? I know that you are very scared right now. I mean, you've got a gun with you. And guns are always scary. But I... but I really believe that you don't want to hurt anyone. I really believe that, Penny. So what do you think? What do you think? Can we get rid of the gun? So that we can talk without being scared? Penny, if you and Lilly don't say anything, how am I gonna know that you're okay? Leave us alone! Gerald? Gerald! What did you do to him? Okay, okay, okay... Sergeant, I got Penny's parents on the line. Squad car's got them en route. Jules, Jules, you're doing great. That's great news. She made her first request. She wants to know about Gerald, okay? So remember, just take your time, slow it down, and get her to yellow. Penny, I know that you want Lilly and Gerald to be safe. So you know what... you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna find out for you. I'm gonna see where he is and how he's doing. 'Cause I think the guys I work with, they might know. Do you want me to ask? Yeah. Okay. Guys, any word on Duglin? Guy tapped into some tunnel system in the basement. Guy knows what he's doing. Kira, we're in a tunnel with railroad tracks. Where are we? Brickworks-- whole subdivision used to be a brick factory. Red Brick Lane, Kiln Avenue... What's up ahead? Which way you going? Still heading west. Westbound, tunnel ends in a warehouse. You're gonna have to go up a level. Where is he? Where is he? Mrs. Westler, Mr. Westler, I'm Greg Parker. We spoke on the phone. Where is she? She's in that house, but we need to be incredibly patient here. We haven't seen our daughter in eight years. You can't imagine... I understand, but Penny's exit from that house has to be on her terms, at her pace. If she's rushed in any way, she may freeze up, she may escalate. The only way we can get your daughter out of there safely is if we help her choose to come out. She seems nice. Why can't we just go? Because... they'll capture us, and what happens after that is... What? What? It's complicated. Have you heard of Anne Frank? She was a little girl who lived with her family in an attic for years waiting for it to be safe to go outside because bad people were in charge, and they sent police in to drag people away to barbwire prisons. It was just like hell, but on earth. Like devils and fire and people burning? Exactly. So that's just like now. So we have to be brave and wait for Gerald to come back for us. Penny, I found out about Gerald. Do you want to hear? Yeah. Okay, well, this might sound kind of funny, but we... we don't know where he is. No. No, you've captured him. You had the house surrounded; we saw it on the alarm screens; you surrounded us. I know... I know that this seems impossible, but he left. No, he wouldn't leave. Penny, I promise you. There's a tunnel that leads out of the basement. You're making fun of me? No, I'm not. Penny, I would not make fun of you. I know that you're waiting for Gerald to come back. I can tell that you care a lot about him. "So dear I love him that with him all deaths I could endure, without him no life." It's from the book. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. - Penny? - it's okay. It's gonna be okay... It's gonna be okay. I want to go home. No, no, no, no. I want to see my mommy and daddy. No, they sent you here to be safe. No, they... they didn't. He made that up. I'm going home. No, Lilly, what are you doing? I want to go home... now. Sarge, Lilly wants to come out. No, you can't walk out there. They're going to send you to prison. Lilly, we're not going to hurt you, I'm promise you on my life. We're not going to hurt you. Lilly, you can't walk out there. Lilly, your mom and dad-- they're on a plane. They're coming in from Sault Sainte Marie. They're so excited to see you. - I'm going home. - Lilly! I won't let them take you away! What's going on, guys? Penny's holding her gun on Lilly. She thinks Lilly's going into a trap. Jules, I don't have eyes in. This is your call, but if Penny is threatening Lilly... She's not going to hurt her. Jules, stand down. The little girl's the priority. Sam? I have it. She's not going to hurt her. Lilly? Stay here. Penny, we're not going to take Lilly anywhere, unless she chooses to go. There is no choice. That's what the book says. Okay, I didn't read that book, Penny. But this what I know about choice. Okay? Gerald made a choice today. He chose to leave you. And Lilly-- Lilly's making a choice. She wants to see her mom and dad. And you made an amazing choice. The most amazing choice. Because you just met this little girl, and you're protecting her, and not everybody would do that. Penny, please, let her choose. Please. She's not going to hurt her. Lilly? Don't go outside! You'll cross the underground wire... Penny, she's going to be fine. We cut the wire. Why don't you look for yourself. Why don't you look out the window, Penny. Sam, hold off. Lilly? I have the solution. Lilly, it's okay. Okay, right down the stairs, okay? There you go. That's great. Good, good. All right? Right over here, okay? You're going to be okay. You're going to be fine. Ed. That's a revolver, right? Six in a chamber, that's number three. Four. Five. Where's six? Where's six? Where's six? Penny! Penny! Oh, my God. You got it? I got it. Gerald, it's over. Just put the gun down and come down those steps. Hands in the air. Hands where we can see 'em. Stop! Okay? Just stop. All right, it's up to you. Just put the gun down and come down or we will come in there. You have five seconds. You don't understand. No one does. Explain it to me, Gerald. This isn't what I wanted. Yeah? What did you want? To be happy. Just like anybody else. You're not like everybody else, Gerald. Put the gun down. I can't. Without her no life. There's six. - Jules... - It's okay. Penny. Thank you for letting Lilly choose. He said I'd die if I left the house. Penny... No. No! You have him. We don't. We don't. You have him and he isn't coming back! We don't. We do not have him. No! Without him no life! Okay, Penny. Penny, please. Please. Two minutes. That's what he said. He said two minutes. He promised. He said he was coming back. It's not true, is it? He isn't coming back, is he? Sarge, she's got her gun on Jules. Jules, you gotta control this thing. I have the solution. Copy that, Sam. Your call. It's your call. No. Please. Sarge, you gotta let me do this. She's going to be okay. Okay, Penny, I want to help you go home. I want to help you remember the girl that you used to be. Good thinking, Jules. I'll get the mother on it. Feed her memories. Sarah, I need you to tell us about your child. Any time that she felt joy or safe or loved or thrilled or anything. I remember the snowstorm in the country. We were walking, uh, trying to get to the house. There was a snowstorm. You and your parents. And then we lost her. Remember we couldn't find her? And my heart was pounding. Only for a minute they-they couldn't see you because of all the snow. Yeah, and then we did. We scooped up Pips, and we took her home. And you got to stay up late. Do you remember that? And they gave you three desserts. Oh, mosquito netting. She used to have it over her bed like a canopy. A canopy that was like a tent. And there were all these stuffed animals underneath. The telescope she got when she turned nine-- it's still there; it's still in her room. Man, I wanted a telescope so bad when I was a kid. Saturn. I don't even know where that is, but I guess you do. 'Cause that's what your parents are saying. They're right outside, Penny. They're right outside. They're waiting for you. Come on, Pips. Come on. Come on, Pips. Pip... Pip-squeak? - That's what that means, right? - Yes. That's what that means. I know you're really scared, Penny. I know. I totally understand. But outside-- that great big world-- it's even prettier than the one in your room. It's your choice. It's your choice. It's up to you. Yes? Yeah. Okay. You're safe. They're outside. They're right outside. On her time. Her time. Let her come to you. Julianna Callaghan, you made me proud. Yeah, and I wasn't even perfect. No, you weren't. You were human. That's what those girls needed. That's what they both needed to get out safe. Screwing up and being human. My biggest fear. Copy that. Look what happened. Planets aligned. It was a good day. Right? You coming for a drink? I'm buying. Nah. Actually, I'm going to go do something. But I'll see you Monday? Yeah. Yep. Right. Your e-ticket and credit card. Better hurry. It's the last flight. Dallas. Long way to go for two days. Not as long as it took me to do this. This one's for focus, right? Yeah. Yeah, that's for focus. Dad. The stars-- they're still there. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=-
