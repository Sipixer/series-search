How can that be ? where is he ? I mean it is n't the prosecution supposed to have all the evidence ? You know, I've talked to them to Cheznick Office.They haven't even admitted the papers may have been lost or misfiled. Those pages they proove my innocence, they are us frame.

We went through it all for the inquest, right? Stick to the facts, you got nothing to worry about. What? Just... what? Ed, give me one hour. You tell the story, and I work my magic, and then unfounded lawsuit disappears, you're back in your cape and tights. You're saving the world. You're still reading comic books, huh? That's nice. Let's do this. Prosecutor's Office-- how may I direct your call? Hi, uh, my name is Stan Smith. I'm an associate of Dan Cheznik's, from the Bar Association.

Sir, just empty your pockets, please? Thank you. Step to the side, please. - I just need to go in for a minute... - Step to the side. Raise your arms. - The prosecutor-- - Arms up! - He wanted to meet with me. - Feet apart, please. Look, if you could just have him paged... Raise your pant leg, sir. That's a parole device.

What's going on? I'm not finished. Sir? Just a sec. What's going on? They're evacuating.

I'm sorry, I don't know. Look, you work here, don't you? Yes, but not with him. Everything okay, folks? He's got a gun. Turn around, get out of here now or I will kill her. I swear I will.

Yeah, I'm in a stairwell off the thirfloor with a young man... What's your name? Forget my name. Ask about Cheznik. Young man? What are you saying, Ed? Are you telling me you're with the subject now? Yeah. Okay, hang tight. We're right outside the building. We're looking for a... for a prosecutor named Dan Cheznik. You got your gun, Ed? No, no, no. it's C-H-E... Are you telling me that he's got you at gunpoint? That's right, yeah. We just need a location for the young man and the lady here. - Okay, he's got a hostage? - Correct. Do you want the team on immediate action plan? Just give me yes. No... no. He's a prosecutor. Okay, just stay on the line with me, Ed. Tell him you'll call him back. Boss, I'm going to have to call you back. Okay. Stairwell off the third floor. The guy's got two hostages. One's a young woman. - How do we know? - 'Cause Ed's the second hostage. Guys, he doesn't have his gun with him. Oh, no. Okay, Ed's asking for a deliberate action plan. A 20 on a lawyer named Dan Cheznik. Wordy, first priority-- let's find Dan Cheznik. He's the target. - On it. - Jules, you're on the subject. Pull all profiles on guys wearing parole bracelets. - Okay, let's find out who this guy is. - Got it. - Spike, you and Lewis... - Kira, we got a guy here on parole wearing a bracelet. Mid-20s, black. We need an I.D. Jules, can you send a snap from the security footage video? Okay, he's charming, he's good-looking. Ed's going to be fine. Let's go. Hold up. Hold up. Hey, buddy. You okay? Boss, any luck for my friend here? No, we're still working on that. Can you stay on the line with me? They're working on it. It's just going to take a sec. I'm just going to stay... stay on the line here and get some information. No, no, hang up. Tell them to call you back when they know where he is. Boss, I'm going to need you to call me back. Copy that. Just stay cool, okay? Slow him down. Put him on our time, okay? Copy that. Where can I find Cheznik? Cheznik... He's prosecuting the Frasano case. That's Courtroom Seven, third floor. Room's already been locked down. What's the best way up there without getting near my guy in the stairwell? Rob will take you up. Rob. Okay, you can tell your guys to fall back. We'll take care of it from here. Thanks. Clear out a courtroom. We contain him inside there. You know what, let's stick with Courtroom Seven. Two birds with one stone. Gotcha. We get the prosecutor out of there while we prep it for tactical options. That's good. Plus we tell the kid one less lie. You know the layout here? Any windows? There's a bunch of windows looking out on King's Court, but you'll never see through them. That's all right, we'll take care of it. We'll get the subject contained, we'll settle him down. Wordy, you're team leader. Let's come up with tactical options, and just let me know when the room's clear, okay? All right, let's go. He's going to call back, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He'll call back. So, uh... this prosecutor must have... must have really done something bad to you, huh? To get you to pick up a gun and come back in here and risk your life. What were you convicted of? Murder, okay? He convicted me of murder. Guys, we can't stall him much longer. Answer it! - Yeah. - Okay, Courtroom Seven. For real. We're clearing it out now, so stall him. Take it slow. We're looking at the building plans right now. He doesn't have a location on the prosecutor yet, all right? But he's trying. Plan A, less lethal. Working on a surprise entry. What's he saying? He's working on it, he's working on it. Just give him a second. Plan B, lethal from across the court. The frosted windows looking west. We're going to need to use thermal. You copy that? Yeah. Okay, we've already got video. We'll lay in the audio. Look for an earwig on the prosecutor's table. - What is he saying? - Okay, okay... What is he saying? It's Courtroom Seven. Courtroom Seven. Which floor? Show me. Let's go. All right, she's scared, all right? You're making it worse. Walk now! Just put the gun down. Put the gun down and you can take me instead, okay? Take me instead. - Cuff him. - It's fine. - Now! - It's fine. Cuff him. I'll take the two of you. It's fine. Come on. If he's not in that room when I get there... It's okay. It's okay. Move. Your attention please. I'm Officer Wordsworth, Police Strategic Response Unit. - Which one of you is Dan Cheznik? - That'd be me. All right, come with me. The rest of you on your feet. Leave your things. We need you to clear this room immediately. Okay, so Dan Cheznik's one of the top senior prosecutors in the country. 15 years at the bar. Hundreds of cases. Near perfect conviction record. They're on the move. Oh, my God, they got Ed handcuffed. What the hell are you doing there? Guys, we need you to move fast. We'll answer all your questions outside. All right, they're almost at the courtroom. Still a half dozen people in there. Lewis, how's audio? Done. Earwig's on the table. Okay, subject is in the corridor, seconds away. Spike, let's go. Wait... Hey, no. Up. They're at the door. - Up. You can't be here. - I'm scared... - Five seconds. - Go. You don't get it, do you? I have nothing left. I'm not afraid to use this. I will kill you both, leave you both lying here. I do not care anymore. Okay, come here. That's it. Come on, buddy, just buy us a minute here. Buy us a minute here, huh? Come on, stop screwing around. Go! I got it. You lied. You said he'd be here. And they told me he would be. I thought he would be. You lied! You lied just like everybody else! This wasn't supposed to happen, oh, my gosh! He came into the courthouse with a gun looking for you, and you have no idea who he is? That could be anyone. You remember every bad guy you've arrested? Any idea why he'd go after you? Sure. Same reason I live in a bunker, drive home in an armored car. I'm a prosecutor who does his job well. Look-- just so you know, that's my teammate staring down the long end of this guy's gun. So, I'd appreciate it if you think real hard about this. Let's start over. Any hate mail recently, any threatening phone calls? Okay, thanks, it's downloaded. Boss, we have an ID. Subject is Michael Jameson, 26 years old, released from Kingston Penitentiary 12 weeks ago. What'd he do? 1997, raped and murdered one Katie Bakerton. You-- you're gonna get your cell phone, you're gonna call the police, and you're gonna tell them that they have 15 minutes to deliver Cheznik to me, or one of you dies! Do it! We've got a 15-minute deadline. Spike, Lewis, where are we in Plan A? Looking for a point of entry to the balcony. Might be a rooftop. Where there's a will, there's a way. Copy that, if that's the only way in. Sam, Wordy, where's Plan B? Cheznik's on his way down. We're heading into position. - We'll let you know when we're there. - Copy that. Got an ID on the girl he kills. Katie Bakerton. They, uh... said they were looking for him... all right? They said they're going to call any minute. Move towards him. I'm a cop. Move towards him. Distract him for a second. Just for a second. What are you doing? - I don't know. - Stop talking. Don't move! All right, why don't you just tell me you name. May-maybe I can help you. All right, what is it, a payback? Is it revenge? I don't want revenge. Ed, if you hear me, look up. All right, buddy. Okay. Just keep him contained close to the balcony, we'll drop from there. You stole a gun, you come in here, and... you're telling me you don't want revenge? I want my name back. And I want to know how they got a confession out of me when I never confessed. Two years, I've been waiting for the file to show up: the government's case against me. Well, today it did. And now my lawyer's telling me that the file isn't there. Now, I need to talk to the man that put me away, and I want him to look me in the eye and tell me what happened. Just got... just keep him talking. And try to find a point of connection. I've got Dan Cheznik here. Bring him in. I hear you. And you know what, you and me, we're not that different. Something happened a couple of months ago. I did something, and I... I keep having to defend it. Defend what I did. Name's Michael Jameson; you convicted him of the murder of Katie Bakerton. Katie Bakerton? When was that? Ten years ago? Eleven. It was a brutal murder. Okay, all right, got it, thanks. Here's the criminal index report. Ten minutes to deadline, Jules. Find out who his lawyer is. Get him on the phone. His lawyer? Alpha Team, what's your 20? Broaching blue, Alpha One. - Top of the world. - Copy that. Ed, Spike and Lewis are on their way. Stand by. Bravo Team, where are you? Ma'am, we need the room. Please come with me. Almost same position. How's Ed? He's hanging in there. He's trying to get this kid to open up. Maybe... maybe I look at myself differently, too. It's like... I know exactly what happened that day. I remember perfectly. And my brain keeps playing tricks on me and I start to go over it and over it in my mind and asking myself if maybe... I remember it differently. If maybe I was wrong. I did that for 11 years. They charged me as an adult, but I was 15 when they put me away. Never finished high school, never had a job... never kissed a girl. And I don't know anything about anything, but I know what happened that day, and I know I didn't kill Katie. Okay, boss, we're on the back roof. We should be at the vent soon. Copy that. Why don't you... why don't you tell me about her? What was she like? She's amazing. Incredible smile. She didn't have to be, but she's nice to everybody. Didn't matter what kind of family you had, house you lived in, she just saw you. So I showed up the first day at school, and I'm 12, the only black kid in the class... It's like they'd never seen it before. The kids are whispering and moving their desks. And I'm feeling like I just want to fall into a hole and disappear. Well, she comes right over and she sits beside me, smiles and tells me we're going to be friends. And just like that, we're friends. She was raped, dumped in the woods, tied her ankles, tied her wrists, slid her throat, covered her face with a T-shirt. Couldn't stand to see what he'd done. Just like that, best friends. Three years... Three years we were best friends until. I fell in love with her. All the evidence pointed to Michael. She was killed with a knife; he had a knife that fit the specs. She was raped before she was killed. Well, we knew from Michael's transcript he had said he wanted more from Katie. Did Katie feel the same way? I don't know. The day I told her, we rode to the park, she was sitting on the back of my bike, I was swerving, she was laughing. We were having such a great time. Just being together. Just us. Man, it was a perfect day. And then I just said it. I mean, I told her I loved her. What did she say? She said I was sweet. She leaned against me, kissed me on the cheek, and she asked me to give her a ride. Who's the girl on the right? And I said yes. I doubled her... doubled her to the corner near her house. She wanted me to drop her off. And he was the last person to see her alive. And that was the last time you saw her? Yeah. I remember this. I remember seeing her picture in the paper. I'm so sorry. 11 years in the joint, this guy still sounds like apple pie. Yeah, well, psychopaths, they spend years perfecting their stories. Sarge, I just got off the phone with Michael Jameson's lawyer. He backs it up. He says all the evidence against this guy was circumstantial, and he confirms that the material was missing from his file. Bravo Team in position. Frosted windows, limited joy. Stand by. We're five minutes away. That one's Ed. You see the cuffs? I've got the suspect. I could take him right now. We don't fire on a thermal image. We need to see the guy for real. Okay. Boss calls Scorpio? First shot's mine, on the glass. You're a split second later on the subject, as soon as you've confirmed it's him. Copy that. So the case against this guy, what'd you have on him? You name it. Well, that's what I'm asking. Hey, who's on trial here? I'm not the one waving the gun around. Okay, but my guys are in there facing a gun because this kid came after you, and I'd kind of like to understand what it is that's pissing him off. You need me, I'll be outside calling my attorney... Sir, you do not leave that hallway. You stay with security. I may have more questions. Hey, Jules, get Michael's lawyer back on the phone. Let's find out what this Cheznik isn't telling us. I'm on it. Alpha team, what's going on? Where are you? We're two minutes away from deadline. It's gonna be tight. So you sat up there and you told your story and, what, you thought the jury would believe you? That's a good boy, Eddie. Just keep walking him back till he's right underneath the balcony. They did. Until Cheznik puts some guy on the stand, some guy that'd been in a holding cell with me for five minutes. And he gets up there and he tells the jury that I confessed to him. That I told him that I killed her. Is there anything in Michael's file that shows wrongdoing on the part of the prosecution, anything at all? No. Anything that might've incriminated Cheznik is gone. What about other cases this guys prosecuted? I'll need some time. So this guy says that you confessed to him. What did you say? Nothing. Not a word, not even a hello. And that's what you told the jury? Yeah, but this guy, he knew stuff about how she died. Things that only the killer would know. Things that I didn't even know. Talk to me, Lewis. Almost there. Ed, one minute till the shooter's deadline and Alpha needs more time. You need to buy us more time. So that's why you wanted the file. But none of it was there. Okay? Cheznik made sure of that. All right, you have got to forget about Cheznik. Okay, and confronting him at gunpoint is not gonna convince anyone of anything. If you're innocent, put the gun down. A gun never solved anything. Believe me. The police are probably out there right now with a sniper. I know how they work.So, I'm asking you-- I am begging you, I am begging you-- just put the gun down. - No, it's over. - No. You get over next to him and put your hands up. Now! Spike, he's escalating. Where are you? 15 seconds away. That's not good enough. Now. I need you now. I need you now. Bravo Team has it. No, I don't wanna go lethal. I don't want to go lethal. Alpha Team, I'm watching you. Are you set? Your time is up. - We're set, boss. - Go, go, go. Police! Put the gun down now! - Put it down now! - Drop the weapon! You okay? You're okay. You're okay. He's got her. He's got her, he's got her. They're clear. They're safe. - Come on, come on. - They're safe. You son of a bitch. Okay, where's the subject? Where's, uh... Where's Michael Jameson? That's why I looked up. I didn't know. You're all right. You're okay. Cuffs off. Get these cuffs off. You did great. Are you okay? I'll be all right when that kid gets out of there. I've been on the phone with his lawyer. The kid was right, the case was a disaster. What do you mean, a disaster? Get a load of this. If you won't let me talk to Cheznik then give me a tape recorder. Subject turns to suicide. 12:11 PM. Michael's asked for a tape recorder. All right, Lewis. Just take it easy, just talk to him. Okay, it's coming. It's coming. They're working on it. All right? Please, stay calm, all right? If you could lower that gun a few inches... - No, they...still won't let me go. - That's him. Are you listening to me? Make sure it's recording. What did I just say? What did I just tell you? Excuse me, sir, if I could just talk to you for a second, I gotta get back in there. Well, they got you out. What's going on? Listen, I've got to call you back. If I could just get this straight. So it's a young girl who was raped and murdered, and the public was looking for somebody to hang, right? They always are. And the only real suspect is this kid, and all you got on him is circumstantial? - Are we picking this up? - Yeah. Nobody's gonna want to take that case. That's right. It's a no-win. So, you do what it takes to make the case. You know what? I get it. The system's rigged against the good guys. You do what you gotta do. I hear you. Like, like... give an informant the details of a murder, that kind of thing? How many years did you knock off this guy's sentence? 'Scuse me. What about the eight other cases you used jailhouse informants to get "confessions"? Get your hand off me. Happily. I make no apologies for what I did. Those were good cases. They were tough cases. No one else could've gotten those convictions. They knew that, that's... That's what? Why they made you a senior prosecutor, a month after that kid went to jail? Hey, Ed. Nice work. Is what he said enough to nail him? No. No, but the whole thing might be enough to get this kid an appeal. Jules is working on it. I'm going in to tell him. Boss, I... Let me have the vest. Okay? Ed, you can't just keep putting yourself in the middle of this thing. That's not how we work, you know that. What is this? You think this is some way to atone, you save this kid, you get to take it all back? I'm not trying to take it back. Ed. Eddie. Okay, this is Strategic Response Unit officer Ed Lane. You're a cop? Yes, I am. I need you to listen to me. I got Cheznik, on record, admitting that he would do whatever it took to get a conviction. Your lawyer says there may be as many as eight similar cases. With the evidence he has, it's enough for an appeal. So, just... just put the gun down, okay? Nobody dies today. Nobody dies today, okay? What you... what you were saying about... going over something in your brain? Yeah? In prison, I went over a lot of things. But there was this one thing that I... I kept asking myself over and over. I asked myself why Katie didn't want me to drop her at home that day, why she wanted me to drop her at the corner. She didn't love me. She wanted me to drop her at the corner because she was meeting someone else. She had a date. Oh, my God. Whoever she was meeting, that's who killed her. It had to be. I promised her, the first time I went to her grave, that I would prove I was innocent-- not for myself but for her. So they'd start... they'd start to look for him, whoever he is. So justice would be done. I promise you... we're gonna make sure that happens. And you will get your appeal. Nobody dies today, okay? That's it. Put your hands on your head. You know, you never told me your name. My name's Michael Jameson. Michael Jameson. It's all right. - You all right? - I'm good, good. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly presents</font> -=http://sfile.ydy.com=-
