Oh, come on. Nice. Okay, we're gonna hit the briefing room and then we're gonna patrol in air conditioned comfort. Have I told you recently how much I really do love you? Hello, boys. Jules. - How do manage to stay so fresh? - I think cool thoughts. Kira, we're gonna hit the streets. Team two's gonna hit rexdale. Sergeant rangford. That's, uh, Mr. Rangford to you, sir. Hey, don't call me "sir," I work for a living. - How're you doing, Daniel? - I'm doing fine. - It's good to see you, Greg. - Good to see you, too. You look good. What're you doing haunting the barn? A day like today you should be out - hitting the golf course. - What are you kiddin' me? You been out there? You don't call, you don't write... Eddie! How you doin'? Fine. Fine. - So? How's Sophie and Clark? - They're good. They're all good. Yeah. Sru. Spike! You still wear the rookie badge? Nunh-unh. This is Sam Braddock. - He's new but he's trying. - Good to meet you. I'm Danny. Hot call, team one. Gear up! What do we got? Suspicious package. Train station, south terminal. Babycakes, I'm comin'! Let's go. Hey, danny! Keep the peace, boys. - Who called it in? - <i>A security guard.</i> He says the suitcase has been there almost an hour. Copy that. We gotta keep that perimeter wide, we gotta keep it locked down. - Hey, who was the guy at the station? - Danny Rangford. Most decent, honest cop I ever met in my life. The guy's a legend, retired about a year ago. - He's the guy that brought me into SRU. - Yeah? Yeah. Him and Barney Fletcher. The two of them.</i> They fought to have us trained in psychology and negotiation. If it wasn't for them, we'd be straight-up SWAT. - So he was commander? - Never made it passed sergeant. Avoided promotion. - Why? - Keeps you in the action. I thought maybe it was the booze. You didn't smell it off him? - You new? - Three weeks. Uh, look, do you know if anyone's using the briefing room in the next while? Mm, I don't think so Team three's going off shift, team one's out. Good. I just wanna get a few things in order. Is it okay if I use the room? - Go ahead. - I'm just gonna have a walkabout first. That okay? Mm-hmm. Strategic response unit. Okay. - Morning, sergeant. - Inspector Stainton. What's the word? We're not liking this. There's been a spike in terrorist chat last two weeks. Station sees over 200,000 commuters a day. I'd say it has "hot spot" written all over it. Sam, north containment. - Lewis, west - Copy. Wordy, east Spike, do your thing Jules, second the boss. Stay connected. We're gonna need everyone's brain on this one. Let's get to know our friend. Kira, can I trouble you a sec? Mm-hm. There's a file I've been meaning to look at. A file? Yeah, it's number 5512, you'll find it under team four, 1989. Okay. What's this in regard to? Ah... Just getting a presentation together. You know. Old boys on a lecture circuit. Uh, it's probably not on the computer. Uh, look, if it's any trouble. I can always go down to the archives myself. Oh no, no. It's no trouble. I just need to clear it with Commander Holleran. Uh... What do you need to do that for? Oh, I just can't release files without permission. It's policy. Uh, well, it's not like it's a breach of uh... Anyone's privacy. I mean, it was a case of my own. I was there. Sorry, but officially you're a civilian now, so... No. You don't need to do that. Look. The old days, one of us at the desk... We'd have looked the other way. Hm? Huh? - Well, I'm sure commander Holleran... - You're not hearing me. I didn't come this far... - Stay quiet, mm? - But I can just</i> No. Just stay quiet and look down. Hm? I need that file. Do you understand? Yep. Let's go, darlin'. 10:36 am, suspicious suitcase. Constable scarlatti initiating electronic counter-measures. I'll wait here, you go in and get the file. Fast is good. Wait. I'll take that. Sorry. Okay, I know the subject, anticipate the weapon, target the solution. What kind of person plants a bomb in a public place? Organized personality, not impulsive,</i> not mentally incompetent... Emotionally detached, above-average intelligence... Access to volatile material, and familiar with its use. Yeah, and who wants to strike the city's transportation hub. Or just doesn't like tourists. Okay, everyone, eyes and ears open. We may be dealing with an individual who likes to hang around and watch the carnage.</i> It wasn't supposed to go this way, you know? Wasn't supposed to go this way. You could've just given it to me. All I needed to do was, go in the briefing room, get a little work done, undisturbed. I'll make sure you're not interrupted. Maybe you're not trained for this at your desk, but where I came from we're trained to profile people and here's what I get from you: you're ambitious, you're serious about your job, you don't wanna be passive, be perceived as the victim. So here's what you'll do: I walk into that briefing room, you'll sound the alarm first chance you get. I try walking out of here, same problem. Man with a gun, making unorthodox demands. - You see my dilemma? Smile. - <i>Hey, kira.</i> Any word on the air conditioning? Tomorrow. Sergeant Rangford? Troy! - You hear? I made sergeant. Team three. - Huh. - So you haunting the old barn? - Yeah. Sit down. Sit, sit. Okay, confirming no visible identification. Babycakes is sending out a signal blocking remote detonators. I'm gonna start with the infrared. Good news so far. Nothing unusual in the heat patterns. Gonna try chemical detection for any nerve agents, blood agents...</i> - Sergeant? - Inspector, anything good? Some of the people that reported the case said they smelled hay nearby. So? Hay... Moist hay. One woman said she smelled freshly cut grass. Stainton, so what're you sayin'? That someone stuffed the case with hay? Boss? Hay and grass aren't the only things that smell like hay and grass. Those people that smelled hay and grass, track them down. They gotta be put under medical observation immediately! No physical exertion, or it'll accelerate the spread. - Spike, what do think it is? - <i>Phosgene.</i> It could be phosgene. By the time you smell it, it's already at its lethal level. So, daniel, You and Michelle finally gonna take that round-the world trip she kept asking for? Well... Ah, maybe. - Little hot in that? - Mmm. Yeah. You know what? No, I-i'm good, I'm good. Anything I can help you with there, daniel? I'm fine, Troy. I'm really fine. I just wanna be left alone, okay? I don't think that's a good idea. Stand down. Stay back. - <i>Stay back.</i> - <i>Hey! Sergeant?</i> Keep it cool, guys. Everything's okay. Okay, Troy, you're gonna keep your boys at a distance. - Sure. Sure, Daniel. - You know how this works, boys. Kira? Kira, did you try to transmit? - What's up, jules? - I don't know. This is not the way it was supposed to happen, you know? - Never is, right? - No. Look at me. I'm the subject. You don't have to be, Daniel. We can work this out.</i> Sorry, Troy. Wait, she's sending something through. Sarge. Kira? Kira, you copy? Jules, you're in charge. Lean on Stainton if you need to. Eddie, we got a priority call. I need you, Sam and Wordy to come with me. Lewis, you cover Spike. Jules, let's get extra uniforms and detectives. Copy that. I'm on it. Ed, the priority call? It's at the station. - Why don't you tell me what's... - Don't... Negotiate me. Okay? Now... I'm gonna go in here, i'm gonna shut the door. I'm barricading myself in. You understand what that means, don't you? I do. And you're gonna leave me to my own devices. Otherwise, the situation is gonna get dangerous. You know that, right? Right. I want you to consider me a threat level red. - You got that? - I got it, boss. I'm gonna stop talking now. Threat level red. Can you say that for me? Threat level red. That's good. You're doing a good job, Troy. Transcript ==http://www.ragbear.com==- Synchro: Bistro for www.u-sub.net</font> Flashpoint Season 2 Episode 3 Haunting the Barn</font> It's Daniel Rangford. He's armed and has barricaded himself in the briefing room.</i> - <i>Boss.</i> - <i>Talk.</i> - <i>He's got a beretta. 40 cal.</i> - Panels hold up to that? - Yeah, yeah, they're polycarb. - So what's he doin' in there? He disabled a security camera. He hasn't talked since he shut himself in there. Classified himself a threat level red, negotiated me like I was a rookie. Are you surprised? - Can your team cover the entrances? - Yeah. We're all we got, though. Most of my guys already clocked out. Yeah, we're down three. The rest of us are dealing with the bomb threat. You want me to call my guys back in? Eddie... Boss. We keep this in the family. We can handle it. Okay, eddie. Nobody gets in through the front. Garage access only. I'm assuming he's closed the blinds, but we still need eyes in. So grab some rangefinders, go outside, double-check. Copy that Wordy? He's gonna be looking for the snake, so let's use the fiber cam. Got it. Auto-transcriptor, boss? - We don't need it. - Jules has it anyway. - It can just be for us, or... - Or what, Greg? We can decide that when this thing is over, okay? All right. Let's use team three's. You set it up. But call his wife first. Her name is Michelle. Let's figure out what's been going on at home lately, okay? - On it. - 'kay. I want you to talk to him. Okay? None of us can stay objective. But you know him best. Yeah. All right, good. Kira, walk with me. - So what do we know about phosgene? - It's not hard to make and it's nasty. It could take 24 hours to show symptoms. So your victims don't even know they've been exposed... Until their lungs stop working. Okay, well Stainton's on top of the med reports. I'll tell him to alert his units for a potential chemical evac order. Maybe we need to block incoming trains as well. Anything else?</i> Get him to broaden the perimeter, especially downwind. Got it. Okay, babycakes, let's take a look inside. Danny? What's this I'm hearing about you being in there with a gun? Huh? Tellin' Troy it's threat level red? Danny, come on. Last time we talked threat level red was code for "there's a wife in the station." It's just me out here, Danny. It's Eddie. Kira, what happened? He seemed fine when we left. - I mean, how did he seem to you? - Calm, at first. Well, sweating a lot. Yeah, well, we all are, right? But steady eye contact, relaxed posture, chatty... Then, when I wouldn't get the file for him, he came off the rails, like that wasn't the plan. What do you think the plan was? ??? Getting the file, preparing a presentation in the briefing room. He wanted privacy. Think he wanted to leave the station with that file? No, I don't think so. And he didn't want Holleran alerted? That's right. Remember anything about the file? Name on it was Gehring. 1989. '89. So there's no computer backup. Anything about that case? Just that it was his. Sorry. No, no, you did everything right, Kira. Thank you. You can go home. You're free to do that. Hey, I'm not going anywhere. I'm a cop too. Okay. Put on a vest and radio. Call Harvey Silver. His name and number's on file. He was on daniel's team, they retired the same year. Tell him we need him here sooner than asap. - Eddie, how's our friend? - He's not talking. I got eyes in. Fiber optic neutralized. - Troy, you got eyes outside? - <i>He's moving.</i> Looks like he's closing the shutters. Wanna try the ball cam? He's gonna be looking for that. Let's get thermals. Okay, I got it right here. Danny? You sticky my fiber optic camera? Nice job. What'd you use, duct tape? Forgot how much you liked it low tech. Remember that corner store barricade? Day like today. Hotter than hell. You remember that? You had me talk to those kids for an hour and a half, danny. Then you came in, turned up the heat, 20 minutes later, they came running out. And that was low tech all the way. - <i>Thought you were on a bomb call, Ed.</i> - <i>We're on it.</i> Just came back here to see what was going on.</i> I'm not here to negotiate you, Danny. I just wanna help you figure it out. All you've done for me over the years? - <i>Come on.</i> - <i>Back to your bomb call.</i> Spike's on it. Danny, you know the bomb guys! You know what's good for you, you stay out of here.</i> I'm not going anywhere. I'm gonna stay right here, long as it takes.</i> Danny, what're you saying to me? How long? Oh, uh... About 14 more ounces. 11:27 am barricaded subject Daniel Rangford.</i> Boss, how do you want me to characterize the subject?</i> Barricaded. Leave it at that. - You talk to his wife? - <i>Yes. I called her,</i> I told her husband was at the station, she got really upset she hung up on me. SRU! Boss, come and see this. ... ow! Eddie? He's shooting at nothing. He's shooting at a chair. I got thermals. - <i>On the ground!</i> - Danny! On the ground! Danny, our weapons are not raised! We are not here to hurt you. Down! Down! Danny, talk to me! Danny, it's Greg Parker. What's going on, buddy? What're you shooting at?</i> What's going on? He's shooting at somebody who's not there. - Is it an hallucination? - Yeah, maybe a flashback or something. - Where's Daniel? I wanna see him! - Ma'am, I'm sorry! What the hell is going on, guys? No one through the front. Ma'am, you cannot go in there. Sam. Sam, it's okay. Michelle... - I wanna see him. Where is he? - Let's just walk over here for a second We can talk about it over here. Where is he? I wanna see him. You bastard! You bastard! You did this to him! All of you! You bastard! Just calm down. It's okay, it's okay. Just go with kira and we'll find you a place to sit down, okay? And I promise I will come to you as soon as I can, okay? Michelle, let's sit down. It's gonna be okay. Boss,take a look. All right, that's enough. I'm gonna open it up. He said he was gonna fire You wanna spend the rest of your life thinking about what we should've done? Okay. Wordy, cover. Sam, we're opening up. 'Kay,? Go. I told you not to come in! - Let's slow this down, danny. - Close the damn door! I'm not gonna be able to do that, dan. One step closer? We're done. - Okay. - Let the subject set the pace, huh? Don't rush a negotiation. 'Cause I'm not finished here and I'm gonna get this thing right. Okay, eddie? Okay. Back off. Boss. I'll go talk to Michelle. I think he's slowing up, so let's just keep him on his timetable, okay?</i> Okay. Arriving now. Harvey, I'm Sam, team one. - Where is he? I wanna see him. - That's not gonna happen. I gotta talk to him. He'll listen to me. - Harvey, this isn't a good idea. - This is, this is garbage. I can't just stand here. There's not a guy here who feels different, but we just need to streamline the inputs a little, okay? Ed lane is with him now. - Eddie's with him? - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay? Good. We need your help. We need you to remember everything you can about the Gehring incident, 1989. This is not good. We got a possible I.E.D. Batteries, wire, pipe... Is that shrapnel? Could be. It's not nails or ball bearings</i> some kind of small objects though. This thing could be on a timer, it could be motion-sensitive, - <i>so we're not taking it anywhere.</i> - We detonate it here, in the square? Negative. Detonating will only release more gas. We do a render-safe with a water cannon. Okay. We gotta disrupt the mechanism. And turn the phosgene into hydrochloric acid.</i> I promise you'll see him as soon as we know it's safe.</i> Safe? Michelle, we need to understand what he's doing, where he's coming from. - Can you help us? - Yeah. 'course I'll help. Thank you, 'cause I'm... 'cause you're the one who knows him best. You think? I know the guy I married. I remember him. This guy? I mean, I was counting the days 'til he retired. 'til he came back to us - To me and Liam. Wake up to the world, have a bbq, put up his feet Enjoy. Something. - Didn't work out that way, huh? - No. 'cause when he took off the uniform... It turns out there was nothing left underneath. Almost there. All right, we just gotta get past the part of him that sticks to a plan. So... Maybe we bypass the logic brain, force him to run out of there. Thinking about tear gas? The animal instinct in the midbrain thinks it's drowning, running for air. - Well, I don't recommend it. - Why's that, danny? You'd have to evacuate the whole building for 3 days, just to breathe in here... And 3 weeks with a sanitation crew. We're not worried about making messes, danny. Think it through, boys. You wanna cripple the SRU? All on the gamble that I didn't think of uh, packing a gas mask in this bag? Does he let you touch him? No he doesn't. And I don't mean just in bed. I try to hold his hand, he pulls away. The last time he touched me, I woke up with his hands around my neck and he was screaming at me. He's been hanging off a cliff all these years.</i> He won't talk to me. Not about work, he never has. And he won't talk to you 'cause he knows... You'll shake your heads, "oh, so sad to see the great guy fall. What happened to him? We thought he could hack it?" Then you'll turn your backs, so that you can keep on pretending that he's the exception. Michelle, it's gonna be okay. It's okay. Danny, we are not playing chess here now. You're thinking about a permanent solution to a temporary problem. - I appreciate your faith, ed, but... - All right, then you gotta appreciate - Don't interrupt the subject! - Don't "handbook" me, Danny. Danny, faith is what you need when there is no proof.</i> We don't need faith to know that you deserve to live. Oh yeah? That's something you can prove? Yeah. Yeah, I think I can. Let's talk about all the people whose lives were made longer because of you. Don't start. The Gehring incident, it was a home invasion Regent Park, but this little place was neat as a pin. You know who's keeping house? A little 18-year-old girl. Parents are both deadbeats, one's in jail, one's awol... She's holding it all together, looking after her little brother and sister. What happened with the home invasion? By the time we got on-scene, bad guys had gone, the girl, she'd taken a whack at one of the guys with a baseball bat, scared 'em away. So, team went back out on patrol and Danny and I stayed behind to write it up. That was it? The little guy, 10-years-old, he wanted to show us his baseball card collection. I said "no, we gotta go," and Danny said "no, let's stay." He just bought a fresh pack for his own son, went out to the truck to get them. We sat crossed legged on the floor... Middle of the afternoon, summer day Trading baseball cards with the little guy. It was good. You remember this pretty clear for such a long time ago. Yeah, well, you would. Two hours later it wasn't our file anymore, it was homicide's. That little girl down by the dock. You remember her? She was turning blue, she could hardly breathe.</i> You did mouth-to-mouth on her in the ambulance,</i> all the way to the hospital. Buddy, you saved her life. You stayed with her the whole time and then they called from the hospital To say "congratulations, she's gonna live." Danny, you got the silver shield for that, buddy. Proudest friggin' 9 seconds of my career. 'Cause then they give you the punchline...</i> Which is something we don't tell the rookies... About how the girl was brain damaged from lack of oxygen. Oh yeah, she's gonna live Like a vegetable, shriveling up, until her family decides to pull the plug to put her out of her misery. Which I gotta say, seems to be a good idea right about now. Danny... Danny. I know you're self-esteeming me like crazy here, but you know what? That's the last thing I need right now. That's the last thing. - Excuse me. - Okay, Danny. All right, let's take a break. He's almost at the bottom of that bottle.</i> The more we talk the faster he drinks. Let's just... Take a little pressure off, okay? - Boss, i'm not gonna leave him. - All right, you stay. You stay, but let him do his thing. I need to find out what's going on in that file. Okay. - We got the homicide file yet? - Squad car's flying it over. Give you a deadline? Yeah, what's left of his bottle of scotch. Harvey, what do you remember? Two victims... Older sister, younger boy. Perps got away. Tragic as hell, but it's nothing we don't see. Yeah, but why did this one get to him? What was different about it? - Did you ever talk to him about it? - I don't know. You know how it goes? - I might've asked him how he was doing? - And what'd he say? "I'm fine." "I'm fine." Inspector, we're getting ready to cannon the package here. - No one comes close. - Perimeter is locked up. Thanks. Danny, you thirsty at all in there? Huh? Danny? A little water, buddy. Just gonna roll it in there, okay? No surprises. Nice and easy. Incoming from homicide Gehring, Jeremy, august 8th 1989. - August 8th? - That's today. - <i>Find out why.</i> - We got witness tape. All right, dig out a vcr. Let's get some answers. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. It's beta. Aw, he's almost finished that bottle. I'm gonna open it up. - Are you sure? - Yeah, we need more access. Sam, I need you. Troy, grab your guys. We're gonna open this up. What's happening? Michelle, I need you to stay out of range. I won't hide in there anymore. He's my husband. You know what? You're right. You're right, I want you to come with me, I want you to hide behind the shields, and I want you to stay close. All right, we ready? We ready? Sam? Danny, listen to me now. Danny, danny, don't do it. - <i>Don't do it!</i> - <i>Danny, put the gun down!</i> Danny, Michelle's here. - <i>Daniel.</i> - Michelle? What're you doing? You can't be here? Get outta here! - You shouldn't be here! - I'm not going anywhere, daniel. - Get her out of here! - <i>I'm not going anywhere!</i> - Don't make me do this in front of her! - Danny, just listen to me now. Get her out, get her out of here! Danny, put that gun down. We're not leaving you, Danny! We're not leaving you. Come on! In five... Four... Three... Two... One. Fire in the hole. Hold fire. Hold fire. - Daniel! Please! - <i>Michelle, he's not gonna hurt me.</i> He's not gonna hurt me. Are you, Danny? I'm crossing the line. You think I won't do it? Cardinal rule. Gun's pointed at an officer. Hmm?! Sometimes you gotta break the rules, Danny. Remember? Remember who taught me that? I'll do it. I'll do it. - I have the solution. - Wordy, dammit, go. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey-hey. No-no-no, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You know what you gotta do? You gotta keep safe. You ever seen this before? Do you have any idea? No. You gotta hide. It starts here. I didn't want jeremy to find it. He told me to stay under the bed. So I didn't see them. But do you think they might've been the same...</i> The same men that had come before? Don't know why they came back 'cause he said we'd be okay. - Who said you'd be okay, petra? - The policeman with the baseball cards. He said... He said we'd be okay. Then he went away.</i> But he didn't know that they'd come back, petra.</i> But maybe he did. Because... Because he told Jeremy. What do you mean "he told jeremy"? He said, "you know what you gotta do? You gotta be brave and show your sisters." And so Jeremy wanted to be brave so he could save me and my sister. But it didn't work. It didn't work. Boss, we got something. Home invaders came back, boy stepped up to protect his sisters, Daniel and his team were done, daniel didn't do anything wrong, it was something he told the boy. Yeah. "You know what you gotta do? You gotta hide." No, that's not what he said. He said, "you know what you gotta do?</i> You gotta show your sisters you're brave." What was the boy's name? Jeremy. Okay, thanks. You hide, like... Daniel? Daniel? Michelle, you gotta go. - You can't see this. - Daniel, I'm not leaving you! Daniel, let's talk about Jeremy. Jeremy? The file you wanted. Guessing it was about Jeremy, right? 'cause today's the day. Isn't it? August 8th? It's funny, those days that stick in our minds. I'm guessing that jeremy was a pretty brave kid, but...</i> I don't know that for sure, could you help me out with that one? Daniel? Danny, you can't do this. You can't do this without... Without telling us why! I know... I know... About a kid... Sitting on the floor. I went back. He didn't look any different from the last time I saw him. His eyes are open, he's looking at me, Baseball cards spread around him. But he's real quiet. He's real still, and I'm thinking, "Why is he so still? Why doesn't he say "hi"?"</i> And then I see it... An eight-inch screwdriver buried into his throat. - And I put it there. - You didn't put it there, Danny. - Criminals put it there. - <i>If I hadn't been called there,</i> - I wouldn't have said that to him. - "You gotta be brave for your sisters." If it wasn't me, he, he would've lived. You don't know that, buddy. Danny. I spent my whole career screwing up. Being too late, being too... Early, not saying the right words. I spent my whole career... Looking at the worst 20 minutes of other people's lives and I can't take it anymore. Danny, how about remembering the good stuff? The good stuff, all the lives you saved, all the people whose lives were made better, their lives were made longer because you were there for those 20 minutes. I can't remember. You see? I can't remember. I can't remember! All I see are the ghosts. All I got are the ghosts, the ghosts, and I can't take it any more. - <i>Daniel!</i> - Eddie... Please. Please help me. Pull the plug. - Pull the plug. - Okay, Wordy. Okay? Danny, this... This isn't about Jeremy. These guys think it's all about him, but it's more than that. Isn't it? Jeremy's just... Who you always think about. I get it. I get it. You know what, buddy? Every time... Every time I look out that damn scope,</i> I see a kid runnin' across, I see a spray of blood... And you know what else, danny? You know what else I see? All the calls we didn't get to in time. The mothers that we couldn't talk down The kid who thought it'd be fun to pull a gun on a cop. You're not the only one who sees ghosts, Danny. I gotta tell ya, I don't know where to put 'em anymore either. Eddie, please, no. You taught me everything I know. You made me who I am, Danny. You can't... You can't tell me... That this is how it ends. You can't. Give me the gun. No... You'll be okay. Stand down. Stand down. - It was harmless. - He just wanted to keep us busy. Inspector Stainton, those witnesses are free to go. Hay and grass. I'm gonna take you to a place, a place I've been myself. And we're gonna get through this. We're gonna get through this. * and if I don't make it home tonight * * don't leave it up to me again * * to feel fine * * and if I don't make it home all right * * give me the day or so * * to rest my mind * * but isn't that the way * * you tell me everything's all right * * I stay up all night * * and, baby, when you tell me that it's me this time * * I don't close my eyes * * I sacrifice a little peace of mind * * is love like this always? * * is love like this always? * I thought we were gonna keep this one in the the family?
