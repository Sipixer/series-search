Used them on the recruits this morning. You got training flashbangs? Sure. Just open the doors a little first. Reduce the concussive effect. I like it, let's do it. Okay, the elevator has two emergency override patterns: A ground floor And a nearest floor cycle pattern. Dropping down a floor, we'll deploy from above. Sam, lou, meet and greet when the doors open.

The gas in the media room? I think we got another option. Talk to me, lou. How close can we get to the subject? You gonna answer that? You know, you don't seem like the kind of guy. What kind of guy? The kind of guy who makes his point with a gun. And what would you know about that? In my line of work, you meet a lot of people, You get a sense. You know, i got two kids. My buddy lorne has two kids. They went out for a drive today, Cross-Country, To go live in a house that smells like other people. They got to watch their dad sell everything that they owned For less than what you pay for a business brunch. Do you think about what kind of guy lorne was Before you sold out his family's future? No one's accountable. We're all just pieces of paper crossing his desk. He sells a piece of paper and we lose everything. And that's what happened to stan too? Brian and me worked at the plant 11 years 'Til it closed 5 months ago. Stan lives on brian's street. We've all been buddies a long time. Brian thought... He was doing us a favour. Here's these amazing mortgage deals. And he talked you and stan into it? Me and carol. Carol is stan's wife? Late wife. Now, stan... Stan fixed his place up with his own hands. Did it for carol. Did it to give her the home she always dreamed about. Then one day they get a letter in the mail, Her payments have been tripled And there's no way they can pay. Their pension's already... decimated. What're they gonna give up? Heating? Groceries? She sees it's coming, right? All he put into it, all he did for her, It's all gonna be gone. But she can't bring herself to tell him, So she hides it, right? And hides it... And one day, she's out of time. Makes no sense. I mean... you love someone, you stick around, You fight, but... She couldn't. He comes home after work one day And he finds her... He finds his wife. That wasn't a great day. You really think graves is gonna care? Or you just want him to see what he's done? We want him to see the people he's wrecked, up close. We want his face on camera saying, "I made this choice, I sold out a thousand families For the price of my $22,000,000 dollar bonus, I knew what i was doing and i did it anyway And i'm sorry." Okay. Constable. Eddie, i need to stay here with stan. That's all it'll take! I want you to meet the elevator to start negotiating. You catch that conversation i had with my friend, lorne? Yeah, i copy. Okay. Spike, start the override procedure. Okay, listen to me, please. No, you listen to me. You are gonna do this, do you understand me?

And i gotta tell you right out of the gate, I'm sympathetic. Laid off from the auto plant five months ago. Lost his house to foreclosure. No listed address. No family. We got a lot of people here who are very sympathetic. They understand exactly what it is you're going through. No, they don't. They don't. Yeah, they do. No, they don't. That's why we're going in there with the cameras, And he's gonna say what he's done. That's what we're here for. I get that, brian. Okay, i get that. When i was a kid, I saw my folks go through the very same thing. You feel helpless. You get it? Then you get why this guy has to go in there And own up to what he's done. Where is he? What do you want, stan? Why aren't you letting him through? Brian and lorne... They want to make things right again. Lorne wants a house for his family, I get that. But what do you want from joel graves? I want him in here. You know what i think you really want? What you really want, you know he can't give it you. You know he can't bring it back. Lou, you gotta hurry, You gotta hurry, lou. Okay, copy. On our way. Don't try to stop me. I owe this. I owe this to carol. To carol? Stan's wife. "Recession suicide." He found her in the garage. She had her good coat on. Her good coat, like she was going somewhere. She left a note on the hood of the car 'Cause she couldn't tell him. And she, she thought she let him down. I hear you. That's not right. That's not right. Yeah, it's not right. It's not right. You hear me? You get it? Then you let me through. Now, listen to me, brian. In this job, i hear a lot of people Asking for a lot of crazy things, And what you're asking for, it's not crazy. It's not. It's just not something... It's not something that we can do, okay? We can't do it like this. You know, i get it. I get it. You just, you just wanna do right by your friends. You just wanna do right by stan. Brian, stan is down there right now, Doused gasoline, with a lighter, And he's gonna light himself on fire. No. No. Now, i know you've lost a lot, But you don't want to lose stan too. So i'm asking you, Show him that this isn't the way. Just show him that there's another way to end this. Okay? Please? Please. Thank you. Weapon's down. Weapon's down. Thank you. Thanks. And i know how hard it is to lose someone. To lose someone you love, To lose something that's so important to you And have it ripped out of your life. You got ten seconds. This isn't the way, stan.

Thank you, you did the right thing. You did the right thing. Mr. Graves. Hi. What do you have to tell us about today? Hi, uh... i'm joel graves and... In response to today's events, I'd just like to say a few words, Um... I'm moved by the losses of these men. Eddie... And i understand the need to turn to someone For an explanation. What these men lost was more than four walls and a roof, But that's the part that i took from them. It made sense on paper, but up close... It's a different story. Let's go. Up close... it's not the same, I'm sorry. Stan, i'm sorry. If there's anything i can do to help? Mr. Graves! Mr. Graves! Well, he got up there, Came clean, said he was sorry, That's what you wanted, right? It's not enough. I know. I know, nothing's gonna take that pain away. Now he wants to help. How's he gonna do that? Being sorry gets him off the hook? "I wanna help" makes things better? What's he gonna do? Is he in the business of giving back lives? What about my wife? Just don't do it, stan. Just don't. Ready, serge. Go. Carol... Carol... carol... 12:16 p.M. Third subject, stan matthews, contained. You know what? She blew by everbydody in there.

This guy's going to jail 'Cause all he wanted to do was help out his two friends. I get it. Yeah? It's not black and white. Everyone's a constable here. There's no rising up in the ranks. You don't make more money Because you risk your life everyday, You make less. I know. Mm-Hmm. Not gonna be out in the field alone, You're gonna be in it with a team. I'm not gonna lie to you, If jules makes it back, she's got a place here. Fair. But that doesn't mean i won't put my faith in you. I'm not gonna let you down. Okay. Yeah? Okay? Yeah, let's keep the peace. Okay, let's do that. Thank you. You're welcome.
