Siu needs witness statements then see dr. Luria for a debrief. Braddock,come with me. Nice post-incident reflexes,guys. In the hostage taking that shook the downtown core,police confirm the hostage is unharmed, but is obviously shaken. According to reports,the gunman... blair kowalski,special investigations unit. How you doin'? Okay,let's start with the vest. I need your vest. Vest. Shirt. Boots. pants. You didn't wait. Just bagging the clothes. They say debriefing and you take it literally? Did you say anything? You don't have to say anything to him. That's your right,okay? Frank mcandrew,I'm your lawyer,all right? I'm gonna take care of all this. You have nothing to worry about,all right? Saw it on tv,that was great work. Kowalski,this is a no-brainer. No pun intended. Do you wanna talk to him now or what? Okay. What exactly do you mean,"he called scorpio"? He means he got the order. When you say you "got the order"... you gonna get that? It's okay,it's my wife. You can get that. If you want to get it,you can get it. It's your right to talk to your wife. Hey,soph. Nah,I can't talk. Okay,I just wanted to know if that was that your team this morning? Yeah. That was you? Yeah. Well,ah,we'll go home and wait for you there. No,no,no,just... you know what? Just go to the thing,okay? Okay,eddie. Bye. - So,picking up,when you say you "got- - You saw it,didn't you? Just give him the use of force wheel. This is textbook. Just,uh,just show him. Give it to him. When all reasonable efforts to de-escalate the situation fail and the suspect is threatening a member of the force, clearly progressing from "assaultive" to "grievous bodily harm", okay,there we have it! Okay? - Are we done here,mr. Kowalski? - Just about. Were you aware that the suspect's son was at the scene? My observer said there was a,uh,male youth. And do you believe that every effort was made to involve the son in the negotiation as a third party intermediary? Yes I do. And are you confident that all options were exhausted before the use of lethal force? What,the option of watching him shoot my teammate? I'll put that as a yes. So you know,this is the process: We investigate alongside the coroner's inquest and our director will deliver his statement as to whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that you or the other subject officer used excessive force. He knows the process. Until that time,you're under investigation. We recommend you take a break,spend some quality time with the family. - Thank you,blair. - Good. I'll see you at the inquest. Hold on,ed. There's somebody else that you gotta talk to. hey,mom. - Look... - I know,you're fine. You did a great job out there,but you need somebody to talk to. It's strictly confidential. doc,if you want a date,just ask. oh,you know what? Screw it. I forgot who I was talking to,for a minute. you're not that guy. You're not gonna wonder if you did the right thing. You're not going to have any sleepless nights,flashbacks,memory loss,time distortions. You're not gonna... feel alone,feel guilty. Feel guilty about not feeling guilty. that's what happens to other people,you'll be fine. You know where to find me. Not that you'll need to. ed,it's time. Code of silence been lifted? - Yeah. - So how'd it go? - The way they do. - Are you good? - Yup. - Yeah? Piece of gum? Minty fresh. Listen,I saw you up there. It was a clean shot. Yeah,it was. That guy knew what he was in for. You saved lives. What I'd tell ya? - Making the world safe so that others may eat pie. - Eat pie. That's right. Let's hope the stockholm syndrome kicks finast. Mr. Lane. You better have an outstanding reason for being late. Good job,son. And I am done. As you were. So we're gonna try this again. Uh,team one,this is sam braddock. Sam's gonna be joining you. Sam took his babysteps at 51st division. Went army and joins us straight from jtf 2. This is greg parker,he's the team sergeant. We've got rolie,lewis,wordy,spike,jules and ed lane as our team leader. - Nice shot. - Thanks. - Team's full,isn't it? - Actually,it's not. Rolie,your application's been approved.
