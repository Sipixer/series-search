There's some misunderstanding. He's only 17. You have got to get him out of there. - Wordy,how you doing? - I'm heading to the drops. Steer me in. With haste,gentlemen,with haste. Where do I start? He's had the year from hell. - Get out of my face. - It's over. Sierra 1 in position. Hold fire till my command. - I thought I could trust you. - Put the gun down. - Standing by for explosive entry. - Copy that. - Think I won't do it? - I know you won't do it. - Sierra 1... - I've got the solution. - Donnie,give it to me. It's over! - No! Scorpio. So that's it? That's the plan: Lethbridge? 5 hours eailier {a6}Jack said he can get me a job. {a6}What about the restaurant? Your dream,our dream. It'll pick up again,David. By $30,000? Just give it time. See this letter,Liz? Do you see where it says "Notice of eviction"? Don't talk to me like I'm a child. Well,stop acting like one. Face facts! The restaurant's a failure. So... whose fault is that? Don't you dare lay this at my feet. Well,I'm not the one dragging our family halfway across the country. Hey,Jules. Hey. - What are you doing here? - That's a nice way to say hi. I'm sorry. I didn't expect to see you. Glad you came by. Actually,I came to talk to the boss. Which... I should go. Hey,Jules,what's wrong? Nothing's wrong. You've been avoiding me all week. I have not been avoiding you all week. Yeah,you have,Jules. Sam,okay,I'm not going to do this here. Do what? Hey,do what? - When I return to the SRU... - Jules,we talked about this. We did? Me bringing it up and you changing the subject. That's not talking about it,Sam. Well,what's the point? The point is,when I return to the SRU, we have to talk about what happens then,okay? Now you're on shift,so let's talk tonight. Okay,I'll meet you at your place. Okay. We'll get a coffee or something. Okay,coffee. I can't stand being in this house anymore,man. I got to get out. Want to catch a movie? Nah,I'm not into it. Go to the mall. Sit outside Bikini Cabin. Come on,Donnie. What are you,like 12? Man,like you weren't into it when Tessa Price was there with the new belly button piercing? Oh,my God. - Meet me at the shop in ten. - All right. Hey,bud,Mom is out,so I thought that we'd have a talk. About moving 3,400 clicks away? I checked. I'm sorry you found out the way that you did. Well,what about school? And my friends? Aren't we just talking about Donnie? Why are you always ragging on him? Because it seems like your whole world revolves around this kid. I-I... I really don't think it's healthy. How about you just try expanding your horizons a little bit? Hey,where are you going? My horizons need expanding. So had to think fast,right? Like one of those times when you got to do what you got to do,right? So the subject comes running up screaming. I kick the door down,right? Spike didn't kick the door in. I did. And the subject wasn't screaming. Guys,you mind? I'm telling a story here,okay? So the subject comes out with this blade,Donna. And it's like this big. Wow,a sword. Okay,okay,maybe more like that. - A machete. - Yeah,sure,it was a machete. Donna... it was this big. Wh are you talking about this big? - I'm just saying it was... - What is that supposed to be? That's not even a letter opener. It doesn't matter about the size,Spike. What are you doing that? You know you shouldn't do that to a guy ever. Sam,you're late for workout. Sorry,sir. - No. - What do you mean no? I mean,no,you can't go. Like I have a choice? Look,my parents are broke or something. They're behind on rent. They're kicking us out. Then all we've got to do is find the money. Yeah,and how are we going to do that? I don't know. My dad's got some old vinyl. Maybe we could sell it online or something. Donnie,it's like 30 grand. There's no way. Dude,you can't go. You're the only non-jerk I know. Please,I'm already pissed off. Don't make it worse. You should be. We grew up here. This is our store. That's our mall. This is our life. They're going to throw it all away? Let's go. I need to chill. How you doing? I asked you a question,Sam. How you doing? Fine. I'm fine. - You look like crap. - Thanks. - But you're fine? - That's what I said. That's what you said. Oh,you're mirroring me,Ed? 'Cause I'm your teammate,not your subject. I know that,but if something's wrong, it's going to affect your performance; I need to know. I'm fine. Really. Hold up. Bro,what are you doing? Why are we stopping here? I want some cookies. You serious? They have them at the convenience store. Yeah,well,I like the ones they have here. Do you know how much they charge? They're like ten bucks. Yeah,dude,I know. I used to work here. That's how I got hooked on 'em. Why'd they fire you anyway? 'Cause they're jerks. I was totally awesome at that job,man,totally dedicated. The cookies are that way. No,no,they're up there now. What? I got so much work in the office. I'm never going home. That the guy that fired you? No. He's Ashton,the night manager. You know,after my dedicated service to this establishment, I think I deserve a parting gift. Can you not do this right now? Nylons? For my mom. Donnie... Let's hit the head. There's one in the back-- employees only. Just drop the stuff so we can go. Bathroom first. Come on. What?! We're not supposed to be here. Oh,easy,Grandma. It's almost closing time. No one's gonna be back here. In five minutes,the head teller's gonna give the deposit bags to Ashton. No. No,I do not want to hear this. Just listen. Ashton's going to bring the deposit bags down to the safe to be picked up later tonight by security. What are you saying? I'm saying we stop him. Jump out,grab the money. We run out that service door. It's easy. ****missing*** Your dad needs money,right? For rent? Dude,come on! Look,man. We're brothers,okay? And brothers are always there for each other. Five minutes and everything gets taken care of. Five minutes and you get everything you need. Some dude did the exact same thing a year ago. He made off with like 70K. Okay,whatever. It's still wrong. The store's insured. They don't care. D,stop. Stop and think a second. I have. And you can either step up and help, or you can turn your back and let me go out there alone. Dude,you know I'm not going to let you do that by yourself. So you're with me? You're with me. Give me the money! Come on!  Come on! Lose the stocking. Lose the stocking! Drop the bag. Drop it. Drop it! Come on! Come on! Help me! Donnie! Get him off! What the... what the hell?! What the hell did you do?! You wanted me to help you. Go. We're headed out the front door. We're just two customers walking out the front door. Nearly there. Like I said,there was two of them. A big guy in a black jacket. The other guy had a red coat. They were armed... That's them. We're done,man. It's over. It ain't over,bro.

I... It's all right,Adam. It's all right. Just slow him down,ay? Just slow him down. They tell you to say all that? - No,it was me. - I thought that was you talking.

So,it's your call, but I ink we got to let Adam talk to him again. - Hey,Sam,that gun goes up,it's over. - Copy. Donnie? What am I going to do? What am I going to do? Son,don't do it. Don't do it,son. Son? Look,Donnie,it's me. Just me. Listen,I don't care where we are-- in Lethbridge,in jail. Doesn't make a difference. But you do this,it's all over. Remember? We're brothers.

All right,tomorrow night. - Actually... - Tomorrow. Okay. That'd be good. Maybe they weren't meant to be. You know what? They never really looked like a couple to me. How'd you know there was something up? I figured it out. How'd you do that? Because I'm special that way. Yes,you are. Yes,you are. Let me buy you a soda. It's not if,it's when I'm going to go back on the team,Sam. Okay,so,the boss knows. Right,which is exactly why we can't be together if I'm gonna go back. You know that. I love you,Sam,but I've worked my whole life for this j and the team, and I'm not gonna let getting shot stand in the way of me going back. You mean I'm not going to stand in your way? Jules,that's the first time you told me you loved me. I didn't think it would be like this. - Sam... - Look,I get it. I get it. I do. Well,there's always the other choice if we want to stay together.
