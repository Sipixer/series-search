What are you dreaming about? This kind of reminds me that bus ride back from All-State. Nothing looks exactly the way I left it. Know what I mean? I've never been away before. Seems like something's different to me though. What the hell? Look at this guy. Let go! He just ran right in front of me. Are you all right? What the hell's wrong with your eyes? Let's go. - Wait, wait, where you going? - We gotta find Sam! It's almost time, man. Sync: mpm & Arrow What do you think? I think you've outdone yourself. Feathers. Perfection. I'm thinking more meat. Five more pounds of ground chuck? Think about who this is for. Let's aim higher. Corn-fed Kobe it is. You're finally getting it, Karl. I want the two of you to bring me the most expensive meat. Organs, kidneys, livers, anything you can find. You want us to go kill something so it's extra fresh? No, don't worry. I have other people bringing us something living to sacrifice. Any sign of anybody outside? No bug-eyes here. Just a hangover. Thanks for going over there. Station was totally empty. Cells were all wide open. They think I'm a bad cop. You should see the square. Looks like New York City or something. People banging their heads on posts. Graffiti everywhere. People pissing all over the sidewalk. This whole town's going down the crapper. Yeah, trust me, I know. I got no idea how we're going to deal with a goddamn maenad. A mae-what? Wait, you don't remember any of what I told you last night, before you passed out and spent the whole fucking day in bed, sleeping off your bender? You said... Maryann Forrester was to blame for all of this. The bug-eyes and the craziness. Yeah, and the people showing up dead with their hearts cut out. - In the back seat of your car? - She did that? She killed Daphne too. Fuck me. We got another serial killer. Listen. She is a supernatural creature. She is immortal. She has powers. And she's not leaving till she gets what she wants, which I think is me. What's she want you for? I think to cut my heart out while a bunch of naked people watch, all for... Dionysus or Satan, or some God who has horns. People thought I was crazy because I thought I saw a pig. Well, you did see a pig. And you were right. That pig was a part of all this. That pig was... doing some of Maryann's dirty work for her. Well, if what you say is true, we need to kill that bitch. She don't die, remember? Sam, come to Merlotte's. Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.</i> There's a mob. They've got Terry and they are coming for me next. I've already seen you all caught up in Maryann's weirdness. Jesus, I know, but she's after us now, and she's crazy. I mean, she is Hannibal Lecter crazy! And I'm scared she's gonna get my kids! And nobody's even picking up the phone</i> at the sheriff's office. All right. All right, I'll be right there. This is Jason Stackhouse. Just want to let y'all know a couple a folks got hit by a car up on the square. But they... They ran off. Ask them what the heck's going on all over town. And if somebody could call me back and tell me if we've been attacked by terrorists or what. Fucking answering machine at the sheriff's office. There's something seriously wrong in Bon Temps. I can feel it. If it ain't the vamper and his vamper lover. There's those fucking eyes again. Mother, come back here. Oh, thank God you're home. - She's gone, like, totally batshit. - What the devil...? I had nothing to do with it, I swear! At first I thought maybe it was just a bad reaction to her new diet pills... but practically the whole town's got these eyes. - How long has she been like this? - Since last night. And I will be, for as long as it takes for him to get his offering. That sounds fucking fucked-up. She's been on about Sam Merlotte and how they're gonna offer him to God. Offer yourself up to me, Jason Stackhouse. You... dirty... little... monkey. - Mama! - Does she ever calm down? Playing Wii gets her to focus. But I wouldn't call it calm. I'm gonna crack open your fucking skull, bitch! So she says God is coming? Yes, and that everybody's waiting at Merlotte's so they can catch Sam - and take him to Maryann's. - Maryann's? Where's that? Well, it's your house. What? They're gonna rip that boy open and serve him up like barbecue! Has anybody been attacked by something with claws? I heard Arlene say that that poor woman you found in Andy's car had her back scratched up pretty bad. And then I also heard somebody say that Daphne had some kind of weird scar on her back. - The new waitress at Merlotte's? - There's a new waitress at Merlotte's? We should talk to her. She's dead. She had her heart cut out just like the other one. - Fudge! - I'm going to Merlotte's and find out what the hell is happening on my turf. If this is the same creature we think it might be, you do not want to go anywhere near it, trust me. Mr. Compton, I ain't about to sit back and let monsters destroy my town. Jason, this would be one of those times to use your head. Oh, I am. I ain't never been so clear in my whole life. This here is the war I've been training for. He can take care of himself. We've seen that. Be careful, you hear? Drive straight up to Merlotte's, get inside as fast as you can, and do not go into the woods by yourself. I won't. - I mean it. - I know. Come here. And where's Tara? She's been partying pretty hard over at Mary... It's just something that people say. "Party over at Maryann's". - I gotta get over there. - After you. - Should I have gone with them? - And leave me alone here with her? No fucking way. You here? Empty. Like the sheriff's office. There's people here. I can smell them. Thank you, Sam, for coming so fast. I know how much punctuality means to you. Are you all right? I am now. Because soon he'll be getting what's his. Shit. Not this shit again. At least shoot the cheap liquor! Bottom shelf, bottom shelf! We call this move "stress inoculation." Fuck. - Come on. Back door. - They're getting away! Go get him! Follow me! I'll get you, Sam Merlotte! Hard! Cut his feet off! Freaks! Motherfucker! In here! In here! Damn it, this door don't lock from the inside! I can't hold it! Here. Okay, that'll do it. Hold up a second. We have our EPW right where we want him. And there ain't no place for him to go. - And what does that mean? - It means we have secured the target. Mission accomplished! Bodenhouse. Go call Maryann and tell her she can come pick him up. We are fucked. We're still alive. For now. What are we gonna do? Are we gonna have to kill them all? Even if we could, these are our friends and neighbors. And cousins. Right. We can't kill them. We are fucked. Yes, we are. Peanut? You sound nice. It burns where I'm tied up. It burns like fire, Mama. Tying her up's not making her better. I done told you, it's for her own good. Ours too. Tara, baby. Tell your mama what you need. Tara, you stronger than whatever this is and you know it. Now, get the fuck up out of there! If only Miss Jeanette were still alive. She don't need no damn backwoods witch. She need Thorazine and a padded cell. "Bless the Lord "Oh my soul "And all that is within me "bless His holy name "And forget not all His benefits "Who forgives "all your iniquities" "Who heals all your diseases, "who redeems your life from destruction. "Hallelujah, God." Jesus and I agreed to see other people. But that don't mean we don't still don't talk from time to time. You've been good to my Tara. I hadn't left a hole in this girl, maybe whatever's in there wouldn't have crawled in. I kicked her out on her birthday. I was feeling all poor, pitiful me because of the shit I had brought on myself. If I wasn't acting like a stupid little bitch, I would have seen trouble coming after her a mile away and I would have handled that shit. He's coming. He's on his way. And he's gonna kill us all. What in God's name...? Whatever the hell it is, it reeks. Lafayette, where is Tara? She with me. I need to know when you gonna be back. I'm here in what used to be my living room. Sook, you gonna have to get up out that house now. Is Tara okay? I ain't half as worried about her as I am about you up in that fucking house. Get out. Run! Be right there. Come on. What are you doing in my house? This is not your house. It is now. I strongly suggest you remove yourself immediately. My, you found yourself quite the specimen. Though I daresay there's nothing stopping him from one day leaving you cold. You don't scare me. Sookie, go now. Ravage me! Ravage me! What did you do to him? What are you? None of your business! Bill, let's get out of here. That was fun! What are you? Aren't you glad I didn't take your advice and quit drinking? This could save our lives. And if I'd left this town when I wanted to, nobody'd be in this situation. Don't beat yourself up, Sam. You've been real good to this town. Even if you are a sometimes-nudist. What if Terry had shot that guy in the head instead of the shoulder? The people are gonna start dying soon. People are already dying. Nancy LeVoir, Daphne... Hell, I never even knew her last name. Landry. If that was even her real name. I heard y'all was close. I'm real sorry. Thanks. When I was growing up I had a nanny. Her name was Annie. Annie the nanny. She used to say to me that... in the country of the blind, the one-eyed man was king. I think she told me that because she thought I was... one of the blind. But you... You got the burden of being the one-eyed man. I envy that. I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't either. Do you know anybody named Peanut Burch? I wish I could remember. I know there's something I was supposed to do. Harder! Harder! Asshole! Oh, mama. That's good. All right! This party's over! Come on! What the hell is wrong with you people? What you gotta go do that for? Piece of shit! Let's go! Hey, asshole! - Come here. - Ambush! Ambush! Okay, stay chill. Nobody needs to get hurt. Yeah! Nail her! Wait, stop! Don't hurt my special lady. Do it! I need a haircut anyway, baby. Yeah, I'm gonna do it! Timeout. Time the fuck out! All right, Stackhouse. Name your demands. Here's how it's gonna be. Y'all go and leave, every last one of you. Leave us alone and then you can have her. All right. The order is to retreat. Immediately. God damn it! When I give an order, you follow it. Now get on out of here. We will unfuck this situation at a later date. Move it! Fall out! Out! Out! Left, right, left! Come on, then! Double-time. Let's go! All right, Stackhouse. You gonna hand her over. Keep moving. Move! The faster you move, the quicker you get her. My hero. I love it when you get all military like that. Where's your guns? I'm all right. No, you are not all right. None of this is all right. I'm calling Eric. I will not turn to Eric. I gotta get you to Dr. Ludwig! Sookie, what happened back there? - What did you do to her? - I don't know. I swear. It was Maryann that attacked me in the woods. Evenwithout a scar I could feel her there on my back when she was touching me. - I will kill her. - Good. How? Tara has been under Maryann's influence. Maybe she can be of some help to us. Give me your wrist so I can heal. Sam, it's Stackhouse. You can come on out. They're gone. Look, I got rid of all them saucer-eyed motherfuckers. Bullshit. I swear on my gran's grave. - Let's see your eyes. - My eyes? Oh. Now get out here. I locked all the doors. Hey, thanks, Jason. But... I don't think they're gonna let up till they get me. How the hell did you get them out? I threatened to shoot a bunch of nails into Arlene's brain. But guys, come here. If we gonna get out of here, we gonna need even a bigger divergence. There's Sam Merlotte! Get him! That ain't exactly what I was talking about, but you work with what you got. Go! There's no escaping, Sam Merlotte. The God Who Comes always gets what he comes for. And as for you, Jason Stackhouse. Not cool. There ain't no normal god gonna come nowhere near you people And God ain't gonna be happy with you, Jason. I bet he'll eat you. I always wanted to know what human flesh tastes like. Guys. You guys, you gotta save yourselves. We'll get you out of here, Sam. Then what? She's not gonna let up. Ever. I'm ending this. No fucking way! Maybe this'll all stop with me. Would you snap the fuck out of it! This has got to be the worst motherfucking intervention in History. Oh, thank God. Sook. - How's it going? - Never been better in my whole  life. Come back later. There's no such thing as later during finals week. Calc so blows. Excuse me. Excuse me. I ain't selling tonight, Cream Cheese. Okay? Come on, I'll pay extra. You ain't hearing me. Well, I ain't leaving till I get the V.</i> You are leaving. Slow your row. It ain't even me. Talk to your boy, Eric. He the one got me pushing the shit. Where is she? You can come on in. What's happened to you? Get me the fuck out, you cunt, or I will kill you. We are losing her, Sook. It's all... dark. Nothing. - You see into her head? - Stop trying to rape my brain. I can't see or hear anything. It's not her. It's... She's gone. Don't say that. She in there. Just... Just keep trying. I know, but what am I supposed to do? You have to go further into her mind than you ever have before. You try and kill yourself? I don't blame you, with your fucked-up life. There's something I can't... I can't cross. An abyss. - I will glamour her. - What? It may help. - I don't want to hurt her. - If we leave her like this, who knows what harm may come to her. Or us. You can feel my influence, can't you, Tara? Don't fight it. Let me in, Tara. Let me in. Thank you, Sam. Thank you for giving us all this gift so that he can come into the world. Silence! It is me, the God Who Comes. I have come, and now I am here. You're the God Who Comes? Horns. Need horns. Well, go get them. Sam Merlotte, you are my offering! People, your work here is done. Go home. - Really? - Oh, yes. He is the best offering ever. You will all have... great weather and... good crops. Now leave. Bullshit. God has horns. Is that really God? Lord. Lord. Smite me. What's he saying? I can't hear. - I don't know! - Smite me, Lord. I don't even know what you saying, man. Smite me, motherfucker. I smite thee, Sam Merlotte! Die! What the fuck just happened? I got no fucking idea. There. Happy? Well? Tell your leader I am very pleased with my offering. Thank you, God. You are welcome. You're all blessed. Now go. Squad. Report to Maryann for debriefing. Anybody who wants to de-brief me can do so right now. What the hell happened to Sam? I don't know, man. I don't know. I'll explain later. Just help me put these fucking flares out before they start a fire. That's the last drink I will ever take. Tara, let Sookie in. It's not working. Tara, you are safe here. You have to do exactly as I say. I am not your fucking slave girl. If ever there was a time to listen to a white man, this would be it. Jesus, please, Jesus. Let Sookie in. Now. Oh, my God. I'm crazy. I'm really crazy. It wasn't you. It's not you. Mama! I'm sorr... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mama. I knew it wasn't you, baby girl. I knew it wasn't you. Thank you. I need some air. I gotta go get Eggs. I've known Tara my whole life, and every trace of her was gone. Replaced. I thought vampires were the only ones who could hypnotize people. No offense, Sookie, but humans are shockingly susceptible to about every form of thought manipulation. It's all coming from Maryann. All of it. They eat people's hearts. But she wants more. She wants their souls. - And that chant. - Chant? Bacchus. I've seen that look on your face before and I don't like it. I read about some ancient creatures many years ago. But I always assumed it was just a myth. But I believe Maryann might be one. What is she, and more importantly, how do we kill her? I do not know how to defeat her, but I know one vampire who might. Might. But if I'm gonna make it by daylight, I must leave now. Let's go. I must do this alone. But I'll be back by morning. And Jason and Sam, Tara and Lafayette... you can do more good for them here. You're right. I left everybody before and look what happened. Can you do... whatever it was that you did to Maryann...? You do it again? I don't know. I don't even know what it was that I did. All right. Keep your friends safe, and by all means, you stay away from your home. Promise me. Promise. But I never get to go to the party! You know how many invitations I've passed up to stay home with my crybaby son? You always go, and you always drag me along with you. Oh, you selfish little shit. You can spew as much venom as you want. - You won't go to the Merlotte's. - You could come with me, maybe meet a nice girl instead of that devil slut. I'm tired of this shit. Treat Jess with respect, or I'm gonna lock your ass up in that cubbyhole - until Vampire Bill gets home. - Oh, you're Dirty Harry now, huh? Because you're dipping your penguin dick in that vamper tramp? You are cut from the same cloth as your daddy. You are both half-men. - Miss Fortenberry... - Just calm down. A half-man and a dead whore. Who else would have either of you? Jess, don't. Look, lady. You have no idea how little control I have over my actions. You also don't know that I haven't eaten in days. Seriously? Wait. You give me one good reason why I shouldn't drain you dry. I don't gotta give you nothing. Fuck, no!
