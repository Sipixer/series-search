What did you get yourself into? My God, Jason. Oh, my God. It's okay. Like hell it is! Look at her. She is definitely not. Bangin' on me ain't gonna change anything none. Darling, I heard yelling. Sweet Lord in heaven. What did you do? - Me? - I found her, Miss Lefebvre. He... - He just got here. - I saw you last night. I heard you all fighting, then she took a shot at you, and you ran off. And now she's dead. We had a fight. But I came here to apologize. She fired a gun at you, and you come back to apologize? I didn't do this. - You gotta believe me. - Well, I'm calling the police. Then call 'em! I had nothing to do with this. Synchro: mpm, Arrow Episode 4 Season 1 I don't get it. She was so pretty. Well, maybe... it was just her time. She was only 23 years old. Ain't no 23-year-old in the world whose time has come. Hey, y'all. What'd I miss? Dawn's dead, Mama. I know. What a shame. Who they got in there? Jason and Sookie Stackhouse. She found the body, but it sounds like they think he might have done it. He didn't. - Then who did? - I don't know. Probably the same person that killed Maudette. I tell you one thing, man. We're too small a town to be losing girls one after the other like this. Whoever it is, I hope they fry the fuck. - Pardon my language, Miss Maxine. - No need to apologize. We're all excited. To be a fly on the wall in that apartment right now. Now, I realize you've been through a lot. And you're scared. But I need you to try and remember when you got here. Was the door open or just unlocked? Open, I think. It pisses me off the way she calls me "Andy,"</i> everyone calls Bud "sheriff. " Why can't they call me</i> "detective," goddamn it? When am I gonna get some respect around here?</i> Would you look at that? A fine pair of perfect, natural breasts.</i> I'd have laid down money that they were fake.</i> Well done, God. Now and then, not so well done, letting her die like you did.</i> Fuck. Fuck. Fuck am I gonna do? I already got out of this once.</i> No way they gonna let me walk again. And I'm too damned pretty to go to prison.</i> Sorry... What was the question? Is that the exact position you found her in? I covered her up with a sheet, but - but I don't think I touched her. - I wish you hadn't have done that. Next time I find a friend dead, I'll try to remember that. I keep waiting for this heat to break, but it won't. It's the stubbornest summer we're having. Oh, I know. I feel like a cat on a hot tin roof. That's from a play. I sure could use a beer right now, me. Y'all want some? - If you're getting one. - Bring me one. While you're in there, would you rustle up a bucket of ice? And some of those nice plastic cups we got at the Super Save a Bunch last weekend. And maybe some paper doilies. Lord, woman, what's with you and them doilies? Doilies are to protect the table. We outside. They might wanna put 'em down on the car or something. Just bring the doilies, please. Fine. If all our conversations end with them saying "fine," why do they bother putting up a fight? So this fight you heard Dawn and Jason having, - were you able to make any of it out? - Just the tail end, right before the gunshot. He called her... a very bad word. And what was that word? It starts with a "B". I see. That'll be all. Thank you, Miss Lefebvre. You're welcome, Andy, dear. You gonna make me wait in the car, can you at least turn on the A.C.? I know you can hear me. Fuck. Fuck. Couldn't hear me yelling? Car's hotter than hell. Shut up. Thank you, Sookie. - We'll be in touch. - Let's roll before I melt in here. Stop. Mama, I don't need any sunblock. Please, Hoyt, if anyone needs sunblock, it's you. Your skin's whiter than Desitin. Mama, I'm gonna move out. I swear it, I will. You won't. Now get down so I can get your neck. Came as soon as I heard. I'm sorry you had to be the one to find her. He was gonna be somebody. Right? I guess. I tell you, Sook, sometimes I don't even recognize this world we're living in. - I mean, goddamn it. - Be careful, now. God didn't do this. You think maybe I should shut down the bar for the day? All that'd do is deny people a good, stiff drink - on the day they could use it the most. - Yeah, but... I know it's supposed to be my day off and all, but the last thing I need right now is time alone with my thoughts. All right, then. We'll open. I may be late, though. I gotta swing by home and tell Gran what's going on. That was le Bon Temps, she already knows Still... - with Jason and everything- - Excuse me, are you Mr. Merlotte? Detective in charge tells me you're the landlord. - That's right. - We need to get in the victim's storage unit, but we don't have a key. If you could find one, it'd be a big help right about now. Miss? Could you please let us by? Neil Jones, my new apprentice. He's from Kentucky. Lift, kid. Come on, lift. You don't have to be too careful. Ain't gonna hurt her. So you had a fight, she took a shot at you with a gun, and you just left? Didn't see her again till you showed up with booze and flowers - and found her dead this morning? - That's my story, it ain't gonna change. Except it just did change. You just admitted you're the one who found her, not Sookie. I didn't. You're trying to trick me. It don't count if I get tricked. Does it? Make you hot? Killing girls and sticking it to 'em? See, I think it does. I think it turns you on. Sounds to me like it turns you on. Tell me, is that how you do it? Kill 'em then fuck 'em? Or do you fuck 'em and then kill 'em? Or I know. You strangle 'em as you're fucking 'em, don't you, you sick fuck? How many other women you done this to besides Dawn and Maudette? I didn't... Gotta use the bathroom. Man's gotta pee, Andy. - Bathroom? Bathroom? - It's over there. Son of a bitch. You shouldn't have laughed. What are you talking about? When he came back at me with that crack about me being the one getting turned on, you shouldn't have laughed. I guess it just struck me as funny, 'cause you were working so hard on him, and I don't think he did it. What the fuck? Bud, we got two dead girls, and this dumbfuck admits to sleeping with both of 'em - within hours before they were killed. - Yeah, and both our dead girls got bit by vampires too. Far as I can tell, Stackhouse don't have fangs. What the hell you doing in there? I'll be out in a minute. What the fuck was that? Fuck, you gotta be shitting me. I said, hold on. I'll be there. - I hear you guys brought Jason in. - So? - You charging him with anything? - Not yet. Asking him some questions. I assume he's been properly Mirandized, then. Tell me you informed him he has a right to have an attorney present. Maybe. Doesn't matter though, 'cause he's got you here now. Is that funny 'cause I'm a woman or 'cause I'm a black woman? I thought it was funny, you know, just 'cause you talk like a lawyer but you ain't one. How do you know all this anyway? You been taking night classes? School is just for white people looking for other white people to read to 'em. I figure I save my money and read to myself. I'm gettin' you out of here. - Like hell you are. - You charging him with anything? She's right. We can't hold him. He can't say where he was last night. At least could done make some shit up. Listen, I told you where I was. I was... home alone. Sleeping. You never sleep alone, Stackhouse, and you know it... Guys, he was with me. What's this, now? If y'all were together last night, how come he don't seem to know it? Because I asked him not to tell anybody about us. And he's just surprised to hear me being the one blabbin' about it. Aren't you, baby? Wha... You buying this? People think just because we got vampires out in the open now race isn't the issue no more. But you ever see the way folks look at mixed couples in this town? Race may not be the hot-button issue it once was, but it's still a button you can push on people. Would you be willing to go on record with this? - You're lying, you'd be guilty... - Perjury. I know. You got a Bible, I'll swear on it right here. Jason and I were together last night and it was a beautiful thing. You're free to go. Jesus. - Come on, baby. Let's take you home. - Okay, baby. Hey, Gran. - I heard. - About Jason too? He didn't do it, you know. - I know. - Jason may be many things, but he's not a murderer. I know... The thing is though, in all the years that I've lived in Bon Temps, I can't recall but... two, maybe three murders. And now there are two in one week. People are not gonna stand for it. If the police can't find the person who did it, they're gonna find Jason. - He needs your help. - Gran, how am I supposed to... You use the gift God gave you. Listen in on people, keep your ears open. You're bound to hear something. - It's got nothing to do with my ears. - Whatever it is you use to listen, use it. He is your brother, Sookie. Good girl. Come and pick up your fucking orders...</i> Who killed Dawn? I wonder if he had sex with her or not.</i> Seems like a waste if he didn't. She sure was pretty. Never even looked at me.</i> Can't get that letter in Cosmo out of my head.</i> How much better could an orgasm with a vampire be?</i> I wonder, is it that much better?</i> What the hell is this world coming to? Dead fucks, niggers </i> and regular folk all livin' together. If God wanted it like this,</i> he'd have made us look the same. It ain't good. Maybe these really </i> - are the end times. - What everybody's upset about? These whores had it coming, hanging out in vampire bars.</i> That ain't natural, and it ain't safe.</i> You seem sad that girl is dead. I wonder if y'all were friends.</i> And if you were, that means you're probably next.</i> Fucking fang-bangers, crazy, every last one of you. Just like those women who write love letters to serial killers...</i> I asked for ranch dressing with these fries. Two margaritas. That Dawn sure left us high and dry, didn't she? It's not like she meant not to be here. I know, but if she didn't spend her nights off at that vamp bar in Shreveport, she still would be. Did I just hear you right? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Please. Ain't there even a part of you think she had it coming? No, not a single part. And I'm taking your ranch. - You're late. - Sorry, boss. Listen, we should probably talk. About last night? What about last night? You're gonna make this hard on me, aren't you? Actually, no, I'm gonna make it very, very easy. Nothing happened between us last night. And if anybody asks, you didn't see me at all, okay? I'm telling people I spent the night with Jason. - Jason Stackhouse? - Yes. I was with Jason last night. And if you say different, they're gonna haul both our asses into jail. You lied to the police for him? Shit, Tara. I know you carry a torch for the guy, but... I don't get it, I really don't. There's more to Jason than meets than eye. Deep down he is a very good person. Fuck! Go fucking down. Come on. In Iraq today, 10 U.S. Marines were killed...</i> Motherfucker. Oh, baby. My sweet, sweet baby. Sure is too bad about Dawn. I already miss the way her butt used to hang out of the bottom of her shorts.</i> Sookie Stackhouse. I hope that brother of yours gets</i> what he deserves and he fries for what he's done.</i> - They were trash. - Crying shame is what it is.</i> This place ain't gonna be the same without Dawn.</i> She had the prettiest, nicest smile. Why was I so scared to talk to her? I'll neve know what her voice sounded like.</i> I bet it sounded like angels and parakeets mixed together.</i> Quit flirting, Barry. I just wanted to say thank you. For... For what? All right then. Jason, you look me in the eye and you tell me the truth. Did you kill Dawn? What? No. Jesus, Sook. Look, when Maudette died, I thought I might've done it. And it turned out I didn't. With Dawn, I don't even think I might've done it, so I know I didn't. You swear? But the way you're acting, seems like you want it to be me. Sorry. Gran asked me to listen in on folks, see if I can't clear your name. And sometimes it's hard... I gotta stop you, because it sounds like you're reving up for a long one. And I really need to see LaFayette. Talk to you later. - What the fuck, LaFayette? - I'm busy. What's your problem? My problem is my dick. It's been hard since 3:00. - Something went wrong with that vamp... - Will you shut the fuck up? - Sorry. - It's your loud ass. And ain't nothing wrong with the shit I sold you. What the hell is it? How much you take? The whole thing. You took the whole thing? You a dizzy motherfucker. I said one drop, two max, and you took the whole thing? I was in the backseat of a cop car, I had it on me, and I panicked, okay? Now, just give me something to make it go away, I don't care what it costs. Ain't no antidote to V, boyfriend. When my grandpa was alive, he had gout. And he said just the weight of a sheet on his big toe was too much to bear. So help me God, that's exactly what this feels like. Maybe you should try rubbing one out. Were you listening to me? I got gout of the dick! Vampires. Any fries for you? What you want? May I have a bottle of O negative, please? A negative's all we got. A negative then. Pretty crowded in here tonight. Something going on? Sam just bought a case. We got O neg and A neg. Plenty of each. Fuck him. I'm giving him A. And don't microwave it neither. He can have it cold. You are so bad. Are we out of O? Blood is blood. What difference does it make? He prefers O. - I'll take it to him if you like. - Good. He gives me the creeps. Come on. Where are we going? You know my friend who works here? Someone killed her last night. How? - Say you're sorry. - Excuse me? You wanna learn to fit in with people? You gotta say you're sorry. You don't even have to mean it. Lord knows they don't most of the time. I am sorry. Thank you. Anyway, I'm the one who found her. Strangled. - Cops think it was my brother. - Was it? No, he's not capable of it. I've been around long enough to know just about anyone is capable - of just about anything. - He didn't do it. So I listened in on people's thoughts, hoping I might hear something to clear him. And apparently there's this vampire bar where Maudette and Dawn used to hang out at in Shreveport. You know it? Fangtasia. Fangtasia? You have to remember that most vampires are very old. Puns used to be the highest form of humor. Well, I was thinking if I went there I could do some sniffing around. You think maybe you could take me? How about tonight? The sooner the better. I just gotta tell Sam I'm leaving, - then run home and change. - Meet you there. Thank you. I'm asking you this as a friend, okay? This is not a date. Fine. - It's not a date. I'm serious. - As am I. Is it all right if I take the rest of the night off? Why? I need to go to that vampire bar in Shreveport so I can snoop around and see if I can clear my brother's name, and Mr. Compton was kind enough to agree to take me. Oh, Jesus. Sookie, you gonna get yourself killed, - you know that? - I'll be fine. Baby, the fact that you think you'll be fine, only proves just how not fine you're gonna be. Vampires think about one thing, and one thing only: drinking your blood. Like humans aren't bloodthirsty? People want to see my brother hang for a crime he didn't commit. Is that what you want? - I'm not saying don't help him. - Frankly, I'm surprised at you. I thought you were for the VRA. I think they should have their own bars. I just don't think people - ought to go there. - Separate but equal? I don't give a shit about equal. We can give them more than we got. - Just so long as everything's separate. - Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. But But I'm going. I can't stop you. You can't. Penny for your thoughts. I thought you liked not knowing my thoughts. Most of the time I do. You won't care for it. That doesn't mean I don't wanna know. You look like vampire bait. What's that supposed to mean? I promised your grandmother no harm would come to you at Fangtasia tonight. I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to keep that promise with you dressed like this. So are you saying you think I look nice? Doesn't matter what I think. This isn't a date, remember? This ain't a part of my job description, goddamn it. Don't turn around! What? - I said don't look at me. - What the hell are you doing? I think I might've OD'd. Oh, my God. On what? V. You're doing V now? It was my first time. Where on earth did you come across V in this town? My cousin is dealing vampire blood now? Goddamn idiot. Least that explains why I walked in on you dancing around in that Laura Bush mask yesterday. Because I gotta tell you, without a reason, that was some fucked up shit. All right, let me see it. How long have you had the erection? - Well, how do you know? - I read. You're not the first vain-ass, body-conscious ex-jock to overdo the V and wind up with an acute case of priapism. - Pa what? - Priapism. Now lift the ribeye and let me see what we're dealing with. Oh, Jason, that's... Yeah, it's bad, ain't it? Sweetie, we gotta get you to a hospital now. - No hospitals. No way. - Do you want to keep your dick or not? I haven't seen you in a while. I'm mainstreaming. Good for you. Who's the doll? Pam, this is Sookie. Sookie, this is Pam. Pleased to meet you. Can I see your ID? Sure. How funny. Who'd have thought? Getting carded at a vampire bar. I can no longer tell human ages. We must be careful we serve no minors in any capacity. Twenty-five, huh? How sweet it is. This feels a little bit like what a vampire bar would look like if it were a... A ride at Disneyworld. Don't get too comfortable. It tends to get more authentic as the night wears on. Can I get you something to drink? Please. How's it going, Bill? Very well. I'll say it is. This your meal for tonight? This is my friend Sookie. Sookie, Longshadow. Nice to meet you. I'll have a gin and tonic, please. And I'll have a bottle of O Negative. Sookie here would like to know if she could ask you a few questions. Would this be acceptable? I just have a couple of pictures I'd love you to take a look at. You recognize either of these women? Yeah, I've seen them both here before. Great, thank you. And do you also happen to remember who they hung around with? That's something we don't notice here. You won't either. Okay, then. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time. This one. She wanted to die. - How do you know? - Everyone who comes here does in their own way. That's who we are: Death. Oh, my God. He's so powerful. So beautiful. The closer I step, the more beautiful he gets. You can do this. Just walk up there and offer yourself to him... How's your drink? A gin and tonic's pretty much a gin and tonic no matter where you drink it. I know exactly what you mean. Who's that? Oh, you noticed him, did you? - No, it's not like that. I just... - Everyone does. That's Eric. He's the oldest thing in this bar. I'm Taryn. Still think you're in Disneyworld? You say that this has never happened to you before? No, sir. Well, no sign of hypertension. I'm gonna ask a question and I'm gonna need you to be honest with me. Have you taken any drugs today? - No, that's a negative. - So no marijuana, then? How about cocaine? - Meth? - No. Vampire blood? What? Hell, that's sick. I mean, to even suggest that is... Yeah, yeah, you'd never do anything like that. All right. Let's have a look. Oh, boy. Sure glad I'm not you. That looks kind of like an eggplant, what with that color and the way it's all swell up at the end. Can you fix it? Ordinarily we like to treat this in stages. First and least radical being an injection of anti-inflammatory drugs into the penis. A needle in my dick? That's the least radical thing you can do? It is, yes. But you've progressed to the point you wouldn't benefit from that at all. In my opinion, we need to aspirate. I need to drain the blood out of your penis. Okay, I'll leave you to it. Where are you going? Look, I will admit to sometimes having a sick curiosity about medical shit, but I ain't that fucking curious. Tara, stay with me? I ain't never gonna be the same after this. You're not? Are you ready, son? Ain't you gonna put me out or something? I don't think we can afford the time it would take to sedate you. Besides, without knowing what other substances you've taken, I don't want to risk a drug interaction. Now, just lean on back there for me. There you go. It's... It's gonna be okay. You gotta breathe, though. All right, then. You're gonna feel a stick in three, two... I hate to ask but would you mind walking me to my car tonight? No problem. Don't hate to ask. Not with what's been going on. Well, I ain't never been with no vampire. But still, you know, you can't be too safe, you know? Get the lights for me, would you? I'm used to living in a small town and knowing everybody in it. You knew you were safe.</i> It's a new day now. Don't I know it. How come no one fucked me? I got a dog collar too. How'd you like me to rip that tape off your tits?</i> It ain't gay if a guy's a vampire, is he?</i> I'm gonna get in a fight if I don't fuck a vampire tonight.</i> You able to pick up anything? All anyone's thinking about here is sex, sex, sex. One needn't be telepathic to pick up on that. Don't say "uh-oh." Vampire are not supposed to say "uh-oh." It's Eric. He's scanned you twice. He's going to summon us. He can do that? - It has been a while. - Yes, well, - I've been... - Mainstreaming. I heard. I see that is going well for you. Yes, of course. Uh, sorry. Eric, this is my friend... - Sookie Stackhouse. - How do you know my name? I never forget a pretty face. You're in my vault. Great. That's just great. It's nice to meet you. - Well, aren't you sweet. - Not really. I understand you've been asking questions about some of my customers. - I have. - If you have anything to ask, you should ask it of me. All right. I... You recognize either one of these girls? Well, this one offered herself to me. But I found her too pathetic for my attentions. Now, this one, however... I have tasted. - I remember them both. - On account of the vault? Never had either of them, though. They weren't really my type. Well, thanks a lot. - That is all your time I need to take. - I'm not finished with you yet. Please. Sit. Are you quite attached to your friend? She is mine. I am his. What a pity. For me. Sit with us. We have catching up to do, you and I. It has been too long. My backup was supposed to be here 15 minutes ago.</i> I can't handle a raid on my own. These fucking vampires... We have to get out of here. Cops are coming. There's gonna be a riot. - You are an undercover cop? - I'm not but that man in the hat is. We do nothing illegal. Go ahead and do it. Open me up. I don't care. Make me feel something.</i> There's a vampire named Taryn in the toilet with that man you kicked. - She's feeding on him. - How do you know this? Freeze! Police! Don't move! Follow me. Let's get out! I enjoyed meeting you. You will come again. Get your ugly self down here. Hey, Tara. Sookie ain't home. No, just please let me in, okay? I'm gonna crack you in a way you'll... - Don't let her in. - Is there a problem here? You bet your tiny white ass there's a problem. Little bitch hid my Captain Morgan. I didn't hide it, Mom. I threw it out. Look, my Gran's at the market and I ain't supposed to let anyone in while she's gone. - You let her in. - Well, I know her. - Mama, let him go. - Maybe I should call Sheriff Dearborne, so he can come out here and throw you in jail where I guarantee ain't no Captain Morgan gonna be waiting for you. This ain't over. Can we turn this down? What language are they speaking, anyhow? Cambodian. You don't like it? You think we can pull over for a minute? I need things to stop. Sure. I just need a couple minutes of quiet and then we can go. Well, I'm in no hurry. You take your time. I'm sorry I've got you into any trouble. Don't apologize. We vampires are always in some kind of trouble. I prefer to be in it with you. Open up. Open the window and let me do the talking, okay? - Hello, officer. - Evening, miss. - What are you two doing out this late? - Driving home from a date. We were raiding a bar not too far from here. Y'all coming from there by any chance? Not us. It's called Fantasia. That ring any bells? How about you, son? You seem awful quiet. Don't you talk? I'm a man of few words. A man of few words. I like that. Let me just shine this light here on your neck, miss, if you don't mind. Not at all. Why don't you ask her if you can shine it between her legs? Excuse me. Vampires sometimes like to feed from the femoral artery. The blood flows more freely down there so one doesn't have to suck as hard. Or so I've been told. I like your gun. It's a beautiful weapon. Thank you. May I have it? I want you to stop this right now. Sure. I guess. Nice. It's heavier than I imagined it. Is it loaded? Well, yes. Yes, it is. Bill, you are freaking me out. Now, you listen to me, officer. I do not take kindly to you shining your light in the eyes of my female companion. And as I have more than 100 years on you, I do not take kindly you to calling me "son." So the next time you pull somebody over on suspicion of being a vampire, you better pray to God that you're wrong. Because that vampire may not be as kind to you as I'm about to be. I'm not gonna kill you. But I am gonna keep your gun. - Does that sound fair? - Yes. - Yes, what?
