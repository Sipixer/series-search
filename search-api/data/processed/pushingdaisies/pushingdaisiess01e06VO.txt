unique than others.</i> You're the only one for me. I know you feel that now, but... There are things you want. There are things we both want. So? Everyone wants stuff. We wake up every day with a list of wishes a mile long, and maybe we spend our lives trying to make those wishes come true. But... just because we want them doesn't mean we need them to be happy. What do you need to be happy? You. Thanks to Raceman
