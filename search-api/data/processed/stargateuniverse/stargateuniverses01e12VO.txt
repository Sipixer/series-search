We are going to make it home. This ship came here for a reason! Destiny is powered by the stars themselves. He and Young are bumping heads. Not sure which camp is the better choice. Let's pretend nothing happened. We need to be ready for the next encounter. For the sake of the crew. For the sake of the crew. I'm curious about the incident with Dr. Rush. I managed to activate the systems on the crashed ship. Aliens showed up. Do not engage. Chloe is on those ships. They didn't want to destroy us. What they really want is Destiny. Another nightmare? Every time I close my eyes. Maybe you should talk to T.J. It's not the dream, it's... What? Look, you're... They're gone, okay? We got you back, you're safe now. So, move on? Get over it, right? That's not what I'm saying. Forget it. I want to help you. It's fine. I just need to clear my head. Same dream? Me too. What did they do to us? I don't remember everything. Yeah, me neither. Maybe that's a good thing. Everyone thinks we're safe. They think that they'll never find us again. We're not safe, are we? Projet-SG (1.00) We need to talk. I was thinking the same thing. Were you, now? The communication stones. - What about them? - You took one. It's the only explanation. You were the first to open the box. You kept one for yourself. And why would I do that? Maybe you thought it was some kind of insurance policy. You thought it wasn't safe to keep in your room, especially after that whole incident with Spencer's gun. So you kept one with you. That's how the aliens got hold of one, and that's how I wound up on that ship. Doesn't sound like a denial, Rush. We should really be worried about how they found us. They tracked the stone... - We don't even know how that works. - Maybe they're smarter than us? They're advanced, sure, but not as advanced as the Ancients. I suspect it's something much simpler. - Like what? - Subspace tracking device. We took care of the ship you brought over. But there may be another one... Attached to the outside of the hull. Where is this coming from? I was in direct neural contact with one of the aliens for quite some time. Ever since, I've been having... Flashes. Images. Of what? You don't know? I don't know, but what I do know is, they've been tracking this ship for some time before we got here. For them, Destiny's something like an obsession. Look, we're out of FTL, will be for several hours. Now's the perfect time to take a look. Kino's through. Mr. Brody, please dial back the tensile strength of the shield. Roger that. You know, it's a big ship. - This could take a while. - You have something better to do? Keep me posted. Can I have a word with you, Colonel? All right. Not here. I don't know what happened on the planet between you and Rush, maybe I don't want to know. Spit it out. We never did find out who put that weapon in your quarters. - There has been some speculation. - I'll bet. As far as I'm concerned, we were better off without him. I just want you to know that whatever happens... Colonel Young, come in. Go ahead. We've found it. It's on the underside of the ship. I fed the kino track into the shuttle controls, so it should lead you right there. Any time now, Lieutenant. All right, guys, ship's jumping to FTL in a little over one hour. That's plenty of time. What is this place? As far as I can tell, it's some kind... of Ancient research lab. Not exactly ideal for our purposes, but the level of connectivity with the ship's main systems should be adequate. Do we have to do it now? We'll never get a better opportunity. You should get your people in position. What are you doing here? I want to see the alien ship. You know it's just parked there to track us. I know, but I want to see it. Come in. There it is. How long has it been on the ship? Rush says since before we got here, although it's not entirely clear how he knows. He knows. Weapons hot... Target locked. Weapons firing. That's it. They can't get to us anymore. Brody... Brody, where are you? Hydroponics. All right, stay there. It's on. What, now? You signed off on this. Yeah, I know. I just... Stand by. Didn't expect to see you here. I just wanted to check on some of the medicinals here. Right, sure. Meet up with you in about a half an hour. That was just... Volker and his... bridge club. Docking procedure. Sir, I'm reading a negative on the docking clamps. Let's reset. Still negative. Eli, we've got a problem. The docking clamps will not engage. What? That's impossible. Hang on. What the hell? I'm locked out. What do you mean you're locked out? Someone's transferring controls to another station.</i> I've got nothing. The door won't open either. We're jumping to FTL in 8 minutes. What happens if the ship's not locked down?</i> The shield won't envelop the shuttle. - And what? - <i>I don't know for sure.</i> Nothing good, I know that. The shuttle wouldn't go into FTL with the rest of the ship. - Which means what? - <i>I'm not sure,</i> but I think the shuttle would be vaporized. Seven minutes. All right... Eli, let's... Let's think this through. You said somebody was transferring controls? - That's what it looks like from here. - <i>Well, can you do something about it?</i> - If I... - <i>Stay calm.</i> Take your time. Five minutes, sir. I'll bet you a buck. Rush, this is Young. Over. Greer, this is Colonel Young. Go ahead, sir. Take a detail. Find Rush now. Four minutes. - Stop it. Stop it now. - Chloe, we've talked about this... The shuttle docking clamps won't engage. - What? - You have to stop. - But I can't. - They're going to die. I can't stop in the middle of this. - They are going to die! - Dammit! Eli, this is Dr. Rush, come in. - Go ahead. - <i>Now, listen carefully.</i> I'm in the process of transferring access to the computer away from the control interface room. Now, there's nothing you can do to stop that.</i> All you're doing is slowing it down. Let me complete the transfer, then I'll lock down the clamps manually.</i> Don't listen to him. Keep doing what you're doing. We're in no man's land here. Neither of us have control. Now, let me finish before we jump to FTL.</i> Don't do it, Eli. That is an order. Two minutes, sir. - What's going on? - It can't dock and we're about to jump. I didn't know the transfer would cause this to happen. - Shut it down. - I don't have everything yet. If I stop now, Eli's going to shut me out, and our position will be compromised. - Colonel? - <i>Negative.</i> Eli, do not let that man take over a single system. He's doing it anyway. The transfer's almost complete. I know why you're doing this. I also know you agreed that nobody should get hurt. We could lose everyone on our side. Shut it down! I got it! I got it! Let's go. Good work, Eli. So, where do we stand? How much control do we have? We're about to find out. What the hell? Come on. It's Rush. He's sealing off corridors all over the ship. Brody, why's your radio turned off? Is there a problem? Sorry. You weren't supposed to be down here. Guys, what is it? What's happening? - Get out of my way. - Put the gun down. - I'm not going to ask you again. - Just take it easy. Airman, what are you doing? Something's going on, Lieutenant. We're cut off from the rest of the ship. I'm trying to report to the Colonel, but these people won't let me through. I'm sorry. It was inevitable a few people would be stuck on the wrong side of the line. What line? We've sealed off Colonel Young and most of the military personnel. To put it bluntly, we've taken the ship. Put the gun down. Not a chance. Why you doing this? Colonel Young's actions left me no choice. I'm doing this on behalf of all the civilians onboard this ship. What do I do? We're not going to go shoot anybody. Put the gun down. Now, everyone just needs to remain calm. This will be over soon enough. Rush, this is Young. I know exactly what you're trying to do, and there is no way in hell</i> that I am going to let you get away with it.</i> I'm not acting alone, Colonel. Besides, what's done is done. I already have the food and water supplies, plus control of all accessible systems has been transferred over to the consoles on my side of the line. What is it? That's not entirely true. He stopped the transfer prematurely so I could lock down the shuttle, which saved your lives, by the way... Moving on... That left us control with one key system... Life support. So you mean that we can shut down their heat and air on the other side whenever we want? We wouldn't do that. Do you have any idea what's going on here? As a matter of fact, I don't. Am I the only one? You've got our attention. What do you want? All military personnel to hand over their weapons immediately and submit to civilian authority. Is that it? It does tend to be how civilized people structure their societies, Colonel, be that as in nations or in microcosm. - As opposed to what? - <i>Military dictatorship.</i> That's got to stop. Well, Eli tells me there might be a problem with your plan. Something to do with life support. I was hoping that he wouldn't notice that. Anyway, I've done the calculations. We're occupying a much larger area, therefore we have a greater volume of air. Plus we have the hydroponics lab producing some oxygen.</i> Not enough to make a difference. If you cut us off right now, we'd have at least three days, which is around about the same amount of time you would have to go without water.</i> If it comes down to a contest... I'm not sure what the final outcome would be, but it wouldn't be pretty. It's not pretty now. Sergeant... What did he say? Nothing, but they're still pumping air in here. He'll give in. He's got no choice. We have the Gate room and the communication room. He's completely cut off. Yeah, but he still has one thing that might make a difference. Come on, buddy, you got this. It's a very complicated lock-out program, okay? I'm going to need some time. So, I got a head count. Lieutenant Johansen and Airman Dunning are unaccounted for, so I think we can assume that they are on the other side. Of course, because someone's on the other side, doesn't mean they're... - On the other side. - Obviously not. We've got half a dozen civilians, all of which claim to know nothing. - What about Chloe? - She's with them. - Like I said... - How's it coming? Slowly, and it doesn't help that I'm starting to get hungry. Low blood sugar is not my friend. It's not the food that I'm worried about. It's the water. If dehydration sets in, we'll be in trouble. - Is there anything we can do about it? - They've offered a trade. A limited amount of food and water in exchange for Eli. - Me? - I've already agreed to it. He's the only one who can get us around whatever Rush did to those computers. I know that, and they know that, and that's why they want Eli, but there is another way in. All right, guys, I'm here, and as you can see... I am alone. Open the door. Irony. Put it down. Come on. So... Here we are. I can't help but notice that you seem to be, well, working with these people. What did you think, I was a prisoner? I was hoping they... Wait a minute. In the control room, when you came by, were you just trying to distract me? So that I wouldn't notice what Rush was doing? What? Don't "what" me... Of course not. Look, I knew it was coming, but I didn't know when. Believe me or don't believe me. It doesn't matter. I guess... I'm just a little surprised you're taking Rush's side against Young. Rush was an inconvenience, so Colonel Young left him on that planet to die. Deliberately. The hole the aliens cut in the hull is on the other side of the line, on their six. Suit up. Lieutenant, I already told you, I want you here in case it doesn't work. We shouldn't have given food and water. It's just going to give them more time. That doesn't matter. They know they've got no choice. Why don't they just give it up, then? He's a full bird Colonel in the United States Air Force. He's used to getting his way, but he also knows that every military in the free world takes orders from a civilian government. We just need to stick together until he remembers that. I'll leave you to it. To what? Once again, I find myself in need of your assistance. What exactly are you doing? We are going to squeeze every last ounce of power out of the ship's systems, and then when we're done, we're gonna find some more. What for? The shields. We're going to need them. The tracking device was on that ship that we blew up. One tracking device was on that ship? There's another one? Surgically implanted in my chest, next to my heart. Colonel... we gotta go. This is insane! Does anyone else know about this? I had to be sure she wasn't implanted too. And? There's no surgical scar. They're almost within weapons range. I'm dialing up the shield. Wait! Maybe... Maybe that's the wrong plan. Maybe we should throw everything we have into weapons. We can't take on three ships at once. We can't run away either. That's exactly why I have to do this. If we can survive until the next jump, they're going to realize they can't get past the shields, - and they're gonna give up. - Don't know that. That's the way it's been for a long time. They attack, they try and get onboard, the ship's automated defenses. Stop them. They're attacking us now because they're hoping we're going to make a mistake. Don't! Eli, do you want to die? That's what's going to happen. If you don't let me do this. What's the matter with you? - Right. - What? Sure. You'll open the door for Scott and his team, and I'll go find Rush. I just wanted to see if there's anything you need. You can let us out of here. Don't worry, you won't stay in here for much longer. Because the Colonel's going to take back the ship. You don't have any idea what you're up against. I think we do. Not a clue. Sorry, but a bunch of civilians up against the Colonel's training and experience? It's about listening to reason. Not once you took the ship. That made it war, and that's what we do. It's not going to make life on this ship any easier, it's not going to make what those aliens did to you. Neither will anything you could possibly say to me. - What was that? - They're back. What's happening? Stay here. This is Wray. Report. We've got company. So I figured. Let's go. Sergeant? They're fine. I went easy on them. That's it. That's all the power we're going to get. The shields are holding. Listen up. If you have to use force, so be it, but we still have to live with these people tomorrow. Remember that. - Go. - Yes, sir. What is going on? They found us. How? We knew this was coming. We're prepared. Who's we? I know Rush is the only person on this ship who has any idea what you've been through, but it doesn't mean that you can trust him. He saved my life when Colonel Young was ready to sacrifice us both. We can't afford to have a majority vote every time a decision needs to be made. We need a leader. All right, put the gun down. You guys okay? Yeah, we're fine. Come on, let's go. You were surgically implanted with a tracking device. Is that what this was all about? You thought if Young was in command he'd what? Throw you out of an airlock? Given my previous experience, it's hardly an unreasonable assumption, and remember, this was your idea. Doesn't matter whose idea it was. It's over. Everybody down, now! On the floor! Get down! I said get down! Wait, wait, wait! Wait. Get the weapons online. He can't. Why? I created a separate lockout code. Give him the code. - We're under attack. - I know. The best form of defense is to devote all of our power to the shields. - Not your decision. - It's already been done. Really? Maybe I should just shoot you right now. Get 'em out of here. Wait. He has a transmitter in his chest. That's how they've been following us. Even if we survive to the next jump, they'll just track us again. T.J., take care of it. What? Cut it out. I can't just go digging around in his chest. - She's not qualified. - We'll use the stones. - We'll get someone... - We're not equipped. Are you crazy? That we've got to get that transmitter out. Sir, I don't recommend giving up any military personnel at this particular moment. I'll do it. I don't need to know what I'm doing. It won't be me, right? This is Dr. Brightman. Thank you. What did you give him? An anesthetic I made from the venom of a creature we ran into a while back. In low doses, it'll knock you out pretty good. You gave him alien venom? Is that safe? Without it, we'd all be dead right now. I thought at first we were gonna have to go in blind, but then Eli, he's one of our people, came up with this. It's a camera. He took it out of a kino. - What's a...? - It's like a video transmitter. Anyway, we took it apart and mounted it on that, and that way, we can go in arthroscopically. What is that? - We're under attack. - What? Shields are holding. We're good. Welcome on board. - All right, that's it. - That's it? We got weapons? I found a way around the lock-out, but I think... What? I think Rush might be right about this one. If I'm reading this correctly, the shields can't take more. - All the more reason to shoot back. - We can't spare the power. Weaken the shields even a little, and they might collapse completely. That's what's going to happen anyway, isn't it? But maybe, not before we jump. Maybe? You got something I can hold this open with? Thank you. Can you hold that, please? Thank you. Hold it up. Thank you. Okay, I see it. Getting it out's going to be a bit tricky, but... Are you okay? Oh, god. Oh, my god... Eli, this is Scott. We just lost the connection. What the heck is going on down there? - <i>Say again?</i> - We've lost the connection. The doctor is gone. Maybe there's too much interference with all the enemy fire on the shields? - Fix it. - What? I'm guessing as it is! Sorry, you're on your own. You get that thing out of him. Shields aren't gonna last much longer. There's nothing I can do. - How long till we jump? - Just over a minute. Get that thing out of him, or I'm gonna have to! He's coming to! Hold him down, hold him down! - Give him a dose of anesthetic. - What are you doing to me? Hold him steady. I can see it. I need you to hold this. There it is. All right, I got it. Now pull it out. We got it. Shields are barely registering! We're jumping! Okay, we can close him up. Nice work. How'd we do, sir? The ship's taken some damage. Eli's looking into it. Anyway... we're still here. All right, everyone, I need all of you to head back into your quarters now. Everyone. Sir, we can't guard 'em all if we let them split up. It's over, Sergeant. All right, people, you heard the man. Let's go. I'm open to suggestions. Obviously, we need to find a way to work together. Pretend it never happened, you mean. You shouldn't have left him.
