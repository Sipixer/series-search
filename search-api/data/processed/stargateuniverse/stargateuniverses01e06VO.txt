of thousands of years ago. Where the hell are we? Several billion light years from home. We are on a ship, but we have no idea where we are in relation to Earth. This ship could be the most important discovery mankind has made since the Stargate itself. These are the wrong people, in the wrong place. We've got a lot of wounded. We need to get home. We barely have enough power to operate the main systems. This ship simply doesn't have the capability to dial Earth. I read about these Chinese miners that survived a cave-in for six days by drinking their urine. I'm gonna go ahead and pretend I didn't hear. You know what they ate? Coal. - Coal? - It's a true story. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty stupid. Almost killed them. Water level's down. Nobody went near that compartment on your watch? Spencer asked if he could have a look in the tank. - Why? - He's a crazy person. Sir. I said no. Nobody goes in there without my authorization. Maybe it evaporated when we went through the star. - It's a closed system. - All that water went somewhere. We're down to half of what we had when we got here. I don't understand this. You're the one trying to get the recycling system up. - Maybe there's a leak somewhere. - Ship says it's fine. - If what you're saying is accurate... - It is. - We've got a serious problem. - We wouldn't. - If you did what I asked you to do. - Can we stick to one problem at a time? Running out of water wouldn't matter if we just dial Earth and go home. - I explained that to you. - The ship's recharged. - The power reserves are full. - That's the point, they're not! Where are we at? Probably about less than 40% of original design capacity. I can't tell when someone pulls a number out of his ass? What? I actually pulled that number out of my ass. He's not making it up. If Destiny was ever capable of dialing back to Earth, it was thousands of years ago, when the Ancients intended to come here. But not now. You're right. We have a problem. - Yes. - Again. Get Brody in on this. He's an engineer. I need to borrow, Eli. - 40,000 liters? - That's what I heard. We didn't drink it. It wouldn't surprise me if there was more water than they're telling us. They're hoarding it? It's a big ship. You know the military. Long as they control the water supply, they control us. Yeah, I'm talking about you. Those two are harmless. Keep it up. I need to know who I can trust. I feel like a spy. Clean this room up. Right. Projet-SG (1.00) - What is it? - Nothing, sir. Just had a strange feeling. - We just dropped out of FTL. - Wasn't that. I'm on my way to the gate room. There's a planet in range. Come on. - What have we got? - There's only one planet in range. The ship's already dialed it up. We're getting readings now. Looks like we entered the Hoth system. Empire strikes back. The second <i>Star Wars</i> movie. I refuse to call it <i>Episode V</i>. Minus 47 degrees Celsius. Bundle up. Is that water ice? But the atmosphere is dangerously thin. And poisonous. 13% molecular oxygen, 95% carbon dioxide, with a hint of argon. Nasty planet. The only candidate within range. We're gonna have to use the spacesuits we found. But if that brings back a half a ton of ice, I'll take it. Shut it down for now. Lieutenant Scott, come in, please. There a reason your radio's off? Come in. Colonel Young is looking for you. - I think I'd better... - Go, go. What, you couldn't find a broom closet? We're still working on the other suits. We're close to having a third one ready. - How close? - A day, maybe? We'll be back in FTL by then. Well, they're not in great shape. All these years, there's bound to be degradation. Keep at it, we're going to need them. Looks like it's just you and me, then. I could take Kennair, sir. - She's done EVAs before, you're... - I'm fine. How are we gonna cut the ice? Plasma cutter. Should cut through the ice like butter. Just don't get the business end anywhere near you. Suit radios are voice-activated between you. Press here if you want to tie into the ship's communication systems. You're in command while we're gone. - Is everybody clear on that? - I'm sure we'll manage. Start dialing. Assuming a fair amount of physical activity, you have just over eight hours of air. It's what, 11 hours until the next jump to FTL, right? Don't worry. You'll run out of air long before we leave you behind. Thanks. Beautiful? One deep breath, and you're dead. Destiny, this is Young. Come in. Yes, sir, we hear you five by five. I've just tested the ice by the Stargate.</i> I read concentrations of ammonia and several other toxic chemicals. How high are the readings? Off the charts. You could try looking farther afield. Maybe on the other side of that lake. Is that really a good idea? The further from the gate we go, the less ice we can bring back.</i> I've got just the thing. Give me two minutes. Colonel, give us five. Eli has an idea. Maybe there's fresh water in the lake under the ice. At minus 47, the ice will be 10 feet deep. We're better off finding a pressure ridge. Sounds like you've done something like this before. A million times. Did you feel that? It's just a tremor. You know, the last planet I was on exploded. Destiny, this is Young. We're burning through suit air. What's going on with this bright idea? Here we come, people! Here we come! Sorry, it's impossible to steer by remote. That's fantastic, Eli. What made you come up with that? Actually, it represents my most recent attempt to fly, but it should carry a ton of ice. Colonel, we're sending through Eli's latest invention. I love it! The man gets a gold star. How much will it hold? More than you can carry by yourself. All right, we're heading out. Keep the gate active. We'll radio back when we find something. Sir? - <i>Listen, if we don't make it back...</i> - You will. We're two guys in million-year-old space suits walking around alone on an ice planet. If we don't make it back... you're going to do fine. Yes, sir. Good luck. - The level's dropped. - Again? Nobody's been in or out. Brody said there's no leak, so that leaves one alternative. - Who could steal that much? - That's a lot of water. I know, I don't know what else to do. It wouldn't hurt to know where we stand. Start a search. Let's go, Gorman. Dial it up again, Mr. Riley. We must maintain communication. It just went off a second ago. Your timing is perfect! Because it's been 38 minutes, the maximum time a Stargate can remain open. See, I didn't know that. It's Dr. Rush. What's your status?</i> We've found an exposed area of ice that looks promising. Testing now. We're pretty far out. Can't see the gate anymore. It's still worthless. Keep looking. Go ahead. I found something. So did I. Can it wait? It's Spencer. I can deal with him myself if you'd like, but...</i> No, it's fine. I'll be on my way. I didn't steal anything! - What's this? - Those are mine! I brought them through with me when we evacuated! You brought them through with you? Give me a reason. Back off! I don't have time! Lock him up. The Colonel can deal with him when he gets back. You said you found something. To be honest, I don't know what I saw. I have to talk to Rush. You keep searching. Nothing we find is going to add up to what's missing. I know, but we have to know what we've got. No one's gone near the tank, and it keeps going down. Come on, come on... Destiny. This is Young. We got pure ice.</i> That's excellent news. It's a frozen waterfall. We should be able to break it up into manageable pieces and haul it back.</i> We'll be ready for you. Busy day on Destiny. I haven't taken anything. I don't think you have. What are you doing? Checking for stolen rations. It's okay, Dr. Franklin. Confess, Miss Armstrong. You drank 40,000 liters of water. - He's kidding. - I know. I'm just saying, we have rights. I'm done here, Miss Armstrong. I hope I haven't inconvenienced you. I understand. I knew that you would. You. Next. This is never gonna be enough. Stand back. - You've done this before, have you? - At least five times. You mind if I give it a shot? Remember, all we have are the bullets we brought with us. So, are we talking about, like, one little cloud of bugs, or are they all over the ship? I'm not even sure that "bugs" is the right word for them. - What about "cloud?" - Except the cloud was alive. It was almost like thousands of tiny... alien creatures. I have a problem with everything you just said. What you've just described is... it's the same as Lieutenant Scott claimed he saw on the desert planet. That's what I was thinking, and maybe some of them followed him. - Wouldn't we have noticed them? - Not if only a few came through the gate. They're like tiny grains of sand. And then what, started reproducing? If it's a living organism, then, they would. So now we've got aliens. What if they start bursting out of our stomachs? I don't think they're dangerous. It almost felt like they were trying to communicate. Lieutenant Scott used the same word. - You said he was delirious. - I was wrong. What's your plan? I guess we should stop everyone from wandering around the ship. After you. Here? This is Lieutenant Johansen. We have a situation. It's under control, but as a precaution, I ask everyone to return to their quarters and remain there until further notice. Thank you. You're... - you're not going to tell them? - That we've got aliens? We'll keep it on a need-to-know basis. What else? You're in charge. And I'm asking your advice. What else? Always consider the greater good. That's it. That's enough ice for now. Let's get out of here. Gorman, meet me in the gate room. We have ice on the way.</i> Copy. They're on it. Dial it back, please. Destiny, this is Young. How's it going up there?</i> Offloading the sled now. Hurry it up. We want to do one more run. Just so you know, another matter has come up. - We have it under control. - We have aliens on the ship. What? They just shredded Gorman. What the hell does that mean? Millions of tiny flying razor blades floating around the ship like piranha. Corporal Gorman is alive. Lieutenant Johansen is tending to him. He's probably not gonna make it. - That's it. We're coming back. - That's not necessary, Colonel. Eli is overreacting. We believe the creatures are the same as those Lieutenant Scott encountered on the planet. They must have followed us back through the gate.</i> I doubt those things I saw were dangerous, sir. They helped me. Gorman may have provoked them. - We'll know more once he comes to. - If he comes to. In the meantime, Lieutenant Johansen has ordered everyone to remain in their quarters. They're nothing more than a nuisance at this point,</i> but we desperately need more ice. All right. We'll figure out what to do with them when we get back. Sending the sled back through now. Rush out. You're gonna have to learn when to shut up. You can't just lie to the guy and expect... Once back into FTL, it could be days before we find another planet capable of replenishing our water supplies. This ice represents a fraction of what we need to stay alive. - We need more! - I know! - But that doesn't mean you can... - It does! - You're making it sound like we're... - Just stop acting like a child, please! We have to figure this out. I said "we." I say we torch 'em. You know, put some teams together, hunt them down. - Where'd you get that? - I can invent things too. - We've really got to work together... - Maybe the bugs were responding - out of self-defense. - Self-defense? Did you see what they did to Gorman's face? I'm the one treating him, Sergeant. I saw exactly what they did to his face. Look, we don't know what it is we're dealing with, and "torching" them may only serve to antagonize them further. - We hit them with something else. - Revenge, that's great. We got to do something. If we just sit around till they drink all of our water, then we're gonna... Alien bugs show up and half our water disappears. Don't tell me I'm the only one who... Obviously not. The question is, what are we gonna do about it? Sergeant, you and your team go search for this alien... entity, cloud, bugs, whatever it is we're calling them, - and report back, okay? - Yes, ma'am. And Sergeant. - No torching. - Yes, ma'am! I have an idea! It's gonna be dark soon. Stand back. Nothing's happening. Yes, there is. It's like vapor. We just can't see them. That's what they did when I saw them. They disappear. So they're growing in numbers exponentially, and consuming our resources without us even knowing it. You have to get them off the ship. Sergeant Greer, come in. I'm a little busy right now. The bugs are getting into the water tank every time we open the hatch. Once we locate the main swarm, we're gonna have... They're in front of me right now. Don't antagonize them. I won't, unless they antagonize me first. Do they move when you do? They do now. What we need is an airlock. Unfortunately, there are none in the habitable compartments of the ship. I know what to do. This isn't gonna keep us going very long. Maybe Destiny will figure out we're getting short on water and find us a planet with nice fresh water right next to the Stargate. Come on, we deserve a break. Can you hear me? I'm sorry, sir, the ice just gave way. Are you hurt? Negative. I'm okay, but... I'm wedged in pretty good. Good thing, too. Looks like a long way down. All right, just hold on. I'm gonna... I'm gonna throw a line down. Here it comes. I need you to tell me when you've got it. Got it. Now, if you can manage it, run it under both your arms and fasten it across your chest. Done this before, too, have you? At least a dozen times. Now, I want you to pull yourself up. I'm gonna pull from this end. You ready? One, two, three! Pull! Pull, Scott! Come on! Pull! How stuck are you? Pretty dang stuck. Is there any way you can dig yourself out? I'm not sure. That's okay. That's passed. Still here, sir. All right, let's just... let's think about this for a second. Destiny, this is Young. Go ahead. We've got a situation here. There was a tremor and Scott fell through the snow into a crevasse.</i> He's fine, but he's just out of reach.</i> I tried to pull him up, but that's not gonna happen soon. How's that other space suit coming? We stopped work on that. I confined everyone to quarters. All right, it was just a thought. We'll figure it out. How's your bug situation? Same as before. Don't worry about it. Don't you worry either, T.J. I'll be out of here in no time. Good luck. Johansen out. Everyone is lying. Grown-ups do that. This is Greer. It's working. They're moving away from us as we move forward.</i> Good job. Keep it up. How about you lower the gun down, and I shoot myself free? That's good thinking. There's no way the bullets will ricochet into your ass. Maybe I can cut my way out with the plasma cutter. You get one hole in that suit, you're dead. Maybe there's a way for me to get down there. That's just as stupid. "That's just as stupid, sir." The last thing we need is for both of us to be stuck down here. You okay? Closed in a little tighter, but I think... What? What? I think I'm losing suit pressure. I thought we were supposed to be confined to quarters. I heard over the radio... there was a tremor. Lieutenant Scott fell into a crevasse. Oh, my god. He's okay. Just... stuck. - Do they have enough air? - Young says he's got it under control. I just... thought you would want to know. Thanks. I think the ice tore a hole in his suit. How big a tear is it? I can't see it, but I can hear it. It's hissing out pretty good. An hour at most. Plenty of time to make it back. If I wasn't stuck! You have to consider the amount of time you have left now. I'm aware of the damn time, Rush. All I'm saying is if you delay much longer... Listen to me! I know what you're saying,</i> and I'm not going anywhere without him and that's the way it's going to be! What's the matter with you? Miss Armstrong, - you should return to your quarters. - You know where you can go? Look, Colonel, I understand your desire to rescue Lieutenant Scott, of course, and only you can decide how much time you have left,</i> but Lieutenant, if Colonel Young remains there, trying to free you, to pull you up by himself, there's a chance he might not make it back. He's right. Just keep the gate active. We're gonna make it back in time with your ice, which is all you really care about. Young out! Damn, he's a lot of work. This is Greer. I locked them up. Closing off the ventilation in that room. Vents are closed. Should be airtight. What are they doing? Looking for a way out. Let's hope they don't find one. Come on! Come on... Sir... I'm thinking. Go. It's okay. No, it's not. Come on, sir. We both know you've done this before, too. Done what? Lost people. Too many times. I'm not... I'm not doing it again. I can't let you do it. You don't have a choice. Not that I'm counting, but this is the third time in almost as many weeks that you've been willing to kill yourself, there's a pretty good chance at this point I won't be around to talk you out of it again. You're a fine, young Officer. You've got a heart as big as a house, and I'm not here because I want to die. I'm here because I haven't given up on saving your ass, so just shut up and think. They're gettin' pissed off. Really pissed off. A few of them got out. What? How? We need a plan, Lieutenant! I'm coming down there! This is beautiful out here. Wake up, Scott! Wake up! I need you to wake up, Scott! Scott, come on! Wake up! Come on! Come on, I got you. That's it, pull! Pull. Come on, Lieutenant. That's it. That's it, I got you. You're okay. Scott, come on. Hang on, kid. What's the plan? We open the door, they go for the water, we close the lid. All right, who's gonna do that? I am. - I will. - I'm not the one with the torch. Look, I am not going to let you do that... I haven't killed any of them. You are. I'll stand back, torch them. - I want you out of sight. - What, you don't trust me? I don't. All right. Eli, I'm ready. Make us a clear path to the gate room. Seal off everything else. You're good. If this doesn't work, lock this compartment off from the rest of the ship. Destiny, this is Young. I'm on my way back with Scott. Come in. Let 'em out. I got 'em! All right, dial the gate. We're on our way. I'm almost at the Stargate with Scott. Shut it down so I can... dial in. Colonel, we're about to send these alien bugs through to the planet. - <i>We've no other choice.</i> - What? We need you to step away from the gate and remain as still as possible. They're coming through now. Get his helmet off. Give her a hand. His pulse's thready, but he's breathing. Let's get him out of here. Sergeant Spencer, you step out of line again, I will deal with you personally. Understand? Yes, sir. I don't think he does. I need to talk to you about the behavior of one of yours. That can wait. We need to go over the new rationing amounts I was scheduled to use the communication stones this morning... At approximately 03:00 hours ship time, Corporal Gorman succumbed to injuries sustained in an encounter with an alien entity. Lieutenant Johansen did everything that she could.
