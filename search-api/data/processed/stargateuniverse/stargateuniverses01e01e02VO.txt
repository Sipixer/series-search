This is Scott, slow down the evac! We are coming in too hot! Colonel, come in! My God, where are we? What is this place? Get them off the gate! Where are we? - What is this? - Why didn't we come through to Earth? There was no time to explain! Off to the side! What's going on? This is Scott, come in! Colonel, come in! - I need a medic! - Over here! - Can you move your fingers? - No, I think my arm's broken. Okay, just hold your arm there, and we'll put it in a sling, okay? Keep calm, keep calm. Clear this area, there could still be more incoming! - Are you okay? - Yeah. Oh, God. Move, move. Where the hell are we? - Where's Colonel Young? - He was right behind me. - Move, move, move. - Quiet. - Stay calm! - Excuse me. Keep it down! Move, move. Colonel... Colonel? Don't move. - Where are we? - I don't know, sir. Are you... Sir... You're in charge, all right? Yes, sir... - I'm coming! - Clear the crowd, people. - Coming through! - Let's go, move, move! Is he okay? I don't know. - What is this place? - Look, I just did what Rush told me to. - Where is he? - I don't know he went through... - Eli, help me find him. - Well, I... What in the hell was that? I don't know. Sergeant, I need you to get these people settled, and you find out who and what we've got. Nobody leaves this room. Yes, sir. Eli! Now! The core of the planet is the power source. You have to channel it into the weapon to destroy the ship. - Can't do it, dude. - Doin' it. It's a programmer's jokes, a problem unsolvable.</i> Already solved it. - No, you didn't. - Just shut up! And watch this... - What the hell! - What happened? Nothing happened. - I'm back at the beginning. - You're so full of yourself. No. It worked. The firing code locked in. Whatever. That was extremely unsatisfying. Eli Wallace? Actually, Eli's not here right now. Okay, whatever you guys think that I did I swear, you've got the wrong guy. Do I look like someone who would be standing here if I didn't already know everything there is to know about you? - Yeah, not really. - Right. Who are you? Dr. Nicholas Rush. May we come in? Why? You've spent a great deal of time recently playing an online fantasy game called Prometheus. Big brother's got nothing better to do? Last night, you solved the Dakara weapons puzzle. Yeah, a month of my life went into that. You know what happens when you solve that thing? Nothing. We're here. That happened. To complete that particular puzzle, you had to solve a millennia-old mathematical proof written in another language, for that, you've won something of a prize. Well, whatever it is, i'll take the cash equivalent. There isn't one. It's a non-disclosure agreement. Non-disclosure? So you guys really embedded a top secret problem into a game hoping someone... like me would solve it? So, what do you need me for now? I assure you, it'll be worth your while to sign it. - And if I don't? - We'll beam you up to our spaceship. Right. I think I want my lawyer to look over it first. And by "lawyer," I assume you mean "mother." So we'll just agree then that I will call you. What the... Welcome aboard the Hammond, Eli. Yes, that is the planet Earth, and yes, you are on a spaceship. We need your help, Eli. To be honest, I don't know how long it's going to take. I should call my mom... - Tell her where I am. - That's probably not gonna work up. Right. You can speak to her on the way. There's a cover story to follow. I'm sorry. On the way to... To another planet, 21 light years from here. I can't go. I... - I have things that... - We know about your mother's condition. You just know everything, don't you? We also know you are currently unemployed, and that your mother's medical coverage is... An ongoing issue. We'll see she gets the best care while you're gone. And if I don't sign, what? You're going to erase my memory? Something like that. Can I get some pants? Hello, I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson, and behind me is a Stargate. It was originally built millennia ago by</i> an alien race who we call the Ancients.</i> Over the next few hours we'll be touching on some</i> ... there are 39 symbols representing star constellations</i> as seen from Earth... ... when a connection is made between two Stargates,</i> ... an unstable energy vortex emerges from the gate</i> ... and settles into the event horizon or puddle as we like to call it.</i> Later, it was discovered that using an eighth symbol</i> would actually dial another galaxy in hundred of thousands of light years via an interstellar wormhole... ... it is believed an unprecedented amount of power is required...</i> - ... mysterious ninth chevron... - The first six symbols... Icarus base was establish on a planet discovered two years ago...</i> The entire purpose of the project is to hopefully one day</i> dial the nine chevron address found in the ancient database.</i> Hi! I'm Dr. Daniel Jackson. Now, you've heard the term "hyperspace" for years...</i> - Where are you? - <i>It's top secret.</i> I'm serious, ma. I can't say anything more than that. I don't understand. Why could you not at least tell me you were leaving? I'm sorry, but did you get the letter from... Yeah, the Air Force, I got it. Are you in a plane now? - You sound like you're in an airplane. - No. It's nothing like that. I want you to know that they're going to look after you. You didn't have to do this. This is good. Really, it's the kind of thing I always dreamed of. Hi. You mind? No, go ahead. Thank you. First time on a spaceship, too? Me? I've been on lots of... various... - Eli Wallace. - I know. You've heard of me? I have. That almost never happens. - And you are? - Chloe. I work for Alan Armstrong. Senator of California. Yeah, yeah. I have heard of California. My last job was in the burger and fries field. - How'd you line that up? - I was a political science major at Harvard, so... I hear it's a good school. - For a while there, I was at... - MIT. - I know. - Really? What else have they told you about me? - What? - I've seen this writing before. - In the game? - Yeah. We're on a ship? The design is clearly Ancient, in the truest sense of the word. Launched... hundreds of thousands of years ago. Faster than light, - yet not through hyperspace. - What are you doing? Who knows how far it's travelled. We've got a lot of wounded. We need to get home. Lt. Scott, come in. Go ahead. We've got a problem, one of the air vents just shut down in here. Copy that. Yeah, the air's getting pretty thin in here, too. What does that mean? That the life-support system is failing. We should probably do something about that. - Well, it's always just one more year. - It's a command. - Where? - It's a lot safer than other places. You've put your time in, Everett. - When this tour's over, I promise - You know what? Never mind, don't bother. You always end up choosing somewhere other than here. I am not choosing my job over you. How you can even say that to me? I love you, but I can't wait anymore... Are you okay? Sweetheart, baby, look at me. Colonel? Oh, my God. Can't you do something? He's having a seizure. There's nothing I can do. Scott, this is Colonel Young, come in please.</i> Our guests have arrived a few minutes early,</i> what's your position? No, not yet. Lieutenant, drop whatever you're doing and get your ass up here.</i> I'm on my way, sir. Bye. Holy... Senator... It is my honor to welcome you to Icarus base. This is my executive assistant, Chloe. - It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. - The pleasure's mine. She's also my daughter. You must be the... Contest winner, yeah. - That is a big gun. - Rail gun. 500 rounds per minute. This is Lieutenant Scott. He's been assigned to you, Mr. Wallace. Shall we go inside? Unbelievable. Yeah, it is. It's weird how fast you can start to take something like this for granted. So, if a Stargate can instantly transport you to another planet, why did we fly here on a spaceship? Something to do with how this one's tied into the planet for power. Apparently, it's been modified to only dial out because incoming wormholes are too dangerous. You're the genius. You can probably tell me better. All I did was solve a puzzle in a video game. You figured out something doctor Rush has been trying for months, which, by the way, a lot of people were glad to see. You know Colonel Telford. - Ready for this, Colonel? - You just give the word, sir. I gave it quite a while ago, Colonel. I'm just here to see how my $1.6 billion is being spent. Very good. Thank you, everyone. Dismissed. Now, as you know, up until now, we have been unable to channel the precise amount of power necessary to unlock the Stargate's ninth and final chevron. However, thanks to some ingenuity from young Mr. Wallace here, - that problem has finally been solved. - We've heard that before. This time we're sure. That's what I figured out? I embedded the mathematical problem we had to solve into the game. I then engineered your solution into a practical, workable application. - What say we get on with it? - Absolutely. Sergeant Riley... - Chevron 1 encoded. - Sir... We're dialing now? - A test, to see if we can connect. - Chevron one locked. If we do, we'll send an automated reconnaissance drone through. We'll see what's on the other side. Chevron 2 locked. - And then they'll go? - No, first, we close down again, assess the data we receive, and then perhaps send the away team. If it works. Chevron 4 locked... Until then, they're just interested observers like us. Chevron 5 locked. Chevron 6 encoded. Chevron 6 locked. Chevron 7 encoded. Chevron 7 locked. Chevron 8 encoded. Chevron 8 locked. Chevron 9 encoded. What's going on? I don't know, we never got this far before. Chevron 9... Chevron 9... Will not lock. We matched the power requirements down to the EMU. It must work. Power levels in the gate capacitors are going into the red. - Shut it down. - No, wait... - We've fluctuations from the core... - Shut it down now. - It should have worked. - Well, it didn't, - and drawing power from the core is... - Dangerous, we're aware... Regardless of what's been spent, my first priority is to ensure the safety of the people on this base. Of course. Of course... We'd best run through your equations again. You'll excuse me. You are not seriously putting this on me? Not my fault. People, you have to calm down. Seriously, you have to calm down. We got power! Can I have everybody's attention, please? All right, please listen! Listen up! What is going on? We're on an ancient spaceship. What? That's all I've got. Now, what that means is... It means we need to use the Stargate to get us all back home. That is definitely on the list of things to do, - but right now... - It's an order. We're working on it. I need to speak to the person responsible for this. - Where is Dr. Rush? - Just shut up for a second! How dare you talk to me... Dad? Dad, please... Water? - Over here. - Sit down. My pills... Look, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to explain the situation. We are on a ship, but we have no idea where we are in relation to Earth. Now, with respect, sir, the reason you might be having a hard time breathing right now, is because... the ship's life-support system is not functioning properly. Dr. Rush is working on that right now. Brody and Park? - Here. - Here. Okay, good, you two are with me. - But these consoles just came on. - No. Nobody touch anything yet. Dr. Rush needs your help. Everybody else... Just stay calm, stay put. Please. Stay put? What do you mean, you're just going like that? There has to be a mistake in here somewhere. Seriously, who uses a whiteboard anymore? You have computers, like, everywhere around here. Power flow was in the target range. Why wouldn't the address connect? Wrong address? There is only one, found in the ancient database on Atlantis. With no other instructions. No, but that's not the issue. It has to be your proof. My proof works. You know how I know that it does? Because you said so. Gentlemen, how's it coming? - What are you doing? - Starting from the beginning. Wait! Save, save! Mr. Wallace, I would like you to join me for dinner in the officer's mess. We're quite close to a breakthrough, actually. I'd like Eli to keep working. Well, we've been here for six months. It can wait a few more hours. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So, Colonel, you really have no idea where this ninth-chevron Stargate address is going to send you? No idea at all. But the Ancients built the Stargate with nine chevrons. It's got to go somewhere. ... we've also known for some time the only way to unlock the ninth chevron was to solve the power issues. Well, if anyone's going to solve it, I think Eli will. That's right. It's true... I am Mathboy. - I would like to propose a toast. - No, that's really not necessary. Not to you. When the proposal for this project first crossed my desk, I did not want to approve it. It seemed clear to me at the time there were enough terrestrial matters of importance that needed that money. Now, being a proud father of a beautiful young woman is one thing. Having that young woman exceed every... possible expectation is quite another. It was my daughter, Chloe, who reminded me that there was no greater endeavor than seeking an understanding of who we are - and the mysteries of the universe. - Not in those exact words. It was also her idea to embed the ancient proof in a medium that would give us access to brilliant young minds that we'd have overlooked. And so, to all the brave men and women who have volunteered... What was that? This is Young. The base is under attack. All non-combatant personnel report to your designated areas, everyone else to your battle stations. This is not a drill. Senator, I need you and your daughter to go with Lieutenant Scott. Eli, you as well. What's going on in here? The life-support system is on, but for some reason, it's not working properly. I'm attempting to reset it. He has no idea what he's doing. Step away from that thing. - That screen says what you're doing... - Eli, please! - Is that what it says or not? - You know what it says in this screen because I embedded a rudimentary version of the ancient language into the game. - This is not a game. - Don't touch it, Rush. When the oxygen aboard this ship falls below critical level, it will become increasingly difficult to concentrate. What you're doing could blow the whole ship. Are you sure? Back off now, or I will shoot! Lower your weapon! He already screwed us once. I'm not going to let him do it again! I need to get through, people. Stand aside. We're under attack. Don't know who, don't know why. Consider the charges dropped. Go take your anger out on them. Yes, sir. What do we got, Lucian alliance? That would be my guess. They haven't introduced themselves. They started shooting the minute they came out of hyperspace.</i> Our shields are holding, but we're not the target. What's heading our way? A full squadron of gliders and a troop transport.</i> We cut them down some, but the rest will be on your doorstep in 3 minutes. Did you copy? If we can get to the transport before they land their troops, we stand a chance. I'm going to press that button. It's going to fix the life-support, and then you and I and everyone else will be able to breathe and think much better. Don't do it. Look, I know we are in a tough situation here, but I am giving you an order. Lower your weapon. So? I suppose that would have been too simple. Apparently, that did nothing. This may take a little more time, TJ. Hang in there. Copy. Does Colonel Young know about this? He knows. Two weeks ago, you told me that this was the best experience of your life. Something must have happened. The scholarship came in. I guess I've just been too afraid to admit what I really want. You didn't tell me you had even applied. There's nothing else going on. You know I'd tell you. - Unless you were protecting someone... - I'm not. Like I said, I just hadn't made up my mind. I'm reading a dangerous energy spike in the core. - I need your help. - With what? - The ninth chevron. - What? - We need to get the hell out of here! - It took us 2 years to find this site. The properties are unique. This may be our last chance. If this bombardment continues, the radioactive core's going to go critical. You mean the planet, it's going to explode? - If my math works... - We can't assume that... I said "if". Then if it works, then it's not a power supply issue, it's the gate address. We've known the first eight symbols. The ninth has to be the point of origin. What if we're not on the planet you're supposed to be dialing from? - This is where we are. - What if we aren't supposed to be here? Icarus base, Telford. We can't hold 'em back.</i> Let's go! Go! Sergeant Riley, dial the Stargate to Earth! Take cover! Chevron one locked. Follow me, the symbols on the Stargate are constellations as seen from Earth, that's what you said? What if Earth is supposed to be the point of origin? The only viable power source was here, light years away. What if that doesn't matter? What if it's the only combination that will work, like a code. A code? Chevron four encoded. - Stop the dialing sequence. - I have my orders. Get out of my way, get out of the way! We can't risk dialing Earth. Come on, let's go. Dad? Dad! My father! There could still be people trapped on the other side. All right, let's go, people! You need to move it to the gateroom! This is Scott. I got about a dozen or so people cut off from the gateroom, south-east corridor. Dammit... - Is that Dr. Simms? - Stay with me. He was helping pull people back from the surface. Simms, can you hear me? No! Come on, we got to go. That is impressive. Power's fluctuating at critical levels. Colonel, I'm detecting a massive build-up of energy from the planet! Recall our fighters. Radio Colonel Telford he's got 2 minutes to get his people aboard before we jump to hyperspace! What's everybody doing? I ordered an evacuation! He didn't dial Earth. It's the ninth chevron address. What? The attack started a chain reaction in the planet's core, there's no way of stopping that, and any blast could easily translate through an open wormhole. It's too dangerous to dial Earth. - You could have dialed somewhere else. - This is our only chance. - Shut it down. - We can't, it's too late... System's not responding. - I need to save these people. - We have a way out. We don't know what's on the other side! Can't be worse than here, can it? Nobody move! Await further instructions. What's that? - It doesn't look like life-support. - I realize that. What are we looking at? It's a star map. That's the Milky Way. I believe it's a visual log of the ship's journey. This is where we are now? No. That's where the ship originally embarked from. Earth. It's leaving the galaxy. It did. Long ago. That was Pegasus. So those points are more stars? No... they're galaxies. Where the hell are we? Several billion light years from home. Stand clear. - You could take down the roof with it. - No time for argue. I need you to lead the evacues. You need to go with him. No, I'm staying here until I know my father's okay. Make sure everyone carries as much of the expedition supplies as they can. Why? You're not going to Earth. Rush dialed the ninth chevron. Go. Go! Once I'm through, follow one at a time on a three-count! You good? Okay, let's go. If you can hear me, stand back! Okay, get down. Fire in the hole! Dad? Dad? Put your weight on me... Keep calm, everybody. - I got you. - Please... Everybody, stay calm! Don't push! Dad! Careful, careful... You're okay, sir. - Are you okay? - I'm the last one. I'm all right. Go. I'm right behind you. Hammond, this is Young, come in. Hammond, this is Young. Come in. Let's go, let's go, come on, people. Let's do it, let's do it. - Sir! - Go! We've got Colonel Carter. On screen. General, we barely got away. The planet was destroyed. We managed to beam most of our people off the surface before jumping to hyperspace. We also believe that the enemy forces were destroyed.</i> Any word on how they gained intel on our base?</i> No. What about casualties?</i> 12. 80-plus MIA. The bunker-shielding technology prevented us from beaming out anyone inside. How many people made it through the gate to Earth? None. None? Our sensors indicated that the Stargate was active</i> for a full six minutes before the core went critical.</i> They didn't come through here. Then where'd they go? Okay, listen up! Everybody who is able, we are going to search this ship top to bottom. Teams of three. - Weapons? - 23, including handguns. - One per group? - Yeah. Flashlights, radios... only when necessary. Once those batteries are dead, they are dead. Regular check-ins with Dr. Rush in the control room every 10 minutes, and keep in mind, as far as we know, this bucket is really freakin' old, and there may be areas of damage where life-support is unstable. Look, be smart, okay? Don't touch anything that looks like it might be dangerous. How are we supposed to know what's dangerous? - Becker, right? - Yes, sir. I work in the mess. I mean, I did. Well, don't touch, just look. You're James, right? Yes, Lieutenant. You and Riley are with me. Subtle, man, subtle... If it's okay with you, sir, it might be best, given your obvious skills, if you could hang back here, help keep the rest of these people calm. Don't patronize me, son. No, sir. Are you all right? I'm solid, Lieutenant. I'm trained for this. - Look, I didn't mean... - Look, not now. Rush, this is Scott, come in. Rush, this is Scott, come in. Hello. This is Eli. Where's Rush? Bathroom, if he found it. I'm at what looks like a bulkhead door. It won't open. I was hoping Rush could open it from there.</i> Should I find him? No. - Here, give me a hand. - What happened to being smart? This could be the engine room. We got to at least open a few doors. Do we? Do we really? Hang on. No, keep doing what you're doing. I think I found where you are. The door is flashing red. Can you open it? Red is usually bad, isn't it? Maybe the door is stuck. Just try it.</i> You should probably step back. Not good, not good, more red! Close it! - Close it now! - I'm trying! Okay, we established why that hatch was closed. A lot of others are closed for the same reason. We're only occupying a fraction of the ship right now. It goes on forever, but if there are damaged areas that aren't sealed,</i> that could be our problem. Good timing. We just found... Really? This is Dr. Rush. Meet me in the gateroom immediately. Everyone. What's going on? In this case are five ancient communication stones. They work over vast distances in real time. We can talk to the people on Earth. Yes. You physically take control of an individual at the other end. I brought these with us in the event we ended up somewhere out of range of normal communication. So let's use them. I already have. Are they sending help? No. - Why? Why are they not sending help? - The only means of dialing this gate from our galaxy was destroyed in the attack. We're cut off. - I want to use one of those stones now. - I have spoken with General O'Neill. - I am a United States Senator! - I've explained our situation clearly. In light of my knowledge and experience, - he has placed me in charge. - He did what? I have faith in our ability to repair the ship, and to work together, but if we're to survive this, we need leadership and a clear chain of command. We only have a few hours of air left. - I want to speak to the General. - Please. Give it to him! Dad? Dad! Excuse me. Okay. Okay, he's still breathing. Oh, my God! - I saw him taking some pills? - Warfarin, for his heart. Blood-thinners are the last thing he needs if he's bleeding internally. - Please do something! - I told you, I'm just a medic. Everyone, please, there's no need for us all to congregate in the one place. Ms. Johansen, please find adequate accommodation for the injured, - and everyone else... - No, I don't recognize your authority. As an IOA representative, I think you, ... much more comfortable. Please go there, and stay there, until you're asked to do something useful. Something useful? We do not want to settle in! We want to get back! Right? We should be working on getting home. - Exactly. - I'm not sure if that's even possible. What? You haven't even tried! Maybe you should actually do something instead of standing around - talking about being in charge. - If that's even true. Everybody! Everyone, calm down! Now, the fact is, Colonel Young put me in charge, and I expect all SG personnel to follow my orders! As for the rest of you, you get out of line, we will lock you down. Now, Dr. Rush is right about a couple things. First off, we all have to work together. And second of all, we don't all have to stay here, so... Let's move out. Come on, move. It's okay. You heard him... I think we need you... So I've got your back for now, but if I were you, I would find some way to dial that gate back to Earth. I've got some testing equipment over here. Looks broken. - We'll get back to that. - What about all these ancient crates? If it's not ours, don't touch it. Did no one think of labeling anything? Every case has a bar code. All right, anyone find a bar code reader? Guess that got left behind along with the food and water. We got food. Yeah, protein bars, and this powdered stuff. Look, everybody. Seeds? Volker, you've got to be kidding. - I got a case of blank paper. - We should start a suggestion box. What are you staring at? You were in detention. - For good reason. - What did you want him to do, leave me there? Of course not. I was just wondering what to do about it now. That's not up to you. We'll see. No, no. Don't do it. I need you to help check for any open bulkhead doors</i> that lead to damaged parts of the ship. Rush will direct you.</i> Copy. There should be an elevator directly ahead.</i> Copy that. Are you there yet? This is Scott. Radio silence, please. What's going on? We almost lost you. You were thrown clear across the room. Where are we? Where are we? We're on a ship. It's ancient. Rush says it's thousands of years old, and we're... pretty far off into the universe. What's he doing to get us home? He says he's working on it, but we have bigger problems. The life-support system isn't working properly. If we can't get it fixed, there's not much time. You should also know that he used the communication stones, and he said General O'Neill put him in charge. I don't think so. I don't think... Sir, you shouldn't be trying to get up just yet, okay? I don't think I have a choice, TJ. I can't feel my legs. Jeez! What is that thing? Come here, I'll show you. It's a camera. It's a flying camera. I'm calling it a kino, you know, after the Russian... I figure maybe we can use it to check out the damaged areas. - That's good. - Yeah. That's good. Where's it going now? I don't know, it's just doing its thing, but there's lots more of 'em. - Yeah, it's cool. - Yeah. Do you want one? It's not a gumball machine, Eli. Okay, so you figured out where they keep the kinos, what else have you figured out? Give me a break, man. This is my second spaceship, and my first was yesterday. I know. Icarus was my first SGC assignment after training. I haven't been at this much longer than you have. Did they beam you out of your house? No, you got me there. Got any food on you? No. Tylenol? Headache? Yeah. Me too. Neuroproaxia is a temporary paralysis that can follow a concussive injury. You don't know? You'd need an MRI and a qualified doctor who knows how to read it to know for sure if there's spinal damage. We don't have either. Hopefully, it's just the nerves in shock. Best I can do is insist that you remain still. Your tour was over two weeks ago. You should be in some classroom in San Diego. Seattle. That's where my scholarship was. I'm sorry. That part's not your fault. Tell Rush I want to see him. Yes, sir. What's that? Flying camera ball. - I'm calling it a kino... - Don't ask. That's marvellous. It comes with a remote. I thought we could use to look around. What do you have? It's not so good, really. These processing nodes are scrubbers, responsible for cleaning CO2 from the air. Here, here, and here. It's indicating malfunctioned. Others are failing. Greer, this is Scott. I'm heading for the gateroom. Meet me there. Look, I'm just saying that she better stay out of my face. I'll remind her of your personal space issues next chance I get. Col. Young wants to see you. There should be a kind of grate covering the node. What do you see? A problem. We see a very big problem. What happened? You collapsed. We brought you here. What's going on? - I'm not sure. I've been here with you. - You need to know what's happening. This is important. Dad, I was worried about you. And I'm scared. One step at a time, honey. One step at a time. My pills... No, daddy, you can't take any more of those. Your ribs are badly bruised. You will bleed internally. If I don't take those pills, a bruise is gonna be the least of my problems. I know. Don't worry about me. - Find out what's going on out there. - No, I want to be here with you. And I want you here, but right now, I want to know what's going on just a little bit more. I'll be here when you get back. What's going on? I don't know. The air filter's full of crap. Come on, they want us to keep looking. Let's go. All right, okay. Alkaline. Everyone's heart rates are elevated, people are reporting headaches... What? The used-up residue of whatever magic compound the ancients used to scrub CO2 from the air. So now we have two big problems relating to the life-support. Our first priority must be to seal off any of the leaks. If we can manage that, then... we can maybe buy ourselves a day or so before the build-up of CO2 kills us. As it stands, how much time do we have? I don't know. Couple of hours at most. Awesome. Brody, there was... some medical-grade soda lime in the supply manifest? It never made it. That's a pity. In a ship this old... There's bound to be... systems past their designed life. Okay, let's say we find the leaks. Can you fix this? I doubt this stuff can be cooked off. Perhaps if there were stores of this substance in a clean form, or something else capable of CO2 sequestration, calcium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, then... yes, "if". That's not going to matter because you're going to get the gate dialed back to Earth before this becomes an issue, Rush, right? That's the thing you're taught to say in officer training presumably for the benefit of those that don't know any better. Please. What makes you think I won't try? I found what looks like a shuttle. Looks like there are two shuttles attached to individual docking sleeves. - We're all going to die. - Shut up, Franklin. I'm just saying what everyone's got to be thinking. I said, shut up, or else you're going to be first. This the door? Yeah, yeah, that's it. Can you close it? It won't close. We can't close it from here, either. There's something wrong with the mechanism. I think I found the leak. There's another door on the back of the shuttle, but there's no control. Then maybe we can close it off locally. The shield keeping the air inside is obviously not 100% effective. It probably wasn't designed to compensate for the amount of damage the ship has sustained. Is there a way of boosting it? At least in the areas we need it? We haven't found a way yet. It seems to be operating at maximum capability. Open the door! That's not good. That's very good, a very good sign. I don't have time for this, do I? Two problems. We're venting atmosphere from a damaged shuttle, and even if we could seal it off, the life-support system in this ship is past its expiration date. We'll build up CO2 to lethal levels within a day. That explains the headache. You already had one. They'll find a way, it's what they do. Most of these people aren't even supposed to be here. - How did the ship get damaged? - We don't know. It seems it's been through a battle, at least the parts we can access. We're still cut off from most of the ship. It's huge. They tried jamming something into the shuttle doorway to keep it open long enough to let the person inside get out... But it just opens again. Some sort of safety mechanism. Like an elevator. Rush says he can't override it. - How long do we have right now? - As it stands... - Rush says if we don't get it closed... - We've got just over an hour. Bad air's better than no air. Guess a day's better than an hour. Someone's got to go in there and close this door. My head is pounding. Heartbeat has accelerated. It's getting harder and harder to breathe, as our very lives are being vented out into space. - That is gonna get old very fast. - This needs to be documented. - No one's going to see that. - How do you know? We made it here. Someone else could, too. If we die, maybe this can help them to find out what happened to us. But we're not dead yet. I'm starting to have slightly blurred vision... What? So how are we going to decide who? I assume we're not going to get any volunteers. What's another day going to buy us? Time... To find a way to survive. May I see the list? I marked the names of anyone injured. Right. We have to find out peoples' skills, background, experience... Doesn't take any special skills to die from asphyxiation! Look, what I'm saying is, it shouldn't be someone with potentially valuable knowledge, or abilities we might need to help us survive beyond this. Are you really suggesting what I think... Doc, half the people on this ship already want to kill you. I don't care. You can't ask someone to sacrifice themselves, period! Politicians ask military personnel to sacrifice themselves for the good of others all the time. If someone doesn't go in there and close that door, we're all going to die. Period. Franklin is still working at the airlock controls locally, but it doesn't look good, sir. Camile's explaing the situation to everyone else on board. I'll do it. - Sir? - This isn't the kind of thing I can ask somebody else to volunteer for. If we're going to make it past this, we're going to need you, sir. I don't know about that. You're doing a pretty good job, Lieutenant. Look at the mess we're in. If that's not proof that we need you... I'm not sure anyone should do it. I don't want someone sacrificing for me. I say we figure this out together while we have time, - or we all die trying. - Listen to me. It needs to be done, and I'm doing it. - Look, sir, you can barely stand. - Help me. The paralysis is temporary, you know that now. You will recover... - I need your help. - No. - It's an order. - I know. You can have me court-martialled when we get home, but I am not gonna help you kill yourself. My father's not in his room. We'll find him. He does not leave this room. He can't have gotten far. - I told him what was going on. - Greer, this is Scott, come in. Greer, do you read? Senator Armstrong is missing. He may be headed your way.</i> He's here. He's got a gun. I don't want to shoot you. I don't think you want to shoot me. - Get out of the way. - Just give me a little more time. Let me try and fix this. I don't have much. Guys, I'm not seeing any change, whatever you just tried,</i> - it's not working! - The problem's obviously mechanical. You can't fix it. Tell me what to do. Dad, no, wait! Open the door! Open the door! - I can't! - Please open the door... He was dead on his feet. Dad, no! I love you. Please open the door... Not him! There's nothing I can do for him here. Help him! Open the door, please!</i> He can't leave me... At least he bought us a day. You! You did this! You killed him! You've killed all of us! Stop! Little help here... Relax. Just get away from me! All of you! Miss Armstrong... You're in shock. Believe me, I understand. Everyone deals with tragedy in different ways. - You're looking for someone to blame. - I'm not looking. I'm sorry about your father. I truly am. He was a good man, and he certainly wouldn't have been my choice, but you must realize, none of this was my fault. I didn't create the situation that forced us here. There was no other way. Miss Armstrong... I know you don't want to hear this just now, but... this ship... This ship could be the most important discovery mankind has made since the Stargate itself. You know the Icarus project was something your father truly believed in, enough to risk his career to support. What difference does it make if we all die? A number of people died during the attack on the base. Some of them I knew very well. I'm sure some had more value than others. As human beings, all of them were invaluable. My point is, I promise you, I will do everything I can to make sure no one gave their life in vain. No one. Please give me a chance. Colonel... We've lost Senator Armstrong. Oh, my God. - He's bought us some time. - To do what? We're working on it. First up is trying to dial the gate back home. - Should you even be on your feet? - No. I am on my feet, and right now we're trying to get home. Camile, I need your help. You know these people. I need you to spread the word. Try to keep things as positive as you can. - I can do that. - Good. I can't believe my dad is gone. I watched him die, and I still just can't accept it. Tell me about him. Why? Man died so I could live. I'd like to know a little more about him. No matter how tired he was, or how long he'd worked, or what was going on in his life, he always had time to listen to me. I'd go on and on. He never preached. He never told me what to do, even though sometimes I wished he would. He would just listen, and then he would tell me that he loved me. The best part was if I'd had a fight with my mom. He never took sides. Oh, God. My mom... He was her whole life. She probably thinks we're both dead. All I know is that he wanted you to go on. I know. I got to get back to the search. You gonna be okay? I don't know. Fair enough. What? What are you doing? Just watched a man die. Don't you even care? Of course I do, and I'm also trying to learn as much as I can, as quickly as I can. That is, in addition to running nine separate searches in the database in the hope of solving our life-support issues. Right. Found anything? Destiny. As in ours? The name of the ship. Translated from Ancient. I've also discovered that they were never here. I thought his was an ancient ship. It is, but they sent it out unmanned, planning to use the gate to get here, when it was far enough out at the end of the universe, but they probably learned to ascend, before that time. Learned to what? Ascension. It's a process, where by consciousness converts to energy, that no longer requires physical form. That wasn't in the video. Well, there's more than one video. We should get back to work. Sorry. I think I got it. It wasn't even that hard to find. It's right here in the dialing program. - You're sure? - Yes, it's an eight-symbol address. You mean you can dial this thing back to Earth? There's no point of origin indicated, there's only 36 symbols on this gate. I'm assuming the ninth symbol represents some x-factor distance equation. Well, I don't care. Start dialing. Don't we want to bring Dr. Rush in on this? Well, you said this wasn't that hard to find? No. Then he probably already knows and didn't tell us. No, no, no... - What? - Someone's dialing the gate. Colonel Young. - You're up. - Nice to see you, too, Rush. I did order you to report to me. Yes. What are you doing? We're trying to dial Earth. - That would be a mistake. - Riley thinks he's found the address. His understanding of ancient is marginal at best. With respect, Doctor, I know enough to recognize a reference to Earth. He says the address wasn't that hard to find, Rush. No, no, this is a complete waste of power we may need. We have the address back, all we need is the right point of origin. And we've got 36 tries. We barely have enough power to operate the main systems. This ship simply doesn't have the capability to dial Earth. - You see, that's news to me. - He didn't tell me that either. I've only just learned myself, you know what I'm doing. Even if it doesn't work the people aboard this ship need to see us at least try. So what, you're gonna drain what little power we have for the sake of morale? How ridiculous. What was that? Anyone near the observation deck? Colonel, it looks like we've dropped out of FTL. Because we were draining power? No, no. If I'm right, the gate should begin to dial any moment. How did you know that? The ship detected a Stargate, on a planet within range that may have what need. What? How the hell are there even Stargates out here? The Ancients sent out a number of unmanned ships ahead of this one. They're programmed to gather data, resources, to manufacture Stargates, and deposit them in habitable worlds. Any relevant information is relayed back here to help plot the course. You're telling me that this ship knows we're in trouble? Yes, because I told it we were. Essentially, we're flying on auto-pilot. This ship may have stopped when it was within range of a Stargate regardless of our need, but I have reason to believe. So, what we need is on the other side of that wormhole. An educated guess, yes. There's only one way to find out. Sir, you can't do that. We have no idea what's on the other side. We can use the kino to find out. I expect that's the purpose of this device. - I'm getting readings over here. - What have we got? Temperature, gravity, atmosphere composition, barometric pressure... Oxygen nitrogen, very little CO2, extremely low humidity. Habitable, but just barely. Good enough. Looks like four other addresses came up here, too. They could be other planets within range. Maybe we should think about dialing them up... No, they're locked out. The ship chose this one. The Stargate is open, all we have to do is step through. What we have to do is put a team together. - Looks like our time might be limited. - What is it? It's a countdown. Just over 12 hours left. What happens then? I suspect we jump back into FTL. Palmer is a geologist. Obviously, she should go. Franklin and Brody are the best of the rest of what we have. - Thanks for the ringing endorsement. - He didn't even mention me. Franklin goes, the others stay. We're still gonna need people working on the problem from this end. I'd like to go. Really? If I can help, then, - Colonel Young, please. - What? You don't think I can handle it? - He's going. - I've been off-world before. You have made a habit out of pulling our asses out of the fire. Eli, you want to go, you're going. The only one I'm questioning right now, is you, Dr. Rush. Well, besides Palmer, I'm the only one who knows what we're looking for. We have 12 hours to find what we need and get back on the ship. - Sure you can't stop it? - We're just along for the ride. Then we may all be better off on the planet. That's another reason why I should go. Someone to assess whether long-term survival there is even an option. All right. I want everyone clear that Scott is in charge of this mission. Let's gear up, let's find whatever supplies we have, and move out. - About Eli. - He volunteered. - He's not trained for this. - Like a lot of the people we got here. I'm gonna need to know what they're made of. He'll slow us down. If he does, you send him back to the gate. Listen, if we're gonna make it, and I'm not talking the next few hours we're gonna need everyone on board to step up.
