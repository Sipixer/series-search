Yes, michael, you do. but please pay attention. Megan connelly, 28, Phd in advanced biochemistry. Cute. She works with dr. lawrence matheson On the human potentiality project. What is it? A government funded effort to enhance physical capabilities Through an experimental hyper-catalyst. Whatever happened to vitamins? I haven't seen you take many vitamins, michael. Unless you count beer as a vitamin. Hey, there are plenty of vitamins in beer. If you drink enough. We'll have to discuss your misunderstanding Of nutrition later, michael. You have an incoming call from sarah. Mike, have you had a chance to review the case file? Kitt and I were just going over it. And by "just," he means "just about to." Gee, sarah, Thanks for installing the backstabbing program. It's really working out. Mike, don't take this case lightly. Hxp enhances the speed, strength, and aggression Of anyone who takes it, Turning them into a living weapon. Hate to see that get out on the streets. If this stuff ends up in the wrong hands, There's no limit to the damage it could cause. I'm on it. We are approaching megan connelly's car. Engage the emp. ENGAGING EMP. EMP EDPLOYED. GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. Need some help? It just died, I don't know what happened. And my phone's totally dead, so I can't call a tow truck. Mine too. I'm just going up the road to balham labs. Want me to call you a tow truck from there? That's where I work. I've never seen you. I'm from trydell insurance. We're looking into a theft at one of the labs. I filed that report. You must be dr. connelly. Megan. Michael knight. Why don't you hop in? I'll give you a ride. Thanks. What's that on your dash? it looks like a snow globe. It's a...gps. But it's--it's busted right now. Gps is activated. Seems like it's working. Yeah, but it's... Not reliable. I've hit a road block. We're still locked out of the GOVERNMENT SECURITY DATABASES, Nsa, dhs, cia, interpol. Billy, if flag's going to have a chance of succeeding, We're gonna need access to those networks. I'll keep at it. Also, since we're short-handed... Yeah? Do you mind taking out some of that trash? Sure, I'll just scoop it up with my phds. BALHAM INDUSTRIES AND LABORATORIES I came in over the weekend. That's when I noticed that the safe was open. And three vials of serum were gone. Any chance it could've been misplaced Or accidentally thrown out? Not really. Dr. matheson's only managed to synthesize a small amount. That's why I'm sure We'll find it logged with the wrong batch. Had you come to me first, megan, I would've explained that to you. Dr. matheson, this is michael knight. He has some questions about the missing serum. I told the military everything I know. Just because the government funded this project Doesn't give you the right to keep harassing me. Yeah, I'm not with the government, dr. matheson. I'm just checking some facts. The fact is, this has been blown out of proportion. If megan had been more discreet-- House system failure... What happened to the lights? Michael, the electrical and communication lines To the complex have been severed. A group of armed men wearing night vision goggles Are rapidly approaching your position. The phone is dead. Dr. matheson, megan, I need you to get down. What? why? Power system failure. Accessing backup system. Emergency generator activated. Bringing emergency generators online. Power system failure. power system failure. NIGHT VISION. Accessing backup system. Go right. Kitt, I need direction and proximity. DISTANE CALCULATING Target is approaching from behind. Tell me when. Emergency generator activation. He's raising the weapon. And preparing to fire. Now. What was that? NIGHT VISION Emergency generators online in 30 seconds. 30 seconds, counting. Two more at your 10:00 coming fast. Three meters... Two... One...now. Hey. Michael, can you hear me? Michael? ten seconds. I've got the serum, boys. No, please, you can't. Let's go! Michael, the emergency generators Are coming online now. Move, move, move! Megan, go get help. Kitt, you gotta stop them when they leave the building. Michael, no one has exited, But security is fast approaching your location. Hold it right there! - Get your hands up! - whoa, guys... This isn't what it looks like. ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾ -==http://www.ragbear.com==- KNIGHT RIDER.2008  117</font> -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- ·­Òë: ýˆÐ¡¶þ Maybeoneday Ö½ºûµû Ð£¶Ô: Âé½« Ê±¼äÖá:ÎÒ°®Ê¨ÐÄÐ¡s</font> So, you just happened to bump into dr. connelly On the side of the road? Yes. Don't you think that's just a little convenient? We know they escaped through the biohazard tunnel, We just don't know why they left you behind. I told you. I have nothing to do with the attack. That's right. You're an insurance adjuster. Yet, you fought off four armed men In total darkness. Tried to fight off four armed men. I ran your i.d. through the system. It came back clean. The only problem is, no one's ever heard of you. What do you make of that? Well, I'd say you talked to the wrong people. Colonel. Lieutenant templeton benedict, sir. I'm mr. knight's army liaison officer. I have orders for you to release him into my custody. Well, that's just fine, lieutenant. Well, I've never heard of you, either. I'm sure you'll be hearing from my superior any minute. That's probably him now. Colonel hegal here. Colonel, this is general stratton. General stratton. Hegal...hegal! Quite the honor, sir. VOICE MODULATION I need you to release your prisoner Into lieutenant benedict's custody asap. But, sir, I don't think that i-- Don't think, soldier. do it, and it's done. Yes, sir. absolutely. You're free to go. Sir. Does this mean there are two thieves? The one who stole the missing serum And the guys who shot dr. matheson? No, it can't be a coincidence. You have to go back and download their inventory logs. Why can't kitt do it? Billy, the trunk line was severed. CONNECTION SEVERED I can't access their network. Then what good are you? I was able to record a voice print from the assault. RECOVERED VOCAL SIGNAL, UNKNOWN SUSPECT I got the serum, boys. let's go, let's go! Enough consonants and syllables were articulated To find a match, but not without access To the government's security databases. Yeah, we're working on it. Thanks again for busting me out. If you're so grateful, maybe you could spring For the cost of renting the uniform! It wasn't cheap! I had no idea how much my dad and torres did, And now I'm trying to do both their jobs. It's okay to sweat... As long as they don't see you sweat. You're doing better than you think. If we could just crack the government databases, It's our best shot for finding a voice match For dr. matheson's killer. Torres had the highest level clearance. Yeah, but the government erased his password. Only the one they knew about. How do you know his password? I have perfect pitch. Each click of the keys makes a distinct sound, And I memorized the pattern. I KILL THE KARAOKE. Can I help you? Uh, you must be dr. connelly. I'm lieutenant benedict. I work with michael knight. How's he doing? He's a little shaken up. Actually, he's pretty scared. I had to calm him down. I'm sorry about dr. matheson. I've started packing up my personal affects. I've already been let go. Why? The military owns his work now. I was always afraid this might happen. Why did he develop a serum with military applications? It was never intended that way. He wanted to help the disabled by stimulating nerve repair And cell rejuvenation. To compensate for loss of function In brain/body synergism? Exactly. I'm a big reader. He was trying to get approval To test hxp on patients, but the fda refused. - Let me get that. - oh. This must be hard on you. Well, I think that army guy Thinks I had something to do with it. He keeps pointing fingers. And I'm starting to think that maybe he's right. I mean, if I hadn't said anything, Maybe dr. matheson would still be alive. Michael, you have a call from sarah. Good news. Thanks to zoe, we now have access to the databases. Did you find a voiceprint match for dr. matheson's killer? His name is victor galt. ??? ASSASIN AND THIEF. And based on nsa chatter, CROSS REFERENCING LEADS It looks like the north koreans contracted him To steal the hxp formula. Don't we have a photo? No, nothing that can be verified. But according to fbi informants, He launders his money through a hotel and nightclub Called la soleil. Kitt, looks like we're going clubbing. I'll park it myself. No way, dude. those are expensive cars. It's my ass if they get scratched-- Hey! Don't go chasing any tailpipe. Michael, at the rate they're letting people in, You'll be in line approximately 62 hours. REVIEWING SUREVEILLANCE FOOTAGE CALCULATING EXIT TO ENTRANCE RATIO Ah, that's what the vip list is for, kitt. You just have to tell me my name. I'm on the list. Michael, tell the doorman you are nick folman. Nick folman. Nice place. Kitt, can you please do something about this music? Accessing dj booth. * I love the nightlife ** * I've got to boogie ** * on the disco 'round,* *oh, yeah * Kitt, the idea was to make the music better. I assumed this was a popular hit. Billy played it 389 times on my music system. Billy has issues. What else has he been up to? He mostly plays second life on my touch screen. Curiously, billy's avatar drives a car named kitt. And its mechanic is named mike. Okay, you tell billy you are not his tree house. * when you've got women* *all over town * * you can love them all,* *and when you're through... * Kitt, I think I know how we can find galt. How, michael? Can you dial the cell phones in the club? Of course. but why? Once you have their numbers, you can access their voicemails. Which will allow me to search For a voiceprint matching galt's. Exactly. Very good, michael. TRACING CELL PHONES According to my scanners, there are 320 signals In the general vicinity. Dialing now. Work fast, kitt. This could be our last chance to find galt Before he passes the serum off to the buyers. Excuse me. Are you nick folman? Yep, nick folman. that's me. Then let me show you to the vip lounge. Your bottle service is all set up. Lead the way. Oh, my god. I found a message from victor galt On alexandra pachinko's voicemail. It came from a scrambled proxy phone. Impossible to trace. But you might consider asking alexandra about it. Considering she is the svelte lady Who is causing your heart to race. Mike, my scanners are indicating-- I saw you at balham labs. Who do you work for? Not the north koreans. Isn't that who paid you? Let's try that again, shall we? Who do you work for? Man, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. Fine. I work for flag. Flag. I have to go meet the buyers. What about him? KILL HIM AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT. When he's drunk, then take his car And drive him off a cliff. - Bring his car around back. - you got it. Nice ride. Too bad we're gonna have to wreck it. Hey! what's going on? I've lost contact with michael. Tell me where he is. Screw you--ow! Wrong answer. What? Those appletinis are stronger than they look. - Jeez. ease up. - Oh, where you going? We barely got to know each other. Kitt, trunk. Let me go! Come here. aah! It's okay. I'm a flag. Michael, your blood alcohol level is far too high To allow you to take the wheel. Fine, I don't want to drive anyway. I want a burger. Take me to a drive-thru. Michael, you do know that it's an urban legend, That greasy food helps a hangover. Look, the government's not sponsoring us anymore, Zoe can't cook, and there's nothing in the fridge. I need a burger! Should we get something for the lady in the trunk? No, she's not hungry. Sliding doors, open. Thank you, sarah. I prefer a tidy interior. Michael got ketchup all over my steering wheel. I thought I told you to drink coffee. Had some. it didn't work. Who moved the gimbal? What an auspicious beginning for flag. Yeah, can we talk about that name? 'cause... No, we can't. Billy... Billy, I love what you did to this place. Yeah, the elevator's out. We needed a quicker way to get from floor to floor. Try not to puke on anything. Too late. I just got finished going over the logs I downloaded from balham labs. It looks like dr. matheson was the last one To sign out the samples reported missing by megan. Why would he steal his own serum? He could stand to make a lot more By selling it on the open market Than just giving it to the government. Hmm, maybe when I see megan tomorrow, I'll ask her if dr. matheson had been acting suspicious. Billy's got a date. - Michael, you're in no condition To tamper with my wipers. -What can I say? she gets me. You mean she gets lieutenant benedict. Yeah. Haven't exactly gotten around to telling her about that. What was that? That's the lady I stuffed in the trunk. She knows where galt is. You...coffee. You... Help me figure out how I can get information out of her. What do you think? put her in the gimbal? No, no. Nobody's spinning around inside of kitt. I'm not cleaning up vomit. If I'd been out clubbing and woke up in some guy's trunk... You know what would really freak me out? ??? what's going on? where am i? i ask the questions. who are you? your name is alexandra pachinko. yes or no? yes. where is victor galt? never heard of him. PLAYBACK alex, it's me, your little malush. how's business? okay, yes. i know victor. but...i don't know where he is. hello? wait, what-- what are you doing? malush, baby, it's me. VOICE DUPLICATION why did that guy come into my club? what's going on? victor, no! don't say anything! - it's not me. - YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON. you were supposed to kill him, and i'm hearing that he got away. he didn't get far, malush. we took care of him. but i'm worried about your deal-- don't worry, i'm on my way to meet them now. hey, i'll see you tonight. good job, kitt. play back. hello. (- alex, it's me. - malush, BABY, IT'S ME.) scrub forward a bit. MESSAGE PLAYBACK - there. play. (YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KILL HIM.) - what are you doing? ah, you had your turn. (AND I'M HEARING THAT HE GOT AWAY.) amplify the background noise, drop victor's voice. turn west on highway 110. 200 yards. i love gps. kitt, isolate the gps voice and piece together galt's destination. put her in holding until we figure out what to do with her. michael, according to my scanners, the case galt is carrying contains the stolen hxp serum. kitt, what did we say about the hangover voice? sorry, michael. are you sure you're up for this? don't worry about me. let's do this. you know what? i'm gonna need the other half of the money first. let's do it. take him out! come on! come on, come on, come on. there's nowhere to run, galt. just give me the serum. there's nowhere to run, galt. kitt, what's happening to him? there's a bio-metamorphic change occurring at a cellular level. that doesn't sound good. i would advise you to get inside immediately. galt's testosterone and adrenaline levels are spiking dramatically. kill you. yeah, it might not be a bad idea to give him some space while we see how this whole thing plans out. michael, look out. michael, galt's metamorphic changes are not slowing down. PAIN RECPTORS, NOCICPETOR it also appears his pain receptors have ceased to function. anything else you need to tell me, before i piss him off further? yes, michael. HE HAS FIVE TIMES THE STRENGTH OF A NORMAL HUMAN. michael, hurry! come out and fight! michael, you've been injured. i must return you to the ssc for medical treatment. no, i am ordering you to stay and fight. i have new programming that orders me to return you to the ssc for medical attentionin the event that you are seriously injured. whose idea was this new program? sarah's. hey, are you okay? what the hell do you think you're doing? - i-- - i'm in charge in the field. you don't put in protocols that override my authority. you're my responsibility now. this is because of what happened in hawaii, isn't it? what happened in hawaii has nothing to do with this. that guy almost killed you. you're more important than any one case. please, sarah, you have to trust that i know what i'm doing. and if you're gonna wear so many hats, you need to learn how to delegate. i'm doing the best i can. i'm sorry if it doesn't meet the standards you're used to. sarah, you're doing an amazing job. and your father would be very proud. now, we need to figure out how to beat this guy, 'cause i'm not running again. hey! what's with the roller skates? like you said, we've got to find a way to move around quickly. and it gets me through the creepy areas faster. so, today's your big date? that's right. you seem to be making progress, considering you've been lying to megan about who you are. i'm not lying. it's called bending the truth. and it's a natural part of dating. what're you working on? a metabolic panel of galt's blood. he left a sample trying to smash kitt's windshield. this serum seems to fortify muscular function, overriding the brain/body barrier that stops you from burning out your nervous system. could the serum enhance senses like vision and hearing? maybe. why? kitt noticed that galt reacted to the blast when the suv exploded. interesting. if galt is sensitive to sound, maybe we can stop him, using a close proximity sonic weapon. it should over stimulate galt's nervous system, causing a complete shutdown. any luck finding galt yet? i'm still running a satellite search, michael. but are you sure you want to confront him? he seemed to handle you quite easily. first of all, kitt, he did not "handle" me, i was hung over. there's a big difference between that... and getting beaten. are you upset because i brought you back to the ssc? frankly, yeah. i can't do this job if you and sarah are making secret plans behind my back. i'm sorry, michael. it was my protocol. well, how 'bout this for a protocol, kitt. from now on, we're up front with each other. no secret pacts, no lies, and no game-playing. deal, michael. all right... now, let's find galt and finish this. you look great. i never thought i'd go out with a guy in uniform. but it really does suit you. well, i'm more than just a uniform. i'm not suggesting that's the only reason i'm going out with you. but i do like it. templeton, i have a confession to make. the reason i reported the serum missing, is because i was afraid dr. matheson was using it on himself. why do you think that? i found this photo last week. it was taken before i started working at the lab. doesn't even look like the same guy. dr. matheson couldn't get fda approval, and he knew that without human testing, the military was gonna pull our funding. so he used himself as a human guinea pig. i think that's why he was so defensive when i reported them missing. but i was concerned after some of our animal testing started showing some serious side effects. like what? the endocrine system spinning out of control. a large enough dose could cause a subject to overload and slip into extreme aggression and violent behavior. would you excuse me for one second? i just have to make a quick phone call. i'll be right back. hey, billy. how's the big date? informative. how do you mean? it looks like dr. matheson was getting high on his own supply. that's why the hxp serum went missing in the first place. wait. if matheson took it, then why didn't he metamorphosize like galt? smaller doses over a longer period. no way it would've had the same drastic effect as galt's mega dose. billy? hey! the north koreans are probably pissed galt took their money and used the rest of the serum on himself. so he kidnaps megan assuming she can replicate the formula. after all, she knows more about it than anyone else. sonic cannon program is installed. so how does it work? it produces a subsonic vibration, that only galt should be able to hear. it's like a super dog whistle. when do we head out? we don't. i'm flying solo. galt grabbed megan on my watch, i'm going with. actually, it's mike's call. he's in charge of the field now. i'll bring her back, billy. so how do we find this bad boy? we called him once. but this time, it won't be alexandra's voice he hears. kitt, dial galt's scrambled number we got at la soleil. mike, what're you doing? making a deal. hello. hey, malush. what's going on? i was wondering when you were gonna call. you still running away from fights? thought you might be interested in a trade. megan connelly for the rest of the serum. she can make me new serum. you think so? research assistant? yeah, i'm sure the north koreans won't mind waiting six or seven months. on the other hand... i'm looking at three vials of the real deal. i thought the rest of it was stolen. it was. by me. what do you think i was doing at balham labs? trying to cover my tracks. why do you care about this girl? maybe i like her legs. i hear that. all right, you meet me at 23 wilmington way in hawthorne. one hour. and one other thing. bring alexandra. AND LOOKS LIKE ??? sarah, i'm at the location, but i don't see galt. kitt, if billy's theory is right, then galt should be running at least three degrees hotter than normal. michael, there are two heat sources coming from inside that van, and one is significantly hotter than the other. that's gotta be him. i don't want to take any chances, kitt. as soon as we make the exchange, hit galt with the sonic cannon. yes, michael. let's go see your boyfriend. hey, baby. mr. knight. have alexandra bring me the serum. give me megan first. now show me the stuff. how do i know it's real? stop! send her over with it. hey, baby. i'm glad you're here. i needed to test it. what did you do to me? i'm sorry, baby. what the hell's in it? those appletini's do have a kick. you'll be fine, all right. kitt, now! turn it off. why would you save a guy who just shoved a needle into your arm? he loves me. you know, they have therapy for that. turn it off! now! do it, kitt. thank you, baby. i do love you. what are you doing? TAKING BACK MY ADVANTAGE. zoe, do you have anything? i got satellite pov. that isn't good. you know what's worse? LOOKS LIKE BILLY IS THEIR ONLY HOPE. hey! come on, come on. MEGAN. you're gonna pay for that. you're nothing without your car. dude... okay. you look pretty good out of uniform, too. actually, it wasn't mine. it was rented. i'm not entirely who you think i am. and i know that sounds really weird, but i have a really good explanation if you just give me a chance. okay. really? i think i owe you the benefit of the doubt, templeton. actually, megan, there's one other thing. what? my friends call me billy. kitt, you okay? i'm fine, michael. are you okay? yeah, i'm fine, too. knowing you, i'm sure it's nothing a couple of pints of vitamins won't fix. yeah, you got that right. initiate designated driver mode. michael? i'm kidding. any faster, you'll set off the smoke alarms. here, come here. i want a witness. our first completed cases... F.L.A.G.(FOUNDATION FOR LAW AND GOVERNMENT) under the new flag. - aww. - oh, here, and look at this. i've been going through the foundation's archives, their cases were amazing. they believed one man could make a difference. shouldn't it be... "one man with a really tricked out car and an awesome team?" yeah. that's just what we got. together... we are going to make a difference. break it.
