Ha ha ha! Busted! Dude,Katie's not on your team. You said you picked Lisa. Me and Kitt versus you and Lisa. They decided to switch. Decided? She's a robot. Ooh,I wouldn't make her mad. So... what'll it be,Mr. Knight? Drench or dishonor? Kitt,roll down your windows. Mike! - Targeting.  - Traitor! Direct hit. Hey,hey! What the hell are you doing? Hello,Sarah. Hey,Sarah. You guys missed the R&D meeting. We were just blowing off some steam. By soaking kitt? - Yeah.  - Told you he should be waterproof. He is waterproof, As long as you don't roll down his windows. So from now on,he won't. Especially on this next one. A week ago,a U.S. undercover agent Went to meet with what we believe Is a terrorist cell in Baja. The operations code name was Iguana. Agent Turner's cover was as an import facilitator. He's a high end trafficker Who specializes in getting illegal cargo into the U.S. We think he was being asked to help bring in A weapons system. What kind of weapons system? We don't know. What kind of terrorist cell? We don't know that either. Day after turner reached baja, He vanished. 12 hours later, An extraction team was sent in after him. They vanished too. That's not creepy. Turner has a homing device on him. It's an active rfid transmitter Inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of his wrist. It has a range of 400 yards, Transmit duration 216 hours. Then the signal's deteriorating. Can kitt's frequency amp help? That's what we're hoping. The meeting with Turner in the cell was set here In Todos Santos. A surf spot? An international surf spot. Which leads us to believe the cell Turner was contacting Was either in the surf culture,or they're posing as surfers. Great. One thing... I don't do water. Well,you don't seem to have a problem with it. I'm just better on dry land. Is this because of Lily Mulraney? No,it's not because of Lily Mulraney. Who's Lily Mulraney? - Grade school bully that swirlied Mikey.  - It's not Lily Mulraney. And she did not swirly me. I didn't realize how much it affected you. Look,all we need to do is get Carrie to come with me, And I'll be fine... she knows how to surf. No can do. Agent rivai's in D.C. Well,if this is where I'm goin', It'd be helpful to have someone that knows how to surf. Whoa! Sick swells! That dude barreled 20 yards before he pearled. Zoe,you surf? Doesn't everyone? She's coming with me. Sweet! Where? Can I have a word? Don't you think sending Zoe on an undercover mission Might be a little risky? Sometimes she can be... Out there? Well,she speaks spanish,and she surfs. Do you? No,and...no. But that's not the point. Zoe is... Zoe. How 'bout you,billy? Do you surf? No. No. Th-the ocean's... Not really my thing. I I rash up. I want Mike and Zoe geared up for the beach in 40. Cover is...devon and bonnie. A honeymooning couple. Awesome! I have lost my coworker. She's a little crazy." The closer you get,the stronger the signal,okay? How much to post bail? There are four modifications. Function one is sand. Function two is wet sand. Guys... It's a mission. It won't be any different than the others. Right. Let's do it,surfer. Not too different. Chamber doors opening. Lock intra-strength system active. Orale. Party wave! Monster slash! You really know how to do all that? My fakies could use some work, But my laybacks are solid. How bout your hang tens? Please tell me you're not gonna talk like that. Michael,we have arrived in Todos Santos. The hotel el surfer is 1/4 mile ahead And is the last place From which agent Turner made contact. El surfer? Only the best for my girl. What more could I want for my honeymoon? You...know we're not officially undercover yet. I'm getting into character. - Mike  - Ah! Are we interrupting something? Oh,hey,guys,what's,uh...cracking? What's your status? Status is good. We're approaching the hotel. Once you arrive, I want you to check in, And let Kitt focus everything he has on that beacon. Our plan exactly. Except I¡¯m getting us some fish tacos And margaritas first. Excellent idea. Keep us posted. Fish tacos and margaritas? How is that an excellent idea? Their cover needs to be convincing. Of course,but... Rather than worrying about the abilities of our field ops, You should be digging Into agent Turner's background. He's squeaky clean. Nothing's unusual in his files. Then what's not in his files? Until we know what's going on with Turner and this cell, Our people are vulnerable. I don't want them surprised. Wow. What a great room. With... One bed. Si no te gusta,vete a otro lugare. No te ahueves. It's our honeymoon. One bed's all we need. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm trying to keep it real. Sure. Uh,thing is,I kinda made it a rule Not to do anything like that With anyone from work. - You do it with Sarah.  - No,I don't. I mean,we did,but that's different. She and I are... Don't worry,I promise nothing's gonna happen That's not completely professional. Okay. As long as I don't have tequila. Michael. Yes,Kitt? I have picked up agent Turner's homing beacon. Zoe. Present. Really? It's called blending in. Kitt,what's the status? According to the homing beacon, Turner is one of the two men in the beach cruiser, 25 yards to your 2:00. You can't tell it's him for sure? The beacon is transmitting from the vehicle, But as I do not have a visual on either man, I cannot confirm the identity. Let's follow him. Burn rubber,Kitt! Burning rubber. Just stay on the beacon,Kitt. Beacon tracking system locked. I have picked up a stronger signal. Stronger as in the beacon's gotten closer? The tracking system has been replaced By a targeting device. Kitt,get us out of here. Mike. Kitt! Pressure equalization on. Go for resurfacing. This is cooler than the nemo ride at Disneyland. It would be cooler - If you didn't almost destroy the car.  - We didn't do anything. Kitt tried to dodge that missile and couldn't. It blew him into the frickin' ocean. We know,Mike. Kitt got a profile of the attack, And we're looking into it,but whatever it was that hit you, It's more advanced than anything in use today. Well,if this is what they're trying to get into the U.S. We got a bigger problem than we thought. The real question is How did Turner and these guys get their hands on it? What makes you think it's Turner? We never got a visual on him. Mike,agent Turner has an offshore bank account. Yeah,we hacked the bank record. Just last month,he withdrew almost everything in there. It's over $2 million. So you think he's flipped to the other side. Anything's possible. Just got word... Two bodies washed up ten miles south of here... The extraction team. Great. So now we have no tracking device And no more contacts. What do we do? You hit the streets. We drew them out once. Maybe we can do it again. Okay. But first we probably need to dry off. Prepare to surface in three,two,one. Michael,I am confused. The answer is because it would be a mistake. What would? Sleeping with Zoe. But she invited you in. Do you not find her attractive? Yeah. That's the problem. Does this have to do with your relationship with Sarah? Why does everyone keep asking me that? We're not in a relationship. Now you sound agitated. - I'm not agitated.  - Are you sure? Yes! Good night,Michael. Good night,Kitt. Kitt,any luck with the scanners? Negative,Michael. Though this beach has vehicles Similar to the one we pursued last night, I still have no conclusive matches For agent Turner or any of the men who attacked us. Well,it's been four hours. One more,and we need to hit another beach. # You don't know the game like I want you to # # Wanna show you how to do it # # Before we're through # # Get your freak on # # It's the thing to do # # I said freak on # Hola,chicas. Estoy buscando este tipo. Ele has visto? Lo siento. Gracias. Voice scan negative. The subjects are telling the truth. Hey,you're on our beach. Look for someone Well,he ain't here. Maybe look at the picture to be sure. Nope. Get off my beach. You all right? Name's Skyler. Devon. Do you know who those guys were? Beach hoppers. Well,I owe you. Let me buy you a beer. Uh... Well,if... you insist. Sorry,bro. Never seen him. But you look familiar. Military? Army. Two tours myself before I had enough and cashed it in. Any reason? I found this. See,I realized I was living In the land of the free without actually being free. Here... it's a whole different story. What's the catch? No catch. All you gotta do is an odd job here and there, And the rest of it is paradise. If... You're willing to go for it. I am. Ever since we got here, I've been telling Devon we should stay. Well,you got the right idea. Still... I have to convince him. Can anyone say... tequila? Tequila. Ohh! Right. That's it for me. Thanks for the drinks. Thanks for your help. Think about what I told ya. I will. Don't worry,I'll have him agreeing to move by morning. You guys really wanna see what I'm talking about, You should come by el pescadero tomorrow. El pescadero? It's a local surf spot about five miles south. That's where the waves are. We don't normally bring in outsiders, But you two might be all right. Good night. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I can't sleep with you,Zoe. That's not what I was thinking. Oh. I was thinking how this guy just happened to show up Right when you were getting jumped. Yeah. And that's why we're gonna check his fingerprints. Accessing afis. Skyler Rand,explosives expert. Purple heart,bronze star. Dishonorable discharge. I knew he was bad. Makes him even hotter. According to the records, Sergeant Rand was discharged for insubordination. Coulda been me. Perhaps,Michael,though in Skyler Rand's case, His entire squad Was dishonorably discharged with him. How many guys in his squad? Four surviving members at the time of the discharge, Including Sergeant Rand. Same number as the guys who jumped us last night. Counting Skyler... Same number as the guys on the beach today. Kitt,can you get files on the rest of Rand's team? Cross-reference them with anything you have From last night or today. Match is over 85%. Dude... we rock. You're better at this spy stuff than I expected. Yeah? You too. Now are you thinking what I'm thinking? I told you not to let me have tequila. Un momento,por favor. Mike,we figured out how to track Turner. He was given a radio ear implant on one of his old jobs. All we have to do is load this into Kitt And set it to track him. Last night was epic. How many times do I have to say it? Nothing happened. How many times do I have to say it? I don't care. Your relationships are none of my business. I'm not having a relationship. Nothing happened. At least nothing I remember. I think it was surprising,is all. Please. I'm the naked one. I got that. They'll get over it. Anyway,how cool is it That we get to be out in the field? Actually,I think I like it better in the kittcave. Why? Out here there are too many variables. You never know what's gonna happen. Billy... that's what makes it so fun. What it is is you're jealous Zoe got to work this mission instead of you. Please. I was working last night. Unlike some people. I was working this mission last night. That... is not what I meant. Billy and I came up with a new application That will let kitt track down Turner. Zoe and I i.d.'d a group of mercenaries as our terror cell. - Really?  - Yeah. - Were they with Turner?  - No. But I know how we can find out if Turner's with them. El pescadero beach. Here we are. Any hits,Kitt? I have no readings for agent Turner. However,I believe Skyler Rand is southeast of you. Got him. Let's go. So... what do we do now? Relax and see what we can see. Relax. I can be relaxed. Ooh. You all right? Clearly,I like four walls around me. This whole nature thing... freaks me out. I think I'm getting hives. Sweet beach. Glad you guys found it. Outstanding bodysurf to the south too... if you don't mind the rocks. I'm there! Great. You don't mind if I take Devon out with my boys? Yeah. Sure. Cool. I thought you had a thing about water. I really don't have a choice. Just remember,make your pop-ups fast, duck dives smooth,and avoid the rips,pearls, and any part of the north beach, because those waves are monster. Do you have any idea what I just said? No. But how bad could it be? Thought you might wanna try the north beach. North beach,huh? Lead the way. All right. Sure you don't wanna come out,Billy? Naw. Guess I must have the same thing Mike has about water. Water sand... and sunlight. None of that bothers you? Not really. How come? In the SSC, you're geek central like me. But out here you're... so cool. First... I try not to overthink things. And then I trust that my training will get me through. And that works? As long as you go with the flow,you know? - Sarah...  - Yeah,Kitt. I have just picked up a signal on your tracking application. Turner? I believe he is less than 100 yards southeast - of our current position.  - Let's check it out. Once we get out past the second reef, that's where the big waves are. Looks like we missed your boys. That's all right. Give you and me a chance to talk about what you're really doing down here. Thinking about what you were talking about. Going for it. What about your brother? Ah,he'll turn up somewhere. He's a wandering soul like you. What about you,Devon? You a wandering soul? I did some things in Iraq I'm not proud of. Now I'm just looking for a fresh start. I hear you. Seems to me you gotta look at life like surfing the wave. Some are big,some are small. But in order to ride any of them, you gotta be willing to let the wave take you. What if it takes you somewhere you shouldn't go? Shouldn't is a word that isn't in my vocabulary. Like if someone were to offer me and my boys a boatload of cash to do a job like the ones we used to do... Why should I say no? Depends on how dangerous the job. Don't wanna do anything stupid. Stupid is not listening to your gut. Sometimes even I make that mistake. Well,at least there's always another wave. True. But out here... That's what'll kill you. Here's our set. Dude. Kitt,can you hear me? Yes,Michael. How do you get up on a surfboard? You stand up on it. I hate you,lily merry. That's the dude Mike went surfing with. Why is he meeting up with Turner? Hey. Are you all right? Yep. I will be... just as soon as I kick that guy's ass. - Mike.  - Sarah. We thought you were with Skyler. I was,until he tried to kill me with a wave. Why? Billy and I just saw him go into a motor home. We think he's with Turner. We're on our way. Infrared x-ray and penetrating radar are now fully active. Cool. Give us audio too. Accessing parabolic microphones. So... we're good? Trust me... they'll be across the border tomorrow. They'd better,for you and your wife's sake. They have his wife? Mrs. Turner has not used her cell phone or credit card in the last two weeks. Will you help me with this? What are those? Kitt,we're losing picture. I'm sorry,Sarah,but it seems sergeant Rand has activated some sort of jamming device. We need to see what's in there. Perhaps you could get out and look through a window. I'll go. Sarah,the height on the lowest window on this motor home is 6 feet. I am afraid that you are not tall enough to look through the window. But Billy is. Help you,buddy? Yeah,I'm... looking for a bathroom. Bad chalupa. Spicy? Mm-hmm. Never gonna make it. What'd you see? Three cases for a next generation smart missile. You could tell all that from the cases? Yeah. I worked on the prototype. They're night industries'. This is bad. The weapons these guys have are our weapons? That's not possible. I saw it,Dr. Graiman. Three k-17 cobra cases,plain as day. What's a k-17 cobra? It's a next generation smart missile That uses stealth technology, And it can modify its attack profile based on the target. I thought that didn't exist yet. The missile should have recognized kitt as friendly. The chips in them are designed to know what they're targeting To prevent collateral damage. Not if they've been modified. Last month's shipment to the d.o.d. Was delivered as designed. Well,then somebody took them and altered the logic boards. Skyler Rand. His guys are explosive experts. They must have stolen the cobras and changed them. - But why?  - Money. He basically admitted to me That he and his buddies are mercenaries. But who's he working for? What does d.o.d. Think? D.o.d. Denies losing any ordnance at all. Come home. Skyler's motor home is off the map. But they're making their move tomorrow. With that jamming device,we won't be able to track 'em Until the missiles are out in the open. Then we'd better be ready to move fast. All I'm saying is Maybe I could get used to this sort of thing. Field work? Yeah. You and Mike get to deal with killer surfers. I had to infiltrate and exfiltrate the motor home. Exfiltrate? Yeah. It's a word we use in field work. We're on. Agent Turner just used a security override To bypass customs. Sandiego,two minutes ago. Billy,get the crossing on the screens And find that motor home! You're en route in attack mode. Now. Chamber doors opening. Launch prep complete. Kitt,attack mode. Initiating transformation. Transformation complete. Kitt,hang on. Why are we stopping? - I'm coming with you.  - Me too. Michael,as you know,in attack mode I can accommodate only two passengers. My mission. It's my car. Close it up. Occupant restraint system active. Ow! Yeah. Should be fun. - Get off me.  - You get off me! - You're heavy.  - I am not heavy. Inner doors opening. # I need some action # # Yeah # # I need some action # # Oh,I need some action # # Yeah # Motor home's stopped. - Where?  - There. Billy,get mike. Mike,they're going for the coronado mesa nuclear plant. You know what'll happen If one of those missiles hits that thing? Given the k-17's configuration, I expect an amplified detonation Followed by a radiation plume That could surpass the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. Oh... Yeah,you know,all you had to say is it'll be bad. - Michael.  - Yeah,kitt. It will be very bad. Sweet. Time to make some money,honey. Thar she blows. We're two minutes out. How does it look? Not good. What about Turner and his wife... are they in danger? Just the opposite. Looks like they've been a part of Skyler's gang all along. Mike,remember,you can't attack directly with kitt. Even in attack mode,he can't handle four cobras. They have four of those things? That we can see! Glad you guys came along? Skyler. Light 'em up! Aw. Run away,little piggy. All the way home. You shoulda stayed in the water. It seems as though our decoy ploy has worked. So let's back him up. Put it down! Not too late,bro. You let me do this,we split 12 million bucks. Who's paying ya? Does it matter? What do you think? Lower the weapon. I thought it was you... - Lieutenant.  - Drop it. Afghanistan. You had a different hottie for a partner. Yeah. But still the same holier-than-thou attitude. Guys like you Always forget one thing about freedom. Drop it now! It costs. Missile flying. Impact in 16,15... The cobra. Kitt,hit the emp. It won't work on rocket fuel.  Launch missiles! No,they'll never catch up. 8...7... Impact in 5... The amplifier! Using my amplifier To jam the missile's gyro chip Will completely reverse the k-17's direction. 3...2... It's either that or chernobyl. Scrambler amplification activating now. 1... Missile redirected. Amplification successful. Missile reversed. Wait. It's heading back to Mike. Skyler,we gotta get outta here. Come on! Come on. Live free,bro. What are you doing? Mike! Mike. Mike! I'm okay. Just got word from DHS. Skyler rand's team and the Turners Are on full lockdown in a federal detention facility. Looks like they'll be hanging 10... To 20! Anybody wanna celebrate? Sorry,we have a meeting with the defense department. It seems now they're interested in discussing Some misplaced cobras. I got work. And I've got a date. Rematch with the soakers? Load 'em up. Yes! I got katie.
