Both. I'm afraid I don't understand the dynamics Of the male-female relationship. And you probably never will, kitt. Come on, he wants to learn. We should teach him. See, this so-called sparring session is how they say Let's play a little "how's your father?" Without actually Having to say it. Why not simply ask for sex? 'cause it reeks of desperation. He should know. I did detect a rise in hormone levels When mike and sarah started hitting one another. Now you're starting to get it. Not bad. Maybe if you put a little more oomph into it. Like that? Is this another example of an indirect request For intimacy? She's straddling him. I'd say that's pretty direct. Mr. Torres is approaching. Kitt, screen off! Mike! Briefing in ten minutes. You're going out. I need a shower. Me too. Me too. Me too. Billy, your hormone levels elevated with zoe's When you hit on top of each other. Does that mean that you also want to play "how's your father?" No. This is all very perplexing. Can I borrow your shampoo? Look at my sexy man. Here we go. I see answers. Oh, boy. Now that's shock and awe, people. You have everything on screen? Everything as of three minutes ago. This is their last live screen. I smell foreplay. Freshly showered foreplay. What are we looking at? Bonnie and clyde. You'll like these two, mike. They hacked into the treasury and transferred All senatorial and congressional salaries To iraqi war widows through untraceable wire transfers. Not bad. Oh, they're good. Real good. They're anarchists. And they're getting more brazen by the day. They started with soft targets And they're working their way up. Their website states that their primary objective Is to take down the military industrial complex Of the united states. Of which we are a part. If their online following keeps growing At its present rate, They might actually be able to do it. These guys are becoming a pop phenomenon. Top hit on all search engines. What do they call themselves? Nikki and max for a free america. You aren't serious. Unfortunately, I am. Wow, they're hot. I think sarah should come with me on this one. I bet you do. Yeah, I should go with mike. I don't think that's a good idea. Dad, I think a female perspective Will be a valuable asset On this one. She's absolutely right. Kitt, have you figured out where they'll hit next? I have factored in all known variables, Including, but not limited to online chatter, Websites, blogs. And? And I have deducted the probable location Of their next target. The town of hastings. You're guessing, kitt? Deduction, logic, and probability are not guessing. A guess is a prediction about the outcome Made without factual evidence or support. I do not guess, mike. Chamber door is open ???????????? Chamber door is closing Why didn't you tell him who nikki is? 'cause they don't need to know. And the fbi doesn't want it public. Mark my words. This is gonna blow up in our faces. So? So. So we're alone. Let's talk. Come on. It's not like we're ever really...Alone. What, kitt? He's cool. Actually, my core temperature Is running a bit high Due to the incline and low altitude. What about billy... Zoe, torres? Your dad? 'cause nobody has anything better to do Than spy on michael knight all day. I have nothing better to do. Me neither. Got all the time in the world. We're on a mission. I like to keep personal stuff And work stuff separate, that's all. So why did you want me to come? What, you didn't wanna come? No, you said, "sarah should come with me on this one." 'cause I thought you wanted to come. What about the whole female perspective thing? What about the whole rec room, shower thing? I just thought... What? Oh, I get it. You're gonna play it like that. Like what? I don't know. Hey, guys. There's lots of chatter on the web About nikki and max's next target, And the number 15 keeps coming up. 15? An address, a date, a...Highway? Kitt, analyze the number 15 and hastings With respect to the previous targets Of nikki and max. I can provide no meaningfully relevant Results using hastings and the number 15. I'll stay on it. You guys okay? We're fine. Yeah, we're okay. Why? Just checking. No big. Outtie. How long do you think? I say he goes first. I say you're misreading the whole dynamic. He's all coiled up and hinky. Hinky? Mike is loose as a goose. A man with a plan. A dude in a mellow mood. You rhyme like a white boy and not a beastie boy. Ten bucks he breaks before she does. Make it a double sawbuck. You're on. 15. That could be anything. There's gotta be some kind of pattern to it. What? Nothing. He folded like a cheap lawn chair. No way! It's completely innocent conversation. He's practically drooling. Him? Sarah can barely keep her hands off my boy. Are we watching the same movie? We're doing this all for you. That's right. You can count on us. Take charge. Take charge! We are your answers. These crazy kids. Sure, just two misguided teens in a hot car Blowing things up. Well, the hazardous waste facility That they destroyed was named in a class-action suit. So you think they're doing the public a service? No, come on. Country was born in violence and dissent. It's always been with us. Well, I appreciate the homage to the founding fathers, But anarchy is not the answer, charles. Yeah, well, one man's anarchist, Another man's robin hood. They're dangerous and reckless. Period. Depends on your point of view. I don't see how you can look at it any other way. Well, maybe to the untrained eye We're the ones riding around in a hot car blowing things up. All right, this is max... And nikki... We shall see you guys next time. We love you. Ow, peace! They're entering hastings. I synchro'd the traffic signals on approach with kitt's speed. It should save them a couple of minutes. Awesomeness. How did you hack the grid? I repurposed that software firewall you invented And slipped it in as a trojan horse To the traffic control computer in hastings. Great minds, right? I'm uploading a list of motels to kitt. Look, this one has a vibrating bed. Hope they brought quarters. They should just get it over with, right? Absolutely. Clears the head. When I was playing planetary war craft last night, I imagined you were queen zorda of gorn. Queen zorda? The naked chick with the tentacles? I, uh... Did you just go all clarence thomas on me? No, the traffic cam And the software firewall, I thought we were having a moment. I could so call human resources right now. I'm--i'm sorry. It was a-- it was a misunderstanding. I'm going to ask you a question. Think very carefully before you answer. Okay. What was I doing with my tentacles? If this is our future, I'm really worried. 15 kilometers, 15 miles, 15 what? Maybe it's their 15th mission. No, it's their 10th mission. If you call terrorism a mission. Look. Military time. 1500 hours. 3:00. It's a quarter to three now. We only have 15 minutes to find the location. There is no empirical evidence To support your supposition, michael. It's a hunch, kitt. If I'm wrong, at 3:01, I'll apologize. Kitt, display all possible targets again. There are three military installations Within a 30-mile radius. Too obvious, and too highly fortified. There are no munitions plants, No manufacturers of guidance systems, And no ordnance suppliers. There's a cop checking us out. He is eying you suspiciously. Roll with it. Pay up. Smells like victory. Pff...Buy yourself something nice. I will. Sarah, michael, you may unlock your lips now. The officer is leaving. Okay. We're good. Yeah, good. When I was in iraq, sometimes we'd lose a huge truck Over a tiny little fuel pump relay. So? So maybe there's a company here That produces something small, That could affect something big. Kitt, research. Light manufacturing only. Part suppliers for vital industries, Military, energy. Anderson valve, manufacturers of check valves Used in every major oil refinery in the united states. Destruction of anderson's valve making capacity Will destruct the supply chain And increase the price of gasoline. How much? I estimate approximately $10 per gallon. Where is it? 3.2 miles from our current location. Anderson valve, let's go. That's their car... 1970 super bee, 426 hemi, four barrel, four speed. What a beaut. Only 21 were produced with the hemispherical head engine, And four-speed transmission. You boys done? Mm. Mm-mm. Kitt, weapons. Each carries a 15 round magazine, And i.D. Badges, compliments of dr. Graiman. The cameras on your identity badges Are linked real time With the nsa's facial recognition database. So we should be able to help you find nikki and max. Be careful. Thanks, dad. Kitt, open sesame. How the hell are we supposed to find these guys? Process of elimination. We'll alert you when facial recog Finds someone who doesn't belong. How much time? Just under two minutes. Kitt, scan for valve making equipment. Seven different valves are produced in the building. One minute remaining. Copy. Kitt, you said "check valve" earlier. Yes, sarah. Scan only for one-way valves. The only equipment capable of producing a one-way valve Is 30 yards to your one o'clock. Should thin the herd a bit. Billy, my sensors have detected the presence of c-4. Kitt sniffers detected c-4! All right. Sarah, there are explosives in that room. Hi,hold on right there Oh, boy. Mike, get out of there. It's too late, I'm going to try to disarm it. Michael, throw the bag into the alley. There's enough c-4 to take out half the building. Michael, you cannot disarm it in time. I have a plan. Kitt. Kitt! I am fine, michael. You may want to assist sarah. Nikki and max are getting away. Freeze! Drop it. You drop yours. Move it another inch, and you won't have any fingers left. It's her. Sarah, can you hear me? Yeah, carrie, I got 'em. Do not shoot. Sarah, fire if you have to. Negative, Do not fire. Nikki's congressman childress' daughter. Bet they told you not to shoot me, didn't they? They're idiots. Sarah! Mike! You should've shot her. Sorry. You were always bad at operation when we were kids. Just good at playing doctor. Incoming call. Put it up, exterior mode. Mike, are you okay? Why weren't we told who she was? The information was considered "need to know." Mmm, when it results in sarah pulling buckshot from my arm, I'd call it "need to know." The congressman asked us to keep this quiet. We felt obliged to honor his request. Mm, I can't believe you sent me after some spoiled brat Running around with a dude and a shotgun. What's her problem? Daddy didn't buy her a pony when she was a little girl? Actually, I bought her two. Max has her brainwashed. Congressman. Max teach her how to shoot, too? Mike, please. You must be michael knight. Nice to finally meet you. I'm afraid I'm to blame for my daughter's aim. She's bagged her fair share of deer over the years. Good thing I don't have antlers. Nicole is a sweet girl. I may have overindulged her, And her mother leaving wasn't easy, But this is not her. Yeah, she seems like a real angel. That's my daughter sarah. She's a sweet girl too. Most of the time. The girl was always strong-willed, But this is something else. She went to berkeley to get an education. Four years later, I barely recognized the girl I moved into the dormitory. And you think max was responsible? He's a cancer. He took my only child from me. The situation seems to be similar To that of patty hearst. Creating a condition-- we know what stockholm syndrome is, kitt. Mike will find her. And bring her back safely. I don't want my daughter hurt, mr. Knight. I'd consider it a personal favor. I'll take care of it. Thank you, michael. Charmer, isn't he? He's a politician, charming is his business. He's also been very supportive Of my father's experiments for years. You mean he's knight industries' congressional sugar daddy. You buy it, the patty hearst thing? Not one bit. She shot me with a smile on her face. Thanks. You're welcome. Where would you go if you were them? An island in the south pacific. Nice. I have an alternate hypothesis. Of course you do. Surveillance footage captured from anderson valve Included this. I'm not sure what I'm looking at, But it's definitely Not an island in the south pacific. I apologize. Allow me to zoom. And focus on the paper in his pocket. Tee ticks? Kitt, search for words or phrases Containing those letters in that order. I've done that. There are more than three million possibilities. But there is also an image in the corner of the document. Can you tell what it is? It's too obscured for my recognition software. But it's quite possible the shape is a corporate logo. So now cross-check those letters with the names of corporations. Which narrows the list Down to 78 worldwide. Now sort only for the u.S. It leaves six possibilities, And only one of those has a military connection. Teeter plastics. For many years, they were a small family-run operation. But their business expanded rapidly Due to military contracts. What do they make? Turbofan engines used on tomahawk missiles. Where's their main base of operations? It is a factory complex 134 miles from here. That's their next target. Maybe we were wrong. No, they'll show up eventually. Could be a couple hours. Any suggestions on how we could kill some time? I have access to any number of games, Puzzles, movies, trivia. He wasn't talking to you, kitt. Spin the bottle. What are you, 12? Okay, seven minutes in heaven. It's a stakeout, dorkus. Sarah's completely focused. It's a rule. Two people can't sit in a car at night And not make out. Aww, little zoe. So naive. A significant heat source is approaching The front side of the complex. Let's go. Kitt, do you still have them? Yes, they are currently attempting To breach the facility's main gate. I'm going in. Continue on your present path. If you come back during the day, It might be a little easier to get in. Hi there. Remember me? How's the arm? Get your hands up. Both of you. Max! Shut up! Back off! Now. Come on, max. We both know you're not gonna hurt her. You don't know anything about me. What are you doing? Shut your mouth! I am sick of hearing you whine. What? You take another step, I'll kill her. Please, help me! Max, for future reference You may not want to grab the girl who shot me And use her as a human shield. Drop your weapons, Or, once again, I'll kill her. Mike, he's serious. Mike. All right. Michael, max is getting away. Forget him. We got what we came for. Daddy, max made me do everything. He told me that he was gonna kill you If I didn't help him. Oh, sweetheart. I'm glad you're all right. How'd she get away? I don't think she got away. I think she's buying time for her boyfriend. She knew daddy would bail her out. Not this time. There's a federal warrant out for her arrest. How did you guys hack into The treasury department's mainframe? Max did everything. What is this place? Come on, nicole. We're going home. Actually, congressman, she's going To a federal detention facility. They do the best tattoos. That's absurd. She was clearly being held against her will. Alex. I'm sorry. There's a federal warrant. Don't say a word to anybody. I'll call my lawyers and have them meet us. Not a word. Daddy? Is that really necessary? Not necessary, but it's the law. Wait. I need to talk to my dad. Can I just talk to him for one minute, please? I want to talk to mom too. Can you get her on the phone? Sure, sweetheart. Do they really have to listen to this? Take your time. 20 bucks says nikki rolls over on max. No way. She loves him. Plus, he's way hot. Hot? Are we watching the same movie? Double or nothing. You're on. My daughter's agreed to testify against max, Provide the names of everyone in his organization. Thank you. And I'm sure the fbi will appreciate her cooperation. Well, then take off her cuffs. I'm sorry. It's okay, daddy. I'm ready. Take me in. I'll go with her. Hey. Did you see the look on nikki's face When carrie put the cuffs on her? It was like her eyes almost popped out of her head. It doesn't matter. What do you mean? I mean limited intel Tying our hands. Come on, We were set up for failure. Max gets away and she gets off? What's it all for? We brought back the congressman's daughter. Mission accomplished. Yeah, but max is still out there. And I don't like leaving loose ends. I think we did the best we could given our parameters. Look, we're not the first To get sidelined by politics. And we're not gonna be the last. Sarah, you're a scientist. What do you know about politics? How do you think I got the funding For my research all these years? Look, what's done is done. Game room. Eight ball. I'm up five games to four. Your memory's as bad as your aim. I'm up five-four. Please, I would beat you one-handed. Agent rivai, You thought about your future? On a daily basis, congressman. I can make sure that future Becomes brighter than you ever imagined. Not gonna happen. Well, she's my daughter. Had to give it a shot. Dr. Graiman, have you made any modifications To the computer system? No. Why? One of the firewalls is down. That's impossible. The system was accessed from the game room. What's going on? There's no way she could have logged on from here. The system's locked. It's still locked, but it's been breached. Has anything been downloaded? She took it. Who? Took what? Nikki. She took it all. What exactly did she get? Four tiny little files, except it's who we are, What we do, our secret location, And our ties to the government. If that gets on the internet... She downloaded everything? How? I don't know, but she did. Alert carrie. Mike, find her. Fast. I've plotted an intercept course for agent rivai. We will need maximum speed to reach them Kitt, attack mode. Initiating transformation Transformation complete Daddy? Yeah. What's gonna happen to me? Don't worry. They'll take care of everything. Rivai Nikki stole our files. What? She downloaded five classified files From the ssc computer. She has everything on us. She must've had some sort Of wireless scanner. You need to search her. Kitt's tracking the van's gps. Tell carrie I'm on my way. We're getting a ton of chatter on the web. Max is telling everyone that they have something big. Mike, you have to stop them Before our files end up on the internet. We have reason to believe That your daughter stole classified information. What information? Carrie says she doesn't have anything on her. Is there any other way she could've Transmitted the information out of the ssc? Even if she pulled the files using a wireless trawler, She'd have to dump them to a drive. The congressman's cell phone! Carrie, she downloaded The files to the congressman's cell phone. Congressman, do you have your cell? Of course. May I see it? Sorry, dad. Carrie. Carrie, can you hear me? Something happened. Billy, Play back the last ten seconds of that phone call. Congressman, do you have your cell? Of course. May I see it? That did not sound good. I'll take that, daddy. Hey, babby Are we ready to roll? She's going with us. Mike, We lost contact with carrie. There was some sort of crash. There was. Kitt, normal mode. Initiating trasformation Transformation complete Max tracked the congressman's cell phone. Everybody stay back! Nikki's gone. And I think they took carrie hostage. Kitt, call an ambulance. The congressman's down. They had another car waiting. We can trace them via the congressman's phone. No, we can't. She pulled out the battery. Any sign of carrie? Kitt, you picking up anything? There are no discernable traces Of agent rivai in the immediate vicinity. What about these tracks? I want infrared. I have analyzed the vehicles on site. The treads do not match any of their tires. Kitt's right, they don't match the emergency vehicles Or police cars on the scene. It's possible the tracks are from the getaway car. The tread is from a goodyear assurance comfort tread. It's one of the most popular brands of tires Sold and distributed in north america. Of course it is. Great. That narrows it down. We got something here. Looks like an oil leak. That's correct, michael. Is that leak from the getaway car? Based on its viscosity, and level of oxidation, There is a 93% chance it is. Kitt, analyze the roads within 100-mile radius And search for a car with a fluid leak At the same rate per distance. There are exactly 47 vehicles within those parameters. Probability is high That one of them Is the vehicle max is driving. They should be within striking distance of nikki and max. Still narrowing. There are 23 vehicles On that stretch of highway that could be a match For the car nikki and max are driving. Got anything, kitt? I do not detect our primary targets, nor agent rivai. How many of the cars have cell phones? The signals are from 20 cars. Check the remaining three. That's right, she dumped the battery. Kitt, I need to see inside those cars. Accessing satellite imagery. Putting it on-screen now. Got it. Any sign of rivai? Kitt, give me heat signatures. Heat signatures on-screen. She's not moving. Kitt, is she alive? Come on, carrie. Move. We got movement! Mike, go! With pleasure. Ow! That's what I'm talking about! We can download now. Houston, we have a problem. What is it? She turned on her father's cell. She must have another battery. It's uploading our files to the internet. Billy, run the sweeper program. Not working. Mike, I can't stop the transfer. Kitt, deploy e.M.P. It'll stop the car and fry the cell phone. Michael, at their current speed, There is a nearly 100% probability That the electromagnetic pulse Will cause the vehicle to flip. What if we take out a tire? It will cause an uncontrollable spin Resulting in a cataclysmic crash. Okay, bad idea. What if we take out both rears at the same time? Causing both rear tires To deflate simultaneously should result In the least dangerous outcome. Unfortunately, I cannot fire Two spikes simultaneously. Kitt, take the wheel. You take the right, I'll take the left. On my mark. If we do not fire at exactly the same moment-- I know, kitt. Three. Two. One. Fire! Their upload's almost complete. Carrie's safety is your first concern, mike. Once they complete the transfer, They won't need her anymore. Come on. Get up. You have no idea what you're doing. I could say the same thing about you. Who's your buyer? China? North korea? I'm not selling them. This isn't about some tech war. It's about telling the truth. To who? The american people. We just uploaded the files to the internet To expose the lies and hypocrisy of the people you work for. You don't even know who you work for, do you? I jammed the transfer, But ran a mimic program to make it look like it went through. Boy genius does it again. I'm feeling tingly all over. Get that, mike? Transfer is complete, baby. We're good to go. Hate to chat and run. But we'll be needing your car. Hand over agent rivai first. What, do you think we're stupid? She's our only bargaining chip. Toss the gun. Drop it! Kitt, you know what to do. Yes, michael. You're really gonna regret this. Shut up before we shoot you. Where're the keys? There are no keys. Agent rivai, protocol alpha, charlie, beta, seven. Copy that, kitt. Hey, the doors are locked. You okay? Uh huh. So what have we learned about relationships today, kitt? Men and women are erratic, unpredictable, and irrational. I believe I have learned nothing. No, kitt, you've learned everything. Predictability takes all the fun Out of a relationship. In addition, I searched the municipal codes Of every city in the united states. There is no such thing as the make out rule. What? You told zoe you can't park in a car At night without making out. And that it's a rule. Well, it may not be in any database, But it's a rule. Trust me. Well, it's night, And you are both in a parked car. Rules are rules. Really? Mike and sarah are approaching. Duck! Hey. Hey. Hear the news? What? Congress quietly doubled our funding. Huh. I wonder if that has anything to do With the charges being dropped against nikki? And poor max is gonna serve 20 to life. What a boy won't do for a girl. I was just thinking the same thing.
