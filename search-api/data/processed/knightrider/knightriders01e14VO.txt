You got your panties in a bunch?! You got an answer for me,Princess? You think this is funny? You think this is a game? Michael,how much longer must we watch this? I'm sorry,Kitt,it's the only footage Annie had of the guy. Army news video of sgt. Jack Burber, "the meanest drill sergeant west of the Mississippi in training." Yep. What,exactly,is he training people in? The usual... shooting,fighting... Breaking the human spirit. I thought you said the human spirit couldn't be broken. Doesn't stop people from trying. Mike,you're still not there? I am 15 minutes away. You guys find out any more about sgt. Burber's death? Only what was in the local paper. Small town. Army vet. Overdose." Then the story goes away. You think Annie is overreacting? Annie Ortiz kept my company's Blackhawks running During two weeks of heavy fire and did not lose her cool once. If she says there's something off about her D.I.'s death, It's worth looking into. - Even if it is this guy.  - We're on it. Oh,I like the sexy librarian look. Are you laughing?! You think this is  some kinda game?! Okay,we'll play a game then! All of you on your face and give me 20, You bunch of ignorant,miserable,worthless bags of... Should be fun. Just so you know,I tried to handle this solo Before putting the call out. The lawman here is an idiot. For starters,death by overdose? Sarge didn't do drugs. You did say he was having a rough time,though. Yeah,you would too if you had just risked your butt For your country, Then got out and found no one gave a crap. Look,maybe it was harder on him than most, But he was getting it together. How do you know? For the past six months I've been loaning him cash Pretty regularly. Then last week he says not to worry, He was was "onto something" out here. Two days later I get a call from this idiot sheriff Who says sarge od'd,and I'm the only contact on record. You see the body? Hospital rules. He's got no blood relatives,so I gotta wait a week. I really glad that you can help. I'll see what I can do. Great. Mike... despite Annie's feelings,the chance of a veteran dying from an overdose is surprisingly high. According to government data,one in eight soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. and over 12,000 veterans attempted suicide last year alone. Maybe so. Still,Annie's asked,so we gotta check it out. The database and the county hospital and clinic indicates sgt. Burber's body is in examination room three. I have uncovered the name  of another deceased individual who is also being held here, and I am providing appropriate I.D. Kevin Lee? Son of Peter Lee,recently expired of natural causes. Quiet Zone Let's go see dad. Death does change a man. Just the other day,he and I were laughing over... a pu-pu platter,and now... Can I get a moment here? All right,wise guy,I'm in. Hospital data has Sgt. Burber's body awaiting an autopsy in a body bag that should be evident. Got it. Unh. Hey,Sarge. You look different in person. Nicer. Michael? Jeez,Kitt! It occurs to me you have limited experience in forensic science, so you will need assistance in examining the body. What do you mean "examining"? Sgt. Burber's time of death is listed as 11:00 p.m. Friday with overdose as the cause. Annie has said she feels this assessment is lacking. Therefore,another examination is needed. Uh,what would I have to do? The reports suggest Sgt. Burber may have died from secobarbital poisoning. Look at the sergeant's lips. Do they appear redder than normal? Yeah. He's got a pretty nasty bruise on his jaw. The sheriff's report also suggests that Sgt. Burber's body was bruised during transportation from the roadside where he was found. This,however,is a problem. Why? Bodies do not bruise after death. Looks like there's something on his shirt? Sawdust. And down by his neck is a really big,nasty mark. That suggests asphyxia. We need to check for petechial hemorrhaging. Okay. Lift the sergeant's eyelids and closely examine the conjunctiva of the eyes. - Dude,I'm not doing that.  - Michael... It's dead eyeballs. Then you can be assured they won't bite. Look for red dots on the gelatinous outer rim of the eye, and within the sergeant's eyelid. Hey,yeah,I see them. He's got the dots. That means Annie was right. The sarge didn't o.d. That is correct,Michael. Sgt. Burber was murdered. You discovered he was murdered,and tampered with the body? Well,not in that order. And anyway,I barely touched him. After lying to a hospital employee and impersonating a dead Samoan's son. Come on,Sarah, next you're gonna say I shouldn't have taken his personal effects. You took his personal effects? Well,I wasn't gonna go through them there. Great,now going to the police is definitely out. No problem... all we need is to find out who had motive,means,and opportunity. We do that,we have our killer. Impressive,Sherlock. Please. Matlock. Motive means an opportunity,huh? Okay,that's what I'll ask the sheriff. No,Mike,I said we can't go to the police. First some army girl tries to tell me How to run my investigation. And then you go messing with the body. I didn't mess with it,sir. Just looking out for one of my own. That ain't your job. What about when the job calls murder a suicide? Hey... That was a preliminary assessment. I haven't had time to get into the details. Okay,I get it. You're overworked. Probably the one guy who has to handle the whole county. It must give you a lot of... - Stress?!  - Yeah. - You got no idea.  - So maybe I can help. Or maybe I can just arrest you. You could do that. But like you said, I'm not the first to look into this. And if you put me away,I won't be the last. Attention all county units, Bank robbery in progress at rancher's national bank. Cutter responding. You mess with any of this? I haven't even broken the seal,sir. If I find anything's missing... I will be at the hotel in town. I'll throw your ass in jail. Now get! I think he likes me. Rancher's bank? The bank is on the other side of the county, which gives us an hour before the Sheriff realizes My report was erroneous. Great. So what'd you find? - Find?  - Come on,super car. I put the bag of the Sarge's stuff on your hood. You have surface tech there. And I wanted it to be a surprise. The items in Sgt. Burber's personal effects Include American coins and currency, A watch,the sergeant's I.D., And a matchbook from Newcomb's ranch bar, Which seems to contain flecks of sawdust. Like the sawdust on sarge's shirt in the morgue. Exactly. Newcomb's ranch sounds like it might be nearby. It is. That's why we're driving there now. Okay. Beautiful. The Newcomb's ranch bar Doesn't have anything unusual on its business records,Mike. No report of criminal activity,either, Though the place did get a new owner last year. Anything on your end? Just that this bar's A frikkin' long way out of town. Michael,the Newcomb's ranch bar Is just up ahead. Thanks. My scanners have identified nothing unusual On the main floor. But the basement is radiating far more electricity Than one would predict from a bar. Any way to get a picture of what's down there? It will take some time to penetrate the substructure, But I will try. And so will I. You lost? Looking for a beer. We don't get a lot of that out here. This... is a bar,isn't it? It's for locals, And you and I have never met. Uh... Mike. Constance. Oh,that's a nice tat. Army? Good eye. Yeah,well,I got a thing for men in uniform. You in or out? Out. Uh,left ordnance at Fort Carson two weeks ago, and,you know,here I am. Ordnance,huh? You miss the 75th? It's the 76th,actually. And no,I'm just happy to be here. Michael,according to Billy's latest update, Constance Savage is the new owner of the bar. After all,I heard this is where I'd find the best-looking bartender in the state. She not only runs the place,she owns it. What else have you heard? I should ask what's downstairs. Well,why don't you follow me and find out? - Hey.  - Do it. That's enough! What the hell is this?! Call it a test. Don't worry,you passed. Still wanna see my downstairs? How could I say no? Ty! I got another one for you. Hey,you think you can do this? What is this? It's fight night! Yeah! Get up! Michael,I have just accessed the lower level via their closed-circuit system. It's about time. Actually,my processing speed was quite impressive. Do you think this place might be connected to Sergeant Burber's death? I think it was where he was killed. From what we can tell,fight night is controlled by a self-styled promoter and vet named Ty Mckelver. It's also one of the fastest-growing Internet sites on the web. So it's like boxing? It's more hardcore than boxing. Every night they live-stream at least three bouts. No rules,no refs. Most of the fighters are vets. Winner gets three grand,cash. Loser goes home. That's a lot to put yourself through for three grand. Not for these guys. Most are hard cases, desperate for anything they can get. I'd be desperate too up against that. That is "Monster" Molina, fight night's reigning champ, and the most horrifying thing I've seen on the web since mini-me uncut. Okay,can't you guys just call in the cavalry? Not yet. Busting these guys won't get us any closer to finding out what happened to the sarge. You're sure he was there? From what I saw at the hospital and the club,yeah. Think you can find a witness? Good luck with this crowd? What about the web? They post every match. But they do it via a read-only live stream that's up during the fights. Once the fights are over,they're gone. That's marketing. Keeps up demand. Then where are the highlight reels? They gotta be hanging on to recordings of past fights. And if sarge was in the crowd, maybe one of the cameras caught something. All right,we'll look into Ty and his web site. You and Kitt go back to the club and see what you can find. So what time you wanna head over to the bar? Annie,I gotta do this alone. No way. If anyone should be taking care of this, it's me. - I don't think so.  - I do. Mike,the sarge saved my life. What are you talking about? The last week of basic... I was ready to quit. But the sarge knew that,for me, that would be going right back to everything I had been trying to get away from. When I gave him my D.O.R.,he wouldn't take it. He said,"You can do it. Don't give up." He made me who I am,Mike. I owe him. And that is why you can't go. You're too close. Well,you can't stop me. No,but my car can. Right. How'd you... Hey! Hey! Michael,it would be easier for my sensors to access the club if we parked a little closer. I'm supposed to be desperate for a cage fight,Kitt. I can't be rolling up in a supercar. Sadly,I have no hooptie application at this time. Given the centralization of RF cables, it appears all the camera feeds go into this room in the basement,adjacent to the fight cage. Anything in there you can see? No,but the level of magnetic radiation suggests the presence of digital tapes. I guess it's time for round two. I'm here to fight. Not with you. And he's back. Hmm. He's early. I wanted to make sure I got a shot tonight. Yeah,well,I don't make my picks Till I see who's here. Of course,if you want to make yourself useful,soldier, you can... you can grab a broom. Whatever it takes. You army boys don't quit,do you? Nope. Me,I'm a navy seal. Seals are tough. Yeah... It was cool. Got to kick a lot of ass. Is that how you got into this? - To keep kickin' ass?  - No. This is all about the money,my man. So the fights are fixed. Hell no. If I did that,nobody'd watch. This is as real as it gets. Must feel pretty weird Messing up other vets for cash. Hey... You got a better offer,take it. Most of my guys are happy to be able to make some cash, not to mention the opportunity to be famous. Famous? Yeah. Take Monster from last night. Two months,never been beat. Three million hits on Google,and climbing. That could be you. All it takes is one good fight. What about a great fight? Now we're talkin'. There was this knob of a drill sergeant I had in basic. I heard he came this way. Thought I'd get a little payback. His name was Jack Berber. Yeah,you know,I'm sorry, But Jack... He's no longer with us. He,uh... It was in the paper. Overdose. Guess I'll have to settle for someone else then. I guess you will,army. I guess you will. Fight night! Fight night! Fight... Tonight,right? You gonna be there? - I'll be there.  - Yeah! Ty Mckelver is an exploitation king. Before coming up with fight night, he was the scum-meister behind bum battles,dog eat dog, and Ghetto girl smackdown. - The one with the rolling pin...  - Yeah. He's not even a vet. He was never in the armed services. He got kicked out of film school. Ha! Doesn't get any lower than that. I don't understand. If this is the guy behind all this, why hasn't he been arrested yet? He has expensive lawyers and keeps moving from state to state to change up jurisdiction. That explains his hook-up with Constance Savage. Sociopathic capitalists and the women who love them. Uh,she's no angel. Five years ago she was co-defendant in a pretty big sweat shop case in Denver. - Poor workers...  - Homeless vets? It's like they find the most vulnerable people, and then take advantage of them on a massive scale. We've gotta bust these guys. I can keep digging into their backgrounds and see if anything useable shows up. I'll keep trolling the web for more stuff on fight night. If it turns out Ty doesn't keep archives, maybe the fight night fans do. Yeeeaah! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to fight night! For tonight's first spectacle, we are gonna give you a big,bruising brawl that's sure to be a classic. Army... Yeah... Versus navy! Kitt,I'm in. About time,Michael. I don't see you down here. You should not be looking for me. You should be looking for a tape that corresponds to the date of Sgt. Burber's death. I don't see any tapes. Given the amount of magnetic radiation emanating from the room, there should be tapes. I don't see a group of tapes. Have you checked for secret panels in the wall at the east end of the room? I think I got it. What the hell are you doing? Cleaning up. Is everything okay in here? You tell me. Good news. You're up. Fight night! Fight night! Michael,you should be headed for the exit. And instead,you are headed for the fight cage. I'm working on an out. What's the matter? Nervous acid reflux. You got a bathroom around here? Sure,but I don't think you want to leave your partner all alone. Partner? It's the two of them versus you... And her. I told you you couldn't stop me. Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen, For our next event tonight, we are bringing you not one on one... Not one on two... But two on two! Yeah! Fight night presents the beauties... and the beasts! Beauties? What kind of name is... aah! Unh! I think I got something. It's a ripped file on a shared network and it's titles "fight night choke-out." It's dated the same night as sgt. Burber's death. What just happened? It looked like monster was about to kill sgt. Burber. - Well,play the rest of it.  - I can't. File ends there. We gotta warn Mike. Too late for that. Mike and Annie are in the cage now. Mike,what are you doing? You were supposed to get the tape and get out. Yeah,I got sidetracked. Unh! Well,get un-sidetracked! Get over here! Aah! Kitt,a little help here. I'm analyzing your opponent's physiology and posture to anticipate his next move. Knee to the groin. Good call. Movement analysis recommencing. Just tell me what to do! Unh! Sidestep to your left now. - Just like old times,right?  - Yeah. Except for people weren't cheering for our blood. Sarge used to say if the enemy's in range,so are you. - Not bad.  - Not bad yourself. Mike,stop goofing around and get out of there. Don't worry,we got these guys. Mike,you don't understand. From what we can tell, monster killed sgt. Burber. And the only evidence of it is on that tape. What is it? We gotta get away from this guy. You just figure something out about sarge? Annie,we gotta get away from this guy now. It was him? - Annie. Annie!  - Aah! Michael,look out. Aah... - You're tappin' out?!  - We're out! Kitt! Kitt... Commencing internal scan. Michael,Annie has suffered a collapsed lung and is in need of immediate medical attention. Let's get her to the hospital. Hey! I knew you weren't here just to fight. Good thing monster has quick hands,huh? Kitt,get Annie out of here. Who are you? Michael? I gotta get the tape back. I said who are you?! Go! Get him! I'll get the car. Mike? Please relax,Ms. Ortiz. I will have you at the hospital shortly. I am one of Michael's associates. My name is Kitt. Incoming emergency. Please assist. The victim has a punctured lung. Mike,do you read us? Mike? Still nothing. Both his earwig and GPS crapped out... Right after he left that bar. He might as wall be on the dark side of the moon. Stop. You two stay here. You come with me. Aah! Kitt,do you have anything? I've had no contact with Michael... ... since delivering Annie to the hospital. However,given his last position, I have isolated a promising search area, and I'm entering it now. Transformation. Transformation completed. Hello? Zoe,it's Mike. God,are you all right? I need Kitt now. I'll patch you through. Michael,it is good to hear you. What is your location? I don't know. I got a,uh... ... a dirt road by an old white shack, maybe ten miles west of the bar. Can you I.D. it? Accessing my global photo database. Dirt road,white shack. Nine miles from the bar. I have it. I'll meet you there. Kitt at the evac point yet? No. Why? Look what I found. Bank records? For Ty Mckelver. Every time Monster wins a match, Ty's account bumps up five,maybe six figures. Because of the popularity of the fights? No. He's betting on them. Check this out. I ran a reverse trace on the account... ... after the fight last night against Mike and Annie. Ty made quite a haul. And after he does, look who he transfers half the money to. About time,Ki... I knew it was you. Yep,it's me. Got a report of gunfire around this way. That you too? No,sir. Looked into that case of yours. You were right. Your friend was killed. Now I'm trying to get to the bottom of it. You got anything that might help me do that? Like maybe a tape? You gotta stick your nose where it don't belong. Now give it! You've been working for Ty the whole time. Yeah. He's got your girlfriend,so quit stalling. We don't want no more people asking no more questions. You want to give it to him in person? I'll take you there myself. No,thanks. I've got my own ride. Uhh! What... Kitt,open the back door window. Good night. Nice of you to finally show up,by the way. If you hadn't lost your earwig, You'd have been much easier to track. Tell me you got him. I got most of 'em,Ty,and now I'm comin' to get you. You mean you're coming to give me my tape. And you're gonna give me Annie. Half an hour. - Come alone.  - Sure. Just me and my car. Mike,state police are 20 minutes out with the FBI on their tail. No time. Gotta go now. But after what was on the tape... We know exactly what to do,Sarah. Annie,you okay? That Sheriff yanked me from the hospital. I'll be okay when I get some payback. Nice little reunion. Now drop the gun and give me my tape! First tell me why you were hanging on to it. You never know what people are gonna want to watch next. One day it's a cage fight,next it's murder? What are you talking about? Oh,I watched the tape. Kitt,show him. The Sarge was gonna take out your star and leave you with a huge betting loss. So you did what you had to do. Kitt,zoom in and freeze. Because you blocked in,no one could see you. But your camera just did. You killed him. That's as real as it gets. Now let her go. It's over. Heh heh heh. No,it's not. Don't do it,Michael. Heh heh heh heh heh. Uuh! Unh! No tap out this time. - You got that right.  - Unh! What are you waiting for?! Go stop him! What the hell is wrong with you,Private?! This is for the Sarge. Hey. Did the footage finish uploading? Uploaded to the state police,the FBI,and the World Wide Web. There's not a jury in this country. That'll let Ty and his buddies go now. It still doesn't bring the man back. No. But maybe it will give his friend some peace. Yeah. Thanks,Sarah. You good? Yeah. Just making arrangements to have the sergeant shipped to Harlington. You know how you said he made you who you are? Yeah. He did a great job. Thanks. Michael,are you all right? Yeah. Just a little black and blue from Ty and his gang. Well,you know what Sgt. Burber says. The pain is temporary,but the pride is forever. You'd make a good drill sergeant,Kitt. Thank you. Now drop and give me 20. Private Knight,you worthless bag of...
