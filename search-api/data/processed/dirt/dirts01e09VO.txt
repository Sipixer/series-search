for Dirt Now magazine. This is my best friend and editor</i> Lucy Spiller. In last week's episode, Julia got a visit in rehab from Holt. - These are cold. She got cold chicken wings... - Sorry. ...and an apology. Lucy also got a visit from Holt.</i> She got, well... - Choke me. ...something a little more personal. And in this episode, blah blah blah happens.</i> Enjoy. Wish we had that surveillance footage from your work parking garage. We could sprint right through to the finish line. Come on. You don't think vandals knocked out that camera, do you ? Whoever did, broke into two other cars. Could be a coincidence... or not. We tried to trace the IP address from the IM you got, but it came from an unregistered server. Any hack could have sent it. He left this in my paper this morning. What makes you think it's a he? Because I don't know any woman who has that kind of time on her hands. Open your eyes wide. It's the only way to see what you can't look at. This is a haiku. Five syllables followed by seven, then five again. So I'm being stalked by a poet? And not a very good one. Haiku are usually about the seasons, nature, that sort of thing. Well, you're my security guy. What do we do? Nothing. You're saying I don't need to worry about this? Didn't say that. People's biggest mistake is engaging these assholes. That'll be his foot in the door. This is about control. Absolute control equals true love. If you engage him in any manner, then it's game on for him. See, your rejection isn't complete if he's still screwing with your life. No offense, but I've been to parades with fewer people than your list of possible suspects. None taken. If it were smaller, I'd be unemployed. Let me whittle this down to 10 or so, and we'll go from there. Okay, good luck. Do you know anyone with any kind of mental illness? Paranoia ? Schizophrenia ? Erotomania ? A lot of these stalkers have very rigid personalities. - They're maladaptive. - No. No one springs to mind. Excuse me. Have you heard the news? Okay, let's save some time here and assume that I haven't. Your cover story on Dana Pritchard and Joey Perez's upcoming wedding It's been called off. That's bullshit. I've approved $700,000 for their exclusive rights. I've got three covers tied up in this. Dana's publicist called. They're sending out a press release in an hour. All right. I'm on my way in. I want you to get Don Konkey and everyone else. Tell them to be in the conference room in 20 minutes. Also call Dana and Joey's publicists. Now, Kenny. If these assholes screw up my cover, you'll have a few more names to put on that list. Hey, baby. Hey. It's Daddy. What are you doing? You being a good girl? That sounds like a lot of fun. I have to go now. Daddy loves you past the sun. I love you the most. Say bye-bye. Bye-bye. Synchro: YST</i> Transcript: Swsub.com</i> _/Yellow Sub\_ Proudly Present:</i> Dirt - Season 01 Episode 09 "This Is Not Your Father's Hostage Situation" Don't. I don't want those. Jimmy, there were here two days ago, and she still had a little of the ride over on her chin. But I know that he's on a plane to Miami by himself. Right. Okay, so there's an illness in her family, and he goes on vacation. Okay, don't take this personally, but you're an idiot. Which is not my objection. My objection is that you would assume I would believean idiot. Listen, I want you to pull all the photos from the last 24 hours. - I wanna know everywhere they've been. - Got it. Okay, Jimmy, You better tell me the truth. Because if I have to work to get it out of you, you ain't gonna like it. New story. How it all fell apart. - McPherson ? - Well, I spoke with Dana's agent. She's tap dancing like crazy. First, her sick relative was her aunt. Then it was her grandmother. Either they're dropping like flies in the Pritchard household or they're just flying by the seat of their pants. Sounds like someone hit his fianc√©e again. I don't think so. Spoke to Joey's people, and sounds like they've cornered the market on righteous indignation. So it's her ? His agent says that all further inquiry should be handled through Dana's people. Okay, let's do a little good cop/bad cop. Terry and Willa, I want you to help Dana deal with her guilt, while you 2 become drinking buddies with the Perez camp, see what you can get. What other job allows you to expense a strip club ? Why does it always have to be a strip club ? We've got 24 hours. You all know the drill. Sorry. It's this... It's just this damn medication. It's just nice to be next to you again. God, I wish you didn't have to go. I'll just be an hour tops. Clean out my trailer, then I'll be back. You smell so good. You sure there's nothing I can help you with? You like that ? I have something you can do. - Holt. - Shh. - Look-- - Did I say you could speak ? No. Is it still in your ass ? It better be. Meet me in the supply closet in 20 minutes. Sammy Winter called again.He said it was about a follow-up interview. We've done enough stories on Sammy Winter and his... futile attempt at rehab, his prostitutes, the trials and tribulations of being a child star. So unless he's banging an Olsen twin or he has bought some ad space, I don't give a shit. Johnny Gage is in your office. Johnny Gage is in my office and you open with Sammy Winter ? Way to bury a lead. What are you doing, Gage ? Just checking out the power seat. And what do you want ? I've got a scoop on something I thought might interest you. Joey Perez didn't call off the wedding. - Dana did. - No shit. We're all over that. What if I told you that Dana broke it off because she's switching to an all-carpet diet? I'd tell you to get to the point. First a little quid pro quota. - Where's the love? - Come again? Johnny Gage has disappeared from the pages of <i>DirtNow</i>. What's with that ? I guess we ran out of different ways to tell about you screwing strippers. - I want a cover. - And I want a private jet. DirtNow is not gonna blow you over some half-assed speculation. Trust me. This is full-assed. She was supposed to meet him for lunch yesterday. Totally blew him off. Called him from the chick's cell phone. - Hope Duggan ? - Yep. Dude's major messed up over this. She's not even that good-looking. I, uh, did her once in the parking lot of Whole Foods. Shit. We had it right the whole time. Dana said she thought about it and would rather lose her career than Hope. I was so ahead of the curve on this one. I was at their house, and their TiVo is all, like, Ellenshows. I gotta take this. - Give your story to Terry. - What about my cover ? I'll work on it. Shut the door. Hold on one second. Who's Terry ? Hey. The movie's wrapped. Oh, great. Just in time for Julia's homecoming. How is she ? She's okay, I guess. What is it you want, Holt ? I don't know. Well, call me when you do. No, no, wait. Lucy. Look, I need to see you. Why ? Come on. Does it have to be like this ? I need to hear it. All you need to do is ask, Holt. Hey, look, I can't stop thinking about you.</i> You know, it's like you're in my head all the time.</i> You know... I need to be... with you. You mean inside of me ? I can't. I have a lot of work to do. Call me later. Hi. What's with the ugly luggage ? It's little Tristan. He's having trouble peeing He's got a vet's appointment in an hour. - Are you feeding him wet or dry? - Mainly dry. What's the ash content ? What are you talking about ? I took a year of veterinary medicine before I decided to switch to journalism. High contents of ash can usually cause Feline Urologic Syndrome. It's basically a blockage of the urinary tract. It's very common in male cats. How's his stool ? I got some in the car. You wanna take a look? - Yeah. It'd be a pleasure. - That's great. That's money well-spent. Hey, Don. I need you to cover Hope Duggan's hangouts. - Again? - Again. Come on, move ! Move ! Back off ! Get down on the floor ! Stay down ! Get back ! There's a man with a gun. Down ! Hey, Lucy. Get down, you stupid-looking bastard. Back off ! Back off ! Get down ! Down ! Down ! Back off, buddy ! That's right ! Get down ! Look away ! Everybody back off ! Hi, Lucy. In the future, when Sammy Winter calls, it's best you take it. Listen up. Everybody... I want all your cell phones, Blackberries, whatever-you-got communication device in this basket, Now ! Come on ! Give it to me ! Put it in here ! Come on ! Hurry up ! Hurry up ! Come on! Thank you. Thank you. Good boy. Come on ! Give it to me ! Come on ! Give it up ! Hurry up ! Give it to me. Very good. You. Both. No one moves. Good job. Thank you. Thank you. Very good. All the exits have been padlocked, so everybody just get comfy. Get comfy. Everybody does exactly as they're told, no one will get hurt. Got that ? No one gets hurt. If anybody wants to get cute, I've got enough explosives here to blow us all into pizza toppings. Are we clear ? Everybody's clear, right ? All the exits are padlocked. Only way out's through the bullpen, that's where the gunman is. - God. Did he shoot anybody ? - I don't think so. I think it was just to get their attention. What is your plan? My plan is for us to be as quiet as church mice until this whole thing is over. Hiding while others may die is not a plan. Neither is rushing a gunman from 40 feet away with your cleaning lady. You okay ? Maybe you can create a diversion. Or maybe we can sit here like I just said and let this thing play out ! American men, you have no balls. - I'm okay. - Buddy... I know you're pissed, buddy... but I will blow your brains out. I'm okay. Don, I'm okay. Don ! God damn it, look at me ! Go ahead, Don. - I'm okay. - Come on. - Do you understand ? - Go ahead, Don. - Do you understand ? - Gimme that ice. Sweetheart, - gimme your blouse. - What ? I need it to wrap the ice. - Come on ! - You can have my shirt. Thanks, buddy... But that much cologne that close to her face will cause brain damage. Give it to me, princess ! Give it to me ! Come on ! Here you go. Put this on you... I'm sorry, okay ? I had to let everyone know that I mean business, okay ? Take out the ram, the sheep fall into place, all right ? Seriously, though, would it have killed you to call me back ? Who are you ? Look at this guy. Look at this guy. Who is this guy ? He's gonna pretend that he doesn't know who I am. 'Cause God forbid you should give me the satisfaction of your measly acknowledgment, right ? His name is Sammy Winter. He's a former child star from a show <i>Buster Rules. That's right. '81 through '89. Buster Rules. 2-time People's Choice winner. Ring a bell, buddy ? Remember ? Jesus Christ. This guy's a... Okay, Sammy, you've got my attention. What is it that you want ? I want you, to keep your promise. That's what I want. I want you to keep your promise. - Meaning? - Meaning... 1989. Buster Rules about to wrap a 9-year run as perennial top 20 show. That's right. I pick a young go-getter named... Lucy Spiller. Yeah, at <i>TV Guide</i>. I pick her over all the others to do my exclusive. - Ring a bell, Lucy ? - Of course it does That's right. I was gonna do a cover. And you said you owed me. Those were your words, Lucy. Your words. You owe me. Well, I'm here to collect. Company. Beautiful. Company. Come on ! Don, please ! Please ! - Please, Don. - It's okay. Back up ! It's gonna be okay. Thank you for the shirt. Do you really think everything's gonna be all right ? Absolutely. Let's go. Come on. Keep 'em coming. We don't have time! Yeah? Well, then we're gonna have to find a way to make enough time, okay? I mean, what-- who's your cover this month? Who is it? Joey Perez and Dana Pritchard. That's crap, man! I've shat out things more interesting than those two. Do a story on me. Dedicated to Sammy Winter, okay? What I'm really like. How I'm the most misunderstood person in Hollywood. We can touch on my alcoholism, the infidelities. We'll do the whole story behind the story. The whole thing. - A beautiful cover. - Excuse me. Johnny Gage! Now way! Dude. Dude... Ladies and gentlemen, Johnny Gage in the house. Dude. Good to see you, dude. You look great. - Great. - Thanks, man. Got a movie going, right? Big movie? Listen, this guy was on my show back in the day. My radio show. You remember that? - Sure. Great show. - Great show. How-- how's it going? I got fired yesterday. Do you believe that shit? And they kept on that talent less bitch. Man, she was about as entertaing as a pledge drive. I'm so sorry, man. I'm-- Look, I'm working on this new movie. I have a meeting. I was wondering if I could, you know, go. Dude. You're Johnny Gage. Thank you. - Thanks, man. - They'll reschedule. Sit down. Come on. Let's start-- Let him go. Let half of these people go. What are they gonna do? Call the cops? No. Everybody stays. Look, no disrespect, man, but she's right. What have any of us ever done to you? You stopped caring. Why do you carry on with this one? He has no character. We're just co-workers. So, what... you were in a meeting when I walked in? Please. Besides, who do you think cleans up after you at night? - The condom fairy? - I'm sorry, dear. What's your name? Maria. How original. Maria, shut the hell up. Is it hard to hear? That you're a coward? - Oh, my God. - Sitting there with your knees in your chest, like a fetus. Why do you give it away to this? Could you just shut up? I can tell a lot about a man from his office. Your friend has no photos. No girlfriend, no wife, no smiling children watching him from inside the frame while he does his work. Just things. Nothing that tells us why he's here. Willa, what's the matter? I can't breathe. Willa. She's claustrophobia. Breathe. What? I really like that piece you did on sneaker freaks. Thanks. I'm a total sneaker freak. I waited in line 36 hours for these limited edition SB Dunks. I'm a Converse gal. SBs are cool, though. "Who are your biggest influences?" "What was your favorite episode of Buster Rules?" I mean, no one's gonna wanna read this. The hostage situation here at Dirt Now magazine...</i> It just got picked up national. The gunman has now been confirmed to be...</i> - This is my white Bronco. - <i>...Eddie Winter.</i> - <i>In addition to having</i> - Look at that. Winter is believed to have a bomb strapped to his body,</i> making the negotiators strategy that much more difficult.</i> Thanks, Jane. We have more information on what is now being referred to as the Sammy Winter saga. The controversial editor of the tabloid Dirt Now, Lucy Spiller,</i> is confirmed as one of the hostages inside the building.</i> Sammy Winter, 38, started in television at the age of 6--</i> Six years old. Quiet, quiet, quiet. We'll listen. He parlayed that into several 70s Movies of the Week.</i> Guys, how does it feel to be part of television history, people? - This is great! - <i>...and theM. O. W. Confessions</i> of Thalidomide Baby. I loved that movie. That was great. - Very good. - I've got a deal for you. I'm all ears, baby. What do you got for me? Let's scrap the bullshit questions. You let me tell the first-person story from inside the cris, and I will give you the mother of all covers. Okay. But what's the Sammy angle? A one-on-one with me. Everything you wanted to know about Sammy Winter but were afraid to ask. Good. Good stuff. One-on-one with Sammy Winter. 8 pages. Full spreads. And a second sidebar reporting from inside the siege. Let me do my job the way I know how, and I will make you a star. Sweetheart, I am a star. You just need to remind people, okay? Come on! We got a magazine to put out! Come on! Do your magazine thing, whatever you guys do. Let's do it! Good stuff. Very good, Lucy. What do you like about me? You're shitting me, right? No, I wanna know. What do you like? Well, I don't know. You're warm and have no standards. Your ass is so out the door when this is over. Am I wrong? A little girl with your eyes shut and legs open. You are candy, nothing more. Your assumption is arrogant, and your face is starting to piss me off. Besides, I'm the one in control. He's the one with the 3-inch butt plug in his ass. He dared me to take it to the next level, and I did. Right, honey? Oh, my God. Okay, everything but the cover story has to be locked and out of the building by 9:00. I want a splashy cover. I want you to go to Photoshop, pull all the pictures of Sammy from different points in his career. - That's a good idea. - All right. Where's McPherson? I think she got out. Lucky her. All right, Naomi, let's hold off on the "Anorexia in Hollywood" piece, and ask makeup if there are any filler ads that we can drop. Okay. - Don? - Hurry up. I want you staying with me. I'm gonna need to develop the film. What do you mean develop? Can't you use digital or something? No. Only film. He's not right, is he? He's the best there is. He's gonna need access to the photo lab which in on the second floor. Okay. You know, Don, I trust you. You only look stupid. I bet you there's a whole lotta shit going on up there in the attic, huh? Oh! I'm on TV! There I am! I'm gonna need a tape recorder. And someone get me some food. Lucy. Lucy, I need to leave. Gage, I don't know if you've noticed, but there's a guy over there with a gun who's calling the shots. Talk to him. I gotta go. I got-- I feel sick. Gage. Gage. What's up, dude? I need to go. You know what movie you were great in? The Deal. You remember that one? You're the hostage negotiator, and you played by your own rules. That movie rocked, dude. Critics panned it. It grossed over $200 million worldwide. The critics. What do they know? Sit down. Sit down. Sit down! I wanna ask you something. Sit down. Listen. I may need a little help with the end of this one. You know what I mean? Be great to have you on as a consultant. Winter is said to have enough dynamite strapped to his body</i> to level the entire building. That is a direct quote from Winter himself.</i> And though there is no truth validating that claim...</i> God, this is awful. Yeah. They've shut Wilshire down all the way to San Vincente. Is that for tonight? Yeah. I'm a little nervous. Screw it. Let's just stay here. Come on. It's your wrap party. We have to go. I just... Never mind. What? Just say it. The tape. The tape of me and... It's out there and... I don't know who's seen it or who has it and... No one's seen it, I prom-- Listen, I promise you. How do you know that? I don't-- I don't even understand how you saw it. And you won't talk to me about who-- Just-- just trust me. But how... How come I have to trust you? Why can't you just tell me? Who are you trying to protect, Holt? Because it sure doesn't feel like me. Listen to me. I'll always take care of you. Come on, you know that, babe. Why don't you slip into that little dress, and you and me can go out and have a good time. Spiller, known throughout Hollywood as one of the most</i> powerful people in the art of... I had a head cold when we filmed that. So I spent the whole day looping, trying to get my dialogue intelligible, you know? And... I went home... and my mom was like... "Dad's gone." He cleaned us out. Just took off. Like... like he checked out of a hotel. Did you ever see him again? Nope. Uncle got a letter from him a couple of years ago, but... Do you have any idea... what it's like to lose the compass in your life? To have them just split like that? Nothing left to exonerate you. Just... split. You know? Leaving you to fill in the blanks. You know, I can forgive the guy for taking off, taking every last penny. It's just the cruelty that I'm have trouble coming to terms with. He must have really... just hated us. It's not his hate. It's his indifference. Indifference is worse. And now with live-breaking news, we go back to the scene.</i> There's been little contact with Sammy Winter.</i> since the early moments of the siege. Negotiators say this one may drag on for a least a day or two.</i> Since the cancellation... That perm was a big, big mistake. - Nice perm. - Tell me about it. God. I don't know. I mean... I love her, but I'm not inlove with her, you know? Yeah, totally. You can't live your life for someone else, you know? I mean, I'm always gonna be there for the kid and stuff and... God, I feel like such a loser saying that. You are not a loser. Look at me. I am looking. And I see a sexy, sweet, nice guy that anybody'd be lucky to have. I don't have a shot yet. - This one's pretty good. - It's not it. I'll get it, though. I know you will. You feel bad for him, don't you? I'm just concerned about getting us out of here safely. When I was growing up, we used to have this poodle called Frenchie. Frenchie? Whenever my dad would come home, he'd walk right past me and my mom and go play with the dog, like we weren't even there. He tried his best. He was the one that got me into wearing hats. He wore hats all the time. When he'd come home drunk he'd say, "The best way to sober up is put on your hat." It reminded him of when he used to be somebody. I bought him this hat, but he never wore it. I love hats. You thinking about your dad? I was at a friend's house... before I came home and found him. And I had had a cigarette. My first and only one. And I remember being so scared that my dad was gonna smell it on me that I walked home, and I was just trying to get the smoke out of my hair. And when I saw him... hanging there, I actually thought for one second that God was punishing me for smoking. I think... sometimes... life is too small for dads. ...I'm Ray Herrera. Back to you. Pretty messed up, huh? It really sucks. They were gonna do a story about my work rescuing dogs. Do you think they'll still do it? - What? - My rescue work with dogs? Do you still think they'll do the story? You know, provided they don't all get shot. It's just something that I'm really passionate about, you know? No idea. You know... you got hard during one of our loves scenes. What are you talking about? No, I didn't. The one where I was riding you? I could feel it. Pushed a little harder so it felt good for you. Well... and me. Damn. Dude. Dude! A cat? You take pictures of a cat and you got me right here? I'm waiting for the right moment. I got dogs, four of them. I'm a dog man myself. - What's its name? - Tristan. Dude, you gotta get a dog. Cats are for, uh, you know, those kind of guys. I like cats. Cats are quiet and loving, and they know when to give you your space. I say it's dogs all the way. That's 'cause you're a narcissist. You can't live without excessive admiration, adulation, attention, and affirmation. Dogs will give you that. Their love is like a mirror of how you'd like to perceive yourself as seen by others. Oh, really? Most likely a result of your bitter disappointment and radical disillusionment with significant others during childhood. Anything else, Freud? Four dogs is a lot. Bang. Thank you. So there's definite interest from USA Network to do a pilot. I mean, they're flattered that you would even consider it, since you just worked - with Johnny... shit-for-brains. - Yeah. - Do you love your husband? - Pardon? Your husband Ted, do you still love him? Yeah. Of course. Are you okay? My father has diabetes. Years ago he told my mother he couldn't screw her anymore. Some complications with the disease. And for years, she just took what she could get from him in that department. Last year, he dumped her for his mistress of 15 years. Julia, honey, is there something I should know? My mother said that it just came out of left field when he told her, but...I knew. You know how? No. His cards. They were always humorous. His birthday, anniversary, holiday... He could pull it off in the moment, but... something tangible, something that my mother could hold in her hands as proof. - I'm gonna take a cab. - Wait. Julia-- I'm fine, all right? Just tell Holt I don't feel well. I'll see him at home. Okay. Shit. - Hey, Terry. - Lucy needs me. I have to go. Hey, can I get something to drink? ...hostage standoff with very little news to report.</i> Television and radio personality Sammy Winter...</i> - Hey, Kenny. - Yeah? Can you go get me a drink? Can you just give me one second? - What'd you say? - We're just finishing up. The drinks are in the fridge. It's right over there. Oh. Okay. No problem. I'll go get the drink. Um... That's a really good one. Use that one. Oh. Uh, Kenny? Wake up, Kenny! Oh, my God! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Oh, my God. He killed Kenny. Okay. You like that? What happened? What happened?" You're the negotiator! What do you think happened? When a gun goes off in a hostage situation, somebody dies! Okay! We are losing the focus here! The focus is me! Me! Okay! I want respect! And I want it now! I got enough explosives strapped to my waist to flatten the whole city block! So back off! You back off! Sammy. What is it that you want? What I want is for these people to listen to me! Don't act like I don't exist! You go on with your lives! I'm here! God damn it! I'm still here! What are you doing? I'm mixing chemicals to throw them in his face. That is insane. - Maybe she's right. - No. You're both hopped up on Spic And Span. Look, trust me on this one. There's nothing we can do. You have been a coward too long. You have outlived your relevance. Look, sit! You want to get your head blown off, that's fine by me. But some of us might like to live to see their next birthday. Why? What will happen then? I said sit, old woman. You're not the captain of this ship. You've proved that. Willa! Wait! That's enough! God damn it! No one pistol whips Johnny Gage. Really, Johnny? 'Cause I just did, bitch. Shoot him! You better freeze, man. Come on, shoot me. Shoot him, God damn it! Shoot me. Come on. Come on. Shoot me. Shoot me, pussy. You pussy! I will, I swear. Shoot! I swear to Christ, I will! Shoot. Do it. Do it, you pussy! You screwed me, Lucy. You screwed me. You were never gonna run the story, were you? Never! Never! Never! - I don't know why I trusted you! - Wait! You kill her, and your story dies. Trust me, I got no other motivation to stop you from shooting - her other than that. - Yeah? No one will give your story justice like Lucy Spiller. Come on. You've come this far. Sammy? Hey. Come on, Sammy. Let me do it. Let me do it. Come on, Sammy. Let me do it. Let her put you on the cover. You can trust me. Come on, Sammy. Let me take care of you. Come on. Okay. Okay. Come on. You do it.Come on, come on. Back to work! Back to work! We're gonna do the magazine! Come on! Let's do it. Let's get back to work. Back to work! We heard shots fired from inside the building. Was anyone injured?</i> We have confirmedone causality, yes. Do you know the identity?</i> Yes, a male employee has been fatally shot, and we're waiting</i> notification of his relatives before we release his name.</i> Normally, in a situation like this, we would advance on the building,</i> but because he has explosive-- It's moving into day three of the standoff,</i> and we're still waiting to see if Sammy Winter will turn himself in--</i> It's beautiful. Beautiful. It's better than I dreamed. We did it. No. You did it. No. This is us. Us. We shouldn't have to work that hard for love. Boom. Move back. We love you, Sammy! I love you! Could you please leave us alone? This is not the time! Holt, come to bed.
