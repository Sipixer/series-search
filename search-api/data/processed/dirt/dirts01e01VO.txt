she look ridiculous. I'M GAY!!! HOLLYWOOD HOOKUP!!! Hey, sweetie. Listen, Jessica wants you to print a retraction. - She's really... - Not now. Ok. So we'll talk about it... Yeah, that's good. Celebulimia?!? Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you. What's that, Harvey? No woman should leave their drink unattended in these troubled times, most of all you. You ever heard of Jatropha Curcas? - Your second wife? - No. It's a poisonous plant that grows in the tropics. Very difficult to detect, flavorless, and it kills in about 15 minutes. Do you have any idea of how many of these people would like to see you laying on the ground begging for somebody to call 911? Damien Fields, less than 20 feet away. You have pictures of him blowing some guy in Griffith Park. At least we shot his good side. Cara Valente. Expose' on her and her nanny. - Manny. - Right. Manny. And that time-lapse series on the hooker parade on and off my yacht. That was very clever. And very funny. It didn't even make the cover. You're hardly Spielberg, Harvey. Certainly not anymore after becoming a punch line in one of your magazines. You know, that divorce cost me two out of my three houses. In Hollywood, that's practically homeless. - You know why I'm not afraid? - Mmh? Because you and all of your Hollywood pals read my magazines and secretly love them. And you know every word is true. And as much as you all hate to admit it, you need me. You're amazing. "Pratically Homeless!" DIRT Special Issue!!!</i> Synchro: Klonni, Andrea Cooper, Ai, _/Yellow Sub\_</b> SynchFix: Metalmarco ::ITA-SA:: & _/Yellow Sub\_ Proudly Presents:</b> Dirt - Season 01 Episode 01 - "Pilot"</b> Prince Tyrese had the floor tonight with 26 points and a triple double. How does it feel? Feels good. Wish they could all go down like that. What are your thoughts going to the playoffs? I'll play good, don't get hurt. Make sure I make it to my kid's parent teacher conference. All right, Tommy. Wise words indeed from tonight's Pontiac MVP, Prince Tyrese. Keep it. Sorry. I'm happily married. I don't care if you're on your deathbed, your mother's on fire, we're at the brink of a nuclear war. I want those photos on my desk tonight. Okay. Give my love to Maria. Okay, everybody, what do you got? We have about a dozen really ugly celeb butt shots. Great. We have Britney? Oh, yes. "Derriere Don'ts". "Booty Boo-Boos"? "Pass the Cottage Cheese." That's good, but it's a little too abstract. This is Dirt Magazine, folks. "Dis-ASS-ter!!!" Okay, what about covers? We have a lead on the mistress in the Pagliaca murder trial. Do you have any confirmation? It's gonna cost us to get her story. What does she look like? Not bad. Slutty. Good. We love slutty. Tell her if she doesn't talk to us, we're gonna run it without her side anyway. Excuse me. - Just make it happen. - Okay. I got $1,500 and I got two envelopes. I need those shots, Don. No problem. Okay, anything on the Blogan bump? Nothing on the blump, but I was chilling with Mary-Kate's trainer's best friend this weekend, and she was saying that she might be going back to rehab. Really? Anything else on that? No, but I thought we could do, like a thing about her struggle with addiction and... Right, her struggle. Um, okay. Listen, there is actual reporting involved in what we do? Our readers want to know that people actually screw up and that they actually sleep with hookers and that they lie, so no "a friend of a friend." That would be gossip, and gossip is what lands you in court. The only real defense we have is the truth, preferably with photos. Never send anything over your TREO you wouldn't want the whole world to see. </i> Duffy, you're fired. McPherson, you've got a week to convince me not to fire you. Duffy, you have five minutes to clean out your desk. Shit. Remember, the people that we're going after every day are not stupid. They've risen to the top one way or another, so we have to be faster, bolder, and smarter than they are. If you think we're behind here, you should see your sister magazine. If anything breaks, I'm reachable. Guys, have fun. Hi, Don. Are you in place?</i> Yes. The housekeeper let me in.</i> I already gave Stormy half the money up front. Okay, great. Tyrese is leaving training right now. - Are you okay? - Huh?</i> - Don? - Yeah. Hmm.</i> I don't know. I'm okay. Don, are you taking your medication?</i> Don, have you been in touch with Dr. Shalbo? Because I cannot go to the pharmacy for you. Okay. Sorry. Can you still do the work? - Yes. - Are you sure?</i> Do you want someone to cover the premiere?</i> No, I got it. Go for Holt McLaren. Make him mad.</i> That's right. Then I'll take over from there. Oh, Prince! Unh! Unh! I think it's your turn now. Hey, Lucy. Want some chili fries? God, no. Did you get Prince Tyrese and the hooker? Yeah. You got everything? I got 'em having sex for two hours, and the coke, and he choked her, and the strap-on. Don, not so loud. Okay. - Julia! - Julia! Johnny! Johnny! Holt, can you step out while we get some pictures of the stars? Holt McLaren? Yeah. You were great in "Another Word for Love". Thanks. I mean really great, like... like stop-the-presses great. Yet somehow the presses keep going, huh? Haven't seen you in the trades lately. Huh? Haven't seen you in the trades lately. I took some time off. You did, like, seven movies in a row, and they all bombed. Yeah, I did. Countdown, Blown Monkey, Pale Assassin, The Growling, Hap Patale, 13 Telling House Lane. That's only six. Get Even: uncredited cameo. Wow, you're creepy, man. You're always great in everything you do. You know, you're authentic. Thanks. Anything coming up? Huh? Anything coming up? Uhm... I'm, like, in talks in this... this cool Fincher movie. It's a great script. We'll see. It sounds pretty vague. Huh? Sounds pretty unlikely, like the movie probably won't happen. Anyway, take care man. - Hey, Holt. Holt. Holt, Holt. - What? They have great chemistry. And he's not very good, but they're good together, you know. They look hot together. - What? - There was a rumor he screwed her on the movie. - What the hell did you say? - Ahh, I don't believe it, but I can find out... d-d-definitively if you wanna know. What are you talking about? That way, maybe you could give me a little piece of gossip, o-or a big one. And that way, I could help you get your career out of the toilet. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Take it easy! That's good work, Don. That's great work. I want to see that footage first. Get out of here. Hey, Holt, why don't you smile, buddy? Yeah, right here, pal. The other day... I was in a fight with this guy. He was being an idiot. He was on the floor, you know.</i> He looks back up at me, and I'm all like, "I know Crumb McGuff, bitch."</i> Guys, right here. Thank you. Beautiful. Oh, hey, Holt. Bummer about that a-hole paparazzi dude. Yeah. - So what's up, man? - Huh? You been workin'? - Um, I'm developing a couple of things. - He's got an independent. Man, you were awesome in "Another Word for Love", one of my all-times. Thanks, man. I thought, damn, this guy's good. I thought I was gonna have to, like, move aside. I'm gonna go sit down. Hey, keep at it. You got mad skills, dawg. Yeah, peace out, bro. Hi. I'm sorry about earlier. That photographer's a nut job. And you give a shit because? I'm Lucy Spiller, Now magazine. I'm a big fan. Right. Listen, uh... I would love to do a feature on you sometime. "The Actor's Actor." "Actor's Actor" huh? Isn't that a nice way of saying "chronically unemployed"? We just have to find the right thing to do together. Or the right reason. Bye. - What an asshole. - Gee, you think? Easy there, Tyson. I... I'm so sorry I ruined your premiere. Oh, are you kidding? You took their minds of the movie, which sucks. Come on, you were great, though. You just love me. Yeah, I guess I do. You can do better than that. Don't you think we've been in the news enough for one night? Come on. You really think anybody in here sees anything but themselves? Plus it's really dark in here. It is... and wet. Make me come. - Great performance. - Thank you. You know, nobody in Hollywood reads. It'd be a stretch to call me "somebody in Hollywood". This whole book, the whole thing happens because a guy dips a cookie in some tea. That's not just any cookie. - It's a Madeleine. - Wow. She's gorgeous and she's read Proust. - Cal. - Lucy. What? I think this is the part where you lose interest because I'm not a player. - I look that shallow? - No, you don't look shallow at all. Well, I might be, just a little. I think we should get a medal for sitting through that movie tonight. - Yeah. - Or something. Definitely something. Uh, that's me. That's me. - You think you can catch me? - If you let me. Hey, buddy, you like that? Huh? You like that, buddy? Sure you do. Come on. There's somebody at the door. Mm-hmm. - Hey, Stormy. - Hey, Don. Come on in. I was just playing a little Hawaiian music for Tristan. - Oh, I hear it. - Yeah, he likes that. Dr. Lucero said the cancer could go away, but it's not very likely. - Cats are nocturnal. - Right. Listen, do you think I can get the rest of my money now? Mm-kay. Here you go. Let go, baby. Let go. Oh, there. You put that strap-on right in his butt. I did. That was great. Here you go. - Thank you. - Okay. Good night. Good night. She was nice, huh? Nice lady. - Kira! - Hi! How are you? Oh, I am so good. - Hi. - How are you? Oh, I'm good. Your skin, it's like glowing. - Really? - Yeah. You getting laid? - I wish. Let me show you around. - Ok. - Oh, hell, I love it. It's so bohemian. - Thank you. Oh, Check it out. This guy gave me some E. "E". How retro. This shit wrecks me. Dude, come on, it's just a fridge. I don't think he can hear you, bro. He's pretty cashed. Holy shit! That's that guy Holt. Holt, uh... - McLaren? - Yeah. That guy from Another Word for Love? He was phenomenal! Yeah, well... What's he been doing since then? Standing in front of this fridge. Hey, what's up, buddy? Stop. Oh, yes... What? What's wrong, honey? What is it? You can talk to me. I'm pregnant. Oh, God. Oh, baby. What? Who? Indie art house loser. Jeff Sagliano. Oh, crap. How? I met him at a retrospective that they were doing at The Egyptian of his films. Can you imagine that retrospective of that shit? I am so totally screwed. Oh, honey, look, you... you can always, you know? No. I am so totally Catholic. I can't. Well, does he know? No. No. Nobody knows. Nobody knows except you. Oh, sweetie. Oh... It's okay. What are you doing? I got to teach a yoga class. Hi. Hi. - This is for you. - What is this? Just our CD, just in case you want to give it a listen. I feel terrible. I didn't get you anything. You're in the studio. You think there's never been a piece of music like it. Mozart and Dylan leap to mind. Then you finish it... and find every reason in the world to hate it. Sounds like fun. Then there's getting people to actually listen to it and maybe even buy it. You have all your press contacts in here. There's photos. Yeah. Nothing like being a desperate musician trying not to appear desperate. How am I doing? Want to make us famous? I never told you what I did for a living. No. Why? You're not, like, CIA, are you? Mm. Wow. You knew the whole time. "Want to make us famous?" Okay, that was just my feeble attempt at humor. - Get out. - What? - Get out. - Lucy... What's going on? I had an amazing time. I'm sure you did. It didn't work. What didn't work? I'm not going anywhere until we sort this out. This is sorted out. Get your shit and go. That's crazy. This is crazy. - Is that a stun gun? - Yeah. Now leave. Lucy, you're not gonna use a stun-- Cats do much better with radiation than humans. How do you know that? Well, for one thing, they have fewer pain sensors. I feel that you could have caught this cancer earlier, Don.</i> I do, too, buddy. Excuse me? Baby, baby, I am so sorry. I mean, what the hell are they are looking for? Look, sweetie, I know. They suck. They are idiots. If we could just get you a little press. You know, I got a call from the "Dancing With the Stars" people. Look, I'm not doing no "Dancing With the Stars" bullshit. Honey, it is a hot, hot show. - What did Fincher say exactly? - I don't know I couldn't get him on the phone. And then J.J. went on this whole rant about how you're not hot, not bankable. All right, all right. Call me later, will you, please? Why did you have guys up Prince Tyrese? Is he the basketball player? Yes, he's the basketball player. Oh, come on. We always have people on him. He's got a squeaky-clean family-man image, and he's a total slime ball. Did you get anything on him? Why, you want him to autograph your balls? No, the son of a bitch loses us every time. Lucy. Lucy. What? You realize Gibson Horne has a 30% interest in the team, right? Shame on you, Brent. As journalists, we're not supposed to cave to corporate interests. Oh, my God. Is that how you get through the night, pretending to be a journalist? No, I take pills. How do you get through the night? Don Konkey, the last pap to shoot on film. Hi, Mr. Barrow. Hey, great job on that Holt and Julia thing. That's terrific stuff. You're a real play-maker, you know. You let me know if you get anything on Prince Tyrese. You're always my first call, Brent. Donny, I love you. Go away! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Shh! Shh! If I'm gonna do this, my name can never be used. Your name means nothing. Thanks, buddy. They wouldn't want to use your name on something like this. Well, they can't, no matter what. Okay. And I want some cash. And I want some kind of good press. I want stories in your magazines... Stories that make it seem like I'm getting offers. I need to have some idea of how big a story you have. It's big. - Well, do we get it exclusively? - You do. And I have to talk to Lucy. For all I know, we already know all about it. You don't. Nobody does. I can't talk right now. They'll want more than just the one story. I got as much as they can handle. How's your big project? I--I'll call you. And you haven't been seeing a therapist. Nope. I'm gonna recommend very strongly, once again, that you see a therapist. You have the money, you have the insurance. - I have a list here. - Okay, if I could just-- You can't treat these drugs like a smorgasbord and just take the ones you feel like taking, Don. Ok, if I could just get the Zeldox, Risperdal, the Zyprexa, and the Ariprazole? Don, you are one of the lucky people who have a form of schizophrenia that's manageable. Most people aren't so fortunate. - I know. - You have to respect the disease and respect the treatment. Ok, I'll respect the disease. But could you give the Zeldox, the Risperdal, the Zyprexa, and the Ariprazole? All right. But I want to see you in three weeks. Thank you. Well, maybe if you don't want your client in the Celebrity Big Asses piece, she should stop her twice-daily trips to KFC or stop calling herself a celebrity. Bye. Good morning, sunshine. - I'm late for a meeting. - This won't take long. Gib asked me to look at some sale-spending ratios, and someone needs a little intervention. Since when do you have anything to do with the editorial budget? Since the owner of the company asked me to. I forgot. Gibson's little warrior. How is the view from deep inside his ass? You know, maybe you should remember who hired you. You just wanted to screw me. Oh, yes. That's right, baby. The whole world was out to screw you. - In one way or another. -  I hired you 'cause you were the one editor out there that was supposed to run two magazines at the same time and make'em twice as successful as they were under two editors. If you want me to run two magazines, give me the freedom to run two magazines. You're overspending! I am busting my ass to make these magazines work! It's amazing how naked ambition makes a person just completely transparent. Really? What do you see? You want my job. I would kill myself if I had your job. - I like to get dirty. - Hmm. Don! Donny! Hey, Dickweed! Donny! Don, i can read your thoughts! Donny! Hey, Donny Little-dick.! I am not. I'm average. All your thoughts are in my mind. </i> Mmm, no! I love you, Donny. I love you, Donny. Kiss me. </i> No. No, not here. I'll scream. I'll scream, Donny. Kiss me. </i> No, no, no. No. Just kiss me. Can I help you? I need the Zeldox, the Risperdal, the Zyprexa, and the Ariprazole. - Okay. Um, it'll be about 45 minutes. - Okay. No! I'm sorry? Back away, Don! </i> Run away! Come on, Don, Run away! Run away, Don! - I think babies are beautiful. - Shut up! I'm totally cool just being the baby daddy. I'm not! I slept with you once, Jeff! So? I sleep with a lot of people once. Right. That's my point. Okay, so say someone else is the baby daddy. Why are you saying it like that for? - Like what? - Like you're P. Diddy or something. God, I cannot believe I ever threw you a bang. Ew. My publicist told me Dirt magazine already knows that you're the baby's daddy because that whore Julia Mallory told them. I hear you, baby. I totally hear you. - You hear me? - Loud and clear, Major Tom. Oh, my God. Honey, you just go on home. You got to take it easy and not get so tweaked. She thinks I told Dirt. She thinks I told the magazine. She says she's never gonna talk to me again. I would never do that. You know I wouldn't. Kira has nobody. God, I am so lucky to have you. Hi. Just take whatever you want, all right? Don't hurt me. That's cute. Well, we're closed, but... You want a drink or just a wall socket to charge your stun gun? You really didn't know who I was, did you? I still don't know who you are. Who the hell are you, and why is it such a goddamn big deal? Anyway, I'm sorry. There it is. Doesn't happen often, but I am. Or even, like, "I'm sorry I tasered your nut sack just when you let your guard down with a woman for the first time since your ex cheated on you." I mean, for example. Wow. That's rough. - Okay, I'm really sorry. - See? It's pretty nice. I'm getting the hang of it. If you want to give it another try... I promise, no weapons this time. Oh. Yep. Here it is. Look. Look. That's killer. Ha ha! Hey, look at this. "Wagging tongues in the rumor mill say Holt has several big movie deals in the works." I wish they'd let me know about 'em. No, no, it doesn't matter. If they say you're hot, you'll be hot. If you say so. Babe, I am so proud of you. * And bring those magazines * * And show me which one's your favorite flaw *</i> Hello. Bullshit. Who is this? Oh, Mr. Fincher. David, right. Yeah, it was--it was just a puff piece, but-- Oh, thank you. To be--To be in your movie? What, are you kidding? Of course. With Kir--Kira Klay? No, I didn't know she was gonna do it. And Clooney.. That's awesome. Thanks. Thank you, thank you. No, no, listen, I'm gonna work my ass off on this part. I'm gonna work my ass off. Thank you. Thank you. * Though I am standing * * I am trembling in my knees * * So whisper prayers over me * * And hold me while I dream * Wait. Hold on. Hello. What? What? Slow down. Okay. Okay, thank you. It's Kira. She OD'd. Hey, Don. What are you doing? Uh, I like little fudgy rolls. Well, you have money. Why don't you just buy some little fudgy rolls? I like 'em from here. You feeling better? Much better. The voices-- Much better. - Oh, good. - Thank you, Lucy. You're a great photographer, Don. You don't owe me anything. Good morning, Mr. Fincher. Could I get something hot to drink? Chamomile tea or something? Thanks. Good morning. Well, I'm sorry I'm late. Um, I don't know what you know. I don't know  what you want to know, um, but I've spent most of the morning on the phone with Kira's manager, who informs me that she's had a medical emergency, and, um, will not be joining our film. This is the least of the new bad news. Apparently, Mr. Clooney can't see anybody else in the role, and... although I don't know... how this is gonna shake out in the next 48 hours, we're all adults, and, um... I think we know how this tends to end up. Have a bagel, and thank you for coming. You can send them in. Now, what can I do for you, besides receiving your undying gratitude for the beautiful profile in my magazine? I'm not gonna give you any more dirt, not about my friends or my enemies. Kira's in the hospital because I told. Kira's in the hospital because she's a drug addict. The point is that you people- Okay, first of all, you're welcome for the profile, plus the three other tidbits that we've managed to place which any publicist would sacrifice a left nut for her. Secondly, you're now a source, and I think we're gonna do wonderful things together me, you, and Don here. I like this office. I'm not gonna help you anymore. - Oh, poor Julia. - No. Don't... Don't even go there. No, when she finds out about your betrayal. Think about it. Poor Julia. I mean, I how how much she adores you. She'll either understand, or she won't. I don't care. I love her and she loves me. - Well, that's brave. - Screw you. Hey, Holt, I think you need to see something. What? You know what we love here at Drrt and Now? - Homemade porn. - So? What's that got to do with me? Have a seat. I love this feeling. I can't focus my eyes, Johnny. It's okay. Let's take this off. I'm not sure, I want to do this.</i> Sure you do. Oh, you're so beautiful. Oh, come on, Johnny. Do you like that? Ah, yeah. I honestly would rather not leak this. I'm an actor. That's all I ever wanted to do. No, you wanted to be famous. There's a big difference. You can give your dirt to Don whenever. Just make sure it comes in regularly. Lucy... Have you ever actually loved anybody? Nah. You've got no one. It's obvious. You've got nothing and no one. - Don, you can go. - Hmm? Go. Hey! Paparazzi piece of shit! It's okay, Tristan. It's o... Okay. It's okay. Hey! Don't fumble! Don't fumble! Don't. Daniel, come around here. Hey, man. You can't read? Private property. What's that? It's business. Well, aren't I part of the business? I said it's just business. Hey, let's go inside. Come on, let's go. You know, I can't smoke this. - Why? - 'Cause it makes me too horny. You like that? Yes. Hello. Hey, Mr. Fincher. David, right. Yeah. Yeah? Really? Oh, that's great news. No. No, I haven't booked anything else. What, are you kidding? Of course I do. Oh, I can't believe Jennifer signed on to do the part. Okay. Yeah, I'll be there. Wow, babe, that's great. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, I heard about what happened to Kira. Wait. What? When? Yeah, she was... she was a really good person. Right. At the memorial. What happened? Kira's dead. Oh, my God. She had a brain bleed. Oh, my God. The movie's back on. I still have the part. Slow down the car. What are you doing? Slow down. Will you talk to me? I'm sorry. Sorry... Pull the car over. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the hell are you doing? Oh, my God! Stop the car! Stop it! Please stop the car! Oh, my God! Stop it! Holt! Stop it, Holt! Oh, my God! Hey, come on. Come here. All right. Come on. We got to get you out of here. Come on. Come on, sweetie, talk to me. Hang in there. Need any help? It's on fire! Keep away! REAL-LIFE ACTION HERO CELEBRITY SUICIDE? Don? He's dead, Lucy. We killed him. No, Don, no. No, Holt is okay. - It's Kira. - Tristan. Tristan is dead. Who's Tristan? Tristan, my cat! Oh, a cat. Jesus, Don... My best friend, and we killed him. We? What are you talking about? All that stuff we did, all the bad things. No, Don, no. Tristan had cancer, remember? We didn't kill him. - We did. - No, Don. We did. No, Don. No, we didn't kill him. * You look so dainty, darlin'. * * Crossin' over the road. * * To where the taxis wait in line. * * You move like violence, darlin'. * * You're stubborn as they get me *. * Every time. * * Your hear beats so quickly. * * I hear it movin' in the... * * Night till the light. * * So sneak on over, darlin'. * * And bring those magazines. * * And show me which one's your favorite flaw. *</i> * 'Cause bad, bad you. * * And bad, bad me. * * Is all we'll be left with. * * Anyway. * * Yes, bad, bad you. * * And bad, bad me. * * Is all we'll be left with. * * Anyway. * An European Cooperation
