- <i>Leave me alone.</i> - You know what you have to do. Don. No, goddamn it! You know you have to kill Lucy. Too much is happening! Too much is happening!</i> - You have to kill her to save her. - <i>It's all coming undone.</i> They still haven't caught Lucy's stalker.</i> Do you know anyone with any kind of mental illness? - Paranoia? Schizophrenia? - No. No one springs to mind. Stop looking at me. Johnny Gage is telling the public that he gave the sex tape of him and Julia to Lucy</i> in exchange for favorable coverage in Drrrt.</i> ...may come back to bite her on the ass.</i> The only other person who has ever even seen this tape</i> is Lucy Spiller at DirtNow. Julia going public about Johnny Gage raping her</i> only to find out that she was using the tape</i> - <i>to get her stalled career going.</i> - Just keep this story on the inside. And... you can own me. - I don't mind being owned. - <i>Oh, poor, poor Julia.</i> This is a great cover. - <i>Willa dumped Barrow...</i> - I can't do this anymore. ...no matter how hard he tried to encourage her to come back.</i> Did I do something wrong? - You know you have to kill Lucy. - <i>Can you just tell me why?</i> Please? Don, I can't take it. I need to hear from you. If I've done something to hurt you, we can talk about it, but you have to call me back. I have a lot of people out ther looking for you. Please-- Donald, you have been given a sacred task. Don't turn you back on God.</i> Why are you doing this to me? She's my friend. - <i>Kill her Donny.</i> - Tristan! Ivane eam, Don, et desine eius dolorem.</i> Ita missa est. Ita missa est. - <i>The mass is over? - That's right, Donald.</i> The mass is over. It is time. So every second of my private life on camera, and we can't find a frame of this jerk? Someone knew enough to cut the power in the right place, - take out the cameras. - That's reassuring. Have you heard from your friend Don yet? It's not Don. He's schizophrenic. And he's the perfect stalking machine. The surveillance, the photography, all the methodologies-- Okay, so find out. Just find him first. He's never disappeared for this long before. If I have to choose between this asshole who's stalking me and Don, - I say find Don. - Your car is here. Oh, great. As if my life isn't absurd enough, now I have to go to a fake fashion show. Look, America is shitting itself for the Best New Model finale. Get me a photo of America shitting itself, and I'll put that on the cover. Bet if I chopped off one of their heads, you'd put it on the cover. I just might. Maybe I should pitch the cover to Tina Harrod. I'm sure it's just the kind of pap Tina's magazine would gobble up. Of course, they only have two-thirds the circulation of DirtNow. But I wasn't talking about her magazine. I heard she's taking over yours. Call 911! Terry, pull the cover. She's not breathing! Synchro : ITA-SA & YST Transcript : swsub.com Dirt - Season 01 Episode 13 "Ita Missa Est" Easy there, Don. - That's a close call, buddy. - Sorry. No, it's cool. What are you doing in my car? You're not even real. You really feel qualified to make that judgment, Don? Are you? Please, just tell me who sent you here. Who sent me? You don't know? You've been chosen. You don't have a choice. This one's not about free will. Schopenhauer's got nothing to do with this shit, Don. This is His will. That's right. With fear and trembling, find your salvation. You're gonna do it, right, buddy? You're gonna kill this bitch, right? Okay, let's go with the family angle and do a box on the anorexia. Family's gone radio silent. All no comment. Really? Oh, my God, somebody said no? Well, let's all go home. What other photos do you have? I have all the publicity crap, a few candids, and some frame grabs. Okay, you need to get more. Let's get a shooter inside the funeral. - What about Don Konkey? - Don Konkey is my contact. I'll deal with Don Konkey. Track the autopsy. She was anorexic. I mean, her liver probably-- Probably? Until you can show me your doctorate, maybe you should just flash your tits to the coroner and find out for sure. Lucy. I just heard from my source at Vanity Fair. Holt McLaren is giving them an exclusive. Son of a bitch. - Excuse me. - Hi. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah, sure. Wanna go in my office? That's... no. No, I wanted to-- I wanted to ask you if you know what the temperature is around here for me with Lucy. I've been in the doghouse for a while, and I just-- I thought you were wondering about-- Nah, never mind. Oh, no. I'm sorry. Well, actually, you and I had a pretty clear arrangement. I mean, since you're on the editorial side of things and I'm the publisher, we agreed not to talk shop. Right. Right. No, I'm-- You're absolutely right. I crossed the line. But I'm willing to make a trade. Okay, I think. I'll tell you about Lucy. You tell me about us. - What about us? - You tell me. About us. Tonight, for example. You first. I wouldn't worry about what Lucy Spiller's thinking about you. Her numbers are down four weeks in a row. She's got much bigger things to worry about than you. Like Tina Harrod. Your turn. I'm 23. You're not. All right, there are literally a million 40-year-old women in Los Angeles who would gladly go out with you. So just... grow up, Brent. Holt, come on. How many times can I say I'm sorry? I'm done. Baby... Holt, please. Come on. Come here, baby. Look, it's me. - It's me. - Yeah, and who the hell is that? Is that the Julia that was so terrified to go into public because the tape was out there? Or the Julia who released the tape to amp up her own career? Okay, look, I'm sorry. Okay? I don't know. I don't know any of the answers, if I ever did. You sat right here in this bed and looked in my eyes as we destroyed that tape. And you kept a secret copy, Julia? A goddamned secret! So what? So what? So you could give your career a jump-start! - Have you ever been so scared? - Scared of what? Everything. I mean, so much so that you lose your way and you do things that even while you-- you don't know yourself, so you close your eyes, and you cut a deal with a part of yourself that you didn't even know existed. Listen to me. Listen to me! Stay the hell  away from me. Do you understand me? - Do you understand me? - No! Stay the hell away from me. You need somebody to talk to, why don't you call Johnny Gage? Gah, I mean, there's even  a secret blog of disgruntled Lucy Spiller employees. Password protected. Yeah, it's D-B-A-G, if you're interested. Yeah, it would be pretty bad  if any of that shit got leaked. Rumor has it that Gibson is in talks with Tina Harrod. Okay. Just get it done. I gotta go. Don. Thank God you're here. Sorry, Lucy. You're sorry? Honey, I'm so glad to see you. - Mass is over. - What? What mass? Don... you're really freaking me out. No! No, I won't! No, no! No, I won't! They want me to kill my best friend, but-- Go to hell! Don! Hey. Kira! They want me to kill my best friend. They want me to kill her, but I wouldn't do it. I won't do it. It's okay. It's okay. It's going to be all right. Let's get back into your car, drive to her office. Okay? But on the way, maybe we'll stop at Panda Express and get some of those egg rolls that you love so much. And then slit the bitch's throat. I missed you. No. Don. Don, we never do what I want to do. Don! Don! Don, you're gonna die out there if you don't go back and kill her. I know. Don! My friend called me as soon as it went up. Goddamn bloggers. - I'm sure it's all bullshit. - Where's Brent Barrow? Lucy! - This isn't exactly-- - Shut up, Brent. Hi, sweetie! Tina. Oh, do you two, um-- Do you two know each other? Yeah, we do. Yeah, we were stringers together at the Post when we got out of college. What are you doing here? - Uh, well, we were just-- - We were-- Is it "Bring a jackal to work" day? Thank God, Lucy. You haven't changed. Tina and I were on the MPA panel together for the national magazine conference. Yes. Would you please put those big guns down and give a girl a hug? Okay, that's great. Oh, my God, look at you. Brent, how do you not jump this girl's bones every day of the week? I mean, you are just gorgeous. So they didn't renew your contract at Celebrity Suck-up? Oh, honey, I set my sights way higher thanDirtNow. And yet here you are. - Yeah, well-- - Did they offer you my job? Yes or no. Even if they did, I wouldn't take it. Hon, I just had another baby. I'd like to have a lighter schedule, I'd like to have something that gets me home by 6. Oh, please. You'd sell that little newborn for a shot at my desk and we both know it. Well, you know what? If she doesn't stop crying through the night, I may just take you up on that. Come on, walk me around. - I'll talk to you later. - Mm-hmm. Bye. I love this place. Look at the energy in here. Excuse me, Tina? - I don't know if  you remember me. - Terry! Are you kidding? You were my favorite intern ever. Oh, you know, Lisa told me-- - Yeah. - You are! - How far along? - You're pregnant? Yeah. I told you I was gonna need maternity. - Oh, that's right. - You know what? Take longer than you think you need. - So good to see you. - Me too. - Oh, congratulations. - Thank you. Sweetheart. She's a gem. I think you'd better hold on to her. - I will. - All right, sweetie. I know that you're real busy, so-- See ya later. Um, Lucy. So, my contact at the coroner's office wouldn't leak a copy of the autopsy, but I got the highlights. Which are? She had enough Dexfenfluramine in her system to put Weight Watchers out of business. Oh, wow. So a model on an illegal weight-loss drug? Shocking. Find out who gave it to her. Maybe that's a story. - This is your last chance. Friday. - Okay, no bullshit. Is Gibson floating my job out to Tina Harrod? Jesus Christ, Lucy, what is it gonna take to get you to knock? Blow me. - Deal. - Yeah, right. Save it for the next intern. Look, your job is not in jeopardy, okay? Yes, your numbers are down, and the whole Johnny Gage thing doesn't help. But, like I said, Tina and I are-- On the full of shit committee, I got it. My God, why do I bother? You're not gonna listen to a word I say, anyway. - All right. - Hey, don't forget our deal. Brent, you would have a better shot at getting struck by lightning twice while holding a winning lottery ticket. Hi. What's up? Thanks to the Lojack you had installed for your friend's walkabouts, - we have the car. - What about Don? Just the car. It's at the edge of Joshua Tree near 29 Palms. What are they doing to find him? It's a very big place. It's too windy to track his footprints. - Helicopter. - The park service chopper is - busy with another rescue. - What are you saying, Gareth? I'm not exactly in the search and rescue-- I don't give a shit what your exact job description is, and I don't care  what you think of him. Don Konkey is my friend. Find me a goddamn helicopter. I'm here to set the record straight. Yes, I did release the video of me and Johnny Gage on the Internet. And all I can say is I wasn't thinking clearly. But the facts of what happened that night haven't changed. Johnny Gage did rape me. And in my fear and confusion, I thought I could turn a horrible trauma into something positive and I know now how wrong that was, and I'm here to apologize. Julia, last time you were here, you talked about the shame you felt at having been raped. Yes, I did, and I still feel that way. Not so ashamed that it stopped you from figuring out how to profit - from the experience. - No, I-- I wasn't trying to profit from it. I was trying to  take control back. When you're a victim of a crime like rape, there is a sense of helplessness and loss-- So you blatantly lied to your fans, to the people who told you their accounts, to people who trusted you and derived strength and hope from your story? I couldn't control the transgression, so at least I wanted to control the release. That's what Grandma Ruth back in Lubbock used to call a $2.00 lie. It doesn't make any sense. No matter what you call it, it's still a lie, right? I'm just afraid I'm never gonna see him alive again. Of course you are. I never tell him what a good friend he is to me. He really is my friend. No, no, no, I can't! You can't just say I'm a messenger and then, you know, if I-- They can do what they want, you daft bastard. Who are they? The forces. The ones who control you. No, I'm sick. You're sick. I'm sick. We're all sick. The forces that told you to kill her, they're gonna make you kill yourself, now. You don't have to die, Don. Donnie. Please, Donnie. Can we kill Lucy? And then we can go back to our place and make love. It's been too long. I can't, Kira. But then you'll die. The dead slut has a point. Don't waste your breath on them. Can't you see he's knackered? Here's a bit of science for you, Donnie, on your way out. The forces... The forces that want  you to kill yourself, that want you to kill her, they're you. The phone calls are coming from inside the house, mate. All you need to do now, mate, is drag this kindly old blade across your cowardly old throat then peace. It's the only way. I can't kill Lucy. Well, hurry up. It's freezing, hey, will ya? Isn't it, Kira? Ping ping. Tristan? - Hello? - He's alive. He's in the hospital in Palm Desert. The chopper you hired found him in the park.</i> He's dehydrated and a little confused, but</i> he'll be fine. Okay, great. I'll-- I'll get in my car-- He's being airlifted to Cedars first thing in the morning.</i> Get some rest. He's okay. Thank you. - Yes? - Hi, it's Tina. Did I wake you? No Tina. I'm not sleeping. Um, honey, listen. Do you rember that Jay Kim from the Times? Well, he called and he wants me to comment</i> on this rumor that's going around that I'm going to be taking over at DirtNow. I can't wait to hear what you said. Well, I said I love the magazine, but that, you know, severed heads and sex issues, uh, it's just not my wheelhouse. I leave the dirt up to my old friend, Lucy.</i> Your old friend? Yeah, you know what? Can we just please-- clear the air and just get rid of all these bullshit rumors and just-- you know, let's just have lunch. Can we have lunch tomorrow at the Ivy? The Ivy? That's a nice scene-setter for the Times. You want to have lunch, let's do it at my office. - 1:00 tomorrow. - Great. I'll pick it up. - No, I'll have it catered. - Okay. Fantastic. Oh, remember, I only like veggies. I don't eat anything with a face. Since when? I'm really excited. Okay, good. I can't wait to see that famous vault. Okay. Bye. Good-bye, Lucy. Hi, Don. Lucy? You're all right. Yes. Yes, sweetie, I'm right here. I'm right here. The doctor says you're gonna be fine. I didn't kill you. No, baby, you didn't kill me. Honey, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. So glad you're all right. Lucy? Do you need something? What? I'm gonna start-- start taking my monthly injections so I'm never off my meds ever again. That's great news, Don. And, um... I'm gonna sign over my medical power of attorney to you. Why don't we talk about that when you're feeling better? I can't trust myself when I'm really, really sick. I trust you. Promise me you'll do whatever you have to do, even if that means putting me somewhere. Don, no one is ever gonna put you anywhere. Promise me. I promise you. Thank you, Lucy. You get some rest. Yeah, you, um-- Call me if you need me, right? Of course. "...I'm so sorry that I wasn't there for you." And I said, "So did you have a nice little funeral in the backyard?" And she goes, "Mom, it's a pigeon. I threw it in the trash." - She reminds me so much of you. - Get her a good therapist. I already have. I'm telling you, Lucy, you've gotta get a kid. You would be such a good mom. Well, that's a whole new twist on sucking your fingers. You know, you can play that tough girl all you want, but I know you. I also know you, so let's put away these little baby pictures and tell me what the hell were you doing in Brent's office? Oh, God. Lucy, honey, if I was actually vying for your job, do you think that I would just walk into the offices of DirtNow and have a meeting with your publisher? Well, I don't know, Tina. Would you? Wow, you really just don't trust anybody, do you? You do have to trust somebody, sweetie. This is no way to live. You don't have to be alone. Who says I'm alone? Okay, I don't know. Great! Who is he? - Or, you know, or who is she? - Oh, God. What? What happened between you and I was a one-time thing. Yeah, okay. It was actually four. But who's counting? Please, come on. Who's the hero? Let me know. Do I know him? - No comment. - Really? Is he famous? Married? Married and famous? All right, doesn't matter. I don't care. I don't care. I'm just glad that you're happy. - And I'm really glad that we did this. - I am, too. This is nice. Honey, I'm serious. I don't want any more bad blood between us. I really don't. Not until the music stops and you make a run for my chair. Honey, life is not a battle. You have got to stop looking for the enemy. You're gonna get what you ask for. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, cause when I was eight, I asked for a pony. Sorry. But I'll tell you this: - you got a really big heart. - Thank you. And I wish you'd let it show a little bit more. I really do, and I'm telling you, I promise, I am not-- I'm not after your job. Well, I'll believe it when I see it. Well, I'd put it in writing if I thought that'd make a difference. But, I know that that won't, so... Thank you for lunch. You can't just go to Vanity Fair. It doesn't work like that. You've gotta be kidding me. Lucy, it's a profile. - There's no scandal attached to it. - Okay, well, let me do your profile. - On the cover? - Yeah. Life after Julia. Your new found fame. Your childhood. I, uh-- Our readers want more than just nanny blowjob stories. Well, why don't you talk to Steven, my publicity now, all right? Wait. - Are you having hurt feelings? - Why would I be having hurt feelings? Because maybe you thought I wanted to see you for another reason? Well, did you? Did you? I actually did call just for the article. Your publicist won't talk to DirtNow. So you didn't call me, you had me meet you? Nice try, Lucy. It's okay, you know? - What? - That you want me. You think the whole world revolves around you and your glorious cock. You're such a goddamn narcissist. Yeah? And what does that make you? A narcissist lover? - Do you think I love you, Holt? - Well, do you? I might have, um... - I think I might have fallen-- - God damn it, you were followed. Oh, shit. Put your seatbelt on. What the hellare you doing? Given both our situations, we're a story. - Yeah? How do you figure? - I'd run it. We're gonna start with the Fincher premiere. You're gonna get really cozy and personal. - What? - Your cover story. I'm multitasking. Shit. Oh, God. My God, that guy really wants the shot. Whoa, holy shit, Lucy! It's not like they have guns! Yeah, it's worse. He has cameras. It's okay. Hold on. Okay. Get out. - What? - I'll call you later. How am I supposed to get back to my car? You're a movie star with your very own cell phone. Figure it out. Come here. - What? - We have your stalker. - Where? - Your house. Oh, my God. Okay, arrest him and get him out of there. It's more complicated. You need to get over here. Why? Who is it? Gareth? Shit. Okay, tell me who it is. I'm sorry, Lucy. Don't tell me that it's Don, because-- I can't take it. It's not him. We found the images he sent you on his computer. Leo? It was me, Lucy. Don't arrest him, but just get him away from me. Lucy. What on Earth could you possibly have to say to me? After what happened with Jack Dawson, I was so hurt, and so angry, and I couldn't get you to see what you were doing to people. To me. To yourself. I wanted you to feel the same terror and helplessness as your victims. My victims? - Oh, Jesus, Leo. - I'm sorry, Lucy. - It went too far. - You think? You think maybe it went just a little too far? You think maybe you were just projecting a little bit of your anger about Dad? Or at your pathetic family? Or at your own life? At your sexual indecision? Or your endless quest for God or peace? You're a goddamn idiot. You terrorized the one person who loves you unconditionally because you're uncomfortable with her career. Way to go. Before I walked out, I was standing on a chair in my living room with a noose around my neck. I was ready, Lucy. I was gonna be just like him. No note, no explanation. No real attachments. So the best-- that I could do was to try to reach out to my sister to try to put a dent in her perfect little system of justification and denial. I was trying to reach you because I love you, and I can't just sit by and watch you slip away like he did. I'm sorry, Lucy. - Lucy. - What? I did it for you. The pharmacist has you on speed dial. Well, when you're a celebrity, all kinds of whack jobs get your number. Oh, I'll say. But I got his phone records, and you and this whack job go way back. 42 phone calls from November 12th to the 20th, the longest being 35 minutes. And-- then there is the question of the credit cards to pay for the drugs. You got your story. What do you need me for? I wouldn't want to be responsible for taking down - your dazzlingly mediocre show. - Is that right? Could be. And what does Lucy get out of the deal? Lucy gets nothing. Willa, however, takes this little tidbit and puts it in her own personal vault, and owns you and your first of many favors to come is exclusive access to Lexus Falk family-- - I don't know if I can deliver that. - You can and you will. Any gossip in the fashion world, any supermodel bullshit, any anything comes to me. Your mother must be proud. Yours, too, what with the drug deaths, and all. Lucy, we have the family on the model story. I thought it was a shut-out. I guess we got lucky. Nice work, McPherson. Lock it up. Honey, I promise. I'm leaving in five minutes. - Tina, it's Lucy. - Oh, hi. I thought you were my other half. What's up? I see you signed your contract. That's right. Tina is off the market. But hey, I gotta tell you, that rumor really-- Nicely played. I just wanted to wish you well. Aw, right back at ya, sweetie. Hey, listen, let's keep in touch, okay? Why don't you come over for dinner, see the baby? Again with the baby? I'd like that. Okay, great. All right, honey, I've gotta run, though, okay? - You take care of yourself. - You, too. - Bye. - Okay, bye-bye. I'm so sorry about that. Do you want something to drink? Like a water or soda? - You can't have wine, right? - Um, right. All right, well, let's get one thing straight. You're my hero. You really are, and I mean that. What you have been through since Kira's death, I-- I just can't imagine. Um, you said on the phone you might be able to do an article? Yeah. You mean, to repair the damage of the sex tape? All that? You're just trying to keep your career afloat. That Lucy Spiller, she had no right. No right. Come on! You know what? You just got caught in Lucy's celebrity dollhouse. You didn't do anything wrong. Your boyfriend was her source. None of this press is your fault, so please, just know that. You really have to know that. Her source? Holt? - Oh, I know. - No, I know him. He would never be a source. Okay. Well, you know what, I really, uh-- I really did not want to have to show you this. But I think it's better that you see it now, you know, from me, than, um-- He was-- he was more than her source. I'm so sorry, sweetie. You ready? You know it's intense out there. All right. Lumina, Lucy Spiller. Tell my brother that I'm putting his shit in the driveway, and if it's not gone by morning, I'm giving it to the gardeners. Hi, Lucy. Julia, what are you doing here? You ruined my life. I'm sorry. I was thinking about that article you wrote. It was actually pretty good. But I have some cuts. - Hello? - Don... I need you to get to my house right away. Don't call 911 until after you get the pictures. Okay. Lucy? It's okay, Lucy. Help is on its way. You're going to be okay. I didn't do this! It was the forces. I didn't do this! I didn't do this! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
