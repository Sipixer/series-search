congratulate you. What, is this an interview? How was Holt... on the phone just now? How do you know I was talking to Holt? Body language. I wasn't doing anything. Okay. How are you feeling today, Don? Weird. Weird how? 'Cause I'm starting to feel normal. Well, we'll keep an eye on those feelings of normalcy. Lucy, should I just be following you? That one's yours. - Excuse me. That is my desk. - I know. And you're here to convince me to buy your magazine, but I must know. What's in it for Brent Barrow? May I? Your buzzards and my buzzards should have the principles hammered out by the end of the week. I insist we celebrate. Ciao. You are watching the stars like they're animals in a zoo. You don't have to work tonight, Lucy. You're a studio executive. If you're working, I'm working. Look at these people. If there was any more ass kissing, they'd be serving ChapStick with the champagne. And I didn't invite you here for a story, either. - Really? - Really. I wanted to see you. At your studio's party. So I wanted to impress you. My divorce is final as of Friday. Starlets beware. Actually, I was thinking of gorgeous, smart, successful magazine editors. I'll try to introduce you to some. Come on. You and I had something. Maybe the timing was off, but... That's it... the timing. Right. So, who is Dark Guardian? - What do I get if I tell you? - Depends on how good it is. It's really good. Why don't you take a look over my shoulder? Black blazer, right by the bar. Paul Trisko? Our biggest TV cop is about to become Ã©our biggest movie star. Looks like it might just be my night tonight. That's a pretty good cover, but the night's still young. O'Connor. God. What a prick. You really like sleeping alone? Get a picture of Paul Trisko next to that poster. That Ted Rothman, he likes you. Hi. - How are you? - Good. - Nice to see you. - It's good to see you. Lucy, this is Jasmine Ford. Jasmine, this is Lucy Spiller. - We've met. How are you? - Great, thank you. Lucy covered me taking care of my mom after her heart attack. I wish I could say it was totally altruistic, but she was up for Academy Award. How are you, Holt? Good. Good. You know, we just started rehearsing on Fear Tactic, so... I think you guys are gonna be good together. How about a cover? Me and Holt? I don't know. Make something up, like we're the hottest couple in town. I'll think about it. If my publicist gives you any problem, Just call me directly. Holt, Darren Aronofsky. I have to say hi. Good to see you, Lucy. You, too. Ted Rothman is staring at you. I told you he likes you. - It's so good to see you, Lucy. - It's good to see you, Ted. I gotta take this. Rothman. Maybe we are meant to be together. What's going on? Are you shitting me? All right. You shouldn't be calling me. This one goes way higher up the pay grade. I don't even wanna know about this. Don't even say another word. Honestly, just handle it. Did you miss me? So much. Transcript: swsub.com Synchro: _/Yellow Sub\_ Synchro: ::ITASA:: Season 2 Episode 4 Ties That (Don't) Bind Cellulite, plastic surgery, hero pets, those are not covers. - It's been a slow week. - Not in Hollywood, it wasn't. Dark Guardian's being played by Paul Trisko. - Are you serious? - Wait. Paul Trisko... He's the guy on... Do you watch TV? He's a cop. The show is called The Precinct. - They're releasing his name next week. - So we run it this week. No, no. - We gotta get the costume. - What? Huh? Maybe I'm slightly a comic book nut, but it's not just about the actor. It's what he wears. Every boy in the world wants to see it. Someone's got news judgment. Where is the costume? It won't be at the studio. They'll be making it in secret. I'll get Don on it. - Hey, McPherson. - Yeah. Did you have that call traced? It's a tape library for the TV show Snare a Cyber Predator. Child molester's TV. I like it. So who made this mysterious phone call last night? Someone who stays out of the story. I just don't get it. They talk to little kids online. Don't these morons ever think that they could be talking to a cop or, like, a TV show? Apparently not. Find out what that call was about. The Cyber Predator blogs are hot. - Excuse me? - The TV show... Snare a Cyber Predator. Blogs are full of rumors. You know, one of them said they went online with a staffer posing as 18, but on the air, said she was 15. How do you know about my story? In fairness to me, you really should minimize your browser. - I did minimize it. - Excuse me. - You wanna horn in on this. - You're right. I'm sorry. I was gonna say I have a friend who works at the show, But you know what? It's your story. - Farber. - What? Look, I know that you're eerily good at it, but don't play stupid. - Who is he? - College roommate. Oh, God. All right. On the byline my name goes first. - Call him. - You know what? - I'm not sure I wanna exploit him. - "Exploit"? He's performing a public service by exposing hypocrisy in the news business. - Do you believe your own bullshit? - No. My girlfriend dumped me. She says I write garbage for a living. Are we sharing now? The reason that Liz dumped you is because you work too many nights. In my defense, all the women I've slept with say I give them multiple orgasms. Okay, well, as far as non sequiturs go, not bad. - Who are you calling? - A studio security guy. I've been slipping him cash and premiere tickets for a year. Hey! How'd you like that Radiohead concert? Hey, sweetie! Look gorgeous. How you doin'? You know what? I'm not supposed to tell you this, but... you know the shoes that you wanted the other day? Mom's probably gonna buy them for you for your next... You little shit! Who do you work for? - Stay away from me! - I'm sorry, Mr. Trisko. - I'm not stalking you. - Listen to me. You follow me one more time, I'm gonna put your ass in a car accident. You'll end up dead. You understand me? You understand me? Excuse me, sir. You're frightening your daughter. Goddamn it! Damn it. The man who comes to the door thinks</i> he's meeting a 13-year-old girl for sex.</i> Here he comes now. Hi, Richard. I'm Jonathan. Come on over here. - <i>Let's have a little chat.</i> - He's creepy. What do you have in the bag? Do you have some condoms? It says in your chat transcript that you'd bring some condoms.</i> You're wondering who I am. Have you ever seen a television show - What? - <i>called to Snare a Cyber Predator?</i> General counsel for everything. Thank you. Progress? I got a list from the studio security of everybody who showed up after you got the call. - That call didn't happen. - Right. It's a total of five people. McPherson, sharing a story? If I didn't have Human Resources breathing down my neck, I'd say you're blowing him. - Who are the five? - I got Jonathan Chubb's manager, an agent and a staff lawyer, and she got... General counsel for the entire studio and the head of the studio. O'Connor? Farber's college roommate works there, but Farber's feeling a little bit guilty - about using him. - That is absolutely not true. It's a good thing. Thank you. I appreciate that... making me look like a total asshole. You're welcome. Holt! Holt! Jasmine! Jasmine! Are you two a couple? We're not here to talk about ourselves. We're here to support Green Earth, a cause we both strongly believe in. Holt, do you think the Jews run Hollywood? What? What are you talking about? - Man, come on. - The Jews. You know, your dad. Do you agree with his opinions? It's never been my belief. You know, it never has. I don't think any one group runs Hollywood, Whatever the hell that means. We're here for a good cause, so we need to get inside.</i> Holt McLaren facing tough questions at the Green Earth charity event.</i> The actor's father appeared on a Los Angeles talk show</i> announcing his new book God is White.</i> I truly believe Hollywood's bad for our country.</i> It's eating away at our morals, and everybody knows it's run by homosexuals and liberals</i> and other elements. Now, my son is a fine actor, but I believe he's afraid to talk about what's right. Get the father in for an interview, and call Holt's publicist as a courtesy. What's that look on your face? Are you grinning? We got two great stories, and Holt's dad's a Nazi. I mean, what could be better? You dudes from Dirt... First Farber, now you. I looked you up. You're schizophrenic. You ran naked across your college quad screaming, "I am a tomato." I'm thinking, if you had a head of lettuce, you could've been a salad. That's not funny. - And it's not true. - Sorry. Medical records are supposed to be private. Not to employment agencies, Don. I am the peeping eyes of corporate America. Plus you got yourself a double standard. You don't want me to snoop on you, but you want me to do it on other people. Hypocritical? Maybe? Little bit? Yeah. You're right. I need a wardrobe personnel at Sunset Tower Studios. Okay. Okay, here's one. Gambling problem, massively in debt. No. - Ooh, crackhead. - No. Well... Sick child. Well, that sounds good. Karpova, Anna, seamstress at Sunset Tower Studios. Uh, kid's got some crazy rare form of cancer. Insurance doesn't cover everything. My cat had cancer. - Kitten? - Cat. - Anna? - Who are you? - Do I know you? - I'm Don Konkey. Your son's name is Martin. He has cancer. - He needs surgery. You need money. - How do you know what my son has? I'm sorry. I read a file. I need to know where they make the Dark Guardian costume. - The movie costume? - I'll give you a lot of money. - Why would you pay for that? - I don't know. People wanna know things. - God will punish me for that. - No. It's in the Bible. "Money answereth all things," Ecclesiastes 10:19. "We have money for what we want." "We cannot tell who put it in our hands," Genesis 43:22. "We may spend the money for whatever our hearts desire" " in the presence of the Lord and rejoice," Deuteronomy 14:26. - Are you crazy? - Yeah, but that's not important. Miracles aren't mystery. We see the hand of God. He wants us to. Twenty thousand for the Dark Guardian. I don't know. Mr. Petrelli's office just called. He's the new owner. He wants to meet you tomorrow at his hotel for lunch. You do have the lunch with your mother, though. Cancel my mother. Hey, Farber, did you call your friend at Cyber Predator? Yeah, I called him. I'm having dinner with him. All right. It's not exploitation, it's journalism. Hey, Don. Oh, my God. These are great. Wow. Could Charlie possibly look any worse? Look at that dress. I mean, are you kidding? I couldn't give that away at a yard sale. I bought it for her as a gift. I said cover her, not marry her. She's lonely. Well, we're all lonely, Don. It's the human condition. Look, I know it's hard for you to think of her as another person. No, I just don't want to see you get hurt, honey. You know, we all get hurt, Lucy. It's the human condition. I need 20,000. - Twenty thousand? - Yeah. God wants her to have the money. - Who, Don? - Anna. She's my contact. God's not talking to you directly, right? You're not hearing voices? No. Don't worry, Lucy. I'm fine. 'Cos if your medicine's not working, you know you have to tell me. God is not talking to me. But he did ask for 20 grand? - Yeah. - All right. I'll get the shot, though. Hey. What the hell is this about? I turn on the TV and find out you promised him a cover? - Are you trying to make this worse? - We didn't promise a cover. But do you want this getting out to the competion? Because it will, and you'll be Photoshopped with a swastika in front of you. Be great for your career. You're kidding me, right? He... He's here. I'm gonna talk to him. Oh, God. - The whole general... - Hey, Pop. Well, hey, son! You're looking good. Glad you got rid of that earring. Made you look like a faggot. Here we go with the "faggot" thing again, huh? What do you want? What any father wants... to protect my child. We could talk if you'd answer the phone when your old man calls. Holt, let him do the interview. You let all these people tell you what to do. You know who really runs Hollywood, Holt. - For God sakes, why don't you... - "For God"... That's smart. That's a laugh. You save your spine for special occasions? Pull it out when your old man's in town? - My old man? - Yeah. You're not my old man. You're just some guy who cruised in and out of our lives when everyone was sick of you hanging around. Holt, come on. Let's go. Oh, can you give us a second here? Okay. What do you want? Huh? How much is it gonna take? I don't want your Hollywood money. You know what I'd do with it? I'd drink it, and then I'd piss it out when I'm done. Go home. I got something to say, and I'm gonna say it. People wanna hear my brand of truth. Well, I don't, all right? - Guy's a sociopath. Scares me to death. - Can I talk to Lucy? Alone, please? Oh, I don't know if that's a good idea. Please? Come on. All right. I'll get the car. - You don't have to use this. - Doesn't matter. He'll talk to whoever will listen. I spent all this time hating him, and it did me no good. I do it again, and I'm gonna let him ruin everything I have now. - That's how it works. - Yeah. The opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference. And I'm beginning to understand that, so... You know I'm on your side. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. I mean, I don't want to, uh, pressure you or anything like that. So, you're buying me an expensive dinner to find out what happened on Cyber Predator. Is this gesture, like, totally guilt motivated? Basically, yeah. I mean, It's bad enough you're a gimp, but to take advantage of our friendship... That is worth one expensive dinner. Oh, absolutely. You know, we prefer the term "handicapped." - Oh. - FYI. Thank you. I just don't want you to lose your job. Oh, they won't fire me. It's bad publicity. Plus I fill, like, three quotas. So, you went to J school to work - for Dirt Now, huh? - Yeah. You know, you went to film school to work on a TV show about perverts. We're living the dream, aren't we? Look, what's going on over there? A tape's missing... from a show done out in Panorama City. Some editor asked where it is, the place fills up with lawyers. You have any idea what's on the tape? I know a girl who is an assistant production manager who might. - Well, can you call her for me? - How much you gonna pay her? "Pay"? Money. You guys pay, right? It depends on what she has. The head of the studio showed up. Well, then I'll ask about the money. Could we do this kind of soon maybe? She gets off around 9:00. We could meet up, say, 10:00. And you're not gonna get in trouble for this? Don't worry. We'll leave me out of it. These people better show up. When Lucy smells a story and doesn't get it, she can be such a prick. Tell me about it. She's also the best in the business, so, you know, maybe a little bit of respect is due. I'm sorry. I was addressing the other side of your mouth. Here they come. Hi, guys. Tyler Beckman, Willa McPherson. Becky Walters. - So, Becky, what do you know? - Well, what do you know? - Missing tape. - Ah, yes, yes, yes. Missing and probably shredded, burned and buried, but I might be able to get my hands on a copy. How much? Well, I heard you paid 300 grand for some stupid wedding pictures. I get half a million. To tell you the truth, I'd almost tell you for nothing. I'm so sick of these dickheads. But I won't. What you get rocks. What you get is the biggest story since Monica Lewinsky skimped on her dry cleaning bill... when I get the cash. Well, we're not authorized to spend that kind of money, let me just make a phone call. I hear from you by 12 tomorrow, or I open the bidding. - Well, if you'd just wait a second... - Honey, next time come prepared. Oh, and Tyler gets a quarter mill. A sort of finder's fee. Let's go. I thought you wanted to be kept out of this. For a quarter mill I can be in. I'm thinking about pimping my ride. Let's go! Are you out of your goddamn minds? You let them walk away? - They wanted 750. - What did you want us to do? Call me! She wouldn't give us time, okay? It was a negotiating tactic. Then tell them anything, that money is no problem. You don't ever risk them going to the competion! Come on, McPherson. You know better than that. I'm sorry. I'm pissed that you screwed up, but I'm even more pissed off that you're such a chickenshit you couldn't call and tell me. Oh, hey, Lucy, this just came in. Holt McLaren at a white supremacy rally when he was a teenager. Call his publicist. Tell her I want to do an interview. I'll do it myself. This'll be good, man. Tell wardrobe I'm gonna be a little late. I need to do an interview, all right? Thanks, man. - Hey, there. - We defended you on our web site. Oh my God, you gotta be kidding me! Obviously my father sent this to you, right? Is there anything else you wanna tell me? Campaign donations, an uncle who shot a civil rights leader? Come on. Let's go in here. - So what is it that you want, Lucy? - Not to be made a fool of. Come on. That's bullshit. I mean, what do you care about any of this? Why do you give a shit what happens to me? Is it because you feel something? Don't worry. I'll get over it. Then if that's the way you feel, then why don't you join the feeding frenzy? I mean, we all know you got plenty of shit on me. You know that I sold Julia out for, what... for a magazine cover. And, hell, she'd - probably still be alive had she not... - Come on. She didn't die because she knew you. Yeah, we screwed up. We did. And believe it or not, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't regret it. But we did not kill Julia Mallory. I forgot what the rally was. I mean, come on. I was 10 years old. Look. My old man came and picked me up. He told my mom he was taking and my sister to a picnic. I ate hot dogs. I had my first beer that day. What? It's crazy. Tell me. My old man won a shooting contest. I mean, these guys were throwing beer bottles up in the air And he was picking them off like they were inches in front of his face. And you were proud. Yeah. You know, all the anger just went away. And he gave me the gun, and I still have the damn thing. I mean, that's crazy, right? No. Not at all. I mean, you know, you think you get where you you want to go in life and everything will just settle, you know? It just gets more complicated. You're not the same person you were six months ago. Neither are you. Do me a favor. Go out with Jasmine tonight and be seen. A black girlfriend trumps a Nazi dad. You said you were on my side, remember? You didn't have to tell me that. I know. I gotta go. Wait. Are you sure? Come on. Do you? We can't do this, Holt. No. You can't do this. It's bad. It's so bad. All we need is one reporter to start digging and... scandal isn't even the word for it. I might have a career left. You wouldn't. Oh, come on. This isn't about careers, but keep telling yourself that. Might convince yourself it's the truth One of these days, you know? [speaking Russian] It's just a movie costume. Look, I signed something - for my job. - Your son's surgery is $48,000. The insurance only covers 28. Here's the other 20. Until recently, my world was all hallucinations. I never knew what was real, and now I do. Is a movie costume real? No. Your son is real. Warehouse, 2252 Wilma, downtown, first floor in the back. Mr. Trisko has a fitting at 11:00. Thank you. - What else? - Okay, best and worst-dressed, you get pages in an hour. Who's gay and who's not, they're still laying out. Dark Guardian... If they get Don's film, they can finish in 20 minutes. We also have soap stars and their brownstones. Let's push that closer to the daytime Emmys or the end of time, whichever's first. Okay. Um, line one. It's a hospital in Oregon. Someone's been in a car accident, and he gave them your name. This is Lucy Spiller. Can we get this thing moving? Where's the costume? I wanna be out of here in time to pick up my kid. I'm busy. Yeah? Don, your brother's been in a car accident. How bad is it? He's okay, but he needs you. Okay, he didn't know how to reach you, so he told them to call me. I made a reservation... 2:30 to Portland, and the ticket's waiting. Lucy, I promised I'd get this shot. I'll get somebody else. I'm in an air vent. Don, listen to me. I'm gonna put Kenny on. Give him your information. I'll find someone else to take the shot. Okay? You need to leave, now. Call me when you get there. Okay. I'm putting Kenny on. Hold on. - Kenny! - Yeah. I want you to find out exactly where Don is and sent that guy, David... whatever his name is... with a camera, and tell him not to wear expensive clothes. - Okay, you have your lunch at 1:00... - All right. Pick up Don. I'm Lucy. You must be Adam. Good to put a face to the name. Come. Lunch is on the way. Please. Do you like men? - Specifically or generally? - Lesbians don't care. Straight women, many of them hate men. - Thank you. - They should. We treat them like shit. I like some men. Do you have an editorial philosophy? Figure out what the readers want before they know what they want, - and give it to them. - That's not good enough. Make them want what they don't want, you raise your circulation. You're very well-paid. When my contract is up, - you'll have to pay me more. - Brent Barrow says the web site can produce more revenue. He wants editorial control. Brent Barrow shouldn't be in control of the air conditioning. Let alone the web site. Your story on a TV show, Cyber Predator... 750 for a source? You want circulation or do you want me to be cautious? TouchÃ©. I had a call from a friend at the studio. They want us to drop the story. I can't think of a better reason not to drop it. I agree with you. We're gonna get along. In life, as in our dreams, it's not how far we go together, it's what we do when we get there. Lunch. Oh, boy. I figured out what's wrong with all of your copy. Well, do tell, Maxwell Perkins. Who's Maxwell Perkins? Enough said. See? That's your problem. I don't know who this Perkins is, and, frankly, you know, I really don't give a shit unless he's got a three-picture deal at Warner or he's a terrific source. You, on the other hand, I swear to God, you... you... You always have to prove that you're the smartest guy in the class. And it shows up in your copy. I don't know. Maybe that's what happens when you go to Harvard, you feel like you're above all of this. But the truth is, is that you love it. You're just too insecure to admit it. So... - do we have a deal? - When did you get like this? Working for a TV studio. Um, well, money's not a problem. Do you have the footage? Yeah. I used my new cell phone that day. Really great quality. I transferred it to this. Yes. Holt McLaren woke up today to more bad news. In the wake of his father's attention-grabbing remarks on race, Hollywood and gay people, his sometime girlfriend Jasmine Ford seems to have had enough. I did not break up with Holt for the simple reason we were never an item to begin with. We're just two people making a movie together. Holt McLaren comes to us to fire back tomorrow in a special live interview on Access Hollywood. We spent 750. We got a bargain. Y-You're kidding me. Where... Where is he? Okay, I'm... I'm going there. The guy running is their production manager. She says the minute he got the call, he went crazy. You can see why they burned and buried their tapes. Tr-Trust me, get back in the car, - What are you talking about? - Please. Jesus! Paul Trisko likes 15-year-old girls. Actually, Lucy, 13. Oh. Well, good-bye, Dark Guardian, and hello, Neverland. Get back in the car and get out of here! What the hell's he carrying? Teddy bear and a bottle of booze. Oh, well, gotta love a pedophile who's a romantic. So, do you think this Becky girl will be okay in court if we get sued? - She seems smart. - Tyler would be a great witness. Yeah, well, the studio could always say this video had nothing to do with Cyber Predator. I think I'll have to do to Jonathan Chubb what he does to everyone else. Congratulations, guys. You did great. Drink up, go home and have some terrific sex. Uh, what, you two haven't done it yet? Sorry. Hey, Jason. Donny. Aw, it must be bad if you're here. I haven't seen you in, what, like, five years? Ten in July. It's good to see you. Don't move. You have a-a fractured arm, and you've broken your leg in three places. They put you together with titanium, and you have a grade II, uh, concussion. - I don't remember any of it. - You were drunk. Three times over the state limit. Did I hurt anyone? I don't know. They say y-you hit a tree and a parked car. You still, - you know? Yeah. - Crazy? Yeah. Kind of. Y-You know, b-better. - Nice balloons. - Yeah. Well, you liked them when you were nine. Broke your leg sliding into third. It's the same leg. - How long you staying for? - I don't know. Does anyone else know? Let's keep it that way, okay? This is far out, man... you taking care of me, huh? It's what we do. We take care of each other. So this has been a hard time for you. Well, it's, um... it's difficult having a father like mine. But it's been going on for a long time, so... So you still carry some resentment? Well, he abandoned my mom and my sister and me when we were kids, so it's, um... It's not like I didn't know that he could say or do stupid things, you know? There are people out there who are saying that you should object more to what he is saying. Well, I probably could've taken a stronger stance. But, you know, I hope that I've made my feelings pretty clear. - Yeah? - I find what he says disgusting. Anything that you would do differently now? Well, I can't seem to do the one thing that a lot of people think that I should do. You know, I just can't pretend that he's not a human being. He's still my father, so... We're here with Holt McLaren, and we will be right back. - Hi. - How am I doin'? You're doing good. You are... You're serious but emotional. You are thoughtful but warm. I'd say you get an A. Who needs a cris manager. I have you, right? It's nice to know I can find a new line of work. You just can't stand my appreciating your help, can you? Yeah, well, it's complicated. You don't think I know that? I know that better than you. Come on. You ought to get back. All right. I'll talk to you later. Um, the art department says you have 10 minutes to transmit a new cover. Legal says Cyber Predator is out of the question. - That's bullshit! - Right. Um, - the guy at legal was pretty... ada... - Send the goddamn cover. - Okay. - Lucy, they're... - here. - Right. Hello. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Sit. There's no need for manners now. So, this is, uh, quite a charge, Lucy. Miss Spiller, you're playing around with people's lives. Neither Mr. Chubb, nor I, nor Mr. Rothman here knows anything about this. And I can assure you that Paul Trisko is no pedophile. You might be right, Mr. O'Connor, 'cause he left before he got the chance. I won't have the integrity of my show questioned like that. He was pushed back into a car. Could be anywhere. Maybe he went to a party, wasn't invited, security told him to go home. You don't believe I have a tape, do you? - Do you? - He was carrying a blue teddy bear and a cheap bottle of scotch, like Vincent's or Barton's... something. The house across the street was 521, and you shot that show at 524 Delaware, Panorama City. Should I go on? What kind of business are you running? I will get to the bottom of this. I'll go public if I find out that you covered up for a child molester. It's his show, his production company. We knew nothing about it. You know, Paul Trisko will be off the lot in an hour. Well, you sort of just admitted it. Look, anyone involved will be fired. Then you'll have to fire yourself. I know that Mr. Rothman wasn't there, but what were you doing in the show's tape library at midnight? - That's right. We have that story, too. - I've heard enough. I'm getting the hell Out of here. Wait, wait, wait. Right there. Why is Jonathan Chubb looking at the furniture? Because he's looking for cameras. That whole losing his temper bullshit, That's 'cause he knows we have video, and he's - playing to the balcony. - Uh, our Paul Trisko tape's been on the web site 21 minutes. - Four million hits. The server crashed. - Wow. It's all over the news. Every story mentions DirtNow. I told you the cover would be fine. Do you trust me now? Yes. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Never trust me. So I have a couple sitcom tapings I just gotta pop into really quick. - Are you sure you can't hang out? - No, I have dinner with an advertiser. So you drove 16 blocks just to say hi? I'm flattered. You know that night you got the phone call? - You left your phone out on purpose. - Really? You said something about "higher up the pay grade," so I'd be tempted. Your boss knew about Paul Trisko, and you knew he knew, And you got me to do the story. Do you really think I'm that smart? You have your boss's job. A man faces a difficult situation. Let's just say the man is me. He knows about a problem, but he can't say anything because it's gone way too far. His boss won't do anything because he's protecting his ass. So what's this man supposed to do, hmm? He lets someone turn it into a great story. And he looks like a hero, and the studio doesn't make a hundred-million-dollar movie that would've tanked if the child molester story had come out. And a bad guy lost his job, and it just so happens a good guy got it. Every so often, life is fair. - You used me. - Excuse me, my dear? Who used who?
