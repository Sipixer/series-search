It may be a war of the absurd, but it's a war just the same. First, there was Blaire Marshall, princess of pop, without a hit in over a year. Then there was Logan Hicks, struggling after the breakup of his boy band Straight Up Lovin'. But when Blaire met Logan, there was a media frenzy: "Blogan." - And now... - Hey, sugar tits... is that bloat or a blump? Blump. No couple has ever been so controlling about their pregnancy and baby pictures. Clear a path, grease ball. Hey, tough guy... why don't you hold her hand and give us a damn picture? It started eight months ago with their pregnancy announcement and an unforgettable pap confrontation. Make my day. Or maybe they didn't teach you how to throw a punch in boy band school. Get outta my face, bitch! I hope that girlie punch was worth it to you! You just bought me a first-class trip to Bali! It's the perfect storm for a cover story. This baby picture is what Wal-Mart mommy wants. And it's gonna be the next cover of Now. I want some kick-ass cover lines by lunch. I don't have time today for pitches. I'm on my way to Dirt. See ya. Okay. Let's see what we have. I think we're close with the Kira Klay cover. Now, the other magazines will run a cover pretty much like this one. But none of them will run one like this. I had someone on the funeral photos. What, is this too hardcore for you Columbia J-school grads? This isn't Tiger Beat. All right, what's out there today? - Um... celebrity fat farms? - Do you have art? More than you would ever want. All right, I'll put it down for five. Two spreads and a single. Keep the text tight. The photos should sell the story. All right, tell makeup to watch the adjacencies. I don't want Duncan Hines or Betty Crocker ads opposite the fatties. I'm so sorry. Gibson Horne. His car just pulled up. Your office. Terry, take over the meeting. I want some great cover tries and the book on my desk in five minutes. Charge it. Have your ladies teased the entire week. Why don't you have a seat, Brent. - Hello, Gibson. - Hey. Mmm. How're you doin', sweet pea? I'm good! - Are you sleepin'? - Not so much. Oh, you are a beauty. I'm pretty sure you didn't show up to compliment me. I wish I could say you were wrong. Please, have a seat. Lucy... are you familiar with, uh... Tina Harrod? The one who disgraced her magazine by Photoshopping the cover? No, the one who got her news stand up over 150% in less than a year. She's got some very interesting ideas about our operation. Are you talking about bringing her in under me? Um... instead of you. See, Brent's been bringin' me up to speed on the numbers, and seems to me your spending's out of control. Well, if you're talking about overhead-- Oh, I'm talkin' about overhead. Efficiencies. Sell through. Bein' snubbed at the last five ASME Awards. Screw the ASMEs. I mean, they're just a circle jerk for editors to feel good about writing 5,000-word stories on Abu Ghraib. The Drrt efficiencies are strong... and Now is turning around. Well, you're gonna make 'em for less money. Knock off 20%. - Oh, come on, Gib. - Lucy, do not mistake fondness for weakness. I will tolerate a lot of things, but I will not tolerate someone losing my money. We'll find a way. No, you'll find a way. Or so help me, I will bury you. Now, you all have a nice day. Damn. I'm tellin' you, buddy. She opened her eyes. She looked at me. She was beautiful. No! No, no! Oh, she's not gonna like that, buddy. She's not gonna like that at all. Okay, everybody. Listen up. Swag pile. Between the watches and the phones and the wrinkle creams and the free spa vacations, there's about $20,000 worth of swag here. Now needs help. Anybody who can come up with a really great exclusive on Blogan gets to pick something from the pile. Don! Lucy? Don, I've left you five messages. Open the door. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - I need to see the Kira Klay shots. - Mmm. Okay. - What? - It's not ready. - The shots? - My house. I don't care about your house. I will be sending over my housekeeper. Uh, no! E-Everything's where it's supposed to be! Okay. I'm so sorry, Lucy. It's okay. It's okay. It's just, it's filthy. And I didn't get the shot. What!? Jesus, Don, this is not the goddamn day! What happened? I--I--I was usin' the lapel camera, and then when I got to her, I switched to the ChapStick cam 'cause I wanted it to be perfect, and it was. It was perfect. There was a shaft of light from outside, and... she was beautiful, she was perfect. And then I... guess there was a light leak when I've never had a light leak in a ChapStick camera. I want that cover and set. Do you know if she's being cremated or buried? No, Lucy, please. - I'm gonna make some calls. - She's not gonna like that. - What? - Nothin'. Okay, Don. Now, I really need your help. We've got one more shot at this if we're lucky. Lucy's under a lot of pressure. Okay, Don, sweetheart... would you look at me? Okay? This is just like when we were in school, on the paper, remember? Okay? We were the only ones who could write and shoot. It's just like that. It's just the two of us. - Now, we can't fail. - I won't fail, Lucy. I won't. Okay. Mind if I cut in? Hey! Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh! Call Security and you don't make it home tonight. Or else I pull out a Sharpie, sign a sneaker or some shit, and they'll load you in the trunk for me. It's good to see you. You look good. Thought we had something special. We did. We do. So special you set me up? I wouldn't--uhh! Uhh... His name's Don. Unhh! He lives in east Hollywood. I have his card. - Hey, Lucy, I got something. - What? Blaire Marshall just made a seven-figure deal to pose for Playboy. Two months after her due date. Denise Richard's was six. Two months? That's impossible. Uh... excuse me. Elliott Greene gets to pick something from the swag pile. Swag pile. Hey... Hey, what's my sweet little nephew doing tomorrow? Brent, get outta my chair. Ohhh... I did it. Hey, you know somethin'? You should be kissin' my ass just a little bit more, considering I probably just saved your job. Oh, so after you threaten it, now you're gonna save it? Oh, gimme a break. We both know you want to stay here. Let me see your little masterpiece. 'Course, editorial's gonna take the biggest hit. Well, it's already a wasteland. Look at these bullshit numbers. What, y-you're just gonna eliminate the fact-checking department? How much crack are you smoking? You know what I love about you? Besides, you know... nothing? It's that can-do attitude. You know what you can do? You can get your ass outta my office. I count a 23% reduction in overhead right there. 20% of which is in editorial. This is like a cheap power grab. Excuse me. I have two magazines to put out. I love your proposal, by the way. It's so colorful. Gib is gonna love it. - Excuse me, Lucy. - Thank you. Oh, she's like 23. She's way too old for you. No, 23's good. * In my own world * * Underneath my clothes * * And I can't get off * * It's been a long, long way down * * I do it every day and I don't know * * If I want to be here anymore * * Oh, it comes and changes * I've told you guys a million times, leave the packages at the door. Don't ring. It's Holt McLaren. What are you doing here? Well, you told me if I ever need anything... Well, you gave me your address. You could've called. Well, I didn't. So, can I talk to you? It'll just take a minute. Mm-hmm. You look different. I was almost asleep. What's up? I--I need a favor. A favor? What kind of favor? For Julia. Look, uh, I wanna... I wanna do somethin nice for her. 'Cause she's wrecked. She's on these painkillers. She can't sleep. She doesn't even rember what happened with Kira and with the accident. Well, I'm sure you filled her in on everything. Yeah. 'Course I did. She lost her best friend. So you want to do something nice and make it all better. Oh, come on, Lucy, don't give me your patronizin' bullshit. Look. Please. I'm askin' you for a favor, like... a little piece in your magazine to make her feel better. Just a little better, for a minute. Julia is a part of a whole feeding frenzy. People only want to hear "poor Julia" stories. What, so... so that's it? It is if you don't stop the "Aw, shucks, I'm from West Virginia" thing. I've invested way too much time and energy in you. You had this heroic moment. The whole world sees you differently. You are a star now. You have power. - All right. - Ohh... Then demand things. If you don't start using your power, you will lose it. All right, so-- so give Julia story. Do it. - Does Julia know Blaire Marshall? - Yeah. They were in Hell House together. I need an extra 500 for the wait. Mm-hmm. Okay. And just get the face. I don't want anyone to be able to see the crematorium. I'm really sorry, but I have to take your picture now. Lucy needs it. She has to compete in a very tough market. She's a good person. She just has to compete, 'n', yeah. I have-- I gotta help her because I'm the only one she has, and... Yeah, I can't fail. I thought you were great in From Here to America and Hell House, and Made You Look, and An Earthly September. That one got five stars, and your performance was joyously transcendent, according to Elvis Mitchell, The New York Times. All right. We gotta move this one. Okay. Been nice talkin' to you. Bye. Excuse me. Hey. Um... I couldn't help but overhear that you're in the child care field? That's right. We just lost our wonderful person this week, and I am just desperate. You don't have an agency? Oh, no, no. Of course we do. It's just, um... you know, we have to go through a hundred interviews before we can find someone who's... you know, who's discreet enough. - Oh? - Well, my husband's... he's... very prominent in the entertainment industry. Really? And who's that? I'm--I'm so sorry. I... can't tell you. Um... you know how it is. With security and everything, it's crazy. It can be so, um, so isolating sometimes. I wish we could live a normal life. You know? Well, of course you do, dear. Oh, I'm so sorry! I-- I don't even know you. Have a wipe, darlin'. Now... - You were sayin'? - Well, I just thought... you might know who... you know, the most discreet celebrity baby nurses might be. There's just a handful, dear. I know. You know, I was just, um... talking to that wonderful nurse who Blaire and Logan are using, and she was telling me that she had a friend who might be available. But... you know, I can't reach them because... they've gone into hiding. Blaire and Logan's baby nurse. You mean Gabriella. Yes! Yes! Yes, yes. That's right. That's right. Gabriella. Mm-hmm. Um... Lucy? Hey. I got something on the baby nurse. Yeah? Um... name, number, rates, a little history, hometown, immigration status. Nice. You can pick something from the swag pile. Oh... no, thanks. "No, thanks"? Well... it sounds kind of stupid, but, um... I do it for the story. Here, check this out. What is it? It's a still from the Altman film where Blaire played a pregnant runaway. Wow. She really looks pregnant. She really does. So? So... she's not having a baby? But she made a deal with People to take her first baby pictures. - Black market? - No. If she's too vain to carry a baby, she's way too vain not to have a little Blogan. Surrogate. Find out where this pregnancy pad is. And check into all of our fertility clinic sources. Willa, listen to me. If this gets out in any way, they get onto us, the whole story's over. Whether she's carrying a baby or not, this girl's my next cover. Do you understand? - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. Oh. Oh. I'm--I'm sorry - That's okay. - Okay. So, there was a break-in last fall at the Universal wardrobe house. They claimed a couple of pieces of costume jewelry and a clown suit. And... three of the pregnancy prosthetics built for Blaire Marshall for the Altman film. Let me guess. One for each trimester. - You got it. - Oh, this is great. Okay, just keep following this story. Don't leak a word, not even in-house I want you to create a secret edit queue and file your stuff there. I want only dummy text and gray space up on that wall. - You know what really pisses me off? - What? I was the first person to report this pregnancy... and she played me. God, I really don't appreciate that. - Stick around. - Okay. Also, Willa, I'm gonna want you to write some copy on a fashion piece that we're doin' on Julia Mallory. It's a many-looks retrospective kind of thing. She's gonna be coming in and sitting with you and one of our photo editors. I--I thought we were sticking to the tragedy angle on her. Yeah, well, we're gonna go a little counter to that... see how that plays. Okay. Holt! Hey, dude. Hey. Look at you, man... lean and mean. What are you here for, a meeting? Yeah. - Which one? - Angry Inch. Right. - Passed on it. - 'Course you did. Your teeth look really white. Did you get veneers or something? No. I gotta go. Yeah, I heard you got the Fincher movie. How's it goin'? It's okay, thanks. Yeah. I was up for that shit. Thought it fell apart in the second act. But when I sat down with Fincher... I was, like... "Holt McLaren could be really awesome for this part," so...who knows? - Maybe I got you the part. - Listen, Johnny. You didn't get me the damn part. In got the part. I got the part because people want me. I got the part because people want me. You're the punch line to a half a dozen jokes in this town. And the only reason no one has told you what a total blight you are to humanity is because you make $5 million a movie. Dude! What is your damage? Oh, yeah... and I made seven mil for Subliminal Velocity. Enjoy it while it lasts, dude. Say hi to Julia for me, will you? It's a pleasure to meet you, Gabriella. I wanted to come here in person to tell you that I don't want anything from you. I don't want to be famous. And I'm not interested in your magazine. And I don't betray my clients. Okay. Well, thanks, anyway, for coming in. Is that it? Um... yeah. Willa, you want to walk her out? Oh, do you want your parking validated? Oh, no. I didn't park in your-- I mean, certainly, if you're going to remain loyal when you're getting paid half the going rate, then there's nothing I can say. What do you mean, half the going rate? The Tom-Kitten baby nurse? 95 an hour. That's a 12-hour minimum. 24 when they travel, and, uh, plus the confidentiality clause, that's, um-- I don't know. You do the math. - But they--they-- - Kyle and Deb? 80. And they're nowhere near the stars that Blaire and Logan are. They told me this was the top rate. And yet you remain loyal. I think that's fantastic. And what if I didn't? Well, um... I know that you don't want to be a star. But, um, I also know that you're from Flor de Mayo and that your mother and sister are there with other family members. - How do you know about my-- - I'm a journalist. And I know that you worry about them and their standard of living. And if I help you? Well, there's a farm with some acreage and a very nice house next to your mother that's for sale for about $200,000, U.S. I think that if you help us... that could be a very realistic goal. Now, the insiders are reporting that she's going to induce at the superstar suiteat Cedars. They're all camped out there, but I--I don't think they're gonna go to Cedars. No, I think there'll be too many unanswered questions there... you know, due to the nature of the pregnancy. Don't you think? I think you are right. But they don't tell me the location. When the baby comes, they will call, and then they will send a car. Okay, well, why don't you let us worry about that? Allyouneed to do is take that baby to the window for a shot of California sun. You know how the babies get jaundice. It's the house... plus 100,000, U.S. I want half the money upfront, nonrefundable. And the other half if you get your picture. Congratulations on your new home. Here, I'll walk you out. Hey. - Hey, I can't see the screen. - Sorry. Babe? Yeah? I was thinkin'. We should, um... we should send somethin' to Blaire and Logan. You know, some kind of baby gift? I--I know. Totally. Where they havin' the baby? I should get the address. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Yes! Level five. - What? - The address. Oh, I know, you have to call her mom 'cause they're hiding out there until it's time. Um, it's in my book. It's under "B.M., mom." Cool. Hey... - I love you. - I loveyou. I love you. - Well, was that-- - It was great. But... you didn't... No. Nothin'? No, no, no. I didn't say nothing - Oh. - No. No. I just didn't come. Sorry. Oh. No, it was nice. Well... maybe you could give me some direction. I could draw you a map. It's not gonna happen. Listen, it's not you. Okay, I just--I have better luck alone Oh. So... a vibrator? You know, they say you can get, like, desensitized. Yeah. Well, maybe I was never sensitized to begin with. What about, um... Did you... Did you come the last time? So... what am I doing here? I had a really nice time. There's that word again, "nice." And "had." So... does that... that mean it's over? I do have a lot of work to do. Mmm. So... essentially, I'm a booty call. Well... yeah. Yeah. I don't know why I'm having such a problem with that. You know how many times I've wanted a chick to turn into a sandwich when I was done? I'm a rock musician. Booty call's are my stock in trade. Well, then, if anybody understands, then... Right. Right. I'll just... grab my stuff. Yeah. Right. You know, I make pancakes from scratch. Mmm. Carbs. Or I could get out my guitar and play you some Bon Jovi sounding bullshit ballad... tell you I wrote it for you. I've got, like, two more hours of work to do tonight. Wow. You're like a guy. You really are. See you later. - This is surreal. - What? I don't know. It just seems like we do a lot to avoid these magazines. Yeah, but this'll be good for you. All right? It's gonna get you back in the public eye. You're right. It's still surreal. Hi! Hi. Thank you guys so much for coming down. I'm Willa McPherson. - Julia Mallory. - Holt McLaren. 'Course I know who you both are. You're my favorite Hollywood couple. Sorry. Um, follow me. So, our idea is to do a sort of "many looks of Julia Mallory" piece. We're gonna pull a bunch of really great red carpet shots and some candids and, you know, different haircuts 'cause readers love that kind of thing. And, the art department is this way. Hello. Oh. This is our editor-in-chief Lucy Spiller. - Hi. - How are you? Thank you so much for doing this for me. Oh, no. Thank you for your willingness to be a part of the story. And you, the hero. I know. I wouldn't be here to do this story if it weren't for him. No, you wouldn't. Well, we should, uh, we should probably do this. Right? She's gotta get home and get some rest. Oh, okay. Bye. I'll introduce you guys to the photo editor. Come on. Come on. Hey, hey, hey! Hey! - What're you-- Prince Tyrese! - Yeah, that's right! I'm, uh, a big fan. Bullshit! You set me up with that skank! Those pho-- Those pictures, those were great. You-- You were in the hot tub and the chaise lounge and the whipped cream. And then the strap-on right in your butt-- You wanna talk about that anymore, huh? Why don't you say that shit again and see what happens! No. Who you workin' with? I'm a small businessman. - Who hired you for those pictures? - Nobody! Just me. You lyin' nutbag! You hold the third-highest all-time rebound record. But your free throw percentage is hurting the team. In the first three games of the season, you averaged 22 points a game. That went up to 26 points by game four. Then you fouled out. You son of a bitch! You're bent. Technically, I'm schizophrenic, but-- I function. So beautiful. - What? - So beautiful. He was my buddy here, but he's gone... Gone. Crazy little cockroach. This shit ain't over! Okay. There they are! Cedars will be a zoo. We'll send some shooters there to throw people off.</i> Now, the competion is going to be insane. But that's okay because we've got the right information.</i> Our intel says the baby's going to be born somewhere else. Blogan! Blogan! Come on, Blaire. Blaire, over here. Blogan! Get him to turn around. Blaire! Here! They're gonna be using decoys and imposters to evade us.</i> But we are gonna be in the right place at the right time. Come on, that's not the shot. - Yeah, I got it. - Yes.</i> Yes! I'm counting on you, Danny; I thought that was obvious. Yeah. Lakeside. Thursday. Love to Katie. If Tina Harrod can beat that, he should give her the job. How's that feel? To be the first tabloid editor to put a dead star on the cover? - It feels great. - Oh, yeah? Great, like... like pornographer great? Well, you call it what you want. Just about every news outlet in the world has picked up this story. The media bloggers are going ape-shit, and you think that cover's not gonna pop? I told you to up the draw. And people made a deal for 1.5 million for the baby Blogan pictures. We scooped 'em for expenses. No doubt about it. You're the queen. And you were the only one who nailed the Blogan thing. God. God. I mean, too vain to carry your own baby. And the exclusive with the surrogate. It's a great touch. So... what are you gonna do next week, your highness? - Maybe I'll get lucky. - Oh, yeah? You know somebody else who's gonna die? Some other big celebrity couple who's gonna fake a baby we can steal pictures of? 'Cause those are the only kind of covers that are gonna keep us out of debt every week. Well, thanks for your concern, but that's my problem. No, it's not. As of tomorrow, it's Tina Harrod's problem. Unless you accept my cuts. Holy shit. Hi. I want you, Terry, and Janice to meet me in the office in 15 minutes. - They did a nice job, huh? - Yeah. Looks awesome. You wanna go out? Are you feelin' up to it? - Yeah. Why not? - All right. I'll get dressed. HOLT MCLAREN IS READY FOR HIS CLOSE-UP</b> Oh, this better be good, sweet pea, 'cause what I was dreamin', ooh, is illegal in most states. Let me just say this, Gibson. Whatever happens tonight... you will never forget this moment. This is what we both live for. You want to cut your overhead by 20%? How about 50? We combine the magazines-- one monster publication. The credibility of Now with all the lurid fun of Drrt. Well, it's a glossy tabloid. No. It is more than that. No, this is People magazine with a healthy dose of "screw you." It's The National Enquirer without the penis enlargement ads. Wal-Mart mommy will love it, and so will the rich sorority girls. You know, when I bought Now magazine, I thought I paid my way into legitimacy. I bought an institution. Now magazine brought America through the second half of the 20th century. It was solid, and it was dependable, but it is over. It's culturally irrelevant. Well, then I'm culturally irrelevant. No. Not if you change. Not if you charge the old with the new. Look at Blaire and Logan. These are two has-beens that became huge because they joined forces. We have the chance to shape American culture. Is this the shape we want for the culture? You're the one who always says, "Let the market place decide." This is what the marketplace wants. You need this. No. You need this. If I do this for you... You name it. I'll do anything. I know this will succeed. I know it. I can feel it. Brent Barrow know anything about this? I came straight to you. Vision is not a part of his job. He won't be pleased. I don't give a shit. I don't work for him. And God help you if you're wrong. I won't be. You see? Told ya... * You know what you do before, * * it was better to be following me. * * Yeah, 'cause I could see clearly * * Occasionally * * Oh, put your faith in me. * *Follow, follow... * * I relieve your duty * * Dutifully * * I will take your butter * * If you won't butter me * * Follow me down this hole Darlin' * Morning, sweetheart. * Follow me a little blindly *
