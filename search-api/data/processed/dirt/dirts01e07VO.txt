schizophrenic, blah, blah, blah.</i> Dad, I think it's time. No offense, but if you don't know that by now,</i> then you have worse attention skills than me.</i> That's Lucy Spiller. Again, no offense, but you should be up on this shit by now.</i> Lucy has sort of a problem with men.</i> You're not gonna use a stun-- Good night, Holt. But that's not the case with Holt McLaren.</i> Lucy got what she wanted. Holt got worms. Remember those pictures I took of happily married action hero</i> and international superstar Jack Dawson and Lucy's brother Leo</i> a while back? They're starting to cause a lot of trouble.</i> Holt didn't see the worms when he threw up,</i> but he did see the track marks on the arms of his girlfriend</i> - <i>Julia Mallory.</i> - What the hell is that? Jesus Christ, Julia! What are you doing? - It's not a big deal. - <i>The magazine is doing this big story</i> about this cheerleader murder. Turns out the murdered girl was involved with the town preacher.</i> I've I. D.'d the father of the victim's unborn baby. - <i>Oh. And she was pregnant.</i> - My God. He was also sleeping with his daughter.</i> I don't think there'll be any World's Greatest Dad mugs</i> coming his way soon. Lucy ran that on the cover. God bless Don Konkey. He had the right shots all along. Not everyone was happy. Who told you my father killed Amber? Who said that? I did it! Not Daddy! On the bright side, I'm dating again,</i> and I'm 99% sure this one is real. Wait. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Okay. Oh, God! You want to go again? Don't you want to save one for the home team? I heard she moved from prescription drugs to self-medication. What is she on? I'm asking as a friend. You want a beer? Yeah. You? This is wrong. Don't take me on your guilt trip. No. You're poison, Lucy. Excuse me? We have to stop. Then what are you doing standing here? Synchro: Metalmarco, Pasbel, Yellow Sub Transcript: Swsub.com SynchFix: Metalmarco ::ITA-SA:: & _/Yellow Sub\_ Proudly Present: Dirt - Season 01 Episode 07 - "Come Together" Herring worm's rare. Human cases like yours are more common in Japan, Netherlands. Bet you like sushi. I used to. Okay. Thiabendazole. You're gonna be fine. Joanna, can you schedule another ultrasound for next week so we can get a head count? And, uh, would you mind? What happened to the one we already took? My glasses reflected the flash. All right. 1, 2-- Oh, wait. There we go. And 3. Willa, right? - I'm Brent Barrow. - Oh. Of course you are. Oh, I'm sorry. I mean of course I know who you are. That's all right. That story-- the reverend who molested his kid and knocked up her cheerleader friend was... juicy. You're a very talented young woman. - Uh, Thank you, Mr. Barrow. - What are you working on now? Uh, it's the same story. The reverend's daughter told me that she's the one who killed her best friend. She confessed that to you? Yeah. The cops don't even know yet. Lucy thinks the confession cover might hit the stands before she's even arrested. Chuck and I are going back today to get her full interview. No. No. Come on. You don't need to share your byline with that old boozer. Tell Lucy to show you more respect. You're editorial material, Willa. - Thank you. - Listen, please. Reporters like you make my job an honor and a pleasure. Uh, Chuck? Time to go? Uh, I'm worried about this interview. Nothing to worry about. Well, Maddy called me specifically. It's because she trusts me. You want to go eat on the way? I vote for Quiznos. Look, Chuck, she's a sexual abuse victim. I don't want her to clam up because there's a man in the room. Little Willa wants to fly solo and not share a byline. It's nothing personal. It's just... Lucy's wrong. I don't need help with this. I agree. Really? You got my blessing. Will you clear it with Lucy? We'll tell her after. Thank you. Isn't it great? I discovered the artist myself. Do you get it? Average person spends two weeks of their life on hold. How sick is that? I like hold. It's free time. My God, you're right. I never thought of it like that. What's your IQ? I don't know. You should get tested. You're probably over 140. My best friend in New York-- he's a published poet-- he's 140. What's your process? When you write on your photographs, how long does it take? I wake up... it's there. Oh. You black out. What are you, epileptic? Narcoleptic? Schizophrenic. Genius does not go unpunished. Meet the bulimic. Relax. I use the other hand. Have you and your father always been close? Madonna's mom died, too. So did Rosie O'Donnell's. Is that when it started? When it was just the two of you? Have you ever interviewed Nicole or Lindsay? Um... No, I haven't. Maddy, come here. Come here. This is hard. I love my dad. I'm just here to write what you tell me. It's up to you, okay? This is your story. She's just here to take some photos. Of me? Is that okay? Maddy, when did you find out that Amber was pregnant? She told me after the pep rally. We both painted the tips of my batons cherry red, like snow cones. What did she say? They loved each other. Amber and your father. And that God had blessed their love by giving them a child. She said she was Sarah, Abraham's wife, and now she would be my mother. I told her no way she was Sarah. She was Hagar, Sarah's servant. Hagar's baby is not blessed. It says in the Bible-- God says, "Hagar's son will live in hostility toward all of his brothers." I told her, "Read your Scripture". "You can't have this baby". "I'm Sarah". "Daddy calls me Sarah when he puts his love in me." I hit her with my baton. Shouldn't I have make-up? No, honey. Your skin is beautiful. Are you sure? Well, maybe just a little lip gloss. - Here. - Kiehl's. It's yours. Thank you. Okay. Hey. The car's here. I'm gonna go to work. I'll see you in a little bit, all right? - No. No. - Hey. The car's here. I want to go with you. No. Go back to sleep. I'll see you in a little while. Please, I want to come to the set. They're kind of freaky about guests. You know, today's a little tricky, so-- I won't talk to anyone. I'll-I'll just-- I'll stay in your trailer. I'm ready. Come on, you haven't even taken a shower yet. Come on, Holt. I can't stay here by myself. All right? You don't know. You don't. I feel like I'm gonna die. Yeah, it's the damn Vicodan. Why don't you stop taking so many of 'em? - All right? - Okay. I-- I won't take any. I won't take any if I can come with you. I'm gonna be fine if I'm-- if I just am on set. I just need to be around people, that's all. Please, Holt. Then why don't you go hang out with Hannah and Peter today? I can't. They're working. Everybody's working. Nobody's got time. Damn it, I miss Kira. Oh, I'll go shower, and I'll-- I'll get dressed in 10 minutes, okay? Jack Dawson says he's not gay. He's got The Bulldog on speed dial. I got the peter-eater on speed dial. Really? Prepared to testify? That's not the way it works. You want a dogfight? 'Cause I really don't. Oh, don't clench, Brett. You'll get hemorrhoids. Hi. Hi, Lucy. We talked this morning, right? - I told you to stay on Julia Mallory. - Yeah. Oh, you have something already? I need you. What? I'm here. What's wrong? I need to make sure she's real. Okay. Okay, very quiet, people, please. We're rolling.</i> We've got a chair for you right over here. And slate. Crane. Action. This is all I have for you. Too bad. That's enough. And cut. How was that for you? Pretty tight. Remember, I told you about paragliding off the Dolomites of Italy.</i> This... is so much better.</i> I need to change my panties. Yeah. That's what my girl likes, hmm? You're a pig. No, he's sweet. He let me crash your party. Come on. Let 'em kick him to the curb. You'd do that to me, Garbo? For her? What do you think? She is Julia Mallory, and my love for her cannot be quantified. Subliminal Velocity, Hell House-- Camp Crusades: brilliant. But you-- you changed my life with: * All for one, and God will have some fun * * Come on, boys, come on, girls * * Come on, let's put our mark * * On this wild, wild world * * This wild, wild world * * This wild, wild world * What? I want to play, too. - Keep your dick out of my face. - No problem. No problem. So you girls can screw me, suck me, spank me raw for all I care. Whatever you want. Julia? Okay. She comes with me. * This wild, wild world * * This wild, wild world * Here you go. Thank you. Be right back. Very real. I can still smell the patchouli. I like the way she smells. Well, if you like it, then I like it. - How long do we have to sit here? - Just a few minutes. She thinks I'm a genius. Don't I always tell you that? - So you're Don's boss. - Friend. You went to college together. He told me. I'm sorry. I don't read your magazine. Oh, it's not a judgment thing. I just don't have the time. Uh, speaking of time... Julia? I have to go to work. Wait. To the magazine? I thought we agreed. Agreed? That Don shouldn't waste his energy on star stuff. Have you seen his artwork, his picture poems? Yes, I have. Oh, so then you know. Well, maybe just this once. To pay the bills. Okay. - We'll talk more tonight? - Bye. Thanks, Lucy. He sent me here to see if you were real. He's schizophrenic. He told me. Did he tell you he writes those picture poems when he forgets to take his meds? Uh, I know you mean well, but you're not really helping him. You're using him. I'm gonna chalk that up to young and dumb. Look, play patron of the arts if that's what gets you off. But don't play with people's lives. That's what you do for a living. Thought you didn't read the magazine. Only in the toilet. Okay. Let's not personalize this. I'm glad that Don has a friend who appreciates him. And you're right. He's very talented. He's also caring and loyal, and he has a very real disease. He has a label given to him by a society that won't tolerate anything but the status quo. Don's an artist. Art is born of pain. He's entitled to feel what he feels. Get someone else to cut an ear off for you. Like you got him to cut off his finger? Leo. Don't recognize me in the burkha? Justine Dawson. I have to dress like my maid to avoid the paparazzi. Aren't you gonna say hello? - Look, I'm sorry-- - I liked your color sense. I'm just sorry you couldn't keep your hands off my husband. - Jack came on to me. - I don't give a shit. - I'm not the first. - Just the first to sell him out-- and not even for the money, just revenge. What a big baby you are. Here, I want you to have these. This is a letter from my 11-year-old asking her father to come home. Oh, didn't you know? Jack moved out of the house. And here! Ben found this in his desk. "Your dad is a pipe smoker." It's a clever drawing. He's lighting his own penis. - This wasn't-- - Emma's 11, and Ben's only 8. So maybe that isn't much of a score. But they will carry this with them for the rest of their lives. So congratulations. Revenge is sweet. - Watch-- - Go! Get off me! I see you took my advice. Well, it was really good advice. What are you gonna do to celebrate? Some of the gang told me they'd take me out for a drink. And what about after? Excuse me, Miss. I was just looking for the toilet. Hello, Bulldog. I'd get up, but that might be mistaken for a sign of respect. I got a call from Jack Dawson. Don't take the case. I know how you hate to lose. I will be subpoenaing your brother. I know he's the source. Every story in this magazine is verified by more than one source. Fag makes grab at movie star's pistol and gets fired on the spot. Big sister cooks up a story to save his pride and up her sales. I don't need to cook it up in this town. I step in it the minutes I walk out the door. And you sure stepped in it this time, sugar. I'd think about printing a retraction, and an apology. And I'd think about that hat. Um, you guys go ahead, and I'll meet up with you later. Maddy? Hello? You have to help me. Grandma says I'm going to jail. I can't go! I won't! You said it would be all right. What-- Hey-- Just slow down. I-- I lied to you, Willa! I'm sorry. It wasn't me. I didn't-- I didn't kill Amber. He did. My daddy. What? Maddy-- He-- He made me lie. He told me to lie. He made me. All right, look, I'm coming to see you. Just stay there. Don't talk to anybody. Okay. Hey. Chefs don't clean up. - Leo, let it go. - Can't. - You can. - You didn't see her. She married his box office. Her whole life is a lie. Those kids are going through hell. No worse than we did. Yeah. Look at us. You have to stop worrying about her and start thinking about yourself. Jack Dawson's lawyer is threatening to put you on the stand if you don't make a retraction. Okay? You know I can't do that. You'd rather drag everyone through a public hearing? Okay, I asked you more than once, "Are you sure you want to do this, Leo?" You said to me "You bet your ass." That is a direct quote. Yes, it is. - I warned you. - You warned me. Warning me was bullshit. You should have said "He has a family and two kids." Oh, like you didn't know that? God. Are people even real to you? Yes. You're real. This is so unfair, Leo! You have to tell me the truth. Look, I can't help you unless I know what happened. Maddy. Amber told Daddy he had to marry her, and if he didn't, she'd tell the police he raped her. You were there? What happened? They argued. He hit her with my baton, then he stabbed her. That's the truth. You have to fix it. You said nothing bad would happen. You promised. You promised me! Okay. - What do you want for these? - They're yours. The negatives in the vault? Why waste the space? I can get more anytime. So can anyone else Here. Conquistador House. It's east of Santa Barbara. I made a call. They'll have a bed ready for her tomorrow. I never even heard of it. Total privacy, and total commitment to recovery. Why are you doing all this? Two more badges, and I make Eagle Scout. Do you even know why you stick around? Is it love, or is it guilt? Are you afraid to find out? I'm not. You didn't know her before everything. She was always happy. She was just-- She was full of light. Laughed all the time. Jesus, Holt, she's not dead. Yet. Lucy. Maddy didn't kill Amber. Reverend Sweet did it. He forced her to confess, but the story's already been shipped. What are we gonna do? Relax. We have the transcripts. The story is solid. But Maddy could go to jail for a murder she didn't commit. Okay. Get a follow-up statement from Sweet Is he still in prison? Her father manipulated her into taking the blame. We have to do something: insert a denial or something. How about a press release saying "Don't buy <i>Dirt Now</i>"? How's that? She's just a little girl. I promised her that I would protect her. She is a story. She's not your friend. You protect your source. You protect the truth. You don't protect the little girl. She's a liar, Willa. You know that. She told you herself. You both got what you wanted. You got your cover story. Leo. Hi, it's me. Would you please pick up? I want to talk to you. Come on. I know you're there. You know, you really are a dick sometimes. She's not really your friend, Don. I hope you don't mind me saying this. Who? Lucy. Lucy's my friend. If she were, she wouldn't ask you to sell your soul. Is that her? No. Your salacious lies have put Jack Dawson's career as a leading man in the crapper. Good news, though. He's always wanted to be a media tycoon, so we'll settle for everything in Gibson Horne's portfolio. Oh, my-- Two scenarios: lawsuit. Process of discovery. Our lawyers call every gigolo, masseuse, trainer, pool boy, and ass toy Jack's ever employed. All rumors, innuendoes, and impressions become facts of the case, and that means we can publish them. I mean, that should be worth-- what do you think, five covers at least? Jack Dawson will be America's proud gay icon. Scenario 2: drop the lawsuit. Look, the damage has been done, people. There's not enough money to indemnify you against the lawsuit we will bring. One year from today... you will all be working for Jack Dawson. Well, until he fires you. Good day. Mom? Dad? Seen this? She didn't do it, Chuck. She was covering for her father. Cops found the baton. Plenty of prints: Maddy, not Daddy. That's because it was her baton. The medical examiner matched the angle and depth of Amber's stab wounds to Maddy's height and weight. Innocent until proven guilty, of course. Arise, my little "protege'", and join the ranks. I shouldn't have cut you out. I wasn't ready. You did great. No, I didn't handle it right. I let her get to me. When it stops getting to you, that's when you're in trouble. You missed a spot. You'll get it. I don't need this. You can help me. I don't need to be here. Sweetie, listen to me. There's something I've never told you. Please, babe, can we just go home? You remember that day that we met? Well, I wasn't really there to audition. I followed you from the coffee shop. And you got your drink, and the guy made a mistake with your change, and... he gave you a 20 instead of a 1. And you gave it back. Then I couldn't think of anyone that wouldn't have kept the 20. And you were so beautiful. You were the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. I want that girl back. No, it's okay. I got this. I got it. No. No! Julia, come here. Please, Holt, please! No, please. Sorry, come on. No! No! No! - Please stop. - No! Calm down. Come on. Come on. Julia, stop. Julia. Julia, stop No! Come on. Listen. Listen. Everything's gonna be all right. You can trust me. Come here. Come here. Everything's gonna be all right. You're not the first. Stop beating yourself up. Thank you. Lucy thinks I'm an amateur. I'm so pissed to myself. Close your eyes... and tell me what color you see. It's an old trick I learned from a-a bushman in Zimbabwe. What do you got to lose? Okay. Red. All right. Put that red... right there. Now... see it move down. Down your shoulder, down your arm... into your wrist... your hand... fingers-- - What are you doing? Don't talk. Don't-- ...look. Just... No feeling is bad if you know what to do with it. What are you feeling right now? Well, thank you, and I want to get right to</i> the photos that appeared in the magazine.</i> How did that happen? Tabloids will print anything to sell paper, Tony, even if they have to make it up.</i> We just don't pay attention. My lawyers told me that I should sue, but I will not dignify these lies with a legal response. Justine and I, we know who we are. We don't have to spend time or money proving anything</i> to anyone. - Good God. I want you to know, Tony, this is the last time I'm gonna give an interview on the topic.</i> - Never again? - Never again.</i> No, no. Justine and I-- Hey, turn on the TV. Channel 4. God's in His heaven, and all is right with the world. - You're pregnant? - Absolutely.</i> Come on. I know you're there. I miss you. Show him the ring. Jack Dawson's backing off. He's not gonna sue.</i> That is a stun-- I was gonna call you to say good-bye. You going somewhere? Oh, my God, of course you are. One of your little walkabouts. You always run away. Nothing keeping me here. You can hide, Leo, but the old shit's gonna be here when you come back Look, I don't want to fight. Where are you going? How can I reach you? I don't know, but if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Is that a joke? Look, hon, you can't leave me. I need to get away from you for a while. I think it's catching. The last couple of days, I've felt, uh... numb. Is that how it starts? You can't be mad at me forever. I know. Justine, thank you very much. - Thank you. - Congratulations. Jack, always good to see you. They are back in the news and yes, at it again. But this time, Lindsay and Paris are fighting-- no, not over a boy toy, Shaun-- no, over an actual movie role. Yeah, that's right, Tony. The two scrappy vixens are battling over which one will play the role of Maddy Sweet in the hottest new film property in town. Now, Sweetis based on the infamous cheerleader murder in Walnut Valley, California. You know, maybe Lindsay and Paris could make up and do the film together. One could play Maddy, and the other could play Amber Carmichael.</i> You know, Amber's the victim, and everybody says</i> the bad girl role is always the better role.</i> - You're probably right about that. - Maybe.</i> Either way, Adaptation helmer Spike Jones</i> is rumored to be looking to direct, and production</i> on Sweet is slated to start as early as this summer</i> for a holiday release. What, a
