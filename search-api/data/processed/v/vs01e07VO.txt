about who he really is. I think Tyler's ready. But he's still not here on the ship with you. Get him. I missed you. I'm pregnant. You need to tell her the truth before she finds out. John May started the 5th Column. The first group to ever turn against the leadership. - Anna's birthing soldiers. - You need to stop 'em. The visitors took everything I had. I don't want that to happen to you. Long live the 5th Column! Dad, I heard something outside, and I think I saw a UFO. There's no such thing as UFOs, buddy. Go back to bed. That's okay. Go on. I love you, James. They're here for me. Tell the others I'm going dark. Did you really think Anna wouldn't find out you turned against us? How could you do this to your own kind, - start a resistance? - These people are worth saving. It's your human skin. You've been wearing it too long. You got confused. - You're sick. - Bliss is a sickness. It's mind control. Human emotion, it's not sickness. It's beautiful. Human emotion? You betrayed us for human emotion? You may as well kill me now. Cause I will never stop hunting you. One day you'll understand. You can't escape, John May! You can't escape! Can someone please lay out for me who the hell that guy is? John May was the first V to turn against Anna. He started the resistance. I was with him just before he disappeared. - You knew him. Why didn't you say? - No one needed to know until now. The bottom line is we are not leaving Georgie up there to die. The only reason he's on that ship is because he tried to save me. - I gotta get back on the ship. - But how? It'll be impossible now. We'll do it. We'll figure it out. How much does he know... about who you are, where you are? Who your loved ones are? I'm not saying he'll talk cause he's a coward. I'm saying, everyone has a breaking point. Everyone talks. Not Georgie. He'll hold on till we get him. Which as you compadre here just spelled out, is impossible. We may not get back on that ship, but there may be another way to save him. How? The one who helped me embed the message. He's 5th Column. Said there's a way to contact them, some sort of comms device. It's encrypted and the tech's outdated, so the Vs don't monitor for it anymore. - If we can get... - We can coordinate a rescue plan with the 5h Column aboard the ship. First sensible thing anyone's said, and it's the blonde. - Where's the device? - Upstate. Town called Reedsville. Belonged to John May. But there's someone else. His stepson. He might be able to lead us to that device. Great. Let's go. The human managed to fight off the effects of the memory chamber. We've been unable to retrieve any information about who helped him embed the message in our broadcast. He won't give names. Impress upon him more strongly that he has no choice in the matter. I've already sent for the human pain expert from the Tokyo ship. Your pregnancy... You should be resting. There's no time for that. I need to make sure the "Live Aboard" program stays on track. There are whispers of an anti-V terrorist group. Polls show people have grown apprehensive about coming to live on the ship, which will affect the success of our "Live Aboard" program. Get Chad Decker. I'll address the people directly. I want those bodies on this ship. Hi. Hello. You are? Lisa, Tyler's friend. - It's nice to meet you, Mr. Evans. - Hi. Tyler's mom didn't mention anything about you coming. Did Tyler invite you? Actually no. I just thought I'd check in on him. Why does he need you to check in? He didn't. I thought he could use the support. It's just this situation's been a little hard, right? Since you left? Have you had breakfast yet? I'm sorry. Wait a minute. What did he say, exactly? He hasn't said anything bad about you, Mr. Evans. So you guys met. Don't worry, dad. I slept on the couch. I swear. Lisa showed up late last night, And kind of surprised me. Surprised me, too. Could you... come here, please? Listen, I know you wanted to spend some time with me. But is it okay if she hangs with us? Dad... I really like her. Of course. Thanks. This is Chad Decker for WNT, bringing you an exclusive interview with the V high commander Anna. - It's good to see you again. - Thank you, Chad. There have been rumors about the messages sent from our ships during my announcement last night. Yes. "John May lives"... - Can you tell us what that means? - I wish I could, Chad. It appears it was merely a glitch in our system, an overlay of old code from our language training program used to learn the English language. What's of greater interest to me are the things that are going right. People are so excited about the "Live Aboard" program. It will give us a chance, before we leave, to reciprocate the hospitality you have shown us. Later today, you will join me as I sit down with some of the invitees to answer their questions. I can assure you, those joining us will be treated with the utmost care and respect. This is the last time we're going to ask. What are the names of your co-conspirators? You want names? Evelyn, my wife. There's a name. We were 2 months shy of our 12th anniversary. Here's two more... Brian and Evan. My 2 boys, 6 and 8. You freaks killed them, too. Our doctors will assure that you will receive the best medical attention we can provide. I'm Dr. Maita. Let me explain to you how the scours operate. It's a curious little creature. It likes to explore every inch of the human body, from the inside. Its preference is to travel along the nerve lines. The scour enters near the face, and exits via the soft tissue, usually through the reproductive organs. And remember, we are of peace, always. After the John May message, we anticipate resistance members will come out of hiding. As sleeper agents embedded in key positions, you need to be ready. Each of you has one of these in your possession. If you notice any suspicious activity, an assistance will be deployed to your location. Dismissed. Stop. Please. I'll give you the names you want. Pull over here. This is John May's place. Does he know his stepfather was a V? No, May wanted to protect his family. Told 'em nothing. Just a second, guys. You could have told me that the girlfriend was part of the package. What are you talking about? - She's there? Lisa? - <i>Yes.</i> She showed up last night. What is the deal with her? - She seems to know our dirty laundry. - <i>She's a peace ambassador with Tyler.</i> Joe, I'm sorry. I can't get into this right now. I'm having a real hard time with this. All these years, he's been blaming himself,</i> thinking that he's the reason that we broke up, because he went off and crashed his bike. He needs to know the truth. Move it. Godzilla's getting nervous. Can we please not do this right now? I have to go. I will you call you the minute I get a chance. The lies catch up to people, Erica, sooner or later. Tyler needs to know that I'm not his father. You okay? I've never told anyone this. When Tyler was 14, he wrecked his bike, ruptured his spleen. Joe and I went in to donate blood, and... There's supposed to be certain matchups in blood work between parents and their kids. Ours didn't line up. I'm not following. They told us that Joe wasn't Tyler's father. The tests aren't 100% accurate, but... Doctors don't know everything. Joe never believed me. If you don't have trust in relationship, you don't have anything. What does Tyler know? Sometimes you have to lie to people to protect them. Am I talking to the FBI Agent or the mother? You're not supposed to be kicking yet, are you? Hey, honey. Sorry to bother you at work, but... I was wondering if you knew where you put Dr. Pearlman's card. I felt the baby kicking. Give me a call if you get a sec. Thank you. James May? I'm Ryan Nichols. I was a friend of your stepfather. Is it okay if we come in? We need to talk about him. - A friend of ours is in trouble. - James, who is it? Some people that want to talk to me. Well, honey, invite them in. Can I talk with you a few minutes in private? It's urgent. You know what? Why don't I go put on a pot of coffee? I might be able to help. Your friend's here. Good to see you again. It's been, what, a year now? We were just about to sit down and have dinner. I haven't eaten yet. I'll join you. James took red ribbon at the science fair today. - Salt volcano? - Cartesian diver. Cartesian diver. Good job, kiddo. So how'd you two lose touch? Our priorities shifted. What are your plans while you're in town? I came with some old friends to catch up a little. They're coming by later, in fact. They're eager to see John. My family's not familiar with the old gang. Not at all? No. Don't really dwell on the past. There's too much richness in the present. Our pals have already planned to see you, counting on it. You know how they are. They won't leave without at least saying "hello." Tell you what, why don't we meet them out instead? No need to subject Lillie and James to a house full of guests on a school night. Sure. Wouldn't want to inconvenience your family, now would we? I'm not interested in talking about what my stepdad thought, okay? So if you're just here to, I don't know, find closure, then I can tell you what I learned a long time ago. You don't find any. What did your friends want to talk to James about? A family matter. His stepfather? I'm not sure. Our buddy's pretty secretive. You heard about the John May message that went out from the V ships? There's a lot of John Mays in the world. Your stepfather started the resistance against the Vs before anybody even knew they were here. We're part of that resistance now. What resistance? I thought the V's were friendly. You guys are insane. So how did you guys meet? At a restaurant. He was one table over, and he sort of caught my eye. That sounds romantic. So why now? What do you want? John May had a comms device he used to communicate with the resistance. We need that device to contact an ally up there. We're running out of time. Maybe we could raise Mork and Kal-El on the kree omni-wave projector. Look, James, I know it's a lot to wrap your head around. You think? Where did your stepdad keep his things? Boxed up in a storage unit in town. Got tired of looking at his stuff everywhere. Look, man, I'm sure you and my stepdad were friends, You clearly have your cult fantasy thing about how swell of a guy John May was, but you weren't the one he left when he killed himself. That suicide note was fake. - Have you lived here long? - No. I'm from LA, so... - Did you go to school out there? - UCLA. - Great football. You like football? - Oh, yeah. - I love the Trojans. - Me, too. The only problem is, UCLA's team is the Bruins. I meant the Bruins. A shame. Pretty girl like her. God. Storage unit in town. Let's move. Are you with us? Are you with us? Come on. The name you gave us isn't real. Alex Morgan isn't real. She was. She was my unborn daughter. He's stronger than we anticipated. He resisted the scours. You're going about this the wrong way. He can lead us to The Fifth Column. We have to dig deeper than scours. How long had she been like that for? Why was she with me? The V's planted her with you to watch and wait. She wasn't human, Don't sweat it. How did you know my stepdad? - He meant a lot to me. - That's not an answer. Been a lot of that today. Let's slow down. Joshua said it was here somewhere? He said it was in Reedsville. He didn't say it was here. I found it. - What if it doesn't work? - We pray... That Georgie dies quickly. Come on. He's been hiding something. I don't trust him. - That makes two of us. - Just stop! This is about Georgie. Georgie, who's up there right now. - We can't afford mistrust, guys. - Make no mistake. We will save him. We can't lose our way. Get it together. What are you shooting at? I don't know. we better get out before it wakes up. It's that thing from the warehouse raid. A seeker. - Where is it? - I saw something flying over there. Where the hell is it? Does anybody see it? Don't move. How the hell did they find us? Your girl with the claws, Did she give you something? Like a promise ring. The watch. Let's go. - Come on. - Come on. Let's go. - Have you prepared what I asked for? - Yes, it's ready when you are. If we've learned anything, it's that emotion is weakness. Love is the greatest flaw of humans, And our best tool to break them. He says he misses his family. Let's show him his family. Since we couldn't use your memories, We've decided to show you someone else's.</i> Here are the memories of the V, who killed your family. Run. I'm behind you. Get away from me! Don't! Get out of my house!</i> Turn it off! Keep playing it until he tells us what we want to know. Turn it off! Perfect. See? - Pretty easy, right? - Yeah. - I'm thirsty, I'm gonna get sodas. - You want one? - Can I get you one? - Please. Listen, my dad wants me to stay a few weeks. And I'll still see you. Believe me, I really wanna see you. And I know it sucks, but maybe... Maybe this will help fix some stuff. What? I overheard something, But I should say anything. What is it? Just tell me. I can't. It's not my place. Please, just... It's okay. I think your father's lying. About what? I don't think he's really your dad. Come on. That's... That's ridiculous. I overheard him talking to your mom. Sorry. - I shouldn't have said anything. - Hey, guys, here we go. What's wrong? There's a weird mix-up going on here. Lisa just said that she heard you talking to mom, And you said something about you not really being my dad. I don't know. It's crazy. It's true? It can't be. This is me and... And you. It's... it's complicated. Don't you look at her. - You lied. - Wait. Wait, wait, - What, is this why you left mom? - No. I said I couldn't trust her, Ty. What about me? You left me, too, dad. You feel duped for raising somebody else's kid? I love you, Ty, Either way. Please trust that. You need to go talk to your mom about this. Yeah, I will. When I ask to be a part of "Live Aboard". At the healing center, I never thought I'd get picked. I never thought I'd get picked. I've always thought of myself as having bad luck, But this... Why'd you think you had bad luck? When I was 15, I had an appendectomy, and complications left me unable to have children. I mean, I feel blessed for everything that I have. At family reunions, my siblings all have big families. Not under eight kids. Everyone? ... Siblings all have big families. Not under eight kids. Not under eight kids. Everyone? It's huge. Joshua, it's Ryan. You found it. Good. Listen, we have a friend up there. His name is Georgie Sutton. He went up there, and they caught him. I haven't heard anything. He's up there. I need you to find him? I will. Keep the comms device close. Is it true what you said? My stepdad faked that suicide note? Bastard. That man changed my life. Good for you. He changed ours, too. Now listen to me. Your stepfather didn't abandon you. He never had left you if he wasn't forced to. How the hell would you know? Because I'm the one that forced him. - So what have you been doing this year? - Looking for you. No, I mean, what have you experienced in your time here? You never took a drive in the night just to feel the wind in your face? Or had a cold pint on a warm day? Saw a woman who literally took your breath away? No, I think you've been touched, Living among people. Maybe not much, but there's a glimmer. I can see it in your face. You know, the humans... They have an expression they use when they realize what truly matters to them. They say they've found their "true north." Well, I've found mine here, With that woman and that boy. What's that? That's my suicide note. Take a good look at that family in there, am I gonna need it? They're expecting you, John. It's too late. Ten years ago, when I came to your house for dinner... That was the day that I killed John May. You knew and you didn't say anything? - You knew that John May is dead? - No, not just dead. Dead at his hand. Every single day, I wish I could go back and undo what I did, But I can't. All I can say is your stepfather led the way. I've taken risks that you can't even imagine, Because of what he taught me. This fight... Will be brutal beyond anything you've ever seen. And you, too. And John May is our greatest weapon in it. Anna ordered his death. Every single time she sees the message "John May lives," It's like a dagger in her eye. The 5th Column exists because of him. He existed because of you. You and your mother taught him what it's like to be human. He taught me. So if nothing else, I just figured that you should know the truth. No more lies. I feel really stupid forgetting the combination. No, it happens more than you'd think. Let's just see, the model number here. The reset code is... 8-3-3-2-8 pound. Okay, well, I'll... I'll just see myself out then, huh? You convinced a lot of people today. To come live aboard your ships... People like these two. This woman comes from a family with unusually high fertility rates, but she's got a bad luck streak, can't have kids. This guy... brilliant violin player, but a total mess. I looked into our other guests from today's story. Same deal. All so full of potential, But, they're broken toys. This type of person is of great interest to you. The question is... Why? As sophisticated as humans are, you don't see the true value in people. You discard them. I see their inner worth. Every V, regardless of history or luck, or circumstance, receives my care. I'm only showing humans the same regard. I'm not buying it. I don't know exactly what all this means yet, but I'm pretty sure it adds up to something. And if I can get this far in half a day, How far do you think I could get in a month? What do you want? I'll tell you what I don't want. I don't want to be ordinary. If you were ordinary, Mr. Decker, you wouldn't be here. Which is exactly why I'm gonna keep digging into this. And eventually, I'll find enough to run this story. Or you can give me a bigger one. I can protect you. The question is, can we keep helping each other? I think that we'll be helping each other for some time to come. I'm here. How's he doing? He's alive, and <i>he hasn't broken yet.</i> Can you move him? Everyone's being watched too closely right now. But the "Live Aboard" program commences in a few days. I might be able to smuggle him onto an outbound shuttle. Will he last that long? Yes. They'll keep him at the edge of life.</i> Is he conscious? Can he talk? Go ahead. Buddy, how you doing? Been better. You're off the ship? You're safe? I'm safe. - We're all safe. - <i>Good.</i> We're gonna get you out of there. That's what they're waiting for. That's what they want. You come rescue me, you all get caught.</i> Georgie, listen to me. Just give us a few days. Just hang on. I don't have a few more days. You know that. - Let me speak to Jack. - Georgie, please. I need to speak to Jack, Ryan. We're not leaving you up there. It's bigger than me now, father. No, Georgie. Listen to me, hang on. I'll see you around, Jack. Are you sure? I'm ready to see my family now. God... Bless you, George Sutton. God bless you. Make sure they don't track it back to you. John May lives. To Georgie... not in vain. Hey, this is Val, leave a message. Hey, baby. It's me. There's something I need to talk to you about when I get home. I'm not who you think I am. I just feel you should know the truth.</i> No more lies. No more secrets. I just feel you should know the truth. Ty? I always wondered why he left. Deep down, maybe... I even knew... It had to do with me. It didn't, honey. What did dad tell you? I know everything, mom. The tests are wrong. The doctors were wrong. He is your dad. I promise. - Not according to him. - I know. - How could you not tell me? - Because... I was scared you wouldn't believe me, and, I thought if I just kept going, that somebody would tell me that it was a mistake, because it is a mistake. I didn't. I never... I thought that I could always trust you Baby, you can. I was coming home to tell you. - Why should I believe you? - Because it's true. - How can I believe you? - Please, Tyler. Please. It's not true. It's not. It's not true! Honey? Val? George Sutton died. The emotional trauma must have been too intense for him. We did not get any names. "John May lives"... Trite and untrue, but even still, The message The 5th Column sent seems to have produced a groundswell. Let them have this one victory.
