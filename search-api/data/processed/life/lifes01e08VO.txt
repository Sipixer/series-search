Yeah, i worked that case. No dna's gonna tell me we got the wrong guy. You should ask your partner about the bank of l. A. Shootout. That was 15 years ago. You should ask your partner. What happened to all that money. Do you wanna talk about why you're packing books into these boxes? I'm going to need them with me in new york. So i guess i should take off, then. Rachel was in the house. Her bed was unmade. She was there when it happened. Not at a sleepover. We are none of us alone. Even as we exhale, it is inhaled by others.</i> The light that shines upon me Shines upon my neighbor as well. In this way, everything is connected to everything else.</i> In this way, I am connected to my friend even as i am connected to my enemy. In this way, there is no difference between me and my friend. In this way, there is no difference between me and my enemy. We are none of us alone. How come you only call me when someone's dead? Where's all the furniture? Maybe this is all the furniture. He's in the kitchen. What's left of him. He must've been standing at the fridge with the door open when the stove blew. The door protected his top half, but the bottom half... Vaporized. Cut him right in two. Accident or arson? We'll know more when we pull it apart. You get a leak in one of these lines, the gas builds up inside it. Stove is just sitting there like a grenade, waiting to blow.</i> All you need is one spark, and boom. Boom. Edward farthing. That's him, but this house isn't the address he's got listed here. I've got another one. - Another what? - Another i. D. Joseph gale. That's him too. This one's got another address listed. Why does this guy need two i. D. S? Why did he need any i.D.? Seems like he's hardly here at all. Okay, let's just go check out these addresses. Yes, can i help you? Ma'am, my name is detective reese. What's happened? Do you know an edward farthing? - May i help you? - Ma'am, my name is detective crews. The police? Is something wrong? Do you know a joseph gale? Edward is my husband. Why? What's happened? Joseph is my husband. Has something happened? I'm with the widow. Funny you should say that. Transcript: www.yyets.com Synchro: Grischka There was a gas explosion. Where? In cheviot hills. How long have you been married? Five years. I met edward in mammoth, skiing. Double black diamond. He used to compete on the circuit. He liked to go fast. We both liked to go fast. How did it happen? There was a gas explosion. - Where? - In cheviot hills. Okay. I see. Marissa, how long were you and joseph married? Three years. I met joseph at... The richard serra retrospective. He explained the beauty of the oxidation process to me in a way that... it made me cry. Oxidation? You mean rust? If you will. But you should've heard joseph speak about it. We lived a life of the mind. Elena? May i ask what your husband did for a living? What did joseph do for a living? I'm not sure i can tell you that. But it doesn't surprise me that it finally killed him. Why won't you tell me what your husband did for a living? I suppose now that he's dead it's okay. You'll find out soon anyways. I'm sure they'll tell you. Joseph worked for the government, you see. What branch of the government was it that he worked for? He wasn't allowed to tell me what he did. That's how secret it was. Are you saying that your husband was some sort of government agent? Yes. Must've been difficult, living with such a secret man. It was. Because of his... his job, he would have to go away for long periods of time. And there were phone calls in the middle of the night. They left him very upset sometimes. You must have worried for his safety. I worried all the time. But it was for the good of the country.</i> The sacrifice i made by my husband being absent Was nothing compared... compared to what it... But it wasn't just the time away. It made him forgetful. And confused, and... sometimes... sometimes he forgot where he was. And who he was. You must have loved him very much. I did. He was kind, generous. He was funny. and... gentle. He did what no other man... i've ever met did. What was that? He listened to me. He listened to me. When can i claim my husband's body? Soon. Okay, on the long shot that he is some kind of agent, Let's send his prints to the government database. Well, expect a "neither confirm nor deny the existence of" letter. Okay, so we have one dead guy married to two women. - Half a dead guy. - Half a dead guy. If either wife found out about the other one, that'd be cause for murder. If both of them found out, Maybe they killed him together. - That's your theory? - It makes sense. Yeah, that's why i'm surprised it's your theory. What did you expect me to say? That they seemed like they both loved him. Marissa seemed like she did. And from what you say, so did elena. They didn't seem like the kind of women that could kill someone. Well, marissa didn't seem it. And from what you say, neither did elena. But you still think they're good for it. Do you want to know what the chinese symbol for "war" is? Just when i thought i was at the part where i'd get an answer. - I don't have to tell you. - No, tell me. What{\, crews, what}? - Not if you don't want me to. - No, please{\, crews}. Tell me what the chinese symbol for "war" is. The chinese symbol for "war"... is two women under one roof. He told both wives he was a secret government agent? Guess if you're gonna lie, lie big. When we told the wives where he died, they didn't believe it. Like cheviot hills was some kind of agency cover-Up. Both wives have alibis. Marissa was at her gallery. Elena was at an indoor rock climbing class. We can't find any record of either of them knowing each other. Or knowing about each other. We canvassed every house on the block. Showed pictures of both women. No one remembers seeing either of them. Who lives like this? Everything all right? Imagine being married to two different women. Okay, i'll play. Are they hot? Yeah, i guess so. - You're imagining it, aren't you? - Yes. As it turns out, i am. How's it working out for you? Not so bad. Not so bad until the part where they blow you up with the stove. I... don't know what that means. You tell each of them a different lie. Well, don't all husbands lie to their wives? When i was married, all i ever did was lie. Didn't you? No. - What did you lie about? - Well, you... you know. About the girls, and... what happened on the private jets. And what happened with the girls on the private jets. No, this guy didn't lie like that. He didn't lie to be away from them. He lied to be with them. Maybe we should get some furniture in here. Report came back from arson. The pilot light was rigged. Someone turned that stove into shrapnel. The phone logs on the wives show no contact between them. Davis. We've got an officer down. Where? Right here in the building's parking structure. Excuse me. Thank you. Wasn't there another suspect in the seybolt killings?</i> Are you removing me from duty? The lead detective on the case that sent you to prison for 12 years Just turned up shot to death. I was sitting here with you when it happened. That doesn't mean you weren't involved. Do you think i was involved? If this were your case, would you be a suspect? If this were my case? I'd be right at the top of my list. Are you removing me from duty? No. But expect a visit from i.A.D. I always do. Detective? I am going to be handling this case personally. You still have your gun and badge. Yeah, but if you're looking to get reassigned to a new partner, Now is probably the moment. We got a hit off of half-Man's prints. His name was rudolph farthingale. Farthingale? Edward farthing, joseph gale. Farthingale. Came off the government database. - He did work for the government. - Yeah. But not exactly as a spy. Rudolph farthingale worked for the i.R.S.? Yep. Looks like we just opened up our field of suspects. I mean, who doesn't want to kill the taxman, right? How long did mr. Farthingale work here? 12 years. Did he ever talk about his personal life? No, he kept to himself. But... i always had a feeling he lived a very tame home life. He was just so... - Ordinary? - Yes He was the most ordinary man i think i've ever met. And shy. He could hardly look a woman in the eye.</i> He didn't have a wife, did he? No, he didn't have a wife. Has this always been his cubicle? Yes. Has it been cleaned lately? No, no. Mr. Farthingale always kept it like this. He was very exact. No photos? Nothing personal. What was his job here? Mr. Farthingale was in tax evasion. He'd go after people who didn't pay their taxes? Go after? No. We have field agents for that. Mr. Farthingale would scan and collate records, Identify non-Taxpaying citizens, And then flag them for the field agents. He never left his cubicle? He seemed to like it that way. Well, we'll need a list of the people that he identified as tax evaders. And why would you want that? Maybe one of them killed mr Farthingale. Taxman isn't exactly a well-Liked figure. That would be impossible. Impossible for one of them to kill him? Impossible for one of them to even know who he was. Mr. Farthingale was assigned an identification number. That's what appears in the reports, not his name. Just a number. Detective crews. I.A.D.? No, no. Not exactly. John garrity. I'm your union rep. I just came by to talk to your lieutenant,</i> But i thought i'd introduce myself. - Good to meet you, john. - Yeah, you too. I'll be with you when you're in with i.A.D. Yeah, okay. You can also have a lawyer if you want one. - My lawyer's out of town. - We can get you another one. No, i think i'll be okay. Listen. Off the record, Some guy puts me away for 12 years, I'd take him out too. But i think i'd wanna do it myself. Hi, it's constance. Please leave a message.</i> Hey, connie. I know you're in new york. But you know that guy you told me to stay away from? He ended up dead. So call me, okay? Do you want to know if i was involved in ames'death or not? No. My union rep said He wouldn't blame me if i did do it. He said that, did he? Off the record. Then i guess it doesn't count. I'd rather not go back to prison. I can understand that. Rudolph farthingale. Born in shaker heights, ohio, 1973, "B" studenent in high school, "b" student in college, Got an 83% on his civil service exam. No criminal record. No speeding tickets. No parking tickets. Worked in tax evasion processing for the i.R.S. Since 1995. Yeah, he was a real bland guy. Except for the fact that he had two wives And he ended up getting fragged by an exploding kitchen oven. Do you think he felt any pain? I wouldn't think so. And this was some kind of safe house? Is that what they call it? Hello. Elena. This is marissa gale. Marissa, this is elena farthing. May i ask why we're here? Yes, what's going on? Well... marissa's husband was killed yesterday. Killed here. I'm so sorry. My husband-- He was killed yesterday too. Is that why we're here together? Did they work together at-- Well, at that place my husband worked? Your husband worked there too? Ladies, Both your husbands were... killed here. Yesterday at the same time. But... But what, detective? There was only one person here. How could there have been only one person here? Did your husband have to suddenly go out of town For a week or two? Did your husband get strange phone calls in the middle of the night? Sometimes forget where he was? Sometimes forget who he was? - Are you saying-- - We were both married-- To-- To the same man. Yes. He wasn't a spy. He was a fraud. But i believed him. I... waiting up for him Because he was working on a big case. Yeah, he told you that too? How he was tracking someone? How he was not looking for the person not obeying the law. No, that's not what he said. He said he was looking for the person not not obeying the law. Joseph said He was not looking for the person not obeying the law. Edward said he was looking for the person not not obeying the law. Ladies... his real name was rudolph farthingale. He worked at the i.R.S. I... i... i don't think i have a reaction for this. I do. I'm going home and smash everything he owned. He was not looking for the person not obeying the law. He was looking for the person not not obeying the law. That kind of talk remind you of anyone? Rudolph farthingale Wanted to be a spy so badly. Don't you think? He stumbled upon something, someone, - that got him killed? - Or... Was he just one of those people that sees conspiraces everywhere. This is what we were afraid of. When we partnered you with crews, i asked you to help me get him removed from duty. For his own good, and for the department's good. Yeah, i remember that. He's done some good police work, dani. I won't deny that. But here we are. We were afraid crews was back to get even. Now ames is dead. He's not gonna let himself go back to prison.</i> He's capable of anything now. He's got nothing to lose. Connie. You really should lock your door. Well, some doors i lock, and some i don't. So you got my message? About ames? Already knew. The d. A.'S office told me. They told you because you're my lawyer? I'm not your lawyer anymore, charlie. I know. I know what we said, but... i.A.D. Told me to get a lawyer. Who else am i gonna trust on this, connie? The d. A.'S office told me last week. But ames died yesterday. They called me about a job. You? Working for the d. A.? I took it. Well, they've been after you for years. Why now? Because. The cudahy thing got to me. Because most of my clients aren't like you, charlie. Most of my clients, the high-Priced ones The firm assigned me, they're guilty. How does your husband feel About coming back from new york early? My husband is gonna stay there for a while. He needs it. We both need it. Why are you here, connie? Because i start with the d. A.'S office tomorrow. And the next time i see you, It'll be on official business, so... i need you to listen to me, charlie. Okay? The d.A.'S office wants you really bad for ames'death. And you just-- You need to watch yourself. And you really should lock your door. What'd she mean, You need to watch yourself? A week before ames died, The d. A. Took my lawyer from me. Initial internal affairs inquiry with charles crews, detective, lapd. Detective crews, what were your feelings towards carl ames? My feelings toward ames were the same as my feelings toward anyone. And that would be? That none of us are alone. That even as we exhale, it is inhaled by others. Is that some kind of joke? Well, laughter is the best medicine. Reader's digest. I had a subscription at pelican bay. Detective crews, you were seen arguing in a bar with ames. Would that be connected to his death? The light that shines upon me shines upon my neighbor as well. What is that supposed to mean? That in this way, everything is connected to everything else. Who did he piss off to get himself killed like that? Farthingale. Someone rigged his stove. Someone wanted him dead bad. Someone's still out there. You still got your head in the farthingale case? - I do. - <i>Okay.</i> So... What's your head thinking? My head is thinking that we need to know more about what farthingale's head was thinking. But how do we do that? No one knew him. It was just farthing and gale. Farthingale split himself in two. Let's put him back together. We know his wives didn't do it. Maybe they could tell us who did. Okay, so... what are we looking for? The points of connection. And what would those look like? Gale was here, Farthing was there. But farthingale was also in both places. We need to find farthingale. So we're not looking for how they were different. We're looking for how they were the same. We find that, we find farthingale. What kind of music did joseph listen to? Modern jazz. What kind of music did edward like? Classic rock. What kind of tv did he watch? Sports mostly. Oh, joseph never watched tv. Scrambled. Poached. Flat. Sparkling. Top. Bottom. - Boxers. - Briefs. Right side of the bed. Left side of the bed. But he was a light sleeper. But he was a light sleeper. And what did he used to do when he couldn't sleep? He would sit in that chair. Just sre and stare. Almost meditating. Which chair would he sit in? That one. He'd just sit and stare. Totally zoning out (????). What do you see? A fireplace. What else do you see? A picture of farthingale and elena. A model boat. A duck decoy. A fishing pole. Five baseball caps. How many? How many caps? Five. Why? What do you see? Five bottles of wine. Anything? You got two national pastimes. Baseball and drinking. This is what he liked to do when he couldn't sleep. When you can't sleep, what do you think about? I don't have a problem sleeping. Work. When i can't sleep, i think about work. He worked for the i.R.S. Farthingale worked for the i.R.S. Farthing and gale were spies. And they would sit here and meditate on these objects. All right. Five baseball caps from minor league teams. And five bottles of wine. This is ridiculous. This is what he did. You see something, don't you? No, it's ridiculous. What are the years on those bottles? '93,'97, '99, 2002, and 2004. That's really odd. 1993... bakersfield post office. 1997... lancaster police station. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, 1999... modesto-- - Courthouse. - Courthouse. 2002, Stockton hall of records. 2004-- Visalia city hall. Those are the years these places were bombed. Free state bombings. - Free state bombings? - Oh, you have been away. Free state. He's a-- He's an antigovernment whack job. He calls himself free state. Pulls a bombing every few years And then he goes back into hiding. Never been caught. Until now. You think this i.R.S. Clerk, Rudolph farthingale, did what hundreds of federal agents have failed to do? Free state was a bomber. Someone blew up farthingale's stove. Let me have those years, please. 1993,'97, '99, 2002, and 2004. Nothing. There's no entry in mr. Farthingale's Tax evasion files that have those dates as a key. What did the wives say? He was not looking for someone not obeying the law?</i> He was looking for the guy not not obeying the law. He was not looking for the guy not obeying the law. Will he... just keep saying that? Was farthingale tracking someone who was paying their taxes? Well, i can't imagine why He would track someone who was paying his taxes.</i> Could you check anyway for me? He was not not obeying the law. He was not not paying his taxes. Free state lives off the grid, but he comes back on every few years. Pays taxes when he needs to earn money,</i> Rent cars, buy supplies. Nothing. But if you wanted to establish credit in a certain year, you'd have to file taxes The year before. So we should check one year before each attack. '92,'96,'98, '01,'03. Leonard slatz. Mr. Slatz is not a tax evader. I mean, not consistently so. He won't pay taxes for a few years, and then he'll file</i> And then he won't pay again. That's why he wasn't listed in mr. Farthingale's evasion file. He was not not paying. How would farthingale get hold of something like this? Oh, you would have to look for some kind of a statistical anomaly Or something that didn't belong In the tax database, but the patience to do that, It's thousands of hours. Did slatz pay his taxes last year? Yes, he did. He's preparing for another attack. Do you have an address listed for mr. Leonard slatz? Yes, but it's a post office box. Okay. P.O. Box was emptied out two days ago. Some creepy guy rolls up in an r. V., closes out the account, no forwarding address. Farthingale got close. - Hello. - Charlie. Hey, how was your first day as a d. A.? Go home. - What? - Go home, charlie. Go home now. Hey! It's kind of like a party, except, This is my house, and i don't remember sending out the invites. Detective crews, in that you're a person of interest In the killing of carl ames, The district attorney's office has issued a search warrant For these premises, as well as the occupants therein. Don't you wish you could talk that way? They seem pretty serious, charlie. We are serious, detective, So let's just get this over with. It's locked. Is it? Do you have a key? I had a key. Do you knowhere is? Do you know what happened? I left the key in there. Then i locked the door with the key inside, so.</i> In order to unlock the door, i need to get the key, But i can't get the key unless i unlock the door. It's a puzzle. Break it down. ****. Let's go. You took it all? I was looking for porn. Your lawyer called. Said the cops were coming to serve a search warrant. If there was anything you wouldn't want found... how did you get in the door? Charlie, you weren't the only one to spend time in prison. I learned some things in there too. How did you know what was in there? I didn't exactly. But something else i learned in prison, charlie: ****. Crews? Are you okay? The feds are gonna try to figure out where free state is going next. But edward farthing and joseph gale already knew that. They followed him. They got too close. - And that's what got 'em killed. - No. No. Crews, that's what got him killed. There was no farthing. There was no gale. It was just one man. Farthingale. One person split in two. Both needing the same thing. Both needing to be a hero. Both needing to find slatz. And both... both an i.R.S. Agent. Both farthing and gale saved all their receipts. So you find a place where farthing and gale both went. "You are what you receipt." Both farthing and gale ate over and over at this place. We wanna find slatz, we follow farthing and gale. Dandy's fast foods? Yeah, i can't see intellectual farthing</i> or health nut gale eating at dandy's fast foods - for the food. - So let's go see why they-- why he went there. Well, we have one thing farthingale didn't have When he went after slatz. Yeah, what's that? Farthingale's death. What did the guy at the post office box place say? Some guy closed out the account yesterday. And what was he driving? An r. V. Cops? We're detectives reese and crews. - We're looking for-- - Leonard slatz. That's right. Figures. Yeah? Why's that? Because that crackpot was always going off About the government this, the government that. Knew it was just a matter of time before someone came to take him away. - Is he here? - Nope. Took off two days ago. Left me with an empty slot and a month of unpaid rent and utility fees. He did leave a few boxes behind. You want me to go get 'em? No. No, i think it'd be better if you let us go get 'em. Suit yourself. Come on back. Right over here. Reese, don't move! I think i'm gonna back away now. Yeah, i think that'd be a good idea. Get down! Get down! I will shoot you. He wants to shoot you. Leonard slatz, You're under arrest. For opposing an unjust government? For asserting my naturally given free will? No, you're under arrest for the murder Of rudolph farthingale. He was one of us, leonard. We don't like it when you kill one of us. You know, i get that farthingale was half physical, half intellectual. And farthing and gale, the field agent, the analyst. But... Why two wives? I guess neither of them wanted to be alone. You're not going to ames'funeral? Probably not a good idea. Probably not. How are you holding up? 'Bout ready? Yeah. Crews, this is my father. Jack reese. Charlie crews. - Of course. I know who you are. - Of course. Let's go, dani. I don't wanna be late for carl's funeral. All right. We are none of us alone. Even as we exhale, it is inhaled by others. The light that shines upon me shines upon my neighbor as well. In this way, everything is connected to everything else.</i> In this way, i am connected to my friend even as i am connected to my enemy. In this way, there is no difference between me and my friend. In this way, there is no difference
