You want to sleep with my wife. No, I want to sleep with my wife. Ex-wife. You asked my husband permission to have sex with me? They want me to tell you, jack, you go back a long way. But not for nothing. Life Season02 Episode04 Not For Nothing</font> They want me to tell you, jack, you go back a long way. But not for nothing, there was six. There is five. There could just as easily be four. - That sounds like a, uh-- - wire tap. Legal wire tap? A not legal wire tap. A not legal wire tap on-- a not legal wire tap on jack reese. They want me to tell you, jack-- that's not jack reese's voice though. Who is that? You don't know. Back a long way. But not for nothing, there was six. There is five. There could just as easily be four. It was six, it is five, but it could just as easily be four? What does that mean? You--you're trying to figure that out. Okay, I'm just gonna listen now. Just--I'm just listening. It's your phone. Your phone, charlie. You gonna get that? You want me to get it? I'm gonna get it. Hello? Okay. Okay. That was your partner. She says there's a dead guy. She wants to know if you'd like to, uh, catch who killed him. All the prisoners and guards are accounted for. No one is missing. So the killer is still here. Can we just go home? Kinda freaky deeky. Huh, john? Oh, yeah. Kind of freaky deeky. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly presents</font> -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> Crédits Hey, you know what this reminds me of? Would that be a prison? No, but yeah. 'Cause of the cells and everything. But what it really reminds me of is a horror movie, you know? You know, like maybe that one with the haunted spaceship. Where that freakin' gooey head pops right out of her-- - bobby. - Yeah, charlie. - Murder weapon? - Haven't found it yet. I'm back looking for it. "Freakin' gooey head?" He was just asking if I was okay. And I am. It's a crime scene. And we are detectives. Then let us detect. You have to let me in. You don't understand. You have to let me in! Warden's here. It ryan really dead? I saw him but I thought I can't be true. How did you see him? From my home computer. I was on a break. I saw ryan. Even on the computer, I could see all the blood. - His throat had been slashed. - With what? We haven't found the murder weapon. No sharp objects were allowed. Nothing that could be used as a weapon. I was very careful. This has never happened before. You've done this before? A few times, yes. Others do it as well. There's a standard protocol. Others? Social psychologists. The prison experiment? You've read about it. Something like that. I recruited 20 students? I didn't know them. They didn't know each other. I randomly assigned them roles of inmates and guards. Ryan sagel was a guard. You said you were observing? How did you not see the murder. There were built-in blackouts. No more than 60 seconds. After a blackout, the lights came on. And I saw ryan holding his throat. But something was different this time. Wasn't it, professor? Something happened down there in that blackout to those kids. Someone died, professor. I'd like to go down there now to see it. - Would that be okay? - Sure. We'll take you down there. You know what this reminds me of? let's get some sunlight in here. Anything on the murder weapon? Wellsy, we're a little light today. There's only four of us and two gotta stay in the hallway with the kids here. Which only leaves two to perform the search. Well, we don't have that much time. Well, we could put the kids in a cell. Or not. Detectives' choice. What is this? It's a piano crate. We searched it. No weapon. Also, no piano. They didn't need the piano, bobby. Just the crate it came in. They must've used it for solitary. Yeah, I guess. Modern education and all. When I was at community college, we made due with beer bongs. Where's halliday? Step away from that computer, professor. Something happened down here. I have to find out what it was. This is not an experiment anymore, professor. This is a crime scene now. And everything on that computer, that's part of the crime scene too. There were eight cameras. Thousands of hours of footage. I can be a help going over it. All right, I'm gonna call the station, get the geeks out here. Sit down, please. Why don't you quit acting stupid, man. Put it on your head. It's the real prison experience, right? Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna try to get you out of here as soon as possible. But for the meantime, we do have an investigation to conduct. So you're all just gonna have to stay put. Is that the law? Yeah, it's the law. hell, yes! Very well said, milady. Excellent speech. Who wants to go home anyway? - You ready? - Ready ready. Had a little chat with the dean. They're all lawyered up. In two hours, this thing's over. It was a locked basement, so whoever killed ryan sagel is still here. You got two hours with those kids. After that, they get legal representation and counseling, killer or no. Make sure it's not no. To wit, find a murder weapon. It's a locked basement. It's gotta be there. We could use some more uniforms to help out with the search. And a few bodies from tech support too. We got three, count 'em, three parades today. Little ethiopia, armenia, and osaka. I got no one. - And how's your day going, captain tidwell? - What? Well, thanks for asking, detective. As we speak, I got an off-duty north hollywood detective being brought in for discharging his weapon in a bar down the block. And here's the kicker. I think he's crying. Abby. I need abby. Is that his pistoli? Secure it. Call his partner. His partner's on the way. I just want my abby. Who's abby? My wife. Leaving me. That's the first time I said it out loud. Wife number? One... and only. I just want her back. I got this, guys. Yeah, the first one's the toughest. That's the one that usually leaves you. Let me show you something. Mia. Carly. Jasmine. Number three usually has a name like that. Amber, jasmine, jade. You'll see. Point is, all magnificent women. Insane, soul-crushing, magnificent women. I want my abby. - I just want her back. - Of course you do. But she's your first wife. First wives are like chicken pox. You gotta go through 'em when you're young. If you wait till you're older, you wind up sterile. excuse me. Are you weepy's partner? Yeah, I'm the partner. - Do I know you? - You don'T. Can we talk? Thanks. I just got someone to come down about the video. Tidwell said he had no one. Oh, I know a guy. You know a guy. A guy who knows computers and prisons. What are the odds? Oh, that fella that lives in your garage. Ted is on parole and he lives in a room above the garage. And if he comes down here, don't bring that stuff up. He's very sensitive about it. Well, I do pretty darn well with the ladies. In liberty city. Grand theft auto. I'm a chem major. Been a big ten days. It seems longer. - Chem major? - Yes, sir. Then how come you signed up for a psych experiment? Money. $83 a day. What were your dealings with ryan sagel? You mean with destro? That's what we called him. Destro. Okay, well... what were your dealings with correctional officer destro? He did his thing and I did mine. He was a C. O. You were an inmate. And if you called him destro, then he must've been-- must've been what?Brutal? Like I said, he did his thing. How do you feel about him being murdered, will? To be honest, I have no feelings about it one way or the other. Man... it's pretty messed up, huh? There's not gonna be a test, right? It's just hanging out down there for five days, no books. Hey, I'm still getting credit for this though, right? I'm a poetry major. When I fill in the occupation line on the forms, I write poet. But... I don't know. I feel like other people should say whether I'm a poet or not, you know? Not me. You were a guard down here? Uh, correctional officer. But you were a poetry major up there, tate. Destro kick you around because you were a poet? What are you kidding, dude? Destro was my brother. - I'd like you to take it easy there. - You know what, sweetie? I would like you to show my boy destro the respect he deserves and find his killer. Exactly what kind of poetry are you majoring in there, tate? You in the same frat as destro? I was a pledge. And it's "fraternity." Whole word. You wouldn't call your country a-- I thought they said that subjects didn't know each other before the experiment? You lied to me, didn't you? You corrupted this? You did this? Did you do this, tate? Let me make it simple for you. You're cops. We're correctional officers. Us. One of those pieces of garbage out there killed my boy D. Them. There's us and there's them. You did this! It was you! Okay, you need to both lower your voices now-- there's us and there is them! Lower your voice now. There is us and there is them! crews! - This is how it starts. - How what starts? Halliday! Halliday! Halliday! Halliday! Halliday! Step away from the door, professor. Don't open the door. I'm not asking you gain,professor. - Got him? - Yeah, I got him. Calm down! Calm down! Prison break? Yeah, I think we lost one. These kids sure do learn fast. - now. Go. - Move. No fun being the warden, huh, warden? It's professor. They just threw this at me. I don't even know what it is, but they threw it at me. - Oh, please don't-- - do that. - Nutriloaf. - Nutri what? Nutriloaf. Engineered to have no flavor. Prison system uses it to punish people who had everything else taken away from them. Deprive them of flavor. Get this kids some pizza. And some fruit. You want me to go and get it? - Bobby. - I'm on it, charlie. Maybe we should get some buffalo wings too, huh? Spicy? You have one escapee. Janice. An inmate. All right, contact campus security. Get text alerts with her descriptions sent out to the student body. Wherever she's going, she's not going far with everyone looking for her. We have the killer right here. Tate. He lied. He's got serious issues. Something must've happened between him and ryan. I'd like to question him. Oh, that's not gonna happen. Bobby, keep an eye on tate. You're the warden now. With the murder weapon, prisoners are good at hiding things. Yeah, well, some of them are guards, charlie. No, they aren'T. I believe in cartoons, french fries. Kissing my boyfriend. Uh, random acts of kindness. Kittens. And, uh, the films of mr. Adam sandler. And you haven't seen janice? Not for five glorious days. What did she do? Are you here to, like, give her an award? Yeah, something like that. She likes the moose. She is the moose. Does all the games. I forgot to put "no collegiate costume mascots" on my roommate info sheet. So now I live with mitchtopher moose. "Bw," new boyfriend? I don't pay attention. It's kind of like hello kitty ate the disney channel and threw it up onto that side of the room. Janice use email? No, she rocks the telegraph, there will be blood style. Um, don't you need a warrant for that? Oops. Bad balance. Inner ear thing. Ben wise. Ben wise. Do you know where ben wise lives? Off-campus with his parents. How does she make it across campus without being seen? Reese. in his parents' bedroom? Where we used to go? Where he used to take me? - You we myorst nightmare come true! - Hey, what's going on? - My worst nightmare! - All right, cool it. My worst nightmare. You're not gonna charge him? You want me to charge your partner? I want you to uphold the law. Look, the job does a number on your life. Once in a while, your life gets to do a number on the job. But it's always something with henry. Yeah, like what? Like that. Can you handle the setup? Operationally or, uh, emotionally? Charlie wanted you to see what happened the day before the murder. Any blow-ups, arguments, such like. These kids really killed someone, huh? Well, one of 'em surely did. in rahway state penitentiary I shot a man who was mean to me. He wouldn't let me drink my tea and took away my cookies. I'll tell you, sir. All this... has really shown me how important the police are. Thinking about law enforcement myself. And what are you looking to get into. Lapd. Straight up, sir. Is that so? Janice escapes just so she can yell at a cheerleader? Hard to believe she slit anybody's throat. My money's on the frat boy. Our poet, tate. Tate did lie to us about knowing destro. Tate had a severe reaction when we mentioned destro's name. I think we should find out more about those two frat brothers. Let's go to the frat. Let's go to the frat. We need to ask you some questions about a frat pledge.His name is tate-- no, no--no names. Pledges have no names. Yo, pledge. What's your name, pledge? We took his name. And if he's lucky, we'll give it back to him. Pledge, show these officers out. Uh, you're not gonna help us? Oh, kind of like how you helped us get our charter suspended? Hell no. Erthe's us... and there's them! I think you might want to help us. And why's that? - You want the short answer or the long answer? - Short. Because. Okay, the long. Because I am about three seconds from deciding that I just do not like you. Look, how may I help you officers? - You can tell us about tate mcneil. - Tate who? He's a pledge here. I don't know anybody by that name. I know you had no pledge named tate because the pledges have their names taken away. But when the pledges get their names back, will any of those names be the name Tate ? yo, officer riddler, there's all our pledges. And your boy tate ain't one of 'em. If tate's not a pledge, then who is he? Not us and not them. Pizza man! Pizza man! You're a lifesaver, pizza man. Hey, hold on a minute. You still there? Charlie, where are you? I'm in, uh--on the job. Look, uh, jen. I understand about your husband. I, uh, I shouldn't have done that. I--I shouldn't have gone to him like that. You know, sometimes I do things, you know? I know. Yeah, well, he punched me and you slapped me. Maybe we're even. Maybe. Look, charlie, I got a call from a reporter about an hour ago. Said he was doing a story on you. He wanted to ask you questions? Just one question, charlie. About your time in prison. What is the question, jen? He wanted to know is it true that when that lawyer came to visit you in prison, and she told you she wanted to prove your innocence that you sent her away and went back to your cell. Is that true, charlie? You didn't want to be free? What did you say? I told him to go to hell. Officer stark says you're thinking about a future in the lapd. Yeah, thinking about it. Since when? Ever since officer stark got given the keys to those cells. You a tau sig, tate? Well, there's us and there's them. Turns out you're neither. What was that for? You know what to do with that towel, tate. Destro was strong. You said you were a frat brother. Officer stark holds the keys and suddenly you want to be a cop? That's how the weak survive. Destro's dead. You know what to do with that towel, tate. Destro reall wasa tau sig. What did he do when he saw what you drew on your leg? Did he laugh at you? Never showed it to him. I knew he'd make me take it off. I drew it for me. Like you said, I'm weak. There's something you two need to see. I'm gonna find out who brang this crap in. A few days in, a bag of contraband shows up. Candy bars, energy drinks, kettle corn. Ryan says perry did it and he's gonna put perry in the hole for two days. Perry denies the charges. Destro, I didn't do it! - Oh, you didn't do it? - No! Right before they put perry in the hole, will steps forward. And will goes into the hole. - Don't! - What did you say? It was me. I planted that bag. It was me. That's you? but if no one was going in and out of here, neither will nor perry could've planted that bag. So where did it come from? Must've come from you. It was placed to heighten the dynamic. - Part of the protocol? - Yes. But there was nothing in it that could kill a man. Nothing. And will goes in the hole for something he didn't do. pal, hey, let's not get crazy here. She is your first wife. Put my gun back in the drawer. I love her. Always loved her. Henry, the desk you're sitting at, it used to be mine. That's how I know you. This extremely professional and sensitive individual who equates women with viral infections took a job I worked my entire life for. That hurt. Probably about as much as you're hurting now. You have no idea how much I hurt. I do. I've been there. Standing on the brooklyn bridge, wondering what it's all about. After coming home and finding most of your life has left for jersey. I know that pain. But I also know something that dulls it. Tullamore dew, the afghan whigs, and many, many, many strippers. You... shut the hell up! Captain. We're taking a side bar, henry. His wife is a stripper. He went with a stripper for his first wife? She was the best thing that ever happened to me. you took the heat for perry. You went in the hole for something that you didn't do. Why? Why do you think? People go in the hole for protection. To get safe. Because they think it's better to be alone than to live in constant fear. I went because it wasn't fair. I went because perry didn't do it. But why you, will? Why not me? You think this is all part of the experiment. Come on. You're too hot to be a cop. From the theater department, right? You were in pippin. Man, this is so truly and utterly awesome. Was it part of the experiment when they dragged you toward the hole? It was just a snag. I have a little problem with small spaces. Did the guards know you have a problem with small spaces. No. Why would I tell them that? Destro had his frat friends take ben out. And hooked him up with that cheerleader. I saw photos. Destro showed it to me on his phone. Did you ever tell destro or the other guards about your boyfriend? No. I kept that safe. Inside me. Seeing those photos, it was my worst nightmare. Her worst nightmare. It came true. Perry's too. On that haunted spaceship, is this the part where people's nightmares come true? No. That's a different part. You smell that? I can smell a lot of things. Burning plastic. What is that? It's the murder weapon. Let's send this out for prints. It's a shank. Melted plastic scraped to a point. How would they melt it? I didn't find any matches. Yellow fingertips? You been smoking during the experiment? Show us where. you snuck up here to smoke. Yeah. We weren't supposed to though. Michelle, that lighter makes you a suspect. You understand that? I'm in jail so I must've done something. I didn't kill ryan. Anybody see you smoking? Now I'm supposed to give up somebody else. 8195 saw me. Will. He didn't tell on me. - I don't get it. - What don't you get? - We were awful to him. - We? All of us guards. What did you do? Terrible things. Horrible things. Will begged us to stop and we just... we just laughed. Why would I do that? Why would you do that, michelle? Why would you do that to will? Destro told us halliday wanted will broken. Destro said halliday said to do whatever it took. Destro said if we broke will, then-- then you've won? You did it during the blackouts, didn't you? Waited until it was dark. You think you hurt worse than davis does? Worse than me? I know I do. You don't understand. Well, I know when my first wife split, I wanted to die. Davis? When they busted me down, the thought crossed my mind. - So why don't you just do it? - Captain tidwell. Fine. I'm gonna. You think I won't do it, huh? This is the last time that I am gonna let life kick me in the teeth. I saw this in a movie once. That's a whole lot of talk, henry. Why don't you do in yourself, man?'Cause I got stuff to do. So either pull the trigger and let me get a cleaning crew in here, or get the hell out of my office. It's all right. She was the best thing that ever happened to me. No, she wasn'T. She was the first. No bullets. I don't leave loaded guns lying around. - Then why did we-- - because sometimes a guy's just gotta talk. And I didn't take your job. I took a job. I was just saying that for dramatic effect. I found this under one of my desk drawers. You got a nice-lookin' family. Now I know you. Now you do. You sure? As a matter of fact I am. I can tell for sure where several of the students were when the lights went off. Will was locked in the hole. He could not have done it. All right, you're going in. Get in there. Oh, my god! Thanks for taking your time, warden. It's professor. You've been holding back on us. About will. What about will? About what you asked destro to do to will. "Whatever it took?" Is that what you told destro, professor warden? I never said that. You told destro that if he broke will, then he'd won. Whatever it took. Is that the protocol? To tell one of your guards to break a student? I didn't do that. I would never do that. The guards took some initiative, yes. But I was just an observer. I would never get involved. I would never let it get personal. Because that's the protocol? Yes. And that's not what you do. Please hold. Hey, jen. It's me again. That reporter that called with that question. He leave his number? Blocked, huh? Yeah, thought so. Hey, I had that number traced. I texted it over to you. Yeah, yeah, I'm a cop. I can do that. Hey, jen, listen. Do me a favor. After I hang up, go ahead and give that guy a call. Just tell him I said hi. You know who I am, don't you? Knew it from the first time you saw me. What with you being a social psychologist and all. And me, well... me being me. You called my ex-wife? You called to talk to her about me? About my time in prison? Aren't you gonna get that? I thought you were an observer. Thought you didn't get involved. You trying to break me? Is that it? My worst nightmare. Keeping me from doing my job. What were you trying to stop me from doing? Professor warden, you keep trying to get to that computer. Maybe you want to tell us what it is you're looking for. I don't know what you're talking about. You wanna rethink that? I think I'd like to have someone from the university come down here now please. Detective reese, would you mind stepping out and dealing with that? What is this? I guess you'd call it an education. You studied charlie's case. So you must know what happened to that guard when he was in there. You must also know that they never found out who did it. Sometimes in prison, people get hurt. No one knows how it happened. Like I said. It's an education. Maybe you want to show us what you don't want us to see out there. What did you think would happen when you gave me their personal files? What did you want to happen? Take their fears and use it against 'em? - That's what you said! - Ryan, calm down. Take their weaknesses and use it against them! That's what you said! Congratulations, doc. Your experiment, it's a success. 'Cause now you're afraid too. Whatever it takes. And now you're weak! And now you, doc, are getting out of my prison. Get out of my prison! I like the part where he says you gave him their personal files. Destro took over your prison and you didn't call for help? That was part of the experiment. I also like the part where he says, "you said 'whatever it takes.'" You made destro and then you left those kids alone with him. Congratulations. You're not a killer. You're a coward. I never said ouey cldn't leave. And the door to this prison was always unlocked. They couldn't walk out because they accepted the idea they were supposed to be in here. I never locked anything. You don't need locks for a prison. Just prisoners. Officer stark. Yeah, what's up, charlie? Why don't you go ahead and cuff professor warden halliday here. What? What is this? I would imagine it's incitement to gross bodily harm. Seven years for each count. I count 20 students. That's 140 years. Maybe, if you're well-behaved, you'll get out after 120. Look, detectives. I'm no detective, but I gotta ask. Who exactly is the killer? If none of it was locked, then we don't know if will really stayed in here during the blackouts. Then where did he get the weapon? You said it was melted plastic. Where'd he get the plastic? halliday's full of crap. The kid's a hero. He was trying to show them that they couldn't break him. No. Will wanted to be in that hole again for a reason. okay, there. Right there. See the plastic bag there? Fast-forward. Stop. The bag's gone. Keep going. I didn't say you could take it off. So why don't you put it back on? Will could've left the hole during one of the black outs and no one would've known that he was gone. And he knew michelle was smoking upstairs. So he snuck out, made the shank out of the plastic bag. He accepted that he was a convict. I guess I'm a convict too. Yeah, why's that? Ted still thinks will is a hero. The first three years will be the hardest. But just because you're in there, you don't have to be there. You can go somewhere else. They want me to tell you, jack. You can go back a long way. But not for nothing, it was six. There is five. There could just as easily be four. You can go back a long way. "Go back a long way." They want me to tell you, jack. "Go back a long way." They go back a long way. There are five officers in this photo, ted. "It is five." At the funeral of a slain officer. "It was six." "But it could just as easily be four." That's a threat, charlie, against jack reese. That's a threat, ted. Who are these guys? Slain Police Office Laid To Rest -=http://sfile.ydy.com=-
