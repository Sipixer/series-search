Come on, i'm real good at 'em. You want me to give you one? Crews... that's my name. It'd be confusing if your name was my name. Okay, reese. Dani reese. Dani reese. Your initials are d.r. That's good. D.r. Is good. D.r. Stands for doctor. And there you have it. Couldn't be better. D.r. Is doctor. Doctor is "doc." Doc reese. Instant classic. Doc is a great name. I wish i had that name. Doc! Might be confusing if we both had the same nicknames. No gunshot. No signs of trauma. Can you help me roll him over? Stab wounds. No blood. Gone about 12 hours on the outside. You think he od'd? He sure dressed for it. He was in that band that played here last night. Rock and roll, huh? No track marks. He looks healthy. Healthy except for being dead. Well, i guess not that healthy. You think maybe he just died? People do do that, don't they? People do just die. We should run a tox screen. Yeah, we should run one. But... but? His makeup's smeared. Well, he probably had a long night. No, look closer. Well, it's smeared in one direction like... like he pressed against something. Or something pressed against him. Plastic wrap. Well, what's that it's got on it? I don't know. It looks like... makeup? Here, take the corners. Carefully. Wow, it's like a death mask. Someone held this over his face and suffocated him. Well, maybe he didn't just die. Crews. Hot lead? They're a cover band. Remember a group called heavy caliber? No. From the '80s? No. Looked a lot like this? I really wasn't into guys with wigs. Well, hot lead was a heavy caliber cover band. Lead singer, mitch wagner. I talked to the guy at the door. They sold this place out. Last four nights too. Singing someone else's music. All those people came to watch him pretending to be someone else. Killer comes up behind him, pulls this over his face. You think this is the last thing he saw? No. His breath would have fogged up the plastic. He wouldn't have seen anything at the end. The show ended, the band left, the place was locked up. Cleaning crew comes in this morning and finds the lead singer up on the stage. The victim's wife was in san diego. She's on her way back now. The piece of plastic he was suffocated with? No fingerprints on it. Waiting for dna. The band left together. We're on our way now to go talk to the other three. Heavy caliber cover band. I saw heavy caliber play the garden once. The lead singer was a "jude" something. Jude hays? Yeah, jude hays. Died in london. Drank himself to death, right? I really don't remember. Doc wasn't into guys with wigs. Doc? Dani reese. D.r. D.r. Is... doctor. Doc. Doc reese. What's the matter with her? I don't know. Doc's a great name. I wish i had that name. It would be confusing. You're probably right. You all left together last night? After the show. And then? Hal and i went to a party. And after the party? Eric and i went to an after party. And after the after party? Was there an after after party after the after party? No, after the after party, we went home...t ogether. Good show last night. Standing room only. You have a lot of fans. Mitch had a lot of fans. When he was dressed like jude hays. It wasn't just the costume. I mean, when mitch picked up that mike and stepped up in front of the crowd... he was jude hays? Sometimes it felt that way. It feel that way last night? When you left last night, had mitch taken off his costume? We don't go around dressed like heavy caliber. We'd all changed. Why? How was he dressed when you found him? He shouldn't be much longer. Dr. Stanton. There's a detective here to see you. Oh, why don't you come on back. Go ahead and open wide for me. Open wide? Your mouth. Let me have a quick look, then i'll take your history, then i'll get you into the chair. Dr. Stanton, i'm a detective. Yes. And there will be the standard police discount. I'm a homicide detective. Homicide? So this is not about your dental needs. Anyone you can think of that would have wanted to harm mitch? Tyler sims. Our first singer. Your first... so tyler sims was jude hays before mitch was jude hays? What happened to tyler? Had to ask him to leave. Because of what happened in fresno. What happened in fresno? It was terrible. The fans went psycho. They threw things. They came onstage. They went after tyler. Well, they went after all of us. What made them so angry? Tyler. He sang his own song. He sang his own song? He sang his own song. Not a heavy caliber cover song? No, one he wrote himself. And so the fans felt betrayed. Because he wasn't jude hays anymore. And so you asked him to leave. We're hot lead! We're the heavy caliber cover band. That's who we are. That's what they want. How did tyler take it when you asked him to leave the band? Mm, not good. And when you hired the new singer? It just got worse. Tyler showed up at a gig dressed as jude. Came at mitch, broke two of his ribs. When did you last see tyler? Night he attacked mitch. He did time for it. Four months. Have you seen tyler since he got out of jail? Doc, can i ask you about these marks on your wall? The original bassist for heavy caliber, before the band broke up he bedded 4,378. Bedded? So you are... just being true to the music. Where were you after the show? With a new friend. We'll be needing her name. Of course. Detective, i have some time before my next patient. Shall i uncap the sharpie? No. Do not uncap the sharpie. Okay, i'll wait for it. "Uncap the sharpie?" By that he meant... his sharpie, crews. He was planning on uncapping it. Right there in the office? Okay, got it. Thanks. Okay. Hot lead's first singer, tyler sims, did four months out in county for that assault on mitch wagner. Got out six months ago. And since then? There's no record on him. No dmv, no dwp, no land lines, no cell phones. So tyler sims gets thrown out of the band for not being jude hays enough. Then ne goes missing. Maybe if he couldn't be jude hays he didn't want to be at all. Grown men in wigs and make-up... pretending to be other grown men in wigs and make-up. The buddha said we live our lives pretending to be someone else. Oh, he said that, did he? Who did the buddha pretend to be. He was the buddha. Okay, i know you're pretty sure you're not pretending to be someone else. But maybe, reese, maybe you're pretending to be yourself. How could i pretend to be myself? Maybe the buddha was pretending to be the buddha. That makes sense. And maybe tyler sims was pretending to be a killer and pulled that plastic wrap around mitch wagner's face. But we can't find tyler sims, so let's look for jude hays. Celebrity impersonators. Birthday parties, singing telegrams. If you can't be in the cover band but you need to be jude hays, you do this. These ads list jude hays as one of the impersonations they do. And they come right to your door. Do we know that one? Yeah, i think we do. Hey, we know you. Don't we? No, you don't know me. Is that tyler sims? No, it's not. It's someone else. I'm gonna go. I don't know what you're into here, but, uh, i don't do it. Hey. That's who you are. Yeah, you're that girl. What girl? Tell 'em what girl. Last year when we were auditioning for a new lead singer, she showed up. Well we know she didn't get the job. Did she get to audition? She's a girl. And we're hot lead. So what? I can't be jude hays? No. You know what happened at the mayan last night? Someone killed mitch wagner. You know anything about it? I know you called my service asking for a singing telegram. I know that was a lie. And i know i'm out of here. It's always a pleasure every time i see you two. What happened last time you saw her? At the audition we laughed at her... when we saw who she was. How come you didn't mention her when we asked if there was anyone who would want to harm mitch? I guess we forgot all about her. Well we know how to find her. Ma'am, can we help you? Are you detectives crews and reese? Yes, we are. You're emma wagner. We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am. You didn't have to come to us. We'd have come to you. I was too afraid to stay home. Why were you afraid? Do you know who tyler sims is? Mitch replaced him in hot lead and then tyler assaulted mitch. Has tyler done something else? He called me. When? About an hour ago. What did he say? He said he understood. He said mitch was jude hays and he was jude hays too. So if i wanted, he'd come over and sing. Emma, what phone did he call on? My home phone. Do you mind if we run a trace on that number, emma? No. No one named tyler sims works here. We traced a call from here this morning. You want to double check? I know all my employees, ma'am. He works here. But his name isn't tyler sims. It's... jude hays? Yeah. I thought he was goofing on me when we hired him. Shows me his driver's license. Jude hays. Like the singer, died in the auto wreck in mexico. Six billion people on the planet. There's got to be more than one jude hays. Is your jude hays here today? Jude hays, we're looking for tyler sims. You seen him around? you called mitch wagner's house, talk to his wife? There a law against that? Not against that there isn't. I just wanted her to know. Know what? Her husband had jude's voice. I got it too. If she was missing it, i might sing to her. Where were you last night, tyler? Where were you last night, jude? Home asleep. I work real hard and when i get home, i just conk out. You didn't happen to kill mitch wagner before you conked out? Yes, i did. God, you're good. He did take your dream job away. If you were jude and mitch was jude, well you couldn't both be jude. So maybe one of you had to go. We could both be jude. Plenty of jude to go around. Yeah, but you changed your name. So you were a little more jude than mitch was. Did it legal. Went to the courthouse. It was kind of like getting married. You want to tell us what happened in fresno? Not particularly. Crowd got ugly. They were small-minded. They came to hear jude hays. You gave 'em one of your songs. No, i gave them a jude hays song. But you wrote that song, not hays. That was the song jude hays would've written if he had lived. I gave that crowd a new jude hays song. But they were small-minded. I get paid by the hour. So if you're done, i gotta get back to work. Okay, thanks. The telegram girl's name is patty york. And that's not her only job. She works at the box office at the mayan theater. She has a master key that opens all the doors. Asian pear. Looks like an apple, but it's not. Also known as a sand pear, apple pear, papple. "Papple?" Or bapple. Patty york? You remember us? Sure. You're those cops that called me to that house to sing. You always wanted to be jude hays? Yes. My mom was sort of a groupie. Do you want some, uh, soda or a cigarette? I think i have some cigarettes here. No, thank you. We're okay. You didn't tell us you worked here at the mayan, patty. I'm sorry. Was i supposed to? That was stupid. I should've told you that. Of course you'd want to know that. You mind if we ask you about when you auditioned for hot lead last year? Those two tell you what happened? They did. What did they say? They said they laughed at you. I guess they did. You worked her at the mayan, yet they never saw you here? Bands go in and out the back. You don't want a soda or some cheese? I think i brought some cheese. You have a key to the back door, right? You're here because you think i killed that guy because they wouldn't let me in their band? That and because you work right where the murder happened. I work here because it's where heavy caliber played whenever they were in la. I got a bootleg, live at the mayan. You can hear my mom in the background hollering, "turn it up!" Patty, you use a lot of plastic. Germs. You gotta be careful. Well, there's nothing in that plastic there. What's that for? There's plastic in that plastic. For leftovers? Gotta be careful. We're gonna take some of this plastic with us, okay? Where were you last night, patty? Home with winston, my rabbit. The cheese is his. What does it mean to take a life? It means that life is now yours. All that it was, all that it could've been. If you do not want it, then you should not take it. Charles. Dad. How's your bullet wound? Oh, you know, healing up. How's yours? Healing up. Charlie. Ted, this is my, uh, father. Ted? Ted. What are you doing here, dad? I'm looking for olivia. Why are you looking here? I thought she might come to see you. To see me? Why would she come to see you? She left me. Olivia called off the wedding and walked out. Oh, that's... that's terrible. Yeah. Why'd she walk out on you, dad? Because of you. Because of me? What the hell are you talking about? She left me because of you. Because of me? Because of you? Does he really have to be here? Ted, could you... would you mind? Oh. You know. You two live together? Why'd she walk out on you, dad? Because of whatever it is that you and i are doing, she says she can't take it anymore. And until we resolve things, the wedding is off. Your last name. Earley? Earley. Yeah. I know that name. Ted earley. You a friend of olivia's? So many different kinds of friend. Which kind are you? This is not the way to resolve things. Okay, you want to resolve things? You never said sorry for shooting me. No. Never did. You're a real tough guy, aren't you? Apple in the tree. You know? What does he mean by he's a friend of olivia's? I mean... ted. I love her. Oh, here we go. You what? What kind of a house is this? You gonna shoot me too? Hello. Oh! What? Your credit card got billed for last time i was here so it turns out i do owe you a song. Probably not the best time. Maybe one of you can give me a ride back to the bus stop. It's a hike. That guy was your dad? Yes. And who shot him? I shot him. Why is your car full of bullet holes? I shot it. You sure shoot a lot of things. Maybe you should be in hot lead. You really come tonight to sing? Look, i know i'm a suspect. That a rabbit isn't an alibi. But i want to help find mitch's killer. Because he was jude hays and you're jude hays too? No. Because he was a human being. The plastic we took from you doesn't match the plastic that killed mitch. So does that mean i'm not a suspect? No. It means the plastics don't match. You wanna find out what goes on around the theater at night, you should talk to al. Hey, al. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Got me. What are you doing? I'm not stealing. Oh, yeah? It sure looked like you were. Well, it's... it's just stuff that people left out there in public. It's... it's... it's valuable stuff. But they... they left it, so it's... it's not stealin'. He's got a point. You get anything good? Sure did. Got a gold lighter. $23. And banana bread. With chocolate chips? Hadn't tasted it yet. Patty told us if we want to know what goes on around here, we should talk to you. Well, i, you know, see a few things every now and again. You ever see this guy? No. You're asking me 'cause that hair band guy got himself killed, huh? And so you know, i didn't see patty that night either. You see somebody down here, al? You were taking food from a dead guy's shine so maybe you can help catch his killer. I saw him go in the back door. The victim. Was he alone? No. I saw him go in too. You sure you saw him? He had real white teeth. So i remembered. And he came out by himself. Can i go get my banana bread now? The dentist didn't mention that he came back with mitch wagner the night he was killed. You must be dr. Sharpie. Auditions for a new cover band? Your buddy isn't even in the ground and you're moving on. Where's your candle in the wind, pal? Auditioning new singers isn't really breaking the law. We got a witness that puts him in the theater at the time of the killing. Whoever said that's a liar. I mean, we're all liars. To be honest, that was a lie. Found these in his bass case. "For relief of pain," "for relief of pain," "for relief of pain." Wow. You're in a lot of pain. They're for my patients. Yeah, they all have different names on them. Different girls' names. We're gonna hold onto them. And you, while we run this down, let's go. Auditions. Why would you wanna be a guy who was shot to death? Drank his way out. In london. Shot to death in rome. By that fashion model? Yeah, that's right. No no no no no. That was the other guy. No, it was jude hays. Went through his grave when i was in italy. When were you in italy? When, uh, you were in prison. His wife's idea. How was it? Hot. Prison too. Drank himself to death. Okay. I'm sure he drank himself to death. And you talking about people drinking themselves to death really isn't helping me study. Oh, because of you and, um... yeah, because of me and... i'm just gonna go to bed. I do love you. Of course i love you. How could you ask me that? I will always love you. But you have to know it's not you, it's me. Okay. I'm gonna say good-bye now. You don't have to do this. If you're not coming with me, i don't think i wanna go there. Come to bed. I'm not done with this. Come to bed. I'm not done with you either. You ruined it for me. I had a perfectly good nickname for partner, and now i wanna call you doc, and, you know... that just ruins it. Found these in your car. We got a warrant, a witness id'ing you at the murder scene. It's the kind of thing the d.a. Likes to hear. I left with the band. I didn't come back that night. There's a different name on each of those bottles. I told you, they're for... your patients. But we checked. These women don't exist. You're writing prescriptions for pain killers, good pain killers too. For women that don't exist. Now, what kind of pain could a woman that doesn't exist be in? You know, i've been thinking about all those marks on your wall, doc, about all those women and you, and... you say it? About uncapping your sharpie. You use these to sweeten the deal, and then mitch wagner finds out about that you've been trading pills for sex and... i may have been a tad liberal with my prescription pad. But i didn't kill mitch. I have an alibi. Yeah, she said she was with you. But, you know, now we're thinking her memory might be in question, doc. Even if your alibi holds, you're still gonna get five years for the pills. Longer if one of the women brings charges. Something you two should see. The dna came back on this. The victim's saliva and skin are all over it, which makes sense. There was, however, also unknown saliva, so... it was used to kill someone else. Or the killer tried it on first. Just to see how it felt. Get dna from all the suspects. Tyler sims? Your name may be jude hays, but we need a sample from tyler sims. So put the torch down, and lift up your mask. jude said he needed some time off. He say where he was spending it? He did not. You got his cell phone on file? Let me go grab it for you. You think he'll pick up when we call? No. Not when we call. Here you go, mrs. Wagner. I thought about what you said. Hands in the air. We're gonna need a little sample from you, tyler. Why do you need a sample from me? What the hell is that? That's what got wrapped around mitch wagner's head. What's this on it? It's got a few things on it. It's got mitch on it. It's got someone else on it too. That's why we need a sample from you. This is what killed him? It's okay, you can touch it. Looks like a mask. I need to get something from my house. What's that, tyler? Fan mail. Fan mail? Fan mail. Girls send their panties to the lead singer of a cover band? When are you gonna just put those back on the table? They're probably used. Just put them down. I should have been a rock star. And the band would be? The tidwells. The tidwells. Lots of love letters. Everyone loved tyler... i mean, jude. 'cause that's who they're addressed to. Not everyone. Got one here addressed to tyler. "Your face is not his face. Your face is a lie. Take it off." Any return address? Postmarked to central post office. Got something else in here. No makeup on that. This must have been the warning. But somebody has been stalking hot lead for a while. Maybe they love to trail. Okay. So we have all the ticket lists coming in from all the theaters where hot lead played. But if the stalker were going to the shows, he probably didn't use his real name. Or even the same name twice. 'cause if there was a stalker in the crowd, i need to ask the crowd. It's you. You take a good picture, you know that? Very photogenic. I can send this to you right off of here. And you could print it. Or i can just erase it. I'll just erase it. I, uh, did what you asked. I got in touch with other hot lead fans. What you want is in there. Concert photos close to the stage. Well, they would have wanted to be close. Someone who looks like a fan, but is really obsessed. Bapple. Bapple? Or papple. Don't ask. D-do you know who you're looking for? Well, it could be anyone, really. It could be you, patty. But it's not. It's...al. Here too, in this one. Yeah, he's here too. Al... but that's not possible. He... he's just al. Where were these pictures taken, patty? Uh, this is seattle, this is san diego, this one is new york. Reese? Where would a homeless guy get the money to follow a cover band all over the country? Why'd you take the cards? From the shrine. I get the banana bread, the cash. I get the lighters, the bracelets. But why take the cards? They're not worth anything. But they were written to jude hays. That's right. They are. Oh, so they belong to you? You know, we got something else that belongs to you... a piece of plastic with a dead man's face on it. We're gonna need a d.n.a. Sample from you. His face was a lie so he had to take it off? What about your face? No. My face is not a lie. My face is rock and roll. All right. Let's take it easy, okay? Okay. Okay. They sing like him. They look like him. But they are not him. They... they... they... they... they are a lie. Al, i need you to help me out with something for a moment. There's some confusion at the station. Yeah? About what? About how jude hays died. Everyone seems to have a different version. Hmm. So maybe you can help me out. How exactly did jude hays go? Was it in a plane crash? Did he o.d.? was he stabbed by that model? He didn't die. Did he? No, he didn't. He's been here the whole time. How did you get mitch back here that night? With all his makeup on? You told him who you were. Rock and roll, baby. Rock and roll. Good night, l.a.! do you really think that's jude hays? How are you gonna prove it? There's a jude hays shirt in the rock and roll hall of fame. From a concert he did in tokyo that took six hours. Six hours? That's a lot of sweat. That's a lot of d.n.a. That's a lot of hate. What? Charlie, about me and your father and your father's fiancee, olivia... if you love her, ted, you should tell her. Just stop telling me about her. So the real jude hays, living in that alley. Eh, just spending time there. He kept a bunch of hotel rooms in different names all over the city. And those other two, tyler and patty, formed their own band? Yeah. The two judes. I'm proud of you. Proud of you, charlie. You don't need to be driving a car with bullet holes in it. You sure she's gonna show? Well, she said she'd be here. But you know women. No, not really. Neither do i. Is that... my car? Looks like... my car. What did she do to it? She painted it, ted. Why would she do that? This is your car. The one you gave me. I just painted some flowers on it. It's the same underneath.
