I was jack reese's confidential informant. Worked for him too. I killed that family,but I didn't set you up. Does everyone have a secret? You want to know mine? The one about my father having something to do with you going to prison for 12 years? - Reese-- - did I say I wanted to know? I know crews has my file. I need you to tell me what else he has. Why would I do that? You don't,I violate your parole. don't talk to ted anymore. You make him nervous for some reason. the business of miracles thank you - He's-- - frozen solid. He's frozen solid. What's with the mask? Dr. Auerbach worked long hours. He was known to use oxygen to stay mentally alert. You are? James brenford. Brenford. Like the name on the lab. Like the name on the company. And a small town in oregon,but that was gramps. He used oxygen to stay alert? It's not uncommon. Oxygen known to do this to a man? No,someone switched the tanks. When auerbach put on that mask,he was inhaling pure liquid nitrogen. Maybe it preserved him. Maybe they can bring him back. Maybe he can tell us what he saw. Lno2 comes out of that tank at 77.2 degrees kelvin. That 320 degrees below zero fahrenheit. Wherever he's gone,sadly,he's not coming back from. You seem to know a lot about this. I do own a pharmaceutical research company. Any idea who'd want to switch out Dr. Auerbach's tank? I imagine the same people that vandalized my lab,detective. Ban animal torture. The animal rights group. We had trouble with them before,but never anything like this. What was Dr. Auerbach working on? Cancer drugs. That's what we do here at brenford labs. We're in the business of miracles. I saw that commercial. The moth on the cotton ball. It's a butterfly on a cloud. Oh,okay. Now I get it. Frozen solid. Do you have to touch everything? -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> sync: Ö¥Ê¿µ°¸â&ßÇÈâÈâ -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font> Life Season 02 Episode 03</font> You found the body? Yes. I saw him,and I screamed. He was,uh,so very frozen. Like a popsicle. Yes,he was so very frozen. Is it true you,uh,broke the doctor? I hardly touched him. I just,you know... what did you do after you screamed? I called for the security people. Okay. You have keys to the lab. To all the labs. I have to wait until the scientists are done working before I can clean. Hard work. Yeah. A lot of times they eat and sleep in their labs like animals. And where were you last night? Uh,all those pieces of the doctor,do I have to clean that up? No,we'll do that. How about the rats? I'm afraid the rats are all yours. Did auerbach usually work late? Dr. Auerbach was a machine. He was finishing a clinical research study on a new cancer drug. Finish with the study,we get fda approval. We go to market. People get better. We make money. You look very healthy. Do you mind if I ask what you're taking? Medications,either over the counter or prescription. I'm not taking anything. Really? Nothing? For diet,sleep,mood? Attention span,restless leg? No. Come on,some doxepin? No trazodone? No alprazolam? No venlafaxine hydrochloride? I don't really like drugs. What's this notation here in Dr. Auerbach's file from 2002? A sexual harassment beef against him filed by a debra lee. She was? Debra lee was his first assistant. None of us knew until it ended,and it ended badly. She sabotaged his work. She destroyed records. Screaming in the hallways,crying. It was an unpleasant time. And what happened to debra lee? I had planned to pay her to stop crying and go away, but she went away before I could do that. So it all worked out then. And where were you last night? At a card game until dawn. With the deputy mayor,if you need an alibi. No pharmaceuticals at all? And you with such a high stress job. I wouldn't mind getting a sample of your blood. If you don't like needles,I'd be happy to get a hold of your urine. Mr. Brenford,can you just tell me who auerbach's current assistant is? He was a genius,a hero. He spent his life trying to cure cancer. Apparently,the animal rights people didn't like him much. Those people care more about animals than humans. They sent Dr. Auerbach hate mail,death threats. Can you imagine threatening someone like him? You have copies of those threats? They're here somewhere. Well,whoever killed him switched those tanks. That something you know how to do? Of course. Anyone with any lab experience and a label machine could do it. Where were you last night? I was home. We'd been working nonstop for days. I had to change clothes. Nonstop for days? You sleep here? Not every night. Auerbach sleep here too? Did we sleep here together? Look,I know about his last research assistant. Dr. Auerbach and I had a professional relationship. He worked hard. He expected me to as well. Well,now that Dr. Auerbach is dead,I guess this study's all yours. I don't know that I want it. Let me have it. Let me have it right now. You will give me that remote. Fine,keep it. I should send you back where we found you. You remember where that electrode was? Front door was open. It doesn't have a lock. Noticed that. Betsy doesn't believe in locks. Who's betsy? Who are you? We're the police. Who's betsy? Are you just allowed to walk in? Door was open. Didn't have a lock. Who's betsy? This time answer the question. Whoa,she's an aggressive female. We need to talk to you about your monkey. Do you have a permit for it? Bamba is a rescue monkey. Her soul is her permit,just as your souls are your permits. Well,we have these badges too. You're betsy. Betsy bournes. I run this chapter of ban animal torture. They want to take bamba away. They're police detectives,billy. They're not here about bamba. Are you? No,we're not here about bamba. Where here investigating a murder. A researcher at brenford labs. Good. That place is a death camp. Billy,be quiet. Dr. Auerbach was killed in his lab. The evil one is dead? Take that back. He was a living soul. You take that back right now. Okay,I-- I take it back. You're here because of our communications with brenford labs? You mean the death threats? We never sent any death threats. Uh,"Dr. Auerbach,"for what you did to god's creatures "we find you guilty. " You will be punished. Animals are people too. " By "punished" you mean? Nothing by our hand. He punished himself by his own actions. He diminished himself by what he did to those poor animals. If you love animals so much,why are you wearing leather shoes? They're jim shoes. They're made of jim,our founder. When he died,he willed his body for industrial use as a way to raise people's consciousness about what it means to butcher animals for food and clothing. We educate people. We don't kill them. The lab had your slogan on the wall. That'd be pretty stupid of us. Why wouldn't we just sign our names? I don't know,why didn't you? Billy,stop talking. Free speech isn't a crime. Yeah,but it turns out murder is. Where were the both of you last night? Jim also made sure we knew when to stop talking without a lawyer present. And that's where we are now. You're welcome to stay,but billy and i have to go clean the cages. They're wearing people. Just dead people. It's the texas chainsaw massacre. It's enough for a warrant. Well,for a search maybe,not for an arrest. Does it seem weird to you that they'd leave their slogans on the wall? They put dead people on their feet. Putting slogans on the wall seems pretty normal compared to that. You broke the murder victim. I hardly touched him. Forensics had to bag each piece separately. You may want to send them a bottle of something. It would be a nice gesture. They did,however,find this. What's that? It's a piece of paper taken from auerbach's pocket,fragmented after crews broke him. You like puzzles? What are you doing? You have to feel your way through this. Let the pieces speak to you. You don't feel your way through it. - You start with the corners. - Start with the corners. Who do you like? For the killing. Oh,uh,well,the research assistant. She had the means. And the animal rights group had the motivation. Married? The dead guy,was he married? No. Then the assistant is your killer. Human nature. Men and women working together always end up banging. And most people are killed by the person they're banging. Well,that's just not true. Yeah,it is. It's a fact. Come on,crews,back me up on this. Well,you two work together. When you have sex,who's gonna kill who? If I have sex with him,you're gonna kill me immediately. She's an aggressive female. So that one goes there. This one here. And we're done. "I hate you." We have to stop. "But I can't stop. I never want to stop." Is that a love letter or hate mail? Love and hate,both four-letter words. It's dated last week and initialed. By the assistant jill abraham,am I right? Nope,it's initialed "D." Auerbach's first assistant. The one he had the affair with. Her name was debra lee. "D." So what's "d" up to these days? We can't find her. Went off the map when she left brenford labs. no phone bills. No driver's license. No bank accounts. No traffic tickets. No nothing. So why does a woman who dropped off the planet seven years ago write auerbach love/hate mail last week? Is he doing her? What? What? I went to see kyle hollis. You should stop doing that,charlie. You should let the D.A.'S office take care of it,okay? You caught the killer. Yeah,I caught the killer,but not the guys who set me up. Let it be over,charlie. It's not over. Those same people are still out there. So you're gonna make them pay? Hollis said he never even heard of jack reese. Hollis said he killed those people,my friends,on his own. He gave a statement to that,charlie. I'm not sure I understand why he would even say anything about jack reese. Connie,you heard hollis confess that he was working for jack reese. Connie,you and me are the only two people who heard hollis confess that he was working for jack reese. I heard hollis confess,charlie. And he signed a statement to that. But I never heard him say he was working for reese. I never heard him mention jack reese at all. Thanks for coming,jack. Always a pleasure to see you. You feeling okay? You seem a little under the weather. What do you want? They,jack. They want to see the girl. that's not the arrangement. You don't have her anymore,jack. The arrangement is it's better for everybody if only I know where she is. Well,everybody wants to change the arrangement. Everybody wants to take a look at the seybolt girl. That's not gonna happen. You think if we have the girl,then we don't need you,jack? I have the girl. As long as I do,we have crews. That's what counts. Why are you lying,jack? they want to see the girl. Oh,they want me to tell you,jack. You go back a long way,but not for nothing,there was six. There is five. There could just as easily be four. No,no. No! No! No! No! No! Fear. Who are you afraid of,jack? That one of your zen tapes? Yeah,something like that. We still on for tomorrow? Tomorrow? Yeah,I have the-- the interview with the dean from the business school. You forgot,didn't you? No. It's for a teaching position. And I need to be there because... because you are my reference,charlie. You are my reference. My partner thinks you're good for the auerbach thing. Thing? Is that cop talk for "killing"? Yeah,that's cop talk. Because you'd rather not say the word? I can say the word if you want me to. My partner thinks you killed him. And what do you think? I think it made you sad to hear that auerbach had been killed. People do what you do because of what they've seen or what they've done. Which one are you? What did you do,betsy? Debra lee. The hate mail to the lab,the love note to auerbach. Both written by the same person. Both written by you. you married charlie crews' ex-wife. That's right. And now that detective crews is out of jail,has your life changed at all? Well,I certainly get pulled over a lot more than I used to. What do you want,crews? Hmm,you wanna arrest me,then do it. You wanna shoot me,then get it over with. Okay. Here it goes. I'd like your permission to sleep with jennifer. You want to sleep with my wife? No,I want to sleep with my wife. Ex-wife. It's complicated,mark. Can I call you mark,mark? Mark? It's okay,you don't have to give me an answer now. Think about it. Get back to me. Is that from where the monkey hit you? Someone hit you after the monkey? Do I want to know? Glad we could have this talk. Why'd you change your name? Because I didn't like who I was. are you someone else now? I'm a better person now. Just for the record,did auerbach get it on with betsy bournes or debra lee? I'm not sure that we have to sit here for this. I'm not sure we care,counselor. Your client withheld information pertinent to an ongoing murder investigation. So just sit down. You loved him and you hated him? I'd like that note back,please. That note is evidence. I left that lab because of what he did in his work. But I couldn't leave him because of what he did to me,what we did to each other. And for the record,I let him call me anything he wanted to. You like being betsy bournes? Yes,very much. It's who I'm supposed to be. Do you understand? I do. If the people of ban animal torture found out about you and auerbach¡ª they would have asked me to leave. Is that why you killed him? My client admits to the sex. But that,as far as I know,is not a crime. So now I'm getting up. And so is my client. If betsy/debra were still having sex with auerbach, I know two people that might not be so happy about it. Well,let's go talk to 'em. But I get the assistant,and you get monkey boy. Betsy,debra. If you have sex with a woman with two names does that¡ª no,it doesn't count as a threesie. well,I see you got your remote back. But I have to watch her shows. You going somewhere? I don't believe that. but it's true. They never stopped. All those years,all those protests,they kept at it. just like a couple of rabbits. It doesn't bother you that she was doing that with the man you hated? She lied. People lie. Anyway,I'm outta here as soon as she gets back to take care of the animals. Do you mind? They're bamba'S. Ask her. I don't do this for the money. We don't get any of it. My little brother died of cancer. After watching that,really,what else could I do? Why work with auerbach? For auerbach. Because he was the best. No one else came close. I joined a club to impress a girl once. Man,was I ever young. I joined ban animal torture because I believe in the cause,not to impress betsy. Debra. I can't even remember the cause. I remember the girl. I ended up marrying her. Aren't you supposed to be looking for a killer? That's what I'm doing. Excuse me for saying this,jill,but the way you talk about auerbach, it kinda sounds like you loved him. Me in love with auerbach is impossible. Because you are? A woman who values her own worth. He may have been a genius,but he was also an egotistical,selfish jerk. Some women go for that. Devoted assistant types,especially. Yeah,I've heard that,detective. But I don'T. He was cruel to me. He was cruel to almost everyone he came into contact with. Was he cruel to anyone in particular? Are you married? Her mate died in auerbach's lab. And still betsy bournes was having sex with auerbach,with that killer. Animals are people,but I guess some people are animals too,right? Yeah. Bustamante,the janitor,auerbach just loved to pick on him. Auerbach was having a bad day,work wasn't going well,bustamante caught the heat. You didn't mention this before because? I didn't think of it. Bustamante's around all the time,but you never see him,you know? You said anyone who works in the lab could have switched those tanks? Crews. Ladies. I didn't let it bother me. I needed the work. Besides,a guy like you,if you wanted to, you could take care of him anytime you want,right? And if I did,I woulda used my hands. Not those hoses. The way he used his hands on you? We heard you broke a beaker,and he threw his lab book at you. Slapped you if the lab wasn't clean enough. Look,he got what he deserved. I don't feel bad about it. But? But I saw something. What kind of something? Someone,that night,comi o outf his lab. I didn't want to say nothing before because I didn't want to get involved. I saw a woman. Do you know this woman? Maybe. I try not to pay too close attention. Let's see if we can figure out a way for you to see her again. We tape people going into the building,not out. Standard flow control theory. You think about my offer? What offer? You're just being selfish. I mean,what am i asking for really? Ushing it down the toilet anyway. There,there,that's her. *** Can you zoom in there? Anything for you,detective. holy hannah. That's debra lee. well,according to the time stamp,she entered well before the murder. Come in with a crowd,less chance of being noticed. When did you see her leave? A little after midnight. Just after the killing. billy,you have to understand. This has nothing to do with you. So what,I'm just like a monkey to you? Just like bamba? Maybe I should live in a cage. Is that what you'd like,for me to live in a cage? Door. Unlocked. Debra lee,you are under arrest for the murder of dan auerbach. Billy,tell them I was with you. We have video of you entering the lab on the day of the murder. I was there earlier that day. To do what? You know what. Billy,don't be a child. Tell them I was with you. Who have a witness who puts you in the lab when auerbach was killed. Well,whoever is saying that is a liar. you're the liar. Whore! Whore? So I guess it did bother you that she and auerbach were-- whore? You tried to be a man about it when I was last here. You did a good job. But you're hurt,kiddo. So go ahead and call her all the names you want. But then you tell us what you know. billy.Tell them. The same hands that tortured animals touched your body. Like you wanted to touch her? Okay,yes! Like I wanted to,but never... billy. I'm so sorry. No,you're not! Don't say that! All right,enough. We're taking her away now. They're gonna put her in a cage. She'll get a number,and they'll treat her like an animal like she deserves. You will never have to see her again. Stop. We were at a prayer vigil. I shot video of her. I always shot video of her. Any reason why you didn't just tell us all this before? Jim told us to d obeythe police. Jim. The guy in your shoes? I'm leaving. Bamba's coming with me. Maybe in a while you can see her,but not now. I guess I was too nice to the animals. That's why you couldn't love me. does your daughter ever talk about detective crews? No. Why would she? Because they're partners. We don't talk about the job in the house. Not now,not ever. Still,you must be very proud of her following in your footsteps. Hey,fellas. Any of you see who killed auerbach? I know nobody likes a rat,but seeing as you guys are already rats... you look like a rat I knew inside. Have you got family up in pelican bay? Detective crews. Your alibi checked out. We've moved off you as a suspect. "Moved off." Is that cop talk? Detective crews,why are you here? Dad. Did you really send an innocent man to prison? Get outta my house. You'd need a pretty big dose of this to do any real damage. - You just inhaled it? - Yeah. You may experience psychic disturbances,hallucinations. Anything like that yet? Nope,nothing. Maybe you should drive me home. No! No! No! No! No! No! This is a really nice car. It's italian. From italy. I've never been to italy. You been to italy? Would you like to go? They have souls there. Italian souls. Extremely tasty souls. Let's talk about it tomorrow. I'm sorry your lover's dead. Me too. I wish she'd stop doing that. Detective reese? Is that you? Hey,ted. This is betsy bournes. She lives with a monkey. Charlie,this is hal orton,dean of the business school. Get your hair caught in the car door? Yeah,that's right. I tried that already. Of course you did. Oh,I can see your keys right there on the front seat. Of course you can. Do you have a knife? - No. Why? - So I can cut my hair. One time,I got something caught in a car door,but it was not my hair. Did you cut it off? No,but I did use these. So,Mr. Crews,ted here handles your considerable settlement? Why would you want to know that? well,it's a business school,charlie. My business,since I got out,has been growing your wealth. - Ted and I were in jail. - He knows that. For a very long time. I've been thinking,we should have learned to play the harmonica,ted. - maybe I should come back. - That's what I've been thinking. Maybe you should come back. I really am sorry your lover is dead. I'm really sorry too. And I'm the sorriest of all. *** Oh,sorry. Listen,detective,when I was heading home in my car right now, I couldn't help but overhear you saying-- no,screaming¡ª "no. No. No. No." You were pounding your wheel. I'm a punch-the-roof guy myself. And I know you think I'm a bit of a clown. But if you ever really want to talk,I've been through some stuff. I got it. I got it. I got it. See? Thank you. Anybody else think this is weird? Crews. if the protest video puts betsy in oxnard at the time of the killing, then why did bustamante say he saw her in the lab that night? Yeah. You,um,you don't just see women who aren't there. He was lying,crews. Why would he lie? Let's find out. He was lying because he was stealing. A janitor. Around all the time,but you never really see him. Well,we see him now. who is this? industrial espionage. Bustamante gives her the pills. And she gives him the money. I can see him tuesday,then? you mind if i take a look in there? Cash? This is? My...our son. You're his wife? Ex. I'm his ex-wife. You'll see him tuesday? Your son? That's right. My son. Got your divorce papers here. You didn't mention you and your wife were split when she alibied you. That's right. I didn'T. hardly divorced,looks like. Got no custody. It looks like. That's right. She got everything. When did your son get sick? - Two years ago. - Rare form of cancer. You know when you,with uh... access to these pills. The pills were working. So what went wrong,abel? He caught me stealing them. He? Auerbach. Then what did you do? He wouldn't give the pills to me. To my son. I killed him. Auerbach wouldn't give me the pills,so I killed him. What is it you were flushing down the toilet,that branford wants? He wants my urine. Or my blood. He thinks I'm healthy. He wants to study it. No,that's not what he wants. No? What does he want? He wants to study you. That's what I just said. No,reese. He wants you. And his play is asking me for fluid samples? Well,he's a scientist. They're all scientists. We may have solved a murder,reese,but we have not solved the murders. Murders? Why these rats,reese? The rats with the blue and yellow tags. Are still alive. The rats with the red tags,are dead. Why these rats,reese? I'll tell you why these rats. These rats are from the control group. Which means they are not chosen at random. Why would you only kill rats in a control group? You kill these rats to cover up the fact that the drug wasn't working. Okay,but bustamante says it was working on his kid. That child has a rare form of cancer. If branford wants to cash in on the drug,it'll have to work much wider than that. Who would want to cover that up? Why these rats,abel? I already told you. They're just rats. no,they're not just rats. They were living souls,and they died for a reason. Who told you to kill these rats? No one told me anything. - Who killed auerbach? - I did. But not with your hands,like a man? You're going to jail,abel. That's okay. See,that's the part that makes me curious. Why is it okay? you covering up for someone,abel? You take the fall,while someone gives your son those pills,when your in jail? What do you want from me? You're a smart guy,abel. You know you're going away. If it were me,and I were going,I'd keep a little protection. A little something to make sure all those pills don't stop. That'd be the smart thing. so how do you make sure your son keeps getting those pills when you're in jail? we're shutting down the lab,abel. There are no pills for anyone now. You're going to jail for nothing. No more pills? You have to take me to the lab. This was going to save your son? Start with the corners. You're joking. They're all corners. thank you for coming by,ms. Abraham. What is she doing here? jill abraham,this is betsy bournes. - I know who she is. - And I know who you are. In fact,I used to be you. Yeah? Who are you now? ladies,please. We have a small science problem. Since both of you are scientists,we thought maybe you could give us some help. As you know,abel bustamante has been arrested for the murder of Dr. Auerbach. Now,we found this on him. We think it's from the lab. We know it's evidence. See those little squiggles there? That's science stuff,right? You're going to put this back together by hand? We've had some practice. The variations in the pieces are too minute to do it by hand. that's what I told them. You'll need a laser measure. I could take it back to my lab. I have the right equipment there. That's a great idea. Why don't you? It's the lunch menu. That there. It's the lunch menu. you were right. We couldn't do it by hand. It was uh,all corners. you know,ms. Abraham,you're a scientist. So maybe you can help us out here. that's science,right? Yeah. Um,but i don't recognize it. are you sure? Because betsy thinks she knows what it is. And since she used to be you,we thought you might know what it is. it's a calculation. Figuring how much liquid nitrogen it would take to kill a man who is 71 inches tall,and weighs 183 pounds. and that's about Dr. Auerbach's size. my guess? We find his medical file,that's exactly auerbach's size. My guess? That handwriting there,it's yours,jill. you kill auerbach. You set up betsy first,and when she alibis out,you had bustamante there to take the fall. A back-up plan. That's good. Dr. Auerbach was calling off the study because the drug wouldn't work wide enough. There was no money in it. that's why she killed those rats! To make it look like it was working. Kimbo gets it,now. And,F.Y.I.,I had the sexy assistant pegged from the get-go. Auerbach was a thief! He stole seven years of my life. And then,what? The study's no good? The drug is no good? And you're no good? you knew he used oxygen to stay alert. You switched those tanks. - You killed auerbach. - He was throwing me away! He was still auerbach. And all I was,was a failed study. My career was over. No one was calling off that study. No one. You used to be me? Well,you can be me again. Because I don't want to be me anymore. Auerbach's lab is evidence. All those pills are evidence. Sometimes evidence gets misplaced. Misplaced? So I just want to say,thank you so much for giving ted another chance. Well,ted explained what happened,so... yes,you know how in your line of work sometimes you'll find yourself in a lab, and you,you knock something over. And you inhale something that you shouldn't,and the next thing you know¡ª well,it's over and done with. Let's move on. Okay? Now... perhaps you can tell me,Mr. Crews, the way in which Mr. Earley has diversified your holdings,huh? Oh,excuse me for one moment. Ted,go ahead and start. Hey,jenn-- You asked my husband permission to have sex with me? It was the honest thing to do. It was the stupid thing to do. When things like that happen,you pretend it didn't,and you go on. You don't talk about it with the husband of the woman you want to have sex with in the back of a car. Do we want to pretend it never happened? That would be the civilized thing to do. Do we want to be civilized? You guys see that? She was
