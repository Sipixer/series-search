This guy's a cop,man. Something I said? -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly presents</font> -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> How come when you want to get a kid to talk,you always make fun of me? I do? Do I? - Yes. - Not always. Do I? Do you want to drive the car? Do you want me to drive the car? No,I don'T. Hey,bro! That's no fair,man. You weren't supposed to be in the cells. Not supposed to be in,yet just can't seem to stay out of 'em. I got an expectation of privacy. Hey,stop talkin',man. I got your personal effects here. I heard he chews the bottle after he shoots it? That's just exactly what I said. Hey,he knows,man. You need to stop talking. He chew this kind of bottle? Quality steroids? It's not the kind of junk we usually find on you fellas. You fellas? That's profiling right there,is what that is. Boy's a monster? Turns out,we're looking for a monster. you help us find him,we'll help you with holding this. Help us with this? You get caught with this,all you get is to testify in front of the U.S.Senate. - What he said. - Can we go? Yeah,you can go down to processing. Should take a few days. System's real slow. We'll talk again then. What she said. Narcotics tracked the steroids to a flext gym,over in beverly hills. Is there a monster in beverly hills,max? You believe in monsters? Don't you? Ah,detectives. How can I help you? - are yothe manager? - Owner. Dr. Jackson bridger. - This is ours. - Yours? Yes,this is part of our flext steroid regimen. Your regimen? You dispense steroids here? I'm a board-certified physician,so I prescribe them. Our pharmacist dispenses them. Can I ask you where you got this? Off a couple of gang-bangers. They probably don't work out here. No,they probably don'T. Any idea how they could have gotten a hold of this? What happens to them after I prescribe them,I,uh,I really can't say. My wife looks familiar to you,doesn't she? Yeah,but I can't place her. Does this help? September,1999? No,I was away. Miss september,1999. Likes hikes? Fresh-baked bread? Puppies? Since you dispense steroids to the members of the gym, it'd be a big help if we could take a look at your membership list. Sorry,no can do. You see,the--the people training here pay a lot of money. - They have a certain,uh-- - expectation of privacy. Yeah,yeah. Well,uh,we could come back with a warrant. With that,I wish you the best of luck. These folks are not members. They are my patients. Their records are covered by doctor-patient confidentiality. Carla horta goes to a bad party,someone calls her father. Father shows up,probably not very happy. Father gets extremely beaten to death. Couple of bangers talking about a guy capable of that, holding steroids traced back to here. I do it because children seem to enjoy it. When I make fun of you. Because they think you're uptight. I am-- I am-- I am no uptight. I'm not uptight. If you wanna drive the car,go ahead and drive. Take a look at that. bankley. Now there's a name we know. benny bankley. His father brendan bankley anowns bkley realty. Which owns the bankley building. Where the party took place. What's the son of the building's owner doing going into the gym where the steroids came from? Don't know. Benny does not look capable of breaking every bone in max horta's body. You know,just because I don't say everything that pops into my head does not make me uptight. I didn't say you're uptight. I said kids think you're uptight. Though kids are tough to fool about that. Kids are notoriously tough to fool. What did those bangers say again? "Boy's a monster." Marty hawkins,used to play high school ball with benny. Marty had a little more team spirit though. He took a bat to the opposing team's pitcher,broke his leg. - He do time? - No. Released on condition he had counseling. Two more assault beefs knocked down the same way. Oh,to grow up rich and connected. - You're rich,right,crews? - Not from birth. You're so rich,how come you don't have a car? I gave it away. Really? See,I heard that your "roommate" ran over it with a tractor. That was the other one. annabelle shore. What exactly do they do to the not beautiful in that part of town? Annabelle went to the same high school as our other two friends here. But unlike them,she has a job. And her parents? Mom is a pricey defense attorney. Dad died when she was a kid. Why aren't you bringing these kids in for questioning? On what charge? You guys don't plant evidence around here? Our gang of three is at a table set for four. Our gang doesn't have a leader. What's up,big guy? What's up,man? I'm guessing that's him. Patrick bridger. Same high school as the other three,but patrick is just a little bit smarter. His iq tested in the genius range. Does that really mean anything? Pretty sure it does. Child chess master,pitcher on the high school baseball team,thrown out of yale. For? Apparently,just never going to class. Not even once. And patrick's father,jackson bridger. Owner of flext. Where the steroids came from. Where the steroids came from. Anybody up there look familiar? We talk,we walk? Hulk here. - He gave us them 'roids. - What'd you give him? Phone numbers for hood girls. Just the pretty ones? A couple of hood rats point their fingers at some beverly hills kid. Who's connected enough to walk away from three assault raps. Yo,maybe y'all should plant something. - The oatmeal's $20. - I'm buying,have two. Oh yeah,you're rich. But I guess you worked for it. Did you just say something ni?To me no,I don't think so. Put that down. They're not boys. They're dogs. Patrick-- one in the middle-- alpha dog. Marty,he's second. Beta dog. Benny... omega dog. He's the fool. Hmm,that's what you see. I see a group of spoiled rich kids. And I want the big one in lock-up. If that's what you want,that is what you shall have. On what charge? Assaulting a police officer? This one's got it's name written all over you. Can we help you? See? Alpha dog. Beta dog,right? You're the one with his nose always up alpha's ass? Man,you're a big one! 'Roids,right? Is it true what they say? It makes some things big,but other things,you know,like,real small? Police! Down on the floor,now! Now! Can I help you? I know you know who I am,so let's not pretend you don'T. Okay? You're jack reese. That's right. And you're-chat ex paonrolee that lives with crews. I know crews has that girl. I need you to tell me what else he has. Why would I do that? If you don't,I violate your parole. You're not even a cop anymore. You just keep saying that when you're back in the slam serving that last four years. "Jack reese wasn't even a cop anymore." Do you like empty swimming pools,marty? Or parties with pretty hood girls? What about lethal injections? What's your take on that? Patrick puts his finger to his lips and you obey,that how it works? Woof. detective. I have young marty's attorney here,annabelle shore. Annabelle shore? We know a girl with that name,don't we,marty? I'm her mother. Do you all know each other? What I know is that marty's been released. Unshackle him,please. He assaulted a police officer. I have witnesses who will testify detective crews incited marty to those actions. Okay,before he goes,do you think marty could tell us where he was when max horta found himself dead at the bottom of this pool? Go ahead,marty. You can tell them. I was at my therapist'S. At your therapist's all night? I get bad nights. Terrors. Can't sleep. Always have,ever since I was little. When I have really bad nights,sometimes I stay at dr. James' house. That's where I was. I will tell you that marty was at my house all night that night. But,really,that's all I will tell you. Doctor-patient confidentiality. Yeah,there's a lot of that going around. Is it normal for doctors to allow patients to stay at their house? Each patient is an individual,so the word "normal" does not apply. If I were your patient,could I stay over? Sometimes I have bad nights. - Did I say that out loud? - Crews. My partner thinks I say everything that pops into my head. Is that normal? I think you should leave now. Right,because there is no such thing as normal. Which is a relief,because sometimes I don't feel normal. Is it normal not to feel normal? I'm sure some people find you charming,detective. I don'T. How much do you charge an hour,doc? My hourly rate is competitive. $450 an hour? For a 50-minute hour,yes. How can it be an hour if it's 50 minutes? That's messing with time. I do say everything that pops into my head. Maybe I should come back. If I wanted to make an appointment,who should I call? You should call another doctor. Rich parents,high-priced lawyers,shrink's at $450 an hour. Then you know what happens. It's the chief on the phone,your name in the paper,and you wishing it was a gang killing. You go after a gang and miss,maybe they shoot you,maybe you get 'em next time. You go after one of these princes and miss,you're doing traffic in time square. So what am I saying to you,detectives? You're saying don't miss. Let's go talk to the alpha dog. Un hotel. Hotel gentil. Un hotel. Hotel gentil. I'm not talking to you. You just did. Hotel gentil. Un hotel. hotel gentil. hey,benny. Remember me? Patrick tell you not to talk to us? Well,it's patrick I want to talk to. Learning french? I want to live in paris some day. With patrick? Patrick? In paris? No,never. Why not? Patrick,he's L.A. You've seen him. You understand what I mean. Do you know where he is now? - Charging. - Charging? He says he needs it. And where does he charge? Out there on his bike. Says he needs to feel the city. and you believe that? That he just drives around L.A.On his bike? Why would he lie?Besides-- you can see it when he comes back too. So alive. Lit up. It's like I said. Patrick is L.A. You know? - It's like if he weren't here then-- - L.A.Wouldn't be here either. is that why you want to go to paris? Because it's not patrick? I'd like you to look at something. That's max horta. He left behind a wife and two daughters. Max horta? He's L.A.Too,annabelle. Trace came back on that call max got that sent him to that party. It came from his daughter,carla. Carla,do you recognize any of these people? I don't remember. I don't remember them. I don't remember calling my papa. My god. Oh,my god. Did I call him? Did I call him,and then he came,and then they-- can I ask you about the girl,rachel seybolt? Both you and charlie were close friends with the murdered family? They were our dear friends,yes. And you were close with the daughter rachel? Yes. Hey,rachel. There's someone here to see you. Rachel,honey. You remember me? I remember you,rachel. You used to brush my hair. You remember that? I had those gold shoes. The party shoes,you used to call them. It's okay. We're just gonna sit with you for a while then. Open the door. Open the door. - Back door. - Got it. Right. I remember this. Oh,god. Oh,I remember that. I can'T. I can't,charlie. It's-- no,it's--it's his. It's my husband's car. I really gotta get a car. You and your partner looking for me? I've been watching you train. Pretty intense. Ex-addict work out,right? Lots of anger. Anger's good. Why don't you come down to the station? We can talk about it. Why don't you come on a ride with me on my bike? And we won't have to talk. Do you really like talk? Where would we go? Out there. What's out there,patrick? Everything. All the time. I'd really like for you to come down to the station with me. No. That's not what you'd like. he came to your gym? I called. You didn't pick up. Must have been in a canyon. "Everything,all the time." That's what he said. That's what these kids think they can have. Everything,all the time. Everyone works for them. Even us. Even the shrink. Dr. Lana james. She works for them. She's not one of them. What? Worm. Didn't I tell you organic fruit would kill you? Didn't I? Worms are just protein,right? Oh,please don't do that. Why would you do that? What's wrong with you? Dr. James? Come with me,please. One of my patients was arrested? That seems to be the case. Do you know which one? I'm sorry,ma'am,I don'T. I was told one of my patients was arrested and was asking for me. I'd like to know who it is. I'm just the new captain around here,ma'am. They don't like to tell me much. But one of the detectives will certainly know more. Please. That's a crime board. We use it to see the connections between the suspects and the victims. The victim's the dead man there. See,there's the kind of con tctionshose kids have that get you floor seats to laker games. Mm-hmm,and there's the kind of connections that we have that get you life in prison. I'm on here. Why? Why would i be on there? Oh,come on,you're smart,doc. You can see why. Marty's connected to the dead man. You're connected to marty. When marty goes down for max horta's murder,so do you. are you ready for that,doc? Life in prison? You really think when it comes down to it,they're gonna be there for you? You're the help. Just like us. I'm on here. Marty wasn't with me that night. I don't know where he was. He wasn't with me. Patrick asked me to lie. Why would you do that? You wouldn't understand. Now what happens? Now you get patrick to say it. I think we should go in. Just a-- just a quick look. To supervise. Come on. At least turn the cameras on. Get a sketch artist up here? You don't think very much of me,do you,detective? No,ma'am. I sure don'T. But,like you said,I wouldn't understand. I'm done. You can get dressed. No smile tonight,dr. James? Okay. In fact,it's better. We need to talk,patrick. "We need to talk." Is that that "professional" voice you use when you're in session with annabelle? I didn't know she saw annabelle too. - no,this is serious. - Okay. I'll make you a deal. You climb on for a little ride... and then we'll talk. - How little? - I won't even turn the key. the police came to question me. No,use the professional voice. How do you talk to annabelle? You need to listen to me,patrick. The police came to question me about marty. I don't think they believe me. I believe you. I do. I think that you are a very believable woman. Patrick,you need to take this seriously. remember the last time we were here? You liked the way I made you feel? Tell me. Tell me. I liked the way you made me feel. Oh,that's pretty good. He just discredited her as a witness. A shrink who's been having sex with her patient's boyfriend. How's that gonna play out in front of a jury? Everything,all the time. No,no,no. Not yet. Don't get off yet. Hey,crews,reese,I know you're out there. You having fun? You like to watch? Watch this. Patrick. I'd like to have heard what he just said to her. - How did she hear what he said? - How did she hear? He was practically on top of her. No,not her down there. How did max's daughter elsa hear? How did she hear what her father said? It would have been... too loud! El ? You lied to us,didn't you,elsa? You didn't hear your father on the phone that night,did you? You couldn't have. It was too loud. Did you stay here when he left you? You didn't stay,did you? did your father get mad when you disobeyed him? Yeah? My father too. He would get so mad when I wouldn't listen to him. But you wanted to make your father happy,didn't you? Me too. I wanted to make my father happy,because he loved me. Like your father loved you. Did you leave here,elsa? I followed my father. And you saw something bad? What did you see,elsa? My father,outside that building. Did you see anybody else? A very big man. what did the big man do? He hit my father over and over. My father was screaming. But he kept hitting him. Then my father stopped screaming. Elsa,the big man,did you see his face? elsa. That's him! That's the one. I didn't do what my father asked of me. Now he's dead. what kind of monster makes my daughters think they killed their own father? You tell me what kind. He's not a monster. He's a punk. Crews. Dr. James? He's in there. Something's wrong. He's--he's not marty anymore. He came here and I could see it right away. I could tell marty was gone. Don't you guys have bigger guns? Marty! Marty! - Reese,pop the clip! - I got it! You were supposed to help us. He's dead. "You were supposed to help us"? You were seeing all of them,weren't you? Even patrick. You'll never get patrick. Massive steroid overdose. Someone pumped a solution into him with 20 times the potency of an average dose. Mm,steroid hotshot. Marty was a loose end. Patrick was cleaning up the mess. should I release the body? Can you hold off on that? Your buddy patrick put marty on the slab there,benny. No,that's a lie. We're friends. We've al--always been friends. Maybe you should tell marty here that patrick's his friend. But marty can't hear you,'cause he's a little dead right now. You can look all you want to,benny. He's not gonna get any less dead. If we just do what patrick tells us to do,then it will all be okay. It's not okay. Benny,did you not do what patrick told you to do? Is that why it's not okay? What happened at that party? What did patrick tell you to do? He told me to go with that girl. Carla? He told you to go where with her? Into her room. Patrick opened the door. There she is on the floor,out of it. What did he want you to do? He told me that I could do what I want with her. Patrick had gotten me girls before,but they were pros. But that girl carla,she was real. So you called her father. After patrick closed the door,I took her cell phone, I speed-dialed the number that said "dad," and then I told the dude that answered that his daughter was in trouble. To come and get her. Then I left the room. And I got so drunk I couldn't think. And what happened to max horta? I guess marty took care of him. And patrick took care of marty. - You guess? - I'm the clown. I make patrick laugh,but he doesn't tell me anything. He knows I'm soft. He knows not to trust me. Who does he trust? Annabelle. He trust annabelle not to lie to him? She'd never lie to anybody. That's why patrick loves her. That's why we all love her. But she's gone. I can't find her anywhere. I can't find annabelle. Did patrick kill her too? Is there a problem? The best thing about paris: It's not L.A. Right,annabelle? If L.A.Is patrick,then getting away from L.A.Is getting away from him. I didn't think you'd be cruel. He is. Believe me. Patrick told me about you. He admires you. Admires how you didn't lay down. How you took it and made a new life for yourself. I'm gonna make a new life for myself. Unless I'm under arrest. We have nothing to hold you on. No,you can go. Send me a postcard. Just before you do go... I want you to meet some people. annabelle,this is carla and elsa horta. Girls,this is annabelle. patrick. Where are you,annabelle? At my house. Marty was just here. Did you hear what I just said,patrick? You said marty was just there. It was bad,patrick. He's all messed up. He said that you tried to kill him. Annabelle,what are you doing? Marty said that you tried to kill him. He said that you gave him some bad juice. He's looking for you,patrick. What's going on? Annabelle,stay right there. Hold on. Hello? Patrick,what's going on? What do you mean,benny? With marty. Haven't you heard? He was arrested. The cops have him. I'm out of here,man. I'm going south. Wet your bed until you were seven years old? Is that-- that's late,right? Where'd you get that? Also says here that you often feel like a fraud. You told your therapist you wanted to be more like benny? How'd you get that? "Because people know who benny is,but no one knows who I am." How'd you get that? Your shrink gave it to me. When she found out you tried to kill marty,she gave us this. That's a lie. You are lying to me. Marty says you killed max horta. You do that,patrick? No,he did that! And then he comes crying to me about it! "What am I going to do,patrick? Help me,patrick. I lost my temper,patrick." Crying ldae a mn baby. Marty says you tried to kill him too. A hotshot of steroids? Yeah,I jacked him up. But guess what? It didn't kill him. Yeah? But guess what? It did. They think it's their city. It's not. It's our city. This car's just an object. Objects have no meaning. They don'T. They don'T. You're a nut job. You know that,crews? - What's with that car? - It's just an object. Doesn't have any meaning. Even if it did,it'd be in italian. So I wouldn't understand it anyway. You gonna write me a ticket? Like that bond trader who's puttin' it to your ex? I know hollis worked for you,jack. Even if that were true,the proof would be in my lapd file,which I heard has gone missing. Yeah,I heard that. Okay. You drive carefully now. Oh,don't talk to ted anymore. You make him nervous for some reason. this is reese.****** -=http://sfile.ydy.com=-
