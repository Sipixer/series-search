Like what something? Why in heaven's name would you want to do this by yourself? I'm not saying you would want to do this at all, But if you were to do this, Why would you do it by yourself, am i right? He didn't think he was by himself. He thought he was with her. Well, let me tell you something, there is no her. And there is no bethany, okay? There is a 13-Year-Old member of the marching band With an online account and a social disorder. - You played the... - Trombone. And i was good. Let's look for a suspect in the real world, shall we? What about the girl? Did she know what mikey was up to? - Didn't look like it. - Engaged for about a month. She was spending the night at her sister's. "Why would you want to be with that fat cowboy?" Fat cowboy? "If that's what he told you he looks like, it's not true. "He's not slim. He's not athletic. "He doesn't have blue eyes or blond hair. He's lying to you, bethany." I think we need to go back to the wrecking yard. You wanna know what he really looks like? He must weigh 300 pounds. Mud-Brown eyes. He's balding under that hat. He's not tall, and he's ugly. Why would you want to be with that, bethany? Why would you want to be with someone like... Rob. Why don't you stand away from the desk for us? Hey, rob, If that's bethany, tell her i say hello, okay? He's on me. - Reese? - Crews, get him off. Get him off of me! He's on me! How 'bout you get off my partner? Okay, uh, first day... No problem.

"A practical introduction to effective business practices"? Yes? Great. Uh, good morning. My name is ted earley. As in the early bird, but... With an "e"... Between... The... "L" and the... The "y." Okay, we've got a long way to go, So let's start with a simple question. What is business? Uh, yes, miss. Is this class gonna be graded or pass/fail? So, what... is... What is business? The answer is everything. Everything is business. Every historical event, every war. Every decision made by every government. Any book stocked or sold. From the moment that eve first decided To accept delivery of that apple From that snake, We have been engaged in... Business. - I don't like getting sat on, rob. - She doesn't. You know, you did a good job trashing your computer. But we got guys in the basement, All they do is pull stuff off computers. Pulled some pretty good stuff off of yours. You know, you'd probably like a job like that. Down there in the dark, just you and a computer. Wanna talk about bethany? - Please don't say her name. - Why not? It's a pretty name. It's not for you to speak it. What about mike? Could he speak it? We got mike's computer. Mike and bethany were going at it pretty hard. - Stuff that made my partner blush. - Stuff i've never even heard of. You and bethany, though, from what we read, Didn't really get into that. Seems like you and bethany were just friends, though. Right, rob? I've got guys in my life like that. Just friends kinda guys. It's a little sad. She sent you stuff like, "If you saw me, would you know me? I look for you wherever i go." It's nice, i guess. Not like the stuff she sent mike. Bethany never sent you anything like this, did she? It's okay, rob. You can look. Hey, rob... I know you've got a secret. Won't you share it with me? The secret you and bethany were i.M.Ing when we walked in? I'll read your part, rob. "You don't have to worry about what happened." - What happened, rob? - "It's your secret, bethany. Now it's mine. - No one else will know." - Are you covering for bethany? Because that's what we call being an accomplice to murder. "Just tell me one thing. Tell me that you love me." My partner will read this part. - I... - You shut up. You do not say those words. That is not for you to say. Bethany was sending mike pictures like this, and not you? Never you, and still you're gonna defend her? Strangers seeking strangers. You met her there first. Then what? You brag to mike, mike goes online, then takes her away? Mike brody got up in her head. He confused her. He could do that, but she figured it out. She figured him out completely. What happened that night, rob? I can't tell you. It's a secret. You find who was on the other end of these i.M.S, You find this bethany. Then you go through the looking glass And you bring 'em back here. We already talked to the geeks in sex crimes. They said it would take a few days, low priority. Well, hold him until you get that trace. On what charge? On the charge of freakin' me the hell out. We have everything we need to find bethany right here. If we need to figure out where bethany is, We need to figure out who bethany is. And who bethany is is in here. Well, bethany is not gonna be that. No, maybe not. But bethany is in there. We just gotta find her. - What are we looking for? - Anything that seems real. Anything that's mentioned more than once. Tennis. - Got it. - Got it. Ocean breezes. Got it. Wait, wait... Uh, no, no. Ocean breezes. - Junior in college? - Yep. You got this? No, i'm pretty sure i don't. Is it funny every time? I think it might be. "Went to school in l.A." "Wanted to stay close to home." "Was on campus, but living at home now." "Played two years for my school." "Played two years until i had to stop." "Living at home now." "Played two years until i had to stop." - "Until i had to stop." - "Until i had to stop." She's from l.A. Went to schools in l.A. Check the tennis squads of all the local colleges. - Go back a few years. - Got a listing for a bethany. Got a home address. Hi. Can i help you? We're looking for bethany. You found her. Through the looking glass. Enjoying your job? I am just a humble public servant. Oh, you're the police. We need to ask you some questions. Mom, the police are here. You want some lemonade? Mom! The police are here! She'll be right down. I told 'em about all the coke and hookers in the pool house. I'm so sorry about that. Hi, i'm detective crews. This is detective reese. Are you here... Is this about my daughter? - Yes, we'd like to talk to you about... - I'm sorry. Here. My husband. He handles these things. Put the phone anywhere when you're done. What just happened? I was just about to ask you the same thing. I hear...music. It's a new cd we have coming out next week. It's nice, isn't it? So now, detective, maybe you can tell me why you were at my house. Mr. Gray, we have reason to believe Your daughter bethany might have been involved in a murder. Involved? Involved exactly how? There was an online relationship. - Two online relationships, in fact. - Online? So you don't know who it is, do you? We know it ended up like this. Not exactly the kind of picture you're used to, mr. Gray. You have no idea what i'm used to, detective. There's another man involved: rob dow. Both were tow truck drivers. They're tow truck drivers? My bethany would never be involved with tow truck drivers. Mr. Gray, when we showed up at your house, Your wife wanted to know if it might be about your daughter. Has bethany been in trouble before? She's not in trouble now. My bethany is a good girl. She lives at home. Sounds to me like you're looking for a bad girl. You know, i know bad girls. In my business... Oh, i know a lot of bad girls. My bethany isn't one of 'em. "I know bad girls." Yeah, i'll bet he knows bad girls. Do men have to be disgusting? I mean Isn't there, like, an operation you guys can get? I think they're working on a pill. What did those transcripts say about where bethany lived? Uh, "was on campus, living at home now." What about the tennis? "Played two years, and then i had to leave." Let's go see why bethany left school. Maybe she's not such a good girl. Bethany's name is listed on the lease here, but she lives at home? We split the rent here before her dad pulled her out of school. Do you know her dad knows bono? Why did her dad pull her out of school? Because of what happened with her professor. His wife kinda walked in, and they were kinda on his desk? Stop. She's got problems. - What kind of problems? - Her dad. He's always telling her stuff he shouldn't. - What kind of stuff? - Like what a tough guy he is. The groupies he used to bang. And what happened to the professor? Oh... He walks with a cane now. Nathan gray... born nathan gratowitz. A few possessions, convictions, some assault beefs. Now he runs gray scale music. Now he's all clean. His daughter bethany has got a little jacket too. Duis, driver's license suspended, probation. And then last year she goes off And has an affair with her humanities professor. - What kind of an affair? - Online and in bed. When nathan reads the emails between his daughter and her teacher, He takes bethany's computer away, - He takes a bat to the teacher's knees. - Paid him to drop the charges. If bethany's back online and her father finds out... Wow, there really is a bethany. I've gotta rethink a lot of things. Press nathan. Excuse me. Excuse me! Oh... oh, detective. You know, i thought you might come back. What, you took a look at my jacket And thought you'd like another poke at nathan? Well, if you want to talk to me, you go through them. Bodyguards? Lawyers. He does that. Studying for your orals? - When was this taken? - Last year. She was so messed up. An athlete blasted all the time. It was all over the web. Her dad based a cd cover on it. Yeah. Messed up. Even if he does know bono. You could have just sent the key. - Not everything in there is yours. - Why, you don't trust me? I didn't know what to do with it, so i just kept it. Hard to believe everything we had fit into this tiny space. Well, not everything. Hey, there's my drunken clown. There they are. I've been looking for these. I got a new case today. Some record producer guy. Got me thinking about my old albums. Got me thinking about a lot of things. Yeah, i remember that. - What? - You used to talk to me about the job - When you came home. - Sorry. It's okay. And not all of these albums are yours. This one was mine. And this one. And that one was yours. That was not mine. I would never listen to that. Not only did you listen to it, But you listened to it over and over again. That's our bed. Yes...it is. But, uh... We're not gonna think about that. No? We're not gonna think about that. We're not gonna think about me kissing you. No... we're not gonna think about you kissing me. We're not gonna think about me... - Touching you. - No. We're not gonna think about you... Touching me. I'm not thinking about it. Neither am i. Lock up when you're done. Yeah. Yeah, i know. - One, that's inappropriate. - Why? Because you're my boss. And two... If you read my file, you'd see that i was in the program. - Why would i read your file? - Because you're my boss. I don't like files. Too wordy. Come on. So we'll get a fake beer. And maybe we'll get fake drunk And end up having fake drunk sex, what do you say? I'd say that idea's repulsive. Those are the very first words each of my three wives spoke to me. And they all changed their minds. It's twisted. He gets some model to play his daughter on an album cover. It'll make me buy it, but it's well and truly twisted. We've been looking for someone obsessive and violent. You want to go see nathan. Nathan's all lawyered up. Then let's go see nathan's girls. Okay, so, maya, why are you in this class? I'm taking every class. You're taking every class in the business school? By the time i graduate, i'll have done exactly that. Yes, sir. Wow. O... okay. What about you... - Vairam? - I have a top secret business plan. Are... are you gonna be working on it in the class? - Yes. - Great, well, why don't we discuss... I will not discuss my business. It is a secret business. Move on. Uh, well, that just leaves you, ed. I'd like to learn how to do that thing Where if somebody tells you it's in the constitution That you don't have to pay taxes, then you don't have to pay taxes. That's not in the constitution. Wesley snipes did it. Yeah. Hey. - I'm on my way out. - Nice car. Bethany, you ever see what happens when a car goes through the crusher? Ever see what happens when a man goes through the crusher? It kind of looks like strawberry jelly or lasagna. Or strawberry jelly and lasagna. Is that supposed to shock me? I've seen it before. - Plenty of times. - It's not you, but it's you. - Like i said, i'm on my way out. - I'll go with you. Yeah, okay. Whatever. Come on. Good. All right. You used to be a singer? Looked you up. You know, you had that one album out, and then nothing. It's how you and your husband met, though, right? In the recording studio? Hey, how come you stopped singing after you got married? Nathan didn't like it? I stopped singing because i wanted to. To raise my daughter. Ah, bethany, yeah. Lovely girl. Strong swing. Bethany, did you go online to get away from your father? I wasn't online. It wasn't me. I stopped drinking. I stopped doing that. - I'm in the real world now. - If it wasn't you online, Then the person we're looking for is not you. Any idea who's not you, bethany? That could be anyone. Well, the things they knew about you, i... I think it's closer to home. Maybe you want to ease up a little. You spend a lot of time with these kids? Yes. They need me. Nothing wrong with being needed, is there? What about computers, lynn? Can you think of anybody who would need one of those? You're saying someone out there is pretending to be me? Someone i know. And because of that... Someone is dead. You know, i tried to be good. I came home. I left that world. I'm in the real world now. - I am. I am. - You are? Okay, yes, you are! You know your husband is prone to violence. And his relationship with your daughter? I mean, if he thought bethany was online again... Nathan was with me. Our club dance. I really have to get back to work. You miss it? Singing? I never even think about it. Someone close to me. Someone who knows me, Out there pretending to be me. Someone like... Bethany, slow down. Maybe you can drive now. Reese, how'd it go? My guess, both of nathan's girls Are gonna take a hard look at daddy. Why do you need a ride? Did you lose another car? Crews. Detective crews? She's speaking. Excuse me? Rachel. She is speaking. Hello, jack. How come every time you come around - Somebody ends up getting hurt? - What are you doing here, jack? He came to say good-Bye. So now you're the one not talking? You take care of yourself, kid. Jack! You know where she is, but you didn't tell 'em? How come you didn't tell 'em where she is, jack? You've been protecting her from them? I've always been protecting her. You've gotten in too deep, haven't you, jack? Maybe i can help you get out. Not for nothing, jack. "It was six. "It is five. But it could just as easily be four." Who set me up, jack? Yeah, okay. I'm a lot of things, detective crews, but i'm no rat. Who are they, jack? I do want to thank you for finding the man that killed that girl's family. For putting him away. But ever since you got out of jail, crews, All i've been doing is cleaning up your mess. But it's your mess. So you can clean it up. Reese. Crews. Bethany. Since you talked to my mother, she hasn't stopped crying. Why is she crying, bethany? Because there were two hours at that party Where my mother couldn't find my father. She's so scared. Nathan has no alibi. Let's go pick him up. Did my father kill that man? I just googled you. You were in jail. You looted pension funds. I wouldn't put it like that. How would you put it? Yeah... I did things i'm not proud of. And i did my time. But before all of that, i was a good businessman, And i made a lot of money for a lot of people. So you're saying what you did was okay? No. No. What i'm saying is that business is a system, And i know how it works. And if any of you would like to learn how it works, Then you will pick up your pencils right now Or get the hell out of my classroom. We have computers, not pencils. There was no mention of pencils. Will we be needing pencils? Gimme a minute? Mrs. Dunn, you want to see me? He wasn't cleaning his gun, detective crews. But it wasn't the other, was it? Jimmy swore he would never leave me. I don't see how it could have been. His name is mickey raybourn. I don't know these other men, but This one... mickey raybourn. - You got a temper, nate. - Yeah. Yeah, i do Makes me real good at my job. Real good in other places too. Don't talk to me like i'm one of the groupies you used to bang. Used to. Not anymore. You're a family man now, right, nate? Got a wife and a daughter. Are you out there online pretending you're something You're not, nathan? Is that how you get off now, nathan? - No, i don't need to do that. - You don't? No. If i need that thing, I need to taste it, i need to touch it. You know, i need to feel the skin, the flesh. I don't need to pretend to be somebody, sweetheart. When you're with nathan, you're with nathan. May i see my lawyers now, please? Where's your partner? She said something about going to take a shower to wash nathan off. He's got no alibi, but we got no witness, no weapon, no confession. Rob dow still has a secret. And now it's time for him to tell us. Yeah? How you gonna do that? Freakshow actually seems to enjoy lockup. He does seem to enjoy it, doesn't he? The question is why? Look at him, he looks like he's gonna be rewarded For keeping that secret. Rob dow isn't sharing his secret with us, But he's waiting for someone to share it with. If we want rob dow to share the secret... Are you thinking about what i'm thinking about? About reese in the shower? No. How come no one out here treats me like a commanding officer? We do. And as my commanding officer, i'm thinking i need you to let me Sign someone out of lockup. This is it, rob. She's here. Here in the same room as you. Breathing the same air as you. It's real. Anything you want to say, now's your chance. You said you wanted to talk to me? I don't want you to worry. - I'm gonna take care of everything, okay? - Stop talking. Bethany, Is there anything that you want to say to me now? What would i want to say to you? What you wrote to me all those times. I don't know you. But i saw you. That wasn't me. I was here tuesday night. Mike's phone rang. I heard him say your name, bethany. He went outside, and then i saw you. I stood at the window. I couldn't even breathe. I saw you hit him with the racket. You hit him so hard that it broke. I tried to clean it all up out there in the dark. I will help you with this. All you have to do is just say that you love me, And i will take it all back. If you saw me, Would you know me? I look for you wherever i go. Bethany, When we go back to your house, Will we find a broken tennis racket? That was in the emails off rob's computer. Bethany sent it to rob. Bethany? Bethany wasn't born when this picture was taken. You looked a lot like your daughter back then. Probably still do in the right light. The party at your club... You and nathan took separate cars. He was coming from work. Mrs. Gray, is that a new tennis racket? There are uniforms searching your house right now. They're gonna find your old racket, aren't they? The one you hit mike brody with. When we brought bethany back from school, After all her troubles, I was the one to close her computer accounts. I took one look. I wanted to see what she'd been doing. I just took one look. - What did you see? - I saw a whole world in there. There's a whole world out here. Not for me. See, i used to be bethany. But i'm not bethany anymore. But in there... I was bethany again. Mike loved me. Online, on the phone. I went to see him dressed just like this. I thought that's what he wanted. But when he saw me... He just laughed. I didn't mean to kill him. It's just that he laughed. He said i wasn't bethany. Don't ever grow old.
