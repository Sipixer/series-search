Driver's license. Lisa robards. Got a business card too. "Unending notes." "Sentiments for all occasions." We're looking for someone who knows-- boxes.Would that be you? Yeah, that'S... And you are? Uh, john armstrong. What can you put in a box, john? Whatever you want. What is that exactly? Kumquat. Little gem of the citrus family. Got a box for that? Yeah. You sure? You don't seem sure. No. I'm--I'm sure. What else can you put in a box? Well, you can-- we can box up anything you want, really. I mean... in prison, I knew a guy who escaped by mailing himself out in a box. Prison? Why were you in prison? You got a box big enough for that? Big enough to fit a man? Uh, I don't understand.Why would I-- or a woman? Who are you people? Detectives. Lapd. Detectives. He said he done time. Trippy, huh? You need some help boxing that kumquat? Uh, look, to be honest, I don't usually work the counter.So that's-- what is it that you usually do? Uh, custom cards, invitations, announcements. Sentiments for all occasions. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Sentiments for all occasions. And who usually works the counter? My boss. Lisa robards. When was the last time you saw your boss, john? Yesterday. Uh, she's usually here first thing. But she's running a little late today. So that'S... why I'M... you're not here to box the kumquat, are you? Mrs. Price? I saw it on the news. Just one more L.A.Story, right? Nothing to do with me. And then those policemen came. The ones in uniform out there. You're policemen, too? My name's detective crews. This is detective reese. We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am. Can you tell me, was glenn alive when he was put in that box? the coroner hasn't made his report yet, but-- but you saw glenn. Can't you tell if he was-- most likely, glenn died from suffocation. Most likely glenn was alive when he was put into that box. Thank you. Do you need anything else, ms. Price? No. Uh, thank you very much, susan. You and your husband worked together? Uh, glenn and i were both partners. Power couple. Can you think of anyone who'd want to harm your husband? Do you know if your husband knew a woman named "lisa robards"? I don't know that name. She owned a stationary store in hollywood. You said she owned? - Was she-- - one of the others?Yes. Was she alive too when she... The news said there were three. There was no id on the first victim. We're still waiting to see if her prints are in the system. The news said they found her in the river. They call it a river, but there's no water in it. They shouldn't call it a river if there's no water in it. Why'd you tell her her husband was alive when he went in that box? 'Cause she asked me. Something you want to ask me? {\a6}<i>Kyle.....</i> did it bother you that charlie crews served 12 years for those murders you did? My lawyer says I can't talk about stuff like that and whatnot. but you've confessed to kille seg thybolt family. Confessed to a crime that charlie crews went to jail for. Well, like they say, if they locked him up, he must've done something. The first vic had a work visa. Immigration had her prints and her place of employment in the system. Brandee huggens. Detectives. Someone here wants to talk to you. My name's oscar tollander. I work at megaluggage. We sell suitcases, carry-ons, garment bags, trunks. What kind of trunks? Like the ones I te onhe news. Last month, a guy comes in for trunks. Paid for his order in cash. What did he look like? I couldn't say. Hat pulled low, big sunglasses. - How many trunks were in that order? - Ten. He picked up an order of ten trunks. - reese.She's in a-- - box. Did brandee go in there? We all go in there. Did brandee seem to mind it? what do you think? Go check it out for yourself. Customers like it. Oh yeah. The guys eat it up. Any customers like it more than the others? no. It seems to be something every man can agree on. Us in there. any customers into brandee more than the others? You know, just maybe a-- maybe a little too into her? She never mentioned anything. Whose idea was that box? its always been here. A lot of places have them. Some places have a cage. Some places have a box. I guess you don't go to the clubs. Oh, it's been a while. Brandee would've liked you. Yeah? Why's that? Because you seem kind of broken. What was your relationship with brandee? Uh, I met her the day she walked in here. She just came down from vancouver. Do you know if she had any troubles outside of the club? No, no. She had that canadian thing, you know? What would that be? Happy for no reason. I think my partner might not be familiar with that concept. Brandee, uh, she ever mention the names "lisa robards" or "glenn price"? Those the other two who were killed? Something else you need to tell me? She wanted to be an actress. She just got a line in some movie. she walked around all day practicing that line. Remember? "I never seen a sky that blue." New boss wants to see us. Alright. Great. Thanks, fellas. Yeah! Lots of dark nights of the soul spent on this baby. I brought it out with me. I understand you were close with the last occupant of this office? Friend of the family. Yeah. Real shame about her getting demoted and all. It happens. And I know all about you and your, uh, off-the-book investigations, conspiracy theories. Look, I don't know what was going on while I was still living in the united states of new york city. But the only conspiracy I'm interested in is the possibility that my wife and girlfriend know about each other and are out to get me. You want us to look into that? No, but I do want you to give me the punch line to this joke. An investment banker, a card shop owner, and a stripper each go into a box. Now before you get all offended and say "it's not a joke," let me tell you, I know it's not a joke. Well, as far as we can tell, the victims had nothing in common. They didn't know each other. No one who knew them seem to know each other. Different parts of L.A. Different social brackets. Different worlds. No criminal records. No tax problems. Neighbors had no complaints. If any of them were worried about their safety, they never talked to the law about it. Three people chosen at random? Except nothing is random. Oh, here we go. And why is that? Because everything is connected. I don't think that's true. Why on earth would that be true? What about, uh... where they were found? Freeway, rooftop, river.Nothing links those places, but-- they're public. They took time. They're deliberate. Whoever's doing this is making a show of it. Tox screens on victims? Clean. The coroner confirms it. All three went into those trunks alive then suffocated. Slowly over the course of several hours. So how'd they get there? So how did they get there? That's what I'm asking. You heard me ask that, right? Maybe it's not who they were. It's where they were. Did he just... he just walked out, right? You surf? 'Cause I was thinking about checking it out. And I figured if you surf, maybe you can give me a few lessons. I don't surf. Reese. Come on. Come on! Alright, kung fu. I'm open. Hit me. glenn price, investment banker. Brand-new m5 with gps. Yellow line's glenn price's last week of driving. Lisa robards, card shop owner. Two year old prius with gps. Red line's lisa's last week of driving. They were both right there. At the same time. What is that place? Public park. And the stripper? Dancer. Go-go dancer. Brandee huggens. Didn't have a car. Took the subway. There's no subway in L.A. Yeah, there is. People ride on it. So we don't know where brandee huggens went. But the other two went right here. Funny what that bartender said about brandee being happy for no reason. Do you think it's possible? To be happy for no reason? I think I don't want to think about that. Yeah, but to not think about it means that you are thinking about it. Because the "it" that you're not thinking about is the "it" that... "I've never seen a sky that blue." Okay, now you're just saying stuff. Sentiments for all occasions. Reese. Look at that. You're not about to leave, are you? I got another park to go to. Schedule, you know. Sure. Schedule. Just let me, uh, buy one before you take off. Come on. Do you have any fruit? It's an ice cream truck. - Any fruit ice cream? - Strawberry. Is that real strawberry or the artificial strawberry flavor? I don't like the artificial kind. I don't know. I could check. No, never mind. How 'bout mango ice cream? Got anything like mango? you okay? You just--I don't know, seem a little shaky. Yeah. Just cold. The coolers. Uh, I don't think we have any mango. Or papaya? Guava? Kiwi? Tamarind? I don't know what your friend on the floor here is planning on doing, but I'm going to count to three and then I plan on shooting him. One. Be smart. Don't move. You didn't say "three"! You didn't even get to three! You shot me on two! You didn't even get to three! He's right, you know. You didn't get to three. I rounded up. Crack, huh? Those brainiacs were slinging crack off the ice cream truck. But their not good for the killings. They both got out of county this morning. I got you for sellin' smoke in a school zone! Dude, you were out for what, like 12 hours? Come on! Buh-bye! Good work, you two. I do hate crack. you got a little... ice cream right in the... corner of your... yeah. Uh, I'm gonna head back to the precinct. Station. Precinct, station. New york, L.A. There's someone out there with seven trunks left. And I still don't know what the banker and the card shop owner were doing in this park together. - It's automatic. - Thank you. - It's not automatic. - Thank you. lucky. Coming. That ice cream guy you arrested, he was dealing drugs? Crack? I bring my son here. A lot of people bring children here. Do you come here a lot? Every day when it's nice. It's L.A. So, you know, it's always nice. Would you mind looking at a few pictures? these are the ones from the news that they found in those boxes? Yes. Do you remember seeing any of these people here at the park? Can you imagine being closed up like that? It's like a nightmare. Him. I saw him here. Last week over by that statue. I-I saw him. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Because a man with no kids... my "mom radar" goes up. Well, what was he doing? Having his picture taken. She was taking it. Do you remember seeing her here? No. Just these two. The investment banker's having an affair with the card shop owner. Uh, the wife finds out and kills them both. And puts them in a box? - What about the dancer? - The stripper. Glenn price was an investment banker, crews. I mean, I'm pretty sure his tastes weren't exclusive to card shop owners. He's doing the stripper. The wife finds out. And puts her in a box? Thanks. The wife's not answering any of her phones. A unit rolled by the house, no one's home. But security at the building's got her going in the office. At night? ********* I don't know either of these women. Neither do I. you think glenn was seeing this lisa robards woman? They were seen together. Yes. If I would've known, I would have been happy for him. We were dissolving our personal relationship. Differences in lifestyle? Clearly. I want things... need things... glenn had no interest in. Did it make you angry that he wouldn't give you what you need? We loved each other. But... love has nothing to do with need. That's right. He'd taken a job in london. It was a big step up. He was going to try to be happy. We--we both were. can I ask you something? You wanted to know if glenn was still alive when he went into that box. Do you think he went in there for you? The way glenn was found... the kind of things I want, I wondered, did he go looking for something to make me happy? Did he go looking for something and end up... does everyone have a secret? You wanna know mine? Which one? You know which one. The one about my father? The one about my father having something to do with... you going to prison for 12 years? - Reese-- - did I say I wanted to know? {\a6}<i>Constance........</i> can I ask you about the girl? Which girl? The daughter of the murdered family. Rachel seybolt. She went into children's services... when she was nine. Was adopted when she was 11. And then she disappeared. I don't know anything about that. Is detective crews looking for her? I think I hired every private investigator in los angeles. Any idea what that costs? Money is not a man's worth, ted. It hurts me when you talk like that. 700,000 it costs. Those are dollars. Ted, I have 50 million dollars. More than that, actually. I've grown it. Okay, they, uh, they tracked rachel here. From what the pis co uld tell, that's where jack was holding her. Then they lost her. She vanished. So is this what it's like to be a cop? It's more fun with this. Can I help you? we need to ask you some questions. Can I help you? I run this house. There's problem? Uh, we're looking for a girl. What country from is she? She's american. She'd been injured. We have foreigners only. If she's american, she's not been here ever. Well, we'll just take a look around. You hold any magic mushroom? Magic mushrooms? We--we're cops! Then grass? Charlie, she's not here. Ted, this seem like a really strange place to hold someone captive? our fourth victim. Kurt ruiz. Just 18 years old. Found at the airport. - Connection to the other three? - None. He wasn't seen in that park. This kid, he grew up in eagle rock, nowhere near the others. He's younger too. He was a senior in high school. Kind of a track star. He had a full ride to run for ucsd next year. That kid had everything to live for. What did you say? Yeah, I know. We all have everything to live for, right? No. Not like this kid. And... is he gonna walk out again? It's not... where they were. It's not what they were. What if it's what they were about to be? Yeah, and what would that be? They were about to be happy. Just got a full scholarship. Just got her first line in a movie. New job. New life in london. What did his wife say to us? That we're gon-- gonna try to be happy. Okay, grasshopper. But what about lisa robards? The card shop owner? How is she about to be happy? Let's go find out. John. Detective kumquat. - You packin' up? - Yeah. With lisa gone, we'll have to close. john, do you ever remember seeing lisa with this man? Or mentioning his name, glenn price? It's possible. I don't know. Lisa and I didn't really mix socially. But you and lisa worked together, right? I mean, long hours in the store. And people who work together know more about each other than most married couples. You know, relationships. What their hopes are. Secrets. I'm sorry I-I haven't seen this guy. I wish I could help you. John, do you know if lisa was planning a change in her life? What kind of change? Oh, new job. New home. Something to make her happy. No. If she did, she didn't mention it to me. I mean, we only worked together. okay. Thank you. You know, if you think of anything that might be helpful, just give us a call. Sentiments for all occasions? Invitations? Announcements? Excuse me? That's what you do, right, john? Invitations. Announcements. So if there was a graduation party for a high school kid, you might do the invites. Well, if it were special enough. Sure. Full ride to ucsd special enough? I don't understand. A full ride? Or a moving announcement? Some guy gets a new job; a new life. - You know what my partner's thinking? - You know what I'm thinking? Is that when people are happy, they want to celebrate. And when they want to celebrate, they need to let people know. Invitations. Announcements. John. You're going to wanna see my customer list. Yeah. I'd like to see it too. I can't find it anywhere. Lisa left the business in such a mess, I don't really know what's what around here. Okay, john. Well, you find that list, you send it right over to us, okay? Sure thing, detective. I got your "person of interest." well, you watch him. I wanna know everywhere he goes. He leaves, you go with him. Do not lose him. There may be another trunk out there. I'm on it, detective. Everywhere he goes, I go. You have my solemn vow I will not lose him. We don't need the customer list. If the victims had their invitations made at unending notes, I'm pretty sure we know some of the people they sent them to. You're not closing, are you? Yeah. It--it's my birthday. I'm--I'm off to the party. Everyone's coming. You know. But it's the middle of the day. No. Not my birthday. My, uh, anniversary-- that's why I have to... no. I'm--I'm moving. Yeah. Overseas. Ow, u knlondon. Uh, uh, a new start. A new job. New life for me. I have to go. I'm getting married. Happiest day of my life. Unending notes. Does that mean anything? It means somebody lied to me. Well, I guess they're in trouble then. I guess they are. You got him there, bobby? your boy did not come out of the ore,charlie. He's in there. Thanks, bobby. Got your warrant right here. Guess what. He's not the only armstrong lives in the building. His mother lives right downstairs. Maybe she's got a key. Is it always the guy who lives with his mom? I've never seen a sky that blue. I've never seen a sky-- - I've never seen a sky... - who is this girl? that's brandee huggens. Has my john done something to her? I've never seen a sky that blue. I've never seen a sky that blue.

"Come celebrate my big break." "It's one line; but it's my line." Oh and here's the one you did for glenn price. Look, there he is on the front. Standing by that statue.

Gettin' married. Full-ride scholarship. When was the last time you were happy, john? Look, here's the one you did for your boss, john. For lisa. Birthday party.

And you are not going to be happy there. You will never be happy there. How is that going to be any different than the rest of my life? It's going to be different, john. Believe me. But we have something for you. Something you want. What's that? You can be happy. Here. Right now. You can be a hero, john. You can save that girl. you wanna be happy, john? You've wanted it your whole life. Now here's your chance. But you have to take it before she dies. No. You don't understand. What I did to those people. It made me smile. And the thought of that girl... out there... in a box... right now... well, that just makes me smile too. His mother? What could his mother possibly say to him? It's what he could say to her. Tell them where the trunk is, john. You can't make me do that. Tell them where the trunk is, john. It's okay, mom. No. Don't be sad. It's okay. It's a smile. It's all one big smile. What'd you say there, john? The building downtown. Where we found lisa robards. Here. That's where we found kurt ruiz. The L.A.River basin. Where we found brandee. The 405 freeway. Where we found glenn price. It's all one big smile. We wanna find the girl, we look right here. Could you imagine spending time in a box like that? Nice. Oh, because of him being in the... yeah. He's lucky to have you as a partner. I hope to have someone in my life like that someday. - What? - What? I know you care about her, kyle. I know you want rachel to be safe. You don't know nothing. I know you're afraid. You've been locked up. You know all they got in this place is fear. No. You're afraid of something. Someone else. Is it jack reese? Never heard that name. Captain jack reese, kyle. You worked for him. You killed for him. I never heard that name. Until you spoke it just now. Listen, hollis. We both know you told me you worked for jack reese. I killed those people because I wanted to. No one made me. You're afraid of what he'll do. My life's in the lord's hands. You're afraid of what jack reese will do to her. Then help me find rachel. You? You stay away from that girl. The lord told me to sav cthathild. The lord sent me to take her from foster care to atone for what I'd done to her family. To atone for the blood that I had shed. The fire of the lord spoke to me! The fire said, "raise that child as my own." Said, "shed my love on her even as I'd shed the blood of her kin." You stay away from her. You stay away from her! Stay away from her! you spend a lot of time in a small space, you know, like a cell, you get a feeling for the size of a room. How big or small it is. I remember that. This room, ted. It's smaller than the room on either side. Charlie. It's okay, rachel. It's okay. Stop it! No! No! The fire sent me. The fire sent me. The fire sen meto get you. To take you from here.
