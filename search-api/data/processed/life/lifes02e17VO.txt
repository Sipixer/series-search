- Yeah, I do. Close the door. Get the blinds. The blinds, yeah. Close all the blinds. I need you to stomp on my foot. - You need me to stomp on your foot? - Yeah. It's asleep. - My foot's asleep. - Asleep? Hate it when that happens. It'll be awake all night now. Are you gonna stomp on my foot or not? Come on. Give it more than that. - Anything? - Nothing. Take it up a notch. My second wife, she was really good at this. Must have been something about her shoes. - What about Reese? - I'm bringing her along. Got a tingle. Do it again. Now I'm feeling it. One more time. Ah, yeah! There it is. Yeah. There's a dead guy at the beach. Dead guy. - What was... - Don't ask. - Do all detectives have to do that? - Bobby, let's go to the beach. Anybody see anything? Runner, he was coming through the crowd. Then he just dropped. Big blade, hmm. Buck knife? Looks serrated. He just dropped? Stabbed through the heart. - Turned him off like a light. - Robbery gone wrong? Shove a victim, slit his pockets, knife slips. Well, he's got no pockets to slit. No pockets. So, no I.D. You go out for a run, you lock the door, right? Don't run much. That much. No pockets. You lock the door, where do you put the key? The Sea Sprite. Ocean front motel. Out-of-towners love this zoo. What's not to love? Clearly you are not a parent. Out-of-towners on vacation. Not on vacation. On leave. Army. If our dead guy is one of 'em, that leaves three more. Oh. One of 'em's a real little guy. Or not a guy at all. What? Can I help you with something? Those are nice sunglasses. You get those on the beach. You get a lot of sunglasses on the beach. It's sunny there. I'm gonna ask you again. Can I help you with something? Well, you can start by telling your two friends behind us to put their hands in the air and get down on their knees. Relecture/Resynchro: grischka, lafeelicita, salomon SeriesSub.com Dixon Sims, Andy Stiller, Erin Cordett. All active duty U.S. Army. Back from Iraq. In L.A. On leave. - And the victim? - Travis Slocum. They all surf together and they all came here together. I only count three beds. All four staying in this room? Said they could only afford the one room, so they rotated, taking turns on the floor. What about that diversion attack they pulled on you two? Said they saw strangers in their room. Training just kicked in. I don't mean to sound unpatriotic, but I see a cute girl sharing a room with three boys and now one of the boys is dead. Well, they all alibi each other. Said they were all hanging at the pool while Slocum went for his run. What? - What? - It's just... - Reese told me to... - Reese told you to what, captain? Reese told me to make sure I always ask you what you see. Ah, she said that, did she? So? What do you see? Actually, it's what I don't see. She said he might say that. You're not wearing dog tags? You're all still on active duty, right? How come you took off your tags? When a policeman takes off his badge, in my experience, it usually means he's up to no good. I see those tags. Took 'em off because we're not over there just now. Because we just wanted to be here for two weeks. Operation: fun and sun. Wouldn't expect you to understand. Okay. Listen. My captain out there... He sees a pretty girl and you fellas in this room, he's thinking jealousy. Not robbery. Travis and us? We surf together. Kick major ass together. Wouldn't expect you to understand. You don't expect a lot, do you? I get what I get, and I don't get upset, sir. Travis Slocum. We're gonna have to take this with us. I'll make sure these get where they need to go. It's okay, Andy. Detective Crews will be respectful with that. Won't you, sir? They're all from the midwest. They all saw heavy action in Iraq. This, however, is their first time in L.A. Dirty clothes. Dirty clothes, dirty clothes. A souvenir glass with the letters "a. F.O." Stenciled on it. Does not mean "Air Force One." We should find out where this came from. Where there's drinking, there's arguments. Arguments, there's violence. Got a lightweight protective vest in good condition. Very light. And... And what? A medal for exceptional valor. Sadr city, Iraq, april 12, 2008. Victim was a hero. And tidwell thinks it's about the girl? In the united states of new york city, where there's a dead guy, there's a girl there somewhere. - Well, what do you think? - Well, I think you put a knife into Slocum's heart like that, you need traing to get that close without being seen, or - he needs to know you, so... - So you can get that close without causing any alarm. - And travis' buddies... - Knew him and had the training. Hey, Reese. Reese, you said something nice about me to Tidwell, huh? No, I didn't. You know, Reese. With distance, you're appreciating me more. Reese? Reese? Well, that's just rude. You know she's not here, right? You get the video? Yeah. It should be up now. You can't see Reese here in this room, can you? I mean, is she... Is she here now? So many people. Can't tell who got close to him and who didn't. Nobody saw him get stabbed. Nobody even noticed him till he fell. Nobody saw anything. I showed these pictures to everybody. I even talked to the human statue. - Oh, yeah? What'd he say? - It was a girl. Said she didn't really look at the faces staring at her. - What's she looking at? - Watching films in her head. Godfather III today. - Isn't that the worst one? - Yeah. Since she watched the other two, she likes to finish things, and... Slocum runs into this crowd alive, and he comes out dead. How do you kill a guy like that? Okay. I'm Slocum. I'm jogging this way. What... I just come up, stick you in the chest? Battle-tested soldier? Doesn't seem right. You don't see Reese again, do you? Is she here now, Charlie? How do you kill a guy like that? He's been stabbed by... Here, maybe, two, three seconds. Wind it back. - You can't see him now. - We're not looking for him. He gets stabbed right about... now. There. Look at that. See the musician here? She's turning up her amp. This vendor spills his ice. And these two guys here at the table, they start pushing each other. All at the same time. He said it was performance art. - He asked you to argue? - When we got a text, we started. Same with you? Yeah, he did. He said it was performance art. He gave me $100. Paid you, too? What'd he look like? White guy, sunglasses, hoodie. Could be. But, uh, like he said, he had a hoodie and sunglasses. - You rember anything else? - Yeah, he was a tough sale. You tried to sell him something? Big bad bertha. Since he had all that money. But I couldn't get him to buy it. - You get him to touch it? - I did. Always put the merchandise in their hands. First rule of sales. You want to get that dusted for prints? I do. A diversion. Get Slocum's attention going one way, Then push that knife right in his heart and no one sees it. Or the killer. We've seen a diversion before, haven't we? Let's try this again. Do you know this man? Yes. You know his name? - Mickey Rayborn. - How do you know Mickey Rayborn? I've seen him in the papers. - The stories about his murder? - Yes. Do you know him in any other way besides the stories in the paper? Yes. In what other way do you know Mickey Rayborn? He was some kind of famous cop before I got on the force. Do you know Mickey Rayborn in any other way besides for him being some kind of famous cop? - Yes. - In what way would that be? Detective, your answers will not be used against you. The bureau needs to know your secrets so no one... Will use them against me. - That's right. - Yeah. In what other way do you know Mickey Rayborn, then? He and my father were friends. They were both cops? Yes. And where is your father now? I don't know. He took off. There is a detail left out of the newspaper articles about Rayborn's death. Do you know what it is? No. His body was never found. As a detective, what's that mean to you? All that blood in the water nearby, um... I'm guessing he was butchered. Butchered. Do you know this man? Damn it, I can't do it. - Watch movies in your head? - Mmm. Takes practice. I used to be really good at it. - When you were inside? - Mm-hmm. - Godfather III? - No. Home movies. I'm guessing that must have hurt. I'm guessing that's why I watched 'em. Take a look at that. Where is she going dressed like that? Why'd they take their dog tags off? That's, like, a giant private jet. Come on. Let's follow her. Don't have a warrant or a ticket. Come on, the door's open. We can just walk on. That plane, you don't need a ticket if you look like you have a ticket. No, Charlie, you don't need a ticket because you look like you have a ticket. Me? I need a ticket. Okay. Keep your phone on. I'll call you when I land. Jerry, that number's a joke. Jerry, that number's so small I can't even see it. Wait, wait, do I see it? No. It's too small. False alarm. Bye, jerry. Jerry. Cell phone. Cell phone, sir. Thank you. Welcome to air fun one. - A. f. O. - Is there anything else you'd like? Well, if it's a specific question, I don't need anything, but if it's a more general question... Excuse me. Sometimes I think I don't need anything, but I do. I just don't know it. Well, is this what I need? I need you off this plane. You're not supposed to be here. You're not supposed to be here, either. Why'd you take your dog tags off, Erin? You know why. I'm working security. - Which is against army regs. - I need the money. I've been making less than minimum wage for two years. A lot less. We all have. Everyone? You've got to be seated. Uh, one moment please. I'm just having some trouble with my... Fastener. I... okay. Listen. Travis was working this plane. You're working this plane. Anything you think I should know about what happens on this plane? The service called me this morning. They thought travis flaked. I didn't say what happened to him. It's none of their business. I need the money. That's why we came. But now travis is dead. Yeah. Travis is dead. But I still need the money. Erin, where's this plane going? It doesn't really go anywhere. So it's just a flying party where people get contracts signed? Why'd they take our phones? Because they all have cameras in 'em now. You can sit there for takeoff. What if I don't know the way I want what I want? You don't know what you want. Maybe I can help you figure it out. Gus Wilvern. Chemxtech. Vice president, customer relations. And you are? Really, really enjoying this plane. Well, you'd have a disorder if you weren't. - And your name is? - Charlie Crews. - That Charlie Crews? - No, this Charlie Crews. Eh, falsely-accused Charlie Crews. No, detective Charlie Crews. - You look a lot different in person. - I am a lot different in person. A lot different in person. That's excellent. I gotta ask you, though, - who'd you come on board with? - Oh, just me. And this murder investigation I got going on. Slocum worked security for you. Temp. Didn't show up this morning. Our Slocum. Murdered. Here, after everything he'd been through. Maybe you wanna go easy. Just one more bottle. They're very tiny. We have the big ones. People seem to prefer the little ones. Just nostalgia, I guess. Why did travis work here? Oh, these kids... They get paid nothing on active duty. I try and help 'em out when they're on leave. - Between me and them. - So you pay 'em under the table? They're not supposed to moonlight. - It's better for 'em. - And you. Anything that happens up here. They can't talk about, can they? - What would happen up here? - Gus, you've got grown men up here walking around dressed up as cowboys and gladiators. Some guys like to fly around and play poker. Some guys like to fly around and play dress up. I don't judge. It's easier that way. Any guys like to fly around and play rough? Travis Slocum see something happen up here that wasn't poker or dress up? Something he just couldn't keep quiet about? Are you implying I'm trying to get away with something? Not implying, Gus. You are getting away with something. You, uh, clearly don't understand chemxtech's relationship with the troops, detective. We have programs providing housing for vets who are homeless... All kinds of outreach. How did you reach out to Slocum? Okay. Let me give you a number. Protectanddefendurself.com. Twice? To go to prison twice? Just lucky, I guess. You have such a positive attitude. The second time wasn't for very long, was it? - Not very long, no. - I don't know about these things, but is it normal to go in and out of jail so quickly? Prison. Not jail. Prison. - And you know what I learned there? - Do tell. I learned that i'm not this charming. - I'm sorry, "this charming"? - This. Your smile. Your laugh. He's not this charming, believe me. - You think this is a joke. - You gotta laugh. Are you finished with these? - Now what? - We laugh. But first... I gotta get back to work. I got Bobby in the car. Tidwell called. I'm back in uniform tomorrow. - He say Reese was coming back? - No. Got you some detective from Valley division. Didn't get a name. So this is your last day? Let's go catch us a killer, then. What have you got, fries in there? Pete Magnus. Gus Wilvern gave us your number. Protect and defend urself, inc. - Who wants to know? - L.A.P.D. - How'd you get in my perimeter? - Your mom. Real friendly. Let us right into your perimeter. Nice knives. - You have no right to be here. - You know how to use 'em? I run an internet-based business. You get security work for troops on leave. Everything I know is out of your realm of authority. Travis Slocum isn't out of our realm of authority. Well, Slocum made enemies. He slipped up. Should've known. A military man must be on guard at all times. And I do mean all times. Travis Slocum was military. You're not exactly military. He give you a hard time? Slocum said the moron who kicked my army application was right. I say bad judgment on his part, bad judgment on theirs, bad judgment breeds bad results. I was never giving Slocum another referral. You don't get out of this room much, do you, Pete? Flatfoot, you'd get your ass fragged in two seconds you ever saw any real action. Fraggedy-ass. You know Erin Cordett? She sent me a text saying Slocum was sick, could she take his job. - She sent you a text? - What a vulture. Why would she be acceptable to the army and not me, huh? You want to show us that text? Or should we make it our realm of authority? Where were you yesterday? I was here. Earning my wages. You may query my mother on that if you wish. Erin lied to you about how she got on that plane. Yeah, she went after travis Slocum's job. Crews. Okay. Got prints off of that bong. We going back to the mel? Quentin Norris? This is the police. We have a warrant for your arrest. Quentin Norris, open up. My god. Hoodie, sunglasses... Quentin Norris. Find a lot of dead junkies in the shower. Something to do with wanting to get clean? Maybe. Well, hello, there. They're grapes. Yeah, but what kind of grape? They're not red flame or thompson or concord or muscadine. It's like all of 'em... Perfect. - Too perfect? - And evidence. Like all this other crapola. So put 'em back. Well, it's juicy. - It's crisp. It's... - A grape? No, I... I don't think it is. So what is it then? Grape-y. Grape-ish. Yo, Charlie. Check this out. New bills. All rolled together. Junkie in the shower didn't look like the kind of guy to cash a paycheck. Bobby. Check this out. Got blood on the blade that matches our victim Slocum and ten grand in a potato chip can. Norris was spreading some of that money around before the killing. - And Norris was military, too? - Before our guys. Desert storm. In the'90s. Dishonorable discharge ten years ago. History of assault, burglary... All drug-related. One combat vet kills another. Everything connected, Crews? Ah, you do miss me, don't you, Reese? How's the F.B.I. treating you? Uh, so far, just security clearance. Oh, The lie detector, huh? Do you want to know how to beat that? - You can beat a lie detector? - Sure, it's easy. You just tell the truth. Reese? Reese? Tox screen came back. The dead junkie... His smack was cut with drain cleaner. So someone paid Norris to kill Slocum, then someone killed Norris. She was on the phone. Stuff I've seen, this doesn't look like a bad way to go. - Friend of yours? - Pretty sure he killed travis. I guess dreams do come true. I was hoping for a sucking chest wound, though. Not drain cleaner? Somebody spiked his needle. It wasn't you, was it? - You'd have shot him. - Sir, yes, sir. Thing is, Erin, "sir, yes, sirs" aside, turns out you're a liar. First you tell us that you're here for sun and fun, but you're working then you tell us the agency called to take travis' job but you called them. Okay, I called. Chemxtech pays best. You know how to beat a lie detector, Erin? Yeah, you tell the truth. Where were you last night when Norris here got his hot shot? In a bar. What bar? We went to a bunch of 'em. All together? That's right. All together. That's how we do it. And it was just cash that made you want to get on that plane? That's right. And it was just cash that made travis Want to get on that plane? That's right. 'cause you see, Erin, we got two dead soldiers. Got lots of dead soldiers. Yeah. But I'm gonna find out why these two died. Well, that's where we're different, detective Crews. We're trained not to ask why. Just gets in the way. Operation: fun and sun. Why'd you need a vest? I don't know why i'm talking to myself. Chemxtech. I'm still talking to myself. Chemxtech. Yeah, this is one of ours. Our polymer coating makes it light, but it's pretty much indestructible. Yeah. See this serial number? This vest is three years old. Looks brand-new. Now, I don't think the soldier who wore it ever took a bullet. See how straight the fibers run? - Where'd you get it? - It was travis Slocum's. And that's hard to believe. Two years in Iraq. Not a scratch. - You sell these to the army? - Oh, still a little pricey. I convinced some friends at the pentagon to outfit a few platoons. Put the merchandise in their hands. First rule of sales. I want to show you something. I'm just gonna step over here to set this up. Some day, you'll be wearing one of these. - When they're cheaper? - More we sell, the cheaper they get. And this is how I sell 'em. You know, lab tests... They're fine. You really want to sell something? You ready for this? How great is that? Look at this. I've done this 115 times. 116 times. 117 times. You can stop that now. I'm gonna get in guinness. No man has ever shot himself more than I have. You want to try? Go ahead. Taste one. It's like nothing... It's nothing. Until I say it's something. We extract the essence of grape and then reformulate the fruit body. - The fruit body? - It has an infinite shelf life. - It's not a grape. - Not until chemxtech says it is. Stays fresh until we inject the flavor. That's not even on the market yet. Beautiful, ain't it? Oh, yeah. It's beautiful. This vest connects travis to chemxtech. A lot of troops wear those vests. These connect Norris to chemxtech. Please do not ask me to go to the d. A. Holding just those grapes. No, these aren't grapes. Just the fruit body. And you won't have to. The dead junkie, Quentin Norris, washed out of the army then bounced around the system. Got help from community outreach paid for by a generous grant from chemxtech. Okay, so everything's connected. The vest and the fruit bodies. But how does it end up in the death of a decorated united states soldier? Decorated, but not a scratch on him. Two years in Iraq, but not a scratch on him. That's what Gus said. Sadr city... You get one of these medals for getting wounded in combat. Now if travis wasn't wounded in combat, then... Whose medal is it? Army sent this... After action report. There weren't always four members. There was a fifth member of this squad in sadr city. Kit weston. Wounded? Killed. Sniper fire. Chest wound. Died while Erin and Sims were carrying him to the chopper. Chest wound? W-wasn't he wearing one of them vests? I mean, Gus showed you. Bullets don't go through 'em, right? Bullets don't go through the vest Gus showed me but... maybe the vest Gus showed me isn't the one they shipped overseas. Their buddy dies because of a bad chemxtech vest. - They come over here to set it right. - All together. That's how they do it. Sorry. Me again. Anybody seen Gus? He's not here. So the party's here, the plane's here, but the host is missing. Security detail is missing, too. I'm looking for returns. Is Gus in his office? Where's Erin and Sims? I'm alive. Yeah, you're alive. Ah, I'm alive. I'm alive! Where's Erin and Sims? - Out that door. - Where does it lead to? Through my private waiting room back out to the hallway. Are they armed? Yeah. They got my guns. They could be in any of those offices. Great to triangulate fire. I'm alive. Yeah, you're alive. But we've still gotta get you out of here. We know he died in sadr city. We know you were holding him when he did. We know he was wearing a chemxtech vest, and I know you asked why, Erin. Then you know you should send Gus into the hall. Can't do that. Wow, Gus. They really don't like you. They broke in. Tied me up. Yeah? What did they want? Were they looking through all your files, Gus? His vest killed kit. Send Gus into the hall. Look, they're out of their minds. Our vests work. They save lives. I mean, you've seen it yourself. - They work. - For two years. They work like a miracle for two years. It'll stop everything for two years. - And then... - They stop stopping everything? But the chemxtech catalog says they got a shelf life of five years. They do. They work for five years. I got a dead friend that says they don't. If you had a problem with the vest, why didn't you file a complaint? I don't think they were looking for a class action suit, Gus. The vests were chemxtech, so we came here on leave. Travis got in the deepest. He got in their computers and traced the sale of the vests to him. - Two days later... - Travis Slocum was dead. You get that junkie Quentin Norris to kill Slocum. - 'cause that's a man's job. - And then you killed Quentin Norris. 'cause that was just drain cleaner. Detective, send him out, or we're gonna come in there and get him. Look, you gotta get me out of here. Backup's still a few minutes away. What do you wanna do, Charlie? What do you... "what do you wanna do"? You wanna get me out of here, that's what you wanna do! Okay. Let's get him out of here. We'll take him down the hall. Put this on. Come on, let's go. Put it on. There's no time for that. Come on. Put it on. This was travis'. Three years old. It's still got two years left in it. Just keep your head down and tucked, hmm? Your vest should stop any fire. Come on, Gus. You shot yourself 117 times. I changed the numbers from two to five. Our lab reports said two years' shelf life, just like the other companies'. The war was only supposed to last six weeks. Six weeks. I mean, who knew we'd still be there six years later? Don't tell me. Tell them. I changed the numbers from two to five. Who knew we'd still be there six years later? I think your leave is probably up. I think it probably is. You asked me here to look at your tv. Well, we've never had one before. What do you think? Also I'd like access to all the files you have on Mickey Rayborn. Let me think about that... no. I know I didn't kill him. I think roman nevikov ordered it done. But you spent a lot of time with Mickey Rayborn and I'd like to see some of what you've seen. Oh, let me think about it again. No. Not no. Yes. That's what I said when I used to make deals. They would say no, and I would say, "not no. Yes." Be that as it may, I'm saying, "not yes. No." Puryer investigations. Quite a business. Wealthy clients. Powerful clients. You know why they use you? My clients use me because of my reputation, detective. Don't you just love that accent? Everything sounds so smart. So if you had no reputation, you would have no business. You got a client who lives there? Come on, you do. I know this kid... Lives with his mom, Loves security, loves computers. Got us your client list... Your whole client list. Put up these cameras, too. Live feed. Oh, look! There he is now. And my client list? What is that? Oh, this is the button that makes me laugh. Do you want to push it? Oh, okay, ted, you... Go ahead. Go ahead, push it. My reputation? My client list. My entire client list. Okay, detective. I've seen your wall. Now let me show you mine. These are our in-house security of Mr. Rayborn. Oh, there you are, being taken out of his car. What about the night he was killed? System had been corrupted that night. Our cameras on his boats were inoperable. What are these? These are images I had taken off Mr. Rayborn's computer. I haven't fully processed these yet. - Who took these? - I don't know. It was possible he was employing secondary security. Stop. Go back. That one, there.
