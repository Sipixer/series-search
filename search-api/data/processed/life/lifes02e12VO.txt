crews. Crews, you here? - Yeah, I'm here. - Well... what do you think? Do you think it's a good idea? Yeah, I think it's a good idea. I think it's a great idea! Think it's a very bad idea. You weren't listening, were you? The one time that I tell you something, and you weren't even listening. what were you saying? just forget it. It's not important. no, it is. If it weren't important, you wouldn't say it's not important. So it--it must be pretty important for you to say that it's not important, right? Okay, I'm thinking about taking the lieutenant's test. There... said iT. I think that's a great idea. It means you're in a confident place in your life, ready for what's next. reese, I'm happy for you. Are you touching me? Execution. Russian ink on those arms. I don't know about that one, but... those twO... full-on russian mob. I'm gonna walk the scene. Mickey rayborn, this is charlie crews. Detective crews. What can I do for you? Funny thing. The other day you told me about an F.B.I.Agent who's in the pocket of a russian mobster. One roman nevikov. Maybe we shouldn't have this discussion on the phone. The funny part is that right now I'm standing over the bodies of some dead russian wise guys. So... you're thinking it can't be a coincidencE. You're thinking it's all connected, aren't you? Yeah, I am. Well... then I guess you better find out why those men are dead. That is your job, isn't it? Crews! You here? Yeah, I'm here. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly presents</font> -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> These two are all inked up with russian gang tats. This kid is unmarked. These two look like they live pretty hard-- lots of time outside. This kid, pale as the day he was born. Fingerprints are burned off with acid. There are some serious calluses on these hands. These two must have done some heavy labor. This kid's hands... soft as a baby'S. Never did a hard day's work in his life. None of them have I.D. They all ended up executed in a los angeles warehouse. Oh, wait, I got a partial print on this finger. It'S... not much, but let's run it. Crews, is it true your roommate's back in slam for parole violations? Give me your money. My what? Your money. I--I don't have any money. Nah, I can smell money on you. It's somewhere. You want me to look? You know what he means when he says we gonna look for it, right? - Guys, I don't have any money. All right? - Yeah? Hey, hey, get off of me! You wanna fight? Fine. You're gonna win. I've been here before. I know how it ends. I know what I look like when it's over. So come on... let's get it over with. Come on. Are you ted earley? Yeah, that's right. Charlie crews says don't worry. Partial print on the index finger matched to the interpol database. This guy was pyotr lavrov. We're pretty sure that makes this other one his brother dmitri. The brothers lavrov were low-level moscow wise guys. Enforcement, collections, protection. No record of them entering this country. But they're here, and they're dead. And the third guy? We got nothing on hiM. He could be russian, american, or anything in between. But this kid was soft. This kid did not do enforcement, collections, protection. So who is he? Some rich russian kid and his bodyguards? Or a kidnapping gone wrong? Crews? These two... No one's gonna know if they're gone. But this one here... someone might be missing him. you were the responding officer when that russian girl was killed last year? Never seen anything like it. Thrown out of window. And the lapd never caught who did it? lapd caught him. Detectives crews and reese brought him in. - But it's still an open case? - No... we caught him. Roman nevikov... threw that girl out of a window. And lapd proved that? We had a witness who saw roman throw her out the window. Just so you know, before we rescued him, that witness... roman had that witness in a dog cage. A dog cage. okay. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Looks like we got something. Missing persons report filed last week. The missing person match our dead man? - Yeah. - Let's go. Paul's shot? Who would shoot him? did you ever see him with any of these men? Or did he ever mention the names dmitri or pyotr lavrov? No. They're russian? They were russians, yes. "Were." No, he never mentioned them. But when he was on the phone, he'd speak russian. When he was with me, he'd speak english. You don't know paul's last name? He told me once. I--I couldn't pronounce it. Where did you meet him? Here. I was doing my math work on break. I'm in community college. He saw that i was struggling, so he offered to help. Did he help? Paul has this mind, it'S... was always going. When he was waiting for me to work a problem, he couldn't sit still. He was working some problem too. Did he take money from you? No. Did you ever feel like paul might be dangerous or feel threatened? No! This is paul, but those questions of yours, they're not about paul. Paul was sweet. Paul was kind. Liza, do you know where he lived? He wouldn't tell me. I--I thought he was ashamed to show me. Did he say what his job was? Construction.But--but-- what kind of construction could he do with hands as soft as his? Is that russian on there? Did paul give it to you? After we'd been together. He said it was like his good luck charm. But... that I was his good luck charm now, so he didn't need it anymore. May we take it with us? We'll bring it back. This is the engineering prize from moscow polytechnic institute. - Pavel... - or, as we say here, paul. Rozhdestvensky won the engineering prize three years in a row. So he's not a mobster. He's some kind of engineering genius. Okay, what else do we know about pavel? Until a few months ago, lived in moscow, worked at the university. What happened a few months ago? He quit his job. Is there any record of pavel in the country legally? According to immigration, he was never even here. What did liza say paul did? Construction... but his hands were too soft to be a builder. What did pyotr and dmitri do over there? Enforcers, collection, protection. Read a little deeper. Enforcement, collections, protection. Mostly in the construction rackets. They worked in construction. They worked in construction. So we got one dead engineer and two dead builders. They were building something. What were they building? And why did it get 'em killed? What were they building? And why did it get 'em killed? There was a man. - Where? - I thought it was ted, but it wasn'T. Did he have a gun? He was holding something. He went down the hall. Go back into your room. Go. Lock the door and don't come out. Oh, charlie... please don't die. I won'T. You shot me? You shot me! Stay there. Who is that? - You broke into my house! - You shot me! - What the hell were you doing? - You shot me! I asked you a question. I was bringing you this! Tube was her idea. Couldn't just be an envelope, no. I didn't expect to find some girl screaming. I was trying to get out of here, but this house, it's like a damn maze! What's a man need with all these hallways, anyway? I couldn't find the damn door! Do you know him? Yeah. He's my father. You shot your father? I didn't know it was him when I shot him. He's, um, the... the intruder seems to have gained access by breaking the window on the... kitchen door. You shot your own father? He couldn't return the rsvp. Been mailing him these invites for almost a year now. He got all this money-- what, he can't afford to buy himself a stamp? Where's your fiancee? In austin, visiting her parents. Who, as it turns out, she does not feel the need to shoot at! Rachel... can you... I'll go with him. Nah, I don't need a babysitter. I'll go with him. Oh, uh, this is rachel. She's a friend of the family. She's been staying with me for a while. She's a friend of the family. This is dani reese, my partner. Dani reese? Have we met? You look familiar. No... I don't think so. I'll call when he's checked in. Thank you. You're on administrative leave, so... I'll be needing your weapon. Looks like he broke in and you were well within your rights, but... he's your father, so... the department will be curious. Reese, find out what those three russians were building. - Big house. - Yeah, oh! Yeah, that's right. You've never been here before. Uh, it's big, I-I guess. Well... I'm gonna get back to those russian killings. And you can't come.You know, because you just-- - shot my father. - Yep. Yep. Yeah. - Three dead russians, no I.D. - You're on administrative leave. No legal record of entry. They were smuggled in-- an engineer and two builders. I'm going now. Uniforms showed the photos to everyone. No one knew him. Liza knew pavel. Good-bye, crews. No, liza knew paul. Liza did not know pavel. But we know a russian, don't we, reese? What makes you think that russian's gonna wanna talk to us? We'll ask him nicely. Cops. You don't even have a gun. I had it taken away. He shot his father. I didn't know it was him when I shot him. Still pretty messed up, I guess. Anyway, if I need a gun, I can just take yours. Last time we saw roman, he threw a woman out the window. And got away with it. Sorry, detectives. Invitation only. But you... you, I think I find space for. It's your kind of party. Do you want to see? Live video. That is the right now, back there. Do you want to go back there right now? You-- you need invitation. Oh, all I have is this. No... the one I sent out had two women on it. Kissing.Cheap, I know, but-- we thought if one of your countrymen turned up dead, you'd be interested to find out why. Lots of russians in this city. Why me? Because... you're roman. Let me have photo. I ask around. Detective crews, I read in paper you shoot your own father. I bet you thought it was your father crews was going to shoot. What'd he y? Something in russian. Remember enough to get any of it translated? No... it was probably just filth. "Pardon our dust"? You use those signs... when you're building something. Here you go. Two cokes. Were you open during construction? No, we were closed for three weeks. What'd they do to the place? I can't tell. They closed, covered the windows. Three weeks later, we opened back up. Place looks exactly the same. You ask the construction workers? Never saw them. I think they may not have been exactly legal. You know? Guess they went home when they were done. Yeah, I guess so. We'd like you to look at some pictures. I have to go now. Peek-a-boo. I see you. That is super-cool! I gotta get one of those. Where'd you get it? It's after market. What else does it do? Now I must invoke my right to refuse service to anyone. Pavel the engineer worked for roman. Why do you kill your own engineer? Detective crews. You should be more careful with guns in your house. Especially with that girl living there. Someone could get hurt. crews likes people living here? He's got a lot of room. Is it true that girl is staying here now? What girl would that be? Rachel seybolt. Do you think it's strange for rachel seybolt to live with the man she thought killed her family? I think... that charlie and rachel were both wrecked by that crime. When two people go through something, uh... dark like that, uh... I guess it bonds them. Your dad's doing okay. Bullet didn't hit anything serious. But they think he can go home in a couple of days. I know. I called the hospital. But you didn't call him. That's my backpack. It's time for you to go, rachel. I'll explain in the car. All I'm saying, dani, I just want you to be careful of this roman nevikov guy. Don'T... worry about me. All right? I don't want it. I don't need it. Just don't do it. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Besides, I have my partner. You're gonna give him his gun back, right? I guess so. I mean, I have issues, but, uh, to shoot your own father? And he didn't seem too broken up about it when he found out who it was. If I shot my old man, I would never stop crying. Oh, wait until you meet him. Oh, dani, he is gonna love you. Uh, where do you keep your coffee? In the freezer. I think you'll love him too. I mean, if you love me. Oh, and when I say you love me, believe me, I know you've never said it. It's just an expression. A ticket, a passport, and cash. A lot of cash. You call me if you need more. There are numbers in there. You need anything, you call them. I don't want to go. It's too dangerous for you here. I can deal with what happens here. You shouldn't have to deal with what happens here. I know you don't feel like it, but you're just a kid. You sending me away so I can be safe, or you sending me away so you can be alone? I know what people do when they're alone, and it never ends up good. You don't have to drive around with a car full of bullet holes, you know. Yeah, I do. Maybe just for a little while longer. How did we put roman together with those killings? Reese, you're... drunk. Drinking, not drunk. You didn't go there to show him that picture of pavel. You went there... to see the look on his face when he saw it. Reese, how... long you been drinking? Since... I was 12. I meant today. When we saw those three dead russians, you stepped off to make a phone call. That was about roman, wasn't it? I am your superior officer. Now, you will answer my question, detective. That call was about roman. It was information from A... a guy I knew in prison. I wasn't sure, though. That's the last time you don't tell me what's happening when it's happening. You got it? Got it. Reese... you needed to drink to ask me about roman, or. ask me about something else? I am drunk. Where's your bathroom? - Did you sleep? - Yeah. You sober? Yeah, you wanna ask me any more questions? You want me to? See, that was a question. You said, are you gonna ask me-- you been riding the desk since I took this? Except for one trip to the office supply store. Out of gummi bears. You are aware roman nevikov is a federally-protected informant? The feds can't find their ass with both hands. If nevikov killed those three in L.A., Then lapd gets them. I want you back in meetings. 90 meetings in 90 days. 90 in 90. 90 in 90. Copy that. I thought things were going so well. They were. That's when I screw up. I do copy that. Roman nevikov, we have a warrant to search the premises. Just the three of you? The new captain, the ex-con, and the junkie. Four. Okay, that's better. Okay, that's more like it. Come oN. Nothin'. If he was building something, it's not there anymore. Oh, you must be the grown-up. Special agent bodner, F.B.I. Are you all special agents, because if you're all special, then none of you are really special then, right? Trust me... I'm special. Don't know if your detectives told you, but roman nevikov belongs to us. That's funny--I thought we were all on the same side. Yeah, that is funny. This is how you get your friend ted earley out of jail? You shouldn't worry about my friend. What should i worry about? We're here investigating the death of a guy who worked for roman. We think roman killed hiM. I think that would worry anyone who works for roman-- his little habit of killing people who work for him. You don't work for roman, do you? You're making a mistake here. The buddha said each mistake is a rebirth. Don't you wanna get reborn, special agent bodner? I know I wanna get reborn. I have such a small piece of pie. You want some more? I don't think I'm getting seconds. Bring your chow over here. Give him your pie. Anything else look good? That bun looks pretty good. Let mr. Earley have your bun. How long are you in for? Don't you worry. I'm in for three life terms. One for each murder. - You ever miss it? - What? The world. This is the world. That sounds like something charlie crews would say. That's something charlie crews taught me. his real name is pavel? I wish he had told me that. I like that name. Did you ever see him with this man? Or did he ever mention the name roman? No. Liza, you see these two police officers? They're just gonna stay here a while. Just to be safe. Liza, paul said that he worked in construction. Did he ever say what he was building? He didn't like to talk about his job. When he was with me... - he wanted to be with you. - Yeah. What did you and paul do together? He liked america. The people, the energy. He liked to just... go and watch the people. Where would you watch people? This coffee place over on grand. Liza, you-- you work in a coffee store... and you and paul would go to another coffee store downtown? He'd come here and watch. I don't think it was people that pavel the engineer was watching. No... I think pavel the engineer was watching that. You know what that is, right? Yeah. That's gonna be the new federal building. You said the engineer was casing the future home of the federal building. So you called the joint terrorism task force... and they sent him. Did pavel ever take photos of the construction site? Sometimes. With his phone. The workers--did he ever talk to them? Sometimes. Just casually. What did they talk about? Liza, what words did they use? Do you remember? Uh, stress loads. levels. Uh, t-tolerance. Okay, you can go. We'll speak again. When the federal building is done, it'll be completely secure. If you wanna plant something in there... now's the time to do it. So now this does belong to us. So you stay away from roman nevikov. Wouldn't want anyone making a mistake. Having to get... reborn. Did he just threaten us? So... roman brings a team from moscow. Illegally. They case the federal building. They build something in roman's club. Something? You don't think it was a bomb? I don't know what it was. Roman knows. But he's not talking. Because he doesn't have to. Pavel knows why. But he's not talking. Because he's dead. You want to ask the dead guy, don't you, crews? Pavel got killed for it. He wants to tell us. Roman doesn'T. But, crews, he's dead. He'S... I have to go to a meeting. She okay? No, I don't think she is. How's your dad? Resting comfortably. Oh, I, uh, I heard your roommate's in jail. It's been a big couple of days. Detective crews. Roman's a terrorist? Is roman a terrorist? That's what I'm asking you. No, that's what I'm asking you. Who exactly are you? I thought I was the guy you wanted payback from. Isn't that right? Why do you kill the engineer? You said paul was always working something through. Even when you were doing a problem. What were you working on the last time you were together? - I was working on this. - I'm not very good at math. Neither am I. - I like history. - I like history too. You got a date at the top of the page there. Can you show me what you were working on three weeks ago? this. That's not your writing. Oh, no, that's his. He was always working things out. These are from the hall of records. Blueprints of roman's club. How was your meeting? Sober people telling drinking stories. Pavel was studying the federal building, but he was sketching diagrams of roman's club. Why would he sketch roman's club? Why would he sketch roman's club? RUSSIAN HISTORY Why did the engineer have to die? The russian tsars hired engineers to build security in their palaces. Walls, secret tunnels. When the work was done, the engineers knew all the secrets, so... the engineer had to die. The engineers knew when the job was over, they were gonna get the ax. So they built little trap doors. Give themselves a chance. You think pavel built himself a trap door? Well, if he did, he didn't get to it. Reese. All right, thanks. The cop who left with liza didn't report in. A unit went around to check on them and... liza and the cops were gone? No! No guns! Now, put your hands behind your heads. Now... on your knees. Isn't that how it is done? That is how it is done, yes? Maybe... you wish me on my knees too, detective new money? Where is she? You looking for woman, detective reese? Just tell me your type. You know, when the new federal building is done, it'll have more floors underground than over? And all completely secure. He is deaf. She speak no english. pavel was studying how to build belowground in los angeles. He was sketching your club. You building underground there, roman? There something down there? Yo, you searched my club. Go on! Search my club again. I'm just a businessman. Then I have a game to get back to. This controls everything. Pavel build this for you too? Maybe you wanna tell me the password. I heard you sent this girl rachel away. Maybe... I find her. And put my gun in her mouth. Only it won't be my gun, and it won't be her mouth. Pavel the engineer built this for you. And pavel fell in love. Liza was his good luck charm. Liza. Maybe try her full name. Elizabeth. All you have to do is think like pavel. Pavel thought in russian. Which is hard, because I don't know russian. But... I did learn one name. Elizaveta. Am I saying it right? Eliza... veta. The engineer's trapdoor. I say this in english because if anyone finds this, I am hoping it is an american policeman. My name is pavel rozhdestvensky. Me and two others install security system for roman nevikov. We also installed underground vaults. Hidden. It is secure. Something terrible. I put cameras down there. If you are watching this, this is what is going on there right now. Under basement. Hidden underground. He's got people down there. Hidden... underground. ******* get those people out of there right now! you're making big mistake. That's what I keep hearing. Her plane landed an hour ago. So she should be here any minute. Yo castayas long as you want. I would have stayed in the hospital, but they told me I had to leave. Oh, it's okay. You wanna talk about how much you hate me for not letting your mom come visit you when you were in jail? I don't hate you. You won't come to my wedding. How come all you got in your kitchen is fruit? You never ate fruit when you were a kid. I do now. - Can I ask you a question? - Isn't that what you just did? How come your car is full of bullet holes? What does that mean, that you drive a car full of bullet holes? Is that even legal? That'll be olivia. I'll get it. You drunk? I told tidwell I drank because, um-- things were going too well? That's not why you drank, is it? No. I... - I need... - to know something? Okay, don't finish my sentences like I'm one of our suspects. Okay, you finish it. I need you to tell me... what you know about my father. What he's done. You sure? Who is that? It's my partner. Uh, his fiancee. Dani. Still hurts, don't it? You would think here, it wouldn't hurt. But it does. And that's just messed up. crews, you here?
