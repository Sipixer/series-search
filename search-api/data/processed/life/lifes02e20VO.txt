Organized crime task force. Why are you asking me these questions? Is there something i should know about dani--Detective reese? Captain, what would you say If i asked you to gps track her cell? I'd say she was in the care of the FBI Why would i track her cell? P & k firearms, shots fired. Bobby, who are they? They work here. And they're all carrying? Within the confines of the building, They are well within their rights. - Lawyer and a cop. - That all? Olympics, just the relay. - Who's she? - Whitney paxman, ceo of p & k guns. She was carrying a nice sized.45. Empty holster. Was she the one who discharged her weapon? Yes ma'am. So we took it away from her. - Discharged it at...? - At her. - I had something to give her. - Something being a body bag. She should know the end result of her product. She should see what it leads to. Where lisa ended up. Ran by security with it, Was making a dash to the corner office. And she shot at me. - It was a warning shot. - I felt it go by my ear. That's why we call it a warning. - Chairman of the company... - And a pretty good shot. Lock up ella holden, And give ms. Paxman there her gun back. Well within her rights. No, there is no case number attached to this gps request. I know you have to put something down on the form. Put down "captain's discretion." Yes, i know that's not a number. Well, i know i need a number now. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, a number! Like a case number. Yes, i have a case number. Of course i have a case number. It is 9-8-7-4-9-8-1-7-4. Thank you.

I like smart women working for me. But sadly, she worked for the other side. Why'd you think initiative 38 will never pass? The polling numbers are in our favor four to one. People like your guns that much? People like our jobs that much, detective. P & k firearms produces one of the last products This country actually makes cheaper and better than china. We're going to crush that initiative.And everyone knows it. Ms. Paxman, you should see this. P & k are persons of interest in the killing of lisa amis. - how do you know that? - The police are here right now... Questioning the owner. Was a p & k firearm used in the shooting? Does this have anything to do with initiative 38? Is this personal because she was your boss? Use everything. Leave nothing. If you become mayor, what's your stand on gun control? It's complicated. There are way too many shootings. But the second amendment of the constitution does guarantee certain rights. You been rehearsing that speech? - It shows? - Just a little bit. And that is a lot of fire power just to push a mail cart. Detective crews? That is a lot of fire power. You're not talking about the mail cart. No, i'm talking about sending two shooters to kill lisa amis. Why would you send two shooters to kill a 40-Year-Old unarmed woman? That is a lot of fire power. - He sent two shooters-- - To kill two people. Howard amis went to vegas last minute, He was supposed to be in that house with lisa. He sent two shooters to kill two people. Help me. Please. Mr. Amis? Mr. Amis? Help me. Please. Help me. If...I move,the clock is off. The bomb squad's almost here, howard. It was on the doorstep. I think it's flowers for lisa. I open it up, and there's a clock in here, And it starts ticking. I grabbed the wires, the clock stopped. But now, every time i move, the clock starts ticking again. So i'm not going to move anymore, okay? What's the note say, howard? "Who is the little one now?" The bomb squad's almost here, howard. Okay? Family... Look at me, howard. Where's all your staff? Gone. For the day? No, i let them go. My clients, too. Look at me, howard. Why'd you let them all go? What my wife did-- She believed in it. What i do-- I just do it to do it. But now--Now that she's dead... You don't want to do it anymore? I don't think i can stand much longer. Like, a shark, you know... i got to keep moving. - Okay! - Grab the wires! Okay, grabbing the wires. Okay. How you doing? Pretty good, how about yourself? I'm holding a bomb. i saw that. Bomb squad's here. Okay, why don't you point them on in here. "Who is the little one now?" It seems like i should know what that means, But i don't. I don't. Too bad no one got a picture of you saving me. You could make a whole career on a picture like that. We could stage it again, if you want. You ever get any threats before? In public. To my face. It's the business. But not like this. We need to see your client list. Oh, yes, i-- I don't think it's there. It seems like i should know what that means. But i don't. Howard... Just 'cause you don't want to do what you've been doing, Doesn't mean you can't do something else. You know? Yeah, don't worry. I'm a shark. Gotta keep moving. We're going to leave some uniformed officers here. No prints on the device left at amis' house. - Crude, but clean. - No prints on the note, either. Looks like seever took almost getting blown up personally. Looks like seever did. - Nothing personal,i'd vote for her. - Nothing personal,so would i. I requisitioned them. You just have to know what forms to fill out And who to submit it to. His life, her life. His calendar, her calendar. His enemies, her enemies. His causes, her causes. His money, her money. - Connections? - None. Really? No connections? No connections that would kill one And put a bomb in the other's hand. So i searched every database of every hate group that has ever existed, For that phrase, "who's the little one now?" And came up with nothing. It's personal. "Who's the little one now," is what you say to someone's face. It could be personal. But howard can't remember. You know, holding a live bomb causes a very strong reaction,And... lisa's dead. Well, let's go talk to someone who knew lisa As well as lisa knew lisa. You hand deliver any body bags lately? Get off with a slap on the wrist? What can i do for you? Who is the little one, ella? You think she killed lisa? No, she was a she until you said she was a she. - So, who is she? - Lisa's sister, jackie. When they were little,they called each other Big one and little one. Lisa was the big one, And... Jackie was the little one. Oh, my god! I had totally forgotten about that. Lisa always took care of her. Took care of her? They stopped talking to each other a year ago. Lisa refused to speak of it. I just assumed lisa was tired of caretaking. Big one and little one. That's what that meant. - Jackie... - Was trouble. Bad drugs. Bad men. You didn't mention this before, because? Why would she kill lisa? She's... Just little one. And where's jackie right now? Where she's been for the last year. And where would that be? Just...way the hell out there. Why exactly do the park rangers carry guns? Bears? Jackie, we want to talk to you about your sister. Because you killed her. Jackie, we're the police. Why would we kill her? You killed her and now you've come here to kill me. - Who told you that? - The voice. - What voice is that, jackie? - The voice on my radio. Jackie, we don't want to hurt you. We want to take care of you. Yeah, why should i believe you? Because... You're little one. What did you call me? Little one. I'll write up the report, We wait for jackie to be brought up. I want to write it up. No, i like writing reports. The GPS trace on reese's phone came back negative. So maybe her phone's just off. So i called the fbi. - What did the fbi say? - They said they'd get back to me. - Did they get back to you? - No, they did not. So now you are going to tell me what the hell's going on. This have something to do With your off-The-Book investigations? I will not have that stuff on my floor. I will not allow it to jeopardize dani-- My detectives. I just want to know why reese is not answering her phone. The tech guy told me If her phone is off, but the battery's in, they can track it. But lapd doesn't have the equipment. I might know someone who does. Where--Where you going? Captain? I do not need gps to find out where my detectives are. - Hey, where are you going? - Where he's going. And where's that? I'll know when i get there. - And what should i do? - You should be here. I am here. Okay. Then...there you are. What are you? The bad-Ass agent that doesn't talk? No. No...because you said something? Yep. What can i do for you today? You can start by telling me where my detective is. Detective reese is in the field. Which field would that be? On an operation. Out of contact. She said she was coming back to the force. She changed her mind. Well, i'd like to speak with her. That is not possible right now. I need you to make it possible. You need me to? Because of your professional or personal relationship with detective reese? Boys, just because you have guns Doesn't mean you have to show them. When detective reese checks in, I will let her know you were here. Been in these rooms before, huh? Drugs, larceny... Tell me about that voice, jackie. It's not that kind of voice. It's not like a voice in my head. Someone came on the radio, Said that the people that killed my sister Were coming to kill me. I'm not crazy. - Did you recognize the voice? - No, i didn't. - Anybody else hear it? - No, they didn't. You've been alone for a while. I heard it. I did. Out there for a while. What happened to send you out there? There's something else in your file We need you to look at. Do you know what this is? It's an f.I. Card, that's what cops call it. It's a field interview card. A cop fills it out when he has contact with a civilian. This is your f.I. Card. You were handcuffed. Sat in the back of a squad car. Then you were let go. Then your sister stopped talking to you, And you went into the woods. You do something that your sister got you out of? You're going talk to the cop, jackie, You might as well tell us. I was waiting for a bus, I was talking to some guy, And i got picked up for solicitation. You tell lisa and they let you go? Yeah. But i didn't do it. I was clean.And even when i wasn't, i would never do that. I was waiting for a bus. - You tell that to lisa? - Yeah. She believe you? No, she... She was angry. What did she do? She called up my boyfriend, and she told him i was... She said i was... A whore. Do you know how to shoot, jackie? You know i do. What about explosives? We use them at the park. You want a lawyer? Lisa usually did that for me. Charlie crews wants to hire me? Yes. - To find someone? - Yes. Correct me if i'm mistaken, but he's an lapd detective. Why doesn't he perform this task himself? Charlie says that you have better...equipment. Who does he wish me to locate? You file this f.I. Card? Yeah, solicitation beef. How'd you come by it? Anonymous tip, phone call, Which told me who her sister was. I made the call, cut her loose. That's how we do-- I ain't in trouble? No, you're not in trouble. And she didn't seem like a hooker. Anonymous tip, And a representative's sister gets busted for hooking. Anonymous tip. Somebody was trying to smear lisa amis? Who'd benefit from that? There is going to be sexual tension. Between us. Between all male-Female partners. It's in the documentation. It suggests fantasy... As a way of dealing with it. I'm sorry, what did you say? I was thinking about something else. Detectives. What can i do for you? Why would you smear lisa amis? Why would i smear lisa amis? You were ahead four to one. - Why would you kill lisa amis? - Why would i kill lisa amis? - You were ahead four to one. - Detective, is everything okay? Seever, can i ask you a question? What are we doing in this room? Um, we're going to question whitney paxman. Any why are you saying that? We have a doctor here, Would you like me to call him for you? Why are we here? Family. The two you are. I saw that video in howard amis' office, I started thinking about family. I see the note, little one. We find out about the sister, we go to the sister. She takes a shot at us. Why did those things happen? Who called us to the house? Told us everyone would suspect him? Who was standing there with that bomb Making himself a victim? He ran a campaign on us. Detectives... It's all over the wires.Howard amis is making an announcement. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for being here. All my life, i have believed in nothing. I just wanted to win. But my wife, lisa amis, She believed in what was right. Died believing in what was right. Died for it. And she showed me how weak i was. - Is he about to confess? - ??? - No, no, he's not. - I stand for you in the name of my wife, And all those who have given of themselves for what they believe. I announce myself as a candidate For the united states senate. And in the name of my wife, I pledge my full support for initiative 38. And i start with these guns. Guns bought just an hour ago on the street. Just like the guns that killed my wife lisa. I am starting???these guns. We will take back our streets. - We Did you just see that? - ??? - I see a lot of guns, but i see two in particular. - ??? A nine millimeter and a.22. Two guns. Two guns and one shooter. God bless you. God bless america. So you can find anyone? With a cell phone on or off. As long as the battery's still in. Why, mr. Early, is there someone you wish to be located? Oh, my daughter. Yeah, of course. Anyone else? No. She's in italy, mr. Early. - Who is in italy? - You know whom, olivia. - Alone? - Mm, alone. She called you twice, hung up both times. How do you know this? I know everything. What's that like? Almost always disappointing. There. Detective reese's phone. 15 miles away. Shall we? Uh, maybe we should call charlie. Where's your sense of adventure? Ah, do you want one? I have a spare. That's not true. Lisa loved howard, he loved her. Everyone knows that. I know that. He killed lisa and is running for senate on her death? But you arrested jackie. Because he wanted us to. Everyone thinks jackie did it. Because he wanted us to. But howard was in las vegas. The temperature of the water lisa was in Makes it impossible to determine an exact time of death. He could've shot her before he left, And then called it in. When he got back? Got ahead of the story. It's how you handle the press. - And the bomb? - Sent it to himself. - Thing that looks like another victim. - Got way ahead of the story. What did he do to those two sisters? He tore them apart on purpose. Made jackie the perfect suspect, And then he killed his wife. What did we do to those two sisters? What do you mean "we," ella? I know jackie never did that, did what they said she did. How did you know that? I was the one who called in that tip. I was here when the police called the office. I was the one who said i was lisa, Asked them to let jackie go. So you were the one who called jackie's boyfriend. I was the one who called her a whore. Why would you do that? Howard said we had to... To keep lisa away from jackie. Jackie was going to drag lisa down, And if lisa was going to be a senator, We had to keep her away from jackie. Did howard kill lisa? Do you want to get him, ella? Do you want to help us get him? I need you to go to howard. Tell him that you found a tape that lisa made Before she died. Tell him that she said she was afraid of howard. That she thought he was going to kill her. That if she was killed, it was howard who did it. But that tape doesn't exist. What difference does it make if it exists or not? You just go to howard, tell him you have that tape, Then see what he does. Don't worry. We'll be there too. You think ella can do this? I think ella was born to do this. Ella. What are you doing here? They want me to help them get you. Get me for what? For killing lisa. They gave me this tape. - Who did? - They did. They gave me this tape. - What's on the tape? - It's blank. They just want to see the look on your face. Oh. But i have another tape. Maybe you want to hear that? Maybe i do. As your campaign manager, i think you do. i need you to go to howard. Tell him that you found a tape before lisa died. Tell him that she said she was afraid of howard. That she thought he was going to kill her. That if she was killed, it was howard who did it. But that tape doesn't exist. What difference does it make if it exists or not? You just go to howard, tell him about that tape. This is the problem with the lapd. False accusations, corruption... My wife fought against this, and so will i. In her name... In her name. Why don't you go ahead and play that other tape anyway? - But it's blank. - Eh, just go ahead and play it. my name is lisa amis. I'm afraid of my husband, howard amis. I'm afraid he's trying to kill me. If i'm murdered, it is howard who did it. I hope that i'm wrong. Why would you play that tape? What could they have promised you? Howard... You knew everything that i knew, You're just as guilty as i am. Like you said, mr. Amis, You're her husband. Everyone will think you did it. Well, i know what howard and ella have in common. - Jail time? - Yes, and lots of it. It was you. It was your voice. People always said i sounded just like lisa. You were right. Ella was born to do that. And, um, i would vote for you. - Oh, you don't have to say that. - I know i don't, but i would. I think you'd make a good mayor. I wouldn't want to be mayor. That's why you'd be such a good one. Is that zen? Is it? - I don't see anything. - It's here. They're right here. See£¬Two sets of tire tracks. They dragged someone from one car to the next. And she was alive and kicking. Ah. - Now we need to call charlie. - Yeah. Now we need to call him. Roman. But he's in maximum security. Who the hell are you? I am roman nevikov. - No, you're not. - Yes, i am. You wanted to see me? i am roman nevikov. Charlie, who is that? That's who roman paid to serve his time. Roman's not here? Charlie, where is roman? Charlie... What are you thinking? I'm thinking about what i want and what i need. What do you want? I want a peaceful soul. And what do you need? I need a bigger gun. welcome to www.1000fr.com
