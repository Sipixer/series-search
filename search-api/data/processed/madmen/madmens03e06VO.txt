Daddy, don't. It's 10:30. Why aren't you asleep? - I'm afraid. I know. You're not Thomas Edison. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid of what's going to happen when you turn off the lights. I'm home now. Nothing can hurt you... Except maybe this mess. Pick up your room and I'll get you a night light. Go to sleep. - What did you find out? - Nothing. I bet they're gonna make us work over the holiday. And Cosgrove's late. Can we have everyone's attention, please? This will only take a moment and it will not be repeated. That's not true, mr. Hooker. We've just been informed that there will be a visit from the director and chairman of the board of Putnam, Powell & Lowe, the purpose of which is both friendly and of course to evaluate our performance. The visit will commence tomorrow... That is tuesday... At 10:00 and will continue into the next day. We apologize. We realize we were to be closed - wednesday july 3rd, but... - Come on. They were unaware of the holiday. Now we merely need that everyone continue to operate at the height of their productivity and to make sure that their desks and offices are shipshape and bristol fashion. And by no means should these preparations interfere with our work today. Very good then. Don, may we have a word? Well, isn't this perfect? Well, we'll just move it from lunch to the end of the day. I'm having a cake delivered. - How's that going to look? - A cake for what? Tomorrow is Joan's last day. I told you that. But if we're working on wednesday, wouldn't that be her last day? I don't know why she'd come in. Greg finds out about his residency today or tomorrow... I'm not sure. I think they're going away to celebrate. I'm going to get some money. We should buy her something. Harry and Pete, we will need presentations for wednesday morning on the state of television and, of course, account updates. Just a few minutes each. - On each account? - No, a few minutes for each of you. And Mr. Kinsey, you might want to shave your beard. What?! Who the hell are you people?! That was a joke. There's no need for panic. Just think of this as the same as any major client visit. They're flying across the ocean to have their knobs polished? 4th of july... Subtle. - Get the door, will you? - The british are coming. I assume you know what this is about. I have a theory. I believe they're coming to see you. Why? They've shown a great deal of interest in you. Since you swung around your privates in the boardroom with Duck last year. They study and dissect your work, trying to decipher what is your particular american genius. What do you think it is? The presidency? No, I think it'll be a creative umbrella with a dual position in London and New York. - London? - Bye-bye, Don. How congenial you two are. I hope you can maintain this pretense when they arrive. Excuse me? Kiss and make up before you cost us all something. You're being melo dramatic. Miss Blankenship, please make an appointment at Angelo's for Mr. Sterling and Draper, - the soonest available. - I have my own barber. - That's not necessary. - Enough! Everyone wants Martin & Lewis... Reconcile. Damn it! It's done! John Deere is done. The 110 lawn and garden tractor with snow thrower, transparent vinyl enclosure and a key. Look at him. He just brought in a mastodon. Sorry I'm late. Big accounts move slowly, but the John Deere doesn't. Listen, Mr. Clampett. You might want to get your iron horse out of reception. I will... After everybody sees it. - No, P. L. L. is coming. - When? - Tomorrow morning. - And we have to work wednesday. - We have to give presentations. - You got that one just in time. Yeah, I guess I did. She's in here! I'm resting and your little brother's sleeping. All he does is sleep. What are you doing? I'm bored. - Go bang your head against a wall. - Mom! Only boring people are bored. Can I pet him? Don't wake him. Come over here. Go play. You can sleep all you want, little pig in a blanket. That is quite a shave. I'm thinking about my toes right now. - Go to town. - He's next. - I already had one. - See, that's not true. You think thers something feminine about it? My father was the tallest, handsomest, vainest man in New York, and he got his nails done. He had his fourth coronary behind the wheel and then hit a tree. Windshield severed his arm and he was dead, so they never put it back on. In the casket, he had one hand... - The nails were perfect. I don't believe that story. Okay, so he hit another car and not a tree. It's my company. Why should I be nervous? Because you sold it. So that's it? That's what I did to you? I got you half of a million dollars? I'm really sorry about that. No one said you did anything. You sound like burl ives. Part of the problem with mona is that one day she just started judging people. Never gave a crap before. I'll tell you right now, Don, I don't like being judged. Listen, Roger... I'm okay. I'm okay. We don't need to talk about this anymore. I promise. I was holding out for gratitude, but I'll take that. Thank you. Maybe now you'll have the money and the glory. Call the photographers, type service and vendors and tell them all deliveries should come between 9:30 and 11 so the british can see lots of activity when they arrive. Now. Are you being short with me because you think it'll make parting easier? My mother used to do that. I'm noticing for the first time that the ladies out here are rather plain, present company excluded. We could hire some prostitutes. I know your prime minister enjoys their company. The secretary of war, and you'd do best not to bring that up tomorrow. - I apologize. - I apologize that tomorrow's visit will steal from your spotlight. Perhaps we can reschedule your surprise party till after the holiday? Why did you do that? Do what? Mrs. Harris knows everything. I'm sure she was expecting it. I'm going to go home and make a celebratory dinner for my husband. And when you wake up in the middle of the night and wonder what you forgot, don't call me. That's smooth. I got a shave. - Why? - They ordered me to do it. We have an inspection tomorrow... the british. Well, you look very successful. Hot or cold? Swedish meatballs or chicken salad? Chicken salad. Did you pick up a nightlight? I did, and I read her to sleep. She was still clingy. I don't remember her being that resentful when Bobby was born. I don't know that she resents him. Well, she won't go near him. She won't even go in his room unless I make her. - Why are they visiting? - We don't know. Delayed everybody's vacation plans. He was perfect today. - Who? - Gene. Would you ever want to live in London? I'm serious. Of course. I could get a pram and a real nanny. What do you know? Nothing. Where the hell were you? I told you... I was going for drinks with the docs. You didn't tell me anything. You didn't call me. I called you at work. That's a lie. I just ate dinner for two. Get over here. I know you're drunk. Come sit next to me. So what happened? I didn't get it. What happened? It doesn't say anything except that they made Doug Hutchinson chief resident. And I felt the floor open up under me. So you'll get it next year. You knew it was possible. I ran into Eddinger about a half hour before the letter came. I could tell something was wrong. He wouldn't look me in the eye. I figured he felt bad and that I'd at least find out what the hell happened. But he didn't feel bad. What are you talking about? He loves you. He sat me down in his office, he poured a drink... and he said... He said I had no brains in my fingers. But he wrote you all those nice evaluations. Damn it! Doctors don't write bad things about each other. - So you'll go to another hospital. - Not in New York. If I want to stay in surgery, I can go to... Alabama or something. So what happens? - You're still a doctor, right? - I am. Just not a surgeon, and I will never be a surgeon. - Did they fire you? - I don't want to talk about it, okay? I was hoping you were asleep. I have another year of residency. You're not gonna be able to leave your job. Greg, that's done. Well, get another one. Honey. Listen. You are still a doctor. I married you for your heart, not your hands. They all went out to celebrate. I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it. I couldn't fake it. I've been sitting in the dublin house since 2:00. Go lay down. I'll undress you. Just let me close the light. Mr. Hooker, you neglected to tell me that our guests have arrived. - To what do I owe the pleasure? - This is Mrs. Harris. She was the office manager before me, but she is off to greener pastures. That's a shame. Guy MacKendrick. This is mr. Harold ford - and you recall Saint John Powell. - We've spoken on the phone. I believe that's true. I just wanted to tell you I made a reservation at La Grenouille at 6:00 and got you two tickets to "Oliver." It's a wonderful show. I've heard that... A tragedy with a happy ending. My favorite kind. Thank you, Joan. Shall I give you the threepenny tour? Please let everyone know that they're here. We have you scheduled to meet with Sterling, Cooper and Draper and then with Mr. Pryce. Then a light lunch in the conference roomwith the personnel you requested. Tomorrow, the presentations and client meetings. - Saint John, good to see you again. - Peter Campbell. - Guy MacKendrick. - I know everything about you. You're a very impressive fellow. I wish I could return the compliment. Well, perhaps one day you shall. Good morning, gentlemen. Miss olson, one of our copywriters. I know everything about you. You are a very impressive young woman. Why thank you. I was just writing copy. - As you were. - I hope we chat later. Mr. Draper is waiting for you in Mr. Cooper's office. This way. That is a very handsome man. - Good to see all of you. - It's a pleasure. Don. No worse for wear, I see. What a delightful custom. From the far east I assume? - Japan. - How was your trip? Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Harold Ford and this young man is Guy MacKendrick. Mr. Cooper. - Mr. Sterling, what an honor. - Call me Roger. - And you must be Don Draper. - I am. I can't tell you how exciting it is to finally meet you. That's very flattering. Guy here has done a study of your work and that's quite a compliment. You see, in addition to his inestimable charm, Guy here has degrees from Cambridge university and the London school of economics. Three years at the bank, two years at McCann and his most recent coup... Mercedes benz. - That's very impressive. - I apologize. I didn't realize he was going to recite my entire curriculum vitae. You left out "modest." We're going to debrief Mr. Pryce and the plan is for you to join us for luncheon. In the conference room at 1:00. Sounds like Agatha Christie. Apparently our tour continues. I look forward to... How do you say? Catching up. I as well. Well, that was strange. - Look at that. - The suspense is killing him. Mr. Powell and Mr. Ford are here to see you. - Spectacles. - Right. Send them in. Gentlemen. Greetings, Saint John. Harold, what a pleasure. Please see to it that guy has a space to prepare. - Right away. - Gentlemen. There's coffee and cake. We're very impressed, Lane. Very very impressed indeed. In nine months, you've trimmed every bit of excess, increased billings and we haven't heard a word of complaint. Yes, well, pax romana and all that. Bravo. We've decided to offer you something that we hope you'll view as a reward and a challenge. - Is it in the box? - In a manner of speaking. Open it. What is that? It looks like a snake. Fancy that. - Is it real? - It was. It's for our snake charmer. We're sending you to Bombay. Bombay? What would I do there? Well, hopefully the same thing you accomplished here. Where shall I put this? I guess I needn't find a spot for it if I'm simply moving again. Don't pout. One of your greatest qualities is you always do as you're told. No, it's just the logistics... My wife just settled, my son just accepted to school and now we're moving on. Nonsense. You're moving up. That's the spirit. So without further ado, I will give the floor to Guy MacKendrick. Let me begin by offering my warmest wishes and admiration for Lane Pryce and his exemplary work. It'll be hard to lose him, but there's no doubt that our loss is india's gain. Now let me say there's no cause for anxiety. There will be no further reductions in the ranks. Yes, that's good news if I might, I'd like to walk you through this slight reorganization. As before, P. P. L. London will be the head of this body and Sterling Cooper, now more than ever, our american presence; our business maturity with your creative edge. A triumvirate of Don, myself and Mr. Cooper, our chairman emeritus, will oversee three streamlined departments: creative art and copy, account management... That's Mr. Cosgrove and Mr. Campbell for the present... And a combined television media department headed by Mr. Crane. Mr. Sterling's not on that chart at all. That's true. Well, that was an oversight. As you can see, nothing much has really changed. Frankly, my presence here is just to ensure thorough communication, that we help each other on both sides of the pond whether it be a sharing of creative genius, media savvy, or the unbridled acquisition of new business. I'm sure you all have 1,000 questions. But for the time being I say we inform the troops so that the transition can begin immediately after the holiday. Shall I have mr. Hooker prepare a memo? No. Nonsense. This is not to be the kind of place where such news is delivered that way. Shall we? Gosh, we're really going to miss you. - What the hell just happened? - They reorganized us and you're the only one in this room who got a promotion. - Really? - Yes, really. I apologize for my wild imagination. See? It's clean. That's not what I want to talk to you about. What's this? It's for you. "For my new big sister, the best in the world." And my goodness, it's from baby Gene. Look. Baby Gene can't write. Babies get fairies to do things. You know that. It's really from him. I'm not kidding. I think you should open it. - What is it? - It's a Barbie. I think he wants you to know that he wants to be your friend. And you are very important to me too. I'm sure you all have 1,000 questions, but before I raise a glass to Sterling Cooper's future, I should like to recognize its past, most recently, the inspired stewardship - of Lane Pryce. - Hear hear! I'm also aware of a rather significant milestone. Mrs. Harris, from those who have known you only hours to those who have cherished your nearly 10 years of service, I wish you caviar, and children and all that is good in your new life. Oh, there there. That wasn't my intention. Mrs. Harris, please. We'll have our presentations tomorrow. Let this afternoon be a fete worthy of Joan. Enjoy the liquor and delicatessen. Thank you. Thank you all. This is completely unnecessary. You'll be sorely missed. We got you the cake. So what now? They keep adding people above us. One more promotion and we're going to be answering phones. We should go say hi. This is good champagne. I don't think so. I'm going to get something to eat. Mr. Draper, Conrad Hilton's office is on the line. - What? - Conrad Hilton, the hotel owner. I know what he does. Why is he calling? I don't know. - And he's calling for me? - Yes. Well, his office is. Put him through. Donald Draper. Mr. Draper, this is Miss Wakeman. Mr. Hilton has expressed a desire to meet with you.</i> - May I ask what this is regarding? - <i>I just set his schedule.</i> When are you available? - How about right now? - <i>"Right now."</i> Please hold. How far are you from the Waldorf Astoria?</i> 15 minutes. It's the presidential suite. I'm on my way. - Where's Miss Blankenship? - She's down there saluting union jack. What is that? Chocolate pudding. I wasn't even on the chart. - My name's on the wall out there. - You want some? I like to think, "I'm rich. They can't hurt me." That's a mistake. I'm being punished for making my job look easy. Although... That kid Guy, he has a spark. He is a pure account man. And what is that job all about? I don't know. It's about listening to people and never saying what's really on your mind. No. It's about letting things go so you can get what you want. Have a nice holiday. Enjoy the fireworks. We took their money. We have to do what they say. My dad keeps talking about Vietnam. Like he wants me to get drafted. First of all, they're hardly drafting anybody. Second of all, you're too old. Third of all, I have a friend in the army, and if you're smart, you're set. He sits behind a desk at fort dix and screws secretaries all day. Does he shoot the peoples? I don't know. I've gotta take a piss. - May I speak with you? - Thank you. I just... I wanted to get you a card or a present. It'd be nice if I gave you a gift for once and you didn't wonder if I wanted something. Knock yourself out. I don't want you to think I never listen to you. It's just... We can't all be you. Be that as it may, I do take some credit for your success here. Hey, put that back. I'm going home! I can't believe I'm going to Miss this! I'm really happy that you got what you wanted. I remember on my first day you said that could happen to me if I played my cards right. Are you getting sentimental? Oh my God. Don't worry. I'm sure we'll see each other all the time. If we don't, I just have to say... For the love of christ! Oh my God. - My foot! - Call an ambulance! - Holy crap! Jesus! There's a tourniquet in the first aid kit. You're gonna be okay. Dear God. I can't feel a thing. Oh, God! What did I do?! Get her out of here! The ambulance is on its way. - I'm Donald Draper. - We've met before. - We have, haven't we? - Yellow rock country club. We had a drink. Of course. You fixed it for me. Let me return the favor. I can't believe you're Conrad Hilton. Food? Best kitchen in the world... Got a salad named after it. I'm fine. - I really should have known that. - I don't know. Now, uh... After this comes out next week... Well, they don't do that for everyone. I think I look like an arab. How did you find me? I called around, told people I had a long chat with a handsome fella from Sterling Cooper and your name never came up. Apparently you don't have long chats with people. Well, here I am. What can I do for you? What do you think? I think you wouldn't be in the presidential suite right now if you worked for free. Don, this is friendly. Connie, this is my profession. What do you want me to do? I want you to give me one for free. I don't think anybody wants to think about a mouse in a hotel. That was my idea. You got something better? I might. So... What do you want? I'm not gonna lie... I'd love a chance at your business. But the next time somebody like me asks you a question like that, you need to think bigger. There are snakes that go months without eating and then they finally catch something, but they're so hungry that they suffocate while they're eating. One opportunity at a time. Sorry to interrupt. Mr. Draper, you have an emergency call. Home or office? Do you understand what's happened here? That we're not to be trusted? She's an idiot. I didn't know she couldn't drive. You took the machine out. You have to have respect for that equipment. It's very safe when operated correctly. We had the world handed to us on a plate, and then you swing in on a chandelier, drop your pants and crapon it. Jesus, it's like Iwo Jima out there. We should put a rubber mat down so Cooper can get around. They're changing the carpeting. Any news? He might lose his foot. Right when he got it in the door. Oh God. Sit down, Sissy Mary. You're pale. I take full responsibility. Believe me, somewhere in this business, this has happened before. Joan... my God. I know. It's ruined. How is he? I didn't expect you to come over. I just thought you should know. Honestly, when I called you, I thought he might die. But he's not going to? No. He's lost the foot. Jesus. That's awful. Lane went to retrieve Powell and Ford from dinner. They've already talked to the doctor. I'll wait. Despite the circus today, I hope you know that you are going to be terribly missed. That's nice to hear, especially from you, Don. I bet he felt great when he woke up this morning. I'm sure you're right. But that's life. One minute you're on top of the world, the next minute some secretary is running you over with a lawn mower. I'm heartbroken. It's a terrible tragedy. One that surely could have been avoided, although, thank you for your quick thinking. - You may have saved his life. - Such as it is. He was a great account man... A prodigy. He could talk a scotsman out of a penny. Now that's all over. I don't know if that's true. The man is missing a foot. How is he going to work? He can't walk. The doctor said he'll never golf again. I'm afraid we have to reevaluate our entire strategy. Lane will remain here indefinitely. We'll close the office tomorrow, obviously. Mrs. Harris, please allow the company to reimburse you for that dress, just as a token of our gratitude. I think Saint John and I should see him if we can. Of course. You should get home to that lucky husband. Can I get you one? Sure. I've been reading a lot of american literature lately. - "Tom sawyer." - That's a good one. I feel like I just went to my own funeral. I didn't like the eulogy. Daddy! I've got you. I've got you. Just breathe. - Get him out, daddy! I don't even know what to say. Daddy. Calm down and tell me what's going on. Grandpa Gene... He's not supposed to be here anymore. - He's not. - He's called Gene, he sleeps in his room, he looks just like him and I bet when he starts talking he's gonna sound just like him too. He's a baby. That's it. I want you to go to sleep. There's no such thing as ghosts. Betts, this has to stop. There's nothing I can do. She's jealous of her little brother. No, she's not jealous. She's scared, and it's all because he has that name. "That name." You've never liked it, you haven't hidden it well and now you're bringing her into this. That's ridiculous. Let's talk about Sally. She's a child. She'll get over it. Now you have to. He was my father and that was his name. It's what people do, Don. It's how they keep the memory alive. He hated me and I hated him. - That's the memory. - That's his name. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to wake him. That's okay, honey. Everything's fine. Come on. Let's get you to sleep. Come over here. You see? It's all right. This is your little brother and he's only a baby.
