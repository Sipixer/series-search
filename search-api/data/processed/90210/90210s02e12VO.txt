- You had sex with Naomi's sister? - She told me she was her neighbor. I'm going to destroy Jen before she destroys me. I just don't know how. I'm not giving up. Not until Naomi knows the truth. How you lied to me that night. You turned me against her! I'm sorry. I never thanked you for your help. You were great. - We're in public. - Don't worry. Nobody saw us. I found this homeless guy. He'd been mowed over by a hit and run driver. Before I fell down the stairs, I was pushed, and I know who did it. We have been dispatched to spread winter cheer. And to tell you all: the Winter Wonderland Dance is near. Winter Wonderland Dance... I better dust off my princess crown. - You don't want to go, I get it. - You do? I used to love going to dances. Getting ready and going with someone that I liked, seeing my friends all dressed up, but whatever, that was another lifetime. We couldn't go even if we wanted to. Since your dad's going to be there. Actually, he's going to be away at a conference. But it's no big deal. Like I said, school dances, another lifetime. I would, however, like to see that princess crown of yours sometime though. I'll be right back. Wait for me. Annie, wait. I need to talk to you. I understand why you haven't returned my calls. I wouldn't return my calls either, if I were you. I made a huge mistake when I accused you of sleeping with Liam. It was my sister. Yeah, I heard. I'm so sorry, Annie. I should have just listened to you. I don't even know why I didn't. Maybe it has to do with my own insecurities or what happened with Ethan. Anyway, it doesn't matter. When I think about what I put you through... Hell. You put me through hell. I can't go to the police. What am I supposed to say? That I think he pushed me right before I fell down the stairs? Tell them you saw black combat boots. So? Half the school wears black combat boots. - But they didn't threaten you. - It's not enough. I might not be able to prove that, but there's gotta be a way to proove that he's a drug dealer. Just the person that I wanted to see. Guys, this is Lila... my star reporter. Your "star reporter's" hit a road block. Kids who do drugs don't exactly want to advertise it in the Blaze. Who cares about the Blaze? I need someone who tell the principal that Jasper dealt to them. The principal. Why didn't you say so? - That should be easy! - I need that proof. And once I get that proof, I can go to the administration and then the authorities. Once I'm done with that dirtbag, he won't even know what hit him! Careful with that pool cue. Right. Sorry. Watch where you're going, freak. Do you kick babies and puppies, too? You cannot pay me enough money to wear a tutu. Or go to a West Bev dance? Actually, I'd think it'd be funny to just go and see what all this hype's about. - Throw pig's blood on the ballerinas... - Come on, Liam. I wouldn't do that. I'll get us a table. I'll be right back. Would you like to sponsor me? I'm doing a 5K run to raise money for breast cancer research. Sure. What's up with the T-shirt? I'm a Ford Warrior in Pink. It's in honor of my mom. All net proceeds go to the cause. You should really get one. Maybe a pink jacket. Really bring out your eyes. I'll think about it. Anything for the cause. That's the spirit. Listen... You going to the Winter Wonderland Dance? Yeah, Naomi and I are gonna stop by for a few hours before we go to St. Barts. So, I'll have to one-up St. Barts if I want you to ditch Naomi and go with me instead? Are you asking me to go with you? Like... on a date? I sure am. I know your idea of a date. You show up with one girl, leave with another. Whatever. Anyway, here is a form in case you want to sponsor me. I was like, "Dude, you are way out of line, douchebag." You said that to Mr. Huang? In my head I did. I should talk to Naomi. See if she's okay. I haven't spoken to her since the races. Right. Sure. I just wanted to check in. Make sure you're okay. Right after everything happened, I wanted to thank you. - It's all right. - Let me finish. That's how I felt right after everything went down. But as I've had more time to think, I've gotten more and more upset. You could have put a stop to this months ago. - Why didn't you tell me at prom night? - I wanted to. I didn't think you'd believe me over Jen. So you kept it to yourself? - You don't understand. - You're right. I don't understand. Peach Pit Team Seison 02 Episode 12 Winter Wonderland I'm okay. When am I going to stop liking him? Just tell Liam how you feel. I can't tell him how I feel. He should have told me the truth. I don't want to be involved with someone like that. Besides, it doesn't matter anyway. I saw him kissing that barefoot surfer chick. - Apparently, he likes the smell of B.O. - They were kissing? - When? - At the races. Whatever! I just need to stay strong and find some St. Barts hottie to take my mind off of everything. How do I look? I'd ease up on the lip gloss a little bit. Be quiet! I look fantastic. All right, let's get out of here. Blue 42, hut-hut! Hike! Go deep! Go deep! That's what I'm talking about, baby! All right, it's a go for Troy Polamalu. - Let's do this. - Polamalu plays defense. - Give your man card back right now. - Whatever, toss the grapes. You gonna ask Ivy to the dance or what? - What are you talking about? - She was throwing around hints like crazy. At least you know if you ask her, she'll say yes. I got shot down yesterday. By who? Angelina Jolie? I asked Silver. To the dance? Sorry. I should have run it by you first. No, it's cool. Seriously. Not that it matters. She made up her mind about me. So? You can get someone to see you in a different light. - How's that? - You asking me for advice on girls? Man card, back in the pocket! What do you think I should do? You have to prove that you're not a player anymore. That you're serious about being with her. Show her your heart. - "Show her your heart?" - You burn his man card or should I? We can totally go topless in St. Barts. Please, don't go topless in St. Barts. Don't worry. I've been tanning my tatas in anticipation. I heard what happened with Jen. - If there's anything you need... - I'll pass. You're not exactly someone I can rely on. I cannot believe I missed the grape-tossing contest, 'cause I'm pretty much the champion. - Of course you are. - I'm being serious. - Here, watch and learn. - You don't wanna go to the dance? Why? Are you asking me? If you don't want to go that's cool. Whatever. Sure, I'll go. I'm just gonna get some books from my car. But you can follow me there, if you'd like. I'm waiting for you to mess up. And when you do, I'll be there. Just like Batman. I know you pushed me down the stairs. I know you suffered a head injury, but I didn't know you were suffering from delusions. - You talked to your doctor about that? - I know you did it. - And I'm going to bring you down. - Let me know how that goes. I need your help. I know who pushed me down the stairs. - Who? - Jasper. My god. I saw him right before I fell. Or I saw his shoes, but it was him. But why would he do that? Cause I told him to stay away from you. The thing is, I can't prove it. What I can prove is that he's a drug dealer. If someone will come forward and say that he dealt to them. - Come forward? - I didn't know if I could ask you cause things have been weird between us, but I've tried everything else. I really wish I could. But I'm still on probation. Can I do it anonymously? I can't go to the administration with an anonymous source. I'm really sorry. I get it. I'll figure something else out. You want me to kick your butt with the blue ball or the orange ball? Seriously? You took me out of school to play mini golf? This used to be our thing. Remember that summer we played mini golf every day? Yeah, I was ten. I wasn't, and I still had a good time. 'Course that might've been because I schooled you... mom-style. Swishin' and swashin' and dishin' it into the hole. - What? - How long are you going to stay mad? Can we just go home? Yes. After I beat you. - Can I talk to you? - Free country. I owe you a huge apology. - I should've told who I slept with. - No kidding. At first, I didn't want to hurt Naomi. Then I was gonna tell her, but her sister threatened me. What's going on? Anyway, I just wanted to apologize, that's all. I'll see you around. Yeah, right. Like an apology is gonna make it better. Whatcha thinking? Nothing, just that... Naomi's sister sounds like a sociopath, that's all. It's crazy. At the end of the day, she's the only reason why we all fought, she is the only reason why none of us are friends. If it was me, I'd keep thinking about the fact that they should've believed you in the first place. That's true. - Sometimes I miss... - What? I don't know... Everything. Whatever you do, I'm here. And by the way, what time should I pick you up for the dance? - What? - If you used to have fun at dances, then I see no reason why we won't have fun together. But dances are not your thing. Making you happy is my thing. I'm sorry I lied to you. I was trying to protect you. It came from a good place, but I was wrong. But you owe me an apology, too. What you said about me not being your real mom, that was incredibly hurtful. I was just mad. It was a low blow. I remember when you first came to live with us, I would watch you sleep at night, wondering if you would ever let me in. You were so quiet and so withdrawn. I didn't know what to say. I went from sharing a room with my grandmother, praying that we'd have enough money to keep the heat on to this big house in the suburbs. I knew it would be a hard adjustment. I don't think I knew how hard. Everything was different. Everything. I woke up one morning surrounded by white people I was supposed to bond with... like that. I never thought I would though. I kept telling myself, "Just hang in there until you're 18, get yourself out of there." I kept telling myself, "Just keep trying and maybe one day he won't look so miserable." You got used to Annie first. She wouldn't leave me alone. Coming in my room telling me how super-duper it was to have a big brother. I would watch you with her laughing and I would be so jealous of my eight-year-old daughter. Sometimes I... I think about my life now, in Beverly Hills, how I got from there to here. It just doesn't make any sense. But one thing I never question... is that you're my mom. Excuse me, everybody. Sorry to interrupt. I just have a little announcement to make. And making it public would be a good way to let a certain someone know I'm serious. I'm done dating. Totally done. Because I met someone very special. Someone I want to commit to. I mean it, Silver. I like you more than I've ever liked anyone. And we're friends which is not the way I've started relationships in the past, clearly. But with you, everything feels different. If you give me a chance, I promise I won't let you down. Will you go to the dance with me? Please? - What? - Teddy, stop. It's not gonna happen. All right, guys, everyone who already has tickets to the left and if you still have to buy them to the right. My right, your left. Unless, of course, you're walking backwards. But, please, don't walk backwards, that would be foolish. I wanted to say I'm sorry that I believed Jen. Oh, man, it's okay. I'm just glad it's over, you know? Thank God, we're rid of her. Thank God. Hey, go, enjoy. All right, see you later. Two tickets please. How you doing, Ade? Fine. - How do you guys know each other? - We have, gym together. Ade here is quite the newcomb player. Are you two dating? We sure are. We will catch you later, Ade. Weird. So, this is, what people do at a dance when they don't have dates? - We can go get some more food. - I don't know, I'm not really hungry. Me neither. She looks beautiful? Yeah, she does. Wish me luck. No phones. You're my date. I just want to confirm our flight 'cause... - Oh, my God! - What? I'm wearing white and I left the pink shell on my cell phone. Please, let me have put the white one in here! - Baby blue, kill me now! - I'd like to. - Oh, thank God! - Amen. Dance with me? Come on, one dance. Between friends. Fine, between friends. You know, I probably shouldn't leave Naomi for too long since she's my date and all. I'm sure she'll survive. Of course. Of course she will. Is it, is it snowing? Oh, my God, yeah. I think it is. - That was awesome. - You're ridiculous. These are actually really cute. How is it... If you can honestly tell me you didn't feel anything, I'll stop trying. You know what? I'm done. Okay, Teddy is officially an ass. Are you okay? What happened? He says he wants a friendly dance. We go out there and he tries to make it all romantic. I mean, okay, so what if I felt something when we kissed? That doesn't change the fact that... You just said you felt something when you kissed. Okay, yeah. So what if I did? What difference does it make? He's still a player. But he seems to really, really care about you. And if you feel the same way, then you have to go for it. Otherwise, the moment could pass. And the guy you like will end up with some she-male who only has one pair of shoes. You want to dance, don't you? No, no, definitely not. Okay, maybe a little bit, but, you know, it will pass. Let's do it. Are you sure? Just one problem. I don't know how. At all? - I've never been to a dance before. - Okay. Well then, I am honored to teach you. All right, so, just put one hand here. And the other hand here. And we just move back and forth. You're doing it. With you, I can do anything. Awful right? I swear, I'd be doing her a favor if I vomited on them. What are you talking about? Vicki Rosen's shoes. Isn't that what you were looking at? No, I was watching Annie dance with a drug dealer. That guy's a drug dealer? - Has anyone told Annie? - Yeah, she won't listen. This is all my fault. I took away all her friends when I sent that naked text around. I made it so that she was completely alone. Of course she would end up with a guy like that. We have to do something. We've tried. Nothing seems to work. We have to try harder! There you are! This is my sister, Savannah. Back from boarding school. - This is Dixon. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. So, what are you doing here? After getting some of the saddest texts I've ever read, I wanted to make sure you were okay. So, come on. Who's this girl that's breaking your heart? So, one is coconut, one is lemon. I forgot which is which. Is everything okay? Look, Liam, just be real with me, okay? Do you still have feelings for Naomi? - What? - Dude, do you? Come on, I'm a big girl. It's not like I'm gonna go cry into my pillow at night if that's what you're worried about. But... But I do deserve to know. Yeah, I do. That's what I thought. So, what the hell are you doing hanging around me? Why don't you just go tell her how you feel? Because she doesn't want anything to do with me. - I'm really sorry. - Like I said, I'm fine. I'm... ... fine. I'll take that. Look, I have no idea how this got in here. I know, I confiscated it earlier from some kids. You know, why don't you take off? You did a good job tonight. - Have a nice break, Mr. Matthews. - You, too. I'm just saying, you are quite the natural dancer. I'm just saying, you're a good liar. I'm gonna go get us some drinks, I'll be right back. I need you to come with me, it's an emergency. - Is everything okay? - No, come on. What's going on? Annie, we're here because we care about you. Annie, Jasper's a really bad guy. - What the hell? - Look, we don't want you to get hurt. What is this? Some kind of misguided intervention? No, we're just worried about you. Annie, this is all my fault. I completely alienated you and I'm so sorry. But you deserve better. - I can't believe this. - He's a drug dealer, Annie. - He's not. - He is. And I'm pretty sure he pushed me down the stairs. What? That is, that's absurd. - No, it's not absurd. - I don't know what you think about him but it's not true. You just have it out for him for some reason. And you've started a rumor. A rumor that the rest of you are choosing to believe. The way that you chose to believe a rumor about me that was not true. Annie, it's not a rumor. I know this guy's a drug dealer. What proof do you have? - We don't have proof, per se. - That's what I thought. I bought drugs from him. What? I've been buying from Jasper for the last month. And I'm willing to come forward. I'm willing to tell the administration that I did it. - Annie, wait. - Look, I just... I need to be alone. So, are you seriously willing to go to administration? He's a really bad guy. And seeing him with Annie made me realize I have to do something. That's really selfless. What if you get suspended, Ade? Well, I hope you don't. Yeah, me either. Maybe when we get back from St. Bart's... We can talk and stuff. I'd really like that. Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah, sure. Guys, have an amazing trip. - Have a good holiday. - Merry Christmas. - What? - Oh, my God. I don't want you to go to the administration. What, why? The important thing is that Annie knows the truth. I'll find some other way to bring Jasper down. But I could just go... If you come forward, you'll be expelled, Ade. Maybe not. I'll explain to them that I'm clean now. I'm willing to take the risk. You might be, but I'm not. Look, despite what happened between us, I still care about you, okay? Okay. Whatcha doing? I came with Naomi and she had to do something. So, called a cab and just waiting for it. Cool. Tense night? Yeah, no kidding. Everything okay? Come on. I mean, we're friends, right? It's Teddy. He's been asking me out. No kidding. Yeah, and... I was actually going to tell him that we should give it a shot. But I saw him with this blonde girl and... You were there, actually. She was... gorgeous and in this red dress. I don't even know why I'm surprised. The guy is a huge player, right? Yeah, he is. But, hey, I mean, at least you realized it before it was too late. Definitely. Still hurts, though. Look, Silver, Teddy's my friend. But, you, you... You deserve way, way better. I mean, come on. You're amazing. Stop. No. You are. And for the life of me, I... Can't remember why I ever let you go. - What's wrong? - There she is. The girl I can't get. Let's just get out of here. What was that? I don't know. That's my ride. We, we should talk. When I get back from St. Barts? Definitely, we should. Hey, you. How was the dance? Oh, it was... interesting. Any way I can get half? You sure can. Thanks. You know, I've got to tell you. I'm so glad we finally got a chance to talk. - I've been thinking about it all day. - Yeah, me, too. And everything that we talked about. I hadn't thought about the adoption in awhile, you know? Yeah, me, neither. And, you know, talking about everything made me realize something. Oh, yeah? What's that? I think it's time for me to see my birth mom. Can I come in? Yeah. Yeah, sure, of course. What's that? Nothing. So... - What's going on? - You tell me. Ivy sent me a text telling me I had to come over here. There was something you wanted to tell me. - She shouldn't have done that. - Well, she did. I'm here and I'm about to take off to St. Barts soon. So what is it that - she thought you wanted to tell me? - I don't know. Why? Is there something you want to tell me? I asked you first. - And I came over here, Liam. - Exactly. What'd you come over for? I don't know. I guess I thought things were going to be different. You would be different. But you know what, you're not. You're private and secretive, just like you always were. That was the whole problem all along. You'll never be able to open up. You can't tell me what's under your stupid tarp. Whatever. I'm done. Wait. I'm building a boat. Why? Things are... Bad at home. They told me at the Wilderness Program to redirect my anger, so... Whenever I get upset, I just come out here. And I build. Why a boat? I used to sail. With my dad before... Before he went away. Naomi, I'm so sorry. I should have told you about Jen. After prom, she came up to me and she told me she was your neighbor. And all the personal stuff that I had told you, she said she overheard you telling your friends about it, - and laughing. - What? Afterwards, when I found out she was your sister, I realized she lied. But by then, it was too late. I didn't want to hurt you. And like you said, I'm private and secretive. But I don't want to be. And if you give me another chance... I won't be. Hey, there you are. I've been looking for you for, like, 45 minutes. Babe, are you okay? You're a drug dealer. - What are you talking about? - Don't... Don't deny it. Ade told me that you sold to her. I know it's true. Okay. It is true. But I, I only sold to people who were going to buy it anyway. - Stop. - Babe, it's all to finance the film. Just stop. - I don't even know who you are. - That is not true. You know me, Annie, and I know you. Come on. You pushed Navid down the stairs, too, didn't you? - No... - No more lies. Okay, please. Just no more lies. I didn't push him down the stairs. I pushed him, then he fell. - Look, Annie. - No, don't. Stay away from me. - You don't mean that. - Yeah, I do. Why? Because I've made some mistakes? You've made mistakes, but I don't judge you. What are you talking about? I accidentally pushed Navid
