He said if I wanted back on the Blaze I had to sleep with him. - There's going to be a hearing. - I don't want a hearing. You go in there, you tell the truth, and everything's going to be fine. I saw you at a cafe with a handsome man. That kiss was a mistake. I'm going to tell Harry everything the minute he gets home. - Are you sure that's a good idea? - I wish I could bet on the Lakers. - They're about to go on a roll. - Someone's got the gambling bug. Why are you doing this? Nothing happened. - Why are you ruining my life? - Nothing happened. - I lied. Where are you going? - Back to my mom's. But you said that was the last place in the world you want to be. I definitely don't want to be here. I'm gonna have to talk to the school board to determine your punishment. But trust me, there will be severe consequences. How's it going? - Sticky. - Grab this. I have some graffiti I'd like you to paint over. Kids can be cruel. She's a beauty. Don't know how the hell you built her all by yourself, though. Lot of hours. Guess I would come out here to work when I got upset or pissed or whatever... Looks like it hasn't been the best year for you. You could say that. It's all gonna turn around. Always does. Two weeks ago I was sharing a cell with nine finger Nick, and now I'm in CA getting ready to go sailing with my kid. You should've never been sent away. You were framed. I know, but what's done is done. Besides I'm here now. For good. - You're staying in L.A.? - Hell, yeah. I'm thinking about opening up a tackle shop down by the marina. Could be pretty nice. Just need a little seed money, is all. And then I can start looking for a place for you and me to live nearby. Really? I'm not gonna let you stay here with that bastard of stepdad? Come on. Not an option. I'm here for the future zoologists of America meeting. What's the only mammal that can survive its entire life without drinking water? - It's the rule. - I'm your girlfriend. Fine. Kangaroo rat. Happy? See, was that so hard? All right! Ladies and gentlemen, our dealer is here. - That's everybody? - Everyone on the evite. - You sent out an evite?! - Chill. Kidding. Hilarious. Everybody ready? Who's that? - No idea. - Go find out. - Why me? - 'Cause you wanted to be the door guy. Go ahead. Who is it? Kangaroo rat. Let me in. So this is it. West Bev's very own little underground speakeasy. Nice job. I didn't know you had it in you to organize something like this. - What are you doing here, Mark? - I want in. You're not invited. Maybe this will change your mind. Wait, you're not scared you're gonna lose, are you? Have a seat. It'd be a pleasure to take your money. - Deb, you pick up the dry cleaning? - I'm fine. Day was good, thanks. I didn't pick up the dry cleaning. I understand. Obviously, you were very busy. - What's going on? - I jusy expected my dry cleaning. I'm not talking about the dry cleaning. What's going on with us? All this bitterness. All this sniping. We should go to counseling. What? We don't need to go to counseling. That's for people that have problems. - We have problems. - No, we have issues. Issues that any couple is gonna have after 20 years of marriage. - We don't. - We do. I kissed another man. That didn't come out right. He kissed me, actually. It was my yoga teacher. And it didn't mean anything. When did this happen? Two months ago. Two months ago. And you didn't say anything? And that's the third queen. Looks like it's just you two. All in. Call or fold? All right, I'll match that. And... I will raise you. $6,175. I don't have that here, but, will you give me a marker? I'm good for it. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure, trust me. - Will you give me the marker? - That is not a problem. I would be glad to take your money in whatever form you'd like to give it. All right. Show your cards, boys. Full house. - Nice. - Nice! Full house. Nice hand. Thank you. Unless... Wait... Do four queens beat a full house? I don't know, I'm asking you guys. Does that...? Does it...? Don't worry about getting the money to me right away. As long as you have it to me by the end of the day tomorrow, I won't have to have the guys on the baseball team break your legs. Peach pit team Season 02 episode 19 Multiple Choices This seat is saved. - For who? - My boyfriend. Have you seen him? Blond, blue eyes, chiseled jaw. Muscles everywhere, even in his ears. Sounds like a pretty good-looking dude. You're way more my type. What's up? You've been all AWOL lately. I got a big tournament coming up. I'm on the court before and after school. Good thing I took notes during SAT prep course. You wanna come over tonight? Go over some strategies? I've got conditioning. This is exigent. The Sats are in two days. It means urgent or pressing. See, this is why you need to study. I'll be fine. Come on, Sats are important. You gotta think about college. College isn't for everyone. What? I'm not planning on going, at least not right away, anyway. If I want to play professional tennis, I have to do it now. Sounds to me like you're throwing away your future. It sounds to me like you're really judgmental. Tennis is my future, Silver. And if you don't understand that, maybe you don't understand me. We come in from the bay, and then we paddle out to this cave, and out of nowhere, this tortoise comes up to me, tips my kayak... And so, I clobbered the tortoise, and then I ate it. - What was that for? - You're a million miles away right now. I thought you'd be a little bit more excited to go out, since... You were the one who asked me. You're right. I'm sorry. I am excited. Really. There's nowhere I'd rather be than right here with you, right now. Honest. I got to take this. I'm so sorry. - Hey, Mark. - <i>Little Dix,</i> got your message. Really hope you were calling 'cause you got my money. Sort of. I was thinking... I got a pretty dope laptop and some DJ equipment that's fairly new, so... I don't want your old crap. Do you have the money or not? Look... I just need a little more time. You know... I could forget about the money. What? As long as you do me a little favor. It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow, and I want to decorate her locker so she's surprised when she gets to school in the morning. What? You want me to get you streamers? No, smart-ass. I need the key to the school, so I can get in after hours. Your dad's the principal. You can figure out a way to make that happen. If you don't want to help me, that's fine. Just have the six grand in cash for me tomorrow morning. It's no New York pizza, but it's pretty good for L.A. - How did the job search go? - No luck. Surprise... turns out nobody's interested in hiring an ex-con. - You'll find something. - Maybe I should take a page out of your mom's book and marry my own billionaire. You think Oprah would have me? Or maybe your mom's billionaire could fund us. Stick with the Oprah route. Can't ask that guy for a dime. Who said anything about asking? I'm just kidding. This is what happens. You hang around criminals, you end up thinking like one. You got the key? Of course. - Can I have it? - I'm not just going to give it to you. I'm going in with you. Whatever. Suit yourself, man. - What's going on? - I forgot... My girlfriend's birthday is next month. My bad. - Tonight, we're stealing the Sats. - Stealing...? What the hell are you doing? You really are as slow as you look, aren't you? We... are... stealing... The tests aren't even here. The tests are not usually here, but you see, this year, West Bev is a test center, - and rumor is... - They're not here. I heard my dad saying they don't get delivered until the morning of the exam. You can keep searching if you want. You're not going to find anything. Let's go! The tests aren't here. You guys are real idiots. I'm outta here. Dude. What the hell? I'll see you guys later. Good morning, Wilson. Did you guys really do this? That test was going to bring us some serious lettuce. My buddy Jason was pissed. Plus, he's got to get into Stanford. He's not much for studying, so he was double pissed. Come on! That's funny. Have a sense of humor here. Or a trophy. Here... have a trophy. It's not funny. How am I supposed to build an outfit around florescent orange? I don't want to take a class with Mr. Cannon! - What a pervert. - Did you hear that? It's not blowing over. It will, I promise. Just give it some more time. I have a better idea. Get everybody's attention. Fine, I'll do it myself. Excuse me, everyone! I have an announcement I have to make. Mr. Cannon is not a molester. He's not a pervert. I am the pervert. I perverted justice. I perverted morality. I perverted his life. He didn't do anything wrong. And I apologize again for spreading such a vicious lie. And trust me, I get it if you don't ever want to speak to me again. Like I said, I am the pervert here. Pervert! Pervert! Pervert! Come on down from there. You really shouldn't have done that. - You really shouldn't have done that. - I had to. We're proud of you. A little embarrassed to be seen with you right now, but definitely proud. Does that mean you forgive me? - We've all done bad stuff. - Speak for yourself. Of course we forgive you. Clearly, you know what you did was wrong, so... Perverted, actually. I missed you guys so much. Hug! Group hugs! - You wanted to see me? - Take a seat. Dad, I wasn't... - I broke into the school, but... - But what? I didn't do any of the vandalism. That wasn't me. It was your friends. You just went along. They aren't my friends. I had no idea what they were gonna be doing. - I didn't even wanna be here... - Then why were you? - I was just... - Dixon, why were you there? I didn't even mean... I've been gambling. For a while. At first it was sports, then it turned into poker, and, I guess I kind of got a little over my head. 'Cause I lost a lot of money to a kid, and I couldn't pay him back. He asked me to break into the school, and I agreed. Because I had no other choice. I owed him money. So, I stole your key to the school, and I broke in. Turns out that the kid and his friends just wanted to steal the Sats. When they found out that it wasn't here, - they vandalized the school. - They? Who are they? Who are the kids in the masks? I got all day. Mark Driscott, Nat Frazier, Jason Brewer, Steve Peterson. I heard about what you did in the cafeteria. A rather unorthodox approach to repentance, but fundamentally courageous of you. So, thank you. I really am sorry. I never meant for all this to happen. I know, and I appreciate that. Don't be late for class. What? I should've been honest a long time ago, but I would like to be honest now. Novel idea. Fine, I deserve that. Good thing our project's graded on a curve? Cause I'm pretty sure the tall kid with the fauxhawk can't even read. The reason I didn't tell you about kissing Kai was because I... I felt something for him when he kissed me. Maybe I should just... I can't believe that I'm hearing this. - How could you be so selfish? - Wait a minute this isn't all my fault. I'm not the one that's kissing other people! You're just the one who goes to work flirts with them and then comes home and doesn't talk to me. You're selfish, too. And... - And you're cold. - Cold? I'm cold?! How dare you! How dare I what? State what's been obvious for months? You have been living in your own world. Completely oblivious to everything that I have been feeling. It's like you're not even here. And Kai... Fine... my yoga teacher... was. He was compassionate and understanding, and he listened to me when I spoke. And he wanted to know what I was feeling. I stopped that kiss because it was the right thing to do. Not because I wanted to. Come on, let's get out of here. We need to go to counseling. This sucks. At least your family just started sucking now. Mine's sucked since I was seven. - That's when my parents got divorced. - You were that young? I guess it was good, in a way. Less time to think my parents were great, and more time to realize they're just people. It still sucked, though. It's not fair. You know, none of this is fair. I just, I want to kick something or scream or just, you know, run away or I don't know, I just... Annie, what... What are you doing? I don't know. I don't know! I don't know why I just did that. But I just felt really frustrated - and I had to do something. - That was something. Here. Are you okay? It's cold! - I think it's great! - Yeah, you're crazy. Come here, crazy. How come when I get out of the water, it's so cold? Come here. - Thanks. - Sure. You should be with Naomi. What? I know what she did was messed up, but she did the right thing in the end. And, and she's sorry. And that's gotta count for something. So, you should forgive her. Ace. It's a serve where the tennis ball is not touched by the receiver. I may have added a couple, tennis flashcards to my vocab deck. You love tennis, so... I'm going to learn to love tennis. You were right, I was completely judgmental. The fight was all my fault. Which also happens to be a serve that fails to be placed in the correct area of the court. And this is a huge opportunity, once in a lifetime. You should see where it takes you. - Really? - Really. And I'm gonna be at your big match. I appreciate it, but you don't have to stay. Just knowing you support me is enough. Yeah, but I want to. I don't think you even believe that. You hate sporting events. I don't want you to have to sit through a boring three-hour match out in the sun just for me. Besides, it is more exigent that you use this time to study. Okay, are you sure? Cause I want to be here for you. I'm positive. Game, match, set. You win. You're here. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. It's my fault. I... No, what you did was wrong, but you did the right thing in the end. And... that was brave of you. I should have been there for you. I missed you so much. Believe me, I will never do anything like this again. I love you, Liam. You, too. Surprise! What are you doing here? I thought you weren't coming. I wasn't, and then I changed my mind. I really want to support you. And I brought some sat study cards, in case I get bored. I guess I should go sit in your section. I assume I just follow the cell phone cameras and ogling stares to your father. Is that him over there? Yeah, that's my dad... I don't think it's... Just go do your thing. I'll go sit with him, okay? - Good luck. - Thanks. Silver, Silver, wait! - Hi, I'm Silver. - Hi. You want an autograph? - You have a pen? - I'm Erin Silver. I'm sorry. I'm Teddy's girlfriend. So Teddy has a girlfriend? Yeah, he does. It was really nice to meet you. I just, I realized that I gotta... I gotta go. - So, enjoy the match. - Okay, thank you. So? So, the superintendent called and said she was gonna expel whoever was responsible for the break-in. And I said that there was a glitch on the security tapes, - so we couldn't see who it was. - You did? If you get expelled, it ruins your chances of getting into college. I'm not going to let that happen. No, don't, don't thank me yet. As of now, your life outside of school is over. No going out, no car, no cell phone except for in emergencies. And no more video games. And obviously, you mention this to none of your friends. You got it? Did you tell mom? No, your mom's got a lot going on right now. If she asks why you're not going out, just tell her you're focusing on your schoolwork. I'm really sorry. Yeah, me, too. Me, too. I thought you were better than this. What are you doing here? Actually, this is my house, so I can go wherever I want. I'm actually thinking about turning the carriage house into a gym. Put my elliptical machine over there, the free weights there in that corner - But this is where I work on my boat. - Not anymore. - What are you gonna do punch me again? - You deserve so much worse than that for cheating on my mom. Believe me, it's a matter of time before she leaves you. Then you don't know your mother very well, do you? Cause believe it or not, Colleen and I are closer than ever. And we're very worried about you, son. See, it's not normal for a young man to spend all of his time alone in a shed. That's why, when she goes away to Europe next month, I'm gonna start my renovations. - Mom's going to Europe? - What, she didn't tell you? Yeah, she's going on a spa week in Switzerland. You know, at first she was actually hesitant to leave us here alone. But I promised her that we'd be fine. So it's just gonna be you and me alone, for a week. I can hardly wait. So, how was your day? It was fine. You know, some challenges, but fine. - How was your day? - Good. Funny thing happened. I ran into Cindy at Trader Joe's. Do you remember her from the fundraiser last month? - Yes, how is she? - Good, she looks good. I think she put some highlights in her hair. May I be excused? But we just sat down. You hardly touched your food. I'll take my plate with me. I just have a lot of studying to do for the Sats. - Sure - Okay. Thanks. Look, I'm sorry, but I gotta cancel our plans for tonight. Okay. Why? I'm grounded. You're grounded for what? Nothing. If you're not grounded for anything, then why can't we hang? Look, I... I can't really talk about it right now. Okay? Fine, whatever, Dixon. I'll see you tomorrow at school, okay? - What's up? - So, dinner was pretty awkward. And listen, I think it's because... I'm sorry, I've had a really bad day. Can we not talk about this? Yeah, sure. No problem. Dad, listen, I've been thinking about the tackle shop. Don't worry about it, kid. I'll figure it out. - It's just gonna take some time. - Maybe I can help speed things up. I appreciate the gesture, but it's gonna take a lot more than 30 cents. These are worth a lot more than 30 cts. They're from my stepdad's collection. - Like how much more? - Ten thousand dollars more. I just can't stay here anymore. Use the money to open the tackle shop and get your own place. Then I can get the hell out of here and move in with you. You've reached Liam. Leave a message. Hi, it's me. I mean, it's Annie. Look, I just wanted someone to talk to. My parents are acting like nothing's wrong. And Dixon doesn't want to talk, and... I just really don't wanna be here anymore. I just feel trapped. But anyway, call me? To send your message with normal delivery, press one. To erase, press two. Message erased. - Hey, did you just call me? - Oh, my God, no. I must've pocket dialed you or something. I'm sorry. Okay, cool. - So... - So, I will see you tomorrow at school. Sure, see you at school. May I please get five brain booster smoothies with acai extract and an energy boost? And can you label four of them "Silver," "Adrianna," "Annie" and "Liam"? Anything for you. So, what's all this brain boosting for? - Sats. - You nervous? Actually, I'm not. I'm feeling pretty good about it. Are you now, sweetie? Do close your mouth, Naomi. That's really not a good look for you. So, do you like what I'm doing to the place? - What are you talking about? - Oh, the beach club. It was a wedding present from Olivier. He really is too generous. We decided to give our marriage another go. I forgave him for cheating, and in exchange he told me we could live anywhere in the world. I guess there is no place like home. - You moved here? You're back? - Please. I wasn't going to let you keep me away. I suppose I should let you know, I'm a little upset with you. You turned your back on me. That really wasn't very nice. And you know me, I do tend to hold grudges. Call me karma, babe. And karma is a bitch. Okay, five smoothies ready to go, Ms. Clark. You want a power bar? My mom made me take like six this morning just in case I got hungry during the test. I'm cool, thank you. I just gotta say it kinda feels like you were blowing me off last night. Look, I swear I wasn't. All right? Things at home, they... just aren't great right now. - I really like you, Ivy. - Okay. No, I'm serious. I really, really like you. You have to know that. But, I have to go. I'm so sorry and I'll make it up to you. I promise. - Good luck on the test. - Right. What's up, little Dix? You got my money? - What?! - "What?!" Come on, man. I got the shaft in this deal. No money, no Sats, nothing. Dude, I got you into the school. I held up my part of the bargain. You should be thanking me... you could've been expelled. My dad has tapes of us in the hallway that night. He knows it was you. He could've gone to the superintendent, but he didn't. So I think we're kind of even. Interesting. Why are you smiling? Now I know the principal covered up to save his son. That's gonna come in handy someday. See ya, bud. You haven't returned any of my calls. Take your seats, everyone. So, are we okay? Seriously? No, we're definitely not okay. Go sit down. The test is gonna start. Please be sure to mark your answers clearly on the answer sheet. And be mindful of the time. Every second counts. If you have any questions, raise your hand, and I will come to you.
