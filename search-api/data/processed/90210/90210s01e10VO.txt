I'm gonna have to ask you To take a paid leave of absence. This is my job, harry. What are the students gonna think? Jason broke up with me. My boyfriend from back home. I don't think we can be friends if you're with ethan. I don't want to keep us a secret anymore, Ethan. it's wrong To lie to naomi over and over again. Guys, guys, I heard they met over the summer. Yeah, she's hot. I would definitely hit that. Her? what about him? He's actually cute, in a... Just-walked-off-a-catalogue kind of way. They know? How do they all know? Didn't you get the text blast from george? George? I blocked his number in eighth grade. Look at this. What's up, everybody? Dude, That's nuts. When did this happen? After silver's party. How much did you see? I want details. You dorks can't handle the details. Oh, my god, george, you are so pathetic. Why don't you go back to rehab? All right, People. Let's settle. Everybody take their seats. So, mr. matthews has taken a... Student's virginity? ...leave of absence Till we find a suitable substitute, I am your new teacher. I understand we are working On madame bovary. Anybody want to tell me where we are? Anybody? Has she tried to kill herself yet? Oh, my god, are you serious? what?! Are you serious? Oh, wonderful. what? are you serious?! Thank you! really? Um, when did this become The new principal's office? Annie, thank you for joining us. You want to... Take your seat, so we can get started. Annie. Yeah? You and me have to chat after school. Okay. Okay, then, Madame-- right, it looks like we are on part three. Hi, ladies. Kel! Hey! I thought you were coming back tomorrow. Uh, I took an earlier flight. -How are you? -good. Aren't you supposed to be in class? I have last period study hall. And you're studying...? The... the hallway architecture. Thought it'd be a great art piece. You know, the labyrinthine nature of the high school experience. mm. -So? how was it? How's dylan? here, -hold this for me. Well, dylan is dylan. You know, nothing's changed. Same cheekbones, same sideburns, Same perfectly messy hairdo. Same commitment issues. I'm sorry. yeah. How you doing? Actually, really good. I'm ok with him Being there and me being here. Just gonna leave myself open to all possibilities, you know? Look at you with your advanced self-understanding. I'm impressed. Don't be. I'm still a work in progress. Hey, I saw that harry was teaching ryan's class. Is he out sick or something? Yeah. um, you missed some stuff when you were gone. Mr. matthews, what do you say about the allegations? No comment. Sir, I'd just like to hear your side of the story, sir. Navid, I respect your perseverance, okay, I really do, But I said no comment, and I meant it. Now go back to class before I break your camera. I'm sure that's not the best way to rehabilitate your image, sir. Navid, you want to give me a break? Turn that thing off. Ryan... It isn't true, is it? It's complicated. No, it either is true or it isn't. The guy I knew before I left Wouldn't do something like this. I just want you to tell me the truth. I don't want to believe the rumors. Why are you just running away like this? I don't know what else I can say. Sorry. So dixon tells me you're rockin' the karaoke at your birthday party. I'm so gonna make him sing. Cool. whatever. Yo, what's your deal? Nothing. nothing. I'm just... I'm supposed to meet naomi, so... Chill. She doesn't know anything about you and ethan. You know? how do you know? I saw you guys at my party. oh. Naomi was going to walk in on you and the jock strap, But I distracted her. You're welcome, by the way. Wait, wait, wait, how do you know that she didn't see? Because you're still alive. You got to tell her soon. I mean if she finds out from some random, It ain't gonna be pretty. Yeah. no, and I will. I'm going to tell her right now. Um, naomi, i... I'm a mess. I'm sorry. My parents... My mom filed the divorce papers today. It's official-- I come from a broken home. Um, I'm so sorry. My parents throw in the towel, My relationship with ethan is over. I swear to god, if I get another piece of bad news, I'm going to lose it. I'm going to really lose it. Um, i... Is there anything that I can do at all? I could use the support of my friends right now. Hey, you guys feel like hitting up robertson this afternoon? Well, I actually have to go blog about professor pervert, you know, but... Maybe some other time? Later. How about you, annie? Get our hairs did, Followed by some retail therapy? Um... sure, okay. Thank you. You really are  a good friend. Hey, girly. Poker game at meaghan's house tonight. Are you in? Oh, sounds like fun. I wish I could, but I've got my own games to play. Oh, that's cute In a hannah montana on acid kind of way. So 16, huh? God, you've had an intense year. Oh, it's been a seriously crazy ride. New world, new school, new friends... No boyfriend. yeah. I have to talk to you about... That's a really hard thing. Trust me, I know. I mean, since I broke up with ethan, I've been so lonely. What were you saying? I really don't like this dress. So, did you break up with jason before you left wizard of ox land? No, after I got here. Oh, were you the dumper or the dumpee? It was mutual. I mean, you can't fight geography, right? That's too bad. Sounds like you guys didn't really get a chance To see what would have happened. I mean, maybe you'd still be together if you hadn't moved out here. Maybe. I don't know, part of me felt like The breakup wasn't real, you know? When things end because of distance And not because of some big relationship problem, It's kind of hard to get closure. Be great if you could get closure and maybe see him again. Yeah, I guess. That's the dress. That's the dress you should wear to the birthday you'll never forget. Oh. guess who? Soft hands... Velvet voice... Megan fox? Oh, my god! So... I've been thinking. About? About you and me, And the fact that we are an "us" now. "us"? that is my new favorite word. We should do something together. Like boyfriend-girlfriend stuff. What'd you have in mind? Like lunch? maybe a movie? I was thinking maybe something a little bit more private. Yeah? well, uh... That's... that's really not going to work. Why not? I have a lot of footage to edit, And, uh, it's about mr. matthews. It's, it's  a really, really big story. Oh, well, then I'll help you. That way we can be hanging out together. Well, the only thing is, um... I can't have anybody else around when I'm doing this. I kind of need to focus. Okay, so I should just go, then? I'll call you later, right? Okay, yeah. thanks. have fun. "matthews dips in the kiddie pool"? nice. i think it's my best blog yet. and i love it when my readers quote me back to me. you're just biased against matthews 'cause he dated your sister. well, yeah. it's like, what if ethan rebounded with some 'tween from junior high? what do i care who ethan dates? it's not like he's with... ethan's with annie?! yes, but dixon, i'm the only one that knows. you cannot tell her that you know or she'll think that i told you, you know? and besides, they haven't told naomi yet, and if she hears from somebody else... hey, guys. hey, ethan, so i was thinking... i don't know what you're getting annie for her birthday, but let's make sure she has an amazing day, okay? i don't want to give her a chance to miss jason. uh, why would she? they're broken up. yeah, but it sounds like jason's a really great guy, and they were really close, kind of like you and i, so... yeah, she seems to be doing okay. yeah, that's what i thought until yesterday. what happened yesterday? we were shopping, and she could not stop talking about jason. i guess because the breakup was long-distance, they just didn't get closure. i don't know. i just don't want her to feel alone on her 16th birthday, so let's make it extra special, yeah? cool. yeah, you gave me the facts this morning, but did you really have to fire him? i had no choice. did he admit anything? it doesn't matter what he said. how could it not matter? it's his reputation on the line. kelly, allegations were made. as principal, i had to act on them. you're telling me that you believe that ryan slept with a student? i can't get into this right now, kelly. you have to trust me. uh, is this a bad time? i can come back later. no. kimberly, i was just... leaving hi, kimberly, nice to meet you. please sit down. apparently, i'm not allowed back into any more classes until you sign this. uh, yes, i wanted to talk to you. please sit down. if this is about mr. matthews, i'm fine. everything's fine. an aura of fineness surrounds me. i'm glad to hear that. but, given the situation i have trouble believing that you're really okay. that's your problem, not mine. are you angry at mr. matthews? did he give you a bad grade, maybe fail you on some test? no. were you in a relationship with him? why are you asking me? i had nothing to do with this. maybe you expressed some feelings that he didn't return. sounds like you're speaking from your own experience. i mean, it would be understandable. everybody in your class loves him. he's young, dynamic, not unattractive. okay, i don't want to talk about this anymore. can i go? if i'm late for mr. hunt's class one more time, i'll be in detention for life. come back if you want to talk some more. hello. hello? yoo-hoo, annie! boy, do we have a surprise for you. hey, guys. annie, you will never guess who's here. jason hi, annie. hey. you could crush mint on those abs. happy birthday. jason... in california. right here in our pool. um, what are you doing here?

he's from you? you're from her? no, i'm from kansas, but naomi paid for the shipping labels. your sweet 16 birthday is the most important day of your life, second only to your wedding day, of course. and no girl should spend that day without a man by her side. yeah, but... i-i told her that we weren't together, but when she called, i just couldn't resist a chance to be with you on your big day. well, it's all right, it's very good to see you.well, i'm gonna get going. i know you guys must have a ton to catch up on before dinner. um... dinner? yeah. i figured you would want jason to meet all of your friends, you know, before the big day and everything. you and silver are in, right? i have to call ethan. i think that's about it. i'll take care of everything. don't you worry about a thing. yay! you are so lucky to have made such great friends here. yeah. um... so lucky. adrianna. uh... hi. hello, half of navid's face. is the other half home? uh... it's not a good time. well, then when is? i've called you a couple of times. i've texted you. tried to hook up at school. you've gone all woodward and bernstein 'cause of this whole matthews story. can we talk about this later, please? no, we can't. you've been acting really weird lately. wait. is... is there someone there? yeah. uh... my baby sister iman. adrianna, uh... iman, this is adrianna. hi, sweetie. navid. is this the young lady you told us about? welcome, adrianna. we've heard wonderful things about you. come on in. please, please. dad, no farsi, okay? she's pretty, navid. way too pretty for you. please don't embarrass me. keep your voice down, okay? adrianna, it's so wonderful to meet you! come in, come in. will you join us for dinner? oh, mom, i think adrianna already has plans. yeah. i wouldn't want to impose. oh, nonsense. you have to meet atoosa's family. this is shah-lah and masood. nice to meet you. my cousin alex and my beautiful daughter shar-joon. hello. hi. i'm adrianna. anoosh, his cousin. hi. i'm adrianna. oh, just shoot me now. my brother-in-law iraj and his wife roza. hey. you hanging in there? oh, you know. just, uh... walking roxy. nobody else wants to be around me right now, so... i'd be there if i could. roxy, come here. but i guess i screwed that up for both of us for a while. i really didn't think it was going to turn out like this. i mean, i didn't... i didn't think. maybe i deserve it. no, you don't. in a moment of extreme masochism, i decided to read silver's blog. you want to know the worst part, aside from the grammar? these kids... they think i'm a sleazeball. they really do. you know the truth. that's what matters. i don't know how you do it. how you spend your life letting people think you're something you're not. look, ryan, i know you've risked a lot for me. i swear to you, i'm going to close this case as fast as i can. then everything will be back to normal. i'll be around. do you guys always eat dinner like this? um... no. not usually this small. can i tempt you with some more khoresht? dad, please. she's had enough. no, thanks. i couldn't possibly eat any more. i'm stuffed. but you're so small! you need to put some meat on your bones! thank you. so, navid, why didn't you tell me you play the drums? or the doumbek? right? oh, and he sings, too. what? oh, yes. really? uh-huh. when he was little, he'd sing all day long. please tell me you have pictures. better. we have video. you wouldn't want to see them because they're poorly edited, and you'd be wasting your time. honey, he's right. what are we thinking, talking about movies in front of such a talented actress? we should be asking you for details of your exciting childhood. more importantly, adrianna, how are you doing since leaving rehab? mom. um... it's fine. i know that must have been very difficult for you. uh... i'm great. i'm fine. really. thank you. mom-mom, do you happen to have any dessert? maybe something to tempt ade with? of course, of course. lydia? bring the desserts, please. i'm sorry. it's okay. I will have an iced tea And the japanese pear salad with tiger prawns... And dressing on the side. Always. Those little details. You never seem to forget, do you? I still remember the way ethan takes his coffee. You guys dated? Yeah. for a long time. We managed to stay friends like you and annie. Of course I stayed friends with annie. I mean, it's not just any girl Whose idea of having a good time is sneaking Into a jayhawks game. Hey, just that once. I thought security was going to throw us out on our asses but she managed to sweet-talk the guard into letting us stay By saying that I was a foreign exchange Student that was leaving in the morning. True story. Seems like the silliest moments between couples Are the ones that linger the longest. So, jason, is... Is this your first time To california? yes. but, hopefully, Not the last. I'm actually thinking about going to ucla. You would be in l.a. Yeah. I'm going to check out The campus while I'm here. Just like we talked about. That was a long time ago. Don't you have two more years before college? what's the rush? I thought I told you. I'm a senior. I need to decide soon. Yeah, ucla is almost impossible to get into, though, dude. I mean, you have some Backup schools lined up? Jason is top of the class, all-state football. Ucla is his... Backup school You're smart, handsome and athletic. Distance wouldn't be enough For me to let go of this one. I'm parched. I'm just going to go check on that iced tea. So, more details. How long have you known annie? Since grade school. We lived right around the block from each other. Seems like our lives always seemed to cross. That is so sweet! I got to go to the bathroom Excuse me, please. So, uh, anything new back home? I know. I'm sorry. Naomi planned this whole dinner before I knew anything about it. I thought you weren't even in contact with jason anymore. I haven't been since we broke up. Did you guys actually break up or just take a break? We broke up. cross my heart. I was there. Then why is he considering colleges Based on where you live? Look, we started dating in junior high. Jason probably just assumed That we'd always be together. And maybe because of the fact that we broke up on the phone, He didn't get enough closure. Yeah, so I've heard. did you get enough closure? Ethan, I want to be with you, nobody else. Then I think you should tell him about us. I don't want to hurt him. And he's only here for a couple of days And then he's gone. why make him feel bad? 'cause I want him to know that we're together. And I wanted naomi to know the same thing, But you didn't want to upset her. How is that different? Hey, is everything okay? yeah, Great. Good, well, your iced tea has arrived, So you don't have to really wait here for it anymore. Great. You are becoming one of my All-time favorite customers. Aw, aren't you sweet? You're under arrest For drug possession with the intent to sell. You gotta be kidding me. Come on. after all those times I hooked you up? Just can't trust anyone these days. So do you want to do the ten years I can nail you on right now, Or do you want to vouch for me to your boss? Give me a sit-down and let him know how I'm your newest dealer? Fancy meeting you here. I know. nine bedrooms in the house And I still have to share a bathroom with dixon. Ooh, poor dixon. 'cause as I recall, you were never really good at sharing. Hey, only where french fries are concerned. You know, this isn't how I pictured us On the eve of your 16th birthday, But I'm glad I'm here. It was nice of you to come. Yeah, but weird, too. Yeah, right? yeah. I'm, I'm sorry. does that mean...? No, not at all. Actually, it's exactly what Every ex-boyfriend/houseguest wants to hear. Uh. well, you know, even with all the weirdness, I'm just glad to have Someone to hang out with who doesn't make me feel Like I have to try so hard. What do you mean? Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's just I feel like I need to be so on all the time. I mean, if they saw me Hanging out in plaid pajamas, It'd be, like, "ooh, social suicide." I'd forgotten how much fun You were to be around, annie. You're sweet. You know what? that's a lie. I didn't forget. I tried. Believe me, I tried. But annie, our relationship... it was something special. Yo, jason, Come on! let's go! Hey, come on. I already set the game up. We're battling some dudes from michigan, And they already talking trash. Come on, man. let's do this. Good night. Jason, can I get you anything else? No, ma'am, thank you. You know, when you're at ucla, You should really come by and see us. absolutely. Now, do you need any recommendations? I'd be happy to write you one. Ah! there is the birthday girl! Happy birthday. Thank you. I cannot believe That you are 16 years old. Okay, I am late for a photo shoot. Happy birthday. good-bye, my love. Bye, sweetie. Bye, jason. I got an early meeting as well. happy birthday. Okay. I love you. Jason. love you, too, baby. Nice to see you. good luck on your tour. Thank you. thank you. Uh, what are you gonna do, one of those star homes tours? Campus tour, ucla. If we're living close to each other again, Maybe things might work out A little different for us. Um, jason, Um, I mean, who knows If we'd still be together if I hadn't moved? Maybe, Sure. But we broke up, And I moved on. So we're really over. Yeah. What about the kiss? i... You totally took me by surprise. And I am so sorry If I misled you in any way. Okay. Maybe I'll just go home. No, please, Don't. stay. I mean, the truth is, we were friends for a long time Before we started dating, and I want all my friends at my party tonight. So, come on. you can't deny a girl's birthday wish, right? I'm sorry. I was awkward last night. No, no, no, I'm sorry. my mom had no right To bring up that whole rehab thing. Yeah, she did. your parents paid for it. But it's bad enough that they had to bore you With those stupid stories. It was cute. But how many servings of khoresht Do they expect one person to eat, right? See, this, this is exactly why I didn't want you To meet my family because they can be lame at times. Well, actually, I thought they were lovely. You're just saying that to be nice. No, seriously, I wish my family was that big and close. Yeah? mm-hmm. So, yeah, obviously, I was a little embarrassed when your mom Brought up the whole rehab thing, But the fact that they knew the entire time, And they still treated me Like a member of the family, mm-hmm. That was incredibly cool. So were good. I like you, navid, okay? And the more I know, The more I like. You just have to be honest with me. About everything? Everything. Can you do that? I'm a virgin. What? what?! See, funny, right? I didn't want to disappoint you, okay? 'cause I figured you'd bolt, so, uh... So you've been keeping your distance. Yeah. I wanted, I wanted it to be special. I thought you expected something different, And you are so... I'm not expecting anything. No? No. Except, um, A little less of that, um-- What's your mom's favorite dish? Khoresht. Khore, khore... I can't say it! Back of the throat. khoresht. Khoresht. yeah. Khoresht. khoresht? you got it. Hey, annie. hmm? So, jason seems like a pretty awesome guy. He's clearly still into you. Maybe you guys should give it another shot. Yeah, um, naomi, about that, thank you so much For flying jason in. Hey, let's go out again tonight. It was so much fun last night. We can go to the beach, maybe surfing. Let me get back to you on that. Hey, are you still mad about last night? Define mad. Look, I know the whole having- my-current-boyfriend Go-to-dinner- with-my-ex-boyfriend- When-my-current-boyfriend Isn't-really-a-boyfriend- at-all thing Is, is beyond- the-charts strange, but... No, what's strange is being in a situation That's so complicated That we can't even tell people We're together. does that make you happy? No. Me, either. I've done complicated, annie, I didn't like it. I want things between us to be simple, you know? I want that, too. Great, then let's Clean this whole mess up and tell naomi and jason the truth. Um... What? I just, I just want to wait Until jason gets home to tell him. Why? you don't still have feelings for him... No, no. um, No, but I think He still has them for me. Okay, don't freak out, but Jason kissed me last night. Perfect, yeah. Come on, ethan. it just happened. You know why? ' cause he thinks you're still available. I didn't kiss him back. That was big of you. have fun with jason. I never thought my star detention guest Could be on time for anything. Only when it's important. This is important. You know, you seem like a good kid. Seriously, dude, I don't want to hear it. All I want to do is make some cash. Get a job at starbucks. Look, if you're not sure about me, then just say it. Eric said he'd vouch for me and that you'd hook me up. But if he bailed, Then tell me now 'cause I got clients waiting. You have no idea how long I've waited for this. It takes a special kind of sleazebag To sell drugs to kids. You're under arrest. Hands where we can see them. Thank you. No, no, seriously, thank you, annie. Happy birthday. You're the best. Thank you, thank you, everyone for being here To celebrate my darling Annie's sweet 16. Annie, I know this isn't the ordinary birthday dedication, But you're no ordinary girl. That's why I love you. Oh, my god, she is so amazing. Oh, I know, right? She's totally rocking it. Annie, I told you we should have gone first. Now we're going to get a vocal beat-down by grandma wilson. Let's go find a song. We'll be back. we're gonna go make out. Darling. Karaoke... a surprising smash, kansas. So where's ethan? He must be running late, I guess. You should call him. No. um, don't worry about it. Gee, you'd think he'd be here. Okay, where is ethan, anyway? Um, he might not be coming. We got in a bit of a fight. But it's your birthday. Yeah, I know. I'm gonna go get some air. Don't you have a party inside? I'm not really in the partying mood. Listen, I'm... Really sorry, annie. You were nothing but honest with me about that kiss, And... I was a jerk. I would have gone with jackass, but okay. The truth is, I had no right to get mad at you When I was the one who got us into this whole mess By saying that we should keep naomi in the dark. Yeah, well, you didn't do it alone. I tried to tell her a bunch of times and just totally Chickened out. And I guess I didn't have to hook up with you The minute you were On the rebound. That's true. But I am glad you did. Ethan... There is going to be a cake soon, And on it, there will be 16 candles For me to blow out. And my only wish is to be with you without all these secrets. That's what I want, too. Jason told dixon he's going to leave On the red-eye tonight back to kansas city. So I kind of wanted To tell him the truth before he's gone. And naomi, too. Okay. Oh... happy birthday. Is it the pentapus? So much for the element of surprise. Well, you know what, I'm kind of over surprises, so... Well, then I should probably just tell you That I'm about to kiss you. Jason. Naomi. You have to see this. Come here. Wow. She really has moved on. Annie swore to me that they weren't together. I can't believe she would lie like that. I just... I can't believe... I'm sorry. Hey. Looks like I caught you on your way out... of town. What are, what are you doing here? Harry called me. So you know I'm not the devil. I never thought that. Are you sure? 'cause most people did. So where are you headed? Honestly, I don't know. I'm just going to go to lax and let the fates decide. Ryan, this will all blow over, you know that, right? Your real story will be in the paper. It'll be all over the news. And you can go back to teaching. I just need to get away, you know, take some time And clear my head. You know, get out of town And figure out what I'm doing. But thanks for stopping by. It was good seeing you. Ryan... Maybe when you get back, we can get together. Kimberly, hey. Hey, kelly. I can call you kelly, right? Yeah, of course. Am I interrupting something? No, no. I was just leaving. Have a nice trip. Thanks. How you doing? I'm good. Do you think naomi's up here? Jared saw her go upstairs. Oh, my god. I-i-i can't believe this. How could you do this to me? How could you do it to me is the question, annie. I saw you making out with ethan at school. What? Wait, you-you knew they were together? So, I just figured, Hey, if my good friend annie, who I specifically asked Not to date ethan, Could make out with my ex, What's stopping me from fooling around with hers? Payback's a real bitch, isn't it? An-annie, wait! You pathetic bitch. After this, my mother's going to do her big closing number. I think we should pull the plug on karaoke And get out the cake. Oh, but the kids really seem to be enjoying her. I mean, how bad could it be? I think that it involves pasties. I'll get the birthday girl. okay. I'm sorry, but I saw you and ethan outside kissing, And it just freaked me out a little bit. I mean, you could have told me that you guys were together. Why'd you hide that? I... I didn't want to hurt you. So instead you played naomi's game? The girl that I knew Back in kansas was above that. You don't understand, okay? The rules are different here. But that doesn't mean You have to be. I got to get to the airport. I'm sorry if I ruined your birthday. All right, everybody. Nicely done. Time to sing to the birthday girl. Sweetie, are you okay? You... outside now! Any requests? Just so I am clear, Everything you have done-- the whole shopping trip, Flying jason out here, all of that Was just to set me up to ruin my birthday? Absolutely. But if you want ethan, you can have him. I wanted to see you miserable and I got my wish. That's sick. Oh, don't give me that holier-than-thou routine. You're no innocent here. Okay, I should have told you about ethan. I will grant you that. -I wanted to tell you. -but you didn't, did you?! No, instead you tried to play me for a fool, You backstabbing, duplicitous bitch! Okay, I was trying to spare your feelings! I knew you would be upset, And so I was trying to find the right time. But you didn't even like jason. You just went after him to hurt me. You deserved it. I am so sick And tired of all you people Who won't tell me the truth. First it was my dad and his mistress, And then my mother with her son... None of that was my fault. All I know Is that before you moved here, my life was perfectly fine! No, before I moved here, you were just lying to yourself And getting away with it. You'd rather have people fear you Then be honest with you. You're manipulative and cruel And the only person that you should be blaming For feeling so alone right now is you. That all you got, kansas? Listen to me. Being your friend-- I'm over it. I already beat you to it. Excuse me. sorry to bother you ladies. Who are you? who are you? My name's sean.
