I'm going to have to ask you to take a paid leave of absence. I decided to read Silver's blog. They think I'm a sleazeball, they really do. Any girl would be lucky to have a chance with someone like you. Remember, when you're out there,just look at me. When you're onstage,there's nobody else. I love you. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Just forget it. What I have to say something back Screw you, Dixon! I'm pregnant. You want to have this baby, I'll go with you to Lamaze class. If you don't want to have it I'll take you to the clinic. And if you can't decide, I'll sit with you until you can. It's great to have you back,Ryan. Listen, that seminar up in Berkeley that you wanted to go to next month It took some doing but I got the school board to clear it. Air fare and hotel. I mean, don't book the Biltmore or anything, but you're going. You know what,send someone else. Are you sure That's all you could talk about last fall. I got to be honest with you, Harry. I don't know how much longer I'm going to be teaching. What do you mean I just think I was a little naive when I started here. and reach the kids and that didn't really work out too well, did it I think my Dead Poet Society days are over. I'm just going to do a job and cash a paycheck. You've had a rough couple of months. Let's just see how things go. Ryan... I mean Mr. Matthews. You're back. So it seems. I'm surprised to see you. You didn't call or anything. Was I supposed to No, no.  no. Maybe we could have lunch or something. I don't think that's a great idea. Ah, the theater. You gonna run lights again Uh, I don't know. Well, Silver's stage managing. So it's a yes So that's an I don't know. You guys doing okay* Pretending to be anyway. That's cryptic Hey, why don't you go say hi to Annie. See ya.Later. "Say to great Caesar this: "in deputation I kiss his conquering hand; tell him I am prompt to lay my crown at his feet." That is some fancy talk right there, missy. I know, right So poetic, so eloquent. So... Shakespearean. I'm so glad the new drama teacher chose this play. God, I want to play her so bad. - Who  - Cleopatra. Oh, right, yeah, of course. No, I think you'd be great as her. You do I mean, I'd love to. It's a role I alwaysthought I'd play, eventually. Not necessarily in high school though, but you know, when opportunity knocks... You'd better answer. You know, my grandma was up for the movie role, but she said that Elizabeth Taylor stole her part "that violet-eyed hussy." Okay, good luck, everyone. I should mention that we'll be using lots of strobe effects, so please don't audition if you're epileptic, okay Ms. Casey, I have to tell you, I saw the Equus you directed at the Red Cat. Stop right there You want to brownnose, kiddo, wash my car, okay Wilson, right Yeah. Hi. I watched a video of you in Spring Awakening. You were the understudy, right Pretty damn impressive stepping in like that. Well, the show much go on,right I look forward to your audition. "I am prompt to lay my crown at your feet." Did you see that? She winked at me. Yeah. No, I don't know if there's betting in theater, but I'd say you've got pretty good odds. You know what, you should audition, too. You'd be done before baseball, - and it'd be fun.  - No. Oh, come on. Otherwise we're never going to get to spend time together. I'm going to be rehearsing like every day. I'm not... an actor. Well, there are tons of small parts. No, I shouldn't say that. There are no small parts,only small actors. There are tons of less time-consuming parts, shall we say. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, five minutes onstage in front of people, I start sweating more than I do in an entire lacrosse game. Pretty please. You would make an excellent Egyptian slave boy. Seriously. I'd summon you to my chamber. That's an enticing offer. Enticing. Hey, that looks like a nutritious breakfast. There's nuts.That's a protein. So what's going on Things are crazy. My schedule's totally insane. My commercial agent just called. I got to go in today at 3:00 for some toothpaste commercial. "Because for your teeth,white is right." And tomorrow it's the Antony and Cleopatra audition. And I so want Cleopatra. It's such a dark,tragic role, and I've never done anything like it before. So I'm going to be up all night with Will Shakes studying. Sounds like you're really busy. I know, it's total chaos. I really hope I don't smile during my Cleopatra suicide monologue or kill myself during my toothpaste commercial. I need another coffee. More coffee Are you sure that's a good Idea, Ades Because of the toothpaste commercial Two coffees won't stain my teeth. No, because you're pregnant. Ade, remember Look, have you been to the doctor at least? You said you would go last week. I-I've been busy. Can't you see? I mean, I would have gone today, but the commercial. - Hey, can I get one more?  - Sure. Well, tomorrow? Tomorrow is the school audition. Oh, can you lend me a dollar? You know what, Ade, you really have to deal with this, okay* - There you go.  - Thanks. I got to get off-book. Good to see you back, dude. How was South Korea? It was South Dakota. It was fine. Hey, so, Mr. Matthews, does the cop use her handcuffs in bed? I'm going to need you all to take your seats in alphabetical order. Seriously Seriously. Name cards are on your desks. Sit, now. Mr.Matthews,I think the mountain air pickled your brain because you forgot me. Straight from Saberi to Sondheimer. Ms. Silver, I am transferring you out of this class. Excuse me? I've already filled out the forms. I've discussed it with Principal Wilson. You will be in Mr. Kaplan's English class. He's the worst teacher here. The dude calls Tom Clancy "The Bard." Good luck to you. Mr. Matthews,what is this about? I don't think I can be objective with you as a student given our history. Our history? Yeah, as in you calling me "a child molesting pervert" on your blog and almost costing me my job. Oh, right. Um, my bad. I think it's best if I'm not your teacher-- for both of us. Quiet please. Look, Mr. Matthews... I was actually looking forward to this class-- to your class. It might sound corny, but you're not like the other teachers. Maybe that was my problem. I understand the sub had you reading Heart of Darkness. Did he assign a paper Yeah, a three-page study on the character of our choice. Lame. Sounds fine to me. Please double-space it, and make sure to use standard margins. Ms. Silver, you can go. So thanks for coming in. Oh, thank you. My teeth feel cleaner already. Bye. What are you guys doing here? We need to talk. I don't have time for this. I have to meet my agent in three minutes. Okay, well, then give us three minutes. This is important. You called in the guidance counselor? The frikin' guidance counselor? I had to, Ade. You're pregnant. You think I don't know that? You don't seem like you know it. You certainly don't act like it. Well, why don't I go get some pickles and ice cream. Would that make you happy? Naomi just thought that I would be a good resource for you, and she was right. You need to see a doctor. You have to start taking care of yourself. The coffee, The staying up late, it's all got to go. As a pregnant teenager, you're in a high-risk group For all kinds of problems. If you don't get proper care, you could lose this baby. Right, but you also Have to consider your options, okay? She's 16. Teenagers do this a lot with the right support... Support, right, okay. Ms. Taylor, Ade doesn't have the support. Her dad is gone and her mother is a nightmare. Naomi, shut up. Ade, you deserve to have a future. You deserve to get to to go college And have a career,and have a real family someday. I'm saying you should have an abortion. I'm done. Of course, you should consider all of your options. But in my experience,teens so often rush to abortion Like it's the only option. But she could have this child if she wants to. I mean, if you're not ready to be a mother, Then there's always adoption. So many people desperately want to have kids that can't. Am I to understand that you're encouraging her To continue with this pregnancy? Do you really think--no offense, Ade-- Do you really think she's responsible enough? - Look how she's handled it so...  - You know what? Next time you guys decide to intrude in someone's life, Get your agendas straight first. Okay, this is your choice, not ours. But you have to take control of this of your life Before it takes control of you. "Miss Silver"? Who calls me Miss Silver? Unbelievable, right? Well, um, it sounds to me... I mean, anyone else, anyone else Kicks me out of their class and... I'm proud of it. But Mr.Matthews is... He's, like, the one teacher in this whole school Who isn't some brain-dead zombie jerk. How could he do this to me? Okay. Um... Well, you did kind of harsh on him on "The Vicious Circle." "Professor Pervert"? "Matthews wades in the Kiddie Pool"? "Dips Into the Kiddie Pool." And as far as I knew, he did. I didn't do anything wrong. Still, he has feelings. Yeah, okay. So what? So... Mr. Matthews probably Didn't want to be hurt by what you said, but he was. You know, guys like to play like they're hard, You know, like they don't have any feelings, Or like they don't get hurt by what you say, But they do get hurt. Even when they say something's cool... Maybe it's not. Yeah. And... you're intense. Some things you say have the power To hurt people, you know? Yeah. I think I do. Yeah? You know what I'm gonna do? - You don't have to do anything.  - I do. And I'm going to. I'm gonna win Mr. Matthews back. I'm gonna write the best paper On Heart of Darkness that has ever been written In the history of English papers ever. So... You're gonna do the assignment Even though you're not in the class? Prepare to have your mind blown, Mr. Matthews. Artisan moldings-- ka-ching! Who the hell are you? Oh. Hi. Lucinda Tunick. Tunick Realty. I'm doing the walk-through for the broker pre-tour. I don't understand a single word you just said, so... Naomi. Dad, what are you doing here? Tracy hasn't talked to you? Great. Just great. Lucinda, can you give us a minute, please? Well, nice to see you, too. What's going on? Your mother... Is in Paris, she's getting back in about... No, that's just it-- she's not. She's... not in Paris, - Or she's not coming back? What?  - Kiddo, Your mother's going through kind of a tough time. She thought she found her birth son. He turned out to be a con man-- what a shock. She says she's getting migraines again, She wants a little R&R, So she's laying low in New York. What? For how long? I don't know,all bets are off. And I'm not willing to hold off Selling this house until she gets back, So it's going on the market. Selling the house? I live here! Not anymore. You can come and live at the beach with Gail and me. Oh, wow, that sounds exciting. Go pack your things. Make sure your room's clean for the open house. It's all right. Dad, I have to go back to the house To get my favorite jeans-- I left them. I suppose it would kill you to wear one of the other 43 pairs of jeans that I bought you. Oh, Naomi, I wanted to, uh, Talk to you about something. Right. You're glad I'm here, You're not trying to replace my mom, And you want us to be pals, squawk, squawk, squawk. Actually, no. Last night I got woken up at 3:00 a.m. By, well, it sounded like a blow-dryer. Right, I take showers before bed. If I sleep on wet hair, It's a crap-fiesta in the morning. You know what? I'm good on breakfast. - I'm gonna get my jeans.  - Sit. Naomi, you're in my house now,you'll do as I say. Do you understand? Of course. How about a pancake, Naomi? That sounds fantastic, Gail! Boy, you look exhausted-- were you up all night? Genius doesn't sleep. Well... genius may have dozed off for an hour or two And drooled on her keyboard. Well, I'm glad to see you excited about schoolwork. - Heart of Darkness, right?  - Yeah. But, uh, when I'm done with this, They're gonna have to rename it Heart of Silver. Silver of Darkness. Matthews is gonna Send me a handwritten invitation Pleading with me to come back to his class. - Come back?  - Yeah. Didn't you hear? He transferred me out. Did he say why? Mm, you know Matthews. He's a little bit sensitive. And this bad boy is ready to print. "Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed. And it portends now the fall of Antony." "I must stay his time." To flatter Caesar, Would you mingle eyes with one who ties his points? Ty. Hi, guys. Sounds great.I like the way you enunciate, Ethan. Oh, why, thank you, Ty. I like the way you wear your jeans just one size too small. Now, how many guys could pull that off? Hey, Annie, I noticed we're scheduled to audition With each other this afternoon. Want to get together and...rehearse beforehand? Unless you mind. Oh, of course not. Please, be my guest. Cool. I'm telling you,a little rehearsal, And these parts are ours. It'll be good being in a play with you again. I miss acting with you. Besides, we can hang out And do the whole backstage thing. Yeah. Sure. You sure you don't mind? What, you think I'm jealous of that pretty boy? Please. - You want to do this again?  - Sure. Uh, from the top? Sure. OK To flatter Caesar, Would you mingle eyes with one who ties his points? Not know me yet? Cold-hearted toward me? Nice work. Both of you. Uh, cast list will be up first thing in the morning. Hey, that felt good, right? 'Cause it felt good to me, and she was smiling. I mean, it looked like she was smiling. She was like a Cheshire cat. Um, listen, Ty, uh, I am with Ethan now, And I have to be clear about that. I know you're with Ethan, And I'm cool with it. I mean, I can't pretend I'm not surprised. I just didn't figure you'd end up with a jock. But... I'm cool with it. Well, I'm glad. - I'm glad we're cool.  - Absolutely. And we'll keep everything strictly professional. Okay, Cleopatra? You got it, Antony. We're gonna make West Beverly theater history. We'll be fantastic once you really get a chance to You know, get comfortable with your part. I... What-what does that mean? Well... I mean, Up there you weren't always giving me lots of emotion, Which... made it hard for me to find some of my beats. Don't worry,you're gonna get there. Just try to remember your blocking cues, 'Cause a couple of times you stepped right in front of me. Hey, I got to go. Don't worry. We'll keep it professional. Oh, yes. No worries. What is your problem? Taking out a personal grudge on a student? You're off base. Look, us getting together didn't work out for either of us, okay? But don't punish my sister. You know what? West Beverly High doesn't revolve around Kelly Taylor's love life. You know, Ryan, if anybody should be pissed here, it's me. - Brenda? Really?  - You know what, Kelly? My decision to transfer Silver out had nothing to do with you, okay, or us. Then what? I had a lot of time to think in South Dakota,all right? And you know what I realized? I'm burned out. You're burned out? You're 23. You know, I used to come to work here every day and pour my heart and soul into what I did, you know? I... I went out on a limb. And the limb broke. Okay, everybody thought the worst of me. the students, the teachers. I mean, the students that I thought actually knew me. Silver? e... Did you see what she wrote? She got carried away. She's a kid. They're all kids, Ryan. Yeah, maybe so, but it happened, and, uh... I can't be the kind of teacher I was before. So I'm punching the clock till the end of the year, and then that's it for me. And then what? I don't know. I guess we'll see. But with Silver, it's just, it's better this way. for both of us, all right? In fact, give this back to her. This is not the Ryan Matthews I know. Yeah, well, maybe you don't know me. Maybe I don't want to. But I do know one thing: You're a teacher, a good one. And when a kid busts her ass to write a paper for a class she's not even in, what kind of teacher doesn't read it? Ms. Casey? Hi, I'm Adrianna Tate-Duncan. Oh. I'm a little late, I know. A little? I am so-so-so-so sorry I had a doctor's appointment. Your scene partner came and went. It's done, so... Okay, listen, I... I know the whole play. Every word. Can... Can-can I do the suicide scene for you at least, please? Please? This is not how we do it in New York, honey. Sorry. Give me my robe. Put on my crown. I have immortal longings in me. Now no more the juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip. I trust you won't tell Gail about this I trust you won't tell the other brokers Oh, hey, nix-nix. Pasta? And steamed artichokes. Hey, I thought you might want to ask Silver to join us. Didn't you tell me she's an artichoke fiend? Um, the girl likes artichokes. Well, it'd be nice to have her over for dinner at some point. Or not. Sit. Talk to your mother. What about? Well, what's going on with you and Silver? Are you guys having problems? Not according to her. Well, what about according to you? Well, you know, we kind of got into a fight. Well... first I told her I loved her. You did? But we-we got into a fight after, you know? She just blew up on me. Like, I don't even get it. Well, did you talk about it? Does she know you're upset? We kind of decided not to talk about it, you know? Just sweep it under a rug. How's that going? Just feels like there's something big under the rug. Somebody's gonna break their neck. Mm. You up for some maternal wisdom? Willing to take a risk. I like flowers, right? I mean, big shockeroo, a girl likes flowers. But your dad never ever brought me flowers. I would hint, I would sulk,I would open magazines to photos of flowers, and he would never ever get the clues. Birthdays, Valentine's Day, no flowers. Finally, I came up with something very crafty, very clever. What's that? I said "I want flowers." Oh... People aren't mind readers. Even people who are really close. If you're upset with Silver, you can't just expect her to just know that. You have to tell her and be direct. Hi. Hey, Miss No Cell Phone Service. Feel like I should have sent a pigeon carrier or smoke signals. I'm sorry. I just had to drive. Where to Nowhere. I just drove and drove and drove, trying to figure out what I should do. And? And I was driving up the coast and I kept seeing these people on the beach. They were playing volleyball and flying kites... without a care in the world. And I kept thinking... "Adrianna, you're never gonna be like them again." I have a kid or I have an abortion. Either way... how am I ever gonna fly a kite again? You know what I mean? I mean, it's not like we fly kites, but... Flying kites is always an option. Anyway, I was driving and driving, and then somewhere around Big Sur, I almost got killed. What? What happened? A car accident or this almost accident. My God, are you okay? I pulled over, and suddenly it hit me, you know? Like, I... I have to take control of the situation. I have to make a choice. And I ended up going to this woman's clinic that my hairdresser was talking about. I saw a doctor, and... Did, did you...? I couldn't. I can't. Honey, I understand. Honestly, I don't think I could either. I mean, it's one thing to talk about it, but... I can't. I'm too far along. It's not legal, it's not possible. Abortion just isn't an option. Whether I like it or not, I'm having this baby. Hey, Dad, can you move your car? You blocked me in again. Okay, but park in the street when you get back, will ya? I'm tired of moving my car every half an hour. Um, yeah, actually, I'm not coming back. I reserved a hotel suite. I'm gonna stay there until Mom comes home. No. - Yes. - Naomi, I am your father. There is no option. Yeah technically you're my father, but you haven't been much of a parent, have you? You haven't earned the right to parent me. I mean, there's teenagers straight out of rehab who can't even afford a cup of coffee who'll make better parents than you. You can't talk to me like that. I went by the house yesterday to pick up my jeans around 3:00 p.m. You know, I don't see how that lovely broker of ours is ever gonna sell that house if you keep her tied up with all your pointless busy work. I'm your father. I don't need a father anymore. But thanks. Oh, but I do need you to move your car. You wanted to see me? Read your paper. Oh, yeah? Yep. And? I mean, uh... Did you like it? It's not bad. It was insightful. It's ambitious. I liked knowing that you read the book. I liked knowing that it meant something to you, and I liked reading what you thought. Thanks. Well... Thank you... for... making me want to stay up all night getting carpal tunnel. Glad you liked the book. Yeah. It was pretty kick-ass. You know, you might cut down on some of the enthusiastic colloquial adjectives that you seem to be so fond of-- "kick-ass", "bad-ass"... anything with an "ass" in it, really. Just, you might try finding a synonym next time. Next time? Yeah. So... I'm back in your class? Cool. I'll get a thesaurus. Thanks to everyone who auditioned, and kids, no crying. Please. At least until I'm out of hearing range. Huh. Charmian? It's a pretty good part. You're Cleopatra's favorite servant girl, and you get to die at the end. Wonderful. Just wonderful. Congrats! You got a part, dude. I did? No way. Move. Mardian the Eunuch? All right. You auditioned? Well, I mean, I figured... A little bit of public sweating Probably wouldn't hurt me. Plus, I mean, we get to hang out. We can do the whole... backstage thing. Yeah, yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. Who got Cleopatra? Who else? Adrianna. Whatever you need, whenever you need it, I'm here. You can call, text, knock on my door at 3:00 in the morning. Thank you. I'm, I'm sorry if I was rude before. I just... Can I blame it on hormones? I am a high school guidance counselor. I'm used to abuse. So, first step, She's going to need some medical info. Um... I guess you could be helpful in getting her into some kind of support group, Maybe for teenage moms. Obviously we have to find a good doctor. I want her to have the best OB/GYN in town. That's nice. Only the best for you, baby. Platinum speculum all the way. I'll make some calls. Adrianna, The doctor is gonna want to know Who the father is-- You know, for hereditary health reasons. Okay. Sure. So, you conceived before you went into rehab, Right? Hank isn't the father. Wait. What? Then who? There's only one guy it could be. Guess who? Ty. Hi. Antony to your Cleopatra. Congrats. See you at the dinner. Uh... hon, there's a light right there. I know. Annie? Hey. The door was open. That's a casual look. Uh... You know, I'm really not up For the cast and crew dinner thing. Oh. I thought the whole point of me doing this play Was so we could hang out together. I'm sorry. Come on. It's gonna be fun. An Egyptian restaurant. I don't even really know what Egyptian cuisine entails. Couscous. I'm guessing couscous. You go ahead. You don't mind? Seriously, go. Have fun. You know you're my leading lady, right? Well, well, well,the notorious Brian Matthews. I see my reputation precedes me. Welcome to West Beverly. Thank you. Damon, Congrats on Enobarbus. So, wh-what brings you here? Ah, free food. You know what teachers make. Can't really afford groceries. Thanks for that. Plus, I actually wanted to talk to you. I, uh... I'm thinking of putting Antony and Cleopatra On my syllabus And I thought, you know, maybe you could come to class And talk to the kids from a director's point of view. Interdisciplinary. I like it. Sounds like you're a very passionate teacher. What can I say? You know, you can't reach these kids Unless you're willing to go out On a limb once in a while. Oh. A fellow tree-climber, are you? I'm gonna get some schwarma. - But I'll, I'll see ya. - Yeah. Nice to meet you. Dixon! You're late! What happened? - Uh, Silver. I...  - Doesn't matter. Did you hear? Ryan let me back into his class. Yes, my amazing-paper plan worked. I mean, that's great, but... And he loved it. He wouldn't stop going on about How great the paper was. Cool. I...I think the word "insightful" actually came up once or twice. Insightful. Insightful. And then he actually started telling me... You know, for someone so insightful, You could be pretty dense. Sorry, what? All right. Look. I know you're not a mind reader. Ooh. You're on to me. Can I please just talk For one second without being interrupted? Okay. All right. The fight that we had at the beach. It freaked me out. You know... I know you're intense. And I, I get that. You have big moods and a lot of them. You know? I get that. You're stormy. So? So I want to break up with you. What? I'm breaking up. It's over. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming with me. No problem. I like theater people, you know? Well, in small doses, that is. The second some actor dude Comes up to me, and corners me And starts talking about his "process," I might have to duck back to my hotel. Listen to you. "Duck back to my hotel." I love saying it. It's the most beautiful phrase in the English language. "Duck back to my hotel." But seriously, If you ever need to crash... What's wrong? Ty just walked in. Are you gonna talk to him? Eventually. Hey, honey. Hey. Whatcha doing? Just, uh, sitting here, feeling like an idiot. Well, Can we join you? I mean, for the sitting part. I really thought I was gonna get the part. Annie, you got a part. You have a reason to celebrate tonight. You know, Once in college, I applied for a summer photo Internship at Vogue. I wanted it so much, but... But you didn't get it, and you ended up Working at the local newspaper,which turned out to be The best thing that could have happened. Have I told you that one before? It's an oldie... But a goodie. You know, sweetie, the bottom line is You got beat. No shame, and that happens To even the best teams. Besides, Adrianna's lived here her whole life, She's got the home court advantage. Yeah. Well... thanks, you guys, But I don't know. I feel bummed out that I didn't get the lead, And then I feel bummed out that I'm the kind of person That gets bummed out that they didn't get the lead, And then imagining being at that party tonight And having to pretend like I'm not bummed out... You get bummed out. Yeah. Especially if I'm worrying About not being a good enough actress To hide that I'm bummed out. No. You are an amazing actress, And they will all think you're thrilled to be there. I agree. In fact, I think they'll think You didn't want to be Cleopatra to begin with. Think of it as a challenge. Ugh. Why is life so full of challenges? Because it's life. True. Very true. Eth? I changed my mind. I'm coming. Cool. Um, do you mind coming back and picking me up? All right. Be there in two.
