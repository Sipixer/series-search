I like you more than I've ever liked anyone. This is my sister Savannah, back from boarding school. This is Dixon. - Nice to meet you. - The guy's a huge player. Me and Silver aren't over yet. We're talking about getting back together. I got a text from Ivy saying that you had something you wanted to tell me. I think it's time for me to see my birth mom. I know this guy's a drug dealer. I've been buying from Jasper for the last month. - You're a drug dealer. - You accidentally ran over my uncle. Apparently, they're doing random locker searches, something to do with drugs. Come on. Let's go. This has been a productive afternoon. I'm so sorry. Keep your eyes on the road there, partner. Any word from Navid? No, and if I leave him any more messages, I'm gonna seem stalker-ish. There's no way that that coke was his. We're talking about Navid here. I can't believe got suspended when he's so clearly innocent. - It's a travesty of justice. - At least he wasn't expelled. Or expunged. What's that, death by sponge? Exactly. I bet his parents confiscated his phone and his computer, and he has no idea that I'm trying to reach out to him. - I feel so helpless. - He's gonna be okay. Hey, guys. Looks like you've been doing some serious shopping. One of us has. You should come with us. We have about 20 minutes left before the shops close, and I am still looking for the perfect LGD. Little Gold Dress. Of course. - I would love to... - Come on. Sorry, I can't. So I'll see you later. See you later, Annie. - You hungry? - Not really. Come on, Annie, you said that you would give me a chance. What do you mean? I'm giving you a chance. We're here, aren't we? We're hanging out, what do you want? What I want is to have things how they used to be. I want you to come over to my house, tomorrow night. What do you say? I say I have homework. Come on, we used to always hang out at my house. Damn it! I'm getting really sick and tired of this attitude of yours. We had a deal. And you know what's at stake. I'll go to your house. I've been looking all over for you. We should talk. Yeah, we should. What are you thinking? I want to get back together. Good morning. - Good morning, sweetheart. - Somebody's in a good mood. Are you wearing cologne? - Maybe a splash. - I have to go clear my nose out. What happened, did you win the lottery last night? Not exactly. But I did wake up with a good feeling. Something that I've been worried about is finally gonna work out. Is this about your birth mother? Did she e-mail you back? - No, she didn't. - I'm sorry. It's cool, it's fine. She doesn't want to see me; big deal. She has her own life, right? And you're okay? Me? Yeah, I'm fine. Things are good. And they're gonna get better. You know what? Got to get ready for school. Don't want to be late. Have a good day. - See you, bub. - Peace. I've been looking for you. We should talk. What are you thinking? I really, really care about your friendship. I really, really want us to be friends. Still into Teddy? It's not like it's an either/or thing, Teddy or Dixon. It has nothing to do with Teddy. I don't feel that way about you anymore. Or right now. I'm sorry. - But I really... - Really want to be friends? I'm serious about that. I like having you back in my life, and... I want it to stay that way. It will. How's the burger? It's not bad. - You want a bite? - No, I'm fine. Want a bite of my extremely dry chicken? But I'm sorry it's dry. You want me to run up and get you something else? I was just making a little joke. Apparently, a bad one. It wasn't bad, it was... it was funny. I was actually doing some reading about boats yesterday. Apparently, the earliest boats were built over 40,000 years ago. - They weren't cruise ships... - More like canoes? Exactly. Canoes. Hey, potato head. What the hell! Be prepared to go down! Not gonna happen, sucker! I give up, okay? Mercy. That's what I'm talking about! Later, loser. Bye, Naomi. Sorry about that. What were we talking about? Canoes. Exactly. - What's up? - You're totally over Liam, right? Me? I'm the one that got you guys together, remember? I know. I wanted to double-check, cause I could really use your help. And in exchange, I will give you some fabulous fashion tips. First of all, you should burn that T-shirt. Listen, Naomi, I really got to go. No, please. It's me and Liam. We obviously have incredible sexual chemistry. Good to know. I don't understand why he's so stiff around me. Outside the bedroom. Inside, like I said, he's plenty stiff. Right, like you said. I'm just trying really, really hard, and it seems like he's completely uncomfortable around me. But then I see him with you, and he is so relaxed, throwing French fries... What do you think the problem is? I'm not really sure. It's not like I spend a lot of time with the two of you... You're right. We should all do something together. - Excuse me? - He's clearly more relaxed around you, and maybe it'll rub off on me. Please? I really want this relationship to work out. Let's all do something together. You know what? I know just the thing. Thank you! Come in. My parents are away. We have the whole house to ourselves. I know what's been the problem between us. We haven't been connecting lately, and I think it's because... we haven't been intimate. Intimate? If we have sex, then you'll remember how magical things used to be between us. You'll remember our special connection. Come here. Jasper, no. What do you mean, no? I mean... I can't sleep with you. You have to! You have to... You have to give us a chance. Are you... Are you saying that if I don't have sex with you, you're gonna go to the police? Don't be vulgar, Annie. What I want is what's good for both of us. I just want... us to have a real chance. Peach Pit Team Saison 02 Ã‰pisode 14 <i>Girls fight</i> Jasper, no. I can't. I can't have sex with you, and I can't be in a relationship with you. I just... I can't. And if that means you have to go to the police, then you have to go to the police. You don't mean that. - Yeah, I do. - You don't mean that, Annie. And if you love me, like you claim to, and you want even the slimmest chance of us getting back together, you won't go to the police. 'Cause if you go to the police, that's it. That chance that we might get back together, that one-in- a-million chance, it'll be gone. Naomi, stick around a second. I want to talk to you. Any similarities between my paper and Wikipedia is purely coincidental... It's not that. I was just kidding. So what's up? I'm just checking in. I want to see how you're holding up since Jen. I am okay. Good. I'm glad. I actually have some of her stuff. It's mostly clothes, - it's probably expensive. - Just throw it out. Or better yet, put it up on eBay and buy yourself a new pair of shoes. I just want you to know, if there's anything that you need... I'm fine, Mr. Matthews. Are you all right? She was pretty awful to you, too, using you to bait rich men or whatever. What's that? She told me it looked good to be dating a teacher. That way, rich men wouldn't think that she was after their money. I'm sorry, I didn't realize it'd bother you. She's a sociopath. Yeah, I know. Don't worry, I'm fine. You're going to be late for your next class. You busy? No, I'm just slacking off, 'cause Navid's not here. Great. Sorry. I shouldn't have brought him up. Have you been able to get ahold of him? But in a way, it's actually easier. Not being able to see him or talk to him. It makes my heart hurt less. - Does that make me a horrible person? - No. Trust me, I get it. In history, we're learning about medieval torture techniques. And I got to say sitting next to Alexa for 40 minutes pretty much trumps impalement. When I pass Navid in the hallway, it's like I can't breathe. I saw Alexa getting out of her car on La Brea, and I walked into a lamppost. Shut up. I'm serious. True story. I had a lump and everything. Still didn't hurt as much as my heart. You win. You are most miserable. Sorry. Been awhile since I won anything. Cheers. Here's to being miserable. Being miserable. You are going to die when you see the view from the top of this hike. I'm talking full 360. Right on. Being outdoors reminds me L.A.'s got more to offer than Botox. I know I love the outdoors. All the rocks, dirt. Chance to wear khaki. It's funny, I never thought you'd like hiking. I am full of surprises. - Come on, guys, let's get going. - Let's do it. Sorry this isn't really your thing. I thought getting outside, a little physical activity, help you guys, get out of your heads, whatever. I totally agree. It's already working. He fist-bumped me. What exactly is a seitan burger? It's like a burger, except instead of the burger part, - it has seitan. - I don't know. It sounds to me like you're eating a Satan burger. It is the best thing you can get for six dollars and sixty-six cents. See, this is nice, right? Nice hanging out, being friends. Yeah, it is. So, have you heard back from your birth mother? No, actually. But it's cool, though. I'm kind of used to being rejected. Come on, I'm just joking. Looks like Teddy's still hanging out with that girl from the dance. Can't believe they're actually still seeing each other. This is a long-term relationship for him. You met her at the dance, right? What's she like? I don't know. Wasn't really paying attention. She looks really friendly. Are you almost done with your burger? I can get the check. Check, please? I know I'm way out of line here, but I have to tell you, you're making a huge mistake rejecting a great guy like my brother. Savannah. I'm sorry. We're just leaving. I'm sorry, I just had to say my piece. He's never been like this over a girl before. I just can't stand... Leaving now. I'm really sorry. Good to see you again, Dixon. Wait, you knew? You knew this whole time that that girl was Teddy's sister?! Kind of, yeah. Teddy's a player, and he's always going to be one. He didn't hurt you just now, but eventually he would have. I care about you. I just wanted to protect you. No. You have no right to make that decision for me. I don't even want to hear it. What kind of friend are you? I'm just saying it's not always easy listening to Coach cause I'm a way better surfer than he is. - I'm hoping you didn't tell him that. - I did, except I used the words suck my tail***... which is not such a good idea. You okay, Naomi? Yeah! Just taking my time. Enjoying the great outdoors. - Watch out for that poison oak. - What! Where! Sorry, to the left. No, my left. - By the garter snake. - What?! Come on. Sorry I couldn't make it to the top. Stop. Don't be silly. The view isn't even really that great. You might as well just buy the postcard. Would you mind filling up my canteen? I'm really thirsty. You got it. Just so you know, I'm on to you. What? You've been trying to make me look bad because you still like Liam. Okay, Naomi, that's ridiculous. What's worse... You're too much of a coward to admit it. - I am not a coward. - Really? Then come clean. Fine. I like him. I like him a lot. And you know what, you guys suck as a couple. That's not true. So why'd you ask for my help? Just stay away from him. That's going to be hard. We are on the surf team together. Then it's going to be hard for me to not take you down. I'd really like to see you try. You have no idea what you're up against. - Mind if I sit with you? - Sure. I have something I got to tell you. Shoot. Silver was really into you at the Winter Wonderland Dance, and she was going to tell you. But when she saw u with Savannah, she thought that you were flirting with another girl. She was? She did? And I... I let her think that. I really like her And when she was feeling really vulnerable, that's when I kissed her. So, you should know that the kiss didn't mean anything to her. I lied when I said we might be getting back together, and I lied when I told you she wanted you to leave her alone. What the hell, bro? You should punch me. I can give you a bunch of excuses to why I did what I did, all right? I was rejected by Silver. I've been rejected by my birth mom. I failed a math test that I studied for for three frickin' hours. But the truth is, none of that matters. None of those excuses are good enough. So... You should punch me. Okay... - I deserved that. - Yeah, you did. You screwed up. At least you came clean. Well, I feel better. Yeah, me, too. Not better. So... what now? Silver likes you, man. Go for it. Pity party checklist. First thing we need, sad movies. The Way We Were, An Affair to Remember,</i> P.S. I Love You, The Notebook. Not <i>The Notebook.</i> I watched that with Alexa. - <i>Love Story?</i> - Does anyone die? - Yes, and she's so young, too. - Perfect. Alexa, this is Adrianna. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - You, too. So listen, I was wondering if maybe we could talk at some point? Sure. Cool. Well, I'll call you later? Maybe she wants to get back together. - Why else would she want to talk? - Who knows? Maybe she's still mad at me for saying that Rachel McAdams was hot. Did I tell you we got in a fight when we watched <i>The Notebook?</i> I hope it works out. Besides, a true pity party is a solo affair, right? It was actually harder to track down than I expected. I had to call nearly a dozen auto body shops, pretending to be a guy from your insurance company before I struck gold. But I did. I struck gold. They were very cordial, meticulous. They kept excellent records. That photo, however, was a real bonus. - Is this a threat? - It's a present. You know what? - You win. - You want to get back together? No. If you want people to know what I did, then... I'll tell them. I'm going to confess. Well, aren't you cute? You look like a little wet seal. I hope no one clubs you. I think I'll be fine. I'm actually just going to head back into the water with Liam. You have fun, now. I'll just be waiting for him when he gets back. All oiled up! Dixon told me the truth. About the dance and Savannah and everything. Thought Savannah was a girl. Obviously, she's a girl, but I thought that she's a girl-girl, not like a sister-girl. Well, she's a sister-girl. I'm sorry for assuming the worst and for overreacting. You know, and kissing Dixon. He did tell you about that, right? I knew about that. And it's okay. I don't really care. What I care about is what you were going to tell me at the dance... when you were coming up to talk to me before the whole mix-up with my sister-girl. - You wanted to get together? - Yeah. I wanted to get together. So, can we just pick-up where we left off? No. No? I freaked out because I thought you were a player, and, I mean, come on, you are. You've already been with two girls since we'veen back to school, and... That was cause I thought you didn't like me. Now that I know, - things are different... - Teddy, stop. How much could you like me you were able to move on so quickly? I'll take another. Drinking on a school night? Hair of the dog. Last night was a school night, too. You gonna tell on me or something? Those who live in glass houses... Let's just say it's been a rough couple of weeks. I hear that. I'm Laurel. I'm Ryan. Would you excuse me, Ryan, while I go put some real music on that jukebox? Hey, you. - You look good out there. - Aren't you cold? I'm one of those people who usually runs really hot. So, I brought you some food. Figured you'd worked a great, big appetite out there. Sure did. What you got in there? Just some sandwiches. Looks like you got a bunch. Mind if I grab one? - This is really nice of you. Thanks. - My pleasure. Nai brought some sandwich, you want one? No, I'm cool. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, sure. I'll be right back. Turkey and sprouts? Good choice. I'm glad you're enjoying it. - What the... - I'm so sorry. That was totally an accident. Whatever. I'm out of here. - What the hell?! - Sorry. An accident. I'm gonna kill you! Get the hell off me! You crazy... Bitch What is wrong with you? You crazy bitch! Relax, relax. Stop. What the hell is going on? What is going on is that Ivy has been trying to break us up this whole time! That is obviously not what I was trying to do. She's crazy. Stop it! Ever since I asked u for help, you've been working against me. But the truth is, I shouldn't have asked you in the first place. Cause you know what? She's not the problem. We are the problem. I wouldn't have had to ask that she-devil for help if it hadn't been so awkward between us. And I have been trying so hard, so unbelievably hard to be polite and perfect and to prove that we have something in common. But you know what? I am done trying. I'm done. This is me, Liam. I don't give a crap about how to build a boat. And I don't do french fry fights. And I hate nature. I hate it! If you think I am ever, ever going on another hike again, you are out of your freaking mind. And if you don't like me... for who I am, then that's just too damn bad! - I refuse to answer that. - Come on. Come on! - They're different. - But if you had to choose. Had to? - Who's going to make me? - Maybe I am. Now, come on. Spill. Who was better in bed? Keith Richards or Mick Jagger? Sorry, I don't kiss and tell. Here you go. Although... Steven Tyler had it over both of them. Steven Tyler? Your turn. Why are you really drinking on a school night? I'm guessing either you got dumped, or your indie rock band just broke up. I don't have a rock band. You know the best way to get over someone, right? What's that? Hair of the dog. So, what did you want to talk about? I made a huge mistake, and I want to get back together. Why? Are you jealous cause I've been hanging out with Ade? - Cause we're just friends. - No. It has nothing to do with her. It has to do with us and how much I miss you. So... Will you give me another shot? Screw Paris. Screw Paris and music and all that stuff you thought you stole from me. I don't care. Don't you believe that? Room for one more at this pity party? Of course. Sit. What did Alexa say? I was so sure she'd want to get back together. She just wanted to give me back some of my stuff. Sweetie, I'm so sorry. You are fantastic and wonderful. And Alexa is an idiot for ever letting you get away. Whatever. I'd rather hang out with you anyway. All right. We are going to be starting this over. Be prepared to cry. That's why I came. I brought reinforcement. - For you. - For you. What are you doing here? I couldn't stop... thinking about what you said. I want that one-in-a-million chance. - Wait. So you're not gonna...? - Go to the police? No. I love you too much. If you love something, set it free. And if it comes back, then it's yours. Just come back to me, Annie, okay? Feeling any better? Much. Thank you, but I will definitely need you to come back tomorrow. Getting into a girl fight uses muscles I don't usually work out at the gym. Same time? Yes, thank you. - See you then. - See you. You have a visitor. It's all right. He can come in. You didn't really have to come all the way over here. I actually prefer to be broken up with over the phone. It's much less... So, girl fights turn you on? I've been feeling distant from you ever since we got back together. And I couldn't figure out what was wrong, why we weren't connecting. You've been so polite and so unlike the girl that I fell for. I just want everything to be perfect. I guess somehow that translated into me not being myself. I'm glad you're done with that, because the girl that I fell for is ballsy and opinionated and sure of herself. And today... I finally saw her again. You will be seeing a lot more of her. And even after showing what a colossal bitch she is, Liam still chose Naomi. Whatever. He said he had to make things right with her. Clearly, he's an idiot. Yeah, but you have to say that, you're my mom. Come on. You know me. I don't say things just 'cause I have to. That's true. Can I interest you in a toke? It might relax you a little bit. No, I'll pass. Mom, you should really give that stuff up. I don't respond well to "should" either. So did you at least take the princess down #s mano a mano? It was actually kind of a draw. She's pretty scrappy. You hungry? You want to, you know, grab some food or...? I'm cool. Yeah, you are cool. And Liam's an idiot, which is why he and Naomi deserve each other. You know, Mick Jagger was an idiot, too. Why he chose Jerry Hall, I'll never know. No, I'm kidding. - I'm really glad you called. - Me, too. My schedule unexpectedly cleared up. - These chips are insane. - Yeah. They're, like, mental. We have to focus. We have work to do here. I am officially on the quest for the perfect LSD. What? I'm, I'm sorry, LSD? Every girl must have the perfect little sequin dress. The LSD is the most important element to a girl's wardrobe because boys like shiny things. - They're kind of babies in that regard. - Or like trout. True, true. Liam is totally a trout. - So, things are good with you guys? - Yeah, they're good. I am glad. Me, too. I'm glad I didn't chicken out. And I might have a bruise or two and what I think is a dislocated shoulder blade, but I took a risk and I caught me a trout. Okay, but what if your trout turns out to be a huge player? And yes, I may be conflating your fish with my fish. You'll never know unless you try. Where's the waitress? We need some more of these chips. To trout and chips. I don't want to be with you. You made that pretty clear. I want to be with you, I just don't want to want to be with you. - What are you saying? - I'm scared. I like you a lot, and I want to trust you, but I don't. So I'm scared. So, what do we do now? You'd better not hurt me. Protestant and Catholic disagreement about the 1555 Peace of Augsburg - was a cause... - Hundred Years War. Good guess. - Evelyn? - The 30 Years War. What is the Hundred Years War? - Terry? - What is the 30 Years War? I'll take "Confrontational" for $800. After shutting off trade with the UK, President Madisson advised congress to get ready for what would be knonw as this war - 1812. - What is the War of 1812? You're on a roll. No disrespect or anything, but you're a lot smarter than I thought. Rule number one: Never underestimate the dad. I get it. Wait a minute! You TiVoed this! It is? What?! I had no idea! Never underestimate how low the dad will sink. You're here. I'm here. I hope it's okay. Dixon, who's there?
