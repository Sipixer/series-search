and you've never had sex with anyone, including your pregnant fianc√©e? We can't keep this baby. Thank you. Good-bye, Maisie. What is this? - It's my wrap. - You slept with Liam in my bed?! - I didn't do anything. - Get out! I was calling, I was concerned about some underage drinking. She is your sister. She's gonna hate you. She'll never know it's me. - Get out of bed. Get dressed. - What the hell? Your stepfather's fed up! It's over! Pencils down, everybody. Blue books back to me, everybody. See ya! Summer school's over. Summer school's over! Summer school's over?! Oh, my God! Adios, summer school! Suck it, summer school! - What's up? - How are you? - I'm fine. - I'm good. So, the... end-of-summer party's still good for you? Sure. We'll talk then. What's this? You two talking? Are we back together? What did I miss? You just interrupted an ordinary moment by making it extremely awkward. See ya. Never you mind, darling. Let's hit the beach! - Congratulations! - We're free! A whole week without school! Shotgun! We're on summer vacation, suckers! Thank you, Doug. Girls. - Hi, Julian! - Hey, Naomi, ladies. - Why are you giggling like that? - Jason is so witty. Wait. Jason, the guy you met at Barney's? The guy who's twice your age? You should've heard her in class today. She's obsessed. This is good. I am finally going out with a real man. - He's so... - Old? Brilliant. He reads books, you guys, for fun. Like <i>Lolita.</i> I'm telling you, the minute I met him, - a thrill went up my spine. - Excuse me. There's a delivery here for one of your guests. "Adrianna Tate Duncan"? That's me. Thanks, Julian. - Another script. - <i>Monica Lewinsky: A Movie Musical?</i> - She's so annoying. - Who, Monica Lewinsky? Am I the only one who thought she had real talent as a bag designer? Yes. Haven't you told your mom you don't want to act anymore? I think she thinks that I'm gonna cave in, but I'm not. I am done. I don't care if she kicks me out of the house. I'm done with drama on camera and off: taking drugs, going to rehab, getting pregnant, deciding to give the baby up. It really took it out of me. You want to be "No Drama Adrianna." Exactly. No drama. - I just want to be a normal teenager. - Hell to the yes, I hear ya. To being teenagers. Madison, Henley, out of the pool! Either the club's having a show of fashion don'ts or summer school's out for the day. Actually, summer school's out forever. We have nothing to do but just hang out here at the club. I'm sure you're thrilled to the gills about that. You know what? Would you guys like to come to our end-of-summer bash? I think I'm gonna pass. If it were up to me, under-18's wouldn't be allowed to spend time at the club without parental supervision. If it were up to me, over-50's wouldn't be allowed to wear sleeveless shirts. Diving time! I'm ready. They look so cute! Just look at this dress. Are you okay? Yeah, I just... I guess I can't just snap my fingers and become a normal teenager. But that's okay. It's fine, because, I am making different choices: I am not taking drugs, I am taking my time in my relationship. I'm waiting for the right time to have sex. I'm sure Navid's loving that. He gets it. He's really understanding. Understanding-slash-gay. He's is so not gay. He is very, very not gay! He knows I want to wait, so he wants to wait, too. Dude... I'm so getting laid. Hold on. I thought Adrianna wanted to wait. We did. We waited and waited, and last night, she thanked me for being so patient. And then she said she didn't want sex to eclipse everything in our relationship. And I said, "It won't." And then she said, - "I know." - Then she said she was ready, right? She didn't have to. If she knows, there's nothing to worry about - and we're good to go. - Got ya. But, yeah, I kinda need some help. Go buy the Kama Sutra. I'm not showing you how it's done. Not the how, the where and the when. I'm thinking, of coming up with something special. - You know what you need to do? - What? Trick out a cabana at your Beach Club. Keep talking. I don't know... Fill it up with roses, candles, - maybe buy some champagne. - Non-alcoholic for Ade. Cool. Sure. Maybe make a cool mix CD. Set the mood... Like a sex jams CD? I like it. - What songs should I put on it? - Obviously, "Sex Machine." Obviously. - Dude, I'm kidding. - Me, too. Remember, sex is more romantic for girls than it is guys. So think Feist, Norah Jones... Dude, I don't want to fall asleep, but... Believe me, you won't. It's gonna be a big night, my friend. Let's do this. - Here you go. Let's go! - Enough girl talk. I'm so getting laid! This is all Ethan's fault. He scrambled me up about everything. Honestly, it's like he got into my head and I just short-circuited. I can't even tell what I want. But you're still talking with Dixon tomorrow, right? - What are you going to say? - I have absolutely no idea. I keep going back and forth. Dixon. Ethan. Ethan. Dixon. Children. They are both children. Seriously, I don't know why you're so stuck on high school boys. - High school boys know nothing about... - Books? For one thing. How to pleasure a woman, for another. Jason has these hands. They're, like, man hands. I'm telling you, I cannot wait to have those hands all over this corpus... Those kinds of thoughts you need to keep inside your head. I'm just saying, Liam's hands weren't nearly as big and meaty as Jason's. Big and meaty? What about Liam? Where is he? What's he up to? I heard that he moved back to Long Island. He's probably tormenting some hairspray chick with French manicured toenails as we speak. Vomit. - Thank God I got over that jerk. - Amen. It's actually ridiculous how long it took me to get over him. He screwed that little skank in my bed. - You think that would've done the trick. - Wait. I have to point something out. You didn't actually find Annie in bed with Liam. You found her wrap. That's circumstantial evidence. She did it. She slept with him in my bed, and then she called the cops on my party. - Three people heard her. - I know that she called the cops. I'm not saying Annie's not a rat. She's a rat, but come on. A skank? I don't know. I know. She did it. And she needs to be punished. What? I wondered if you wanted to go for a walk. Check out the new neighborhood. Get a little sun. I don't. What's wrong? Other than the fact that you, for some reason, will not leave my room? UNIDENTIFIED MAN FOUND CRITICALLY INJURED ON... JOHN DOE COMATOSE AFTER HIT AND RUN MYSTERY DRIVER STILL AT LARGE Flip! - Oh, my God! - What? - He's here! - Who? - Jason! - Mr. Man Hands? I did not know he belonged to the club. You guys have to meet him. Daddy's here! How are you? - Good day? - Hi, honey.</i> ******* CREDITS********* ******* CREDITS********* I'm glad that you're trying to get over Mr. Man Hands, but do you really think that exercise is the key? Who said anything about exercise? I'll show you how I'm going to get over Jason. Speak of the devil. There he is. Act natural. That's Tennis Guy. Is he hot or is he hot? - Jason who, right? - He's hot. What's with the squint? - Just looking for a wedding ring. - Come on. Believe it or not, I haven't actually played that much tennis. I'm sure I'll pick it up pretty quick, though. I'm no expert, but I'm thinking we should be on opposite sides of the net. I'm just warming up my old serve. Remember, the objective of the game is... Hit the ball into Tennis Guy's court. Oh, my God. I am so, so sorry. Pink, huh? That way I can tell they're mine. I'm very possessive when it comes to balls. - You could always go by the numbers. - I don't do anything by the numbers. I got to say, I like the way you handle balls. The way you're saying that, it almost sounds sexual. It's meant to. Do you go to school around here? - We go to West Beverly. - Do we look like we're in high school? No kidding. I'm starting there this semester. You are? I was going to Exeter for the last couple years, but, I guess I just missed L.A. The weather, the beach. Mostly the girls. I'm Teddy. - Nice to meet you. - This is Silver. Silver with her Silver tongue. Flirt with her. This whole Vicky Cristina Barcelona thing - is not really my cup of tea. - Sure thing, Vicky. She's... just very serious about her tennis. You two know each other. Guys, this is Teddy. Teddy Montgomery. My old boyfriend from summer camp. It's so nice to see you. All right. The burgers will be up in a minute. Here you go, Harry. Here's your beer. All right. To new beginnings. New beginnings. Is that some kind of jab at me? Of course not. We're just celebrating. Come on. We got a new house. A new school year. Grandma's got a show in Vegas. - Things are good. - Whatever. Are you going to this party at the Beach Club? Yeah, right. You know what? I think that you do need a new beginning. You decided to call the cops on the party. Your friends are mad at you. Deal with it. I'm not hungry. Honey, we're here as a family. Don't go. This is nice. Let her go. Whatever this is, she's going to have to deal with it. Your search inquiry received: 1 result</i> COMATOSE HIT AND RUN VICTIM DIES IN HOSPITAL "John Doe" died at 3:00am today at Los Angeles...</i> Just drive somewhere. Anywhere that's not here. I need to talk to you. All right. I'm still completely mind-boggled by the fact that Tennis Guy Teddy is Teddy Montgomery. Athletic, charming and oh, yes, his dad is one of the biggest movie stars in the universe. But I can't date him because he used to date my best friend. Honestly, that was like years ago. He's all yours, trust me. No way. You were crazy about him. - What if you want him back? - I have a boyfriend. It's okay. This place is loaded with man meat. Just need to find myself a nice, fresh side of beef. How about an old, maggoty, married side of beef? 1 New Text Message From: Ethan So, what is it? What's going on? Something happened... On the night of prom. Something bad. I did something really bad. I think maybe I know. What do you mean? You slept with Liam? What? I know before you told me that you didn't, but you can tell me the truth. I'm not going to judge you or anything. I'm sorry. What?! You know what you got to do now. You got to apologize to Naomi. That's what you think? Yeah, I do. And I think you have a problem with apologizing. What? Come on, I spent the whole summer in summer school because of you. And you never apologized once?! - That's pretty messed up. - Oh, my God! You can't do it, can you? You can't say you're sorry. Two words. "I'm sorry." - You're incredible. - Screw you! Screw you, too. How you doing, Julian? So good to see you. - How you been? - Good. I just came here to, - rent a cabana. - Absolutely. Just have your parents come in and sign for it. - My parents, right. - You got to be over 18. Gotcha. What was I thinking? No problem, man. I'll send for them... That's a good rule. I am not going to this party. - You can't leave me here. - Watch me. The world doesn't revolve around you, Annie. I'm telling you, I'm not talking to you. Come on, Naomi, you are. You see? You're talking. You're married. Technically, yes. But not in here. You know, when we met at Barney's... I've never felt like that before. Honestly. It sent a thrill up my spine. It did? Are you kidding me? You're a special girl, and I think what we have between us is special. I know it's a little inconvenient that I'm married, but I'm sure we can find some way of working around it. Because I think we're bigger than labels. And... I do know you, Naomi. And you know me. Jason, hold that thought. What are you doing here, Annie? I don't want to be here, believe me. I will be gone soon, okay? Don't turn your back on me. I did not have sex with Liam, Naomi. Right. You didn't call the police either, did you? Get out of here. And stay the hell away from me. Is everything okay, sweetheart? Come on. You think you know me. You don't know me. I may be a lot of things, but I will tell you what I'm not. I am not a cheating skunk Are you okay? Julian, I think... he needs some water. I don't know what's wrong - Take a sip. It's okay. - I'll get some help. Come on, you'll feel better. Thanks, man. All right, look, are we good? So good. All right, look, It'll be even better later. - Just trust me. - All right, I trust you. You never forget your first time, man. Let's go down in history. Teddy, this is my boyfriend Navid. Navid, this is Teddy. - Navid, good to meet you, man. - Nice to meet you. We went to summer camp together. I've known him since I was, what? Eight. Eight? That's crazy. Right. What's in the bag? My mom... she was here the other day, and, she forgot some stuff, so I'm gonna go stash it in the car. But I'll be right back. Nice to meet you. Nice meeting you too, man. So... Cool party, huh? - It's cool. - Cool. So you want to go... So... Well... I guess it's time to talk. Do you want to be back together? Well, good, 'cause what I was going to say was, I missed you. I missed you, too. Look, Dixon, it's me. I can't find you and I need to get out of here, at least just give me the keys, so I can just wait in the car, okay? Please. Please call me back. I'm Mark. I know who you are. You're a junior. Or a senior, now. Wait a sec. I know you. You're the principal's daughter. You are the one that called the cops on Naomi Clark's party. I really don't feel like talking, okay? Well, how about drinking? Why not, right? Why not? Vicky. It's Silver, actually. Is this your phone? I found it down by the beach. - Yeah. Thank you. - Unless... Maybe I got a text from someone named Ethan, - saying... - Stop. "I've decided to stay in Montana. The worst part is leaving you. I'm still thinking about that kiss." It's not funny, Teddy. Do you want to... - Stop, yeah. We should stop. - Go somewhere more private, maybe? What? Or stop. We can stop. That's an option. We've talked about this. - About waiting. - We have waited... And I thought we mastered the whole waiting thing. I thought maybe we were ready to... Not wait. We love each other, and... I thought this would be a physical manifestation of our multifaceted, emotional, intellectual love. Sex changes things, though. And change is good. Change we can believe in. You're not... This not sleeping together thing, this is already a big change for me. I used to meet someone, sleep with him immediately, and then it was just sex, sex, sex. Sex everywhere. Sex all the time. Sex... Sounds awful. After sex comes drama. It's inevitable. This is really hard for me. But I do know that I don't want my life filled with drama. I want to be normal. I want to be No Drama Adrianna. Fine. Then, I'll just be No Sex Navid. Are you mad? At you? Never. How'd you score a cabana? Here. Go ahead. Knock yourself out. Come on. Come on. - Dixon right? - Yeah man, How's it going? Good music. Pretty girls. Can't complain. Yeah, I hear you. You haven't seen Silver have you? She's about... yea high. Rihanna bob. She's, probably off texting that dude. What dude? Some Ethan character's messing with her head. About what? I don't know. They kissed. I don't know. I have no idea. She is a prickly one, that Sil... ver. How's it going? It's good, just, you know, getting the lay of the land. Do you recognize this? Is this... Oh, God. We scored second place at the camp talent show dancing to that song. Come on. - Let's do our thing. - That was, like, four years ago. Follow my lead. Give me some of that. Geez. Look at him. He's so friggin' hot. He'd be the answer to all my problems. If only Ade hadn't banged him, I'd be all over that. Excuse me? For real. I'd do him right here, right now. Wait. Ade had sex with that guy? Oh, relax. Not recently. Way back when they used to date. Doesn't help me much. I can't go there, because he was her first. - You never forget your first. - Exactly. What is this...? You and me, we're done. What? Why don't you text Ethan and cry on his shoulder about it? - Want one? - Yeah. Thanks. Are you okay? Terrific. Couldn't be better. Where is that girl? Of all the lowdown, awful, dirty... - Listen, whatever you think... - Think? I don't think. I know, because I saw it with my own eyes. What did you see? My caba√±a. What? I came down to the club tonight to start decorating it for my daughter's very special sixth birthday tomorrow, only to find that it has been completely trashed, and I am sure one of you did it. Someone trashed your... Your "cabanya"? That's why you're upset? Geez. Which one of you did it, huh? Which one of you left behind this... Sex jams CD? Fine. I'll shut down the music, and we'll all wait around until someone admits to it. Oh, man, this... This is embarrassing. I'm Teddy. Teddy Montgomery. Oh, and this is yours? Well, actually, it's my father's. Maybe you've heard of him. Spence Montgomery. Spence Montgomery. - Of course. As in... - As in. He doesn't like to sign out the cabanas at the front desk because you never know who's gonna tip off the paparazzi. - Of course. - I'm sure you understand. Anyway, he told me he made a huge mess down here. I was supposed to take care of it, but I got caught up. And I'm really sorry. I think I can let it go just this once. Really? You just tell your dad he owes Bitsy Epstein one. Oh, does he ever! Could I just get his CD back? Of course. Toodle-loo. Thank you. That was incredible. Okay, two questions. Whose was it? And... What the hell is a sex jams CD? Thanks a lot. You just ruined my whole life. I can't breathe. Sweetie, it's going to be okay. I'm sorry I didn't tell you guys I was texting Ethan. I was just... So confused. So he's gonna stay in Montana? And when I found out... The choice was easy? Yeah, but... Not like that. When I learned that Ethan was moving across the country, it suddenly became clear. Because I wasn't disappointed. I was relieved. And then I imagined what if... Dixon moved across the country. And I thought, if I lost Dixon, I wouldn't be able to breathe. And I can't breathe. I can't breathe. - Man, do it! - Do it, bro! Oh, wipeout! Get a car. Where's Silver? I hope she's okay. I know. I've never seen her so sad in, like, a non-bipolar state. How you doing? You know what? I'm okay. Because I'm gonna get him back. Me and Dixon... we are not done. I'm done. I'm done. You sure? Am I sure? She's been texting Ethan. I'm done. I'm doner than done. I'm overcooked. And Silver, she's dead to me, man. I'm officially single. Officially. Officially... single. - Hey, ladies. How you doing? - Come on. What do we think about Tom from the water polo team? He's tall, handsome... He doesn't drive the best car. You're right actually, cars matter. What about Diego? You guys remember him? He was in my Spanish class last year. I thought he was like a language genius. - Turns out he actually was Spanish. - I got to stop you. You have something against Spaniards? I have something against you going from guy to guy to guy like this. - Seriously, slow down. - I can't. - Why? - It doesn't matter. It does. Why are you so desperate? Because... Because if I don't have another guy to focus on... then all I can think of is Liam. I thought you were over him. Well, I'm not. I really wish I were, but I'm not. Why didn't you tell us? 'Cause I should be over him. Because he cheated on me and then moved to another frickin' state. But if I don't have someone else to distract me 24-7, then my mind just goes right back to him, and all I can think about is Liam, Liam, Liam, Liam, Liam. I got to talk to you. What's up? Not much. All right, well, I'll see you around. No way. Dude, I'm telling you. The principal's daughter? Bull. You know, I expected such skepticism... which is why I was sure to get proof. What is it they say, a picture is worth a thousand words? I thought I told you to stay the hell away from me. I bet Naomi'd like to see that. See what? - Nothing. It's just this... - It's not nothing. Oh, my God. Is that naked girl Annie? What are you doing? - What did you...? - Thank you very much. There you are. Are you okay?
