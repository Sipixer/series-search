Talk to your friend Naomi. She's got a copy of the picture, too. You and me, we're done. I made a mistake. It doesn't mean that it's over. Whatever, man, she's been lying to me all summer. Now I'm free... new year, new Dixon. Why did you return to Beverly Hills? Maybe you were so busy sleeping around that you can't remember who you did or didn't sleep with. I'm a journalist. Journalists don't pull punches. Yeah, well, they also don't attack someone just because that person used to date their girlfriend. Please don't send out that picture. It's going to ruin my life. Naomi, what are you doing? I'm sending out that text. I know you think she's evil, but... I don't think. I know. Trust me, this... Why? Clearly you're on her side. Nice rack. I found this homeless guy. He'd been mowed over by a hit-and-run driver. No reason... you walked up and clocked a guy for no reason. That's not good enough. I guess I was just having a bad day. And this is how you deal with it? How do you think this reflects on me, on our family? You're worried about what I'm doing to our family's reputation? Really? What about Annie? Annie is not hitting people. Okay... fine. You want to know why I did it? Yes. I hit that guy because he took a topless picture of Annie and sent it to everybody in the school. - You should get to lunch. - Can I go to lunch? Yeah, yeah, go. Go. hey. Hey, um, so I found some of your things at my place. Oh, cool, thanks. Yeah, just some random stuff... a few dvds, oh, and, like three of your socks. I have no idea how I ended up with three of your socks, but well, now they're back safe and sound with their owner. That's a relief, I'm sure, for the sock community. Hell's hospital. Do you remember that? Yeah, at that horror festival in pasadena, yeah. You know, you can keep it. I'm probably not gonna watch it again. No way, it's yours. No, honestly, it's cool. Honestly, I hate horror movies. Oh, that's funny, 'cause we saw plenty of them. Yeah, 'cause you picked every movie we went to. I had to pick every movies. Otherwise, we'd end up watching that sappy sports crap that you love. Well, lucky for you, that never happened. I mean, we always just did what u wanted to do. Every movie, every concert, every meal... all you. Oh, is that right? Yeah, that's right. What are you saying? I'm saying I was never really myself around you. Well, then it's a good thing we broke up. Oh! - Oh, I am so sorry. - Ah, I'm sorry. Oh, no, I'm an idiot, I'm an idiot. Hey, as long as my iced coffee didn't spill. I need this stuff to get through French. Hey, I know you. I know you... I... I know you from somewhere. It's not that big a school, so... No, it's not from school. It's from someplace specific. Man, it is right on the tip of my brain. No, I've got one of those faces, you know, so... Do you ever play in any tennis tournaments? No. Annie! How about another picture? Ah, right, that was... Yeah, I'm that girl. Mm, I guess that's how I recognize you. I guess so. Well, that awkward silence was your cue. You don't have to walwith me. I think we're going to the same place. You know, this whole... photo thing... don't sweat it. By tomorrow, people will be on to the next thing. what are you staring at? This is your fault. Me? I didn't write that. Yeah, well, you might as well have. He's such a jackass. Okay, I'm nice enough to bring all of his stuff back and he spits on me. Oh, my God, Dixon spat on you? Metaphorically. Easy does it. You're the one spitting. I am not. Yes, you are. My hamachi negi maki is soaked. Such a jackass. Mmm, still good, though. How could you do this to me? Okay, sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. But then again, I don't speak skank. Maybe I could find an interpreter. You sent out that "sext," Naomi. After I personally came to you and begged you not to. I begged you. Why don't you save the little scene for your acting reel, Meryl? I never saw the photo before today. Girls, come on. Silver... Got your text. What, you got a new rule about who I can and can't talk to in the lunchroom? No, I just need yournput. I'm trying to edit this piece. Um, I don't... Just tell me what you think. Okay? okay? Okay. So... when was the last time you made such an ass out of yourself? Last Spring... maybe in chemistry... when I asked my teacher for extra assignments over the summer to "keep things fresh." It's true. That's fairly standard high school ass-kissing. This gaffe is much worse, isn't it? I guess it is. No, there's no guessing. You were a jealous imbecile. A raging lunatic, a pathetic... Easy, you don't have to attack me. Excuse me, but I'm a journalist and journalists don't pull punches. You must be paranoid. So tell us, Mr. Shirazi, 'cause the whole world would like to know... Why... why you couldn't control yourself. Because of her. Okay? Because of Adrianna. Because she's, like, so far out of my league that I feel like I'm dreaming. She's with me? Seriously? I defy you to look into those eyes and not lose your mind. Go on... I dare you. Whoa. Dude. I see what you mean. It's true. Come here. Need any help? I come bearing paper towels. There are some real jerks in this place. I'll say. Look, I know Naomi is acting nuts around you, but it's only because she's still crazy about Liam. So get over it. I don't think she can. She's one of the strongest people I know, and liam can just send her off the deep end. I guess everybody has their weakness. Why are you telling me this? Because I'm sick of this whole thing. I want to be your friend and want to be her friend, too. No, y... you can't have it both ways. She didn't send the sext. Of course she sent it. She said she'd never seen that picture before today. Yeah, because she's lying, Silver. Don't you get it? She wants to screw me over. I'm innocent here and she's a bitch, and I... I'm going to prove it. I am going to expose her for who she really is. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-Proudly Presents -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-Sync: YTET-sunshine_zp Â¶Â¬ÃƒÃŸÂµÃ„Ã–Ã­  </font> corrected by chamallow35 So your nut-job brother just sucker- punched me. Almost broke my haw. So I'm gonna take that as a little sign that you and I probably shouldn't be hanging out. Yeah, well, you're the one who did this. You took the picture. Okay? You have to help me. Please? All right, but it's going to cost you. What about her shoving her box in my face, huh? Sorry, what? Silver and her box of socks. "Here! Take this! Now" That doesn't strike you as hostile? Dude, maybe she just wants to give you your crap back. No. No, no, no. All right, you're missing the point. Okay, tha... tha... that stupid movie, the Ramones cds, the goofy calligraphy set that she wanted us to do together... all her. Oh, yo, I'll take the calligraphy set. I mean, if you're throwing it away. I was so whipped. So whipped. But you know what? The past is the past. My next woman... she's gonna be all about the d-man. I'm going to find me a female Dixon. Okay, I'm picturing the start of a very bad Tyler Perry flick. Hey, guys. What up, t? Teddy. So there's going to be this party on my dad's yacht this Saturday. The weather should be nice, so... I know, late notice and all, but, uh... What do you say? Well, actually, Navid and I... we have plans. Well, we'll reschedule. Uh, no... party sounds awesome, dude. Thanks for the invite, man. Cool, man. Navid. I thought you hated that guy. Yeah, not a fan. I thought he was a sleazeball. Huge sleazeball. I mean, that story about him nailing those girls at Exeter? He's a pig. So we're going to his party on Saturday because... Because Adrianna likes him and I love Adrianna. And if I act all jealous in front of her, then it's only going to drive her away. It's psych 101, dude. I need to reassure her by being super-tight with Teddy. Operation overcompensate. Watch and learn. Yeah, um, okay. Look, I'm breezing before your, uh, geek squad shows up. Oh, damn, dude, the Blaze meeting. I spaced on time. I didn't even order the pizzas. I was too busy listening to you gripe about Silver. I'm not gonna get the pizzas. Totally understand, dude. Guess I'll find someone else who wants to drive the Lambo. Hey, uh, let me have three pizzas. Uh, two pepperoni and one with anchovies. Safe! Safe! He missed the tag! Yes! Oh, yes! baseball fan, huh? Oh, I go through some serious withdrawal in October. Oh, tell me about it. After that last yankee game of the season I walk around in a daze. Yankees? $200 million payroll and you still can't catch Boston? Oh, please don't tell me you're a Red Sox fan. Oh, hell, no. I grew up a mile from Camden Yards. Baltimore? Oh... geez, girl, please, come out from the cellar and get some air. 12 straight losing seasons? We're young, okay? And we're building. We're young, look at, look at, uh, Jones, 24, Reimold, 25. - I mean, your starting pitching's still a mess. - Yeah. But we have talent coming up within the system, okay? Oh, wait, wait, who's this talking about minor league ball? Oh, yeah, it's the girl with no post-season contender in the bigs... no, no, it's okay, though. It's okay, you know, I'm focused on October. I'm Dixon, by the way. Hi, Dixon, I'm Sasha. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Being intimate with someone is a big deal, Annie. Did you... I mean, you didn't, did you? No, I did not do it with him, if that's what you're asking. Okay, but you did do something. And I'll tell you something Annie, this world isn't always fair to women. If you're sexually active with a guy that you don't care about, it's not going to hurt his reputation, it's going to hurt yours. this is real, annie. This is your life we're talking about. Look, don't take your bitterness out on me just 'cause you've had like no sexual experience. Annie, that's enough. You're grounded. Fine. Harry... No, I am sick of this. This is stopping today. Why do you always swoop in and save me when I'm dealing with the kids? I don't need to be saved. No, I'm not gonna let her talk to you like that. Harry, you always do this. You know what you alwayso? You always try to be their friend. Sometimes they don't need a friend, they need a parent. Dude, where did you go for pizza, Big Sur? Listen, listen, I'm telling you, I just met my dream girl, okay? She's like the female Dixon. That is never going to sound sexy. She go to West Bev? No, no, no, um, Archer? Crossroads, maybe. Uh, I don't know but look, I gotta go. I gotta go, I gotta go, bye, bye. Ugh, one second. What? Okay, all right, I heard you the third time. Extra cheese. Bye. Nice ringtone. Thank you, thank you. You the, you the best likewise. You the, you the best you the, you the best... Hey. Yeah. Where's the gig? They, they the same people who hired me for the HBO party? And I'm the only dj? Okay, yeah, yeah, cool. I'll be there. All right, bye. Wow! So you dj? I do. That's pretty cool, seriously. You know, I've always wanted to try it myself. So how long you been at it? Uh, let's see. I started spinning in college, then I had my first paying gig the summer after I graduated. And full time since then. Wow. Wow. So, when am I going to see you again? Uh... how about this weekend? I got a gig on Saturday. But Sunday's open. Okay, Sunday it is. Okay, cool. Let me give you my digits. All right. One second, let me just, uh... Thanks. Nice ride. Um, it gets me where I need to go. So, Sunday. Sunday. Don't forget! Sunday. Hotter than beyonce, huh? Most definitely. What about Megan Fox? Whew. Sasha blows her away. Golshifteh Farahani? Oh, come on, dude... Santori, Divar? Bab'aziz, remember? Dudes, you just need to see some more Iranian movies. So, seriously guys, uh, I need to take her somewhere that'll really impress her. The grove's nice. No! All right, dude. Sasha's a grown woman. She's gonna want something a little more sophisticated. Then what's she doing with you? Ooh-hoo! Oh-ho! Wow! Was that a joke? Yeah, that was, I think that was a joke. Yore in high school. Yeah? And? And she doesn't know you're in high school. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You ever just consider telling her the truth? You know, maybe if you level with her... Easy there, nature boy. All right? This isn't one of your campfire honesty sessions. This is the real world. I'm going to be straight with her, but when the time's right. But until then, can I just bask in my present glory, please? Go ahead. Bask away. I got to go. All I did was defend her. Turns out that's a bad thing. I... I don't know. Well, I'm sure that that you and Debbie will figure it out. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, I grounded Annie. You think that I can't detect nonverbal disapproval? I have two teens at home. Was it Annie's fault that some jerk snapped her picture? Well, I think it was her bad judgment that put her in that situation, so shouldn't there be consequences? I mean, I know punishment's a dirty word these days, but... every kid in the school has seen that text. Maybe she's been punished enough. I'm... I'm not sure. I'm not sure of anything these days. Don't be so hard on yourself, Harry. All I can say is, I am glad there were no camera phone things when I was here... You were pretty crazy, huh? I, uh... I pretty much foreshadowed the whole girls gone wild craze. Oh. Red light love makes my heart stop drives me so crazy I can't even walk I got a red light love hoping every day he don't green light go... could probably solve the state budget crisis with what this stupid yacht costs. I know! And to think I was actually impressed by Usher's speedboat last summer. Oh, my God. Has she no shame? You know, I don't think this is such a good idea. Would you relax? It's going to be painless, okay? And don't forget about our agreement. I think I might be adding to our little contract. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nobody knows how I used to be but I remember... Welcome aboard. Guys. How's it going, homeboy? Ah. So glad you could make it. Yeah, yeah. Dude, there's no place I'd rather be. You probably have a lot of people to see, so I think we're just going to go walk... Hey, not so fast. Don't you want the tour? We want... we want to see everything, bro. Don't leave out a single seat cushion. Yo, this is a nightmare. First time Sasha sees me, she thinks I'm Jay Z. Now she sees me again, and I'm at a high school party with an angry ex-girlfriend. What am I going to do? How good of a swimmer are you? Right. Look, Dix. You want to go through with this, we got your back. We'll play into your story. Yeah, we'll say we're old high school buddies. Wait. What about Silver? Obviously, we have to kill Ssilver. Dude, that was... That was a joke man. I'm playing. All we have to do is just make sure silver does not meet Sasha. - All right? - That's no problem. Piece of cake. All right, I can do this. - You can do this. - You can do this. I can do this. I can do this. Dixon?! Sasha? What are you doing here? I'm working the party. What... Are you friends with... Y... yeah, the, the Montgomerys. - Ah... - Yeah, yeah. So, uh, you know, uh, while you're on the job, is there any rules against you mixing with the guests? None that I can remember. Okay. You said you alway wanted to try dj-ing, right? Yeah, yeah, you know, I thought it would be a nice way to, to, you know, uh, chill, to relax. To relax? When you're not... I'm sorry, huh? What do you do for a living? Oh... you know, I'm... I'm in the music business. I'm, I'm an exec. Well, Mr. Big exec, you want to be my assistant for a few? - Try matching some beats? - Yeah, sure. - Yeah? - Definitely. All right, go easy now. Adjust the pitch control of both tables. Uh-huh, and get a feel for moving the cross fader. Uh-huh, that's it. Not bad at all. Ah, I love the feeling of being on the ocean. It totally turns me on. Ew, Naomi. Suddenly I feel seasick. Hi, Silver. Tell her. Naomi texted herself the photo from my phone. She practically grabbed it out of my hand. Shut up, you goon. Later. Naomi, you said you'd never seen the picture before. Oh, because she'd never be untruthful, now, would she? Did you do this? Okay, listen, I had every right to. She slept with my guy and sh... Whatever... okay, look, I told you that I was going to prove this to you, so see, I'm a good person and she's a lying sociopath. Just wanted to set the record straight. I can't even deal with you two. Silver, wait. Silver. You think you won this little battle? Guess what, honey? You just started a war. She's on Spence Montgomery's yacht? Well, she was all, "wow, big movie star party. Please." I... I get it. What happened to the whole "kids need a parent" argument? What happened to consequences? Well, I was talking with Kelly at school, and I came around. - You and Kelly discussed this? - Yeah. She's smart about these things. I don't know, maybe it's 'cause she's a guidance counselor and she deals with these kids 24/7, but she thought maybe Annie had been punished enough. Unbelievable. What? You can't hear it from me, but Kelly says the exact same thing and it comes through loud and clear. You know, I... I can't stand this. I can't live this way; it's not fair. Whoa, what is going on? Take it easy. Don't tell me to take it easy. If you just had the guts to tell Naomi who you slept with, none of this would be happening. Look, I told you I can't do anything about that. Yeah, you can. I can't do this anymore. I'm ending this today. Okay, I'm not about to fight some war that I can't win. It's easy. We just go to Naomi together, tell her the truth. We're innocent. We didn't have sex. She needs to know that. You owe me this. Great party. What's wrong? Some chick with short black hair keeps giving me the stink eye. Uh, okay, look, uh, here's the deal. That, that girl... she's my ex. I di't know she was going to be here today or anything, you know, but... we're cool, it's cool. You going to introduce me to her? We're not that cool, no, but, um... You know, she didn't take the breakup that well, so, you know, it'd be best if you just... keep your distance, you know. Yeah. Naomi. Ugh, what do you two want? We need to tell you the truth about that night, Naomi. Prom night. We totally slept together. - But it wasn't the first time, - What? we've actually been having sex the whole time that you guys were together, which is just not right, okay? What are you doing? No, Liam, we promised that we'd get all of this out. - All right, you can't go back on me now. - Naomi, she's lying to you. No, no! And the worst part that I feel so, so bad about is after we'd have sex, we'd actually just kind of lie there making fun of you for hours. It's kind of funny though. I mean even you love ends up loving me more. First Ethan, then Liam. Who's gonna be next? You done good, bro. Oh, my goodness, man. I am pinching myself. Oh, man, I wish this boat would settle down, man. All right, guys, we're gonna take a little break now so y'all can check out the sunset. Dixon! Hey, Dixon! Everything okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. - Actually, um, I gotta go handle something really fast. - Okay. Uh, so I'll be right back. But this is Navid. - Oh, hi. - Hi, Navid. - Nice to meet you, Sasha. - Nice to meet you, yeah. Navid is my assistant. Yeah. Anything you need, he'll be glad to help. Right? Just keep her away from Silver. Uh, yeah, you got it, boss. Thanks, man. See you in a minute. Can I get you a beverage, bottled water or something? Liam, what the hell is going on? I could kill her, I swear to God. She totally blindsided me! Hold on, wait, wait, wait. Who are you talking about? Who blindsided you? Your psycho sister. I can't take it. I can't take it. So, what's he really like as a boss? You know, off the record. He's, a, uh, the nicest guy you could ever work for. Are you okay? Do you... Whoa, buddy, you are looking a little green. This could go real bad real fast, okay? Yeah, I know, come on. The stern is where you want to be right now. Club soda, please. So, are you here with Dixon? Yes, well, no. - Which one? - I didn't come with him. But I met him before. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. How long ago? Just the other night. Thanks. He seems like a great guy. Yeah, he does seem like that. I'm Sasha. Silver. Are you in the music business like Dixon? No. No, I'm not. Look, just pick a point on the horizon and take deep breaths. Look, I'm fine. Besides, I don't think there's an audience here to cheer you on for playing nurse, so you can get back to the party. You don't like me, do you? This is not a junior high girl question. I'm serious. What are you talking about, man? Come on, all the eye rolls, the sarcasm... - What's your problem? - Okay for real, dude, you strike me as kind of a sleaze. Why, 'cause I like the ladies? Well, yeah, partly and because you use terms like "the ladies." It's your whole persona, man. It's like that story you told in the interview about the two freshman girls at Exeter. "Oh, uh, I never kiss and tell." "Oh, that's all so amusing, my friend." Okay, off the record? It wasn't me. I didn't even know those girls to say hi to. Yeah, I don't follow you. The girls at Exeter. They were with my idiot roommate. But you got kicked out. He was a scholarship kid. He really loved the school. Wait, so you're saying that you took the fall for your roommate? I wanted to come home anyway. But in the Blaze interview, why didn't you clear your name? Because he'd still get booted if anyone found out. Wow. Forget about it. You're a good guy. I cannot believe you lived through that. I know. My God! - Amazing! - It was hilarious. So, you ladies have met? - Yeah, yep. - Yeah. I was just telling Silver how cool it was to meet a guy I had so much in common with. Yeah, I mean, you both love baseball, you're both in the music business. Yeah, well, I'm not as successful as Dixon is. But, I mean, a Lamborghini? Come on, get out of town. Oh, man, I didn't know you were driving a Lambo. Better mileage. I'm gonna let you guys have some alone time. - Nice to meet you. - Nice meeting you. And, um, I'm so glad that you finally found someone you can really be yourself with. Poor Navid. I can't believe he seasick. Relax. He's fine now. Oh, man, I wish my dad could have seen you today. He's still not showing up to his own parties? Paramount practically had to kidnap him to make sure he showed up to accept his first oscar. - I believe it. - Yeah Still know your way around the boat, huh? Uh, I guess so. God... do you remember your first time here? Sort of. You had just finished wrapping that indie film in New York. And you'd just lost that really big tennis tournament, and you were sort of down, remember? I think the clinical term for it is suicidal, but, yeah. Suicidal, yes. And then you cheered me up with a promise. Remember what you said? I'm going to see you play at Wimbledon someday? Uh, yep. That's it. I remember. We were hungry, and we both ended up down here, and... and before we knew what was happening, we... had our very first... Uh, yeah, I should, um, go give this to my boyfriend. Yeah. Yeah. That was some party. - Yeah, it was okay. - No, and Teddy's awesome. For real, Ade. A real stand-up guy. And I... I think we're gonna be great friends. - That's so cool. - Yeah. Of all the pizza joints in all the towns in all the world, you just had to walk into mine. Oh, my God, Casablanca... Is the best... Oh, movie ever. - But you know what? - What? I was there first. Yeah, you walked into my pizza joint. Okay, okay, well, uh, we'll always have pizza. Look, if you want me to leave, I... - Stay. I don't care. - Okay. Guess you hate me, too. God knows everybody else does. I don't hate you. I mean, sending that text was nasty. The way you treat Annie is... psycho. And watching me defend you when you knew that you were lying really sucks. Wait. This is your way of saying you don't hate me? You're a piece of work, Nay. When I saw how Annie attacked you on the boat... it was so cruel. All of a sudden, I couldn't really blame you. Thanks. Maybe annie's right. Everyone I loved did wind up loving her more. I don't know if I'll ever find anyone. Are you kidding me? You're Naomi Clark. You rule West Bev. Snap your fingers, and you can have anyone you want. There's no one more confident, more popular. Confident? No, no, that's you. You're the one who doesn't give a crap what the crowd thinks. You're the true original. Yeah, that's why I do things like... I went to have it removed yesterday. I found out it takes seven sessions and eight months. - It still hurts? - Yeah. More than I realized. 'Cause it takes a long time to make someone fade away. Is it true he's here with some older chick? Sasha. Who thinks that he's a music exec with a $200, 000 car. And I just... Played along. It's pathetic, huh? I thout I was over him, but here I am. Are you crazy? Can't you see how much progress you made today? You could have totally busted him back there. The chick gave you a loaded gun. I mean, me... I would have at least grazed him. You're amazing. I could have broken his arms. See what I mean? You're practically Mrs. Gael Garcia Bernal. Okay, now, that has a nice ring to it. See? You'll be over him in no time. You're doing great. So are you, you know. Well, I'm gonna turn in. Good night. Night, hon. You free for lunch? You know what we should do? We should throw Teddy a party. It could be a "welcome back to socal." We could do it at my place. - Maybe. - Yeah? Hey, guys. - Navid? - Yes? I kind of sort of need to borrow the car. You know, you're kind of a douche to work for. I know. I owe you. - Okay. - Thanks, man. Hey. So... So...? Well, you owe me, right? A deal's a deal. All right. Uh, give me just sec, okay? I'll meet you outside. Want to see how she feels? Why not? Alright, look, no traffic, this puppy can get us to Beverly Hills in about... 7 minutes. Oh yeah, too bad we're not going to Beverly Hills. Wait. That's where I live. It's still the weekend. Wasn't our date supposed to be tomorrow? Yeah, but... Well, it started early then. You may want to click that.
