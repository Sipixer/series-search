I've been exaggerating my injuries. I can carry my own bag. What? I really liked spending time with you, And I just thought that if I was better, That you wouldn't want to hang out anymore. It-it doesn't matter. I'm sorry I took advantage of you. You're officially off the hook. What hook? We're friends. Just because of some car accident... Who cares how we met? The point is, we did. And being in an accident Affected us both, and we get each other. More than that, We like each other. At least, that's what I thought. I don't know, maybe-maybe you're getting - Sick of me or something. - No. - I-i'm not. - Okay. Good. But we have to be honest with each other from now on. 'cause life's too short for dishonesty.

Oh, my god, you should see The valentine's day menu they have. Yeah? It's beyond. Lucky you. Of course, I don't have a date to go with to the restaurant.

I should get going pretty soon, anyway, But I assume I'll see you you at the dance? Oh, i-i don't really do dances. How come I just had a really bad experience at one. What happened? Maybe she doesn't want to talk about it, ethan. No, I do. I mean, I don't, But I should if we're being honest with each other, right? Okay, so, at my old school There was a bunch of girls, I call them mean girls But they were so much worse than that. It felt like their sole purpose in life was just to pick on me. Anyway, so there was this end-of-the-year dance, And this guy danny asked me out. And I was shock. I mean, I had a huge crush on him. So my mom and I went shopping, And we found this dress, and it was Blue and gauzy and it just, It reminded me of water, of waves. And I went to the dance And went looking for danny. And I fod d him standing with those girls. And as soon as they saw me, they just... They all started to laugh. And one of the girls threw danny a hundred-dollar bill. Because apparently, the whole thing was just a dare. I felt so humiliated. And so I took all my mom's sleeping pills. Luckily, My mom found me in time, and, um,and we moved here. I am so sorry, rhonda. I've never told anybody that story before. Well, I'm glad you told us. Yeah, I am too. What.. Do you want? I need reservations downstairs for dinner tonight And they are completely booked unless you're a guest At the hotel, which I'm not, you are, And I wouldn't ask except it's valentine's day. Valentine's day... A holiday you once referred to as "the greeting card mafia's Stranglehold on the brainless and sentimental." Well, I know, but look.. I've never been in love before. You... in love? Yeah. and I want tonight to be perfect. It has to be perfect. And I know that here are no reasons for you To do any favors for me, and we are not exactly friends Or even frenemies for that matter, But we were friends at one point, and i... Look, when we were 12, I wrote a book report for you on the pearl And you said that you owed me one, and I never collected, And I want to collect now. please? Larry, hi, darling, it's naomi. Can you do me a favor? I have a friend Who needs a reservation for two tonight at 8:00. Oh, thank you. Ah! you're wonderful. bye now. Just make sure you preorder the molten chocolate cake. They cook it while you're eating. That's the best part of the meal. sounds good. Can I buy you a drink or something to thank you? So we should sit by the pool. There's a really nice view. Actually, it sometimes gets chilly out there Do you want to just sit at the bar? Sure. I'll be right with you guys. Thanks. Well, the view isn't bad here either, huh? Just don't mention we're in high school. Oh, okay. I am on it. So I said to my supervisor at the airline, "do not talk to me like that again, Or I will quit and take my skills elsewhere, I will." Hey, naomi. See, that's not fair. you knowy my name, But I don't know yours. Leo. so what can I get you two? I'll have a sparkling water. Trying to avoid the hard stuff Till I go back over the pond. I'll just have a chamomile tea, thanks. What was that? English accents always make people sound older. in what world? I can't stop now.

Wow, what a coincidence. Yeah. Wait, uh, adrianna, Um, I just wanted To apologize for what happened by the lockers yesterday. - It's fine.  - no, no, no, it's not fine. I was a jerk and I'm sorry. It's just, the guys were talking And nika was there, and... I didn't want to make her feel bad. But I ended up making you feel bad, which-- Which is the last thing I wanted to do. Look, it's a weird situation all around. Trust me, I get it. Right. Well, the next time anybody says Anything, okay, I'm gonna... Shut 'em down. navid-style, okay? - Yeah, and what exactly does that entail?  - I don't know. I'll let you know when I have that - Figured out.  - okay. Hopefully, I'll have it Worked out by the dance tonight. Well, no rush-- I'm not going. Sorry to bring up the dance. Now everything's even more awkward. No, it's, it's not. I'm really happy you met someone else. I really am. You're such a special guy. You deserve to have fun, and to go to dances And just... Just be normal. And normal is not really where I'm at right now. Um, ooh, make sure that you get nika the butter crunch truffles, 'cause there's really nothing like them In the entire world. - Truffles?  - she'll love them. All right. Okay. Have fun eating your chocolate. Happy valentine's day. Yeah, you, too. you know, right? that's what I thought. I mean, this is nice, but it's not "wow," And I'm really going for "wow," or anything better than "wow." Is there even a word that's better than "wow"? Here, wear these. Really? Mm-hmm. Oh, come here! thank you! Okay, hugging me over shoes-- Seriously, what has has gotten into you, silver? You're a completely diffenent person. It's the love, man. I'm telling you, it changes things. It's like I see the world as this whole better place. And, naomi, I never thought that I could feel like this. Well, I'm glad you found somnene who makes you this happy. Plus, it's been kind of cool us hanging out again. It has, hasn't it? So, okay, what are you going to do about hotty bartender? Oh... Oh, oh, okay, wait. You've got to ask him for a date tonight for valentine's day. Well, it's not like I have any other plans, but... Oh, well, no, his shift just ended. I think he said he was going home. What if you send him a bottle Of champagne with a note Telling him to meet you by the pool? Not bad. I like it. Exciting! exciting! exciting! - Front desk.  - larry. hi, sugar, it's me again. Listen, I need you to do me a little unusual favor. Is there any way you can have something delivered To one of your employee's homes? Bloody brilliant. Mymy dad was sitting in his armchair Drinking and yelling at the tv. He loved game shows. And the guy on the tv gets it wrong And my dad yells at the screen, "even a moron would know that!" And I call out, I said, "well, then you must be a moron 'cause you didn't know." So that's when my dad gets up Out of his chair and grabs me And he, um, he takes his cigarette And he... grounds it out right into my arm. So, when I need To know what pain feels like, I got a little reminder. Annie. Why don't you come up here. Tell us a story From your life. Something that matters. Okay. Um, well, there was this birthday thing that happened. This really awful girl--naomi, went behind my back, and... Annie, Go deeper. something really painful. Something that might Be hard to say out loud. Okay. deeper. Um, well... At my old school There were these girls. It felt like Their sole purpose in life was to make me miserable. Well, one day this guy danny Who I had a huge crush on, Asked me to the dance. So, my mom and I went shopping, And I bought this. blue dress. And the way that it flowed down to the floor... It was like water. I thought, you know, that it was going To be the best day of my life. Only, when I got there, Danny was standing... With those girls, And as soon as they saw me, They started to laugh. One of the girls actually Threw danny a hundred-dollar bill, Because it was just A dare. Oh, god, I don't know What I was thinking, Except that That I wanted to stop thinking. So... I took these sleeping pills From my mom's medicine cabinet, And I swallowed them-- all. 'cause I just want the pain to end. Thank you. I knew you had it in you. Thank you. Ethan, ethan, stop. - Please!  -Rhonda told us that in confidence - Because she trusted us.  - and I didn't say that it was her. No kidding! you said it was you! How could you use something like that as material? I panicked. okay, I panicked, Because he said, "go deeper, go deeper," And then I thought of her story. It wasn't a story. It's her life. - I know. - You don't. Otherwise you never would have done that. I can't-- I can't even look at you. Wow! Yeah? I-I mean, what's better than wow?
