To find him. What did you say to Ryan? - About what? - About me. Not much. You shouldn't have said anything. I'm heading in your direction If you want a ride. How do you know where I'm heading? I don't. I don't like games. And I don't like people who play games. Oh, my god, Jason. Listen to me. Everything you have done Was just to set me up to ruin my birthday? Absolutely. Being your friend? I'm over it. I already beat you to it. Excuse me. My name's Sean. I'm the son of Harry Wilson and Tracy Clark. Hi. I'm Naomi. Your half-sister. Yes. Of course. Hello. Hi. Um, hi. I'm annie. I'm your half-sister as well, actually. How about that? You all are sisters? - God, no! - No, . Um, definitely not. Well, I guess the fight is over, Without bloodshed, So I guess that's a plus. Yeah, but who's G.I. Joe? Beats me. As long as he's not another one of her exes. I say screw etiquette. Let's dig in. No! We're waiting for Annie. I'm positively starved! Eat a pig in a blanket. What does she mean by that? Is that some sort of Kansas-style vulgarity? Tabitha, I was not insulting you. Why don't you eat a pig in a blanket? How about that? That lady... Oh, the stories I could tell you. This is my dad. Harry Wilson? Yep. Sean Cavanaugh. I believe that I'm your son. My... my son? Yes, sir. Roman coins would melt with envy. What a profile! Oh. well, thanks. It's similar to yours, Harry. Definitely a Wilson Nose, But a little less, how would you say...? "Schnozzy." Dad's not schnozzy. I don't mean it in a bad way. Well, I'd be proud to have a Wilson nose. A Wilson nose. It really does kind of look like dad's, Doesn't it? Go on-- before you turned your head, You were telling us about how you enlisted. Are you one of those patriotic Americans - I hear so much about? - Right. well, Service to my country is very important to me. But the military is also an opportunity. You know, a college scholarship, A chance to see the world. Not that sadr city and Basra Were my first choices but, hey, You take what you can get. How is it to be over there? It's crazy. That's for sure. But it's all right. You know, in some ways, It's less crazy than where I came from. What do you mean? Aw, nothing. nothing. I just... I didn't Exactly have the most stable upbringing. I certainly didn't grow up in a place like this. So where did you grow up? South Carolina. That's where I was when I was on leave When a private investigator showed up, Told me my birth parents were looking for me. I gotta tell you, I couldn't believe it. But then I figured, if not now, when? You know, I've got to ship out in the next few weeks, And, well, you never know. I might not ever have another chance to meet y'all. Where's everybody hiding? My son! Tracy Clark? Mom! Look at us, We're just one big happy family now. Isn't it great? I hope Sean is okay at the Clarks'. Yeah, right. I don't want to talk about it. Hon, did you want Sean to stay here? Because I'm sorry I didn't invite him. I just figured - It was your call. - No, no. that's okay. It would have been weird. More weird potentially. Are you going to call him tomorrow? I... what do you guys think? Annie? Yeah. I'm fine with Sean. It's cool with me. I'll tell you how I feel. Old. Now I have to reconfigure all my math. Dixon, if I want to be 54, How old do I have to say I was when I had your father Now that he has a 25-year-old son He conceived when he was 18? Eleven. Hmm. That's a little unseemly. What about you, sweetie? How do you feel? You know, Harry, i... I don't think this has anything to do with me. Sean is your son. How do you feel? I feel... I feel like I have a son, And I haven't been any sort of father to him. Maybe he could tell people he's only 20. That would help me. Hey, girlfriend? Yes, boyfriend? Nothing,nothing. I just... I just like saying that. I like hearing it. Naomi. No. it's Ethan. No. Naomi's right there. So? So I wish she wasn't. I wish she would transfer to Uzbekistan. Or opt for home schooling. Or spontaneously combust. All right. Take it easy. She ruined my birthday party, And tried to break us up. But she didn't. We're together, Annie. We're so together we're like siamese twins, Except only of different genders and not related, And we're sexually attracted to each other. What's up, Ms. gameplayer? Well, Ozzie. Fancy meeting you here. Well, that must feel strange. You okay? Better than okay. Okay. 'Cause if you weren't, And you want to talk or anything... No. That's... that's really sweet of you. I have to say, it'll be a cold day in Tijuana Before I'd ever ask you for anything. And that's your cue to leave. Right. Of course. Annie.Hey. I just checked in with your dad. He said you had kind of a big weekend. So how about we talk in my office? You know, that's okay. thanks anyway. I really don't feel like talking about anything. I was kind of trying to make you feel like you had a choice. You don't. How about we talk in my office? Delightful. So how is the thing? How is the new brother? I was expecting a full debriefing last night. That what you're calling it-- debriefing? That's funny. I always took you for a boxers kind of guy. Yeah. well, it was all pretty exhausting, So I just hit the hay, you know? I mean, he seems nice, And my dad wants to get him some normal. - So I guess that's nice. - That sounds nice. -That's nice. - Yeah. Boring. I want to see something de-creepy. A change in the family dynamics It can effect a lot of things. It is normal. I just wanted to check with you, Make sure you guys are talking, And finding a way to adjust to the new situation. The way I see this, it's a great opportunity For the two of you to maybe help each other through this. Grow closer because of it. Would either of you like to say anything? Uh, well, just that Annie's a whore Who went out with my boyfriend behind my back - Your ex.  -After I asked her not to. Oh, 'cause that really justifies You ruining my birthday party And trying to sleep with Jason. Oh, my god, I wouldn't try Unless if he was the last man on earth... Okay, okay. Okay, girls, uh, that's enough of that. Look, ladies, I just don't want you To waste your lives worrying and fighting about guys. I mean, don't get me wrong. Guys are good, guys are great, But as you get older, you start to see That having good girlfriends is what helps you survive. God, if I could go back And tell myself this, I would. Girlfriends are so important. Uh, girlfriends are like plants. Yes, and guys Are like cut flowers. You know, sure, they're pretty And, uh, they smell nice, most of the time, But they don't last. Yes, and a plant, or a friend, If you nurture it and take care of it, It grows and it lasts a long, long time. Does this make sense? Does... is this helping at all? Are you doing a live blog about lunch? Yes. I am just keeping my public Up to speed on what's going down. Ugh, I'm thinking that cafeteria fish tacos Was a questionable choice. Who'd a thought? Oh, check her out. Are those ugg boots she's wearing? I'm sorry, did I just travel back to 2002? Oh, that is so going in. Since when did you Start caring about fashion? So, where is the queen bee gonna sit Now that the kingjock is no longer her main drone? The jocks' table? Okay, that's no longer an option. The mathletes. Uh, that would be puzzling. Or, perhaps she'll join the drama kids And do her best to act human. Burn. Glad I'm your friend. The blendeds? Bold move, Naomi. But that hive doesn't always play nice with intruders. Sometimes they get stung. By all means, have a seat. Thank you. Yeah, um, we don't let sophomores sit with us. I'm not your ordinary sophomore. Well, you do accessorize well. And I like the hair-- it's very julie christie. Julie christie is my godmother. We know, tasha. I suppose you can hang with us for a while. But we don't eat that garbage. Yeah, we always have a blended, one at lunch And one after school. - Cool with me. - Cool, so, Uh, you wouldn't mind getting them for us? Unless that's a problem. No, no. not a problem at all. Great. Oh, and do you think you could program my new sidekick for me? I just got it, and I'm totally tech-challenged. Well, fortun I speak fluent sidekick. Come on, guys, full speed! There's a big game tomorrow. Hey, Sean, thanks for coming down. Well, thanks for inviting me. You know, it's interesting. We, uh, we didn't play a lot of lacrosse In south carolina, I'll tell you that. Or in sadr city, for that matter. - Sean... - Yeah? 25 years,that's a long time. And... I don't know that I can ever... I don't know that I can possibly make that up to you. You didn't even know I existed. Just seems like you haven't had the easiest life, and... If I'd have known about you... I would have been there and I would have helped. That's nice. But... I turned out okay. Yeah, you did. Yeah, you did. Here I go, dad. Check it out, showtime. Whoo! Way to go, Dixon! whoo! Your dad say Mr. Matthews is coming back any time soon? He didn't say, and... Okay, I know that he's innocent And that that weird Kimberly girl was a cop and all, But, I'm sorry, the fact that they just assigned us lolita... Too on the nose. I know, right! Like, come on, you're asking for... I am so sorry, kansas. I didn't see you way down there. A tip for the short... Wear heels. I wouldn't know what to advise about the face. Okay, you know what? Well, take your time, honey. You can text me with a comeback. Look who's here-- the sophomore Let it go, annie, let it go. I programmed it, Customized it and downloaded The Estelle ringtone. perfect. So, tell me, ladies, How is this fairytale progressing? Am I done with my little tasks? Pretty much. just one more thing. You know the restaurant, the Desiderata? Oh. Ozzie Cardoza's family's place? Damn, girl. You're hooked up. Well... I'm not your typical sophomore. Well, they claim to be totally booked, But um, since you're so connected... Yeah. Done. no problem. She's pretty good. Yeah, but, um... Where are our drinks? Oh... right on time. Thank you, penelope. She's really good. Yeah. Soy, ladies. Annie? No. No. do not engage the scary blonde chick. Do not engage her. stop. don't. don't. I have to. I have to, don't you go over there. And I'll be right back. don't do it. So, your housekeeper seems really nice. Is you dad doing her, too? Oh... um... Wow. Uno momento. Ooh, the virgin's getting vicious. Oh... Clearly, trying to be me is giving you a nervous breakdown. Oh, I do not want to be you. Oh. now, sure you do. Don't touch me! Hey, hey, hey, come on. Enjoy my sloppy seconds. That girl is such a spaz. What was that? What's happened to you? Ozzie? Um... Listen, I feel like we kind of started off on the wrong foot. I've been a real game player lately. I'm sorry. Look at you with your tail between your legs. All right, bonita. what do you need? Reservations for four at desiderata tonight? Sure. Really? That's it? Yeah. I gotta go, though. Gotta go tell my tia in tj to go buy herself a parka. Hey. Hi. you were incredible. That was amazing. Thanks. I cannot believe that you came. That's really sweet. Well, it was part of my new year's resolution To see more theater. I was doing pretty good until I saw the blue man group While I was taking cough medicine. Hideous nightmares for weeks. Well, the blue men are weird-- Very bald, very blue, so... Oh, it's all coming back to me. Yeah, that, and the fact that, um, You haven't returned any of my phone calls. Yeah, I'm sorry. it's just, this play is really intense And then I've been kind of busy, so... Do you want to have lunch? Lunch? yeah. I know you actresses like to stay skinny, But you gotta eat, right? Uh, well, I mean... I have matinees most days, so... Okay, how about tomorrow? Are you free tomorrow? Tomorrow? Yeah. tomorrow I'm free. Good. Oh, this is for you. Oh, thanks. Thank you. Didn't this come out of your office? Well! look who went and got herself a haircut. Your daughter turns 16 and it's time to shear the locks, huh? What's on your mind, tabitha? So... I hear harry's going to dinner With sean and tracy and you have chosen Not to join them? That's right. Are you upset about the return of the prodigal son? No, I'm not. Sean is harry's son, not mine. I'm trying to give harry space to do this. Did I ever tell you about jean-luc and the chihuahua? Jean-luc was a lover of mine. Marvelous man. Marvelous fingers. Long... Delicate... Sensitive... And double-jointed. Sounds like a wonderful relationship. Oh, it was. We could have enjoyed each other for years, Jean-luc and i. If it wasn't for his chihuahua. Ah, yes. the chihuahua. Monstrous creature. Giant eyes, giant ears, The body of a rat and the bark of a demon. But jean-luc adored the flea-bitten mongrel. Let it sleep on the bed. Oh... finally, one night I had enough. "the dog has got to go," I said. "the dog has got to go." And you know what happened? I couldn't begin to guess. The dog went. And so did jean-luc. What I hadn't realized was That his chihuahua was my chihuahua. What was important to him Should have been important to me. You should go to that dinner. Sean may be harry's son, but harry is your husband. He can't do this without you. O...kay. Isn't the whole point of a reservation Not having to wait? I'll go see what the holdup is. Excuse. Ozzie. hi. Is the table ready? What name is it under? Oh, you lowdown, dirty, rotten, game-playing... Oh, who? me? Yes, you. You promised me a table. Oh, no. that must have been my identical twin. No, you promised me a table and I need that table right... Right now. God, you are so sexy when you are having a panic attack. It's something about the way your cheeks flush. You know, I do have a table. It happens to be the best table In the house, as a matter of fact. Well, then, give me the table. Okay. You can have it, but you're gonna owe me. Owe you what? Do you want the table or not? Fine. whatever. okay. I owe you. Good. right this way. Come on. Finally. Apparently it's the best table in the house. I want to thank the pep club for the spirit dinner.

It's water shiatsu. Watsu. But speaking of sushi, Lunch tomomorrow, r-23? We've already been to katsuya, matsuhisa And nobu... I've been eating a lot of raw fish.

I mean, that's what you have to offer him? Sean, you should come stay with us for a while. Really? Yeah, absolutely. We're your family, too. I mean, we're not fancy. We can't offer you tuna sashimi, But I make a mean Tuna casserole. Sounds good. And, hey, I've seen where you live. It seems plenty fancy to me. Oh, that's his mother's money, not his.

Um, let's just say your going to need two hairdo's For that outfit. God, why do I suddenly hate all of my clothes? Aw, your face-- It was priceless. You were just like... Wait, have you ever seen the De kooning painting, woman? No. Because your face looked exactly like it. Um, it was all... Hey, um... Have I changed? Yes, like 17 times. No, I mean... I mean in... the larger sense. I've been calling naomi bad, bad names And I've been dissing her clothes. I've been shoving her. I kind of like the wild child side of you. Oh, come on. You're not acting any worse than she is. No, um... but I'm not acting any better either. I swear, this is not me. Okay. So who are you? I used to a be nice person. I was a little geeky. I didn't... I didn't used to care so much About what clothes I wore. Especially to a lacrosse game. I didn't give a crap what people thought about me. I want to be that person again. Nobody's stopping you. That is very true. All right, guys, come on bring it in. Last time we played them, their middies were slow. Ethan, with your wheels, you should get a lot of looks. Dixon, I want you to hit him at the top of the triangle. Hey, dad, you know what I was thinking... Go, wildcats! Hey, sean, you made it. Never too late to learn the game.

Honestly, I haven't called anybody back. No, that's fine. I get it. It's just, I was getting kind of used To having you around again. It's fun hanging out with you. Yeah, but things are different now. You know, people grow up, the move on, They live their own lives. It's not like we're in high school anymore. Right. What does that mean exactly? I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, Honestly, it's the last thing I want to do, but... What do we have in common anymore? It kind of sounds like you're breaking up with me. No, I just... I don't want to fight over dylan or ryan Or whoever. You know, I'm over all of that drama. It's just that we have so much history. I guess I just figured... Yeah, I guess I don't see history As a good enough reason to keep going on this way. Especially when we haven't learned anything From that history. You know what, I'm kind of hungry. I'm going to order. You can go live your life. Hey, surprise, surprise. What are you gals doing here? I'm sure I'll be asking myself the same thing 20 minutes from now. You kidding me? There's nothing I like more than a sporting event. I got a book I got an ipod, I even have a rubik's cube. Yeah, of course you do. And a friend here, largely against her will. And that. Hey, I'm here. I'm being a good girlfriend. Yeah, speaking of good girlfriends, Do you guys know if annie's going to show up? Yeah, I think, um... Oh, my god, that hot dog smells so disgusting. I think... Oh, and then there's that. she's probably going to make an appearance later So I'm going to go deal with that Hey, naomi. How was dinner? Uh, well, I suppose it was palatable enough. I give it three and quarter stars. I just can't win with you. Oh, wait, yes, I can. You owe me. What do you want? I want a kiss. Fine. That was generous, But I didn't mean me. I want you to kiss walter the wildcat. What?! Really? Is it fun for you? ah... yeah. Great, okay, fine.Excuse me while I go kiss a mangy stuffed cat To satisfy your furry fetish. Could you stop moving for one second? What...? Oh, my god, it's you? You're a freak. - Oh, you're pathetic.  - oh, whatever. Annie, what the...? Hey, so how's it going with naomi? Yeah, well, I don't know. I'm not quite sure how to nurture This particular plant. I hear you. Oh, excuse me. Hello.  Yes.  Oh,my God Okay, I'll be right there. Come on, dixon, what are you doing?

Let's regroup, all right? Dixon...You need to clean up your act. We got these guys on skill, All right? no need to panic. We got these guys on skill, dixon. let's go. All right, everybody back out on the field, let's go. Come on, dix. Hey! dix, what's the matter with you?! Oh, come on. Dave, come on. You're in for dixon. Dixon, you're out! Hey, the way you're playing is unacceptable. Screw you, man. - What'd you say?  - screw... you. What was that out there? You've got to learn to control your anger. When we're on the field together, I'm your coach, not your dad. No kidding. You've been so busy being sean's dad. - Sean?  - Yeah, sean... your real son. I'm sorry. I thought that you were okay with him. Just ever since he's been here, it's been a 24/7 seanfest. You take him to practice, you ditched the spirit dinner. Can't let that guy Out of your sight. I guess... It was so sudden, him showing up here. I...I got blindsided And didn't know how to handle it. I'm sorry. You are my son, And genes, biology, none of that stuff matters. What do you mean, it doesn't matter? Of course it matters. No, it doesn't. Yeah? then why have you been acting the way you do?! Why does this even matter?! Why do you even care?! Without your genes, sean is just a total stranger. It does matter. Like, who you are, who you're related to. It matters... to me. Like, when you're with sean, It makes you feel connected to who you are, right? Well, I want that for myself. Who I am is black. When we adopted you, people kept asking questions, Very well-meant. how's he gonna know where he's from? how are you gonna teach him about his heritage? How are you gonna teach him how to shave his black hair? You know what I told those people? i don't know. But when the time comes, we will figure it out. Maybe the time has come to figure it out. The ball! get the ball! Get him! Hey, good job. That was hot. Hey, you big athletic manly sports stud! Thank you, thank you. Did you watch the game? I was mostly rubik's cubing. Um, who, who is that? You know, just a cheerleader. Uh, anyway, you know, I'm glad you came. Maybe next year you'll actually watch me play. Oh, so you think We're gonna be together next year. Why not? Why not? Oh, my god, you actually won! I can't believe it! And I can't believe that you were walter the wildcat. You have some zany moves. Well, Jared actually got concussed at the spirit dinner, And I thought I'd take his place. Why not? Look, I'm not naomi. I'm not bitchy and slick. I don't read w magazine and I really have no idea How many kids brad and angelina have right now. I'm not mean and I'm not cool. But this... this is me. I like this you. - Yeah?  - yeah. Especially your tail! So, uh, what was the deal with you and the creepy mascot? Oh, that was... Really bizarre? Look, you wanted a table at desiderata, I got the table, okay? In order to get that table, I had to kiss the mascot. I did what I had to do. You kissed the masscut for a table? Hardcore. I like it. I think this could be the beginning Of a beautiful friendship. Friendship of the beautiful. Hey, uh, sean. Hey, uh, listen, I'm sorry if me being here Has been kind of a drag, you know? It's selfish of me just to show up like this. Ah, no, man, you're cool, for real. No, no, it was selfish. Yeah, my father, adopted father, He, uh, he just passed away. For real, man? I'm sorry. Yeah, well, he was kind of jerk, my dad. You know, he spent more time playing video poker Than he did trying to raise me. I guess all I'm saying is you're lucky. I know. Anyway, I'm sorry. Congrats on the game, huh? I'll see you around. Hey, uh, you're not gonna go out with us? I mean, we're all going to celebrate. Uh, I think I've overstayed my welcome. Nah, man, my dad wants you here. I mean, we all want you here. Really? Yeah, really. - Come on, man.  - all right. Well, according to your emergency contact list, We're still bffs. Well, if they called you, I'm sorry. Don't be. I was worried about you. What happened? I fell off the stage in a blackout. It's a cursed play, And you're never actually supposed to say its name. It's an old superstition. And I accidentally said it, And then I didn't do the stupid ritual That you're supposed to say when you do say it, And so here I am. You know, I heard it was the same situation for the cast Of saved by the bell? I can't believe that you still came here After everything that I said. I came because we're friends, no matter what you say. And our history means something to me Whether you want to acknowledge it or not. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry about everything that I said. Don't be. you were being honest. No, I wasn't. I was actually avoiding being honest. What do you mean? I was trying to push you away. Why? Because I slept with ryan. Thanks, y'all. No problem, man. I always wanted longer arms. All right. all right, man Good night. good night, honey. Hey. hey, night, bud. Good night, mom. Good night.
