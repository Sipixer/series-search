Why does this suddenly feel like a double-date? I can help you deal with this but you've got to let me. Your department made quite the scene today. We did this now because then they'll figure the bust already happened. Harry,can I talk to you for a second? - Sure. - It's about our son. Whoa,whoa,tracy. I need you to tell them that the drugs were yours. Okay. If she confesses it should help. But you know there's no guarantees. Adrianna is going to be here. If you just give her a few more minutes. I cannot believe you did this to me. We're done,I hope you got that. You're dead to me. Well,you and tracy certainly made an attractive homecoming king and queen. It's funny how you look older and she looks just the same. Hmm,maybe I should pay a visit to "dr.Make-it-tight." Yeah,believe me that's the nicest thing I've thought since she kissed you. Well,I-I appreciate your holding back. At least in public. Yeah,yeah,you're the principal so I'm like a politician's wife and she's the head of the parent board so I have to be nice. But I don't like her. I don't blame you,but thank you. All right,the speed limit unless otherwise posted in residential areas is. 25 miles per hour,come on. Give me another one. All right,uh,parallel parking on a level street? 18 inches. Uphill? Turn your wheels away from the curb. Damn. Looks like somebody is ready to get her driver's permit. Yeah. Yeah,and if you pass your test tomorrow you can drive your mother and i to the homecoming dance. Aw,come on,for real? You guys are really chaperoning? Yes,we are chaperoning. You're taking silver,right? Yes,sir,asking her today. I got it all planned out already,you know? Got the suit,the shoes,restaurant. You know,how you taught me. Yeah,yeah. How about you,honey? You going to go to the dance? Um,yeah,I would have to be asked first. Running out of time. Thank you,thank you for that. Of course ethan will ask you. He's not going to homecoming with naomi. - And you did share a - What did you call it? An "almost" kiss. Ah,yes,well,when the "almost" wedding is, just let me know 'cause I'll buy you an "almost" gift. Shut up! And look,there he is now. Why don't you just ask him yourself? Not with her looking right at me. So,want to go to homecoming? No. Really? Why? Because it's everything wrong with this place in stark relief. It's like a big popularity contest set to music. You don't want to go,do you? Oh,nah,nah,no,no,no. - I don't like that crap. - Yeah. I thought it was,you know,stuff girls like. Um,other girls,maybe. So,I mean we could go,you uknow, and make fun of people if that's what you want. Well,I am actually scheduled to get my wisdom teeth out tomorrow, so maybe you could come over and make fun of me? I'm going to have a big chipmunk face. Sounds kind of kinky,but,uh,maybe that's your way of, uh,asking m to take care of you. No,this is. Really? You're here a week and those are the people you want to be friends with? Are you jealous? Do you want to be my friend? No,I don'T. So,are you going to homecoming,teacher? I'll be there as a chaperone. And what are you going to wear?Something sexy? You know what,kimberly,you're crossing the line. Knock it off. Aw,did I hurt your feelings? Just get to class. Just brushing up on my rare road signs. I'm taking my permit test. Well,if you need any lessons I could probably help you out. People tell me I'm an excellent driver. Oh,people tell you that,do they? Yeah,I mean,it's a little embarrassing,all the acclaim,but,uh,I got the skills. You've got something. So,anyway,uh,I wanted to tell you that I would like to invite you to homecoming. Okay. But I'm not going to. Okay,um,are you going to take naomi? No,no,we were going to go together,um,but we're broken up now, so,which is good,um,but it just feels like a little soon. Not to be going out with you. I mean to be going to homecoming with you. Does that make any sense? Oddly,that all made sense,yes. But,uh,just 'cause we're not going together doesn't mean that we can't dance together at the dance. Yes,well,if we're going to do that then that would be the place to do it. Okay,okay,so here's the plan. You show up,then I show up. Then it'll be total surprise,like,"oh,my god,you're here? Oh,my god,I'm here too." Then. we dance? So,I'll see you at homecoming. I-I will be there. I am not your date,though. Oh,no,no,no,no,you are not my date. Well,adrianna's mom contacted us first. And what did she have to say? That I'm the druggy and I'm bringing her poor little girl down, and,oh,adrianna's so fragile she can barely talk about it? Adrianna almost died. - What? - Oh,no. Of a drug overdose. Not always about you,is it,naomi? -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- sync: »ð¼ý¼ý</font> 90210 Season1 Episode08</font> Well,is she okay? What happened? Emt's resuscitated her,they took her to the hospital and pumped her stomach. Is she going to be all right? Yeah,she's going to be fine,but she was lucky. And since it's her first offense she's going to court-ordered rehab. As for you,when the police took her statement, she said that the drugs you flushed were hers. And since it's your first offense,you're not going to be expelled. So will naomi be facing any drug charges? The police said we could handle it here. The school board has suggested afternoon detention for the rest of the semester for lying about the drugs. How does that sound to you? Take it and run,naomi. Thank you. I'm not going in there. It'll be okay. You'll be okay. Don't say that. You don't know that. Baby! You are at one of the most famous rehabs in the world. I don't know what we're doing here. We can't afford this. Yes,we can. Bill is a great lawyer. He said he was able to pull some strings and he got you in gratis. Isn't that great? I mean,I just,I don't want you to worry about that. I just want you to focus on getting better. Mom,please don't leave me here. You're going to feel better. I,I just want you to get better,okay? Will you do that for me? Doing some redecorating? Just getting rid of some trash. You okay? Great! My best friend almost let me get kicked out of school before she od'D. My boyfriend isn't my boyfriend anymore. My parents are getting divorced. It's been a fun month. If there's anything that I can do,I mean, I really don't know what to say,but. thank you. You know,you've only ever been really nice to me. I don't think I've ever appreciated it. Anytime. You know what? A bunch of the girls are coming over to my place to get ready before homecoming. Going to go as a group. You want to come? You're probably going with somebody else. Well,um,no. No? Great,then you can come with us. It'll be so much fun,I promise. You know what? That-that does sound like fun. Good. Thanks. With naomi? You've got to be kidding me. I'm serious. It was really nice of her. And I felt bad,I couldn't say no. I-I think it'll be fun. Okay. What? No,it's just weird. You guys hanging out. Oh,don't be jealous. Oh,yeah,that's what I am. I'm still going to dance with you. Oh,I know you're still going to dance with me. Cause you know,dancing's like,my thing. Oh,oh,is it? Dancing's your thing. I thought driving was your thing. You know,I got a lot of things. I'm a very well-rounded individual,so. all right. Ok,I got to go. Mom's here. Uh,yeah,me too. Uh,got to go find a new thing,so. Hi,I'm naomi clarke. Sign in,please. What'd you do to get in here? You sleep with a teacher? No,I turned them all down. Oh,what,they didn't pay enough? Not nearly. What's your deal? You know,I saw your big poster out there in the hallway. I take it you're probably going to go to homecoming with one of the other big posters. You know,you one-dimensional creatures usually stick together. It's a good thing. I'm ozzie,by the way. Oh,see now,that's your first mistake. Because now that I know who you are, it's going to sting so much more when I never talk to you again. Nice.Mexican nanny? Honduran. Hello. No talking. Okay,remember to fasten your seat belt,make sure your mirrors. adjust my mirrors,both: .And your parking brake is off. - And? - I got it. And,and,don't play the radio too loud, don't drive when tired and don't get distracted by the other kids in the car. So did ethan finally ask you to homecoming? Way to slip that one in. Um,kind of. We're going to hang when we get there, but we're not actually going together. Annie. I just distracted you. Oh,well,that was sneaky. That's my point. Okay,onward. Now,always remember your license and you're insurance card. We're with state farm. If you ever get pulled over. I won'T. You never know.The insurance card is right here in the glove box. Got it. Thanks. Now,can we talk about what kind of car you're going to get me? Can we talk about what kind of job you're going to get? Right. Adrianna,you have a visitor. I do? Navid? What are you doing here? I'm actually here to do a story for the blaze news. Let you tell your side of the story. Inside the walls of currents-- it's A. it's a privilege. That's one weird way of looking at it. Give me your phone. What? They don't let us have our own. They let us use the pay phone once a day. It's kind of like prison in 1970. Wait,you're not texting any lowlifes are you? 'Cause I really can't have. I'm texting naomi. I left her like 15 messages before I came here. Hey,well,look,I got you some really great reading material. Check it out. So how are you doing in here? I'm not doing your stupid story,so you can just get the hell out of here. Hey,hold on. Listen,if you. if you ever want to talk,you know. off the record. just give me a call,okay? SO WILL U COME SEE ME? I MISS U  I NEED U  A Message Deleted ********** I'm thinking. I don't want to talk to you. I was thinking that you are not my friend. I'm thinking I want to talk to my real friend,naomi. That's good. You're claiming responsibility. Claiming responsibility,yeah. So what? Obviously it was my fault. I don't want to miss her. She was trying to help me,and then I hurt her. So badly,so deeply that she's never going to forgive me. And I can't live with myself knowing that I did something that awful. All you can do right now is be here. This is the last place I want to be. Do your ears hang low? Do they wobble to and fro? Can you tie 'em in A. you know what? What? It is easy to get your wisdom teeth out. I loved it. Yeah. It was pretty fun for me,too. Except you've been singing that song for the last half hour. It's like a perfect song. It's my favorite song. Yeah,okay. Well,um,you stay here. I'm going to go get you some water,all right? The doctor said take two more of these in three hours, but I think I might have to cut the doses in half, because you seem pretty responsive to the medication. Thank you so much. I'm just. So happy right now. Aren't you so happy? Pretty happy. But probably not as happy as you are. I'm so glad we both hate homecoming. This is so much better. I'm gonna lie down. Okay. Take. Guess not. Hello. Hey. - How'd it go? - I got my permit. I got 100% on the test. And in a few weeks when I turn 16. I don't even want to think about it. I'll be cruising down sunset. See,now that's where I got in my first accident. Me and a bunch of my buddies were. screwing around in the car and got distracted? Something like that. Yeah,see,I know not to do that. That's because women are better drivers. Not true. Here,you can learn a few things,dad. It's never too late. Don't you have a dance to get ready for? Congratulations. Thank you. Thanks for calling. It was nice to hear from you. So what's up? There's some country western singer that's supposed to be some big deal-- she was snoring so loudly last night,I couldn't sleep. I figured you could use that for your story. That's pretty good,but I'm not actually doing that story anymore. Just wanted to check up on you. And I figured since I was coming,I'd bring you some supplies. Not the kind I'm dreaming about,I bet. I brought you some scratch paper,some colored pencils. I don't know if you draw,but I figured everybody likes to doodle,so. and,uh,oh yeah,this is going to be awesome right here. oh,yeah,uh. got you a little gift box with shampoo-- lavender extract,conditioner and toner, which I honestly don't know what that is,but my mom suggested it. Oh,one more thing-- I got you a couple dvds. Do they let you watch dvds? Yeah,as long as we don't sprinkle coke on our popcorn. It's all good. Great. Uh,well,enjoy then. Navid. I need you to do something for me. Yeah,uh,what's that? Bring naomi here,okay? Get her to talk to me. I... well,I can ask her,but I don't know if I can make her. please. Please,can you bring her here? Will you do that for me? I need to apologize. It's killing me. I have someone's thumb stuck in my ass. Oh,ll,you'd certainly know what that feels like,wouldn't you,nina? Ew,gross! Forgive us.We don't exactly censor here. No,it's fun. Like sisters. Oh,yeah,not my sister. I would beg to get to go out with her girlfriends. She'd be like,"oh,yeah,go get ready." I'd run upstairs,do my hair and makeup,you know,get all dolled up. Come downstairs,she's gone. Thanks,sis. Whatever. I always wanted a brother instead. Yeah,me,too. I didn't get mine until I was eight,but it was worth the wait. We fight,but he's probably my best friend. That's cool. I always thought an older brother would,you know, look out for me,kick anybody's ass who messed with me, that sort of thing. All right,look. Ah,oh,wow. You look gorgeous! You are going to get some action tonight,girl. Big smile. Too bad adrianna's not here. Can I see that before you put another picture of me with my eyes closed on your facebook page? Annie,shoes time. I'm gonna wear these,I think. These will look great for you. Really? But they look so expensive. Oh,whatever.They're just shoes. Um,naomi,can I ask you something? Yeah,of course.What's up? Is it weird that you're not going to homecoming with ethan? Ethan and I broke up. It'd be weird if I was going with him. Well,I know,but. look,we've broken up so many times so many times afterwards I've just wanted him to be miserable,you know? This time's different. I just want him to be happy. And I want to be happy,too. is everybody decent? Ask nina. Oh,yeah,I am. Well,naomi,you have a gentleman caller. What?Who? Come on in! Thank you. Sure. Hey,uh,can I talk to you for a minute? Ah,baby,you awake? No,I'm asleep. But I'm talking to you. My mouth feels so frickin' bad. When was I supposed to take another pirate? A what? A pill. What did I say? ****** ********* But,uh,you were supposed to take another pill. uh,about an hour ago,but you were asleep. You should have woken me up! Now it's gonna take an hour for this one to kick in. Sweetheart,which one? Well,the green one goes better with what I'm wearing, and I want to remind tracy that we go together just in case she gets confused. Don't worry. I won't be confused. Well,I'm sure as hell confused. Why don't you say something to her? To who? To tracy. Good lord,debby,I didn't know kansas women had no cojones. I've got it,tabitha. That woman kissed your husband. Yes,and my husband and I have dealt with it,and it's over. I understand what happened. What else would you do in wichita,bake her a cake? This is beverly hills,sweetheart. You really shouldn't be drinking,tabitha. It's kool-aid. Look,I could squash you with an eye roll,but you could take on tracy. When it comes class,brains and beauty,my dear,she's no match for you. Tabitha,I think that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. Oh,that's okay. I won't remember it in the morning. Hey,can I have you guys fill our your ballots for king and queen,please and thank you? Boy,life is full of irony,isn't it? Come on. Let's get closer to the band. This band is so great. Oh,my god,they play at the viper room all the time. It's so amazing that you guys get such cool bands to play at your school dances. I mean,in kansas,it was usually three stoners playing for munchie money. Oh,god,that's so sad! Excuse me. No excuse. Oh,hey,rude. You look cute. Keep in mind,less isn't always more. Guys like it when you leave a little to the imagination. Thank you. Okay,who was that? That was my detention buddy. He's a smart-ass. With a hot ass. that sounds like something I would say. I'm gonna go get us some fruity,non-alcoholic crappy drinks. Where is she? Uh,she's not feeling very well. She had a really bad migraine. She said she might not even make it to the homecoming. You're a terrible liar,navid. I know she's gonna be there. She doesn't want to talk to me,does she? Hey,I'm here. I'll talk. Right. Looks like I'll have to take care of this myself. hello. Silver,how are you feeling? I'm good,I think. It's all a bit of a blur. For some reason,I'm wearing a leather jacket over my pajamas. is dixon taking good care of you,though? Apparently. Yeah,well,he must be really into you,girl, 'cause he really wanted to come to this dance. He did? Yeah,he really loves this stuff. Anyway. feel better. Bye. Oh,my god,you're here! Oh,my god,you're here,too,and so am I! See?I told you that'd work. Yeah,there' still part of the plan to be enacted. Are you saying you would like to dance with me? I would. So,my friend bet me 50 bucks that I couldn't get you to dance with me. I'll split it with you. I'll give you a hundred bucks to go away now. Come on.You're standing alone on the dance floor. Look around. Naomi clark can't be the girl with two cups. You better not touch my ass. So maybe I was being ridiculous. We should have just come together? Oh,no,it's okay. I had fun getting ready with naomi. Cool,so,uh,what do you think of my dance moves? Pretty sick,huh? Oh,yes,I am stunned by your one move. Oh,no,no,no,I have more than one move. So how much longer are you in detention,anyway? The rest of the semester. Damn,girl,you were bad. I was just in there for one day. Maybe I can get some more time if I go and steal your big face picture out in the hallway. Um,creepy. Tengo muchas esperanzas para nosotros. Despacio,muchacho. Vamos a tomarlo despacio. A pasty white girl who speaks fluent spanish. That's very sexy. So,ah,I'll get us some drinks. And I will get us snacks. Annie,can we talk? Sure. Oh,my god. Adrianna,hey. How are you? I've been bettertter. Looks like a pretty fun party. What are you doing here? The gave me a night pass so I could come to homecoming. It's not jail. They let you come and go. No,they don'T. You're a liar. You can't come and go out of rehab. Naomi,can we go talk? No,we can't talk because I'm not talking to you. - Why not? - Just go. No! No,I need you to tell me why,okay? I have tried apologizing to you. I have tried to tell you how sorry I am. Please,I need you to tell me why and. because it's too hard,adrianna. I can't take it anymore I can't keep trying to save you when you won't even try to save yourself. I think it's easier if we just stop being friends because I can't take it. I-I'm glad that you're okay. I really am,but I can't keep watching you do this to yourself. Not anymore. This better be good stuff because I know the difference. What do you got there,kimberly? Geez,man,am I the only damn kid in this school? Is there absolutely nobody else you can harass? Not at the moment,sorry. What are you doing with this,huh,kimberly? What the hell are you doing with this stuff? I guess I just get bored easily. Why do you care? Let's go. Where to? Just start walking. The private investigator should have some information for us. That's great. I have to get back to the party. Harry,you will never guess who I just ran into. Tracy. I'm so sorry I stole him away. We were talking about our son. We'll have to finish that later. I am so sorry. - She caught me in the hallway. - This has to stop. I am tired of smiling and pretending that everything is okay when it's not. I know,I know,but she is a piece of work,and I don't know what to do. I've been thinking,and her behavior makes me realize that I am right. About what? We need to tell the kids about your birth son sooner than later,harry. Okay,yeah. You're right. I mean,I haven't told them 'cause I,I don't want to hurt them. Yeah,well,it's gonna hurt a lot more if they hear it from someone else. How do we know she hasn't told people? Harry! Need you. Hey,can we finish this later? I have to take care of something. Yeah. Me,too. - Caught her buying drugs. - Okay. I will take these. And?I'll take care of it. - That's it? - And you can go now. No,I'm not going anywhere until you tell me exactly what is gonna happen. Okay,she comes into my class. ryan,I told you before to stay out of this. Yeah,and maybe that's why the problem's getting worse,harry. I got it covered. - Really?You have it covered? - Yeah. That's why there's dogs running around sniffing lockers at school? And you busted the wrong kid? And now you've got kids buying drugs at dances. Okay? Please keep your voice down. No,I'm not gonna keep my voice down,all right? I'm tired of this crap. You don't know how to deal with these kids, and you don't know how to protect them,and I'm going to the board, 'cause you don't know what you're doing,okay? And if they don't listen,I'm going to the L.A.Times. Oh,for god's sakes. I'm a cop,you dumbass. What? It's pretty intense. Welcome to my life. You don't think there's any way you could be friends with adrianna again? Just like I said,it's too much drama,you know? I just don't need that anymore. It's why I like you. You're so. boring? No,not at all. Stable. I really want to be your friend,annie. I know I haven't acted like it,but I do. I would really like that. It's just this one thing. Honestly. I don't think we can be friends if you're with ethan. Um,but you said at your house. I know. At my house,not here. Watching you,him,both of you dancing together. But you broke up with him. I know,and I can't stop him from dating other people. I know that,but it just can't be you. Not if we're gonna be friends. Friends tell each other everything,you know? And if you're with ethan, I'm not gonna want to hear about your first kiss or going out on dates with him,you know? These are things we're supposed to share together. It's just,I mean,how would it feel if I went out with your ex? It,it would be weird. Annie,boyfriends come and go,but friends stick together. Oh,do they? Through everything? That's different. No,it doesn't have to be. You don't know what it's like with adrianna. No,no,I-I don't,but if it hurts you this much to watch adrianna do this to herself, then what are you gonna do if you really lose her? What? Don't sleep through your opportunity to take a chipmunk to homecoming. For real? For real. I thought we hated homecoming? Uh,I'm on to you. Let's go. All right. Well,I gotta stop home and get my stuff,but. but don't be afraid to tell me stuff,okay? We don't have to agree on everything. Hey,come on now. Who said I was afraid? I was just being nice. Well,then don't be so nice. Okay,I. just shut up and kiss me. That hurt. We'll get some aspirin on the way. Tracy,I want to be very clear on something. Yes? Just because you're on the parents board and I'm the principal's wife. you know what,debbie? I actually was gonna go talk to some people over there, so would you mind just getting to the point? If you ever kiss my husband again or touch him or look at him in the wrong way, you and I will have a very big problem. Gosh,I don't know how I would get through the day knowing that you were angry at me. Let me define "big problem" just so we're clear. I will hit you in the face so hard I will knock your teeth out. You enjoy the rest of your evening,tracy. I know I will. Hey,eric. Hey,adrianna. How was your vacation? It was very relaxing. But I could get more relaxed. All right then. Get out! Get out,adrianna! Get out! - What the hell are you doing? - Get out! Don't you ever sell to her again,you lowlife piece of crap,you hear me? Control your woman,ade,or next time it's gonna get a lot worse. Navid,are you okay? Why are you doing this? What do you mean,why am I doing this? Because I want to,because it feels good. Why are you doing this? Are you blind? You're always doing this,"woe is me" crap and how you have no friends, and I'm sitting here right in front of you! What are you talking about? I like you,adrianna,okay? I like you! There I said it 'cause god knows you would have noticed. Stop. Stop it. No,I've liked you since middle school. When we were kids and we used to hang out making those stupid versions of big movies together? Don't do. normal stuff. I need you to stop. No,I'm not gonna stop,okay? I need you to stop. Hey,I can't stop. We used to be so close. Then you got in the seventh grade and you got that sitcom and it was like you don't even know me anymore. But I never forgot you. I never forgot who you used to be. Who I used to be. right. Do you remember when I agreed to do lord of the rings. so that you'd do a scene from princess diaries? Do you remember that? Yeah. I would always do anything for you. Oh,my god. Did you pay to get me into currents? Oh,my god. Yeah,I did. My dad did. I just,uh,had to get him to do it. Hey,hey,hey. I just want you to get better,okay? I want you to get back to who you used to be. All right? Adrianna. Oh,I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. I know,I know. I'm not gonna let you down,okay? I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I'm gonna make sure nothing does. I can't do this. Can't do what? I... I can't do "us" to naomi. I get where she's coming from,and I like her. Do you like me? What? Do you like me? Yeah,but. Look,look,obviously,uh,this needs to be kept a secret. This is very serious,very real. I hope I didn't screw anything up. You won't if you keep your mouth shut. You know you can stop the whole sassy act now,right? It's not an act. How old are you anyway? I'm 25-- why? -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-
