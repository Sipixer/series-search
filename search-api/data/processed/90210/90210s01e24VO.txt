He requested your records. He's looking at military schools. I'm in a bit of a pinch financially. I went through a lot of money very quickly. I'm glad to help. I got,like,20 cases of beer and topher's brother brought over vodka,gin,whisky,bourbon. thank you,phoebe abrams. I am really stoked about the afterprom party at phoebe abrams's house tonight. I will be there with the beverly hills police department. Who the hell told him? I know who it was. Why did you tell your dad about my party? Is that what everyone thinks? They don't think. They know. You're a rat. The sophomore prom queen is erin silver. I don't know exactly who I am. But I do know who I am not. Some weird zombie prom-loving loser. Why did you get me this corsage? You looked in my facebook page,didn't you? You like me. Dude,I'm so sick of looking at you. Mvid! Y water just broke. I think I'm going into labor. oh,I'm definitely getting some tonight. So,anyway,his dad left when he was a kid. It was just liam and his mom against the world. She was a housekeeper for this billionaire family out in long island. Whatever.Long story short. Last year,liam walked in on the billionaire screwing his mom. Oh,how awful. I know.Right? Then she marries the guy. Turns out he's a complete son of a bitch. I mean,no wonder liam has trust issues. Are you listening to me? Absolutely. Liam sounds great. You had me at trust issues. No,jen. You don't get it. Tonight,everything changed. Everything. Well,honey,that's great. Naomi! Total emergency. Not only has my party been ruined, thanks to principal loser, but now nobody's stepping up and they're. uh,and that's a good thing since after proms are highly illegal and will lead to suspension, which will lead to missing finals, which will lead to summer school. Did you fall on your head? What? Jen's not a grown-up. She's my sister. Jen,phoebe. Phoebe,jen. Hey. Um,jake manditsky said that he could have the party at his house, but then his parents said at the last second that they're not going to their beach house and now. Well,there's no parents at my house. I'll throw it. I don't think so. Sweetie,I'm sorry,but there's no way I'm going to have a bunch of high school kids trashing my house, spilling beer all over my furniture and vomit wine coolers on my rugs. It's actually my furniture and they're my rugs since I'm paying for everything. What's that supposed to mean? In fact,since I'm the only one paying rent, it's actually my house. If I feel like throwing a party at my house, I'm going to throw a party at my house. but you are more than welcome to come. You don't want to do this,naomi. So.let's do it! Afterprom party at my house. Spread the word. Party at 174 west hollybrook. Penelope! Party at my house tonight. Keep it on the D.L. Benedict annie is right there. Drop it,penelope. Annie's not the one who told. Don't worry about her or them. I like that wrap,by the way. You look really good tonight. I mean,like a model-- a really,really short model,like,a regular model standing in the distance-- but you look good. Well,thank you,naomi. Oh,my god. Everyone who's anyone is going to be at my party tonight. oh,my god. What? Ade just went into labor. Oh,my god. Oh,I have to get to the hospital. Yeah. Please,you have to take care of my house. You have to be the hostess. Make sure that nobody vomits wine coolers on the rugs,okay? Absolutely.Don't worry. Thank you so much. Okay,ggot toO. Go. Go,go,go. Oh,is this it? No,wait. Ours had different rims than this one. Man,is it just me,or do most limos look very similar? We'll find it. Eventually. Yo,congratulations,prom king. Thanks. Dixon,why do you have to be like that? You can be enjoying the fact that you won. Whatever. What does that mean? Nothing. It's just hard to enjoy something when your girlfriend thinks it's stupid. Guys,guys! Adrianna is having her baby. Now? Yeah. Navid is with her and naomi is going to meet her at the hospital. We've got to get to naomi's 'cae I promised that I would take care of her house,and there's, like,200 people on their way there now. We got to hurry,guys. All right,but the only problem is someone stole our limo. Navid and adrianna probablyook it. yeah Yo,duncan. Can we get a ride,man? Yeah,no problem,man. Hop aboard the white stallion. You are the man,D. Wait! She's coming? I don't want that rat in our limo. Phoebe,I swear I didn't tell anyone about your party,okay? I swear. Come on,pheebs,be a sport. They need a lift. Yeah,if you could just drive me to my house,I could get my car. It would be so great. Fine. Just don't talk to me or look at me. Honestly,phoebe? - You're talking and looking. Thank you. Sorry I have to abandon you. I mean,on prom night and everything. Don't worry about it. I'll see you later tonight. You'll go to the party? Well,it's your party. Of course I'm going. You know what's crazy? What's that? My mom has been sending me to this therapist for months now. This chick costs $200 an hour, and I've barely said five words to her. I spend one night with you, I end up telling you my whole life story. Well,500 bucks,we'll call it even. this probably goes without saying, but that stuff that I said-- that was private. Of course. Doctor-patient confidentiality. Cool. Come on,man. Move the car. Oh,finally. Oh,my lord! That is just crazy talk. - Excuse me? Yeah,I thought so. I told karen I thought so. Ma'am,this is pretty urgent. What's the matter,kid? You get in a fight on prom night? Well,I feel your pain,but it's not urgent,okay? So take a seat and I'll get to you when I get to you. Anyway. What? - She said I never said a word to her,which is ridiculous. 'cause I can remember the exact second I told her. Oh,my god,navid,what is taking so long? My girlfriend is having a baby! She's having a baby? Yes,she's having a baby. Yeah,I am having a baby. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-Proudly Presents -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-Sync: sunshine_zp 90210 Season 01 Episode 24 Beautiful dreamer,wake unto me starlight and dewdrops  whoa!

That's what they always say,right,man? Well,this one is a lot of work.

I grabbed a few brownies from the post-prom-a-looza, and we suspect that they contained cannabis. Now,see,that you should have whispered. What? The nerds had pot brownies. so,you two are high? Yes,we are! We are! And it,it,it couldn't be worse timing because we cannot drive to find the kids. Where would you drive exactly? I have no idea. okay. Everything is gonna be okay.

Are you kidding me naomi is your sister? Yes. She was getting a little full of herself. She needed to be knocked down a peg. Trust me: It's good for her. You used me. it's not like you didn't have fun,right? If I were you,I'd consider myself lucky. But she is your sister. I mean,she's gonna hate you. Oh,she'll never know it's me. I mean,you're not gonna tell her. Because she'd be devastated. And you're just not that cruel. Give me my shirt. I forgot how cute teenage boys are when they're upset. You are a bitch. Don't be vulgar. and yes,I am. Only when it's absolutely necessary. Annie! How could you? What? You slept with liam in my bed. No. W-what are you talking about? Don't lie to me. Naomi,I didn't do anything. What is this? It's my wrap. Which I found in my room. How did it get there? I don't know. I haven't even been in your room. Must have been somebody else. I was with phoebe abrams. Oh,right! She hates you! No. Look,I know she does. But she got so drunk so I had to drive. Stop lying to me! Stop it! Naomi,I wouldn't do that to you. What are you talking about? You already have! What? Ethan ring a bell? And I forgave you 'cause apparently I was an idiot! Okay.Naomi,please stop,okay? This is crazy. she acts like she's this innocent girl from kansas. That is not what she is! Maybe at one time. Not anymore. She ratted out the party. No,I didn't! No one wants you here. Why are you still here? Get out of my house,kansas skank! That's for charlie. get out! Get out! Screw. screw you,naomi! Screw all of you! Hi,um,I was calling.
