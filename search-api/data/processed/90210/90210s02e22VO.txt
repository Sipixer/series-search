- Nothing happened, - I lied. - How could you even ask if you could go to Australia? She doesn't know about the gambling - about the breaking into school. - Then you should tell me about it. - What the hell? - Is he stalking you? - We could be friends. - There's just too much that's happened. I got this for Ade. I'm gonna put it in her dressing room with a note on it that says, "Meet me on the roof." We're off to NY. Come out and see us there. You know how long he's been playing tennis? Since he was four. You wanna ruins that for him? Our relationship, it's too much for me, and this isn't working. - It was a mistake. - Totally idiotic. - About the tackle shop. - Just gonna take some time. - I could help speed things up. - We had to let Rosa go. - Why? - She stole some coins - from Jeffrey's collection. - Can I see you? I really need to talk. Can we talk later? I'm actually in bed. I think I have the flu. I could really use your advice. Who's Jay Boyd? Why did you act like you were hiding something? Jennifer Clark? - Dr. Boyd will see you now. - Surprise! There's your baby, Jen. Can you believe it? Not really. It's just Jen's hardly human. Who would have thought she could reproduce? What's the matter, Naomi? Are you disappointed that I'm pregnant? I bet you were hoping I was having a love affair with a coke-addled chimpanzee. Sorry, hon. Nothing that blackmail-worthy. I don't know. I'm not ruling out the whole chimp thing. What do you mean you don't validate? I don't have money for this. What am I supposed to do? Get a job. At 24 weeks, you'll be feeling some kicking.</i> Please. She's a regular David Beckham.</i> All right. Excellent... You'll need to see Dr. Boyd in two weeks.</i> So, are you going to tell your step-dad that you took the coins? If I do, he'll send me away. Or I don't know. Press criminal charges probably. My life, school, surfing, friends, all that would be over. I'd never see you again. Or, see anyone from West Bev. Maybe you can make this right. You could earn money and send it to your housekeeper, or you could help her find a new job or something. Maybe. I don't know. I just... I messed up, and I hurt someone. You're lucky. You've got options. Sometimes you mess up, and there's no way that you could ever fix it. - You were amazing. - No, you were amazing. We both were amazing. That was so amazing. What is all this stuff? Just gifts from my fans. Chocolate, stuffed animals. I don't know. Underwear. Some of this stuff is from the L.A. show. Really? This is not exactly my style. I think it's sweet. You keep it. Really? It's my gift to you. Can you help me put it on? What's up? You want to walk me to class? Sure. Want to go to this party thing? What, that thing? What is this? Actually, it's like a tradition. It's like the senior class passing the torch down to the junior class. The guys wear tuxes. The junior girls wear red. Senior girls wear white. Food, dancing. Should be fun. Right, because school-sanctioned dancing sounds like a real hoot. Get down. You know you have a bad attitude. I forgot to tell you. The water in Australia goes down the drain counterclockwise. I'm sorry. I think that's rad. - What? - We're going to Australia. I know. I'm so stoked. And, I got to tell you, I'm so glad we got over that stupid fight thing. I learned my lesson, as long as we're honest with each other, it's all good. Totally. Come on. Let's go. Peach Pit team S02E22 <i>Confessions</i> We all know the universe is expanding, but is it slowing down, or is it accelerating? I want you to partner up and start plotting the supernovae redshift data. And maybe we'll figure out what's going on with this universe of ours. Dude, Mr. Reiss is so high. It's like his mind supernova-ed from thinking about the universe too much. I have something I have to tell you. I can't not tell you. Remember that day that we broke up at Adrianna's concert? What, for, like, two minutes? I ended up kissing Silver. We were both sad and-and drunk, and I swear, from the bottom of my heart, it didn't mean anything. All right? I don't like her; she doesn't like me; but I can't keep a secret from you. I have to be honest. You know what? Dixon, you know what? Screw you. I don't need to play second fiddle to another girl anymore. - I've gone on that ride, I'm done. - You're not playing second fiddle. Yeah. Right. "Known for his scathing yet romantic depiction of frivolous upper-class Americans..." "... F. Scott Fitzgerald is considered unparalleled in the elegance and grace of his fiction." You recognize that? That's from my paper. That is from a paper that Ms. Genlow pulled off a Web site called Greatpapersforcheap.com. I'm sorry. What? I don't think you know what's going on here. With this infraction, you're going to get an F in English, and with that, you're not going to graduate this year. I don't think it's gonna be that bad. I feel fairly confident that you can talk to Ms. Genlow and convince her to look the other way. - Why would I do that? - Because otherwise, I'll tell the superintendent how you covered up the fact that your son broke into the school the night of the vandalism. I'll do it, too. Come on, people. Let's hustle! When is Obama gonna outlaw gym class? Guantanamo Bay, yeah, that's great. What about phys ed? Seriously. Am I right? What's going on? Why haven't you returned my calls? - How are you feeling? - Fine. I mean, fine. Considering I was pretty sick. It wasn't the flu, actually. It was food poisoning. Serves me right for eating the cafeteria sushi. Just stop. Stop lying. You weren't sick. I heard a car honking. You were driving, - you pretended you were in bed. - The sushi thing happened afterwards, - and I wasn't in bed per Se. - You know what? It's over. I don't want to be with you anymore. We never had much in common; you're self-centered; and you lied to me too many times. I forgave the Cannon thing, but I just needed to talk to you, and you pretended you had the flu. It's just too much. I'm done. Like you're so perfect. Like you always do the right thing. I don't. But this... you and me... we're done. So your singing career has really taken off, hasn't it, Adrianna? It's been amazing. I was recently signed by Laurel Cooper at Witgate Records, and it's been so great. Word has it that you just did a duet in New York with Javier. Yes, I did. It was crazy. And I think that all of West Bev is extremely proud of your accomplishments. So, you and Javier are dating. Am I right? Tell us what's it like to date someone so famous and successful. It's been good. He's a really sweet guy. We've just started to get to know each other, - but... - Cut. I'm sorry. We need to cut. This is The Blaze: Live Edition, Navid. We can't cut. We can if I say it. And the lighting looks weird. And I want to discuss wardrobe and I need to talk to Adrianna right now. Can you just please go? Navid, what's going on? Can I ask you a couple of my own personal questions? Like, for instance, - where did you get that bracelet? - It was a gift from Javier. From Javier? Javier gave me this bracelet. What? So Javier happens to know that your favorite flower is tulips. And Javier also knows that you love butterflies and that your favorite food is hamburgers, right? And there- the 11 and the six. Javier also coincidentally put those on there because he knows the first time - you and I kissed was on November 6. - November 6. This is from you? So much for The Blaze: Live Edition. What's going on? Looks to me like it's The Blaze: Live Edition. You can date Javier. You can fall deeply in love with him.</i> You can marry him and have a whole brood</i> of Javier Juniors with amazing abs. You can do that for the rest of your entire life. You can do all that. But you can't do it wearing my bracelet. - Who didn't turn off their camera? - Not I. My bad. Navid yells, I panic. Give it back, Ade. Can you give it back? Give me back my bracelet. I don't want to give it back, Navid. Leave us alone. - What do you mean? - I don't want to give it back. I didn't think you liked me, all right? I know I am a lot of drama, and I just didn't think</i> - <i>that you liked me.</i> - <i>I do.</i> I like you. But I know you're dating Javier, and he's famous and sexy</i> and famous and... I'm just Navid. I can't begin to compete with that. That's where you're wrong, Navid. No one can compete with you. I'm so happy for them. You okay? No, not at all. Liam just broke up with me. Sweetie, come here. The surface of this creme brulee, it isn't hard enough. Creme brulee, it's like a woman. It should seem impenetrable and then tap, tap... and you're in. Comprende? Can I talk to you? Tio, thank you. Is it true? Are you pregnant with my kid? Who... told you that? I saw a paternity test. How did you even...? How did you get my DNA? You left your gnarly hairbrush at my house. My God. So it's true. I'm gonna be a father. You know what? I'm not going to mess this up. I'm going to get my life back on track. I want to be there for my kid. I do. I don't make a lot of money, but I have some savings, and the good thing about my job is I get summers off, and... Basically, Jen, I want to do whatever I can to help raise this baby. Our baby. I don't need your help. Thank you very much. I'll he nannies and baby nurses for that kind of thing. But this is my baby too, Jen. I have rights. Which I will fight you for in court. Just give up, Ryan. My baby doesn't need a public schoolteacher as a father. Wait. If you will excuse me, I have a prenatal yoga class. What's going on? You owe me an explanation. He came over your dad. He offered me money to break up with you. $150,000. I hate him! He thinks just cause he has money, and he's Spence friggin' Montgomery, that he can do whatever he wants. He's a jerk! Yeah, he's a jerk. I'm sorry. If you didn't take the money, then why did you break up with me? Cause your dad's a jerk, but he's also right. I was getting in the way of your tennis career. I care about you too much to be the one to stand in the way of that. I'm not going to. If you care about me so much, then why won't you listen to me? I don't want you in my life. I need you in my life. And I can do both. I can have tennis and a relationship with you. I'm sorry. It's over. - I'm ready to leave. - No. Shut up. Just because we are single does not mean we can't have a fabulous time. All the single ladies, all the single ladies Put your hands up, up in the air... I don't think being single is what's holding me back. - What is? - I don't know being in a horrifically crappy mood. I don't get it. How come you're not in a crappy mood? Because Liam is a loser. And I'm fantastic. And I'm going to meet someone a thousand times better. We just have to keep our chins up so people don't pity us, and as a bonus, we won't get that whole pelican neck thing in our photos. Come on.? All the single ladies, all the single ladies...? Come on, sing with me, Silver. What? What are you staring at? Can I ask you a question? Why did you break up with him? You know why. I just want what's best for him. And how do you know what's best for Teddy? Isn't that the same patronizing attitude his father has? Shouldn't Teddy get a chance to make decisions for himself? There you are. - I have something to tell you. - No, wait. Me first. I want you to open for me on tour. What? It'll be a huge opportunity for you. - And we'll get to travel together... - Stop. I got back together with Navid. - Why? - I love him. I'm so sorry, Javier. Hey, getting ready to sing for these lucky kids? What's wrong? Adrianna just broke up with me. But it's not over till it's over. There you are. You're dressed up. I was getting ready for the party when I got your text. But it's cool. I got time. What's up? I came clean. I told my mom that I stole the coins. You did? And when my step-dad gets back from Miami, I'm going to tell him, too. At which point, my life will essentially be over, but... No, which brings me to my point... and my text. I'm so glad you made it because I really wanted you... - I wanted you here for this. - For what? What's going on? Take a look. My gosh. Liam, it's your boat! - It's on the water! I mean... - It floats. I know. It's amazing, Liam. So does it work? - I mean, does it sail? - Let's find out. Okay. I can't believe you did this. Man, I'm gonna get out of here. Sorry for the interruption. Would Ivy Sullivan please report to the planetarium?</i> Ivy Sullivan to the planetarium, please.</i> Hello? Hello? Early astronomers believed in the geocentric theory... that the earth was the center of the universe... but in the 16th century, Copernicus presented evidence for the heliocentric theory... that the sun was the center of the universe... but recently, Dixon Wilson has come up with a new understanding of our universe, he calls... Ivy-centric. You're it, Ivy. You're the only girl in this world for me. You're the center of my universe. Please forgive me. God, you're crazy, Dixon. Crazy about you. And also a little crazy, you know. Man, I've been working on this nonstop ever since we fought. Turns out Mr. Reiss has some connections here, so... if you don't take me back, hopefully I'll at least get a little extra credit. So what do you say? Okay. Okay, what? Okay... I would really like to be back with you. And it'd be nice if you'd still come to Australia cause I'd really like you to. - For real? - Yes, for real. Better get home and get your bags packed. We leave tonight. Go. Go already, go! And have fun. I was wrong. I love you and I want to listen to you, and... if you think that you can play tennis and be with me, then it's your decision. - You want to dance with me? - Sure. All right. Yes Howdy, Laurel and Hardy. How are we? - You're in a good mood. - Not really. Actually, feeling more like a piece of trash cause I was excited to be a father, you know, not just a father figure but, like, - a father. - You're wasted. No, what's the matter? I thought you were down with the fun, baby. Ryan, you need to go home. You need to go home and you need to sleep this off. Go home. The West Beverly Hills High School class of 2010 hereby passes the torch to the class of 2011. Ladies and gentlemen, the class of 2011. I need to get back to the school. I can't believe they made us take shuttles. Ridiculous. You just missed one. So drive me now. Next shuttle leaves in 15 minutes. 15 minutes? - I'm sorry you missed the party. - I'm not. How come you didn't name the boat? I thought I knew what I wanted to call it, but... I changed my mind, so... I guess the future is still unwritten. What are you thinking? I can't believe that you're going to tell your stepfather the truth. It's going to be rough. So why? I made a lot of mistakes in the past. I've done drugs, I've been violent. I didn't tell people the truth about what happened with Jen. I'm really sorry about that, I... But this year has changed me. I became someone who really wants to do the right thing. So yeah, it's going to be tough when I confess, but if I didn't, I don't know what that would do to me. I don't think I'd be able to live with myself. Yeah, well, you're a better person than I am. You would do the same thing if you were in my position. No, actually, I've done far worse and I haven't come clean. I was the one who killed Joe Herman. Naomi had that prom after party last year, and I was really upset and drunk. And I drove like that. I was coming down Mulholland when I hit something, and I just panicked. I didn't even get out of the car. I couldn't get out of the car. I just drove home and secretly got the car fixed the next morning, and I hoped that, you know, it was a coyote or something. But it wasn't. I found out online that I had hit a person. A man. And he was in a coma and then he died. And his name... his name was Joe Herman... and he was a... a human being and I killed him. What are you doing? Packing. Why are you staring like that? What makes you think you're going to Australia? Nobody said I couldn't. Then let me be clear... - you can't. - What?! When I said yes, I had no idea the trouble that you'd gotten into. I've been planning this for, for ages. I already promised Ivy. Look, this is an opportunity for me to go to Australia. - Please. - No. What, I'm supposed to stick around here all summer, listen to you and Dad fight? The decision is final, Dixon. Where were you? I had a meeting with the superintendent. At this time of night? What were you doing? Getting fired. - What?! - Some kid in the senior class tried to blackmail me for trying to protect Dixon. And I had to go to to Ms. Angus and tell her the truth; it was the only thing to do. And they let me go. Do you have anything to say on the subject? Maybe you shouldn't have lied. That's all you have to say... maybe I shouldn't have lied? I lose my job... everything, and all you can say is, - maybe I shouldn't have lied? - You want some words of wisdom from me? Some advice? Well, it's too late. Maybe you should've come to me before you made our lives a total mess. I made a total mess of our lives? I was doing what I thought was right! I was protecting our son! Who said that's what Dixon needed?! What about consequences? He needs to learn that actions have consequences. And, yes, you, you did make a mess of our lives. - How can you say that? - God... don't you get it, Harry? We don't have anything! You don't have a job. We don't have savings. And we don't love each other anymore! Is that true? - Is that true? You tell me. - You tell me. No, you tell me is that true! You look me in the eye, and you tell me if you're still in love with me. Hey, you two. Hey, Javier. What's up? I just wanted to talk to you. I know we're not together anymore but... I still think you're incredibly talented. - Yeah definitely... - No, well, the offer for you to go on tour with me still stands. What? Really? You're good, Adrianna. You should do it, Ade. Yeah, it's a huge opportunity, what better way to spend your summer? - I can go with you. - Really? Yeah, we could spend it together. My tour's not a summer tour. It's a whole year. Well, I'm still in school. And why do people go to school? To get the education they need to get the job of their dreams. Adrianna, this is your dream, right here, right now. I know it's not the safe move, but come on. Take a risk. Maybe. Hello? Hello? My car won't start. Who knew that could be a problem in the modern era, right? Apparently there are cars that don't start. And my cell phone died, so I just, need to borrow someone's phone to call AAA. - I didn't know it was you here, so... - Is everything okay, Naomi? No, it's not. Everything is not okay. Everything is wrong. And it's all my fault. Because I'm self-centered. I'm a liar. I'm a terrible person. No. You're not a terrible person. How can you say that? I almost ruined your life. But you didn't. Would you like a glass of water? Yeah. Are you sure you don't want me to go in with you? I have to do this alone. Well, I'm sleeping on my boat, you know, to enjoy my last night of freedom. I don't know if I'll get cell reception out there, but if you need me, you know where to find me. Thank you. Mom, Dad, I have something that I have to tell you. The animal kingdom is brutal. But no animal is as brutal as the Homo sapien.</i> Anyway, it goes on and on and on like that. Well, it's an amazing project. - I'm really impressed, seriously. - I'm glad. So... I'm not just some boring, old bastard, then? Of course not. No. I mean, you're talented. - Ah, you're just saying that. - No. Thank you. Means a lot to me. It's seems like a very important documentary. Thank you. You don't mind me holding your hand, do you? No, that's... no. It's fine. I should probably call AAA though, because... Come on. It's okay. I know you wanted me to kiss you. You don't have to feel guilty. What? I don't feel guilty. I don't want you to kiss me. Enough, Naomi. Enough with the teasing. I see the way you look at me. And your whole harassment fantasy? You're trying to provoke me. And now that you have, you're going to play the innocent? Don't bother. I know you want me to. Get away from me, you perv. - Stop it! Stop or I will tell. Stop! - Who're you going to tell? Who're you going to tell?
