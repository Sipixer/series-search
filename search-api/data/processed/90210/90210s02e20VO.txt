As of now, your life outside of school is over. What is going on? All this bitterness, all this sniping... We should go to counseling. - What? - I kissed another man. - I'm Teddy's girlfriend. - He has a girlfriend? Are we okay? We're definitely not okay. You moved here? You're back? Call me Karma, babe. And Karma is a bitch. What's wrong? My life is over. I'm sure you did fine on the Sats. Jen's back. She's back in LA? You know what? She's not our problem. - Everything is going to be okay. - But it's not. She bought the Beach Club. She's taken my Beach Club away from me. So, we'll hang out somewhere else. A man can only eat so many Yucatan chicken wraps. But I love it there. They come around and mist me while I'm tanning. Jen's trying to ruin my life again. Stay out of her way. Don't engage. Don't go anywhere near her. - But... - I'll mist you. You'll mist me? Sure. I'll mist you. Is that a portrait of me? It's an abstract. I'm sorry about what happened with my dad. I really am. I was completely humiliated. I should have told him about you, but the thing is, my dad, he's... he's tricky. He's got a big personality, and he can be kind of judgmental, And you don't think he'll like me. No, I do. He will. I really want him to like you. And this is new to me. I haven't done this. I've never known a girl that mattered enough to me to introduce to my father. I want to do it right. So... Come over and have dinner with me and my dad? And break bread with your kind-of-judgmental mega-movie-star dad? "Okay," she says, immediately regretting it. "Thank you," he says, getting ready to kiss her. Three dimes. I was thinking more like 18. But come on up. Have a look. We'll settle on something fair. I'm staying at the Pacific Waves Motor Hotel. Every bit as luxurious as it sounds. Two hours. So? So, my boy, we got a broker in Redondo who thinks they may only be worth $15,000. This is really gonna happen? The tackle shop and you and me living together? Thanks to you. What do you say we celebrate. - Rent a boat. Do some fishing. - That sounds good. Let me take care of my business, and we'll hit the high seas. - Is it okay if I make a call? - Take five and then we'll get busy. All right. Thanks. Take five? That's, like, actual recording studio talk. I am so excited. I'm excited you're excited, sweetie. Speaking of exciting... What would you think about maybe recording a duet with Javier? - It was the label's idea, but I... - Javier? As in, Javier-Javier? Javier-Javier-Javier. That's insane. I am, like, his biggest fan ever. I have his Christmas album, his kids' album. Anyway, slight snag. Javier's about ready to go out on tour, so this needs to happen fast. I can be anywhere, anytime. Scheduling? Not the snag. Check this out. Right? I'm out to four different writers, praying for something better. I could write it. I'd like to try. Why not? If you have something ready by Wednesday, we'll listen to it. - <i>Pacific Waves.</i> - Hi. Finn Court, please. Not here. Excuse me? Checked out about an hour ago. Excuse me. What are you doing? Why are you waving your tape measure in front of my house? My house. We need to take a look at the gutters on the other side. Sure. I pouted a little and Olivier bought it for me. For weekends. A sort of country house. You can't do this. - I already have. - I live here, Jen. For 29 more days, as stipulated by California law. But if the construction is going to bother you, feel free to vacate sooner. Peach Pit Team Season 02 Episode 20 Meet The Parent You must have ESP. I was just about to call you. I have to talk to you. I need to talk to you, too. Some pretty messed up stuff went down with my dad. Did he evict you? Did he give you 29 days to get out? Jen just bought my house. The one I live in. - What? - Now I'm going to kill her. You can't engage with her. She's rattlesnake. You can't go poking her with a stick. - You'll find a new place to live. - Really? How? I don't know. We'll find you something. Just promise me that you'll stay away from her. She's toxic. - So, I gave my dad these coins... - <i>I'm gonna go,</i> eat some ice cream, calm myself down. I'll call you back, babe. What? Javier Luna? That's seriously amazing. I know. Double amazing? Get this. Laurel, my producer? - She's letting me write the song. - What? I could be "singer-songwriter." I am so proud of you. Come here. I've got to go to the Blaze. We'll talk more. See you later? See you. Well, well, well. The plot thickens. What is that supposed to mean? Why are you wiggling your eyebrows? He's my friend. He just got a girlfriend. Don't kill me. Do you wish he didn't? Navid will always be very special to me. But he's with Lila now and he's happy. So I respect that. And he totally deserves to be happy after everything I put him through, so... Just had to ask. I got a question for you. Is it an eyebrow-wiggling type question? What's Teddy's dad like? I have to go over there for dinner, I just want to know what I'm in for. - You're meeting Spence? - Why do you say it like that? - Is he scary? - He's just really intense. He either loves people or hates people. And when he hates people... Are you nervous? Now I am. - What's up? - Not much. Are you pissed at me? I'm not pissed at you. I'm not really into this whole getting blown off thing. But I'm not blowing you off. I just really appreciate direct communication. So... if you don't like me, or you don't like blondes, or you don't like the way I chew... Ivy, stop. You're getting the wrong idea. All I want to do is hang out with you, - but you know I'm grounded. - So... call me when you can, I guess. - Wait. - What? That doesn't mean that you can't come to my house. - Am I allowed to? - I don't know. But, what I do know is my parents are going out tonight. And... I can't wait any longer to hang out with you. All right. - All right? - Yeah, all right. All right. No more wraps or mozzarella sticks. I want to class this place up, Tio. Comprende? I want more... European flair. How does a coq au vin chopped salad grab you? Good. We have a good selection now... Hold that thought, Tio. To be continued. - What do you want? - Other than world peace? You can have any house in Beverly Hills, and you had to have mine. Something doesn't smell right. - Probably Tio's aftershave. - You want something, Jen. As a matter of fact, I do want something. While I was in France, Olivier and I, we fell back in love. It took time, but... I had to forgive him for his indiscretions and learn to trust him again. And we are more in love than ever. Waiter, barf bag. Which is why I can't allow you to tell him what happened last year. He could never handle the thought of me with another man. He's very jealous. You don't want me to tell him what a big tramp you are? Exactly. You know what? Do whatever you want? I owe you a very big apology. I have done some terrible things to you. And I am really truly very sorry. You can have the house. I'll give it to you. But what I would really like... is another chance with you. Really? You're the only sister I've got. Please give me another chance. And I would love for you to get to know Olivier. Join us for dinner tomorrow night. Please. Guess who? - Hillary Clinton? - Close. - Tila Tequila? - Closer. Lila, is that you? I have a story idea. Everyone's talking about Adrianna and Javier. We should do a piece. I thought you were, sensitive about the Ade thing. I was. My chest basically turned to concrete at the mention of her name. I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause we've been hanging out so much, or maybe it's 'cause we've gotten closer. But recently, no concrete. - That's cool. - That is cool. Sorry. I tried knocking, but... I'm not doing this Matthews' project by myself. I barely know who Vivaldi is. Are you okay? - Where did you get the boat? - I built it. You built a boat? That's what I do when I want to blow off some steam. What got you all steamed up? You can talk to me. Come on, you were there when I found out my parents were all messed up, so you can definitely trust me. My dad meant a lot to me when I was a kid. And, we were, like, really close, and we went sailing. Sailing was our thing. Anyway, he hasn't been around for a while, and just recently... out of the blue, he showed up, and... like an idiot, I got all excited thinking he was gonna stay. As soon as he got what he wanted, he took off. And... Just whatever, so... I haven't really told anybody about my dad, so if you... What about Naomi? You should tell her. She is your girlfriend. Jack, neat, and, let me have one of those local beers you're always touting. Just a ginger ale for me. I'm getting a little old for vomiting and hangovers, don't you think? You're never too old for vomiting and hangovers. Says you. It's a work thing. Cross your fingers they're not dragging me back to the studio. Hello, darling. Can I say two words to you? Signature umbrellas. - That's what this place needs. - That's a good idea. This is Ryan Matthews, Naomi's teacher. Ryan, this is Olivier, my husband. An educator. It's a pleasure to meet you. - Drinks on the house. - That's okay. It's no skin off my face. We own the Beach Club. That's a great thing to own. It's not the Dodgers, but... We should get to our table. Ryan, it was lovely to see you. Indeed, it was. Great meeting you. Pleasure was mine. Can I get a little whiskey in the ginger ale? Make it a double. Watch the carbon footprint. I can't write. I can't. I have lost my ability to string words together. This was my big chance, and I'm totally blowing it. You've written songs before. But not like this. I don't know what's happening. Everything I write is terrible. And the more I write, the terribler it gets. "Terribler." Listen to me. I totally can't even talk. Let me see. You're probably just being hard on yourself. - I'm ruined. - You're not. - You got to get out of your head. - And how do I do that, by banging it against the wall? 'Cause I already tried that. I'll figure something out. I'm sorry. It was supposed to be just us, but my dad invited a few friends. My half-sister Kate might be here. You'd like Kate. She's really nice. Like, obsessed with horses, but really nice. Please, if you keep talking about this contract, I'll throw you on the grill. Have it your way, but if the deal doesn't close, don't call me crying. - I'll call you screaming. - Whatever. Dad, you remember... Don't bill me for this hour, either, Arthur. Dad, this is Silver from the match. Hi, Silver. What an unusual name. - Actually, it's... - I hope you're hungry. Take a look at this piece of meat. Is this not gorgeous? Come on. Peter Luger. - Actually, Silver's a vegetarian. - Does she eat chicken? Not so much. Let's see, maybe I've got a veggie burger with your name on it. - Put it right there. - Perfect. So, Teddy says you don't play tennis. Sadly I don't. - But I... - Silver's really into the Blaze. What is that? Is that a junior arsonist club? It's like a magazine. It's like a newspaper, - but actually, it's more of a news... - Silver's a journalist. In my field, I've met hundreds of journalists, and I never liked one. Dr. Fun to the rescue! I don't see how playing Skee-Ball is gonna get this song written. Trust me, if you aren't inspired and out of your head in one hour, I will release you from my clutches. Deal? Deal. Dr. Fun? See that homeless man in the white shirt? I think that's Mr. Matthews. I got into a little tussle with this chili dog, and I have to admit defeat, cause just... look at it. It's a worthy adversary. Are you cool? Why, don't I look cool... hanging on to the trash can. Are you sure you're okay? Guys, please. This "Mr. Matthews," it's so formal. When we're outside of school, try something like "Mr. Ryan... Matthews." I'm gonna hit the road. Papers to grade. You're both getting A's. All right. - Wait, are you calling a taxi? - Taxi. Taxi Driver. Great movie! - You talkin' to me? - What? - You talkin' to me? - No. You know, from the thing. The movie. Right. So, are you having an okay time? Sorry I'm so tongue-tied. I feel like I'm making - a horrible first impression. - You're doing great. Sorry I'm late. You're, the horse lover. It's Kate, right? Teddy's sister? Actually, Heidi here is my dad's girlfriend. We met on set. That's right, and in a very good movie, too. Into Arabia. Did you ever see that film, Yes, I did. - Great film, no? - Great film. Great film. You didn't like it. I mean, it's kind of just a diff... erent... Actually, no, I didn't like it. It employed a bunch of played-out, fear-mongering stereotypes of Arab people. The female characters, they were offensively sexist and idiotic, frankly, it was a waste of your talent. To tell you the truth... I don't think you're wrong. That woman that astrophysicist character What was she doing in Lebanon? - I don't remember. - Rocking her gold lamé bikini. Exactly. That's exactly right. Funny girl. Get me off this ride before I get all Mr. Ryan Matthews on that trash can. Funnel cake wasn't the wisest move. No, we should go. This was really nice of you, but honestly, it's pointless. I'm so stupid for thinking I could actually write a real song. Will you just cut it out? I'm not gonna listen to you beat yourself up about this. I have 3 minutes, I say we hit the bumper cars. No, bumper cars, okay? Just let it go, please? What? Why? Because, Ade... you can do this. I know you can. I believe in you. I see you like this, all depressed and down on yourself, it hurts. It's like the worst feeling in the world. Seeing you happy, that means everything to me. I gotta take this. Lila, hey. I had a lot of work at the Blaze, so I'm just hanging out at the pier. Okay, I'll meet you at the Beach Club. - Sorry about that. - It's fine. So, where were we? Leaving. Your plan actually worked, Dr. Fun. I'm inspired. I really want to go home and write. Let's hit the road. Wait, should we get some dessert? I don't know. Are you trying to prolong dinner? Sadly, I do not see your sister coming, Jennifer. She'll be here. She's just late. Trust me, I know my sister, and I know she'll come. I could try the mango sorbet. Here she is. You must be Naomi. I am Olivier, your brother. Please, don't kiss me. And sit back down. I'm not gonna be here that long. I think there are a few things you deserve to know about my sister. I'm sure Jen probably told you she spent last year pining for you, but the truth's she was pretty much slutting it up with any semi-rich guy who would look halfway in her general direction. What? And you might find this interesting: she also slept with my boyfriend. He was, what, 16 at the time? Is this true? No, of course it's not true. You disgust me. C'est fini. Au revoir. As they say in French. So I'm gonna head back home and pack. Bye. - Ladies first. - Thank you. This is unreal. You know, I thought I went a little overboard, but, I just hope you're not wearing anything flammable. No, way. Are these kogi short rib tacos? Yeah, they are. I know they're you're favorite. I've been chasing the truck all day on Twitter. I made it to Abbot Kinney and back. Of course, I had to go to a different taco truck for the cokes. And you got Mexican cokes. Of course. Dixon, you... Dude, what was that? My parents. Mom? Dad? Hey, buddy, mom forgot her wallet! What would you like me to say? That Mom forgot the slip of paper with the marriage counselor's address on it? I just feel like you think everything is my fault. Like this whole thing is... is my fault. You know what? Save it for Dr. Silla. What's going on in here? You know, I just, I forgot my wallet. What is going on? - Nothing. - Why? You gotta be kidding me, right? Nothing? Really? I'm not an idiot, you guys. - Be right back. - I have to talk to you right now. Right now isn't the greatest time. - Talk to us. - Talk to you? Fine! I know that you two have been fighting. And I know it's because Mom kissed some guy. - Oh, my God. - What?! Look... Mom and I I have been having some problems, that's true. We didn't want to say anything to you guys until we understood what was going on ourselves. We've been seeing a counselor. A marriage counselor? Yes. We don't have dinner plans tonight. We have a session. Wait. So Mom kissed who? That's not important, and it's not all Mom's fault. The problems are mutual. But we don't want you two to worry about it. So then there's nothing to worry about. You know, you promise that everything's gonna be okay. We love you guys and we're doing the best that we can. We need to get to our appointment. Guys, this is us trying. We'll talk about it later, okay? I feel like I'm gonna throw up. I mean, I'm confused. What are we supposed to feel about this now? What are we gonna do? Can we talk about this later? What? Fine. Whatever. Sorry about that. Family's a little crazy, I guess. You okay? Sorry, about that. I don't even know what that was. Stop apologizing. - I mean, that was... - Messed up. To the victor go the spoils. - Can I pour you a glass? - No, I'm good. What's going on? The dragon is slain. You said you were gonna stay away from her. I know, but Jen is a rattlesnake, you said so yourself, and you don't let a rattlesnake slither around screwing up your life. You chop off its ugly head. You should have seen her face when I told Olivier about how she's been whoring around town. It looked like a pen exploded onto her Kelly bag. That's good. Something's been going on with me, and I... What if Olivier's so pissed at her that he locks her out and she has to stay in a cabana at the Beach Club or something? Can you imagine? How was the pier? It was okay. Went with Ade. Navid, it's totally cool, Lila, there's something that I have to tell you. I think you're so amazing, and you're brilliant and-and so much fun. Those sound like bad compliments. I realized tonight that I still feel something for Ade. I don't even know what it means or what I'm even gonna do about it, but I know it's not fair to you, and I think we should break up. I really am sorry, Lila. What's up? I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm here, but I'm here and I had a really rough night, and I needed to blow off some steam. - Okay. - Can I help? Do the stern. Actually... the other end. It's just ironic. All these years, I... I've spent trying to relax, you know. Just-just trying to believe that life can be stable. That just because my family was always falling apart when I was little, doesn't mean it's going to fall apart now. Right? Then when I finally relax... it falls apart. Damn. I must have been rambling. It's been, like, an hour. I feel like I owe you 100 bucks or something. Give me a break. You can't get good therapy for 100 bucks. But, Dixon, you have nothing to apologize for. I'm actually really honestly flattered that you feel like you can talk to me. You're just easy to talk to. And, look, I know you told me not to apologize, but this has got to be our worst date yet. I don't think so. I mean, dates are for getting to know each other, right? And I am getting to know you. And I'm liking what I'm knowing. Hey, Dad. Silver's a charming girl. And she rides a motorcycle. How cool is that. A Vespa, but... Yeah, she is cool. I'm glad you think she's cool. You know you're my favorite, don't you? I'm not supposed to say that, but it's true. Thanks, Dad. I'm so proud of you. I know you can take this tennis all the way if you just started taking it a little more seriously. I'm at practice like ten times a week. Right, and now you're at a point where you have to make a decision. You going to go pro, or you going to give out lessons at the Beach Club. I want to be Federer. You know that. That's all I want. Then it's settled. No more distractions. No more girlfriends. Break up with her, Teddy. Hey, superstar. What do you say to a matinee before your match tonight? A movie? You're kidding, right? Yes? Yeah, and I'll just bring a tub of popcorn to my match. Look, I don't just show up. I've got to warm up, I've got to talk to my coach, I've got to mentally prepare. - I have to focus. - Okay. I'm sorry, - I didn't realize how involved... - I got to get to class. Rise and shine, pet. - What the hell are you doing here? - I'm just here to thank you for making me ten million Euro richer. That's approximately $16 million U.S. Croissant? What are you talking about? Last night, your performance was truly magnificent, and absolutely predictable. Olivier was so distraught he went running straight into the, shall we say, arms of another woman. Which is exactly what he's done every other time he's gotten jealous in the past. You wanted him to cheat on you? When we got back together, we added a fidelity clause to our prenup. A few choice snaps from my PI, and voila, I'm 16 mill richer. You're disturbed. Now, now. Let's not get nasty. You really should be a little nicer to me now that - I'll be handling your finances. - What? I felt obliged to tell Daddy how you've been blowing through your trust fund. The poor guy, he started panicking. Luckily, I offered to help. This is not happening. This is a nightmare. Naomi, aren't you hungry? You beat him in straight sets. I told you, all you got to do is focus. Give me this thing. We'll put it in the trophy room. Wimbledon, here we come. - Let me get this for you. - Thanks. I was actually just on my way over to your place. I've got to apologize. I was thoughtless... I'm the one who should apologize. I was stressed I shouldn't have taken it out on you. I'm really sorry. So we're even? - Even. - How was your match? I won in straight sets. I assume that's good. As you know, I'm not exactly a tennis buff, but - winning's winning, right? - Except no. I thought winning today would make me happy, but when I won and I didn't have you, I realized it doesn't mean anything if you're not there, cause... Because... - Because... - Because you're falling in love? Because I am in love. - She killed it. - That was hot. You killed it, sweetie. - Take five. - Thank you. Damn, you wrote this song in two days? This single's gonna be huge. It's got a great hook. Did you write it for your boyfriend? No, I don't have a boyfriend. - I'm here to see Adrianna. - Oh, she's inside. Cute flowers. A beautiful girl like you doesn't have a boyfriend? No. I don't. There's no one, no special guy...
