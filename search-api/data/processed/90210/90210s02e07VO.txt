She's dying. What's best for Silver is that you leave her alone. I'd like to move in with you. My kids are juniors in high school. I actually have pictures. This is my son Dixon. College is a big decision. I will be going to California University. CU isn't going to happen. You're going to focus on the SATs? Yeah, no. I'm going to date the dean's son. Are you Richard? Naomi. I'm Jamie, by the way. Hey. There you are. Jamie, this is... My roommate, Richard. I actually thought you had a crush on my husband. What? Knock yourself out. Oh, perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Oh, what the hell? I know. Right? Dude, this blows. I just snapped a fin. Who cares about your fin? I got a big dent in my car. Relax, man. It's just a dent. A big dent. What, like $500 tops? You want some cash? I'm totally cool to split it. I don't want your money. Okay... So, what do you want? Uh, an apology. You hit me. I saw you backing out and I stopped. Well, then this would be your fault, too. No? Why are you stopping in the middle of the parking lot? Are you seriously blaming me? Well, clearly, I didn't see you. Well, maybe that's because you're a little girl who's driving a car that's clearly too big for you. Right. You know what, dude? Maybe I do owe you an apology. I am so sorry that you are such a sexist ass. You know, screw you! Oh, right back at you, loser. All right, so for today's main attraction, you want to go Journey Earth Jungles or Caves? Uh, which one's shorter? More time for our post-film discussion. I like the way you think, babe. Let's go Caves. There's supposed to be some sick shots of hydrogen-eating bacteria. So, does your mom love the environment as much as you do? My mom? Yeah, right. Been trying to get the admissions office to go paperless forever. Well, maybe we should double-team her. Try to convince her to go green together. Reduce, reuse, recycle. Hey, guys. Hey, Jamie. So... I, uh, calculated the electric bill. Looks like you're responsible for about 2/3. Not a problem. What do I owe you? It's not what you owe me, man. It's what you owe the planet. Just need a dollar amount, Richard. All right, I'm going to hop in the shower. The Pi Phi Crush Party starts in about an hour. Do you guys want to come? Oh, no. We're good, thanks. Yeah, watching people drink out of red plastic cups just kind of makes me want to barf. Mmm. How oblivious is that guy? He takes, like, two showers a day. Doesn't he know we live in a desert? Duh. People who shower a lot are so gross. God, you're great. So, what do you think? Should we double-team your mom? Try to get the admissions office to go green? Unfortunately, I don't think that'll work. The earth is full of secrets. Be prepared to unlock them as we travel deep within our glorious planet. Join us on Journey Earth. Uh, we could do Chinese. Again. Or Thai. I think three times a week is my Thai limit. And chance you might want to... Ooh, we cannot go out, Dixon. People could see me. I could get in real trouble. We could just say that we're friends. Come on. This whole relationship can't take place in your apartment. Uh, well, I would go to your place, but you live with your parents. Hmm. And I am not sneaking in the window Katie Holmes style. Dawson's Creek. Forget it. You were too young. Look, baby, just pick a place. I'm going to get changed for work. Morning. Morning. You were working late last night, huh? Again. Kelly wasn't there, if that's what you're getting at. But Mr. Wong looked very sexy in his lab coat. Don't do that. Don't joke about it. Honey, I apologize for calling you Kelly, but that happened two days ago and it was an honest mistake. I mean, come on, do you really think that something is going on between us? What am I supposed to think? You and I have been fighting lately. We're on completely different pages with the kids. I got a vibe a couple of months ago that she liked you. And now you're calling me by her name. Yeah, you got that vibe after we accidentally ate pot brownies. Being high doesn't mean you can't see the truth. There are plenty of very savvy pot smokers out there. You want to take that anti-drug message up to the kids, or should I? Look, I am genuinely sorry for the slip-up. And I understand why it upset you. The only reason that I called you Kelly is because I had work on my mind. That's all. Look, and you're right. Hey. Things have been stressful around here lately. With Annie and the move and... We've got to start making time for each other. Hmm? So, why don't you come by the school tomorrow? And we'll have lunch. Okay? Yeah. Okay. What do you mean, you don't have the prescription? My mom's out of pills and she's in a lot of pain. Look, I don't care how you get them, you just have to get them! I'm sorry. I'm... I'm just really frustrated. I called this in yesterday and you guys... Yeah. Yeah, fine. I... I'll try back later. Hey. Hi. How are you holding up? I'm fine. You don't look fine. You look tired. Well, that's because there's a lot to do. In case you forgot, our mom has cancer. I didn't forget. And by the way, you don't have to live with her to prove to me that you can. Look, that might be why I went there. But it's not why I'm staying. You can't be happy. It's not about me being happy. It's about the fact that she's dying. Okay, but you're not her nurse. Yeah. You're right. I'm her daughter. At least one of us is acting like it. Left Dixon a message. No answer. It's the second practice he's missed, man. Coach is gonna be pissed. Ha... Gnarly pissed. Damn. Check him out. Whoa-ho-ho-ho... Gnarly, huh? You're looking at the winner of last year's Amateur 16 and Under O.P. Pro. And the newest member to West Bev's Surf Team. Wait. Are you serious? Wow. That dude is gonna give us a serious leg up on the competition. Uh, yeah, that's not a dude, buddy. Ivy! Come here! She's on the team? You have got to be kidding me. Sync by honeybunny - corrected by chamallow35 www.addic7ed.com And I want you to prepare a timeline detailing every... Sorry. I was at a doctor's appointment. Just take a seat. Your timelines should include everything that you deem relevant to the Civil Rights Movement. All right, this row... Turn to your right. That's your partner for the assignment. This row, turn to your right. That's your partner for the assignment. So... your place or mine? How about I just do the assignment and put your name on it? Gosh. If I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't like me. I don't. You're pompous and arrogant and you totally screwed with Adrianna. No, I didn't. We just wanted different things. Whatever. You know, after we got off the phone last night, I could not stop thinking about you. Me, neither. Well, it was 4:00 a.m., so I fell asleep pretty quickly, but until then... See, I couldn't even sleep. You've got my neurons firing on all cylinders, Annie. I was so juiced, I, uh... started working on my screenplay. I thought you had writer's block. I did, because I couldn't figure out who the heroine was. But last night, it hit me. She's you. You're my muse, babe. How would you feel about being in my movie? I'd love to. Hey, Coach. Hey. Look, I'm sorry I missed yesterday. Second time in a week, man. You're off the team. What?! You're obviously not committed. No. No, I am! Look, I just had a... a family emergency. It won't happen again. Please. Just... just give me one more chance, man. This team means so much to me. Please. IVY: Anyways, so then we find out that my house in Malibu burnt down 'cause of those... those brush fires. Your house burned down? Yeah. No way! Yeah, and get this. We don't even find out for, like, another three days. We were hanging out with, like, Ray LaMontagne and Ben Harper, and Ben was, like, "Dude, I think your house burnt down." And I was, like, "Dude, who cares? It's just a house." Excuse me? Okay, guys, gather up! How'd it go? Well, um, I'm on probation, but I'm still on the team. Man, I was sweating back there. So, the antes just went up for tomorrow. Billabong has donated a limited-edition handmade board, which is gonna go to the rider with the highest all-around score. Shut... up! Pretty gnarly, huh? So let's get in the water, let's make this practice count! Okay? Let's go! Man, you know, I could really use that board, since some douche bag damaged mine. You know it was your fault. Why don't you just apologize? I am happy to, once you apologize for being a sexist pig. You're out of your mind. Oh, my God... you're right. I've totally been acting crazy, huh? Sorry. It's just, um... I'm on my... my period, you know? Oh. Um... yeah. Yeah, no... problem. Wow. You actually bought that. Dude, you are worse than I thought you were. Laters. Uh-oh. Oh. What would Richard think about this? What was I thinking? I cannot believe I did that. Okay, Naomi, come on, what are you... what are you doing with Richard? Hmm? I mean, he's so... not your type. I... he's nice. We're getting to know each other. Mm. Okay. Let me walk you to your car. So, I'm sitting here with my grandfather at a football game, and I must've been, like, six or seven, and the first thing I'm thinking is, "Ew, maroon and black? I hate those colors together." But then the cheerleaders came out and the marching band did their thing, and... everyone was just yelling and screaming. They were so into it... by the end of the day, I was, like, "You know, Grandpa, maroon and black aren't so bad after all." Oh, that's when I knew I was smitten with CU. Mm. You know, it's funny, I remember the first time that I realized that I didn't mind the school colors. When? Oh, uh, you were kidding. Yeah, I'm kidding. Maybe a little. So, are you and your grandfather close? We were, yeah. He-he passed away five years ago, so... I'm sorry. Yeah, it sucked. We always had a really special connection. I was kind of his favorite. Well, I'm... I'm sure you're lots of people's favorite. Man, I wish... I wish you weren't dating Richard, because I... I really want to kiss you. But you are, so I... I won't. We should get going. Uh, yeah. Yeah. So, uh... do you need a ride to school? Nope. I have a ride. With that guy you been hanging out with? Um, Jasper... is that his name? Yeah. Why? I don't know, he just... seems a little sketchy, that's all. Do you even know him? No, but... He doesn't hang out with the West Beverly kids because they're all judgmental lemmings... like you. Annie, like... No, it's true. And-And who are you to be calling someone sketchy? If anyone's sketchy around here, it's you. What's that supposed to mean? It means you've been sneaking out of the house at night, going who knows where, lying to Mom and Dad. And where have you been going? Exactly. Sketchy, like I said. Oh, it's so unfair, okay? Jamie is, like, the perfect guy, and I'm stuck with smelly, shower-hating Richard. You're not stuck with him... you can always end your fake relationship. And not get into CU? Yeah, no. Come on, it's not like Richard has even invited you to meet his mom. Oh, no, he did... he called me this morning. She's throwing some kind of cocktail party. Ostensibly, we're gonna stop her from ung paper napkins, but still... Wow. Yeah. So I have to put Jamie out of my mind, completely, end of story, because look what happened to you. You went after some shiny pretty boy and got stuck with nothing. I can't do that. Thanks for that. Thank you. I just mean, I can't let myself get distracted by rock-hard abs and thighs that have driven countries to war. Okay, what country has ever been driven to war over thighs? Look, I'm sorry that the agency double-booked you, but I really... I have to have a nurse tonight. Last night it was just me, and I can't... Shoot. Um, I have to go, okay? But I'm gonna call you back after class. Just please, try to make it work. Thanks. All right, everyone, I'll collect your projects now. Thank you. Thank you. Um... I... I actu... uh, I forgot it. I... it's okay. You don't have to cover for me. We worked at my house last night, and I forgot the project at home. Silver even called to remind me, but I just flaked. Sorry. Bring it in tomorrow. Teddy, you'll be penalized a whole grade. See? Told you I wasn't a bad guy. No one asked you to do that. Come in. Hi. Uh, hang on one sec. Now, I assume that you are here to talk to the President about health care reform. Senior evals, actually. Oh, well, you've come up with any new and exciting ways to trick colleges into accepting our slackers? You okay? Kelly, what's going on? It's... it's Silver. She okay? Yeah. No. I don't know. She moved out. Our mom has cancer, and she moved out. What? I can't really talk about it right now. I have to get to a meeting. Um, maybe we could grab... lunch later. I could use somebody to talk to. Yeah, of course. Okay. Thanks. Hey, hon. Hey. What's up? Um, bad news. I'm swamped here. Could we reschedule our lunch? Sure. No problem. Maybe we can go as the Rat Pack. Right. Like you're even gonna show. You've been ditching everything lately. I'll be there, all right? I was thinking maybe I could be Sinatra. And Liam could be Sammy Davis Jr. Yeah, I don't... really do Halloween. That's lame, man. Think Navid'll come? Nah. I don't think he wants to run into Ade. Hold on, hold on. Uh... got to take this. Come on, man. Hello? Hey, baby. So, um, I got a gig tonight that's gonna go late, so I was thinking that you could come by after school. Uh, I... I can't; I have a surf meet later on today. Okay, well, just come by after that. I don't leave until 9:00. Um... You see, there... there's this Halloween party that... I kind of wanted to hit. You'd rather go to a high school Halloween party than be with me? No. No. Uh... you know, it's just that I haven't really been able to hang out with my friends lately, and I don't want to ditch them. Come on, baby, you hang out with your friends every day, while I hardly ever get to see you. Oh. You know what? Shoot. This is call-waiting. Look, I'll... I'll see you at 6:00, okay? Bye. I know she's dying, but that doesn't erase all the damage she's done. I'm just trying to look out for my sister. Of course you are. Oh, you should see the way Silver looks at me, though. Like I am a horrible person. Uh... I thought you might be hungry, but I see that you... made time for lunch, after all. Excuse me. Hey. Deb, wait. No. I will not have this conversation here. And welcome to the 33rd annual L.A. County Surf Invitational. This year we have West Beverly and Sunset Hills taking on the top-ranked Malibu Canyon High School. All right, guys, listen up, listen up. So, uh, Teddy, Paul and Padma are in heat one. Liam and Ivy are in heat two. Ben and David, heat three. And Robbie, Michael and Kyle are last, and Dixon's sitting out. Okay, so the top two in each heat is gonna move on to the semifinals. The top two in the semis is gonna move on to the finals, and the winner, well, I'm sure I don't have to remind you guys what's at stake. Let's have a gnarly meet, okay? And the first team is heading into the water. Sunset Hills and Malibu Canyon go for this early wave. That's West Beverly's Kenny Montgomery. Oh, a vicious wipeout by Sunset Hills. Worried about being schooled by a girl? Just promise me you won't cry when I kick your ass. And that's West Bev's Liam Court up on five feeter surf. That's Ivy Sullivan with a great ride. And that's Liam Court cutting off his own teammate Ivy Sullivan. Which brings us to the end of the second heat. Yo, what the hell was that? You totally cut me off, dude. I was on the inside, I had the right of way. Sorry. I didn't see you. I get it. Sort of like how I didn't see you in the parking lot. Very funny. That's not what I meant. Right. Hey, there you are. Oh, listen, we're taking off. We were going to see if you were going to come by the Halloween party later. I can't. I have to finish this assignment. What? Ade and I were talking, and... Okay, why do you have that, "you might not like this," tone in your voice? Because you might not like this, but we need to say it. Say it. Um... okay, we just, uh, we think maybe you've bitten off more than you can chew. You know, with your mom. I've got everything under control. We know, but... See, there are no buts. I have no choice here. She's my mom. Why can't anybody understand that? I'm sorry. I can't sit here and talk about this. I have too much work to do. Have fun at the party. Bye. All right, we're in the final round, and clearly West Bev has the competitive edge today. Our last two surfers are both Wildcats. Liam Court and Ivy Sullivan. Ow! Dude, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow! Ow! You okay? No, I'm cramping up. Here, let me give you a hand. Sucker. And time's up, as Ivy Sullivan catches the final break. Baby, I thought you weren't going to show. Come on in. Sasha, um... wait. I'm actually not staying. Why not? Because this relationship just isn't working. What do you mean? I mean, we can't go anywhere or do anything. Wh... what do you expect? You're in high school. But that doesn't change the fact that I want to be able to go out with the girl that I'm dating. I want to be able to introduce her to my friends. Let her be a part of my life. You're just thinking about this now, after you've roped me back in and made me care? Look, I'm sorry. You're sorry? Sasha, I thought we would find a way to make this work. We haven't. So, I think it's best that we just end things. Sasha, I... I'm sorry... Get out of here. Get out of here. So you've been seeing her this whole time? Man, I had no idea. Sasha wanted me to not tell anyone. So I had to keep it on the down low. Now it's over. Dude, I'm sorry. Hey, it's cool. You know, uh, Sasha... sh... she's a great girl, but we just... it couldn't work. You a farmer? What? Your Halloween costume. I'm not wearing a costume. So let me ask you this. When you say it's over with Sasha, is it over, over, or just over until you see her later for some hot make-up sex? No, no, no, it's... it's over, over. Absolutely over. You know, I'm officially back. He's back. Uh-huh. He's back. Yeah. So my friends and I couldn't decide. Are you supposed to be, like, Johnny Depp or a Jonas Brother? Uh, he's a farmer. I'm not a farmer. Farmhand. Worker on a farm. Whatever, man. I'm just saying, I wouldn't have come in costume if I knew you weren't. I'm in costume. I'm a future C.U. sorority girl. Have you heard from Silver? Is she going to come? No, she's still at school finishing that project. I feel bad. Do you think we overstepped? Yeah, maybe a little. It came from a good place. It was just... it was hard to know how to act or what to say. I mean, I've never had a friend whose mother was dying of cancer. What? Silver's mom has cancer? Um... I'm gonna go get some food. I'll be back when he's gone. Well, does she? You're Rob Pattinson, right? I could tell 'cause of your messy hair. I'm not wearing a costume. Oh, after you. What, you decided to come as a gentleman for Halloween or something? Ivy. Sorry. I didn't realize it was you. By all means, cut to the front of the line, since cheating is how you get ahead. Okay, look, dude, the only reason I said I had a cramp was because you cut me off. So let's just say I gave you a taste of your own medicine. As long as you're comfortable knowing you didn't deserve to win. I can beat you anytime, anywhere, okay? You want to bet? Game on. This is a suicide competition, which means there is only one rule: first one to wipe out loses. And as for the loser... I will drink your blood. All right, catch some waves. Let's go, boy. Oh! Yeah! My boy! Okay, so... This is the surprise place you wanted to take me? The beach club? We're here to shoot a scene from my movie. Are you serious? Mm-hmm. It's scene 11. Okay... The script. Your character... she's gonna go and, uh, borrow a car, take it for a joyride. I'm thinking this Bentley. Um, and by borrow, do you mean steal? No, by borrow, I mean borrow. The valets... they always leave the keys right on top of the tires. The party's just getting started, so nobody's even going to know the difference. I can't. Come on, Annie, live a little. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. I just... No. This is just... it's what you got to do in low-budget filmmaking. Look, don't you want to make this movie? Yes, yes, but... Remember, you're my muse, babe. I know. I know, but... Maybe we could just ask the owners. But then we have to go through all this paperwork, licensing. I don't know, I mean, it's cool, I guess. Let's just forget it. Jasper... I just thought... Whatever, let's just go. Come on. Jasper. Those aren't going to help. I didn't think they would, but I had to at least try. Look, I'm sorry I cancelled on you today. Kelly's mom has cancer. She came into my office, she started crying, she wanted to have lunch... Stop. Just stop. You lied. I omitted. Okay, I lied, but only because you're so sensitive about Kelly. Because she has a crush on you. You're wrong. I'm not. And you know what's even worse, is you're playing into it. Her mother is dying. I know. I am sorry for that, I am, but she should not be going to her married boss with her problems. Deb... No, listen to me. She likes you. That's why she's confiding in you. And you need to stop beingo obtuse and face what's going on. I'm going to yoga. I need to calm down. Hey. What are you doing here? Look, I know you don't like me, but I heard about your mom. I'm really sorry. Save it. I don't need your pity. I'm not here to pity you. We're not friends. I know. So why are you here? Because... My mom died three years ago. Thought you might want to talk to someone who knows what you're going through. But... I get it. You don't. Wait. I don't... don't want to talk. I mean... I do. So that's why you moved back East, to take care of your mom? Yeah. It was like I was living this weird double life, you know? When I was at school, I thought about things like tests and parties. But... back home, it was all oxygen and nebulizers. Yeah, I know what you mean. Everyone, my friends, my sister, they just, they just don't get it. I mean, they think that I'm taking on too much. But... How could you live with yourself if you weren't there for her? Exactly. I don't, I don't know how long we have left. I keep trying to build some sort of a relationship... Trust me, I get it. Doesn't mean it's not hard as hell. I... I've been working so hard not to admit that, you know? I just, I don't want everyone to jump down my throat and say "See? You can't handle it." You can handle it. It just gets so overwhelming, you know? Sometimes, I just... I just want to scream. Come on. Come on. Um... I'm gonna show you how I used to blow off steam. You won this, fair and square. Thanks. Yep. And, look, you're a really good surfer. Thank you. For a girl. Dude, what is your deal? It's like you really... You're kidding? Right. Whatever, dude. So I might be slightly sensitive to gender stereotypes, okay? Oh, slightly? Dude, growing up surfing, I just had to prove myself to the guys, over and over and over again. It was just, it was a pain in the ass, you know? Just constantly being... underestimated or whatever. Whoa, wait. Just so we're clear, I never underestimated you, okay? I know you're a great surfer. I also know you are lousy with apologies. Great. Are we back to the car? We're back to the car. Why is it so important to you that I apologize? Let's just say I've been underestimated, too. What, people assume you're a bad driver? People assume I'm bad, period. So, when something's not my fault, I don't like to be blamed for it. I'm sorry I hit you. It was my fault. Thank you. Can I just say one more thing? Hmm? I would have kicked your ass today if I hadn't started showing off. And if it was a girls- only competition. You are... What? Nothing. What? Are we have a staring contest? No, dude. But, I mean, if we were, I would totally win. Okay. Yeah, you're crazy. Okay. Bye. Later on. Screw all of them! Let's just take the car and-and never come back. I'm serious. We'll disappear, just the two of us. Great. Okay. Now, now, get to the car. You're reckless, you're free. Keys. Go. That was perfect. You are a natural, babe. How did it feel? Reckless. Free! Yeah? Well, let's go. Fire it up, floor it. Yeah! Yeah! ...seasonal temperatures, we should reach our normal high of about 82. ...month is over, you'll get five free... Hey, Kel. Oh, hey. Um, I was just calling to check in. Want to make sure everything was okay. Debbie seemed a little upset when she left earlier, and I would hate if it had anything to do with me. Actually, it did. I know this is gonna sound crazy, but... Debbie has it in her head that you have a crush on me. That's ridiculous. Yeah, it is. Listen, I... I got to, I got to go. We'll talk later, okay? All right. Seriously, with the sighing? I just want to go home. You know, I thought going to a Halloween party would take my mind off of Navid, but it hasn't. Just wait until my date gets here, okay? Channel Marilyn; she suffered a lot in her lifetime. Marilyn never loved and lost Navid. Well, she was pretty torn up over JFK. JFK was no Navid, I know. Actually, on second thought, you can go home, Marilyn. My date's arrived. Okay, wait a second. That's Richard? He totally looks like he showers. No, that's Jamie. Hi. Hey, you. I'm glad you called. I'm glad you came. Um, my friend was just leaving. I'm gonna walk her out. I'll be right back. Okay. Okay. Um, okay, I am totally confused. I broke up with Richard. Apparently. Why? What happened? I saw Liam with this girl, looking all romantic. And I got upset and messed up, and I don't want to be upset and messed up anymore. And then it hit me. I'm never gonna get over him if I'm in a fake relationship, you know? Whereas with Jamie, I really see potential. He could be the real getting-over-Liam deal, you know? I just have to give him a shot. Even if it means studying to get into college. Well, I think you did the right thing. Yeah, me, too. Oh, you see him in shorts! Those thighs. Countries have gone to war, I know. I know. Go on. Even harder. Really smack it. It's the only way you're gonna feel better. Nice. Even harder. Watch out. Ooh. Oh. Sasha? What are you doing here? First, I want to apologize. I know I've been kind of needy lately. No, look, look, it's okay. That's not why I ended things at all. I just feel like we're in two different places in our life. Um, well, we're gonna need to find a way to get in sync. Because...
