Naomi? Got to talk to you. You decided to call the cops on the party. Your friends are mad at you. Deal with it. I spent the whole summer in summer school because of you, and you never apologized once? You know what?Screw you,dixon! Screw you,too,annie. I really don't feel like talking,okay? How about drinking? Oh,my god. Is that naked girl annie? Thank you very much. what can I say? You just caught my eye,danny. donny. donny.Right. I just didn't realize the tech club had such cuties. Well,thank you. So random question. Um,my friend and i have this bet going. She says I can't send out a text anonymously. And I was,like,"you totally can. " You totally can,right? Did konrad zuse invent the first binary programmable computer? Well,the answer's yeah. Perfect.That's great. So,would you mind just showing me so I can settle this bet once and for all? There you are! Hey,what you doing? Oh. The geeks are trying to recruit me for the tech club. dirtbag,two o'clock.Don't look. that's subtle,you guys.Nice. He better not try to talk to me again. Hey,don't worry. He won't get by us. Right,silver? Silver?Hello. I have to try to talk to him again. Me and dixon-- we have something really special. And just because I made a mistake,it doesn't mean that it's over. I just have to apologize. But you did,right? Last night. Last night he was furious. You know what?Give it a week. - Why? - Why? Because it's only been 24 hours. If he was mad last night,you're not gonna get through to him now. If you wait a week,he'll have cooled down, and he'll be a lot more receptive to your explanation. Come on. I guess it can't hurt. Still have a few spots left on the blaze! Don't miss out on your opportunity to participate in west bev's only serious journalistic enterprise. And when I say serious,I mean fun. - Hey. - What's up,boy? Silver still staring at me? Yeah.Affirmative. Yeah. Ade says she's,uh,still pretty broken up about it. Whatever,man.She's been lying to me all summer. And besides,now that it's over... I kind of feel relieved. You know,I'm free. New year,new dixon. Douche bag alert. Dude,seriously,what's your problem? Just look at him. He's been here for exactly three hours,and he's already mr.Popularity. why is it so funny? I can't believe ade lost her virginity to that guy. Look,who cares? I mean,it's not like she's into him or anything. Of course she's not into him. Why would you even say that? - Okay. - Join the blaze! We may not be popular,we may not be popular,but we've got heart! Well,lookie here.It's the skank. you have no idea how hellish I'm about to make your life. Naomi,wait. - I gotta talk to you. - Don'T.Don'T. Three months,not a word,and now you gotta talk. I don't gotta talk now. Look,my stepdad sent me away that night to this... this wilderness thing. I had no phones,no computers... poor you. That's not what I mean.I just... I'm really sorry. you're sorry? You had sex with annie,and you're sorry. Annie? Oh,great.Okay,now you're going to deny it. You know what?I walked in on you half-naked,liam... no,no,no.I... I had sex with someone,yeah,but... it wasn't annie. Then who was it? well... right.Okay. Um,your time's up. What did that loser want? Who cares? Let's just get out of here. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-Proudly Presents -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-Sync:YTET-¶¬ÃßµÄÖí 90210 Season2 Episode02 I'll never figure out this coffee machine. My old one cost 20 bucks,but at least I could make a cup of coffee. - Hi,ma. - Liam.Hi. Good.You're home. Hello,liam. This is jen clark. She came over to talk about her sister,naomi. Apparently,you caused naomi a lot of pain last year, so we both think it's best that you stay away. She's finally begun to heal. You know? - You're psychotic. - Liam,that's enough! I'm so sorry.He'S... no.No.It's okay. This is all very emotional. I completely understand.It's okay. Well,you have my word. He will stay away from naomi. That's all I care about. I mean... listen,I... I'm gonna skip the cup of coffee,sweetie,but,colleen,thank you so much. I feel better already.Really. Bye,liam. And I really miss you. I've been...I've been thinking about you nonstop. Uncle don,and,you know,it's just been so long, and I cannot wait for thanksgiving. Okay,bye. Hey! That was uncle don. He's a great guy. It's just been so long. You know. And I thought you might actually be calling dixon. - Dixon? - Yeah. No.That was... that was not dixon. Okay,it was dixon,and now I have to call him back because I just left him the weirdest message in the wor... what happened to waiting a week? Sorry we're late. All right,let's get started. Welcome,everyone,to the first meeting of blaze news uh, let me just say that I am so pumped, so pumped to see you all here. Um,we have six people signed up at the activity fair, so now we're up to 12 people,so we're moving in the right direction,right? yeah,so,now it's definitely gonna be an uphill climb. Um,last year,the staff drove blaze news into the ground. They didn't really produce news stories. They just,you kw,came up here to smoke weed. Uh,but trust me,it's gonna be different this year. And,uh,we're gonna have a lot of stuff on the tab... - Yo! - Yeah? - Can we stiok sme weed here? - No.No weed. So here's what I'm planning. Uh,a once-a-week,hard-hitting news magazine,um,peppered... peppered with,uh,personal,uh,interest stories. Um,and I-I think we can all,you know, contribute a little something to. Uh,I just made a reservation for sushi,but wow. Oh,no. What a debacle. Um,you're going to hate me. Oh,well,come-come here. Hey,hey. Oh,hello. I must have double-booked tonight. An old friend is taking me to this benefit. I... I feel sick about it. You hate me,right? Uh,a little bit. No,I don't hate you. Um,it happens. Yeah,I should probably get going anyways. I think I,uh,stood up two swimsuit models. You're so sweet,which only makes me feel worse about this whole situation. Can you just at least come in for a bit until I absolutely have to go? Sure. - Of course. - Fabulous. Oh,and we have to reschedule... - yeah. - Immediately. Well,I'll have to see if I can,uh,move some things around. Oh,here. - Could you help? - Sure. Thank you. You know,between you and me,pearls remind me of old ladies. I feel like I should be storing tissue in my bosom or something. Um,you could always not wear them. I wish. But gregory bought them for me. He's the friend I'm seeing tonight. So,anyway. - Here. - Uh,sure. - So,welcome back. - Thank you. Tell me.Did you absolutely love vietnam? I went bananas my first time there. Yeah,well,I'm guessing your vietnam and my vietnam were a little different. Bach ma national park is bach ma national park. I don't care where you sleep after seeing it. You did bach ma national park? That's a pretty gnarly hikeetting up there. What are you implying? That I don't do gnarly? That you don't do hike. Okay,fine. I helicoptered to the top. But there were plenty of sweaty hikers up there who told me all about how stp it was. Boo.Already.What a drag. Gregory,hello. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. Ah,this is my dear friend ryan. He's a teacher at naooo's schL. I double-booked tonight. I'm atrocious I know. Shall we go? Bye,ryan. Okay,we are good on the news. All we need now is another segment. You know,a lifestyle piece. Something buzz worthy. - I got a no-brainer.- Yeah? Rumor has it,there's a naked picture of the principal's daughter out there. A sex text,people. No,absolutely not. That's out of the question. Guaranteed eyeballs,dude. No,the blaze's not in the business of slinging mud. Other pitches.Think positive,people. Uh,think "only beverly hills. All right,boss man,I got one for ya. Whatcha got? New student just transferred to west bev. Apparently,he placed second in this big deal national tennis tournament. Apparently,he's going to go pro in a year. Interesting story,right? Balancing a pro tennis career with high school. Uh,do you have a name? Teddy montgomery. As in the son of spence montgomery. Major movie star,people,come on. Yeah. That's perfect! But I sussed him out,and he has some "no interview" policy. Apparently,his dad's been burned in the media a couple times. damn. Damn,damn,damn. That-that would've been perfect. Ah,that sucks. Anyway,um,any other ideas? - Anyone else? - Uh,navid,if you really want to interview teddy, I can ask him to make an exception. He might do it,since we're old friends. Really? That'd be friggin' awesome. Right? no,that-that'd be friggin' awesome.Yeah. Hello? Annie.Hi. Hi. Hi. Sorry.This... this is awkward. Uh,you called me.So... look,I-I heard a rumor tonight, and I wanted to tell you. Because... if it were me,I would want to know. What is it? Okay,apparently someone has a text of you. Like... like a naked text. - oh,my god. - It might just be a rumor... um,I-I have to go. I have to go.Bye. What? Yeah,I-I just,uh,wanted you to know the rumor,dude. Yeah,um,look,thing is,me and annie,we're-we're doing our own thing now. So,uh,I'm done dealing with her crap. All right? I'll talk to you later,man. You know,ade,I've been thinking. The teddy story's a little soft. I was thinking out covering the sex piece. What? Well,I won't mention annie's name. I'll just,you know,talk about the phenomenon in general. I mean,sex texts are big in high school. Okay,navid,you can't do that. Everyone will know it's about annie. Yeah,but we need a great story. And you have one. Teddy,remember? Come on. That's not nearly as interesting. No,but it is! Honestly,you have no idea how juicy teddy's life is. His godfather is marlon brando. Could you imagine? Baby,you can't do the sext. But teddy is amazing. Trust me.He is beyond amazing. You were compl ely out of line. You don't talk to people that way. But jen is psychotic. And I don't care about jen. I care about you. Look at me. She said naomi asked you to stay away from her. Is that true? Well,okay,then.That's it. When someone says they are done with you, you've gotta believe them. Remember what they taught you in utah. Stay away from people who trigger bad behavior. People like naomi. I know. I know. Just stick to the plan,honey. You need structure. Downtime is when you get into trouble. You're still going to join a team,right? Good. You'll make some friends,like you had on long island. It's not going to be the same. So here's a question. How hard could it possibly be to make a flower garden symmetrical? - Hi,honey. - Ma hey,baby. Liam. So I asked the gardener to trim back the roses a little bit,right? I get there and the left side is about six inches wider than the right. Now could you imagine what would happen if I did that kind of shoddy work in my business? hey,maybe that's the answer. What I'm going to do,is I'm going to invite the gardener's wife over for a little plastic surgery, and I'm going to give her one big beautiful d-cup and tiny little a-cup. That's a good idea-- bully the gardener. Hey. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the whole idea of my dropping $20,000 so you could sleep in a tent was so that you would lose the attitude problem. Just saying. That's enough,liam. Help me,honey. walking on thin ice,young man. You know,you're very lucky I didn't call the police and tell them how you stole my patient's edit cards last year. Liam knows,and he's grateful. He better be grateful. 'Cause if I see a sign of any bad behavior from you,I'm makg the call, young man,and trust me,juvie is nothing at all like you're little mamby-pamby "let's get in touch with our feelings" wilderness crap. You understand me? You have to understand,this is really important to navid. Okay,the blaze,it's everything. And your life is so interesting. why are you smiling at me like that? Okay,teddy,mmm. Will you do it for me? Please. Pretty please. Of course. wasn't ever a question. I just enjoy watching beautiful girls beg. You're evil. Oh,come on.Don't act surprised. You of all people know me. Yeah,well,I thought you might've grown up after a few years. What's the fun in that? although,rumor has it you've grown up. Whatever could you be talking about? Come on,ade. What's been going on? Mm,not much. give or take a pregnancy. That's intense,ade. Was the baby navid's? No. But he was really great through it. I mean,he actually wanted to marry me and help raise her. It was a her. Um,but in the end,I just wasn't ready. What? Why do you look so serious? You're never serious. Are you okay now? Me?Yeah. I'M...good. I'm on track. Good. 'Cause you're pretty important to me,you know? - Hey. - Hey. Hey,buddy. So it looks like I'm doing my first interview. Yeah? Uh,yay. Uh,that's-that's great. Ah,denny! - Donny. - Right.Sorry. So listen,you were going to show me how to send an anonymous text. I'd love to. How about over dinner? Tonight? Um,I have plans. Lunch tomorrow? Off campus? The farther the better. I gotta go edit,but I'll meet you ameet you at 12:15,okay? Don't forget. I'll meet you in the cafeteria? Oh,actually,the media lab. - Hi,naomi. - Bye,naomi. Oh,he seems stressed. It's the blaze. He just wants it to be a success so bad. He's even considering doing a segment on that supposed text,sext,that's going around. You've heard of it,right? Of annie? Mmm.Yeah.He should run the story. Come on,naomi. Whatever annie did,she doesn't deserve that. I can't believe someone would take a picture of it and send it around. How evil is that? Your ball. come on,buddy. What's the deal?Where's your head at? Just,uh,girl trouble. Jen? I'm playing with fire,man. Cardinal rule-- don't like her more than she likes you. That,my friend,is why you're still single. Trust me-- I like deb way more than she likes me. Yeah,I know that's true. What?What? Nothing. It's your ball,man. All right,here's the thing with jen. I don't have a chance. I mean,the other guys she's dating,they're seriously loaded. Well,did you tell her about your pension plan? Trust me,in about 40 years when those benefits start kicking in, she's gonna be happy you're a teacher. Get out. Make me feel worse. Not helping,huh? Hey,just stay in the game. As long as you're in it,you've got a chance to win it. Man,she is worth winning. Speaking of winning... kobe for the three. I don't think so! Not in my house. Sorry. Kobe got robbed there. Is it true? Oh,hey. Is it true? Did you take pictures? How could you? Look,this is not... it's not going to be a big deal. Not a big deal?! What the hell? Look,I'm not the one you should worry about here,okay? Talk to your friend naomi. She's got a copy of the picture,too. all right,you little grommets,listen up. Everybody trying out for the surf team,there are five heats. Top three from each are gonna move on to the next wave. Any questions? All right. You four,I want to see you be totally aggro out there. Let's go.Let's do it. so,uh,y are you out here? I mean,aren't you supposed to be like roger federer or something? More like nadal. but surfing's my first love,man. It's the way I blow off steam. Hey,can i borrow some wax? I didn't know you surfed. I used to. Jones beach back in long island. Long island.Wait.New york? - You're from new york? - Yeah. How did I not know? I'm-I'm from new york. I mean,I-I moved when I was eight,but still... no,man,that qualifies. Oh,boy. Here it comes. The whole,we're bros 'cause we're both from new york thing. - Clearly from L.A ? - Yeah. And what is that supposed to mean? Nothing.I could just tell. You and ryan hacrestave that certain something. Certain something. I got to admit,I didn't take you as a team kind of guy. Well,I'm not. But an idle liam makes for very bad things. All right,you five. In the water.Let's go.Let's go! Let's go do it. Hey. Just so you know,I didn't sleep with your sister. I don't want to talk about annie today. Me and her-- we're-we're like two different people,all right? That's as fast as you can go? That,my friend,is why I love californ-I-A. Vietnamese for pearls liam? You have to ta to naomi. You have to tell her that we didn't have sex. I did. You told her that it wasn't me? Yeah. I told her.She didn't believe me. Well,did you tell her who it was? Why not?Why wouldn't you? I'm sorry.It's-it's complicated. It's not complicated. How-how is it complicated,liam? You and i didn't have sex,and- and you had sex with somebody else, and if you don't tell naomi the truth, she is going to ruin my life,liam. I got to go. Fiand ve,four,three,two. I'm here today with teddy montgomery, son of two-time academy award winner,spence montgomery. How you doing today,teddy? Not too bad.Cool. - So,let's dive right in. - All right. Word has it that you're a pretty amazing tennis player. According to my notes,you ranked second at nationals? Well,I was lucky. I got a good draw. yeah. Gotcha. uh,let-let me ask you this. Um,you have to be pretty arrogant to be an athlete,right? Do you bring that arrogance to your personal life? Oh,well... do you feel guilty about the fact that your last name has opened so many doors? How does it feel to know that you'll never be as successful as your father? Yeah,you've lived a pretty charmed life,haven't you? Anything bad ever happen to you? What?No regrets? So,you-you think you're perfect? So,here's a question that I think has been on everyone's mind. Why did you turn to beverly hills? Why not stay at exeter? I missed california. I mean,there's nothing quite like it. Interesting. So it has nothing to do with the fact that you were kicked out after being caught with two naked girls in your room? Or maybe you forgot. Maybe you were so epsy sleing around that you can't remember who you did or didn't sleep with. I didn't forget.I just... I don't kiss and tell. Please don't send out that picture. It's gonna ruin my life. Naomi,please. Erase it. I'll-I'll do anything that you want. Anything. You know what I want? I want you to stop lying. I'm not lying. Admit that you had sex with liam. I didn'T. Admit it. I... if I admit it,will you just erase the picture? I just want you to admit it. Fine. Fine.I did it. I had sex with liam,okay? Are you happy? Please.Just don't send it. What the hell was that? You just attacked him. What?I'm a journalist. Journalists don't pull punches. Yeah,well,they also don't attack someone just because that person used to date their girlfriend. You're paranoid. Really? Hey,teddy? Can I catch a ride to the beach with you? Sure thing. Awesome. Thank you. Go,dixon! and everybody else. All right,ladies,tone down the enthusiasm. You're making a scene. What if I told you I'm having doubts about whether annie slept with liam? I would say that's great. That's great. Relax,okay?I said I'm having doubts. She's not in the clear yet. okay,I got to say,dixon's pretty good. He's gonna make the team. And when he does,he's gonna be in a great mood, which means it's gonna be an awesome time to talk to him. Clearly we have to keep her away from him tonight. Uh,clearly. What are you talking about?Of course you made the team. I wiped out twice. Whatever,man.You know? Who cares. All right,everybody,listen up. Here's the team. Yes! We all made it,man!We all made it. - Great! - Yes! I wanted to thank you for the beautiful necklace. - does this lock? - Oh,yeah. glad you like it. hey. Dude,silver called me again. I don't know what else to do. I already told her it's over. Guess she's just having a hard time believing it. When someone says they're done... you got to believe them. Wait.You talking about naomi? 'Cause,uh,that's different. naomi is not over you. What do you mean? Ade told me,but you didn't hear it from me. Ade will kill me. Actually,she already wants to kill me,but what the hell. No,man.She's wrong. Naomi told me to leave her alone. Come on,you know girls never really say what they mean. They're always,like,double-,riple-talking. Yeah,they're not dudes. You know,we're very straightforward. - Yeah. - Amen. I mean,girls,they're all,like,"hey,yeah,babe "do you want japanese or chinese food? 'Cause,you know,I really don't care? And then,you're,like,"yeah,let's get me japanese," and then,they're pissed,'cause they wanted chinese. Why they didn't just say chinese-- dude,I'll... I'll never know. So,if naomi says she wants me to leave her alone... she wants some chinese food,kid. I mean,she wants you to try harder. Chinese food? Chinese food. Silver,are you okay? come on. Let's go,all right? Come on,come on,silver. Come on,come on.it's okay. Ade. Stay.I'll take her home. Come on. Come on. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Look,uh,I was a jerk. I ambushed teddy because he was your ex. And it was a stupid way to handle it. I should have just been up front and told you that I didn't want the two of you to be friends. That's your apology? I-I said I acted like a jerk. Then why are you still acting like one? I'm not.I'm just being honest with you. What's the big deal? It's not like the two of you talked the past few years? Yeah,well,we go to tool schnow. I-I know.And you could say... you could say "hey" or whatever... oh,thank you.Thanks. Ade,it's not like he's some random dude. He's-he's the guy you lost your virginity to. I think it's only fair for me to ask y not to talk to him if it makes me uncomfortable. You know what makes me uncomfortable? The fact that you can't trust me. Ade. Could-could you... ade,wait. I gotta talk to naomi. I'm so sorry. She's not here. That's her car. Aren't you the little detective. Listen,why don'you give me a message and I will be sure to pass it on. Yeah,whatever. I'll just talk to her at school. Just what are you planning on talking to her about? I didn't want to tell naomi what happened between us because I didn't want to hurt her even more. I thought there was no point,because she was done with me. But she's not. And she needs to know the truth. And when I deny it? Who do you think she's going to believe? The person who she relies on most in this world, or you,the person who broke her heart? You're not going to lose your temper,re you? Because your mom says if you do, You're going straight to juvie. You bitch. You're unbelievable! Jeffrey didn't think that you were ready to come home after the wilderness program. Like a fool,I said you were. I am. You punched her door! Why the hell did you go over there in the first place? Go over where? I was boiling water and tripped. This idiot tried to catch the pot. Burned himself good. - I'll take a look at it. - No. Nah.He's be fine. He just needs to think before he does stupid stuff. Okay.All right. I will. Od.'Cause next time,you're on your own. Hey. naomi,hi. How's silver doing? she'll be okay. Oh,good. I saw your teacher earlier. Ew,ryan? what's the deal with that? Are you,like,seriously into him or something? No. Of course I am not "likseriously into him. " Thank you. Same time tomorrow. Look,here's the thing. L.A.Is a very small town. And if a girl isn't careful,she can get labeled a gold digger. And that,my dear,is something that I can't afford. Scares the rich men right off. okay. Keeping an economically,you know, challenged teacher around protec from that pesky little label. Oh,you're just using him.Thank god. Of course I am using him. The other night,I accidentally double-booked a date with ryan and with gregory. Gregory is one of those paranoid billionaires who thinks that women are only after his money. Of course,we are. You should've seen the look on gregory's face when he saw ryan walking back to his crappy little car. Suddenly I was mother teresa. you're brilliant. Thank you,darling. So,did you figure out how to send out that text? Yes! Finally. After a two hour lunch at ihop. So,did you send the text? no. I don't know.It just... it's pretty evil. I would ruin her life. She ruined yours. Yeah. If she slept with liam. If? Something's just not adding up. I mean,annie's been saying all along it wast heR. But then liam said it wasn't her. Well,did he say who it was? Well,no. But maybe if I just ask him again he'll... what? Nothing. What? Nothing! You're just... so sweet. So optimistic. I remember,before we all accepted daddy's affairs as par for the course, there was this incident. Mommy had found some sort of proof that daddy was sleeping with florence canold. But despite all the evidence,she didn't want to believe it. Everyone was talking about what a fool our mother was. But as I grew up, I realized she wasn't a fool. She was... just optimistic. Like you. In fact,every day you remind me more and more of our mother. Naomi,what are you doing? I'm sending out that text. The evidence was all there. I don't know what I was thinking. Oh,my god,did you see the principal's daughter naked? nice rack. Annie,I'm here for you,okay? Thank you. For-for warning me.I never thanked you for warning me. - It's okay. - No. No,it's not okay. You were being nice and a friend. I don't know why I never even called you back when you called me this summer and... annie. It's okay. It's going to be okay.
