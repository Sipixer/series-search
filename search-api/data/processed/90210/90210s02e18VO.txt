- What are you talking about? - You accidentally ran over my Uncle. I didn't know Joe myself. We're a band. All for one. And all that crap. We do it together or we don't do it at all. - Hi. Laurel Cooper. - You're a music producer? - And I'm interested in signing you. - I can't wait to tell the band. I'm not interested in the band. I'm only interested in you. Mom! - I know you're still into Liam. - What are you talking about? - I'm with Dixon now. - You're not really dating. You have no idea what you're talking about - I'm kicking you off The Blaze. - No! What do you want? I'll do anything. Please, I'll do anything. - Are you offering to sleep with me? - What? Because that would be completely inappropriate. You're off The Blaze. I can't believe you're taking his side. He said if I wanted back on The Blaze, I had to sleep with him. What?! - You're a piece of garbage. - Did you hear about Liam? - Apparently he attacked Mr. Cannon. - You can't do this. - This doesn't concern you. - Yes, it does. Liam did this because Mr. Cannon sexually harassed me. Do I have to sign something? Like, a contract? Yeah, but the lawyers will get into all that. You and me, we'll just focus on the music. Sounds great. There's just one thing. I feel really guilty about leaving the band. Is there any reason why I can't just play with them in my spare time? Spare time? I don't think you fully grasp where your life is heAded. Cutting an album, touring, promoting... Your plate is about to get very full. Especially if you insist on sticking with High School. I'm just messing with you. Listen. I'm throwing a party here for some industry folks. You should come. It'll give you a taste of your new life. My new life? Once the touring starts, you'll be out every night. Sleeping in different cities, going to the craziest parties in the world. It's going to be an amazing ride. Wish you could have seen that jellyfish. It was bigger than my board. Stings like a bitch. I bet. But did you have to pee on your foot in front of those girls? You're right, I should've let you do it. I know I owe you that money to pay your dad's bookie... Whenever you get a chance. Could we hold off a bit? The Lakers are playing San Antonio at home, and I know they're not going to lose. Just want to put some real money on it. Not a problem. There's my lady. How you doing, baby? Got to go pee on my foot again. See you guys. Interesting. Homeboy definitely got some quirks to him. No kidding. Teddy's gone. You plan on keeping your arm around me all day or you gonna let me go eat my fries before they get soggy? Later. I had a really good time tonight. The night is just starting, baby. Hi. Easy with the PDA. Thanks. Where were we? Chillax, my friend. Ivy's a big girl. I'll see you later? How's your piece coming? Not too bad. Things going well with you and Adrianna? Yeah. Thanks for asking. Great. Excellent. I'm glad to hear it. It must be pretty tough to get all this work done, now that you're in a serious relationship. Not really. Awesome. Because relationships, they can be so time-consuming. I always felt that way about Ade. That is, before she started dating you, of course. Those events were completely unrelated. Right? Or were they related? - I'm not really following. - Did I make Adrianna gay? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to laugh. That's not really how it works. You didn't have anything to do with it. I didn't. Adrianna just fell for me. People fall for each other all the time. Yeah, they do. Not that I'm worried or anything. I'm pretty confident with my skills. Between the sheets Gotcha. What I wanted to say is, she's a really good person. Just make sure you take care of her. I know she is. I will. I got to run to class. See you later, champ. So, you seemed pretty interested in Gia and Ade's relationship. What's up with that? That was just natural curiosity, That's all. Are you sure that's all that was? What else would it be? See you in a bit. All right. Keep your eyes open, Silver. I'm looking for a car that represents a whole new chapter in my life. Something that says freedom. Thelma and Louise minus the driving off the cliff part. Something... Like that. Hello, gorgeous. And the dream dies. The insurance money I got won't even come close. You could sell a kidney. - Might be worth it. - Yeah, maybe. At the very least, we should take it for a joy ride. Keep my kidney and get a small taste of freedom. Best of both worlds. She's a beauty, ain't she? Let me grab the keys. I'd love to take you for a spin. Actually, is there any way that we could take it out ourselves? That's against company policy. Next time you go car shopping, bring a parent. So much for the joy ride. Would Thelma and Louise take no for an answer? I know how upset you must be. And I want you to know that I am taking your accusations very seriously. I talked to the school board and there's going to be a hearing in a few days. What? I don't want a hearing. I don't want to press charges. I'm the victim. It's my choice, right? No, it's not. Once a student raises these concerns about a teacher, it becomes a public safety issue and that's why Mr. Cannon has been put on paid leave until the hearing. Principal Wilson... I'm serious. I just want to call this whole thing off. - I don't think he's gonna do it again. - We can't take that chance. I know this is difficult for you. But you go in there, you tell the truth, and everything's gonna be fine. Peach Pit team Season 02 episode 18 Another Another Chance It's my mom. Like, the fifth time today. She just doesn't get it. I'm never going back to that house. It's the last place in the world I want to be. I know this Mr. Cannon thing is... Scary. But you don't have anything to worry about. I do have something to worry about, Liam. There's something I have to tell you. We just heard. Sleazebag. - What did you hear? - I swear, if I see Mr. Cannon, you better hold me back. I may not look like a bruiser but I can if need be. - How did you hear about it? - They were talking in history class. What?! You're doing the right thing. Cannon is a jerk. I hope he never teaches again. You okay? Not really. I don't want to talk about it. Come on. It's me here. What's going on? Don't say anything to anybody yet, You know that record producer Laurel? She wants to make an album with me. So a huge record producer wants to make your dreams come true? Now I get the whole glum thing. It means ditching the band. They'll probably be really upset. But the thing is I think any one of them would jump on this if they were in your shoes. Maybe. But it's not just that. - What is it then? - Navid, come on. You of all people should know. You didn't think I was ready to get back into the acting thing. And as scary as that world is, the music industry is a hundred times worse. I don't know if I can handle it. You can. Would the old Adrianna have taken this decision so seriously? - Probably not. - Exactly. The fact that you're thinking about it, it's proof that you changed. Thanks. Do you mind not mentioning this to anybody yet? I kinda want to break it to the band myself. Sure, of course. The Blaze is gonna be way less lame with your intro music. Seriously, it sounds dope. Thank you. Deejaying is a passion of mine. Show me how you do this. Deejaying is a very, very important job. Is that true? Say you're doing a party. And there's a couple, and they're dancing. And it's getting hotter by the minute. And they could be about to have that very, very first kiss. If you play the wrong song... You could ruin the whole moment. I love Bob Marley! - I knew you had taste. - There's something about his music. You're bumming or sad about something, you turn him on he cheers you up. It's like flipping a switch. Sorry to interrupt. I though Naomi might be in here. I'll see you guys later. Where were we? I just don't get what he's doing with her. It's like... Open your eyes. How the hell does Naomi walk in these things? Keep your eyes on the prize. We are gonna take that car for a ride today. Hopefully before I get strangled by my own boobs. Explain to me again why we're doing this. I had a hard year. With Jasper and everything, I just want something that signifies a new beginning, freedom. I know this sounds crazy. You're gonna get your Thelma & Louis freedom ride. This push-up bra did not get worn in vain. Are you ladies interested in a used car? We prefer to call them "previously owned automobiles." My daddy said I can have any car I want for my birthday, and I want this one. This is an excellent choice. Let me go grab the keys for you. I'd be happy to take you ladies for a spin. Actually, we were hoping to sample the auto without dealer supervision. As in alone? - I'm sorry. It's against company... - Company policy. No problem. Let's go to that place in Beverly hills. This cash is burning a hole in my pocket. Ladies... Let me go get the keys for you. You're too kind. The kindest. Don't you love it?! Don't you feel free?! I do. I feel free! And lost. Do you have any idea where we are? Actually, no. No bet at all. I guess we just keep driving till we figure it out. Are you all right? I'm sorry. I just don't feel well all of a sudden. Can we trade seats? I don't think I can drive anymore. Sure. Why are you doing this? You know nothing happened. I have a wife. Why are you ruining my life? What the hell are you doing? Come on. Don't let that guy get in your head. - I'm ruining his life. - No, you're not. He ruined his life when he harassed you. I know this is hard, but you can do it. I believe in you. I'm here for you and I love you and I know that you're a strong person. I promise you that when you get done... You just said you loved me. I did... And I do. I love you, too. You can do this. I'm gonna be right here waiting for you when it's over. Unbelievable! I'm guessing not a good unbelievable. Adrianna quit the band. Can you believe she screwed us like that?! It sucks, but it was a pretty big opportunity. It's not like she could've passed it up. You'll find another singer. Wait a minute. You knew about this? Why didn't you tell me? I couldn't. Ade asked me not to say anything. I guess I know where your loyalty lies. Whatever. I'm out of here. As we all know, these are very serious accusations, And we want to hear from you both about what happened. Naomi, why don't you start? I went to Mr. Cannon's classroom 'cause he wanted to speak to me, and I was alone with him. And... And... Nothing happened. - I lied. - What? I don't even know what to say to you. You almost ruined that man's life. I'll talk to the school board to determine your punishment, but trust me, there will be severe consequences. I don't get it. How could you do that? I just... Never thought it'd go this far. Go on. Tell me you love me. - What? - Or wait for the news. What news? My mom is throwing one of those big music industry parties at our house, and guess who I convinced her to hire as the deejay? - You! - Me? - A paid gig? - A paid gig. For real? Wait. Your mom could hire anybody that she wants. Why would she hire me? It might've helped that I told her you were one of the hottest new deejays and that you just spun Rob Pattinson's birthday party. I'm don't know where I came up with that one. Thank you. That was really cool of you. - I owe you one. - You do. And I was thinking What better way to say thank you than to break up? There is no way Liam's gonna want to stay with Naomi after lie-fest 2010, so maybe I have a chance. So we kinda gotta speed up the fake breakup. I don't think that's a good idea. Who initiated the breakup? 'cause I certainly don't want to be dumped. Neither do I. Fine, I'll be dumped. But don't say I was clingy or anything. Say... Say I had a wandering eye. This stuff is top shelf. Got a guy who grows it in his backyard in Topanga. I probably shouldn't. I'm not going to tell on you. I'm one of those people who tends to get a little carried away with that stuff. At least, I did. I had a bit of a problem with it in college, and by bit of a problem, I mean they used to call me "wake'n bake." So it's probably best I don't start up again. Suit yourself, wake'n bake. It's all good. What if Ivy walks in? She is my student. I taught Ivy to roll joints for me when she was 13. Don't worry. She hates these industry soirees. All right, what the hell. Don't say I didn't warn you. I am drowning in a sea of vintage. I don't get it. When we talked, this professional music thing wasn't a good idea. - I thought you didn't wanna do it. - I talked to Navid and he made me feel a lot better. Talked to Navid? Why didn't you tell me that before? - I didn't think it was a big deal. - Seems like a big deal that you'd rather take your ex-boyfriend's advice. Gia, come on. There's nothing going on between me and Navid, I promise. He just knows me really well. - And I don't? - Don't twist my words. Gia, stop it. You're the one I want to go to the party with. But, I really don't think I should go. Because I talked to Navid? Not that. I have my own sobriety to worry about. And I just don't think it's a good idea to to go. For you or me. But I already told you that. But apparently, you'd rather take your ex-boyfriend's advice. 'Cause he's not so judge-y. He actually believes in me. - Great, then take him to the party. - Maybe I will. It'll be more fun. Screw you. I heard what happened with Naomi, and I just want to say I'm sorry. Thanks. But at least now you know what kind of person she is. What are you talking about? She's selfish and manipulative... Whatever. It's over now. - So at least you can move on. - Move on with you? Get it through your head, Ivy... We're never gonna happen. The cars, the cars... That was a band. Do you remember the video where the guy was walking on water? I was like, dude, you're totally walking on water. How did they do that? I'm really glad I met you. You're pretty fun when you loosen up. Funny that you should say loose, 'cause I'm feeling a little loose, actually. Particularly in the hip region. I don't know if you noticed this was starting to happen. A little shimmy. Sometimes I do this move. This happens. Or... A little shimmy. Maybe you want some Booty. A little Booty right there? See that? I do a little Booty. That looks just like one of my students. Oh, my God, that's Dixon. - What is he doing here? - He's a friend of my daughter. I hired him to deejay the party. Stop. No. He's my student. This is terrible. This is a disaster. Don't get your panties in a bunch, Ryan. My panties? My panties are very much bunched right now. As they should be. Why are you laughing? What is she doing here? I'm representing her. - Don't wave. - You should hear that girl sing. I have, at school, where I teach. What's wrong with you? Why wouldn't you tell me they were coming when I asked you specifically? You only wanted to know whether Ivy was coming. You didn't ask about anybody else. You should have warned me. I'm out of here. Hey, I got your text to come over. What is all this? It's our cotillion. I messed up when I was nine. And stepped on your foot during the waltz. And you gave me another chance. And I messed up again with Ade. But, Lila, you should know that my loyalty lies with you. So, will you give me another... another chance? I'll try not to mess up again. Adrianna's first album is going to be very ethereal. Think Sia meets Inara George with a hint of Kate Nash on a rainy day. Right? Anyway, sorry to steal her away, but there's a whole bunch of people I need this girl to meet. What's going on? You seem to be a little elsewhere right now. I'm fine. Come on. I had a fight with my girlfriend. It was pretty bad, and... I think it was my fault. I don't know... I wasn't being very sensitive, and I really need to apologize. So, what the hell are you doing here? I thought I had to come. I thought this was important for my career. Let me give you some advice. Not as a record producer, but as your friend. Screw this party. Follow your heart. This industry is going to push you, so you've got to push back. Don't let us make decisions for you. Otherwise, you'll be eaten up and swallowed whole. - What are you doing here? - I'm so sorry. I should have been more understanding about how you felt about the party and me going to the party. I really think I can handle this. But I should have talked that out with you, not Navid. No kidding. - This isn't a good time. - Gia, come on. I totally respect why you didn't want to go, and you don't ever have to go if you don't want to. As long as you're there for me when I get back. You cheated on me. How could you do that? You were throwing your relationship with Navid in my face. And I was upset and insecure and... I bumped into Alexa and we started talking, and it just happened. I screwed up, okay? And I'm really sorry. I'm sorry, too. I don't know what to say. I screwed up dozens of times in my life. This, by far, is the dumbest thing I've ever done. And I regret it. You have no idea how much I regret it. I was so angry at Mr. Cannon, and no one was on my side, so I... I made it up. It wasn't supposed to go anywhere, but then you found out and you got so upset. Before I could even come clean, things just got completely out of control. Wait. - Where are you going? - Back to my mom's. But you said that was the last place in the world you wanted to be. I definitely don't want to be here. Thanks again for hooking me up with this job. - Don't worry... - It was so dope. Seriously. Some important-looking guy in a suit even gave me his business card. Rad. Better believe I'm googling him when I get home. - You okay? - I don't really want to get into it. Come on. Otherwise, I'm going to think it's something I did. Well, it wasn't, so... You say that, but I'm gonna still take it pretty personally. Despite my... Roguish good looks and easy charm, I'm still pretty insecure. - Is that so? - Yeah. Tragedy of my life. Come on. It's just... I saw Liam and... I thought he'd be happy to see me, after everything that's happened with Naomi, but... nope. That was a mistake. He basically told me it was never gonna happen. Then he's an idiot. Cause you're amazing, Ivy. - You don't have to say that. - I know I don't. But, on a brighter note, now I can actually move on cause I am totally over that guy. I'm happy to hear that. - Thank you. - No. I'm really happy to hear that. Cause I like you, Ivy. So... Any chance you'll let your fake ex-boyfriend take you out on a real date? Why not? Right? Cool. Cool. Can I get a chai latte, please? Thanks. Excuse me. Shouldn't you be sharing shopping tips with Lady Gaga right now? I left the party early. I'm just writing a song. - What's it about? - It's... It's kind of about being cheated on. I just caught Gia with her ex. - I'm really sorry. - It happens. It sucks, but you survive. You did, right? Yeah, you survive. What? Now, can I just say, though, that... I'm really proud of you. Just seeing you here alone, drinking your coffee, writing your songs... seems like such an undramatic way to handle all this. Which does prove my earlier point. You are different. Now, you can handle all this. Easy. Do you want to sit and have some coffee with me? Or on you on your way to see the president or something? Obama can wait. Can I see what you're writing? No judgments, though. It's early. Okay? Okay. No judgments. Promise. What's the title? You're still here? Couldn't exactly drive home in my condition. Hell, I couldn't even find my car. I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance about Dixon and Adrianna coming to the party. To be honest, I didn't... I didn't even think about it. You need to understand I'm not exactly a consequences oriented kind of woman. Never have been. And if you don't want to hang out with me because of that, I get it. I'm a big boy. And I don't need a babysitter. Good. Cause I've never been any good at that either. Can I have some of that? We salute you. Dad? - Wwhen did you get out? - Not that long ago. Between you and me, prison's not all it's cracked up to be. As soon as I heard you're in California, I took the first bus out here. I missed you, kid. Look at you. I'm a terrible person. You're not. I am. I don't even know how this happened. I said one thing. And it... spiraled completely out of control. And then... Before you could say anything, or come forward, the secret just took on a life of its own. And became this nightmare that you couldn't wake up from.
