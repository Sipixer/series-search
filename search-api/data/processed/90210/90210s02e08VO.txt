That's not a dude buddy. Ivy come here. What do you care who I make out with? You got a boyfriend. Kiss whoever you want. We need to break up. Maybe for a while we just keep our relationship on the down low? Relationship? Noami will never believe the we slept together. I got talk to you. I think it's best that we just end things. I'm pregnant. I can't take it anymore. I can't. I can't live like this. God you're beautiful. - Shut up. - You are, you're a damn good actress too. I guess it's like, I looked in your eyes, I see something. Something, I don't know, full of pain but it's definitely real. - It's probably because of my contacts. - You shouldn't joke about your talent. Unless you think it's all a joke? Me? My movie? Of course not. I think your movie's amazing. Honestly, you are increditably talented. I can't do it without you. You're my muse. Guys, get a room. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't realize there was a Blaze meeting. I don't mean to kick you out, if you wanna finish what you're doing. We're leaving. Who are we to get in the way of Woodward and Bernstein right? Blazers, listen up. I know that you're all excited about the college edition but I want to push in light of what just happend, over at Malibu Canyon High. I'm sure you guys already heard, but a sophomore overdosed last weekend. I wanna do a piece, about the abuse of prescriptions drugs in high school. - What do you think? - Good story but you just let your best sources walked out the door. I have this ex-friend, Jenny. She used to play soccer, she was gonna be the next Mia Hamm Now she's a total junkie, strung out, screwed up. The whole delightful package. Guess who her dealer is? - Are you sure? - 100%. Those waves were sick this morning. I saw you wipe out at the end there enjoy a nice Neptune's cocktail? That was a serious wave. All I know it was at least 3 inches high. - You got a measuring stick? - Yeah, in his pants. - Suck it Sullivan. - Whatever. Seriously, you were spitting up so much salt water I wanted to paddle over there and burp you like a baby 3 inches, it was like... Take a gander at Mr. Krinsky's pants. His belt is, like, nestled up into his armpit. The idea that Mr. Krinsky is married mystifies me. And his wife is hot! Saw the picture on his desk. Unless, of course, the picture came with the frame. I bet all the pictures came with the frame. That golden retriever is so not his. Talking about spitting up salt water... - You're dead. - I love this girl. What's up guys? Sit, take a load of. - No I was just going to the Blaze. - I'm outta here. I gotta go file a report in the PO about my damaged tongue. I guess I'll sit. That was good. That was what? 10% less awkward than the last Navid-Teddy encounter. That guy is a tool, and a jerk. Doing alright? I'm fine. Just working away, a lot of homework, busy busy busy. Especially if I stop for a little moment I remember how my heart broke up into thousands of piece. Break-ups are the worst. Sorry, man. You're better off single. Girls are nothing but trouble and drama. Not you, you don't count, you're not really a girl. Door's open. The picture of domesticity. Martha Stewart better watch her back. I'm younger, I'm cuter, and I do not have a prison record. You cooked a chicken? That is where she has the advantage. In the cooking department, I tried to cook a chicken. We'll see. And, I rented the "Maltese Falcon". So we can eat and then watch TV or we can eat while watching tv. I don't want to eat, I just want to talk. You're pregnant. I know. You think that I don't know that? I don't know. You told me almost a week ago and I've been here almost every night. And all we done is to eat or watch television. - We haven't talked at all. - I know. Sometimes all I want to do is, is not thinking about it. And be with you. Yeah, but there's no time left to talk. There's a time limit on things like this. Time limit? You mean... Are you saying I should get an abortion? Let's just be real. I'm a junior in high school... And you are a grown woman with a career and a life. We're not even dating. I'm gonna keep the baby. Our baby. Is your school lunch safe? How safe is your school lunch? Your school lunch... Is it safe... or is it unsafe? I'm sorry... Please. Please, forgive me. You cheated on me. You broke up with me so you could go out with Teddy. He doesn't want to go out with you anymore? You come back to me expecting me to take you back. And you weren't gonna tell me the truth. You were gonna lie to me and pretend like nothing happened with him. After I stood by you, you treat me like this? I'm done. These bloody shoes! And I mean that literally. Male shoe designers are absolute sadists. If you haven't walked a mile in my shoes, then you shouldn't be designing them. - I'm gonna put that on my gravestone. - It's actually not a great... Oh, my goodness, there's... a woman in your apartment. I know. This is Ramona. Ramona, this is... Jen. How you doing? I'm... You... two are on a date. How silly of me. I'll just get out of your hair. - Where did you two meet? - I was his bartender at the Silverlake. Silverlake, right. Apparently, there's a whole world east of La Brea. I have to run. You two have a lovely evening. Would you like some more wine? Because I know I would. Hey, you guys... Sorry I'm late... surf practice ran long today. I don't see how that affects you. Talked to your coach today. He kicked you off 'cause you missed too many practices. Why is that? - <i>Will you come? We need to talk!</i> - Where were you? - <i>I need you! I feel so alone</i> - Answer your father. Put your phone down when I'm talking to you. Fine! You guys want to know what's going on? I got a girl pregnant. Peach Pit Team Season 02 episode 08 Women's Intuition - Look... - Don't. Don't talk. I don't know what to say. You didn't just get a girl pregnant, you got a woman pregnant. An adult woman you have been secretly dating. You lied to her. - You lied to us. - I know. I screwed up. I get it. Do you? Do you get it? Because if she has this baby, you're gonna be a father. You will have brought a child into this world. Your life as you know it will be over. That's not true. Everything doesn't have to change. Dad had a kid when he was a teenager. - I made a mistake. - And so did I. I don't even know how this happened. We were safe almost every time. Almost? You used protection almost every time? - Yeah... - Don't... Don't you say another word. That her? She says she's having cramps. - I don't know what I'm supposed to do. - Get your coat. You're going over there. You came. - And you brought... - His mother. Honestly I'm feeling much better. I didn't mean to freak you guys out. The cramps are completely gone. Maybe it was something I ate... You should just sit. If you give me the name of your doctor, I'll just call make sure everything's okay. Do you not have a doctor? It's Dr. Alderman. But honestly, I'm fine. You don't have to call. I think if I get a little rest, I should be fine. That's good. Mom, why don't we just let Sasha rest? Of course, and I'm glad that you're feeling better. If you don't mind me asking, how far along are you? - A month. - And you've been to your doctor? Totally. I did all the tests and the whole sonogram and everything is great. The baby looks great. Dixon did mention that you were thinking about keeping it. Are you sure about that decision? That really isn't any of your business. I just want to discuss... What I do or don't do with this baby is a private matter between me and Dixon. I need some rest. And you need to leave. We'll talk later? You take care of yourself, Sasha. Come here a minute. Guess who got an honorable mention in the city-wide essay contest? You. They give everyone who entered an honorable mention? They didn't. It's a real accomplishment. I'm not saying you just won the World Series of Poker, but it's something. I'm not going to give you a high-five, if that's what you're hoping. - Quick. Nobody's looking. - Get out of here. - Down low? - You're a freak. Nice. You're getting better. You got two in a row there. I'm learning. You better back off, before I learn with your nut sack. I almost forgot, I heard back from my mom. We are on the list for the N.E.R.D. party. - Can't wait. It's gonna be cool. - My mom totally hooked us up. Hollywood parties aren't my thing. I'll see you guys at the beach. Later. - I'll miss you. - I'll call you when I'm on my way home. Can I talk to you? Sure. This might be none of my business, but I just heard something pretty messed up and I want you to know right away. Jasper's a drug dealer. What? What are you talking about? I have a friend whose friend's dealer is Jasper. - Someone who knows someone. - I know how it sounds, but my friend is trustworthy. So am I. There's no reason for me to lie. I'm telling you this because we used to be friends. And I'm worried about you. Don't be. Can I get a French 75? You're Ryan's friend. Rachel? Ramona. We met the other night, right? How funny. I found myself in the neighborhood, and I remembered hearing about this place, so I thought I'd come in and check out the scene. It's funny, I didn't recognize you. You're much older looking close up. Sorry. That didn't come out right. That's all right. I guess I could look pretty young from a distance. Could I get that French 75, or are you awfully busy? Sorry. We don't have any champagne. Tell you what... sweetie, why don't you just grab me a glass of water. Tell me about yourself. What are you... an aspiring actress? A model? You're definitely not a model. Maybe you're a singer-songwriter. That's it. - You look like a singer-songwriter. - I'm a bartender, actually. Ryan is such a softy. Why is that? Just to take on a charity case like you. Let's face it... You're not exactly the type of woman he normally dates. He's so sweet. Don't you think so? What's going on? Why weren't you at school today? 'Cause I'm a terrible person. I ruined the best thing that ever happened to me. Navid hates me. I sang for him, and he still rejected me. You sang for him? I brought him my guitar, and I serenaded him. That's special. I begged for his forgiveness, and he said no. I'd do anything to make my heart stop hurting. Maybe for now... You should go to a meeting. I just want the pain to stop. I got a hand nail this morning and I took out my scissors, and that's what I remembered. I met Sasha at the nail salon. Who? A hand nail what? That's a little coincidental. I thought she looked familiar. Oh my God. I showed her a picture of Dixon. I bet they were already going out and she acted as if she didn't know me. This girl is weird. What kind of an adult would date a high school student? Call it women's intuition, but I know that there is something off about her. It's how she acts toward Dixon, the way she touched his arm - when they already broken up. - Touched his arm? And the sonogram. I didn't even tell you about it. She's not pregnant. She's lying. Stop. I wish it weren't true, too. - It doesn't make any sense. - I know. - We need to talk to you. - Sure. Adrianna's not doing so well. Adrianna's not my problem. Just hear us out. We went over to her place last night, and she was sobbing and out of it and... We're worried she's going to start using again. We tried to get her to go to a meeting, but she wouldn't go. Will you ask her? It's not my place anymore. You might not be her boyfriend, but you still care about her. Please. Can I have a word with you? What the hell did you say to Ramona? Ramona? I'm sorry, I'm drawing a blank. The girl at your apartment? The one with the greasy-looking kind of brown hair? Did you tell her that she was old looking, and I was dating her out of charity? What is wrong with you? I have nothing against Ramona. I barely met the girl, and she seems perfectly nice. She looks like she has a great personality. You're jealous. Please. I am not jealous. I am just not entirely comfortable with you dating all these random hipster-type girls with pierced god-knows-whats. - It's unbecoming. - And you don't like it. Fine, I don't like it. - Who knows what diseases... - Stop. Okay? Admit that it's not fun seeing me with other girls. Fine. It's not. Well, it's not fun watching you date one trustafarian after another. What are we going to do about it? I'm not going to not date other people unless you're going to not date other people. - Fine. - Fine. - Great. - Perfect. What is this? What's going on here? Are we fighting, or dating? It's both, I think. - What? - Are you going to kiss me? - Fine. - Fine. I'm so excited. Tonight I'm going to go back up to the Hollywood sign to shoot some intervolometer shots of the sunset. I'm gonna intercut those with Annie's daydream. God it's going to be good, it really is. - Next. - Could we get a regular chilI dog, A Guadalajara dog and a Swiss cheese with - Pastrami? - With Brooklyn pastrami. That's a lot of money to be carrying around. Are you afraid I'm gonna get mugged? Don't worry, I can take care of myself. - Where'd it come from? - Where? Thank you. Uh, keep the change. Wh-What do you want me to tell you? Who I bank with? Or do you want me to explain the capitalist system of symbolic currency? Or maybe how trees turn into paper? Are you a drug dealer? What? Why would you even ask me that? Navid... Navid Shirazi, he told me that you were a drug dealer. And you believed him? - I don't know what to believe. - God, I'm an idiot. I thought you were different than everyone else. I thought it was you and me against the world. You know what gets me? Never once, when everybody was calling you a slut, when they were talking about you, did I ever doubt you, did I ever question your integrity. Not once. And now you hear one stupid rumor and you lose all faith in me. I just lost faith in you, okay? - It's done. - What? It's done. I'm leaving, all right? Bye-bye. Dude, what the heck? You can't just come in here... - Ready to party? - Grab that jacket. We don't care if you don't like Hollywood parties. You're coming with us. - Are you wearing a dress? - It's not a big deal. My mom told me to get dressed up, so I did. Oh, my God, you've got perfume on, don't you? - I can smell you from here. - No, I don't have perfume on, dude. It's scented body lotion. - Whatever. Can we go? - Let's go. - How are you? - I'm good. It's been ages! - I know. What's up? - Here you are. I want you to meet Ryan. What's going on? Nice to meet you. - My boyfriend. - Okay. Congrats. Listen, I want to introduce you to our guys, too. Chad, this is Ryan. - How you doing, man? - What's up, brother? This is Rhea. - How are you? - And that's Shay. - Hey, man. Want me to do the... - No, no. It's good like that. So, we got to go set up, but it was really nice to meet you. - You, too, man. Big fan. - I'm gonna see you around. Have a good show. - I just met Pharrell. - You did. I want you to meet somebody. You introduce me to cool musicians, and I will introduce you to high school students. How's that sound? - Great. - Come here a minute. This kid's pretty special. I want you to meet Liam, one of my favorite students, and Liam, this is Jen, my girlfriend. We've met before. Where was that? I think it was at a party, right? I got to go. - Sorry. I don't know what that was. - Don't worry about me. Is he okay? He seems... troubled. I guess he is a little troubled. He's had some anger issues in the past. I just thought I was... I don't know, getting through to him or something. You are an amazing teacher. And if anyone can reach a kid like that, it's you. You okay? Not really. All I can think about is how I screwed up. I'm so, so, so sorry. NaomI and Silver, they think you might start using again. I really think that you should go to a meeting. Will you go with me? - It's not my place. - Oh, my God. I'm not your person anymore. - I can't take this. - I can't be. You have people. You have friends. It's up to you, Ade. Dude, I cannot believe it. So you snuck into Madison Square Garden? - That is awesome. - Tickets are expensive. So, anyway, we were going through this tunnel. And it's, like, itch black inside and when we come up, we're... We're, like, two feet from the stage. Whatever. It was cool. You guys want something to drink? Sure. Thanks. What's up with Liam and Malibu Barbie? To make a long story short, they used to go out, ended badly. She's over him. He says he's over her, but who knows? Maybe you could help him get over her. What do you mean? Why? Why me? I don't know. Cause you have a huge crush on him. - You dragged him here to the party. - Whatever. Come on. You're wearing heels and, like, three gallons of perfume. First of all, it's scented body lotion. And, no, I do not have a crush on him. So, that was kind of awkward. We're bound to run into each other now, and I want things to be okay between us. You're scared of me. Of you? You're afraid I might tell Matthews what happened that night. You're crazy. If you weren't scared, you wouldn't be talking to me. More coffee? What a coincidence! By the way, I realized I met you at the nail salon. Remember? Oh, my God. Right. Right. Imagine running into each other like that when you were secretly dating my son. Now, that was a coincidence. Especially since you didn't remember me afterwards. I did remember you, and it wasn't a coincidence. I followed you to the nail salon because somehow, I knew that Dixon wasn't telling me the truth, which he wasn't. And so, there, with you, that is when I found out that Dixon was in high school. And, Mrs. Wilson, I was devastated. Call me Debbie. Okay. You know, you... really shouldn't be drinking coffee when you're pregnant. Oh, no, I know. I'm going to stop. It's hard to quit. Believe me, I remember. All of these things are suddenly off-limits. You should really get a list from your doctor. By the way, which Dr. Alderman are you seeing? - Is it Karen Alderman or Ross Alderman? - It's Karen. Now, that is a coincidence. Karen Alderman is a friend of mine. No kidding? I'm gonna tell her to take very good care of you. You don't have to... - Really, I want to. - No, I'd rather you didn't. Okay. So, tell me about the sonogram. It's just amazing when you hear that heartbeat for the first time, isn't it? It was totally amazing. It's particularly amazing since you can't hear the heartbeat until week six. - What? - I'll give you a hint. It starts with,"You're not pregnant," and it ends with, "Stay away from my son." Enjoy your coffee, Sasha. What are you doing here? I believe you. And I believe in you. I'm so sorry, Jasper. I shouldn't have listened to them. I mean, of course you're not a drug dealer. I should have known better than that, and... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's me... it's me and you against the world. Right? Come here. Okay, but just... Don't ever doubt me again. I won't. I won't. Ade just texted me. She's coming to the party. Good. Maybe she's starting to snap out of it. I'm going to go check out the music. Find me later. - You just get here? - I'm gonna get something to eat. Navid, listen, I'm really sorry about what happened between me and Adrianna. And I was a jerk. I really don't know what else to say, other than I thought you were just like some guy I didn't know. And now, well, you're not. I'm really sorry. You told me. You were straight with me about what happened. I appreciate that, at least. I'm gonna get something to eat, all right? - Navid, what's up? - How's it going, man? All right. The party's not bad. For a Hollywood thing. Good to see you. The girls are pretty cute. You should go talk to 'em. Not right now. You should go for it. They're pretty cute. - No, I don't... I don't know. - Come on, man. You can do it. Go! Go on. Just do it. - Go! - Okay, enough! Enough already! Man!? - Are you serious? - Go! Glad you made it out. Good for you. So, you having fun? Not really. That's okay. At least you're trying. Dealing with a cancer patient can be really intense. Can we talk about something not cancer related? Sure. I'm using new hair product in my locks. What do you think? It leaves my hair manageable yet, you know, touchably soft. - Really? - Go on, touch it. Excuse me. Whoop. Sorry. There you are. I got you some chicken satay. I had to do some vicious things to procure it. I'm... I'm not proud. Actually, I'm a little proud. I feel kinda manly. What's wrong? Look, I'm sure Liam is a good kid. I'm sure you're right, Ryan. He's just... self-destructive. What do you mean, self-destructive? What happened? When I met him before at this party, he propositioned me. But I didn't think I needed to tell you about it until now... - because now it happened again. - What? I was walking to the bathroom and, well, basically, Liam suggested that he follow me in. Are you kidding me? He's just a troubled kid... It's unbelievable. You try to reach out to somebody, - you try to be their teacher, and... - Hey, stop. He doesn't deserve you. But there are plenty of other amazing kids who do. Dixon, you in there? What's going on? Dixon, are you okay? Sasha called. She had a miscarriage. She lost the baby, and she doesn't want to see me anymore. I don't know what to think or what to feel. I feel relieved... I feel guilty and sad. I really just don't know what to feel. - We have something that... - You're gonna be okay. That we need to tell you These things happen. And it's hard, but if you learn from this mistake, you're gonna be okay. Sorry. Look, I'm sorry I stormed off like that before. That's what you're sorry about? You don't want to apologize for the fact that you just hit on my girlfriend? - What? - What the hell's wrong with you? What was that, Deb? You lied to him. I know. I just couldn't bear the look on his face if he found out she was lying. It would hurt him too much. It would break his heart. I don't know. You have to trust me. Sometimes, you have to trust me. Forgot your swag. Bath salts, a key chain. - They put anything good in here? - A chocolate bar. I scarfed yours down on the drive over. Nice. I saw you leave the party. You kinda just like looked upset or something. - You all right? - I'm okay. What happened? Nothing. Matthews just pissed me off. You want to talk about it? You want me to go? So, what's under the tarp? Nothing. It's private. Tell me it's not Mr. Matthews. So, glad you lost that getup. What was with that, anyway? Like, every once in a while, it's kinda nice to remind people I'm not - actually a dude. - Nobody thinks you're a dude. - Sometimes you do. - Me? No, I don't. I don't want anything serious. "Serious"? What are you, a girl? - I'm sorry that the sun went down. - You're sorry? It's not your fault. But your sunset footage... I'm gonna get some film from the car... works at night. Be right back. - Okay, don't be long.
