Certainly didn't grow up in a place like this. You're the first brother at West Beverly to play varsity lacrosse as long as anyone can remember. Who is that? just a cheerleader. Everything you have done was just to set me up to ruin my birthday? Absolutely. Being your friend, I'm over it. I already beat you to it. You want to be with me? Well, yeah. I'm a virgin. What? I was trying to push you away. Why? Because I slept with Ryan. 25 years, that's a long time.I don't know that I can possibly make that up to you. It's all good.Everything's cool here. I'm making myself right at home. Ah, you should have seen me. I was poppin' huge air off all the moguls and just shredding down the black diamonds. Look at you,Mr. Hotshot Boarder. You gotta come next year. I really missed you. No, you missed the chance to laugh at me when I face-planted off the ski lift. I'm a simple man with simple pleasures. Kansas, darling,how was your winter break? Oh, my God, Mom and I took Sean to Cancun, but you probably already heard that from him. Yep, he mentioned it. Oh, my God,he's so awesome. It was so great to spend that quality time with my half brother.I mean, our half brother. I'm so sorry.I didn't mean to exclude you. No problem.You didn't. We had a blast. Oh, my God, I totally dared Sean to eat a fried grasshopper. And we laughed so hard, I thought grasshopper was going to come out his nose. I'm so sorry you missed it. It's not a competition,Naomi. You can Sean it up as much as you want. That is really mature of you,Annie. Honestly, I don't think I could be quite so open-minded if Sean didn't want to hang out with me. Well, it was an adjustment,what with him wanting to stay at your house and all. Oh, wait. He's staying with us.My bad. Point, Miss Wilson. Okay, well, can you let me know if you hear from him? Hey. You okay? Yeah, um... it's just I have this friend Hank from rehab? He hasn't returned any of my texts. Nobody from group has even heard from him. Could he be on vacation? Maybe. But when an addict just disappears like that... Everybody, settle in, please. Take your seats.Thank you very much. Today we're gonna talk about perception. I mean, how do we even perceive? Well, the eyes take in information and then it passes that information off to the brain. Seems pretty straightforward,but you can still see without using your eyes, and that's called... ..."intuition." Using your intuition. I'm so sorry. I wish I had better news. And there's nothing that I can do? Some surgery or drug therapy? Not in this case. Is there somebody I can call for you? A husband? A boyfriend? No, there's no guy in the picture at the moment. You said you used to live here before. Are there some friends you could talk to about this? I've burned all of those bridges. Hey, D. Hey, girl. What's up? Got this week's new pick. It's a rough mix of a new band my dad just signed, Drops In The Fall.Excellent. Oh, yeah, and thank you for the Sam Cooke stuff. I knew about his R&B stuff, but I didn't know he did gospel. Really? That's how he got started. It blew me away. Hey, babe.Hey, Silver. How was your winter break? Oh, you know,the usual: eggnog, sugar crash,remorse, New Year's. Well, tell me what you think. Yes. Bye, D. Peace. Bye, D. Why you gotta act like that? Have we met? And besides, I think she's into you. Which doesn't make me want to hug her. Except for maybe around the neck. You're crazy. Yeah, well,it works for me. But anyway, Bio awaits.Later, D. Hi, Annie. Hey. Hey, I just came to see my dad. Yeah, we're goin' surfing. I know. He wanted to take the van. So, how's school? You know, reading, writing,all that fun stuff. Arithmetic. Yup. That's pretty much how I remember it. Surf's up! You're going surfing. Yeah, Sean invited me. Oh, you don't surf, do you? Harry's an amazing teacher. You should come, Annie. You should come. I mean, you don'thave to be naturally graceful to surf. You know, I'm gonna pass. But, uh, tell my dad I had to run. I'll see you guys later. Boo. Hey, Miss Taylor, um,do you have a minute? Sure, yeah. Come on in. Sit down. How are you? I'm... I'm okay, I guess. I was wondering if you had a way to get in touch with Miss Walsh. Uh, Brenda? Yeah. Um, my rehab group is hosting this support day tomorrow to thank all the people who have helped with our recovery. Most people would bring their families, but I was gonna bring Navid, but he's at his cousin Avi's wedding. I see. Your mom can't make it. Well, she could. I just kinda don't want her She pretty much checked out on that whole stand-by-your-kid thing. Does that make me a jerk? No, it makes you somebody who's looking out for herself. But I'm sorry your mom's not there for you. It's okay.Miss Walsh was, and, uh, I'd really like her to come. Uh, you know what? Brenda is usually pretty busy with her work. Sure. Okay. But you know what? I will talk to her. Thank you so much, Miss Taylor. It really means a lot to me. Chastity belt!Giraffe! A promise ring. Uh, Cheerios. A tusk!An elephant! What? How did you get that? That looks like a sock. That was the trunk. Let's go. Next, next! Time's running. It's a weapon.Somebody's hunting! Hunting.Archery. Yes! What?! That drawing looked like a sock, too. An argyle sock. Go, go, go! Yeah, I know, a sock. That is a small...Oh! Time is up.Thank God! Good! How'd we do? Nine points, b-b-baby! * Wilson men kicking ass and taking names. * Why don't you let a real artiste show you how it's done? Ready, girls? Ready. Come on, Grandma. Come on. Hmm...It's a sock. Tabitha, could you pick up the pace? Um, she's crosshatching. Tabitha! Here, let me try again. Tabula rasa. Shoot me now. Oh, excuse me. Hello. A skull? Death? Murder? No, though, come to think of it, It does resemble a bit of a Vanitas still life. Come on,Ladies, time is running out. Says who? Oh, boo! - Come on!  - All right, all right. Don't get your panties in a bunch. Mm, thank you, Mom. Excellent job. You gotta back off. I told you I'll get the money and I will. All right, I just need a little more time. And-And I promise... Hello? Damn! Sean, what's going on? It's nothing, really. What I heard wasn't nothing. It was definitely something. Sean, we're family here. You can talk to us. Okay. My father, adopted father,he He was a gambler. He made some money at it. But then he got in way over his head. He couldn't come up with what he owed. So, he killed himself. Oh, my God. He did it to protect me. You know, he thought his life insurance could clear his debt, but sure enough It turns out his policy doesn't cover suicide. So now these guys, the guys that were after him for the money... Now they're after you. Let us help. How much did you father owe? $200,000. Look, I didn't want to worry you with this. I'm shipping out in a week. What are they gonna do, come to Iraq and find me? They don't have the guts. So, who's turn is it to draw, huh? Annie, Got a minute? - Yeah.- I wanted to apologize. I hope that phone call didn't upset you. No, no, and-and I don't want you to think I was eaves dropping on purpose. - I was just there. - Of course. No, I know. I'd hate to think that I, uh, you know,caused you any worry. Oh, it's okay. I-I just thought my dad would want to know, So I felt like I had to say something. Yeah, yeah. It's nice to have people around who care. Here. Thanks. You could take that if you want. No, no, it's late. It'll go to voicemail. No worries. So, good night. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Good night. Mother, I doubt that will help. Believe me, dear,when the topic of discussion is money, drinking always helps. What is the economic situation here? - What are the options?  - I do so wish I could help. But I've taken such a beating in the market recently, I simply can't. In fact, I think it's time for me to go back to work. Really? Well, money's only part of it. The truth is I miss acting. Digging into the script, arguing with the director, canoodling with my co-stars. It's a calling. And then there were two. You know, our retirement account is in pretty good shape. Because we've left it alone. I know, just hear me out. We're not paying rent here, right? The house in Wichita will sell eventually. Maybe we borrow against our 401(k). O-Or the kids' college funds. Harry... We can't do nothing. I-I know you're worried. I think, um...Tracy should Be included in this discussion. You would be okay with that? Well, she's Sean's mother. If I were in her place, I would want to know. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to give her a call. Thank you. Dad's pretty freaked out. Can you blame him? Dix, do you... Um... What do you think about Sean? What do you mean, what do I think about him? Don't you like him? Well, I've never really felt completely comfortable around him, you know? I-I was walking by his room before and... You know, it's probably nothing. What? He got a local call. No! All right, but he got a local call. So? So, who'd be calling him? He said he didn't know anybody in town. I don't know. It could've been Tracy. Naomi or... a wrong number, you know? Yeah, yeah, I guess. Look, when Sean first came here, you know, I freaked out. And it hurt Dad, a lot. Don't put everybody through the same thing again. All right? Yeah. Good night. Night. Kelly. Here on my doorstep. I wouldn't be if you'd returned my calls today. Sorry, I just couldn't deal with any of the Ryan drama today. Probably should have thought of that before you slept with him. That's not why I'm here. Can I come in? Adrianna asked me to get in touch with you. Her rehab group is having support day. She wants you there. Why me? Because you stood up for her, more than her own mom. She sees you as a mother figure. I didn't ask for that. But whether you asked for it or not, that's the way it is. I can't make it. Why, because it's me asking? It's got nothing to do with you. Then what is it? This girl is in the early stages of recovery. She needs you. If you were reaching out for help, wouldn't you want people standing by you? I think you should leave. You know, Brenda, I knew you were selfish. But this? This is unforgiveable. If you're gonna ditch school, go to the beach, not to work. Nat needed help with the breakfast shift, so, I came through. Uh, you need a table? Nope, just coffee and a bagel. Did you give that CD a listen? Actually, yeah, you know,it reminded me of Prince. It kind of did. Maybe with a little middle-period Curtis. Curtis...? You're kidding. Curtis Mayfield? Only, like, the greatest songwriter of the '60s. What are you doing tomorrow? Nothing, why? My dad has this thing at our beach house once a month-- it's a gospel choir barbeque, a lot of people from his label, but the food is really good and the music is dope.You should come. I mean, unless Silver would have an issue with that. Oh, um, no, nah, not at all. Not at all, you just count me in. Here you go. I'll text you the details later. Keep the change. Thank you. We did mother and son Watsu. I thought we were close. It's not you. He didn't want anybody to know. This whole thing just makes me sick to my stomach. If I hadn't given him up... if he hadn't been adopted by this terrible man! Tracy, we cannot beat ourselves up about it. What is past is past. But he needs our help. Yeah. And the fact of the matter is that I have means that you two don't. Thank you, Tracy. That's very generous. I mean, it's not going to be as easy with the divorce as it would've been otherwise. I mean, there was the pre-nup, so... Anything you could do would be great. I think I'm going to call my business manager. Maybe I will sell some of Charles' art. There is a Damien Hirst that I couldn't wait to get out of my bathroom. I'll be in touch. We'll get through this. Thank you for not stabbing her to death with a pencil. If you had scissors on your desk, it'd be a different story. But honestly, in this case I think she's kind of entitled. Let's see what she comes up with. Hey, want to go get some lunch? Yes, but first, I'm just finishing up a post on that creepy custodian guy. You know, the one with the lazy eye? I'm fairly certain he was checking out my ass this morning. Then again, maybe he was just tired. Ooh, want to see something good? Check out my cheerleader post. Hmm, "Shake, Shimmy and Shut Up." Nice headline. Thank you. But the only one you mention here by name is Christina. My blog is called The Vicious Circle. And you know my motto: Show no mercy. So, what's your deal for tomorrow afternoon? There's a Tarantino festival at the Arclight. I...I know, I know it's pretentious and violent and derivative but totally awesome. If you just give Death Proof one chance, I swear you're going to love it. I-I, um... I got a... I got to do a family thing. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, Annie told me how crazy things are with Sean. It's cool. Yeah. Um, food. Starved. Let's go. Brenda really wanted to be here. Of course, um, I understand. But I'm proud of you. What you've accomplished, you're amazing. Thank you. Yes, she is. Hi. Oh, you made it. Awesome. Yeah. I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic's a bitch. I'm so happy you could come. There's so many people I want to introduce you to. I'm really hoping that my Hello, everyone! If everybody could come inside, we're gonna get started. Let's go. I wake up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat, hating myself. But when I realize it's just a nightmare, I'm so relieved. Relieved that I'm okay, relieved that I'm clean, and grateful. Grateful for all the people who have been there for me. People who believed in me, even when I didn't believe in myself. So, I think I'm gonna be okay. Would anybody from Adrianna's support team like to share? I haven't really known Adrianna that long, but ever since I met her, I've admired her She's passionate. She's smart. And most importantly, she actually learns from her mistakes, which is more than I can say for myself. She's my friend. And that's not a word that I use lightly. And I'll always have her back. Hands off the fries. How'd you do that? Eyes in the back of my head. I should use you for this psych paper. Intuition and extrasensory French fry perception. Your mother let you out of the house in that outfit? Oh, my God, Annie. You have to see these pictures. -No, thanks. -Show me. Well, they're just pictures of Sean and I. I'm going to put them on Facebook later. Ooh, he's hot. Oh, my God. This is us at the beach right before going surfing. Oh, and this is us goofing off in the car. You can still see without using your eyes. Sean, what's going on? You could take that if you want. It'll go to voicemail. No worries. He got a local call. So? And that's called using your intuition. There's something I gotta do What? Nothing, but I gotta go. Oh, my God. Can I just tell you, he is so adorable. Tell me I'm crazy. You're crazy. Yeah. Yeah, maybe I'm crazy. I mean, I'm probably crazy. At least I hope that I'm crazy, because everybody loves him-- Naomi obviously. Maybe she's right. Maybe I'm just jealous. Annie, whoa, take a breath. What are you talking about? Mom, there's something off about Sean. And I don't have any proof, and I know that and I really don't want to hurt Dad, but I have this hunch that something is not right. I know. I have the same feeling. You do? I thought it was just me that maybe I couldn't handle the fact that your dad and Tracy have a child together, But that's not it. Something doesn't add up. It would break Dad's heart if he knew how we felt. I know, but it would be worse if we were right and we didn't act on it. So, what do we do? Nice speech. Yeah. Uh, listen, you and me, we have such crazy history. Don't worry, I know you came for Adrianna, not me. No, what I mean is... that history connects us. You know me better than anyone else. I need that. Really? Yeah. I'm going through some crazy stuff right now. Hey, guys, I wanted to introduce you to my sponsor, Amy. Hey, I'm Brenda. Kelly. Nice to meet you. Glad you guys could both make it. I actually want to introduce them to Hank. Have you seen him anywhere? Oh, Ade, I thought you'd heard. Heard what? He found out he's HIV positive. He started using again. I'm really sorry. Excuse me. I can't believe he relapsed. Who is Hank? Is that your boyfriend? No, he's... he's not my boyfriend. We slept together a couple of times. Have you been tested? No. I'm fine. You need to get tested. We'll both go with you, right? Right. * Well, they've warned you and they told you * * Just leave it to the Lord * * Have courage, don't worry * * Just leave it to the Lord * * He never sleeps£¬sees everything... * I'm glad you made it. Me, too. This is amazing. Um, was that Kobe inside? Yeah, if he's in town, he never misses Daddy's barbecues. I got to be honest, I really didn't know that there was this many black people in Beverly Hills. Well, you just have to know where to look. I guess you're right. Let me guess...you're Dixon. Yes, sir. I'm Franklin Whitney, Stina's father. I've heard a lot about you, young man. Oh. Well, uh, nice to meet you, sir. Stina tells me you're into music. Yes. She's, uh, put me on to a lot of great stuff. You play an instrument? -No, but I-I love to sing.  -You any good? I... uh, you know, I haven't had any complaints, but then again, I mostly sing in the shower. Well, don't wait to be discovered. If singing's what you love, you make it happen. Yeah. Stina, baby, Dre's leaving, and he wanted to say good-bye. Dr. Dre? PhD. Listen, don't be a stranger, Dixon. Hope we'll see a lot more of you, all right? Yes, sir. I'll be right back. All right. -Okay... -Deb. Can we talk? Yeah, I think we should. Give me a minute. Look, I've been doing some research, and I think I found a way we can take a second mortgage out on the house. Harry, I went to see the private investigator that found Sean. Okay. I'm sorry I went behind your back, but we're in a pretty unusual situation here, and I wanted to get some answers. Did the P.I. have any answers? No... but, honey, doesn't it strike you as odd that Sean shows up out of nowhere and asks us for money? No, Tracy found him, and he didn't ask us for money. We offered. Annie doesn't trust him. Look, that's... that's not about Sean. That is about Naomi. It's about Annie being a teenager, and it is about jealousy. We went through this with Dixon. -Harry... -Look, sweetheart, I know that this has been a big adjustment for everybody, but Sean is my son and I owe him. Look, I know how you feel-- I do-- but I won't let you pay down your guilt at the expense of Annie and Dixon. Sean's as much my child as Annie or Dixon. He's not my child. Okay. So, what does that mean? You saying that you don't care about Sean? I don't feel the same way about him that you do, and I think that you're letting your guilt -cloud your judgment. -My guilt? Yes, something's not right here, Harry. Sean. What happened? You okay? The guys my dad owed... they found me. I'm calling the cops. No, no, please. Look, these aren't the kind of guys who let people call the cops and get away with it. This isn't y'all's problem. I'm so sorry. I'll be gone in the morning. -No, Sean... -It's the only way. We will get the money somehow. Don't worry. Al Elmore Investigations. Hello? Why do they always have the ugliest art in waiting rooms? Right, and they're all the same. They must have a catalog. I am such an idiot. There was so much I wanted to do with my life now that I'm clean. Hey, listen to me. We don't know anything yet. Adrianna Tate Duncan? Yes. Your HIV test is negative. Oh, my God! Oh, my God, that is the best news ever. Thank you so much. Oh, my God. But there's something else. What? When we ran your blood work, It turns out you're pregnant No. You should see your gynecologist to discuss your options. I can't be pregnant. I'm only 16. Okay, look, I know you're freaking out right now, but let's just take this one step at a time, right, Brenda? I have to go. I'm sorry. Brenda. I can't tell my mom. My mom's gonna kill me. I will help you talk to her, sweetie. I don't even know where Hank is. We will find him. He might not even be the father. I slept with a lot of guys when I was using. What's Navid gonna think? He's gonna hate me. No. He's gonna totally hate me. This can't be happening. This... no, this isn't happening. Shh. Come here, come here. It's gonna be okay. I can't take it. All right, Tracy, let's meet here in the morning and figure out how much we can pull together. -Yeah. -Dad... -look, please listen to me. -Annie, I don't have time for this right now. Mom, look. The last five calls that Sean received was from Al Elmore, the P.I. Why would they be in touch? Wait. What are you doing,going through his things? First, you go to a P.I., then you invade a man's privacy. Annie, what's going on with you? I'm scared, Dad. I know how much Sean means to you, and I'm really scared that you're never gonna forgive me for this, but I'm more scared that something is not right. And you agree with her. We don't think Sean is who he says he is. Give us the same benefit of the doubt that you're giving him. What do you want me to do? Ask him to take a paternity test. Please? Sean is my son. I know it. I can feel it in my guts, in my bones, but if that's what you need me to do... I'll do it. You shock me. * Ooh-ooh-ooh * * And we'll rejoice * * And we'll rejoice singing * * Every day * Here you go. Thank you. So, Daddy really liked you. You should come to dinner next week. look, Christina, you're amazing, and I'm very grateful that you invited me here and introduced me to... this whole world... but... but... the thing is, I have a girlfriend. I know. So do I. Wait, what? Tiffany. That cute soprano. Did you think -I was making a move on you? -No. No. I'm just surprised that... I've had boyfriends, too, but I'm not interested in you in that way. I just invited you here 'cause I thought you'd like this. No, no, no, I... I do, I... this is... this is amazing. Well, you're welcome anytime. Silver, too. If it wouldn't ruin her street cred to hang out with a cheerleader. No, not at all. * Oh, oh, happy, happy day * * Oh, happy day * * Happy day * * Yeah, yeah Oh, happy day * * Oh, happy day. * What the hell is wrong with you? How could you leave Adrianna at the clinic like that? I mean, that's pretty low, Brenda, even for you. Kel, I... I can't have kids. What? I had fibroids removed a while ago, and there were complications, and kids are not an option for me. I'm sorry. You know, when I first heard, I thought, it's not... the end of the world... but, then, somehow, when I heard that Adrianna, who wasn't even trying and doesn't even want it, is pregnant... I'm pathetic. I'm jealous of a 16-year-old girl. You're not pathetic. - you wanted kids.  - I didn't. I mean, I, I figured that I would in the future, but... man, I hate it when people tell me I can't do something. I can't do something. That's the Brenda I know and love. You know, I didn't think I could have kids either, but medicine is changing all the time. I'm kind of ready now, so...I'm thinking of adopting. Bren... wow.I think that's a great idea. And I would really like you in my life for that. I'm not going anywhere. Hey... you made it. Cool party, huh? You want me to introduce you to Denzel? Why would you lie to me about this? Are you into Christina? No... Look, I apologize. I shouldn't have lied to you, and I'm not into Christina and she's not into me. Trust me. But I didn't know how to talk to you about all of this. All what? This. I'm a black kid in a white family, so there's this whole other culture I have never experienced. Then Christina came along and she's exposed me to some really amazing things, but... I know you hate her. Okay... well, "hate" is a very strong word. "Loathe" and "detest,"yeah, maybe. Look... you're the girl I want to be with. All right? If you want me to end my friendship with Christina... No. No. I guess the fact that she can do something for you that I can't, well, it makes me kind of jealous. And that's so not me and totally lame. No, no,actually,I find it flattering. - Okay.You just have to do one thing for me. - All right, all right, I promise I won't lie to you again. No.Introduce me to Denzel. All right, yeah,he's right over there. Sean.How's the eye? Ah, it's okay. I come from hardy stock. We're going to get that money together. Thank you, Harry, that's...that's beyond generous. I'll pay you back,I swear to you. Just one catch. I need you to take a paternity test first. I'm sorry. Believe me, I know what the results are going to be. Harry, please,that's a lot of money. I'd ask the same thing if I was in your shoes. Of course I'll do it. I knew you would. You know what? I am not going to let anything happen to you. Everybody can I have your attention for a minute? I'm so glad you're all here. I'm reminded on these days of the many things I have to be thankful for-- my family, good friends, beautiful,beautiful music. So please... join me and reflect on all the things you have to be thankful for in your own lives. Hear, hear. You know "Amazing Grace"? Yeah. Why? Consider yourself discovered. * Amazing grace * * How sweet the sound * * That saved * * A wretch like me... * * I once was lost * * But now I'm found * * Oh, was blind * * But now I see. * So... I'm taking a paternity test in the morning. I was surprised Harry needed that kind of proof, but I guess not everyone trusts me. I thought you, Annie, out of all people, would understand. would understand. Understand what? You moved from Kansas to this perfect life in Beverly Hills. You just had it handed to you. Not everybody gets that chance. Not everyone gets to take what isn't theirs, either. what isn't theirs, either. Good night, Annie. Sean. Sean, you... Sean. * But then you're lost beyond all doubt... * * I don't know how to fix this * * I never mean to hurt you * * I know the dark side is no fun * * Another mark is made ... * * They're just done * * And you're the only thing I'm trying not to break... * * And now we're hearing pieces * * I think * * I should take * * The blame... * He cleared his stuff out He's gone What do you mean he's gone? He can't be gone. He's gone. He wasn't our son. No, I would know my own son. I would know if he was my son! Tracy... he wasn't our son. I'm so sorry, Tracy. Is this some kind of sick joke? No joke. He scammed all of us. He just wanted money. Okay, but if he is not our son, then who was he? I don't know. I called the P.I. this morning. His phone had been disconnected. They were probably working together. Oh, my God. Mom. Mom. No, I'm not,I'm not doing this. I'm not. Look, you were right about Sean. I have no idea how I'll make this up to you. It's okay. Hey, Dixon, you want to help me make breakfast? - Yeah, sure, whatever.  - Come on. Girls, if you need us,we'll be in the kitchen. Let's make some pancakes. Pancakes, my favorite. you okay? Are you insane? I know. I know, it's such a shock. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it but, you know, maybe, maybe we can take something good from this. With everything that's going on right now, I mean, maybe me and you can just finally call a truce. How do you keep managing to cause my family so much pain? Me? My mom had a son. I had a brother. He was not our brother. I mean, at least he leftbefore both our families leftbefore both our families were taken in by his scam. Your family. Sean came to our house last night and Mom gave him the money. Wait, what? I thought she didn't have it. She didn't have it, Annie. She called Dad and gave up some of her demands in the divorce so he would give her the money, and she gave it to Sean. I... I am so sorry. I did not know. Get away from me. This is your fault. * And the walls are caving in * * Behind me * * Air is getting thin... * Hey, Dad. I am so sorry. No, no, I'm sorry. I guess I should have trusted you. Oh, Daddy. I never wanted you to feel like this. Oh... I know,sweetheart. * And I miss you more than I should * * But I thought I could * * Can't get my mind off of you. *
