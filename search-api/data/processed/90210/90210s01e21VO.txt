As long as you want. liam,I'm not going to be your booty call. Girl:Hello,silver. Hey. I saw your movie on youtube. I can't go back to school. I'm enrolling at st. Claire'S. I just need a fresh start. You don't have to give your baby up if you don't want to. What are you saying?We should get married? Yes. Yes! Uh,married. Sure. Yeah,okay. We're getting married. Freshly pureed carrots coming on up. Who's hungry? I think I know who's hungry. Organic vegetables coming in for a landing. open up,hannah. Hannah? That's an odd name for a boy. Well,she's not going to be a boy. Oh,please.The way you're carrying?She's a boy. He's a boy. I will call him habib. Habib? Really? Do you want him to be teased mercilessly? Come on.Kids in beverly hills are used to all kinds of names. Not by kids. By me. Habib's a good name. Very masculine,yet sensitive. Navid: Which is the kind of kid he's going to be. Rugged but soulful; athletic,but not jocky. Intelligent,but not nerdy. Oh,and you know what I bet he's really going to be into? Chess. Adrianna: Babies do not play chess. Navid: Oh,if any baby could,ours could. I'm telling you,our little guy is going to have the best of everything. I made this bassinet,you know. I know and I love it. But babies do not play chess. Navid: Well,not at first,I guess. When he's older. I'm telling you,he's going to be a prodigy. Well,I don't need a prodigy. I just want a healthy baby. come to mama. We better get to school. Who's going to take care of hannah? My parents. Hello! Yeah,if they're on board. Of course I'm on board to raise our grandbaby. Navid? What? They don't even know I'm pregnant. Yeah,because you keep avoiding them,which you can't keep doing. Because unless you have the gestation period of an elephant, the cat is going to come out of the bag soon enough. Not to mix my animal metaphors. I know that they need to know. I just... I thought maybe you'd want to tell them by yourself, while I go hide under a bed. No,it's not going to be that bad,I promise. in fact,I can tell you exactly how the whole thing is going to go down. At first,yeah,they'll explode with anger. My mom's going to start to cry. oh,she cries when she burns dinner. While ' momcrs ying,my dad will rant about how we never should have moved to america. He'll say random things about,you know,the dangers of video games or processed sugar. He really hates processed sugar. -And then... -the's more? Well,then they'll start to calm down. My dad will begin to shake his head. My mom will start to sigh repeatedly. But the worst will be over. And that's when I'll bring in the clincher. I'll suggest,if they don't want to help take care of the baby, maybe we'll get a nanny and my mom will be like,"shirazis don't use nannies! "Are you crazy? Family takes care of family. " And then it will be all hugs and kisses and halva from there on out. I'm sorry. Don't you think they're going to totally freak when they find out you're not... -the biological father? -No. My mom was raised by her stepdad. It's her favorite person in the whole world. It's not going to matter to them who the sperm donor is. I'm going to be habib's father. I'm going to be the one to build his bassinet. well,habib is a very lucky kid,despite his unfortunate name. What about this? Are you and liam grabbing a drink or applying for a second mortgage? You're right.It's ridiculous. it's just,tomorrow's our first official date, and I want him to take me seriously,you know? I really like this guy. I mean... he's smart,interesting,deep. I want him to know that I have substance,too. I don't want him to think I'm just someone he has sex with in the woods,or in cars,or in your bed. -What? -Laundry. Oh,it's a figure of speech. Maybe I can find something to wear in here. So,listen,naomi,I know you're going through a difficult time... 'cause my dad's a pervert and the newspapers are comparing him to clarence thomas? Whoever that is. It's been tough. Yeah,I bet it has. But are you even talking to your father, trying to come up with a solution to this whole living situation? His solution is that I move back in with him and play the role of, "the good daughter," and make nice with his skanky girlfriend. My solution is that he take his solution and shove it uhis ass. The only compromise we came to is that I stay here until the sexual harassment case blows over and seriously, thank god you guys are letting me crash here. I am so grateful.You have no idea. Yeah! Thank you so much,mom. You're welcome. Wait,could you iron this,por favor? you are the best. Really. Oh,my god,I'm so mad right now! Take it easy! I can't! He makes me crazy! Who-who? Liam! He cancelled our date again. -I swear,I'm going to rage out right now! -No raging out! But why did he do it? Why?! Did he meet someone else? Or is he sick? Why don't you just ask him for an explanation? Yes! Yes! Oh,my god! I love living with you. Okay. What do you think? I think you look like you're going to catholic school come on,dixon,doesn't seeing me in this uniform make you feel a little bit better? Not really. Don't tell me you have a yeshiva fetish. Okay,I will try to grow out the little curls and wear a fur hat in the summer. I just think it's a little extreme. Wearing fur hats in the summer?Yeah,I agree. No,I'm not talking about fur hats. I'm talking about catholic school. I mean,you're not even catholic. It's pretty much like any other school,with the occasional mass. It's the only place that would take me mid-semester. You have to understand. I can't go back to west beverly. I'll always be "crazy bipolar girl who made a sex tape. " Silver,that's not true. Everyone there kno what I did. I walk in that building,people are going to stare and whisper and... I just can't take that. I can'T. I need a fresh start. And I need you to be supportive. Kelly got on board. Why can't you? Because kelly's still going to see you every day. I mean,you won't come hang out with me at the peach pit anymore. And you're not going to be in school.That's all... you're still going to see me all the time,I promise. Can't you try to accept this? For me? Does the outfit come with the knee socks? I'd like you all to welcome a new student who will be joining our homeroom. Please introduce yourself. Hi,I'm-I'm erin. Erin silver. And what brings you to st.Claire's,erin? well... uh,the academics mostly. I-I hear they're really good here. And I like what you have to offer in terms of,you know,god. And morals.I'm really excited to be around people with good morals. And that's pretty much it. Well,we're pleased to have you. Tell me,are you familiar with the catechism? um,I'M... no,not really. Not a problem. Why don't you have a seat,erin? Would anyone like to help erin brush up on the... Okay,angela. But remember,not everyone is as pious as you are. So go easy on her,okay? I will,sister mary elizabeth. All right. Let's begin with our morning offering. Oh,jesus,through the immaculate heart of mary, I offer you my prayers,works,joys,and sufferings of this day. Adrianna: What the hell? You okay? Dahlias are out of season. No! I'm having dinner with navid's parents tonight and dahlias are his mom's favorite flower. But the only florist that has them right now is up in santa barbara. Do you think I should ditch school and drive up there? Um,I'm going to go with no. What are you nervous about? His parents are in love with you. Yeah,but... but what? Okay. I was going to wait until tomorrow to tell you this. But,well, navid and I are getting married. What the hell? Okay.Not exactly the reaction I was hoping for. I'm sorry. I'm just. why? Well,we're going to keep the baby. You're going to ke bab they? Yeah,I am. Navid's going to raise it with me,which is why we're getting married. I don't understand why you have to get married to keep the baby. Or why you want to keep the baby,for that matter. I'm keeping the baby because it's my baby. I want to raise it and I didn't think it was possible before, but now,because of navid,it is. I want to be with him for the rest of my life. And he wants to do this with me. He's so amazing. Yeah,he'd have to be pretty amazing to be okay with raising ty's baby. Oh,he still thinks the dad's some guy from rehab?Ade! You know,it didn't seem that important when I was set on adoption. If you can't be honest with navid,do you really think you should be marrying him? It's complicated. It's not. You're afraid if you tell him the truth,your perfect little marriage fantasy will end. Look,don't judge me. If you love him,you need to tell him. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Proudly Presents Sync: YTET-¼úÃ¨ -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- 90210.  Season 1 Episode21 what's that I smell? Are we,perchance,having salmon for dinner? We are. Three times this week. You guys take that omega-3 propaganda seriously,huh? No,mom makes salmon because she knows how much I like it. Maybe you should think about what the other family members might want. : Kobe beef. : Just kidding. Filet's fine. So,how was your first day without sier? Well,it... oh,poor dixie. He's bumming hardcore. Long distance relationships blow. Stop calling me dixie. And,uh,yeah,they do blow. You're not in a long-distance relationship,dixie... dixon. Silver's just going to another school. You'll have to put in a little extra effort. Yeah,I guess you're right. Got a feeling it's not gonna work. Hey,there,easy on the pepper,mama. So what do you kids have planned for the rest of the day? You're not gonna stand around watching me cook,are you? I'm going to the gyno. Aw,geez,naomi! What? It's time for my pap. Oh,hey,annie,you know about hpv,right? 'Cause it doesn't matter if you have your little v card, all it takes is some genital contact... -naomi! -Please? What? -Ask me how I know that. -It's okay,really. Super hot gyno.He talks,I listen. Anyways,I'm off. Have fun. Oh,believe me,I will. So,salmon,huh?Yum. Dixon,where are you going? Um,not really hungry anymore. Okay,the catechism is arranged into four principle parts. I'm assuming you know the lord's prayer? Not a problem.We'll go over it. Cool.Thanks. Of course.My pleasure. So,you went to west beverly,right? Well,I know what you meant by wanting to be around people with better morals. I don't know how you survived west beverly. It's like sodom and gomorrah over there with... with all the sex and drugs,so much money and excess,and no moral compass. Sometimes I'll see those west beverly kids at the movies, and they'll buy a medium soda and then just keep going back for refills. And it's not like they got the jumbo which comes with free refills,you know? And they could totally afford the jumbo. Yeah,um,that's why I left. Things like the soda stuff. Should we get back to the catechism,though? 'Cause I just have so much to learn. Of course. Now,I know this can be overwhelming. Try not to think of it as work,okay? Think of religion as like... the best extracurricular activity ever. Okay. Decided to do a little shopping after the gyno. What do you think? So cute! Good,it's for you. Try it on. What?Why? So I can see if it fits.Go.Shoo. Yeah,I know,but why did you buy me a gift? To thank you. That advice you gave me about confronting liam,ask him why he canceled? Genius. He told me the reason. We came up with a solution,and voila,we're back on for tonight. And so why did he cancel? Oh,his cousin came up from san diego.He had to hang with him. -Does it fit? -Perfectly. I just need help with the zipper. Wow,it oks amazing on you. Try these on with it. You got me shoes,too?What,naomi? Put them on. so are you gonna hang out with this cousin,too? Yeah,we're gonna do the double date thing. With who? Well,seeing as you're already dressed... naomi,I hate blind dates. Please?! You know how important tonight is to me. Okay,I'll go. uh,hey,so thanks again for everything today,and I'll see you tomorrow. All right,have a good night. You,too. Hey,what are you doing here? I called kels and I told her I was gonna pick you up.So, okay,well,um,let's,let's go,all right? Everything all right? You shouldn't have come. I'm trying to keep a low profile. I wasn't exactly making a scene. I know,I just,I don't need people here knowing things about me. I told you,I'm trying to make a fresh start. So that means you can't have a boyfriend? No... I just... I want to keep my personal life separate from school,okay? So what does that mean for us? I mean,you don't want to go anywhere we might run into anyone from west bev; you don't want me near st.Clare's; so where does that leave us to hang out? I don't know my house,your house. Are you serious? Look,this is just what I need right now,okay? Hello,navid. Thanks,jackie. It's gonna be okay. hi,guys. Hey,you two! Adrianna,we are so glad you're having dinner with us tonight. We keep telling navid to bring you by,but you know how he is,so private. well,thank you so much for having me. These are for you. Oh,I love peonies. That's so thoughtful.Thank you. : It's gonna be okay. So,how have you been? Well, this is an outrage.This is just outrageous. Look, I know, I know this is a shock, but we're in love, and,we're getting married. Married?! 16 and you're having a baby?! This is an outrage! -I knew it! -I try to be a good mother! I knew we should have never moved to america! -I knew it was a mistake! -What did I do wrong?! Mom,dad,we came to you because we have a plan and we want you to be a part of it. You have a plan? What kind of plan could you possibly have?! We thought we could live in the guest house. We still want to finish high school and go to college. Of course,we'll,we'll maybe have to hire some help. Maybe we'll get a nanny? Our family doesn't use nannies! are you nuts in the head?! your cousin ravi will watch the baby two days a week. I'll take care of the others. Family takes care of family. Thanks,mom. What did you expect? This baby's blood. Uh,just so you know not at this matters but,um, the baby isn't,you know,technically your blood. What-what do you mean? Whats "technical" here? Just that it's not my baby biologically,but you know,I don't even care,so. you mean you didn't get her pregnant? Well,no,not technically. Um,but that's not the point. The father's out of the picture and I'm here, so I want to raise the baby as if... what are you talking about?!Mom was raised by her stepdad! end of story. -But dad,you don't -end of story! Hey,you two. I'm naomi. You probably heard a lot about me. This is annie. Annie,this is liam. I'm bru-dog.What up? Sorry? Bru-dog. Old surf name that stuck. And you are a hottie,annie-dog. so,this is where you woo the ladies. Don't do too much wooing... unless the ladies insist on being wooed. well,it's a cute place. Two-dollar beers. What's better than that? One-dollar beers. so how was your day? Not bad. You know,I was actually thinking about bung a new car. Maybe you could advise me. Didn't you just get a new car? So,what kind of car were you thinking? I want a hybrid. I'm pretty pro-environment. Maybe you could get a bike then. Are you kidding? I can't tell if you're kidding. I'm kidding. right,yeah,funny.Me on a bike. Ah,nancy sutley would be into it. Totally,yeah,I know. You know what?I am going to run to the little girls' room. Remind me to give you my nancy sutley story when I get back. Another one coming up. You got someplace to be? oh,no. This is fun. You don't like me,do you? Oh,no,I like you just fine. Don't lie. Honestly,people who grunt one-word answers aren't really my cup of tea. But whatever floats your boat. Okay,look,I have a confession. I'm pretty shy around strangers because,when I was a kid,we moved around a lot. I was always meeting new people,and they would mock me and... make me feel insecure. I understand. I am probably bringing my own baggage to this. See,I once dated this guy named carl-dog, d anhe had this cousin who was a real ass,you know? He would try to screw with people and make them feel uncomfortable. I guess it was just to make himself feel better. Really quite pitiful andvery traumatic for me. naomi: Well,I'm back. What were we talking about? Oh,yeah,nancy sutley. Good choice for obama. She's such an expert on california's water and air problems. Good point. Hey,look,sorry I was being short earlier. I was just getting my bearings. So how was your day? Good. Not bad.I mean,I was completely consumed with this novel. I was almost late coming here. I just threw on whatever and dashed out the door. Well,"whatever" looks good on you. Brewskis from the bru-dog. navid: They're gonna come around. I don't know. They will. They have to. I... soad. much fun with you today. Bru-dog: And next,I'm gonna hit oaxaca. They're running rad double overheads with barrels big enough to drive a truck through. That'S... that's just rad. Naomi,time to go home. Right. Heel,boy. Later. Bye,guys. Hey,so, you were right. I was being a jerk earlier. not gonna argue. Come on. Can't you give me another shot? Fine. I will give you another shot. Over dinner next week? Just the two of us. you cannot marry adrianna and raise the child. Not in our guest house,not with our support. That is so hypocritical. Our family is full of step-kids. Honey, you're 16. I know the timing's not perfect... d, inavit's not up for discussion. Our decision is final. This doesn't mean that your relationship will end. You can still date adrianna. Just because you're not getting married, doesn't mean that you'll break up. I know this is hard. Your heart's in the right place, navid. Adrianna will understand. I'm just saying that if you end up with bru-dog and I end up with liam, we'll be cousins-in-law. I am not ending up with bru-dog. You never know,annie-dog. you know,I'm beginning to think that liam is really taking me seriously. Going on an actual date is a really big step forward in our relationship. Um,look,uh,I have to tell you something, and I know that it's really going to upset you, but we said that we would be honest with each other,so... liam asked me out. What? Yeah,um,when we were saying good-bye. It came completely out of the blue. Well,you musthave misunderstood. Yeah,but I didn'T. What did you say? Nothing. I-I just left. I would never do that to you. Not never. Never again. The guy's a jerk,naomi. Well,thank you for telling me. I appreciate it. I'm sorry. I know how much you like him. It happens. Can I just get a little privacy tonight? Yeah,sure,of course. I'll find somewhere else to sleep. Like my grandma's bed or something. Thanks. Hey,stop that. I'm doing the dishes,and you're just making them dirty again. How am iupposed to eat? Debbie: You're not.We already ate. Guys,can we keep it down a little bit? I'm doing my homework over here. Why don't you go upstairs and work in your room? Naomi's upstairs. She'll try to teach me how to french braid her hair... no,no,sorry. Annie: Hey,mom,do we have any extra blankets? Grandma's room is drafty and I'm sleeping there tonight. -Why? -It's no big deal. Na omi just had a really tough night and she needs some privacy. Annie... what?I said it was no big deal. Look,sweetheart,we know you want to help her out. Yeah,I do. She's going through a really hard ti. Harry: And we're sympathetic.But her living here... just not a long-term solution. Amen! What?What? You remember those jeans of mine that she didn't like? She cut them up. Into a million pieces. That's not normal behavior. Yeah,well,she probably thought that she was doing you a favor. She threw away my frozen salmon and filled the fridg with kobe beef. So let's try the kobe,see what all the fuss is about. What about the whole "principal boxer-shorts" nickname? You should have worn a robe! In my own bedroom? She was looking for toothpaste. Come on,you guys,where is your compassion? She has nowhere else to go. Debbie: I know that,honey. And we're not saying we're going to kick her out right away. We're not? Debbie: No,but we have to figure out a solution for her sake as well as ours. Okay. So when is she leaving? Shut it,dixie. Liam,did you do it? Did you ask annie out? Yeah,I did. What were you thinking? She's my friend.She'd never go out with you. Lo ok,that's who I am,naomi. A huge douche bag? Basically. I don't do the whole boyfriend thing. Which is why you should get out now. what? Nothing. why don't you let me take care of myself. Who knows maybe I have a little thing for jerks. Hey,erin. It's funny you looked familiar to me yesterday,but I couldn'tquite place you. And then,when I saw you with your boyfriend,it all came together. You're the whore from the video. Oh,no,please,don't take any offense to that. I didn't mean it in a derogatory way at all. You know,some people think that mary magdalene was a whore, and she was one of jesus's best friends. People can repent,erin; they can. Okay. Well...thanks. You know,I was so shocked when someone forwarded me the videoast month. You'd think catholic school people would be above that sort of thing, but they're always forwarding me things just trying to get my goat. Of course,I turned it off when you and your boyfriend began to fornicate. Erin... why did you really come to catholic school? Well... I made that video during a difficult period. And afterwards,I just wanted a fresh start. That's totally understandable. Thank you. And now I know why god brought us together. I am going to help you save your soul. First step: You have to tell everyone about your checkered past. Okay,yeah,actually,that'S... I really would rather not. No,I know you don't want to,but I guarantee you'll feel better if you come clean. Pretending to be someone that you're not it's basically lying. And god knows,because god is everywhere. Okay,well,I'll think about it. Lies separate us from our relationship with god. And,erin,I care about you. You know what? I'm going to fast. What? I won't eat. And I will pray every minute of every day until you come out of hiding and admit who you are and what you've done. Okay,that is a little bit extreme. I know it is,and the nuns,they may say I'm overzealous, but I feel anything I can do to help you get to heaven... oh,I have to do it. Silver: It's your fault. She knows,and it's your fault. Well,hold on,wait. Slow down. Who knows?What are you talking about? Angela. She knows about the movie. She saw it online last month,but she didn't put it together. Except then,she saw you yesterday,and now she knows that it was me... all right,silver,relax,calm down,all right? Are you having another manic episode? No! I'm allowed to have a bad day,okay?! I'm allowed to be upset that a video of me having sex went viral! I'm sorry. I know. I just wanted a fresh start, and now that's ruined because angela knows about the movie and she's fasting. Wait,hold on.What? She says that she's not going to eat again until I come out of hiding, and I tell everyone about my "checkered past. " Because that's going to bring me inner peace. Really? Yes.It's ridiculous. Not that ridiculous. What? Well,the fasting stuff is,obviously,but the stuff about how you have to stop hiding it's what you've been doing,silver. You're working so hard to keep this whole thing a secret. Oh,I'm sorry. What do you want me to do,send out some mass e-mail telling everyone, "hey,I made a sex video because I'm bipolar"? I'm not telling you to send out an e-mail. But you're going to have to do something to stop this girl from fasting. Right? No. You're just going to let her keep going? I'm not in charge of her. there's no end to what you'll do to avoid dealing with this. But you know what,I'm not even surprised. You already transferred schools. You're afraid to leave the house. You don't know what it's like. I don't? I have newfor you. I was in that movie,too. Only,instead of hiding,I dealt with all the whispering and all the looks. Which wasn't easy,by the way,but I did it. And you're going to have to figure out how to do that,too, if you're ever going to move on. I'm not surprised, navid. I mean, weere asking a lot from your parents. I'll just... I'll figure something else out. what are you doing? -I chose you. -What?! Navid,they're your family. They're not going to opyou're all that I want,and... wait,wait,this is not how it's supposed to go. How what's supposed to go? Well,our proposal was such a non-proposal,you know? So I was going to get my great-grandmother's ring after we told my parents. But plans changed,so this is from a pawnshop. I've loved you since the first time I saw you in e second grade. You had this ponytail,and all I ever wanted to do was pull it. and when you got the fifth grade,and you got your braces... oh,wow,let me just say,my heart stopped. But that's nothing compared to our first kiss. Which is bigger than the ponytail and the braces combined. I believe in us,ade. I can't imagine loving anyone else as much as I love you. Or feeling as close as... as I feel with you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you,ade. And the rest of habib's life. so,adrianna tate-duncan... will you please marry me? I want to. I love you so much. But, could you...? I have to tell you something first. And I know that this might change everything. And you might not want to marry me. But I have to tell you,because you're giving up so much and... and you deserve the truth. Ade... what are you talking about? The father of the baby... isn't a guy from rehab. It's ty. no,I-I-I I can't believe it. I-I was so scared. I thought that if I told you,you would just leave. No,y-you lied to me the whole time! I just,I... I've been walking around west beverly,talking to that guy. You know,every time I pick you up from play practice,I'm like,"hey,ty,what's up? " Like a fool! Who else knows? Just-just ms. Taylor and naomi. Naomi knew? I've given up everything for you,ade.Everything!My family... -I know!-No,it's the fact that you could lie to me to my... I know!I am so sorry,okay?! I don't know what to say except that I messed up. Which I used to do a lot of. And now I do a lot less because you make me a better person. Okay,but I-I still mess up sometimes. And yes,this was a big one,okay? And there really is no "and" except I am so sorry! I'm sorry! I told you I want to spend the rest of my life with you,ade... so don't ever lie to me again. And put this on your finger... and don't you ever take it off again. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. -I love you so much. -I love you so much. Naomi: And I don't know why mrs. Jackson was so upset. I was very discrete when I gave her the number for my waxer. It's not like I said,"you got a moustache,get it fixed. " Yeah,I guess some people are just ultra sensitive about that kind of thing. Sometimes school is just too much. Oh,liam doesn't like you,by the way. What? Oh,he's gun-shy about relationships; he's freaking out 'cause he's so into me. Classic self-sabotage stuff. He admitted that? Oh,he didn't have to; it was obvious. Psychology 101. all right,well,honestly,naomi,I think he might just be a creep. I know that's what he wants me to think,but I'm onto him. Okay. Just be careful. He's the one who should be careful. He doesn't think he's boyfriend material,but he's gonna be my boyfriend sooner or later. Jen! Darling! annie: Who's this? This is my sister! This is jen! well,don't just stand there.Grab some glasses. -okay. - Come on. Let's have a toast. : I'm baaack. Jen: The whole thing was so last minute. Naomi left me this frantic message about our father,so... I immediately hopped in a friend's private jet and voil? here I am to rescue her from bourgeois hell. Naomi: I know we all wish I could stay here forever,but it's just not practical. We totally understand. Totally. Actually,we don't smoke in here. Me neither. Cigarettes are for losers. I quit. Thank you for helping naomi cope with this dionysian debacle that is our father. I'll take it from here. Come. I have a town car outside and a hillside bungalow at the chateau marmont that'll do until we can find more permanent accommodations. Ciao. Can you help with my... -getting your stuff. -coming right up, well,I'm gonna miss you around here,you know. Yeah,I do. oh,hey,one thing. If you guys ever do a remodel around here,you might think about fixing the air ducts. Sound really travels. Trust me,someday dixon will be grateful that I cut up those awful jeans of his. God,you heard? Is that why you called your sister?
