I have been doing this parenting thing For a long, long time. Where is annie? I gave her the keys to my house In palm springs. Let me explain. You can try. She needed some alone time, some time away from the family. She's a teenager, And it isn't easy being a teenager. We forget-- it's very stressful. I did what I thought was best. You sent our daughter to palm springs alone? Now, don't get your hackles up, debbie. She's perfectly safe, I assure you. She's in palm springs. Your mother sent our daughter To her house in palm springs. Where I just installed A fancy-shmancy security system. Safety is one thing, but that's not even the point. Then what is the point? The point is that annie is our daughter, And you had no right to butt in. I know-- we live under your roof. But these are our children-- debbie's and mine-- And, mom, if you can't accept that, we can move out from under your roof Who knew liverould come in so many forms? Yeah, okay, so... Set menu, seven courses, this is number, what, three? With any luck, uh, we'll be Out of here by the time our college applications are due. Great. oh. My mom!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - What's going on?  - nothing, Nothing, I'm sorry. What? It's just... I just waited for this moment for so long And it's kind of incredible, you know. I'm just, I'm really kind of nervous. Well, tha-that's okay, that's normal. It's just... it's a big deal. Today I'm a virgin and tomorrow I won't be, And this is really, really important to me, And I always thought I would do it with someone That I really cared about, You know, someone who was the one, Maybe the one and only. And I think I found him. I'm sorry. What? I don't think I can do this. what if things of us don't work out What do you mean? you think we're going to break up? No, no, I just... What if something happens and... You and i... don't work And I end up hurting you? I don't want to hurt you. Too late. you just did. Ah! Ha, ha. Yo, navid, where's your girlfriend at? 'cause we could use someone with a hollow leg on our team. Or... Maybe she's only into harder stuff. Adrianna is clean, george, all right? She's a druggie, navid. Wake up and smell the blow. You shut up. Oh, my god, navid, stop it. Navid, stop it, he's not worth it. He's not worth it. What was that all about? It was about you, ade, all right? Are you defending my honor again? I'm sorry I got out of hand, okay? You know the rumors aren't true, right? Of course I know the rumors aren't true. Um... "um" what? You okay? It's not a good "um." I'm... Pregnant. You're pregnant? You're joking, right? It was before we were together. Hey, I'm just going to walk away. - No, no, please... - hey, no, don't even worry about it. - Please, please, please, don't. - I just have to go, okay? I just need some time to think, all right? I can't believe annie would go to palm springs Without asking us first. The lights are out. That is ethan's car. Ethan's car. Harry, remember the fancy- schmancy security system. Right. Careful. Oh, here. there he is. there's ethan. What's he doing? He's asleep on the couch by himself. Where's annie? Harry? Deb! Over here. There she is. Oh. in bed... asleep. By herself. What? Harry. what? What are we doing? I don't know. I don't know. It is probably good for her to have some time away from her parents. So you're saying we shouldn't just bust in there? I think not. You know, I think I've been second-guessing Myself in the parenting department lately. Why? because of sean? I guess. sorry. I know that that's made things harder on you. Well, your mother's tried to pick up the slack. As I said. It's okay. I guess we're all just trying to do our best. Even your mother. Although I can't say I mind getting away. I agree. You smell so good. What? Do I have sand on my face or something? No. Uh, no. I love you. Thank you. "thank you"? I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Just... forget it. What... I have to say something back? It's obligitory? Just... forget it, all right? And now you're mad at me. That's fantastic. One minute you love me, and the next minute you're mad at me? Whatever, silver. No. It's not fair. I didn't do anything. Why are you mad at me? Because I didn't say exactly what you said to me? Is that why you're mad? Because if that's what you want to do, I'll do it. Or you could just hold up some cue cards hey... Then I can read what you want me to say. You're overreacting. No, I'm not. I'm just reacting. But maybe not the way that you wanted, and I am sorry. Could you please not act like a freak? Is that what you think of me? a freak? Screw you, dixon! I guess we should get going, we got a long drive ahead of us. Yeah, well, at least the heat wave's over, right? Oh, my lord, my parents? Are here in palm springs? And they're blocking us in. Where... are they? Mom? Dad? Annie? Ethan. Mrs. wilson. Principal wilson. What are you doing here? I think that we could ask you that very same question. But we won't. So, I think we all have school today. Uh... then we should get going. Right. Right. You guys drive safe. You, too. Okay. Bye. You don't think they...? I don't even want to think about it. Harry. Ade. It's nice and cool in here. Yeah, thank goodness, huh? So, how did your walking go? Or is this a bad time? Do you need to walk some more? No, I'm good. you know, I walked enough. I think. And...? Ade, um... I want to tell you that I can do this, That I can handle this, that I can deal with Having a girlfriend... Who is pregnant by some other guy. Navid, I'm not really asking you for anything. Good. Um... 'cause i-i don't if I can do anything. Or be anything to you. I... I just really don't know how to handle this. Okay. I'm really sorry, ade. Listen... I'm sorry. It's all right, it's cool. Yeah? Sure. We'll just pretend it never happened. Okay. Sounds good. Uh... I better go. Okay. So, I'll see you later? Um... yeah, sure. Bye. The kids can have the car. Really? It was very generous of you And it will come in handy. But they have to pay for their own gas, And their own insurance. I'm putting my foot down about that. I am sorry, you know? I crossed the line. It's hard to know when to get involved and when to butt out. I want this to work. But we have to set some ground rules. That sounds good. I work well with structure. But it'll have to wait till I get back. From? Concord, massachusetts. I got the miniseries. I'm marmee osgood in red coats and blue bloods. Don't worry, deb. My decision had nothing to do with you. I need the work. I miss it. And I think you've got everything under control here. Thanks, tabitha. Ooh, and I'm glad you gave the kids a car. Because after what you two did in that minivan, I wouldn't want to drive it either. So I owe you an apology. These rumors about you being on drugs Is the last thing you need right now. Hey, it's not your fault. Yeah, actually... it is. I told the blendeds you were using again. It was before I knew about... you know... And they told everyone. Why would you say that? Because that's what I thought. I mean, I don't know, I was angry. Before, when you were using, I really wanted to help you. I reached out to you and you really hurt me. You lied and... you let me down. I know I did. And I'm sorry. So... Where do we stand? Well, I'm 16... I'm having a baby, So that makes me a walking statistic. And my boyfriend just broke up with me... What? Yeah, that's delightful. I'm all alone and I'm going through this. You're not alone, ade. Okay, I'm here, I'm really here. okay? And if you want to have this baby, I'll go with you to lamaze class. Or if you don't want to have it, I'll take you to the clinic. And if you can't decide, I'll sit with you until you can. If you'll let me. Thanks. Naomi, adrianna, We're waiting! Lay off the 'roids, you old freak-bag. Come on. Ethan? I need to talk to you. Uh, yeah, well, you didn't have much to say In the car ride home this morning. Last night... I wanted to be with you so badly, But... I freaked out Because it's not just sex with you. It's something more. Hearing those things, the emotions and stuff, That you attach to sex, It made me realize that I feel the same way. And I want it, but I just want to make sure That we have a strong... Whatever, foundation before we get there. So maybe we could slow things down a little? And, um, how do you propose we slow things down? Well, I propose a date. Just a typical, normal, boring high school date. No liver, no seven courses. Just a movie and some making out. What do you say? I say yes. I love you, annie wilson.
