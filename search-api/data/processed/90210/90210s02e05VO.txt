- Who is that white woman, and why is she hugging your boyfriend? You know that homeless guy that was killed? His nephew goes here. That's him. Jasper, wait. I'll go for a ride with you. - You will? - Naomi is your sister? Naomi will never believe that we slept together. We've waited long enough. Hey, Janine! Hey, Jordan, my man! Cool kicks, Alisa. And, Natalie, way to work that Bunsen burner in lab. Hey, man. Mr. Wong just slammed me with all kinds of homework. That was not funny. I was just thinking about something Adrianna said to me last night, after we did it. Right. Of course. Hey, what's the word? You guys have a good weekend? - I have a way to get Naomi back. - You serious? How? - Come on. - He doesn't want to talk about it, Leave him alone. My weekend was pretty awesome, too. - How come? - No reason. Why, do I seem different? Homeboy finally got laid. What's up with that? I was trying to keep it on the down low. But since the cat's out of the bag, it's true. This guy no longer a virgin. Finally talked Ade into it. I didn't have to talk her into anything. She came back from Beach Club, and she couldn't keep her hands off me. She showed up all, "I want you, Navid." So I gave the girl what she wants. - Gave her what she wants! - Put your hand down. - You've reached your high five limit. - Really? You know what? We should go on a double date. You and Ade and me and this little hottie from English class, Jasmine Lotan. You guys know her? She's cute. - You guys dating? - We will be once I ask her out. But seriously, it would be cool to double with you and Ade. Show Jasmine I'm friends with respectable couples. Sure, that sounds fun. Great. A lot of fun. What color is that? I love it. It's called Dulce de Leche. I'll get that, too. I've never been here before, Are they any good? Actually, this is my first time here, too. - We just moved nearby. - "We"? As in you and your boyfriend? Yeah, right. Me and my husband. You're married. Of course. How long you been married? 19 years. - 19 years? - I know. It's a long time. And I wouldn't believe it myself, except my kids are juniors in high school. I'm such a mom, I actually have pictures. I don't suppose you want to see them. Sure, why not? Here we go. This is my daughter, Annie. And this... is my son, Dixon. College is a big decision. As a junior, you've already started thinking about where you want to go. Right? Right. Exactly. I was gonna do you a favor and save you some time so you can focus on those kids in wood shop or read fashion magazines. I'll be going to California University. - CU is certainly a great school. - It's more than great. It's perfect, it's beautiful. It's where my grandfather went. He took me there. It's just like being on those east coast campuses except the weather's great and the people are good-looking. It's definitely important to know what you like, - but you need to think about... - I have thought about everything. I know exactly how my four years at CU will play out. Freshman year, I'll pledge Pi Phi no matter how much the DGs beg. And then sophomore year, that is when I'll find my Mr. Clark. He'll be a Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He'll probably play football... CU isn't going to happen. What do you mean? Your test scores aren't what they require. Neither are your grades. And you have no extracurricular activities. But I love it there. And I'm a legacy. I'm afraid that's not going to be enough. However, if you want to stay nearby, there are plenty of other schools that are within your reach. Places like Santa Monica Community College. "We're all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars." It's Oscar Wilde. Had a really good time the other night. - Stargazing. - Me, too. You got any plans after school? Thought I'd hit Chinatown. There's this dim sum place, my uncle used to take me there. I'd just really like to get back there. In his memory. Sure, I will come with you. This is the best meeting. There are a lot of celebrities. Can't tell you who they are because, it's anonymous, but let's just say say last time I was here, there was someone that rhymes with Ritney Rears. They also have the best donuts. None of that powdered sugar. I've seen actual fritters. But today is about you and your accomplishments. Six months sober, that's a big deal. Thank you so much for coming to support. It means so much. Of course. We would not miss it for the world. - Let's go get some fritters. - No, you stay. I'm gonna go. Just in case you need muscle to get to the front of the line. You know how proud I am of you? Yes, I do. - He's so sweet, right? - Yeah, he is. You're lucky to have such a great boyfriend. I know. I am. Really lucky. I agree. Here you go. One apple, one pear. - Thank you, sweetie. - I'm gonna find us some seats. Oh, my God. - I have to go. - Why? I'm sorry. I'll call you later. What happened? Who is that woman? Silver's mom. Go away and don't come back. - Why? - Why? Because you're a junior in high school, that's why! How...? How did you...? - I can explain. - Explain what? That you're not 17? - I am, but... - But what? I feel like such a fool. I cannot believe I was actually falling for a high school kid. Stay away from me. I'm serious. Just stay away. Peach Pit Team S02E05 Environmental haszrds - You forgot your fritter. - Come on in. Thanks. I'm sorry I left the meeting. I just couldn't deal. I totally get it. Your mom got a chip tonight. 30 days sober. Good for her. She talked to me after. Said she really wants to see you. She's changed. Like I haven't heard that before. I know. I'm just saying, she seems really different. She's an addict. And once addicts sober up, they become different people. When I think about what I used to be like: so sneaky, manipulative, - a liar... - And you changed? Really? What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Just forget it. You obviously meant something. What is it? What? I saw you kiss Teddy. I made a mistake. Please don't tell Navid. I'm not going to. But you should. These things, they don't just go away. You think that they will, you want them to, but they don't. Trust me. Look at what the kiss with Ethan did. That was a different situation. - No... - Yes, it was. You were confused, you didn't even know who you liked. Me, I'm not confused. I... made a mistake, and move on, pretend like it didn't happen. It's not going to work. It's really none of your business. Maybe you should just stay out of it. Joseph Campbell got the term "monomyth" from Joyce. He also called it "The Hero's Journey." Who are some heroes that have famous monomyths? There's Buddha, there's Moses, Christ, Luke Skywalker, Ryan Matthews. I just got this phone. Have you downloaded the beat app yet? - Give it back. - Let me show you how to get to it. Don't touch anything. Just give it back. I'll take the phone. No, I'll just put it away. Give it to me. You'll get it back at the end of class. Come on, that's not fair. Write about it. Your own personal monomyth. Why are you wearing sweatpants? Are you okay? Since I'm not going to CU, I'll probably end up working at a fast-food joint, so might as well dress the part. You're mad at me, but we have a much bigger problem. Oh, my God. Naomi's wearing sweats? What? I don't know. - Can I have my...? - I wanted to talk about your paper. What's the problem with it? There is no problem. It's great. The L.A. Times is sponsoring a essay contest and you should enter. - I made suggestions for revision... - Do I have to enter? - You don't have to. - Cool. Then I'll pass. Can I just have my phone? I don't get you, Liam. You're a smart kid. - Is it not cool to care? - Find another special project, 'cause it's not going to be me. Just give me back my phone. "Give me back my phone"? Sorry. Give me back my phone, please. Absolutely. At the end of the day. What! Looks like I found something you care about. Sure you don't want to even up the teams? - You against me? - You want to break? I just can't believe it's over between us. - I'll just break. - You know what's gonna help? Death? That or this super hot chick from my history class. She might not be a cool deejay with an unbelievable amount of sports knowledge, but she does have some really nice, curves. Nice. Honestly, guys, I can't accept that's the last time I'm gonna see her. And I know Sasha's going through it, too. I know she's torn up. She told me she was starting to fall for me. Really? 'Cause if she said that, you've still got a chance. He doesn't. Sorry, but you don't. Sure he does... it's like me and Naomi. Right, like that mysterious plan you haven't implemented yet? Technical difficulties. The point is, if you like someone and they like you, there's a way around obstacles. Like if Dixon went into a rapid aging machine. - What's your problem? - I don't want you to get your hopes up. - She's done. - Why not give it another shot? What's he got to lose? I mean, what do I have to lose? Did you guys just drag me here for lunch to torture me? I should be getting used to double-beef burgers and the fryolator. We are not torturing you. We are inspiring you. This is your dream. Come on, how many times have you done pilates - to the CU fight song? - Who cares. I'm done with it forever. Why, because some jaded college counselor said you won't get in here? Come on you are not a quitter. When have you ever taken no for an answer? This morning, at the coffee shop. They were out of soy. You should have made them get more. Because that's who you are. Remember at Herm√®s when they were all sold out of the Birkin bag? - What'd you do? - I called the regional manager, demanded they have the salesgirl fired. Exactly. And then what happened? - They tracked down the bag. - And? And I bought two... the blue calfskin, the brown crocodile. Right, because you are Naomi Clark. When somebody says you can't have something, you get them fired. Which, for the record, I do have a problem with, but you don't, so it doesn't matter. You go after what you want and you don't take no for an answer. What the...?! Sorry about that. You have a good arm. You're right. You're right! I'm not going to let some college counselor, who wears an ankle bracelet under her stockings, get in my way. I just have to find a way to get into CU. And I will. That's what we wanna hear. Oh, my God! I'm wearing sweatpants! The only thing that would make me happier is if you had a refrigerator right by your bed. With a pot roast inside. I'm so famished. But I'm thinking more like fried chicken and waffles. I forgot to tell you. Say you have Roscoe's in your book bag, and all is forgiven. No, but it is about food. It's about dinner actually. Teddy asked us to double date with him and some chick. What? No. I don't want to double date. Why not? Because... I would rather just be with you alone. Me, too, but he already asked. So just say no. I already told him yes. He wants to impress a girl. He asked me for a favor. It's one night. What's the big deal? Fine. What are you doing? You were supposed to give me back my phone, but you weren't here, so... So you just started going through my desk? I got important stuff on it. That can't get erased. You just got yourself a week's detention. Move. That is so unfair. I wouldn't have had to go through your desk If you'd been here... You didn't have to do anything. You shouldn't have taken my phone. - Let's make it ten days of detention. - What is this about? - Is this about your stupid contest? - Excuse me? - Why are you being such an a...? - That's it. I am sick of your attitude problem. Your parents told the school to call - if we had any problems with you. - Wait, what? And this qualifies. So we're all going to have a little sit-down. - I'll take the detention. - I'm sorry. It's too late. You don't understand. My stepdad is a jerk. Everybody's a jerk. Your stepdad, me. I got a thought for you. Maybe we're not the problem. Maybe it's you. Hey, you. What's going on? What does it look like? I'm studying to get into CU. That's awesome. Little known fact, huge corollary between studying and raising your grades. Who said anything about grades? I did a little research on the Dean of Admissions. Her son goes to CU. He's an S.A.T. tutor. - So I hired him. - Cool. You're going to focus on the SATs? I'm gonna date the Dean's son. Honestly, Silver, try to keep up. Once we start dating, Well, he'll take me home to Mom... naturally I'll charm her instantly. Eventually, dear Richard and I will part amicably, but not before the Dean and I have forged a lasting bond. The type of bond that will guarantee me a place at CU in the fall of 2011. Don't you think it's just a little bit easier to... I don't know... study? The key to success is knowing one's strengths. I am terrible at tests. But I'm an excellent dater. Unfortunately, Richard is a bit of a snooze-fest. His Facebook says he's some super environmentalist. So I have to read all these global warming books to make him think we have stuff in common. Easy on the pours. Seriously, we're in a drought here. What do you think? Sounds like I care about the environment, right? Please, listen, just hear me out. All right, and afterwards if you want me to get lost, I'll get lost. Forever. I bought you a pizza. 'Cause when we met at the pizza parlor we didn't know each other's ages. All we knew was that we liked each other. And yes, when I found out that you were older, I lied. Which was a really, really stupid thing to do. The only reason why I lied, was because I couldn't believe that a girl as cool, as down-to-earth... and as beautiful as you existed. But you want to know something? Although I feel terrible about lying, I'm actually glad I did. Because if I would have told you I was 17, you would have never gone out with me. So yes, I lied about my age, but all the things that we talked about, everything, all the stuff about how I was feeling, how you were feeling, none of that was a lie. So I'm here because I'm hoping maybe we can start over. No more lies. Just you and me... and half sausage, half pepperoni. Get lost. "Please come to the meeting tonight. I'm speaking. I really want to make things right with us. Love, Mom." Right on the dashboard? So, are you gonna go? I have no idea. You haven't seen Metropolis? That's even more egregious than your lack of experience with Dim Sum. Don't I get credit for trying chicken feet? I popped back, like, three of those suckers. You're right. Credit gained. And then it's deducted for your staggering cinematic naivete. And no, Annie, I'm sorry, but Kansas, it's not an excuse. You've lived in L.A. for, like, a year. I guess I've been hanging out in the wrong scene. Yeah, no kidding. It's gonna blow your mind, Metropolis. It's huge. It's all about man versus society. Big influence on the movie I'm making. You're making a movie? Half narrative, half documentary, half really just sick experimental stuff. Think like, Matthew Barney meets, Michael Moore. Cool. Actually there's, there's a band playing tonight, The Script. Thought I might use them for part of my score. Do you... want to come? - Where are they playing? - The Beach Club. I will pass. Most of the people I hate hang out there, so... What if I guaranteed you wouldn't have to see any of them? Then would you go? - Are you Richard? - Naomi, hi. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late. They really should repaint the bike lanes by the Shrine. You rode your bike here from Beverly Hills? Just doing what I can to reduce my carbon footprint. That's impressive. No, stop. No, seriously, I feel like I'm surrounded by people who don't care about the Earth. They just guzzle water from plastic water bottles... How do they sleep at night? No idea. You know what, I wish we could put pictures of choking dolphins on the bottles. I think maybe then they'd think twice about using them. Choking dolphins would be awesome. Before we get started with vocab, do you know where the Independent Theater is around here? I heard there's a showing of <i>FLOW,</i> and I just wanted to see if I could catch it later tonight. FLOW as in For Love Of Water? I tried catching the re-release last night, but they were sold out. Rumor has it that you'll never view water politics the same way again. Well, hey, you should come. I mean, I have another ticket. You know, I'm your tutor. I'm not sure that's appropriate. Come on, it's not a date. It's just two like-minded individuals going to see a film about something they're passionate about. Plus, I hear it's kind of one of those flicks you've got to see on the big screen. Kind of like <i>The Dark Knight.</i> God, you're tempting me. Yeah, you know, what the hell. It's just one movie. Great. Vocab. - Sorry we're late. - Hey, no worries. - How are you, buddy? - Good, man, how you doing? What, no hug? Oh, of course. Guys, this is Jasmine. Jasmine, this is... Hey, I'm Adrianna. And Navid. Have a seat. Jazz... just moved to L.A. from Kauai. No kidding. Sweet. Ade, you went there once, right? With your mom? - Yeah, a long time ago. - Yeah, I remember. When she came back, she would not take off her lei. I'm telling you, this thing was not only wilting, but it was actually starting to stink. You know, my family actually vacations In Kauai every Christmas. Right on. Whereabouts? North Shore. It's like, one of the most beautiful... I'm starving! Should we look at the menu? Sure. Hey, honey, do you want to order two dishes and split? Yeah, sounds good. Can I get you guys something to drink? I think I'll have an iced tea. No, make that an Arnold Palmer. I'm good with water. I think we're all good for water. Okay, great. - Oh, babe. - Oh, my God... I got it. Don't worry about it. I am very impressed, Liam. It only took a month for us to get called into school. You held it together a whole lot longer than I thought you would. Sweetheart, I know this is tough for you but we had an agreement. - If he screwed up one more time... - I know, Sweetheart, we gave him a shot. We let him move back into the house, but obviously it's not working. Some kids are just bad seeds, you know? Liam is one of those. Jeffrey Sarkossian. This is my wife, Colleen. Ryan Matthews. Nice to meet you. Look, I wanted to apologize ahead of time for whatever trouble Liam got himself into. Trouble? Liam hasn't gotten into any trouble. Listen, the reason I called you both down here was to tell you in person how great Liam's been doing. His first paper was terrific. It was insightful, well structured, beautifully written. Oh, honey. You should be very proud of him. Okay, everyone, welcome. My name is Tim, and I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Tim. Sorry, I'm late. So... what you did... that was cool. The ten days of detention still stand. Yeah, okay. Your phone. Thanks. That essay contest thing. Did I miss the deadline? Nope. Three days left. Cool. So I hiked the waterfall. Of course, I thought it was three miles instead of nine. And I ran out of water, and... I vomited. I gotta go to the ladies' room. I'll be right back. Okay, sure, babe. Do you want to try any French onion soup? - What's wrong with you? - What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about. Why would you ask Navid and I on a double date? Just thought it'd be fun. Yeah, right. And you had to make out with Jasmine right in front of me. Really? I'm sorry. Did that bother you? It's interesting because - you know what bothered me? - What? Having to listen to Navid brag about having sex with you right after we kissed. So this is about getting revenge? What do you care who I make out with? You've got a boyfriend, remember? I know I have a boyfriend. I don't need you to remind me. So why are you acting so jealous? I'm not acting jealous! It's just really annoying because I know that you're trying to make me jealous. So what if I am? - It's obviously working. - It's not working. It's pathetic. Okay, you know what? I really could care less. - Kiss whoever you want. - Okay fine. Fine. You shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry you're not feeling good. - You still want me to come over? - No, I just need to sleep. Sure everything's okay? Everything's fine. Am I not allowed to have a headache? Yeah, of course. Sorry. You look like you're lost. I'm looking for Reed Tower. I'm going that way. Come on. Thank you. I'm Jamie, by the way. I take it you don't go here? No, I'm going to apply. Yeah, you should, it's the best. And you, you are a Pi Phi waiting to happen. So, you're psychic? Psychic, SAE pledge... same thing. Yeah, we... know things. Like what? Like... I know when I see someone I have to meet. Why do you think I threw my football at you yesterday? What, you thought that was an accident? No, my arm is pretty damn accurate. Don't think I would've made it on the football team otherwise. So, you're on the team. Would you want to come to a game sometime? There you are. I was afraid you got lost. I was actually just asking for directions. - Jamie, this is... - My roommate Richard. So, we should get going if we want to catch the bus. So, these guys are from Ireland? Cool. I'm sorry, man. Just... not really in the best mood. Hoping that music gets my mind off Sasha. No problem. - So, what do you want to drink? - Whatever. - What are you doing here? - Look, I just came for the music. I had no idea you were going to be here. The musicians are friends of mine. Adult friends. I'm sorry. Let's go. You want to split? So, thanks, everyone, for coming down. We're The Script from Dublin, and the song we're going to do is called "We Cry." Let's just stay for the set, you know? - Then we'll bounce. - All right. Told you we could hear the music - without seeing anyone you hate. - It's perfect. What? Nothing. Nothing. Just... Thank you for this. And I have let down... so many people over the years I've lost count. But the ones that I regret hurting the most are my children. I was such a terrible mother. Which is why I'm so grateful that... one of my daughters is here tonight. Thank you, honey, for giving me another chance. I promise you, I will not let you down again. I'd like to say something, if I could. Go ahead. Please. I really wanted to be here tonight so that I could tell my mother, once and for all, to stay away from me. Everything that she said? Trust me, it's going to last until she's a bad day. Then she's going to go back to the bottle or, the pills, whatever she can get her hands on. But you did get one thing right, Jackie. You were a terrible mother. The worst of the worst. And if you think that you can buy me back with a car... That's just proof that you don't know me at all. Stay away from me. I mean it. You're dead to me. Let's just go, man. It's hard being in the same room as her. Yeah, it's cool. Actually... - give me ten minutes. - When did she get here? I don't know. But I got to act while I got an opening. Go do your thing, man. - You already talked to her? - There's nothing to talk about anymore. I'm too late. She moved on. Let's just get out of here. Where are you going? That kiss wasn't appropriate for a tutor. I'm sorry. I know this is not supposed to be a date. I'm just having such a good time. Me, too. I got to say, you really surprised me. When I first heard "Beverly Hills," I thought, "Great. She's going to be about clothes, and hair, and makeup." Man, was I wrong. You're... pretty unique, you know? You, too. You must have pretty inspiring parents. What are they like, by the way? My parents? Pretty normal. My... dad's a radiologist. And my mom's actually the Dean of Admissions at CU. Really? I had no idea. Naomi will never believe that we slept together.</i> I really... need to talk to you. And I'm sorry for the way I acted. Call me back, okay? Hello? This is the last time, okay? We're just saying good-bye. Ade, are you okay? Is it the Teddy thing? It didn't go away, did it? I mean yes, you were right, it didn't. That's not why I'm here. Silver, we're friends. Okay? We have to stay in each other's lives. I know. I'm sorry that we fought. Your mom called me. Ade, let it go. She just wanted advice on how to get through to you. She shouldn't have bothered you. No, you don't understand. She told me something you don't know. Please. There's nothing that that woman could tell you that will make me change my mind.
