Calling me "child molesting pervert" on your blog, and almost costing me my job. Did you seen what she wrote? She got carried away, she's a kid. So... I'm back in your class? Yes. Hi, Naomi. See that's not fair. You know my name, but I don't know yours. Leo. What if you if you send him a bottle of champagne, telling him to meet you by the pool? I just knew that I wanted to stop thinking... so I took all my mom's sleeping pills. Annie. Tell us a story of your life. Something really painful... I took the sleeping pills from my mom's, in the medicine cabinet. It wasn't a story, it's her life! I know. What I did was wrong, and I am ashamed of myself... I love you, and I wanna be with you. I wanted to get something permanent to symbolize our love. I wanna introduce you to a student who will be joining this class. You're in high school? My mom had to sign for that bottle of champagne you sent over, which sort of tipped her off that I wasn't enrolled here. Hey, can we talk? Look, I'm sorry I sent the champagne to your house, I didn't mean to get you in trouble. I thought that you lived alone. Whatever, it doesnt matter anyway. I just... it was a really stupid thing to do, and I'm sorry. Can we start over? Hey. I'm Naomi. Hi, Naomi. Turn off the phone. Hello? Good morning Miss Clark. It's 7:30. Yes, I know. I'm... I'm wide awake. Thank you. Have a nice day. Bye. The right shoe... where's my left shoe, I can't find my left shoe. Can't you relax? I can't relax we just had sex in the media lab. I know, I was there. What if someone had walked in? It would have been jealous or impressed perhaps excited, in the case of that pervert janitor with the lazy eye. Well, the lazy janitor's gonna have to get his kicks elsewhere. I'm the principal's son. I can't get caught like this. So, media lab... much better than under the stairs, but worse than the cafeteria. Where do you want to try next? Some place really freaky. I think of one. Tell me, baby. How about a bed? A bed? In a furniture shop? No. Oh, a sunbed? A bed of roses. Huntington Gardens, I love that idea. Hey, what's up? Come on, don't do that to me. So, uh... So I have uh, a ** that Mrs. Winters is gonna give us a pop quiz today. Whenever it rains, the next session gets a pop quiz. Maybe, the humidity makes it vengeful, or... hey, can you... wait up? Your legs are longer than mine, it's not fair. Oh, sorry. Ethan, is this ever gonna end? What? This. This... you being mad at me, and me apologizing over and over and over again. You can stop apologizing, I hear you. Then what? What is it? I don't know. I just... feel like... I don't know... like I don't know you. Because of this one thing? Because I told Rhonda's story? When I was watching you tell her story, I was horrifying but... I was also impressed. You are really a very good actress, Annie. I had no idea who you were. And that makes me wonder who we are. So try to think about these poems in terms of positive and negative space. The positive space is the... it's the words, and the negative space is the meaning that we impose on those words. You know, rarely there's a poem come right out, and say something straight forward No kidding. That's the problem. Not a problem... it's a beauty. You know, it's up to us to interpret poems, to understand them, to make them valid. So, please... I beg you don't let your poems down. Not that any of you will wait till the last minute but just a friendly reminder: your poetry presentation is due begin tomorrow. I gotta say: I am loving this assigment Matthews! When do we lose the "Mr"? Do I not command respect? This poem that you assigned me, I absolutely love it. Lord Byron. But I'll be straight with you. I never really liked love poems before you know, they're so like over the top and... and grandiose or sappy or full of crap, you know? I will take that as a metaphor. I never really got them you know. It's, like, my love is like a rose. Your eyes are like a filthy swimming pool. Not familiar with that one. Poetry was this foreign language to me, okay? But now, I get it. And I don't know if it's because I actually know what love is, or because you somehow broke through this thick skull of mine, but suddenly, these poems... It's, like, they're not gibberish anymore. Love is like a rose. It is. Silver, I do believe you're inspired. Yeah, I also believe you could lay off the coffee a little bit. Okay, I wanted to check with you. I want to show a film as my presentation. I've been working on it, and I'm fairly sure it's going to blow your mind. Sounds good. I take it you're familiar with all the equipment in the media lab? You have no idea how familiar I am with that equipment. What formula would you use to find the volume, hmm? Mr. Court. So glad you've decided to join us. Would you like to tell us what formula you would use to find the volume of a triangular prism? No idea. It's one-half times length times width times height. That ring a bell? Nope. Well, where did you leave off in your last math class? Do you know how to figure out the area of a rectangle? How to classify triangles? Okay, well, it looks like you have to play a little catch-up. Who would like to go over past exams with liam? For extra credit, of course. You? I could really use the extra credit. Okay. What kind of guy drop out of high school to work as a bartender? I mean, what kind of guy barely speaks to you before he throws you up against a wall and starts to... Show you the banana in his pants? Yeah, that was a dream. I know that, okay? I don't have a lot to work with. He's a complete enigma. Well, you know what they say. The way to a man's heart is through math. What was I supposed to do? I have to get him to forgive me. I mean, if it was Ethan, I'd just give him pot stickers. Those always put him in a good mood. God, but I don't know anything about Liam. I mean, I don't know where he stands on the whole pot sticker spectrum. Okay, well, putting a pin in the pot sticker issue... Did you Google him? Um, hi. Of course I did. He has no digital footprints. No MySpace, no Facebook. Well, how does he superpoke people? He's a complete mystery. Josh in my history class says he's in a gang. No, no, no, no. That doesn't seem right at all. He's a complete loner. And I definitely couldn't see him wearing a doo rag. Did you hear about the cooking meth rumor? Yeah, from Sally. She also said she went on a date with Rob Pattinson. Yeah, she's clearly full of it. Hopefully, I'll find out so real information from him today during the tutoring session. Yeah, not this afternoon, you won't. Your enigma viis dring away. Hey, Spielberg, I got to get through. Enjoy. Here. Look at me. Look at me. And... got it. Now I'm dizzy. So, what was that shot for? Okay, that's a shot when the heroine experiences love for the first time, you know, and her entire world just starts spinning. That's pretty cool. Far be it from me to toot my own horn, but... By all means. Toot away. Dixon, it's crazy. The moment that I decided to do the poem as a film, this whole entire concept just came to me. Scene by scene and shot by shot, I knew exactly what I wanted to do, you know? I can't wait for you to see it. What's next? Uh, well, I do need to refuel. So, what can I get you? How about... An order of Dixon? Dressing on the side? Hey, you and me in the storage room,right now. I'm working. You work in a service industry,right? All right, you know, I gotta go on break in a minute, so... You don't think this is too big for the kitchen? No. Did I ever tell you that you are the love of my life? I think the last time was when I was carrying a gigantic teak bookshelf up the stairs. What can I say? Seeing you carry heavy objects reminds me how much I love you. That plant is too big for the kitchen. Annie! What are you doing home? You're supposed to be at rehearsal. I... I quit. What? Why would you quit? You know, it was such a small part. It really wasn't worth my time. Well, come on, what is it they say? There are no small parts, just small actors. Yeah, well, whoever said that got the lead. Besides, I'm not sure that being in the play is good for me and Ethan, so... What do you mean? It's not a big deal, okay? There will be other plays. And I just need to focus on my relationship right now. Do something. What do you want me to do? Tackle her and force her to go to rehearsal? I don't know. But she should be focusing on herself and... and what's important to her and not making decisions based on some boy. I agree. Well, then, let's do something. Ground her or forbid her from seeing Ethan. Honey, really? No! Yes. I don't, I don't know. And don't "honey" me. She is making a huge mistake. And you are refusing to do anything about it. And that plant is way too big for the kitchen. Geez, Matthews, you scared me. Sorry about that. Uh, I'm just taking off for the night. I wanted to see how you're doing. I... I'm great, actually. This project has made me realize that I want to be a filmmaker. I'm going to make movies. Wow, that's cool. You know, I gotta say, I like movies better than blogs. It totally makes sense.I... I've always been a sual person, it's just, I'm crap at painting and drawing. So, film is this perfect medium for me. You know, I don't have to create the image, I just have to capture it and then connect them. Well, just thank me at the oscars. You got it. So, look... I know everybody gets ten minutes for their presentation, but I can't cut it down to that. I mean, maybe if I make some really big trims I can get it down to 45 minutes. What do you think? Are you out of your mind? Aim for ten. All right? We have other students in the class. You just lost your oscar shout out. Well, I'll survive. Oh, good, you're awake. Silver, what are you doing here? Morning, baby. I'm gonna rock your world. Wait, uh... Um, what are you doing? What do you think? I don't know. Wait, you wanna have sex? Here? You're the one who wanted to do it in a bed. Yeah, but my parents are right down the hall sleeping. That's funny, I didn't sleep a wink. But I finished my movie. And baby... it's a masterpiece. Now, I'm ready to celebrate. Whoa, hey, Silver. Uh, take it easy. My movie, it's all about love! And you are my inspiration. Um, well, um, let me inspire you later, cool? Dixon, you are gonna freak out when you see my film. I mean, of course I ran into a little glitch ' cause Matthews is insisting on the under-ten-minute thing. But then I realized, it's gonna be wasted on a classroom anyway. So, I'm gonna rent a theater! A... are you kidding? I mean, it's a little bit expensive, but it's a huge investment for my future and you're gonna come to the screening, right? Um, yeah, yeah, um, long as my parents don't find you in here. 'Cause dead people can't go to screenings, you know. You are so cute when you're nervous. I'm much much, much less cute if I'm dead, trust me. That's fine,fine. I wonder if scorsese has such a hard time getting morning action. It's gonna be amazing! Love you! I love you,too. Come on, come on. You will give me coffee. Morning, dad. When the machines finally wage war against their human oppressors do you think that they are gonna start big... super computers, subway system, or do you think they're gonna send out the foot soldiers? You know, electric pencil sharpeners, digital clocks, coffee makers. Coffee makers? Never mind. Just the ravings of a caffeine-deprived luddite. You all right? Yeah, yeah, sure. Just... just thinking. You know, why is it so hard to understand women? And thus the beginnings of another classic comedy routine. Sorry, mom, no offense. None taken. What's with the coffee maker? I think it's busted. Women troubles? No, no, no, no, no, uh... Silver's just very emotional. You know, she's so over the top with things. Well, she is a teenager. And a woman. What's that supposed to mean? Have you tried plugging it in? See? Women may be crazy emotional, but sometimes they are great with gadgets. You think women are crazy emotional? Well, come on, hon. That thing with annie yesterday.You got upset with me for no good reason. It struck a nerve. This whole idea of a young woman giving up what she cares about for the man in her life. I guess sometimes I just feel like I've given up too much of my photography. Well, I... I never wanted you to give up anything. I know. I wanted to take a bit of a break to help us get adjusted to California and everything. But now I'm missing it. Somewhere there's that elusive balance between family and career. And right now that balance is a little t off. Went to school. Peace, D. I think that we missed the opportunity to give a very inspirational parental pep talk. Rhonda. Hey, look, sorry I've been sort of... Avoiding you, but I just... Wanted to sort things out in my head before I talked to you. Okay, so you're all sorted then? I have a girlfriend. And yes, we're going through a rocky patch, but we're trying to work it out. Great, well, I'm thrilled for you both. No, I still want us to be friends, though. Well, I'm sorry, Ethan, but it's not up to you. Being friends is not what I want. We had a connection, and you can deny it all you want. But it was still there. No, I'm not denying it. But I'm with Annie. And that's that. Well, I can't just pretend that I don't have feelings for you. And that's that. So, where does that leave us? I guess that we're just... Not friends. What are you doing here? I'm here to tutor you, remember? You ditched me yesterday. That's 'cause I don't need a tutor. Look, Liam, I'm really sorry about the champagne. I feel really bad. It was an honest mistake. I didn't mean to get you in trouble. Can we just start over? Hi, I'm Naomi. What do you want from me... Naomi? Nothing. So, why are you here? I'm here to tutor you in math. Of course. Of course. Well, knock yourself out. Great, um, so, we'll just ,uh, start with the basics. We're studying angles. There's different types of angles. These two are not acute. Not acute? No, they, um... acute angles are less than 180... less than 90 degrees, I mean. Uh, these are congruent. Supplementary. What? Interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary. They need to be on opposite sides of the transversal to be congruent. How do you know that? I told you. I don't need a tutor. Now, I would love to hear you take a whack at obtuse angles, but I got to take off. So, how about you get off my car? What do you say you take me with you? It's not your kind of scene. I'm willing to take that risk. Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you. You're in for a long ride. Please un-quit the play. We desperately, desperately need you. I can't. Why not? This whole acting thing, it's messing with me. Doesn't it feel weird constantly putting yourself in someone else's brain? Are you kidding? I love it.It takes me out of my own. Yeah, well, I... I don't want to forget who I am right now. I can't. I got to get back to being the girl that Ethan fell in love with. This is about Ethan. Kind of. We're having problems. Um, something really bad happened the night of the valentine's dance. Yeah, I know, I heard. You did? How? Well, Navid, he kind of saw. Navid saw? Wait, what are you... what are you talking about? You first. What exactly did Navid see? Oh, I... well, I don't even know if it's... it's true. Navid's vision does weird things at night. Adrianna... He thought he saw a baby alien once, and it turned out to be a squirrel. Adrianna, what did he see? He saw Ethan and Rhonda kissing in the parking lot after the valentine's day dance. I cannot believe you fooled around with my boyfriend. Um, can we... can we go somewhere? You are such a hypocrite, the both of you. Going... going around talking about honesty and how the accident changed you and all the great things you want to do to expand your horizons. Little did I know that expanding your horizons was actually code for becoming a lying, cheating whore. Okay, look, I am not that kind of girl. I thought you guys were over. Well, guess what, we're not. Yeah, I know. Ethan explained that things have been kind of rocky between you two. He also said that as long as he had a girlfriend that nothing was gonna happen between us. Great. So, you're just lying around, ready to pounce? No, of course not. I totally get why you're mad, but this isn't a conversation to have with me. It's a conversation you need to have with your boyfriend. It's me. I heard about you and your valentine. I'm so angry, I can't even find words. Except I can. Yeah, a couple. Like "liar" and "cheater. Great work tonight, you especially. Excellent. Ms. Casey? Hi, um... so, look, I... I made a mistake in quitting the play. I don't even know what I was thinking. Well, I do, but I think differently now, and I would really like to play Charmian again. Is it too late? I'm sorry, Annie. Cammy Zuggler is... is now playing Charmian. Maybe next semester. Are you okay? She wouldn't let me back in the play. No, I meant about the Ethan stuff. I'm really sorry. Why? You didn't kiss Rhonda. Yo, Annie. Juno. A bunch of us are going to go hang at Griffith Park. You want in? Negatory. I have a date with Navid. Annie? I'll go. Hey, it's me. I heard about you and your valentine. Hey, what's going on? It's good to see you. Hey, Mary, hey, Kendra. Welcome. Thanks. Hi, ladies. Where is everyone? I put a big invite on my blog. Well, it was kind of last minute. Our school is full of losers. What could they possibly have going on tonight? Sir Matthews, welcome. Way to get around the time limit. Well, I didn't want to butcher the narrative. Yeah, well... Geez, I'm excited. Oh, I have an idea. Um, will you do, like, a little introduction before the film? You know, like... kind of like they do at the arclight? Yeah, sure, why not? You are the best teacher ever. I've been trying to reach you oh, oh... So, when did you stop going to school? Oh, me and my mom moved here in January, so...January. How did you do it? She told me to enroll at West Beverly. I didn't. How were you gonna cover up all the report cards and stuff like that? My mom's not really the report card type. So long as I'm going, she's happy. When she found out I wasn't... Not so happy. I don't get it. I mean, you're obviously smart. Why not go to school? School bores me. The bell rings, and the cattle move from room to room every 45 minutes. I'm all for learning. Just not exactly what they want me to learn or how they want me to learn it. See, I'm an autodidact. Means self-taught. Yeah, I know what it means. Sure. There's a whole world of knowledge and experience out there, things that you don't learn at school. That's what I'm interested in. So, where are we, exactly? A long way from Beverly Hills. You scared? What? No, of course not. Then why are you clutching your purse so tight? This purse happens to be worth more than your car. This is a v-8 engine. 360 horsepower, 500 pounds of torque on tap. I can guarantee it's worth more than that purse. Naomi, I'm about to race these guys, so your little adventure ends here. Drag racing. That's what you autodidact yourself about? Racing is physics. And math. And a hell of a lot of fun. But it's also dangerous and illegal, so I'm going to call you a cab. What do you think? I think... I'd rather go for a ride. Uh, hello, everybody. Uh, I would like to introduce the first film, uh, from a new auteur. The, uh, inspirational... the enthusiastic... the unusual Erin Silver. Um, uh, it's been a pleasure teaching her and, um... and... and I look forward to teaching her more in the future. And you what that said, enjoy. Can't wait to see it. She walks in beauty That's pretty cool. I'm in it? I love you. Oh, my God! You filmed us having sex? Are you upset? I love you. What's wrong with you? Allright, that's enough, let's shut it down. Dixon, Dixon. Wait! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Come on! Go faster! Go! Faster! Faster! Go!Go! Oh, my God, he's gaining on us! Floor it! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Oh, my God. That was so fast. That's the idea. So, what's next? Beer. Do you guys have wine spritzers? That was a joke. Dixon! Wait! Please! I honestly thought that you would like my movie, okay? You thought I would like it? It's about our love, us connecting. Don't you see... What I saw was that you hid a camera and filmed us having sex. And then showed it to everyone. But Dixon, it's not... You have no boundaries! I didn't think that I needed to haar boundies! I thought that we were in love! You know what, Silver? Just stay away from me. Just stay away from me. No! No! I'll destroy the movie. I will. Just don't be mad at me, okay? Please do not be mad at me. I, I am in love with you, Dixon... Are you out of your mind? Can I help you with that? Thank you. What do I get in return? For slobbering all over my beer? I'll go with nothing. Hey, I'm Milo. Naomi.Please excuse me. Wait, where you going, Naomi? Oh, man, what's your problem? I don't have a problem. You do. Let's go, Naomi. Something to help you find balance. It's a lens. You are an amazing photographer. And you need to stick with it. Thank you. You're welcome. Good lens? Yeah, I... I think it's a lens for a video camera, actually. But it's a beautiful lens. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Your soup is burning. No, it's not. But something is. What the hell? Oh, my God! What's going on, Dixon? The stars seem so far away. I know. Like little pinholes. Can I say something? Ms. Casey is a nazi. Shush. You, shush! Having fun with my girlfriend? So, I'm still your girlfriend, then? Because Rhonda seems to think that we're going through a rocky patch. You know what? I'm... Let you guys handle this. What were you doing with that guy? I was not kissing him. I'm sorry. But I didn't kiss Rhonda. She kissed me. I... I should have told you. Oh, why bother being honest when you could just spend your time giving me hell? I've been apologizing every day, Ethan! I've been apologizing to you in my sleep. I... I even gave up being in the stupid play because of you. You quit the play? Why? Because I was trying to convince myself that that was the problem. I wanted that to be the problem. Because if... if that's not it, then what is our problem? I don't know! Look, I don't want to keep fighting. Me, neither. Let's... end this. We're in... in two different places. It's... it's not your fault. It's because we've grown apart. And... I did feel something with Rhonda. Oh, my God. You're going to go out with Rhonda. This is not about Rhonda. I've had girlfriends since I was 12 years old. And I don't want a girlfriend right now. I need to figure out who I am... alone. I guess you were right. That, uh, that was not my scene. Hey, Kelly, uh, it's Ryan. Listen, I need you to call me back. Uh, Silver made a film and, uh... yeah, I don't really want to get into it on your machine. So just call me back. Silver. You didn't think I'd put it together, did you? What? What are you doing? No, just stop talking! Stop! It was a nice try, Matthews. You think that I'm dumb? Well, I am not dumb! It took me a little while, but I figured out what you were up to. You said to me that you liked movies better than blogs. You think you could possibly be referring to the blog that I posted about you? I wonder. You never got over it,did you? You pretended to... you pretended to forgive me. You even invited me back into your classroom. All so that you could encourage me to make this movie. This was all a set-up. Silver... No, stop! Drop the puppy dog face!I'm over it! I know that you don't want me to succeed. All you wanted was revenge. Listen to me. You know that's not true. You managed to turn Dixon against me. You've managed to ruin my relationship, the one think that I care the most about in this entire world Wait, wait, Dixon? Stay away from me! Do you wanna how I figured it out? Last night in the media lab you said to me, are you out of your mind? And then tonight, Dixon just now said to me, are you out of your mind? That is not a coincidence! You got to Dixon! You told him lies about me! All so that you could teach me a lesson. What kind of teacher are you? Silver, listen... Okay. What do you want from me? I... want... you...
