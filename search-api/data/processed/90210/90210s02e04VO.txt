So, you DJ? I do. You know, I'm... I'm in the music business. I didn't want to tell Naomi what happened between us, because she was done with me, but she's not. And she needs to know the truth. And when I deny it, who do you think she's gonna believe? What do you two want? Naomi, we need to tell you the truth about that night... we totally slept together. Back on me now. No! No! Naomi, She's lying to you. Might want to click that, 'cause we're going to Napa. Mmm. This is incredible. Mm. You are incredible. Uh... I want... Ooh... I want what's under there. Hey. I got a treat for you. Hey? Hey. You okay, sweetie? Yeah. Yeah, I just... I... I guess I fell asleep. Ooh! How could you when it's so positively thrilling around here? Oh, don't get me wrong. Love working weekends. Just wish it was a three-day weekend, you know,  I could give more to the Blaze. Yeah, thanks. It's the kind of sarcasm I need from my staff. Thanks. Oh, Chinese food! Chinese food! Keep ordering from Mr. Chow, and I will work any Sunday you want, boss. Perfect. Your boyfriend rocks, by the way. I know. I rock. He totally rocks. Oh, I love the bass on this part. Yeah, it's, like, boom, boom, boom. Right? Boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom, boom. Ooh! Oh! Oh. Sorry. Yeah. Oh. One second. Oh. It's Navid. Oh, again? Yeah. I got to tell you, that guy is dedicated to his job. Yeah, I think I better take this one. Oh, well, I will take a shower. Yes, because you are a dirty girl. Mm, filthy. What's up? A couples' massage? You got a $400 couples' massage? I just checked my credit card charges online. Navid, uh, you know, feel free to take the rest of the night off, you know, uh, you've worked hard enough this week. Yeah, I've been working hard. I'm sorry to be the bearer of a reality check, but have you lost your freaking mind? Sort of. Oh, man. All right, look. I'll pay you back for the couples' massage, all right? But I'm telling you, it was worth it. Navid, my friend, I am living the dream. Uh, Dixon, my friend you are living a lie. Look, I'm going to come clean. When? I don't know. Um, later. When the time is right. Okay, I don't know how you can handle this stress, okay? I can't. I've got sensitive skin, okay? And I'm, like, covered with hives. Navid, all right, look, man, I'm sorry I'm stressing you out, okay? I am very appreciative for everything that you've been doing... you know, loaning me your dad's car, renting out this hotel room for us. Covering for you with your parents. By the way, we've been working on a science project involving the tsetse fly. The what what? The tsetse fly. Remember that. It's important to have details down in case your dad asks on Monday. Oh, man, your dad. You better be in school tomorrow, or else, I... I don't know what I'll do. If... if he, like, interrogates me, if he interrogates me, I will so give you up. Navid! I don't do well under pressure. This is why I couldn't be a spy. I get all hivey and honest. Dixon?! Come join me in the shower! I got to go. Dixon? Hello? What are you doing here? I'm meeting someone. Who? Annie the skank? Teddy. We're going surfing. Look, none of what Annie said on the boat was true... none of it. We never had sex. Not a bunch of times, not once. Never. Naomi, you have to trust me. Trust you? That's a laugh. What do you know about trust, huh? Trust is what Naomi and I have. We look out for each other. We take care of each other. I can trust her, she can trust me. And we both can't trust you. Now shoo! Hasta luego. News alert! Four golf carts were stolen from the Westwood Country Club. Okay, it's a lame story. Um... Um, guys, I think I got a good one. You remember that homeless guy that was killed in the hit-and-run on prom night? Yeah. The one that Teddy Montgomery found on the side of the road? Yeah. Why? Oh, my God. What? Whoa. Gia! Sorry. Um... the homeless guy just donated $100,000 to West Bev. What? Why? How does a homeless guy have $100,000? Good questions. Go find out. Silver, you report it. Gia, produce the piece. Yeah! Sweet. Adrianna. What's up, Mom? Let's see. What are you doing? I'm just checking to make sure you haven't injured your hand. Your fingers aren't broken, are they? Uh... no. Then how come you haven't called your agent in two weeks, huh? Mom, I told you I am not auditioning. Whatever. Luckily, I called her myself... and she got you an audition for a mid-season pilot. Really? Yeah. Ugh. I'm not auditioning. Oh, God! Who do you think you are, Julia Roberts? What's that supposed to mean? Elise said that if you didn't show up to the audition, she's dropping you for good. Oh, no! No, no! What's wrong? Uh, we overslept. I'm... I'm late. We got to go. Please, get up. Good morning, Skank. Get a life, Naomi. Hey, do you, uh... You want to hang out later? Maybe. I'll let you know. Yo, Annie, I got a mouse pad made with the image from your sext. Closest you'll ever get to a girl. First of all, I want to say how sorry I am for your loss. Thanks. So, how did you find out about what had happened to him? What's going on? You know that homeless guy that was killed in the hit-and-run? His name is Joe Herman. Apparently, he went here, and he donated, like, $100,000 to West Bev in his will. What?! I know. Crazy, right? Check this out for crazy. His nephew goes here. That's him. His death must have been such a shock, huh? Yeah. Yeah, it was. Sync by honeybunny - corrected by chamallow35 www.addic7ed.com I don't mean to pry. I just think that the students of West Beverly would like to know about their mysterious benefactor. Oh, they do, huh? Lucky me. This must be what it's like to be popular. Can you tell us anything else about your uncle? He was nuts. Schizo. Um, he was... he was mentally ill? Whatever you want to call it. Wait a minute. You're that crazy chick. Uh, mentally ill chick. Seriously, I loved that movie you made last year. It was like a mix between early Cocteau meets, uh, Un Chien Andalou meets something wack. Uh, back to your uncle. Why do you think he left all his money to our school? Beats me. Are there any leads in this case? Please. To the cops, he was just another homeless guy left behind like a piece of garbage. The person who hit him and left him behind on the side of the road was the piece of garbage. Hey, Millicent, great goal against Fairfax. Sweeper never even saw it coming. Good job. Hey, Gavin, I told you, no skates at school! You said no rollerblading. No, I said no rolling wheels that attach to your feet. Hey, Navid? Ah, Principal Wilson! Hey! How you doing? Eh. Hey, how about that homeless guy? $100,000 for the school! That's a pretty amazing story. Uh, the Blaze is all over that, just so you know, so don't you worry. I'm gonna, uh, covert the heck out of it. Okay? Hey, so, where's Dixon? I haven't seen him in all morning. Everything okay? He's, uh... Well, the thing is, he's... Hey! What's up, Dad? Navid, where the heck have you been, man? I've been looking all over for you. We got to polish up that tsetse fly presentation, man. Yeah. That'd be great. Yeah. So, uh, we're gonna get going. See you later, Pops. Later. Yeah. I'm covered with hives, bro. Than, man. Thanks. Hey! Um, hey. Do you want to go grab some lunch or something? Uh... I... I, I can't. I have abs. Um, I mean, lab. I got... I got chemistry lab. So, um... yeah, I'm late. Bye. Bye. Ugh... Oh, my God! We've got to go to the "Ark de Triumph." L'Arc De Triomphe. You are so adorable. You are wonderful. Yeah, well. I can't believe you're taking me to Paris! I've never been out of the country. Yeah, you have. Dad took you to Canada. Yeah, well, well... Montreal's no Paris. Just saying, you said you'd never been out of the country, and you have. Hey, Liam. How about you don't use that tone with your mother? Okay? Hey. Would you look at this? We know her, don't we? Yeah. Yeah, we do. I can't believe people would rather read this than watch the Blaze. I mean, really? This is an insult to student intelligence. Yeah. Sasha and I both hate celebrity news. I mean, it's like we're both so in tune, kid. Ah... you guys are like Siamese twins, huh? Did I tell you guys that we both like DJ/rupture? Yeah, and Roy Campanella. And Orange Sherbert. And Casablanca. All right, all right! Geez. It's just that I've never found anybody who gets me like she does, you know? It like she knows me, man. Right, she knows you. Except for the little fact that you are a junior in high school. Little fact. Yeah, I'm going to tell her, guys. You could invite her to junior prom. Tell her there. Yeah. Shut up. Both of you, a right? I'm gonna tell her. I'm going to do it. Just when the time's right. Beautiful night, isn't it? What are you doing here? We need to talk. In private. Should I leave you alone or... You know what? It doesn't have to be in private. I don't mind discussing Olivier in front of your date. Darling, go inside. I'll be right in. Okay. Okay. What are you talking about? How did you...? Oh, finding the picture was luck. Then I got on the Internet. A lot comes up, it turns out. Partied pretty hard, huh? Chased after a lot of guys with money and titles. You don't know anything. And then, you landed Olivier. Rich, a baron. Perfect fairy tale for a gold digger. I mean, "happily ever after," right? Until your marriage ended after one month. According to the French tabloids, you are such a spendaholic that, when you guys split up, you were broke. You know what's funny? Naomi never told me you were married. Or broke. Or does she not know? Because... I thought your whole relationship was based on trust. What do you want? I want you to tell her what happened on prom night. Fine. Give me 24 hours. Fine. Man, agents are scum. Trying to blackmail you into auditioning. Yeah, but if I just go on this one audition, all I miss this afternoon is Humanities. Wait, I don't get it. I thought you didn't want to do the acting thing anymore. No, it's not that I don't want to, it's just... ugh... I just think it's probably a good idea to take a break. Huh. Agreed. But I don't want my agent to drop me. I mean, acting is my passion. I'm going to go back to it eventually. Oh, yeah, and then when you're ready, you'll get a new agent. Uh, I'm sorry, no offense. You, you don't know what you're talking about. That's not how things work. Why not? You're pretty amazing. Um... baby, I am a green-eyed brunette who can cry on command. Hmm. Do you know how many other girls there are just like me. Yeah. I do. Zero. Don't do it. Don't go. No, I'm serious. You know how that world makes you. All that Hollywood insanity, it just chews people up and spits them out. Look at you. Look what happened to you last year: all the drugs, the pregnancy... No, I know, I was there. I remember. You're doing it, you know? And you even reach that title of, uh, "No Drama Adrianna." Hey, you two. Hey. You guys ever take a class with Mr. Lichtenstein? The guy's like a freaking terrorist. Dude, you're taking him before lunch? Yeah. Once his blood sugar drops you're done-zo. Dude, unreal. You mind if I grab a few fries? Yeah. All right. Feel free. Um, I gotta go. Uh, make a call to my agent. Yeah? Yeah. Cool. But I will see you later? Okay. Bye, babe. Mm-hmm. By Hey. Hey. I... I just wanted to say that, um... I'm real sorry about your uncle. Okay. Thanks. I'm just so sorry. Why? Did you know him or something? Uh, no, um... No, it... it... it's sad and, and I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. That's all. Teddy! Vicky. So, hey, I'm working on a piece for the Blaze about Joe Herman, and I was really hoping to get a comment from you. I mean, after all,you were the one who discovered his body. Yeah, well, I was surprised. I mean, a hundred grand, that's pretty generous. I thought he was just homeless guy. I'm sorry... "Just a homeless guy"? Okay, that didn't come out right. I meant an... an "abode-challenged individual." Do you think being homeless is funny? Don't you? Look, they live in cardboard boxes, use grocery carts as means of locomotion... I'm kidding. I'm kidding! Why don't you go down to Venice Boulevard to do that set? I mean, maybe, you can start off with: "Hey, I'm Teddy. "My dad is a major movie star and I'll never have to work a day in my life." All right. All right. I get you. It was in bad taste. Whatever, um... Can you do the interview, please? About Joe Herman? I... You know what? I can't No, thanks. "No, thanks"? You got to leave me out of it okay? All right, look, maybe you saw something that you don't think is important... Look! I can't do it okay? Got . You can joke about the homeless, but you can't devote a single second of your precious time for one of them who was murdered. It's fabulous. Swinson. Tahmaseb. Tate-Duncan? Has anyone seen Adrianna? Navid, do you know where she is? Uh... I think she's at a doctor's appointment. Ok. Hey. Sweetie... Come sit down over here with me. There's something we need to talk about. I have to tell you something. Something that's gonna upset you. What is it, Jen? You're scaring me. The thing is, Naomi... I'm married. What? Well, it was a quite impulsive, really. We met last year and two months later we were married. His name Olivier. He's French. Why didn't you tell me? Because. Because right after we were married, I walked in on Olivier in bed with another woman. And I left him. Oh, my God. There's more. What more? Well, when I told you my money was "tied up" in Europe, that wasn't exactly true. The truth is that... I spent it all before met Olivier. And now I'm broke. I've been paying for everything: the rent, your clothes, your car your twice-weekly appointments at the Face Place. What were you planning to do, live off me forever, Jen? No, of course not. And I have every intention of paying you back. I just needed to get out of Europe and clear my head and figure out what to do. There's only one answer. I'm going back to Olivier. What? I can't live off you anymore. I... I just can't. It won't be so bad. Olivier wants me back and... I think I can live with an open marriage. "An open marriage"?! Jen! What are you out of your mind? No. I have too much pride anyway. Maybe it'll be good for me, in some sort of spiritual sense. And plus, when I'm back with Olivier, I... I will pay you back right away. You'll have your trust fund back. I'm not worried about my stupid trust fund. I'm worried about you. Look, look at me. You. Ok, you're not going back to some loveless marriage with some loser who will cheat on you like Dad did with Mom. No way in hell. Maybe if I just go back with Olivier. Over my dead body. Stop it! I don't want to hear another word about it. I didn't know Joe myself, but I've had a chance now to talk to some of his teachers and fellow students who knew him when he was here at West Bev, and this is what I've discovered. Joe loved earth science. He petitioned the school to buy an electron microscope. His sophomore year, he played varsity soccer for three years. Joe also participated in two school plays. He was Artie in The House of Blue Leaves, and he was the narrator in Our Town. Joe Herman was a West Bev student, like all  you Like was. He was one of us. Look, I'm getting you to Geoffrey's before sunset. I don't care how many tickets I get. You hungry? No, I'm starving, and excited about eating at Geoffrey's. Yeah, there's nothing like a little herb rusted salmon by the sea. Yeah. You know, I gotta tell you something, Dixon... I'm not really use to this whole fancy cars, fancy dinners things. Honestly, I have, like, $100,000 in student loans; I... I have a roommate and, most nights, when I'm not with you, I... I eat ramen noodles. Sasha... No, I know, I know, I know. I probably shouldn't be telling you this, 'cause L.A. is all about appearances, but... I don't know, it's... when I'm with you, it's, like, I feel like I can be real. You know? I feel like I can tell you anything. Hey, Sasha? Yeah? All right, what were you like when you were younger? When I was younger? Yeah, like, um, high school. Oh, man, that was a long time ago. Um, I guess like every other high school kid. Dumb as dirt. Thought I knew everything, really knew nothing. I mean, but, you know, there... there are some high school kids that are mature, right? Yeah, yeah, I'm sure they think they are. I mean, but, come on. How mature can they really be? They haven't done anything. I mean, come on. Think about how different you are since you graduated. Yeah, worlds away, right? Yeah, yeah, I... I guess you're right. Mm. And so, I said to Warren Beatty, "Back off man. I'm hitting on this girl." You did not say that. Yes, I did. Does anyone care for an hors d'oeuvre? Oh, yeah, sure. Awesome. These look great. These are wonderful. Awesome. Got it. Thanks, man. Enjoy yourself. Wow. I can't believe you talked to that guy. Don't you know he's just a waiter? All right, look, I was a jerk earlier. I told a few jokes that were... Well, they were in bad taste, and I'm sorry about it. Are we cool now? It depends. Will you do the interview? I can't. Right, because even though you're sorry, you're still a huge snob with a huge ego who thinks his time is too precious to spend, uh, five minutes talking about someone who's just a homeless guy. That's not the reason. Then why can't you do it? Because I'm not allowed to, okay? There's an ongoing investigation, and I'm a part of it. I really screwed up by talking to Navid before. I could've ruined the entire investigation. I can talk to the police, and that's it. But not to you. Because you know what? You're not a cop, you're not a detective. You're just a high school student. Awkward. So, you actually went to your audition? Well, yeah. I wanted to keep my options open. What, are you disappointed in me? No, I'm not going to deny it... I am disappointed. Don't you remember all the things that we went through last year? Okay, well, believe it or not, I didn't do blow in the bathroom. Ade this isn't a joke. Okay, it's not a joke to me, either. Just trying to keep things light. Okay, it was one audition... one... I just wish you would understand what this means to me, how acting makes me feel. Yeah, and I wish for once that you would understand how you make me feel, okay? This involves me, too, right? I mean, your actions have ramifications. I've been there through everything. Mm. Through the rehab, the pregnancy, the giving up your... Okay, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to make me feel guilty? No, Ade, I'm just trying to help you. Well, maybe I don't need your help. Oh, I gotta take this. Hello? Um, wow. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Bye. Um, that was my agent. I got the part. We, congratulations. Well, I'm glad you came, Annie. Yeah, it was really sweet of you. Mm. Oh, it's so sad. Huh? Poor man, just lost his way; fell through the cracks. Yeah. Um, if you guys don't need me for anything, I'm just gonna head home. I'm pretty exhausted. Yeah, honey, go ahead. Yeah, we'll be home soon. Okay, Navid, um, look, if I use my triple A, they'll ask to see my license, right? And there it'll be me, Dixon Wilson, 17 years old, driving your father's car. Change the tire. I don't know how to change a tire on that. It's like a freakin' spaceship. Look, Dixon, I don't have time to deal with this right now, okay? Believe it or not, I actually have my own life. Navid. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Nav... Hey, Dixon? Oh, baby, you don't gotta worry I know how to change a tire... What the hell is this? Oh... Why do you have a trunk full of porn? What kind of pervert are you? I'm... I'm... You have a trunk full of porn! What were you going to do, go home and watch a hundred movies? Sasha, no! Then why do you have it? You're clearly a pervert. I'm not... Who else has all this? People who... who are in the business. What? You're in the porn business? Um... Yeah. Oh! Yeah, yeah, I... I am. But not, not the perverted part, more the money part, which is why I have all of this. You said you were in the music business. Well, yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm... I'm trying to get into it. But the point is... how I make my money. I... I'm trying to get out of it because, obviously, I'm pretty ashamed to even be associated with the industry. Look, I was really, really embarrassed, but I shouldn't have lied. So I'm really sorry. I feel like I don't know even know you. What else have you lied about? Nothing. Nothing, nothing else. I swear. Everything else you know. You promise. No more lies? No more lies. Annie. Hey. I just wanted to say thanks for coming to my uncle's memorial thing. That was really cool of you. Yeah, re. What are you up to now? Oh, I'm just headed home. I've got a bunch of homework, so... Homework? The, uh, studious type? Look, blow it off. What? Blow off your homework. Come take a ride with me. I, I can't. I should go. That's all right. See you around? Okay. Bye. Uh, I guess I just... needed to talk to someone. That's all. What? About my uncle. It's finally, I think, hitting me. He died, that he's gone. I didn't know him the past couple years, but when I was a kid... we, uh, used to hang out all the time. I remember he used to take me to the movies when I was, like, two, on Sundays. Sometimes we'd see three, four, in a row. He must've liked something about the peace, you know, of a dark theater, but for me, it was just... I lived for those days. I don't know, I guess today just brought stuff up. But get on home. Do your homework. I'll be fine. I'll see you. Jasper, wait. Um... I'll go for a ride with you. You will? Cool. Come on. Hey, have you seen Teddy? I have to apologize to him. I haven't seen him. Everything okay, Navid? Yeah, everything's fine. Just fantastic. Did you tell Naomi the truth? Yes, did, actually. I told her that I'm married and that I'm broke. I really want to thank you, Liam, for forcing my hand. I feel so much better now that Naomi knows everything. In fact, I feel free as a bird. But, I mean... Oh, easy does . Let me know if you're going to have a fit so I can look for a broomstick to put in your mouth. Now, why don't you run along and look for some other girl to obsess over? Naomi will never believe that we slept together. Hey. Hey, you, you all right? All right is relative, right? What's wrong? Okay. So I went on that audition I was telling you about. Yeah. I got the part. Ade, that's, that's great. Is it? What's the problem? I don't ow what I... I don't know what I should do, you know, 'cause I, I love acting. I love it. I know. But maybe it is bad for me. You know, I don't know if I'm ready for that drama. What if I screw everything up again? I'm scared. Come here. Um.. We shouldn't have done that. Um... I... I got to go. You know, those stars up there, they might not even exist. I mean, it takes so long for the light to travel here that the stars themselves, they could be gone now. You know? It's just, it's just weird but they're like a message from back in time. Yeah. I... I'm not sure I even know what that means. Just that, that... the universe is bigger than we can imagine, you know? I guess it just kind of puts things in perspective. All the stuff that we think is so important, you know, in reality.. it's not. It's nothing. Man, I wish that was true. It is. Our planet, never mind our species, you and me... we're nothin. We're like a blip in time. You know, that's what my uncle was. You know, he was alive and now he's dead, but... Maybe it's not that big of a deal, you know, in the scheme of the universe. Do you really think that's true? What will be will be, you know? We're just pawns in the universe's game. We can't worry. We just have to lie back and enjoy the ride. Yeah. 174 Walden. It's a nice house. Yeah. Pretty traditional. I mean, not what you'd expect from a porn king. He's not a "porn king." And I told you, he's getting out of it. He just, he needed to make some money to pay off some debt. But porn? I mean, that doesn't bother you at all? I swear, if it were any other guy then, yeah, it probably would be a deal-breaker. But Dixon is special. He's sweet and understanding and, oh, we have so much in common. Oh, yes, the orange sherbert and Roy Campanella and you even have the same cell phone, which is why you mixed them up. How adorable. I thought Dixon drove a Lamborghini. Well, he probably just has a few different cars. Who...? Uh... Who is that white woman and why is she hugging your boyfriend? Um, thanks for coming over. Yeah. I wanted to tell you this in person. Tell me what? Um... I turned down the part. And my agent's dropping me, but it's fine. You know, I'm totally, I'm totally taking the year off. We have been through so much. I just, I don't want any more temptations right now. I love you so much, Ade. I am so in love with you. Um... So, my mom is working late tonight. We have the whole place to ourselves. I think we've waited long enough, don't you think? For...? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh-huh. Champagne for no reason. Now, this is the kind of life I always thought I'd live. Mm, who says that there's no reason? It's a Tuesday. Oh, yes. Uh, Champagne Tuesday at the Clark residence. So, how was your day? Ugh, hideous. High school kids are so annoying. Naomi driving you up a wall? Something like that, yeah.
