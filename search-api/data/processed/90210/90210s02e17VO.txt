I joined the band to get over Navid, now I have to spend every day with the girl he's dating? - I'm kicking you off the Blaze. - What do you want? Name it. I'll do anything. Please. I'll do anything. - Are you offering to sleep with me? - What? No. I... Because that would be completely inappropriate. You're off the Blaze. I know this isn't what you want to hear, but you were the one out of line. I cannot believe you're taking his side, Silver. He said if I wanted back on the Blaze, I had to sleep with him. What?! So, you want to go out on a date? - Do you mind if I crash here tonight? - Not at all. Tonight, tomorrow, - as long as you want. - I'm Laurel. If I can't be with you, - there's no point in living. - Jasper, no. I told you, I don't know where he is. I just hope he's not getting into too much trouble before his parents come back to town. Leave a message. I need you to tell me where you are, okay? I'm just getting really worried. Please call me back. And please don't hurt yourself. What are you doing up there? - It's all pointless, Annie. - What is? All of it. Life. It's a joke. It's painful. It's humiliating. And I'm over it. You still have not chosen a loofah. - I think you should come forward. - Liam, no. What Mr. Cannon said to you was sexual harassment. I don't want to deal with the aggravation. Now, I'm assuming you're going to go with blue, but lavender could be bold statement for guy. I don't understand. Why don't you report him? This has been a really crazy year. The feud with Annie, the situation with Jen. Jen has hurt you enough. Don't let her stop you from doing what's right. What? The truth is... I'm a lot more like Jen than you probably think. You are nothing like Jen. And if you were, I wouldn't be with you. I'll take an Arnold Palmer, mostly iced tea. Like, a quarter lemonade. And just a regular water for me. Thanks. So, you notice anything different about me? You're taller? Shorter? Wait. I know. You shaved your mustache. No. I got a haircut. Really? Like, a hair cut? Single hair? You're just not very detail-oriented, are you? Just because I didn't notice your emperor's new haircut... Now, come here, you totally transformed woman. Hey! Dixon. Hey, man. How's it going? Who you here with? No one. By myself. You know what? I should set you up with my mixed doubles partner. No. Don't worry about it, man. I'm serious. She is totally hot. Definitely not my type. Thanks for looking out for me, but I'm cool doing my own thing. See y'all later. Jasper, please listen to me. It's not pointless. What's the point? What's the point to life? You don't love me anymore. Do you? Peach Pit team Season 02 Episode 17 Sweaty Palms and Weak Knees Hi. We're looking for Jasper Herman. He's our son. I'll see if he's out of surgery. Mr. And Mrs. Herman? What's going on? Do you know? All we've been told is that he fell off the top of the Hollywood sign. Were you with him? What was he even doing up there? Was he filming something? No, I... Look, he didn't fall. He jumped. Oh, my God. Listen, you should go home, Annie. Get some sleep, and... we'll call you if we hear any news. - I can stay. - No. Jasper's our son. We'll handle this. You should take care of yourself. Okay. I am sick. - Cold or flu? - Not that kind of sick. I just... Why am I enjoying watching you iron so much? - I'm sick, that's all. - You're a sexist pig. - What do you think? - Cute. You're driving us to the concert, right? You know it. - You're the best roadie ever. - Roadie? I was thinking more groupie. That's possible. It's very possible. But you know what groupies do for their rock stars? What? Their ironing. Okay. Wilson looks. He shoots. - Come on. - Was it something I said? - Do over. - No way, man. I want my ten bucks. Are you guys betting on baby basketball? That's just sad. I wish I could put money on the Lakers. Telling you they're about to go on a roll I can feel it. Sounds like someone's got the gambling bug. Bug? No. Gift? Yes. Could you hook me up with your dad's bookie? - Yeah, sure. - Cool. I'm telling you, I really feel good about the Lakers. Put me down for 250 bucks. You don't want to put it on the Lakers. My dad's got floor seats and last night, he overheard his trainer saying that Kobe's going to sit out against the Spurs. - His knee's bothering him. - Really? Then, I'm feeling really good about the Spurs. - Hook me up, all right? - You got it. Anyone see the Cavs last night? LeBron was on fire. Man, I missed it. Naomi and I were... Never mind. Liam, what's your problem? You can talk about Naomi in front of me. Dixon looks. He shoots. - Are you okay? - Never been better. Why? I don't know. It just looks like you have something against those books. I don't get why everyone keeps treating me like I'm some loser or something. - You're preaching to the choir, miss. - Really? Ever since Silver and Teddy's been going out, they've been treating me like some... charity case. Seriously? Yeah. Teddy tried to hook me up with some tennis girl. He was like, "Let me call in a favor to this ex-girlfriend of mine to see if she'll go out with you. " Like I need his hand-me-downs. I hear you. I mean, between you and me, Liam's practically chewing my food for me then regurgitating it back into my mouth. What? He's patronizing me, he treats me like I'm some baby or something. Baby bird, yeah. I get it. And you know what I mean, though? It's kind of ridiculous. I... As if I care that he's still dating that giggling imbecile? Like I'm supposed to care that Silver changed her Facebook status to "in a relationship. " Why do you know Silver's Facebook status? Anyways, you want to hang out later? I don't know, grab a burger? Yes, that'll be cool. I mean, it seems like everybody else is coupled off. And besides, I haven't had a Beach Burger since... yesterday. - Peace. - I'll call you. I'm just saying... you can't let Mr. Cannon get away with it. That's exactly what I've been saying. Have you guys seen Alaina Grossberg's collagen injections? - You have to tell somebody. - Honestly, it's not that big of a deal. Seriously, her lips look like an inner tube. It is, and it's your responsibility. Your moral obligation. Think about it. What if Mr. Cannon harasses some other girl? Enough! Please! Just stop! This has been really hard? Yeah, it has. This whole situation is... it's too much. Maybe you should talk to somebody. Maybe Kelly. It's a good idea. You're struggling with this. Fine, I'll talk to someone. Not Kelly. I don't trust this psyche to anyone who costs less than $400 an hour. - I'll see a real therapist, okay? - Come here. - Your chair, madam. - Thank you. Are those new shoes? I like 'em. Thank you. So did I when I bought them in seventh grade. Nice try. What did we miss? Nothing. Teddy's just trying to prove how well he knows me. - He's crashing and burning. - I am so not crashing and burning. Hello, there. What can I get you all to drink? Maybe some water for the table. Sure. Sparkling or flat? What do you prefer? How about... Teddy, you want to tell him what I like? Sparkling, because she has such a sparkling personality. Actually, I like flat, because apparently I have a flat personality. I'll get a bottle of each. I was close. It's not like you know everything about me. You know what? He's gonna have an Arnold Palmer... three-quarters iced tea, one-quarter lemonade. Snap. I guess so. Great. Let's go, right? - What's up? - Come here. - Grab a fork, stab me in the jugular. - Too late. You guys wanna join us for dinner? - Why not? - Yeah, there's plenty of room. I can just sit in Liam's lap. - Actually, we were... - We're on a date. All right! You can do better. Naomi, I can hear you. Anyway, that's really great. It's pretty great. Anyway... we should go. - Shall we? - We shall. Bye. - Have fun. - See ya. What the hell was that? That was crazy! Yeah, kinda. But kinda crazy awesome. Really? Hell, yeah! Did you see their faces?! So... guess you're my boyfriend now. Guess so. - After you, my lady. - None of that gentlemanly crap. Come on. A lingerie Web site. Montgomery, has it really come to this? I'm trying to find a gift for Silver. Good luck with that. One time I bought her a leather bracelet and she accused me of being insensitive to cow feelings. Cow feelings. She's not exactly the easiest to shop for. Tell me about it. Do you think maybe she'd like to... You know what? Never mind. It's cool, man. All right, I moved on. I really like Ivy now. Hell, yeah. In fact, I recently bought Ivy a little gift myself. What'd you get her? I can't have you rip off my idea. It's way too good. You and Ivy. - I did not see that coming. - Yeah, I know. Neither did I. See you later, man. Later. Hello? Hi, Annie. Matey Herman. I just wanted to let you know that Jasper is going to make it. Good. He's okay? He broke both his legs and sprained his shoulder, but, yes, physically he's going to be fine. Psychologically, mentally, the kid's obviously going through a rough patch. Once he checks out over here, he's going to be checking into a psychiatric facility for a little while. A psychiatric hospital? I mean, that's... that makes sense. - That's good. - Yeah. We feel it's going to help. And help get him talking, you know? My brother's death really affected Jasper, and we just want him to talk to someone. Open up. Stop hiding. One more thing. Jasper wanted to talk to you before he goes away. Would you... would you do that for him? - You really didn't have to drive me. - I wanted to. - How long is your therapy session? - I'll be done in about an hour. I'll pick you up then. Thank you. - Good luck. - Thank you. May I please get a nonfat blended mocha for here? And can I see a menu, too? Great! Now, we're going to be late to our own show. When did they start locking the school so early? Maybe after somebody spray painted "Beth Jennings is a whore" - all over the courtyard. - Why would anyone do that? Cause she's whore-like. Whorish, whore-esque. Not that I did it. I told you it was a stupid idea to leave our instruments at school. I told you guys we can't practice in my parents' garage anymore. They can't handle the noise. - Your parents have no taste in music! - What the...? Why don't we just climb up the fire escape - and jump down into the courtyard? - Can we do that? Yeah, totally. All right, let's do it. - You are a genius. - Just your number one groupie. - Come here. - Come on, guys! Let's go. Whatever. Are you still mad? I'm not mad. I didn't realize we're still keeping secret. I didn't either. I guess I'm not ready to let people know yet. - Awesome. - Gia, I'm sorry. I'm still trying to figure this thing out. Step one, stop calling it "this thing. " you guys? So, how were we supposed to get over the wall with our instruments? I hadn't really thought that far ahead. Wait! Before we go in. I got a little something for you. What's this for? Teddy was getting something for Silver, so I just thought... Right... of course. You know... for a second there, I thought you might really like me. What? - Look, I'm sorry... - Shut up, douche bag. I'm kidding. Give me the necklace. Is this scrimshaw? This is rad, Dixon. If we were dating, I would be all over you. And that's exactly what I want to hear. Now, look, I'm not telling you you have to wear it in there and make a big fuss about what a great boyfriend I am... Prepare to be fussed over. What's the word? The word is that I got a great guy. - Stop it. Come on. - No, I can't, it's true. Look what my little Poopy got me. - I'm sorry, "Poopy"? - That's what she calls me. - Cause she's my little Stinky Pants. - I don't even want to know. Anyway... Where's the band, guys? Aren't they supposed to go on soon? You know bands... notoriously late. Someone's probably throwing a fit or eating a bat or something. - Anyway, should we get drinks? - You got it... Poopy. Yeah, that's me. Can we do that in public? - Thanks. - Thank you. So... I got you a little gift, too. To prove how well I know you. - You did not have to do that. - I know I didn't have to. I wanted to. Because I wanted to see your face... when you opened it up. What do you think? Do you love them? - Are they my girl's best friend? - Yes, they... are gorgeous and big. Thank you. - Let's see how they look. - Yeah, okay. Beautiful. Perfect. Guys, there's, like, a zillion people out here. We're gonna rock this bitch! - You okay? - Ade, what's wrong? I can't do this. What are you talking about? I have never sung in front of a crowd like this. And I can't even take a drink to calm down. Don't worry. You're going to be amazing. I'm sorry. I just... I can't do this. What do you mean you can't? I just can't. All right, girl... We are going to be right behind you. You've just got to face your fears. Don't think about who's watching... - Come on. - I'm sorry. Sing in my place. - Please? - No way. No. We're a band. All right? It's all for one... and all that crap. She's right. We do it together, or we don't do it at all. Guys, come on. Not a chance. There'll be plenty of other gigs. The important thing is that we stick together. Put away the puppy dog eyes. We're not gonna rock this bitch without you. Hi! We're The Glorious Steinems! - Can I have a shot of tequila? - Sure. Mom. What are you doing here? Guitarist's dad's an old friend. Don't worry. No one's going to know I'm your mom. Cause if you call me "Mom" in public, I'll sock you. How about "Mommy"? - Swift kick to the groin. - Gotcha. - So, who are you here with? - Just some friends from school. - Not that jerk Liam? - Mom, he's not a jerk. He just has god-awful taste in women. - Don't worry, you'll get over him. - I know. I... Whatever. Which one is he, anyway? Looks like a square to me. What's with that helmet hair? - Thanks, Mom. - Shh, not so loud. I just wanted to make sure you're okay. Don't lie to me. What are you talking about? You're here 'cause... you have to make sure I won't tell anyone your secret. That's not true. Okay? Despite everything, I actually care about what - happens to you. - But you don't love me. I don't. You should've just left me there to die. Stop. Okay, just stop manipulating me. - I'm not. - Yeah, you are. You have been from the start. Even the way we got together. You were just preying on the fact that I felt so guilty about your uncle. - You should feel guilty. - Don't worry. I do. Every day, I do. But I don't owe you a relationship because of it. So then what incentive is there to keep me from telling? None. Everything I did, I have done it because I love you. You have to know that. I know that you think that. But what we had was all based on lies. - It wasn't love. - Yes, it was. It was. It was. And that's why I'm not going to tell anyone. I'm never going to tell your secret, ever. I'm sorry, but... visiting hours ended a while ago. Thank you. I really hope you get better. Good-bye. I thought we were still trying to figure this thing out. I just had to face my fears and not worry about who's watching. And don't call it "this thing." That was an awesome show? You okay? I need to talk to you about something. It's something I feel really bad about, but you need to know. Or maybe you don't need to know, but I need you to know. What is it? I hate these earrings. I'm sorry. I know that they were a gift and it's all about the thought and... It's kind of the thought that bothers me. These are just so not me. I know most girls love diamonds, but I look at them and I think about about slave mining, orphans in Sierra Leone and these mistresses in Texas with their hair- sprayed hair... Why are you laughing? Here's your real present. I remember at the beginning of the year when we read this in Matthews' class, you went on and on about how much you liked it, and how amazing it was that Flaubert could write from a woman's perspective, and how much that inspired you. And I thought to myself, "stay away from that girl. She's way too much. " That's what you thought? So, this whole time, you were... what, you were just screwing with me? See, I do pay attention to detail, and I do know you. I definitely knew those earrings would make you mad. They're fake... by the way. But I also know how cute you look when you're angry. I hate you. No, you don't. Trust me. I know you. So, your mom seems cool. - When did you...? - I think it's absolutely wonderful that you can be so open with her about your love life. Excuse me? I heard you, loser. I know you're still into Liam. What are you talking about? I'm with Dixon now. I saw how quickly you let go of each other's hands - when you thought no one was looking. - Cause our palms were sweaty. - You're obviously not really dating. - Yeah, we are. - In fact, we're... - Totally pathetic. You have no idea what you're talking about. Sorry. Naomi didn't believe that we were actually dating. We can't have that now, can we? That was great. She totally bought that. Water? Thank you. So, you feel like your therapy session helped? - Yeah, definitely. - Good. And do you feel better about coming forward with what happened? When I was at therapy, I really thought through what will happen if I do come forward. Everyone at school will talk about me, judge me, maybe even blame me for what happened. I wish I were stronger, Liam, I really wish I were. The truth is, I'm not. And I'm not ready. And I don't know when or if I ever will be. - It's okay. - No, it's not okay. I should be stronger. I should be... It's all right. I hate that guy for putting you in this position. I hate him. Mr. Cannon, I forgot my paper. Can I run home and get it? - I don't know. - Please? You know you're, like, my favorite teacher, right? Okay, go get your paper, but don't be gone too long. - You son of a bitch. - Get your hands off me! You're a piece of garbage. What's your name?! Okay, this is cool. Thank you. See ya. Thanks for letting me borrow your car. Yeah, no worries. Just return it with a full tank of gas, - and no dents. - Yeah. That's Adrianna, right? Sweet. What are you doing? You can't exactly just park the car here. You park it, then. I'm Ivy's mom. I saw your show last night. You were fantastic. Thank you. You're a music producer? Until the powers that be tell me otherwise. I work with a lot of talented musicians your age. And I'm interested in signing you. No, I mean, yes. I mean, really? Oh, my God. I can't wait to tell the band. I wouldn't rub it in their faces. Because I'm not interested in signing the band. I'm only interested in you. Okay, just get it out of your system now. Do you prefer the more colloquial "Poops," or perhaps the more formal "Señor Poopy"? Very funny. - Do you want your money or not? - What money? You didn't hear about the Lakers? Kobe sat out, and they still beat the spread. I owe you $250. - It pains me to take this. - It pains me even more. But it's my own fault. I should have trusted my instincts. Anyway there's a game this weekend, and... I want to put the rest of this on L.A. Man, are you sure? Positive. I got to build back up. See you later, man. Later. It's an awful day to be stuck in school. How about we grab our wetsuits and head up to Zuma? It's tempting, but I can't. I have a history test. Square. Okay, I'm going to go take a history test, which will be a lot more pleasant than this encounter. What's up, Stinky Pants? What up, Poopy? You know, just in case Naomi walks by. Gotcha. - I like the way you think. - Thank you. Did you hear about Liam? He's in the principal's office. - What? Why? - Apparently, he attacked Mr. Cannon. Oh, my God! So, Liam, what happened? Why would you go after Mr. Cannon? I don't even know this kid. If you don't say something, I'm going to have no choice but to expel you. Why don't you head back to your class, Miles? Thanks. - Is Liam in there? - You know that kid? - He's my boyfriend. - Say good-bye to him for me. He's about to be expelled. What happened? - Please, you can't do this. - This doesn't concern you. Yes, it does. I didn't tell him what this is about. You don't have to say anything. Yes, I do. Principal Wilson, this is all my fault. The only reason Liam did this is because...
