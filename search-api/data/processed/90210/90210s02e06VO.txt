- Come take a ride with me. - I'll go for a ride with you. - I'm married. - Why didn't you tell me? There's more. When I told you my money was tied up in Europe, that wasn't exactly true. The truth is that I'm broke. What were you planning to do? Live off me forever, Jen? - You shouldn't have done that. - This guy... no longer a virgin. She just came back from Beach Club, and she could not keep her hands off me. What do you care who I make out with? - You've got a boyfriend. - Kiss whoever you want. I wanted to be here so that I could tell my mother to stay away from me. Your mom called me. She told me... She has cancer, Silver. Did you remember the Cilantro? Please say yes, cause I'm dying to try this new recipe and it's not going to taste - like anything without... - I didn't. I'm sorry. What? I should tell you something, but I think... I don't know if I should tell you or if I should tell her to tell you or... What are you talking about? Come on. Sit down. Tell me. It's about Mom. What about her? She has... She has cancer. - She's dying. - What? I ran into her at an AA meeting when I went with Ade, and she wanted to talk to me, to make up with me. I told her to leave me alone. Actually, I told her to "drop dead." I didn't know what was going on. She told Ade, and Ade told me. And I was dying to tell you, but I thought maybe she would tell you. I'm sure she wouldn't. I made it clear that I never wanted to talk to her again. Me, too. But... now everything's different, right? We should call her. What should we do? Nothing. We... do nothing. Nothing's different. I'm sorry that she's sick. I am. But... we can't get sucked back into that woman's drama. - It's not drama... - Yes, it is. With Mom, it always is. Listen to me. I want you to think about everything that she's done, all the ways that she has hurt you. Just because someone's sick... doesn't change the past. Promise me that you won't get sucked back in? I promise. Who cares how much money these blockbusters make? They're insidious. They're killing cinema. Kubrick. Tarkovsky. Bunuel. Where are these masters today? Where are they? Bunuel, Bunuel... he directed Alvin and the Chipmunks, right? I'm sorry. I know I take this all too seriously. Are you kidding? You're passionate. It's awesome. It's great. It makes me a pretty popular character around here, too. Who cares what these idiots think? I'm impressed. You're just nice. I think you're nice. I think you're very nice. How would you feel about taking a "very nice" girl along with you the next time you went to the cinema. I'd feel good about it. There's something playing at the Egyptian in a couple of days. Sounds good. Isn't that your booty call with Mr. Columbine? Homeboy got dumped for that guy? That's pitiful. - It's also kind of funny. - Shut up, you douche. Am I supposed to keep tabs on every stupid hook up? It's cool. No shame in sharing your candy with Jasper. I enjoyed our evening the other night. The moonlit ride, dinner in the orchard. My chef is famous for his white truffle omelets, but he only serves them at breakfast. If I'm ever up early and in the neighborhood, I'll drop by. Still the stubborn, bucking filly? Just not that kind of girl. Continental Accent. Impeccable bloodlines. Five generations of champions. He's for sale. He's magnificent. And he could be worth a fortune. With his earnings potential at the race track? And his years of stud work after? There is no limit how much he could make. Look who's here, again. Have a wonderful ride, ladies. Are you enjoying your Juan Peron? Let's just say, I'm enjoying access to the finest riding estate within 50 miles. I have some good news. - I've started my divorce proceedings. - That's great. It's all thanks to your advice. We just need to send in a deposit to retain the lawyer. It's a little over a hundred thousand. - Ideally, by Thursday. - Isn't that kind of a lot? I've seen divorces advertised on TV for $200. I don't want a TV lawyer. The prenup is pretty solid. I'm sorry, you signed a prenup? Which is why I need an excellent lawyer. If he can show that Olivier violated the marital contract by celebrating adultery, the French national pastime, then he can prove I'm entitled to a share of his assets. But if he can't, I'm just out a hundred thousand dollars. - I'm footing the bill here. Not you. - How many times you'll throwing that? Someone needs to be responsible about money, Jen. You know what? I don't need financial counsel from a trust-fund brat. You're one to talk. You haven't worked a day. We're a little different. I went to Yale. You didn't graduate. You threw yourself at some rich guy's feet like it was 1957. Now you're offering me romantic advice? That's a laugh. You couldn't even keep your little high school James Dean happy. The shrimp looks good. The wild Alaskan salmon is in. I'm thinking shrimp, then I always get shrimp. Does that make me boring and predictable? No, silly. Get what you want. Look, Ade... I feel like things have been a little off between us. But it's okay. Going back to school and putting the acting on the side... that's been a big shift for you. I totally get that. It's like the tectonic plates have shifted. But you and me, we're earthquake proof. Am I blabe*** too much? No, I'm listening. And I'm reading this amazing book by Frank Lloyd Wright, and I'm totally obsessed with architecture. We have to go to the B.A. Center, check out the Hollyhock and Ennis Houses - when the renovations are complete. - Stop! - I can't do this. - What? This. Us. I can't do it anymore. What are you talking about? I can't be your girlfriend. These last few months have been a blur, and maybe you're right. Maybe it's just been all too much. Not acting, losing my agent. I am so overwhelmed. I need to figure out who I am before I'm just become Navid's girlfriend. I need some time alone. We need to break up. Oh, my God. I am so sorry. Peach Pit team Pour Forom.com Saison 02 Episode 06 Umasked I was like, "I might get shrimp," and then she's like, "Wild Alaskan salmon, that's in." And then I said, "Maybe I shouldn't get the shrimp. Maybe that's boring." And then she said, "No, silly." She always called me "silly." What's up, guys? I'm sorry I'm late. - Wilshire was a parking lot. - Cut up to Beverly. Would you shut up about the traffic? I'm dying here. I'm sorry, bro. Nice place you got here, man. Thanks. What's under this tarp? Nothing. Just don't... Don't touch that. Are you guys hungry? I got sandwich stuff in the house. My mom made some kind of cake if you want dessert. Screw dessert. Why don't we grab a couple of six packs, head down to the beach, take your mind off it? I don't want to. I want to figure it out 'cause it doesn't make any sense. I was at the restaurant and I sat down and I was like, "I might get the shrimp" and then she was like "Yeah, "wild Alaskan salmon, that's in." And then I said "Maybe shrimp's boring." Just broke up with Navid... Guess now I'm free</i> [...] Guess now I'm alone Envoyer So when R we hanging out? Please tell me how you deal with those brats all day long. It's not easy. Especially now that caning is politically incorrect. Naomi troubles? Can you disown a sibling? She drives you nuts, but it's just because you guys are so close. You know you're all she's got. She's lucky to have you. Are you going to be a gentleman and help me off with these? I was considering it but then I thought, "What if I helped her off with everything but the boots?" And I gotta say, it wasn't the worst image. You don't hear me complaining. And with her signature, impeccable timing. - There's Naomi. - Who has changed her name to "Eduardo." This is our time together. Besides, Eduardo's gotta learn that I'm not always available to him. What? - You're upset. - No. I love being in the loop and hearing your strategies for juggling guys. - It's a real aphrodisiac. - Please. You can't possibly be jealous. Obviously, we're dating other people. Sure. Where were we? What's up? Nothing much. I was thinking, we haven't really hung out that much since Teddy's party. And yet the world is still spinning around somehow. I never meant to hurt you with that sext. I showed it to a couple of friends, and that was lame and I'm really sorry. - Really sorry. - Thanks. The real jerk in this whole thing is Naomi. She's the one that sent it. She's a bitch. Can't argue that. So, do you think maybe, I don't know, we could hang out sometime? Are you seeing somebody? Maybe. Whatever. As long as it's not that Jasper dude. And what's wrong with Jasper? You don't know? The guy's a psycho. He pulled a knife on a guy last spring. I'm sure that's just gossip. No, it's not. Jasper is a seriously messed up guy. I'd be careful if I were you. There you are! When are we gonna have our lunch? Harry, hi. How are things? Good. Are we playing hide-and-go-seek? Because I found you, you're it, and I feel like you've been avoiding me. No, I've just been really busy with midterms and, college counseling. What about tomorrow for lunch? - That's no good for me. - Next day? Let me check. I will look. But I have to go to a thing, so... I'll shoot you an email. - I'm here to see my mother. - You must be Silver. My name's Mindy. I'm one of your mom's nurses. Come in. I'm glad you're here. Your mother's going to need support from her family during this time. - We have a visitor! - Who is it? I just knew you'd come. - Three months? - That's just a guess. No one really knows these things. But I wouldn't buy any theatre tickets for much after that. There's no Stage V. You haven't touched your tea. I don't really drink tea. Just coffee. Get out. Really? Since when? I don't know, four years? - I can get you some coffee. - Don't worry about the coffee. When did they find the cancer? Last year. I did everything they told me. Stopped drinking. Tried my damndest, anyway. Had the lump removed, did the chemo and all that. For what? But I guess they didn't get it all, and by now it's spread everywhere. All I know is that the "tick, tick, tick" just gets louder each day. When I laid into you at your meeting, I didn't know that you were so sick. You had every right to say those things. I was such a lousy mother. If I could go back and change the past, I would. But all I can do now is focus on the present. It's all I have. That's good. I's not too late. Maybe we can even hang out a little. I'd like that. Do you think... Would you... What? Will you move back home? It'd mean the world to me. Can I join you for lunch? And before you answer, you should know that I haven't asked one person that in the past two miserable years here. I've actually got this chem quiz to study for. That's okay. I eat super quietly, it's almost freakish. You know,, I'd rather eat alone. - Are you okay? - I'm just busy. - What about the Egyptian later? - I totally forgot. I signed up for peer tutoring, and it starts today, so I gotta cancel. - Okay, well, maybe... - Some other time. What? I was counting on you, man. I gotta get out there and meet somebody, and now my wingman's bailing on me at the last second? That's, that's cold, brother. I'm just saying, first rule of the wingman's handbook: Don't bail on your pilot. Yeah, all right, later. Sounds like somebody needs a wingman. We were just, making a vague future sort of plan. I was a primo wingman back in the day. And I wouldn't mind getting out of the house. Blowing off a little steam. Knocking back a few frosties. Frosties? Brewskies, my friend. Bitter batters? Barley pops, brain hammers, the real man's Zima... - I could go on. - No, I think I got it. Now, the first round is on <i>moi.</i> I got your text. Thanks for coming. I know it was short notice and all. Okay, here's the thing. I've been feeling sick about our fight the other day. Oh, thank God. Me, too. When we're not getting along, I can't function. I couldn't focus at all in class today. You're not just my baby sister. You're my best friend. And stupid things like money should never get in the way of that. - Totally. - Which is why I've decided to move out. What? That's crazy. Don't be... Just while I figure out this divorce thing. - What are you gonna do for money? - Oh, I'll make do. Besides, you'll be better off. You don't need me around, spending all your money and dragging you down. Let's see here, should we order an appetizer? I want to enjoy this place while I'm still a member. I was wondering, since she wasn't in class, if I could give you a Humanities handout for Silver. It's just a short story and a couple of essay questions. She wasn't in class? I think Adrianna said something about Silver taking your mother to a doctor's appointment. I will make sure she gets it. Thanks. I guess Silver told you. Pretty crazy, right? How you feeling? Much better now that you're here. I'm sorry I didn't call you. I just thought, with all the terrible things I did Please, don't. - I need to say this. - No, you don't, okay? What happened between us, it happened. We can't change it. I know. The only reason I came here was to tell you to leave Silver alone. What? She's bipolar, Mom. She's doing really well right now. We're doing really well. I know. I want to be a part of it. Try to be a mother - while I still can. - Fine. Be one. Mothers want what's best for their children. What's best for Silver is that you leave her alone. Sorry, I don't sign autographs until game day. I just wanted to thank you for warning me about Jasper. No worries. I do owe you, right? Look, I meant what I said. I'm really sorry. So, what, so, you're not gonna go out with him? So, you're single, you're alone? It's not like I'm some kind of a leper or anything, but, no, I'm not dating anybody. - Are you doing anything tonight? - Not really. Me, neither. Do you want to maybe hang out together? - What the hell, right? - Yeah, what the hell. So, just put your account number and your new billing address at the top right hand corner, and we'll have this... Jen, stop. - I can't. - Yes, you can. I am not letting money drive a wedge between me and my best friend. Thank you. Now, go take that cheating-frog ex-husband for all he's worth, okay? Perfect score from the judges. Thank you. There's only one judge I care about. Extra-perfect scores from her. - I'm having the best day with you. - Me, too. Kissing you and not feel like we're doing something wrong. I know, I know. You shouldn't be standing outside. Let's go in. I'm sorry, Silver. I had no right to ask you to move in. I have no right to ask anything of you. Kelly's right. I... I should leave you alone. When she first showed up, I was hurt, but she's right. I'm sorry. I will stay away. I have a cute girl for you. You know that Starbucks on Olympic near the school? There's a barista there, works in the morning, redhead wears her hair up? She sing your drink orders in an opera voice? Two nonfat, extra-foam double caps. - I know who you mean. - And? I want to murder that woman in the span of time - it takes her to place my drink order. - Somebody's a diva. I have got to drain the lizard. Let's keep spitballing. Another round, please. So, who's your friend? He's not a friend. They just, let him out of the institution. If you can lose him, I'm just right over there. - Excuse me. - Sure. You know the French lady that came to talk about the semester abroad program? You know the one? - With the withered hand? - You're such a diva. It's so strange. You know, like, ever since that night at the party, even though I hadn't seen you in years, it's like we just picked up, like we'd never been apart. I know. I feel the same way. Even though you were with another guy, it didn't seem like you were. You know, I really don't want to hurt Navid anymore. So maybe for a while, we just keep our relationship on the down low. Relationship? Relationships are just... You now, they're just not my thing. - So, you don't want to... - Don't take everything so seriously. Oh, my gosh. We can still have a great time together. I'm such an idiot. How can you be depressed all the time? Snap out of it. - We're back on Annie now? - Little Miss Mopey, that's right. She's in high school, for Pete's sake. I don't know. I think high school can be pretty rough for some. Oh, please. Poor kids... they have it so rough with all the daily grind and - the peer pressure... - Wait. So this is Deb, again? Who is now totally in a huff with me about how to raise the kids. At least before, you know, I could go to school and vent, but... But this is Kelly again. Who now hides every time I come around the corner. - Well, imagine that. - What? Nothing. Go on. I don't know. It's just, we used to be... We used to be best buds, you know? I mean, what is it the kids say? Awkward! I've been calling for dinner. - I'm eating alone tonight. - But I made... How dare you talk to Mom about me behind my back! I'm sorry. I just... I think it's best if you don't get involved with her. She's dying, Kelly. Don't you get that? Don't you care about her at all? It's not that I don't care about her. It's that I really care about you. I can make decisions for myself, you know. I can take care of myself. Frankly, you can't. Excuse me? You're bipolar. Not that that's a bad thing. It's just a thing, okay? You are different. You can't handle intense stuff, and Jackie is intense. What she's going through is intense. It's going to bring up stuff that you shouldn't even be thinking about or dealing with, trust me. You can't decide what kind of relation ship I can have with my dying mother. Yes, I can. I'm your guardian, and I'm the one who takes care of you. Now come in to dinner. I wouldn't have called you, but I was just losing my mind, man. Going over every second of every day, just trying to figure it out. And then it hit me. What do you mean? You've known her longer than anyone. Of course, right. So, what's your take here? What do you think could have happened? I don't know. People are... - Complicated. - I tried talking to Ade but I got nothing. It's like she's trying to hide something. Don't let your imagination go crazy on you. All I can guess is, I let her down somehow, and she doesn't want to hurt me even more by telling me what I did. - I don't know, man. - All I know is that... I'm dying here. Another lovely dinner. And the chances of it leading to an even lovelier breakfast? You never give up, do you? I've yet to meet a horse I can't break. You know what? I'm in. You're spending the night? I'm buying a racehorse. I want Continental Accent. It's an extremely risky business. Which is why it sounds fun. But why be impulsive? I would hate to see you lose your money. Who's talking about my money? I've just received a generous gift, and, well, I have a spare hundred grand. - Sorry... forgot a blanket. - That's okay. You want a glass of wine? Yeah. Didn't really peg you as a picnic basket guy. My parents are Hollywood Bowl fanatics, and they never go without a full spread. It's nice that you learned from them. I just took their basket. You stole their food? They were seeing Barry Manilow tonight. Anybody lame enough to see Barry Manilow - deserves what they get. - You're awful. I'm such an idiot. I had a perfect life, and I completely sabotaged it. I just lost the love of my life. - What am I going to do without Navid? - Enough with the self-pity. This just happened, Ade. It's not like he's gone off to war or married some wealthy duchess. You can still fix this. You really think I can? He's a great guy, granted. But it's Navid, not George Clooney. It's not like he's moved on or anything. Wingman surrendering his keys, pilot, sir. I don't really know how they talk. I think you nailed it. - Call me. - What, me or him? Whatever, skank. Silver, Adrianna, follow me. God, Annie, you are so hot. We're a little exposed out here. We're okay. Unless someone's flying into LAX super low. Worse case, we'll just give them a thrill. We should probably start thinking about getting home. Oh, come on. Don't be a tease. I'm not being a tease. I'm just ready to leave. - It's still early. Come on. - No, seriously. What is the big deal? Don't be a prude. Your lips are saying no, but your body says yes. Mark, get off of me. I mean it. Take one step near either of us, and I'm calling the cops. Hope I didn't scare you back there, jumping out and all. No, please. I'm so glad you did. I just... I don't know... when I saw you guys leaving together, - I had a bad feeling. - Well, thanks. Will you tell me one thing? What got you all weirded out the other day in the cafeteria? That. Fully my fault. Honestly, I can't believe this, but it's cause of something that Mark said. Get out. That creep is dissing me? What did he say? Wait, let me guess. "Man, that Jasper, don't trust him." "He doesn't play football." "He doesn't hang up freshman by their underwear. He's a freak." Something like that. He said you pulled a knife on somebody. What? What a crock. I knew he'd make up some outrageous lie, but that, I did not expect. I got to give him props for creativity, right? I know,... that's what got you scared off. But it's cool. Yeah, but I'm... I'm not scared off now. Now there's no room for the cranberry juice. Your mom's magical hangover cure? - With cranberry juice. - You know what, honey? Let me take over for you, Harry. - Knock yourself out. - Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. A horse? You dragged me all the way across town to show me a horse? Say hello to Continental Accent. His sire was Liberty Ride and his dam, Frou-Frou. Both great champions. Have you been doing mushrooms? He's mine. A gift from Eduardo. And he is going to make me... us... a lot of money. Aren't you? Nice car Mark. I'd like to move in with you. I made a huge mistake. All that stuff about wanting to be alone? I realize now that's really not what I want. And, yeah, I'm going through some weird stuff right now, but... the truth is... is I want to go through it with you. So that's what the truth is? I thought it has something to do with the fact that you kissed Teddy. Whatever Silver told you, I can totally explain. You know what? You don't have to explain anything, all right? And, Silver didn't tell me.
