It's gonna sting so much more when I never talk to you again. I am tired of pretending that everything is okay When it's not-- we need to tell the kids About your birth son sooner than later. no, no, no. I caught her buying drugs. I'm a cop, you dumbass. -How old are you, anyway? -I'm 25, why? -I would literally do anything for you. -oh, my god. -You paid for my rehab? -yeah, I did. I don't think we can be friends if you're with ethan. I know that I can't stop him from dating other people. It just can't be you. So. So...? So, I have something That I would like to discuss as a family. When I was in high school, I dated tracy clark. Uh-- I'm sorry. That was just disturbing. It was a long time ago. When I was in high school, I dated tracy clark, And at the end of senior year, She... got pregnant. Very surprising, and obviously A big deal, but, um... Well, tracy and i, we weren't... Right for each other as a couple And weren't ready for the responsibility that a child would entail, so, We decided not to keep the child. The baby. Tracy was gonna not have it. So, basically, I went away to college And that was that. Only that wasn't that. Apparently tracy... didn't Not have it. She had it. A baby boy. She put him up for adoption. -You have a son? -no. Another son. a second son. I already have a son. Exactly how long have you known about this second son? Not long. at all We found out about two months ago. You've known about this for two months? All I can say is that I love you guys. I love this family, And this news doesn't change any of that. I have no interest in digging up the past. So why are you telling us now? Because tracy clark Is interested in digging up the past. She's already hired a private investigator, And she is planning on telling naomi. So you wanted to, you know, fill us in on your little secret Before the whole world knew. No secret. You are my daughter. You are my son. This is my family. This is what is important to me. I'm just really hoping that This doesn't affect us in any way. Okay? So? So... Dixon, what are you thinking? Well, ac-actually, I'm thinking I gotta go to school. Annie? Yeah. school. Better go. So? so. How do you think that went? Um... it... could've been worse. Ugh! what?! "i-i'm really hoping that this doesn't affect us in any way." It's like, what did he do? Did he practice last night in front of a mirror? Like, really? Maybe he was, you know, nervous About it or something, you know? yeah. Well, he had about two months to prepare for it. Come on. cut the guy a little bit of slack. Face it-- dad's a hypocrite. He tells us not to have sex, but when he was In high school he got tracy pregnant. Okay, plus, did you see The way he kept, like, glancing at mom the entire time and what was she doing, holding his cue cards? All right, um... For the record here, I just need to know. Are you mad at him because he rehearsed what he was Gonna say? because he has a son? Because he's a hypocrite? or, d, all of the above? Doesn't this bug you? at all? It's freaky. All right? but I'm cool. So, half your brother, and half naomi's? Yeah, but it's not like he's half her and half me. You're making it sound like some weird mythological creature, Like a minotaur or mermaid or something. Well, it's weird, though. Yeah, it's a hundred percent weird, And it certainly complicates things between naomi and me-- Which weren't not complicated before. I mean, she asked me to not date you at homecoming. Well, it's none of her business who you date. Yeah, I know, but... Well, we're kind of at a fork in the road here. I mean... Should you and me be you and me? Or should we be you and me? You know what I think? What? Maybe we should try to keep our relationship on the d.l. for a few weeks. You want to hide that we're seeing each other? Look, I want us to be you and me, But I think if we act like we're just you and me For a little while, it'll make things easier with naomi and that'll give her time to hook up with some other guy And she'll forget all about us. Okay. Yeah, that's another path... in the road. Think about it this way. We'll get to make out in secret places. Ethan. Oh, it's killing me. I'm so close to you, yet I-- sss!-- can't touch you. shut up. Hey, you want to hang out after school? We can be you and me after school. I really want to be you and me, annie. Me, too, ethan. All right, fine. go away. I'll see you later. Hey, there. hi. Don't tell me you're trying to be the rebound girl. With ethan? me? No. no rebounds. Not me. I'm going to let that ball bounce right off the hoop. Smart. Smart girl. So dixon told me about the new brother. That's intense. Understatement. Well, I figured maybe you want To blow off some steam, get away From the parental units for a night? Mmm. what you have in mind? Well, kelly's coming back this weekend, And I have to take advantage of my last nights of freedom So I'm thinking-- slumber party at my house. All right, I mean, it sounds a little pg-13, but... No! no, it'll be fun, and I would love to get away From it all-- and by "it all," I mean my family. I'm definitely in. So how are we doing? Great. except, Everyone's staring at me like I forgot to wear pants. I went to rehab. now I'm out, so what's the big deal? I think they're just checking out your cute hat. Thanks. It's uh... very pete doherty. In a, in a, in a feminine , non-skanky Uh, british guy sort of way. Thanks, navid. Jelly beans? You brought me jelly beans? Yeah. I was just feeling that, you know, you might... Deal with today better if, you know, you had some jelly beans. Either that or you'll just get high off the sugar. I-i can't believe I just said "high" be-be-because you, You wouldn't get high. It's okay. I like jelly beans. What's your favorite flavor? Popcorn. The most disgusting jelly bean Ever known to mankind? Uh, it's buttery and delicious. Okay, I was just about to say "just like you," And then I changed my mind. And then you somehow managed to say it anyway? True. ah... Mmm. isn't that yummy? I gotta go to class. "buttery and delicious." Seriously, navid, "buttery and delicious"? That's all you could think of? Hey. can we talk? Annie? -Naomi! -oh, can't talk. Geometry quiz. gotta figure out why a square is a rectangle But not every rectangle's a square. So. your dad and my mommy, Doing the nasty...are you as grossed out as I am? Yeah. I'm guessing I'm a little bit more grossed out than you. So when did she tell you? Oh, you know, at breakfast. She was all, "darling, good morning. Could you pass the probiotic yogurt? Oh, and by the way, you have a brother." Parents are clueless. No kidding. Hey, you bummed out about it? It's just... whatever. Well, you know what helps me when I'm bumming? Jimmy choo. Chinese food? Oh, god. Oh, kansas. No. jimmy choo shoes. Oh. god's gift to women. What are you doing after school? Today? um... today after school, i, me, um... Today I'm, I'm, um... Are you okay? are you having a stroke? No, i... i... Have no plans at all. No plans? what happened to "you and me"? Yeah. I guess I panicked. I mean, all of a sudden My mind was just a snowy snowscape of blank. And, I don't know... maybe this d.l. business Just isn't my cup of tea. No, no, it's cool, it's cool. You just got to be prepared In case naomi asks you to do something. You're an actress. Let's rehearse, okay? Okay, I'm, I'm naomi. Why, naomi, you're looking rather butch today. Okay, shh... Just give me a second while I get into character here. Naomi. Okay. Hey, annie, what do you say after school We, uh, hit up the polo lounge And you can watch me blow off david spade for the 80th time? No, naomi, I'm sorry. I'm busy. See, there it is, there it is, okay. So next time it's you and me. I invited adrianna, by the way. I don't know if she's gonna come, but... That's very sweet of you. Trying to be a girl's girl. It's a little new to me. Hey, naomi, Do you want to come to a slumber party At my house tonight? Kelly's still out of town, And we got to take advantage. A slumber party? How retro of you. What are you gonna do, braid each other's hair And put on face masks? Well, you don't have to come if you don't want. Oh, no, I'll be there, I'm just gonna bring my own face mask. These pores deserve the very best. Plus, I really have to get to know This family of mine, don't i? right, sis? You can wear your new jimmy choos. -Sure, -sis... Hey, we should totally play truth or dare. That way, I can get to know everything About this new sister of mine. Penny for your thoughts. A penny... in beverly hills? We're in a recession. Come on. what are you thinking about? About my dad's laugh. Is that a poem or something? 'cause I like it. Whenever annie laughs, you know, people always say, "oh, she sounds just like her mother." Well, now I know that somebody out there... Who has your dad's laugh? I don't need his laugh. I got my own laugh. Yeah, and your laugh probably sounds like your birth dad's. Yeah, maybe. You know, I've been wanting to ask you about your adoption, But I never really knew when was the right time. Well, I don't feel bad talking about it. I used to live with my grandmother in brooklyn. Dad wasn't in the picture...addiction problems. So when my grandmother died, I moved to kansas to be with my mom. So you knew your birth mother? Unfortunately, she was crazy. Not so big on taking medication, so long story short, Social services came And took me away. Do you ever want to see her again? Nah. I know the feeling. Come on now. it's cool. I'm not about to play myself a violin. I mean, look where I live. Look where I go to school. My super-hot girlfriend, hmm? And my family, I mean, come on. Yeah. Yeah, and I guess The wilsons saw how special you were. They knew they had to have you. So, uh, when you gonna realize that you just have to have me? Ooh, I don't know, soon. Shut up. Punctuality. I like that in a student. Thought I could get a couple seconds alone with you. Yeah, we can't really be alone here. You know, It's getting harder for me to see you every day in school. How do you think I feel? I'm supposed to be completely focused on this case, And here I am thinking about one of my teachers. Uh, that is why you can do the extra credit To make up the assignment. That blows, mr. matthews. That's life, kimberly. take a seat. So... I'm working on getting you Those "party favors" you mentioned. Cool. I'm, uh, looking forward to "celebrating." I don't love slumber parties. You still have to come, ade. I don't know. I got my meeting Students against destructive decisions. It's one of my preconditions for coming back and... Sadd? Sadd is right. Okay, so you'll come after. fantastic. I don't know, though. If you guys are drinking, I don't want to be the downer. You're being a downer now. The party's not gonna be all booze. It's about ice cream and cookie dough and face masks. It'll be really cute. There you go! hey! These are for you. I sorted out just the popcorns. You sorted jelly beans for me? Yeah, well, I'm a man of many talents, The majority of which are rather useless. Uh, I'll see you later? Okay, this took hours of freaky jelly bean sorting. hello? He's either ocd or he wants to sleep with you. He's just being dorky navid. Oh, yeah, well, dorky navid paid for your rehab. He wants something from you, clearly. Whatever. You're so going to have to use Your powers over him To get him to sort my closet. Color code. Nnaomi, Que pasa? What are you doing tonight? Oh, I have a date. mama celeste. You're eating pizza? Mm-hmm. And you can't reschedule? Oh, no, it would have to be something really special. You're making that guy run in so many circles He's gonna get dizzy. Mm-hmm, and I'm not stopping till he's sorting The mikes from the ikes and the goods from the plenties. Hey, got a call from our credit card company. They said there was some unusual activity on the card. Quite a significant amount of unusual activity. You know anything about that? Sounds unusual. I kind of bought some boots. Annie, that's an emergency card. I really needed boots? These? Items of footwear? They cost as much as a small car. What is this? where are you going? Silver's having a sleepover at her sister's house. I thought kelly was still out of town. No. no, you can't stay there If there's not going to be an adult around. Oh, come on, dad! Sorry, no party. It's a slumber party. It's a bunch of girls sitting around watching movies And eating pizza-- I'm nearly 16 years old! When you were my age, you were making babies. Annie, you are not going to the party. Rules are rules. And, and these boots, they're going back. No way! Yes... way. Are you stalking me? Because I'm over this whole "finding stalkers attractive" thing. No, no, no, I thought That maybe you'd want to go get Something to eat after your meeting. Yeah, I don't know. come on. Give a guy a break. Those were gourmet jelly beans And I got carpal tunnel from sorting. you owe me. Right. I owe you. Annie! That's the second time she snuck out since we moved here. We know she's at silver's. Let her stay there for the night. No way. we didn't give her permission. We just dropped a huge bomb on her. She's acting out. She won't talk to me. Harry, when she's ready to talk to you, she will. We have to trust her. Cheers. Yeah! Lime! Mm... Way to go, kansas. You sure you don't want another one? I am done for the night. Okay, annie? Mm, s-t-l me. We're out of lime. Then just "t" me, I guess. It works. All right. Cheers. We so should do this at my birthday party. What party? my 16th birthday party. My folks said I can invite anybody that I want. I don't think the 'rents meant that you could invite Mr. tequila here. Yeah, no. Ooh, I got it. We should play a game. here. Twister! lame. Hello? you don't play twister unless there's guys around. Why would you entangle your limbs with another girl's Unless a boy's watching? Hey, I'm glad you could make it. thanks for coming. Adrianna! You have to come to my birthday party, okay? Drunk? Getting there. I never. What are you talking about? You've been drunk, like, a million billion times. Okay, kansas, "i never" is a game.

Okay, dixon's sister In the room and getting nauseous. I'm just waiting for the right time is all. Oh, please, it's not like angels start singing. Right? you go. Okay, my turn. I've never... I have never been in love. Really? never? Nope. don't get sappy about it. Annie, your turn. I... I've never been drunk. Drink, drink, drink, drink. You know, when dixon first came to live with us, I completely flipped out. I actually fantasized About putting him in a cardboard box And mailing him off to taiwan. I don't know. I guess I thought, like, my parents Would love him more or something. I still feel crappy about it. Meanwhile, my darling sister won't even answer my calls. It's awesome. I was kind of hoping to start fresh With that new brother of ours. What? You know, my dad's been Cheating on my mom for a few years. My mother tramps around like a pussycat doll, And god forbid I'd ever want to talk to my sister about it. I was kind of hoping to have a relationship with someone Who doesn't make me Want to scream all the time. Sometimes, I just, you know, feel so alone. Hey, you're not alone. you have me.
