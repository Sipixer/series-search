No need to worry. Just be sensible, that's all. Check his e-mail, monitor his cell phone and follow him. - You spied on me? - It's never gonna happen again. - Cause now I know I can trust you. - I need some space. Hi, I'm Dana. I'm Dixon's birth mom. My son's birth mother has come to stay with us for a little while. - How's that going? - It's hard for him. - How is it going for you? - This anxiety was for nothing, right? Everything I'm feeling is valid. Where the hell is my car? Who do you think got rid of the one piece of evidence that's linking you to my uncle's death? You like somebody. You haven't told me? The problem is... I like you. You mind? This space is occupied. Come on. It's the last one in the lot. Annie, slow down. I know that you're freaked out over what I did, and I'm sorry. But I was just trying to help you. I don't want anyone to be able to link you to my uncle's death. Stop. You have to know I'll do anything for you, anything. You really want to do something for me? Leave me alone. Blazers, listen up. I've got a really exciting announcement to make. You guys are late. We have a new faculty advisor... Mr. Cannon, everyone. Mr. Cannon brings some street cred to the Blaze. He was a journalism major at Columbia, and he also interned at 60 minutes, before diving back into academia. Thank you, Navid. I see my role here as challenging each and every one of you to do better, dig deeper, find the journalistic truth in all the stories that we tell. - I have a question. - Yes. Hi. Naomi Clark. What happens if I like you said... dig deeper, find the journalistic truth, but it all gets edited out by Navid? That's because, - you don't cite your sources. - And if I'm protecting my sources? A friend of a friend of a guy you used to date? That's not a credible source. Actually, I do have to agree with Navid. If we can't verify thformation, then we shouldn't air it. We're not a tabloid here. But we can be. Ever heard of making a good first impression? If you'd like me to review any segments you're unhappy with, I'd be glad to give you my honest, unbiased critique, but I'm warning you, I have very high standards. They couldn't be that high, or you'd be working in news... And not bossing a bunch of wannabe kids around for what, 20 grand a year? If you're done, I'd like to discuss the next Blaze edition. - But I'm not. - Yes, you are. Why do we even need some stupid faculty advisor watching over our every move? It's like 1984 all over again. I hope not. I look horrible in shoulder pads and a perm. Come on, Sil, just tell Ade how bad cannon was, please? Or not. I was wondering if you want to have lunch today. Sorry, I'm taking a history make-up. Got to run, actually. Everything good with the world again? I just asked him to have lunch, and he had to make up a history test. Obviously, he's still pissed at me for spying on him. That, or he actually has to make up a history test and I'm just getting worked up over nothing. Or both. You know you can't leave anything to interpretation with men. Next time just ask, "am I in or out? 'cause I'm not a *** to ** everyday Just to get rid of zits and pms." That's your solution? We're not even having sex yet. No wonder he's blowing you off. Come on. Right, Ade? Whatever. I got to run my locker. I will catch you guys later. Sure. Wait! Wait! Stop! Do you need a ride? I'm all right, thanks. Come on, let me drive you. All right, thank you. Sure, the Cavs have Lebron, but Shaq, - he's a bloated old man! - You are preaching to the choir. I led the petition drive to try to force him out of Phoenix. I didn't even see you there. So, any dinner requests? How about my famous mac and cheese? Heavy on the cheese, light on the mac. Sounds good but actually, we're about to go out and watch some march madness. Don't worry, I know it's a school night. We won't be out late. Aren't you forgetting something? Bye, mom. - Peace, dad. - Peace. Those two seem to be getting along well. Yes, they do. Again, I gotta say, I was a coward with the Jen thing. It's over. I know, I just... - I should've just came out and... - Can we talk about something else? Like, anything in the world? Sure. - Like what? - I don't care, you can pick the subject. Ferrets. That's random. We just passed the Beverly Hilton, which reminded me of Paris Hilton... Who I think was once caught with an illegal ferret. I read the tabloids in my dentist's office. Fascinating insight into that mysterious brain of yours. Check out those two. Someone's reenacting pretty woman. Are you okay? That was my stepdad. And that wasn't my mom with him. Peach Pit Team Saison 02 Ã‰pisode 16 Clark Raving Mad Navid said you wanted to see me? If we're going to be working together, you owe me an apology. No, you owe me an apology. You were insulting and belligerent. Not exactly the apology I'm looking for. It's kind of like pulling off a band-aid if you do it really quickly, it hardly hurts. I'm sorry, but life's too short. I'm kicking you off the Blaze. - What? - You heard me. I'm sorry for whatever it is you think I did wrong. Let's see, you were disruptive, rude, - irritating... - Fine, I'm sorry for all of that. - It won't happen again. - You're absolutely right, it won't. Please, don't do this. I finally found something that I'm really passionate about. I want an extracurricular on my resume for college, but it's not just that. I'm good at this. I'm good on camera, and I like reporting. It could be something that I want to pursue. Katie Couric's like a toothy munchkin compared to me. Please. Give me another chance. I'm sorry, I've made my decision. What do you want? Just name it, I'll do anything. Please, I'll do anything. Are you offering to sleep with me? What? Because that would be completely inappropriate. Like I said, you're off the Blaze. Door's that way. At the risk of having our first argument, you are completely wrong. Marshall Mcluhan invented the term "channel surfing." He would've definitely considered the internet a cool medium. It's active not sedentary. What if you use the internet to watch a movie? Mcluhan considered movies to be a hot medium. - You know what is really hot? - What? That you even know who Marshall Mcluhan is. Are you kidding me? Understanding media: the extensions of man was my goodnight moon. That's hot. I'll see you later. - You need a hand? - Nope, I have it. I know it's kind of weird, your bandmate dating your ex and... No, it's fine. I knew he was gonna move on. Not with the bass player, didn't see that coming. But it's rock and roll, so, it's fine. So, we're cool? Yeah, totally. I hope you're putting some money on Villanova. Villanova, really? I've been on a roll lately. All right, Villanova it is. After all, you are my good luck charm. And if I win, we can split it. When we win... I'll take you to that Lakers game on sunday to celebrate. I'd love to. But unfortunately, I won't be here sunday. I have to head home. - Already? - I gotta get back to work. I have responsibilities. When you emailed, I dropped everything and came running. That's cool. I tell you what, tomorrow, we can come here for one final celebration. Watch the game and wait for our ship to come in. That sounds great. I want you to watch the tape, and you'll see the flaw in your mechanics. You look at the flaws. I want to relive that 135-mile-an-hour serve. - See you tomorrow, man. - See you later. What's going on with us? So much for small talk. I know why you're acting all weird. I was a jealous, paranoid freak. But what I don't know is if my jealous, paranoid freakiness is something that you can get over or it's something that you can't. I don't know, either. I want to be with someone who trusts me. I do. Now. Until I get a call, or run into someone from my past. Come on, that is not true. I made a mistake. And I'm really sorry. But the unfortunate thing here is that I can't prove to you that I'm not gonna do it again unless you... Unless you give me another chance. So, how about it? What the hell is... wrong with you? - Nothing kicking your ass won't fix. - Kicking my ass? Stop it! What is going on? Are you okay, Jeffrey? I'm fine. He was hiding. He came out and took a sucker punch... 'Cause I saw you coming out of the BW, making out with some bimbo. What?! You are a bastard. I can explain! I don't wanna hear anything you have to say! Sweetheart, I can explain. Colleen! You've been avoiding me. No, I've just been really busy with the band and stuff. I don't blame you. I put you in a really bad position. But your friendship means more to me than anything. I don't want to lose that. Me, neither. So can we just pretend like I never told you about my stupid crush and just go back to the way things were? - What crush? - Great, 'cause I have lots to tell you. Me, too. - Did you hear about Pete Duffy? - What? - He singed his eyebrows off. - Once it gets out that I have been dealt a grave injustice by Cannon, I'm sure the student body will demand I get my job back. I wouldn't hold your breath on that one. Come on, you witnessed my humiliation. We agree that he wasldn't hold out of line. No, "eh"! He was totally out of line. He didn't pick on anyone but me. They go for the weakest of the herd. Weakest of the herd? I've heard you called many a thing, but that would be a first. I know this isn't what you want to hear, but you were the one out of line. I cannot believe you're taking his side! Will you kindly remind Silver what a jerk Mr. Cannon was this morning at the Blaze meeting? I don't think he was the jerk. What is wrong with you people? It's like we were at two different meetings. I was at the one where you wouldn't shut up. You're won't get a lot of support on this one. I should! Because that guy is a total douchebag! You're not blowing this out of proportion a little bit? I'm not! Do you know what he said to me... mr. Cannon? He said if I wanted back on the Blaze, I had to sleep with him! What?! That's sexual harassment. No kidding. So, can I finally get your support against this guy? Sure. Oh, my God. I got my tools. I'll leave the boat for now, maybe I can come back for it later. I hope so but if not, I can deal. I just had a long talk with Jeffrey. Don't worry. We've survived a lot worse than this. We'll be okay on our own. I'll get an after-school job, if you need. - You don't have to do that. - I'd do anything for you. I know, and I appreciate that. Jeffrey and I have our issues, I won't deny that. But you don't just walk out when things are going bad, you work through it. I know it's not what you were expecting, but please understand. Liam, say something. I've got nothing to say to you. It's so romantic. - They're totally... - meant for each other, I know. I love this scene. Sorry. No, please, after you. Go for it. I'm not saying I'm not athletic. I never really sparked to traditional sports, per se. Except for dodgeball. I was always pretty good at dodgeball. Is that so? Whatever I lacked in hand-eye coordination, I made up for in rage. Are you in the mood for some dessert? I wish I could- I gotta get back to the Blaze. They have this really interesting... Long time. - Tara, this is Silver. - It's nice to meet you. You, too. Tara and I used to date. Did you? That's cool. You know what? I have passes to a screening for the new Tarantino film. You guys want to come? Silver has to get back to school... now, actually. But, I'm free. Unless, that's not cool with you. Me? No, of course, it's totally cool. Great! Don't worry, I'll take care of the check. Thank you. All right, it was nice to meet you. You, too. You guys have fun. How have you been? - So funny bumping into you today. - I know, tonight sounds great! Emergency meeting at the blaze tomorrow afternoon. Be there, big announcement! It's Naomi. So, emergency meeting tomorrow afternoon. I will call you back. What's wrong? What's going on? I caught my stepdad cheating on my mom. Sorry. You know what really sucks? She's staying with him. I know exactly what you're feeling. My mom put up with that same crap from my dad for... ever. I still don't get why. - Do you min I crash here tonight? - Not at all. Tonight, tomorrow, as long as you want. I've been thinking about you. How's the whole stepdad situation? Not great. - I really need to talk to you. - Not now. - Please, it's important. - It's fine. I'll see you later. Can you just give me five minutes, please? - I'm gonna be late for class. - Three minutes, one minute? Come on, what's 60 seconds out of your damn life? Don't touch me. Come on, please, I'm sorry. I just... come talk to me. I love you. Damn it. It's Dixon. Leave a message.</i> It's me. I was just wondering where you are. I thought we were meeting at the house. Maybe I got it wrong. You know, I'll just meet you at the restaurant. And after all that he goes, "you don't mind if I go with Tara, right?" - It's obvious what he's doing. - Bonding that Tara chick? - Wrong answer. - Testing me. I'm not buying it. Knock, knock! I wanted to bring you both a flyer for our band's gig. I hope you can make it. - Wouldn't miss it for the world! - "The glorious steinems"? "Live at the beach club." What is a steinem? That disease you get in your eye? Beats me. They had the name when I joined. Are you guys kidding? Glorious Steinems? Gloria Steinem? Come on, she's only one of the most important feminists. Editor and publisher of miss Magazine. You know what a steinem is, it's a beer mug. Yes, that is totally it. Can I talk to you guys about something? - Something complicated? - Talk. Complicated's my second language. So, Gia told me she has a crush on me. How did you handle it? At first, I totally freaked out and completely avoided her. And then, I got over it. And now... I don't know. We have this really great connection. And last night, I started thinking about it, about her. Not as a friend, you know? Really? We were watching this romantic scene in a movie and... I kind of just stopped watching the movie, started thinking about Gia. And I don't know why. Maybe I'm just trying to rebound since Navid. But... Like, I know I need to move on. I didn't think I'd be moving on with a girl. - Until now. - Crafty! A little lady-lady action might be just the thing to get the persian stallion back in your stable. Seriously, guys, what do you think? If I'm having these feelings for a girl, does that mean I'm gay? It's a little gay. - What? It is. - I don't know, I don't think sexuality is black and white. It's more of, like a spectrum. There are some people who are 100% gay, or 100% straight... That's true. Gay guys, straight guys, they all want to sleep with me. But honestly, I think most of us fall somewhere in the middle. It depends on where we are and who we're open to falling in love with. - At least, that's what Kinsey found. - I'd actually make a good gay icon. - Think about it. Cher, Liza... - you know, the important thing, just don't get caught up the labels. How does Gia make you feel? - Really happy. - Like more than "friendship happy"? I think so. Drinking chai? That's very interesting, I'm sure you hear what they say about chai drinkers. No, what do they say? They say that they're very possessive about their papadum. So, tell me, how are things going with Dixon's birth mom? - That good? - I feel like a horrible person. You're not horrible. You're human. How can you not feel conflicted with her being here? Thank you. For everything. For listening to me vent, for understanding where I'm coming from. Of course. You say of course, but believe me, that's not what I'm getting at home. You should be. You deserve it. - What are you doing? - I misread your signal. I'm sorry. That should not have happened. I'm married. I've gotta go. I didn't see you today. I was just wondering, is everything okay? Just laying low. Wicked hangover. From a Tarantino movie? Tara and I blew that off. I woke up on a chaise, covered in sand, with a headache like it was the morning after st. Paddy's day. - That sounds like a lot of fun. - Yeah, it was. Anyway, gotta get back on the court. Bye. It's open. What happened today? I thought we had plans. Guess I forgot. My bad. Are you upset cause I'm leaving? You'd think I'd be used to that by now. You know it's not for good. Whatever. Listen, this last week, reconnecting with you, it has been amazing. I want to be a part of your life. Why should I believe you? If you wanted me to be a part of your life so bad, why have you never reached out to me? Not once, not ever! Even now, I had to contact you. You're my mother! It's not supposed to be like that. I didn't contact you because I didn't want to disrupt your life. But that didn't stop me from thinking about you every single day. You were always in my prayers. Always. You gotta believe me. And all this time... I thought you'd moved on. Never. You're my baby. I want to be a... A part of your life. All right? And I promise as much as you want me around, I'll be around. There comes a time when we are called to a higher power. When the little people wake up and realize, together, we're a big person. Together, we can fight the tyranny that would control us. We must speak up now, or forever hold our peace. She's kind of a smorgasbord of metaphors there, isn't she? But suffice it to say, I have been mistreated by cannon. So, we, the people, must protest and demand I be reinstated and that cannon be sent back to that godforsaken nerd-nest. What's going on? Cannon kicked me off the blaze, so we are striking until I'm allowed back on. - We've got to get an edition by friday. - Tough tatas, honey. Union! Union! Union! Stop! Look, all right. Everyone, okay? Let me just go talk to mr. Cannon and see if I can get him to give you another chance. - Okay? - Fine. I will see you at 1300 hours tomorrow. I believe that's lunch period. So, Dixon tells me you're leaving us... I gotta get back to work. - It's been nice having you. - Thanks. This is awkward, but, I need to tell you something. Yesterday, I went to the restaurant to meet Dixon. And I saw you at a cafe with a handsome man. Yesterday? Right, you know, that was my yoga teacher. That's a rather close student/teacher relationship you have there. It's not what you think. That kiss was a mistake, on his part. I was completely shocked and taken aback, I told him so and no on certain terms I'm going to tell Harry everything the minute he gets home. Are you sure that's a good idea? What do you mean? I mean, I've been around you two. There's a little tension. And jealousy, it's the number one killer of relationships. Believe me, I used to temp for a divorce lawyer. I think that this is probably a family matter. Family matters always trickle down to the kids, you know, One of your kids I gave birth to. Anyways, that's just my two cents. You have a great family. Don't risk it. Picked up a couple more dvd's on the way over. But, sexual behavior in the human female seems a lot more interesting. I'm confused. If sexuality is on a spectrum, does that mean that most people choose to be straight because it's what they know or what they're used to? Maybe some people do. What does that mean? That being gay is a choice? Because I definitely don't believe that's true. I don't think it's a choice for a lot of people. As far back as I can remember, I've liked girls. But that doesn't mean that everyone's like that. Some people might fall somewhere in the middle. That makes sense. Then again, everything I'm reading makes sense until it doesn't make sense, so... Why are you reading those? 'cause... Because... I think I like you. Whatever you're struggling with, I don't think you're gonna find the answer in one of these books. No kidding. So, how do I figure it out? We could kiss, and, I don't know... See how you feel. That sounds like a good idea. Good or gross? Good. - You're a good kisser. - I don't get a lot of complaints. But was it, something you liked and got out of your system? Or something you liked and want to do again? Something I wanna do again. So, what does that mean? Just that you kind of dig me. And that if I asked you out on a date, you'd probably say yes. So, you wanna go out on a date? That would be a yes. All right, you're right. You said I was jealous and I am, okay? You win. I tried to tell you, but you were like, "I can handle this." Whatever. I'm sorry, I just don't get it. You make this huge play to be with me and then now now you're willing to throw it all away cause I made one incredibly stupid jealous mistake. What's going on? I don't know, I just... I don't know. What if it wasn't a mistake? What if you're right? What do you mean? I didn't have to go to that coffeehouse. I could've emailed her, but instead I left the door wide open. Yeah, but nothing happened. It could have. Anything could happen to anyone at any moment. I'm not just anyone. I'm Spence Montgomery's son. My dad's had four wives and cheated on all of them. You're not your father. How do you know? I don't know. I've never cared enough about a girl to stay faithful before. But I care about you a lot. And I'd hate myself if I ever cheated on you. I trust you. Now, I'm warning you, I'm not good with this emotional stuff. Where you think you get that from? It is genetic. All right, I'll call you. I promise. Every week. Yeah, and maybe we can skype and watch a game together. Okay, I'm not sure what that means, but... Sounds like fun. I almost forgot. What's this? We won the bet. That's your half, plus a little something extra to make up for all the missed birthdays and Christmases and sits from the tooth fairy. I'll see you, son. You know where all my shirts went? **** for a little while, you should have a drawer. Thank you. All my drawers were filled, I cleared you space underneath the bed. You are sweet. I like playing house underneath with you... Really? This is a little awkward. You watching us? Sorry. We just want to talk to you about Mr. Cannon. That. Don't worry, it's all good. Navid talked to him; he's agreed to let me back on the Blaze. Isn't that great? Yeah, I guess, except for everything he said. That stuff was awful. You really can't let him get away with it. With what? What'd he say to you? It's nothing, honey. No, I want to know what happened. Cannon told her that she could be back on the Blaze if she slept with him. - What?! - It's okay. I got what I wanted. - Let's all just forget about it. - Forget about it? You can't let him get away with this. It's sexual harassment. Come on. You gotta come forward. You don't want to be a doormat, like both of our mothers were. You've reached Liam Leave a message. It's Annie. I just wanted to check in and, see how you're doing. Cause we didn't get a chance to talk earlier. If you need anything, call me. I told you to leave me alone. What do I have to do to get that through your head? Don't worry, I got the message loud and clear. I just wanted to say good-bye. Are you going somewhere? You could say that. Listen, if I can't be with you,
