Yeah, I had it noticed. You know, maybe you should chuch that dinosaur. No way. This is the XL44. I got this when I was a rookie. They don't make 'em like this anymore. I can't imagine why. You know, you could just turn it off. Sheriff, you got a minute? Can you please talk to your sister? This obviously belongs with metal alloy. This with cellulose. And this... Complex non-irradiated silicon. - I was recycler of the month. - Good for you, Doug. - Hi, Lex. - Hey. Jack, do you know they recycle absolutely everything in this town? If I could just get Vincent to be a smidge more conscientious. Could you do it someplace else? I don't think eggs over garbage is on the menu. Garbage? What century are you from? Chuck's the majordomo for Eureka's recycling program. - "Why throw it when you can chuck it?" - Chuck it. I'll meet you at the office. That can there is actually full of violations. I hope there's gonna be some pretty hefty fines, Sheriff. How about we just give him a warning this time? Okay. But I'm watching you. See ya later, Lexi. Vincent, can I have a green tea, please? Aunt Lexi. Look at you. - You like? - Oh, it's om-mazing. - You're taking a class? - I found this program. An amazing program. It's a three-day workshop with Swami Goldstein. I'm dropping her off this afternoon. Remember? We talked about this. Yeah, you said you wanted to try yoga, not miss three days of school. Well, I mean, the swami's at the ashram only this week, and I talked to all my teachers, who said I could make up my school work. And I told her it was fine. This is a once-in-a-lifetime's opportunity. - You told her it was fine? - Zoe's a wise young woman, and she can make her own decisions. Sweetie, I know you really want to go, but you're not skipping school to go to yoga, okay? Fine. You know, I just hope Eureka yoga gives refunds on clothes. Jack, you put that uniform on, and you think you can tell everybody what to do. Green tea. - No cellulose. - That's the spirit. I'm late for my tour of the Eureka recycling center. Why don't you do everyone a favor and take the day off from helping people? Be careful what you wish for. How did you find this thing? Trust me, I've been researching this for a long time. All right, let's get to work. It was my understanding that one single incorrect entry could freeze this lock, permanently. Only if you believe the research on these little security systems. Come on, there's only 6.8 billion possible combinations. I designed a code-breaking program for this cryptex. What's that? Zane... you've done the impossible. It's an elevator shaft. That's a hell of a drop. There's a lot of debris. It's gonna be dicey. Radios aren't gonna work down there, so now's the time to tell me what I'm looking for. Another entrance. If one exists. Stupid algae, why do you only grow in the basement? Come on, Pilar, can't you just tell us what it is? I don't know what it is. That's the whole point. It's a door. You think, Mr. Third Highest IQ ever measured? They must have sealed it off when they built the basement. Let's look inside. Don't you think we should tell someone about this? Like a teacher? - Someone old? - We'll just look around a little. We're old enough to make our own decisions, don't you think? Talk about old. What is this place? We gotta save her. It sounds like some kind of ambient interference, but I won't be able to really tell until I open her up. But she'll be fine. I'll do everything I can. Carter. Fantastic. Took you long enough. Hello. You need some help? Could you just get me out of here? Sorry. Somebody told me to take the day off. You okay? I think you should get out of the car, Lex. I just can't open the door. It's like some big, nasty aura. It's a reactive perimeter field. The more you move, the harder it holds on. Great, what's it doing in the middle of the driveway to the recycling center? No, this is a secure GD antenna station. Obviously you have the wrong clearance. If there's a force field on the road, maybe they could put up a sign? - There used to be signs. - Get me out of here. It's starting to squish me. - How do we turn it off? - The switch box up there. Can I be of any assistance? - What the... - Happy to oblige, Miss. Well, you don't see that every day. This should do it. You are approaching a secure area. - It's crushing me! - <i>Please withdraw your vehicle.</i> That's a laser turret. You're not powering down. You're expanding the perimeter field. - You're making it worse. - <i>Withdraw your vehicle immediately.</i> You have five seconds to comply. Lex, get down! That's not five seconds! Drop the amperage! Drop the amperage, then power it down! Come on, quick. Easy. Come on, a little effort. - You all right? - I think... Here we go. - You all right, Miss? - Yeah. Thanks. On my Jeep? Take care, little lady. Just a moment. Not the Jeep! Not to worry. Just a small technical glitch. Who was that masked man? Trouble. Season 3 Episode 06 Phased and Confused (v 1.00) Sadgeezer & Team Projet-SG. They're hydroponic strawberries dipped in organic chocolate. I grew them myself. Lexi, I heard you were... down here. I brought you these. Oh, Chuck. Are these recycled? - Well, someone's popular. - Always. Okay, boys, I think visiting hours are over. - After you. - No, no, no. After you. - No, after you, really. - No. It would be really awkward. Oh, for the love... Both of you, go. Just... Well, everything seems fine. No residual particle halo, no radiation echo. How much radiation was she exposed to? Your average microwave oven. She's... she's fine. Why? What Sheriff subtle is trying to tell you is that I'm pregnant. His unmarried sister is knocked up. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - You too, uncle Jack. - Thank you. By the way, we have a problem. There's a guy running around out there with a funny costume. You mean you? He saved me. The only problem you have with captain Eureka is you think he's gonna steal your thunder. My problem is that he's gonna save someone to death. Wait, wait. Captain Eureka? How about "Captain Incompetent"? Because the guy wears a mask and a cape doesn't mean he's a dangerous lunatic. Yeah, it sorta does. Okay, it does sound a little concerning. You have any idea who it might be? Well, he can fly, if that narrows it down. Flying has always been the dream of man. - By the way, how's Lexi feeling? - Oh, she's fine. - Did she get my balloons? - Yes, I'm sure she did. I have some questions about flying machines. Machines are the past. We've developed a therapy to create biological gravity-wave repulsion. And I'm sure I'd be impressed if I knew what that meant. The holy Grail! Independent flight. Up, up, and away. Behold. The door said human flight. We're a decade away from human trials. But our work with rabbits has been extraordinary. Well, they look normal enough. I mean, no wings or propellers. Yeah. All the changes are on the inside. I'll show you the serum. Well, the guy that I saw had, like, rocket boots, you know? Burned the paint off my car. Must have been my skywalker 2000s. They're incredible. Makes you feel like a bird, a plane. Or Superman? Dr. Gaz, can you tell me where you were this morning? Here, in the lab. I like to come in early. The rabbits get lonely. And does anyone else have access to the rocket boots? Sadly, no. All projects involving rocket-powered footwear were shut down. Spotty performance. We singed more than a few toes with those buggers. But man, when they worked. Oh, no. They got out again. Well, that's new. The place is like an underground City. We've been walking for, like, an hour. We should really go back. But don't you want to know what this place is? I know it's creepy. Do you hear that? Yes, it's common sense saying get out and go to chemistry class. I think it's coming from in here. Come on, you never go toward the creepy noise. Have you never seen a horror movie? Oh, my God! Did they get you? Yeah, Pilar, the rats tripped me. - Are you okay? - No, yeah. I'm... I'm fine. Okay, please can we go now? This way? Okay... which way's out? - This way. - That way. Oh, that's just perfect. Dr. Gaz admitted that he'd love to be a superhero and he had access to flying technology. What? Carter, everyone at GD wants to be a superhero. It's part of being a scientist, of dreaming up this kind of technology. Really? Everyone? Wonder Woman. Was it the lasso, or the bustier, or... Sheriff, Sheriff. Heard about your radio woes, and I have the answer to your problem. An aspirin? - I could use it. - It's a cyberkinetic comlink. Say good-bye to your old broken-down radio and cell phone and hello to modern convenience. - I don't like the sound of that... - You're on the list of beta-testers. She figured you could give it a real-world workout. Put it behind your ear. It burrows into the skin. Isn't that cool? No. Not cool. It's actually amazing technology. It taps into the synapse activity. Just think about the person you want to call and say their name. Like what? Like, call Fargo? Douglas Fargo speaking. I can hear you in my head. Yeah, neat, huh? Creepy. Call Zoe. - It shocked me. - Yeah, there are still a few kinks. Just avoid names that start with a "Z", or an "A", and anything with an umlaut. Fargo, get this out of me. Now. You know what? Just try it out for a few days. You're gonna love it. You gotta take this more seriously, Lex, it's different. I am taking it seriously. I'm just saying that you're gonna be a mom, and your whole life is gonna change. Hopefully I'll be the kind of mom who trusts her kids to make good decisions. That can't be good. What's that? It smells like bad eggs. It's gotta be some kind of gas leak. Call Henry. Henry, hey, yeah. I need the fire department out here on Magnesium Road. There's a pipe that ruptured at some sort of pumping station. That's a rocket fuel pumping station, Jack, so stay back. Even the slightest spark could set it off. Zane might be able to shut it down from GD. - Okay, thanks. - What'd he say? He said even the smallest spark could set it off. Call Zane. - You okay? - Yeah. Wait here. Oh, no. Don't help, man. Seriously. Please, stand back. You're making it worse! Amazing! He did it again! Thank you, Captain Eureka! So you still think he's Captain Incompetent? Yes, I do. All in a day's work, little lady. So he's a bird, and a fireman, and a ghost? I want to know how a fueling pipe suddenly bursts. As far as I can tell, the fuel pipe was fractured by a plasma surge, which I've never seen before. - You think someone did it deliberately? - Someone, like, in a cape? He's a vigilante, and he's dangerous, and he's a klutz. Unless I catch him, this ends one of two ways. Either he hurts himself, or he hurts someone else. So please, tell me about your cutting-edge firefighting technology. We have projects including temperature-resistant fabrics. Fireproof gasoline. Do you have anything that really blows? We have the best blowers. - And that's for scuba diving? - For Maureen. Our robotic whale. She tracks migration patterns. We developed high-energy air jets for her blowhole. I mean, they're small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. - Okay. Can we see Maureen? - Oh, yeah, sure. Here we are in Cape Cod. And, oh, look, this is us at Sea World. We had such a good time. Now she's in the South China Sea migrating with a pod of sperm whales. She's a bit of a flirt. - Where do you keep the spare blowholes? - She has the only working prototype. Does your sister like whale watching, by any chance? Work, you stupid, stupid cell phone. Concrete absorbs the digital signals, okay? - You're wasting your time. - Thanks for the tip, Mr. Wizard. Any ideas on how to get us unlost? - That's not even a word. - Guys... Okay, I speak six languages. What's "bite me" in Chinese? Guys, seriously, freaking out on each other isn't gonna help us get out of here, okay? Zoe, let me look at your leg. You are not okay. Oh, it's the rats. They've come to finish us off. Okay, guys, can we please just go? What's with the screaming? Zane, what are you doing here? Took the words right out of my mouth. Well, it looks like GD's only blowhole is currently vacationing in the South China Sea. Oh, I miss Maureen. I ran a full inventory check. Every nut and nuclear reactor is accounted for. - How'bout the rocket boots? - Dr. Gaz was telling the truth. All prototypes were discarded when the project was shelved. And he was in his lab all morning. Well, they had to come from somewhere. Most superheroes make their own equipment. He's not a superhero. He's super dangerous. Yeah, but most superheroes are also misunderstood. That's why they hide their identities. Plus, the ladies love the latex. That's true. - There is always a girl around. - Okay. I have real work to do. No, hear me out. I mean, Superman had Lois Lane, right? Spider-man had Sally Jane. - Mary Jane. Don't you read at all? - Okay, Carter, what is your point? We find the damsel in distress, we find Captain Clumsy. This is truly sad, Jack. Sad, sad, sad. Lex, this isn't about me. He's not a threat to your manhood, Jack. You help people, so does this guy. Of course, he does do it anonymously, which is a tad more noble. It's not gonna be so noble when somebody gets hurt. Especially if it's you. - He's just trying to keep people safe. - How safe was it to start that fire? Henry said that the pipe was heated from the outside until it ignited. - So of course, you assume... - I also checked the road where you got trapped in the car, and somebody did remove the warning signs. I think that this guy wants to impress you, and given his talent for screwing up, eventually you're gonna get hurt. I think this is the fastest way back. This is awesome. This place goes back to the'30s. These are analog computers. Look. Don't touch. Okay, it's a prehistoric apple store. Can we please go now? The emergency power's holding out. - We can rest here a minute if you want. - No, I'm fine. I think that might be broken. Maybe. Let's just keep moving. No, wait! What? Maybe it still works. No, no, no! Damn! What's happening? Security system. It's locking us in! What happened? It's a drop-lock security system. When the power runs out, the doors shut tight. You knew about this and you didn't bring some sort of extra power supply? What kind of a bonehead do you think I am? It's in my bag. On the other side of that door. Jack thinks this trap for Captain Eureka is really going to work? Carter put out the word you were hurt in the fire and you blame Captain Eureka for the whole thing. He put out the word? How, bat signal? No, better. He told Vincent and made him promise to keep it a secret. The crew of the space station probably knows by now. - Have you heard from Zoe today? - I'd answer that, but I'm in a coma. I'm serious, Lex. I called Tesla. She never showed up for school. I called her. She's not picking up. Do they even let you use cell phones at this ashram? You think she went? - Good for her. - Good for her? I need a coffee. You can't just show up in her life and superimpose your own morality. You don't even want her to have a little bit of independence. I do. She's not your daughter. And I want her to be safe. She's not lost in Baghdad. She's an hour away at a yoga retreat. - And she's mad at you. - I don't know if she got there. - Do you? - I'm sure she's fine. Well, this retreat was your idea. So you can drive up there and bring her home. Okay? I'm gonna go find Jo. This whole ambush is a bust. How are you feeling? Oh... not so good, actually. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. - How did you get in here? - I move like a jungle cat. I'm sorry that you got hurt. I hope you can forgive me. I'm fine. I'm... coma-free. Honest. Okay, Jo will drive you... home. So sorry. - Hold it. - Take care. That's the creepiest thing that's ever happened to me. I can't believe it. He's gone. Not all of him. Is that what I think it is? Looks like Captain Eureka gave us the finger. What don't you understand about look, don't touch? I'm really sorry. Why? You just left us in here to suffocate. No biggie. It's okay. You didn't know. - How much air do we have? - Plenty. An hour, maybe two. An hour? Maybe longer. We'll be out of here way before then, right, Zane? You're working on a plan. I found the ULF transmitter. It can only send numeric messages, but it's a chance, if we can get power to it. The emergency batteries are dry. What about these lamps? They aren't electric. They're chemical. Peroxyacid ester. What... hey! I was writing my will. Is this enough power? Maybe. If we can network them. Come on, give 'em up. If this works, it'll only give us a few seconds to transmit to the outside. And we can only send numbers? Yeah. Okay, so... what do we say? You better figure that out. No prints. The collagen in the skin ridges has merged with the wall, and even the DNA has been mangled beyond recognition. Well, it shouldn't be too hard to find a nine-fingered man in this town. Yeah, or one who can walk through walls. - Any idea how he pulled that off? - Well, it's just theory, but... given the state of this finger, I'm gonna say that he's using some kind of quantum phasing. And... now's the part where I ask you to say it in English. All matter in our universe exists on a single quantum frequency. It allows us to interact physically with things around us. Our man might be able to shift his frequency just enough to allow him to pass through solid objects like water through a strainer. That didn't work too well for Captain Nine Fingers. Well, part of him must have shifted back to our frequency as he passed through the wall, and it got stuck. - Any chance we can reconstruct the DNA? - Doubtful, but... I can try. We don't have a quantum phasing department, Carter. Well, he didn't buy his walk through walls machine at walk-through Wal-Mart. Someone in this building is working on something like that. Well, section two was developing a device a couple of years ago, but the project was scrapped, they never built a fully functional prototype. Well, his machine wasn't fully functional either, and we have a finger to prove it. Seems to specialize in outdated GD technology. Wait. What happens to a program when it's scrapped? They lose their funding, scientists move on to new projects. No, no... to the things. The jet boots, the old blowholes? You said they build prototypes. Where are they? They're gone. They're discarded. Discarded... or recycled? Why throw it away when you can chuck it? - Hey, hey, Jack. - What, is that the DNA? No, no, your police radio picked up a transmission from an old military frequency. - Numbers... - First set of numbers I've seen before. Longitude and latitude, and it's the same location where Thorne had me scan for radiation. - What's the last number? - 4891. I don't know. I thought it was an altitude or a Z axis point, but none of that makes sense. I know that these two sets of numbers are trying to tell us something. I just don't know what or from whom. Okay. Well, thanks. Keep at it. Let me know what you find. I have to go catch a nine-fingered superhero. - Sure. - Yeah. Chuck? Anybody home? "Prototype graveyard." I'm guessing we're in the right place. Yeah. Chuck, can you give us a hand? We got a recycling emergency. Yeah, so do I. Could use a hand here. What is this... tanning therapy? No, the hollow cathode lights are holding him in our quantum frequency. Wasn't easy getting him in one piece, but this should keep him for a while. Make sure you recycle these bulbs. Mercury nitrate's terrible for the planet. All right. Can you not tell Lexi about this? There's not many... girls... there's not any girls who talk to me like she does, you know? And I don't wanna ruin that. She's gonna want to see you, Chuck. You guys were saving the world together. It's just not as much fun as saving the girl. Hang in there. He actually incorporated the phasing device into the vest. The stolen phasing device. But it's still a neat piece of textile engineering. I mean, press a button and walk through walls? But he wasn't wearing the suit when we found him. Which is why the original project was discontinued. The device uses molecular vibration to change the quantum frequency. Now, after enough exposure, the body adopts the new frequency and then starts phasing uncontrollably. He's already lost a finger. He's not gonna leave pieces all over town? Each of his molecules is phasing randomly. Now, fortunately for him, electricity can bridge quantum frequencies. The only thing holding him together is the current within the cells. That's not gonna be enough for long. He's headed for full decoherence. I mean, he will literally fall apart. We gotta be able to do better than grow lights. Well, this is every file from the original project. Every test subject ended up phasing uncontrollably. - Well, how did they save them? - They didn't. They tried everything from point energy treatments to graviphotons... nothing worked. But that doesn't mean we're gonna give up trying. Right. That's obnoxious! What's that beeping? The... you know, the phone. Never gonna get used to this. Answer. - Carter. - <i>I can't find her, Jack.</i> Hey. I called the number 12 times... nothing. And I've emailed the Vashti retreat. Zoe never got there. Do you think she ran away? No. No, I think we're beyond that. I... think. She was just really mad, and I think I just made it worse. - I'm gonna be sick. - We... we'll go looking for her. If she didn't want to talk to you, I wish she'd have left you a message. Yeah. Well... wait. I think she already did. - What are you looking for out there? - I'm sorry? 123 north, 39 west. What's there? Sheriff, my office is involved in a number of sensitive projects... listen to me, would you tell him, or I swear to God, I'll claw your eyes out. You must be the sister. The resemblance is uncanny. My daughter's missing. Henry picked up a message on an old military band. It was a longitude, latitude, and 4891. That's Zoe's birthday. Can you help me? Of course. This complex is massive. Prewar. - What, late'30s? - I believe. That's before Eureka was built. What's down there? These are the only remaining records. The entire complex was buried - and forgotten a long time ago. - Well, till Zoe found it. And the only access was a collapsed elevator shaft. No, if we extrapolate from these plans, there has to be a utility shaft out from here. - It would have been sealed off. - No. It's right under Tesla. Where the kids got in. - If we open the doors... - Done. It's a huge facility. We don't know where she is. They sent a ULF signal, which means the transmitter has to be... right here. In the control room. If you only got one signal, they probably lost power. How do you know so much about it? Okay, so it's a drop-lock system, standard security before World War II, which means that if the complex is under attack and loses power, the doors drop and lock. According to the plans, the doors are 20 inches of titanium and steel. Okay. So we gotta cut through. No. Not enough time. - Time for what? - Carter, they're running out of air. Those doors are airtight. And I got the message an hour ago. - We gotta figure out how to get there. - If we restore power, we can open the doors, we have to turn the switch on in the main generator, which is... here in the generator room, which means you have to get through four doors. We can't cut that fast. What if we don't cut? I've got a crew pulling the Nd:YAG laser from the fusion reactor. We'll have it in place in a few hours to melt the doors. Too long... with this I can go right through 'em. But once you use the device, your body will start changing frequencies. Eventually, you will be in a permanent phase state. I'll get in there, I'll fire up the generator. You can fix me later. But we don't know how. We're working on it. - Look, Carter, I can't lose you. - You're not gonna lose me. If I don't come out, I'll be stuck in a door. Easy to find. Okay, it's not funny. People have already died because they couldn't find a way to stop the phasing. They didn't have Henry and you to work on the problem. I'll go. Chuck, stay under the lights. Those photons are the only thing keeping you together. No, I can make it. I wanna help. Easy, Chuck. Let me take this one. It's Zoe. Okay. I'll be back. He'll do fine. I always felt really brave in that suit. It's not the suit. We reprogrammed the transmitter for ULFs, so we should be able to talk to you. And the chances for decoherence increase with the density of the material. Got it. - What'd he say? - You're gonna end up like Chuck. Going through steel walls is only gonna make it happen faster. - Got it. - The steel will adhere to you. No matter how much it hurts, keep moving. If you stop, you're gonna leave pieces of yourself behind. - Good tip. - Once you're inside the room, the generator switch will be straight ahead. And Jack. - Please don't screw up. - Thanks. - You okay? - All in one piece. That really hurts. That hurts. Think they got our message? I don't know. Two down. The interior doors are made of a thinner alloy.</i> So you should have less of a problem going through them.</i> The generator room should be straight ahead about, oh, 90 meters. Jack, this door is much thicker. It's gonna hurt. Don't stop.</i> Last door? I'm in. I'm turning the vest off. The activation switch should be somewhere on the panel. I'm looking. Intrinsic field generator "A". I got it. Start. That's my kind of button! Tiny problem. My hand just went through the console. - He's phasing on his own. - Didn't think it would happen so soon. - It did, so what do we do? - Working on it, Jack. Hey, guys, I'm pretty far in. Can I just call Zoe? - What was that? - Nothing. Just Fargo's stupid phone. I swear, if I still have hands when I get outta here, I'm... gonna... kiss you. Pardon? Henry you said that electricity can jump quantum frequencies, correct? Yeah. That's what's holding you together. Could I use the spark in this implanted phone to jump the start button? That could close the circuit. Yeah, or short out the panel permanently. But you know what, we don't have time to fight about it. So just try it. Okay. Here's to flipping a coin. Call Zoe. Doors are open! Zoe? Dad? I'm hallucinating. Anyone else? Please tell me you're really here. I'm really here. I'm a little... out of phase, but... I'm here. I'm so sorry I went in there. I was mad and... stupid and... - I was trying to prove something. - Honey, it's not that bad. And when things went wrong, you kept a clear head. I'm... proud of you. But that doesn't look good. We've isolated a frequency that will stabilize the phasing. So you did solve it. We just needed the right motivation. It was a tricky problem. Had we been off by one cycle per second, we would have accelerated the decoherence. - Oh, I'm a guinea pig! - No. No. - We've already tested it. - He insisted that we try it on him. Brave man. Sleep well, Captain Eureka. - Oh, and Jack? - Yeah. I fixed your old radio. Well, I guess I made it out in one piece. Yeah. You okay? When I didn't know where she was, I was just really scared. Oh. She's okay. I don't know if I'm ready for this, seriously. I don't know if I'm ready to be a mom. You'll be fine. It gets easier? No! No, not in the least! It... But you adapt, you know? And... and you're right. Look, she can take care of herself. - I hear Zoe's gonna recover. - She's fine. Thank goodness for that. Ms. Thorne... ever since you got to this town, you've been looking for something. Now, I believe that everyone has the right to their own secrets. But today... four kids almost died. Tell me what's going on. No. That's it? Just no... no? Sheriff Carter, I'm very sorry for what happened to Zoe. I never wanted anyone to be hurt by this. You've got to believe that. I do.
