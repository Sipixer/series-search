help me find the back door. Well, it's by used games, but you're really not supposed to go out that way. I won't tell anyone if you won't. He's on the move. FBI! Zane Donovan, get your hands up! Freeze! Excellent response time. You guys take Lake Street? Went up by Lincoln Park. Less traffic. Yep. It's me. I think I got a live one. Probably not the best idea. That comes out on the pistol range. Please tell me you're my lawyer. No. But I think I can keep you out of jail. What'd you have in mind? You wanna hire this guy? He's the best in his field. Oh, yeah, if screwing up is a field. We need a particle physicist, Carter, and he's the most promising one out there. He was accepted to MIT at the age of 13. Expelled. Accepted at yale. Expelled. Cornell. Oh, guess what? Expelled. Not before winning the Spadaro Foundation Award for superstring theory. He set the bar so high, they haven't even bothered to give it out since. Here's a resume highlight. "Just stole $3.1 million "from the U.S. Border patrol account for drug interdiction." Allegedly. And can't we just agree that the war on drugs is really a moralistic assault on individual liberty, hmm? - Or not. - Hello, Zane. Welcome to Eureka. - Good to see you, Sam. - Right back at ya, Doc. So we got one brainiac at the standard recruitment rate $25,000. 25,000 for this guy? For 30, I'll throw in dinner and a movie. But I won't go past second base. I'm not that kinda boy. I'll give you a check. Be a sweetheart and make it cash And throw in some singles. I'm chasing down a paleontologist in vegas. Well, who's this guy, and how do I get his job? Sam lovejoy, Global Dynamics' talent scout. I'm the guy who assembled this dream team of intellectual prowess. So you're the guy I can blame for all the crap I deal with. I just find 'em. What you do with them after that is not my domain. - He's all yours, Sheriff. - Don't want him. Well, you got him. - Allison, just... - Technically, he's still a prisoner. - He's your responsibility. - Until when? Until you think he can be trusted. So... What do you do for fun in this town? The Projet-SG Team presents: Timing:   Golgi, Linwelin, Moochie, Ricana Transcript:   swsub.com Edition:   Golgi, Linwelin, Moochie, Ricana. Proofreading:   Golgi, Linwelin. - Saison 2 | Episode 1 - E=MC? Obsession with firearms can be a sign of unfulfilled sexual appetite. I'm not saying that's you. But if it is, I'm at your service. Jo! Don't shoot the prisoner. Don't... - If I just wing him? - No. Down. Allison wants him at GD alive. Better use these then. Bracelets. They're geodetic coordinate transceivers... They'll show his location within one meter. And if he tries to run, it's also got a restraint field. An emergent graviton field generator? - Very cool. - If he tries to escape, hit the button. Oh. What button? Got a button. Gimme that. Arm. - Where we going? - Just go. At least you know it works. Your doctoral thesis was on the origins of the universe, right? - The first one. - Hey, is this the new kid? Who you calling kid, Spartacus? - Cocky. I like him. - You would. I have something to show you. Holy crap. You actually built it? What, exactly, did we build? A chaotic inflation device. It will recreate the origin singularity in this observable containment field. The big bang. Supercritical ignition will take place 24 hours after we start the device. And if it works, it will show us the first moments of the universe. And potentially rewrite every cosmological theory we know. Uh, I don't mean to be a wet blanket, but won't that blow up the planet? Didn't think of that. Good you're here. But seriously, this thing's going to pump out a ton of hawking radiation. And it's gonna go supernova. So please tell me you have a plan. You can just shut it off? Well, actually, no. Once induction is started, it's essentially a runaway cyclotron bomb. That's a bad plan. Relax. We have four generators creating a layered particle field that will contain the explosion. - And one of us... - Heads. Me... Will be in the lab continuously to adjust the field. And as long as the current density doesn't go below 200, the field will hold. I'm checking the levels on the containment fields. - No. - Carter, it's okay. We want Zane to feel comfortable. He's part of the team. Thanks, Dr. Blake. I really appreciate that. I don't know about the rest of the team, but I'm starving. So what's for lunch? When the device ignites, field must be at full strength. So let's go through the containment protocols again. - Got 'em right here. - It'll hold. Well, I don't want to take any risks. Scientific leaps require risk. That's why GD is here, to pull together great minds so we can take risks. Those self-esteem classes are really helping out, Nathan. - Got a great team. - Well... It's safe. Here's to scientific leaps and the beginning of the universe. Vincent, baby, gimme a bird on a raft, keep off the grass, and pin a rose to it, will ya? Chicken on toast. Onion, no lettuce. Sherrif? Hey, Vince, gimme two breasts, all wet... J-just chicken on a plate. Two chickens on a plate. - How's our boy doing, Sheriff? -  He's behaving. The best ones are always wild like a porcini mushroom. Tough, sometimes, sure, but that's what gives this town flavor. I was that way once. Ah, grazie. - You miss it? - Sure. These are my people, my peeps. I been to every state of the union, and this is the only town I fit in. This is my family. You know, I... I happen to have a knack of finding new members of that family. If you could find a member without a felony record, that would be just super. Thanks, Vincent. Where's he going? Ow! What the hell? I was getting napkins. Sorry. My bad. I'm not eating that. What? It's chicken. You know how chickens are raised? - Don't. Just let me enjoy my meal. - Jammed together in a windowless warehouse, wading in feces until... They get decapitated. Or pecked to death. When you eat that chicken, you're eating all that hate. Come on. I have to sleep in here? At least you're not wading in your own feces. GD has an apartment for you, but you're a criminal. Don't deserve it. You may think I'm a criminal, but my mom loves me. She wouldn't appreciate you insulting her boy. Enjoy your stay. And... don't bother. It's unpickable. Ithaca lock company. Sloped tumblers. Nice. Can I at least watch tv? The Mariners are playing the Yankees. Sure, sure. It's gonna be a good game. No pay channels. Right. Current density, stable. 390 electrovolts. In 24 hours, we'll get to see how the universe began. Any historic words? Let's light this candle. - <i>Are you sure you wanna do that?</i> - I didn't have any lunch. Pork rinds have over 960 milligrams of sodium per serving.</i> All right, you know what? New rule. No one's allowed to say anything about what I eat. Whatever you say, Jack. I can hear you judging. Oh, hey, what's up? You and your job can be really annoying. Yeah. Tell me about it. You know, Jasper Cole was gonna ask me out. But he didn't. Because of you. Yeah, that's right, Zoe. I'm controlling him with my mind. No, 'cause you're the Sheriff, I'm the Sheriff's daughter. And I have this big, fat label right across my head, and that's all anyone sees. - I hope you're happy. - Honestly? If being the Sheriff's daughter keeps you date-free for a couple months... - Months? - Or years. Then, yeah, I'm pretty happy. - How are you, dad? - Pretty good. Yeah, no, pretty good. Yeah. That's right. Right? Morning. You want some breakfast? How... This panini press makes rocking quesadillas. - Who... - Magic of the Internet. This works like a wireless keyboard. The IR Signal talks to the receiver in your computer. Took some curveballing getting the pad togo on the web, but had delivery guys flying in and out all morning. Give me that. Give it to me. - You're sending all this stuff back. - The restocking fee's gonna be killer. Who paid for all this? About that. You really shouldn't leave credit card info on your hard drive. That's just poor security. Oh... My... God. Watch him. On the upside, I got them to raise your credit limit. Yeah, you're welcome. Don't even try. You may get to him, but you won't get to me. Jo Lupo. - Yeah? - I got 19 boxes from Liza's lingerie... And can I just say God bless? I had to guess the size. You should really try everything on. I'll make popcorn. You don't really need him, do you? I dunno. Who? Zane Donovan. You... you can find some other particle physicist, right? Somebody without a felony record. I suppose so. You gotta go tell Allison... So I can take him back to the Feds and start rebuilding my credit score. - Okay. - Great. What you doing? Watching. That looks bad. Shouldn't you be watching this instead of that? This is funnier. Didn't you say that if we were below 200 we were in trouble? Hey, I was watching that! Am I wrong? Shouldn't we make these numbers go up? Maybe that'll help. Maybe? See ya. He wasn't acting like Henry. Couldn't remember what he told me yesterday. - And where the hell is Stark? - I don't know. You were saying how dangerous this experiment is. What happens if Henry's asleep at the switch when the big bang goes boom? It's bad, isn't it? Yeah. Do my shoes match my dress? - What? - Just look at me for a second. - Wait... No. I'm sorry. - No, it's... How do you feel? Hungry. Do you feel like you're thinking clearly? What was the question? You gotta focus for me, okay? You gotta get on your phone, and you're gonna have to call a meeting of experts. Good. Good. Wait. A meeting with who? Anyone involved in that experiment. It's gonna explode if you don't keep an eye on it. - Yeah. - Right. Oh, Wait. Do I need to push 9 first? Carter, I'm kind of busy. Can't run here every time you call. Thank God you're normal. Started to think I was the smartest one here. We got a major problem. People are regressing. They're starting to act dumb. Dumb? So what's the protocol? What do we do? Only one thing we can do. Pull my finger. What do you mean, they're stupid? I mean stupid. Like... Stupid. stupid! Carter, you can't catch stupid. This may be my favorite conversation of all time. Look, something happened to Allison and Henry and Stark and who knows else. But it happened  in the middle of that chaotic inflation thing. You left that thing running without anyone watching it? We got it covered. - Sort of. - Sort of? You gotta clear out that building before that thing blows. - It could take out the whole facility. - Don't worry about it, we'll fix it. What? We always fix it. We don't always fix it. Henry does it sometimes, or Stark, or Allison. I'm just saying, we usually have smart people to lean on. Hey, I'm smart. I'm plenty smart! I mean... science smart. Don't get snappy. - OK, you're coming to GD. - I'm not touching that experiment. If I start pushing buttons, I could accelerate the decay of that field. - Need the guy who designed the machine. - You said they're all dumb. We need to figure out why. Let's start with a list of all the people affected. How you feeling? You feel dumb? No. You? How could you tell? Might be just affect the people at GD. I'll head up there, you pull evacuation plans. You should help. - How you holding up? - Well, people keep calling. I was making a list of scientists for you. Okay, here it is. Everybody on this list works for a different department at GD. What do they have in common? - Well, they all work here. - Thank you. Yes. Very helpful. Have you shut down all the... dangerous projects? No. That's a good idea. I'll write that down. No, no, no, I'll do it! I'm the head of Global. - Okay. I know, I know. - Just listen, I... Look, I pulled all manuals from the... the c-chaotic thingy, and... I don't understand any of it. We're gonna figure this out. I promise. I'm scared. - I feel like I'm losing myself. - Why don't you stay here? S-sit down, and you stay at work. And I'll go find a doctor. A normal doctor. Okay? We're gonna sort this out. I hope. Excuse me. Are you... dumb? Sorry. What's the square root of 3,006? - Don't know. - Apologies. I was never any good at combinatoric math. But if you threw me a couple of Chomsky nominal form equations, - I'm your gal. - Great. There's a dumb virus going around, you gonna help figure out what's causing it. A dumb virus? Yeah. Wish I could. But, see, I'm a vet. And if you brought me a marmoset with cognitive decline, I'd be happy to help. But... I... no. I... don't work on people. - Today you do. - No. You don't want me to. It's not good. You're wearing one of my presents under there, aren't you? Come on, you can tell me. Okay. I deserved that. This is nice work. How did you get enough phase power for the field and the biometric lock? Redox battery? No. It's a nano-titanite cell. Sweet. How do you keep the amp load from shorting out? It's a dielectric waveguide. Nice. Hey, do you have the specs on that chaotic inflation test? Why? Why don't you let me take a look at the containment structure for you? And if I'm helping you, maybe you could help me. And here it comes. There's only one thing I want from you, Jo Jo. A sandwich. Yeah, the Geneva Conventions state that I get a sandwich for lunch. And you'll read this. And help. Yeah. Marco! - Marco! - Marco!</i> Polo. One of you says Polo. The game is Marco Polo.</i> God. - Polo! - Polo!</i> Tell me you found something. Well, I'm not sure, because this really isn't my field. However, everybody I've tested seems to have a critically low level of GABA. I didn't know I had any GABA. Gamma amino butyric acid. It's a neurotransmitter. Okay, and if you don't have enough, it... - Lowers intelligence? - It could, yeah. Critically reduced levels cause Alzheimer's disease in monkeys. Okay, so where's it coming from? - Air conditioning, water coolers... - I have no idea. And our neuropharmacologist is currently playing candyland. Okay... Gather everyone who's thinking straight, meet me in the conference room... Fast. Conference room. All right, we got a botanist, a math theorist, a chemist, a nutritionist, and a... lepi... potomus. - Lepidopterist. - Right. Butterflies. Fantastic. All right, everyone, if you wanna gather around, I trust you've been briefed. You all know that the big bang device is in danger melting down. And the people who built it are incapacitate. So... who do we have who can help with this experiment? You know, it's not their field. You need a physicist or maybe a molecular theorist. Great, we got a room full of geniuses and all we can do is eradicate plant rot and do triage on a butterfly. Let's switch gears. All right. What we have to do is cure someone who can help us. If we can find out what's knocking down the GABA, maybe we can reverse the mental decline. Right? So, who can help with that? Anyone? GABA knockdown... - You. What do you do? - Epigeneticist. The butyric acid cycle could be affected by any number of factors. Enzyme overgrowth, - radiation exposure, a virus. - Radiation can cause this? If it disrupts the TRNA synthetase. Okay, well, the chaotic thing - was pumping out a lot of radiation. - No. I don't think so. I've done studies with radiation on animals before, and that device would have to be tuned to a precise wavelength in order to cause this effect. What if somebody was tuning it on purpose? - Ooh. Well, it's possible... - They'd have to know big bang nucleosynthesis and string theory. Yeah. I have a guy in my jail cell who might know those things, and he'd think it was pretty hilarious to turn everyone at GD into a moron. Alright. Work on curing Allison and all the others. Any of you with a medical background, you go with Dr. Glenn. The rest of you... Start learning physics. Carter, we got a problem. Tell me about it. No, it's about Zane. Are you sure you locked the cell? Of course I locked the cell. We gotta find him. Well, we can track him with these. Or even better... He got out of the bracelet. He... How? By mistake... I may have told him how to hack the lock. All right. Thanks, sergeant. The state police are on every road out of town. They'll find him. No, they won't. He's good. He knows how to hide. Well, we've got the GD computer. It's running probabilities for any escape route, every phone call he's ever made, every map he's downloaded. No one in this world knows any better than this computer. Someone might. That's awesome. I know. Hey, where is everybody? Carter had me send 'em home. Something about a... chaotic... Something or 'nother. Ah, was it that thing I helped build? Yeah. I remember something like that. You okay? Not even. Can't keep a thought in my head for, like, ten seconds. Car's busted. Nothing to do. That's bunk. Still the smartest guy I know. Not saying much. What if this doesn't get better? I guess we'll just be dumb together. You know, breaking and entering's just a bad idea. Well, I must say I'm impressed. What did you do, refocus some of your satellites to pick me up? Figured 50 miles from Eureka was far enough. No. You vacationed here when you were ten. I figured it's off the main roads, a place to hide out for a couple of days first. Well, I guess my FBI file was more detailed than I thought. It's not in your file. Then, that computer of yours must have an amazing predictive algorithm. Didn't use a computer. I called your mother. You called my mother? I need to know what you did. Okay. You were right. That cell has a damn good lock. I had to order a new master key off the Ithaca lock web site. They run a pretty tight ship. I had to give your social security number. That's not what I'm talking about. What did you do to the big bang experiment? - What are you talking... - What did you do to make them stupid? - That's crazy! - All right, this isn't a joke anymore. Okay? This is serious. I need them back on their game. You think I would intentionally mess up that experiment? - Yeah. And I'm running out of options. - Well, I wouldn't. Because it's beautiful. If that thing up there works, it's... It could change the laws of physics. Then why are you running from it? As I see it, there are two sides. You're with me or you're against me. It's your problem. Why should I help? Because if you'd stop being a selfish jackass for more than 5 seconds, you might discover you could be a part of something. A community. What makes you think I give a crap about finding a community? Because we all do. And you're smart enough to know that. - He's just standing there. - He's thinking. Well, he doesn't look like he's thinking. He looks sick! That's because containment's down to 14%. When that chaotic device blows, that field's gonna fail. You got 43 minutes to find a way to make it stronger. Yeah, so figure it out. And the answer is... Clear the building. - Anyone who's still here, get 'em out. - Non essential personnel are gone. Focus, all right? You're one of the top guys here. You not only won the Spadaro foundation award, they don't bother to give it anymore. Yeah, they stopped giving it out because someone stole Mrs. Spadaro's money. They hacked her system. Even I couldn't find how. If I couldn't help her, I can't help you. It would take me 18 hours to rebuild that thing. And if it blows without containment, it'll cut right through the metal shielding and gut the building. Well, you're all we've got. So... Could you bring in more shielding? That's good! It would take at least 100 tons of metallic hydrogen sheets. - That's not good. - How about another field around the field or double it or reinforce it with something? - Duct tape! - Yeah, like duct tape. It's a layered particle field. The only way to reinforce it is with another layered particle field. - Keep going. - Like an emergent graviton field. - The bracelets. - They're in the car. Go! I'll crack the control circuits. Well... So does that mean we're good? All right, we're going to build a second force field to contain this one.</i> I need binned gradients and a way into the aiming circuit. Danger... Containment level critical. - Guys, this is where you say something, - I think it was... - Red. - Or red-like. - Yeah, definitely. - Fantastic. - Found it! - Awesome! We're in business. Here! Got 'em. - How much time do we have? - Not much. - Not helping. - What else do we have to do? The bracelets generate charged gravitons. If I can jack into the aiming circuit, get the timing, I might reinforce the field to contain the explosion. I have not a clue about anything you just said. He's gonna contain it. - What? - I'm sorry, Jack. I just realized this is how you must feel all the time. Thank you, Henry. Very kind. I think you want to turn on that extra shield now. No. I've gotta time it right. I overcranked the snot out of this thing. The field only lasts three seconds. Not yet. Not yet. Don't let me die in this crap town. Now! So that's what all the fuss was about? Are you kidding? It's the big bang, the beginning of the beginning. This data's gonna keep physicists busy for 50 years. It kinda looks like a scoop of... rainbow sherbet. I think it's... It's pretty. Not as pretty as you. Oh, that's so sweet. How are you feeling? Kinda hungry. The machine's off. Why is everybody still acting like a moron? Because the experiment wasn't the cause. Are you sure? The experiment produced hawking radiation. And all of these tests prove that doesn't affect brain tissue. Um... So what's causing this? I don't know. And I don't know how to reverse it. So what do we do now? We don't give up. Okay. Okay. I called the CDC and the NIH. They're on their way. Good! What are those? The CDC is the Center for Disease Control, and the NIH is the National... Something of Health. No. Anyway... Dr. Glenn is gonna be taking all the... affected people to GD for some tests. You're a real good friend, Jack. I just... I just feel bad 'cause I keep things from you. - What are you talking about? - The Beverly stuff. You know... What she did to Kim. What did Beverly do to Kim? Maybe you could find out. You're really good at that stuff. Yeah, sure. Sure. How... That's... That's cool. - Can I try? - Oh, yeah. Stay with me. We're talking about Kim. You... You can have a turn right after me. Sheriff, come here! Come here! Yeah. Hey... Sam, good. We could use a boost of brain power. Meet my latest and greatest... Madame Ofenskaya. - Charmed. - Nice to meet you. She's pittsburgh's best astrologer. Slap her to a telescope, you'll be talking to aliens by Kwanzaa. Don't you mean astronomer? What's the difference? Oh, crap. Well, you can get in line for the yo-yo. Now Sam's got it, he didn't go anywhere near that experiment. Right. Hey, Vincent, can I get another chicken san? It was dee-lish. Oh, sorry. We're fresh out. Vince, you can order some more. From where? From right there. You are smart! And you're not. - And he's not. - Can I... Let me yo. - I wanna... - No, no. Henry... did you have some tasty chicken yesterday? Sure. We all did. Right. I didn't. Neither did Zane. I'm a vegetarian. Oh, please, Sheriff. That sounds kinda nutty. Maybe. But everybody who was affected had your chicken. Do you use growth hormones? Tetracycline, nafcillin? My chicken is completely organic. Right, okay. Maybe something's getting into their feed. I need to see your livestock. - Where's the rest of them? - He's the only one. Took me seven years of somatic cell transfer and DNA stripping to make Chester. He's a clone? He has ears, you know. Little rhode island red, mix in some golden montazah, a dash of lakehorn and... He's the perfect bird. Aren't you, chester? Yes, you are! If you only have... If... If you only have one chicken, then where's the meat come from? Oh, this may be the grossest thing I've ever seen. Where do you think chicken comes from? From chickens. Chickens that have been murdered, but not anymore. The avian holocaust is over, my friend. So you're growing independent parts from stem cells? It's a breakthrough. I used to clone the whole chicken. Now I just grow the parts people want to eat so I don't have to kill anything. If you're growing... Meat with no brain, then... Is it safe? It's perfectly safe. It's organic. And with my new grow lights, five times as productive. I just installed them. Maybe your grow lights are making the meat five times as stupid. So, disconnected from the neural net, the only way you can make these... Pieces of meat grow is if you flood it with bicuculline. Yes, but that's organic. It's a plant extract. The grow lights enhance the process. But it's also a GABA blocker. - GABA. Hey... - Yes. It's depressing the GABA production, and it's causing the cognitive decline. Oh, my god. I had no idea. Do we have to tell Chester? He'll be so ashamed. That'll do it? The sulfonate should flush out the biculline and bring the GABA back into balance. - Maybe. - Well, why wouldn't it work? Because I'm winging it here. Maybe is the best you're going to get. I'm gonna be okay. I... I have to go first. They're my people. Don't worry about it. She's very smart. It'll work. Okay, this might hurt just a little bit. I'm actually not very good with people. I'm used to giving shots to mangabeys. What's a mangabey? No idea. Hold on. There. Good. You know, as scary as it was being dumb, it was also kind of liberating. Speak for yourself. What, you found nothing positive in the experience? Maybe one thing. So, all the facts of the world at your fingertips again? Hen oida hoti ouden oida. Either that's very profound, or you're badly brain damaged. What's the project status? Well, everyone at GD wants to get their hands on the data. - All big bang whores. - They'll have to wait. You get first crack at it. After Nathan, of course. - Thanks. - Well, if you will excuse me, I've a building full of people who are behind on their work, starting with those two. And you can get going as soon as Carter thinks you're ready to be on your own. So... Any idea when that might be? When you're too old to run. Nah, go. Find the secrets to the universe. I think I'm gonna get some pie. - Vince, can I get a slice of pie? - Sure. Wait a minute. I keep one bomb from exploding, and you think you can trust me? No, it wasn't that. It's was Mrs. Spadaro. Turns out she's giving her award this year because someone made an anonymous gift to her foundation of $3.1 million. You gonna turn me in? There's a federal statute protecting the anonymity of charitable donations. So... Mrs. Spadaro's money is safe. - Thanks, Vincent. - Yeah. Thanks. I guess you want these back. I'm sure you'll find some use for them. Thanks. The ballet. What? Take her to the ballet. But if you get out of line, I will make those cuffs permanent. Thanks for the tip. It's all right. You okay? I'm 16. My parents are divorced. And I live in the weirdest small town on earth. Yeah, you know, I'm awesome. You're also the sheriff's daughter. Oh, yeah. Than for reminding me. Honey... People use labels to make their life easier. You know, which is fine. But... You define who you are. You have to... Break people's expectations. Oh, my god. That's Jasper. That's cute? Yeah. Okay, you know what? It's time to break expectations. No, that's not what I meant. That's your dad. Yeah, but... he's cool with me going, if you still want to. To my parents' lake house for the weekend? Sweet. I mean, if you still wanna go. Oh, my god, yeah. I mean, I'm so there. No, you're not.
