No. We have Henry. - I was an engineer. - As in trains ? Space shuttles. Jack Carter, U.S. Marshal. Allison Blake, Department of Defense. come on.Let's go for a ride. What are you doing !?! one minute I'm driving my delinquent daughter back to LA, and the next I'm in the middle of the freakin' Twilight Zone ! Wellcome to eureka Walter was our top quantum physicist. Something went wrong with his experiment. My orders are to contain this area until we figure this out. I don't understand. It's a promotion. Oh, you mean the sheriff ? You can do this, Jack.You can make it happen. So you had no idea Walter was involved in some espionage ? There were phone calls late at night.I think he must've been working with someone else. Drink this. It'll make you feel better. A lot of us are still in shockabout the tragic events that have brought us here. The loss of...walter and susan perkins forces us to question if the work we do is worth the risks. Eureka was bornfrom the idealistic vision that by advancing science, we can control it for the greater good. Clearly that's not always the case. We can never forget walter and susan. Their legacy is in our hands now. Their friends,their family. Their son. Walter and susan,you will be greatly missed. - I still don't get it. - what's that? Susan committing suicide. I mean,I know it sounds callous, but I don't carehow bad things are. Once you have a kid, you don'tget to just...check out. Well,my daughter zoe saidpretty much the same thing to me when I told her I wasbeing transferred to eureka. Taking your life and takinga job are hardly the same thing. In this town?I'm not so sure. I don't need you to tell me I don't have a placeto put my stuff. I know that. The question is,where is my stuff That I don't have anywhere to put? Lupo. Yeah,yeah,I know. Tracking numbers and corporate policy but-- - it's for you. - Yeah,can you take a message,please? No. It sounds urgent. Hang on. Hello,jack carter. Really? A ghost.Very mature. Look,it's very convincing. But I get it.You haze the new guy. Big laughs. I gotta go. Uh,hello. Yeah. Hello? You still there? Oh,come on. Great. Thank you,jo. I think I may have lost my only chance of getting my stuff back because I had to takea crank call about a haunting. - I didn't set that up. - Yeah? I should believe you...why? Carter... this is a townfull of scientists. Everyone knows there'sno such thing as ghosts. Where is walter? You were saying? -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> sync:YTET-gagegao -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font> Eureka Season 01 Episode 02</font> I'm not sure this will all get worked out,ms. Perkins. I need to see walter now. Walter was obviously trying to hurt me,and when I-- what?What are you all staring at? Sorry if we seem a little... unnerved,but we justburied you this morning. You're unnerved? My parents called mein hysterics because they got an invitationto my funeral and a message saying that theyhad a grandson who needs a home. Which was alla big surprise to me, seeing as how I'm not dead and I've never had a child. Yeah. You win. We're just trying to figure outwhat's going on. Then get walter in hereand ask him. - You didn't tell her? - I was getting to it. Tell her what? Walter's dead. Walter'S...dead? Yeah,he--he--he sort of,um... blew himself up. Oh,my god. What--you--you'renot joking. I'm sorry,susan. hold on.If she's susan perkins, then who did we...? You're staring again. Yeah,um,do you mind if I askyou how you and walter met? I was a grad student at mit. He was a postdoc. We got marriedright after graduation.And... he wantedto start a family, but...I wasn't ready. One morning,this guy came to the doorand wanted to talk to walter about some top-secret job. He wanted to go. I wanted to stay. So we separated. You do realize we aregonna have to verify that, so we can,uh,sort this thing out. How long is that gonna take? I'm not really sure.It's not like we havea standard form to undead you. Tell me you're kidding. 924/B. In triplicate. We'll still need to confirmyour identity. - How are you gonna do that? - We can do a dna test. Oh,we can do betterthan that. But we're still gonna needto do some digging. - Oh,you mean I gotta go back to the-- - yes! - Well,someone's gotta get me a-- - that's right. Just do what you have to do. I just want to get backto my normal life. Yeah,I can relate. - County coroner,huh? - Board-certified. Pretty cool,huh? I call it an "omniversal"remote. I can run all this equipmentby remote control. That's super,henry.Can we just...hurry it up? I'm,uh,not a big fanof cemeteries. One too manyromero movies,huh? Uh,one too many funerals. That's crazy. Something's actually interferingwith the frequency. - Pull the batteries. - What? Pull the battery! Way to keepthings quiet. I guess I got a few more kinks to work out. Well,just see ifyou can get susan perkins' body to global dynamics withoutalerting the entire town. I'm going over there nowto meet allison. Batteries. Now,why didn'tI think of that? Welcome to global dynamics. Level-one clearance only.********* - So you metthe new director yet? - Not yet. He just arrived. Global dynamics is underD.A.R.P.A. Jurisdiction and they get a little crazyabout sharing information. - Hence,our visit. - What's D.A.R.P.A.? The defense advanced researchproject agency. It's the central research armof the D.O.D. Okay,so why am I here? Well,you want to usethe new molecular bioscanner on susan perkins' bodyand this new woman,right? Maybe. Yeah,well,all requeststo use laboratory resources for police applications must be submittedto the director of research. - Who we haven't met yet. - Exactly. Nathan? Allison. I swear I was just aboutto call you. What are you doing here?You're not-- - 'fraid so. - You're movingback to eureka? Moved,actually.Yesterday. Same office,same house. Surprise! I probably should've calledsooner. Probably. Must be the new sheriffI've heard so much about. - Nathan stark. - Jack carter. So you two used towork together? I mainly worked withher son,kevin.But,um, all I and ihad our moments. Anyway. Uh,I was looking into something and wanted to knowif I could use your,uh, bio,uh,scanner moleculethingy. Of course.

Just don't tell the sheriff thatI've got a spare bedroom,okay? Oh,my god. What?Did you see something? If you did,there's this formthat I gotta get you to sign-- no,it's our house. Wait,pull over. this is your house. I mean, susan perkins' house. But how did you know? Before walter and I split up, we were...planning to buildour dream home. This is it. It's exactly the same. I even picked that wallpaper. This is unreal. It's me,but... but it isn'T. This is their son? Hey,susan,maybethis isn't such a good idea. This can't be happening. Kevin... honey,five more minutesthen it's time for bed,okay? Five minutes.300 seconds. 7:30 P.M. How does he do that? Well,his brain just worksdifferently than other people. I miss my mom and dad. I know,honey. It's hard to losethe people you love. But it does get better. And the important thingto remember is that they loved youvery much. My mom dropped me at school. She said she'd be backto get me. But...she never came. I know she would've been thereif she could've. Okay? Tomorrow's gonna bea better day. freeze! Don't move. Evening,sheriff carter. Fargo. How...? I thought I locked the door. Uh,yeah,no.I-it doesn't work. Sheriff cobb always hadan open-door policy. Um,you might wantto be careful with this. It's a portable generator. So? Uh,a fission-poweredportable generator. Okay.Don't sleepon the nuclear-powered device. Good safety tip. Fargo,what do you want?It's 10:30 at night. Actually,I'm hereto help you. I heard you were lookingfor a place to stay, and,uh,I'm involved in a,uh, little project that I think you may find interesting. Really? What kind of project? Almost there. - Can I openmy eyes yet? - Okay. Behold the home of the future. Come on! ******** I'm going back to my cell. Oh,come on,sheriff.Just--just take a look. I know she's not muchfrom the outside,but I promise, once youget to know S.A.R.A.H.,You'll love her. Who's sarah? S.A.R.A.H.,Open door. Fargo,I don't knowif this is a good...idea. Lights.Moderate.

No.It's the smart house. A state-of-the-art model home, designed to anticipateits owner's every need and desire. Of course,it'll takesome time to learn all of your personalpreferences. Well,my preferenceright now is to have a house that isn't radioactive. Ha!Well,it used to be a nuclear disaster bunker,but don't worry. Rad levels are well withinnormal. Well,that's great. the telecommunications systemis linked directly to your office, and the skeleton profile has been programmedinto the mainframe. Your bathroom. Oh,fargo,you gottaget yourself a girlfriend. There's a 24-hour help line, if you run into any problems. S.A.R.A.H.,Door. I'll come check inon you tomorrow. Fargo.

Reow. I don't even knowhow to respond to that. Just a reminder: Susan perkins,bioscan,today,9:00 A.M. Uh,I thought thiswas the bathroom. It is,sheriff. Oh,well,see?Now you're just showing off. What's that? I have over 200 newspapers and magazines available if you'd like something to read. Good god,I may never leave! Uh,S.A.R.A.H.,Do you mind? Okay,ms. Perkins,we're ready for your bioscan. Okay,just hold still.This won't take long. I'm over here,jackass. Sorry.Here we go. so,this will tell us that the new susan is identical to the susan we buried? far more accurate than a dna test. - Allison. - Hi. You okay? Yeah,yeah. Nathan and i just got into it last night. And kevin had a nightmare. He did all these terrifyingghost drawings and-- you know,forget it.It's nothing. Okay. So kevin isn't stark's son? No. But you guysare still married? You're awfullycurious. I'm a cop,it's my nature. Look,nathan and iseparated last year. We just haven't gottendown to the final paperwork. - What's with the look? - There was no look. - There was a look. - None ofmy business. That's right. - you're not going to believe this. - Oh,they're bothsusan perkins. Down to the lastprotein chain. Chromosomes,celldifferentiation, I mean,all of the markersare identical. How did you know? I was reading walter'spersonnel file last night. Guess what the subjectof his first dissertation was. Stem cell replication. Are you saying that waltercloned his wife? Not exactly. Walter wentway beyond cloning. He re-created susancell by cell as a full-grown adult. I mean,she may look 30. Chronologically, those tissues can't be more thanseven years old,tops. A year older than her son?That's creepy. Ah,susan was right. Walter wanted a family,with her... or with her. memo to file. All section five projectsseem to be in order. First priority will beredoubling all security measures to avoid similar breachesin sec--urity in the future. Hello? Someone there? that's why you collapsed? An electrolyte imbalance? I'm just telling youwhat the doctors told me. And they have no ideawhat caused it. Yes,my electrolytesare out of balance. Oh,nathan. Don't worry,I'm fine. Who said I was worried? Wishful thinking. Yeah. Uh,susan perkinsis asking for you. Henry told herabout the whole "uber-clone" thing. I have to go deal with this. I don't thinkI'm going anywhere. Come on. Sheriff. Talk to you for a sec? Uh,sure.Yeah,okay. I'll catch up. Um,okay. How you doing,sheriff? Pretty good. Shouldn'tyou be staying in bed? Oh,no. I should begetting back to work. I didn't want to sayanything with allison still in the room. Oh,listen,I think you got the wrong impression. I saw something. Something I'd liketo keep between us. Oh. O-okay. There was an electricalproblem with the computers, and then I saw...something. A figure. Are you saying someonewas in your office? Not someone.Something. It wasn'tentirely corporeal. "Corporeal"? Physical. There and not thereat the same time. Are you saying you saw a ghost? Sheriff,the director ofresearch of the most advanced scientific facility inthe world doesn't see ghosts. No. - I'll check it out. - Thanks. So,you sleeping with her? Excuse me? You said I'd gottenthe wrong impression. I assumed you weretalking about my wife. - Not that I haveany right to ask-- - you're right,you don'T. You're not. But you'd like to. I'll let you knowif I get anywhere. With the ghost,I mean. Yeah. Tell me,henry.You're a scientist. Do you believe in ghosts? Well,I believe in energy.And when somebody dies, that energy has to go somewhere. So,theoretically,I suppose it's possible. Why? Topic's come upa few times. Where are wetaking her,anyway? Cryogenics. She's going to bethe focus of a lot of interest. Jeez. What's the mortality ratearound here? Twice the national average. The bigger the science,the bigger the risks. But,uh,none of theseare local. I have them shipped infor research. Hello? Hello,sheriff carter. It's S.A.R.A.H. Sorry,who's this? Your house. I'm,uh,waist-deepin bodies at the moment, so-- Sorry to bother you,but your wife abby called from los angeles. She wanted to let you know that your daughter zoe didn't come home last night. Ah,there's a shocker. She also said something about you shirking your responsibilities as a husband and a father. I recorded the conversation, if you'd like me to play it back for you. Uh,about the recordings,no more recordings. Uh,my private lifeisn't a reality show. Whatever you say,sheriff. - S.A.R.A.H.? - Yes,sheriff? Is there a camerain my bedroom? Certainly.I monitor all areas of the house for dr. Fargo's data collection. Would you like me to patch him in? Uh,no,no. I'll be seeing dr. Fargoin person later,thanks. Will you be home for dinner? I guess so. Wonderful. I'm making pot roast. Your favorite,right? Don't be late. Pretty mind-boggling,huh? Yeah. Henry,I needto see a geek about a ghost. Right this way. There is something very wrong with you people. Believe me,susan,no one knewwhat walter had done. I'm as surprised as you are. Oh,I seriously doubt that. Well,I thinkthe important thing now is to decidewhere you go from here. My ex-husband cloned me,moved her into our dream house,and had a child with her. Where I'm going is home, to put this insanity behind me. Yes! I am susan perkins. Back from the grave. Everyone take a good look. Uh,youfeel better now? Yeah.A little. so,listen. Your records haveall been cleared. You can moveanytime you want. I just wishthat you would-- I know whatyou're going to say. I appreciate the concern you have for that boy,really. But he's not mine,ms. Blake, and no amount of science is going to change that.I know,but-- my mind is made up.I need to go home. Fine. I'll drive youback to your car. Where's the video? fargo? I dumped all the videoin the trash. Please don't hit me. Where is it? - Carter. - What? What are you,amish? The computer. - Can you get it back? - Sure. Why? I need youto pull up the tape from yesterday. no problem. The surveillance cameras are on 24/7. Okay,"a,"that stops now. And,"b," pull upthe footage from my bedroom, from aroundthe time the power surged. If this goes on the internet,you're a dead man. What the hellis that? There was a power surgeat my house that screwed up the computers. Stark,beforehe blacked out,he said that his computers went haywire too and then he saw a figure. I'm--I'm betting that's it. I guess that answersyour question about ghosts. Okay.Freeze it there. That's weird. It disappeared. move it forward slowly. It's probably moving too fastfor our eyes to pick it up. There. Back. There's our ghost. - Is that whoI think it is? - Unreal. Now we just gottafind him again. and how are we supposed to do that? That remoteof yours,that's for scanningelectronic frequencies,right? - Yeah. - Do ghosts have frequencies? we're going to needa bigger battery. I thought you weretaking me back to my car. I told you.I can't do this. Susan,look,I-I know that this is a lot to handle. But like it or not,thereis a boy out there who is biologicallyyour child. You--you don't haveto get out of the car. You don't even haveto talk to him. But do you reallywant to walk away without evereven seeing him? there he is. I have a son,kevin. His father died rightbefore he was born. We don't getmany second chances. Okay. I've seen him.Can we go now? Really,ms. Blake,this is-- It's not me. Oh,my god. - what is that? - My son's nightmare. Get these kids out of here! Brian! Get out of here!Get out! Brian,get out! No! You stay the hellaway from him. Mom!You came back! just stay behind me,honey. And you,so help me,you-- walter? Walter,is that really you? Stop! susan,don't touch him! It's okay,walter.We're here to help. he,uh,doesn't seem to remember much before the accident. We may never knowexactly what happened. How convenient for him. I--I don't understand how this happened. Walter createda machine that caused a temporal implosion. When he tried to fix it,there was a cascading effect and he got caughtin the blast. That sounds like walter. Well,we all assumedthat he was dead. It turned out he'djust been shunted off into anothertime stream. Essentially stuckbetween seconds. This device should stabilize him. Why? I missed you. I missed you too,mom. I know you did. Can we allgo home now? So,what happens now? Temporalrehabilitation. What? Think physical therapy. But a whole lotmore expensive. Uh,I was talkingabout susan. Do you think she'sgoing to stay? For brian's sake,I hope so. Oh,wow. I thoughtmy family was dysfunctional. allison. Can you come hea moment? Um...I guess I'd better go. Oh,y-yeah. Yeah,I gotta fill outa report on this,anyway, and I still don't knowhow to spell "corporeal." C-o-r-p-o-r-e-a-L. Get some rest,huh? And,uh,tellyour husband I'm glad he'sfeeling better. carter. Carter,I sure am gladI caught you. There's somethingyou should probably-- - is it life-threatening? - Huh? Does it have anythingto do with,uh, a hole in time,or clones, - or it does it have globalconsequences? - Well,no,but-- okay,ah-ah! Then whatever it is,it can wait till tomorrow. You're the boss. That's right. I am the boss. Open the door! Due to technical difficulties, I cannot visually confirm identity at this time. Okay,okay.Listen to my voice. All right?It's me. Jack carter! I'm sorry,voice-recognition imprint is currently offline. And in the future,when someone says they'll be home for dinner and they're running late, it's polite to call. You're joking.You're mad at me? Sorry,but I'm not programmed for that emotion at this time. I'm gonna kill fargo. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I promise. S.A.R.A.H.,Uh, lights,fireplace,music. If you're hungry,I can reheat dinner. Oh,ju--no,just... you know,if I could justhave a moment to myself. I've been dealing with otherpeople's problems all day. And,you know,I'd really likea couple of minutes of peace. All you had to do was ask. Oh,yeah. Just a minute. I swear. If this is anothersusan perkins... Listen,I don't mean to be rude... hi,dad. You know? Your yardneeds a lot of work. Turns out it couldn'twait till tomorrow. Have a good nighT.
