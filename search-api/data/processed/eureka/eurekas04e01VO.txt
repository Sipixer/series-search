to an undergrad premed program at Harvard. I still can't believe our little girl is leaving home. This isn't how I pictured it going for us. Yeah, bad timing. Come here, Tess. A private funder is building a new, ultra large radio-telescope array, and they need someone to run it. And where is it? Australia. That's far. I don't have you here. But it's not just the distance, is it? I just don't know if I can do it anymore. Bye, Jack. Bye, Tess. Hey, Henry! Nice ride! Jack. A classic. 1947 Chrysler New Yorker. - Wow. - Isn't that something? Yeah. Sadly not mine, and at the moment not running. Where's your tow truck when you need it, huh? Yeah, if only there were two of me. Ah, don't tempt fate. Wow, engine parts I can actually name. Yeah, there's no fusion power cells in this one. I'm getting it ready for Founders' Day. Ah, right. Right. Come on, 60th anniversary. It's gonna be a big party. Yeah. No, I'm not in a party sort of mood. Oh, yeah? Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, no, Tess and I just... Oh, no, what happened? Oh, oh, don't worry. It's just, I think, a clogged fuel filter. Oh, well, it's no wonder. It's been sitting in the museum for the last decade. Well, you can't have Founders' Day without the founder's car, so I'll give you a hand. Great. Uh, uh, sheriff Jack Carter, this is, uh...I'm sorry. - Grace Monroe. - Grace Monroe. I was volunteered to organize Founders' Day. - That's a big job. - Oh, you have no idea, Sheriff. How... think I might just... [phone rings] Oh, yeah? - Allison. - Yeah, sure. - So we'll talk later. - Yeah. Hey. All right, so the filter's down there. [Marching band plays] Hey, Allison, what's up? Oh, oh, oh, my blood pressure. I need you to help me with logistics or Founders' Day is going to be the end of me. Yeah? Startin' to see why. Yeah, all this plus we're testing dozens of projects at Global Dynamics. Kevin started with a new rec therapist, and Jenna, she still hasn't slept through the whole night. You're trying to break mama's brain, aren't you? The joys of being a single working mother in charge of the most dangerous minds in the world. It's a scientific think tank, Carter, not an insane asylum. Yeah, tomato, "tomahto." Hey, guys. Cold war cappuccino? - No, no thank you. - No thanks. - Okay. - Thanks. So I heard about Tess. Oh, come on, that just happened. That just happened! I know, I called the house to talk to you, and S.A.R.A.H. answered. I'm sorry. - Thanks. - You okay? Um, yeah. Yeah, I mean, Zoe's coming home from Harvard after finals, and the house has been really quiet, so that'll be great. Oh, well, if you need noise, you can always come to my house. I'd be happy to take the kids if you need a break. No, no, no, that's okay. I actually finally found a nanny. - You... a nanny? - Mm-hmm. A nanny? What has a nanny got... What has a nanny got that I don't have? Yeah, like a PhD in early childhood development with an emphasis on organic nutrition? Lightweight. Yeah, even Kevin seems to like the guy, which is unusual with autism. He's usually uncomfortable with technology and people. Hey, baby, how you doing? You working hard? He sure is. These classics aren't gonna reassemble themselves. Nice stache! Thanks. Just showing my town spirit, sheriff. Founders' Day celebrates Albert Einstein's vision of building a creative haven for the world's greatest thinkers to live and create. Create havoc. Well, not all the time. I mean, these early inventions are a testament to that vision. What's this one do? That's a Van de Graaff generator. Turned way down in case someone's crazy enough to actually touch it. Look at my arm, look at my arm! What... oh... [chuckles] How old are you? All right, I'm gonna take Jenna back to the house. Fargo, he's all yours. Oh, I don't like the sound of that. All right, we're gonna need some traffic control, nighttime security for the science exhibits, and if you could put on a '40s era uniform, that'd be super. We strive for authenticity. Yeah, can I finish my run first? Um, sure. I'm not unreasonable. Oh, man, cold war cappuccino. This is gonna stain. Same Eureka, different day. Day's not over yet. Morning, Jo. Zane, what are you doing in my cell? Reminding you how we first met. Hmm. I got you something. Did you now? Hmm. Huh. And I suppose you'd like me to try this on for you? Something like that. Zane. Well, you already made an honest man of me. So let's make it official. Marry me, Jo Jo. Zane, I... I don't know what to say. How 'bout "yes"? Hey, Jo! Fargo's got a job for... No! [Laughs] Well, congratulations. Congratulations. Yeah, not so much. Um... Zane, I... Oh, Jo. Not right now, Carter. - Okay? - Sure. If you need anything, you just call. All right? Yeah. [Celphone rings] Jo? Jo, is that you? [Sighs] Oh, it's gonna be one of those days. Ah. Hey, Henry! Yeah, I... Oh! [Chuckles] Sorry, thought you were Henry Deacon. No, Dr. Trevor Grant. Nice to meet you, Trevor. Nice suit. You do Eureka proud. I prefer "Dr. Grant." And you are? Already sick of founders' day. Look, doc, could you give me a lift back into town? My phone's dead. I got some tree shrinkage to deal with. Sure, sport. Climb on in. Thanks. Looks nice, by the way. ...Smoke camels than any other cigarette.</i> This is Red Barber at Ebbet's field</i> where negro-league star Jackie Robinson</i> is making his major league baseball debut...</i> No way! As the Brooklyn Dodgers battle the Boston Braves.</i> Wow, you're taking founders' day to a whole new level. Come again? And here's the pitch from Johnny Sain.</i> Robinson swings. It's a ground ball to third, fielded by Elliot,</i> and Robinson is thrown out at first base.</i> Wow! What a career! He goes 0 for 3 in this game, and then six months later is rookie of the year.

I'll bet you do. Oh, wow, you guys go all out. What I wouldn't give to be unauthorized again, huh? Interesting perspective. So tell me, sheriff, you wouldn't happen to have a badge or a gun, would you? Yeah. They're back at my office. Good to know. Looks like we got ourselves an unauthorized visitor, boys. Major Ryan. Step out of the car. I don't have time for this. - Slowly. - Okay. Look, I'm all for a costume party, but I gotta get back to... town. This can't be real. That real enough for you? Cuff him. Sync by fant0m, corrected by gloriabg [groans] Rise and shine. Oh, yeah. Wait. You're... Whoa, whoa, whoa, just relax. Buddy, this is serious. You just assaulted an officer of the law. Do you understand that? Right, because you're the town sheriff. Yes. Of a town that doesn't exist. Nurse. Nurse. Excuse me, hey. Check out his head. I need him healthy enough to stand trial. Allison. I'm having the weirdest dream. I mean, the uniform's usually smaller. Carter, I don't think this is a dream. I think it's a dream. For the handcuffs. This is familiar. This is good. Carter, stop messing around. I need to get you out of here. [Radio announcer speaks indistinctly] He's awake. You get anything on him? He's not in any military or law enforcement personnel records. You figure out what that thing is? Beats me. Maybe a communication device. I've never seen technology so advanced. This is a serious security breach, Grant. I'm gonna have to call the General. And tell him what? Telegram for you, sir. That this intellectual community that you're proposing we build here has been infiltrated by a potential spy. We don't know that, Ryan. President Truman's meeting with Professor Einstein right now. Until he returns... And that's all she wrote, folks. Jackie Robinson goes 0 for 3 at bat in his first major league game, but the Brooklyn Dodgers still defeat the Boston Braves... Did he say Robinson went 0 for 3? Hey, did he say Robinson went 0 for 3? Told you he was overrated. Let's go speak to our town sheriff. Where is he? - I'll sound the alarm. - No, no. Don't sound the alarm. Lock down the base. We're about to celebrate the official sanctioning of this town. I want this kept quiet. So secure the base and find him without causing a panic, or the project will be over before it begins. Here, try this. You sure this isn't some kind of science geek ren fair thing? Well, either we're sharing the same delusion or we're stuck in 1947. Yeah, um, all right, so what were you doing exactly right before you came back here? Well, I mean, after I saw you, I went back to my car, and my phone died. And then I was in Casablanca. My phone went dead too. Well, maybe because of whatever it was that sent us here. Okay, um, what about the machine in the street, the thing that makes the hair stand up on your arm? No, Van de Graaff devices are electrostatic energy generators, not time machines. All right, well, maybe by themselves. What happens if you use it with an... and... What are you doing in here? Um, inventory. You and half the base. Save it for the dance. Out. Yeah. Not exactly mayberry, is it? Well, Eureka started out as a military base. The town wasn't officially founded until 1950. Well, how do we get back to our town and our time? - Well, I wish I knew. - Watch it, watch it. - What? - Watch it. It's the jackass who brought me in, Dr. Grant. We better not let him find you. If this is real, our presence here could change the course of future events. We have to keep a low profile. Okay. Is that Jo? [Alarm sounds] [Honks horn] So much for keeping a low profile. [Groaning] Okay, this is really bad. Yeah, for them. She's small but scrappy. [Grunts] Okay, I'll give her a hand. No, no, no, you can't! There's more soldiers coming. If you get arrested, we will never get out of here. We need a plan. We have a man trapped! I need help! Hang on! His foot's caught. Hang on, buddy. Got it. All right, come on. Okay, okay. He's not breathing. Carter, get out of here. - They're looking for you. - No. I can't leave him like this. Now go. I'll come back for you. Let's get this fire out! - What happened? - He stopped breathing. Is it any wonder with you bouncing on his chest like that? Hey, lay off, will you? No, stop, I'm giving him CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It's a new technique. I learned it in nursing school. You don't say. Oh, he doesn't have a pulse. I need a crash cart. Isn't crashing what did this to him in the first place? Electricity to jump start his heart. Soldier! Soldier, do you have jumper cables in that thing? Yes, ma'am. Okay, I need you to hook it up to the engine coil, ground it, then hand me the other end. - Now! - Don't look at me. She said now! I hope to God you know what you're doing. Me too. Back up. [Gasping] Oh, my chest is on fire. But you're alive to feel it. You're gonna be okay. Get you to the infirmary. Medic! I need a medic! Okay, okay. Wait a minute. Who are you? Allison. You learn that in nursing school too, Allison? Not exactly. As you were. We have the woman in custody. After she took down how many of your men, Ryan? Clearly she's been well-trained. She was carrying this. Look familiar? It's disabled, just like the others. Counting the guy in the stockade... That's three. That's three. Right. Nurse. Aren't you gonna stay with your patient? Of course. Hey, maybe you should focus a little less on the pretty nurse and more on the fact that we just had a major security breach. We still have no idea who these people are. Right now I'm more interested in where they came from. Keep searching, Ryan. Let's get this mess cleaned up! That the best you got? I was just getting warmed up. Where the hell am I? Jo? Is that you? Fargo? Oh, my... I thought I was gonna die alone. Fargo, why are you naked? Funny story. [Dramatic music plays] [Imitating Schwarzenegger] Your clothes. Give them to me now. Seriously? Fine. I was changing my costume when the phone rang, and then I was standing naked in the middle of a road surrounded by soldiers. Completely traumatizing. Not just for you. So what's your story? I was trying to reach Zane. He asked me to marry him. He what? [Casually] I mean... he what? He proposed. God, and I... I froze. What's happening to us? Based on the photos from Founders' Day, I'm, um, I'm pretty sure we're in 1947. I have no idea how to get back. What a bunch of hype Robinson turned out to be. Yeah, well, you know he's been under a lot of pressure, so... Oh, crap. You know, I wouldn't count him out just at the moment. Uh, you're all set here. Henry! [Clears throat] - You're here. - Yeah. Working. Hiding in plain sight. I mean, Eureka was always progressive, but nobody looks twice at a black mechanic still. Oh, man. Amazing, isn't it? You do realize that you, me, Allison, and Jo are all struck here. And Fargo, they caught him streaking through the camp. Of course they did. They're holding him with Jo, which is a shame because he loves swing and they're having a dance tonight. Henry, why are you not more concerned about this? I'm very concerned about this, but we have the opportunity to view Eureka before its founding, when a few visionaries changed the future. Well, until "a" we destroy that future, or "b" we get... Shot for treason. Okay, yes, there is a downside. Okay, so... How did we get here? I was working under the hood of that Chrysler with that woman, um... - Oh, Grace. - Right. And then my phone rang, and I was under the hood of that Jeep. My phone rang too, as did Allison's. They're all fried. So is mine, possibly an electromagnetic pulse. But whatever made this happen would have to put out a tremendous amount of negative energy in order to transfer matter in a closed time-like curve. Well, Tess was saying something about more solar flares than they'd seen in decades, putting out tons of negative energy, ironically right before she broke up with me. - It was, you know... - Sorry, Jack. Yeah. But I think she was right. That's not very supportive. No, I mean about the solar flares. They cycle every 11 years. The last peak of this magnitude was in the late 1940s. Well, that's it. I mean, that can't be a coincidence, can it? But still, it would take a massive satellite antenna to harness that kind of energy, and satellites haven't been invented yet. You sure about that? Yeah, last time I looked. Look again. Okay. Um, we need to go in there. Come on. [Coughing] Henry. Hello again. Oh, hello. How's the patient? Well, he's critical, but I think he's gonna make it. You know, I'm more of a physicist than physician, but from where I stood, you pulled off a minor miracle. Sometimes you just have to improvise. Improvise, I see. So tell me, Allison, how is it somebody with your... skills is, uh, is still only a nurse? So you think nurses are less valuable than doctors? No, ma'am. Just less appreciated. Look, we have a woman in custody. She needs her injuries treated, and there's this naked kid, needs some clothes. I would be happy to take a look. At the injuries, not the naked kid. Glad you clarified that. You keep searching. I want him found. Go! Major Ryan. I just found these hidden in the supply room. And this. Oh, wow! Well, do we know what we're looking for? I've seen this equation before. Yeah, and I've seen this before. This is the machine that Kevin was fiddling with on Main Street. Oh, my God! Is that good "Oh, my God" or... we're screwed "Oh, my God"? Well, if that transmitter's what I think it is, Kevin may have created a link, a network between us and the machine. Could he have used our cell phones? Well, they all rang before we were transported. They acted like beacons. Henry, could he have done this on purpose? I'm not sure, but I know who built this. Hey, sport. You boys want to tell me what you're doing in Dr. Einstein's lab? Okay, gents, start talking. Make it snappy. Okay. You remember me, Jack Carter. First-time caller, longtime fan. Uh, Henry Deacon, Dr. Grant. Wait, um... Trevor Grant? Yeah, he prefers "Doctor." He's kind of sensitive about it. - Do I know you? - No, but I know you. I mean, Einstein got all the press, but your work is critical to how we understand 21st century theoretical physics. Did you say my work and 21st century? We're not from around here. Well, not yet anyway. Einstein proposed that two points in time-space could be bridged with a lorentzian wormhole. Well, you helped build the Einstein-Grant bridge to test the theory. What, that? We were working on it for years. I've gotten close, but I've never been able to harness enough of the sun's energy to make it work. Well, maybe energy wasn't your problem. Jack, you saw Kevin with this same machine on Main Street. Maybe half an hour before we arrived. If he activated it in 2010 with the solar flares we were seeing, then maybe the machines created a link between the two times. Until then, you were building a bridge to nowhere. We built the other side. Do you seriously expect me to believe that you're from the future? I think you already believe, otherwise you would have called the MPs by now. That strange naked kid, that terrifying woman, they're with you. Fargo. That was Fargo and Jo Lupo, yes. And the nurse with the unorthodox training and the amazing gams. - Oh, easy on the gams. - Allison, yes? Whatever. You're all together. Well, we're all from the Eureka that you help create. Now we need your help to get us back. [Scoffs] If I can. The device is powered by solar flares. Satellite goes into eclipse just after 11:00 P.M. After that, bridge closed, ain't nobody going nowhere. [Loud knocking] Dr. Grant, it's Major Ryan. Open the door. 'Cause that's exactly the kinda day I'm having. Hide. I'm just on the phone with... Professor Einstein. [Knocking] I thought I said conduct the search quietly. Dr. Grant, we may have another spy. I found these and this. That means we have two in custody and another two on base. Any idea who these belong to? I'm narrowing the search. Listen to me, Ryan, I'm not entirely convinced these people are spies. - Really? - Really. I am. I'm gonna find them, prosecute them, and anyone who attempts to protect them. [Swing music playing] [Knocking] Dr. Grant asked me to check her injuries. Can you open the cell, please? You can treat her through the bars. She's surprisingly strong. She'll need to disrobe. Can we get some privacy, please? Sure. I could use a smoke anyway. Are you guys okay? Do we look okay? Well, I brought you some clothes. Thank God! Henry and Carter are here too. They went into the concrete bunker under the dish. Here. We're gonna get you guys outta here. What's that? Magnesium powder from the fireworks for the big swing dance on base. Really? I love swing dancing. Fargo, focus. The powder should burn hot enough to melt the lock. What about the MP? I'll distract him for as long as I can. All finished. So going to the dance? Okay, the lock is packed. Try not to burn the place down. That's it? This is gonna take forever. Can't we blow on it or something? No, but if we spray it with water, the hydrogen and oxygen atoms will split and intensify the heat. Yeah, well, we're in jail. Where are we supposed to get water from? Well, from us. Tell me you are not suggesting that I pee on the flame. Fine, I'll do it. But turn around. I can't go if you're watching. Hmm. My hero. [Screaming] It's hot! Oh, sparks! So hot. Ahh! Ah! Sparks! Hot! Hot! So hot! You hear that? It must be the dance. Well, the batteries are dead, but the computer chips are still good. This technology is astonishing. It's just astonishing. We've been developing prototype transistors for satellite communications. Where are they? Yes, yes. We may be able to adapt these to the telephones. Well, if we set them to the same frequency as the bridge device, we can set up a network. A network. Yes, exactly. So did you really set a satellite in orbit a decade before the world knew? Uh, yes, we did. It wasn't even that hard. Wow, you rule. But we still have a big problem. I got three people out there, and all the phones are in here. [Device powers down] Just lost the satellite link. Two big problems. Okay, listen, Sheriff. Yeah? You adjust the dial, ten degrees to the south. All right, where do I go? Perfect. Save me a dance. Nurse. How are they? Just some minor scrapes and bruises. She's getting dressed now. Just give her a few minutes. Good, good. Actually I came here to see you. A token of my appreciation for all your help. Thought maybe you could wear them at the dance. Thank you, sir, but that's not necessary. Where is he? He who? The guy the clerk saw you with in the supply closet where she found these. Carter. I have no idea. Stupid satellite. Stupid grant. Stupid 1947. [Groans] [Groans] [Buzzing] [Device powering up] Nice work, Jack. [Laughs] Suck on that, Founders' Day! Allison. Ryan has Allison. I'm going after her. How are the phones? Well, I've got two ready, I hope. Great. You hope? You'll never reach her without getting caught. I'll go with you. Wait, I can't do the others alone. Well, I can't help. I've gotta help him. Well, maybe we can help. Fargo, why are you on fire? I'd rather not talk about it. He stepped up. Allison helped us out. She said she saw you headed this way. Yeah, Ryan got her. Jo, I need you to guard the lab, make sure Henry and Fargo can work. - Done. - All right. And you're all from 2010? - Yeah. - Who's this guy? Dr. Trevor Grant. The Trevor Grant? Yes, I am, actually. [Whistles] We gotta go! Yes. We'll get to Allison as quickly as we can. But Henry, you have to turn on the beacons before 11:00 P.M. Or you'll all be stranded here. - Got it. - I wish I was coming with you. It's a real pleasure to meet you, Dr. Deacon. No, the honor is mine, Dr. Grant. - Don't break that. - That would suck. - Suck what? - Ah, forget it. [Swing music plays] - Here. - What? Better take my jacket. Here? Thanks. I hardly recognize you, sport. Seriously, don't call me "sport." Where are they? I told you, I don't know. That's convenient that they managed to escape right after you were here. Well, not so convenient for me. Oh, you think this is funny. Well, I think she's funny. And easy on the eyes. And one hell of a nurse. What are you doing here, Grant? Looking for someone to dance with. And you're not my type. Shall we, darling? Hey. You didn't really think I'd just let you walk out of here with you, did you? I did. You know, I did, but he didn't. Who? Him. Told you I'd be back. Carter. [Chuckles] - Here, take this. - What is it? It's your ticket home, sweetheart, if they don't catch us first. [alarm sounds] Ah, I think we got trouble. Henry needs time to finish the beacons. Quick, in there. It's easier to hide in a crowd. I'll try to buy you some time. - Go! - Okay. - Thank you for... - Don't thank me yet, doll. Go, go. [Swing music plays] - What now? - Now we dance. You dance? I know some stuff. Come on, Henry. [Song ends, applause] [Device humming] Almost there. [I'll be seeing you plays] * I'll be seeing you... * Can I have this dance? * in all the old familiar places * * that this heart. * Anytime, Henry. [Suspenseful music] It's time. [Phone hums] [Phone hums] Here we go. Okay, do you have your phone? Ah, I left it in the other jacket. You what? - Go, go. - No, no way. - You have Kevin and the baby. - And you have Zoe. We don't have time to argue. Well, you know what, maybe we don't have to argue. Hold my hands. Hold your hands? Hold my hands! Look, I would rather us be stuck here together than leave either one of us alone. * everything that's light and gay... * Just for luck. * always think of you * * that way. * * I'll find you * * in the morning sun, * * and when the night * * is new, * * I'll be looking at the moon, * * but I'll be seeing * * you... * - Carter! - Allison! Sorry, sorry. Allison. Allison. Hey, hey. - You okay? - I think so. How'd you know that was gonna work? I didn't. Well, thanks for keeping that to yourself. Thanks for the "just for luck." Hey! - Everybody's here. - You okay? Yeah. Can't believe it. Thanks for getting us home, Henry. Couldn't have done it without you. Hey, hey, guys! Great costumes. [laughs] Never thought I'd be relieved to see Founders' Day. - Mm-hmm. - And somehow everything - ...is just the same. - Yeah. Uh, almost everything. Archimedes used to be granite. - That's not granite. - No. Okay, wait, if that's different, other stuff could be too, right? Right. - I gotta go. - Okay. Zane. I can't believe you're still here. Where else would I be? I thought after the way that I reacted... I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. Maybe I was just thinking too much. You know, I... I do that sometimes and... Lupo, what the hell are you trying to say? I'm trying to say yes. Yes? Yeah. You'll ask Carter to let me off for good behavior? No, I... Yes, I will marry you. [Laughs] Me marry you? Mm-hmm. In what universe? [Chuckles] Henry, is that you? Hey. Hey. I just changed the oil and the fuel filter. She's all set to go. Oh, great. Ah. You okay? Sure. Fine, yeah. Uh, I just wanna shower and get changed and get ready for the festivities later today. - Uh-huh. - Yeah, I'll see you at home? - Yeah. - Okay. Don't forget this. Kevin, honey? Where are you? Kevin! Relax, mom, I'm right here. Uh, nice hat. Uh, I... Um, where's your sister? The "manny" is giving her a bottle. I'm going to Dre's house. He asked me to play Xbox, and I finished my homework. So can I go? What? Xbox, Dre's house, me. I'll be home before dinner. Thanks, mom. Love you S.A.R.A.H., are you there? Yes, Sheriff. S.A.R.A.H., is Zoe still at Harvard? Of course she is, Jack. Where else would she be? Look at you, handsome. [Giggles] Hi! I thought you'd never get here. Yeah, me neither. Can I get you a drink? Yes, please. Pardon me. Hi, wow, nice clothes. Vintage? Yeah, you might say that. I wonder if you
