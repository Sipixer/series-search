Isn't that what boyfriends are for? Miss! Can I get a... Can I get a warm-up over here... So you don't? Just being an attentive waitress. - Yeah, just don't be too attentive. - Helps me get tips. Not the kind of tips I want you getting. What's the matter? You don't like the food? No. It's... great. I just don't have much of an appetite. You thinking about Allison getting married to Stark? I am now. No, it's the Henry situation. I've sent him packages, but security won't let them through. You know, I can't think of anything worse than eating prison food for the rest of your life. I mean, other than being in prison for the rest of your life. Yeah. For me, it just doesn't seem right without him around. Feels like the whole town's out of balance. See what I mean? A hiring freeze is one thing, but cutting 75 jobs is quite another. We've got to start saving somewhere, Doctor. Start? You will decimate entire disciplines here at GD. Leaving everyone wondering who's gonna be next. Look, I came here to make GD a lean and commercially productive machine. It's what I do. Now, there are gonna be some changes here and in town. And while I appreciate the lively discourse, let's try to remember that while I'm here, I am the boss. Which is for how much longer again? Till I'm successful. And I do hope you're still here to see me go. So change means firing people, just so I have that straight. Not necessarily. Take a look at this. Look what Santa brought me. What is this? This is the new Global Dynamics consumer research products lab. And this is its new director. Zane? He's a risk taker with cross-discipline experience. Yeah, the words "Zane" and "discipline" tend not to go together in the same sentence. This place is gonna be awesome. Miss Thorne's giving me a blank check to hire anyone I want. Buy any equipment that I need. If we're cutting costs, how can we afford the startup on this? Corporate synergy, of course. If we come up with a hot product in here, maybe Miss Thorne won't have to make so many cutbacks. Research meets commerce. Perfect balance. Is this your card? No. Damn. This? No. So... I heard they're moving you to a different facility. Next week. A federal supermax in Colorado. I guess these walls aren't thick enough to hold a dangerous criminal like me. Tell you everyone says hi? - Vince. Zoe. - Yeah. Yeah, you did. Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks. You okay? Yeah. You know what... why don't you tell me about... the weather. Honestly, I am desperate for a sunset. Okay. 911. Allison. Right. Okay. I'll see about that sunset. Hey. Hi. - So where's the big emergency? - Lab 27. I'll show you. So how you been? Oh, great. Grea... Yeah. You? - Great. Really great. - Good. Is the... the wedding planning keeping you busy? Do you really want to know? The... So the... The 911 is... Missing person, he's been gone two days, a scientist in Lab 27 named Bob Nobb. Is it... It's really Bob Nobb? - He's... Did you check in his house? - He lives in the lab. You check under his cot? I'm afraid it's not that simple. It never is. So Lab 27's been in operation for 11 years. I've been director for two. And how long's Bob Nobb been involved? Since the beginning, of course. He have any favorite hangouts? Places he liked to go? - You didn't explain? - I was getting to that. Okay. Lab 27 is a sealed biosphere. A self-sustaing ecosystem designed to research and support the Mars missions. You do mean the potential Mars missions. Right. I mean, right. - How long has Bob been in there for? - 11 years. - 11 years? - Yeah. Well, along with nine other researchers. What kind of people do that? I think a life dedicated to science and sacrifice is quite noble. I actually applied to join the team myself. Well, congratulations. Well, I wasn't chosen, so... - That's why I'm congratulating you. - Carter. Yes, so, ten people in there for 11 years and no one's come - in and out in all that time? - No. No one. It's gonna be a walk in the park. Well, see for yourself. That's a big park. Season 3 Episode 02 What About Bob? (v 1.00) Teams Projet-SG & 6th-Race. So Lab 27 is a 12,000 acre, closed ecological system located a 1/2 mile below us. Inside is a 850-square meter lake, a savannah grassland, a rainforest where the human habitat is located. Okay, why build it underground? Control. Weather. Day/night simulation. Communications. Everything's generated and monitored from right here. And this billion dollar fishbowl produces what exactly? Priceless information about creating a balanced environment. You and I have a very different definition of priceless and balanced. I don't think now is the time to discuss budget. No. Why don't you guys duke it out while I go take a look inside. You can't go inside. Entering the lab is a total violation of protocol. But I have to find out if someone knows anything about the disappearance of Bob Nobb. I can't do that without talking to 'em. No, we... We have cameras, monitors. You can interview anyone you want - from right here. - It's not the same. - It'd be better if it was face to face. - I agree with you, Sheriff. I think you should enter the lab, and you should take Dr. Blake with you. What? Why? Because while you're doing your job, you can help justify why we're not filling in this giant money pit. - Hi. - Look up. Why'd you do that? So I can do this. And this. And this. Holographic tomography. It's generated by the nanoprobes I just injected into your system. It's from my lab. I have no pants. Funny you should mention that. So the chamber uses high intensity light</i> to remove any trace of bacteria from your skin</i> so you don't contaminate the lab. Is there any reason we had to do this together? Not really. No. Not the way I ever pictured us winding up naked. - You pictured us winding up naked? - No. Son of a... Forgot to warn you about the flash. I've never done this before. - I can't see. - Me either. - Clean suits are on your left. - Right. Wait. Hers or mine? Come on, Carter. Get it. - No, no. I'm pretty sure that's mine. - Right. Right. - Can you... - Yeah. Okay, I got 'em. Welcome to Lab 27. Unbelievable. Cutting GD's research is one thing. Putting our greatest human assets at risk is quite another. I had no idea you cared that much about Sheriff Carter. I'll run point on this. I know the lab. I know the protocols. I'm sure you have better things to do than stare at the monitors. You have no idea, Dr. Stark. Hourly reports. I have some business in town. All this is inside? Take a deep breath. What do you smell? Trees? A lake? Maybe some fertilizer. It's amazing, right, how real it seems? - Is it real? - Well, the animals and plants are. But the clouds and the breeze, the way day turns to night, all of it's created in the control room to maintain a balance in the system and make the lab seem more real for the residence. - How do they make it rain? - Recycled urine. That's lovely. It's amazing, actually. Everything here is. I'm Teri. This is my home. I've come to take you to the others. Just like old times, huh? You know it. You, me, a six-pack of Zima. Fargo, what are you doing? Hijacking the internal network of Lab 27. Bootleggin' the feed. That doesn't sound like something you should be doing. It's totally "not" something I should be doing. But it's Lab 27, mother of all reality shows. I hacked into it when I was an intern. It was like my barney. And what's your excuse? Fargo and I are viewing buddies. That's how we bonded. Okay. So what's so special about today? New characters. Hey, that's my dad! Everybody's pretty freaked out. Derek said this was all about Bob's disappearance. But some people are wondering if you coming inside means the end. - Would that be a bad thing? - Not if everyone wanted to leave, which they don't. Come here. I'm not sure, but I think some of these plant strains are extinct. That's Bob's garden. He was really proud of it. So he had a green thumb. What else can you tell us about him? No one liked him very much. Rick and Laura Wallace. We're team codirectors. Teri's parents. Allison Blake. This is Jack Carter. - Yeah, we know who you are, Dr. Blake. - Hi. - Abe Jensen, integrated systems. - Hi. We're here about your friend, Bob. Just because we live together doesn't mean we're friends. Abe, please. Well, I take it you've had some problems with Bob. Just seems he's always sticking it where it doesn't belong. Go ahead. Ask if anyone misses him. Okay. Does anyone Miss Bob? Not really. Any idea what might've happened to him? Are there any hazards around here I should know about? Abandoned wells, wood chippers, dangerous animals. No. No. No. No predators. We have a hard enough time as it is maintaining the balance down here without one lab animal eating the others. Teri? Over here! Over here! I think she just fainted. - Are you okay? What happened? - I'm okay. It went that way. It? - What is it? - It's Bob's uniform. What the hell was that? I don't know. But it went into that hole. No predators, huh? Hey, guys. What are we watching? My dad. We need to talk, Nathan. He's gonna be okay in there, right? Alli, I want you out of there. I'm fine, Nathan. Don't worry. Teri, are you okay? I'm okay, Derek. Really. I don't even know what I saw exactly. All right, tell me about the hole this thing climbed into.</i> It was... a slippery hole. And this was inside it. It's Bob's, and whatever left it got away. That's it. I'm initiating evacuation and shutdown scenario right now.</i> - Great. Where do we go? - Unfortunately, it's not that easy. After ten years, the residents immune systems have changed.</i> We can sterilize you to go in, but we can't sterilize the world</i> for them coming out. It's gonna take a transition facility. And that's gonna take time.</i> All right, in the meantime, can you tell us what this stuff is? We're uplinking the chemical components right now,</i> but it's gonna take some time for the results.</i> We'll try to get some of our own. My, how homey. Miss Thorne. What brings you here? This. I need your help on something. Institutional changes here in town that will put Eureka on a secure financial footing. Shouldn't this wait for Sheriff Carter? Sheriff Carter's got his hands full. Based on your record, I know that you're up to the challenge. - Well, thanks, but... - Credit where credit's due. No more free food at Café Diem. - Parking meter installation? - I'm afraid the free ride is over. Fees for library cards? Just the cards. The books are still free. Closing the museum. I didn't even know Eureka had a museum. My point exactly. Okay. Snake catching gear, huh? Well, we're a pretty resourceful bunch, but that's a test. - You guys even have snakes down here? - Over 20 varieties, but nothing more dangerous than your common garter snake. And no animal experiments that maybe got out of control? Sheriff, we're not the island of Dr. Moreau. Well, you're not an island. I don't know what they told you about our team, but we're not a bunch of amateurs. I mean, we take our research very seriously and it's a project that we really believe in. This... This is our moon shot. Even Teri's enthusiastic about the mission, and she's been down here since she was a kid. And what about Bob? You guys don't seem too enthusiastic about him. You sense that. Yeah. Well, that's his desk right over there. - What's his specialty? - Sustainable agriculture. And apparently women. That's your wife. Guy made a run at everything in a skirt. In the last couple of months, he seemed to take a shine to my daughter Teri. - Did that come up? You talk about that? - You bet I did. He denied it, of course. But I caught her a couple of times coming back from his garden all dreamy-eyed. Said she'd been "watching clouds". Just the thought of him trying something with her makes me... Yeah, well. Monofilament netting. Very high tensile strength. - This should be good. - So no dangerous animals. No crazy experiments. That leaves people. Could someone have engineered a predator and sicced it on him? Maybe somebody with a grudge? Sheriff, if I think of anything, I'll let you know. I miss you. - How you doin'? - I'm safe, I promise. I miss you too. How's Carter doin'? No, actually, Carter's doing fine. Of course, I would tell you if he wa... Carter. So you're not just here to take a look at the lab, but to keep an eye on me. No. Yes. - Assuming this is Stark's idea. - Not at all. - No. - Okay, Carter, it was my idea, okay? When Thorne brought out the chart with all the red dots showing how exciting things had gotten in town since you showed up, she was concerned. - And so were you. - Not about you. For you. - I'm trying to protect you, Carter. - What are you gonna protect me from? The prehistoric plants? - A giant, man-eating snake? - From Thorne. Not sure she's the one I'm worried about right now. My goodness. What did I miss? My dad hunting for the creature from the black lagoon. Admit, the injection of new talent has really made this show fresh again. So which one of the scientists is the red herring? Do you think the arrival of Sheriff Carter has made it more procedural? No, no, no. That was the switch up. Grace. Other than, obviously, Teri, you're the only other single woman down here, right? Actually, yeah. Nice of you to notice. Well, and did Bob Nobb notice? Well, of course. He and I were a bit of an item. Is that before or after Laura? Or the... The girl with the curly hair? - You saw his pictures. - Yes. Those were hard to miss. I was with Bob as long as anybody else. Three or four times, actually, over the years. Until it was time... to "rotate the crops", which... That's what he called it. Nice. Yeah. Always with the stupid agricultural euphemisms. Pretty stupid. I can't tell you the number of days I just wanted to just... - plough him under, you know? - And what's your specialty? Genetics. I really need to get back to work. Yeah. Carter, I just came in to call you. How'd you know?</i> I didn't. I just hit redial. Well, we got the results back on the substance on Bob's shoe.</i> We had to run 'em twice 'cause we couldn't believe it.</i> - So what's the verdict? - <i>Human.</i> - <i>Kind of.</i> - Human kind of? Oh, I'm gonna regret this. Carter, what is it? I can't watch. Help me. You're not ordering a lockdown. Did you see what they caught in there? The woman I'm going to marry is in there. For all you know, there could be a contagious mutation as well. You're not a scientist, you don't know what you're saying. What I do know is Dr. Blake and Sheriff Carter staying in there is both the safest course of action and the best way for us to find out what the hell is going on. And you know it too. I'm sorry. Why is it raining? I started it per schedule. Let's shut it off. No need to make the man more miserable. I could barely get the needle through his skin. What's happening to him? Loss of sebaceous glands. High keratin levels. There's a condition called Ichthyosis Vulgaris. Fish scale disease. I guess it could look like this, but... No disease would do this to his DNA. Not to the extent we're seeing.</i> - All right. Then what would? - <i>Atavism.</i> Evolution in reverse. Explain. 90% of our DNA is believed to be dormant, left over from when we all shared common ancestors. Atavism is the reappearance of traces that have disappeared. Hind legs on whales. Vestigial tails on babies.</i> Or snake parts on Bob Nobb? Apparently. We all carry genes that are identical to those in fish, birds, reptiles,</i> - <i>but that DNA's believed to be dormant.</i> - Until now. All right. Assuming we go with that. How would it happen? Closed environment down there. The ecosystem must've gotten knocked out and just continued to self-reinforce.</i> Okay. Is there a specialist up there we can talk to? Yeah. I know just the guy. Worked on the shuttle team.</i> Developed their life support system. And genetics is one of his sub-specialties.</i> I've told you nobody else is entering the lab.</i> Well, it doesn't matter. That person is Henry. We're on our own. Not necessarily. I'm not forgetting what you did at GD. That's a conversation for another day. I'm gonna set that aside right now because Global needs your help. I don't see how I can provide that. As much as I hate to admit it, Sheriff Carter had an idea. Look, I just wanted to apologize for earlier. - Forget it. - Look, with everything goin' on at Global and Thorne showin' up, some days I don't know if I'm comin' or goin'. Literally. No worries. I can relate. And I know you don't need me to protect you from prehistoric plants. No. But if you could teach me about self-contained biosystems, that would be great. Well, maybe I could help you with that. Oh, now that's what I call a switch up! Henry, how are... Hologram. I thought of the one that Zane made of me and I'm just glad you have pants. Next screen. Will this tell us what's changing Bob? Maybe, if it's part of the ecosystem, which I find doubtful. - Is that diagnostic run complete? - Bringing it up. - Why that? - If the system was contaminated enough to do what it did to Bob, people would've gotten sick years ago. What if the contaminate wasn't in the system years ago? Carter, it's a closed system. People keep saying that, but we're here. - That's not right. - What? The water. The ionization levels are way off. - Ion... Io... C... Could that... - Alter DNA? Absolutely. Ionization of the water produces free radicals which can target accelerated mutations. So Bob's being changed into a snake by the water? It may not be isolated to just Bob. Well, no. With recycling... It's... It's the rain? Can we reverse it? We can purge the system, but we can't reverse the changes that are already underway. Sheriff Carter? Could you look under my shirt? Please. It's happening to the others too. So the two of us? I'd say it's just a matter of time. It was the water, all right. Something or someone changed it. What you guys are witnessing is the first ever demonstrated case</i> of macro de-evolution. Can you see the variation in the mutations? Yes, and whatever it is, it's affecting the entire genome.</i> How long does it take to affect the genome? I jury-rigged a timeline and up until a week ago, the water was clean. Looking at the physical progressions, I would say that's an outside limit. Look, Zane and I are gonna get back into the genetics. You guys just hang tight. We'll fix this. Look... I understand... Really only a little of what you guys are saying, but wouldn't it be easier to reverse if we knew what caused it? Sure. But how? I'm still not sure that backing up on the sedatives is a good idea. We have no idea how strong he is. We need to talk to him. If he's still in there. Hey there, pretty lady. And apparently, he is. What happened? The water system in the lab is mutating people's DNA. We need to know who did this to you so that we can stop it. Bob, why would you have been a target? Everybody likes me. Look, why would the water affect you before everyone else? I was just watering my garden. - Oh, my God. - The de-evolution is accelerating. I'm not sure how much longer the human side is gonna remain dominant. And when it isn't? That. Okay, what are we gonna do now? We go back to where it started. Things were just starting to die this morning. Yeah, it's like the whole garden's been torched. The water that affected Bob, can it affect plants? - Sure. - That's how it affected everyone else. It went from Bob to the plants to the others. That still doesn't tell us how it got to the water in the first place. Yeah, but this dead area, that's a perfect circle. You said the ionization levels were off. - Could the sun cause that? - There is no sun. Light is artificial. The spectrum could've changed from something natural to something containg mutagenic wavelengths. So this could've been intentional. Like frying an ant under a magnifying glass. Beautiful clouds. I miss you so much. Ever since the Sheriff showed up, it's been so hard to talk to you. Well, it's not gonna get any easier now. I don't understand. Derek can explain. Can't you? I never meant to hurt anybody. Derek and Teri had a long-distance thing going on. No, I heard her talking to Bob about... About the clouds. Yeah, but you didn't see Bob, did you? She was talking to me on the garden phone.</i> Yeah, a lot. I checked the log. I saw the way Bob looked at Teri. I didn't want her to get hurt.</i> But you hurt everyone else. I didn't realize that the sun would affect the water supply. I just...</i> I figured if Bob got sick, he'd have to leave the lab.</i> And when he got better, he wouldn't be able to come back.</i> You did all that for me? I love you, Teri. And we've never even been able to hold hands.</i> We had no idea you were so unhappy. - I wasn't. I'm not. - We would've left. - We would've closed all of this up. - But I didn't want you to. I didn't wanna be the reason that you lost the thing you loved. Oh, honey. So Rick and Grace were the red herrings! I so did not see that coming. This is the best season yet. Just coffee. And that'll be $25. Better start a tab. I may want to have some half and half. Enjoying the local color? I am. Observing the nuance of your fine town. - You? - I just came in to wash my hands. Is the water still free? And yours is on the house. Efficiency has its own elegance, Deputy Lupo. Balancing a town, a company, a life. There's a certain beauty to it. Well, I will be sure to tell that to the museum curator that I just sent packing. I know today was difficult, but sometimes you have to sacrifice a part for the good of the whole. So you're... You're saying that one day we'll thank you. You might. I'm not your normal corporate fixer, you know. Yeah, and... Eureka is not your normal town. We've got our own balance. And you're messing with it. You look anxious to get outta here. This place is freakin' me out. Lookin' forward to getting back to some real sunshine, some fresh air. - Yeah. Sorry. - Forget it. How long to get a fix on this mutation? We have targeted all the processes that need to be reversed, but it might take us a few days to figure out the treatment. Few days? That's all it took for Bob to turn from pa... He's taken Allison. We may not even have minutes. - What happened? - We lost the feed. I found Bob's trail. It's fresh. He doesn't have much of a head start. I'll make sure the wind's against you so he can't pick up your scent.</i> - Good. I'm heading out. - And I'm heading in. No, we need you on this end. We're close to reverse the gene. But the delivery system's killing us. - It's gonna have to wait till later. - They're changing down there. You saw Bob. Look, they hit a point of no return, it won't matter if we get them out. - Only thing that's gonna stop me is... - <i>A gun.</i> That's a little extreme. No. Your... Your gun thingy. The biosensor you used on Allison and me.</i> - Bioballistic particle delivery system. - Yes. - We could modify it. Longer range. - Larger bore, heavier payload. The timesink's gonna be fabrication. Unless... I need a gun. A big powerful gun. I've been waiting for someone to say that to me my whole life. Why would Bob take Allison? If we're talking about the human Bob, he may think that she can help him. - No, the... The other. Snake Bob. - Well, reptiles aren't exactly complex. Their needs are basic. You mean, like food. Fantastic. I thought you could use a hunting buddy. What part of hourly reports does Stark not understand? He got anxious. The transition facility is nearly complete. The tactical team that he ordered without authorization - is gonna be ready in ten minutes. - We're not gonna need it. How do you know that? Carter, Henry, and Stark. That's your money team. They know exactly what they're doing. You sure you know what you're doing? I have no idea. So I just shoot him, right? Bullet's an organic plastic covered in plasma DNA. It should reverse the de-evolution. Let's do this thing. Takes it a second to warm up. - You could've told me. - Guys. Sorry. I came as fast as I could. - What's she doing here? - I'm just glad she agreed. It's me. Teri. Bob likes Teri. In fact, she's the only woman down here that he hasn't... So you're trading Teri for Allison? Sorta. Thank you. Guys, it's Zane. They saved Allison. Everybody is fine! I told you he'd be okay. What do you say we just turn off the TV and read a book? - Told you they'd pull it off. - Well, don't sell yourself short. The redesign on that gun was inspired. - Well, we all do our part. - I know you do. Talk to me about Henry Deacon. How you feelin'? Okay, I guess. Gettin' shot kinda hurt. If you want to avoid that in the future, you might wanna be a little nicer to the ladies. Point taken, Sheriff. Learned my lesson. And if there's any way I could repay you... - Once a snake... - Always a snake. - I just want to say thanks. - Glad we could help. Is Derek going to jail? That's not up to me. I'd like to see him. Would mean you'd have to leave the lab. Actually, we're thinking that's not such a bad idea. It's hard enough for a kid to find their place in the world. Especially when they've only been to one place. 'Scuse us. Henry, there's something you need to see. We couldn't have done it without you. Technically, you did. It's not gonna be the same when you're gone. Not by a long shot. Thanks. For the sunset. - How you feelin'? - Much better. Thank you for keeping me from turning into a snake - or being eaten by one. - My pleasure. You know, that organic plastic we used with the delivery system? It's developed down in Lab 27. Discoveries come from where we least expect them. Yeah, well, I'll tell Thorne that when she wants to shut the lab down. Already did. Hey, I thought your shift was over hours ago. Can't a girl bring her dad a burger after a hard day's work? Sure. I was really worried about you. Thanks. I was... I was worried about you too. Why, Josefina, I'm touched. Don't get used to it. - Good to see Henry. - Yeah. Yeah, it was. No, it's... it's good to see Henry. I don't know how to thank you for my pardon. I'm sure it wasn't easy. You're right. It wasn't. I hope it's worth it. If you're bringing Henry back, the least I can do is buy you a beer 'cause they now charge for food around here. That's all back to the way it belongs as well. Balance restored. Besides, single malt's more my style. Your secret's safe with me. Good to know. - Good night, gentlemen. - Good night. Just had to check. Listen, I'm not even sure I should've come back. Of course you should. You're home.
