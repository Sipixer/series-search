You're the new head of Section Five? Look, Duncan, how well do we really know each other? You know, our hopes, our dreams, our reactions to surprises? I think I'm gonna have to think about this. You and Henry are working on something. It's a signal, isn't it? You're gonna need all the help you can get. Henry, what are you saying? There's something out there. It's heading straight for us. Straight for Eureka. What's all this? We're making a baby book for the boys. - Smile, uncle Jack. - Thanks for that. SARAH, print. I'd be happy to maintain a virtual album</i> with holographic growth charts and captured sound.</i> That's okay, SARAH. Some things are better the old fashioned way. - So any word from Duncan? - Dad. What? No, it's okay, Zoe. He's probably halfway across the world curing disease where he belongs. Which is why I didn't tell him I was pregnant to begin with. I'm sorry, aunt Lex. I really didn't mean to pressure you. I thought you would work it out. No, Zoe, it's not your fault. Life is... It's messy sometimes. - Is it? - Here we go. So everything's my fault? No, not everything. Look, Jack, even when we were kids, you never took my side. Lex, cut the guy some slack. You lied to him, then you took off. He didn't have the chance to do the right thing. Life is messy. But this isn't how you clean it up. He doesn't want this. I do. So I'm moving on. I got to get dressed. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Moving on. - So what's this all about? - Just waiting for the aliens to land. Seriously? Actually, it's our turn to host 'cause we went there last year. Um, "there" being... Area 51, Eureka's arch rivals. Our annual bowling match goes back nearly 50 years. - Bowling. That sounds pretty intense. - You have no idea. Area 51, - that's UFO guys, right? - Wrong. They got the alien rep after a surveillance balloon crashed in 1947. - Never lived it down. - Which is why we love to rub it in. Totally throws off their game. Hello, Fargo. Hello, Bismark. What is that odor? - The smell of fear. - The only thing scary is your breath. Ready to lose for the fifth year? Did you bring your green men to help you? I'll show you green men. Easy, ladies. Keep the competition friendly, okay? It's hardly a competition, Sheriff. Your little team doesn't stand a chance. You haven't met our secret weapon. Hey, Big Ed, come out and say hi. Big Ed Fowler? The former PBA champion? He also happens to be a very gifted biochemist. Bowling's more of a hobby. There's no way. This is a violation of the rules. You can't bring in a ringer from the outside. Rules state anybody employed here can play. Read 'em and weep. Still time to beam back to the mother ship. - Bring it, Fargo. - It's been brung, Bismark. - Nice English. - Nice face. All right, stop. I gotta go. But both of you... behave. Finally. - What did you come by, pack mule? - Nice to see you too, Tess. Sorry, but time-sensitive issue. We need your help collecting all the globidium in Eureka. All the what? Globidium... It's a nuclear element artificially created here at Global. It's much safer than plutonium with ten times the energy output. Why the recall? Globidium's been field tested in town for years, but we need to get it back for a new project. Not everyone is complying. And we were hoping you could persuade them using your inimitable Andy Griffith charm. You have the unique ability to make a compliment sound insulting. - Who said that was a compliment? - Stop. I really need your help, Carter. In the meantime, it's artificial. Can't you make some more? We could if we had six months. But we don't. We need to move quickly. This has something to do with the signal from space? You told him? No, but you just did. You think you're clever. Yes, I am. So when are the little green men coming to Eureka? Sorry. I can't share the details. We shared an alternate universe. Does that not mean anything to you? - Just get to that list, Sheriff. - All right. I'm on this list. The smart house reactor runs on globidium, we'll need yours too. Is that a problem? SARAH might have an issue with it. You don't have to worry about SARAH. She can be adapted to alternate sources. She doesn't like change, and neither do I. I noticed. Meaning? Tess Fontana. I mean, she gets under your skin. Yeah, just a bit. I think our first customer is trying to make a fast getaway. Clean globidium-mobile! I'll return the power cell tomorrow. I got a hot date tonight. She loves the car. She's just gotta love you for you. Pop the hood, Henry. I just had this cleaned inside and out. You can eat off that engine. It's not here. The reactor's empty. Seth, give it back. I'm the victim. Then why were you trying to get away? In a car with no power cell. How dumb do you think I am? What the hell? Strike one! You know the rules. You mess with your own balls. But not with ours. Somebody can't take a joke. Fargo, I have one word for you. Is it "surrender"? It's "truce". We're above this pettiness. So I'm gonna be the bigger man here and propose that we focus on the game. No more pranks. Deal? Deal. May the best team win. As long as they're human. Good one. - We're really calling a truce? - No way! I just want to keep them off their guard. That way they'll never know what hit 'em, huh? What the frack? His car was in the driveway all night. Anyone could have taken the power cell. Yes, but globidium is a unique power source without it, our project won't be ready in time. What project is that exactly? The point is we need to find it. Do we need to be worried about health risks? Compared to elements like plutonium, no. But if it is taken out of the container, then we'd be looking at moderate levels of... Radioactivity. Now, that's odd. It's picking up a radioactive source... from somewhere. We demand action. I think they're taking the little green men thing a bit far. This is no joke. They're radioactive. Projet-SG (1.00) Those guys are crazy. They're trying to kill us. You're gonna be fine. - They're gonna be fine, aren't they? - Yeah. You have elevated levels of gamma radiation that mutated the pigmentation of your skin, but it's the equivalent of a sunburn. So we're not gonna turn into The Hulk? Only if you get really, really angry. Don't worry. It'll be out of your system in a few days. Then we need to get back to practice. We need to get even. Fargo smash! Fargo will not smash. There'll be no getting even. Understand? - That's actually a pretty color. - Yeah, if you're a muppet. What could have caused this? Could it be a missing power cell courtesy of Area 51? On its own, no. But if it was altered, it's possible. I've worked with these guys before. They're dorks but harmless. We still need to collect the remaing power cells. - You go with Jo, I check out Bismark? - Let's go. Don't be afraid to use deadly force. There's a visitor at the door. Maybe it's the baby's crib. SARAH, you can open the door. Hello, Lex. This is the Duncan? Yeah, this is... him. - What is that? - It's my house. It's... - Possessed. - <i>Of a singular artificial intelligence.</i> SARAH, please. I thought you left town. - I prefer to deal with my problems. - We're nobody's problems. Don't turn this around on me, okay? You are the one who took off without saying a word. You freaked out when I told you. It's 'cause of the way you sprang it on me. I mean, kapow! Lookie here! Twins! Right out of thin air! All right, you're right. So maybe I panicked a little. A little? So you would have reacted differently had I told you in Cape Town? Maybe. The point is I had a right to know. You're right. You did. So what do you wanna do now? What do you wanna do? I want us to be honest with each other. I mean, come on. We had six... crazy, passionate months together. But this wasn't in the cards. Life looks different to me now. I'd give up anything for these kids, but I don't expect you to. Isn't that my choice? Go back to your life, Duncan. Please? That's what you really want? You heard the lady. Yeah, there you go! Just picture Fargo's face on the pins. Works every time. Bismark! Well, hello, Sheriff. How's Fargo? Green with envy or just plain green? What'd you do? How'd you do it? Camoscope. The future of camouflage. It emits gamma rays into the skin, starting a chain reaction that alters the pigmentation. Any chance you powered it with a stolen bit of glob... It's a nuclear power cell thingy. We don't steal. We win. You're taking the prank thing a little far, don't you think? As far as turning a beloved mascot invisible or planting a bioengineered laxative in a rival's talcum powder? Why would you do that? You guys did that... Last year in Area 51. Look, if you really wanna find your nuclear power cell thingy, Sheriff, you might wanna talk to your own team members, 'cause they're the ones that take things too far. For you. - You're Lexi's niece, right? - Yeah, Zoe. You know, your aunt can be unbelievably stubborn. And overprotective. It runs in the family. What's with the green man group? My boyfriend's team got punk'd by their rivals. It's probably gamma radiation. I saw something similar near a reactor in Siberia. The green's a nice touch. You know how to fix it? Lucky for you, a good epidemiologist always travels prepared. Vinspresso ice cream, anyone? Vincent, we don't need ice cream. We need payback. Oh, my. What are you, green and deaf? - I said no payback. - Of course, Sheriff. We'll take the high road. - It's a good idea. - Stop sucking up, Lucas. Are you planning any pranks involving a nuclear power cell? We've dabbled in low-combustion explosives, but nothing nuclear. Lucas, what part of "secret" don't you understand? You almost done with Tess's list? Yeah, and Seth Osbourne's not the only one missing a power cell. - We have three more thefts. - Of course we do. Can I offer you two some ice cream before it all melts? - No, thank you. - What's the problem? My freezer died right after Area 51 showed up. Coincidence? I think not. Well, don't be too sure. Is Café Diem on the list? The freezer runs off globidium. And it was working when Big Ed cleaned it this morning. Now... Seth Osbourne said that he had his car cleaned as well. Would Big Ed happen to work in the auto detailing business? Well, sure, Big Ed can clean anything. I mean, that's his job. He's the cleaner. That's it. All the globidium cells we've managed to collect. Well, the laser telescope is gonna need a lot more power if we're gonna get a good look at that... Whatever it is. - Is that what's sending the signal? - Yeah, it's the best image we can get. The new telescope will give us a much higher resolution. But our atmospheric window closes in 24 hours. Well, Carter will find the stolen power cells. Just give him some time. Is there anything, you know, going on between you two? What? God, no. I'm pregnant. You know, some guys are into that. More of you to love. Okay, stop. We're friends. Just friends. If you say so. Okay, thanks, Principal Wallace. We'll let you know when we find it. Let me guess. She had Big Ed clean something? Globidium-powered barbecue that's now missing a power cell. Looks like the cleaner's dirty. Well, maybe we'll get lucky and he'll confess. It's just down here. I guess he stepped out. Or took off. The missing power cells. Should we be worried about, you know, radiation exposure? Well, I gotta... I'm gonna say yes. Is that Big Ed? Not anymore. No radiation. It's all good. - Tell that to Big Ed. - So he just melted? Like a green popsicle on a sunny day. At least you found the globidium. Well, globidium couldn't do this on its own. Could it react to the stuff that turned him green? Well, if the combo generated the right amount of radiation, it could mutate human cells. - We need to talk to Henry. - All right. Theoretically, it's possible... Except for one problem. These containers? They're empty. What happened to the globidium? I don't know. I mean, there's not a single photon in any of them. As a matter of fact, there's a total absence of radiation in Big Ed's remains. - Well, that's disturbing. - Well, he's a big puddle of goo. No, no, Carter, I mean on average, we're all exposed to .2 rem of radiation each year, which means, to some degree, we're all radioactive. - Well, that's comforting. - No, it's normal and generally safe. Though neither of those words seem to apply here. You get used to that. If Big Ed was turned green by radiation, shouldn't his levels be even higher? One would expect, but... It's like something drained it out. - What about the rest of the team? - They've been tested. Everyone's fine. Let's get 'em back and check their radiation levels just to be safe. You threatened my team and liquefied our secret weapon! This is blasphemy, okay? Madness! This is Eureka! Break it up. What happened? I have no idea, okay? But we didn't do it. You did turn them green. I told you. We fully tested the camoscope. The effects are completely superficial. Did you do anything else to Big Ed? Any pranks, any other... When? We've been practicing all day. Ask anyone. They'll tell you. You probably been using alien mind control on everybody here. - Bite me, Kermit. - Guys! A man's dead, okay? Now, I need help. You got it? - Got it. - Got it. Great. Fargo, you knew Big Ed. Any reason that he'd want to stockpile a bunch of globibidum? - Globidium. - Don't push me. I don't know. He usually kept to himself. I know he liked to clean. And I think he had a pet. You want to keep Area 51 here until further notice? Fargo, get your guys to GD, just in case. Like, in case we melt? As long as you're green, I'd like to keep an eye on you. I'll watch them. Come on. And remember, no more pranks, okay? Last one, I swear. What's in that stuff? It reeks. Tell me about it. It's an organic mineral mask made of herbs, sea salt and fruit extractions from around the world. Should leach the toxins out of the skin. I feel like a girl. Would you rather stay green? Yeah, I didn't think so. I'll be right back. - Smoothie. - Sure. - Can we get Lexi's special? - Aunt Lex. What's up? I just came to get a smoothie before yoga with Allison. What's Duncan doing here? He's taking pity on my green boyfriend. I hope that's okay. Yeah, why wouldn't it be? Because I'm fraternizing with the enemy for my purposes. No, Duncan isn't the enemy. Besides, he's really good at what he does. I should go meet Allison. - There you go. - Thank you. And a decaf Vinspresso ice cream. It's for Allison. She's craving it. Thanks. Let's see what we got. Well? Duncan, you're a genius. Can we fix the rest of me now? It's not just you. How much of this stuff can we make? So... Why would a cleaner wanna steal globidium? Big Ed wasn't just a cleaner. He was the cleaner. Clean rooms, contamination control, waste management... They're all essential to the research that we do here at Global. I heard a single dust mite once got into LEP at CERN set them back six months. So if dirty is bad, then would Ed have stolen the cells to power like a nuclear vacuum? What Tess means is that we have moved well beyond that. Big Ed specialized in bioremediation, using microorganisms to restore a contaminated environment back to its natural state. So kinda like soap? What? Each organism was created to clean a particular metal or chemical, which makes it perfect for cleaning up industrial waste, oil spills, and the like. Well, Big Ed's remains were cleaned of radiation. Could he have had an organism that did that? All right, everyone. You need to apply the treatment wherever you're green. So... take off your clothes. Get naked here? All right. You heard him. You with me. Boys with Duncan. Relax, Doug. Nudity is perfectly natural, all right? I lived in places in Africa where it's the custom to go au naturel. Bully for you. I prefer privacy. Here it is. Big Ed bioengineered a prototype for a microorganism that ingests gamma radiation for nuclear waste cleanups. He even gave it a nickname. "Spot". As in "remover", I'm guessing. Fargo said that big Ed had a pet. Yeah, but all I see here are cleaning supplies. And when I went by his house, he didn't have any food dishes or litter boxes. But could this pet project be his pet? Well, if it is, pets need to be fed. - Wanna guess what his favorite food is? - Globidium. - No wonder he's so far over budget. - He used my power cells as pet food? With you collecting it all, it was either that or let it starve. And if he ran out, Spot might be after other sources of gamma radiation. Like a green Big Ed? Where is this thing now? - Looking for its next meal. - In here? Well, it's not like it just can open up a door. There's another way out. Man, this stuff stinks. What is in this stuff? Get off me! Go, go, go! What was that? I may never shower again. I'd rather go naked than wear fur. Yes, General. I understand your concern about the signal. - Hey, you ready? - Yeah, one second. Yes, sir. I will schedule a call. Hey, partner. I got you a little present from Vincent. It's ice cream. It's a little melted. I am so sorry. I am going to have to cancel yoga today. I have a situation that I have to deal with. I guess I'll just see you next time. Come on. You okay? Duncan's in town. Yes, I know. I met him. He's helping un-green our bowling team. Yeah, he's good that way. He's good most ways, actually. Too good. You make that sound like a bad thing. I just... I don't want him to change because of me... Or them. Oh, well, I'm not gonna lie to you. Children definitely change things, but mostly for the better. - You ever have any regrets? - Oh, about having them? I mean, it's hard running this place and being a parent. But is it worth it? Absolutely. My only regret is that Nathan... isn't here to share it with me. I closed the valves on the main line. That should keep it in the building. But if it went down the drain, what's to stop it from coming back up? Well, I think I scared it, actually. I mean, when I came in, it jumped off Fargo in a hurry. Trust me, you're not that intimidating. And single-celled microorganisms don't get scared. It wasn't so micro, and it was green. Can't be a coincidence. It might have reacted with the gamma radiation in big Ed and mutated, but you know what? I'm not detecting any radiation signature. Well, that makes it tough to track. Well, maybe instead of going after it, we bring it to us. - With what? - Bait. Hey, I heard what you did for the team. Always helping people wherever you go. Listen, can we talk? - There's nothing left to say. - Lexi, why are you pushing me away? Because there are plenty of people out there for you to save. - I'm not one of them. - I never thought you were. If anything, you saved me. I'm sorry. I'm late for class. Bye. We can't afford to lose any more globidium. What we can't afford to lose is researchers. Oh, thanks. Way to make me look selfish. What we need is a sample large enough to lure spot out before he finds another food source, - and when he comes out to eat... - We capture him. Done and done. Famous last words. You have a better idea? You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? Part of my Andy Griffith charm. Oh, my God. What happened to all my globidium? Oh, God. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that. I think Spot's found another food source. Come on. We're gonna need a bigger container. - We gotta contain it to Section Five. - The entire level is locked down. - That won't help if it's traveling. - At least it's trapped in the building. For the moment... but you saw that door. It could pop up anywhere. It gets bigger, it needs more radiation. We need to secure any potential sources. I'll start to evacuate. Well, judging by its size, it'll eat just about anything. Did you just look at me when you said that? I wo... ice cream. I was looking at the ice cream. Ice. Cold. When Fargo was in the shower, he bumped into the faucet. I thought I scared it, but maybe it doesn't like the cold. - So what are you proposing? - That we freeze it in its tracks. Hey, it's the miracle worker. Thanks so much for taking care of Lucas. Our prom pictures would have sucked. My pleasure. Can I get a large coffee to go? I've got a long drive ahead of me. Wait. You're leaving? Your aunt's made it perfectly clear she doesn't want me here. So you travel halfway across the world to see her, and then you just give up? I can't make her talk to me. You can talk to her. I've tried, Zoe. She won't listen. Well, try again. Look, Carter women are complicated and stubborn and slightly crazy. But we're definitely worth the fight. She doesn't want me to fight anymore, Zoe. So I'm going home. Can I have my coffee, please? Tell her good-bye for me. Tell her yourself. Temperature gauge... Homing mechanism... And I've rigged you a motion detector so you can track Spot's movement. - Thank you. - Are you sure - freezing this thing is gonna work? - Yeah, it worked in the blob. - Oh, very reassuring. - It's a living organism. The cells shouldn't be able to stand temperatures below 200 kelvin. Be careful. I should be able to handle a mindless eating machine. You looked at me again. The... No, no, I was... the... - You're pretty. - Oh, nice save. The blob? Must have been drawn by the emissions from the power station. But that emits alpha radiation, not gamma. Which means any source of radiation could be on the menu now. Including us. Awesome. I'm in. - <i>Now what?</i> - All right, Jack, watch yourself. Well, he's not detecting any movement down there. But the station's alpha emissions are at 20% and dropping. Jack, Spot's gotta be there. The relay station's on your left about 50 meters down.</i> Be careful. Yeah, thanks. Got a nice frozen treat for ya. Something's happening. Movement detected 40 meters away. Movement is minimal. Relatively stationary. Alpha emissions now at 10%. All right, maybe it's still working on dinner. It's on the move. Heading right towards him.</i> 30 meters and closing. - Alpha emissions depleted. - Talk about a dine and dash. 20 meters. I don't see it. Where is it? - 10 meters. - Jack, just look around. It's gotta be right in front of you. You should be able to see it. Or not. Jack, what's happening? You okay? Jack, come on. Say something!</i> What's going on? Yeah, how do you like me now, huh? Wait a second. It's moving away. 10 meters. 15 meters. Jack, what's happening? I think I made it mad. - It's back in the pipes. - I'm guessing not for long. So much for your Hollywood ending. So I was wrong about the cold thing. But Spot jumped off Fargo for a reason. Well, maybe it didn't like the way he tasted. - That's not bad. - I have my moments. Duncan's beauty cream? I mean, Fargo had it all over him. If it neutralized the gamma radiation in the guys, it might neutralize Spot. - So what's in it? - He used a variety of organic astringents, antioxidants, anhydrous desiccants. - Anhydro... hy... - Desiccants. It's a hydroscopic substance that induces dryness in its environment. - Like salt! - Yeah. Or salty things. Your brain is really an enigma. No, but could we use that to fight Spot? I mean, salt can kill slugs. By dehydration. So if Spot's physiology is similar, then Duncan's compound would have the same effect. Great. We get like a truckload of it and just flush it and kill it. I don't know. Freezing it only affected the outer shell. We need a better delivery system. Something that'll blast the compound inside-out. I think I got some guys who can help us. Bringing me behind enemy lines, deputy? You must really like me. Or I'm just trying to kill you. Which is it? - Hey, you're not green anymore. - But you're still stupid. Go figure. You guys made this mess. You can help us fix it. - What do you want? - Your camoscope. - Hand it over. - No can do, Sheriff. - You don't have clearance at Area 51. - But I do. Why are you slumming with these losers? Slumming? Who do you think you're fooling, Toby? You applied to transfer here three times. - Oh, busted! - Guys, we don't have time for this. - Hand it over. - Come on. - Here you go. - You got Duncan's formula? Time to put everybody's toys together. Let's go. - You first. - Oh, no, after you. Go! - Thanks. - Yeah, I love messing with those guys. What's going on? That was Spot breaking through the shut-off valves on the main pipeline. - It's gotten out of the building. - We gotta figure out where it's going. There are radiation sources all over town, including the people. Yeah, but globidium's still his favorite flavor, right? But everybody's turned it in. Well, not everybody. Who's left? Me. - Zoe, it's me. Are you at the house? - I'm at Café Diem. Good. Is Lexi with you? SARAH's not picking up. She got take-out and went home. Something wrong? I don't think she'll be dining alone. SARAH, can you get the door? SARAH, what's going on? You make me crazy. You know that? Come on in. You don't get to just decide everything. You're not the supreme decider. Supreme decider? You may have nothing else to say, all right, but I do. I'm not leaving until you hear it. I know we didn't plan for this. I know kids are gonna change things. Maybe we won't travel for a while. But when we do, at least we'll see things through the eyes of our kids. Honestly, I can't think of anything better. Okay, you say that now. But what about in six months or six years? This isn't a temporary assignment in Tanzania, Duncan. This is the rest of our lives. That doesn't scare me. I know I freaked out before, okay? But you don't have to doubt me now. Okay, it's not that doubted you. It just... When I was a kid, I always had the feeling that my dad would rather be somewhere else, and I would just hate it if you ever felt that way. Lexi, I love you. I want us all to be together. I know the timing isn't perfect. We're gonna have our problems. But whatever comes, we'll handle it. You might wanna reconsider. What is that? You know what? Get back! Get out of here! Lexi, go. Go. This is what it wants. Bowling? No, this is basically a salt center with a gamma radiation shell. When it loosens, you run. Does Spot want a treat? There you go. There you go. There you go. Okay. Okay, is it loosening? - Get ready. - It's working! Go! Everybody o... I'll take that as a yes. Can I take that as a yes? We don't have to live here, do we? I'm good. Perfect. A seven-ten split. That's gotta hurt. And with area 51 in the lead, Eureka needs the spare in order to win. The pressure is on. Come on, we can do this! Thought you guys were already down the road. - Oh, don't sound so anxious. - I'm not anxious. - I'm totally gonna miss you, aunt Lex. - I'm totally gonna miss you too. And I'm actually gonna miss you as well. And I'm actually almost touched. Don't worry, we'll come back and visit. Well, you better. Trying to watch a game here. Fargo, wipe the floor with them! Eureka wins! Well played, Fargo. Big of you to say, Bismark. - Doesn't make us friends, though. - I'll shake on that. - That's an amazing shot, Fargo. - Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you for not playing any more pranks. I appreciate that. Well, we won. We didn't really need to rub it in their faces. But we really wanted to. Gotta run. I love this town. Any luck identifying the source of the signal? We can't get an image. Our atmospheric window has closed. We'll have no way of knowing what's coming until it's on top of us. Unless we can figure out how to decipher the signal? Listen, Tess. General Mansfield is concerned that whatever's sending this signal may not be friendly. He's ordered me to prepare a defense system. What? Allison, you can't. Whatever it is, you could provoke it or you could scare it off.
