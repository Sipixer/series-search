He's lost a lot of blood. -Why don't we take him to a real vet? -We are,the best in the world. He's got a labin section 3. Hey,hear that,buddy? We're gonna fix you right up. you're gonna love this. Well,after three years of development I hope so. Have you decidedon a name yet? I like mental mouse because it formsa direct neural link between your cerebral cortexand the computer mainframe. Bluetooth for the brain. It looks likea melanoma. Well,that's because it's not turned on. So this transmitsmy thoughts directly to the computer. That's right. No need for a keyboardor a mouse. You think it here,comes out there. Fantastic. Except it doesn't work. What do you mean? I'm trying to accessyour personnel file and it's not working. Why are you tryingto access my file? To see if you'reremotely qualified to be tapping into mycerebral cortex. It's not working because it hasn't finished mapping your brain yet. In an hour or so,things will start popping up before you even know you want them.. Now,these lines representdifferent emotions. Red for anger,blue for happiness, green for depression. So you've equipped me with a very expensivemood ring. I'll take it from here. It's not a mood ring. It maps emotionsto better convert brain activityinto commands. -If you think about it,it's actually-- -fargo. Look at the screen. Uh,yeah,you--you can take it from here. My thoughts exactly. Taggart's your world-renowned vet? Graduated magna from the university of melbourne. I thought you werea cryptozoologist. Well,the studyof unknown species is more of a hobby. Which means he knows moreabout animals than any normal vet. It means he knows more about pretend animals. I can't fix this. Okay,let's take him to a real doctor. I said i cannot fix it. But my little friends can. You've made friends with sand now? Not sand.Nanoids. Remember carl carlson? We've been ableto reverse engineer some of his discoverieson cellular regeneration and adapt them to nanotechnology. Normally,I'm opposed to animal testing. But in this case, I'll makean exception. So you're gonna treat lowjack with itsy-bitsy robots? They've been programmed to analyze and mimic biological structuressuch as bone tissue and hair. They're activatedand controlled by ultra-low-frequencyradio signals. Man,that's a little creepy. Told you he was good. Their programming's simple. Repair and replicate. Just like human cells. They'll serve as sort of a living band-aid until his tissuescan heal. I assume I can trust you to let low jack go once he's healed? There's no sportin catching him in this condition. Sc-- Scout's honor. Mmm,there are no scouts in australia. Oh,yeah,there are.And believe me. I assume I can trust you to let low jack go once he's healed? I could tell you stories. Prefer you didn'T. Just take care of the dog. Will do,sheriff. -See you,jo. -Later,tag. -Tag? -Shut up. -Tag. -Shut up. I've got you now,my furry friend. All the years you've tormented me. Mocked me. Yeah,look who's laughing now. All right. Truce,then. But just till you'reup and about. -Dr. Stark? -Kinda busy,larry. You having anycomputer problems? Not till now. You should probably get that mole checked. Could be a melanoma. Do you need something,larry? I picked up a computer glitch in this area. It may require shutting downsections of the mainframe to isolate the problem. I'll need your authorization. It's always somethin. Just pray it's notthe lorena bobbitt virus. I'm sorry? Turns your hard driveinto a 3 1/2-inch floppy. Guess I'll get to it,then. Please. Lorena bobbitt virus. Kills me every time. I still rememberour first encounter. Here we go. Ironic that animal testing created you. Now it's saved you. But for a dog with a 130 I.Q., You should know to watch out for cars. Need to paycloser attention,mate. You'll wind up dead. That's how I've survived all these years. Attention to detail. What the-- How'd you get in here? Aaagh! -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> sync:YTET-cflily -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font> Eureka Season 1 Episode 09</font> I'm telling you,fargo,it's not working. It keeps bringing up stuff I'm not even looking for. Like what? What differencedoes that make? The subconscious is extremely open to suggestion. When I first tried it out,it kept bringing up buffy fan sites. Wh--which I'm totallynot into. Even on a-- um-- -a subconscious level. -Am I interrupting something? Actually Dr. Stark and iwere just discussing-- not even remotely. If you're hereto invite me to the lise meitner dance, I might still be available. Okay.You are not here to invite me to the dance. No. What's in the envelope? Oh. I see you've signed them. I just thought that,uh, seeing where we areright now... That,um,maybe it was time. Okay. I mean,unless you think that-- I think we should've done this a long time ago. I've just gotten so busy,sometimes,uh, little things get lost in the shuffle. Little things,right. And with everything that's happened between you and carter-- this has nothing to dowith carter. Well. I'll just put them in your box when I'm done. Fine. I guess that's it,then. Unless there's something elseyou needed. No. I think I,uh,got what I came for. Remember,jo,call me in two minutes. Not a second more. hey! What are you doing here? They asked me to helpset up for the dance. -What are you doing here? -Sound check. For--? The finale. I represent the band. You represent the band? Spencer.Yeah he's actually a really good musician. Groundbreaking beats, like moby meets devo. Moby...devo... spencer? No,not feel in it. We're still working on a stage name. But I have him booked monday nights at caffdiem. And I'm working on a deal with itunes. And,as his manager,I get 15%. And what's he get? Well,nothing so far.But-- jack. Hey,henry. -How you doin'? -Good. -How you doin'? -All right. So you got ropedinto this too,huh? This is eureka's mostimportant event of the year. Are you really hereto help set up? Uh,oh,yeah.Absolutely. I'd like nothing more. In that case,and on behalf of lise meitner? I thank you. And if I knewwho that was, that might mean something. She was an austrian physicist who discovered nuclear fission. Which then led to the inventionof the atomic bomb. Oh,well,by all means, let's celebrate that. Meitner refused to workon the bomb,dad. Tonight's dance is a tributeto her ingenuity, not what others choseto do with it. Her passion for exploration, her commitmentto bettering the world is the ideal eureka is meantto strive to meet. That's what we're celebrating. And celebrate we shall. Check out the subwoofer on this bad boy. That little thing? Hey,bigger isn'tnecessarily better. Keep tell in' yourself that. The next soundyou'll hear is me blow in your minds. Mind or eardrums? Moby. Devo. Hey,partner,what's up? Oh,hey,Allison. No,I was expecting someone,uh... else. What? Seriously? Yeah,yeah,I'll be right there. Um,sorry,everybody. I can't stay and help.Duty calls. Your dad is the worst liar. Well,luckily,I take after my mother. Larry called security but they only caught part of the call. What did he say? "Nice."The rest was garbled. -That's it?- -That's it. Yeah,that's what I thought. What? It's really creepyin there. That's some really sharppolice work,carter. Sure he didn't justgo out for a smoke or to his carfor a nap? -Carter. -Some people needtheir afternoon nap. Like me,for example. -Carter. -It's well documented,allison. A siesta works. It increases worker satisfactionand productivity, and it is a dying art. Napping is not an art. You haven't seen me nap. I take itto a whole new level. Stop stalling and get in the tunnel. I'd be more effective with the proper amount of rest.That's all I'm saying. Sheriff. I heard about larry. And I'm coming with you. Not that I don't enjoy your company,but why? He's one of my dearest friends. Uh--really? Are we talking about the same larry? Just because you choose not to fraternize with the support staff doesn't mean others don't. Which is your loss. Because larry happens to bea very sensitive guy. You wanna try out one of your new toys,don't you? I--I've--I got a new G.P.S. Locator and night-vision goggles. I brought me hand-me-downs for you. Lucky me. See anything? I'm in a long,dark tunnel. That's becauseyou don't have ultra-infraredvision goggles. Got me there. Not like larryto leave his post. I've got a bad feeling. Given where we are,I have a bad feeling. About ten more feet,we should hit a junction. We can split up there. Whoa,hang on. Fine,you baby. We'll stick together. But it's far more efficientif we split up. Taggart,shut up. You shut up. Just listen. What is that? Sounds insectoid. Is that even a word? Yeah,I think so. What's that? I don't know. But it got larry. We're going to need more fire power. Gopher carter. Hey,you guys need to come back. We have an problem. Yeah,more than one. A person is missing. We found his equipment in the service tunnel. I don't careif I'm missing. You don't go poking arounda billion-dollar mainframe without asking me. And you do not send a copand a glorified vet into the brainof global dynamics without following protocol. They're not even wearingcleansuits. Well,larry's still missing. What do you propose we doabout it? I don't care what you do. Just do not compromisethe safety of this facility while you do it. Look,I didn't want to go in there in the first place. W-what is that? It's my thresholdfor incompetence. Looks like a melanoma. Get out. Your hubby's in a mood. He's not my hubby anymore. I know,I know,he's your estranged husband. No,I gave him the divorce papers to sign. Which is why he'sin the mood. Seriously? Seriously. Uh,I'm just gonna gocheck on the pooch. Call meif you need me,sheriff. Yeah,I'll do that. Are you okay? Yeah,let's just focuson larry. Sure. Um-- we'll startwith the security footage, and then we'll doa floor-by-floor sweep. If he's in the building,we'll find him. I'm fine. There you are. People are looking for you. Lowjack? How'd you get out of your cage? I told 'em they were over reacting,but,um, you should probably tell 'em you're here. Get back here,you mutt! Where the hell did he go? Did you hear that? The last footage we have of larry is entering the service corridor. Then the abbreviated message. He never came out. He must bein there somewhere. I'm starting to wonder what else is down there with him. I've got an idea. Here's lowjack,locked in his cage. But I just saw him up on section 1. Or at leastI thought I did. Gave me the slip. That's the leastof our problems. You lost your nano-bugs? I didn't lose them.They escaped. -Where did they go? -Could they have gone there? That's where larry went.Taggart. I don't know how they got out. They were in deactivated sleep mode. It's not in their programming to initiate commands. Well,can't you use your um,remote control thingie and make 'em march home? I tried that. They're not responding. They must be out of range. Then you need to getwithin range. Inside the many miles of dark creepyservice tunnels.That's great. They can't get too far. The E.M. Umbrella will keep them inside global. What--what's that? Global dynamics is protected by an electromagneticbarrier. It prevents anyone from broadcasting any non-secured signals outor sending them in. The nanoids can't breachthe barrier without fryingtheir circuitry. We just need to get within range of the remote control. You better get to it,then. Where are you going? To tell nathan I wantto lock the facility down. The less area they haveto move around in, the faster we'll be ableto catch them. Dr. Stark. Is there somethingI can help you with? Dr. Stark,what are you doing? Why are you deactivating the E.M. Barrier? Dr. Stark? Oh no no--- Where is he? This is allison blake. I need to initiatesecurity protocol lockdown,level three. Dr. Stark is unavailable.This is my call. What was that? Lock down. That's comforting,considering we're stuck down here. Yeah.E.M. Burst gun,just in case. Just in case what? Mm-hmm,exactly. These nanoids,um-- How many are we looking at,exactly? I don`t konw. They're programmedto self-replicate, using any available sourceof carbon as fuel. Well,where do they getthe carbon? This,uh,computer stuff?I think. No,carbon's in anything living. I'm something living. So am I. This just getsbetter and better. Nathan,where have you been? There's a situation.Escaped nanotechnology. I had to put uson lockdown. Carter and taggartare searching now. Okay,please don't give methe silent treatment. It's obvious that you're upset with me. You know,I'm upset,too. Why don't we just talk about it? Some indication of how you're feeling would be nice. That would bean indication. Nathan. Why is your skin so cold? You hear that? I've got something. Yeah? We're getting closer. I think we're there. What is it? It's,um... their carbon source. Larry. Or what's left of him. Oh,no. You know,if you have that nanoidremote control handy now would be a really good time to use it. Anytime. I don't know how to say this. -It's not working? -That's how. Getting movement. Where? Right... There. Lowjack? This isn`t Lowjack There will never beenough showers for me to feel clean again. Did you know that was gonna happen? Absolutely not. Maybe a bit. Get the hell off me! What--sto-- na--nathan,what's wrong with you? Nathan,stop it. Nathan. Nathan,stop it. Yeah.That wasn't nathan. What the hell was that thing? Things.Taggart's nanoids can apparentlymake copies of us now. You've gotta be kidding me. No,they're on a binge.We found larry. Or what's left of him. -He's dead? -Devoured. And they're using his bodyas a carbon source. Then where's the real nathan? Caution.Electromagnetic barrier is disengaging. Dead or alive,we have to find him. We will.I promise. How do these things work? I mean,one is harmless, but a millioncan eat larry? It's calleddistributed computing. Each individual nanoidis like a brain cell. The more there are,the smarter they become. They communicate with each other over very low frequencies and sharethe thinking workload. Yeah,but they're justtiny computers,right? I mean,they runoff of programming. Right.Repair and replicate. So they need fuel. Exactly. Wow,excellent. So that's whatit was gonna do? Take my carbon and run around looking like me? I don't think so. I mean the nano-starkkissed you,right? I mean,kissing. That can't be a partof their programming. No,but it shows their exponential leapin intelligence. And a great tastein women. No,it knew it was me.I could feel it. Okay. So stark is the key,and-- --Uh,that monitorin his office is still working which meanshe's still alive somewhere. You're right. They just found him in section 3. Where is he? The master control room. Thank god.Open the door He's locked himself inside. No,he's locked us outside, or one of him has. You gotta get this door open. What's in this room? The computer mainframe. Uh,would the security systembe in there? And the E.M. Barrier.He could turn it off. Not without help.Even with the codes it has to be shut down manually from three differententry points by someone with fullsecurity clearance. Someone like stark? -We're good. -All right.Back me up. Aw,man. This is really bad. They've got dr. Starkat exit 5. Wait--exit 7. And exit 9. Those are the shutoff points. They're making a break for it. The E.M. Barrier's down. There's nothing to prevent them leaving the building. Sir,all exit points have been breached. We have multiple starksoutside of the building. And I thought one starkwas bad. There's no stopping them now. We have to find them. They're replicating exponentially. Well,you knowthe program. What kind of numbersare we talking about? By this time tomorrow,there-- there could bethousands. Next week,millions.Millions of starks? That's horribleto think about. Well,we obviously can't wait that long. Okay,weapons.What do you have that can knock 'em out? The reverse gunsare short-range. We'll never get all of them. -Do you have anything bigger? -Aside from a nuclear bomb,no. You have a nuclear bomb? I didn't say that. Sound the warning system. Eureka's on lockdown. No one goes outsideuntil every stark is stopped. -Carter? -This is the answer -What -Stark. I think we've establishedthat,mate. No,I mean,why replicate stark? Why not larryor the it worker, or lowjack? They foundthe perfect specimen. You're not going backto dogs after that. But he's not perfect. Have you seen his abs? Damn close. My point is we can't stopevery stark out there. But we can stopthe one stark in here. Well,every minutewe're looking for him, they're out there multiplying. But if we can find the original, if we can find nathan, then maybe we can figure outa connection. Well,where do we start to look? I know.I know.Don't even say. I never,ever wantto come down here again. Looks like they'veall gone. Well,he's gotta be in here somewhere. At this rate,it could take us all day. Yeah. Hang on.I'm getting something. More nanoids? A different signal. Dead ahead. And it's not moving. Here we go. Stark! He's still alive. The last thing I remember was larry attacking me. And after that,it's all a dream. I mean,one minute I'm kissing allison, and then next... I was a dog. I think somehow your dream sare becoming reality, and I think it has something to do with that little glowing mole thing. Neural interface system. Transmits my thought commands directly to the computer network. Is it possible that the signals got crossed? Gonna kill fargo. Get back here. How was I supposedto know that my mental mouseand taggart's nano-bugs shared the same frequency? Okay,so turn it off.Problem solved. No,wait. What? We need to severthe connection. Well,unless it's ouronly connection. I mean,think about it. Your doublesare still out there, and they're no longer responding to taggart's remote control. So that gizmo might beour only way of reaching them. Your thoughts,your subconscious thoughts, your dreamsmust have been transmitted into their programming. Okay,so they're respondingto the last command that they gotbefore the signal went weak? Uh,in theory,yeah. Okay. What was the over all them of your last dream? Oh,come on,stark. This is no time to be bashful. W-well,there was some wish fulfillment, fantasies in there. Like? Allie. And some other stuff. I need specifics. The usual.Power, success control over...everything. You dreamabout world domination? Not all the time. Yeah,gopher carter. Everyone's off the streets, except a whole lotof nathan starks. You may wanna get down here.Over. -How many now? -Too many to count.Over. Uh,we're working on it. Hang tight. So,assuming that we cancontact these things through stark... what do we do? Stop them from communicating with each other. They'd be reducedto single cells. No threat at all. So how do we do that? Interference. A loud enough low-frequencyblast of sound. Uh,we--something below human hearing. Say in the two hertz range. Two hertz? To generate any volume you'd need a massive speaker at least eight feetin diameter. No. Bigger's not always better.Come on. We're running out of time. You sit here.Allison,you ready? I still don't understand what we're doing. Good. You four,I need youto go in the booth, shut it,lock it,wait for my signal. Thanks,henry. I need you to focuson bringing 'em here. Focus,nathan. Command them with your mind. Summon them with your will. Conjure them wi-- seriously? Sorry. Just concentrate. It's not working. I can tell it's not working. He's too focused. His rational mind'soverruling his subconscious. All ego.No id. Hey. You are a stupid, selfish,egomaniacal sack of crap,and I am astonished that you've gottenas far as you have. Coming from you,that's a compliment. Okay,slight change of plan. Well,it's good to know the fate of the world depended on your last one. Hey,spencer,could you play something, uh,romantic? Psh.No problem. We're gonna serenade them into submission now? Just sit and watch. May I have this dance? Um,right place, very wrong time. Just roll with it. Might be our last chance. Could--maybe--I lead? I'm sorry.It's--it's habit. Have--have I ever told youhow amazing you are? Um...no. You're strong. Independent. And smarter than ten women put together. And I think another ten times as beautiful. That's really flattering.I-I-- just realized what you're doing. I mean every word. what I'm about to do... I do for god and country. All right,you can stop.It's not working. It's working. I said,you can give i ta rest. It's having absolutely no effect. They're coming your way,carter. I repeat,they're headed your way. Do you copy? Hello? -It worked. -Yeah. No,no,no. They're coming. Yeah,right. I-I-I hope you have a plan. be careful,carter. Oh,my god.Look at all of them. It's a miracle. -Wait for it. -We don't have that much longer . Few more seconds.Carter! Wait!Carter! that's it. They're all inside,carter. Now,spencer,now! Dr. Stark,are you all right? Fargo, never,ever, ever mess with mycerebral cortex... again. Okay,we'll get the wraps over here,please. And,fruit,come with me,please. You okay?Good,good,good. Having a good time? great. I think we'll dropsome fruit here, please. You know,I hate to admit it, but spencer's pretty good. The kid's my ticket. The kid's your ticket? Way to be supportive. You're gonna beyour own ticket. Think vincent's out done himself,huh? You've out done yourself. -What? -Allison. It was quite a kiss. It was just for show. Just,uh to make stark angry. Do I look that naive? Honest,it was nothing to worry about. I'm not worried. I'm--I mean,I'm not happy,either. But... I don't know.I mean... maybe it's time. To generate any volume you'd need a massive speaker Just... don't ever make out in front of me again. Thanks. What do you think? It's nice. Nice? Well,with this crowd I expected,you know, a little more than centerpiecesand linen napkins. That sounds like you're starting to get used to this crowd. Spencer! Ready? Only in eureka. Guess that kiss made him realize what he was missing,eh,sheriff? Yeah,I guess. No explainingsome relationships. You look unbelievable. Thank you. Do you...wanna...dance? I'd be honored. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> sync:YTET-cflily -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font> Eureka Season 1 Episode 09  Hey,buddy. Looks like it's just you and me,huh?
