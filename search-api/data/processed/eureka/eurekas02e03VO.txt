you can put this tragedy behind you? Never. According to Nathan Stark the artifact appears to be dead. Energy of that magnitude doesn't just die.</i> It had to go somewhere. How about, this saturday night, You, me, ribs, root beer, and espn classic? They're showing the lakers game we went to around your ninth birthday. - It was my sixth. - Yeah. Actually, I was thinking more like red bull and pizza at Pilar's house. Oh! cos... it's your birthday, I figured we could do something together. Just the two of us. Yeah. That's nice, but... you know, i'm turning 16, not 60. Which still qualifies you as a minor. Wearing that doesn't qualify as a shirt, so... put on a jacket. - We're in the middlhe of a heat wave. - <i>Today's forecast calls for heat,</i> frost, rain, hail, gale force winds, and severe lightning. I'll have fargo give her a checkup. You know, I just... I wanna do something normal, like... a party with my friends. I think I liked it better when you were six. Hey, Pilar. What are you doing? Dad! Hey, Sheriff. Bye, Sheriff. Pilar, just so you know, Zoe already has plans for her birthday. - Bummer. - Yeah, bummer. Okay, enough mortification. Have a great day! I'll remember this when you're getting arrested on dateline. Nice. No, we're planning the... surprise party. Hey, Kevin. What is... november 3rd, 1957? Tuesday. Pretty sure it was a thursday. Nope. Tuesday. Whatever. Still gonna look it up. Have a good day, sweetie. Good luck. He's in a great mood. Yeah, he's been... different recently. - Like he's opening up. - That's great. Isn't it? Yeah. Of course. - Can we... - Yeah. Yeah. So, are you gonna come to Zoe's surprise party? Oh, me? I thought you were into young brunettes. No, no. I'm into old brun... - That didn't come out right, did it? - No. No. Well, we got a D.J. and... you really haven't lived until you've seen me dance to hips don't lie. Well, you're on, old man. You wanna get a cup of coffee? I got a meeting. But... you can ask me again. - You'd better... - Yeah. Morning! It's been six months. Six months since months since what? Six months since you said we would discuss my promotion in six months. Jo, there's no official position between yours and mine. Great. I'll take yours. Today, you're not gonna bother me. Today is a great day for Jack Carter. Zoe has no idea about her surprise party, and I have a rain check for a coffee date. You said you'd make a call to D.C. for special consideration. But you're not very good at doing things that you don't really wanna do. Tell you what. Because everything's going well for me and because I'm such an amazing guy, I will make the call, right now. Hello? Maybe it's a sign. I think the gods are angry with you. And what makes you think that they're not angry at you? Oh, because I'm an amazing guy. Jack? Abby? What are you doing here? Well, that's a nice way to welcome your ex-wife. The Projet-SG Team presents: Timing: Golgi, Linwelin. Transcript: ragbear.com Edition:   Golgi, Linwelin. Proofreading: Golgi. - Season 2 | Episode 3 - Unpredictable (v. 1.1) - You could have given me a heads up. - It's her 16th birthday. You could have given me an invitation. Thank you, sheriff Lupo. - It's deputy. - Deputy. Until your husband chooses to promote me. Uh, ex. And I said I'd make the call. Jack doesn't like doing things Jack doesn't wanna do. Tell me about it. Phones are back. - You look good, Jack. - Does she know you're coming? You look good too, Abby. Come on. You do. - It's just... - You hate surprises. Especially when I don't know they're coming. well, look, we had an agreement, and it's been a year. I just assumed we'd talk about it again. Fine, let's talk. Deputy. Rub it in. There's been an accident at the spa. Eureka has a spa? Yeah. It's a fission-powered hot spring. It's members only. There's been a... malfunction. Can you check it out? Abby and I are gonna go... for coffee. Thanks. Nothing would make me happier. Sir. - Hey, Sheriff. - Hey, guys. - Morning, Sheriff. - Morning. Did you see them? Just like... clones. Very similar. Why is it only raining over there? Pacific Northwest. Look... Zoe loves it here. She couldn't be happier, and she's really thriving. I think it's the best thing we could have done for her. You sure that that's her perception and not yours? - Don't do that. - What? The shrink thing you do where you mak, you know, You sound like you're the better parent. It's called insecurity, and it stems from the person listening, not the person speaking. And remind me again why I used to think it was fun to fight with you. Because you like a challenge. With these unstable pressure systems, I predict a whopper of a storm is coming our way.</i> I'm pete puhlman for Storm Watch. So, I thought I'd stay a week, and... we'd have a party and we'd still have two days before Zoe and I... My special double yolk quail egg omelet with estonian caviar and basil grafted from an italian monastery. Thank, Vincent. Oh, my god. Is that truffle oil? Yes! Finall, a refined palate! The last time I served it to him, he asked for ketchup. On the house. Except for the muffin. Let's talk. Look at those two. Oh, now I just feel sick. Hey, what a surprise! Hate surprises. Meeting, huh? Brunettes, huh? I was just telling Jack what a striking couple you are. - Well, thank you. - Thank you. And you are... Jack's evil ex-wife, Dr. Abby Carter. Dr. Allison Blake. Dr. Nathan Stark. All these doctors. Your worst nightmare, Jack. He used to hate it when I dragged him around to my alumni functions. He called it death by dull. He is very clever. So... will you be staying at the house? - No. - Yes. We're... Do... We're... setting her up at Beverly's. Well... then I guess I'll see you at Zoe's party. I hear there'll be dancing. Oh, Jack and I won a macarena contest in Cabo once. Do you remember that, Jack? I can't wait for the party. You may think you've put the past behind you but... these things take time. The heart doesn't heal overnight. Nor should it. That's why it's important to find constructive ways - to work through the pain. - Which is precisely why I want to continue Kim's research. Is that the only reason? Does it matter? When you're asking to work at the most advanced research facility on the planet I'm afraid it does matter. And does everybody at G.D. fall under this level of scrutiny? Of course. Including Kim. Were you seeing kim? On and off. More during the months leading up to her... to the accident. But you never talked about her research. Up to a point. My security level doesn't cover section five projects. But she told me what she could. So you never visited her lab. No. Right. Hum. Sorry. Go ahead. We're done. Same time tomorrow? Absolutely. Yeah? Hot, yeah? - Yeah. - Yes, I've noticed. It's crazy. I come to turn on the nuclear bubbles, and look what I see. What... what is this? My first big case. So is Zoe excited at all? Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure, I guess. You guess. Abby, we should talk. Oh, god, Jack. Never thought it was settled. Assumed we're gonna talk about. - We had an agreement. - That was before. Before what? Before probably the greatest year of my life. And when were you planning on sharing this with me? I don't know... The next time you called. I didn't plan on you just showing up. God, Jack, you know, you've had a year. This is just like you. This is so unfair. It's... It's snowing. What is it with this place? I... Hold on. Yeah, Jo, it's not a good time right now. It's, uh... snowing. What? Did... did you call Henry? Okay. Um... I'll be there as soon as I get Abby settled. - Thanks. - Abby is not settling this time, Jack. We didn't close the entire spa. No reasonable cause of panic. I've got sciatica and no one's ever told me about this place? It's on G.D. property, Carter. You guys don't belong here. Employees only. We're here on official business. The grotto closure. Yeah, inconvenient. At least Alma's still giving Shiatsu. You have shiatsu? Carter, off this way. Is that embroidered? Membership has its privileges. You mean those brainiacs use a nuclear reactor to heat their whirlpools? Not the reactor. Just the byproduct from the core cooling system. This is a byproduct of a cooling system? Flash freezing? Not likely. Well, we'd better get an I.D. Okay... Which piece do we start with? Still think these nuclear hot tubs are safe? You know, temperatures would have had to have dropped to minus 460Â° fahrenheit. - Like that. - Yeah, but you see what happens when they change the natural order of things? Everything's under control, then somebody throws a wrench in something working perfectly fine for unselfish reasons. Then your life is shattered, and she's blaming you. What? Are we still talking about the reactor? - Yeah. - What? Okay, so how are we gonna get an I.D. now? Just look for a finger. How about a... a thumb? You sure that's a thumb? Only if it has a print. Baxter, Neil. G.D. employee. number 185627. It's a thumb. I can't explain the death. Scientifically, the reactor just doesn't make sense. I mean, if the hot springs had boiled, i'd say, you know, maybe there was a leak. Henry mentioned something about the cooling system? Which doesn't go below 20 degrees. Skiing weather. Okay, so like the snow at Beverly's. I don't know, Carter. Why don't you look into it? Unless you're too busy with personal matters. Did I miss something? I... I just want to get this figured out as quickly as possible. Oh, my god. You're jealous. - Of? - What do you think? - Oh, please. - Come on. - You have nothing to worry about. - I'm not worried. You know what, let's just stay focused on work so we can avoid these awkward moments. These awkward moments are the only social life I have left. Check this out. This was Baxter, the frozen guy's lab. I've been filling in sometimes. Baxter was conducting a real-time field study on the mating habits of a tribe in Tanzania. You see those two? It's Danny and Sandy. They've been together since they were teenagers. How about the jumpy one? Tom. He's been like that since he hooked up with Katie. Exactly how much time have you spent down here, Fargo? Baxter put up a live webcast every day to poll viewer reaction to the relationship dynamics. Better than the Bachelor. Was he working with anyone else? I wouldn't call it working. He was known to do a lot of field testing with the female lab techs, if you know what I mean. Gave new meaning to the term wild - monkey... - Please stop that. ... a total mystery to me. I'm scared, Henry. In three days, Zoe turns 16. Any man who says he understands women is either naive or a liar. Apparently, Baxter did. He was the Casanova of section three. I've questioned six women who thought he was god's gift to their gender, even when there wasn't enough of him to go around. - There certainly is now. - Yeah. What did allison say? - She doesn't think it was the reactor. - She's right. The cooling system could not create a temperature that low to freeze tissue that fast unless we were into China Syndrome times five. Well, I have Jo retracing his last day. It's gonna take me a little time to get you an accurate time of death. I have to wait for this tissue to thaw. Yeah, or we could just read his watch. - Got 12... 26. - 26. You know, if we were that smart about women... Oh, no, what time... Zoe. - Oop. - Yep. got it. So... what's the one next to mercury? Gold... every girl's favorite element. Zoe. That's my mom. You didn't tell me. I wanted to surprise you. I hate surprises. You're just like your dad. We've got so much to talk about. Come on. Hey, sweetie. I thought i'd swing by and pick you up... She promised... No, it's terrific! I mean, yeah, surprise! Just, um... don't talk to her till I get there. All right. Bye. Okay, I give up. So where do you live? In there. Both of you? It's underground. Oh. Well, that makes so much more sense. Hi, Jack. Hi, dad. Hi. Um, what are you doing? I asked you to wait. Has she spoken to you? - What? - You told her. This is so like you! You're just tearing whatever's good for you. I'm gonna look like the bad guy, just because you want to come here and take away my kid. What are you talking about? You didn't tell her. No. But you just did. Can someone just treat me like a person and tell me what's going on? Your mom and I had an agreement when you came to live here. - What kind of agreement? - I just wanted us to be a family. Just you and me, you know... with no time limit. - But there was a time limit. - It was a year, and then you would come back to L.A. with me - and you to tell her. - Don't blame me. Okay, that's enough. This isn't about either of you, okay? You've already ruined your own lives. Just leave mine alone. - Zoe... - It's so... What is happening? S.A.R.A.H., door. What the hell was that? That would be a severe dust storm precipitated by unstable pressure systems.</i> What the hell was that? That... that was, uh, the house. Abby, House. House, Abby. This is that Abby? - Your house talks to you? - Yeah. - Uh, listen, Zoe. We... - I'm going to my room. Sweetie, wait, wait. we have to talk about this. Just give her some space. Oh, so now you're the expert. Yeah. I am. She's a different kid and i'm a different parent than I was a year ago. And I know I was awful, but you gotta cut me some slack while I figure out why we almost ended up in kansas. Look, hey, uh, S.A.R.A.H., you said we'd have some freaky weather today. How'd you know it? I receive weather updates every quarter hour from the eureka channel.</i> From the weather guy? Mr. Puhlman prefers meteorologist. He's a little sensitive about it.</i> - Okay. I gotta talk to him. - No, no, you have to talk to me and our daughter. I know, and I will. I just have to deal with this first. And - No, I can't go into it. - Sure. Go to work. Your hiding place. Hey, Jo, it's Carter. Look... You're much shorter than I pictured you, Abby. A volatile storm system is taking us to level yellow, so everyone is strongly encouraged to stay indoors. The cumulator 2100 is predicting high winds, sporadic downpours, and more frost on Socrates Avenue so keep it tuned to storm watch, because we're in for one wild ride, folks. I'm Pete Puhlman. Sorry about that. - Emergency updates all day long. - Yeah. - How can I help you? - I don't know. I hope you can tell me what's going on with the weather. - Yeah, no problem. - Okay. See... Cumulator 2100. The most sophisticated meteorological predictor in the industrialized world. Wow. If I had a nickel for every time i'd heard that... Continue. It all began with a severe temperature drop last night over the hot springs which precipitated a chain reaction of unstable pressure systems. The rain downtown, the snow on the north side, the dust storm, all... Yeah. All caused by the initial drop in pressure. Watch. The pressure drop began here. by the time it hit the hot springs, insta-freeze. So the freaky weather didn't cause the freeze, the freeze caused the freaky weather. Exactly. Okay, so the question is what's there? - Hi, Allison. - Hi, Beverly. - This is, uh, crazy weather. - I know. I appreciate you coming. I'm always happy to come to the office for a session. Actually, I didn't call you here for me. It's henry. I need him cleared to work at G.D. Well, our sessions are going well. I think maybe in another few weeks... I'm afraid I can't wait that long. Henry's in a fragile state of mind, Allison. He's not ready. I'd like to help you out, but I have to put him first. I'm afraid in good conscience I can't sign off on this. All right. Then i'll do it myself. Fargo. It's me. Henry Deacon is being cleared to return to Global. I know. I'm coming in for a debriefing. We need to strategize. - Jo, I sent you a picture with a map... - Got it. - Check out what's there. - Did it. - Pretty... - Good lead. I know. So if you let me do my job for a change... Emphasis on change... Jo, I have enough women who are mad at me today. - I found a cabin. - What? Where? Right smack-dab in the middle. And it's owned by Dr. Steven Whiticus. And you'll never guess who was the last person to call baxter the night he died. Steven Whiticus. Well, no. Um, His wife. Wendy. Baxter was field testing the wife? Maybe the husband found out and, you know, crime of passion. Okay. I'll check out the cabin. You check out the doctor. - She's gone, Jack. She ran away. - What? It's just like before. All right, did she take anything with her? No, she just... she left the house by herself. Well, she does that all the time. I mean, she's not gone, Abby. She's 16. Yeah, but how do you know for sure? Because I do. I know her. She wouldn't run away. Not like that. Not anymore. Oh, so I'm the only parent that she runs away from. Is that what you're saying? I'm not saying that. what I am saying is that things have changed. You haven't changed, Jack. You've always put your work before us. That's why she started running away to begin with. Okay. - Let's go. - What? Look, I have to work, so if you wanna talk, you have to come with me. See? Change. I'll call from Whiticus's cabin. She's still not answering. It's because she's still pissed. And whose fault is that? Oh, well, mine, obviously. Because everything bad that happens would be my fault. Well, I wouldn't say everything bad. - She'll call when she's ready. - Yeah. - That's her. - Good. Hey, sweetie, thanks for calling. we really app... yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I was wrong. I... s... What did she say? She's fine. She never wants to talk to either one of us again. But she's fine. She spends the night at a friend of hers. Pilar's. Nice girl, actually. Good influence. I think you'd like her. Uh, wait here. I'im gonna go take a look around. Welcome to Eureka. So you were the last person to see Neil Baxter alive last night. Relationships are so complicated. I mean... I love my husband. He's a brilliant man. It's just that, uh, Neil gave me something I haven't had for so long. Passion can be so powerful. Okay, so you two were together last night? At the cabin until about midnight. And then I drove home and Neil went to the Hot Springs. He always liked to soak after... Wendy! Come take a look at this! Mrs. Whiticus. I'm going to have to ask your husband some questions. Darling, look. A typhoon. That was crazy, huh? The... the storm. Yeah. So you wanna talk about it? It's been such a hard year, Jack, you know, all by myself. And I've been thinking about so many things, you know? Like... how we got to this place after 15 years. I miss Zoe so much. and I hate to admit it, but I missed you too. - Are you listening to what i'm saying? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me a sec. Unbelievable. What the hell? Yeah... does this look like a... crazy weather machine to you? Oh, like I would know? Good point. Hold on. Jo, it's me. I'm out at whiticus's cabin. I think I found something. Yeah. I've tried to get a hold of you. I found something in his basement. He's created mini-climates using some kind of microwave technology. Any chance it looks like a... big, scary satellite dish? Yeah, based on the schematics. Yeah. And if what I'm seeing down here is any indication of what you're gonna see out there, it's gonna be a bumpy night. Well, keep him there. I'm on my way over. Look, Abby... I know. Can we talk about it another time? No need. Just... just take me home. I think I've seen enough. I'm gonna have to take you in for questioning. - What? - Dr. Whiticus, you're under arrest for the murder of Neil Baxter. - I don't understand. - Please, you're making a mistake. - He can't leave the house. - You found out baxter and your wife were having an affair, you froze him with a giant... Okay, stop! He couldn't have killed anyone. He's practically blind. His eyes are too sensitive to leave the house, even at night. We have special lights, filters on all the windows. Could have had an accomplice. Why would I want to kill the man who finally brought happiness to my wife? Hey, look who made it for pizza! There's not gonna be any pizza. Come on, sweetie. Can you wait for mommy in the car? What's going on, Allie? Nathan, I'm going to ask you a question, and I swear, if you lie to me... I'm listening. I know about KB-201. - I really wanted to tell you. - Tell me what? That you brought my son to study him? That you put his life at risk? The only reason we studied him is to make sure his life isn't at risk. What are you talking about? Kevin has a connection to the artifact. He draws pictures. He makes models. He knows exact geometric details. We've been trying to understand why. He has been different ever since that accident in section five. He was down there, and you didn't tell me! Alli, I would never put him in harm's way. You have to know that. I don't know anything anymore, Nathan. Get in the car. Where'd this come from? Make it stop! It's okay, baby. Make it stop. Make it stop. It's okay, baby. It's gonna pass. Make it stop! Please tell me what's happening. I don't know yet. You knew about the affair? Well, my eyes may not work very well, but... it doesn't mean I'm totally blind. I always knew I wasn't enough for wendy, even... before the accident. The glasses help you see. Infrared wi-fi signal lets them augment the little bit of retinal usage that I retain. The... array thing we found at the cabin. Could that have caused the frost? Well, I designed it to refreeze the melting polar ice caps, to bring rain to drought-plagued nations. But... there were calibration problems that I was working to fix. That's what led to my accident. I decided to stop the project because it was too dangerous, and I didn't want it to harm anyone else. - Would Wendy? - What possible reason would she have to want to hurt anyone? She was at the cabin that night. and she wasn't baxter's only... experiment. You know, jealousy is a very powerful... You said the device went off at 12:26. - Yeah. - But I called her the minute I heard the frost predicted on the news. She was home by midnight. The 11:00 news with Pete what's-his-name? - The weatherman. - Meteorologist. He's pretty touchy about it. Yeah. well, Peter's always been very touchy. He was part of the dish installation team. He's always craved the limelight. If he hadn't have predicted the ice storm, I guess... Yeah, then maybe it wouldn't have happened. Jo, can you watch him? Hey, Allison. It's Carter. Meet me at the TV station. Hey, Pete, it's getting pretty nasty out there. You have any good news for us? Well, it's a category four ice storm, which will reach full strength in the next few hours. It must be a weatherman's dream. My job is to serve the community, which you should be evacuatin, Sheriff. Because this will be a direct hit. It's amazing how accurately you've predicted each hit. I know. My cumulator technology is... - very precise. - Yeah! When you predicted that ice storm at 11:18, we were in a heat wave. Who would have thought an hour later you could be ice skating on the hot springs? - Apparently, not Neil Baxter. - Yeah. His death was tragic. If he'd only seen my forecast, maybe it could have been prevented. Or maybe it could have been prevented if somebody hadn't turned on the... weather dish death machine while he was soaking in the grotto. Are you referring to... Dr. Whiticus's climate dish array? - You think that's what caused all this? - Pretty sure. I warned him. I warned him, it was reckless to continue his research. Honestly, that thing should be destroyed. That'd be a relief to you, uh? Why would I... Well, if Whiticus can control the weather, there's not much need for a weatherman, is there? - I had nothing... - You started the storm so you could be a hero, and whiticus's research - could be shut down once and for all. - You can't prove that. Actually, I can. We found footprints by the dish. Odd thing, though... There was no tread. Now, who would wear dress shoes to tramp around in the woods after midnight? Uh, Pete? Now, why don't you save us the trouble of matching our prints to your shoes and help us stop this thing. No, I never... I never meant to hurt anyone. I mean, I didn't even know that Wendy and Baxter were out there. I'm not a killer, Sheriff. I'm just... I'm so tired of no one taking me seriously as a scientist in this town. I mean, it works. My technology is the vanguard. Well, it won't matter if the storm wipes out the town. and we only have a few hours to save it. Yeah... make that one hour. It's been building since last night. It is an incredibly dangerous confluence of meteorological events. - A perfect storm. - Thank you. A spinning cyclone of instability high up into cryosphere. - Ice funnel of death. - Gotcha. Why don't you say "Ice funnel of death?" How is this happening so far from the ocean? Lake archimedes. Cos of all the volatility in the area, it's providing enough cold moisture for the storm to brew, and it's happening fast. This is tomorrow. - There's no way to stop it? - Well, warm tropical currents could counteract an event like this, but... - we're nowhere near an el nino. - I might have to evacuate the town. No, there's no time. We might end up with a bunch more frozen baxters. Look, all we need is warm water, right? If your dish thingy could freeze the hot springs, could it heat a lake? Theoreticall, it could. But it doesn't have the range. Presumably, it's attached to a mainframe in the cabinet. It's attached underneath the house. It heats the house. An environmentally conscious design. That's it. The lake is the water source for the hot spring? Linked to the reactor by an underground aquifer. So you crank up the juice at G.D., and we build some steam. I'm gonna need a coat. Hey, how's it looking on your end? We're at 850 degrees celsius. Are you there yet? Yeah. but not for long. Inside the main control panel of the dish array is an override switch. You need to manually aim the dish directly at the lake to get it to flash boil the water. If it evaporates too slowly, we only strengthen the hurricane.</i> So no pressure. Timing is critical. You need to activate the dish when we reach 1,000 degrees celsius to hit the flash boil point. I found the override. Where do I aim it? You need to dial it 60 degrees to the northeast. We're at 975 degrees. Got it! Almost there. You ready? Hang on! We're at 1,000 degrees! - You have to do it now! - I'm trying! How hard is it to push a button? You wanna do it? Carter! He did it. Carter, are you okay? Carter? Say something. I want a raise. Like they think this is a solution, bouncing me back and forth. Well, who would you choose? I mea, if you had to. Your mom or your dad? Well, if they loved me, they wouldn't make me. but... right now i'm just so mad at my dad for lying to me. Well, you know, sometimes people have good reasons for lying. There is no good reason for lying. Surprise! I hate surprises. Any job offers? Yeah, a few. I heard 17. It would be crass to count. Just so you know, I traced the email on KB-201. I know you sent it. I just wanted what was best for Kevin. Give me one second. Henry, I've arranged for everything to be unsealed tomorrow... Kim's section five records, all of her data. Oh, thanks. It... - It means a lot to me. - Me too. Thank you. So has she said anything to you? Not a word. - Me neither. - But it really is a really nice party. Yeah. I'm glad she's having fun. Mr. and Mrs. Macarena. I really hate him. So what do we do now? What do you want to do? I don't know. Well, then Zoe and I
