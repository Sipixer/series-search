a bit of a rough start, but I think I'm getting the hang of this job. I mean, things are actually calm at Global... Don't... don't even... don't tempt fate. - I don't believe in fate, Carter. - No, just stop. Honestly, I'll turn around, run home, and take a shower. Oh, god, I wish I could take a shower. You know, my water heater's broken. All the greatest scientists in the world in a 3-mile radius, and I can't find a decent plumber. I'll take a look at it for you. You? No, you don't understand. No, I'm really handy. I know what you're thinking... is there anything this guy can't do? Yeah, that's exactly what I'm thinking. - You want a drink? - Uh, sure. Yeah. Is it too early for happy hour? Well, if you consider Vincent's veggie blend happy, then, no. Well, not quite what I had in mind. But here's to quiet afternoons. What was that? Either someone's doing construction, or... you got a pest problem. Yeah. Definitely a pest problem. Hello, Sheriff. you running or swimming? Baby, I didn't expect you guys home so soon. Oh, Kev's helping me install a new system for his music therapy. Well, I offered to fix Allison's water heater. Really? Interesting Allison didn't mention it's a fusion water heater... and that to work on one you need a PHD from MIT. Which I happen to have. Right. I'd better go. Thanks for the run. Yeah. Thanks for the happy hour. I'm sorry. - I'll make it up to you next time. - You're on. Don't hurt yourself out there. PHD from MIT. Very bad boy, Sparky. I told you to stay close. Now it is time for your leash. Oh, Sparky, hey! Come back! Come back here right now. Bad dog. Stay out of the street. Get back here. Oh, man. Jeez! Can you hear me? Buddy, here. Give me your hand. I'm gonna get you out of here. Can you give me your name? You all right? What's your name? Sheriff Carter? Crap. The Projet-SG Team presents: Timing:   Golgi, Mnk, Ricana. Transcript:   swsub.com Edition:   Golgi, Linwelin, Mnk, Ricana. Proofreading:   Golgi, Linwelin. - Season 2 | Episode 6 - Noche de Suenos (v. 1.0) Relax, Carter. It's standard procedure with chemical spills. The most dangerous neurotoxins were neutralized by the waste scrubbing process. Decontamination only works if it comes into contact with bare skin. The faster you scrub down, the better. You're enjoying this, aren't you? No. Ok, switch it on. SARAH, door. - What happened to you? - I tempted fate. SARAH, can I have a beer waiting for me? I detect that you're upset, Sheriff. - <i>But alcohol isn't the answer.</i> - No, I'm not. And, yes, it is. Yeah, he's upset. Morning. Damn. We're out of fresh ground vinspresso. Be right back. Morning. How's it going? Carter, what are you doing? Oh, not again. Haven't had that one since college. SARAH, OJ. Hey, morning. You okay? Yeah, just a weird nightmare I had last night. Me too. How you feeling? I'd rather not talk about it. You know, I'm in enough therapy already. Poached eggs and sausage, Zoe? Actually, I think I've lost my appetite. I'm just gonna... get something at school. Gotta go. Sometimes I think she says these things just to hurt me.</i> No. I say things just to hurt you. She's just a teenager. Morning. Any word on the driver? Something funny about toxic waste exposure? No. Something is funny about Sheriff Carter exposure. I had this dream last night, and you were naked, walking around, doing your normal Carter thing like</i> nothing was wrong. What? Yeah. You came in. You bent over by the fridge... just like that, and... cute birthmark, by the way. And then went off to get fresh-ground vinspresso. Yeah. How did you know that? Just a hunch. What could cause us to share the same dream?</i> I need... coffee before I can contemplate that. Maybe we've developed a deep, subconscious connection. Like soldiers in battle. Or maybe it's that I was marinated in radioactive waste. That seems more likely, doesn't it? Hey, Vince, we're out of coffee. Uh, fresh ground vinspresso coming up. Oh, see, Vincent, here's a perfect example of where you could be much more efficient. Dr. Childress is expert on productivity and time management. She helps me to be more efficient. How do you become a doctor of efficiency? I'm a neurologist at Global. I just do this for fun. I search to maximize people's cognitive potential through neural networking. You should have her help you, Sheriff. What are you saying? Nothing. I'll... I'll get your coffee. Great. Thanks. Uh, driver's awake, and Allison wants to see us. Oh, great. Hey, Vince, w'ell pick up a little later. This isn't just another traffic accident, Carter.</i> Global Dynamics has the most advanced waste reduction technology in the world. Well, having taken a bath in that waste, I can tell you there's still plenty. Well, that truck contained six months' worth of hazardous material. Without our distillation and scrubbing process, that much waste could fill Lake Erie. So basically, you boil it down to just the really dangerous stuff. The spill was contained. My point is that whenever there's an accident involving GD technology and materials, we have to rule out sabotage. What would any one have to gain with crashing a hazardous waste truck? I don't know, Carter. That would be your job. Oh, make sure to note my elevated pulse. And there's a mild tingling in my left elbow. It could be a pinched nerve. Noted. Morning. How's the driver doing? Mr. Wyatt should be fine. Suffered a mild concussion, a few cracked ribs. We're just running some more tests. Nurse, more pillows. But that boy... may die. You're my first visitor. - What are you... doing here? - Recovering. Checked myself in this morning. - Recovering from what? - Whiplash from when you tackled me. May wanna contact a lawyer. You never cease to amaze me. Thanks for stopping by, Jo. You made my day. Glad I could help, Fargo. Mr. Wyatt. Please, call me Jake. I hear I owe you one for pulling me outta that crash. Tell you what... you don't sue me, we'll call it even. Do you remember what happened yesterday? I was on my way to the waste repository. I was heading down Euripides drive. I... I must have blacked out. Next thing, I woke up here. Are you on any prescription medication, - sleep aids? - Oh, no, sir. The strongest thing that I ingest is... a cup of coffee in the morning and a pint of beer at night. - You're a man after my own heart. - Not that we don't believe you, but we will need your permission to take a look around your home. Oh, of course, anything I can do to help. I feel terrible about all this. This may seem like an odd question. Do you remember your dreams from last night? No. But they do have me on some pretty heavy pain meds... why? Just curious. You know what? Rest up, get better. If we have more questions, - we'll come back, okay? - I'll be here. Shut up, Fargo. What are you working on? Do you know what it is you're making? It's in my dreams. It's in my dreams, too, Kev. Can you help me understand what it is? How's it going? - Another one, huh? - It's astonishing. No matter what medium I give him, the image is always the same, down to the very last detail. I wish I could see what's going on inside of his head, why this is happening to him. I don't know, Allie, but do not worry. We'll figure this out. Very soon. Nice house. Nice artwork. Looks like Jake has a talent for more than just driving trucks. Well, not many of us get to do what we really want to do. You mean this isn't your dream job? Well, it's certainly not dull, but who are we kidding? It's not... pitching in the big leagues. You ever want to do anything else? Nice family. Yeah, Jake and his wife divorced last year. Oh. That sucks. Guess Jake and I have a few things in common. Same pay grade. G3. A dancer. What's that? I wanted to be a dancer. Really? Really. Wow. What happened? You grow up with three brothers and no mom, uh, you learn to survive. Well... your secret's safe with me. Josefina ballerina. I will taser you. Hey, who's the employer on that check you got over there? GD why? I got a Descartes delivery for 30 hours - last week. - Jake's been moonlighting. Which means he was probably working nights. Maybe he fell asleep at the wheel. Stay with me. All right, stay with me, buddy. Clear! Come on, stay with me. Clear! Okay, shock him again. charge to 400. Clear. Okay, that's it. Time of death, 7:40 AM. I don't understand. You said he'd be fine. With traumatic injuries, it's difficult to see the extent of the damage. And we won't know why he stopped breathing until I've done an autopsy. I'll tell you why. Because he died in the dream. I saw the crash. you tried to save him. Then I felt him slip away. Fargo, that was a dream, and given your accident, it's not surprising. Just to be clear, Fargo didn't have an accident. He avoided an accident. The point is, I dream he dies, a second later, he's flatling. We frequently incorporate external stimuli into our dreams... music, alarm clocks. You probably just heard the EKG, fargo. Hold on. uh... excuse me. What do you think? You think that's what happened? Actually... No. Okay. Any particular reason why? Because I had the exact same dream. So did I. Honey, keep your voice down. Don't tell me what to do. Okay, you wanna run that by me again? Fargo and the head nurse and three residents who sleep in the lounge across the hall all shared the same dream about Jake's death. How can that be? We don't know. But they're not the only ones to share dreams. - We had disturbance calls all morning. - Like what? Get her off me! - Like that. - <i>Honey, it was just a dream.</i> Do you mind? Fine. But you're gonna get the next one. How do you like my husband now? What the heck are you dreaming about? - Okay, what's going on? - We don't know. But we think it's tied to the chemical spill. Okay. Why? Well... before it happened, dreams weren't contagious. - Dreams can't be contagious. - Well, normally, I'd agree with you. But since it's happened to Jo and me and Fargo and a boatload of other people, I'm gonna have to say they can. Now, the crash site was close to a stream. Maybe the spill contaminated the water supply. No, Eureka's water treatment system would have detected it. Unless someone didn't want it to. You're the one who brought up sabotage. All right, I'll have someone look at it while Henry's doing the autopsy. But there is no way that a contagious dream killed Jake Wyatt. It's Eureka. Stranger things have happened. There have been legitimate studies done on shared dreams. So it is possible. Well, to an extent. Subjects focused on the same topic to induce shared dreaming with some success. But... we never had the exact same dream. What you're talking about is unprecedented. And what are you working on here? I'm developing a dream spectrometer. it... it maps the electrical impulse patterns of a person's dreams. Layman's terms, doc. what's the upshot? If dreams were television, this would be the written transcript. - Really? - Yeah. - What's this one about? - I have no idea. A... at this stage, it's kinda like trying to decipher a new language. We're working on it. What about studies related to dreams and death? What about 'em? Is there any evidence that dying in your dream can cause your death in real life? In bad hollywood horror movies, maybe. But in reality, absolutely not. Are you certain? I'd bet my life on it. Kevin, honey, where are you? Kevin, honey, where are you? I'm right here, mom. Why didn't you answer me? you had me worried. I'm sorry, mom. I wanted to show you something. Well, where are we going? It's a secret. Honey, it's late, and I still need to make dinner. It'll only take a minute, I promise. Are you ready? I don't know, Kevin. What's in there? Everything. It worked, honey. It worked. OK, now, who's next? He sold our research and took all the credit! I dreamed of selling, OK? - That doesn't count. - Am I supposed to trust you? Yes, you are. You never trusted... I didn't slander her. You called me a jackass. In front - It was a dream! - of the entire cryogenics team. And I have 20 witnesses who will back me up. I didn't cheat. I swear. You copied my test answers verbatim, now we're both suspended. Well, copying dream answers shouldn't count. It does when the teacher dreamed you stealing them. - <i>It's getting out of hand.</i> - How many more shared dreams? Hundreds. People are getting too freaked out to sleep. - Did the autopsy turn up anything? - The truck driver? Nothing obvious. I mean, he... he just stopped breathing. Let's look at where the dream sharers live. Maybe it's location based. All right. All right, where is the spill? Not even close. Maybe it got into the water supply? No, I did that test myself. There was no presence of CNS stimulants, psychotropics or anything that would explain this. What are we missing? Just checking some readings. We have to stop. OK. Why? Other people are sharing dreams. Allison, we'll be lucky if this works on Kevin, much less anyone else. Did it? - Did it work? - That's not the point. Of course it's the point. We're trying to figure out Kevin's connection to the artifact. You said you would give anything to know what's going on inside his head. I've spent months trying to give that to you. Did it work? Yes. There has to be some connection among these people. Or a disconnection. What? No dreams were shared in here. Where is that? Now, here's your double-double no-foam Sumatran latte. Now, that should keep you awake for a while. Vincent. Sheriff. Have you had any... odd dream experiences in the last couple of days? Sadly, no. I seem to be missing out on all the fun. Believe me, it's not so much fun. Where do you sleep? Upstairs in the loft. I like to be close in case I get the midnight urge to baste something. Could we book your cafe for the night? Sure. You having a party? More of a sleepover. We were here in your lab. And he was just this normal kid, happy and excited. And he wanted to show me something in the back. What was it? I don't know. It was like a vault. I woke up before we had a chance to go inside. But... when I asked him, he said... it was everything. I think he might be right. I don't understand. For centuries, we've been searching for a unifying theory of everything. A zero-point energy field containing all... knowledge and experience from the beginning of time. You're talking about the akashic field. Yes. And I think... the artifact is the antenna for that field. Are you saying that Kevin... of all the people exposed to the artifact explosion, his was the only system that didn't overload. And his brain is wired like no one else's. Somehow, I think he's... created a connection to the field... that the rest of us can't. What am I supposed to do now? Let Kevin show you what's inside the vault. Head to toe, people. Head to toe. And, yes, we still have space behind the counter. Man, she's good. So, Jack, I'm still not clear what your little experiment is meant to accomplish. We know that Cafe Diem is a dream-free zone. Everybody gathered here has been sharing dreams. So we're gonna test whether it's the place or the people. OK, so either everyone will finally get a good night's sleep or we could share the most horrifying dream experience ever. Yes. All right, Sheriff. We've maximixed the potential of our space. Good. Glad you're on that. All right, people. Lights out. What? No story? Don't make me come over there. You really wanna add police brutality to the list? Just go to sleep, Fargo. I love watching him sleep. He seems like just... any other normal kid. Would you really want him to be like any other normal kid? Sometimes. There's nothing wrong with that. Then why do I feel so guilty about it? You want what's best for your son. We both do. Do we really? I don't know, I... I think you're still fixated on the artifact and your theory of everything. And I think... that I just want the feeling that I had last night. In Kevin's dream, we were so connected, so normal. He's always been so... different and brilliant. And for the most part, I love that about him. But... different is hard. Brilliant is hard. Hell, normal is hard. And with everything else that... So what do you want to do now, Allie? I want to protect my son. - Me too. - But not at the risk of everyone else. We have to stop. Now, we have to tell Carter. Allison, listen to me. Whatever is happening in this town, that signal is not the cause. Then turn it off, and tomorrow we'll know. No. - I've made up my mind. - So have I. Hi, guys. - Kinda busy. - Yeah... I need to talk to Allison. About what? About this. Way to cut to the chase, Sheriff. Direct, focused, efficient. Kudos. Oh, dear. That approach lacked confidence. It was too tentative. No woman likes that. - True. - Shocker. Try it again, this time with confidence. Hold her face with one hand. Pull her in closely with the other. The goal is efficiency of movement to achieve maximum results. I think... we may have different goals. I'll make it easy for you. Oh, my god. Madre de dios! - Could have been anyone's dream. - Right. Well, actually, he's got a point. Oh, and I suppose that that whole kissing mess wasn't Carter's dream either. Hey, it wasn't a mess. - Actually... - Nobody's asking you. Or you. All right. So we've ruled out the waste, the water, and the location. It's gotta be us. We're gonna have to start testing people as soon as possible All right, everybody. We're moving to Global. Dad, this woman won't wake up. Sheriff, this one's out too. I've got one over here. Unconscious... we must get them to the infirmary. Collect your stuff in an orderly fashion. We're gonna move out to Global as quick as we can. Go! Thanks, I got it. - Put the pressure on... - That couldn't have hurt any more. Tell me you found something. I went back and reviewed the autopsy and discovered that Jake Wyatt had abnormally levels of acetylcholine in his spinal fluid. - Which is... - A neural transmitter. A chemical that allows your neurons to communicate and your muscles to flex and is essential to dreaming. So the dream did kill him. No. But elevated levels have a devastating effect on neural function and ultimately lead to the loss of muscle control. In this case, his diaphragm. He suffocated in his sleep. - I think I know where it's going. - That's right. All the latest victims have high levels... including you. And those levels are rising. Let's work a little faster. Joe, I'm gonna go talk to Paul Suenos. Even if you could share dreams, it wouldn't cause you to slip into a coma. Six more people are unconscious, and a lot of others are headed in that direction, including me. Okay. What can I do? First, we've to separate the dreamers from the dreamees. If I hook people up to my spectrometer, we might see... a difference in brain activity during rem sleep. The dreamers would likely experience more than the watchers. Good. Good... We talk about hundreds of people. Considering I only have two protypes, that could take weeks. You have two of these things? - Where's the other one? - It's right in here. It's gone. Told her to get a nanny cam. Thanks. - I need to talk to you. - Yeah, me too. Look, I know what's causing the shared dreams, and you have to... stay calm. It's the music thing that Stark put in Kevin's room. I know. - You know? - I should have told you sooner. Yeah, you should have told me. You protect Stark instead of the town? No, I told him to turn it off last night. He was just trying to help me. - Help you what? - To protect Kevin. To understand what's going on in his head. And it worked. Well, that's great. You put yourself first, and a man died. - Not from what we put in that room. - You lied. You lied to me! I know, and I'm sorry! Something is happening to Kevin. He is changing. And it terrifies me. You tell me you wouldn't do the same if it was Zoe. I think it's time to get Stark to explain what the hell he did. Don't you? The receiver I adapted from Suenos's device visually interprets electrical impulses created during rem sleep. So why is it messing with our acetamophen levels? - Acetylcholine. - Don't push me. There's no reason it would affect one person, much less half the town. How many people show elevated levels? 50 total. 50 even? Yeah. So? Jo, you were taking the dream statements? Yeah. I had around 50 different dreams that were shared by everyone else. Well, they're the sources of the dreams. - That's why their levels are so high. - What do we know about these 50 people? But my name isn't on there. That's a good thing. I know, because it means I wasn't the one who had the man in black dream. Well, it sure as hell wasn't me. Oh, god. Focus. Jake, you me, we're all on the list, right? So we're searching his house. What did we find we had in common? None of us realized our full potential? Yes. But we're also the same pay grade. G3. Can you run this list and tell me who else is G3? All of you. So 50 people, same pay grade. All with crank levels of Acetylcholine. Thanks. That's gotta mean something. G3 refers to work schedule, not pay level. All the jobs have set hours, so overtime doesn't compromise safety or security. Like truck drivers. Yes. Or reactor technicians, weapon test specialists... network engineers. The... network. What about it? Childress was saying she was working on some sort of neural network? Yeah. She's beta testing a system of distributed computing with humans. Okay. But given that Stark's dream receiver isn't powerful enough to caused shared dreaming, could the neural network be used as an amplifier? It's possible. We should shut it down. - Do it fast. - You're not coming? I would... but I can't move my legs. We'll take care of her. don't worry. You should go with the others. I'd rather stay with you, if you don't mind. No. No, I don't mind. We all sleep a third of our lives away. I figured why not find a way to use our brains during our down time? Yeah, sure, why not? I created a wireless network of test subjects with regular sleep schedules. Yeah. G3 employees. Yeah. See, everyone's brainwaves have a distinct signature. Theirs are programmed in the network, so when they're asleep, I can tap into their minds from this computer, use the combined power to problem solve. Wait a second. You're taking people's brain power? No, Sheriff. Just tapping into unused potential. And it's in everyone's contract that they may be randomly selected for double blind case studies from time to time. I told you to read your contract carefully before you signed it. And I'm guessing you've randomly tapped into, say, 50 of them? Exactly. They're essentially wireless transmitters. And everything we dreamed has been networked to everyone else. - It doesn't work that way. - Not by itself. But in combination with Dr. Stark's dream device, maybe. But why the sudden buildup of acetylcholine? Probably lack of sleep. The people were selected based on the regularity of sleep patterns. But Jake's been secretly doing double shifts, and no one in town's been sleeping normally this week. We'll shut down the network immediately. That won't solve the buildup of acetylcholine in the test subjects. Their bodies are overproducing the compound like a hyperactive gland. Clean the system of the compound, it may reset the body's rate of production. Okay, good. Let's do that. The excess neurotransmitters are acting like toxins in your body, and I have no idea how we scrub that out. So GD has the most advanced waste reduction system in the world, but we can't clean this out of us? Maybe we can. You gotta be kidding me. It's an oxygenation filtration system. It should remove the excess acetylcholine from your system. In theory. In theory. Once you're inside, we'll flood the chamber with an oxygen-rich plasma. It's gonna take a moment to adjust. You have to breathe the fluid into your lungs, but the chemical reaction will do the rest. And if it doesn't? You'll drown. Well, this just gets better and better. Just breathe in, Carter, slow and easy. You've got to take the fluid into your lungs. - We have to get him out of there. - Wait. Nathan, he's going to drown! Come on, Carter. His acetylcholine levels are dropping. Oxygen's on the rise. He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be fine. And we have a cure. Which means we can keep moving forward with our research. Let's get everyone up here and get them in treatment as soon as possible. Morning, Henry. Hey, Jack, how you feeling? I got a total body enema. Thank you for that... very vivid image. Actually, I'm just glad to have my dreams back to myself. Think a lot of people feel the same way. Those were some disturbing images, huh? Yes, that one of your... birthmark is particularly haunting. You know, there was... one that was so familiar, it was like <i>deja vu</i>. Uh, you, me, and we're in the garage. And you said... "i'll make it easy for you." and... there was a big flash of light. I don't know. I don't know. Dreams are funny that way.
