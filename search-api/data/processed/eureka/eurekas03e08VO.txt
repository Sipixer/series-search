Too late. Thorne dug up an old bomb-testing facility? - What's down there anyway? - Nothing for long, she ordered a thermal cleaning. She redacted all the photos of Eureka's founders. - Oh, my God, are those... - Bodies? History has a way of haunting you. This is part of mine, and I'm putting it to rest, so you stay outta my way. So... Party at Pilar's tonight? Doubtful. My morning shift felt like a double. In fact, I'm about as energetic as this dish rag. Which is why you need some fun. Get up. I'll just... I will just sit here till you are finished. Why do dads ruin everything? 'Cause they're men, and men are ruiners. Zane drama? Fear. Okay, never date a coward. I put myself out there, commitment-wise, and he froze. - We haven't talked since. - Well, here's your chance. Hey, Jo. You... eat yet? I thought maybe we could, you know, we could have a bite. A bite. Well, we wouldn't want you to commit to a whole meal. - You got something to say? - I already did. And you couldn't handle it. Hi, ruiner. You know, if we're ever gonna find out why Thorne moved those bodies, - we'll have to search the bunker. - Stopping a thermal cleaning didn't slow her down. She's pulled in an outside contractor. What kind of outside contractor? I'm not sure. His name is Hendrix. He's set himself up in a trailer near the bunker. That's all I could find out. But I know he has something to do with what she's trying to hide. And she's moving those bodies. We have to autopsy those bodies in order to discover - their cause of death and ID. - ID'ing them is gonna be difficult. She's redacted every personnel record and photo from 1939, even the ones that were on that wall. Why would anybody want photos of scientists and founders of Eureka? Yeah, I mean, somebody on that wall's gotta be part of the answer. Well, we're never gonna know without those photos. Or a... photo of a photo. Hey, Vince. Remember the day of the speeches? You took photos in front of that wall. Yeah, you mean the ones where I look like sasquatch? - Yes! Those are the ones. - Thanks. I think Fargo has them. Great. Okay. I'll talk to Fargo. Jo'll check on Thorne's guy. And, Allison, we have to have those bodies. Okay. All right, Dr. Hendrix, you sure you have enough material? Trust me, Miss Thorne. I'm very good at what I do. That's why I called you in. - How long before everything's in place? - As long as it takes. This bunker is massive, and you don't wanna make a mistake with this stuff. Fine, but we need this completed as soon as possible. I'll be happy to give you any help you need. This is a delicate operation. I would prefer to do it myself. We only have one shot. Take it quickly. Dr. Hendrix, it's the police. I need to speak with you. Thanks, Carter. That was pointless. Found you. How'd you get here? I rode my bike. And so you know, this passive-aggressive thing is really annoying. You wanna try just aggressive? No. Not really. I didn't think so. See ya. Could you come here for a second? Why? So you can hit me with that? Well, not until you tell me what it is first. Please? Anodized aluminum with a trap valve. Okay. And that means... It's a pressurized container of some kind. It's got a remote trigger. For what? To set it off at a distance. You wouldn't want to be anywhere near this when it went off. You could pack a hell of a lot of something in a device like this. How much could you pack in about a thousand of them? Some of us actually work for a living, you know. Yeah, I didn't wanna do this on the GD system. You owe me a lunch hour. And you mind turning around? I have some personal photos on here. Oh, yeah, sure. All right, let's see. Not it. Not it. Not it. - Definitely not it. - That's a good one. What about personal don't you understand? All right. Okay, here we go. Great. Can you zoom in on the photos in the background? Not on this dinosaur. And since I can't do it at GD, I'll have to do it when I get home later tonight. Fargo, this is important. You're gonna have to go home now. Dr. Blake won't like me bending the rules like this. Ah, you'd... be surprised. Oh, great. Ms. Thorne wanted me to double check the delivery address on the shipment from the morgue. One sec. Great. Thanks. I'll never make fun of aunt Lexi again. I feel like I'm pregnant with twins. Oh, don't ever say the "p" word in front of your dad. He'll lock me up and throw away the key. I feel like he's always watching me. If I weren't so tired, I'd tell you stop being so paranoid. Unidentified intruder. See? Always watching. Initiating detention procedure. Season 3 Episode 08 From Fear to Eternity (v 1.00) Sadgeezer & Team Projet-SG. SARAH, turn off security right now. I can't, Sheriff. The intruder is an imposter, not Zoe Carter.</i> Zoe and I walked in and SARAH went insane. Because the unidentified intruder is not Zoe.</i> System off! Manual override engaged. - Honey, you okay? - I think so. Did you set a trap for Lucas? No. There's just something wrong with SARAH. Yeah, what's wrong is living in a house that can taser you. No, she didn't hurt me. I just got really dizzy. - You should go to the infirmary. - No, dad, really, I'm fine. I've just been run down. It's no big deal. Is SARAH dead? No, we just powered her down. Fargo's gonna run a full system check. And Zoe and I are gonna go to Café Diem till he figures out why she turned on us. Okay. You sure you're okay? - You sure you didn't zap my boyfriend? - She's fine. Nice job getting those bodies out of GD. You know Eva's gonna be able to track your ID off that scanner. Which is why we need to hurry. All right, let's find out about our friends. You all right? Since when are you the squeamish sort? I'm not, I'm just... I'm just worn out. Really, I'm fine. Let's just get started. That one's almost empty, but I was able to analyze the leakage around the nozzle. It's some kind of cement. Well, so you know what Hendrix is doing with about a thousand of 'em? No idea. Why don't you ask him? While you're at it, find out why it has a remote trigger. There's also a manual release. I see that. I'm stuck. Yeah. We're stuck. Together. - I'll find Hendrix. - Thank you. Perfect. Busy day? Yeah, yeah. There's not much time to talk. - I'm sorry, who are you? - Oh, Sheriff Carter. I thought access down here from the highway was supposed to be blocked. Yeah, I had to take the scenic route. Okay. Is there something I can help you with, Sheriff? Well, it's just that I don't know you, and you've... you've closed down a road, and you've got a ton of this freakish instant cement, so... This is an authorized military operation. Yes, I know, authorized by Eva Thorne. I know. Look, you seem like a really nice guy, but I can't tell you anything. - Fair enough. - How 'bout I tell you things then? There's an abandoned underground facility. You're loading in about a thousand canisters of that stuff, and all with America's sweetheart behind it. You're very perceptive. She's a piece of work, that one. But I think she's gonna take a few pieces outta me - if I tell you what I'm doing. - Okay. Could you tell me when you're gonna be done doin' it? When is the road gonna be clear? I think we'll be done end of work day tomorrow. Great. Thanks. Oh... one more thing. What if someone made the very understandable mistake of opening one of the canisters... And then someone else got their feet caught in your super goo? It's called Instantanium. It's a nano-polymer syntactic foam. You know what that means? Well, no. But how do we get 'em out? You get a saw. - Great. So you can just cut through it. - No. You cut through their legs. Yes. Son of a... Don't you look at me in that tone of voice. - This isn't my fault. - Okay. Dr. Bonehead's lab. Let me guess... you two are still stuck together. Just till I can reach my gun. What'd you find out from Hendrix? It's called Instantanium, some sort of hardening foam. No... nano... lastic foam. - Nano-polymer syntactic foam? - Yes! What, wow? Nanoparticles are bound together at a molecular level. Did Hendrix have any idea how to get out of it? One, but you're not gonna want to try it. I've slept in tee-pees, huts, yurts... I'd take a bed of nails right now. Okay, I know why I'm tired. I'm sleeping for the boys. What's your excuse? I think I'm coming down with something. Every bone in my body aches. Is this what it feels like to be 30? Okay, I'll forgive you for that in 15 years. You do look a little pale. Smart house is up and running. Everything's fine. For the house that occasionally takes you hostage? Honest mistake. Zoe's DNA didn't match the sample on SARAH's database. It's not like I went out and changed it. Well, maybe it was a memory glitch. Either way, I reset her, and it won't happen again. - So we get to sleep in real beds now? - Yep. - With real pillows? - You're all set for the house. And tell your dad it took me a while to enhance them, but I am a photoshop God, so I got those old pictures he wanted. I love old pictures. The Sheriff was interested in which ones? - The ones on the wall... - Of my grandfather's house. He has this one with Mickey Mantle, and I promised I'd get it restored, so... Thanks, Fargo. - I'll pick 'em up later. - Okeydokey. - So can I buy you some ice cream? - I'm pressed for time now. Oh, you're checking on that Hendrix guy down in the bunker. That's a big job you gave him. - Classified. - That's what he said. He said it's some part of some big military project. - That's right. - I checked with Mansfield, and he said - that it isn't a big military project. - You spoke to the General? He doesn't take my calls, but I used your name, and he picked right up. It was awesome. I hope you don't mind. I mind just about everything you do, especially when you stick your nose into somebody else's business. Well, dead bodies are always my business. The General says hi, and he can't wait to be briefed about the underground facility. - Seems he didn't know a thing about it. - Well, apparently, he does now. Yeah. I'm just looking for the truth. Sometimes the truth needs to be left alone. But you've made that impossible now, haven't you, Sheriff? Yes, I have. - Henry, tell me you found something. - Yeah, I found something all right. These men did not die of natural causes. Awesome! - Not for them... - Definitely not for them. Their death was accelerated brutally. Rapid aging. Every cell in their body went through an entire life cycle in a compressed period of time. Something was introduced to their system that killed them in a month. - You think they were poisoned? - Could be. I don't know. I'm trying to identify the elemental base of the pathogen. It's something I've never seen before. Look at that... 40 to 90 in a month. Now, does that look natural to you? If you can prove that they didn't die of natural causes, I can investigate. And if I can investigate, then I can stop Thorne from sealing the bunker. - I can try. - All right. God, what if I have to go to the bathroom? Why do you think I'm working so fast? I had four cups of coffee this morning. This isn't so bad. Hey, guys. You got a china pattern yet? No, hold on. I need Jo for a second. I'm kinda busy right now, and that means that... My job is less important than yours? Well, that depends. Can you do it with one leg? Good times. I have an array of exotic flavors for you to choose from.</i> I chose them specifically based on the regions you've traveled.</i> The fact that a house can actually try to suck up to me is almost as disturbing as a house taking my niece hostage. I'm still indicating that her DNA has changed.</i> Aunt Lexi? Great. Just when she's finally getting some sleep. Yeah? Here. Aunt Lexi, are you there? Yeah, I'm right here. Are you okay? There's something wrong with my eyes. I can't see. All clear. No one left inside. Good. You really know how to work a man. So I've been told. Everything set? This place will be an instantanium fortress... Every entrance 5 feet thick with the stuff. Now, the facility itself will stay clear like you asked. With you rushing me, though, I can't promise a smooth detonation. Meaning? Look, an underground job like this needs to be calibrated precisely so the geological foundation of the place isn't disturbed. Now moving the operation a day up on me... You might feel a few little quakes. You sure it'll be impossible to reopen once it's triggered? Nothing breaks my Instantanium. Thank you, Dr. Hendrix. I'll take it from here. - Well, you're not going back in there. - I have a few things to take care of. Okay, but once this goes, anything still in there is never gettin' out. If Hendrix seals the facility before we get a warrant, we're screwed. It's a big place. There's gotta be a weak spot. ... can I just get my... ... so if we find out where it is and protect it... - We can get in later. - Can we just... Okay, take a closer look right over here, right? There's an air shaft just there. I think it goes down to the second level. Cataracts... easy to get rid of nowadays especially with our prototype. She's gonna be as good as new. You're gonna be able to see again soon. - How did this happen? - SARAH's lasers. Really bad for the eyes. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Sure. It wasn't lasers, Henry. You get cataracts when you're old, not when you're 17. Yes. Tell me it doesn't have anything to do with how those three men died. SARAH was right. Zoe's DNA has changed. Every cell in her body is beginning to age rapidly. Now, if she has the same thing as those men, there's one place she could have gotten it. - The bunker. - Yes. Okay... She hurt her ankle when she was there. She slipped in some purple liquid. - Could that be it? - I need a sample. I'll get you a sample. You stay? Sure, listen, GD's done a lot of work on arresting cell degeneration. I've even put a team together. So try not to worry. Yeah. - That picture... - Not now. No, no, you need to see this. That's impossible. Well, sometimes impossible answers a lot of questions. Don't... touch the pretty metal canisters. Sheriff? You need to get out of here now. Sure. - If you tell me what's going on. - What? That stuff you're trying to hide... it killed those three men, - and now Zoe's been exposed. - That's not possible. She slipped in it when she was lost down here. Now it's changed her DNA. My God. If that's true, we've gotta get out of here as fast as we can. Nice... try. But I spoke to Hendrix. He's not sealing this place until tomorrow. No, no! You called Mansfield. I had it accelerated. We've gotta get to the air shaft! That was our only way out. Crap. So you knew this was gonna happen. Why are you down here? I wanted to end it. All of it. Including me. I should have done it a long time ago, but I didn't have the courage. What are you talking about? Courage to... What? To... to... Courage... To cover up how those men died. Yeah. - What did you do to them? - I didn't do anything to them. They died 70 years ago. I wasn't even born. Well... Try again. This is one of the pictures you took out of Café Diem... That's you. You were here in 1939 with them. I was. But I didn't hurt them. I just couldn't help them. So... I'm 107 years old. Why didn't you die like them? I don't know. I'm the only one. Well, now you have a chance to fix this. I mean, Zoe's not lucky like you. She's like them, and she's gonna suffer unless you tell me everything you know! I know, but we're stuck here. Well, I'm not dead yet, and neither are you. So we're gonna find a way. We're not letting Zoe die. Here ya go. Good eats in this town. Glad you think so. You'll be staying a while longer. We set off the first atomic bomb here. No, first atomic bomb was... Los Alamos? They learned from our mistakes and went with plutonium. We used a rare element found only in certain meteorites. The first test was flawless. But it created a certain... unique by-product in the blast chamber. The purple stuff. The... the stuff Henry couldn't identify. Element x. They asked the team to study it. There were only four of us exposed. But nobody knew its effects until it was too late. So... why did they age and you didn't? DNA hadn't even been discovered yet. But Jimmy knew that, genetically, I was one in a million. Sorry. Jimmy is... Perkins. He was the team leader. Along with Blackman and Ross. - And you. - Well, I was a lab assistant. The best a girl could hope for in those days. But Jimmy insisted that I keep my exposure a secret... - I wouldn't have to do what they did. - Bury themselves down here. Yes. They locked it all away. The element. The whole project. And they were so close to a cure. - How do you know that? - I read their paperwork. They worked on it every day for the rest of their lives. 28 days. 28 days? Zoe was exposed to this stuff seven days ago. This place is amazing. You got the right dissolving chain here, but you're gonna need francium 227AC, and there's less than an ounce of that on Earth. Yeah, except for the stash here at GD. You're kidding, right? I'll order it up. But we'll only be able to make up a few milligrams. We're getting a series of small earthquakes around the underground facility. Any idea why? Hey, I told her that would happen if she rushed the job. - You mean you've already sealed it? - Yeah, about an hour ago. Oh, Carter... I put all their papers in here. - What am I looking for? - Notes, papers, journals. Anything that can help Henry save Zoe. Hitler was already marching across europe. Imagine if he'd gotten his hands on our bomb research. Oh, there'd be Volkswagens everywhere. So why come back? Why not just keep it all hidden? I tried to move on, have a life. But things changed for women. I made something of myself. Fate catches up with you... no matter how far you run. I did so well, I became the best person for the job at GD. I've spent a lifetime trying to forget this place. I needed to know. Because your name isn't Eva Thorne. It's Mary Perkins. Jimmy was my brother. If I had known that Zoe would have found her way down here, I never would have opened this place up again. Don't worry about it. We're gonna help her. Well, even if we find the cure, we can't get out of here. Well, you believed in your team. I believe in mine. So next step, we need some of that liquid. Well, there's a storage pool in the cooling chamber. - Great. - Follow me. This solvent might work. Just FYI... there's a chance of a slight explosion. No, wait... Explosion? Just do it. - Thank God! - Oh, look, it worked. You're free! Yes, in another five minutes, I would have chewed off my own leg! Your mouth is probably big enough. - How much longer, Fargo? - The bunker's computers are 70. It's like teaching Lincoln how to use an iPhone. Get us a signal down there. We need to know if Carter's okay. Easier said than done. How's Zoe? Tired, but stable. I was able to identify the DNA marker that that purple element affects. I just need more of it so that I can test a reversal process. There's gonna come a point of no return, her body won't be able to bounce back from whatever aging she's already experienced. Henry, listen, I have been feeling exhausted, not your normal kind of tired. - I was down there, too, you know. - Well, then, I want you tested. This room would have been buried if you hadn't cut the wire. Yeah. What is all this stuff anyway? It was too dangerous to enter the cooling chamber. So we had a video system installed to monitor the liquid level. We were working with atom bombs for the first time, so we didn't want the radiation to seep into the groundwater. Is this the storage pool? Yes. It looks like the Instantanium's has cracked the base of the storage pool. It's leaking out. If it reaches the groundwater and gets into the Eureka drinking system... Eureka's gonna get very old... very fast. Even if we do make it out of here, Henry doesn't have any purple stuff to make a cure. We need to save your daughter. Yes. We do. I've had this for a long time. My brother thought I might need it one day. Zoe needs it more. What about you? I'd rather save somebody now than hold onto it for a lifetime. We have to figure out how to get it outta here. Look, I know this was a rush job, but I did seal the entire facility. Well, every fortified position has its weak point. I'm thinking yours is down at the bottom of that ventilation shaft. You might know that, but how does Carter know that? We looked at the same schematic. When two people really know each other, then they're in sync, - and when they're partners... - I get it. Could you just drive the car, please? I can't believe this shaft was here the whole time. Yeah, labeled on every map as a capped well. - Why are we still in this room? - I think it's our best bet. No offense, Sheriff, but nobody has any idea what's going on down here. Lupo and I looked at the same plans. We identified the same weak points, and this was the weakest. That's why you tried to clear all the canisters in this room. Yeah, but I missed one. And now there's only one thing between us and the air shaft. One canister or not, that material's invulnerable. So everyone keeps telling me. Do you... hear something? Good afternoon! My name is Joe Lupo, and I'll be saving your ass today. Someone oughta promote you. So how is she? She's hanging in there. Henry's pulled up half the departments at GD. - And Eva's doing everything she can. - Great. The solution that Henry's working on... we're all gonna need it soon. So it made it into the groundwater? Our monitors registered contamination in over a million acre-feet of the aquifer. You're lucky you don't have a boss. Otherwise, he'd come down here, he'd kick your... Allison Blake. - Where is she? - Eva Thorne is currently aiding Dr. Deacon in trying to get a dangerous situation under control. You said eva Thorne is the dangerous situation with bodies, and underground facilities, and cover-ups. Yeah, sir, the situation has changed since I called you. Yes. It's gotten worse. You've allowed a breach of security in a deactivated facility turn into a potential town-wide catastrophe. General, Sheriff Carter is in no way responsible for this situation. No, Thorne is. I want you to arrest her. Sir, it's imperative the testing of Thorne continue. Well, you can test her after she's been arraigned. Sir, on a personal note, my daughter was exposed to whatever stuff that is down there, and the testing can help her. But we have to do it now. All right. When this is over, Thorne belongs to me. Thank you. We're hoping to create a counter-reaction using non-baryogenic radiation to counter the baryogenic radiation that she was exposed to. It's... like using x-rays to treat cancer. It'll work. It has to. Well... we'll know in a few hours. If it does work, how long will it take you to make enough for the whole town? I can't. It took all of Thorne's sample just to make enough for Zoe. I know my brother would have been working right up to the end trying to find a way to neutralize the element. All I can find here are designs for some kind of a bomb... a big bomb. They spent their last days working on a doomsday weapon? Not my brother. He was looking for a solution. Maybe the bomb was the solution. Does it say anywhere that the bomb created a lot of non... - bary... - Non-baryogenic radiation? - Yes. - Yeah, they were talking 20, 30 kilotons. That's enough to irradiate ten square miles. Could that fix the town? A range like that would certainly reach the aquifer. I mean, it might work. Sure, if they actually built the thing. It doesn't say how far they got. Well, they had a month. They wouldn't have wasted the time. Sure this is the right room? The only peak on our particle scan is located 12 feet directly behind you. Signal's hot. I think I'm close. - Is there anything down there? - Yep. A really big bomb. - <i>So how far did they get?</i> - Pretty far. Time to finish what they started. Give me a couple hours and I'll let you know.</i> All right, baby, all you have to do is neutralize a radioactive water table and we are good. The bomb's primed and ready to go. It's hot-wired into the timing circuits down here. - <i>Great work, Zane.</i> - That wasn't me. It was all Jimmy. It's set up so you can start the countdown remotely. As soon as you're clear. Okay. Just got one more thing to do. We've evacuated the area above the facility. You sure there's enough Instantanium to handle a nuclear blast? 'Cause if it shatters, all the force will go up, not down. - It'll never reach the aquifer. - But it will reach us. Look, I told you I double-covered that area. Your little firecracker won't even make a dent. It's fascinating, you know. You've created a problem so big the solution is to detonate an atomic bomb. I know, right? How cool is that? Should I... come with you guys? Automated countdown sequence initiated.</i> Detonation in... Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Zero. The sensor's into the water table. It'll take a few seconds to get the reading. And let us know if we're all gonna die. Pretty much. - Well, no matter how it turns out... - It's been a fun day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I guess it was. Oh, nice to end the relationship on a high note. So what's the verdict? The explosion's completely neutralized the baryogenic radiation in the aquifer. The groundwater's safe. Well, good for us. I... I should... call Allison. Yeah. After that call, if you... maybe wanna go for a... you know, break-up dinner? No. How'bout a... a make-up dinner instead? Guess it's not so bad being stuck together. Allison Blake, please. I'm really glad I came to stay here. And I'm glad uncle Jack is gonna be around for the boys. Me too. If you guys hug, I know I'm dead. Well... hi, lazy. How you feeling? 17, I hope. Well, we have that Thorne lady to thank for that. I came here thinking I couldn't trust anyone. Boy, was I wrong. - I wish I could have done more. - You made sure that nobody would have to go through what my brother went through... that's enough. And I still wanna work on a cure for you. It worked for Zoe. That's what's important. And I can leave here thinking about my future instead of my past. That's quite a gift. - Where will you go? - I'm quite a resourceful gal. Whoever I become next, I'll be well taken care of. Good-bye, Henry. Thank you for giving me a new life. Are you sure that Mansfield doesn't know that we have the remains? I convinced him that Thorne destroyed them down in the bunker, along with most of their research, and I promised Eva that I would lay them to rest. We are laying it all to rest. Henry, I... I've been kind of afraid to ask you this, but was I... Exposed? No. Oh, no. Oh, okay. - No, the results came back negative. - Good. I just... I guess I just need some rest. Although... I did find something else. So... party at Pilar's tonight? You sure you're feeling up to it? I'm feeling up to a lot of things. Good thought to hold onto. I'm not gonna look. I'm... I'm not gonna look, okay? Yeah. I shouldn't have looked. You're a good dad. Well, I don't know. Glad things are back to normal. You know, as normal as they get. Getting excited about being an uncle? Yeah, I guess. I... you know, never really had boys around. Well, they'll need a role model. True. I can finally coach little league. You would be a great coach. I was kinda hoping, you'd be mine. Okay. You gonna... take up t-ball, or... No, my... my birthing coach. I'm pregnant. How? - The usual way. - I got the... drill. - Wow, so... so it's... - Nathan's. You okay? Oh, General Mansfield. You sure don't make my job easy, do you, Carter? - Where's Thorne? - General, I can explain. Dr. Blake, I have no evidence that you've been insubordinate. Don't give me any. Uh, sir... she's not so much a fugitive as a victim, and... Your job is to enforce the law, not to make judgments. - Yes, sir. - You're a good man, but you disobeyed a direct order, and this time, I can't look the other way.
