how much longer? There are people trying to sleep. Only 2 more to go. These probably date back to the '50s. Don't make 'em like this anymore. Which is why we're replacing them. It's an out-of-date design. Just like your haircut. What is that? I don't know. I thought this one was empty. It's supposed to be. No way. - Did you get it? - Yeah. Hand it over. Come on, come on, come on. Double shot vin-spresso. Do not tell him. Not if he tortured me. Nice try. Dad, come on. No, a dozen. Long. Long-stemmed. Okay, thanks. - Who are the flowers for? - None of your business. This... Is Vincent's coffee. Vincent knows not to supply... You. You have a middleman. You'll never break me. "Sassy pumps for fall." I'm so ashamed. Dealing to minors. Coffee's not a drug, Dad. Then, you can quit whenever you want, no driving lessons until you do. - But... - Ah. No buts. I love you too much to watch you... do this to yourself. Sure. It's Allison. Jack Carter. Oh, hey. It's me. Yeah. Okay... Well, we have a bit of an unusual situation up here. Oh, at Global Dynamics? Imagine. Well, this one's unprecedented, even for us. What do you want me to do... Evacuate the town? Okay, I get it. You're still mad at me. How long are you gonna punish me for this? I'm just trying to do my job. I'll be there shortly. What was that about? Nothing... Gotta go. We'll talk consequences later. - Can't wait. - Can't wait. He broke me like a stick. Which will make revenge that much sweeter. He left his cell phone. What are you gonna do? I don't know... Getting as much coffee and driving lessons as I want. Hi, yes. I'm calling for my boss, Jack Carter. I believe he just ordered flowers. Right, well, I just needed to verify the spelling of the name? Okay. Yeah, that's... That's right. Thank you. Who the hell is Angela Fairfield? Okay, Carter. Can we talk about this? I don't... I don't know what to say. I mean, you withheld information that Stark's device could be causing the shared dreaming. I apologized for that. Allison, I'm just gonna be mad for a while. Okay? Okay. So, what's the emergency? We're updating the equipment in cryogenics. Thank god. A number of people have elected to go into cryostasis over the years, going back to the 1950s. Cryostasis? Cold stored? To be revived at a later date, ideally after we found the cure for whatever disease they were dying from. Creepy, yes. But I don't think that falls under my jurisdiction. Well, we discovered a person in an unmarked chamber, a very old chamber. Okay, so GD put some food in the freezer without labeling it, now it's mystery meat. Seems like an internal problem. There's a little more to it than that, Carter. Like, the fact that this one has a heartbeat. What's he doing here? Nathan's early research was in cryogenics. - Of course it was. - How's it going? We are monitoring the defrost rate. Opening the chambers too quickly could destabilize his tissues. I can't believe this is happening in my lifetime... - Right here, right now. - Fargo, don't hurt yourself. No, you don't understand. This is history in the making. The first person ever to come out of cryostasis alive. His pulse is dropping. We gotta get him out of there. I need all medical personnel standing by. - Ready to make history? - Hit it. - Why is he standing backwards? - why is he fully clothed? His pulse is slow, but stable. His vital signs look strong. Okay, get him out of there. Gently. Ready? Lift him up. We need to get him up to the infirmary. Hold on. Pierre Fargo. Grampa? The Projet-SG Team presents: Timing:   Golgi, Linwelin, Moochie, Ricana. Transcript:   swsub.com Edition:   Golgi, Linwelin, Moochie, Ricana. Proofreading:   Golgi, Linwelin. - Season 2 | Episode 7 - Family Reunion (v. 1.0) All my life, I thought he ran out on my grandma, and he's been right here all along. Of all the people to bring out of cryostasis, I resurrect another Fargo. Karma's a bitch. Is anyone curious as to how he got in there? He's a Fargo. Are you really surprised? I am standing right here. He just twitched. I think he might've heard you. Belle... I'm Allison Blake. Do you know your name? Everyone knows my name. I'm Pierre Fargo. The Pierre Fargo. Do you know the date, Pierre? I prefer Dr. Fargo, thank you. And yes, it's august 30th, 1957. Did I hit my head or something? You're at Global Dynamics. You've... been asleep for a while. Does anyone know the time? Because my girl Belle and I have dinner plans, and I can't be late. I don't know how to say this... You're already late. Like 50 years late. - Excuse me? - Pierre... You just woke up from cryostasis. Sure I did. I know this may be difficult to process... But you've been in cryostasis since 1957. The year is 2007. No way you're convincing me that I just woke up 50 years in the future. Put your glasses on. Okay. That's better. Do I know you? I'm Douglas Fargo. I'm your grandson. Imagine waking up and everything you know is gone. Nathan's gonna keep him under observation until we're sure that he's stabilized. Cryogenics to babysitting? - Sheriff Carter? - Yeah. How you doing? Um, better than my granddad. Listen, I know Fargos have a reputation for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but if he says he doesn't know how he got into that chamber, I believe him. Maybe somebody put him in there. The same way somebody put you into the force field bubble? Okay, fair point. But we're not talking about me. Fargos may be cursed, but we're honest. Will you please just look into it? I'll personally put someone on that right away. I'm sorry, is... Is my working disturbing your reading? No. So does Allison know? About? The woman you're sending flowers to. It's none of Allison's business, nor do I think she would care. Did something happen with you two? - Could we talk about something else? - Like what? Like what... Pumps are gonna be in fashion this fall? I'm just asking, 'cause I wanna know what belts to buy. Funny. Pierre was working with Andre Sandrov. - Who is...? - Who is - Eureka's Albert Einstein? - I would have thought Albert Einstein would have been Eureka's Albert Einstein. Yeah, but point is, Sandrov's revered. By everyone. And he gave a statement that Pierre went awol in 1957 after giving written notice at work. Which Pierre didn't mention. The cold war's over, the Soviet Union is gone, the Red Sox won the World Series. Don't understand why that was important, but everybody tell me it is. I just don't really get baseba... Grampa, are you listening? Hey, look... I'm having a hard time processing all of this, okay? And you seem like a really nice guy. And I admit that there's a slight resemblance. But, you know... This is insane. I'm Pierre Fargo. I'm nobody's grampa. Okay? I'm not even a father. I'm pretty sure you were. Look, we're practically the same age. Well, yeah, pretty much. Okay, great. So in light of that, let's just drop "grampa" and stick with "Dr. Fargo." Okay? Nice meeting you. Wait! Wait, wait! Belle St. John is my grandmother. - So Belle is still alive? - Very much so. Well, that's wonderful news. I have to see her. - How do you get out of here? - Not by going that way. You can't see her. She's in Alaska. Which, is a state now. It's very big with tourists. - What's she doing there? - No, not that way. She's dogsledding. She'll be back on the weekend. - My Belle always had a wild side. - She also had a son. My dad, Thomas. He died in a lab accident when I was a little kid. Pushed the wrong button. I'm sorry to hear that. So I suppose she must've gotten married, then, - If she had a son. - No. She always said she was holding out for her dream man. Really? I brought a picture of her. Might look a little bit different than she did when she was 20. She's still beautiful. I've missed so much. But I'm not missing any more. 1957 brand new Ford Thunderbirds cost 3,000 bucks. Speaking of cars, I'd like to start driving mine. Not 'till you dry out. - I haven't had caffeine all day. - I said a week. A week. Wanna play hardball? Who's Angela Fairfield? You hit redial on my cell phone? Cop's daughter. You pick things up. Well, normally I'd be proud, but Zoe, don't go digging into this. If you would tell me who she is, I wouldn't have to. - Someone from my past. - Okay. Then why are you... - Why are you sending flowers today? - We're not discussing this. I think I just found out why Pierre would want to put himself on ice. Birth certificate for a... Thomas Stephen Fargo, son of Belle St. John. Born eight months after Pierre Fargo disappeared. Maybe he found out about the pregnancy, panicked, and took a cryo-trip to the future. I don't know, that seems a little extreme. Oh, it says here fatherhood can scare men into disassociation, which can lower their sex drive. You... - burn this. - Where are you going? To talk to Pierre. See if he had some fatherhood issues. I know I do. This place is a maze. Just last week, the frame for this building was going up, and now look at it. Say, did we ever get to the moon? Yeah, in '62. Way to go, guys! Top secret, of course. We didn't go public until '69. - What's that? - It's a computer. So is this. - It's so small! - Microchips. That PDA... A personal digital assistant... can store the entire library of congress and track a satellite in orbit. Terrific. - Dear lord. - The robotics lab. If you think that's impressive, you should see the big one. Holy smokes. Tissue rejuvenation research. It's not really my cup of tea, there's some computer... Hold on a second. That's my cellular reconstruction technique. They're using my methodology. No, that process is based on the research of Andre Sandrov. Sandrov? No, he... he was a lab tech. Sandrov was the forefather of modern bioengineering and cryogenics. He's a Global Dynamics treasure. See? No, this can't be. I'm the treasure. No, trust me. Nobody treasures Fargos. They treasure people who win Nobel prizes. Like Sandrov. Sandrov won the Nobel? What for? The dedifferentiation of mesenchymal cells. No! That was my idea. That idea got him a statue in the park and a multimillion dollar foundation named after him. I can't believe this. Sandrov stole my research. He stole my life. Sandrov wasn't a genius. - He was a thief. - A thief? A thief who's given millions of dollars back to this town? Yes, millions of my dollars, based on my ideas. Now, he shoved me into that chamber. A cryochamber which I designed, by the way. How do you like that for irony? Just so he could steal my work and pass it off as his own. We found Sandrov's police statement. In that statement, he said that you left a letter of resignation before you disappeared. Now why would I resign? I was on the verge of greatness. Which he has now taken from me. He is a liar. Work was great. Belle was... Pregnant. Belle was pregnant. Careful, slim. I respect that you're an officer of the law, but you're insulting the good name of my girl, I will not stand for it. Come on. Nobody's insulting anybody. Belle St. John gave birth to Thomas Stephen Fargo eight months after you left. Fatherhood is a big responsibility, and you wouldn't be the first guy to run from it. Run from it? I was going to propose to Belle. I... Here, look. I was on my way to pick up the ring before our dinner. Believe me, fatherhood is the last thing that I would run from. Not sure how I'm supposed to feel. I just lost a son that i never knew I had. You still have me. Not sure how I'm supposed to feel about that. Andre Sandrov took away my family and ruined my good name. And now he has to pay. And I will set the record straight. You honestly believe that Andre Sandrov stole Pierre Fargo's research? Well, I don't know, which is why I'm gonna ask him. Of all the ridiculous claims, and by a Fargo. - You're saying it's not even possible? - No. Well, yes. Scientists are always bickering over credit for breakthroughs. Or denying responsibility for them. - Are you still on that? - Can we please stay focused on this? Look, Sandrov was a visionary. His work is well-documented. Read any of his voluminous biographies. Or get a book on tape. Just do the tox screen on Pierre's blood. - I'm gonna go talk to your visionary. - Please. I need you to keep in mind that the Sandrov foundation is funding our stem cell research. So you want me to go easy on him because he gives you money? No. But he is a very well-respected man with a lot of friends at the DOD. So for your own sake, tread lightly. I believe that when someone is responsible for something, that they should be held accountable. If you could wait on the lower terrace, Dr. Sandrov will join you momentarily. Thank you. Nice place. This is what a Nobel prize buys you. So... Where did you and Angela Fairfield meet? Let it go. Can I help you? I'm Sheriff Jack Carter. This is my deputy, Jo Lupo. Is there something wrong? Depends on how you look at it. Not sure if you've heard, Global Dynamics revived someone from cryostasis today. Really? He's apparently been in there for about 50 years. Well, that is tremendous. I knew that design would prove itself out. I just didn't know if it would be within my lifetime. The man they woke up is Pierre Fargo. He claims that you stole his research, including the cryochamber. Do you rememsber him? Yes, of course. He used to work for me. And how in the world did he end up in cryostasis? That's what we're trying to figure out. Pierre seemed to make it sound like you worked for him. Well,  I'm not surprised. Pierre's reach often exceed his grasp. He tried to pass off my work as his own. I offered to let him resign rather than fire him. Then he disappeared. Shame, really. He was quite talented. Some people just seem destined for failure. Is there any truth to Pierre Fargo's claims? I'd like to think the body of my work speaks for itself. But I look forward to hearing how he recovers. Wish him well for me. Thank you. Now, I'm... hosting a cocktail fundraiser this evening that I need to prepare for, so, unless there's anything else... Not at the moment. Thank you for your time. Not at all. Charming guy. If this breakthrough is based on Sandrov's work, he should've been dying - to see the result. - And he was. Until he found out it was Pierre. Yeah. So what now? I think Sandrov is a smart guy. We take his suggestion, go check out his body of work. This town is amazing. The transformation is just incredible. All along here were quonset huts. And a... And a dirt road, if you can believe it. I mean, there were only 100 of us. It was more military base than town. Yeah, they didn't bring in the city planners and architects until the '60s. No, no, it's okay. It's just a car alarm. It's anti-theft. Well, we used to leave our keys in the ignition. I guess times have changed. Well, it's really nice having you back, grampa. I tell you what. You can call me Pierre. Oh, sorry. I'm... I'm just excited. I've never really had a grandfather. Or a father. Or... Friends. Well, I guess if you don't use it in public, it's okay. Deal. So, where are we going? To see an old friend. We have the results of Pierre's tox screen. So is our boy a deadbeat dad, or... did somebody throw him in the freezer? Well, there are traces of chloroform in his system. Traces? Fine. There's enough there to sink him like a rock. So Pierre told the truth. Somebody was out to get him. Well, if you're looking for more praise from me... What I'm looking at is the praise for Andre Sandrov. - I'm wondering if it's deserved. - Deserved? Sandrov was one of the greatest thinkers of his time. Of any time. Yeah, but he was just a mid-level researcher until his big - breakthrough in cell regeneration. - So? So that didn't happen until a month after Pierre disappeared. Charlie, you old dog. In the flesh. You haven't aged a day. Where've you been? Well, you remember my little cryostasis project? Let's say it worked. And here I am. I have something for you. How about that? That's from 1957! Looks just like new, doesn't it? So do you still have that diamond you were growing for Belle's ring? I'm sorry, Pierre. I sold it a couple of years after you left. Or we thought you'd left. Well, it was a long shot. I was hoping I could still give it to her. I don't know, you might wanna think about that. I mean, a lot's happened since you disappeared. And people really believed that I would just leave her like that? Even you? I came by with the diamond, and... And you'd gone. So Belle has lived this entire time believing that I... ran off on her? She did fine, Pierre. I mean, she's a strong one. But seeing her now... Might not go the way you planned. Okay. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Charlie. Take care. Let's go. Go where? To clear my name. We have to find that letter. - We? - Of course. Well, it's your name too. Let's go. SARAH, I need to look up a name. Of course. Who? Dad's new girlfriend, Angela Fairfield. I don't feel comfortable prying into the sheriff's personal life.</i> Oh, no, no. I'm not prying. I just want to know... who she is, and where she lives, and what she looks like. Sorry, out of the question. Okay. Fair. But you know, it would be a shame for everyone to find out about your addiction to Jerry Springer. I have no idea who that is. You're not fooling anyone. There's no Angela Fairfield living in Eureka.</i> Can you try widening the search? None in Oregon. Okay, try other places my dad has lived. Over the last 25 years, there have been four in Laguna Beach.</i> Show me their pictures. I... I know his type. Okay, the one with the big hair. Who is she? There's a juvenile police record associated with her name. - But it's closed. - A record? A record for who? Your father. It could take forever to find my letter in all these files. Restricted files. We shouldn't be in here. - Then hurry. - I've changed my mind. I don't think I can do this. Well, you have to. What if we get caught? What's the worst that could happen? I'd lose my job and you'd go to jail. I've seen the way people treat you around here. Getting fired could be a blessing. True. Come on. Let's get at it. - Please, open it. - I found it. Super. Now let's get that letter and get out of here. Okay. Yes. - There we go. - Here it is. August 30th, 1957. "For personal reasons beyond my control, "I hereby tender my resignation, "effective immediately. Sincerely, Pierre Fargo." Is that your signature? Well, yes, but I never wrote this. What the hell are you doing? You set alarms off all over the building. Don't punish him. This was my idea. And that would be what, exactly? Sandrov set me up. And I need this resignation letter to prove it. Okay. Can I see it? I know this looks bad. Yeah, well, it's about to look a lot worse. It is astonishing his tissue could have survived all these years without any signs of degeneration. It's good to see you back to real science. Feels good. Nothing like exploring the unknown. Nothing like it. The other day, you said that... you knew for sure that the accident was not my fault. - How do you know? - I... found something in Kim's lab. Her... computers were sabotaged. - By whom? - I don't know. But clearly, you and Kim were on the verge of understanding something that... Someone was trying to protect. Pierre's blood analysis. Have you ever seen anything like that? Never. The bad news is, we have you on a class III security breach. The good news is that the mattress is surprisingly supportive. If he's staying, I'm staying with him. - That's fine with me. - I have to go to the bathroom. There's one just in there. Can't he use your bathroom, Sheriff? The window doesn't even open. All right. But... Just be quick about it. - Swell. - Mr. Fairfield. Excuse me for a second. I need to take this. All right. I'm watching. I mean, I'm not watching, but I'm watching. Sorry about that. No, no... No need to thank... I know. Yeah, me too. So what have you got on Angela Fairfield?</i> I found some photo documentation. What are these from? Angela's high school yearbook. Wait, wait. Stop there. No way... That's dad. There's another one of them together. So... She was his high school sweetheart. Why is he still sending her flowers? Wait, wait. Hold it there. Oh, my god. She died. Sorry about that. He's been in there since you left. Pierre? This is sheriff Carter. Go away, Sheriff. There's nothing you can do for me now. What sort of trouble are you having? Not the kind you'd understand, Sheriff. I could kick the door down. We'll call that plan "B." Look... I know this has to be a shock. Things must look pretty bleak. You're scared. We've all been there. Not exactly there. But my point is, you don't have to go through this alone. You have family out here. Or there's plan "B." That's happening too fast. The stase is temporary altering the aging process, but as soon as he got out... - It's making up for lost time. - Exactly. The problem is that the accelerated aging is causing advanced cell degeneration. There is no indication that that is slowing down. I just got him back. I'm gonna lose him? Fargo, we are doing everything we can. It's uncharted territory. Of course it is. - Fargo... - No, he's not just some screwup. He had his whole life stolen from him. His work, his reputation, his family. He doesn't deserve this. Don't treat him like just another lab rat. I'm gonna go see my grampa. - Hey. How you doing? - Well, I'm just hours away from bedpans and sponge baths. Can't wait. Don't say that. They'll figure something out. I appreciate you being here, Charlie. Just wanted to see you with a few wrinkles. Couldn't stand that baby face of yours. Hey, listen. If I go without seeing Belle, would you do me a favor and tell her that I came back to her? And I never stopped loving her? - You'll tell her yourself. - Would you do that for me, pal? - I will. - Thank you. Hey, Charlie. Pierre. Fargo. Well, thanks for the books, Sheriff. But I don't think I have a lot of leisure time left. Kinda busy trying to save Fargo's granddad. - What do you need? - Yeah... I checked out a bunch of biographies of Sandrov's that talk about his groundbreaking research. Generally what biographies do, yes. But they were written about breakthroughs that happened after Pierre disappeared. - So let's see what he knows. - Carter, you're wasting time. I don't have a lot of time left. All I have is my name. And my legacy. And I'd like a chance to set the record straight before I go. Exactly. And since you're the Sandrov expert, and you have access to all the classified information, I think it should be you who asks him the questions only real talent would know. Fine. What did you first use to encourage cell regeneration? Well, you need raw materials, so we started with hepatocyte and osteoblast stimulants. Were you successful? Not exactly. Uh, the first... Successful cell regeneration occurred on my 482nd try. I take it from your silence that's another right answer. When were you first able to isolate and identify signals responsible for cell growth? Actually, I wasn't. It was my hypothesis that the expression of... small molecules known as micro RNAS act as molecular regulators and thereby control the growth of isolates. But... It was a long shot. A theory that proved to be true. Five years after Pierre disappeared. So he's right. Pierre, your research changed our understanding of the human cell. It was Pierre's work all along. Anybody want to crash a party? Me. I just finished lecturing in Vienna, so I could return to do the galleys for my new book in october. And what would the title of that book be, Andre? My life as a fraud? Pierre. Why don't we go into the parlor? No, thank you. You've kept me hidden long enough. - Don't know what you're talking about. - You be careful. I'm a dying man with nothing left to lose. - And it's all because of you. - Dr. Sandrov, you had plenty of opportunity and everything to gain. You think I put him in the cryochamber? No. I have gains of my own. This town wouldn't be here without me. Tell 'em, Dr. Stark. I wish I could. We know that your breakthroughs were based upon Pierre's work, which you passed off as your own. It was unethical. It was illegal. But attempted murder is a different matter altogether. I attempted nothing of the kind. I came into the lab that night, and you weren't there. Your letter of resignation was on the table, and that was it. I never wrote that letter. And I find it hard to believe you didn't notice there was someone in one of the chambers. Nobody noticed. We were all caught up in our own deadlines. I was failing to meet mine. So... when you didn't come back... Your work was there. And it was brilliant. I just picked up where you left off. A sin of omission. If you didn't put my grampa in there, who did? I don't know. I am sorry, Pierre. So what do we do now? Only thing we can do. A great scientist is dying of rapid tissue degeneration. You're gonna help me save him. You really think this'll work? The treatment is based on your theory, Pierre. I simply augmented and refined it. Unfortunately, it's not gonna make you any younger. Grampa... Okay. Let me have it. Okay. Right. Yeah, okay. Well, those years are gone anyhow. I just want to make the most of the time I have left. And we'll all make sure you get credit where credit is due. Won't we, Dr. Sandrov? Of course. Still working on figuring out who put you in that chamber. Well, it's your worry now, chief. The truth's come out, and... I just want to put things right with Belle. I wish I still had this ring that I was going to give her. Could I see that order slip for a second? Thanks. The signature on this resignation letter is traced... from your order slip. Hey, Sheriff. I heard what happened. You made it. That's twice you've risen from the dead in one week. Why'd you put him in, Charlie? I knew, soon as I saw you in my shop... My sins had come back to haunt me. You looked me in the eye and you called me your friend. I'm so sorry. Why, Charlie? Why? You were gonna propose to Belle. And I've always loved her. - You never said a word. - When I showed up to deliver the ring, well... I couldn't let her go. I thought if you were gone, Belle would think you'd run out on her. I could be her savior. Well, like you say, the past always catches up with you. - We're gonna have to take you in. - Sure. Hold on a sec. Putting Charlie in prison isn't gonna give me my life back. He was in love with Belle. I understand how that feels. Turning the other cheek doesn't really apply here. Well, he has to live alone with what he's done. I think that's punishment enough. And that's not for you to decide. Sheriff's right. For what it's worth... She never got over you. Hey, Dad. Hey. Let me guess. You need a lift home. Yeah, but, um, that's... That's actually not why I came. I wanted to apologize for nagging you about Angela. It's all right. I found your yearbook. And... I know that she died. Yeah. Yeah, she did. What happened? I was 17. And I made a very, very big mistake. She was a... Great girl. She was... Uh... fearless. Reckless. A little like you, actually. It was her 16th birthday. She wanted me to teach her how to drive. She was doing great. And... We were celebrating. We... Drifted into the next lane. And... swerved to... get around a car. I'm so sorry, Dad. When the police arrived, I was holding her. They assumed... I was driving. And I was charged with reckless endangerment. Why didn't you just tell them what happened? It was my responsibility. Doesn't matter. So... Every year, I send flowers to the cemetery. And every year, her father calls to thank me. I haven't talked about this in a long, long time. Well... Thank you for... telling me. I hope I don't disappoint her. Oh, you won't. A lot has happened. I don't exactly know what I'm going to say. Well, I think when you... Think when you'll see her, you'll know. You look so beautiful. After all these years. I'm so sorry that I left you alone, my love. It's okay. You're here now. I've wanted to do this for a very long time. Get over yourself, Fargo.
