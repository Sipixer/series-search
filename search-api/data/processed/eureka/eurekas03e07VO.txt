This complex is massive. - Prewar. What, late 30's? - I believe. It's before Eureka was built. What's down there? Ever since you got to this town, you've been looking for something. Tell me what's going on. No. - I have to what? - Oversee the mayoral election. This is the official polling place. It's not a big deal, Carter. - Well, now why can't Jo do it? - Because Jo's not your lackey. Well, the town charter says that voting security falls on the highest ranking law enforcement officer. That would be you. Unless you promote me or become otherwise incapacitated. The Mayor's seat has been open for over a year. The town needs a voice. This is a very important service card. How important can it be? I mean, my daughter's backing her 17-year-old boyfriend for the job. Eureka doesn't discriminate. Some of our smartest citizens are teens. So instead of working, I have to sit here and count ballots for some doogie Mayor? No, actually, your sister volunteered for that job. It's a bad idea. Lex becomes really obsessed with politics. And her mood swings are already out of hand. Actually, she's really into it. And you should be more sensitive. - Your sister's pregnant. - I'm Mr. Sensitive. Like... What... Paper ballots? Digital voting machines are way too easy to tamper with. And campaigns get really competitive around here. Okay. I'll do it. I'm... I'm... - Thank you. - Mr. Sensitive though. Oh, my goodness. What a beautiful baby. Love that shirt. There we go. More Vinspresso? Remember, vote Vincent. Great. They love you! I can't believe I let you talk me into this. I hate politics. We're the glue that holds this town together, Vincent. It's time we had a voice. Smile. - That's great, thanks. - All right. Now back to kissin' babies. A vote for Lucas is a vote for youthful innovation. Oh, here's his ten point plan. Kylie, can you help me pass out some more buttons, please? Then can we work on our lab project? What's more important, Kylie, homework or changing the world? I don't know, Zoe. - I've never been much of a leader. - Which is why you have me. That baby face of yours promises idealism and hope for all the minors of the town. And I am going to help you deliver it. - You mean manipulate it. - Tomay-to. Tomah-to. Sheriff Carter. Halo Herrera. Nephrologist, concerned citizen, and future mayor of Eureka. Well, you don't see that combo platter everyday. I'd like to talk about your endorsement. I'm getting coffee. - Could... - Not your lackey. Well, I... Mr. Herrera is it? I would love to endorse somebody, but... But he's already promised his endorsement... - To my candidate, right, Sheriff? - Actually... Eureka needs a mayor who understands how a company town works. Why? So your boss can have some Global Dynamics puppet to sell out the town? How many people is Thorne gonna fire? So Vincent is the best candidate, he's all about nurturing the community. Guys! I just want my coffee. Vincent, get Sheriff Carter a Vinspresso on the house. It's already on the house and bribery is a crime. Yeah. Nice try, Fargo. Do we amuse you, Herrera? Watch and learn, kids. Folks, would everybody follow me outside? I have something that will entertain and amaze you. Okay. I'm done. Now can we talk about our project? I've got some damage control to do. - Why don't you just get it started? - But we're supposed to work together. We will after you've shown me what you've got. - So you're letting me take lead? - That's right. Now get to work, partner. Leave professional politics to the professionals. - Told you it gets competitive. - That's just wrong. - Big news, guys. - Yeah, what's up? Those ancient security cameras we saw in the bunker, I pulled the negatives before Thorne locked the place up again. It's 35 millimeter. We just have to find someone old enough to develop it. What? The latest next gen technology Zane's been developing for our sponsor. Overengineered to keep you cool in the hottest situations. It's amazing what the greatest minds and a big old corporate check can buy. Too bad we can't buy the next mayoral election. Just kidding, Allison. I would, however, like you to endorse Dr. Herrera. Well, won't that be seen as Global Dynamics taking sides? Maybe. But on the other hand, having someone to smooth ruffled feathers during the next round of cutbacks isn't a bad idea. Well, I prefer to make up my own mind. You should also think about what's best for Global. We need a personal relationship with the town. One that shows that we're all on the same team. Are you and I on the same team, Eva? Of course. I'd like to think we're also friends. Good. So why don't you tell me what's in the bunker under Tesla. We found bariogenic radiation. Zoe and her friends are very lucky that they weren't infected. That's why I'm ordering a thermal cleaning of the entire facility. You realize you'll destroy any organic material that's left inside. Our first obligation is to the town. Excuse me. Make sure you vote. This is Allison Blake. I need some records from the archive. What a time suck this is. How did we live before digital? I never knew you had an artistic side, Carter. I'm a man of many facets. Check out the date stamp. 1939. I thought Eureka wasn't founded till 1950. Well, it wasn't. What were they doin' down there? Well, whatever it was, they tried to bury it for good. Look who we have here. - SARAH, lights. - <i>Certainly, Sheriff.</i> That was yesterday? Thorne's been lookin' for somethin' ever since she came to Eureka. How much you wanna bet it's in this room? So what is she up to? That's gonna have to wait till tomorrow. The debate's about to start. - You prepare your opening remarks? - What opening remarks? Hello. Hello. Is this on?</i> Hi, everyone. Welcome to debate night.</i> - I'm Sheriff Carter and I'll be... - Cut to the chase! We want issues, not filler! Thank you, Lexi, for your wildly inappropriate enthusiasm. So without further ado, I give you your candidates. And if elected, I'll bring the same principles to the mayor's office as I do to Caf√© Diem. In short, you want it, I got it! I promise to bring a voice to the pre-teen prodigy that the establishment too often sees as just another pretty brain. Times are changing and Eureka must change with it. I will protect the tenets on which this town was founded and help usher in a new day for Eureka. It's a new day all right. Season 3 Episode 7 Here Come the Suns (v 1.00) Team Projet-SG. Just another days in Eureka. Well, it's a mini sun. Really? Took you all night to come up with that? No. It took us all night to rule out any GD experiments as the cause. - So now we have two suns. - Just like Tatooine. - Tatu-what? - Geek speak. The good news is it's stable holding its position at about 1,000 feet. We're not lighting the entire state. The last thing we need is a spotlight on the town the whole world can see. Well, agree. But it's 6:00 AM. And 90 degrees. How do we turn it off? I'm not sure yet. It has to be some kind of fusion reaction. - Sounds dangerous. - No, not necessarily. Based on its containment, I'd say it's deliberate. Who'd want to make a second sun on purpose? Maybe the guy who was trying to make a big bang at the debates. Oh, cloud guy. Herrera. Eva wanted me to endorse him. - Such a hidden agenda. - What do you mean? Zane found some security photos of her sneaking around the facility. - What's down there anyway? - Well, nothing for long. She ordered a thermal cleaning. Can we stop it till we get inside? No, she's forbidden access. The whole place is classified. Something's goin' on. You go talk to Herrera. I'll look into it. Yes, Allison Blake. She asked for me? Okay. I'm on my way. - Hot enough for you? - Yeah. What's with the umbrellas? He likes to be prepared? Did that just come from inside? That would be yes. You changed your mind about that endorsement? Not really. What is this? This is the end to drought, which we may be needing sooner than later. Welcome to my cloud farm. Cloud farm? Yeah, that's... That's what he said. I'm taking Cloud City to a whole new level with nanotech hydration. Cumulus, stratus, cirrus, I can create 'em all. Like you did with the cloud gag yesterday. Nice, huh? I found a way to hydrogenically infuse the atmosphere so I can sculpt clouds. The commercial applications are limitless. Well, I'm more concerned about your sun stunt. Sun? No, no. I'm a cloud guy. Not that I don't mind the bump in the polling numbers. People love a spectacle. Yeah, but you have to admit the timing was suspicious. Have anyone from Global come and review my record. My life is an open book, Sheriff. I'm beholden to my constituents. Gotta admit, it's a hell of a show. Zane. Just the man I'm lookin' for. Save your breath, Fargo. I already know who I'm voting for. I'm offended. You think I'm only here to get your vote? - You're not? - No. I also want a favor. It is roasting out there. A candidate has to project cool confidence under the most extreme conditions. I hear you're beta testing something that can help with staying cool. - Yeah, I might be. - Give me enough to get through the election and if... when Vincent wins, I'll name a park bench after you. Tempting, but no. I don't do politics. But good luck with that. Based on these sun scans, I'd say your competition's definitely heating up. I was testing the voting machines and I got dizzy. I know you're not an OB. Not really a fan of western medicine. - But I trust you. - Well, I'm flattered. I'm sure you have much bigger issues to deal with. Yes, and I have people to deal with them. So let's put your mind at ease. So Carter says you've always been interested in politics. He said I'm obsessed, didn't he? No. Jack thinks the system is broken. But I think it's up to us to make the system work. Well, this little guy's system is working perfectly. Here. Want to take a look? It's amazing. - What, is something wrong? - I think I figured out why your hormones are so out of whack. You're getting a double dose. Lexi, you're having twins. Both boys. Two sons? Two suns. Why didn't I think of that? - Because it's crazy. - It's brilliant. Lucas, I don't think you appreciate what's at stake here. I mean, the mayor's office oversees City hall. - So? - So... That includes the Sheriff's department. You could be my dad's boss. - And I thought he hated me now. - It's time to step up our game. When the world hands you suns, make sunscreen. Iced mocha, folks. Stays cool as Vincent will be when he takes the oath of office. Suits? It's over 100 degrees out here. Some candidates can handle the heat better than others. Nice gimmick. We're just helping the voters stay refreshed so they can make a cogent decision at the polling booth. We're just trying to protect voters from harmful UV rays so they won't be blinded by indecision. - Iced mocha! Get it while it's cold. - Sunscreen, people. Vote lucas and say no to premature aging. Zoe, I've had a small issue with our class project. Bigger priorities at the moment, Kylie. Here, grab a box. No. I think this is something you're really gonna want to see. This better be good. Okay, Fargo, what's the big emergency? The corruption of the democratic process. Everyone knows Herrera's in Thorne's pocket. And now she's harassing my candidate. Look. - What are you talking about? - It's my wall of fame. Thorne took it. She redacted all the photos of Eureka's founders. She doesn't want the voters to see how connected Vincent is to this town's history. - Why would she do that? - Why? Herrera checked out. There's nothing in his background having to do with solar energy or fusion power. Great. So we got two suns and no suspect. And now apparently no air conditioning. Get anything off Herrera? Other than a creepy politician vibe, no. No, nothing. - What did you find? - Well, I ran some scans. The sun has all the properties of a main sequence dwarf star. The big question is its energy source. Well, I might be able to shed some light on that. I ordered copies of all records having to do with the hidden facility under Tesla. Now, of course, Eva's either had them redacted or they don't exist. But she forgot one thing. Accounting. Oh, somebody messed up their lunch receipt. The DOD keeps track of every penny that they spent. So I thought I'd see where they were spending in 1939. Check out the stuff they were ordering. Deuterium. Tritium. These are heavy hydrogen atoms. Yeah, and the essential elements in building fusion bombs. So Thorne dug up an old bomb testing facility? We gotta get into that room before Thorne does her thermal cleaning thing. To do what exactly? To figure out whether something down there is causing what's up here. Hurry up. It's over here. Kylie, it's a billion degrees out. I don't have time to play house. Excuse me. I'm nine and I'm a junior. I don't play house. Then what are we doing here? Take a look. Kylie, can you remind me what our assignment was? Build a working model of the solar system. Took that a bit literally, did you? How'd you get all the planets to orbit like that? They are not the problem. The sun's a little off. We are so getting an "A". One small issue. I can't make it stop. So we're not getting an "A"? Yeah, not so much. You know what, a controlled fusion reaction like this takes real talent. Well, it wasn't even that hard. Take a gravitron field generator, surround it in a little reactor plasma, heat and serve. Served up kind of a big helping, don't you think? Well, we're a little off on the plasma density. We? Oh no, no, no. See, I didn't do this. And I'm gonna need you to resign from the campaign. We can't afford the scandal. Thanks for the support, partner. Henry, I got a town full of cranky people who need some sleep. You got any ideas? Yeah, make it do what it's supposed to do. It should've started to dissipate by now. Well, it's... It's getting some fuel from somewhere. Chances are it'll burn itself out. But in the meantime, I'm gonna go back to my garage and research just how fast. - Thanks. Let me know what you found. - Can I come? I want to help. I think you helped enough already today, don't you? I tell you what, you can take atmospheric readings, okay? Great. Great. So what convinced you? Oh, Eva had all the old photos removed from Caf√© Diem. Add that to the mass redaction of old GD records... And making Jo shut down the Eureka museum. And having me and Henry dig up this place. They're all windows into Eureka's past. Windows Thorne seems to want shut. Let's find out why. Focus on our constituents. No swag for seniors. We're on a budget. Hey, Kylie, look, about earlier. - You mean when you sold me out? - You made a second sun. - You told me to take the lead. - I was being nice. Like all politicians, you'll say whatever it takes to get what you want. Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do. The radiogenic detection field reads negative for fusion products. That good or bad? It means we're not being radiated. Rats. That's definitely a good thing, Carter. No, I mean, literally. Rats. - You got somethin' you want to say? - No. Okay, come on. Henry said that the second sun was getting fuel from somewhere. - Is it down here? - Well, if it is, I'm not finding it. Can't believe this place has been under us all these years. It's like a door into Eureka's past. Look at this. That's the door we saw in the security photos. All right, - let's unlock it. - My specialty. So how long do you need? This long. These old school locks are no match for a 20 zettahertz processor. Okay. This is a bit of a letdown. Why order a thermal cleaning of an empty room? Good point. Maybe it wasn't always empty. Can I see the light scanner thingy? One biotelemetric dispersion scanner. Yes. Okay. Coming up. This baby reads patterns of movement left behind by organic materials. All right, let's see who's been in here. Look at that. The dust layer means that these prints are old. But these high heels are definitely new. So are the military boots. Looks like they were moving stuff out. Like what? - Like them. - Oh, my God. - Are those... - Bodies? Carter, hand me the scanner. These bodies were removed in the last 24 hours. We have to find out who they were and what they were doing down here. And why Thorne was trying to hide them. This facility is classified and scheduled for thermal cleaning. Yet here you are violating direct orders. I'd except this kind of insubordination from you, Sheriff. - Thank you. - But from you two... I've always had a bit of trouble with authority. As far as I'm concerned, this just became an active crime scene. Oh, this is out of your jurisdiction, Sheriff. I'd be happy to have the DOD remind you of that. And I'd be happy to tell them why. - You tryin' to bluff me? - No, he's not, because he's leaving. - We all are. - No, actually. - We're not. - Carter, we crossed the line. Let's not make it any worse. - You sure about this? - Sorry. Okay. - I can't believe Allison backed down. - Yeah, me neither. Now Thorne has all the evidence. I wouldn't say all the evidence. I yanked the chip from the dispersion scanner before they took my stuff. We can see images of everything we scanned. Nice. That's definitely not good. Really? Based on my initial data, it should've burned itself out hours ago. That doesn't look like it's burning out. It looks like it's getting hotter. I'm melting. It's midnight and 110 in the shade. - People are getting pretty testy. - Yeah, me included. It reminds me of tornado weather. I have a really bad feeling about this. Well, just keep everybody calm and preferably indoors. Roger that. Kylie is gathering atmospheric data. I should know something soon. All right. Zane's working on it too. And in the meantime, Thorne's wiping out any evidence that connects her to these bodies. - Any idea who they were? - I'm getting conflicting information. How so? From the surveillance photos, their approximate age is somewhere between 35 and 45 when they entered the room in 1939. - All right. With you so far. - The organic residue that you scanned establishes that they also died in 1939. So they were buried there for 70 years? Yeah, here's the really puzzling thing. Common sense says they were around 40 when they died. But based on these readings, their biological age is somewhere around 80. I want someone posted outside that facility at all times. Nobody comes in until after the thermal cleaning. Let's get the bodies ready for transport. Transport? To where? I'm afraid it's classified information, Allison, as is everything in this room. And I'd really appreciate it if you leave now. You said that you considered us to be friends. I do too. So why don't you just tell me who those men are? I know what it looks like from where you stand, but it's not what you think. These were good men who gave their lives for this town. And it could've been prevented. You make it sound as if you knew them. It's time for you to go now. - Why are you doing this? - Because I have to. Dr. Deacon, there's something I think you're really gonna want to see. Well, please tell me you didn't make another sun. No, I've been trying to figure out how to extinguish the first one. - You mean the second one. - Semantics? Really, Sheriff? Could we just... Kylie, what did you find? Well, I've been doing readings all over town and the upper air is saturated with excess hydrogen. - Is that bad? - Well, not by itself. But mixed with Kylie's project, hydrogen could cause a whopping fusion reaction. Well, how whopping are we talking? Well, depending on the source and how much is left, big. Look, I don't know where this hydrogen is coming from, but I promise I didn't do it. That's okay. I have a pretty good idea who did. There's no way my clouds caused this. Well, it's not the clouds themselves. It's what's inside of them. - It's a whole lot of hydrogen, right? - Well, not that much. Maybe 1,000 liters at standard temperature and pressure. Well, you've been outside. It's plenty. How was I supposed to know someone'd be creating a stellar fusion reaction? Hello. You live in Eureka. I guess this means I won't be getting your endorsement. Well, it's... Just stick to the problem. Is this how you deliver the nanos to make your clouds? Yep. A single stage booster that fuels the cold accelerant mixer for better saturation and heat dispersion. - Nice. - We gotta fix this. Can you reverse it? You mean exsanguinate the excess hydrogen from Eureka's lower atmosphere? - Yes. - No. I mean, I can make any shape you want, but once the clouds have seeded, natural hydration processes take over. I say we enjoy the extra sunlight while we can. It'll burn itself out soon enough. You were saying? It should've extinguished itself. But it didn't. That's because Kylie's sun... Ingenious though it is... has evolved from a dwarf star and is developing into a red super giant. - Which means? - Instead of burning out, it's blowing up big time. Not my fault entirely. It's not stopping there. The sun flares are just the beginning. And we only have a few hours before it goes critical. Okay, what are our options? If we can launch a dispersion module, a concentration of iron atoms fired directly into the sun's core - should cause it to implode. - And imploding's a good thing? Yes. Once the sun's incapable of fusion reaction, then, we'll all be safe. What if it doesn't work? We all get front row seats to a supernova way bigger than Hiroshima. And Eureka becomes a mile deep crater. That's too risky. We need to evacuate now. Y... Jo's already started. But this is also the most advanced research complex on the planet and we have an opportunity to save it. And I'm already developing a compound to trigger the implosion. - And I'm working on a delivery system. - Towns can be rebuilt. People can't. Which is why we're evacuating the people while we're trying to save the town. You might be comfortable risking lives, but I'm not. Make sure everybody gets out while there's time. Eva, we have a chance to save decades of research. That wasn't a request. It's like she wants to see the place go up in flames. I think she might. Well, what now? Let's go, people! Move! Move! Shuttles are waiting outside. Let's go! You know what, after the election, we'll have the influence around. - Maybe I can up your pay rate. - Don't make me use the stun gun. You heard her, Fargo. Keep moving. Everybody move. But we're just making sure his constituents are safely away first. How come you two aren't drenched like the rest of us? Oh, a worthy candidate is always cool under pressure, Sheriff. And it's classified. However, I could be convinced to share my secret for, say, your endorsement. This is mine. Both of you on the bus. Go. Go! Everybody move! Keep goin'! Sounds like we're using sunscreen to beat injustice. - Just smile and look pretty. - Zo, what are you doin'? You gotta go. Guys, please. Not yet. Latest election polls only show Lucas down by two points. You wanna score points with the voters or with your girlfriend's old man? No contest, sir. - That'll work. - Vote Lucas! All right, everybody's cleared out. Any luck? - We're locked and loaded, Sheriff. - XRT online and ready. It'll take two people to get the module in position for launch. I can do that. - I can do that on my own. - No. I'll go with you. No. I'll go with you. I know this baby best. Okay. All right. You three get to an evacuation site. - Nice work. - Thanks. - Be careful. - Thanks. Could you keep an eye on Lex and Zoe? Of course. Just come back safely. Thanks. We're at a safe distance from town. We can move everyone quickly if we need to, but with... ten evac camps for 2,600 people. Things are gonna get crowded. How are you feelin'? I just wish someone would do something about the heat. I hear your pain. This town needs a Mayor who can be cool in a crisis. And if I'm elected, I promise I won't sleep until darkness falls again on Eureka. Oh, please. You don't need stale campaign promises. You need ideas that are fresh as baked bread, which by the way, Vincent also provides twice daily. Say no to half-baked science and overbaked bread. - Lucas is your man. - Can't bake his way out of a paper bag. - Like cloud makers... - What is wrong with all of you? Eureka was founded to protect the greater good. You're worried about votes. You should be worried about lives. You cannot be a leader if there is no town to lead. So I suggest you get your priorities straight. That was beautiful. Having fun yet? Driving headlong into a fiery death is everybody's idea of a good time. Sometimes I think it's his. Carter, could we have a minute? Sure. Jo, you're supposed to be miles away at an evac camp by now. I should risk my life more often. I prefer you didn't. Come on, Josefina, don't go all serious on me now. It's too late. - I thought we agreed to evacuate. - We did. What are you still doing here? None of your business. Don't play games. I'm not. I think Zane's device is gonna work. - Probably. - If you don't die first. That is part of the job. And the men in that bunker would know that. Whatever it is you think you know about what you found or about me, it's wrong. Maybe. But I'm just gettin' started. If there's one thing I learned in life is that nobody should be left behind, no matter what the reason. And that includes you. I'm duty bound to enforce this evacuation. Jo, make sure she gets out of town safely. And no, that's not a request. That looks pretty bad. You sure the rocket can handle it? An untested delivery system aimed at an out of control mini sun. What could go wrong? Ready? It's fried. I'll call Allison. Okay, Carter, what's wrong? Zane's module. Electronics are fried. Do you have any spares lying around? GD has plenty of short range booster assemblies. We just need to adapt them to the XRT's specifications. - We'll never make it back in time. - There is another way. Dr. Herrera's hydrogen seeding device. It uses similar boosters to the XRT. But my greenhouse is too close to that sun. And there's no way they'll ever survive the heat. Well, hold on. Maybe there is. - <i>What are you thinking?</i> - Well, like Fargo said earlier. We just need to stay cool under pressure. I've been workin' on this heat protection formula for weeks. - Sure that'll work? - It's a prototype. But it's overengineered to respond to increased body heat and adrenaline. Takin' on a supernova so we should have plenty of both. All you gotta do is slather it on. We should have a good 10, maybe 15 minutes before we combust. Fantastic. That's gettin' worst. - Then why are you slowin' down? - I'm not. You smell burning rubber? Gonna have to run for it. Dude, it's like 2 zillion degrees out there. - Okay, I'm game. - You do anything normal for fun? I play a wicked game of yahtzee. Put that gel on thick if you know what's good for ya. You ready? I feel like a lobster in here. Temp's climbing. If we stay long, we'll boil. Find that rocket. - It might help if I could see anything. - Keep looking! Got it! Got it! Yep! Right! This way. And... set. We only get one shot at this. I don't wanna miss. Using GPS to target? - I was gonna eyeball it. - Oh, stellar. Whatever happens, it's been fun. No, it hasn't. Push the button. Take a look at that. That is quite a sunset. So you managed to pull it off. You sound disappointed. Someone cancelled the thermal cleaning. I wonder who. You may have the backing of the DOD, but these people still work for me. - And you work for me. - Not without an explanation. - Those bodies... - Are my concern. You're asking me to trust you, but you're giving me nothing. Well, I'll give you some advice. History has a way of haunting you no matter how far you run. This is mine and I'm putting it to rest. So you stay out of my way. Listen, whoever wins, it was nice doing battle with you. After all this, I don't even care who wins anymore. - As long as one of us buries that guy. - Amen to that. Hey, partner. Thanks for the save. Fiery death not popular with voters. I caused it. It's the least I could do. My fault too. I got so caught up in everything when I should've been helping you. - This time I'll make it up to you. - This time? Well, we have to make a new model. And someone should make sure I don't destroy the universe. So... Partners? - Glad to see you're okay. - Me too. - Look, about before... - It's cool, Jo. It was a crisis. You were caught up in the moment. No, I wasn't. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Way to go, Sheriff. So how's the... Itchy. Hope that means it's healing well. Listen, what... you and Zane did was a brave... mythic. Maybe selfish. - I'm growing attached to the town. - This town, is fortunate to have you to protect it. - I'm just doin' my job. - And... Thorne? I'm workin' on it. May I have your attention, please? 'scuse me. Everyone, can I have your attention, please? Everyone. Quiet! Thank you. All the ballots are in. It was a very close race. But after a late night surge at the polling booths, our new mayor elect is... Mr. Henry Deacon. Seriously? No, wait. I wasn't even on the ballot. I kinda started a write-in campaign. And someone gave you their official endorsement. You're welcome. I don't know... - What to say. - Say that you'll take the job because Zoe's boyfriend is the runner up. Clearly this is a surprise. I'm not one for making campaign promises. But I will say this. What makes Eureka special is not the ideal behind it, but you. This community. This family that I'm very proud to be a part of. And it's this family that I promise to protect no matter what.
