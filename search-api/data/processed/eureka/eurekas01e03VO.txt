How many classes do youget to skip for rehearsal? Last period every day. Including geometry.Love drama. That's what I thought. Do you remember my school playswhen I was a kid? Remember third grade,parade of nutrition? You remember my cucumber outfit? Do you? Yes. Zoe,you were the cutestcucumber in the garden. I was a tomato,actually. You weren't at parade of nutrition. I knew you were a vegetable. In fact,you weren'tat anything I ever did. Come on,it's not likeyou did anything in those plays. You just sort of sat therelooking... I sat there looking...? Come on. Zoe... work was crazy back then. But it's different here. There's a visitor at the door. It is different. It is!

I gotta grab my costume from vincent after school. And then I have rehearsaluntil 6:00. You asked vincentto make your costume? Sir,you should know. Your daughter'san incredible talent. Her audition,she wasblack body radiation in 1901. Change the paradigm. Let's roll. and a tomatois a fruit. Table food has always been community property. You remember thailand? It is goodto have you back. Stealing my breakfast. Well,don't get used to it. We finish this projectfor stark, we're off to geneva. no. I know,I know,I know. But jason doesn't likestaying anyplace for too long. And he does his best workon the road. Well,you can't arguewith results. Hey,listen. Jason would never ask,but... we could use your helpon this one. - What? - The wonder twinsdo not need my help. We do. We're stuck,and stark's already scheduled a D.O.D. Field test. Come on,it'll be fun. Like those all-nighterswe used to pull at jpl. Come on. All right.All right. Ta da!Fetching. I thought zoewas picking this up. Yeah,I'm saving itfor the trip. Be carefulwith the tentacles. I thought they weredoing shakespeare. Putnam's re-imagining it. He'S...he's a visionary. And I thought he wasjust annoying. Hands off the wife. I was just recruiting himto help us out on the body armor. just like old times.Speaking of which... - yeah.See you there? - Yes. Henry,I gotta flybefore stark has an aneurysm. Because we're being way overpaid to pinch hiton this project. But listen... if you canhelp us crack it, there's a very expensivebottle of scotch in it for you. A very expensive bottle of scotch. Done. Excuse me,I don't meanto be a hard-ass, but blockinga police vehicle... not a very good idea. My apologies,sheriff. - I'll get right on it. - All right. Nice costume. Healthy egoon your buddy. Oh,yeah. Jason has more patentsthan the fortune 500 combined. Universities throw grants at him just to rub up against their blackboards. What about his wife? Amazing.Amazing scientist. No,I meantwhat about his wife and you? Saw you talking. We're friends. When weren't you friends? Come on,man,it's obvious. A long time ago. We worked togetherfor years,and... I was best manat their wedding. And the restis ancient history. I'll catch you later. Kinetic absorption complete. Protective energyconversion field is holding. Napalm. There's a breakdownwhen the protective field tries to cross convert thermaland kinetic energy. That's exactly right. The army was promisedindestructible force-field body armorbased on your preliminary designs. Field demonstration's tomorrow. Even without the fix,this still could savethousands of lives. Not just soldiers.Police,fireman... the goal was to allow12 men to be able to clear out an entireinsurgent stronghold. Army's all stocked upon insurgent strongholds right now. You get paidto produce results. I get paid regardless. Field test is tomorrow. I know youwon't let me down. I'm going for a driveto clear my head. - We can adjustthe feedback loop. - Just... I haven't failedin 15 years. I'm not gonna start now. So... who's gonnamake the coffee? All right. Insert tab epsiloninto slot gamma. Okay. Who writes instructionsin greek letters,anyway? Greeks? I thought they weredoing shakespeare. midsummer night's dream. Putnam changed it. Putnam.Kid's a visionary. Yeah,well,I thinkhe has a crush on zoe. It's cute.It's all very normal. Normal is good. Oh,normal's very good.The more,the better. My mom used tomake my costumes. You used to do theater? Believe or not,carter, I didn't havechildhood dreams of becoming a commando. So you went from being toldto break a leg to actually breaking them. Enjoying yourself? Yeah,but I gottaget this to zoe before rehearsal. Trying to scoresome points. Tell her tobreak a leg for me. - Thanks. - Yes. approaching car 60 miles per hour. What do we have here? Sheriff,dr. Anderson is undera great deal of stress. We're in a dynamictherapy session. I'll bet you are. This isn'twhat you think,sheriff. My concern about thisis that you're doing 60 in a 30-mile-an-hour zone. Then why don't youjust write me a ticket? That's exactly whatI'm going to do. Just--I gottaget my ticket book. What areyou waiting for? Hey!Get... get back in the car. I'm sorry,sheriff. We can't be seen together. Well,you can geton your way just as soon as I... Got it. All right. Now,back in your car. Back in yours. We gonna have a problem? Looks that way. Jo,this is carter. We're gonna need some backupon old post road. Somebody's ina lot of trouble. Where's the perp? You called me. Why did you call me? I...can't remember. What do you got? You forgot the hamiltonian... no,I didn't.Just keep going. I got it. All right,so theelectrodynamics work. Force-field works. We just can't finishthe algorithm for the softwareto run the conversion. You know what? It's timefor more coffee. Dive in. There's no point. Jason willsolve it again,you'll see. Oh,come on.We can crack this. I've seen ita million times,henry. It's his gift. He'll just take it all in and just seize the answer. It's amazing. You don't sound amazed. Well,sometimesplaying second fiddle can be a little tiring. You are not secondto anything. You and ican solve this. Together. Okay. I didn't gofor that long a drive. - We pulled upall the research. - I double checked-- yeah.Wait,hold on. You got the force vectors. Or henry got the force vectors. That funkyrussian math you use is like a fingerprint. All right. R-d-T.That is it! It works. You son of A... you saved us again. You and henrylaid it all out. You solvedthe force-field problem. I couldn't havedone it without you. Look,my dad took my costume for reasonsI can't imagine. And I don't knowwhere he is. Zoe,no. You don't have your costume, you can't rehearse. I must see my vision. Puck!Where is my puck? I'm gonna kill my father.Speak! if we shadowshave offended... think but this,and all... is mended. Putnam,I can'tdo study hall. Think but thisand all is mended. that you have...but... that you havebut slumbered here. - Slumbered here,okay? - Okay. Sorry,zoe,can't breakthe rules for you. People will talk about us. Dad.Now the jet pack! Note to self. Adjust the fuel mixin the jet pack. Note to self:Find new puck. What foolsthese mortals be. It's calleda senior moment. Soon you'll be driving, just that oneright blinker going non-stop. No,I mean... I took my ticket bookout of the car for a reason. I need henry. Is this on the way toor from zoe's school? no.She's gonna kill me. She's right to kill me.Hey,jack! - Have you got anybody - who's lost time?Any reports of lost time? So,ten minutes? Maybe more. I was at global dynamics, so it could be section five. No,no,I was outby the farm. I must have called jo. We digitize all the audio, including the radio calls. Time code saysyou called me two minutes before I got there. jo,it's carter. I'm gonna need some backup on old post road. Somebody's in a lot of trouble. I don't remember saying that. But I must havepulled someone over. The ticket's gone. Carbon's missing too. Well,I can put thatunder a uv scope and it'll highl-- or you could just draw over it.Same thing. Okay,the first fourof the plate are... n-I-d-5. Are you serious? nid-563. I passed that caron the way out to see you. And jason was therewhen I lost time. Table on the left. You good? I'm good. You need to come with me. Carter! What did you do? Why did you shoot henry? I didn'T. I don'T...remember. I don'tremember anything. No. No,whatever happened, it wasn't jack's fault. There's no way I couldintentionally hurt henry. Protocol for dischargeof a weapon, injuring a civilian... and what does your protocolsay about the fact that nobody,absolutely nobody remembers what happened? I've got nothing. And all the caf?witnessesare fuzzy. The last thing I rememberI was in my office. Allison,we have tofigure this thing out. I'm sorry,carter. S.A.R.A.H.,Door. Sheriff,down in front. Please. What? Up and down.Up and down. I willbring them up and down. I am fearedin field and town. Goblin,lead themup and down. Here comes one now. I know I've beenforgetting a lot of stuff today. But I knowthis is my living room. rehearsal in progress. Sorry,I was justchecking her blocking. Oh,crap,I haveyour costume in my car. Yeah,luckily for you,I don't need it. Because I have a new partwith a new costume. I was trying to help. I know.Just don't ever do it again. Oh,what--that's not fair. promise. Putnam,put this on tape. Oh,come on. Okay. I promise. Clever little setup. that's a holographic generator I invented. Theater is aboutcreating illusion. The device helps merealize the vision. Zoe,take it fromwhere puck arrives. With oberon? Right. And puck uses his magic to make titania and bonham wake from their spell. Okay. Now when thou wakest with thine own fool's eyes... peep... did you wishto add something? No. Putnam,you're a genius. S.A.R.A.H.,Door. True. Putnam,can I offer a few small notes? Everybody's a critic. Spring cleaning? Somebody'sdone something to us. We just don't know what. He can make us,not see. Or,move through time,or, you know,just blank out. Okay... we all forgot? All of us? I mean,henry gets shot,and no one saw anything? Come on,jo. We're being...pucked with. Your argumentis so strong, it's almost petty of meto ask,how? He's got a thing. A thing. Yeah,a gizmo.A device. Has to be a device. Do you have a piece ofdevice-oriented evidence? No. But look. What's my ticket book doing there? It's gathering dust. That's right,I alwayshave it in my car. - In the trunk,on the floor. - And yet,here it is. I don't remember doing that. Okay,this is weird. Okay.A big one for you. Hey,you okay? Yeah.Just, just thinking. Well,less thinkingand more eating. I mean,vincent gave usway too much. Well,you know how muchI love tandoori. Hey,how are youreally feeling? Better.Now. What? This is weirder. jason anderson? I bet jason wasat caf?diem. That's why we were there. - We can't prove that. - No--vincent check the receipts. See if vincent made a mealfor jason today. Okay,and whereare you gonna go? I gotta go see a guyabout a thing. Device. Gizmo.Just... but there's somethingelse we have to do first. I heard they suspendedthe sheriff. It's not his faultwhat happened. - What did happen? - I'm not really sure. I have this blank spotthat I just cannot fill in. I know the feeling. What happened beforewith us? I've been tryingto remember. Did you say somethingor did I? Look,if we weremeant to be together, you wouldn't havewound up with jason. Whatever it was, an argument,a sulkthat went on too long, I'm just... I'm just grateful thatwe were able to salvage a friendship. Did we ever even kiss? Couldn't have beenthat great a kiss if we have to ask. I thought you were suspended. You worried to see me? You shot my friend,so yes. I figured it all out.I know what you're up to. In regards to... I know you have a device that can create a wormhole. Or,bend time.Or make you invisible. A worm-holing,time-bending,invisible-ing device that shields youfrom the mind. Yes,he said invisible-ing. Watch out! - Carter,you're already under suspicion! - That'S..no! Stop it! There,that's the devicethat invades your mind. It also starts my car. Okay,just let go of him. Get out of here while you can. Go! What does he have to doto get fired? Shoot anotherinnocent person? - Good question.Allison? - Okay,you guys do your job,I'll do mine. Carter! It's a little unorthodox, but I've dealt with worse. How are you so strong? I'm small,but I'm scrappy. I don't need therapy. Maybe not. But if it keeps you awayfrom jason anderson until after jason's D.O.D. Test this afternoon, I consider it time well spent. 50 minutes.Not a second less. Okay.Come on,jo. Oh,that's not my call,carter. I'll be at... caf?diemif you need anything. well,I've hadresistant patients, but you've seta new benchmark. I don't have timefor this. I understandhenry's doing well. Well,aside fromthe bullet hole He's doing great. How do you feelabout what happened? I don't know what happened. I mean,I wastrying to find out. But I can't do thatfrom in here. Sheriff... Beverly,no offense. I really,reallydon't wanna do this. - I get that. - Okay. But sincewe're both here, we might as welltalk about something. I mean,who knows? I might even be helpfulif you let me. Okay. All right. do you know any waythat someone could make people forget things? Hypnotherapy couldpotentially be used to trigger memory loss. No--no,nobody couldhypnotize me that fast. And it wasn't just me. It was everybodyat caf?diem. You'd be surprisedwhat the true masters can do. Do you knowjason anderson? I've met him in passing. He and henry go way back. I don't trust him. Do you trust henry? Of course. The shouldn't youtrust henry's opinion of dr. Anderson? I don't even know his opinionof dr. Anderson. I should ask him. That's not exactlywhere I was driving. Well,but we allget different things from therapy,right? I mean,I need to see henry. That would help mein my processing. That's what you'drecommend,right? - Under normal circumstances,yes,but - great.So I can go. Absolutely. In 46 minutes. don't wander off too far. The test is in a couple hours. Not to mentionthat crazy sheriff is still out there. He does seemfixated on you. Yeah,well,he is tryingto deflect his guilt over shooting henry. Do you think he intentionallyshot henry? Doesn't everyone? I mean,kim,come on. They found this nut jobstanding over our friend with a smoking gun. How else do youexplain that? I don't know. There seem to bean awful lot of things around here latelythat require an explanation. Solve it again. What? Looking at it,I know I can do it. I can solve it. But I wanna watch youdo it again. What did you do? Come in here,bring in some coffee, see that henry and ialready solved the problem? Erase the board,erase us, and stroll back in herelike it was the first time? Looking for this? Something is going on. There's just too manyweird coincidences for this to bejust about you losing it. Like,what,last nightI had a theory about your buddy jason. Jason? Yeah,like,um,that he had a device of some kind. Oh,well,that at leastnarrows it down. Oh,don't you start. You know,a devicethat could,like erase short bursts of time. Or how we perceive them. Almost like it can make usforget all about him. What? Not just about him. He could make us forget aboutwhatever he wants. Oh,and that's not crazy? I know what's going on. JasoN... jason anderson has a machinethat can wipe out short term memory. - How can you be so sure? - Because I built it. 20 years ago. I had a theorythat a properly modulated em burst could change the electrical properties of your brain cells. Unbind short-term memorybefore they can imprint as long-term memory. So you have one too. No,while I was developing itwith jason, I could never geta single test to work. Not one that you remember,anyway. Now I know what the sonof a bitch has been up to. Jo,this is carter. Look,I'm gonna needthat backup we talked about. Meet me in theglobal dynamics lobby. You're not storminginto a test session with one ofthe joint chiefs. Jason anderson has A...a device. A device. Oh,great,you too? He can eraseshort term memory. Why would he do that? Pull kim's personnel files.And jason'S. All the recordsback to college. That'll show us why. Make sure those arearmor-piercing rounds. I want the works. You sure about this? I've tested the force-fieldsix times. The pentagon sees this,they're gonna jam us into production right away. Good for us,good for global dynamics. And whose insane ideawas this? I don't remember. We were talking... I think it was minE. Must be. Kim is far too sensibleto try something like this. Good luck. Here. Here. Here. Oh,and look. Here. All of jason's breakthroughswere fields kim pioneered. This is jason andersonwe're talking about here. This is your friend,henry. I thought he was. But kim's the real genius. He's been stealing her workfor decades. What about all the otherresearch projects he's helped on? Oh,wait for the teamto make the breakthrough and then wipe them out. Cover your tracks and thenride in and save the day. Is 20 minutes at a time. How many timesdo you think? Kim... add it up,henry. He took a lot morethan 20 minutes of my memory. He took my life. I know. We'll make this right,kim. I already have. Carter,what areyou doing here? You're under suspension. we had A... it was... it was important. Might wannaput these on,sir. Clear the areafor a live ammo test. Okay,I would loveto stay here and play with you twoall day. But I have work to do. Jo. You have no ideawhy I'm here,do you? What-- hidden camera. Saw the whole thing. Initiate test on my mark. Three,two... one. Don't! Kim,wait. Don'T.Please. I am leaving. I can run and you won'teven know why you should chase me. You haven't run away from anythingin your life. How do you know? I don'T. I don't know anythinganymore. Maybe I cheated on him. How many times did icatch jason cheating on me and he made it all better?No. Maybe I left him. How many times did itell jason,"I'm leaving," and I walk out that doorand, boom,none of it happened? Whatever he took from you... from everybody,is unforgivable. But you cannotkill him for it. Henry,what did he takefrom you? Why can't we remember... if we ever even kissed? Remember our biggest fight? Remember whenyou told jason it was okayto ask me out? Do you? More than 20 years ago.I... we had to move on. I had to... henry,if he stole...us. Stark,what's going on? Someone's about tolose their job,general. Nathan,there's somethingyou should know. Sheriff,you're standing in the way of science! Jason,camera never lies. My daughter taught me that. I had jo rig me up with this digital video. We've just finished watchingthe surveillance feed. We know aboutyour memory wiper. Which is a devicethat henry built and you stole. A memory wiper. Stark,are youlistening to this? Can you have this maniachauled off? I outsmarted you. Now I knowyou're hallucinating. Activate the damn test. I get that. Okay,fair enough. I mean,you're 100% certain that you're smarter than me. But are you smarterthan kim? I mean,she's the one who programmed your very fancy little vest. I double checkedthe algorithms. Sure. And if jason andersonis the genius everybody says he is, then there's no wayyou're in any danger. But if kim'sthe real genius, then you have no way of knowing if she sabotaged that vest. But if you'resmarter than her, then there's no wayshe could have figured it out. If she had a problem, she would have said something. Maybe she did and youjust don't remember it. There's no wayshe could play you,right? I mean,you're jason anderson. You're the genius,not her. So let's firethis puppy up. No!No! I think it's timefor you to go,jason. Stark,come on. Cash that check quick. It's the last oneyou're gonna see. General. How could you do this? I just wanted what you had. You and henry. I did what I had to do,but I gave you a good life. No.You took it. What can I say,henry? I'm sorry. - If... - I hadn't have comewhen I did... he would have been fine. Even though you stole my life, I couldn't take yours. The vest works. I just turned downthe power so you'd getbanged up a bit. Is that right? Even I saw that one coming. Henry. Hey,I thought maybeyou changed your mind. No,I hadsome thinking to do. Sure. You know,a lot's happened. If you don't want to do this,I understand. Stark offered mea position at G.D. So I'd stay here. - Are you... - considering it? - Yeah. - That's good. Well,for the town. I mean,no questionyou'd be an asset. I remember that. Where are mycybernetic fairies? Fairies,assemble.Excuse me. Two seconds,two seconds. Hey,these are for you. - Dad,I'm psyching up. I know--I just wanted youto know that I'm here. This time. You're gonna be great. break a leg. Thanks,dad. If we shadowshave offended, think but thisand all is mended. That you havebut slumbered here. And these visionsdid appear. And as I am an honest puck, if we have unearned luck... now to 'scapethe serpent's tongue, we will make amends 'ere long. Else the puck a liar call. So good night unto you all. Give me your handsif we be friends. And robin shallrestore amends. Oh,she was amazing! And her costume is terrific. Oh,my god,all the dramathey put us through as parents, and these are the moments we're gonna remember the most. If we're lucky. -------------------------- Proudly Presents -------------------------- Sync: YTET-²¤ÂÜÐ¡Óã
