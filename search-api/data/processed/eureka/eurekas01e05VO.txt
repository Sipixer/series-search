Whatcha doing ? I'm the sheriff. I'm... sheriffing. You were supposed to meet me at Global a half an hour ago for your physical. Yeah. Good news. I gave myself the physical, and I'm in perfect health. All right, it's mandatory. You can't be insured by Global without one. Yeah, now's not a good time. We're really, really, super busy. Okay, this is the third time you've put this off. - What's up ? - Do you really want to know ? No, I just enjoy our morning banter. Because I don't want to die. Isn't that the whole point of taking the physical, Carter ? No, that's tempting fate. Insure a cop today, he takes a bullet tomorrow. What, are you superstitious ? It's not superstition if it's true. Which it is. You know, you're not grasping the point here. If you don't take the physical, you don't have a job. So strip. We'll just do the physical here. - Excuse me ? - We all have a past. This was mine. So... time's a-wastin'. Drop'em. I'm gonna need to see some credentials. If... you are a doctor. Was a doctor before Kevin was born. But I still think I remember where all the main parts are. So drop your pants. Yeah, no. There'll be no pant-dropping without a nice dinner and many, many cocktails. - Deputy Lupo. - This is Carlson.</i> - Okay, calm down. - Who is it ? Just breathe. Okay, get a paper bag, and... - Breathe into it. - Who is it ? Carl Carlson. 911s all the time. We can ignore it. Not on my watch. - Carter. - Sorry, Allison. Gotta go. Protect and serve. Wait for it. Where am I going, exactly ? - Carl Carlson ? - You're not Sheriff Cobb. No. Sheriff Cobb ret... retired. I took his place. There was a town meeting. And... everything. - I gave a speech. - I don't get out much. I'm gathering. - Jack Carter. - Do you have any idea how many strains of bacteria are transmitted by hand-to-hand contact ? No. But I'm guessing you do. I'm really sorry. This isn't gonna work out. I need Sheriff Cobb. - You're still not Sheriff Cobb. - Yeah, we established that. But... since I'm here, what is your emergency, exactly ? I have to get to work. You called 911 to bum a ride ? It's a very big day for me. Sheriff Cobb always used to give me a ride on very big days. - Driving makes me very nervous. - It's okay, Carl. I'm here. - Client of yours ? - Six years running. Why didn't you tell me that there's a new sheriff ? It came about rather unexpectedly, and I didn't want to panic you until we had time to process-- Now I'm panicking because this is a defining day in my research, and I have absolutely no way of getting to work. I'm sure Sheriff Carter will be happy to drive you. Yeah. You know, he is a former U.S. Marshal. - Yeah. - Yeah ? Okay. Only if he puts the lights on. That was surprisingly easy. He must like you. Beverly, I don't run a taxi service. He's on the verge of a major breakthrough. - More like a major breakdown. - He's pioneering the field of cellular regeneration. You would be helping him help everyone else if you do this. What are we waiting for ? You're making me late. I used to have a real job. You're doing a good thing. Carl ! And remember, lights but no siren. Right. Okay, got you here in one piece. Next  time, if you wouldn't mind cleaning out your car There won't be a next time. Best of luck. What do you mean ? You're not coming to my lab ? Well, no. Today's the day I go for all the marbles. - It's gonna be-- - I got a... thing. And then I have another thing. - Because Sheriff Cobb always used to. - Okay, for the last time, Carl, I'm not Sheriff Cobb. I'm an officer of the law, and I just can't... - Carter ! - ... get enough - of the science in this town. - Oh, good. - Yeah, so what is this breakthrough ? - It's remarkable. I am so tired of that man. - What is it with you and Carter ? - Not Carter. Carlson. The man's been here for six years. He hasn't produced anything. He's literally more trouble than he's worth. Is  this really necessary ? I can't risk introducing new strains of bacteria into the test area. Could you step back, please ? I said... I said step back. I am attempting to achieve adhesion affinity gradient in the proximal blastemal cells in human tissue. I'm glad someone's on that. Yes, you know, when a lizard loses its tail, it grows back. It's called cellular regeneration. I'm trying to do the same thing with people. Oh, that's cool. Beverly encourages me to take risks and not wimp out when I'm on the verge of something new. Moment of truth. One drop. One drop... only. - Uh-oh. - What do you mean, "Uh-oh ?" If you'd come to my office for your physical, you might not have been hurt physically. Well, Dr. Blake, if you hadn't tried to give me a physical, then I wouldn't have had to go through such extreme measures to avoid it. You got off lucky, Carter. Well, not as lucky as him. However, it could be the new tungsten alloy rotor I installed in the centrifuge. It could be... you know what ? Dichloride heptoxide is unstable when heated. And that's what probably happened. In fact, I'm sure that's what happened. Probably. Allison, I'm gonna need form 395-2C. - Nathan. - My call. He's all yours, Carter. All mine ? What's... what's... Form 395-2C ? Revocation of government clearances and property. Carl is being fired. And it is your job as sheriff to oversee the safe and orderly removal of all ex-employees from Eureka. What does that entail ? Technicians from Global Dynamics will pack up anything that belongs to Dr. Carlson and confiscate anything that doesn't. They'll review his personal documents and redact any classified information. Dr. Carlson will then be scanned to make sure he's not concealing any classified materials. And a Global Dynamics human resource counselor will provide Dr. Carlson with a new résum. Replacing his tenure at Global with a plausible government research project, complete with applicable references. Every molecule of my life has been erased. That's our goal. Have a good day. Don't... touch me ! - I'm really sorry about this, Carl. - Yeah. Where am I gonna sleep ? - I'm sure Beverly has a place. - No, she's not returning my calls. Besides, I cannot sleep in a public bed. If Sheriff Cobb were here, he'd  let me stay with him. But... he's not here. All my stuff. Carl, I happen to live in a hermetically sealed military bunker. Perfect ! Thank you ! I'll just call Beverly to let her know where I'm staying. If I had a phone, because I don't have, because they took it ! So I don't have - Can I borrow ? - Yeah, I... got a... So you moonlighting at Staples ? Form 395-2C. Carl has to complete these before he's allowed to leave Eureka. Well, so much for your paperless society. All these'll get filed at the D.O.D. They're not quite down with the "save a tree" mentality as of yet. Oh, and that's for you. Oh, yeah, it'll hurt a lot more if you try to take it off. What the hell is it ? Wireless body sensor. In other words, portable physical. It's taking constant measurements of your vital signs, organ functions, and blood chemistry. - I feel so violated. - Oh, I'll be monitoring you. - Allison ! - Blood pressure. Make sure he signs every page. Beverly, it's Carl again. Please pick up if you're there. I know you told me that with risks come great rewards. Well, I'm having a little trouble seeing what those rewards... are at this moment. Beverly, listen. I'm being redacted.</i> I'm being exiled out of Eureka.</i> You need to call me. Actually, you have to call Carter's phone,</i> not me. Cause they took my phone.</i> That  was him. This is an unfortunate setback. It's okay. Carl Carlson may no longer be a viable candidate for our objectives. However, a new target has been identified. - You asked to see me, sir ? - Yes, Fargo. I need you to lead the investigation on the explosion in Dr. Carlson's lab. Thank you, sir. I'm--I'm honored. Just keep the findings between us until I tell you otherwise. On the down-low. Got it. - S.A.R.A.H., door. - Welcome, Sheriff Carter Hey, what's up ? Organic chemistry's gonna kill me. What happened to you ? Uh, organic chemistry almost killed me. We're gonna have a houseguest tonight, so remember to pick up. Good going, Dad. Is it Allison or Jo ? What ? Well, see, I have a bet going with Vincent. See, if I win, then he's going to make me breakfast in bed for a month. And if he wins, I wait tables. Neither. Stop wagering on my love life. - Or lack thereof. - Right, so who's this lucky person ? It's a researcher who got canned today. He'll be over just as soon as he finishes off some paperwork. Which could take a while. Don't. Carter. It's Carl. Oh, hey, Carl. You done already ? No. Listen, I wanna thank you for the generous offer, but I don't think I'm gonna be needing a place to sleep tonight. Carl, where are you ? I'm just cleaning. Cleaning what ? Your place is empty. The railing of the... Da Vinci Bridge. Don't move. I'll be right there. Hey, Carl. Hi. You wanna come back here ? Why ? My  whole life's a failure. Blew up six years of research. Got fired. And end up with nothing but my toothbrush. All before lunch. Okay. This was a setback. My work... is my life. And without it, I'm nothing. Oh, you're something. You're... a nice guy. I irritate you. I irritate everybody. It's not surprising. I'm irritating. You're... colorful. Don't patronize me, Sheriff. All right. If you're going, - hold on. - What are you doing ? No, no, no ! When I get nervous, I get very confused. - If I get confused, I might-- - Fall. Yes. I'm glad you understand. I don't think you wanna do this. I get it. I mean, you've had a really rotten day. And--and, uh, everything sucks. Okay. Why don't we just... climb back over and talk about it ? You know, go grab a beer. Make fun of Stark. What do you say ? I've never grabbed a beer with anybody in my life. Today's the first drink of the rest of your life. If you don't jump. You think we could be friends ? I think that's what the beer is for. What do I do ? I don't know what to do. I can't do it till I get drunk. Okay, okay. - I gotta do it really fast. - Give me your hand. Okay. Carter. Carter, are you all right ? Not sure. Still taking stock. How did you know ? Well, your blood pressure spiked, your adrenals went in overdrive, and your white cell count suggests you may have broken something. I fell down. A long way down. Are you sure you're okay ? Where's Carl ? What do you mean, "Where's Carl ?" I thought you were staying on top of him. Believe me, I was. I'll call you later.</i> Henry ? - Henry. - Carl ? Listen. I heard the news, and... - I have to talk to you. - What happened to your head ? - What ? - Your head ! Yeah, I took a bit of a tumble. In more ways than one. Let  me clean that up for you so it doesn't get infected. No. With those hands ? I don't think so. - Do you have a sink ? - Sure, in the back. There should be some sanitizing lotion and disinfectant in there, too. Oh, my God. Oh, God. We have preliminary data on the lab accident. Looks like there was a momentary breach of the EMG. It coincided with the accident in Dr. Carlson's lab. The pulse wave from the ultrafuge probably caused an electromagnetic disturbance. That's not all. We're detecting exotic atomic particles inside his lab that I've never seen before. And the breach appears to have come from below his lab. In Section 5. Hey, Carter. You okay ? Yeah, yeah. Think I... well, I may have cracked a rib or three. What ? How ? Funny you should ask. It's a good story. A hypothetical guy falls maybe 50 feet, lands flat on the ground. And then another guy weighing 180 falls and lands on top of him. Okay, what is the chance of the hypothetical guy getting up and walking away ? Whether I use single-case probability or an application of Bayesian statistics, the outcome is the same. Slim to none. Yeah, that's what I thought. Look, this "hypothetical guy." - Is that you ? - No. I landed on the hypothetical guy, though. Uh, it's Carl Carlson. What ? Carl was just here. I mean, he did look pretty beat up, but he certainly didn't look like a guy who fell 50 feet. Doesn't make any sense. I gotta find him. - You might want to find a doctor. - Yeah, yeah. Vincent. A beer. Okay. But you don't drink alcohol, and I don't serve you anymore since you brought in the health inspector. - There was a fly in my soup. - You sensed a fly in your soup. I may have overreacted. Yeah, you overreact a lot, mate. That's why you're out. What number of animal distress calls I've made to your house ? - I'd have canned you years ago. - Yes, Taggart, you're right. I used to be a man afraid of everything. But. All that will change. Starting now. Beverly. Carl. Oh, my God. What happened ? Are you okay ? I'm better than okay. I'm really sorry that I couldn't take your calls. - Global revoked your therapy privileges. - Perfectly understandable. Why would you take my calls ? I was a loser. But I'm a new man now, Beverly. You told me to take risks, and you were right. You're touching my skin. Without gloves. Without disinfectant. Fear kept me from living, Beverly. Kept me from trying the things I wanted to try and doing the things I wanted to do. But something extraordinary happened to me today, and all that's changed. I wanted to say... thank you. I've always wanted to do that. Who hasn't ? Even I've thought about it. And now, Beverly, if you'll excuse me. Good night, boys. Dr. Stark. Stark ? Carlson. I would've thought you'd have been redacted by now. Oh, I have been. You took away the only thing that I ever cared about. You're gonna regret it. You and I both know I should've done that a long time ago. Carl ! I've been looking everywhere for you. What happened ? Carl, no ! Carlson. No job is worth this. What do you think this is worth ? Spontaneous cellular regeneration. The implications are staggering. Surgeries, amputations, organ transplants, all could become a thing of the past. It could change the entire face of medicine. Think how much relief this will give everyone. Well, except for surgeons. Oh, and hospitals. And oh, the... the... guys who make Band-Aids. An amazing transformation. A little too amazing. Carlson's not just a researcher anymore. He's the research. He's finally come through. I'd think you'd be happy. I'll be the first one to jump up and down if he can replicate the results. But until then, he needs to be studied. Dr. Stark. I have some... numbers for you to sign off on. Thank you. If you'll excuse me. I think we've found the source of the exotic particles. There was an electromagnetic breach of the floor above Section 5. - Which room ? - I can't say. The room doesn't appear on any of the published schematics. It's classified, and I'm not. So unless you wanna up my security clearance. Here, give it to me. Oh, that's not possible. There's 20 layers of concrete and charged-particle barricades surrounding the... room. What's in there that's so dangerous ? When I perfect this formula, I can make you invincible. That's a very generous offer, Carl, but I think I'll have to pass. Really ? Why ? Think about it. You won't be afraid of death anymore. I'm not sure that's a good idea. Besides, fear's what keeps you sharp, right ? Buy me a beer sometime. Tickets to a ballgame, something. I've never been to a ballgame. All that spilled food on the ground fermenting and beer and filth. That's what used to make my skin crawl when I used to think about it. When you put it like that, it's no wonder. It's interesting. It just doesn't bother me anymore. In a strange way, it's almost appealing. Ever since the accident, I've had this bizarre life craving. Sounds like you feel pregnant. Well, in a strange way, actually, I do. It's like a light's been turned on. It's... like I've been reborn. Just came for the patch. Your exam's over. - So I passed ? - Yes. You are officially insured by Global Dynamics Life and Health. I still say it's tempting fate. Now you can go get your ribs checked out. You... You do at least have them wrapped. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Do you have an Ace bandage ? No. Fresh out. Yes, you do, Sheriff. In your gym bag upstairs.</i> Bedroom closet. - That's really disconcerting. - Yeah, you get used to it. - Traitor. - Come on. - Here you go. - Okay. I'm worried about Carl. I think there... something's going on with him. I mean, besides the invincibility thing. Well, he seems to think it's a good thing. Can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I'm gonna... miss the old Carl. And now I'm gonna have to get your head checked, too. He's not right. Henry's running a full battery of tests, so hopefully it'll tell us what happened. - Yeah. - Okay, so how's that ? That's better. Good. Well, maybe now you can get some sleep. - Yeah. Here, come on. Lay down. - All right. - Come on. - Yeah. That's the one thing that Fargo got right about this place, is the mattress. It's a... a prototype for a body-contouring silicone. Really ? - Oh, my God. - Yeah, I know. - I need one of these. - I think everybody needs one of these. All right, I'm gettin'up. Okay. All right, I need to get out of here. Okay. And now some regener to jam. It's not healing. I've done everything exactly the same way. I don't understand. My cells are regenerating. What am I doing wrong ? Good morning, Zoe. I win. Hey. Hey. Hey. - I think I fell asleep. - I think you might've. I have to pick up Kevin from his friend's house. I had a purse. Your purse is downstairs, Ms. Blake.</i> All right, that's really disconcerting. You know what ? Put that on. Thanks. - So... - See you at Global. Yeah. Allison ? Thanks for stopping by. Yeah. I've reviewed all the test results. And it's absolutely amazing. You won't believe what's going on with Carl's blood work. - Hey, good morning, guys. - Morning. Morning. Weren't you wearing that yesterday ? No. Just similar. Oh, don't look at me. I wear the same thing every day. I found traces of radiation in his white cells, and his exotic particle count is off the charts. Is there any chance that the explosion could've caused that radiation to leak from an adjacent lab ? Not that I'm aware of. Well, whatever Carl was exposed to, it's created a spontaneous genetic mutation that is accelerating rapidly. We just have to figure out what those mutations are doing to him. Whatever it takes, Henry. What am I doing wrong ? Dr. Carlson, here are the biliary epithelial cells you requested. I asked for nonparenchymal progenitor cells ! The lab tech said that Dr. Carlson attacked him telekinetically. I wouldn't discount it. Seriously ? When I first looked at Carl's blood work, I thought the explosion had somehow reprogrammed his cells to spontaneously regenerate. - It didn't ? - No, his cells aren't doing the work. His brain is. Here. Take a look at this. Now, most people use maybe 10% of their brain at any one time. This mutation has allowed Carl to access all 100% of his brain. Okay, well, maybe I'm only accessing 5% of mine, but that would just make him smarter, right ? Like, not invincible. The mind has powers that are completely uncharted. Tibetan monks have been using meditation to promote healing for centuries. Maybe one day, man will evolve to the point that he no longer needs doctors. He'll be able to heal himself with thought. But not for thousands of years. Tens of thousands, even. If ever. Carl is already there. And he's still evolving. But into what ? Hey, buddy. I guess you heard about the incident. Yeah. I don't understand what's happening. It appears that you were exposed to something during the explosion that's altered your brain functioning. That is why you're able to heal so... quickly. So... my research is a failure. - I didn't do this. - No. No, yeah, you did. Just... with your mind. I guess that's why I can't get this out of my head. - What is it ? - I don't know. I have no idea. It's like a song that you can't think of the name of. And I'm starting to... sense things. Feelings and... thoughts. Do you know what this is ? No. Dr. Carlson, I think it's time we went somewhere to... run some more specific tests. Why ? Determine what's happening to you. I think you want to study me. The way you want to study that. Dr. Carlson. I think he's evolving a little faster than we thought. Beverly. Carl. - Scared me. - Something happened to me. It's happening to me. It's something that I didn't create, and I can't control it. - It's okay. - I feel connected to everything at the same time. And I'm... I'm... seeing images. And I'm hearing thoughts. Which is remarkable. But... it's a little scary. Come. I'm here. Whatever you need, Carl, I can help you. You don't want to help me. You want me to help you. To get into Section 5. I want to do what's best for you, Carl ! I'm so stupid. I thought that you cared for me. I do care for you, Carl. You're a liar. Carl. I always knew he'd snap one day.</i> He's creepy. So much promise. I thought he was strange before.</i> Carl. Carl, slow down. Carl. I'm a friend. Remember ? I thought I'd created something incredible. I know. But it was something at Global, some... Strange kind of radiation ? How did you know ? Because I was... thinking of it ? Loud and clear. Okay, that's a little disturbing. So then you know that the only place that can help you is Global. I go back there, they'll never let me leave. Trust me. Carl, you gotta trust me. I'll take it from here, Carter. We're doing just fine, thanks. - Carter. - Nathan. Okay, the two of you just take a breath. Dr. Carlson. Let me help you. Before it's too late. You don't wanna help me. You want to use me. Why would I want to do that ? Because you think I'm the key. The key to what ? - Nothing. - To Section 5, to his... precious artifact. What is he talking about ? I have no idea. The sad thing is you really don't know what it is, do you ? You are obsessed with this object you know absolutely nothing about. Do you ? Carl, you can't leave. Wait ! Carter ! Carter, damn it. He's not breathing. Call for help. We're losing him. I know what to do. Get him back to Global, now ! Please let me call in a trauma surgeon. It's not working. I have to get closer to it. The artifact. - You can't. - It's the only way. We have to go to Section 5 now. Wait here. What ? No ! I'm coming with you. - You're not authorized. - Nathan, this is ridiculous. - The man is dying. - Ally. If we're gonna do this, we have to do it alone. Trust me. That's close enough. Sit him down. Hey ! Welcome back, Sheriff. Come on, Carter. You're okay ? There we go. Come on. Get him to the infirmary. Yes. Carlson, wait. Don't do it, Carl. It's gonna be all right. It'll destroy you. I'm not afraid. Carl, please. I have to know. What is it ? One day you will know. The question is will you be ready ? I am. You sure you want to do this ? Absolutely. We've waited long enough. Because now I'm having second thoughts. - This was your idea. - Exactly. And... And I don't want you to blame me for talking you into it. If there's one thing I've learned from Carl, it's to take some risks. Now, come on. Let's do it. Okay. Okay. Just sign and date here. You will be 100% insured. Well, without Carl around, maybe I won't be needing it. Where'd he get reassigned, anyway ? I don't know. Nathan had it classified. Figures. I'm gonna miss him. All right, here goes nothing. What made you change your mind ?
