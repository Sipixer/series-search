How do you figure? You're making me late for work. So you're justice? Yeah,I'm justice. Sheriff,do you need your coffee? What do you think? Pouring now. Hurry up,zoey. S.A.R.A.,If this is the house of the future,how come there's only one bathroom? Is there a shortage of bathrooms in the future? where is it? Where's what? Your hair. Where's my hair? You,um-- what did you do to it? Let me guess.You don't like it. No,I didn't say that. So you do like it. I didn't say that either. Figures. Now,come on... I mean,did it even occur to you to ask me? You always say no. No,I don'T. So if I would've asked you,you would've said yes? We would've discussed it. And then you would've said no. That's not the point. Okay,I gotta go to school. We're not done discussing this. And don't forget you've a therapy session with beverly today. About that,look-- no about that.We had a deal. Well,I want to renegotiate. Well,you should've thought of that before you set your head on fire.You're going. Fine. And wear a hat. Judging by those dark circles,I'd say iron deficiency. Mmm,more like sleep deficiency. This dark's killing me. Well,this will pep you up. Eggs-odus over easy with spinach and ginseng reduction. Eggs-oxus of cnidas? The greek astronomer? Honestly,I don't know why I bother. Oh,my god. Callister raynes? Hello,vincent. I thought you dropped off the face of the planet. Close enough. so what brings you back? Guess I was feeling a little homesick. Have you seen her yet? Who? Please.You know exactly who I'm talking about. Jo. Not yet. You think she's still mad? Well,she's still jo,so... Listen,callister-- for what it's worth,I never believed you were responsible. And I don't think jo did either. But you probably don't want to talk about that right now. What about stark?Does he know you're here? Any minute now. ladies,gentlemen,distinguished colleagues-- thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to join me here today. But I assure you-- dr.Stark,I need to talk to you. Excuse me for a moment. I swear to god,fargo.The world better be on fire. Actually... pretty close. I'm sorry,but something's come up that demands my immediate attention. We'll have to continue this at a later time. Sync:fisherchen Proudly Presents Hey,george jetson,how's it going? Looks like some kind of program error fried one of the chips. You're gonna have to give me a minute to put in a new one. All right,well,hurry up. Traffic cop is so not in my job description. You must not have read the fine print. But on the bright side,the orange really brings out your eyes. Enjoying yourself? You have no idea. So? Oh,um-- jo's filling out the security reports as we speak. That's what you said yesterday. Because that's what she told me yesterday. Hey,stop'n slow! All set. Let me know if it gives you any more trouble. Thanks,henry. So,come on,I'll let you buy me a cup of coffee. It's free. Well,in that case.I'll buy. Okay. I think this could be our thing. Don't push it,traffic boy. We don't have a thing. It's freezing in here. Here. Take that. That's much better. Are you enjoying yourself? I have no idea. Sorry,guys.The cpu's out on the thermostat. Just roll with it. Um,buttered rum,malt cider,hot toddy? Is that christmas music? I said just roll with it. Okay. So,admit it. We have a thing. You got to be kidding me. Uh,ouch,all right. Not you. Him. callister raynes in the flesh. Just strolls in here this morning like nothing ever happened. Who's callister raynes? He's a computer programmer that nathan brought in for a classified project. Brilliant kid.Everyone loved him. I'm sensing a "but. " But the two of them had a falling out. A week later,nathan's lab was destroyed by a fire. Callister was the prime suspect. Uh-oh,show time. Jo,those reports aren't gonna write themselves. You've no idea. This is-- hey,jo. I was just about to stop by and see if you-- that's for coming back. And that's for leaving. I'm back to those reports. No rush. They've a history. I gathered. What? Taking the christmas theme a bit far,don't you think? This isn't my doing. Callister raynes,right? Yes. I don't think we've been formally introduced. I'm jack carter. I'm the new sheriff. How are you doing? Did you need something,sheriff? I was just stopping to see if you were okay. Oh,right. I'll be fine. Where you headed? I'm going to beverly'S. Really? Because that's back that way. Right. Of course. Here,hop in.I'll give you a lift. No,I like to walk. Seriously? s2 to s1.Repeat.S2 to s1.Over. Jo,it's just you and me. You can feel free to be a little less formal. Over. There's an electrical problem at osborn's farm on the way into town.Over. See,was that so hard? You didn't say "over. " I know.It's gonna bug her all day long. I heard you were back. Figured you'd find your way here sooner or later. I was curious how much you kept. I probably should've destroyed it all after you left. But,uh... I couldn'T. I didn't realize you were so sentimental. You can't be here,callister. We can't risk it. I know. Then why did you come back? Because something is very wrong. when you're done with the communicate,you're supposed to say "over. " Uh,forgot.Sorry. Not gonna hit me,are you? What happened between callister and me was private. Yeah,I gathered that from the way you handled it so discreetly in that very public caf? Yeah. So,what's the problem here? Osborn said he had a power surge this morning. And his electrical fence is not functioning. Would a fence like this run off a computer? Almost everything in eureka does. Why? Well,I think I feel a hunch coming on. Come on! Jo. Yeah? Could've told me it was magnetized. Oh,I forgot. Sorry. Jo! I'll go see if I can shut it down. Oh,good. I was worried everyone wouldn't get a chance to see this. Hey,allison. Um,what are you doing here? Uh,I heard there was another glitch. Yeah,yeah-- got it under control. So I'll catch you up on it later. What are you hiding? Nothing. No,no-- allison,don't! hi. Hi. The fence is,um,magnetized. Yeah,I see that. You know what?I think I can,um... what are-- what are you doing? I'm just trying to-- stop it. But I can-- let me just-- oh. I'm trying to shut it off. Uh-- jo,jo,the-- is trying to shut off the fence. Oh,okay. So,how are you? Fine.You? Good. Good. So these glitches are becoming a little worrisome. How so? Well,you know. Three today. Two's a coincidence.Three's a pattern. oh,I can-- thanks. It was my pleasure. Uh,guys... I shut the fence down a while ago. Um,I'm gonna,um-- okay,yeah. Central processing unit from the computer that regulates the fence. It's fried. Thanks,jo. Allison! Wait up. Uh,you might want to come to henry'S. I have a feeling you're gonna want to hear this. How long? A few weeks. Maybe more. How bad? I've been losing control. It's getting worse. Okay,I want you to stay here. No. I didn't come all the way back to be left alone. It is too dangerous for you to be wandering around town. Dangerous for who? Listen to me. I'm not going through all that again. Not after everything I sacrificed to help you leave. You're not the only one who sacrificed. I'll be back as soon as I can. There's your problem. That's what's been messing up everything on the internet. Is this our glitch? Glitch?No,that's a virus. You guys should've switched to macs. It's a little bit more complicated than that. You see,eureka has its own operating system. One that's unlike any in the world. Viruses don't just happen. They have to be written by someone who is intimately familiar with the operating system. Like,oh... say a computer programmer who used to live in eureka? Point taken.Henry,how dangerous is this? Well,the entire system is run on a wireless internet. The traffic light,the ac,the electric fence. if the virus isn't stopped,whoever's behind it may be able to get access to something more dangerous than traffic lights. All right,how do you want to deal with this? Why don't you talk to stark? See if callister contacted him.And what he knows about the virus. Jo. Carter,please.I'm almost done,okay? It's not the security checks. I need the file on the fire that callister was accused of setting. He wasn't accused. He was suspected and we cleared him. Well,maybe he wasn't involved with what happened then. But I'm pretty sure he's involved with what's happening now. Carter,I know this is gonna sound weird,especially coming from me. But he's not like that. And I hope that you're right. But you know as well as I do that I can't stop an investigation just because you're involved with some guy. I wouldn't ask you to. I just thought you might want my opinion. Jo... I gotta get back to these reports. Hey. Oh,hello. Guest or patient? Excuse me? Are you a guest or patient? I have a room here,if that's what you mean. Yes,but is it padded? I'm a guest. Cool. Patient. Not like I'm crazy or anything. Actually,my dad's making me go here. Apparently,I have "issues" with "authority. " And "listening," and... I don't know.Other stuff. I wasn't really paying attention,so... you two don't get along? He thinks I'm a delinquent. I'm just a product of my environment. Believe me,I know that feeling. I'm callister. Zoe. Nice to meet you,zoe. I like your hair. Thank you,callister. Thank you,duncan. I was able to reschedule the demonstration for 3:00. Good,because you're gonna be running it. What?Why? I'm taking the rest of the day off. Well,that's got to be a first. Allison. Fargo,give us a minute. Did you know callister raynes was coming back? I didn't even know he was here. Really? So he hasn't contacted you. I think that was implied by my first answer. Now,if you'll excuse me,allison. Are you all right? I'm just feeling a little under the weather. You haven't taken a sick day since I've known you. You always told me to take better care of myself. There's a virus on the internet,nathan. Really? Eureka has a virus. Okay,I'll take care of it. Right now,I've got to go. Nathan,what is going on,really? Nothing is going on,all right? Really. I'll take care of the virus. well,this inventory list doesn't make any sense. I mean,you can't tell me that in stark's top secret lab all they had was the standard stuff listed here. It was a fire. Probably burned. Well,that's exactly my point. Anything lost in a fire has got to be documented as destroyed. Unless it's classified. That's a good point. Can you run callister's name through your security check? Fine. But you're not gonna find anything. Nothing came up. It's worth a shot. No,I mean nothing came up. It's like somebody's gone in here and erased all his records. Hold on.I'm getting a fax. This guy isn't who he says he is. He's been lying about everything. Someone's been lying,all right. Son of a bitch! Hello. I'm sorry I'm late. Zoe,you look,um,lovely. Thank you. Your room is all ready,callister. If you need anything else,you just let me know. The lies stop right here,right now. I know what you did. Identity theft. Credit card fraud. What the hell were you thinking? Look,the credit card company will cover it. The most she's gonna have to pay is like,50 bucks. That's not the point. Adjeet,um... ghandahavi shouldn't have to pay a penny for you. I'll pay her back. I thought we were past this. We-- I am. Look,that was from before I even came here. Exactly! And when you showed up,what did I say? Look at me!What did you promise me? No more secrets. Exactly. When you showed up,it was all cards on the table. No secrets.That was our deal. And yet you sat there and lied to my face. And for what? Shopping spree,a trip to bermuda,some online gambling-- what was it? What was it that-- I bought a bus ticket! To eureka. You had to steal it? Huh?You couldn't come to me for help? Yeah,right. Don't do that. That's not fail. I haven't always been the world's greatest dad. But I've always been there for you when you needed help. Oh,so you're saying that if I said I wanted to come live here,you would just make it happen. Of course! Well,I guess we're both liars now. I can't do this anymore. I'm done,zoe. Dad-- done! Not a word. Is he always that angry? We're working on it. It's all right. Callister. Damn it. Hit me. I'm cutting you off. I think three's your limit. I don't pay you to think,I pay you to pour. Actually,you don't pay me at all. What's going on,zoe? Oh,I don't know. My dad hates me. Why,what did you do? See,now why do you automatically assume that it's my fault? Is it? No. Okay-- yes. But not the point. I screwed up. Bad. And now he's sending me back to L.A. He said that? Yes. Okay,no. But I can read between the lines. He said he was done with me. Zoe,he's not going to send you away. You're right. And you know why? Because I'm not going to let him. Good for you. Bye,vince. Carter,where the hell have you been? I don't want to talk about it. Are you okay? Yeah,um... could we just work now? Really want to work. All right. Get anything from stark? Not really.He said he didn't even know callister was here. What happened when you mentioned the virus? He gave me this weird look.And then he just ran off. That's not at all suspicious. Yeah. And you'd think he'd be worried about the effects on global. Well,maybe he's more worried about something else. Or someone else,okay. This is the case file from the fire. I've been over it a dozen times. And everything in it,everything,points to callister torching stark's lab. But stark insists that it was faulty wiring. So you think that he was protecting callister? I think he still is. Callister. Nathan? Where is he? Is everything okay? I know he's here.Where is he? He's upstairs.I'll go get-- nathan,what's going on? Callister! what did you think you were gonna do? Get out of the house. oh,my-- nathan,what-- get out of the house now. Oh,my god. nathan! Nathan! nathan,wait. Oh,my god. Callister,what did you do? I didn't mean to. Beverly,are you okay? I'm fine. But look at my house. What happened? I don't know.Stark came in,screaming for callister. Next thing I know,the whole place is on fire. Where are they now? They left. I think callister got burned. Okay. Henry. Where's the hydrant and I'll help you hook it up. Carter,this is eureka. Beverly,is everybody out? Yes. Clear! Right. Eureka. As you can see,the nanotech composite has limited-- limitless capabilities for replication. where are they,fargo? If you'll excuse me for a moment,everyone. Can't you see I'm in a meeting? Where are they? I honestly don't know. Let me come at this another way. Do you know where your sarah michelle gellar doll is? Because I do. And if I have to,I will go get it out of your desk. And show it to those nice people. Now,where do you think they are? there's nathan's car. You okay? I don't know.Technically,I'm still married to nathan. But right now,I have no idea who he even is. Well,whatever's going on,if he's lying,I'm sure he has a reason. What could that possibly be? I don't know. But I think we're about to find out. oh,my god. Stark,step aside! Callister,put your hands in the air. Carter,wait. Quiet! Callister,put your hands where I can see them. Carter,listen to me. Nathan-- allison,I can explain. Carter,don't hurt him don't want to. Callister,I don't want to shoot you. Show me your hands. I can'T. Yes,you can. Do as he says. Okay. Not where I thought this was going. I didn't bring him here. I built him here. Callister's A.I. So he's a robot. An artificially intelligent being. Then why keep him a secret? I mean,this has to be one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the modern age. So was the atomic bomb. Doesn't mean the world is ready for it. Truth is I needed to see if callister could assimilate. So I introduced him to eureka as my assistant. And they embraced him. Callister formed attachments,developed relationships. And you did too? I wasn't about to let D.A.R.P.A. Turn him into another military project. How is this possible? I don't know. I had dozens of prototypes. None of them worked. Except for callister. I still don't know why. It's a miracle. So he didn't burn down your lab. You did. I needed them to believe that the entire project had been destroyed. But then sheriff cobb started asking a bunch of questions. So I had to send him away. But how is he connected to the virus? Callister transmits on a wireless network. I thought if I changed his primary microprocessor,I could fix it. But his system's totally corrupted. Nathan,I'm sorry.But you know he can't stay here. That fire could've killed someone. I know. But I can't send him away. Not again. I don't think you'll have to. Callister. Hey. Hey,zoe. Uh,where you headed? Anywhere but here. Perfect. Can I get a ride? Well,come on.Let's get out of here. Yeah. Yeah,okay. stolen,black,late model beemer 7 series. License stark 1. Yeah,I'll hold. You okay? It's just my luck,right? All the good ones are either gay,married,or robots. get anything? No,and we looked everywhere. How about you two? yeah,I'm here. How long ago? Great. Okay,if you find them,stop them and call me immediately. Thanks. Wait. Them? They found the car at a gas station off interstate 17. The attendant said that there was a redheaded girl in the passenger seat. It's zoe. Callister. It's okay. Let's just go. They wouldn't just ditch the car unless they had some other way of getting around. They must be on some form of public transportation. I've checked every airport,bus terminal,taxi service,and ferry within 50 miles. There's nothing on callister raynes or zoe carter. Try another name. Try adjeet-- adjeet ghandavari. Two tickets on an international stage line bus leaving out of summerville. It departs in less than an hour. Okay,you two stay here. Stark,you're with me. call if you hear anything. Callister. Are you okay? Are you okay? I didn't want to leave like this. listen,carter... I'm truly sorry zoe got wrapped up in this. We're gonna find them. Whatever you decide to do-- report me,arrest me,I completely understand. As far as I'm concerned,the case is closed. Project was lost in the fire. Must think it's kind of crazy. First guy running for a machine. Callister just became so much more than that. I don't expect you to understand. I'm a father. Of course I understand. Hey,um...bus 72 to portland? It pulled out a few minutes ago. I told them to hold it.Where's the next stop? Salem,downtown terminal. What's this all about? dad! Zoe. You okay? I think he's sick callister? callister? Hey,nathan. Let's get him back to the car. Give us a second,will you? You didn't leave. I knew he needed help. Where were you going? Anywhere but here. You were right before. If you'd called and asked to come to eureka,I would've said no. And I would've regretted it for the rest of my life. You said you were done with me. Zoe,you're my daughter. And I will never,ever be done with you. I messed everything up again,didn't I? No. It's my fault. I should've never sent you away in the first place. I'm scared. I'm not ready. I know. What's gonna happen to me? Remember what alan touring said? He figured god could give a computer a soul if he wanted to. Do you think that's true? I know it is. What are you doing here? I was just on my way to school. So... I spoke to the credit card company. And pulled some strings with my old boss. You know you're going to have to pay back every penny,right? I know. I will. Okay. Okay. Zoe... I was wrong about your hair. I like it. Really?
