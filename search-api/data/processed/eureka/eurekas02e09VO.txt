for what happened to Kim. Don't. It wasn't your fault. Wish I could be certain of that. I am. You were a good friend, Jack. I just feel bad 'cause I keep things from you. - What are you talking about? - That Beverly stuff. What she did to Kim. What did she do to Kim? So you think you can put this tragedy behind you. Never. But I can be motivated by it. No more than 18 inches from the curb. - Dad! - Parallel to the sidewalk. I have my license. We've done this a million times. And we're gonna do it a million times more before you could go anywhere without me. All right, turn it off. Didn't know it was a down side to winning a car. Yeah, that's me. Your down side. Pop the trunk. Hey, I was... I was gonna come and see you today, - say Hi. - Make sure I wasn't stupid. - Makes me sleep better. - I'm fine, thanks. You... You said something the other day when you weren't yourself. Something about Kim. And... What Beverly did to her. - You thought I should check it out. - Did I say that? If what you said was true, if Kim's death wasn't an accident... If someone's responsible, - I promise you-- - I wasn't myself. But... But... thanks for checking up. There's no curbside service, you know? - Hey Callie. - Hey Jack. You want those cleaned? Come on, we'll get you sorted out. Just a regular clean and a-- Light starch, I know. You know, you'd be surprised how much you can find out about a person from their dry cleaning. You are a strong crisp appearance with a soft flexible feel. - I think it's a compliment. - In a town full of max starch and creases? Trust me. It's a pleasure to do you. I mean... clean you. Your uniform. Yeah, right. Give me your arm. Somebody had a breakfast burrito. - Yeah with ... - With ketchup. - There you go. - Ancient chinese secret? I'll never tell. So are you doing anything special to celebrate? Celebrate... - Cleaning my pants? - It's your anniversary. One year in Eureka, says so right here in your file. Are you...? Thanks for remembering. That's sweet. You know, I figure everyone around here is so focused on the future, some of us need to live in the present, right? Yeah. You're right. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. - You know what today is? - Self-adjusting volume. Oh, right. Guess what today is. Make your kid your chauffeur day. Oh, you know the deal. You gotta get above a B plus in everything,s before you get to fly solo. And what was your high school's GPA? Well... You know, I... had issues. Hey, Joe. What's up? Yeah, yeah. I'll be right there. All right. Drop me off at the pharmacy. Yes, Miss Daisy. Oh, all right. All right, I'll walk. It's just a block. You go straight to school. - Wait, by myself? - Yeah. I had a... A 2.8. I'll cut you some slack for the genetic handicap. But, look at me. You go with no stops, no music, - no friends, no cell phone, you got it? - No problem. - Okay, look, I'm checking my mirrors. - Good. Has this pharmacy never broke-in before? No. And I have been here 15 years. I know. Most people don't even lock their doors. No, I mean this. Oh, that was developed years ago. Still too expensive for mass production. Eureka has its perks. You know, if one day you could just get me up to speed, that'd be great. So... what was taken? - Polyethylene glycol. - Let me guess. Permanent sun block. Instant cavity filler. We keep those up front. Where was the glycole stored? Outside here, with the rest of the shipment. That camera work? - 24 hours a day. - Okay, we're gonna take a look at the footage from last night. Anything else missing? Cash, drugs... Cure for cancer? Not a darn thing. My damsel in shining armor. Can I get a lift? Sorry, Jasper. I promised my dad. Come on. It's two miles to school. I'm a knight in distress here. - So you're saying it makes nothing? - No, I'm saying it makes everything. Polyethylene glycol is a base. It's in shampoo, it's in motor oil, it was probably in the syrup that you put on your pancakes this morning. Oh, no, no, no. I'm doing the no carbs thing. - Which I think is working. - Okay, Carter. I have a real emergency in section four. - Emergencies... Are my specialty. - Great. Are you a lunar geologist? Yeah. - Something wrong with the moon? - Just the pieces of it that we have here. You have moon rocks here? That's... I saw a bunch when I was a kid. My dad drove me to Menlo Park just to see-- - Fake ones. - That's classified information. What? He's a big enough boy now. He should know the truth. Come on. I had my nose pressed up against a glass like other kids, - you tell me those things are just... - Gravel. You really think we'd let something alien on the public? Yes. Oh, stop it. There's no such thing as... Kryptonite. Told you he was a big enough boy. These are the original moon rocks. But they didn't always look like this. Two days ago their molecular structure began to change.</i> Radioactive crystals started to form. Forty years of nothing. Now this. - <i>Tell him the scary part.</i> - <i>That's not the scary part?</i> We have two tons of them. So if you'll stop pressing your nose up against the power glass, we might be able to figure out whether or not they're alive. That's awesome. Satellite radio Eureka style. You got like a thousand channels. My dad told me it's a distraction. Okay. A big truck: distraction. You dad: definitely a distraction. Me? Totally harmless. - You're okay? - What the hell was that? There's nothing here. Like my dad's gonna believe that. The Projet-SG Team presents: Timing: Golgi, Linwelin, Moochie, Ricana. Transcript: swsub.com Edition: Golgi, Linwelin, Moochie, Ricana. Proofreading: Golgi, Linwelin. - Season 2 | Episode 9 - Sight Unseen (v. 1.0) I was paying attention. Yeah, tell that to your front axel. You did a number on this. It felt like I hit something. You did hit something. How many times have I told you? Keep your eyes on the road at all times. You keep... If you don't believe me, then just ask Jasper. - There was someone with you? - That's not why-- I told you. No friends, no distractions. That is why you didn't see what you hit. School only. Until I say otherwise. And it just got bumped up to a 4.0. Heard you had an accident. What did you hit? Nothing. Will everyone just stop interrogating me on this, please? Okay. We've got a call. All right. Get in the jeep. We'll give you a ride to school. And the car stays here. Let's hope this is more exciting than someone stealing shampoo. That is a barking dog, yes. - But what's it barking at? - Who knows? All the day and night, it just wonders by our house over there and starts making noise. Reminds me of my husband. Ex-husband. - So the dog's not yours? - I'm a cat person. Yeah. Hey, Jo, check this out. It's empty. From the pharmacy. Look at this. What's going on? Something extremely dangerous. It's important to realize how the slightest change in balance, even on an atomic level, can create chaos. A simple error in chemical formula calculation can cause disastrous volatility. Would someone please hand Miss Carter the paper towels? Thank you. Now. On to our next unit. Robotics. Our class will participate in the annual ro-boxcar grand prix. The most thrilling event of the trimester. So pair off into two-person teams. You'll have 24 hours to design and build a vehicle that can achieve a sustained speed of 85 miles per hour, and withstand .90 GS on the skid pad. Extra credit for style. Clearly Jasper thinks you're hot. But not smart enough to be his partner. In my opinion he's an idiot. No one usually asks my opinion. Does everyone have a partner? Well, it looks like we're stuck together. Welcome to my world. It's quiet, but it has its advantages. - Like what? - Kidding. No advantages. I know. I'm Lucas. We have three classes together. Really? Story of my life. I'm sure you realize that if you're right, and we can figure out why these rocks have altered their molecular structure, that you'll be in line for a second Nobel Prize. Measuring. Your wall or the isotope ratio? First things first. Should give us some indication. Decontamination sequence complete. Did you... - Did you talk to Jack today? - Couldn't avoid it. But I got to crush a childhood memory. So it wasn't all bad. Did he mention anything about Kim or... the accident? No. Why would he? I think I said something while we were all affected by the GABA blockage. What kind of thing? That Kim's death wasn't an accident. Knowing Carter, he won't leave well enough alone. And hadn't you said you had proof that someone sabotaged the experiment that killed Kim? No. I said that I'd found something that proved you weren't responsible. You need to give it to me. - No, I don't. - Henry, Carter's on to you. If he gets a hold of it, turns it over to the government. You and I will no longer have access to the artifact data or Kim's lab ever again. I need to find out what really happened to Kim. We both have things we're trying to protect. Believe me. You don't have a choice. Pharmacist confirms the container was stolen from his store, but not the syringe, or that bag. Those items are pretty harmless on their own, but who knows... What you can do if you mix them together. I'll... run those things over to GD just as soon as I kill Zoe. Her car's gone. - The dry cleaner. - Callie! - Hey! You okay? - Yeah. I-I think so, but something's wrong. Yeah, come on. Keep on. I'll give you guys... more information when I have it. That was a hell of a blast. You're okay? What? What happened? I don't know. I was just mixing my formula as usual. Yeah... Is this stuff toxic? No, I don't keep anything locked. Not locked. Toxic. Hey, we're all clear in here. - It's nothing lethal. Just a big mess. - Okay. God bless you too, Ed. Try rubbing them. In love with him? No. I... I'm totally single right now. Is that better? A little. Yeah. And you didn't ask about my love life, did you? No. It's okay. Come on. Show me what happened. Oh, my God. It's not exactly... fluff and fold. I have an off-site lab permit. My cleaning formula is kind of involved. Yeah, I gathered. What happened? I don't know. I must've measured my mixture wrong. Has... Has anyone been in here? Is there something missing? No, I don't think so. It's just me, why? Somebody stole a chemical from the pharmacy. They might have stolen something here. A change of the formula caused the explosion. Well, my ratios are pretty specific. If I could get a... a sample... of what you mixed this morning I could give it to Henry, and he could take a look. One sample coming up. That's... great. Nice. Thank you. You probably saved my life today, Jack. Pure self-interest. I spill a lot. Maybe I can help you out with that. Let me take you out for dinner tonight. Please, it's the least I can do. Yeah, dinner... Yeah, I mean the idea is great... - But-- - Did you just say Café Diem at eight? Perfect. Sure. Yeah. It's a date. A date? Sorry. Yeah, no. I... It's not... - We could... - I hope the bad guys can't fool you that easily. Yeah. Still think those are ET's moon rocks, huh? Never rule anything out. You sure you got time to do this? I've already figured out what happened to change these rocks. They're missing an element called Aluminum 26, it'll probably take the rest of my life to figure out how that happened. So I might as well support my local Sheriff in the meantime. This is... Callie's formula and a sample of what she mixed today. And this is the stuff that I found in the woods. So... What did you say was missing from the moon rocks? Aluminum 26. A highly unstable radioactive element. Well, somebody's been stealing chemicals. What if they stole that too? All things being possible, these rocks are under 24-hour surveillance, under lock and key, so once again, the question becomes "how?" besides, extracting Al-26 from moon rocks would require a sophisticated process, you'd have to be trained... You mean like... like everyone in town. - Gotcha. I'll check it out. - Thanks. One more thing. I don't suppose by any chance you've towed Zoe's car to your garage today? - No. - Yeah, that's what I was afraid of. - <i>What's going on?</i> - I'm sealing off this chamber. Just got started. Well, we have a bigger problem now. Traces of radioactive material have been found throughout the building. It could come from anywhere. With aluminum 26 isotopes? Probably happened during transport. Well, that's what I thought until we realized that it's on the move. - What? - <i>Every time we try to contain</i> the radioactivity, it escapes, it moves, it hides. Allison, we are sitting on two tons of these rocks. If there is a lifeform there, we need to study it. I would rather err on the side of caution. Implying I wouldn't. Last time something like this escaped from a lab at GD it ended up in my son. So the chassis needs to withstand at least a G if we want to get an A. Who cares about the A? It's about the experience. What? I thought you were all about the grades. Why? Because that fits the stereotype nerd/geek/loser mold that hot girls like you put me into? No, because I'm all about the grades, and I wanted an A, and I was hoping that my partner might too. If you say so. And I'm not hot. - You're just fishing for compliments. - Okay, can we just... Stick to the work, please? Sorry. I didn't mean to distract you with all the... verbal sparring and the... sudden sexual tension between us. Please, you're so not my type. That's what they all say. Until they fall madly in love with you? No. That's what they all actually say. You find anything on those tapes? Nope. I found nothing. - Great, Jo. That's helpful. - No, no, no. I found nothing. Take a look. At what? Okay, watch closely. Those boxes? There, see? What was that? You mean who is that. I think we may be looking for an invisible thief. Cafe Diem? I've been looking all over for you. - It's school related. Not sexual. - Yeah, where's your car? - Where I parked it. - Great, okay. Give me the keys. Oh, come on Dad. He's so not worth breaking grounded for. No, this isn't about him. This is about what you hit. I think I know why you didn't see it. My car, it's... Invisible. You just hate it when I'm right, don't you? Especially when I can't fix it. Invisibility was abandoned before anybody could really figure it out. Somebody figured it out. Make way, national security. Just looking at this could be a federal offense. Ms. Blake needs this car towed to GD immediately. Can't you just spray it with some special... GD potion and make it come back? Invisibility is illegal, Jack. So whoever's been working on this, is doing it in secret. You can't reverse what you don't understand. Oh, come on. No... spectrum super charger, or like night vision goggles, or... like an infrared mega-thingy? No. Actually... There is an infrared mega-thingy. I realized the infrared spatial technology developed for non x-ray tumor detection might work on anything with an invisible mass. Can you see it? Yeah, perfectly. We're all gonna need one. - Prototype. Only one exists. - We have to figure out who did this, before someone discovers that we broke the treaty. Hold on. I'm the law on this town. How can something be illegal if I don't even know it exists. GD was working on invisibility in the late 90s. At that point the concept was only theoretical. But Aluminum 26 was the key ingredient in the formula. After 9/11, it was shut down. Along with miniaturization and teleportation. - So how do you explain this? - Your theory was correct. Your thefts and our thefts are related. Someone's ignoring the ban and using Al-26 extracted from the moon rocks. So we really are looking for the invisible man? Or woman. In that bag that you found was a chemical called PCE. Callie Curie uses PCE in her dry cleaning formula. All right. Maybe it was stolen from her. Or maybe she's been using her business as a cover for further experiments for the past seven years. She was part of the original invisibility team. Vincent just came by. Brought me a cappuccino. So I asked him to make us baked alaska tonight in honor of the explosion. You don't like baked alaska? What've you been doing in here, Callie? Getting out those stubborn stains. Is there any chance that... Invisibility was the key to your success? What are you talking about? I know that was the focus of your research before you started... Doing this. Yeah. It was. And it wasn't healthy. It was all I had time for. That's why I started doing this. I wanted... a real life, normal hours... Maybe... A boyfriend. When the... When the treaty shut down your project did you start this business so you could continue your work? I was relieved when they shut us down. It gave me an excuse to get out. Look, I may have adapted some of my research, but it's all perfectly safe... And legal. So that was just a coincidence? That the day your lab explodes, my daughter's car turns invisible right down the street? Well, okay, first of all, are you saying that someone's actually done this? Because... without a large amount of Aluminum 26, that's not possible. Stolen from the unstable compounds lab at GD where you worked for eight years. I thought that you were a better judge of character. Sometimes I don't like my job. My GD clearance was revoked when the treaty was signed, and I haven't set foot in that building since. You don't believe me... Check the security records. I'm gonna need the names of everybody you worked with on that team, gotta check them out. Fine. Sometimes I don't like your job either. We have radiation trace readings everywhere. 18 locations, no discernable pattern. Looks like they're using the air ducts to travel. Great. Just what we need: airborne-intelligent radioactive life. From space? Can we put a bell on him or something? Every time we have a part of it cornered, it moves, like it knows we're chasing it. Right now, the levels aren't harmful. But if they get any higher, I'm going to have to evacuate the building, maybe even the town. Carter, please tell me you've figured out this invisibility problem. Tell me about Frank Phillips. He's a surveillance specialist. Why do you need to know? I'm confronting Callie's list. What was he before? DOD had me put him on the invisibility team for a short while. Where is he? He's a CIA surveillance specialist. A spook's spook. An enigma. He's so private he won't even look in a mirror. - You can't tell him I let you in. - Fargo, it's an official investigation. - But if he finds out... - He's the only member of the invisibility team who still works here. And the person who stole Aluminum 26 had that GD access. They say he killed a man in Borneo just to watch him die. I think you've seen too many spy movies. Just unlock the door. What if he's in there? No one's seen him in two weeks. Exactly. What if he's in there, invisible, with a poison blow gun from Borneo, waiting? Just... Then he'll get you first. Guy's been here for 15 years. You think he'd put a picture up. He might still be here. - You start with his computer. - Me? He's already gonna kill you for opening the door. Why risk anyone else? What's supposed to be in here? Lincoln would know. The poop guy. The poop guy. Some offices have a plant guy. I'm the poop guy. Not glamorous, but it's work. I found an empty cage in Frank Phillip's office. My favorite kind. - You got any idea what was in there? - Mice. 18 of them. Cute, white ones. Not the rats they feed all that artificial sweetener to see how long it'll take them to explode. Did you say 18? That's all of them. I never would've spotted them without this headgear. - Mind if I keep it? - Yes. You're welcome. Well, little, white mice. Not little, green men. Alien problem solved. No extra charge. These little guys are the 18 hotspots running around the building. Radiation poisoning will kill them within 24 hours. - How'd they get exposed to radiation? - I don't know. Al-26. Works as a viral pathogen. But only subcutaneous exposure is dangerous. Frank Phillips must've used the mice as test subjects. But why would he make them invisible if he knew it would kill them? Maybe you don't use Al-26 to make something invisible, you use it to make something come back. He figured out the formula for invisibility, but not the reversal. Well, he must be desperate to use Al-26. He's got experience to extract it, but there's no way he'll find an answer alone. And... what's the effect on humans? Only subjects with direct exposure, say, through an injection are at risk. Or a cut on the hand. So, what can we do? The invisibility formula attacks organic cells, mice, Carter, Carter's clothes. Callie's dry cleaning formula contains tiny microbes that continue washing in between cleanings. Leave it to Eureka. And what about the car? Encased in an organic polymer wrap, a kind of "super skin" developed in the genetics lab to help burn victims. And apparently it's really good on minor dings. Henry thinks Carter got exposed when he cut his hand on the windshield. It's spreading through his entire body. - Radioactive viral pathogen. - From hell. - Did you check on Zoe? - She's fine. Joe's with her while you're here. Okay. I don't want her to know. Okay. Not until we fix this. Al-26 radiation. It's highly toxic to your system. And if we can't reverse the process in 24 hours, we won't be able to risk this... at all. So I'll be invisible forever? I'll be dead and invisible forever. We'll never make it. We have 15 hours left. That's the point. Anyone could figure this out if they had all the time in the world. How can you be so cool about this? I'm not cool as you've repeatedly pointed out. I just know who I am and what I'm capable of. I know I'll be a lot happier when Joe gets back from the hardware store with those cooling rods. I think you're missing the point. The point? The point is if I don't get straight as, I don't get to drive. I'm talking about the big picture. You get distracted by all the crap. You can't see what's right in front of you. Like what? Like me. Think of everything you've missed because you made a snap judgment and decided that... I wasn't your type. Please. All I've missed is you telling me how shallow I am. And this. You're not shallow. You just haven't explored your depth. No, no, no. No exploring on my watch. We clear? So how long has this been going on? Started a few hours ago. Thought you'd help. - What's the rate of progression? - Faster than we would like. He'll be completely invisible within an hour. Hi, Callie. Oh, my god. If you didn't wanna go out to dinner, you could've just said so. If you could work with Nathan Stark and Henry Deacon and help them figure out how to reverse it. And if you could tell us everything you can remember about Frank Phillips. We called him "Frank the Spook", very intense. Not the warm, fuzzy type. We know that he was CIA. But what did he have to do with the original invisibility team? The DOD had us working with the CIA on finding a way to make their operatives truly stealth. Invisible spies? We were years away from human testing. But, yeah, that was the goal. I think Frank the Spook may have carried the ball over the goal line by himself. He had the rudimentary scientific background but it's unlikely he could've succeeded on his own. We need to find him and find out what he did. Or else, Carter... Is there anywhere he used to talk about? Someplace he used to go? You know, I ran into him once near Strawberry Knoll. And I remember that he had lots of supplies but no camping gear. The dog that was barking at nothing was over by Strawberry Knoll. He's gonna kill me. I'm gonna die. - Wrong direction. - Stop sneaking up on me like that. I'm invisible, Fargo. - I thought you were Frank. - Come on. The dog was barking where we found the chemicals. I think Frank's hideout - has to be somewhere. - Look out... For the invisible shed. Gimme those. Okay. This shed's made of metal. Maybe it's covered in the same stuff that was on Zoe's car. Is that even possible? Asks the invisible Sheriff. What if he's in there? There's no one here. Good. Let's go. - This place is creepy. - You can see all this? Of course. Remember. The skin makes the outside of the shed invisible, not the inside. At least we've his research. Here. Put these on. - Let's go. - Where? Dogs don't bark at nothing. This is where Zoe had her accident. Wait, wait, wait. There's something right there. What is it? It's Frank, isn't it? Unfortunately. He's dead? Pretty much. Zoe hit him. Somehow I don't think it was a car that killed him. This is really bad, Carter's completely gone.</i> We have to help him. Henry's finishing the autopsy on Frank Phillips. His radiation level was beyond lethal. He was definitely a corpse before Zoe hit him. He must've just dropped dead the side of the road. What about the formula Carter found in the shed? Can we reverse it? Callie's working on it. But unless we find something in a few hours... The radiation exposure will be just as lethal as Frank's. I hate this. All this technology and we can't heal what really matters. You know what? Let's find Fargo. Let's get the specs on Zoe's Smart car. And tell him we need 14 square feet of his skin. Beginning incision. This is what's invisible. It's the car's organic wrap. It's a human skin base, but it absorbs damage and heals much faster than the human body. Rather brilliant innovation, if I may say so myself. Well, let's just hope it heals fast enough to shed the radioactive byproducts once we reverse the invisibility formula. Do you think the data Carter found in the shed is accurate? You know I was there too, right? Frank was close to figuring it out, he just got the ratios wrong. If he'd just told someone about this, he might have made it through. People get used to working alone. Makes it hard to trust. So if we're right, the skin should absorb the reversal formula? And with any luck, the radioactivity of Al-26. Let's do this. Now you see it. Zoe's car's back. Completely normal after we applied the invisibility reversal formula to its organic skin. Yeah, guys, that's just great. But... How about me? Oh, god. My hands are shaking. Dr. Stark can do it if you'd like. No, thank you. I'm the one who started working on invisibility. I should be the one to finish it. Guys? It's not working. - We could try another piece. - Wait. Radiation level's dropping. 3%... - 5%. - Watch. I'll be alive but I'll still be invisible. 20%. You're gonna be fine. You did it. We all did it. Could someone just finish doing it? Long night for everyone, I see. Hey, Dad. Did you hear anything about my car? Well, we can see it again. I was afraid it was gone for good. You don't know the half of it. Do I even wanna know why he's in there? No, not if you want a good night's sleep between now and her wedding. - What happened to Casper? - Jasper. Rise and shine, lover boy. I don't know. I guess I just... Saw right through him. The ro-boxcar looks great. I'm guessing it's gonna be the only thing I'm driving for a while, huh? Well... You did break the rules. But I should've believed you that the accident wasn't your fault. So... So I can take my car out again? Oh, no, no. But you can still be my chauffeur. I supposed we have to get this to school, huh? No, there's no hurry. We finished early. Impressive. Yeah. It's nice when you find someone you... click with. Yeah. Beverly, Beverly, Beverly. She planted this near Kim's computer the day of the accident. It's a recalibration device. It created false readouts as Kim began the extraction from the artifact. Which means someone was willing to kill to keep us away from the artifact. I'm gonna trust you with this. - Check. - Told you you'd be good at this. Hope you don't mind a shallow hot girl wiping the floor with you. I've been waiting my whole life. Check. - Sorry I'm late. - Everything okay? Yeah. Just had to take care of something at work. Nothing to worry about. I'll be right with you. Nemo's birthday? It's for the Sheriff. His one-year anniversary in Eureka. He has a thing for shrimp. - How appropriate. - I can't believe it's been a year. Yeah. Seems like 11. I didn't even remember. Well, you may have been thinking about something else. Or maybe I was thinking about someone else. Thanks, Vince. - You are very welcome. Bon appetit. - Thank you. - What is... - Happy anniversary, Jack. Thanks, Callie. This is really nice. I don't know about you, but I can't remember the last time that I had a good date. It's really nice to find someone you... well, click with. Crap! Okay, I am beginning to think
