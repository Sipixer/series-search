program at Harvard. I still can't believe our little girl is leaving home. Kevin, honey? Where are you? Relax, mom. I'm right here. He's different. He doesn't have autism. You're looking at the head of G.D. security. I'm running G.D.? - Yes, I will marry you. - Me marry you? In what universe? So Zane un-proposed? In this reality, nothing's ever even happened. He's that snarky jerk I first met. How's deputy Andy? Fargo says he needs to be re-skinned and reprogrammed. [Air tank pumping, beeping] [Radio chatter] Space week in Eureka. So glad I'm leaving. You and Grace. I mean, she went to a conference on neurobotic prosthetics. Oh, that sounds like a party. You tagging along? She asked but there's the problem of the hotel room. Yeah, married life gets complicated like that. Sheriff, I made Zoe's favorites. There's cupcakes, lemon squares, cannoli. Ha, freshman 15 in a box. Tell her I said hi. And the piece de resistance, aged cheddar maize kernels. Oh, and one more thing! Give her this for me. [Gasping for air] I think he's turning blue, Vincent. - You have a great trip. - Thanks. I think I cracked a rib. I'm not gonna do that there. You excited to see Zoe? Yeah. Yeah, a little nervous. I'm sorry I'm gonna miss your big launch today, Kev. You may not be missing anything. Stop it. Your design is brilliant. Did you weld the pre-igniter in the tail service mast? No, mom, I decided to use duct tape and bubble gum. Really? I'll be at the launch site. Well, a rocket race to the Moon and back. There's no pressure on the kid. I know. Astronautics is the one subject he gets excited about, but his test burns have been a little iffy. I wish I could do more to help him. It's tough being a parent. Yeah, especially when you're suddenly presented with a completely different child. Oh, that's what you're afraid of with Zoe. Never crossed my mind. I mean, you've spoken to her since we've been back. She seemed like herself? Seemed, yeah. I mean, when I surprise her at school, then...Then I'll know if it's her. Give her my love, okay? Thanks. - Sheriff Carter. - Yes. Glad I caught you. Can you give this to Zoe for me? Sure, Pilar, what is it? It is my very own line of totally tech cosmetics and fashion enhancements. Great. Oh, she is going to love this. I call it "match mist by Pilar". What's it do? It is the latest in metamaterial cloaking. Okay, say... You want your shirt to match this napkin. Why would I want my shirt to match a napkin? Thank you, Pilar. Was that really necessary? Tell Zoe to save some of those Ivy league hunks for me. Not that she's partaking. Okay. So glad I'm leaving town. [Dramatic music] Welcome, everyone, to Eureka Rocket Daze 2010, our annual 24-hour race to the Moon and back. Don't forget to buy your official "get Moon" t-shirt. Everything's set for the launch, General. Have you re-tuned the E.M. field? Per your orders, sir, our rocket plumes will be undetectable. Good. I don't wanna spook the North Koreans. Last year they mistook your little soapbox derby as a missile attack. No chance for that, sir. Lupo's on top of it. Right this way. General Mansfield, can I tempt you a Saturn spritzer? Titan-tini? Cocktails, Dr. Fargo? Just for the spectators. After the recent unrest at GD., I thought everyone needed to decompress a little. So name your poison, partner. No thank you. General, I'm sure that you're here to see the spectacular space advances that Global Dynamics is making. Yes, that's why I'm here. And you are? Dr. Charles Gant. Dr. Grant is a scientific historian. I did C.C. You on the personnel memo. And today really is history in the making. Dr. Ramsey. Yo. Check it. My design for the mars colonization habitat module. Looks like a resort. Everyone needs a way to relax, man. Where's the dome? How do you breathe? Ah, yes, air, very important, especially on Mars. Dr. Ramsey's come up with a remarkable solution to that problem. Peep it. This is TAP... Terraforming Atmospheric Processing fluid. It's a radiation-activated compound that creates oxygen. Technically catalyzes the photodissociation of oxygen from rocks and soil to produce a breathable environment. Word up! Boo-yah. Hey, you want to go for a spin? Zane, cut the engine. Explain. I clearly told you no joy rides. You're only allowed to operate the sky cruiser from G.D. to here and back. Yes, sir. Wouldn't want to disobey you or the enforcer. Why are you allowing Donovan to operate a 150 million dollar prototype? Mr. Donovan's the only person who can actually fly it. And I did design the thing. You are a felon, here on qualified parole, with a history of strikingly poor judgment. He takes this responsibility very seriously. Don't you? [phone beeps] Oh, abso-frickin-lutely. Larry's ready at mission control. Perfect! Right on schedule. General, Jo will show you to the VIP seating area. Fine. Sir, please, right this way. Report range, go for launch. Range, go for launch. Range, you're good for launch. Roger. T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. And we have liftoff. [Cheers and applause] Dr. Fargo, I had my reservations, but that was a very impressive launch. Glad you enjoyed it, General. As you can see, we have everything under control. - Birds. - What? Birds. Oh, crap. Zane! Zane. Zane, Zane. Whoa! Did you see that? It was awesome. [Chuckles] Sync by fant0m, corrected by gloriabg Do you realize what you've done? You destroyed the prototype. Prototype, as in only one. It musta malfunctioned. Malfunctioned. You're inebriated. I am not... Those are pretty ribbons. Zane, knock it off. - What happened? - I'll tell you what happened. He's been indulging in those Titan-tinis that you've allowed on the premises. Hey, I am not drunk. I was flying back to G.D. like little Fargo over there with the...The glasses told me, and there was these birds, and then I went... And came... Came down. I don't know. Donovan. You are going back where you belong, to federal prison. No, I need to complete a formal investigation. Of what? He was hot-rodding under the influence, and he just obliterated a multimillion dollar project. But he said he wasn't drinking, right, Zane? Zane! Sorry, I spaced out there. What? Lupo, I'm surprised at you. How are you gonna handle this? Fargo, everyone, even Zane, is entitled to due process. Detain him while you figure out what happened here. [Imitates laser blast] [Rock music] Oh, sorry. Hi. Hey. Uh, hi. Sorry, I'm looking for Zoe Carter's room. Dad? Surprise. Oh, my God, hi. Hey. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, everything's great. Changed your hair. - Yeah, you like? - Yeah. I mean, I can get used to it. [Chuckles] Oh. So what are you doing here? I was gonna ask him the same question. Oh, this is my partner, lab partner, Jake. Oh. Hey, Mr. Carter. Hi. Sheriff Carter, actually, as in "armed." Okay. [laughs] We were just experimenting. - Studying! - Right. Mabel here for our class in behavioral psych. Oh. Hey, pretty kitty. Oh... [cat hisses] The topic is aggression. [Cat whines] It's going well. [Chuckles] Well, let you two catch up. I'll, see you at the Baker house tonight? Uh... Oh, no, no, if you have plans, by all means, no, go on. No, it's fine. There'll be other parties when I'm not at the library studying. Just tell everyone hi for me. Yeah, sure. Well, nice to meet you. Yeah, nice to meet you too. [Door closes] So before I forget, here's the care package from Vincent. [Gasps] Cupcakes, oh! And maize kernels. Yep. And... Spray paint? Match mist by Pilar. Oh, right, metamaterial cloaking. Cool. Yeah. You hungry? I'm starving. Great, lead me to the best burger joint in Cambridge. Okay. [Spraying sound, cat whines] And we have ourselves a race! Okay, people, get your wallets out. No stingy mindys. Come on, the game is afoot. Cash only. Okay, I've got you. Excuse me. Oh, my. And Kevin Blake has just moved into first. [Cheering] Breathalyzer test was clean. There's no alcohol in his system. Ow! Why'd you do that? Well, just hold still. I have a race to get to. You're pretty. Okay, he's obviously on something. Okay, Zane's anti-anything that can mess with his brain. This Zane? Yo, Lupo, check the engines. One of those crazy-assed birds musta gotten sucked in. Jo, I know that dealing with him in this reality has been tough on you, but you might be letting your feelings for the Zane you knew affect your judgment. This room is spinny! I knew a part of him that was good and honest. I have to believe that it's still there. Please, can you just run the tests again? See if you find anything. Okay. Well, the engine is sound. No bird strike. But I'll keep looking. If it's not this, it'll be some other fiasco with Zane. He's trouble. I just want to be sure. Well, that's odd. I mean, that's close to impossible. The fuel tank? That's a gas tank? Yeah, it holds enough for ten hours of continuous flight. - Is it damaged? - No, it's empty. The genius bad boy ran out of gas? That doesn't make any sense, and it also doesn't explain why he was blitzed. Don't want an explanation. I want him gone. Make it happen. [Sighs] Hmm, I'm liking the higher cheek bones. Linoleum. Aluminum. [Cell phone rings] - Deputy Andy. - Andy, it's Jo. I need a favor. At your service, miss Lupo. Can you go up to the launch site and see if you can find any crows. They may be acting drunk. Drunk crows. I'm on it. [Phone beeps] You're certainly Mr. Nostalgia today. Yeah, well, you know, seeing you here at college, it brings back memories that we share. - Okay. - It's sort of a nice thing. - Hey, Zoe. - Hi. That's another lab partner? Dad, they're just friends. Ah, you still friends with Lucas? Lucas? Yeah, he's great. But, you know, he's been swamped at M.I.T. Oh. How's your course load? I mean, are you okay? You still want to be a doctor? Yes. Lots of questions. Sorry. I just want to make sure you're okay. You know, and that your... That your plans for the future are secure. Oh, my God. What... Are you dying? I'm not dying. Well, all the reconnecting and the reminiscing and the childhood memories. No, no, no, no! No, I'm... I'm... Just interested. So Mabel liked the care package. Mabel, what did you do? Where is she? Here, kitty. [Cat growls] [Distant growling] That isn't good. Mmm. Hey. You sound sober. I've been sober. I wasn't drinking. But whatever messed with my head just went away. [Cell phone rings] - Lupo. - Yo, it's Ramsey. Somebody's been messing around in my lab. Could you, like, come and check it? Yeah, as soon as I can. [phone beeps] Gotta go. Andy, did you find anything? Negative on the drunken crows, but I did find a dead one. Bag it and bring it back to G.D. I want it autopsied. I can save you time there. Hold please. Well, that's curious. This corvus brachyrhynchos has recently detached retinas. It went blind before it died. Can you tell why? Inconclusive. Old age maybe. Possibly environmental. Andy, take a really good look around and just see if you can find anything unusual and report back to me. Will do. We may be onto something. There's got to be a reason you and those crows dropped out of the sky. I don't get it. You love busting me. You've busted me tons of times. Why do you give a crap now? Because you don't have to be that guy. And this time they're sending your sorry ass back to prison. Lupo... You're wasting your time. Fine. Then take off. I won't stop you. Or you can stay and fight to clear your name. It's your choice. Rust. I'd say that qualifies as unusual. Hmm, I seem to be conflagrating. Oh, dear. So check it, somebody stole my TAP. That stuff you wanna use up on Mars. That stuff is like gold, man. It takes forever to produce, and someone came in here this morning and helped themselves to 522 milliliters of it. Well, all it does is make air, right? Really? That hurts me, man. It turns into self-propagating oxygen, if it's activated. And then you gotta be careful not to inhale it. Oh, that is one nasty high. You mean people can use it recreationally? Stupid people. Yeah, you can huff it like nitrous if you're not gonna miss the brain cells. Do you think those kids took it? What kids? Those meddling kids. I'm working with a bunch of interns from the Tesla school. No, I think I have an idea who took it. You've reached deputy Andy. Please leave a message after I make this tone. Beep. Andy, Jo. Where are you? Call me. Jo, you were right. I found something. Zane's blood tests indicate hyperoxia. He has an excess of oxygen in his system. Oxygen? Yeah, I don't know how he was exposed. Most likely it's what caused his disorientation. - Right. - Jo, Zane's lucky. Higher levels can lead to cell damage, seizures, retinal detachment. Blindness. I need to do a more thorough examination. No. I mean, it really isn't necessary. He's back to his old self. I gotta go. I have to tell you something. Later. Go get Zane, preferably in shackles. - I can't do that. - Jo, we've been through... Zane isn't here. What do you mean he's not... You've made the arrangements to transfer Donovan? Yes, absolutely, but he's still being debriefed by my team. So why don't you and I grab a mochachino? Good. Okay, it's intermission now, as the rockets move around the dark side of the Moon. So tell me, Kevin, as one scientist to another, what was your inspiration? Actually, it was my skateboard. Well, you see I needed to catch more air off the ramp, so I came up with a hydrogen-peroxide booster. But I'm working on an even better launch for next year's race with this, super-compressed hydrogen balloons. They're gonna launch my rocket even higher into the atmosphere. That's pretty ingenious, pal. Thanks. So you only used hydrogen-peroxide to fuel this rocket? Well, different mixtures for different stages. Here, check it out. Here, Mabel. Here, girl. Pilar, just tell me how this stuff works. Duh, how do you think? It's a plasmonic spray, causing negative refraction. Great, the spray diverts light waves, so we won't see Mabel. We'll just see what she's in front of. Well, that narrows it down. Pilar, how long does it last? I don't know. It's designed to set on fabric. It's not gonna stabilize on a live animal's fur. So in other words, she'll just keep changing. I don't know. Thanks, Pilar, super helpful. Bye. That cat was 80% of my final grade. Ahh! There's something in there. Sorry. Found her. Reacquiring signal. And signal reacquired, and we are back from the dark side with Kevin Blake still leading the way home. I'm number one! [Cheers and applause] Allison, can I have a word with you for a minute? Yeah, sure. I don't know how to tell you this, Allison. It's possible Kevin may have had an unfair advantage. What? What are you saying? I'm saying Kevin's a brilliant kid, but he may have felt pressured into boosting his propellant with something outside the race parameters. Like what? Well, I don't know. But the formula he claims he used wouldn't result in a flare with that color. I'm so sorry, but I thought you should know. Andy, you're a robot. How can you be unavailable? I need you to help me find... Zane. What changed your mind? I don't know. Nobody's ever stuck their neck out for me before. Did you steal Dr. Ramsey's tap fluid? What are you talking about? Well, if you didn't take it, then there's gotta be more to this. I'm going up to the crash site to find Andy and see if I can figure this out. You wanna come with? You'd be aiding an escaped prisoner. [Chuckles] I'll arrest myself later. Why'd you let me go? Maybe I give you too much credit, but I think under the snarky posturing there really is a decent guy. The real me sounds boring. [Chuckles] Well, you're too irritating to be boring. Funny. You're always busting my ass. Every once in a while I get this feeling about you. What kind of feeling? Um... Dizzy. Me... Me too. I wouldn't start 'er. One spark and she could blow. What happened? The area's a tad combustible. You hang tight. I'll have you back at G.D. in a jiff. We're so lucky you found us, Andy. I'm sorry you burst into flames. Fortunately, I managed to extinguish myself. The curious thing is Andy can't burn. I assure you, I ignited, sir. And before my sensors melted, they detected an unusually high level of oxygen. Inhale. [breathes deeply] Not to mention, the steel gantries on the launch site had rusted. That could be the result of rapid oxidation. How does that happen? Well, normally the atmosphere concentration of oxygen is 21%. But if there's too much oxygen, then material that is usually not flammable, like Andy, catches fire very easily. Just takes a spark. Like from my cell phone. So Zane got loopy and crashed because there was too much oxygen at the launch site? Yeah, which would probably also explain why he burnt up so much fuel so quickly. Well, if it was the oxygen, then I'm off the hook. We still don't know why there's such a high concentration. Henry, Dr. Ramsey said that his tap fluid is missing. He said that it could become self-propagating. That's a problem. It could be a big one. Tap fluid is very stable. The electromagnetic wavelength necessary to activate it is precise. But if it has been activated somehow, then everything around Eureka will become as explosive as Andy. Can you see her? Nope, I see tile. [Cat meows, hisses] Ah, it's her! [Groans] Oh, hey. Should you be in here? Dad, these are co-ed bathrooms. [Cat meows] Is Mabel with you? No, she is in my room. You look cold. You should put a shirt on. Okay, will see you later. You seriously like that guy? Enough of the comments. You shouldn't even... What? Be here. You show up, you make a mess of my project, and now I'm stuck in a bathroom when I should be out with my friends. Well, it's just we haven't seen each other in so long. Then call first. I'm not a little girl anymore. I have my own life. Oh. Well, you're right. You... Yeah, you should go to the party. Don't give me a guilt trip now. No, no guilt trip, I promise. You... I'll take care of the cat. No, I... I just tried... [Exhales deeply] Well, that went well. The greatest concentration of oxygen is up here within the highest point of our E.M. field spreading lower and lower, first reaching the launch site, then lower down the mountain until eventually it will hit the town. Then stop it from expanding. Yeah, turn off the E.M. field and air it all out. Whoa, man, what are you smoking? You can't just release it. My tap's designed to work on a planetary scale. It'll just keep leeching oxygen from the environment. Dr. Ramsey, what would possess you to create something so potentially catastrophic? Man, don't blame the tap. Okay, it's harmless on Earth. To be activated, it would have to be irradiated somehow with a very specific wavelength. Until then, harmless! The first place there was trouble was at the launch site. Guys, that tap fluid would make awesome rocket fuel. Oh, boy. When we adjusted the E.M. field, we must have hit just the right... Or wrong frequency to activate the tap. I love it. It's your fault. Zane. The question is: Who used it to boost their rocket? I said I didn't use it. Kevin, it's okay. There's no way you coulda known the E.M. field was retuned. But now this crazy amount of oxygen is building up, and we need to know exactly what you did. What's going on here? They think I used Dr. Ramsey's tap fluid to boost my rocket, but I didn't, mom. I swear, I didn't. I know you didn't, Kevin. How can you be so sure? Because I did. What? Honey, you had put so much effort into your rocket, and your test burns weren't going well. So you cheated? It was just so important to you. So? This is my thing, ma. You been acting like a freak for weeks, on me all the time about everything, and now this? Honey, I just didn't want you to be disappointed. I'd rather lose the race than win it like this. And you should know that about me. Kev... Hey, Vin, take my name out of the race and put my mom's in. Allison, I know you meant well, and you couldn't have known that we re-tuned the E.M. shield. But there's a cloud of self-propagating oxygen spreading toward town and a bunch of rockets on their way home. Those engines are burning until they hit the ground. So if we don't figure out a way to stop them, Eureka's gonna be toast. Code orange. All personnel report to secure sectors three, six... Should I initiate evacuation protocols in town, sir? No, it's safer if people don't move around, but I want a complete power down of any potential ignition sources outside of G.D. That means no cars, no computers, and you! No wool sweaters! Oh, no. What... [Chuckles] It washes out. It... Oh. [Cat meows] Yeah, hear that, Mabel? Someone's gonna get wet. It washes off. You still have to catch her. True. Cheddar cheese maize kernels, irresistible. You look so grown-up. Isn't there a frat party you should be at or... And miss this? Pssh, not a chance. I shoulda called. I shouldn't have yelled. True. That was... Bridge, water. So do you have any idea where my final project is? [Cat grumbles] It sounds hungry. Ah. You want to blow them all up? By activating the rockets' self-destruct mechanism, we eliminate the immediate threat. That still leaves us with too much oxygen. We know the oxygen is the problem, but first things first. Fargo, the self-destruct codes. Space week was going so well. [Typing] [Alarm sounds] You gotta blast them all, Fargo, otherwise it's kind of pointless. Duh! That should have detonated. Are you sure you entered the correct codes? Yes! Whose rocket is that anyway? Speed's all about lightness, people. Those self-destruct mechanisms are heavy. Don't tell me you left it out. Okay, I won't. But I did. Larry. Don't scold me, Dr. Blake. You didn't catch me putting tap fluid in my son's rocket fuel. Hey! We only have six hours until impact. Can we divert it back into orbit? There's not enough delta-v left for a return trajectory. If we can't stop the rocket, then let's focus on reducing the oxygen level. Any suggestions? We're screwed. Awkward. [Cat meows] Here she comes. Don't make eye contact. - If I could see her eyes... - Don't make eye contact. [Cat meows] Hi, Mabel. Good Mabel. Yeah, who's a sweet... Demon kitty. Go. [Cat screeching] You wanted aggression? I think you're gonna get an "A". Yeah? Yeah. Okay. [Meows] Oh, that's not right. [Overlapping chatter] Hey. Hey. Look, we haven't known each other all that long. Maybe we've known each other for 63 years, depends on how you look at it. I just, I don't get it. Why'd you do it? What were you thinking? I wasn't. You don't know what it's like to have an autistic child. - Well... - Not that that is an excuse. But I have spent his entire life trying to connect with him. And then I come back here, and he is so different. He is articulate and independent. And it's like I get to start over, and I just wanted everything to go well, and... Well, I think you have to start by trusting your son. [Cell phone rings] It's Kevin. I guess it's time to take my lumps. Hey, sweetheart. Mom, I know how to fix this, the self-propagating oxygen. We can neutralize the problem. We just have to combine it with hydrogen. I mean, it's simple. Well, yeah, honey, in theory, but that reaction will be very explosive, especially in these conditions. Don't worry. I've got this figured out. Whoa, wait, Kevin, where are you calling me from? Mom, I'm close by, okay? I've got this under control. Kevin! Mom, I told you I've got this covered. No, you get covered. No, I have to detonate the hydrogen gas once the balloons get high enough. The whole town will ignite. No, mom, it's your basic chemical reaction, H2O. It'll put out the flames before they get to us. - It's possible. - Possible? Look, that rocket's gonna be here any minute. If we're gonna give Kevin's experiment a try, now might be a good time. Look, mom, you have to trust me, okay? And if we all burst into flames, you can ground me later. Dr. Fargo. You are telling me that you are trusting the fate of a multibillion dollar facility to a 13-year-old boy? Sir, Kevin Blake is a gifted scientist no matter what his age, and his solution could work. And if it doesn't, you know how quickly you can be replaced. General, I have a contract. I'm the head of G.D. Figurehead is more like it. I placed you here. I can take you down. Since the town may go up in flames, I wanted to thank you for not letting me hang for it. Just doing my job. Anyway, thanks, Jo Jo. What did you call me? Sorry, you hate that? Yeah, you hate that. High enough? High enough. You ready? Do I have a choice? Nope. We're set to go. Go for it. He says go for it. Ready? [Cheering] Grant. Grant, what's happening? Grant, can you hear me? Yeah, baby, two hydrogens and one oxygen. That is what I'm talking about. Grant, can you hear me? Yes, yes. We're all safe. It's raining. Everyone's safe! [Laughter and applause] Yes! I got this race in the bag. You know, it's hardly fair since we blew up the competition. A win's a win. Yeah, well, you're coming in too fast. It's way off target, and it's... And that's a residential area. We got to get emergency crews there now. Fargo, where is that? Fargo, what's the address? 4020 Coriolis Loop. What? What? That's my house. Well, it seems like you've tamed the savage beast. Yeah. Next time she acts up, just show her the shower head. I'm sure that'll do the trick. So Mabel, it's been a pleasure. Not really. [Cat meows] You know, my biggest fear when I was coming here was that I'd get here and you'd have changed. You have. I'm really proud of you. I'm glad you're happy here. I am. But, you know, last night with Mabel, it really made me miss home. Not you, but home. Well... Well, it'll be there, assuming nobody blew up Eureka in my absence. Dad. Is everything really okay? I feel like there's something you're not telling me. Zoe, this is one Eureka situation that I can't tell you about, but you don't have to worry. Okay. But if you ever want to talk, you know where to find me. Yeah. I like your hair. Thank you. Oh, don't tell me Andy arrested you. Welcome back. Evening. Andy's my hero. He's off being repaired and re-skinned. So you just miss the office then? I miss my house. Larry's rocket went boom. No home, no Zane. Everything pretty much sucks. Come on. Get your stuff. With Zoe gone, S.A.R.A.H. could use the company. And, so could I. Suppose I could tolerate you. Oh, don't get excited. It's not permanent.
