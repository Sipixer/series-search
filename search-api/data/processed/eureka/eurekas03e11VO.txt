It's GD's bio-textiles field lab. Everything from self-fitting wedding dresses... - To maternity clothes? - It's a growth industry. So am I. Nothing fits anymore. Two beautiful mommies. - Invisi-parel, huh? - How'd you guess? You can beta test our latest prototype. Not me. Just her. So I'm the guinea pig? Second time around, you get over the feeling fat thing. I still can't believe I'm doing this again. Alone. I'm sorry. You're doing it alone too. But by choice. Duncan is many amazing things, but the settling down type is not one of them. Sorry. I have to go. You have fun. Trust me. You're gonna love it. Allison called. She's got a dispute that she wants you to deal with at GD. Apparently, a couple of scientists aren't seeing eye-to-eye.</i> There's a shocker. Yeah. I'm on my way. Are you okay? Yeah, someone's just about to get the mother of all parking tickets. You gotta be kidding me. Anyone? Crappy driver? Oh. Gee... sorry. You know, with stores selling sodas by the gallon, there really should be more rest stops along the highway. Not really my call, but you can't park your car in the middle of the road. I didn't. That would be absurd. I guess I really had to go. Yeah. I guess so. Well, the universe does things for strange reasons. But my gut tells me explaining that could be kind of a time suck, so... Ma'am... you sure all you had to drink was soda? Are you sure that you're really a cop? Yes. I'm a Sheriff. So please move your car before I have to cite you. Fine, but just for the record, I didn't leave it there. No, it probably magically parked itself. You know, stuff happens. Most people just ignore it. You don't, by any chance, need directions out of town, do you? I don't need anything. Thank you very much. - Have... - Have a nice day. Took you long enough, Carter. There is someone who is driving me crazy. Let me guess... A blonde chick in desperate need of a rest stop. What? No. Him. You're standing in the way of science. In the way of an idiot. Dr. Murray Drechmeyer. He is a brilliant theoretical physicist, but lately, he has veered off track. He seems to believe that he has discovered a paranormal disturbance. He has locked his partner out of the lab and suspended all progress on their project while he protects his discovery. Please just get them back to work. I need their research for something urgent. Dr. Drechmeyer. How's it goin'? Finally! A man with a gun. Don't be afraid to use it! There's plenty of time for that later. This is more important. This? The TIRDs? Look at them! I'll bite. Thermal imaging reactive displacement. I've never seen levels like this. This could be the first documented case of signals from the spirit world. Or the end of our funding.{\ Take your pick.} We can write our own ticket once we prove the other side exists! I am in the middle of a magnetic field test. Which could scare them all away if you don't stop it. Enough! You're gonna have to let her back into the lab. And... You have to look for your ghosts someplace else. Something's happening, Sheriff. If someone on the other side is trying to communicate, how can I just ignore them? Jo, check it out. Pregnant. Not pregnant. Pregnant... Invisi-parel sure can hide the goods. So the baby's father is Duncan, right? Works for the WHO? Saving the world, one malaria-ridden tsetse fly at a time. Does he know you're here? And before you judge, we were only together a couple months. And I'm not sure he's the baby-having type. Now's your chance to find out. May I help you? Extra large diet, easy ice, and you do have a bathroom? Right thru there. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey, hon! I really wish you wouldn't do that! Say hi? Not you. Him. Just in time. For what? Spiritual event, right here. My TIRD meter is going wild! So's mine! He's scaring people. Do something! Murray, why don't you take a seat for a second, okay? Listen, you gotta stop with all these commotions, okay? Okay, did anyone just see that? - What's goin' on? - My meter is spiking. It's starting! - What is this, an earthquake? - It's the TIRDs. They're manifesting. Everybody down! You call this a spiritual event? Look out! Rough town. I was right. They're here. Projet-SG (1.00) Nothing in the kitchen could have caused this? Expensive bottles of spirits to fly off the wall like heat-seeking missiles? Spirits. That's what they were. - Poltergeists. - The movie? Only real. Not real, not helping. You can't deny me now. We had a visitation. Even the Sheriff saw it happen. Tess! Hi, Al. You guys know each other? Sheriff Jack Carter, Tess Fontana. Tess and I are old friends. - Nice to meet you. - Again. - So how old are we talkin'? - Don't go there. We shared an apartment. So what's this, then? A girls' weekend, a baby shower? We really should get going. But you're coming back, all of you? Here? Tonight? Look, these readings are real. Give me one chance to prove it. I know I can make contact... I'll do it tonight. And if you don't? You won't have the Drech-man to kick around anymore. You know, some people attribute occurrences like this to the Casimir effect. Physical forces arising from a quantized field, moving objects through pressure. So that's the answer? The Cashmere effect? It's one possible answer. You have to take into account electricity and relativity, not to mention the fact that objects are primarily influenced by a magnetic field. Meaning ghosts are magnetic? Or someone's using magnets to make it seem like there's ghosts. Right, but... who would wanna do that? You share a lab with Drechmeyer. Theoretically, is it possible to use magnetic energy... I didn't do anything. I wouldn't waste another volt on him. It is a good idea to mess with him. I wish I had thought of that before. So you like him. Not anymore. But you and Murray Drechmeyer were romantically involved. We weren't romantically anything. We were married for 12 years. He was more interested in his ghosts than he was me. Since I left him, well... Things have just gotten out of control. Have they? Or is that a way to discredit him to have your project all to yourself? He is the one who is discrediting me. Sheriff, if I had wanted to humiliate my ex-husband, I would have done so a long time ago. I chose to move on. I suggest you do the same. He's not on your level. Just give him a chance. You'll like him once you know him. I meant your clearance level. Three PHDs, and he thinks that I'm here for a baby shower? Which we'll totally have once I figure out what you do at them. You are officially here as a visiting member of the staff. And how many people know the unofficial reason? Just four besides me. Randolph, Wolfe, Johnson, and Henry Deacon. It's like the Rolling Stones of astrophysics. You think you can handle them? Start me up. You look incredible. You're glowing. Come on, no one really glows. Okay, look, Duncan... When I asked for my stuff, I didn't mean hand delivery. But I had to come and see you... for an explanation. You can't tell me that two people who spend a week making love in a spray at Victoria Falls... Duncan, no, you're right. It was great, but... How well do we really know each other? You know, our hopes, our dreams, our reactions to surprises? Running off isn't exactly a way to find out, now, is it? No, I know. I just... Maybe our timing was just off. There's another guy. Something like that, yeah. I appreciate your honesty. And... I'll respect your wishes. After I meet him. I'm not going to a seance. Then think of it as a scientific investigation. Sorry, my crystal ball's in the shop. All right. I'll go. But see what you can find out about Murray Drechmeyer. Like is he crazy or reallycrazy? Like what does he have to gain by proving that Eureka's "haunted"? Right. Spirits... We know you're out there. We're all friends. We all believe. Join us. Join the circle. Show us you're here. Sorry... So that's a giant TIRD-grabber? - What? - Ghost whisperer. Sometimes, thermal energy is the final indicator. Visitations are often preceded by other signs. They could be all around us. Drechmeyer... "Madame Drechmeyer." "Madame Cornelia Drechmeyer, the premiere medium of her day, "has contacted more than a thousand spirits on the other side." Spirits, come, cross over from the other side. Sorry. Get over here now! Look out! They came! They heard me! Come on. The desk! I told you they were here. So if you invited them to Caf√© Diem, how'd they end up here? I don't know. But you gotta admit... Showed up when I called 'em. At the wrong location. In a totally different building. So they zigged when they should have zagged. Look, think what you want, Sheriff, but I proved myself tonight just like I said I would. The Drech-man is back in business. The Drech-man? There's gotta be a reasonable explanation for this. Heat waves, St. Elmo's fire. What if Drechmeyer has a reasonable explanation? Come on! Murray's mother, Madame Cornelia Drechmeyer, has made a real name for herself communicating with the dead. What if... What if it's genetic? Let's back burner the whole Addams Family thing for a second. - What's that effect, the... - Casimir effect. What if that had something to do with it? Not without help... The magnitude of apparently what you guys saw here would require some sort of localized focusing device. Like this one? Or maybe these. We've been finding them all over town. They're energy displacement sensors. They're part of my research. They record disturbances in the barrier. - Are you sure they didn't cause them? - Absolutely. You can't just install quantum vibration sensors outside of GD without permission. You wouldn't have given it to me, and this was too important. Which part, the science, or proving your mother wasn't a fraud? What did you tell him? Admit it, Murray. You're obsessed. Do you know what it's like when the other woman is your husband's dead mother? Okay, this has to stop. I'm suspending you indefinitely. Wait. These sensors came from our lab. I designed them. They're just receivers. They couldn't have caused any of these disturbances. Thank you, MB. Hope now you'll start to believe me. I've seen more activity in three days than I have in three decades. Look, something's out there, Sheriff Carter. If we don't help it cross over... who knows what it'll do. His mother was a drama queen too. I think Murray may be on to something. Oh, great. So now you believe in ghosts? The disturbances didn't start until three days ago. Did something special happen here three days ago? We reopened Section Five. Section Five? I hate that section! It can't be a coincidence that Drechmeyer's vibe-finder pinged off the charts on the same day that you took the lid off Pandora's box. Allison! You gotta do something before this gets worse. Okay. Get in. Now, you know that I can't talk to you about things that happen down there. But I can tell you that there is a new project. - Well, can you tell me what it is? - I'm gonna do better than that. I'm gonna take you to the most knowledgeable source... the new head of Section Five. You remember Tess. You're the new head of Section 5? I got bored after I finished planning the baby shower. Carter needs some help with an investigation. There have been some disturbing events around town that seem to coincide with some of the labs coming back on line down here. Yeah, and disturbing kind of sums it up. Just cooperate within the parameters of security. Play nice. Everything would have been fine if he just hadn't shown up. It wouldn't have been fine, because you're still lying to him. - You didn't tell him you're pregnant? - Duncan is a nomad, and I'm liking the idea of settling down here with you guys. - I can't do that to him. - Gee, thanks. No, I mean I can't tie him down. Maybe you should let him decide that. Morning. Weren't you wearing that yesterday? - Yeah, look at that. - Right. You stayed at his place last night. Right, so... where is he? That's a really good question, Duncan, one that deserves an honest answer. The truth is... he's... right here. Doug, sweetie, hi! Come say hi. Duncan, this is Doug. My boyfriend. - You... what? - Yeah. He hates labels. Nice to meet you, Doug. So how long have you two been together? Sometimes it feels like forever, huh? And other times it feels like it's brand-new. Right! Anyway, now that you guys have met... Doug, what do you do for work? Artificial intelligence, primarily. Although I dabble in biotech. Really? Because I've been trying to integrate biotechnological treatment into my epidemiological work in third world countries. Yeah? Well, there are some really promising applications in viral infections, skin regeneration... You name it. Join us for breakfast. Would you? Please? I would love to pick your brain and get to know the man who stole Lexi's heart. What a tangled web we weave. There was a gentleman I had with an abscess across his face... Been a pretty uneventful tour so far. Well, my safety record is impeccable. You've been here for three hours. Do you have any labs that are actually open? There's a working lab right behind me. This one. Don't bother. Johnson said he'll be traveling for a few days. Great, then he won't mind if we look around. So what happens in here? APS... alternate propulsion systems. Like rockets and whatnot. Yeah. That would be the systems we already have. What else is there? You hear that? Do you hear... - That tickles my teeth. Hear that? - Field trip's over. Back on the bus. Let's go. Do you feel hot? - Let's... - Sure. - So you sure you didn't feel hot... - Nothing! At least someone's not so uptight around here. See you around, Sheriff. Just so you know, they've reopened Section Five, and I think it might be related to the disturbances that we've been having... I checked. Everything is fine. The disturbances don't have anything to do with the signal. Good. But the signal is getting stronger. Interesting. Okay, how long... Signal? What signal? Fargo, you know anything about a signal? Dr. Rogers, it's go green month. We need to talk about... - your lab's excess energy consumption. - I was talking to you! I'm detecting a high level of spirit activity in here. Dr. Drechmeyer... That's a strong one. It's me. What spirit activity? Ma'am... - Can anyone see me? - I do. No one sees me either. Do that again! Are we... dead? - Was there a feeling, any sensation? - I don't know. It happened real fast. Okay. I gotta try this. Holy... We can't physically interact with anything in here. Do you have any idea what this means? No! I don't! The universe is revealing one of its secrets to us. You know how rare that is? I mean, this could be right up there with relativity, with Prometheus... We could be dead. Touch me. Oh, just come here. You satisfied? In what way? If we can feel each other, how can we be dead? And why aren't there any other dead people around here besides us, huh? How do you know there aren't? Calling all dead people! Club meeting in the rotunda! See? If we're not ghosts, then... Look, could it be the... the Cashmere effect? - Overpaying for a sweater, are we? - Yeah, overpaying for a sweater. Yeah, Casimir effect. Yes, I know. 1948 theory out of Holland that empty space is actually teeming with fleeting particles and electromagnetic fields. And sometimes in dangerous situations, people use humor to alleviate tension. It's a communications skill. That's my field, actually... one of 'em. I'm actually kind of an expert in a number of some things... What skill are we gonna use to find out where we are if nobody can see or hear us? I have no idea. Well, we rode the elevator. - With karaoke mail guy. - Right. I think bald spots are really sexy on some guys, don't you? You talk a lot. - I told you, I'm a communicator. - Fantastic. - Tell me what you do in Section Five. - Not my information to share. And irrelevant to the current pickle we're in. Pickles are my field, and they usually lead straight to some GD project. See? Just by using the word "pickles," you momentarily relieved my tension, allowing me to refocus on solving our problem. We were still here before we went in there, right? The mail guy talking to us. Remember? So whatever happened... Happened in there. Right. He said that johnson was traveling. - I was here. You were standing there. - Oh, right. I walked over here. We had our hot flash. Right. Right, you tripped on... This is in here with us. And this... looks like a mini version of that. All right, what else is in here with us? Tequila. If fate were kind. How 'bout a body? That wasn't here before. What have you got? Is he dead? No. Not dead yet. Not on vacation either. It's HJ Johnson? The traveler who runs this lab. Okay, his heart rate is stable. He looks dehydrated. - What are those burn marks on his skin? - They're pretty superficial. Well, whatever happened to him really knocked him out. What is that thing you tripped over? It's gotta have something to do with this, right? Portable re-entry pad. - For what, like a spaceship? - Or for us. - Could this have done that to him? - Only if he didn't have it calibrated - properly. - Hold on... - You know what happened to us? - I have a theory. - Well, who the hell am I gonna tell? - Okay, fine. You ready? The fifth dimension. The actual fifth dimension? Yeah. HJ's baby. Interdimensional travel. He must have figured out how to cross over using his p-branes. Well, that cleared it up. The theoretical membrane barriers between all dimensions are called p-branes. Seriously? - Science can't have a sense of humor? - Yeah. Fair enough. It's all based on string theory. Certain levels of subatomic vibration can unweave the p-brane, allowing for interdimensional travel. Okay, so... the platform things... well, looks like HJ figured out how to cross over but knew he couldn't physically interact between dimensions once he got here, so he built a portable version as a way to get back. That clearly didn't work. Well, the p-brane's kind of like a curtain. If you don't pierce through it, you're just gonna make it wiggle. And maybe bump into us on the other side. Tess, we can be the spirits that drechmeyer notices. You're smarter than you dress. What? So you're gonna try to make contact with Murray by talking? It's as good a theory as any. You sure you know how this thing works? Well, I'm hoping it's kinda like Dance Dance Revolution. I'm really good at that. And if you're right, as soon as I turn this thing on, Dr. Spooky's machine should be able to pick up the vibrations from the p-brane, and we might be able to communicate. So for the last three days, Murray's been communicating with HJ? Whenever HJ tried to get back over, it shook the p-brane hard enough to set this guy's dials off. - Let's see if we can do it again. - What if you end up like HJ? HJ had it dialed up to a heavy load. I'm starting at lingerie. Gentle cycle... Forget it. - Are your teeth tingling? - Kind of. Look at that. One, two, three. He heard us. Not really. But if it makes you feel better... you gotta turn on the ghost whisperer so that we can communicate. I can feel you, mother. If you're here, give me a sign. We're here! She's alive. She's alive! - Who's alive? - My mother. On the other side. And I realize the 2000 wasn't nearly as powerful a machine as I needed, so I made some adjustments. Are you crazy? Do you have any idea how much power this electromagnet carries? Enough to cross her over. This boost could be the thing that gets us back to the third dimension. Wait! It could kill us all! Sheriff, I don't know how the two of you got in here, but you don't know what you're doing. The p-brane is sensitive, and I haven't perfected re-entry. It knocked me clean out last time I tried it. It's this idiot and his receptor interfering with my oscillations. - If he turns it on again... - Mother... Come to us. Get off now! No more chances. Give me your badge and turn your equipment and all your research over to Dr. Curtis. But it worked. There was someone there. Your device just fried a multimillion-dollar electromagnet. There is no one on the other side. Except us. Your idea of help was a ghostbuster? A theoretical physicist who veered off track... Lord knows what kind of vibration that charge set off. A p-brane wave of that magnitude could grow to dangerous proportions. You should have thought of that before you tested your platform. You weren't ready for a space jump yet. I wasn't gonna wait for some lady ham radio operator from SETI to come and take all the credit. Guys! So you were saying something about a space jump? Between the third and fifth dimensions. I made it in no problem. Re-entry's proving to be more difficult. Atomic fire. Like when the space shuttle loses a couple of heat tiles. Something like that. We need to get back down to Section Five so I can recalibrate this thing. There's no physical interaction. So we're stuck until someone presses the button. - So you're not in love with him? - Are you kidding me? When I first met him, I knew in ten seconds that I loved him. So what's the problem? What if he doesn't love me? The guy came all the way from Africa to bring you a box of your junk. I mean, if that's not love, I don't know what is. Okay, so what if he loves me, but what if he doesn't love pregnant me, you know? This guy, he builds clinics. He saves villages. He knows Bono. I just... I don't want him to feel trapped, you know? There's only one way to find out. Can I just send him a birth announcement? Watch out! That's no good. Things are getting worse around town. I thought Murray's journals could help. All these calculations are his? Yes. He never let me look at them. I've never really paid attention. - Your husband goes off the deep end... - You try not to fall in with him. Before he became obsessed with his spirits, we were conducting research on vibratory p-brane manipulation. Dimensionality. What if his crazy ghost hunting was... An actual scientific breakthrough? P- branes, shaking between dimensions, Carter's flying espresso machine? - You know what, let's go. - Where? I know a person who actually works with p-branes. HJ, your oscillations seem steep. If I wanted your opinion, I would have asked for it. Why do you have such a problem with me? The whole scientific community has a problem with you. Because I disproved Cook and Moore's half-baked theory about fractals not needing a Hausdorff dimension greater than their topological one? Or because I told a department head at Heidelberg - that he totally need a better toupee? - I'm working here! You really said that? You can't screw around with Hausdorff... About the toupee. Well, it looked like he was walking around with a ferret on his head. As long as you're trying to help, right? And look, if he doesn't go easy on that p-brane the next time through, we're all gonna light up like the JumboTron at Fenway. - Red Sox fan? - How do you think I learned statistics? - That's the only math I ever passed. - Only math regular people need. I believe she just insulted you, Sheriff. That's okay. Listen... - Are you sure about these oscillations? - I'm sure! As long as my equipment's running, I'll be in sync with the p-brane. Once I've calibrate it correctly, I shall pass right through the dimensional curtain and collect my Nobel prize. This is Johnson's lab. - He's traveling for a few days. - Deacon... What is he doing here? Traveling? Then why are his instruments reading out? Is that what I think it is? - It's an EM force field generator. - On steroids. If this has been running the whole time that HJ's been gone, it could be what's been causing the disruption of the p-brane all along. Murray's technology wasn't causing anything bad. It was reading the vibration from HJ's technology. I think we found Carter's ghost. - You are awesome! - We have to shut it down. But that electromagnet is our only way out! - That's not good! - We have to go now! You can't... you haven't finished calibrating! Don't tell me how to work my own device! It's ready. Besides, he shuts down my equipment, and we won't get another chance. - How long will it take? - It'll take a while. Not like there's an on/off switch, thank God. Mary-beth and I have to figure out the exact vibratory coordinates. - On it. - HJ, let me help you do that. If it were anyone else but Deacon, we'd have more time. - We must be doing something wrong! - P-brane waves are getting stronger. Tess, you can't! You can't. - <i>How does it look out there, Jo?</i> - Get inside, people! I'd say it's pretty bad. Henry's working on it. Just try to keep people safe. Tell Carter I've got... everything under control. Isn't he with you? I have to ask what's gonna happen to us if they turn it off before we're back? Do I even have to answer? The way his body skid across the floor... - I guess I owe you an apology. - What? I guess you didn't park your car in the middle of the road, huh? The skid marks. I should have known. No way you skidded your car sideways. But the p-branes do move sideways. What? HJ's oscillations were too steep. - What does that mean? - It means that HJ's aim was way off, and you need to make sure they don't turn that machine off, because I know what to do now. We have to recalibrate this thing. We're getting closer. Just a few more minutes and we'll shut this thing down. Hello, remote calibrator. The GD chopper had an accident. - What? I grounded all air traffic. - It flew off the helipad. Fargo, get over there and man that terminal. - How you doin'? - More time. Come on, Sheriff, do something. Bad news about the p-brane wave. It's growing and spreading across town. Push the button. We're not ready yet. It's delicate. That's it! Can you do to this what you did before in Drechmeyer's lab - with the gentle cycle? - Yeah, I think so, but why? Well, because if Allison knows we're in here, she won't turn off the platform. Yeah, but she can't see or hear you, so... She can feel me. What? Like the way we felt the heat and Murray felt his mother. It's all energy, right? - It all depends on how... - On how you shake the p-brane. All right, hop on. I'll set the platform's power to 50%. Henry, hurry. It's getting hot in here. - Yeah, hold on. - You have to stop Henry. Don't... turn... it off. Try and hold her longer. Tess and I are here. Don't lose us! Henry, Henry, stop. Don't turn it off. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm just feeling really warm. She felt me. - I've got the vertical holding. - Wait, wait, stop! Carter and Tess... I sent them down here hours ago. - I don't understand. - Me neither. I just know that we can't turn that thing off until we find them. Way to go, Carter! She believed you! Guys, you have to see this. It's a projection of the p-brane wave. Now it's just in Eureka, but if we don't calm it down... - Portland, seattle, LA. - Not good. Allison, the wave is growing! We must act now. Turn it off. Crap. You done with that thing yet? As done as I'll ever be. But we're only gonna get one shot at this. You ready? All right, here we go. Three... two... one! What? The wave is dissipating. We've shut it down. Carter, where have you been? It's a long story. Is Tess with you? Yeah, safe and sound. But... we're gonna need a ride. And the Nobel prize. Soon as I work on my aim. Promise me you'll send photos from Belize. Absolutely. You know what? This is getting too weird. He's so cool. He is. So I guess this is it. I guess so. Well, I wish you and Douglas all the best. Thanks, Duncan! For what it's worth... you were the one. I lied. 'Scuse me? I am a big lying liar, and you're perfect, and I don't deserve you. Ready to tell me what's really going on now? Douglas isn't really my boyfriend. I couldn't tell you the truth, which was that I missed you every single day. That's a relief... Because I think he's gay. I should have told you this a long time ago, but I was too afraid that you'd freak out, and the truth is is that I'm the one who's been freaking out. I figured... you'd come around if I was just patient enough. So you're... Twins. So what do you think? I think I'm gonna have to think about this. Busy? Just... clearing Drechmeyer and Mary-Beth to take over Johnson's lab in Section Five. They're working together now. Long day, huh? But at least I spent it in one dimension. You okay? Yeah, I mean, I thought I was dead, and I couldn't communicate with anyone... except you. Carter, is there something wrong? You and Henry are working on something... A signal? And then you invite your friend from SETI... The place where they communicate with... out there. And you put her in charge of a secret project in Section Five. You know that I can't talk to you about this. Well, Drechmeyer was right about one thing. Something's coming. That's the signal...
