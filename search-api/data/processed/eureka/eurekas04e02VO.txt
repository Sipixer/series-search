more comfortable with technology than people. Marry me, JoJo. I don't know what to say. I don't have you here. I just don't know if I can do it anymore. Bye, Jack. I'm pretty sure we're in 1947. You're all from 2010? From the Eureka that you helped create. And now we need your help to get us back. Just for luck. Thanks for getting us home, Henry. And somehow everything is just the same? Isn't that supposed to be granite? If that's different, other stuff could be too, right? Yes, I will marry you. Me marry you? In what universe? Kevin? Honey? Where are you? Relax, mom. I'm right here. Nice hat. I'll be home before dinner. S.A.R.A.H.? You there? Yes, sheriff. Is, uh, is Zoe still at Harvard? Of course she is, Jack. Where else would she be? Look at you, handsome. Mm. I thought you'd never get home. Yeah, me neither. You're... You're not in Australia. I mean, uh, for... for example. Um, yeah, that would be true. [Laughs] S.A.R.A.H., um, can you get Jack some lunch? I think his brain is hungry. Bacon cheeseburger with extra bacon coming up. Okay, well, enjoy. I got to go. Wish me luck. Testing day? We're pulling Tiny out of section five. Taking her through her paces. Yeah, uh, Tiny. Yes. Uh, good luck. Thanks. Jack, is this... Is this about the thing? Because if it is about the thing, then I just need more time to think. Sure. Yeah. I get that. It's the thing. Sheriff, Kevin is at the door. Why are parents so freakin' lame? Holy smokes. Give her a break, Kev. Kevin. Uh, Jack. Ignore him. He hasn't had his lunch. I smell bacon. That's Kevin. So get this. Mom was late this morning, and I didn't get to make it to Dre's. And, I mean, she's always on me about being late. Maybe now she'll realize that time is a relativistic construct and ease up. Yeah, I wouldn't count on it. But, listen, I'm going home before work, so I can take you into town. Cool. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Later, Jack. Yeah. Ha... Have a good day. Hey, dungeon master, when am I getting out of here? I don't know. What'd you do? Nothing. You just like throwing me in jail. So I...I unlocked a few cages. Those monkeys deserve some freedom. Lupo, be a human. I've got a date. A date. With who? You know the blonde chick with the phd in reproductive biology? And we're gonna play doctorate. Get out. Gonna taze me in the ass again? Just get out. [Knock on door] Allison? I'm here, Carter. Hey. Hey. You okay? Well, I came in, and Jenna was with the nanny. And Kevin... Yeah, I... I know. He came by my place. He's different. He stole my bacon. I don't believe it. I mean, he came in. He talked to me. He looked at me. We've changed him somehow. That's not the only thing. Um, when I got back... Uh, Tess was at my place. She never moved away. And from what I can tell, we're still together. Oh... Um... Well, that's good. Happy for you. It's something. I feel like I'm being a jerk to Allison and felt like a liar, not at least trying to explain to Tess what happened. - No, you did the right thing. - Nah. Talking about an alternate timeline could have unforeseen repercussions. What, besides everybody thinking we're nuts? And please tell me this thing's out of batteries. Oh, it still could have enough residual antibaryons to open a wormhole. You know, Allison should get this taken to G.D. Yeah, she's on it. She's also really focused on Kevin. I mean, how could he just change? The perceived present is built on events of the past. Yeah, yeah. Oh, sorry. But, uh, Kevin isn't an event. He's a person. And now he's a completely different person. The causes of autism are not clear. They seem to require a series of genetic and environmental dominoes to fall. So, Henry, do you think it's possible that he did it on purpose? That... no, that he targeted the five of us, he messes with the machine to set us back, so he would change. We're talking about decades of history here. I mean, the calculations of probability and outcome are infinitely complex. Yeah, we're also talking about scary-smart Kevin. But not this Kevin. And that machine was not altered to target specific people. And this Kevin did not send us back into time. Okay, so his intentions... Are locked in a boy whose consciousness of that event no longer exist. Hi, Carter. Hey, sweetie. Hi. All right, you should get up there. - It's almost time. - For? Shut up. Giving speeches is his favorite part of being mayor. He complains, but he loves it. - Ha. - Yeah. A speech for Founders' Day. I'll be right over. She's on the committee. Yes, Grace. And I'm pretty sure I'm married to her. Oh, dear. Oh, yes. Hello, and welcome to Founders' Day. It's a good thing to get together and realize that the past is still very much with us... So Zane un-proposed? I thought proposals were a no-backsies kind of deal. No, he didn't take it back. He never asked me. You see, we never even dated. So how's your day going? Oh, swell. Remember Julia, my sort of girlfriend? Sure. Yeah, we never met. She works for Google, she's, like, a gazillionaire, and she's married to an astronaut. I'm sorry. An astronaut. And other than that cheery chestnut, I seem to be living my same old life, alone. This reality blows. Amen, sister. What's this on your face? Mom, quit it. Nope, not gonna quit it. I'm gonna go get a burger. Try and survive without me. Amazing, isn't it? Good-looking boy you got there. Love what you've done with the place. You did all this to make me feel at home? I don't know what to say. Oh, my God. Could say that, yeah. You're not supposed to be here. I was thinking the same thing. Although the problem isn't the here, it's the now. This doohickey worked. You believe it? It's one of Henry's markers made from your phone. Yeah, when we switched jackets, it was in my pocket. Please. Don't blame yourself. I wasn't planning to. Okay, Carter. Dr. Grant, I know this must be overwhelming for you. We know what it feels like to be pulled away from our own time. Thank you. It's fine here. I just expected... I thought there'd be more flying cars, robotic servants, super highways stretching into the sky. Less '47 Chrysler New Yorkers. But, you know... Well, sorry to disappoint you, but I promise you we will get you back where you belong lickety split. Thank you. Until then, Dr. Blake, would you care for some cotton candy? No, no, no! Can't walk around looking at everything that's been invented since the... telephone. Which was invented in 1876. Stay. Thank you, no. I got a whole new world to explore. Be seeing you. Dr. Grant, please. Just while we talk over the situation. All right, for you. Thank you. I'll be back. Henry. Can I borrow you for a second? Sure. Oh, my God. He had this. That guy's bad news, and we got to get him back where he belongs and fix this. What? There's nothing to fix. Allison, our time journey could have had a huge impact. We don't know if man walked on the moon. We could have changed anything. Yeah, we changed Kevin. - Both: I know. - We know. I'm not gonna lose him again. We have to examine the bridge device. It could be supporting an unstable temporal wormhole. Space-time could unravel. Unraveling space-time is bad. I'll arrange the transport. Things have really changed around here. Eureka is a new town. Let's go. Everybody go! Go! Off! Off the street! Go! Go! Off! Run! Everybody, run! Tiny! Tiny, stop! Stop! Stop! Tiny! Bad robot! Bad! Bad! Stop! The more things change... The more they stay the same. Mm-hmm. Sync by fant0m, corrected by gloriabg Another day, another runaway robot. Anyone hurt? Not yet. I have been working on that probe for ten months! - If you need a probe, Red... - You know what... You, go. Do it. You really think someone messed with your giant bug? Tiny was built to sample atmospheric electricity on Titan. Her power cell was hardened. There was no way it would just short out. Any particular reason you think it was Zane? Uh, because he's a jackass. That's why I kicked him off my design team, Jack. He's in your jail so much he has his own pillow. Okay. If you want to fix the remote, I will find Tiny. Thank you, love. Hey. Hey. [Exhales] That looked... Intimate. This is one of the weirder days ever. What's the story on the time machine? Well, it's not a time machine precisely. I mean, it connects two timelines. Allison's moving it to G.D. To see if it has enough residual power in order to open up a new wormhole. Great. And send Doctor Charming home. And as for our hitchhiker, I designed these markers to detect our temporal anomalies. In order to transport Dr. Grant, it would have had to have been retuned manually. Listen to me. I'm responsible for the greatest scientific experiment known to mankind, and this is the way you're treating me? It's a crying shame, Jack. Well, I know, and, uh, I... Oh, you know what else is a crying shame? Is you trying to strand me in 1947! Where'd you get that idea? Oh, you tweaked my marker so it worked for you, and you risked my life to do it. You just wanted to see the future. And what a disappointment it is. Where a visitor's treated with cruel suspicion and accusations. Future's come a long way. Yeah, well, my cell, my time, my rules. Get comfy. Take a seat. Look at this. You know what this means? I'm fat. In this timeline, I am the fat deputy. Oh, no, ma'am. - Sheriff Andy. - Sheriff Andy? Well, I appreciate the promotion, boss, but I'm still just your deputy. A robot deputy. This thing's really a machine? Yeah. I prefer synthetic colleague. That's a bit more like the future I envisioned. Miss Lupo, why are you wearing my spare uniform? Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. No fiance and no job. Good to be home. Come closer, robot man. You're extremely lifelike. [Chuckles] I'd love to get a look under your uniform. Boss? Tiny gives off an alpha-ray signature, but it's very difficult to follow in this environment. Yeah, but I think we're on the right track. Andy, mind if I test your memory circuits a little? Little game to pass the time? Sure. Yes, how long have you and I been working together? 312 days, 16 hours. And Lupo left when you got here? Miss Lupo wasn't too happy she didn't get promoted to sheriff. Yeah, I, uh... I'm really enjoying this game. Can we do movie trivia next? Sure. Yeah, let's do History. Uh, when did man first walk on the moon? Neil Armstrong, July 20th, 1969. And when did the designated hitter rule come in and ruin baseball? Oh, 1973, but the D.H. Rule actually extended the careers of many stars of the game. Sheriff, do you mind if I shoot a question your way? Yeah, sure. Did you happen to go back to 1947, come back to an altered timeline? That seems a bit of a stretch. Why would you ask? Huh. Well, the questions lead me to think that you're trying to see if history is still the same. That, and the pollen in your hair has pollution consistent of the late 1940s. And our prisoner matches a Dr. Grant that disappeared in 1947 with five other unidentified suspects. I connected the dots. Nice connecting. Thanks, boss. [Mechanical whirring] Well. Did somebody take a tumble? Morning, Chief. Hi. Uh, find an empty lab in section five for the device. Something off of corridor "D" that's quiet. Got it. When did they start calling me chief? Good lord. This is my office? Well, apparently in this timeline, I have no taste. Are you kidding? This is wicked. It's, like, my dream office. Oh... no! Fargo, they weren't calling me Chief. Fargo, this is your office. I'm running G.D.? Tiny's on her way to G.D. I'm just heading back out to the scene, finish my incident report. Paperwork, huh? Big whoop, tin man. I imagine going back to the past will put you in a sour mood. Carter told you? Well, he confirmed a hunch. Don't worry. I know it's all on the down low. I thought you'd be out and about, seeing what's changed. I have no man and no job. That's enough change for one day. No job? Afternoon. Hey. You tell what happened to it, yet? No, still untangling her electrical system. Hey, you want to hold Zane down while I beat the crap out of him, or you want to take turns? Well, we should probably take turns, but, um, usually prefer to have evidence. Killjoy. Yeah. Listen, thank you for finding Tiny for me. You're welcome. You're always there when I need you. Um, listen, Jack. I've been thinking about the, um, you know, the thing. - It. - It. And, um, my answer is yes. Yes. Yes. Absolutely, yes. Mm. Aren't you happy? Oh, you know... [Laughter] Yes, I'm happy. I mean, you look a little shocked. Well, I'm a little... Medic! What happened? Uh, some kind of electrical shock. Don't you love his hair? It's so Fluffy. Fluffy. Fluffy's a funny word. Fluffy. She's a little out of it. All right, well, let's get her into the infirmary. Okay. Did you see... Did you see the big, red elf? Yes. Yes, we did. He's an awesome red elf. It was a big, red elf. Nurse, this woman needs a neuro exam. Where's the doctor in charge? That's you, Dr. Blake. Oh, okay. So, well, then give me a E.E.G., lights, and set up for a portable MRI. Right away. You're the medical director? Don't ask me. Never gonna be able to keep this straight. Is Elvis gonna walk through the door? That would be so cool. We could show him the big red elf. Yes, we could. You know, Allison's gonna take care of you, okay? You understand? I love you. Fluffy. Jack. Hey, Fargo. Got a minute? Uh, Dr. Fargo does not have a minute. But I can squeeze you in for next Tuesday. Larry, I always have time for sheriff Carter. Heard about the promotion. Isn't it awesome? Larry has to do everything I say. Larry, one foot. Now. Uh, look, we got problems. Tess' bug blew again, and, uh, this time she got hurt. Send a basket of mini muffins to Dr. Fontana. Send a team to find out exactly what happened. My day is just packed. Fargo, send a team. Larry, uh, clear my afternoon. You got it, Chief. Hey, uh, where's Zane? I need to talk to him. I don't know. But I'm looking through his personnel file, and he gets in trouble for stupid stuff... Pranks, nothing serious. Where'd you get his G.D. File? You're looking at the head of G.D. Security. But you know I want us to keep working together like normal. You're head of security for this whole place? Yeah. Congratulations. [both chuckle] I'm so proud of you. Thank you very much. [cell phone rings] Hold on. Uh, Carter. Yeah. Ah, great. Sorry, boss. He kind of insisted that I call. That device sends and receives calls anywhere. What do you want? It's possible that I did... Maneuver events so that I'd end up traveling in time, to this time. So you're confessing? You knew the marker was in my pocket... Please, you have to understand, I've been chasing the future my entire life. When the opportunity presented itself, I... I simply couldn't resist. And leaving me back there? Well, sometimes journeys of discovery require a sacrifice. Oh, sure, you were discovering my sacrifice. I'm trying to make things square. I'd rather not waste any more time sitting in here, so if you wouldn't mind just, uh... Oh, grow up. Tried to leave me in another century? You're not getting out of here. Hey, I thought we were square. Ah, we're square. Hey, sweetheart. Grace. You're here working. Uh, no. I'm procrastinating. I was just thinking about coffee. Great minds. I don't want to bug you, but I wanted to remind you about Stan and Jill tonight. Oh, Henry, look, we've already cancelled dinner on them twice. I'm with a project. A 60-year-old gadget that doesn't work means you can't take a dinner break. I'm trying to see if this cell has any trace charge. Okay, I get it. You're working. I'll bother you later. And, um, FYIi, the charge in those cells is building. No, the phosphor is clear. Check the electron drift speed. [Sighs] Okay, you're right. I didn't take into account the 60-year-old conductive materials. Hmm. What, did you think you married a dummy? I guess not. Carry on! Hey, Vince! Oh, you have no idea how good it is to see you. Uh, likewise. Yeah, has Zane been in today? Uh, no, but he should be picking up his lunch order any time now. Okay. Um, uh, one more thing. Do you know if I've asked Tess any big, life-changing questions recently? Oh... my God! You proposed? I did? I don't know. Did you? I don't know. Did I? Oh, Carter! What? Hey. Um, one sec. Look, let's just...Uh, I'll get back to you on this. Can we keep this quiet? I'm the vault. Hi. Hey. So Kevin and I were just talking about his school and other friends and girlfriends. You don't say. [Laughs] We don't have any secrets. I'm gonna get some more coffee. Baby, do you want another shake? I'm good. Thank you. Dude, she has lost her mind. I know. She won't stop touching me, asking me stuff. She keeps feeding me. I know. I know. It's hard watching your kid grow up. Seriously, I... I think she's on drugs. Well, she's probably not on drugs. But, look... Shoot. I got to go. Um, look, you got to hang in there, okay? Have some patience, and we'll talk about it soon. Okay? Zane! We need to talk. So you're thinking that Zane rewired the robot's systems? He has the requisite skills and a shady history. Yeah, but it just doesn't seem like Zane, though. I mean, I always thought that people, at their core, that they are who they are. Well, you'll get a perfect chance to test that theory right here in the new world. Ah, I guess. That would bear out the Novikov self-consistency principle. Yeah, think of time as a pond. When we went back, we made ripples. Those ripples made changes. But the farther away from us you get, the ripples fade. 99.99% of the wider world is the way we left it. Yeah, but we're gonna use the machine or the device to fix that, right? Yes. Yes. The batteries seem to be recharging, and I believe I'll be able to reverse... [Alarm blaring] Our temporal impact. That looks bad. Dr. Fargo was perfectly clear that this entire area of Section Five was off limits. Yeah, use your brave voice, Larry. No one's breaking any rules. Dr. Fargo will not accept it. All right. Well. I gave them permission to use this lab for the project. Thank you, Fargo. Of course, sir. My mistake. Your conference call with the Secretary of Defense is in five minutes. Sorry, Larry. The Secretary of Defense. How cool is this job? Are you here for a reason? Oh, yeah! I got the scans back on Tiny. You got to see this. It's hilarious. Look at those gamma signatures. It looks like there was an overload of positrons. I mean, like that's possible. [Laughs] [Laughs] It's sort of a physics joke, because... I'll redo the scans. Well, I'm glad he's happy, because this may be our reality for a very long time. I mean, I might be able to salvage some parts, but... All right, is there any way to tell if somebody did this on purpose? Sabotage. Um, can't rule it out, though I'm not an expert on the technology from this era. But you know who is. Oh. Dear Lord. Not too shabby, huh? I don't know if you know, but I started this project with a handful of scientists out of some army tents. My lab table was an old munitions crate. Did you ever think it would turn into this? Well, I was always a fella that could dream big, but no. No, not in my wildest imagination. I wouldn't light that. Global Dynamics is a non-smoking facility. Please extinguish your smoking material. What is it? Some... Some kind of mobile patrol system? Please extinguish your smoking material promptly. You might want to listen to her. She? Really? What kind of propulsion system does she... Never mind. Wait a minute. Uh, pardon me. Ma'am. What kind of propulsion system do you use? Have a pleasant day. I think I'm in love with this place. Hey, Allison. Hey. So, uh, Tess is fine. Oh, good. She'll probably sleep for a few hours, but her tests are good. Good. Good. I figured. Look, uh, something happened to the bridge device, and it looks intentional. Yeah, I heard. So if you're gonna ask, ask. Do you know anything about it? You mean did I destroy it? Did you? Have you talked to Zoe? Yeah, she's great. Loving Harvard. Why? Think about what it would be like if you could never talk to her. - Yeah, Allison, I get it. - No, you don't. What if you could never know your own daughter? Never connect to the world the way she sees it? Then I would do whatever it takes to get her back. Fargo said that he saw you going down to Section Five right before the device was destroyed. Yeah, I went down there. I don't know exactly what it was I thought I was going to do. I was denied entry. The medical director doesn't have clearance for Section Five, so I went back. I didn't do it, Carter. But, honestly, I think that I would have. Hi, gentlemen. Any progress? Hey, Carter. You seen this? Uh, what? Excites radiation into a beam that can cut through carbon steel. I don't suppose you've heard of a laser. Uh, yeah, I think I have one in my printer, actually. So was it sabotage? There doesn't seem to be any evidence of tampering, sheriff. You sure? It seems like a stream of antimatter positrons may have overloaded the power system. Well, now Fargo said that's the same thing happened to Tiny. So Zane is, what, firing these things around for yuks? Creating antimatter positrons is incredibly difficult, so if Zane has found a shortcut, he wouldn't be playing jokes. He would be getting a Nobel Prize. I don't believe Zane is responsible, sheriff. I think you were right. Great. So that leaves me exactly nowhere. Might as well start looking for a giant red elf. Excuse me? No, it's, uh, a joke. Something Tess said when she was hurt. She was talking about a... A red elf. Oh, come on. "Elf" is short for emission of light in very low-frequency perturbations. I did not know that. It's a kind of lightning that occurs in the upper atmosphere, along with sprites and blue jets. Didn't you study weather in science class? Well, I remember cumulous clouds, and... No, but this sounds like positronic lightning. That sounds bad. Yeah. It's probably what overloaded Tiny and the bridge device. It's five times hotter than the Sun, but luckily, it's incredibly rare. - Oh, except today. - Right. Plus there's no way I'll be able to predict where it's gonna strike next. [Thunder rumbles, electricity crackles] - Found it. - Uh-huh. Ah. Look at that. That there, now that is a red elf. This... this is insane. Um, everybody, can I have your attention? Need you to go back to your labs, please. Not a drill. Not a test. Off the floor, please. Ma'am, sir, thank you guys very much. All the way off. Yeah, you guys go. You got to go. Back to your labs. Off the floor. Thank you. Go! Nice elf. Nasty weather we're having. Inside. It's a positronic lightning storm. Any idea when it's gonna end? No, since this is the first one that's ever existed. There's strikes all over the building. Andy's moving employees into shielded areas. All right, well, even if you move fast, you're gonna get some injuries. I'll call in a medical team and brief Allison. Okay. The directory doesn't show any projects that could be generating this much positronic energy. All right, how about hobbies? Uh, maybe somebody messing around with test tubes, beakers? Beakers? Beakers? Jack, positronic lightning would be a gigantic project that would require constant adjustment just to keep it from going out of control. But it would be the first steps toward a source of terrestrial antimatter. Uh, limitless, clean energy. Or antimatter weapons. That sounds like something that someone might want to keep secret. A white list project. Oh, great, there's a name for that. A darpa project so potentially destabilizing that it operates with no official record. Yeah, but it would still need the permission of the Director's office. This is the Director's office. If you gave permission before you traversed that wormhole, you would have no memory of it, and there would be no record. Oh, that is trippy. Fargo, if you did this... I didn't. Not you you, but successful you.</i> Where would you put it? I've been very successful in my career. Section Five. But there are hundreds of labs down there. Where would you look? Right where Larry told us not to. Uh... Welcome, Dr. Fargo. DNA scan complete. Iris recognition scan complete. Voice recognition incomplete. Please state your password. I don't know. Guess. Dougie the vampire slayer. Voice recognition complete. Honestly? I made positronic lightning, baby! Not too close. 6 million volts. You got to be kidding. We have to find a way into that lab. Tell me you didn't. Did you get my mini muffins? You built a positronic array in my section, and you made it white list. You hid it from me? He had reasons. Oh, oh, because he's a paranoid, secretive dictator. That is the reason. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. Uh, I...I've never heard you apologize before. To anyone. I'm turning over a new leaf? Please stop yelling at me. Aah! Containment is failing. You think? We have to work fast unless you want the skeleton of this building to vaporize. I vote work fast. We could purge it into the bedrock. We could use a particle drill to sink the ground wire, but we still have to tap the dump coil. - I'll go. - You'll be vaporized. Then I take it back. We can't shut it off without going into the lab, and we can't go into the lab without shutting it off. Can we do it, um, like, with a kite and a key, like Ben Franklin style? Sort of... No, exactly. If we can get the charge to go to one area of the lab... I'm very attractive. I mean, positronically speaking. I'll be the lightning rod. But could you take the pounding? It'll be a couple billion amps. Well, dress me up in some Compton shielding to protect me and draw the lightning, I'll be fine. I think I got just the girl who can lend you that dress. Move, guys. We need the shield to be 980 statcoulombs thick. Hey. Hey. Got a Sec Five pass from Fargo. See if you guys needed any help. Uh, no, Andy's almost ready, and Tess is sacrificing a project she's been working on for a year. And she does it with a smile. She's pretty amazing. Must be why you asked her to move in with you. That's what she was saying yes to. [Stammers] She told me. She was still kind of loopy from the electric shock. We're moving in together? I spent a year realizing we don't work as a couple, we break up, she spends a year thinking it's great. It's just... I guess that's up to you, Carter. Andy moves along the east pylons, attracting the strikes. You don't have much of a window. - Okay. - 74 seconds. 74 seconds? So move your ass, honey. Then across the lab, directly under the capacitor sphere. Uh, the silver thing? Exactly. Then directly behind the sphere is the dump coil. Oh, how do I get the... Every time you say dump coil, it sounds so gross. Right. How do I get to the dump coil? Oh, you got to be kidding. Any chemical propellant would explode. Shoot the bolt into the coil, use the drill to drop the titanium wire. - That should purge the charge. - Okay. Sheriff! What are you doing here? He volunteered. I'm the drill guy. He's the drill guy? This isn't your problem. Sure it is. I've been part of this town for 60 years. I can't to pretend to understand what goes on around here, but electricity doesn't change. I can handle the drill. No, I... Okay. Hey, sheriff, we should get moving. Yippee ki-yay. - You ready? - Uh-huh. Go. Oh! Thought these suits were supposed to protect us. From the charge, not the pain. There's the dump coil. You got 30 seconds, Jack. 30 seconds. I'll drop the ground coil! We should hit bedrock in about 200 meters. About 20 seconds. Any time now. You've only got 15 seconds. [Groans] This wire's awful thin. Titanium alloy. Strong as it gets. You're almost out of time, Jack. Hurry. Bedrock! Good job, deputy. Ah. Hey. You okay there, Tex? Oh, yeah. I mean, don't believe 'em when they tell you that lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place. But, uh, how's Andy? Oh, he'll survive. Fargo said that he needs a complete memory wipe and reload. Oh, that's okay. I mean, he enjoyed the time travel story the first time, so he'll forget, I'll tell him again, it'll... What are you doing here all alone? It's where Zane proposed. And I didn't answer. Ah. Well, everybody freezes the first time in combat. Well, almost everybody. You got scared. Doesn't change how you feel about the guy. You just got scared. I just wish that I said something. You know, I know that it wouldn't make a difference, and I know that he wouldn't remember now, but, you know, at least it would be out there in the universe, somewhere. You know, I love the guy. And he loved me. Once. Hey. Hey. How's my hero? Slightly singed, but I'm okay. Hmm. Um, listen, we need to talk scheduling with the movers, but I'm whipped. Electroshock can be exhausting. Can we talk about it tomorrow? Uh, that would be better. Okay, good. Hey, I'm going to Dre's. We might go see a movie or something. Well, what about dinner? This is dinner. I'll see you later. Love you. Hey, loser. Loser. That, uh, that means cool, right? Hmm. You okay? Yeah. Actually, I'm more than okay. I'm not sure exactly why. I don't know. But it's still difficult. You better get used to it. He sounds like he's a pretty independent kid. Think I'm gonna need help with this teenager thing. I will help you. So, um, the device is dead. And the energy field is decayed beyond repair. So this is home, then? For all of us. Well, what do you know? So how do we tell everyone what happened to us? All at once. Pull it off fast, you know, just like a hangnail. If people find out there's an alternate timeline, it could be destabilizing and dangerous. This is dangerous, having us walk around like we know what we're doing. Yeah, but how would people react? I mean, if Henry tells his wife he doesn't remember her... I'm not saying it's gonna be fun. We need to be honest. Would I still keep my job? Listen, we can't tell anyone. There's a military protocol in place for a situation like this. You're kidding me. No, there's a military protocol in place for everything. Anyone who has seen the future or affected history is inherently dangerous. They can further contaminate the timeline. Violators will be isolated and sanctioned. Um, sanctioned, like, dead? No, sanctioned like we each get a puppy. We can't tell anyone what happened. It has to stay with the six of us. Agreed?
