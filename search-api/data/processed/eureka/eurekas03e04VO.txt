- <i>Sorry, Sheriff.</i> Forget it. I sense a high level of adrenaline in your system.</i> - <i>Is something bothering you today?</i> - Nope. Perfectly fine. High adrenaline can cause physical and psychological reactions.</i> Bandage? - That'll look good at the wedding. - <i>Good thing you're not the groom.</i> What kind of type "a" bride works the morning of her wedding? - Nice cut. - Thanks. There is a condiment dispenser in the refrigerator.</i> That's all right. I like the bottle. I don't know. She called, said she needed my help. So you jumped, like always. No, I didn't. Dad, you're walking the woman you possibly love down the aisle to marry another guy. Okay, first, not true. And second, since when do you and I talk about this stuff? Since I'm 17 and you're in denial. I'm fine. Are you really this hopelessly un-self-aware? - That's my last clean shirt. - Yeah. There's an unexpected visitor at the door.</i> - It's auntie Lex! - Three days early. - <i>Shall I let her in?</i> - Yes! Hello? You look like a supermodel... Every father's nightmare. I love your hair and... your cats. A Tibetan monk told me that Tabby is a reincarnation of grandma Lil. Jackie. You look just like dad... Always ready, always prepared, always uptight. I thought you weren't coming till tuesday. My Seattle chakra conference ended early, and Saturday travel... Always best for Geminis. Right. Well, glad to see you. If you could put the cats in the guest room. And I'll see you at the wedding, sweetie. Nice to see you, too, Monkey. - Monkey? - Don't call me that. Weddings, I love weddings. Okay, be careful with grandma. She's in heat. Shouldn't you be at a beauty parlor or something? What, is it 1960, and no one told me? Relax. We've both done this before. I mean, separately, but... Yeah, but getting married isn't like riding a bike or returning dry cleaning. I mean, getting married should be momentous. Well, redaction is momentous, too, but I owe it to these people to see them through it. Big day. Nervous? I'm not a first-time bride. Sorry I had to call you in, but quarterly balance sheets are due monday. - This couldn't wait. - Another set of layoffs? There's over a dozen people here. Good thing you called in the cavalry. - Blood stain? - Oh, no, breakfast. It's Saturday. It's my last clean shirt. - This is gonna take hours. - Time's a-wasting. Wouldn't want to miss your beautiful wedding. You didn't invite her, did you? No. Look, this whole redaction thing sucks. I'd like to see the Fixer cleaning up excrement. Ye... Look, Lincoln... For what it's worth, we all know that you're the best... excrement guy around. Just remember, today at 6:00 pm, your badge is disabled. - Sorry. - I've been in Eureka for eight years. Kind of hard to go back to the PETCO in Pacoima, you know? Yeah, well, it's been a hard day for a lot of good people. Carter. Bar fight? Shouldn't you be at the beauty parlor? It is your big day. - Supervising an important delivery. - Time-sensitive. - Guys! - Do you need something, Carter? Yeah, I need to find... maintenance. Last guy on my list is... - Weinbrenner. - Basement. Just do whatever you have to do, but, please, don't be late to the wedding and don't forget the necklace. Oh, I can't believe she's marrying him again. I can't believe she asked him to walk her down the aisle. Weinbrenner? Leo Weinbrenner? Anyone here? All right, you just bought yourself an extra day. - You're late. - Yeah, I had to redact 12 people and then find a tie. - The necklace? - What necklace? One of a kind, just like Allie. Don't screw it up. You know, the French give their children wine with dinner. Yeah, dad's never been to France. - If I told you what your father... - He would kill you. That's what aunts are for. A votre santé. Nice, Lex. You're late. I met your sister. Yeah, arrest her for corrupting a minor. Momentous, huh? Yeah. Are you okay? You look pale. That's the white tent. There's something that I wanted to say. Something you should know. I'll always be here for you... No matter what. Everything's gonna work out the way it's supposed to. Love is timeless, transcending everything we know, everything we understand and giving us strength and comfort forever. What is past is now present. And what is present will become your future. That is what love is... Never ending. Now, before you share your vows... If there is anyone here who knows why these two should not be joined together, speak now, or forever hold your peace. What the hell? - Warm! - <i>Yes, Sheriff.</i> I sense a high level of adrenaline in your system.</i> I'm fine. Just a... Weird dream. High adrenaline can cause physical and psychological reactions.</i> Perfectly fi... Bandage? - Sarah? - <i>Yes, Sheriff?</i> - Is the wedding today? - <i>Yes, at 6:00 pm.</i> Good thing you're not the groom. - <i>Is something bothering you?</i> - Yeah. It feels like I was already there. Season 3 Episode 04 I do over (v 1.00) Teams Projet-SG & 6th-Race. Nice cut. Why are you dressed for work? Allison called, said she needed my help. What kind of type "a" bride works the morning of her wedding? Sarah made eggs. Yeah, thanks. - Dad, is something wrong? - Yeah, I'm a little... thrown. Well, no wonder. I mean, you're walking the woman you possibly love down the aisle to marry another guy. Yeah, since when do you and I talk about that stuff? Since I'm 17. You're in denial. - That's my last clean shirt. - Sorry. There's an unexpected visitor at the door.</i> Lex. - How did you know?! - <i>Shall I let her in?</i> Yes. Hello? Zoe. You look like a supermodel... Every father's nightmare. You look amazing. I love your hair and... your cats. Jackie. You look just like dad. And your Tabby looks like grandma Lil. - I thought you were coming on Tuesday. - My chakra conference ended early. And Geminis travel best on Saturday. Okay... If you could put the cats in the guest room. Something to figure out. See you at the wedding. Wedding. I love weddings. I can't explain it. I feel like I've done all this before. We've both done this before, separately. No, not the wedding. I mean, not just the wedding. It's the Ketchup, my sister, this conversation. Big day. Nervous? - She's not a first-time bride. - I'm sorry to call you in, but these quarterly balance sheets are due Monday. - They can't wait. - Another set of layoffs? There's... There's over a dozen people on this. Good thing you called in the cavalry. - Blood stain? - Breakfast. Time's a-wasting. Wouldn't want you to miss your beautiful wedding. See, I knew she was gonna say that. You have to believe me. I've done this before. Carter, no more advice. This is gonna take hours. If we don't start now, I'm gonna be late to my own wedding. Guys. Carter. - Bar fight? - No. I got a problem. All right, Carter, look, do what you have to do. Just, please, don't be late for the wedding. - Don't forget the necklace. - This isn't about the necklace. - Something's wrong with today. - You walking Allie down the aisle? This isn't about the wedding or whether or not I think it's a mistake. - Now it's a mistake. - Yeah... we're supervising an important delivery here, so... Yeah, you know, so why don't I just do it myself? Carter, we're getting married. - She said "Yes". - No, I know. I felt it. I mean, I was there the first time... Second ti... The first second time. - What is wrong with you? - This isn't about the wedding. This is about time repeating. I mean, can it happen? A time loop... The same day over and over? No. Time flows in one direction. If time were to fold back upon itself, it would affect causality. It would delete us from the time-space continuum. It's Allie's big day. - Don't screw it up. - All right. The last time I had Moo Goo Gal Pan, I was in a hut in Canton. So I thought we were gonna get to meet the future Mr. Lexi. Oh, he had visa troubles. Duncan is her gorgeous Dr. Who. Oh, my God! I love that show! Oh, no, World Health Organization. He's an immunologist. I knew that. - Hey, dad. - Hey. You see me sleepwalking last night or talking, anything odd? - Nice to see you, too, Monkey. - Don't... don't call me that. He's just nervous about the wedding. No, I'm not. And don't call me that. Can I get two banana milkshakes? - Bananas calm Monkey down. - Coming right up. There have been documented cases of repetitive cognizance brought on by extreme psychophobia of a certain upcoming event. - So tell me, what's my psychophobia? - Okay. This Allison... You like her. Right? Can't stand the thought of her with another guy forever. I mean... Okay, let's say... - I'm conflicted. - Have you told her? Okay, there's your problem, Sheriff I'm-not-a-sharer. So I'm stuck in this day until I tell her how I feel? You can't just tell her. You have to kiss her. It's the only way to know, on a truly cellular level, if your energies are meant to combine. There's a science to this love stuff, but why start taking my advice now? Honestly, because you are the only one who believes me. That's what family's for. Carter, you can't go in there. Carter, you're early. - Yeah, and you're... - Not ready. Are you okay? You look pale. I'm not... a sharer. Hey... What is it? So you thought that coming here and doing that right before the wedding, that that's a good idea. No. My sister did. Look, I'm not gonna deny that... that, you know, maybe... Look, it just... It didn't work out that way. I love Nathan. We have a history. - And you and I could've had a future. - You'll always be my friend... My true friend. I'll always be here for you. You know that, right? I mean, no matter what. Everything's gonna work out the way it's supposed to. And now, before you share your vows, if there is anyone here who knows why these two should not be joined together, speak now, or forever hold your peace. I sense a high level of adrenaline in your system.</i> Is something bothering you today? I think today is yesterday... Again. - Saturday again. - Again? Allison called. What kind of bride works the morning of her wedding? Sarah made eggs. I know you like the bottle. Not today. - You didn't shave. - Safety precaution. You are freaked out about the wedding. You're right. And I'm totally self-aware. You and I should talk more now that you're 17. But I gotta check out a theory I came up with. - In the bathroom? - You'd be surprised what happens there. Aunt Lex is coming today with two cats that should go to the guest room. And get to know the Tabby, you might be related. I'll see you at the wedding. Got to go stop time. And drinking age is 21. Supervising an important delivery? - Time-sensitive, Fargo? - Yeah, I guess you could say that. Could you say it's a device that could've created a time loop I've been living in for the last 3 days? Fargo, tell him what it is. It's our new sub-femtosecond atomic clock that'll make GD the constant for time in all the known universe. - Those Swiss guys are really fuming. - And today's the day you plug it in. It runs on unstable plutonium neutrons, not AC. Isn't that unstable? Of course, 'cause if they were stable, they would split during... - Why am I explaining this? - Don't ask why. Don't take that thing out of its container until after your wedding. Okay, we'll trust your gut and miss our only sync window between now and 2036. - Not! - We're ready to move. Don't do this. We're all stuck in some weird time thing where things keep repeating. Yeah, and only you remember it. Carter, this is a very important project. Don't screw it up. Allison's director of operations. Why don't you ask her to cancel synchronization? Well, because you'd still have to approve. And I won't. This clock gives GD universal ownership of time. I know. I know. And the Swiss are fuming. But if you plug this thing in, we'll be doomed to repeat this day forever. The happiest day of my life? Sorry I had to call you in, but quarterly balance sheets... Quarterly balance... Forget it. If we don't stop it from turning on, you'll have the rest of eternity to redact those 20 people. - You said a few nonessentials. - Time's a-wasting. Don't want you to miss your beautiful wedding. - You should've invited her. - Carter, what is wrong with you? Nothing. Nothing you'll remember. We just need to stop that new clock. You're making me nervous. I just want to get through this. Well, you won't. We're gonna do this again and again, unless right before 6:00, I unplug that clock. And then this horrible day will be over. I know you think that I'm making a mistake. And I am touched - that you care so much about me. - Of course I... Look, I just need you to be there for me today. Well, I'll always be there for you. And... If I am late tonight, just know that I was fixing something that's broken. Everything's gonna work out the way it's supposed to. So, 6:00 pm? That's when this thing goes off? That's when the official switchover from greenwich happens. But now it is time to get married. In some cultures, teenagers are guided through mind-altering experiences by trustworthy elders to expand their consciousness. Well, in this culture, the drinking age is 21. The French give their children wine with dinner. Yeah, dad's never been to France. If we're late to the wedding, I wonder who'll kill us first, Dr. Stark or Dr. Blake. Well, nothing matters now, but... Unplugging this unstable plutonium thing. I thought you said we were here to take emergency readouts for Thorne. I lied. - Turn it off. - No. - Now. - What is wrong with you? Easy way or hard way, Fargo. We don't have much time. Apparently we don't have much sanity either. I'm not crazy. Says the guy with crazy eyes and a gun. This will all make sense once we stop the time loop. Which one is it, Fargo? So much for my career. There really was a plug? For the vacuum seal. Now that it's broken, so is the clock. And all the plutonium? Yeah, it's safe. Let's get married. The past is your present. And your present will... The present will become your future. Sorry. That is what love is... Never ending. Now, before you share your vows... I sense an abnormal level of adrenaline in your system.</i> That's because things keep bleeding through. - Guys. - Carter. Bar fight? Actually, the flow of time is changing. This cut isn't from shaving. I carried it through a time loop that keeps affecting, something you said I don't remember, and maybe deleting us from the universe. - So just listen, and don't call me... - Crazy? - That's not listening. - I heard you, but do you really think there's a possibility that there's a break in the space/time continuum, and I don't know about it, but... you do? Does your ego even fit in this building? How many times do I have to go through this... Before I realize that you can't change someone's mind? New tactic. GD has a volcano guy, a drone guy, even a poop guy. Who is the time guy? Weinbrenner. Carter, you do what you have to do, but, please, don't be late for the wedding, and don't forget the necklace. Wait. Leo Weinbrenner? The maintenance guy? That would be time maintenance. All right. Okay... I gotta go. Carter, I just left you a message. Thorne called me in. Yeah, I know. She's gonna ask you to redact some more people. - Figured you could use the help. - Oh, not more layoffs. What happened to your face? It's a long story I don't think you'll believe. Can we have a private moment? Can I talk to you? I wanna talk to you... about something you told me once, - and I think it's... Important. - <i>Leo Weinbrenner.</i> Leo. One second. - Sorry. - No. Go ahead. Thanks. You're in charge of time, right? The guy in the basement? - Was, until today. - Right... I've been repeating the same day over and over. I mean, is it possible? Can time just loop around like that? You're asking the wrong guy. I just oil the gears. Is there any reason why Thorne would wanna get rid of you today, so that you wouldn't help us, so that you couldn't discover it? I wouldn't put anything past her. She's up to something with that clock. Don't know what, but it can't be good. Nothing that woman does is good. Anyhow, I'll... sign those redaction papers whenever you bring them by. I'll need all the calibrated equipment in a truck by 5:00 at the latest. There's a time factor here, and I don't wanna miss my window. Sheriff, eavesdropping is a very nasty habit. No, I'm just checking in, seeing if there's anything I can do for you today. - As a matter of fact... - Oh, redactions! Oh, boy! I love a good culling of the herd. Leo Weinbrenner... Any particular reason you're getting rid of him? Dr. Stark is installing a new clock that performs the same functions as Weinbrenner does, without requiring health care. Sub-femtosecond? I bet the Swiss are fuming. I was wondering if you wanted to be my date to the wedding. - I can pick you up around 5:00. - No, thanks. I think you heard I've got something important pending. - Well, you'll be missed. - No, I won't. Speaking of work... Sorry I had to call you in. Quarterly balance sheets are due... On Monday. And this can't wait. Sheriff, make sure she doesn't miss her beautiful wedding. - What's that about? - You should've invited her. I mean, he's your gorgeous Dr. WHO. Oh, my God. I love that show. World Health Organization. He's an immunologist. Oh, no, I knew that. Duncan's work is everything to him. I can't ask him to give it all up and move here just for me. It's not just for you. I didn't tell him, Zoe. I want someone to be with me for... the right reasons, not the responsible ones. Speaking of responsible ones... Hey, Dad, look who's here! Three days early. Cats in the guest room. You look terrific. Has anyone seen Henry? He's not answering his phone. - Aunt Lexi wants to stay for a while. - Great. I got a big problem now. And I really need to contact Henry. Zoe, it's OK. He doesn't have time for me. Oh, come on, Lex. You go away for six years, and I'm the bad guy? - I was working. - I am working. Look, once things return to normal, we can sit down. We can have a nice long conversation. So you can give me that speech about how I need stability and I need to settle down and get a real life. I don't know. Maybe. I guess my mistake was thinking I could do that here. Way to go, Dad. Honey, she's been doing this her whole life. She lives by whims and then makes everyone else's life crazy. Aunt Lexi's pregnant. She came to us for help because that's what family's for. I'll fix it. Something big down there, huh? Seems... - complicated. - It's very complicated, Sheriff. Would it have anything to do with why you fired Weinbrenner today? Is it a coincidence you fire him the same day that you have something secretive to do out here with all this... well-calibrated equipment? Say what's on your mind, Sheriff. Everyone in town is at this sweet, little wedding except you. And you're out here manipulating time, making us repeat the same day over and over, and you don't know how dangerous that is. - You're wrong, Sheriff. - Maybe. Mind if I see that? Not at all. What do I press to send myself back to the shower? I'm sensing broken bones, lacerations, and contusions.</i> Shall I call 911? I don't know. Only if they can fix a hole in the universe. Sit down. So you say you... You came through with this? Yeah, it's what Thorne used to create the time loop. No, this device is not a time-control device. This device is a geological depth finder... An MRI for rocks. As a matter of fact, why don't we see what she was up to? She was manipulating time, probably using that clock that Stark just hooked up. No, these are spatial measurements, compartments deep in rock and man-made. Okay, then, Weinbrenner... She fired him so he wouldn't stop her. - You know him? - We worked at Nasa. He was a temporal physicist who was working on the EPR paradox. Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen. Anyway, he had this theory about bending light to alter time, which he almost got to work. He lied to me. He made me think it was Thorne who was behind it. It wasn't Thorne. It was him. Jack, bending time is impossible. He knew he was redacted before Thorne even told Allison. I guess redaction starts pretty early around here. See, Leo, that's the problem. It is too early, and Thorne hasn't laid anyone off yet. So... How could you know that? I knew you were on to me the last time through. Why didn't you say something? I was afraid you'd shut me down. Then I'd never have a chance to fix it. Tell me what you did. Ultra indigo... It's the closest light frequency to pure black. Strictly theoretical, until now. Oh, my God. What is this? Perfectly harmless... Exactly what Einstein theorized. Am I getting radiation poisoning right now? No. See, any particle that reflects ultra indigo won't move along with the normal spectrum. So this indigo stuff created the time loop? Nope. That's... what this particle decelerator is for. Okay. I'm lost. I made one photon of light travel slower than the speed of normal light. Its reflection caused a chain reaction that made all light travel slower back to an exact point in time that I chose. So you made time flow backwards? Yeah, only something bathed in ultra indigo wouldn't be affected. So... That... The morning when I came into your lab... I was sending the photon back. I stood in the ultra indigo field so that I would stay the same while the universe traveled backward around me. But the light must've hit you, too, and trapped you in this day with me. I'm so sorry. Sor... Look, just... make it go forwards again. Reset the... photon thingy. What do you think I've been working on in here every day? - And it just keeps getting worse. - You don't know how to reverse it? Isn't that like jumping out of a plane, trying to invent a parachute - before you hit the ground? - Look, I had to. I was being redacted. Thorne made it very clear I had to vacate the premises by 6:00 pm. She didn't care how close I was. So, Leo, is this time loop permanent? Just until I figure out how to get things back to normal. But I gave myself all the time in the world... ten hours at a time. Or until the time wave that split the sky and broke my ribs deletes everything in the universe. I didn't expect that to happen. I'm working as fast as I can. Okay. And you can do that with... all this? Almost. I've got everything down except for the timer. I haven't had time to invent it yet. Ironic, huh? How are you gonna... I'm gonna use my baby, the GD clock. I go in and manually connect both devices at the precise moment of synchronicity with the time-space continuum. All goes well, I come out normal, and time will be on its linear way. Look, Sheriff, if this doesn't work... I'm not gonna be able to help you the next time through. It'll be Dr. Stark that you need. Well, he'll never believe me. Well, he will... if I teach you this. Oh, dude. The clock's calibrated to link up with the accelerator 30 seconds from now. Sequence commencing in 30 seconds. We've maybe got one more time through the loop, two tops before things start being deleted for good. If I don't... Sequence commencing in 20 seconds. Just know that I never meant any harm. - You'll get it right. - <i>Sequence commencing in 10 seconds.</i> Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Zero... Leo. No! No! One more chance. Weinbrenner died trying to reaccelerate time. Carter, you're crazy. Fargo, tell him why he's crazy. Hold on. All right... "t" times the square of one minus "v" squared</i> over "c" squared where "v" is greater than "z" Wait a minute. Where "v" is greater than "c." Yeah, greater. Yeah, yeah, that's the formula for breaking the light-speed barrier. - Where'd you learn it? - Hey, we have a problem. Leo Weinbrenner's charred body was found in the time maintenance room. - Henry's coming in to do an autopsy. - Good. Good, he'll know about the time loop. Carter? You got a second? One sec. What, you want me to sing another verse? No. I believe you. If what I'm looking at is correct, none of us may make it through the next time wave. It's Allie's big day. Keep this between us? Sure. So shouldn't you be at a... a beauty parlor or something? What, is it 1960, and no one told me? There's something I wanted to... Say to you. I know... that you love Nathan and that you guys have... this history. And you're gonna have a great future. I think this time we just might. But... Make sure you get him to the wedding on time. Count on it. All right. Weinbrenner jury-rigged the old GD clock to the accelerator. Yeah, he did it manually because he didn't have the time to create a new timer. I was here... Well, there. But I was here. Well, it must not have been accurate enough. No. But yours is. The new clock, the one that the Swiss are fuming about. Carter, sometimes you're smarter than you look. Fargo, we have an important delivery to supervise. Hey, Zo. She is? Cats, yeah, just put them in the guest room. And if you guys could go to Café Diem. Yeah, I'm gonna be a little busy later, but... I don't want to miss spending time with you. Okay. But, I mean, he's your gorgeous Dr. WHO. Oh, my God. I love that show. No, World Health Organization. Hi, guys. Dad, - What happened to your face? - No, I'm... I'm all right. Duncan is an immunologist. He and Lex have spent the last six years traveling around doing... good things. No, I knew that. Here I thought you never read my letters. Nah. What happened? Did you crash your big wheel again? Nice. I missed you, Monkey. I missed you, too, Stretch. You haven't called me that since I was 12 years old. - You used to hate it. - Because I was this tall in 7th grade. Well, fair enough. You know, I'm... I'm glad you came early. It's good to be able to see you before... Before what? - Before the wedding. - I love weddings. They're final yet festive, like funerals with champagne. I got something to take care of. Just thought I'd come by and say... that I love you guys. Since when have you become this self-aware? I can learn. It just takes me a few tries. And, - you guys helped. - Well, that's what family's for. Yeah. It is. Oh, just... ditch grandma Lil for me. If none of this is true, we accelerate a photon beyond the speed of light, and it ends up creating a time hole and destroying the universe? We have two choices, Fargo. Either we trust Carter, or we don't. Guys, we close? Yeah, this new clock should sync up with the accelerator, theoretically. I did what I could to shore up the seal, but it's not meant for this kind of use. All right. It's almost 6:00. All right, Fargo. Start her up. If the seal holds, we accelerate the photon, and time gets back to normal. What happened? We lost the seal. We can't sync the clock. What do we do? We do it manually. From the inside? Like what Weinbrenner tried? We got less than 60 seconds. I'll do it. Tell me what I need to know. I can't teach you a song for this one, Carter. It's a little too complicated. But not for me. I know how. I'll do it. I always knew you had it in you, Fargo. I didn't. But I helped build this thing, and we only got one shot. Go sync me up, okay? Are you sure? What about Allie? What if you can't... Of course I can. My ego's bigger than the building, remember? 30 seconds. You got the necklace, right? Yeah, I do. Well, make sure she gets it and that she knows I did this for her. And take care of her, Carter. She'll need you. Dr. Stark. Keep pushing buttons, Fargo. Sequence commencing in 20 seconds. Sequence commencing in 10 seconds. I'll see you around, Jack. Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Zero... He did it! You did it! We're moving forward! Yeah... We are. He's gone. He's really gone. I can't have any because of baby Carter, but don't let that stop you. You know, the French give their children wine with dinner. Dad? You're late. Oh, what happened? Hey. You ready? Momentous, huh? Yeah. I'll always be here for you. You know that, right? No matter what. Are you okay? You look...
