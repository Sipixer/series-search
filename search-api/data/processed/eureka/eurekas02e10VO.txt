There's only one thing I want from you, Jojo. - What is that? - It's a modified version of the memory neutralizer that I designed years ago. Can I borrow this? Sure. We've been searching for a... unifying theory of everything. You're talking about the akashic field. Just wish I could see what was going on inside of his head. Why this is happening to him. His brain is wired like no one else's. He's created a connection to the field. Albert Einstein said science without religion is lame,</i> and religion without science is blind. But is there still a place for faith in a world of science? Has our ability to unravel the mysteries of rainbows made them any less miraculous? Science may be the method by which we give name to God's miracles. But faith is the question that arises every time an old mystery is solved. The elegant explanations discovered every day in Eureka are the very reason to believe in something greater. Something beyond mathematics. Something divine. Dad! Hey! What are you doing here? I was just cleaning out my closet for donations, as requested. And... I brought you breakfast. Thank you. Now... What is it? Scrambled egg whites with spinach and tofu. SARAH said your cholesterol's been running high from too much pizza. That's crazy talk. Almost forgot. I got you your sunday paper. Here you go. - What do you want? - Who said I want anything? It's sunday morning. You're up before noon. You do chores. You bring me the morning paper. What do you want? I wanna get a tattoo. No! Okay, I'm being serious. Oh, okay. No. - Can we talk about this? - Sure, yeah. We can talk about it. And the answer is... No. Are you amused with yourself? I'm pretty amusing. Gotta drop this off. I am so telling SARAH. Thought-provoking sermon, Reverend. I mean, the most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mysterious. I couldn't agree more. Unfortunately, I'm literally preaching to the choir. You knew you were gonna have a small crowd when you took the job. It's not the size of the congregation that counts. It's... The commitment. Still, a little more size could be nice. Mom? And a little more time. Excuse me, Reverend and Henry. Diane, another lovely musical arrangement. Thank you very much, Reverend. How are you? Hanging in there. - You know, working helps. - Tell me about it. Anytime you need to talk, drop by. I will. Thanks. - Bye, Henry. - Bye-bye. How many people could understand the pain of losing a spouse? Well, we all deal in our own way. I'm glad you've been there for her. Yeah, me too. Thanks. - See you next sunday? - Absolutely. Sheriff Carter. Hi. You're early... For next sunday. Yeah... It... It's Jo's day off, and I drew the short straw. So... what have we got there? Donations... Spring cleaning. We'll make sure we get these to those in need. A lot of need. It's not even mine. I blame you for her death. I can't look at you without thinking that you did this. That you're the one who took her away from me.</i> You okay, Sheriff? Yeah, I just... remembered who I borrowed this from. Well, if you ever want to borrow my book... - Yeah. - See you next sunday, maybe? I'll work on it. I'll put these up front... For you. I kind of wish I hadn't even told him. I don't understand the appeal of painting oneself permanently.</i> Maybe because, in your case, it would be considered graffiti. I thought every kid from LA had a tattoo. Oh, yeah, and preschoolers have body piercings. Haven't you guys ever been to, like, a big city? Nope. Oh! We did have that one wild weekend in Vegas. We did. - Really? - Okay, so it was a virtual Vegas, - but it was like we were there. - You really need to get out. I'll tell you what. This weekend, we'll take my car and we... Well, what? Don't leave us in suspense. Spit it out. - Zoe, what's wrong? - I can't talk. Should I alert sheriff Carter? Zoe? Pilar? What's happening? - What's happening to me? - The Projet-SG Team presents: Timing: Golgi, Linwelin, Moochie, Ricana. Transcript:   swsub.com Edition: Golgi, Linwelin, Moochie, Ricana. Proofreading:   Golgi, Linwelin. - Season 2 | Episode 10 - God is in the Details (v. 1.03) What exactly are you doing? It's a portable MRI. Allows me to see inside her throat. - You're making her nervous. - Just tell me what's wrong with her. I don't know, it's not laryngitis. They're suffering from some sort sort of vocal cord paralysis. From what? I'm not sure yet. Okay, I'll... Hang out while you tinker with her voice box. I don't tinker. Carter, just... Give him some time. Yeah. I know. I know. Me too. Everything's gonna be all right. He's pretty good at what he does. We're gonna keep Zoe and the other girls here for observation at GD. Until we have an answer. I'm gonna check out the house. Just... See if I can find anything. I already sent a science team. They can handle it. Yeah, I'd prefer to do my own digging. It's... I'll see you soon. Okay? What is that? What... What?! You... God! So you weren't asking for permission to get a tattoo. You were just covering your ass, right? Is... You know, I'm just gonna do everything I can to get you healthy. And then we're gonna talk about that. So... sunday special is fallout flapjacks. That's pumpkin pancakes with radioactive swirl of cream cheese and nutmeg. That sounds great, Vince, but I'm waiting for somebody. Really? Who's the lucky lady? No! Yes. I'm impressed. Yeah, so am I. And just a teeny bit scared. Yeah. If all church girls look like you, I might consider converting. You should join me sometime and find out. Oh, I would, but I'm allergic. I'd have to... get a new inhaler. It'd be a whole... Thing. - After you. - Chivalry. Not something I was expecting from a felon. Hey, never convicted, but the day is still young. Try anything, and I'll deviate your septum. That is so hot. I'm sorry, Sheriff. It was my responsibility to keep an eye on them, and I failed.</i> - <i>Bad house.</i> - It's all right, SARAH. One minute, they were talking about tattoos,</i> the next, they couldn't speak. I was against her getting one, by the way.</i> Well, not that it helped, but thanks. Did you run tests on the air? Did you check the filters? If anything unusual had been detected, I would have sealed off the affected areas.</i> Where were they? In the living room. What is that? I don't know. It wasn't there before. Neither was that. This is truly a mystery. This shouldn't happen. Crystalline glass is made of atoms that bond with more density than ordinary, making windows stronger, more light resistant. - More thermally efficient. - What could do it? It'd take an incredible heat source. SARAH checked. Said there was no trace of heat in the house. Like I said, it's a mystery. I need help. Zoe can't talk. - You checked... GD's entire... - Active project roster. Of course. But nothing would cause a problem like this. - Well, something caused it. - Jack, we're doing all we can, as fast as we can. So why does a special forces bad-ass quit a life of excitement to become the deputy of Sleepy Hollow? Well, same reason an anti-establishment anarchist agrees to a cushy consulting job at Global Dynamics. The money... You wouldn't believe what they're paying me. Well, the opportunity. You know, this isn't just anywhere, it's Eureka. True... If I'd come here sooner, things may have turned out differently. Like you wouldn't have gone to MIT when you were 15? Actually, MIT was great. I could spend weeks at a time focused on a single variable in a lattice gauge equation. It was heaven. I had the same feeling assembling a chromium flash suppression barrel for my grenade launcher. Yeah, but that's simple mechanics. Particle and theoretical physics, that's the real mind, Candy. Well, some of us like practical application. Oh, yeah, no. That's all good. But, I mean, let's be honest. The particle accelerator only gets built after someone comes up with the idea. Right? So how about a Vinspresso to top things off? That's an excellent idea. No, thanks. - Should be getting back to the office. - I thought you had sundays off. Yeah, just remembered, I have some paperwork I forgot to finish. Thanks for brunch. - <i>Hello?</i> - <i>Still can't find the cause, but</i> the good news is, it's not getting any worse.</i> Well, I guess that's something. Are you doing okay? Yeah, just... Seeing Carter so worried about Zoe just got to me. - I know how he feels. - <i>Well, try and relax.</i> You been under a lot of stress lately. I'll keep at it 'till I figure something out. I know you will. - Good night. - <i>Good night.</i> What in the world? Hey, there. Welcome back. - What's happening to me? - Apparently your inner glow is becoming your outer glow. Please don't joke. What were you doing before this happened? I helped Kevin with his homework. Then I took a shower and... So Kevin was home. - Yeah. Why? - I wonder if he was responsible. - Why would he... - I don't know. But we've seen what kind of power he has. If I'm right, and he's tapping into the akashic field, then he's... tapping into a very powerful energy collective. Holy crap! What did you do? I took a shower. You look radiant. We tested the water. Nothing in it could cause bioluminescence. How does it happen? Enzymes in the skin pigment become oxidized, and then they emit light. But that's with insects and marine life. Not anymore. It may be a kind of bacterial reaction. Okay, you know what? Glowing or not, I'm still the head of GD. - And unless this is contagious... - No, no, no! - I gotcha. - The human body is not built for this. Whatever is causing your bioluminescence is also attacking your nervous system. Allison, does GD have any projects in bioluminescence in development? Not at GD, but maybe off-site. And you're not gonna like who the project manager is. Why do you automatically assume I'm responsible? Are you really surprised? I work in bioluminescence now, Sheriff. Ever since you torched my necrosomnium violacea, I needed a change of scenery. I'm a busy man. Do you mind getting to the point? The point is that Allison Blake is shining like the northern lights. - Fascinating. - Seth, what's the new project? Botanical marine cross-hibernization to create bioluminescent specimens. I mate plants and fish to make them glow. Why would you do that? That's classified. The head of Global Dynamics is a human glow stick, so unclassify it. I've only just isolated the mitochondrial strains responsible for bioluminescence. Phase one includes simple organisms. Let me guess... Phase two is human trials. Well, yeah. But I'm years away from that. Still gonna need a sample. - Waste of time. - Ah, we'll see. Until then, don't leave the aquarium. At least you can't light it on fire! Sorry I couldn't be here sooner. You okay? We're still going over the smart house, and Fargo is running a full diagnostic on SARAH. Okay, so don't worry... We'll find something soon. How'd it go with Zane? We can talk about that later. Or now. Or now. Bottom line: he's... brilliant. I'm not. It's the story of my life trying to get a date in this town. He likes you. But how long before he realizes I can't keep up with him? Anyway, I'm more concerned about you. I'll live. I'm worried about Allison. I know. Me too. What the... Why is it every time you show up, my work gets ruined? I'm not the one who turned your aquarium into a theme park for the Shining. I didn't do this. This just... happened. This doesn't just happen. Water doesn't turn into... Blood? That's what you're thinking, right? - Yeah. - Great. Then you can deal with this. I don't do blood. I'm a plant guy. What's that? It's a filtration system. Or it was. There was a hole like that at the smart house. What does that have to do with this? Exactly. Hey, who's gonna fix my tank? No one. This just became a crime scene. - Well, we didn't notice any before. - Yeah, we weren't really looking. - Bingo. - Everything that's happened is related? Yeah. But I'm not sure to what. What'd you find out? That the smart house had a circle of melted glass, as did Allison's house, and Seth's aquarium. What happened at the aquarium? The water in the marine tanks turned to blood. - Or a blood-like substance. - You test the water? Yeah, it didn't match when we compared it to her chem panel. - How bad is she? - Whatever's triggering Allison's bioluminescence is working as a neurotoxin. It's shutting down her bodily systems. Now, the reason I brought her here is I've been working on a nerve agent antidote for the military. Can you give it to her? He can't. It doesn't exist yet. But you're close. How much time does she have? - Now, Carter... - How long? 12 hours. Maybe less. Hey... You okay? What's happening? Well, we... We've got a few more incidents, so... - <i>A few?!</i> - Yeah. We're gonna figure this out. You're gonna be fine. Okay? But... About your tattoo. I overreacted. I didn't hear you out. And... that's just... I'm sorry. I mean, I do think what you did was wrong. But... It's a tattoo. That's just... not important anymore. I... think you should just focus on getting better. Okay? Am I going to die? No! I was trying to... I just... No, you're not gonna die. We got it all under control. Just hang on one second. Okay? - Hope you have some good news. - You were right. All the glass melted the same way from the inside out. And all the locations affected were using crystalline glass. Guess that's why every window in Eureka didn't go all Salvador Dali. Exactly, so I'm gonna run this data with Nathan. - Maybe the break we were looking for. - Great. Hey... - Thanks. - Keep the faith. Believe me, I'm trying. Well, Henry just figured something out that might help us, so... You just hang in there. Okay? Hey, Larry. What, studying to be pope? No. But with what's happening around town, I thought I should cover my bases... Religion-wise. What's religion have to do with anything? Well, call it what you like. But girls losing their voices... That's like the Tower of Babel. God smote those workers so they couldn't communicate. And Dr. Blake... Glowing, like saints rising to heaven. That's what the Bible calls trans... Transfiguration. What if GD was built over a Hell mouth? - A Hell mouth? - Say what you want, but when water turns to blood, I say it's time to pray. You might wanna run that by the reverend. Sure she'll get a laugh out of it. Considering she's the one I borrowed these books from, I think I'll stick to my game plan. - Harper gave you these? - She's giving them to everyone. Things are happening all over town... In case you haven't noticed, God's come to Eureka. - Thanks. - For what? You may have pointed me down the path of righteousness. - Hallelujah, my brother! - Shut up, Larry. Excuse me. Do you know where I can find the reverend? She just stepped out, but she'll be back for evening service. And... All these people? They just come here to pray on their own. - Sure. - People seek comfort in time of crisis. And reverend Harper's door is always open. - How long've you known her? - I have been the church's musical director since day one. So... A while. Don't take this the wrong way, but I hear the... sunday sermons aren't quite... selling out. - Please. - Sure, sure. Eureka's built on science. So it's hard for people here to just open up to something as uncertain as faith. Reverend Harper was a theoretical physicist, so she has a way of bridging that divide. And, as a churchgoing scientist, I appreciate that. Do you believe in miracles? - I have to. - And, what if they're just being used to get people in the pews? Reverend's only concern is helping others. - Sure about that? - She helped me. When my husband Daniel passed away, I wanted to... Join him. And the reverend showed me that where there is faith, there's hope. She saved my life. Okay. It must be pretty bad. I am running through every variation of the neurotoxin antiserum. I will find the solution. Except I probably won't be around for it. - Let's discuss worst-case scenarios. - Not yet. I have to. For Kevin's sake. Nathan, if something happens to me, I need you to take care of him. You know I would. And I want you to tell the DOD what's happening. No. No, not yet. One more hour, I'll know if this last trial worked. What if I don't make it through this? You will. You have to. I love you. I won't let you die. I won't allow it. We're getting reports all over town. I promise he'll get to you as soon as he can. You should really wear your hair down more often. Really not a good time. No, I got that impression when you took off. Look... Forget it. It's nothing. I think it is. Tell me why you're pissed, or I'll hold my breath until you do. - What are you, three? - Hey, I black out, it's on you. Okay... You didn't do anything. It's me. It's this whole town. Is this about the whole miracles thing? 'Cause, seriously, there's no such thing. Right, because only dumb people believe in something beyond tachyons and particle accelerators. Maybe you should think this through before you start making accusations. Accusations against who? I tried to call you, but my radio's out. I think reverend Harper might be responsible for what's happening. - You're both going to hell. - No! Look, look. We got an empty church and a series of alleged miracles. So I don't think it's crazy to ask who stands to benefit. God. - Carter, you're way off base this time. - I hope so. But before reverend Harper took up theology, she used to be a physicist. - You still think I'm going to hell? - Probably. - I think you're jumping to conclusions. - Okay, bottom line: if she's responsible, we're in for a lot more. Yeah, like, a plague of locusts, or fiery hail, or total darkness. You had to say it. Welcome to the end of the world, Sheriff. Not if I can help it. Thanks... Hi, Reverend. Sheriff... Welcome. - We need to talk to you for a sec. - Actually, he wants to talk to you. - Thanks for the support. - You're welcome. - What is it? - Well... Obviously, a lot of strange things have been happening. One might say... Religious things. - Some might... Not me. - Or me. I'm trying to work here, guys. What's your point, Sheriff? I was wondering... and forgive this... Who would stand to gain the most by... the sudden appearance of apocalyptic-type signs? All of us, I would think. Or maybe someone who's been preaching to an empty church every sunday. You do have a point. - Really? - Sure. But whatever's happening, divine or not, I had nothing to do with it. And as much as I would love to believe that, you had the motive and the knowledge to pull it off. We know about your background in physics. Theoretical physics, yes. But there's a reason why I left research for the clergy, Sheriff. I... wasn't much of a scientist. But I am a very good preacher. Well, we're still gonna have to ask you in for questioning. Just relax. What's that? How do you have music during a blackout? It's a crystal radio system, powered by piezoelectricity. Crystal... Radios... Henry, could radios be responsible for what's been happening? Radio waves, at the exact right frequency... Yes. - They might caused the interference. - Can we test for that? Reverend, we're gonna have to borrow that receiver. If this is happening all over town, how come we haven't heard it sooner? Well, let's see. Sound waves can carry infrasonic frequencies that occur outside the range of human hearing. And this crystalline glass is the same as we found in all three places. And... Seth's aquarium is made of the same stuff? Yes... Microorganisms in the water were sonically agitated, - creating a red tide effect. - Okay, what about Zoe? Human tissues have the capacity to transduce pressure from sound waves. Infrasonic frequencies may be putting pressure on her vocal cords. So Allison is-- Sonoluminescence. Sound waves reacting with water... causing objects to glow. So who could pull this off? Anyone with a background in acoustics and infrasonic research. - I'm gonna make a list. - Diane Lancaster is the head of acoustic engineering here at GD. I just spoke to her. She's... the music director at the church. Here's the latest test results on Allison Blake, Doctor. I'm sorry, Dr. Stark. All right, what do I do? You've done all you can. No. Alright, is that fireflies? Bioluminescent fireflies. This must be the place. Her husband died a few months ago. She's... been working at home ever since. Working on what? - And that would be? - A temporal rift. Or a portal to heaven. No! Don't you come any closer! - She wants to cross over. - Into what? Eternity. What you're thinking about seems pretty permanent. You wanna talk about it? There's nothing to talk about. You don't understand. I have found where everything meets. The place where different points in dimensional space-time converge. Where Daniel is waiting for me. Okay, let's... Stick a pin in that. - Okay, that can't be heaven? - Why not? I mean, if she's really discovered a... a gateway to the multiverse. - Not helping. - I have faith that it is. Revelations, chapter four, verse one: "After this, I looked, and behold a door was opened in Heaven." You understand, don't you, Henry? Mom? Mom's sick, Kev. And I can't help her. But you're special, Kevin. Maybe you can. Do you realize what you're about to do? I'm going to see my husband again. He's gone, Diane. And we need you here. There's a lot of people suffering out there because of your machine. And your knowledge might be able to save them. You gonna... Walk away from that? - You just gonna let 'em die? - No! Is that what Daniel would want? I didn't mean to cause all these problems. I just... Wanna be with him again. And you will. You just have to have a little faith. Jack, what if... What if this really is what she thinks it is? I mean, Kim could be... You gotta turn it off. I'm turning it off. Dad? Oh, thank God. Are you really gonna make me beg? - You're here. - Yeah, well... I had to see if you were lying about all the babes who go to church. And you definitely were not. So... How are you? I'm miserable. But I'm here. Have faith. We'll see them again. I promise. I know we will, Henry. It means a lot to me that you came, Nathan. Anything for you. You saved my life. It wasn't me. And it wasn't shutting down Diane's machine, either. What do you mean? He controls the field now, Allie. He's evolving. Reverend... For the record, I'm really glad that I was wrong. So we'll see you next sunday, then? It's a tough one. The Dodgers are playing the Mets. So... Have a slice of pepperoni for me. That I can do. Thanks. See ya. Hang on for a second. 'Scuse me. - Sheriff. - Hey, Henry. I borrowed this book from you. I just wanted to return it. I don't remember that, but, I hope you enjoyed it. Yeah. I mean, it really opened my eyes. As all good books should do. - Yeah, Henry... - Yeah? You're my best friend, you know. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Is it a sin that my favorite part was the music? Well... You stayed awake, right? You hear the guy snoring behind us? - Like a chainsaw. - Yeah. So, Dad... You know my rose tattoo? It's fake. - It's fake? - Yes. But since you seemed okay with it, I can get a real one now, right? - Yeah. - Really?
