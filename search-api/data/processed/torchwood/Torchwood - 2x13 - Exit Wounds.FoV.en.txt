Fighting for the future on behalf of the human race. The 21st century is when everything changes and Torchwood is ready. The explosive devices... Snap! Jack, who's done this? Captain John Hart. Jack, what does he want? Say hi to the family. No, it can't be. Been a while since you've seen your brother, eh, Jack? Gray? Bastard John's taken our SUV. He's driven it back to Torchwood. I'm getting readings of rift activity all over the city. Major rift flares at St Helen's Hospital, the Police Headquarters and the Central IT Server Station. Hey, Andy? Gwen, you've gotta get here right now! I'm serious, we need you. OK, I'm on my way, all right? This is him, isn't it? This Captain John, or whatever. Rhys, drop Owen at the hospital. Tosh, Ianto cover the central server building. Gwen, the police station. Then take me to Torchwood. - Will we all fit? - Yeah, we have to. These are traps. So be careful. You know what he's capable of. What about you? I'm gonna go reason with him! He just tried to kill us. I was the only one who could ever control him. That's why the Time Agency partnered us. Did you just say Time Agency? Don't tell me that's based in Cardiff too? Why's he doing this? What does he want? That's what I'm going to go ask. "I Lost My Heart To A Starship Trooper" by Sarah Brightman</font> Come on! Sing along! It's our song! We don't have a song. And if we did have a song, it wouldn't be THIS song. You're no fun! Thank you. I've been here quite a while, what kept you? We all survived. You know, if you're gonna set an explosion, you need to be more efficient. Oh, them, they were just prototypes, had to test out a theory. How are they all, the little team? What do you want? I want you to know that I love you. Funny way of showing it. No, seriously. You have to understand. I really do love you. Because this... is gonna get nasty. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Learn to put info in English!</font> Torchwood Season02 Episode13 Exit Wounds Cleaned up by aydin1954 - EZTV</font> Cardiff City Police HQ 5:27PM Andy! They just appeared out of nowhere, across the whole building. They weren't human, least not like any human I've ever seen. The station's in shock. Four most senior officers, murdered. Everyone's running round like headless chickens. Rhys, what you doing here? This is a confidential crime scene. If what happened here gets out, there'll be a citywide panic. Rhys won't go blabbing. I'm keeping more secrets than you'd believe. Like what? Like a Time Agency. Based in Cardiff! Oh, it's not based in Cardiff. Brilliant secret - I ask, you tell, well done Bloody hell. What are they? Weevils - they live in the sewers. Tell me you're joking. - Don't mind if I subdue them, do you? - Be my guest. They killed the four most senior officers. Almost like it was targeted. Tosh, report where you are. Just entering the Central Server. {a6}Central Server Building 5:36pm No sign of rift activity yet. This building houses servers for the military, police, NHS, even looks after the server systems for the nuclear station at Turnmill. What problem did they report? Ghosts in these server stacks. How's the arm? Owen gave me industrial strength painkillers, seems to be doing the trick. Ianto. Devils! Blasphemers! Pray to your heathen God. While in the Lord's name, we cast you out! - There we are then. - Sorted. Owen, do you have anything to report? {a6}St.Helen's Hospital 5:39pm We've got some activity in the basement. Coming back from a fag break, saw the door open and there it is! Chewing through the cables. So I locked it in. What the hell is it? Short answer? It's an alien. - Alien? - Yeah. It's called a Hoix. The only profile we have is that it lives to eat. Caught one in Barry last year in a kebab shop, it went through seven doner sticks in 20 minutes. Now, have you got the keys? - What's that? - All species sedative. Now, food. You got anything it can eat? Only these. Right, perfect! Wish me luck. Hoixie, where are you? Come on, porkie. Come out, come out, wherever you are. There you are. Look what I've got. They're actually very tasty. Get a load of one of these. That's it, good boy, come to me. Come on, that's it, try one of these. You really are quite stupid, aren't you? Torchwood Hub 6:03pm ***** ******* ********** Why are you here? Well, see... NOW you're interested in me. It's always the same, nobody cares until you tie them up. Number of reasons, actually. First of all, you were very rude to me. - What? - Very rude indeed. In front of people who barely knew me. You belittled me. Can't let that go. You're serious? Second - you have all of time. Eternity, essentially. And you still refused to spend time with me. After all we've been through together, after all I've done for you. Where's Gray? What've you done with my brother? You don't realise. Actions, ramifications, ripples in the pond. It's beyond my control. Beyond your control? Please! It is. You need to understand that, so, localise the rift storms, a few short sharp shocks... Don't touch those controls! Oi, I'm working here! If you don't want that again, keep quiet. So, I think we're ready to find a vantage point. Whatever you're planning, we're gonna stop you. OK. Go on, then. Stop me. I hope you can, really. No? All right, let's go get ourselves a good view. City Centre 6:28pm What the hell are we doing here? This is a good view. I told you, no struggling. I can make things right with you. You don't understand. You can't ever make this right. Attention... Torchwood employees! Evening all! - Now, stop what you're doing. - Jack, are you OK? Jack can't come to the comms right now. But if you leave a message, I'll be sure and pass it along. What've you done to him? No, no, wrong question. You should be asking, what am I about to do to you? - Put Jack on right now! - Eye Candy! That was so masterful, so bossy, so basically powerless. Get up to the roofs of your buildings. Quickly now, spit spot. - Why? - Owen! Cos if you don't, ' you'll miss all the fun. Hold on a minute, do I mean fun or do I mean carnage? I get them confused. Are you running yet? No dawdling now! Gwen! Where's she going? What're you doing? I'm sorry. Now...Cardiff! Isn't it pretty? Doesn't it twinkle so? Take a good look. Remember this... because it all goes so quick. Oh, my God... Gwen? Oh, God... You've destroyed the city. Jack, hold me. Oh, my God What do we do, what do we do? OK, keep everyone calm, tell them to get every officer in. RUN! What've you done? It's OK. It's all gonna be OK. Stop! Get off me! Jack? Jack?Jack, can you hear me? Are you there? Jack! I'm detecting a huge rift flare over at the castle. It's been generated by the rift manipulator at Torchwood. Tosh, Ianto, Owen... are you OK? Yeah, we're fine. - Still here. - Me too. Good, OK, good. Tosh, do we have the scale of the damage on the city? Fifteen major explosions, at strategic points across the city. There's currently a surge in traffic trying to leave the city but the explosions have cut off all major routes in and out. Landlines, mobile phones and IT networks all down, TV and radio off air. - He's completely crippled us. - Shit. Not wanting to be the harbinger of doom but the systems which serve the nuclear plant have all gone off-line. Tosh, Ianto, you have to stabilise the nuclear power station, make that a priority. Owen, what's it like at the hospital? Lost all power. The backup generators gave out in the blast. Every single machine in this hospital is down. It's a disaster. OK, all of you, listen to me. We're gonna put this city back together, we're gonna find Jack and we're gonna punish John. Now, I need you to be careful. OK? Where are you, Jack? Where are you? Cardiff 27AD We're safe. Now, before you do anything rash, you have to hear... Take us back now! No way. We have to be this far to escape the trigger signal! What? Look at it! Go on. It's bonded to my skin. I can't get it off.Open it. Ninth generation detonator. You're a walking bomb! Add to that a surveillance circuit, to monitor my every word and action, and he has me doing anything I'm told. Cos if I don't... boom! I'm not my own man. I thought you'd see that. No, you're so self-obsessed you thought I'd want to blow up the stupid city! When I could be experiencing 17 simultaneous pleasures in the Lotus Nebula! just run. Oh, please, that is the oldest trick in the book. Jack? Gray? I never stopped believing. I always knew we'd find each other again. I'm sorry. Sorry's not good enough. Get a shovel. {a6}Cardiff City Police HQ 7:39pm This was a targeted attack, designed to cause maximum panic. Usual emergency procedures won't cover what's happened here. This is where we find out how good we really are. Cover the whole city, knock on doors, check on people, tell people that they are safe and that it is being dealt with. Get out there and do your jobs. Bloody impressive, man. She is that, yeah. Lucky sod. {a6}Central Server Building 8:01pm Go! It won't work! Nothing, sorry. We need to re-start the Turnmill servers. What if you can't? - Then the reactor goes into meltdown. - Then I'm going up there. What? Ianto! Look, if we can't fix the remote servers, there must be something I can do on-site to prevent a meltdown. That could be suicide. Are we gonna discuss it, or are we gonna do it? OK, but we both go. I looked for you. I searched for you for years. You were my first thought, every day. What are you expecting, mm? A loving reunion? Absolution? Me to say, "It's OK, brother, "I forgive you." Take Gray and keep him safe. I got to go get your mother. RUN! Those creatures, they lived to torture. They kept us just on the verge of life. I'd lie there, hemmed in by corpses, praying to become one. Because you... let go... of my hand, remember? If I could swap with you, I would. Gray. Gray! Where's Gray? Where is he, son? Where is he? Gray! - Remember it again. - Gray, where are you? I believed you'd come, but you never did. How long before you gave up, hm? Months? Years?Decades? What do you want from me? I want you to suffer. I want your life. This is Cardiff. 27AD. The city will be built here, over the next 2, 000 years. Your grave will be the city's foundations. Your blessing of life becomes a curse. Each time you revive, with a throatful of earth, each time it chokes you afresh, and you thrash on the edge of death, you think of me. All right, calling a halt now I can't let you do this. - Fill the grave. - No way. Then the detonator on your arm gets activated. What's that? It's, er, sentimental value. Torchwood Vaults 9:07pm Skulking, is it? Still no word from Jack. Hey, it's gonna be fine. What if it's not? What if this is how it all ends? I can't do this, Rhys. I'm not up to it. Rubbish. Those coppers are out there now, because of you. Even if you don't believe in yourself, they did. And I do. You're a bloody hero, Gwen. So you keep going, cos we need you. Will you marry me again? Gwen, I've got a rift alert from inside the Hub, mirroring the pattern from earlier when Jack disappeared. D'you think it could be him? I can't check it out, I've got to get the Turnmill servers back online. Tosh, I can't leave the police station. Yes, you can. If they need you. We'll be fine. Are you sure? I'll see you when it's all over. Go! You took your time. On your knees! Honestly, it's just sex, sex, sex with you people! Now! Hands behind your head! I'm gonna need a really good reason not to shoot you within the next 20 seconds. I know where Jack is. You're lying. He's buried alive, somewhere beneath this city. I came back to help you. You bombed this city! Listen to me! You have to believe me. It's Gray, Jack's brother, that's been doing all this. Don't talk rubbish. He placed a bomb on me, molecularly bonded the detonator to my skin, I had to do what he wanted. Look! He forced me to bury Jack and then he freed me, he told me I could go anywhere I wanted. I could've run, but I chose to come back here. Why should I trust you? They were separated as children. Gray was abducted. When I found him he was chained to the ruins of a city on the Bedlam Outlands... surrounded by corpses. He was the only one left. The creatures had long since gone. Dunno how long he'd been there. He thought I was the rescuing hero. So, it took me too long to realise he'd learned terrible things watching those creatures. He let me trust him... The molecules are unbonding. Just like he promised. Oh, God. See? Free man.Apparently. I didn't have to come back here. I could've run. You find Jack, I'll let you live. - But you'd better be quick. - Fine. Toshiko. I need you to run a trace for an etheric particle signal NME transmitting at 200 betacycles. Gwen, where are you? What's he doing? Where's Jack? Trace that signal, we'll find him. It's OK, Tosh. I've got him covered. Just do as he says. No signals even vaguely resembling that. There must be. That transmitter's guaranteed for five millennia through three permalayers - it has to still be transmitting. If not, we'll never find him. He'll be buried... forever. What the hell is that? Oh, there's weevils loose in the lower corridors. Stay there, stay there. Oh, my God, what's going on, how did they get out? It's Gray. He must be here in the city, he said he was gonna take Jack's life, destroy it from the inside out. A weevil wake-up call could be just the beginning. Owen, Gwen, can you hear me? The streets are flooded with weevils, they came out of nowhere. There's no chance we'll get to the nuclear power station in time. Manual life support, get them round the hospital. Ianto, leave it to me. - I can get there. - How? King of the Weevils, remember? Push, will you! Have none of you ever been in a scrum! Bloody hell, how many were there? It's like Fort Apache the Bronx. Apart from the fact that there are savage aliens and we could all die, it's almost exactly the same, yeah. Thanks for that I am telling you I have run every scan possible, there is no signal traceable. Then try it again, it's got to be there. Oi, I'm talking to you. You know you've got a real pest problem around here. Oh, God, I'm so pleased to see you! Don't start, I'll make things right, Eye Candy. Then start by getting those Weevils down the vaults before they recover. It takes more than a bullet to stop them. - You did what? - Ianto! - I didn't have a choice! - There's always a choice. Can we just get these Weevils into the cells! If we don't find him, I'll kill you. Very slowly. What's happening? Tosh? Tosh! Ianto, my comms are dead. Gwen? I let you go. I gave you one trip, you could have gone anywhere. Question of honour. Gray? You're Gray, right? There's no need for this, we can help you. Just tell us where Jack is. His life's mine now. Where's Jack? What've you done with him? WHAT'VE YOU DONE WITH HIM? Turnmill Nuclear Power Station 9:42pm Get the hell out of here! What the hell are you doing here, more like! The systems going into meltdown. A soldier never leaves her post. Well you can now, OK? I'm with Torchwood and we're dealing with this. What d'you know about nuclear containment structure? Well, I'm presuming if you've run out of power, then the containment structure's over pressurised. The containment spray and cooling systems aren't working so the fuel can't be cooled down, it's overheating. So there'll be a meltdown and radioactive material will be released into the atmosphere. Yeah? - Roughly? - Roughly. And I'm at the eye of the storm. We found you in a 20-foot grave! Freeze me, set the alarm to defrost in 107 years time. I begrudge you everything. Recall signal. Get me out of here, Tosh! Get me out of here! I've died once, I'm not doing it again! Where's Jack? Where's Gwen, Ianto, John? You want to watch the dead man die again? Owen, just stay calm. Why should I do that? Where's the fun in that? I'm gonna rage my way to oblivion. - Please stop. - Why? Give me one good bloody reason why - one good reason why I shouldn't keep screaming. Because you're breaking my heart. I'm sorry. It's my fault. No, no, no, it isn't. No, it isn't. Don't you dare go there, Tosh. I'm really sorry. What's gonna happen to me, Tosh? I can't. Please. OK, I need to know. The containment chamber will be flooded with the irradiated coolant. Ah, my body will slowly decompose, as I watch. I should've been able to stop it. Oh, come on, Tosh. There's no way you could've anticipated that power spike, come on. Besides, you've saved my back so many times in the past. Right from the moment I joined. Your second week I had to cover for you, pretend I was a medic, cos you were hung over and unreachable. What was it, Space Pig? - Space Pig. - Yeah. We never did get that date, did we, you and me? We sort of, er, missed each other. It was my fault. I didn't... notice until it was too late. I'm sorry. Me too. COOLANT VENTING IN PROGRESS It's starting. Owen... It's all right. Really, Tosh. It's all right. 'Oh, God. Owen... Owen... Toshiko? Toshiko? Gwen, I need help down here! The nuclear plant at Turnmill. Owen's there. Sealed in. Re-routed the blast. I couldn't save him. Tosh? There you go, darling. Talk to me now, come on. Tosh! And Cardiff city centre is today recovering from a series of devastating explosions. City leaders say it's too early to account for the full scale of the damage that also saw sightings of vicious animals on the streets of the city. My whole life I was looking for him. Now I have to lose him all over again. You cryo-freeze him and then what? Wake him up in a 100 years and he's miraculously better? Cos that's not gonna happen. Maybe killing him would be the release he needs. There has been enough death. You didn't struggle... when I buried you. Like... you were allowing it. It was my penance. It's not your fault. Need help with those rift predictions? Lot of this planet I haven't seen. You like it so much, thought I might take a look. Maybe see you around. I'm sorry for your losses. Final logout procedure DR OWEN HAPPER Final logout procedure TOSHIKO SATO OK. So... if you're seeing this, I guess it means, I'm... well, dead. Hope it was impressive! Not crossing the road or an incident with a toaster. I just wanted to say... it's OK. It really is. Jack, you saved me. You showed me all the wonders of the universe and... all those possibilities. And I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Thank you. And Owen, you never knew. I love you. All of you. And... I hope I did good. Now we carry on. I don't think I can, not after this. You can. We all can. The end is where we start from. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- LEARN QUALITY CONTROL!!</font> Torchwood
