It was a hit-and-run, Henry. Hey, don't do anything stupid. It's a little late for that. Won't your dad work on her face? Won't he help us? 15-blade. I have a yip. You operated on a patient knowing it'd affect your performance? What was I supposed to do? If I can't operate, we can't operate. Oh, yeah. Slow it down. That's right. Now use both hands. And don't be afraid to use that either, sweetheart. I don't usually get so many notes during a performance. - Am I not... - Amazing. Absolutely. It might help more if you paid me a little attention first. First come, first served. Why didn't you say so? Saddle up. Oh, my God! You like that, don't you? Down? Sweetheart, I can't go down any further than I already am. No. Down. I'm super allergic to... The gall of her lawyer to say the morphine made her do it. Libby Zucker blew her best friend's head off out of revenge. Pure and simple. What's not simple is the week we have to spend in court to clear up her mess. What happened to you? Husband come home early from work? The model that was sitting on my face this morning sneezed... and jammed her pussy... Christian! With a mouth like that, she could've done us a favor and broken his jaw. I thought finally we had something in common. Isn't this what happened to your nose? Where are you headed? I got an operation at 9:00. See you after surgery. I'm fine. I haven't had a single tremor in 10 days. The neurologist verified it was a symptom of psychosis triggered by anxiety. Not surprisingly, now that my mother-in-law's face-lift is over... so is the anxiety. Welcome back, partner. Can I... Can I get a second opinion? Up until now, the worst thing that's happened to this face is a rough exfoliate. I never even had a pimple as a kid. Doesn't look like your orbits are involved. Maybe just a deviated septum along with a fractured nasal bone. I'll reset it after surgery. You'll be fine. Fine? This face? No. You gotta make it what it was before, Sean: perfect. I only do perfect. Remember? Holy Mother of God, it's the steatoma from hell. That he couldn't afford to have it removed, even at this stage... We're doing him pro bono. You ever lance one this big? In a nightmare, once. The quicker we get Elephant Man out of here... the quicker you can fix my nose. Oh, my God! He hit a pumper. Vascular clamp. He's tacking. He's losing pressure, Sean. I got it. You got it? Got it. I need a 5-0 Prolene. What the hell just happened, Sean? Tell me what you don't like about yourself. If I'm gonna work on your nose... I want to follow the same procedure as for all our patients. We're not here to talk about my nose, Sean. We're here to talk about what happened at surgery. Nothing happened. It was a minor mishap. You call that river of blood "minor"? Unger bucked from a bad anesthesia reaction. It's happened before. - Your hand palsied again. - No, it didn't. Bullshit! Your problem is getting worse. - It's not getting worse. - So there is a problem. Surgery is our livelihood, Christian. Do you really think I'd hide something from you serious enough to destroy it? Let me take a look again. Don't. It hurts. That's all. You don't trust me to reset your nose. It's just a hairline fracture. Surgery might be unnecessary. What about your burning need for perfection? You're always saying that plastic surgeons can't look worse than their patients. I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks. What I care about is what you're gonna say to Unger when he wakes up. What's up? Matt McNamara? I'm Det. Collins. This is Det. Volpey from Miami-Dade. Are you aware that your friend, Henry Shapiro, was arrested last night? Henry? No, why? Your name came up relating to a crime involving Cara Fitzgerald. We need you to answer some questions. Two days ago, Henry attacked and sexually assaulted Cara... on her way home from school. She's in the hospital in serious condition. Henry's being held, pending charges. Oh, my God. That's terrible. I had no idea. So that's your official story, Matt? You don't know anything about what happened to Cara Fitzgerald? No. Here's our contact information. You can call us at any time. You don't wanna lie to the police, Matt. If we find out there's more to this story... you could wind up in jail right along with Henry. How do you improve on that? There are ways, believe me. Can I ask how you... Bedroom acrobatics. - Are you here to get it reset? - No, that's for wimps. I'm here to consult Dr. Jordan about a surgical technique. She's a colleague of mine. Consult? She doesn't know how to operate, or something? Dr. Christian Troy. Calvin Murray. What you here for, Calvin? It's kind of embarrassing. The only thing to be embarrassed about... is not taking advantage of a doctor's free advice. Triple nipple. Very rare. I'm betting you're here because it affects your sex life. If I had one, yeah. I won't take my shirt off at the beach. And you're about to take it off in front of Dr. Jordan? Let a chick in scrubs poke around your chest? Come by my office tomorrow at 9:00. This says 10:00. My waiting room is filled with beautiful women... like the one that just strolled out of here. If we're gonna really fix your problem... I'd like to make a few introductions beforehand. Awesome! Well, thanks, Dr. Troy. My pleasure. I'd leave before she comes, or you may get charged for the visit. Right. Cool. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Great. Dr. Troy. What a surprise! Good to see you, Monica. I couldn't believe it when I saw you on my appointment sheet. - What happened to your nose? - That's why I'm here. I broke it playing a game of hoops with the boys. I'm looking to get a rhinoplasty ASAP. How's your schedule? I don't understand. You're partners with Sean McNamara. Why is he not fixing it for you? The scar is gonna feel tight for a while, but otherwise you're healing nicely. What do you think, Jess? - I kind of miss it. - Miss it? It scared people. It was a part of you. I love you because of your flaws, not despite them. Can I get dressed now, Doc? I gotta get back to work. I'm afraid I can't let you leave just yet, Mr. Unger. There was a small complication during surgery. You lost an excess amount of blood. We need to keep you here for another day of observation. - Liz? - Another day? Only as a precaution. What happened? You husband spasmed during my initial incision. A superficial artery was nicked. I suspect it's because you had an adverse reaction to the anesthesia. I don't understand. I don't feel weak or anything. - I feel fine. - That's what we wanna hear. Sorry to interrupt... but there's a gentleman in the lobby who insists on seeing you. It's about Matt. So what did I do now? Matt, Henry's father came by to see me at the office today. - He told me what happened to Cara. - Why didn't you tell us? I guess I didn't process it yet. Henry's saying you were involved. I didn't rape anybody. That's not what Henry's saying. He told his father you both hit Cara with Henry's car six months ago... and then left the scene. What a guilty person will do to deflect his crime. To lie like that so blatantly! His own father doesn't even believe him. Wasn't that what he told you? In so many words. Henry's father did ask if you'd come in to give a statement to his lawyer. Your side of the story. Are you okay with that? I have to go get Annie. What? Did you have anything to do with that hit-and-run? How could you even ask me that? I did find it odd that you begged me to reconstruct the face of a girl... I wasn't aware you knew prior to the accident. Do you really think I could hide something from you... that could destroy my whole life like that? You know what, Dad, I'll tell my side of the story to Henry's lawyer. I'm sure he'll believe me. Where's your partner? I thought he'd be doing this. I can assure you you're in very good hands. Do you know how Dr. Troy's consult with that other surgeon went? What other surgeon? Dr. Jordan. We met in her office. He was gonna show her how to operate. Can you believe they let incompetent doctors cut into people? We're ready to prep him. Mr. Murray, the ladies will escort you to surgery. We'll begin momentarily. You sure you don't wanna check up on me? Make sure I'm handling everything all right? Just a minute, Sean. We gotta set the record straight. I rechecked my numbers on Unger. Even the BIS showed he was deep. - Maybe you read the monitor wrong. - Machines don't make mistakes, Sean. People do. You're here for prep early. Why didn't you tell me you met our triple nipple at Dr. Jordan's office? You're gonna have her do your rhinoplasty, aren't you? That's right, I am. You caught me red-handed, Sean. I'm cheating on you. This partnership is a goddamn joke. I have one minor mishap after 15 impeccable years of surgery... and suddenly all your trust swirls down the drain. Don't forget whose talent built this business. Your talent? Let's take a look at your record on talent, shall we? You're the one who left the cautery tip in Mrs. Grubman, not me. You're the one who failed the review boards, not me. And you're the one who almost cut off Unger's head the other day. Not me! Is this gonna be pistols at 20 paces, or is someone gonna get to work here? What are you waiting for, Sean? Give me the scalpel. Give me the scalpel, Sean. Now leave. I think you're meant to let a doctor take off your bandages, Mother. I am a doctor, darling. I'm thrilled with the results. Absolutely thrilled. Is it painful? Everything just throbs. Did you drain your fluids today? Sean said... I was going to do that now, if you'd give me a chance. Here, let me help you. Please. Hold up the mirror, will you? What's wrong now? Is this too disturbing for you? What's disturbing me is some news I got the other day about Matt's friend, Henry. He raped a friend of theirs. How old? Sixteen, and so sweet. I don't understand how a boy who was so young and easygoing could... Lose control like that. Do you want my professional opinion? Can't we pretend we're having a conversation... without dragging your credentials into this? I'll tell you exactly why he did it. Children these days are under the same pressure as adults are. Society's constantly pushing them toward perfection. It's the parents' fault, really. All these baby boomers... grew up with high expectations of what life should be.</i> Then they woke up in middle age and became unglued.</i> - What do you mean? - It's called transference. The parents never learned how to deal with their own failures.</i> So they pass their unrealistic expectations on to their kids.</i> They put pressure on them to excel in school and relationships. And it's too much. Do you think Matt feels that way? - I don't think I try to pressure him. - All this is unconscious, Julia. But, yes, I think you do. That's why he's so quiet. He wants to appear in control, even when he's not.</i> You make him sound like he's some sort of ticking time bomb.</i> It's simple psychology, really. If you're in an environment where you feel you can't fail...</i> sooner or later, you'll explode. Okay. I never do two consultations for rhinoplasty. Why can't we schedule and get it over with? Because that's not the way I work, Dr. Troy. Another perfectionist? I thought you might be looking for a little more than a consult. No. I just like to take my time... and be thorough. What is the big deal? You only need to administer a local, reset the fracture, and stabilize it. Maybe you'd like to do this procedure yourself. Could save an awful lot of money. I'm sorry. Rough day at the office. Don't you find that working hard all day can build stress? I know how I like to release that tension. What do you do? How's Thursday for you? That's it? We're done? Unless there's something else you'd like to tell me how to do, yes. Now that you mention it... I haven't had an all-over body mole check in a while. Perhaps you could take a look? Seeing as you're so thorough. Would you like a gown? Actually, Doctor, on occasion, I sunbathe in the buff. A scrotal melanoma is a stain I don't want on this birthday suit. It looks like you've got more than your share down here. Wait another minute. Jesus! What the hell are you doing? No moles. But I'd recommend some lipo for those hips. Are you saying I have love handles? I do not have love handles. Not that it's noticeable to the untrained eye, but to a professional... I am a professional, sweetheart. Don't try and sell me something I don't need. You're 40 years old, Dr. Troy. A few preventative measures now... could help you hold onto your current look for another five years. I'd recommend scheduling lipo and some Restylane... to soften those puppet lines around the mouth during the same appointment. Men half my age want to look as good as this, okay? You're the one who needs the work done, Doctor.</i> Lasik. Hey! I need the number of our insurance adjuster. Did you just have an accident? There was a car blocking my space at work. I backed into it so I could get out. You ran into another car on purpose? I think four times qualifies as "on purpose," yes. Sean, what is going on? Why are you so angry? Because it was my parking space, Julia! I work 70 goddamn hours a week for it! You don't block a man in... when he's working his ass off all day to provide for his family. Honey, it's okay. Could you still love me if I wasn't a surgeon, Julia? If we had to move out of this house? Of course I'd still love you. I can't operate anymore. I'm having a problem with my hand. It shakes every time I pick up a scalpel. A neurological problem? I had Marty Fine check me out last week. It's nothing physical. It's all up here. You mean, it's all psychological. What's the difference? I can't keep my hand steady. The difference is that if it's all psychological... it doesn't have to be permanent. You put yourself under so much pressure all the time to be perfect. I'm surprised something like this hasn't happened sooner. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be perfect. Only if you're willing to fail. I knew you'd finally come. No contact or the visit's over. Got me? This place is crazy, Matt. I'm not gonna make it much longer in here. What are you doing telling people about the accident? I had to. It's the only way I can get out of this place. Henry, you are in here for raping Cara. Admitting you're involved in a hit-and-run against her... isn't gonna set you free. But it'll get me into a hospital. My lawyer says he can plead temporary insanity for the rape... if he can prove I was under emotional duress at the time... which I was, because of what we did. So now you wanna drag me into this just because you snapped? Everything was fine. All you had to do was play cool and stay away from her... and none of this would have happened. You disgust me. How could you rape a girl who was so fragile and naive... - How could you do what you did? - I didn't do anything. You pretended what we did was okay! Doesn't the pressure get to you sometimes, Matt? Aren't you at all haunted by what we did? That's what was so beautiful about Cara. She was so pure. She could never do what we did: leave someone dying in a ditch. I guess I just thought if I could get someone like that to love me... then maybe I wouldn't be a bad person anymore... and God could forgive me for what I did. When she finally said she'd never go out with me... I knew I'd lost my chance for absolution. You take away someone's chance to be saved, Matt... you take away their soul. I know. You're on your own in this, Henry. No, don't go. Please. I'm sorry. You can't leave me in here. They're gonna rape me, Matt. I warned you once, asshole. Please help me, Matt! You have to help me! Tell me how sexy I am. I wanna hear you say it. You're sexy. - You love my body, don't you? - Yes, I wanna touch you. No, here. You like my ass, right? Tell me how much you like my rock-hard ass. Say it. Say it. What the hell do you think I am all of sudden? Right now, I'm imagining you as a brunette plastic surgeon. Is that all I am to you? Just a hole to fill? Get off me. Get off me, you asshole! Christ! When are you gonna get it through your head, Gina?</i> Sex between us is just that: sex. No strings attached. You wanna connect with somebody? Pay a shrink. - I thought I was doing you a favor. - Screw you, Christian. I'd gone nine months without a sexual encounter. I hadn't even masturbated. And then you... You bat your eyes at me, and you talk so nice to me. - I thought this time would be different. - Why would tonight be any different? You're hideous, you know that? And now, in a fit of karma... you're as ugly on the outside as you are on the inside. Christian? In here. How bad is it? See for yourself. Jesus. You need to clean this up. What in the hell were you doing? I managed to make the cut with the 11-blade... but when I reached for the osteotome and set up to break the bridge... guess what happened? You realized how completely ridiculous you were being? My hand started to shake. I was staring at myself in the mirror... and I realized I'm all alone. My nose was bleeding... and the only person that I trusted was myself. I couldn't handle the pressure. I choked. At least you had the sense to stop yourself before you did more harm. Now I understand what you're going through, Sean. That anxiety. If I treated every patient the same way I treated my face... I couldn't manage. But that's what you do, every day. I scheduled myself for surgery tomorrow at 8:00 a. m. - You're gonna fix this properly. - Me? No, I'm not ready for that. - What about your need for... - This is about more than just my face. It's about our future. Sean? Sean? He's prepped and ready for twilight. Place your fat noggin on the pillow for me, sleeping beauty. You look fantastic. Have you lost weight? If you think one lousy compliment's gonna stop me from killing you... after all the shit you've put me through, think again. You're gonna be fine. I know I am. Count backwards from 10 for me. Ten... nine... eight, seven, six... Stop the anesthesia, Liz. I can't do it, Christian. Call Dr. Jordan. I'm sorry. Tell you what, if I think you're not doing a good job... I'll stop you myself. Fair enough? What are you talking about? Let's pack my nose. Numb it with 10 cc's of lidocaine. And hold a mirror in front of my face so I can see what's going on. I don't want Dr. Jordan, Sean. I trust you. I'll stay awake the whole time. We'll do it together. Are you crazy? I'm not performing a rhinoplasty on an unanesthetized patient. Not alone, you're not. I'll assist. I tried it alone myself. Didn't work for me, either. I think we both work better as a team. Liz. 15-blade. I need to reset the septum before I can properly set it straight. Even with a local, you'll feel the bone break. Let me give you some Versed, just to relax you. And miss all the fun? No way. Chisel. Liz, you wanna hold his head? Hammer. You're doing great. Don't even think about it. You've done a thousand nose jobs before. And you are gonna do a thousand more. Breathe. That's good. Breathe. All right, ladies. Let's stitch him up and wheel him off to Recovery. Thank you. Thank you. You wanna go over what you're gonna say? Henry's father is already in there. I talked to his attorney again. He told me if the story about the hit-and-run was true... since no one died... the whole case could probably be plea-bargained... Jesus, Dad, who do care more about: me or Henry? That's silly. You're my son, Matt. Right. And Henry was the one who raped Cara. So why are you keen on having me help him get off? - That's not what I'm saying. - Then what is it? You don't trust me. I'm saying I want you to trust me when I tell you... that admitting you've made a mistake is okay. Driving into someone and running away is just a mistake to you? Yes. As a matter of fact, I did the same thing the other day. I used some bad judgment during a time of crisis, and I overreacted. But I took responsibility for it. Relying on another person's faith... when you don't have faith in yourself isn't easy. But you've gotta trust me. What I'm trying to say... is that I love you, Matt. And if I actually admit it, that I ran over someone... and left the scene of the crime... you'd still feel that way? You'd still stand by me? No matter what. We're ready. Present today are Richard Shapiro, Henry's father... Sean McNamara, and his son, Matt McNamara. Matt is here of his own free will... and has agreed to give a deposition relating to a purported crime... that occurred some nine months ago. Matt, at this time, I need to remind you... this is very serious matter. And we'll be going on record as part of this investigation. Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, and nothing but? Yes, sir. Very well, then. First question. Were you in any way, as Henry Shapiro has stated... involved in a hit-and-run accident
