and then, they've gone on to win the nobel? Well, that's what I'm talking about. We are back in black, buddy boy. Nobody we care about is dying and/or incarcerated, right? We're about to head back to our Alma mater and... rub their snotty little noses in it. I'm very excited. Oh, come on. It's not that big a deal. - Oh. Excuse me. Ok. Lizzie? - Yeah? Would you just read this to him, ok? Mr. Humble pie over there? - I certainly shall. - Ok. "Dear. Dr. Mcnamara and Dr. Troy, for 40 years, the university of Miami... has been bestowing the Albert Poland award... to those physicians who have made significant contributions... to their medical profession in their chosen fields." - Significant contributions. - Yes. Yes. But isn't it kind of a lifetime achievement award? I'm 45. These things are supposed to happen when you're 80. What's the matter with this guy? Ever since we met, he's had this dark cloud just hovering over him. Well, the cloud was called reality. We were pre-med students. It was non-stop pressure and misery. And you spent your days just whistling past the graveyard. Want a bite? Sean McNamara, right? Christian Troy. I'm pre-med, too. We're in all the same classes. I don't remember seeing you. Oh, yeah. I have attendance issues. But that is going to change. Sophomore year, and I'm turning over a new leaf. And with that in mind, my roommate just had a breakdown or something, and I've got an extra bed. You want to bunk together? I mean, I figured, since we're in the same classes, we can cram for exams, help each other out with labs. And I suppose the fact that I'm number one in our class... has nothing to do with your request. Of course not. - What number are you? - 42, with a bullet. Solidly in the middle. Oh, sure, now I am. This is just school. It's bullshit. I... am the only guy here who has seen the future of medicine. Don't you get it? This... is the new ideal... Barbie dolls, plasticized, flawless women, and... it is catching on with men, too. - Plastic surgery. - The way of the future. It sounds like meaningful work. Oh, what, slaving away for some insurance company for pennies... while you grab some old guy's balls and say "cough" is your dream? No, but saving lives is. Making a difference with my work. You might want to consider a different major. And what would you suggest? Do they offer courses in used car sales? How did I get him to room with me? I blew him! Seriously, you know me. I didn't take no for an answer, eh? You know what? He harassed me. Eventually, I agreed just to shut him up. And the rest... the rest is history, right? To another 25. Hear, hear. Hear, hear. Cheers. Nip/Subs Team presents Season 7 - Episode 1 "Dan Daly" Original VO: honeybunny Original VO corrected by chamallow35 Corrections & Resynchro VO : Sean Tell us what you don't like about yourself, Mr. Daly. Go to hell, dickhead. Dan. He didn't mean to be condescending. It's just... - our way of... - You too, shitface. Uh-oh. Sorry. You can't say that to the doctors. The insults are just his way of showing his admiration. It's part of the condition I mentioned on the phone. Oh, yeah. Uh, lesch-nyhan syndrome. Had you heard of it before? We did some research. A rare genetic disorder characterized by an excess of uric acid in the blood. Affecting the area of the brain that governs impulse control. Beside from the muscle spasms, the effects can often turn emotions into opposing impulses. Love is hate, elation can become misery, and admiration comes out as... "Go to hell." In that case, we understand, and it's a pleasure to meet you too, Mr. Daly. Can I see that... thing on your desk? You mean this? I want it. I really want it. Sure. You can have it... I should have warned you... self-mutilation is a primary manifestation of the disorder. You probably noticed that with his lips already. He chewed them off. Asshole. Oh, no. It's why having a full-time person to watch over him is essential... which is... not without its risks. I... I don't want to hurt him, but I... I can't stop myself, even... when I... try. It's just like with my hands. What happened to your hands? It started when I was a kid. They would just make me so angry. I had to have them gone. I didn't even care about the hurt. I would have lost them all... if my mother hadn't figured out a... creative way to make me stop. Eventually, they gave up on me. They put me in a home. I've been using assisted living for 30 years. If you hadn't, you would have killed yourself. Most patients do. Life expectancy is 45. And you just turned 46. Yeah. I never thought I'd make it... that long. But I did. I did. Now, if we do fix your lips, how do you know it won't happen again? We don't. What do you mean "we don't", asshole? I'm sorry. It's just... I've been self-destructing my whole life, and despite all the odds, I'm still... here. I think that means that I deserve... a fresh start. Don't you? Breaks my heart, that guy. This is one of those cases, you know? Makes me feel like I actually did something, earned that award. You know what I like about this case? Sooner or later, nychen-schlichen is going to bite those lips off again, and, well, there's another 15 grand from his trust fund in our pockets. Do you have any ideals anymore? Any desire to heal or help? I'm just asking. Seanie, I was always a pragmatist and a businessman, huh? Did you ever hear me say I wanted to save the world, hmm? All I wanted was perks and a glamorous lifestyle. And you are never going to guilt me or change me. Don't you know that by now? I think I live in a kind of denial about it. Oh, come on. Lighten up. We're on the verge of a great future here, my friend. You're going to love the marble I picked out for the retaining wall... in the new recovery suite. It is the perfect spot... to showcase the Albert Poland award. Oh. There you are, Christian. - Put your eyes on this. - Oh my... Would you look at this? It's so smooth, huh? And decadent. Isn't it great, huh? What do you think, Sean? - How much is it? - 1,500. I love it. Well, that's pretty good for the whole wall. A square foot. It's chinchilla mink marble. Forget it. I agreed to this because I thought a better, state-of-the-art recovery suite was a good idea. But all this stuff... the new lounge, the marble wall dividing the rooms... 10 times more chic than some sloppy dividing curtain, my friend. It's ostentatious. It... is an investment, all right? This is rodeo drive. We need the bling, my friend. I love these colors. For once, I'd like to be ahead of the game financially... instead of always having debts over our heads. And you want to put us back in the hole for a wall... that would serve the same purpose if it was stucco. I wasn't paid to do stucco, Sean. You look cheap, you are cheap. Uh, excuse me, Rebecca... that's your name, right? Um, what's with these skylights? They're half the size that I told you to make them. Hi, hon. Hi. I downsized them. Frankly, Mrs. Troy, They were garish. Oh. Well, they were actually modeled after the ones Christian and I saw... on our honeymoon in provence, so... you need to tear them out and redo them now. No. Just leave them the way they are, ok? It would cost thousands to redo them. Sean, you worry too much. Besides, how can I do the Italian motif in the new bathroom... when I am out here doing these? What new bathroom? Go look at it. It's beautiful. At least, it will be when I'm done decorating it. Sean... Christian, this one is going to be a problem for me. Why don't you just go talk off the ledge, please? Hmm? Huh? Huh? You don't have to worry about Sean, ok? - I'm not. - Good. But I don't care how much you pay me, I can't work with that bitch. Whoa. That bitch is my wife. Which is why you should be thanking me. For what? For waiting for her to leave before I told you that I was pregnant, shitdick. Nice job pulling out. Nice work there, doc, huh? That's why they say you got the, uh, golden hands, huh? They're the same color they were yesterday. Don't believe your own hype. I happen to admire your hands, which is why, of all the surgeons in the country, I'm going to ask you to do my vasectomy. Talk about an unnecessary surgery. Kimber can't even have any kids anymore. But our hot little decorator can. Apparently, I have super sperm. Every time I look at a chick, she gets pregnant. Jesus, Christian. You're about to be given a lifetime achievement award. Could you possibly just grow up? We have made it, Sean. The Gate to the garden of earthly delights is wide open for us now. You think I'm going to say no to all that sweet nectar... because of a silly little thing like pollination? No. What about a little thing called marriage? You're unbelievable. Oh, come on. Swelling looks good. Blood flow's returning. No sign of an infection. I think you're going to like it. Here. Just hold this. So what do you think? Yeah. They're going to be a little tender at first, but there are some exercises you can do to help break them in. Try saying "sea shell" for me. See sell. Good. Basketball. Uh, asket all. Uh-huh. Now, this one's a little bit harder. Ping pong. Huh... f-f-fu... ping. Ff-ff... Keep trying. No. F-fen... fen... fen too close. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. What's going on? The hell? We were just talking, and then the next thing I know... Jesus. Why doesn't he have his restraints on? I let him loose just for a second. You let him loose? Why? Well, he seemed... I don't know... better. Better? He's got a genetic disease, Sean. What do you think, 'cause you fix his lips, he's normal again? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. You can't blame this on him. I'm sorry. - You ok? - Yeah. I'm sorry. Come on. Let's get you some stitches. Next time you're being chased... through campus by an angry professor, wear pants. How could i? I think his wife broke the zipper when she bit them off me. I'm just lucky that guy's so damn slow. Hey, this isn't my fault, Sean. I just went over there to talk my "d" up to a "c"... on that cellular physiology exam. Yeah? Well, how does that lead to you screwing his wife? He wasn't home. Oh, hey, Sean, I need to borrow your notes... on that cellular physiology term paper. I'm already stuck with a "d" now on the exam. I got to kill on that paper. What's in it for me? You know that blonde that you've been eying? Julia? I know her. I can introduce you. Did you sleep with her? Not yet. All right. Fine. But you have to talk me up to her. No problem. I'm a born liar. Ok. All right. How am I doing down there? Am I fixed yet? Almost. Just finishing up the keyhole. You're lucky, you know. These hemostat vasectomies are far less painful. What's a little pain exchange for a lifetime of free love? Yeah. That's exactly what you need, even fewer reasons to control yourself. Well, congratulations. You are now medically prevented from producing unwanted children. Oh. Great. 3's my limit. What are you going to do about, um... - What? - Rebecca? Yeah, well, she got rid of it. Don't worry. What are you guys doing in here? Hmm? What are you doing in here? Nothing. Sean was just... burning off some genital warts, that's all. Well, I'm sure your wife will be pleased about that. She's in your office. Shit. She can't see me like this. You need to cover for me. But... What do you want me to tell her? I don't know. Tell her I'm with a patient or something. I mean, you know... just... she finds out I've had a vasectomy, she'll... kill me. What are you going to do when it all catches up with you? I've paid my penance, Sean, all right? Foster care, breast cancer, all the bullshit I've had to put up with you for I don't know how long. Just cover for me, please. Hey, Sean. Kimber. Um... uh... Christian is just... he's finishing up with a patient, so, um... how are you? - God, you look fantastic. - Yeah ? Marriage obviously agrees with you. Thank you. Who would have ever thought we'd be an old married couple? So, how's the decorating thing going? You know, I don't think we've had a chance to talk since the wedding. You know, actually, it's going really good. I have a lot of really good ideas. I think I have a natural gift, or at least my teachers think so. Well. What... what do you think of that new marble wall? It's, uh... really Christian's thing. Yeah. He always has to do what that fat, untalented woman says every time, doesn't he? She's emperor's new clothes, if you ask me. Well, she does come highly recommended, and... you know how Christian is about people and their... credentials. What do you think if we put some food coloring in here, make the tank prettier... like, maybe an aquamarine... make the room pop? Bet that would kill the fish, Kimber. He's screwing her, isn't he? Wh... who? I'm not stupid. Christian. Rebecca. They're having an affair. Oh... you know, he has turned a corner. He wants it to work with you. And I think he's had his fill of all that. Ok. So tell me what you know, tell me now, and don't lie to me. Kimber... Does he have... random Christian-like thoughts? Yeah. I'm sure he does. But the bottom line is that... he loves you, and he is faithful... to you. And you can trust him. Well, you know that's why I came here today, right? To make him tell me the truth. So, thank you. Thanks for being honest with me, Sean. You have no idea how relieved I am now. Ahh, thank you. Mmm. You've had enough, Sean. You're damn right, I've had enough. He doesn't need this. Thank you very much. Miss, don't believe a word that comes out of this man's mouth, ok? He'll tell you anything you want to hear, and none of it's true. Just ask his wife. Look, I'm sorry if I put you in an uncomfortable position... - Uncomfortable position? - Yes, uncomfortable position. Oh, come on. You wouldn't care if I squatted on glass, as long as your ass is covered. Nothing's changed in 25 years. You know, maybe you can't help lying and cheating. Maybe it's a genetic trait like lesch-nyhan. And you can't evolve into a decent human being... 'cause it's not in your DNA. Excuse me, honey, get another one? And can I get some ice? My balls. I had the ol' snippety-snip. I want to make sure I don't swell during the flight. Thank God. I almost missed it. You have a much more interesting job. Now, what kind of chocolate do you sell? I'll give you a sample. - Oh, you have some here? - Mm-hmm. Great. Yeah. Well, let's see. For you... Ok. This... is made from criollo cacao, grown in Nicaragua. Oh, I love how you say that. It has higher levels of phentolamine... Mmm. Which, besides its decadent taste, is known to have a slightly psychotropic effect. Oh, it is so delicious. You want another? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'll split it with you. - Wow. - Mmm. You know, I need to use the bathroom. You want to come? You saying you want to join the mile high club? Give me 2 minutes. Ok. Don't do it. - Like you wouldn't. - I have. It's not worth it, all right? The bathrooms are too small to get any rhythm going, and... flight attendants are very strict post-9/11. I tell you what, Buddy boy. Why don't you cover for me? See how it feels for a change. Don't say I didn't warn you. Oh, God! Oh, God. Don't stop. Ahh. Don't stop. Ahh! Ahh! Excuse me? Open this door. You need to come out of there. Come out of there now, or the captain will land this plane. U.s. Marshal. Wait. Wait. Wait. U.s. Marshal. - Are you armed? - No. You are being detained under the u.s. Anti-terrorism... provision of the patriot act for disobeying a flight crew... while in the air. I have the authority to handcuff to your seat if I deem it necessary. Stay seated till we land in Miami, at which time you will be questioned by homeland security. - Do you understand? - Yeah. Yes. - Shut up. - It's all right, Buddy. Just shut up. Why is it you never get caught, and whenever I break the rules... 'cause you, my friend, are an amateur. Thank you so much. You can't expect to play like Tiger Woods if you don't practice. Thanks for doing nothing, by the way. Think of all the times I covered for you. If she hadn't convinced them... that I was giving her the heimlich maneuver, I'd still be in custody. You know what? You need to put that all behind you. Suck it all in. Take a look around. Can you feel it? - Respect? - Envy. Nothing says success more than the jealousy of your peers. - Dr. Troy? - Yes? Do you mind if I steal you for a moment? I promised Candace Delaureo I would bring you over the moment you arrived. Apparently, you made quite an impression on her... when you were a student. Sweetie, do you mind? Hey, could I just get a cup of coffee? How do you take it? Black, as I recall from the all-nighters we used to pull. Curtis? Older, wiser. Eh. Mostly older. Oh, my God. Hey! - How you doing, Buddy? - I'm good. How are you? - Congratulations, McNamara. - Oh, thank you. A beer, please. I got to tell you, I was a little shocked when I heard you won the Poland award. You must do one hell of a tit job. Well, we do a little more than tit jobs. I'm just teasing you. Relax, Sean. You never could take a joke, yeah? Well, I'm not surprised you're receiving it. Work you've been doing, treating fevers in Angola and Pakistan is pretty incredible. Oh, thanks, Buddy. We're lucky, though, you know, Sean? Most poor bastards, they never get to find out what their true purpose in life is, eh? So, uh, so how's Julia? - She's good. - Yeah? We divorced. Oh. Gee. I'm sorry about that. - You have kids? - Yeah. Yeah. 3. Oh! There. - There's Matt. - Uh-huh. That's conor there, and there's Annie. - Wow, good-looking. - Yeah. - You must be really proud. - I am. What, so the oldest one's probably in college, right? Uh, well, he's... he's just taking a break. Ah. Smart. Smart. Let me show you my crew here. This is Luke and Andrea. Luke is at the old Alma mater following in his dad's footsteps. Oh, great. But Andrea, she's a rebel. Nothing but trouble. Heh. I got one of those, too. Just had to be different, you know? Yale. I swear she did it to break my heart. Well, we can't all go to Harvard, can we? Well, some of us could but didn't. I never understood that, Sean. What's this? Ohh. Harvard. Congratulations. While you're both freezing your balls off in the frigid northeast, I will be on the beach licking salt off of the hot bodies of my fellow interns. I'll meet you after biochem. We still need to discuss housing. See you, Troy. Guy's a fag. Guy's a genius. So, you really want to go to school... with a bunch of overachieving grade-grubbers? As opposed to a bunch of oversexed tit-grabbers? I just don't want to see you turn into a grind. You have that potential, Buddy boy. Trust me. Hey, um, there are direct flights from Miami to Boston, you know? Yeah. I just... I thought we were going to be in this together. So we going to do this thing together or what? Come on. I got a surprise. - Sure this is it? - Yes. Yes. I'm sure this is it. Oh, my God. Third floor, room number 12. The original home of McNamara/Troy. Can you believe it? Look. It's been painted a couple of times, and... the cupboard used to be over there. The carpet's been replaced. They didn't get rid of that bong water stench. No, they didn't! Isn't that great, huh? I love it! It's great! You know how many hours we spent studying in this room? Do you remember this bed, huh? It's the first time I ever had a threesome. I remember. I had midterms the next morning. Oh. Hold on. - Oh, my God. - No. Yeah. It's still here. It's still here! Come and check it out. - The scoreboard! - Oh, the scoreboard! Ahh! The scoreboard! 209 of Miami's finest coeds represented right here. Of course, you know, if I banged them at their place, I didn't notch it down on there, so... - Yeah. - There's a lot more. Ok. Let's go grab some dinner. Go? What? What are you talking about? We're sleeping here tonight. I already paid the schlubs who room here so that we could stay. - Sleep here? - Yes, sleep here. Relive old times, you know. Like, order some pizza and drink some scotch, get a little drunk, right, like we did in senior year. All right? Come on. We're getting a big-ass award tomorrow. We should at least relive some of the good old days, you know? The things that kind of got us here. I mean... I don't know. Maybe you're right. It could be fun. Could be fun? I mean, come on! This is great, huh? Come on. Let's play darts. You're not going to fit in that bed. You know, the showers still have that... Whoa, ho, ho. Hey, Buddy boy. Look who I found while you were taking a shower. Winona and... Ryder. Come on, man. We just started a game of strip poker. Here, join us. Oh, hold on, ladies. Yeah. You know what that means? Yeah, both of you, get going. Seanie, you enjoying yourself? Partner? I think it's your turn. They're barely old enough to have their driver's licenses. They're 18. I carded them. I'm going for a walk. I thought he wanted to be more impulsive. I really didn't expect this out of you, Mr. Mcnamara. The entire semester, you've been a model student... an "a" on your midterm, an "a" on your lab work. Now, I wonder if you cheated on them, too. Just give me another chance, professor Silvestre. I'll do anything. I know this stuff. Test me right now. Ah, it's too late for that, Sean. But I'm supposed to go to Harvard in the fall. If you flunk me, I won't get in. You know that. You should have thought of that before you and Mr. Troy... handed in the exact same final papers. I'm failing both of you. Mcnamara/Troy has set new standards for reconstructive surgery, repeatedly doing procedures once thought impossible. They pioneered the first face transplant procedure in 2005... Don't say anything undignified about playing strip poker... with 2 freshmen the night before the Poland award? Dignity is overrated, my friend. The freshmen, on the other hand, are not. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to present the 2010 Albert Poland award to... doctors Sean McNamara and Christian Troy. Thank you. Whoa. Lucky she didn't drop it, huh? Uh, greatly honored to receive this award. It's really... quite daunting. However, I wouldn't be up here if it weren't for... one particular man, Sean McNamara. This man right here is the real talent at McNamara/Troy... and always has been. You... are the man. Even when we were at school here, every day... and everybody knew that Sean was born to be a physician, and as I watched him grow over the years and become a master, I could only hope that some of that... extraordinary talent would rub off on me. Not too sure any of it has, but... I guess, at the end of the day, my biggest contribution... to our practice is letting the world in on... his gifts and his talent. And I look forward to enjoying the view from his coattails for... many, many years to come. We are both humbled and grateful... for the jury's selection, and we will strive to... remain worthy of its honor, if we can. Thank you... Thank you very much. Hey, dude. Look sharp. Someone's here to meet you. Julia Noughton, meet Sean McNamara, the best-looking, smartest, most all-around awesome guy on campus. Wow. You certainly have a friend in Christian, Sean. Very nice to meet you, Julia. Thanks for the kind words, Christian. Just telling it like it is, partner. Thank you. Oh. Thank you so much. - It's unbelievable, huh? - I know. What'd you think of the speech huh? I was a little nervous, but... Oh, it was something. So I didn't suck? Hey, thank you. All right. Congratulations. Did you mean everything you said? Thank you. Um, Dr. Troy? Dr. Mcnamara? - Yes? - Can we get a picture together? - Yeah. - Thank you. Yeah. Of course. For the cover of the alumni report. Ahh, the cover. I like the sound of that. Can we get a couple of copies for the waiting room? Are you kidding me? That's the least we can do. Your donation was above and beyond anything we ever expected. What donation? Yeah, especially this year, with the economy where it is. I'm just glad we had something to offer in return. Well, this is fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. Both of you. Very much. - Good to see you. - Thank you. Take care. Yes. Oh. Thank you very much. - Thanks. Thanks. - Thank you, sir. - How much did you give them? - Appreciate it. What's that? - How much did you give them? - A reasonable amount for... a couple of... thank you so much... successful surgeons... thank you. - Thank you. - How much? Thank you. Huh? What does it matter? Tell me how much. 200. Thank you. - Thousand? - Yeah. It's tax-deductible. Thank you. You bought this. I guaranteed us another 20 years in this business, my friend. Thank you so much. Thank you. Untie your panties, ok? This was supposed to be something to make you happy. Oh, yeah. You're always looking out for others, aren't you? How much did Ryerson donate? Ryerson works with kids in Africa. He doesn't have any money. Just the dignity to let his success earn him the honor. Not be forced to buy it. Which makes this thing just a complete joke and a waste of time, just like everything with you. Sean, would you come back here, please? Come on. You can't do this. Watch me. All right. I should have told you. This is bullshit. I said you could look at my notes, and you copied my goddamn paper word for word. You knew what was going to happen. You know, I should have known better. When you came into the library that day, I knew you were trouble. I should have seen this coming. I should have known that getting the Poland for plastic surgery... was a farce. It's not a farce. We did good work, and we're being recognized for it. - That's the truth. - The truth is, you paid for it. and I should thank you... because you finally did something so asinine... that I can see what my problem's been all along... listening to you. Oh, give me a break. Meeting me is the best thing that's ever going to happen to you, and I think deep down inside, you know that. It's because of you I'm not going to Harvard. Harvard is overrated, Sean. You ruined my life. For God's sake, Sean. Grow up. The only one you have to blame for your life is yourself. You finished? With the hammer or with you? I did it because... I don't know. I wanted you to be happy about the work we've done. I want you to be happy about us. It's not all bad, Sean. Sean. We have a problem. Mr. Daly carved his face off. What an awful disease. Can you imagine doing this to yourself, inflicting such pain? Just sutures? You're not going to fix him up? What's the point? He's just going to do it again. You're just going to give up on him? Big difference between giving up and
