We need to stop doing this. You're not goin' back to him, are you? - He's my husband, Sean. - You deserve better. You'll never make me happy. I can never love you enough. We've hit a rough patch. You don't break up because of it. He's done with me now. Good. He's doin' you a favor, Kimber. It's a gift. Kimber fell off a boat last night. She's missing. Oh, my goodness these are so good. Here. I'll go get you some food, ok? Weather report says it should be clear through the weekend. That'll help. It's been 2 days, Sean. If the coast guard's not givin' up, then we can't either. You want some noodles? Jesus, what are you doing, Matt, feeding the kid Thai food? It's too spicy. What's your problem? Take it easy. Wanna get pissed at someone, be mad at Hamoui. If the police didn't charge him with anything, what the hell am I gonna do? Hello. Hi, Brandie. No, you're at the right place. Ok. See you in a minute. It's Kimber's mom. Have you really never met her? Kimber kicked her out of her life a long time ago, didn't invite her to the wedding, so... What happened between them? "Unresolved issues" is what I heard. Christian. You made it. - Heh. Hi. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. Hi. Hey, didn't you, uh, say you were bringing someone with you... Les is coming tomorrow. He's got business, so... I'm here. Ok. Come in. Wow, this is right on the water. - Brandie, I'm Sean. - Hello, Sean. Hi. I'm a friend of Christian's and your daughter. Hi. Hey. I'm, uh... I'm Matt. You're Matt. So this must be Jenna. Yeah. Wow. This is a lot to take in... son-in-law, a granddaughter, an ex-son-in-law. I wish it could be under different circumstances. Well, the important part is we're all here now. That's right. Hey, little one, you wanna go back and finish coloring? Ok. I was just thinking on the way here that when Kimmy was a little girl, I taught her how to swim in the lake that was near our house, and... she just loved the water so much, you know? She was such a good swimmer. Just... I just hope that everything is gonna be all right. And she's tough. Yeah, she is. That was the coast guard. They're... callin' off the search.

Contactez-nous sur le topic de cet épisode sur le site Jenna, sweetheart, it's time to go. Go? Don't you think it's a little soon to be uprooting her? Uprooting her? I'm her father. Yeah, but come on. Please, act like an adult for once in your life. What, you gonna take her to your shithole? Who's gonna take care of her when you're lookin' for a job? Well, my shithole is a sunny studio is a great old deco building, and I'm actually working right now. Yes, it's as a barista at the coffee mill on hyperion, but it's a job. And FYI., I'm dating the manager. Her name's Ramona. She comes from a huge family, and they all absolutely love my daughter. So when are we gonna meet this Ramona, then? Jenna, honey, Ramona's waiting. She made us some meatball soup. You wanna go? Come on and give me a big, big, big one. And a kiss. I love you. I love you, too. - You be a good girl, ok? - I will. - Ok. - I will see you soon. See you soon. Let's go. Brandie? Sorry. Um, should I... No, no, no. It's not a problem. I was just checkin' if you're ok. I'm ok. I just... I just wish that somehow we could have worked out our differences. She was always so mad at me. I mean, we were more like sisters in a way, because I had her when I was so young. I just didn't... I didn't have a clue. And I tried to reach out to her, but she... didn't want me to be a part of her big, fancy life. Yeah, you can't let... the guilt take over. I know it's hard, but... this isn't about us. It's about Kimber. We need to celebrate her and her life. Yeah. You're right. Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mrs... Carlton, Sheila Carlton. Course, I call her Shu-Shu, but that's because I've been calling her Shu-Shu since we met in middle school, or was it in high school? I don't even remember. It seems like the years have flown by, and I keep calling her Shu-Shu. Well, it says here that the injuries to your face were caused by... me. It was because of me. That's why she's here, because I almost killed her. It wasn't your fault, Jane. Stop blaming yourself. It was Wayne. He's the one who did this to me. He's an animal. Uh, I'm sorry. Wayne is your husband? Her monkey. Chimpanzee. He weighed over 200 pounds. He had a big appetite. Well, I'm gonna have to do a complete workup and talk to the surgeons who treated you after the attack, but I would recommend that you do the reconstructive surgeries in stages. Your body's already been through enough trauma. And it's my fault. Can you imagine being the one to cause your oldest friend such agony? Reminds me of that awful tragedy with Travis in Connecticut a few years back. Jane, please. I shouldn't have let him out of his cage. He seemed unsettled that morning, and I... I should have just... you saved my life, Jane. Now stop it. How did you? I hit him with a frying pan. And when he wouldn't release her, I stabbed him repeatedly with a kitchen knife. I don't know how you can ever forgive me. Why don't I have a nurse escort you to the exam room. You can change, and we can do a thorough exam. I want you to make her as beautiful as she was. I don't care what it costs. - Jane, it's never going to be... - He owes you this. Wayne did some work in movies, uh, television shows. He had such star appeal. He was such a little performer. I never spent a dime of his money. I was saving it for his old age. But I'm spending it now, every cent. And everything I have as well, if I have to. Where is she? - Um, she... - Les. Come here, baby. It's ok. I'm here now. I can't believe it's true. - When'd you hear for sure? - Last night. Is that why you didn't pick me up at the airport? 'Cause that's what we originally planned. Les ? I'm, uh, Christian Troy, Kimber's husband. - The plastic surgeon. - Yes. My deepest condolences. Thank you. Please, uh, forgive me. Was that your Maserati out there? Yeah. Wow. For somebody so concerned about appearances, to drive a foreign car. Pfft. Excuse me? American economy needs our support. Les, this... I own the largest domestic dealership in Wisconsin. All makes. Great deals. You'd be surprised what your money can buy nowadays. - We ship anywhere. - You tryin' to sell me a car? I don't sell cars. I make people happy. Ready to get back to the hotel? Christian invited us to stay here. We were talking about the memorial service... I... I already booked the room for a week, remember, on points. Gotta try that jacuzzi, huh? You don't wanna see her before she puts her face on in the morning anyway. Listen, is there a bathroom around here? I had a couple beers on the plane, and my bladder's... Just back there. Charming. So how long you guys been together? 6 years. We break up. We get back together. We break up again. He can be a lot to handle, but I love him. We have a connection. Well, Kimber and I, we sure had our fair share of ups and downs, you know. I understand exactly what you're talking about. I guess it runs in the family, then. That is such great soap you got in there. I love it. You ready? We'll call you, ok? And don't forget to tell me where you got that soap. Love it. I am so sorry to hear that. Yeah, they were married about a year ago. Christian's taking it pretty hard. Well, well, please, give him my condolences. I just can't imagine what it would be like to lose Sarah. And suicide, jeez. That's difficult. I guess you just... you can't ever know what's goin' on in someone's head, even if you're married to 'em. Right? I think, in a way, we all feel responsible. Aw, how can you not? You know, it's probably not the best time for you to be joining me in Africa, right? Probably not, Curtis. I'm sorry. Ah, I understand. Life gets in the way sometimes. You know, we all have responsibilities. And you can't leave Christian right now. You get back from this trip in, what, 3 weeks? Tell me about the next trip after that. Well, we'll be, uh, building a new hospital in Basra this spring. - I'm in. - What? I've heard that before, you know. No, no, no. It's firm this time. I am in. I'll get the ball rolling while you're in Africa. I won't let this be another Harvard. Cheers. I'll hold you to this one, buddy. Your blood pressure's on the high side. Are you under a lot of stress lately? You could say that. You need to control it. Iraq isn't really relaxing. It's beautiful, yes, but... their work there is really intense. I think it's gonna be very good for me, actually. It's exactly the kind of change I need in my life right now. Well, you couldn't have picked a better organization to work with, help change your life. The savior center is a great place to work. Curtis often says it saves us who work here at least as much as it saves our patients. It's so nice to meet you, Dr. McNamara. I've heard so many good things. Thank you, Mallory. Dr. Kwinda. I'm sorry to say I haven't heard as much about you. That's just as well. We keep very busy around here. Eyes on the prize, so to speak. Are you gonna be helping build the hospital in Basra? I'm afraid not. I'll be here in San Diego with Nsolo, spending most of my time fundraising, unfortunately. Breathe deep, please. Heart rate's a little elevated. But we'll chalk that up to the excitement of a new job. We're all excited about it, frankly. You'll be our first reconstructive surgeon on staff, Dr. McNamara. Often our patients with deformities are ostracized from their villages and their communities. Your work will give them a chance at normalcy again. Would you like your prostate examined? Excuse me? You're 45. You need to check it every year. Better safe than sorry. Oh, no, no, no. That's all right. We should at least be on a first-name basis before we... I know yours, Sean. I'm surprised my husband didn't at least tell you mine. Oh, you're married to Nsolo. No. Curtis is my husband. I'm Sarah. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. What are you doing in this neck of the woods? Well, Les took me shopping at neiman Marcus, and he bought me a dress for the memorial, and I was wondering if you would take a look at it to see if you think Kimber would approve. Wow. That Les, he's got an eye, doesn't he? Managed to pick the one dress in the world that would make you look like a whore. That's not very nice. I'm sorry, but the guy's a tool, and I don't like the way he talks to you. He takes care of me, you know, Christian. I thought women liked a little class. Kimber did. Well, I'm not Kimber. And Kimber was a star even before she became one. I'm just a midwestern nobody. What am I gonna do? I really wanted to make my baby girl proud. I have an idea. I have this laser machine that, uh, tightens the skin through soft-cell coagulation, and there's absolutely no healing time. It's like a high-tech facial. I'd like to talk to Les first. Oh, no, no, no. Trust me. It's exactly what Kimmy would want you to do. - Really? - Yes. Is this gonna hurt? I told you. It's like, uh... it's like getting a facial. I've never had a facial. Never could afford one. Sad, right? So Les always tells me that my skin is dry. Is this gonna help with that? It should. - Yeah? - Yeah. Ok, take a look over here for me. Oh, I'm sorry. Just a sec. I, uh, forgot... I'm sorry I was never good enough for you either. Something wrong? Yeah. It's me. You don't need this, Brandie. You look beautiful just the way you are. Wow. Les doesn't say that to me anymore. I haven't heard that in a long time. I missed it. Thank you. How do you get through something like that and not suffer posttraumatic stress for the rest of your life? What about her friend? Knowing that she was responsible for something like this. It's not like she trained it to be an attack monkey. It's what she's doing that counts, helping her friend deal with it, seeing her through all these surgeries. Maybe, but she's still gonna have to find a way to live with the guilt. I don't envy her. That's great. Yes. Here he is. It's Curtis. Yes, of course I will. You, too, darling. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Curtis sends his regards. What are you doing here, Dr. Kwinda? I gave a talk at USC med, and I thought that rather than face the horrible traffic back to San Diego, I'd see if you were free for dinner. Sure. I... I guess I'm available, yeah. Great. I'd love to hear your ideas on facial reconstruction for patients with neurofibromatosis. Hey. Hey. How'd you get in my house? Cleaning lady. Just came to grab Brandie's makeup bag. Guess, uh, she left it in your bathroom the other day. Is that what you're watchin'? Ok. Confession time. Look, I only found out about Kimber's career from Brandie recently. Being somewhat of an aficionado, I couldn't help myself. So you went snoopin' through my shit. I know. I could have gone on the Internet, but the hotel doesn't have wi-fi. You wanna know somethin' weird? Brandie and Kimber both make that same face when they're takin' it from behind. Buddy, you're talkin' about... you're talkin' about my wife. I... I meant no disrespect. She gave me a chubby. That's the ultimate show of respect, I think. You're lucky I don't throw you off the balcony. Wait. Wait. Wait. I'm sorry. You gotta admit it's the one thing these Henry girls are good at. Figured it'd be a way for us to bond. Please get out of my house. Ah. Got it. You are being too overprotective. Now, friends don't let other friends' wives drive drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm just... relaxed. Bathroom. Right back here. This? Yes, right in there, my dear. There. Just listing a little starboard there, Matey. Believe me, this isn't drunk. That night in Thailand when I had my fifth scorpion whiskey, now, that was drunk. Yeah, the sheets on the bed are actually fresh, as of this morning, so you're in luck. - And where do you sleep? - On the couch. Here. Let me. I had an easier time bivouacking on the side of Mount Kilimanjaro. Towels are in this chest. Aspirin's in the bathroom. The water in the kitchen is filtered. - I don't... - Ah, ah, ah. Stop. I'm gonna go to bed before you tell me about the time you boiled parasitic water from the Ganges. - Good night, Sarah. - Good night, Sean. Sleep tight. What... what the hell? Hey. Wha... Feel me, Sean. That's right. That's what you do to me. Don't. Please, just don't. I know you want me. The way you looked at me. And now I have tangible proof in my hand. I can't, Sarah. I mean it. I can't. What about Curtis? I love Curtis, but... these long separations in our marriage have forced me to be more... Polyamorous. You have an arrangement or open marriage or something? No. I mean I have no idea what Curtis does when he is away. I can only assume that since our sexual encounters are at best... sporadic, he finds some other way of satisfying his needs. Don't ask. Don't tell. He won't ask, and I'll never tell. Sarah, you are a beautiful woman, and I am attracted to you, but I can't do this to Curtis. I never expected you to be such a boy scout. I'm... I'm not. It's just that I've been there, I've done that before, slept with my best friend's wife, and believe me, no amount of pleasure can make up for the guilt. She's gonna be fine, you know. I managed to reconstruct the floor of the orbit, the orbital rim, rebuild her ear, nasal cavity. There's gonna be some swelling, but we can deal with that later. I keep seeing it over and over. Give me something to help me sleep, please. I can if you want, but... you might wanna talk to someone. Your friend has forgiven you. Might be time to forgive yourself. How can I? Every time I try to sleep, I see it... The knife plunging into his back and the eyes staring at me, pleading with me, "Why, mommy? Why are you hurting me?" Did you know that 98% of their DNA is the same as ours? They can give us blood transfusions and vice versa. He would comb my hair ever so gently, and he'd make these little Clay statues while he sat in front of the tv, so expressive. I could see God in those statues. I couldn't have loved him more if he'd been my own. Sheila never approved. He could sense that. Maybe she was afraid. In light of what happened, her instincts proved to be correct. She didn't respect him. She should have known showing up in that new garish makeup would disorient him. And teasing him with that toy? You don't torment an innocent animal. Innocent? He practically ripped her face off. He couldn't help it. He didn't know what he was doing. She was the one who was a grown-up. She should have acted like one. But it was my fault, and I told him that. After they shot him and he just... lay there in all that blood, I told him I was sorry, he was still my good boy, and I would love him forever. Someday, maybe she'll forgive me. I don't know, and frankly who cares? I'll never be able to forgive myself. Hey, I was lookin' for you. Everything ok? Yeah. Yeah, I, um... I was thinkin' how... good Kimber looked in this one black dress she has. So... beautiful, you know. Big tits, teeny little waist. I'm such an asshole. She really did love you, you know. Yeah, well, that was probably her biggest mistake. Listen, there's something that, uh, - I need to tell you. - Shoot. I need to take some time off. I mean, maybe we both do. Maybe we should just shut down the business for a little while and take a vacation. Where would we go? Well, I think we should... go our separate ways for a little while. I mean, you and I have been together for... 20 years practically nonstop. You're gonna work with Curtis. Yeah. Yeah, I am. I'm gonna help the savior center build a hospital. That's what I wanna do. I don't wanna let another opportunity like this pass me by. Then go. But you go for a month, you go forever. Come on. Heh. Does it fit? Heh. Well, you flatter me with a size 2, Christian. Yeah, it fits. Oh, yeah. It's perfect. Did you buy this on rodeo? Here. Try this. It's beautiful. Wanna try it on? Yeah. Of course. May I? What do you think? I think you look just as amazing as she did. Did I do something wrong? I don't know. I'm sorry. I just... We can go shopping for a new dress. I don't know what I was thinking. I just... No, no, no, no, no. It's good. It's good. It's all good. You've been so good to me, really. Really. I can't thank you enough. It's just a little strange, but it's good. Just having you here's been a great comfort for me, so... She loved you very much. Yeah, maybe so, but something of which I'm not entirely worthy. No, don't say that. That's not true. My mother? My mother. She's a lovely woman. She's lonely. She... she lost a daughter. Come on, Christian. What kind of woman sleeps with her daughter's husband? And really, that... that's even a new low for you. We were giving each other comfort in a time of need. It's... human. It's normal. Well, it's a good thing I'm dead so this isn't the final knife in my heart. Everything's a knife in your heart. So what are you gonna do now, Christian? You gonna take care of her? I mean, give me a break. You don't care about my mother. You're just using her like you do everybody. I am who I am, all right? You don't have a say in it. - You killed yourself. - You destroyed me. What is it? I really miss her. I know. Dr. McNamara. Nsolo. How are you? Good. What are you doing here? Well, I know we don't leave for a few weeks, but since it's a Saturday, I thought I'd come down and volunteer for the day. We can always use an extra hand. We're helping the W.H.O. with an airdrop into Kenya on Thursday to help the people who suffered from the flooding. We have over 1,100 units still to pack. Show me where. Curtis. I'll catch up with you. I didn't think you'd be back yet. Ah, something more pressing came up here. Can I help? I've already told Christian, so... I'm officially yours in a couple weeks. You know, you and Christian, you guys are a lot more alike than I ever thought. I mean, you come in here all eager like a puppy, and then you piss all over the carpet. Curtis, what's going on? I don't... Sarah told me, you asshole. And when I got the call, I was holding a 3-month-old little girl severely malnourished, chances of survival practically nil. Her mother died of aids 20 minutes earlier than that. You know, one less doctor there means many less lives saved, but I came home to save my marriage. Curtis, I don't know what she said, but nothing... I mean... Nothing happened. Don't believe you. No, I mean, we went to dinner. She... she got really drunk, and... we both were, but we both went right to sleep. Nothing... nothing happened. Nothing. I wouldn't do that to you. I wouldn't do that to us. Why would my wife lie about screwing an old friend from college?! I have no idea, but you... you gotta believe me. No, I don't. And as executive director, it's gonna be impossible for you to work at the savior center or any of its affiliate missions, so just get out of here, ok? Go back to Christian. You two... you two are obviously meant to be together. Curtis, you gotta let... Ok. Here we go. Dr. McNamara is gonna be in today, and then we can schedule your follow-ups, ok? May I? Oh, absolutely you may. You know that Jane has paid all your bills. You know that. You know, a lot of the swelling has not gone down, and when it does, we will then know how to proceed. It was never going to be what it was. He told me that. But still, we hope. I suppose I should take some comfort in becoming a poster child. If anyone had any doubts about the state passing that ordinance requiring owners to cage their exotic pets, they only have to look at me. Knock-knock. Oh, my. Look at you. You look beautiful. Well, you will look beautiful. Of course you're still swollen and bruised, but that's not surprising. I just knew they were the best. I knew we picked the right doctors to come to. You know, I was just telling her that she's gonna have to take it easy when you leave here tomorrow. I'll make sure of that. I've got the guest room all made up. It'll be like staying at a 5-star resort. And I've got a surprise. Oh, dear. That's not very relaxing, is it? Something to cheer you up. There. That's much better. Wait'll you meet Gunther. He's hilarious. Your favorite. A little comedian in fur. Gunther? Jesus, Jane, you didn't. He's just a baby, Shu-Shu. He's nothing like Wayne. He's just the most adorable thing you ever saw. He's already using a fork and knife. You got another monkey? Chimp. Look at me. Look at me! Look at what that animal did to me! Look at what you did to me. Shu-shu... you get rid of that ape, Jane. Stop showering all your affection on these animals. That's why you can't find love. There's no room for anything human. If you value our friendship, the 30 years we've known each other, you have to choose the monkey or me. That monkey loved me unconditionally. He never judged me, and he forgave me, even when I took his life to save yours. You think your heart will ever be that big? - Hey. - Hey. You mind if I have one of those? Sure. Where's Brandie? Wisconsin. It's for the best. She reminded me too much of Kimber. Aren't you supposed to be getting dysentery shots or something? I'm not going to Africa. Where's Saint Curtis taking you? Nowhere. Turns out he's kind of an asshole. Well, you never were too good at picking partners. He accused me of sleeping with his wife. - Did you? - No. Well, that's good, because sleeping with your friend's wife is very tough on the relationship. I'm stayin'. That's good. Thinkin' 'bout sellin' this place, gettin' a place up in the hills, you know, view of the city lights or... Well, you can't beat this view. I used to love it, but now it's just like looking at a graveyard. It'll pass.
