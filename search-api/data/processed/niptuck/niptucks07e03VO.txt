You think I'm stupid. You hate yourself like I do. I always go back to you because you hate me the best. Will you marry me? Christian loves you, and he is faithful to you. I don't know who he is. I don't know who I am. We're bad. Like, this is really bad. Heck if I don't feel guilty. Curtis? I got to tell you, I was a little shocked when I heard you won the Poland award. We're lucky, though, you know, Sean? Most poor bastards, they never get to find out what their true purpose in life is. Usually, we ask our new clients what they don't like about themselves, but in this case, I think we can figure it out. What happened? - Car accident? - Physics. 170 pound man falls 245 feet, quickly reaching a maximum velocity of 86 miles an hour before he hits the water 4 seconds later... which, I know, doesn't sound like a long time. But it's a frickin' eternity. And was this a suicide attempt? Yeah, at the most cliched spot on the planet... the golden Gate bridge. And you survived the fall. You... must be one in a million. Close. About 1,200 people have jumped from the bridge. Conservative estimate... the current's so strong there, they assume more than that have jumped without being seen, have been swept out to sea or taken by sharks. Only about 40 of us have lived to tell the tale. Why'd you do it? Uh, what my partner means is, we're going to need a complete psychological picture before we can agree to operate on you. I don't mind talking about it. I'm as sane as the next guy. My psychiatrist agrees. You ever try and kill yourself? No. Uh, what about you, Dr. Troy? You know, I've had, uh, rough patches, but I guess I've always been able to... find pleasure in my life somehow. Well, that's lucky. I guess I'm just kind of a naturally depressive personality. I guess, obvious. Just... life's just been... kind of hard for a while. My son died... of leukemia. He was 14 years old. You know, marriages don't survive that kind of thing. I just felt this kind of... darkness building up inside me. The edges of it disappeared, and... it felt like it kind of swallowed me up. Wasn't even painful anymore. Everything just was so hard. Except jumping. Jumping was easy. I remember, I didn't want anybody to see me go over the rail... like I didn't want to get in trouble somehow. And I went over the rail, and there's a lip, and I stood there, and then, I just stepped... I mean, the way, you know, you step out of... bed in the morning, I stepped. And I thought to my self, "no, not this. Go back. Stop. Go back!" By second 2, I knew I wanted to live. I've never been so sure of anything in my life. What did you do? Well, most of the people who've survived landed feet first. So... I somehow managed to flip myself over and hit... the water like a blade of grass. And it still felt like a cinderblock to the balls, though. Broke 2 vertebrae in my pelvis and, you know, obviously, the reason I'm here. Broke all 14 bones in your face, but your jaw is remarkably intact. Uh, Mr. Seabrook, we may not be able to make you look the way you looked before. I don't care about that. I just want to look normal. Jumping gave me a second chance to live my life, to follow my dreams. I want to go back to school, maybe... become a therapist, start dating again. You know, maybe, uh... Maybe have another kid. You must be in a lot of pain. You know how they say when you die, your life flashes before your eyes? It's not true. You don't see all the things you've done. You see... all the things you're never going to get a chance to do, all the opportunities you're going to lose. I didn't jump to my death. I jumped to my life. I just need you to help me to live it.

Contactez-nous sur le topic de cet épisode sur le site Baby, that feels so good Ok. Come inside me. Well... Aren't you... No. I mean, no. I'm good. I don't need to. You do it. Oh! Oh, oh, my gosh, Sean! Oh! Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. That was insane. That was weird. Why? I'm not used to you not coming. I don't always need to come. Well... I do. Honey, we're married. We have, like, a lifetime of orgasms ahead of us. We're good. It's good. We're good. Why stay with him? Are you suggesting that you and I... No. I want to know. Why stay with him, if it makes you so unhappy? I don't know. The same reason you do, I guess. Kind of feel sorry for the guy, huh? Unlucky bastard. He survived a fall from the golden Gate bridge. How is that unlucky? He went from being depressed and suicidal to completely delusional in 700 feet. He really thinks he's going to change his life now. And you don't believe him. How many times have you sworn off drinking and then wake up with a hangover? Same thing, right? Having a hangover and attempting suicide are not the same thing. You would know, I guess. What's that supposed to mean? I'm just saying that people don't change just because they think they're going to die and then get a second chance. You had cancer. You thought you were going to die. You're saying that didn't give you the courage to look at life a little differently? For about a week, yeah, maybe. All right? I think there's no way you can't change after something like that. So tell me, how is your life so different since you swam out to the buoy? At a certain age, you just accept who you are and stop thinking there's something better out there. You're right. You haven't changed at all. You married Kimber, and you still screw around every chance you get. Which reminds me, I was having lunch at shutters the other day, picked up these 2 hot sisters who both want to go up 2 cup sizes. They're coming in on Thursday. Unbelievably hot, trust me. I told them that'd be cool. Is that cool with you? Why don't you finish up here? I forgot. I have a meeting I need to get to. We have a consult after this. Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mr. Wise. Uh, don't get the wrong idea. I wasn't trying to kill myself. Mr. Wise, the gash around your neck was clearly made by a belt, probably spiked, from the sharp indentations left at perfectly spaced intervals. The skin's been ripped and twisted. Not a surprising consequence when you try to hang yourself. Kudos, Sherlock. Spiked belt it was, although you haven't solved the case just yet. I wasn't trying to commit suicide. I was masturbating. Autoerotic asphyxiation. Gone awry. My bad. I just... need you to fix this so that I can stop wearing scarves and turtlenecks when it's 18 degrees outside. I liked you better when I thought you tried to kill yourself. You risk dying for an orgasm? It wasn't just an orgasm, it was the orgasm of a lifetime. You have no idea. Cutting off the blood supply to the brain provides an amazing high. I do have an idea. It's better than any drug you've ever had... I've ever had. Includes quite an extensive list, I can tell you. Don't knock it if you ain't tried it, doc. Thanks, but, you know, I can usually find someone to help me out. Call it the perks of being married. Right. Been there. Divorced now. Look, all I'm saying is, you cut off the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain, your dick gets unbelievably hard. That's why these guys who are hung get these huge, stonking boners and ejaculate when they die. It's called induced... induced cerebral anoxia. I know. That's right. You get this euphoria. It's like having one foot in heaven. So, I take it you're going to continue with this practice even after I, uh, repair the damage to your neck? Don't worry, doc. I'll stick to silk ties from now on. Same high without the ring around the collar. Look, I'm asking you to fix this, not how I choose to come. Judge not, right? - Excuse me. - May I help you? Yeah. I'm looking for Dr. Ryerson. Is he expecting you? We spoke earlier on the phone. I'm Sean McNamara. Oh! Dr. Mcnamara. Yes. I'm Nsolo. Curtis told me you were coming by. You and your partner were the other recipients of the other Poland award this year. Congratulations. Follow me, please. Hey! Sean, thanks for coming. Hey, how was your drive? - Just fine. - Good. Let me know if there's anything you need while in San Diego, anything at all. Thanks. Nsolo stepped on a land mine in Angola. He was a beggar at the airport when we met him, and now he... practically runs the entire center when I'm on the road, which is about 10 months out of the year. Well, I'm glad you were in town. I've been wanting to see your operation since we talked in Miami. Well, here it is, in all its glamour. Not exactly Beverly Hills, but... That's a good thing. So, uh... What's going on with Christian? Oh, he's still sucking the champagne and caviar out of life. After the ceremony, you guys took off so quickly, - I thought maybe... - Sorry about that, Curtis. I had to jump on the next flight. There was an emergency back at the office. So... I cannot tell you how many trips I've had to cut short and hop on a plane. I remember once, crop duster came and picked us up on the serengeti on the way to a malaria outbreak in darfur. An angry herd of wildebeests chases us down the runway, I kid you not. Barely got out of there with our necks. The closest I've come to anything like that would be bumper-to-bumper on the 405 with Christian, who's in a bad mood 'cause he's late for his massage. That's why I called you. I'm here because... I want to help. So what can I do? Well, we are flying a 12-year-old girl in from Jakarta on Thursday. Her husband cut her in the face with a machete when she fought off his rape attempt. What we need is a surgeon and an O.R. Consider it done. You sure about this? I mean, maybe think about it, talk to Christian. No, I don't need to talk to Christian. Just something I want to do, something I probably should have done a long time ago. All right. Well, I'll set it up for Thursday. Great. This is really going to make a difference, Sean. What are you doing? I want to make my baby happy. If my baby's not happy, then I'm not happy. - I'm half asleep... - Look, just tell me what you want. Anything. I want you... don't worry about me. I'm fine. You don't seem fine to me. Come on. Yeah. Get it, baby. What are you doing? Oh, trust me. Trust me. Trust me. Trust me, baby. You got to trust me, ok? You're going to have the come of your life, I promise. Ok. Trust me. Look at me. Look at me. You got to trust me. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. That's my baby. Next time, you do me, baby. Sorry, partner. I was performing a slipindicktomy. Are we in high school? You have to brag about having sex with your wife? We are not talking about sex, partner. I gave Kimmie the orgasm of her lifetime, ok? I mean, Kimmie's toes curled up like the wicked witch of the east, and it's all because of Mr. Wise in there. Seriously. I mean, we were having marital problems. The sex was all, you know, whatever. Anyway, I took his advice and tried erotic asphyxiation. You choked your wife? Ok, come on. It's not like I'm O.J. or something, all right? I know how to deal with the pressure. I'm a doctor. Oh, you're right. That's very romantic. Trust me. Kimber loved it. Not as much as you did, though. What's that supposed to mean? Everything is about power for you. You're not satisfied... unless you're dominating your partner. You do live with your hand on her throat, might as well screw her that way, too, right? Jeez, what's up your ass today, huh? Kimber deserves better than this. You know, if you're having problems, why don't you try talking about it? Ok, Mr. Marriage counselor guy. Ok. You're giving me advice, right? Last time I checked, you've been divorced... how many times? Same as me, right? And since when do you care about Kimber so much? Guys, are you clean enough? The guy's been under for 6 minutes. Hey. Sean... Sean... No, no, no, no. No... don't talk. Don't talk. Isn't that what you like now? No. Sean. Sean! Ugh! Sean, stop it! Jesus. Kimber... Hey, look. I know about the choking. He told me. I just want to know if you're ok. It's fine. It's not as bad as it looks. You should get somebody to look at that, you know? Sean, stop it. I really... I really don't want you to touch me right now, ok? I came here because we need to stop doing this. Ok. Ok? Just ok? What do you want me to say? "Stay, we can work it out"? Well, I would have thought maybe you'd have a little bit more feeling than that, or for me. It's never what this was about. You know that. Ok. Then I guess that's it. You're not going back to him, are you? He's my husband, Sean. You deserve better. I know. And the only reason why I haven't been able to get it it is because I'm fooling around with his best friend, and I am just as much to blame for my own unhappiness as anybody. And if I'm going to get what I deserve, I need to take a little bit of responsibility, refocus on my marriage... even if that means being completely honest with him. How long you been going behind my back, you cheating bastard? I come in this morning expecting to be waist-deep in double Ds. Instead, I find my 2 bimbos out in the lobby trying to reschedule. Oh, cool your jets. We'll fit your bimbos in. And I promise, this operation won't cost you a Penny. Good to see you, Christian. I don't give a shit about the money. If you're operating on somebody who needs it, that's fine. There's a first. And... and what about him? I mean, where did he come from, huh? Last time we saw each other, you were too embarrassed to say good-bye, and now you're working together in our surgical suite. Curtis said he needed some help, and I jumped at the opportunity. And you just forgot to tell me. Frankly, I didn't think you'd care. Bullshit. You knew exactly what you were doing. Why don't you scrub in? You can help us with these grafts here. No, thank you, Curtis. I have no desire to be around Sean when he's got his tongue so far up your ass. Sorry about that. Guess you never got around to telling him you're going to be gone to Africa for a month, huh? Sorry to interrupt. We really do need to get a "do not disturb" sign on that door. You know, nurse Linda's come in a couple of times. She needs to take your vitals. That's fine. I'm through. You know, maybe you should go finish off in the bathroom. Really, it's not worth the effort. I've had farts that were more exciting. Why don't we take a look, huh? How's it look? Looks pretty good. Very good, in fact. How's the patient doing? Depressed. That's just the anesthesia wearing off. You'll be fine in a couple of days. Bullshit. I've been rubbing myself raw, fantasizing my ass off. Sex without asphyxiation is about as exciting as... a day without sunshine? Right. I forgot. You liked me better suicidal. Oh, no, no, no. I don't. I mean, I did, but... I don't. I've been having some trouble in my marriage, and... I think you might have just... helped it. She was a little scared at first. Thought I was trying to choke her to death or something. - And? - It worked. It worked. Probably the greatest orgasm I've ever seen. I mean... And how was it when she did you? Blow your mind or what? No, no, no. I'm better at giving than receiving. Well, it depends what you're receiving. Believe me, if you want to discover your capacity for limitless ecstasy, go beyond what you ever thought possible, get her to return the favor. Your marriage will last forever. Well, I think the neck's coming along fine. As long as you stay off the windpipe for a couple of months, maybe forever, you'll be good. You know what it's like? To have experienced heaven, and now be denied entry? You know, I think I'll get you a couple of girl-on-girl action videos, so I'll talk to my anesthesiologist, get a recommendation. Hey, handsome. Hey, honey. I'm just going to jump on the treadmill before I get some dinner. What? Come over here. What? Sit. What are you doing? You look like a bitch in heat, Kimmie. - Do i? - Yeah. Well, I'm actually a tigress, and you are a tortoise. A tortoise? That's exciting. I've been reading the kama sutra book. You're not the only creative lover. I like creative, huh? Why don't you get me off like I got you off? Well, I'm not really into that sort of thing. Come on. No? But I want you to lay back. Right here. Spread your legs. Give me your hands. Come on. Come on. You're the tigress. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, Christian. Oh, that's so good. What are you doing? What? You don't come like that with me. That's... but I'm having an orgasm. You faked that. - No, I did not. - Yes, you did. Bullshit. - Filthy old porn trash. - Oh, thanks. I'm sorry. This is the only time I've done it, ok? I've never done it before. I promise. And why should I believe that, huh? Well, because I'm not really into the choking thing. - It freaks me out. - Well, why didn't you just tell me? - Because I feel guilty. - Guilty? What the hell for? I think that you have made the right decision. There's not much choice. It's... peach or blueberry. I overheard Ryerson on his cell after you 2 worked on that girl the other day. You're going with him to Africa. I just want you to know, I think it's really great. I mean, I do hate you for leaving, but I do understand. And by the way, when the hell were you going to tell me? I mean, should I update my resume? It hasn't sunk in yet. What did Christian say? Haven't told him. Yet. Don't say anything, ok? You know, it's funny. After all these years of you changing people, and you being the one who needed it. Shithead was right. Feels like an orgasm everywhere...</i> in my feet, shoulders.</i> Oh, God. Going to come.</i> Get up and take the belt off.</i> Shit. I can't move. There's not enough...</i> I can't feel... I can't breathe. Stand up and take the goddamn belt off.</i> Get up. Get up! Christian? Christian? Jesus Christ Christian! Christian! No. Are you ok? Are you sure you don't want them to come? Did you try and kill yourself? What is it, the choking thing? Honey, if it is, I don't care. I'll do it. I'll do whatever you want. I'll be a slave, if you want. I don't want a slave. I didn't mean it like that. That's not what I meant. Yes, it is. I had this... Moment of clarity before I lost consciousness. You'll never make me happy. I... Can never love you enough. Oh, baby. You are not... thinking clearly. You don't have enough oxygen in your brain. You don't know what you're saying. I've never felt so clear. Christian, we've hit a rough patch. You don't break up because of it. We said "for better or worse", remember? Yeah. I can't that part. Ok, look. This is my fault. It's my fault. I've been a bad wife, and I've done really bad things. But I'm so sorry, and I'll make it up to you. And I know that you'll love me again. Can you hear what you're saying? I'm not good for you. I'm meant to be alone. He kicked me out. That's it. It's over. He's done with me now. You've heard that before... How many hundreds of times? No, it's different this time. You should have seen the look at his face. We're like 2 strangers. I mean, the guy doesn't even like me. Good. He's doing you a favor, Kimber. It's a gift. But I don't want that kind of gift. I want one that includes him, one for us. I mean, he's where I belong. Not anymore. Maybe you never did, right? Maybe it was just your fear of not belonging anywhere that made you so stuck. Doesn't matter now. All that matters now is, what are you going to do? This is your opportunity, Kimber. Jump. Take the leap. Find out who you are without him telling you you're not good enough, pretty enough, smart enough. Do it before you get too old and you can't. I'm not like you, Sean. I don't hate Christian. And I certainly don't want to be him, either. Hey. Hey. What's the with bad mood? Well, I don't really enjoy hanging out with a bunch of Hollywood skanks. Oh, come on. They're nice girls, Kimber. You said we were going to be alone. You'll get your turn. There's more than enough Mike to go around. Ok. Just give me a second. I'll be right there. I believe April is next. Excuse me. I thought I was the one you wanted to spend the rest of your life with. So did I. Wow. Crazy times, huh? I'll tell you what. It's a good thing you kicked my ass to the curb that final time. I mean, it's taken a shitload of curbs, but... I think I finally got the message. I'm sorry about that. It was shitty. And... I don't have an excuse other than I was... obsessed with Christian. But I don't feel that way. And you're so good to me, and we're good together, and I just... I really, in my heart, feel that 2 people that are right for each other need to spend the rest of their lives together. Honey, I've got more bumps and bruises than a rodeo clown. I can handle the pain, but... after a while, you just get tired of being laughed at. Listen... do me a favor, will you, Kimber? I've got a Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1986 over at the bar. Why don't you be a sweetie and go get it? And bring a corkscrew. Kimber? The wine? Not yet. I plan to take him to his favorite strip club and... drop the bomb there, let naked women soften the blow. Uh, no. Not anymore. He kicked his wife out. Listen, Curtis, I was thinking we could author an article together based on this trip. I have an idea for a new procedure on patients with neurofibromatosis. Great. Ok. Yeah. Well, we'll talk about it when I see you in a few days. Ah. I got to go. Ok. Bye. What? Kimber fell off a boat last night. She's, uh... She's missing. What? Whose boat? Mike coast guard thinks she, uh... thinks she's dead. Wait. I... don't understand what happened. She... She slipped and fell off the boat? I think she jumped. Jumped? Yeah. Suicide? Well, but the coast guard is still searching, so they could still find her. Impossible. 12 hours? Can't survive in the water that long, you know. I kicked her out last night. I told her I wanted her out of my life. I shouldn't have... I should have... I don't know what to do. There you are. Hey, Dr. Mcnamara, I wanted to thank you and Dr. Troy for the excellent care I've received here. Is he around? No. He's... You look like you're healing well, Mr. Seabrook. I feel great. Today really is the first day of the rest of my life, and I'm not going to let another day pass doing things I don't want to do or feeling ways I don't want to feel. Good for you. I wish you luck with everything. Hope the same for you, Dr. Mcnamara.
