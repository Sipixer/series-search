- But what about our kids? - I want them to come with me. I'm pregnant. It's Sean's sperm. You're gonna raise another child? I have no legal rights, and I am fine with that. - Leishmaniasis. - Why bring him to us? I want what's best for my son. You've got a shot at the real thing with Ramona. Ava's just gonna toss you aside the second she's done with you. He's late. What else is new? I swear, if he comes through that door with that bitch, I'm gonna throw them bot off the balcony. Well, if it isn't our very own Benjamin Braddock. Do we really need to start right in with all the jerk-off comments, Christian? You bet your ass you do. We're the ones who had to fight off Ramona's family to stop them hunting you down and treating you like a pinata. It was like the Alamo in there. Yeah. They were pretty pissed, huh? You left her at the altar. Humiliated her. All of them. Yeah, I know, I know. And I'm gonna clear that up as soon as things settle down and we get back from Brazil. Well, Ava found a doctor in Rio who's willing to do Rafael's surgery. And what about Jenna? You planning on taking your daughter with you? No. And that's actually why I came by. I wanted to ask you guys if she could stay with you for a couple of weeks. I'm gonna be spending all my time taking care of Rafael and Ava. Are you sure you didn't drop him on his head when he was a baby? You're not thinking clearly, Matt. I've never had less doubt about anything in my life. I love her. I've always loved her. She doesn't love you. Stop trying to twist everything and diminish our feelings for each other. You know, I give up. It's amazing how you keep finding new and creative ways to screw up your life. All right, we'll take care of Jenna, but get me the name of this doctor in Brazil so I can check him out. Thanks. I will. Why you doing this? I can't stop him anymore than I can't stop you. All I can do is try to protect my granddaughter. - Where is she? - She's sleeping. Maybe when you get back I'll let you see her. Well, you can't do this, she's my daughter. And you're abandoning her to lie down with that she-devil. Now, get the hell out of here, or I swear to God you'll never see her again. Ok. Nip/Subs Team presents Season 7 - Episode 9 "Hiro Yoshimura" Original VO: honeybunny Original VO corrected by chamallow35 Corrections & Resynchro VO : Sean 2, 3, 4, 5. 9? Oh! Dammit, dammit. Dammit. You know, you guys are gonna have to get an intern, because I can't be doing this all day. Why you looking at me like that? I think she's ready, don't you? Definitely. Put this on. It's not my birthday, so I'm just assuming you're taking me in front of a firing squad. Surprise. Is this a joke? A joke would have been putting your name first on the sign. I thought it looked best underneath ours, like you're supporting us, which is what you've always done. Welcome to the practice, partner. Lawyer should be getting you the paperwork in the next few days. What about the baby? He doesn't have to sign anything. I mean, I can't ask for my first official business as partner to take maternity leave. You won't have to. I'm having a nursery put in. You can keep the little guy around all the time. - You never told me that. - I know. I was thinking you two are the closest thing I have to family now. I want to make sure we all stick together. Sean, thank you, I am so flattered. This has been a dream for years. I don't even know what to say. We're gonna help you with that, too. Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mr... Yoshimura. What's not to like? I'm an actor. Over 100 films. I thought you looked familiar. What would I have seen you in? That would be hard to say. I only really work in Japan. Could you give me a couple of titles? They are what you would call adult affair. - You mean... - Yes. Gosh, you lucky bastard. So what brings you to the States? I'm hoping to cross over. America has the biggest market in adult movies in the world. Well, judging from your excellent skin tone, I think a facelift, perhaps an eyelift. We could shave 20 years off your appearance. They want to make you look younger? The market I'm in works because of my age. - How old are you? - 73. For people in my generation, the movies I make with the wrinkles and exuberance say getting old is not the end of life. You can still have fun. Wouldn't you say? How can we help? I had a heart attack right after my wife died 6 years ago. I used to say I almost died from a broken heart. Truth was, I was depressed. - You were in mourning. - No. I had nothing to do. But now... I'm in a job where I'm valued. Most people my age don't have that anymore. To stay busy, to do what you love, it has given me a second chance in life. Which is why I need to get rid of the scar. You want your audience to be reminded of life when they look at you on the screen and not death. And this is America. Old or young, appearances still do matter. You know, I always see these people we operate on as just patients. You know, how much do you weigh, do you have any allergies? I never get to hear them tell their stories. And? And... it's harder to judge them. Are you trying to tell us that you're wrong for judging us after all these years? I am saying that I have a new appreciation for what you do, but it doesn't make you any less dickheads. We all knew what we were getting in to when we chose this field of medicine. And we all knew that some of the cases would be unsavory. But worrying about why people come here gets in the way of what they're coming here to have done. Are you stealing meds from the store room? I, for one, am liking the new Sean's attitude, by the way. We've spent years changing the way people look. I am proof-positive that people can change on the inside, too. Thank you, Linda. Oh, my God. We have to have this. Yeah, it's pretty fantastic. Sean, what has happened to our farewell lunch? Oh, just a few more minutes. The restaurant's right across the street. Excuse me, miss. Do you have one in the back? - Yeah. - Great. Sean, I was wondering, how's Liz with all of this? Has she asked for a lot of help? Why would you ask that? What new mother wouldn't want help? I just wondered if you discussed, you know, how involved you'll be. Well, we're not married, we're not a couple, but I'm not a sperm bank, either. Oh, look. Didn't we have this exact one for Conor? Yeah, I think we did. Sean, so wait a minute. You haven't formalized any boundaries, had any talks about... anything? No. We will. We will. Sean, can I just ask you, what happened to your plans to work with Curtis? Curt... forget about Curtis. What is going on with you? - Sean. - Look at this. No, it's not funny. Listen to me. For the first time in your life, you can do whatever you want. You're still relatively young, you know. You're brilliant. You know what, I have finally made some peace with my life, recommitted myself to the practice, the partnership. Liz is a bigger part of the family than ever. And there is a baby on the way. Why are you acting like there's something wrong? Sean, I just want you to have your best life. Ok, you know, maybe I am just reading too much. You know what, I think you feel guilty because you're taking my kids to London. You're reading all kinds of things into everything. I do. Julia, I'm fine with it. Let's go get some lunch. Oh, look at this. Look at this rocking chair. Hudson, get him out of here. Hudson and I have a little understanding. Take it away, Hudson. You and I have no business whatsoever to discuss. Ok. I guess I'll take Rafael's surgery off the books, then. May I? It's really too good a year to go to waste. What are your terms? Oh, come on, sweetie pie. Just have a little think about it. You'll operate on my son if I leave yours. You really do have the heart of a negotiator, don't you? I love Matt. I care about him deeply. If you think... I think that you would do anything possible to get what you want. And what makes you think Matt is not what I want? Because of the way you look at him. You look at him like you own him. That's not love. How the hell would you know? Because I've seen the way you look at Rafael. Fine. Fix my baby. Make him the way God intended him to be. And I'll tell Matt I'm not... available. Do me a favor. Let him down easy, would you? Stupid shit actually thinks you love him. Hudson, we're good. Do you think this is gonna work? Ava just wants her baby fixed. It's... what she wanted all along. - Hey, not to interrupt, but... - What are you doing here? Well, I just wanted to thank you for doing the surgery. It means the world to Ava and me. Don't move. So tell me, why did Matt just come in gushing about how happy he is that we're doing the surgery. Well, it has to be this way, don't you see? You have no real desire to help me or my child. You're right about that. I tell you one thing, ok, that kid is not gonna see a scalpel until you come up with your end of the deal. You don't trust me? And I don't trust you. So as soon as you begin the operation, I'll tell Matt he's not part of our future. It'll happen at the same time. 15 blade. This isn't happening, Matt. Don't worry, he's gonna be fine. He's gonna be perfect. That's not what I'm talking about. You're not leaving with Rafael and me. We don't need you. We don't want you. You came back. You came back to me, remember? And I know you love me, Ava, so why are you doing this? I don't love you, Matt. The truth is... I've never loved you. Conor's definitely outgrown the sandals. Annie's definitely outgrown her Hello Kitty phase. Oh, God, it's just so hard to believe that she's such a... young lady now. I bet. What happened to Sean? That's what I want to know. You know, why did he change his mind about Curtis? He came to his senses is what happened. Yeah, well, that's what he says, but he keeps saying these weird things like, you know, "I've accepted my life. I'm embracing who I am," like some sort of robotic affirmation tape. Meaning? Meaning he wanted something else, and you know that. I mean, with the kids and I going to London, I mean, he has less reason than ever to stay in a job he doesn't love. And yet for some reason, he's more entrenched than ever. Entrenched. Well, you love it. But he doesn't love it anymore. And he's afraid to make the leap because he's afraid to leave you. If he wanted to save the world, he'd be doing it. Ok? I think he's better off than he ever has been. He's happy, he's upbeat. I mean, we're having fun again. He's in denial. He's staving off his feelings, you know, like he's shoring up the levee. You're wrong. Sean doesn't leave me because I'm different than everybody else in his life. I love him. I need him. You know what you do, Christian. You steal people's souls. Now, you tried it with me and I got lucky, I escaped. So I'm gonna pray for Sean. I'm gonna pray that his luck changes. Is mine mei or kei? If mine's mei or... Oh. This is fantastic. - It was your idea. - I know it was. A man needs an anchor in his life. I used to think mine was Julia, Julia and the kids. That's bullshit. So what's your anchor? You. You and the business. And I want to do like 10 tit jobs a day, and then I just want to spend the money. What about all that pro Bono shit? Maybe you're just too scared to do that stuff. I'm not scared. I just know I want to be here with you. Hey, do you think we can talk them into getting implants? Let's dance a little bit. Let's dance. Have you ever considered going up to a "D"? No, really. You'd be amazed. Just that little bit of difference can... Little bit more and you're fantastic. Have fun, pal. Does anyone want a drink? Just a little. Why don't you guys just go get a cab? Thanks, sweetie. Bye. - Sorry. - That's ok. All right. Seany. Come on, buddy. Come on. Come on, get up. Get up. I thought I told you to take a cab. Hey, sailor. Kimber? I missed you so much. Really? Yeah. 'Cause I didn't miss you. I know I said to you that I did, but not so much. I think I'm finally free of you now. Don't say that. You're the best thing that ever happened to me. And yet you stole my soul. I had to kill myself to get away from you. That was the only way out. And now Sean's killing himself, too, Christian. If he stays with you, he's a dead man. I didn't expect there to be so much... so many scars. He'll require a few more procedures. Will the... the markings go away eventually? It'll take a series of operations. One a year for the next 5 years. 5 years? But then after that, he'll be fine? Evidence of the scarification won't be visible? No. He'll look better, that much I can promise you, but... some of the scarring will be permanent. He'll never be perfect. Nothing that breathes is perfect. When I was young, my, uh, my father told me the story of a bird handler. He decided to paint the strongest of his birds a different color. As it flew toward its flock, they instantly attacked it, violently pecking the intruder to death. My father was trying to warn me to be different is to lead a life of pain and persecution. He was right. I survived it once. I can't survive it again. The estate will provide for him. He'll be well taken care of. What about love? Will the estate provide that? Will life? I will never understand you. Sure you do, Sean. Look at this place. You're the high priest of conformity. You dance around the golden calf shouting, "how you look is who you are." Different is just another word for ugly. I'm not the monster, Sean. I'm just one of its victims. Be strong, my love. Survive. Ok. You ready? Oh, Sean, I'm scared. The sign in the lobby almost gave me an aneurysm. Ta-da. What do you think? Isn't it great? You know, we can even hire some help if we want to. Someone to watch over him or her when... we're in surgery, but at least... he'll be with us. Us? This isn't your baby, Sean. I came to you because I thought you were respected the fact that I wanted to do this on my own. I'm sorry, Liz, but I thought I could just be there when you needed me, when the baby needed me. The baby isn't gonna need you. The baby has me. Fine. Sooner or later, he's gonna want to know who his dad is. And I'm gonna tell him or her, and if they want to look, I'm not gonna stop them. Well. At least he won't have to go far to find me. I can't stay here, Sean. I should have known this was a really stupid, stupid idea. I mean, how could I expect you to just... give me your sperm and... then want nothing? But I don't, Liz. I don't want anything. Oh, Sean. You can lie to yourself if you want, but I see it. I mean, I should have seen it before. This is my chance to be a parent. You've already had yours. Where are you gonna go? I don't know. But don't want you to come and find us. Ok. Promise. Jesus. Can you at least let me know where you are? I care about you, Liz. And I care about you. Grandpa! What are you doing home? The question is, why are you not in school, toji? Get back to UCLA. You have thermodynamics in half an hour. Yes, sir, grandfather. Now, what do we have here, little lady? I've heard about you, grandpa. Your size is legendary. I don't know if I could handle you all by myself. Don't worry, you don't have to. I've asked over some friends. Oy! Oh, grandfather. He's dead? Massive heart attack right after monster orgasm. I'm so sorry. Poor guy. I guess the strain was just too much. No, not poor guy. Hiro died a very happy man. He lived and died the way he wanted to. We should all be so lucky. You got one of those for me? You know, I was afraid you wouldn't answer the door if you saw it was me, so I came up from the beach. Can I come in? Only if you're here because you brought me a new... 30 year old bottle of scotch. I, uh, came here to get my daughter back. Ava's gone, Christian. Now I need to get on with my life. You know what it is to be a father, Matt? It's about sacrifice. Sacrificing everything you have for your kids. I haven't seen any part of... you that makes me think that you're capable of that. Yes, I am. When was the last time you did anything... that wasn't about putting your needs first? Today when I begged Ramona to get back together with me. And she actually took you back? Wait a minute. Wait! Get away from... You embarrassed me in front of my entire family. She still wants to get married? Yeah. She... was an angel about the whole thing. I told her I was gonna get Jenna so that we could begin the healing process. I'm a good father, Christian. Or... or I can be. You ready to go home, sweetheart? Yeah? Come over here. Give me a hug. Your daddy's come to take you home. Kiss. Give me a kiss? Hi, baby. I'm gonna make you proud. Ok, here you go. You're gonna be just fine. You're strong. Sean, I just got off the phone with the place... Ava took the baby from. And? And they have an affiliate in Phoenix, and they want to come pick him up tomorrow. No. They're gonna come get him, Sean. He's not yours. You can't just keep him here indefinitely. I'm not letting him on a plane for 14 hours after what he's just been through. Period. Tell them I will call them when I think he's ready. It's ok. Come on. Oh, come here. I know. I know. It's ok. Yeah. It's ok. It's ok. You sure about this, Sean? Of course I am. This might be the last time we break bread together as a family. Next time you'll be a married woman again. Might be the last time you get a decent meal in a while, London isn't exactly known for its cuisine. I'll get the spoons, dad. And you, Liz, you'll be a mother soon. You guys excited about going to London? You should see Edmund's house. It's like a castle. Where's Matt? He and Ramona should be here by now. Oh, he called to say that they couldn't make it. Something about a sale on at rug world or whatever. So we said our goodbyes. Now, Sean, is there anything that I can do to help? Nope. It's all taken care of. All right. I would like to thank each of you for being part of my family. I love you all. To cherished memories... and bright futures. Bright futures. Cheers. All right. Bye, dad. I know that the next time we see each other, it will be as if not a day has gone by. I'll still be sucking the champagne and caviar out of life. I love you. Look after him for me. I will. Call me when you land. Promise. Goodbye, Julia. Bye. I'll start cleaning. Where's our 10:00? And why are there workers messing with our new sign? I cancelled the consult. Sit down. Tell me what you don't like about yourself. Yeah, um, we're in surgery all day, so when are you planning on rescheduling Mrs. Howe's consult? Just answer the question. Why? Because we've always used it to manipulate people into thinking that they can change, but they... can't. You want to have an intellectual conversation about this? Fine. I do think people can change. Look at me. I mean, I was very unhappy for... a long time. But now I'm settled, I'm content. Pretending you're not miserable isn't changing, it's... denial. Did you cancel Mrs. Howe... just so you could give me a hard time? Sean, I'm trying to help you here, buddy boy. You know, I've had thousands of people sit across this desk from me, begging me to turn them from a caterpillar into a butterfly. The only one I've ever met who actually has a real chance at doing that... is you. Me? Mm-hmm. You. I know I can't. Don't want to. Why would I want to change my life? I have a great partner. And aside from this ridiculous conversation, a thriving practice. And... now that Julia and the kids are really gone, I'm free. I am free... to see whoever I want. So. Why are you making this so hard? Making what so hard? You're all over the place. I wanted this to last forever, you know that. I'm dissolving our partnership. What? I won't to work with you anymore. You can't make a unilateral decision like that. Legally speaking, yes, I can. It's gonna cost me some, but... I already have my attorneys drawing up the papers. Oh, bullshit. I'm here on my terms, and if and when I choose to leave, it will be on my terms. Bucharest? I want you take Rafael back. I see how you look at him, Sean. Take him back. See what happens. These are one-way tickets. I'm sure they could use you there. All those sick kids. They could use a good surgeon, somebody who wants to spend... their life healing people. And in 6 months when I'm pining for the glamour of Hollywood? We both know that's not gonna happen. Besides, you'd have nothing to come back to. Someday you'll thank me for this. May I have your attention, please.</i> TSA paging Mary Ellen Bovar.</i> Mary Ellen Bovar, please...</i> Walk you to security? I couldn't afford first class, but... I can't let you do this. I didn't ask your permission. Slow down. We need to talk. About Rafael. What about him? Well, I know you changed your mind about adopting him. Wrong. I abandoned him like a stray dog with mange. Look at me, Matt. Get the smoke out of your eyes and see me for who I am. I do see you, Ava. Every inch of you chiseled to perfection. But being perfect hasn't made you complete, has it? And you think you're the one who can complete me? I don't love you, Matt. I don't care. Well, you should. You're young, and some day you'll find someone who loves you back. Right. Now who's got the smoke in their eyes? Hey. Let me tell you something. I'm never gonna love anyone as much as I love you. And I've pretty much accepted the fact that you're as good as it's gonna get for me. What about me? Have you thought about why I'd want to spend my life... with someone I didn't love? Because Jenna is as good as it's gonna get for you. I may be a total screw-up, but somehow... I've produced a daughter who is as perfect as a child can be. Go on, take her. A little girl of your own to love and a man who completely adores you. That's not such a bad deal, is it? Now tell me we're not the perfect family. Here we go. Good job. Passports? Tickets? May I have your attention please.</i> TSA paging Mary Ellen Bovar. Mary Ellen Bovar...</i> Have you started interviewing potential partners yet? No, I think we'll just keep... holding down the fort on our own for a bit, you know. Can't replace you, anyway. Well, I guess this it, huh? You excited? Excited, terrified, and grateful. Thank you. See ya. This your son? Yes. Can I buy you a drink? I don't drink. One for the road? No, thanks. I have to... operate tomorrow. You're a doctor?
