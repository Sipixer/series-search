to protect the people that we love. Just answer me! I am Matt's father! Christian is. Get out of my house! You've always been weak. I gave you my whole life to make you strong... and I want you out! Sean, what are you doing? Sean, no! I loved you the most. I have to agree with Sean. Your turning out to be the father of his teenage son...</i> will trigger the force majeure clause of the partnership agreement. Certainly a cataclysmic and unforeseen event. That was 17 years ago. Before we even signed that contract. There must be a statute of limitations. There's no statue of limitations on being a backstabbing asshole. After what you did how could I ever trust you again? With a lot of hard work, on both of our parts. Yes, I screwed up. So did Julia, but we were 23. We were just kids. You're my brother, Sean. Brothers don't sleep with each other's wives. Dr. Bahar is the best couples' therapist in Miami. He specializes in business partnerships on the rocks. Our business isn't on the rocks, it's smashed to hell, mast to rudder. What about a cooling-off period? Before we do something rash and stupid. I don't want to cool off. I want you to box up your office and get the hell out of my life. Fine, but it won't be a mole removal. You want out? It's gonna get invasive. I get custody of the furniture I picked out for the waiting room... the anesthesia machine, Liz. That machine is worth over $90,000. You can't have it and Liz. May I speak frankly? Right now, you each net over $1.4 million a year. Split up, you'd be lucky to earn half that, combined. Business breakups are oftentimes more devastating and ugly than a marital split. Loyal and grapevine clients are likely to get confused. Which doctor is the better one? Patients end up going somewhere else for fear of choosing the wrong doctor.</i> Apart, you guys are nowhere near as strong as you are together. Not at this phase of your lives. - That's not something I'm worried about. - You should be. You think patients will travel from all over the state to visit you... in your office with your birds of paradise and faux marble tiles? It'll be easier for me to find a decorator... than for you to find a doctor who will carry your dead weight. If you're irreconcilable, I suggest you both list the company's assets independently... and we'll divide things as amicably as possible. What about surgeries already on the books? I've cancelled everything past this afternoon... except the Rosenberg case next week. Of course. Keep the one pro bono on the docket. It's a high profile case. The good publicity will boost both our future practices. I've seen your work over the last 10 years. You'll need all the help you can get. I'm not going. This operation requires two plastic surgeons. Lives are at stake. Or do you wanna destroy more than you already have? What is my severance? I feel I'm owed that. You're not gonna be out of work, Liz. We'd like to offer you a position in our new practices. You're McNamara/Troy's most valuable asset. Computers and carpets are assets. I'm a person with feelings, who thinks being shot for both of you... entitles her to an explanation. What is all this drama about? Christian slept with Julia. 17 years ago. Before they were married. Nine months before Matt was born. You do the math. I am so sorry, Sean. Are you all right? Julia and I have started the initial separation phase. You have until we get back from New York to decide which one you'd rather work for. We both know it's not in your character to choose an immoral traitor. Just because Liz and I dip into viciousness every now and then... - doesn't mean we don't love each other. - Stop. I've been with the two of you since you framed your first nickel. So has Linda, and half the people who work here. You're not just dismantling a business. You're dismantling a family. I'm not saying you need to forgive and forget. I am just asking you to consider everything you're giving up. I'm not giving up anything that hasn't already been taken away. We'll be finished with the Rosenberg case next week. Make your decision by then. Where's Annie gonna stay when you're gone? With her. It's only three days. I left lunch and dinner money on your nightstand. No parties and no girls in our bed. My bed. I'm late for school. Matt, please sit down. - I wanna talk to you. - There's nothing to say. You haven't been able to look me in the eye since you found out. You are my father. Not him. Is that what you wanted to hear? Yes. - When's Mom coming back? - She's not. - She wants to. - I don't care. I'm upset with her, too, now... but I want to believe you're a bigger man that this. I'm not. You know... Nobody stopped to ask me, "Matt, are you okay? How are you doing?" That's bullshit. I tried to talk to you. You wouldn't open up. That's right, because retreating, feeling dead and closing off... that I got from you, Dad. What's happened between the three of you... is painful, but we can fix this. Your mother slept with my best friend and you were the result... and I didn't know for 17 years, so stop defending them... And my mother is sleeping in a hotel because you kicked her out... I can hear you crying through the walls at night, so don't you dare scream at me! Have a nice trip. Final boarding call for Flight 714 to New York.</i> Economy? You know when the last time was I flew anything but first class? I could give a shit. The university made arrangements. I called about other flights. None of them would've gotten us there on time. We're already late as it is. Would you mind sitting between us? Do you love her? I'm not gonna play this game with you. You owe me answers. Do you love her? Yes. Like I love you. You're my family. Does she love you? No. Did she come with you? We came together. Do you wanna be with her now? I've thought about it. Do you think Matt looks like you? Yes. This is the captain speaking. I'd like to thank your for flying with us.</i> Flight attendants, please prepare for landing. Thank you.</i> When you masturbate, do you ever think about her? Yes. Did you ask her not to marry me? No. Did you want to? Yes. It's a bare-bones operation here this week.</i> I apologize in advance for the accommodations. - Which are? - Like all our surgical teams... you'll be sharing a room in the dormitories. The university has donated room and board for the doctors and media. I'm sorry. That's not acceptable. With the toy fair convention in town, that's really the only choice... unless you made advance reservations. Your sacrifice of time and amenities will be well worth it. This is an historic surgery. The Rosenbergs are the oldest individuals to undergo this type of procedure. An historic surgery, all right. This'll be the last operation... - of the McNamara/Troy partnership. - We're going to pursue separate interests. - I'm sorry. - Don't be. For the true talent, a split usually proves to be a boon. - Like after the Lennon-McCartney split. - We got Wings. John Lennon, the true visionary, recorded Imagine...</i> - and Double Fantasy, singular classics. - And here we are.</i> Dr. Troy, Dr. McNamara. I'd like you to meet Rose and Raven Rosenberg. Hi. HI. You're late. I'd like to introduce you all to Rose and Raven's mother, Rachel. Hi. I would like to thank you all so much for donating your time and support. I asked Dr. Atherton to call this meeting today...</i> to give you the opportunity to get to know Raven and Rose... the way I know them, to see the things about them... that CAT scans and MRIs don't show. Even though they're physically and emotionally connected... I want you to know my daughters as the individuals they are. Feel free to ask any questions you like. Hi. Dr. Avery Atherton, neurosurgery. I know your nerve endings are separate, but a little I'm unclear...</i> as to how the sensation is interpreted in your brains. For instance, if Raven hurts herself, do you feel it, Rose? We share tissue and bone, not feelings. That's great. Thanks. Dr. Carrie Kozinn, ear, nose and throat. How do you handle your personal needs? I shower every morning. Rose likes her bath at night. How is it that Rose isn't in the shower with you? We put the shower curtain between us. Yes, they're not just lines, it's true. Thank you. Hello. Dr. Sheelen Jeevan, micro-neurovascular surgeon. What if one of you is tired and the other isn't? I go to bed. Yeah. We go to bed. The other one will lay there and read or do something. And the other one will sleep. What about intimate relations? Do you have boyfriends? I had a boyfriend, but we had to break up. Raven couldn't stand him. But Raven is my best friend... so I had to put her feelings first. I see. Thank you. Dr. Christian Troy, plastic surgeon. He's cute. Let me see. We wanted to talk you about what we're going to look like after. How do you wanna look? Sean McNamara, plastic surgeon. As much alike as possible. Have you thought about what it'll be like to be separated? Any fantasies about being alone for the first time? No. No. You must have at least considered it. Dreamed about it? The amazing sense of freedom and release? I had a dream we were once separated... then I got scared, and reached out for Raven, but she wasn't there. So, if you had the choice, you'd stay together? Of course. I hate my cancer. I feel so guilty. It's not your fault, Rose. I'm the one who feels guilty... because I'm not strong enough to handle your chemo. To you, being together looks hard. But it's all we know. I got a call from Kuram. He said you missed both your SAT tutorials this week. So? I pay Kuram $75 an hour for those classes. Don't you mean Dad does? Take your anger out on me and not your future. I don't want you regretting choices you made at an emotional time... for the rest of your life. You are the expert on that. I called you three times yesterday to help me with my move. You want me to help you move out of our house... because you destroyed our family. Who the hell do you think you are? Hey! I am your mother, and I deserve some goddamn consideration. And all of this doesn't change the fact that I love you... and that I was the one up with you and your colic for eight months. I was the one cutting the ends off your peanut-butter sandwiches. I was the one who put my career on hold so I could stay at home with you. And all the while, you knew it was one big lie. I didn't know it then. I don't want to know it now. Don't you see that? No, Mom, I don't see that. Fine. I'm a liar. I'm the worst human being on the planet. But one day... you will realize that I was lying... because I thought it was what was best for you, and for your father. I can't believe anything you say. Okay, I know I came out of your body... but I don't feel any connection to you anymore. Where are you going? I'm going to Ava's. You're seeing her again? Yes. At least I can trust her. She's the only real adult in my life. She's not an adult, Matt. She's a parasite. You have to trust me on this. You don't own the moral high ground anymore, Mom. It's shocking. You'd think these girls would be thrilled about being separated. But they're questioning doing it at all. They're just afraid of having to face life on their own. Or maybe they see that their individuality shines brighter when they're together. Cut the Hallmark bullshit. I'm only in the same room with you... because I need you to be flawless tomorrow. I can't operate on both girls at once. Be professional or shut up. Fine. According to their CTs, Rose doesn't have an eye socket. We're gonna have to build one. We'll need enough tissue to sew the flap over the eye. A prosthetic can be added by someone else during rehabilitation. How far do we inflate the skin expanders when we can't measure her face? If we are short on tissue, we'll end up using free grafts. All we need now is a bong and a Flock of Seagulls album... and we'd be right back to where we started. College was great. Great for you. You had all that free time to party while I carried us through prerequisites. You didn't carry me. - We were a team, same as now. - You have always been reliant on me. And you on me. If not for me, you wouldn't have had a social life. You wouldn't have met Julia. I think you're forgetting how we met. You paid for my tray at the cafeteria, and then begged me... to tutor you up to a B in microbiology. And that tutoring bumped your A-minus to an A. You have never appreciated my contribution to this partnership. We're symbiotic. Guiding me gives you the motivation to excel. You've got talent, but you never would have had the nuts to express it... without me to compare yourself to. I have your ineptitude to thank for my success? You have my 10-inch dick to thank. Surgery is the one place you're more of a man than I am.</i> You need to be better than me, because in your twisted brain... you think that's what keeps Julia. So you work harder, you focus. And that's why with all of your bullshit about carrying me... you've never been able to leave. You couldn't do this without me. - Where are you going? - To study. Alone. - What? - I need your help with Matt. Call his father. Sean won't take my calls. I need you to talk to Matt. He's destroying his future. He's upset. Let him process. That process is gonna land him in Biscayne Community College.</i> You know how important junior year is for college admissions. He hasn't been to his SA Ttutor. God knows if he's going to school, and... he's seeing Ava again. I can't cut Sean's balls off right now. I'll talk to him about it. How is he? Bad. Talk to me about what? Your son. He's not managing. And Julia called you to help? I guess the new era has begun. She said you won't take her calls. Bullshit. She's just playing us off each other. Fine, do it. Raise Matt. I've spent years trying to corral your bad genetics. Let's see if you can do better. Raven? I'm scared. Sing to me. Hush, sweet Rose, don't say a word</i> Sis is gonna buy you a mockingbird And if that mockingbird don't sing All right, doctors, let's make history. How much room do you need? A two-centimeter window. That should be adequate. You've got it. Okay. Let's flip them. All right, on the count of three. One, two, three. 10-blade. She's bleeding through. Let's get suction. I'm opening her. Get a unit of blood. Pressure's dropping. Give her one milligram epi. Start one unit of blood. Unit of whole blood going in. Shit. Suction. Start a dopamine drip. The sagittal sinus is blown. Epi going in. Rose's pressure is dropping. Shit. Is she bleeding, too? No. This doesn't make sense. Flatline. Give atropine. Giving one milligram atropine. Disconnecting. I'm breathing for Raven. One milligram atropine in. Let's get suction. She's losing too much blood. She's 80 over 50. Start dopamine. I've got to open her up. We're losing her. One milligram atropine. Still flatline. She's bleeding out. I'm calling it. Time of death, 3:42 p. m. Heart rate's 16 per minute. Starting compressions. Giving one milligram epi. Good for fusion. One milligram epi in. There's no cranial bleed. This shouldn't be happening. She knows her sister's gone and she's giving up. She's not giving up. She can survive on her own. She can survive. She can survive on her own. Pressure's coming back. 68 over 48. Heart rate's 45 and climbing. You want me to leave the bottle? Just keep pouring it till that's gone. Business or personal? I'm sorry? Classy-looking guy like you ends up drowning in Scotch on West 112th. He's either just lost a big account or his wife's screwing her personal trainer. A little of both. Am I that obvious? Depends on who's looking. Rene. Sean. Can I buy you a drink? Apparently, I now own the whole bottle. We can share. You wanna talk about it? No. I'm tired of talking. Let's just make trivial small talk, then. What's your business, Sean? What do you do? Plastic surgeon. Well, that's pretty cool. Can I get your professional opinion on something? Should I get a boob job? You already did. - You're good. - So are they. - What? - You're very beautiful. - That's just the Scotch talking. - Really. You remind me of somebody. Somebody special I used to know. You're sweet. But you really don't need to work so hard, baby. How much? Depends on what you want. I just wanna make a connection. Hi. Hi. You needed to take a piss, honey? The restroom's right in there. Thanks. What are you doing? Getting laid. What's it look like I'm doing? Where'd you get the weed? I found a dealer in the dorm next door. Who's the girl? A sure thing. - I'm paying. - You're out of control. It's about time, don't you think? - This is payback. - For what? For all the times in school when you had some slut in your bed... and I'd lie there in the dark, listen to you moaning and coming. It made me sick. We had a system. If I had a girl in the room... I'd put the Men at Work album outside against the wall... and you'd know not to come in. It's always about what you want, asshole. You insisted on coming in most of the time... because you had a heavy course load and needed the rest. Pussy. I knew what you wanted. - What did I want? - You wanted to hear me screw. Because it was the closest thing you could get to getting laid. Being linked some way to my conquests, living vicariously through me... is always what's gotten you off. And I could say the same thing about Julia. How it must have killed you that I got what you never could. I did get it. Once. - Three-ways are double. - We're not having a three-way. Why not? Everything else has been. I'll pay, Julia. - My name's Rene. - Not tonight. Tonight it's Julia. Isn't this what you've always wanted? Isn't this your dream? Being part of Julia and I here, not being the outsider looking in? - You're crazy. - And you haven't got the balls. - Maybe I should come back. - No. Stay, Julia. We'll always be together. Is that how you want me to say it? Yes. Yes. Good night. Please come in, Doctor. - How is she? - The same. Hello, Rose. I'm Dr. McNamara. One of your surgeons. All night long, Rose was reaching out... twitching her hand a little bit. Grasping for something. I was sitting beside her, talking to her, telling her everything would be okay. I thought she was reaching out for me but... I know now that she wasn't. I finally told her: "Rose, honey, Raven is in heaven. "Your little sister didn't make it. " After I told her that... her fingers stopped moving. I could feel her soul leave her... just like I felt the breath come into her when she was born. Even if she gets better... and we can take her off this thing... she's not really gonna have any kind of a life, is she? Other than to be studied. Other than to have those damn tabloids try and sneak in and take her picture. No. She'll probably never have the same quality of life on her own. And she didn't want to. They made a living will... right before the surgery. They didn't wanna live if the other one died? Why didn't you tell us that? I told the girls I would, but... I was selfish. I didn't wanna be alone. I kind of suspected that Raven couldn't survive such a brutal separation. She was so small... and weak. She was like... a little dove. But... I thought maybe Rose, even with the cancer... maybe she had a chance because she was just such a fighter. But... even if she got better... a part of her... the biggest part of her, has already died. And I know in my heart... that she wants to die with her. After I do it... will you put them back the way they were... so they can be together forever... as God wanted them to be? Thank you. Go to your sister. Go to your sister. Fly. I have to admit to you, Christian... I am a better doctor because of you. A better doctor with you. I will never forgive you for what happened. I know. I'll never forgive her. And then there's Matt. The best thing this partnership ever produced. You raised him, Sean, not me. I've tried to deny it, Christian... but we raised Matt together. Through good and bad... he was always the best part of both of us.
