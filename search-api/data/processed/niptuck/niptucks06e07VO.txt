about yourself for you to attempt suicide. I was gonna swim until my arms fell off. A father is willing to leave his children fatherless? I'm petitioning for custody of the children. Mother. You're in your 60s. Who is this man? Renaldo is my husband. He always wanted children. All I want is to be a good father to Annie and Conor. Let's get this clear. I--I'm not into men. I'm not a woman. I'm a gay man. If I become Alex, you become a fag? In my mind, if you were Alex, you'd have a bloody nose right now. Turn around. Walk with your back towards us. You see? You know the way things are in here. You have neither the muscle mass nor... the gang affiliations to be a predator. You want me to become somebody's bitch? It's a small price to pay for your life. I'm, uh, Christian Troy, here to see my son, uh, - Matt McNamara. - Sign in. Down the hall, to the left. He's in number 6. I'm Kessler. Your son's doing just fine. He sends his love. Where is Matt? I want to see Matt. Don't worry, I'm taking good care of him. Things were a little rough at first, but he's doing much better since the transfer. - What transfer? - To my cell. He'll only get him into trouble if you do that. If I find out that you hurt him-- Relax. He's much safer now than he was before. As long as he takes care of me... and you decide to help, he'll be fine. You're a plastic surgeon, right? Yes. Great. I may sound a bit old-fashioned, but I think it's the woman's job... to maintain her appearance. Matt's a good-looking kid, nice features, but the one thing he needs... what you can give him... is a nice set of tits. If you're worried the board won't approve the surgery. I've already got Matt speaking to the shrink in here, claiming he wants to be a woman. Papers got filed... There's a precedent for this. You know what? I don't believe that Matt... would agree to any of this. Oh, you wouldn't believe... what he's agreed to since he's been in here. Now look, I'm doing life. I haven't even touched a woman in 16 years. Do you know what that does to a man? How you learn to adapt? I can't go back to being the man I was any more than Matt can. Oh, I mean... if I could help you and, in some other kind of way, I can give you money for an appeal, or, uh, I don't know... organize a hooker or something? You got 48 hours. Your son's a good kid, but he ain't gonna be worth much to... either one of us unless you do what I say. Trust me on that. Nip/Subs Team presents Season 6 - Episode 7 "Alexis Stone II" Original VO: Ladyhawk Corrections & Resynchro VO : Sean When did Annie begin showing signs of depression? I guess it was after we returned to New York, yeah. It was a stressful time for all of us. Why? Because of, uh, Olivia's death, you know? She was an important part of our family. That makes sense. Death, divorce, moving... 3 of the most stressful events in life, and... Conor and Annie experienced all 3... in a very short time, didn't they? Yes. Isn't that exactly what happened, Ms. McNamara? You and their father divorced. You moved them from their home to New York, and then to Los Angeles. You subjected your children to a seemingly... unending barrage of unsettling, horrific events. I'm surprised your daughter didn't try to kill herself... after she reached out in desperation by eating her own hair. Give her a break, Frank. She's falling apart. You think Erica's lawyers are gonna give her a break, Sean? Annie would never commit suicide, Julia. - She knows we love her. - They say it runs in the family. I'm not the one who keeps pulling up their roots... and taking them across country. Cool it, you two. You're suing for joint custody, remember? If you guys are gonna have any chance in hell of getting your kids back, you're gonna have to bury the hatchet and do it together. Julia, it's obvious you're stressed out. You look like you've aged 10 years in the last month. Appearances matter, you guys. We need to look strong... and vibrant to combat Erica's age and experience. 20456. McNamara. Armed robbery. Arrested... My son is being threatened. Well, Dr. Troy, I can assure you... we have zero-tolerance for coercion. You've gotta tell Kessler because um, he didn't get the memo. Well, there's nothing about it in his file. You know, often new prisoners feel a need... to prove themselves by getting into scuffles. I think that you know that there is a law... against 'deliberate indifference' to potential prison rape. Dr. Troy, I am anything but indifferent to your son's welfare. Well, then, you need to move him to a different cell block. Uh, a safer one. - You want him in a safer cell? - Yes Fine. Find me a half-million dollars for some staff. So there's not one guard to every 60 of Kessler's posse, and another 300 for see-through doors on closets... and monitors in the showers, so Kessler's wolves don't attack without being seen. I can manage $10,000. A bribe? A contribution... to prison reform. I hate these. I don't like causing you pain. You heard what the lawyer said. We have to look youthful and stress-free. Whatever it takes, that's my mantra. Joint custody is gonna be a very tough fight. Yeah, but it doesn't mean that we're gonna give up. You're their father. I'm their mother. Sean, I need you. The more united we are, the better our odds. What if we became a real united front? I mean, I gotta get out of that Malibu place. It's become a middle-aged frat house. What if I rented a house and you moved in? Sean, don't go there, please. It's too late for you and me. But we do know how to be friends, all right? And we have a serious common goal here. The lawyer said it. Appearances are everything... and you and I could just take it as it comes. But in the meantime, we get our kids back. What did you say your mantra was? Whatever it takes? Whatever it takes. I didn't think any girl could be... more beautiful than your mother. I was wrong. Thank you, Erica. Renaldo picked this out. Italians rule the world of fashion. Beauty is their second language... followed by food and sex. - I'm gonna go try on the others. - Oh, marvelous. We'll have a fashion show. Hello? Where are the kids? We have a surprise. Oh, you're early. Annie's trying on her new clothes. We've been buying out Rodeo Drive. And Conor's at his first French horn lesson. French horn? Why, he's a little young, isn't he? No. The horn will develop his digital dexterity, and his self-esteem. Well, give me the address. We'll pick him up. We are going house hunting. We're, um, thinking of renting a house... big enough for the whole family. How many times will you repeat the same mistake... without ever learning anything from it? Where's my daughter? Sean, if you really love her, don't lure Annie into a fairy tale that has no real hope of a happy ending. Hi. Is it Thursday already? Yeah, till midnight. Um, sweetheart, we have the whole afternoon together. Awesome. So, since we have all that time together, maybe you can come back in a couple of hours. No. Now. Cara mia, it's ok. Go with Ma and Papa. I'll be here when you come back. Annie, don't do this. Don't make us beg for time with you. Aw, Annie, that dress is gorgeous. Brings out the eyes. Did you notice? No. They never do. Sweetie, we noticed--you do, you look beautiful. Whatever. Look, just 2 hours. We're in the middle of a photo shoot. The camera. It love her face. Ok. Yeah, 2 hours. We'll come back. Um, have fun. Thanks. This is a closed shoot. Miss McNamara says no press. Sorry. So Sean... I send you copies? I can't believe I'm gonna lose Conor and Annie. There's no way a judge is gonna rule... against the mother and the father of those 2 kids. When we went to pick them up, Annie said she'd rather stay with her grandmother. Oh, you know she doesn't mean that, Sean. I mean, she's a teenager, right? Erica probably bribed her with a pony or a Mini-Cooper or something. It's not going to last long-term, trust me. You talk with Matt? How's he holding up? He's fine. He's doing fine. Look, he's not the one I'm worried about. I'm worried about you. All right? You can't give up on yourself again. You need to fight back, be aggressive. McNamara. Get your personals, you're going on vacation. I'm what? You're being transferred. Oswald will take you to your new cell. Get it moving. Somebody must luuvve you. Here you go. Is it just me in here now? Yep. Your own bachelorette pad. 'nighty night. What? You didn't think I'd come... to the house warming party? After all, I did for you. You gotta help me. Please. You gotta help me. Please. Come on. No, Denny. Help me. Please. Hey, stranger. Alex. Wow, look at you. How's the healing going? Well, the swelling's gone down a little bit more... than I wanted, if you know what I mean. Well... Give it some time. I don't know. I go into bars and... everyone automatically sees a post-op transsexual. Everybody knows that I used to be a woman, and it's pretty hard to explain... to them that I was a man first. The only guys I seem to attract... are the limp-wristed type. Well, as Alexis you were into straight guys and switching... teams and going for the gays could be, uh, problematic, I guess. My situation's a little more complicated than that. Hey, uh, I'm looking for someone... I was told worked this shift. You're lookin' at him, pal. It's just me tonight. Ok, uh, well, maybe you can tell me when she'll be around. Her name's Alexis. That hot boy helped me realize something... I'm definitely gay, but I only like straight guys... or at least the guys that want everyone... to think they're straight. Right, so you like guys on the down low. What do you want me to do about that? Meet me half-way. Give me breast implants. I'll grow out my hair. I'll start dressing as a woman again... You want to be a chick-with-a-dick. I mean, can't you just make up your mind? That's a very offensive phrase, Dr. Troy. In the trans world, that's the equivalent of... calling an African-American the 'n' word. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Maybe I changed my body as an attempt to be accepted. But I finally realized that... I've always been the same person on the inside... and i'm very proud of that. Giving me boobs again isn't gonna change who I am. It's just gonna give me a chance to be... with the people that I need to be with. How did you get in here? Yeah. He wouldn't let me sign in as a visiting physician. You, um, break anything? Any internal injuries? Can you do me a favor? Get me a sip of water. They've got me kind of shackled here. Sure, yeah. I got, uh, 4 fractured ribs, a mild concussion--other than that, I don't know. Good? Well, maybe I should talk to the warden again... and get this guy transferred or something. You wanna really help me out? Of course. Then do the operation. I'm serious. I know you're scared. - I... I understand that... - No, you can't. You can't possibly understand what I'm going through. I'm not gonna be safe anywhere now... At least before, I had protection, but without Denny, I'll be like... fresh meat thrown to a bunch of lions. Can't you press charges against him? I mean, at least then you get protection, right? There's no protection in here. If I press charges, and if Denny finds out, there's not just gonna be a beating next time, Christian. You put pec implants in guys. That's not the same thing, and you know it. Yeah, well, I don't want to die, either. Operation or not. Denny's gonna have his way with me, ok? I know that and you know that. So, unless you want to visit me... in the morgue next time, you do it. Wow, look at this one. It's just 3 blocks from the beach. Look at those views. See? That could be Conor's room. That could be Annie's, and this could be ours. Isn't that a little pricey? Especially if it's only temporary. Oh, come on. Sit down. We need to stay positive, now. Santa Monica has a great school district. This place is already furnished, and you always said you wanted a yard with a pool. Now, you can get it. Well, that was when the kids were young. What? You've lost your fetish for skinny dipping? I'm not gonna be doing that now. Why not? Those days are over? Oh, so is that your plan? I just think this would be a great place for all of us. The family. And we agreed, if we're gonna make this work, we have to commit ourselves 100%. Financially and emotionally. Whatever it takes? We need to get that out of the way sooner or later, huh? Hey, you're not gonna get all weird on me now, are you? I'm just nervous about losing the kids, that's all. I don't want to make any wrong moves. We're not gonna lose the kids because we had sex. I just don't want to take any more chances. That's why we need to play dirty... just like Erica. - What? - I'm gonna show you something. What is this? Open it. Cocaine. Christian got it for me. He knows a dealer at some strip club. If you get busted with that, they book you for distribution. Carries a mandatory 10-year sentence. What the hell are you doing with this? It's not mine. It's Renaldo's... at least it will be after I plant it on him and call the police. Are you insane? Are you forgetting what that asshole did... to me with the camera? The whole set-up? We can't play by the rules anymore. Julia, there's too much at stake. Sean. You're risking everything. Now hold on a second... Just give this to me... Jesus. That cost me 2 grand. Fine, we'll have to rent a smaller house. Renaldo? Amore. Renaldo? Are you hiding something? Oh, no, no. A surprise for later. Surpresa? Well, I think I'd like my surprise now. In the moonlight with music... - Renaldo. - Amore. Show me. Later... In a romantic moment What have you got in your pocket? We weren't doing anything. I mean, you know, he would pose me, to make me look hot. How hot? Uh, did he ever touch you in an inappropriate way? I never touched her. Do you think I'm a monster? Get out. Erica, are you mad at me because... he spends more time with me than you? Don't be ridiculous. It's just if... anything ever happened between you... that felt uncomfortable. You'd tell me, wouldn't you? You have to tell me, Annie. Didn't you hear me? I never touched her. - You're the only one I love. - I'm the only one. You were thinking of me while you were masturbating... into my granddaughter's panties? I want you out of this house, out of my life. And if you don't get out right now, I'm calling the police. My fantasy, it's still in my head. Yours? Standing before you. Who's the sick one? I ask you. Absolutely. No, I agree... I asked Annie to take Conor to the beach so... we could talk. I've been to court. They're ours. Annie and Conor. She gave up custody. Why, Erica? Why would you do a kind and decent thing like that? I've left Renaldo. Did you catch him playing with someone from his own generation? We never appear as old to ourselves as we do to others. "As we age, we hover between fool and sage." Oh, come on, mother, that's not true. You were never a sage. Julia, I love my grandchildren. If I thought I was endangering them in any way... Endangering them, how? I didn't mean "endangering". We live in a hyper-sexualized culture. Naturally, the adolescent delights in her... newly discovered ability to control through her sexuality. - Are you talking about Annie? - Did something happen? No, no. I'm positive. Did Renaldo touch her? Did he? I found him with...her underpants, ejaculating. Get out of here. And you better buy Renaldo a one-way ticket... back to whatever hole he crawled out of. Are you sure about this? You're not gonna change your mind and... decide something else a month from now? I'm still me, even if my sexual identity is,... well, fluid. Those, I mean. They're just silicone bags. They can take 'em out again, right? Right. Lizzie? Ok, count backwards for me. 10 blade. Let's raise up our lady-boy and... see if her boobies are even. How long will it be before I can take off the bandages? Christian. Christian. How long will it be before I can take off the bandages? Christian? 4 to 5 days... after the swelling and soreness goes down, you can come back in and I'll take off the bandages. The last time, I was showing off... my new titties within a week. Then again, I was on estrogen and progestin. Progestin would stop me from having an erection, right? Warren wouldn't like it if I killed my libido. What did she say? I told her I wasn't doing the surgery. Do you have any idea what you're doing to me? Yes. I'm offering you a better solution. Uh, I put all your meds in your make-up bag. Mother, it's a 12-hour flight to Milan. What if your arthritis acts up and you need a Darvocet or something? Oh, of course. I'm just not thinking. I seem to have been doing a lot of that these days. No one tells you how to grow old. One day you discover you can't be who you are anymore. Inside you still see yourself as... brilliant, dazzling, beautiful. But the mirror makes a fool of you. No one is ever over 40 in their dreams. That's your cab. Julia, I can't undo what I've already done, but... I can face up to it, and tell the truth, and ask you to forgive me. I am not here to forgive you, Mother. I am here to get rid of you, to pack you up... and tell you never to contact me... or any member of my family again. Think about what you're saying. Can you live with that decision? I can't possibly live without it. You're dead to me, Mother. When I close that cab door, I'm shutting your coffin. Let's go. We don't want you to miss your plane. Honey, I'm home. Lockdown 11C. I got you a little something. Try it on. It's not really gonna fit. Put it on and hurry up. Ooh, I like it. Looks so good. Turn around. Damn it. I don't know what the hell is wrong. It's ok. It happens to a lot of guys. You keep your mouth shut. If you'd got the titties like I told you, there wouldn't have been any problem. My dad said it's gonna take a little more time. The warden still has to approve it. Oh, and she will. You can count on it. Do you... do you want a ho ho? That always makes you feel better. Yeah, ok. A little chocolaty goodness would go down right now. It's ok. I've got it all right here. You're sweet. - Shit. - What the hell are these? What are you doing with these? Provera. They give this shit to rapists. It's chemical castration. Jesus, how long have you been giving me this stuff? You think just because I can't get hard... that I won't bang that tight little succulent ass of yours? Take off your god damn pants. I'll teach you to mess with me. No. Bag check. Is this your bag? Huh? yes. May I ask what it is you're looking for? What's this? I have no idea. It gives me great peace of mind to see... how thorough you are, but my plane is due to board. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used... against you in a court of law. Do you understand? What is this pertaining to? The half-kilo of cocaine we found in your purse, Miss. Uh, I put all your meds in your make-up bag. It's a 12-hour flight to Milan. What if your arthritis acts up... and you need a Darvocet or something? You have the right to consult an attorney... before speaking to the police, and have... an attorney present during questioning,... now and in the future.
