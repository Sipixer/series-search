really have one. I do have one, and it belongs to you. It always has. Turn around, walk with your back towards us. Your son's doing just fine. He sends his love. Where is matt? I want to see matt. Don't worry, I'm taking good care of him. You gotta help me! Please! Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mrs., uh... Special agent Thomas. I'm from the district attorney's office. So what can we do for you? I want you to suck the fat out of a murdering piece of scum... so we can kill him. Wesley Clovis. He's due to be executed in 2 weeks. "His weight increases the risk that the correct dose of thiopental... cannot be determined and he will therefore not be properly anesthetized." Bullshit. Some kid over at the public defender's office wants to play tv lawyer... and he throws the eighth amendment at us. "Experts agree if the first drug doesn't work,... the execution could be excruciating." It took 3 hours for that sick bastard to rape and torture... a 17-year-old girl... and now he's using cruel and unusual punishment to get off? Come on. - Court's never gonna buy this. - Really? Now why is that? Because it's unjust? Come on, doctors, we live by the rule of law. And the law states that execution by lethal injection... be of sufficient dosage to quickly and painlessly cause death. But someone Clovis' size, we can't absolutely guarantee that. The only way to make sure that the execution goes properly... is if he sheds some of that blubber, pronto. So you picked us to give him liposuction and a tummy tuck, out of all of the plastic surgeons in the state? In exchange for your services, the D.A.'s willing to shorten your son's prison term. - He could be up for parole in... - No, no, no. If you want our help... Matt gets out now. Period. Christian... Well, I believe I can convince the district attorney to consider your offer. We need to discuss this, if you don't mind, in private. Oh, sure. Listen... Sooner or later, Clovis is fish food. Now the only issue is... whether he gets to stuff his face for another 15 years... while his appeal winds its way through the courts. Your son's still young, doctor. Isn't his life worth more than that of an unrepentant murderer? Nip/Subs Team presents Season 6 - Episode 10 "Wesley Clovis" Original VO: honeybunny Corrections & Resynchro VO : Sean What's this? This, my bombay baby, is a chimango martini, One of my new brilliant inventions. Mmm. It's good. Where's Wilber? He had another little accident. Jesus. And I'm spending what, 275 a session, which I can't afford, on this charlatan kiddie shrink, and he's still pissing in his bed. You know what they do together? Do you have any idea what they do together? They play candyland. Candyland! Honey, he's fine. I changed his sheets, I read him a story. He's sleeping like a little lamb. I want you to enjoy your drink because I'm serving you dinner. Ok. What's going on, Kimmie, huh? You tired of driving that old camry, you got your eyes on a porsche or something? I am expanding my culinary horizons. It's called making an effort, Christian. I'm pregnant, Christian. I don't want any more kids, Kimber. I can't afford any more kids, ok? Emotionally or financially. I want things to get easier, not harder. I understand. But sometimes... Unexpected things happen for a reason, and you love kids. I'm 45 years old, ok? I already got 3 kids. Frankly, my dear,... Parenting is not your long suit. You know, that grandchild of mine, she already is showing signs of becoming a world-class spoiled brat. Come here. Come here. You just have to make up your mind. A check for its schooling, or me. It's not an "it", Christian. You can't have both. Why can't you just say you'll sleep on it? Please? You cooked this shit for nothing. Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy sweet sixteen, Amy and Tina... Thank you, Dr. Mcnamara, That's enough. You can stop the singing. And can you lose the hats? We're not babies. We look ridiculous. That's 'cause mom keeps treating us like we're four. I know. You know, amy popped her cherry when she was 12... and I've been having an affair with my homeroom teacher... for almost 6 weeks. We're not babies. He's gonna miss having that rhino schnozz up his ass. - Ok, that's enough. I'll take that. - We about ready here? Let's count back from 100. Ok. 100, 99, 98... Good morning, Christian. - So glad you could join us. - Yeah. What's so freakin' good about it? Well, besides the celebration of the Krumholtz twins' sweet sixteen, I slept much better last night once I realized... we're not going to give lipo to Mr. Clovis. The deal's off? - Why'd they change their mind? - They didn't. I did. I called special agent Thomas this morning and I told her... we are not interested. You'd rather see your son rot in prison than help fry a child murderer? If anyone gets wind that we gave lipo to a man just so he could be executed, we're going to be doing much worse than two for one birthday nose jobs. You're such a selfish bastard, do you know that? You're more worried about your solid gold reputation... than you are about your own son. Tell you what... You can be the one to tell him. Oh! Jesus! Is everything in this goddamn place expired? Your man thong's on too tight? You've been in a foul mood all day. Kimber's pregnant. Congratulations. - Is it yours? - Yes, of course it's mine. It's bullshit, that's what is. She wants to keep it. I mean, can you believe the balls on that chick? You don't get it, do you? That's the only way she thinks she can hold onto you. - She already has me. - Nobody has you. We can see you, we can talk to you. But you don't let anybody in. It's the only guarantee that Kimber has that you'll stick around. - Hey, dad. - Hi! So, they let everyone have full contact with family now? Are you kidding me? No. But since you're doing the operation on Wesley, they've been treating me a lot better in here. Really? Yeah, you have no idea, man. You saved my life. Look, when I get out of here, I promise, I'm going to bust my ass to turn things around, ok? You're gonna see. I owe you that much. Matt... I've decided I'm not going to do the surgery. I can't operate on a man just so he can be put to death. I'm sorry. I wanted you to hear it from me first. I thought--I thought you agreed so that I could be released. No. And it still doesn't change what I'm being asked to do, which is compromise my ethics as a doctor. Your ethics?! You take an oath... when you dedicate yourself to medicine, And the basis of that thing I've built my life on is first, do no harm. I can't go against everything I stand for... and risk my reputation right now, even if it means keeping you here. So what you're saying is, that pedophile, that child rapist, means more to you then your own son. No, that is not what I'm saying. No, I get it, man. You don't give a shit about me. You haven't for a long time. I told you, I'm happy to help with your appeal. My appeal? I don't need an appeal. What I want is to get the hell out of here, and now you're telling me I can't... because you won't do some stupid surgery you do a hundred times a week. I'm tired of always being asked to betray my beliefs... because of your bad decisions. How about the fact that you belong here? You son of a bitch! You are dead to me! You hear me? You are dead to me. I don't ever want to see you in here again! Don't ever come back, Sean! You are dead to me! You are dead! We're good? Ok. Let's get this over with, shall we? Is this gonna hurt? I don't like pain. It makes me dizzy. No. It's not gonna hurt. How about that girl you murdered? Think she liked pain? Think she got a little dizzy? I didn't kill her. That's not what the jury thought. Or the appeals court, or the governor. They... they're all wrong. - Because I didn't do it. - Come on, Wes. She complained about you peeping in her windows. They found your boot print in her apartment, in her blood. Well, I shouldn't have peeped. I shouldn't have peeped, but I didn't kill her. You know what, sling blade, that old-timey "I didn't do nothing" hick shit just don't work for me. I came home and her door... was open, and I looked inside to see if... she was ok. She was a nice girl. Did you know dead bodies, They don't look like they do on... on tv. They look... rubbery. Like a picture, you know. No soul. I got scared and I ran away. I know I should... I know I shouldn't have. I know I should have called the police. I know I messed up. - But I didn't kill her. - Tell it to your priest. I've been telling everyone. For 15 years. No one's listened. Doesn't matter anymore. Done fighting. Time for... me to go. Then I guess I'm doing you a favor. You're welcome. Do you... Do you think dying hurts, doc? For you? Yeah. I think it hurts forever. What the hell is he doing in my examine room? Standard pre-op. If the surgery is going to be here and... I'm sucking 150 pounds of fat out of this guy, then I need state of the art equipment. We're not doing this surgery! We're not. I am. For my son. I'll sue you, and I'll win. Try me. And I'll get a court order to stop you from doing the operation... until the case is settled. Whoo! Come on, kimmy, huh? Let's toast us. I'm not drinking, I'm pregnant. Oh, come on, a little champagne is not gonna hurt. Just a little bit. I'm not drinking, Christian, I'm pregnant. And what are we toasting, anyways? You being a complete asshole and not caring about anybody but yourself? I've been thinking long and hard about the two of us. Oh, we are not young anymore, you know? Like we used to be, like we were when we first met. I've had several life lessons Since then, and I know you have too, but... We always keep, phhtt, you know... coming back to each other. You know, no matter what. I've never had a connection with somebody the way that I do with you. I know that you feel the same way about me. We've seen the best of each other and the worst, and when we get between the sheets, it's... It's magic. I want you there when I go to sleep at night, and I want you there... when I wake up in the morning. Will you marry me? Wow, it's beautiful. It's vintage, baby. Just like us. One small, caveat, sweetie pie. Yeah? No babies. Dr. Mcnamara? The, uh, the victim's father's here. When they told me you refused to operate on Clovis, I was pretty damn mad. I know I had to meet you face to face so you could at least... hear my side of the story. With all due respect, Mr. Martel, I don't need to. I already know the details of your daughter's death, and... it does not change my position as a doctor. It's been 15 years since... Clovis was given the death penalty. 15 years. My daughter was only 17 when he killed her. You know they... They say when a family member gets cancer, it's like... the whole family gets cancer. Imagine what it's like... when your baby girl is brutally murdered. Would it be all right if I used your phone? I'm sorry, Wesley, but it's a little late. I just want to order a pizza. Please? I'm really hungry. Look, please? I reported you to police for looking in my window. Please just leave me alone. He treated her like an animal. Look, Mr. Martel, I... I can imagine what you've been through. No, you can't. My wife died of heart disease. The stress of waiting, of not knowing if or... when we could put an end to this. Now it's my turn. Chordoma. Base of the spine. I know a surgeon at St. Joseph's, uh, a specialist in bone cancer who's had a lot of success... with gamma ray and laser technology... No thanks, doc. I... I'm... I'm happy to leave. I just... don't want to go before he does. So I can face my daughter... and tell her that we... we punished the man who took your life. You were given... justice. Justice, baby girl. - Hi. - Hey. Am I too early? No, no, I'm running late. Come in. Heh. Good. - How are you? - Good. Nice to see you. You know, I was so surprised to get a call. - Yeah? - Yeah. Just surprised? Well, and happy. Excited. Ok, I'm gonna be right back, all right? All right. Ah. You did some redecorating, huh? Yeah, I got rid of some stuff. Uh, I read this article somewhere that said... you shouldn't have anything in your home if it's not... beautiful or useful. So I'm just... trying to live like that. I like it. Makes sense. Hey, you know, I was thinking we should check out this uh... new mediterranean restaurant. A patient of mine said that it's supposed to be unreal. Well... I hope you can cancel those reservations. What? How far along are you? What? Your breasts are swollen, your nipples are darker... and you have mild acne from the progesterone increase. I guess... 7 weeks? Six. Well... We know it's not mine, then. And yet... You called me over here to have sex with you so you could, what... Make me think I was the daddy? Why? Because I can barely manage one. A single mother with 2 kids? I'm not gonna find a man again. And I can't do this on my own, Mike. And you and I, we were really good together. We were. I am so, so sorry. Yeah. Me, too. And I thought... you'd be a really good dad. Do you think you could possibly... forgive me for this? I have a better idea. Marry me. Did you see that swarm of news helicopters? Whoa! Glad you changed your mind. The guns are gonna have to remain outside the O.R. They've all been soaked in... the hydrogen peroxide gas-plasma sterilizer for 14 hours, Dr. Mcnamara. They're completely germ-free. Who are you? Dr. Neal. I'm here to look over Dr. Cruz's shoulder, double check her numbers. Yeah, god forbid I make a mistake and Mr. Clovis never wakes up. My... my lawyer said this is costing $300,000. That's a lot of money. Everyone loses because of what you did, Wesley. Why don't you just kill me then, and just get it over with? That's not my job, Mr. Clovis. Count back... from a hundred for me. 99, 98... Jesus, that lunch was disgusting. How come you ain't fighting to sit on the crown? 'cause I didn't eat it. Mcnamara, grab your shit, you're getting transferred. I don't like releasing inmates before they're rehabilitated. I'm getting out of here? I know I'll see you in here again. No, no, no,... there's no need for that. And who's going to be driving you home today? Me. We can't let you risk driving after the procedure. Ok, well, I don't really have anyone that I can call, so... I'm sure you know someone who could take off an hour and a half. Hey. It's kimber. Come on, come on, I got you. Come on! Come on! Thanks. I had it, though. No sense killing yourself when you're almost a free man, Matt. Do I know you? Jeremiah. What, uh, makes you so special, Matt? You're the one they gonna let go after they execute that boy, right? So tell me, what do you do to deserve a second chance like that? My dads did the surgery on Wesley. I'm not talkin' about that. I'm asking you... How come you can get away with murder? What? Wesley's not the one who killed that girl. Well, they did 2 trials, Jeremiah. You talked to him? That boy's so simple, he couldn't figure out... how to murder a hot dog. He just in the wrong place at the wrong time, that's all. How do you know this? Were you there? No. I spent 11 years in a cell with the man who was. So you're saying somebody confessed to you. Bragged was more like it. He told me all the gory details, too. He was a sick bastard. That doesn't make any sense. You spent your life behind bars like I have, nothin' makes sense. You know how many innocent men there are on death row... just 'cause they couldn't afford to write a lawyer? Please. Let me ask you something... Why are you telling me this? Why haven't you said anything to the warden? What would that get me? They'd just tell me I'm crazy. You the one that need to be told. You see, freedom is a heavy burden, And seeing as how... god saw fit to give it to you, it's only fair that... you have to pay the price. Tomorrow, Wesley's blood will be on your hands. Hi. - Thanks for coming. - No problem. Sorry they're so ridiculous with the rules. Oh, it's no problem. I know it's weird I called you. But at the end of the day, I just feel... more comfortable with you. I mean, you've been... through this with him. Can I ask you a personal question? Do you regret... your abortion? Sometimes. I mean, sometimes I think it would have been nice to have a son, no matter how imperfect. Be nice to have someone to love and care for. Maybe then I wouldn't have married Christian. You know, that's a chapter I could have... easily done without. You must think I am completely insane for doing this for him. You know, I didn't come here to advise you. I just... I came to drive you home. Yeah, I understand. Listen... At the time, I just... I didn't think I could raise a child by myself. And I knew that if I had a... down syndrome baby with Christian, it would be... by myself. Yeah. But the thing is is that I... I wanted to have this baby so bad, and I begged him. I mean, I begged him. And I even thought, maybe like you, you know, I could just do it on my own. And then, I even entertained the idea of... Marry you? Yeah. We're both not getting any younger. Everybody has got baggage. Divorce, kids. The important thing... is that you find the right person... that you want to spend the rest of your life with. But in the end, it's Christian that I just can't live without. And I just want to be with him, Liz. I want to marry him. I just want to spend the rest of my life with him, I always have. And that's what I want more than anything, even more than this baby. And I know it sounds awful... No, it doesn't. And I know, You have got bad case of Christian. You got it worse than any of us. I know. God. The thing is, I know that I have screwed up so bad with Jenna. I mean, it's painful for me. So I guess I just wanted Christian to see that I could be... Kimber Henry? Hi. Ok. I've got to do this. You know it's going to be ok. Right? I mean, who knows? In a year, Christian might want another baby. Right? Maybe. Yeah. Well, You are really a strong woman, Liz. I can see why Christian married you. - All right. - All right. I'll be back. I'll be right here. - Ok. - Ok. - Hi. - This way. Here, this will keep you nice and warm. Your fever's going down. That's good, huh? Why don't you get some sleep? Ok. Oh, sweetness, listen, listen. You're gonna be fine. And when you feel better, it's not gonna seem so bleak, ok? Girl scout promise. Get some rest. Welcome home. Lizzie. To what do I owe the pleasure? I was helping kimber. She's not feeling so well, but I think she's finally gone to sleep. Would you just stop speaking in code? Just tell me what's going on. I drove her home from the hospital. After she had... the procedure. So she got rid of it? Yeah. She got rid of "it". Wow. Wow. Well, I guess that means I'm getting married. Well, you know, I guess I should, ahem, go congratulate the misses. Oh, no, please. Don't. There were complications. What kind of complications? A perforation. - Her cervix was retroverted. - Lizzie... Stop it with this. Just please, say it. She can't have any more children. Not that that matters to you, Because you don't want any more, Right? Now I know she's no mother Teresa, but she cannot have any more babies. So if at some point in the future, you decide to leave her, put that little piece of information into the equation... as a reminder of just what she gave up to be with you. Why did she come to you instead of coming to me? Why? Because she was scared, and I had done it before. And because I was not the one who told her to do it. Did you come to tell me the deal's off? What? No! We come to bring you this. Can't have you heading out on your first day of freedom... in the same rags you came in here in. We checked with the warden. You can take that back to your cell... and change while you wait for your release. - Thanks. - You're welcome! So this means Wesley's going to be... In an hour. They figured out a way to do it without pain, then? That's why we're here. To make sure the doses are correct, to answer any questions... before they put him to sleep. What made you change your mind? I didn't change my mind. I always thought Wesley should pay for what he did. Just like anyone who commits a crime should. All right, sean, come on. He's paid plenty for his mistakes. Haven't you? I mean, it's not like you murdered or raped anybody, like that asshole. I know you're going to be a good boy, aren't you? - Yeah, that's right. - You promise? You see? He's gonna be a changed man. Wait. There's something I need to tell you guys first... about Wesley and the execution. What? He's told people... What? That if he ever gets out of here, he'll do it again. He's a very sick man, And you should have no remorse for what you're doing. And I'm sorry for what I said to you. I know you were just trying to do the right thing. You're my dad and I love you. I don't want to see this. You don't have a choice. It's part of the deal. We're the only ones who know how much fat we sucked out of him. They want to stop murderers, they should televise this shit. If they want to abolish the death penalty, they should televise it. We shouldn't have done this. No regrets, all right? I mean, come on. This guy was going to die anyway. And now your son loves you again, right? It's a good thing. Besides, we've seen people die before. Hell, we threw them in the swamp. This is painless and justified. You trying to convince me or yourself? The prisoner wants to see you two. Is it supposed to hurt this bad? We haven't administered the drugs yet, Wesley. No, I mean the surgery. I was up puking all night this night. I couldn't eat my last meal. Didn't they give you the pain meds? I asked about them,... but they said it would interfere with... with the stuff. One of you want to double check my numbers? I've never seen this much sodium thiental prescribed. That's kind of the point. Can't we just give him some versed to calm him down? The barbiturates won't be affected... This isn't Beverly Hills. The incision's infected. You didn't see that? Guys, as long as the numbers in the file are correct, it's all gonna be fine. Yeah, they're fine. Time to go. Tell me it's not going to hurt. Tell me it's not going... It's not going to hurt. Wesley, look at me. It's not going to hurt, I promise, ok? You're just gonna go to sleep. Mr. Clovis, the governor of California has denied your final request for clemency. Do you have any final words? Calling it at 3:17 P.M. Can we get our son back now? Yeah. I'll go finish his paperwork. It's all over now, Mr. Martel. I guess so. It doesn't feel like it,
