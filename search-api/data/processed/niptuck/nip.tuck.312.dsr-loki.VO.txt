And... and we also do aromatherapy, thai, shiatsu, and hot stone massage. And... we just received a 4-star review in Spalife Magazine. Really? Imagine--an entire magazine devoted to spas. Well, it's not just spas. It's, um, you know, skin care, beauty treatments-- Alana, dear, out of over 600 muscles in the human body, so far you've only done one. Um, just excuse us a minute, please. She may be the best in Miami. In New York she'd be lucky to work at the Y. Mother, you see those hot tubs? Go soak yourself. Sweetheart, I'm thrilled you've found something that gratifies you. It's unbelievable. You've managed to turn annihilating me into an art form. If you'd let me get you the settlement you deserved, you'd be halfway through your second year at med school. Before long you'd have had your own practice. And bought a spa. And hired some other desperate divorcee to run it. What time did you say your plane was? 7:00. I moved it from 4:00 so we'd have time to spend together. Well, I think you should get the earlier flight. Darling, be proud of your spa. Stop looking to me for approval. You shouldn't need it anymore. I don't need it! It's just that it would be nice to know what it feels like before either of us dies! Ok. There are specialists who deal in separation/individuation issues. - If you're interested-- - Ok, just get out! Get out and get your cold, judgmental, Michael Kors wearing ass out of my spa now! Ok? Just take the earlier flight! Erikson defines love as that which promotes another's growth. Oh, you want to see me grow, mother? Get the hell out of my life! Thar she blows. Mrs. Winant is waiting. I'm not sure what I should tell her. Tell her that Dr. Costa was an hour and a half late. Give her another valium and tell her to relax. She's already had 20 milligrams. You sure you want to give her any more before she goes under? Would you like to finish for me? What? Well, I guess while I was oversleeping, someone went out and got themselves a license to practice medicine. Look, I didn't mean to interfere. I-- Honey, unless you have an M.D. after your name, stick to your facials and fluffy pillows and leave the medical procedures to me. Don't call me honey, Quentin. I happen to be your boss. Oh, I've been a bad boy. You gonna fire me or paddle my booty? I'll tell her you'll be with her as soon as you can. Thanks... boss. Wow. And I thought this was the largest ass I'd ever seen. Excuse me, I'm looking for information on flight 237. My mother was on that plane. I'm sorry, there's no information at present. If you'd like to-- What about survivors? Are there any survivors? Ma'am, we're asking all family members to gather at the hotel lobby right across the street. If you'd like transportation, there's a shuttle leaving right now. May I have your attention? Flight 237 ran into difficulties on takeoff, hitting the roof of a house, then crashing into a nearby street. The aircraft's body was divided into two parts. Now, the word from the crash site is that there are some survivors. Thank god. Who are they? We are not releasing those names yet. But in the interim, please fill out the yellow identification forms and return them to the podium. Thanks. I've gone through 2 packs already. Natalie Holden. My mother's on that flight. Julia McNamara. Mine is, too. We flew her out here business class. She was going to New York to see her sister. They just had to see a broadway show. I'm sorry. I'm running my mouth. I do that when I'm nervous. No, please, it helps hearing you talk. Jewelry, watches. Are they kidding? I can't even remember what earrings I have on. Well, what about a wedding ring? Oh, please. She wouldn't be seen dead wearing... Mine never went anywhere without her silver cross and her 2004 world series necklace. Your mom's a baseball fan? Nah. She's just an ex-catholic who believes god speaks to us through the Red Sox. Well, what's god trying to say? Miracles happen. Believe in someone enough and they'll surprise you. Blood type. I used to know that. Ma's O-negative. She said the best part about being a universal donor was that she could never be so broke that she couldn't give something to the needy. She sounds like a special person. Yeah. She  stood by me when no one else would. I'd look into her eyes and see myself as she saw me... smart, successful. Beautiful. If someone does that long enough you begin to believe them. Um... yeah, well, I just, uh... No,  I mean... my mother and I, we... It doesn't matter. She knows you love her. Yeah. Uh, I better finish this. Wait here. I'm gonna go get us a fresh pack of tissues. WCNU breaking news. Viceroy Airlines, flight 237 had engine trouble on takeoff and has crashed. We have early reports of survivors but no names have been released. Due to fire and debris causing road closures, a triage center has been set up at dakota high school, 2 blocks from the site of the crash - to avoid potentially fatal transport delays. - Hi. It's me. God, I wish you were there. Something awful's happened. Julia? I'm here. What's wrong? The chances for survival are no worse at a triage center than at an E.R. These are professionals, specially trained in dealing with crisis situations. Now, you sure you want to look for your mother? You might find something you wish you hadn't. I can call you. No. I can deal with what I know much better than what I don't. Besides, there's a chance that I may still be able to find her. It's a small chance, Jules. You know that. She wasn't supposed to leave until 7:00. We had a fight. I told her to get an earlier plane and get the hell out of my life. Those can't be the last words I ever say to her. Thank you for coming. It says something, doesn't it, that you were the only one I thought to call? I'm glad you did. Sorry, emergency personnel only. Dr. Sean McNamara. It got a call saying you could use some help. I don't have you on the list. - What's the problem? - I don't have him on the list. Who gives a shit? We need doctors. Check his license and send him in. Ok. Go. Go. Dr. McNamara of McNamara and Troy. I'm a plastic surgeon. Good. We can sure as hell use one in there. It's a barbecue. Dr. Russell Marcus. I'm sorry, authorized medical personnel only. She's my assistant. Are you an R.N.? I had a year of premed. Wait outside, please. My mother was on that plane. I'm sorry. He's right, Julia. It's crazy to think you can handle this. Take the car keys, go back to the hotel. Don't tell me what I can handle, Sean, please. Not now. You coming, doctor? Not without her. Follow me. We divided the gymnasium into 4 areas. Red tags need immediate attention--severe bleeding, shock, open wounds. Yellow--serious but not immediately life-threatening-- burns but no respiratory distress, spinal injuries. Greens can wait--cuts, bruises, contusions. Don't worry about the ones in the black area. They're not going to make it. Palliative measures only. Maybe you can hold some hands. Come on, doctor. Masks and gloves are on the table. Let's go! Stop! I think that's my mother. No. It's not her. Please, help me. I'm so cold. I'm so cold. I'll get you a blanket. My baby... I don't feel her kicking. How far along are you? 7 months. Please... is my baby ok? There. Can you feel that? It's happening again. Yes. I felt it that time. Do you know how to replace an I.V. bag? - I think so. - Good. Come with me. Her face is the least of it. She's in D.I.C. That's where the blood clots throughout the body but not at the initial injury site. So the body responds by triggering clot-dissolving mechanisms which cause the patient to bleed to death. I'm sorry, doctor. I didn't realize that you-- I'm not... a doctor. So all you can do is force fluids and keep her comfortable? Exactly. Thank you. Got any olive oil? To  prevent scarring. My grandmother used it all the time. Would antiseptic cream do? Rub some on my face, will you, honey? It hurts like hell. Fractured my pelvis. Did they tell you? Fractured  pelvis. I mean, I'm 68. I was bound to break a hip one of these days. You're supposed to say, "you don't look 68." Relax, honey. It's just a little antiseptic cream, not surgery. That's lucky for you. Listen. Do you have a mirror? I left my purse in the car. Everybody's out of mirrors today. How come no one will let me see my face? I mean... I was no Angie Dickinson to start with. They're just a little backed up. That's all. Of course. Vanity, thy name is Helen. Shame on me. I survived. I should be on my knees thanking god. Well, Helen, why don't we work our way from the neck up? Kill me, please. It's important that you try not to move. - I'm begging you, please. - Hey, hey, hey, calm down! Calm down! Can I get some phenobarbital, something to calm this guy down? I have a xanax in my purse. Save it. I'll split it with you later. This kid was reaching out to me... but the fire was a foot away from the fuel tanks. I ran. I left him there. I--I watched him burn. He couldn't have been more than 8 or 9 years old. I let him sit in the cockpit... gave him a set of wings. You're the pilot. I don't know who I am anymore. All I know is I'm not the man I thought I was. Dr. McNamara, I need you. - I'm not through here. - Let the nurse finish. We got real trouble. 180-degree gashes around the mid-biceps. Both arms need to be amputated. In triage? That's crazy. Wait till he gets to an E.R. He's hypotensive. The blood vessels are ripped open. The arms are unstable. Every time we move them more vessels rip. He's already lost too much blood. Why not put a vacuum splint and keep him on dextran till he's transported? No time. He's going into shock. That's the other thing-- he's a type 2 diabetic. He lost both legs already before this. The tourniquets aren't holding. He's lost 2 liters of blood. You sure you're up to this? Let's get started. Hey, buddy. You ok? You don't look so good. Is something wrong? No. My hands just, uh, shake when I've drunk too much coffee. What's your name, honey? Julia. Beautiful name for a beautiful girl. I have a daughter about your age. Yeah. I met her. N atalie. Is she here? No. Uh, I talked to her at the hotel across from the airport. Does she know I'm all right? I'm sure if they haven't released the names of the survivors, they will soon. How did you know it was me? She told me you're a Red Sox fan. Julia... honey. Now, be a good girl. Level with me. It's not just my pelvis, is it? It's ok, honey. Tell Natalie--you know, if I don't get to see her... that I want to be cremated. Hey. Is that any way for a Sox fan to talk? You tell her I had a great life and that she was the best part of it. Tell her not to forget that she is something rare and precious, ok? And that no mother ever loved a daughter more. Can you remember that? For the rest of my life. Hurry it up, ok, buddy? I got a plane to catch. I'm singing at my son's wedding. Try not to move, Mr. Perri. I gotta talk to the band leader, give him the music. Mr. Perri, I'm gonna have to amputate both your arms before you lose any more blood. Now, once you've been moved to an E.R., we'll do everything we can to reattach them. Do you understand me? You need a hand? Oh, thank god. I was afraid you wouldn't get my message. Hey, beautiful! How you doin'? You want to see my arms come on and off? Let's see what kind of cocktail that last bartender made for you, ok? Any update on Erica? No, not yet. Dr. Marcus, my associate Dr. Troy's arrived. Good. We can use you over there, Dr. Troy. curtained area. We got a 2-centimeter-long visible wound on the right-hand side-- I'm busy here right now. It's one M.D. to a customer, doctor. There's a woman with a fork lodged in her chest bleeding to death because she was afraid she'd die waiting for medical attention, so she tried to remove it herself. You still busy? He's low on morphine, Sean. We need at least another 25 milligrams. We need some morphine. Fentanyl, anything? We need something to put him out. Are you kidding? I want to watch. Christian! Oh, god! Thank you. Thank you for coming down. It's ok. We're all here. We're going to get through this together. I know, I know. Look, could you--just to make sure-- this woman I was with, she was just talking to me and she just-- her heart rate quickened and I--I think she's tachycardic. She's--she's dead. There's nothing you can do for her now. Look, why don't you... go back to the hotel, or home, try and get some rest. No. I'm gonna stay. I need to find my mother. She's hypothermic. Her BP's dropping to 90 over 60. It may have nicked an artery. Give her O2 and 2 large-bore I.V.S., wide open. Miss me? I bet you wish I were dead in that crash, huh, baby? Then I'd finally be out of your head. Is everything all right, doctor? Uh, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I just... a little tired. Uh, I need a--an angiocath. Am I gonna die? No. But  one of your lungs has collapsed, which means that I have to put a needle into your chest so that I can reinflate it before I take out the... implement. Ok? - Here you go, doctor. - Thank you. Why don't you just let me go, baby? I need some--some clamps, now. I'm still here. Here. There. And everywhere. Aren't you tired of carrying me around with you? Hon, let me go. Let me die. Where are the clamps?! Come on, give me the clamps! She--she's bleeding into the chest. Don't be afraid, baby. Death is just the ultimate orgasm of life. What is this? Give me something that I can use. This is all we've got. We're running out of instruments. Well, get me the oxygen. That's it, baby. I'm letting go. Yes, baby! I'm almost there. No. I can't. Yeah. I can't. Put pressure on this now. Come on, cover it. When you get her to the E.R., I want you to get a chest tube and some x-rays, all right? I'm not giving up on you, Kimber. My name is Karen. I'm sorry. Karen. You're gonna be fine. Hey, how am I supposed to see what's going on with all this stuff here? Try not to move your arms, Mr. Perri. Don't move your eyes... Sean, do it now before he comes down, I beg you. Once he does, he could go into cardiac arrest from the pain. Set off alarms for me 'cause I'm in love... I've never performed this procedure with these. Sean, just do it. Keep singing, Mr. Perri. Come on, you have a lovely voice. Thank you. And now in honor of the bride and groom... When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore... Bells will ring, ting-a-ling-a-ling--  come on. Ting-a-ling! - We're losing him, Sean. - I know. I've almost got it. Do it. We're losing him, Sean. I've almost got it. Almost got it. Sorry. I got it. I got it. He's gone. Call it. Time of death 2:45 a.m. Are you all right, Dr. McNamara? He was gonna sing at his son's wedding. Yeah, well, that's a shame, but we can't think about that right now. You gave it your best shot. We shouldn't have done this here. There was no way he was gonna make it. There was no way! The odds around here suck, doctor, but they're the only ones we got. I've got a severely burned patient that needs an allograft. This way. This is bullshit! The patient's burnt skin has got to be excised to prevent bacterial infection. I need to cover the exposed tissue to prevent dehydration, atrophy. All right, all right. So you're suggesting we get donor skin from a human cadaver? A temporary measure just until we can get him to a burn unit where they'll do a permanent graft. A type O universal donor would lessen the chance of an allogenic reaction. Unfortunately, even if we started searching the morgue, identification would be impossible. I know someone. Her daughter told me she was a universal donor when we were filling out the identification forms. She's over here. Hold that gurney! Ok. So you'll excise the donor's dermis so I can cover the exposed tissue on my patient. Looks like there's plenty to harvest. How much are we talking about? Whatever's still usable. Do you want me to--to skin her? This is stuff you did in medical school. I know. Sorry. I need a break. - What? Are you-- - No. I can do it. You're not a doctor. She's already dead. I can't hurt her. You said yourself, this is stuff you do in med school. Besides, she'd want me to. I'll excise the patient's burnt areas. You'll harvest the layers of skin from the donor. You've got to do it quickly and deeply, down to the dermis. We need to cover 4th-degree burns. Ok, med school, let's do it. Patient's been taken to the burn center. I think he's gonna make it. Good job, med school. I'm not still. I, uh, dropped out. That's a damn shame. Way to go, Helen. You just hit a home run. Julia... We found Erica. She didn't make it, sweetheart. Take me to her. Listen, Julia, the top half of her body is pretty badly burned. It's practically unrecognizable. Then how can you be sure it's her? There's identifying threads of the feather-lift that we gave her. She's the right height, right age, hair color and... And what? And the birthmark on her inner thigh is the shape of a diamond. It's still visible. Look, I know it's not that private, but it's the best I could do. I'd like to be alone with her for a few minutes, if you don't mind. Mother, it's Julia. What I said at the spa, it was only the anger talking. You know that, right? Do you remember-- how old was I... about 5 or 6? And you and daddy had had this big fight, and... you took me by the hand, and you said, "Let's go, Julia. We're leaving." And we went outside, and we just walked for a long time in silence, holding hands. We went to the park... You showed me how to put a blade of grass in-between my thumbs and blow on it to make a noise. And how I laughed and... you took my face in your hands, and you said, "I love you, little girl." And I squeezed you so tight, and I said, "I love you, too, mommy." And we both knew it was true. Do you remember? And then one day... it wasn't true anymore. I forgive you for not loving me. It's ok. I didn't love you, either. I just... craved... your approval, like it was... somehow possible to get it. I saved a life tonight, mother. No. 2 lives, actually-- a stranger's and my own. So it's ok. You can leave now. I don't need you to tell me who I am anymore. My mother's dead. Jules, I'm so sorry. - I feel so... - Shaken. I can only imagine. No. Free. Am I a terrible person? My mother just died and... and I feel like... everything's gonna be all right. You're a remarkable person, Jules. Every time I look at you in there, so capable and strong, unafraid of any of it. You would have been a much better doctor than I am. You know, I always thought I wish the one who could handle anything, who wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty, who could deal with all the shit that's just... part of life. I never wanted to know about Matt 'cause I couldn't live with the truth. I never asked about you and Christian because I couldn't deal with all the questions I'd have to ask about us. You shouldn't be so hard on yourself. There's a reason I'm a plastic surgeon. If something's ugly, I fix it. What's imperfect, I make perfect. Wipe away the mess. Make it all nice. I couldn't do what these guys do: Life and death, losing more than you save, and moving on to the next, just one after the other. You could. Sean-- All these years, all throughout our marriage, I left you to deal with it all: The mess of raising 2 kids... an unfaithful husband. You could hold it all-- the good and the bad and... all the grays in-between . I'm not the man I thought I was. My god. I've been up all night. I've been trying to reach you. My cell battery died hours ago. Well, I called the airport. They weren't releasing any information. Any--any news? No... not yet. Gosh, you must be wiped. How about I give you a little massage? I have some time until my 7:00. You can let your feelings out. You can cry. Whatever you need, I'm here for you. Don't be. Don't be here. I want you out. Look, about yesterday... sometimes people misinterpret me until they get to know me. I know you. I know you're someone who can only be big by making others feel small. I know I don't need people like you in my life anymore, and I know you're fired. What about my 7:00 rhinoplasty? Canceled, as are the rest of your surgeries. You're a bitch. Maybe... but at least I'm not yours. Ahh, sweetheart. I've been waiting for you all night. I couldn't leave the way things are between us. Did you hear the news?
