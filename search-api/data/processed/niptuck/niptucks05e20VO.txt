Stop worrying about how other people are react to you. And do what you want to do. You want the honest truth? You'll never get her a national campaign, not with those thin villainous lips. Dr. Troy, plastic surgeon and breast cancer patient. I know what it's like to see my mutilated body. But damn if I'm gonna accept it. Liz thought you would change. She informed me she's moving back to Miami. Thank you. Is it really completely pitch black? How are we going to know what we're eating? You have to have a little blind faith. This whole experience is about opening up your other senses and letting go. Good evening. Your name, please? - McNamara. - 8:15. Please, put your hand on the shoulder of the person in front of you and follow me. - Jesus, I can't see a thing. - That's the idea, jackass. We didn't come to Pasadena to eat at el pollo loco. Don't worry, mr. McNamara. I've done this a few times. Just keep your hand on my shoulder. Your waiter will be along shortly to present the amuse bouche and tell you about the menu. Enjoy your evening. Is he gone? Give me your hand. The amuse bouche, Mr. McNamara. Somebody's not wearing any panties. Don't answer that. It's Julia. One of the kids might be sick. Yeah, what's going on? Of course. My accountant sent it directly to the school. Hang up the phone, Sean. You can deal with this tomorrow. Just tell 'em if it doesn't post until monday, I'll call Stan. No, I sent Annie's sweater last week. - Yeah. Blue cardigan. - Sean... It was the only one in her top drawer. Fine. I'll check again. OK? Call you tomorrow. Sorry. Phone's off. No more interruptions. Teddy? Teddy? Come on. It could have been an emergency. But it wasn't, was it? I apologize. But it's over now. Let's go back inside. No, Sean. Until you stop taking responsibility for every little moment of everyone else's lives... - ... I'm not interested. - I can't ignore my responsibilities. A rolling stone gathers no moss. And baby, you got a lot of moss. Sorry, I'm late. Jesus, Sean, you could have scheduled Mr. Tree man in a couple hours after I finished digesting my sushi. He speaks perfect english, Christian. I'm used to such reactions, doctor. One day, doctors at U.C.L.A. flew me from Bali to Los Angeles to study my unique condition. I caused a student nurse to faint and switch her career. I've been looking like this since on my 18th birthday. That's when I first scraped my foot. I was swimming with a girl I had a crush on. The first wart appeared shortly afterwards and began to spread uncontrollably. Doctors at U.C.L.A. gave him massive doses of vitamin A to retard the spread of the virus. - I'm guessing that didn't work. - Mr. Sabri's condition was complicated by a rare immune system deficiency which enabled the virus to cause a massive proliferation of his cells, forming these cutaneous horns. It's just a guess but U.C.L.A. is not paying for our buddy Budi's little mani-pedi. Mr. Sabri, my partner and I don't want to mislead you. It could take half a dozen procedures. And even then we can't be certain how successful we'll be or what specifically we can accomplish. You're saying that I should... forget my dream as a fashion model. When I was younger, the people in my village would gather their children inside when they saw me coming. I was quite bitter about it. Now, if I could just walk on my own, lie down without pain. To think that I could just find joy in my life. Or maybe one day feel human again. Come on baby, dry your eyes, wipe your tears. Never like to see you cry... How did you get home last night? Call your mom? I hitched a ride with our maitre D, actually. Don't you want to get a shot with Mr. Sabri for your photo album, Teddy? There is a big difference between Mr. Skerritt and this poor man. He's a victim. All he's known for years is pain and isolation. Whatever. They'll be plenty of photo ops tomorrow at the press conference that I called. Mr. Sappy here should be well enough to smile at the camera and say cheese. I know. I feel just as bad for this guy as you guys do. All right? But I mean, come on, let's think about it here. He's gonna clock up at least 60 billable hours. - How are we gonna get that back? - If you want attention, co-author the paper I'm gonna write for the New england journal of medicine. You know, I thought being sick yourself might open your eyes a little to what people like Mr. Sabri go through. Do me a favor. Don't lecture me on how I should deal with my cancer. I dealt with it my own way. As far as I'm concerned, I think I did a pretty good job. And I'm a much better person because of it. Anyway, I have my 12-week check up tomorrow with Dr. Moss. So I'm looking to put this whole thing behind me. Oh, Jesus. Can you finish up for me? Thanks. Come on. Give me another chance. I'm not big on second chances. If I wanted to be with a pussy, I'd be a lesbian. Well, I can loosen up. I can be wild. I had sex with a doll once. - I'll tell you all about it over lunch. - Fine. Pick me up. My place. 1:00 sharp. So you swear she's had no fever, no rashes, no swelling of any kind? Oh, my God, Christian, she's fine. She's never been better. Except you can see the collagen's been absorbed. And we're back to our thin, villainous lip problem. - You're gonna have to do it again. - When pigs fly sweetie pie. I'm still having nightmares about what I did. Yeah, but you see, the Steves called. And she's short listed for this new vintage inspired baby clothing line for Target. Read my thin, villainous lips, ma rose. - It ain't never gonna happen. - OK. We'll just go down the block to Dr. Potsander's office. He'll do it. And I think we're gonna go to Hermes to get a new little baby treat. So we'll talk to you later. - You're not taking her anywhere. - Let go of me! Hear me! Hey, easy you two. No fighting in front of the baby. How's my girl? Let me see those lips. I was just telling Christian that the collagen he gave her has been absorbed. So if he wants her career to stay on the fast track, she needs more of it. First of all, mother of the year, I happen to know you did it. Sean, you're such an easy lay in every possible way. He did it. I told him I'd take the blame to save his pretty face. Poor grandpa is just too embarrassed to admit that he wants his granddaughter to be a big star because he'll never be one. If I find out you've injected anything into Jenna again, I'll have you arrested for child endangerment. Damn straight. Am I clear? I walked in. That crazy bitch is injecting Jenna herself. I stepped in so there wouldn't be any complications. - I love her. I'm trying to do the best. - Bullshit! You did this for you! Cause you wanted your granddaughter to get a modeling contract. Stop rationalizing, and think about the reality of what you've done. I thought you of all people, someone who was the victim of abuse, would have known better! How much further can you fall, Christian? Look at you. How do you like my house? I love it. It's amazing. Here's to a great day. Come on. I want to show you the bedroom first. This place is huge. Family money. Who's this? My brother, his sister, and their daughter, Wren. I'm adopted. I guess we can just order in. Or eat out. Strange. I didn't think I left the air conditioning on. The house is listed at 4.5. But I think I can get them down to 3. It's been on the market for almost a month already. Did you hear that? No. All the fixtures are original, painstakingly restored by the owners. Carra marble, brazilian rosewood throughout. Someone's breaking into your house. I have a secret to tell you. - When was the restoration done? - 2005, I think. I don't really have a korean brother. And this isn't really my house. What do you mean it's not your house? I thought it would be fun to break into an open house and have sex. Aren't you having fun? You're gonna love the view from the bedroom. You can see all of los angeles. You can do one of 2 things. You can either lose your shit and make a big scene or you can keep having fun. It's up to you. But you better act fast. Oh, my God! Who are you? Hi. Are these sheets included in the asking price? No. They are not. And they're 800 threat count egyptian, so the kims better not find any jizzum stains when they return from Big Sur. - Are you two interested in buying? - It's a little above our price range. Well, we love it. We... we'll take it. What are you gonna do, write us a check from jail? Would you take 20% down. We're both doctors. I'm sure we can arrange it. Doctors? There's a nice house in Hancock park I know you'll love. This one just went off the market. Dr. Troy, this is just aconsultation. Never hurts to advertise. Would you look at that? Courtesy of McNamara-Troy. Extraordinary. I'll be sure to recommend your practice. Good. Good. Good. Good. I'm just glad to have the whole goddamn ordeal over with. I'll tell you one thing I know and that is chemo ain't for pussies. I'd actually like to try you on a few courses of aromasin. It's known to be effective in... some of the more resistant cancers. The tumor has spread to the supraclavicular lymph nodes. The side effects are less dramatic with aromasin. Hot flashes. Joint pain. Headache. Fatigue. And the results? Uncertain. Our recent trials indicate that it slows the progression. It can also reduce the bone mineral density. So there is greater likelihood of fractures. In other words, I'll become so weak that... my bones will break. Possibly... in the final stages of the disease. - Give me a ballpark. - 6 months. With aromasin we might be able to give you a few more. I think I'll... I appreciate everything you've done. But I think I'll pass on another round. I'm over my limit. You have kids? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Good. You won't have to go through this alone. We get to do it in a tee pee? Can I talk to you for a second? I don't want to get into it You're a moral vacuum. Nothing I say, nothing I do, nothing I wish for is gonna change that. So where are you guys off to anyway? The desert. Don't wait up. - Did you see me? - I did. I saw you. But you shouldn't be doing that. Your muscles are too atrophied. Hardly, Dr. Troy. I've been exercising them everyday in preparation for the day when I can walk to the TV and pick up the remote control. The best part is... let me take a look. Give me your hand. Let me ask you something. With everything you've been through... All the pain and the suffering and... just everything. You ever... considered giving up? I don't have anything to give up. No, I mean, suicide. Taking your own life. No. Not possible. Since I believe as a Hindu that even I in this inhuman body am a true expression of God. You understand? I understand. I'm a firm believer that... I'm very much on my own in this life. - Do you pray, Dr. Troy? - Well... - not anymore. - You should. It works. You see, my prayers brought me to you. And in turn it brings me closer to my real dream in my life. - And what's that? - To find a woman. She doesn't have to be a beautiful woman, just a woman who would consider holding me, perhaps enjoy my jokes. Another soul that would accept me warts and all. I am a shaman. Welcome. We fasted like you asked. Good. Have you ever experienced Ayahuasca before? I dropped acid a few times in college. Ayahuasca is much stronger. You're both about to go much deeper than you ever have before. What do you mean deeper? It is possible under the power of the tea to cleanse yourself of all anxieties and depressions. You can even find a greater spirituality. But there is a price. The Incas call it the vine of the dead for a reason. The nausea will be extreme. You will want to die. But you must have strong courage and discipline. And if you are lucky, you may experience what is called the murdering of the ego. Actually, I think I'd like to try that. You are petrified Dr. McNamara. Untouchable like me. Not human. - I can't move! - That is your curse. This is fantastic. Are you happy now? Are you happy now? Sixty-six. No history of heart disease. No diabetes, hypertension. Last week his wife fell off a ladder in her garden and died. 2 days later he has a massive infarction. A broken heart. Romantic. - So, how's Miami treating you? - It's good to be back. I haven't found a place yet. I'm thinking I want to get a condo by the beach. I sleep a lot better with the sound of the ocean. You know, I hope it's not out of line, Liz, I have this really terrific friend, just moved in from out of town. Any interest in being set up? - Man or woman? - Uh, sorry, I just assumed... - aren't you gay? - She is with everybody else except for me. I am sorry. You cannot be in here. I'm a doctor, sweetheart. I know the sterile zone. OK, I am so sorry. I am so sorry. This is Dr. Christian Troy. He's my old boss. And what are you doing here? I've been on a plane or in an airport for 8 hours. I need to talk to you face to face. I'm not coming back, Christian. I'm a bad person, Lizzie. I know that. - That is not what I am saying. - No, it's what I'm saying. I know I don't have much of a conscience. I don't know what happened. Either I was born without it or it just kinda rotted away like some gangrenous appendage or something. And I know I get down on you about all your speeches and stuff. I just... I... I want you to be the voice in my head that tells me right from wrong. I wish you'd come home with me, Lizzie. I need you. We have been down this road before, Christian. What's in it for me? I want you to marry me. Lose the rock. It's getting in the way of the laryngoscope. Come on. Wish me luck. It's a whole new journey for me now. Good luck. Like throwing confetti at the hindenburg. - I'm not gonna hurt her, Sean. - Right. She finally pulls herself together in Miami. And you lure her back to what? Re-break her heart? Nice. What are we supposed to do with Teddy? Just toss her out? Well, if her dedication to her job is any indication, yeah. - I mean, where the hell is she? - Teddy's sick. We ate something bad. It was probably the oysters. I was up all night myself. You look a little green around the gills there buddy boy. Can't you just be happy for me? Liz is the only woman I've ever been with who forces me to stop being a dick. She doesn't do it by judging me. She does it by loving me. I don't want to go to my grave knowing that everybody thinks I'm some kind of soulless, inhumane asshole. Look, I'm not some kind of moral paragon, OK. And you're not about to die. You're getting married. Don't confuse the 2 like the rest of us. Linda is going to be the maid of honor. I guess that means we'll be getting married on a golf course? Congratulations, Liz. I'm very happy for you. I can tell. 15 blade. Excuse me. I'm not feeling very well. Christian, we have to talk. I'll do anything you ask. Just don't make me get married in a church. I think that Teddy is stealing drugs from the office. A ton of inventory is missing. - Who else could have done it? - Teddy is not a druggy, trust me. I can smell a druggy a mile away. Take a look at these pictures from bali. This resort is fantastic for a honeymoon. Come on. We are legally obligated to report this to the authorities. Now, I don't know Teddy at all. But we have to bring Sean into this. - This is serious... - Can you give it a rest, please. - I stole the drugs. - What?! I stole them. And may I ask you why? I was contemplating suicide. Then I changed my mind. And asked you to marry me instead. You are not a suicidal person. Your cancer came back. How bad? 6 months to a year. Is that why you proposed to me? I thought about taking charge of my death by using those pills. Then I realized that I wanted to take charge of my life. And... I want to spend the rest of my life with you... you and Wilbur. When were you going to tell me what my first year of marriage was going to be like? Oh, well maybe you weren't. Maybe you were just going to act like you were devastated and surprised - when you started to go to shit. - I guess I just wanted to enjoy the... sweetness of getting married. At least for a little while. You wanted to marry me so that I would help you die. You know what, you can just go to hell! Yeah, I got your message. I'm at the office right now. Where are you? What's this? I haven't seen you for 3 days. Where you been? I heard your old anesthesiologist came back. I figured you didn't need me here anymore. You ever done it on a surgical table? I don't think this is the time. You know my motto. No time like the present. You ever screwed on nitrous? - It's dangerous. - Not when done on moderation. And you will have the most intense orgasm you have ever experienced. You can trust me. I'm an anesthesiologist. You want this place to go up in flames? And there he is. Our Sean. So careful and methodical. And safe. And boring? Look, I spent my morning having a flashback that interfered with a surgery. I spent my afternoon on the phone with a very pissed off realtor who only calmed down after I made a very large contribution to his favorite charity. - You're going too far. - You are such a buzz kill. No. I'm a surgeon. It's in my D.N.A. to be careful and methodical and safe. The very nature that you detest is what keeps people alive on my table. I tried. But I can't change who I am. Frankly, I don't want to have to apologize for it anymore. I am so sorry. For what? 'cause this isn't gonna work out. Ain't gonna find it out there buddy boy. Find what? Something to say. Come on. Sit down. My best friend just told me that he's... dying. You got to say it. I actually have to say the word. It's very important. It just gets a lot worse if you don't. Trust me. Look, I'm the one who's got a $150,000 wedding ring. - Jesus. - You'll get your money back. I don't care about the money. It's Lizzie. You're right what you said. I dragged her all the way here from Miami and broke her heart again. She'll understand... given... I didn't mean all those things I said. I didn't know what you were going through. Do you really think you should be smoking a cigar given what your body is trying to fight right now? This is not a cigar my friend. This is pre-embargo, hand rolled, cuban tobacco. This is an artifact. It's been sitting in a humidor in Miami for over 40 years. I bought 2 of them for a special occasion, like my wedding. But under the circumstances, I think now's as good a time as any, don't you? Look, there are plenty of experimental treatments and clinical trials we can get you signed up for. There's the angiostatic approach. They use anaerobic bacteria to attack the tumor. Cancer treatment's not what it was when we were in school. Have a drink buddy boy. You need one. Were you listening to me?! You can beat this thing. You can get married again someday. - You don't know. - I've thought about all that shit! I mean, seriously. I don't want to spend the last few months of my life in hospitals. I just want... I want to celebrate every day. I want to get all my shit together and I want to... I want to enjoy myself. Will you sit with me? You got to try one of these. They're incredible. You didn't need to get married to make sure you wouldn't be alone. Why'd you want to bring me back here, Sean? So we can finish what we started. So even though it's dark, you can see I'm willing to meet you half way. You aren't wearing underpants. You dirty boy. Good evening. My name is jacqueline. I'll be your waitress. - The amuse bouche this evening is... - You know what, jacqueline, we're going to pass on the amuse bouche. And actually... we want to be left alone for a while and get used to the darkness. There's 200 bucks in it for you if we don't hear you for 30 minutes. As you wish, mr. McNamara. Get used to the darkness? I like that. And you'll like this, too. I'm glad to see you taking it easy mr. Sabri. No more long distance treks across the room. Let's take a look. Good. Little thickening of the skin. But so good so far. You know, once we're finished with these skin grafts, we'll have to talk about dancing lessons. You do a lot of dancing where you're from? When I woke up this morning, I noticed them. They multiplied as the day went on. I had such hope. Me, too. Have you seen my non-fat blueberry? I'm eating it. We're gonna have to start labeling things. Does that mean you're staying? I'm not going to have a long distance marriage. So why the change of heart? Well, I figure I'm gonna have to take care of your sorry ass anyways. So I might as well get a big honking diamond ring out of it. There's not one lesbian I know who could afford one that big. - You don't have to do this. - I know. But you know like they say, for better or for worse. I know you better than you know yourself, Christian. And I'm not gonna let you die alone. Look at it this way. I'll be dead before we can get divorced. We have a meeting with a wedding planner tomorrow at 9:00.
