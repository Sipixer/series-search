You really don't give a shit about me. I tried. Stop it, please... No, I won't stop... not until we're together again. I am pregnant. It's Sean's sperm. - And this is? - Ramona... my fiancee. I'm gonna work for her father in his carpet business. Matt doesn't want either of you in his life anymore. The whole therapy thing is bullshit. You're right. We should just end it, end us. - Ok. You ok there, dad? - Yeah. Yeah. Ok. So, Mr. and Mrs. Krieger, tell me what you don't like about yourself? I see you're both booked for the consult. We want our tattoos removed. This strikes me as a very big decision. Yes. Well, it first occurred to me when I was watching this documentary on the TV about Buchenwald. And suddenly, I was overwhelmed. And I thought, well, we have lived such a great life. We've survived so much since then. So, I... I want to erase this obsession with terrible things from the past. You can see, she... she's a remarkable woman. That's not what you said in the car, dad. Allie, please. Shh. How can I keep my mouth shut when holocaust deniers are more vocal than ever? When so many survivors have passed, why would you want to erase one single reminder? My daughter is upset, and I understand. She has a different perspective. And you, Walter? Are you sure this is what you want? At the end of the day, I want what Edith wants. She is my inspiration. This will be a chance, a second chance, for some joy. And I can give it to her? Yes. Take... take it off. You need to be aware that, uh, the work on the elderly is not as simple. The skin is much thinner, healing takes longer, and infection is always a possibility. Doctor, after what we've been through, please. This is bupkis. Yeah. Nip/Subs Team presents Season 7 - Episode 8 "Edith and Walter Krieger" Original VO: honeybunny Original VO corrected by chamallow35 Corrections & Resynchro VO : Sean God. These new corporate taxes are killing our bottom line. For every set of implants we do, it's like Uncle Sam gets one titty for himself. Still, it's a pretty good net, all things considered. I guess you're right... For those tax returns over the years. Well, I should get going. You can get all that stuff to the accountant, all right? You're not staying? I got dinner coming. No. I'd love to, but, uh... Maybe some other time. Hey. Hey. Uh, can I come in? Hey, Matty. You brought enough for 3, right? - Yeah, of course. - Ok. Yeah. Is this some kind of setup? I don't know what you're talking about. Wow. Smells good. Yeah. Ramona's been cooking all day. Ok. I guess I'm staying for a bite. Good. I'll get some plates. So, your fiancee cooked all of this? Yeah. She was just trying to support me. And... after we heard what happened at the shrink's office, you know... Uh, she actually wanted me to bring you both this. What is it? It's in Spanish. I don't know what... Let's see. It says, uh,... "please join us in celebrating the marriage of our daughter Ramona Perez and Matt McNamara. Casual attire," then something about parking instructions. I don't know. I, uh, started learning Spanish. I want Jenna to be bilingual, especially since half her family is gonna be speaking it soon. So, you're inviting us to your wedding now? Yeah. I thought you didn't want us in your life anymore. Ramona has made me see just how important family is. I was on the can all night after those tamales. I know. I even had mine for breakfast. - She's mine. - Oh, you think so? Yup. Good morning. How can we help you, miss? I know you like 'em young, Ava, but shouldn't you at least wait for his testicles to descend? His name is Rafael. He's my adopted son. As I recall, you left your last son on the floor to decompose while you dashed off to gay Paris. After I left, I, uh, I rented a small pension in... Le Quartier Latin where I... wept for days. Weeks passed before I received a letter from Baltimore. Adrian's death had been determined to be a suicide, which it was. I was cleared of all wrongdoing. So, naturally, you jumped on the next plane back to Miami to give your son a proper burial. I used my grief as fuel ...to move on. Adrian was covered in maggots. Stop! Please. Have a little decency. I don't think you should be lecturing us on decency. Look. Whatever you're here for, there's no procedure we could do that Dr. Moore couldn't do just as well. Barrett's dead. Series of strokes. I am not the monster you think I am. All my life, I've tried to turn tragedy into something meaningful. I started a foundation with the money Barrett left me that subsidizes corrective surgery for third-world children. Leishmaniasis. It looks like leprosy. Black fever, Jericho buttons, it's the same thing. It's endemic in areas around the Amazon. Amphotericin b, I think, is the recommended treatment. Side effects are horrible, often lethal in a child his age. Would he survive? My brave little Rafael? He's free of the parasite, but... has you can see, it's left its mark. So, why bring him to us? Because you're the best, and I want what's best for my son. You'd do the same for Matt, wouldn't you? You know, why don't you leave your contact information at the desk, and we'll send you a list of referrals? And please don't ever talk about Matt again. Rafael's only crime was being born into poverty. And now he's scarred for life. I'm trying to give him a second chance. Perhaps you think that Beverly Hills matrons who come to you for face-lifts are more... deserving. We're not doing it. Don't get carried away. She's evil. But that baby is just a sick child. And it is intriguing from a medical point of view. Look. I know you and I try to mend fences and all that bullshit. I get it, ok? But I don't give a shit if Ava comes in here with baby Jesus himself. We're not helping her. All right. This procedure will only take about 20 minutes, as soon as our anesthesiologist gets off the phone. Where are my tunes? Ok, I'm sorry. That was my gynecologist. I just got my CVS results. My baby is perfect. Oh, Mazel Tov. How far along are you, darling? I am 12 weeks, just past my first trimester. Can we dial down the estrogen, please and get my music cranking? The machine's on the fritz. Dr. Troy, could I sing a song for my wife? It will relax her. Fine by me. I didn't think you weren't coming into town for a few days. - You look great, Julia. - Thank you, Christian. You haven't changed a bit. - Thanks. So, where are Connor and Annie? Uh, they're at the hotel. I thought it best that I came to see you first. Oh, you gotta see my new apartment. There's plenty of room. You guys could stay there. It's probably easier than a hotel. I'm getting married again, Sean. Congrats. Good for you. Is it 2 brides? 2 grooms? Woman? Beast? His name's Edmund, and, um, he lives in Knightsbridge, in England. And he has an estate somewhere that's been in the family for, like, 400 years. Uh, what about our kids? I want them to come with me. Yeah, well, London is a 10-hour flight from L.A., so... Yeah, I know. And, um, well, I need your permission. You know, it's hard enough finding time to fly across the country to see them. Now I'm supposed to fly across the Atlantic? They need their father. Ok? They need a stable family. Well, I'm not giving up my rights to my children just so you can play house 6,000 miles away. It's bullshit, is what it is. I can't take a week off from work every time I want to see my kids. It's not realistic. And what about the time difference? If I don't call them by noon L.A. time, they'll be in bed. Can I get a 400? You know, whether we're married or not, we still have to do what's best for the kids. And she's not remembering that. You know, I think that you're the one who's forgetting what this is about. You're really losing her. - Julia? What are you saying? Look, I know how you feel about the kids. But what you're really pissed off about is, she's going. She's going for good this time. And you still love her. So, tell me about this guy. Ed? Well, he's a little older than I am. He's very intellectual. He reads a lot. He's, um, I don't know. He's charming. Rich? I hope. I don't want you flitting off to London with some kind of saggy-balled bookworm from Barnes & Noble. Well, let's just say he works very hard, and his balls are far from saggy. - Good. - Ok? Ok. - How pissed is Sean? - You are stealing his kids. I know. Uh, we all have to move on with our lives. You're getting no arguments from me. Trust me. Not on that one. You look great. Thank you. So do you. Thanks. How are you doing? In all honesty, this whole Sean thing's got me a little... You do know that he dragged me to couple therapy. Then you know he's always gone through these dark phases. You know he did when we were married. He gets through it. This time feels different. You look great. I'll be right back. You want to know what's weird? Every time I see you, I get a hard-on. After all these years... Does it have to be you... [incompr√©hensible] ...when I can put it in my pants? Christian, stop. You're moving very, very far away. Oh, Christian. Coming. I'd fire my receptionist if she gave out personal information. But then again, I'm very persuasive. Sorry. I, uh, I should have called, but... You would have said no. - I still could say no. To a woman with a baby who needs your help? No, Sean. You're not that man. You want a drink? No, thanks, but feel free. I know you had a hard day. You two should see a professional. And by "you two," I assume you mean... Your... other half. Notice I didn't say "better." Well, we're fine. You're either in denial, or you're very selective about the reality you accept. He's beautiful. Yeah. He will be. But his spirit is sheer radiance. So, we'll keep looking for a doctor who will help me... so that his appearance can... match the soul that's inside. I know you want to. There are so many children who could use your help. It's your choice, you know? You don't need his approval. It just feels that way. Oh, look at you. I would need all of his medical information... doctors' records, blood workups... I can try to find them. I've been moving around so much. No, just give me the name of the hospital where they gave him the amphotericin b, and I will get in touch with them. Ava... Why don't you tell me how you got this baby? I, uh, I told you. I should have known better than to be taken in by you. Get out. They had one caretaker for 50 babies... one. They let them cry themselves to sleep. After weeks of doing nothing but crying and screaming and wanting to be held... They learned to stop, to need nothing. Mothering a suicide didn't make me a prime candidate for adoption. My... past, it seems, hangs around my neck like a noose. I brought a small bag. Seen me with it before, so no one bothered to check it... empty going in, and... with this beautiful... if damaged... Little boy coming out. Was it illegal? Yes. But you tell me. Was it immoral? Should I have left him there? Scarred? Malnourished? Virtually unadoptable? So he could grow up alone and outcast for the rest of his life? Like me? You're incapable of telling the truth. Get out. Maybe I was wrong about you, Sean. Whatever it is that keeps you so... locked up and judgmental and unhappy... Maybe it's got nothing at all to do with Christian. Oh. Doctor, I'm so glad to see you. We had to take a bus, because my daughter didn't answer her phone. How you doing, Walter? This one gets a tattoo... ...and that one gets no tattoo Get me a wheelchair. He woke up this morning. His arm was swollen like a balloon. I'm sure it's just a staph infection. Walter, you're gonna come with me, all right? You're gonna get up with me. We're gonna get into the chair. The little children. We're gonna hook you up to an IV, get you into a bed. You should be fit as a fiddle in a couple of days. So, this is our finest Berber, perfect for high-traffic areas such as your living room. Um, here. There you go. Take your shoes off. Run your toes through it. Ooh, I love it, Tony. How is it with dog pee-pee? Don't start with that again, Anita, ok? Because I'm pretty happy with the linoleum. Yeah, but you said that when your mom came to live with us that we were gonna be getting new carpeting. I know that, but I don't know why you always have to criticize... Hello, Matt. What are you doing here? You look good, Matt. Where have you been the past 6 years? I tried looking for you. I always want that things to turn out differently than they did. I'm getting married in 3 days. I know. That's why I came. I, uh, I have a gift for you. That's a lot of money, Ava. It's the least I can do after all the horrible things I've done in the past. You deserve a fresh start. Is everything all right, Matthew? Yeah, honey. Hi. Um... Hi. Uh, this is Ava Moore, an old friend of the family. And she just came by, actually, to give us a wedding gift. Ava, this is my fiancee Ramona. And who is this precious little thing? Uh, that's my daughter Jenna. Hello, sweetheart. She's just perfect. Well, I think the three of you make a wonderful family. I'm so happy for you. Well, thank you. I have, um, business back in Los Angeles. Yeah. Traffic gets pretty bad around here. You might want get on the road early. I hope your wedding is everything you dream it will be. Bye, sweetheart. You good? Same shit, different day. You ok? You a little hung over from your bachelorette party with Julia? Very hung over. - Did you sleep with her? - No. But it wasn't for lack of trying. Christian, stop. No! I don't want this. I used to get butterflies whenever you walked into a room, or if you called the house to talk to Sean and I picked up. I thought about you when I was making love to other men, even Sean. And I thought for one second... that I felt that way tonight. But I don't. I still love you. But that... thing that we had, that... electricity... that's gone... Forever. That's kind of a kick in the nuts, huh? Well, one you deserved. How could you do that? How could you do that to me? I don't know what you're talking about. I spill my heart out to you. I tell you that I'm still in love with her, and you try to screw her in the bathroom of some bar? Hey. You know what, buddy boy? Like it or not, there's 3 of us. Ok? I'm not saying it's a good thing, but I love her, too. That's your justification? I'm sorry if this is hard for you to hear. If you want to hit me or you want to quit or do whatever it is that you like to do, you just go for it, ok? But I'm not gonna apologize for what I did last night. You're right. We both need to have our own way with this. I'll be around at 9:00 to pick up the kids. If I'm gonna consider this, I think you should stay a bit. Seems the least you could do. Tell me a little bit about this new guy. Oh, come on. I won't bite. Cheers. So, how did you meet this guy? At a mutual friend's dinner party. How did he propose? - We were in bed. - In bed? What, in the throes of passion? Julia, I don't think you thought this through very well. Sean, Edmund and I have been talking about marriage for a few months. Now, I know that it's gonna be difficult for the kids being in a new country, but... he loves them. And they need him, too, you know? They need a father who they can see every day. And you know what? I can't do it alone anymore. Julia... I'll move to New York, and we can all be together again. We were a happy family once. Just say the word, and we can have it all back again. I still love you. I've always loved you. I never stopped. Julia, just stay with me tonight. And I'll show you how good we can be... Oh, my God. You and Christian... you are unbelievable. You've never changed. Sean, you're both trying the same trick... professing your love to me like 2 teenagers. I've grown up. I've moved on. It's time that you did, too. I'll pick up the kids at 9:00. Walter, when you were delirious, you were talking in German. And you kept saying this one thing over and over. You said, "what did we do to the children?" What were you talking about? Edith, I... I wouldn't have known what it was. I was delirious, Edith. No, no. There was something... in your voice. There's something different. When you kept talking about the children, you said, "what did... we," like you were one of them. Walter, please. Tell me I'm afraid for nothing. Tell me you don't know what I'm talking about. I didn't sleep all night. Walter, what did you do? I was... I was just a tattooist, Edith. I was not the exterminator. - Is everything all right here? - No. Is not all right. - What are you talking about? I... I gave the prisoners the tattoos. Only the strong ones. It meant that they could go to work. Without a tattoo, they would be killed. When the war was over, and... I escaped to California. And I promised God to give me a second chance. If he would give me a second chance, I would live like a Jew. As a penance, I... I lived with the people that I harmed. You see here? I gave myself... I gave myself a tattoo. And I was your penance? Edith, why I was given this gift, I do not know, but I was. - God gave me you. - God is a joke! Edith, does it count for nothing? What I have become? How long I have been a good man? You always talk about forgiveness. Forgiveness, Edith. Hi. I came to return this. Ramona's not comfortable taking it. And neither am I. Such reverse snobbery. It would have been easier just to... stick it in the mill, I would think. Yeah, well, I like to drive around sometimes at night. It clears my head. Clarity's overrated. Ramona wouldn't object to you just having one drink, would she? Well, maybe just one. Good. Ramona trusts you... A good precedent to begin one's married life. Skol. You've grown older... even more handsome. Love agrees with you. Ramona is very down to earth... And nice. Good. You, um, you deserve someone nice. You weren't very nice at all. Just incredibly... What? Beautiful. You still are. Thank you. I, uh... I needed that. You always did know exactly what to say. Sometimes in the dark, when I'm with her, I think about you. I fantasize what my life would have been like if I'd come away with you... If we'd been together. Listen to me, Matt. You found something nice, stable. So have I... Beautiful baby boy. Forget this happened. Forget you saw me again. For your sake and Ramona's, just... put me out of your mind. You can't go. I won't let you. I have no choice. My baby needs help. Hey. What are you doing here? Yeah. We don't need any carpet. That's very funny, actually. Um, no. I wanted to talk to you guys about something... a wedding gift. I'd like you to do that surgery on Ava's baby. Did she come to you? I knew we couldn't trust that bitch. She's not a bitch, man. Her kid's really messed up. Did you sleep with her? Matty, Matty, Matty. She's like a drug to you, as bad as meth. The second you're around her, you start making bad decisions. Yeah, she seemed so different, though, you know? Like being a real mom softened her or something. I'm sure she was all puppy dogs and rainbows until she casually asked you to talk to us about the surgery. Well... that was my idea. - No. That was her idea. Matt, you've got a shot at the real thing here with Ramona... true happiness with a great girl. Ava is just gonna toss you aside the second she's done with you. I'm such an asshole, and she sucked me right in. You're not an asshole. Come on, now. What you need to do... is, uh, go home and get some sleep. You're getting married tomorrow. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, guys. I, uh, I'm so glad to have you back in my life. And I just want to keep you there. There are your prescriptions, pain pills, and antibiotics. Why should he get painkillers? He didn't give his victims any painkillers. Allison. You remember Leena Gold from Temple? Yes. She works with the Simon Wiesenthal center. Oh, my God. Allison, what have you done? I decided to call the OSL in Washington. Is that part of the Justice Department? Yes. And if the evidence warrants it, Mr. Krieger, or whatever his name is, will hopefully be deported to stand trial for his crimes. Mom, I'll take you home, and then Leena will stay here with him and wait for them to come. I'm not going anywhere. Fine. Stay with your Nazi. He's my husband. You are not the only one he has to answer to. Allison, Mein Kind, how are you ever going to live with yourself? Come, Allison. Come, dear. Where does it come from, this capacity to forgive? How do you do it? How do you not? Hey! Hey. It's quite a party, huh? Hey, Matty. You look great. So... So... are you ready for this? You know what? For the first time in my life, yeah. This feels right. There you are, Matthew! Hi. Uh, Celia, this is my dad Sean McNamara. - Oh, hello! - Hello. You have a wonderful home. Oh, thank you, Dr. McNamara. Welcome. - Come. - Ok. Uh... - Hello, hello. - Hey, Sean. Where are the kids? Annie is helping Ramona to get ready, and... Connor is playing with her nephews. Oh, good. It's easier to do this when they're not around. What is this? Sean... Thank you. Thank you, Sean. This means so much to me. Ok. Now we finally got that out of our systems, can we please have some fun around here? - Uh, yes. - Let's have some fun. Ok. Can I suggest one final... 3-way? - Oh, come on. - Oh, no. I mean this kind of 3-way. There you go, buddy. Our son's getting married. Maybe we did something right along the way or something like that. - I'll drink to that. - Or something. I know. Hard to believe.
