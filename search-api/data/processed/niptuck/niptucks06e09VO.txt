For years, I let him touch me. Your foster father? He's dead, and I thought that would end it. But it didn't. Christian, you're not getting it. We are in trouble. Hot shit, rock n' roll. We need to cut back everywhere. Congrats doc. She's a beauty. Remember Jack, spending is optimism. Your money problems are not my fault, Jack. I'm the one who bought the maserati from you, remember? I'm late what, 2 payments? No, don't do that. I'll get the money. Who's your daddy? Oh, you! you! I always wanted to screw the IRS. So kind. No one ever returns the favor. So, we good? With your tax bill? Sweetheart, that was wonderful, but that was not a $475,000 screw. I am not the treasury Secretary, Dr. Troy. I don't have the authority to make this kind of balance go away. How did this happen, anyway? You look like you do pretty well for yourself. Yeah, I usually just spend everything and then... pay my taxes with my last couple of paychecks. So do that. Well, you know, things have been kind of... slow. You made me come hard. I can get you 2 weeks. Then your case goes upstairs. Well, what if I can't come up with the money? I will get the money. I'll start with whatever equity you have in your house. Then your business, iras, pension funds. If that doesn't cover it, jail is always an option. I will bend you over your desk and turn you into my sloppy bottom... until i get every last cent. Have a nice day. Wanted to get a head start this morning, partner,... - hope you don't mind. - No. no problem. I was running late anyway. I had a meeting this morning. So I need to talk to you about something, Seany. - It's important. - I'm all ears. Seriously. We both know the business has taken a bit of the turn, and... anyway, i let a few payments slip here and there, you know,... - the mortgage, the car... - You're a little short this month? - Yeah. - Yeah. I can help. - What do you need? - I need your signature. I want to take out a loan against the business... You want to pull more equity out, in this climate? You won't even know it's missing. No no, no way. All right? We're already upside down as it is. And these days, you miss one payment,... they want to put a lien on your earnings. It's too risky for both of us. I don't really have an option, sean. How much you need, anyway? One fifty. - Jesus. - I know. It's just a bridge loan, though, right? - Yeah, it's just... - Till you get liquid again? - Yeah. - All right. I can loan it to you. Penalty's not too steep. I dip into my IRA. I can float you the loan, but you gotta pay me back... as soon as you can. You'd do that for me? Hey... We're family. Hey, Sean. There's a guy in your office. - He says he's your brother. - What'd you say? Brendan. Does that sound right? Brother? I thought he was dead. He is. Nip/Subs Team presents Season 6 - Episode 9 "Benny Nilsson" Original VO: honeybunny Corrections & Resynchro VO : Sean Brendan? Hey, Sean. Long time. I wasn't sure I... I probably should have warned you. I don't even... I don't know what... Jesus Christ, Brendan! I said good-bye to you. Mom did, too. We had you declared dead, legally dead. We held a wake. I'm sorry, sean. You know, that private detective looking for you for 3 years. I mean, I flew around the country. I even dragged the family to baltimore one Christmas because somebody had spotted you in a bar. And now you just... You waltz in here... no warning, no phone call, looking like that. Didn't seem like something I wanted to share over the phone you know? "Hey, Sean, long time, no see. By the way, I'm really into meth." I just, i thought it would be... better just to show up and take my licks all at once, you know? So, how are Julia and the kids? Living in new york, we're divorced. You look good. Handsome. I mean, i always knew you'd be successful. Even if dad didn't. And what have you been doing? I mean... other than shooting drugs and playing possum? I do carvings. I make wreaths, bowls, clocks. I even make my own candles. They're big with tourists, you know? I guess we're both pretty good with our hands. How'd you pay for meth on that income? I stole, sometimes. But I'm clean now, Sean. And I know I can stay off of the stuff. I just... I need... a little help. I need... a brother. And I didn't need one. There aren't a lot of people I can turn to, Sean. Brothers don't do what you did to me. You wouldn't have wanted to know me. Sean,... you wouldn't have wanted your kids around me. I want to be a brother to you, I just, I just... I need a little help. I just don't want to look like this anymore! Every time I look in the mirror, all I see is... somebody that I would never give a break to, you know? All i see is a freak... and a failure. Come on, Sean, you know that only 10% of meth heads ever kick that stuff. All the more reason he needs my help. Matt kicked it. For now. Can't believe you're giving that loser... my loan. I mean, jeez, I wonder what he's going to do with it. He's talking about starting a little business, a craft store. He makes these wooden carvings. Oh, brilliant. The one thing that people need to survive... in this time of economic crisis, a little whittlin'. Sorry, Christian but my brother's situation is... a little more dire than yours. You know, I can't just fix his face and then kick him out. Not when i spent years trying to find him. You buying him a condo? I'm gonna get him an apartment in santa monica. - Oh, jesus! - That way i can keep an eye on him. And he's gonna need a decent car. You are such a fool, you know that? Do you have any idea what this means to me? To get my brother back after all this time? Yesterday, I thought I was your brother. Huh? Where are you going? I need you in surgery. It's a family affair. I don't want to interrupt. Where's tweedle dumbass? It's just me and my brother today, Liz. You know, it's not really recommended that... a surgeon do such an extensive surgery on a family member... with no assist... You want to go ask him to come back? Go easy on him, Sean. I'm sure he feels like he's being replaced. Christian is going to have to take care of himself for once. Brendan needs me. And to get a second chance at having him back in my life... is something I can't ignore. 15 blade, please. You came all the way from Sweden for this procedure? No, not exactly. I like to travel with my son when his college schedule permits. What better education is that, yes? And you have gained an international following, Dr. Troy. The best in Beverly Hills. I'm flattered, Mr. Nilsson, but don't you think your son's... desire to look more like you is a little, uh... extreme? Yes, I do. There, you see, even the esteemed doctor thinks so. I've tried to discourage it, but... once Benny has set his mind to something... Since I was 3 and they adopted me, this is what I have dreamed of. To look like my family, like... their real son. And you think it would make them love you more? No. I know that is not possible. But looking like him... would be a sign to the outside world that... I am his child, no question. Some people think that ties of brother are stronger than ties of love. I'm afraid there's no talking him out of it. If you turn us down, We'll just have to go to Dr. Bravo Montenegro of Venezuela. I may not think it is necessary, doctor. My wife certainly wouldn't, God rest her soul. But if it's what benny wants... Creating a family resemblance through surgery is not a simple procedure, And i'm afraid that the expense would be considerable. The money, doctor, is not the consideration. I am not what you americans would call a... jock. I do not play catch with him... or share with him sports, things of that nature. But if i can help him feel good about himself, that is a father's duty, yes? So it measures the abnormal electromagnetic changes... in the tissue. How does it help with pain? Well, once we locate the abnormal activity, The probes... normalize it. Such a simple idea. How's it feel? You ok? Better? Ok, breathe. That's it. Sean, we're prepped and ready to go on the Nilsson kid, you plan on making an appearance or what? huh? What's that? It is the electromagnetic resonance healing device... invented by my friend, Ron Weinstock. - Did we buy this? - No, he lent it to me. It costs six figures, and I wanted to see how it worked first. I asked liz to look into alternative pain management. Brendan can't take opiates. He has to protect his sobriety. Whatever floats your boat. By the way, just so you know, we're coming home today. Brendan's going to stay with us, and i'm bringing that machine. No, sean, that's where I draw the line. No, he can't be alone. The temptation to use painkillers is too high. I'm not allowing this drug addict to bunk in my house! He's got a point. I've earned the bad rap. But i swear, Christian, I'm in a different place now. Right. - Are you serious? - Uh-huh. If you are, he and I will get a place and... you can look for someone else to split the rent. Just give me a sec, would you? You have nothing to worry about, Mr. Nilsson, he's in very good hands. But i understand, I'd be nervous, too. I know he'd appreciate your support. Really? Because... I thought maybe I somehow made him... feel less like my real family... because he wasn't blood. And that's why he's doing it. Being related by blood doesn't make a family. And I think he knows that. Thank you. Hit it. 15 blade. Oh, look, look! oh! That's the guy. Hey, you want to join us? It's a great game. Come on. Got an extra double double for you. I'm taking Kimber to Nobu. Oh. Glad to see you're saving your money. Ha ha ha, that's great. Yeah, I think the less time I spend here, the better. And i'm pretty sure that I'd puke watching wally... and the beave rehash their childhood memories. Cheers. You know, i got a couple of friends from my CMA meetings. I think i'm just going to crash... No, no, no, you are staying right here. Come here. Come on. Just until you're back on your feet again, ok? This is good for us. Don't worry about him. All right, jerkoff, where is it? Hmm? You know what i'm talking about, where is it? - Dude, i don't have any clue... - My chronoswiss. I don't even know what that is. It's a $20,000 watch, ok? It was in the self winder this morning. The only people who have been here are you,... your brother and the maid. And far as I Remember, Carmen's is bonded, so i can't imagine that she's the cat burglar. - Seany, was it you? - Of course not. Should I call the police? Did you take it? Sean... I swear to you, no, that's not who I am anymore. Bullshit! Once a liar, always a liar. You callin' them or me, what do you want to do? Put that down. You're living in denial, my friend, you know that? You go one week, then you're out of here. Hey, this is my home. If i want my brother to stay here, he can stay as long as he wants. Do i have to remind you that you're a paying tenant? Huh? Like I said, one week. And I don't give a shit if you go with him. I want my watch back by the time I get home. What are you two laughing at? Oh, Benny was just reminding me of the time we went skiing... together in Gstaad. Sounds like you guys live the life, huh? One of the benefits of my line of work is the travel. What kind of work do you do, Mr. Nilsson? International banking. Benny and I have traveled all over. Singapore, Tokyo, Buenos Aires, Cape Town. Wow, let's take a look at this face of yours and... hopefully get you two back on the road as soon as we can. Tell me what you think. Oh, it's amazing. I feel like I'm looking at myself at your age. Thank you, Benny. I didn't realize how much this would mean to me. I did it for us, dad. You know, if you're feeling up to it, you can... check out later today. Great. We're only in L.A. for a few more weeks. I really wanted to try surfing. Oh, that might be difficult, Benny. Your surgery has forced us to reschedule a number of appointments. Well, you should try it if you can. L.A. is a... great place to learn. I'd love to, Dr. Troy. I just don't see when I'll be able to get away, Benny. Excuse me. Of course. Yes? Of course, saturday? Would be fine. Thank you. We'll see you then. You know, Mr. Nilsson, I'd love to take Benny surfing. Are you sure? I don't know what a lesson would cost, but I'd be happy to pay you. What I need is financial advice. How quickly can you get me approved for an offshore loan? Sean? Wasn't sure you'd be Home, but I did get enough for 2. Sean. What, are you deaf, huh? Come on, brother. - Jesus. - Jesus. - You scared me. - Who the hell are you? Oh. I'm jay. Are you Dr. Mcnamara? No, I'm not Dr. Mcnamara. What the hell are you doing in my house? Sorry. I didn't hear you come in. My hearing's gone on this side. I don't give a shit about your hearing. How'd you get in? Uh, Brendan. You a friend of his? Is that what this is? Hey, Christian. Is sean with you? What the hell makes you think it's ok to bring... one of your charity cases in here when I'm not here? Sean knew, ok? I don't give a shit if Sean knew. And Jay's a close friend of mine. What are you, a sponsor or something? - That's got nothing to do with this. - Jesus, yes, it does. I can put my patch back on, if that's what troubling you guys. Can you just give us a minute, please? All right, look. I don't care if you're mean to me. But you don't have to talk that way to my friends. Hey, you listen to me. Sean and I share this house, all right? And i'm not ok with you bringing your crack addict buddies... in here when I'm not here to keep an eye on you. Oh, get over it, will you? I didn't take your stupid watch. I don't need drug money. I'm clean. You know, I've never understood why... Sean got into business with you in the first place. You don't even have half of his talent. Not even an ounce of his compassion. Sean needs me. Says I can protect him from being taken advantage of... by losers like you all the time. Yeah, you're laughing because you know it's true. No, no, no. I'm laughing... because Sean is going to fix Jay's face tomorrow for free. Bullshit. Oh, yeah. See, Jay kicked his coke habit 5 years ago, but the abuse ate his sinuses away so much... that he could never afford to get it fixed. Sean jumped at the chance to help him. Wow... You're really going to suck everything out of him... before you disappear again this time, huh? No. I'm not going anywhere. You see, Sean is my family. See, what you guys have is a partnership. It's business. And when that's over... and it will be over someday... you'll be gone, and i will never have to look at you again. Why wait? Let's take care of that right now, shall we? Get out of my house. Get your hands off of me! Asshole! Get the hell out of my house. And take the freak with you. All right. Let's go. Let's do a 3.0 vicryl. If I lived here, I would surf every day. Yeah. Waves are pretty nice. You did good out there, kid. You got a real feel for it, huh? You want to get dressed, just go use the bathroom right there. Thank you, Dr. Troy. Christian. This was one of the best days. Good, good. Look, Benny, you're dripping all over the travertine floor, huh? Why don't you go dry yourself off? I'm making us a siberian surf. It's great. You're going to love it. It's got hot coffee,... kahlua, irish cream, a little stoli. You want some cream on top? Benny? Benny, you want some cream on top ? Or you can just have it plain. I'm sorry. - No. it's... - It's just... I guess this is what it feels like to be a normal father and son. Just 'cause your dad's not into sports, I mean... He's not the physical type, doesn't mean what you guys... share isn't normal. My father is very much the physical type. Just not with you? The circles he travels in, the people... they are all very rich... and very bored. He finds it necessary to keep them entertained for business purposes. So... He arranges these parties. Very exclusive... and very lucrative. Sounds like you've been exposed to a lot of culture. Exposed. Yes, I have, as you say, been exposed. That's why I got the surgery. I needed to look more like his real son. Some clients doubted we were related. If we look alike, we make more money. You listen to me, Benny. Real family doesn't own you... and don't abuse you. They take care of you. That's what they do. Sean? I think we have a problem. What now, locusts? Your brother. He's in recovery with harvey no-face. What the hell is going on in here? I told him not to. He's going to screw up his face again. Not to what? Ok? Relax, guy. Look, there's... There's nothing to see here. I'm a doctor. You think I don't know what cocaine smells like? Where is it? Huh? What did you do with it, huh? This is how you treat the new nose I spent 6 hours building for free, you piece of shit junkie? Brendan brought it in, ok? So if you want to be pissed at someone, it's him. Look at me. I'm in too much pain here to control my urges. That is crap. He must have snuck it in with his stuff. I am Clean, Sean. I swear. What are... Why are you doing this to me, man? I helped you out! I don't care how it got in here. I want it out... with you. Dude. Where am I supposed to go? Well, you can try the emergency room. They have to take care of you there. Jesus. How many people have to tell me I'm wrong about you? I didn't give him the coke. Sean... Christian's watch, cocaine in my recovery suite. Is it just a coincidence this all starts happening after you show up? I'm going to be home at 7:00. I want you out of my house by 6:00. With nothing but the shit you came with. Dr. Troy. I have bad news. I've spoken with my overseas representatives. Turns out we're not as liquid as I thought. I won't be able to help you with your loan, but... on a happier note, your work on Benny is just so amazing. We truly look like father and son now. Not anymore. You son of a bitch, what you were doing to your son... is illegal in this country, do you understand? You understand me?! Yes! About that loan, I've decided to make it personal, ok? I want $400,000 cash by friday. - That's a lot of money... - By friday, you asshole! I keep your little secret, and you get to stay out of jail... away from one of those perverts who'd love to do to you... what you're doing to your son! Ok. 400,000. I can manage that. Just as soon as Benny can travel, we will be on the plane, and you will never see us again. You are going alone, ok? Your father-son freak show... is now a solo act. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. I wanted to give you this. You made this? I wanted to... tell you I'm really sorry about what happened with Jay. I think we both got screwed in trying to... do a favor for someone we cared about. Anyway, I need to grab my shit. I got a line on some work back east, so I bought a plane ticket. It's probably best if I go now anyways. Oh, perfect. He just walked in. Hey, Brendan, how tall are you? 6'1"? 6'2"? Why? Let's say 6'1", dark hair, medium build, looks like a loser. I tell you what. You send somebody out here right now, you see for yourself. Who is that? Yeah, sure. I'll hold. I come home this afternoon, and my diamond cuff links are missing. And the only person here was your brother, so now I'm pressing charges. - You're what? - Pressing charges, my friend. I set you up. I left them out so you could see them, all right? But... I'm sure we'll work things out once the cops get here, dust for prints you--yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm here. Yep. Mm-hmm. Address? Yeah... I never saw your cuff links, Christian. I haven't been home all day, remember? No, no, no, sure, man. You're out getting high and selling my stuff. I'm getting sick of you trying to make me into a criminal. - You're the one that's out of control. - Stop it! I am done with this asshole accusing me of stealing his shit! Who are you going to blame for your problems this time, Sean? Hey! I mean, you... what is your problem, man, huh? If you didn't do anything, why would you be so angry, huh? You're hiding something. What is it? Are you going to say anything? How much did that plane ticket cost that you just bought? You did tell me that you were broke. Are you serious? I used a credit card, Sean. You don't believe me. I don't believe this shit. I am out of here. Screw you both. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's take a look at the bag first. - Will you show me? - No. - Why not? - You don't trust me. Fellas. Are they in there? I guess he could have sold them already. You guys deserve each other. You ok? Did my father give you the money you asked for? It was wired to my account. He can afford it. We could clear 100,000 at one of those parties, you know. You shouldn't have to look at his face anymore. You know, I can... change you back to the way you looked before, you know, free of charge. I'm not sure I can go through another operation. And I can't afford to stay in that hotel much longer. I only have a few hundred dollars. Don't worry about that. Here. You deserve it. Should buy you enough time to figure things out while staying... as far away from your father as you can, you know... go to school, get a job. I don't expect you to understand, but... in spite of everything... I still believe he loves me. No, let me tell you something, Benny. Whatever your father feels for you, it's got nothing to do with love. And the sooner you understand that, the sooner you can go out and... make your own family and find out what real love is. Those the ones you soak in cognac? What's the occasion? Brendan's gone. Christian... I am truly sorry for all of this. Hey, Sammy, how much you want for this lighter? Goes for 225 on eBay. You can have it for 140. So, what would you give me for these, my friend? Cuffs are Roberto Coin. 36 grand at least on first dibs. Looks good. You don't need to apologize. I don't know what happens to me. I guess I just need to be reminded from time to time... who my real family is. Just enjoy the sunset, my friend. It's all water under the bridge. Hey, do you still need that loan? So, how much longer am I going to have to wait till your partner shows up? He's in the middle of surgery. I can have him pulled, if you like, but... as you can see, he signed all the proper papers. Oh, it won't be necessary. Everything seems to be in order. Don't need the loan anymore, buddy boy. Got an extension. But thanks.
