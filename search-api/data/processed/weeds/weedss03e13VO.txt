How are you? Good morning to you. They gonna treat us like Maya Angelou and Condoleezza Rice. So... How we doing here? Well, a lot of the plants that were ready for harvest didn't make it, and we're dealing with a lot less space here. You are asking about the crop, right? Yes. I'm asking about the crop. I'm running low. I can't fill you back up right now. I'm thinking of opening up another supply line. With who? There's this biker chick that Andy wants to fuck and a guy named Chess. 18-foot cross in my house. I don't know. Well, it's gonna be a little dry around here for a while. Then I'll do it. Lord!

"Risk" is all about Kamchatka. It's your gateway to the west. Think you're telling me something I don't know? Your housewives will love it -- Make them forget that their husbands won't fuck 'em. - How much? - Five for a pound. That's a fair price. Yeah... For a full pound. It might be a little short. You're good. I tell you what -- 10% discount. Take the first one on consignment. Why would you go and do something like that? I can tell you're gonna be a loyal customer. I'm all about loyal customers. But, hey, you bring me back that five grand real soon. Um, 10% off is, um, $4,500, right? - Yeah. - Chess, is it? - Yeah. - Is that short for Chester? - No. - It is. He hates it. See you soon, pot mommy. See you soon, Chester. Hey, I challenge you to a game, one-on-one. Winner takes all. All of what? Winner takes all, Nance. Uncle Andy?! Silas? Mom? Mom? Mom?!

I miss my ice floe. Look to me like hot flashes. - You taking estrogen? - Can't. Cancer. You? Shit. I tried HRT, ERT, and herbs. Vodka and cigarettes -- Only thing that works for me. Fuck this. Let's light up. Here you go. Conrad expects us to finish this planting today. Fuck Conrad. He in the shade. Yeah, but -- You got a boyfriend, Heylia? Husband, lover? Is he a piece-of-shit lying asshole? I had my share of them, but I'm taking a break -- Maybe a lifetime break. I think I'm doomed to be alone. Ain't no shame in it. But I get lonely. Buy yourself a dog. I'm not good with animals. Men and animals. Men are animals. Listen to both of you. Two of the scariest bitches on the planet. No wonder nothing with a dick wants to come within 100 yards of either of you. I don't see nothing that has to stand up to pee in your life, neither, So shut the fuck up, Vaneeta. Yeah, shut the fuck up... Vaneeta. "And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. "Then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel, he sent him back to Pilate." Oh, for god's sake, get to the punch line already before I die. It's no joke, Mr. Mertes, it's the crucifixion story. Luke: chapter 23. You remember where we left off last week? You read the bible to me last week? Yes. I read it to you every week. Okay. This weed sucks. We were low on MILF, so we had to go to a new grower. Well, it's ditchweed dreck. Don't let it happen again. I'm on borrowed time. This is not quality. I am so sorry, Mr. Mertes. Silas, make her give me my money back. This new weed sucks. I know. Nobody wants it. I told mom. We'll refund you, Mr. Mertes. Good. Now I got to take a whiz. If I'm not out in 10, do not resuscitate. So you're talking to me? You missed me. You pissed me off. 'cause you like me. - Because I like you. - I like you, too. I'm not good at sharing. Well, this you don't have to share with anyone. It's only for you. A little help here! You should go help him. In a minute. Bad boy. - You love it. - I do. Wait, hang on. There's more. This is inferior product. Planning a big night on the town, are we? Not with this shit I'm not. You got to hook me up with some better weed. They wouldn't even buy this at the manhole, and they smoke everything. I'm sure they do. I've got unsatisfied customers. My reputation is suspect. That outfit is suspect. Don't try to change the subject. We're out of MILF. Gonna be at least a week before we have more. Well, hurry up, okay? Clinique is putting the screws to me. We're having a sonogram tomorrow, and those things aren't cheap. You think you're ready to be a father? Do I look like I am ready to be a father? Terrific. I'm always curious about my customer's choices. Yeah. I think this one chose me. - Care to elaborate. - It just reminds me that "thug" means never having to say you're sorry. - Don't you mean "love"? - Absolutely not. "love" means you're constantly apologizing. Tell me about it. I should get "I'm sorry, baby" tattooed on my ass. Why don't you? I already got a giant eagle chained to a rock there. Looking good. - Want to take a look? - Yeah. - Came out nice. - Yeah. You have something for me? Thank you, pot mommy. And here you go. I don't think our business arrangement's gonna work out. And why's that? My customers don't seem to like your product. - Wait. My shit is good. - Oh, no. Don't take it personally. You grow merlot, they prefer cabernet. Your customers sound gay. Some of them are. Most of them just don't like your weed. Here's for the pound you loaned me on consignment. Good faith. I wish you luck in all future endeavors. So, see you around. Wear a helmet. Follow safety laws. Wait, wait. I'm disappointed. Are you absolutely sure that we can't do business. I am. That's a shame. But just to show you that there's no hard feelings, I'd like to take you to dinner, give you a chance to get to know me. I don't mix the business with the personal. According to you, we're not doing the business anymore. We're not doing the personal, either. Tell you what -- You think about it, you weight the pros and the cons, and I'll be in touch. Touch yourself, Chester. I got to go. Bye. Girls got balls. Yes, she does. But who wants a chick with fuckin' balls? Jesus, Doug. Whore. Hello to you, too. I've been doing a little light reading. How the hell did that cross get in there? Don't know how the fuck. Doug snuck it in on sanjay's shift, wired it, the whole thing. Mangoes, apricots -- Nice supermarkets y'all got. Yes. We blow a loud horn of plenty out here. - That kind of day? - Only kind I know. What the fuck... Oh, yeah. Please tell me you have a thing for traffic signs. I got a thing for these figs. - They're delicious. - You fucked him? That's none of your business. Okay. Get the fuck out of here. You think you're the first black man I've been with? I'm not? - You know why they called him U-turn. - You're just obscene. Come on. I never slept with U-turn. I just gave him a hand job. So now you're fucking with me. - You think? - Do I believe you? You'd better if you want to get lucky tonight. Why would you do that? - What, mess with you or get the tattoo? - The fucking tattoo. I thought it would make me stronger. Question is... You got a thing for women who got a thing for traffic signs? Motherfucker caused us nothing but pain. Motherfucker's dead. We're alive. - That's true. - Now shut up and taste this. What city has 720 bridges and 15 in its downtown alone? - I'm gonna guess... Pittsburgh. - Correct. What city had the first robotics institute? Nance? Pittsburgh. Carnegie Mellon University.
