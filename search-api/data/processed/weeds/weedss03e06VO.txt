Hey, I'm working the crops here. You ain't doing nothing but smoking mores and running water through dollhouses. Why don't you get your ass up a ladder and do it? - Should I get it? - yeah, see who it is. What I do with my time is none of your damn business. And when I ask you to do something, you fucking do it, 'cause I'm your aunt, I'm your elder, and I will beat you down. It ain't like you don't know we supposed to have a security s...

What you mean, "it ain't ready"?! Y'all had a minute to get this place up and running. Y'all got more excuses than a nigger in court. Pull it up, dry it out! let's hit the streets! Come on, let's move, now! Look, I told you... It ain't ready. Can't force nature. Oh, no? Hmm. Seedless watermelon... Broccoflower, aprium... half apricot, half plum.

You old fool. It's over when I say it's over. Aah! All right, Nancy, let's go. Did you fuckin'apologize? What's the matter with you? Listen, "thug" means never having to say you're sorry. An underground canal will carry the sewage right through agrestic to our water-treatment plant in van nuys. - Are you coming to the party later? - Yes - Well, how about being my date? We're ready to break ground, sir. What do you want now? You ever watch a man play with a big machine? Not for a long time, but you still didn't answer my question. Get over your issues, celia. I want you. Let's just start with a date, and we'll take it from there. - okay, stop right there. - can I help you? - Mr. Groff? - Dumb name. - And you are? - Warden Shlapobersky, from the wildlife commission. A mammal on our endangered-species list may lose its habitat with this new construction. We have to insist that you halt all work until we've further investigated the matter. Let me guess... the dirt shrew. Yeah, yeah. Looks like a jackrabbit and a big rat fucked. You're not getting anything else from me, wilson. This store is closed. Well, this project is on hold until there's a full report on the dirt shrew, and I'm referring to the endangered animal, not the one in the hard hat and heels who's been sucking your dick. I said, "don't let me move"! You're big. you're a large man. It's hard to keep you in one place. I don't let you move. Shut the fuck up! I ain't talking to you! Tell him to shut his fuckin'mouth. Shut your fucking mouth, Marvin! That's good. Oh, that was really good. Hey, listen, if you don't really need me, I need to go to the flower mart to pick up some Casablanca Lilies for my boss's party, and... and I hear that all the wedding planners get there early and buy them all. He'll kill me if this party tanks. You're being hyperbolic. I don't think he'll actually kill you. But me... I'm a different matter. - Put your hand on my shoulder. - Why? It helps me pay attention to my form! Do it! Review time. What did we learn last night? Lesson... make an impact. I'm a drug dealer... ... And I'm great at what I do. Don't you want to be great at what you do? Yeah. You been learning good, novice. But you got to do better. More money... Results... Faster. Now go get those lilies. Hi, we haven't officially met. I'm Tara. Silas. Hmm, community-service boy. I saw you sell mr. Mertes an eighth. Nice cross. Yes, well, I'm tight with the lord. So, he's aware you can spot an eighth from across the room? He is. In fact, he, uh, he likes it when I get stoned. We have some great talks. Are you gonna tell on me? Not if you smoke me out. Right now? Tomorrow. Same time. Gladwell park. Uh, smoke me out, and I'll tell you about my friend. Jesus. That's the one. Hey, hey, go easy on the jumbo shrimp. Those are expensive. Dumb name can afford it. (Hey, hey, shh!) You got to let it go, man. Love the food, pal. Want you to give a friend of mine a call. We're shooting a movie in one of our empty houses. Needs a caterer. you'll thank me later. Hey, you did a good job. How much of the budget did you stuff in your bra? Uh, half. - Can I feel? - No In that case, next time, spring for a hall. Now, you see that fella... Baldy, the white-haired clown? Let me know when he's good and shitfaced. I need his signature on something. And that woman there in the chanel knockoff... She needs the recipe for the stuffed mushrooms. She's a big fan. she's also someone's wife. I need to borrow her for a minute. You are going to talk to me. In, in. Okay, listen. I know we're in the middle of the party and everything, but, Nancy, you have got to stop hating me. - I don't hate you. - But you do. Celia, I don't. Listen, you got me a job. What's done is done. I don't want to fight anymore. Let's just leave it. Good, then. - Okay ? - I'm glad. - Great. - Goddamn it! These fucking ankle-strap shoes. Has Sullivan ever talked about me? - What? - Has he ever mentioned me? Yes. He calls you the hot redhead. Are you sure he was talking about me? Because I've always thought I was more... ...Auburn with, like, strawberry blond highlights. He was definitely talking about you. He likes you. You should go be with him. Nancy, there you are. Matt Keefe doesn't have  a drink in his hand. Hey, man, what's up? Did you tell some woman in a Chanel knockoff she could go through my recipe box? Out, out, all of you, all of you! This room is off limits! Okay? Out. Get out. - I'm really glad... - Get out! What are you doing down here? These little smokies are like crack. Don't eat too many of them. They're filled with nitrates. I really have to talk to you. Well, bad time. We'll talk later. I promise. You look beautiful tonight. Thank you. I want to thank you for being my date. You're welcome. You know I'm gonna keep trying. Good. Who are you? A sheep in god's flock. Let me hear you say "baa." You want a drink? Mr. Johnson gave it to me after he confused me with his war buddy. I don't drink. Wine's okay because jesus drank that, but, other than wine, I don't drink. But you smoke. Only weed, not cigarettes. Never cigarettes. You don't drink, you don't smoke cigarettes. Let me guess... you don't have sex either? Not until I'm married. How can you be all into jesus and still smoke weed? Because pot is natural. It's not processed. It's made by god himself, so it's spiritual, elevates you, opens your mind, and that's what god's love is all about. I can see your boner. Fuck. Don't be embarrassed. I mean, that's part of god's love, too. Once you're married. You're right. My virginity is for my husband... But that doesn't mean we can't have some fun. You okay? Of course. I was just at this party last night and fell up on two big-booty freaks, that's all. - They kept a brother up all night. - I'm coming! Keeping up with my heart rate, swinging my arms. You gonna let him beat you? Come on! First one to the next tree wins! U-Turn? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Marvin! What is it? What's wrong with him? He got high blood pressure. I saw some people at the bottom of the hill. Run and ask them if they have a banana. He needs potassium! I'll stay here. you'll be okay. You bitch-ass bitch... I got you now. This is for saying I was too stupid to be your second in command. And this is for laughing at me for going to "Dreamgirls" and for never letting me count the money. You gonna die, motherfucker. Don't die on me, coz! No one has any bananas. We need to get him out of here. Let's pick him up. U-Turn's dead! He's dead! What am I supposed to
