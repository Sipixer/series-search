I have no ideawhat you're talking about. Ah,that doesn't matter. I have pictures --dealers coming and going. I even followed one -- the gayindian kid -- on his rounds. I have cellphone wiretaps. Some of it's static-ridden. I guess it's time to investin that newer technology. But yougetting the idea? Isn't that what pellicano'sgoing to jail for -- illegal wiretaps? Inadmissible in court,absolutely. Illegal? Yeah. But if theywere to show up anonymously at the d.e.a.office, I bet an extensiveinvestigation would ensue. How much do you want? Hey,i'm not greedy.

You're a drug dealer. With expenses. Consider thisone of them. Hasta la tomorra! Celia:son of a bitch. Oh,look who's here. My family. Hey,family. Did you knowthat we're poor? We're really poor. Maybe we should cut downon our liquor purchases. Oh,no. All the poor drink. Yeah,i sawthe poor this morning. They all had bottlesin paper bags. That's what i need --a paper bag. Wonderful idea. You couldput your bottle in it and then vomit in itwhen you're done. I don't vomitfrom drinking. I vomit wheni think about my life. Isabel,why don't yougo for another walk? See? I'm not the only one whothinks she needs more exercise. I don't thinkyou should be alone with her. It's okay,honey. Why don't you go to shane'shouse or something? Fine. I'll call in later. Shane's house. I will rock the house of shanebefore i'm done. Make some coffee,celia. Oh,not so fast,roller-boy. Aguatecture. I don't knowwhat you're talking about. Agua-tec-ture. - I don't knowwhat you're talking about. - Fine And even if i did,i wouldn't tell you. What the fuck? Tell meeverything. You're insane. Yes,i amfucking insane. Tell... Me...Everything. Oh,god! God damn it! Up until this point,i have avoided your nuts Because god knows what is insidethat fucking diaper of yours. But so help me,if you don't come clean, I will make sure a catheter is a permanentpart of your anatomy. - Bitch. - Perhaps. God! God! Talk to me. Fuck... You! Okay,i'm done playing. Balls are next. Okay!Okay,please. Please don't hurt me anymore. I'll talk. Pleasedon't hurt me anymore. Aguatecture. Aguatecture! I'll tell you. Just take your foot off.Please! God,i'll tell you everything! Lovely morning. It dependswhere you're sitting. Aw,it's notso terrible. You'll make more money. There's always more money in your line of work. And there'salways more blackmail. What's to stop youfrom coming back? I give you my word. You're blackmailing me. You've threatened to destroymy life unless i give you money. Yes. I promise i'll neverdo it again. Cross my heart. - I have kids. - I know. Took their pictures. Handsome boys. Can i have my money now? They're not just handsome. They're also smart,especially shane. Off the charts. There's a $100 buy-inat commerce in an hour, and i'd reallylike to be there. You're mugging me -- you'll take a minuteto listen to what i have to say. My smart son,shane,took me to a store yesterday -- - Panorama city --off the 405. - ******** Spyware store. You ever been there? It was my first time. I bought myselfa teeny little microphone that you hideinside your blouse. Recordseverything you say... Transmits it backto shane's computer -- actually,any computer. Only $49.95 Technology'scome a long way. And sinceblackmailing's a felony,even when you do itto alleged drug dealers, you probably want me to keepthis conversation to myself. So,i guess whatwe have here is a détente. You tell the police what i dofor a living,not good for me. I tell the policeyou blackmailed me,not good for you. Understood. Now... I don't knowho your client is,but i have a pretty good idea. Whether you tell her whati do for a living is up to you, But i stronglyadvise against it. This is for me? It's a lovely morningafter all! Oh,go fuck yourself. If i could,i'd save a fortunein strippers and alimony. I'm off to commerce. You wish me luck? So,how much do youhave for me this time? $500? $200? Some loose change? - I don't have anything. - Shocking. - And it's your fault. - How's that? The private investigatoryou hired shook me down, Took all the moneyi was gonna give you. Shook you down --for what? None of yourgoddamn business. But nowi have nothing. And frankly... I'm pissed. - You're pissed? - Yeah. You didn't trust me,and you really should have. I was gonnaget you your money. - Sure you were. - I was. And by the way,it wasn't even your money. I was legallyentitled to it. Mrs.Scottsonnumber two. Me. Not you. But now it's his,and that isn't my fault. So i guess the whole pointis moot,actually. Thenwhy are you here? I thought... I needed a friend. I don't need a friend. I don't need anybody. Don't call me. Bye. Please tell me you werejust in the neighborhood. Your friend celiacame to aguatecture. How the hell? Did she see anything? What does she know? I was wonderingthe same thing,so i gave her a call, 'Cause i still had her number. She told me to tell you sheknows you fucked her boyfriend And she knowsyou're dealing again... And she'll be in touch. She'll be in touch. How bad is this,nancy? -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-
