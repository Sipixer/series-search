Hello teachers, parents, stepparents, siblings, boyfriends and girlfriends of parents, all sort of relatives, friends of your mom and dad who you call aunt and oncle but really aren't. And, Principal Dodge. As I stand before you today, on the brink of Junior High, here is what I have to say : You have failed us all ! Everything is not okay ! We have become alienated desensitized, angry, and frightened. If we picture Agrestic as an airplane, A grand soaring jet carrying us through the sky. I think you all need to understand, there are motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane. Okay, that's it Botwin. That is quite enough. You said no profanity. You are done, and here's your diploma. And you are Agrestic Junior High's problem now. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to give out the diplomas. Let him speak ! Let him speak ! Motherfucking, let him motherfucking speak ! I will call off this graduation if we don't have order right now ! I mean it ! Let him speak ! ... Everybody be quiet ! We are not safe ! *You move... you feel safe, but your children are not safe ! I have to go, um. I think take Shane to the party, and I'll see you guys later. Tell Shane I'm sorry, I had to go. Where you going ? It's business. Where are you going ? Congratulations, you've all graduated. Goodbye ! Just making sure you were coming. We both know how you lie. Either you control your woman, or I will. I hear you, I'm cutting in. Are you my boyfriend, or not ? I liberated a case of Cactus Cooler for the ride I'm not coming with you. I tastes like baby aspirin. Well, in that case, I'm still not going with you. Jesus, you've scared me. You ought to let a person know you're coming. I could have cut you up into seven little men holding hands. You hear from our friend ? Yeah, he left a note on my car just trying to scare me. - Is it working ? - Fuck yes ! You're a good kisser. Oh shit. What ? What's "Oh shit" ? Abumchuk. It's now or never. Come with me. I can't be alone, and you're my favorite person on earth. I can't do it, Kat. Why ? Fuck you and give me your van keys. You can't have my van ! I'm just gonna steal it anyway. Wife fucker. Carrer wrecker. You punched my neck ! You're freakishly tall. Most of are freakishly long, so imagine how much of me was inside your wife. Hey, come here. Did you hear my speech ? No, I.. I missed it. - You're an asshole. - Look, I'm sorry. Ok I had stuff to do. Where's mum ? I don't know. She took off during my speech. Did she say where she was going ? No, she just.. left. Some fucking family you got stuck with, huh. Hey wassup ? Men, you're coming in real time, or you're coming in black people time ? I will be here. Black people time ? Some of us like watermelons, some of us got big dicks, Most of us have trouble getting in places on time. I get it. I like gin, and I'm not much for hugging. Did you bring your gun ? Actually, that's one cultural stereotype that I'm not fulfilling today. I brought a gun. Celia left one at my house this morning after she shot on my kitchen cabinet. Jesus, give me that fucking thing. There aren't any bullets in it. Another great plan from you. You shouldn't put metal in a microwave. Hi honey, I got your note. You sure know how to charm a girl.
