I don't want to see your balls, man! Tuck 'em away! All right. There. There. Fine. Ready? Okay. It's coming. oh, and it's a good one. Hey, what is that? It's showtime! Wow! That was Rodriguez? Yeah. And they fucking killed him. For trying to light farts? They don't need a reason, Doug. It's Pat Tillman all over again. I got to forward this to my fraternity brothers. Forward it to Lowell Bergman, all right? Forward it to Harry Reid. Are they beta phi omegas? Ok. I love you. And I thank you for the pants and the chinese food and, what, 70, 80 bucks that you got here. But uninformed Doug, Doug of the disengaged electorate, that Doug needs to remove himself from the room 'cause I'm riding the edge here. D'you want me to answer it? That's how they track you. That's how they got Rodriguez. If you answer it, I could be a dead man. - Hello? - <i>Mr. Botwin.</i> He's not available right now. Who, may I ask, is calling? You know who this is. What? What? Scary. Deep voice. Very deep. Very scary. You can't stay here. They are going to kill you, Andy. I sold Jesus a quarter ounce at the fast mart. He's a mexican guy who's on roadkill with me, working off a D.U.I. He loves the lord, and he loves weed. And so does his cousin Javier, who works in the kitchen at Amechi's. I only sold him a dime, but two of the delivery guys bought a half ounce each. Got a free meatball sub, does that happen to you a lot? - Free food? - Not really. Happened to me twice today. Want some jerky? Thank you, no. After the sub, I drove back, and checked in with my supervisor, - and he sent me to bingo. - Bingo. At the retirement home, run by church volunteers and misdemeanor felons. Three customers there. Mr. Mertes. You sell to Mertes? Any cars following you? No. You sold $2,000 in a day. - Impressive, huh? - Temporary. This is not a career path. This is a family in crisis. And I'm being the good son. I'm assuming you burned through your client base. Kinda. Okay. I'll make some calls. But if you sell to these people, you're not the good son. You're some random punk who sells for me. Pick an alias, work your deliveries around your community service. Will do. Give some jerky to your brother. He's mad at me. - Why this time? - I put him in Majestic Summer School, to keep him off the streets, away from drugs. I love that sound. Hammer the nails, pour the cement down. Good men are gonna raise their families here. Of course, it's that kind of missionary zeal that's got us into this mess, isn't it ? We need these sewer lines. We need these votes. And the word around town says, "You get Doug Wilson's vote... The rest will follow." Well, that's beautiful. I'm thinking a golf membership. Ok. Now, I know a lot of you are looking up at this board and you're thinking in yourselves, "Critical Thinking? That sounds kind of square, sounds kind of whack." Ok. Who here can tell Bob what "Critical Thinking" means? Anybody? Hit me. Critical thinking is the process of conceptualizing and analyzing information, gathered from observation or communication as a guide to belief in action." You got a name, friend? Shane Botwin. Dap? Blow it up. Shane Botwin, let me ask you a question. Do you want to spend the next couple of weeks reading out of a textbook, or would you rather keep it real? I guess --keep it real. 'Cause I can assign you pages from the textbook. You can copy them into your notebooks, regurgitate them later for a test. I can do that if that's what you want. Or... Maybe you and I can solve a murder. Cool. Two Gs. That's right. The agreement was $12,500. You breaking the social contract. Well, I'm working with some new people. It takes time. 10 grand light. Usually get a nigga shot. Oh, good thing I'm white. I've been shot! I've been shot! What the fuck happened? I was getting the mail, a truck comes by. Blam! Blam! Blam! Shot in the ass! - Hi, Marvin. - Hi, Nancy. You two, go outside and start rousting niggas. Find out who saw what. Man, you think it was the mexicans? Cucaracha motherfuckers need to get stomped!

No way. - This one of these hybrids, huh? - Yes. How are you doing back there, Marvin? Got a fuckin' bullet in my ass! Are we sure this is the way to the hospital? We ain't going to no motherfuckin' hospital. Charge you 50 bucks for an aspirin, treat you like shit... ...if you don't have insurance. Make a right. We got our own guy... Dr. Tupelo. He don't ask no questions. And he real good at takin' bullets out of people. Lovely. Can't wait to meet him. Marvin, what's the gang sign for those tres seis bitches? Yeah, that's what I thought. - Make a right. - Who's tres seis? The three sixes. Guillermo's crew. Little bitch is all moody 'cause he thinks I jacked his horse. You did. That don't give him permission to shoot you in your ass! That motherfucker gonna get his. You don't mean "horse" like, like, horse like "neigh"? Don't play that Doe-eye cute shit with me. I know you know better. Oh, honey, it's gonna be okay. - You buy or lease this car? - Uh, I bought. Hmm. How much. I don't really recall right now! There's a man bleeding in my backseat! I have to pick up my son from summer school! Make another right. I have to get this. Hello? I just want to make sure those packets went out this morning. - Oh, yeah, absolutely. - Liar! - Who's that? - Who the fuck is you, nigga?! Oh, sorry, I'm losing you. Bye! - Make another right and slow down. - Okay, now we're driving in a circle. Yeah, but we're about to go straight in a second. Yeah, motherfucker! Drive, bitch, drive! We need these sewer lines. We need these votes. And the word around town says, "you get Celia Hodes' vote, the rest will follow." I hear Doug Wilson is getting a golf membership. I love a woman who does her homework. Would you like a golf membership, too? - I don't play golf. - Oh. Well. What is it you do play, Celia? I play house. Hey, sweetie. - How was your first day? - Mostly sucky. Only mostly? Hello. You must be Shane's mother. - Hi. - Yeah, hi. Eve Meriweather, Education Coordinator. Well, Shane had a fabulous first day. Bob really took a shine to him. Bob. That's great. - What happened to the backseat? - Mom spilled some coffee. And this is for you. It's just some forms and permission slips. It covers everything you'll need to know about the absolute truth ministries campus. We got some super-great programs, "Prayer Power" meetings. And not just for Shane but for the whole family. You're a jewish, right? Um, no. I'm not. Shane's father was a jewish. Did he pass? Most people thought he was italian. Yes! Yes, he's no longer with us! - Yes. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Losing your husband... I just can't imagine. - Well, God bless you. - Are these shell casings? Oh, Eve, in a rush! Got to go. Got to make dinner. Buckle up, honey. All right. We'll see you. Bye! So, when you cast your vote tonight, rubber-stamping another environmental holocaust the name of "Urban Renewal," I want you to remember the san acitos dirt shrew. How could we forget him? Their beauty was here long before we were. This sewer is soaked in their blood. Thank you, Jane Chaffin, founder, president, and sole member of the Agrestic Eco-Warriors. Your passion humbles us. And that concludes the public debate on motion 412, proposal to expand the sewer and water reclamation systems of greater Agrestic. Let's do this. - All of those... - All in favor of more pipe, say "aye". Aye. - Aye. - The "Ayes" have it. A moment of silence for the dirt shrew. The motion is passed. What the fuck did you get ? House still for sale? Andy ? Andy's dead. I'm Bill. Bill Sussman. Here is your mail. How's the army? They killed Rodriguez. I think I killed a Hernandez. That's a wig ! Yeah that's all they had at rite aid... Mostly wigs for black women. Are these bullet holes back here? What? Oh those? I was in a drive-by shooting yesterday. I was ... driving the car, this car! I may be a murderer! Murderess. Actually I think we only clipped him, you know, hit him in the leg. - Hit who in the leg? - One of the Mexicans, Tres Seis. They shot Marvin. Who's Marvin ? I'm scrubbing his blood out of the backseat. It won't come out! Are you ok? - Actually Andy.. - Bill Sussman. I think I am ok. I mean, stuff keeps piling on, piling on... And while, tomorrow is another day. I'm pretty sure it's only giving more heinous is gonna happen to me because that just seems to be the way it rolls. I really think i'm finding myself! Look at my hand! Nerves of steel. - Pretty steady. - That's what I'm talking about. Well, this is all good. Meanwhile, a reconnaissance drone killed my battle buddy. And, I'm going to die. I know too much. I was hoping for a shower. Maybe a little nap. But... You obviously are having a slow psychotic breakdown so I'll just ask... Do you have any money? No I don't... I have a backseat full of blood... I have two licence plates. I may have to remove. I have an assistance's job that a monkey could do. I have a death wish. You're welcome to any of those sparkly gems. But as far as money goes... Bill. Everything that comes in, goes out! I'm gonna go now I like this new you. She's a winner. Tell the kids I miss them. You betcha. Where d'you hear that? You're sure about that? That's good news! Cool. And? Gunfire in the streets. Brown fighting black. Black fighting brown all on account of somebody shot Marvin in the ass. Something about a Mexican, and a tinted truck... Driving up and... pop pop pop : right in Marvin's ass. That's one big ass. Maybe if that Mexican had a better aim, he wouldn't have needed three shots. Maybe if he had'n't used his auntie's snubnose piece of shit you'll be right. Still... War is on. War is on...? - More males..? - I think that's the last of them. And why are you doing that? Got to separate the males from the females, or they'll fuck up the whole crop. How d'you know they male? They got a little plant dick? No dicks, just sacs. Plants looking good in there. That's because it's a room full of women! Steppin' up. And we're sitting out there like lambs. And Rodriguez, he's got the cellphone up in his hands, just like that. When it struck. Right in the chest, into his heart. Tell them. - What did he say? - He says "Wow"! - Shocking ... - Shocking ! Shocking ! A naive kid, a great kid. Who only wanted to serve his country. eating our vindaloo, Watching "dancing with the stars", And we don't wanna know about it! You tell that to Rodrigez tell it to his fucking corpse Hey Mom. Hey you. Got a lots of calls from clients today. - Oh yeah? - People seems to like the new guy. Judah. Tip of the hat to the old man. We're gonna need more product soon. I'm having homework issues. Come here, let me see. The day after prom, A murder has taken place, and blood has been found. Principal Paul calls up detective Dan to investigate. It's like an episode of CSI. I have to use my power of critical thinking... - ...to solve a murder. - Who's that? That's Kyle. He disappeared right after the murder. This is Jill. Her blood matches the blood found at the crime scene and... ...this is Mia, the cheerleader. Kyle promised to take her to the prom... ...then dumped her hard. Jealous Mia murdered Jill. - That's what I thought too. - So what's the problem? Every day we get new clues, and today we got this one. Two days later, Jill, arrived at school. I though Jill was murdered, that's bogus. No body, no murder. It doesn't add up. -W- w-v-m-d -W-w-v... What would Vic Mackey do? He'd plant evidence and coerce a confession. Okay but, what's detective Dan gonna do? Drink myself into a stupor and, sleep with my prostitute/informer. No more cable for you. Mr Botwin. This is my lawyer, Dean Hodes. Gentlemen, we called this meeting because my client is tired of ... - We don't care. - Go fuck yourself. You're in possession of US military hardware Mr Botwin. Where's the phone? My client neither confirms nor denies... - Shut up. - Suck yourself! I'm setting in front of  you documents... which when signed, will honorably discharge you from United States army reserves. You're the drone guy, right? Lawyer, for the contractor? Your machine killed Rodriguez. You forced him out in the field. We were gonna strap that phone to a fucking mule.. till we found your two sorry asses And then we figured why waste a good mule? Private Rodriguez died a hero. Sign the documents, Mr Botwin. I'll need to look these over. There's no time to look over anything Mr Hodes. Suck yourself! You see that windows washer outside, cleaning the windows Mr Botwin? Notice, anything unusual? I don't know, should I? He's a white guy? Actually, he's a lithuanian. And that squeegee he's holding is a remote, currently erasing your hard drive, Mr Wilson. Would you confirm that for me? That's because ... ... that window washer, is not a window washer. He works for us. And that janitor in the hallway, he works for us too. Turn on your vacuum Ivan. Turn it off. Turn it on. Turn it off. Two vans in the parking lot, helicopters... You're fucking surrounded,dipshit! And we can make you disappear faster than a mule can shit itself. What's with him and the mules? Do you think we're fucking around here?! You return our property pronto, dickhead! Give him the phone. Give him the phone Doug! What am I signing here? You're not signing anything. You're not here right now. You were never at Fort Irwin and the only man named Rodriguez you know is some asshole in the Yankees thinks he's better than Graig Nettles. Suck yourself! Okay, you've walked the crime scene. You've interrogated your suspects. You've gathered your evidence. Which one of you, is ready to put your critical mind, to the ultimate, test. Who here has solved, the strange case, of Cordull high. Crimes, are solved by hard evidence. Blood samples point to Kyle and Jill, but, since both of them showed up at school later, there can be only one solution. There was no murder. Ah, but there was... A murder of the worst kind. For you see, Jill had an abortion. It's horrible, it's disgusting, but I have no place else to put you. You're just going to have to fake it for a bit. Hey Mom. What's up Nance? What are you doing here? Oh, just dropping off some business, getting a rundown on the operation, meeting the family. Uncle andy's back. He has a bag of ice on his balls. What's up little man ? Shane, go in the house with your brother Listen to your mother, Shane. She's a gangster she'll keep you staight. U-Turn, why don't you and I have a little walk and talk?
