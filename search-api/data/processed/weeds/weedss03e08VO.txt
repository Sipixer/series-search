All right, Fundis, tell me a story. A man flying a kite found Scottson. We think he was stuffed in a drainpipe until a grate busted in the rain and... Up came Pete. Can't you take something for that? I've tried everything, Captain. Well, pop a fuckin'breath mint. - What did you eat, pastrami? - On rye, Sir. What else, Fundis? Well, a close-range shot to the head. It's ugly. Who, why, when? I've been trying to figure that out since he went missing. You know, retracing his steps, asking... What's that? Summer reading from internal affairs. Quite the ripping yarn. Retracing his steps? How about covering your ass? You got another story you want to tell me, Fundis? My career just took a swan dive into a shitcan. I want to thank you for that. I'd like to thank Pete, too, since it appears he was the brains behind the skimming, extortion, wiretapping, evidence-planting operation you two had going. But good thing for us he turned up the way he did and we don't have to get honest. So here's the new story, agent asshole motherfucker choke-on-my-dick. You got three days to find whatever money is left over from your little side business, and before you clean out your locker for early retirement, take your uniform to the dry cleaner's 'cause we have a fucking hero to stick in the ground.

And when do you think that might be?</i> You get lost on your way to forest lawn? Never knew the man. Is Conrad around? Do you see Conrad? How about one time... just for laughs...

Abe Lincoln beat you to it. What else you got? I took care of your debt. You don't owe Marvin anything. I mean, you're gonna have trouble moving your shit on the streets, but you still have me.

Well, thanks. We don't hear that enough in this business. And that's a tragedy. I mean, the genre's been hijacked by amateurs, sure, but when I see your attention to detail... the framing, the risks you take... it makes this viewer... I guess you should know. - I've always wanted to... - Be in porn? Every caterer does. Well, I think I could be great.

How are you this afternoon, councilwoman? Smiling. You got my gift? Not why I'm smiling. But, yes, I did. Piece of advice... never send a woman a dress she might not fit into. - Did you try it on? - <i>It's a size 2.</i> Flattering and annoying at the same time. I thought your breasts would look good in red.</i> Well, it's a nice thought. Listen... I want to see you. Wear whatever dress you want or no dress at all. I'm almost divorced. Mazel tov. Would you... Like to help me celebrate? You know where I live. I do. I do, indeed. See you, councilwoman. Are you sure you want to do this? Yeah. All right, hold it up to your mouth and I'll light it. - How is it? - It's... kind of gross. You feel anything different? I feel like I want to brush my teeth. Maybe it's bad shit. But my dad gets it from your mom. You know... My mom's... A drug dealer? I saw her come over once. I didn't tell anyone. I won't tell anyone. Thanks. You gonna try it? Yeah. This is that moment where I finally become cool, right? No. Just stoned. Stop it. That's very funny, Tim. Open the door. Open the fucking door! You don't talk to me. - You can talk to me about anything. - No, I don't want to talk to you! Thanks. that was my first boob. How was it? Good. Do you want to touch my... you know?

My mom's a bitch. But I miss her. I don't know why. Do you feel stoned? I guess. I don't see what the big deal is. Yeah. I prefer beer. I prefer touching your boob. You want to make a buy? I said, would you like to make a buy? All right, let's just cut. Cut. You did great, kid, you really did. Come on up. You got your foot in the door -- or in this case, your foot in Jessica. - Hey, go get Lex. - Wait, wait ! That's it? "Thanks for the foot. go warm up the hot dogs"? - I've been working all day here. - What do you want, a medal? It's a job. And, yeah... go warm up the hot dogs. Well, that's bullshit. Hey, I'm talking to you, Paul St. Moritz! You know, I always stood up for pornography. I believed in it. I thought it provided an essential service, light up a young person's imagination, help a sexless marriage, keep a predator off the street! I thought porn was magical. Now I see it for what it really is. It's a flesh factory, and we are all slabs of meat. Lex here is not an unbelievably enormous dick. And I'm not a foot. - You're not a foot, Andy. - Thanks, Lex. We're human beings. I gave you my something special, and you ate it. You took something beautiful, like Jessica's vagina, and you made it just a place to put a foot. You need to do some soul-searching, my friend. This whole industry does. It exploits, it dehumanizes, it degrades men. Everybody back to one. {\}Back to one!{\} This is from Nancy. First time I ever took a check. She says she wants her fountain. Conrad! - And what's your name? - Judah. - And this is... - Sunshine. Is that right? Well, Mr. Judah, Ms. Sunshine, you tell the city of Agrestic we're impressed. And you tell Nancy if this check bounces... - She better start running. - I'll do that. Stop. - I want to, but I can't. - Stop. I have cancer. I had cancer. They cut them off. These are, uh... Spare parts. I don't care. - No, I need to leave my top on. - Celia Hodes, you're a smart, ambitious, sexy woman. I'm embarrassed. I haven't gotten hard on my own for two years. I've been popping magical boner pills. - Magical boner pills? - Yeah. I took one in your driveway half an hour ago. Do you like my penis any less? {\}Hmm?{\} No. No, I don't. We're used. It doesn't mean we can't be sexy. Doesn't mean we can't -- pardon my language, fuck like bunnies. Cool. If I still had feeling in my nipple, I bet that would be amazing. All right, enough. Listen to me. I barely know you. But the first time I saw you, there was something about you that was so familiar,</i> familiar in the best way. Like we shared something, like... we had a secret. I just want to know you. I don't know why. I just do. Okay. Stop talking. - Hello. - Hi Mrs., uh, botwin. - That's me. - I'm Valerie. You want to take a step up to the X-ray machine? Okay. - You're the doctor? - Oh, no, doctor's at lunch. I just take the X-rays. You can take out your breast. What? Oh, right. Right. Mammogram's nothing to be nervous about. - It'll be over in a minute. - Right. Sorry. I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing? You've got great breasts. These? You should see some of the jugs we get in here. Gravity's cruel. All right, lift up your breast and get as much of it onto the plate as you can. Just get it all on there. Just spread it out from the bottom. Just right on there. Yeah, no, that's great. That's great. Okay, now you're gonna feel a little bit of pressure when I lower the top. - Uh, uh... - And smush. Okay, I know it's probably uncomfortable, but I'm fast. Do you like this job? Are you locked in? Oh, yeah. Ready to go. I know who you are. Excuse me? I... know... who... you... are. So, Nancy Botwin, why are you here?
