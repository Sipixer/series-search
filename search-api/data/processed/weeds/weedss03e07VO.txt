- I left you a package in the garage. - Heroin? We need these votes. I'm thinking a golf membership. I don't play golf. What is it you do play, Celia? I play house. We're shooting a movie in one of our empty houses. Needs a caterer, you'll thank me later. Can you convince mom that I'm stuck in a classroom full of religious zealots, two klicks away from jihad? I like you, Nancy Botwin. I bet you look good rolling right out of bed in the morning. You've been fucking him the whole time you were married to me? It's just business between us, always has been. Agent Fundis, D.E.A. I'm here to talk about Peter Scottson. He hasn't come into work for a few days, and we haven't heard from him. Clinique here gon' take you and fuck the gay out of you. I can see your boner. Don't be embarrassed. That's what god's love is all about. I've been shot! Man, you think it was the mexicans? Cucaracha motherfuckers. Now, where's our crop? You get your fuckin' crops, and then we're done with your ass. It's over when I say it's over. U-turn, oh, my god. Call for help! I've been waiting a long time for this, motherfucker. U- turn's dead! He's dead! Weeds - Season 3 - Episode 07 He Taught Me How To Drive By Transcript by testexam Synch : Michvanilly / [dx] / Macanto, San-A Why exactly is he in a hot tub? The boat didn't fit. Oh, of course not. Look at his grand-mama crying over there in her designer dress. He sure was good to her. She gonna miss that gravy train. Someone should go over there and poke him. See if he flinch or something... just to be sure. He looks pretty dead to me. 'Sup, Two Strikes? Hey, Clinique, how you doing, baby? Oh, I'm fuckin' pregnant again. Some indian kid I mercy-fucked for U-turn. Oh, sorry. Y'all know each other? No, hi. Two strikes, is it? Nancy. Hello. I ain't giving this one up. Damn. I remember when he was just a wannabe, when we busted our carjacking cherries together. He taught me how to drive-by. Respect. Thank you. Don't think of this as a loss of identity. Think of this as an upgrade to a better way of life... Better services, better schools, better tax base. - This merger... - Oh, enough. Agrestic and Majestic are never gonna merge. I told them about your deal with Celia. Where are <I>our</I> houses? I was more than generous with all of you. Let's get an idea of how the vote's gonna go. I gotta get home for "Are you smarter than a 5th grader?" all in favor of a town merger with Majestic, say, "aye." - Aye. - All those against? NAY! Oh, the nays have it. Up your ass, Groff. Friends, this is a colossal mistake. Think of the people you represent. The votes aren't there... nothing more to say. Find yourself another town to swallow. Celia can help you. She's good at that. All right, not so fast, 4th grader. There is a way to bypass a city council on this issue. If it's put to a referendum, the town can decide. Referendum. Hell of an idea, councilwoman Hodes. - Whore. - Whore, whore. Whore... - You did that on purpose. - Hey, guys, come on, what's wrong with you people? Miss Hodes knows that this is good for Agrestic. Whatever. let's get out of here. I want to thank you for that. That's what <I>friends</I> do. I don't want to be your friend. Come home with me. What about lunch tomorrow? I'm not hungry for food. Well, maybe by then you will be. So, what does this mean for our debt? Are we off the hook? Depends on who makes new leader. Well, how does that work? - Is there an election? - What, you ain't get the ballot? There's Marvin, maybe he can shed some light. Hey, Marvin. - How you doing? - Okay. I know this must be really hard for you, losing your friend, your cuz, which could mean your cousin or not... I'm a little unclear... But also your leader. My dad and his moms were second cousins. Well, there you go. So, I just also wanted to say that it's been great getting to know you, - and maybe one day... - Wait... You think 'cause U-turn dead, you off the hook? - No? - Who's in charge now? Me. I'm the nigga in charge over here. You owe <I>me</I> now. You got a problem with that? No... It's just... it's a big job you're taking on, Marvin. I'm a big boy. How's your ass doing? How'd you know about that? - Nancy? - I didn't say anything, I swear. U- turn... he said something about it the other day when he paid me a visit. He said the mexicans popped you? You gonna take that shit on? I ain't afraid of those taco bells. - But I am gonna settle things right. - Settle? Call a meeting, figure something out before we all kill each other. You're goin' face-to-face? They gonna gun your big ass down for real this time. Not with her there, they won't. No one wants a dead white lady on their hands. Oh, I'm not sure I'm comfortable going to a gang summit. You ain't got no fucking choice. We goin' tomorrow. I thought you were going to summer camp. Too expensive with the divorce. Everything's a mess. So, what's the deal here? Watch. This is a case of betrayal. Judas did it. This is the strange case of the mad scientist. Big bang's a lie, and dinosaurs lived on earth the same time as man. - Shane Botwin! - What? If you're gonna shove your doctrine down our throats, at least be clever about it. I thought I was, but I guess you're just too smart for me. Perhaps you should take over, present something to the class that is mysterious to you. - Okay. - Okay! Stand up. I'd like to solve the mystery of the school that receives federal funding... yet promotes a religious curriculum in direct violation of church-state separation mandates. Sit down, Shane Botwin. Yes, sir. Jesus Christ. Exactly. How're you doing? You know, living the dream. - You? - How did you know Marvin got shot? U- turn never said anything about it that day. You really think you deserve to know the answer to that? I think that's what you wanted to talk to me about. Maybe I want to talk to you about how you kiss. Maybe that's a discussion for another time. Look, the mexicans are real pissed at Marvin for his part in the drive-by. U- turn's really pissed they shot Marvin in the ass. Maybe they didn't shoot him in the ass. Maybe someone else did it to make it look like the mexicans did it. Maybe someone did it to start a gang war and let all them motherfuckers kill each other so that <i>we</i> could all be free Don't go to this meeting. now he's concerned. What the hell was I supposed to do? Something. Maybe I was doing it. {\}Yeah{\}. Sorry I knocked over your plant. Wasn't my plant. I'm telling you, mom, I'm at a very impressionable age. And if you're not careful, this pedagogy will take root, and you'll end up with a right-wing narc on your hands. Hang tough, stick to your beliefs. Show a little character. I know you have it in you. They're fundamentalists. You're not getting out of summer school! I don't have anywhere else to put you. You're not sitting at home all day playing with my video games. - Don't say I didn't warn you. - Morning Mom, this is Tara. - Little early for a visitor, isn't it? - She slept over. - Silas... - Mom... ... Not after megan and quinn. I'm not going through this again. You're not gonna make me that mom. Tara, it's lovely to meet you. You seem like a nice girl. But my son isn't allowed to have sleepovers, and he knows this. Oh, we're not having sex, mrs. Botwin. I'm a virgin. - Oh, really? - I honor god mith my abstinence... Until the day I join my husband in marriage. - You don't say. - They're everywhere. It's true. we're abstaining. Well, good for you. I have a question. Do you really think evolution is a lie? Well, I believe that I'm descended from adam and eve and not a monkey. So, natural selection, darwinism, empirical data... None of that factors in for you? Evolution is just a theory. I mean, that's why they call it the theory of evolution and not the fact of evolution. Oh, what about... You've asked your question. now shut the fuck up. Silas, don't swear at your brother. Shane, don't antagonize Tara. Tara, keep saving it for the lord. Where the fuck's andy? Okay, everybody, that's lunch! Lexington steele? Oh, pleasure to meet you, sir! Andy botwin, huge fan! Not huge the way you're huge... admiration huge. - Thanks, bud. - Hey, I took you in the ass. Huh? Your dildo, the one they had molded from your dick. I was with a girl, israeli. she strapped it on. To be truthful, for me, too big... The dildo, not the girl. Gave me a little oose-lay oopy-pay, know what I mean? - Look, what's good on the menu? - Oh, what isn't good? I present you a mediterranean feast... - Hummus, baba ghanoush, couscous... - Got any beef? Oh, yeah, kebabs right there. So, does beef keep you hard? I just like beef. Oh, ladies, back away. One stray pube in the tabbouleh, the health department could shut down the whole buffet. Wait, look at you shaven mavens. I take it all back. Go ahead, step right up. - You're funny. - And cute... For a cook. - What's up? - Come in. Close the door. Fine, but we're keeping the shades open. Listen, I just had a development get shut down in phoenix because of some paperwork issues, and I need for that not to happen here. Be a doll and legalize my construction crew for me this afternoon. Look, I know this is not the most kosher thing in the world to do, so if you can't do it, I'll just fire you and hire someone who will. You have no idea how unkosher I can be. Now I'm intrigued. tell me more. Can I do this tomorrow? I have an appointment this afternoon. - An appointment? - It's a woman thing. Oh, well, it always is with you women. Okay, tomorrow. I got lunch. I figured we'd eat at one of those tables in the courtyard and... Nancy, I only have two sandwiches. I'm sorry. No problem, celia. You know, Sullivan, the fastest way to get those referendum signatures may be to have Nancy gather them. She has scads of sales experience. That's a great idea, celia. Yeah, you've got yourself a good little worker here. I'll be back later. Dude, if you are fucking with us, that is so not cool. They're rolling. These are my dishwashers. Over there Be cool.
