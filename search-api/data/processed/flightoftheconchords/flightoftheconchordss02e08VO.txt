is in, okay? - So you can go on. - How many? Uh, one... - yeah, one. - One? - Yeah. - Is it Mel? No, it's not, Bret. Actually, Mel was busy. She actually requested that she can't come today. But if she was here, yes, we'd have two. But unfortunately we're down to one today. - One person? - It's a big guy though, Jemaine. He's taking up three seats. He's got shopping bags with him. - Well, you can't count the shopping bags, can you? - There's three seats used. What, so the majority of the audience is shopping bags? Yeah, most of the audience are shopping bags. But don't look at it that way. Iook at it that there's three seats taken. - Yeah? - Okay. Just give this one big guy with the shopping bags the best gig of his life. Rock it out. One person. This is a new low. ¶ voodoo lover! ¶ thank you. Thank you... especially the one audience member for coming along today. Hey, when did he go? When did that guy leave? Yeah, he... he snuck out. Possibly as early as the first song. So we played this whole gig to an empty room? Technically yes. Well, technically you were there. Technically I actually snuck out as well. - You snuck out? - What do you mean you snuck out? I knew you were gonna get angry. Don't single me out. What about the other guy? He snuck out. - He's not our manager though. - I know. You've got to question yourselves. Why is the audience gone? Why is the manager gone? What's he doing leaving? Well, you went shopping. Oh, yeah. Anyway, zero people. This is a new low. All right, it's time to get the high points and low points graph out. And unfortunately, as of yesterday, we've hit a new low point... doing a gig to nobody. Pass it around. - That's the graph. - It's at zero. Wow. What's that high point? Yeah, that's when I didn't have to pay the meter. Remember the meter was broken when I parked outside your apartment? That's the high point of our career? That is the high point of us as a band in our career so far. I still think about it now. It was such a great night. But we're not concentrating on that now. Those times are gone. We're in the low now. We're in the lull. Well, how come no one comes to our gigs? I've tried to rack my brains to find that answe Bret. I think we're gonna have to face facts. You guys just don't look cool. L- I do. - No you don't. - No. - Don't I? - You may look cool in your mind, but when other people are looking at you they don't see what's happening inside your head. Okay? They can only see the outer shell. It doesn't matter anyway. It's about the music, not about the way you look. Maybe in the '70s, guys. But come on, get up with the '90s. - Times have changed. - It's not the '90s. Okay, my point is the difference between cool bands and you is hair. - I've got hair. - True. But most of your hair is body hair, isn't is, Jemaine? Well, some of it. Iook at this. Style. That's what we need. - I know what you're gonna say. - Uh... I knew you were gonna say that. But this is the stuff. Styling gel, okay? Have a look at these. What's this? Just some experiments I ran back in 1991 when I was trying to find my look. You should dress like this more often. - No, I've found my look now. - And that's your look? Yup, this is the winning look. A moss-green shirt and a tie? Obviously this is for work. Up here is for play, isn't it? No, this is it. This is the stuff. I really enjoyed it. The only problem is it's very powerful. - Okay? It takes hold of you. - Knock knock. Morning, prime minister. Guys, sit down, sit down. Thank you, m'lord. Murray, have you got an eraser? I'm doing a drawing but I've made a mistake. I'm working on a poster idea for my new campaign. - That is a good poster, sir. - Not bad. How about you guys? Are you excited about new zealandtown? - What's that? - Oh, I was gonna mention that. Well, you know Chinatown and little Italy, right? - Yeah. - Well, we want to establish a new zealandtown - right here in new York city. - Where's it gonna be? Well, it's gonna be one block between Chinatown and little Italy, which isn't exactly accurate geographically, but it's perfect for our needs. We're gonna have Gary the sheep. - He's flying over from new zealand. - Really? Yes, new zealand's most famous sheep is gonna be there. - He's on hiatus. - We have a chap shearing him. - Well, pretending to shear him. - Be mime shearing him. Mime shearing him because Gary's got his look. We can't mess with that. And while I'm on that, um, what we need is a cool band to play there. And I know you guys are sometimes involved in music, - so what I was gonna ask... - would you like us to play? - Well, no, we're looking for a cool band. - They are available. We're considered quite cool, aren't we? - In their minds, yes. - I see. - Yeah, you want a cooler band. - No, exactly. If you really want to help, we do need someone to work the information booth. - You guys keen? - No. Great. Hey, greg, have you got an eraser? Did you hear that, guys? The prime minister is looking for a cool band. Don't touch it. Ew! How's that? That looks cool. - Whoa, that is cool. - Yeah? You look like a punk rocker. Quite cool. - Very cool. - Very cool look, man. Totally cool. - Pretty cool. - Cool. ¶ fashion ¶ ¶ f-f-f-f-fashion, f- fashion ¶ ¶ s-s-s-style, the l-l-l-l-look ¶ ¶ I'm the vanguard, I'm the air, I'm nouveau ¶ ¶ I'm the shi shi, ooh-whee-he ¶ ¶ I'm the man ala mode ¶ ¶ I'm the edge, I'm the chic ¶ ¶ I'm the taste, I'm larger than life ¶ ¶ with just a hint oflace ¶ ¶ p-p-p-p-president reagan ¶ - ¶ thatcher ¶ - ¶ t-t-t-thatcher ¶ ¶ jazzercise ¶ - ¶ l-l-l-lip gloss ¶ - ¶ oh-oh ¶ ¶ you think you know fashion ¶ ¶ well, fashion's a stranger ¶ ¶ you think fashion's your friend ¶ ¶ my friend, fashion is danger ¶ - ¶ posing ¶ - ¶ posing at the bar ¶ - ¶ posing ¶ - ¶ posing sitting down ¶ - ¶ posing ¶ - ¶ posing in the distance ¶ - ¶ posing ¶ - ¶ posing with my arm ¶ - ¶ posing ¶ - ¶ posing with my leg ¶ - ¶ posing ¶ - ¶ posing like a swan ¶ - ¶ posing ¶ - ¶ posing for a portrait ¶ ¶ posing a threat ¶ ¶ hey, hey hey hey ¶ ¶ hey yeah ¶ ¶ oh ¶ ¶ you think you know fashion ¶ ¶ we'll, fashion's a stranger ¶ ¶ you think fashion's your friend ¶ ¶ my friend, fashion is danger ¶ ¶ moscow, berlin, Paris, London ¶ ¶ tokyo, wellington, rome, geneva ¶ ¶ new York city, new-new-new-new York city. ¶ Murray, wow, these guys are pretty cool. Who are they? That's Bret and Jemaine. You know, my band. They're bloody great. You guys seem a little cooler than usual today. Yeah, we're a little bit cooler now. Yeah, usually you wear clothes from the '70s. They're not from the '70s. They're from new zealand. Isn't that the same thing? Similar, I suppose. - Hey, guys. Whoa, looking cool. - Whatever, Murray. Hey, great gig last night. You got a glowing review. "New zealand consulate newsletter"... "they came, they saw, they conchord. A couple of cool guys took to the stage and wowed the audience with music and up- to-the-minute styles. Move over, refrigerators, here's what's cool." - That's pretty cool, man. - You like that? - Yeah. - The best part is the prime minister wants you to perform at the new zealandtown opening ceremony. Oh, that's cool, but yeah, whatever. I've got to go. You guys want to hang out tomorrow still or... - whatever, man. - Whatever, David. - G'day, you guys. Cool hair. - Hey. Wow, you're gonna make quite an impact with that hair, aren't you? - Oh, yeah, that hair. - That hair there is whoo. Nice attitude, Jemaine. I like it. - Go away, Murray. - "Go away." Did you hear that, prime minister? So cool. Anyway, I'd like you all to meet Paula. Paula's the new zealand tourism board representative and she's gonna be working with us on the new zealandtown opening day celebration. - Yeah. - Hello, I'm Murray. - Paula, Murray. - Stop shaking her hand. Paula grew up next to me. - 39 harcourt street, Nelson. - Yeah. Mind you, that was all a very very long time ago. - Many many years ago now. - Oh, yes, years. A lot's happened since then. Things change. - Yeah. - People get married to other people. Yeah. Anyway, Murray, Paula's second in command after me and then you and then greg. Oh. So if I wanted to, I could tell her to do something and then she'd tell you to do it. - But I could tell greg. - That's at your discretion. Let's just test out this new system, shall we? Paula, could you please ask Murray what time it is? Um, hey, Murray, have you got the time? 2:00. It's 2:00, prime minister. Yes, I heard and I think he heard me. On a basic level this works, but I think we could use more development. Anyway, I'll see you later, guys. And did you ask Jemaine about that thing? Not yet. - See you guys. - Bye, guys. What thing? It's... we'll talk about it soon during the band meeting. Right, band meeting. Jemaine, present. Bret? - Yeah, whatever. - Okay, whatever. Murray, present. Now with the new zealandtown, I've decided we should really look at our cultural heritage. I think we should have a traditional maori village. You know, get a couple of maoris standing there in their natural environment. But this is new York. Yeah, well, we'll get some bushes in. We'll get a log. Get some wind running through it. I think the most important part is to get a maori warrior. That would really sell it. So do we know any maoris, Jemaine? Actually, you're part maori, aren't you? No, I'm not doing it. - But you are part maori? - Yes, but I'm not doing it. - Please? - No. - Please be the maori. - No. Well, if you don't do it we're gonna have to get Mexicans. You can't get Mexicans to do it. That's culturally insensitive. We've already signed one up so it can't be too sensitive. Is he gonna do it? No, prime minister, he's not gonna do it. See you later, guys. - Whatever. - See ya, Murray. Good morning, Jemaine. Your hair doesn't look very cool. What? Why didn't you tell me earlier? - Oh, yours looks bad. - Does it? - I need a bit more gel. - Pass me the hair gel. Hey, where's the gel gone? What happened to all the gel? What do you mean, what happened to the gel? It was in there. You know what happened to the gel. You used it. Did you finish the gel on your body hair? N... no. You've been gelling your beard. Your beard looks good. - You used my half of the gel. - What are you doing? What are you doing? Put it down. Oh! That was very dangerous. - How dare you throw this at me? - Do not throw that at me. I think it's a fitting revenge for you throwing it at me. Oh! That was dangerous. Paula, how many toothbrushes have we got so far for the replica of the toothbrush fence? 46. but I know someone who's bringing in another two. Yeah, well, that's still not 50 and we need 50 really for an effective replica. Can you talk to Murray about organizing some more? Murray? Um, okay. Hi, everyone. We need more toothbrushes. - I'll bring one in. - Thanks, greg. Good work, Paula. Thank you. Now, Murray, the attractions... how are they coming along? Well, I've booked you a tour bus to take all the people through new zealandtown. Great. Excellent. Can I drive the bus? Don't think that's a very good idea. The prime minister of new zealand driving a bus? Please? Please, Murray? - All right then. - Excellent. I get to drive the tour bus. Well, Gary, you must be jet-lagged. Let's get you off to your accommodations. Did you ever think I'd end up being prime minister, Paula? No. Complete surprise to me. Maybe we should go get some more gel. - We can't go out there. - Why not? There's people. They'll see us. No one can see me like this. - You go. - No, I can't go out there. Not without gel. We'll wait till there's no one out there. Who is it? - Who is it, Bret? - Who is it?! Come on, cool dudes, open up, it's me. - You can't co in. - What? Am I not cool enough for you now? - We've run out of gel. - What? Open up, come on. We've run out of gel. We look stupid. I'm sure you don't look that stupid. Open up. Oh my God! Oh, it's terrible. What have you done? We've used all that gel you gave us. - The whole bottle? - Can you get us some more gel? Yeah, all right. I've got things to do. I've got to go to the quarantine, pick up the grass patch for new zealandtown. I'll get you some gel on the way back, all right? Close that door and don't let anyone see you. There's still some gel. There's still a little bit of gel. - You're imagining the gel. - There's still some. There's no gel left. It's not there. Where is he? He's probably just dropped the gel and he's had to go back and get some more. What if he's keeping the gel for himself to make himself look good? Don't think so, man. That big ginger head of his looking great. Welcome, everybody. Cheers. You'd better hide that beer, sir. You can't drink in public over here. Well, we're in new zealandtown now. There's nothing they can do about it. Actually, bryan, you can't drink and drive either. Oh, you're quite right. Thank you, Paula. Well, I'm bryan the prime minister of new zealand and, um... I'm... I'm sorry, I'm just a little bit nervous. I haven't done this r a while. - The attractions. - Oh, Murray, thank yo yes, well, we've got a few interesting things to show you on our journey to new zealand so... let's go. Oh my goodness me. Iook at that. Quiet, everyone. It's some genuine native maori warriors. We don't want to disturb them in their natural habitat. If you'd like to take pictures, do it very very quietly. All right, if everyone's finished taking pictures, let's move on. Okay, everybody off. That was new zealandtown. Oh. This place is really a mess. Some milk for my piggies. Mel? Hey, guys. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be at your band meeting for the new zealandtown opening. Do you have a key to our apartment? This isn't my place, is it? This is your place. I must be sleepwalking. Oh no, don't wake me. You could kill me. Do you have any gel? Um, I don't know. I might have some mousse maybe. - Yeah? - Or some hairspray. Yeah, just a little mousse would be good. Bird watching. I love to watch birds. Where's your mousse? Is it not in here? Maybe not in this pocket. This is my sock. Oh, well... I guess I don't have any, guys. - You said you had some. - I said I thought I might have some. You said you had mousse. Jemaine, she said she had mousse. I'd better go before I wake up. You come in here without any mousse? What's wrong with you? I don't know who you are anymore. Do you have any gel, Mel? There's a little bit in here. Bret. Glue? - This should work. - Yeah yeah, this is good. It's just like gel. Same viscosity. Welcome, everyone. Now new zealand has always been a land of innovators. We were the first country in the world to research and develop the concept of a spreadable butter that can be used straight from the refrigerator. So it's in that great spirit of innovation that we are gathered here today to celebrate the opening of new zealandtown. Like Chinatown or little ethiopia, and also similar to little Italy. Jemaine, I stuck my head to my hand. - You idiot, Bret. - You've got a pillow on your head. - What? Where? - Other side. - Oh, we're both idiots. - Idiot, man. What are you sitting there so relaxed for, Bret? And get that cushion off your head, Jemaine. We had no gel so we used glue instead. You were supposed to bring us some gel. Shivers, I forgot your gel. Iook, I've been so caught up with new zealandtown. Iook, I'll solve it. Hi, greg, I need some anti-glue. What's anti-glue, Murray? Well, it's anti-glue, isn't it? It gets rid of glue. I don't think that exists, Murray. Just get it, okay? It's an emergency. Thank you. Now please, can you get ready? You don't need us. You've got new zealand's most famous sheep. Well, that's the whole thing, Jemaine. I don't. He's been shorn off. The guy who was supposed to mime shear him sheared him for real. - He's basically bald. - Gary's bald? Yes. So there's your star, timid and nervous. And to make matters worse, the guy next to him barbecuing... I think he's barbecuing lamb. Gary can tell. He's livid. And by the way, who's manning the information booth? What side of the road do you drive on? The middle. What language do you speak there? We pretty much just make it up as we go along. Really? Yeah, that's why the people from there are so hard to understand. We can't do it. We're not cool enough. Guys, do you want to know a secret? It wasn't the gel that made you cool. It wasn't? It was the confidence the gel gave you. When you started to feel good about yourself everyone else could feel that. And they started to feel good about you. Really? Maybe. Bret, I think we've got a gig to perform. - Yeah. - Get us the anti-glue. All right then. Who likes to "rock the party"? Now it gives me great pleasure and pride to introduce two of the coolest new zealanders I have ever met, our very own flight of the conchords. - Thank you. - Thank you. ¶ I like to rock the party ¶ ¶ party going on ¶ ¶ and it looks like... ¶ yeah, it was the hair gel, guys. Sorry. - We're not cool? - No. This is a new low, isn't it? Yeah. Murray, what happened to new zealandtown? This was a complete disaster. Well, I thought that was relatively successful. Yes, it went very well. Well done, Paula. I think I'm gonna head back to my hotel 'cause I've got to fly out in the morning. - Oh, do you? - Yeah. Okay. - Nice to meet you. - Bye. Yeah. - Paula. - Yes, bryan? Um, I... nothing.
