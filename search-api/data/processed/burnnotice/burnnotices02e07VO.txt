You're blacklisted. When you're burned, you've got nothing. No cash, no credit, no job history. You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in. - Where am I? - Miami. You do whatever work comes your way. You rely on anyone who's still talking to you. - A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - Should we shoot them? An old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI... You know spies... A bunch of bitchy little girls. Family, too... Is that your mom again? If you're desperate. Someone needs your help. Bottom line... Until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere. Your arms-dealer friend couldn't just meet us at the Caf√© Carlito? He wanted to meet here. I bought an assault rifle from him last year. He doesn't know you. - Seymour has trust issues. - I don't want to date him, Fi. I just want to find out what the people who burned me are doing with a Russian sniper rifle. And Seymour's the perfect guy to track it down. He's just a little... eccentric. When you work with people, you want to know everything about them...</i> their history, their associates, who's contacting them. That Seymour? - That... that Seymour? - Oh, no. This guy I met. He just asked me out. Although sometimes there are details you'd rather not know.</i> Fiona, baby, good to see you. Michael, right? Hey, man. Heard a lot about you. Come on. We're going for a walk. Fiona, keep Jackass company. He'll like you. He's attracted to shiny objects. So, Fi tells me you want a gun. Rifle, actually. Well, I got plenty. What do you need? I got semi, automatic, european. - I need a Dragunov, actually. - Wow. Yeah. Nice gun. Of course, there are not too many of them floating around. - How about a nice Romanian PSL? - No, I'm not looking to buy, Seymour... Hold that thought. I got business I got to attend to here. Don't tell me. Don't tell me. Vladimir, right? Pavel. Anyway, you got my money? I got to count it first. So, what? They don't teach arithmetic in the Ukraine? We're Bulgarian. I don't even know what you just said. The deal was 100 grand, okay? Not 50. Are you trying to rip me off? Nobody rips me off. Wow. Fiona said you were a bad-ass. - This is really none of my business. - Well, it is now. And this is the part where we haul ass. No, no. Okay. Michael, we'll talk later, okay? Let's go, Jackass! Punch it, man! They're shooting at us! If you're driving a sports coupe, you're not going to be able to lose an off-road vehicle off road.</i> Your best bet is to get them on the road,</i> where you have the advantage. It's less about speed than it is about maneuverability.</i> You need to put yourself in a position</i> where you can do something that they can't.</i> The <i>Subbers in Black</i> presents... Transcript : www.YyeTs.net Synchro : Salomon www.subbers-in-black.com Okay, then, what about Gerda from East Berlin? You remember her? I wanted to invade the Soviet bloc in 1983 just for her. Hey, Mike. You remember Virgil? Mike. I brought us some tall cool ones. I seem to recall you promising to stay out of Miami. Last time I saw you, there were people looking for you... angry people with guns. That's... That's all blown over. I was planning on staying away, but... He needs help, Mike. Well, not for myself. I had a partner in the repo business, a fella the name of Jay Flores. He died several years back. His daughter, Marcela, runs a medical-relief agency in town. They got hit hard. Big shipment of medicine got ripped off. Virgil's trying to track it down and needs backup. Backup? I figured that was in your wheelhouse. - She doesn't have anywhere else to turn. - Can't hurt to talk to her. Mm, it could. It could hurt a little. Could hurt a lot. Come on. Gathering intel, lending tactical support to a worthwhile mission. I mean, this is our old gig, Mike. This is why signed up back in the day. Fine, I'll talk to her. All right. Oh, mind if I use your phone? I need to call Madeline. - Yeah, about that. - Special lady. There's a magnetic thing about her... Irresistible. She offered to put me up, so I need to get on over th... You'll stay here. You tell her you can't make it and you'll call her when you're back in the Bahamas. Mike, you serious? Last time you were in town, you nearly got her killed. That's not going to happen again. Okay. Mike, I'm telling you, you're not gonna regret this. Marcela's done great things with this clinic. They send medicine to kids in every country of the world that has diseases. Kick it, kick it! Hey, no ball on the sidewalk. He started it. I see you brought the cavalry. Listen, if anyone can find this stuff, it's these two. We really need your help. Well, why don't you start by telling us what we're looking for. We spent months on a fund-raiser for kids in Rio. Shipped nearly $1 million worth of medicine. Yesterday, an hour out of Miami, these guys boarded the freighter, took everything. Well, unless they're starting a medical clinic, they're gonna want to sell this stuff. Whatever this stuff is worth on the black market, it's nothing compared to what it means to those kids. - If you can bring it back... - We'll see what we can do. Thank you so much, Michael. I've been meaning to move these out here for ages. Any particular reason why you had to do everything today? Uh, just spring cleaning. You know. So, have you heard from Virgil? Virgil? Yeah. He called and said that he was coming into town to see you and Sam. You know Virgil... just being Virgil. I... Yeah, I got to... Yeah? Mikey, good news. We got to head up to Boca. Got a lead on a guy who deals in black-market pharmaceuticals. That could be our way in. I was thinking we could head up there and check it out. Just the two of us? Yeah, yeah. Virgil's gonna see some friends while he's here in town. Friends? Yeah, I think it would be better if I went with him to Boca. Okay, sure. That's a good idea. It would be good for you guys to have some bonding time. Listen, Virgil needs to ask you just a little favor. Listen, I didn't pack enough underwear, so I borrowed a set of your boxers... the blue ones with the stripes.</i> They will never fit you. Stay out of my closets. They're a little snug down under, but I got all packed in... Appreciate it. Mike, be glad you didn't have to see that. Someone staying in the loft? Yeah, good old Sam, back in the loft. You don't say. Yeah. I'm gonna go, mom. That store there... It's owned by a guy named Feldman. In the last few years, a bunch of ships have been robbed the same way. Thieves are in and out in five minutes. They like to hit pharmaceutical shipments. And this guy likes to buy them. Hell, he's a one-man pharmacy. He got caught some time ago for selling vicodin taken off some boat in Naples. Charged with receiving stolen property, but his lawyer got him off. Doing a pretty brisk business now, it appears. Michael, this thing with your mama and me... I know you're uncomfortable about... I'm not uncomfortable. You attract bullets. It's too risky. Come on. What's a few bullets? You know what? I've got enough here. I'll run down to the photo store, and then you and I can run in and raise a little hell. Can I help you? My friend here is looking for a 5-iron. Graphite shaft, nothing too heavy. And $1 million worth of high-grade pharmaceuticals stolen off a freighter a couple of days ago. Excuse me? I sell golf equipment. I don't know what you're talking about. Really? I mean, this is nice golf equipment. But this store isn't paying for that Porsche out back. You are selling something else. Would you look at this. - Who are you? What is this? - Quite a clientele. Banker, superior-court judge. We thought we'd mail everybody a copy of their photo coming out of this store in one of these lovely, handsome frames. All right, just stop. This guy came by. I sell viagra, vicodin, and, and trancs. What am I gonna do with $1 million worth of antivirals? Who is this guy, anyway? His name's Gerard. He's a total psycho. You are gonna call Gerard, and tell him you have a buyer for his drugs. No, no. That's insane. I can't... I can't call him. What will the neighbors think? They've been living next to a drug dealer! - He seemed so nice. - All right, all right. - I'll get you a meeting. - And... - Throw in one of those shirts. - Yeah, sure. Well, it sounds like you and Virg made some progress. You found our thief. Yeah. I'm told he's a total psycho. You know, this is the reason why I don't look forward to Virgil's visits. One of the reasons. Listen, we're in the home stretch here. We got to get medicine out in the open. Look, I'll run point, okay? I'll go in as a buyer. - Fine. The sooner we get this done... - I'm all over it, Mikey. So, you gonna hook up with Fi's arms-dealer friend? How's that going? Yeah, another total psycho. Seymour, you might have mentioned we were going to a gun buy. That Jackass I call a bodyguard... he's worthless. So I figured you come along as backup, and I'd know for sure you're not a cop. See? Kill two birds, right? - Whoa, whoa, what's this? - You said you wanted a gun. No, no, no. I wanted information about a sniper rifle. Oh, right. The Dragunov. I mean, I could maybe import one from this guy in the Czech Republic. No, I'm not looking to buy a sniper rifle, Seymour. I just need to track down a place where someone can calibrate it. Do me a favor. Wave at that guy. Uh, if I'm not mistaken, that's one of the guys who shot at us. He's bringing the rest of the money. See? 50 g's. Why wave at him? I told him, you and me, we don't have a beef with him anymore. We... we, Seymour, do not have a beef with him. - You have a beef with him. - Whatever. Look, look, here he comes. And he's not bringing your money. He has a gun. I'm not a part of this. Damn it. I told him. I talked to him. For certain kinds of criminals, partying hard serves an important management function.</i> You can keep your eye on your employees during the off hours</i> and keep them spending money... ... so they're hungry for the next score.</i> - Scotch and soda. - You Finley? I am. You're Gerard? Get out of here. Yeah, Feldman said you'd be by. He didn't tell me a whole hell of a lot. - So, you're what, a gun dealer? - I deal in everything... Guns so people can shoot each other, medicine to get them ready for round two. Even Somali warlords need penicillin, my friend. So, I hear you're in, uh, acquisitions. Hostile takeovers. I got a client breathing down my neck for antivirals. Feldman said you had a shipment to spare. Antivirals. That's bad timing. I sold those a couple hours ago. Well, that's a shame. I assume they haven't been delivered yet. Maybe they can be unsold. My client has deep pockets. Deal's done. We deliver next week. Excuse me a second. Why don't you calm down and go play with your boyfriend? Bar fights aren't just a way to blow off steam.</i> They're a great way to showcase your leadership skills,</i> and they're a team-building exercise. Watch it, there. A broken bottle can hurt someone. There's also no better way for someone new to get noticed.</i> If this guy Gerard sold the medicine, what can we do? Maybe we could get the cops to sting the buy. Buyer shows up, cops swoop in. We don't know when the delivery is. And if the cops get involved, Gerard might find out. No, forget it. Wait a minute. I got an in with this guy. We can use that to find out where he's keeping this medicine. We just need an inside man. An inside man? What does that mean? He wants me to join Gerard's crew so I can find out where he hides the stuff that he steals. - No, Sam, I can't. - Mikey, Come on. Let me just pitch a whole new heist, something where he's got to bring you in. We'll never actually have to do it. It has to look good, get him talking. Virgil, can you get us a yacht just for show? You know, I think I probably can. I helped a rich guy out in Fort Lauderdale... sank his catamaran before his ex-wife could get it. He might be in an accommodating frame of mind. Guys, you think you can find the medicine? I have no idea, but we got to give it a shot. Michael, you home? You are not here. Aren't you gonna invite me in? Oh, I'm in a hurry, ma. I'm going to meet Fi. Well, but I made you this. You baked a pie? Okay, I just sprinkled cinnamon on it. But I thought maybe you could share it with Sam... - and Virgil. - Virgil? Michael. Michael, I may not be a superspy, but I'm not an idiot. All right, I got a call from Virgil, saying... some story about being stranded in the Bahamas with boat trouble. I mean, that wouldn't fool a 2-year-old. So, what's going on? Nothing is going on. I have to go to work. But if I hear from Virgil, I'll let you know. Can I walk you to your car? I can walk myself. Okay. I'll call you later. Keeping Virgil away from your mom is just about keeping her from danger? What else would it be? They did have a connection, Michael. A romantic connection. An intimate, steamy connection. I'm just saying, you know, when an important woman in your life meets someone, it can be an adjustment. Is this about your date? Because I'm fine with it. I don't think so, Michael. Not one question about who he is? You're not the least bit interested? No, I'm not interested. I thought spies were meant to be good liars. You are getting rusty. How you doing? Jackass... fruit smoothies for my friends. That's all he's good for. And lay off the wheat grass, will you? Hey, guess what. That Ukrainian guy finally paid me my money, and here is your cut. Seymour, we don't work together. No more tests, no more buys, no more Bulgarians. I just want information about where I can get a certain rifle serviced. Oh, right, the Dragunov. Yes. Do you know anyone in Miami who would modify, calibrate it? I just want a name and to keep it quiet. Yeah. I'll make some calls. Thank you. But first, you got to have a fruit smoothie. If you want to be a bad-ass, you got to eat healthy, right? What? I made them just for you. He doesn't like fruits? I thought you and me... bad-asses, yeah! Scotch and soda. Make it two. Nice to see you survived yesterday's little brawl. Some people don't understand their place in the food chain. Not afraid to get your hands dirty. I like that. I got a job for you. No, thanks. I don't do work for hire. Then consider yourself a partner in a very lucrative business opportunity. What do you know about designer performance enhancers? You mean like steroids? More like steroids on steroids. I know a lab that makes undetectable stuff... Next generation. Human tissue. 100% biological. It's worth millions. They're, uh, running a shipment up north in a yacht. You want us to hit it? Shipment's worth $2 million. You'd get a third. How does that sound? A third sounds like work for hire. Half sounds like a partnership. All right, done. You handle the heist, but you got to bring in a pro to keep the drugs at the right temperature and humidity. You got someone in mind? Yeah. He works at the lab. His name is Jackson. He used to cook meth before he got into designing steroids. You're gonna convince him to help. Convince him? I'm sure you can be persuasive. - Why don't you do it? - Me? Oh, no. No, in my line of work, you stay in the shadows. So the name Finley is never mentioned. We clear on that, partner? Dealing with an aggressive adversary isn't always about showing strength.</i> You Jackson? Sometimes it's best to show weakness. If they believe they can dominate you, they'll drop their guard.</i> Of course, that means getting dominated. A heist? Seriously? No, no, no. I'm a chemist. I don't do heists. Guys with guns, violence... that's why I got out of meth! I mean, it's... it's just not my thing. It makes my chest tight. - Can't breathe. - I can stop your breathing real quick. Please, you don't want to do this. Guys that own the lab are chechenyans. I mean, if they ever found out that I was in on it... Don't worry. They're not gonna know it was you. Can I get that as a guarantee? Can you put that in writing? Here's a guarantee. You do this, we never see each other again, and you make some money. You don't... That's the guy that moves the stuff. He takes off in the morning. - How big's the cargo? - Six cannisters. Not so big. - What do we need to do with them? - You got to pack it in coolers. You got to get it inside a custom liquid-air rig ASAP, as soon as... Because you let this stuff warm up, and it's is a nasty cocktail. I can train one of your guys to move it off the boat. - One of my guys. You're the guy. - What? No, no. I got a thing with boats and water, and I get... I get... I get seasick. I mean, look at me. Can you crack a window? We'll scrounge up some dramamine. - Then they'll recognize my face. - We'll get you a mask. All right, well, if we're gonna do this, man, Then I need to know where... where this stuff's going, all right? Is it a warehouse? Is it a garage? You don't need to know. We'll store it. Come on, I mean... power issues, humidity. Have you been outside? Look, you tell me what you need, and we'll set you up, all right? Now, look at that. Old guy's got a girlfriend. Uh, can we, uh, can we go before, you know, somebody recognizes me? I don't know who, but someone. Madeline. What are you doing here? I followed you from Michael's loft. Did Michael tell you to stay away from me? Look, Maddy, sweetie, listen, he's just looking out for you. See, the thing is, I tend to attract bullets and he just doesn't want you to get hurt. Well, you can tell Michael that I can take care of myself. Madeline, I'm kind of in the middle of something right now, and you need to leave. Now. Please, Madeline. Can I... can I know about the storage space, the room temperature, the sunlight sensitivity? I mean, we got to have these at a certain temp range. I'll tell you what, talk to Evan about what you need. We'll get it to you. - It's gonna take a while. - Take your time. You'll have all night. You're staying with us till we pull this job tomorrow. He never leaves your sight. I got to call in sick. You're not calling anybody. What's gonna happen when I don't show up? I got to call the office. I got to leave a message. They'll think something's wrong if I don't show up. One call, and I'll be listening. Not a good time, Michael. I'm going to a movie. Boris, it's... it's Jackson. Yeah I'm not gonna make it into the office. What's going on, Michael? The doc said that I can't get out of bed. So, I came down with something, so... If you need anything, you can call me at extension One Eight Two Zero. - All right. - One... Hey, Fi. Michael just called me from a bar. Does the number 1820 mean anything to you? Yeah, a place in the marina. Why? I'm gonna miss my movie. When you need to distract someone without raising suspicions,</i> it helps to play to preconceptions. Tourists are fat, old people are cranky, and girls can't drive. What the hell? Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I was putting on my makeup, and I didn't see you, and... Oh, let me give you my insurance information. So silly. Okay. How about just your number, and we'll call it even. Okay. Do you have a pen? - Do you have a pen? - Sorry, nope. Do you have a pen? They're not letting me leave. Tell Sam the fake heist is on for real now. I missed my date. Thank you. They're getting ready, Sam. How much longer? We'll be there. We're just trying to do this right. Mikey's donating his fridge to the cause. Better look good. Gerard's got to believe the drugs he's stealing are real if he's gonna lead us to his stash. We got it covered. We're just trying to find a place to put Mike's yogurt while we do the job. How's he doing? Fine. I wish they'd smack him around a bit. I had to tell my date I got food poisoning. Come on, Fi, don't be like that. I don't want him dead, just bruised. Hurry up. Looks like the show's starting. Counterfeiting pharmaceuticals is pretty straightforward.</i> Fill some vials with your choice of beverage.</i> The trick is to keep people from looking closer.</i> With some compressed gas from your local farming-supply store</i> and a few cryogenic containers, you can convince people that if they get a little too curious,</i> they could lose a finger to frostbite. Where... Where... Where's my mask? I need my mask. You don't need one. What are you talking about? I told you the guy on the boat will recognize me if I don't got a mask, so I need a mask! Let him. He can tell it to the fishes. The fish? What are... You're gonna kill him?! Trust me, Jackson, it's better this way. No loose ends. Dealing with a trained operative is like playing chess with a master.</i> Dealing with criminals, on the other hand,</i> is like playing checkers with a 3-year-old.</i> They like to change the rules. Well, I need a gun. I need a gun. - Give me a gun! - You said you didn't want one. Yeah, well, that was before I knew people were gonna be shot. And if you're gonna shoot people, they're gonna shoot back. And if they shoot back, they'll probably hit me. So I need a gun. I'm not going on the boat unless I... - You happy? - Yeah. Using a zodiac to catch a yacht has certain advantages.</i> It's low to the water, so it's hard to see coming.</i> It tops out at a brisk 60 miles per hour,</i> and it's designed to turn on a dime. Of course, the one disadvantage is, it can make for a bumpy ride.</i> Take anything you want... the boat, anything. Where's the shipment? Sealed cannisters in the fridge. Get to the bow. Find them. Virgil, go with this. You shut up! I don't even know what you're talking about. Shut up! I've never met you before in my life. - Did I miss something? - Yeah. He says he knows me. ... I do know you. You're that... that guy... No, no! Shut up! Stop saying that! - Everyone's gonna know you did this. - I don't know what you're talking about. Navy Seals are trained to hold their breath</i> for three to five minutes underwater. If you're an ex-Navy Seal, you'll probably still have the chops,</i> but there's only one way to find out. Oh, god, what did I do? Good for you. You broke your cherry. Hey, do you want to lose a finger?! - What's the matter? - Put that down! Put that down! You'll lose a finger you keep doing that. You have no idea what you're doing. This is my work, and I don't want it messed up by some idiots! - What did you say? - I say you're idiot! Let it go. Come on! Load them up. Load them up. Great. Maybe even laid. Let's just make sure we get this stuff into storage. We can't let it spoil. You know, I'm not gonna be responsible for this if, you know... Stop worrying about the storage space, you'll be fine with it. I almost slipped. Looks like Mike's got them hooked pretty good. Now let's see if they lead us back to where they're hiding the antivirals. I'm fine, I'm fine. Watch out for the fence. It's rusty. There you go. Don't lose them, Fi. I know how to tail a car. Well, there's no barbed wire, just one guard with a Beretta, so getting in shouldn't be a problem. We wait for Mike and Gerard and the guys to leave, and we'll make our move. Well, why not go in now? Because Mike could get hurt. Doesn't sound so bad. What is this place? Big office-supply company uses it for inventory. We got a guy on the inside, keeps us off the paperwork. We got building security on the payroll, too. Aren't you, you know, afraid someone might find your stuff? In here? Good luck! Everything you need's right up here. Oh, okay. All right, this will do, okay. Now, you're gonna have to have power sources clear because this thing will suck up a lot of juice. Okay? Yeah, oh, all right, good. Now, listen, my rig will generate a lot of heat. So if you have anything that's yours that's nearby that's pharmaceutical, it'll fry it. Is this yours? Any of this yours? Don't worry about it. All our other stuff is scattered around, nothing nearby. Oh, yeah? Oh, good. Oh, good. Okay, so, then... then... Yeah. Yeah, that will work out. I just need to go out to the van and get some tools. Give him a hand. He's waving us off. Guess we're not going in, then. That's the warehouse he hides the medicine in. But the medicine... it could be anywhere. So we got to the end zone and no touchdown. You wanna search through 10,000 boxes? Be my guest. Sounds like the world's worst game show. Sorry about the fridge, Mike. It was kind of a last-minute thing. Hungry? I've got to do something. Where's that warehouse? I'm going down there. Maybe there's somebody I can know. Virgil, it's not gonna work. No. We... ... we got to get Gerard to move the medicine. We do that, and we might be able to get it back. You got any ideas? Yeah. I think it's time to bring back the mysterious Mr. Finley. I like where you're going. I just want my money. Can I have my money? Can I have my money, man? I just want my money! - What the hell is wrong with you? - You said this was a simple heist. You never said Chuck Finley was involved. So Finley's involved. What's the big deal? What's the big... You have no idea, do you? You don't get it. Yeah you don't get it. We're dead. We're dead. We are dead. What are you talking about? He's the buyer. Chuck Finley's the buyer? Man. You don't get it. He comes in. He gets you to bite on a job. He tells you a story. He says I deal in everything. I got guns to shoot people up. I got medical supplies to patch them up for round two. I've never heard of him. Because everyone he's worked with is dead. He's everywhere. If the devil had a name, it'd be Chuck Finley. Who is he, and what do you know about him? He did the same thing to a couple of guys I worked with out west. He used to run black ops for the government. Assassinations, man, stealing secrets. But now, he just steals from people like you and me. He takes what he wants, and he just leaves a trail of bodies. He's not stealing from anybody. We got the warehouse. You don't think he already knows about the warehouse? Are you kid... And if he doesn't, he'll figure it out one way or another. And not just this stuff. He's gonna take everything. He's gonna clean you out! In fact, yeah, he's probably already done that. He's gone. I'd like to go. Give me my money. I'll get on a plane, a train, anything. You're not going anywhere. You're gonna help us move the drugs. No, no, no. I am not going back to that warehouse. Are you crazy? You tell me. Hello, police? I'm on the corner of 29th and 1st ave. There are these men here with guns. I think they're drug dealers. You have patrols in the area already? Thank goodness. You need the police to respond right away, call ahead.</i> If you've reported a few minor crimes within a six-block radius,</i> you can be sure someone will show up when you need them.</i> - What's that? What are the boxes? - Antiviral drugs. Antiviral? I can't be responsible for that. Don't worry. You won't be. They're already sold. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. He's here. That's the guy. That's Finley. We got to go! - He's one guy. - One guy? You don't understand! He's not alone. He must have guys in that truck. - We got to get out of here! - You're not going anywhere. Just load the stuff. We'll take care of Finley and his guys. Most people think that shooting the gas tank</i> of a vehicle makes it explode. Unless the car's on fire, you'll just spill a few bucks' worth of gas.</i> An explosion requires something extra, like a few bags of acetone peroxide taped to the gas tank.</i> You don't know what this means for us. May I suggest that you fly the medicine next time? What can I do to repay you? You know some guys who can help move a fridge? My cooler doesn't hold much beer, Mike. Your daddy would have been so proud of you. Thank you. - Mike, I didn't call her. - I know. Michael told me what you were doing here in Miami, and it's a wonderful thing you did, Virgil. - I'm sorry about before. - It's okay. You can make it up to me over a dinner. Take her someplace nice. No guns. You got it. You know, Mike, if you had to have a stepdad, you could do worse. Seymour has our information? He didn't say. Just wanted us to stop by his place. He sounded more paranoid than normal. You missing a date for this? Oh, don't flatter yourself. Seymour promised to upgrade my laser-targeting assist. Said I could pick it up tonight. Should be quick. I have no intention of missing any more dates. You look beautiful, Fi. So, this guy, is he nice? Your date? Yeah, very. He's a paramedic. - I think you'd like him. - I wouldn't count on that. What'd you get me into? I was wondering the same thing. Who the hell are you? Why did you ask me about that sniper rifle? You'll start answering questions or your girlfriend gets - a bullet in the head. - I'm not his girlfriend. Anyone who played soccer knows there's a long nerve that runs down the shin.</i> Hit that nerve, and people lock up in pain.</i> Arms dealers keep gunpowder handy to manufacture customate rounds.</i> But gunpowder doesn't need to be in a bullet to be dangerous.</i> Even muzzle flare can set it off. So when dispersed through a room, anyone with half a brain puts his gun away.</i> No, no, no! Jackass, don't shoot! You'll blow us all up! Seymour, you want to tell me what that was about? Dude, look! I track down a shop that had done some work on the gun you're asking about. The place was burned to the ground, man. They killed the guy who owned it. All right? I thought you were setting me up for something. - Who brought the gun in, Seymour? - I don't know. No, I swear, I swear. All I know is some guy picked up some stuff for it, okay? Specialy calibrated muzzle brakes, night sights, and a fiber-optic camera. That's all I know. Who's the guy? What's his name? They said his name is Bill Johnson. OK? That's all I know, I swear. Please don't hurt me. Fi. We were never here, you understand? I got it. I never saw you. Sorry about the dress, Fi. I'm not. I got this baby. With amazing targeting assist. Johnson has something to do with people who burned you? I have to assume so. He's putting a fiber-optic camera on a sniper rifle. That's for proof of death.
