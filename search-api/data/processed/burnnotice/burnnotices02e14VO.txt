You're blacklisted.</i> When you're burned, you've got nothing.</i> No cash, no credit, no job history. You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.</i> - Where am I? - Miami. You do whatever work comes your way. You rely on anyone who's still talking to you.</i> - <i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.</i> - Should we shoot them? An old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI.</i> You know spies... A bunch of bitchy little girls. - <i>Family, too...</i> - Hey, is that your mom again? - <i>If you're desperate.</i> - Someone needs your help. Bottom line... Until you figure out who burned you,</i> you're not going anywhere. Bribery's a lot more difficult than it sounds.</i> There's no way to shop around, so you usually overpay for whatever information you're after.</i> There's no money-back guarantee if the information's bad,</i> and of course the only thing that you know for sure</i> is that you're handing your money to a thief and a liar.</i> I still can't believe you're giving this money to some sleazy bank manager. I went to a lot of trouble to find him. I don't have a lot of options here. Michael, he hid money for a man who tried to assassinate you. Which makes him a good person to know if I'm trying to find that assassin. You're going to this meeting unarmed. You have no information. It's a tactical risk. Fi, I was warned not to meet you the first time. Yeah. I almost blew off your hand with a block of C-4. And I made a friend. Maybe I'll make another one. Watch my back. Gustavo. You have the money? No small talk? How was the flight? Bad. All the way here, I wonder why I do this. You came here because I'm giving you a lot of money for a little information. I just want a name, a few numbers, and you're back on a plane. First, I need to know how you found me. Bank-secrecy regulations in the Cayman Islands are not easy to penetrate. I have friends. What friends? I don't even know who you are or why you want this information. When someone's asking for sensitive information,</i> it's basic security to make sure that the person you're dealing with</i> is who he says he is. An easy way is to change details that the other person would know.</i> We talked about this on the phone. I'm giving you $8,000 for a file. Part of what that money buys is privacy. I don't care what I said on the phone. You don't tell me what I want to know, you don't get this file. $8,000, no $8,000. The deal I made with Gustavo was for $10,000, not $8,000. He was very clear about that number. And we never talked on the phone. You want to tell me who you are? I can explain. Michael, what happened? He didn't want to make friends. Season 2, Episode 14: Truth and Reconciliation. Synchro VO: S@lomon www.subbers-in-black.com Hey, Mike. Look what I got for you, huh? My police buddy. It was his day off. We went out on his boat. Did you get anything besides the fish? I got a peek at a police file from the Caymans. Seems that the real Gustavo was found dead in a bar. I guess that's what you get if you run payroll for an assassin. - Where do you want me to put this? - Sink. - Did you catch it? - No, buddy of mine did, but I figured you could use the protein. Thanks. So there was nothing on my friend with the knives? No, except that he's as dead as that fish. Probably got smuggled in. Fi knows some people who make extra-special travel arrangements. I'm supposed to meet her at the Carlito for lunch. Bring the fish. Maybe they'll cook it for you. Mr. Westen? - That depends. - My name is Claude Laurent. I need help. I found someone who worked with you before. He said that you were a good man and once worked for the government? Yeah, I was a government worker. Please, please. - I can pay you. - What exactly do you need? Several years ago, my daughter, Veronique, was murdered in Haiti. I am here to bring the man who killed her to justice. I'm not sure what you've heard about me, but... a murder in Haiti, that's not... - No, I can't go there. - No, please. Here. See? Jean-Pierre Duman. He has a new name. I have this, too. It's from the inter-American court of human rights. We use it to make him come back to Haiti and stand trial. Duman was an official in Haiti. Veronique spoke out against him. He had her put in prison, and then he had her killed. Mr. Laurent, this is not gonna work in an American court. - Who is this man with the fish? - The man with the fish is right. You don't even have proof of Duman's identity. - No, no, no, I have found him, and... - Claude, listen to me. I'm sure Veronique would want you to go home and live out the rest of your life remembering... You know nothing... of my daughter. You do not deserve to speak her name. They said you were an honorable man. They lied. - What? - Nothing. Just waiting for Fi to show up. You know, Mike, back in the day, I had some buddies who worked in Haiti. Saw some of those prisons. Bad, Mike. Very bad. A lot of guys got away with a lot of bad stuff... Evil. Always wished I could do more. Sam, he's got a worthless letter. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Probably just a... big fat waste of time. Just forget all about it. A man and his daughter. You want me to check out Duman? Is that what you want me to do? I made some calls when I was taking a leak, and I found addresses of a couple places he hangs out. - Yeah, mom? - <i>Michael, I need you to come over.</i> - <i>There's been a break-in.</i> - All right. I'll be right there. So, this was the break-in, mom? I didn't even know you still owned this car. I park it at Mrs. Gartelman's. They took the tape deck, Michael! - What do you want me to do about it? - Well, not you. We. They're having break-ins all over here. There's a real crime spree, and I thought that the two of us could look into it together. Well, how about I get you a new stereo? It's not about the stereo. I got the descriptions of the boys who did it. So call the police. Yeah, right. They're not gonna do anything about this, and you know it. Could you at least give me a ride to the store? 'cause the... car won't start now. Because the tape deck is stolen? Hey, blame your father. He installed the radio. He wired the damn thing to the ignition. Spend enough time in international hot spots,</i> and you learn that a lot of the worst monsters on Earth</i> are just spoiled rich kids. Mass murderers come in many shapes and sizes,</i> but they tend to drink the same brands of champagne.</i> That's the guy. Jean-Pierre Duman. His dad was a regional governor. Damn near turned corruption into an art form, died a few years back. Jean-Pierre went into the family business? Yeah. Party boy there ran the local prison. Anybody complained, they went there. Lucky ones were just executed. After the election, the whole family disappeared with most of the island's GNP. Disappeared till now? Well, yeah, now he's Luc Renard. He chases skirts, throws parties at his place on Star Island. Mike, I'm telling you, we can do this. You mean prove he's Duman? Yeah, and you know how it is. Nobody throws out everything when they go off-grid. We just got to get into his place. Into his high-security place on Star Island. Nothing worth doing is easy, and nobody loves easy more than me, but it's true. Fiona, feel like coming to a party? People love the sound of their native tongue.</i> Even the most security-conscious person often lets his guard down</i> when he hears somebody who speaks his language.</i> If that somebody happens to be in a designer dress...</i> What, I can't go in? So much the better. I will see you both later? No. No, you won't. And what do you suppose I will be doing later? I'll think of something. I don't even know your name. Luc Renard. Claire Neville. Come. Party at my house. Is this yours? Yes. Do you like it? Does it belong to your family, or did you buy all this all by yourself? You know, I don't like to talk business. Come, let me show you the rest of the house. Where does this lead? This leads nowhere. Come this way. I have the biggest bathtub in Miami. Well, if it's so big, maybe we should invite a friend or two. Give me a minute. - Yeah, Fi? - I'm in his office. - There's not much here. - Well, then, get out. If Duman catches you, you're not getting out of there with a stern conversation. Well, it's a shame to waste the opportunity. I'm planting a bug. This is the house of Jean-Pierre Duman!</i> He murdered my daughter! Come out and show yourself, Jean-Pierre!</i> You cannot hide from your crime! Our Haitian friend just crashed the party, and it looks like Monsieur Duman is not too happy about his new guest. Go and take care of him. Now! Go! You have 30 seconds to get here before Duman kills another member of the Laurent family. - You're driving my car back. - No problem, Mike. Come out, Duman! Staying hidden isn't always about sticking to the shadows.</i> Get in the car now! In fact, if you're enemy's eyes are adjusted to the dark,</i> there's no better place to be than behind the brightest light you can find.</i> Why did you come? - Why did you change your mind? - Because that's the kind of guy he is. He's an honorable man, just like they told you. He's just a little slow sometimes. So... - Where do we go from here? - You go back to Haiti. I am not leaving. I am staying until it is done. We have more experience with this kind of thing. I can help. I found Duman when no one else could find him. Listen, Claude. You've done your part. Now let us do ours. We'll get the guy. How? How will you do that? By getting him to give us evidence proving who he is. Now, Mike is a very convincing guy. Trust me. You can count on him. But you need to go home. It's better for everyone. You understand? Yes. I understand. So, I asked around about who might have brought your... knife-wielding fake banker into the country. It was rough. I mean, the Miami gun smugglers and the Miami people smugglers, they don't get along. And I've always been more of a gun person. - You're sure not a people person. - You want to take over, Sam? Oh, wait. That's right. I forgot. All your friends wear uniforms, which makes you useless. Hey, who found out about this guy in the first place, huh? Sam, Fi, just keep looking. I intend to. Good news on the Haitian front. I got an angle on Duman. His family used to do business with Flintridge Industries. It's a big multinational that built all the prisons. FBI's been nosing around them for years. You still in touch with those FBI agents that were on the "Follow Michael Westen around Miami" beat? Well, I could make a call, but we didn't part on the best of terms. Well, I think it's time to mend some fences, Sam. If you've spent time working for the government,</i> you understand that it's a game with its own rules.</i> If you want to make the government work for you,</i> you have to understand how the game is played.</i> An FBI agent might hate you, but if working with you gets him out of an assignment he hates even more,</i> you've got yourself a partner. Hey, guys! What's going on, huh? She looks dangerous. Cute, Sam. You know you're interfering with a federal investigation? What is she, like 80? Did she steal somebody's dentures? It's a racketeering case. Biggest drug-smuggling family in South Florida. Is she the boss? Boss's grandmother. Oh, man. You should check the film speed in that camera. At the rate she's moving, you don't want to miss anything. - What do you want, Axe? - I come bearing gifts. I have a peace offering. A case that you guys can take back to your office and be proud of. You might even get a commendation from the higher-ups. This more crap like the stuff you gave us on Westen? I never lied to you guys about him. Well, sure, I forgot some stuff. What is it, Sam? We've got work to do here. He's an international fugitive hiding in Miami under a new identity, related to an investigation you guys are already doing. That's a whole different department, Sam. - Years in court. - Listen, guys, just check it out, all right? We've had our differences, but I know you FBI guys bust your ass every day to do the right thing. I'll give you a time and a place. Just check it out. Watch out for granny. You know, if you guys want me to take her out, let me know. All right. Good luck. Being a fugitive takes work. When you're being hunted,</i> hiding isn't something you can do effectively without help.</i> So the best way to catch a fugitive isn't to approach him as one of the people hunting him down.</i> It's to approach him as one of the people who can help him stay on the run.</i> Ladies, I'm terribly sorry, but I have a very important meeting with Mr. Duman. - Could you excuse us? - Who are you? Me? My name is Owen Matthews. But the more important question is, who are you? If you don't want to have a very public, very uncomfortable conversation on that topic right now, I'd ask these ladies to leave. What do you want? What makes you think you can just sit at my table? What gives you that right? You know, I don't like to have a meeting like this, but when I find Jean-Pierre Duman sitting in a restaurant with FBI agents outside, it is my obligation to sit down. I've got a job. The people I work for pay me a lot of money to make sure they don't land in federal prison. The people I work for are very concerned right now about the legal problems of Jean-Pierre Duman. I don't know what you're talking about. My name is Luc Renard. Luc Renard. Call yourself whatever you like. It doesn't matter what I think. It matters what they think because they're the ones following you. They're the ones who will be asking you questions. - This conversation is over. - Just give me a few more minutes. - You need to hear what I have to say. - Speak. The people I work for were at Flintridge Industries back when the company was working with the Duman family. I have been hired to sanitize the record of those years. - I am here to help you, Jean-Pierre. - My name is Luc Renard. No, it's not. Not yet. There is still a trail that exists, linking who you are with who you were. I am here to redirect that trail, Jean-Pierre. Until I do, everyone's in jeopardy. You, my clients, everyone. Let go... of my arm. I'm not the problem here. I'm the solution. Call me. - Hey, Maddie. - Hey, Sam! What are you doing here? Mike said your ignition need some work. I'm already taking care of it. I'm not helpless, Sam. - You ever had your car broken into? - No, mostly just broken. Well, I told the police I want a list of all the reported break-ins in this area over the last six months. Do you know these types of crimes tend to cluster? I read that. Very impressive. Don't pretend. This is gonna take time. I have a partner-stretching class in half an hour. Can you give me a ride? - Sure, yeah, I can get you over there. - Great! 'cause I need a partner too, all right? So you can hang out for the class and then give me a ride back. Partner stretching? That sounds painful. Boy. Geez. You all right? This body was not built for the hip-adductor stretch. What? I got an inflamed bursal sac. Got to ice it down. Look, Mike, I think it's best if you deal with your mom about the car. ... with the FBI. They know my real name.</i> - Is that the bug in Duman's office? - Yeah. What do I pay you for? To protect me, to keep your eyes on things.</i> We found the license plate of the car that was here at the gates,</i> - the man with the megaphone. - So, who was he?</i> His name is Claude Laurent. He's staying at the Golden Sunset motel down by the beach.</i> Maybe he talked to the FBI. Then why are we here? Take me. Now!</i> Mike, Claude didn't leave Miami. We got to get over there. Before Duman sends him home in a body bag. Well, looky there. Got our own little death squad right here in the U.S. of A. Hold on, Sam. Stay here. I'm pretty sure this is a two-man job, you know, once the shooting starts. I'm gonna see if I can keep the shooting from starting. Tell me you guys aren't this stupid. - What the hell are you doing here? - What do you think I'm doing here? I'm here because the guy in this motel is pretty pissed at the Duman family and causing problems for my clients. But let me ask you, Luc, what are you doing here? Last we spoke, you hadn't even heard of the Duman family. - Get out of my way. - You think that's gonna solve anything? No, this is gonna solve nothing. It is gonna cause us problems. It's gonna make it worse. Worse for me, worse for my clients, - worse for you. - Move! You kill that man, you validate everything he says. That means news attention, attention from the FBI. I cannot let that happen. You say you can change the past. How? Yes, I can change that. I can take everything that connects you back to Haiti, every document, every bank statement, all of it. I can clean it and hand you back a whole new you, a Jean-Pierre Duman who never has to hide again. Now choose. I can change your story... Or end it. Come to my house tomorrow. Your house? Is that Jean-Pierre Duman's house or Luc Renard's? We will see. No, wait, wait, wait, wait. You said you were going to leave town. No, you said it would be safer for me to go. I said I understood. And I do. You put yourself in danger. I... do not want safety, Mr. Westen. I want justice. We said we would handle this. Your daughter wants you to get yourself killed? That is what they said when I wanted to go to the prisons to find her. That is what they said when I wanted to go to the newspapers. I failed her before. I will not fail her again. - You were not responsible. - I was a coward! But never again. I will not leave until Jean-Pierre Duman is returned to Haiti to face what he has done. Working covert ops, you learn to exploit weakness.</i> You manipulate greed, fear, pride to make people do what you want. But when you're dealing with true believers,</i> those weaknesses aren't there. All you can do is help or get out of the way.</i> Wait. You won't be safe at your motel. I would like you to stay here. It seems my people skills are improving, Michael. You found the guy who smuggled in our fake banker from the Cayman Islands?</i> I found where he keeps his boat, and he just arrived. - <i>Go easy on him, Fi.</i> - You're breaking up. As a spy, it's usually best to be unknown.</i> It allows you to adjust to any situation and be whoever you need to be.</i> However, there are certain advantages to being known.</i> A reputation can be a powerful tool. - You leaving? - I was just... You just got here. I forgot something. I have to go get the thing that I forgot. - Look, I don't want any trouble. - But we haven't had a chance to meet. - Fiona. - Yeah, I know who you are. You shot up Paco's boat, you set fire to that guy's place up in Boca. Well, they interfered with one of my gun shipments. But you wouldn't do that. - We're friends. - What do you want? I need to know about a guy who came in a few days ago, called himself Gustavo. He liked to play with knives. He's dead, Gary. He fell off a parking garage. I brought him in on a run-up from the Caymans. He paid cash. That's it. You know, I got to tell you, I'm a little disappointed, Gary. I expect so much more from my friends. I brought him in. I dropped him off at a storage unit. I never saw him again. A storage unit. That's good. You wouldn't happen to have the address of that storage unit, would you, Gary? Ma! What, honey? Have you seen dad's power sander? What? I've been to your place, Michael. Your sander's better than your father's. What, are you checking on my progress? I've seen guided missiles with simpler circuitry. - Why don't you just let me... - I can do this. How's Sam? Recovering. Your stretching class nearly killed him. Well, what doesn't kill him will make him stronger. Believe me. I know. I don't think that applies to cigarettes, ma. You want to go to the police with me? They're gonna show me photos of every burglar in the area. No, I got to... Michael, what is so important that you couldn't do that with me? I'm helping a man find justice for his murdered daughter. Well, if you need any help with that, honey, you let me know. I think I found the storage facility where Gustavo kept his stuff. Not too much damage done, I hope? Oh, no. I didn't have to lift a finger. My reputation precedes me, apparently. You should think about moving into one of these storage units. Some have air-conditioning. It would be a step up. I'll keep it in mind. Call the storage unit and make some inquiries. Let them know Gustavo passed away and that you're coming by after-hours to check on the unit. I think I can handle that. And you... can say hello to Monsieur Duman for me. Most people have a hard time letting go of their past.</i> The same guy who will burn a village to the ground without a thought</i> often won't throw away an old necktie</i> because it reminds him of his high-school graduation.</i> If you know what you're doing, you can hang him with that necktie.</i> Come in. How does this work, what you do? You give me everything you have. Your passport, your medical records, your financial records, everything from the old days, everything that ties you to the name Jean-Pierre Duman. And then? We give you a new set of records. The money siphoned from the government turns into income</i> from overseas investments. You get a new travel record proving you weren't even in the country</i> when your enemies died in prison. I handle it all. My family left the island of Haiti in a hurry. These are some of the things we thought we might need. My father wanted to burn them, but I thought perhaps someday... You made the right choice. No man should ever have to hide forever. I'll take these and start cleaning. Wait. First... My father would like to speak to you. Your father? - I've read that your father was... - Was dead, yes? Back in Haiti, we buried another man in his place. Oh, no. Daddy's still alive. He's old-fashioned. He wants me to sit in the house and hide from the cameras, but I told him about you. He did not believe, but I said that you would explain. So... This is the man who can change the past. I called some people I know long ago at Flintridge Industries. They do not know you. Tell me. Why is this? Some big misunderstanding. Let's clear it up, though. Who did you talk to? Sam? Because Sam is who I talk to. Let me get him on the phone. You know Sam. He's got the big office with the big windows, south side of the building, the glass doors, you know, where you can walk right out onto the balcony. There is... no such man. Who are you? Papa... Wait, he said, he knew about the prisons, about Flintridge, about the money, he... How many times... I tell you to be careful? But he warned me that the FBI was investigating us. Tell him! It takes a lot longer to pull a gun than most people think it does.</i> Almost five seconds, on average, to draw and line up a shot.</i> Whether this is good or bad news depends on what side of the gun you're on.</i> Get him! Get him! The papers are gone. They know we're looking. - They'll have burned them by now. - So that's it? - Now we can do nothing? - I didn't say that. The papers were just a way to get him to Haiti. I assume there are people who can identify him there without papers? Yes, many people. It's time for Duman to take a trip back home. I like it. Fi, can you get Duman away from his bodyguards? Sam, can you get us a truck? For the chance to take these guys down, I'll get us a convoy. When you're abducting someone, transportation usually isn't the issue.</i> There is no trick to driving a truck with someone hidden in the back.</i> The challenge is getting them into the truck.</i> You can walk them in, drag them in, or let gravity do the work and drop them in.</i> Well, that should do it. I just hope it's not too comfortable. I'm sure it'll be fine. My guys in ties. We checked out Duman. Looks like the information you gave us is good for once, Axe. He's a real son of a bitch. Thing is, there's not a lot we can do, not without proof of who he is. - Damn shame, really. - Right. But the thing is, if you still want to help... Come on, Axe, you know as well as I do we can't do anything official unless we got warrants. - The thing's got to go up the chain. - Yeah, I figured. But, unofficially, what did you have in mind? Spend time with corrupt, homicidal third-world political figures,</i> and you hear a lot of self-pity. What kind of man throws his political enemies in prison</i> and tortures them to death? Usually it's a guy who feels so sorry for himself</i> he feels justified doing anything. Killers, by and large, are whiny losers,</i> but that doesn't make them any less dangerous.</i> I do not want to be disturbed. Understand? Lie down on your stomach. Close your eyes. Most over-the-counter allergy medicines contain mild sedatives.</i> In the right dosage, they cause a pleasant drowsiness.</i> In the wrong dosage, they cause dizziness, hallucinations, and unconsciousness.</i> What was that? My secret. Mr. Duman? Mr. Duman! Mr. Duman, open the door! Mr. Duman, are you okay? Mr. Duman, open the door! Calm down. Keep screaming all the way to Haiti, you're gonna be hoarse for your trial. I guess he can't change the past after all. You need to get going. Sam has a friend with a boat. He'll get you both back to Haiti. You'll go now? My daughter, she would have liked you. She was very brave. Like her father. What are those for? Well, I thought I'd... help you with the rewiring of the car, if you needed it. I did it! Really? You rewired the car by yourself? I did it. I went through some of your father's old papers. I found this diagram, and I just put the wires back where they were supposed to be. It wasn't that hard, Michael. I don't know what to say. They caught them! Teenagers breaking into garages. I watched them come out of Mrs. Hale's house. I recognized the photographs, and I called the cops. You know why I think your father wired the car the way he did? 'cause he thought if he was the only one who could fix it, we'd always need him. He'd be more useful, you know, part of the family. So, did you catch yours? The guy who killed the girl? Yeah, I did. Good for you, sweetheart. Hey, Sam, your buddy's boat make it back to Haiti okay? Yeah, the coast guard kept clear, thanks to you guys. We have no idea what you're talking about, Axe. Yeah, right. Well, I got a list of officials who took kickbacks from Flintridge Industries back in the day. It's probably enough for you guys to go after Papa Duman, too. - A little bird told me. - Little bird, huh? He thought it would keep him from being returned to the nest, and I figured this could buy some time away from granny. Not exactly by the book, Axe. Or I could send you a bouquet with a nice card. We'll find a way to use this. Man, all this talking makes me hungry, but mostly thirsty. Drinks on uncle Sam. Come on, guys. Cough it up. Mojito! - You call the storage place? - The manager knows we're coming. For the record, Michael, I don't like this plan. What plan? You using yourself as bait to see if whoever sent Gustavo after you takes another crack. That's what I would do. You're gonna let me back you up for real this time? If you're right, there's a good chance he's waiting on a roof with a rifle to take a shot at you. That's what I would do. I need him alive. I need you alive. You see anything, Fi? Not yet. Maybe it's time we announced our arrival. If you suspect you're walking into an ambush,</i> searching for where the bad guys are hidden</i> is probably going to get you killed. Unless you get lucky and find them in the first place you look, you're dead.</i> If you can manage it, the best move is to make it impossible to hide.</i> He's right above you. He's on the move, Michael. When you're in a foot chase, the trick is to stay in visual contact</i> with whoever you're pursuing until they run out of gas.</i> Of course, visual contact doesn't do you much good</i> if you're separated by a 12-foot-high, razor-wire-topped fence.</i> You should change your workout, Michael! You're not doing enough cardio.
