[ cellphone rings ] Man: we got a burn notice on you. you're blacklisted. when you're burned, you've got nothing --</i> no cash, no credit, no job history.</i> you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.</i> Where am i? miami. you do whatever work comes your way.</i> you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.</i> a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...</i> Should we shoot them? ...an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi...</i> You know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls. ...family, too... hey, is that your mom again?</i> ...if you're desperate. someone needs your help, michael.</i> bottom line -- as long as you're burned,</i> you're not going anywhere. [ knock on door ] Man: open up! police! whether you're dealing with the presidential guard in belarus,</i> the federal security service in russia,</i> or the local police in miami, the drill is pretty much the same --</i> keep your place clean of damning evidence.</i> keep your alibis and your whereabouts straight,</i> and always be ready for surprise visits.</i> Nate. what are you doing here? Just giving you a little taste of what i woke up to this morning, bro. I was dragged out of bed By someone very interested in you. Mr. westen. you mind if i come in? By all means. You know, if these visits become a habit, I'm gonna start thinking you like me. Oh, you remember my partner, detective lopez. I'm not sure you two formally met. I'm glad you're here. I got a gift for you. my daily activity log. Hmm. We were just dropping nate off. Just a way to say thank you For chatting to us about his big brother. And i thought it wouldn't hurt to see if you were free today To answer some questions. I'm crazy busy. I need to finish my yogurt. Then i was planning on working out. Well, until your calendar clears up, Just know i'm gonna make my way Through every friend, relative, and associate you have. Let me save you some time. My friends and family don't know anything. Sooner or later, someone will. When you want this to stop. How long you been in town? About six hours, Five of which were spent Listening to your girlfriend over there tell me That i'd fled to vegas To avoid some unpaid parking tickets. She was just trying to soften you up, Trying to get you to flip on me. Yeah. I figured that out after she said It would go easier if i flipped on my brother. Jesus, bro, i didn't say anything, all right? But do you know how hard it is Not to talk about your extracurricular activities? [ sighs ] All right. drive me to mom's. My car is there. i need to get to my meeting. Meeting? Limos, bro. I came back to talk with investors About expanding my company. This is real. okay? Things are finally breaking my way. Help me out? So, nate didn't give her anything? If there's one thing nate westen knows how to do, It's avoid telling the truth. Well, that's good news for now. But how long before paxson finds someone you know That she can flip, like a gun runner named seymour? Or a money launderer named barry? Or a washed-up navy seal named sam? Or how about an unstable, jealous -- Guys. If paxson's going after everyone i know, Then i need to get to know someone she'll regret going after. Not a bad idea. make it look like You're mixed up with someone with a little bit of clout, Maybe somebody from the mayor's office. I'm thinking a financial relationship, Something that looks very suspicious, But isn't actually illegal. Sounds fun. Thanks, sam. the lone spy who always works solo is a myth.</i> the truth is, you don't last long</i> without keeping a few friends around,</i> because your enemies will find you on their own.</i> You wouldn't happen to know where i could find a burned spy, Would you? Brennen. That's my way of saying thank you For the last time i saw you. Well, nice to see you, too. Although i thought you'd still be running From those angry south americans. You know, i would be, But it seems that a rival cartel got an anonymous shipment Of ak-47s and rocket launchers, So those angry south americans were a little busy, What with all the killing and dying. You financed a private war so you could get back to miami? Why? An exciting business opportunity. A limo company. Actually, i think you might know the owner. Nate. You're nate's investor. But not just me. i have a partner. Nate's with him now. Doesn't nate look happy? closing his little deal. Of course, he doesn't realize that his investor Is actually an enforcer from sicily called "the butcher." Brought him over special just for this. Brennen, if you -- Oh, oh, oh, michael, no. it's not up to me. Whether nate's meeting ends in a bullet or a handshake Is entirely up to you. See, you're gonna be running some errands for me today. Just think of me as, uh... your new boss. Cellphone, keys, wallet, and your sunglasses. I want to see those pretty eyes. Let's go. You're certainly in a hurry. Is this little job of yours time-sensitive? Listen to you. Probing for intel from the get-go. You are a sly one, aren't you? You know, you could save me some time. You could tell me what we're doing. Hmm. uh, pass. You're just a key, michael. Keys don't need to know what's behind the doors they unlock. Now, rules for the superspy. i give orders, you obey. You try to escape, nate dies. Fail to complete a task, nate dies. Refuse an order -- I get it. But i'm not playing fetch until i know nate's okay. Michael, we covered this. the picture? No, that could have been taken hours ago. Prove nate's alive now, or your project ends here. Well, how about this? you stop making demands, or your life ends here.</i> your first priority when you're captured</i> is to make it clear that your cooperation isn't free.</i> your captor gets what he wants if you get what you want.</i> Get in the car. You're the one stopping me. Prove to me i'm not wasting my time. in any healthy relationship, there needs to be some give and take.</i> One word... And nate dies. Not right away, of course. My partner is a man who really enjoys his work. [ cellphone rings ] Yeah, it's me. Put our friend on. It's for you. This is nate. Nate westen, simon davis. Simon, my man. hey, you heading over? Uh, i've got a few errands to run, But you can work out the broad strokes with my partner. Be careful, though, buddy, He can be ruthless once he starts to work you over. Yeah, no, i'm looking forward to the challenge. Good, buddy. i'll see you soon. All right. Happy? now, get in the damn car. So, this is the house where the michael westen grew up, huh?</i> And now you're living here. with his mom? I'm just crashing here for a while, okay? I'm just helping out with some home repairs. It's not like that. You got here fast, barry. oh, yeah, yeah. My salon's in the neighborhood, so... Anyway, so michael's got a cop problem? Yeah, it's making life unpleasant for all of us. We need a little help to make it go away. Okay. well, tiny issue, all right? My life coach has strongly suggested That i try and avoid stressful situations. Barry, we're not asking you to storm the station. Just open a joint bank account with mike... And a mayor's aide. [ sighs ] Great. Why don't we just throw a judge in there while we're at it? Barry, we called you Because this cop isn't just our problem. She's interrogating everybody in mike's life. You really want to find out what questions she has For his dear old money-laundering pal barry? Here's what you're gonna do. Go here and tell fabian That i'm giving you the portable skimmer. Fabian? I hired an intern. Once your pretty little hands swipe that card... ...my pretty little hands are gonna do some financial magic. Yeah, uh, say, barry, Before you and your hands get too busy, I thought maybe you could help me out With a little home-improvement project. So who's the guy with the purse? That's barry. What does he do? He's sam's financial consultant. Now you got to hold it up. hold it in position. I got to put this thing up. hold that down. We're here. where's "here"? You see that building? There's a hardware key in a desk in office 237. In about a half an hour, it's gonna be in my pocket. This gets you past security. Besides the guards, There should be nobody in the building on a sunday. I hope you know more about the building Than my jacket size. Superspy, you got bigger things to worry about Than how pretty you look in your coat. The offices are wired to the building's alarms. You ready? How long do i have inside? If you're not going to tell me what we're doing here -- Westen, just eat what's on your plate. One more thing. While you're in there, phone a friend, write an e-mail, Update your facebook status -- i honestly don't care. As long as you remember what really matters here -- I don't get what i want, and your brother dies. Now, run along. [ scanner beeps ] spies are trained to use whatever resources are available.</i> in the hills of afghanistan, the best you can hope for are rocks and some scrub brush.</i> in an office building, you may have more options.</i> technology that makes communication easier...</i> also tends to make it more vulnerable.</i> the bluetooth on a cellphone, for example,</i> is an easy way to send information wirelessly</i> over short distances. use an antenna, and you can get that same information</i> over longer distances. if you don't have an antenna, you can build your own.</i> a combination of metal washers and a bent coat hanger</i> connected to a cylindrical chip scan</i> will allow you to capture the signal.</i> a usb cable transmits the stolen information to a computer.</i> add a few pencils for legs, and you've got a cute little improvised hacking device.</i> What? Hey, watch that window. If anything goes wrong, i'm gonna knock it out And throw the hardware key down to you. Fine. just hurry up, westen. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Madeline: what was that?! Oh, nothing, just part of the process. Barry, you're gonna have to start bringing the second man To this two-man job. Sam! what, did you break it? No, no, no, it's fine. very sturdy wood and, uh, glass. [ cellphone rings ] Yeah? sam. Mike? Yeah, i don't have a lot of time. Remember brennen? Yeah, the arms dealer. liked to strap bombs to kids. Yeah, he's back, And he's threatening to kill nate Unless i steal something for him, Some kind of high-tech equipment. Uh, hey, why don't you show maddie our progress, And i'll be right back? Are you okay? is nate okay? Yeah, i'm fine. nate was 35 minutes ago. That's all i know. What can i do? I just hacked brennen's cell. i e-mailed you everything on it. I need you to comb through the addresses, Text messages, and phone calls. You want to know what brennen's after? I want to know everything. I want to know who his buyer is, where he's got nate, What brand of orange juice he drinks in the morning. I'm on it. And you better hurry, 'cause i get the feeling Brennen's got the westen brothers fitted for body bags. [ click ] [ alarm blaring ] nothing sells innocence like an injury.</i> people naturally sympathize with someone who's bleeding.</i> if you're in a situation where you really need the benefit of the doubt,</i> it's worth a flesh wound. [ alarm continues ] What the hell did you do? [ slurring ] oh, i -- I-i was moving the rack, and it fell into the window. It just tipped over. yeah, i was -- The squeegee blade fell, and i went to get it, And i hit it, and it fell. Are you trying to pull something? No. Come on, man, i -- the blade came off, and it fell. [ radio beeps ] rick, kill the alarm. [ alarm blaring ] Did you go into that office? No, i only do the hallways, so i -- [ alarm stops ] ow! ohh! What the hell is this? I was picking up glass, and i cut myself. Okay, what's your name? Johnny. john dickson. And i do the windows. And i'm gonna get a vacuum and i'm gonna clean this up. Johnny, no, hey, hey, hey -- you're gonna stay right here. Whenever there's an alarm, we have to call the police. It's building procedure. You don't have to do that. No, listen, you don't have to do that! It's simple glass! it fell! Are you drunk? No. Don't lie to me. i can smell it on you. No, no, wait. just hold on, please? This job is all i got, And if i miss a child-support payment, My ex is gonna take the kids to flagstaff with her boyfriend. So, i messed up. And i am sorry. But i'll make it right if you just let this one slide. Look, you call somebody to pick you up. Thank you. Thank you. So? What's next? [ tires screech ] in the adrenaline rush of a high-stress situation,</i> you tend to miss details. but it's the little things that make all the difference.</i> You keep looking at me that way, You're gonna have to buy me dinner. Sig 226. That's an impressive piece of hardware. Yeah. it is. what's that tell you about me? That i feel the need to appear powerful and intimidating? I see you're still a sharp dresser. Is that brioni? Come on. Now, what is that gonna tell you about me? It's already pretty well established that i like nice things. And pretty things. Who gave you the tie pin -- your wife? Married? please. And enough with the digging. you're boring me. Okay. Here's how this is gonna work. The guy in that house has a voice. You have a voice recorder. You're gonna put the two together. You want to be a little more specific? Do you want his favorite bible verses, freestyle rap? Full name and every number, zero through nine. Someone's making a voice key. Ding, ding, michael westen. His name's jonathan carver, A man with the right clearance at the right company, And the only employee Who doesn't have a family, a dog, or an adt account. Thanks for making it easy on me. Actually, i understand he's a bit of a gun nut, Which means he's less likely to call the cops And more likely to just shoot you. So good luck with that. Do you have a car-repair kit? a tire iron is great if you need a new tire.</i> it's also great if you need a new car,</i> because a tire iron can be used to break a window...</i> ...and pry open the steering column</i> to expose the ignition leads. it's the ultimate all-purpose tool.</i> [ engine turns over ] [ tires screech ] Oh, man, i am so sorry. This cat ran right in front of me. Yeah, well, the cat cost you 2 grand. At least. look at this damage. Oh, man. I left my wallet in my jacket at home, And the insurance card is in my wallet. Are you trying to get out of this? No, no, no, man. I'll just call my insurance company, And they'll totally have all of my -- my info -- And i left my cellphone in my jacket. Can i use -- you can use mine. That's great, thanks. Do you have pen and paper? Phone's in there. [ whistles ] You sure do buy a lot of guns, mr... i don't buy guns. i make them.</i> What's this one here, a .357? You make this one? It's a .45, and no. Oh. what about this little tiny one? It's a ruger. Yeah, but what kind of bullets does it use? I thought you wanted to use the phone. Yeah. well, you're an engineer of guns? Where'd you go -- m.i.t.? State. I was at the u of m. i graduated 1.9 gpa. What'd you have, like a 4.0? 3 something. 3.1, 3.2, 3.3? 3.9. what does it matter? Hey, do you want me to get the phone for you? no, no. Let me get your name first, and then before i call them... Jonathan carver. What's that, mr. carpenter? It's carver, and it's three-oh-five... Three zero five? Yes. three-oh-five. You mean three-zero-five? Yes, three-zero-five! Will you stop interrupting me? Sure. thanks. Okay, so what's that? That is an international transfer charge. [ cellphone rings ] that means that brennen's moved money -- Wait. Mike? yeah, it's me. What's brennen got you doing? I just finished stealing a hardware key With an agency routing code. Okay. And now? And now i'm hanging out With a gun designer named jonathan carver, Collecting numbers for a voice key. Sounds like brennen's after some government-funded weapon. How are we doing on the information from brennen's phone? Well, could be better. I mean, it's less than a week old. I mean, this weasel's pretty careful. Deletes his text messages. There's no contacts list, either. What about his call log? Call log. So, there, i think we got a little bit of good news. Brennen placed a bunch of calls To hamstead bank and trust. He used his phone to enter his pin. So barry got into his account? Yeah. Brennen's moving a lot of money, mostly to other banks, Some numbered accounts, and a company... Onyx international. Barry's working on it. Look for any rent or mortgage payments. If brennen's got a place in miami, There's a good bet nate's there. What are you trying to pull? That sure as hell ain't your insurance company. [ beep ] Mike? one of the great things about stealing information</i> is that nobody knows it's gone. steal someone's purse, and you're probably in for a lot of screaming.</i> but steal someone's credit-card number,</i> and half the time, they thank you.</i> How was your meal? Let me take this for you. [ scanner beeps ] I'm sorry. I know you're not our waitress, but my friend's in a hurry. Can i give it to you? [ cellphone rings ] Fi, where you been? Skimming. I got the debit card info from -- Okay, i need you to meet me right now. What? why? We got a situation. Mike's in trouble. How soon can you meet me at 115 island? I'll be there in 10. [ horn honks ] [ tires screeching ] Look, i don't know who you are. I don't know what you think you're doing. But you're done lying to me. involving civilians in operations is dangerous,</i> but sometimes necessary. I want 2 grand in cash, And your car stays right here until i get it. Hang on! no! when it has to happen, you do what you can to keep the civilian out of harm's way.</i> You know, this is your fault just as much as it is mine. that said, you try a little harder with some civilians than others.</i> Look at your car! That car is eight inches from the curb, And it's supposed to only be six inches from the curb! What are you talking about? six inches?! Look at your car! it's in the middle of the street! look at it! and you're getting in my face?!</i> It is supposed to only be six inches from the curb! Say it's eight inches from the curb! say it! Get off me, man! i will! I'm gonna get off of you when you admit it! Just admit it. your car is eight inches from the curb. Say it. I'll let you go if you say it. Your car is eight inches from the curb. say it! All right, all right, all right! it's eight inches, all right? what? It's eight inches from the curb, you crazy son of a bitch! thank you. it's eight inches from the curb, you crazy son of a bitch!</i> Quite a performance. How we do? Great, but we need to go. Now. [tires screeching ] Michael: jla industries? You're forcing me to break into a weapons manufacturer. "forcing." such an ugly word. Encouraging? incentivizing? No, you're right, let's go with forcing. [ chuckles ] Anyway, there's a box in r&d lab 422. Gray, about yea big. Go fetch. What's in the box? for our purposes, it couldn't matter less. If you want me to go in there, it couldn't matter more. Anything could be in that box. I'm not handing over a nuke to save one life, Even if it is my brother's. Look, you want me to fetch, You'll tell me what's in the box and where it's headed. I'm pretty sure i can get you to go get it Without telling you a damn thing. [ cellphone rings ] Yeah, what's up? put him on. Hey, mr. davis. how's it going? Hey, hey, nate. good, good. Listen, i had a question for you. Are you one of those people who agrees to see a job through And then reneges? no, of course not. Is there a problem? No, no. It's just i hate working with people like that. It makes me crazy. It's just one of those things, you know? It makes me want to kill someone. Mr. davis, trust me, i wouldn't waste your time. Or mine. Good, good. Because i take my agreements very seriously, And i like working with people who do the same. Life is too short. Yeah. [ pointedly ] life is too short. [ chuckles ] Could you put my partner on? Mm-hmm. Yeah. so, what do you want me to do? Stay on the line. We're deciding whether little brother lives through the phone call. Mr. westen? I love my brother, brennen. But there's only one thing that gets me into that building. the problem with blackmail is that it's like a gun with only one bullet.</i> you can't waste that bullet on every little problem.</i> and the closer you get to your goal,</i> the harder it is to pull the trigger.</i> Keep him busy. i'll call you later. Right. Don't flatter yourself, westen. It's not a nuke. It's a biometric lock for advanced infantry weapons. People will go on killing each other in little wars All around the globe whether or not you steal it. The only difference is How much money i make while they do it. Fine. I do this, nate is released unhurt, And i never see you again. Done. An hour from now, I'm just a guy who sends you mean-spirited christmas cards. Okay. what am i looking at in there? A two-man security team. Unfortunately, you can't go around them. You've got to go through them. Looks like i'm gonna need that tire iron again. I like where your head is at, westen. if you had to choose an ideal environment for guerilla war,</i> it would probably look a lot like an urban parking structure.</i> [ car alarm activates ] it's an easy place to create a distraction</i> and draw out opposing forces. Check that out. a parking garage is also a great place</i> to control visibility and give yourself an advantage.</i> and once you do that, you can find cover and stage an effective ambush.</i> Don't struggle. don't struggle. I don't want to hurt you. Hello? Man: security. can i help you? Yeah, i work on the third floor, And i'm trying to get to my car in the garage, But the power is out. One of the guards went into the electrical room, But it's been a while, and it's still dark down here. I'll be right there. Thank you. Yeah, just got here. 362 burton drive. Uh-huh. well, fingers crossed. Nate better be here. Barry has run out of addresses to check. Second story, back door. that's our way in. [ cocks ] [ cocks ] Charlie? You in here? Charlie, you in -- aah! yeah, that move only works before you're in a choke hold.</i> Just relax. just relax. Go to sleep. night-night. Ladies first. Someone's been shopping. [ indistinct talking in distance ] [ indistinct talking continues ] [ indistinct talking stops ] Nate was here, fi. We probably just missed him. this beer is still cold. [ cellphone rings ] Yeah, mike? Sam, where are you? We're at brennen's. Did you find nate? Bad news, mike. Nate was here, but he's gone now. We're out of time, sam. Look, this is not over. I'll call barry again. We'll check for any addresses we might have missed. We're gonna find him. nate! Don't bother, sam. i just did. Doing deals over the phone is so impersonal. Seriously, it's not a problem. You know, i feel the same way. If we're gonna be business partners, We got to get to know each other. You know what i mean? we got to be, um -- Like brothers? is that what you were thinking? [ laughs ] What's he doing here? You know, nate, I'll bet michael's thinking the same thing about you. What? You see, it's always at the end, When everything's coming together, That people start making desperate moves. Nate, you're here to discourage stupid decisions And to show that i don't make idle threats. Aah! Nate! you're good right there. My arm. Stay still. stay still. calm down. I used one of those nifty frangible rounds. A lot of soft-tissue damage, but it doesn't usually kill. You didn't need to do that. Actually, i did. it's called a countermove. You just had to know what was in the box, So i just had to show you who was in charge. Now, assuming you can read a map, Just follow that red line right to my new beach house. Hardware key gets you into the r&d area. Carver's voice recognition gets you into the lab. I cut it together while you were playing with the guards. He needs to get to a hospital. you nicked an artery. His needs will be met just as soon as mine are. I promise. [ breathing heavily ] Oh, and, westen, don't dawdle. Otherwise, i'm switching to lead. [ beeps, lock disengages ] [ voice recorder beeps ] carver: jonathan carver.</i> [ erratic ] seven-one-three-four-eight.</i> [ beeps, lock disengages ] [ sighs ] [ cellphone dialing, rings ] [ beeps ] mike, what happened? Brennen brought nate here and shot him. Shot him?! Jesus, is he... No, he's hurt bad. It was just brennen's version of a pep talk. Sam, if we don't find something to use against brennen, I'm gonna have to give him what he wants. You give brennen what he wants, Chances are he'll kill you both. I'm running out of options, sam. Is there anything that we missed? Nothing good. You know, most of brennen's bank records Point to some north african buyer, So, you know, unless you're planning a trip to cairo... What else? A few llcs, haven't been touched in years. This onyx international, Some "s" corp, looks like a tax shelter. Tell me about onyx international. Well, it's more like a russian nesting doll than a company. You know, i dug through nine subsidiaries In six countries. All i got was "belle anna holding" out of zurich. He sends 40k every 6 months, it looks like. A lot of work to hide 80 grand a year. Yeah, no kidding. There's no business records, either, for belle anna. Mike, that's it. that's all there is. Mike, you still there? He had a tie clip. Looked like a gift. Didn't want to talk about his family. Belle anna holding? i think i might know what it is. You think or you know? Somewhere in between. does fi have any c-4? Well, it's fi, mike. you got to ask? Can you walk barry through intercepting a call in 10 minutes? That's gonna be tight, but, yeah, sure. Sounds like you've got something good, mike. [ cellphone beeps ] This is just outside of my comfort zone, okay? I'm just saying, i'm not that great with british dialects! There's no other way, barry. mike's counting on you. Ugh. i -- Just breathe, barry. It'll all be fine. Yeah, yeah, okay. How big do we want this? Well, enough to make a point. But not kill the neighbors. Really? Should be good, then. Tell me this is a joke. Was i unclear about the situation here? No, you were very clear. I had the box in my hands, then i decided you never will. Ever. [ remote beeps ] Jesus, fi! I told you not to kill the neighbors! You told me to make a point. take your picture. Ugh. [ cellphone beeps ] we should go. Get it now. Oh, god, please don't. I-i'm through playing games, westen. [ cellphone beeps ] I think you got a text message. It can wait. No, it can't. What the hell is this? It's your house, i believe. You did this? You found my place in miami and blew it up? Okay. If that's all you've got... Oh, that's not all. Since we last met, i became an expert on tyler brennen. I know everything about you, from where you get your teeth cleaned To where you do your banking. did your banking. i drained the accounts.</i> [ laughs ] Wow. that is a desperate bluff. "a" for effort, but -- I probably wouldn't believe me, either. Hamstead bank and trust has some fine security. But if you want to make a quick phone call, Put your mind at ease, i'll wait. [ cellphone beeps, rings ] [ exhales deeply ] [ british accent ] hamstead. Are you currently banking with us? Yes, i need to check my balance. Account number 06101966, Pin 1208. 1208. One moment. Mr. brennen. Are you calling about this morning's transfer? Transfer? Yes, at 11:00 a.m. local time, £261,000 was transferred out of this account. Your current balance is £4. if you like -- No. you're not this good. nobody is this good.</i> Yes, i am. I am so good, in fact, That i can put it all back, right now, if you let us go. You know what? i don't care. Just stuff. Burn it all down. i can start over. But you and your brother are finished. What about belle anna? I mean, annabelle? Annabelle? Annabelle. Your daughter. The one who gave you that nifty tie pin, The one you're sending to private school in switzerland For $40,000 a semester. you son of a bitch. [ cellphone dialing ] [ ringing ] Annabelle: hello? Sweetie, it's daddy. are -- are you okay? Daddy? yeah. why are you calling so late? Honey, i-i'm sorry. I forgot, uh... i forgot what time it was. You -- you go back to sleep, okay, pumpkin? I'll call you tomorrow. This isn't you, westen. You're capable of a lot, but you wouldn't hurt a child. But you would, brennen. this is your game. we're playing by your rules. Why go through all this? why not just -- Took some time to get an assassin into place Halfway around the world. You're lying. You want to find out? shoot me. If you go near her, if you touch her, if -- If she so much as skins her knee on the playground, I swear to god, westen, I will spend the rest of my life destroying you... ...and everything you love. Of course you will, brennen. She's your family. [ vehicle door opens ] You'll hear from me again, michael. Yeah, you owe me a christmas card. [ engines turns over ] [ groans ] [ tires screeching ] Hey, nate. How's the arm? Um, it's okay. it's a little bit sore. What'd you tell mom? I told her i was attacked by a mugger. I didn't want her to get scared. You thinking about sticking around for a while? I don't know. Feels a little weird being back now. You know, i thought i was here to land this big deal, and...
