you. You're blacklisted. When you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history. You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in. - Where am I? - Miami. You do whatever work comes your way. You rely on anyone who's still talking to you. A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... should we shoot them? An old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi... you know spies --a bunch of bitchy little girls. Family, too... hey, is that your mom again? If you're desperate. Someone needs your help,michael. Bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere. Prev iously on "burn notice"... the people who burned me got aspecialized rifle for a sniper, got him an access cardfor this building, and sent him to the conferenceroom on the fourth floor. Yeah, but we don't knowwhat he was doing in there. He's scouting a perch, sam. I thinkI found his target. If you want to get in her room,now would be the time. Find anything? We hit the jackpot. Well, there's somefamiliar faces in here. I thinkwe're getting close, mikey. There arethings in the works that are far, farover your head. Stay out of themor there will be consequences. There are cops here, and they'rearresting your brother! It's as setup. She's gonna have her snipertake his target out now. If I can get homeand get that access card, I can get to the sniperbefore he takes his shot. Yeah, I gotsome news, mikey. The sniper's dead. Someone booby-trappedhis front door, mike. When you're a spy, you learn to live with the idea of people wanting you dead -- an old enemy, a dissatisfied employer, a disgruntled asset. Work long enough, and the line to kill you gets pretty long. Still, getting blown up isn't really something you get used to. - What? - Don't try it. Don't try that. You just tooka pretty bad fall. Uh, make thata very bad fall. Come here, buddy. Easy. I think your carsaved your life, mike. Not the first time. You've been outfor about 20 minutes. I got hereas soon as I could. Watch your head. Either someone'svery interested in waterfrontstorage containers or they're hereto pay you a visit. Get yourseat belt on, mikey. Sam... Brace yourself, mikey. Oh, mike, steady. You okay? I'm fine. Sam, I'm sorryabout the car. Yeah. It's just I --I put a lot of love into it. Well, it'spretty identifiable now. Yeah, I know. I justneed a sec to grieve here. All right, look. You thinkwe should be out here? - I mean, maybe we shouldget you to a hospital. - We got to keep moving. When you're being hunted, paranoia is inevitable. If you don't know what to do with it, it turns into cold, directionless fear. With the right training, it turns into hyper-awareness of your surroundings -- not always pleasant, but a lot more useful. You seem a little unsteady. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. So, mike, who do you thinkwas in those cars? Probably carla's guys. Whatever's going on, my guess isshe needs to talk to me. She had nate arrested. What? Are you serious? I got a call from my momright before I talked to you. Hold on. Distinguishing between different kinds of suspicious behavior is crucial for an operative. Surveillance? Not surveillance,sam. Someone doing surveillance, for example, looks different... than someone who's trying to commit suicide. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly presents</font> -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> Burn Notice Season02 Episode10</font> let's just start with your name. What's your name? - It's kenny. - Kenny. You want to tell me why you were trying to kill yourself? It's my son, jack, okay? He needs the money. I was just trying to... j-just forget it, okay? Uh, mike, we should keep moving. I don't know how much longer... in a sec. Listen, I really need to go. Are you gonna be all right? You're not gonna be okay. What's up with him? He's just looking for some friends of mine. Who are you? I still don't understand. I'm someone who might be able to help you with your problem. You know, you look like you're in pretty bad shape yourself. Just tell me about your son, jack. He's 6, and he's got a heart problem since he was born. And it's getting worse. He, uh, might not make it. And how does getting hit by a bus help that? There's a treatment center in arizona that looks like it might be able to help him, but I can't afford it. A few months ago, I, uh... I blew all my money on a scam. A scam? Yeah. I met a lady in a pharmacy, and she told me her kid had the same thing, and he got cured. 250 grand later, it looked like it was working until the "doctor" vanished, and it turned out to be pep pills mixed with a painkiller. It just made jack worse. So I... I left a note for the babysitter, and I... I went out to get the money. From the first day of training, you're told not to get emotionally involved in operations. But sometimes it happens, and there's nothing you can do. JACK Give me whatever you have that's connected to the people that did this. I will get you your money back. Get my money back? Seriously? How? By any means necessary. HENNY***** - This is insane. - It's done, sam. It's irresponsible. You're raising this guy's hopes -- not to mention you were almost killed. You gotsurveillance everywhere. Your brother's in jail. You got plenty going on. And some guywalks in front of a bus and -- I didn't make himwalk in front of the bus, sam. You were looking for this. I know you. If it wasn't this guy, it'd be somebody elsewalking down the street. I'm running on fumes,sam. This is all I got. I can help this guy. All right, mike. I get it. Oh, look. There's our surveillance car,just like I said. Come on. Mike, let's go! I'm not running. Oh, no. Oh, you're not gonna... Oh, you are gonna. You hereto bring me in? Let me helP. You got tounlock the door. It's on the handle. Push, push. There you go, jackass. - Michael. - Carla. New office. I like it. What the hell was that today? You're asking me? Last time I checked,you put my brother in jail, you chased mehalfway across miami, and you nearly gotmy head blown off. We had nothingto do with that! Nothing? Your sniper gotblown up the same way. By the way,how'd the assassination go? An operationwas compromised. Which is why you're holed up in an office with two guysand a bag of cheetos. Tell me --why am i here? You were toldto stay out of our business! Well, clearly, youidn't thinkI would do what I was told, because you went toa lot of trouble keep me busy! We need to knowwhat happened.If you're playingsome kind of a game -- I am flatteredthat you think I'm that devious, but I didn't blow myself up for your benefit. I wantmy brother out of jail! I want answers! I want... my life back. We'll be in touch. Get him out of here. Whatever blew you upwas pretty substantial. If you'd haveopened the door any wider, we'd be picking uplittle itty-bitty pieces of you. Can you checkthe chemical traces, see what kind of explosives they used? Sure. Michael, I do admire yougetting right back to work, but you didalmost die yesterday. You want to call the guy? Say, "sorry about your kid, but I got a lotgoing on right now"? Find anythingin the medical records, sam? Well, I cross-checked the clinics andthe pharmacy records, and it looks likeour scammers got their lead through a clinicin coral gables. Probably have a source theretipping them off? Sounds about right. How do you wantto play it, mike? How's your liver feeling? We don't have any appointmentsfor several weeks. But if you want, you couldalways try calling other -- I've been calling.I've beento every clinic in town. It's liver damage,for christ's sake. How complicatedcan it be? I understand, sir. Oh, please. Ma'am, I am inp-a-I-n, okay? Let's get somethinggoing here. Sir... no, no, no. That really won't be necessary. I'll seeif we can fit you in. Okay. Thank you. Man. Modern-day healthcare. I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't helpbut overhear. You saidyou're having liver trouble? Yeah. Damn thing'sfalling apart. Have you heard ofhepatodyne? It's an experimental drugout of europe -- did wondersfor my father. Medical scammers, like pimps, drug dealers, of feral dogs, need to protect their territory. They can't let anyone new operate there, or they're asking for problems. I actually --I have some in my car. Sign me up. Like a corporation has a lawyer to handle copyright infringement, a scammer will often have an enforcer to deal with unwanted competition. "Take oneto two tablets by mouth every four hours as needed." ****** And here's my number,if you have any questions. Oh, that's very nice. Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. - Appreciate it. Good luck. - What do you thinkyou're doing? - What? Who the hell are you? - Get out of here. - This is a public place. I have every right. You want a problem? Is that a gun? I'll call the police. And then what? You gonna sell them some pills? There's already somebodyworking this place. What's the problem here? - You with her? - Yeah. We're sorry. We didn't mean to move inon your score, all right? Look, there's plenty of money to be madein that clinic, right? Maybe we can work together. What's your name? As a spy, the best approach is usually to become a target's friend. - It's todd. - Yeah, I'm donny. Good to meet you. I'm a lefty. Sorry. Some situations, though, call for a different approach. Subtle. I like it. ******** *********** Used to be some kind of gallery. My buddy'sthe building manager. They're gonna remodelin a couple of months, but for now we gotthe whole place to ourselves. This is perfect, sam. Looks likeyour pal's waking up. Just sit tight --be with you in a bit. Securing a room isn't about walls. A determined captive can kick through plasterboard, but he can't bite through steel bars or pry out screws with his fingers. Though it might be fun to watch him try. You're sure aboutthis treatment in arizona? I mean,as sure as I can be. You go aheadand make the arrangements. What? You got the money back? You serious? Not yet... but I will. Listen,I appreciate you trying, but I really don't thinkyou know what you're up against. You just callthe treatment center, you sign jack up,and make plane reservations. Okay. Just got a lot of stuffto put in order. I need to find some placeto put jack. I know someonewho can babysit. You're doing a job? What about your brother? He's sitting ina jail cell, michael. - I'm handling it. - Yeah? You almostgot yourself killed. I'm handling it. Will you do this favorfor me, please? Hi, there, sweetheart. What do you say you and i go find some toysfor you to play with? Would you like that? What kind of toys? Michael's old toys. Most of them are blown-upor taken apart. But I bet we could finda few good ones. Want to? Let's go. He's a good boy. I got it. Thank you. Michael, what am I supposedto do here exactly? Someone came after mewith a bomb. I don't want thathappening here. I was supposedto meet campbell. I'm spread a little thinright now, fi. Please. What do you want? You guys got a great little scamgoing down here. We want in. What do you want,a job application? You're good. You're a funny guy, todd. "Job application." No. You know how it iswhen you get to a new area. You got to doa little research -- know the competition, the business environment. So... tell me all aboutyour little business, starting withyour co-workers. Get out of my face. I got nothingto say to you. Nothing? That's disappointing. There's a saying in interrogation -- "violence perceived is violence achieved." You don't want someone screaming. You want him asking questions -- asking, "what is he doing with that knife?" Now, why would you wantto disappoint me like that? That hurts me. That hurts me like this. Asking, "if he'll do that to himself, what will he do to me?" That is a sharp knife. Mostly you want him asking, "how do I make this stop?" What do you want? Stop! I just want to knowabout your business. There's nothing to know. I workedwith this guy a couple times. He said he hadthis medical scam. They needed some muscle, so they broughtme in. That's it. Tell me about this guy. Yeah, mike. I think we've got something. A guy named philip -- hangs out at a bar in south beach named teasers. Nice work, sam. Thanks. I got to get some band-aids. Nearly getting killed shakes you up, no matter how much experience you have. Brushes with death are like snowflakes. Each one is unique and icy cold. Kenny, it's michael. I need you to meet me tomorrow. I need a little helpfinding someone. Now, when you see him, just point him out to me, okay? - Yep. Okay. - Calm down. The guy sold fake medicinefor my kid, you know? I know. Breathe. - That's him. - All right, which one? The guy with -- Kenny! Hey, you son of a bitch! ****** How's that feel, huh? You like that? You need some medicine? All right. You want to kill him, or youwant me to solve your problem? Don't answer that. Just go back to the car. Go. "Never." You're sure? Yes! I don't knowwho they are. The guy saidhe wanted in on the scam. And you told them where I was,how to find me. What the hellwere you thinking? He had a knife. You thinkI'm gonna get cut up just to keepyour name out of it? I had no choice! They were withthat guy kenny -- the one with the little kid. You know anything about that? Maybe they triedto rip him off, too. I told you! I don't know! Could they be cops? They're not cops. That I know. Did you tell them about... no, man, of course not. Keep it that way 'cause thatbitch will kill us in a second. And trust me. I've seen what she can do. We got more to worry aboutfrom her than we do from these guys,whoever they are. Yeah, mike, I think we finallygot something we can use. There's a boss. She sounds like a hard case. Good. I'll be right over. It's time to play"who talks first." Aw, mike, are you sure? You know I don't likedoing that kind of stuff. Mike? All righty, then. Listen, just tell uswho you are, what you want. We can work this out. Hey, you want in on the scam,huh? Let's talk. We'll cut you in. It's good money. What do you want? - I got 5 grand cashback at my place. It's yours. - Shut up! The "who talks first" interrogation technique originally involved taking two blindfolded prisoners up in a helicopter and tossing one out to get the other to talk. Jesus! When a helicopter's not available, any tall building will do. What is this? We're gonna havea little conversation. One of you is gonna tell meall about your boss... and the other oneis gonna go out the window. Keep your mouth shut. - Yeah, but you -- - shut up! So, who's feeling talkative, huh? You? How about you? Okay, guys. Last chanceto volunteer. Anybody,anybody at all? Okay. Eeny... meeny... miney... mo. You don't actually want to kill anyone. The screaming is all you really need. Rachel! The boss's name is rachel! Oh, my god. Todd -- Todd is gone, philip. Todd hasleft the building. Tell me about rachel. I was working a scamup in fort lauderdale. She found me up there. Stay focused. She works clinicsall over town. What do you want? I want you to call her. Set up a meeting. Tell heryou met some new talent, some folks you thinkshe should know. Yeah. Right? Yeah. So, I've beenworking through the paperwork to get himinto the program. And they're asking for... - you'll have the money. - Okay. How? I'm meetingwith rachel later. Uh, mike gets her goingon a new scam -- something we can taketo the cops. Now, you hold that over her head, she'll cough up the money. Hello. Hello, michael. There's a car waiting for youin the street. Apparently,I have a meeting. Go. I'll handle it,brother. This happens all the time. Any time now. The drugstoresells blindfolds now. Just old-fashioned,I guess. We havea new job for you. Really? 'Cause last we spoke, I got the sense I wasn't up for employee of the month. Something change? I thinkyou're gonna like this job. We want youto try and find whoever it wasthat tried to kill you. Oh, like a lead investigator, huh? Something like that. And if that doesn't work, you're hoping they'll takeanother shot at me and expose themselves. The point is someone out therewants you dead, and we bothneed to know who. Michael... we don't want to loseour new operative, and I'm assuming you don'twant to lose your life. Get my brotherout of jail. We can do that. He'll be released afterhis arraignment on thursday. Is that all? 'Cause I have some place to go. Yes -- your side job. Say hi to all the desperatelittle people for me, huh? I thinkhe could use some company. Well, I'm newto the babysitting thing. Do I sing songs or... Honey, there's no point in pretendingthat you're mary poppins. It's just not in you. Just be yourself. Go with what you know. - Do you want to play army men? - Okay. my guy hasan m2 browning . 50 caliber. It's a belt-fed weapon,so it's big and hard to hide, but it's gotgood range, though. So I thinkhe would shoot... from up here. Let me see your guy. Okay. Your guy has a mark 2 pineapplefragmentation grenade -- short range. So he needs a really, reallygood hiding place. In the flowerpot. Let's see if we can get yousome more tactical support. - Hello. - Fi, it's me. Hey, michael. How'd the meeting go? Fine. I've officially been hiredto find the guy that tried to kill me. Uh, fi, we need to... yeah, I'll be therein a bit. We're playing army men. Binoculars. For the truly security conscious, there's no better meeting place than a pool of water. Even if you manage to hide a bug in your swim trunks, chlorinated water conducts electricity well enough to short out any listening device. You're rachel? ***** Kate? My associate, donny. Yeah,rachel. Good to meet you. Philip saidyou had an opportunity. He sounded impressed. Listen, we don't have to competewith each other. You workmostly terminal cases? They're simpler. Yeah, the folkswe deal with -- they're gonna be aroundfor a while, taking a lot of pillsfor the rest of their lives. A lot of money there. We can work together. You find a prospect for us,you steer them our way. We find someone on the way out,they're all yours. Nobody walks away. We both win. Sounds interesting. We just want to operate herewithout stepping on your toes. We just want to be friends. All right. To friendship. Donny, be a sweetheartand get the check. Rachel and ineed to talk. - I'm curious. - Yeah? What is the age mixof your marks? Mm, older mostly. But the kids are wherethe real money is. I mean, parents will shell outwhatever it takes, no matterhow hopeless it is. And that's a score. And when it's over,half the time they thank you and they're hugging you, crying, and you're thinking, "you just paid for my housein keystone island." In covert work, you try to make friends with the bad guys. But sometimes you just can't pull it off. Once it's clear that you'renot going to be friends... who are you, huh? You have to resolve the situation as quickly and as cleanly as you can. Sometimes you can't pull that off, either. Sorry. As she was talking,I just kept thinking about jack, and I --I couldn't help it. It's not your fault. I'm mad at myself. Go back to my mom's house. Make sureeverything's okay there. What are you gonna do? What I have to. Any luck finding rachel? No. Talked to myfed buddies. Had them runa trap-and-trace, but she uses a dial-back system out of eastern europe for that phone. So, we're notfinding her then? Not that way, mike. Where are you going? I'm gonna get the money. Wait, what are youtalking about?Rachel's not -- not rachel. From carla. She's offered cash before. Mike, come on. You don't evenknow where to find her. I'll buy a plane ticketleaving miami. She'll find mesoon enough. You and I both knowthis is a bad idea. You take carla's money, andshe's got her hooks into you. What else can I do, sam? I promised I'd get the money! There's no other way! I want to save this kid, too, but I'm not gonna let youdo this. Now, look, I knowit's been rough on you. So I understandthat you're a little edgy. Move, sam. Move. Not bad, mike. You can hit meall you want, but I'm gonna stand here till you get your headback in the game. That's all she said --"house on keystone island." That's a lotof houses there. I mean,it's a nice neighborhood, but we'd be knocking on doorsfor a month. We have her phone number. Do you think I couldlure her out? No. She's careful,she's smart. She follows her instincts. She's gonna lay low. What do you wantto do, mike? Fi, can you getyour boyfriend to lend ushis ambulance tomorrow? He's got an idea. See, I knewit. I knew he'd come through. He hits me in the mouth a couple times,and he gets an idea. Can you do it, fi? Michael, if I ask campbellone more time -- please.I'm not asking for me. Using sound to determine an enemy's position is one of the oldest techniques in a war, whether it's putting an ear to the ground or bouncing sonar off a submarine. If you can get your enemy on the phone, that opens up new possibilities. Hook up your cellphone to an amplifier and a computer that can analyze sound, and you have a powerful weapon, if you know how to use it. I thinkwe're good to go. Oh, I think we are, too. Here we go. ****** Look, fiona,we need to talk. Yeah. When michael'son the phone, you drive down the streetwith the siren on. We use the sound to -- yeah, I know, I know.That's not what I meant. Look, fiona,you're a great girl. I mean, you're excitingand you're passionate. I just don't thinkI can take this. Campbell. Look, you and mike -- I mean,I know you have a history. But he's your boyfriend... not me. No, he's not. You're -- no.I'm a guyyou fool around with and you borrowambulances from. He's the most important thingin your life. That's him, isn't it? You know, it's okay. I know you're alwaysgonna answer when he calls. ******* It's time, fi. Let's go. Running an operation is like poker. Ideally, you've got good cards, and you play them well. When your cards are bad, though, you have to know how to bluff. - Hello? - Yeah,rachel. Yeah, yeah, it's donny. What do you want? You pissed off my bosspretty bad yesterday. She wanted me to call youwith a new offer. A new offer? Yeah. You settle with usfor 250 grand. You clear out of miami. You want a quarter-milliondollars or what? Or your little girlfriend'sgonna come after me again? I'll take my chances. Yeah, keep laughing. There's an ambulancecoming down your street, rach. You know what it's for? I called that ambulancefor your guys -- you know,todd and philip. You want to saygoodbye to them? Say goodbye to rach. Get us out of here, rachel! I don't think that ambulanceis gonna get here in time. 250 grand and you clear out,or you're next. Forget it. You're not getting anything. Suit yourself, rach. I'm coming for you. See you soon. Fi, tell me you got that. In modern warfare, a well-positioned microphone can tell you anything from where troops are moving to where a sniper is firing from. The same basic technology will also tell you when an ambulance passes someone talking on a cellphone. Got it, michael. Looks likewe're in business. Thanks, sam. You'd do the samefor me, mike. Hi, there. Look who's back. You want 250 grand? I can do that. Nah, that offer expired. She's all excitedabout shooting you now. You don't want to do this. Don't waste your time. When she gets like this... As long as you're on the street,we got a problem. Trust me. It's simpler this way. Oh, there's got to beanother way. We can make a deal. We can't take the risk. Unless somebody's deador in jail, she gets itchy. Okay, wait! Wait! What if I go to jail? Jail? Oh, think about it. I'm out of your way. There's a half a milliondollars in this house. It's yours. Don't look at me. She's the boss. It's simpler this way. Yeah, I hear you,but it's messy. The wall --we'd have to clean it up. Besides, we coulduse the start-up money. Fine. - Phone. - Money. Dial first. You figure we can't shoot youafter we call the cops. Yeah, you're smart. Real smart. It's in the cabinetbehind the liquor bottles. I need to speakto the police. I want to report a crime. Yeah, I'll hold. Oh, and this confession --make it convincing. Because the dayyou get out of jail... You're serious? T-that's all for jack? It's a little morethan you need for the treatment. Take the rest,start a college fund. - What happened to, uh... - rachel? She confessedto an impressive list of scams. She won't be aroundfor a while. Cops foundtodd and philip hog-tied behindthe miami police station. I-I don't knowwhat to say. I'm glad I could help. Oh, and thankyour friend, too, 'cause jackcan't stop talking about her. He, uh --he drew this. That's, uh... you and her together. Tell him thanks. You'll findanother boyfriend. Not like campbell. He was sweet and cute. He had otherimpressive qualities. I'm sorry. Are you? I want you to be happy. I got the chemical analysis backfrom the explosion. Shaped charge --professional. However, they couldn'tgo out the front door after they set it. If theywent off the balcony... I could checkthe security cameras at the businessesalong the river. You're reallygonna do this? Hunt them down? Worth a try. The enemy of my enemycould be my friend. It's from jack. Thanks again, fi. Hello, michael. Carla. You're here. I helped myselfto a yogurt. I hope you don't mind. Funny thing -- I poisoned all my yogurtsjust in case you came by. Even you aren't that good. A part of you --a little part of you -- is wondering if I am. I see youbought a new door. Any progressfinding our bomber? Nope. Checked the blast. Crude I.E.D. Amateur hour. We recruited youbecause you're a good liar. I guess we can't complain toomuch when you lie to us, hmm? But know this -- one way or another, I expect results. Understand? Loud and clear. Good. Doing your own errands? It's not like you. Exceptional timescall for exceptional measures. When you've spent enough time as an operative, recovering from a brush with death isn't about an
