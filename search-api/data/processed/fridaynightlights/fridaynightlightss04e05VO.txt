Y'all got nothing to be ashamed of. Y'all got nothing to be ashamed of! Let's hear it! Listen up now! Listen up. Y'all do me a favor. Y'all take a knee real quick. Most of you know Matt Saracen. Some of you know him better than others. A few of you have played with him before. You might have heard that his father passed away. The funeral's gonna be in a couple days. Thought it'd be nice if maybe we say a word for him and his family. Lance? Bow your heads. Our Father, who art in heaven. Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Hello. This is first sergeant Henry Saracen in Mosul, Iraq.</i> It's your son. It's dad, it's me.</i> I wish you, mom, and you, Matt, Want to wish the two of you a merry Christmas.</i> You got company. Bad movie night, Matt. It's not an option. Grandma's sleeping, so keep it down. I'll make some popcorn for you. Thanks. How was the game? It was good. Twinkle toes over here kicked two points. Twinkle toes? That is not my nickname. - I think it should be. - It's golden foot. I think I like this one, Matt. A lotta hands. Yeah, I guess. What's this? It's just this video that my dad sent me a couple Christmases ago. Matt, I sent you something in the mail.</i> Hopefully, by now you got it. - <i>This hat looks dumb.</i> - 50 bucks. We're doing a good job here. Gonna be out of here soon. So I just wanted to wish you a merry Christmas.</i> That's good. That's nice. - What do y'all think of this one? - Is that a hand? - I liked it. - It's good. Let's go watch the movie. 4x05: THE SON Subtitles: Team Lions With the participation of: Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb, Jenn, Ju, Loky, Nam - Hello? - Hey, did you read the paper today? Paper? I don't get a paper, coach. Well, you got your face in the paper as one of the players of the week. My picture? How do I look? You look like an idiot. That's how you look. - Okay. - <i>Picture looks great.</i> Yeah, but we still lost. I understand that. It means you played a hell of a game though. Listen, they want you to come over for the pancake breakfast.</i> It's at 1:00. They have you speak to, you know, the little guys, the pop warner kids and stuff. You do that? But why is it called called a breakfast? It's at 1:00. Wouldn't it be a lunch? I don't know why they do that. That's just what they call it. Can you be there then, right? - I like pancakes. - <i>Alright.</i> - Good-bye. - Daddy, we need you now. Hey, mom! We ain't got no electrics, no nothing. Come on. I know. I think the best thing she could do right now is just quit. I'm serious, that's just wrong. Why the xylophone? This whole thing is confusing. Shiftless son of a bitch. What? My ex, her dad. Gonna miss her singing again. Always... gone somewhere. He never shows up. That was wonderful. Next up in the Miss Young Texas pageant,</i> we have Miss Becky Sproles! Of East Dillon. Miss Becky Sproles will be singing the song</i> Popular <i>from the musical The Wicked. It's just Wicked. So you just have to know, Matt, that what your dad did... What your daddy did was important. I mean, right now I know it seems real far away, but we're over there for a reason. And your daddy knew that. He was a hero. And that will give you strength. - Thank you, Mr. Garrity. - Remember that. I will. - Excuse me. - I've got some food... Matty, you haven't moved from that chair in an hour. I don't really need to. Everybody just keeps coming up to me. All I gotta do is say thank you. And grandma's over there... He stepped on an I.E.D. How long do these things go for? You know what? Screw you, Bull. The pageant goes for another two days. You know what, you can still get here. I don't care! I really don't care if you're hauling pieces of Jesus' cross back to Bethlehem. You promised her you were gonna be here, and you are gonna be here. This is so damn typical of you, you... Do you have any idea what you're doing to this girl? Any idea? She was so disappointed. She sang her heart out, and you didn't hear anything. That new place that just opened up by <i>Smitty's</i>... Excuse me, boys. Excuse me. It's the telephone for you, Tim. Really? - Why are you getting a phone call? - I don't know! Yeah, I know. I just...</i> I tried your cell, at work, so I figured you must be at Matt Saracen's.</i> What are you doing right now? I'm at a wake. You know what a wake is? Yeah, I just... I figured that you weren't close to the dead guy, but if you are, sorry, I'll hang up now. What's the problem? What is it, the trailer's on fire or what? No, I just... I just wanted to tell you that... Thanks for coming today. It meant a lot to me. You're welcome. You did good, and good luck. You'll probably win, so don't blow it. You really think so? Alright, I gotta go. - Thanks, bye. - <i>I'll see you around.</i> Wait, so... your job is, like, to see the bodies home or something? I'm a recruiter, mostly here in west Texas. But this is an honor job. - So you didn't even know my dad? - No. But I do my best to find out about every man. Heard he... was quite the joker... in his unit. A funny guy. - My dad? - Yeah. He always kept up morale. Did practical jokes and such. It's important. Yeah, no, I'm sure it is, but I'm also sure that wasn't my dad. I bet he was a really good soldier and all that, but he wasn't a funny guy. He was not funny ever. So maybe you talked to the wrong people. Maybe it was another guy who was the joker, but my dad was not. - I've never seen him smile in his life. - Excuse me, Matt. I think someone's... someone's asking for you. Yeah, thank you for coming. Are you okay? I don't know... I don't even understand why they send this guy. He's never seen my dad before in his life. We all know that he was not a very funny... I know. That's why... the Riggins clan and myself, we're gonna take you out of here tomorrow night, away from all the death and the dying - and the deviled eggs. - Yeah, fine. Whatever, fine. I just don't want... talk about my dad anymore. - Hey, Matt. - Our condolences. - On behalf of the boosters... - Are you serious? Excuse me? On behalf of the boosters and the entire Panther organization, we just... Alright... Wassup Cafferty? I'm running, man. I think he's mad that I'm co-conference player of the week. - That's what I'm pissed about. - See this right here? Look. That's me. That's J.D. McCoy, right there. But I'm sharing this with this guy. I don't know who he is. Vince Howard? Do you know him? Come to think of it, I recall spending a couple hours in jail with this guy. How I got there? Considering my friends were with me at the time, Kevin and... what did you say your name was, J.D. McDick? Look, the cops were there, okay? We took off. I'm sorry. - You're a jackass. - What do you want me to do? Get out and beg you? You want me to do that? I'll do it. We're both sorry. All right, but... we're going paintballing tomorrow night. We want you to come. - It'll be fun, come on. - I'll think about it. All right, but right here. Give it to me. Luke, we'll see you around, man. We're sorry. Later, bud. - Julie will sit here with you. - Good idea. - You don't think she'll get hot? - No, she'll be fine. Julie's with her. She'll be okay. Don't you worry, okay? What you've got here is what we like to call our american hero memorial package. Now, this comes with your choice of a mahogany or cherry wood casket. The standard outer burial container. - What's that? - Well, over time, the caskets themselves deteriorate in the soil, the moisture. And since veteran affairs will be picking up most of the bill, you can honor your father in a manner he deserves. Right, thanks. There's the embalming... - Is my dad here? - He's being prepared right now. Do I see him? I think, in this case, a closed casket is most appropriate. Right, right. Actually, if that's okay, can I ask one question? Sorry to interrupt. This viewing/visitation day, use of facilities, use of staff, day prior. That wouldn't be necessary if it's a closed casket, so we can get rid of those charges. That would be great. Thank you. Now see, the rest is laid out. This is for the funeral service escort. I don't understand that either. What does that mean exactly? Those are the cars that will... for the family, friends. They have cars. I mean, we all have cars. Yeah, and... And my grandma's in the car right now, so... So can we just sign whatever this is... Why don't you go on out there? I can finish up with him. We're at the end of it anyway. - You go now. - You sure? Yeah, I think so. - All right, I think this is just... - Thank you. - You have any questions, call me. - Yes, sir. - Thanks. - I'll be right there. I need to ask you a quick question with all due respect, does that boy look like he can pay $9,000 to bury his father? Veterans affairs will be picking up... Look me in the eye, tell me veterans affairs will pick up a $9,000 bill. No, not the entire $9,000. - But they do pick up a large portion. - Okay, we need to start over from the beginning and quickly. Do you have another listing you can give me? Keep your hands to yourself. We're looking for old cars like this. - What is this, man? - Old models, man, all right? See when they stop making the cars, they stop making the parts. - So the parts worth more. - Like a bunch of junk parts in here. You see a new car, think it's sharp, think it's fly, You need to walk away. Walk away? Why? - Cause they got that lojack. - We're in west texas. Ain't nobody got no lojack. You walk away cause half them new cars got them steering locks. Lojack, what's wrong with you? I told him his braids too tight. He don't listen. - Watch out. - Watch out, what? Both of you need to shut up. This is school, the more you talk, the more you miss. and the more likely your bitch asses are gonna do something stupid. This place where you put the keys in, it's called a tumbler. You stick your screwdriver in it, jiggle it a little bit. Sometimes, the dashboard might come on. Sometimes the engine. Don't panic. Be cool and get paid. Most of the times, this ain't an option. Then you gotta hot box the bitch. Come in closer. This is the magic. - We're gonna leave in a minute. - Yeah, all right. That was really nice of your mom. I appreciate it. She's good in crisis. She's pretty much built for crisis. She's invited you over for dinner tonight If you want to come. I said you probably had family stuff to do but... if you want to get away for an hour, I'd love to see you. Okay, you'll come or...? Yeah, I'll... okay, I'll come. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I just... You know, this stuff happens. Now it's happening to me. Someday it's gonna happen to you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. That was a stupid thing to say. It's okay. So, what time is this dinner? Koala bears, do you know what they eat? Do you know what they eat? And that's more than enough for a first down.</i> That makes it six carries for 38 yards.</i> I'm not saying this young man's ready to start, but Brian "Smash" Williams</i> - <i>is making the most of this blowout.</i> - Look at him run, look at him go. - How 'bout that? - Look at y'all... Hi, sweet girl. - How you doing? - Did y'all have fun? It's almost time for a nap for you. How'd it go? It went... Somebody ready for a nap? Maybe we'll both lie down together for a nap. Here, here, here. Take that with you. All right. How's he holding up? He's trying. I'm not going anywhere. - Who's your favorite football player? - You heard of Johnny Unitas? My old coach used to tell me about Johnny Unitas. I remind him a lot of him. See that old man in the back, one of the oldest guys in this room? That's my dad. He taught me everything. You gotta be fast and know the plays. You gotta look around, see everything. When I step to the line, I see everything happening before it happens. I'm a good one or two seconds ahead of the coverage. The boy scout's pretty arrogant. - He's got a hell of an arm. - Be a hero, win championships. I see it in you. All right? Thank you, J.D. Now for our other <i>Dillon Gazette</i> conference player of the week, Vince Howard of the East Dillon Lions. Now some of you kids here, this is your first year in pop warner, but guess what? This is Vince's first year too. Pay attention, all right? You've got a role model here. What do you say, Vince? You got some words for these players? What am I supposed to say? Just talk about the game. Just tell 'em about it. Don't panic, all right? Stay cool, and you'll get paid. Stop. Hold on. - Seriously, get away from me. - One, two, say it. No regrets. That feels good. That was really close. You guys remember the state final game three years ago? No, Billy. - What game? - Stop messing with me, man. Are you really reminiscing about three years ago? There was ten seconds left on the clock. We had Matt "Mayday" Saracen sitting back there behind the center. Never has he been called "Mayday". We need to come up with a nickname. I like "Cobra." It's got a good sound to it. Hey, cobra, think fast. You're Cobra. Dude. - Why would you kill Cobra's beer? - I know. Let's see your hands. You guys know I have to give a eulogy at this thing tomorrow? I got to get up there in front of everybody and say good stuff about this man. And all I really want to say is, "Here lies Henry Saracen. "His mother annoyed him. "His wife couldn't stand him. "And he didn't want to be a dad, so he took off to be in the army, "that was the only way you could come up with to get out "and ditch all responsibilities and no one could call you out on it. "And that worked out great, so you decided to enlist 4 more times, "and that ended up getting you killed and now here you are. "All you got left, all you left behind is a mother with dementia, "a divorced wife, and a son "who delivers pizza. "Thank you for coming, 100 people I do not know." And the worst part is, even if I did get up there and say that, even if I finally did like, say all that to him, I don't know if I'd be saying it to him because I don't know if he's in that damn box. It's a closed casket. For all I know, it's someone else. It's someone funnier. Or a bunch of rocks. There's only one way to find out then. Right? Cobra, you got the key. - There's no key. - Break the window. - There's probably a door. It's stuck. - Just break it. All right, go in. - You sure we're supposed to be doing... - You're wasted. - Where is he? - That's where I saw him before. Hold on. All right, it's this guy. Hey, Matt. - My friend... - Hold on. My friend wants to see his old man. I want to see my dad. I thought we agreed earlier - that that wasn't a good idea. - Look, he wants to see his dad. Hey all of you, just stop, stop. Landry... Look, I know what we decided earlier, but now I want to see my dad. Now. - That's him? - Yeah. - Son, this isn't a very good idea. - I appreciate that but, please just open it. Thank you. Matt, you all right? Pictures, baby! I thought we were going to the field, man, come on. We are going. We're just getting a little practice. Cut that out, dude. You're getting paint on my truck, man. This truck is a piece of crap anyways. Don't worry. It's a piece of crap I had to pay for with my own money, dumbass. - Get this pedestrian right here. - I got him. Don't shoot him! Oh, my God! What are you doing? - Why are you stopping the car? - Get out. - Get out the truck! - Hey, yo, relax. You got some kind of chip on your shoulder, man. Look, that school you go to is a dump, okay? We all know this. Do you want us to lie to you? So every time we get to hang out, I'll be the one you all look down on? We don't look down on you! We look down on you with you. That's right. That was good, man. - All right, jokers, that's funny. - Come on, Luke. - Get out. - Why you gotta do this? - What's your problem? - What's my problem?! You're my problem. - What are you doing, dude? - I'm not going paintballing. You know what? Screw you, Luke! How does it feel being second best on the worst team in Texas? - All right. - Better watch it. Come on, man. Luke, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry too. You're done, dude. - Come on. What are you doing? - Get off my truck. You're kidding! Screw you, Luke! How did it go? Second runner-up. That's, uh... That's third, right? - Then, I guess it's not really... - Third place sucks. So, how was your day? Weird. Weird, how? I saw something that, uh... Rather I saw someone that see something that... You ever just feel completely useless? You're not useless. Right. Close your eyes. Just do it. This... This can't happen. I can't do this. You got I.D.? It's for my mama. She ain't feeling too good. I need to see I.D. You know, I walked... You're almost out of soap. Becky, right? There you go. That doesn't look good. - What do you think? - I think you ought to buy something. We're together. This is my stuff. My I.D. - Thanks. - Sure. - Thanks again. - Yeah, yeah. My name's Luke. I know who you are. See you later. You want to go to a car wash? I got to go to a car wash. Look at that thing. Sure. - Why the hell not? - All right. Why the hell not? You want to get that, sweetie? Sorry, uh... I know I'm really late. It's okay. We saved you a plate. Thank you. Mrs. Taylor, I'm sorry... You're fine, honey. We saved you a plate. We saved our dessert for now. We'll have dessert with you, you're fine. Sit down, don't you worry. - You drive? - No sir, no. I had a nice walk, though. You don't have to eat if you don't want to. I'm hungry. Do you want something else, hon? I'm sorry, I don't like carrots, and I don't... like when they touch the meat, so... - I'll take it away. - Don't worry about it. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, it's fine. I'm being rude, I'm sorry. - Honey, you're fine. - I don't like being rude. I think I'm just having a moment here. I'm just having a moment, I don't think I'm okay. I hate him. And I don't... I don't like hating people. I just put all my hate on him so I don't have to hate anybody else. So that I could be a good person... to my grandmother, to my friends. To your daughter. That's all I want to say. I just want to tell to his face I hate him. But he doesn't even have a face. I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor. I see y'all tomorrow. - Matt, you don't have to go! - Julie. It's alright, honey. - Come here, sweetie. - You're gonna let him go like that? It'll be alright. Your dad is gonna talk to him, honey. Why didn't you do something? We can't just let him hurt like that. I'm gonna walk you home. - Looks good. - It's pretty. Look at his picture. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen Now, Matt would like to share some words of his remembrance with us. I'm just gonna tell you one... one story I remember and that will be it. We were at... a supermarket. It was me, my mom, Grandma, and my dad. All four of us, a whole family. My dad was pushing the cart, and he stopped to grab... some toilet paper, put it in the cart and my grandma said: " No, that's not the right one. That's not the paper that we use." And she grabbed the right toilet paper and put it in the cart... and stormed off. And my dad just kind of stared off at her, then, he grabbed all the toilet paper off the shelf and put it in the cart. I mean, he just stacked it full of... And it wasn't spiteful or nothing. I don't know, maybe you had to be there, but as a six-year-old, it was the funniest day I've seen. I just laughed about it for weeks. I guess... my dad was just a funnier person than he really let on. He was kind of private in that way, and I don't even know why. But one thing he wasn't private about was his service. He was in the army for... 20 years and that was something he was... He was proud of. He missed... He missed all my birthdays. He missed a lot of me growing up. But I think the point is that I got to grow up. That I got to have those birthdays. He went and did a job... that not many people want to do. Because of that, we all get to be here, we get to grow up and we get to have our birthdays. I think that's something to be proud of. So, thank you... for being here and my family thanks you. On behalf of the president of the USA and our grateful nation, for the service rendered by your loved one. Thank you. Thank you. You're all invited now
