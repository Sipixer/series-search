- You got one of ours, why shouldn't we get one of yours? - You are an interesting girl. - Thanks. You make me feel too much. It's just a little time to think about things. I can't wait around till you realize that I can't. I don't know what else to do. Good night. What we gonna do about the house? We gotta get $2000 in two weeks. Get your crap, let's get out of here. What are you doing? Come on. It's our mortgage. We juste stole $3000 from one of the biggest drug dealers in Dillon. - I don't need a new transmission. - Hold on, let the man talk. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, gentlemen. The transmission's shot. I'm gonna have to pull the housing off, reset the flywheel I might as well drop in a new throw out there. You throw the rest of the damn car away? How much is this gonna cost? 4 or 5 grand. The money at least come with an orgasm? We'll know better once we get in there and see what's wrong. - This car is not even worth 4 grand. - You talking about old Bessie... You told me she was in tip top shape... I told you years ago that you should take better care of old Bessie - and rebuild the transmission... - What? Years ago you know about this? - You can't put all the blame... - Look me in the eye! Buddy, can you get in here? Hey, guys, come on. I have never seen you act like that. What's wrong with you, son? Mr. Garrity, it's just... That guy... He sold me a bad truck, and now, it's gonna cost $4,000 to get it fixed. - Do you know how much money I got? - No, I do not. $8,000. That's half my money. Well... Jason, maybe you just gonna... have to do without a car for a while. You don't understand what it's like to have to rely on people to get you around, all over town, have rides everywhere. I don't fit in most of my friends' cars. I'm gonna have to pay for this truck and hopefully I won't run out of money and move back in with my parents. Tell you something. You ever thought about selling cars? Well... Looky here! Timmy boy Riggins! What's going on, man? What's going down? Not much, you know... I'm just... doing my thing, I guess. You don't come around very often anymore. The ferrets miss you. They're depressed. Boys and I fixing to go hunting. Grab some beer and come with us? Actually, I gotta take care of some stuff, so... Gotta do what you gotta do, huh? Alright, man. - You guys have a good day. - Listen, Tim. Hold up, man. I miss you, you know. I'm worried about you. Worried you might get in with the wrong people, do something stupid. Now, why don't you to tell me where the hell my money is. You got till the end of the week, pretty boy, or I'll shoot your knees off. Let's go. Good luck with the game on Friday! Ma'am, is Brian Williams your son? - Yes, he is. Can I help you? - We have a warrant for his arrest. - An arrest warrant? For what? - On assault charges. - Can your son step out? - Wait a minute. Sorry, Mama. What's going on here? An arrest warrant for what? Something happened last week. I can't tell you, but it's gonna be okay. - Just say your song. - I can't tell you... Y'all ain't got to put no handcuffs on him. We got all served no papers, and y'all just gonna take him away? What's going on here? Watch your head. I don't want this here! 2x13: HUMBLE PIE Subtitles: DarKsh, GillesSilb, Ju, Lemonhead I need someone else to coach that damn volleyball team. Coach Pima up and leaves right in the middle of the season. She up and leaves. Terrible. Can't be you, that's for sure, even if you are athletic director. Can you butter some toasts there for me, babe? Thank you. - I'd love to butter you some toasts. - Thank you, sweetheart. Why... Honey, why are you looking at me like that? You know I can't do it. I don't have time. You used to play varsity volleyball. You know the sport. - Sweetheart, that is irrelevant. - Did you not just say to me - that you want more exercise? - I got Gracie Belle. Well, there you go. You get to work with the girls, you get the exercise. They've got lots of spunk. They're zero and seven this year. They're failing miserably. - You be quiet and eat your breakfast. - When seven is rebuilding. Listen. It is 3 weeks. Period. 4 at most. When? I'll be down there. Alright, thanks, Bill. Alright. What's up? Gotta go to the police station. Smash is down there. I don't know any more. See you in a little. Thank you. You're a good woman. Y'all all know this is one of the finest quarterbacks we ever had here in Dillon. He's gonna be a fine sales associate. Welcome him to our team. I want y'all to treat him like family, teach him the ropes. - Have a good day, Jason. It'll be good. - Thank you, Mr. Garrity. Can you believe this? We're not selling any cars as it is. Now we got competition in a wheelchair. This is great. Great for my mortgage. He couldn't have done this. Tell me you did not do this. Mama, he was talking smack to Noannie. Was I supposed to let it happen? You were supposed to walk away. I told you a million times. You gotta be better than other people. Let me lay out your options. If we make a case that Brian felt threatened, was defending himself, could lead to a messy trial. If he's found guilty, the judge will throw the book at him. On the other hand, given that the injuries weren't too severe and Smash is a respected athlete, I'm pretty sure I can get the ADA to cut a deal. A deal? What kind of deal? - He pleads guilty to a misdemeanor... - No. Listen to this man, now. - I don't need to... - Listen to your mother, would you? I won't sit up here and let you throw away everything, 'cause of your big ignorant ego. Do you hear me? If making a deal makes this thing go away, we gonna listen to what this man has to say. Now please, go on. Good afternoon, I appreciate that you're letting me speak on the altercation I had last week involving white teenagers. I struck someone, which I shouldn't have done and I want to apologize to him and everyone for doing so. I also want to make it clear I've learned from my mistakes and assure you all that it won't happen again. On the container of one leader, S is 3 cmÂ², L is 5... - That gives us... - The frequency would be 130 Hz. Landry Clarke, just the man I need to see. A long time I've seen you. - Hi, I'm Jean. - This is Jean. Sorry. Jean, this is Tyra. Tyra, this is Jean, an old buddy of mine. So, biology quizz. This is about this rat experiment that says pure calories lead to a longer life, or something. It's actually a trick question. The rats that died sooner were fed on sugar and yeast. So, it's sort of a question of diet restriction more than anything else. Thanks, Landry. I appreciate that. I'm gonna get a coke. You want anything? - I'm okay. - Okay, great. - It was nice meeting you. - Bye. - She's got cool hair. - So, using your tutoring skills to seduce freshmen, is that it? No, we actually got paired up for a physics project - so it's kind of mandatory. - She's in your physics class? Looks like she's 12. She's not. She might've skipped a grade or two. - Good luck with that. - Okay. Thank you. The only way to really heal the ravages of sin is to put our trust in the Lord. Give our hearts over to Him. And if we do, miracles will come into our lives. Do you feel the Lord in your hearts? Do you feel Him? Do you feel it? Do you feel the Lord in your hearts? Do you feel alive? Do you feel that a friend is coming here tonight? I am a friend of God... Hey, how are you doing? - What are you doing here? - I gotta talk to you. This is not the place. What happened to your face? I got beat up by three meth addicts yesterday. Why? 'Cause I stole $3,000. Why would you steal $3,000 from meth addicts? It's not important right now. What's important is I wanna talk to you. Come to my place tomorrow night to talk. I'm not coming to your place. ... put our trust in the Lord. I've got something important to say. Tim, I'm not coming. Please, go. - Say yes and I'll leave. - Fine. I'll come to your place. For sure? Tell me you're coming and I'm gone. I'm coming. Watch out! Good start. Over the net! Just pick up the balls. You're here to help, not to coach. Oh, sweetie. Now let's try to see if we can get one back this time, y'all. Talk to each other. Talk to each other. I didn't hear a thing that time. Talk to each other. Focus! And I wanna hear you! So the engine is 217 hp, 217 lbs for the torque. The interior is pretty roomy, plus the Ultralec seating that keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summertime. - It's sold, man. - Excellent! You have the... dual front stage airbags. I don't think you understand. We actually wanna buy the car. - We made up our minds. - Alright. Jason Street, please report to the sales lounge.</i> That's me. Make sure you are in love with the car, then we'll start the paperwork. Thank you. What do you need? What do you think you're doing? I'm selling a car. They wanna buy that car. That's great. That's great. We have rules around here that we all follow starting with the point. The point system. The point system says that higher your sales figures, the higher you are in rotation. If you're number one, as I am, it means you get the first customer through the door at the top of every hour. Second on the list gets the next, and so on. - Got it? - Nobody told me yesterday... That's okay. You're new. You're forgiven. - Just check with me next time, okay? - Okay. Sure thing. Will do. - How do I look? - Great. You know it. We got a new Malibu out here. Have you heard of this girl, Jane? She's in Landry's physics class. She is... long dreads, glasses, short. There's a girl, Jean. She's in my geometry class, with the pink hair. She's interesting, to say the least. She's a brainiac EPI classes into, like, cult movies and music and stuff like that. - How's coaching day, honey? - It was so great. Those girls are so spunky. Some of them don't even know the rules. First day, it's always a reality check. You did not give full disclosure on that one, and that is for sure. Can you girls put those chips away? We're having dinner right now. - Where does it go? - Above the fridge. Can you put that on the table, sweetie? - This casserole is something else. - Thank you, sweetie. I never realized you were so tall. - 5'11". - How about that? You're a tall drink of water. You know in what that'd be great for? Volleyball. - Mom, drop it. - You ever thought about that? It'd be great for your college apps, sweetie. - I'm gonna watch this game. - Okay, sweetie, enjoy that. In the colleges, when they look at the applications, they look at the big picture. Which is why the sports would be a great addition for you. She came over for dinner, not to get lectured. The thing I love about athletics, it's mind, body, spirit. I look at you and I see that it would be real good for you. You look at me and you see a spiker. I do look at you and I see a spiker. You know what I see? A kick-ass spiker. - Nothing wrong with that. - Be honest and ask me for a favor which is what you're getting at right now. Well, you know what? It would be a favor to me. That would be a favor to me. And certainly not that you owe me anything, but it would be very good for you. What are you doing? Wanna get together later, grab a movie? Dinner, something? I'd love to, but I told my mom I'd babysit Buddy Jr. Everything okay? Everything's fine. I'll call you later. - How you doing? - I'm okay. How are you? I'm alright. Come on in. Sit down. I made some chicken. - You what? - I made some chicken. Like, really good. No, seriously, just... Just sit down, please. This isn't me. I'm sorry. These candles... I don't know what that was. I just gotta get something off my chest, Garrity. No, I dont think that's... Seriously, wait. Wait! What? Don't... - I love you. - What? I love you. How am I supposed to react to that? Brutal honesty. Please. It's never gonna happen. - Because of this Cristian Sin guy? - No. You can't tell me that you share whatever we had with this guy. You can't tell me that he knows everything I know about you. You can't tell me that. I don't believe you. Be honest with yourself for two seconds. Look me in the eye and tell me that you don't feel the way I feel about you. Then, I'll move on. I don't feel the way you feel about me. Move on. Beautiful! That's what I'm talking about. See? Told you you could do this, Tyra. There you go! Let's get a smile on that face. You having fun? No. Start havin'... Uh, uh! That's fun! You are getting this. I want you to put some power behind it. I'm trying to put power behind it. Put some of that Tyra power behind it. There you go. Ball in. Let me talk to you for a second. You can do this. You have got the skill, you've got the height, just like I knew. I'm so proud of you, now what we need to do is we need to get that... Tyra power behind it. Tim, if you hit with that ball... Now, what I want is... I want you to find a way to get that... - energy. - I'm trying that! Find something in your head that just drives you crazy, that just bugs you, and then make that be the ball, and just slam on it, you know what I mean? Can you... get something like that in your brain? Yeah, I think I can think of something. That's my girl. Alright. Come on, now. Let's see it. I knew it. Now we're going. Get it right out of it. This bad boy has all the advantages of a hybrid, but if you need to, you can lock the electric motors out of the drive train, when extreme engine power is needed to haul a huge load. Tow of about... I don't know, about 6,000 lbs. Yeah, I don't know. - Well, did you like the way it drove? - Oh yeah, yeah. Okay, well. If it's a matter of price, or of cost, we could probably talk to my supervisor. I'm just gonna look around a little more, alright? - Thanks. - No problem. Come back if you make up your mind. - Hey, Jay. - I figured that. How's it going, babe? Kidding, kidding. How's it going? It's going horribly. That's how it's going. I just... I'm not cut out for this. I'm terrible at this job, Mr. Garrity. I spent two and a half hours with a customer who just walked out on me for no reason right when I thought I was gonna get him, right then and there. To top everything else, the whole crew here hates me, 'cause I messed with the point system. - So, that's how everything's going. - The what? The point system. Where the top seller has... They told you there was a point system? - Yes, sir. - Oh, God! - Annabelle told you that? - There's not point system? No, there's no point system. They lied to you. - Can't believe that little phillie. - She lied to me? She did. And just don't worry about it. You keep your head up. And Gerald, the guy that just came in here? He's a tire kicker. He's a looky-lou, is what I call him. He comes in here every week, twice a week. He looks and never buys. Now you just refocus. Next person that comes in, you find out what they wanna hear, you tell it to them. It's just a job, Jason. That's all it is. Nothing more, nothing less. Some days aren't good. Like Two-A-days. You don't know why you're doing it and then later, it pays off. It's the same thing here. It's all you think. You just keep focused. You can do it. - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - Knock one down. Annabelle! Have you had the sizzling apple pie? - No, I haven't. Is it good? - Yeah, it's really good, it's like... it comes out... sizzling. It'll save your life, it's amazing. It'll definitely help with physics. - What are you gonna get? - Tyra, I didn't know you... your working days, this is a surprise. Yeah, I should have changed. So, can I serve y'all with some water before I come and take your orders? Sounds great to me. Just working on some physics here, so... need some... That's different from school. So... You're wearing a Mayhem shirt. I am. Isn't the singer, like, a cannibal? Cause you're in, like, a Christian power metal band. Seems kinda... Kinda weird. I don't know. No, actually that what just a rumor, he didn't actually eat anyone. And Crucifictorious is actually... it's not power metal, more of... extreme grindcore with, like, heavy thrash influences. Like, what thrash bands do you like? Like, Napalm Death? Like, The Keep? Like, Cannibal Corpse? Carcass? I mean, I really only have two sections for vinyl, like metal, not metal. So... Well, mainly... Y'all ready to order? I want the sizzling apple pie, and I think, also... That's pathetic! Back at the start. What's up? What's the matter? I haven't been honest with you about a couple of things. Okay. I lied to you about babysitting my brother the other night. That guy at church was Tim Riggins. We've kind of a history together. What kind of history? Get the door, Brian. I just came by to say that I'm sorry. Come in. - Hey Noannie. - Didn't mom ban her? Noannie, please. Just watch the show and be easy, a'ight? I just feel so bad about everything, I really cannot believe you had to apologize like that. Wish I could erase that whole date. It's gonna be okay. - This whole thing's gonna blow over. - Just really worried about you. The Smash always lands on his feet. Hello? Who is it? - No, no, I don't. Who is this? - Noannie, give me the phone. You guys are jerks. Stop calling here, or I'm calling the police. Who was that? - No one. - Noannie. It's just some idiots calling, saying stupid things, okay? Like what? - Brian, it's stupid. - Like what, Noannie? He says he hears I put out to white boys. He calls here again, you give the phone to me. Do you hear me? - Do you hear me? - Yeah. This is all my fault, isn't it? No... No. Don't you ever say that. Noannie, look... This has nothing to do with you. Come here. I know, I know. I slept with my paralyzed boyfriend's best friend. It's the worst thing I've ever done. It'd be great if you said something. Sorry, I'm just... thinking how hard that must have been for you to tell me. And I'm... really glad that you did. I just want us to be honest with each other. - You still have feelings for him? - No. Let's go get some ice cream. Just... in a minute. Hey, Street... Here comes your best friend. Oh, that's funny. Somebody's gotta talk to him. Low man on the totem pole, that would be you. Good afternoon, Gerald. Oh, hey. How you doin' today? All right, just... came to have a second look. - Can I ask you something, Gerald? - Yeah. What's the problem, exactly? - Sorry? - Why won't you let yourself have it? - What do you mean? - What is it? Is it that you think if you buy this car, you'll find another car you like better elsewhere, immediatly after buying it? Or is it that you just think you don't deserve the car? You don't know me. No, Gerald, I'm not insulting you. Please, don't take it like that, okay? I'm just trying to understand you. Because all these sales people around here? Take a look at 'em. They sent me because they're giving up on you. They sent me, wheelchair guy, rookie, low man on the totem pole, because no of them believe that you can actually purchase a vehicule. But let me tell you something. I know you love this car. You love this car so much, you come here two days a week. Two days a week to just look at it, then you walk out. Gerald, life's too short, man. Life is too short, okay? Things change in an instant. Take it from me. Okay? So be a man! Take control of your life, be a man! Buy this car. Show these people they're wrong, that you can make a decision. - I'm gonna think about it. - No, no more thinking, Gerald. No more thinking and dithering, no more wasting time. You're wasting your time every time you come in here. Buy this car. Because you love it and because you want this car, and you wanna drive off this lot in this car, today. Buy it. Okay. Okay... Mr. Garrity? Yes, sir! Gerald would like to start paperwork on purchasing this hybrid here. Yes, I was. Congratulations, Gerald. - Congratulations. - Well, thank you. The Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, is the only region in the world - to lay almost entirely... - Are you paying me for that? So, we made an A. - Did we, really? - Yeah... Yeah. That's cool, right? The best grade in the class. Thank you. Also, uh... I made you something. I sensed a bit of reluctance on your part to embraced the cheese that is power metal. So... It's a variant power metal mix. It actually says "parking lot mix". It's like <i>Heavy metal parking lot</i>, you know. Do I have to listen to it in a parking lot? No, cars... bedrooms, whatever. Bedrooms... But it was nice seeing you... See you around. - Bye, guys. - Well, I appreciate it. - Thank you. - Cheers. - Soulmate, right there. - God's little gift to Landry. Why can't you just... I struck someone which I shouldn't have done.</i> Smash, you on TV, homes. I want to apologize to him, and everyone for doing so.</i> Anyone can say "I'm sorry", doesn't mean they are.</i> Smash Williams is an arrogant, violent thug</i> who attacked us because we're white and have money.</i> Everyone is defending him. He's lucky me and my friends acted civilized.</i> And from the Smash Williams controversy, we go now to cabin witt the rest of today's sports...</i> - What the hell are you doing here? - Did you see Adam Hughes on TV... - You're tryin' to get me in trouble. - No, just get the truth. Tell the truth! Just shut the hell up! Just shut the hell up! What happened? Was your sister hittin' on him? Is what he said true? Hell, no, that's not true. That's not true. I'll tell you like this. He was sayin' some foul things to my sister and I. - Racial, sexual and threatening. - That's right? Someone comes to my sister and is talking like that, you just gonna smile? No, you gonna ask him to stop. If they don', you're not gonna do anything? So, you shouldn't have apologized? - Not the way he's talking! - So that's a yes? He didn't deserve an apology. He deserved worse than what I gave him. Should have messed him up worse.</i> And with that latest salvo from Smash Williams,</i> it appears the Dillon Panthers' problems are far from over...</i> Turn it off, will you, Crowley. Hubby's home. How was your day, darling? It was, uh... It was good. It was good. And I sold a car, so... What? You did? Out-freakin'-standin'! Oh, man, you did! So what? You're like a car salesman now, you're like Willy Loman? You're a salesman, uh? Yeah, I guess I am. It's all good. You got a little money in your pocket, nothing wrong with that. Just for now. Good to have a roommate that can pay his half of the rent. Hey, what do you say? You and me, head down to the Rex Center, gotta pick up rugby game going on and maybe go get me some ribs. Some corn, some hot chicks... Maybe she got a friend for you... but one of them ugly ones, bucktooth, you know, just got the fangs, got the fangs happenin'. Uh? You know what? Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah? Just gimme a couple minutes to change, and I will... Wait on me out. Dinner is on you tonight, you still owe me... - I think, what is it, $19.40? - Are you serious about that? Yeah, dinner and girls. Both on you tonight. No, the girls will be on me. I... Rucy, Marino, Ram Dog... I mean, all theses guys started to... invest a couple months back. They're doing well... I mean, so... Iif those idiots can do stuff in the stock market, why can't I? Oh, my God, you're gonna play a grade 9 education to the stock market? I'm not that stup... - Yeah, go. - Be quiet. Sorry... - You okay? - Yeah, yeah... - What's up? - Is Tim here? Yeah. I came to bring you this. What's this? The money you owe those guys... Don't want you to get beat up. - I'm not bringing you into this. - You're not bringing me in anything. This is why you came over? Yeah... And, I'm not... I'm not coming back here anymore. Chris makes me happy. That's it. - I'm not taking it. - Okay. All right. Nice, y'all! That's the way! That's the way! Good teamwork! Y'all need to call it! Watch that hole in the center! Y'all need to pick that up. Hey, time out! Time out! - Looking great. - They're double-blocking me. - It's okay. - They figured out our moves. No! Don't act like this is luck, this is not. Y'all doing a great job! We're kind of lucky, 'cause their star hitter is out sick. Y'all playing a great game. I want you to keep it up and simple, and remember: you're playing and winning this game because of your teamwork. You are a team, you work together. And you, you just focus on that Riggins, you slam it down his throat, got it? You know you can do this. Let's go, girls. - One, two, three... - Panthers! All right, girls. That's what I'm talking about! All right, keep it together! Keep it together! You had fun, right? Good job! Good job! So, what? Now they're like, what, 1 and 7 down? Why you gotta be like that for? Mom is 1 and 1! - The team is 1 and 7... - 1 and 0, 1 for 1! Ready? - What's up? - Let's just get this over with. - Here's your money. - How you doin', Billy? Good to see you. It's all there. I'll see you around. Come on in, let's count it first, make sure it's all here. - No, if you got the money, we're good. - Just bring it in. Okay? I wanna make sure I got my money, so come on in. I'll count. 100, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, - 8, 9... We're up to a thousand? - Yep. At one. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17... 18, 19... Two thousands? Getting closer. What's wrong, Tim? You look a little depressed. Just get this over with, man. Count the money and let's get out of here. You wanna calm down, man? I was the one who get ripped off here! Why you don't call cops then, Guy? Good one, Billy. Breathe. What do you know? It's all there. All right. It's taken care of, it's all paid up and we don't owe you a dime extra. - It's over with now. - I don't want a dime extra. You're not gonna touch him again. I hope he doesn't give me a reason to touch him again... I don't give a crap he gives you one. You're not gonna touch him again! Billy, let's go. - You need to calm down. - Listen to me, you fat son of a bitch! You're not gonna touch him again, you understand me? - How is Jackie? - You don't... Go! This is crap! He's got a gun. Just get in the truck! - I'm trying! - He's got a gun, let's go! Billy, I'm trying! Come on in. Coach here's got something he wanna tell you. Board called... They've decided... to suspend you for three games. Suspend me? - But they can't do that, can they? - They can and they have. Is this 'cause I told a reporter the truth? Baby, that didn't help. But... That's the rest of the regular season.
