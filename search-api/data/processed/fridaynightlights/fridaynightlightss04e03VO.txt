- I do have this trailer. I'm gonna give my daughter a call. Don't you scare her! I'm your new intern. I've got a bunch of crap in here, I need you to start moving it. Why did you forfeit the game? You just quit on us? I've got shame and I apologize to you. Who wants to finish this fight? Let's finish it! Let's finish it! Hey, listen! Ten of you are gonna push the car. Once we get out there, the rest of you hold the helmets and collect the money. Be careful, don't get your feet run over. - Any questions? - Matter of fact, I do. - What is it, Tinker? - Why are we pushing this damn car? One, watch your language. Two, next time, I want whatever that is on your upper lip shaved off. And I'll tell you why we're pushing the car, because it's a fun football fundraiser. And we're gonna have fun, so we're gonna put smiles on our faces right about now. Team comes out, town comes out, money gets exchanged. It's a good thing. Understood? Got it, Coach! Let's be kind and courteous out there. Hello, neighborhood! We're the Lions! Let's hear it, guys! Even at church, everyone is really not being nice to me about this whole Luke Cafferty thing. That's our congregation. All sweet and holy inside the church, then as soon as they get out the door, - bitchy and judgmental. - Well, welcome to the world, honey. It's not gonna be my world. What isn't? Going to church with a bunch of hypocrites. Hypocrites are everywhere. It has nothing to do with church. That's no way to think about it. There's always gonna be some bad apples, but church is about you and God... So if it's just about me and God, why can't I just worship at home? I mean, I think that church is also about community and family and you know, there's just a lot to it. We need your quarters, your dollar bills,</i> your good wishes in monetary fashion!</i> Let's hear it, boys! Not feeling love out there. You feeling love? Tink, shut up, stop sweating on me and push this piece of junk, okay? We got forty bucks, people! Thank you, good people of the street!</i> Good to see ya! Thank you very much! Thank you very much! We are the East Dillon Lions! Feed us! Feed us! - I'm out. - What do you mean? - I'm out of money. - What do you mean? - I'm out of money. - Listen to me. It's all I got left. That's about a 100 bucks. Don't give it all to one person. Spread it out. - I'm trying, some are taking it. - Give it to people who don't take it. Look at these boys pushing this car for ten miles!</i> There's your tricycle. - What? - The tricycle! That's great. I need you to drive me to Clearwater on Tuesday. I need to pick up some metal so I can finish this piece of crap. Why do you call everything you work on crap? Because it is all crap. I call the Mona Lisa crap. In fact, the Mona Lisa is crap. There are better things I call crap. Clearwater is 200 miles away. - Just about. - Right. And I got a shift I gotta do so... I mean, I can't take the whole day and chauffeur you up there. You're here to learn about art from an artist! You can't take a day off because you got a shift to deliver pizza?! We already have uniforms. Why do we need new ones? - Because I burned the uniforms. - Taylor... I burned them. That's what you do. They were damn 30 years old. This is not like I just burned them for no reason. You end the old cycle, you start the new, Levi. You know, you get rid of the past. Fact of the matter is the team and I we went out and we made up a good amount of money, it's just that... Now we're just a little shy of what we need and all I'm asking is you and the school is, you know... if you'd help us with the downpayment. We can pay for the rest. I don't think you understand the financial situation here. We ain't close to talking about more money for football. Levi, it's expensive starting up a new football program... Starting up a new football program is a little premature. Let's see if we can finish up some games before we start writing checks. What is that supposed to mean? If you can't finish games, I can't keep this program going. Students are getting hurt. I don't want no jokes down at the school board meetings. I'm tired. Either you turn it around or we're gonna shut it down. What do you mean? You're gonna shut down the program? You weren't even supposed to take this job! Or to be here. So you're the only that didn't get the joke. 4x03: IN THE SKIN OF A LION Subtitles: Team Lions With the participation of: Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb, Jenn, Ju, Nam, Tactactac Morning! I made you toast. Are you serious? It's worth it, eat it. What time is it? Morning. And since you're up, anyways, can you give me a ride to school? Come on. Put some pants on. Watch your head. Watch your head! Hurry up! I'll be waiting in the truck. Here you go, sweetheart. There. Here's your sippy. - Hey, Honey. - Good Morney, Grace. You know, yesterday in church, all that stuff you were saying... Do you feel like we're making you go to church or... It's not like you're making me go to church, it's just... You know, something that we all do as a family. It's like a tradition, but... If you stop going, then I don't think I'd probably keep going. Coach Taylor at half-time, "We"re done!" "We're beat up, we can play anymore." I can't believe it. Hey, guys. You're waiting on me. You're backing up. Let's go. We missed you at the game Friday night, Buddy. Yeah, I had to listen to it on the radio. I was really sick, it was terrible. Anything you feel like sharing with us, Buddy? Anything about a certain mailbox or an old friend of yours named Eric Taylor? I don't think so. I don't know what you're implying. I think this Luke deal has made everybody go a little crazy. You know, Joe, I was a Panther before everybody here. So, I'll pretend you didn't say that. Go ahead with the agenda. Alright then. Gentlemen, there is a 13-year old quarterback in a Pop Warner League down in Little Tree that needs a closer look at. Who's gonna go down there? Lions in the house. Let me hear you say, "Oh yeah!" - What is that dude so happy about? - I don't know what he is happy about. I guess he thinks he gonna come out here and kick our asses. - Something, man. - He's all, I'm a Panther. Let's go! Execute! You're a long way from home, boy. I guess so. Come on, get after him. Pick him up. Come on, Vince. What are you doing? You're dancing out here. Dancing. Don't start my day off like this. Why is it I'm always talking to you? I spend half my day and my practice, out here, talking to you. Get in the front. Do it again. Get in the front. Let me see it. Luke, come here. - I want you at the defensive backs. - I don't play D, coach. If I tell you to get down to the defensive backs, you do. Get on the defensive backs. Tim, you wanna take him down? If you'd like to hurry that up, that'd be just fine. It's a pleasure, man. Do it again. Let me see it again. Get after him! Move him! Come on, let me see some of the speed! How you doing? I mean, I'm alright, that's just I don't play DB. It's alright. What are you doing here? Coaching now? - I'm helping out when I can. - Nice. I saw you win State. There you go. DB it up. "His last installment at the Austin Museum of Modern Art "is nothing short of mind bending. "A violent fusion of metal and artistry that invokes somehow "both anger and beauty through a complex interplay of architecture and light. "Brilliant, visceral, and ultimately, ethereal, "this work is not to be missed." - You got the right Richard Sherman? - Yep, it's him. "Brilliant and ethereal"? - It's what it says. - The dude is an angry, abusive idiot. I don't understand how he can get described as ethereal. I don't know. Maybe it's his evil twin. Yeah, maybe. Clearwater and back. This is going to be 400 miles of hell. Hey, coach. Hey, Doug, how you doing? I'm good. Nicely done. - How is everything? - Good, good. The uniforms look great, they're coming along, look beautiful. You're gonna be real happy. Look, I know... I know I'm late on payment and all this but... I know things are rough here right now. It's just if we're gonna deliver on Friday... Well, I understand. We've had a few little hiccups with our fundraising. - Sure. - And... Look, Coach, you've been a friend of Under Armor for a long while and... that's why we're doing this at our cost and I'm gonna throw in some... hats and polos for your staff, 'cause you helped me out when I was starting off. So I won't forget that. I appreciate that, I appreciate the... But I'm gonna need a little something - to take back to Baltimore. - Sure, I understand. How much? How much is it that you need today? Five. Five thousand? Alright... You give me three now and two more on delivery and we'll let it go with that. Alright. That's good, thank you. Listen, I appreciate that very much. I appreciate your understanding. - Is this a personal check, Coach? - Yes, it is. This gonna be okay with you? If it's okay with you, it is with me. - Alright. I'll get it going. - Thank you very much. Alrighty. Julie the other day was talking about how she doesn't want to go to church anymore. Like she's questioning her faith or something. You know what? She's a teenager. You give her a week and she'll turn around. Be a hundred and eighty degrees. But who knows where she'll go from there. I don't think she's going to hell anytime soon so don't worry about it. I gotta go meet with Buddy. I'm gonna try to figure out how in the hell you're supposed to... - beg money from the Boosters. - I hate that. Alright. Hey, listen. Did you write a check... and not put it in the book? Because there's a check missing. Yeah, it's for Reds. It's for the Dry Cleaners. It's for $45. - Sorry. - You've got to put that in the book. I can't keep track. - I'm here. - Come on, let's go. - We got 200 miles to cover. - We're taking my car? - I hope you're paying for gas. - I'm teaching you the meaning of life - and I'm supposed to cover for gas too? - Meaning of life... Maybe I should get you a lunch and how about a damn souvenir? I'm just saying this is a non-paying internship, okay? - Smells like old pizza in here, man. - Well, that's how I pay for gas. I'm glad you're masking it with cigarette smoke. - That's cool. - Let's roll. - Yes, sir? - Come here. Yeah, coach? I want you on special teams today working on punting. - Yeah. I'd love to catch some punts. - Good. I don't want you catching. I want you to work on the punting. You want me, like, kicking the ball? I don't know if I've ever... That's what you do when you punt the ball. - I understand. I know what it is. - Special teams punting. - Can you do that for me? - Yes. I'm only considering myself... a hands man. I need a punter. So if you would consider hang times and couffin corners, I'd appreciate that. - Thank you very much. - I'll go start practicing right now. Thank you, coach. - Coach, can I have a word please? - Sure. Come on in. I think we got off on the wrong foot and I wanted to clear everything out. I just wanna say... I don't hold anything against you for the thing between me and your wife. And... I'm not here to give you a hard time but to play football. Good, I'm glad. 'Coz I don't think you should be. As far as my wife's concerned, she was not the one who caused these problems. You caused these problems for yourself, isn't it? You were doing something knowingly wrong and you got caught, yeah? That lands yourself responsible so take that responsibility. As far as the rest, we'll see what you got when you're out there. Thanks, coach. You see stuff like this, okay? Get that, too. All right. When you're looking at all this rusty, metal stuff, it's all dirty... do you see something in it? Do I see something in it? I mean, like something, for your art. I see the face of God. - Right. - I don't know, man! I don't know. You ask too many damn questions. Questions. - It was one question. - Gonna take a little break. Not you, but... let's get the rest in there. Yeah. I had to borrow your bathroom, 'coz mine's not working. I talked to your mom about it. She said it's cool, so... Okay, I don't care. Hey, which one do you like better? The red one? Or the pink one? - For what? - I have a pageant coming up and these are kinda old but I don't think they're too short. What do you think? I don't think I'm qualified. I think it's best to ask your mom for this. She's not here, and it's just a dress. Which one do you prefer? - Where's your mom? - She's working. Every night? She can't help out with this ever? Yeah. It's not a big deal. - I can try it on if that's easier? - What? - I can try them on for you. - I don't know. - I don't think I... - Wait, which one? You're good. Pink for sure! Get the pink. You'll win with that. Good luck. Alright, so how about I just throw my last two pucks and we take off? Why? I got stuff to do. I got people to take care of. We're doing anything here. - We're just playing shuffleboard. - Alright, let's talk then. - You want to talk now? - I can talk. I'm not a dick all the time. - So talk. Talk. - Okay. Fine. What would you say is the most important tool for an artist to have? - What's with you and these questions? - You just told me to talk. I meant, you know, talk about yourself while I'm secretly mocking you in my head. You know what? How about I settle up our tab and then we'll take off. Watch out. The most important tool an artist can have is selfishness. - Selfishness? - Yeah. It means you're gonna spend your life trying to express some quiet dark corner, deep, deep inside you. You will put aside love, God, life... in order to follow this craving. So my advice to you is to just screw everybody else and maybe you got a chance. I wrote a personal check. I've got to get that money together and quick. I don't know how to talk to boosters. You do. I don't know how to ask for money. You're great at asking for money. All I'm doing is asking your help. I know and I'd like to Eric but I got Joe McCoy and thoses guys breathing down my neck. They think I'm the one who told you about the mailbox. - You are the one who told me. - I know, but I've got to unknow that right now. They may be having me followed. They probably got my phone tapped or maybe bugged. You know the guys, - they're crazy, man! - A little crazy, but let me tell you. Levi, now, Principal Burnwell has informed me he's willing to shut down the football at the school, if need be. That's what I'm up against. I'm asking you for your help. That's terrible. And I'm sorry to say this but I cannot help you right now. I just can't. - You know what? - What? You need to polish that ring of yours. It's looking a bit tarnished. An earthquake in West Texas? Yeah. They have 'em. Odessa? Odessa's on the permian basin and that's a fault line, honey. They have 'em. What would you do? Would you pray? I'd probably check on you and Gracie and Dad and then I'd stand under a doorway. Alright, I hear you. That's great. It's all good but would you pray? How about... next time... there's an earthquake in West Texas I'll let you know? Come on, now! Way to bring the wood, Cafferty! Bring that wood! All right! Come on! Hey, Vince, what are you doing, man? You've got to make that play. You've gotta catch that ball. How can you miss that? You're not gonna make that play today, how are you gonna make it Friday? Look at me. You can't make that play, what are you out here for? Hey guys, let's bring it in! Good job. What am I, the Invisible Man out here? Did you see that? It's like he's not even seeing me work my butt off out there. - What do you mean? - Coach didn't even look at me. He's got a lot on his plate, that's why. Keep doing what you're doing though. Thank you for noticing. I'll see ya later. Who's that? I'm renting a room from her mom, that's it. - You're what? - I'm renting a room from her mom. Wish I was renting a room from her mom. Just joking. Look man. You make sure he know the difference between coach and dad. He's always yelling at me, you know, on the field. Telling me what to do. Pushing me. Grabbing my jersey. He embarrass me in front of everyone. That's not how I get down, dude. That white boy sucks. Why's he all up in my face? Coming up where I hang out, at my house, talking to my moms. And you already know my mom's situation. You know how I feel about that. It's alright though, it's cool 'coz he's bringing that white boy Luke. He think he gonna take over. He's supposed to be a Panther's star. That's my spot. That's my team. I'm the Running Back. Look man! At the end of the day, white man gonna stick with the white. They're gonna look out for each other. That's what we gotta do. We gotta look out for us, alright? 25 more. Hey, Riggins, why don't you wear your Panthers state ring? I don't know. That's a good question. I guess I don't like rings. What was it like, going to State and winning that ring? It's pretty good, man. You gotta give this team a chance. Dude, be serious. This team is not the Dillon Panthers. The Coach doesn't like me. He's been pretty clear on the field. In practice, sticking me on D, no disrespect, that's not what I do. He's mad about his wife getting all backlash for throwing me off the Panthers. I want to play football, man. I want a State ring. Like I said, give it a chance, trust the coach. - What? - How're you? - Good, what's up? - Where you going? Drum up some business from local leaders in the form of cash. What do you need? As you know I've been working with Luke, a lot. And he's good. Damn good. And I think he's worth getting a tougher look at. - What's that supposed to mean? - He thinks you hate him is what I'm trying to say. I don't have the time or resources for sensitivity training. He's got to get rid of the concept that we're gonna kiss his ass 24/7 'coz he's gracing us with his presence. Tell him to shut up and work him hard. - I'll deal with the rest later. Thanks. - Yes, sir. Can we play? I mean, I was supposed to be... working on my punting but if you all want to play afterwards - or if you want to watch... - Yeah! Let's do it! You suck! That's nice. - I'm sorry. - The ball's supposed to go straight. See that was actually all planned... Want some pointers? Do you know a lot about punting? Yeah, actually I do. Here look, you wanna... Okay, I can show you 3 steps, alright? You wanna make sure that you keep that lean forward position so keep your head down. Make sure that you hit the middle of the ball with this part of your foot, okay? So point your toes, okay? And make sure you follow through all the way with your leg. But don't be stiff. Like, loosen up, okay? - But don't think! - Okay. - Well, that was better. - That was good. I'm good, right? Yeah, I'm good. I don't think that's ever gonna happen again. Yeah, it will... Especially not whenever all the thousands of screaming fans are around. - What fans? - I mean, one away game or something... - Can you all go get the balls? - Let's go! My little men... You just gotta keep doing it, okay? Over and over. Do it thousands of times 'coz you'll get that muscle memory. Just forget about the... you know, the guys, the big guys charging at you, the fans, the chaos... Just like zone in, zone in inside yourself and forget it all. Let all chaos just go... Just let it go... Let it go, you know? Where'd you learn so much about football? My... my father. He used to play football, he was a quarterback. He almost went pro, too, but now he can't stand it. Thinks it's a big waste of time. Where'd you learn so much about the... Did you study Buddhism? No, no, no, I just... It's my life, you know? How'd it go trying to get the Boosters together and all that what not? I went to about twelve of the local businesses and found out that they either don't know there's a football team, or they could give a damn less. Sorry about that. Yeah... And I stopped over at the bar and I had a drink and I left the car over there and Alan gave me a ride home. So if you could take me to get it, I'd appreciate it. Okay. You know yesterday, you asked me about the check for the Dry Cleaners? It wasn't for the Dry Cleaners. It wasn't for $45 dollars. It was for Under Armor. It was for gear for the team and it was for $3,000. You wrote a check for $3,000? - We don't have $3,000 in our account! - I know that. But when I wrote the check... It's not gonna be run through right away so you don't have to worry about it. I would have appreciated if you had talked to me. I didn't have time to. - You didn't have time to talk about it? - No, I didn't. I'm telling you about it now. Listen, I know you're having a hard time, but come on now. Why would you not talk to me about that? They said if I don't write the check, I don't have uniforms. Without team, I don't make money anyway, so what the hell does it matter? If I can get the money from Burnwell who I've been talking to, which I think I can do, everything will be fine. It's just a matter of doing it. I just need time. - I'm just telling you for the sake... - Don't raise your voice. I'm not raising my voice. Why don't you just stay calm and stop getting all riled up? You'll get your damn uniforms, but in the meantime, what about our accounts? You write yourself a check for $3,000 without talking to me about it, you lie to me about it, we don't have that money and then you come in here and yell at me? I don't think so. Hey, Luke! Your football coach is here. He's got work to do before school. - I won't take much time at all. - I appreciate it. Morning, Coach. - I'm alright. And you? - Good. - Why are you here? - I understand you're not happy at practice. Wanna talk? No disrespect, Coach, I just feel like I'm not being used. You're not giving me a chance out there. What do you want from me? First of all, I haven't gotten a chance to play offense, which is what I do. You'll get your chance. You'll get it when I give it to you. I'm trying to put a team together. I got 18 other players I'm trying to pay attention to. I can't put you up on a pedestal and pay all the attention to you. I want to get out of here, alright? That's why I'm playing football. I mean, this is it for me. This is all I care about. All I ever cared about. My parents don't help me out with this, they don't care. I was on my fast track, got to Dillon Panthers and I'm not there anymore. But here I am, willing to kill myself 'coz I want to get out of here. I just want a chance to play ball. I want a chance to get noticed. I understand... that you're helluva player. You can run circles around all the people out there. I understand everything you've been through. I understand what it's like to wanna be a Panther. Believe me, that's not lost on me. Anything else that you need? What I need? I need a scholarship to a good school so I can get out of here. Listen, I'll tell you what. I will do everything in my power to get you just that, if you do one thing for me. What? I need you to lead. Alright. Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yeah. - Lead... Alright, thank you. - Want a slap on the back? You earn it. - Alright. - See you out there this afternoon. - Alright, see you out there. Thanks for the ride. Yeah. You got a boyfriend? No, why? That's the guy that should be doing all this, giving you rides everywhere. Since you're already doing it, you'd be more efficient if you were. I'm just kidding. Have you ever run into that new Cafferty kid? - Luke? - Yeah, Luke. He likes you. I've been working with him on the field and everything and... he doesn't stop talking about you, so... And? I'm just giving you a heads up, just in case you want a boyfriend. He's a pretty good guy. I'll talk to him. Good. I just thought I'd swing by on my way home from work. I'm sorry. I appreciate that. Doug called from Under Armor. He said he's willing to wait for the school to pay for the 2,000 and the other 3,000, he's gonna take it easy on me. And I will get it paid. OK. Honey, don't ever do that again. I won't. And I'm sorry you're having such a hard time. Sounds like Coach is gonna be moving up Sobel - to take Luke's spot, tonight. - Yeah, meanwhile, Luke Cafferty is on his way of being massacred in his first Lions game. What a waste. One good thing is gonna come out of this, tough. McCoy is gunning for Principal Taylor. What are you talking about, Lester? McCoy'll figure a way to get that bitch out of there. - There you go. - I can't even believe you, Moore. I got something to say to everybody. I hate to... spoil the party, but... This is to everybody. You know what? I'm not a Panther anymore. You used to be my friends, I don't know who you are. I don't know what you believe in, but it's not the Panthers. It's not the Panthers I believed in, it's not the Panthers we grew up with. I'll tell you that right now, you wanna know another thing? I'm the one who told Eric about the mailbox. I can't live with myself anymore, I put that mailbox in, 12 years ago. In the middle of the night, I dug that hole and put it in. It's my mailbox, I can do whatever I want to with it. And Joe... I tried, but ever since you got here, you've been a cancer to me, you've been a cancer to my friends and you've been a cancer to this team. And just one more thing I wanna say. It's clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose. - I just gotta drop this off real quick. - Yeah, no problem, take your time. Who the hell are you, little girl? Hi, I'm Julie. Matt's girlfriend. He went inside to drop off that tool you asked him to pick up. So you're the ball and chain that keep dragging him down. I think I married you about 20 years ago, babe. Thought we'll get new uniforms. What are we doing, playing in our practice stuff? Tinker, why don't you do less talking and more thinking about the game, son? Let's go. Let's go, gentlemen. Let's go! Look at this! Alright! Oh, these are official right here. Hey, listen up! Listen up, gentlemen. Listen up! They may be new... but they're still work clothes. Let's go to work! All of a sudden, he was talking to me. That's the first time I have a real conversation with him. He's actually a really smart guy. He had real interesting things to say, it was crazy. Do you think I'm holding you back? No. Why? I was outside waiting for you... and Richard Sherman came out and started talking to me. About what? He said I was the ball and chain holding you back. That's stupid. You're the most important thing in my life. What if that's the point? No, that's not the point. The point is that he's stupid, that he was drunk. He don't know about us. Eat your bean curd. - Alright. - Alright. Lions down, 27-0 late in the fourth. They are definitely gonna finish this one, folks.</i> Cafferty on the Bronco blitz. He hits him in the backfield!</i> Luke Cafferty has been bringing it all night!</i> Nice hit, Luke!

Vince, what was that? - What was that? - I didn't have an angle! What do you mean, didn't have an angle? You could've run circles around him! - Don't waste no energy, Coach! - Let me tell you something! You know why I always pick on you? 'Coz you're good, that's why. You know why you have a problem? 'Coz you're your own worst damn enemy! - Fine! Get out of my face! - No! You get out of my face and let me tell you something: put that damn helmet right now. Don't you dare talk to me like that. You change it right now. Or you will be out of this game so damn fast you will never... - Yes, sir! - Understood? - Landry! - Yes, Coach. - Get out there. Get us a field goal. - Field goal!

This could be it folks! Oh my, touchdown! Touchdown, East Dillon! Vince Howard has scored. Coach Taylor and the East Dillon Lions are on the board.</i> Touchdown, hallelujah! Alright, Lions!

And I like having you sit next to me, at least for a little bit longer. And I think it's good that you're questioning your faith. I just want you to have faith in something.

Alright, screw you, too. What are you doing? I'm just looking at this thing. That's a piece of crap. That's a beautiful piece of crap. Thank you. I'll get the money together somehow. - I know you will. - I love you. I love you, too. And you know what? Now that you've gotten all the way through the game,
