No, Tami, we don't need one, but we want one. I told Buddy Garrity I'm gonna reallocate the Jumbo Tron funds to academics. Miss Colette, states schools are a pipe-dream. I mean, do you really want it like... - the whole boyfriend-girlfriend thing? - Yes. I lost my scholarship, and no school wants me. I will help you getting into college and playing football again. I won't stop until you get there. Oh, my God. - Just take it off. - I'm trying. Seriously, it's a new butt warmer, - it's already... - Get it off! What the hell is this? I'm digging through the couch looking for change and find this. Were you gonna tell me about it? - Letter of interest from Oklahoma, man. - What? Wait a minute, let me see that. Tim, this is great. You didn't tell me you were getting interest from colleges. But you're gonna respond to this, right? - This is about the rest of you life. - Exactly, the rest of your life. I'm gonna go get my laptop and write a response. You and me, man, we're going places. Listen, I want the scoreboard too and I don't believe we'll get it. I just think that this reallocation of these funds is actually gonna be a win for everybody involved. But still, the people of Dillon, they love their football. Well, you know, I know that, I mean... That's been my life here for so many years. And I see how great that program is... Let's spread that around. Get the academics on the same par. Tell the truth, though, there must have been a little tension between you and your husband over this? You know, I feel like we both approached our marriage and our career with a real... Real foundation of respects, so... 160/100. Lorraine... We're in the danger zone. Are you taking your medication? I don't like those pills. - But I like that tie. - Well, thank you very much. Matthew, did we turn off the stove, honey? Yeah, the stove is off. Wait Grandma, you need... - Why aren't you taking your pills? - They dry out my skin. And you know as well as anyobdy, I have always looked young for my age. Lorraine, can I just speak the man outside just for a sec? Matthew, I'm not even gonna refill these. This is a big problem, Matt. Look, how about you just give me the pills... and then I'll make sure she takes it. I can put it in her food or something. I can't legally do that. Okay, so we're supposed to just... wait for her to have a stroke? Listen, we knew this day would come. It comes for every patient with dementia. She's no longer able to handle her own affairs. I'm sorry, Matt. What are you doing? Waiting for the new edition of the paper. It's got  my article on it. You're not supposed to read your own press. I know. I'll make seconds to have it. You get articles all the times. Here it is, I think. I'll get more wine. 3x02: TAMI KNOWS BEST Subtitles: Team Panthers With the participation of: benj!, charliea, DarKsh, GillesSilb, Ju, loky34, ouazo, tactactac, Teardrop Come on, make the cut. Hey, come here. Every time you go left, you loose half the speed. What's that all about? - It's nothing. - Is it your leg? You're in pain? - You tell me if you're in pain. - I'm not in pain, Coach. The knee is fine, I'm just getting used to it. Anyway... I gotta get to work. So do you, by the way. Hey, Coach. You don't mind me asking. What's the big plan, anyway? Don't worry about it. You keep working on your speed, I'll work on the try-outs. I got a lot of calls out there... Gonna be a lot of calls coming in soon, we're gonna have to choose. So just get yourself ready. I'll take care of that. You take care of the rest. Smash, he was on the hot list last year. Your call, buddy, time's on. Yeah, no, his knee is fine, that's what I'm saying, you gotta see this kid, he's got Texas Tech written all over him. Well, no, I understand that the timing is not exactly perfect right now. All right. All right, well, thanks for returning the call. No luck with Smash? Well, it's not exactly the... right time for setting up a walk on that, is it? - Morning, everybody. - Principal Taylor? - Yes, Clant. - Here you go. - Phones are ringing off the hook. - Really, what about? Jumbo Tron? Well, tell 'em I said you're welcome. Thank you. - Mayor Rodell. - Good morning, Tami. - Hi. How are you? - Morning. - This is a great picture. - Thank you so much. So, to what do I owe this great... unexpected surprise? Honey, you know why we're here for. It's about that scoreboard situation. You're new. You're excited. I appreciate that. I really do. But what has happened to you, is that you've made a mistake. And that's okay. That's okay. Lord knows I've been there myself in front of the whole town. But the thing to do now is to admit you made that mistake and fix it. Well, the thing is... I haven't made a mistake, Mayor Rodell. Really? Is that what you think? Then you're not looking at the big picture. Because those boosters raised that money in good faith that it was gonna be used for a scoreboard. And it is not up to you to make some unilateral decision to spend it any other way. I don't give a damn what it's for! Well, actually, technically, it is up to me according to the bylaws, but what I find interesting is given the funding problems in this school, given the test scores of this school, I am surprised that you and all those boosters have not jumped right on this bandwagon, that's what surprises me. I am really sorry to hear that you feel that way, Tami. I really am. I just... I hope it doesn't turn ugly. For your sake, I mean. Damn, we are splurging tonight, baby. I got New York strips. Pan fried and buttered, the way that got it tender. It's about $40 worth of prime beef here, baby. And I wanted to talk to you about Saturday. Joe McCoy wants us to... go out to eat. Is that okay? Yeah, sure. I'll see if Tim can come. You know, Lyla, I don't know if... Tim Riggins is really the right one for you. Well, he's a good guy. He's going to college. Tim Riggins going to college is like me teaching yoga classes. That's not gonna happen. Maybe he just needs someone to believe in him. You ever think about that? There's been plenty of young girls in Dillon who have believed in him. Do you understand that a dad would not want his daugther to be with a guy who drinks all the time and has been with half the girls in the state of Texas? He comes with wild trash. He's gonna bring you down. Are you using protection? Excuse me? The last thing we need is for you to get pregnant and for us to have to raise Tim Riggins' kid. Lyla! That craziness in my office today with Buddy and the mayor. It was unbelievable. They were threatening me. It was like the mafia. And I thought the mayor would be on my side, I mean... And there's Buddy just sitting there, like... none of this is his fault, he doesn't know what's going on. These people are acting like I've done the worst thing in the world. Like it's terrible for everybody. What is everybody thinking? What do you think I should do? I'll get her. - Honey. - I got it, go to bed. Hey, I'm Tyra Colette, vote for me. Vote for Tyra. Okay, so hand me about half these flyers and I'm gonna hang some out in the quad. You're gonna be wonderful. That's not that funny. - Vote for Tyra! - It's not that funny... There are not one person who saw who did this? - Nobody saw who did this? - What's going on? Oh, nothing, it's just a little situation here. I'm gonna handle it. Don't worry about it. - It's fine, I'll handle it. - Landry! Okay, all right. Just go to class. Tyra, I'm sorry this happened, but I'm not sure what you want me to do. I got into this race late. I need to get my face out there. I can't do it like that. I do know this. Jenny Warwick started working on her campaign 3 weeks ago, not the night before deadline. You can't get into the race late, and half fast, and expect people to respect you. Either she's completely in charge of herself or she's non-<i>compos mentis</i>. - I don't know what that means. - A legal term for when you lose it. That's why I'm suggesting you become her guardian. No, I don't want to become her guardian. She's my guardian, okay? I'm 17. You could become an emancipated minor, then you could assume legal guardianship over your grandmother's affairs. That way, you'd have complete control over her financial matters... I don't wanna be in control of all that, okay? I'm trying to go to college next year. What about your dad? He's in Iraq, right? Is he coming home anytime soon? I don't know... I don't think so. Well, I suppose we could put her in a home. Let State take care of her. I'm not doing that. Listen, hey... I'm just giving you your options. You know, you came in here and... it seemed pretty urgent. Here is the paperwork to become... an emancipated minor. If you decide to do it, you can track down your dad and have him sign. Come on, let's go! Oh, come on, man! You got a big game tomorrow! Just whacked you up. Hey, guys! I got a little kid home who'd like to see me today! That's it! Damn, Rig, what the hell, man? What did you hit me for? - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. I pushed you Williams, you gotta relax, man! You know what? Just forget it! I don't even know what we're doing out here, anyway! What do you do? Where are you going? All right, grandma. I really... Look, we're gonna just... We gonna try taking these pills, okay? I know you don't want to, but... I can't take that. It makes my face look like mummies or so. Well, you know what a stroke will make your face look like? I'm not gonna have a stroke. I don't even know anybody who's had a stroke. Grandma, if you don't take these pills... You leave me alone about the pills. I'll be right back. Sorry... You... You work here now? Yeah, I work at Applebee's... God, you got a name tag and everything, uh? Yeah, I'm very official. I'm just saving it for a car. So... why are you kicking the crap out of the boxes? It's my grandma. She refuses to take her blood pressure medication. Why isn't she taking it? Because she thinks that if she takes it, it's going to dry her skin out and make her look like a mummy. And the doctor can't legally give me her medication to... you know, to give to her because I'm not her legal guardian. And I can't be her legal guardian unless I become an emancipated minor, and in order to become an emancipated minor, I'd have to have my dad sign... some piece of paper but unfortunately, my dad's in Iraq right now, he's not sitting around by a fax, so I can't get him to sign anything. So... Would now be a bad time to tell you your grandma is yelling at the cooks - to make her chocolate pudding. - Are you serious? No, no! No, I'm just... I'm joking. I'm sorry, I was trying to be funny. That was rude. Yes, it was. But it was kind of funny. Yeah, well... I gotta get back to work. - It was good seeing you. - You too. Would you mind, like, kind of piling the boxes back where you found them? Thank you. Oh, yeah... Take it off... Take it off, come on. Lyla, I know how to dress myself. No, you only know how to put on a pledge shirt one button per button. You know what'd be great? We just leave, cause I don't even wanna go to this dinner in the first place. Yeah, well, if you only did what you wanted to do, your life would be all about football, beer and sex, wouldn't it? And what's the problem with that? It's just a good opportunity for you to spend some time with my dad. And Mr. McCoy went to Oklahoma, so he... - might be able to help you out. - Basically, you want me to smooth him. No, I don't want you to smooth anybody. I just... You guys just gonna, you know, talk about football. - Not a big deal. - I hate this, and I don't wanna go. You don't even know what you're saying you hate. You just gonna go to dinner with a guy who loves football, who... might actually be able to help you out and there's nothing more to it. Come on... You... wanna tell me the real reason why we're doing this? Because... I care about you. And you wanna know why <i>I'm</i> doing this? Because you care about me? Maybe just a bit. Thank you. How about... "A vote for Tyra is a vote for hotness?" Landry, I'm serious here. I'm trying to be a serious person. How is that not serious? I'm trying to help you out. How about "Vote Tyra... - "and get action?" - Hell, yeah! - I didn't realize it was gonna sound... - How about nothing about action or hotness? Well, why not, honey? You're such a gorgeous girl. I mean, I always say "smoke him if you got him", that's all! Seriously, all right, back off! Knock it off! I want you all off the campus in one minute or I'm calling the police. - That's a little extreme, Mr. Trucks... - The party's over, ladies. What's going on? Jenny's mom was here yesterday helping her to hand out cupcakes, I don't understand why I can't have some friends helping me. - Mrs. Colette, are you really that dumb? - Hey, watch it. Just give me a moment here, Mrs. Taylor. Do I have to explain to you the difference between Jenny's mom and 4 dancers from the <i>Landing Strip</i>? Back to class right now. Right now, you all! Did you hear what Mrs. Taylor said? Clear out! What are you doing? - I'm helping my campaign. - You are suspended - 3 days, starting now. - Wait a minute... - Wait, no! - Hold on, hold on. Listen, I'm... Let me deal with this, all right? - You gonna deal with it? - Yes, I'm taking care of it. Tyra... Go get ready for that meeting and I'm gonna discuss this with you later. Thanks, Mrs. T. You're letting her get away with this? You have got to be kidding me. I need two more burgers well done with Alamo sauce. After that, I need you to mob the floor in the back, I ain't staying late tonight. Yeah, fine. Hey, Coach, what's the matter? Give you a crispy chicken sandwich for the game? I've been calling every school I can think of telling them that Smash Williams is on a full recovery, that he's ready to play college ball. You tell me, should I not be doing that? I don't know what it is. I've never been scared once playing football. Even after Jason Street, I just... I played like nothing could touch me. Look, it's not just the knee... I mean, it is, but... I know you think I can be who I was. But I think I was only great cause I was a Dillon Panther. I was part of something bigger than myself. The team needed me to be great, so... I was great. Now, I'm just a guy playing by myself on my old high school field. And let's be honest... you're having a hard time finding a try-out for me. I'll get you a try-out. Suck it up. That's what being a man is. I wanna see you over Hermann Field at 8 o'clock, Saturday night, full pants. Don't you be late on me. And I'd also like to remind everyone that with two years student government experience under my belt, I understand what is required and I'm ready to lead. This is a question for Tyra. Can you explain for those of us who are concerned about your lack of experience, how you could turn this into a positive when acting as a liaison between the students and the faculty? Wow, that was a long question. I don't think I remember half of it. No, seriously, y'all. What this entire election really boils down to is who you want planning your prom, and one thing I can tell you is that nobody here is getting laid if you let Jenny here have our prom in the gym, okay? Wow, oh my... Is this a Panther's cakewalk or what?</i> The Panthers hold the commanding lead,</i> 42 to 0 over the Laribee Lions. And how about a little icing for that cake?</i> Saracen's under the center. He takes the snap. He screens right to Riggins in the midfield.</i> He's to the forty, he's got room! He picks up a good block for forty to the tenth!</i> Touchdown, Tim Riggins! Oh, boy, the Panthers have this one in hands.</i> Coach, good game. Good game. Craig, how you doing? Good to see you. When are we gonna see that J.D. McCoy kid play? - Matt had a hell of a game. - Yeah. I hear what you're saying. All right, good nap, enjoy tonight. He didn't even acknowledge me. And Karen O'Day is not making eye contact with me, it's like all these people hate my guts, what's wrong on with them? It's craziness. People love football, you're not gonna change that. I know that and I also know they're not thrilled about the loss of their big Jumbo Tron. - Did they change this menu? - You know what, hon? I need you to weigh in, cause at this point, I'm feeling like this world's against me and I'm wondering which side you're on. Honey, I don't wanna weigh in on this situation right now, because I don't wanna tell my wife who I love and who I believe in, a hundred percent, that the first major decision that she made at that school, could be construed by some... as questionable. It's risky, yeah, I mean... And courageous. Questionable? Come on, Hon... You know what? I don't care about the damn Jumbo Tron. I really don't. But let me tell you something, Buddy Garrity and the boosters, if they want that damn Jumbo Tron, they are gonna get that damn Jumbo Tron. And the hell with the rest of them, - but you knew that from the get-go. - Well, yes. The only people who have the money are the boosters and Buddy Garrity, and I love they want the football program to flourish but I just think that they need to be told if they want that to flourish, they need to give a tiny, tiny bit to academics. Baby, there is a big difference between tiny, tiny and Jumbo Tron. This is the way change is made and I felt like I needed to make that statement right from the beginning. Honey, you made it clear, and you made your statement. Well, I know... there is a new episode of <i>Cagney and Lacy</i> on. There's not any new ones on, this show is not on anymore. That was a good show, I don't know why they quit those good shows and put these other shows on. All right... I'll watch whatever this is. - Is that milk about ready, honey? - Yeah, this is ready, it's on its way. Oh, thanks. I saw that game. You played great. You just played great. - Thanks. - You've always loved football, Matty. I remember when you were 2, you were trying to throw a football bigger than you were. And you were such a sweet baby. Such a sweet, sweet baby. But here you are, all grown-up... taking care of everything. I don't know what I'd do without you. I don't know. Matthew, I love you. I know, I love you too, grandma. Grandma... You are such a good boy. That's cause I was raised by you. Thank you... Thank you. Okay, okay... Can I help you with something, Matt? I need to borrow your car. Why do you need to borrow my car, Matt? Okay, look. I just borrow it, and it'll be back in the morning, You don't even have to know that it was gone. Please. It's me, Matt. Your son. Matt? - Look at you. - Look. I just need you... to sign these papers, please. What's this? I need to become an emancipated minor so I can take care of grandma legally. Lorraine? Where's Henry? He's in Iraq. I don't wanna talk about all the things, so if you could just sign those, please. - You wanna come inside? - No. Okay. Hang on a second. - What are you doing? - It's just... I can't... I'm not gonna sign anything that I haven't read, so... What's wrong with Lorraine? She's got dementia. She can't really take care of herself anymore. And Henry left you alone with her? I don't think you really are in position to judge. You got a pen? Yeah. Come in. Did you hear? You are looking at the new president of the Dillon High student body. - I heard. - And they said it couldn't be done. Can I help you with something? What's the matter? You know you sank to the lowest comment and nominator to win that election. No, I... Mr. Trucks, he made it... Don't you even go blame it on Mr. Trucks! It is time for you to start taking responsibility for your life. Well, Mrs. T., I was just doing what I though I had to. And when I was standing out there in that quad watching you make an idiot out of yourself and everybody around you, I did what I thought I had to do by sticking up for you. Because I have believed in you. Now, I suggest you would better start earning back your self-respect and the faith that I once had in you, or you really will be on your own. Go and get to class. - You're ready ? - Oh yeah! All right. Bring it back. - 26 to count. - All right, you all heard the man. On one. Ready? - You all right? - Lucky hit, Rig. - Lucky. - All right. - How you doin'? - I'm good. Same play. Set. Hut! Smash, you okay, man? I didn't mean to hit the knee. You okay? Smash, get up, baby. Hey, 6! I'm back, baby! - The Smash is back! - There you are, man. - I'm sure it'll be fine. - Yeah, you gonna be fine. I'll just chat him up about playing with Bosworth at Oklahoma, and then... How the hell do you know that? Google, why? I didn't know you google. - I'm not retarded, I google. - I know, but... Sometimes, you pretend you are, so... Oh, my God! Buddy Garrity, look at your dau... You are just a vision! And you, are you sure she's yours? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - This is Tim. - How are you? - Nice to meet you. - Joe McCoy, good to see you. - What up, man, how is it going? - Good. - So, Melany, we all here. - Right this way. Two things. I don't like you with my daughter, the reason should be obvious. Two, my relationship with Joe McCoy is extremely important. You do not jeopardize it in any way, or I will hurt you. Joe, that is nice. Thank you. That's my anniversary present. That's beautiful. Yeah, that was a bargain. Tim, I understand that you have switched positions this year to tailback? How is that working out for you? Thinking about college for next year? - Are we ready to order? - Sure. - The Texas Game Sampler, please. - Texas Game Sampler. - And you, Ma'am? - I'll have the same, please. - And for you, sir? - You still have the porterhouse? But it's not on menu. That's what I want. I want that big porterhouse, just have Wayne cut me one. - Medium rare. - Yes, sir. And for you, sir? All look so good. Let's go with the... Let's go with the squab, tonight. Honey, are you sure? Yes, ma'am. Okay, well then... Go. Can I get that... Let's get that rare, as well, please. One rare squab. Thank you, sir. - What happened in there? - What do you mean? Mr. and Mrs. McCoy were asking you a bunch of questions, you didn't say anything, you were rude. Did I not give you heads up that I hate those restaurants, those people, the food was sick. Yeah, well, you ordered rare pigeon. You know what? Who are you trying to turn me into, right now? I'm not trying to turn you into anything. - Are you sure about that? - I'm positive. I'm trying to make you into someone who doesn't order rare squab. I'm a horrible person. Maybe I'm just too simple of a guy for you, Lyl'. I'm too simple, I'm not classy enough for you. That's right. That's what it is. - Maybe we should just go separate ways. - Maybe we should. - Good. - Great. - Hi, Tami. - How you doin'? I'm fine. Can we talk for just a second? Yeah, as long as it's not about the Jumbo Tron thing, because I don't wanna talk about that on my time off. Well, it is about the Jumbo Tron, because... Quite frankly, Tami, just let me say this. That issue has not been put to bed, yet. We had a meeting, with the superintendent. The funds are frozen. Who had a meeting? Well, the boosters, and the mayor, and the superintendent, and all the people I've been out trying to get money from, for the Jumbo Tron. And so, anyway, the hearing will be in 2 weeks, it's open to the public, you could be there of course, everybody avows their opinion. And we'll see what we do at that time. I'm sorry it happens this way. It's gonna be okay. Bye. What's that all about? Hey, Mitch, how you doin'? - Coach Taylor. - Hey, Corina. - How you doin'? - Fine. I'm sorry to come by so late... That's okay. Come on in. Brian! - Yeah, mama? - Come here! What's up, Coach? You and I have some work to do. 2 weeks time. You got a walk on Texas A&M. Yes, sir. I'll make you proud. - See you tomorrow morning. - Yes, sir. Hey, kid. - Good night. - Thank you. Thank you, Coach! Somebody died? - Why are you here? - Mandy had to drop something off. So, as soon as they're done humping, I'm out of your hair. Well, that shouldn't take too long. You think? I've been here long enough. Why are you dressed like that? I'm dressed like this because I just came from dinner with Buddy Garrity, Lyla, and the new rich booster that I was supposed to chat up about college. Which, between you and me, don't think I'm cut out for. You and me both. But it's nice to get this off and... kinda want to have a beer, just chill out and watch... anything. Yeah, cheers. I ate pigeon tonight, Tyra. Why? - I don't know why. - I don't know what pigeon looks like. It was crap. Could barely get through, but I ate it because I didn't want them to think I'm making a mistake. - Where are your pants? - My pants are just over there... It was hot. So I just... geared down, just chilling. - I brought you a cheeseburger. - Seriously? I felt bad. Thank you. It's very sweet of you. Great. You done? - I was waiting for him to start... - You know what? Don't even... - Bye, y'all. Good seeing you. - That's a good look for you, Tim. - I love you, Billy. - I love you too, sweetie. Why are you in Landry's car? I just needed to borrow it for something. You done with work? Yeah, long day. You want a ride? Sure. I went and saw my mom. That's a big step. I got her to sign those papers, so... I'm an emancipated minor, now. Emancipated minor... That's kinda hot. - Yeah, you think? - I think it's very hot. Does that mean you get to, like... vote, and drink, and... smoke, and rent cars? It means I get to take care of old people. Yeah, maybe not so hot. Yeah, maybe not. - Stop the car. Stop, stop. - What? This is the car I'm gonna buy. What do you think? It's the car Mrs. Sadmark's gonna sell me when I make enough money working at Applebee's. She's beautiful, isn't she? This is a Celica. Are you implying that maybe I should buy a Dodge Dard and let the engine fall out, so I can be just like you? Okay, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful... Celica. See? I told you.
