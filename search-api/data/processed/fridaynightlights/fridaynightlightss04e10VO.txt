I break it down to its component parts. A chop shop. How much money we talking about? You'll make more money in two months than you could in two years. - Who's that? - That's Ryan. Is there something you wanna tell me about? I will say that I feel a lot better. Look, I've got some bad news. I'm pregnant, and it's yours. I don't know what I'm gonna do. And I'm so scared. Come here. I am filled with pride and love as I look out over this congregation. And there is our own star on the football field, Luke Cafferty. Thank you, Luke, for making your congregation so proud. Let us pray. Our father who art in Heaven... Hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done... Well, awesome. I believe this belongs to you, sir. Appreciate it again, huh? I'll see you soon. I can't take any more of these skeletons. - What do you mean? Why not? - You can guess. I ain't asked any questions about where you been getting these car frames, but I ain't real interested in the cops surprising me either. You keep showing up with these stripped cars, they're gonna show up too. All right. - Sorry. - Yeah, don't be. Thank you. Let the tight end clear. Slot receiver crosses underneath... you hold. You hit the third receiver, he's gonna be running the delay. So that third receiver's taking too long, - and the defense is in my face... - Listen! You let the tight end clear. Slot receiver crosses underneath, you hold. You hit the third receiver. He's running a delay. Can you see that? - You can see that? - I can. - You can see it? - Yes, sir. - You understand that? - I gotta go, 'cause Mr. Merriweather's not a happy man when I'm late. I want you to know this stuff sooner than later. Yes, sir. - How you doing, Coach? - I'm doing good. How are you? - How's the kid doing? - Showing up on time, doing the work. So I see you're doing a delay drag. You're gonna start putting in timing patterns. Thinking about it, yeah. Looking forward to the game. What was that supposed to mean? How you doing? Well, I woke up this morning, and I'm still pregnant, so... had better days. Kind of puts that B-minus I got in geography into perspective. Talked to your mom yet? - I don't know what I'm gonna do. - You need to talk to your mom. Why? She'll understand. You don't know her. Come on. - Where are we going? - Give me your hand. Trust me. Let's go. - Hey, Tim. How are you? - Hi, Mrs. Taylor. - Good. - Sorry, Coach isn't here right now, but he should be back in a couple hours or so. I'm actually here to talk to you. Okay. Everything all right? I need your help. - Come on in. - It's actually for a friend of mine. Have y'all talked about your options at all? - Oh, Tim's not the father. - We're just friends. Tim, I think it would be a good idea for you to wait outside for a moment, give Becky and I some privacy. Yeah. Yeah, of course. I'll be outside. Have you told your parents? No. Do you think it would put you in any kind of harm, any kind of physical or emotional harm, if you were to tell them? No. It's just me and my mom. I just haven't been able to tell her yet. Well, I think my first suggestion is gonna be for you to try to find a way to tell her as soon as you can. I think that's gonna be real important. Does the father know? Yeah, he does, but... I barely know him, and I don't love him or anything. And... It's just like this whole thing is a bad dream... - I understand. - I just keep wanting it to go away. What should I do? You have free medical assistance available to you throughout your pregnancy. There's a teen clinic. They're real helpful and knowledgeable there. I can refer you to the adoption agency. - That's local here. - What if I don't... What if I don't want to have the baby? I can direct you to literature... for that. 4x10: I CAN'T Subtitles: Team Lions With the participation of: Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb, Mpm, Ouazo Let's go now, 5. Good splits now. Come off the ball. Vince, come here. Bring it in! You're gonna want to rush this play... Don't. - Let the receivers clear. - What about the offensive line? They're not blocking. Why don't you just worry about the lanes and worry about your job... How's that? Come on, now, son. Let's go. You got this, 5. Call it. These guys got to get it together. I mean, this is... Oh, man. That boy couldn't get a bull with a ball on the field today. He get his feet under him, he'll be all right. - Big Mary. Look who's here. - Mary, Mary, quite contrary. How y'all doing? What's up, baby? - How's it going out there? - Not too good, man. Vince would be lucky to hit water from a boat today. Pre-snap protection, now. Come on! - Do it! - Give him some time. Let's go! That kid can run like the wind, brother. Not as fast as Virgil was. Nobody cut upfield like you did, boy. They're not very good, are they? What is this? I mean, I... Honestly, I bet I could sue them for false advertising. What is this? This is crap. This is not even something that should go into our bodies... I'm pregnant. That's not even funny, Becky. Why would you s... No, you're not. What... Damn it! You're kidding me, right? You're not kidding me? You're telling me right now that you're pregnant? You're not! Damn it, Becky! - Did she go down all right? - Yeah, after four books and a few stories, I had to crawl out of the room again. - That's what it takes nowadays. - She's getting smart like that. Don't slam the door. - Is Grace already asleep? - Yes, you missed her. And you missed dinner. - I was just busy. Sorry. - So busy. - Busy? You're always busy. - Busy, busy all the time. So speaking of being busy, Wednesday night when we have dinner, I invited a friend over. Oh, what kind of a friend? Do you remember that guy Ryan? - He works for Habitat... - Ryan, I remember Ryan. He's gonna come over. But I gotta go do homework, and I love you guys. - Later. - Love you. Nice talking to you. - Don't wake her up. - I won't. - How old is that kid? - I don't know, honey. That's not gonna last. I can tell you that. It's a rebound. So one thing I got to tell you, though. Tim Riggins came over here today with a girl from East Dillon high. He came over here? - What did he come over here for? - 'Cause she was pregnant. Tim Riggins is gonna be a father? I know. That's what I thought too, but, no. No, they said he's not the father. But it was his girlfriend? No, I don't think it was. I don't know. I think they were friends. It was very... it was very strange, honey. Well, wait a second. Why did he come over here? I don't know what his involvement is. I'll tell you one thing, though. She needed someone to talk to. - Did it go all right? - I think so. I did what I'm supposed to do. I told her about some of her options and told her she should talk to her parents. Hey, mom. I brought you home some barbecue... Ribs, chicken, greens, 'cause I don't eat nothing compared to you. Mom. I need an ambulance to 2609 Chavez, apartment 23. What happened? You O.D'd. You had a little bit too much. The doctor's got you sedated, and... You're gonna be just fine. You're gonna be all right. Come here. Give your mother a hug. No, don't. It's so you won't hurt yourself. Okay. Mom. Why do you keep doing this to yourself? Why do you keep doing this to me? I mean, am I that bad? Why don't you want to be with me? Why do you want to leave me by myself? Because... I don't know if I... I don't know if I can do it by myself. Baby... I can't do it by myself, mom. - Hey, how you doing? - Fine. Everything's awesome. Let me. Can we talk, please? About what? - You know what I want to talk about. - You haven't told anyone, have you? 'Cause that is seriously the last thing I need right now. I didn't. I... I haven't made the appointment yet. - So just stop hassling me. - Okay. I'm not hassling you. This is my problem, and I'm figuring it out on my own. - So you just need to forget about it. - I can't. That's what I'm trying to do. How's it going? Did you do your homework? Cool, can I copy it? So I replaced the timing belt. That was $110. I checked all the fluids. I checked all your hoses. And just threw in a free oil change... What you got going on here? What are you doing? Don't touch that! What are you doing? Chill, man. Fixing cars is delicate, man. I don't need you touching on things. Relax. He didn't even touch anything. I was looking at him the whole time. So it's $140 all together. All set. Texas law requires that I inform you of the probable gestational age of your pregnancy at the time that we plan to do the procedure. Now, you can estimate the age by counting... We get it, doctor. - All right? - I'm sorry. This is useless. You don't have to go through the whole procedural options, Blah, blah, blah. She's not having a baby. She's having an abortion. I understand. This is state mandated, Everything that I'm saying. I'm trying to save our time. There's no point in going through all the details. I don't care what the state mandates. We really don't need to hear that. After I finish, then she can decide what she wants to do. She's already decided what she wants to do. Unbelievable. I'm supposed to listen to some right-wing doctor Give me a trip, take another day off from work So he can tell us we're trash. "Oh, you got a teenage daughter who's pregnant. You must be trash too." - It's so insulting. - I'm sorry! - You don't... - I'm sorry! It's all right. It's all right. You are gonna be fine. Listen to me... You are gonna do this. And you're gonna live your life, and this is not... You're not even gonna think about it anymore, okay? You don't have to be sorry. You're gonna be fine. I promise. You're gonna be fine. Excuse me. You're in charge of the rehab programs, right? No, but I can help you with it. The nurse said I should talk to you about getting my mom into rehab? - What's her name? - Regina Howard. You're looking at a 30-day in patient program. Here, let me see. Looks like we have an opening around... the beginning of the year. But I'm pretty sure you guys, get cancellations all the time or whatnot, because my mom... She needs help now. Sorry, but the state residential centers have a really long waiting list. So there are cancellations, but you're still probably looking at around January. January. There are also private rehab centers out there. Like... This is one. They almost always have openings. - This looks pretty expensive. - Yeah. - You know what your problem is? - No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me. What is my problem? You don't know how to coach Vince. I don't know how to coach? Said you don't know how to coach Vince. How to talk to him. You're not looking at me and telling me that I can't coach Vince because he's black and I'm white? - I'm not. - So What? I might be seeing some things that you might be missing. This is one of those supremely irritating conversations that we have. Are you seeing it because you're black? I don't understand Vince because I'm black. I understand him because he's me. Do you know what it's like to be the most athletic guy and then be told, "Don't follow your instincts. "Follow the playbook, no matter what"? What am I supposed to do? What do you want? - The kid's got to learn the plays. - Of course, I'm not stupid. ... because they're black. - Would you stop it? - I know he's got talent. I'm trying to give him a skill set. You know what? You're telling me I can't coach because you don't like what I do. Can we have two more, Robin, please? I do appreciate you... callin' a cab last night. But you need to face the realities about your age, which is that you can't go drinking like that on a school night. - Where is your car? - Wait. Stop. - Where is your car? - Just stop. I'm stopped. You don't even remember what bar you were at, do you? Go around back. Good lord. You need to not feel like you got to drink everybody down under the table. - It's right there. - So it is. There it is. Right. You gonna take me to my car? You can walk. A walk will do you some good. - Are you serious? - Fresh air in your hair. - Love you. - Love you too. Hope you feel better today. Love you! - Feel better today! - See you later. We can't keep doing this. We're begging to get busted. I get it. - I'm not a moron. - The cops are gonna show up. - What do you want to do? - Figure something out. - That's what I want to do. - Yeah, I'm coming! One second. It's getting too risky. I get it. We could... We could, like, you know, - drive them off a cliff. - They have no engines, Billy. We've stripped them and sold them. Good call. I got another idea. We can take them out to the lake, just take the car frames out to the lake and just dump them in the lake. Yeah, just strap 'em on my back. I'll swim out there. We could bury 'em. We could take 'em out in the middle of nowhere and just dig a big-ass hole and just bury them. - That's a lot of work. - Yeah, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of money we're making off. It's a lot of trouble if we don't find a place for 'em. - Guess we'll bury 'em. - All right. So, Ryan, how long were you in Indonesia for? Maybe two months? First month, we just spent clearing earthquake debris, and then we started rebuilding people's houses... I mean, an amazing experience. And was all that for school credit? Started out that way, and then... I kind of wanted to take an extended leave, got hooked, and just been traveling ever since. Did you know you can travel the world working for Habitat, rebuilding houses? Yes, honey. So, coach... Julie tells me you coach football. I heard... the other day it was gonna rain on Friday. You know, how was that? How's what? I mean, it must be weird, you know? Everyone out there in the rain, playing football. You know? It's raining... - Yeah, it can get pretty weird. - Are you gonna stay in town or... I'm gonna get some more of these popovers. Actually, I'm the team leader of a new building project, so I'm gonna head to Arizona next week. That's a shame. But you know it's a beautiful place. That is beautiful there in Arizona. - Dry. - It's a desert, honey. - Very dry. - I've never been, but... - She ain't here. - Actually, I came to talk to you. Come on. Sir, I know this is gonna sound a little suspect... seeing as I just now started working for you, but... I'm gonna need an advance on my check. Why? It's nothing bad. How much? 4 grand. So what kind of trouble you in? It's not me. Between you and I? I've been trying to get my mom checked into a rehab center. Don't they have programs, you know, for lower-income housing? They're all full. List... The whole city's trying to get on that list. How is she? She's not good. I can't give you an advance, Vince. Son, I just don't have it. Look here. I want you to hear this. Hear me now. I'm saying no to the money, but not to you. I'm proud of you for asking me, 'cause I know it ain't easy, and I know you trying to do something with your life now. And I want you to know I believe in you. We'll figure this out. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. How come you believe in him? Past three years, you been saying that Vince ain't nothing but a no-good lowlife, and suddenly you find it so necessary to be there for him. I can never get you to come to Caleb's games or show up to the Lions' games when I'm dancing on the sidelines or come to my academic smackdown when I'm scoring points, but... you want to go and watch Vince practice. And you're proud of him. I try really hard to make you proud too. Babe. Hey, honey? What do you think Julie would do if she got pregnant? - What? - She's not pregnant, honey. But what do you think she would do? What are you doing? I mean, would she... Would she talk to us? She would talk to us, wouldn't she? What would she do? - Oh, babe, it's 3:00 in the morning. - You think she'd feel comfortable... You want to talk about Julie and having a hypothetical pregnancy. Are you crazy? That's just wrong. We're both having nightmares. Well, don't do that. Come to bed. Come to bed. Come. Y'all come to bed. Can't sleep? How's the hip? It's good. Something's bothering you. I don't know what it is. I'm not gonna pry if it's none of my business. I'm good. Is it football? I'm your dad. If something's bothering you, it's bothering me. There's a girl, and I got her pregnant. I got a girl pregnant. I really didn't mean to disappoint you. I'm sorry. Vince, come here. Come here. - Yes? - Look, this series, don't wait on your reads. You see something you like, you take it. - But you said... - Don't worry about what I said. Worry about what I'm telling you right now, understood? Yeah. - We good? - Yeah. Good. Okay, they're running wing trips, double slant. I want you to run to the slant, and I want you to knock Vince on his ass. Why are you telling us the play? I tell you because I want you to sack Vince, and if you can't do that now, you really are a bunch of jug butts. - Ready? - Break! Ready. Set. Hut, hike! Your father told me what's happened. I couldn't keep something like this from your mother. It's okay, Luke. Mary and Joseph thought they were in a situation, too, at first. Becky and me are not Mary and Joseph, mom. Becky. That's her name? Well, we need to meet this Becky, and then we'll figure out what to do. How did you figure out how to get up here? Well, any place I go, I look for the highest building or vantage point or whatever, and I try to find a way up. This is pretty good. It's higher up than any building in Pavones, Costa Rica. What's the best place you've ever been? That's easy. Senegal, West Africa. I'll show you. Which is maybe 9,000 miles that way, which would make Oaxaca 1,000 miles in this direction and New York 1,500 miles that way. What about you? Where are you headed... eventually? Eventually... I don't know. Do you hate it here? I used to hate it, and then... I just... kind of changed. I guess I just... I really want to see the world. And that sounds really cliche. No, it doesn't. Look. What? That's you... seeing the world. It's really beautiful up here. This is the... stupidest thing we've ever done. Stupidest thing we've ever done by far. I don't want to hear about it right now, Tim. This hole... never gonna be big enough, Billy. You know what, man? I am sick of your lame-ass attitude! God, I mean... You gotta make it a 100 times worse than what it is! Is it a bad situation? Yes! Are we doing everything that we can to get out of it? You bet your ass we are! I don't understand what the point of jumping on my case about it is - every 5 seconds. - The point is, I'm done. I'm done. We've made our money. We've made it and then some. Promise me we're out. This is it. No more illegal crap, no more chop shop. We're done. It's over, Billy. Let's just go back to fixing cars. Riggins' Rigs, brothers, that's it. Keep it simple. Promise me that. We're done. And I want you to stop yelling at me because I didn't go to college. Anything else? And I also want to be a partner. Maybe. I'm kidding. Just 'cause you're a partner doesn't mean I can't tell you to dig, so... let's dig. Is Miss Taylor here? Yeah, she is. Come on in. Hon, it's all right. You wanna go on into the kitchen. I'm really sorry I woke you guys up. It's okay. It's all right. Go on back to bed, sweetheart. I've an appointment for my abortion tomorrow. My mom knows. She's coming with me. Good. Yeah. So why do I feel so weird? 'Cause it's a hard thing. This is a hard situation. Have you thought about what you want? We don't have any money. I'm in the tenth grade. It was my first time... and I threw it away, but I don't want to throw my life away. It was just really obvious that my mom wants me to have this abortion... 'Cause I was her mistake. And she has to just struggle and hurt every day, and she wanted better, and I knew better, and I was just thinking, "Forget what she wants." Like, "What do I want?" Maybe I could take care of this baby, and maybe I would be good at it. And I could love it, and I would be there for it. And then I was just thinking about how awful it would be if I had the baby, and then I spent the rest of my life resenting him... Or her. Do you think I'm going to hell if I have an abortion? No, honey, I don't. What would you tell your daughter? I would tell her... to think about her life... and think about what's important to her and what she wants. And I'd tell her that she's in a real tough spot... and that I would support her whatever decision she made. I can't take care of a baby. I can't. You guys want a ride? No, we'll be okay. Let's get this kid back! Come on! What? Come on, 44! Come on, 44! Push him inside! Get the 15, come on! Okay, Caleb! How many times I got to tell you, you want to push your man inside! Don't let him use the sideline! Hey, force him into the middle so that he can't use his speed! That's the third time they've run that sweep play. You got to be ready for it. Hey, Caleb! You have fun out there, hear? All right. And visiting hours are on thursdays between 4:00 and 7:00. And group starts in about ten minutes, so... - I'll give you a few moments, okay? - Appreciate that. You know I'm gonna be home real soon, okay? And I-I-I don't want you worrying about me. Listen to me. I believe in you. You can do this. I know. I can do this. Come here. Come on, mom. It's okay. - Thank you. - Good luck, Vince. For today, the total bill will be $4,000. How did you want to pay for that? There you go. Okay, thank you. Thank you. I got you, man. I'm sorry it's been so hard for us to talk the last couple of days. Listen, Becky, if... I'm sorry if in any way I've made you feel like this whole thing</i> is just your problem, 'cause it's not, okay?</i> I guess I just really need you to know that... you're not in... That I'll be there no matter what, okay? I will... Like, help us raise our kid or help you. And I know that we're young, and I know that we don't know</i> each other very well right now, but... that doesn't matter. What matters is that you need to know you're not alone in this.</i> Luke, I took care of it. So you don't have to worry. Okay. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. It was the right thing to do. Yeah. Thanks for calling me.
