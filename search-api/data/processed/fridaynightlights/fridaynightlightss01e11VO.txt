Friday Night Lights 1x11 Nevermind Transcript: Raceman Sync: Tauri41 ..:: www.forom.com ::.. Man, look, it's just-- Yeah, I know, Medicare-- Medicare says that they'll pay for all that, but for some reason, I have this bill saying that I owe $348. Matthew? Matthew, have you got that leaky faucet fixed yet? - Um, yeah, I know-- - Get your dad to help you. Grandma, Dad's in Iraq, remember? So,  look, what I'm really trying to figure out here - is if you can maybe arrange some kind of... - He's out front - in-home visits or something... -  Go help him. if, you know, Medicare will pay for that as well. Can--can you hold on one sec? Go help him with his bags. - All right. I'm gonna go look, okay? - Yeah. Dad? Matt. You're home! You're home! You're home! P-A-N-T-H-E-R-S. Bring it in, guys. Bring 'em in, guys! Let's go, let's go! Listen up--perfection is the order of the day. Anything else is unacceptable, understood? Yes, sir. We leave the mistakes up to the Westcott Warriors. Also, First Baptist is having their annual Panther dinner on Thursday night, so you'll be there. Uh-uh, uh-uh. I don't wanna hear it. You'll have your jackets. You'll have your ties. There's gonna be no foul language. You're not gonna make jackasses out of yourself. Don't embarrass me. Don't embarrass the school. - Understood? - Yes, sir. All right, coach, break it down. Come on, let's hit it! One, two, three! Can't lose! Miss Levine told me that you're in real trouble in her English class. Yeah, well, why don't we just put me into an easier class? That's not really the problem, is it? I hear you got an oral report due this week. You started reading that book yet? Uh, no, I haven't, but I am lookin' forward to it. You get help on your homework, Tim? Maybe from the Rally Girls sometimes? No. Never. Not once. All right, you know, that Scarlet Letter paper that y'all wrote-- I mean, Julie was up all night long writing that one. Did--did you write that one? Oh, yeah. You did? Yep. Oh! Could I see it? Wow, "Modern Themes in The Scarlet Letter." A -. Look at that. What's The Scarlet Letter about, Tim? You know what it's about. - I do know. - Yeah. What's  The Scarlet Letter about? It's about, uh, a gal that, uh, named Scarlet, obviously-- Tim, you did not write this paper. What's the big deal? Well, the big deal is that it's part of my job to make sure that you don't grow up stupid. It's bad for the world. That's not funny, Tim. That is not funny. So you know what--I'm making it my personal responsibility to make sure that you don't get any more free passes from your teachers. From here on in, you're gonna sink or you're gonna swim, based on you, based on your work. You get me? We're two wins away from playoffs, Mrs. Taylor. I appreciate that. The timing of this couldn't be worse. Well, I'm sorry. I don't pass, I don't play. Well, then, I think we'd better get you to pass. Yep! Yeah! Oh, yeah! Yeah, baby! Mike Jones for the ladies, baby, yeah! Good Lord, that boy's good. Herc. Hmm? How do I have sex? Oh, my goodness. My boy's growin' up. No, seriously. I just need a little information. I kinda had a... a little-- a little mishap, if you will. Mishap? - Yeah. - By yourself or with a girl? With a girl. I just-- I was having trouble, uh-- I was having trouble... staying at attention. You know what I mean? I do know what you mean, but I'm proud of you anyway. Where'd you find her? It's not important. I didn't catch that name. Who was this again? It was Lyla. Come on. No! Boo! Uh-uh! What-- what are you sayin' to me? Well, of course your ding dong went soft. - It was tryin' to protect you. - I know, I know. All right, it wasn't, like, my proudest moment, but if you'd hold back on the judgment just a little bit right now, that'd be great. 'Cause this is really helping me right now. I know what you want. I know what you want. You wanna grab her and do her, huh? - Make her forget about that other guy, right? - Yes. Just bang the bejesus out of her. Exactly. That's exactly what I wanna do. Yeah. Not gonna happen. Least not for a while, anyway. Why not? Dude, you're like a newborn baby. You don't know how to do anything. Look, man, whatever worked for you before may not work now, you know? You just gotta figure out what turns you on, you know? Like, will I ever be able to-- What, shoot fireworks? - Yeah. - Have a super happy fun time? - Yeah. - Yes. Probably. Just maybe not every time. Look, nothing's like it was, you know? But don't look so glum, man. There's more to life than hit it and quit it, QB, trust me. Landry. Landry. Hi. How you doing? Good. Do you know Tim Riggins? He's lookin' for an English tutor, and I think you would be just perfect. Do  you? Yeah, I do, and I just want you to know that he wants to really improve his grades. He's looking to expand his mind. Don't go easy on him. Spend as much time as you need. Do whatever you need to do, and y'all get in there and get it goin'. And I think you'll be great. Thanks, Landry. Okay, um-- Good luck. Okay. Go! Set! Hut! There it is. That's nice, Matt. That's nice. Set. Coach Taylor, you seen this? Huh? Texas Football magazine. Top ten high school coaches in the state of Texas. - You're on this list? - Right there, Coach. Oh, there's no livin' with him now. Better watch what you say. Says "up and coming." How 'bout that? Coach, we're getting T-shirts with that on it. - It'll be on the radio. - Sweaters. That's a three-minute break. Three minutes. Let's go! Hey, Dad. - Lookin' good, Matt. - Thanks. I think I'm gonna take off. I got some sleep to catch up on. Wait, can you hold on a minute? I want you to meet the coach. Hey, come here, come here. This is my dad. Coach! Yeah. Uh, this is my dad, Henry Saracen. This is Coach Taylor. This is my dad. - How do you do? - Pleasure to meet you. Pleasure to meet you. You're, uh, you're on leave? Yeah, he's home for two weeks. That's good--you gonna get to see your son play a little bit? I hope so. He's done a hell of a job leadading this team, I tell you. Not much trouble from him, huh? He's a little bit of trouble. He's not too much trouble. He's been a pleasure to teach, I can tell you that. I  didn't know he had it in him. He's got plenty in him. He's been a good team leader out here. I'll tell you what. You can be proud of your son. Just hope he keeps doin' okay under pressure. You betcha. Well, I gotta run, Coach. I'll talk to you later. - It was a pleasure to meet you. - Very nice meeting you. I'll see you at home, Son. Yeah, I'll see you at home, Dad. Thanks--thanks, Coach. OK, go get some drink now he's probably just having a hard time trying to express himself. Yeah, maybe. You know what it is? He's probably all messed up from the war. That's exactly what it is-- he's gone war crazy from the, you know, Operation Freedom flashbacks and stuff. He's not war crazy. He's just-- He--he should see you play. I mean, if you get him to one of the games, he'll understand what all of the fuss is about. Yeah. I guess. Is he gonna help you get some in-home care for your grandma? Well, yeah, he's gonna straighten all that out. I mean, really, this is, like, a perfect time for him to come home because, clearly, I can't get it done. You know what, Matty? I think what he needs is to come and see... my new band, Crucifictorious! Anyone? Broken Spoke. This Friday after the game. Doors open at 11:00--you gotta get there early, though. It's gonna be pretty packed. We have to go to that, don't we? Well, if we don't go, I don't really think anyone else is gonna be there, so-- Yep. Hi. Hey. Guess what I have. What? Dirty, dirty, dirty quad porn. What? Before you engage in any sexual activity with a partner, it will be helpful to know how your new body works. This can most effectively be done by masturbation. Listen, Lyla, can we just shut this off and talk for a few-- No I know it's not exactly the porn you were expecting, but there's some useful stuff in here. Keepin' it open mind and using your imagination in your wheelchair can allow for spotting and pleasure in sexual activity. Enjoy yourself I wasn't expecting any porn. No, Jason, wait! Listen, I know this is weird, but we can get through this. That's not what I'm-- I think we were really close before. It's not about sex. And a lot of couples have very good luck in the shower. You wanna get laid that bad, call Riggins. You know what? I don't know about you, Tim, but I am excited about your new journey into the wonderful world of American literature. I really, really am. What do you think of the name Crucifictorious? I wanted to go with Stigmatalingus, - but I, uh, got outvoted. - They're both crap, Landry. I mean, that's great. You are entitled to your opinion. That's just what makes America so great. Just being honest. Okay, Of Mice and Men. The good news is it's a short book--it's a hundred pages, so you can pretty much rock it out in one night. Right on that. Oh, my God, you can't read, can you? Is that it? You're one of those kids who just slipped through the cracks? I can read, you joke. I just choose not to. That's cute. That's real cute. I got a show you might wanna come to. Still like it almost burnt? Yes, sir. There you go. Look at that. It's good, Matthew. Thanks. Beats the hell out of them MREs. Is that one done? Oh, yeah, it's done. Relax. What is she so nervous for? She's always like this--that's what I was trying to tell you. That's why I wanna try and get a nurse in here or something like that. I'm  not nervous. I--I know. So, what's it, um, wh-what's it like over there in Iraq? Good. Building schools. Doing a lot of good. Yeah, so when do you think it's gonna be over? When do you think you can come home for--for good? I tell you this-- we're not gonna leave until those people have a stable government. You know, uh, there's some people that think that we should just, you know, get everybody out of there and come home. Do you know what would happen if we left? How many innocent people would die? We're gonna stay until we finish what we started, Matt. Well, I'm not really saying-- I wasn't saying anything. I just, you know, I just like it when you're home. Hey, I got you. No, I got it. Come on, now. I already dragged the other one out here. I can drag this one out too. You're gonna do the last 3 feet and take all the credit for it? I'm not gonna give you the credit now. I got the other one out-- Hey-- I can't believe you just did that. - I didn't do anything. -  Look at that! - Come on, just-- - That's a disaster. I'll get it. I'll get it. Let me ask you something. Did you, by chance, make it your personal mission to take over the education of Tim Riggins? I am, actually, yes. You know, I found out that he's been having the Rally Girls do his homework for I don't know how long. That's very nice of you, but we're both aware of the no pass, no play policy. Yeah, I'm very aware of that, mm-hmm. And if you would just think about this-- I know that you're not about to say-- - It's just for the next couple games. - What I think you're gonna say. We got a chance at the playoffs. 'Cause you know what the answer is gonna be, because you know what-- he's been cheatin', honey. And I don't even want to ask you if you knew that he's been cheating. But he's been cheating, and I know you don't want me to turn my back on that. No, I didn't know he was cheating, and I know how important the kid's schooling is. What I'm saying is that the next couple of games-- Do you, though--you think it's as important as winning? I mean, really, do you? You're really asking me that question? - You're asking me that question? - Can you answer the question? No, I can't answer the question, because you won't let me finish talking. Well, you know what, it does not do Tim Riggins a bit of good to grow up ignorant and mean and dumb. What are you talking about? That's what you are encouraging with these boys. - I'm not encouraging that. - Yes, you are! I know how important his education is. No, you're making 'em feel like what this town makes 'em feel like, which is that football is the most important thing. If we send that message to him, that's what he's gonna believe. - You've gotta be kidding me. - No, I'm not. - You gotta be kidding me. - I'm not kidding you. You know I'm not kidding you. I can't believe that we're even disagreeing about this. I can't believe you're even asking me to do that. Hello. It's Coach Taylor. Yeah. I'll get the rest of the garbage. Hey, Coach. Yes, sir. Well, I mean, I can't make any commitments, obviously-- Well, sure. All right, well, I'll look forward to your call. You can consider the conversation open, of course. All right, you too. Thanks, Coach. What? Who was that? That was an assistant coach from over at UT. They want to know if I had any interest in quarterback coach next season. Uh-uh. That's what the man said. Nuh-uh. Really? Get outta here! You're fooling me. Really? Hey, Riggins. Hey, Riggins, when do you want to get together and work on that book report? Oh, man, I haven't read that. Why have you not read it? I don't know. I didn't get around to it. Okay, just checking. That's great. Um, you know if you don't pass, you don't play, right? What do you want me to do? You want me to read it to you myself? A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green. The water is warm, too, for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool. What did I just say just now? I don't know--some stuff about a river. Okay, well, what did this river look like? It's real pretty, Landry. Okay. On one side of the river-- What the hell is Riggins doin' in there? Studying. Hey, Dad. What, uh-- what are you doing? Your grandma's driving me crazy. I had to get out of the house. She can be a little much sometimes. Why didn't you tell me how bad it was? Well, it's not that bad-- Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! Huh? Grandma, you all right? You gotta be kidding me. What did I tell you about using the stove? What is wrong with you? You're acting like a damn child! Dad, calm down. It was an accident. I told you three times to lay away from the stove! Dad, don't yell at her. You're just gonna scare her. You okay? No, no, no. Don't cry, it's okay. I don't even know what happened, honey. Why is he mad at me? He's not. He's just scared. All right? We were all just scared, all right? What happened? It's all right. It's all over, okay? You all right? It's not your fault, okay? The Medicare is not gonna pay for at-home care unless she has a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's. Well, let's get her a diagnosis, then. What about a home? What? My veterans' benefits should cover that. Yeah, there's some homes in the area. But she's Matt's legal guardian. If she's in a home, that's not gonna work. There's another option. Mr. Saracen, you might be able to get out of your service if there's no one else to look-- No, I can't do that. What? Why not? That-- that would be perfect. It's out of the question, Matt. We're not done over there yet. But, Dad, it's grandma-- I'm not gonna argue about it with you. We all have to make sacrifices. I know, I underst-- Stop, Matt. Thank you. I think we've heard enough here. Slim said, 'You hadda, George. I swear you hadda. Come on with me. He led George to the entrance of the trail and up toward the highway. Curley and Carlson looked after them, and Carlson said, What the hell you suppose is eatin' them two guys?' Damn. The guy shot his best friend. Intense. Now he's become the kind of man he said he never wanted to be. Exactly. - I gotcha. - Exactly. Without Lennie, George lost all his humanity. Yeah, that's messed up. Okay, so oral report. All right, first, you give a brief plot summary, and then you list the themes and how they relate to you. So, how do they relate to you? Go. I don't know. You don't-- Okay, we just got done discussing this whole thing. That was talking. This is different. How is this different? This is the same exact thing. Just tell me what you-- Seriously, what do you want me to say? You know, why don't you just do it for me? - Just do it for you? - Yeah. No, I'm not gonna just do it for you. I mean-- My God, you really are ridiculous. Do you just have the Rally Girls do everything for you? I mean, do they just chew your food and wipe your butt for you-- how does this work? I just sat here and read the entire-- the entire book to you, and you have nothing to say. There's gotta be something in this head of yours that you can relate to. I don't know. - There's gotta be something! - I don't know. What don't you know? Okay, listen--listen. Okay, this--this is a book about two best friends who have a dream that gets crushed. They have a dream that gets crushed. You can't tell me that there's not something in this head of yours that you can relate this to. There's gotta be something! My Go-- You know, here's an example how I can relate to this. I would really, really like to shoot you right now. Okay, so you know what? Just take the book, and I'm done. You can figure it out on your own from here. God. - Jason. - Hey, Mrs. Taylor. - How are you, honey? - I'm good, I'm good. - Um, how are you? - I'm good. Did you wheel yourself all the way over here? Yeah, I did. It's no big deal. I do it all the time. Oh, my--well, did you want to see Coach? He's not here. He's at a meeting. And then we got this church dinner. Um, well, you know what? Come on inside. You know what? I was just thinking about you. I was just thinking about when you might feel like you're ready to go back to school. I, uh, I haven't really thought about it yet. Just keep in mind that you can come back any time you want. I mean, you don't have to, you know, wait for the new semester or anything like that. I know. You've practically got all your courses taken care of anyway. You've only got a few credits left. Yeah, just, I'm-- I don't know if I'm ready to be part of the, uh, Dillon High rumor mill right now. I got enough to handle. Are you talking about that thing with Lyla? I'm just so confused, you know. It's just-- I saw Lyla the other day, and we just-- Don't tell Coach, please. Oh, no. I won't. And I kinda, sorta tried to get back together, and-- I want to. I just want to, you know? But I'm just having such a hard time with it. It's just-- It's just--it's Lyla. I wish it was someone else. I wish it was someone different. I wish I could just hate her and walk away from it and be done with it, 'cause it would be so much easier. Be a lot easier. But I love her, you know? And-- We were gonna get married. Mm. That's a hard thing. It's a hard, hard thing. But I will say there's no weakness in forgiveness. If that's what you decide. Look what I found. Your mom gave it to me about a hundred years ago. You want it? Sure. Thanks. Talked to your Aunt Peg in Oklahoma, and she said she's willing to have you live with her. You don't have to do that. I can stay here. I can take care of grandma just like I-- just like I been doing. Something's gotta be done, all right? And I found a home for her. Grandma's not even--she's-- She won't even know anyone there. Matt, look, I know this ain't easy. All right? Let me help you with that. It's fine. Let me help you. I'm gonna be late. I just gotta go, okay? Let us pray. Dear Lord, our heavenly Father, we ask that you give these boys the strength to be guided by you and to be vessels for your saving message. And to play with the passion that you yourself have blessed them with. Amen. Amen. Let's have some barbecue. Hey. Coach. I don't give you the impression that I think of you only as a football player, do I? I bring this up because, as usual, my wife is always right. You got your midterms comin' up. I'm gonna be in contact with your teachers. I'm gonna know what's goin' on. There are gonna be no more free rides. You're gonna start paying. And hear me when I say this. No pass... no play. So, uh, where's your dad? He's not coming. But I thought you said he was gonna come. Yeah, but he's just not coming, okay? He has something to do. That kinda sucks. What does he have that's so impor-- I don't know. He just has something that's going on, okay? - Are you okay? - No, I'm not. And you picking at me's not helping, so could we just not talk about it? Yeah--yeah, Matt. Whatever. Midway through the third quarter Westward 24 Dillon 14</i> Red 40! Red 40! Red 40! Hike! He drops back. He's got Dolia! He's wide open in the flats. Come on, son. You gotta get rid of that! Get up, Son, and go! Get up. Matt Saracen is just not on his game tonight, folks.</i> Hut! It's a bad pitch. Williams picks it up. Oh nice stiff arm. He gets to the end zone!</i> He's got one man to beat. Smash Williams, touchdown. Dillon Panthers.</i> Saracen! Come here. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something-- Smash is out there. He is covering for your ass right now. You better screw your head on real tight, you understand me? Yes, Coach. Come on, you heard him. Get your head in the game, boy. Start of the fourth quarter. Westward with the ball. Hey! Hey! That's nice! That's gonna bring a fourth down. Dolia, Smash, come here, come here. We're going for the block. We're going for the block. I want Kripa right. Kripa right, you understand? Hey, get there. And Dillon gets it back. All right, let's get up and now let's go. Capitalize right here. Time to capitalize, baby. Come on. Hey, get on your feet and make some noise! Get up and make some noise! Hey, listen, they press their cornerback tight on first down. I wanna go deep. One big play wipes away all the little mistakes. We walk outta here winners. Do you understand me? Yes, sir. What's the call? Pro gun right, X, Y cross. Got it? Then let it fly. Go long, Matt. Make something happen, baby, come on! And here comes Matt Saracen back onto the field.</i> With Plenty of time in the fourth quarter</i> to get his team back into this. Green, 12! Hut! Oh, and the safety's out of position.</i> Williams streaks up the sideline.</i> Matt Saracen let it fly Oh no, and Matt Saracen just overthrew Smash Williams</i> by a mile. That could have been an easy touchdown for Dillon.</i> Start warming up Weston. Weston, let's go! Warm it up. Time! Time! Step out. It's not your night, son. Coach Taylor's benched Matt Saracen</i> and is sending in second string quarterback Brett Weston.</i> This might be a risky move, but the way Saracen's played tonight,</i> what does Coach Taylor have to lose?</i> There you go, baby! There you go! There you go! Good game, Coach. Very good. Yes, sir! You'll get 'em next time, Matt. You're sending me to Oklahoma. You can play football anywhere. Go to hell, Dad. What'd you say? I said go to hell. Matt, just get in the truck right now, and we'll talk-- I'm not getting in the truck with you, and I'm not gonna go home with you. You know, I thought you were gonna come home from Iraq and actually be able to help, but you've only made things worse. Do you know what? Actually, why don't you just go back to Iraq? 'Cause things worked out a lot better when you were there. Really, you calling me all the time--"Help me. "Grandma can't do anything right. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do." I'm sorry--it's hard to pay the rent and go to school and take-- Try being me for five minutes! - Try being you? - What have you done? You think I wanna come home to this? - Now get in the truck. - I'm not going anywhere with you. Get in the truck. You get in the truck. Where you gonna go? I don't know. Let me know when you go back to Iraq. Come on. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Lookee here. Wow. What do you think? That's some intense stuff, man. Very intense. - Showed up. - Didn't think you would. You wanna know why? Why? 'Cause you're looking at a B-. You got a B-? - Not too shabby, huh? - There you go. Look at you, turning into a scholar on me. I appreciate your help, man. I really do. And, I'm sorry I just caught the last bit of your, uh, set there, so-- No, no, no, don't worry. We got a whole 'nother set coming up, so-- No worries, my friend, we'll put you-- you know, you're with me, so we'll put you right up here at the front, okay? That's great. You can't just stand there, though. You gotta-- You gotta do that a lot. You're incredibly stealthy. - You could be like a glamorous jewel thief. - Shut up. You can go into breaking and entering for a living. What are you doing here, Lyla? Can't seem to kick the habit. If it's gonna end between us, I guess I can't help that. But... it can't end the way it did the other night. I just wanted to be close to you again, Jason. I'm trying, Lyla. I really am. I love you. I know. Hey. What are you doing? I just don't want him to go. Come on. Let's get ready for bed. That's it. Grandma's going into a home, and I'm going to Oklahoma. Want me to talk to him? I'll talk to him, see if we can work something out. Nothing to work out. Listen to me. We're all family here. I'll do anything I can for you. You know that. Hell, Buddy Garrity, he ain't gonna let you cross the state line without finishing this season. He'll call out the damn national guard if he has to. I hate him. I hate my dad. Hey, don't do that. Don't make that mistake. You think about what you just said.
