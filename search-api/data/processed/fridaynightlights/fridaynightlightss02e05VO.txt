That's really mature. - Come back here right now. - Dad, it's all over the paper. I'll have human resources send over termination package tonight. - Hope you know what you're doing. - They are embryonic stem cells. You're gonna give him a shot from a shark? - What am I supposed to do? - Come. Help me talk him out of it. Come to mexico? You're outta your mind. I've got to go. They just pulled a body out of the river. - We have no choice. - We do have a choice. I could turn myself in. That's what I'm gonna do. And spend the rest of your life in jail? Jason Street, he's got wheelchair... Makin' fun of cripples now, Lyla? Nice hat. Did I miss something? What are you doing here? Tim didn't tell you I was coming? Wait a minute. He called you here? You're the Christian Coalition? - He's worried about this procedure. - Riggins, get your ass out here! - Do you call Lyla and tell her to come? - You didn't tell him? You made it. My quarterback and runningback are fighting on the field and I don't know where the fullback is. - Frustrating. - Frustrating. What's with the candles? Where's the baby? Out there sleeping. Where do you think she is? How did everything go at the doctor's? Well, aren't you sweet to ask about little ol' me. Well, she said everything's going just great. I'm a little bit anemic, but that's to be expected. Anemic, that means low on iron. You need to take vitamins. As I've been doing, but everything's real good. Thank you for asking. So did you... by chance get the... the green light? - Green light? - Yeah. What do you mean? Come on. When Julie... was born we got the... That's amazing that you remember that little tidbit of information. - Of course I remember. - Incredible. What are you thinking? I'm thinking it's been a long time for you. I'm thinking about us and I'm thinking about... together time. Together time. Not just for us... You know what would be really great? Yeah, I do. You and Gracie. And you already put her out there. You go out there with her. I can get a good night's sleep. That would be the best gift you could give me. - I don't want to. - It has been so long. Thank you, honey. Thank you for thinking. Close that door behind you. - You know what? - Love you, sweetheart. 2x05: LET'S GET IT ON Transcript: Raceman Subtitles: Andy, GillesSilb, Ju, Sixe I don't know what is going on, what's being said. All I see is Riggins throwing dollars at the guy. There's kind of a major language barrier there too. Anyway, that's how he ended up spread eagle on the hood of a car. Looks like you found a new level of dumb down here. - We're trying anyway. - Yeah, trying to. So we're sitting there and Riggs... All right. I'll see you. Oh, sorry. So, um, how are you doing? - Good. - That's awesome. This has to be one of the most awkward conversations of my life. Actually, it's not as bad as last night. Grandma tryin' to explain me where babies come from. - So what did you do about it? - I just turned the tv on. As soon as I heard the word stork, I just put on Law and Order. - And pretended not to hear her. - Good thinking. Well, my friends are waiting so I should probably go. - No. - No what? - What? - Just no. You know what I'm talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. I'll see you at practice. There he is! Oh, my god. Let's go! - This team trying to impress me? - I tried to warn you, Coach. * That makes me sick. - Round 'em up. - Bring it in on me! Come on, let's go! All right, ladies. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna switch positions for the remainder of the practice. Backs go to the line. Offense/defense, defense/offense. Coaches, get 'em in their groups and let's go have some fun. You got two minutes! - Two minutes to change out. - Let's go. Big number for a little number! It's easy. Get him! - Who's that kid? - Who? - 43, that * looking kid. - That's Saracen's friend. - Who, Lance? - I believe Lndry. Landry Clarke I think. You don't gotta hit me every time you touch the ball. I need to mix this up. I'm not playing noseguard. - You need to get down on the line. - I don't get on all fours for nobody. That ain't what I heard. That's just the talk around the locker room. What you gonna do? I swear to god, I'm telling you... Hey, get over here! You two. I want you over on the 40 with coach there. - 50 up downs. - He's talking trash! All right, 100. 100! Everything okay? Good. Got them bags under your eyes. Have trouble at home? What? You know, a new baby can be a son of bitch sometime. You and Tami back in the saddle yet? What the hell you talking about? I just found that when me and Susan got... romantic again that it just kinda... everything fell into place, you know? Tell you what I did. Gave her a night out with the girls. Gets a night away from the baby. Has a drink or two. Comes home that night, boom. Back in the saddle again. Do me a favor. Not now or ever again, I don't want to hear about you and Susan ridin' in the saddle. Understood. Thank you. Might want to bring some flowers home too. It's always a nice touch. Susan likes the tulips. What did they say after that? - Did they ask you where you were? - They just said thank you and I left. That's it? That's it. Well, okay. I am freaking out. - Don't freak out. - Don't tell me what to do. I am freaking... Why aren't you freaking out? You know, I guess I'm taking a break. You're taking... You're taking a break. Look, Landry, this could lead right to us. - You realize that? - To me. - This was both of us. - No, it was me. - It wasn't... It wasn't you. - Fine, this could lead to you. You could go to jail because of me. I'm sorry. Hey Chad, hearing good things about the boy. We'll be seeing him under the lights before long. - Yeah, he's doing okay. - We'll be watching. - I appreciate you mentioning that. - Open container violation. Shoplifting, dropped. Shoplifting, no contest. Another open container again. Truancy, indecent exposure, public drunkenness... we have found ourselves a real upstanding citizen. Got a real rep in the sex department too. Got a sister who's a stripper. - What are you guys talking about? - Hey, troop. What'd she do? Eight months back our murder Vic tried to rape her. So you pulled her report. Is she a suspect? She's definitely a person of interest. - Here's that information... - Thanks, appreciate that. - What are you doing? - I'm leaving. What do you mean? - I'm just... I'm going. - Why? - You just think this is a big joke. - I don't think it is. All you've done is go to whore houses and karaoke bars. Yeah, well what else did you do you do in Mexico, Garrity? You're an idiot. You think this is easy for me? You call me down here to help and Jason didn't even know. - You have no plan whatsoever. - As a matter of fact I do. - Oh, really? What's your plan, Tim? - It's right here. A booze cruise? This is your plan? All inclusive, meals, snorkeling, dolphins. Yeah, a booze cruise. I thought it would be a good time to chat him up on the boat. You think the way to have a conversation with someone who's about to make the biggest mistake in his life - is by taking him on a booze cruise? - Yeah, kinda sorta. What? I don't even know where to begin to tell you how distorted your view of the world is. I'm distorted? My view's distorted? Really? - I disagree. - Yeah, really. - I'm not the one... - Really? I may be as screwed up as you say I am. And that's fine. Go with that. But at least I'm by J's side. At least I'm going through whatever it is we're gonna go through together. I will take him back in a box to Texas if I have to, Lyla. You? The second you saw us you were ready to get on that next plane back to Texas. That kinda sucks for J and for me. You know what? You know I'm right. You just won't admit it. I sin daily and I'm a better christian than you, Garrity. Fine. I'll go on your stupid booze cruise. Better man up and have a conversation with me. This is an intervention, Tim, and I can't do this by myself. - Here. - I got it! I need some extra cash too for that booze cruise. I smell bacon. She's sleeping. You did all the wake ups last night and you're cooking breakfast? And you got tulips? You know what I am? I'm a husband taking care of his wife. What's wrong with that? I don't think anything's wrong. I just don't know who you are. What have you done with my husband? - Here, here's some... - Thank you. You're welcome. - I tell you what. - What? Gonna be some changes around here. What kind of changes? You want to know what kind of changes? What day is today? It's wednesday. And what happens wednesday nights? I would know that because of this new chart I've created. Let's see, wednesday. Oh, gee, there's book club tonight. No, I don't want to go to book club. - Yes, you do wanna go. - Those ladies are crazy. You are going to book club. Let me tell you why, you're gonna relax. Gonna spend some time with your friends. Gonna have a few glasses of wine. And you're gonna enjoy yourself. That's why. All right? A man takes care of his wife. You are really starting to get this whole trigonometry thing. I am so excited to get out in the world and use some of this. 'Cause I'm sure it's gonna come in handy some time. Don't sell yourself short. You don't know what's gonna happen. You may wake up and want to be a structural engineer. You're right. As soon as I quit waitressing, that's what I plan to do. That's what I thought. Okay. - Bye. - See ya. - Hey, dad. - Landry. - How you doing? - I'm pretty good. - How was practice today? - Okay. I made a tackle today, but... You and Tyra sure seem to be spending a lot of time together here lately. Yeah. I guess. I was talking about her with some of the detectives. Really? I need to ask you something... how come you didn't bother to tell me that the guy we pulled out of the river was the same one that tried to rape her? You serious? Well, you do know she was down at the station. You know that, don't you? No, I didn't know. You're spending a lot of time with each other. I just... The whole thing didn't make sense to me, to be honest with you. She just really doesn't want to talk about it. There's nothing else that I can say is that she... - she's not saying it. - Okay, I understand that. I'm just saying that ordinarily, in situations like this, people want somebody that they can talk to. That may be the case. - You're right about that... - It's a lot to carry alone, Landry! What is it that you want me to say? I don't... I don't know anything. Come on, I want to hear it. What's wrong? What's going on? I didn't have you over just to eat my chili. I want to know what the hell is going on. Nothing. Nothing? Yeah, nothing really. Right here at this table. I want it on the table. We're gonna air this out. I'm tired of Smash acting like he cares about the team at all. - I care about the team. - No, you don't care. You care about using the team to get your free ride to college. I worked years to get to this place. You only been starting one season. You're mad 'cause you can't call the coin toss. Everyone knows the C on my arm don't mean a thing. You're the one who keeps bringing it up. If you want to lead, get to it. Quit whining like a little bi-ch. Watch your mouth. What the hell do you think you're doing? - He's doing the same thing you did. - I'm sorry. How you just used us as a stepping stone to get to TMU. When that didn't work out you came back thinking we'd be happy to have you. Kind of like what your daughter do with the Polish Swedish kid, whatever the hell he is. - See what've been dealing with all... - Close the door on the way out. Look at my hair, look at my dog, look at my scooter. - Hi, honey. - How are you doing? How are you? Good. - How was the book club meeting? - It was really, really good. It was so nice to get out. It was nice to have some conversation with some people. - Good. - Very good, thank you. How was dinner? Dinner was... Dinner was pretty much a flop. Oh, no! Nothing your chili couldn't fix? No, no. Oh, that is awful. - You had a good time, didn't you? - I did. - You look very relaxed. - It was very, very relaxing. Was it? - What are you laughing at? - You know what's funny? Every single girl at that party had a six-week story. What's that? It's the story of their husbands wanting to have sex before they were ready to have sex after they had a baby. Isn't that funny? You know what those people are? Those are bad, dirty... Honey! My boobs are killing me. It's like concrete. I gotta go pump and dump, baby. I'm sorry. I love you. Don't touch me. Love you. Hey, how are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. So, I was wondering I have an extra ticket to the decemberists and I thought maybe... Oh, yeah. I mean it's not a date or anything. No, it's just the decemberists. Yeah. I just thought it would be fun and I miss hanging out with you. Yeah, well... No, that's good. I'll give you a call. - Okay. - Gimme a call. Yeah, I'll talk to you when you call me. Lance! You mean Landry? Come here. Come here. Yes, sir? If I put you in the game friday night how would you be with that? - You'd be ready? - Yes, sir. I'm ready right now. Well, that's it. All right. You can go now. - Hi, Mr. Clarke. - Hi, Tyra. How are you today? I'm good. How are you? Good. You mind if I come in for a minute? - Yeah, sure. Come on in. - Thank you. - Can I get you a water or something? - No, thank you. ... He's all hands. - Why is there a cop in my living room? - This is Landry's father, Mr. Clarke. - Afternoon. - Hey. Go put some clothes on. - Did you want to have a seat? - I don't need to sit, Tyra. This is gonna be, uh, pretty cut and dry. This whole you and Landry thing has never... made much sense to me, but I think maybe it's starting to right now. I don't really know what you're talking about. The fact that you two just happened to get together about the same time this dead guy shows up. That's what I'm talking about, Tyra. I'm sorry but are you accusing me of something? I'm not here today as a cop. And God forbid it'll never come to that. I'm here talking to you as a father who is worried about his son. Landry has never lied to me. Never. But he's lying to me now. About you. I don't know what you're involved with but I am not about to let him get dragged into it. I hope I'm wrong. I really do. But either way, you're gonna do something for me. And this is not a request. You stay away from by boy. You got that? Here you go, Mrs. Taylor. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you so much. - So that's Gracie then. This is Gracie bell. - Just about to fall asleep. - She's cute. Does she do anything yet? Mostly just a baby, but she's pretty cute. We'll keep her. Did julie tell you that we're hanging out this weekend? That's... I did hear about that. - That should be fun. - That should be great. That should be good. Thank you so much. You don't think, like, I'm a chump, do you, for going out with her again? Or hanging out with her again. Landry keeps saying I'm a chump and I should've just said "No, I won't hang out with you again." You know, it doesn't matter. I mean, it's important what you think. - I think that's the important thing. - Right, I think that I miss her. I mean, I know I miss her. Just, you know, after, you know. Well, it's an awkward position for me to... But I think you have... Listen, I just think the most important thing in a relationship is trust. That's... - That's true. - Pretty much most important thing. Yeah, well thanks. You probably gotta go to your car. Do you need a hand? Jacques Cousteau. Not funny? So this is it, huh? We've been talking. We don't think this stem cell thing's such a great idea. Look, I know you feel lost and you're looking for hope but it's false hope. Why are you here? Why is she even here? We don't want you to do this on a whim. - I've been researching it for weeks... - Weeks? Come on, even the doctor said there's a good chance of dying on the table. I want out of this chair, all right? I want out of this chair. Not next month, not next year, but I want out now! All right, this is a way to do that. You can't look me in the eye and tell me what it's like to live in this chair. So I'm gonna do this. Y'all can't stop me. Get on the table. If I die, I'm fine with that. No. You have so much to live for. - Actually I don't, Lyla. - Yes, you do, Jason. I know it doesn't seem like it right now but everything happens for a reason. God has a plan. - No God card. - What? God and I aren't exactly friends since He breaked my neck. You don't want religion. How about the fact that this is a stupid idea and you're being an idiot. Maybe I'll just let some Jesus freak dunk my head under the water and wash all my troubles away. It's that easy, right? Or maybe I'll just grab a twelver. Right, Riggins? That'll fix my spine right up. Maybe I could sleep with the single woman from across the street. You know what? I get it, J. I get you want to walk again but guess what? Never gonna happen. Ever. Fact. Best case scenario, you lose ten grand. Worst case scenario, dead, J. I don't want to go back to Dillon look your family in the eyes and tell 'em I let you do this? Listen, I love you. And I will knock you out and bring your ass back to Dillon if I have to. Okay? Hey, he's gone! Hey, turn the boat around! Turn it around! I can't see him! What were you thinking? I wasn't. I'm sorry. I'm not having the surgery. Let's go back to Texas. Let's go back to Texas. Let's get you up. What are you waiting for? I'm just contemplating how I'm gonna get you in the truck at this point. It's friday night, folks, and what a glorious evening it is.</i> The once beloved, now controversial coach Taylor</i> is back in the driver's seat. On your feet or on your knees, here come the Dillon Panthers.</i> We beat teams like this on the way to the game, okay? They ain't got nothing. Y'all better get ready. Here we go. The second coming of coach Taylor has begun.</i> The Panthers take it in their own end zone.</i> He's up for the twenty, got some room in the outside, pickes up a block</i> and he's out of bounds on the boardings. Good start.</i> You two are sitting on the bench. Weston, Brooks, come here! Folks, look here. Brett Weston starts at quarterback.</i> The tailback will be Calvin Brooks. That means that the hottest duo in texas high school football last year,</i> Matt Saracen and Smash Williams are riding the bench.</i> And that's a coach's decision from Taylor that nobody saw coming.</i> He's sending a clear message to his team, it is his way or the highway.</i> He's got a man open on the right. He fires!</i> Holy cow, was that off! Weston hands off to Brooks. He's got a little lane.</i> Picks up up the inside. He's hit hard. Fumble.</i> And Westerby has got the second play of the game</i> and Dillon's coughed it up. - This is all your fault. - Explain that. This is all your fault 'cause you dis... We went to the coach's house... Hey, you know what? Why don't you two just shut up? You understand me? Shut up! Weston opens left. He's looking down field. He fires!</i> Interception. Touchdown and the Panthers are shot down at the half.</i> With Smash and Saracen benched, you gotta wonder</i> is coach Taylor cutting off his nose to spite his face.</i> Out of all of you, who's got something to say? Someone better have something to say! - Coach, Saracen and Smash... - Sit down. Saracen and smash don't play defense. They don't play special teams. And last time I checked, Saracen and Smash were supposed to be... supposed to be two members of an 11-man offense! Who's got something to say? Maybe the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. - Landry, don't... - Keep it shut, Saracen. - What did you say? - I mean maybe... Speak up! We're a lot stronger together than we're ever gonna be alone. I realize that I'm not... anywhere close to one of the most talented players in this room. And I know... I've never played one real down of football, but I know that we can either win together or we can lose alone. And I know it sounds stupid, but it is an honor just to stand in here with y'all. That's it. - Clear eyes, full hearts... - Can't lose! Let's play some football then! Hand-off to Ellis, he's got a little gap.</i> And he's blocked down by two Panthers, as they show new life here in the second half.</i> - Bring Lance up here. - You mean Landry? - Bring Lance up here. - 85, let's go see coach. - Right up here. - He cannot do it like that. There you go, baby! You're going in next series. Get your helmet on. You're going in next series. You ready? You ready? Where's your helmet? Get your helmet. - Matt, I'm going in. - You... When? Right now. You're going in now? Wait, this game ain't over yet. He's going in? Number 85, Landry Clarke. Coming in to do a little slobber-knocking at tight end.</i> Weston's back to pass. Looking right, he fires. That's another pick. That's two for tonight.</i> Westerby's going the otherway. He's got a lane to the outside. Oh, big hit by number 85. Brooks picks up the loose ball. He's to the 40. He's inside the 30! Touchdown, dillon! That was set up with a tremendous hit by Landry Clarke to jar that ball loose and the Panthers are back in this game. Who's gonna want it more? We gotta do something. We gotta win this game. I guess we could start cheering louder. Maybe start doing this dance. We gotta show coach we put this all behind us and that we're cool again. You just want to tell him that we kissed and made up and now we're good? I shouldn't have rubbed it in your face like that. But I want back in this game! Are you with me? Yeah, man. Let's do it. All right, on-side left! - Hey, Coach, we put it away. We cool. - BFF's once again. Go warm up. 17 seconds left in the game. Down by 5 and the Panthers are gonna have to try an onside kick.</i> And there it is. Westerby's got it... Big hit! Fumble. Ball is loose. And the Panthers pick it up. And Owens goes up down and is lock down at the 18-yard line.</i> Four seconds left in this contest. One more chance for the Dillon Panthers.</i> Coach Taylor is sending in the big guns. This ball has got to be going to Smash Williams, folks.</i> Fresh legs, ready to play, this should be something!</i> Listen up. We're going I-right storm rider Z streak. - Landry's Z, that's the call? - Yeah, that's the call. You good? I'm ready. - Come on, let's get it on! - On one, ready? Break. Here we go, this is the last chance for the Panthers.</i> Saracen drops back to pass. He's got Landry open. He fires the ball across the middle.</i> Landry gets hit, the ball goes down! And that is it. The Dillon Panthers have lost to the Westerby Chaps.</i> Coach Taylor's first game back does not end very well. Hold on.</i> Pass interference. On the defense. The ball on the 2-yard line. We got one on-time down. You cannot end a game on a defensive penalty, folks.</i> The Panthers are gonna have one more crack at the end zone.</i> Here's a hand-off to Williams. - <i>He's up and over!</i> - He's in! He's in! Touchdown, Smash Williams! The Panthers have done it!</i> The Panthers have done it, 20 to 19. Taylor ball is back lead by a fantastic effort from Landry clarke. He stepped up, he sparked this Panther team, and they have won it! Welcome on the team. Thanks, Coach. My baby boy! - This is weird, man! - Fit in. - They're not stopping. - You deserve it. Probably been more amazing if I would've actually caught the ball. But I guess I'll take what I can get. - Okay? - Yeah, no... I don't think we should be together anymore. Okay, and why is that? - People are talking. - That doesn't mean... Look, I'm just trying to protect you. Don't just jump to a conclusion. We need to sit down and talk about this away from here. Do you think if "that" hadn't happened, that there would be a chance in hell that we'd have gotten together? Do you actually think that in a million years? Just take a look in a mirror. I don't know what I was thinking. This is... This is over. I was thinking maybe before the concert, we can get a bit to eat. Grab some pizza or something. Yeah, look, I don't think that I can go to the concert. Panthers, baby! Yeah! Why can't you go to the concert? Because I'm pissed off at you. You cheated on me with the Swede and you wouldn't tell me until I pushed you. And then when that didn't seem to work out, you came back to me as if, that would just be okay. And you never said you were sorry. I am sorry. That might've worked a couple weeks ago. I'm sure you'll find someone else to go to the concert with you. Motel's just up here, but I'm thinking, I'm thinking we get a drink first. Unless of course that's against your religion, Garrity. That's funny, Tim. I gotta go pray. Good game, honey. Wanna fool around? Do you? Yeah. I don't sense true commitment from that answer.
