I just miss all that adrenaline more than anything else. you don't know what you want. You know why? - Why? - 'Cause you haven't lived. A lot more to life than football. Tell you what.

See you tomorrow then. - Bye. - See you later. Mr. Barnett. Can I ask you a question? - Why'd you give my daughter that book? - This? Because it's really funny. It's, uh... a pivotal book... Can we, uh... Let's see if we can... - Let's go in here, okay? - Okay. It's a pretty adult book, don't you think? - It's pretty sexual. - I'm an english teacher here, and I can recommend reading to my students. Well, I find you inappropriate. I'm sorry you feel that way. And I find you condescending. I don't like you giving salacious reading material to my daughter. I don't like you having lunch with her behind closed doors. I don't like you touching each other when you talk to each other. - Look. This is... - No, listen to me. I want you to be clear about something. I can have you fired. I can have my husband come over and beat the crap out of you. And I can have you thrown into prison. You hear what I'm saying? - If you lay one hand on my daughter. - Is that all? - Do you have anything to say? - No, thank you. I don't understand why he wants to meet me. It's creepy. Don't you think it's creepy? What if they're twins? Probably they're not. They're not twins. Why don't you tell him that you're not gonna go? Because I told him I would, and I don't want to look suspicious. What kind of freak wants to meet their brother's rape victim anyway? What does he want? I'm scared, Landry. I don't think I'll be able to look him in the eye. I'll go for you. I'll tell him that you changed your mind. All right? She's going with me, so... Hey. Haven't seen you here in a while. Me and noah were supposed to have lunch together, but I don't know where he is... You haven't heard yet? Your mom got into it with him. - She accused him of all these things. - My mom? She pretty much called him a pedophile. I can't believe you haven't heard. - How dare you? - What? You had no right whatsoever! Not everybody out there is having sex with each other! What are you talking about? You accused Noah of pedophilia in front of the entire school! Sweetie, lower your voice. Why would you do something like that to me? He's the only person who listens to me and you just get him out of my life too? Sweetheart, I'm just your mother I'm just trying to do what I... No, you don't! You don't need to do that as my mother, or as a guidance counselor. or even as a human being, mom! Why would you do that? Somebody's got to look out for you. These people think that meat is something that magically appears in their supermarket wrapped in plastic. But that ain't natural. - You know what I mean? - Yeah, I got you. I mean, if you don't have the stomach to take it down yourself, you better just be eating chicken. I agree. This is awesome, man. Did I tell you? You know what? You're right. It doesn't get any better than this. Doesn't get any better than this. This is one on one. Man versus nature. I just feel free. - You were right. - Lot better than taking a hit, huh? What's so damn funny, man? These girls are bangin', son. You gotta love life, boys. That right there, that's for you. Cloudy, I need that Dom. So you're Smash, huh? Yes, ma'am, that's right, I am. Oh this is a treat, getting my hair done. I want it to look - like Angie Dickinson. - Who's that? She's very famous actress. You don't know who that is? Famous, famous celebrity. Matt, it's Smash. I got somebody here who wants to talk to you. Is this Matt? Tell me, are you as cute as your friend Smash? Look at these people. That hairdo's cute. - That's pretty. - That's real sweet of you to do this. - I can do that. - You could? - You Jeff Caldwell? - Yeah. I'm a friend of Tyra Collette. She's not coming. She didn't want to. Didn't see the point in going back to what happened. I honestly didn't either. Is there something you needed to say? I'd like this to be as brief as you can. Look, if you could, uh... If you could just tell her I'm sorry. I mean, I know that's... Why exactly are you doing this? Just trying to understand how my brother could have done these things. That's not what he was like. One, he was a sick, irredeemable piece of scum. He was a poor excuse of a man. I don't know... I don't know what you don't understand. He wasn't, though. I mean, yeah, obviously with what's happened. yeah, he was, but... I mean, he stuck up for me. Fixed food for me when mom was too drunk. Don't. Please don't tell me about that. You ask anyone in Dillon, they probably got the same story, and they're not off becoming rapist. He was my brother, OK? He's my brother. You know? What's the purpose of your sister even being here if she can't babysit? Honey, what part of the fact that she has class tonight do you not understand? I have to work tonight, but I'm babysitting, aren't I? Well, it's not babysitting when it's your own child, sweetheart. Wait. Why are you putting perfume on? You're going to bunco night. 'Cause I'm trying to mask the smell of spit-up. - That dress looks nice. - Thank you, sweetheart. Sweetie, there's extra breastmilk in the freezer in case she gets thirsty, whatever. I love you. Have fun, have fun. She's your baby. - It's in the freezer? - Thank you. I love you. Bye. Love you. Bye. All right, well... All right, I got it. Roadhouse is the best action movie of the '80s. Hands down, no doubt. At least action movie. Maybe all-time movie. It's got all the key ingredients. Town in need... Man searching for his soul. Hot sex, fisticuffs. Two words: - Patrick... - Swayze. - He's freakin' awesome. - I know. Need you to go in and grab some beer. I think we're out. Go ahead, grab some. A few boxes of cold medicine too. Why am I getting cold medicine at midnight? I got a cold coming on, man. Carlotta. Carlotta. Hello? I'm coming. I baked you some cookies. Great. - Just throw 'em onhe table the. - Okay.

She's so nice. Yeah, she's nice. She's really nice. - Hey. - How did it go? She cried all night. Projectile pooped across the room again. It was hard to clean up. Oh no, did she really? I'm sorry, babe. Did you have a good time tonight? I did. Sorry it was hard for you, though. Those teachers can play some bunco. And I'll tell you what. Glen won $100, and we went out a got a beer. I'm gonna have to pump. - Glenn had a good time. - It was fun. - Give Glenn a great time. - Yeah, it was fun. Honey, you're a little bit jealous of Glenn? Can I tell you something, seriously? I don't like you and Glenn yukking it up in the hallways like a bunch of little kids. Honey... What? Yukking it up? It's goofy. It's goofy? And people are gonna start talking. I don't like y'all running around behind closed doors. Like the other day I walk in there, and he's laying all over the couch there, eating his sandwich and stuff. I have to ask him to leave the room before he even damn sits up. I don't appreciate that. - That's ridiculous. - No, it's not ridiculous. - Yes, it is. - No, you know what it is? It's disrespectful. It's disrespectful to me. It's disrespectful to this family. That's what I'm thinking. What about God? Is it disrespectful to God? That's not funny. - Well, I mean, this is silly. - It's not funny. You know what it is? It undermines us. You think about that. - Just think about it. - It undermines us? Yes, it undermines us. It does not. That is ridiculous. One last thing and we can leave it alone, okay? You need to pay more attention to your family. How dare you? Don't do that. You know what? You can go sleep on the couch. So I can get a good night's sleep so I pay a lot of attention to my family tomorrow. Go on. I'm sleeping. Look, she... She went home. I didn't know that she was coming over. I'm sorry. There's nothing to be sorry for. Go to bed.</i> Smash, this is the way we roll 24/7! What do you think of our little paradise - of a college here? - Call the dogs off. The search is over. - Seriously? - Yeah. - We just found our missing link. - That's right. Let's see what you got, young pup. Look around. See what you like. Go get 'em. Take your shirt off. Let me see your tummy. Oh, God! - Open this door! - Hey, we're kind of busy! - Open the door! - Katrel, take your drunk ass home! Katrell? Katrell Kennedy, the nose guard? - Yes. - Hell, no. Oh, my God. The hell you doing, rookie? I think we got started on the wrong foot! It's not that dramatic! Tell coach you found another school! Hey! Don't ever come back! What the hell took you so long? - I'm freezing. - I got here as fast as I could. - You grab me some clothes? - Here, here. So... So how was your visit? I'm not in the mood. Let's just go. Seriously, was it like cabo in your pant? I never ran so fast in my life. On the real, if they was timing me I'd have ran, like, a 3.8. Yeah, I think that may be the funniest story I've ever heard in my life. Glad somebody finds it funny. Hey, um... Can I ask you a question? Do you know, like, a good way to break up with somebody. I don't know what to say, I've never broken up with a girl a day in my life. Now you're just lying. I'm trying to have a real talk. On the real. I mean, I just tell 'em I want an open relationship. I let that sentence do the work and they break up with me. And I come out smelling out like roses. Open relationship, Matty. Magic words. It's okay, baby. Just give us one second, okay? Okay. Hey, hon. - Thank you, Shel. - Of course, baby. Anytime. See you later, hon. She's really upset. I know. I know she really is. She's embarrassed. I don't think I need a mediator to help me with my daughter, Shelly. I know you think you were right. And honestly, most of the time you are right but in this situation, do you really think that reaming that guy a new one in front of the entire school? You really think that was the best way to handle this? I did not ream that guy... in front of the entire school. - That's what Julie said happened - Well, I'm sure she said that. But you have no idea what really happened. And, you know franckly, you're not a mother. So you have no idea what the situation was that I was in. My God. Sometime, we are gonna have a whole conversation where you don't say that to me. Seriously, Tami, honestly. If mom had done that, how would you have felt? I probably would have felt mortified. Exactly. Thou dost preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies. My cup overflows. Surely goodness and love kindness will follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever and ever. So what does that mean to us? What does that mean to you? Me? That means if we put our trust in the Lord, his promises will... open up to us. We will see his promises. Dors everybody understand? Should we trust God? Should we believe him? Should we put God first? Yes. His promises are right here. Dwell in the land. - Paul, I'll be right back. - Okay. And cultivate faithfulness. Hey, Landry. You okay? Yeah. You look like maybe you needeed some company. I mean, you can sit if you want. Okay. So are you a good christian or a bad christian, Lyla Garrity? I try and be a good christian. So, uh... It's not always so easy to tell, though. I don't think any of us are perfect. I know I'm not. Are you? Not so much. I've had this secret... for a while now, and it's starting to literally just eat away at me. Seems so easy to just tell the truth, to get it all off your chest. To do the right thing. Seems so easy to do. I've got so many people involved in this. I just don't know what to do. I don't think there's anything wrong in telling the truth. I think that... telling the truth is a way of surrendering to God. Man, I don't what would happen if I were to do that. I mean... That's why they call it faith. Just tell the truth, huh? Just tell the truth. Go on, Matty. You can do. Call you guys later. Bye. - How's it going? - Good, you? - Good. - That's good. Can we maybe talk for a minute? Yeah, of course. I was just thinking maybe we should try and have, like... an open relationship. What? Like, an open relationship. Like, you wanna be with another girl? - No, I don't want to. - What did I do? You're perfect, you're great. I told you this about my ex-boyfriend. - It's not like that. - Honestly, don't touch me, okay? Stay out of my way, Matt. Okay? Okay. See? Problem solved! What happened to coming out smelling like roses? That part don't always work. Yeah, has it ever worked out? You ever seen that work out? Like how I decorated? Good thing you're a cool dude. Or I'd have to kill you. Let's go! Let's hear it now! Spread 'em. Stretch it out good, gentlemen. Lean it, lt! Coach. To the right. What the hell are you doing? What the hell are you doing in my uniform? It's still my uniform, coach. What the hell are you doing in my uniform and my field, Riggins? - I'm not getting off the field, Coach. - You're not? You're get off my damn field if I tell you to. I'm not leaving. I'll do whatever it takes to stay on this field. You didn't just let me down, you let yourself down, you let the damn team down. You understand that? All right, then. Get off my damn field. Let's go! Six! Call it out! Let's go! What'd I tell you? Get out of here. I can't hear you! Left over right. Hang it! What the hell you think you're going? What's up, Rig? We have not playing since pee-wee, and I let you down. And I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Thanks, Rig. I appreciate it. 4-6. Hey, look, I don't ever recall seeing you play in any of the games. I don't think you ever will. But I can tell you, the effort you put forth on practice days is undeniable. Thanks, man. 2-0. You know, to be honest, I just... I know you try and sleep with a lot of girls that I've previously slept with so just left town for a bit to give you a break. You know? You lose that virginity yet? We're good, man. It's good to have you back. I, uh... I apologize to eveyone here. And if you can find it within yourselves to let me make it up to you in the showers. I appreciate it. Listen up. Your penance isn't paid up yet. Wipe that stupid smile off you face. Go take your spot. Let's go! Come on! Call 'em out, let's go. Get out of my spot, rookie. Bring it up! - Hi. - Hi. Where's everyone? Julie and Shelly took baby Grace to the mall to buy her some new baby clothes. Which is very sweet. That's good. I can't not have a friend at school that I, you know, spend time what, for 20 minutes a day. It's not about Glen. Don't give a damn about Glen. I'm supposed to be the one that you're yukking it up with in the hallways. I'm supposed to be the one that you're laughing with. I Miss you. I Miss you too. I like you. - You do? - Yeah, I like you. I like you too. I broke up with Lauren. I don't know why you're telling me uhis, Matt. Because she was really nice and really hot and I had absolutely no reason not to like her. Except that I can't stop thinking about you. Look, I know you work here, and I'm not trying to make anything weird, but I like you, a lot. And I just want to spend every second I can with you or around you. I just want you to know that. - Look, I... - No. I need to speak to someone about the murder of Mike Caldwell.
