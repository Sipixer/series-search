It's your dad... He was killed. I'm sorry. Are you all right? I'm fine. This Friday's game between the East Dillon Lions and the McNulty Mavericks</i> promises to be a barn burner, At least on one side of the ball. McNulty is the favorite to upset the Panthers' reign this year,</i> and their undefeated record has them in prime position</i> for that playoff spot. You got to wonder how fast and how often</i> this McNulty offense is gonna score on this poor Lions' defense.</i> Flip the TV on for this one... You hear that, man? You one sorry, brother. - You know that, Vince? - Go ahead. I mean, it's one thing to be on the team that sucks. It's a whole other thing to be on a team that suck on TV. Everybody watching too? - Shut up. - Couldn't be me. That's why I quit that sorry-ass team. You know what I'm saying? McNulty's averaging 53 points a game. They got the second ranked offense in the state. Coach, they've only punted twice the whole damn season. Friday, we are gonna keep it simple. These are offensive plays. "Offensive," Stan. - "Offensive" plays. - Listen up now. McNulty's undefeated. Game's televised. It's a game-changer. I don't like it. That's what I'm talking about. What we're gonna do is we're gonna go down to the field with the media. We're gonna talk briefly with the reporters. Let's keep it simple. I'm not finished. Wait, wait, wait. I totally just remembered something. Oh, no. What? You're pregnant? You are, aren't you? I'm having twins actually, but they're aliens. I don't want twins. So I bought these tickets for the Austin Indie Music Festival, and it was supposed to be a surprise but... - But then my dad died. - Yeah. I can give 'em to Devin or something. We ought to go. - Are you sure? - Yeah. And you know what? Actually someone gave me, like, this grieving handbook thing, and chapter two said, "When your dad dies, "you should most likely probably go to a music festival, preferably in Austin." - You're such a liar. - I'm not a liar. - Are you sure you're gonna be okay? - I'll be fine. Look, he's... He's dead, all right? And I'm... I'm alive. So let's go. Hey, guys. How you doing? Hey, Mike. How are you? What are your goals going into this game? Goals going to the game? We'd like to stop their offense, put a few holes in their defense. How do you intend to measure that success? We're gonna use the scoreboard to measure that success. What do you hope to accomplish there? What do you want the score to reflect? I would like for the score to reflect that we left everything on the field that we had. - So you're gonna win this game? - Well, what I'm saying is... We can win and we will win. - Are you guaranteeing a victory? - I am guaranteeing a victory. We got to start practice, okay? Get these fine young men out here who are gonna put their blood on the field! Becky, come on... Nice place. It's something. - So I saw you at the funeral. - Yeah, I saw you too. Thought you'd be back by now. Midterm break. I stayed to see my dad. That's nice. "That's nice." That's it? It's not nice? Oh, you are something, huh? You stop calling, you disappear... That's nice. My dad says you threw away the scholarship. I did. I'm so glad I came over. 4x06: STAY Subtitles: Team Lions With the participation of: Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb, Jenn, Ju, Nam, ouazo Mom! It's two days. It's not a week! It is two nights in Austin during exams? Absolutely not! It's a ridiculous thing. You haven't been accepted into college. So if I would have gotten into college, this would be a conversation because... If you had passed your exams already and you had gotten accepted into 3 schools early decision then, yes, you can go to Austin, Texas, on two school nights and enjoy a music show. Yes, I think in that situation, I'd be all right with it. Matt's dad just died, mom. I'm not gonna dignify that with even a response. - Come on, Jules. - What's going on? Dad, can I go to the music festival with Matt? Hi, sweet girl. The music festival in the middle of the week in Austin, Texas, sweetheart. No, I don't think you're gonna be going to Austin with Matt. You guys are awful! Look, Matt, I'm sorry. You should be, man. You suck. I been working with you a lot lately... That is not what I was talking about. I was talking about your dad, so thanks. I know. I know. You know they... - They're giving us a death gratuity? - A what? Death gratuity? Yeah, it's, like, $100,000. Does it come in a tip jar? They just... I guess they tack it on with the... life insurance policies, so grandma's... - She's set up for the rest of her life. - That's good. What about you? What about me? I don't know. How are you doing, I guess? I'm fine, man. I don't understand why people keep asking me how I'm doing. I'm fine. People keep saying, "Are you okay?" I don't really know what to say in this situation. You don't have to say anything. It's over with. We took care of it, and now we're just throwing a football. Is that okay with you? I'm really start to get the feeling that you just want to fight. I don't know if you want me to give you some kind of big speech. I don't know what it is that you want me to do. But I'm not gonna do that. I don't care what you do. But either way, I'm gonna be your best friend, 'cause you've been my best friend since we were five. Yeah, all right. Hey, honey. Hey, y'all. - Oh, messages, messages? - Of course. Of course. The PTA meeting has been changed to Friday the 28th. Clint wants you to meet the new hire for AP Spanish, and Mrs. Corrigan called to request that her son be moved out of calculus. - Her number's here. - Okay, thank you so much. And your daughter called and she said for you not to worry about anything. She'd see you on Saturday. Wait. What was that? Yeah, she said... She said she was going to Austin. - She did? - Called 15 minutes ago, maybe. All right. Could you just get that door? Thank you very much. Julie, this is your mother calling. I just got the strangest message from the secretary in the office that you have gone to Austin, which I know cannot be true, considering the fact that both your father and I told you that you couldn't go to Austin. So you had best call me back right away. Thank you very much. Hello, stranger. So look, I think... I think the best thing to do here in this situation is just to be completely mature about all this. You know? And first off, I just want to say kissing you was great. You know? That was great. You're great. So just know that bottom line, you know? Well, you see, there's this part of me that's like maybe we should just kind of see where it goes, see what happens, not really think about it too much. Then there's this other really, really kind of tiny part of me that's still hung up on this other girl, Tyra, who's, like, embedded in the back of my mind. So I think the mature thing... I really didn't see that coming. Will I see you later? Like when? Five minutes. Maybe three. I go back to school in three days. You go back to school in three days. See, I don't know if you know this, but I'm kind of a moment-to-moment kind of guy, so three days... - I can work with that. - What does that mean exactly? I could probably tell you, but... I'm dying to know. Showing you might be even better. I can show you what it means to work with it. They're sharp, I know. - How you doing? - I'm good. Good. I'll miss you. I know you're in there. Just 'cause there's a girl at my door, I don't have a girlfriend. You're not ignoring me, right? Because I just want to let you know that I'm not gonna jump on you every time I see you. Yeah, I was just gonna ask for a ride to school, but... it's cool, I know you're busy. I'll see you later. That was... the landlord's daughter. How are you gonna play? We've been through the storm and the rain. We fixing to bring the pain. Well, Emily, I think, you know, I scored a perfect score on my math portion of the S.A.T. so, you know, if the pressure's on, I think I'm the guy to go to. Do you have anything more to say about that guaranteed win? Well, I'm more of the brains... and brawn. I got it all. I'm the total package. Are you gonna win? Coach, could we talk about your history of quitting, first with the Panthers back in '06, and more recently, forfeiting your first game as head coach of the Lions? Don't know why you come out here and waste people's time with this. This is romantic. Nice breeze. It's perfect. Good sandwiches. Good sandwiches that I put my heart and soul into. It's hard making peanut butters. Your phone is ringing. It's just Devin. I'll call her back later. You sure? We're having our romantic picnic right now, okay? That's right. Wait. Excuse me, miss. Can I get some service, please? Excuse me, miss? Can I get some menus over here and some service? Thank you. I'm sorry. Vince, you really need to go away. - I can't get some food? - It don't make no sense you being here. Why not? You know your dad got the best ribs in town. What you want? Hey, Mr. Merriweather. I was talking to your daughter Jess. About to order some baby back ribs. - You can get that over at the counter. - I was gon' sit here and eat it... Get your ass over to the counter. Yes, sir. Here. It was a pleasure talking to you, Jess. I'll see you around to school. Hey, it's the girl who loves her candy. Got you some gummy bears. Our little thing the other night, that was a mistake, okay? That was a big mistake. And I would really appreciate it if you didn't try to treat me like a girlfriend, and I don't need you buying me stuff. I don't want anything from you. Especially not for you to talk about me to your football buddies. I didn't say anything to my football buddies. I'll bet you didn't. Just forget it. We just don't have to talk at all anymore, okay? Sorry. I just... I think you're cute and I would really love to go out again sometime, but... I must be... I don't know. Sorry. Julie, I know that you probably do not think this is a big deal, but I assure you this is a gigantic deal. You had best turn around from wherever you are and get yourself home, and you answer the phone when I call you! You are my favorite daughter. Be right back, sweetie. Five, six, seven, eight... Wait, no. You know what? I think we should go... Because that would add more energy... No, come on. Seriously, it's fine. Is fine okay for TV? 'Cause if y'all okay with fine, we can stop right now. Five, six, seven, eight. Bring it in, guys. Let's go. Here we go, here we go. Listen up. Who can tell me McNulty's record? - Yeah, they never lost. - That's right, but we're gonna change that. Here's how we're gonna do it. We're gonna play 11 on offense today, but we are gonna do 13 on defense. Because if you can punch one hole into 13, you damn well ought to be able to punch 2 holes into 11. Understood? Yes, sir. We got Tim and Billy coming over to help. You boys ever played a couple state champions? - Here we go! - Show 'em your ring, Tim. All the guys in yellow on defense, over there, huddle 'em up. We feel good! How you guys feel? - Let's go! - Here we go! Let's go! Strong red, strong red! - You was open on that one? - I got hit before I got the ball. Guy's all over the place. So fast... All right, let's do it. - It's like playing against a wall. - I know. I can feel it. - We're not ready for this. - Here we go. - Copeland, you got to respond to that! - They're getting there. Touchdown! - Love it. - Good job. Seriously, I'm telling you right now, if we had to play a game tomorrow I would be a madman. - So here's what I want. - I was running... - Just stop talking about football. - How's being pregnant? It's great. She thinks her water's gonna break every 15 minutes. Really? I mean, I know you have the belly, but not the baby cause she asked <i>me</i> what it was like to be pregnant. You could thank me for always being your designated driver. I thank you constantly. I do constantly, baby. Cause I love you. It's true. - What? - Y'all know what I miss? Getting on that bull and letting off some steam. - I'd ride that bull. I would. - No, you shouldn't. - Not a good call. - It's totally a good call. Don't get on the death ride. - I'm riding the bull. - Yeah, you are. - What'd you just do? - She's amazing. - Can I go next? - Sure, little lady. This might not end well. Oh, my god... I'm ready! She's pretty good. - That's very smooth. - You missed me. You have no idea. See you later. All right, buddy. - Take it easy, all. Bye. - Landry! Hey, Landry. How are you doing? - Good. - Good to see you. - Good to see you at East Dillon. - I know. Well, I had to drop off something for coach. - Rushing off to my school. - Right. Have you talked to Matt and Jules since they've gone off on their big trip to Austin? - No, not since they left. - Yeah. Listen, I'm just gonna be real straightforward with you. My daughter's awol, I'm sick about it, and if you could shed any light on where they are and when they're gonna be there, it would be real helpful to me. I don't know obviously their whole schedule... I think they were planning on seeing <i>The Heartless Bastards</i> At Emo's tomorrow night. - That's good to... - Like 7:30 or 8 or something. But other than that... And you know where they're staying? Are you going? Are you gonna go visit? No, but I just... I'm a mother. All right, I'll have to get over to my school now, but... - Okay. - Nice to see you. - It was good to see you. - Thank you. - Becky, right? - Yeah. I'm Lyla. - Yeah, I remember. - Is Tim around? No, I haven't seen him. So you're in college, right? Is it great? Yeah. It's pretty cool. - Guess I've been homesick lately. - For Dillon? Yeah, I didn't expect that either. Did you come back cause you miss Tim? I really don't know what I'm doing here. You go away to college and... You think you're getting over this thing 'cause being away helps with that. But... Now I'm here and here we are. I'll tell Tim you stopped by. You're so lucky. So pretty. This is the McNulty film. I want you to watch it together. Understood? - Yes, sir. - All right, good. - Anything confusing about that? - Where? Wherever you can find out. Would you step out so I can see the TV? Okay. - Why do we have to get killed on TV? - I don't know what we're gonna do. Gotta do something. - Look who it is. - Look who it is. - What are you doing? - Seriously? - Watching game tape? In sears? - What's it look like, genius? Funny. I'm surprised you haven't stolen one of these. Dude, shut up. Got a problem? Nah, but I can get one real quick. Can I help you boys? Yeah. Why don't you get the hell out of my department and my store? - For what? - Cause I'm one jackass comment away from doing some serious damage. And if that happens, I would lose my job... And I love my job. You get me? Let's go. Let's go, man. See ya. From the east side. Coach, I didn't even know. What's up? Down. - Look for the gaps. - Yes, sir. - Get off the bedspread. - What? They don't wash it. There's, like bugs that live in it. Get off. Okay, sorry. Get some kind of disease. - Jesus. - There. Now you can sit down. Would you like to dance? - Are you being serious? - Yeah, it's pretty music. Mr. Romance. Shut up. Stop ruining the moment. - I am not ruining the moment. - Shut up and enjoy it. We're in a hotel dancing. - This is real romantical. - It's beautiful. Look, we're in Austin. It's the capital. Thanks for coming back. You're welcome. I can't believe my son gon' be on TV. Yeah, your son's gon' get his butt whooped on TV too. You don't know that. I got to find something to wear. Wear for what? To the game. You don't got to come all the way up to McNulty just to see me lose. Selena said she'd drop me off. Look, I need to see you play. - I do. - Okay. I won't make no scenes or nothing. I'll be cleaned up. I'm going to Austin tomorrow. - You're what? - I'm going to find our daughter. - Listen, babe... - I don't care that she is 17. She bald-faced lied to us. Not asking our permission. We told her not to go. We expressly said "Do not go to Austin", and she went off without telling us. Even though we told her not to go, she's there. - You can't find her in a festival. - She's not answered one of my calls. I have no idea where she is. She has not called us. She could be... I have no idea if she's okay. I am concerned. I can't think of another thing right now. Can't focus on anything, so I'm gonna go to Austin to find her. - And I support your decision 100%. - Thank you, babe. It's so darn selfish. But more importantly... More importantly, Riggins Rigs, granted, it's not doing so well. I understand that hence me in the trailer now. That will change. So give me six months, a year. He's got his kid and all this stuff. It's gonna get busy. I'm pitching away, doing my thing. Handing out cards. All this stuff. It's gonna get super busy. I'll be under that car all the time. That's where you come in, Miss Garrity. We're gonna need someone to manage it when it gets, like, super busy. Granted, yeah, it's a simple life, but it's kind of a great life. - That's your pitch? - Yeah. Take that. - That's a hard one to walk away from. - So don't. - Tim... - I'm serious. - What do you want? - You. What else do you want? You. Hey, what's wrong? What's going on? Why would she do that? Scare us to death like that? I trust Julie. I trust Matt. And I know that she's safe anywhere, all right? I don't know that. I don't know at all that she's safe. She has not returned one phone call. I don't know why she would do that. Because she's 17 years old. That's why. Just breaks my heart. The more we make her try to stay, the more she's gonna stray. I know, but I hate it. I don't want her to go. But I know she's gonna go and... I don't want her to. You're not going, are you? To Austin? Seems kind of silly, I guess. I'm just gonna beat her ass when she gets home. - Hello? - Hey, Matt. How you doing? Yeah, no, it's good. We saw <i>Him </i>yesterday and we're about to go see The Heartless Bastards tonight. That sounds like a lot of fun. Just a kind of a FYI. Miss Taylor kind of cornered me at school yesterday and started drilling me with these questions about where you and Julie might be. Wait, what? And I kind of panicked and told her that you were going to the concert, Which, now thinking back, I might not should have done. Just wanted to give you the heads-up. It's probably fine.</i> - Wait, she doesn't know... - <i>I'm sure</i> she's not gonna come to Austin or anything. But I wanted to let you know. - <i>So there it is.</i> - She doesn't know we're in Austin? Great. I think I'm gonna go cause I just let another cat out of the bag. - <i>I guess I'll talk to you later. Bye.</i> - Thanks. Aren't you ready? You lied to your parents? - I didn't lie to my parents, Matt. - Okay, cause that was Landry and he said that your mom was interrogating him about where you were. I told them I was gonna be in Austin. I left them a message. You left them a message. That's good. Look, you're blowing it out of proportion. It's really... It's a big deal, cause I actually care what your parents think about me. I don't want them to hate me, which is what's gonna happen if they think that I ran away to Austin with you. I told them where I was gonna be and sorry, I did this to make you happy. I bought the tickets so you could get out of Dillon, because you hate it. I don't hate Dillon. I don't know what you're talking about. You hate Dillon. You only stay because of me and I don't want the responsibility of you having to stay in Dillon. Look, hey. I'm sorry, okay? I didn't... I didn't mean to freak out. So let's just go see this concert, all right? - I'm sorry too. I didn't mean to yell. - No, that's fine. It's fine. Yeah. Folks, we are just one hour away from kickoff.</i> McNnulty's rolling in an undefeated, top-ranked team versus the Lions,</i> a team that has yet to name a quarterback.</i> Coach Taylor's put this team together with spit</i> and scotch tape, and tonight, this monumental mismatch</i> is gonna be captured on television. It's a beautiful night for football, folks.</i> Vince Howard in shotgun. Let's go, O! Cafferty goes in motion. There's the snap. It's a speed sweep going...</i> Howard keeps it going right. Got a lane! This could be something, folks!</i> Oh, and he trucks the quarterback. First down to the 41. Roll Lions.</i> Coach Taylor's moving Luke Cafferty under center for the snap.</i> It's a little speed draw. Lanes are up the middle. Got some room...</i> Oh, nice run by Luke Cafferty! The Lions, believe it or not, got a little something-something going, folks.</i> No one saw this coming, but this could turn out</i> to be one hell of a football game. East Dillon Lions in the red zone. This could be big, folks! Howard at quarterback...</i> There's the snap. Howard takes off in a little speed draw up the middle.</i> Got a little room! This kid's got something. Oh, my goodness. A touchdown, East Dillon Lions!</i> Touchdown! East scores, and that is the first touchdown</i> McNulty has given up in four games. It looks like the East Dillon Lions have found</i> an identity, folks, and quite possibly</i> - <i>a quarterback that is the real deal.</i> - Yeah! Here we go! Late in the second half.</i> These Lions have battled these Mavericks all night long,</i> and they are just seven points away from tying this game up!</i> Something no one, including yours truly,</i> thought was even remotely possible. Good job! Good job! Howard takes the snap, he rolls left...</i> Pressure coming! Upfield, go! This could be big, folks! Inside the ten-yard line... First down, Lions. Get your ass up. Let's go! Let's go, let's go! Howard takes the snap... - Right there, right there! - <i>Under pressure. Great spin move.</i> Howard's trying to make a play! He's gonna have to get rid of the ball!</i> Oh, and he gets pasted, in the back field, the clock winds out,</i> and the upset is not to be, folks. - Get off me, man. - <i>We have seen a team emerge tonight,</i> lead by a young quarterback, Vince Howard,</i> - <i>the rising star of the Lions.</i> - Hey, let's go. Bring it in. Let's go. Here we go. Come on, fellas. Let's go. Hey, listen to me. Listen, everyone. Listen up right now. Every single person out here... Every single person out here respects you fellas. Every one. I respect you. You need to respect yourselves. Hell of a job. Hell of a job. Take that with you, carry it, and we're gonna build on it. - Hey, do you want to leave? - No, they just started playing. No, do you want me to leave? Maybe you were right. I mean, maybe... I should have left already. Do you even want me to stay? Of course I want you to stay! I was just... I was saying stupid things. I'm sorry! I love you, okay? I'm sorry! I was being stupid! Don't think about it, okay? Okay. I love you! I love you. Morning. Morning. Good-bye, Lyla Garrity. Good-bye. Really cool festival. Thank you. I'm glad you had a good time. It was nice just to get away with you. I love you, Julie. I love you, Matty. I better go. I'll see you later? That better have been a great concert, babe. I'm sorry... Well, we have been worried sick. Sorry. I'm sorry. What happened, hon? Did something happen? I think he's leaving. It's okay. - That's good. That's better. - Is it better? Let me move these and you watch and see if those lines come off. Do you really think we need a new tv? Look, this is working just fine. It might be something to invest in. Well, that's... Ooh, that is... go back. Let's watch that channel, - 'cause it looks better. - Alright, I don't really care. And I guess we could think about getting a new tv. Lorraine, you'd *be* shocked. - Would we want to get a bigger screen? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. How's Lyla? Gone. Do you have a broken heart? I don't know. Is she the love of your life? Maybe there's more than one soul mate for everybody, you know? 'Cause, like, say I'm born in Texas, right? And my soul mate's born all the way over in Sri Lanka. That seems randomly unfair. It only makes sense if there'd be more than one. You know, 'cause you have your first, and it's new, and you feel... things that you never thought you'd feel and they break your heart. Then you cry about it, and you're sad over it... And then you meet someone else. And for that time, they're your new soul mate, because... they made you feel things the other one couldn't. And then they break your heart. Becky...
