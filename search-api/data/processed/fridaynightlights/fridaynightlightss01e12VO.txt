Waverly? Damn girl, look. I don't know where you been, but time's sure been good to you. You said if we were gonna sue anybody, it was gonna be the school, Dad. - You said nothing about Coach Taylor. - Jason. Take it easy, okay? This was not Coach Taylor's fault. Coach Taylor did not make that tackle. I did. - What did I tell you about using the stove? - What? You're acting like a damn child. Calm down, it's just-- it was an accident. Are you okay? It's okay. I don't even know what happened. I thought you were gonna come home from Iraq and actually be able to help, but you've only made things worse. - Now get in the truck. - Go to hell, Dad. Well, it is just a couple of more days</i> until the future of Dillon football is determined by the outcome of the Buckley-Arnett Mead game.</i> Buckley's star running back, Denny, is hotter than a pistol right now, folks.</i> And if he can help his team overcome powerhouse Arnett Mead,</i> that means our Panthers will be in the playoffs.</i> It all comes down to Friday night, Panther fans.</i> The hog's out of the gate, the clock is ticking, and it is on. We are not gonna sit on our asses to wait and see if Buckley beats Arnett Mead this Friday or not, gentlemen. We're gonna stay focused, and we're gonna stay working. Some things you can control. Some things you cannot. Time, you cannot control. Time's our enemy. I do not want y'all driving yourselves crazy this week. What happens, happens. Ain't no spell or no bag of juju gonna change that. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna stay out here and we're gonna work our asses off. If the good Lord and/or Buckley defense decides we should get one more shot at this thing, well, by God, we're gonna be ready for it. Arnett Mead's got Johnson. Everybody say he's one of the best QBs in the state, but he can't win a game by himself. The way I see it, Buckley need to play Denny. He had three sacks last Friday. He's cold-blooded. Ain't got nothing on me, but he cold-blooded. Hey, where you going? I got a trumpet needs polishing. She gonna try to play me. She don't even get it. She don't even get it. Buckley's got to make them spread the defense. Not be so one-dimensional. That's the only way they got a chance. Well, I'll tell Coac- Oh, shoot. Damn it. I'll get it. I'm sorry. She making any sense at all? Think Arnett Mead could possibly lose? They're favored by a lot, but Buckley does have Denny. I mean, he can be surprising. He can just break a game open, so... Well, I hope Denny kicks Arnett Mead's ass. 'Cause I'd like to see you QB in that playoff game. You won't even be here then, anyway. Denny, Denny's good. Actually, I will. I'm not gonna go back to Iraq. He's been good a long time. I'm gonna stay here with you and Grandma. Really? Yeah. If that's all right with you. Yeah, that's fine. All  right. Spread the defense! I got you spreading the defense-- Arnett Mead tries to key on Denny, eight in the box. Honey? Will you just think about something else? What do you want me to think about? There's things going on in the world. You could think about... - the little children in... - Oh, my heavens. India... You know what, there is nothing else to think about. Oh, baby. There is nothing else to think about. You can think about how much you love me. That's a good idea. Why wouldn't you think about that? Coach Eric Taylor? - Hi. - Yeah? - What's this? - You've been served. Served by who? Jason Street's family. What? That was it. Uh, hey, Coach. Uh, you think old Buckley's got a shot against Arnett Mead? Friday Night Lights - 1x12 What to Do While You're Waiting Transcript: Raceman Sync: Tauri41 ..:: www.forom.com ::.. I can't believe they would sue us. You raised Jason Street. You raised him on that football field. How could they possibly blame you for what happened? Oh, it's-- it's one of those things. You can't make it personal. They were probably advised to do it by lawyers. It's what people do now. It's what they do. We're covered by the school, and it's... It's not personal. You just gotta look at it that way. - Mmm... - That's just what people do. Ah. Morning, Clint. How you doing today? Busy. Got a big game Friday night. I got some interesting theories on Arnett Mead, if you-- if you got some time to talk about it. Can't shoot the bull today. I've got a lot of work waiting in the back. Okay, I'll just, uh... I'll leave the money on the counter. Are--are we asking if Grandma's tests are covered under-- under the F1 provision? No,  'cause I think the F1, it only covers the bloodwork. I mean, I can't make heads or tails of any of this. So how's the, uh, job hunt going? Not really a boom town here, Matt. Hold  on. Yes, I need to speak to somebody about my mother's coverage? Name is Lorraine Saracen. Jason Street should not be suing the Panthers. Why not, Bob? 'Cause they've done so much for him? What, they bought him some flowers, gave him a football, threw him some lame-ass pancake supper. You know, I'm sure that just about covers everything. Well, look who it is. Tyra the mouth. Your money, honey, is on the counter for lunch. - Honey? Honey. - Yes, uh... Seen these jeans your daughter's wearing? - What? - You okay with these? What? Man, you ladies have a genetically superior ass. It runs in this family. - Bye, Mom. I'm leaving. - Oh, bye. - I'll see you later. - Okay. I'm telling you, I was at Clint's store and he wouldn't even look me in the eye. I told you that this was going to happen. Now it's in the papers? It's done, it's done. On top of being the crippled kid, - now everyone's just gonna hate me. - Jason... Thanks a lot. - You knew we had no choice. - You had it. You don't go against the Panthers in this town and you know that. Jason, you knew this was gonna happen. And I said it was a bad idea! All right. Jason... Honey. I'm your mother. And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for you. To give you what you need to survive right now, we need money. I'm just... I've come to terms with the fact that there are people in this town who aren't gonna understand that. I'm... I am so sorry I have to put you through this. - Mom... - You have no idea-- You have no idea. - I mean... - It's okay, I'm not-- Coach should've put you through tackling drills, right? He should've done that. I'm sorry, honey. May--maybe he should've. Maybe he should've. Everybody in? All right, listen up. Little issue has come to my attention, gentlemen. The annual Women's Booster League Rodeo Fundraiser and Fair. - Shut up, shut up. - Hey, hey, hey. I know y'all would rather be sweating out game night by yourselves instead of being at the rodeo. So would I. But you know what? These women work hard. It's a good cause. So we are all gonna show our asses up there with smiles on our faces. Now let's go have some fun. Oh, really? That game... Hang on just a second. Matt Saracen. - Hey, Mr. Garrity. - How you doin', son? - I'm doing all right. - What can I do for you? - Well, if you're busy, I don't want to-- - Wait a minute. That's all right. Roger, Roger. Take care of that for me. I'll be right back. Are you sure? I really didn't want to interrupt you... - Oh no, no, nonsense, son. - Okay. Those are just people. You're my quarterback. Okay. My dad's decided to stay here in Dillon and not go back to Iraq. So that I--I can stay here, and I don't have to move to Oklahoma with my aunt. Well, that's damn good. We'd hate to lose you. Thanks. Well, anyway, since-- Since he's not gonna be working in Iraq, he needs to be working here. And--and there's not a lot of work here. So I was just curious if maybe you... If you know of anything. That--or-- Have  any suggestions, maybe. Well, Matt... I'll tell you what you do. If you will send your dad over to me, I can put him to work immediately. You know, I probably-- I could use a new salesman. Our sales are going through the roof right now. You send your daddy over to me, and I'll take care of him. - How's that sound? - Are you-- Th-- - thank you so much, Mr. Garrity. - Oh, you're welcome, son. - Come back and see me. - I will, I will. Yeah. Hey, you like to hunt? All right. Oh hey, listen. I was just gonna let you know, your bill's up to about $294.04. So you can bring a check in sometime, that'd be great. - Thanks. - All right. Bye. Hey, Mitch. Can I talk to you a minute? Eric, man, I am so sorry. I don't know who it was behind this. I know it's not you. - I-I just didn't know what else to do, man. - I understand You know, I-- Hey, listen, when I got served the papers, I said, "I know this isn't coming from Mitch and Joanne. I know it's not." Expenses are astronomical, Coach. - Look, I understand. - Eric-- You probably realize, too, it's not a great idea to get yourself involved in a lawsuit that's gonna cause you that much additional pain. And you know this is gonna get you nowhere. I'm not so sure that's the case. Well, hell, Mitch, what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? You're gonna sue the school? What are you gonna prove? That the school was negligent? And how the hell are you gonna do that? I was there. You were there. - Everybody was there. - I can't talk to you about this. Mitch, it was a horrible accident, but it was nobody's fault. - It was nobody's fault. - I cannot talk to you about this. You think this is tough for you? You wanna try losing your child's legs and losing your child's future and every penny that you ever saved. Try that on for size. And then after that, try- try finding where in the hell you're gonna come up with money to put up the ramps and doorways all over your house, and  pay for the unending equipment and physical therapy. Hell, I don't want to sue anyone. It's killing me to do this. But since I'm already dead... It doesn't matter anyway, now does it? Just get the hell out of here, Coach. Get out of here. Hey,I don't know anything about selling cars - Hello, Matt! - Hey, Mr. Garrity. - How are you, son? - This is my dad, Hen--Henry Saracen. - Henry, very nice to meet you, sir. - Very nice to meet you. - Welcome to Garrity Motors. - Thank you. We are very proud to have our very own quarterback's dad on our team. I can tell you that right now. - Well, I appreciate that. - You bet. Just step back here and we'll set you all up. Easy as pie. Matt, take a look at some cars. - Test-drive one if you want to. - Yeah, okay. This way, Henry. I--let me tell you, this is really, really simple. And we got a friendly, friendly place. Lot of people I think you'll enjoy working... Hey, Waverly. How's the tuba looking? Bright and shiny like your forehead. And it's a trumpet. How's the endless speculation of who's gonna win that game you guys were talking about going? Yeah, well, it's not like my whole life don't hang in the balance. Is that why you walked out on me at the diner yesterday? I didn't walk out on you. You weren't talking to me, anyway. I was sitting right next to you. That is so not the same thing. All right, look. Look, I know you been gone a while. But there's a few rules about what's right and what's wrong that you need to know. Number one, don't nobody walk out on Smash. Oh, good. The return of the third person. You know, as fascinating as it is to sit there and listen to everyone talk about how great you are, the Waverly has better things to do. What's wrong with you, girl? You know you like me. I do like you. I just... I don't think we have anything in common. Yeah, we do. Look, you tell me what you want to have in common, and I'll get it in common. Come on, work with me, girl. I'm trying here. All right. Um...is there anything about you that isn't football 24/7? Hell, yeah. - Uh... - Anything else that you talk about? Do you have any other friends that... Matt Saracen and Julie Taylor. We chill all the time. Talk about a whole mess of stuff besides football. I mean... Immigration, Iraq... books, music. Stem cell research. Global warming. You name it. In fact, I'm going to the rodeo with them on Friday. You should come along. See what I mean. All right. We'll give the Waverlash one last try. The Waverlash? That's what you called it? Oh, that Smash mouth contagious, girl. Matt, sweetie? Don't forget about my tea. I know, I won't, Gran-- The water's almost ready there. You know, I hate for you to wait on me, but I promised y'all I wouldn't mess with that stove. Oh, shoot. Um, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I've been sitting at the library for an hour. And that's my fault. And I apologize. It's just that my-- My grandma called, and she thought that there was this really big mouse in the house, so I came home, and then this whole place was sort of a mess. So I started cleaning it up. And then I remembered that I had to get dinner ready - before my dad gets home, - Matty, I sure could use that tea. and I gotta make tea for my grandma. It's on its way, Grandma. - Um, so I gotta be-- - Okay, how about you make dinner and I'll make your grandma some tea? - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, thanks. Would now be a bad time to tell you that I told Smash that we'd double-date with him and Waverly and we'd pretend that we do that a lot, and we talk about all sorts of neat stuff besides football? - I heard you! - The last time you went out with this loser, you were gone for three days. - I won't have that again-- - All right, all right, all right! No! - I said no. You heard me. - No? What the hell is the matter with you? Are you telling me when I can and can't leave this house? - It has nothing to do-- - Are you high? Bob, it has nothing to do with that-- You know why people leave you? Because you drive people crazy! Put a bullet in my head. Get  out of my way! Get out of my way! - Don't you dare touch her. - Tyra! Get the hell away from her! Get the hell out! Don't you ever touch my mother again. I will kill you! I'll kill you! Get the hell out! You understand? Do you understand me? Get out, get out. Get out, get out. Do it! Do it! Get out of here! Do it. - Get out, get out. - Do it. Get out, get out. Get out. Oh, my God. Hey, babe. I love you guys. And you guys are the best parents in the world. Good night. No, honey. Something terrible must've happened. Julie? There's no adult looking out for him. I mean, it's crazy. He's just by himself, doing the cooking, and the cleaning, the shopping. He takes care of his grandma. His dad's been home for two weeks, and there's still a table full of insurance forms for his grandma. And he has school, and work, and football. I just... I feel like it's just gonna crush him. Nothing's going to crush Matt Saracen. He's like a little stinkbug. You can't crush him. He's tough. He'll be fine. Well... I do think it is an awful lot for one 16-year-old to have to handle. I might be able to do something. I don't know. Have him come see me at school. Okay. Thanks, Mom. Good night. Good night. You're the best. What do you mean, she's the best? What about me? Hey! Aren't you gonna get up? I don't think he's coming back. God, Mom, he's just a stupid guy. It's not like Jesus Christ just left you. I'm just not used to being alone. But you're not alone. You got me. Nice, Henry. Bagged 'em. Oh... God. Where'd they go? I thought they were ready to take delivery when I handed them to you. Well, it turned out it wasn't a good time for them, financially. Henry... It's never a bad time with 5.9% financing. Never a bad time. I got an idea. Come with me. I tell you what I'd like for you to do, I'd like for you to wear this. And it'll just help to remind people that you served this country for 20 years. I don't know if I would think that was right, using that to sell cars. Well, Henry... um, salesmen... they sell themselves. I mean you are what you are. And that's something to be proud of. And I'll just tell you right now, I have the greatest respect... for our men in the military. You guys are what makes this country great. And God bless you. All right. Yes, sir. I think that'll help. Looks good. Someone sleeping over? There's sheets on the couch. No, that's my dad. Him and mom are just fighting a lot now. They're just like pissed at each other even when nothing's going on. I think it's just all... All this, you know? Jason, do you think this lawsuit is the best idea? - You been talkin' to Buddy? - No. I'm just asking you as someone who loves you. And is on your side. I can't come up with anything else. I mean... Everything costs so damn much. I mean, there's just... But everyone would have looked out for your family. The town cripple? How long do you think that charity would have lasted, huh? It's killing me to have to do this to coach. And it's killing me to have to do this to the team. But maybe they're all right. The lawyers, my parents, maybe they're right. Maybe someone teaches me how to tackle somebody, I'm not in a chair. We're not in this mess. If you think this is for the best, then... I'm with you. What is it with you that you wanna screw your life up for me? Love makes us kind of stupid. Well, thank God for that. Hey, Dad! How was the first day at work? It was great. - Yeah? - Yeah. Sell a bunch of cars? Actually, no. What are you up to? Um, you know, history. All right, I'm gonna wash up for dinner. Hey. Hey. So what are you doing out here? Honestly, I was just kinda wishing that Arnett Mead loses to Buckley and then we get to go to the playoffs. And then I don't have to spend every day of the rest of my life wondering what if as I'm punching at the feed store. The feed store? Yeah, okay. What is all that? This is some kind of frozen casserole. My mom made it. Just thought it would help out. Am I really that pathetic? No, you're not pathetic. You just... You just do so much, that... I just thought you could use some help out. I don't know what I was expecting to be different with my dad living here. Maybe he just needs some time to settle in. It seems like the more he settles in, the more uncomfortable he gets. I don't know. I guess I wanted him to want to be here, not just to be here. It makes sense, though. He's been in the Army for 20 years. That's what he does, what he's good at. That's what he takes pride in doing. Now he's trying to be a dad. And that means he's gotta wake up and sell used cars every morning for Buddy Garrity. I can't take it personally that he's not happy here. Matt, you can just get angry. No, I can't. He's trying. I mean, what else can you really ask of anyone? Welcome, ladies and gentlemen</i> to the annual Women's Booster's Club Rodeo Fair!</i> I'm getting gray hair over this Arnett Mead game. Getting gray hair over this damn lawsuit. I'm getting a lot of gray hair this week. And I'll tell you, if this job gets cut out from under me, there ain't gonna be no more coaching. - That's not gonna happen. - No, that's what'll happen. Don't forget how good you are at what you do. That's the problem, it's not up to me. - I know we gotta go to the rodeo. - Sorry, I know. So there's this art house theater about 40 miles from here. I saw just Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. It was really cool. I mean, even Matt liked it. Wait, pause. - Matt goes to foreign art films with you? - Yeah. Uh, Smash does too. He thought it was really interesting. Really? Man, what the hell is Julie getting my ass into? Italian cinema? Hey, have you heard anything about the game? - Oh, you ain't hear? - What? Danny blew a knee. No! No! Oh man, we're finished. Man, this is over. We're done. Man, this ain't exactly going the way I was hoping. What? What are you talking about? Man, I've never known a girl like this. Like what? Like she won't pay attention to me, but I know she likes me. Maybe that's just her way of getting you to pay attention to her. I don't wanna pay attention to her. I want her to pay attention to me. - Okay. - That's how I'm used to it. If you like her... maybe you should get used to a new way. Wait, seriously, Denny blew out his knee? Yeah, baby! Yeah! I never thought I'd be rooting for Buckley. - Buddy Garrity. - Yes, Ma'am. I'm sorry, it was just on, I swear. - You promised. - No, I know--I'm here. Hey, I'll be back. Would you come on now? You're with me, Buddy. Thanks. Hey, Mom, did you ever think of moving out of Dillon? I did leave Dillon. I moved to Dallas when I was 18. So then what happened--I mean, why'd you leave? I fell in love with your father. I came up here to visit and he wouldn't go to Dallas, so... You never know. Can I talk to you for a minute? Just one second. One second. Just for a minute. No drama. Just for a minute, please. I can't explain this to her anymore, I can't. This was too much, Bob. It was too much. - You ready for this? - Yep. Let's go. Tyra, people have fights. People do have fights. They don't have fights every day. They don't let men beat the hell out of them. Don't look at me like that, honey. Mom, you know, I love you more than anything in this world. So much. You're an amazing woman and you are a damn good mother. But God, you are such a loser when it comes to men. You're gonna let that man back into our house and I will not accept it. Well, - it is not your decision. - I'm making it my decision. I love you too much to watch him do that to you anymore. He comes back, I'm moving out. - Oh, Tyra, don't be silly-- - I'm serious. It's him or me. You choose. I could so take that guy. So, uh, how'd you like that concert at UT? Concert at UT? Yeah. Oh, you mean the one I went to with Matt and Julie. Yeah, that one. Come on, man. Keep your feet solid! Okay, who'd you say you saw perform at the concert? It was, uh, this band. What were they called? Do you even know? I mean, was it a band? Or was it a man? Or was it a woman? Was it a symphony orchestra? Do you ever hang out with Matt and Julie? I... You got 'em to lie to me? It's your own damn fault. You can't even see what's right in front of you. I'm Smash. Who wants to see me take on this sorry ass arm wrestling champ? That's right. Yeah. I got five on it, baby. That's all you do is talk. Come on, baby, let's go. Come on, baby, let's go. Hey. You okay? Not really. What's wrong? My mom's gonna be an idiot and let that jerk back into our house. I'm sorry. There's a trait in the women in my family that just drives men crazy. They treat us like crap and always come back for more. That's, uh... That's actually what I was here to talk to you about. I am truly sorry. For everything that has happened. For what I've put you through. Everything that happened with Lyla. I was a complete jerk and I am so sorry. If you would even consider giving me a second chance, Tyra, believe me, it'll be so different. Sorry. You know, so many times, I would have loved... to hear those words come out of your mouth. God, I'd love to say yes. But I'd hate myself for it. I'd be a hypocrite, you know? I guess timing's everything. That's what I'm talkin' about! The Smash, baby! Ladies and gentlemen, our first cowboy out tonight--</i> And, ladies and gentlemen, here's a little treat for you.</i> ...has blocked the kick! They've got the ball!</i> No one in front of him Across mid-field! He's gonna score! He's gonna score!</i> The 20, the 10! Touchdown! Panthers fans, get ready! We're going to the playoffs!</i> Comin' for to carry me home Thank you, Lord, for letting Buckley win. I know that it was nothing short of a miracle. And I thank you for that miracle. I know you truly are an all-powerful God to let such a crap team win. I know I've sinned, but I have to ask for one more thing. And I know that you know what it is before I ask for it. The playoffs. State. If it's your will, let us win State, dear God. In Jesus' name. Amen. Coach. Listen. I just came out here to let you know... that no matter what anyone says, no matter what happens with this whole lawsuit thing, just know that it was... it was not in my hands. And I was against it. And that you'll always be my coach. Hey, Dad! How's it goin'? Goin' good. How you doin'? Can I interest you in a Malibu? Uh, yeah, I wouldn't mind one. Um... Look... I know that you hate it here. It's kind of obvious in the mornings when you're getting dressed. And you're putting on the Buddy Garrity American flag pin. - I'll get used to it. - I don't think you need to. I can keep taking care of grandma and going to school, it's okay. No, really, Dad. She's been doing really well lately and... Look, you can go back to Iraq. I know how much it means to you to be there. And it means so much to me that you wanted to stay here. But it's okay. I don't know if I can agree to that. - You can have no legal guardian. - Dad, I don't know that I can let you not agree to that. Not really much of a car salesman, am I? Yeah, but you're a really good soldier. Sometimes that doesn't mean much. Yeah, well, sometimes it does. What are you doing? Where are you going? I told you, it was him or me. I wasn't kidding. Tyra, did you really think that I would choose a man over my daughter? Well, I wouldn't. I'm sorry about last night. I'm sorry that I got Matt and Julie to lie for me. They feel bad, you're pissed. And it's all my fault. And I'm truly sorry about that. - Yeah, me too. - There's something else I gotta say. Yeah, I like myself. And I love football. I love it. I love the game. I love the crowds. I love the attention. I love being a star. I can't help it. It's a beautiful thing. It's just who I am. It's how God made me. I like you a lot, Waverly. I mean... more than I've ever liked any other girl. But... if you don't like me for me... then I gotta live with it. 'Cause I can't be nobody but the Smash. And yes, I like talking about myself in the third person. Something tells me deep down inside you like it too. I'll see you around, Smash. Sometimes the problem is that what's gonna happen</i> just isn't up to you. Then fate takes a turnaround to the backyard</i>
