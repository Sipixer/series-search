I got parents who are breaking up 'cause of some stupid lawsuit. I lost a coach. Lost in quad rugby. So I got nothing. A bipolar disorder? It can be dangerous sometimes. People get really depressed. Even suicidal. Hut. Backside pressure. There ya go. You ever think about coaching? No! Get in the truck. Ah, you bitch! He tried to rape me. By who, huh? Honey? Honey. Honey? - Wake up. - What? What? What time is it? No, you're all right. You're all right. You haven't missed your flight yet. It's not 4:00 yet. So I coulda been asleep. Sweetheart? I just woke up with the worst feeling. That we shouldn't move to Austin. It's just-- It's cold feet. You just don't-- - It's cold feet. Shh. - Well, maybe it is, but sweetheart... When you go into TMU today, please just don't commit to them. I just-- Okay. - Did you hear me? - Uh-huh. - You sure? - Yes, I hear you. Guess it is time to get up. I'm gonna kill you. Sweetheart.

A guy with the reputation that you've got, with the accomplishments that you've had at the high school level. The way you've developed those young kids. We think that you would be an unbelievable addition to our staff here. Well, I appreciate that. I know a couple weeks ago we talked, and, and, uh... the offer's been out on the table for a week, Eric. I know. I understand that. Are you having second thoughts? No, I'm not having second thoughts. It's just a matter of, uh-- well, you guys understand. You don't want the news to get out if you've got a championship game coming up. Well, I'm gonna be really honest with you, Eric. I've got another guy. He's been offered three jobs at three different universities. We've come to the point where we can't risk losing our second choice while you're making this decision. We've got to know something, and we've got to know it now. Or we've gotta withdraw our offer. Gentlemen, I accept. Friday Night Lights 1x21 Best laid plans Transcript: Raceman Synch: Tauri41 ..:: www.forom.com ::.. I'm coming! Landry? You're not in school? No, I ditched calculus. It's no big deal. You ditched a class? Have you ever in your life ditched a day of class? Psh, yeah. Like a few times. No. I didn't think so. But, um, I noticed that you weren't in school today or yesterday, so I just - wanted to see how you were. - Landry, don't. It's no big deal. Wanted to see if maybe you talk to anyone about this. Like, maybe your mom. No. No. My mom happens to be in the boonies with my aunt, who's dying of ovarian cancer. So... You know, there's bigger things going on. I'm sorry. Yeah, well. I mean, there's gotta be someone that you can tell about this. No. - I mean, like, some kind of relative. - Landry, there's no one! Okay? It's nobody's damn business. So don't go telling anybody. You understand? Yeah. Just forget about it. Man, I just don't see why we gotta go to this stupid roast anyways, you know? I feel you on that, man. Ma we are actor leads we are not comedians, you know what I'm saying? That's why it's funny. 'Cause y'all suck. Look, how 'bout this one? When Matty first became QB, he was so shy, he had to email all his plays. Like I said, y'all suck. Hey, say that again. No, say that again. Say that to my face. Baby, baby, can I talk to you for a second? Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, um, about the banquet. Roast. Whatever. Um... I don't think I can go. What you talking about? You my date. Look, The Smash don't fly solo. Okay, I know that The Smash has his ways and everything, But I just... I feel like with everything I'm going through right now, it's just-- It's too much. Baby, it's sittin' and eatin'. How is that too much? Just trust, okay? It's gonna stress me out, and I need to stay calm and focused. I need structure right now. Okay. Thanks for understanding. Come on, we'll work on your jokes. All right, thank you very much. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? - No, what are you doing here? - I asked you first. Well, I live here in Dillon. So I'm here to get some paperwork filled out. 'Cause you are now looking at a gainfully-employed assistant football coach for the Dillon Panthers. - No way. - Yes. Aw, cool. Now you. What are you doing here? Oh, a ticket. You know, get a traffic ticket in Dillon, you gotta pay it in Dillon. So... Well, uh... How long are you here for? A couple weeks. I'm helping my sister... - paint and get her place-- - That's nice of you. - Yeah. - A couple weeks? - A couple weeks. - Well, if you've got any, uh-- if you've got any downtime while you're here then... Oh, anything to get me outta that house. Well then, we should se a movie or-- or dinner or something, catch up. Sounds like a date. Not a date. A plan? A plan. - Yes. An arrangement. - An arrangement. So Thursday? Thursday would be great. All right. Great. - All right, cool. - So Thursday it is then for the, uh-- for the arrangement. Take care. Yeah, you too. - And I'll see you then. - Bye. Thursday. Hey. What's going on, man? I gotta-- First you miss Mud Bowl, and then I can barely even get you on the phone. How'd it go? I mean, what happened? How'd what go? The big study date with Tyra Collette. Oh, it went fine. Fine? Well-- Did you confess your love to her? This is all just some kind of big joke, isn't it, Matt? "Landry's got a big crush on Tyra." I'm just here for the comic relief for the star quarterback, - is that it? - No, that's not it. I'm just curious how it-- what happened? What's wrong? You promise not to tell anyone if I tell you this? You're not gonna say a word about it to anyone one? Yeah. You're not gonna tell Julie? You're not gonna tell anyone about this? No, I'm not gonna tell Julie anything. What? There--there was an assault. What do you mean, "There was an assault?" I was late. And then there was this guy. Some stranger that attacked Tyra outside the Alamo Freeze, and then - tried to do-- - Is she okay? Well, yeah. I mean, she--she-- She fought him off. What did the cops say? Well, she didn't want to tell the cops, so we-- So who'd you tell? She didn't want anyone to know. I mean, she just wanted to, you know, not make a big deal about it, and just-- Matt, look-- She just wants to kinda-- I have no idea-- I mean, she swore me to secrecy, man. So what am I-- What am I supposed to do? Matt, tell me what I'm supposed to do in this situation. You gotta tell somebody. Landry, you know. You have to tell somebody. Hey, babe, how'd it go? Hold on, I'm just on the phone. I'm just trying to reach Tyra. She's been MIA. Can't wait to hear how it went. Sweetie, I hate to send a message-- - It went pretty good. - Have you been drinking? You didn't tell 'em "yes" yet, did you? Here's how it went down. First of all, I was hot-boxed from the get-go. It was-- it was either accept the job or lose the job. I didn't want 'em to think that I didn't want the job, obviously, you know. You didn't tell 'em-- So I said, "You know, I gotta think about this. Yes, I accept the job." So, um... This stadium... It's just like-- it's unbelievable. And then, uh, I went around Austin. They put me in a car. They had me drive around. It was-- it was pretty-- It was pretty incredible. And then, uh... - Yep. - Hey. I took the job in Austin. Want to talk about it? Oh. It's Julie, honey. All right. I'll get it. Okay. Hey, you want to come inside? You okay? What's going on? What? Tell me. I'm moving. What--What do you-- What do you mean? My dad took this-- this job at TMU. Yeah. - Good morning, Coach. - Come on in here, man, you're 15 minutes late. I was? You told me to be here at-- No, I said 15 minutes ago. Don't talk back to me. - No, sir. - Hey, Saracen. Get your lazy ass in here. Let's go, come on. Hurry up. I don't have much time. - Hiya, Street. - Saracen. - What's going on? - Sunday. Big championship game. How you feelin'? Good. I'm feeling good. Yeah, you think you're ready? Yeah. You think he's ready? I don't think he's ready. I'm not thinking you're ready either. I think that if he plays up in Dallas liked he played last Friday night, they're gonna eat him for breakfast. That's pretty much what I'm thinking. I think they're gonna squash him. Pretty much like a bug. Like a flea, Saracen. So I don't want you resting on your laurels, you understand me? - You don't have any laurels, Saracen. - Not a damn laurel. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna be working with Jason here. Okay. You're gonna do everything Jason tells you to. And you're gonna do it because Jason has my blessing. So if he tells you to jump off a cliff, I want you to jump off that cliff. Now you tell me, Saracen, why are you gonna jump off that cliff? 'Cause--'cause he has your blessing? That's exactly right. You have any problems, you let me know. - Thank you, Coach. - Have a good day, son. All right, Coach. What are you still standing here for, Saracen? Go finish your weights, finish your program. Get your plays, meet me in the film room for lunch. And get used to that because we're gonna be having an awful lot of meals together. Well actually, I usually have lunch with Julie. I'll take care of Julie for you, don't worry about it. I'll give her a nice call, tell her there's a new girl in town. And that girl is me. Thank you, Saracen. Hit the weights. Okay. Great. It's just that this friend made me promise not to tell anyone. So I-- Well, that's--that's-- that's common, I think. Sometimes when people experice trauma, um, they'll sometimes want to hide. You know, for fear of, um, reprisal. Or--or, um-- Or judgment. Sometimes that happens. Is there some kind of law that if I do tell you the student's name that was assaulted that you've got to report it? Isn't--isn't-- isn't that some kind of law? Um... I don't want you to be offended by this, but, if-- if it turns out that your friend is actually you, I want you to feel comfortable. - And you've been hurt-- - No. I want you to know you can absolutely - talk to me... - I'm not talking about me. ...completely safely about that. I'm not talking about me, okay? You can tell me. I'm talking about Tyra. Collette. Oh. Hey, Tyra. Look, it's not that big of a deal. Yeah, it is, sweetheart. Let me ask you one more time: do you remember leaving your notebook behind? No. But, when he came outside he had a notebook that looked like your notebook? Look, I already told you, I don't remember leaving my notebook. Are we done here? Can I go now? I believe that about covers it. We just have to get a few pictures. All right, let's-- Let's go do that quickly. Turn your head to the left. Tyra, I'm sorry-- No, you know what, I never should have trusted you. - Tyra, I'm-- - You know what you are? You are just a pathetic, smelly geek. And I never want you to talk to me again. So, uh... yeah, I guess, just, uh... Just give me a call when you get a chance. All right. You know, Tyra isn't even returning my phone calls. Guess I'm just not cool enough anymore. You never know what's going on with somebody, sweetie. Can't take it personally. The whole move, it's just like a bad dream on repeat. I know. Hey, babe! Hey. Hey, come on, let's go celebrate. I'm taking you out to dinner. Taking you out to dinner. Anywhere you wanna go. Julie, you get to choose. Wherever it is that you like to go. I know what's gonna happen next. The door's gonna slam. Why is that? What's going on? Hi. Come sit down. Hi. What? I don't know, that's why I'm-- I don't know. Why don't you tell me? What is it? I've been thinking about something today. And I'm gonna make a proposal to you, and I don't want you to jump any kind of immediate decision about it, but... Okay, all right. Okay. I've been thinking that, um... Julie and I could maybe stay here until she graduates from high school. That would give her some closure here. It would allow me to continue my work here with the kids. Dillon and Austin aren't that far away from each other. I mean, it's not a long commute. You could go on, take the job in Austin. It's not ideal, but it's a way that we could continue our lives, keep this family together. No. Just no? Yes, no. There's no way. You can't say, "Just no." No, and I'll tell you why it's not gonna happen, 'cause that commute between Dillon and Austin is not just a simple commute. That's a separation between this family, no way. You know what, I need you to just - think about it for a second. - I'm thinking about it. I'm listening. I thought about it. Well, I think we need to start to consider this now from the perspective of three people in this family. And you and I have a solid relationship. We have a mature relationship. We are mature people, and I know that our relationship can handle it. Well, you know what? No, in that sense, I'm not mature, I'm not mature. I can't handle that, because that's not a relationship. That's not a family. That's not what this family's gonna do. And as far as those three people, you're leaving one person out, and that would be me. 'Cause I don't agree with this at all. I do not agree with any bit of what you've said. Well, honey, you know what I'm thinking about right now? I'm thinking about how bad I'm gonna feel leaving these kids here. Why is this happening? Honey? I need you to hear me here. I hear you. I hear what you say. What I'm doing here is important. I did this thing with Tyra today. These kids need me. And that's something that I need. There are other jobs, and there are other kids that need your help. No, there are not other jobs. There is this job. I took the job, and we are moving to Austin, period. These kids need me here. I would feel bad to leave. Can't you understand that? You're gonna be so great in Dallas. Look, I'm gonna do what I do. That's all I can do. Well, you know me, my aunt, and my cousins are driving up to root you on. Oh, for real? Yeah. Oh, well, I'll have to keep that in mind then. Yeah, you might wanna do that. - Hey. - Hey, Wave. Um... Can I holla at you for a second? Oh, yeah, I'll catch up with y'all later. We's just talking, that's all. Listen, um, I've been thinking about this a lot, and, um, I'm gonna give you a hiatus. A what? A hiatus for two weeks while you're at State. I want you to just have the time of your life, you know? I don't need no hiatus. Look, I just-- I don't wanna be the one held responsible for taking away your joy. So look, you're saying for two weeks, I could do whatever I want. Well, I wouldn't go crazy or anything. Like, try not to break the law, you know. But, um... But, yeah. Enjoy yourself. I don't-- but, you-- we gonna be partyin'. - I know. - Okay, we gonna be going to State. And you just gonna be sitting at home, taking your meds, and going to bed early. I mean, what if I'm hanging out with another girl at the roast or one of the parties? I don't know. It's all right. That's all right? That's all right. You know, just... enjoy yourself. Be The Smash. Okay. Okay. Okay, I could do that. I know you could do that. I could do that already. Good mornin'. Hey. All right, this is what I'm thinkin'. - Listen, I've been thinking too. - Listen for one second. - No. I'm-- - Dinner, tonight, - No, not dinner tonight. - tacos. That's fine. That's fine. No, not dinner at all. What do you mean? It's... over. We're not doing this anymore. You all right? Why? Because maybe Bo will get hurt. He just-- he thinks you're, like, a father figure, you know. He's had a really tough time with his daddy, and I don't-- I didn't think I was hurting him. Well, you're not now, but, I mean, you know-- I just, I can't do it to him. I can't risk it. I love him. He's my-- I'm sorry. We need to talk to you guys. All right? Your father and I are getting a divorce. We love you. We love you all. We do not want you to be hurt over this. - We love you. - This doesn't have anything to do with y'all. And it's gonna be just the same. Except Daddy's not gonna be living here. Y'all are gonna live here. I'll see y'all on weekends. You're gonna see them every other weekend. Every other weekend. And then, uh, holidays. I can't. - Lyla-- - I need to get some air. Lyla, honey, I need you to come back. Nope, I'm done. We need to talk about this as a family, sweetie. He can leave, and then I'll come back. How 'bout that? So sorry I'm late. No, don't worry about it. It's Herc's fault. Right. Sure. How ya doin'? I'm good. How you doin'? Good. You look nice. - Yeah? - Yeah. Very nice. Thanks. You wanna go eat? Yeah. Oh, man, that was really fun. It was. Besides the fact that our waiter was an idiot. I know. I don't think we helped. I think we might have confused him further. You're fun. A little bit. A lot with you. I, um... I like you. Um... I'm starting to feel really embarrassed. No. I, uh... I, uh... I like you too. Really? Uh, you know, really, I do.  I, uh... Oh, my God. Jason. Lyla, I... Can we talk? Can you go inside, just for a minute? Please? 'Cause it's not what you think. No, you know what? I'm done. Screw you! Hey, Tim Riggins. How you doing, little man? Good, you wanna hang? We could play football and do anything. Hey, uh, did your mom talk to you at all lately? Yeah, she said that you would be busy with football and school, that you wouldn't have time to hang around anymore. I think she's kind of right, Bo. But I figured since... we're obviously buds, you could make time for me. 'Cause we're like brothers. I agree. But like your mom said, I got a lot going on. Okay? Okay. But I'll come by later? - Sure. - Yeah. Hey. - Yeah? - Who pushes you around? Nobody! There we go. Nobody pushes Bo Miller around. Let me guess, the old lady you were getting with dumped you. - Is that what's going on? - Interesting. How do you know? Small town, Tim. Right. - Forgot. - And no, the ex-girlfriend Tyra's not available to screw your pain away. That's not why I'm here. - Really? - Really. I'm here just to see if you just wanna hang out. As friends. I kinda... I could use one right now. Do you even know what a friend is, Tim? You know, a friend is someone who's there for you. Who helps you do what's best for yourself.  Who... asks you to go out and do things. That's a friend. Come to the Panther roast with me. That's not what I meant, Tim. I know it's not what you meant. Look... I'm tired of over-thinking every single thing, you know? Let's just hang out and laugh and have fun. You and me. As friends. Please? Matty used to be so shy, he had to email all his plays. Hey, everybody! Hey, we're going to State, people! All right! Everybody take your seats! Take your seats! Time to start the annual roast banquet. Everybody hurry up and sit down! Let's get this roast going. I'd like to bring up for our first speaker, first-time Coach for the Dillon Panthers, took us all the way to State this year. Coach Eric Taylor, baby! Let's start tonight with... The Smash. Now, what is there to say about Smash? There's nothing to say about him, I don't think, that he hasn't already said about himself! I'll be owning it. You got me on that, Coach. You got me on that. You got me. Hey, you guys know how to give little Matt Saracen a hard time while you're here. He's done a great job, but I'll tell you, when he first started as quarterback, he was so shy... he had to email his plays in. Come on, Matt! Now, for as long as I've known Tim Riggins, there's only two phrases that can put a smile on his face. Number one, we goin' to State. And number two, the results are in; you are not the father. Hey, I'm just playing with you, baby! I'm just playing with you, baby! Hey, uh, how about Saracen sleeping with the Coach's daughter? Nothing quite like athletes doing comedy. I think it's tradition. Yeah, but so was tar and feathering. You can't stay in Dillon. That's absurd. Thank you for calling me absurd. But Buddy Garrity will tell you that it is much... I'm not calling you absurd, I'm calling the whole thing absurd. Well, I don't happen to think it's absurd, obviously. Tryin' to argue that-- Will you guys talk about this at home, please? Tami Taylor! This is a roast, not a skewering. Oh, I'm aware of that, sweetie. Lucky for you! Um... Hi, y'all. I'm here to talk to you a little bit about Coach Eric Taylor. You all know him as your leader, you know, a kind of father figure, a hard-ass guy screaming at you from the sidelines. But there's a whole other kind of Eric Taylor that I know that maybe y'all don't. And I'd just like to share that with you a little bit. So let me start with what I've learned from him as a human being. I mean, what he has brought to me... as a person. The power I. The nickel defense. The three-four... The four-three... And of course, the spread formation. The ways I have grown... since I have been with this man could fill a stadium. And then there's Eric Taylor, the family man. We have wonderful Sunday mornings together... watching game film. Saturday afternoons with our daughter... watching game film. Oh, and then Taylor Tuesday where we'll have a pizza delivered and play Scrabble. And then... watch some game film. And I wanna tell y'all, I know he is a busy, busy man. Y'all keep him very busy. But he is also a sensitive and caring husband. And he'll take me out for quiet, romantic evenings. Just the two of us. And will commonly be heard shouting things like, "Pick up the blitz!" Or, "Hit and drive!" And my favorite, "Go for two!" Seriously, Eric Taylor... is a kind and decent man. And he's strong. And he has vision. And he's passionate. And he's real good at imparting that passion into the hearts of the people around him. And he loves y'all, kids. Every single one of y'all. I just want to tell you how much you all have touched us. How important you all are to us. How deeply we care about you. So thank y'all from our whole family. Thank you. You got a good one, Coach. A real good one. Hey, Smash. So we're getting ready to hit a party. You wanna come? Actually, I'm gonna pass. Yeah, I gotta rest up for the big game. Yeah. Thanks. Maybe some other time. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe. Hey, Landry. Tyra. Listen, um... About the other day... - What happened... - What other day? Okay, cut me a break here. I'm not very good at this. I'm sorry about what I said. It's not that big of a deal. I mean--- I don't think you're a geek. No, just a pathetic, you know, not one of your friends. Okay, I don't think those things either. I was just pissed because... Did you think that I really wanted to tell someone? Tyra? Well, I know why you did. I was just feeling burned about everything that happened. And I took it out on you. I'm trying to be better at a lot of things. Well, I guess that explains why you're getting back with Riggins then. What? I'm not back together with Riggins. No, I'm just here as his friend. Right, right, you say that now, but what about the after party, when all the beer starts flowing... And, you know, Riggins comes in with his cute but tragic Texas forever routine... What about then? Okay, Tim and I are just friends, Landry. You know what, I know that this whole thing is none of my business because you're a big girl and you can do whatever you want. But do you really wanna spend the rest of your life with someone that cheats on you and drinks all the time? Maybe who's just gonna end up working at a gas station? And then, you know, puking all of his paycheck up? Is that what you want? You know, he's gonna cheat on your some more, and then you're gonna have a few of his... not-so- biologically-gifted kids. Are you trying to make me take back my apology right now? 'Cause it's working. Well, I'm sorry. But for some reason, I really just think that there's a guy out there that'll show up sober. And that'll listen to you whenever you talk. And that'll actually, you know, respect your opinions. And actually take care of you. And actually recognize you for the smart and beautiful... and caring woman that you are, Tyra. You know, a guy that-- that guy-- There she is. What's going on, Lando? How are ya? Gonna come out for a few or what? You know what, I can't. Why not? I just can't. Hey. Hey. How was the roast? Buddy Garrity stole my email joke. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm looking into who gave it to him. Well, it wasn't me. I brought you a piece of cake. I missed you. I'm sorry to bother you, I just... I just thought we should talk about some things. And clear some things up. You made everything completely clear last night when I saw you with Suzy. I know you're upset, but I really need you to-- I'm not upset. I finally know the truth about us. You didn't have the guts to tell me, but now I know. And now we can both move on. Please don't come back. We done fightin'? I love you. I respect you. I am proud of you. And I am in love with you completely. I'm sorry for the way all this happened. I'll tell you what, though. Austin is gonna be good to this family. I know it is. But baby...
