if I'm with you. - Did you think it was gonna work on me? - It's not a line. I don't need nothing from you! I don't need to work at your cardealership. And I sure as hell don't need football. You have the opportunity to become part of a team. If you don't do it tonight, you're never gonna do it in your entire life. - It's that girl. - Noelle? She got my son's head spinin' every which way direction. I don't like it. Do you think maybe we should like talk about some... ground rules, so that we both know how we each feel, that no one will get hurt... What are we gonna do with Gracie Bell - while we're at work? - That's not our burden, that is our gift. Oh yeah. I think we could definitly have her there by 7:00. - Which daycare's that? - The good one with the waiting list. Sure, that would be great. I cannot thank you enough - for taking her so last minute. - You saw my homework? - Why did they have an opening? - One of the kid dropped out. Is that the one with the busy traffic? Can you hold on one second? It's on *side street. They got a gate, they got a surity code. - I left my homework right here. - Was the reason they have an opening? Maybe because of the traffic on the street. Wonderful, we'll be there. Honey, honey, it's gonna be fine. It miraculous they took us in. Take Julie to school and I'll take Gracie. Now wait a second. I am calm. You're a little worked up. I think it's better you let me do it. You can take Jules. Come here, baby girl. - Seriously, I need to find my homework. - Say "bye, daddy." It's under the newspapers. You could've told me that earlier. Say bye to Gracie bell. She's going to day care! Bye, y'all. Matthew, you have always loved pancakes and I'm gonna make some. Well, that's... a lot of baking soda, Grandma. I've been making these for 40 years. I guess I know how to do it. You usually eat about ten of these, so hope you're hungry. Well, I'm eating this banana now, so I might not be that hungry later. That's a joke. What are you doing? Could... Could you reach my suitcase, please? - Thank you. - Where are you going? Thank you. Guatema. What, for, like, vacation? I have to go home Matt. My family needs me. Why? I don't understand, - 'cause you're supposed to... - Did he tell you? I'm making my pancakes. You are in for a treat... - Sounds delicious. - Y'all come on, you gotta get 'em while they're hot. Matthew has loved these since he was a little boy. I'll clean up after myself. Don't worry about it. Yep, cmnnamon d en a special ingrient.* Looks like a nice neighborhood. Fun little playground. Children coughing. - Hi, how are you? - Hi, Mrs. Taylor. Good. I'll be with you inust one minute. Oh, okay, great. Well, this is such a big day for you, Gracie Bell. eat and... play and... Nap and do all those things that you love to do so much. You're not gonna wonder why I left you with a bunch of people that we don't know and never met. I agree. Come on back... tomorrow maybe. I think you're absolutely right. I think maybe today wasn't the best day for it. 2x12: LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND Transcript: www.swsub.com Subtitles: Andy, DarKsh, GillesSilb, Ju, Sixe Devon Diablo, what up, homie? How'd you get out?

Where do you come from? Where do you come from? Beep beep, coming through. Hi y'all. Sorry about that. Good to see you. Hey, sweetie. How's that calculus going? Nice. So you wimp out again? Honey, I did not wimp out. Don't call your mother a wimp. It's demeaning. Gracie was not ready to go. When Gracie's ready to go, Gracie will go. So you're just gonna cart her around until she's married? No. - I'm not. - All right. - Good luck, Gracie. - Love you. - Have a very good day. - Love you, mom. Bye. Carlota's leaving. She's going back to Guatemala. The hot maid that you told me about? She's not a maid, she's a nurse! She's in nursing school. She studies a lot. Yeah, that's her and she's leaving. And she is hot. You're not sleeping with the hot maid, are you? - Kinda. - Are you serious? It's kinda cool. I don't... I'm speechless. I don't even know what to say. You don't need to say anything, it's fine. - I'm... I'm proud. - Thanks. Now she's going back to Guatemala. - Why is she... - She's got family stuff going on there. And there's nothing I can do. I'm in high school, I can't... do that. You haven't developed feelings or anything for her? I had develop feelings, - serious feelings. - So do you love her? I think so. Don't go there, all right? Whether I love her or not, she's leaving. It doesn't matter. She's going back to Guatemala and now I'm stuck. This is Lyla Garrity and you're listening to I was a Teenage Christian. Am I on the air? Yeah, you're on the air. Oh, my God, I'm on the air! Um, this is... Tina and I'm from Waco. Why Waco? And, I'm kind of embarrassed saying this, but... I mean, I think Jesus was hot. So hot. He kind of looks like a movie star. Okay, the image that you have in your head of what Christ looks like probably has very little to do with reality. That image has been generated by hundreds of years of artists... - What is going on out here? - <i>... being italian, so there really</i> is no say as to what he actually looks like. Is that Lyla? One more. What's the deal with the shroud of Turin? What's up with that? Again, no one really knows - whether or not that's true, so... - So, Someone just painted his face on a sheet? Listen, I know you think this is funny but it's not, it's rude. And there's real people calling in with real questions, so I'm gonna disconnect now. Yes, and we're moving on to Karen. That was a success. Is your way of telling her you like her? Garrity, what's going on? What's your problem? I know that was you calling in to the radio show, trying to make me look like an idiot. Why would you do that to me? I... thought it was funny. - To be honest with you. - You thought it was funny? Do you ever think about what you're doing? About who you might be hurting? I am doing that show, getting up at 4:00 in the morning and after school, trying to help people who might not have anyone else to turn to. Does that sound like something you want to screw with? Then don't mess with me on the air, please. Maybe... think about why you do things you do. Good night. You're lucky we came. How you doing? Thank you. We got that recipe on our trip to Spain. - I'll show you how to make it. - I'd love that. Can we go play with the Wii? - Of course. - Y'all got a Wii? - Oh, I'm coming... - Smash! I'm kidding. I'm just playing. Sheila, you wanna come play too? You know you want to play with the Wii, girl. Hey, I got winner. Take turns, amy. Well, uh, Corrina. Now that it's just us here, - could I ask you a question? - Sure. How do you feel about Smash and Noelle? I may be wrong, but I don't think I am. This relationship... it just scares me. It scares you? Yeah, it scares me. Your son is a fine young man, Corrina. But you know we live in Dillon, Texas, and you know that Dillon, Texas has its ways, right? And I don't think that we want to have anyone wondering and worrying about what's going on here, I think that... Well, no one else is gonna be so open-minded about it. With all due respect, the world has changed. I wish that were true, Smash. I have to admit I would feel a lot more comfortable if you and Noelle, stop dating. I'm sorry. That's how I feel. I have to say I agree. Righ here, see what I'm talking about? You got the three receivers set when they go into tlat. You know, I saw Tami and the baby ain today. Yeah, I know. It's day three. Every time they pass they end up moving around to the rig. Sometimes I wish Tami'd just stay home, raise Gracie, and quit the damn job. Hell if I'm gonna say that to her. You can get rid of that if you just force 'em to go left there. You got a right to your opinion, you know? I'm not so sure I do. I'm not gonna ask her to do something that I woun't be able to do myself. That's 'cause you're not supposed to. That's 'cause men aren't built that way. But women are. They're supposed to want to stay home with the kids. What the hell am I supposed to do? Shs got a career. She loves her work. She has spent 16 years at home with the first kid. I'm just saying that I wouldn't let a woman of mine go to work if she had a kid at home. That sounds really stupid and ignorant when you say that out loud. Well, sometimes the truth is stupid and ignorant. Then I gave up cheerleading last June. After everything I'd been through it was kind of ridiculous to be cheering in a little skirt for a guy to throw a ball. I actually burned my uniform. - What? - I was feeling a little dramatic. What were the sequence of events that lead you from lighting up to join the church? I felt lost. You know my... my whole life sort of blew up. In the previous six months, my parents split up and... a few other things that I won't get into. God was just the only source of comfort at that time. That relationship just grew and grew I think it's always out there, you know, just waiting for us. Definitely. Definitely. You are an interesting girl, Lyla Garrity. It's too bad you're so hard on the eyes. - Thanks - You're welcome. If everybody in the whole world would just not look at what's on the outside and don't judge people by the way they look, but instead see into their hearts and see their souls. If that's what we did, the world would just a better place. That's the whole thing. You just have to have faith in people. Let me ask you a question. If you had a gold watch, an antique goldwatch that your grandfather gave you, would you leave it in your house with a bunch of thugs? I don't believe I would. Chicken's good, hon. - Good job with the beans and the corn. - Just go ahead and say it. Say what? You know, day three, I didn't take in Gracie to the day care. I know you think I'm being weak and over protective. I know. Just get it out. No, I don't. If you'd been there, you wouldn't have been so brave either. I happened to have offered to drop her off. - But that was not an option. - You made me well aware of that. It wasn't an option. You we absolutely not in the right mind for it. - Are you guys fighting? - No, we're not. Eat your dinner. There are other options. Like what? What other options? - If you guys are gonna fight... - Shut it! Just sit down and eat your dinner. Other options. There's lots of options. - Such as? - One could be a leave of absence. - A leave of absence from my job. - I'm not gonna get in a fight about this with you right now. You don't have to, 'cause you could sit there in judgment and you'll never be threatened to have to leave your job which you love and have worked so hard for to stay home and take care of the baby. I hear what you're saying. - Can you pass the corn? - Sure, honey. Here's the corn. - I got it! - I'll get it. Or she can get it. - Hi, Buddy. - Tami, how are you? - Come on in - OK. Buddy's here. He's got a box. Oh, y'all are eating. Is it a bad time? No, it's fine. Come on in. - How you doing, Buddy? - Good. Let me get another plate. - Whatcha got there? - That's all right, - Make yourself comfortable. - I just came by because I'm... I took all this stuff out of the apartment. This is my prized possessions. I got my Babe Ruth autographed baseball and my granddad's gold watch and all this stuff. I came here 'cause you're great parents and you always know what to. To tell you the truth I don't know what to do 'cause Santiago's friends have resurfaced. His old friends, and they're like... I don't want to be judgmental and I don't want to be prejudiced, but these guys are, like... They're thugs. And I don't know if I should leave this stuff in the house 'cause I invited 'em over. It's his house too. His friends should come over. If he sees me take all these out... So maybe I ought to just put 'em back in there. OK, you know what? I'm getting real sick of this. Sorry I don't feel like talking to you. You're gonna have to talk to me eventually. Mom, What you and Noelle's parents did at that dinner was completely stupid, and humiliating. Stupid? Well, excuse me, but I have a right to my own opinion. - Not when it's messing with my life. - You don't get it. Maybe you're the one that doesn't get it. What are you doing? I'm getting ready. I'm going to a quincenera. You look beautiful. Thank you. - What is a quincenera? - It's... It's a birthday party for a 15-year-old girl, like sweet 16. The whole family goes. It's fun. All right. Well, have fun then. - Why don't you come with me? - Yeah? Yeah. Let me... Let me just go change. Who are all they? It's her family They're supporting her. Wanna dance? Come on! - It's a waltz. - All right, but... Okay. So, Put your hand my back like this. So I can rest my hand. It's like an arm rest. One, two, three. One, two, three. I don't want you to leave. I love you and... you love me so I don't understand why you'd be leaving. - It doesn't make any sense. - I can't stay, Matt. I know, I know. This... I know it sounds dumb 'cause I'm only 17. No, it's not that. I wish what you said was possible. My family... My family needs me. I have to be there for them. I'm sorry. Brian, the movie starts in 20 minutes. There's gonna be a half hour of previews. All right, y'all enjoy the movie. And come home right afterwards. - Thank you. - There you go. thank you for taking your little sister to the movies. You're welcome. Boy, boy, boy. Looks good, huh? Maybe I should go get some stuff for when they come over. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Here, let me give you some money. Get whatever you need, - Thank you. - You bet. - Here. - Thank you. Cheers... Let's talk. I think I forgot... I think I forgot... what this new motherhood... does to your life. How much it just turns everything upside down. And I really thought to be able to do it, you know? I could do the job and I could... raise Gracie and take care of you and take care of Jules and... But I don't think... I don't think I can do it, you know? I do think I'm gonna have to let the job go. I've to tell y'all... something. You're not gonna quit your job, so get all that out of your head. One of the reasons that you and I gave up that job down at TMU is so that you didn't have to give up your job. You're a damn good mother, a damn good counselor. And you're a hell of a hot wife. I was just inside on the computer. You know what I found out? I found out that separation anxiety is completely normal. We get over it. I also found out that certain studies suggest that children who go to daycare, actually, it helps them socialize. If, in years to come, it turns out the daycare screwed her up, she's always got you for counseling. You're funny. Stick together. It all works out. C'me here. - Hi. - Hi. Why we come all the way to this theater? Two popcorns, three drinks. Three drinks? Why... Smash, hey. Hey. - What did you tell your parents? - Late practice. You? - That's my little excuse right here. - Hey, Noannie. Hi. There you go. Thank you. Maybe we should go find our seats. Back up! Back it up! Back up, homie, all right! Everybody, drink! Have fun! Hey, little mama. What you're doing here all by yourself? My brother's right over there. Knock it off. Black on white actually run in the family? 'cause if it does, I could help you out with that. Jerk. All right, hold this up, baby. I said knock it off. - I'm not doing anything. - You leave my sister alone. You're the one that left your sister alone. Besides, you got one of ours. Why shouldn't we get one of yours? Come on, get up! Get up! Come on, come on, go! He hit me! I didn't do anything to him! You okay, you okay? You all right? Okay, just go right home and I'll call you, okay? Come on, let's go. - Give me the watch back, Devon. - What watch? No, don't play stupid with me, Devon! I know you got that watch in that house, homie. I don't got no watch, man. Don't be an ass. Give me the watch back! Oh, I'm being an ass? Okay, okay. I'm not the one who's sucking up to some bastard who's paying my way for everything. He's just helping... When did you forget where you came from? He's helping you out? Good, congratulations! Your fat fairy godmother showed up. Hooray! Sandman. Football star. It's not my fault I got a break, Devon. All right? It's supposed to be my fault 'cause I got a chance? Screw you. Do you think that guy would give a damn about you if you weren't playing football for his team? - I don't know. - He doesn't care about you. He just wants something from you and as soon as he gets it, he's gone. Now get the hell out my hood, man. Not without that watch. I'm sorry. - You shouldn't have even left me. - I know. I'm sorry, it's my fault. Look, look... - Just don't tell mom. - What? No! Please, please, for me. Don't tell mom. You shouldn't have left me! You shouldn't have left me! You are on the air with Lyla Garrity. This is Rita from Larribee. When I pray at school and I'm not bothering anyone else,</i> I just bow my head and put my hands together.</i> People make fun of me, and it's really hard. Makes me feel stupid</i> and I don't want to. What should I do?</i> People are gonna make fun at school for whatever they can get their hands on. But most importantly, you gotta be true to who you are. There's a gospel son, "This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine." And it doesn't just pertain to spreading the word.</i> It pertains to you. To the truth that lives inside you. Don't hide that from the world. Tell the world how you feel. Let your light shine. Thanks for calling in, Rita. We're going to James.</i> Damn it, Lyla. - How are you doin'? - Who are they for? A girl. Hello? Matthew, honey? She had to leave a day early.

All right, let me *wamk* you out. God Almighty! What happened to you, son? I had to... I had to get back your watch. Come on. Let's go get you cleaned up. Come on, buddy. You'll be all right. - How was the movie? - Yeah, how was it? It was good. I liked it. Y'all didn't say nothing about it when you came home. You sure are quiet this morning. - Hi, there. - Hi, how are you? - Good, how are you? - Good. - I think we're ready. - Great, good. - Oh, this is my husband Eric. - How do you do? Nice to meet you.
