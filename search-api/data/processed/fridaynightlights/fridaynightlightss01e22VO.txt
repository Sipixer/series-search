it's not what you think. - It really isn't. - You know what? I'm done. I know you're upset, but I really need-- I'm not upset. Please don't come back. I just woke up with the worst feeling that we shouldn't move to Austin. When you go into TMU today, please just don't commit to them. We've gotta know something and we've gotta know it now. Gentlemen, I accept. I'm moving. What do you mean? My dad took this job at TMU. I'm not going to Austin. Dillon is going to State! State, baby! We're going to State! Let's go, Panthers! Let's go, Panthers! I said, let's go, Panthers! Let's go, Panthers! All right, give it up for yourselves. Give it up for yourselves. Look, hey talk to 'em, Matt. I mean, I just-- I got nothing but respect for Voodoo and that whole team. No, no, no, no. We gonna shut Ray Tatom down. You want destiny, Voodoo? We gonna give you destiny. Saturday, Dallas. Lyla, honey, I need to talk to you. Lyla. Lyla, please. I need to talk to you, honey. It's just good to be a part of the team again and... it feels like I've come full circle. Hey, Landry. Hey. So it's good to see that you're out of the house and everything. Thank you, Dr. Freud. Well, I mean, I just meant-- Look, it goes against my basic principle to go to this game. But, um... Tim gave me his players' tickets and it seemed pretty important to him that I go. So... you wanna drive with me to State? I mean, the seats are on the 50-yard line. So I mean, it might be fun. Okay, so just go with you... to Dallas? Yeah. Yeah, sure. - Sounds good. - Cool. All right. See ya later then. Okay. And then I'm working on my mom. Maybe she'll let me stay in August at either Tyra's or Lois' or-- I'd-I'd try for Lois. And then we have Christmas. And we have Thanksgiving. We'll make it work, okay? Hey! You all right? Yeah. Have you seen your mother? She's supposed to be here. Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't be there. I had to get that press release out. The stupid computer broke down again. Well, that's 'cause you push the wrong button on the thing every time. I know. You know what? I'm on my way there. I'm so sorry. All right. Okay. Honey, I gotta go. I'll see ya soon. Bye. Hi. Could I have a pregnancy test? Honey, we are just extremely busy today. I see that. I know. How--how's next Tuesday? It's just, I'm six days late already. And I--I'm never late. I'm like kind of a Rolex watch like that. And I ate fish tacos on Monday night that kind of disagreed with me. It could just be the tacos kinda rumbling around in there. But I just wanna make sure if it's that and not something else. You know, they do have home pregnancy tests. I know, but I haven't been home. I'm going to Dallas. I can't--I can't wait. I just feel like I need to know now if--if that's possible. Hey! - How are you? - I'm good. I can take care of you. - Oh, that'd be great. - Come on. Thanks. Thanks. I appreciate that. How pregnant do you wanna be? 'Cause you extremely pregnant. Hmm. Okay. Well, do you wanna be pregnant, honey? Do I wanna be-- I don't know. I wanna be pregnant? I don't-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I mean... did you plan this? I mean, we planned it like 13 years ago,ou know. And then 12 years ago, and 11 years ago, and then ten years ago. And we have our beautiful girl. We figured, well, that's what we have. And maybe having another one just wasn't in God's plan, you know? Looks like God changed his mind. Friday Night Lights 1x22 State Transcript: Raceman Synch: Tauri41 ..:: www.forom.com ::.. I just don't understand why we can't just put Grandma in the back of your car. Hey, can, uh, can you come over here and try this? That's all you need. - Okay. - Well? Well what? The cocoa bean and the chocolate, among many other things, is a known aphrodisiac. The point is Tyra and yours truly are going to be driving in a car alone for four straight hours. I'm gonna be playing some sexy Crucifictorious and we're gonna be eating on these very fine, delicate, erotic chocolates. And this is--this may be the single most defining moment of my life. So you may need to tell your grandma to take the damn bus. Hey. Tim, I thought we weren't gonna-- No, I know. It's not what you think. Look... these are my State tickets. And I want Bo to have these. You're at 50-yard line. And they're good seats. And I think he'd enjoy it. They're for Bo? They're for Bo. So here. Take 'em. No pressure. If--if you don't go, that's--that's fine too. I mean, you can sell 'em on eBay or something for-- get him a PSP or whatever he's playing now. All right. That's it. Say hi to him for me, okay? Enjoy it. Who is that? It's me. What's up? Listen, I wanna ask you a question - before I go. - Shoot. Did you tell Matt Saracen I took that job at TMU? No. You're sure. Yeah. You're sure you're sure? - Okay, well, I had to. - Dammit, Julie. What did I tell you? What's going on? I'll tell you what's happening right now. Your daughter, in all her infinite wisdom, has informed Matt Saracen that I took the job at TMU. That's what's going on right now. - It's not my problem. - Jules! What?! Hey, it's nice to see you. How are you doing today? Well, honey, no. I mean, I'm sorry. I had--I had a number of things that I had to do. Oh, yeah? I had a number of things to do too. I wanted to talk to you this morning. I tried to talk to you this afternoon. I'm trying to talk to you now. But, oh, gosh! You know what? It's time for me to catch a bus. So I really can't do any talking right now 'cause I gotta get outta here. Honey, I need to talk to you just for a brief moment before you leave for Dallas, please. Go ahead. What is it? I'm all ears. - I gotta catch a bus. - I know. - You know what? It can wait. - I got a bus to catch. I'll talk to you in Dallas. - I love you. - I hope you have a great trip. - Bye. - All right. Let's go Panthers! Let's go Panthers! Let's go Panthers! Hey. What's up? What do you mean, what's up? Where's my tickets? What do you mean, where's your tickets? I gave 'em away. I can't believe you'd do that. You don't even like football anyways. Well, I know that. But it was nice to, you know, have somebody offer me the good seats for once. You know what? Forget it, Tim! No, wait. Hey, hey, hey! Come here! Gimme one second. Hey, look. Four. Four where? Four tickets. Where? Those are nosebleeds. I'll see ya there? Matt. Come here. I know Julie talked to you. I-I don't wanna talk about it, sir. You don't wanna talk about it. No, I'd rather just think about football. Sir. All right. Hey, Mindy. How's the stripping going? Momma, let's go! Our ride's here. Oh, hey. Um, I'm probably gonna be riding up front with you 'cause I get a little carsick, okay? Grab this one. There's another one over there. It turns out that I got four tickets instead of two. So I hope you don't mind that my mom and sis tag along. There's more-- more bags inside. Okay, that's no problem. Hurry up! Oh, God! These are incredible! Mm! Have you tried these? I have. I'm really glad that you're enjoying 'em though. I don't know what's in these, but... I just feel sort of tingly all over. I'm a little premenstrual too, so-- I know I'm hogging them, everybody, but that's all right. I'll pass it around in a minute. Is that Mrs.-- Is that Mrs. Saracen? - What are you doing? - Hold on. Mrs. Saracen, you need a ride? That's mighty nice of you. Do y'all got room for me? Hey, Lorraine. Oh, my Lord! Is that Tyra? It sure is. Did you bring the booze? Tomorrow, every seat in this stadium's gonna be filled up. It's what we've been waiting for. I've what we've worked so hard for. Does it get better than this? No, sir. Ah, hell. I don't think it does. Soak it in. Listen up. Stay inside yourselves. We can beat these guys. I take Matt Saracen over Ray "Voodoo" Tatom any day of the week. Matt Saracen? Yeah, I know him. I know everything there is about him. Honestly, there's not much to him. Well, I didn't really know Voodoo that well. He only played one game for us. So I didn't have that much time to get to know him. My defensive line is gonna squash him like a moth... like a flea. Voodoo's flashy, but anybody could be flashy. You know, Matt Saracen, he's got a lotta heart, and he's--he's creative. And when he's done getting squashed, maybe he can sit on the sidelines and watch me do my thing. Maybe he can learn something. It's football. It's nothing personal. But if you ask me if it's gonna feel good to put Ray "Voodoo" Tatom in his place, you're damn right it will. Well, it's a big football game. Big stadium, a lotta pageantry. Everything goes as we hope, we're gonna be taking that trophy back to Dillon to the fans. It's been a tough year on them. They deserve it. So then how does it feel to be leaving? Excuse me? Isn't it true you accepted the position at, uh, TMU next season? Well, no, right now, we're just focusing on this game. I'm sorry. You didn't answer my question. Isn't it true you took the position next season at TMU? Yes. Yes, that is true. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Drive one of this to Dallas to the game. Just pick the color. And if y'all do it today, I'll give you a couple of 40-yard line tickets to the State game. Hold on just a second. Y'all just think about a color. I'll be right back with you. I gotta take care of something. Excuse me. Hey, baby. I am so glad you came here. I cannot believe how glad-- What's this? The keys. I don't want it. What? Here's the title. - What are you talking about? - I don't want it. What do you mean you don't want it? You need a car! I got a car. I got a used car from Crespo's. You bought a car from that rabid crook? I liked him. Lyla, where are you going? Where--honey, you can't walk home. At least let me give you a ride home. Lyla! Yeah, this must be my day-ee-ay-ee-ay You're a little bit too late And it's a little bit too soon And I'm a little bit too strange For somebody like you 'Cause you're a little bit too nice Gitchi, gitchi ya, ya, da, da Gitchi, gitchi ya, ya, here Ya, ya, ya. Mocca chocolata ya, ya Ya, ya. Creole Lady Marmalade Okay, okay, okay. I think it's safer if we just keep the radio off for about ten minutes-- I think we just took a little detour into the "no-fun" zone. Shoot. We're gonna have to stop. I forgot Tampaxes. Anyone have one? Don't look at me. I had my last hot flash in 1990. Here you go. Oh, wait a minute. Did anybody fart? I know I smelled something. Who is that? Is that Lyla Garrity? Wait, Lyla Garrity, daughter of the car king, you know, stranded. I like it. Wait, why-- why are we backing up right now? What's going on? I mean, I gotta stop. It's the Christian thing to do. You've gotta be kidding me right now. -No. - You know who that is? You okay? Yeah. Hey, cheating cheerleader bitch. You want a ride? Oh, she doesn't want a ride. That--that didn't sound very Christian either. Why are y'all laughing about-- Let's just keep going. Let's just drive. Tyra, I'm not gonna just drive away and leave her here. Why not? I don't-- I can't. - Oh, because of the Christian thing. - Yeah. Would you please just get out and talk to her? Why don't you check on her? Well, she needs help, sweetheart. - You go on. - I hate all of you. - Please don't slam my door-- - Ah. - Garrity, get in the damn car! - No, thank you. Garrity! You know what? Can I ask you something, Tyra? - Fire away. - Why do you hate me so much? Oh, I don't know. That's easy. Maybe the fact that your dad slept with my mom and then tried to pay her off with $700 or the fact that you slept with my boyfriend. - How about that? - You know what? My parents are getting a divorce. - I'm sorry - So you weren't the only one that was hurt by that, okay? And you've been flirting with Jason ever since freshman year. That's what I do That is who I am! Everyone knows that. I wasn't gonna do him. And the thing that happened with Riggins. You guys were all ready broken up. Are you kidding me? You know, I heard that you and Jason Street were having problems. Maybe I should go sleep with him. I'm sorry. Not accepted. You know what? You're a bitch! Yeah, you know what? I am. But I don't accept it 'cause you didn't mean it. You have no idea how that felt. Actually, you'll be glad to know I know exactly how that felt. And I'm sorry. Wait. Jason got with someone else? Well... we have food. It's French fries, but it's something. They're chocolates there. - Be careful you don't squish 'em. - Now can we go to Dallas? Can you shut up? I just... I want the commitment that I can spend at least four weeks during the summer in Dillon. Sweetie, I've said to you already I can't talk to you about this right now. Why can't we talk about it right now? No, no, no. - My whole relationship with Matt-- - Honey, stop it! You are talking to me about something that is six months away. We have no idea what will be happening or where we'll be in six months. Right now, I'm just trying to get us to Dallas and through this damn football game. So just stop badgering me! You don't have to yell. Sorry. Go get 'em. Bring'em on Coach. Go get 'em tomorrow. Let's go, guys. Let's go. Good to see y'all. Coaches. I heard y'all had some kinda little game out here tomorrow. Yes, we do! Y'all ready? - Yeah. - Let's go get 'em. Y'all mind if I have just a moment alone with the coach? Eric, you mind? Let me tell you something before you even start in. When I first took this job, I took it with an idea of a five-year commitment. But when I sat down with you and the boosters, I never heard any similar commitment come from the other side. Matter of fact, all I heard was, after we lost the second game of the year, is that my ass was about to be fired. I just wanna make that real clear right now. So yes, I did put my career ahead of Panther football. Eric, I just came by to tell you how much I'm gonna miss you. You're a fine football coach. That's what I came to tell you. And now, everybody... it's my pleasure to introduce the man who has taken this team to State this year-- his first year as the head coach of the Dillon Panthers: my friend... Eric Taylor! I'm gonna cut through the crap. I believe I know what you all are thinking right now. Y'all are thinking, "Coach is a bastard for taking this job." I would say to that, that y'all have dreams. A lot of you have dreams to play college ball, pro ball. There is nothing more important to me than to help you achieve those dreams. I promise you that. I have dreams too. This has long been a dream of mine to coach a Division One school, like TMU. Whatever it is you're feeling, I don't blame you. It is all pretty raw. You may not accept it now. But I pray one day you will. I don't like the press. I never have. Shoulda been done different. I apologize it wasn't. Let's go get State! Come on, let's go get State! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! Panthers! The timing of the shocking news of Coach Taylor's exit from Dillon football couldn't be worse. Pretty pathetic, if you ask me, gentlemen. That's right, man. How many "all for one" speeches has he given us? I mean, one year and he's out? Look, everyone settle down. Stop being babies, okay? He got an offer to TMU. If any of you got an offer to TMU, you'd be gone in a heartbeat. Street's right. Look, forget about Coach. He earned it. It's up to us now. Who do we have here gentlemen? Long time, boys. Look who it is. Yo, Smash, can we talk a sec? Hey look, trash talk before the game is a sign of weakness. Look, I ain't here to trash talk. I been watching your game tapes, Smash. Now you the best damn back in the state of Texas, probably the country. Next year, come play with me at West Cam. A'ight, me and you together, that would be like nothing this state has ever seen. Every college in the country will want you. At West Cambria, look, they'll set you up real good. I got a nice place. Got a swimming pool. I got a dishwasher. It's nice. They don't treat us like second class citizens, a'ight? They take care of us. I'm a Panther. It's just a uniform, Smash. Look at your coach, I don't see him sticking around. I mean, he's basically leaving just to wear some stupid... red and gold shirt and be a quarterback coach. And we're just, like, another stop along the way for him. I understand how you feel, but all my dad ever does is think about the team. He's always watching game tapes and having endless conversations with my mom about you and Smash and Riggins. He's always analyzing and strategizing and planning. It's his whole life, Matt. Yeah, then why is he leaving? I don't know. Sir? What are you doing up? It's past bed check. I was with your daughter. I understand if you're pissed at me. 'Cause I took the job. That I won't be here next season. That I'm taking Julie away. All I can say is I'm sorry. But let me tell you this. And don't forget what I say. If you're ever... lucky to have a family like I do, I promise you, you will understand. I'll see you at the game. Hey, hon. Hey. Honey, I'm sorry I couldn't make it to that booster dinner, I just couldn't do it tonight. The Buddy Garrity of it all. - I just couldn't-- - It's okay. You all right? Yeah. Hey. Chocolate? No, thank you. I'm just gonna-- talk to your dad for a sec. You all right, babe? Mm-hmm. I'm all right. I saw that news came out. Hell, I tried talking to those kids. The kids don't understand. You're a good man, babe. Honey? I gotta tell you something that I've been meaning to tell you all day and I just haven't-- haven't been able to and it's the worst-- worst timing and I'm sorry about that. And we haven't talked about this in a long time and just don't know how you're gonna take it. I'm pregnant. What'd you say? I said I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? Yeah. You're pregnant, like, you're gonna have a baby, pregnant? Look me in the eye and tell me that. Don't kidding me. We're gonna have a baby, honey. You look a little peaked. Come here. Come here. Oh. Oh. I love you. I love you. Babe. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the Texas State Football Championship, the Dillon Panthers. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. The wait is over. We are finally here! Our Panthers have clawed and scratched all season and today's game will not be any different as rumors of Coach Taylor's departure have not been exaggerated. Now let's see how his leaving will affect these young players and his ability to lead here in the biggest football game of their lives. I think the entire town of Dillon is here. The great state of Texas is watching. The two best teams are in the house. But like the man said, "there can only be one." Good seats. Yeah well, I've got connections. Thank you. All right, listen up. Let's own this game from the opening gun, gentlemen. Understood? - Yes sir! - Let's go now! Saracen opens right. He throws. Oh! And the ball comes up short. Down he goes. Saracen gets sacked for an 11-yard loss. Look for the slant! Damn it, Matt! Matt Saracen and this Panther offense are off to a horrendous start. Taylor has to be concerned. His team has come out flat against this ferocious Mustang attack. Voodoo opens right. No, no, no! He breaks the tackle! He's gonna go in. And touchdown. Just like that it is seven, zip. Voodoo's back to pass. He's got a man open! Touchdown, West Cam up by 14. We're being punished, I know it. It's the curse of Voodoo. And Ray "Voodoo" Tatom is really starting to light it up now, folks. Don't look at him, don't even think about him. You understand me? You stay inside yourself and think about your next series. This is it. Coach Taylor's offense is gonna have one more shot to get some points on the board before the half. Saracen drops back to pass. - Oh no! - No! Picked up inside the 25. He is gonna go. Touchdown Mustangs. Holy smokes, the Mustangs have jumped out to a 26, nothing lead at the half. This is truly heartbreaking, folks, for these Dillon players, these loyal fans. These folks would follow this coach to the ends of the Earth and I'm afraid that's exactly where he's led them. It's unfortunate, but I'm afraid the controversy of Coach leaving has just been too much for these players. You can see it in their eyes, the look of defeat, the loss of heart. And it would seem that the hopes of this once great season may just end right here. When Jason Street went down first game of the season, everybody wrote us off. Everybody. And yet here we are at the championship game. 40,000 people out there have also written us off. And there are a few out there who do still believe in you, few will never give up on you. You go back out on the field, those are the people I want in your minds. Those are the people I want in your hearts. Every man at some point in his life is gonna lose a battle. He's gonna fight and he's gonna lose. But what makes him a man... is that in the midst of that battle, he does not lose himself. This game is not over. This battle is not over. So let's hear it one more time. Together. Clear eyes. Full hearts. - Can't lose! - Let's go! Riggins off the right side. Big hit, Mustangs. First down, Panthers. Saracen's got Williams on a short screen. He's got some room. One man to beat. Touchdown. Dillon Panthers are on the board. Oh my, the Panthers have scored. Voodoo back to pass. He gets buried by two Panthers. Come on, sack Voodoo! Voodoo drops back. It's a quarterback keeper. It's a draw to the inside. There he goes. Fumble! Loose ball! Oh my, it's a hot potato, greased pig. Somebody get a hold of that thing. Oh and the Panthers have it. The Panthers have it! He picks up the loose ball. and he's gonna pass--- Touchdown Panthers! The Panthers are back in this thing. You gotta take control of this game and you gotta do it right now. Get in there. Come on, baby. Saracen back to pass. Oh, it's up! Smash Williams on double coverage. Saracen threads the needle. And he's got it! Touchdown. Oh, touchdown Panthers. Oh mama, Dillon is one score from tying this thing up. Hold everything. Hold on. Smash Williams is down. He's getting up very slowly. He went down hard on that play and he is hurt. Let's go, make room! Make room! Come on! Where is it, is it your arm or your shoulder? It's my shoulder. Get it checked. Hey, I ain't going nowhere. Then go get it checked, damn it. You have a slightly dislocated shoulder. We can pop it back into place. But I just wouldn't advise that you play. No, no, this is State. Come on, - come on, do it. - Take a deep breath. That's it. Oh, mac daddy, somebody stole my Caddie. Smash Williams is playing through the pain. And he has inspired Panther nation. And they are one minute away from one of the greatest comebacks in Texas football. Oh, mercy! All right, 57 yards, y'all. Let's go to work. They're keying on the run, so we're gonna take 'em deep. Blitz 27 Razor on one. Ready? Saracen back. The blocking breaks down, he scrambles. Oh, Saracen is sacked, - down he goes. - Time! Timeout Panthers with six seconds left. What are you thinking, Coach? Wanna go long and we'll put it in the end zone? What are you thinking? Can't do that. They're gonna have everyone back. We got two shots. Coach, we can. We can run an out. And then we can take a shot. Let's take our shot right now. We got it, we gotta-- Coach, I got the play. What? Riggins runs an 18-yard cross. Smash mirrors him on the other side. I'm gonna hit Riggins and he's gonna come underneath the defense. And they're gonna collapse on him, but he's gonna pitch it to Smash. That's an 18-yard hook and lateral, that'll never work. You better be sure, Matt, if you run this play-- - It'll not work. - We can do this. Come on, Coach. Coach, it'll work. Run it. You run it. All right. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Saracen back to pass. He's got Riggins cutting inside. He fires a beautiful pass. Tim Riggins catches it short. Oh, it's a pitch to Smash Williams on the lateral! Go, go! He's breaks a tackle! Touchdown! Panthers! Panthers win State! Let's go, buddy. That's yours too. You deserve it, Coach. You deserve it. Yeah! Come here. Come here. Good job. Good job. Wha-ha-hoo! Well, that's pretty intense, Garrity. Yeah, well, it's been a really crappy year. Well... Panthers won State. I think it's time for a change. Apparently. Hey, Tyra. You want to ride home with me? Sure. Why not? Nice hat. You feel different? I do. I do. So now I want to talk to you about something. Here, hold that. This little one has got me thinking about all kinds of different things here, all right? There's more important things than football. There are more important things than TMU. But there's nothing more important to me than you and this family. So here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna stay in Dillon. I'm gonna be a father to this baby and to this family. I am gonna coach high school football. And you and I are gonna stay together. And that's the way it is. Yes? - No. - What do you mean no? You've got to go to Austin. This is-- this is your dream. That's what I'm telling you. That's what I'm telling you though. You are my dream. This baby is my dream. Julie is our dream. I'm living my dream right now. I'm not gonna separate what we have. - Honey, listen. You know what? - All right, what? - Can you just listen to me for a second? - I am listening,  that's why-- I don't wanna be responsible nor do I want to have this baby be responsible for you not living out your dream. And that's what I'm saying, you are my dream. I have walked with you all these years to get to this place, you and I together. And you know what else we've been doing together? We've been allowing the space to create our dreams, you know. And--and you've got it. You--you've got it in Austin and I've got it here in Dillon. I've finally-- I've finally got this job. And Julie has a big life here in Dillon. And it's gonna be hard. I don't know how we're gonna do it, but I know that our relationship means that we can do it. So what's going on? He took a team that was battered, a town that was ailing, and he did more than put a Band-Aid on things. I'll tell ya that. He healed this team and he healed this town. Now, how a man like that can abandon his team after one season is another question. Is he a great coach turned into an even greater opportunist maybe? Hell, I don't know. Let's take some calls. Tug from Barstow, what do you got? I shook that man's hand once, Sammy. I thought he had a heart. I guess I was wrong. Take a knee. All right, y'all. Today we're champions. Feels good, right? Yeah! Enjoy it while it lasts 'cause tomorrow we're targets. Next season, every other team in Texas is gonna be gunning for us 'cause we're number one. And I don't know about y'all, but, uh, anything less than another state championship is completely unacceptable. So here's what we're gonna do. Everyone think about the off-season. The off-season's about development. Development of strength. Development of speed. Development of character. Football is a 12-month, 52-week, 365-day commitment, gentlemen. Have a great day today. Enjoy it while it lasts. Tomorrow we go to work. Got it?
