I will, and when I make the national team and start touring all over the world, I'll take your daughter with me. 'Cause we're getting married. I just think that we're too young right now. And we're rushing into this, and I don't wanna make a mistake. Message received, Lyla. Loud and clear. That color looks good on you. I don't have the money for it. - Coach, I didn't mean-- - You didn't mean what? You didn't mean to risk my reputation, my career. Is that what you were gonna say? - I'm sorry, Coach-- - You thinking about that? He made a mistake. And he is trying so desperately to get back in your good graces that he's losing his confidence. He's losing his passion. I'm sorry, I was-- I was on the other side of campus. You're starting at tailback tonight. What the hell? You want a hug or something? Get outta here. Julie finds out about this, - that's not gonna be good. - Listen, you're gonna take a few pictures, it's for charity. Nothing happened at all. I don't appreciate getting lied to. So why don't you go with your little rally girls and just leave me alone. Come on, fellas, let's go! What do you wanna run? Slot right 28 Gun-sling. - You serious? - Slot right 28 Gun-sling. Go on. Okay. What? Come on, Panthers Bring it home, boys! All right, gentlemen, this is serious. We're going slot right 28 Gun-sling. Okay? Oh, yeah. All right, slot right 28 Gun-sling on one. - Ready. - Break. How's those hands of yours, seven? - Feeling good, Riggins. - All right! Arw you ready for this? Set! White 44. White 44. Hut! Saracen takes the snap and pitches back to Riggins. To Smash. What in tarnation? They got some kind of a halfback option. Oh! And Saracen, he's open! Wide open down the right sideline! Oh! He caught it! Unbelievable! The Panthers cruise through their first playoff game. And the celebration begins on the Panthers' sidelines. They said-- They  said we couldn't do it. Yeah, they did. They said-- They said we didn't have what it takes. Joke's on who? We got it done, didn't we? Yeah! We got it done! Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir. We went out there and we did it together. Y'all outta be proud of yourselves. And I want you to know that I am damn proud of you! Nobody pushes us around. Nobody pushes us around. Whose house? Our house! Whose house? Our house! Whose house? Our house! Now that's what I'm talking about. You worried about next week's game against Dunston Valley? Why, you know something we don't? Almost all-white team. Had some trouble recently with that hazing of a player in black face. Oh, we don't give a dang about all that. We're just goin' down there to play football, and, God willing, come away one game closer to State. Are you saying that race isn't an issue for the Dillon Panthers, Mac? No, sir, it's not. Yet Dillon was one of the last high school teams in Texas to be integrated. Only one black quarterback in 40 years. Voodoo Tatum, he left after two games. Which had nothing to do with his skin color. Look, you show me a red or a  black or a green player here in Dillon that's better than Matt Saracen, he's got the job, all right? What about Smash Williams? He played quarterback on JV. He's got quite an arm. Smash for quarterback? Yeah. I believe Smash is better suited for the position he's in. - How do you mean? - Well, guys like Smash and Baxter and even Voodoo, they got a natural gift for running the ball. All three are black. Are you saying this gift has something to do with their skin color? What I'm saying, Karen, and I'm saying it in a good way, is that guys like Smash are-- are fearless. They're dangerous. They're like junkyard dogs. I mean, you want them carrying the ball. You want them tearing up turf out there. So let me get this straight. Whites like Saracen make better quarterbacks because they're inherently smarter? Well, if you wanna put it that way, you could. But I'm not saying that all black guys are-- are dumb. I'm just saying that they got diff-- Mac, I need to talk to you. - Coach, a couple more. - Coach, we're not done yet. Sorry, folks, we're outta time right now. It's getting late. You know how it is. Well,  I think you got your story. Friday Night Lights - 1x15 Blinders Transcript: Raceman Synch: Tauri41 ..:: www.forom.com ::.. Mac McGill didn't use the word "monkey." He said, "Junkyard dogs." Monkeys, dogs, frogs-- Mac McGill said blacks are inhuman. That they don't think before they act. Like they're workhorses for the white man. Weel, now, you know I'm not sure that's what he meant, but thanks for the call. Next. Just 'cause rednecks like Mac learned it that way don't make it right. You can bet if he's saying this filth about black folks in public, him and his kind are saying a lot worse behind closed doors. Mac said blacks are shiftless. That it's the white kids who are hard workers... Why everybody so mad at McGill? God, I mean, he ain't that bad. He just says dumb stuff sometimes. And that's an excuse? Y'all need to stop. We got bigger things to worry about. Now there she is. - Oh, it's nice. - That's the house you're talking about? I mean, that's a real house. Yes, I know it. Dang, this is so nice. Wow, Mama, did you see the size of that closet? Oh, that's gonna be my dressing room. No it's not. Only if I get the second bathroom. Listen. Listen. Wait a minute, child, we don't own any of it. That could change if you let me submit the bid we discussed. Well... Mom, you said with the 10% down we could cover it come on. Well, that is until I get sick or, God forbid, one of y'all has an accident. Well, I guess we could just keep dreaming then. Come back every few days 'til somebody else buys it. I knew I shouldn't have brought y'all. But it is nice, huh? - For real. - Yeah. You skipped class? Julie, you skipped class? It was only one time. Ms. Carroll told me you skipped three classes. It was just P.E. Look, Ms. Taylor, we're really sorry. We will never do it again. Well, Tyra, that really sounds like a hollow apology to me. So you can just save it. But I'll tell you what you are gonna do is you're gonna be in P.E. for every class for the rest of the semester. And in terms of making up the classes that you missed, Ms. Carroll made a real good suggestion. Which is that both of y'all are gonna play in the Powderpuff game. Practices start this afternoon. You will not miss one of them. You have got to be kidding me. - You wouldn't do that. - Do I look like I'm kidding y'all? You wouldn't-- You wouldn't do that to me. Yeah, I would. But... Now, listen up Why is he here? This is gonna be so awkward. Ladies. Ladies. Over here. I'm Landry Clarke. Your official Powderpuff referee. Just wanted to start things off, and say, uh, let's just keep this clean. And let's just play this-- this beautiful game in-- in the spirit that it was meant to be played in. Thank you, Landry. Now ladies, let's meet. this year's Powderpuff Panther coaches. Huh? We've got Matthew Saracen and Timothy Riggins. You can shoot me now if you want to. All right, Tim, - you call it. - Tails, ma'am. Matt, you get first pick. Okay. Okay, uh, I pick Tyra, please. All right, Tyra. Tim? Does anyone here know how to chop block? I do. Nice, let's go. All right. Uh...Laurel. Good call, Laurel. Let's go, Garrity. Um, I'm gonna pick Julie Taylor, please. - Please. - Come on, Julie! Great. Hey, how you doin'? Good, how're you? How ya doin'? I'm doing good, man. Little bit crazy for me to come back to school. Had a free pass here for a while but... I'll catch y'all later. Only applies to certain rural interstates in specified counties. Y'all  just think about that-- Hey, guys. Can I talk to you a minute? Yeah. Uh...read your books. I'll get the questions later. You guys wanna get a driver's license, you gotta know the finer points. Been listening to the radio, huh? I just got done talking to the superintendent. They're getting calls from newspapers and stations all over the state. Like they got nothing else better to do. You need to issue a public apology. Apology for what? For being truthful? That's not the way people heard it. What--what people? A bunch of damn P.C. sons of bitches trying to get my job? Afraid it's not just a bunch of sons of bitches. Well, all right. You're telling me that you think Matt Saracen has as much natural ability as a Smash? What I'm telling you is that it's not too damn smart to be making generalizations about people's abilities based on their color. Think about that. That's what I'm saying. All right. All right. What's done is done. No apology's gonna change that. I'm not making a request. And you ain't gonna share? I thought you were on some kind of special diet. I  am. No sweets. Except for sweet chocolate. Here you go, baby. I wasn't talking about the cake. Mmm, okay enough. Enough. I can't believe I picked Julie third. I mean she-- Now she hates me. I'm tellin' you, I was reading up on pheromones last night. I really think they work. There's no smell that's gonna make Julie not hate me anymore. A lot of studies have shown that responses to odors, you know, depend on emotions felt whenever that odor was first smelled. Okay, even if that wasn't the stupidest thing that I've ever heard, I mean, I don't even know what kinda smells Julie would like. Well, I mean, she likes her dad, doesn't she? So, why don't you figure out what type of soap he uses. Then you can go out and get that kind of soap. You're retarded. Hey, at least just try it. Hey, guys, guys, check it out, man. Mac's on TV. Let me turn it up. I believe that all of our players, regardless of color, contribute to the spirit and the success of the Dillon Panthers. My comments were not intended to hurt anybody. And I apologize if they did. Thank you. Has there been any talk of suspension? Are you gonna meet with the players? Coach, just one question. What was that? You call that an apology? Tell me what else you'd call that, then. A lame-ass excuse. What is the big deal? I mean it's not like he yelled out racist slurs or anything. Yeah, but if we were up at UT right  now, he'd be fired. Exactly. Fortunately for us, he's not. Yeah, that's easy for you to say 'cause you're white and obviously selfish. Come on, y'all, it ain't that deep. What you want Mac to do, pay out reparations to all the Negroes in Dillon? Bye. Wave. We was just playing. Yeah, well, enjoy your sandbox, boys. A year of detention is preferable to Powderpuff. Okay, I don't need to spend a week watching Tim Riggins teach rally girls how to tackle. It's pathetic. Oh, and then he has the gall to pick that bony little-- - Lyla. - Hey, guys. Hey, Tyra, my dad says your mom's doing really good on the job. Really? Wow, maybe she'll get her own dealership one day. Yeah, I just thought it'd be good to know she's doing really well. That's real nice to know. Hey, Tyra. I was surprised to see you on the field today. Thought you hated football. You know what, I changed my mind. I'm gonna get real into Powderpuff this year. If you want, I'll jack up Greer for disrespecting you. Okay, you know it's not about me. It's about you taking this Mac thing seriously. Wave, I'm not Jesse Jackson, all right? My cause is football. Okay then, who are you? Because it shouldn't mean playing dumb. Look, I don't see Matty or Rigg jumping up on a soap box every time a brother says something messed up. You know why, 'cause it's a completely different thing. Well, then, that's racist right there. Me being expected to act differently 'cause I'm black. That's kinda the burden that you were born with, baby. The burden and the blessing. You know, you get all sexy, sexy when you get all preachy. You know what, Brian, don't do this, okay. Don't turn this into a joke. It's important, I want you to really think about this. Wave, I respect your opinion on this. I do. But could you please just recognize for one second that I just got through some real drama. I mean, I'm just getting my swagger back. I can't be sidetracked with things I can't control, baby. Look... I know that you're dealing with a lot right now. Okay, and I'm here for you. But sooner or later, you're gonna have to peek out from behind those blinders. Okay, I wanna see both partners using the scalpel. And both partners taking notes. All right, I'm ready. You ready? - I guess. - You sure? Now, look, if it's-- if it's any consolation, I--I heard that these frogs had a very long and fulfilling life. So it's all right. Lots of flies. And lots of... Tadpoles. You want me to do this? 'Cause I can. No, no, no, I got it. Don't worry about it. All right, well, just give me a minute. Is everything good? Yes, sir, Mr. Utz, we were just... just getting started. Now, Jason, if you just wanna observe, it's okay. It's all anybody expects. No, I'd like to just go ahead and finish the incision. It's up to you. Let's go for ten, ladies. As one, count 'em out as ten. - One...two...three. - Let's go! As one, come on. D-split 45, Garrity. Hut--hut. Let's go, ladies. Let's go. Nice. Good execution. I'm starting to see something, ladies. Get some blocks, here. - Let's get some blocks. - Ready, 44... Hot--hot crossfire. Set, uh, hut--hut--hut. There ya' go. Now go, now go. Oh, bad, bad, okay. We are a team of one, ladies. That's fine um, you just wanna make sure you catch this. One unit. Let's go, let's go. We've got to get this together. Hey, Matt! - Yeah? - Figure out what the hell you want me to do. You see that team over there? Yeah. Looks a lot better than us. Set. Hut--hut! Yes, you got the snap. What was that? You throw like a damn girl. Are you serious, Matt? That is your quarterback? She's really good at handing off. Good job, Coach. Hut--hut. Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry. - Really? Really? - I'm sorry. Hold on. Not her, not her. It's all right. It's all right, we're a team. Teammates. I'm starting to see a "W" in my eyes, let's go! Matt, okay, this isn't working for me. It's not working for me either. Hi. Julie? Yep. You think maybe you could play quarterback? Hmm, let's see, I was your third pick. Am I even qualified to talk to QB one? You're the only one who knows how to play. I do know how to play. But, uh, frankly..... I don't care. Um, excuse me. Lovebirds. Let's go. Practice. Please. You're pathetic. This is now about victory. Line up! Let's go. Strength and stamina. One of your teammates gets hurt, gets tired out there. You step in, help carry the weight. You give 'em a hand. Let's go! Let's go! Come on, man, stop slackin'. Oh, yeah? Wait 'til your turn. We'll see how fast you go. Stop the chatter, let's get it done. Yes sir, Massa. What'd you say, Seale? I love this drill, sir. Get your ass down the field! - Love it. - Move it. - Yes, sir. - Move it! Yes, sir. You shut your mouth! Hey, baby. Honey, I just broke up a fight in the hallway. Over this whole Mac McGill thing. Well... I don't know what to tell you, babe. Well, I don't know. I mean, just it's clear to me that it's not-- This thing is not going away. I mean, these kids were riled up. And it was a lot of kids. And it was black against white. It was racial. Look babe, he said something stupid, all right? He said something stupid. He made an apology. - I know. - There's gonna be fallout, - there's no way around that. - I know, I know, I know, but I feel like-- I feel like I-- I wanna do-- I wanna have some kind of a dialogue for the kids, you know. I wanna create, maybe, something after school later this week. - Like a forum or something. - A forum? Yeah, you know, where the kids can come and talk to each other and air it out. So that it's not just coming up with their fists in the middle of the hallway. You know what I mean? Yeah, that's a good idea. Will you tell your football players about it? I think it could certainly be good for them to come. Sure. Appreciate the support. - I'll see you later. - All right, have a good day. Okay. You got a steering wheel. You got your brake, you got your accelerator, all right? Where would they be? Well, look, this lever over here, you wanna go ahead and push it. Yeah, go ahead and push it forward. Forward? Okay. Forward is brake, right. If you wanna accelerate, you wanna go ahead and push it on down toward your knee. There ya go, down-- Woo-hoo. There ya go. All right, all right. All right, so you wanna put it in drive. And let's check it out. See how this puppy rolls. Off on the brake. Oh, don't be shy. Don't be shy. Straight on through? All right, all right. Next stop, Indy 500, huh? Shut up, I'm trying to get used to it, all right? Just give me a minute. I got it. And once you get comfortable, how's that feel? It feels okay. Yeah? Yeah. This is pretty easy, - I could get the hang of this. - You like it, huh? Yeah. Yeah, it's nice Yeah, a little bit of freedom? I could get used to it. Speaking of getting used to it, how's being back at school treating ya? It's okay. I guess. Yeah? Listen, when you got out of the hospital, was everybody just weird to you? Man, I felt like I was 100 years old. You know, like, uh, there was some sort of secret knowledge no one else possessed. You know. I mean, for a while there actually I wanted to go back to the hospital. Of course, that was partially 'cause there was this hot-ass nurse that just could not get enough of me. Oh, I'm sure she couldn't. You know, I just want things to feel normal again, you know? Yeah, well, I hate to break it to you, but high school is not normal. - Brake. - Brake? Brake. Brake! There ya go. You have a good one. Think I'm gonna take off. Okay, so, uh-- Don't worry, I got your numbers. I got your numbers and everything. - You good? - I'm good. Okay. Cool. Hey look, Smash, I don't think it's right. What Mac said, I don't-- I don't agree with it. So you think I should quarterback? No--I mean, yeah. I mean, I don't know. - I mean, I don't know if you play-- - I'm just playing with you, Matty. I know what you're trying to say, but I ain't sweatin' it. Neither should you. - You sure? - Yeah. Yeah, it's cool. All right. - I'll see you tomorrow. - All right, later. - Hello? - Hey. Hey, honey, how you doin'? Grand. How was Powderpuff? It was great. Oh, was Powderpuff tiring? Where's the supper? Oh, I don't know. Why don't you sit down? Don't-- Don't roll your eyes. Something else is gonna happen other than this Powderpuff thing as a punishment for you cutting class. I promise you your mom and I will let you know what it is when we figure out what it is. Yep, that's understood. And when you figure out what my punishment is, - I'll be in my bedroom. I don't want you to be flippant with me. I don't want you to be flippant. - Did you hear what he just said? - Can I tell you something? - Yes, I heard. - No, no, look at me. Please, don't do this. Don't break our trust. Don't take our trust from us. Please. I'm sorry, today's just been really... Really kind of a crappy day. Matt's been yelling at me all day about... Stupid quarterback stuff. Matt Saracen's got you at quarterback? Wait, honey. Hey, come here. What do you mean he's got you at quarterback? Two-zero. Hey, what up, Dutch Boy? - Get a new haircut? - Get a new hat? What's your order, man? I've actually been doing some thinking. You know all this friction between the team? It's just not helping right now, man. And State's coming up, so... You got that right. So, I mean, I figure you talk to your boys and settle 'em down. And we can just refocus on the game. You know? You got some nerve. The same dude who shows up half-drunk to workouts, walks off practice, and throws a glass bottle at my head wants to tell me to talk to my boys? I didn't tell you. I asked you, Williams. No, first of all, they ain't my boys. You want team unity, why don't you talk to your boys? This football done brought us together, but on the real, we ain't even cool like that. You're a lost cause, Williams. Mom? Mom? Hello? Hey. Here, honey. Hey, Mama. Ready to go? Uh, you know... I'm so sorry I didn't call you. I--I--I-- I gotta get through a... Stack of papers. I'm so sorry, honey. It's okay. Well, it's good to see you working. Hey, Tyra. Hi How you doin'? I'm great. How're you? Good. Oh, we're just fine. Your mom is the greatest. She volunteered to help me out and finish out tonight. She knows everything. Well, she's a smart woman. I'm just gonna-- I'll just call, you know, I'll just call Mindy for a ride later, when we're done. Yeah. Okay. Good. All right, honey. See you later. Oh, good to see you, Tyra. Yeah. See ya. Pro-left 25 sprint option. Now say it. Pro-left 25 sprint option. Nice, what that means is-- That means that you're gonna fake to the two back through the five hole. You're gonna be moving down and you've got the option then to continue your run, or you make the pass, depending on what's gonna be more efficient for you, all right? All right, I'm gonna do down about 15, cut across. You good? On two. Hut--hut! Watch this, hon. Here. All right, that's pretty good. - I gotta admit-- - Pretty good? That's a very good throw. All right, listen, I want you to bean me with this as I make it for the house. You ready? On two. Hut, hut! No matter what happens today, we're all gonna be winners. Please. We will not accept a loss. We will not accept it. One...two...three... Win! Let's go! Touchdown! Great job, ladies. Bring it on! Blue 42. This is supposed to be fun. Oh, honey, this is fun. This still about Riggins, because-- Oh, please, not even close. - What is your problem? - My problem? My problem is your dad, Buddy Garrity, and him having his dirty hands all over my mom, his employee. What are you talking about? You know what? You are just a spoiled little snob. You're not gonna win this game. Come on, throw it! You wanna throw it! She got the ball off. That's a sack. What the hell kinda call is that? Son, you're blind. - Honey. - What? - Calm down. - Excuse me. Stay off of my line. - What'd you say to me? - My line. Right there, that line. That one right there that's mine. Excuse me. Excuse me. That's your first one. This is it. This is our last chance. We can either go home with a tie. Or we can go home with a win. How 'bout we run the 25-right sprint option? Hut! Get her Kick her knees! Kick her knees! Keep runnin'. Keep runnin'. That a girl! Keep runnin'! We won! Good game. Good game. Are you kidding me? What's crack-a-lacka, y'all? What's happening? Eric didn't tell me you guys were gonna be out here. What's the occasion, how you guys doin'? Surprise! It's not my birthday. We know it's not your birthday, but we are here for a reason, QB. And that reason is... As a designated member of the National Quad Rugby Squad, I am here to inform you that you have been invited to training camp in Austin. No way. No way. Whoa, don't get so excited there, young buck. Training camp is two weeks of the most intense, painful, exhausting workouts of your young, wheelchair-bound life. And at the end of that two weeks, coaches evaluate the players. Then choose the new members for the National Quad Rugby Squad for the U.S. of A. I--I don't know what to say. I mean, you think I got a shot? Uhh...no. Like a snowball's chance in... But, I'll tell you what, we got four open spots. You make one of 'em, we're Beijing-bound. - That's China. - That is China. Can you say chopsticks and hot chicks? Yes, I can. Yes, I can. But now, you said my credit score was fine. I'm sorry, Ms. Williams. But I did tell you a pre-approved loan isn't always guaranteed. Oh, yeah, it wouldn't have anything to do with me being single parent or that little box on the application where you had me to check off my race. No, no, that's federal monitoring to prevent racial bias. Oh, it worked like a charm, didn't it? We want to talk to your supervisor. It won't make a difference. Well, let's do it anyway. I can leave him a message. - We're here right now. - I'm sorry, it's not possible. Let's go, Brian. No, Mama, they can't do this. They can't just take back the loan. Oh, there will be other loans. No, we want to talk to your boss now! It's not gonna do anybody any good to get crazy. Look around you. Look at all these eyes on you. Lookin' at you. Waitin'. Expecting you to do something violent. Become that junkyard dog of Mac McGill's, uh-uh. Don't give 'em that. You ladies have a good afternoon. Thank you very much. - Hey. - Hey. How's my QB one? Hi. - How you doin'? - Good. Can I ask you a question? Well the answer is "yes." You do look super-hot - in my football jersey. - No, umm... Do you think I'm a spoiled snob? - I'm serious. - Where'd that come from? Answer the question. A little. A litt--I'm-- I'm kidding. Someone say something to you? Want me to go beat 'em up? Well, I gotta tell you what happened to me today. - Yeah, I know-- - I got invited to Nationals. - What Nationals? - Nationals. Quad Rugby National Team is having tryouts in Austin for a couple of weeks - and they got four spots open. - Austin? And if I go and I make the team, then I'll possibly be going to Beijing later this year. What does that mean? What about-- What about our plans? What about school? School was a mistake. It wasn't-- - School was a mistake? - It's not-- School's not a mistake. Fitting in was a mistake. - You fit in fine, Jason. - No, I don't fit in fine. And even if I did fit in, I don't want to. This is going backwards, I wanna move forward. I wanna go later this month and get my GED. - And bam, be done with school. - Your GED? Yeah, my GED. I'm this close. I'm this close, Lyla. Me going to Austin for just a couple weeks doesn't change anything. We're just here to-- to have an opportunity to talk about race relations at this school and what's been going on this week, and air your feelings, and and have people listen to you. So who wants to go first? Ms. Tami. Anton. I got something to say. I mean, when it comes to, like, whites and blacks, man, we just-- we just different. That's a gross generalization. Dog, no, it's not, fool. Stereotypes happen for a reason. Hey, this is not a debate. Just so we're clear. This is just a chance for everybody to talk and listen. So if you wanna speak, you can hold up your hand. Let's let Anton finish. Like I was saying, if you look at who's with who, you know, in the lunch room or, you know what I'm saying, after school. At the end of the day, we just naturally go with our own. I mean, that's just how it is. I mean, that's all I'm saying. All right. All right. Landry. I mean, I think a lot of it has to do with how we're socialized. If that makes any sense. I mean, um science says that my DNA could be closer to that of a black person in Kenya I suppose that I don't know, the white person sitting next to me. That's interesting. Waverly. Let's face it, you guys, people say things like Mac said all the time and worse. But the real problem is people just refuse to acknowledge that racism even exists in Dillon. So we need to have more forums like this, - we need to talk about it. - Don't get your panties in a wad, Waverly. It's not like this is a big conspiracy. It is not like being white gives you the right to interrupt either. Thank you. And it's not like we're at a movie theater. Hey, hey, hey, quiet down, y'all. Man, what you trying to say, Thompson? He's trying to say that I can't even go to a movie anymore to a decent movie without some black person in front of me yelling and talking all the time. Sit down, please. Why don't you keep your dumbass, ignorant, racist comments-- Guys! Guys! Stop it! Guys! Guys! Stop it! Hey, Mac What you're doing here so late? We never got a chance to talk. About what? Well, about what you said, and how you may or may not perceive the black players-- What I perceive other than football is none of your business. Whoa, look, I'm just trying to have a dialogue. Well, you save your dialoguin' for your mommy. Now, wait a minute, you said-- No, you wait a minute, son. You wait just a minute. I've been here for 27 years. And I am not about to be interrogated by some too-big-for-his-britches teenager, you got me? What the hell you mean, too-big-for-my-britches, Mac? You don't wanna see-- This is done, all right? This is over. I'm done with this. I am done. Look, if I hear you whining, or anybody else whining about this anymore, you're gonna be warming your ass on the bench Friday night, - you got me? - Oh, no, you can't do that. Oh, I can. Yeah. And I will. I'm tired of this crap. Hey, babe. Hey. Well, it didn't go very well, honey. I mean, first of all, hardly anybody showed up. But then, I mean, I wish you could-- I wish you coulda seen the way these kids were yelling at each other. Calling each other names. It's real hard to make a change around here. You know you're an example to aspire to, don't you? You gave them an opportunity to express themselves that they wouldn't have otherwise, you know that. Because you're always there ready to listen to them. You never shy away from difficult subjects. They know they can trust you. That's a rarity. You're my wife, and I am damn proud of you. Come here. Oh, come here, come here, come here, come here. Hey, Smash. Matt. So, I-- I heard that forum was kinda crazy. I heard. Look, I was thinking that maybe we should - get the team together-- - No disrespect, but I'm really not in the mood for chatting right now. Let's go, gentlemen. Let's go. Got a lot of work to do today. A lot of work. Everybody feelin' good today? I can't hear you. All right, I like to hear that. Mac, let's call it. All right, you heard the man. Let's go, get on the line. Stride it out. On my whistle. You boys deaf or something? I said on my whistle! Ready!
