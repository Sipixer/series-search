You're gonna steal a cripple's girl, but you won't fight a cripple? You're a coward, Riggins! Always will be. I would like to tell both of you that I'm going on a date with Matt Saracen. Boys think about sex every single minute of the day. You're sweet, and I don't want to see you get hurt. I love you too, Dad. All right, how much? - $300. - A month? Try a week. All right, can I pay you next week? You're good for it. He's gonna need a little financial assistance, 'cause of the exams that he's gonna have to take. Let's show him how much we love him and we want him to make us all proud. Amen. Romans 2:16 tells us, "The day will surely come when God will judge all of our secret lives." If we turn away from God, and begin to worship foreign Gods, God will surely know. You know how He will know it? Hebrews 4:12 tells us that God will discern the thoughts and the intents of our hearts. Amen, amen. There are secret things that belongs to God, but the revealed things belongs to us. Brother Brian, our prayers are with you this Friday. We are praying that God will give you the strength to run all over Gatling this Friday. Amen. * My worship is for real Say thank you, Jesus  *</i> Hey there, Lyla. Hi. I'm sorry. There are no words that could ever express that, but I am so sorry. Please. Did you have sex with him? - How many times? - Jason, please-- Oh, come on. How many? You can go. Friday Night Lights 1.09 - Full Hearts Transcript: Raceman Sync: Tauri41 ..:: www.forom.com ::.. This is Slammin' Sammy Meade talkin' Panther football--</i> we got a caller on the line. Chuck, whattya know?</i> Hey, Sammy. I got a bad feeling about this game Friday night.</i> I mean, Gatling looks mighty hard. Road games are never good, but heading over there to Gatling</i> is like going to another planet. You know what I'm saying..</i> I do, I do. I mean, it's inner-city. It's tough. It's the hood.</i> And that Junior Silverio makes their defense brutal..</i> That's Silverio, and I'll tell you what, they don't call that defense</i> the Black Hole of Gatling for their good looks.</i> But we do have an interesting situation with Smash Williams.</i> Now, Gatling is his hometown. It's where he grew up.</i> And he's going against his childhood rival, Junior Silverio.</i> Yeah, yeah, that Junior isn't a middle linebacker, though.</i> He's your worst nightmare. Hey, Brian! Get those cleats off my table. Where's your mind at, boy? They're talking about Junior like he's the Second Coming. He ain't got nothing on me. Well, you just let 'em talk. You do your talk on the field. Hey, Ma, are we spending the night in Gatling? I want to see if Jennifer and Nicole still live there. Yeah, Mama, can we go and see the old house? We are not going to fool around. We're going to watch your brother play. Can we go see Dad? We're not going to no cemetery. We  moved away from there for a reason. Now y'all hurry up. You make me late again, you're gonna be walking to school. - Almost ready for school? - Mm-hmm. She's on the phone right now with Matt Saracen. - I don't think this thing's going away. - I have not even had my coffee yet. - Well, I'm just saying-- - Don't want to talk about this-- It's becoming a thing. I mean, it's a thing. And you know what thing it is? It's that thing that we always knew was gonna happen to our little girl. It's that thing-- that thing is happening now. Well, at least she's not interested in a serial killer, or-- or one of the Riggins. I've got the keys. Come on, honey, let's go. All right, let's go, let's go. No, get off me! I know, I know. Hey, Saracen. Whatcha gonna do about Riggins, man? What do you want me to do? The dude tried to beat up a guy in a wheelchair. That's as low as it gets. I thought you were captain. Captains are supposed to be leaders. Step on him. All right, man? Let's do something about this. Hi, Lyla. Garrity? Garrity? Yo, Garrity, just hold up. - Hi, Tyra. - So I heard... - What'd you hear? - Jason punched out Tim. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. I heard you were there. Yeah, I was. So why'd he do it? I don't know. Maybe just a misunderstanding. You know guys. Oh, yeah, misunderstandings. That's funny. The rumors are flying, just so you're aware. Yeah, well, I'm sure they're not true. Right, well, I didn't even tell you what they were. You know, I know you and Tim have been spending a lot of time together. I got a-- I got ethics class, so I gotta go. Right. I was wondering if you could give me a little help - on this hotel situation. - What hotel situation, Mayor? For this Friday night. Gatling isn't exactly... rolling out the welcome wagon. Seems they want to put us up in the Cheyenne Motel. At the risk of sounding like a snob, I don't want to get shot in a drive-by this weekend, is all. Call me crazy. I don't think there's any worry of that though. That's  not necessary. Anyway, there's a meeting set up tomorrow night, to work this whole thing through. Problem is, I've got a prior commitment. Left  solely in Buddy Garrity's hands, this whole thing could spin way out of control. Buddy can be a tad abrasive when I'm not there to be the yin to his yang, as it were. Tami. Tami, you are the perfect person for this job. - Oh, come-- - What do you say? You want me to be Buddy Garrity's yang? Yin, actually. - Well, I don't-- - No, you would be wonderful. You'd be wonderful. Oh, well, I don't think I-- - You know, that-- - Oh, thank you so much! I'll see you all Friday night, right? Oh, well then-- Oh, Tami... wear something pretty. And, you know... And, uh... You'll have 'em eating out of your hand. Oh, all right, well, I'll, um... That's... Babe, got things to do. Honey... A yin and a-- I don't understand what I'm even doing, honey! Can I just say that you're choosing to date a football player? - Like, voluntarily? - He's Matt. - He's not a football player. - He's starting quarterback. But, I mean, he doesn't buy into the whole jock thing. He's normal. Relatively. Yeah, well, we'll see how long that lasts. You are so jaded. People change. Fast. Especially when they're on the team. You know, you gotta make a change, my friend. This is extremely important. This isn't just a first date, this... This is your-- your pre-release party. - My what? - We're on the brink here. I mean, Dillon is a .500 team right now, but you beat Gatling this Friday-- which, good luck with that, by the way-- and then you're a winning team again, which is just instant rock star status. All--all these things are older than we are. Well, it's called retro, and the chicks dig it, trust me. Oh, I forgot you're such an expert about that. Your last girlfriend was what, Jenny Emil? That was like fifth grade or something? I mean, that's fine. If you wanna get personal, I mean, you know, that still hurts. And it was, you know, it was a bad breakup. So thank you for bringing that back up. - I appreciate that. - Sorry. That's fine, I mean, I'm just trying to help you out, and you wanna get all personal. All right, well then, let's get back to helping me out and stop this heart-to-heart. - No, no, no! - What's wrong with these? This is something that Matt Saracen would wear. Julie Taylor's about to go on her first date with a football player. She doesn't want the man, she wants the myth. So you gotta pull out your big guns here, buddy. Now tell me, can you say... "Members Only"? Junior Silverio is the key to the Gatling defense. We shut him down, we shut down this team. Pudnick, get you up here. This is him right here. And it would be him too. If he was bigger, stronger, and could actually tackle, it would be him. Now look, we're not gonna run from this guy. We are gonna go through this bump. We're gonna punch a hole  right through the heart of this Eagles defense, you understand? - Yes, sir! - It is going to be a war. And we're gonna make a statement that's gonna lead us all the way to State! - Yes, sir! - Bring it in. Let's go, let's go! One, two, three! Panthers! - What's up, Street? - What's up, fellas? Me and the guys wanted to come by. - How are you, man? - Oh, yeah. How you doing? Ain't y'all supposed to be getting ready for Gatling this week? Yeah, man. Been getting Saracen killed back there, I hear. You got my message, man? Yeah, yeah. I got your message. If there's one thing we don't allow, it's for somebody to hit our quarterback. Riggins didn't hit me. I hit him. And I am fine. So... Don't make anything of it, all right? Where did all the pictures on the wall go, man? Just, uh...I been here for a while, man. You know, just wanted to change things up, you know? The nurse outside told us that we're your first visitors today. Where's Lyla? She just not around, or what? - Busy. - Yeah? Riggins  and Lyla? You know me and the guys always got your back. We're gonna take care of this, man. Look, i'm just asking you to watch her for a couple hours, okay? I'll give you Julie's number. It's just... she doesn't like... the idea of being alone at night, so... You know, I'm-- I'm really thrilled about the idea of being left alone with your grandmother at night. You know how I feel about the whole situation. Landry, my grandma is not a witch. Okay? She's just not. Hey, Matt. Come here. Hey, Lance, how you doin'? Uh, it's--it's Landry. - Huh? Yeah. - It's Landry. Listen, can I talk to you for a second? Uh, yeah. What's--what's up, Coach? Big date night tonight? Oh, yeah, but, uh... I'm gonna have her home early, right after the movie. Oh, I know you will. I know you will. What's going on with Riggins? Uh...what do you mean? What I mean is, I have eyes. I wanna know what's going on out there. You--all due respect, sir, I just don't really feel it's my place to say anything, so I'm gonna-- I'm--I'm not going to. You know what, I appreciate your allegiance to your teammates, but you're also team captain. So if there's somethin' going on out there that's gonna affect his game Friday night, I suggest that you tell me. - Well, it's-- it's just a rumor. - What kind of rumor? Somethin' about somebody he hooked up with. Or--maybe. - Someone he hooked up with? - And I don't even think it's true, - so that's why I don't really want-- - Who is it? Spit it out. Doesn't need to be anything between us, spit it out. With Lyla. Lyla Garrity? Yeah. All right. - Can I go now? - Yeah, have a good time at the movies. Hey--my daughter and I talk a lot. Okay. Hey, Jordanna called. They invited us to a barbeque tomorrow, when we get to Gatling. Hold up. You're gonna put Brian and Junior in the same room? Look, they may be enemies on the field, but  off the field, the Silverios are still some of our best friends. Huh, well, why'd you move us away from them? - Because Dillon is safer, that's why. - Yeah, and whiter, too. You move us to Dillon to get us out of the ghetto? Or to get us away from Dad? You don't know what you're talking about. No, I really want to bring it up. Like, we--we should talk about this. You need to shut your mouth. - Mama, I'm serious-- - Take your smart mouth and your plate and get away from my table. You don't talk to me like that. - Hey. - Evening, Coach. Wait, wait, wait. Is that a Members Only jacket? Uh...yeah, what-- what do you think? You think it's okay? Hey, Matt. How are you? Come on in. I'm fine. How are you doing, ma'am? - Great. You look nice. - Well, thank you. Um...is--is Julie here? Is she ready? Hey, Matt. Hi--hi. - Uh-uh. - All right. Um, you know what? - You look really nice. - Thanks. Let me just have a quick word with little Jules. Why don't y'all go wait in the living room? And, um... We'll just be a-- just a sec, okay? All right. Just come on, just for one second. Why don't you take your Members Only jacket off - and hang it on the coat rack? - Sorry, what? Hang your jacket up, Matt. Oh, yeah. This is not actually what you're gonna wear on your date. But this is what people wear on dates. Not that other dress. I know, but baby, this is not what you wear on dates. And you can't even walk in those shoes. Come on. I love you. Come on. You want a beer? Uh, no thanks. I'm driving. I was joking. So, um, have you heard good things about the movie? Oh, yeah, one of my people recommended it, so... You mean Landry? Yeah. Uh, can I get-- Can I just get two for Eragon, please? I'm sorry, sir. Eragon is sold out. Oh, I'm Matt Saracen. QB1? Quarterback? And...? And I thought that you held tickets for football players. Not since Reyes started a fight in the balcony. It took three security guards - to break that one up. - Yeah, but he's not on the team anymore, so it's-- - it's okay. - Hello? You can give me those tickets. Uh...yeah. Yeah, yeah, just a second. Matt, it's, um-- Your people is calling. Huh? Hello? Whoa, I told you, if anything goes wrong, just turn on the Discovery Channel. She'll be all right. Okay, okay. All right, all right. I'll be right there. Um, we gotta go back to my house. Look, um, I'm really sorry that we had to come back here, it's just-- - It's only going to take like a second, so I'll-- - Okay, look, look, look, I-I swear I did not touch her. We were watching TV, and she just started flipping out. Where is she? She's in the clos--she locked herself in the closet. - What closet? - Right over here. Gr--Grandma? I'm gonna come in, okay? I'm not gonna let him touch me like that! - I did not touch her-- - I know, it's fine. Um, Grandma, I'm gonna have to come in there, okay? I want Joel. I want Joel. - She's asking for Joel-- - Yeah, it's my grandfather. - Your grandpa's been dead for six years-- - I know, I know that. Joel... I want Joel... I want Joel... Dar--darling? - Are you-- are you in there, darling? - Joel, is that you? Oh, it's--it's me. Hey, sweetheart. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna need you to come out of there, okay? Joel. Sing to me. Sing our song. * Mist--Mister Sandman * * Bring me a dream * * Make her complexion Like peaches and cream  * * And then I'll know my lonely nights are over * * Sandman.. * Sandman.. * I'm all alone * * So please turn on your magic beam * * Sandman, bring me a dream * * Bum bum bum bum bum bum * * Mister Sandman * * Bring me a dream * * Make her the sweetest That I've ever seen * That's-- that's our song. Oh, that's how we do it. Oh, Joel. - Oh, that bed looks good. - There you go. See you in my dreams, okay? - I love you. - I love you too. O kay? Mister Sandman. You better get sweet dreams, so he can come. You get some sleep. I'll--I'll just get Landry to take me home. Okay. Ly-ly? You in there? Comin' in, precious. Honey... You didn't come down for breakfast. You're late for school, honey. Carpe diem. Daddy, I'll be right down, okay? Okay. Seems like you got home mighty early from your date last night. How was the movie? Was it good or... You realize we can't talk about these kind of things, right? Oh, right sorry. I lost my head. I apologize. We never went to a movie. And, no, we weren't parked somewhere or anything. Matt just got a call, and he needed to help out his grandma. Sorry about that. It was...sort of okay. It was like... the first time I actually go to see the real Matt Saracen. I totally blew it. And that stupid jacket didn't help any. Well, Matt, there's no reason to blame the couture. - Just 'cause you couldn't pull it off. - I end up singing to my grandma. Look, all I asked you to do was watch her for a couple hours-- Okay, listen, Casanova. You singing to your grandma was probably the only thing that you did right. - Oh, yeah? Why is that? - Well, I mean, Julie totally bought it. She told me so on the way home. What'd she say? Well, she said that it was sweet. And vulnerable. Sweet and vulnerable? That's what she said? Great, sweet and vulnerable is like a kitten, Landry, not a boyfriend. Well, calm down, I mean, you gotta-- you gotta take what you got and work with it. You know, drop the whole quarterback macho thing. You clearly can't pull that one off. And, you know, you use the sensitive, artistic thing. So you think there actually might still be a chance that she's kind of maybe like, a little bit-- Singing to your grandma may be the one thing that gets you into Julie Taylor's funhouse. What? Don't tell me you haven't thought about that. That's--that-- that's just wrong. We're just gonna have to tell those people that they're gonna have to provide first class accommodations for us, just like we gave them when they came here, and it's as simple as that. That's what we do. Well, I think, you know, it's gonna be important not to put them  on the defensive. And I'm not sure that that's gonna be the best way for us to get what we want. Oh, Tammy, you know how these people are. Oh. - Well-- - They don't-- they don't like us. But I still think that we might wanna just give it a little bit of a different approach. Just sort of, you know, tip it on its head a little bit, if you know what I mean. I know. I know. I see why my daughter loves you, though. She speaks so highly of you. - Aww...she's a sweet girl. - Yeah. Have you seen anything lately with her, anything different? She got some big problem or something? Well, um... She's not eating, and she just seems... distracted. You know, I'm thinking maybe it's just that... teenage girl thing. But I--what do I know? I think, as a parent, best thing you can do is, uh... just don't try to fix it. Just--just be there for her. Just let her know you love her. That's good. You know, you and I are gonna make a great team. Because I can tell you just kill 'em with kindness. Okay. I'll put a little pressure on 'em, and see if we can squeeze some nicer digs out of 'em. Oh, okay. All right, then. You need to get the lead out of your ass before Friday. Come on, let's go. Push! Don't worry. I'll be ready for prime time, just like Dad taught me. Would you shut up about Dad and stop bringing him up? Look, we going to the city where he died. And I don't know why we're not allowed to talk about him. - Don't you think that's weird? - No. Mom might hate him, but that don't mean I do. Seven. I remember the guy who taught me how to throw a spiral. - And took us fishing. - Your point is? And gave me my nickname after I crashed my bike into the water heater. Well, you know what? I remember other things, Brian. Don't matter, Sheila. He was our dad. I don't see what the big mystery is. The only mystery is how you can move your mouth so fast, but your legs are moving so slow. Come on. Brian, let's go. Oh, my God, Brian! Breathe, breathe! Breathe. Yeah, clean as a whistle. Yeah, at this point, I'm thinking it's just anxiety. You been under any stress lately? Yeah. We got a big game coming up on Friday. Oh, yeah. Gatling defense. - Yeah. - I'd be stressing too. Just get some rest, okay, and you'll be fine. And take it to 'em, okay? - Yes, sir. - All right. Thanks. See? No big deal. So just chill. Oh, please don't tell me to chill. Since when did you start having anxiety attacks? You know I always get excited before games. Did your face always break out too? Look... You either tell me what's going on, or Mom's gonna find out. Come on. Look, it's just some pick-me-ups I've been taking. I got it from my trainer. It's all legit. Pick-me-ups? What, from some fake bodybuilder at some stupid gym? Look, don't check me on this, all right? I know what I'm doing. It's just gonna give me a little edge. Boy, since the time you were 9 years old, it's been all about you. You never have to do anything around the house, - Sheila... - just so you can practice. Somebody's gotta step up and be the man of the house now that Dad's not around. You are gonna get into trouble. Do you not understand this? Look, Sheila, let me just-- let me just be clear with you, all right? Football is my life. That's all I got in this world. I need your help. Are we cool? For now. All right. Hyuh! - Coach. - How you doing? Good. Better than you. You got Gatling this weekend. Well, you know what? We're gonna be patient with the offense. We're gonna take what we can, is what we're gonna do. I know you're busy, but I just wanted to let you know I played in that scrimmage the other night. And, uh... think I did pretty well. I heard you did. I heard you threw the ball well. And I heard you gave 'em hell. And I'm sorry I couldn't have been there. Did you, uh... did you hear anything else? Yeah. Yeah, I heard. Sorry I laid your fullback out. You all right? You know, it's just you think you... you think you know someone. And then you don't. Just don't. I didn't come here to talk about that. But I want you to know that, you know, you don't have to be alone with it either. I want you to know that. Oh, thank you. I understand. I appreciate it. Anybody but her! Your brother's a jackass. I hope Lyla was worth it, little brother. Whoo! You have the best barbecue I've ever tasted in Gatling. And I swear, if you ever repeat that to anybody, I will deny, deny, deny. But it is-- we don't have anything that comes close to that in Dillon. - Oh, we know. - Oh, I'm sure you do. Ah, Dwight, can you just quite flirting with the coach's wife. Unless you're getting down to business right here, all right? Now, this roach motel, fleabag motel, just ain't gonna fly. Put us in a wing. Just rent a wing at the Remington. And we can just move on from there. And here's another thing-- The Remington is a five-star hotel, buddy. That's not even a start. You know what? When we bring that entire town of Dillon over here, which you know is gonna happen, this place is gonna be sold out. Concession business is gonna go through the roof. Now, I bet if you picked up the phone and called the hotel and explained that to them, they would bring those rates down. You sure you don't coach football? I leave that to my husband. Hey. To, uh, to what do I owe this visit? Oh, nothing, really. I just, um... figured we're the only two left in town. So...stopped by to rent a movie. Then...I had a better idea. I figured, what the hell. Yeah? What else am I doing tonight? Oh, hey, Corrina! Hit me, baby. - Hey, Junior. - What's up man? - Long time no see. - What up, dog? Don't eat it. Whenever you have a barbecue in the hood, everybody just show up at your house? Yeah. But, hey... remember Tony Corwin? Yeah. Doing a bid for 10. Armed robbery. - Damn. - Seems like you and me are just about the only guys from the hood that got a decent shot. But, you know, coming back here just some-- It just opens up old wounds. Michael was the reason we stayed here. And after he died, I thought it was better for us to leave. I hate to admit it, girl, but sometimes, I don't even miss him. I know I don't miss staying up late at night, wondering whether he coming home or not. I actually think we might be better off with him dead. Brian. Brian! Baby! That was awful! Well, come on. Do it again. - Yeah! - Oh, my God. No way. "Here's to good friends in Texas." "Texas forever." "I'm the perfect Lyla Garrity!" "Go, Panthers!" God. Can you believe that's all these people talk about? You think you'll ever forgive him? Will you ever forgive her? Here's to real friends in Texas. Amen. Lord have mercy. You know you missed bed check. I know. I'll talk to coach and smooth things out. - But where you been? - I went to go see the old house. I'm sorry, Mama. Let me ask you something. What all do you remember about that night? - Dad's accident? - Mm-hmm. I remember it was late, and Dad was coming home from work by himself. And...some lady ran a red light, and he never stood a chance. Uncle Rookie showed me the pictures once. You're right. It was late at night. But he wasn't coming home from work, and he wasn't by his self. - Who was he with? - Doesn't matter. You don't know, and I didn't either. Now, your daddy wasn't a perfect man. Lord knows we had our share of problems. But I just need you to know... that I loved him. And he loved you. I know I still get angry sometimes. And then I get sad, and then I... I say stupid stuff like I did tonight. He'd have been so proud of you. There wasn't a person in the world your daddy couldn't charm. You got that from him. I just thank God... you got the best parts of him. Please welcome the Dillon Panthers! And now, your own Gatling Eagles! Y'all goin' down! Y'all on the wrong side of town now! This is my home! Yo! That's what I'm talkin' 'bout! Y'all ain't ready! Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, baby. Let's go! Get 'em out of here, guys! Guys, get 'em the hell out of here! Come on. Let's go. Let's put our heads together right now. We knew this is what was coming. And we knew this is what they were gonna bring. Now let's go give it right back to 'em. - You understand me? - Yes, sir! Play smart tonight! - Smash! - Hey, I'm right here, coach. Take them out. This ain't their house, this is my house! My field! My blood is in this house! They wanna live the pain, we gonna give 'em pain! We takin' this house back tonight! You talk about slobber-knocker football, this has been one ferocious match-up. A defensive battle..</i> And here we are in the fourth quarter, deadlocked at zero, zero.</i> Smash Williams has been shut down. Saracen's been contained.</i> And Tim Riggins has been beaten like an old rug.</i> And the punishment has been handed out by Gatling's huge middle linebacker, Junior Silverio. First and ten on their own 12. Saracen hands off on the run to Smash. Oh, and he's hit immediately by Silverio! Junior Silverio on the tackle. Saracen drops back. He's got Smash Williams open on the left for a screen.</i> Ohh! And he's hit by Silverio again. Silverio again on the side. Put him on his back, right now! You put him on his back! They have to be careful here, standing near their own goal line. Oh, and Riggins is hit!! He's hit by Silverio for a safety. And that is two points for the Gatling Eagles! And it may not be pretty, folks, but it might be enough, and--</i> Hold on, hold on. Looks like-- Looks like Riggins is hurt. Being helped off the field by Smash. And it does not look good. It has just gone from bad to worse here for Coach Taylor.</i> Hey, slut, Riggins is over here. Riggins is that way! What are you gonna do, huh? How was Riggins? We heard about it. Hey, Lyla, does Riggins prefer boxers or briefs? - What are they saying? - I don't know, I can't... Who's next? Eeny, meeny, miny, moe! You get around, girl. Hey! What was that? Ohh! Damn, bitch. What the hell is going on? I don't know. I'm going down there. Wait, wait, wait. This one's me. This one's me. I'll be right back, babe. I'll take care of this. 25-yard kickoff return by... I'll be back. First and ten, Gatling from their own 40-yard-line.</i> Honey, what happened out there? What's going on? You gotta tell me, baby. What is it? - I lost Jason. - What? I was unfaithful, Daddy. Well... We all... make mistakes. And we--we grow up. But you're my little girl. You're my daughter, and I want you to always remember that. You've never left a game before. It's only a game. You're my daughter. All right, offense on me! On me, listen up now. Listen, we got one more shot at this. Let's make it count. You understand? Let's go get 'em! Let's go! Let's go! Riggins! It's time for you to give the best you got. - You got one more in you? - Yes, sir. All right, then. Let's go. Well, this is all she wrote, folks. Taylor has 13 seconds left to work with. Hold on a second.</i> The big Tim Riggins is coming onto the field!</i> He is really digging deep here tonight. and showing his teammates what he's made of.</i> Way to tough it out, Rig. All right, Rig. Do this. Let's go, gentlemen. Guys, listen up. We're going pro, right, 28, shovel. On one. Ready? Now, the Dillon faithful are on their feet.</i> Let's see if Coach Taylor can put some lipstick on this pig.</i> Blue 80! Get ready! Get ready, Smash! Blue! 38! Hut! He pitches it off to Smash! Oh, and Silverio's got him in his sights! Oh! Oh! And he has laid down on Tim Riggins! And he has sprung! Smash Williams do the left side! Do you believe in miracles, folks?! Because I just saw one! Touchdown! Dillon Panthers! And that is the ball game! Dillon wins! Dillon wins!!</i> That was a great game! Um...I gotta go. How's your shoulder? - I'll live. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah, you will. Come here, baby. Let's go home, mama. Let's go home. - Yes, baby, let's go home. - Let's go home. Let's go home.
