- You let the damn team down. - I'll do whatever it takes to stay. - Santiago has been working for me. - This is a boy who needs a home. - He should move in with me. - First real bed I ever had. I like you. A lot. You have not grown up yet. And you are not rid me yet, you hear? Go to hell! I got this secret. And it's startin' to literally eat away at me. Just tell the truth. I need to speak to someone about the murder of Mike Caldwell. I killed him. And I went inside to get the food, and she stayed outside. As soon as I heard what was happening, I dropped the bag and I ran out and I just started hitting him. You stepped in to help your friend, is that it? I wanted to kill him. Yeah, but he was actually hurting the girl, right? I picked up a pipe from the ground and I ran over. I hit him twice in the head as hard as I could. Now listen. I'm gonna go get a tape recorder, all right? And I'm gonna be right back. Stay put. Chad. The boy is not helping himself out in there. - Dad, what exactly are you doing? - We're goin' home We really weren't done talking in there. We just need to go and figure some things out, son. There's not anything to figure out. I'm here to confess, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. We didn't finish what we're doing. - If we please go back in here. - Son, listen to me. Detective Tamber's trying to help you out here. I don't need to be helped out. I need you to come back in here so I can finish telling you what... what it is... I'm not gonna go anywhere. I'm not... I came here to confess - and that's exactly... - You're goin' home. You're goin' home. Now! Let's go! - I'm not done telling you... - Let's go! I love you, bud. Let's go home. 2x09: THE CONFESSION Transcript: www.swsub.com & RaceMan www.forom.com Subtitles: GillesSilb, Ju, Sixe Matthew. Did you eat my Snackwells? My Snackwells! Grandma, it's probably late for you to be eating snacks. Well, I want you to ask Carlotta if she ate the Snackwells. - You want me to ask her now? - Well, no. In the morning! Gettin' kinda tired of this. You stole my grandma's Snackwells. You probably ate 'em too. First you take the tapioca... - Did I wake you up? - Hi, Gracie. Sweetheart, will you please make sure that you call today? Call the party rental place today and make sure that they are not late. - Before coming, you've got to shave. - It's the 3rd time you've asked. Mom, are these organic apples? I doubt it seriously, they were on sale. I asked for organic apples. Are you going to go shopping for the christening dress? And you've got the flowers? - You're gonna clean up your room, - Do you trust me to clean up my room? I'm not gonna honor that with a response. You just need to chill out. This christening thing is not that big of a deal. It is a big deal because first, you're the godmother. Second, we've got family comin' in from out of town. It's your sister, and it's our family, and it's a big deal. I'm not only the coach around here, but I'm also the director of the athletic program. And I've been brainstorming 'cause the other departments are woefully understaffed. And I have been looking for someone who owes me a favor. Someone who has been disrespectful and has shown a great deal of selfishness. Can you think of anyone off the top of your head? Top of my head, first guy that comes to mind is probably Williams. You know what? I got a lot on my plate right now, Riggins. But I thank you very much for volonteering. And where we can start is with the girls' varsity soccer ball uniforms. - And they are mighty dirty. - So I'm just doing laundry now? It ain't gonna do itself. You know what? Don't even try and show me that screech porn again 'cause little piece of me dies... Hey, listen, man. I got somethin' else for ya. It's a dating web site. - No way. - Hey, prudy, come on, man. It's wheellovers.com, man. It's bona fide. I'm tellin' you right- I'm sure there are lookers. They gotta be heifers. Take a gander. Take a gander. Come on, man. - Isabella. Stop on Isabella. - Forget her. I'm looking for Charmaine. Normal looking, which is a shocker. Charmaine got a link to her myspace page. - Wait, don't go there yet. - Blow! She got the camouflage panties. You can't see 'em cause they're camouflaged. - Is that your sister? - Don't make it weird, man. Now I ain't able to look at it. I just thought I'd bring you boys a snack. What was I just saying about carrot sticks? I love carrot sticks. - He loves carrot sticks. - Thank you so much. Hand 'em over. Just let me know if you need anything else. Will do. - Carrots and cookies. - Beta-carotene: good for ya. Party time. You gotta get out of this place, man. He runs 4', 4'40, benches 330 pounds. When he comes to the quarterback, it looks like he's standing still. - It sounds like the second coming. - Hallelujah. How about it, kid? You walk on water? You rain down fumbles from above? And you may play a lot friday night too, Santiago. Be prepared. Landry went down to the police station and confessed the murder last night. We're meeting with a lawyer, and you'll need one too. This guy's a... good criminal defense attorney. Just have your mom call me when she gets home - if you'll need help with the fees. - What's gonna happen to Landry? I don't know. Looking good! Riggins! - Back on the football team, huh? - Looks like it. Yeah. So long as when you realize return to the herd is the biggest mistake of your life. Don't tell me I didn't tell you so. Okay. I won't. You idiot. Your dad told me what you did. Why? 'Cause it was the right thing to do. I don't understand it, but I... I just can't keep lying. I wish I could but... I can't. Come on, let's go, D! Let's go, D! Come on, Santiago. Take that block on. Did we not have this goin' last week? We were doin' fine last week. What's different last week and now? You contain 'em on the outside, don't you? You key off the back to see if he rushed the passer. If he holds that ball: jailbreak. You go after the quarterback, you understand that? Do you understand that? - Can I have a verbal response, please? - Yes, Coach. Good. Thank you. Now let's see you do it. - What's wrong with my boy? - You know, he's got great instincts until you put him in first D. He's having a bad day. We all have a bad day. An outside linebacker can get it done, and I don't think he's it. To tell you the truth, I think it's his head, and that scares me. Things can go in vastly different directions on this. What do you mean? He could be trialed as an adult for murder, or he can be let out on probation. It all depends on how we frame it. What exactly does that mean, to frame it? Well, the legal definition is defense of another. If you reasonably believe that it was necessary to hit that man with the pipe to protect your friend from serious injury or death, - then there's no crime. - Well, I killed him, sir. Necessary to protect someone from serious injury or death. Those are the magic words that we need to focus on. Why do I need magic words to try and make me look good for this? - Do you not understand what I'm saying? - Landry, I understand very well. I don't need to frame this to make me look good when the matter is that I killed this man. I understand that. I've got the record right here. But when I use the word frame, don't think of it in a negative sense. They can't catch him. He's too fast. He scores! Hey, stranger. - What brings you by here? - Just drivin' by. It's my favorite Christian in the neiborhood. One second. Yeah, go ahead. Hello. Yeah, speaking. Oh, hey, hi, Isabella. Yeah. No, it's great to... It's great to actually hear your voice, yeah. No, this weekend is... Yeah, that's fine. Okay. That sounds good to me. All right, talk to you later. Bye. - Shut up. - So who's Isabella? She's just a friend of Herc's. It's kinda like a setup thing. - Oh, really? - Oh, yeah, it is, actually. - Are you smitten? - No. I'm not smitten. We haven't even met yet. We're gonna go out this weekend for the first time, you know. I might've seen a picture. That's very cool. Hey. Hey. What are you doing in here? You said we weren't supposed to see each other at school. This is an exception. I need to talk to you. That sounds great. Sit down then. What can I do for you? Okay, so it's about mom and the whole baby christening thing. - She's going off the rails. - What do you mean? You've seen her yelling about cupcakes, and party decorations and foldig chairs... It's very important to her. And I realize it's an important day, and for Grace. But I just... I don't know. I feel like I'm going to disappoint her or something. What do you mean "disappoint her"? I feel like... I don't know. I mean, I want to help. I really do. But I just feel like she's asking me to do a million things at once. I have to keep up with my schoolwork. And I'm practising for my SAT's, and I have dance class, and I write for the school paper. All right, you know what I'll do? I'll talk to her. - Really? - That surprise you? Thanks. I appreciate it. You're welcome. - You doing all right? - Not really. We just hit a 8.6, Coach. Stacey should be hitting those double backs. She's been her own worst enemy all day. It's pretty bad. Go, Dillon! Go, Panthers! Let's go, Panthers, let's go! Who is this guy? That's my roommate. Get him over to the bleachers. Step over to the bleachers. It's a nice gig, man. - No. It's not a nice gig. - You seen this blonde in that outfit? You know? You gotta let me, man. All right, let's get out of here then. Go down to the landin' strip. Early bird special. Check out Mindy's new... I can't go to the landing strip. I gotta stay here till it's done. Cool. I can stay, man. I love me some acrobats. Look at these girls, man. You kiddin' me? Let's go, Dillon! So... It's third and short. It's an obvious run situation. What defense you gonna be in? Dime or prevent? - Dime? - No. Neither. Trick question. I got you. Hey, how much of this book do I need to know by tomorrow? All of it. Comin' up, somethin' I invented here. Steak and ramencini. Julie came into the office today to talk to me. She did? What about? I think she's trying to help you out, but she thinks that you don't understand that, because she's got so much going on. She feels overextended for all the things you're giving her. She's got her homework. She's got school. She's got... - What things? What? - Just the things that she... I mean... You're giving her a lot to do, I think. And she doesn't know how to deal with everything. And she feels that... Wait a minute. She went into your office to talk to you about how I'm giving her too much to do? I mean, you realize that I don't think that's what that's really about? 'Cause I'll tell you right now. If our laughter Julie who goes to school and comes home, is overextended, that's not the girl we want to be raising, if she can't help out when we've got a big family weekend coming up. I hope you were clear with her about that. I told her just about everything you said. I'm sure you did. Son, can you turn off the music? I just wanna talk. Look, I realize that you're mad. - I realize that that you don't think - I'm not mad at you. - I can handle the consequences. - No, I can't handle it. If you go to prison, it'll break my heart. - It'll completely destroy your mother. - I'm not gonna lie about this, dad. Why is it a lie? You didn't even know the man was there until you heard Tyra screaming. And when you came out, he was attacking her. What about the fact that he was walking away? Where does that come in to play? Didn't you try to save him? That's what you told me. Son, this man raped five other young women. You and Tyra were fearful for your own lives. This was self-defense. Mornin', Coach Thought I'd get a head start on laundry and whatever else you need me to do. This sudden work ethic of yours doesn't have anything to do with your living situation, does it? Okay. How you doin'? Smash, you gotta stop giving away the store, man. They don't count the ice cream. It's okay. Don't worry about it. Have a good one. Hey, how you doin'? - Oh, Smash, I got this. - No, no. I got this. My name's Brian Williams, - but my good friends call me Smash. - Oh, nice to meet you. But actually, I wanted to talk to Matt. You think you can make me a rocket launcher with jimmies, please? He's gonna make some ice cream. What are you doin' here? - Grandma was in a burger mood. - No, you're a liar. - No, she did. - No, she didn't. You wanted to see me. Oh, thank you, sir. - I can't eat this. - Yeah, you can. It's all for you. - I'm gonna go work on grandma's burger. - Okay. My God. That's the girl livin' at your house? It's your graduation day, fool. - Shut up. - Smash taught you well. - Smash didn't teach me nothin'. - The only sad thing is: you're right in the middle of something too good to last. - What are you talking about? - 'Cause this a situation with no rules. Women like boundaries, okay? They always want to define things. No, but she's different, she ain't like that. Listen. You want this thing to last? You need to set some ground rules. Tyra, I feel like I'm choosing between jail or hell. Will you please just tell me the truth? Were you in fear for your life? Were you honestly in fear for your life, Tyra? He would've raped me. He could... He coulda killed me... if you hadn't been there... You saved me. So you're ready for the game tonight? You may see some playin' time tonight, son. - What the hell's the point of all this? - What'd you say, Santiago? - I can't do it. - What? What do you care if I play, huh? You don't know me. You're not my pops! You don't know nothin' about me. You're just some fat white guy who wants to make himself feel good. And I don't need nothin' from you, all right? I don't need your car dealership and I sure as hell don't need football! Shut that door. Shut the door! I'll tell you what, you want to go back to that cafeteria eatin' off of plastic with 200 guys goin' nowhere, you be my guest, son. Now listen to me. Tonight is your night. You have an opportunity to go out there and accept the challenge. You have the opportunity to become part of a team. If you don't do it tonight, then you're never gonna do it in your entire life. Now, I'm goin' to the field. So you get out, be my guest. I hate you. I hate you all. I'm so glad that y'all are gonna make it. I know. Good, good, good. We'll see you. Bye-bye. Okay. So this is the godmother dress. Obviously this is another thing I did wrong. Well, sweetie, I'm just... I like it. I think maybe, you know, if... So tell me what you want me to wear, I will put it on. Tell me what to wear. - Don't do that. - Do what? What you're doing. - What am I doing? - Let's get something straight. It's been difficult since Gracie came into this family. But it's time for you to rise up and to grow up. It's not about Gracie. This has nothing to do with Gracie. I would love to grow up. Why don't you let me? I'm not doing anything to keep you from growing up. OK, so according to you, I can't dress myself, I can't pick my own friends, I can't make my own plans. I can't even go to the mall and pick out a dress with Shelly. Everything I do is wrong. You know that's not true. So somebody can take a picture at this christening with your perfect little family and your perfect little baby? I'm not trying to make everybody different. I am trying to get you to grow up into the person that I know that I raised into this family, and the beautiful girl that you are. I'm acting a lot more grownup than you are. - Don't scream. - I think you're the one who started. You have been absent ever since that baby was born. Don't tell me... Don't you scream in front of the baby. Don't you dare tell me I'm not helping out. Do you know how many things I've done for you? Do you know how many things I've done for you? A thank you would be nice. That's all I'm asking for. Well, I think a thank you would be nice too. So why did you attack Mike Caldwell on august 15, 2007? I thought he was going to kill my friend. He was attacking her, and it didn't look like he was gonna stop. I was in fear for my life. So I tried to be a vegan when I was 14. - How long did that last? - Like six hours. - That's longer than I'd be able to do. - It was awful. I'm from Texas so... Would it be awkward if I was to ask you why exactly you posted on the web site? Well, is it awkward if I ask you why you were browsing it? Yeah, kind of. Kinda. - You all done with these? - Yeah. Thank you. I see your point. I'll refrain from asking that question. It's no big deal. I guess I just want to find guys who are more open-minded. That is stupid. Good answer. No. No. Completely understand. Can I be honest with you? - Of course. - Can I tell you what gets me going? Sure. Pee. Excuse me for a minute? Excuse me. Could you do me a favor? Could you tell the lady that I had... There's an urgent family matter I had to attend? If the date's not going well, just say something. - I'm not gonna help you ditch her. - I'm not trying to ditch her. You completely misunderstand. She's not your type, fine. Be honest with her so you can both move forward. I met this girl on a web site and now she's talkin' about pee and I'm not exactly comfortable with where it's goin'. What? - Care for dessert? - I'll wait for my friend to get back. Your friend left. - Excuse me? - Yeah. He left. I'm sorry, you must be mistaken, 'cause he's in a wheelchair and I drove. I'm sorry, he did. So he just left the restaurant and started wheelin' down the road? - Honey, I don't have any idea. - Whoa, don't honey me. Don't ever... - Calm down. Ma'am, calm down. - You want me to calm down? Hey Rig, you getting crunked over there? Let's go! I tell you what, this four hood quarterback, JD Pepper</i> has lived up to his billing as Mr Untouchable.</i> The Panther defense has yet to get a saddle on Pepper</i> as he's s thrown strikes from the pocket all night long,</i> scoring touchdowns on three of four possessions.</i> Pepper lets one go. And touchdown for Hood! As the cougars pull further ahead, 28 to 13, that ends the second quarter. Coach Taylor has got to shake up his defense for the second half,</i> and find somebody who's gonna put pressure on their quarterback</i> or that Pepper train's gonna keep on rolling.</i> Coach. Mac said you wanted to talk to me. Here's what I got to tell ya. I'd like for you to play Santiago. He's not ready to get in the game. He is a street fighter. You never know until you put him in the ring. Give the kid a chance. I'm askin'. Is that it? I'll take it into consideration. Anyone who's expecting a second half adjustment from coach Taylor</i> is sorely disappointed. as the JD Pepper hilight reel</i> continues at the expense of this gizmo Dillon defense.</i> Santiago! Come here. Come here. Get your helmet on. You're goin' in. Get your ass in there. Let's go. Come on! Come on, 59! Let's go, girls. Time to step it up, right now! 4-3, wide eyes, outside diamond. Ready? - You ready? - Ready! Don't come this way, bitch, or I'll knock your ass out again. You gotta hit him! You gotta hit him! Wake up! It's time for you to wake up! You hear me? Cover 4. Cover 4. Ready? Get it! Get the ball! Get the ball! Get the ball! All right. Here we go. All right. Here we go! Here we go! You' going back in! Good game, Smash. Good game, guys. Santiago. You won that game, son. - No. I just... - Listen to me. Listen to me. You changed the momentum of the game. You brought the magic. And, uh... About earlier in the car, that was cold. No, no. Thank you. For what? Thank you. - So I opened the door. - Right. And he is completely covered in leather. I mean, head to toe. Oh, yeah. He had the shoes. He had the pants, the vest, the jacket, little biker hat. - He's a winner. - That's a winner. But I have to ask you: Did he have to go number one? Yoou are pretty competitive in the whole bad date arena, aren't you? I'm always competitive about everything. And as far as this arena goes, it's no contest, I win. Okay. Fine. Okay, you win. I'll give it to you this time. All right. You really saved my ass tonight. No problem. Do you think we should... talk about maybe some ground rules? - What? - You know, just... Kinda just put the fish on the table so that we both so that we both know what's goin' on, how we each feel, that way no one'll get hurt. Smash kinda had this point about how if we don't both... I think I wanna teach you how to make mole. - Okay. - Okay. Good night, Matt. - Tim. - Oh, God! You forgot to feed the ferrets. Put it down. You forgot to feed the ferrets. What'd I say you had to do to stay here? I told you to feed the ferrets. I'm sorry. - Put it down. - Got you. You should've seen your face, man. Come on, man. Some of my friends stopped by. We're having a little impromptu soiree. Why don't you meet my buddies? Come on, man, 'cause you didn't feed the ferrets? Hey, but feed the ferrets, dude. Hey, buddy, did you feed the ferrets today? Tim, man, these are my buddies. Shotgun, Connor, Spence and Pete is around here somewhere. - How you doin' today? - That's Pete right there. This is Lisa. Here you go. I'm alright. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go get some vodka. - Oh, that's good idea. - You guys need anything? You need some money, man? No, I'm good. What'd I tell ya? My roommate's a giver, not a taker. - Hey, dad. - You all right? - Yes, sir. - Jason Mitchell Street. Your father has been up all night trying to call you. - We had no idea where you were. - Yeah, she's right. - This is not fair to your mother. - You guys are right. To neither of us. You understand that? It's unfair for you to stay up and wonder where I am. I'm sorry. It can't happen again and it won't happen again, okay? I'm movin' in with Herc. - You just gonna wear this? - Yeah. Hey, girls. Can I talk to Jules for a second? I'm just gonna put her necklace on. - You know, I can do it. I'll do it. - I think I can get it. That's all right. Honey, I can do it. - She looks beautiful. - I know. I was thinkin' about you were right about something. About what? I do want a great family picture today. I think that's why this whole christening has been so important to me, is because, you know, I want our family back. I want you back. And now we have Gracie, and Gracie's part of it. And today's about bringing her into that. But you being the godmother, it's 'cause, you know, when she was born, I thought to myself this is the luckiest girl in the world, cause she has Julie as her older sister. You are the most special person in the world and so, today, for me, why it's been such a big deal... is 'cause today I'm gonna be able to celebrate my two amazing daughters. I love you, honey. I'm sorry for earlier. It's okay. - Who has the baby, y'all? - I have the baby. - Okay, good. - Did you take the quiches off? Oh, gosh. Oh, good. Julie did it. Thank you. I got it. They need to be brown on top. - They're kinda like green - Hey, hon. Honey, come here. Come here. - Honey. - What? Well, I think Tim Riggins is parked out in front of our house. It looks like he's asleep. - What are you talking about? - I don't know what it's all about. Do you think I should put these out now, or should I wait until we're back? Will you take this, son? You got that? I've been looking for, maybe, do something with it. Right there. Smash those peanuts. That's good. Not for eating. It's for puttinng it in. Christening is our acknowledgment that this little one is included in God's unconditional love. Today, Gracie Belle reminds us of God's unconditional love for all of us. Love, and forgiveness, and new life given by our Lord. We welcome the newest member of our church family, the newest member of God's family.
