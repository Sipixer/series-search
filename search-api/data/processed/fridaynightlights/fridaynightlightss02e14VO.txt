to play football for us at TMU. Hey, y'all, the Smash is going for the U, baby! Leave my sister alone. You got one of ours, why shouldn't we get one of yours? They've decided to suspend you - for three games. - That's the rest of the regular season. - Where you going? - Guatemala. I love you, and you love me. I know that. I don't understand why you'd be leaving. It doesn't make any sense. She had to leave a day early. She really wanted to tell you good-bye. Don't burn my sausages. You know I like those Jimmy Deans tender. I'm not making sausages, grandma. I'm making eggs. I want french toast. Carlotta says tuesdays - are french toast tuesdays. - Carlotta's not here, so we're not gonna be having... Oh, my lord! You cut my toast in those little triangles I like. - Yep. Just for you. - That looks so good, boy. Here you go. You just wait till she comes back, though. She's not gonna come back, grandma. Well... - We'll see. - Yep. We will. You do a good job. Thank you. Why did she leave? I don't know. Well... We are just fine. - I love you. - I love you too. Have a good day. Be good. I'll try. At what time are your hands on the wheel? 10:00 and 2:00. Don't roll your eyes at me. You're gonna need them for the road. And when you disrespect the vehicle, accidents happen, understood? So when I start driving, can you not be in my car? What's the speed limit in a residential area? It depends on how many people I hit. Really funny. You know what else's funny? You waving from a little window of a big yellow bus. - You've seen my volleyball shoes? - Where you left 'em, honey. Thank you, sweetie. 30 miles an hour in a residential area unless otherwise marked. And what's this state's legal alcohol limit? .08, dad. For those over 21. But for you it's zero. I catch any alcohol and you together in a vehicle, and I promise you will never drive again. Honey, I think you need to back off her. I'm gonna take her for her test. Fine. You wanna fire me? Good. I'll be in the bathroom. - TMI, dad. - Maybe my shoes are in the car. Call it D-day in Dillon. The news is out. The district board has suspended Smash Williams</i> for the remainder of the season. The board will not comment on their decision.</i> With Smash suspended, it's hard to envision</i> how these Panthers can make it through the next three games</i> to make the playoffs. In the history of Texas high school football,</i> no team has won State and not made the playoffs the following year.</i> But it looks like that is a real possibility</i> for these Panthers. The season has been a real roller coaster.</i> You have to wonder... 2x14: LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND Transcript: www.swsub.com Subtitles: DarKsh, GillesSilb, Sixe This blows. Can't get it done without Smash. We might as well kiss playoffs good-bye. You know what's gonna help get us to State? - To keep whining like that. - Oh, you gonna get us there solo? Nice play, man. Thanks. You know what? I did what I did. I don't have to explain myself... - Shut up! It's done. - That's what I'm sayin'. You shut up too. You don't have to talk always. Sit down. Take your seat. Riggs, get a seat. Listen up, guys. Smash is suspended for three games. This... is about more than just football, gentlemen. It's about adversity and how we stand up to it. No one said they were gonna hand us the playoffs. What we are gonna do is we're gonna work, we're gonna adjust, and we're gonna work some more. We're gonna take adversity, turn it into an asset, and we're gonna ride that asset all the way to the damn playoffs. That's gonna start with the team captains. What the hell happened to you? You look like hell, son. Here we go. Coach Crowley, you wanna take us through it? This is their red zone offense, their motions and trips. Let's talk about these still lifes. Why don't you start? You can talk about your own drawing or you can critique someone else's. They're okay. Can you elaborate on that? Talk about the composition, value, accuracy. They're all okay. Art is more than just drawing. We need to analyze the work, talk about why a drawing is successful or not. Do you think you succeeded? In drawing a vase of flowers? Yes, I think I did. Okay, why? Because I can tell that it's a vase, and I can tell that there's flowers in it. I'd like you to work a little harder at your critique in the future. Bitch. Excuse me? What did you say? My critique is that we're drawing a bunch of sad, stupid pictures of sad and stupid flowers. And I said bitch. Where you going? Matt, we have spanish class in diez minutos. Screw it. Do you at least want me to tell 'em that you got sick? I don't care. Jean. Right. You and Landry do that physics thing together, right? Right. - I don't want this to be weird. - You don't want what to be weird? Are you a friend, or are you competion? Competition? Oh, my God. Are you talking about Landry? 'Cause I like him. I think he's great, and I'm not blind to see the way he looks at you. I just wanted to make sure nothing's happening there. We're just friends. Great. 'cause I'm telling you I like him. Good. For you. That's great. Go for it. He's a great guy. I gotta get to practice. See you later. Hang 'em. One thousand. One... One thousand. Two... One thousand. - Where the hell's Saracen? - I don't see him. - Well, get him down here. - All right. - How's Lance's knee? - He's out for a while. - How'd he do that? - He tripped over a curb. Tripped over a curb. - Take over. - Yes, sir Coach, I know I'm suspended, but I really want to be out here. I appreciate you suitin' up. You're a good captain. You are a good team leader. Right now, I need to work this team out here today, without you. You understand what I'm saying? - I'm gonna go do weights. - That a boy. Let's go. Stretch 'em out good. Saracen's not here. I know he's not here. Where the hell is he? Landry said he's home and he's sick. Landry, Saracen, Smash. All right, listen up! Here's what we're gonna do. First string, I want Brooks and Westin in for Smash and Saracen. Coaches, get 'em together. Let's go. We got a lotta work to do. Good lord, what are you talking about, Brooks for Smash? Brooks for Smash. All right. All right. - Let's go, gentlemen. - G.C, get 'em together! - What are you doing? - I have a surprise for you. - What? - I found the mother lode. Mystery science theater 3000 short forms on youtube. - There's at least, like 50 of 'em. - Are you serious? - Excited? - Don't mess with me, that wouldn't - be funny. - I wouldn't lie to you. That pretty much takes care of the entire weekend. At least, let's try to stretch this out. We have to watch them in order, like alphabetical order - or some other crazy kind of order. - We'll come up with something. We'll figure it out. - It'll be fun. - I'm gonna have to prop my leg up. It really takes a good technique to... sit on the bench. You think you could possibly bring some ice? The doctor said I'm supposed to ice it. 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off. That sounds like a great weekend. I hope I'm invited. You know, I keep telling her to run a back slide, and every single time, she's gonna set it up high and outside... Every single time without fail. You didn't hear this from me, but Catherine's not gonna set to Megan anymore, 'cause Megan started seeing her ex, Jimbo. - Good grief. - I know. - Dinner was really good. - Thank you, sweetie. Those mashed potatoes were unbelievable. The butter. I know, I know. Mrs. T., can if I ask you a question? Is it insane if I feel a little jealous that some girl likes Landry Clarke? Lance Landry clarke? I don't know. I mean, do you like Landry Clarke? No, it's nothing like that. It's just that this girl Jean, she asked my permission to start seeing him and... I said yes. Not that she needs my permission or anything. It's affecting me so much, I feel like I'm going crazy. I had a boy like that in high school, Scott Hunter. And he was real nerdy, you know... - She doesn't need to... - She asked. I thought he was so sweet. He had the biggest crush on me, and it felt good, and I liked that. So I let it go on a little while, but finally I realized: It's not fair. The fair thing to do, the kind thing to do is to let him go. Good guys always finish last. That's what she's trying to say. It's not, 'cause look at you. You finished first, didn't you? - I don't know about that! - Well, I do. Look deep in your soul. Tyra, do you wanna go do our precalc? We can finish it up. You know what? I actually have to get going. But I'll see you at school tomorrow? - Thank you for dinner. It was amazing. - Of course, honey, and let me tell you. You are doing a great job. I'm so proud of you. - See you tomorrow at practice. - Thanks, Mrs. T. - Keep it up! Bye. - Bye, guys. - Bye, hon. Get home safely. - Bye, coach. Okay. Honey, we should go on vacation, just the two of us. You know what I mean? Now that Gracie girl's getting a little older. We could leave her with my sister. Honey, haven't we been planning that same vacation for 16 years now? I'm just sayin'. You gonna come to my volleyball game? I wouldn't miss it for anything in the world. I have to say, I'm having such a good time with this coaching. I mean, it's so satisfying. Because it's nice to have some teenage girls listen to me for a change. That's probably what it is. You realize that Julie's a bit envious, don't you? What, you mean of the volleyball thing? Julie hates volleyball, sweetie. I understand, but you gotta understand how sensitive she is too. Sweetheart, who knows how sensitive our dear daughter is more than me? You're barking up the wrong tree. I may be barking up the wrong tree. I just thought I'd say something. - Envious? - I just wanted you to keep it in mind. If you're thinking about grabbing the world by the berries and lighting your own fire, that's what you need. - No, it's cool, I... - Sit on it. - It's a little out of my price range. - That's the old you talking. Get on it. Give it a burn. If you feed that baby right, you'll never get off. - I know. This... - Looks good. I'm gonna go get the key. I'll be right back. Take your time. QB one... Skippin' school again. Yeah, well, yesterday's kinda turned into today, so... - What about you? - I always skip wednesdays. Seriously, what's the deal with the bike, though? Nothin'. - What are you gonna do? - I was thinkin', hit the museum, yoga, library for a bit. Then again, I might just do the "ushz." Wanna go for a beer? How did you know that we weren't gonna get carded here? Charlie? He'll never card me. I mean, he's old school. So coach was pretty rattled at you yesterday, not showin' up. - Gonna show up today or what? - No. No, I'm not. I'm not done being dumped. You know what was good about the way I got dumped though? Carlotta, she just dumped me. She just left a note on the pillow and left the country. Over. Like the breakup fairy. - You want a funnel or... You know? - No, I just... I wanna be more like you. It doesn't matter. Smash is off the team. The season's done. You're fine, that's fine. You can get any girl you want. You get all the girls, whatever. And nothing matters. You're just always... the same. Even-keeled. That's what I wanna be able to do. I wanna be able to be even-keeled. Always. Look at these two bible thumpers. They come here every day for lunch. Isn't that sad? It's sad if you ask me. Stalkin's sad if you ask me. All right. Stay here. I'll be right back. Burger... What's going on? How you guys doing? - Can I help you? - Tim Riggins. It is a pleasure. It really is. You have great hair. The other night, you were brilliant. That sermon you did... - Tim, please. - I appreciate that. I'm glad you were there. You should come back. - Anytime. - Might just have to. - You look great. - She does. - You both look great. Together. - Thank you. We got a pitcher if you guys are interested. Shalom. See ya, Garrity. - Let's go. - Where we going? - We're going to practice. - No, I can't go. You can. Chug some water. Corn nuts for the breath. Let's go. - Eat it! - Okay. Careful now. Watch both ways very clearly around that corner. You know what I been wanting to ask you, hon? You don't wanna play on the volleyball team - or anything, do you? - What? No, I don't. Careful, he's pulling out right there. You gotta... Eyes all around. I just wanted to check in with you about that, about the volleyball. - Have you seen their uniforms? - Well, yes, I have. Volleyball's just not my thing, you know? You're not gonna make me play or something, are you? Oh. No! Of course I'm not gonna make you play. Of course I wouldn't do that. I... There's a red light. There's a red light. Watch... Ease into your stop. Ease into your... Well, okay, all right. We're gonna practice that. We'll practice that. All right! - Come on, let's go out there! - All right, we're goin'. When I run, you know, want me to run, I'll run. Ready? You get me? Stop smiling. Serious game. You get it? All right! Set! Blue... Whoa, man! I'm not your sitter. Come on! - Let's go! - We're good. We're good. On your marks! Get set! Overhaul! Do the overhaul! Red... The red thing. You're good... Line up, red. The red, you got that? You got it? All right! Green 20! Green 20! Hut! Get your ass over here right now! That's a good effort. Good effort. What's going on? What the hell are you doing? What the hell are you smiling at? Nothin'. It's been a really bad day, so I was trying to have some fun out there. You get your ass out there, and you get it together right now. Yes, sir. You smell that? No, I don't. Jean's just such a cool girl. You know, she really appreciates all different types of films. She's really like a film scholar. I need to decide which movie is gonna be more conducive to romance. Is it gonna be Wrath of Khan or is it gonna be Jaws? - Does it really matter? - It does matter. Because this is kinda big for me. This is gonna decide whether or not Jean Binnel's gonna pass through those velvet ropes to becoming my girl, you know? - You look like you're gonna throw up. - I'm okay. Are you gonna eat that? You're very dehydrated. Which happens whenever you get drunk. - That's why I'm drinking. - It's called a side-effect. Buddy, Landry. What's going on? What's goin' on is we're gonna be the first team in Texas football history to win the state championship and not make the playoffs next year, courtesy of one Brian "Smash" Williams. - Good to have you here. - He's hung over, in case you were wondering. Matty, I'm not happy about this. I'm just trying to keep my head down and move through it. It's on you and the team to get to the playoffs so I can get back on the field. You know what he did? This guy also ditched school with Tim Riggins. I don't even know who you are anymore. - That's your new role model? - No, it's... I just don't wanna see you become at-risk youth. Why don't you discuss what's going on in Matt Saracen's life? I'm trying to reach out to you, and you're just walking away from me just like that. Keep walkin', Matt. Walk away. Oh, my God. Stop talking. Walk away. What do you think? You think The Wrath of Khan or Jaws for like a date? What? Jaws? Let's go y'all. You can do it. Work together now! Come on now, y'all. Call the ball! Beautiful, ya'll. Let's finish it. Watch their center. Close the block. Let's do now, y'all. You can do it. Teamwork! Let's go! That was a victory. I knew y'all could do it! I'm so proud of you! - One, two, three! - Panthers! Let's go to my house! All right, who wants a hot fudge sundae? Mrs T? You had a mullet. That was a good look. You didn't like the perm? Mom, I like you in a perm. I like the way that looks. And you like to dance, don't you? Thanks. What? Excuse me. What's goin' on? Is this what your dad was talking about? - I have no idea. - He said that you were feeling a little sensitive about me coaching volleyball. Volleyball. It does seem to me that you have not been a big fan of this volleyball situation, and I know it must be eating up some time that we have together. But we are gonna have to learn to deal with the situation without you comin' in and slamming around. Sorry. Maybe I'm being rude. I just believe in mom when she says I'll see you at the DMV. Oh, hon... I waited there an hour. I tried calling your cell phone. I tried calling the house. You're right. I should just work on my jealousy issues. Sweetie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - We're closed, ma'am. - You work here? Let me ask you something. You're not supposed to close for another ten minutes. I shut everything down. My last appointment left... My daughter missed her appointment today - because of me. - She can come back tomorrow. Let me just tell you, this is my fault... And I just... It's just important. I can understand that. If I don't redeem myself, I may not get her to trust me again for a while, and that's just gonna be a problem. Do you have kids? There are ten minutes... All right, she can take the road test today. - That is so kind. - But I can't do any of the paperwork - until tomorrow. - Great. - Are you a Panther's fan? - No. I hate football. Okay. Come here, sweetie. Here you go. Alright. Go get 'em. You know what you're doing. That's my daughter Julie. - Thanks. - We're gonna make a right over here. Good. Just take it easy. There she goes, Gracie Bell. Taking her driver's test. Can't believe it. Oh, my God. Honey, can you come over here? I gotta ask you a serious question. You see these things on me? They're like whiskers. You see them? Just pay to get a wax, it's easier. Oh, my God. Mama, did you ever... compete with a girl over a guy? Oh, honey, well, the question is really, did I ever not compete with a girl over a guy? - Come on, seriously. - I am serious. I- I like the chase. I like the challenge, poor girls. Did you like the guy? I like to win. Okay, see, that's just sick. I know but I'll tell you something. This whole family, that kinda competion, it runs in your blood. I just think it's stupid to compete over something like that. Well, you're right. It is stupid. But you're so much more evolved than your poor mother, thank God. Would you like a diet coke, my daughter? That's okay. Two more lemon drops! You like those, right? You're not gonna puke yet, are ya? I don't know why we never do this before. - Me neither. - I don't either. 'Cause it's good times. You know what? Keep drinkin', I got a surprise for ya. You gettin' another round? - You see... the rookie right there? - Yeah. Hey, Chastity! My treat, my treat. Take it easy on him. He's still in high school. He's a cutie pie! Yeah, you like him? Why are those guys gettin' all the action? 'Cause they're younger and don't need viagra! Don't touch me. I'm almost done with high school. - Really? - Yes. Here, drink up! - Drink up! - Oh, shoot. That's great. Oh, shoot, I'm vibrating, girl. You're making me buzz! You're making me... - Where you goin'? - I'm gonna be back. You'll hurt her feelings, Mattie! 7! You talk to Crowley about the basic defense? I did. 4-3. Yeah? I need to talk to you, coach. - I'll, uh... I'll see you in a few. - All right. Brian? TMU. They're revoking my scholarship. It's off the board's decision. They say I've got... questionable character. That's the mark of death, coach. That's my future. No! Her name is Lorraine... Saracen. Yes, your hospital left me many voice mails, about Lorraine Saracen... I'm her g-grandson. Yes! I'm on my way. I guess she... She hit her head getting out of bed. Well, I am just so sorry, pulling you away from your customers. But I do thank you... so much. No, no, no. Don't worry about it, Matt, it's cool. Actually, I suffer from an illness which is called selachophobia... Which is the fear of sharks. And I would appreciate it if you would, instead of ridiculing me, maybe support me a little bit. Right, so don't be like... One summer... - 1,100 boys in the water... - That's not funny! Hey, Jean. Hi. Hey, Tyra. - How are you doing? - Good. Did you... Did you see <i>Jaws</i> too? Yeah. Great, great movie. Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. - Yeah. - Yeah. That okay? - Yeah. Everything okay? Yeah. This is hard to say, so I'm just gonna say it. Look... I like you. You were right, okay? I do like you. I wanna give us a shot. That's what you came here to say, was... Yeah. I mean, I'm on... I'm on a date right now... Tyra, and she's not... She's not embarrassed of me or to be seen with me. She actually likes me. Last time I checked, you were somewhere in-between. That's not fair, Landry. - You was... - That's not fair! We both know how we got together, and it wasn't exactly under normal circumstances. It was messed up and scary, and, yeah, I was... I was confused. But I'm not now. Well... I'm on a date. Look, I'm sorry. - I don't know what else to say. - No, no, I... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You... you have a great night. I'll... I'll see you around. - Ready to get outta here? - Yeah. Let's go. Brian? Baby? What you doing? You been in here all night. This is all my TMU stuff. The pamphlets, the posters, the gear... I'm gettin' rid of it, 'cause it's over, mama. It's over. You wanna tell me I told ya so? No. I just wanna let you know I love you. Oh, I love you. And I believe in you. I believe in you. Coach. Sorry for calling you. No, I appreciate it. What's going on? We didn't know what else to do. I understand. All right. Hey, Ms. Saracen. Coach Taylor! - How you doing? - How are you doing? I'm feeling much better now that I know you're all right. It's so good to see you. How's your wife and Gracie? They're doing just fine. I'm here to... I'm here to take y'all home, if that's all right. Well, yes it is. I'm ready to go home. Gimme a hand here real quick. Why don't we... walk with this gentlemen? I'll be right with you. - I'm Lorraine. - Nice to meet you. What the hell are you thinkin'? I wasn't. You know you smell like a damn drunk right now, don't you? Yeah. I do. Thank you. Come on, Ms. Saracen. - Bye-bye. You keep up the good work. - Thank you again. - Thank you so much. - Yes, ma'am. - Here's your water. - Sure you don't want me - to fix you a sandwich? - No, I don't need a sandwich. No, I've already eaten. Thank you very much. - We got a game tomorrow night. - Yes, ma'am. Sure glad you came by, 'cause I think Matthew needs your help. Okay. - All righty. - Good night. - Thank you again. - You're welcome. I don't need any of your dad coach talk, so you... feel free to just go home. Don't touch... Get away from me! Get off me! Do you know how many people depend on you to make good decisions? Do you have any idea? Your grandmother, your teammates! You better start making 'em! You better stop being so damn selfish and stop feeling sorry for yourself! Shut up! You don't care about me! You left me for a better job! Your daughter left me for a better guy! Carlotta left me for Guatemala. My dad left me for a damn war! Everybody leaves me! What's wrong with me? There's nothing wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with you at all. Shouldn't you be getting ready for a football game right now?</i> I'll head over in just a minute. That's... that's a pretty snazzy sweater you have on there. You come all the way over here to tell me that? I don't know how to say this, but... Then don't. Will you please just try and listen to me? Landry, Landry, I don't wanna listen. Please don't do this. All right... This isn't fair to you for me to just ignore this and pretend like it's not there. I can't just keep doing that to you, okay? You're making a mistake. I actually gotta go. There's kind of a spot with my name on the bench. I can't Miss that, so... Then I'll see you after the game. Come on back. Okay, good, now... No, you're cutting too soon. Honey, honey... Honey! Stop! Stop! Honey, hold on, hold on! Don't cut it yet! Wait. I got it, okay? I only missed two on my driving test. Hey. How are y'all? Hey, y'all. Just came by to wish my team luck. Saracen... I wanted to stop by and tell ya to kick some ass tonight. All you boys gotta do it tonight. This might end up being the last place I ever play. Smash. Coach, I don't care what the board says or if we forfeit the rest of the season. Smash is a part of this team. - That's right, coach. - Let him play. He can't play, and y'all are very well aware of that. Look, look, I know I can't play... all right? The best thing you can do for me is win. Get to the playoffs. I'll be right back with y'all doin' my thing. For now, I'll be watching. But y'all could still do this. I mean, look, you got Saracen, Riggins, Bradley can barely catch a cold, much less a football. Brooks probably the slowest brother in Texas. But, look, everybody plays hard. And no matter what happens out there, y'all rember this. You the Dillon Panthers, baby. - That's right.
