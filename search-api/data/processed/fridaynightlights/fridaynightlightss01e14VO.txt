He doesn't buy into the whole jock thing. People change. Especially when they're on the team. Look, it's just some pick-me-ups I've been taking. What are you doing to my son? I don't know what's going on here. This! Smash is not gonna be playing the game Friday night. What? Am I off the team? I should have reported this. You're gonna get yourself clean. Dad's down in Corpus Christi. He's working on a driving range. Couple of postcards every year and he gets off scot-free! I'm the one paying the bills around here, going out there and watching your damn football games. What's this? You've been served. Served by who? Jason Street's family. It's killing me to have to do this to coach. The lawyers, my parents, maybe they're right. Maybe if somebody teaches me how to tackle somebody, I'm not in a chair. Why'd you set Lyla up on a date with Ty Johnston? I don't want Lyla to be a caregiver her whole life, son. These Buddy Garritys of this world, they're a cancer to you and me. Lyla Garrity... will you marry me? So there's two cones on either side of the goal. There's two goals, one on either side of the court. You play on a basketball court. And the goal is to get this ball-- Y'all, watch those windows. And you wheel yourself through the finish-- That's okay. You wheel yourself through the goal line and that's how you score. The position I really wanted - is called the "picker." - It's like the quarterback, right? Right, right. He kinda controls the flow of the game and he leads the breaks and everything. You gotta be really fast. It's a really, really hard position but I think-- I think I'm good enough for it. So is this what I see them playing at the YMCA sometimes? Oh, no, ma'am, that's wheelchair basketball. Oh.There's a huge difference. Oh, yeah. Huge. Well, there is a big difference, Mr. Garrity. The guys who play quad rugby, they're world-class athletes. Three of them won medals last year at the world championship. - Did they? - Yeah. I know, it's great. It's a great hobby. Come on, Dad, it's not a hobby. You can't make a living from it, honey, so it must be a hobby. You guys, let's come on in and eat, all right? You know what, Mr. Garrity? What exactly do you have against quad rugby again? Nothing. Yes, you do 'cause every time I come over here, - you're always making fun of it. -Sweetie. All  I'm saying is it's not a way to make a living. So what are you gonna live off of, huh? - Lawsuit? - Buddy, enough, okay? Oh, is that what this is about, Mr. Garrity? You still pissed off about the lawsuits? - Yes, I am. - What, are you a little kid? Get over it! Hey, let me tell you something, son. You're suing my team. You're suing my coach. - How do you expect me to feel? - It's your team? How about a little compassion, Mr. Garrity? I mean, I am paralyzed now. - Jason. - All right, play the game. - Ply the gasme. - I don't care. Play the game. I will play the game, Mr. Garrity. - I will, I will. - Do it. And when I make the national team and I start touring all over the world, I'll take your daughter with me. How 'bout that? 'Cause we're getting married. Excuse me? - That's right. - Married? Yeah, we picked out a ring this morning, didn't we? Okay. Daddy, please. What are you doing? What am I doing? He's pushing me. - Jason. - Hey. I'm not doing anything wrong here, Lyla! Lyla! Friday Night Lights 1x14 Upping the Ante Transcript: Raceman Synch: Tauri41 ..:: www.forom.com ::.. Good evening, football fans! I'm Ralph Jarrett, broadcasting live from Applebee's in Reiner Junction for a special playoff edition of Talkin' Panther Football. You know, the brackets have been set and we know Dillon has drawn the McNulty Mavericks in the first round. I'm going all the way with him, baby. The big question all over town is Smash Williams who got benched last week and didn't play. Is he gonna be able to play this Friday night? Let's get to the phone lines! So who had the quesadilla burger? I did. Anyways, he got exactly what he deserved. Shut up, man. I mean, do you even know what happened? Are you a big shot now? Want to take us to state by yourself? The point is, we won last week without him. How did your meeting with Mr. Connolly go? Um, it actually went really good. - Yeah? - Um, well, I mean, what I really want is I want my own column, you know, where I could do reviews on movies and books and concerts. - That'd be cool. - Julie Taylor's column on life. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a big treat. I understand starting quarterback Matt Saracen is in the house. Maybe he'll come up and join us. Come on, Matt! Sar-a-cen! Sar-a-cen! You  really didn't have to do this. - I could stay right here. - No, go, go. Sar-a-cen! Sar-a-cen! And then straight from the radio, Matt Saracen here. Matt's sitting down here talking about football. I, uh-- Look, I'm so sorry. I didn't think-- I mean, that guy can talk. Seriously. He doesn't stop talking. No, it's cool. You're the big star now, right? No, I'm not a big star. I didn't know that-- I'm sorry. I thought it would just be, like, hi, and then I came back, and you were-- Matt, they wouldn't even let me pay for dinner. Tonight is your night, my friend! Saracen. You're coming with. No, I'm not. - Let's go! - I'm with Julie right now. - Uh, no no no no-- - Seriously. Get in. - Wait, where are you taking him? - Duty calls! Keep him in there. - Uh-- - I'm-I'm sorry, but-- You can't just leave me here. Sorry, it's a football thing. - Yeah, but I need a ride home. - Let's go! They're making me do this. I don't wanna-- Let's go! - Whoo! - Football. You know, he's not coming back, if that's what you're thinking. Want a ride? Uh, no thank you. Um, I'll just call my mom. Okay. Wait! Are you sure you don't mind? Yeah. It's no problem. I just gotta pick my sister up first. Okay, well, where's she at? Working. Strip club. Two ways to fold a towel: my way and the wrong way. Let's do it right. Yes, sir. Game plan for Friday. I want ten of 'em. Binders and notebooks over by the copier. Right now? Well, gee, yeah, Smash, if it wouldn't be too much of an inconvenience, I'd appreciate it. Hey, let me tell you something. You think I'd rather be here right now with you at the crack of dawn than be home with my family cooking breakfast? - Coach, I'm sorry. - Huh? - I'm sorry. - You thinkin' about that? Did you bring those test results from the clinic? - Yes, sir. - Lemme see 'em. -  Coach, I didn't mean-- - You didn't mean what? You didn't mean to risk my reputation and my career? Is that what you were gonna say? I got the chairman of the district executive committee. You know what he's doing? He's calling me at home. So you're not the only one with your ass on the line, Smash. Yes, sir. That's good! Congratulations. Sir, I still don't see what the big deal is. Why can't I just pay the ticket and go? Well, the problem's not so much the speeding ticket. It's your failure to appear. Yes, sir. You see, I had an away game that day, so I completely forgot-- Look, how about this: you pay the fine, you promise me you're not gonna speed out there, and I'll drop the charges. If it's okay with your folks. Is it okay if my brother signs for me? Is he your legal guardian? - Billy! - What? Are you his legal guardian? Uh, no, technically I'm not, but-- Look, you're a minor. It has to be a parent or a legal guardian. Otherwise, I have to take your license. This is no joke, son. Just get that signed. All right, Your Honor. Um, I'll just get my father to sign it. Just get it signed and bring it back. So last night was the first time I've ever stepped foot in a strip club. You don't say. I know we were there for, like, five minutes, but does your sister ever get, like, freaked out? I mean, some of those guys were completely creepy. Yeah, well, she's a big girl. Plus, those guys are pretty harmless. Sad and pathetic, but harmless. Guess who her biggest customer is? Who? Buddy Garrity. Gross! Okay. No, it's up there. That color looks good on you. You  should get it. I don't know. I don't really have the money for it. What are you doing? Tim, just let me sign the stupid paper, man. No, Billy. I can't risk it. It's my license. What is this? Some sort of work out my stuff with dad thing? What are you talking about? Hey, Tim. We haven't even seen the guy in two years, man. We don't even know if he still lives here. I'm sure it'll be fine, Billy. All right, I'm good. Hey. Come here. Do not believe a word that that man says, okay? Because he is a total liar. And do not get drunk with him because he is a mean son of a bitch when he's loaded. Billy, it's a signature. That's all I'm gettin'. All right.All right. You got money? Yeah, I got money. Here. Uh, take that. Whatever you do, do not, under any circumstances, give that money to him. I understand, Billy. All right. All right. Thank you. Hey! See ya soon! Yeah. No, you are not going to a concert on a weeknight. But it's not just any concert. I mean, it's the Old 97s and they're awesome. Well, if they're so awesome, why don't they get a gig on a weekend? What do I have to do to make this work? I will get on the floor and start groveling. Honey, what about your homework? I'll get it done... before I leave and you can check it and I'll stay in on Saturday. And you and me and dad, we can have, like, a family night. Oh, honey, don't grovel. It's not becoming. Please? All right. You have to be in by 11:00, not one second later. Yes, ma'am. And don't tell your father. Let me break it to your father. All you! Hey, where's your coat? Put your coat on! Hurry up. And make sure the door locks when you close it! Hurry up! Throwed his sorry ass out six months ago, Sugar. Well, do you know where I can find him, ma'am? Well, he used to hustle golf down at Jackson Crest. It's a little piece of crap muni somewhere out in the boonies. All right. I'll try him there. - Thank you. - You bet. Hey, if you see him, I want you to do something for me. I want you to tell him that I want my Conway Twitty back. They don't have him at Target no more. All right! Knock her close, buddy. No, knock her close. Nice shot, that'll save you a couple bucks. Oh, well. It's just money, right? The bill is 60. Thanks, gentlemen. Enjoy your money. Oh, I will. Hit that driving range. Good God in heaven. Timmy? Well come on! Give your old man a hug! Come here, boy. I guess I'm in no position to be offering up any fatherly advice. You know, given-- given the circumstances. You just want me to sign right here? Yeah. Thanks. All right. Thanks. So how you doing? - I'm fine. - Yeah? -  Really? - Yeah. How about you? Well, I'm good. Real good. Yeah, I'm on--I'm on the wagon now. You know, I've been sober, uh, six weeks next Tuesday. Nice. Otherwise, I'd be buying you a beer. Well, that's all right. I gotta drive anyways, so-- Oh. Well-- Yeah. - Anyways, I sh-- - Can you hang out for a while? Yeah. Yeah, I could-- I could stay for a bit. Well, I got $200 burning a hole in my pocket from Manny, Moe, and Jack out there. Are you hungry at all? I could eat. Good. Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want it to happen like that. - I really didn't. - It's okay. I swear. I know. It's kinda my fault too. I don't know why I felt like I had to hide it from them. I know you're gonna think this is a total girl thing, and I'm crazy, but--- but I just-- I've always had this vision, you know, of my wedding, and I'd be 25. There'd be this huge reception and dancing and toasts. You don't know if you can do all that with me now. No, Jason. If you're gonna be honest, just-- No, that has nothing to do with it being you. It's just I haven't even applied to a college yet. And you haven't even said whether or not you're-- Oh, you think I'm not going to college now? I don't know. I mean, I assume you are, but all you talk about is-- Lyla, I lost my legs, not my brain. Okay, I'm gonna go to school. And I'm gonna get a job. And we'll have friends. We'll have a big house and a picket fence and a couple of puppies and that whole thing you dream about. No, Jason! Getting married's not gonna change that. I have a life too. - I know. - No, sometimes I don't think you care about that anymore. Or you think it's lame. And it scares me, Jason. - No, that's not it at all. - I just think that we're too young right now and we're rushing into this. And I don't want to make a mistake. Message received, Lyla. Loud and clear. Can you please get my chair for me? Yeah. Blue, 20, hut! You gotta get up on him, Smash! Get out of the sack! Come on, Smash! Pick it up! What the hell are you walking for? God. Dang. - Coach-- - Let's go. Not as much fun when you're blocking, is it, huh? Just doing my job, man. Just doing my job. Smash, you better get your head out front! - You gotta drive his ass! - Yes, sir. Well, I can see teaching him a lesson, coach, but-- Let's go! It's not gonna do us much good Friday night if he's hurt. Who said he was gonna play Friday night? Let's go! Come on, Eric, you gotta be kidding me. Baxter can't hold Smash's jock. Let's go! - Hey, you're the coach. - Run the ball! It's your team. God, I'm tired of this! But you know tomorrow night will be good. That's gonna be a lot of fun. You know what, Buddy, I'm trying to win a play-off game here. I don't have time to talk about a damn TV show. It's tradition. It's simple. All you gotta do is go up there and smile pretty, talk about football for half an hour. It'll be easy. You'll love it. It's all about football. Let's go! Hustle up now! - Attaboy! - How's he gonna get outside-- And besides, remember, you get a nice little appearance fee for doing it. Wait a sec! Hold up, hold up! Look, I'm really sorry. I know you wanted to go to the concert Yeah, that's kinda the point, saying you invited me. - Right-- - But, you know, no biggie. I just pretty much sold my soul to my mother for permission. It's just, you know, your dad asked me, and well, I've never been on TV before. Okay, so if my dad wasn't involved, are you excited? Yeah, a little bit. Then you should go. - You rea-- - But! You have to remember this moment when I officially became the coolest and most understanding girl in the world. Okay, I will. I'll keep that in mind. Are you mad? A little, but I'll get over it. Good... because I also need you to watch my grandma while I do it? Please? Sure. Why not? See, you are the coolest, most understanding girlfriend in the world. Girlfriend? All right, girl. 'Cause I'm hoping-- - Please? - No. - Do not "no"-- - No! Yeah, baby, that's what I'm talking about! - Fish in a barrel! - Nice shot. Not too shabby. Hey, here she is. Hanna Banana. - Come here. - Oh, hey, Walt. This is my boy Tim. Take care of him. Whatever he wants. All right, I'll be back in a minute. - Okay. - Okay, thank you. Thank you. Oh, my God, so you're the son, huh? Nice to meet you. You know, he talks about you all the time. Really? Oh, yeah. Every Saturday when he comes in here for league, we get the whole update, who you played the score, how many touchdowns you made. Oh, he is so proud. And congratulations for making it to the playoffs by the way. - Check it out. - Check it out. - Oh, baby! - My God. A new ball. He's only waited on that for a month. This is a weapon. You're in serious trouble, my friend. Don't go hurting yourself. No, I won't. Thank you. Okay, honey. Bye, sweetie. I'll see ya later. I appreciate it. Hey, uh, if we're still gonna grab that bite to eat later, maybe it's best I stay at your place tonight. What do you think? Yeah, man! Bring it on. I got a couch with your name written all over it. All right. Hey! All right, this should be the screen pass to Riggins when we finally score here. - It's the play after this. - Hang on a second. No, Coach-- If you hit forward-- Hang on a second. I know what I'm doing. I smell Emmy. Yeah, well, I'm gonna have to renegotiate that appearance fee. - If you just hit it once-- - Stop! Hey, there's something wrong with the clicker. There's something wrong with the clicker! - We'll--we'll work-- - Ow. Okay... Let's not do the game film right now. Obviously we have a problem with the clicker. Let's do the interview. Uh, Coach, just relax, and have a conversation. What would you like us to have a conversation about? 'Bout football. Oh, that's great. Okay, let's do that. Anything specific? Matt, why don't you ask him, uh, some questions? Good? Yeah. That's a good idea. Okay. When you're ready. Well, okay, um... I think what everyone wants to know is, um, is Smash gonna play on Friday? What the hell kind of question is that? You're supposed to be helping me out here, Saracen. - Well, I just thought-- - Don't be goofy. Just ask a normal question. Let's get this over with That's what everybody's been asking. Ask him about the tight end. You find everything in there, honey? Uh, yeah. Everything's good. Uh, here's your sandwich. Mm. Thank you. Good. I got it. Is it okay? Um... I invited a friend over. I guess so. I like company all right. All right, that's the end of it, huh? That's all the other. That's all the other we got. I mean, that's one of the reasons I swore I'd never date a football player. Oh, honey, Matt's not really a football player. No offense. Oh, that's all right. All right, but now that he's acting like one here's what you gotta do. Number one rule in dating a Dillon Panther, always let him know you have options. But I do have options. I'm gonna join the school paper. I mean, like, the basketball team. They hate that. But I don't know anybody on the basketball team. Isn't that just kinda stupid? Okay, but see, he doesn't have to know that. I'm telling you, he's gonna have these rally girls fawning all over him until Spring, okay? You gotta elevate your game. Look, Eric, I have always loved Jason like my son. I still do. But this is my daughter we're talking about. And the bottom line is Jason's a quadriplegic. Now, I know it's not PC to say that, but I have to think about my daughter. She's my responsibility. I gotta think about her life. I'll tell you something. Jason Street's a good kid. He's gonna succeed no matter what he does. Just give him some time. The last thing you wanna do is pressure them. That's gonna come around and bite you in the ass - if you do that. - Yeah. - They're smart kids. They'll deal with it. - Yeah. I thought they were smart. I thought that till they tell me they're getting married. They're just in high school. I mean, maybe someday in the future if things work out. So please just talk to Jason. - I'll do that. - He respects you. - Thanks. - I'll do that. If someone would talk to his parents, maybe I wouldn't be getting sued right now. Yeah, I wish I could talk to them for you. Hey! That was a great job in there. - Thanks. - Yeah. Child, where you been? It's almost time for Leno! Boy! You been runnin' this whole time? Mostly. I stopped once or twice. Oh, I think you need to slow down. - Don't even worry about it. - Oh, I do worry about it. That's my job. That's your job? Well, I'm doing my job too, Mama. All right, I'm so tired I can barely finish my sets without feeling like I'ma fall over and die. I know. It's that poison. Your body just needs time to adjust. Mama, I don't have any time! You know what it's like over there? It's like blood in the water! I mean, I got Baxter trying to steal my job! And Coach watching me like a hawk! So, no, no! I'm not gonna slow down! At least not right now! I just worry about you. I know-- All Jason wanted to do was slalom. I bet I was in that boat with him for three hours trying to get him up. Going round and round. You remember? Yeah. I remember. He was pretty pissed that day. I don't think J's gonna be doing too much more skiing anymore though. It's a damn shame. He's good people, that kid. Yep. How's Billy doing? Good. He actually says to say hi. Did he really? No. Not at all really. You know, Billy's all right. I know he hates me. I don't blame him. You were too young, but he saw some things that... I'm not too proud of. Dad, I was ten. I wasn't blind. Hey, did you call your coach? Yeah, I did, and he's pretty rattled for missing two practices. Yeah. I reckon. It's worth it though. So what do you think of Parcells? Stick around for another year or what? Maybe get a ring. Friggin' Cowboys? No, no friggin' Cowboys. I'm gonna start rooting for the Saints. No kidding. Next on number one tee will be the Riggins twosome. Riggins. $5 Nassau. Automatic presses when you're down two. All right, well, that's not fair 'cause I got rentals. Which is why I'm giving you six strokes. Now don't be a whiner. Well, let's up the ante then. I win, you come to Dillon on Friday to watch me play. Deal? Uh-huh. What if I win? If you win, which you won't... I won't tell that gal Lydia where you live. That's a good one. It's pretty good. You're on. Let's see what you got. Long and wrong. Did you hit a car? Maybe. Nothing another swing can't take care of, you know. No, no, this ain't the LPGA, you weenie. There's no mulligans. Come on. All right. All right. Hut! Get there. Get there. Man, these guys are flat today. Where's our energy? All right, come on, let's hurry back! I'll tell you what the problem is... Come here! Somebody took the smash out of the Smash. Get over here. What the hell's wrong with you today? What? What the hell's wrong with you? Pro left 24 pitch. I hit the right gap. Yeah, you did fine. Congratulations. You know what though? Fine doesn't win playoff games. You're out here to win or you go home, understood? I was just doing what I'm told. You know what? Don't talk back to me. Talking back to me. - Think you're special? - I'm sorry. You can talk back to me now? Know what I what you to do? I want you to go down the end zone. You give me 20 suicides. Coach! - 20-- - 20 suicides! In the end zone right now, Brian! Let's go! Dank, I want some fire out here! Now let's do something! Somebody in there. We're gonna run the slants and nail on one. - Ready? - Break. - Set! - Sweetheart, not for nothing, but you are tied up in knots right now. You're wound up like a drum. Wound up? Yes, you are. And you know what? It's where Smash is gettin' it. You know? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Well, I think, you know, style filters down, babe. - "Style filters down"? - Yeah. What does that mean? It means, I know he made a mistake. I know it really pissed you off. It really pissed me off too. But you know what? He's a boy... He made a mistake. And he is trying so desperately to get back in your good graces. It seems to me you're so hard on him that he's losing his confidence. He's losing his passion. That's not gonna help you one bit on Friday night. Here, put those over there. I think you need to talk to him. I think you need to turn that around. Can you put these in the back pantry, please? There we go again. I'm actually getting kinda tired of hitting the green every time. Not bad. A little quick on your release though. Thanks, Mr. Nicklaus. I actually would take a swing tip from you if I wasn't kicking your ass right now. You're only two up. There's plenty of golf left to play. Yeah, yeah. Let me ask you something. You feeling the pressure right now? Uh, not really. I've seen you putt. Ready, set, go! Hey, mind if I sit down? Oh, no. Go ahead. Yeah! Yeah! We used to have a kid like that in the neighborhood when I was growing up. I was that kid. Yeah, I see the resemblance. Yeah! Yeah! The reason I've been so hard on you is-- 'Cause I let you down. Look, I appreciate you coming down here, Coach. But I don't need you to like me, okay? I've made peace with that. So I'ma just do what I need to do on my own. No, that's not what I want you to do. That's not what football's all about. You wanna fly solo, you go run track. Sometimes we take this so serious, we lose track of exactly why it is we love this damn game so much, why it is we play this game. I'm guilty of that. Hey. Hey, are you really Coach Taylor? I am. Well, you get ready for me. I'll be there the first day of practice in 2014. Running back. Remember the name, Coach, Miles Shepard. Miles Shepard. - Shepard. - Yup, that's my name. All right, I'll tell you what. You give me a call when you get out of pee-wee. I'll do that, sir. Nice. Smash, you wanna play? I need a challenge, dog. - Y'all wanna play some football? - Yeah! Let's go! - All right, let's do it. - Yeah! Old Smash wants to get his head handed to him. All right, who's on my team? Who's on my team? Come here, girls. Hut-hut-hut! Go, go, go, go! Bring her out, bring her out, bring her out. Come on, Coach! I'm gonna give you a flag. Yes! It's a ballgame right there, boy! Ah! That was a good effort, partner. You had me worried there for a minute. What? You thought I was gonna let you win? You know what, if you didn't wanna come to the game, you could have just said so. It would have been a lot easier. Listen to me, all right? This bit-- I mean-- Seeing you, you coming here, it's great hanging out with you. And you're welcome here any time, but me going to Dillon that's a whole different thing. Apparently. It is, son. It is. Billy was right. I shouldn't have come here in the first place. - It was a mistake. - Hang on, now. - You made the bet, - It was a mistake. and I beat you fair and square! Congratulations! Is that what you need right now? Hey, you be a man-- - Be a man. - Is that you win? - Come over here, and shake my hand. - You win! Hey! Timmy! You get back over here and shake my hand! Hey. So how was it? Got the signature. Dad says hi. I can't believe you spent the night. What the hell is that? What's going on? Did you order up some rally girls? I don't know, maybe. Hi, Tim. - How you doin', ladies? - It's time to go. I'll take some mental notes, Billy. Hey, Matt. Time to go! Help these girls with their fundraising. Why are you touching me? Bye! Bye. Oh, my God! Perfect. That's definitely Mr. October. Seriously, I don't know if I can do this. What don't you know? If Julie finds out about this-- Listen, you're gonna take a few pictures. It's for charity. Tell me straight up, are you whipped? Hey, y'all didn't tell me I need to bring my own wardrobe. Smash, hey! - Hey, what's up? - What's up, Smash? - How you doin', Matty? - Good. Hey, I didn't expect to see you here, man. I didn't know you had it in you, baby. Come on, Matt! You're gonna be my Mr. November. Come on, Matty, give me a little Hugh Hefner. Smash, help me out. Seriously, take it off! Let me do it with my shirt on. Wait, this is seriously-- Oh, oh! That's for charity! Come on, Matty, strike a pose! It's infuriating. - I'm furious. - I know. I mean, how could the Streets just listen to some lawyer who tells them that they need to sue us? Baby, you know what you're doing, don't you? I know, I know. I'm making it worse I know, I know I need to just calm down. I need to just be supportive. - I wanna go with you today. - No - Yes. - No. I can have my appointments just changed to tomorrow. You know what? There's gonna be--I need that. There are gonna be times when I need you over at the courthouse and times when I don't need you. Believe me, today I do not need you. It's only gonna be a hearing. If I did need you, I'd let you know. But I love you very much for suggesting it. I'm all good. But thank you. I know. How you doing? I'm doing fine, Coach. How you doing? Good. You know we're really not supposed to be talking too much right now. Screw the lawyers. It's not about the case. I heard about you and Lyla. I know what I want. I don't see why it's such a big deal. I'll tell you what, it's not a cure-all. It's the biggest damn commitment you're gonna be making in your life. Y'all are young. You better make sure. You better make damn sure. I am sure. I am sure. It's her that maybe is not so sure. It seems like she needs a little time to work some stuff out. No one's telling you you shouldn't get married. What they're saying is just take some time, feel it out. Who knows, though? You make your future father-in-law happy, you might be able to squeeze a damn big-ass party out of him. I don't-- I do not know about that, sir. You should have se how pissed off he was when I told him. - Was he? - You shoulda seen him, ]that big head of his. It was all red and... All right, Coach. Hey, Coach. I'm sorry they're making you do this on game day. It wasn't my choice. See y'all in there. Hey. Hey. I didn't see you in math. Um, did, uh... Did you finish the book? I did. What'd you do last night? Um, nothing, I just went to work. And then I went home. I saw the calendar. Wh-what? A bunch of the rally girls were passing it around this morning. No, see, they totally kidnapped me, like, like, with Riggins the other night. But nothing happened. So it's-- nothing happened at all. Why'd you lie about it? I don't know. That was dumb. My head's just all foggy for some reason. I can't imagine why. Julie, I'm sorry. Okay? You know what? I'm sorry too. - No, don't say that. - I'm sorry for trusting you. But I don't appreciate getting lied to. So why don't you go with your little rally girls and your football friends and just leave me alone. Pure basic stuff. I'm sorry. I was on the other side of campus. You wanted to see me, Coach? You're starting to tailback tonight. What the hell? You want a hug or something? Get out of here. Go ahead. Oh, Lord, God, we just ask that you be with us on the field tonight. God, we just ask that you just inspire us to greatness right now. God, we ask that you protect us, Oh, Lord. We ask that you make us proud in defeat and humble in victory. But either way, God, we just ask that you be with us. God, you know how much we been through this season. God, we know that this game is the key to our destiny, God. So we just ask that you give us courage right now. God, we just ask that you give us strength right now. We just ask that you bless each hand that we hold. Bless all the fans and everybody out there under those lights tonight, Amen. Amen! No tellin', baby. It's all you done, baby. Put it up! Put it up! I said clear hearts! Full hearts! Can't lose! Clear hearts! Full hearts! - Can't lose! - Clear Hearts! - Full hearts! - Can't lose! Come on, baby! Let's go! Tim! Hey, Tim! What are you doing? I need an extra ticket. Too bad, Billy. The game's about to start. - You know that.
