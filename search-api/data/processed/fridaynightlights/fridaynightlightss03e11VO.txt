- OK. That little bastard! The savings that we were keeping for your college is the money I used for the investment. I lost all the money and... Where are you going? - Don't! Don't touch me. - Please, don't leave me. I need to ask you a favor. I'm taking the SAT's on Saturday. I was kinda hoping, if you weren't doing anything, if maybe you could... - Help you out? - Yeah. - Landry's kinda cute up there. - Yeah, I know. - Hey, what about a sangria set? - Oh, that's great. - Monkey, do you like that? - If you like it, I like it. I love it. - Sangria, got it. - I'm gonna head over to Automotive. I think we can register for a leaf blower. - How cool would it be? - Great idea. - Why don't you take this with you? - You will not take that with you. I'll be back in a sec. What, honey? What's wrong? I feel like I'm the only one excited about your sister's wedding. I'm just thinking about my SAT's, OK? I just have this feeling I did horrible. Stop. I'm sure you did fine, baby. - You've been working so hard. - That's the point. It's just important, that's all. Hello, ladies. Are we here to register for my wedding? Can we do that? Bridal shower. Plans. Yes, called all your girlfriends and called Seven Señoritas. No, I don't wanna go to Seven S... We always go to Seven Señoritas. The shower needs to be different. Special. Honey, it will be special. All your girlfriends are gonna buy you new thongs to replace the old ones. Let's do a tea. - A tea? - Yeah. - As in "a tea party"? - What? That seems like it's a little bit square. Mama, it's classy. Class... Something you know a lot about. Are you serious right now? My bridal shower's gonna be a tea. Make that happen. Ladies, look at this, a leaf blower. Oh, my God! Red, 58! Red, 58! Set, hut! Good job. Watch the move, watch the move! Good job, J.D.! There you go. Good, run it again. - Get down deep, get down deep! - Attaboy, J.D. There you go, there you go, good work. Let's go, pick it up, let's go! Come on. - All right, let's get some water! - Let's get some water. Pause, go! You get dehydrated out here. You look pretty hot out there. Yeah, you know, it's kind of warm out there. What's that kid doing? Looks like he got himself a little plaything, Coach. Hey, Wade! Why don't you go get Romeo, tell him to get his head back in the game? Let's go, gentlemen, let's go! Time's up! Go! - I'll text you. - OK, yeah. - J.D., let's go. - J.D., man, let's go. Bye. Excuse us, little lady, we have a practice. Let's go. What's your problem, man? You act like this is not State. - Sorry. - Get your head in the game, let's go! On your own time. On your own time, this is my time. - Sorry, Coach. - Let's go, gentlemen! You don't have a chance, you have no chance. I am a chick, and I am winning. - There's no rules. - That's cheating! There it is! - 3 out of 3, she's schooling your ass! - You can't push, you're in the middle. Hey, you can, you can. It's the first time she's ever played. I used to think she was prissy, turns out you're kinda fun. You're a cheater, Garrity. You know what? I want a rematch, though. You can have a rematch. Can you bring me another one while you're over there? I'm clocking out. Hitting the sheets. Wanna come? No, I have a rematch. Don't you wanna watch? I'm good. Night, grandpa. - Push PLAY, push PLAY. - I'm pushing PLAY. You ready? - That's all that matters, here we go. - Wait, wait, Billy! You can't win. 3x11: A HARD RAIN'S GONNA FALL Subtitles: Team Panthers With the participation of: benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb, Ju, ouazo, tactactac, Teardrop, TVnut Hey, good morning. - Hey, honey. - What time is that meeting tonight? That's at 6:00. Man, I cannot make heads or tails out of all this redistricting business. You know, they try to do that every year... redistricting, try to open up East Dillon High. - Never gonna happen. Where's the cream? - You know what? People are fed up this year, people want a change. I'll tell you one thing, everything I'm reading tells me we won't get any funding from the state unless we do it through redistricting. You know what? People don't like confusion. And splitting a town in half, that causes confusion. It's not gonna happen. Where's the cream? Honey, we're out. You want some of mine? It's real good. It's still hot. All right, beer wolf. I let you sleep in as long as I could before we gotta go. Before your favorite day of academics. I think you got, what? History? Time to get up, let's go. I'm not going. You don't wanna go? Fine, I'll stay here, but you're not gonna get much sleep. I don't want any company, I just want to be in bed. Last chance! OK, train's leaving. Seriously, train's leaving. I'm off. See you later. I have seven kinds of tea, all right? It's gonna be magical, I promise you. Yes. You need to stop worrying. I have every... I have everything. It's gonna be fine, all right? No, I know, I know. Don't... I gotta go. All right, thank you, bye-bye. Excuse me, ma'am, but management just told me to escort you off the premises. I wish somebody would. You OK? Yeah, totally, just planning the bridal shower from hell, you know. Mindy wants a tea party. That's good, that's exciting. - How are you doing? - I'm doing good. I just found out the club owner asked Crucifictorious back next week, so... - That's great. - And hopefully if that goes well, we'll kinda do like a regular thing, so, yeah, thank you again for that, 'cause... we couldn't have done it without you. You guys deserve it. Good, I'm glad. Thanks. Well, I, uh... I have to get going 'cause I have to figure out how to make scones, so... My mom's got a scone recipe, if you wanna use it. I'm sure she wouldn't mind. Was that... Was that, like, an offer to help? I guess, yeah. I guess that was an offer to help. Thank you. That would be awesome. Sure. I completely understand. You bet, I will definitely talk to him. No problem. Well, thank you for calling. - Who was that? - That was Wade Aikmen. J.D. has apparently been... half-assing it at practice, last couple of days. I just don't believe that, you know how hard he works. Well, not this week, baby. Not this week, not today! Today, he is, quote, "not himself," unquote, because he is completely distracted by a little 15-year-old minx named Madison. - That girl is a plague! - Oh, please! I cannot believe that boy lied to me! He said he would cool things off, but no, he didn't. And you know what else? I cannot believe you don't think it's a big deal he goes out and sneaks off in the middle of the night. - I do. - You're not acting like it! I don't think freaking out is helping anything. - I'm not freaking out, I'm parenting. - You are freaking out, back off. Hi, honey. Gonna say hi to your mom? How you doing? - I'm good. - You all right? - How was practice? - That was good, too. - It was good, huh? - Yeah. Practice was practice, you know. I got it under control. It's all good. - What's for dinner? - Turkey burgers. - Turkey burgers, really? - Yeah, your favorite. All right, well, cool, I'm gonna go do some homework, all right? "He's got it under control." "It's all good." {\- You good? - }Get your seat belt on. Well, I know how to wear a seat belt, thank you very much. - You need anything from the market? - No, I'm good. - Grandma, be nice, OK? - And listen, I know what we need at the market, you didn't need to bother him. I'm not bothering him, I just wanted to see if he wanted anything special. And I didn't want to go now, I'm missing <i>Oprah</i>, they're doing a life makeover. You ought to watch it, maybe you could learn something. Well, I promise I'll get you back in time for the makeovers. My gosh, where's my purse? Where is my purse? - I left my purse on the couch! - Oh, God, Lorraine! Oh, my God. Lorraine, are you OK? Oh, my God. Are you OK? - I'm sorry. - Grandma, you OK? - Oh, honey... - Go call an ambulance. Grandma! Are you all right? Let's try and turn you over, OK? OK, it's all right. You're OK. - I'm sorry. - No, don't be. You didn't do anything. - I don't wanna be in trouble. - You're not in trouble, Grandma. Just... No, it's OK. - Just try and breathe and... - OK, honey. and relax, all right? We're gonna be fine. I'm so sorry, honey. - You want a soda or anything? - No. Hey, Matt. It's OK, right, she's all right. A few contusions, minor lacerations, - but no stitches, that's the good part. - Oh, thank God. That's not the real problem here, Matt. Your grandmother's mental health is deteriorating. Now, look, we've talked about this. I want you to seriously consider other living arrangements. - Other living arrangements, like what? - Lorraine should be in a place where there are professionals who can be responsible for her. She needs that level of care. Well, let me get this straight. You said we should be looking for some sort of assisted living - for Lorraine? - We're not looking for anything. OK, I know, but... - The doctor just said... - Just because she fell out of a car that <i>you</i> were driving doesn't mean she needs 24-hour assistance, it means that <i>you</i> need to pay better attention to her when you're taking care of her. You're right, I will, Matt, but you know what? What the doctor said make me think that even if I'm paying great attention and you're there... Look, if you wanna bail again, go ahead and bail, go back to Oklahoma, we don't need you. But right now, my grandmother has a home - and I'm taking her to it, OK? - Come on, Matt. - Where is she? Is she back here? - No, Matt, wait. I'll take you. - Just calm down a little bit, OK? - All right... Hey, Tim! Come here. We need to have a little man-to-man. I'm pretty sure we have a good shot against West Cambria. Tim, you know I'm not here to talk about football. I'm here to talk about my daughter. How's she doing? She's hanging in there. Tim, I need to get Lyla back. Son, I don't know what to do, I mean, I cannot go on... thinking that she hates me. And I cannot stand the fact that I've hurt her. And I miss her very, very much. Well, I know she misses you too. You know that? Did she say that? Yes. - I don't know what to do... - You gotta give her more time, Mr. Garrity, that's what I think. That's good, Tim Riggins. That sounds like good advice. That's what I'll do. You're a good man. Am I supposed to walk from here, Mr. Garrity... - Oh, no, no, I'll take you back. - drive me home? No, yeah, oh, yeah. I'll take you back. The current proposal uses Collier Avenue as the dividing line between the two schools... Dillon High School in the blue, East Dillon High School in yellow. Each high school will have roughly 1,000 students, with class sizes capped at 21, and a 25 percent increase in per-student funding. Thank you, Elaine. All right, I'd like to open up the floor to any questions at this time. This whole thing sounds like bureaucratic smoke and mirrors. Where's the pot o'gold that's gonna fund this pipe dream? The state's funding this, Larry. If the majority approves, and I hope they do, you'll see this happening all over Texas. They closed East Dillon for a reason, the place was a cesspool. I assure you, East Dillon will be brought up to code before a single student walks trough the door. - What does this mean for the team? - Bailey,  hell if I know. Are we gonna be the Panthers anymore? - Oh, yes, Barbara, the PTA President. - Thank you, Superintendent Dunley. Ladies and gentlemen, we're faced with some really important decisions. Principal Taylor, we respect you and value your opinion, what do you think? Is this a good idea? Well... Listen, y'all, you know... Redistricting is... is a complicated issue, and, uh... let's face it, we've got a school that's in dire circumstances right now. We've got real, real problems, and I think everybody's aware of that. The way I read these documents, it sounds to me that the only way to get any funding from the state is if we consider this redistricting. - There you go. - Thank you, Principal Taylor. You realize half of my team lives east of Collier Avenue? This thing goes through, they're gonna end up playing for the... East Dillon Giraffes or whatever they're gonna call themselves. I know. Dad? {\OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AND FINANCIAL AID} I'm happy to see you here. - Can we talk? - Sure. You can start by congratulating me. I got into Vanderbilt. Congratulations, baby. Not that I'll be able to go. - Baby. - Don't. Lyla, please. Hey, did you know that your dad called my parents last night? - What? - Yeah, he called them and said that I was a negative influence on you. Do you think I'm a negative influence? No, you're amazing. Good. What did your parents do? My mom started crying, and then my dad got on the phone and started yelling at your dad... if he ever said anything like that again, then he'd have to sue. - It was kind of funny. - Damn it! Well, don't worry. We're not in trouble or anything. - You're not mad at me? - No, I mean... I'm amazing, right? - No, yeah, you're amazing. - Good. - Really amazing. - Good. Tyra, do you want to remind me again why Mindy thinks that it's a good idea to have a party outside in December? Remind me again why my sister thinks it's a good idea to marry Billy Riggins? - That is a good point. - That's a really good point. Speak of the devil! It's Lady Di herself. Hey, what's up? Well, no, I haven't heard back from everybody yet. Well, I mean, we're here, but I don't know if I can change it. - No, what are you trying to say? - Let me see, this is ridiculous. No, I... I got it. Excuse me, Mindy! Hey, this is Landry. Landry Clarke. Yes, you do, you know exactly who I am, that's not funny, stop laughing. OK, Mindy, listen. Me and Tyra have this whole thing under control, we've got the chairs and the tables, there's no need for you to keep calling. OK? We've got it. All right? Bye-bye. Nice. Got anybody east of Boyds Lane? Anybody east of, what's this, Driskill? - He's got a brother. - They can have these middle areas. We need to find out who's on this other side of Michigan Avenue. {\- And this here is... We got that, OK. - }How 'bout this cross street here? - We got anybody going up McAlister? - They move, we just take more. Hey, Lester, this is my freakin' idea. The Snyder boys are gonna be freshmen in two years. They're already as big as houses, they gotta be Panthers. - I got that. - That's a good idea. Hey, Joe, don't we still wanna keep Charles White? So we're gonna have to bring this line over here, - somehow we can compromise... - Hey, what's going on? - Hey, you made it. - What's going on? This redistricting vote came up before we could do anything, but don't worry, there's nothing we can't fix. We're working on it right now. - I thought the line was Collier Avenue. - Well, the line is Collier Avenue, but don't worry, the boosters and Paul Dunley, the superintendent, everybody's on the same page, and the bottom line is, we're all about the Dillon Panthers. We're gonna make sure that the Dillon Panthers stay intact. Here's that beer you ordered, Buddy. If I were you, I'd run his credit card, 'cause I hear his last tab was a doozy. That's real funny, Joe. I will say this, that's the most expensive lap dance I've ever had. All right. How about Hall? Jimmy Hall? He was another defensive end, I think that he moved out of that area too. Matthew? Yes? Where are my slippers, honey? Wh... What? Where are my slippers, honey? They're right there on your feet, Grandma. I need my slippers, Matthew. I need my slippers, honey. I need 'em now! - Grandma, they're on your feet. - Where are my slippers? - Where are they? - Grandma, they're right there. All right, well, I... Grandma, just sit down, OK? Do you need another pair of slippers, or... I need my slippers! Help me! Here. Look, here. Grandma, here, here. Is that good? That what you need? Thank you. Don't mean to step on your toes, but you might wanna try cutting those a little bit thinner because cucumber sandwiches are kinda delicate. Really? Did I just lose a lot of man points for that? I'm trying not to keep count, but, yeah, yeah, you did. Did I tell you that I'm in a band, though? See, there's like 40,000 man points, so you're in the black. - Did I tell you I got my SAT scores? - No. You gonna let me see 'em? Well, you went up. Yeah. You went up like 100 points, that's awesome! Yeah. I needed to go up like 200, to make up for freshman and sophomore year... - It's fine. - Well, this is still really good. Can I say something? Most girls that look like you do, things are easy, they can just coast by on their good looks for the rest of their lives and not really have to... not really have to worry. I mean, I know it sounds stupid, but I'm proud of how hard you've been working for this, it... I mean, it says something. I think good things are gonna happen, you just gotta keep going. Thank you. You still think I'm good-looking, though, right? You still... you've still got... you know... Yeah. I think you're still OK. OK? Thanks. You see that truck right there? It's been on the lot 18 months and it just won't move. I challenge myself. I've said, "By God, today, Buddy Garrity, you're gonna sell this truck." And here she sits! I don't like what's going on between the boosters and this remapping. Well, that's not something you need to worry about. We've got that taken care of for you. I don't want anyone taking care of anything for me. Let me tell you something, this is a whole lot bigger than you. This is about the Dillon Panthers. No one... not me, not Joe McCoy, not any other booster... is gonna stand by and let the Dillon Panthers get dismantled because of some dang politics, I'll tell you that right now. So if you don't wanna know, dont ask. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night. Good night. - What are we doing here, Tim? - I know you were gonna ask that, so... I know this is the first church that you started going to with your whole family, so I just wanted to come... Just come sit down with me for one sec. Please, please, please... Did my dad tell you to bring me here? No, your dad didn't tell me to bring you here. Of course not. Are you mad? I just don't understand what we're doing here. I thought it might just cheer you up. Maybe I don't wanna be cheered up. - Well, I didn't bring you here... - Just leave me alone, please! - Garrity... - Damn it! Come here! Look, Lyla, stop. - Please, please stop. - I don't even know what I'm doing here! Why did I stay here? Why did I let them go? You didn't let 'em go. What was I thinking? Why didn't I go with them? I have no family. I have no family. You can deal, come here. Come here. Baby, it's all right. There's no way that these are their real names. I better get like a billion sister points for this thing. OK, what else do we need to do? - Scones. - OK. You gotta be kidding me! Take it inside! - Mama, you all set over there? - Yes. - Perfect. Beautiful. - All right. Everything looks good, huh? They're here! Come in, sweetie, come in! OK, Tyra, I really have to go, I should have left 20 minutes ago. Yeah, I wonder why you didn't. You got everything you need? Got a camera? All right. Thank you... for everything. You're welcome. - You're very sweet. - Well, I try. Your favorite color and everything. Nice, thank you, yes. - And it goes with this. - Of course! Girl gets the heat? You and Billy are forever, but this is gonna help you keep things fresh. - Is it? That's good news! - It's all I'm saying. OK, I need to make a toast, guys. Thank you so much for coming to my bridal shower. You guys are the best friends any girl could ever have. And I really need to thank my baby sister Tyra 'cause she put this whole day together, and it's really perfect. And even though she's the baby of the family and my younger sister, I look up to her. - I love you, Ty-Ty! - I love you. And maybe, one day, if you're really lucky, you will find a man almost as hot as Billy Riggins! Now, listen to me. - Are you listening to me? - Joe, he's sitting right there. Honey, he knows exactly what I'm talking about, OK? - Hey, what is with the attitude? - What attitude? I didn't say anything. OK, listen to me. In the rain, the name of the game is ball control, OK? Your first read is always your short routes, your safe ones, OK? On the run/pass option, you pull it down and you keep it unless it's a gimme. You are running the football tonight, do you understand? - I got it. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm positive. - Honey, we get it. When it rains, things get a little slippery, like the football! You hear what your mama says? The ball gets slippery. Now listen to me. What I'm talking about is ball control. Now you do that, you win this game, and we're headed to State. - All right, I gotta go. - Go get 'em. - See you, honey. - Run the ball. All right. The gateway to the State championship</i> is through a real Texas toad strangler, folks.</i> It's wet, it's windy, it's semifinal football. Listen up! This is it, fellas, this is what we've been working for, right here. It's a beautiful night for football, gentlemen. Let's go out there and punch 'em right in the mouth. What do you say? Let's go! Clear eyes, full hearts... can't lose! Early in the 2nd quarter and it is really coming down, folks.</i> Mustangs have the ball. There's a pitch left,</i> he's got an opening! Big hit! A fumble!</i> There you go, baby! There you go, baby! - <i>Panthers have the ball!</i> - Way to go, baby! Let's go, let's go! Come on now, J.D.! Blue, 80. Set! Hut! McCoy drops back to pass. He lets it fly! Saracen has got it inside the 10! What a fantastic catch! He got lucky. He got lucky on that one. McCoy, draw to Tim Riggins, he's got a lane!</i> Big Tim Riggins powers into the end zone!</i> Touchdown, Panthers! Let's go, J.D., let's go, baby! Run a regular throw! - <i>McCoy rolls left.</i> - What is he doing?! He's looking deep, he fires a big, long ball... Oh, and it is picked up, intercepted by Cambria! He's got blockers out front, folks, he could score.</i> Oh, my, it's 6! Cambria touchdown, 13-7 West Cambria.</i> You don't throw in this mess! Keep it on the ground! Take the running lane! - Keep it on the ground! - What are you doing? Use your head, run the ball! J.D.! Come here. Listen to me. We're gonna stick to the same game plan, all right? We're down by 7. The game hasn't even started yet. - You got it? - I got it. Protect the ball, keep your head up, and have some fun out there. It's a beautiful night, son. You're doing fine, let's go, come on. Let's go, 1-2, you're on. He is not doing what he's supposed to be doing. He's gotta do what the coach tells him to do! Let's go, offense, let's go! Watch the left! I can't believe it, folks, but McCoy is looking deep and he lets it fly...</i> and that is out in the middle of no man's land.</i> Come on, come on, J.D.! - Let's go, son! - Run it! He takes the snap, opens left... Fumble! And the ball is on the carpet!</i> Cambria has got it! J.D. McCoy fumbles, and West Cambria recovers.</i> You can't throw, you can't even pitch! Pull his ass out! Come on, Coach, pull him out before he hits the spin thing! It's been a real heart-stopper out there,</i> a lot of miscues on both sides of the ball.</i> West Cambria lines up for the punt. The snap is on the ground, Riggins comes out!</i> He just takes him out! The ball's on the ground, Panthers pick it up.</i> He is gonna score, folks! Oh, my! Touchdown, Dillon Panthers!</i> And the Dillon Panthers are down by 1.</i> It is 13-14, - <i>with seconds left to go.</i> - We're going for 2. And it appears Coach Taylor is going for 2!</i> He's going for the win, he does not want the tie.</i> Wait... Go for the tie! This is for State, folks. And here we go!</i> Three, 85! Set, hut! McCoy drops back... He's in trouble right away, and he has got to scramble!</i> He cuts back to the right and, oh, he...</i> No! He's still on his feet! Would you run the ball! He looks downfield... He fires it in the end zone! Caught by Tim Riggins in the end zone, 2 points!</i> And the Panthers of Dillon Texas are going to State! Come here! Good job. That was some game! Look... - I'm sorry. - No, that's OK. No, look, you were right. I don't know how to take care of Grandma anymore. OK, well, we can figure that out. I don't... really want you to leave. I was never going anywhere. Thanks. Come on, let me give you a ride home. - Good job, Coach. - These guys are playing really good. Hey, thanks very much. Thanks, guys. - Come on, this way. - Hey, y'all. Take care, guys. Well, yeah, I know, it was cold. I know, it was crazy. No, it was good out there, it was a lot of fun. It's like playing on a slippery slide. What? You'd better stop. You're gonna get it, all right? - Hang up the phone. - Yeah. What? I said, hang up the phone. - Why? - Hang up the phone! Joe, relax! Can I call you back later? Yeah. Hey, listen. I'm hearing that... this whole redistricting thing? They're completely changing the map. You know how it had that straight line? They wanna zigzag it all over the place. Did you hear anything about that? It's the craziest thing! They're just talking about... It's sounding like a jigsaw puzzle, and I think it's all about football. Can they even do that? I don't know. Well, I don't know either. Guess we'll find out. Isn't it weird to think that East Dillon would be our main rival if this all happens? Big Texas storm! You did a great job, honey, I'm proud of you. - Thanks. - You're gonna have fun, right? J.D., hold up, I wanna talk to you. - Sweetie, just give us a second here. - Why? Why? That was a pathetic display you put on this evening. Pathetic display? I got us to State, didn't I? Boy, you got lucky, OK? We talked about strategy, we talked about running the football! And what are you doing? Pass, interception, pass! - Joe! Calm down. - Honey, stop it. Like you never played in a game in your life! Why don't you go call Madison's parents? Talk to them about it? I will call them every day of the week until that tramp stops coming around our house. You understand me? You know what? I don't care what you do, Dad. Screw you! You don't talk to me like that! Hey, honey? Look. Is that...? Good Lord! - Stay here! - No! No, I'm coming with you. You don't talk to me like that! - Stop it, Joe! - Boy, you don't talk to me that way! Stop it! - Stop! - You will respect me! You will not talk to me that way, ever! Ever! - Y'all OK? - You all right? Honey, how are you? You OK? Come here, let's go inside. Come on, let's go inside. You know what that was? That was a game for the ages. What a game! Why don't you go out? You guys are going to State, there's probably... tons of parties tonight. 'Cause the real parties are when we <i>win</i> State. That's when the real parties are. And then there's one little thing, too. I think I'm OK... hanging with my gal. Especially after a night like tonight. You're not having much fun here, are you? Yeah. - Why? - Maybe I'm just stating the obvious, but you seem to be pretty down around here. I mean, what... What did I expect? To just move in here, and you're gonna... solve all my problems? OK, you know what? I'm not here to solve all your problems, Garrity. I'm not. I'm here to support you no matter what choice you make. I'm your boyfriend, I think I'm a pretty good one. Your dad threw you a good curve ball. But this self-pity that I've been seeing, it's gotta stop. You're better than that. And you can still get into any college you want. Any one you want, still. - How am I gonna afford it? - If you can't afford it, there's scholarships to be had, your grades speak for themselves. And you know what? If it doesn't, there's San Antonio State, and I would love to have you. Did I just say I loved you? Did I? No? 'Cause I'm kinda madly in love with you, and I'll be here no matter what. I love you too. He pushed. He pushed him so hard. - I should have stopped it. - Honey, honey... Listen, don't you go blaming yourself, all right? It's not your fault, don't even go down that road. - But he hit him. - I know. He hit my baby. What am I gonna do? You're not gonna do anything right now. You're just gonna drink your tea... Just leave it be for right now, OK? I'm sorry, babe. Nothing I do is ever good enough for him. I mean, it's always this or always that. I can't take it anymore! - He treats me like I'm some dumb kid. - I understand. I don't wanna see his face again. I don't wanna go back to that house, I hate it. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. What's gonna happen tonight is, you and your mom are gonna stay here. You and your mom are gonna have to talk this thing out, figure out what the next step is... The important thing to know is that you're not alone in this, all right? - Is it my fault or something? - Listen, what he did was wrong. There's no two ways about it, that's just wrong. Whether it's your father or not. This will all work out in the long run. I need a second opinion. Does this make me look fat? - I need to know. - You are sexy! Thank you. See, she says I'm sexy, so I don't know what to tell you. I'm taking these, those are hot, and this. Let's go. - Come on, baby. - Bye, you two. We'll see you kids later.{\ - Bye.} - Thank you! - Bye, sweetheart. I love you! - I love y'all, take care. - Bye. Oh, my God, this place... Somebody just put their gum right on the table. Honey, what's the matter? I don't know what's wrong with me, Mama. Nothing's wrong with you, what are you talking about? Why can't I want that? They look so happy. I mean, I spend all this time trying to go to college, and it's seeming more and more impossible. Honey, listen to me, let me tell you something, all right? I love my Mindy. You know, she was my first baby. And she's so funny and darling, you know, but... she has never surprised me, not one day in her life, bless her heart. But you... You surprise me, honey. Every day since the minute I knew you were coming, till right now. You are a wonder! I have no idea what's gonna happen with you, not a clue, I've no idea what college you're gonna go to, or anything. But I know one thing, with all my heart, that you are gonna have everything that you are dreaming of. You're gonna get everything you're reaching for, honey. You are! And I want you to keep reaching, you keep going. One of these days, you're gonna surprise yourself, you'll see. I won't be surprised, but you will be. I know it. - I love you. - I love you, sweetie, so much. Thank you, Mama. I'm Mark Enderland, this is Jodie Russi, we're with Child Protective Services. We'd like to speak with your family.
