I am here to inform you that you have been invited to training camp in Austin. The quad rugby national team is having tryouts in Austin. And if I go and I make the team, possibly be going to Beijing later this year. - Tyra? - Your mom is the greatest. She volunteered to help me finish out tonight. What is your problem? Your dad, Buddy Garrity. His dirty hands all over my mom, his employee. Your Dad is down in Corpus Christi. He's working on a driving range. Do not believe a word that that man says. And do not get drunk with him. I'm on the wagon now. Sobered up. Six weeks next Tuesday. Tim! - What are you doing? - Dad's here. How about another round, sweetheart? Let's go three, corner. My cue is on fire! Nice shot! Oh Lord, that was nice. Yes! Nice shot! I don't know what's gotten into him. I really don't. I'd say his game's improved quite a bit in the last half hour, wouldn't you? It's weird, huh? Yeah, I'll say. Thank you, darlin'. Watch your back, sir. Don't wanna hit you. This is for all the money. Who's the winners? Who's the winners? All the way home! Oh, now you're up against it. Hey, you wouldn't be hustlin' us here now, would ya? Hustlin' you? Yeah. Hustlin' you, beating you with one hand tied behind my back. Either way, you still owe me 100 bucks. Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Talking to a guy that owes me 100 bucks. The loser who owes me 100 bucks. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. Then how is it you come into this place and that boy can't hit a shot... Boy, you just... Who the hell threw that? No idea. Did you throw that? Me? No. Hey! You wanna fight me? Huh? You wanna fight me? Take me down? Aren't you gonna do anything about this? My boy can handle himself. I'll take you outside. There's gonna be no fightin' here, Buck. You lost. Now pay up and leave. 100 bucks. There's your money. You wanna take me out, you come back and you find me. Get out. Hablar. Hablar. Hablo, hablas, habla, hablamos, hablan. That works.

Matt, this is a watershed moment here. I mean, you're going into an entirely new realm. I got a--um, look... I've got just a little gift for you. - I found this in my dad's glove compartment. - Landry... I found it, I was-- Get that nasty, raggedy-ass thing out of here. Look, come on, come on. Excuse me one second. Now look, you got her at first and inches. But you still gotta read the coverage, okay? Now, I ain't trying to encourage sex out of wedlock. Don't put it on on Smash. Okay. But if you're gonna do it... you're gonna need to think about logistics. You're gonna need a time, you're gonna need a place. And you're gonna need some fresh protection. Yeah, he is right. You got some work to do, son. All right, this is 6th street, Austin. Party central. Eyeballs deep in beautiful women. I don't care about being up to your eyeballs in women. I care about getting to practice. This is a big deal. Hey! How you doin', baby! Whoo! Hey darlin'!

You wanna know why? 'Cause this is a big deal to me. And to you, it seems like you don't wanna pay attention. You don't wanna... - Herc, you-- - How you doin'? I need to know everything about you right now. Your full name. What's your favorite color. Hi, uh, Jason Street. Nice Job! Let's go! Is this your first time here? Actually, I don't really have time for a conversation. So if you could just sign me in, that'd be great. It's not me asking. It's a question on the form. Jason Street. There's your welcome packet. And your room key. There is your jersey. Favorite number? Have fun. I'm already having fun, Mo. I'm gonna get me some Mo later. I'll be here for some mo'. All right. Did you really fall for that? - Kind of. - Push! Where the hell have you guys been?! I don't wanna hear any excuses. What are you lookin' at? Nothing, sir. Quit lookin' around. Get in the chair! Yes, sir. What are you guys looking at? Let's go! Let's play some rugby! Let's go! Yeah? Hi, is Billy in? Billy, some chick's here to see you. Sweetie, I'll be in in a second. What's up? I'actually here about Tim. Well, he's uh... He's drinking again. That's... Deal or No Deal ison, Billy! Yeah. Uh, that's right on schedule. Yeah, well, Tim doesn't see anything wrong with it. And it just seemed like he was doing so much better. So I just thought that maybe you could... you can't help him, okay? Okay. I've done everything I could for him. He chose Walt in this situation. He's made his bed, now he's gotta lie in it. He's just gonna have to live with the decision. All right? Eric, you're my friend, right? I can talk to you about anything, right? Yeah, well... I'll just put it point blank. I strayed outside my marriage. I mean... and the problem is, now she thinks it's more than it is. - Uh-uh. Uh-uh. - Yep. No, no, I'm saying uh-uh, I don't wanna know who it is and I don't wanna know anything about it. I mean, we had a wonderful time. She's a wild cat, you know what I mean? But it's just--I can't... - I mean she-- - Hush down. I may have said some things in the heat of passion... you know, I may have said I was unhappy in my marriage in some ways, but you know how it is. No, Buddy, I don't know how it is. Well, it's not the only problem. She also... she works for me. I know. I know. Hey. Eric, hey, I'm a weak man. - You're a stupid man. - No, I'm a sinner, you know? I'm just looking for a little guidance here. Just a little advice is all I'm asking. - You want some advice? - Yeah, I do. Number one... you should tell this woman, whoever the hell it is, I don't wanna know... that under no uncertain terms that it's over. Number two... you need to go home and take care of your wife and think about those kids of yours. That's all I got to say. I'll let you cover the bill. Oh, I got it, I got it. Thanks. Okay, let's see what we got here. We got, um... Endure... Lasticon, True Fit... We can cancel out Mega, I believe. I think you should think about Lasticon. - Let's just-- - Hold on, wait. God, I mean, this is an important decision here. Matt, you gotta look at everything. Didn't you hear what Smash said? It's all in the details. None of this is gonna matter if I die of embarrassment first. You're not gonna die. Quit being a baby. Can we just get something that protects everyone from everything. Like--yes, those. Let's get those. - Let's go, let's go. - Okay, fine. You sure you don't need like a back-up or something just in case those don't... There's like 12 of them in here. I know, but... - Hi. - Hey. I saw Matt Saracen buying condoms today. Oh. You know anything about that? No. Really? Nothing? Well, he was either buying 'em for you or he was buying 'em for somebody else. I think you better come talk to me. Okay. Are you and Matt Saracen having sex? No. We're thinking about it. You're thinking about it. Are you thinking about pregnancy? Are you thinking about sexually transmitted diseases? Well, I mean, obviously. That's why he's buying condoms. Oh, I see. So you're just buying condoms. And then when you buy condoms, that just makes you ready to make love to somebody. - Making love? - Don't do that. Don't you smirk at me right now. I am very upset! You are not allowed to have sex! You're 15 years old! I just--I don't see what the big deal... It's just one body part going into another. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's not just one body part going into another body part. And the fact that you think that it's just one body part going into another body part makes me real clear on the fact that you really are not ready for this. And I need you to be able to hear that. I need you to be able to hear me say that to you. I'm listening to you. Let me tell you what the big deal is. Let me tell you what can happen. What can happen is that you can be hurt. And you can be degraded. And you can become hard and you can become cynical. And I don't want that to happen to you. This is something that's special. It's something that's meant for people who are in love. Okay, I-I understand. And you can wait. I want you to be able to talk to me about it. Okay. I mean, we're talking, right? Matt. - Hey. - Hey. What's up? What's going on? So my mom saw you buying condoms last night. Are you ser-- Did she-- is she gonna tell your dad? No, she said she wasn't going to. So then we're not gonna do this. - We're not gonna have sex. - No, we are gonna do this. And I just don't understand what the whole hysteria is over losing your virginity. Uh, well, I got us Bradley's lake house. You told Bradley? So Brad-- does the entire team know now? No, just-- just Bradley. And Bradley's Bradley, so Bradley won't say... Bradley's good. You don't need to worry. He won't say anything. - Okay. - Okay. All right, so here's the thing, Matty-boy, 180 seconds. Anything else is failure. 180. I can do 180. I can do that. Hey, look, man, you gotta use your camera phone. I don't even have a phone. You don't-- I'll let you use mine. But you gotta have something... All right, 7, don't let those rookies tell you what's going on. You remember the first time you drove a car? Yeah, I crashed my grandma's car and now Landry drives me around. Good look to you, 7. Yeah, baby! Dig! Dig! That's my boy! Hey, Riggs, that's real cute. You got your pop cheering you on. Mr. Riggins, can I help you? Hey, Coach. First team over the ball! Why don't you give him more carriage? He's as good as that Smash kid. I tell you what, we're right in the middle of practice right now-- if you'd like, you can stand over there on the sidelines... I'm serious, why don't you just give him more carriage? That's all. I'm thinking maybe we can talk about this at more appropriate time. I'm in the middle of practice right now. You're more than welcome to stand on the sidelines. Hey, Coach, Coach. You're really king of this castle, aren't you, huh? You think you're better than me, is that it? Over on the sidelines'll be fine. All right, let's go! Get 'em, son! - Coach. - Yeah? Uh, you know that camera that we got from Boosters? - Yeah. - It's missing. What do you mean it's missing? Can't find it. It's a $3,000 camera. You better find it. It's just that... it's great to feel like a part of a team again, you know? I've got the least experience, but I'm pretty sure I'm a better athlete than two of'em. And that just leaves this one guy. - Hello. - Ta da! What? You know, I think I can take him, you know? Babe? Lyla? Am I boring you? Are you with me? No, I just... my dad just walked in and started making out with my mom. What the hell you doing? You on a phone? You're at a party! Are you at a party? No, no party. No, it's a par-tay. It's not a party. I thought it was gonna be all work stuff. Well--it is. It's just a couple of the boys, baby. It's no big deal, okay? Buddy, you're crazy. You are beautiful. Could you, uh--I spilled a little. Will you get me a paper towel out from underneath that sink? Right over there. What are you doing? Oh, I... Hey. I'm just... I was designated to pick the next CD. And we're kind of out of options. - Well, what do you got? - God, you know... I don't even recognize half of these. What's right there? That one you just touched? - I don't know. - That's a classic. Gotta go with that. Loretta Lynn. Nice. So, look, I just wanna say I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't mean to come off... Oh, no no. Me. I...I'm sorry. I was such a bitch. It was... a long day. I'm sure it was. I'm Jason Street. Uh, Suzy Quinnlen. Nice to meet you. So, uh... so do you work for the team? Oh, no, that was, you know, just a day job. I'm trying to get my business off the ground. And you know, every little bit helps. What's your-- what's your business? Ink. I'm a tattoo artist. Seriously? Seriously. That's awesome. Are these yours? All right, there's four of 'em. - Thanks, man. - Hey, Coach. Yeah. We got a problem. It's about the camera. What about the camera? Uh, one of the assistant coaches saw Walt Riggins going in the AV room right before the camera went missing. Which coach? Crowley. Saw Tim Riggins' dad come out of the AV room. Yep. The camera was there. He goes in the room, he comes out, it's gone. What do you want me to do? Don't do anything. I'll take care of it. - Thanks. - Yeah. How you doing? Fine, how are you? Good, good. Sorry to bother you at home. It's not a bother. What can I do for you? Well, uh... We're missing a camera from the AV department. Are you going door to door and asking all the parents about this? No, I'm not. Well, I don't know-- Well, I'll tell ya, we had a coach over at the school and he saw you walk out of the, uh, the AV room. So... He said he doesn't know where the camera is, Coach. What else do you need? All right, I'm sorry to bother you. Thank you. Thank you for your time. - Hey, Coach! - Yeah? You go to Bradley's place and ask his dad - if he stole the camera? - No, I didn't do that. I'm just curious why you'd come to mine then. I didn't know you were there, I'm sorry. Granted, he's made some mistakes, Coach, but that's my father in there. You're right, I apologize. I'll see you at practice. Angela, please. Earl Stackhouse, he's my buddy. He needs a front office girl. I told him how great you were. I'm sorry. I mean, I know what I said, but I mean, in the heat of passion... Here's hundreds. Here's $600, $700. Just walking around money, okay? Can we just make this easy? I'm sorry. You're gonna be all right. So what was it like, your first time? You ever watch the nature channel? I'm... I'm really-- I'm just kidding. - Okay? - Oh, okay. You don't have to do this. You know that, right? Yeah, I know that. I just--I want to. Because there will always be a steady stream of horny football players in Dillon, I can guarantee. No, I mean... Matt's different and I really like him. And he likes me. And it's just the perfect opportunity for me to control the whole experience. You know... Get the information and gather the data. Wow, that sounds real hot. For Matt. Throw the guy a bone while you're gathering your data. As soon as if left my hands I knew it was bad. I saw him running, and I was the only one that had a clean shot at him. And the only thing going through my head was that I just wanted to kill him. Just wanted to obliterate him. I put my head down and I went... right into him. I guess the next thing was... I came to a couple minutes later, and my parents were just standing over me. And my dad was just holding my mom. She was screaming and he was crying. First time I'd ever seen my dad cry. And he just kept on saying, "Get up, son. Get up. Get up, son." And I wasn't. I couldn't. Couldn't do it. I think if-- if it was me, I would spend my whole life wondering why. Yeah, there's-- there's a lot of that. There's a lot of that. You just get angry, you know? And you start wondering, you know, "God, did you do this to me?" You know, was it fate? Was it just some dumb accident? Was it my fault? And I prayed and prayed and prayed, and the only answer I ever got was that... I couldn't walk. I can't walk. So... I'm just ready to get rid of that, you know? Get rid of that anger, you know, and just-- just have some peace. Hey, after-school special! Let me show you something! This is the best jukebox in town. Casino! You got that right. How about that? Let's go, after-school special. Dance party. Dance party. You wanna get out of here? Yeah. What's this one? Oh, that's the Chinese symbol for "wealth." It's also the Chinese symbol for "douche." Do they have a Chinese symbol for cripple? No Chinese symbols, no barbed wire, and no naked ladies. Just hold on there, shooter, I'm looking for something, I just can't find it. Is this your station? Yeah, right there. What's, uh... what's this one? Which one? The red, yellow, and blue... Oh, that was the wallpaper in the hallway at my grandma's house. - Y'all were close? - No! She was a bitch on wheels and everyone was glad when she died. - Nice. - I think the wallpaper was pretty. Oh, here it is. Found it. It's Sanskrit. This top one. It says "peace." It's perfect. How you feelin', buddy? Want me to cook you up an omelet? No, I'm good, Dad. Gonna fix my headlight. I was gonna take that back, I swear. I defended you, Dad. - Timmy, this is no big deal. - No, it is. And you know that. I want you to leave. Get out. Okay, you see how easy this is, son. Just watch this. Nu-uh. - Hey! - Hey. Did Tyra drive you? Uh, yeah, okay, so my parents think I'm at Lois' and I need to be home by 11:00. So we should get right down to the sex then. Right? Good. Where in the bathroom is the aspirin? Look-- look in the-- underneath the sink. Poured you some wine. That might help. Hey, were you planning something special for tonight? Yes, I'm making you a beautiful dinner. Just poured you a glass of wine. And if you get rid of that headache, you may get lucky, darlin'. What's this? These yours? No. Well, they're sure as hell not mine, so what would our 15-year-old daughter be doing with these? Yeah. I think I need to talk to you for a second, hon. I... I saw Matt Saracen buying condoms earlier this week. I'm sorry, say that again. You heard what I said. Oh, I'd love to hear you say that again. No, I'm not saying it. And you were gonna tell me this when? I talked to Julie about it. - Oh, you did? - Well, yeah, I did. And did you also tell her that if he even touches a hair on her head that she's gonna be sent to a nunnery in Rome, and I'm gonna rip his head off right afterwards. No, but what I told her is she's too young and she's not ready. And then I tried to make the best case that I could - against it. - Oh, that's good. It might even help if we just get her her own apartment. 'Cause that's pretty darn stern. The reason that I didn't consult with you and that I didn't talk to you about it is because I felt that you might start to freak out. Which is I think what you're doing right now. Where is she right now? She's at Lois' now, studying. Wait a second. Hey, how you doing? This is Coach Taylor. Uh, sir-- Yeah. Hey, this is Coach Taylor. I was just wondering if my daughter's over there. Yes, sir. Do you know if she was planning on coming over there? No, everything's fine. Okay, thank you. Why don't you find out where our daughter is? Hey. What are you doing back here? You're not supposed to be in the kitchen. Can you take a break? No, no. It's the dinner rush. And, you know, my manager's breathing down my back. I got a table full of crazy, middle-aged women. No, I can't take a break. I'm sorry. What? Forget it. Tim! What? The deer's staring at me. The deer's... Well, just, uh... don't look at it. I just--I feel like it's judging me. Can--can you cover it up or something? Yeah. All riht. Good, see? He's sleeping. See, it's hard not to look at you 'cause you're so good-looking. Damn? - Is it really hot in here? - Um, yeah, I guess. Do you want me to open a window? Yeah, that'd be really great. Yeah, okay. Good. Now it's cool. Does it just smell like wet dog? You know what? Let's not do this. N-no, no, no. No, no, no. I told you, I really wanted to. No, no, no, no, no, you really don't. And that's okay. 'Cause we don't have to. We--we don't? No. We can just hang out. Or eat. Or I don't know, whatever. Really? Yeah. But don't touch me right now. That's-- just give me a minute, please. Oh, alright. Yeah. Yeah. What time is it? You know, you and I have the exact same amount of experience being parents. We've been doing this job the same number of years and months and days as each other. And the truth of it is that we just don't have any control. You know, for the most part we're just winging it. And, you know, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do in this situation. But I'll tell you what, the most important thing to me... is that my daughter be able to talk to me. A girl is entitled to that with her mother. My mother used to tell me that I was gonna hell if a guy ever even touched me. And you know that didn't work. I'm sure as hell not gonna do that to Julie. And we raised a smart, responsible... moral girl. And I have faith in us. And I have faith in her. Now we just gotta let her go. I'm sorry if I hurt you. One...two...three. Hup, see... Wait, no, hey... No, you're cheating. I can't win if I don't cheat. Oh, those are very good ethics right there. That's great. Oh, wait. You have the ugliest feet I have ever seen. Oh, shut up! I do not. Because, look, your second toe is all bigger than your first toe. It's a sign of royalty. Oh, yeah-- what are you, like, the royal duchess of Dillon or something? Okay, look who's talking, Mr. I-have-dirt all-over- my-feet. Well, I mean... Oh, my God. We were gonna have sex tonight and didn't even clean the bottoms of your feet? - I was gonna keep my socks on. - Ew! Whatever. Ready, let's go. One more time. Okay. - Ready? - All right. One...two...three. Hey, Buck. It's amateur hour here. It's that punk kid from the other night. Yeah. Come on, fellas. Let's have some fun. Yeah! He fire you? Thank you. Mr. Garrity fired you? Why? I really don't want all these questions... - Did something happen? - Everything. I don't wanna talk about it right now. Hello? Hey, Tyra. Teresa. Your boy Tim's here fixing to get his ass kicked. Okay, I gotta go. I'll be back. We're gonna finish this later. Come on, boy! What's it gonna be, huh? - What do you got for me? - Give him hell, Buck! Boy wants to do professional wrestling! Come on, man. What's the matter? Your daddy ain't here to help you out, huh? Come on, you need a hand? Get the hell off him, man! Get the hell off him! - What are you doing? - He was the one that kept it going! He's just a kid, man! He's a kid. He's just a kid. Where's that beer? Hey, uh...Jules. - Uh-huh. - It's... kind of... It's kind of... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We are so dead. Um... Kill the lights. Do you want me to walk you to the door or something? Are you kidding me? My dad's gonna kill you if he sees you. Where are my keys? Julie, I love you. Uh...what? I love you. Um...uh, me too. I love you too. I'll...I'll call you later. Okay. Bye. - Uh... - Are you all right? Are you all right? Uh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm sorry. And I know I'm late. And I know I should have called because that's the whole reason you guys bought me this cell phone and I'm probably grounded for the rest of my life, but I was with Matt. And then we fell asleep and... And--no, no, no, no. Nothing like that happened. Not what you're thinking happened. Because that didn't happen and I swear to you guys that nothing happened. Good night. And, uh, yeah. Uh, but, uh... thanks for the talk. Good night. Seeing the cross of sacrifice and the empty tomb. We rejoice in the awesome love of our Lord Jesus. And we take comfort in the eternal forgiveness that God gives to all who believe in Jesus and walk with him. Let us go in peace and serve the Lord. - Amen. - Amen. So I was thinking, you know, when we're at the, uh, the, uh, store... we could get a newspaper, look through the want ads. Or, you know, we could go see a movie. That might, you know, make you feel a little better. Where are we going? Mother, what are we doing here? Mom... Just stay in the car. - What... - Stay in the car, I said! What are you... Mama... Mother. Mother. Hey, Buddy! Oh, God. You lyin' son of a bitch! Lyin' son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! You could have at least let me keep the job! What were you thinking? Pam. What the hell happened to you? I, uh... I brought you something. You all right?
