- Chop shop. You'll make more money in two months than you could in two years. - I sure didn't see you coming. - I didn't see you coming either. I can refer you - to the adoption agency. - What if I don't want to have the baby? You provided this girl the information - to get her child aborted. - I did not, ma'am. Get out of here! Calvin's dead. Bill, now you see what we're concerned about out here? There're about 18, 19 more holes all throughout this field, not to mention all the glass that's in it. Bill, there's a pothole over there on the 35-yard line. You drive your car over it, you're gonna pop your hubcap right off. When you're driving around on the football field. We usually don't drive around on the... I'm not gonna put my players at risk because they can't maintain their field. We got playoffs... We played on this field all year, and no Lion has fallen from the pride. Yeah, and remember, Joe, you got to win friday night to make the playoffs. - You got to win first. - You gotta win. Did I hear the voice of a dead Panther? You know, coach, you really ought to consider investing in some turf. - They've a legitimate concern here. - Exactly. Very much so. Let me recommend something. It's simple. How about a neutral field? How about Joe's backyard? I'm the conference director here. The decision is on me, all right? Coach, you feel like you got a handle on this? It's saturday, the game's friday. I can promise you this field will be in fine shape for play by then. All right, gentlemen. We're adjourned. Y'all know where the parking lot is, coach. Mom, it's a one-month training program. They house you, they feed you. They bring in amazing people to speak. - And Jimmy Carter's part of Habitat. - I know who Jimmy Carter is, honey. Well, do they know how old you are? 'Cause I think that could be an issue for you. Well, by the time I'm completely done with the training program, I'll be 18, and normally, they don't make this kind of offer to somebody my age, but I wrote a really amazing essay. I have prior work experience, great recommendations... All right. Where, when, how long, and how much? It'll be in New Orleans in about three weeks. What? Honey, no. - Mom, it's only $3,000. - Only? Honey, you're hilarious. Half of it they'll pick up with grant money, and I have $500 saved up, and if I pass my government class, I can graduate this semester, and next semester I was only gonna take - electives anyways. - No, no, no, and no. It's wonderful that you like Habitat so much, but you're finishing school. - You haven't looked at the brochures. - I need your help. Would you go grab those things and start working on that stove, please? Thanks. Hey, little man. Hey, buddy. Come on up! Good boy. - Brought you your dog back. - I see that. Mom hates him even more now. - She says he reminds her of you. - I'll take that as a compliment. I think that's how she meant it. Brought you your stuff. - My mom threw it out. - Well, that was nice of her. She's mad. Never pictured you as a snow globe kind of guy. My mom gave me that one. I got to get that. Yeah. Riggins' Rigs. The baby's coming! The baby's on its way. - Who are you talking to? - It's Tim. You wanna talk to him? No. We practiced this! No, for real d-day? She's gonna pop or what? Like, for real, the baby is, like... Hang up the phone and take me to the hospital! - <i>Where are my keys?</i> - All right. What is it? I'm becoming an uncle today. - Right now? - Yeah, right now. I gotta go. - Let's just go. I don't care! - I got to put my pants on! Mindy! Mindy, you can't drive right now. My boots. There's my pants. I'm coming! Mindy, wait, wait, wait. I wish he would have been more like you, Vincent. No... I wish he would have stayed on the team. No, it just happened. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He loved you. He loved all of us. Did you speak to the cops yet? Jess, if I go to the cops, I go to jail. I don't see my mom no more. I don't see her get better, nothing. Vince, you were in the car. You did not do a thing wrong. It doesn't matter. Look, I know I laid a lot on you last night. That was wrong of me, I shouldn't have done that. It was stupid. No, no, no. Look, I'm glad you came to me. I got to trust you. You can't say nothing to nobody about anything. You know I won't. I gotta go. What's going on, man? You getting any heat on this? Nah. You ready for payback? I'm done. 4x12: LABORING Subtitles: Team Lions With the participation of: Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, Fuyopo, GillesSilb, Mpm, Ouazo Four days from Thanksgiving and five days from Armageddon.</i> I'm talking blue versus red, West versus East,</i> Panthers in the playoffs or Taylor's revenge.</i> - <i>Who's got something to say out there?</i> - <i>I got something to say, Sammy.</i> I say that Eric Taylor better enjoy his turkey on thursday,</i> 'cause friday's gonna be his comeuppance.</i> He quit on the Panthers twice, and on his own team the 1st game of the season?</i> - <i>Stole that boy Cafferty from us.</i> - Why don't you turn that stuff off? ... playoffs, this game shouldn't even matter.</i> But it's all good, 'cause he's...

Yeah, I've been Standing here for about 20 minutes, trying to perfect this pose. I just didn't want you to think that just because of our scandalous romance, I had forgotten about the debt that I owed you, so... It's not exactly the... The response that I was looking for. No, it's... It's great. I'm sorry. You know, my mind's just... We're going to church service right now, 'cause, you know, Calvin Brown, he got shot the other night, and, you know, he died. Calvin brown, Vince's friend? The one... Yeah, yeah. And so I'm... You know, I'm just, like... No, I'm sorry. This is not the best timing. You should have shut me up a long time ago. I bet you are Landry. Yes, ma'am. How you doing? - Landry Clarke. - I'm good. I'm Bird. Pleased to meet you. Got a lock for that bike? No, ma'am, I do not. She gonna need a lock for that bike.

We need some pressure. Hey, coach. Coach Crowley said we're gonna practice at Carroll Park? Yeah, everybody except for you. Hey, Stan! Stan, where's Tim Riggins? His brother's having a baby with his wife. His brother's having a baby? How come you know that and I don't know that? I left you a note on your desk. This is gonna be a bad week. Don't leave notes. You got something to say, say it face-to-face. - Face-to-face. - Great. - His brother's having a baby... - Yeah, I understand. Thanks very much. - What do you mean everybody except... - 'Cause of your hip. I'm fine, coach. I can play through. I can gut it out. You want to gut it out? Why don't you gut it out and fill up the gatorade jug? That'd be just fine. - I want five! - Thanks, coach. This looks great. This looks real good. It's very smooth. - You're gonna like it. - Great. Hey, Luke. Come here. I'm sorry. - Appreciate that. - As far as the work I want you to do, is I want you to take care of your hip. That's the only work I want you doing. Hey, put that jug down. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right, coach. Just seems like we're making a bigger mess than... Fill that jug up. This place is ridiculous. When did you get here? - What happened? - I'm going nuts. They threw me out! - What do you mean? - Nurse Ratched threw me out. She said I was too enthusiastic, whatever that's supposed to mean. What'd Mindy say? Mindy said, "Get the hell out." Well, no, Mindy screamed, "Get the hell out." It's ridiculous. I got a baby being born and I can't even be inside with them. I'm going nuts, Tim! - And how many of those have you drank? - What does it have to do with anything? - I don't know. Five? - Five? Here, you're cut off. - Why? - You're cut off. Come on... Fine. What? This isn't funny, Tim. Let's go, let's go! Let's get this chalk down! Come on, stay with me. What's up, coach? This is a baseball field. It's a football field now. Let's go! Vince, I'm sorry to hear about your friend... You know, it's got to be tough. What do you care for? You didn't even know his last name. Calvin Brown, and... and I care about my teammates, and you're my teammate, so... Hey, Landry, thanks. Bring it up. Helmets on. Let's go! - Let's go! - All right, listen up. This is the field we're gonna be using this week, understood? You pissed off? I'm pissed off too. Good. Use it. What's this bull I hear on the radio about them not letting us use our field? Don't worry about the damn radio. We've heard all that crap before. Listen to me. Word of the week... Focus. Is that understood? Is that understood? Let's break it down. I ain't gonna have any knees left for this Friday. Shut up, Tinker, man. If I can do this with my hip, you can do it with your knees. Yo, man, whose idea was this, anyway? Landry's. Yes, it was my idea. Thank you for pointing that out. And a brilliant idea, 'cause if we can't practice on our field, then they're not gonna practice on their field, end of story. - How are you? - Just fine. Good. - Can I talk to you? - Come on in. It won't take but a moment. Shoot, you live at least 50 miles away. It must be something important. I can invite you into my home. I just wanted to see how you're holding up. Thank you. It's not blowing over like we... like we hoped it would. You saw the article. Did you see it? - We need to set the record straight. - You should make a statement. - The sooner, the better. - I agree. I think I should. I'd like to get the facts out there. Good. Good. Actually... it's part of the reason I came over. We spent some time last night, a little overtime, actually, drawing up something for you, and we'd like you to think about it, if you would. We've lined up a reporter who's friendly. - Paul, this is an apology. - We have a friendly reporter... "Inappropriate conduct"? - But that is inaccurate. - The paper's gonna bury it. The Panthers will be in the playoffs, and everyone's gonna be happy. - You're being bullied. - And you'll get to keep your job. I do live 50 miles away. The reason I drove here is because you're very good at what you do. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose y job either. I hope you take this very seriously, okay? I know you'll make the right decision. Give my best to Eric. This magazine sucks. I'm the dad, right? - Yes, you are. - And it's my baby. It's trying to, you know, to... - Claw. - To claw his way out, - or her way or whoever, but... - Its way out. Its way out. - Are you ready to be an uncle? - I've been waiting 38 hours for this. All right. I'm going back in. - Get in there. - I'm going. - Sir? - I'm going in there. - Sir? - You can't stop me! I'm going back in! I'm the dad. I'm the dad. - We got this under control. - Get out! I am the dad! All right. It's all right. Go. Help her breathe. Help her breathe. Keep her focused and... Just breathe. You know what you're doing. Just breathe, just breathe... - Do you want a ride? - No. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to be easy on your mother this week. I want you to be easy on your mother this week. It's gonna be a long one. You do this for me, and what I'll do for you is we can talk about this house-building or whatever. Deal? Deal. - What are you gonna do about the car? - I'm gonna clean it. You go to school. - Go to school. - Want some help? Nope. You go to school. Sammy, that field they play on don't have near enough seats,</i> and the neighborhood... I'm gonna tell you the truth.</i> I don't feel safe taking my family over there.</i> Things are just different on that side of town.</i> Na, na, caller hold on.* There's a lot of good folks</i> - <i>over in east Dillon.</i> - <i>I'm not saying that ain't true,</i> but I was told they have gang members on that...</i> - Why you stopping? - Get out there! - Let's go! Come on, guys. - Coach. What the hell is this? It's just toothpicks. - Get it cleaned up. - Let's spread out. Let's get them out of there one by one. Take them out. Let's go! We can't start practicing till we get the field cleaned up! - Get it out. - You all right? Anybody got a toothpick? I understand it took west Dillon two hours... Two hours for west Dillon to pick all those toothpicks out of that field. Anybody want to share who the genius was that came up with this master plan? I didn't do it. You look a bit tired there. How you feeling? Feel great, coach. Ready for practice. Good. You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna have some fun. What we're gonna do is, we're gonna let Lance kick a 40-yarder. And if he makes that, we're gonna begin our practice, but until he does... we'll run jingle jangles. Let's go, right now. Stand up. Let's go. Let's go, 2-1. It is a beautiful day! This wasn't on school grounds. She's not my student, and I followed district protocol all the way. I'm not saying you don't have a case. - Good. - If you're telling me the whole story, you've got one hell of a wrongful-termination suit. They're trying to tell me I've got to make a big public apology. You don't need to make an apology. I don't? But if you don't and they take your job, I'll file that in court, - and I got a pretty good idea we'd win. - Okay, good. But I want you to know something, Tami. Cases like this can drag out. They can take a long time. Well, what do you mean? I mean, when you say "long time", is that months or...? It could take years. And it's possible we could get you reinstated at the end of it all, but I doubt that. And then while the case is pending, you're... You're gonna have a hard time getting work as principal when this is going on. My record is exemplary. I understand that, Tami, but there's law, and then there's life. Uncle Tim. - You make it true or what? - See for yourself. It's a boy. Come on over, man. This is Steven Hannibal Riggins. What? Come on, y'all. Come on, now. Come on, now, y'all. Come on, now! I mean, this has gotten out of hand. - They ought to find other things to do. - You think so. Where's the meat? I don't cook flesh, Dad. Your daughter made dinner, 'cause she knew we needed the help. - Thank you so much. - You're busy, so I thought I'd help out. Thank you. I appreciate it. Hey, thank you. - You're welcome. - That toothpick thing had everybody in an uproar today. Kids will be kids. What'd the lawyer have to say today? He had a lot to say. Well, I wasn't there. What did he say? I don't know. Do we have to talk about it at dinner? I'm just asking. Did he say anything about the statement? - I need to talk to somebody else. - All right. - Do you want me to get that? - I'll get it. Thank you, honey. - <i>Lions suck!</i> - You know what? Go to hell. Youall want any of this? - You still have some. - This brisket for your mom. - Hey, there. - I made this for you. Here. You're giving me your iPod? Well, no, it's a loaner, but I made you a playlist. You made me a playlist, Jess? Yeah, I made you a playlist. It's for you to practice. Kind of like a slow jams mix? - How you doing on that grill? - Everything's going good, ma'am. All right, now. How's it going, son? What's up? I found him. - Where at? - His punk ass laying low about two and a half hours away from here in Bubbat county, - hiding like a little bitch. - You sure it's him? Man, for sure. Tomorrow night... You in? You know I'm down. It says "Landry." Yeah, you got it... Right there. Press play. This is... This is all just crowd noise, though, Jess. It's a football thing. You know...? So I listen... I listen to this while I'm kicking. While you're kicking, while you're practicing. Just use it. Practice to it, okay? - All right. - Well, thank you. One of these days, fellas. I'm jealous. I'm so jealous. That's what I thought. Let me talk to you for a second. You're a good dude. And Jess... She deserves the best. I'm glad you two are together. Make her happy. It's pretty wild, huh? How do you get away with just sleeping like this? I think he's winking at me. All right. - You want to ride into work together? - You're good. - Be a dad for a day. - You serious? - We got two cars coming in. - Yeah, I can take care of two cars. Can you? Be a dad for a day. Hell, be a dad for a week. Thanks, man. All right, little man, keep your guard up. Stay angry. I'll see you. Thanks, man. You did good. Thanks, man. I'll see you. You're not angry, are you, stevie, hmm? You love your daddy, don't you, hmm? You love your daddy? Your daddy loves you. Yeah, I will put men on this. Don't you worry about that. As many men as I can spare. Panthers did this, Michael. I don't know if I'd jump on that right away, Buddy. But you know me, I'm gonna follow up on it. - What do you want to do about the team? - Get them over to Carroll park. - I'll meet you over there when I can. - Yes, sir. Why this nonsense have to come to my school? Trouble always seems to be drawn to you, Levi. I don't know. Yeah, ever since you came. I guess you about right. Did you hear what happened over here? Yeah. I'm sitting here with Wade Aikmen, actually. And we're gonna put you on speaker. I talked to principal Burnwell twice. And we just wanted to call you to talk this whole thing over. Eric, I just wanted to assure you that if any of our players had anything to do with this, I'll suspend them from the team if I have to. They won't play. So how bad is the damage over there? Do we need to call the conference director? Well, I just got off the phone with him, Wade.</i> - And what are you guys thinking? - You know what I'm thinking? Maybe you give me a call back in an hour. I'd like to talk to my wife. I'll call you in about an hour. Thanks, Wade. - I'll see what I can't find out. - All right. You mind closing that door? Hey, babe. How you holding up? I am not playing on a fair field here.</i> I know. That makes two of us, hon. You gonna be all right? All right, I'll see you at home. All right. Do you love it? That's an understatement. Oh, man. Never thought I'd say this, but I do feel like I figured it out, you know? Figured out...? Life! - Life! - What it's all about, you know? This. You know, owning this land, and Billy, and just his son, and... The shop doing as well as it is, and... You know, I don't... It's just so... I'm happy. And I can honestly say that. It's so great. Tim, I love you. We can't do this. I'm sorry. I'll be... - Why are you here right now? - What you say that to Landry for, huh? Yo, Vince, come on! A second! I'll be coming right down! I'm coming! I ain't got time for this. - I don't got time for it right now. - Hell, no. - You think I'm stupid? - Stupid about what? You think I don't know what you're up to right now? Hell, no. I got something to do. Why are you here? - You don't! - I know that good guy that's inside. You got your good guy. You got your good guy! - Landry's so good for me, right? - Woman, get out of my way. He's such a good guy, right? And you're horrible, right? That's exactly what I am! I am a monster! That's what I am! I'm that guy! Vince, come back. You Tim Riggins? 33... You're the football star, huh? Used to be. What you been doing in here? Just fixing cars, sir. Need to ask you a few questions... About some missing cars. Say, youngster, you ever fired off one of these? - No. - Short barrel. Your pops used to carry that gun or one just like it. Your pops... Thug. You cross him, you best believe you was gonna get got. He say you ain't got no thug in you. What you say? I say I'm in the car, ain't I? Go on, take you a drink, then. Steel up them nerves. Go. When we get there, we're gonna park about a block away from the house. It's a trap house. There's only 2 doors. One in the front and one in the back. I'm gonna walk up with this sawed-off, blow holes through the front door. Hell, by then he either down, or he running towards the back door. And that's where you waiting for his ass. That's payback, son. He ain't stupid enough to keep the bag on him at the house, so I ain't saying we coming up with money. What I am saying is what I find or what you come up on, we split up the middle, 50/50. You all right with that? That's good? What the hell wrong with you? Where the hell you going? Get your ass back in this car. What you gonna do? Man, you acting like a little bitch. You better get your ass back. No, this is one deal you can't renege on, son. Ain't no backing out! Backing out ain't a option! What you gonna do, son? If I get back in that car... My mama's not supposed to bury me. I'm supposed to bury my mama! Looks like to me somebody gonna be burying the both of you, 'cause you gonna die you don't get your ass back in... Now. Do what you got to do, then. Go ahead, man, do what you got to do, yo. Your old man was right about you. You ain't nothing but a soft-ass little boy. You think it's over, youngster? No, it's far from over, Junior. I got you. I got you, you little bitch! So this is all to say we're still working on it. Those were big tires did that damage. We don't know every truck in town that size... Yet, but we're gonna check them all out. - We'll find them. - Sheriff, if... If I may. Every parent on our team was contacted. Every single player was accounted for. This was not a retaliation. Retaliation? For the toothpicks. Toothpicks? Yeah, that's a prank. - Really? - Did you see what you did to our field? Do you have any idea how many man-hours it took? Coaches! Coaches! Please! Look, I know we got a lot of hard feelings here. But look, the thing we got to remember here is that in the end, this is just a football game. Hey, Will, you know what? My family's been getting threatening phone calls all week long, all times of the night. My home has been vandalized, and my field has been destroyed, so don't patronize us and tell us it's just a damn football game. I'm sorry. I know the longer this goes on, the worse this is just gonna get so I'm just gonna cut to the chase. I spent the last 24 hours on the phone talking to every school from Kingdom come to Timbuktu. With the short notice and Thanksgiving coming up, we couldn't find a neutral site. But... There is a proposal from west Dillon. You have got to be kidding. This is our home football game! I didn't do it. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Game's gonna be at Herrmann field. I'm sorry, babe. I heard they were talking about doing that. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm gonna make a statement. What statement are you gonna make?
