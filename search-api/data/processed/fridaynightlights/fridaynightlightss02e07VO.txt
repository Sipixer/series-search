- We wear that in Bresil. - We're not in Brazil. That's your ex-girlfriend. You're kicked off the team. I'm sorry about that. You wanted to play football? Who doesn't want to be a panther? You wanna come by tomorrow? Come out and practice with us? The coroner found upholstery fibers from gmc wagons... just like this one. I didn't mean to do it, dad. Dear god, forgive us for this. The recruiting circus has come to town, folks.</i> Today's the first day that college recruiters</i> are officially allowed to talk to the individual football players.</i> The question on everyone's mind is who will our very own</i> Smash Williams talk to first? No, you cannot. He's sleeping. No, I will not! Eh--good-bye. Lord have mercy! Georgia tech is on the phone. - Take a message. - I'm not your personal assistant. Well that's good, 'cause you not getting paid. Take this phone. Mama gettin' irritated. Smash train is pulling out the station. You better hang on before you lose your seat. Jules, honey, I made pancakes. Wanna come out for breakfast? I'm not hungry. We're gonna leave in about 20 minutes, okay? She still upset over Matt? I think so. Hi. Don't look. Where are your manners? Sorry. - I'll give you one, if you give me one. - I'm not giving anything up. What? So you want me to make some dinner? I can make some beef stroganoff. If you want to. You've done enough around here. The place looks great. I'm blown away. I don't think it's ever been this clean. - Hi. - Hi. You okay? I'm fine. You just gonna stand there? No...

I was told to see you about getting a set of keys for the activity lounge for a staff meeting of the Dillon chronicle. Sweetheart, you need to talk to your faculty advisor about that. That would be me, ma'am. - Did you just call me "ma'am?" - I did. Sorry-- Noah Barnett. English lit, creative writing, speech, and faculty advisor for the paper. You're the-- oh, good lord. How old are you, 12? Don't answer that. A lot's happened since I've been gone. I was gone having a baby. No, I don't even need to hit the ball off the tee anymore. I've graduated. My dad pitches to me now. In tee ball, when you're little you hit the ball off a tee. We're a football family, so. You know what? - Those keys will be in my office. - I'll come by later. - My office'll be great. - Thank you. - Nce to meet you. - You too. Listen up. Stop what you're doing. I want to talk to you a second. A number of you today are gonna get an opportunity to meet some recruiters. These recruiters wanna try to get you to commit to this, that, or any other school any way they can. They don't care how. But the texas high school athletic administration, they do care. I'm talking about losing state eligibility if someone gets caught accepting anything. Cell phones, concert tickets, meals, rides home. With that said, any of y'all want to meet with any particular recruiters, you talk to me or the other coaches. We work it through my office. Anything you need, you will get. Let's go have a good practice, get outta here early today. How you doing? Good to meet you. Smash Williams, how you doing, man? Pete Kinderton, Miami South. Look, I don't know about florida, man. Y'all get hurricanes-- How are you? - Good to see you. - Nice to see you too. How's owen's turf toe doing? He's good. He said he's gonna play through it. Man, that guy is tough. - You know Owen Davenport? - Yeah. - He graduated my sophomore year. - That's right. He's been starting for us for the last couple years. Guy's fantastic, yeah. I'm sorry, do you guys know each other? I've seen you around. Listen, I gotta get out of here. But I'll be here a couple days. - Gimme a shout. Take care. - Yes, sir. - Good seeing you again, Noelle. - Bye. Hey, I didn't know Owen Davenport had a little sister. He does. Well...we should hang out some time. Yeah, definitely. Okay, I'll see you in a little bit. Okay, see ya. You really gonna do this thing? I don't know. What do you think? Santiago! Come here. Listen up--here's what I want you to do. I want you to go to the guidance counselor, Mrs. Taylor, and I want you to tell her I sent you. And I want her to check your credits, and to see that you're squared away academically. - You understand what I'm saying? - Yes, sir. And be nice to her; she's my wife. - Yes, coach. - Go do that. Then we just stood there and watched as-- as the car turned into, like, a giant charcoal briquette. Then what happened? And then we just-- we went home. But that's-- that's good, right? My dad destroyed evidence. He's a cop. He can't do that. Now I've got him into this thing and... Landry, I don't know what you want me to say. I just wanted to tell you, because I don't have anyone else I can talk to about this. Yeah, I know. You been doing okay though? Yeah, I mean... about as good as I can be, I guess. Hi, y'all. Can I talk to you? I'm sorry to interrupt you. Can I talk to you for a quick second? Sorry, I'm rushing around this morning. - Sorry to interrupt you. - That's all right. Good to see you, Landry. Honey, I need to ask you a favor. I need a go-getter. And you are-- Hey, Lyla! Come here, come here. Perfect! I need two go-getters. Here's the situation. They're all on me about this whole pantherama thing. Last year, I scheduled both the entertainment and the silent auction. This year, that is a burden that I cannot bear. So what I thought would be great is to actually pass on the entertainment part of pantherama to a couple of students. What do you think? Yeah, you know, I--actually, I've been studying really hard. I would love to, but-- I've the christ teen messengers thing. Oh, honey, you are not using Jesus Christ our Lord as an excuse not to help out your counselor, are you? - No, ma'am. - That's nice, thank you. And Tyra, you too busy studying to help me out? Yeah? Oh, really? Great. Oh, I appreciate it. Y'all are gonna do a super job. I'm not kidding. I mean, I'm excited. All right, girls. Thank you so much appreciate it! Have a great day! Okay, okay, so Tracy will do the movie review, 250 words. But what we really need are feature stories. Okay, so what do you got? Anybody got any ideas? People, this is your paper, not mine. What stories do you think need telling? Well, the knife has never played anywhere in the state of texas. Good, that's-- that's interesting... if it's true. Although I don't think it merits 1,000 words. Anyone else? Julie. What about pantherama? Of course, you're pitching a football idea. I'm not pitching a football idea, okay? Pantherama's an event that's held every year by Dillon high, right? And it generates a lot of money. But where does the money go? Who decided how to distribute the money? Do all the sports get the same level of funding? I don't think so. That's exactly the kind of thinking I'm looking for. Excellent, excellent. You just talked yourself into a feature assignment. Well done. Your grades look pretty good, actually... considering you transferred... five times? My uncle's work makes him move around a lot. What about your parents? They were deported. I'm sorry. But I was born here. So did they leave you, then, in the care of your uncle? Is he your legal guardian? Well, I'm not quite clear then, why you put Garrity Motors as your address here. I just thought it would be easier, you know? Easier for what? You never know when my uncle's work is gonna have to make him move again, so. I am gonna need to have your real address. And I need to have a meeting with your uncle, just so we can sort of sit down and talk about what we-- what would happen in the coming year. Yeah, no--he-- he pulls double shifts all the time. It's really hard to pull him away... but I could have him sign whatever. If you give me something, I could have him sign it. Well you know what? It's gotta be face to face. Go to your house after school one day, - wherever's convenient for him. - It's not gonna work. How come, santiago? It's just-- it's just not gonna work. Hey, listen... is there something you'd like to tell me? My uncle hasn't been home in a while. How long is a while? 10 or 11 months. It's no big deal. It's just this car. This guy is selling a car. And I was thinking about maybe going and look at it. But it's probably too much money anyway, so. Well, matthew saracen. This is your lucky day, because I happen to be an exceptional negotiator. Oh, is that right? Did you used to work with Buddy Garrity, or something like that? No, I actually know cars. I bet I could even get you a discount. Oh, yeah? I just--I need to keep the door closed. Why's that? Because my ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend are out there. And they're-- they're pretty into pda. So I just-- I thought it would be less awkward, if I just avoided them, and I didn't have to really deal with it. And I'm sure they'll be gone in a sec, so I'll be out of your hair. That's classic, isn't it? He's the QBb1, right, and she's the cheerleader. She's, like... this perfect doll. And I'm just, like, some interlude. And she's the real deal. I guess I just... I guess I just came in to cry. You hungry? I always eat when I get dumped. That's classic. It is pretty classic. It's a veggie deluxe. I guess it couldn't hurt, right? - Thanks. - You're welcome. I can't believe you're even talking about eligibility. What's important right now is the fact that this is a boy who's an orphan. That's what you should be thinking about. I got a great idea! You know what? He joins my team, he's on my field, he's got a family. No, we get him a family, then we can talk about him being on your team. Period. End of discussion. That's just the way it's gonna have to work. So there's this girl dancin' to devil went down to georgia--she's new. And I walk up to her, and I'm all, "bitch, that's my signature song. Step off." I'll kick her ass. I dance in boots, and chaps, and a thong. - What the hell is she thinkin'? - I don't know, good costume though. - I'll tell you that much. - All I'm sayin'. - Beer? - Yeah. - Hi, y'all. - Hi, baby. Tim, could I talk to you for a second? Don't you dare screw my sister. - What are you talking about? - I swear to god, Tim. I know that you like to create havoc wherever you go. I'm serious as cancer. Do not... screw mindy. That's my line. Don't cross it. How's landry doing? You're on hour 36 of the 48, okay? Tick tock. Find a place, Tim. Let me ask you, Brian. Have you given any consideration to attending a historically black college? I'm mostly about my game, know what I'm saying? Can I get you some more coffee, Mr. Gordon? Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you. Let me cut straight to the chase, Brian. Whitmore university doesn't offer athletic scholarships, but we do offer academic ones. Should you decide to enroll at Whitmore, we'd love to have you play football for us. But regardless, you'll get a full year of education from one of the top schools in the country, guaranteed. So I could be on a team that was two and nine last season. - Say, brian. - Okay, look. Tell me this. How many players were drafted last year? - I think you know the answer to that. - Yeah, none. Look, I know you'll get other offers. Yeah, you right about that. I do understand the allure of a big football university. I just hope you'll give our college real consideration. The next four years can change your life. Mr. Gordon, college isn't the goal. It's the means to an end. I plan on going pro sooner, not later. I don't want to waste your time or mine. - You call about the dart here? - Yeah, I did. 275 horsepower? Yeah. It's not a slant six, is it? Ah, no. Smart girl, pretty girl, knows her cars. So what do you think? What are you feeling? What do you think? You're the car-- - Yeah, I think it's great. - This? You think? Absolutely, I love it. You can get a really good deal on this, trust me. Okay. So you realize you're selling to QB1 of the Dillon Panthers, right? I'll take $200 off the price. Everything that you donated will be on a silent auction table at pantherama. Great. Thank you so much. Okay, bye-bye. - Hey, listen-- - Hello, gentlemen. - How are you? - I'm good, I'm good. To what do I owe this pleasant surprise? We have been talking about this santiago situation. Look, santiago has been working for me part-time. Did you know that? He's a great worker. And when Eric told me about his living situation, I was appalled. And so, I came up with this moment of scintillating clarity. He should move in with me. Easy. Simple. Can I talk to my husband for one sec? - Absolutely. - Just one quick sec. I'll see you-- Thank you. - Why would you go and-- - Don't whisper yell at me please. Talk to him and bring him into my office? And you're suggesting that Santiago, that poor child is gonna go live with Buddy Gar-- - We're not selling puppies here. - I know we're not. This has got to go through social services. That's the protocol. It's not an ideal situation. But that's the situation. The protocol doesn't work, does it? He didn't get the assistance he needed. He fell through the cracks. And the protocol? This is not an alternative. And I know what you're doing. This is convenient for you, so that you can have your football season. Don't tell me I'm doing all this for the kid just to get him on the team. What I'm saying is yeah, he won't be living in a trailer alone. What I'm saying is yeah, he'll have family. What I'm saying is yeah, we can keep an eye on him. That's all I'm saying. This is ridiculous. How are we supposed to figure out the entertainment if we don't have a single name? We're gonna get our names. Follow me. - That's the men's-- - I know. Hey, y'all! Listen up! Quiet down. Lyla, why are we here? Because nobody signed up for pantherama. Nobody signed up for the pantherama! I know, I know. Hey, am I right to think that tradition dictates that the players provide entertainment for pantherama? Is that right? That's right. All right, listen up, ladies. Lyla and I, we have a job to do. Okay, so just make this easy on everybody. You, freshman, pass this around. What? I'm gonna be spending a lot of time with, um... - what's your name? - Carter. Yeah, Lyla and I... we're gonna be spending the whole week with Carter. Anybody else? Well done. This is good. And it's also too long. I didn't say we're not gonna run it, I just think you need to cut it down by 500 words. - Well, that's half the article. - Well, find the right half. Well, I thought you said the story's supposed to show range. "On a blustery tuesday afternoon, "one can find half a dozen multiloquous rally girls "selling raffle tickets, and to what end? Pantherama." - Multiloquous? - It just means talkative. Right. Don't use a $10 word when a nickel one will do. And I think three angry paragraphs about rally girls is kind of off point. - But I thought you said it was good. - It is, it is. It's good. But good is the enemy of great. You know, the less a reporter says, the more she hears. So, what, did you work at a newspaper too? I did. - You're just trying to prove a point. - I am. Columbia school of journalism and then a year at the city desk of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. It's a good article. Cut it down, make it great. Okay. So when Owen was being recruited, it was crazy. I was a slave. Are you stuck taking messages for Smash all the time? No. Owen played the recruiters against each other. He would listen to what UCC said, and then go back to Miami Southern and say "What are you gonna do for me?" And then he ended up with a Porsche. - For real? - So, your brother likes Miami Southern. Oh, yeah. He's, like, the king of that place. Are your parents happy with his education? I guess, sure. My dad says the connection he makes on the team will serve him better than a Masters. Your mother must be concerned about him getting hurt. You know there are no guarantees in football. Guys like Smash are blessed. That's as close as you get to a guarantee. Amen. You got that right. He's here. Oh, my Lord, Matthew! - Is this it? - This is it. - It's old. - It's a classic. - That's what the owner told me. - Let's just check out the engine. That is not bad for this age of a car. - No, these engines, they run forever. - Yeah, clearly. I wanna go on a ride. Y'all move back. Will you take us? - You want to go for a ride? - I want to go for a ride! Grandma wants to go for a ride. Let's all get in the car, go for a ride. - Oh it's nice. - You know how to drive? I'm a good driver. I'll be the judge of that. - You good? - I'm ready. Here we go. I know what you gonna say. Shoulda told you ahead of time that I invited a friend for dinner. That wasn't even what I was gonna say. I was wondering if you had taken any thought to what Mr Gordon said about Whitmore. Mom, were you listening to anything Noelle was saying? Her brother worked it. I ain't going to no tired school when I got recruiters from Florida, Texas, and California on the line. What does that mean, "working it?" - I'm gonna look for the best situation. - What has gotten into you, Brian? You were rude to Mr Gordon. That man offered you a full scholarship. And then you waltz in here with this white girl and act like she a prophet. - Is that what this is about? - No, you tell me what it's about! 'Cause it's not even like that. I wanna know is-- Is this what you think it's about? Is this why you play football? You have no idea how any of this works. Noelle's seen the whole thing before. You haven't. You just want me to nod and smile and say "yes, Mr Gordon" like a good boy. - He can't give me what I want. - I want you to use your brain and think! And what if you end up like Jason Street? Oh, he had the whole world. He had everything until he got hurt. That's not ever gonna happen to me. That's what I'm saying. I'm going all the way, all the way, and all you can think about is how I might fail? How I might not make it? No, no, I won't let you. Nobody's holding me back. Not you, not anybody! What part of "get into a straight line" don't y'all understand? Come on, guys, let's go! Come on! Let's go, let's go! Come on, - get up. Get up. - You guys volunteered, right? Let's just get in a couple straight lines. Let's try and figure this thing out. It's gonna be really simple. It's just a walk. Just do what I do. Five, six, seven, eight. D.H.S.-- It's supposed to be funny. All right, all right, take a break. Five minute break. We're not done. Just take a break. Any bright ideas, because I don't think that - the cheering thing is gonna work. - No. Hey, hey you. Put your shirt back on. Oh, you got called out, man. All right. Take it off again. Now see that? That is entertainment. Put a little music to some moves. You can choreograph, right? If we're gonna do it, let's make it fun, you know? That is what I'm talking about. All right, guys. Okay, I get it, I get it. I get it. Let's get in a straight line. Okay, so that's pathetic. I mean, how much vomit? Don't laugh when somebody confesses something embarrassing. - Hey. - Hey, y'all. Hey, mom. Hi. - Right on, keys. - I brought Mr Barnett his keys. By the way, that whole story's off the record. Incidentally, your daughter has a feature in the Dillon Chronicle tomorrow. How about that? Good for you, sweetie. - Thank you. - That's great. I'll see you later, mr. B. Adios. Everything okay in here? Yeah, everything's good. - Good. - Thanks for the keys. - Appreciate it. - Let me know if you need anything. Julie. Under over. Snapping. - Nice moves! - No, it's not-- Shut up. No, it's just this thing that I gotta do tomorrow for Pantherama. What's that? It's that thing that you gotta take my grandma to tomorrow night. Lyla and Tyra made up this stupid dance. And they think I need to be up in the front row. And then, I think we even gotta take our shirts off. Oh, like the Full Monty? No, not like the Full Monty, but it's pretty bad. I'm not even gonna do it. I'm just gonna tell 'em I'm sick. I have to stay home and take care of my grandma. - No! - Yeah. No, if you're going to dance in front of people, you have to own it. - It's stupid. Everyone's gonna laugh. - So? - Okay, show me the dance. - No. I'll help. I love dancing. Come on. Whatever, fine. Here, watch. It's like this. It's like, it's like... Okay, okay, that's good. But loosen up! It's loose, it's loose. 'Cause if you don't move your shoulders, you look like a robot. - But you have to move your hips. - But what about the shoulders? This is how you do it. You march. And then hips just side to side. Do this. Put your hands on my hips, go. Like this, side to side. All right. See? - You feel it? - Yeah, I feel it. It's good, it's fun. I mean, yeah. So do it again. That's good! Look at those hips! It's not good. It's good. - I got you all wet. - That's okay. I'm officially telling Whitmore no. What? I'm going pro, mama. I won't need to finish four years, 'cause when I turn 21, I'll be signing with the NFL. I'm going pro and I'm gonna need to be around people who believe that. I'm thinking big picture for this family. So I'll be going to my future recruiting meetings alone. I'm not mad. I just... I'm gonna do what I need to do. Is this because of that girl? No. I told you it's not like that. This is me. I have been thinking about this Santiago situation. And I did a little research into him. Into his background, and kid has been in juvie twice. And he's had some violent episodes. Now what concerns me about putting a boy like that back into the foster care system is that there's just a great risk there. Especially if he gets into one of those group homes... - I understand. - I mean, I know that you're looking at him like he's a great football player. But I want to make something clear to you. This is a boy who needs a home. - And this is a boy who's at risk. - I know, Tami. I mean, I've got three kids. I know what it takes. But this is not a kid like your three kids. This is a whole different situation. It's true. Even though I'm a little bit nervous about it, I know I can do this. And... I really like the kid. I think he's got a great heart. I want him to have a chance. I do too. Morning, sunshine. - Can't believe you just did that. - This coming from the guy who shows up on my porch expecting a sleepover. - Seriously, Tim, I want you gone. - Do you want some breakfast, Tim? - Sounds great. - Shut up! No, he's leaving. He's leaving. I can't deal with you here, Tim. I want you gone. I'm serious. I don't have anywhere to go, Tyra. Oh, right, because your brother's sleeping with the girl that you used to, - screw around with? That old lady. - Good morning, Timmy. - Good morning, Min. - I know a guy that's always looking for people to help him with his pets. - I'll give you his number. - See? There you go. As good as that sounds, I may have to check that out. Today... - Hey, sweetheart, how's your day going? - Fine till I read this. You read this? "Pantherama: Where does the money go?" By Julie Taylor. I know. She's been working really hard on that with that Mr Barnett. - Have you met that new teacher? - "Athletic director and Panther's coach had no comment." She asked me through the bathroom door. I was busy. Sweetheart... She does make some good points in there. Bye, honey! Ms. Williams? - How are you? Have a seat. - I'm all right. I need to know what y'all gonna do about this recruitment insanity. My phone is ringing off the hook day and night. My kid is acting like he needs a hollywood agent. Now you told the parents you were gonna keep an eye on this. It gets pretty heated up around here this time of year. Now wait a second. These recruiters are pretty aggressive. I gotta tell you something. When they see your boy, they see a prize. I mean, he's got the talent. All I can hear about is how fast he can go pro. Not one word about his education. - Not one. - I can give recommendations. I can give advice. But in the long run, that's a decision that Brian's gonna be making, or Brian and yourself. My dead husband was a triflin' man. I couldn't count on him to bring his check home, or to be faithful. But he was always there for Brian. They could talk. Now I'm not asking you to be this boy's daddy. I'm just here to remind you he doesn't have one. - There's gonna be a great show tonight. - Ooh, good! Carlotta helped with it. - She did? - Yeah, she's quite the choreographer. What kind of show, Matthew? - Kind of a variety show, I guess. - Good. Do you realize that Pantherama's the first social event that Gracie's ever been to in her entire life? You really should start saving up for therapy right now. Pantherama is tradition, and tradition is good, sweetheart. Maybe you could use some of that positive tradition in the work you're doing with your articles. Noah says you can't have preconceptions - about an article. - I don't care what he says. - Does everybody call him noah? - Mom, that's his name. I would think it would be Mr Barnett. As far as me impinging on your freedom of the press, how about you come out with a little more balance, more fairness. What do you think about that? Welcome everybody to Pantherama! I want to thank you for coming out supporting your Dillon panthers! Is everybody having a good time? You guys, listen up. I'll be over here on the side. If you get out of line or you need me, I'll be right here. Don't screw up. Let's do it. You guys are gonna be great. Ready? All right. Ladies and gentlemen, a big round of applause for your Dillon Panthers! Did you like that? I always said you had great feet. You know - how to move. - Thank you, grandma. And you got that from me. I told coach that I'd stay and help and clean up. Well, that's nice. So I'll be back in a little bit, all right. All right. Here's the keys. Okay, I'll take it from here. You looked good out there. 'Cause of you. I'll see you at the house. You know, I think we can finish those bulbs today. Wouldn't that be great? Next spring it would be so beautiful. - Good morning, honey. - Morning. Everything looks so good. This is a good breakfast. I was thinking about some iris, 'cause we've got day lilies back there. Y'all probably don't know, but they look alike. - Thank you. - You're welcome. We need some bone meal. Matthew, can you help me remember that? Bone meal. We might need some more bulbs. I don't think I've got that many. The lady next door said she'd give me some of hers. You can thin 'em out. And that's really a pretty good way to do it. Just transplant 'em, you know? Which might be better than bulbs when you get down it. 'Cause you've already got 'em started. we're not talking about a studio apartment here. - We're talking 3 bedrooms, 2 baths-- - How you doing? - Coach, how you doing? - I'm doing fine. - Good to see you. - You too. I make sure you aren't picking up any of Brian's tab. Of course, that'd be against athletic admin rules, wouldn't it? Yes, it would. We don't break rules at Miami Southern. Even if you were gonna buy one of his tall tale that he's prone to tell, that could screw up my season. - It be a damn shame for you. - Yeah, it sure would, pete. Well listen, smash, thanks for the time. Let's do this again. You got my card. Coach, always a pleasure. - What the hell are you doing? - Okay, fine. I didn't set up this meeting through your office. I set it up myself. Nobody wants all that red tape, coach. And I don't need you to hold my hand. I'm grown. I'm looking at all my options. I'm trying to make the best decision for my future. You got heart... charisma... and a lot of skill. You're probably one of the best athletes I have ever coached. Thank you. My old man gave me a hard time, every damn decision I ever made. Every single day I lived under the roof of that man, we went head to head. I'm here. I just wanted to remind you of that. You got money? Good. You buy your own meal. - Thanks now. - Sure thing, Coach. - Who the hell are you? - Name's Tim Riggins. What do you want? Mindy Colette called you and said I was coming by. Oh, damn, you're that football guy, huh? Sorta, yeah. So you need a place to crash. So long as you help take care of Roscoe and Coltrane, you're welcome. - Who's that? - My ferrets. Ferrets better than cats. Come on in. I'll introduce you. Come, football boy. Hey! Hi. So I was wondering about my next assignment. A glutton for punishment. When you worked at the paper, how did you keep coming up with good ideas? How do you know they were good ideas? I subscribe to the New York Times. I read it every day, cover to cover. You should start by doing that. We can share this one And start to get a sense of what makes a good story. Um, well, thank you. Good. Glad I could help. I'll see you tomorrow. This is good. This'll be masculine-lookin'. Great, uh, hey, babe. You wanna take these and maybe you and Santiago can start making up the bed - and setting up your room. - Come on. Buddy. Come here. I want to see what you got in the refrigerator, I need to see what you've got prepared. - Got everything we need. - You got a lot of steak, And a lot of sausage. Get some vegetables in here. You're a guardian now. You get me? You gotta be home when he's home. He's a kid. - All right? - All right. Why don't you go on in? Make him feel comfortable, make him feel at home. Okay, all right. This is the last time I'm ever gonna be making your bed. - Good? - Yeah. Absolutely. So this is it. It's not very roomy, but, uh-- And this was Buddy Junior's desk. It's small. I'll try to get you a bigger. But you can work there for now. I think I'm doing the right thing. You're doing the right thing. Got your bathroom, and this is your bed. Two beds. I wish it was roomier, Santiago, but when I moved in, I really, to tell you the truth, didn't think it was gonna be that long. So, but... This is the... first real bed I ever had. Well...
