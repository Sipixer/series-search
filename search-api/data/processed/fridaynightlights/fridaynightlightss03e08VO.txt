- We're gonna turn a major profit. - We'll see what happens{\, OK?}. I love you. The girl that came here, her name is Ally Darcy. I hooked up with her five years ago. There's no way that kid's mine. - You're not lying{\ to me}? - I'll never lie to you. This is my man, right here, my soon-to-be agent, Grant Halbert. All you gotta do is sign{\, baby. Jason, nice meeting you}. If you're in the Big Apple, ring me up. You get your head in this game... - Joe, I need my quarterback. - I'm talking to my boy. {\All I'm asking is you to }Give the kid some room to breathe, so I can work with him. - {\It's a }Job well done, fellas! - {\All right. So }What's next? - Do we call that realtor lady? - No, we sell the house ourselves. - We got an offer on the house. - You're kidding me? Are you serious? - I love this life. - You can't. That's not a cheers. - You're just thinking out loud. - I {\can }do what I wanna do. How about this? To... - money! - No, wait! To being bad-ass real estate guys who just... - To money! - To money! - What are we gonna do with that money? - {\Dude,}I'm calling Mindy up{\ on the phone} and {\I'm }telling her, "{\Sweetie, }You don't ever have to shake your ass at the Landing Strip again." {\No, }I'm thinking about one or two things{\, maybe}. Either open up an orphanage, or B, I'm gonna go ahead and see how many margaritas I can buy with 14 grand. - I'm in for the latter. - I'd like to see your orphanage. Six, you're up, go. Me, I'm gonna take a little trip to New York and get a job in a sports agency with my friend Grant that I met and... Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. Who the hell is Grant? He's a guy I met once. So you're just gonna get up and move to New York? {\Well, }Not New York, New Jersey. I'm gonna live in New Jersey with Noah and Erin, and then I'm gonna... commute into New York for my fancy sports agent job. Why would you wanna leave Texas? 'Cause it's not about Texas anymore, it's about Erin and Noah. OK, when do we leave, Six? - I can't believe it. - Isn't it great? Now listen. Did I tell you? It's gonna go on the market in 3 days, which means this baby's gonna sell. Now, everyone is gonna want this house. So we gotta move fast. I can't believe it. It's just... This is perfect. It's everything that Eric and I have been talking about for so many years. It's like my dream house. I{\'m gonna} call the realtor, tell her we're gonna make an offer. No, I don't think we should do that quite yet. - I need to, you know... - It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Tami, it's a foreclosure. {\I know, }It{\ does} seems like it's a good price, but it's still... For us, it's probably a little bit of a stretch, you know, financially. OK, look at it. You deserve this. Really, you really, really do. And you can sell your house, you'd have that income. And you're the principal{\, for crying out loud}! He's the head coach. You can do this. You can. I don't know that he's gonna look at it that way necessarily. So I have to leave for six months. I'm gonna be by myself, on the road, every night, and possibly come back with a broken outcome. You know, last time I checked, you're a cowboy, that's your job, am I right? Yeah, I guess you're right. You sure you can't come? I'd love to, but I have this little thing called school. Just for{\, like,} a couple of days. You can't come for a couple of days? I have a college interview. It's this week. Well, then you can't come. That's important. But I will... be thinking about you every day, and... we'll talk all the time on the phone, and... you'll be back soon. Right? Yeah, I'll be back. 92 coming in, there he is! This is for our win last week, gentlemen. If effort equals success, we shouldn't have won that game. Act like you've done this before, let's go! No, we've been doing this all year, let's go. There he is. Drop it! - Let's go. - Lead him in! Jesus! You gotta catch that if it's in your hand! There he is. Man, man, man! Hit him inside. Are you serious? Jamarcus, what the hell are you doing? - I'm running my route. - You're supposed to run a post. - You know what a post is? - {\Man, }He threw it to me wrong. - Coach, can I show him what a post is? - Go ahead. Ain't anything worse than what we've got out there now. Jamarcus, shut up. Blue, 8, 10! Run it out, let's go! That's the way. Yes! We're back to 22. How come our quarterback's running routes better than our receivers, huh? That's the way... Brian, step up there. Call 911! 3x08: NEW YORK, NEW YORK Subtitles: Team Panthers With benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, GillesSilb, Ju, loky34, ouazo, tactactac So, what's the plan? Six, go! The plan is to get a suit and then I go see Grant. That's the same plan we had the whole way up here. Oh, man, a suit. Excuse me, sir. Sorry to bother you. Can you just let me know where you got that suit? Paul Stuart. We need to find a Paul Stuart. Get the hands off my cab, jackass. You know where Paul Stuart's is? OK, what? - Worth it. - Worth it. Paul Stuart. Let's get you suited up, Six! Right here. Do you smell that? That's success. It's right here. Right there. Right there! - That's the one. - You think so? Look at this. How're you doing? {\- It is nice.} - May I help you? - What's the damage on this garb? This is woolen cashmere imported from London. It's $1884. - Six! - This is it? Two for $125. - That works. - You want dark or... blue? Like, I don't know... This isn't bad, it feels nice. I mean, I don't know... - {\What do you think, }You wanna try this on? - What if she says no, Riggs? What do you mean? Who says no? Erin. What if Erin says no... What if we buy these suits, and I go and I get a job or don't get a job, and I show up at her doorstep, and I ask her to take me back, and she says no? I don't know, man. You can play that "what if" game all day. I believe you're doing the right thing. I just gotta make it so she doesn't say no. - Suits, job... - How're you doing{\, guys}? How're you doing, sir? We need two suits. Well, I've got two for $125, and then I've got an extra package, $200. - What's the package? - {\Well }You're gonna get two suits, right? Then you're gonna get two shirts, two ties, two socks, and a free pair of shoes, for $200. Shive. What do you think? No, I just want to get back out on the field, that's all I wanna do. - Two weeks for practice, - Just relax! - Two weeks to playoffs. - You know what? We're gonna be fine. We'll be fine, we'll work it out. Take care of yourself, all right? All right, thanks. - Tell the guys hello. - I will. Get a drink of water with your little flexi-straw. All right, see you later, buddy. OK, so... Back to business. Here's the deal. We gotta get a coach to replace him and I've been thinking maybe Wade Aikmen would be a good choice. What are you talking about, Wade Aikmen? I'm just speaking on behalf of the boosters. When you say boosters, you're talking about Joe McCoy. - I don't wanna talk about that crap{\right now}. - No, I understand that. I don't wanna talk about smiling Joe either. This is not about him. This is about Wade Aikmen being a perfect fit at this moment. He's the kid's personal quarterback coach, he knows the kid, he's been working with him{\the kid}, he knows our spread offense. He's young, he's energetic, he can pick this up, - and we can still... - {\You know what? }Do me a favor, would you? You tell the boosters that I'll handle this my way. Always. I'm excited about Western for you. They actually hold a side opening specifically for kids just like you, who didn't necessarily have the best GPA's at the beginning but have pulled them up. You're not being given anything. There's no hand-out here. This is {\just}about you and your hard work. {\And I think }It's gonna be a perfect match for you. I feel good, and I feel focused, and... I'm ready, I'm ready for this. I'm proud of you. Proud of you. Proud of you for staying focused. You've worked hard, gone against a lot of odds. I'm proud of you. Thank you. Coach. Here's those... Tennessee charts. Good, Matt. Thanks. - Hey, how's... - Julie! How's Coach McGill doing? He's doing good. I'll tell him you say hello. Thanks. Coach... - Julie! What do you think about the idea of... me maybe moving over to receiver. I mean, I know all the routes. And I just kind of think I probably would be - a bigger help to the team... - Matt, you get yourself injured... J.D. gets himself injured, I'm out of a quarterback, I'm screwed. Are you ready to go? - Where're you going? - We're gonna go hang out.{\You'll be back for dinner?} - Got your cell phone? Have a good time. - Yes, I have my cell phone. See you later, Coach. I'm here to see... Mr. Grant Halbert. - What is your name? - Jason Street. Do you have an appointment, Mr. Street? No, ma'am. I don't. OK, {\well, }if you'd like to call back and make an appointment. I don't have an appointment but I... I do know that when I met Mr. Halbert in Texas just a little while ago, he told me specifically to come see him when I came to New York and that's why I'm here now. I'm sure if you just let him know Jason Street... would like to see him, I'm sure he'd love to have me. Just Jason Street, just... Please. There's a Mr. Jason Street here. - I'm Wendell Foley's friend from Texas. - He's Wendell's friend from Texas. There you go. Hey, Jason. - Hey, Mr. Halbert. - What are you doing here? I just... You said to come see you when I was in New York... I'm here now, so... I figured I'd stop by. All right... Let's go back in the office and talk a little bit. I will be right here. Thank you so much for your help, ma'am. So I understand we only met once, sir, but... I've been thinking a lot about what you said about being a sports agent, and how... - it's the next best thing to playing...{\and I would love to...} - Jackson! Stop, son. - It's Jason, sir. - Quit doing this to yourself. I can start at the bottom, there's really... It's not a problem, I can work my way up. You're living in a dream world, brother. This is the big time, it's New York city. It's not Dillon where you {\go }get a job at a car dealership just because you know all the boosters. Do you have any idea who applies for the entry level positions? - No, sir. - They're Harvard graduates. I'm not kidding you about that. It was a miracle I got my ass in here. And it's gonna be a miracle if I get to stay. Your buddy Wendell? He screwed me over. He told he was going to sign with me. And then he goes out and gets courted by SCI, who's the biggest, glossiest sports talent agency in this city. Didn't even call me. Son, the only reason I let you into this office today is because I was looking for {\some }information about Wendell that would help me out. That's it. - Well, thank you for your time. - Welcome to New York City, son. Just eat one more bite, sweetheart. One more... Oh, honey pie... I gotta tell you, Buddy just pisses me off. Getting Wade out there for Joe McCoy, that's just... I don't get it, and it pisses me off. I know but you know what? Here's one thing you might want to think about. You are gonna need a replacement for Mac. And you know, Wade is good with J.D., and you're gonna need J.D. to be good in order to get in the playoffs. One more bite... - Well, thank you very much. - Well, I'm just saying you're going to have to replace Mac and it might be the lesser of two evils. 'Cause you know he'd be a good replacement. - That's my sweet girl. - Maybe I ought to hire you. Thank you, that'd be good. Honey, that looks delicious, thank you. Well, you know, I actually wanted to talk to you about something. Because I went and saw this house the day before yesterday that's about to go on the market... and I have to tell you, honey, I know we have not talked about this in a long time, but this house... I walked in, and I thought, "This is our future." You would have a place for an office, we'd have a yard for Gracie Belle. - I {\just }thought to myself, this could be{\ the perfect}... - Did you find this house by yourself? No, I went with Katie McCoy. Yeah, 'cause you know, she{\does a little...,} dabbles in a little - real estate and she heard about it. - She heard about that? Honey... - I'm just asking. - {\Well, }I'm just telling you about this house because I was {\really }excited about it and I'd love for you to go look at it with me{\this week}. We need to kind of go soon 'cause it's gonna go on the market and it's gonna go like that. Please? Please? Hon? I cannot believe that I actually went into Grant's office and expected him to give me a job. I'm an idiot in a wheelchair, which is the {\only }reason he{\ even} let me in that office because he remembered the wheelchair. That's all everybody remembers me for{\, man}. - The wheelchair. - {\OK, }You know what? Drop the violin, Six. OK, let's take a beat, here. Where are we right now? Where are we? - Time Square. - Time Square, Big Apple. Taking a big bite out of it. You know what else we got? We got Gypsy tonight. - There's strippers in it. - I don't wanna see Gypsy. - What do you mean{\ you don't wanna see Gipsy}? - My life's falling apart around me{\, Riggins}, OK? Last thing I wanna do is go see a Broadway show for 3 hours with you. "You feel that you're watching a woman who has peeled down - to her unadorned id." - Riggs! - What? - I'm sorry but it's not working. I appreciate the fact you're trying to cheer me up, but it's not gonna work. The only thing that'll{\s gonna} cheer me up is having my boy in my arms, and it doesn't look like it's gonna happen any time soon. You know what? You want your boy in your arms? Go... Go grab Wendell, bring him back to that agency, make him sign there. 'Cause {\you know what? }you're the only person that's gonna be able to do that. You know what you'll get out of it? A job {\that }they won't be able to deny you. And some leverage. And that's all you need, right now. So, wait, you want me to go down to Penn A&M and convince Wendell that he's making a mistake, 'cause... I mean, he is making a mistake, he's making a huge mistake. That's brilliant, Riggs! - Do it! - So guess what we're doing tomorrow? Right after Gypsy tonight, then. Good practice, good hustle. - You ready, bud? - I don't think we're gonna practice{\, today}. - What? Are you joking? - I{\'m gonna} take you get something to eat. {\Go get changed.} - I'm not. Go! I'm serious. - Really? - All right. - I'll be here waiting on you. Do me a favor, would you? Be easy on him. Give him some rest, right now. Yeah, I just told him that. I'm gonna take him to Applebee's. Listen... I bring you out here as assistant coach, what do you think about that? Mind you, it'd be temporary. I'm talking about just until Mac gets back. - So we're clear. - Sure. If that were to happen, J.D. can have {\absolutely }no special treatment out here. - We can agree on that? - I think we agree on that. - Work over {\the rest of }the details later? - Sounds good to me. I'll see you out here tomorrow. Does your dad, like... - not like me anymore? - Why would you say that? {\I don't know.} It seems like ever since I got mad about him benching me, he's been mad at me, like he's holding a grudge{\ or something}. Is this about the whole him not letting you play wide receiver thing? Kinda. My dad's really stubborn, sometimes. You just... {\You really just }need to work on him. - Be persistent about it. - Really? Yeah. I mean, it works for me. Doesn't that get annoying? I'm just really proud of you, really impressed you're gonna do this{\ thing}, even though Cash is leaving. I'm... I'm gonna miss that boy around here. Mama, he's coming back. Baby! He's a cowboy. He's gonna do the rodeo circuit. He's gonna have about fifty women a day, in their... tight, painted-on-their-ass jeans throwing themselves at him. Well, Cash isn't like that, so... I'm not worried. It's... He's a cowboy. Tyra Collette? - Come on in. - {\I actually... }I need to take this real quick. - Do you mind? - No, sure. Go ahead. - Thank you. - All right. Hey, baby girl. Hey. I've been trying to reach you all day. I know, sorry{\, baby}. I've been packing up all day, but I was gonna call you and... {\wanted to }tell you {\how much }I was gonna miss you. Me too. Can I... - Can I ask you something? - You should know that by now, you can ask me anything. Are you gonna be faithful to me? Come on{\, Tyra}. Am I gonna be faithful to you? What kind of question is that? Damn.{\ All right, look,} I'm just gonna be honest with you{\baby} 'cause I love you.</i> Being on the road is hard. It's real hard. I'm gonna be gone, like, six months. A lot of long and cold nights, I'm gonna be by myself. I mean... I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try my best to be faithful to you 'cause I love you. I gotta go. I have my interview. All right, good luck. - I'm Tyra Collette. - Laura Davidson. Have a seat. So let's just start with you telling me a little bit about yourself. Well, I'm from Dillon, I'm 17, and I would love... to go to college. Have you heard from Mrs. Davidson? I did, I did, and... you know, I think it went fine. We won't know anything definitive until after the winter break anyway, so I think you should continue with all your applications, you know, give yourself a lot of options. And this interview experience, it's a learning experience, so keep going with the interview process... But I think you're on the right track, so I'm proud of you. Well, OK. All right. All right. Good job, there you go. 16, come on. Come on, 29. Pump it. Let's go, here we go! Hit that one! Good job, 82! Come on, 16. Come on! Come on, 16, get back in line. Good job. Get over here. 13, 29, step up. Now watch... Ready, 13? How's that front block drill going? {\It's going }Good. We're gonna do receiver{\, right now}. I learned some stuff at a coaching clinic at USC, and they seem to like it. What's Matt doing {\over }here? You realize he gets hurt and J.D.'s not available, - I'm {\pretty much }stuck with seventh graders. - I know, Coach. I'm playing him wide, he's not gonna get hurt. I won't let him get hit. {\I tell you what. }This isn't USC, so let's stick to the drills we talked about. Let's get him back to quarterback. What do you say? Matt, get that jersey back on! Saracen, get back over there, now. Hey, Coach. How're you doing? Listen, I heard you hired Wade, and I just wanted to say that... I'm glad you decided to set aside our differences and... do what's best for the team. - Good. - Good. - You have a good night. - You too, bud. I think it's, like, four bathrooms. Isn't that crazy? It's pretty great, right? I just love this kitchen. And the backyard! Look at that backyard, honey! And that grill! Can't you just see little Gracie Belle playing back there, you throwing the ball with Jules... Is that our Julie, or is there gonna be another? You know what I mean. We can have parties, we can have the barbecue, we can have the football party back here... You know... Come here. Talk to me. We cannot afford this. Well, I mean, I know it's a stretch. Babe, we can't afford it. Before you say that, - can we at least have a conversation? - We are having a conversation. I know, but I think we need to sit down with our finances. - This could be a great investment. - Our mortgage would double. Hon, I know, but the point that I'm making is that I feel like we are expanding. I think that we actually could do it. Listen. What happens if I lose my job? Think about that. - You're gonna win the playoffs. - What happens if you lose your job? - Why would you say that? - Because you could lose your job. I could lose my job. - That is the most pessimistic way{\ to think}... - {\Honey, }I'm not being pessimistic, I'm being realistic. We cannot afford this. I'm trying to think about our lives and not think about it in terms of gloom and doom, and OK, we gotta stay put in one place our whole lives. {\You know, }This is our dream house. - That's what we need to {\be }think{\ing} about. - You know what you just said? "Our.{\ Our.}" That means the two of us. As far as my side is concerned, I say no. - Don't just say no. - You want me to just say yes? No! But don't just say no, without us having a conversation about it. Where are you going? - Me? I'm gonna go outside. - You're just gonna walk out? I'm just going out to get some fresh air, sweetie. Sorry. There it is, Asbury Hall. That's where they said Wendell's dorm is. I sure hope he's here, 'cause if he's not, we're gonna have to sit on the doorstep till he shows up. {\You know, }If this actually goes through... when it actually all goes through, you're gonna have to live here... for, like... for good. Yeah, that's the plan. It is. Why? Does it bother you a little bit? I'll be back to visit{\, man}. It's not like I'm not gonna be back in Dillon at all. All right, well... I'm going in there alone. I'm gonna talk to him. Stay out here and don't get in trouble. - All right. - I'll go get this guy. - No regrets. - See you in a few. Heard you're not going to sign with Grant anymore? Man, I think that's cool... if that's really what you wanna do, if you've really thought about it, if you really see the big picture here, but I don't think you do. What're you talking about? I don't think you see the fact that this bigger agency, you're just another athlete on paper to them. You're just another paycheck to them. They're gonna collect as many of you as they can to get another BMW in their garage. That's what you are to them. You need someone who's young, someone who's smart, someone who's ambitious, {\someone }who's gonna put all their attention on you, all their passion into you, and all their drive behind making you, because making you is gonna make them. That's what you need. - And... Grant is that person? - I think so. You're gonna be his present, {\You're gonna be }his future. You're gonna be his kids' college fund. You'll{\re gonna} be the reason he's able to put dinner on his family's table every night and he's gonna work harder for you because of that, because of his family. Because when success is essential to keeping your family together, there's nothing a man will not do. OK? All I'm saying is, give him a shot. Go and talk to him, he can get the job done. He's been trying to get ahold of you, and you've been ignoring him. Jason, what would you get out of this, dude? I want Grant to give me a job. But I also want to see you succeed. So on my way back home, I figured I'd come down here and tell you you're making a mistake. I could've just... gone back to Dillon and said, I didn't get a job in the city, and... Wendell's making a mistake, and I{\ really} hope he makes it, and just left it at that. I could've done that, but... You know me. I'm not the type of guy who just leaves things at that. There's no one else like you, man. I'm counting on that. You couldn't even wait till my body got cold before you replaced me. With the playoffs coming up, I gotta have some help{\ somehow}. I'm not replacing you. Wade Aikmen? - He's Joe McCoy's boy, you know that. - Everything's understood. Until you come back, he's interim. You got a fox in the henhouse, that's what you got yourself. - Well, we'll see about that. - You know what that means, don't you? I have Wendell Foley and Jason Street here for you. Guys? Mr Halbert. - What's going on? - What's happening? - You're here to talk? - Well... My boy Jason brought me. You can thank him for that. {\If }You think I'll let you leave this office without {\you }coming back to me{\, man}, you're crazy. Come on back, let's talk a little bit. Jason, come sit in the meeting with us. I need you in here. - {\Miss Taylor, }It's a really good chicken. - Good, I'm glad you're enjoying it. Nice to be complimented on the food that you've slaved over after a long day at work. I said it was a very nice meal too{\, honey}. - It is a good meal. - Thank you, honey. Dad, why don't you let Matt play at wide receiver this year? We don't talk football at the dinner table. We talk about football at breakfast, lunch, and the dinner table. - Sweetie{\heart}, it's none of your business. - Drop it, just drop... We're just a family having dinner, talking about work, right? I'm just saying, he deserves it. He's worked hard for the Panthers, it's his senior year, he knows all the routes... He thinks like a QB, you should at least give him a shot. All I'm asking is you give him a shot. I'll tell you what, why don't we talk about the house we can't afford?{\ Why don't you run with that one?} I do know the routes just as well as anybody else, Coach. I do, I'll prove it to you too, we can go outside and... Call ten... call ten routes, I'll run 'em all, I miss one, I'll shut up about this, you won't hear another word about it. You miss one, we never discuss it again. You make 'em all, I'll think about it{\, that's it}. Is that what you're saying? - Yeah. - All right, let's go. Well, y'all, let's finish dinner first! Slant. You're ready? Set, hut! All right! - Come on! Hurry up!{\ Let's go!} - One for one! How about a curl? - Slide, slide. - Yes, sir. - Set, hut! Skinny post. Set, hut! Go Matt! That was a good one! Run a slide. Try using you hands instead of your chest! Ready? Set, hut! Six out of six! Out and up, that's right, I know what I'm saying. Hut! That's good? Yeah, you look a little slow though. - Your legs getting tired? - {\No, }They're good. - You{\'ve been} stretched 'em out? - I {\just }haven't been using them much lately{\ on the bench}. You{\'ve} been sitting on the bench too long, that's what you were gonna say? Out and up, set, hut! Nine per nine, one more! - I'm getting nervous! - It's nine out of nine. - I understand, I can count. - I mean, {\it's just }one more and we're good. - Pick your legs up this time. - Yes, sir. Set, hut! Come on. That was a piss-poor pass. I'll think about it. Let's go eat. It's cold now. - Have we got aspirin in the house? - Sure we do. Your arm? You haven't thrown like that in years. - He'll think about it... - So me being you girlfriend, does that entitle me to 10% of all your future earnings? I think it should! We should start like a contract or something right now. - What's all this? - I'm going with you. Really? Oh, my god! What about school? What about it? Let's go! - Before I change my mind. - Let's go then, let's go! - You're sure about this? - Yeah, let's go. OK, let's go. - God! Come on now! - Honey... I can't stop thinking about the house. - What? - I can't stop thinking about the house. And I just don't like the way we've gone into it and I probably handled it wrong but... I just feel like this is something that we need to do together, and it's an opportunity for us as a couple and as a family... Can we just do... Can we do something together? Can we just go back and look at that house one more time? And say that we're going back there... as partners, and look at it together, and think about it together. Think about what we want for our family and... what we want for our lives, for our finances and all that, together. - Can I turn the light off? - I'll set it up... - Can I turn the light off? - Yeah, go ahead. - So this is all original woodwork, - I know... and granite tops, they last for a lifetime. Right? And have you seen the view from the master? And I checked with the owner, yes, the appliances are all included in the house. - I know you had mentioned that{\, which is worth}... - You're {\so }lucky to be{\ good} friends with Katie, you are the first people to have the opportunity{\ to look at this house}... Could you give us a second just to talk this over? - Absolutely! - Just a little breathing room... No problem, my pleasure, I'll just be right outside. Thank you. God, she talks a lot! I know, don't let her turn you off to the whole thing. Pretty great, right? Honey, as much as I would love... love... to give this to you, and to the kids, and to myself, it's a beautiful house, no doubt about it. We cannot do this. It is a lot! If we ended up getting this, I would go crazy, I would not sleep at night. Financially? We cannot do this. I am sorry. I don't need this house. I don't. I got you and I got Jules, and I got Gracie Belle, and I got the best life. And I don't need this house. But I appreciate your coming and looking, and being honest with me{\, and}... That was all I cared about, just... Whatever we do, we're doing it together. I love you, baby. I love you too. - Oh, God... - Excuse me. You know, I have the sweetest little... three-bedroom, it's so cozy... Listen you have been so sweet, but I think we are officially not really in the market right now. So thank you for all your time. Thank you very much, thanks for showing us. I appreciate it. Thanks for giving us your time. So I got this job, and I... I need to find a place to live, and I'd prefer for that to be with you, and Noah... if you'll have me. No, that sounds... terrible. If, er... I'd prefer for that to be with you and Noah if... If that's OK... with you... Jason, I'm pregnant. - What? - I was being... - your gal. - God, Riggs! What if she throws you a curve ball like that{\, what are you gonna say}? What, like she's pregnant? I could roll with that. Good job! {\Now, }Buddy already knows this, but when Wade, there, was throwing the rock for Tech, he was runner-up for the Heisman two years in a row. Let's do that again! Matt! Go in for Kendell for wide receiver. Let's go! J.D., give him something to work with. - Make them work for their money{\, let's go}! - Blue, 80! Blue, 80! Set! Come on, come on! That's what I was talking about, Wade! Rock and roll, baby! That's it right there! It's a nice neighborhood, man. You got it? Yeah. Hey, J-6... I hope you get everything... I hope you get everything you want. But no matter what happens in there, you're... you're always gonna be my best friend. And you deserve to be happy. Thank you. Texas forever? Texas forever. All right. What the heck are you doing here? I was... Do you mind if I hold him? Yeah, all right. - Here's your daddy, sweetheart. - Hello, little man. Here's your daddy. Hey, you! You remember me, right? Erin, I made some serious changes in my life in the last couple of weeks. I just got a job in the city. In Manhattan. It's just an entry level position but... I have my foot pretty solidly in the door of a... pretty great sports agency. And I'm... I'm gonna be making about $40,000 a year, which I hear isn't much around this neck of the woods, but... I just... I want you to be able to take some time off and... just be with Noah and be home. And I'm gonna find a place to live, and I would... I would really like that to be with you and Noah... if that's what you want. If that's not what you want, I'm still gonna find a place close to here. {\You know, }Far enough away, I won't be a stalker or anything, but close enough that... Close enough that I can be here. For you and for him, 'cause... I'm never gonna let this baby down, ever. Jason... I've missed you. I've missed you so much. - I missed you too. - Sweetheart, it's all good. All right, listen up! It's the playoffs, gentlemen. This is where the fun begins. For those of you who've been out here before, you know what I'm talking about. For those of you who haven't... you will. Get out of my car. - Seriously? - This is not a joke. Get out of my car.
