Okay, I got it. You can just go back to sleep if you want to. Morning. Landry, um, I'm sure whatever that you're about to say is gonna make perfect sense and be absolutely practical. And basically ruin the best night of my life. Well, this... This just can't happen again. - Okay. - All right? I... I have to go. - I'll see you. - At school... You'll see me at school. It'll all be fine. - Just gonna go out the window? - Yeah, I'm just gonna go here. - You need some help? - No, I'm good. I'm good. Yeah, I'll see you. - You got it? - Yeah, good. I'll talk to you later. Bye, baby. I gotta get going. Well that just sucks. We're all waiting to see how Coach MacGregor can pick up the slack after he who shall remain nameless, - A.K.A. Coach Taylor, - A.K.A. Judas. He cashed in on us by taking his college job, just as fast as was humanly possible. Hey, Coach, here's your order. I know you're in a hurry to hit the road. Sorry about the radio. It's fine. Hey, thanks guys. Hey, coach. Hey, Matt. How you doing? I just wanted to apologize for everything with Julie. - Apologize for what? - It's just that we broke up. I didn't know that you were broke up. She probably doesn't want to bother you... Like, you know, stress you or, you know, while you're in Austin. Tell... Tell Miss Taylor I'm sorry too. Come on, Riggins! You have this half-assed, candy-assed, lame-assed, whiskey breath, dirty hair attitude. You'll wake up in the morning and find your career gone! Like a memory, like a postcard, like a bad dream! Like a love affair, a night train! Get those knees up in the air and get that tire up! Wear it like a crown! Praise the game of football! That's what I want to see. Show me something! That's it... Yeah! You earned it now. Get up, Riggins! Get a trainer in here! Get up. Give him some room. 2x02: ARE YOU READY FOR FRIDAY NIGHT? Transcript: www.swsub.com Subtitles : GillesSilb, Ju, Sixe I don't know what the hell you think you're doing to yourself, Tim. You're completely dehydrated, your body went into shock, and whose wouldn't? I don't understand what you're trying to do to yourself. The front desk can't get a hold of Billy to come down and pick you up. Yeah, he's probably screwing my ex-girlfriend. And we can't release you without an adult signature. So, any other relative we could call? No. Okay. We'll keep trying Billy. You ready for Friday? Always, sir. Attaboy. How you feeling? I am feeling a bit better now. You should try going to practice without a hangover. I hear it's a totally different game. Yeah, that's kind of what I'm afraid of. So, uh, you just come here to check up on me? I'm here as a friend. It's the least I could do after you helped me with my dad the other night. What? What? I think you should come to my church. Is this, like, a recruitment deal you got going? - You know, get 'em when they're down? - No... I care about you, Tim. I care about you. And I see that you're lost, which is exactly how I felt. I'm not lost. This is Dillon. It's home of the Panthers, right? You can be lost in Dillon, you know? All right, let me ask you. Are you trying to be a cliche? *stem cell surgery in Mexico? Oh! Oh, let me check my watch. Yep, been about a year. Yeah, you're actually right on time for the miracle surgery portion of the show. It's not a miracle surgery. I'm not crazy, all right. This isn't insane. They've great results with rats. Getting movement back in their hind legs. I hate to break it to you, but you don't have hind legs, so you're screwed. I wanted to walk too. We all did. But you actually thinking you're gonna do it again, people will take advantage of that, Street. They'll take your money and what's left of your dignity. It's a scam, QB. Don't say you weren't warned. Come on, let's go! Coach, I don't think this is gonna work. Son, it's a five-step drop. You settle in, find the lane, get rid of the ball. Is there anything magical to that? Come on, let's go. Trust me. Now with, uh, with Jackson, we got the height problem of course. He's having trouble seeing the lanes. - I'll put him in a shorter... - Cut the kid loose. We don't need him. Well, coach, I think that's a bit premature. He's got some talent. Just cut the boy. He's not performing. We don'tave time to waste with this. Tell him he's gone and start focusing on that kid from Midland. You... You want me to tell him? Yeah. Hey, babe. How you doing? Hey, baby. How's your day going? Going all right. I have the distinct privilege of cutting one of the kids from the team today. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, did you try turning it off, then turning it on again? - Yes, yes. - Okay. - Who's that? - That's Glenn, darling. What's he doing at the house? Glenn is here helping me at the moment try to get the ice maker to work. I don't want Glenn with his hands in my wife's ice box. I'll fix it when I get home on the weekend. All right. That would be great. Well, um, is that what you called to talk to me about? No. Listen. Did you forget to tell me that Julie and Matt broke up? No, Julie and Matt didn't break up. Yeah, they did. It's all over the school. It's huge, everybody's talking about it. Hey babe, tell Glenn to sit down and be quiet. No, honey, I did not know that Julie and Matt broke up. Don't you think that's a little bit of a problem? I do, I think that's a problem that she didn't say anything to me. What would you say is the main difference in this year's team? For one, Coach "M" is stressing the running game. That's for one and, uh... If he wants to put the ball in my hands, I know I can carry it. - As in carry the team? - Ha, no... I wouldn't say that, but I'll put it like this. The Smash is in the zone like never before. - Oh, I'm ready to run with that ball. - Saracen, you hearing this guy? He's out of control, man. Listen, somebody's gotta say something to him. I'll say something. Tim Riggins? Mr. Garrity? Yeah. You doing okay? - Yes, sir. - Good, good. You've been through a traumatic experience. I'm gonna sign you out right now. That guy's pushing you guys way too hard. He's got you out there running in the hot, blazing sun. Showing no mercy. And I got from my inside sources that the practices have been running over 15 minutes. Ran over today. It's no wonder you passed out. Actually, I think I passed out 'cause I was hungover, Mr. Garrity. Sir? I want you to listen to me, Tim Riggins. I don't want to ever hear you say that again. I've seen you play with a hangover many times and you played like a champ. This is because of that coach. This is all about MacGregor, and I don't want you to put any of it on yourself. Okay? Okay. Hey, Smash, can I talk to you for a minute? Sure, Matty. What's up? Look, some of the guys on the team have kind of been talking a little bit. Some of the guys, huh? They kind of feel, like, there's sort of some inequity. What are you bringing out the $10 words on me for, man? What's up? Smash, you're not the only person on this team. - Yeah, I know that. - Then why don't you act like it? I mean, this team's kind of just falling apart. We're supposed to be leaders, so we... Look, look... Matty, matty... Ain't none of this my fault. If y'all are mad 'cause Coach is making this a running offense, go talk to him. Ain't nothing I can do about it. There's nothing you can do about it? You want me to go tell him to change his strategy? No, but I want you to act like a captain because you are the captain. So step up and try... Oh, so you pissed 'cause he made me captain. No, I don't care that he made you captain. I really do not. I'm sorry he's not using you the way that coach Taylor did. You want to get real? Let's get real. Yeah, I'm loving this. Why shouldn't I? It's my year. I'm a senior. Why shouldn't I be the star? This is my recruitment year. Okay, my future's on the line every Friday night. I gotta do what's best for me right now. And at the end of this, I'll graduate and it'll be your turn. Live with it, Matt. Say, girl. Why don't you step up into my g-ride? Hey, girl. Got you some clean laundry, finally. It's okay, you can just leave it there. I'll deal with it. I don't mind, sweetheart. So did I hear that you and Matt Saracen broke up? Yep. How you doing with that? Fine. - Well, who broke up with who? - Mom, look... I really just don't really want to talk about it, okay? - Was it 'cause of that boy at the pool? - No. Honey. I just want you to know I'm here for you, hon. And you can always talk to me. Okay. Thanks. I think your baby's crying. There's not really any prime time apples. There we go. It's a good catch, Smash. Take a little bit of air off that. Good catch, Smash. Look at this, look at this. Ladies, glad you decided to join us today. Let's get a little jog going. That means you too, Saracen. Red jersey does not mean you get to walk<today. Opening day is upon us, gentlemen! Get your asses in motion. Bradley, didn't we tell you to lose that baby fat in the off season. Can't tell? I lost three pounds! Tip of the iceberg, Bradley. Stairmaster is your friend, okay? Gentlemen, we get better or we get worse every day. Let's get a little better today. We need Riggins to bring his "A" game Friday night. Why don't you go and talk to him? You know, pump him up. Can you do that? Yes, sir. Thank you, Coach. Thank you, Coach. All right. All right. Riggins. Timmy. - Tim! - Yeah. - Timmy, open the damn door! - Yeah. What's going on, jay? Missed you at practice today, Riggs. Yeah, doc told me to rest, so... - I'm resting. - Yeah, he prescribe you a 12-pack too? No, that was me. What the hell you doing, Tim? Seriously. Am I talking to coach street or friend street, because you've been pretty confused lately. Don't go there, all right? Did coach MacGregor give you a gold star for this one? Shut the hell up, Riggins! That's not what this is about. This isn't about coach and me. This is about you. Tim, look at yourself. You're a screw-up. You're the one that didn't show up. The one that's always late. The one that doesn't take your life seriously. You know, when you make the choice between friend and coach, pick friend 'cause you make a lousy coach. Clean yourself up, and get your ass to practice. Great coaching tactic. I mean, that fire under my ass has been lit! Go to hell, Riggins. Go to hell, Tim. Hey, Carlotta? Yes? I'm noticing sort of a little bit of... of... of a trend going on. A trend? Yeah, it seems like everybody's laundry gets done except for mine, grandma's got a lot of clean clothes and I see some of yours. And I got... And I got no clean socks. Oh, than I suggest you wash some. Right, and I will wash... It's just, I gotta go to school. And I got two practices a day and I gotta go to work. So... I just sorta thought that maybe you'd be helping out in that whole area. Why? Because I have brown skin? No, not because... I didn't think it was that crazy of an idea to think that maybe... I have a job: taking care of your grandmother. I'm a caregiver, not a maid. I'm an "A" student. My father in Guatemala is a teacher. And my mother runs an insurance office. I came here to put myself through college. To study to be a nurse. To help people. And not to do your laundry. Right, but doing laundry helps people. The washing machine is over there. - How's my girl? - All right. Landry, how was school today? You know, not bad. Same ol' same ol'. You makin' any new or different friends now that you're a panther? Not... Not really. Pretty much just the same old friends. You gotta be meeting some girls, don't you? I mean, maybe a little bit. But nothing... Nothing to write home about. Mom got these crackers that you like. Oh, that is sin in a box. Hey, bubba. Where's your watch? It's in... It's in the drawer. I had it cleaned. Glad to hear you're taking good care of it. That watch has been in the family over 60 years. Your grandpa's gonna want to see you wearing it when he comes, next month. - He's gonna see it. - Baby, what's for dinner? Uh, pork chops... And wild rice, and caesar salad. Good practice. Pick it up, guys! Yeah, we need to talk. Let me talk to you after practice, all right? No, actually I mean in person. - It's important. - What's it about? I can't tell you. What do you mean? Is someone dead? What? If I told you, you wouldn't come, that's why. Now listen. Uh, I'll meet you half way. Two hours for each of us to drive there. Don't to this. I'm not gonna come somewhere to meet you when you tell me that if I knew what it was I wouldn't come in the first place. Eric, you need to make time for this. I'm telling you this as your friend. It's important. I'll call you back. Let's go, break it down! Another productive day at the office I see. You screwing jackie? Why would you ask me that? 'Cause I saw you sneaking out of her place at 6:00 in the morning. Look, I... I would've told you. Jackie wasn't comfortable with it. We've been seeing each other for about six weeks now. It's pretty serious. You didn't really think that you two were gonna ever have any some... some kind of serious relationship, did you? Why not? 'Cause she's a 33-year-old woman and you're a 17-year-old kid. You can't even take care of yourself. How were you planning on taking care of her? No, come here when I'm talking to you, Tim. Tim! Jesus said, "if you will just repent "and be sorry for your past, "I will take all of your past away. "just say 'forgive me, forgive me of my past.'" and then he said, "follow me at my burial." First of all, you follow Jesus in his death. You have a past that you cannot do away with. You have a past that if you even think about it, it brings so many horrible memories to you. I know the drugs and I know all the immorality. And I know all the things you've done because I deal with it every day in different people. I speak to that special person again in this building, that you think God no longer loves you. He loves you very, very much. And the person that invited you to come to church tonight is God's agent. He used that agent so that you could be brought back into the presence of God. And tonight, he is going to touch you. When I win that game on Friday, you gotta give me a massage. Hmm, like a full body massage? Yeah, I'm gonna need that deep tissue. You good with that? You didn't happen to bring any of those burgers up rom the freezer? I've been on the counter. I've been busy. I can see that you've been real busy. Hey, would you calm down, Mr. Manager? I'm doing my job, okay? You working it all right. It's going real quick. Come on. We gotta get the healing going on, got an opening game Friday. So maybe if you get to work, and I do my work, then we can get out of here quicker and start thinking about our game. This one kind of looks like it. It really doesn't look anything like it, except for the fact that they are both watches and have hands and tell time. You don't have to say anything to this, but I mean if my watch is found with the body I'm gonna be completely implicated. Which, um... That's fine, I mean, I did it. But I'm not gonna do anything to drag you into it. I promise. I'll do everything in my power to keep you out of it. Keep you safe. I just wanted to say. Well, I just figured I could always kill you to keep you silent. That was creepy. - Hi. - Tim. What are you... Get out of my room. Who let you in? - Little Garrity. Two minutes. - Get out! What are you doing here? Two minutes. That's all I'm asking. That's it. Okay, two minutes. It's late, Tim. Something happened to me last night that... I have no idea what it was, but I felt something. Okay. I felt something so strong that it made me wonder about everything you've been saying isn't as crazy as what everyone thought. And it's hard for me to understand the feeling. Listen, it's okay. It's kind of embarrassing. It's okay. It allowed me to feel part of something, part of the people, part of you, part of God. Even saying that is scary. - Did you feel it? - Yeah, I felt it. I always feel it. Sorry. What are you doing? I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing, Lyla. I guess I feel closer to God if I'm with you. You feel closer to God when you're with me? I'm sorry. Did you think that line was gonna work on me? It's not a line. Get out. Go! The team is screwed. It's screwed. There's no leadership. And it's all because of McGregor. There's something wrong with that guy. He's mean. I think he's evil. You're just pissed off 'cause he kicked you off the field and took the barbecue out of the dealership? I hate his guts, but that's not the reason. Well, just out of curiosity, what is the reason that I am here right now? What if I told you that I could make him go away and you could have your job back? I'd say you're crazy. I'd say you're crazy and I got a job. I'm not gonna get rid of the guy unless I know that you will come back. What are you, crazy? You got anything else? 'Cause I'm getting ready to scoot. - I got something... - Go ahead. - I got something. - Throw it at me. I've seen Tami, I've seen Julie. Tami's trying to be so brave and so strong without her husband here. And I see how sad she is. I see Julie walking around in things she shouldn't be wearing, hanging out with kids she shouldn't be hanging out with. And you know that little baby Gracie misses her daddy, you know it. First year of her life she never sees her daddy. Your family needs you. They Miss you. And I know you miss your family. So I want you to think about this for one minute. If you could just go back in time and make the TMU job go away, and be the coach of the Panthers again, would you do it? Jules, this is your mother. It's past 2:00 in the morning, and you had best call me as fast as you can. I don't wanna beat a dead horse, but let's go over it again. Vampires, real. - Moon isn't real. - The moon isn't? No, the landing wasn't real. No, the moon isn't real, Dylan. Dinosaur in the congo. One world government and Al Gore is the commissar of the whole thing. Or the one where Al Gore is a robot. So is your mother. Ipods have a mind of their own and they will actually take us all over in a short amount of weeks. - Hyperbolic... Time savers. - Nanotechnology. Nanotechnology. Good one! And then there's the whole global warming issue which is some big giant diabolical illusion created by the EPA who are out there strangling polar bears with their bare hands. Ooh, strangling polar bears! Nice. Get in the house right now! Get in the house right now, Julie! - You should go... - I'm not going in. Take me somewhere. I can't take you anywhere. That's kidnapping. I don't care. Take me somewhere. Get in there right now! I'm not going in. I'm not going in! What's wrong with you? - Get out! - Have you totally lost it? I'm not getting out! What the hell are you doing? I am your mother, all right? And you have not grown up yet! And you are not rid of me yet. Go to hell! You got rid of me when you had Gracie and dad left! You know what? You need to learn to live with that. Hi, welcome to Applebee's. What can I get for you? I'm gonna have the quesadilla burger and an iced tea. - All right. - So tell me something. Are you and my son dating? I... I, um... Well, I... I don't know actually. 'Cause I have to tell you, uh, I really don't get it. I mean, no disrespect intended. But, uh, as a parent, I just don't understand it. I mean, you could date pretty much anyone you want to. What do you want with my kid Landry? Landry... He's, um... He's wonderful guy. He's smart and kind. And he's caring. He's funny and he's really nice to be around. But you should know that, being his father and all. I appreciate that. You want that burger medium or well-done? Medium's fine. Thank you. Friday night at last. Friday night at last.</i> Thank God almighty. It's Friday night at last. A whole new season, a new coach. And maybe a whole new era for Panther football.</i> This team has been to the top of the mountain.</i> And we all know the higher the mountain, the harder the fall. Let's look for coach McGregor to give the ball to his big bright shining star,</i> Brian "Smash" Williams. Coach McGregor has made it clear that Smash Williams will be getting busy tonight.</i> Bring on the Smash. Bring on the Smash. He's pretty, he's fast. Keep that going! Keep that going, baby! One thing's for sure, coach McGregor should be starting his regime</i> with a victory tonight. Even though there're rumblings of dissension in the locker room,</i> hopefully it won't make its way onto the field.</i> It's a big high bomber. The rivals take it deep in their own end zone.</i> He's out the five. He breaks right... Oh, great move inside!</i> He comes to the edge of the 40, the 50... He's crossing midfield! Oh, my, and down he goes at the Panther 40! Mercy me, folks. Expectations are sky-high here in Dillon. And if McGregor expects to walk in the boots of the great Eric Taylor, he better get a hold of this game quick. 'cause these Rattlers have come to play. Black... 53! Hike! Pitch to williams up the middle. Oh, williams is just... The Panthers are on their way. Hey coach, I think we got to freeze those linebackers. Maybe they'll play next to the tight end. Not right now, okay! Not right now! Right now just let me coach, all right? Come on out! Saracen opens left, pitches to Smash... Oh no, it's on the carpet!</i> Williams picks it up. He's got nowhere to go. Second and 19. No! Come on, now! Hut! Saracen goes left! He's got Williams in flat.</i> Oh, interception! Smash takes him down. Oh my! What the hell was that? What the hell was that? I lost it, all right? Put the ball in my hands! - It got away from me. - Just put the ball in my hands, Matty! You guys make it work! I want to see you work out there. Come on, get your head back in the game, baby. It'll be there. - Come on, man, we can do this. - I'm right here. Let's go ahead and do something then! Come on, D! Next time we get the ball, I think it's time to go against the grain. Play action to a wide-receiver... We got a situation right now. And we're on C, all right? I understand that. I don't have time to take advice from the team mascot, all right? I'm a little busy. Come on now! I'm talking to you, 50 Joe! 50 Joe, come on! It's on you! Late in the fourth quarter, Gridlocked at zeros, the Panther blow out did not happen. And now it's gut check time. Saracen opens left. Oh, it'a a busted play. No! Down goes Saracen. McGregor looks very unhappy. He's pulling Smash Williams over to the sideline.</i> Looks like he's giving Smash the play. Here we go. What's the play? 190-24 arrow. Panthers in shotgun. Oh, it's a direct snap to williams. Powers up the middle. He breaks the tacklew. Touchdown! Smash Williams has carried this team on his back</i> and he has brought home the "w" for Dillon.</i> You know, I think coach McGregor might've made a big statement right there.</i> Saracen was out of the play completely. Used him as a decoy. Looks like he just rewired his offense. What's up! Aw, what's up! What's up! Smash Williams is the Dillon Panther offense.</i> Next time, Matty. You gonna get yours next time. Get off me! Get off of me! You want some? You can get it! You want some? Come on! Lost your mind, man! What's wrong with you? Get your hands off me! What's wrong with y'all! Take him inside. - Hi. - Hi. Don't trip over the laundry. Did you see the game tonight? Did you hear what happened at the game tonight? I hit Julie last night. Right across the face. I slapped her. I think I'm completely losing it. I don't know what's happening with our family. All right. You could've knocked, Six. I came here to tell you something. It's the only reason I'm here. And to put an end to this so-called friendship that we got. I quit the team tonight. I didn't want you to think for one second it had anything to do with you telling me I suck as a coach 'cause "A", I don't care what you think. And "B", I don't suck. I'm an awesome coach. Just with McGregor around there's not a whole hell of a lot for me to do. That's good, 'cause I got more important things to do. I'm going to Mexico. I'm gonna have surgery. I'll probably be walking next time you see me. and the first thing I'm gonna do is walk over here so I could kick your ass. 'Cause you are the worst and stupidest friend that a guy could ever have in this world. Pretty much hate your guts right now. I'm so disgusted in you. I'm disappointed. Mexico, huh? Hi! Jeez, what are you... You okay? Yeah, no... I'm good. - Well... - You okay? Yeah, no... I just... - Tyra, look... We don't have... - You know what? Just... Just be quiet. No one's ever cared for me so much. Here. No. - Put it away. - We're going to Mexico. - What do you mean, put it away? - We're still in Texas, idiot. We got a map? Yes, I have a map. Well, what are you waiting for? Let's go. Hi. There's some food on the stove. I'm not really hungry. You look like hell. Thanks. I think I did something to my shoulder. Sit down. Let me look at it. It's not that bad. Sit down. - You sure you know... - Yeah. Sit down! 'Cause, you know, you're not a nurse yet. - Shut up. - You're still in sch... Turn. - Here? - Yeah. Here? - Here. - Yeah. Better? Yeah, a little bit. What... What is that? A song my mom sang to us when we got hurt. It's hard to translate because it's nonsense. Something about a frog and a butt and a saint. Seriously. That's funny. Point of it is, however, that if things are not good today, they will be better tomorrow. Things will be better. Yes! We gonna rock and roll? I sure as hell hope I don't regret this. No way. Let's go in.
