Yeah. - That's an idea, huh? - Yeah. - Although I think I might have to decline, 'cause I've kind of been down that road before, Where a girl asked me to do something, And I just kind of said yes. And all of a sudden, everyone's calling me a word That I don't like to use. - You're invited to the party. You are too. - Well, you could've just said that to begin with. - Thanks for the invitation. - So you cool? You want to come? - Yeah, I think that sounds great. - It's gonna be a lot of fun. - It's gonna be fun. - All right, see you later. - Okay, bye. - Okay. - All right. - So you're gonna go to a party in kilroy. - Yeah, I am. What is that? Why with that tone? - But I have to tell you that when I die, I hope people will say that she gave More than she took. That would be true success to me. Mom. I'm in. - Oh, my god! I could not be any prouder of you, becky. You make it look so easy, and it's not. It is not easy at all. It is such hard work. - Thanks, mom. - You know what?

I know, how about tomorrow before my shift, We could go find the perfect dress, The perfect shoes, and then get a bite to eat. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, tomorrow's great. - Okay. I can't wait to watch those other girls eat your dust. - I got to ask you something, And I need you to not be weird about it. - What's up? - There's this place right outside of dillon Called steers, And I was wondering if you'd go there with me. - Steers? - It's-- It's gay. I mean, it's a gay place. - Are you hitting on me? - No. You're not my type. - Oh, I'm not your type? - Look, I just need somebody to go there with me. This is a new experience, and it's kind of weird. And it'd be nice to have a friend go with me. - I'll go. See what your type is like. [engine turning] - Well, I think where we need to focus All our attention right now is library, library, library. It's been since 2005 since we've had any updates. It'z where we should focus our funds. - Yeah, but, um, you know, I'm--I'm really sorry. Our budget is already tapped out. Maybe we can do this next year. - But, no, I mean, you know, We had actually pushed it last year, And we had talked about that this-- This would be where our focus was this year. - Look, there are a lot of people Who are pretty angry out there, tami. I mean, you realize that a substantial portion Of the school's revenue is generated by football, Don't you? - Oh, so you mean people are angry Because I told luke cafferty that he had to go To the correct school for his district? That's why we're not gonna get our library? That seems like a shame to me. - Look, after what you did with luke, We're gonna be lucky To reach half the normal amount this year. I mean, you cost yourself and the school Any chance we might have had to improve that library. Now, I'm sorry, tami, if you'll excuse me, I do have another meeting. - [gasps] What? - Hello, mr. Rc collins, class of '79? Mr. Collins, I would like to talk to you about football. I would like to talk to you About east dillon high school football And coach eric taylor.

Again. - There is a gay bar in dillon? - It's not in dillon. It's outside of dillon. - It's the same difference. - Mr. Matthew, "za" is not a word. - "za" is a word. And if you look at it, it spells "za," As in "pizza." It's vernacular in certain places, but wait-- - You are such a liar. - Don't try and distract me from the fact That you're going to a gay bar. What are you gonna do at--at a gay bar? - Dance and make out with some chicks. - I-I knew it. I knew you wanted to experiment. - No, I'm going for devin to be her moral support. - Whatever, I don't even care. I'm going hunting with riggins anyway. - That's a joke. You're going hunting with riggins? - It's not a joke. - So you're just gonna go shoot some poor defenseless animals For the hell of it? - Uh... Yeah, well, to eat. - You are so much better than that. Why would you stoop to that level? - No, I'm not. I'm not better than that. - It's disgusting. - Whoa, hold on. Hold the phone. I live in dillon. And people in dillon, what they do Is they go hunting and shoot animals. That's just the way it works. - That is an awful excuse, first of all. And second of all, I live in dillon. I don't go hunting. - You don't live in dillon for long. I need a word... Word. - Is this about my college applications? - No, it's not about your college applications. It's not even about you. I don't know why you think everything's about you. - No. No. All of this says runner-up. None of this is good. - I'm sure your mom wanted to be here for this. - Yeah, or she hooked up with some dude. You know, whatever. - Hey, look, cut her some slack. I'm sure-- - Don't. [voice breaking] okay, because every time Something really important comes along, Every time, she does this.

It's pretty. - You think it's pretty? - Yeah. - Is that a portrait neckline? - Yeah. - This is stupid. You don't even know. Can we go, please? - No, wait, we can't go. We're here. We got to pick something. And what's that saying? Doesn't the dress find you? - Can we please just go? This was such a dumb idea. - [sighs] I'm gonna tell you something, all right? And you can't tell it to anyone else. Well, my mother never took me shopping for a pageant gown. And because of that... I never placed at miss texas. That's why I got into football. That's a fact. This is what we're gonna do. We're gonna start with the wheels, And then we'll work our way up. By then, hopefully they'll have A new shipment of dresses in. Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª - Hey, landry.

With that said, We are facing-- I am facing a lot of challenges over there. And we've got some problems that I want-- - With all due respect, People from your part of town Pretty frequently tell us about our problems, Our crime problems, our education problems. You know how we got these problems? Back in the '80s, the west side of dillon got developed. They got the mall. They got the hotel. The west side of dillon got the money. - What did we get? - We got forgotten. - We got our high school closed. - And so listen, we thank you for your hospitality, But I think I'm gonna skip that lecture About our problems. - Well, I know nobody needs a lecture here, That's for sure. - That's right. - I think the truth is, We just--we just wanted to get to know y'all A little bit better, and I was just hoping Y'all would get to know my husband a little bit better, Because if there's one thing about this man, He loves football. He loves football. He loves those boys out there. Lives and breathes it. You know, it's family to us. - Fact of the matter is it's pretty damn hard Playing football when you've got nobody out there Appreciating the effort that you're putting into it. - You like losing with everybody watching? - Well, deacon, that's what we're trying to fix. [doorbell chimes] we're trying to fix that. - Hmm. - Hello. - Oh, hey, buddy. How are you? - How are you? - Is that buddy garrity? - You know buddy? - Do I know buddy?

I don't know. It's like he seems pissed off About, like, the stupidest things, And then we get in these ridiculous arguments That go absolutely nowhere, and it's like-- It's like I don't know how to fix us. It's like something that's broken or--I don't know. You're not even paying attention. What are you looking at? - Don't look over there. - Is that your type? She's cute. - I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Don't flirt while I'm gone, okay? - You know me. - Almost what?

You are both gonna say Exactly what I tell you to say, And we are gonna fix this. Understood? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - You get one chance in life, fellas. You can either take advantage of it, Or you can piss it away. You do the latter, And you're gonna regret it the rest of your lives. Get out. [locks open] Get out of the car. - He really took off.

And I knew that was gonna happen. Obviously, I knew that she was gonna go to college, But I guess I just never realized The fact that all the colleges she was gonna be applying to Were, like, on the other side of the country. And now, you know, I started just getting mad at her For no reason. It's like I resent it, But she never asked me to stay here, you know? That was my decision. I decided to do that. I decided that.
