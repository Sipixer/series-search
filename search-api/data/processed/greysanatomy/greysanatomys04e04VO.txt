Norman is an intern. I'm your sister. You're not a girl I ever wanted to have to know because our dad chose you. My niece's cancer's come back. She's 17 years old and she's gonna die. Alex,I'm sorry. I can't. I slept with izzie. in life,only one thing is certain... apart from death and taxes... no matter how hard you try, no matter how good  your intentions, you are going to make mistakes. callie. You're going to hurt people. You're going to get hurt. And if you ever want  to recover... you haven't said anything in... in... just say something. Please. Anything. There's really only one thing  you can say. I forgive you. What? You made a mistake. But we took vows... till death do us part... so... I forgive you. Izzie,why aren't you picking up your phone? You need to pick up your phone. I just talked to callie and... george. I gotta find izzie. - We have rounds in five minutes. - Right after I find izzie. You wanna go away with me this weekend? Why would I want to go away with you? Because of this. We didn't go away when we were a couple. Now we're not a couple,and not couples have no reason to go away together. Meredith,you're not paying attention. I'm talking about 48 uninterrupted hours of this. Where would we go? Wine country. Wine country sounds like a couples' place. Well,there's wine,there's country,and you wouldn't see any of it. We'd be in bed all weekend. Oh,a weekend of sex. Now you're paying attention. well,I would have to get someone to cover for me. Okay,so you're in? 48 uninterrupted hours of this. I'm in. Oh,great. I'm stuck in the pit protecting smackheads and gangbangers with my idiot interns, and you're getting mcdreamied in the elevator? Really,smackheads and gangbangers at seattle grace,huh? My point is,I hate interns. Well,lexie's not that bad,is she? Oh,are we not hating her anymore? Oh,no. We still hate the idea of her. We just realized we don't have a reason to hate the actual person. She's an intern. That's reason enough. I think you may be the new nazi. Damn right. I don't see any charts. Will you work for me on saturday? What's in it for me? What do you want? - Take norman off my hands today. - Who? The world's oldest intern. I've got mynterns in the pit,and he's only gonna slow me down. Ageist. Deal? Fine. Rounds. Still can't find izzie. I'm gonna have to put you in the clinic if you miss rounds. Oh,the clinic! Uh,ms.Sayles,hi.I'm dr.Bailey. Oh,you are? Uh,the boyfriend who warned her not to read on the stairmaster. That's how I did this. I fell off last night. I took a ton of ibuprofen,but when I woke up this morning,it was huge and hideous. How much ibuprofen did you take? I usually take some every day anyway,because of the gym, so I doubled the dose,but it did nothing for me. Okay,let's get some x-rays and then... actually,can I justst get ahot of cortisone or something? I'm supposed to meet my trainer anoon. Uh,ms.Sayles,I can't treat you until I find out what's wrong with you. Have you seen dr.Stevens? Check the pit. Right. What time do you think we'll be done? Just so I can tell my trainer. lexie! Sorry. - Uh,have you seen dr.Stevens? - No. - Have you seen dr.Yang? - No. She told me to meet her here in the pit,and she's not here. I don't want to give that woman any more reasons to hate me. - Good for you. - I'm prepared. I'm gonna answer every question correctly. And I'm not gonna take any more of her crap. Three! Incoming,let's move. He got hit during a scrimmage. Are you the coach? He's my dad. And his coach. He was charging the receiver after the kickoff. He got blocked,had his head down,couldn't see the other guy coming. I had my head down because the guy blocking me was hoing it down. You could've gotten past that guy. I need you to leave the room. Okay,let's cut him out of his equipment. I need the saw. Dr.GreyI need you to help me stabilize his neck and his head,please. It's very important,adam,that you not move your head. I need you to keep perfectly still. Don't move. Relax. - O'malley,what's the hur? - Sorry,I can't talk,chief. O'malley? I... sorry,I... I just gotta find izzie. She's at the third floor nurses' station. Oh. Thanks. Oh,and...and when you find her, tell her dr.Torres is looking or her. now I know charting doesn't seem as exciting as surgery, but it is every bit as important. Believe me when I tell you,people,penmanship saves lives. Pick up your phone. What kind of doctor doesn't pick up their phone? Is that a 7 or is that a 9? If I have to ask myself that question in the middle of an emergency,your patient is dead. You killed him with your handwriting. Think about that. Callie. Hey. Hi. We have to talk. Okay. Um,about? George told me. - He told you? - Everything. Cafeteria,noon,you and me. Be there. Dude,is she gonna kick her ass? -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> sync:YTET-Ö¥Ê¿µ°¸â ÏûÉùÄä¼£ -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font> Greys Anatomy Season 04 Episode 04</font> She forgave you? She said I had a rough year, that people make mistakes,and that... - that I made a mistake. - Oh,so now I'm a mistake? back off! No,she said that. I didn't say that. What did you say? Um,I didn't expect her to forgive me. I expected... rage,uh,bloodshed. No,she's saving all her rage and bloodshed for me. - She's gonna kill me in the cafeteria at lunch. - No,she wouldn'T. She breaks bones for a living,george. She's crazy. No,she's not crazy. Well,she is if she thinks I'm not gonna put up a fight. I can't believe that kid's dad. I mean,his son is paralyzed,and the guy's still riding him. Focus more on the medicine,three,and less on the tragedy. Three? Is that a nickname? You could say that. So how would you proceed,dr.Grey? Oh,um...you won't be able to operate unless you realign his spine,would you? And how would you do that? Traction halo? Very impressive,dr.Grey. Your intern year's off to a good start. How's it going? How are you and meredith? It's weird,the whole family thing. And plus,I think she might still hate me. She doesn't hate you. Really? Did she say that? You know,why don't you go see if mrs.Cooley's dressings need changing? Yang,why don't you go see if mrs.Cooley's dressing needs changing? Certainly. Dr.Sloan,dr.Norman shales. Oh,dr.Shales,call me mark. Thank you. I thought you were on my service. I am. He's my intern. I know,right? It's like,"seriously,you're an intern?" But it's seriously true. Seriously. glad to have you aboar norman. So is he the one you call,uh... mcdreamy or,mc,uh,sleazy,or mc,uh,wait a minute,what is it? - Norman,we have labs to deliver. - Yeah. Labs and discharges. Uh,this one's being discharged to hospice? When there's nothi else we can do. So we have to tell someone they're dying? Don't worry. I'll teach you the protocol. Mcsteamy! He's the one you girls call mcsteamy. you paged me,dr.Bailey? Oh,I didn't know you were... I'm in the clinic. Or I was... what have you got? ruthie sayles. Says she twisted her ankle falling off the stairmaster. She didn't twist it. She crushed it. We should book an O.R.Right away. Dr.Torres,you don't think we should run a few tests first? Find out why ruthie's bones are so fragile in the first place? She's osteoporotic. I see it in older women all the time. Now you're seeing it in a 28 year old. Oh,right. Call me when you get the test results. I can't talk about it with you. - Well,is she all right? - Yeah. So when giving a patient the bad news, you want to be polite and detached,but not cold. How can you be detached but not cold? You show that you care without actually allowing yourself to care, because if you get too emotional,then they get scared, and then they get emotional,and that's bad. Seriously? Stop with the seriously. Uh,I'm sorry. I know it must be hard being older than most of us, but I think you're gonna go a lot further if you just let everything else go and focus on the medicine. - Hey,are you aware that mcdreamy and the other grey are bonding? - Bonding? Over their mutual meredith greyness. What do you mean? They're talking about me? - What are they saying? - Oh,I don't know. He's making me deal with his patients while they focus on what's really important...you. Cristina! What was I saying? You were saying how important it was to focus on the medicine. Just give me the chart. First we're going to apply halo,which uses weights and traction to pull your spine back into place. Traction? Like at the gym. We stretch your upper body using weights until the tension pops the spine into position. Except unlike at the gym, dr.Shepherd needs to attach the traction device directly to your head by screwing two bolts into your skull. That sounds painful. Painful is if he doesn't fix your spine. Painful is you never walk again. okay. We gonna do this thing or what? I told you not to get too emotional. I couldn't help it. What now? go apologize one last time. once again,ma'am,we are very,very sorry... very sorry. and now? Now we slowly and respectfully back out of the room. alex,I need a favor. I don't have time for favors. I'm working here. Well,what are you doing at lunch? According to my interns,I'm watching torres kick your ass all up and down the cafeteria. How do they know? So it's true. What'd you do to her? Nothing. Dude. we need a little help here! Oh,thank god. Somebody I know. Will somebody please make sure they page my husband? Who is she? It's the chief's niece. camille travis,18,I tried intubating 3 times. There's some kind of obstruction. My baby can't breathe. Sats staying down. They're at 82%. She needs a surgical airway. Somebody get me a crike tray. How many emergency crikes have you done? Including this one? One. Dude,it's the chief's niece. pulse is getting weaker. So we better not screw this up. what are you doing? trying to help her breathe. she just slit her throat! Suction. I need suction. - Get the retractors in. - There's so much blood. You didn hit an artery,did you? No,not on purpose. - Oh,god. - Oh,god. Get the tube. oh,god. sats are going up. Oh,we did it. Oh,richard! What the hell are you doing to my niece? one thing this childdid not need was another surgery. She wasn't breathing,chief. we didn't know what else to do. You did the right thing. But camille was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 14. She's had both ovaries removed,a hysterectomy and now this... there it is,the mass. no wonder she couldn't breathe. I can take it out. But we won't know how many more there are until we do further studies. I'm so sorry,chief. She beat it twice before. She'll beat it again. I just had to tell a 48-year-old woman that she's gonna die. Yeah? I wish I could tell a 24-year-old woman she's gonna die. I have gone out of my way to be nice to her, and this is what she does,talks about me behind my back? When were you nice to her? I was nice... once. My point is... hey,meredith. Hey,norman. 'Sup,lexie? come on,norman. Um...dr.Shepherd asked that we meet in adam's room in ten minutes. You could at least acknowledge that you heard me. You're using the grey sister angle to get in good with the attendings. I get that. But you're here on my license. So if you do anything,like kill someone,it's on me. So for the rest of the day,you're gonna hug the wall. You're not gonna say anything,you're not gonna do anything. You're an intern. Are welear... three? Lexie. What? It's lexie,or grey. It's not three. I have a name. your blood tests show low electrolyte levels, low calcium and low vitamin D. Have you been dieting? She just lost 40 pounds. Will told me if I ever got back down to a size 4,we'd move in together. How romantic. We both just needed motivation. I told him I wouldn't live with a smoker,so he quit smoking. The problem is,even if dr.Torres is able to repair your fracture, it won't do any good unless you're eating more and working out less. Am I right,dr.Torres? Dr.Tor... hey,are you all right? Uh,uh,.Bailey's right. So what,you're saying that you won't operate unless she puts on a bunch of weight? No,but,um... then why are we still talking about this? We came here to get her leg fixed. So fix her leg. Okay. How'd that discharge- to-hospice patient go? Not great. There was crying and tears and... more tears. Tears? Really? Such a tough old birD. I thought he'd take it like a man. "He'd take it like a man"? What,I'm sexist now? No,"he" as in "him"? Joel hanson in 2212. Not gretchen bitzer in 2213? Oh,dear. I thought that "2" was a "3." Dr.Grey,did you and your intern tell a woman who came in to have her moles removed that she was dying? Oh,dear. I mean,crap. Oh,crap. You hear that? Like a weight room. There's nothing to be scared of. He's been weight training since he was 8 years old. what did I say about you and the wall? Dr.Yang,this is still a teaching hospital,isn't it? yes,sir. You need to get a little closer if you want to learn something today,dr.Grey. Okay,adam,I'm going to attach the tongs now. I need you to stay perfectly still during this procedure. Let the weights do all the work. Okay,you're gonna feel a little pressure, but with the meds we've given you,you shouldn't feel any pain. All right. Here we go. Can you imagine being 14 years old and having some doctor tell you you've got cancer? What do you do with that? Well,you fighT. Camille's a fighter. You two have that in common. So what's it gonna be, stevens gets her bones broken or torres gets taken to the trailer park? Neither. It's not happening. But if it does,will you pull her off me? You gonna tell me what you did to her? You have to promise not to say anything to anybody. Swear. I swear. Jeez. I slept with georgE. I know. I'm a terrible person. Which is why I'm gonna let herget one good punch in. Maybe two. I deserve it. No,one. Then you pull her off me. You slept with o'malley? Alex,you just said you wouldn't say anything. I won't,believe me. This... I'm embarrassed for you. you had one job... one job... read the charts. You want to yell at me some more? You can,because I am an intern and according to dr.Bailey,yelling is how we learn. Well,I'm not a very good yeller. Oh,I'm sure it just takes practice. Perhaps ms.Bitzer will show us how it's done. Just let me do all the talking. Ms.Bitzer... gretchen. She left about an hour ago. She's gone? Left the hospital? Feel like yelling now? Yo C.T.Results showed that not only is the cancer back, it's spread to your chest,lungs and throat. We have options,though. We can operate. We can be even more aggressive with the chemo and radiation than the last time. I just want to go home. We could try to treat you at home,but,camille,you... no,you don't understand. I don't want any treatment. what? camille,don't say that. I've tried,mama. It not working. I can't do it anymore. You can d you will. You have no choice. I'm 18 now,aunt adele. I do have a choice. You may be 18,baby girl, but you are clearly not capable of making life-and-death decisions for yourself right now. Tell her,richard. - Camille... - no,you tell her. Tell her how the radiation almost killed me last time, how I got hepatitis and my kidneys shut down and my skin was so raw I couldn'te touched. - Camille... - I'm dying. We all know that. I don't want to spend what little time I have left in this hospital. I want to spend time with my friends. I want to sleep in my own bed,and I want to be home. So please don't be my doctor right now. Be my uncle who loves me. Let me go home. try not to move your head,adam. I'm...I'm trying,but... I don't know how much longer I can take this. You'll take as much as they give you,son. Okay,now come on! You can do this. It's just another few pounds. - Dr.Yang,maybe we should... - no one asked you. I-I can'T. Please take it off. No,no. Can't quit. Push through it. Okay,just one more plate. Adam,you're strong. You can handle this. Want to be a quitter,do you? Huh,do you? Okay,you know what? That's it. That's it. That's 20 pounds. There,you did it. Right? Told you you could do it. Somebody get him out. Please. Somebody get him out. Adam,I'm just trying to help out. Please get out! Get out! - Get out! Get out! - Adam,adam,calm down. Try not to upset him. - Adam. adam,calm down. - Get...get... Adam,it's o... it's okay. What are you doing? Don't touch him. The slightest movement could... put his hand down,gently. I'm so sorry. I forgot. Now step away from the patient and leave the room. Get out right now or I will throw you out. Dr.Grey,take over for dr.Yang. Dr.Yang,a word. You are a resident now. Your job is to teach interns,not abuse them. I wasn'T. She grabbed his... until you learn to be less competitive and less selfish, you will not assist on my surgeries. You will observe them. - But she... - you can go. Arlene,she's just tired. She doesn't know what she's saying. But she's right. She's not gonna get any better. We don't know that,arlene. There's always a chance. Not if she doesn't get treatment. You've got to talk to her,richard. You've... you have to convince her. She loves yoU. She trusts you. And she's the closest thing we have to a child of our own. Richard,I'm begging you. Please. Save our baby girl. Again,ms.Bitzer,it's very important that you call us back. You idiots still can't find her? I called her home,her cell,her next of kin. I don't care if you have to call every bitzer on the planet. Find her! I am really so very sorry about this. It's not entirely your fault,norman. You're just an intern. I should've double-checked the charts. I was distracted by things I shouldn't be distracted by. For what it's worth,lexie grey is a good girl. She's very sweet. I don't think she would say anything untoward... or uncool. I have bitzers to call. But,you know,you could take the... norman? Norman? I'm not a bad resident,am I? Don't ask me. I lost a patient today. Oh,you killed someone? Lost. Literally can't find. Shepherd says I'm selfish and competitive. What the hell is wrong with that? I kick ass. I'm an excellent resident. I'm not. In addition to losing my patient,I also lost my intern. Turned around,he was gone. Awol. See,what...what is wrong with these interns? We weren't like this. We were great interns. I was great. You were...you were good. - You guys seen callie? - No. Is it time for herto grind your bones into dust? You don't think I can take her? - Are you guys really doing this? - You heard? The whole hospital heard. Yeah,well,that explainsthe line at the salad bar. Well,what are you fighting about? Believe me,you don't want to know. Alex. I'm just saying,whatever it is,it's not worth it. Actually,it is. Some things are worth fighting for. O'malley. Picking up repeat labs for ruthie sayles. So who's your money on,o'malley?Guess you gotta back the wife,huh? What?What are you talking about? The fight downstairs.Torres vs.Stevens. What are they fighting about anyway? Oh,maile,that's just a rumor. It's not happening. Callie is way too mature for that. That's not what my buddy in the cafeteria just said. - o'malley,your labs! - Gotta go!I'll be right back! I'm just saying,I learned how to fight in a trailer park.Okay? Where'd she learn to fight,boarding school?Not quite the same thing. I'm a street fighter. I've got some badass in me. I could take a girl down. izzie. punch with your left.Protect your face with your right. No,your hands... protect your surgeon hands. Your face can heal. Here we go. stevens. Let's do this. Let's go. Let's go. - Go where? - You know,go. I wanted to talk. you want to talk.You don't want to kick my ass? You thought I was gonna fight you?You... that's cr... excuse me. that's a forfeit.Torres forfeits. Oh,my god. You were very ghetto fabulous. Oh,my god. What happened?Was there a fight? no. Guess they realized they were fighting over nothing. Hey,what do you think's a better weekend getaway,napa or sonoma? I hope you don't mind if I kill your girlfriend. Well,first of all,she's not my girlfriend. Second of all,I do mind. Interns should be seen and not heard. They shouldn't talk to patients. That's how they learn. Which means I have to teach, and then I have to deal with their problems when they screw up. Meredith rarely screws up,and she's not an intern. So napa or sonoma,what do you think? - Sonoma. - Mm. Smaller hotels,fewer tourists. And meredith... she's still an intern.Don't kid yourself. She's green,she's a baby,and the only difference between her and that old guy she's got trailing her is that you're not sleeping with the old guy. Sorry I'm late. Well,I was just explaining the surgery. Since your bones have splintered, dr.Torres will place metal plates and screws to hold the ankle together. How long will the recovery time be? It's hard to say. You'll be in a cast 8 to 12 weeks. Three months? Right,dr.Torres? Longer if she doesn't eat. She eats. Not enough to keep her bones from snapping, but you don't seem too concerned about that. - What is your problem,lady? - I don't have paroblem. - I'm not the one who has to live with you. - You know what? - Thiis... you have a problem... - ruthie! in her go ahead. In here. I thought ruthie wasn't going into surgery till tomorrow. That's before she started vomiting blood. She's got a bleeding duodenal ulcer. How did we not see this? She came in with a broken ankle. Her malnutrition and the amount of ibuprofen she's been taking, she's lucky to be alive. why did she do this to herself? 'Cause people are stupid and just want to be loved. That's the only reason anybody does anything. asystole. OK,Start C.P.R. you think he'll walk again? It's not impossible. Mm.We have a bleeder. I need you to cauterize the vein,dr.Grey. Oh,okay. I... I,um... I-I can't find it. I-I-I can't see where it starts.Um... it's coming too quickly. Stop.Suction around it. You have to see where the bleed is coming from first. Follow the flow to the source.Good. Okay,now bovie it. Got it. Good job. Dr.Yang,if you don't mind stepping in? Dr.Grey. Norman,where haveou been? - I was... - norman,do you think you can just cut out on me in the middle of a crisis? - I-I went... - where,norman? Where did you go that was important enough to just disappear in the middle of a shift? - Ms.Bitzer's apartment. - You went to ms.Bitzer's apartment. I told her she had a bill outstanding. - She's right behind me. - Oh. Oh,but if I may say so,your yelling has improved remarkably. Thank you. I-I'm sorry I missed your calls. I didn't mean to cut out on my bill. It's just,I got a lot of living to do and not a lot of time to do it in. - Actually... - I quit my job,dumped my loser boyfriend, told my boss where he could shove it, and bought a one-way ticket to iceland, where the sun never sets,which is fine by me. I'll sleep when I'm dead,right? You're,uh,not going to die,ms. Bitzer. - I'm not? - There was a mix-up with your labs. You're going to live,hopefully a very long,healthy life. I quit my job. I broke up with my boyfriend. I gave up my apartment. you know how hard it is to find an apartment... with parking? I thought you quit smoking. Wasn't that the deal? Ruthie loses 40 pounds,you quit smoking? My girlfriend's in emergency surgery. I think she'll forgive me for smoking. No,no,she won't,because she's dead. Ruthie's dead. Dr.Bailey tried to stop the bleeding, but because she was starving herself and over training, her heart couldn't take the strain. You think this is my fault? She wanted to lose the weight. I just wanted herto be healthy. She was healthy 20 pounds ago. You just wanted her to be hot, - especially if you we gonna move in with her,right? - No,that... - I loved her. - You didn't love her. You just didn't want to be alone or maybe maybe she was good for your ego or... or maybe she made you feel better about your miserable life, but you didn't love her because you don't destroy the person that you love! - Callie! - Get her away from me,man. - Get her away from me. - You gonna hit me?You gonna hit me? Give me any excuse to kick somebody's ass today - because I am dying to! - Don't touch me! dr.Torres! Uh,sir,we are so sorry for your loss. - O'malley,please take... - sir,why don't you come with me? Come on. Okay,I'm gonna ask you one last time,are you all right? I'm fine.It's nothing. Really? 'Cause nothing almost cost you your career just now. The mass we removed from your throat was so big you couldn't breathe. Camille... what took you so long to come in? I knew the cancer wasn't gone. It's never been gone. It's never gonna be gone. And... don't tell my mom,but the truth is... I was hoping it would kill me before I had to come back here. I'm just so tired,uncle richard. I am so,so tired. Camille... what I have here is a plan to keep you alive. It involves 12 oncologists,8 new drugs, six experimental treatments from three different continents. I have no idea if it'll work. But as your uncle... I'm begging you to take it. Because I know for a fact the world... my world... is a better place with you in it. However...as your doctor, I promise to do whatever you want. I just want to go home. Then let's get you home. Callie. Callie,wait.Please,wait. Please. I'm sorry... about the cafeteria. I didn't know that you wanted to talk to me. I thought you wanted to kill me. I'm sorry about everything. With george,I... I'm really sorry. I feel terrible. You feel terrible? You took advantage.He was your best friend.I tried to trust you... so much,I had convinced myself that it was all in my head,that I was crazy. But I wasn't,was I? And then you pull that thing in the cafeteria today? It's not bad enough that you humiliate me by getting in bed with my husband. You have to humiliate me at work,too. George might be the one that broke his vows,but you... we're women,izzie.You did this to another woman. You... took something from me. You stole something from me like a petty little thief. You are the one who should be humiliated. You are the one who should be ashamed. You are the one who should... don't you dare come to me for forgiveness,you traitorous bitch. What,I'm invisible now? What do you want? So you hate me now,too. Well,join the club. You and o'malley? - O'malley! - What? What is it that I did that is so horrifying? I fell in love,alex. - He's married. - Yeah,so? You're carrying a big ol' torch for ava or jane doe or whatever it is that you call her,and she's married. So what gives you the right to judge what I do? Why do you even care? you told me you weren't ready yet... after denny...to be with anyone. And then o'malley?O'malley. And then you tell me like I'm one of your chick friends. Come on. Ms.Bitzer,I just wanted to apologize one more time. Oh,and I just wanted to say thank you,dr.Grey. And,you,too,dr.Shales.Bless you. Bye-bye. - She's not going to sue? - Nope. Our lawyer talked her into settling. Seattle grace just bought that woman four bedrooms and three and a half baths in reykjavíK. - I'm so sorry. - Well,don't tell me. Tell the chief.I'm writing you both up. It wasn't norman's fault.He's my responsibility. I'm the resident.I'm the only one you should write up. That's very noble of you,dr.Grey. Stupid... but noble. Oh. For the record,dr.Grey,I don't think you're stupid at all. I find you... quite smart. What did you say to camille? Adele... I've already lost one baby. And now I have to lose camille? I am not going to use camille to try and make up for the fact that I never gave you children. I never asked you to. I asked you to talk to her,to convince her to... I can't do that... I can't do that,adele. I can give her all the options in the world, but I cannot make her do what I want her to do. I'm her doctor. I thought being a doctor was about saving lives. After all these years of choosing your job over your family, the one time I ask you to do your job to save this family... adele,I'm sorry. I'm truly,truly sorry,but... so am I,richard. callie... you can'T... just forgive me. What I did to you... I-is unforgivable. That's how it works.That's what "I forgive you" means. No,see,I... I think it means you don't forgive me.I... you don't know how to talk to me right noW. I mean,look,you don't...you can't even look at me. You're so angry that... I think the only way you can deal with me is to say you forgive me and... what,we pretend it didn't happen? I... it happened. And you don't forgive me. You're right. I don'T. - So I got alex to cover for me. - Oh. - So I can leave right after I round on my patients. - Yeah. - 48 uninterrupted hours... - yeah,yeah.Um... you know what?Maybe this is not a good weekend. What did lexie say about me? She didn't say anything.I did all the talking. Look,don't blame her. So what,you're friends with my sister now? I mean,you talk to the other grey about me? Mm-hmm. You know what I talked about with the other grey? All the things this grey won't let me say. You can say anything to me. I want to marry you. I want to have kids with you. I want to build us a house. I want to settle down and grow old with you. I want to die when I'm 110 years old in your arms. I don't want 48 uninterrupted hours. I want a lifetime. Mm-hmm. Do you see what happens? I say things like that, and you fight the urge to run in the opposite direction. It's okay. I understand. I didn't,but now I do.I do.. You're just getting started And I've been doing this for a long time. Deep down... you're still an intern. And you're not ready. I'm not ready right now. But things could stay the way they are... And I can get ready.I'll get ready. Things can stay the way they are. We can still meet in the elevator or the on call room. And maybe you'll be ready. And I'll wait. I'll wait until you're ready. Okay,then. Yeah,but what if... what if while I'm waiting I meet someone who is ready to give me what I want from you? What if you do? I don't know. Forgive and forget. That's what they say. I just wanted to say,um,thank you for... saving my ass today in surgery. Well,that's my job,three. Now where are adam's post-op labs? It's good advice,but it's not very practical. I'll get them,dr.Yang. when someone hurts us... we want to hurt them back. Come in. Keep it down,will you? When someone wrongs us,we want to be right. Without forgiveness,old scores are never settled... old wounds never heal. And the most we can hope for is that one day we'll be lucky enough  to forget. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Proudly Presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-
