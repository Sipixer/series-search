So over. Dr. Burke handed in his letter of resignation - two weeks ago. - I was named chief resident. I would've made an excellent chief resident. - We're breaking up. - A breakup kiss. A breakup kiss. I'm lexie. Lexie grey. I'm your sister. Why are you avoiding me? I'm all alone in a forest, all alone in the forest, George. Where are you? I love you, too. In the hospital, we see addiction every day.</i> I feel this, uh, this... this exhalaration. It's like I finally figured it out. You know what it's like? It's like I was sleeping, and it's like I woke up. And it's just... It's just amazing. It's shocking how many kinds of addiction exist.</i> This is the best breakup ever. I don't know why we didn't break up a long time ago. - What are you doing? - Sleeping. - No. No sleepovers. - Yes, please. It's 3:00 in the morning. We agreed. No sleepovers. Broken up people don't sleep over. Sex only. It's the only part of the relationship that works. I know. Why screw it up with everything else? Dinner, conversations. You're mocking my severe emotional limitations. I could live without conversation. I could live without meal or sleepovers. We shouldn't have sleepovers because you snore. But mockery? Mockery, that's the XXX. Okay, sex and mockery it is. It would be too easy if it was just drugs</i> and booze and cigarettes. She said she loved me, and you know, my dad, he c-- Oh, god, he loved her. And you know, when he died then... I shouldn't have gotten married. I think the hardest part of kicking a habit is wanting to kick it.</i> I mean, we get addicted for a reason, right?</i> I thought it was right, but it wasn't. - It's not. - It's not. Often, too often... things that start out as just a normal part of your life</i> at some point cross the line to obsessive...</i> compulsive... - <i>...out of control.</i> - I... I gotta tell her. I have to tell her the marriage is over. It's the right thing to do. Did you see how I walked out of here all determined? It made me proud. It's the high we're chasing, the high that makes everything else...</i> fade away. He loves me, too. - What do you think of the board? - Good. It looks good. - Did a good job. - I didn't do it. I'm delegating. I am being a delegator. I'm doing it all different, making time for my wife. Yeah? She talking to you yet? She will when she sees I'm a delegator. - I should move that surgery up there. - Junkie. Right. It's good. That's fine. Okay. I'm delegating. Being a delegator. - What's wrong with the chief? - He's a junkie. Him? You're the one who looks all strung out. - I'm just tired. - Let me guess. You are back together, and you've been up all night doing the horizontal salsa. Mambo. Horizontal mambo. Meredith and I, we're justriends. Sexy friends? You're the worst, most juvenile human being I've ever met. You know the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem? How many nurses have you slept with this week? That's not a problem, man. That's an adventure. - it is beautiful. - I know. It's a belgian flip round pro. - What do you want? - What do you got? Next time I get a projectile vomiter, I could lose your pager number. You can do better than that. Surgeries, baby. Preferably cardio. Are these all wedding gifts? Yes. She's giving them away. I have dibs on the mixmaster. I'm not giving you the mixmaster. The tradition is you're supposed to return them. Well, burke registered for this crap. Now I'm the one stuck dealing with it. So i'm using it for professional gain. - You're ready to part with this? - She's not. I want it. I am if I can help on the rhomboid flap in your next mohs defect repair. Come to daddy. - You steal this stuff? - Make her give me something. - Give her something. - Give me the mixmaster. Face it. You have nothing I want. Would you look at the residents. Big, snazzy residents, standing around playing with housewares. Turn a blind eye and the soup tureen's yours. Four! Take this mix! Hey! Take the mixmaster and all this crap and put it in my locker. Carnage in the pit. My day's improving. Follow. We're not gonna round? Carnage trumps rounds, three. Write that down. Carnage always trumps rounds. Hey. I know. I never made it home last night. But I got swamped with paperwork and fell asleep in an on call room. I need to talk to you when you have time. I have no time. I'm out of time. This chief resident thing is kicking my ass. Later, then. Tonight, when we're alone? Is it serious? what do we got? A gas main blew in an apartment building. Five injured, some badly. Excellent. Horrible. It's horribl sad. Marla kristler,34-year-old female, abdomen blown out, skull fracture, third-degree burns over at least 40% of her body. Okay, I got this. Open O. R. Two. Page Dr. Shepherd. Torres, triage the rest. Yes, sir. Yang, you're with the chief. - Go. - Oh, thank you. Uh, one, four, come with me. what about us? Uh... go help bailey in the clinic. my wife--she came in in another ambulance.

And pulse are elevated. karev! - I'm supposed to be on plastics. - I'll take it. I called karev. You're with the kristlers. Wh-what about me? oh, you up late last night? You look a little tired. Perhaps you should sit this one out. I'm fine. Not up late. Went to bed early. - hello, mister... - roche. Archie roche. Age 60, second-and third-degree burns over chest and upper abdomen, facial contusions and possible shoulder fracture. One minute I'm reading the sports section, the next I'm flat on my back looking up at a hole in the ceiling right into dave and marla's apartment. These burns should be debrided while he gets worked up. All righT. We'll do a trauma series and shoulder films. - Stevens. - Got it. where's your pain? Just promise me you'll take care of marla and the baby, okay? Are they your family, sir? They might as well be. how close to the explosion was he? Oh, we were, uh, we were in the living room, his mom was in the kitchen. The gas line blew? I-I think it was the stove. All right, we're gonna run some tests on your baby. Kav, I'm going into surgery with the chief. Keep me posted. Marla and david are friends. I was just leaving when the-- when the kitchen blew up. The blast knocked me into a wall. Have you seen this? Grim. You guys look grim. Uh,clark,we need to get a C.T. Internal bleeding? I was on my way to work. um, hey, I need a resident to help me out in the clinic to oversee the new interns while I'm workinon this patient. No, I'm sorry. I can't help. You can't help? The clinic is voluntary, bailey. I'm not gonna force any residents to go in there with this much going on in the pit, but you can have as many interns as you need, okay? And tell Dr. Kent he's gotta find himself another O.R. The chief's taking his. I want the waffle maker. Haven't we already covered this? Yeah, but now I got something you want. Oh, yeah? What? Hello. I'm jane burke. Dr. Burke's mother. How nice to see you. Uh, I'm looking for Dr. Cristina yang. Yang, yang? Let me see. Dr. Yang... I'll page her, but I think she's in surgery. I'll wait. - Waffle maker? - Fine. - What's the 9-1-1? - Mama is here. I'm working with callie. Callie. Gotta find george. - Your mother?What? Mama. Mama is here. Seen george, mer? He's your intern. Oh, burke's mother. Yeah, make the synapses fi a little more quickly, meredith. You know, I was just with a patient. I'd be very happy to go back there. No, no, no. You have to help me. I'll help for the mixmaster and george's current location. - Dr. Yang, you scrubbing in? - Yes, sir. Absolutely. Just get rid of her, okay? Politely. - What? - George! come on, B. It's okay. Brian, stop crying, baby. I can't--I can't think, baby. I'm--why won't he stop crying? Hey there, brian. whoa, you're a big boy. Do you work out, huh? You take care... take care of yourselF. Dr. Karev. C.T. Results. Should I page shepherd? No, he's in surgery. Let me take a look. - What do you see? - Uh, there's nothing acute. Acute? Nothing? Yeah, I'm gonna--I need to run a couple more tests, okay? schedule an M.R.I. - Why? - Because I said so, nancy drew. Just do it. Rooms one and seven are private and should be used for private conversations with patients, not for closed-door socializing. All carts are setup the same. Memorize where everything is. Will we be able to do procedures on our own? No. You are interns. All procedures will be discussed and overseen by an upper level. All charts will be signed out by an upper level. And all patients will be looked at by someone other than you! And what if--ooh! I'm sorry. Uh, I, uh, sorry. What if we can't find anyone? Mrs. Burke. What a surprise to see you here. Are you visiting someone? You're the maid of honor. Miss grey. That's me. When you stood up in front of preston's friends and loved ones and you said," it's over. It's over. It's so over, were you trying to smash the hopes of the best man, or were you just trying to be funny? I-- because making light of that situation would be inappropriate. And to use that moment to send a message to your boyfriend... well, that'S... selfish. So were you being inappropriate, or were you being selfish? I, uh... am, uh... I ologize for that, mrs. Mama, ma'am. I'm just gonna go. Okay. - Miss grey? - Yes, ma'am. When you report back to cristina, would you tell her, please, that i am waiting for her and that I will continue to wait for her? Yes, ma'am. Sorry. Sorry. Any news on marla? My neighboR. I promise, as soon as I hear something, I'll, uh, give you an update. Crap. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry. 3-part proximal humerus fracture. He's gonna need a percutaneous reduction and internal fixation. That boy of theirs--brian-- gorgeous. Sometimes they're not-- kids. Sometimes they're ugly. You ve any kids, doctor? Not that I know of. Not married either, are you? I'm afraid I haven't found anybody who will put up with me. Well, get on the stick. Don't do like I did. Don't be a bachelor your whole life. You can only play the field for so long. Then suddenly one day, your whole life passes you by, and those parts aren't working like they used to. They have medicine for that now. They don't have medicine for that "all alone" part, now do they? No, I suppose not. You got some pretty ones right here. Oh, I'm off the market, Mr. RochE. I--I'm very happily married. I'm really sorry. Sorry. You can't tell her. Wh-- we decided. I'm supposed to tell her. I have to tell her tonight. No, I know. You can'T. You just--you can't, okay? I'm working with her. She's my boss. Damn it! Maybe it'll just work itself out if we wait. You'll grow apart. - Izzie- - she's been working long hours. Maybe she's avoiding you. Maybe she's having an affair. - Izzie- - don't tell her. How long would you suggest I wait until I tell her about us? I don't know. At least until she's not in such a bad mood. A week? A month? I'm sorry. But--well, then, you know, we can't, uh... I know. Then you better walk away. I better walk away. Yeah, I really better walk away. So george has clark in line for his C.T. - Grey. - Yes. - Grey. - Yes. Okay, I need you to work in the clinic, grey. - Well-- - no, no. Before you open your mouth and tell me all the reasons why you can't, just--just let me say this-- i need this, because I have idiots-- you understand me, grey? Idiot interns are down there in my clinic, a clinic dripping with my blood, sweat and tears, grey, and I am not convinced-- not at all convinced-- that they will not burn it down with their ineptitude. Look, no, I'm not telling,'cause I-I understand I do not have the authority to tell. So I'm asking... nicely. Okay, I'm just saying, if I ever did anything for you, like, I don't know, save your life... if you ever felt you owed me a debt of thanks, now is when I'd like to collect. Please. Oh, no. Hey, are you working down hertoday? - Uh, I don't, um, know. - Great. Well, we have no idea what we're doing. Plus, I was really hoping we'd get a chance to speak. So... yay. Yay. I can't believe this. This is surreal. - You claustrophobic? - No, I'm not claustrophobic. It's just, I was on my way to work, you know? I was on my way to work and i stopped at a friend's house, and the next thing you know, I'm in a cat scan machine. It's like... how did this happen? Dr. Karev. lab work? it's crazy, isn't it? Stay here. Stay in this room and do not leave. Do not leave that man alone with that child. *** Dr. Yang, was that Dr. Burke's mother I saw in the waiting room earlier? Mrs. Burke is here? I don't think-- I wouldn't know, sir. Okay. How are we doing up there, shepherd? Good. She looks good from my end. That's the best part about the job, don't you think? Giving good people second chances. Believe me, I know. I get it. But, you know, it's life. It happens. You know, you're going down one path, and all of a sudden, then you realize, like, oh, no, no, no, this is the-- this the wrong path. This is... no, this isn't the path for me. And--and it's-- and it's good because you learn and you realize that you can handle it. And you can. You can handle this. You... Clark. Clark! Clar--code blue. We need a crash cart in here. Chief. The 1 year old-- brian kristler? He's strung out on meth. - What? - Yeah, it was a meth lab that blew up. This woman and her husband are running a meth lab. Oh. clear. ***The joys of surgeondom. Saving the lives for those who deserve it the most. Tell Dr. Torres to follow exposure protocol for children. Tell her I am counting on her to take care of this. Got it sure you don't want page somebody to take over so you can go handle that? I'm trying to get back with my wife, derek. In order to get back with my wife, I have to learn how to-- delegate. Dr. Torres can handle this. - They were shooting him up with- - no, they weren't shooting him up. When you cook meth, the fumes, they coat the walls, the floors. The baby walks around, crawls around, puts its hands in its mouth, it gets in his bloodstream. God. Okay, um, call the police and social services. I'll spread the word. Wait, what about the dad? He's still in therewith the kid. You call the police and social services. You let them take care of the dad. You take care of the baby. Sloan. We got a situation. You're doing a fine job. You were acting awfully odd before, had me a little nervous, but-- Mr. Roche, I'm gonna ask you a question. I don't want you to be offended by it, but the answer could affect your surgery. Fine. Fire away. Are you a crystal meth user? You're kidding, right? He's, like,60. No judgment, sir. All I need's a yes or no answer. Crystal what? It's a drug, sir. Um, it's addictive and very dangerous. Well, unless you put it in my blood pressure medicine, I - I never touched the stuff. What's going on? The kristlers had a meth lab in their apartment. It's what caused the explosion. Marla and dave had a drug lab in their apartment? No. Impossible. Absolutely not. I've known those two for five--five years. We go on picnics, to ball games. I babysit for them. I babysit for drug dealers? o'malley! what happened? - He coded. - He coded? Coded, out of nowhere. Heart stopped. Coded. - Probably a drug addict. - What? That's what I came here to tell you. That fire that he was in, it was a meth lab explosion. He could have cardiomyopathy from meth usE. That would explain it. Oh... it's a miracle I got him back. Wait, you ran the code yourself? Where's grey? She's covering in the clinic. What the hell is she doing in the clinic? I thought I told you to take interns. I didn't want interns. Sorry about that. Some things, o'malley, some things just don't need to be told. How about here? Does it hurt here? Weird. It feels weird? No. That lady is staring at me... or my fat. Oh, don't worry. She's staring at me. I'll be right back, okay? well? How'd surgery go on the mom? Yeah, she'll live. Whatever. Oh, I tried. I trieD. Mama is not budging, and she is very scary. Yeah, obviously. What does she want? Did burke send her? I don't know. I mean, you have to go. You have to go deal with mama. Just go get it over with and then when you're done, come back and tell me all about it because I could really use a pick-me-up. Okay, mama showdown is not for your enjoyment. Besides, my patient is stable and until I'm paged, I'm gonna stay right here. - she keeps staring at us. - I know. Make her stop. - You make her stop. - You're her sister. I'm an only child. You're her resident. if you have time to stare, you have time to get me coffee, so move, move, move. Two, stay. Now see? If you could just do that with mama... mrS. Burke! I don't think I know you. I'm george o'malley. I'm a friend of burke'S. I was burke's guy. Hi, george o'malley-- burke's friend, burke's guy. Please sit. I guess I have a minute. You know one time he let me live on his sofa when I had no place else to stay? How is he? Is he... okay? He's preston. He's a gentleman. And so... he doesn't lik to talk about it. And I just really don't know what to say to him. Maybe, uh... I don't know. Maybe you can tell him that he dodged a bullet. I mean, marriage is... once you're in, you're in. Burke is smart, you know? He didn't make a mistake. 'Cause it's a mistake that, you know, it's hard to take back. Which, even if you want to take it back, you can't. So you can tell him that. Once you're in, you're in. Make sure you have that engraved on your wedding ring when you get married. Oh, I'm already married. You're already married? George o'malley-- burke's friend, burke's guy-- staying in a marriage out of obligation? That's no way to live. That's no way to love. But I think you know that. I do. Sometimes I do. Oh, your timing could not have been more perfect. Where are we going? What do you mean, where are we going? You paged me, right? - I did. - Good. So on call room? You know, I was thinking maybe we could, uh, go to the cafeteria. Thought you might be hungry. Why are you looking at me like that? Derek, we agreed-- "s" and "m" only. - "S" and "m"? - Sex and mockery. Right,"s" and "M. - So you're eating lunch? - I am. - Want to come? - No. Meet me in the lobby at 8:00. - And eat your dinner first. - Yeah, great. Perfect. that's a really big needle, man. Do you have to use such a big needle? His I.V. Came out,and he needs to be hydrated. - Okay, okay. Look, I'm-- shh. -it's all right Look, I'm just--I'm freaking out a little bit here. I mean, do you think you could get me an update on my wife? Your wife has a crater in her abdomen, so even if she does survive surgery, it's gonna be a long, hard, painful recovery. she's gonna be okay, right? I mean, she's gotta be okay. Wh--brian, please, sweetheart, look at me. Brian, okay, stop crying. Brian, please. Brian, stop crying! He can't stop crying! okay? He can't stop crying because his nervous system is shot. He can't stop crying because his brain and his heart and his renal system are all compromised. He can't stop crying because he's in withdrawal from crystal meth, you son of a bitch. no, no. That's impossible. He wasn't in the room when we were making it. It was all over your apartment, okay? I tested him'ause i smelled it on his skin. I love my son. Okay, we--we were broke. I lost my job. And I'm a good dad, and I love my family. Well, now you can love your family from jail. I'm sorry. Dr. Torres. - Yeah, chief. - Yeah, chief"? Is it that you don't know what's going on in my hospital, Dr. Torres, or that you don't care? Um, I'm sorry. I guess I don't know. I delegated the meth lab situation to you. And now one of youresidents has been attacked and a baby is missing. I don't understand. I told karev to take-- I don't want to hear any of your excuses. Finish up here. You better hope that baby shows up. I think you're a good chief resident. what? I know--I know that you've been having a hard time with it, and--and this thing with the baby... clearly it's not an easy job, and I think you're doing a good job at it. I can take it from here. - What? - Get out of my O.R.,Stevens. Now! So the happy little family makes meth. There's no such thing as a happy family. What's with her? Well, mama burke is here, and we don't know why. My guess is that she's here to kill cristina. She's hovering again. If you're done with the charts, go fold something, like, you know, sheets. What are you lookin'at? Don't look at her. Your sister. She's hot. I'm an only child. don't talk to me about lexie. Oh, the police want to talk to me. You know, all I want to know is why she's herE. Is that too much to ask? he's not returning my phone calls anymore. He's doing his best. Do you think... do you think she really loved him-- cristina? I-I think she loved him the best that she knew how. And that would not have been enough for you either? No. It wouldn't have been enough for me either. So you would've ended it, too? Well... burke and I are-- are built differently. He's stronger than I am. He was strong enough to... and, um, we're not built the same. honorable men are all built the same. And you think I'm an honorable man? Do you know when to walk away? Do you know when not to take less than you deserve? If you do, then you're an honorable man. When you got injured in the fire, the shock to your body combined with the drugs and the damage-- your heart seized up, and you went into cardiac arrest. You're also bleeding internally, so you need to stay for observation, which means that you are probably about to go into withdrawal. But you can't leave because it is still quite possible that you'll need surgery. You got any good news, Dr. O'malley? I wish I could say yes. Come on. Where are you? Damn it! How's the surgery on the old guy? Fine. Callie? Damn it. I can't talk right now. I have to find a baby. Are you okay? A baby was lost... on my watch. I am chief resident. I am responsible. And the chief, he gave this to me, and I blew it. And--and now a baby's missing. So no, I'm not okay. No. No, you are not okay. Plus, I think... I think my husband's having an affair. well, if that's true, he's an idiot. and if that's true, you need to talk to him. You know, as an alternative to destroying your career. Um, Dr. Grey... I was wondering, do you know where the thermometers are?'Cause-- do you really not know where the thermometers are, lexie? Or are you just looking for an excuse to talk to me? I-- simple question, lexie. Are you an idiot or a stalker? Okay. that was a mean thing to say. I'm aware of that because I'm generally not a me but I'm a person who just doesn't want to know you. And you are a person who's making that very difficult. So please, just stop making it so difficult for me to not know you. Okay? brian, oh, my god. Please, wake up, baby. Please. Mr. Kristler. He won't wake up. He was shaking, and then he just--he just-- he won't wake up. Let me take him, Mr. Kristler. No, I love my baby. I don't want to leave my baby. It sounds like he had a seizure. - Okay, please let me- - I don't want to go to jail. You don't want him to die, so if you love him, please let me take him. I'm sorry! Let me take him. Baby, please. **a stroke. You can yell, you know? Not my job anymore. I'm just saying, you can if you want. I-I deserve it. Oh, you do deserve it. You do deserve, Dr. Karev, to be chastised for your stunningly poor decision making. You--you've certainly earned a-a reprimand for your unbelievably destructive tactical error. You got in the face of a drug dealer? You got in the face of a drug dealer before the police had arri-- you got in the face of a known felon while his 1-year-old child was still in the room? Are you stupid? Are you without intelligence? Because I know you were taught better than that. I taught you better than that, Dr. Karev. Gettin'in the face of a drug dealer. Fool. Thank you. Oh, no. Thank you. I am nice person. Okay, I-I am. And... i don't know what it is that I did to you, but, you know, we have the same dad. So I was just thinking that a simple conversation-- we don't have the same dad, lexie. You and I, we do not have the same dad. My dad disappeared when I was 5 years old, and I never saw him again. Does that sound like the daddy you grew up with? I cked a man out of my bed in the middle of the night-- the world's most perfect man, who loves me, and I can't let him. And it doesn't take a shrink to figure out why. Because our dad chose you. So I'm sure you are a very nice girl, lexie. But I hope you can understand, you're not a girl I ever wanted to have to know. I never even tried drugs until I was 30. Stupid. I'm so stupid. I went to a party, and there was all this-- this meth floating around and... I just figured, what the heck? Once won't kill you. And then-- and then it's more than once, then it's all you can think about, and then-- then you're outside your dealer's house at 7:00 in the morning. This isn't me. It--it isn'T. I'm not this guy. I'm--I'm not this guy. I'm not this guy. clark? hello. It took you long enough. Yes. I came for preston's key. I'd like to pick up some of his things and the necklace I ge you for the weddinG. Of--of course. just, uh, leave it under the mat when you're ne. And I wanted to say I'm sorry. I... I've come to know you, I think. And what you love even more than preston is being a surgeon. You are planning to continue with cardiothoracic surgy like my son, am I correct? Yes. So I'm sorry you lost the man you love. But more than that, I'm sorry you lost your teacher. With him by your side... you could've become a brilliant heart surgeon. I see. You're a strong woman, cristina. I respect that. I wish I could've been born at another time. I might be more like you. So I shall leave the key under the mat. Uh, can you take the gifts? There are all these wedding gifts, and I can'T... can you--can you please take them away? Of course I can. He's never coming back, is he? Not even to say good-bye. Remember... you're a strong woman. His heart couldn't take it. There was just too much damage. He couldn't take it. I'm not this guy. I won't be this guy who... I'm going to tell her. oh, chief. I, uh-- I've got paperwork, Dr. Torres. Kidnapd babies make for a lot of paperwork. I was planning on maybe going to see my wife tonight. But instead, I get to do this. I could help. I mean, I-I could-- I could help. No, you've helped enough for one day. What... h-how did I get... you were cooking crystal meth and the substances exploded. Where's--where's my-- your husband and your son, u sustained only minor injuries. Althought seems, um, your son had been passively ingesting methamphetamine. He suffered a stroke earlier today and went into surgery this afternoon. I believe the surgery went smoothly. Your husband was taken by the police, and I'm sure they'll be wanting to speak to you as well. oh, okay. Okay, you know what? Just try--try to breathe. Slowly. Slowly. Breathe. I'm sure it must feel... as though everything is coming apart. But you can get through this. Just... breathe. breathe. The thing about addiction is it never ends well. Because eventually whatever it is that was getting us high... stops feeling good and starts to hurt. wa to grab a drink? I have a problem. What's up? No, I'm just... I'm admitting I... I have a problem. What's gonna happen to them and the baby? Um... his grandmother is coming fohim. I think she's gonna take custody. they were it. They were my family. Can you imagine? After 60 years on this planet... my family's a couple of drug dealers and their kid. You know, just because people do horrible things, it doesn't always mean they're horrible people.
