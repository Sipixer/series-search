No hits from missing persons, plus-- My face is hard to identify. Anyone know who the new chief candidate is? - Colin Marlowe. - The one and only. - He... - Yes. - With... - Yes. Your best friend violently disses our marriage every chance she gets... She has feelings for you! Is she crazy? Surgeons always have a plan... Where to cut, where to clamp, where to stitch. But even with the best plans... Complications can arise, things can go wrong... And suddenly you're caught with your pants down.</i> Wow. You and George were really going at it last night. - What? - Oh, the laughing, the drinking, the music-- Okay, you know what? Nobody, meaning me, needs to hear George's rendition of "Sexy Back" at 3:00 in the morning. Yeah. You shoulda-- You shoulda just, you know, said something or-- or... Banged on the wall. It's like living in a youth hostel. Well, the important thing is, is that she and George made up. You did, right? I need to use your bathroom. - Why? - Because O'Malley is puking in mine. - Okay, youth hostel. - George is still here? Yes. Yes, but only because he was too drunk to drive home. You know, just totally impaired, like no-heavy-machinery drunk. What's her problem? Still drunk. What's she doing here? She's afraid she's ruining her engagement to Burke, so she's hiding from him. Not anymore. I have a plan. Burke doesn't want me to marry him just to appease him-- - Which you are-- - So... we don't get married. Simple. We go back to the way it was. "Be kind. Rewind." My plan has a name. I gotta go. Gotta get to work. I'll see you guys there. Is that George? You said he was upstairs puking. So now he's downstairs puking. What the hell happened last night? Callie is gonna kill me. Did I at least call her before I passed out? You don't... You don't remember? I remember the bourbon... And, uh... I don't... Where did you sleep? - Big day. - Yeah. What time's your interview with the board? 3:00. Well, if you have any questions, please-- Yes, thank you. I think I have everything well in hand. That's a big folder. It's, uh, it's nothing. It's, uh, just a few ideas I have for Seattle Grace. A 10-year plan, which, uh, really is just a few... tweaks. What did, uh, Einstein say? "Newton did the work, "I'm merely standing on his shoulders." And in this scenario, I'm Newton. - Hey. - Hey. - You look nice. - I look insane. I'm-- I'm wearing pearls. - Listen-- - Listen, about, uh, last night-- - Yeah. - Yeah, I had-- we're gonna have to put a pin in that for now, because as of this moment, You and I are the perfect couple. Okay? We are the perfect, happily married couple who are perfect and-- And never fight, because, uh, because my dad's in town. - What? - Yeah. My dad is in town, and, uh, he wants to meet my husband. Oh, hey. The O'Malleys. Carry on. Do your stuff, your... married stuff. Yay! You told her about our fight? Just when exactly is he coming? Today. Lunch. Cafeteria. You know what, I think I'm gonna change it to Joe's so he might not be able to tell that stink's coming from you. No, it's-- It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Uh, I'm good with parents. Parents love me. Funny, funny, funny little man. Funny little smelly little man. Get in the shower, OK? - It's gonna be OK. - Get in the shower. I know. You'll see. He's gonna love me. Oh! No. What's this? We bring each other coffee. This is what we do. No, it's what we used to do, before you moved in. We started making coffee at home. You know, I'm not really interested in going back to the way it used to be. So unless you have something else to say to me... I've already had my coffee. Good morning, Doctors. Good morning. Big day today, huh? Good luck to all and sundry, hey? He has a 10-year plan. - What? - He's presenting the board with a 10-year plan for the surgical wing. He's only been here a day. Did you see that folder? It's full of plans, "tweaks" for my hospital... This is our computer-generated approximation of your original facial structure based on the 3-D C.T. scans we did. It's what you could look like after reconstructive surgery. Or you could look like this. Or this. You don't like them? No, it's not that. It's... How does this work exactly? He'll make an incision along your hairline, and then... It's okay. I can take it. He'll literally pull your face off. It sounds a lot worse than it is. Your face is extremely elastic, and pulling it down allows me to repair the bone fractures underneath without causing any scaring. And once you've healed, no one will ever know you had the surgery. I'm that good. He is. It's annoying. The surgery won't affect my baby? I'll be monitoring the baby throughout. So... Then I-I just have to pick one? Do I have to pick one now? Um, take a couple hours and think about it. Couple hours... yeah. - Dr. Bailey. - Chief, our Jane Doe is getting a new face today. Well, that's exciting. How are you doing, Meredith? You didn't take too much time off after-- I'm fine. Really, sir. I, uh, I think working is the best thing I can do. Like mother, like daughter? Dr. Grey, what can you tell me about reconstructing the orbital floor? Uh, you can create a new base for the eye socket by harvesting bone from the skull. Dr. Bailey, Dr. Grey will be scrubbing in on the Jane Doe surgery. Come on. I'll show you how to do it without breaking the bone graft into a million pieces. Congratulations, Dr. Grey. Okay, let's go, people. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I need to talk to you. Why? To prepare you guys for what you're about to see. You meant-- You meant "you" like "us", not like "me". You don't want to talk to me, you want to talk to us about a p-- About a patient. That's what I just said. Uh, this patient has a disease so rare that you'll probably never see it again-- - F.O.P. - Oh, uh, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva? Yeah. It's a congenital disease which turns muscle into bone. You become a human statue. So just, uh, try to learn. Try not to stare, okay? If you people are interns, you need to stand back. Nina, please don't be rude. My mother still has movement in her... face and hands. I would like to keep it that way, so please be careful... If you press too hard during an exam or bump into her accidentally, it causes a bone to grow where a bone shouldn't grow. So there can be no accidents. Remember that when you're dealing with her today... It's just a stomach virus or a flu. I'm sure it's nothing. Nina insisted - that I come in. - She was vomiting blood and going through her pain meds like they were candy. And she has new growths on her back, no doubt caused by some clumsy interns on her last hospital stay. Well, obviously you're having a flare-up of the F.O.P., but what really concerns me is the vomiting. So I'm gonna need a C.T., see what's going on. Wow. Did you build that? - My mom did. - No, Nina did it. I used to do, I-I'm not able to. It keeps her active. When she's active, she has fewer flare-ups. Plus it makes her happy... And relaxed. Good. Okay. Can I work in the clinic today? You don't want the F.O.P. case? Clinic, why? What's going on in the clinic? Nothing. I just feel clinic-y. That's not a word. I'll take the clinic. You both can go to the clinic. The board is interviewing the chief candidates all day today, so we're light on surgeries. Yes? You're with Dr. O'Malley. What am I supposed to do? Find Dr. Montgomery. See if you can help with Jane Doe. I showered twice. It's coming out of your pores, George. You reek, you're trembling, there's no way I'm letting you near my patient right now. - Dr. Bailey. - Don't tell Bailey. Bailey, with Mrs. Rogerson's limited mobility, I'm gonna, uh, need an extra set of hands. Fine. Yang will handle the clinic. You'll be with the O'Malleys today. It's my foot. It hurts like crazy. I'm gonna need a painkiller. Can't spend the whole day propped on an ice pack. Uh, you're gonna need to take off your shoe. No, no, no, no. I've been down this route before. Just slip me a couple painkillers, and I'll be on my way. Sir, uh, did you go to medicalchool? I did. Take off your shoe. You have type 2 diabetes. Ten years now. You inspect your feet every day. Have you noticed anything? I notice it hurts. Look, I got 30 guys sitting on their ass waiting for me to show up. Sir, I get it. You're in a hurry. That makes the two of us. Sock. You need to call your guys and tell them you're not coming in. Did you choose a face? Not yet. I was hoping I'd see one of 'em, and, I don't know, recognize myself or something, but... I don't recognize any of these women. What if I choose the wrong one? What if my husband or boyfriend or whoever's... baby this is shows up tomorrow with a-- With a picture of what I'm supposed to look like, but it's too late, and I'm stuck with the wrong face for the rest of my life? Okay, that would suck, but if you don't pick one... This is gonna be your face the rest of your life. Shouldn't you be preparing for your board interview? I am. You're hovering. No, I'm breathing you in. You're hovering. Fine. I'm hovering. If Cristina would sleep in her own bed, I wouldn't have to hover at work. I could hover in bed. A different type of hovering perhaps. How bad is it today, on a scale of one to ten? - Seven. Maybe a six. - Good. You know what's gonna make it even better than that? - What? - The calvarial bone harvest I get to do on Sloan's Jane Doe later. Sloan's gonna let you do a harvest.. - By yourself? - By myself. Which makes me very cool in the eyes of my dead mother, by the way. Okay, then. Well, I better let you study. Better stop distracting me. I will not be cool in the eyes of my dead mother if I maim Jane Doe. We're gonna need you to lie very still, Mrs. Rogerson. I think I can do that, Dr. O'Malley. Sorry about that, Mrs. Rogerson. I'm never gonna drink again. I can't believe I have to be presentable for Callie's dad at lunch. Oh, god. Hours-- Hours of our lives-- Many hours that are all I can think about, and you seriously don't remember? How can you not remember those many, many hours? Let-- Izzie, if... Whatever I did, whatever I said, I was drunk. I'm sure I didn't mean it. George, I promise you, you meant it. You meant it a lot. You meant it more than once. Do you see that? Gotta page Callie. You'll be pleased to hear I'm proposing an expansion to the hospital board this afternoon. Give you quite a few more places to hide. I'm not going to hide. I'm just trying to find my resident. I come here to Seattle to see you, and you don't even give me a moment? You didn't come to see me. You came to get a job. - I came here for both. - Well, you made a mistake. Are you going to invite me? - Where? - To the wedding. Will you stop talking about the wedding? Most blushing brides to be love to talk about the wedding. What the matter? Are we getting cold feet? Please leave. If he's rushing you, you should tell him. When you marry, you want to be ready. He should understand that. Good afternoon, board. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen... of the board. I am so grateful for this opportunity. Don't wear the glasses. You fiddle with 'em. It makes you look indecisive. And stop stressing. It'll be like any other job interview. "What do you consider your strengths? What do you consider your weaknesses?" What do you consider your weaknesses? I don't have any. I'm that good. What are yours? I'm an easy Mark for evil redheads. Trust me, you have other weaknesses. Obviously... you are a man-whore. Correction. I was a man-whore. Yeah, while you're bragging about that to the board, Colin Marlowe is pitching his 10-year plan. 10-year plan? Was that a requirement? It is now. Mrs. Rogerson, according to your C.T., you have severe internal bleeding. It was probably caused by your anti-inflammatory medication. Does that require surgery? Because she can't have any-- Obviously any surgical procedure could cause more bone growth or do more damage than good. That's why Dr. Burke's here. What we can do is insert a line into your groin and then float a catheter up and embolize the area. That's minimally invasive? As minimally invasive as possible. But with your condition, even this is risky. I'm 41 years old. Most F.O.P. patients don't live to 45. I'm down to the use of my face and hands. Pretty soon I won't have anything. So what would happen... If I refuse the surgery? You will bleed to death... Within a day or two. Is that painful? - Mom, stop, okay? - Nina, please. - Let me think. - The reason you've gotten this far-- Our treatment plan works. It will work. Burke is using powerpoint. He's doing a powerpoint presentation for the board, which is... cool if it's, like, 1998. There's no swag, is there? We're not allowed to give gifts? Why did you ask Meredith to do a bone graft on your Jane Doe? Because I'm her teacher, and that's my job. You're doing it to impress the chief. You're setting her up, and she can't fail right now. Why don't you let your girlfriend decide what she can or can't do? I will hurt you if this goes wrong for her. Is that a... dollhouse? Yeah. The lights work and everything. It's the perfect little home. Did you have a dollhouse growing up? I had sex last night... with the wrong person. But the thing is, it didn't feel wrong at the time. It felt like... Something's falling into place. So what do I do? What am I, the go-to person for adultery? I just... I just don't know what to do. You stop. That's what you do. Are you sure? I mean, how do you know that it didn't feel so right because... it's god's plan? God wants you to be an adulter? God got a virgin pregnant by magic. God is not playing by the rules. Uh, talk to paul. Mr. Kendry. No, Paul will get you drywall numbers. - Mr. Kendry. - Okay. Let me just write a couple notes about that call. Mr. Kendry, we're gonna have to amputate your foot. - What? - The infection is in the bone. If we don't remove the foot, it will travel to your blood, and that will cause sepsis and possible death. I'm sorry. How can you be so... I mean, I-I can't get around a... No, no, no, no, no. No, no. You're not cutting off my foot. Sir, diabetes is a manageable disease. If you had been here even a month ago, - maybe we-- - Okay, so I screwed up. But you're telling me that this is my only option because I'm late getting in here? - That there is no way-- - Mr. Kendry-- Please. There's gotta be a way for me to get that month back. Tell me what to do. I'll do it. I'll do every line of every plan you give me. I'll do it. Please. You gotta find a way to save my foot. What do you think of a robotics lab as a goal for the hospital? - Derek... - You're harvesting. I'm trying to be supportive but this graft, it's really tricky. You don't have to do it, you know. I talked to Mark, and, uh-- You what? I talked to Mark. I mean, Meredith, this is a-- - It's a complex procedure. - You don't think I can do it? When has Mark Sloan, allowed his interns to do anything, let alone harvest a bone graft? He's in the race for chief. - He's trying to prove he can teach. - By teaching you.. Your mother died, the chief is gonna be watching you very closely. And Mark is trying to gain points by-- Using me. If it goes well, he gets the credit. If it goes poorly, he gets the save. So this is about you onupping Mark. He's using you. I'm just trying to protect you. You don't need to. Close the door on your way out... - Can I help you with those, Dr. Bailey? - What do you want? See, that's what I like about you. You always get right to the point. Make it quick. I'm headed over to the clinic. All right. What would you change about this hospital if you could? Is this for your board interview? You want me to do your homework for you because I'm not busy enough, is that it? All the other attendings are putting together 10-year plans. I was... just looking for some input. Input? You want-- I have patients in need of medical attention right now. This guy here is about to have one less appendage. I don't have a 10-year plan for him. I have a "right now" plan for him-- Cut off his foot to save his life. So you need to get out of my way right now so I can do my job. - Right now? - Right now. Talk to me about blackouts. Are they real? Do you really not remember anything afterwards? Iz, I'm fine. Not drinking. I'm not drowning my sorrows. Fine. Everybody needs to stop trying to protect me. Um, this isn't... really about you. I'm asking, back when you had a best friend named tequila, did you... actually ever blackout? Once. No, twice. But the stuff you don't remember is usually the stuff you don't wanna remember. Right. Great. Thanks. Hey, I have type 2 diabetes. Patient let it go, and the infection is in the bone. I have to find a fix or cut off the foot. Anyone? Anybody? You get to cut off his foot? Cool. You think-- No, not cool. The patient was neglectful. He made a couple of bad calls. Does that mean he has no hope? Does that mean he can't have a do over? But you get to cut through bone and stuff. We're talking about Burke now. We are? Operation "Be kind. Rewind." not going so well? You need to fix it. Cause it seems like you guys have a pretty good thing, and pretty good things are rare, and hard to come by, unlike really screwed up, complicated things, which... seem to be freakin' everywhere. You know what? Things are great. I'm gonna get things back to the way we were. Watch me. Has Jane Doe picked a face? No, not yet. How cool would that be, to get to pick your own face, just... disappear and start all over? How you doing? How am I doing? I'm freaking out, Alex... That's how I'm doing. I can't do this. I can't pick. I can't. All right. Well, let's, uh... Let's meet the contenders, all right? Let's see. This... This is... Maggie. Married her high school sweetheart, has two kids-- Boy and girl... Loves being a mom, coaches her daughter's basketball team and... makes an insane bana cream pie. Bana cream pie? It's my favorite, so shut up. And this is... um... Elizabeth. Graduated from Northwestern. Met her husband at a political rally where they... got arrested and fell in love. She's all angry and fired up, but everyone forgives her because she means well. This one... This one's Ava. She's funny, she's tough. You know, little neurotic sometimes, but you get used to it. You can tell she's-- She's been through a lot in her life, but... It's only made her stronger, you know? It's just, your daughter, the way she... You know, she's sort of undeniable. And, uh, after I lost my father, I... realized, you know, that life is short. And it's-- It's long, too.... Short and long... Life.... He talks a lot. No, no. He-- He-- He talks. Like a-- Like a-- Like a person who talks, dad. - Please. - Do you have any idea what you've done to your mother? You make this decision, the most important day of your life... We didn't even know she was seeing someone... Are you pregnant? - Did you get my daughter pregnant? - No. Daddy. No, it is not-- No. This is George, okay? He's not like the other guys I've been with. Clean as a whistle, and a mathlete. He has no money. - You have money. - Oh, come on... I didn't know that Callie was well-off. - She just told me. - Really? Really? Well, then, you won't mind if the house, the car and everything else we'll provide will be in Calliope's name. - Uh, what house? - You're a married woman now. I'll find something suitable. It's all here in the postnuptial i've drawn up. - Dad! - Sorry. I've got it. It's all right. It's okay. You know what? You-- You are not drawing up any... - ...you can raise a family. - No! - What? - No, that's not gonna happen. There's no way I'm gonna let you pay for anything. I can't-- We can't, uh... Callie, I'm so sorry. Mr. Torres, I'm sorry, but the answer is no. You remembered. That's really coming along. It looks great. Thanks. We've been working on it for months. But when I say "we", I mean "she". I just hold things and look pretty. That can be hard work, too. I'm gonna need to draw some blood for, uh, your surgery. Be careful. You can only use one specific vein. In this area here. - I said be careful. - I'm so sorry. That's okay. I's not. If she gonna be that clumsy, she's not drawing your blood. Nina, she's just doing her job. Not very well. I'm going to get a nurse, a senior nurse. - Oh, Nina, stop. - No, mom. Do not let her touch you. We can't be too careful. You're not taking her blood. She's not even a person anymore. You know what I mean? - Mrs. Rogerson-- - I know I'm gonna die. You know, maybe not today, but soon.. I just need to talk, you know? Nina won't let me talk. I just need to talk. No coffee. One more thing for marlowe to tweak... Please tell me you're not coming up with a 10-year plan for this hospital. You can me up with all the plans you want, but in the end, it just... Doesn't make one bit of difference. - Things happen. People just-- - Drown? You know, when I pulled her out of the water, it was... She was like ice. She can swim. Richard, she's... She gave up. I close my eyes for a moment, it's like she's back in the water. I'm up, and I just listen to her breathe, you know? Just... In case she stops. So I can come up with plans for the hospital, but... But if they ask me where I'm gonna be in ten years... George. Mr. Torres. You want to take care of her in your own way. I understand that. I respect it. But you have to understand, she's my only little girl, George. And you need to promise me that you will love her and protect her, because the minute that you hurt her... You understand? Good. Then I'll tell Callie's mother she can plan the party. What pa-- What? - Your wedding party. - Oh, dad. Oh, no, please, <i>mija.</i> For my sanity, <i>mija</i>, just let her plan a party. All right, all right. Okay. All right. I have a plane to catch. Come here. George. Bye, dad. You stood up to him. Nobody does that. I was all proud. So listen... About last night, I don't know about you, but personally, I'd like to take back about 90% of it. Me, too. Good. Good. Okay. Then go-- Go find Izzie and help her prep Mrs. Rogerson. I'll see you in surgery. You here to keep my baby alive? I am. Good. So? So... Call me Ava. You been practicing? You know the chief will be watching today. The chief. Right. Of course. "Of course" what? Derek was right about you. You're using the memory of my dead mother to win points with the chief. It's despicable, and I'm not gonna play. The chief-- The way he was looking at you this morning-- Was like you were some beaten down puppy he picked up off the side of the road. You do this procedure and you do it well, he'll start looking at you like a surgeon again. But, you know... You wanna think of me as despicable, you wanna pass up this shot, that's up to you. They're doing a-amazing things with prosthetics these days. This doesn't mean your life is over. Uh, take him up to the O.R. I'll meet you there. You've got your board thing now? The chief picked you... Originally. You were always supposed to be the next chief. That was the plan. That was a long time ago. A lot has happened since then. But you're still that guy. You're the guy the chief chose. No, I'm not. I'm not that guy, Cristina, and I wouldn't want to be. I want to be better than that. I'd like to believe that I've grown. I want to move forward. I'm not interested in going back. Dr. Burke. You ready? Osteotome and hammer. All right, use the curved osteotome to elevate the external table. Gently. - How's it looking? - Still see bleeding. The platinum microcoils-- They aren't holding. What about using a gelatin sponge? I've already tried polyvinyl alcohol, glue, microcoils-- Nothing's working. B.P.'s dropping to 62 systolic. We'll have to open her up. If you open her up, she's dead. If we don't, she's dead. Beginning amputation. Fine amputation, Yang. Beautiful. Wait. - Now they're laughing. - Laughing? They're laughing. They can't be laughing with him. They have to be laughing at him. I'm surprised you don't have a shot glass pressed up against that window. - We weren't listening. - Just listening. Let me show you the new clinic. Chief. So? If you ask me, you all could stand to borrow a page from Dr. Sloan's book. Sloan? You're kidding right? That's a joke? He didn't get caught up in this whole 10-year plan foolishness. He said he had a "right now" plan for Seattle Grace. A right now plan? A right now plan? Is that right? The board ate it up. To tell you the truth, so did I. I should've brought her in sooner... The first time she threw up. I knew better. - There was nothing any of us could-- - No. It was a mistake. Your mother... talked to me. She wasn't ready to leave you, but she was ready to leave her body. Please. I don't need you to explain the relative comforts of death for my mother. What she was afraid of... was that you had taken on so much of her disease that you were freezing up, too. You've spent so much time planning and... Helping her avoid risk-- God knows, that's what you should've been doing-- But... She was worried. You have a healthy body, Nina. If you fall down, you won't turn to stone. And your mom so wanted you to just let yourself fall. Messing up... It's what makes a person. It's how we learn... Where we find joy-- In the things you don't plan for, the things you never see coming. It happened. It was a mistake, and it happened. People make mistakes. We need to figure out where we go from here. We need to figure out how to tell Callie. I'm not gonna tell Callie. Do you know how much this would hurt her? I'm not gonna clear my conscience at her expense. She has done nothing but... support me, encourage me and believe in me, and this is how I pay her back? I have to live with what I did. This is our secret, okay? The thing about plans is, they don't take into account the unexpected.</i> So when we're thrown a curveball, whether it's in the O.R. or in life.... How are you feeling? We have to improvise. I'm a guy without a foot. What do I do now? You move forward, you... You follow the plan and... you try and keep your other foot. My other foot. Right. Of course, some of us are better at it than others. I'm impressed, Karev. You spent the whole day watching a fetal monitor and never complained. Well, I, uh, I do what I'm told. Since when? Depends on who's doing the telling. Good night, Dr. Karev. What was that? How's... Ava? I don't think I'm gonna know the answer to that for a little while. What do you say we talk about you and the redhead instead? Well, the redhead's my boss, so... - So? - So, it's complicated. - And? - And... Some of us just have to move on to plan B...</i> And make the best of it. It has to be small-- Just you and me... And Meredith.. And-- And Shepherd, too, if you want. But that's it. And a justice of the peace. I know you're... spiritual and stuff, but... I-I don't want any rabbis or ministers, nothing religious. We'll just... Make an appointment at city hall, and... that'll be that. And no veil. Okay? I don't want to get married with... mosquito net all over my face. I let Mark use the memory of my mother to win points with the chief. You were right. I'm sorry. - You know what's weird? - What's weird? It's exactly what she would have wanted. Dead mommy's proud? Dead mommy's proud. How was your interview? Not great. It wasn't great. I was distracted. By what? Nothing. I don't know. On a scale of one to ten, how bad is it? Eight. How about, now? Seven. And sometimes... How about, now? Six. - <i>What we want...</i> - Five. - <i>is exactly what we need.</i> - Four, three. But sometimes... I can smell your clothes through the closet door. Did you tie them up in a plastic laundry bag? Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm so sorry. Well, I guess I can... live with it. Sometimes what we need...
