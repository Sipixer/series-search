You left thatcher, ellis. If you could just hold... i'm in the middle of my workday, thatch. Thatch? I look like meredith's dad? Why didn't you stay and fight for us? Why didn't you try harder? I just saw my father for the first time in 20 years. I slept with george. Can we please just go back to everything the way it was? I don't know how to go back. At some point, you are going to have to talk to me. Want to see something really cool? nice!  A good basketball game can have us all on the edge of our seats. Games are all about the glory, the pain and the play-by-play. And then there are the more solitary games... dude... is she knitting? The games we each play all by ourselves. you know, as a... as a friend, i gotta tell you, you look a little weird. I am making a sweater. You're knitting... in a bar. You can't knit in a bar. You're scaring the customers. Come on. Have a drink. I can't have a drink. I'm celibate. You mean sober? She means sober. No, celibate. I'm practicing celibacy, and drinking does not go well with celibacy because it makes everything and everyone seem kind of porn-y, and then my head gets all cloudy, and then the next thing you know, i'm naked. And my point is, i'm celibate, and knitting is good for surgical dexterity, so i'm making a sweater. You celibate? I just don't buy it. No more men. No more men, really? You? And i'm asking because we are friends. Every guy i meet turns out to be married... ooh, ouch. Sorry. Or mark... okay, i'm gonna go over there now. Sorry. Or remember the horrible thing i did? Remember george? you're making a sweater. I am making a sweater. The social games, the mind games... we use them to pass the time, to make life more interesting, to distract us from what's really going on. He's not george anymore. He's broken george. First he chopsff his hair, then he starts hanging out with this callie. That is not a name... callie. Who is she anyway? I'm his best friend. Not that he talks to me anymore. Triple word score. 69 points. Woman, i'm beating the pants off you. Pay attention. What the hell are you doin'? I'm knitting a sweater. Actually, meredith... that's my friend, the friend that broke george... she is knitting a sweater. She's not <i>really</i> knitting a sweater because she cannot knit. But i want her to think she is knitting a sweater because she and i took a celibacy vow so she's replacing sex with knitting, and so i am knitting pieces of meredith's sweater so that i can switch them out with hers so that she can really believe she is knitting. 'Cause if anybody needs to be celibate, it's meredith 'cause she broke george, you know? You took a vow of celibacy? Yes. How am i supposed to get in your pants if you took a vow of celibacy? That is a very inappropriate thing to say to your doctor. Oh, you know what's inappropriate? Promising sexual favors to a patient in order to get him to live and then backing out. Dennyduquette, i so never, ever promised... in my head, you did. In my head, you delivered. Well... but don't worry. You weren't very good. okay. You know what? I was being nice. I was letting you win because you're "mr. Sick needs a new organ guy," but just for that comment, i'm gonna kick your ass. Yeah, i'm gonna... you put down "mount," denny? There are those of us who love to play games... okay, uh... any game. And then there a those of us who love to play... nice! A little too much. Disastrous fema director. poo is... brown. Poo is brown. Michael brown! Yes! Time! Time! yeah, thank you. Impressive, o'malley. thanks. "Poo is?" Apparently we think alike. Wow. I can't believe you're proud of that. Hey, are you supposed to open the papers ahead of time? Hey! It's called strategy. Cristina, it's a game. I know that. Well, you just seem a little intense. We're just trying to have some fun. I'm having fun. Let's do this. Okay. Are you ready? Mm-hmm. Go! Blonde ambition tour. Blonde ambition tour. "Vogue." Oh, are you kidding... okay, she's blonde. She's a blonde, she's ambitious. She's ambitious and... and with the tour and the vogueing and... honey, look at me. Okay, i am... shut up! Cones, cones. Uh, blonde ambition. Boob cones and... and vogueing. Honey, vogueing. Sean penn! Sean penn! Time! Zero points for madonna. Oh! Madonna. Right. Who doesn't know madonna? sore loser. I am not a sore loser. You know, and so what if i am? See, the whole point of games is that there is a winner, a first place. You want a second best surgeon operating on you? No. You want the very best. And second best is mediocre. And to settle for mediocrity is... is... it's frankly, you know, a sign of self-loathing and substandard work ethics. i've gotta get george out of my apartment. You know, you could sleep with him, and then right in the middle, start crying. It's painful and humiliating and unbelievably cruel, but apparently, it works. Would you just keep knitting? Kick him out so that he can come back home to us. No, l-i can't kick him out. He's burke's puppy. It's gotta be burke's idea. I just gotta figure out a way to make him do it. Got a lot of metastatic disease here. How do we proceed? Definitely excise the endobronchial mets for symptomatic palliation. You've been doing your homework, karev. A lot of late nights. Look at this. The mets have adhered to her chest wall. Dude, she's toast. Don't you think that's a little insensitive,dr. Karev? She can't hear me. You don't know that. Bedside manner is part of the job, karev. Late nights won't get you anywhere if you can't figure that out. Thank you. Good morning. Hey, you goin' into surgery ocomin' out? Goin' in. I had to push it back. C's sick. Doc's sick? What are his symptoms? Polydipsia, lethargy and vomiting. Any sign of fever or dehydration? Uh, it's unclear. I was considering running a course of i.v. Antibiotics and a saline drip. Seriously? No, addison, he's a dog. I dropped him off at the vet. They're gonna run some tests and observe him overnight. Meredith will check on him tonight. I gotta run. I got a transfer in from mercy west. Will you wait for me to go home? Yeah. Today we'll be covering... yes. Cristina yang, first year surgical intern. I'm just wondering if wre going to be covering both intra and extracorporeal knots today in the seminar. We'll be training in all aspects of laparoscopic general surgery. Starting with basic instrumentation and camera operation... dr. Yang. Chief. We'll move through several complex procedures, including tissue approximation. The suggested task time for bead transfer is... you're taking the class? It's a good refresher course. Should be fun. And 240 seconds for dominant to nondominate transfer. Good. Yeah. Now who would like to volunteer for our first... dr. Yang. Molly thompson, 22 years old, 32 weeks pregnant. Transferred here from mercy west when an ultrasound diagnosed the baby with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Hello, molly. I'm dr. Addison shepherd. You're supposed to be the best. And not to put any pressure on you or anything, but this is my baby carrying my grandchild, so i really hope that you are. The best, i mean. Mom, you're kind of threatening the doctor. Don't threaten the doctor. It doesn't help. Sorry. My husband tells me i have to try not to be such a mother lion because molly's a grown woman and has her own life and everything, but... roar. it's okay. I can take it. I am the best. You can fix this, though, right? We'll insert a scope into your uterus and then inflate a little balloon in the baby's airway, which should help stimulate the lungs to grow. It's not gonna be easy on either of you, but i do have a strong record with this surgery. Make sure you get her to the m.r.i. And get me the results as soon as you can. I will. Sir, can i help you find something? Uh... is... is there a dr. Meredith grey working today? Yes. Sh-she's here in the hospital right now? I can have someone page her for you if you want me to. No. No. That's... thank you. Wait. Excuse me. Sir? Are... are you... what's your name? Thatcher. You're... grey, yeah. You're meredith's father. Yeah. Are you sure you don't want me to page her for you? No. I'm sorry. It's complicated. Thatcher, honey. We're right here. Oh. Oh, there you are, susan. Did you tell him? I roared a little. I couldn't help it. Oh. Oh, well, i knew you would. i'm sorry. I'm dr. O'malley. I'm, uh, o'mall... l... well, excuse us. Uh, we're gonna check on our daughter. ah, dr. Bailey! Do you have an extra intern? I'm available. No, no, no, no. I said "intern." Shepherd, look at the board. Okay. What am i lookin' at? My name isn't up there. It wasn't up there yesterday and it won't be tomorrow. What'd you do, piss off the chief? Yeah, i pissed off the chief. I went and had a baby. I gave birth. I created a human life. I'm a surgeon. We don't do that. He's mommy-trackin' me. He's just goin' easy on you. No. I change diapers, l-i clean spit up, i sing the a-b-cs... i'm covered in mommy. But that does not mean i will be mommy-tracked. You're freaking out. I just need a surgery. I need a surgery now. So for today, i'm your intern. i have not begun to freak out. All right, come on. Cristina told me that george had a date with ortho chick. Games night. She didn't even take him home afterwards. She hinted that she wanted to and then said she couldn't. That's weird, right? George made it perfectly clear that i am not in his life anymore. You think ortho chick is hiding something? She could be hiding something. Stevens... hold this. George mentioned you're not big on ortho. Grey, take the osteotome and the mallet. Follow me. ms. Carver, unfortunately we found that the cancer has metastasized to your chest wall. We took out a small tumor obstructing your airway, which will help with your breathing, but... it's not a cure. So this is the end of the line? That's what you're saying? This is it, i die now? Beatrice... i want you to go back in. I want you to cut out everything that you can... as much as you can. I want as much time as you can give me, you understand? Well, unfortunately, any additional surgery is... excuse me. Mom, i'm not eating any of that crap in the cafeteria. I mean, we're gonna have to order in thai food or something because i'm starving and the food here blows. I'll have the nurse bring a menu by and we can have a picnic in bed. God, mom. How many doctors do you have? They were just leaving. (man) after trailing by 10 at the half, the offense stepped up, leading a 13-0 run to begin a seesaw battle up to the end. In five to ten years, cutting as we know it will be virtually obsolete. Very nice, dr. Yang. Thank you, sir. A little less tension there, chief. Watch your grip. There you go. I wasn't copying you. Of course not, sir. Done! I'm done. I totally finished first. I'm done. So, dr. Torres... hold it steady, grey. Did you always know you wanted to specialize in orthopedics? Did you always know you wanted to model? Oh. Okay. Grey, i mean it. Watch your grip. And your husband, is he a doctor, too? what are you trying to ask me, dr. Stevens, my history, my marital status, my deep, dark little secrets? I'm george's best friend. Oh, i see. Well, it's just funny. 'Cause from what i understand, as his best friend, you haven't been the best matchmaker in the past. Hi. Hey. Your hair is growing out, which is nice. I still think you should cut it. I could cut it for you... if we still lived together. Or we could just hang out and talk about... stuff, like your new friend... callie. She's, uh... she's very, um... you know, if you like her, i will like her... eventually. I can't escape her. What? All i want to do is forget her, all i want to do is just escape her, and, you know, i can't. You want to escape callie? Oh, thank god. 'Cause she is, like, a total freak, and i was starting to get really worried about you. Not callie. Sorry. . Who? Or, oh... meredith again. I'm gonna tell you something, and the minute i tell you what i'm about to tell you, this officially becomes your problem, not mine. Okay. Meredith has a sister. How are we doing? I turned the skull flap. Patient's sedated. very nice. Nicely done. He... he's a kid. Yes. I just didn't think it would be a kid. A tumor that size... well, what happens now? Now we wake him up. We're doing awake brain surgery on him? Yes. Thank you. Andrew. A little more. Andrew, can you hear me? Hey. Want to count for me? One... good, keep going. (derek) since the tumor is located near the language center of the brain, it's important that we don't damage it. Andrew, i need you to keep talking. Can you do that? can you talk to me? L-i'll try. Okay, great. Now what grade are you in? Um... seventh. You into sports? Not really. How about baseball? Um... baseball's a sport. Right. Okay. What about, uh, girls? Do you have any girlfriends? No. Um... you probably don't have time for girlfriends right, andrew? Probably too busy, right? Y-yes, ma'am. Uh, what are you busy doing? Um... getting ready for the national spelling bee. I won the greater regionals last month. Oh, well, in that case, you need to spell some words for us. Uh, can you do that? Sure. Uh, good. Uh... you usually provide the word, dr. Bailey. I don't hear you coming up with one. Uh, let's see. All right, uh, acetaminophen. Acetaminophen. Origin of the word? Heck if i know. Hey, do you have molly's m.r.i. Results? No. I-i haven't... not yet. What the hell have you been doing then? I was just gonna... when i assign you to a case of mine, i expect you to give it your full and undivided attention. Give me one good reason why l-i shouldn't take you off this case. Molly thompson's maiden name is grey. Her father is thatcher grey. Thatcher grey is also meredith's father, which means that molly and meredith are sisters, but i don't think meredith even knows molly exists. And i don't care. I don't. Except i'm on this case and... apparently, god hates me. Okay. Okay, thanks. I want all this out now. I'm getting out of the hospital. Oh, we can't, beatrice. You just had major surgery. Tomorrow is my daughter's birthday. Apparently it's the last one i get to celebrate, and i'm not spending it in here. Okay, i'm so sorry, but if we remove this tube, your lung will collapse. I'm sure you don't want to spend your daughter's birthday this way, okay? M a quick healer. I'm breathing better since the surgery. That is because we removed some of the tumor to open up your airway. That doesn't mean that you are well, all right? If you try to leave, you are at risk of infection or hemorrhaging. Your kid doesn't even know you have cancer. You really want to risk dropping dead on the street outside the hospital? Dr. Karev... so you thought scaring her back into bed was the way to go? It worked, didn't it? She's lying to her kid. She's frightened. She's in shock it is not your job or your place to take a tone like that with a patient, not ever. Are we understood? Yes, sir. so what are the sister and the father like? Like? They're like people meredith is related to and never met. They're nice. Can you imagine... a sister, a whole family you know nothing about? You think she's gonna freak out? It's not my responsibility to care. Oh, heads up, heads up. Hey, chief. How you doin'? Seems i'm a little rusty on my bead transfer and rope pass. Dr. Yang here's been kicking my ass all day. Oh, no. Oh, i can't imagine... no, really, she has. Of course, speed and precision aren't the most important surgical skills, dr. Yang. Basics are the key. You need a solid foundation before anything else. okay, um... well, i'll see you back at the lab. Sir. Enjoy your lunch. You, too. Bye. Have a nice day, sir. Okay, i really am kicking the chief's ass. George. Not my responsibility. Well, who's gonna... see you guys. It's okay. I can accept rejection. I've got my knitting. Mer... the weird thing is... i thought i just saw my father. Oh! That's good. That's so good. Hmm. Did you meet your sister, too? appoggiatura won last year. Year before that... akshay buddiga... he fainted, then got up anspelled the word alopecoid. Kid's a major legend. all right. Now it's my turn. Fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia? Yeah, what's wrong with fibromyalgia? Andrew <i>won</i> the regionals. He's going to d.c. He's probably insulted by fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia... suction. F-i-b-r-o-m-y-a-l-g-i-a. Fibromyalgia. She's right. That was kind of easy. Okay. You want me to bring on the heat? I'm gonna bring on the heat. Omphalocele. Omphalocele. More suction in there. omphalocele. C-a... okay. Andrew... f... what's happening? F... mark that. We've hit the language center. We just have to pull back. andrew. F... s... andrew. Andrew, andrew, uh, spell it again for me. E... give me the stealth probe, please. Dr. Shepherd's working on it. I don't want you to be scared. I-i want you to wait. Just wait. I want you to hold on. Mark that as well, please. Okay, try now. Okay. All right. Andrew, spell omphalocele one more time for me. Omphalocele. Mark that, please. O-m-p... (derek) good. Okay. H-a-l-o-c-e-l-e. Omphalocele. That's it! That's perfect. Dr. Bailey, are you crying? Oh, i got something in my eye. You're doing great, andrew. We're almost done. Stop lookin' at me like that. It's my hormones. Mm-hmm. I'm still a surgeon. I'm just a surgeon with an excess of estrogen. Deal with it. Andrew, can you spell estrogen? E-s-t-r-o-g-e-n. Here's a word for you. Delusional. delusional... (man) today's final assignment will show how well you can take the skills you have learned and apply them to a single operation. You may begin. so i'm gonna do the surgery with a small scope, and it'lbe minimally invasive. And then you should be able to do the rest of your recovery from home. Thank you. Yeah, okay. uh, molly, this is doctor... uh, this is meredith. She's gonna be continuing your prep work and taking your vitals. Okay? Okay. Hi. Hey. Uh, do you mind if i, um... no, it's fine. I'm getting used to being poked and prodded. That's a... pretty ring. Oh, thanks. It was my grandma's and then my mom's. You think i'm too young to be married. No, l... that's okay. Everybody thinks i'm too young. If i saw me, i'd think i was too young. Um... how... how old are you? 22. Eric's 23, and he's in the army, and he was getting shipped out. And... i just love him so much, you know? Anyway, i proposed. Oh. And your, uh, parents, they approve? Oh, my parents are amazing. I mean, you know how dads can be. Mine's pretty overprotective, but... you know, at my wedding, when he gave me away, my dad cried, which was... i had never seen my dad cry before. But... i think it was also kind of weird for him 'cause i'm his little girl. You know, i'm the youngest, and my sister is, like, nowhere near ready for marriage. But it was good crying. Like he was proud of me, you know? I'm sorry. I'm just... i'm nervous, so i'm talking. no, that's okay. So you have a sister? Yeah, lexie. She's in medical school. Harvard. She's the smart one. You should see how my dad is about her. He's, like, crazy proud. Well, i'm gonna go. Meredith. Mm-hmm. Do you think my baby is gonna be okay? Oh. Well, i hope so. Me, too. Okay. i need some bones to break. What? Some bones to break, something to smash. Can you help me with that, please? Um, you can clean up this cast crap if you want. is she freaking out? No. Unh-unh. She's fine. she's great. so george... he's really... really your type, huh? You don't see him. Either of you, you don't see him. He's just... he's just george to you. He's... he's just o'malley. He's your roommate. You don't have to get all... he makes my world stop. George o'malley is sweet and kind and smart and strong. And he makes my world stop so you shut up about him. don't forget to clean it up when you're done smashing. Holy crap. George is her mcdreamy. i'm done! I'm done! I'm done! (man) flawless, chief webber. Absolutely flawless. They call me dr. Webber. that's why i'm the chief. that's why i'm the chief. * that's why i'm the chief * * the chief * so when is my mom getting out of here? I'm sorry, honey, but it's gonna be a few days. Can you call aunt sue, see if she can pick you up? So i get to spend my birthday hanging out with aunt sue. Perfect. I promise you, next year, next year, we'll do something really special for your birthday. You name it, it's done. I promise. Whatever. So this whole lying thing, this is working out for you? Excuse me? Look, you're going to die, and soon. You get that, right? There's no rosy picture to paint here. You're not a mother. You don't know what it's like to hold your newborn baby in your arms and smell the top of her head and know that your only job in the world is to protect her. You think you're protecting her? I am protecting her. Well, i guess you can call it what you want. But you should just know that you're leaving behind a kid that'll probably hate you the rest of her life. Dr. Karev... no, i'm talking this time. Excuse me? I tell the truth. It's what i do. It doesn't make me a bad doctor. Everyone walks around this place lying. Look, we tell a patient that's dying that there's hope when there is no hope. Maybe i'm a pig, maybe i'm an ass, maybe i'm a vermin like everybody says. But i tell them the truth. It's the one thing that i've got goin' for me. And you don't get to take that away from me and call it a lesson, sir. l-i saw a picture once from a long time ago. You look just like her... your mother. You look a lot like my girls, especially molly. You were talking to her? I didn't say anything about anything. Oh, she knows about you. Or she knows that her father was married before and had another daughter. Has another daughter. No, had is right. Your father thinks about you. He thinks about you a lot. He just... your mother... your mother... she broke him. Ahem. Uh, excuse me. L-i have to work. i spent years studying this board, holding a crying baby, trying to get an idea when my wife would get out of surgery. "Appy" takes about an hour. Anything with the word "cardio," and i knew not to plan on seeing her at all that day. thatcher, are you aware of what's going on with ellis? U have no right... no right... to talk to me about ellis. I'm sorry. But i was trying to talk to you about meredith. thatcher, ellis has early-onset alzheimer's. It's advanced. And it's hard on meredith, as you can imagine. And i thought you'd want to know. hey, andrew. It's dr. Bailey. Remember me? I was in surgery with you. I'm... i'm sorry. No, no, don't worry. Don't worry. A lot of times, kids who are awake during surgery don't remember afterwards. Anyway, your operation went <i>really</i> well. We got all that tumor outta there, and you're gonna be just fine. I... thanks. Okay. You know i have a son, too. And i'm going home right now to tell him that today, i met the best speller in seattle. oh, hey. Dr. O'malley. Hi. I was looking for you. You were... before, when i was asking about meredith... you know her. You're her friend. I used to be her roommate. So you know her really well. Pretty well. she... she came to see me a couple of weeks ago, and... a couple of weeks ago? Yeah. L... and i didn't know what to say to her. She looks so... so much like her mother. Ellis was cold. I mean, i was a coward. I was. L-i left. But her mother would never let me know her, and... now i don't know how to know her. well, meredith is anything but cold. She smiles... not that often... but when she does... you know, because she's... really going through a lot... but... it's... it's like you feel warm. She's kind. I mean, she can be a little selfish. Oh, she can be... she's flawed, but she's kind. She cares out people. And, uh... she cares a-about her patients. I think she's gonna be a brilliant surgeon. You know, around here, she's known as the one to beat. So, l-i don't know, i guess she has that in common with her mom, but... i think the rest of her... i think, uh, i think the rest of that, she gets from you. hmm. Do... do you know... where she is? i think she left already. I could tell her you're... you were here if you want me to. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. thank you, george. hey Hey. Still knitting? Oh, yeah. I'm getting so good at it. I did a craniotomy on a kid today while he was awake. I met a sister i never knew i had. And i saw my father, which was, uh... i don't know what it was. You okay? I have my knitting. Study hard. Keep your grades up. Starting next year, you're gonna want to take two a.p. Classes a semester if you want to get into a decent college. Mom, this is really morbid. And your aunt sue is kinda lazy when it comes to personal hygiene. so you may have to be the one who remind her when she next time to get your eyebrows waxed or get your hair cut, but eventually, she'll get the routine down. Can we not have this conversation? Oh, this might sound random, but wear underwear with pantyhose. I know it might feel a little bulky, but honestly, it's a little slutty not to, and also, that's how you get yeast infections. Mom... (laughs) This is totally gross. And marry a kind man, one who's nice to his mother. Now if he lives with his mother, you run the opposite way. Mom, i'm not getting married anytime soon. You will someday. And when that day comes, just have one glass of champagne and then you drink water for the rest of the night because there's nothing tackier than a drunken bride. Mom, i don't wanna... why are you telling me all this? Honey, i've been sick for a long time, and the doctors don't think that i'm gonna get better. No. Amelia, listen to me. Look at me. Amelia. This is important. This one is... is really the important one. Someday, you're gonna have a baby. And you're gonna feel overwhelmed by this little life that you're responsible for. And you're gonna think... worry that everything you do is wrong, and that's normal. You're gonna obsess about what to feed it and where to send it to school and whether it should take violin or piano. But i'm gonna let you in on a little secret. It doesn't matter. Whether your kid is a concert pianist or a math genius, it just doesn't matter. Because at the end of the day, all that matters is if your kid is happy. So you're gonna feel sad for a little while. And that's okay. That's... that's fine. But don't feel sad forever, okay? You can promise me that? You promise me that you won't feel sad for too long. I promise. Okay. Thank you. 'Cause you're making me feel much better. Life is not a spectator sport. Win, lose or draw... the game is progress... whether we want it to be or not. You made me a sweater... today? In one day, you made me a sweater? Yeah, well, you know, i just, i had some time, so... wow. That vow of celibacy must really be something. You know what? Just accept your gift and say thank you. Does this mean i don't get any sexual favors? Sweater instead of sex? Smell it. Go on. Smell it. It smells like izzie. Yeah, i wore it for three hours. So that is the closest you're gonna be gettin' to this body, mister. You wanna play some scrabble or are you too tired? Scrabble, please. Okay. Just show me one boob. Chief, sir. Nice work today, yang. Hopefully, your fellow interns will be as adept on the scope as you. Thank you, sir, but, um, you weren't even looking. You actually had your eyes closed, so how... um, i was watching you, and you didn't even need the... well, you didn't even need the screen to help you guide the needle holder. Old school, yang. Muscle memory. You want to win? Always go back to the basics. It's my move? Cristina, what the hell are you doing? being comfortable in my apartment. I didn't see anything. I did not see anything. Get out. Yeah. Basics. So go ahead... argue with the refs, change the rules, cheat a little... Take a break and tend to your wounds. But play. hello? Play. hi. Hi. you live here? Yeah. I'm not... crazy or anything, i just spend so much time here in the hospital... it's just... it's easier. So... i'm not... i'm not crazy or anything. do you know how to cut hair? Play hard... play fast... play loose and free. play as if there's no tomorrow. come on, bubbles. Dandridge veterinary clinic. We certainly do. Yes. Thank you. You're getting the hang of it? Not really. You give up men? No. Yes. You know, i don't actually need to see the vet. I really just wanted to sit with doc. I just want to spend time with my dog. hi. I'm finn dandridge. I'm doc's vet. And you are dr. Grey, doc's other owner. We finally meet. Hello.
