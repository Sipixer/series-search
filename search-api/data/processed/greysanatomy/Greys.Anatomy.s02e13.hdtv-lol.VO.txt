Yeah,it's my mother. She has alzheimer'S. Have you even bothered to tell burke about the baby? I had a right to know. I failed the medical boards. That's pretty embarrassing. I'm pregnant, you blind moron. Can we please just talk? You're too busy screwing nurses to talk. I never wanted to hurt you. Sometimes I think we'd be better off with dogs. I said down! Izzie! Izzie!ËüÕý¸ú×ÅÎÒ... fresh starts-- thanks to the calendar, they happen every year. Just set your watch to january. You know,I'm thinking about coloring my hair. -Maybe red. -Red's good. -I'm thinking about cutting mine. -Yeah?You'd look good shorter. -You think? -Yeah. oh,he's such a good dog. Who's a good boy? He's a good boy. What a good dog.Who's mommy's little boy? Oh,what a good boy. You're such a good boy. What are you guys doing in there? We're gonna be late. We need to talk about the dog. That's not a dog. It's a hyena escaped from the zoo dressed in dog clothing. Whatever. I don't chew up his clothes. I don't urinate on his bed. I don't try to mount him from behind. People,he's our dog. We love our dog.He loves us. -ËüÕæµÄÏëÒ§Äã? -ÕæµÄ he tries to. our reward for surviving the holiday season is a new year bringing on the great tradition of new year's resolutions. I got a trout. -Oh! -Rainbow trout. Why--why did you bring a trout into the house? The trailer. Why did you bring a rainbow trout into the trailer? -Breakfast. -Breakfast? -Yeah,you hungry? -For trout? I hate this,derek. I hate this! Hate,hate. I hate this trailer! So no trout for you then. Put your past behind you and start over. I'm standing there with pritchard and lewis, and they keep on asking me who I was with in the on call room last night. They heard us. Were we that loud? -Y-you're loud. -Stop. I am loud,aren't I? Pritch. He was always sticking his nose in someone else's business. You know,I actually saw him again, -at his wife's funeral. -What?Pritchard isn't married. Uh,oh,right,right. I'm thinking of someone else. I'm just confused. You need sleep. Residency has worn you down. -Ellis,um... -yes. Nothing.I just... -hate being an intern. -hate being an intern. It's hard to resist the chance at a new beginning, a chance to put the problems of last year to bed. So... in the name of the new year-- oh,huh,I don't do resolutions. In the name of the new year, I thought you could give me an answer to my question. Your question? About you... moving in. I don't have an answer. -Cristina-- -I'm not being cristina,I just... I don't have an answer. Then answer me this, what were you planning to do? -About what? -The baby. Dr. Burke, we're ready for you. listen up,people, new year,new rules. Or should I say,new year, we will be enforcing the rules mandated by the residency review committee There were too many mistakes made last year. Fatigue played too big a role. Exceeding 80 hours of work per week will not be tolerated... does that mean we actually get to have a life? I think so. ...Sullivan,you were on call for 28 hours.Leave when you hit 30. Grey,you were here until 2 A.M. Last night,see you at noon. -I get to go?Free time? -Run before he changes his mind. »¹ÓÐ»¤Ê¿ÃÇare gonna have to work extra hours to compensate,so treat them well. Cranky nurses don't do us any good. Oh,well,maybe you can cheer them up. you know what? My new year's resolution was to let it go,and I am. I have.I've let it go. I apologize. -You do? -I do. How'd your test go? I feel pretty good about it, but I won't know for a few days. We're all pulling for you. -We are? -We are. You can see the mesothelioma better now that I've partially dissected it. Uh,I can't,uh,I can't really see it from here. -Can I--can I go in closer? -You're fine there. Preston,good news. We have a heart for denny duquette. That's great news. Has he been called? Got here ten minutes ago. Well,good.I was worried we couldn't find a match in time. We have a plane ready to take you to twin falls, idaho,for the organ recovery-- 90 minutes each way. How much more do you have here? Well,the heart comes out first. No,I'd be cutting it too close. They have a local heart team there,so-- no,bailey. Send bailey. She'll be our eyes. Dr. Yang,you need to leave this O.R. Excuse me? You've exceeded your 80-hour limit for the week. You have to leave the hospital. Okay,um,um,as soon as the mesothelioma's dissected out. Dr. Yang,now. You heard him. denny duquette. Hey,dr. Bailey. I hope seeing you here means they finally found you a heart. No offense,doctor,but I'm not a big fan of hospitals. It'd take something pretty special to get me in here. And what do we know about mr. Duquette? Capricorn,single, loves to travel and cook. Denny,be quiet. Let her show off. Denny duquette,36,admitted today for a heart transplant necessitated by a viral cardiomyopathy. and what does that mean? That his heart is unable to fill and pump blood normally. Good. Denny, this is dr. Stevens. She'll be tending to you prior to surgery. So I guess I'll be seeing you around,dr. Stevens. I gotta hand it to the guy,trying to get some action when he's practically a corpse. Alex,he was just trying to be nice. No one enforced an 80-hour work week when I was an intern. 110,120 hours suited me just fine. I learned more, cause I worked more. Well,at least this way,you get to rest before you have the baby. I mean,being that pregnant, keeping up this pace... what are you saying, I look tired,o'malley? No,not--not tired,no. You look fresh,spry. You glow. What... stop now. O'malley,go do an intake on addison shepherd's patient. addison. You do glow. Like the moon. And you can spend the day in the pit,karev. I'm just trying to make a point. I understand your point,honey. But you have to believe what buckman said.Look,I want-- -dr. O'malley. -Hi. Um,mr. And mrs. Singleton, rebecca,this is dr. Montgomery-shepherd. You don't think it's cancer,do you? Bex is too young for cancer,right? Mrs. Singleton,I'm just getting up to speed.I'm sorry. Dr. O'malley? -Rebecca's been admitted for-- -could you stop calling me that? She prefers bex, not rebecca. Bex has been admitted for an ultrasound guided biopsy on an enlargement of a pelvic lymph node. Okay. Bex,you mind if I check it out? Okay,I'll just,um... it's a minor procedure,bex. But we'll give you a local anesthetic to manage the pain. What are you drawing? Just a dumb comic. You're really talented. It's big,I know. It just appeared one day. I'll perform a biopsy this morning, and dr. O'malley will have to take some blood so he can run some tests And then we can start to get you some answers,okay? Mrs. Singleton, there's no need to panic. I'll keep you posted every step of the way. Thank you. Sorry about this,but I'm gonna need that arm to get some blood. I'll be quick. Mr. Paskowitz, we've located the source of your abdominal pain. There. It's called a bezoar. Bezoar,huh? It's a clump of foreign matter that couldn't be expelled with a prokinetic agent I love it.In a hospital, a laxative is a prokinetic agent. So what,you just go up his butt and grab it? Baby,please. Actually,we won't be able to reach it that way We'll have to get it from here So,mauer,tell me what you've been eating. Garbage. Absolute garbage. Could you be more specific? Tell him what you ate,mauer. He's a writer, suffering for his art. Okay. He ate his novel. -Uh,I'm sorry. What? -I ate my novel,okay? The whole damn thing. Every last piece of that unmitigated crap. -------------------------- ±¾ÂÛÌ³×ÖÄ»½ö·­Òë½»Á÷Ñ§Ï°Ö®ÓÃ ½ûÖ¹ÈÎºÎÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾·ñÔòºó¹û×Ô¸º -------------------------- -=COSL-YTETÐ¡×é=- ÒÁµéÔ°ÂÛÌ³ Ê±¼äÖá:¿ìÀÖµÄÊ÷ÀÁ nobody knows where they might end up nobody knows GA SEASON2 E14 -The labs for bex singleton. -Anything? Yeah,her hormone levels-- estrogen,progesterone--are sky high. Huh,that's-- you did a history,right? Any mention of birth control pills? No,but her parents were right there. Talk to her again. She hasn't hit puberty yet. Isn't it weird she'd be having sex? These days,dr. O'malley, it's not that unusual. Talk to the patient. -Derek. -Hi,morning,richard. You busy? No. My surgery just got canceled. Why? -I need a favor. -Sure. Hey,bex. Your mom and dad... food. Great. Beause I wanted to talk to you. Your lab,uh,work show-- have you been taking birth control pills? -If you tell my mom and dad,they- -no,I won'T. I just,uh, need to know why. Do you have a boyfriend or... like anybody would want to have sex with me. Well,then why? I'm as flat as a board. I took,like, five of those pills a day, and nothing's different. Boobs,dude. You...were trying to make your breasts grow? I wanted to be normal for once in my life. -Is this what caused the tumor? -No,no. The pill wouldn't have any effect on your lymph nodes, but the amount that you were taking is really dangerous, and it caused a pretty major hormonal imbalance. Have you been feeling different than usual? I feel like I always feel. -hi. -Hi. You're leaving? 80-hour limit. You? Surgery was postponed. -I have a dog. -You have a dog. My point is, I have a dog. You have a dog. Oh,you know what?I love dogs. I've moved on, so don't give me that look. -What look? -That look. Our look. -I'm over you. -I'm over you,too. -You are? -No. Oh.Well, I am.Over you. I'm over you,too. You just said... oh,shut up. -hi. -Bye. There is a land -and you are their queen. -I am fine. Except when you're shrieking about trout. I was not shrieking about trout. Right,you weren'T. You were shrieking about meredith. No,I was shrieking about the trailer. I hate the trailer. Okay,so the past three weeks have been about the trailer. Yes. Not about the fact that I said I love meredith Loved. -What? -You said you loved her,past tense. Right,yes. Past tense. Well,then I have been shrieking about the trailer. okay,mauer,it's time to return your book to the library. Surgery's in an hour. What's up with this flop sweat? Probably just nerves. But I'm sweating like--like--like nixon, president richard milhous nixon. That guy could sweat. And I,mauer paskowitz, I wrote an epically crap novel, but I sure as shinola can sweat like nixon. Come on. It's not even that bad of a book. I read practically every draft. Forgive me,honey,but you are not exactly lionel trilling. It blows. Lionel trilling? He seeks the approval of dead literary critics. The dead don't read,mauer. You ever think about being something other than a writer? No. I am a writer. Mauer paskowitz. I have no plan "B." We can't get married for three years, till the damn book is done. Three years,I listen to him piss and moan. For what, so he can eat the thing? Ha. Your computer have a "delete" button? I wanted to literally put it behind me and start a new book. Okay. We all get the symbolism. It's painfully obvious. And obviously painful. hey. Uh,hi. um,I heard you're going to twin falls,idaho. I've never been. You reached 80 hours? Technically. You're off work,cristina. Go enjoy your day. I'll enjoy my day if i can help retrieve a heart.I promise. It's a nice coat. See that,dr. O'malley? It looks like the tumor is compressing an ovary. Yeah,that's why I biopsied both ovaries. Is that bad? It's really just a precaution,bex. -Want to apply pressure,dr. O'malley? -Mm-hmm. I'm gonna get this up to path. -You mind doing the dressings? -sure. All right,bex, we'll get you the results just as soon as possible. You're a doctor. Haven't you seen scars before? I was just trying to figure out why someone with so much talent would want to do that. It's just a comic book. It's about me and my best friend jenn when we were kids. Satisfied? Does she write it with you? Jenn has a boyfriend, like everyone else. I get to be a freak all by myself. Oh,a freak? That's not the easiest thing to be in high school,is it? You sound like my shrink. Hey,I wasn't always a doctor. In high school... I was secretary and treasurer of... the dungeons & dragons club. Oh,man. Yeah. I was also a mathlete. And I won the blue ribbon in biology club. Best fetal pig dissection. Ah,let me tell you,that had the girls knocking down my door. You just have to get through high school. Because high school sucks for anyone who's the least bit different. But then there's college, and then out in the real world, you'll find where you fit in. -You think so? -Yeah,I know so. Hi. Denny.I thought you were asleep. Nah. I don't sleep in hospitals. Scared I'll never wake up. Can I ask you something personal? If I say no? I'll hold my breath, which will stop my heart, killing me. And you're right here, you'll be charged with murder. A lifetime in prison being loved by a big old girl named hilde. So my choicesare homicide charges or inappro priate personal questions from a patient? I know,it kinda sucks. You know what? Hold your breath. I'll take my chances with hilde. I can do girl on girl. Oh,see,you're bringing up girl on girl. How can I blackmail you if you bring up girl on girl? What do you want to know? That guy alex, you with him? No,not anymore, and never,ever again. -Good. -Good? Yeah,good. It means I won't have to fight him for you. What makes you think I want you to fight him for me? Hello. -You are in love with me. -Am I? Yeah. It's not your fault. I mean,I'm well-off, but I'm not into money, I'm smart, but I'm not a know-it-all, I'm funny, I'm--I'm really nice I love animals and I'm hot.I'm a catch, you know, if you can wrap your head around the enlarged, failing heart and the dependency to I.V. Meds. you're right. I am so in love with you. It's a shame,really, since I'm with hilde and all. there-- five loads of laundry. I have literally washed the past out of my life. You paged me? Yeah. Have a look at this. It's bex' biopsy. Biopsied ovary? Not exactly. Arrange a meeting with bex' parents,george. and find out who the on call psychiatrist is if they're available to join us. Does she have cancer? No. It's not an ovary, it's a testis. A testis? Are you sure? Yes,I'm sure. Bex is a hermaphrodite? Yes. Yang... why are you staring at my fat,pregnant belly? Sorry. I... let me get this straight.You're telling me that our daughter--my daughter-- you're telling me my daughter might actually be a boy? That-- how is that possible? I-I don't understand. I don't understand how that-- sh-shouldn't this have been  detected somehow? Externally,bex has female genitalia. She looks like a girl. But internally,she has both female and  male sex organs. So what now? What are we supposed to do? I-I don't understand-- okay,the best news is that the lymph node tumor is benign. So physically,bex is going to be just fine, but emotionally, psychologically, I strongly recommend therapy. she's already in therapy. I'm talking about therapy for all of you. This is not gonna be easy for bex to hear, and it's not gonna be an easy adjustment for you to make. Oh,my god. A big adjustment, what kind of adjustment? Many intersexed people begin to identify very strongly with one sex, and it's not necessarily the sex they've been raised. She's a girl. She looks like a girl. She has always been a girl. This at least helps explain why she feels so different. The point is,biologically and  emotionally speaking, she has a choice to make. A choice? My mouth feels all weird. Chewing paper will have that effect,lover. Weird how? Pins and needles. No,needles and pins. Needles and pins-- yeah,yeah-- sprouting from my fingers and toes like--like--like... lord,god,give me a simile. Is he always this way? The man ate a novel. He's not exactly normal. But he got weirder,the more he ate. He's,like,obsessed. Mr. Paskowitz, I'm dr. Webber. I'm gonna be performing your surgery today. I poured my heart and soul into that freakin' book, and now it's stuck up my ass. Put that on my tombstone,audrey. On my tombstone! Hey,dr. Stevens. Hey,denny. You okay? I've been waiting for this a long time,you know? You open up my chest,take out my heart, and replace it with another one. Well,not me, and not another heart, a better heart. what if something goes wrong? Don't be nervous. Dr. Burke is an incredible surgeon. And you're getting a new heart today. Just keep thinking about that. Okay,okay. Denny. Preston burke--my favorite cardiothoracic surgeon. You're only cardiothoracic surgeon,but thanks. I'll be on the phone with dr. Bailey as the organ recovery progresses. We'll make sure that the heart stays viable, isn't damaged as the other organs are perfused. We'll have you in the O.R., And if it is a go, we start the procedure before she even gets back. Hey,izzie. Yeah. I'm gettin' a new heart. You're getting a new heart. I'll see you. Bye. um,excuse me. Um,mary and I were talking, and,uh,we think bex should stay-- she can't handle something like this. You saw the scars. Wait,you're not gonna tell her? But this could help her. You can't not tell her who she is. Dr. O'malley. Uh,we'll go ahead and proceed with the scheduled surgery to remove the tumor, and then you can talk to your daughter in your own time. Actually,we're thinking... we thought, since you're already gonna be in there,uh... we know "fixed" isn't the right word,but-- we were thinking that with the hormonal confusion, it might be easier on her to remove whatever boy parts she has. Keep her more of a girl. Just to be clear,you're asking me to perform sexual reassignment surgery on your daughter? -yes. -Without her knowing? all she's said all her life is that she wants to be normal. She doesn't feel normal. Why can't we just put an end to her agony? Well,first of all,removing her male sexual organs may not do that. In fact, it could do just the opposite. but her hormones-- can be controlled with an oral medication. We just want the best for bex. To do surgery and alter her body permanently is-- well,I just would never do that on someone  who's unaware of the procedure, and you're gonna be hard pressed to find a surgeon who will. Bex will learn the truth... someday. H-how do you want her to find out? Excuse me. Meredith,hi. Hi. I had the morning off, so I thought I would come and see how my mother's doing. Oh,she's fine. She's in the sitting room. -Thanks. -She's in good spirits. Visitors really cheer her up. visitors? what are you doing here? There is a clinical trial to study the progression of early-onset alzheimer'S. Okay,me,you can screw with. My mother? No,not acceptable. Look,there's been some really promising results from similar studies in europe. Your mother is a prime candidate. My mother is very sick and has very few good days. And I don't want her being poked and prodded for some experimental program. I'm just trying to help. Well,see,this,what you're doing, being dreamy, it doesn't help. It hurts me. It messes with my head. I know the feeling. I don't doubt that. But you have a wife to go home to. And I'm guessing she has no idea where you are right now. Yeah. No,she doesn'T. That's what I thought. Dr. Burke. Talk to me,bailey. What are we looking at? The,uh,the donor is on 25 mics of dopamine. 25 mics? That's too much. They've started him on 5 mics of dobutamine 30 minutes prior to arrival. Are they trying to kill my heart? What is his central venous  pressure now? C.V.P.,Doctor? Back around 10 -Around 10. -Map close to 80. And his mean arterial pressure? Close to 80. I can live with a C.V.P. As low as 5,a map about 60. That heart needs to be off dobutamine. The heart needs to be off dobutamine. And tell them to get the dopamine back down to 10 mics and get them to get another 2 units of blood. We a go,doc? Still no final word. I want you to have the healthiest heart I can find. Dr. Stevens,you'll be in there  with us,right? Yeah,I'll be in there with you. all right,people. We're going to be removing a clump of foreign matter lodged hey,aren't you supposed to be having free time? Oh,I did five loads of laundry, cut my split ends,studied, cleaned out the fridge. Free time sucks. When would have been the right time to hear about your boyfriend's wife? Okay,are you mad at me or something? No. No. Sorry. It's just, I have this patient,and I get that there's a right and a wrong time to hear big news, but wouldn't you rather know sooner than later? I mean,so you can move forward one way or the other. I mean,it's a fresh start,right? See the white line of toldt? Now we can mobilize the lateral border  the lateral border of the left colon.Clamp. When leo tolstoy here wakes up, you might get him to revisit the idea of a new vocation. He's pretty against the idea. Yeah,well,hopefully, it was just delirium. If it's all right,I'd like to keep an extra eye on him post-op. He's acting pretty strange. He ate a novel. Clearly,he's pretty strange. Yeah,you know,it's just, I don't want to overlook anything. Seriously,karev, I'm short-handed all over the hospital. Okay,here we go. Anybody here tempted to read this? No takers? Could be the great american novel. We'll never know. He needs a plan "B." He may not be the only one. You don't think you passed? I thought I passed the first time. Well,let's wait and see. Right now,today, you're still here. Did you tell my parents about the pill? No. Am I gonna die? Is that what no one wants to tell me? Of course not. Then why are my parents acting so... will you just tell me what's going on? What's going on is,uh, we're prepping you for surgery to remove the lymph node tumor that's compressing your... ovary. Hey,bex. How you doin'? Mom,dad,this is really freaking me out. Oh,no,everything's gonna be fine,bex. It's okay,sweetie. I'm having surgery to remove a tumor that's compressing my ovary, right,george? Dr. O'malley. George? What,am I just supposed to lie to her? Okay. That's enough. Dr. O'malley,please leave the room. No,wait. Tell me what's wrong with me. What is wrong with me? Bex... we learned that your tumor, it's not compressing an ovary. Then where is it? It's on a testes. Like a testicle? I have testicles? yes,one. Bex,this is a tremendous amount of information for you-- and I've had it my whole life. Oh,my god. Does this mean... does this mean I could be a boy? You engineered that conversation. You forced our hand. Well,you were lying to her. We were protecting her. She's a 14-year-old girl. Maybe. Maybe not. This isn't your life. This isn't your child. 14 years--14 years, we have raised a daughter, and in one afternoon, you expect us to--what? What is bex supposed to do? How is she supposed to go home and tell the other kids--what? You had no right. No,I know. I'm off the case,right? Ohh Mauer Mauer,lay back. You just had surgery. You're losing your shirt,man. Much obliged,brock-- brock-- much obliged,pal. How are you feeling,mauer? Much obliged.What's whacked for $20,alex? Weeds whacked. Weeds. Weeds whacked for $200. W-way--way whacked. Wh-- I saw ellis. And? I think I can get her into the clinical trial. She's a perfect candidate. Excellent. Thank you,derek. You realize this requires meredith's power of attorney. Yeah. It might be better if it's coming from you. With me,there's baggage. You,you're just trying to help out a friend. Right. Right. Well,let me know if meredith wants me to make the call. Karev... what are you doing? Research on the bezoar patient. I told you I needed you on the floor. He has fever,sweats,tingling in his lips, fingers and toes, mood swings and lack of coordination. And did I mention the crazy talk? Your point? Well,my point is,he ate his novel. I know. Mercury's in the paper. He's got mercury poisoning. Cristina,call burke. I'm feeling some fairly extensive damage from coronary artery disease. Um... yang. talk to me,bailey. it's me. I can't talk. I'm waiting on a call from bailey. I'm with bailey. You're in idaho? Yeah. You're breaking the rules. Yes. Preston,what's happening with our heart? Hello,dr. Webber. Tell me what I need to know about  denny's heart,dr. Bailey. thank you. This program derek looked into  was a favor to me. Nice try. Sometimes,meredith,a favor is just a favor. This treatment won't cure your mother, it won't give her a new lease on life, but it may give her more good days. I urge you to consider it. Lying here trapped in this flesh prison, I have reached a grim conclusion. I am a failure. You know how that feels? Dude,if you only knew. Even my manic attempt to put  my failed novel behind me failed. Time for a plan "b," I reckon. Time,indeed. Perhaps I shall play the cello. Well,we make a mistake here and people die. It happens all the time. All the time? Well,it happens a lot. This is part of the hallucination,right? My point is,we all have setbacks,mauer. But I'm a doctor,and you're a writer. We don't have a plan "B." Call security. Have you determined a course of treatment  for the mercury poisoning,dr. Karev? Yeah,the patient has been administered a chelator called british anti-leukocyte, which will absorb the mercury over the next several days. Good work,doctor. Yang... you know what's wrong with having an 80-hour limit? It protects the weak. It levels the playing field, which not only sucks,it's dangerous. 80-hour work week, that's what's on your mind? I thought about it... not keeping it. You did? My husband and I, we tried for years, but still,when that stick turned blue... well,you can't work the way we work, you can't want the kind of careers that we want, and not take... pause. I took pause. -You paused? -I paused. I paused a very long time. So why did... I sat up one night, middle of the night... and i knew I could do this. Now I still don't know how I'm gonna do this,but I knew I could do it. You just have to know, and when you don't know, then no one can fault you for it. You do what you can when you can, why you can. And when you can't, you can'T. You're stalking me. You're a stalker. Well, can you blame me? So it's bad,huh? You have time. Liar. Fine,there's no time. Oh,now that's just spiteful. I didn't get the heart. You didn't get the heart. Hey,george. Hey,I just,uh... I just wanted to check in on you. I heard my parents weren't too  happy with you. Nope. Thanks for telling me, for making them tell me. You know,um,there are people that you can talk to. I can--if you'd like-- I know. George, do i have to be a boy now? No. No. But I can if I want to. Yeah,you can, if you want. I... could you... would you bring me some scissors? Who gets to determine when the  old ends and the new begins? Derek. Hi. Tell me about the program. It's not a day on a calendar, not a birthday, not a new year. Hey,denny. We'll see ya. Goodbye Dr.xxx Hey,he's leaving? Didn't get the heart. I'm sorry. Yeah. He's a good guy. Yeah,he is. It's an event, big or small, something that changes us. Ideally,it gives us hope... a new way of living and looking  at the world. I'm cookin' the trout outside. Thank you. There is a land called passive aggressiva... and I am their queen. That's all I'm saying. So what... with meredith... am I supposed to just wait it out, wait until it passes? That'd be good. I still hate the trailer. As is your right. Letting go of old habits, old memories... I wasn't gonna have it, the baby. And you don't get to be mad about that. We barely knew each other,I was an intern, and there was no way that I could have even-- I'm not mad. You're not? No. I just wanted to know. I want to know things. What's important is that we never stop believing we can have a new beginning. doc,that was my laundry. You don't eat laundry. Bad dog. Bad dog. but it's also important to remember
