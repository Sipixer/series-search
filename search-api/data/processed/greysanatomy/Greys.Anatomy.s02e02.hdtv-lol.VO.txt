what are you doing here You had a life in manhattan. had Bringing addie out was a business decision Nothing personal. It is personal to me Don't sweat it,shepherd. I'll only be you boss a few days I have a girlfriend. olivia You and alex? You gave me syphilis?! Aah! I think it's best to make a clean eak. Oh,you 'rending this. I'm pregnt. Have you ever bothered to tell burke about the baby I've had this thing for my roommate since,like day one, and i just can't tell her. My husband didn't cheat on me. I cheated on him It's like i was drowning, and you saved me. It's not enough. I have an aunt who, whenever she poured anything for you,would say,"say when." It's not us. It's them. Them and their stupid boy... penises. They didn't tell me they had a wife. They gave absolutely no warning that they were going to break up with you. It's not that burke broke up with me. It's how he broke up with me... like it was business, like it was a business trans... like he's the boss of me? He is the boss of you. And what's worse is that i care. I'm gonna throw up again. my aunt say,say when and of course,we never did No. Wait. False alarm. The problem is estrogen. No,the problem is tequila. I used to be all business. And then he goes and gets me pregnant. With his stupid boy penis. now I'm having hormone surges. He ruined me. I'm ruined. He turned me into this fat,stupid pregnant girl... who cares. Estrogen. Penises. Penises,izzie. Estrogen,george. Okay. What did i miss? I came home to full-on vomit drama apparently,she dumped derek. And her? she's been sleeping with burke. Oh,i knew that. We don't say "when" because there's something irresistible about the possibility of more. So you really broke up with shepherd? I feel empty. Two hours of vomiting will do that to you. More tequila. More love. more anything.More is better. No. I feel empty You're lucky. I feel pissed off. stop. What? You're stalking me. Stop it. Did we not communicate last night? yes Did you hear what i was saying? Your wife screwed your best friend. And then from that point on, she no longer existed to me anymore. You had marital amnesia. No. I bared my soul to you last night. It's not enough. How can that not be enough? When you waited two months to tell me, and i had to find out by her showing up, all leggy and fabulous,and telling herself? You pulled the plug. I'm a sink with an open drain. Anything you say runs right out. There is no"enough." She probably could have picked a better metaphor. Give her a break. She's got a hanover. Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Burke. We have an organ donor coming in this afternoon from wilkeson general. We're doing the harvest... commendable. In o.r.1 at 4. I'm in o.r.1 at 4. Your surgery's non-critical. You can't bump me You'll be first up tomorrow. As chief... interim chief. I can. Bump somebody else. You're in the o.r. We need. Why don't they do the harvest at wilkeson? Small facility in the boonies... a doc in the box. We have the location,the airport nearby and the staff. Your surgery is rescheduled. "Mine's bigger than yours." Whip it out. I'll measure. Shut up,alex. Shut up,alex. Male,55,victim of a head-on collision. G.c.s. Is 3,depressed skull fracture, multiple internal injuries,a.c.l.s. Protocol started, but his vein's blue so we've been pushing meds down the tube. P.e.a. On arrival. How long's he been down? We've been doing c.p.r. For about 20 minutes. It took fire 20 minutes to get him out of the car. He's pretty much gone. No,he's not gone until we say he's gone. Keep coding. O'malley,get him into abay and save him. But he's dead. Did you not hear me? He's not dead until we say he's dead. You know what to do,so do it. Grey,you're on this,too. Move. We've got three more victims in the other car coming in. Let's move,people. He's dead. Hey,olivia. Pulseless v tach. Line's in. Okay,charge to 200. 200. Clear. (monitor beeps) Push one of epi. Let's go again. Charge 300. Seriously? I thinthat's what dr. Bailey wants you to do,george. Dr. O'malley. It's what she wants,dr. O'malley. Okay,then let's charge to 300. 300. Clear. Male,46,unrestrained driver of the car that jumped lanes. B.p. 80 over palp,tachycardic,last pulse... 138. Got 2 liters l.r. Running wide open. Significant abdominal tenderness. Any history? Wife says he's got a bad liver. He's on the transplant list. Abdomen's rigid. Okay,hands off. We need to page burke and domner. Prep this guy for the o.r. Who wants it? I do! I do! I do! No,you're too late. Stevens,take it. Yes! Karev,take the boy. Yang,the mom. I wanna be looking at their films in 15 minutes. We got one more for you. What is it? That guy. He was in the accident? No,bowel obstruction. He's not telling us what he ingested, but the films look like he's packing. Can't people figure out a better way to move drugs? Grey? Oh,pericaiocentesis,good. Any response? Okay,uh,all right,you guys,can... should i call it? Well,what would you do next,o'malley? I would call it. To save him. Uh,um... a pericardial window? Excellent. Do it. Grey,you're done here. I got a bowel obstruction for you. Fun. At least your patient's still alive. What next,doctor? * nobody knows where they might end up * * nobody knows * * oh,oh * * suppose you'll never know ** Okay,stop,That's it. That is not it. Come on,will you stop it? That's it. That is not it,richard,hold still. How can i hold still when you're poking me? I have to poke you to discharge you What makes you think he wants to be discharged? Derek,don't you know this hospital will crumble unless richard's here holding up the walls? Adele,you're supposed to be in the virgin islands. Oh,you are in five kinds of trouble,mister man. You had brain surgery and didn't tell me? It was just a small procedure. It was brain surgery. I didn't want to ruin your vacation. You don't know what a vacation is. How would you know how to ruin it? Well,anyway... how did you find... you called my wife? You called mine. Look,having someone home with you is the only way i'm letting you out of here today. Fine. I thought i saw a fabulous looking woman walk by. Addison,yes,see! Hi. I told richard i knew you and derek would get back together. Uh,actually,I'm here on a case. Addison and i are over,adele. It's not like we're divorced. Practically divorced. You've had counseling? We had adultery. That was enough. I'll call you later,okay? Mm-hmm. You should give her a chance,derek. It's good to see you. Keep him in line. My mom's okay,right? Yeah,yeah,i think so. They'd been fighting at breakfast. Dad gets ugly when he gets like that. Ran three stoplights before we even got on the freeway. My husband bob's a really good driver. Some guy in a pickup cuts us off. Safe,you know? I think he saw something in the... in the middle of the road and... my dad just lost it. And swerved to avoid it. He started chasing the guy. The crash... it just... it just came outta nowhere. Blasting through traffic. We'd been having a really nice morning. One minute,everything's fine. And the next... screaming at him. I could see the guy's face before we hit. Next thing i know... we're upside down on the other side of the freeway. Do the surgeons know that bob has a bad liver? They know. How's scotty? Your son's in the next room getting x-rayed. My dad... he... he's in surgery. It's pretty serious. Yeah,well... i guess the son of a bitch got what he deserved. What makes people think they don't need seatbelts? My end is done. Well,the bowel's a mess,but it's repairable. It's a lot of work,but i don't see the point with this liver. What do you see,dr. Stevens? Uh,deep laceration,bleeding. What else? It's hard and pale... cirrhotic. They said he's on the transplant list. Does he have family here,stevens? A wife and son. Okay,i'm just gonna roll you over. Gently. Oh! This looks pretty bad. How did you get this? Well,we hit so hard. I don't think this is from the collision. It looks a couple of weeks old. Where are you? I can see his heart. His heart that's not beating. 00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,130Okay,open the pericardium and aspirate. If the heart's still not beating,close and call it. What? You think we're defiling this man's body? Well,we're certainly doing more... than what? If they're dead or dying when they come through those doors, you hump,and hump hard. Why? For the experience. No,what else? There's something more. You think on that. It'll come to you. You know,mr. Hubble, you might make things a little easier on yourself if you would just tell us what you've ingest. We'll know anyway once we see your films. You have the most beautiful features. They're delicate. Almost porcelain. Mr. Hubble,whatever you've ingested could kill you. Are you sure you don't want to tell me what's got you blocked up inside? It might offend you. Is it drugs? It's not drugs. Mr. Hubble... i promise. It's not drugs. Okay. Well,good,i'm glad it's not drugs. It's drugs. Looks like at leasten balloons in his bowel. My guess cocaine. Scott seibert,18,no fractures or internal bleeding. Got pretty lucky. Recommendation? Keep overnight for observation. Damn. Lea seibert,43,multiple healed fractures on her clavicle and humerus,her third and fourth rib. She's either a bull rider or she's abused. Kid said the accident was road rage. His old man got cut off in traffic,went ballistic. Well,that's not the story i got. She has a large,yellowing bruise over her right kidney tender to palpitation. Said she got it from a fall last week. She's bleeding. Perinephric hematoma. What do you do? It should take care of itself. We'll keep an eye on it. She needs,uh,bed rest and a shrink. It's drugs. Stupid,stupid,stupid. One burst and he's dead in five minutes. Okay,what do we do? Run his bowel. And what does that mean? Yang? Uh,running the bowel entails removing all 36 feet of the intestine from the body cavity, hand searching for the balloons and then cutting them out. Grey,book an o.r. Yang,karev,you're in. Need all the hands i can get. Are you sure they're balloons? You have reason to believe they're not balloons? This one here's got a face. So does that one. They all do. I'll be damned. They're judys. Judys? He swallowed the heads of ten judy dolls. Eww. My mother used to buy me judy dolls... manhattan judy,surfer judy disco judy. I always wanted one. I dissected them,cut off their arms, and shaved their heads. Sounds like there's a sick and twisted story behind this. They're sexist,distorted devil toys that create unrealistic image expectations catering to the porn-driven minds of men. You swallow a bitter pill this morning,yang? They're dolls. Grey,call for a psych consult. And then see if he has family. Do i still book the o.r.? Blocked bowels become necrotic bowels. Check with dr. Burke,see if we can bump someone. Those judy's gotta come out today. Hanging another b-neg. He's going through a lot of blood. What's the word from u.n.o.s.? He's on the list,but they don't have a liver for him. The list won't help him now. We can work all day, but this liver won't stop bleeding. And it won't support his recovery from surgery. What about the donor from wilkeson that's coming in? That liver's already been committed. Mr. Siebert's only hope is a family donor. Maybe we should call it. No use in tying up an o.r. If we're just postponing the inevitable. How much work do you have here to complete,dr. Domner? Oh,mabe six hours. Then that's how much time we have to find him a new liver. You're the chief. any family members waiting? Still trying to reach them. Good. I mean,not good that we haven't reached them. It's just good i don't have to... it's always hard. yeah I'm sorry about alex. That's fine. It's good,you know. No need to talk about it. You do understand that i had sex with him before you,not during. Because when you and i were having sex... i understand. I just wanted to clear the air. Oh. It's clear. Perfectly clear... okay. And about the syphilis. We really don't have to talabout this. It's just,i mean,i didn't... i didn't know i had it. I should've. I'm a nurse. I mean,there was the sore. And i was all itchy. Okay,you know,i,uh,got it. You know,things happen. They... they really do. Things you wish you could change. Yeah. (pager beeps) It's the chief. I gotta take this. Sure. George. You have to call it. Call it? Him. Oh,um,time of death 1:48. I got it. This guy came in this morning with ten judy doll heads in his abdomen. Is that some kind of sick or what? I mean,when you think about it those things can't be that easy to swallow. If they still got their hair on them, that's some bad spaghetti. That dude's crapping toys. U know,when you're little you can hide. Ignore the shouting,the screaming, pretend like youe someplace else. Then when you get older,bigger, you feel like you should be doing something. Something to stop it. You know,to protect her. And when you can't, you don't know who to be angrier at... your old man or yourself. Usually it's yourself. Did she tell you? She didn't have to it's all over her films. He's not beating you,is he? No,just her. (elevator dings) So what do you do about the anger? Me? I think about the guy who eats doll heads. He's got problems. Hey,i've been looking for you guys. It's my father. Bob liked his beers. His liver started to fail a couple of years ago. He quit drinking,and we put him on the transplant list. But his blood type... "b" negative. There just aren't that many available. They suggested a family member. Any luck? My son. They said scotty's a good match. He's 18. Family members shouldn't do it out of obligation. It's a risky operation. Scotty's had counseling. You know,they just don't let you do it. He hasn't made his mind up yet,you know. I mean,we actually have a date set for the surgery. I just... i just don't... i don't want to pressure him. Well,then you shouldn't. Oh,god. Oh,god,i don't wanna lose bob. Look,we'll give your son as much time as we can to make a decision,okay? Would you care to explain? Seibert is a wife beater. Her films show years of abuse. I didn't know that. Multiple fractures. She has a kidney bleed from a beating she took last week plus it was... it was his road rage that caused the accident. The guy in the other car died. And that means what? No heroic measures? We leave him on the table? Well,if it were up to me... think like a surgeon,dr. Yang. We have a dying patient and a liver that could save him. Well,this is more complicated than that. For social workers,yes. For the family. Not for you. It isn't up to you. Yeah,you made that perfectly clear. Well,i'm glad we have an understanding. Yeah,i'm sure you are. R from wilkeson? Should be here at 3. Harvest team's on their way in. I also need to touch base with the transplant center about seibert's getting his son's liver. Dr. Burke. Dr. Bailey needs an o.r. And they're all booked. For? An emergent bowel obstruction. Drugs? Ten judy doll heads. Seriously? Yes. I can see their little faces. "Help! Let me out!" Bump warner's hernia in 1. But don't tell him what we're removing. Thank you. If he can't be here obsessing, he wants stuff to obsess with at home. I'll be done and out of your way in a moment. Intern time cards... sign. It's always something,isn't it? Some emergency surgery,some annoying administrative problem. Being chief is a lot like being an intern. The work never stops. When i found out richard had a tumor, you know what i felt? Relieved. I was hoping he would finally be forced to retire. Ah,that has your attention,doesn't it how we both would like for that to happen. I could finally book a vacation for two. You know,you're perfect for this job,preston... unattached,obsessive. This hospital,this job... it's enough for you,isn't it? It has to be today? He won't make it off the table with his own liver. He's bleeding a lot. When you get counseling,they tell you not to force it... the decision,you know? One day,one moment... you'll just know the right thing to do. It should be easy,right? He's my father. Well,it's a tough operation. I mean,it would be a big change in your life. The upside is that the liver's the only organ that regenerates itself. I mean,they're gonna only take half of yours and it'll be back to normal size in two months. You probably won't brunning any marathons anytime soon... dr. Stevens,can i see you outside for a moment? What is your problem? You're doing a sales pitch. The recipient is your patient. You shouldn't even be talking to the donor. The recipient is his father, who he's gonna lose if he doesn't make a decision. And he understands that,all right? Believe me,he understands that. You have no idea what's going on in that kid's head. None. Call three times a day. Do not call three times a day. And if my wife doesn't put you through... i won't put you through. Keep calling until she does. Yes,sir. He's not talking. It could be pica. But doubtful for a man his age. Maybe an oedipal complex or idolization of the dolls as partners. Or it could be that he simply enjoys it. You know,i've seen a lot of strange things in strange places,but how does he enjoy this? He 'd enjoy then when they came out. I didn't need to hear that. Dr. Grey,may i speak with you for a moment? Don't look at me for help. I assume he told you why he left me? Dr. Shepherd,with all due respect, this has nothing to do with me. Really? So you didn't take him back? Good girl. And in the future,i'd appreciate it if we could keep our relationship strictly professional. Meredith? Sometimes people do desperate things to get someone's attention. There are two sides to every story. (cristina) the father's an alcoholic wife beater. I mean,it shouldn't even be a question. Yeah,but if you could save somebody and didn't, wouldn't you feel like you were committing murder? Oh,yeah,like the guy did when he crashed into george's d.o.a.? He's the killer,not the son. Oh,that is sick. Who would do that? Ugh. Look,see judy fly. Hey,george. Hey. what? Geor... she was trying to make up with you. You should go eat with her. No. No,i shouldn't. She's cute and she likes you. You shouldn't let a little syph get in the way. It's not the syph. Oh,so the syph. It is not the syph. Then what is it? Oh. What? What is it? Out with it. The's this other girl. Izzie! Other girl? You have another girl? He hasn't told her yet that he likes her. Izzie,we are not in high school. George has a little crush. I do not have a crush. It is a thing. A thing that is very personal. One day,i'd like to build on this thing with this other girl... woman. She's all woman. What are you doing? I'm just playing with... no,george,with olivia? What are you doing with olivia? Oh,nothing. You're letting her think you're emotionally available. You're letting her think she has a chance. And there is nothing worse in the world than thinking you have a chance,when you really dot. Meredith is right. Tell her there's someone else. Tell her why,george. I mean,at least give her the chance to have some feelings about it for god's sake! why are you yelling at me ? Because i've got estrogen,george. Because of all the estrogen. so,new subject? It's a mess. No,it isn't. I think i know a mess when i see a mess. You've got the harvest tying up o.r. 1. siebert tying up o.r. 2. Bowel obstruction,o.r. 3... it's simply a bit crowded. Well,your "crowded" is my "seriously overbooked." And in my book,"seriously overbooked" is a mess. (pager beeps) They need to know if there's any word on the seibert liver. How much work do they have left? A couple of hours. Well,tell him i'll be in to see them. You bumped me for a bowel obstruction? Oh,uneasy lies the head that wears the chief's cap. Was it an act of desperation? Not at all. Something to attra attention? Of course not. I'm just trying to understand here,mr. Hubble. Why ten doll heads? Well,'cause eleven would've been too much. I think it has something to do with his mother. Maybe she always wanted a girl and gave him judy dolls for his birthday presents. Aha,i got another one. Doyen clamps to yang. Grey,push the head up to the incision. Maybe his mother looked like judy and he was into voodoo. Instead of sticking pins in... ah,black judy. Before they gave her long hair. Back when she had the afro. She came with go-go boots and a leather jacket. That's a shame. It's a real collector's item. Collectible dolls... a new twist. Seriously,you can identify these dolls by their heads? You got a problem with that,yang? I like judy dolls. I own judy dolls. The only problem i have with judy dolls is that they're in the bowel of this man. Bailey,i need an intern in the e.r. To meet the harvest donor. O'malley. See ya,turbo. You good here? A couple of more heads to go. Then karev,stevens,yang,scrub out. You need to get an answer from seibert's son. Okay. Ah,yes,mod judy. She came with a yellow vespa. You know what's strange? We haven't had enough strange? She looks a little like you. This is the donor from wilkeson general. Just put her in here until the harvest team comes down. Thanks. Well,at least this one's heart is still beating. I think bailey would want me to... we finally reached the family of the dead motorist. They live in portland. Should be here in a few hours. Want me to page you when they get here? Yeah,do they know? Only that we were still working on him. I thinit's better to hear bad news first hand. I know i'd like to talk to the doctor who called it. Get some answers. So that i could get on with my life. Uh... george... d you... did you see that? She's decerebrate. Her brain's... her brain stem's still alive. Um... okay,we'll take it from here. Thanks. Would you look at this? She's decerebrate. Okay. Yeah,she can't really be declared brain dead. It's a small reaction. They probably just missed it. The cortex is dead. The brain stem will follow. Death is imminent. We just have to wait it out. Yeah,but don't you... she'll be dead by the time we get to the o.r.,doctor. But she's... she's alive now. (knocks on door) It smells like a hospital in here. What are we doin' with this guy,preston? Is this just an exercise? I don't need the practice. The transplant committee gave us the green light. I'm tryin' to get an answer from the son. Well,this guy's goin' through blood like there's no tomorrow,and i mean that literally. How much work do you have left now? mabe an hour and a half. But without a liver, i don't think this guy's gonna last that long. I need to speak to scotty. I can talk to him. I need to talk to him. I think they want him to make the decision on his own. You think i'm sick for wanting to save my husband, don't you? I think... your feeling very emotional, and when we're feeling emotional, sometimes it's... sometimes it's hard to keep a vel head and consider all the facts. Your husband killed a man on the highway today. He almost killed you and your son. Those are the facts. Have you ever been in love,doctor? Have you? Love has its limits. dr. Shepherd. Dr. O'malley. I was just in i.c.u. With the harvest donor. And dr. Bailey,she has us do exams and procedures on patients, even if they're dead. What'd you find? Uh,she's decerebrate. The donor... her brain stem is still alive. excuse me. I'm derek shepherd,head of neurosurgery. You mind if i take a look? Okay,yeah,uh,she's still posturing. We have every intention of waiting until she's dead. She's in an irreversible coma. Hines,the neuro at wilkeson ran the protocol. They missed decerebration. What else did they miss? She has a tumor on her,uh... brain stem,right? I don't see an m.r.i. Did you do an e.e.g. To confirm brain death? Yeah,according to hines. I don't know dr. Hines. We have six patients in three states waiting for this woman's organs. Yeah,and i'm sure they'd all be happy to know that the organs they're receiving are from somebody who's actually brain dead. No one's gonna touch her while she 's alive. For you to imply otherwise... is there a problem here,dr. Orsen,dr. Shepherd? Yeah,we have a donor who's still decerebrate. And? And I wanna do an e.e.g. and  an  m.r.r. (orsen) An expensive waste of time. I insist on it. You insist on it? I do. Well,if my head of neurosurgery says he needs an e.e.g. And an m.r.i., he needs an e.e. G and an m.r.i. You realize we have six patients waiting? That is not my call,dr. Orsen. Who gets the organs is up to u.n.o.s. Who donates the organs is up to the families. Hell,i got a guy in the o.r. That's waiting for a liver that may not even deserve to be saved, and agai that's not my call. But you wanna know what my call is? Everything else. The patient is yours,dr. Shepherd. Thank you,dr. Burke. Dr. O'malley,you want to assist with this m.r.i.? First thing we'll do is an e.e.g. George,you with me? (scott) what if he goes back to hitting her? You can't make that call,but whatever you do, you can't make the decision out of anger. Alex, So what do you do with it? What'd you do with yours? Alex! Hey,you shouldn't be out here. Dr. Burke needs... can you just back off,please? My anger had a life of its own. I bulked up,became a wrestler, and the next time he laid a hand on my mother, i beat the living crap out of him. When he got out of the hospital, he took off. He just took off and never came back. I mean,he was a cold,mean-tempered bastard, but he was still my old man,you know? And then now... now i can't stop wishin' that i'd never laid a hand on him... that we somehow could've worked it through. What is it? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. L... what? What does burke want? I'm sorry,scott. He needs a decision now. When would it happen? We would take scotty to pre-op immediately. The transplant surgeon is on call and waiting. There isn't much time. Scotty... scotty... yeah,okay. I wanna do it. (burke) let's get him to pre-op. I'll call the surgeon. But i have a couple of conditions. You're gonna tell the cops the truth about what happened in this accident,mom. And... as soon as we get back home, you and i are moving out. Enough is enough. (burke)... donor,no transmittable diseases. E.t.a. About ten minutes. You know she's just gonna go back to him. No,i don't know that. And that's not my... this is not our call. Look,cristina... i was wondering,uh,i mean,uh... i was hoping that we can,uh... i know we didn't... you're asking me... are you okay? Can i scrub in? Then,yes,dr. Burke,i'm okay. Karev,let's get him to pre-op. You see the tumor on her brain stem right here? It looks pretty bad. U ever had a crappy day,o'malley? I mean,really,really crappy. I have had many crappy days. This one just got better. You might as well go home,gentlemen. I will be the only one of us performing surgery here today. My friend here has a viable brain. Okay. Do you really think she'll be okay? If i get the tumor out, she's got a good shot at recovery. Look out for her. Meredith? Yeah. is that the family of the dead guy? Yeah. Look,maybe i'm not over the alex thing or the syph thing yet. That... that's not really the problem. There's a girl who i,uh... and it doe't matter that there's this other guy, and frankly,i wouldn't care if she gave me the ebola virus. I like you,olivia. But... i just don't like you enough. I gave it a shot,right? And you were honest. That's good. You know what you're gonna tell them? Why do we hump on every dead or dying patient that comes through those doors? Experience? So we can tell their family that we did everything we could. Are you ted's family? yeah,yeah,we're ted's family. just when the day was improving. You told meredith what happened. I did. What'd you tell her? Sometimes people do desperate things to attract attention. What? Wow. So that's your side of this, that i didn't pay you enough attention? Was that what you were thinking when you got naked with my best friend? No,by that point,i wasn't thinking at all,derek. By that point,i was just scratching an itch. We got successful,you and me. We got busy and we got lazy. We didn't even bother to fight anymore,derek. And mark was there,and i missed you. And now i'm sorry. I'm more sorry than you could possibly imagine, but at least i'm talking to you about it. Derek... i'm a sink with an open drain,addie. did you get them all? Yes. It wasn't easy or very pleasant. How do you feel? Empty. I feel empty now. Yeah,i've been feeling a little bit of that myself lately. I could see that. mr. Hubble, why does eating doll heads fill you up? What's the satisfaction? Do you really wanna know? Would it be too much information? It might. Maybe i'm better left in the dark. There's something to be said about a glass half full... about knowing when to say when. i think it's a floating line, a barometer of need and desire. it's entirelyup to the individual... and depends on what's being poured. sometimes... all we want is a taste. other times, there's no such thing as enough.
