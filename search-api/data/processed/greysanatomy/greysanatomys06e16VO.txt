Our patients live because we enjoy following the steps. But as we much as we'd love to always rely on the numbers... The plan... We also know that some of the greatest medical discoveries Have happened by accident. Karev, you still need a lift to--oh, my-- oh, my god! What are you doing?! Get out! Uh... Wh-why are you naked? Oh. I should go. God. No, please don't be mad. Derek was supposed to be alex. Okay. Well, alex left ten minutes ago. And since when are you two still-- Since you caught us the first time. Mm-hmm. Lexie, this is alex we're talking about. Emotionally, he's like me three years ago. You can't be having feelings for him. You realize that. Yeah, of course not. No. It's--it's just sex. Okay? There's no feelings involved. Right. Because you are a no-feelings type of girl. Your heart lives in your vagina. It... does not. Okay? I swear. It's... not this time. Okay. Sure. My heart does not live in my... vagina. Mold--penicillin. Poisonous tree bark-- A cure for malaria. Morning. Morning. A little blue pill for high blood pressure... Impotence be damned. What's going on? Huh? Gotta go. Oh, my god! Dude! Why is this my morning? So I flip the patient into trendelenburg. Teddy yanks out the arterial cannula... And connects the arterial line to a venous line, And then sets up retrograde cerebral perfusion. I mean, like, she was on fire. I was on fire. The whole o.R. Was on fire. What? Nothing. Nothing. Just... you two are... You two are friends now. Yeah. And hey, you know... yocan be her friend, too. I never asked you not to be. You decided that all on your own. So... be her friend. It's hard for us to accept That it's not always the hard work... thank you. Or attention to detail That'll give us the answers we're looking for. Dr. Hunti-- I just paged you. Uh, there's a trauma on the way. Here it is. We've got a 41-year-old motorcycle daredevil With a closed head wound, penetrating neck wound And multiple blunt traumas. What was the dare? Riding without a helmet apparently. He's still got some brain waves left, but barely. Oh! But sometimes we just have to sit back, Relax and wait for the happy accident. Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! That isn't gonna help. Mnh-mnh. I'm on trauma today,yang. This one's mine. I touched him first. Gary from legal. I need a statement from one of you about that fall. You two decide. You're not even wearing scrubs. Damn it. This is not over. Have fun with gary from legal. Okay. One... Two, three. Teddy, hey. I have an old patient up in oncology. And I know that you're really busy with surgeries And st-staring at owen hunt... What? I've tried to ignore it, the staring. But ever since christmas, with the guitar and the singing And the stolen looks--well, I noticed it, and I can't...Unnotice it. It's just, I kinof... I like to fix things--people. I like to fix people. Oh, no, no. Dr. Hunt and I-- ooh, don't, 'cause then you're just lying, and that's no good My point is, you're staring and you're sad. And I think that you need friends that aren't owen. And that's where I come in, with the fixing. You're going to be friends with me. I am? Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm an awesome friend. So tonight you'll come out with callie and me--girls' night. Maybe bailey will come, too. Say yes to girls' night. Yes to girls' night. Yay! Oh, yay. Problem solved. Now for my patient. Elliot meyer. He needs a lung transplant. Oh, hey. Uh, I'm down with a l-lung transplant. Oh, no... because you slept with my girlfriend, And I find at when I look at you, I want to hit you with a brick. Dude, that was, like, years ago. Maybe, but jealousy's a green-eyed monster, And if you ask any one of my kids, they'll tell you, There's no reasoning with a monster. Dude, run away before I find a brick. As my new friend, don't judge me for that. So... my patient, been treated... I get it. You're upset little sloan is gone. But screwing drug reps is not gonna make you feel better. Yeah, it is. No screwing drug reps in my hospital. Are we clear? You were much more fun when you weren't chief. You know that? Get outta here. Ah. Dr. Webber. Welcome back. Oh. Thank you, dr. Sloan. Richard, how's your first day back? Uh, well, so far, so good. I had to drop this off. I'm sorry you have to do this. Well, this drug testing, it's part of the rehab program. Just run it under a john doe, would you? Of course. Whatever you need today, richard, and I mean that. A low-stress day, let's start there-- Routine surgeries, a light schedule, home by 5:00. Done. Yeah, I said that. She slipped. The only person liable here is you For keeping me from my surgery. Call my driver and tell him there's still time Toake my flight if he comes straight here. You passed out in a restaurant and you have abdominal pain. You're not getting on a plane. The pain's gone, and whatever caused it Can wait till I get home. Now let me off of this damn thing. We're done here, right? Sir, I need you to move to this gurney. I got this, yang. All right? You're not even in scrubs. Sir, I need you to stay calm so I can do a proper examination. Tell this lady to back off, jackie. Jackie? Whatever. It's not-- Look, I've already paged bailey, and he's not cardio. So you can lose interest, yang. Yeah, we'll see about that. Sir, I'm a surgeon, a very good one. So is my grandson. So why don't you take your hands off me? Wait, he's your grandfather? I'm serious, okay? I can handle this till bailey gets here. No, because you're not allowed to treat family members, And he has midepigastric tenderness and guarding. It could be ascending cholangitis. Ascending cholgitis? Really? With only one of the symptoms of charcot's triad? You're a doctor? Apparently a much better one than you are. Dr. Harper avery. And your name, doctor? Harper avery. Uh, no. That's my name. As in the harper avery award? Bingo. Get a new surgeon, jackie, One with a pulse this time. You're harper avery's grandson? I misdiagnosed harper avery in front of harper avery. Do you know what that does to my chances Of one day winning a harper avery? Well, could die before then. I mean, he could die today even. I just need to operate on my motorcycle daredevil guy, And I'll be fine. Is it true harper avery is here? So derek walked in on her naked this morning In alex's bed. Meredith! What? Oh, I'm just cheering her up. She's having a bad day. Be generous. You know what? You can't be having feelings for karev. He's like meredith three years ago. I said that. I don't have feelings for alex. Yes, you do. Your heart's, like, in your vagina. I said that. Oh, my god. You are both monsters. We're like... Yang, I heard you met harper avery. Did you know that pretty boy's grandfather was god? I didn't know. That is kinda cool, though. No, it's not cool. Okay, he's an entitled brat with no skills Except a really good bloodlin It is not jackson's fault that he's related to harper avery. Oh, whatever, ellis grey's daughter. Huh? How do I look? Chiefly? What, are you nervous? He's one of the most powerful surgeons in the country. He's just a guy Who happens to have an award named aft him. Whatever,Ellis grey's daughter. Admit it. You want to meet him, too. Ll, yeah. Thank you. Hey,here are we on him? He was on his way up to the o.R. When he started bleeding out. Want to give us a hand here, yang? Oh. Big boy needs a little help. No problem. Watch and learn. Clamp. See? This is why I don't want you to drive! I had to get my medication! The store was gonna close! I'm so- -can we not yell? Please. Maybe. No, actually. My mother's almost completely deaf, A fact she refuses to accept, which is why She won't learn sign language or get a hearing aid. So we yell. Don't talk to her. Talk to me. I'm just telling them what happened! She stole my car... again. There's a tenderness over the zygomatic process And a hematoma to the left temporal area. Okay. Run a head and face c.T. I'll get sloan and shepherd. She's got a ruptured tendon in her knee that will need surgery. So she'll be off her feet for a few weeks. So more waiting on her hand and foot? Brilliant. I saw that, kathy! They're taking you for scans! That's all we said! Just quiet down. Let the nice doctor do her work. Why is this taking so long?! Is it me or are those two women terribly annoying? My apologies, dr. Avery. We're working on getting you up to your own room As soon as poss- you said that before. Are you the same shepherd Who did the clinical trial on the gliomas? Yes, sir. You brought me a neurosurgeon for some abdominal cramps? No, I-I--dr. Shepherd is our chief of surgery, sir. I don't need a cruise director. I need an experienced surgeon. Page dr. Grey. I'm dr. Grey. Either the world's most talented plastic surgeon works here Or you're not ellis grey. She was my mother. She passed away. I-I didn't know. Uh, my condolences. Who else then? Does, uh, richard webber still work here? Yes. unfortunately, he is, uh, he is not available today. Push 2 of ativan. Percy, let's get him on his side. Cristina, watch that neck. Oh,my god! What are they doing to that man?! Oh! Okay. Applying pressure. Get him back into the room. I'll page dr. Webber. As you can see, you've got dilated bowel here and here, Indicating an obstruction. It's a good thing that our young dr. Avery Brought you straight in. Dr. Bailey can do the surgery right away. Was it a student, webber? A board member's wife? What? No one gives up a chief of surgery gig, And, uh, they don't ask you unless it's for something juicy. So who were you slipping it to? Grandpa! I'm sorry, dr. Webber. It was a joke. He doesn't get me. So, webber? Uh, dr. Webber decided to focus on his research. Oh, the research line. Well, either way, At least you'll be free to do my surgery. Dr. Bailey is more than capable of performing the surgery-- I want webber. No offense. None taken. And I want to watch. What? I'm going to be awake for my surgery, watch. So much for the low-stress day. Mm. A year after mr. Meyer's lymphoma went into remission, He was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, A condition that he developed as a side effect To the radiation he received during his cancer treatments. This isn't new information. I thought you said you could help. Yeah, but they're new to the case, And it's important to review the entire history. Great. Uh, can't you do that on your own time? Jill. Sorry. My sister usually waits a few more minutes Before going full bitch on new guys. All right. Let me tell you what I know. It is gonna be very difficult to find you a new set of lungs. Donor lungs are scarce. 85% get thrown out Because they get too inflamed while the donor is brain dead. And because your cancer could come back With the immunosuppressants you'd be on, You are considered a very high-risk candidate. There are just too many other patients on the list That are lower risk. Elliot survived leukemia and lymphoma. Nobody does that, but he did. He deserves lungs. Unfortunately, these are the rules The transplant board sets out. I... I'm sorry. Dr. Altman, have you looked into the research they're doing With ex vivo transplants? Ex vivo? Well, it's a procedure where they take damaged donor lungs-- The ones we would normally throw away-- And repair them on bypass. Are we doing one? Let me guess. You want on my service to make up for the fact That you humiliated yourself in front of harper avery. How'd you hear about that? You made fun of me. Okay. Fine. Yes, I-I humiliated myself in front of harper avery. And my daredevil gorked before we could operate on him. So I am available for your ex vivo lung case. I don't have an ex vivo lung case Because it's only been done in switzerland and in canada On patients in much better shape than our patient. Yes, but... Okay, performing a procedure as hard-core as this While harper avery is in the hospital? Well, I mean, he could hear about it and like it And--and he's a god who hands out awards. Yeah, I don't care about awards. Oh, come on. Only people who never win awards ever say that. So you think this could be an ex vivo lung case? I do not have feelings for alex. I do not care. Ah, here we go. He's giving them the speech. What speech? About the wonders of medicine. About how as surgeons, you know, We're meant to push boundaries And do what no one has ever done. Sounds motivating. It's cheesy is what it is. And you hear it enough times at your grandparents' dinner table, You can't help but want to be a surgeon when you grow up. You had a dinner table? I didn't know world-class surgeons had dinner tables. I feel gyped. Well, that's 'cause you haven't heard the speech yet. ...to be awake for my own surgery, But an opportunity like this, to be a student again, Get a new perspective-- It's what we got into this business for In the first place-- Those moments that challenge and terrify and dare us To reach the potential that we were meant to reach. No, let's stop the talk And get into that o.R. And teach those kids, Teach ourselves... What it means to be great. I'm sorry. I can't authorize an awake surgery, no matter-- We can do it. Derek, we can do this. That's what I like to hear. That's the way a chief does things. Shepherd, take note. Dr. Webber. Derek, I know what you're gonna say-- No. As the sole person in this hospital Assigned to look out for your welfare, I don't support this decision. I apologize... Chief shepherd. You really want to do this thing? I do. It's on you, then. Thank you for your help on that project. Uh-huh. Same time tomorrow? Yeah. Oh, let me guess. Still no call from little sloan. Nothing. But it's okay. I've moved on. Okay. Yeah, getting out of bed And not wearing sweats around the apartment all day Is a sign of progress. Sleeping with the nurses? Not so much. Well, I wouldn't have to sleep with nurses If you'd put out. I'm in a committed, loving adult relationship. Tried that. Didn't work. Okay, whatever. Just come take a look at this face c. T. On my patient. Come on. Get the hell outta here, karev. What? Get the hell out. Now! What was that? I don't like that guy. Oh, he slept with lexie once, mark. You two were broken up. Actually, he's, uh... never mind. You don't sleep with another man's girl. I learned that the hard way. Oh, well played. Oh, don't buy that. He's acting out because He can't deal with the real human emotions he's having. Ask him how many nurses he's slept with today. You're sleeping with nurses now? You said no drug reps. And I'm a grown man. I can screw whoever I want. Not in my hospital. What are you gonna do, fire me? Maybe I will. All right. All right. Enough with the testosterone. Mrs. Nelson's scans are up. No bleed. No fracture. She's good. She's deaf. Yeah. How'd you know that? She's got otosclerosis-- Abnormal bone growth in the middle ear. If I just remove the bones, she'll be able to hear again. Wait. You can restore her hearing? Yeah. But she's been deaf for years. Yeah. She doesn't have to be. Just because you removed the bone? What'd I just say? She doesn't have to be deaf anymore. I can fix it. I'm that good. You still want to fire me? Not a bad looking bowel, is it, webber? No, sir. If I had to guess, I would say it was the bowel of a 50 year old. Suction, dr. Grey. Dr. Grey, I've got a question for you. It's of a personal nature. Yes, sir? If your mother was still working here, Would you have chosen to, uh, Study at a-a different, lesser quality hospital In order to avoid the advantages of her legacy? I'm waiting here, dr. Grey. Um... dr. Webber, What do you think about intraoperational dye To help determine intestinal viability? Uh, well, they say that it enhances clinical judgment. I'm not real sure. I don't get it. Why does he get to scrub in On his own grandfather's awake surgery? The same reason why harper avery personally requested Meredith grey to be his resident. Nepotism sucks. Hey, you, uh, want to go grab a bite? No. Actually, I am... full. Really? 'cause you didn't seem full last night. I said no. Okay, I-I-I am not hungry at all. So just go eat alone. Excuse me. Sorry. Hey, down in front, bigfoot. Oh, it's bigfoot now. Well, you know what they say about guys with big feet. Shouldn't you be off learning how to be a surgeon After you let my daredevil die? My daredevil? He didn't die. After you left, I personally helped preserve his heart function. Now he's an organ donor. B.P.'s DROPPING. I think I've got a bleeder. Suction. Did you check the s.M.A. ? Yes, it's okay. Dr. Avery, stay calm. I'll be calm when you find the damn thing. What's going on, kathy? You're serious? All this time, I just needed to make her go to the doctor? Well, that doesn't matter now. What matters is that dr. Sloan can do the surgery Right after I operate on the knee. That accident might have been the best thing That ever happened to you. What's going on? Who are you? You're like some miracle worker or something. Thank you. Thank you so much. What the hell is going on? Mom... Dr. Sloan can give you your hearing back! Don't you dare sleep with that woman. No? What?! No. Dr. Sloan, come and tell her yourself. Mrs. Nelson! I'm dr. Sloan! I have some very good news for you! Okay, shouldn't we put him out? No, don't put me out. Hang another unit of f.F.P. 80 over 50. There it is. There it is. I've got it. I've got it. Okay. How are you feeling, dr. Avery? Okay. Heart rate's stabilizing. Hang in there just a few more minutes, okay? 3-0 silk, boki. Silk? No, use chromic. Don't get lazy on me. Yep, he's fine. Right. Chromic instead, boki. You paged? Oh, my god. Are you doing an ex vivo lung repair? My daredevil turned out to be a match. You stole his lungs? No, I did not steal them. The transplant team rejected them And were gonna send them to medical waste, So I just redirected them to medical research. Now does lexopedia want to be badass And help me on this thing or not? Oh, my god. Yeah. Okay, so I ventilated the lungs With, uh, c-o-2 and nitrogen from the pump. Hey. Hey. Um, you hear about harper- I heard about your motorcycle--oh. You go. No. Sorry. You go. Uh, I was just gonna say, it's kinda cool, Uh, harper avery being here. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it is. And, uh, uh, your-- your motorcycle guy? Oh, we lost him, but he's a donor. Well, that's good. You know, you should come over sometime for dinner. Uh, cristina--she-- well, she doesn't cook, But if you remember, I do a mean lasagna. Sure. Really? Yeah, yeah. Sounds fun. Okay. Uh, I gotta go. All right, yeah. Uh, talk to you later. Mm-hmm. Okay, I know you love yang. She gives you the warm and fuzzies With her magical, special heart skills. But those lungs you're transplanting Belonged to a patient of mine. And it would mean a lot to turn his death Into something meaningful- I'm sorry. What lungs? You went behind my back. You used my name. Yes, yes, but we followed the protocol. We didn't tell the patient. You stole lungs, cristina! Which they were about to throw out. She was being green. Oh, well, great. Then I don't have to worry About the thousands of dollars that you spent And the fact that no one in this hospital Has ever tried this before. Oh, my god. This is about harper avery, isn't it? That's why you did this? Why is that such a bad thing? Okay, the point is, is that we could-- You can pull this surgery off. Oh, wow, thank you. I mean, who needs a harper avery when they've got The cristina yang seal of approval? That's not what I was saying. All of this ambition of yours, This desperate need to win prizes, It means your priorities are off. Hey. It doesn't. Prizes push us to be better. They push us to be monsters. Hey. Oh, so the status quo- not trying then--that's worse. Hey! The lungs--look. They're--they're viable. A transplant th repaired lungs Has never been done in the united states. The risks are tremendous, And with the amount of radiation that you sustained, There's no way of knowing how friable your tissue is Or if you can even sustain a transplant. Wait. I'm sorry. Are you saying you recommend it, though? No, they're saying They want to give us a pair of hand-me-down lungs-- The ones no one else wants. These are good lungs. This procedure has allowed us to repair them So they're virtually the same as- no! We'll wait. We'll wait until you get the lungs that you deserve. You're so used to fighting, you don't even realize... This is it. I am sick and I'm tired And I am ready. No matter what happens, my affairs are in order. Your affairs are not in order. Don't you dare say that. Dr. Robbins, please. Is this my best shot? I'm not your surgeon here, elliot. I have to defer to dr. Altman. It's your only shot. Then, yes. Do it. Give me the hand-me-downs. Dr. Sloan, good timing. Dr. Karev and I are pretty much done. What the hell you looking at? Nothing, I was just-- Get out of my o.R., karev. Mark, you're way out of line here. It's fine. I'll go. He's got serial killer eyes. I'm almost done here anyway. You sure? Yeah. That is enough. Hey, it's funny. Did you see the guy's face? No, it is sad and pathetic. Okay? And you have a choice here. Sloan and her baby leaving you can either be the worst Or the best thing that happened to you. You can grown up, find a woman to love and have a baby. Or you can be the ass attending who abuses the residents And screws whatever walks into this hospital. So just pick one. Would you drape the ear, please? Look, it's not gonna happen, all right? Come on, man. Five minutes with your grandpappy. That's all I ask. Right, 'cause the two of us are such good friends. Well, this would go a long way to help that. Back off, karev, if anybody's a friend here, It's me. You're not meeting him either. Dude, what happened to mercy west forever? That was never a thing. Now leave. I hate it. I hate it when they know I'm related to him-- The way they treat me, The way they watch me as soon as they find out. And I know the name has... helped, But he is not easy. Brilliant, but really not easy to be related to. It's him. 9-1-1. What is it? You paged? Are you okay? We never got a chance to finish our talk from this morning. Our talk? What, are you kidding me? And you brought dr.Grey. That's good, actually. Answer me this time, dr. Grey. If a spot was being held for you to study At the greatest hospital in this country, Would you turn it down? A spot? Well-- Yeah, he saved a spot for me at mass gen, Ever since I graduated, Which is the only reason he came to visit-- To try to convince me to take it again. It's an incredible opportunity. An opportunity I don't want. I don't want to work for you. I don't want your help. I don't--look, it's enough-- no! I decide when I've said enough. I--you--you think I am arrogant and overbearing, And you've made that very clear, and maybe I am. But I am also your only living grandfather. And it has become very clear to me today That my time is coming. I don't--I can't l-leave-- leave-- Grandpa? Grandpa? V-tach. No pulse. No pulse here. We need a crash cart in here. Now! Your c.T. Shows that the's been a c complication. Dr. Webber will take you back into the o.R. And fix it right away. Fine, but you're not putting me out. Clearly a mistake was made. I'm not letting that happen again. That's not gonna happen this time. You're in my hospital today. You will abide by my rules. That means you go under general. Your grandson will be sitting in the waiting room as family. You refuse, and I will personally declare you unfit To make decisions regarding your own care. That is how a chief does things. Take note. Have bailey do the surgery. Richard-- Look, it could've been my mistake in there, derek. Do you understand what this would mean, Making an error on this man? I wanna drink, Not operate, not hold another man's life in my hands. So please... let bailey do it. Bailey will assist. Two months ago, You never would've told me you wanted a drink. You woulda had one. You can do this, richard. I get it. You got used to being the one person she could count on. And suddenly, you're supposed to just move on, Get a life that doesn't involve Taking care of the one person you thought needed you. It's hard. Okay. Yeah. Except, no, I am not gonna miss taking care of her. I wasted years of my life and I was miserable. But now... I can do anything. Right?I mean, I could... I could move out... Get my own place... Have men over... Men that look like you. I was taking care of you, you little tramp. Mom? No one asked you to move in. You were getting a divorce. You had no place to go. So you came home. I didn't need you to take care of me. I was fine, happy. But I let you, because I was taking care of you. You heard all that? Mom, you can hear. I can? Yeah. Oh, my god. I can. I can! Say something. Say something else. Okay, uh... I'm moving out, mom. I heard that. Oh, sorry. Damn it. What is it? The tissue is falling apart. The clamp's not holding. Get me some umbilical tape. This is why I hate awards. They don't make us better, Just more competitive and stupid. And for what? To put on a dress and eat a bad piece of fish And take home an ugly paperweight That's gonna sit on your mantel For the rest of your sad, empty, misguided life. You could do an interposition vein graft. What? You have something to add, dr. Yang? No, just... You've already gotten this far. You could repair the p. A. With a graft. Maybe. No. I could do a pericardial patch. I could use his pericardium to do the repair. We could start cooling him. And arrest the heart. How are we doing on time, grey? Cold ischemic time- three hours so far. Which means that we still have enough time To save the lungs if we hurry. All right, yang, get in there and help me. Clamp. Good. Here we go. His bowels are all swollen and hardened. The anastomosis is leaking. Which explains why he went into shock. All in all, I'd say this is about the best news We could've asked for, dr. Webber. I don't understand. His bowels are perforated. He's leaking intestinal contents. Because dr. Avery was allergic to the chromic suture. He didn't know because he was always wearing gloves In his own surgeries. And you couldn't have known either-- Which is why I am smiling behind this mask. Get the 3-0 silk ready, boki. Okay. This is it. Let's take him off bypass And see if these lungs can work on their own. Clamping. There. Come on. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe, damn it. I just spent the past five hours Trying to be okay with the fact That my only brother was dead. And... Now you're saying it worked? He's gonna be okay? Barring any complications. He's gonna be okay, yes. Would you like to see him? Yeah. Okay, come on. Hey. So he's fine. It was an allergy caused by the suture. It was his fault, then? Wow. That's awesome. Why don't they publish that story? Yeah, I know. I get it. The famous grandfather, The legacy he's trying to force on you, And you didn't ask for any of it- -trust me, I get it. You're putting up walls and you're avoiding him And you don't want to introduce him to your friends. It was the same with my mother. But if she were here right now in a room upstairs, I would want to go see her and make things right with her. And I definitely would want to go learn from her. And you still can. Guess who just helped save a guy's life By suggesting a highly experimental, Awesome procedure-- did you tell sloan we were together? What? Look, I like you, and you're a great time in bed, But don't go telling your ex we're together So you can make him jealous. I did not tell mark that we were together. And I am not trying to make him jealous. Yeah, right. I'M GETTING KICKED OUT OF O. R.S FOR A REASON. For once in my life-- for once-- I am doing something that is only for me. And it has nothing to do with me having feelings for you Or for mark or anyone, really. This is about not feeling. You make me not feel. A-and if you can't handle that, If you can't handle being used for sex, Then please just tell me so that I can find a guy who can. I'm all about not feeling. You've been through a lot. I-I-- Look, don't get all mushy on me. I'm just saying, we're on the same page. And I got a free 20 minutes. You want to go not have feelings somewhere? It's really bad form to cancel plans with new friends. You know that, right? I'll meet you in 15. So, uh, I heard about the lung transplant. Cristina said that you were amazing. No, cristina was amazing. aaaaaaaaa Want to grab a beer, celebrate? I was gonna head to joe's. I've got plans, actually. Ladies' night. I'm--I'm a little scared. I'll see you tomorrow, hunt. No matter how many plans we make or steps we follow... See you tomorrow. We never know how our day is going to end up. We'd prefer to know, of course, What curve balls will be thrown our way. Karev! Look, dude, she's not my girlfriend. So whatever business you two have to work out-- I'll stop. THE YELLING, THE THROWING YOU OUT OF O.R.S, IT'S OVER.
