Well, you're looking all thoughtful. I was just thinking how pretty you are... and also how pretty our children would be. Children? Like, multiple? Child. Let's just start with one and see how that goes. You wanna start? I'm just saying, you're pretty. That's all I'm saying. That every relationship we have is really just another version of that first relationship. Have you talked to Dr. Wyatt? Christina ... when's the last time you... it's just us trying over and over again to get it right. - Alex. - Mer? Okay, so izzie's not here, and Christina's not answering her phone, and I have a thing.  So I need you to be a girl for me. What'd he do?  You want me to kick his ass? He wants me to have a baby. So you do want me to kick his ass. - Alex. - Do you want to have a baby? A baby doesn't want me. I had the worst mother in the world. I would be the worst mother in the world. Izzie wants to divorce. She sent the papers-- The official papers. Want me to kick her ass? Hey, Alex. Hey. He's being a girl for me. - Dude, it's true. - Right. Well, there's a guy downstairs says he's your brother. You want me to send him up here to the bathroom since this seems to be where you receive your visitors? Uh, tell him to wait. Right. You have a brother? Yeah.  Do you want me to go get rid of him? Crap! What's he doing here? Alex is the oldest, then me and then Amber. Amber's graduating from St. Savior's in May. She's... she's smart, like Alex. She could go to college if she wanted to, but she's like, "What's the point?" you know? And I don't know what to tell her. Alex is the doctor in the family.  I just move people for a living. - Hey.  What are you doing here? - Man. You got old. Hey. Dude, uh, what are you doing here? I had to drive to Portland on a job, and since I was in the neighborhood... well, Portland's not in the neighborhood. It's three hours.  I do three hours in my sleep. Alex, he's your brother.  He's allowed to come say hi. You're gonna be late for pre-rounds. Okay.  Well, it--it was very nice to meet you.  I'm Lexie by the way. I'm overdue for a visit.  It's been seven years. No, it has not. Since you've been home.  Seven years. - You haven't been home in seven years? - Derek. I have this. - Mm-hmm. Hey I'm Derek.  Nice meeting you. - Aaron. Take care. I'll see you. -Meredith, by the way. -Hello. -Nice to meet you. Has it been seven years? Amber was 10 the last time we saw you. Aaron, what's going on? What do you want? I do miss you, okay? And I-I did want to say hi, but since you're a doctor, I thought I'd ask... should I be worried about this? Grey's Anatomy S06E19 Sympathy for the Parents - Thank you. Cappuccino. - Cappuccino. So... how'd the date go with Teddy? I don't know if I'd call it a date. Doesn't going on a date imploy actually going somewhere? Oh, shut up. You had sex? - Hey, guys. - Hey. Oh! Pound cake. - I love pound cake. - Thank you. Rich, buttery pound cake. Mm. Yum. Pound cake. - Pound cake? - Oh, I'm good. Thanks. So what exactly constitutes a pound cake? It's a yellow cake... There you go. Kinda heavy. Come on.  Code for something dirty, right? Like "You eat her pound cake. She eats your pound cake"? No. Oh, please tell me it's dirty, because otherwise, that was the most boring conversation I've ever been a part of. We are talking about pound cake because I want a kid, and she doesn't, and we're not talking about that. How long are you two not gonna have that conversation-- a year, two years, five? Wow. So... You and Teddy ate pound cake together. - You're changing the subject - You like how I did that? So how was it? - Mind-Blowing. - Yeah? I pounded her cake. She pounded mine. - Good - Excellent pound caking. "Pound caking" is not a thing. Whatever. I blew her mind. Life-changing? Life-changing, earth-shattering. the point is, he's a legend for a reason. I mean, he has skills that I never even knew existed. It was like there was a-a party going on. - A party in your panties. - Oh. Morning. - Good morning. - Hi Okay, bye. - Bye. - See ya. He's always so grumpy. He's going through something, and Cristina doesn't get it. She can't which isn't her fault, but I do get it, and... and I can't be there for him, And that's that's really hard. But you're seeing Mark. But I'm seeing Mark. So then a couple days ago, we're at the grocery store, Gary and I, and the next thing I know, I'm flat on my back in the frozen foods section. - She fainted. - And I've never fainted. I never seen anybody faint. I don't believe in fainting. Did you hit your head? I would've if this one hadn't caught me. Mrs. Clark is anemic and guaiac positive, so there's definitely some internal bleeding, - which looks like it's coming from a-- - friable tumor near the ampulla of vater. Yes, thank you for that, Dr. Kepner. Dr. Swender told us the biopsy showed the cancer was back. But she said you might be able to take it out. There's a chance I won't be able to go in as deeply as I'll need to, But I promise to do everything I can. Anything you can do. We appreciate it, Dr. Webber. Thank you. Thank you. I honestly don't think I need surgery. - You do. - You do. - It doesn't even hurt that bad. - You have an umbilical hernia. You need surgery. So shut up and fill out the paperwork. I think surgery's just gonna make it hurt worse. You remember when Dad had his Gall bladder out? - Stop talking and write. - Write what? I don't have insurance. Okay? What am I supposed to write? Ask Bailey to do it pro bono. - I can't ask her to do that. - Alex, he's your brother. - Evilspawn has a brother? - Ah. Aaron, Cristina Yang. It's nice to meet you, Dr. Yang. I'm Aaron Karev. Oh, my god. You're so nice He's so ni-- - Be nice. - Why can't you be nice like your brother--angelspawn? - Why can't you? - Fair enough. - Uh, Mer, what's up? You called? - Ten times. Oh, well... Owen's still in his dark place, and he's still not talking, so I turned off my cell in case he would say something, which he didn't. - I hate men. They're stupid. Derek asked me to have a baby with him this morning. Really stupid. Oh!  Great. The pit, with Owen and his dark place. - What have we got? - Cop with multiple GSW's. - How many cops did you say? - Just one. Officer Gina Thompson, 34, GSW's to the hip and chest. Vitals--100 over 70, pulse 118, respiration's 28. That's quite a police escort there, Officer Thompson - I told those guys I was gonna be fine. - Well, yeah.  I wonder why they didn't believe you. - I been in worse shape. - Seriously? Oh, yeah. You should see the other guys. You took down three guys by yourself? Hey, a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. Am I right, girls? - How many bullet wounds? - Four, but I'm wondering if-- no exit wound for the right leg. - Probably busted the femur. - I have to get in there and debride. And trajectory seems-- Seems to have gone upwards. - Breath sounds are-- All right, three chest wounds can't be transthoracic-- Oh, god, Gina, baby. Baby, look at you. I'm okay, baby.  THey're taking really good care of me. This is my husband, Jimmy. That's Lieutenant Moore. - So what'd you find out at the scene? - You were told to wait for backup. Well, I was first on the scene. I heard a shot.  I went in. You disobeyed a direct order. You endangered your own life and everybody in the building. I took down three men by myself. And you got yourself suspended for it. What? it's going to the review board this afternoon. You'll be lucky to have a job by the end of the day. - No, I gotta get outta here. I gotta go defend myself. - I need you to take a deep breath. Breath sounds are decreasing. She's bleeding into her chest. - All right, throw in the chest tube now! - Get them outta here now! - No, I gotta go.  Please! - All right, Gina, just lie back.  Take a deep breath. All you have to do is breathe. Dr. Webber, did you consider doing a whipple On Mrs. Clark? I did, but since the cancer came back, I think I can do a local resection and get the entire visible tumor. Dr. Kepner, are we boring you? No, sir.  I just--I wasn't expecting Chief Shepherd to be up in the gallery during a general surgery. But I guess that's the chief's job, right-- evaluating, observing? Dr. Kepner you're in my O.R., And the only one observing and evaluating you right now is me. Yes, sir.  I'm sorry sir. With the orange or the red? How's that?  Orange and the red. You think it's gonna work? Dr.  Bailey, you got a second? I do. I have a second. which is why I'm spending it with my child. Here, look. Say "Bye-bye, Dr. Karev." See him?  Bye-Bye.  Say bye. Dr. Bailey... My little brother is here, with what looks like a, uh, umbilical hernia. I didn't know Dr. Karev had a little brother. Did you know Dr. Karev had a little brother? - He has no money.  He doesn't have insurance, so-- - ah, mommy sees where this is going. He--he'd have to have you perform the surgery pro bono. Ah!  Did you hear that funny word? Pro Bono? Mommy's got a mountain of surgeries to schedule. Does she have time to do free surgeries? And I'll schedule your surgeries... For the next... week if you want. You think mommy should fix up Dr. Karev's brother... And make him feel all better? Two weeks. A month. Well, all right. I will meet Dr. Karev's brother in, what, half an hour. Say "Bye-bye, Dr. Karev." Bye-bye. I woulda done it anyway, but he just kept talking, didn't he?  You're so good. - Mr. Clark. - How is she? She did great in there.  She was a total trouper. The surgery went great. We got the tumor--all of it-- with good margins. Oh, thank god.  Ohh. Dr. Grey, thank you.  Thank you so much. My wife keeps telling me... I need to be more manly about this. I mean, after all, she's the one with the cancer. She's afraid I'm the one who won't make it. I think you're doing just fine. You both are. - Would you like to see her? - Can I? She should be waking up any minute. How is it your brother is a surgeon and you waited months to take care of this? I don't know.  Karev's are tough. Oh, I guess five years in foster care will do that to you. - Foster care? - You're all foster children? Well, me and Amber were in and out, but Alex, he had like... 17 different foster homes in 5 years. So Alex was a foster child? Yeah, because my mom was, you know, and it was before they had all the meds that they have today, and she was--I guess she was doing her best. But my dad, he... wasn't a good guy, and he was... you know... whatever. And so Alex, he got shipped around a lot. And... he was a pretty rough kid if you didn't know him, So people didn't like to keep him. Then he ended up in juvie. J-j-juvenile detention? Yeah, 'cause my mom, she-- sometimes she'd forgot to... buy food, so... he was good, though.  People wouldn't have even known he was stealing anything if it hadn't been for the video cameras. - How old was he? - Mm, 11, maybe 12. Hey, what are we doing with 28-07? Dude, are you talking crap in here? - No. - Dude, I work here. So go to work. Uh Check the chest tube in 28-07. - Go. - Shut it, Aaron. - What happened after juvie? - Dr. Bailey, I don't think that Alex-- Mind your business. Aaron, after juvie? You couldn't expect me to just sit there with a 10-71 in progress. I had good, solid information the perps were threatening a 2-1-7. Baby, baby, your doctors are here. Uh, We need to take you to surgery. - Kenny, did you get that?  It was a 10-71. Baby, he got that okay? But you gotta go with them. Wait! Look, this is important, okay? They're gonna need a statement. - Baby, what's what's important, trying to save your job? - Jimmy? listen, every year, you promise me that once you make detective, we're gonna... buy a house, have a kid and settle down. But... Baby, it's been seven years. And everytime you get close to a promotion, you go do something stupid. - Baby-- and now these people are trying to save your life, and you want 'em to wait. I'm not gonna stand here and watch you die. I want a life with you, baby. I want a long... happy, boring life. Tell me everything you did. I was trying to wean her off the ventilator, but then I realized that she wasn't breathing on her own. So I put her back on her previous vent settings. Wh--Dr. Webber, what's happening to her? She may have stroked out. Get a C.T. and get the scans to Shepherd and also run an E.E.G. We need to find out right away if there's any brain activity. if there's not, then we need-- She--she looks great.  Oh, thank god. Dr. Grey told me you got the tumor. Thank you so much, Dr. Webber. Can I wake her? Sweetheart?  Oh. You still sleeping? the doctors said you did great in there. Honey? You awake? Alison? Alison? Oh, the patient's had a massive hemorrhage. Look, you see here?  The left temporal lobe? The hemorrhage, it's-- it looks like it-- wow. That bleed is huge. - What? - You look even prettier in your scrubs. What are you gonna do about your giant stroke? - Nothing. - Nothing? Yeah. Mrs. Clark has a left temporal lobe, that's extended into the ventricular system. There's nothing we can do. Want to get a cup of coffee? Only if you keep telling me how pretty I am? I've got three bowel injuries here. - You got anything, Avery? - I found what did the damage. - You see the bullet? - Lodged near the liver. Teddy, I'm looking at a devastator. What?  What does that mean? It means be careful. They're sharp like shrapnel and they explodes on impact. Can you imagine going to work every day knowing you're gonna end up on the wrong side of a gun? I know. She is awesome. And now her husband wants her to give it all up? He's all like, "Let's start popping out babies or I'm leaving you"? Why does it have to be one or the other? Because you don't have kids if you're facing mortar fire every day. It screws with your head. Is that why you don't have 'em--Iraq? Well, first it was residency, and then it was Iraq, and now it's, I don't know, waiting for the right guy? - You want to have kids? - Wait. you don't? Have you met me?  No. Okay, we're done here. - I think I feel it. - Feel what? The bullet. It's right next to the heart. There's still some bleeding.  Don't worry. I got it. No, no, no, don't!  Don't touch it! - Oh, god!  What--what happened? What just happened? - Damn it, Cristina. What happened ? You essentially fired a bullet into that patient's chest is what you did. - That's my intestine? - Yeah, and that part right there is supposed to be on the inside of the membrane, not the outside. Dude, that is sick. Can I get a copy of one of these? I want to hang it from my fridge. Uh, hey, are we doing consults at the desk nowadays? 'cause I kinda need to use the computer. Oh, this is Alex's brother. Aaron, this is Arizona Robbins. Oh, nice to meet you. How come I didn't see you at the wedding? - Actually, Dr. Robbins-- - oh, that's right, that's right. No one's family came. - Last-minute switcheroo and all that. - What wedding? - Uh, Alex and Izzie's - No one's. Alex got married? I'm just gonna go use the computer over there. Bye. He got married and he didn't even call us? No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing, - you know, because of the cancer. - Alex has cancer? - Lexie--. No, Izzie has cancer. - Who's Izzie? Alex's wife. But... She's not really his wife anymore. - It's--you know, I-I really, I wouldn't worry about it. - They got divorced? No, but they a-- well, s-she left.  And then, you know, she came back. But he didn't really think it was the right thing--okay. Lexie! Stop talking. - You guys all right up there? - There is shrapnel everywhere. I was going for the bleeder. I didn't even touch the bullet. I swear. I don't know what happened. When your commanding officer tells you to stand down, you stand down. Give me that. I'm not in the army. And you're not my commanding officer. Dr. Altman and I are your attending. And you are our subordinate. You do exactly as we say even if you do not agree. Do you know why? Because we know more than you do. For example, we know that devastator bullets have chemicals in them, And sometimes they do not detonate on impact. Sometimes the heat from that bovie is enough to make them explode. Do you understand?  Dr. Yang, do you understand? For whatever it's worth, Dr. Hunt, I would've done the same thing Yang did. Anybody would.  If it's a bleeder-- The damage is already done.  There's no point in arguing about it. Let's just fix it. Yang, I need your hands right now, right here. - Okay, you see this?  Hold it. - Yeah, Mm-hmm. Dude, how could you not have told me you got married? - You told him? - No. No. It--it wasn't me.  W-well, some of it was, but-- it was Arizona Robbins, and it was an accident. Yeah, she figured out your own brother would already know - that you married somebody, but hey-- - see, this is why I didn't want to tell you, - because I knew you'd make a big deal out of it. - It is a big deal. You get married on the spur of the moment, - you walk out on your wife-- - I did not walk out on my wife. She walked out on me. You have any idea what mom's gonna do when she finds out? She's gonna go off her meds. She's not gonna do anything because you're not gonna tell her, all right? You're gonna get your free surgery, you're gonna get back in your truck, and you're gonna get the hell outta here. Fine, you know what? I don't need your free surgery. - I'll see ya. - Aaron, stop. - You're not going anywhere. - I don't need your crap! You walk out on us, you walk out on your wife? - Like father, like son. - Take that back. Alex! - Get off me, man. - Take it back! - Alex! What are you two fools-- Oh, no, this is not hap--Alex!  Get off! Karev!  What the hell is your problem, man?! - You are! - Hey, hey, hey! - You hitting people now, too?  You really did turn into Dad. Walk away. Alex, walk away.  Just walk away. - Um, give him some space okay?  Don't follow him. - Okay. - Hey, uh, I need a gurney.  Run, honey. - Right away. She could wake up, right? I mean, people wake up from comas all the time. I'm sorry. Your wife's coma is irreversible. Dr. Grey, would you explain it, please? Mrs. Clark's scans showed a a massive hemorrhage in her brain. But that means there's hope, right? ... Because at least there's activity. And her heart is still beating. Only because the mechanical ventilator is breathing for her. When we turn the machine off, the heart won't get the oxygen it needs, - and it will stop. - Why would you turn it off? People can live for years on these machines. Mr. Clark, the advanced directive your wife signed specifically requested no mechanical ventilation. She filled that form out three years ago when the cancer was first diagnosed. The doctor told her she had six months to live. And she held on for another three years. She'll come back from this, too.  You'll see. You can't unplug her. Legally, we don't have a choice, sir. But... she's my wife. It's my choice. It's your wife's choice... and she made it three years ago. You said the surgery went fine. - That's what you said. - It did. But-- No, no, you're not a doctor. You're a child! And you're useless! I'm done talking with you. I'm done talking with all of you. Who's in charge here? He protected me my whole life, you know? Kicked my dad's ass so hard, that son of a bitch never came back. I always thought he did that for me. But maybe he just likes throwing punches. Aaron, I like you. I do, but you can't talk about my friend that way.  Okay? I need you to count backwards from ten for me, okay? Okay. Ten. Nine. Eight. That's it. A junkie dad, a crackpot mom, and somehow Karev still became a doctor. I'm not easily impressed, but I'm impressed. - Uh, prep him.  We'll go scrub. - Yes, doctor. Dr. Grey. We're meeting Gary Clark in Shepherd's office. Five minutes. I told a patient's husband that... she was fine, That the surgery went perfectly. And the next thing we know, she has a stroke, and we are supposed to just unplug her. And I know--I know that I am supposed to toughen up. I know that I am supposed to not care, but how... h-how do you not care? It's the hardest part of the job...  The very hardest part. How did you do it? How did you learn? I'm still learning. Why is her BP still low? - Is she still bleeding up there? - No, I got it under control. We've had I.R. and blood hanging since we got here. but we can't seem to catch up.  Is her liver still bleeding? - No, I think we got it. - No, Dr. Hunt. Dr. Torres is right. There's still bleeding in the retroperitoneum. - We need a retractor in here. - That's a lot of blood. Avery, get in there, suction. - Can you see where it's coming from? - I can't see past the clots.  Avery? - The suction's clogging now. - Let's use our hands and scoop.  Come on. Let's get in there. Did you check the uterine artery?  That could be the source. Down to 64 over 32. We gotta stop this thing or we're gonna lose her. If we hadn't been distracted by artillery in the O.R., we might have found this bleed earlier. Hunt, not now. That was, um... that was our fault in there.  We were speaking in shorthand. We forget sometimes that you guys are civilians and that you don't know about ballistics. No, it's not just that. It was... It's not the first time. He's been... it's been... he has been through so much. It's not like he talks about it. He can't I mean, I can't talk about it either most days. But... Owen had it worse than me. He has it worse. He's triggered. Right now, he's triggered, and his triggers might never go away. I mean, they'll get better over time, if you give him time, which you should, because he is in love with you. - He just needs time. - He needs therapy. I-I keep telling him to go to Dr. Wyatt-- no, don't--don't--don't do that. He won't go if you tell him to. He's... he's very... he's a guy that way, a man. Don't ever tell him what to do. Just... just tell him how you feel. When's the best time to have kids? The best time to have kids... is never. Well, you asked. Well, yeah, but-- They cry all the time, nonstop. They never sleep. They're terrible conversationalists. And they take everything you've got-- all your time, all your focus, all your patience, all your sleep, Everything--till you've got nothing left for you. But this morning, little Tuck woke me up by... putting his nose up against mine-- his cold, little nose. And he goes "wake up". And he got the "K" sound in "Wake." "Wake up." See, up until today, he'd say "D" instead of "K." "Wade up." Ha! Girl, him nailing that "K" sound... It's the pride I felt, the irrational unbridled, joy... well, it's at least as good as any whipple. Look, if you're waiting for the perfect time to have kids, you're never going to have kids. Hey. Aaron's surgery went well. His hernia defect was fairly large, But Bailey was able to use mesh to bridge it. So... He'll be waking up in a few minutes if you want to stop by. Mr. Clark, I'm deeply sorry for your-- for your loss. No, don't--don't speak about my wife as if she's dead. She's still here.  She could wake up. She's not gonna wake up, Mr. Clark. Not with the brain damage she suffered. - You don't know that. - Mr. Clark, if we don't obey your wife's directive, if we ignore her wishes... She signed that form three years ago-- Her health will deteriorate. She'll lose body mass. She'll have no immune system. She'll require around-the-clock care, And that can become very expensive very quickly. I do not care about that. It'll be no life for either of you. And that's why your wife signed the advanced directive. She didn't want to have live her life this way. And she didn't want you to live your life this way either. Don't you speak for my wife. Don't you dare speak for my wife. I'm sorry, Mr. Clark, but the ethics committee has reviewed your case We are bound by law to obey her wishes. If you unplug my wife... you'll be killing her. I'm sorry. You should, uh... take all the time you need to call your family... to say good-bye. There's no one to call. We didn't have any family. It was just us. We didn't have any kids. It's just me. He's my sister's husband. Excuse me. - Don't play stupid. I'm not playing stupid. I am stupid. I'm stupid and I'm humiliated and... I'm sorry. I just... I've never felt anything... I've never felt like this before. So I-if you could just please forget what you saw, because I promise, you will never see it again, and--and we--we can just go back to being doctors. Please. - This day sucks.  I hate this day. - Oh, god. You don't have to be here. You can go. I'm just making sure you don't croak, And then I'm outta here. You... saved my ass every day when we were kids. You... you were a better parent than mom and dad put together. And every day, I feel bad for Amber, What happened to you, man? I send you money every month. I send mom her meds. You want that to stop? I am this close to being a real surgeon. I can't I-I can't be in that and do this. I can't Amber's a good kid. She turned out okay. You'd like her. You turned out okay, too, Aaron. I'm sorry your wife left you... or got cancer or whatever. Thanks. We repaired the damage to your liver and intestine, cleaned out your fractured hip and fixed your lungs. There was a bullet, and some shrapnel near your heart. - Oh my God. - But Dr. Altman was able to repair all the damage. Thank you. Thank you all so much. Honestly, I-I don't even know what to say. There--there was, uh, there were complications, Gina. There was a lot of bleeding in the abdomen. The uterine artery was involved. We were able to stop the bleed, but... In order to do that, we had to... remove your uterus. What? We had to perform a hysterectomy. Sorry. She--she can't... we can't have kids? I'm so sorry. We can never have kids? - Oh, god Baby, it's okay.  It's all right, baby.  Shh. It's okay, baby. Baby, it's okay. It's okay.  Baby, it's okay. How long has he been there? - About 3 hours. - It's time. See it through. - Mr. Clark. - No, please. I'm Sorry. I keep telling myself, that there is a chance she'll wake up. once you turn off the respirator. There is a chance... Even... even if it's just less than a 1% chance... that she'll start breathing again, right? Miracles do happen. That's what-that's what she always says. Please. Please, Darling... Wake up. - P-please. - I'm so sorry. Please ... Please wake up ... Please ... Please wake up, wake up. Please wake up. - Hey - Were you checking up on me in that surgery today? No, I wasn't checking up on you.  I was observing. You know that's the closest I get to an O.R. these days? I'm gonna choose to believe you on that. They were married 32 years. There was nothing you could've done. I'm going home to my wife. You should do the same thing. Looking good, Gina. You're gonna be back on the beat in no time. What's what they call it, right, the beat? Yes, they do, and no, she won't. Jimmy and I talked about it.  I'm quitting. - What? - Why? Well, 'cause Jimmy' right. I mean, It's a job, you know? And I love it. But I love my husband, too. And what, We're gonna adopt ten Haitian orphans or something? Eight. - Well, congratulations. - Thank you. Gina, I want you to know, I did the best I could with the review board. - Josh, it's okay-- - And they want you back on the job. Are you kidding me? Welcome back, Officer Thompson. - Oh my god! - Hey, look out now.  Watch out. Thank you so much! - Where's Aaron? - He went back to Iowa. You let him drive after surgery? I am not his dad. He's got my number. You know you're nothing like your father, right? You're nothing like your mother. You're good. So you'd be good ... You'd be a good mom. It's the most important job in the world.
