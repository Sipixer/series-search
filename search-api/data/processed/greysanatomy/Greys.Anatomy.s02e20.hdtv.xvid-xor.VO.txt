Derek found us in bed together. How come you can forgive her but not me? I didn't forgive her. Denny, this is dr. Stevens. She'll be tending to you prior to surgery. That guy alex, you with him? No. Good. Means i don't have to fight him for you. Where is my husband? Got into a car accident trying to get to the hospitalbefore the birth. This is our son. He's beautiful. He broke up with me for this girl who doesn't even know he's alive. Listen to me, george, you, meredith grey... never gonna happen. You look sad. I just saw my father for the first time in 20 years. Is there anything that you need? I don't need anything from you. you could just try telling her how you feel. I will never stop loving you. Okay, so, sometimes, even the best of us make rash decisions... bad decisions, decisions we pretty much know we're going to regret the moment... the minute... especially the morning after. I mean, maybe not "regret" regret because at least, you know, we put ourselves out there. But still... Something inside us decides to do a crazy thing, a thing we know will probably turn around and bite us in the ass... Yet we do it anyway. Oh, i'm coming. I'm coming, doc. Just hang on. Just hold it until i get there, please. I'll walk him. No, it's my turn. No, that's okay. I'll go walk doc. You just sleep. It'll be good... the fresh outdoors, spring morning. You just sleep. Okay. Unless you want to talk. Oh, god. Here it comes. I'm not saying that we have to talk. I'm just saying if you <i>want</i> to talk, we could. You know, i can start, you know? And... and then you can talk about anything... at all you want to talk about. It's just too early for me to interpret "girl flip out" into normal conversation. It's just that usually... you start yelling, you know, when you get mad. Then mark showed up yesterday and you haven't yelled yet. I'm trying to give you a chance. So just go, yell. I don't want to yell. You don't want to yell? You? I just want to sleep. And doc, he wants to pee, preferably not inside this trailer. okay. you could yell if you want to. Addison... i can take it.I'm ready. All right, i'm going. Come on. Come on. What i'm saying is... we reap what we sow. What comes around goes around. Morning. Morning. What? So i slept with him again. So i'm a big whore... a big, horny whore who can't get enough. Can we get over the shocked silence already? It's karma, and anyway you slice it... what's going on? Karma sucks. 50 bucks says o'malley caught her doing mark sloan. There's something going on. I mean, look at them. All right, he walked in on her doing mcdreamy. Did i just call that dude "mcdreamy"? Oh, you know you did. Awesome. You are ruining my life. Get a room. Guys... excuse me. Oh, sorry. What's, uh, what's going on? Nothing. Oh, you know we're gonna find out anyway. If you tell us, maybe we can help. There's nothing to tell. Oh, that means there's something to tell. Come on. There's nothing to tell. Well, how about gardenias? Like masses and mountains of gardenias. Are we worried about bees? Okay, that's why i love him. No gardenias. Who would like to present? Keith paulus, admitted last night with chest pains. Status post acute m.i. No family or personal history of heart disease, no cardiac risk factors. He's healthy as a horse. A horse who's in bed after just having a heart attack. See, any minute, i think you're gonna tell us that this was a false alarm and it just seemed that he had a heart attack. She talks when she gets nervous. I understand. Mr. Paulus, unfortunately, the scan shows what looks like a mass around your heart, a very, very large mass. Mass. Okay. Is that code for tumor? Okay, that's absurd. He doesn't have a tumor. He's incredibly healthy. We won't know without further exploration, which is why i'd like to do an angiogram today. Okay, good. Did meredith say anything to anyone about anything? No. Are you gonna dish? No. No. Then leave me alone. I'm working. Well, good. Because i don't want to talk about it, ever. Fine, then don't. I'm just sayin'... are you... that's weird. Do you need to throw up again? No. Because there is no shame i needing to throw up. dad, i don't need to throw up. Shawn begleiter, 11 years old, in for intractable vomiting after a minor head injury. Oh, i wouldn't exactly say "minor." He was hit in the head with a baseball. Yeah, playing first, and this little dolt harry doelhammer hit this line drive out of nowhere when shawn wasn't looking. You know what? This is my fault. I knew i shouldn't have let him play little league. It is clearly a dangerous sport. Rick, let's let the doctor's talk. They want to know what happened, michael. I'm telling them what happened. Shawn's gonna be okay. Right? Yeah, we have to keep a close eye on him. Any recommendations? Traumatic brain injury could indicate anything from a concussion to intercranial hemorrhaging. I'd start with an h&p, do a thorough neuro exam and get a c.t. Good. Are you sure you don't nee to throw up? Dad... tucker. Dr. Shepherd. How, um... how are you feeling? I'm feelin' great. I get to go home. That's fantastic. Is miranda gonna meet you there? No, i'm driving him there. Oh, thank god. Ahem. You okay? I need a consult. I'm not working. Ahem. Miranda... i need a consult. Oh, no. Oh, please don't say that. Addison, i'm so, so sorry. You have poison oak where nobody wants to have poison oak. Like i was saying... oh, god. Payback's a bitch. It's official, my friend. You get to go home. I can't thank you enough. I thank you, my wife thanks you my son thanks you. Hey, where is your wife? You can't drive for another six weeks. Dr. Shepherd's a stickler when it comes to his patients' recovery. I should know. Hey, richard. I wanted to stop in before bailey took you home. Well, she's here somewhere. Uh, your wife came in earlier, said she needed a consult. Consult? Well, bailey's on maternity leave. Seemed like some kind of personal consult. It's okay. I don't mind waiting. All right, i'm back. You didn't make up a chart did you? Please tell me you did not make up a chart. I did not make up a chart, which means we are officially stealing this calamine lotion and these gloves. You take it up with the chief. The chief? No, no. I cannot take this up with the chief. I'm just kidding. Okay, did i make jokes with you when you were in the stirrups? No, you did not, and i'm apologizing. Oh, my. What? These blisters are growing awfully fast. I gotta give you a shot of steroids. Steroids? I have never seen a case of poison oak this bad. Oh! Ew! Girl, what did you... oh, for the love of god, miranda, the calamine! Oh, right, sorry. Oh. What happened with you and o'malley? Nothing. Well, whatever it is, i've done worse. How do you know i did something? How do you know george didn't do something? Because bambi looks pissed and you look guilty. Here we are. Come on, buddy. Let me help you up here. There you go. Fine. I did something... a terrible, terrible something. One time, i put a raw egg in my sock drawer for a month, and then i smashed it in my teacher's grade book. My dads were really mad. Well, what i did was worse than that. Cool. Stop pouting. I'm not pouting. Oh, please. I don't even have to look at you. I can feel you pouting. Whatever meredith did, it wasn't on purpose so get over it already. I'm not being inappropriate. He's acting like she skinned his puppy. yang, that's not nice. Well, i'm not a nice person. If you knew what she did, you would understand. No, i don't understand. I don't want to know. What i want is to analyze this angiogram, book this sucker into surgery and excise his cardiothoracic mass. That doesn't look like a mass to me. That's because it's not. What we thought was a mass is actually a coronary artery aneurysm with a fistula into one of your heart chambers. Is it, uh, easy to fix? Before you answer that question, i just wanted to let you know that we're getting married. We're... we're in love and we're getting married, and we're not so young, so we've been waiting a long time for this. I have my dress and everyone's coming and it's supposed to be the happiest day of our lives, and now the only reason that i'm telling you this is because you have this look on your face... this dark, ominous look... and we're silver lining kind of people. oh, honey. So i just thought it might help if you knew that. dr. Yang, would you close the door? Ahem. We can, uh, we can operate on the aneurysm, try to repair it. But this type of lesion is extremely delicate. The chances of it rupturing in surgery are high. What keeps it from rupturing if i'm just walking down the street? Nothing. The risks are high either way. This isn't happening. This... this can't be happening. It's okay, amy. No, it's not. I know it's a lot to process, but if we're going to operate, we need to do it as soon as possible. We're getting married. Honey. We're getting... we're getting married. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. They seem like a really nice couple. They do. They don't seem like they deserve this. They never do. Really? I guess i'm... i just think... i believe in karma. You know, good people deserve good things. At least, i always thought that that's the way the universe worked. How can you think that and practice medicine? Why? I'm not saying that everybody who gets sick or everybody who dies is bad. I'm just... i'm just sayin' that i think that there's a balance. Or that there should be a bal... i just... there should be some sort of balance. That's... good god, o'malley. What the hell did grey do to you? What exactly do you mean when you say blood in the ventricle? Oh, my god, h-his brain is bleeding? well, there's no need to panic. It's a small amount of blood. And these injuries often resolve themselves. Yeah, but what if it doesn't? Will he lose i.q. Points? Because he is very smart, and that'important to him. He likes to be smart. Do you think we should sue that little brute that hit the ball? Or the coach... should we sue the coach? Shawn loves the coach. Shawn's brain is bleeding. Rick... dad, i'm fine. Jeez. Yeah, he's awake, alert, minimal pain. These are all good signs. I just want to monitor him over the next 48 hours. Okay. Good. You hear that, shawn? Good signs. That means, honey, you shouldn't be scared. I'm not. I am. We know. We know. Oh, they paged you, too? Must be something big. Nobody paged me. They didn't? Can you tie this? Nobody paged you either. Yes, they did. I just got a page. Did you page me? Alex... oh! You free tonight? I might be. Hey, are you still working with meredith? I'm trying to kiss you. Yeah, but did she mention anything about what happened between her and george because i'm starting to get really worried about... 35 year old male, shortness of breath, had a syncopal episode. Pulse is rapid and irregular. Oh, my god. It's denny. What? It's denny. what did he get in the field? Hey, this is my patient until i sign him over ot you. I know this guy. He's on the top of the donor list for a new heart. That makes him surgical. I've already paged dr. Burke and he's on his way, so you better start signing now. What did he get in the field? We gave him 40 of furosemide. Rhythm didn't change after 6 of adenosine. What do we got? It's denny. Denny? Transplant candidate. Acute dysrhytmia and c.h.f. Vitals all over the place. His heart rhythm is a mess. He's in heart failure. Bisoprolol can reduce the chance of mortality. Can we try that? What about ace inhibitors? And digoxin... somebody load him with dig. Stevens, slow down. He's holding on. Barely, but he's holding on. Isn't there mething more we can do? There has to be something more we can do. The best we can do And wait and see if his heart will stabilize. Izzie, we should... we should go. No, you go. I'm... i'm gonna stay. No. L... yes, yes. I see you. No, you don't. Your husband was discharged over an hour ago. I'm not here. Go home. You're not working today. You're on maternity leave. Exactly. Have you made your decision? Wh... oh. Uh, about the surgery. no, we're still, uh, we're still talking about it. Uh, we were thinking maybe we should wait until after the wedding. Um... so... so how is he? Uh, he's pretty much the same. Well, that's good, right? Uh, no. Not really. It... see, with your condition, you're gonna be okay until you're not. And if you opt against the surgery and if you leave now, it's just a matter of time. You might make it to your wedding, but you might not, and you won't know. You're just gonna be okay until you die. you're trying to comfort me? No. I'm trying to convince you to let dr. Burke operate. So that he can die today? He might die today anyway, but dr. Burke is the very best, and he's your very best chance. Stevens, everything all right? Oh, it's just... it's just not fair. You know, it's really not fair. We treat... jerks all the time. Patch 'em up, send 'em off, whether they deserve it or not. No big deal. But... denny... he's a good guy, dr. Burke. He's a... really good guy with a bad heart and all we can do for him is wait. Well, believe me. I know. I've been treating denny a long time. He doesn't deserve this. No, what he deserves is the best cardiac care, and we're giving him that. You really like him, don't you? He just... he just... doesn't deserve this. Okay. Aah. All right, how's that? Is that ice pack helping? I don't know. I don't think so. Mind if i ask how exactly this happened? I slept with mark! Oh! And he had poison oak on... no! I slept with mark a year ago, and apparently, this is what i get. Yeah. But how did you... i live in a trailer. I have meredith grey's dog. And i went outside to throw a stick, and i had to pee, so i squatted. Because i didn't want to go inside and wake up my husband because of the way he's been looking at me since yesterday. Just wanted a few minutes of peace, and this is what i get. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, don't cry. This is what i get! Don't cry. Please don't cry. Please don't cry. Stop. You're gonna make me... Oh, lactate. Can you give some gauze? I'm sorry. Oh, mirand i'm sorry. Quick, give me some gauze. I'm sorry. Stop. Shh. Can i help you, chief? Dr. Bailey... i don't know what you're doin' in there, but whatever it is... oh. Oh. Oh, no. Dr. Bailey, uh, i'm... sorry. Uh... carry on. Okay, fill me in. I was doing his routine neuro check. I noticed he was altered. Most likely a clot. Acute hydrocephalus. Oh, damn. We need to remove the pressure right now. Cranial access kit's ready. "Cranial access"? Access to shawn's brain? Debbie, get them out of here. Gentlemen. Rick. We're not going anywhere. Look, i am about to drill a hole into your son's skull. You don't want to watch this. He's our son. We're not leaving. Rick... we are not leaving his side. 15 blade, please. I want the theter ready to drain as soon as i penetrate the dura. Do not panic. The drill. catheter, quickly. pupils reactive. Pressure's stabilizing. Is he okay? I want neuro checks every hour And increase the supervision. We're in the clear for now. We're in the clear? You guys did well. Oh, i have a headache. Welcome back, little man. "9-1-1." Dad, you look white. Are you okay? Oh, great. Yes. You got here quick. We gotta get his heart rate under control. Push 300 of amiodarone, now. Status? Atrial fibrillatn. His heart's beating too fast. If we can't get it to slow down, then... it'll give out. All right, let's try synchronized cardioversion. Push 5 of morphine. Izzie. You're awake. Hey. I was hoping i might get to see you. You've been working us pretty hard around here. The things i have to do to get a girl's attention. Denny, we're about to send a series of electric currents through your body. Hopefully the shocks will be enough to slow your heart rate back to normal. I'll be here at whole time This gonna hurt? it won't be fun. I guess maybe you oughta hold my hand then, huh? You mind if i handle the paddles? Be my guest. Ready? Yeah, hit me. Clear. No change. Try it at 100. Clear. holy smoke. Denny, you are a lucky man. Oh. Oh, doc, i oughta kick your ass for making me yell like a baby in front of the girl i'm tryin' to impress, man. Oh, jeez. oh. Take care, man. Dr. Bailey. Dr. Bailey! Didn't you hear me? Uh, i'm a little distracted right now. Oh, yes. I've been paging you. I'm not on call. I'm on maternity leave. I've been paging my wife as well, but she hasn't been answering either. You know where she is. Just because i know doesn't mean you should. Some things you just don't get to know, not from me. And, really, you don't wanna know. You have to tell me where she is. I saved your husband's life. She saved my baby. So baby trumps husband? Mm. Baby trumps husband? Hey, amy. The web site said that you should save your receipts. I'm sorry? Well, just in case something happens, you know, to have them. I have all of ours right here. I've got, you know, i've got my dress and the band, and i've got the ballroom deposit and the honeymoon. You know, my mom said i shouldn't, you know, keep them. Said it was bad luck. It was... it was... it was tempting fate. This isn't your fault. Y-you have a life. You... you fall in love, you make plans, you have fantasies... and none of them involve all of them ending in a blink of the eye. What are you doing? Hiding. All right, so you slept with o'malley. Get over it already. He told you? Uh... no. I was just kidding. Uh, i mean, it's not like i should be surprised. Why not? Because when your life is sucking, you get drunk and sleep with inappropriate men. It's your thing. Whatever. I find it charming. You sleep with inappropriate women when you're sober. One inappropriate woman, and izzie forgave me for that. O'malley... he's not gonna get over this. Ize hasn't forgiven you. Yes, she has. We're together. No, you're not. Izzie may be sleeping with you, but she'll never see you the way she saw you before you slept with olivia. Why are you trying to piss me off? You're trying to suggest that it's forgivable for you to sleep with olivia but not forgivable for me to sleep with george. You told him? I ca... george. Wow, when i'm wrong about someone... no, l... i am <i>really</i> wrong. No, george! It's not... it's not what you think. Dude, chill. You chill! You chill! I'm not... i'm not gonna chill. George, l... what's going on? Fetus is freaking out. I can see that. Why are you freaking out? You think that someone is... your friend, you know. At theery least, that she'd respect your privacy. What's going on? Baby boy is freaking out. She can see that. I can see that. Why is he freaking out? George, can we at least talk? I don't want to talk! Not to you! I wanted to keep my mouth shut, and if you hadn't been running away from me every time you see me, you would know that. Okay, you're right. But can we just talk now? You want to talk now because you told everyone that we had sex! Shh. You had sex? You had sex with george? You didn't tell them? No. Damn it! george! george! go away. he's gonna be okay, right? He dislocated his shoulder. He's gonna be fine. That's not exactly what i meant. Meredith... if you can't make this right, if you can't fix this with george, just so you know, if it comes to choosing sides, i'm on his. he's the weaker kid. I mean, even i don't beat up on weaker kids. It's cheap. I did a terrible thing. I didn't... i did a terrible thing. He's been in love with you since day one. There's no way you didn't know that. We all do terrible things. Thank you. You're welcome. "george o'malley"? Uh, hi. Dr. George o'malley. You're the heart- in-the-elevator guy. Yeah, that me. That was amazing. Uh, thanks. I, uh, dislocated my shoulder. Yeah. Oh! I can see that. It's really not so bad. Yes, it is. Pick your poison. Uh... no painkillers,thanks. Bold choice. No, l... officially, i'm on duty. And planning to stay? Mm-hmm. Bolder choice. all i need is help, uh, popping it back in. You got into a fight? Um, l-i fell down some stairs. Where, at your girlfriend's? What? No, i'm single. Single, huh? Hurts less if you don't see it coming. all set? All set. Okay. Thanks. You're welcome. Bye. don't. Don't? Don't be nice to me. I did a terrible thing. We all do terrible things. No, l-i... i did a thing that i can't even believe i did, and... i was sad and... oh. I'm pretty sure i'm gonna lose all of my friends. You won't lose me. You're not my friend. Yes, i am. Well, l-i could be. I'm a very good friend. No, we can't be friends. We could be friends. You'd be lucky to have me. How? How can we be friends? We could, uh... hang out. Mm-hmm. I walk doc every other morning, tiger mountain trail. We could meet, have coffee, watch doc play and... discuss the complex nature of our existence. Right. We could. Might be fun. I could be your friend, meredith. No. We can't be friends. I'm just adding nitro. Your blood pressure's stable now, your c.h.f. Has improved and the atrial fibrillation resolved. I like the way you say "fibrillation." Fibrillation. Tease. How are you feeling? You, um... do you believe in karma? Um... actually, i do. I think you might be mine. well, you must have been very, very good to deserve me. I must have. okay. i wouldn't do that if i were you. Well, dr. Bailey... if she wants her privacy, then we will give her her privacy, understood? But dr. Bailey paged me. She did? yeah I did. And i'm still not here. I'm still on maternity leave. And i still need some privacy, chief. come In here. no moving, no peeking, no pulling the curtain. Just stand there and let her talk. Do you understand? Is this really necessary? I said, "do you understand?" I'm not mentally challenged. I'm not so sure about that. let her talk. Addison, this is ridiculous. Stay where you are. Promise. Okay, i promise. I'm gonna show you something, and... when i do, you do not get to laugh, and you do not get to gloat. Why would i gloat? I have poison oak. What? hmm. You do, indeed, have poison oak. So are we even yet? I mean, is this bad enough? Haven't i repaid my debt to society, derek? all right, let's take a look. Ahh. Come on, tuck. Let's take your daddy home. She really didn't tell you about it? No. God, is that a bad thing? Well, she tells you everything. So it didn't matter enough to her to even talk about. Okay, george, the pity thing? Not good. If you want crappy things to stop happening to you, then stop accepting crap and demand something more. Hey, amy. Oh, could you tell, uh, dr. Burke that, um, keith is gonna have the surgery? Oh, that's great. Where are you going? Um, i... i'm... i'm... i'm not strong enough for this. Hold it, amy. I know it's hard, but your fianc\ is going into surgery. You're gonna want to be here when he wakes up. No, i won't. Um... he's not my fianc\ anymore. You're leaving him? I'm not strong enough for this. So the "in sickness and in health" part of your vows, you're just planning to leave those out? Please try to understand. I don't like that i'm t strong enough. I just know that i'm not. George, he's crashing. What? his aneurysm may have blown. Page dr. Burke! he's gonna live? Burke's a miracle worker. Did you know this guy's fianc\e left him? Sounds like he dodged a bullet. I don't think he's gonna see it that way. If she can't love him back the way he loves her... then she doesn't deserve him. You heard about me and meredith? Well, everyone heard, george. You were yelling about it in the hallway. It must've sucked. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Um, if... if i made you feel anythingike i'm feeling right now... i'm sorry. that's nice to hear. how was that? It was good. Really good. 'cause i... i could do it again. I like to do it. Yeah. I could do it until you... i'm fine. Yeah? Ow. Oh, i'm sorry. Okay. You're on my hair. Yeah. Okay. Meredith. Oh, george. Meredith. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. Nothing's wrong. Why would you think anything's wrong? You're crying. Oh, it'll stop. Just ignore me. No, i can't... i can't ignore you. Yeah. It's... it's fine. It's fine. Just... it's okay. Just... you're almost done, right? no. George. Meredith. Meredith... George, please. sleeping with me, is it really this awful for you? No, george, it's not that. It's not you. George... there's a suitcase in the hall. I was just getting my shirt. There's a suitcase... yeah, uh, i don't live here anymore. Excuse me. Why? I just want to know why you... if you didn't want to... i didn't know i didn't want to. You were there, and you were saying all these perfect things, and i was sad. And so i thought, maybe. Maybe i've just been overlooking what's been in front of me. and if i just give it a chance because you're george and you're so great... i didn't know i didn't want to until i knew i didn't want to. Yeah. Okay. Can we please just go back to everything the way it was? I don't know how to go back. No. I'm done. We're done. one way or another, our karma... Will leave us to face ourselves. We can look our karma in the eye or we can wait for it to sneak up on us from behind. You ready? What? Aren't we, uh... i thought we had plans for tonight. Oh... i forgot. I'm sorry. Rain check? Sure. amy? She's not, um... here. Um... but you are. That's what's important. She left? She really left? Who does that? What kind of person does that? One way or another, our karma will always find us. Hey. Hey, yourself. Wow. i gotta say, not exactly how i envisioned our perfect first date. Are you kidding? Do you know how hard i've had to work to get a cute boy in bed before? You think i'm cute. okay. Shut up and drink your juice. And the truth is, as surgeons... we have more chances than most to set the balance in our favor. George. Dr. Torres. Callie. you going a trip? Uh, sorta. Well, in that case... give me a call when you get back in town. no matter how hard we try... we can't escape our karma. It follows us home. he's your friend, and he needed our help. Are his problems surgical? Mm. No. Then technically, he doesn't need our help. you're a good person. I am not. Good night. Oh, good night. good night. i guess we can't really complain about karma. It's not unfair. It's not unexpected. It just... evens the score. Hey, boy. Good boy. And even when we're about to do something we know will tempt karma to bite us in the ass, well, it goes without saying... so... so...
