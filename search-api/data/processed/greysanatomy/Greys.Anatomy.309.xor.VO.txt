so nothing sexual? mom! no. nothing sexual. where are the other o'malley men today? i told 'em to get back to work. they were climbing the walls in here. well,i'm here to prep you for surgery. as you know,dr. burke is your surgeon. dr. burke--right. georgie's always saying "dr. burke this,dr. burke that." yeah,he's pretty incredible. he's one of the best cardiothoracic guys in the world. yeah. um,i have to go. i'm gonna be right back. you're not even working today. why are you getting paged? i have to go. you're pretty. there's nothing sexual between you and georgie, not even a little bit? louise! what? i just want georgie to be happy. okay. let's just prep you for surgery. anything you would've done different,dr. hahn? given the size of the wound, i would've given up sooner. so how have you been,preston? last time i saw you,you stole my patient's heart. then you got shot. karma rocks. what brings you all the way from seattle presbyterian to seattle grace? a consult, and knowing how much my being here would annoy you. oh,on the contrary,it's always a pleasure, but not as much as when you leave. hey,do you think i could get in on erica hahn's surgery? i've heard she's amazing. who? dr. hahn. she's doing a consult. i wonder who the v.i.p. patient is. um,get him-- get him to c.t wh-- maria,may i have my father's chart? dr. hahn... i was pleasantly surprised to hear you were joining us today. oh,well,i'm always ready to lend a hand,dr. webber. george. hey,how's your dad? uh,here is his chart. he's in room 3975. it's down the hall, third door on the right. i'll be there in a minute. okay. i'll escort you,and you can tell me what it would take to steal you away from seattle presbyterian. we could use an extra hand around here. callie. hey. we broke up. you broke up with me. unless i'm missing something? that doesn't mean... i'm just asking about your dad. why? why do you care? because i care about you. right. well,i guess that's why you slept with mark sloan,huh? that makes sense. did dr. bailey see the chest x-ray? no,but with the decreased breath sounds and the low pulse ox, she suspects janelle will need a chest tube. i'm dabbing out freakin' glass splinters, and she gets to do a chest tube? you signed on for this. this is not a good day for me. this is not a good day for me at all. the baby looks good,janelle. heartbeat's strong. do you want me to call the father? you could do that,but that would require me speaking to him,which i no longer do. plus,hearing he's a daddy from some random doctor might not go over real well. so the baby's father doesn't know. no,and he's never going to. grey,can i speak with you? um,i'm setting up a chest tube. i need to talk to you when you're done. i'll come find you. you know,i can suture. i've done it before. when you can do a z-plasty and barely see the scar, give me a call. till then,dab and clean,dab and clean. how's plastics,karev? everything you've ever dreamed of? uh,we're not doing a chest tube,dr. grey. what's going on? ms. duco,there's a shard of glass going into your heart. hey. hey. have you seen dr. torres? no. quite a morning,huh? 14 injured,2 dead. i know. there's a lot of blood... yeah. and blood. you know,there's a girl who literally has a shard of glass in her chest. come here. larry dickerson-- the guy that crashed into the fish market. it's a subdural hematoma along with air in his mediastinum. now look at this,look at his spine right here. spinal stenosis. yep. narring of the spine,most often a result of aging. causes numbness in the legs and feet. his case is so far advanced, i doubt he could even feel his feet, which means-- oh,he shouldn't have been driving. you paged me? patient has air in the mediastinum. wanted you to take a look. oh,this guy shouldn't have been driving. i know. it looks like he has a tracheal injury. you going into the o.r.for the subdural? yeah,as soon as one becomes available. what's going on with cristina? what do you mean? well,first she kicks me out of bed at 5:00 this morning so she can have girl talk with meredith, and now i can't find her. she was supposed to be my intern. i had to get my own c.t. what's goin' on? nothing. cristina's fine. she's just working really hard. i'm sure i don't have any idea. don't mention cristina to burke,okay? it's just not a good idea. yeah? what did you talk about this morning? bank robberies... which isn't really the point,okay? she was jogging,and well... just cut her some slack today,okay? not that i should interfere-- but you're going to anyway. i'm just gonna ask once,very nicely. please. please. you know what says "thank you" like nothing else? i'm leaving now. hey,uh,derek's looking for you. he said you left a patient in the c.t.-- i'm trying to hear. what's going on? dr. yang. yes,sir. when you see dr. burke, tell him i need to speak with him. of course,sir. uh,is that,uh,dr. hahn from presbyterian talking to george's dad? mr. o'malley has elected to have dr. hahn perform his valve replacement. um,but what about dr. burke? dr. burke's been replaced. well,so what if he replaced me with dr. hahn? i'm no longer on his father's surgery. that's a good thing if it means you stop obsessing. george didn't just replace you. he told the chief. the chief knows. i mean,for all we know, erica hahn's being considered the new head of cardio. and the chief asked me to tell you that he has something important to talk to you about. oh,okay. so we need to align our stories. this is why i feel like i'm covering for you. i don't line up stories. that's not me. oh,i'm sorry. you think it's me? that's not fair. you know,it's done. the chief wants to talk to me,so i will talk to him. i am not telling him a story,cristina. i'm gonna tell him the truth. burke. burke. still getting a heartbeat there? happy to say. and it'll get stronger once you've had your surgery. do you mind me asking why you guys switched from dr. burke to dr. hahn? no,we didn't. georgie did. did he say why? not really,no. did georgie and dr. burke maybe have a falling out? not that i know of. then is there something going on with george and dr. hahn? ah,here we go again. no, there's nothing going on with george and dr. hahn. i already told her. dr. torres is the one who loves george. well,then why did dr. torres break up with him? why did dr. torres break up with him, i mean,between us? well... how much did george tell you? everything,i'm his mother. okay,well,then you know that callie is a little bit out there. i mean,i have seen more of that girl's body than i have of my own. it's just a little bit too much information for me. i mean,nobody needs to be naked that oft. he didn't tell you that? um... i don't know why they broke up. george seemed to really like her, and he kind of needed her. i mean,you remember the whole george and meredith thing. wait,george and meredith? i knew it. george didn't tell you that either. first meredith,then dr. torres and now this dr. hahn... o'malley men are studs. he isn't a stud,he's just very handsome. okay,people,focus. george is not dating erica hahn. then why would he want her to perform his father's surgery instead of dr. burke? is she better than dr. burke? she's good,really good. nobody's better than burke. then why can't i have dr. burke? i don't know. do me a favor... could you find out? hey,have you seen george? no. he is acting so weird. so is cristina. what is wrong with everyone today? hey,callie. i was gonna come and find you. what did you want toalk to me about? panties. uh,callie,what you up to? i'm gonna kick meredith's ass right now. get off me! i kept your secrets,i was discreet, i was a really good friend to you, and i didn't have to be, and then you go and do this? do what?! hey,callie,use your words! use your words,callie. panties,meredith. i'm talkin' about the mcfreakin'-cone-of-silence pair of panties i pulled off the bulletin board, not to mention the adulterous mcsex i witnessed. hey,hey,hey! you remember that? hey,i'm sorry,i'm sorry, but she's very little,and you're hurting her. you told george. my night with mcsteamy was not yours to share. that's what this is about,your sex with mcsteamy? you told izzie. no. no,no! callie! you told me you slept with someone. you never said it was sloan. george told me it was sloan. george? george told you? who told george? maybe perhaps the guy you slept with? um... george thinks i betrayed him, and i didn't. i didn't. we were broken up. well,go tell george. dude,she went all cage fighter on you. i know. how's my dad doing? george,your ex is hard-core-- passionate,but hard-core. yeah,i don't-- how is he doing? he's fine,george. and my mom,is she driving you crazy? has she offered to iron your scrubs? she does that. she offers to iron things, weird things. they're fine. they're just,um... what? confused. you know,suddenly a stranger is operating on your dad's heart, and they both want to know why, and i have no idea what to tell them,so... cristina,tell izzie why dr. hahn is doing my dad's surgery instead of burke. go on. look... dr. hahn is an incredible surgeon. your father is in great hands. nothing else matters. you're wrong. there's a lot of people with fathers in this hospital, and it does matter to them who their doctor is. george,i... i-i know this is scary. i understand that. but burke... i didn't come back until i was ready. preston burke is ready. look,i... i just can't talk to you about this. this is none of your business,and just please, please stay out of this. what do i do about your parents? you don't do anything about my parents. your job is to watch,remember? i was just... sorry. you might consider leaving that alone until she goes into the o.r. yeah,about that-- when's that gonna happen? there's a large shard of glass in my heart,you know? you'd be surised how long people can live with stuff inside their bodies-- glass,shrapnel,bullets. i saw a guy once with half a chair leg in his chest. that was one hell of a splinter. can we focus here? well... it looks like we'll,uh,have the o.r. in a few hours. so if i get hit by a car,thrown through a window, have a big shard of glass in my chest and my baby survives, that's pretty much a sign i should have this baby,right, even without a father? everyone has a father. not if she doesn't tell him. you think i should tell him. everyone saids i am wrong he's scum,eand now i'm the bad guy 'cause i don't want him in my kid's life,right? that's what you're thinking? janelle... my thing is,what about the kid? i mean,what happens when he's 6 or 7 and he wants to meet his dad? karev,this is none of your business, okay? she asked,okay? he cheated on me. makes him an ass. doesn't mean you have to be one. ms. duco? b.p.'s 80 over 60. j.v.d. and muffled heart sounds. she's officially unstable. the o.r. can't wait. alex,find burke and bolus a liter of saline, hang a unit of blood. we've got to get her ready for transport, people,now! i'm sorry. spinal what? stenosis. and he got this in the accident? i think it may have caused the accident. spinal stenosis is common in older people. no,no. larry didn't have anything wrong with him before the accident. so there were no symptoms that either of you noticed? no,larry was fine. we're old,but we've both been in good health. larry was fine. we're gonna need to operate on your husband. he has a subdural hematoma, which is bleeding in the brain. and we need to bng in a cardiothoracic surgeon to repair the hole in his trachea, which is his windpipe. that--that--so that means that you need to operate on his... chest and his head? yes. we just wanted to go to the market. it'll be okay, whatever happens. cristina-- he can't punish you. every surgery we've done has been textbook, and we haven't lost a single patient. we're flawless,and he can't-- cristina. you we right. the chief does want dr. hahn to replace me as head of cardiothoracic surgery. richard's planning to retire. and he's recommending that the board name me... the next chief of surgery. this is good. it's good,right? it means george didn't say anything. i'm going to be chief. and you didn't tell him anything about your tremor,right? i'm going to be chief... of surgery at seattle grace hospital. why do you sound like that? because i'm going to be chief of surgery at seattle grace hospital. this is what you've worked for. this is what you wanted. and i can work harder. i-- i can learn more procedures, i will do whatever you need. what? right now nobody knows. i-i mean,yes,okay, the fact that george hasn't told the chief yet doesn't mean that he won't,but we can deal with that. i mean,i'll--i'll talk to him,or you talk to him. and once you're chief,it won't matter. i mean,you'll be chief. okay,this is--this is good. nobody will ever know. i'll know. i can't be chief,not now,not like this. do you know how long i wanted this? my entire career. and when i finally get it... there's blood on it. i had a tremor,and i didn't say anything about it. it's unimaginable. it's unethical... dishonorable. i've crossed a line. we crossed the line together. i crossed the line with you. you dragged me across the line. you made us a team, you told shepherd i was fine, you said,"nobody has to know." i was out there on my own. you made us a team. i did what you needed me to do. you were standing there looking at me, telling me your whole life was your hands, ifou couldn't operate,if you couldn't be preston burke-- that was your concern,not mine. oh,no,no,no,no. no,you put that on me. when you got shot,i walked away, and you cannot let that go,can you? well,i'm sticking now. okay? i'm sticking. you know how tired i am? do you know how scared i am every time we go into surgery? but i do it,for you. do you know how scared i am when we go into surgery? i don't have to just worry about my career now. i have to put yours on my back,too. we are a team. oh,there is no team. there is no team. there is only me,once again, making allowances for your emotional shortcomings. okay,we shouldn't say anymore. no... we shouldn't. oh,look who's here. oh,look how wrinkled he is. thank god i brought the travel iron. mom. m,what's going on? they paged me to your room. are you okay? fine. it's just that... what? want me to? (mr. o'malley) no,i'll do it. here's the thing, we appreciate everything you've done for us. all the strings you pulled with dr. burke and dr. hahn-- the last thing we want to do is cause trouble 'cause we heard how much stress you been under. first with you and meredith, then with you and callie-- izzie! i thought they knew. and we hope you won't be mad, but we rescheduled the surgery for tomorrow because-- we're sticking with dr. burke. what did you say to them? we asked her-- i asked you to stay outta this. i just told them what i thought, that doc-- get out. w-what? georgie... you don't talk like that to anyone. dad... did dr. stevens tell you that she's on probation because the last time she was allowed to interact with patients,someone died? it was really nice to see both of you. you know the guy who caused the accident? an o.r. just cleared up. you available to scrub in with me? shherd... burke. what's going on? dr. burke,we got a pregnant woman in the pit with a traumatic cardiac tamponade from a piece of glass piercing her heart. addison asked for you. well, you can't do two surgeries at once. no,i can't. well,she's bleeding like crazy. what do you want to do? burke,my guy can't wait much longer. well,dr. hahn is here. invite her to scrub in with you,dr. shepherd. i'll take the glass piercing the heart. okay. uh,karev. yes,sir. make sure that dr. yang scrubs in with me. everybody gets a surgery but me. we were broken up,as in not together. i can't do this now. i-i slept with mark to get over you, and guess what,it didn't work. it was a mistake,but i did not betray you,george. i wouldn't-- i would never do that. i can't do this now. oh,where are you taking her? she's having an operation. oh,no. what--what-- what's wrong with her? she has some bleeding in her chest, and they need to operate. i'm sorry,janelle. i'm so,so sorry. it's okay,mrs. d. i'm gonna be okay. all right. mrs. dickerson,you should go back to your husband's room and wait there,okay? he's having surgery,too. everyone is having surgery. uh,go on and take her up. the surgical team is waiting. ma'am. what did i do? how could i have done this? done what? done what? i knew that he had trouble,my husband,with his feet. my daughter came to town,she took away his keys. she took away his ke. you gave 'em back to him. if i'd sided with my daughter, oh,larry would have felt so betrayed. he loves to drive. he--he--he didn't mean to hurt anyone. oh,god. i didn't mean to hurt anyone. i'm so sorry. um... listen,come with me. what? i know that you didn't mean to hurt anyone... but we need to tell the police. just trust me,okay? it entered the right ventricle and went right through the septum. i'm going to need to place a pericardial patch. shall i do a running whip stitch? no,i've got it. i can do a mcgoon. i've been practicing. dr. yang,move to the other side of the table. dr. burke,i apologize. i-- move... to the other side of the table. thank you.
