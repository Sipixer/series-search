no matter what words you use, it all means the same thing Happy. We're supposed to be happy, grateful for friends,family. Happy to just be alive. Whether we like it or not. What do you think you're doing? Answering the door. You're going to the hospital? Yes,but Meredith, everyone is supposed to be in the kitchen by 9 a.m. To help me make dinner. It'sThanksgiving. I'm really not in the mood. But it's like a family Doorbell. This where Georgie lives? Georgie? O'malley. Where is he,upstairs? Oh,George. O'malley! O'malley! Should I call the police? O'malley! Meredith, I'm serious! You need to be back here for dinner at 6. I mean it! Five,four,three,two Happy Thanksgiving! So, I was thinking that we could have sex tonight. Look,I know we're both gonna feel weird about it, and it's the first time since Mark. And Meredith. I have the day off. Do you have the day off? I have stop by the hospital. I have patients I need to check on. If you have the day off, what are you doing here? I was thinking we could have sex tonight. Come on, I made a reservation at noon. I figure we could do The Thanksgiving thing, you know, and then I don't know,just rip the stitches. Get it over with. No anesthesia. Right. What do you think? Grey we're working with a temp attending today. Dr. Kent he's subbing in from Mercy west. We need to get him oriented. And thank you for volunteering to come in. Saved me from having to choose an intern to torture. Happy to be tortured. Not a fan of Thanksgiving? Not a whole hell of a lot to be thankful for. I like Thanksgiving. A day people spend with their families. Too much family time triggers depression, repressed childhood rage, bitter disputes over the remote and way too much alcohol. People get stupid, people get violent, people get hurt. And that's a good thing because surgeries,Grey. Lots and lots of surgeries. I never thought of that. The stupidity of the human race, Grey be thankful for that. You're supposed to be at home. So are you. Best maze procedure I've ever done. Under an hour. I thought you had the day off. I did. I do. I'm leaving. I simply like to start my day cutting. It gives me a rush. Yeah,admit it. You can't function 10 feet away from the hospital. I notice you're both here. Well,I'm here for an hour. I'm on my way home. Say it like you mean it. I know how to have a life outside this hospital. Damn right,you do. Dr. Kent. Yes. I'm the surgical resident assisting you today. I know you're subbing in from Mercy West, so if there is anything I can do to help you look,I'm here for one day. I don't need my ass kissed. All I need is to tell you what to do and you do it, and I don't like mistakes. I don't make mistakes. Whatever. There's only one resident I want in my o.r. The guy they call the nazi. Do you know him? The, the nazi? He gets great word of mouth, stellar rep balls the size of texas. That big? Sounds like an impressively talented man this nazi. Do you know him or not? Never heard of him. But I'll be sure to keep an eye out. For now you can work on smaller cases. A guy just came in to curtain three. Page me if you get confused. I'll be sure to do that. Like I said, the stupidity of the human race. Hurry up,Georgie. There's a turkey out there with your name on it,huh? Whoa. Hey. Where are you going? Hey! Where are you going? Every year,my father, my brothers and I hunt shoot and kill a helpless, slow-moving turkey. Isn't that great? O'malley! Okay,but what about dinner? we'll have him back as soon as he kills his first bird. This is the year Georgie becomes a man, right,Georgie? Come on. Wait,I can't cook dinner by myself! Who's gonna help me? Who's gonna help me? Holden Mckee brought in from mayfield nursing home. Mayfield? He's in the garden? Garden? Vegetable. Yeah,his chart says he fell into a persistent vegetative state 16 years ago. He was a firefighter injured by falling debris in the line of duty. What brings him here today? Fell from his bed while being turned by the orderlies. Insurance says he has to be checked out. Temporoparietal scalp lac with associated hematoma. What's your plan? Irrigate and explore the wound repair the lac. He'll need a c.t. To rule out intracerebral haemorrhage, contusion or cerebral edema. Go to it. If anybody asks, I'm off looking for the nazi. Okay. It's just me and you. I'd give anything for your kind of serenity. Great. Now I'm jealous of vegetables. You just look so peaceful. Dr. Bailey. This guy's got third-degree burns over half his body. Tried to deep-fry a turkey. Of course, he got drunk first. It's gonna be good. You want in? My p.v.s. Case he opened his eyes, and I think he was looking at me. He wasn't looking at you. No,he was. Anything good? Uh,nothing you want to waste time on. There are 13 patients that need sutures. She's the intern. She can do the sutures. Actually, she's on her way to c.t. With a v.i.p. Patient on orders from the nazi. Tell him I'm looking for him. Okay. The burn unit is waiting for him. I'll meet in the o.r. Grey, get a c.t. Have neuro consult, but trust me he wasn't looking at you. Don't mention Shepherd or Montgomery-Shepherd. Okay. Or the fact that Shepherd is with Montgomery-Shepherd. Okay. Or anything having to do with syphilis. I've been in social situations before. Yeah,well not with me. Well, why are we here? Just be nice or something. It's half past 10. You're late. I've had to try to do all this Hi,Dr. Burke. Hello. What was I supposed to do, blow off my boyfriend for Thanksgiving? I tried to but he wouldn't blow. He's like something sticky that won't blow off. okay,he's gonna ruin Thanksgiving. What am I supposed to talk to Dr. Burke about? People who are shocked when I show up uninvited to their homes call me Preston. Nobody calls you Preston. You don't call me Preston. Nice house. Izzie, why is it so quiet in here? Meredith went to the hospital and George is off shooting things with his family. So it's just me, you and Preston? And Alex, when he shows up. Oh,great. Hey,Alex, it's me. Where are you? Okay,call me back. Is something burning? Oh,god,yes! Hey,chief. I'm on my way home. Yeah,me too. I was supposed to meet Addison 20 minutes ago. Dr. Shepherd, are you leaving? I'm also going home. Then go home. Adele's sister's in town. I hate that woman. The o.r. Board needs to be checked one more time. It does,doesn't it? Excuse me. I didn't think you'd be here today. Yeah,well I need a neuro consult. Holden mckee, p.v.s. 16 years. Well,there's no bleed, there's no mass,no fracture. He, he can be discharged. Well,he opened his eyes when I was examining him. He opened his eyes. Yeah,that's normal. Certain reflexes are preserved. There's arousal but no awareness. But he was looking at me. He wasn't looking at you. He was. This c.t. Report says he wasn't. Do you want to argue with what I know I saw? No,meredith, I don't want to argue with you anymore I gotta go. I'm late. He was looking at you? 65 gto. '57 bel air convertible,2-door. The gt 500, that was a car. Georgie,pick a car. Come on. You do realize that you can buy a turkey at the market? They have hundreds of them, you know,all wrapped and ready to go, no ammo required. You'll be the one to shoot the turkey today. I can feel it. That's the thing, I don't want to shoot a turkey. You say that every year. Well,and every year, I don't shoot the turkey. What is that? It was supposed to be my marinade. Alex,it's me again. Just wondering where you were at. You've never made a Thanksgiving dinner before. You can't cook? Izzie! Well, I'm a baker. I bake. But I've seen my grandmother cook a million times. Okay,that's it. If there's no food, I'm going home. Cristina,Cristina I have this. What are you using as a reference text? "The joy of cooking." I also printed up some recipes from the internet, but they all seem to contradict one another. And I can't figure out which side of the turkey is the top and which is the bottom. Okay. I'm gonna need a basting brush, a bowl,a clove of garlic and do you have any fennel? Um,yeah,right here. Well, let's get this turkey up and running,Stevens. Garlic. Garlic. I'm gonna need liquor lots and lots of liquor. There's no sustained visual pursuit. You know,you might have just seen him respond to some sort of external stimuli. He wasn't looking at you. I'm sorry. I was sure he was. Look. He just did it again. Mr. Mckee Can you follow the light? Can you hold up two fingers? Okay,well,I know you're late for something so. keep talking. What? Walk over here. What? Just keep walking,talk. Holden. Holden. Can you hear me? Holden. It's you. He's tracking you. He's following your voice. well,that's why there's no mention of brain atrophy in the c.t. Report. Because there isn't any. None? He's been p.v.s. For 16 years. Well,he's not p.v.s. He's minimally conscious. He's minimally conscious and no one noticed? He was in a regular nursing home so they just. missed it. He's been frozen, sleeping,for 16 years, and they missed it. That sucks. There's one thing to be thankful for. What? We might be able to wake him up. Alex, it's Izzie. If you're not coming, you could at least have the decency to call and tell me. I'm in hell. I'm the one in hell. Burke's going all "iron chef" in the kitchen. Get your ass back here and save me. I'm in the woods with shotguns and liquor and car talk. It's like "deliverance" out here. Come on. Let's race. At least you've got liquor. Where does Meredith keep the booze? I don't think she has any. How is that possible? She's a w.a.s.p. Liquor's like oxygen to a w.a.s.p. Which is why we're out of liquor. Listen,can you come and get me? Okay,how am I supposed to get through the holidays without liquor,George? Just come and get me. Hello? Cris selfish! Derek,it's me. Where are you? Which one do you think she is? Holden's wife? It's her. How do you know? Mrs. Mckee? It's Mrs. Leonard now. What do you mean, wake him up? Over the years, your husband's brain has been slowly trying heal itself. Now we've given him a course of amphetamine that should give his brain the push it needs to find consciousness. When? How long does it take? If we're right, your father will be awake in a few hours. Is he gonna realize what happened? Most patients in this situation have no idea how much time has passed. Oh,my god. I'm gonna be sick. I know this is a difficult situation. I just got married. We're having a baby in december. Coby turned 17 on thursday. Difficult? This is unimaginable. Mrs. Leonard, perhaps you should. I can't be here when he wakes up. He can't see me like this or Coby. Coby,baby,we're leaving. We'll be in the car. Mrs. Leonard. holden is going to wake up and find out that we didn't wait for him. It took her a long time to move on. What are you doing up here? Get down to the pit. We're backed up. No can do,sir. The nazi has me on this surgery. We've got a line out the door for sutures. Everybody's an amateur chef until they get a knife in their hands. Knives can be tricky. Your wife know you're working today? I'm going home. I just wanted to watch a little bit. Don't stay here too long. You could end up like him. Wife stabbed him. Said she didn't like the way he was carving the turkey. - Happy Thanksgiving. - Joe,thank god. Hey,this is my boyfriend Walter. Whatever. Tell me you brought liquor. I brought pie Pumpkin. You're a bartender. Did you bring scalpels? Come on. Pick a car. I don't want to pick a car. He doesn't know jack about cars. I know plenty. I just don't want to pick one. Georgie's just tired. They working you too hard at the hospital? You know he works 48-hour shifts? - 48 hours,and you enjoy it? - Yeah,  I enjoy it. Like,what do you do? You know medical stuff. Come on. They're not gonna get it. Make your brothers jealous. Tell them what it's like to be a big-time surgeon. Okay,last night, this was pretty cool, I assisted on a truncal vagotomy, - and we inflated this, - assisted? - - What do you mean? - I helped the surgeon. Anyway,we inflated this guy's abdomen with a carbon wait,I thought you were the surgeon. I'm a surgical intern. The resident or the attending, they perform the surgery. Oh,so you don't actually cut anybody open? I mean, by yourself. No,like,the point of being an intern is that you're learning. We watch the surgeries and the attending asks us questions and we have to answer them. It's not easy. I have to be on top of my game 100% of the time. It's incredibly difficult. So you don't actually do anything? - Yes,I do. - You just stand there. - No, l and - watch the real doctors work. I am a real doctor. - No,you're not. - You said you just stand there. You said you don't do anything. No,I didn't no, you said I didn't do anything. Real doctors save lives,Georgie. - I mean,if you're just standing there -  for god what? I want to go home. Just as soon as you shoot your turkey. What are you doing here? Waiting for my patient to wake up. Why aren't you at The Thanksgiving? Why aren't you at Thanksgiving? What? I tell you something, you tell me something. okay. I feel like one of those people who's so freaking miserable they can't be around normal people like I'll infect the happy people like I'm some miserable,diseased, dirty ex-mistress. Your turn. I failed the medical boards. If I tell Izzie, she'll be nice about it, all supportive and optimistic. She might as well rip my nads off and turn 'em into earrings. Alex,you should go to Thanksgiving. I mean,don't tell her if you don't want to. But you should go. Otherwise,you're just me. A miserable,diseased, dirty ex-mistress. That's hot. That's really hot. I feel better already. See? Oh. Happy Thanksgiving. hello? Is somebody there? Somebody yes. Somebody's here. have suffered deterioration and your joints will be painful for awhile, which is to be expected. Now the fact that your communication skills are still intact is remarkable. Did you reach my wife yet? Is she coming? I mean have you told her or do you wait until she gets here? Because this is gonna quite a shock. How long have I been out? What a year? Would you excuse us? No,you tell me,please. You found me. You tell me. I'm only an intern. I've never really done this before. Me either. You'll do it quickly. Rip off the bandage. No anesthesia. Exactly. I'll be right outside if you need me. Truth time. Truth time. You have to cut the celery into finer pieces,Stevens. like that? It'll do. Put them in with the onions. Now what should you be concerned about? the turkey,Stevens. I'd expect you to know that. Right. I need to check the turkey to make sure it's cooking at the correct temperature. Yeah,and how do we do that? Meat thermometer. 10 bucks says she dries out the turkey. 20 says she pulls it off. 75 says I don't care. Ooh,okay,Stevens. Let's see what you can do. More pressure. Turkey has a tough shell. Dig in. I'm in. Damn,she got it in. Told you she's gonna pull it off. Not bad. Now all you have to do now is stick the thermometer deep enough in the bird to get a temp, but be careful not to You hit the bone. The pan is filling with juice and you're losing moisture. What do you do? think. That's it. I'm out of here. What's the problem? You're operating on a turkey. And and you're making friends with my friends. You told me to be nice. You know,be nice. You know,I'm just gonna go to the store and get some liquor. Give me the keys, please. I'll I'll be back. Dr. Burke! Suction. Use the baster and suction. The gt 500 was a shelby. He also made the viper. You know that? Yes,we do know. the shelby 500 is a good car. And the other car he made Turkey. Jerry. we came out here so I could shoot a turkey. Dad said we're not leaving until I shoot a turkey. I am shooting this turkey. when you're sure you've got it, squeeze. no fair. I called turkey. don't worry about it. He's not gonna do it. He's gonna chicken out and then you can yahoo! He got it. I got it? Yo got it,Georgie! Let's go home! What's he like? M-my son. You know,I didn't really get a chance to speak with him. But he seemed nice. He's,uh,tall,like you. And he's got your eyes. That that's good. Holden,we're ready to begin. What does the m.r.i. Do? Just gives us a better picture of your brain,really. You're one for the books, you know? That's nice. How's he doing? As well as we could expect. Damn it. An epidural hematoma. When you fell out of bed this morning, you hit your temple,hard. The c.t. Didn't catch it but the m.r.i. Did. And you can fix it? It won't be easy. Sometimes,it's impossible to find the vessel and complications can arise, but,yes I can operate. So there is a risk? A very large risk,yes. And what happens if you don't operate? The best-case scenario is that the bleeding resolves itself. Or it could continue to bleed and cause the brain to swell. Which means what? Most likely, without the operation,you'll die. But the operation could kill me,too,right? They're equal risks both ways. What do I do? What would you do? I can't answer this for you. Can I have that spatula,please? Thank you. You want that butter to melt,not to boil. Dr. Burke,how did you learn to cook like this? My mother owns a restaurant in Alabama. Seriously? Seriously. Does Cristina know that? No. Actually, she doesn't. She doesn't ask a lot of personal questions. She's kind of hard to get to know. Yes,she is. Karev didn't show. No,he didn't. Is that okay? No,it's not. Do you know that there's absolutely no liquor in this house? Cristina went to get some. Over an hour ago. Where is she? Levi Johnson. Swallowed a wishbone? yes. Excellent. We'll have to take some films. Maybe you ruptured your esophagus,huh? That means surgery. Car's loaded. Guys,coolers,come on. Get up,get up,get up. Dad,come on. Hold on,Georgie. We gotta blood you. no. Now there you go. Now you're officially an O'malley man. O'malley! Thank you. I left my hat. I'll be right back. O'malley! Guys,get just get in the car. O'malley! O'malley! 21-gun salute for Georgie. Okay,that's not the best idea,guys. I'm serious. You shot dad in the ass! Are you happy now?! guys,this is the trauma room. What are you doing? Put it down. Dad,I'm gonna inject you with something to numb the area. I'm fine. I don't need anything. It doesn't even hurt that bad. Dad,you have bird shot embedded in your gluteus maximus. When I start removing it, believe me, it's gonna hurt veryad. Hey,'65 gto. That's a v-8 tweaker. You don't want that. What you want is the bel air. But it's gotta be the 2-tone,right? Nice. Ah,pick a car, Georgie. No,thanks. Come on,Georgie. Pick a car. I told you he doesn't know jack about cars. He doesn't know jack about jack. Jerry first you say the gto, ronny counters with the bel air, which never fails to make dad say the gt 500. The cobra, the chieftain, then someone names a german car, which invariably starts the american versus foreign debate that usually ends when one of you brings up the deville, and that always,always leads to the unbelievably long discussion on the merits of the '57 thunderbird. So how about I just jump to the end and name the thunderbird now so that once in our lives, we can stop picking cars?! And my name is George! What do you know? The kid came back. No,he didn't. He says we have the same eyes. Yeah. I don't see it. He said that he couldn't stay because of the holiday. But he he said he'll come back sometime soon. Good. He said she's happy. that this guy Hal is,really good for her. She loves him. So I've decided to, go ahead with the surgery. You know, they've moved on. I should,too. You know,get this thing out of my head and get on with my life. Right. I'll,tell Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Grey. Do you think he really will come back? I hope so. Joe and Walter have got the table set up in the living room. How's our bird? He needs a few more hours. Why did you plan this big dinner if you knew you couldn't cook? I just like Thanksgiving, Dr. Burke. Preston. Preston. You just like Thanksgiving? We work 18 hours a day, 6 days a week, 50 weeks a year. We don't really have any time for our families. We don't have friends that aren't doctors. But we have this one day, one day where we get to be like everybody else. One day to be normal. A day where. nobody lives and nobody dies on our watch. It's like a gift. So I just thought we should appreciate it. That's all. I gotta set the table. a day without surgery. Who swallows a wishbone whole? Dr. Bailey,why are you working on Thanksgiving? You work the extra shifts and get the extra practice. And I'm trying to get in all the practice I can. before the baby comes and I have to take time off. My husband isn't thrilled I'm working Thanksgiving, but he isn't a surgeon. So he doesn't get it. You and Dr. Burke? Yes. he would've made a good father. You coming? Not enough interns. I gotta cover the floor. what would you have done if you were him? Would you have the surgery? You would have the surgery. I would want the future. Or to be asleep again. One or the other. Nothing in between. I honestly don't know what I would want. I know you don't. If you get a chance, you can scrub in later. I'll probably be at this awhile. I thought you'd forgotten about me. No. Where are Ronny and Jerry? The nurse told them that the cafeteria was open. You didn't have fun today. It's not that. No. No,I didn't have fun. You hurt your brothers' feelings. Dad you did. They talk to me like I'm stupid. They call me "Georgie." They've never treated me like I'm one of them. George,Jerry is dry cleaner. Ronny works in the post office. I drive a truck. You're a surgeon. You're not one of us. I know it and they know it. And you make sure know it. Dad. I'm not. I'm not blaming you. It makes me proud you're so smart, like I did something right. It's just. we try. We try to include you, but you don't like the stuff that we like. And we don't know how to talk about the stuff you wanna talk about. You're not one of us. But,damn it,we don't treat you like you're stupid. You treat us like we're stupid. And maybe we are, but we're your family. Give us an inch,Georgie. Every once in awhile pick a car. I saved a guy's life on an elevator last month. I performed open-heart surgery on him right there. By yourself? By myself. Just like a real doctor. Whew. Now that's something. Oh,I mean,that's really something. I'll take care of it. What are you doing here? Oh,this is beyond bad. sorry,Izzie,it's after 8. I gotta get to the bar. On Thanksgiving? It's one of our busiest days of the year. People need a safe haven from the bitterness,loneliness, quality family time. I'm their port in the storm. See you later? Good night,doc. Night,Joe. Bye,walter. Thanks for coming. You can leave,too, if you want. I'not leaving the table until the hostess does. They're not coming. Even so. Today,I committed bird murder and I was forced to touch my dad's ass. I get extra points for showing up at all. I brought booze. Let's just eat. You know today in the waiting room, how did you know Cheryl was Holden's wife? Waiting rooms are full of people hoping for good news. She was the on one who looked like she had completely given up. Do you love her? I don't know. It's good that you're trying. You wouldn't be you if you weren't the kind of person who was trying to make it work. You think so? It means I wasn't wrong about you. Thanks. good-bye,Derek. Good-bye,Meredith. maybe we're not supposed to be happy. Maybe gratitude has nothing to do with joy. You going inside? No. You go ahead. You sure? Go make her happy. Maybe being grateful means recognizing what you have for what it is. you're a surgical junkie. Go home! Adele's already mad. I'm in trouble no matter what. An there's a whipple happening in o.r. 2. Go home right now. This kind of treatment is why they call you the nazi. Appreciating small victories. Happy Thanksgiving. I was nice. I noticed. You don't ask a lot of personal questions. And you're very hard to get to know. yes. My mother owns a restaurant in Alabama. I scrubbed in on a foreign body removal this afternoon. A guy swallowed a wishbone whole. admiring the struggle it takes simply to be human. you didn't show. I waited. Derek,are you done? Hurting me back, I mean. Cause I need to know because if not,I I got to special order a thicker skin or something. And maybe we're thankful for the familiar things we know. no anesthesia guy here we go and maybe we're thankful for the thing we'll never know is this seat taken? Do you work at the hospital? No. You're not a brain surgeon or a doctor of any kind? No. Then this seat isn't taken. at the end of the day, the fact that we have the courage to still be standing. do you want to buy me a drink?
