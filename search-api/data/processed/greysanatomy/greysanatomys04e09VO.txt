You are nowhere near hard-core enough to commit to cardio. Why isn't this easier? I don't know. Well,I want my best friend back. You deserve the jo I should've given it to you in t first place. Things are gonna be different from here on in. Your love lives,your hopes and dreams, the little joys and tragedies that make you who you are have no place in my hospital. This is our son. He's beautiful. we got into medicine because we want to save lives. We go into medicine because we want to do good. We go into medicine for the rush, for the high, for the ride. You're not dancing. I'm too tense to dance. Which is why we're dancing. My problem is,I'm sleeping with a man who's dating. And I don't care if he dates sydney. It's the woman he dates after sydney,that's my problem. And if I had any sense at all,I would break up with the breakup sex. There would be no more breakup sexing. -If I had any sense. -shut up! Dance it out. But what we remember at the end of most days are the losses. What we lay awake at night replaying is. the pain we caused or failed to cure,the lives we ruined or failed to save. You know,I'm gonna tell him. I don't want him seeing other people. Good. Fine. Whatever. I'm gonna tell him,and I feel good about it. Dancing makes you brave. So the experience of practicing medicine rarely resembles the goal. The experience,too often,is ass-backwards and upside down. I am so sick of meredith and cristina and their stupid love affair with each other that they have to rub in everyone's faces. It's. stupid dancing. Friggin' bobbsey twins. Stupid. you're ranting. It's kinda early in the morning for ranting. We're supposed to be the happy ones. We should be dancing,george. Why aren't we dancing? You want to dance? Whatever. I'm gonna go in early. I'm gonna get on hard-core erica hahn cardio,and I'm gonna kick ass at it. And when I kick ass at cardio,it's gonna piss cristina off, but it won't matter,because I'll be a kick-ass cardio god. I'm justaying,you're never here. J. hold on,hold on. I mess up the rotation schedule,the residents are gonna dog me all week. Okay. You're never here. I'm here in the mornings. I'm here at night. You're here between midnight and 6:00 A. M. I'm chief resident now. and I'm loading the dishwasher! hi. You volunteered to stay home with t-u-c-K. Who else was gonna take care of t-u-c-k? I'm late for work. Okay. Hey,honey. We need to talk. Okay. Uh,take the baby by your mom,and meet me for lunch,okay? We'll talk then. Well,why can't we talk here? 'Cause I'm only here between the hours of midnight and 6:00 A.M. Now come on. Now just meet me for lunch,tucker. Come on now. -Lunch. -Yes,lunch. thatcher's not my problem. -He can get drunk all he wants. I don't care. -Right. I don't care about lexie,either. She's a big girl. She can take care of herself. You talk about them an awful lot for someone who doesn't care. You care because you're you. Yore gonna make me late for my meeting with sloan. Well,okay then,go. What? Nothing. I'M. gonna be late. I'm late for sloan's meeting. Yeah,so am I. Also,I'm not speaking to you. I'm still not speaking to you. You don't have to speak. Late for sloan. okay,ladies and gentlemen,this is nick hanscomb. Hi. Nick was lucky enough to have me remove a large carotid body tumor from his neck. The fact that I was able to get clean boundaries is pretty darn impressive,even for me. -Congratulations. -Don't interrupt. Now despite the fact that it was a wildly successful surgery, we had to dissect out deep lymph nodes in his neck. There is now only a delicate flap of skin between his carotid artery and the outside world. That said,what am I worried about? I would think given the friability of the skin, that there's a great possibility that the,um,the artery could blow? Right. oh,don't worry. I've. I've heard this before. If that happens,whoever's in the room, I don't care if it's a doctor,a nurse,an orderly, your job is to stop the bleeding then page me,in that order. Are we clear? Any questions? They look scared. They're medical professionals,nick. A healthy level of fear is encouraged. Okay,then. Uh,if I do die,it will have been lovely meeting you all. See? The patient is confident. You should be confident. That's it. what do we got? Jacob nolston,47,status post a double bypass surgery two weeks ago, now presents febrile with pain and tenderness in his surgical incisions. We got a 10-car pileup on the freeway. You mind taking him from here? Oh,you got it. okay,I need a gurney for the transfer. I'll page hahn. Sounds like we all agree. Get him inside and flip for it. You're in good hands,Mr. Nolston. Thank you,gentlemen. on three. One,two,three. When are you gonna realize you're in over your head? when are you gonna realize that you don't own the cardio department? He's my patient. I got here first. Dibs. hey,you guys. You can't call dibs on a human being. You guys,I think we should move. -Let go of the gurney. -You let go.

We'll call the coroner. Let me check your injuries. -No. Is she dead? -*** No,but she looks postictal. She's also got a bad elbow dislocation and a weak pulse. She was driving,she was talking to me. She just started convulsing,and then we slammed into that other rig. All right. You think you can move? Yeah. hey,now you know I need to stabilize you. You know the drill. My c-spine's clear. I can.

Strong and stable. two words that have never been used to describe me,ever. You're a pretty girl. I hope you don't think that's rude. I'm just. I haven't been allowed to notice that kind of thing for a while and. now I'm allowed. You're allowed to notice prettiness? Well,I'm allowed to notice,uh,other women,women other than my girlfriend. My now,uh,ex-girlfriend. Oh,I'm sorry. yeah,giant neck tumors weren't her thing. She left you because of the tumor? Of course not. No. She left me because,uh,I didn't make her laugh anymore,and,uh, she had just lost that lovin' feeling. She left you because of the tumor. -That sucks. -Yep. Y-you seeing anyone? I'm j.

But then it turnedut she really was just a vapid narcissist. -Ouch. -Yeah. So you really like this guy? Even though he doesn't have a super cool exposed carotid artery? yeah,I do. what's going on in the pit? You just wiped the surgical board. Oh,uh,a couple of ambulances crashed into each other, so I'm canceling all electives to free up the O.R.S for emergent surgeries. Are we friends yet? I'm sorry? Friends. Are we friends? I-I know I just learned your name and all,rose,but I. I'd like to think I could call you a friend. Why? Because if i'm your friend,I could tell you about the licorice stuck in your teeth. Whereas a mere acquaintance,I'd smile politely and pretend it wasn't there. -thank you. -yeah. -jacob. -dad. hey,guys. you okay? what happened to your leg? There was a. a little accident,but,uh,I'mkay. It doesn't hurt. Well,what kind of an accident? -Um,the ambulances crashed. -The ambulances crashed? Sandra,tell your mother not to panic.

And I need you to manipulate the pectoral muscles so we don't leave a giant hole in the man's chest.Can you make time? Can you make time for a drink with me after? Did I mention time is a factor here? I'm looking for a yes or no answer. As am I. this may be enjoyable to you,Dr. Sloan but I have a patient in serious condition. I came to you because legend has it that you're the best in plastics. But if bad jokes and sleazy come-ons are what I'm in for all afternoon, I'll page whoever's second best. Dr. Hahn. I apologize. - And I'll clear my schedule. - Thank you. O.R.One. Uh,why don't you clean this up here and,uh, clear my schedule,and you can scrub in? Thank you. Sorry about that. I'm sorry.I'll be right back. So. coffee? - I can'T. - You can't? When I was your patient,you made time for me. 'Cause you were my patient. And here I thought it was 'cause you liked me. Look,I'm really sorry. I gotta finish up with this patient, and then I'm scrubbing in on a surgery, and it's one I've never seen before. - Can I watch? - What? Can I watch the.the surgery? - Can I.can you sneak me in? - No. - You know how much trouble I'd get in for that? - Come on. Since when are you a rule follower? There's always a dozen people in the back of the O.R. - And there's a gallery. - Ava. Please. We're ready to go. Hold off for a moment.His wife's arriving. Stan,sara's here. Stan,wake up,man.Sara's here. Wake up! That's good. That's good. Baby? Baby. Hey. your x-ray shows that the metal's embedded in your femur, so I'm gonna go in and remove it while Dr. Hahn and Dr. Sloan repair the damage caused by the infection. Repair the damage? They're removing my chest bone. Why is this all happening? My kids shouldn't have to see me this way. It's a dad's job to worry.You worry about your kids. worry about 'em every day of their lives. But they aren't supposed to have to worry about dad. They aren't supposed to have to comfort their mom. why am I back here? - My kids. - your kids are fine. They're taking care of each other,and they're fine. Lucy was hungry,and the others were,too, so your wife took them to the cafeteria. The point is,th're fine. They just want their dad to get better. You'll keep an eye on 'em? When I'm in surgery,you'll keep them updated? 'Cause my wife,she,uh. huh,she gets panicky if she doesn't know what's going on. I will keep her updated. Uh,I would like to borrow Dr. Yang. It's important.Can you spare her? Torres,can I steal stevens off your service? I'll give her away for free. - Yang's all yours,Dr. Bailey. - Thank you. Yang,stevens. Dr. Yang,Dr. Bailey has requested your capable hands. Dr. Stevens,take over prepping Mr. Nolston for surgery. But what.wait. oh,just take it up with Dr. Bailey,yang. Hey. Hey. - Mary's scans come up yet? - not yet. What's going on with you and stevens? Just because I don't sleep in your house anymore doesn't mean I don't hear the gossip. Why arwe talking about this?We don't talk. oh,you're. you miss meredith and you're clinging. I'm not clinging. - Oh,a little bit,you're clinging. - No,I'm just making small talk. Ah,um,okay. here we go. tumor. look,I'm hurt.I'm.I'm really hurt here. You just lie there and try not to die. Someone will be here soon to save the master race from extinction. - Oh,okay. - Dr. Bailey,can i talk to you a minute? I mean no disrespect, but can you please tell me you have an amazingly good reason for pulling me off of Dr. Hahn's service when you know I have been fighting tooth and nail to get into her good graces? You're not black. But you're not white either. Dr. Yang will be examining you. Oh,come on.Are you kidding? Okay,you have medical training. How long do you think you have to live if you have internal injuries? Exactly. I seriously recommend you let this fine doctor examine you. Dr. Yang,give him the best medical treatment possible. It's the law. Sir,I need you to move your hands. Look,I-I just didn't want her to see. I thought she might take offense,you know? I'm not gonna leave you. I'm not leaving here right now without you.Okay? I've never seen her before. What? I've never seen her before. I've worked inhis hospital all this time, and before today,she was a complete stranger to me. It happens.It's a big hospital. I've never met her before,and yet, I'm the person who handed her the worst day of her life. In her story,that's who I am. That's who I'll always be. That's theob. that's the job.I know. Look at me. This day,this day you feel helpless. This day makes all those other days when you fight to save a life and lose. this day makes you grateful you have a chance to do anything at all. You take it in. it's time. can you go easy?I'm injured here. You've had plenty of morphine.You'll be fine. It's not like you're in a concentration camp or anything. You know,when people are young or.or drunk,they get tattoos. They wake up to regret it. Oh,so you regret it? You gotta treat me like anyone else. That's the beauty of this country. Oh,yes,it is. So. you're gonna drill into my skull? O'malley. Dr. Shepherd's gonna do what we call a cookie craniotomy. Uh,he's gonna drill a very,very small hole, and then with a computer,he's going to guide the scope through your brain. It's as minimally invasive as possible. It's just. it's weird,you know,to be on the other side of all this. How are stan and ray. and shane?Oh,my god. Oh,my god.How did this happen? she's seizing. I always knew you were an ass,but seriously, you brought jane doe into the gallery? Are you trying to get yourself kicked out of the program? She wanted to see what I do. I thought you were seeing lexie. I'm a popular guy. I'm sure whatever you're talking about is endlessly fascinating, Dr. Karev,but I kind of had my heart set on saving a life today. Sorry. so.let's begin. Hey.Nurse olivia said you needed to see me.Are you okay? My book is bad, and I hate daytime televisio and all my friends are at work. Yeah,well,I'm at work,too.I'm an intern. I'm supposed to be learning things. You can.you can learn about my artery. You can never know too much about arteries,right? Come on.I have no one to talk to. - Fine,but I'm taking your vitals again. - Okay. So,uh,you want to help me plot my revenge? Girlfriend? Here's what I'm thinking. I page her here,and then,uh,you know,I'm all,like," I'm dying,and I just need to gaze at your beauty one last time," and then. and then she gets here,and I flash her the artery. - It's mean. - Right? - I like it. - Okay.Can you get me a phone? Gentlemen,the moment they pull apart the rig, we're gonna come in and grab you. You take sn,first. Once we get in there and assess,then we'll see who goes first. No,you take stan first. You take stan first. Ray. I think I'm gonna be okay. I'm starting to feel a little better. - Don't you screw with me. - No. No,I'm probably not as bad as I think. I'm probably just paralyzed. Richard. you think maybe that I can get out of here just paralyzed,right? It's possible.It happens. Really? See? O-okay.Okay. Is my wife inside? - She won't see any of this? - No. You'll be where I can look at you? I'm right here,where you can look at me. Then let's do this. Try to live,man. You,too. stop.Stop. Stop!Stop! Make them stop! Stop!Stop! What the hell are you doing? It's stan! Ray.ray's back. it's in deep. He'll bleed out if you move us. It's the oxygen regulator. It's embedded in his back. Ray!Ray,you still with us? I'm here,chief.I'm still here. But my pulse is weak. okay,he's sweaty and breathing fast,and with the angle of that regulator. it's cardiac tamponade. If that regulator caused a tear in his heart and we move him, the regulator could move. It'll make the tear bigger. Please let's don't flood my heart.Please. We'll stabilize him in the ambulance. Stan. you're a hero,man. You saved ray's life. Stan? Damn it,stan.Stan. go get the ultrasound so we can be sure, and bring a crash cart just in case, and go find where hahn is. Hey.Films are up. Yeah,there's intraperitoneal bleeding. His liver looks completely ruptured. Yeah,he's gonna need a laparotomy, but maybe it'll be pretty straightforward. Oh,so I can get back to hahn's service? -Or not? -No. - If I have to work on this man,so do you. - Why? You don't need me. He has a swastika on his abdomen,a giant black swastika. My stepfather's parents died in auschwitz. okay. You and I will do this. We will do this and we will consider ourselves having risen above. We'll rise...above. You're busted. Save it. you're using a cable instead of wires,Dr. Sloan. I've never seen it done that way before. Tension banding.Learned it back in new york. I moved there after columbia to study under john seever. He was a great surgeon. He died last year. I was wrecked,couldn't sleep for weeks. It was like losing my own father. What,are we on a date here? I was complimenting your surgical skills,Dr. Sloan, not looking for a window into your wounded soul.clamp,please. You can't operate. I won't sign the consent form. You need the surgery. You will die without the surgery. You may die with the surgery,but your chance of living is greatly increased if you let me operate. And it's just gonna be you two in there? - Yes. - No. I need to have at least one white doctor in that operating room so you don't kill me on the table. -No offense. -No offense? Did he just say no offense? - Shepherd. - Yeah. I need o'malley. We're about to go into surgery. I need o'malley. You okay,Dr. Bailey? Don't cross me. Oh,I wasn't crossing you. I'm rising above. I am rising above and do not want to be crossed while I'm busy rising. I have to operate on a white supremacist, and he has requested a white doctor to watch me to make sure that I don't kill his crazy white hind. Now I need o'malley. Can I have him or not? Yeah,o'malley,go with Dr. Bailey. Yes,sir. Get him to sign the consent, then have him anesthetized and ready. Dr. Bailey,you're well within your rights to pass this on to somebody else. Well,that would make me like him, and I'm not like him. Oh,sorry,Dr. Shepherd, I'm running behind today. I'll be out of your way in just a second. Well,actually,rose,I'm early,so technically,I'm in your way. Oh,well,in that case,don't let it happen again. You're staring at my chest. What? I think maybe you're intending to admire my ring, but it's coming off as you staring at my chest. Oh,sorry.It's just that,uh,you wear your engagement ring on your necklace. When I was engaged,I wore it on my finger. Now,yeah,necklace. The stone was my grandmother's. I don't want to lose it. -Sorry.-Sorry,why? About your engagement. Did you call it off recently? well,that's a pretty personal question. Yeah,well,we're friends now. I mean,I saved you hours of potential licorice humiliation, so I think you can. it ended a year ago,and you have nothing to be sorry about. - It was never gonna work out. - How come? Because I was always very clear about what I wanted,and he wasn't. And there's no way to build a future on that. Yeah. Please,please.I-I can't be in here! I'm gonna die in here! no,no,ray,ray!Ray,you can't do that. You have to stay perfectly still. You cannot move. ray,look at me. Don't look at stan.Look at me. You are not gonna die today. Okay?Say it. I'm not gonna die. You are not going to die today. He'll need a pericardiocentesis if it's a tamponade, but we need to get an ultrasound to be sure. I can do it.I can get in. - Meredith. - I can fit. Dr. Bailey. I'm calling on jesus this time. Don't bother me when I'm calling on jesus. I don't do it very often. He might not hear me. Scalpel. it's amazing,isn't it? The...how tenical it all is, how impersonal? They're...they're basically just mechanics,but,like, god's mechanics because what they're actually doing down there is saving a life. so you're a-a surgeon? Surgical intern,first year. What about you? Oh,um.I'm not actually supposed to be here. The guy that I'm...I'm,you know. your...your husband? No.No,no,not my husband. The guy that.anyways,I'm just...I wanted to see him operate. Oh,Dr. Sloan. Oh,I get it. No,no,I'm not judging.I mean, he's kind of insanely hot. We...he is,but I'm not... I'm not with him.I'm with...him. Do you know him? No.No,I-I don't knowim at all. I'm supposed to be having lunch with my husband,o'malley. Yes,ma'am. I'm supposed to be having lunch with my husband, and instead I am elbow deep in a nazi's gut. Yes,ma'am. No one better ever call me "nazi" again. okay a little suction right there,please. that's good...Good.Okay. All right.I should be able to access the tumor now. what's going on?Did we lose power? No,the other monitors are fine. It must be the stereotactic computer. nothing.It's dead. Are you kiddme? I'm in the woman's brain. Are you kidding me? The navigational system is dead? she should we try to get another machine? Look, if I remove the probe without a guide, it won't be just the machine that's dead. Call the company. Tell them to get over here as quickly as possible. Tell 'em we need somebody here now. take it slow,grey. There's...there's glass all around you. I'm sorry,stan. Oh,I'm so sorry. Here. He's okay. He doesn't mind. We're losing him,chief. Okay,get in there,grey.Don't worry about stan.Just get in there. - Hey. - Hi. You,uh,checking in on me again? Yep. Will you call me strong and stable again? Let's hope. What's wrong with you? What makes you think something's wrong? Well,your cheeks are all flushed,which they. they weren't earlier. Is it creeping you out,how observant I am? I'm sorry.It's the...it's the boredom, I'm telling you. remember your girlfriend who just turned out to be a vapid narcissist? Your boyfriend turned out to just be a jerk. Jerk,ass,and many dirtier words that are inappropriate for me to use in front of a patient. I'm sorry. Yeah,me,too. Well,you want me to help you plot your revenge? - Okay. - Okay. Here's what I'm thinking. you go out with me. Just like that.bam.new boyfriend. And he'll be all,"what's he got that I don't have? " And you'll be all,"carotid artery. exposed.Top that,loser. " And he'll be all,"I can'T. - I can't top that.
