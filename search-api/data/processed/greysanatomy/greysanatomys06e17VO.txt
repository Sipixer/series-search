(exhales)</i> And once we win, we get a new game.</i> Today... Feels like the day to me. I think by the close of business today, I've got cartilage in a bottle. (groans) What's with you? You and derek. You're all, "don't screw the nurses and the drug reps." You did a psych rotation. You know what happens when you tell someone Not to think about an elephant? You spend a lot of time thinking about an-- I walk around the hospital Trying not to make eye contact with the women. I'm... Lonely And unhappy. I don't see how this is a solution. Find a grown-up who wants what you want and date... Like a grown-up. I don't know what that means. (groans) (woman) Ã¢Â™Âª ...To make a clear mind Ã¢Â™Âª Oncology's kept you busy-- two rounds of chemo, Brachytherapy, two rounds of external radiation. Not to mention coenzymes, shark cartilage, Milk thistle. I'm open to, you know, pretty much anything. Except surgery. That's because surgery's not gonna work. We'd like to hear all the options. Well, your scans will be back any moment, And I'll have a look-- let me tell you what you'll see. My tumor's the size of a football. Audrey-- It's wrapped around my organs. And if you try to cut it ovt, it'll kill me. (sighs) that's what you'll see. We push ourselves. Residents, attendings-- It doesn't matter how much we achieve.</i> If you're a climber, there's always another mountain. Uh, hunt.</i> Mm. These are your scans. Mm-hmm. I was just looking around. Uh, that's quite a tumor. Huge. There's probably nothing to be done. (richard) hmm. You mind if I take a stab at it? Well, it sounds strange to you, I'm sure, but, uh, I only have a few years left in the game, And there may not be so many big tumors left for me. Of course. Yore welcome to it. (whispering) what are you doing? Thanks, hunt. You're a good egg. What are you doing? I'm sure you've got work to do, dr. Yang. Mm-hmm. (elevator bell dings) Chart. Oh. Ugh. (mouths words) (clears throat) (normal voice) what are you doing? What? This is a monster case, and he just stole it from you With some crap about mortality and old men? He's playing you. What are you doing?! All right, all right. Um... Dr. Webber. Transcript by Addic7ed.com Dr. Webber, I'd like to keep audrey taylor. She was my case-- you gave it to me. Oh, no, you swiped it. Cristina-- 'cause it's got harper avery written all over it. When dr. Avery was here, he did mention That I need to dive back into my research. This case would be perfect for that-- richard, this thing is a monster. At best it's damage control. I'd be operating by the seat of my pants. On the contrary. A tumor like this Calls for a methodical analysis of the scans, a careful plan-- old-school, which-- Old? Wow. I didn't see that coming. I-I didn't not mean your age. I meant the approach. Let's not make this personal. You just did, ginger. (elevator bell dings) and you're right. I've been resecting tumors since you were in diapers. In my experience, they demand something A little me elegant than "by the seat of your pants." this is my patient.</i> L-- good morning. Why are we auing? (cristina) that. Wow. Big. Whose patient is this? (owen and richard) mine. Work on it together. Well, the harper avery is an individual award. Ah, I see where this is going. A case like this needs an aggressive approach that-- Sloppy. It requires a methodical analysis-- Some would say outmoded. Outmoded? Yeah. All right. There's nothing wrong With a little friendly, professional competition. Come up with plans, present 'em to me. I will choose. Dr. Yang, dr. Grey will assist. Yes. I'm with webber. What? He's got it in the bag. (scoffs) Sir. "I'm with webber"? Why'd you push me to do it in the first place? Now you'll know what your plan is And what his plan is. Wait. You're-- you're gonna spy on him? That's--that's cheating. You're adorable when you're slow. You have a dark, dark mind. (elevator bell dings) (chuckles) Here. Thanks. Hey. You working tonight? Uh, no. I'm going to yoga class. Yeah, there's nothing about that statement That makes any sense. Tuck's with his father, And the facist vegan next door Gave me a yoga class for christmas. No. You're having dinner with me.</i> Uh, the facist vegan thinks That yoga's going to make me a better person, Which is unlikely, But if I don't go, I'll have to hear about it every time-- "well, my back kinda hurts, but the breathing. I've never breathed like that before in my life." what? That's what people say after their first yoga class. Tell her that. Have dinner with me. (elevator bell dings) come on. Now try it. My back kinda hurts, but the breathing. I... I've never breathed like that in my life. More conviction. I've never breathed like that in my life.</i> There you go. (laughs) (sighs) (computer keys clicking) (woman speaks indistinctly over p.A.)</i> What? This, um, this patient-- I can't find the heartbeat. So call the morgue, 40-watt. He's not dead. He's sitting up. He's talking. Dude, you're lucky you have a famous last name. Take a deep breath, sir. I'm having... Trouble doing that. Oh, grow up, todd. When he was 9, they removed his right lung. And now the other one's crapping out on me. Or maybe you're having an anxiety attack Because I just asked you to move in with me. I can't find his heart. Oh, yeah? Me neither. No, I really can't. So who's the 40-watt now? I can't... I can't-- oh, whoa. Get a stat chest x-ray and page cardio. (grunts) There she is... By your kidney. My heart is by my kidney? That's why it was hard to hear your heartbeat. And without a second lung in your chest cavity, Your heart sort of drifted. It's called post-pneumonectomy syndrome. And the shifting caused some bronchial compression. That's why you weren't able to breathe. I'm the biggest bitch in the world. Can you put it back where it goes? Yes, we're gonna use saline implants in your chest To keep it in place. Implants? Like what they use for-- fake boobs. You want to put-- I can't have-- No. We're--I--I'm a guy. Okay? I'm a guy's guy. Well, you won't actually see them. Yeah, but still. I mean, come on, man. You know what I'm saying. I mean, how am I supposed to, you know-- what? Pick up women? You mean how do you explain your boobs To the next chick who's dumb enough to date you? Molly. Molly. (door closes) Do I have a choice? Do you like to breathe? (owen) so, yes, there is a surgical option. We're just-- Uh, we're still figuring out the best approach. The risks with the surgery are very high. The tumor has compromised the organs to the point Where anything we do to try to remove it would-- would kill me. Audrey, ple--you're not even listening to them. Okay, it doesn't make sense. I just want one more month. I'm not gonna risk dying before that. One more month? (clears throat) our daughter's getting married In a month. And I would like to see her do that. I would... I would like to see her on the happiest day of her life. Mrs. Taylor, if we don't try the surgery, You might not make it through the month. (sighs) Then... I look forward to hearing... What you come up with. (mouths word) Hi, I'm dr. Grey. Hi. Uh, he's really hot And his stomach's hurting so much. (moaning) he was fine. We were playing at the zoo one minute, And he was fine. I don't--please. Okay. All right, noah, does it hurt over here? Ooh. Ah! Ah. It's okay, baby. Okay, page dr. Robbins, stat. (woman) right away, dr. Grey. Hey, um, do you have a minute? I've got a question. Sure. I wanted to talk to you about breast implants. (elevator bell dings) really? Good for you. You know, it crossed my mind the first time I saw you, But I didn'think you were the type to go for it. No. N-not--not for me. For my patient. Oh. Oh. (chuckles) (laughs) of course. Hey. Can I steal him for a quick consult? (sighs) yeah, he's all yours. (groans) Yeah, I was just... (whispering) she's what you're looking for. She's age appropriate, probably wants kids. Yeah. Ask her out. I'm not sure that's gonna work. (normal voice) great. Thanks. As you were. (mark sighs) Teddy, I'm sorry about that. Your breasts are fantastic. I wouldn't change a thg. The patient. Um, he, uh... He's got post-pneumonectomy syndrome, And I wanted to use the implants to stabilize his heart. Of course. Let me take a look. Uh, so asking you out tonight... Probably a bad idea? (laughs) y-you think? What? Mark sloan just asked me out. Huh. Cool. No, no, not "cool." mark sloan.</i> Exactly. Why not have a little fun? I mean, mark is like, uh... Candy. Eat it and forget about it. Right? Come on. You know what? This might be the best idea I've ever had. (elevator bell dings) (beeps) Will you, uh, have to resect a part of the diaphragm? Well, most likely. Or I might let you do the resection. Really? Yep, that or kick you off the case. Depends on how much you've leaked to dr. Hunt. I've been doing this a long time, dr. Yang. You're working for the other side. Now... There is another option... If you would like to realign your allegiances. Like be a double agent? And we could keep looking For more resections for you  perform. So you think about it. Take your time. It's a big tumor. Ymaking headway on my cartilage, But I keep getting 42 intern questions an hour. Can they rotate through your service just for today? Oh, sure. (giggles) Thanks. What is with you? Nothing. Is it the guy? (gasps) (whispers) it's the guy? (normal voice) he brought you coffee? (laughs) no. You think I smile like this for coffee. Uh, he's making me dinner. He's cooking? Wow. You ready? What, for food? Yeah, I think I can handle it. Uh, no, for sex. What? N--grow up. Oh, give me break. How many dates have you had? This'll be three. Oh, yeah. Yeah, third date's the sex date. And he'sooking for you... At his home... Where he keeps his bed. I barely know the man. Well, you're gonna know him a lot better tomorrow. (laughs) there is nothing magic about a third date. It is possible to eat and go home And not lose your pants in the process. Okay. Uh, but if it does go that way, am I supposed to sleep over? Oh, no. No. Sex on the couch. Walk of shame to the car under cover of darkness. Do I wear a dress? Unh-unh. Casual, like--like you don't expect it's gonna happen, But you're ready for it to happen. Oh. How ready? Like... You've prepped the surgical field... The sur-- (gasps) oh, torres. There is a ukrainian woman Who works at the manicure place across the street. Shwi take care of you. You... Mm-hmm. (crinkles paper) Oh! (ultrasound whooshing) (man) you sure it's okay to give him this much medicine When we don't know what's wrong with him? Okay, it's not gonna hurt him. He needed a painkiller, jim. I'm telling you, he needed it. Upper right chest and k.U.B. Are negative. Go get him set up For a c.T. With contrast. Okay. How could this have happened? (whooshing continues) Just say it. You think I missed something. Honey, I don't. I-- yes, you do. Just admit it. Okay, fine. Fine. I mean, how do you miss a fever this high? Guys, this isn't gonna help. Kids get sick. It's no one's fault. (womanyes, it is. It's my fault. Oh, kelly, don't. If you had been with him and this happened, I'd be blaming you. I would kill you if you had him and this happened. Okay. I need to get him in the c.T. I've also added an I.V. Antibiotic because he's septic, And I want to make sure that we've covered everything. Maybe he ate something off the ground? Oh, god. I was watching him! Audrey taylor's latest l.F.T.S Thank you. Dr. Altman. I, uh, set aside some saline implants For your post-pneumonectomy patient. I have a couple on hand. Size-wise, you won't really know what you need Until you're in there. (elevator bell dings) Can you scrub in place them for me? Sure. You know, I was, um... I--well, I-I may actually be free tonight a-after work. Really? Yeah. That's fantastic. There's a new italian restaurant I've been-- I've been meaning to try. Maybe you and I can-- oh, well, joe's is-- is probably fine. For dinner? No.</i> I mean... (laughs) well, I, you know, I... For a-a drink and then--and then-- I was asking you to dinner Sohat we could talk and get to know each other. That sort of thing. Oh, though, that--that's-- that's not-- I mean, I-I thought that... You know... (chuckles) I-I'm not ailable for dinner. I-I--I'm--I'm sorry. Sloan. Sloan. What are you-- what are you doing? Apparently nothing. Teddy... Teddy is not one of these women that you... You--you can't just treat her-- This may come as a shock to you, But it looks like I'm the respectful adult In this particular situation. So how about you talk to her about how she treats people?</i> (elevator bell dings) How genius is this? Mark sloan and teddy. Are you serious? I just said that. Mm. Shut up. Are we so well matched that we have all the same thoughts? It's kinda crazy... (singsongy) but it's kinda great. (laughs) I'm just saying. (laughs) teddy needs someone to come in and clear out the cobwebs And just put a little spring back in her step. Yeah, and father her children. Yeah. W-wait, wait. What? No. Mark? Yeah. He--he wants a wife and kids. (mouth full) well, I told her he was a candy bar. What? (whispers) I didn't know. (grunts) First she said no. Then she said s. Ooh, that's good. And then she said no again, Because she doesn't want to have a meal with me. She just wanted sex. I mean, who treats people like that-- Like an object, a piece of ass? Well, um, I think you do. I've changed. Dr. Sloan, altman says if you're scrubbing in, it's at 2:00. Thanks, karev. You're a good man. (clears throat) (sugarush beat company) Ã¢Â™Âª "l" is love, it's love Ã¢Â™Âª Hey. (lowered voice) not here. Sloan's going all psycho killer on me-- Smiles and crazy eyes. I don't know what the hell he's gonna do. What, I'm still his property? I'll talk to him. Don't, don't. I gotta operate with the guy. You mess with him, he might stab me with a scalpel. (speaking indistinctly) ugh. Mark's trying to kill alex. (mouth full) what? Well, I think I mentioned Sleeping with alex was a bad idea. No, it's not a bad idea. It's happy and easy. You know how much mental energy mark took up? You know, I-I am telling you, ending it Is the best thing that coulda happened to me, and for him. Do you know how much happier he'd be If he could just move on? Looked to  like he was trying to pick up teddy. Mm? Well, sure. Oh, he'll sleep with her. He slept with addison. He'll screw anything that moves. But what, I'm supposed to check into a convent? Why is he hanging on like this? You're just that good, little grey. There's no getting over you. Ã¢Â™Âª "l" is love, it's love Ã¢Â™Âª Oh... You clear the room. Every time, you clear the room. (laughs) Grey, uh, audrey taylor is getting a new set of scans. Could you have a look an see if there's anything We need to include for the presentation? Hey, um, how's the plan coming? Oh, good. I think if I clamp the aorta and the vena cava Above and below the liver and the porta hepatis, I should be able to carve out the tumor. Hmm. Interesting. So, uh, what's the word from the other side? Oh, from dr. Webber? Uh... Not much. He, um... He's still kind of flailing. Fl-flailing, really? Yeah, it's sad. You know, old guy, end of the road. Mm-h. Webber doesn't flail. You know, I'm gonna go and see if I can help him Come up with something. (owen chuckles) Uh-- he flipped her. We have to get those scans before she does. Yeah, let's go. Ah, dr. Bailey. I'm about to do a consult. Would you like to join me? Uh, lunchtime. Yes, but all the years I've known you, I've never seen you eat. I do things at lunchtime. What things? Errands--to the dentist, to get a haircut--no, not a haircut. I'm going out. Does that require an interrogation? Is that the kind of chief you want to be? Is that the kind of man you want to be? No. I didn't think so. Take a deep breath. (inhales and exhales deeply) Hey, doc, my parents got married really young, And they freakin' hated each other By the time I was born. Sorry to hear that. Molly thinks shacking up's all cute, But I don't think you play around with something like that. You know, people can get hurt. You really don't need to explain. You think I'm a turd, And you're getting ready to slice me open with a knife. (sighs) I'm sure you're not a turd. I think we found our problem. Noah had a cyst on his liver, and it ruptured, And that's what's causing so much pain. A cyst? Why would he have a cyst? (lexie) they can be congenital or infectious. They're usually benign, but they can rupture with pressure. Pressure? What kind of pressure? You mean like a fall? Did-- did noah take a fall today? No. Okay, the truth is, it doesn't matter what caused the rupture. What matters is that we operate right away. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. We were doing bear hugs. We were--I-I hugged him. I hugged him hard. That's when-- that's what did this? (monitor beeping erratically) (jim) noah? Noah? What's happening? (kelly) no! (jim) noah. Grey, get an o.R. We're going now. (cries) I've done this 300 times, and it's still not working. I went to eugenia. Mm. She held up two postage stamps And ked me if was looking for the 44-cent or the 3. Um, you don't have to tell me which one you picked. I left! Look... Look, let me tell you a little something About my surgical field. Okay? I prep my surgical field with soap and water. I keep my surgical field the way god made it. Okay? I don't need a member of the ukrainian k.G.B. Waxing it smooth so that it can be mistaken For the surgical field of a 5-year-old girl. I am a woman, and a woman Was meant to have something on her surgical field.</i> If a man can't deal with a little something On the surgical field, A little nature, a little god, Then that man has no business getting near my surgical field. Fine. I'm not putting a gun to your head. Let freedom ring. Damn it. This is not supposed to be liquid. (sighs) (exhales) (voice breaking) what if I'm not cut out for this? You know, what if I'm no longer... Patient enough Or stupid enough to deal with this crap? Come here. Come here. (whimpers) Come here. (chuckles) You can do this. You can do this. You can. (chuckles)</i> This cyst was massive. We're gonna have to do a chole 'cause of the intrabiliary pressure. Should I update his parents? It's gonna take a lot longer than we said. Uh, yeah, sure. That's a good idea. What do I tell them? Doesn't matter. I'm sorry? Until you can say he's awake and he's fine, They won't hear a word. They'll just hear white noise and see your mouth moving. But go. It's good for them to see you. Try to keep your face happy. (suction gurgles) Jackson avery. Put him on our team. Hey, are you stacking the deck again? You're a spy. Don't think that I don't know it. And who started that boulder rolling down the hill? Okay, okay, okay. I'm switzerland in this moment. All I'm saying is that whoever gets the surgery should use him. Use me for what? He's a liability. Avery is not gonna give the award to his own grandson. Unh-unh. I don't think-- He won't be named a contributor. It'll just get mentioned over thanksgiving... No. No, I won't. That he worked on a tumor the size of a possum. What's going on? They're fighting over me. Or more the idea of me. I don't really think that-- he's harper avery bait. (meredith) derek's waiting for us. Okay, the heart is back where it came from. Dr. Sloan? (mark) two c's. You're just gonna eyeball it? This is what I do. If you say so. Syringe. Whoa. What, are you afraid I'm gonna stab you? No needle. (monitor beeping erratically) he's hypotensive. Your implants are sitting on the vena cava. There's too much fluid. No, there's not. Just need to reposition it. Relax. Thank you. An abdominal entry is a shot in the dark. The tumor has shoved everything out of place. The anatomy's a mess. Now I'm proposing a thoracoabdominalpproach. You want to go in through the chest? It's risky, yes, but not as risky As "I'll open up the abdomen and take a good look around." snap. You may end up seeding the tumor in the lungs. That is a danger, yes. Impressive proposal. It's very... Hmm. I think I feel more comfortable with dr. Hunt's plan. He doesn't have a plan. He has an attitude. It's more improvisational. But given our situation, I think it's our best bet. Thanks, all of you. (owen) thank you. (door opens) (blows air) (door closes) Richard, uh... I'm sorry. It was a good plan. Hunt's just makes more sense to me. Yes, because that's the way you'd do it. That's your style. Let me tell you about your new job. You manage surgeons. Your job is to help them do what they do</i> The way they do it. Not to get them to do what you would do.</i> It takes vision, derek. And you don't have it. (monitor beeping erratically) (alex) b.P.'s still low. Dr. Sloan. When people rush you, does it usually help? No, but it would be nice if we didn't let him die. I feel the same way. And you thought we had nothing in common. (monitor beeping rhythmically) pressure's coming back up. Imagine. (teddy) dr. Sloan. Nice work. What, that? Just a hobby. Professionally, I'm more focused on my work As a male escort. (door opens and closes) We will isolate the tumor from the blood vessels That supply it, And then try to extract it. That's the plan? You'll try? Is that a plan? I wish that I could be more specific, but, uh... Until we know what we're dealing with-- No, no, no. That's not a plan. That's a death sentence. Audrey mrs. Taylor, if this works, it is not just a month. It is a long time. It's a gamble. It's a huge one. You are gambling away my daughter's wedding. Well, then, you know what? I'll call kim right now, And she'll get a justice of the peace, And she and scott could get married right here in this room, And then we could stop bothering these men. Don-- You know, you-ou don't even like weddings. The salmon will be too dry and the flowers Will make you sneeze, and kim will be angry at you Because women get angry at their mothers at their weddings Because that's how they handle their stress. Stop it. Do you think that she cares about her wedding? Her mother is dying. Don. They're trying to offer you a life--a whole, long life. And, no, they can't guarantee it, And they're not gonna know what they're gonna find, And it's a gamble. But how can you not take that chance, because of a wedding? There'll be grandkids and--and arguments And god knows what else, and she'll need you for those. And I'll need you. (cries) Your husband's right. And so is dr. Hunt. He can't foresee what he'll find in surgery. But he'll solve that as it comes. That's the plan. And it's a good one. He did great. Oh. Oh. He's just coming out from under anesthesia. And he's probably gonna be in a little pain from the surgery, But... He's gonna be fine. Is this gonna happen again? It's possible that he'll develop a cyst iv the future, So you're gonna have to keep an eye out. This was... I hugged himdo I not hug him? Do we not wrestle? You don't throw him on the ground. Well, he's a boy. He likes to wrestle. It's not like I initiate it. Of course you hug him. And you wrestle. You live your lives. And if he happens to be in any great pain, Then you know what-- so there isn't any kind of preventative thing that-- Please let her finish. It's okay. I was done. (sighs) Are you ready to see him? Yeah. Hmm. Somebody paged me here. Shh. Condoms. I'm building cartilage... From jell-o, And you paged me for-- Condoms. (whispers) they have them in the clinic. No, no. Am I supposed to bring them? Oh. (laughs) oh, miranda. (whimpers) (normal voice) yeah, yh. Um... Guy brings the condoms. Okay. Anyhow, I would've pegged you for the diaphragm type. Well, I have a diaphragm. Diaphragms prevent pregnancies. They don't protect against The raft of sexually transmitted diseases. You're a physician. Am I really explaining this to you? I got it. I got it. Okay. You know what? Look, guy brings the condoms, But sometimes they fail to provide them on the third date As a sign of respect. "oh, I never imagined this would happen so soon. Oh, I wasn't prepared." so you know what? You should bring 'em. Always bring 'em. Why trust the guy, right? Right. Right. All right. All right. Torres. Hmm? (mutters) Come on. I can't. I-- you can. Walk into the clinic and take some condoms out of the box. Don't make me ask you twice. I'm having trouble telling liver from tumor. Yep, you and me both. (owen) clamp. (richard) sorry you didn't end up On the winning team, yang. Oh, sucks. You made a ballsy play, though. Thoracoabdominal entry? Well, I do what I can to keep it fresh. Bring in the cusa. Hang another unit of f.F.P.</i> (jackson) need more laps. More, more.</i> (monitor beeping rhymically) Hey, you guys need some help? (owen) where's webber?</i> You want me to scrub in? I need webber. Where's webber?</i> I just helped altman save her patient. I don't know why I bothered. She thinks I'm a piece of meat. Look, there's plenty of women dying to settle down. You just gotta move on to the next one. Uh, try, uh, what's her name in, uh, derm? Dinner and a conversation. Can't wait. Who said dinner? Lunch. No, lunch is not romantic. Well, you don't want romantic. You want daylight and public So you can, you know, get to know each other. That is the least sexy thing I've ever heard in my life. You've had sex. You don't want sex. You want a baby. No, there's no way this works. God, is it really possible that you're this insecure? You're not just a sex machine, mark. I mean, look, don't get me wrong. You've got skills. But you're a good person. Why do you think Little miss muffet fell for you? Lexie left. Well, because she was too young. It was about her, not you. (sighs) wow. You really don't believe any of this, do you? Okay. Listen... (sighs) You're a good guy. You're worth getting to know... Hispers) in daylight. This is not gonna work, dr. Hunt. The chest isn't an option anymore, richard. This is what we've got. I'm not pitching my solution. I'm saying we should think a minute. Okay, I've isolated the blood supply And mobilized the liver, but I can't get enough exposure To get to the tumor. What if we lift the liver up and give you more visibility? Well, that would help with the periphery, But I can't--I still have to deal with the vessels. I wish we could take-- just take the damn thing out. Well, why not? Let's take the liver out. I can clean off the tumor ex vivo. You can work on the vascular supply in the cavity. Will it work? No one's ever tried that before. She's crashing. If you're trying something, now is the time. Hunt. (monitor beeping erratically) Okay, extracting the liver. Okay, let's go. Okay, more laps. Suction. A lot of suction. Hurry. (beeping continues) The surgery went great. Everything is back where it should be. And todd's gonna be fine. Oh, my god. Thank you. Do you think I should go see him? Well, he's still a bit groggy. I mean, do you think he wants to see me After I stormed out? How did he seem? Did he seem upset or... I just... I love him. And I was a little crazy. I mean, he practically had a heart attack or whatever, And I-I acted a little crazy. When you feel like you love someone More than he loves you, That can make you a little crazy. It can make you a lot crazy. You know, webber really came up with the idea To take out the liver. Maybe if owen, uh, agreed to take his name off of it. Will you give it up? Hunt was more than halfway done By the time the idea even surfaced. There's no harper avery. Waste. No, it's not a waste. It's exactly what my grandfather had in mind When he came up with the stupid thing-- Find some way to keep surgeons motivated, Make them take it to the next level Even if they're already at the top of their game. And that's exactly what it did today. This message was brought to you By the harper avery foundation of america. (laughs) Donations to the foundation can be made at www.Nepotism-- you're kind of a bitch. You know that? What? It was inspiring. Mrs. Taylor's gonna need a post-op note. I'll do it. (laughs) Good work today, grey. We're a good team. You know, we're not a team. Cristina and I are a team. I watched you today... Watch teddy and mark. I was... (exhales) she's my friend, And mark sloan is a public health hazard. You were jealous. It took a long time to make her happy. And she's finally happy. And if you mess with that, I will turn on you. That's a team. Ã¢Â™Âª (woman) Ã¢Â™Âª she was from kansas Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª worked in a dairy Ã¢Â™Âª Maybe you should, uh, Leave this to the bioengineers. Mm, tried it. They said it won't work. Well, maybe that's 'cause it won't work. No, they're just not invested in it like I am. Hmm. Holy... It... It's not liquid. Arizona, it's not liquid! Oh, my god. Oh, god. Oh, my god. Do you know what you did? I, uh, I don't know. I don't know. I gotta--I gotta-- I gotta do it again. (laughs) I'm on fire. And it's not just this. It's... Everyone came to me for relationship advice today. And I gave them sane and healthy advice. I mean, whether they take it or not, I am seen as someone sane and healthy enough To give advice. I mean, when I lived in the basement, When I--when I married an intern in vegas, I-I wasn't seen that way. (laughs) You're amazing. We're amazing. (laughs) I mean, we're the stable couple now. We're the one everyone wants to be. (laughs) I mean, I could just see us ten years from now In a big old house with kids running around And giving sage, sane advice to mark sloan, Who will still be single. (laughs) (laughs) well, I'm in it for all but the kids. What? Mm. No kids. And by no, I mean, "yikes."</i> No to the kids. (laughs) you're joking, right? I mean, you're in pediatrics. Yeah. Exactly. I mean, this kid noah comes in today. And he's fine one minute, then his mom gives him a hug, And he lands in my o.R. Nearly dead. But you saved him. Yeah, but his parents? They're-- they're--they're a hot mess. I mean, they'll never sleep well again. Mnh-mnh. But the big house? Mm. I'm in. Ooh, and can we have dogs and chickens? I have this weird thing for chickens. Ã¢Â™Âª good-bye, good-bye Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª and tomorrow's tomorrow Ã¢Â™Âª (speaks indistinctly) (keypad beeping) Ã¢Â™Âª I will call out for you Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª and tonight, tonight Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª I will have to say good-bye, good-bye Ã¢Â™Âª I'd love to have dinner sometime, If--if--if you're still up for it. Ã¢Â™Âª tomorrow, tomorrow Ã¢Â™Âª I'm not taking you to dinner. Oh. I will take you to lunch... Saturday afternoon, in broad daylight. We'll eat at a public place, Then maybe take a walk on a crowded street. We'll get to know each other. See if we have an interest in the same kind of future, Because... I want to build a life... And a family. And I'm not wasting my time On someone who doesn't share that interest. Ã¢Â™Âª your smile and laugh Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª and words like... Ã¢Â™Âª I'll pick you up at noon. Ã¢Â™Âª ...Home Ã¢Â™Âª Okay, then. You know, I used to grill. You're out in the air. You got your slab of beef. It's a very masculine activity. But you ever try to grill in seattle? I haven't. You stand around in the rain in a raincoat with the hood up. And let me tell you, there is nothing manly about a hood And a soggy slab of beef. Uh, okay. Look, here's the thing-- I don't do things because there's a timeline. I don't do things because it's the third anything. I may have been out of the dating game for a while, But I don't play By anyone's rules other than my own. So whatever expectations You walked into this evening with-- Are--are you lecturing me? No. I-- no, you are. (laughs) You lecturpeople. I think because most people are scared of you, So nobody's willing to interrupt you Once you get on a roll, but, uh, I'm not scared of you. So the lecture thing is not gonna work. We're gonna have to have a conversation. (melody gardot) Ã¢Â™Âª I need a hand Ã¢Â™Âª</i> Don't worry. Just ask me a question, And then I'll answer it, and then you get another turn. Go ahead. Ã¢Â™Âª Are you under the impression That we're going to have sex tonight? Because if that's the case, I-- Ask the question. Don't answer the question. I'll answer the question. (sighs) And, uh, no, I'm not assuming that we'll have sex tonight. You're a grown woman. Neither of us, I believe, is looking for something trashy. So I kinda thought, third date was a little early. What do you think? Me, too. I... Can I make a statement or just questions? A statement is fine. I... Ã¢Â™Âª ...From my troubling ways Ã¢Â™Âª Uh, have never had sex with anyone other than my husband-- Former husband. Ã¢Â™Âª I need a break Ã¢Â™Âª So it's not something you get into lightly. No. Neither do I. What else? Ã¢Â™Âª When do you think is the right time? I don't know. I like to think we'll know it when we see it. Probably somewhere between date 8 and date 12, though. Oh, no concern we'll end up just friends? That what you're looking for? No. Me neither. Look, um... (sets glass down) I don't want to be your friend. I have enough friends. Ã¢Â™Âª They take pictures of mountain climbers</i> At the top of the mountain. They're smiling... Ecstatic... Triumphant. Ã¢Â™Âª Ah, richard. I understand your patient's doing well. Hunt's patient. He says he couldn't have done it without you. I'm sorry I didn't-- Ah, don't. You're doing your job. It isn't easy. True. I'm not necessarily all that good at it yet though. , you're not. (laughs) really? You couldn't give me one kind word? Not one? They don't take pictures along the way,</i> 'cause who wants to remember the rest of it?</i> We push ourselves because we have to,</i> Not because we like it. Hey. How was mark? Did he do anything? Oh, he was totally cool. I think he's io altman now. Teddy? Oh, come on. He's just trying to make me think that he's moving on. Well, it looked real.  He w. He's all, like, "let's take it slow And get to know each other." I think she went for it. Ã¢Â™Âª Hey. Ã¢Â™Âª You okay? Yeah. Mark's moving on. Like... Really. Okay. Well, that's good, isn't it? Isn't that what you wanted? (voice breaking) no. It's--it's--it's--it's great. It's--that's, um, that's perct. It's... It's per--it's perfect. (crying) The relentless climb... (sobs) The pain and anguish of taking it to the next level...</i> (sobbing) Nobody takes pictures of that. (sobbing continu) Nobody wants to remember. We just want to remember the view from the top...</i> The breathtaking moment at the edge of the world.</i> That's what keeps up climbing. And it's worth the pain.
