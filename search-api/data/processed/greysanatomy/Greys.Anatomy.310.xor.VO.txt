YANG-- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TOTO THEM,</i> THEIR PUNISHMENT? DR. BAILEY-- THERE'S A NEED FOR JUSTICE HERE. JUSTICE? JUSTICE HAS NO DEFINITION WITHIN THE FOUR WALLS OF A HOSPITAL, DR. BAILEY.

YOUR MAGAZINES? GET 'EM OUTTA THERE SO YOUR MA DOESN'T SEE THEM. YOUR MAGAZINES? (clears throat) GOOD MORNING, MR. O'MALLEY. JUST WANTED TO STOP BY BEFORE THE SURGERY AND SEE HOW THAT COLLARBONE WAS HEALING. GEORGE... YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY HELLO TO DR. TORRES? I'M GONNA SEE YOU FOR ROUNDS, DAD. HAD YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE DEVELOPING A TREMOR, I COULD'VE RUN SOME TESTS. THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT THERE'S JUST SOME COMPRESSION OF THE STRUCTURES AROUND THE INJURY. I CAN GO IN THERE-- I DON'T WANT ANOTHER SURGERY. IT COULD BE A SMALL CLOT. I JUST GO IN-- SHEPHERD, I DON'T WANT ANOTHER SURGERY. THE FIRST ONE CAUSED ENOUGH DAMAGE. I CAN DO THIS. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID THE LAST TIME. NOW I HAVE A TREMOR. MAYBE SHE'LL BE ON "LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH" PATROL, TOO. AT LEAST I'D HAVE SOME COMPANY. WHATEVER SHE GETS, I HOPE IT'S BAD, REALLY BAD. SHE MADE A MISTAKE. A MISTAKE? WE ALL-- SHE WAS GONNA LET BURKE-- BURKE WITH THE SHAKY HAND-- OPERATE ON MY FATHER. COULD YOU STOP LKING AT ME LIKE THAT? IT'S CREEPY, AND IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FED. HOW'S IT GOING? HOW'S WHAT GOING? YOU AND BURKE, ARE YOU OKAY? (exhales) WE'RE EXISTING IN TOTAL SILENCE. HE'S NOT TALKING TO YOU?

OKAY, BUT TECHNICALLY, SHE IS, YOU HAVE THE SAME FATHER. AND, UH, SUSAN-- SUSAN GREY IS DEFINITELY NOT MY MOTHER. I APPRECIATE YOUE TRYING TO BE NICE AND EVERYTHING, BUT I REALLY DON'T EVEN NEED TO KNOW THIS, SO-- ACTUALLY YOU DO. (clears throat) HELLO, MEREDITH. HI, MOM. HONEY. OH.

I HAVEN'T HAD A CARDIAC CASE IN AGES. IT'S MY FATHER. IT'S NOT A CASE. I GUESS THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD NOW. (Izzie) YANG DOES SOMETHING WRONG, AND SHE GETS REWARDED. THAT'S FAIR. YEAH. IF YOU THUMB SUCKERS DON'T STOP WHINING, I SWEAR I WON'T SHOW YOU WHAT'S BEHIND THIS DOOR, AND TRUST ME, YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT'S BEHIND THIS DOOR. EXCUSE ME, DOCTORS, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES. HE'S GOTTA PEE. EVERY FIVE MINUTES, HE'S GOTTA PEE. A SMALL BLADDER. I'VE ALWAYS HAD I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS ANY LONGER. YOU? I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO PUT UP WITH YOUR WHINING. LIKE THE WHINING YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW? NOW WHICH ONE OF YOU THINKS THAT YANG GOT THE BETTER CASE? THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. JAKE AND PETER WEITZMAN, 35-YEAR-OLD PYGOPAGUS CONJOINED TWINS ATTACHED AT THE LUMBOSACRAL JUNCTION. BUT NOT FOR LONG, RIGHT, DR. WEBBER? THE WEITZMANS CAME ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO FOR A SEPARATION PROCEDURE. THEY OPTED OUT BECAUSE OF THE RISK. PETE CHICKENED OUT. WELL, FORGIVE ME FOR WANTING TO LIVE LONGER, EVEN IF IT MEANT LIVING WITH YOU. YEAH? WELL, YOU WASTED SIX MONTHS OF OUR LIVES... OH, COME ON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. STOP IT. YOU GUYS CAME BACK AT THE RIGHT TIME. WE JUST SCORED NEW YORK'S TOP PLASTIC SURGEON. (Richard) MARK SLOAN, PLASTICS, AND YOU REMEMBER DR. SHEPHERD, YOUR NEUROSURGEON. (Derek) JAKE.

JAKE, PETE, UM, WHY-- DO YOU MIND ME ASKING WHY NOW WHEN YOU THOUGHT THE PROCEDURE WAS TOO RISKY SIX MONTHS AGO? WELL-- GUYS. WHOA. THAT'S A LOT OF DOCTORS. I'M--I'M JUST GONNA COME BACK LATER. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. ELENA, COME IN, COME IN. YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHY NOW. THIS IS WHY-- THE LOVE OF MY LIFE-- ELENA. JAKE, DON'T--I-I TOLD HIM NOT TO DO THIS, NOT FOR ME ANYWAY, 'CAUSE THAT'S JUST CRAZY. 'CAUSE PETE SAID THAT THEY COULD END UP PARALYZED. THEY COULD END UP DEAD. WHAT DO YOU TELL HER THINGS LIKE THAT FOR? I WASN'T TELLING HER. I WAS TELLING YOU.</i> SHE JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE ONLY ONE WHO LISTENS TO ME. SHE HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE TO BE STUCK TO THE SAME PERSON-- HERE WE GO. EVERY--THAT'S RIGHT. HERE WE GO. HERE WE-- DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE TO BE WITH THE SAME PERSON EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY, TO NOT HAVE ANYTHING THAT'S JUST YOURS, NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ON YOUR OWN? WELL, NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE LIKE THAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK, PETE? I THINK, WHY WOULD I WANT TO BE ATTACHED TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE ATTACHED TO ME? (Alex) I'M CALLING IT. IT'S MINE. I HAVE TWO BROTHERS. I FEEL THEIR PAIN. I WOULD BE GREAT AT WATCHING THIS. ZIP IT, ALL OF YOU. WE'RE ON THE CASE, RIGHT? RIGHT. YES! AWESOME. STEVENS, YOU ARE TO-- LOOK AND NOT TOUCH OR SPEAK OR BREATHE. I GOT IT. SO THIS IS THE CRACK TEAM, HUH? FEEL FREE TO TAKE ONE. HOW ABOUT I TAKE THE ONE THAT DOESN'T TOUCH OR SPEAK OR BREATHE? (whispers) RIGHT. DAMN IT. THANK YOU... FOR PICKING ME. EVEN JUST OBSERVING WOULD BE-- THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE FUN TO LOOK AT WHILE I WORK. WILL YOU BE WORKING ON BOTH THE NERVE GRAFT AND THE SKIN RECONSTRUCTION? YES, AND I THINK I'LL HANDLE THEM A WHOLE LOT BETTER WITH A LITTLE CAFFEINE IN MY SYSTEM. GET ME A BLUEBERRY SCONE, A BONE DRY CAPPUCCINO AND A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF. THERE'S A CAFETERIA ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND A COFFEE CART IN THE LOBBY. FEISTY. CAPPUCCINO. YOU CAN KICK ME BACK TO BAILEY IF YOU WANT. I DON'T DO COFFEE. SO HOW WILL YOU BE HANDLING THE NERVE GRAFT AND THE SKIN RECONSTRUCTION? CONJOINED TWINS, DEREK. (Derek) I KNOW, CHIEF. CONJOINED ADULT TWINS. MM-HMM. I MEAN, IT'S RARE ENOUGH TO SEPARATE CONJOINED INFANTS. BUT CONJOINED ADULTS? MM-HMM. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PRESS, WHAT A SURGERY LIKE THIS COULD DO FOR THIS HOSPITAL? I KNOW, WHICH IS WHY I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO IT. THEIR SPINES ARE FUSED TOGETHER FROM THE L4 DOWN. THEIR BLOOD FLOW IS INTRICATELY CONNECTED. THEY COULD END UP PARALYZED, OR EVEN DEAD. YOUR PATIENTS WANT THIS OPERATION, DEREK. WHY ARE YOU BACKING OUT? THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU. UNLESS THERE'S INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE THAT THIS SURGERY CAN'T BE DONE, WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. YOUR FATHER'S NOT HERE. THATCHER'S AT HARVARD MED VISITING LEXIE. WE THOUGHT WE HAD A LOT OF TIME. I MEAN, MOLLY'S ONLY 36 WEEKS, AND DR. MONTGOMERY'S BEEN TRYING TO STOP THE CONTRACTIONS, BUT I GUESS THE BABY IS READY TO COME OUT. WELL, DO YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE OR... YEAH, ACTUALLY, I COULD USE AN INTERN FOR THIS. CAN YOU ASK DR. BAILEY FOR SOMEONE? UH... I'LL DO IT. ARE YOU SURE? YEAH, I'M FINE. OKAY. IT'LL BE SO NICE TO HAVE A FAMILIAR FACE IN THE OPERATING ROOM. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IT'S MY JOB TO BE HERE, SO... UH, DOES MOLLY KNOW WHO I AM? SHE DOESN'T. I WANTED TO TELL HER, BUT YOUR FATHER... HE JUST--HE-- NO, IT'S--IT'S BETTER. IT'S BETTER THAT SHE NOT KNOW. IT'S GOOD. SO I THINK, UH, MOLLY SHOULD BE READY IN THE O.R. SUSAN, YOU'LL NEED SCRUBS AND A CAP. I'M ABOUT TO BE A GRANDMOTHER. YES, IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR, YOU WILL BE A GRANDMOTHER. OH, MY. OKAY. HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. WE'RE GOING TO BE REPLACING YOUR AORTIC VALVE WITH A PORCINE VALVE. WELL, GEORGIE SAYS IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. HE SAYS THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. BESIDES, IF YOU DIE, I'LL KILL YOU. WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING WE'RE DOING THIS TODAY. WE NOTICED YOU HAD A LOT OF IRREGULAR HEART RHYTHMS THIS MORNING. DID YOU CHECK HIS DIG LEVEL? EXCUSE ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THIS MORNING HIS POTASSIUM WAS A BORDERLINE LOW. ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT A HANDLE ON THINGS HERE. OH, I'M SURE YOU DO. UH, GEORGE, I THINK MAYBE YOU SHOULD STEP OUTSIDE. LIKE THAT. YOU DON'T TALK TO ME OH, SHE'S WAKING UP THE BABY. RONNY, SHUT UP. BE CAREFUL, DR. HAHN, HE MIGHT START CRYING. I SAID SHUT UP. ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE OUT OF HERE.</i> NO, I'M NOT. GEORGIE. NO, UH, SHE CAN'T KICK ME OUT. SHE HAS NO RIGHT. I HIREHEHER. I'M STAYING. (Addison) HOW YOU DOING THERE, MOLLY? OKAY. I'M JUST EXCITED TO SEE MY GIRL. WELL, YOU'RE GONNA GET TO TAKE A LOOK AT HER IN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES. A LITTLE MORE TRACTION, PLEASE? DR. GREY, CAN YOU GIVE ME (woman) VITALS ARE HOLDING STEADY. CAN YOU SEE HER YET? (chuckles) NO. I'M NOT GONNA LOOK UNTIL THE BLOOD'S ALL GONE. OKAY. YOU WANT TO CUT THE CORD, DR. GREY? @@ (woman) THE WARMER IS READY WHEN YOU NEED IT, DR. MONTGOMERY. DR. GREY, WILL YOU FOLLOW ME? DR. KNOX, WILL YOU CLOSE FOR ME, PLEASE? BAG VALVE MASK. WE HAVE TO STABILIZE THIS BABY AND GET IT INTO SURGERY. (woman) GET HER ON THE MONITOR. THE PULSE IS WEAK. WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER? SUSAN, I NEED YOU TO STAND BACK AND STAY WITH MOLLY, PLEASE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER? (woman) NO RESPONSE TO STIMULATION. LET'S TRY SUCTION. (Addison) GREY, YOU WANT TO TALK HER THROUGH THIS? GR, I NEED YOUR HELP HERE. THE BABY IS NOT BREATHING. (Molly) WHAT? WHAT DID SHE SAY? YOU LEFT ME HANGING IN THERE, GREY. I'M SORRY. I WAS... I'M SORRY. DO YOU NEED ME TO SCRUB IN ON THE BABY? NO. I WANT YOU TO KEEP MOLLY AND HER MOTHER APPRISED OF THE BABY'S CONDITION WHILE I OPERATE. I'M SURE THEY'D RATHER TALK TO YOU. THE BABY'S GOT JEJUNAL ATRESIA. SHE MAY DIE. I GOT CONSENT, BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR UPDATES. I THINK I WOULD REALLY LEARN A LOT FROM OBSERVING THIS PROCEDURE. NO, IT WAS A MISTAKE TO LET YOU IN THE O.R. WITH YOUR FILY IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN. CHECK IN WITH ME EVERY HOUR. HOW MANY VALVE REPLACEMENTS HAVE YOU PERFORMED @@ IN YOUR LIFE, DR. O'MALLEY? NONE. NONE. AND HOW MANY VALVE REPLACEMENTS DO YOU THINK DR. HAHN HAS PERFORMED? THAT IS MY FATHER! AND YOU ARE IN THAT ROOM AS HIS SON. YOU INTERNS THINK YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO. WELL, NOT ANYMORE, NOT WITH ME, WHICH IS WHY YOU ARE GOING TO STAY AWAY, 50 FEET AWAY TO BE PRECISE. YOU ARE GOING TO REMAIN 50 FEET AWAY FROM YOUR FATHER AT ALL TIMES TODAY, AND, DR. O'MALLEY, DO NOT MAKE ME TELL YOU AGAIN. EVERYTHING OKAY WITH THE O'MALLEYS? THE KID'S A PAIN IN THE ASS. BUT DR. YANG HERE IS PROVING TO BE AN EXTREMELY CAPABLE ASSET. I HEAR SHE STUDIED UNDER YOU. YOU TRAINED HER WELL. YES. WELL, SHE'S VERY... PROFESSIONAL. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT DR. LEVINE? PRETTY GOOD. BETTER OR WORSE THAN DR. KORSIKOV? ITIT... WHY ARE YOU RESEARCHING NEUROSURGEONS WHEN YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT DEREK'S BETTER THAN ANYBODY? I DON'T WANT SHEPHERD. YOU BLAMING THIS ON HIM? YOU KNOW,  UNTIL NOW, I HAVE NOT YELLED. I HAVE NOT YELLED BECAUSE YOU WERE A GUY IN TROUBLE, AND I WAS SUPPORTING YOU. BUT NOW... I AM YELLING! CHIEF. I AM YELLING VERY LOUDLY! I WANT TO RETIRE, BURKE! I WANT MY WIFE BACK! AND I PASSED THE TORCH TO YOU! I PASSED THE TORCH TO YOU, AND YOU BLEW IT OUT! LOOK, I KNOW I LET YOU DOWN. I'M TIRED. I'M TIRED OF YOU MEN ACTING LIKE BOYS. YOU LET ME DOWN. AND IF YOU DON'T LET DEREK FIX THAT HAND, YOU'RE LETTING YOURSELF DOWN. 22 SURGEONS-- IT TAKES 22 SURGEONS TO DO THIS. SO WHERE ARE WE? I'VE GOTTEN TO THE CAUDA EQUINA. I'LL BE WORKING ON THE MUSCULATURE OF THE PERINEAL FLOOR. I'LL BE HARVESTING THE SURAL NERVE FOR TRANSFER. NOW ONCE I RESECT THIS ARTERY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE LESS THAN TWO MINUTES BEFORE ALL SENSATION TO THESE NERVES ARE GONE. I'I'M PRETTY SURE WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH NERVE TO TRANSFER AND COVER THE DEFICITS. WE CAN DEFINITELY DO THIS. OH, DAMN IT. IT'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE FRAGILE IN THE BODY. IT'S ONE THING IF THIS IS A LIFE-OR-DEH SITUATION AND THIS IS ALL WE CAN DO TO SAVE THEM. BUT THESE GUYS ARE FINE. THIS ISN'T WORTH THE RISK. HOW IS OUR BABY? SHE HAS AN INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, WHICH IS WHY SHE COULDN'T BREATHE. DR. MONTGOMERY IS OPERATING ON HER RIGHT NOW. I CAN'T DO THIS. I CAN'T DO IT. YES, YOU CAN. YES, YOU CAN. I AM RIGHT HERE, BABY, AND DAD'S ON THE WAY. I HAVE TO CALL ERIC. OKAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL HIM. THAT'S HER HUSBAND. HE'S IN IRAQ. I CAN'T TELL HIM THIS. HE'S GONNA WANT TO NAME HER, AND I DON'T WANNA NAME HER 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG SHE'S GONNA BE OURS. OH, NOW--SHH. WE'LL CALL HIM TOGETHER. OKAY. @@ HE'S JUST GONNA BE HAPPY TO HEAR YOUR VOICE. THE BABY'S GONNA BE OKAY. YOU HEAR ME? I THOUGHT YOU WERE SLOAN'S RIGHT HAND. YEAH, WELL, SLOAN CAN KISS MY-- OW I HAVEN'T EVEN PUT THE NEEDLE IN YET. SORRY. I'M JUST NOT A BIG FAN OF PAIN. WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE AND PAINFUL SURGERY. YOU THINK THIS IS AN ELECTIVE PROCEDURE? (laughs) THAT WE'RE JUST COMING IN HERE BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING ON EACH OTHER'S NERVES? PLEASE, YOU WANT TO KNOW THE REAL REASON? COME ON, JAKE. SHE DOESN'T WANT-- IT'S BECAUSE-- YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR-- IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE RULES. RULES? YEAH, LIKE SAY ONE OF US IS ON A DINNER DATE, ACCORDING TO THE RULES, THE OTHER ONE'S SUPPOSED TO SIT THERE QUIETLY, EAT HIS FALAFE AND SHUT THE HELL UP. I TRY. IT'S JUST THE WAY YOU TALK TO HER SOMETIMES-- 'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. HOW IS IT NONE OF MY BUSINS? HE STICKS UP FOR ME, AND I THINK THAT THAT'S KINDA NICE. OKAY, YOU DON'T TALK TO HIM ANYMORE. WHAT? OH, WE CAN'T EVEN BE FRIENDS NOW? WE HAVE OTHER RULES, TOO. OH. LIKE FOR WHEN WE'RE WITH SOMEONE.</i> GOT IT. SORT OF. NO LOOKING, NO TALKING, NO TOUCHING. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. BADLY.

AND AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM, STAT. LET'S MOVE IT, PEOPLE. THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. WE GOTTA GET CONTROL OF THIS BLEEDING. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET HIM BACK ON BYPASS. I COULD PUT THE AORTIC CANNULA INTO HIS RIGHT ATRIUM. BY YOURSELF? YES. ALL RIGHT, DO IT. REPLACE IT WITH A 2-STAGE VENOUS CANNULA. WHY IS SHE DOING THAT? WH-WHY IS HAHN LETTING HER DO THAT? NO, IT'S OKAY. SHE'S DOING A RUNNING WHIP STITCH. SHE'S DONE IT BEFORE. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL WORK, DR. YANG. DR. HAHN'S WORK WAS IMPECCABLE, O'MALLEY. I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENT MYSELF. IT'S JUST, UH... YOU CAN NEVER TELL HOW THE BODY IS GOING TO RESPOND. EVERY SURGERY... EVERY BODY IS DIFFERENT. YOU JUST... NEVER KNOW. BUT IT'S OKAY NOW. THEY'RE IN THE HOME STRETCH. THANK YOU, DR. BURKE. (Miranda) IT UNDERMINES EVERYTHING FOR MY INTERNS TO SEE YANG GO WITHOUT PUNISHMENT, FOR ME TO SEE BURKE GO WITHOUT PUNISHMENT. TAKE A STEP BACK. TRY AND GET SOME PERSPECTIVE. SO THERE WILL BE NO CONSEQUENCES, FOR EITHER OF THEM. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO, FIRE THE BOTH OF THEM, END THEIR CAREERS? THEY MADE A TERRIBLE JUDGMENT CALL. WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH DENNY DUQUETTE. AND THEY DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY. AND I DID. YOU DIDN'T KILL DUQUETTE, AND I WON'T HAVE YOU SAYING YOU DID. I WAS RESPONSIBLEFOR IZZIE STEVENS. I WAS RESPONSIBLE. AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR CRISTINA YANG. I... AM THE COMMON THREAD HERE. I... LOST THEM. CRISTINA, IZZIE-- ARE NOT THE SAME. MIRANDA... YOU RAISE THEM... YOU RAISE THEM LIKE... LIKE CHILDREN... AND SOME OF THEM MAKE MISTAKES AND SOME OF THEM DISAPPOINT YOU. SOME OF THEM... DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF STRENGTH IT MUST HAVE TAKEN YANG TO COME TO ME, TO REPORT ON AN ATTENDING, ON HER BOYFRIEND? DO YOU SEE HOW MUCH SHE'S GROWN? YOU RAISE THEM... LIKE CHILDREN... AND SOME OF THEM TURN OUT EXACTLY LIKE YOU, DR. BAILEY. WE'RE FINALLY ALONE. (chuckles) YEAH. PETE? IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, AND, UH, I'LL, UM, COME BACK IN THE MORNING. (Meredith) AT THE END OF THE DAY,</i> WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, ALL WE REALLY WANT IS TO BE CLOSE TO SOMEBODY...</i> COULDN'T STAY AWAY? SO THIS THING WHERE WE ALL KEEP OUR DISTANCE</i> AND PRETEND NOT TO CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER--</i> IT'S USUALLY A LOT OF BULL. DID YOU WANT TO COME IN? NO. UH, I JUST, UH... SHE'S AY? SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. GOOD. WE COULD BE YOUR FAMILY IF YOU WANT US. YOU HAVE A MOTHER, I KNOW. I'M NOT SAYING... I'M JUST SAYING THAT WE COULD BE YOUR FAMILY, TOO. SO WE PICK AND CHOOSE WHO WE WANT TO REMAIN CLOSE TO.</i> I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. (Izzie) WHAT? LET HER OFF THE HOOK. LET CRISTINA OFF THE FREAKIN' HOOK. MEREDITH... IZZIE, YOU CUT THE LVAD WIRE. SHE STUCK BY YOU AND DID DENNY'S ECHO. YOU CHEATED ON IZZIE WITH SYPH NURSE, AND SHE HELPED YOU STUDY FOR YOUR BOARDS. AND, GEORGE, WHEN EVERYBODY WAS CALLING YOU 007-- SHE WAS CALLING ME 007. JUST LET HER OFF THE HOOK. IT'S OKAY. SORRY. WHY CAN'T YOU MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS? YOU KNOW, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? YOU'RE MY SISTER. YOU'RE MY FAMILY. YOU'RE ALL I'VE GOT. AND ONCE WE'VE CHOSEN THOSE PEOPLE...</i> I'M SO TIRED. I KNOW. ME, TOO. WE TEND TO STICK CLOSE BY... UH, I WAS--I JUST-- I WANTED TO CHECK ON YOUR DAD AND SEE HOW HE WAS DOING. GOOD. HE'S RESTING, BUT HE'S GOOD. OKAY. OKAY. NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE HURT THEM.</i> HEY. (Derek) HI THERE. I'M GONNA GO BACK UPSTAIRS WITH DR. BURKE. HE WANTS ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT HIS SHOULDER. I'M GONNA BE A WHILE. DON'T WAIT UP, OKAY? OKAY. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL WITH YOU</i> AT THE END OF THE DAY... THOSE ARE THE ONES WORTH KEEPING.</i> AND SURE, SOMETIMES CLOSE CAN BE TOO CLOSE...</i> I COULDN'T STAY WITH THAT MAN. I DON'T CARE THAT HE-- THAT HE'S MEREDITH'S FATHER, I-I JUST COULDN'T TAKE IT, AND THEN RICHARD--AND HE-- AND HE... (sobbing) NO... (gasps) ??? mami
