be an issue anymore. She's out of my life. Good-bye,derek. You could start thinking about moving in with me. She's cute and she likes you. You shouldn't let a little syph get in the way. I like you,olivia. I just don't like you enough. Do you feel like doing it now? You're married? I'm pregna, you blind moron. How much sodium did you give him? 500 cc over 4 hours. Why didn't you do a follow-up? I gave you one thing to do I have a lot to teach if you want to learn. So when you decide how important it is for you to hate me, let me know. Dorie Russell, she's giving birth to quints. we're gonna need all the hands we can get. 40 years ago, the beatles asked the world a simple question.</i> He wanted to know where all the lonely people came from.</i> My lest theory is that a great many of the lonely people</i> come from hospitals. More precisely, the surgical wing of hospitals. I have the best quint. Lucy... She just smiled at me. She's 9 hours old,george. I'm sayin' there are five babies here, and clearly, mine is the advanced one. Charlotte's smart. She's got wrinkles on her forehead... very serious. Okay,"a," this is not a competition, and "b," my quint kicks your quints' asses. Emily's strong, she won't let go of my finger. Hey,julie has her organs on the outside of her body, and she's still alive, thank you. Kate's the best one. Izzie. Leave. Can we please just talk? You're too busy screwing nurses to talk. Just get out. Can someone make sure that kate's vitals remain stable? I will. He is unbelievable. I am so glad i never slept with him. Which is his loss, because i'm really good in bed... mind-blowing... mind-blowingly good in bed. Are you trying to seduce us? And then he sleeps with Olivia instead of me. Olivia. Hey,I slept with olivia.</i> Yeah? Well, then you both have bad taste. You know,you can't say that you weren't warned. Alex has always been alex. You dodged a bullet,izz. You're better off without him. Why are you even surprised? You sleep with a snake, you get bit. Thanks,guys, for the support. Who's on call tonight? I am. All right, the rest of you go home,sleep. All five quints are still alive. It's a good day. As surgeons, we ignore our own needs</i> so we can meet our patients' needs.</i> We ignore our friends and families</i> so we can save other people's friends and families.</i> Which means that, at the end of the day,</i> all we really have is ourselves...</i> and nothing in this world can make you feel more alone than that.</i> i made breakfast. Li don't have time for breakfast. I have to round before everyone else does if i want to get the good cases. You know that. Right. Well,coffee? Bye. So i was thinking we, i mean, me and you could maybe, uh,joe's later to talk by ourselves. why should i be the one to move? because you live in a glorified campground. It's 40 acres of some of the most beautiful land in seattle. I did not give up a central park brownstone to come live in the forest. Addi, Our house in the hamptons had trees. You didn't mind those trees, did you? They were the hamptons. Why are you pointing at me like that? I'm sorry. What were you saying? Uh,nothing. Ugh. Does anybody have any decent food? You really should eat breakfast. God,you sound like burke. You know,sometimes i think we'd be better off with dogs. Thanks. Preachin' to the choir. I'm over men. Real nice. a dog is not a replacement for a human being. You guys better wake her. If bailey catches her sleeping, she's dead. Izzie. Izzie. What? Hell hath no fury like a girl whose non-boyfriend screws a nurse. Bitch. I like you better pissed off. You're almost like a normal person now. Okay,what do we got? Uh,karl murphy,52 Multiple skin melanomas. Underwent reconstructive surgery to his nose his right ear, as well as a skin graft of the left index finger. how's the capillary refill? It's slow. About four seconds. What do you recommend to get that blood moving again,dr. O'malley? At this stage,our best option is probably a biotherapeutic agent. Wh-what is that? We put leeches on your face. Leeches? Huh,you don't say? They secrete blood thinners that help break up pooled blood so it can be evacuated. It's sort of like a big drain. Look,if this makes you uncomfortable... no,no,no. I've been a hiker for 40 years. Almost 40 years,yeah. And mother nature hasn't come up with anything yet i haven't found a reason to love. You a big outdoorsman? How do you think i got all these melanomas in the first place? Oh,dr. Shepherd, you're in early. If you'd like us to come back... No,go ahead. robert martin,45. Collapsed and hit his head, which caused a small subdural hemorrhage. That was the problem. Mr. Martin was found to have a rathke's cleft cyst on his pituitary, and surgery was postponed when... when i told a nurse... Oivia. When i told a nurse to administer an incorrect dosage of hypertonic saline. Essentially dehydrating mr. Martin's brain. He still has a chance. He could wake up and be fine. There's a chance. I know i screwed up. Just... put me back on this case,please. There's not much of a case left here,dr. Karev. You saw to that. You want back on this? Be my guest. oh,good. bvHere you are. Mom and dad are anxious for an update. Dr. Yang? we've done the initial surgery on julie's omphalocele. A primary closure was attempted, but there was pulmonary compromise, so we couldn't contin... yang, how about we do this in plain english? Oh,um,we operated on julie's external sack of organs, and we pushed in as much of the bowel as we could, and we think we can push in the rest with a second operation. She has to have a second operation? Yeah. Oh,well, not for a few days. dr. O'malley? We put in lucy's brain shunt yesterday, and she's doing very well. We just have to keep monitoring her to make sure that the spinal fluid doesn't back up. Stevens? Dr. Burke used a catheter to open emily's atrial septum last night. Today we're gonna go in and try to reconstruct the left chamber of her heart. We're very hopeful. Dr. Grey? Charlotte's lungs were a little more underdeveloped than the rest of the quints So we put a special mask on her to help her breathe and we're monitoring her closely. And that just leaves kate. She seems to be pretty healthy. No major issues have been identified. But we're gonna keep her in the isolette until she makes it to 4 pounds. You hear that,honey? Kate's doing really well. I'll be in my room. Dr. Shepherd... tom,she's just had five babies. Her hormones are all over the place. You've just got to give her some time. She'll come around. Grey,keep an eye on the mother of the quints. Make sure her hormones don't get the best of her. I can look out for dorie. No,you have emily's heart surgery with dr. Burke. But i have a relationship with the mother. Why are you arguing with me? Because i don't understand why i'm being pushed off of a case... hey,stevens,i don't know what you're so angry about, but i don't care,and you better keep it to yourself. On top of every other patient we have under our care, we have quints to worry about, understood? Look,these are preemies, people. They were supposed to have spent another eight weeks in the womb. Just like interns, they're not ready for the real world. Oh,it's the pit. Yang, come with me. Constance ferguson,40, inmate at henderson, swallowed a razor blade. Attempted suicide? Attempted field trip. Worked,too. What do you mean,"field trip"? She was in solitary This is her way out. So is she crazy? Only if you'd call a murderer crazy. Yeah,baby. That's what i'm tain' about. Whoo! ms. Ferguson,are you experiencing any discomfort? You mean apart from these snazzy handcuffs you've got pinching my wrists? Did you at least put tape on the blade? I'm not an idiot. You swallowed a razor blade. So you're not gonna tell me what hurts? What,and shorten my vacation? Hey,since you're just standing around, why don't you get me some chocolate pudding? Make thelade go down smoother. Yang,get an x-ray. Make it portable. With prisoners,we have to minimize flight risk. Okay,okay,but i'm supposed to check on julie. I thought you said we're supposed to keep a close eye on the quints. Julie's my quint,too. I got that covered. You do this. Are you sure you can't do it? I can. I choose not to. Come on,baby. I'm not gonna hurt you. I only murdered three people, and none of them were doctors. Olivia. Dr. O'malley. How are the leeches doing? They're not. I still can't get them to bite. With all this blood,you'd think it'd be a no-brainer for a leech. sometimes they get a little anxious... bright lights, thunder storms,you know... ohh! Nervous handlers. I'm sorry. I should be better at this. I still get a little squeamish around leeches. Oh,that is not what i have heard. Dr. O'malley can take over from here. Whoa,whoa. What was that all about? Nothing. There we are. He's in. I had no idea that you and alex were a couple. It's just... i was having a bad day, and it was good to have someone. Good to talk to,i mean. Not good to... alex really is good. I mean,he's good in the way he's a good person good. Not the other kind of good. You know, good in bed good. Which,he is, as i'm sure you know. But... okay,well... bye. Any temperature spikes? No,no fever. Vitals are stable. Good. That's very good. Go ahead. After you. Thank you. So you're giving up the trailer? I'm not giving up the trailer. Is addison telling people that i'm giving up the trailer? It's just funny. I ju would never have pegged you for that guy. What guy? You know, the marble bath, private pool,gated-community guy. Don't peg me. I'm not peggable. You're pegged. Deal with it. B.p. 's low. She's tachycardic sats? Dropping on high-flow 02. No breathing sounds on the right side. Her lung has collapsed. Should i call the other dr. Shepherd? There's no time. Here,stick this between her second and third rib. Do not go too deep. You're gonna hear a small gush of air. I heard it. Nice job. Thank you. I'm not giving up the trailer. Whatever you say, dr. Shepherd. Her lung collapsed? And i know it sounds scary, but it's reay not that uncommon in a preemie this size. So we've inserted a tube into charlot's chest, and that will help her breathe until her lung can stay up on its own. Mrs. Russell? She really is doing fine now. That's me. I gotta go. My mom can only handle the triplets for half a day. She's 74,so... i'll call you as soon as i get home,okay? I love you. Could you,uh... i'll keep an eye on her. Thank you. Okay. Dorie. This isn't your fault. You can't blame yourself for this. I've got one baby who can barely breathe and one with half a heart Two of the others are... if i'd have listened to the doctors, i could've had three healthy girls instead of five who might not live until tomorrow. It was my decision. Tom agreed with the doctors. So really,dr. Grey... who else should i blame? First step in the norwood is the cardiopulmonary bypass. With h. I.h. s., what else do you get besis hyperplasia of the ventricle? Stenosis or atresia of the mitral and aortic valves. Why are we using the rv-pa conduit instead of the modified blalock-taussig shunt? It limits diastolic runoff. Well,you've done your homework. I was on call last night. I study when i'm on call. well,no matter what the books say, i guarantee you you have never seen a heart this small. Betcha i have. How you doing,you? You know, i'm having a baby,too. Yes,i am. A little boy. Maybe you can meet him someday. How's that sound? Does that sound good? We could... pregnancy has not made me soft. I haven't gone soft. I don't do soft. Of course not. You were just talking to a patient. What's this? The inmate's x-rays. that foolish,foolish woman. She swallowed four razor blades? Mm-hmm. Hey! Hey you! Hey,nurse! Would you keep it down, please? I'm starving. You're n. p. o. No food allowed. Come on,april,baby, don't go for him. He's such an idiot. I didn't come here to starve to death. I want mint chocolate chip ice cream. Mint,okay? Not rocky road. You tter not get me that rocky road. It sucks. Oh,thank god. Mama bear,help me out here, okay? I'm starving. Don't give her anything. See,right there you're in official violation of the eighth amendment. You can't eat anything because you're about to undergo major surgery. What? What's she talkin' about? You're at risk for a perforated intestine and half a dozen kinds of infection. We need to operate right away. I don't need an operation. I taped up the blade like i always do. It passes the next day. What's the big deal? You swallowed four blades this time. That's the big deal. I thought it would buy me an extra day. Does this operation have a nice, long recovery time? you realize this is major surgery? It's dangerous and you could die. Mint chocolate chip. I want at least a gallon after you ghouls are done splitting me open. what exactly is it that we're doing? We're visiting. We've thrown all this medical talk at you and outlined all these worst-case scenarios, which has probably scared you half to death The one thing we haven't done is actually given you a chance to be with your daughters. Well,how is that gonna help? If i learned anything in these past few days, it's that i need to face reality. Here's kate. You can reach in and touch her if you like. I would like to very much. dr. Grey, charlotte's not breathing. Page addison shepherd. She's in the o. r. we didn't see this on the echo. You can never get an exact measurement. What? The baby's aorta is narrower than we thought. The diameter is only a millimeter. Just not getting enough blood flow. Damn. I wanted you to see this before i started closing up. You're closing up? You didn't do anything. Dr. Stevens. No,we barely started. Dr. Burke has done as much as he can do for now so unless you know how to do a first stage norwood, he's gonna close this baby's chest. You okay? I'm fine. May i go? Yes. What happened? She had an apneic episode. She's still not breathing on her own. let's intubate and give her surfactant. Push. 1 atropine and 3 milligrams of ketamine. Meds are in. Tube. Okay. Place the c02 detector. She was doing fine with the chest tube. That's the thing with r. d. s. Cases. Just when you think the baby's getting better, they can slip right back. Breath sounds equal. Good. Mrs. Russell. Unbelievable. Who would do this to themselves? The woman wasn't just in prison,yang, she was in solitary. Well,she was seriously deranged. You try spending a month locked in a room with no windows, no one to talk to 23 hours a day, see how deranged she is then. Dr. Bailey, she's a murderer. I didn't say she wasn't. One,two,three... i said try having no one to make your snarky comments to for a solid month. My guess is you'd swallow the entire razor. How are they treating you, Mr. Murphy? Oh,i've done worse for company. Oh,they're definitely filling up. The tissue is getting nice and pink. You make up with that cute little girlfriend of yours yet? Olivia's hardly my girlfriend. Is she okay? She? Yeah. Isabella. And this one here on my finger... that's darcy. And that little guy on my nose... named o'malley. That's right. I named hiafter you. You're the one that got him to bite. Isabella's fine. She's just full. Oh. Oh. Wwait,what are you gonna do with her? She's done her job. We don't really have any more use for her except as medical waste. No. I'd like to keep her, if i could. crazy nature man. You wanna take a leech home as a pet? That's fine with me. You had no right to speak to me that way in front of a patient. Yeah? Well, you hurt my friend. I had no idea alex was seeing izzie. That's not what you're upset about. You have no idea why i'm upset. Besides,you know what i don't understand is,uh, why alex, and why again? People get lonely,george. Hi,mr. Russell. It's meredith grey calling. I was wondering if there was any chance maybe you could bring your boys by to visit their mom. I think she could use the company. Oh,the flu. No,definitely don't bringhem. Thank you. You too. you've been lying low. Well,nobody's talking to me so it makes it kind of easy,right? I'm talking to you... in short, monosyllabic sentences laced with disdain and contempt. So,what, according to girl rules, now you all have to hate me? I don't hate you. If my mother hadn't gotten alzheimer's, i'd probably be you. Oh,really? Really. Before she got sick, i mean,i... i mean,i finished college,but i was partying way too much, staying out way too late to keep a job. I was the one at family reunions everybody was embarrassed to talk about. So that's what you think of me? Are you okay? I almost killed a guy yesterday. Mr. Martin. So i'm just trying to find anything i can to help him. Okay,well, what are we looking for? Uh,anything on central pontine myelinolysis. unbelievable. Izzie. Izzie,come on. Come on? Come on? You're fraternizin with the enemy, and you're telling me to come on. Alex and i are sort of friends. Since when? Since when are you and alex friends? You tell me to cut my losses, that i'm better off without him, and as soon as i turn my back... izzie,you're making way too big a deal outta this. Right,of course,because i'm the unreasonable one. You know what,meredith? Do whatever you want. Sleep with the guy for all i care. Well,obviously i'm not going to sleep with him,izzie. Why not? You've slept with everyone else. You'll have some abdominal pain for a day or two... just a day or two? We'll watch you until your bowels start moving again. The average is about 36 hours. 36? 4 razor blades, and that's all you can give me? Come on,sugar plum. I thought we were having fun. Don't leave. What? Just maybe a little conversation. I mean,they got me in here all by myself. I thought i'd have a roommate, somebody to talk to. Okay. Why'd you kill three people? Start off a little small talk, why don't you? I was high... on meth. And i had this boyfriend who... had this robbery all planned out. He said that he would leave me if i didn't help him. Things got out of control. He was gonna leave me. He... he was all i had. I would've been all alone. Clearly,being alone has its benefits. You paged me? Another leech fell off, and i can't get the new one to bite. I'm sorry. They just really freak me out. I'm a surgeon,olivia. You're an intern,george. You know what time it is? Time for you two kids to kiss and make up, that's what time it is. Mr. Murphy, we are not a couple. Oh,you can't pull much over on me. Now i say there's something between the two of you. You're right,mr. Murphy. There was. Olivia,this isn't the time. And this.. really isn't the place. He broke up with me for this girl who doesn't even know that he's alive. She does so know i'm alive. Listen to me,george. You,meredith grey... never gonna happen. What? Why... why would you even think it's meredith? Anyone who's paying the slightest bit of attention knows how you feel about meredith, except meredith, which should tell you something,shouldn't it? Sorry,mr. Murphy. She gave me syphilis. Remember what you did to me when i was an intern? How could i forget? You didn't speak to me for almost a year. But you learned. Yeah,well,i think i gotta do that to izzie stevens. Well,she's smart, hardworking. Gets a little too involved with her patients. A lot like you. I know. It took me a long time to recover from that,richard. But it made you a better surgeon,addison. The question is, is she talented enough to make the lesson worth it? She's the best i've seen in years. I was hoping that we could... you're not here to make friends,addison. You're here to make better surgeons, and being a teacher can be a lonely business. I'm telling you, meredith was all over him. Seriously? She was all over him? What,like,uh,mounting him with all the babies watching? Seriously? Well,she would've been if i hadn't interrupted. She was talking to him. You don't talk to bastards who cheat on their girlfriends, george. That's the rule. You weren't officially his girlfriend. That's not the point. It is kind of the point. You don't see me getting I emotional over people i'm not dating. Really? You wanna go there? No. I'm having a moment here. Don't mess with me. You're not gonna have a nervous breakdown or kill yourself, are you? No. So there's no chance you'll kill us? Oh,that was wrong on so many levels. So good. That was... that was good. Yeah,it was good. Your lungs are not good. I know we got you out of there a little earlier than you would've wanted. We have to find something to help you. So if you have any ideas,charlotte... dr. Stevens. Dr. Shepherd, is there something you need? Yes,dr. Burke and i have reassessed. We think there's a chance with the norwood if emily can make it through the next ten hours. Would you look after her for the night? I s on call last night. But,i mean,yeah, of course. Good. I've left a list of meds, and you're familiar with pediatric life support? Got myself certified as soon as i got in the program. Okay then. Is there anything else i should know to look out for? No. That should do it. Should i notify mrs. Russell about emily's... No. I've done that. Dr. Stevens,this baby is your responsibility. She better be alive when i get back in the morning. Okay. Dr. Shepherd, i found these studies where they used aggressive plasmapheresis. I think these could work on mr. Martin. Those are all isolated cases. But still,the studies resulted in improved clinical symptoms. No trial study's ever been done. There is nothing you can do. Okay,what about thyrotropin releasing hormone? No,no. There's european studies... karev,it's over. It's done. You screwed up. Mr. Martin's fried. You fried his brain. If he wakes up, you put him in a wheelchair. If he dies, you killed him. Deal with it. dr. Stevens,baby's v02 is still 40% after transfusion. How's her b. p. Doing? Still low. Last systolic was 52. Okay,i'm gonna push 30 cc's of n. s. Manually. Nice start. Pressure's 65. hey,izz. Okay,really? You think i'm talking to you? Well,i just wanted to say i'm sorry. What are you sorry for? When derek broke up with you, i never once said," you're better off without him. " It's not supportive. It's condescending. I was there. All i ever am is there for you guys, and the one time i need you... just... go away,meredith. what the hell happened? She was fine. She just started seizing. She's not seizing, she's choking. she swallowed a lightbulb. We're losing her. I can see that. Don't you think i can see that? She needs an airway. Oh,she's clamped down. I can't intubate. We need some help in here. You want me to get paralytic to relax the muscles? Uh,no. She'll be dead by then. Li need a scalpel for a crich. ave you done one? Of course not. Go. I was gonna do a crich. How long has she been unconscious? She just went down. Prep o. r. 2. Emergency thoracotomy. Right away Cristina,it'll be okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. She's coding. Again? Okay,uh, turn up the epi drip. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi,dorie. What are you doing? I'm packg. Dorie,you've just had major abdominal surgery. You're not in any condl... i'm going home,dr. Grey i need to go home. I can't be here. I can't watch them die. They're not dying. They're trying to live. And you leaving them isn't going to help them. I have three boys who need me. Your daughters need you. Don't you understand that i can't do it? I can't do it. They're too sick. They're too hurt. Which is why they need their mother. If emily dies,I... if emily dies, it will be horrible. But if emily dies, and you're not here... i can't even hold them. But you can sit with them and talk to them and let them know they're not alone in this world. That's all they need. That's all anybody... what? I think i know how to help charlotte. I don't know why i didn't think of this sooner. What are you doing? It's called cobedding. Hospitals sometimes do it with twins when one of them is sick. And the other one gets... better? It helps. How? We don't really know. Sometimes babies get stressed in the i. c. u. S from all the activity. This way,there's someone there to comfort them, to be there with them. That's excellent blood flow at all three places. You're healing very nicely. And i like my new nose. Well,i'm sure your wife will like it,too. I'm not so sure what she'll say about your new houseguests. Oh,i'm gonna let these guys go in the lake near my favorite hiking trail. Saved my face. Least i can do for 'em. And i don't have a wife. Oh,i'm sorry. I thought your wedding ring... no,i'm divorced. Just never took it off. By the way,uh... sorry you had to see that little scene earlier. Oh,you mean talking with the girl who isn't your girlfriend about the girl who you'd like to be your girlfriend. Yeah. She shouldn't have said that stuff. It's just... she was... very unprofessional. Yeah,but is it true? Do you like this meredith person? I don't think that's really any of your business. She's okay. I like her okay. All right,i love her. Oh,come on. Don't be embarrassed. I loved my wife. But sometimes,no matter how much you love someone, they just can't love you back in the same way. Believe me,son. Living with a woman who can't love you back... way lonelier than being alone. what do you want to do? We can... we can put her on ecmo. Baby this size,you're risking intracranial hemorrhage. Um,she's already coded three times. You paged dr. Shepherd? She called to say you have to handle this for yourself. What? I'm an intern. What is she... dr. Stevens? Just give me a second. You don't have a second. Okay,ecmo is too dangerous. We're just gonna have to keep her going on epi. Too much epi, it'll stop her circulation. There's no point in keeping her heart rate up if she doesn't have functioning arms or legs in the morning. I know that. I'm sorry. It's... we're just gonna have to keep pushing epi. It's our best option. We'll just have to find a middle ground you can do this. i can't believe you would consider moving out of your trailer. The view alone... See the mist rise off the lake. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not moving. you're still you? I'm still me. Good. where's emily? They took her away. Where? Why didn't you wake me? Dr. Shepherd told us not to. What? Where is the baby? Dr. Stevens,she died half an hour ago. It wasn't your fault. You put me icharge. I fell asleep. I killed that by. No,you didn't. She was gonna die anyway. She had a restricted atrial septum and virtually no aorta. As soon as dr. Burke opened up her chest, we knew she didn't have a chance. I don't get it. You ordered me to stay the night... Take care of her. I worked my ass off doing c. p. r. And pumping her fulL of every drug on the planet, and, i mean,god,do you have any idea how scared i was? It was all for nothing? Hardly. If the situation ever comes up again, i know you'll be able to handle the pressure. You lied to me. You have to learn distance, stevens. You'll be a better doctor for it. A better... a better doctor? I heard you worked a miracle last night. She came around so fast, i thought the equipment was malfunctioning. Her sats are completely stable She's gonna make it. Go home,grey. You've earned it. And,grey... way to go. Did you hear that? "Way to go. " My baby died. We know. She just... ...died. I have an idea. the first person i killed... i was a second-year resident. James hanson. You should go home,alex. There's nothing you can do here. nobody should die alone. 400 years ago, another well-known english guy</i> had an opinion about being alone... john donne. He thought we were never alone. Of course,it was fancier when he said it.</i> Don't... don't try and talk. Your windpipe was perforated. Dr. Burke repaired it, and you should be fine. we'll keep you here at least ten days for observation and make sure there's no infection. Maybe just to be on the safe side, we'll make it two weeks. no man is an island entire unto himself. oh. That's him. Yeah. That's him. i'm lonely,derek. Boil down that island talk, and he just meant</i> that all anyone needs is someone to step in...</i> and let us know we're not alone.</i> Good boy,doc. And who's to say that someone can't have four legs?
