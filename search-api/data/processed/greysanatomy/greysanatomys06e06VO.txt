We start by getting the patient's point of view...</i> Though they often don't have a clue what's going on.</i> So we look at the patient from every possible angle.</i> We rule things out. We uncover new information... Trying to get to what's actually wrong.</i> We're asked for second opinions...</i> Hoping we'll see something others might have missed.</i> For the patient, a fresh perspective</i> Can mean the difference between living and dying.</i> For the doctor... It can mean you're picking a fight</i> With everyone who got there before you.</i> - Someone's getting fired. - Stop it. She wasn't even my patient. - What? - Nothing. How long is this gonna take? Why, you need to me a phone call? I said enough! What happened here tonight, What happened to that patient, was inexcusable. And we're gonna be here Till I find out who's responsible for it. So until then, you will sit down, You will shut up and you'll wait to be called. Hunt. I'm not going down for this. Someone is. Dr. Hunt, you know larry jennings from our board. And this is our in-house counsel. We're just trying to get in front of this thing,  I need you to give me The lay of the land of your e.R. Tonight, from the beginning. We were slammed with a mass casualty, a hotel fire-- Half a dozen burn victims, a penetrating chest wound,</i> A firefighter with multiple traumas.</i> What doctors were working? Yang, grey, karev, adamson, That big kid whose name I don't know, kepner,</i> Avery and torres. And who was on the patient in question, the one that died? Everyone. Everyone was everywhe. All right. Who got the chart first? Dr. Yang. It wasn't my patient. I had it for two seconds, and then I was called outside. Okay, start from the beginning. I was paged to the e.R. I'm putting myself on a time-out Before I kill someone. Have you seen bailey? She was supposed to sign my discharge papers after her appy. Good. You know, go home, get better and then come back, - 'cause I need you. - Are the mercy west people that bad? They're everywhere and there are more of them than us, And they're kicking our asses. God, I miss izzie. - We need more "uses," so get back here. - I have to be discharged first. - You want to forge bailey's signature? - No, that'll get me fired. Ask one of the new ones to do it. Get them fired. Time-out's over. Well, send bailey. Try to keep the burn unit and the trauma rooms clear. And call respiratory. We need ventilators on standby. I got a burn victim and her kid. - Take your pick. - Yang, come with me. - We can help. - Great. Here. Take these. I handed it off. To who? Who did you hand it to? I have no idea. - I got her chart. - yang, come with me. We can help. Great. Here. Take these. Sucks. Yang's turfing us all the crap cases While she runs outside for the good ones. Cathy Becker? - Yes, hi. - And you must be danny. I'm dr. Adamson. Can you come this way with me? Okay, sweetie. Come on. All right. We were driving up to vancouver To visit my husband. He's up there for work. And the rain wouldn't let up, so we thought, you know, Why don't we just stop for the night? Bet you wish you kept driving ? All right, can you lean forward... And take a deep breath. I'm glad you made it out. - Thank god we were on the first floor. - I was scared. My mom getted burned. Mommy's all right, baby. You're safe. - Everybody is all right, okay? - Everybody's safe now. - Can you say "ahh" for me? - Ahh. Very good. See? One for them. and one for us. Stop being so paranoid. They hate us. It doesn't matter how good we are, we're gonna fail Because they were here first and they rule the school - And they hate us. - I'm not gonna let them turn me into someone they can hate. - I'm easy to like. - Actually, it takes a while. I hated you at first. Just shut up. Sorry. Okay. Your lungs sound good. Your vitals are great. Open up, please. Oh, my god. Well, charlie got a good one. See? We win. Okay. You look good. These burns on your chest are pretty minor. But the one on your calf might be third-degree, So what I'm gonna do, hang on one second. Dr. Sloan. I'm just gonna have the plastic surgeon Come and take a look, okay? I just did her initial exam. She was a burn patient and she wasn't surgical. - There was--there was nothing more for me to do for her. - And at that point, you went I went to go help dr. Bailey. What did I just say?! I got it! Dr. Bailey really needed some help. He fainted. He fainted? He fainted. - From what? - Better have a brain tumor or something, 'cause that's just unacceptable. There was a blood drive today. This place is a freakin' maze. I've gotten lost, like, 11 times. No joke. - I lost a patient. - That's bad, dude. - How'd  die? - No, I lost her. Parked her in a hallway, Went to get her labs, couldn't find the hallway. - Of course, no one would help me. - Yeah, don't even ask for help. These seattle grace people are kinda douchey. Case in point. Douche. It's the e.R. Mass casualty. Hey, I need to, Emergency. I'm a surgeon. Hello. Apparently, he grabbed the fire ax out of the case and tried to run down the stairs with it. Mom was right. No running on the stairs. Okay, on my count-- one, two, three. Okay, I want a c.B.C., chem panel, And make sure there's an o.R. Ready--wait, wait. Just stop. I need to see what I'm looking at. - You have steady hands? - Yes, ma'am. In college, I was I don't want your life story. I need both hands on this handle. Do not push the ax in. Do not pull the ax out. Do not move. Understand? Yep. In retrospect, I should've had a cookie. Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. What did I just say? I got it! Here. Apply pressure. Okay, come with me. Hey, karev. Clean that up. - And that was the last you saw of the patient? - Yes, with dr. Sloan, who treated her burn. - No, he didn't. I treated her burn. - You did?

At that point? - I took him to x-ray, yes.</i> Did you ever hear mrs. Becker say anything about pain? No. The nurse did. He said she was in a lot of pain. - Whose patient is bed one, Cathy becker? - Not mine. She's complaining of pain. At this point, who was in charge</i> Of mrs. Becker's care? Whose patient was she? - I was never on her. - I was in the o.R. With dr. Bailey. - I'm not--I-I don't-- - not mine. - No idea. - Did you order pain meds? No, yang did. Next time I saw her, She was... She was dying. When you saw her, she was dying? No, she wasn't dying. She said she had some pain. - Whose patient is bed one, Cathy becker? - Not mine. She's complaining of pain. Hey, karev. You got bed one? - No. - Your initials are on the chart, man. So you checked with karev?</i> - I tried to. He was on the phone. - I had never even seen that patient. - I-I was stitching up nosedive. - Nosedive? What's his name? The--the dude that fainted. - Dr. Percy. - Nosedive. That's gonna stick.

I'm done talking to your mom, who's probably lying to me. Are you gonna help me with this? Listen, it's been a week, iz. And I don't know if you're alive or dead. So if I don't hear from you by tonight, I am calling the police And I'm reporting you as a missing person. - So who gave her the morphine? - No idea. I never even saw her. I ordered it. I did. Your initials are on the chart. How long do I have to work here Before they insert a bug up my ass? You guys are all so cranky. Dr. Avery seemed uncomfortable</i> Consulting on a patient that wasn't his. So I checked with the patient and asked her about her pain,</i> And she said it was localized to her chest burns.</i> So I checked her chart for any allergies or drug interactions</i> And saw that she had silver sulfadiazine</i> D 1 gram of cefazolin and 800 of ibuprofen,</i> So I ordered 2 of morphine. - You memorized her chart? - Yeah, I checked it three times 'cause she wasn't my patient. So you ordered the morphine. Did you follow up ? No. My patient had come back from c.T. All right, people, people, listen up. The burn unit and the I.C.U. Are full. All patients are staying here until some beds open up, All right? Let's keep the trauma rooms clear - For the burn cases, please. - Head c.T. Was fine. Abdominal scans show a liver lac and possible kidney hematoma. I'm gonna check on an o.R. Page me when he's stable. That's him. The kid-- the kid in the window. Is he dying? I don't know what he's here for He's fine, roy. He's being taken care of. - You saved his life. - Oh, no. No. I killed him. Can I ask something? You say the patient asked for meds for pains in her chest? No, on her chest. She had burns. All right, thank you, dr. Yang. Are you saying that she had chest pains, That I ordered the wrong medication? It's hard to say. The next entry on her chart was dr. Grey - Putting in a chest tube, so - Thank you, dr.

I know. You're okay, pal. - You're gonna be okay. - That's what I thought at first, too About the rain. Dr. Grey, you grew up here, right? So you get used to the rain? Lexie. Dr. Grey, step out. Come back when you've got it together. Go. She can't breathe. It's okay. I'm okay. My mom. She can't breathe. It was a pneumothorax. - What's that? - Her lung collapsed. One, two, three. Danny... Don't let him see me die. You're not gonna die. I promise. One, two, three. you got the chest tube in?</i> - No, I was getting there. I was counting - did you go in below the fifth intercostal space? - You could've punctured her diaphragm. - I know--I just-- I lost count. Why ? Four... Did you get the chest tube in? - I did. I-I did. I-I just... - She did. She just missed a step. One, two, three, four, f-- Why did you do that? I had to, okay? She was running out of time. It was a tension pneumothorax. You have to relieve the pressure So that she doesn't croak before you put the chest tube in. - Do you want me to do it? - No, I-I can do it. I-I got it. Three, four, five. - And did she have it? - Yeah, I watched.</i> - She--she was a little distracted, but-- - You were distracted? - What were you-- - dr. Yang was making a toddler cry. Stop! What the hell are you doing? Okay, let me just say for the record</i> That it was no toddler. - He was, like, 5 if he was a day. - Yang - You would've yelled at him, too. - Why was he there in the first place? - I don't know how he got there. The patient was coding and-- - the patient was coding? - Coags are stable. - Good, o.R. Is ready. Yang, you're with me. Torres, adamson will call you - When we're ready for the femur. - Roy, your whole crew's in the waiting room. They'll see you after. They're saying you're a hero. Tell him I'm sorry. Tell him I'm so sorry. - Who is he talking about? - The kid in trauma 2. Roy, he's fine. - He's gonna be-- - Almost had him. I was at the window. I could feel his fingers in my hand. I went to pull him out, and--and I missed a step. - One stupid mistake. - You fell, roy. It was an accident. He was burning. And then I went... V-tach. - No pulse. - Start c.P.R. Bag him. Push one of epi. Charging to 200. Or that works, too. thanks. Had it. Stop! Wwhat the hell are you doing? - Who was watching that kid ? - that's what I said. Hey, hey, who's watching this kid? I took the kid. He was with me, but I-I can't watch him. I'm supposed to be in trauma 2. All right, I-I-I got him. I'll take him. Come on. - And you lefthis mother alone? - She was stable,</i> And--and I was supposed to be with the boy. - But his mother had a collapsed lung. - No, no, no, not that boy. I was supposed to be with the other boy. - You want something sweet for dinner? - What the hell are you doing? I have to sit with him until his dad comes. I left him alone-- No, you left him. Come here. Can you sit with him until his dad comes? Thanks. You left him alone. When were you planning to-- - I'm s--I'm sorry. I just-- I-I feel like-- - No, you don't get to feel anything Because he's feeling everything. His every nerve is exposed and raw, and we have to Make him feel worse before he's gonna feel better. So if you're having feelings, then you need tohut them down. You need to shut them down and talk to him about his future And remind him that he has one past all of this pain. And if you can't do that, if you can't do your job, Then you find someone who can and you send them to me. Did you see mrs. Becker again?</i> - No. - Did you see karev perform an emergency cricothyrotomy? I wasn't there. I was right there. I saw it. Then you find someone who can and you send them to me. Have you seen karev? He didn't finish my stitches. No, I-I-I don't... Doctor, she's not breathing. Move. Move, move, move. Get me a 7 e.T. Tube. Ah. Oh, crap. She's completely closed off. I can't see her cords. - You can't intubate a patient? - Of course I can, I just... I was having trouble. Her airway was completely closed off. I mean, I couldn't tube her either. What's going on? There's too much swelling in the airway. - Get me a smaller tube, a 6-0. - 6-0. Here you go. - Damn it. - Move! - Did karev try to intubate? - First charles tried to tube her, then reed came to help, - And then karev performed the crike. - I thought you didn't see it. I did. I-- And you didn't try and help? There's too much swelling in the airway. - Get me a smaller tube, a 6-0. - 6-0. Here you go. Move! She needs a crike. My patient needed me. Here's the thing about the rain-- It usually just drizzles. It's--it's not like tonight. But when it stops, Everything is super green, And it's beautiful, and it smells like trees. You know that smell? Dr. Karev seemed to have it under control. - Karev seemed totally out of control. - Move! She needs a crike. Get me an ambu bag. He was pale, shaky, just... Really unsteady.</i> She's got no landmarks. I was hoping that... What are you-- You're going in blind? Hit the carotid. - Hit the carotid. and he kept saying something</i> About hitting her carotid. Did you give blood today, dr. Karev? - What? - You've been described as looking, "pale, shaky and unsteady." We already had one doctor pass out after giving blood. - I'm asking-- - We all give blood. - Avery gave blood, - yang gave blood, Grey gave blood. I give blood every two months. Just because some dumb-ass didn't eat a cookie-- I'm asking if you gave blood today, dr. Karev. No. And you haven't heard from her since then? You'll tell me if she calls? Right. I know, robbie. Thanks. These seattle grace people are kinda douchey. Case in point. Douche. Wait, wait. Don't stick me. I gotta go. Sorry. So what was the problem? - There was no problem. - There was a problem. I came back from seeing the firefighter off to surgery. My guys would like to line the hall for roy When he comes out of surgery. You know, make a show of support. - He's, 35 years on the job, so we figured we would-- - That's great. That's, Ex-excuse me. and there was a problem,</i> - And charles waved me over to help. - No, I wasn't waving at reed. - I was waving at karev, but he wouldn't get off the phone. - He what? Oh, crap. She's completely closed off. I can't see her cords. Come home so we can talk. - I hung up the phone. - What the hell was so important, karev? I hung up the phone, I came over and I criked her. After another doctor got there first. A patient was dying. - I hung up... the phone. Yeah, that--oh, that's good and tight there. Hello. Izzie? Hello, iz. - Hey. - Where are you? Are you okay? No, I know. Your mom-- your mom, she said she-- You left him alone. - When were you planning to-- - I'm sorry. I feel like-- I'm asking you to wait, please. No, I got--look, just wait. - Iz... Just come home. - Doctor! - Come home and we can talk about it. - Move, move, move. Get me a 7 e.T. Tube. - Wait, what does that mean? - Coming through. - You're not coming back yet Or you're not coming back? Just wait, wait, wait. Iz, just give me a number. Give me a number, and I'll call you back. Give me a number so--I have to-- look, just give me a number. - Iz - Get me a smaller tube, a 6-0. I--wait. Izzie, just-- damn it. Move! She needs a crike. Ambu bag. She's got no landmarks. I was hoping that she would-- What are you-- you're going in blind? Don't hit the carotid. Don't hit the carotid. Don't hit the carotid. Don't hit the carotid. Got it. Start ventilating. I got there in time. I did the crike. I got off the phone. - I stayed with her after that. - And at that point, you had her under control.</i> It was a good crike. She was stable.</i> Then out of nowhere, we started to lose her.</i> She's got pulmonary edema. Switch to high-frequency jet ventilation. Get a c.B.C., lytes, a.B.G.-- Just shotgun her, get everything. She had a.R.D.S. B.P. Was dropping. We started fluids. She was sinking fast. Trauma 1 is clear. We should move her. - What happened? Why is she-- - I-I don't know. Hey, can you give me a hand? - Somebody page hunt and get me those labs. - I got her labs. I was shocked. You're a.K., right? April kepner? No, no. This is alex karev. Wait a second. What the hell? Her carbon monoxide level was 28, And she was spiraling down. what the hell? B.P. Is 69 over 32. Pulse is 158. We're already filling her with fluids. Yeah. She was acidotic. We pushed bicarb. They needed more hands. Keep her on 100% oxygen. No, no, do not. Not until she is more stable. Cristina, scrub out, go see if you can help. Go. There was so much swelling, we couldn't find good veins. We had to start a central line. We can't use the hyperbaric chamber - Until she's stable. - Her c.K. Level's over 75,000. She's got fulminant rhabdo. Everything was failing-- the--the kidneys, liver, lungs. Her chart was like a phone book now. - She's in s.V.T. Push 6 of adenosine. - Systolic's in the 70s. Um, start her on dopamine--5 mics. She was coding when I got there. What the hell? - She's in v-fib. - Okay, starting manual ventilation. Charging to 200. Clear. 300. Clear. No, there's blood. Wait! She started bleeding out. She's got blood in her crike tube. She's got blood in the tube. Oh, my god. I know what happened. I know why she died. Get an amp of bicarb in her! - Push one of epi. - What about calcium? Did anyone try calcium? Get two more units of p.R.B.C.S in here! - And bring some f.F.P.! - Where is all this blood coming from? - D.I.C.--Her organs are shutting down. - She's bleeding out. She is bleeding out. Just stop. Stop. Everybody, stop! It's over. You've lost her. Somebody call it. Well, whose patient is she? Whose patient is this? What? I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry. Dr. Kepner. What did you tell them? What did you say? I don't know you. But dr. Adamson just spent 20 minutes in that chair Telling me what an excellent doctor you are. Your school records, Your evaluation from mercy west all say the same thing. And I believe it. I believe you're good. Dr. Webber, I-I don't know-- So you should be able to tell me what would've caused Cathy becker to bleed out and die From multisystem organ failure. She had d.I.C. - Burns can cause massive tissue injury-- - But the burn was properly cleaned and dressed. There must have been more damage. I mean, she had a collapsed lung. That's right. She needed a chest tube. But why would her lungs have failed? She... She went into respiratory distress. They said they criked he I wasn't there for any of this. And why would she need a crike? Why not intubate? - Her airway was too swollen. They couldn't get - But what would cause that inflammation in her throat? Soot. Smoke inhalation. But she didn't have-- How did mrs. Becker's throat look? No, she wasn't hoarse. She  wasn't coughing. How did it look, dr. Kepner? Her breath sounds were good. her respiratory rate was What I'm asking you... What it looked like. Okay. Your lungs sound good, and your vitals are great. - Open up, please. - Oh, my god. Okay. You look good. These burns on your chest are pretty minor. But the one on your calf might be third-degree.</i> You never looked. You didn't look in her throat, Because if you had, you would've seen soot. And you uld've intubated immediately. And none of this would've ever happened. - No, that's, it was. I got distracted. - I know. - It was--it was insane. - I know. It was a simple mistake. In the circumstances you were under, I know-- I'm sorry, dr. Kepner. - No, I m--I missed one step. - I know. And look what it's led to. - She's bleeding out. She is bleeding out. - Just stop. Stop. Everybody, stop! It's over. You've lost her. Whose patient is she? Whose patient is this? Time of death is 12:45 a.M. You're fired. Oh, my god. Danny. Oh, god. You're okay. Oh. Where's your mommy, pal? Let's go find mommy, huh? When we're headed toward an outcome</i> That's too horrible to face... That's when we go looking for a second opinion.</i> It's not the doctors, richard. They're all good doctors. I know that. What do you think this was for? For jennings, it was about legal. But this was for me. I needed to know who finally was responsible. At least I was able to do that. Say it, derek. Maybe it's not one doctor. Maybe it's too many doctors... Who don't know each other And who don't trust each other. When I got to that room... There was chaos. Because that's the system now... Chaos. That has been the system That has been in place since this merger... Your system. I'm saying you should look again at who's responsible. And sometimes... The answer we get just confirms our worst fears.</i> But sometimes... It can shed new light on the problem...</i> Make you see it in a whole new way.</i> Hey, is she gone? Did she leave? You know what? She was good. She was a better doctor than I am. Just... Please shut up. You talk to April? No. - What? - Just waiting to see if you're gonna try to hit me again. I'm sorry. I was just, uh-- Forget it. Rough night, right? So April missed an airway ? - That's so stupid. - Airway first. It's, like, med school 101, right? It's pretty basic. (reed) it was one second. She got distracted and she made a mistake. - That we all nearly got fired for. - Nosedive's got a point. - Thank you. What? - We nearly got fired for trying to fix What she screwed up in the first place. Yeah, because that's our job. What, you didn't make any mistakes today? You've been distracted for the entire week. And who knows what you screwed up? But our patients didn't die, And that's why we didn't get caught. It could've happened to any one of us. After all the opinions have been heard...</i> - And every point of view has been considered... - Here she comes-.</i> You finally find... What you were after... The truth. But the truth isn't where it ends.</i> Thank god. I was beginning to think you went home And left me here to rot. Go home. That's it? Ready to go? Very. I've been waiting for bailey all night. That's just where you begin again...</i> You okay? Yeah. Let's go home.
