O'Malley? Yes, sir? You just flew solo. O'Malley plugs a hole with his finger, and everyone walks around like he's some kind of hero. - I have one off day. - You chickened out. - I hesitated briefly. - Why didn't you kiss Izzie? Cristina. - It's my first day back. - I'm not waiting forever. Okay, we're a couple. Whatever. Don't make a big deal about it. So pick me. Choose me. Love me. Derek, have you ever thought that even if I am Satan and an adulteress bitch that I still might be the love of your life? You're staying with her. Yeah, she's my wife. Communication-- it's the first thing we really learn in life... She didn't even know he was married. I mean, his wife just shows up and he dumps her. I heard she flipped out. What does she expect? She got what she deserved, dating an attending. Dating McDreamy. Have you seen his hair? No guy's that perfect. I think it's kind of sad. She has to work here-- with him, with them-- everyone knows. Funny thing is, once we grow up, learn our words and really start talking, the harder it becomes to know what to say or how to ask for what we really need. What do you need to,um, make this marriage work? I need her to move to Seattle. - That's just-- - Addison... What do you need? I need him to stop talking to Meredith. But I work with her. You want me to pick up my entire practice and move here, fine. I want you to give up your girlfriend. I did give up my girlfriend. Okay? You wanted me to take you back, I took you back here in Seattle. - See? Once again, it's all about what he wants. - She's not listening to me. I'm not gonna move back to Manhattan. - I am not the same person. - I know. - You're a flannel wearing, wood chopping fisherman. - Oh that's it. - I'm not gonna talk to her anymore if she's gonna behave like this. - Fine. Sorry, guys. Time's up. Good progress. Well, we have to do something. Meredith's become, like, an exhibit like the--hey-- like a zoo animal, like that rare panda that everyone stares at. Please don't say that to her face. I think that panda died alone. This could just as easily be you if people knew about you and... You take that back. No. I'm just sayin' we should do somethin' to cheer her up. Don't worry about it. It's under control. What--what do you guys have goin' on? - Nothing. - What? Where's Karev? Probably off somewhere not kissing somebody. Let's go O'Malley. Hey, so, um, after rounds, we have something to show you. - Mere? Meredith, can you hear us? - She's not deaf. - Well, she looks weird. - What do you expect? Derek didn't pick her. She's gone mental. Meredith, have you gone mental? - I have not gone mental. - See? Okay, she's fine. We have something to show you. So whatever you do, do not get assigned to a surgery this morning. It's really good. - Give it a chance, Derek. - I gave it a chance. He's a moron. Yeah, mind your own business. Mrs. Kimberly Griswold. A history of heart disease and multiple surgeries. In for a beating heart quadruple C.A.B.G. You're late. Yes, Karev, nice of you to join us. Why keep the heart beating, Doctor Yang? I don't know. - What? - What? I have no idea. Oh, I don't know, either. I just don't. Because of...ow. Anyone else? - Stress reduction because of the previous surgeries-- - O'Malley. - I know--I know the answer. - I'm asking O'Malley. Scar tissue's too deep. The heart's too weak to start up again, so you only immobilize the portion you're working on and you leave the rest of the heart on its own. - Welcome to the case. - Thank you. What is that? P.J.'s. That isn't fair, and you know it. He's punishing me for the elevator. He's punishing you because you were late for rounds. You wanna tell me why you were late? Dr. Shepherd needs somebody on his nerve case today. Go. And you three-- brush up on how not to embarrass me in front of the attendings or I'll see to it that your hearts stop beating. You clear? Sorry, Dr. Bailey. We really apologize. What is going on? We found a case. - You stole a case. - Borrowed from psych. Okay, the prelims--okay, this thing is totally unprecedented. And we found it. - Stole it. - Okay, found, stole, hijacked, whatever. Okay, Meredith, behind this door is the coolest medical mystery I have ever seen. Now you can either walk away, you know, guilt free... Or walk through this door, risk your place in the program, which could possibly lead to spending the rest of your life serving fries in bad clothing. So are you in? Hell, yeah. - Mr. Herman. - Oh, no. Please call me Shane. I gotta hit the can--again. Seems like I gotta go every 30 seconds these days. - Just a guy. - Wait for it. I sure am glad to be off that psych floor. - What's so special? - Wait for it. I'm not nuts. I'm just pregnant. I was fine, and then last month, unh. Huge belly. My doctor just kept tellin' me I was gainin' weight with my wife. She's due on the 30th. - It's our first. - Congratulations. The admitting intern shipped him off to psych. Barely did a physical. Hear that? It's not fluid. There's somethin' in there. Oh, yeah, no joke. There's somethin' in there. I've been able to feel it gettin' bigger and bigger growin' in my... you know... my womb. Yeah, I know I sound crazy. I do. But I can prove it. This room is supposed to be unoccupied. - Whose patient is this? - Hers. Who transferred him? I don't have any paperwork. - Any transfer documents. - Gimme a break. We shuffle rooms all the time. You know, if we need a bed pan changed, um, we'll let you know. Okay, Doctor, you do that. Okay, where's his chart? Don't tell me you don't have his chart. - You steal a patient-- - That was your job. Yeah, I was on lookout. How you doin'? You good? You look good. Come on. We're friends. What's my name? Um...all right. So I don't know your name. It's not like we can't talk. You don't have to be a surgeon for me to talk to you, you know. - Really? - Really. Because I thought you only talk to attendings. Uh, Nicole, you've been having problems with spasticity? Mom? She says the spasms make her legs dance. We just wanted to make things a little easier for her. She starts college this fall. Seattle community. Right down the street from us. Not that she wouldn't have her pick of schools out of state. But she's not ready for that yet. What, not because she's in a wheelchair? Has Dr. Ostfeld mentioned something called a cystoplasty? No? It's an operation to enlarge Nicole's bladder. It creates an opening called a stoma. It's improved the quality of life in a lot of my paralysis patients. We toyed with the idea a few years ago. It's not for us. Well, maybe we should revisit it. Revisit an invasive, risky procedure that's got a 20% failure rate, I don't think so? Nicole, it's something worth considering. It means you wouldn't have to wear the catheter all the time. Not to mention the medical benefits. It would, uh... improve your quality of life. You know? You'd be like girls your own age. You'd be in control of your own bladder. No messy bags. You could have a more normal sex life. Well, you know, when that becomes an issue, of course. We're here for the pain procedure. That's it. That girl and her mom share the same brain. She's not gettin' that surgery. I want you to take Nicole with you everywhere you go today. Take her to labs, take her to coffee, take her anywhere. Just get her away from her parents. You want me to babysit the wheelchair chick? Nicole. She thinks you're cute. She's a teenager, which means she might even listen to you. You want me to convince her to get that surgery. I want you to convince her to make the decision for herself. And how am I supposed to do that? Dr. Karev, you're creative. You'll think of something. Thank you. This will be an extensive operation even for an open heart veteran like yourself. My room was bigger last time. It was brighter--more sun. Alan, this water is warm. I need more ice. I'm sending you in for a nuclear scan. Then we'll get you into the O.R. this afternoon. You do understand all of the risks? I've been through it too many times to not understand the risks. Get the blinds. Open the blinds. This room is depressing. I'll check back a little later. Take her for the thallium scan and pick up her x-rays on the way. Dr. Burke, thank you for choosing me to assist you today. Well, you're my guy, O'Malley. - I am? I mean, yeah. - Hand me the tissues. No, no, wait. Hospitals have germs. Get my hand sanitizer out of my case. Why would you be with someone who makes you that unhappy? Excuse me? I mean, like, well, like, you're happy with Cristina. And she's happy--well, happier. You know, Cristina happy. Which is not normal people's happy, but... Well, you know, happy since you guys started, uh... Scans. I'm on it. I'm your guy... and I'm an idiot. Hi. Hello. Hi. Meredith. Maybe we could, you know, uh, talk. - No. - No. Okay. Beep, beep. - What'd you do to get stuck with me? - Nothing. Come on, I know you're not just wheeling me around for kicks. Well, I was late for rounds. Why? Oh, 'cause I had things to do. Hey, Izzie! Izzie! Hey, doll face. I was gonna ask you a favor, you know? I thought since, you know, maybe you're better with people than I am, -I thought maybe you could-- -No. -Uh, you haven't even heard-- -No, no. You're like a broken record. God. You're only ever nice or friendly or anything when it's convenient for you. So no to your favor. No to you. No. What's up with you? I put on a dress. I did my hair. I had one night off in two weeks and I used it on you. And what do I get? Nothing. No respect, no apology... you couldn't even be bothered to kiss me good night. You know what? You're a coward, and you're just as shallow as you seem. So I am done trying to be your friend or whatever. I'm over it. She's really mad at you. This urine sample is the last thing we need, Mr. Herman. Uh... - Meet Shane's wife Tina. - Hey. She's also pregnant. Can you tell us what precipitated the psychotic episode that got you admitted to the hospital? It wasn't an episode, okay? And I'm not psychotic. I am pregnant. I mean, wouldn't you freak out if you were me? Honey, did you bring it? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, good. I can prove to everyone that I'm not crazy. That is my patient! Yeah, well, he's ours now, and if you wanna fight me for it, I guarantee you I'll win. - What is going on in here? - Dr. Bailey, just one moment. Here. Please look at his abdomen. It's a male hysterical pregnancy. It's a psych case, and it's mine. It's not hysterical. I am pregnant. See? Psych. No, his belly is distended. There's no signs of ascites, and I clearly feel a mass with deep palpation-- - Surgical. - Guys. I told you I could prove it. - Psych. - Surgical. Come on, you're doctors, act like it. Guys. - Psych. - Surgical. Guys! Shane took a pregnancy test... and it's positive. Well, he's definitely a surgical patient now. Do not think for a moment I condone stealing patients. That said, way to go. The first pregnancy test I took... was a joke to make Tina laugh. Well, we didn't think it would lead to, you know, this. Mr. Herman, I can assure you, you are in no way pregnant. That's a relief--to hear it, you know, officially, but, hey, why was that stick blue? Well, that's what we're gonna find out. Uh, Stevens, do a shotgun workup including tumor markers and get C.T. to make some room for us in line. What's this for again? Uh, medical journals, monthly case reports. Annual banquet highlight reels. Hey, whose pager is that? Um, mine, but I found him. So can someone else go? No, we don't ignore pages, Yang. Would you excuse me? We just need to get to the top. We'll be finished soon, right, Dr. Bailey? We, um... Good. Okay. Patient in 4243 needs a rectal. Then I've got two infected wounds, a foley, a groin abscess, four debridements, and, uh... a case of explosive diarrhea. You're kidding me, right? I'm not known for my humor. Uh, why did you page me about-- none of these are my patients. You're Bailey's intern, right? Then these are your patients. Debbie here. A portion of the intestine is used to enlarge the bladder and then we construct a pathway to a hole in the belly button. It's a very tiny hole. It's virtually invisible. She could wear a bikini. No one would ever know. Why would she need a bikini? She doesn't know how to swim. She could go to the beach, lie in the sun, hang out with her friends. Oh, my god. She's so self-conscious now. Nicole could have friends her own age, Elaine. When did you say Nicole would be back? After her labs. Now just think about her future. Nicole could be independent. She could go to college anywhere. She could have a job, have her own apartment, date, get married. These labs are takin' a long time. She can spend more than 20 minutes away from us, Elaine. I'm asking about my only child. She's not a child anymore. She's my child. She'll always be my child. Alan, watch your step. - You're hitting my chair. - I'm sorry. - And hold onto my bag. - I got it. - And don't rummage through it. - I won't. "Please" and "thank yous" were never her strong suit. You're a very patient person. Years of practice. Oops. Oh, she won't see that. I just try to keep her calm. You know, they didn't think she was gonna survive the first surgery, let alone three more. But here it is ten years later, she's still here. Yeah, it's, uh, it's a miracle that she's still alive. That's what everyone says. What do you say? Uh, it's right there in the vows. In sickness and in health, right? Thanks. A pregnant guy? You had a pregnant guy, and you didn't tell me? Well, we can get you floor space in the O.R. for 50 bucks. You're selling tickets, and we don't even know what's wrong with him. Whatever he's got inside has got to come out. We're just brokering a few deals. Sort of like backstage passes. - You want in on the cash? - No. I didn't get a pregnant guy. I was Burke's new go-to guy, but that's over thanks to you. - He didn't know that I knew about you two. - Stop talking. What on earth? Hi. I'm Alex's charity case. Yeah, I like her already. - Are you volunteering? - Don't ask. Why? It's not like we can read your mind. It's not like we have any idea what's going on in your tiny, tiny, tiny little brain. She has a point. Oh! I am hungry! So this is cool. A real live lunchtime in a real cafeteria with trays and-- and friends. We're not his friends. Don't you have a cafeteria at your school? I'm homeschooled by my parents. That explains a lot. So are you guys the cool kids around here or something? What would make you think that? It seems like everyone's talking about you. The guys and I were takin' bets on who'd get to scan this dude. Beers are on me tonight. Next up, the wager on what this thing is. You're taking bets? On what's inside his belly. You want in? 10 bucks. Well, I know it's not fat, food or a fetus, so... Jeez. Are those teeth? Cristina's gonna be so mad she missed this. I was told to page you and only you if somethin' like this came up. Who told you, Bailey? - No. - Oh, yes, and all I can say is you must've made one serious faux pas. I hate vomit. You're gonna need this. Bailey knows. - Knows what? - She knows. O'Malley knows. - Why not Bailey? - So you didn't tell her? - Why would I do that? - This is bad. We have to manage the damage ourselves before this thing spins too far out of control, - and that means coming clean to the chief. - What? If we come out in the open, - then no one has anything to say. - No. No. No way. No way. - That's the only way. - Good morning. - Morning, chief. - Thank you, Dr. Burke. You're welcome. Ahem. Great board, chief. Would you make sure that they get the breathing tube out of my throat right after surgery this time? Are you trying to cut off my circulation? He's just doin' his job. What did you say? I said, "he's just doin' his job." Well, I don't really care whose job he's doing. He's squeezing my arm off. Are you just gonna sit there? Shut up, Kim. Just... shut up, huh? You complain to me, about me... around me all day... every day. A little silence would be nice. A few measly minutes of quiet. - Can't you for once... - Mr. Griswold. In your life... just shut up?! What do we got? She had a levine sign and her E.K.G. shows S.T. elevations in ****** She's havin' a heart attack. Give her 4 migs of morphine. Run nitro 10 mics per minute. Let's do this fast so we can get into surgery, people. Oh, I did this. I did this to her. Look, mesenteric teratoma, chief. In an adult male. Is this possible? It is now. Large bilobed cystic lesion... with a solid calcified structure. A deformed mandible. Labs show elevated H.C.G. levels. That explains the false positive on the pregnancy test. - Which also means... - It's probably malignant. You okay? You look a little green. I think he needs some air, chief. Deep breaths, Mr. Herman. Just--most of this medical speak goes right over my head. You have what's called a teratoma, and it's really very rare in adults. Which is why you're so popular. It's just a mass of cells that's probably been there your whole life, - only now-- - Now it's growing. Yeah, growing jawbones and toenails and, uh, clumps of hair. Yeah, I've been listenin'. It's just no one's really talking to us. Just about you. I know what that's like. Um, hi. What'd I miss? Ew, is that... is that rectal jelly on your scrubs? Dr. Bailey, all the attention, all the people are making them panic. You know, when you said you found a lunch spot with a view, I knew I should have taken you literally. I found it in my "best of Seattle" guide. It's hardly brown bagging it on the top of the Empire State Building, but... they did have these cute little viewfinders. You always find something to complain about. Okay, is there anything that you like about me anymore? Because if there is, I really need to know now. Well, I like that you like cute little viewfinders in every city you live in. I don't live here yet. Are you going to stop talking to Meredith? - I will. - When... Today, tomorrow, next week? Maybe I'm not ready yet. Are you ever gonna be ready, Derek? What if I say no? Then I'm not moving here. Then I guess we're at an impasse then. Dr. Yang... we never finished our conversation. Yes, we did. We decided we're not gonna tell you know who about us. Oh, we decided? If you're worried about your career and your reputation, they're in much more danger if he hears about us through the grapevine. - He doesn't have to hear about us at all. - Only he will. It's just a matter of time. Unless you're hesitating because of some-- some different reason. Okay, you are not thinking this through. Like you not wanting to admit to this relationship at all? We are a couple. - Fine. - Burke. I said, "fine." So what's up with you not wanting to get this procedure? I'm fine the way I am. Good point. Your choice. So you're not gonna try and talk me into it? Right now, I'm gonna study. "Nuclear something fancy name-ology." - Is that why you were late--you were studying? - No. - Is that girl Izzie your girlfriend? - No. Do you want her to be your girlfriend? Look, I got stuck with you because I was late for rounds. So if you don't mind, kid, I'm kinda busy. I'm 18, you know. What? I'm not a kid. I'm 18, and... and I don't have to stay down here with you. - I could go back to my room. - So go. Izzie's right. You're an ass. I'm not an ass. Okay, I am an ass... But I'm a cute ass, right? How come you didn't kiss her? I thought you were leaving. If I had a chance to kiss someone I liked, I wouldn't hesitate. If I had the chance to lose the urine bag around my ankle, I wouldn't hesitate, either. But then again, I don't let my mommy do all my talking for me. I don't like you. Yes, you do. - Jerk. - Motormouth. - Babysitter. - 2-wheeler. Now that's just politically incorrect. Looks like Mrs. Griswold is doin' well. Wait a minute... just a little suction. We'll fix the mechanical stabilizer later.</i> Right now I'm just gonna hit a few--a few of these little bleeders.</i> Look at that. A perfectly exposed, partially-numb beating heart. It's a beautiful thing. Code red! Oh my god. I think it just burst into flames. Her heart--it's on fire. We have to save Mrs. Griswold. - Begin fire protocol. - I'm on it. Code red! Begin fire protocol! - Move, people! - We need wet towels. - O'Malley, disconnect the electrical leads. - I got it. Let's go, rookie. Any unnecessary personnel in this room, evacuate now. Shut down the o2. Already on it. Start manual respiration. I've got the ambu bag. Starting manual respiration. We've got to control this bleeding. Her vitals are stabilizing. We might just have a chance here. She was on fire. I have never seen anything like that. What was that? It was a freak accident. - But she was on fire. - All right. You already said that. I know, but she was... on fire. George, you okay? She was on fire. That was intense. Are you okay, or... I'm fine. O'Malley, let's go. I'm so over this. Hey, I heard a heart caught on fire in the O.R. I am the best intern you've got, and you are wasting me on puke and boils, and I get it. I-- I even deserve it, but please, you can't keep me away from this surgery. I earned this surgery. I stole the surgery. What are you talkin' about, yang? You, punishing me. You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you? Well, then, like, who has been paging me all day? The nurses have been on me nonstop. A little bit of respect, and you could've saved yourself a very long day, Dr. Yang. Pissing off the nurses. Stupid. Well, I can still scrub in, right? He wants me to move here, Richard-- to pick up everything and move. Don't stay for him, Addison. Stay for me. Stay for yourself. - Richard, I-- - Look, in Seattle, you could be front page news. With your reputation and the money I'll put into promoting you, Seattle Grace will become one of the foremost neonatal hospitals west of Manhattan. You're serious. I'm ready to put my money where my mouth is. - Turn around. Walk away. - From who? From my intern. Well, I wasn't. Yeah--yeah. Yes, you were. Come on, look--look, you can't do this. You don't have the right. Not anymore. I just wanna find out if she's okay. No, she's not. She's a human traffic accident, and everybody's slowin' down to look at the wreckage. She's doin' the best she can with what she has left. Look, I know you can't see this because you're in it, but you can't help her now. You'll only make it worse. Walk away. Leave her to mend. Go on. It's not that I don't want the operation. I do, you know. I want things. It's just... what if I'm not ready? Ready for what? For everything-- for taking care of myself, for being on my own, for sex. For love. I've never had a boyfriend. I've never even been kissed. I'm, like, the oldest living prospective college freshman not to go to first base. It's mortifying. There are way older losers than you. Trust me. Alex... would you kiss me? Wh--what? I know you're a doctor, I'm your patient and it's against the rules, but I would never tell anyone. For a kiss to be really good, you want it to mean something. You want it to be with someone you can't get out of your head, so that when your lips finally touch, you feel it everywhere. A kiss so hot and so deep, you never wanna come up for air. You can't cheat your first kiss, Nicole. Trust me, you don't want to, 'cause when you find that right person, the first kiss... it's everything. - Her heart-- - Caught on fire. Yes. There will, of course, be an investigation, but you should know, this is not as unusual as it sounds. Your wife is going to be fine. She's well. Um, we completed the operation and I expect that she will make a full recovery. Mr. Griswold? So that's it, isn't it? Her heart caught on fire in the middle of her fifth open heart operation and she survived? Whoa. Well... she's like some, uh... some mythical monster. She's never gonna die! Uh, Mr. Griswold... Mr. Griswold. I know this is an emotional time for you. Um, if you'd like to wait... Wait? No, no. I'm not waiting any longer. You tell her... tell her...hell. Tell her she'll survive without me. We can add two more, standing room only. Hey, hands off. What is going on in here? Everybody out! - We already have-- - Out! Mr. Herman is a patient-- a surgical patient who's sick and embarrassed and tired of being stared at. You two--this isn't a zoo! Out! Out! Out! You know what? If all of you want to point and whisper and stare at me, knock yourselves out. "Look at Meredith. "Isn't she sad and pathetic and heartbroken? "Maybe she's gone mental." Maybe I have, but leave Mr. Herman alone. You should be ashamed of yourself. And what are you looking at? So--so do you tell his wife or should I? Heh heh. This is-- I... I want to thank you... for helpin' me out in the surgery today, O'Malley. It was a-a high pressure situation today, and you were on top of it. Well, thank you, Dr. Burke. And, hey, I'm sorry about before. About, you know, bringin' up, you know, you and Cristina. That... it's just like... You're still my guy, O'Malley. You're still my guy. I always thought I'd hold your hand in the delivery room. I'll let you know when the surgery's over, okay? Okay. This is as far as I go. Dr. Grey, don't let 'em show it off, you know... put it in a jar or pass it around or nothin'. Your teratoma? Yeah. I feel weird about havin' my insides on display like that. - You promise? - I promise. At the end of the day, there are some things you just can't help but talk about. You really wanna be the one to dispose of this, Grey? I made a promise. I am worried about my career-- I'm worried about my reputation and my-- I will not be Meredith Grey. I busted my ass to get here, and people won't make allowances for me. This is not about making allowances, and you know that. - Everyone will know. - That's the point. I don't want to tell the chief, okay? I just... don't. Some things we just don't want to hear... and some things we say because we can't be silent any longer. I'm getting the operation. - She's clearly not considering-- - She is considering. I'm getting the operation. You two talk and talk, but have you noticed how you never ask me anything? Part of it's my fault. I let you do it, but I'm not cheating anymore. I'm not sitting back and giving over control because... I am ready to handle things for myself. Some things are more than what you say... they're what you do. I appreciate your candor, Preston. I can take whatever you threw at Shepherd. I don't need any special treatment here. And you're not gonna get any. You're not married. You're not hiding. You came to me. You clearly value your relationship. What you two have together... I understand that, Preston, and it does matter. Some things you say because there's no other choice. I've given it a lot of consideration, and I've decided to move to Seattle. Mm, and, um, well, Meredith won't be an issue anymore. She's out of my life. It's-- well, it's taken care of. Well, I must say, this is, um, remarkable progress. I applaud both of you. You've, um, taken a very significant leap. That's what marriage is about...compromise, right? Yeah, it's, uh, well, it's about, um, give and take. Some things you keep to yourself. She yelled at you? Oh, we probably deserved it. We sold... $485 worth of tickets to the surgery. Yeah. Did you sell more? Oh, yeah. Out of control. Hey, Joe. Hey. So you guys really don't have anything else to talk about. No. And not too often... but every now and then... What? What? Some things simply speak for themselves. Good night.
