will be the best and worst. You'll be pushed to the breaking point. Eight of you will switch to an easier specialty. Five crack under pressure. Two of you will be asked to leave. We should pretend it never happened. What never happened? You sleeping with me, or you throwing me out? You're an attending, and I'm your intern. Stop looking at me like that. - Like what? - Like you've seen me naked. Your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours. You're interns, grunts, nobodies, bottom of the surgical food chain. What are you doing here? You and I are gonna have so much fun together. You know Meredith is inbred? Like it's uncommon here to be a doctor's parents. Her mother is Ellis Grey. Shut up. The Ellis Grey? She's a living legend. What's your name? It's me, Mom. Meredith. Oh, right. We're gonna survive this, right? [Tegan and Sara: You Wouldn't Like Me] [Meredith] It's all about lines. The finish line at the end of residency. Waiting in line for a chance at the operating table. [Tires screeching] And then there's the most important line, the line separating you from the people you work with. It doesn't help to get too familiar. To make friends. You need boundaries between you and the rest of the world. Other people are far too messy. It's all about lines. Drawing lines in the sand and praying like hell no one crosses them. I'm sure you're very nice, but I'm very particular about who lives in my house. You're just not right. Why? Look, I'm quiet. No loud music, no parties. Where were you when Challenger exploded? The what? The space shuttle. Challenger. Uh, I think I was in kindergarten. Exactly. No. [Lzzie] Why put up posters if you don't want roommates? I do want roommates. We're together 100 hours a week. You want to live together too? I see you bring bribes now. I need a place to live. My mom irons my scrubs. I have to get out of there. It's not a bribe. I don't think it's a good idea. - I can put down last... - It's totally a bribe. I can cook, and I'm an obsessive cleaner. [Meredith] No. I just want two total strangers who I don't have to talk to or be nice to. And it's not a bribe. It's a mocha latte. George, run the code team. Meredith, take the trauma pager. Cristina, deliver the labs to the patients. Izzie, you're on sutures. Dr. Bailey, I was hoping to assist you in the OR today. Maybe do a minor procedure. I think I'm ready. Mocha latte? [Cristina] If she gets to cut, I want to cut. - [Lzzie] Me too. - I wouldn't mind another shot. Stop talking. Every intern wants to perform their first surgery. That's not your job. Do you know what your job is? To make your resident happy. Do I look happy? No. Why? Because my interns are whiny. You know what will make me look happy? Having code team staffed, having the trauma pages answered, having the weekend labs delivered and having someone down in the pit doing the sutures. No one holds a scalpel till I'm so happy I'm Mary-freakin'-Poppins. Mocha latte, my ass. Why are y'all standing there? Move! Seattle has ferryboats. - Yes? - I didn't know that. I've been living here six weeks. I didn't know there were ferryboats. Seattle is surrounded by water on three sides. - Hence the ferryboats. - [Elevator bell dings] Now I have to like it here. I wasn't planning on liking it here. I'm from New York. I'm genetically engineered to dislike everywhere, except Manhattan. I have a thing for ferryboats. I'm not going out with you. Did I ask you to go out with me? Do you want to go out with me? I'm not dating you, and I'm definitely not sleeping with you again. - You're my boss. - I'm your boss's boss. You're my teacher and my teacher's teacher. And you're my teacher. "I'm your sister. I'm your daughter." - You're sexually harassing me. - I'm riding an elevator. Look, I'm drawing a line. The line is drawn. There's a big line. So, this line, is it imaginary, or do I need to get you a marker? [Dings] [Clears throat] We'll talk later? [Beeping] - Are you the surgeon? - Yeah. We've got a rape victim. Better get in there. [Woman] 25-year-old female found down at the park. Status: Post-trauma. She came in with a GCS of six. BP: 80 over 60. Exam is significant for blunt head trauma. Unequal breath sounds, right pupil is dilated. And she's ready for X-ray. Ready to roll? - Hey! - Yeah. Call ahead to clear CT. Let them know I'm coming. Load up the portable monitor. Call Respiratory for a ventilator. I'll get x-rays while I'm down there. She's going to spend a long time in recovery and rehab. If she survives. [Derek] Is she 5'2", 100 pounds? She's breathing after what this guy did? Catch the guy, they should castrate him. [Burke] See how shredded her hands are? - She tried to fight. - Tried? Rape kit came back negative. She kicked his ass. So we have a warrior among us, huh? [Chuckles] Allison. Her... her name is Allison. Allison. [Burke] I think I may have found the cause of our rupture. Large hemostat. [Burke] More suction. What is this? Does anyone know what this is? Oh, my God. What? Spit it out, Grey. - She bit it off. - Bit off what? That's h-his... ...penis. She bit off his... his penis. [Psapp: Nobody Knows] Ouch! If she can fight the infection, she'll be fine. It's all gonna depend on whether or not she wakes up in the next 72 hours. We should get a drink later. You can tell me the long story, what makes a doc leave the Big Apple for Seattle. Short story, actually. Your chief of surgery made me an offer I couldn't refuse. Richard asked you to come? Yeah. Why? Oh, nothing. See you later. Do you know what the code team does? Saves lives. I shock a heart, and someone lives to see another day. That's upbeat. It's, uh, glass half full. Bambi, don't say another word till after the hunter shoots your mother. I don't like you. I have a BA from Smith, a PhD from Berkeley and an MD from Stanford, and I'm delivering lab results. It will take all day to get through these. Then get started. Oh, I-I wasn't complaining. Intern was reassigned, so he's mine now. Have him shadow you for the day. Show him how I do things. Alex Karev. Nice to meet you. You're the pig who called Meredith a nurse. I hate you on principle. And you're the pushy, overbearing kiss-ass. I, uh, I hate you too. Oh, it should be fun then. [Pager beeping] I'm Dr. O'Malley. I'll be running this code. What do we got? [Man] We have a 57-year-old male. He's asystole. Charging to 200, please. - We're charged. - Cleared. All right, Mrs. Lu, I'm Dr. Stevens. I'm gonna sew up your wound. You're gonna need about six stitches. Are you allergic to any medication? [Speaking Chinese] Oh, I'm sorry. I-I don't... Do you speak English? [Speaking Chinese] I'll find, um... Does anybody here speak Chinese? [Knocks on door] Hi. Is the chief in? He's on his way. Is that it? - Yeah. - Can I see it? No. Forget I asked. Meredith, it's good to see you. I heard your mother was leaving Mayo. She going back with the UN? - She's, uh, taking time off. - To write another book, I suppose. So they said to bring this to you, so... - Yes, uh, for the police. - Right. When did the police say they were coming? You know how slow they are. She better take it with her. What? You have to take it with you. Chain-of-custody rules. All medical matter in a rape must stay with the person who collected it until it's placed in police custody. You collected the specimen, so you have custody. Custody of a penis. Yes, until the cops come for it. OK. Well, what am I supposed to do with the penis? [Cristina] You have a disorder called multinucleate cell angiohistiocytoma. It's not a cancer or sarcoma. It's very rare but minor. You'll be discharged today, OK? - I-I don't need a surgery? - No. I'm not gonna die? I'm fine? Fit as a fiddle, or whatever. [Sobbing] What's that? Don't ask. You don't want to know. I do want to know. Really. You really want to know? It's a severed penis. OK. I didn't really want to know. [Cristina] Why do I have to be the one who get hugged? [Alex] Because I don't do that. Besides, you're the ovarian sister here. Did you call me an ovarian s...? An ovarian s...? Since when has the possession of ovaries become an insult? Meredith's carrying a penis around in a jar. - Oh, from the rape surgery? - Yeah, and it's not a jar. It's a cooler. Talk about taking a bite out of crime. [Woman over PA] Wheelchair to Admitting. - You OK? - Yeah. - Allison's shoes are... - What? The rape victim, Allison, her shoes. I have the same ones in my locker, and I normally never wear them because they're not comfortable. But today I did. And she was wearing the same shoes, and it's just... stupid, and I'm tired, and forget it. You know what you need? No. It's sick and twisted. We said last time was the last time. You've been doing it without me? Nancy Reagan lied. You can't just say no. Come on. Do you know what would happen if anyone knew? I'm doing it. You can come with me, or you can stay here and be miserable. [Chuckles] [Cooing] [George talking gibberish] [Laughs] You are such a woman. - [Meredith clears throat] - [Pager beeping] That's a code. - [Pager beeping] - I got to go. [Sighs] You are really cute. [Crying] [Crying continues] [Cooing] What are you doing in here? There were no tests ordered, and the baby has a murmur. I know. He turned blue. You're not authorized to be in here. Do you know how much trouble you can get into? Are you going to do any tests? It's a benign systolic ejection murmur. It goes away with age. - You're not gonna do tests? - He's not your patient. - He's not even on your service. - You sure it's benign? I'm a doctor, too, you know. You should get out of here. [Speaking Chinese] - You get a good case? - No, her. She won't let me sew her up. [Speaking Chinese] I wouldn't have called you, but I can't get the translator. Can you just ask her what's wrong? - No. - Why not? Because I grew up in Beverly Hills. The only Chinese I know is from a Mr Chow's menu. Besides, I'm Korean. [Sighs] Chief. So, you asked Shepherd to come to Grace, huh? He was an old student of mine. He left a Manhattan private practice because you asked. - Yes. - No other reason? Just a favor for an old professor? Lt'll be years before I retire. Chief of Surgery is mine. Chief of Surgery is mine. It was yours. Now I'm not so sure. I am the best surgeon at Grace with the lowest mortality rate. You can't just bring... Now ask me why I'm not so sure about you. Ask me why. [Woman on PA] OB nurse to Labor and Delivery. Available OB nurse to Labor and Delivery. Don't people get sick anymore? I mean, how are we supposed to get any OR time if everyone's gonna just live? Look. I'll take ten, you take ten. Get in, get out. No smiling, no hugging, no letting them cry. - Just be quick about it. - You're the one that's slow. I am not slow. You are slow. - You want to bet? - You're on. [The Ditty Bops: Sister Kate] - A comprehensive workup... - Did not reveal... Your Doppler was negative. So there's no need for chronic anticoagulation. - [Cristina]... lBC... - [Alex] Biopsy was positive... ...for a mixed anaerobic... ...streptococci infection. Creatinine elevations had us worried... ...about glomerulonephritis... ...which could signal autoimmune disease. What does that mean? - We're not amputating your leg. - Huh? You keep your kidneys. Congratulations. You can go home today. Congratulations. Whatever. There's nothing wrong with you. You're going to be fine. Congratulations. [Beeping] [Meredith] What's your favorite '80s group? - Queen. - No. - Twisted Sister. - Oh! It's not like there's a right or wrong answer. The Go-Go's, Duran Duran, Eurythmics. - Have a nice day. - You can go home today. [Flatline tone] Time of death: 15:45. Meredith. I've called every hospital in the county. I don't know. Sooner or later, the guy that did this is gonna seek medical attention. When he does, that penis you're carrying is going to nail him. - Where is her family? - Doesn't have any. No siblings? No. Both parents are dead. She just moved to Seattle three weeks ago. Welcome to the city. Meredith, are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. I just have to do something. I have to go. All right. I'm going to sit with her. Dr. Burke? There's a baby up in Peds. I saw him have a tet spell, and I think I hear a murmur. Hmm. Did Peds call us for a consult? - No, they're not... - So, you want me to what? If you could just go up and look at him. Not without a Peds consult. I'm a busy man, Grey, and there are rules. Look, it's not like I'm the chief or something. [Exhales] You're hot. You're drunk. Hold still. Wait. You're that... that girl from the magazine. The red bikini. Yeah, it was pink. I'm done. You can see the nurse outside now. [Speaking Chinese] - Is she crazy or something? - No, I don't think so. OK. Please. Please sit down. I really need to look at your arm. OK. [Speaking Chinese] What are you doing down here? Just sitting here with my penis. - What about you? - Hiding from Alex. I kissed Derek. You kissed Derek? In the elevator. In the elevator? I was having a bad day. I am having a bad day. This is what do you do on your bad days, make out with Dr. McDreamy. Well, you know, that and carrying around a penis just makes everything seem so shiny and happy. George said Allison was wearing your shoes. Yeah. It's weird, right? It's weird that you care. - I think it's weird. - [Shouting] [Tires screeching] Could I have Security, please? What do we got? - Take a look. - What? Let's get him to OR 1. Call the chief. Let him know we got the rapist. I saw Allison. You can't believe the beating that she took. And then to see this. Like that saying, "You should see the other guy." Why not attempt to reattach the penis? Teeth don't slice. You can only reattach with a clean cut. If she wanted to slice him off with a knife... The digestive juices didn't leave much of the flesh. So, what do we do? Sew him up minus part of the family jewels. And his outlook? He'll be urinating out of a bag for a long time. Not to mention he'll never be able to have sex again. - Too bad. - Shame. Let's all take a moment to grieve. Clamp. Richard. We got the rapist. He stumbled right into the hospital. Yeah, I heard. - Listen, Burke... - Why? You really want to know? I want to know when you stopped thinking of me as your number one. Richard, I do more in this hospital than... You do only exactly as much as is necessary. You never take an extra step. You never give an extra minute. You're comfortable and arrogant, and it doesn't impress me. You want to be chief? Earn it. [Speaking Chinese] I'm sorry. I have patients lined up. I don't have time. I don't understand you. I'm sorry. [Woman on PA] Dr. Bailey to Ortho, stat. - My head hurts. - Maybe it's a tumor. You wish I had a tumor. I'd rip your face off if it meant I got to scrub in. I've been suturing all day. My hands are numb. At least you help people. At least you get to practice freakin' medicine. I had to send my Chinese lady away. She was, like, camped out down there. Oh, poor lzzie, turning away patients. Boohoo. The police can't send a crime-scene guy down for hours, so I have to spend the night with the penis. - Alex, don't say it. - It was too easy, anyway. [Sighs] Who here feels like they have no idea what they're doing? Are we supposed to be learning something? I don't feel like I'm learning anything. Except how not to sleep. It's like there's this wall. The attendings and the residents are over there being surgeons, and we're over here being... Suturing, code-running, lab-delivering penis minders. I hate being an intern. [Baby crying] - Hi. - Hi. - Is he yours? - Yeah. - He's adorable. - Thanks. Oh, please. You are so out of line. She says the murmur might not be benign. I think we should do an echo to check. This is your career. There really is no reason to get alarmed. What's the problem? If our baby is sick, we want him treated. - Now. - Who said your baby was sick? The surgical intern, who has no business on our service. Who authorized you? - I was just... - I did. Can you excuse us for a second? Dr. Burke. Are you messing with my intern, Dr. Kay? No, sir. Give me the chart. There's nothing wrong with him. I checked. - Are you sure? - Yes. You can guarantee he's fine? You're 100 percent sure? - How sure are you? - I don't know, 75 percent? Not good enough. He's my patient now. That OK with you, Dr. Kay? - Absolutely. - He can take our patient? He's an attending. Which means I can do whatever I want. Mr. And Mrs. Johnson, I'm Dr. Burke, head of Cardio. We're going to run some tests and give you an answer within the hour. - Grey. Excuse me. - Yes, Dr. Burke. I want an EKG, chest x-ray and an echo. - I don't have all day. - You're a busy man. I'm a busy man. - [Exhales] Anybody else? - No. No more. I need a bed. Ms. Lu? [Thunder rumbling] Ms. Lu! Ms. Lu, wait! Ms. Lu! What is it? [Speaking Chinese] Hello? [Sirens wailing in distance] Oh, my God. It's OK. It's OK. I'll help, OK? [Thunder crashes] It's deep. It's deep. I need to clean it out. Machine broke in the factory. - It fall. - You speak English. Just... If you could come inside. No, no, no inside. No... Jail. Jail? She came inside. She green card. Me, no. You're illegal. That's OK. We don't have to tell them that. I just need to get you inside. I have to sew... - No inside. - Please, I promise. I promise you won't go to jail. Just... It's raining. Please come inside. [Speaking Chinese] OK, OK, OK. Not inside. Uh... Wait here, OK? Wait. I'll come back. I'll be back. - Well? - It's a birth defect. Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. You were right. I'm booking the OR for tomorrow. Thank you for backing me up on this. Whoa. Wait. You were right. But if you ever pull a stunt like that again, going to the parents behind a doctor's back, trying to steal a patient from another service, I will make your residency here hell on Earth. [The Cardigans: Live and Learn] Three, four, five. Breathe. Charging to 200, please. Four, five. Breathe. Damn it. OK. You're all sewn up. That's pretty good. I could've done a better job if I'd had more light. You might have a scar. It is good. You're going to need to come back in five days. I'm going to need to check the wound and remove the stitches. OK? Here's my pager number on this card. Right here, OK? We'll meet right back here, OK? You have to come back. But you can't tell anybody that I helped you outside of the hospital, or I might lose my job. Understand? Yes. Come back and don't tell. Yes. OK, that's it. I'm done. You can go. I'll see you in five days. See you. [Speaking Chinese] Thank you. [Get Set Go: Wait] - Do you think I'm too confident? - No. Don't lie. You are my boss. All right, then. Anything you say in the next 30 seconds is free, starting now. I think you're cocky, arrogant, bossy and pushy. You also have a God complex. You never think about anybody but yourself. - But... - I have 22 more seconds. I'm not done. [Cristina] I need a drink, a man or a massage. Or a drunken massage by a man. What's wrong with you? I lost five patients on the code team today. I feel like the angel of death. George, 95 percent of all code patients can't be revived. Most of them are seriously dead before you even get there. What? Why didn't you tell me that when I was going on and on about how great it was going to be? Because... ...you're George and I'm Cristina. [Woman] His heart surgery is scheduled for the morning. I really did think I was right, you know? I know. We almost never are. We're interns. We're not supposed to be right. And when we are, it's completely shocking. Are you...? I mean, being an intern, do you feel...? Terrified. 100 percent of the time. Good. It's not just me. No. How is she? No change. - Have you been here all night? - Mm-hmm. Yep. You know, I have four sisters. Very girly. Tons of kids. If I was in a coma, they'd all be here. I'd want them here. Having no one? Can't imagine that. I can. What about your mother? She'd be here ordering all the surgeons around. She'd fly these cowboys in from Prague to do these amazing medical procedures. That's true. I do have my mother. So we're kissing, but we're not dating? I knew that was going to come up. Don't get me wrong. I like the kissing. I'm all for the kissing. More kissing, I say. - I have no idea what that was about. - Is it gonna happen again? Because if it is, I need to bring breath mints. - Put a condom in my wallet. - Shut up now. There's this baby up in the nursery. He's brand-new. No one's neglected him or damaged him yet. How do we get from there to here? She's wearing my shoes, and someone's beat the crap out of her. And she's got nobody. [Monitor beeping] Her ICP's doubled. Get OR! Prep for craniotomy. Let's hang a mannitol. Take a blood gas. [Woman over PA] Dr. Cutler to Thoracic surgery. Hey. I, uh, had to leave her skull flap off until the pressure in her brain goes down. She's not going to make it, is she? She's going to be fine. If she ever wakes up. If she ever wakes up. [Derek] Dr. Burke? I'm off at 6:00. You want to get that drink? - I don't think so. - What about tomorrow? Shepherd, you should know that Richard promised chief to both of us. But you knew that already. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. You're not the enemy. You're just the competition. So here is where you have the signature, and down here, the initials. OK. It just says that the, um... The... Penis. [Laughs] Look, I'm a doctor. I mean, it shouldn't be weird to say this. It's just that I used to change her diapers. I get it. It just says that it was never out of your sight. - One penis. - Yeah. Officer. [Burke] We'll use a median approach for a transventricular repair with a right ventriculotomy. Let's open him up. OK. Fifteen blade, please. - Grey? - Yes, sir? Go scrub in. When we're finished cracking the baby's chest, I'll let you hold the clamp. Seriously? Don't make me change my mind. I'm going. [Keane: Somewhere Only We Know] I have good news and bad news. Good news is Dr. Bailey stopped your bleeding. The bad news is we're giving your penis to the cops. Have a nice life. [Cristina] The results of your labs are clean. The tumor is benign. You can go home today. Oh, you... [Meredith] At some point, you have to make a decision. Boundaries don't keep other people out. They fence you in. Life is messy. That's how we're made. OK, fine, George and lzzie, you can move into the house. - Yes! - I can't believe you caved! Thank you. Yes! I can't believe I caved. I blame the babies. They make you toxic. [Meredith] So you can waste your life drawing lines... ...or you can live your life crossing them. Welcome back. [Meredith] But there are some lines... So, it's intense. This thing I have for ferryboats, I mean. [Meredith]... that are way too dangerous to cross. I'm so taking the stairs this time. No self-control. It's sad. Really. [Meredith] Here's what I know.
