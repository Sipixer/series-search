- Ellis Grey. - Meredith's mother. It's not that Burke broke up with me, it's how he broke up with me. Have you even bothered to tell Burke about the baby? Cristina! It was an extrauterine pregnancy. She's bleeding out. Stop talking to me like you're my boyfriend. Stop talking to me at all. If you came out here to try to win me back, you can forget about it. I just know I still love you. Hating you is the most exhausting. The key to surviving a surgical internship is denial. We deny that we're tired. We deny that we're scared. We deny how badly we wanna succeed. And most importantly, we deny that we're in denial. I don't know. When I left, Cristina said she was okay. Nobody goes through what she went through and is totally over it by now. Cristina can. She's fine. Too fine. She's cold. No, she's hard-core. She's got ice in her veins. She does what she has to to get through. She lost a baby. She lost a fallopian tube. And she's acting like she doesn't even care. She's all, "hello, I'm totally fine" person. I mean, she's my friend, too, but she's acting like she has no emotions or warmth, like she's missing a soul. - God, she is gonna make a great surgeon. - George. It's true. You show no weakness, you make it to the top. Some people just keep their feelings to themselves. We only see what we want to see and believe what we want to believe. And it works. We lie to ourselves so much that, after awhile, the lies start to seem like the truth. Meredith kissed me. Addison kissed me. My wife and my girlfriend kissed me on the same day. Joe... do I look friendly to you? Oh, you're a tiny little kitten of joy and love. - What? He saved my life. - His first mistake. Mcdreamy, go sit by someone who cares. We deny so much that we can't recognize the truth right in front of our faces. Everything's gonna be fine. Addison will go back to New York, Meredith and I will start over. Everything's gonna be fine, right? You so damn stupid. I want everyone focused today. With Cristina out, we're short an intern, and I have a feelin' it's gonna be one of those days. - And, Karev, see the chief by the end of the day. - What for? Do I look psychic to you? He's the chief. He asked, you go. What did he do now? Maybe he gave the chief syphilis. So we're in the middle of the belizean jungle, and this jaguarundi jumps out and bites one of the guides. They all look at me. They're yelling, "You're a doctor. Help him." This is one time a PHD does no good. I'm sorry. Did I miss the bell for social hour? - Tales of missionary life. - You're a missionary? No, my parents. - We traveled a lot. They still do. - Oh, wow. This stuff is great. - Um, this is Dr. Burke's patient-- Kalpana Vera. - Kalpana. Named by villagers in Nepal. Uh, she presents with multiple syncopal episodes - and ventricular arrhythmia. - So you've been passing out? Yeah, and having palpitations. Past medical history of rheumatic heart disease with mitral valve stenosis. They had to ship me from Zambia to the States for 3 months of treatment when I was 8. Rheumatic fever almost killed me. Dr. Stevens, what are the primary causes of ventricular arrhythmias? Valvular disease, mitral valve prolapse, stimulants, drugs  and metabolic abnormalities. - What? - Out. - I'm fine. - Out. You better be in your room by the time we round on you. - And when will that be? - In 15 seconds. 14... 13... - 12... 11... - Nice panties, Yang. In your dreams evil spawn. Cristina Yang. - Post-op, day three, from a unilateral salpingectomy-- - And ready to get back to work. Is she? I'm taking solids and my pain is controlled with oral meds. I'm ready. Didn't the nurse say this morning you had a fever? Mother. Cristina, did you have a fever? Temp spiked to 101 last night. Big deal. - She worked 2 shifts last month with a 102-degree flu. - Yes, exactly, George. Thank you. And we appreciate your dedication, but you're staying in bed until it normalizes. I keep telling her there's more to life than surgery and career. Mother, go upholster something. Look, I need you to relax, shut up and get better. You're a patient this week so you can be a doctor next week. Understand? Mere, come here. You cannot leave me alone with her. I am flying over the cuckoo's nest here. You have to save me. - You need time to heal. - I'm healed. I'm healed! Oh,  god. Okay, Dr. O'Malley, you're presenting. Okay, Dr. Grey is post-op, day three, from a tumor resection. - Wrong, wrong, wrong. - Sh-- He's got it all wrong. It's not asthma, it's gerd. He  needs a nissen fundoplication. I don't want her in the room. Mom. She's a child, and I won't have her on my team. We'll meet you outside, Dr. Grey. - You skipping rounds? - Avoiding mother. Meredith... - You've got a wife. - Yes. - Your life is complicated. - Yes. I don't need complicated. - I have complicated all on my own. - Yes. Stop saying yes. Try not to make any sudden movements. You think this is funny. Addison's leaving. She doesn't have any more patients in this hospital. There's no reason for her to be here. - No reason? - None whatsoever. Well, isn't this cozy? Can I join in, or are you not into threesomes? - I have to go. - Meredith... You really are Satan. You realize that, right? If Satan were to take physical form, he'd be you, - everywhere, all the time. - I am so not Satan. How come you haven't gotten on your broomstick and gone back to New York where you belong? - Stop being petty. - Stop being an adulterous bitch. You know you are going to forgive me eventually, right? I mean, you can't just-- I mean, there was a time where you thought of me as your best friend. There was a time where I thought you were the love of my life. Things change. Divorce papers. Your lawyer said they're okay. I haven't signed 'em yet. The ball's in your court. If you sign, I'll sign. I'll... sign and be on the first plane out of here. I'll sign them immediately. I want you out of here as soon as possible. Derek, have you ever thought that even if I am Satan and an adulterous bitch that I still might be the love of your life? Nobody knows where they might end up nobody knows... Oh, oh Suppose you'll never know. It's my chart. You're the patient, not the doctor. Act like one. It's been tough finding you alone. - Yeah. Well... - How are you doing? Well, you have my chart. You tell me. How are you doing? I'm fine. Perfectly okay. I had a right to know. - Well, now you do. - Cristina-- Look, now you know. It's over. There's nothing for you to deal with, so I don't know what else is there really left to say? - Plenty. For starters, you could've come to me-- - Oh, look, it's my mother. Dr. Preston Burke. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Yang. Actually, it's Rubenstein. Dr. Saul Rubenstein of Beverly Hills, the oral surgeon. I'm remarried. Been remarried since Cristina was, what, about 3? Mom, that's too much information. He has other things to do. You're good-looking. He's good-looking. Why don't you ever bring home a man as good-looking as him? - Stop. - What? - Stop talking. - Cristina! Forgive her. I don't know what I ever did to raise such an unpleasant girl. - Oh, me, unpl-- I'm unpleasant? - Excuse me. - Do you know who that was? - Who? That was my-- - that was my boss. - I was very nice to him. Why did you have to call my "unpleasant" in front of my boss? Lighten up, please. Okay, I was thinking that maybe we might wanna-- you might... - okay, we both have tonight off, so-- - You are so into me. Shut up. It's sad--the worship, the adoration. - And I'm so handsome, I intoxicate you. - Okay, you know what? Forget it. Izzie, would you like to go out with me tonight on a date? You wear something gorgeous, I pay for food. Are you making fun of me? I'm not making fun of you. Okay, then. G ood. Good. Thought I told you I never wanted to see you again. That's only because you're too lazy to learn anything more. Dr. Meredith Grey, Jeremiah Tate. Thinks he knows so much because he was one of my first patients as an intern. I  knew as much as she did. She was clueless about how to treat cystic fibrosis. A simple cholecystectomy turned into a month-long stay. You better not be alleging malpractice. Guy raises about 100 grand a year for cystic fibrosis runnin' triathlons thinks he's a big shot. - You run triathlons? - Why not? Pain, for one. It says here you're finally admittin' to feelin' a little. - A little. - How little? Truth. Well, enough to keep me awake at night. Had some seizures. Um... too weak to work out. Anyone been through here with your C.T. results? No. It's probably just my pancreatitis kicking up again. All right, then. We'll be back with your results and a plan. Where do your parents think you are this time? New Jersey. What about his parents? No, he doesn't like to bother them until he's well or about to get discharged. He understands his reality. He just chooses to ignore it. Denial works for him, Grey. "Abdominal pain". "Abdominal pain". "Perirectal abscess". "Gunshot wound to the head." What the hell is this G.S.W. to the head? Why wasn't the trauma team called? Hello? Are you people insane? There's your gunshot victim. Him? I'm redoing the living room in beige silks, I'm thinking. And modern. Very mid-century. - And the dining room-- - Mother, give me back my toes. Okay. I'll change the subject. Who's the father? Mid-century, did you say? Someone you work with, right? Or is it just for sex? You made such a point of not forming attachments. 20 minutes. Just gime-- All I want is 20 minutes of peace and quiet. The daughter I raised would appreciate her mother's help. The daughter you raised is begging for you to go now. I didn't have to come here. You know, I'm very busy. I know. Yeah, I know, redecorating your house. Well, can you get me a mocha latte, please? A non fat one. No, a fat one. Ah. Well, you're walking. You're talking. There's no exit wound. This mark here looks more like a burn. I'm telling you, I shot myself-- pulled the trigger while I was cleaning my .22. I thought the clip was out. If you're thinkin' suicide, don't. People make mistakes. I made a mistake... And now I'm payin' for it. But I did shoot myself. -  Where's your I.V.? - I'm taking solids. I hep-locked it. On whose orders? Mine. Okay. "Yang." How about this order? "Bed rest, out of bed to chair, bathroom privileges." Nothin' about stealing charts at the nurses' station. Okay, you know what? Hey, hey, hey! Give me that. Ah. Ah. There. Satisfied? I'm out of bed to chair. I'm telling your intern on you. - Meredith? - Yeah. Ooh, I'm so scared. Dr. Grey, how are you doin'? You're here. Good. I need the results of the barium esophagram or the E.G.D., and you have neither. Okay. No worries. I'll be here when you get back. So today, you're her intern, hmm? Well, that's better than bein' her husband. Well, that's a matter of opinion. Good morning, Ellis. Richard, good to see you. I need those labs immediately. Chief, um... she's not a surgical patient anymore, and I'd really like to get back to the O.R. So, uh, do you think I could hand her off to someone else? O'Malley, Alzheimer's causes her reality to shift, depending on the situation, her mood. She needs stability right now. That's why I'm depending on you to keep a special eye on her. Yes, I know, sir, but, you know, it doesn't seem fair to me. I need those studies yesterday. You heard the doctor. Get movin'. I saw that. I saw you take that pill. Oh, it's--it's my pill. You know, "the pill." It's, uh, it's not in your chart, and you're supposed to tell us all the meds you're on. You're not my doctor. You shouldn't even be here. She's right. You shouldn't be here. I saw her take unauthorized medication. I'm on the pill, and I had grapefruit juice this morning. Since the juice inhibits enzymes involved in the metabolism of O.C.Ps, I thought I'd avoid the interaction by taking it two hours after my meal. She is a doctor in neuropharmacology, Cristina. - Well, Izzie, I don't see oral contraceptives... - Guys. - Okay, well now you will. - Would you just go back to bed... Would you just go back to bed and stop poaching my patients? - She's in v-fib. - Call the code. Code blue, second floor. Code blue, second floor. - No code? - Not anymore. Can you help us get her back in the bed? I'll help. Just give me a minute. Would you just go back to bed, please? Seriously, go. Oh, god, you know, Izzie, if she's on O.C.Ps, then we mark it down, okay? Yeah. Jeremiah's got a mass in his mid-epigastrium, a diffused enlargement of the pancreas. - That, with his hypoglycemic seizures... - He's going to need an exploratory laparotomy... but despite his triathlons, his lungs still make me hesitant to cut. What are we going to do? I don't know that yet. Doctors. Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd. - How old is he? - He's 26. - Survivor, huh? - And then some. My patient for at least five years. I'm not going to lose him now. - You planning a laparotomy? - Yeah, but his lungs... You know what? I think I could help you with this. I've seen one case like this before in a 9-year-old. We ended up having to do a total pancreatectomy. I'd  be honored to take any help you could give me. You're a neonatal specialist. What--I--this isn't your area. I'm just saying. I-- I did two years genetics research in cystic fibrosis. - I've pretty much seen it all, Dr. Grey. - Oh. Just because she offered her services, doesn't mean she intends to stay. Well what does it mean? - Because it seems to me... - It means that she's a good doctor. Oh ho ho. Why are you suddenly defending her? I'm not. Meredith, she gave me divorce papers which she filed. Oh. Well, that's good. All I have to do is sign, and I'm free. We're free. Is there anything to think about? No, of course not. I have to read through them, sign, and then Addison's on the next plane out of here. You say he got shot in the head? He says he got shot in the head. I say he's a mental defect. Um, hi. - Ma'am, you can't be in here. - Yeah, I know. I'm looking for Samuel Linden. He... Oh, my god. Samuel. Well, how--how--how--how bad is it? - Are you his wife? - Yes, for 21 years. Just tell me how he is. Fine, for a man who says he shot himself. He shot himself. He was cleaning his gun. What is wrong with you people? We'll know everything when we finish his C.T. - This is a restricted area, ma'am. You have to leave. - No, no. My husband has a bullet in his head. Then we'll find it. If you could just wait outside, I'll be with you as soon as we know something. I promise. Of all the fine doctors in this city, you accept a consult from Addison Shepherd? Montgomery-Shepherd, isn't it? The point is that she should be on her way home. You're tryin' to drive me crazy, aren't you? - Oh, hey, now, don't do this. - Do you think this has somethin' to do with you? Do you think I'm even thinking about you and your romantic problems? I'm tryin' to help a patient very near and dear to my heart, and if consultin' with your wife, your ex, your mistress, whatever it is that she becomes, if that's the thing I have to do to save my patient, then I'm damn well gonna do it. I understand that. I deserve that. It's--come on, it's just... look, you have put yourself between two very fine women and you lookin' for an easy way out. You want to use me and the hospital-- somebody to make the decision for you, and it's not gonna happen. Could I just-- - could I just say a couple things? - Just--deh, deh, deh. You scared us a little there. How's her workup coming? Uh, electrolytes are within normal limits, urine tox was negative and E.K.G.'s fine. Tilt test is scheduled for noon. - Oh, and she's on contraceptives. - So? That's what I said. That other doctor made such a big deal of it. Well, she didn't tell us before. So I documented it in her med list. What other doctor? Cristina. She was wandering the halls. Fine. Take her down for an echo. An echo? What about cardioversion or ablation? Won't I need a pacemaker or a permanent internal defibrillator? Although it would be unusual for rheumatic heart disease to cause ventricular dysrhythmias, we've still got to check your valves. I thought your doctorate was in neuropharmacology, not medicine. It is. Addison gave Derek divorce papers, which is good. I mean, she's still here being Addison, but it's not like I'm jealous or anything. That's odd. It's odd that I'm not jealous? No, you have every right to be jealous. It's your territory, and she's peeing all over it. What's odd is Burke's patient. She's been in four other hospitals this year. You know, something's not right. You seem awfully interested in Burke's patient. This has nothing to do with Burke. Cristina, you lost a fallopian tube, a baby and a boyfriend all in one day. You have the right to be upset. And you're losing McDreamy to his perfect wife. You have a right to be jealous. I did not lose McDreamy. Divorce papers, remember? - And I'm not jealous. - And I'm not upset. You really should be in your room. Okay, if the situation was reversed, would you want to spend time with your mother in a confined room with one window? Do you think we're like them, our mothers? Dr. James... - Uh, where's your mom? - Exactly. Where is my mother? Where's your mother? Funny you should ask. Oh, crap. Oh, man, you are not gonna believe this. No. It can't be. The guy was readin' a freakin' magazine. It's definitely a bullet, one that tracked clear through his head. Now are you people just going to sit here, or are you going to get him into surgery? Here's the missile track. As you can see, it doesn't even cross the midline. He's lucky. This guy may have even been sitting there talking to you. He'll need debridement of the entrance wound and repair the dura, but we don't need to remove the bullet. That's an excellent diagnosis, Dr. Grey. I'm Dr. Shepherd. I'm your neuro consult. Dr. Grey... they need you upstairs. You'll book the O.R. and stat? I'm on it. - Unbelievable. - O'Malley. Can you not handle this, Doctor? I can't handle a lot of things. We won't know for sure until we go in there, but it looks like that I'm gonna have to take out your pancreas and reroute your intestines. Did you tell her that my lungs don't do well with anesthesia? Don't I always have your back? Your kidney function is decreasing rapidly, and I'm afraid you're gonna go into multisystem organ failure if we don't operate. If I say no? There's no guarantees, Jeremiah. You know that. It's going to be a long, hard surgery and put a lot of stress on your body. Yeah, but I'm me. But you're you. So if we don't operate, I die, and if we do operate, I may die. Basically, yes. Well, I like those odds. And 26 years with this disease is awesome, and that's the reality. So if I get lucky... great, and if I don't... It's been sweet. It's going to stay sweet. You understand, we'll need to do a psych evaluation? How many times do we have to tell you? He wasn't trying to kill himself. It was an accident. They're just trying to do their job, hon. Well, no. Their job is to make you better. Where were you when the gun went off? I was in the next room, and I heard the shot and it was awful. It's over now. Why didn't you call 9-1-1? 'Cause he was only unconscious for a moment, and then-- then he was--he was walking and talking and... - We're going to have to give a report to the police. - The police? What--what do we need to talk to the police about? We have to report any gunshot wounds to the police. It's the law. You're officially A.W.O.L., you know. I'm working, trying to figure out what's going on with the crazy woman in four. You are the crazy woman on four. I made a break for freedom. Will you hand me that dictionary? Unh. You have a better patient than me, and you don't even have a patient. Meredith's got a C.F. case, Alex has got the gunshot wound, Izzie's got the mystery arrhythmias. I'm not a nanny. I'm a surgeon, a cutter. But, no. I'm gettin' fake labs for fake patients so she can do a fake surgery. She's faking it. It's real to her. It's Alzheimer's. The missionary. Kalpana. Oh. God. Oh. Thank you. Ow. Uncalled for. - Hey, Izzie, how have her studies been? - Hey, I have been looking for that everywhere. Negative, right? Oh, the echo tests showed mild mitral stenosis. The tilt test was negative. We're doing E.P. studies. I can tell you what's wrong with her without sticking electrodes in her heart. Really? Just by the chart. No, from the pill she took. They were contraceptives, Cristina. Why are you so obsessed with this? Just go back to bed. I think she's doing this to herself. You think she's inducing ventricular arrhythmias? She'd have to be crazy to do that. No, no, no, no. She'd have to have Munchausen's. Okay, wait. You think she's secretly ingesting something to produce real symptoms? Seriously? Yep. Just run it by Burke and tell me what he thinks. Tell him yourself. He's standin' right behind you. Dr. Burke. Where are we? O.R. 2 in 30 minutes. He's prepped. Transpo's on the way. Do you understand that? 21 years. What's that all about? I love you, okay? I forgive you. You cheated on me. You cheated on me, - and you do not get to play the martyr here. - I got a bullet in my head. - And that doesn't make us even. - You shot me. I think we need to get the police up here right now. I mean, she obviously loves the patient role. I mean, she practically lives in hospitals. And--and we're like an imaginary family to her because her real family blows her off to go take care of other people, and I saw her take something. It's not enough. We have to rule out everything else, everything physical. She even lied about her job. She's a pharmacy tech, not a PHD. So she's a liar. I've been lied to before. Hey, we're not talking about us here. Maybe we should be. - I didn't lie. - You withheld the truth. - How do I know-- - Okay, you know what? I distinctly remember you breaking things off with me, and you didn't seem so upset about it. Okay, this--this is not-- this is not a relationship. - This is not real. - Cristina. Okay, and--and so what's with the big, fake display of hurt and drama? - Cristina. - I'm supposed to be in bed. Cristina. Officers, thanks for coming. Ma'am, why don't you have a seat? We need to ask you a few questions. Oh, um, of course. Well, nothing like a domestic dispute to liven up a pre-op, huh? Where do I sign? Here for consent... and here for D.N.R. and no extraordinary measures. Good. Okay, lift up for me. Ow. You should probably call my parents. Call 'em yourself when you walk out of here. Dr. Grey, I have those labs... oh, no, you didn't. You lost her again? Again? I am a surgeon. A surgeon. Yeah, well, you won't be when Dr. Webber finds out you lost Ellis Grey again. We're using three different catheters. Why are we doin' that, Dr. Stevens? Programmed electrical stimulation maps the heart's electrical system - to find the focus of the irregular-- - Um, Doctors? - Sorry to interrupt. - Yes. Her urine's blue. What? Why is her urine blue? - She says she has a surgery scheduled with Dr. Shepherd. - I turned my back for five minutes. Why did you turn your back at all? I told you to take care of her. Just get out of here. You want to find a hot surgery, then find one. You're free. I'll take care of her. This is one sick bastard. Should flip him over and give him a spine. Pull back on the retractor, Dr. Karev. A little suction? Covering for his wife after she shot him. He did cheat on her. Yeah, and that guilt's worth a bullet in the head? Relationships are built on sacrifice. Not that kind of sacrifice. Mm, I don't know. Sometimes, the bullet's worth it. Oh, Richard. I thought you'd never get here. Look, the O.R.'s empty. I have a little time before my surgery. I don't think I'm supposed to be here. No. No, you're not. Come on. I'll take you back to your room. I need more traction, Dr. Grey. Here. Give me some suction there. Now, Grey, retract the duodenum. Good. How's he doin'? Harder to ventilate. No urine output since we started. He's shutting down. Did you increase his peak pressures? Any higher, it'll blow his lungs. Bradycardia. Pushing 1 of atropine. Try ventilating him manually see if he starts coming back up. Did we miss any bleeders? The surgical field is clear. Agonal rhythm. Any pulse with that? No carotid. Okay, starting C.P.R. Push 1 of epi. No extraordinary measures, Dr. Bailey. He's D.N.R. This is just good medicine. Blue urine? A second drug screen was positive for amitriptyline. Which, I'm sure you know, causes ventricular arrhythmias. You knew it wouldn't show up on a routine drug screen, but I'm guessing you didn't realize it would turn your urine blue. I didn't do this to myself. You have to believe me. I'm sick. I'm sick. - I have something-- - No. You're just deceiving yourself... manufacturing things that really aren't there, seeing only what you want to see... wasting our time, our resources and throwin' away your own life. Your illness is in your head, Kalpana. We will be transferring you to psych. Come on. Come on, don't give up. Come on. You're getting tired. Let me take over, Dr. Bailey. Dr. Bailey, his intestines are cyanotic. There is no blood circulating. It's being shunted to his brain where he needs it. You call those compressions? 1, 2, 3... Fight it. Come on. Why isn't anyone moving? Who's recording? It's been ten minutes since we've had a perfusing rhythm. It's your call, Dr. Bailey. Asystole. Time of death--19:26. It's hard to accept the end when you're too close. Look. I don't want someone who doesn't want me, Meredith, but if there's the slightest chance that he does... I'm not leaving Seattle. What'd she tell 'em? That you cheated on her, that she was drunk, you were cleaning your guns in the kitchen. - I'm not gonna press charges. - It doesn't matter. She confessed. Assault in the first degree. They arrested her? Man, you should be grateful. You know what I am? I'm stupid. Nothin' would make you feel more stupid than cheating on the woman you love. You don't know what you're missin'. Your latte is by your bed, and I'm pretty sure it's cold. I don't need it. - You should be in bed. - Stop it. I'm fine, okay? My brain is fine, my body's fine, I'm fine. I don't know why I came. Then why did you? You know, I'm-- you know, just stop it. I don't--I'm sorry I'm not that person. I'm sorry I don't--I don't need you here taking care of me. Well? You were right. Kalpana definitely suffers from Munchausen's. See? I was right. I was right. I was right. I was right. I was... right. I was right. Oh, I was--I was... I was right. I was... I'm right. I'm... You took the clinical skills section of your medical board exams after most interns. So the results are only now coming out. I got a call from U.S.M.L.E. this morning. Oh. So you're-- you're saying... Karev, you're still an M.D. You still get to practice medicine. The hospital grants you four months to retake the exam. You study it, you pass it, you put it behind you. One misstep doesn't affect your career. Yeah. Right, right, right. Thanks. Thanks. What happens, uh, if I--if I take the exam for a second time and I don't pass? You will no longer be a surgical resident at Seattle Grace. Failing again is not an option. What's going on? I can't stop. I can't. - I can't stop. - Crying. - She can't stop crying. - I can see that. - What did you guys do to her? - Nothing. She's going to dehydrate. Cristina, do you want some water? No. No. No. - No! - No! I already tried that. It just made it worse. I knew she'd break sooner or later. Just a matter of time. I will kill her! I am her mother. We don't do well with mothers here. Why don't you leave and come back later? Cristina. Make--make it stop. Make it stop. Somebody sedate me! Sometimes, reality has a way of sneaking up and biting us in the ass... and when the dam bursts, all you can do is swim. The world of pretend is a cage, not a cocoon. We can only lie to ourselves for so long. We are tired. We are scared. Denying it doesn't change the truth. Hi. M-Mrs. Tate? It's Miranda. Miranda Bailey. I'm calling about Jeremiah. I'm so sorry. She doesn't want to be touched. Shh, shh...
