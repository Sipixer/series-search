we're going to be great.</i> And from the day we decide to be surgeons,</i> we are filled with expectation--</i> Expectations of the trails we will blaze,</i> the people we will help, the difference we will make...</i> Great expectations of who we will be,</i> where we will go. And then, we get there. Meredith, - would you like seconds? - I'm great. Maybe Cristina would like some. Cristina, would you like some? I only made enough for three. You just said there was seconds. This is, uh, awkward. You know, we can go, and you two can talk. - We're talking. - We're talking. To each other. You're enjoying your meal at the international house of silence? Burke, you have to feed Cristina. She doesn't cook, and she will starve to death. I have cereal. You two live together. Someone has to be the first to speak. I am giving a-- A dinner party. If she wants to sit there, she can sit there. Let's just enjoy our evening and talk about something else. I heard a crazy rumor today, from one of the scrub nurses, that Richard was retiring. Mm. That's an interesting rumor. What? It's true? Richard's gonna name a new chief of surgery? He asked Burke. But Burke took himself out of the running, which apparently is my fault, for being a part of the team. He asked you? Who wants dessert? It's so sad. She's not talking to him. He's not talking to her. He said that when he retired, I would become Chief. No, no, no, no, no. - He asks Burke. - I don't think they're gonna make it. He said to me : "Shep, you're my man". Not Burke. How can two people be in a relationship and not talk? I am supposed to be Chief. George, can I come in? I made you some cookies, some brownies, some muffins, of course-- I always make muffins. Oh, thank god you're here. I can't take anymore. Three times already tonight, And he's getting ready for a fourth. - I-- - Are-- Are you talking about-- Oh. Oh, ew. You know, I'd get it if he were crying or depress, and I know we all deal with it different ways, but this is not grieving, this is my legs being bent In ways my legs do not go. And I know. I know his dad died. I get it. I feel horrible for him. But ow, ow, okay? I'm gonna give you guys some privacy. - Yeah, I'm going far, far-- - No, you stay. You take over for me, okay? - Callie Torres! - No, I don't-- Not like that. I am giving him to you. You are now officially on George watch 2007, okay? You are his friend. Yay! And I need a break. - I need to heal. I need to heal. - No, no. - I need... - But what am I supposed to-- Callie. - Thank you. Good-Bye. - No. Callie. What is taking you so... Uh, she... she had to go. Are you hungry? Hey. Dr. Karev. Hello. What's wrong with you? Me? No, I'm good. I'm good. I'm all good, all... good. - You've been avoiding me for a week. - No. No, I have not. Okay, fine. Forget it. I kissed Karev. George has become a sex machine. George has turned into a sex machine. Are you hearing me? A machine of sex. We have to do something. What's wrong with you people? Derek kept me up all night with his ranting. Cristina and Burke still are not speaking to each other. Oh, you know what? I'm fine. I mean, I'm just not gonna be the first one talking. I mean, he has to talk 'cause I'm in the right. Talking first is for losers. - I'm winning. - And Alex-- I don't know what's wrong with Alex. I'm good. I'm all good. Let me just remind you that I'm still recovering from the death of my fianc√©, the demise of my surgical career, the fact that I was forced to deposit an $8-Million check. That I was saving for a good cause even though I haven't found a good cause, and I'm the only one here under care of a shrink. I could blow any minute. Now george's dad has died. It has turned him into a sex machine. I'm gonna need a little help with that, so one of you better pull it together. Hey, anyone seen Callie? I kinda need to find her for something. Last I heard, perpetual sex was not one of the five stages of grief. - But denial is. - That's not what I'm do-- You shouldn't be listening at other people's doors. You were in the hallway naked. I saw you. Oh, I blocked that out. Denial. Dr. Montgomery. Is sex another form of denial? What? What do you know? That... That you have a G.Y.N. patient in here. That you want us to see. That's right. That's right. I do. Shall we? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Chief! - Chief! - Chief. I gotta talk to the Chief. - Well, so do I, and I was here first. I have a meeting to get to, - a very important meeting. - I'll talk quickly. Get in, too, Shep, if you can make it fast. Mine's not fast. Mine is epic. Then we'll have to talk later. Why are you wearing a tie? And why are you smiling like that? You have the length of this elevator ride, Miranda. Use it well. I have two words for you, Chief-- Free clinic. What? I want Seattle Grace to open a Free Clinic. - I know, it's a big undertaking, but-- - This isn't even surgical. I've done all the research. Miranda, there's all kind of hoops to jump through-- Funding, you have to get the Department heads to okay it. Well, if I get the support, will you consider this? I'll think about it. I can't imagine why you want to take this on. You're a surgeon. I gotta get to my meeting now, okay? Your chart says you've been having some pain and bleeding? - She has, for weeks. - It's not a big deal. I had to drag her in here. On our one day off from the restaurant. Just let the doctors check you out. A lot of doctors. She needs three people for a pap smear? Actually, it's not a pap smear. It's a pelvic exam. And since this is a teaching hospital, I was going to have one of the interns, do the exam, but if you're uncomfortable with that... No, it's fine. I'm helping you guys learn something, right? Okay, Stevens. Okay, Jilly, I'm just gonna, uh, warm the speculum for comfort. So if you'll just relax your knees... You don't have to stay here, if you-- Of course I'm staying. We do everything together. We might as well do this. Rachel and I were born two days apart. That's nice that your friendship has stayed so strong. Cradle to grave, right? Cradle to grave. So just relax this muscle for me. You're gonna feel the speculum. Dr. Montgomery. Okay, uh... - Jilly-- - Wait. He didn't get to look. I don't have to. You said this was a teaching hospital. He should learn. Dr. O'Malley. Okay, what do you have up there? Is she pregnant? - Oh, my god. If you're pregnant-- - No. I'm not pregnant. Am I? No. I could see the tumor, with my naked eye, I could see the tumor. I've never seen a cervical tumor that large. Does she have cancer? It-It'll take hours to get the biopsy results back. If she has cancer, I need you to tell me, because if you tell me in front of her, I'll start to cry, and when I cry, she cries. If she has family, parents, you should call them. You should call them now. It's just, her... parents, we... left home. We both left home when we were 16, and we haven't been back. We don't... speak to them. It's-- It's-- It's complicated. It's just, Jilly, um... In situations like these, she might change her mind. She might want her family. I am her family. She is... my family. I'm not contacting her parents, and neither are you. Jim, annoying interns. Annoying interns, Jim. Jim is semicomatose and has stage III decubitus ulcers. Bedsores? Right. So he's gonna need to be debrided, have his dressings changed, and be repositioned every two hours. Every two hours? By the time we finish, we'll just have to start again. I'm crying on the inside Can't the nurses help? They could but... I like nurses. They're helpful and smart and, already good at their jobs. So as a going away gift to them, I'm gonna let you hang with Jim while I go do one last rhinoplasty at Seattle Grace. I do like to leave a city just a little prettier than when I came. Did he just say he was leaving, as in quitting? - Dr. Shepherd. - Dr. Bailey. How was your meeting with the Chief? Uh, that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. There's a project I'm trying to get off the ground. I'd like to open a Free Clinic. Why? Because I want to, and I could use your support. Ah, see, that kind of project Requires logistical strategic and administrative components, something the Chief does. Apparently I'm not cut out for that kind of work. So... you're gonna have to take it to somebody else. How's George? Dealing, I guess. Oh, well, he sure has a voracious appetite. You know, some people bake, others eat. No, no, no. I don't mean that appetite. I mean the other appetite. Uh, we are not friends. You and I are not friends. So please don't talk to me about what - George eats. - Okay, I was just concerned, And I thought you'd be concerned. But you know what? Forget it. I don't like you. Now my feelings are hurt. Steve Beck, age 32, right patellar dislocation secondary to a fall while running a marathon. The paramedics told me I blacked out. Any theories as to how Mr. Beck here could've passed out? Uh, no sign of head injury. His B.P. was low in the field. 80 over 60. Athletes have low B.P's. Well, in that case, it's probably dehydration. I drank a lot along the way. Now, what else did you do today? Ate a couple of protein bars, took a couple aspirin for this cold I'm fighting. I've got another race next month-- Oh, god! All right, put him in a patellar brace, get postreduction films And run some labs. Make sure he's not too dehydrated. And, steve, next time you have a cold, you might wanna skip the race Never. You gonna be okay with this, - working on a cancer case? - Yeah. Why? Because of your dad. Callie! Hey! Hi. Uh, sorry. Uh, busy. Izzie. - Is she avoiding me? What are you-- - Maybe, I don't know. Um, but I'm here, if you want to talk. I know you're sad. I don't want to talk about that. George, I'm your best friend. I'm trying to help you. Why are you making this about you? It's not about me. It's about me wanting to talk about you needing so much sex, your girlfriend's vagina is broken. - Puritans. - I'm not a puritan. Izzie. Look out! Do you need some help? Pardon? Our daughter is here somewhere. What's her name? We'll look her up for you. J-Jillian miller. Jilly. Don't worry, if this is really something serious, I'll switch my shifts at the restaurant. Maybe... do nights instead of days. Mom? Dad? Hello, Jilly. What are-- What are you doing here? You called her parents? I told you not to. No, I didn't. It's okay, Rach. She meant well. They can't talk to you, remember? Right. I'm shunned. You can't give an inch, can you? You and these rules. Jilly, uh, I have your test results. I'm sorry. You are... My parents. It is... it is cancer. We'll have to perform a radical hysterectomy. Surgery? - It's okay, Rach. - But how does-- How did it get this bad? - Jilly doesn't want you here, okay? - Rachel, it's okay. - No, it's not. - But it's-- They are just here to make you go home with them. Is that what you want? Do you want to go back there? Mom, dad... you should go. - But you're having surgery. - I know, but... You coming... was a mistake. Please go home. You're quitting? As soon as I find the Chief and hand him my letter of resignation. Why? I hate it here. I hate the town. I hate the weather. I hate the people. They're mean. They're unforgiving. The people of Seattle are unforgiving, or Derek and Addison? What's your point? What about your contract? My non-binding verbal agreement with Richard? Yeah, I'm breaking that. Well, it's not as if he's gonna be around to enforce it, so... What do you mean? Well, the rumor has it he's stepping down. The Chief? - Well, who's gonna take his place? - What do you care? You're leaving anyway. When Richard asked you to come out here, what did he use for bait? He told me that I would have the foremost neonatal unit west of Manhattan. Okay. He didn't say anything about being Chief. - Why? What do you know? - Nothing. I know what you know. You're lying. - Dr. Montgomery. - Uh, I'm busy now, Karev. When you get a minute, I'd like to talk about the kissing. Who'd you piss off? - Sloan. - Oh, nice. You got anything good? Not even a fracture. You think a guy passes out while running, I'd at least get a fracture. Anyone available to assist me on a truncus arteriosus surgery? - Yeah. - Yes, absolutely. Good, then the first one of you to accurately describe the condition will scrub in. No one knows the answer? That's too bad. It'll probably be years before we see another one like this. Oh, well. It's a single arterial trunk coming from the ventricles. - How could you not know that? - How could you not say it? I'm sorry you had to find out about that Chief thing that way. You mean after the fact? Not the first time. I couldn't go to anybody about my hand. I didn't know who I could trust. I was stuck. Yeah. Well, now you're not. Hand's all better. You can operate. You can even run for chief. Life is all good again. Well, I'm not gonna try for chief. I'm looking for... answers. Well, the chief asked you once already. I don't see why he wouldn't ask you again. Look, I couldn't take the job. It wouldn't be... It wouldn't be... right. Well, whether something's right or not. Doesn't seem to matter much in this place. Well, your labs show that you're significantly dehydrated, and your muscles are breaking down a bit. We just want to make sure that the fluids help get everything back to normal before we send you home. But my knee's gonna be okay, right? 'Cause I blew this race. I gotta win the next one. Your X-ray looks fine. Your knee should be okay in about three weeks. You might want to try some P.T. It's pretty sore. The knee? - Yeah, my calves, too. - Oh. Uh, well, maybe-- Your brace is probably a little too tight. You've got extreme swelling in both legs. Uh, get Torres, now. - What the hell happened? - He was complaining of leg pain. Please, can't you make it stop?! - I can't find a pulse. - All right, open a cutdown tray. Gloves. All right, listen, I need you to do everything that I don exactly as I do it, all right? Steve, listen to me, this is gonna hurt, but if you want to keep your legs, I need you to hold them still. All right? Can you do that? Okay, hold his legs. All right. Follow my lead. His kidneys are failing. Why in the hell is this progressing so rapidly? - Damn it. - What? The aspirin. Because of the marathon and the dehydration, His muscles are breaking down, and the aspirin's accelerating the process. His whole system's crashing. The toxins in his body are going to kill him. I need to put in a dialysis catheter under fluoro. Let's get this man to an O.R. Now, people. You want to go grab lunch? Oh, yeah... I was actually hoping I could grab lunch with Callie. - Have you seen her? - No, but-- I think I'm gonna page her. - George. - Izzie. Look. They're still here. They're her family. Where else are they gonna go? Actually, I'm gonna find Callie. - Dr. Montgomery. - Now's not a good time. Karev! - Karev, listen to me-- - No, you listen. You kissed me, right? You kissed me, and ever since, you've been avoiding me. - Alex-- - No, you have been avoiding me because you just assume that I want you. You just expect that everyone you look at sideways is pining after you, right? Has it even occurred to you that maybe I'm not interested? You're not interested? You think I want to be just another intern sleeping with an attending? You kissed me back. You're my boss. I mean, what'd you expect me to do? Look, Sloan's had me changing bandages all day, and I would way rather be scrubbing in on one of your surgeries, and if you keep avoiding me, then I don't get to scrub in. So stop avoiding me. It happened. But it doesn't have to happen again. All right. All right. Rumor has it you're headed back to New York. - Where'd you hear that? - Good news travels fast. Actually, I was gonna ask you to scrub in on a peripheral nerve reconstruction but, - since it's your last day-- - It isn't, and I'd love to. - What? But I thought-- - Well, I was going, but now I'm not. Rumor has it there's a race for Chief. Where'd you hear that? Good news travels fast. Especially when you have a chatty girlfriend, anyway... See you at the finish line. Have you done that before? Slice a guy's legs open while he's awake? No. Impressive. You, too. Not that we're, uh, friends or anything. So you said I should be concerned... about George. He doesn't-- He doesn't talk about his dad. We don't-- We don't talk about anything, really. He just-- Talking's overrated. Oh, so you and Burke still aren't, uh... George told me. Well, see, you talked about that. Yeah, a week ago. If this keeps up, you and burke might be the very last thing we ever talk about. So what's the last thing you and burke talked about? Silence is overrated. Where's Rachel? She went to go make some phone calls, try to get her shifts covered. You know, Jilly, um... your parents are still here. They are? And I'm not the one who called them. Yeah. You called them, right? And I'm guessing they had to fly in from somewhere. So... you called them, what, yesterday, the day before? I went to an E.R. A while ago. And they told me to see an oncologist. But... I couldn't afford my rent, let alone pay a bunch of medical bills. But... Then I got scared. You called your parents. I didn't know what else to do. You sent them away because... Rachel's my best friend. And... And after she was baptized, she decided to leave the community, which means she's shunned. But... I couldn't just let her go out in the world all by herself. So you're shunned, too? No, because I hadn't been baptized yet. So I could still go back. - But Rachel would never-- - Do you want to go back? I think about it. It's my home, you know? And if I'm dying... I want an amish funeral. I want to be... buried in the white dress, and I want everybody to be there. It's your home. But... I made a promise to Rachel. Cradle to grave. How did Jilly let it get this far? It's frustrating, isn't it? And it's entirely preventable. And treatable, if you catch it in time, but you gotta catch it. Which is why I want to open a clinic. If she had had access to a Free Clinic, she probably would've had a pap smear every year and, wouldn't be dealing with infertility and premature menopause, at the tender age of 23. - You want to open a Free Clinic? - At Seattle Grace? Why? Illness caught early means fewer unnecessary surgeries, fewer unnecessary deaths. But I mean, why? Because. And if I can get the support that I'm looking for-- I need suction. Oh, no. My god. What? The tumor's invaded through the cervix and into the bladder. Which means she is a stage IV. Well, we're not doing this operation today. We've got to close her up. There's nothing more we can do here. O'Malley? His dad. How far'd he run before his body had the good sense to pass out? 12 miles. You've got to be out of your mind. Well, he couldn't have expected a head cold and a couple of aspirin to do him in. He probably felt dizzy miles before he passed out. He should've stopped, sat his ass down. He was in it to win. I understand that. You can, can you? Well, surgery is the most competitive field in medicine. We're all here to win. It's a long road, Dr. Yang, When you get to the end of it, you're not gonna care about winning. You're just gonna be relieved that you made it to the finish line. You told Sloan? - What? - Mark Sloan. You told him the Chief was stepping down, that I wanted the job. I didn't know that was a secret. He was leaving, Meredith. He was leaving town. - Okay, and now he's not? - No, he's not. You gave him a reason to stay. Derek. The commitment I'm asking for, is only a few hours a week. I'm sorry, but I can't deal with any more distractions right now. You owe me. - What? - When you had that tremor, you cut me out of surgery. After surgery made me feel like I was the one who couldn't do her job. You made me doubt myself. You owe me this. You need someone who can provide leadership, Direction to the project. I'm not that man. Not anymore. That's what you want to believe. Over the next few months, Jilly's gonna go through a lot-- Radiation, chimo. It's likely her... condition will get worse, a lot worse. And she's gonna need a lot of help. Okay, um... Um, well, can you give me some names of-- of doctors and medications? 'Cause I wanna be ready. I wanna... know everything so I can do this-- Do this right for her. Rachel... You can't... be everything. It's too hard. Jilly has parents who love her. They-- They love her, and they're here, and she wants to go home. - No, she doesn't. - She called them, not me. Jilly called? Jilly is dying. But I promised her. Cradle to grave. She's... Jilly, I love her. It's possible that The very best thing that you can do for her if you love her, is let her go. - Are you waiting to see the Chief? - Yes. You ? Yeah. About? Uh, oh, you know, just, admin stuff. Yeah, me, too. - What are you doing here? - We're waiting to see the chief. - You too? - Yes, Derek, - both of us. - You're unbelievable. I'm unbelievable? The chief steps down, And you automatically assume it's between you and burke? - You think he's gonna pick you? - Well, I think the fact that he hasn't tapped either one of you, yet means that he... - he has another candidate in mind. - What? no one invited me to the party? Chief! - I have an appointment! - Chief! - I've been trying... - I called Patricia. - I have an appointment. - No! - I have an appointment. - I-- Stop, stop, stop. One at the time here. You. What's all this about? They all wanna be Chief. And for the record, so do I. Oh, you want to be chief Just because we want to be.</i> All right, button it. All of you. I have had... A perfect day. I went to the board this morning and told them I was retiring, I saved a life, and now I'm off to see my wife. It has been a perfect day until you four fools tried to ruin it. A man can't be happy he's retiring around here, Not with you vultures trying to pick my bones. Chief... you steppin' down? As soon as they find a replacement for me, I'm stepping down as chief of surgery. But I don't know when that'll be, cecause at this point, I don't see any front-runners. Excuse me. Chief, that's not true... You didn't think of maybe tell me this morning ? That you were planning to step down, Instead of sending me on this wild goose chase? Dr. Bailey, you need those clowns To sign off on your proposal because one of them maybe Chief of surgery in a month. It's hard to imagine, for me more than anyone, but since you're not ready for the job... One of them's gonna have to Do it for the next few years. Me? It's you in the chair, eventually. That's who you are. But you're gonna have to get a new chair because you're short. You have short legs. But someday you are gonna be Chief of surgery. I wasn't sending you on a wild goose chase. I was trying to get you in the habit of doing things without me. - He's really doing it. - Mmh. He's really retiring. One of us could be Chief. No. One of us could be chief. You? I don't think so. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, I could be Chief. You're delusional. Mark Sloan, Chief of surgery. That makes me vomit a little in my mouth. These are your letters of support, for my Free Clinic. - Sign them. - Why do you want this clinic so badly? You're a surgeon. Because I need something more. I know you all have your messy love lives and your, secrets and your silliness, but I want more. I need something to hold on to. I need a reason to believe that medicine can do more than stitch you up, and-- and send you away. I need to believe that medicine can not only save lives, but-- But change lives. I need to... I need... I need to believe in something the way I used to believe in you all. Sign the papers. - Sign the papers. - You still need funding. The nazi's back. Hi. Go home. Rach... They're your parents, and you love them, and they're still here. You know what a big deal it is, for them to get on a plane. Go home, Jilly. But... - I can't just leave you here. - Yes, you can. - Rachel-- - You can go back home. And you can put on your bonnet, and you can get in the buggy, and go to church, get baptized. You can die amish. - No, I can't do that. - Why? 'Cause you'll have to shun me? Don't worry about me. I will be living it up here, with your curling iron and your cable TV, and your entire dvd collection. I'll be okay, here in the 21st century. I can't shun you. You can. And you will. And I won't take no for an answer. Now, say hello to your parents. Hi. - Jilly. - Hi. Jilly. Dad. I will tell your parents that I saw you, and you are well and happy, and have grown into a fine woman. Richard. What are you doing here? These are for you. Richard, what are you doing here? I did it, Adele. I retired. And I gotta tell you, I didn't Think I wanted to do it, but... I'm relieved. I'm happy. But when I told you I didn't have any more time to wait, - I meant it. - I know you did, - which is why-- - That was months ago. Months ago, I said, "you are out of time with me". Adele... is there a man in my house? I'm so sorry, Richard. But, what did you expect? I'm sorry. Why? I'm angry... What's wrong with having a lot of sex - if it makes me feel better? - Do you... feel better? You know how you felt... when you were lying on the bathroom floor? Maybe you're not supposed to feel better. Iz, you can't help me. I know you want to. But you can't. You can't help me. I have to let you go. Yeah. Just one last thing. Life is short, George. Life is short, And it sucks a lot of the time. If being with Callie makes you happy, Then go be with Callie. Hey, he gonna be okay? I think so. How's your clinic going? I got my signatures, Which is a start. The Seattle Grace Free Clinic will exist. "The Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic". What? I have $8 million. Izzie Stevens... You left without me. Now you're not talking to me. I was a jerk. Sometimes, boyfriends can be jerks. That doesn't mean you stop talking to them. You get that I'm saying "I'm sorry", right? You yelled at me for no reason, and then you walked away, and now you show up here. Of course I showed up. Why wouldn't I? - You don't trust me? - I do. Okay, well, this is how it works-- You fight sometimes, and somebody apologizes. Well, how am I supposed to know that? You've never done this before. No, I've never done this before. Okay. All right. Well, this is... From now on, you can expect that I'm gonna show up, even if I yell, even if you yell. I'm always gonna show up. Okay? Okay. You are gonna make an excellent chief. We all think we're going to be great.</i> Yeah. And we feel a little bit robbed when our expectations aren't met.</i> Karev. I've got an ovarian torsion that needs emergent surgery. You want in? Yeah. But sometimes, our expectations sell us short. I was right. I swear, I really believe what I did was right. I-I don't want you to forgive me. Frankly, I'd... I'd find it patronizing if you did, because while I know I was right, you think I'm wrong... which doesn't matter. Because... I'm in this. I'm in this for the long haul, and I'm in this to finish the race. So if that means, I don't win this one, then fine, I don't win. You win. I'm talking. See? I'm talking first. You win. Sometimes the expected, simply pales in comparison to the unexpected.</i> Marry me. I don't want to waste another minute. I can't have sex with you again, George. Okay? I can't. I just-- I-- Enough with the sex. Since my dad died, I feel like, uh... someone ripped out my stomach, filled the hole with asphalt. And I laugh every time that I remember I'm never gonna talk to him again, because it just sounds like the stupidest thing I've ever heard. I can't believe it's real. But... every time I look at you... I feel better. It shocks me. It knocks my wind out, but it's true. And I don't have to have sex with you. I'm happy just to look at you from across the room. And even that-- Anything, any piece of you... I mean, hopefully all of you. That'd be the best thing... because I love you. George... Marry me. Will you marry me? Marry me, Cristina Yang. You gotta wonder why we cling to our expectations.</i> Because the expected is... just what keeps us steady, standing, still. Marry me. The expected's just the beginning. The unexpected... is what changes our lives.
