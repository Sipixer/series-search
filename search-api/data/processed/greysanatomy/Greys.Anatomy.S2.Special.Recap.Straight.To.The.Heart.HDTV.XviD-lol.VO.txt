all of them pretty smart, all of them very driven and all of them just maybe a little scared. Of course, it's not always about the medicine. Ugh! You have to go. I'm late. Which isn't what you wanna be on your first day of work, so... so, uh, you actually live here? You know what? We don't have to do the thing. Oh. We can do anything you want. No, the thing... exchange the details, pretend we care. Good-bye... uh... derek. Derek. Right. Meredith. Bye, derek. The seven years you spend here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst of your life. You will be pushed to the breaking point. Look around you. Say hello to your competition. Only 6 women out of 20. Yeah. I hear one of them is a model. Seriously, that's gonna help with the respect thing? You're cristina, right? Which resident are you assigned to? I've got bailey. The nazi? Me, too. You got the nazi? So did i? At least we'll be tortured together, right? I'm george. O'malley. Uh, we met at the, uh, at the mixer. You had on a black dress with a slit up the side and strappy sandals and... now you think i'm gay. Uh, no, i'm not gay. Uh-huh. It's... it's just that, uh... (miranda) o'malley, yang, grey, stevens. That's the nazi? (george) i thought the nazi would be a guy. I thought the nazi would be... a nazi. Maybe it's professional jealousy. Maybe she's brilliant and they call her a nazi because they're jealous. Maybe she's nice. Let me guess, you're the model. Hi, i'm isobel stevens, but everyone calls me izzie. Rule number one, don't bother sucking up. I already hate you. That's not gonna change. Your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours. You're interns, grunts, nobodies, bottom of the surgical food chain. You run labs, write orders, work every second night until you drop and don't complain. No one holds a scalpel till i'm so happy i'm mary freakin' poppins. If you make your resident look bad, she'll torture you until you beg for your mama. Now get out there and don't let me catch you fighting over patients. Stop. No. Oh, mine. No, i saw him first. What? Katie's parents have questions. Do you talk to them or do i ask burke? No, burke's off the case. Katie belongs to the new attending now... dr. Shepherd.He's over there. Unfortunately, on your first day, the surprises aren't always going to be... surgical. Meredith, could i talk to you for a second? Actually, i was... i'm not the girl in the bar anymore, and you're not the guy. You took advantage of me and now you want to forget about it. I did not take... i was drunk, vulnerable and good-looking, and you took advantage. Okay, i was the one who was drunk, and you are not that good-looking. Maybe not today. Last night? Last night i was very good-looking. I had my red shirt on, my good-looking shirt. You took advantage. I did not take advantage. You wanna take advantage again, say friday night? Stop looking at me like that. Like what? Like you've seen me naked. (preston) Good afternoon, interns. As you know, the honor of performing the first surgery is reserved for the intern that shows the most promise. George o'malley. Me? Congratulations. (man) he's gonna faint. He's a fainter. Nah, code brown, right in his pants. He's all about the flop sweat, gonna sweat himself unsterile. 10 bucks says he messes up the mcburney. $15 says he cries. I'll put $20 on a total meltdown. $50 says he pulls the whole thing off. That's one of us down there, the first one of us. Where's your loyalty? $75 says he can't even i.d. The appendix. I'll take that action. Okay, o'malley, let's see what you can do. (george) scalpel. (woman) scalpel. (cheering) (man) o'malley! (preston) let's invert the stump into the cecum and simultaneously pull up on the purse strings. But be careful not to... break them. Oh, man. You ripped the cecum. Get out of the way! Pansy-ass idiot. Get him out of here. He's 007. (man) 007, yeah. (man) Yep, a total 007. What's 007 mean? Licensed to kill. Maybe i should've gone into geriatrics. No one minds when you kill an old person. Geriatrics is for freaks who live with their mothers and never have sex. I have gotta get my own place. I'll work with you, but i don't want in on the surgery. You can have it. Are you kidding? It's the biggest opportunity any intern will ever get. I don't want to spend any more time with shepherd than i have to. What do you have against shepherd? You can't comment, make a face or react in any way. We had sex. Dr. Shepherd, you said that you'd pick someone to scrub in if we helped? Oh, yes, right. Um, i'm sorry i can't take you both, but it's gonna be a full house. Meredith, i'll see you in o.r. Oh, screw you. I don't get picked for surgeries 'cause i slept with my boss. There is a reason we don't sleep with the attendings. It's not her fault, He's the attending. He should know better. He's taking advantage of her. What is your problem? Um, you. 'Cause apparently you can help dr. Mcdreamy in ways the rest of us can't. You can't do me favors. Okay. I can take care of myself. Look, i'm not being seen with you in this hospital. Think of it as an attending getting to know one of his interns. He slept with the intern. Barely knew her. And it should stay that way. You want me to be professional? Nice talking to you, dr. Grey. (izzie) why do you put up posters for roommates if you don't want roommates? I do want roommates. We're together 100 hours a week. You wanna live together, too? My mom irons my scrubs. I have to get out of there. I can cook and i'm an obsessive cleaner. Look, i'm sure you're very nice, but i'm very particular about who lives in my house and you're just not right. Look, i'm quiet... no loud music, no parties. Where were you when the "challenger" exploded? The what? Exactly. No. Okay, fine, george and izzie, you can move into the house. Yes! I can't believe she caved! Aah! George's room is bigger than mine. I got here first. It's meredith's house.She should decide. I'm not riding in the same car with him. Unless you're going like that, you're not riding with me. Where are the tampons? He didn't buy them. You didn't buy them? I am a man! I don't buy girl products. I don't want you walking in while i'm in the shower, and i don't want to see you in your underwear. Do you like izzie? Is that what this is about? Do you have a crush on izzie? N... izzie, no? I don't like izzie. She's not the one i'm attracted to. Not the one?So there's a one? This is not... you know, you're not the only one to put things off. I mean, i never do anything till the last possible minute. Like what? I've had this thing for my roommate since, like, day one, and i just... i can't tell her. You know, she probably wouldn't go out with me anyway, but how do know that for sure if i don't ever ask? Seriously? You're equating your pathetic love life with my record-breaking tumor? Seriously? After dealing with all that life and death, where does a doctor go to unwind? They come to see me at my bar, right across the street from the hospital. I know that look. Can only be one of two things... either your boss is giving you hell or your boyfriend is. Which is it? My boyfriend is my boss. This one is on the house. I'm not going out with you, i'm not dating you, and i'm definitely not sleeping with you again. You're my boss. I'm your boss' boss. Look, i'm drawing a line. The line is drawn. So this line... is it imaginary or do i need to get you a marker? male, 55, victim of a head-on collision. Mistakes... they happen. And imagine what happens with doctors who aren't that experienced. Just one more reason i'm glad i'm a bartender. (meredith) i popped a glove. (preston) what? I think i may have nicked her heart. Your ass is on the line here, dr. Grey. You've done this before, right? Of course. Millions of times. 2 of ativan. He started seizing. How much sodium did you give him? 100 cc over 4 hours. Actually, doctor, you ordered 500 cc per hour over 4 hours. Why didn't you do a follow-up? I gave you one thing to do. Karev, it's over, it's done. You screwed up. Deal with it. We stole a body. The thing about being dead is people stop looking for you. You brought a textbook? Yeah. Okay, got it. You sure? It's not like we can kill him twice. Don't even tell me you're doin' what i think you're doin'. Who here feels like they have no idea what they're doing? Morning, dr. Model. Dr. Evil spawn. Ooh, nice tat. They airbrush that out for the catalogues? I don't know. What do they do for the 6-6-6 on your skull? I'd know you anywhere. You're the spitting image of your mother. (cristina)you know meredith is inbred? Like it's uncommon around here to be a doctor whose parents are doctors? No, really inbred.Her mother is ellis grey. Shut up. "the" ellis grey? Who's ellis grey? El... the grey method? Where'd you go to med school, mexico? She was one of the first big chick surgeons. I mean, she practically invented the abdominal retractor. She's a living legend. She won the harper-avery, twice. Well, the ellis grey i know didn't have regards for anyone except ellis grey. But you know that already, don't you? Where is she now? Traveling. Traveling? Yeah. Huh. So we're kissing, but we're not dating? I have no idea what that was about. Is it gonna happen again? 'Cause if it is, i need to bring breath mints, (whispers) put a condom in my wallet. Shut up now. Well, well, well. Dr. Bethany whisper. That's so nice. Thank you. What? It's the chase, isn't it? What? The thrill of the chase. I've been wondering to myself, why are you so hell-bent on getting me to go out with you? You know you're my boss, you know it's against the rules, you know i keep saying no. It's the chase. But it's fun, isn't it? Izzie. George. Le... stop. (whistling and cheering) Shh. Shh. Shh. (whispers) we have bethany whisper in our locker room. (normal voice) oh, boy, i guess they do, uh, airbrush out the tattoo, don't they? Fine. Let's look at that tattoo up close and personal, shall we? And what are these? Oh, my g! Breasts. Gather around and check out the booty that put izzie stevens through med school. You want to call me dr. Model? That's fine. Just remember that while you're sitting on 200 grand of student loans, i'm out of debt. Go! (cristina) come on. Let's bag her. Push epi and atropine. Somebody page burke. One and two and three... breathe. She's d.n.r. One, two, three... she's d.n.r. Do not resuscitate. Dr. Yang. Come on, people. Push another... do not resuscitate. All right! It is on her chart. All right! Let her go down. Yea-ye... let her go down. We have to let her go. Just coffee. It's not the chase. What? You and me... it is not the thrill of the chase. It's not a game. It's... (meredith) i'm still not going out with you. Listen to me. What? You should probably sneak inside now. We've done enough sneaking for the night. It was good sneaking, but enough sneaking. Yeah, i'd say we're pretty good sneakers. You mind moving this tail wagon? You're blocking me in. Late night, grey? And while we're on the subject, you care to tell me what you think you're doing? Look, i'll jump through hoops if you want me to, but what i do when i leave this hospital is my business. Half this hospital knows your business. I made a choice, and i know you don't respect me for that choice, so whatever else you got, bring it on. (all) eww! Thanks for the coffee. (Iranda) hey, there's a new surgical case coming up from the pit. Let's go. (ellis) watch it! Hands off me! I could report you to the chief, and you'd be out on your ass! (cristina) Patient's name is, uh... where is the chief? Complaining of intermittent cramping, pain and diarrhea. Also suffers from... alzheimer's. (miranda) patient's name? Um... come on, yang. The patient's name. What the hell are you doing here? Ellis grey. (george) meredith's mother. George, take care of dr. Grey. Yes. She needs a friend right now. Oh, you mean ellis, the... mother. Dr. Grey. Goddamn it, thatcher. I'm at work. I've already told you, i'm too busy to deal with you now. No more cartoons. Darling, i'm not in the mood to play doctor now. Hands off. I'm busy. Damn it, thatch, i mean it. No! Who's thatch? My dad. Funny, you... you do look a bit like thatcher. But... i look like meredith's dad? It looks like you'll be able to go home today, ellis. You should know, i'm thinking of leaving thatcher. I'll leave him, you leave adele. Why don't you get her meds ready for discharge, nurse? Thank you. Ellis... that was a long time ago, remember? We had this discussion 21 years ago. Think about it, richard. We should make the break now. We could end up at opposite ends of the country. It'll be too late. And if old flames aren't enough of a problem, there's always new flames to deal with. It's just that i hardly know anything about you. You know i'm from new york, you know i like ferry boats. Enough with the ferry boats. What about your friends? I'm a surgeon. I don't have friends. What are your grandparents names? I don't have grandparents. Where did you grow up? What's your favorite flavor of ice cream? What is your problem? We're having sex every night. I think i deserve details. And until i get them, my pants are staying on. Or you could just roll with it, be flexible, see what happens. I'm not flexible. Ah, there, i disagree. We'll find these things out. That's the fun part, you know? That's the gravy. You're using up my oxygen, o'malley. How does a pompous, cocky jackass like you always have women all over him? O'malley... you think too much. Can't you see it? You gotta dance and jab. Dance and jab. Like me. I am the ali of this place. Smooth moves, doctor. I kicked ass. This, uh, is george. George has a hot date. It's kind of located in a, you know, a private... you're a doctor, george. It's called a penis. You have a rash on your penis? So? Dude, you've got syphilis. Are you sure you know what you're doing? It's a shot of penicillin, george. Be grateful i'm even doing this. I've already seen more of you than i ever wanted to. I cannot believe this. Meredith, go away! Oh, george. I'm indisposed here. George, it's not a big deal. And you have a cute butt. (alex) be my guest. Wh... alex? Hey. Ah, what are we doing here? Breaking george's spirit. Mr. Franklin's procedure's been scheduled for after lu... what?! Oh, what are we doing? We are saving george from a future of festering sores and insanity. Hmm. Cute butt. Told ya. It is cute, like a baby's. (cristina) mm-hmm. You know, i have spent hours, days, years, imagining myself half naked in a room with three women. The reality is so much better. Where are we? Shh. I'm gonna tell you. All right, my mother's maiden name... maloney. I have four sisters. I have, um, nine nieces, five nephews. I like coffee ice cream, and i live in that trailer. So that's it. That's all you've earned for now. The rest, you're just... just gonna have to take on faith. I really needed that. Thanks. Is this, uh... should we talk about this? (sighs) yeah, definitely. When we started dating, i was already kind of seeing someone. I didn't know how much i'd like you, and when i realized, i broke it off with the other guy and... other guy? Who's the other guy? You and alex? You and alex? You gave me syphilis! (meredith) george! (cristina) george! Meredith, i am so sorry. Hi, i'm addison shepherd. Shepherd? And you must be the woman who's been screwing my husband? Just wait. We should discuss this. Here's a thought... no. Quit following me. At least let me explain. Explain? You know when you should've explained? The night we met in the bar, before any of the rest of it. I know how you feel. Do you? Somehow i doubt that, because if you did, you would shut up and you would turn around and go back inside because you would realize that i am this close to getting in my car and running you down in the parking lot! If you came out here to try to win me back, you can forget about it. I did. I flew all the way across the country to reminisce over wedding photos, get drunk, fall into bed and ma you realize you can't live without me. Relax. I'm here for work. Here's the thing about hospitals and the people who work in them, the complications are not just surgical. Let's play a game of whose life sucks the most. Let's not. I'll win. Well, you don't want to play with me. Oh, i do. I'll even go first. Derek's married. (joe) okay. George, beer is dripping from your nostrils. Told you i'd win. Nothing you could say could top that. I'm pregnant. I win. What are you gonna do? You know what happens with pregnant interns. I am not switching to the vagina squad or spending my life popping zits. I'm too talented. Surgery's my life. There are other options besides termination, you know? Adoption. I know this is a difficult decision. Okay, you know, the talking part? Mm-hmm. I'm not interested. You look nice today. Wore my new lip gloss. 'Cause my ex-boyfriend's wife looks like isabella freakin' rossellini and i'm, like... me. I'm trying to outdo her when she's the victim here. How crazy is that? Ex-ex-boyfriend? I'm an evil mistress. E.t.t.s. Is usually impossible to correct unless you happen to be one of a handful of surgeons in the world who knows how to separate fetal blood vessels, which, luckily for you, i am. And dr. Grey will be back to check on you a little bit later. Actually, i'd prefer it if dr. Grey were taken off the case. You understand. No, no, i don't understand. Well, she's sleeping with your husband, right? Ms. Phillips... i lack dr. Grey's class and patience, so let me set the record straight. My husband didn't cheat on me. I cheated on him. So the wronged woman here... dr. Grey. So, i think you owe her one hell of an apology. So i go upstairs and i step on a man's jacket that doesn't belong to me. It's a jacket that i recognize. And what i know now is that when i go into my bedroom, i'm not just gonna see that my wife is cheating on me. I'm gonna see that my wife is cheating on me with mark, who happened to be my best friend. I left, i came out here. And you met me. And i met you. It'll be years before i retire. Chief of surgery is mine. Chief of surgery is mine. It was yours, now i'm not so sure. I am the best surgeon at grace with the lowest mortality rate. You can't just bring some guy in from... now ask me why i'm not so sure about you. You wanna be chief? You put the job first. Hey, um, do you still have those reservations? 'Cause i'm starving. Cristina, i think there's something we should discuss. Yeah. Yeah, there is. It's pretty clear. It is? We've been fooling ourselves, to think that we could continue like this without consequences. Oh, you're ending this? It's nothing personal. He dumped me. You realize this constitutes hugging? Shut up. (cristina) what is she doing? She's hanging out with alex. Why? I think they might be friends. Do another one. Make the lambs stop screaming. (izzie) yeah, i know. I know. You guys hate him. Fine. Yeah, we do. But i just want to say that... that he's different once you get to know him. Izzie, would you like to go out with me tonight on a date? You wear something gorgeous, i pay for food. Are you making fun of me? I'm not making fun of you. Okay, then. Good. Good. Yang? What? Sorry. Is my surgery interfering with your daydreaming? no. Cristina. Cristina. (miranda) let's get her out of here. There's a tient on the table. Lift. Good, good, good. Dr. Bailey, when you get her stabilized, i need a report, please. Dr. Bailey. Right, dr. Burke. (addison) it was an extrauterine pregnancy. The tube burst. She's bleeding out. She doesn't want to be touched. how come you haven't gotten on your broomstick and gone back to new york where you belong? Stop being petty. Stop being an adulterous bitch. You know you are going to forgive me eventually, right? I mean, you can't just... i mean, there was a time where you thought of me as your best friend. There was a time where i thought you were the love of my life. Things change. Divorce papers? The ball's in your court. You sign, i'll sign. I'll sign and be on the first plane out of here. I'll sign them immediately. I want you out of here as soon as possible. Derek, have you ever thought that even if i am an adulterous bitch that i still might be the love of your life? Meredith, she gave me divorce papers. Well, that's good. All i have to do is sign, and i'm free. We're free. Is there anything to think about? No, of course not. I have to read through them, sign, and then addison's on the next plane outta here. I had a good time. I gotta go. Seriously? Seriously? So, uh, thanks for, you know, being there. No thanks needed. Okay. So where are we? Uh, the northeast corner of the hospital. Oh, i'm... i'm getting back on my feet. Fine. That doesn't mean that... cristina. It's my first day back. I've got... i'm not waiting forever. I'm glad we're doing this. Me, too. Want a drink? Yes. Oh. I'll get it. I'll get it. You didn't sign the divorce papers. Fine, i get it. End of discussion. Meredith... what? What is that? Hey, stop it. Seriously? Seriously. This is a very small bed. I look fantastic. I shaved my legs. He's a brain surgeon. How can he be so brainless? Hello! Seriously. Seriously. Shh. Dr. Bailey... henry lamott, age, is scheduled with dr. Shepherd for a spinal impnt to control the pain of his herniated disk. Is allergic to all pain medication. Is that... porn. Porn? As in porn? We can't have porn in here. This is a hospital. It's for my pain. My doc says it releases endorphins in the brain. That does not look comfortable. Trust me, it's not. Get the hall. (alex) hey, izzie. Izzie. Hey, doll fa. I was gonna ask you a favor. No. You haven't even heard what i'm... no. No. No.No.No. What's up with you? She's really mad at you. (alex) so, dude, what's the deal with izzie? She shaved her legs for you. And? And you didn't even kiss her good night. She shaved her legs for you and you didn't follow through? Hey, i follow through. I always follow through. You didn't last night. Mind your own business. Dude, we're not moving. It's bad? How bad is it? Two interns and a g.s.w. To the chest. (man) it's all jammed up. We can't get it open. How's the patient? He's not looking so good. You guys are gonna have to open up his chest. How are we doing? Oh, can you move me to another room? The lights and the tv went out. Power outage in the east wing. They'll have it back on soon. God, well, what am i gonna do? You mean... without my porn? I'm sure you can find some normal way of amusing yourself. No, i need my porn. You're really in pain. What do you think, i'm some kind of pervert, watching that stuff in front of you? Well, yes. Take these. Alex, come on. Alex! (izzie) poor george. He doesn't have the steadiest hands. Izzie. Yeah. He can hear you. O'malley... how you doin' down there? "Oh, yes, i'm so very, very naughty," bianca said as she, uh, dropped her stethoscope. And then there was marta... (sighs) where was i? Marta. Contact social services, see if we can get somebody down here to talk to 'em. Look, do you need me for anything else work related? Look, i was married for 11 years. Addison is my family. That is 11 thanksgivings, 11 birthdays and 11 christmases. And in one day, i'm supposed to sign a piece of paper and end my family? A person doesn't do that, not without a little hesitation. I'm entitled to a little uncertainty here. Just a moment to understand the magnitude of what it means to cut somebody out of my life. I'm entitled to at least one moment... of painful doubt. And a little understanding from you would be nice. I think i can feel his heart starting to fill more. It's beating a little stronger. (preston) excellent. Okay, now what? That's it. That's it? O'malley. Yes, sir. You just flew solo. Way to go, george. I have my finger in a heart. Very cool. (meredith)Dude, you lost youmojo. I have one off day... you chickened out. I hesitated briefly. Why didn't you kiss izzie? And now i'm leaving. I've never had a boyfriend. I've never even been kissed. Alex... would you kiss me? For a kiss to be really good, you want it to mean something. You want it to be with someone you can't get out of your head. You can't cheat your first kiss. Trust me. What? Because when you find that right person, the first kiss... is everything. Good night. Seriously. So, uh, here's where we are. I work too much, i'm competitive, i'm always right. And i snore. What? I'm trying here. So? Okay, we're a couple. Whatever. Don't make a big deal about it. Look... i don't want someone who doesn't want me, meredith. But if there's the slightest chance that he does, i'm not leaving seattle. (meredith) your choice, it's simple... her or me. Ani'm sure she's really great, but, derek, i love you... in a really, really big, pretend to like your taste in music, let you eat the last piece of cheesecake, hold a radio over my head outside your window, unfortunate way that makes me hate you love you. So pick me. Choose me. Love me. I'll be at joe's tonight. So if you do decide to sign the papers, meet me there. I actually said, "pick me. "Pick me"? I think it's romantic. It's not romantic, joe. It's horrifying. You think he'll show? Hey. It is getting a little hard to watch. It was hard to watch an hour ago. Now it's just pathetic. Who's pathetic? (man) joe, turn up the tv. a massive train wreck occurred... (joe) a train wreck... that'll empty a bar pretty fast. (whispers) george. You're staying with her. Yeah, she's my wife. (miranda) dr. Shepherd, she's crashing. You took the clinical skills section of your medical board exams after most interns, so the results are only now coming out. I failed the medical boards. If i tell izzie, she'll be nice about it, all supportive and optimistic. She might as well rip my nads off and turn 'em into earrings. What happens, uh if i take the exam for a second time and i don't pass? You will no longer be a surgical resident at seattle grace. Failing again is not an option. (izzie) well, do you feel like doing it tonight? Well, i'm on call so... god, what is wrong with you? Why do you have to be so... what is wrong with you? Ow. do you feel like doing it now? What, right now? People have sex in this hospital all the time. (preston) it's a key. Just a key? Just a key. Well, good. Good. Or... you could start thinking about moving in with me. If it's me, just tell me it's me. It's not you. Well, then is it a medical thing or... or a problem? Because guys have problems sometimes. I don't have a problem. This is where i live. I don't do laundry. I buy new underwear. I hired a maid once. She ran away crying. Still think living together is a good idea? Let me ask you something. When we were together, it was good, right? (izzie) everyone answered their page except dr. Karev. Where is he? We need everyone. Uh, i don't know. He was on call last night. He might be asleep. Go find him. (izzie) he cheated on me. He cheated on me. He cheated on me with george's skanky syph nurse. That is just plain rude! Hell hath no fury like a girl whose non-boyfriend screws a nurse. Bitch. How about here? Does it hurt here? Yes, it does. Okay, seriously, if you're that lonely, there are excellent vibrators. I can give you catalogues. He failed his boards. I'm helping him study. You failed your practical? Glad to know you can keep a secret, grey. I kept your secret, it didn't do you any good. He needs our help. What's going on? Are you mad, are you depressed, what? No, everything's fine. We're fine, addie, you know? Just... i'll see you at home. Okay? (meredith) do you love her? I don't know. It's good that you're trying. You wouldn't be you if you weren't the kind of person who was trying to make it work. You think so? Yeah. It means i wasn't wrong about you. Wake up. God, no wonder you failed your boards. What, do you expect to learn this stuff by osmosis? Why would you want to help me after what i did? Because it's what jesus would freakin' do! Double scotch,single malt. You're a good man. The way i see it, sometimes you get what you want in life... i'm not saying this to hurt you or because i want to leave you, because i don't. Meredith wasn't a fling. She wasn't revenge. I fell in love with her. Sometimes you don't. That doesn't go away because i decided
