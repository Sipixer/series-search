Thick skulls... Strong hearts... Keen senses. Morning. Morning. Mm. And when the body starts to fail... Medicine takes over. Morning, kim, sean. How are you feeling? Ready. Today is the day. How are you doing? Okay. Surgeons are arrogant enough to think... There's no o we can't save. Hey, you need a consult? Uh, kim allan. She had stage iv large cell lung cancer. I removed a second mass from her right lung About two months ago, but her tests had showed that The cancer had spread to her lymph nodes and to her liver. She was readtted last week with pulmonary edema. I drained as much fluid as i could, But she is still having a tough time breathing. That's too bad. You gonna have to intuba her? She doesn't want that. You're gonna have to treat her palliatively. I don't see what else we can do for her. She wants us to help her die. Like i said, dying isn't easy. Since the state requires two physicians' signatures, I've asked dr. Hunt toook over your chart. Okay. Her prognosis says that she has less than six months to live. I have informed her of her treatment options. She has met with a psychologist who has determined That she is mentally fit. And this can serve as her second oral request. Okay. You have to say it. Washington state says i have to hear you ask two times At least 15 days apart. it's so weird. It's like i'm applying to die. Well, if you're having second thoughts-- You saw how bad it got last night. It's just gonna get worse. I would like to end my life Through physician-Assisted suicide. Excuse me. Um... I-I'm just gonna go see what up. Dr. Altman. How long does it take... To die... once i take the barbiturates? Can we not talk about this? It's just, um... We're not there yet. We are there, sean. we are. Kim, to answer your question... About 45 minutes. It takes about 45 minutes to die. Three dates, no sex. Just talking.

They have laws for people like that. You gotta tell her. All rit, so in the third quarter, The collection rate of medicaid was what percent again? Hey. Would you excuse me one second? You have 30 seconds. Okay, so this woman comes in to the e.R. With abdominal pain. She's had it off and on for about six months. Mm-Hmm.

You know, when you ask them how they're feeling, And they don't want to tell you, And you think they're being difficult? I think they really don't know. Relax. Deep bredeep breaths. Good. (Woman speaking indistinctly over p.A.) Where do you stand on physicians'-Assisted suicide? Well, i'm not opposed to it. Good. And as long as we're talking about the controversial stuff, Let's get something straight-- Arena football is not real football. Obviously-- Mark, mark, wait. This is not me getting to know you. This is... i have a patient who's terminal. She wants to die and she wants my help, And i want yours. See that? The tur's pressing down On the floor of the fourth ventricle, Which is causing the nausea. So you debulk the tumor, And then you move on to the stalk-- No. You debulk the tumor. dr.

When you did kim allan's evaluation, Did you scope her? What? Wait. Is that her chart? Dr. Altman's patient, who, according to this chart, You ordered pulmonary function tests one week ago. I'd like to know if, during that evaluation, You did a bronchoscopy. Is there a problem? Can you just answer the question? Why are you interrogatg me? P.F.T.S can give you false positives, And a patient may kill herself due to incorrect data. Well, it's routine, so we probably did-- Probably? Probably is good enough for? Probably is good enough for dr. Altman? What is going on? Are... Owen. did you call lani? Um, you should call your wife. She'll freak. Tommy, call when i go in. Downplay it. It's a broken leg. A little frostbite on your fingers, but nothing terrible. You're about to... aah! Um, scream really loud. that was worse than when i broke my ankle on kilimanjaro. You guys climbed kilimanjaro? Couple of years ago. I made it to the summit while these guys got altitude sickness Half a mile from the top. man. You guys are hard-Core. We gotta be. I sell insurance. Phil and tommy are accountants. Ah! These trips are all we got to keep our blood moving. Y, show 'em the picture of you on top of kili With the rubber chicken. That doesn't look like you on a mountain. Oh, sorry. That's my daughter hannah. Ladybug for halloween. You telling me you don't want one of those? You stole my surgery right out from under me. It wasn't your surgery. It was nelson's surgery. It's beyond nelson's skill level. Right? I mean, that's what you said-- My diagnosis, my tumor, my debulking. Can i scrub in at least? You're on nelson's service. If i switch you, it's gonna look like favoritism. Dr. Nelson's been given an aneurysm-- You stop talking. meredith, calm down. People are starting to stare. You stole my surgery. He stole my surgery. Everything okay? Yeah, it's fine. Everything's, uh... fine. Have you had lunch yet today? I'm headed down. Oh, i can't eat in the cafeteria anymore. The vultures won't leave me alone. Vultures? People need things from me. Seems like everybody has a pressing problem That can't wait. Shepherd, you have a minute? Mm-Hmm. See? Ugh. My lunch is making me s, And i haven't even started eating it yet. say something. shut up. I was gonna go for lasagna. I don't know why i didn't pull the trigger. Say it. Shut up. Say what? nothing. Hello. Okay, then. If you don't say it, You're gonna regret it for a long, long-- enough. Okay, what is it with you two? What is your problem? Teddy, i-- You go to shepherd behind my back About a patient you don't even know? You have no idea what she's been dealing with, The kind of pain that she's in-- Pain that's only gonna be worse After i ram a tube down her throat Because you're having some kind of problem With her exercising her legal right to die. So i want to know, what the hell is your problem? You missed it. Altman tore hunt a new one in the cafeteria. Whole hospital's talking about it. Oh, not to me. I walk in the room, And all conversation grinds to a halt. Well, come on. You don't talk locker room talk in front of the coach. I'm not a coach anymore. I'm a player. I take a shower like everybody else. Richard... You're a little bit like everybody else. But mostly, you're still a coach. It's a sign of respect. It would be wrong toake it any other way. You know the drill-- We've put you in a twilight state, Next we're gonna spray lidocaine on the back of your throat And pass the scope-- I don't get it. She had this test last week. Isis there a chance the results are wrong? It's very unlikely. But it's possible? You wouldn't put her thrgh this again for no reason. You must think that there's a chance the tests were wrong. There are questions being raised that have nothing to do with-- By who? Raised by who? Sean-- Just talk to me, 'cause i'm standing here Thinking that my wife's gonna die today, And if that's not gonna happen, all right, If there's a chance that she might get better-- your wife isn't gonna get better. This test is unnecessary, And the hospital's covering its ass. thank you. no problem. Julie... Can you find out if dr. Bailey's on her way? Okay, doctor. if i wasn't happily married, I'd hit her. I'd hit her ha. Sir, i think what you wanted  say Was "hit that." I don't thk you wanted to say that at all. I hear shepherd took your surgery. How'd you hear that? Appantly you yell really loud. Yeah, well, i have to hold a retractor for shadow shepherd While derek debulks my tumor. So, yes, i yell very loud. Yeah, well, the key is to think of yourself As one of the whos down in whoville. What? You know, when, um, The grinch came down and stole all their presents... They didn't lethat ruin christmas for them. You know, instead, they came out on christmas morning And they sang. You're gonna go into that surgery, And you're gonna sing. Sing, cindy lou. Sing. Your scalp lac is small enough That shooting in lidocaine would be more painful Than just throwing in a couple of staples. Is this gonna hurt like my fingers? Because-- Not too much. Aah! God! aah! Aah! Sorry, sorry. Aah! Okay, that's it. I got it. the hand aawas swelling so much, It would've popped the finger right off. what? You're still trying to save the arm. You gotta tourniquet it. If i do, then you will lose it. it's not about the arm. If i could just try to tie off that brachial artery-- Owen! It's not about the arm. You're right. I know. I know. You're right. Okay, dan, listen to me. The back of this truck is trashed. Most of the supplies, all the morphine-- There's no morphine. There's no lidocaine. You bring whiskey? Okay, we got it. We got it. we got it. We got it. We got it. No. I don't think we do. dr. Hunt. Kim allan's bronchoscopy Confirmed that nothing more could be done. Sloan signed off. He did his due diligence, but it's over. I won't let you kill him.L him. You're not gonna kill him. Dr. Hunt... the patient in question is a woman. No one's trying to kill her. She's choosing to die. You should go home. I have a surgery. You're done for the day. Go home. Okay, okay. Can you-- Can you hold this? I c-- Can you put pressure there? I don't think-- Okay, i'm gonna have to move you-- Oh, no, i can't. I can't. I'm too tired. No, no, no. Dan, dan, wake up. Wake up. I have to. It's gonna hurt like hell, But i have to find something to pack this wound Till someone comes. Someone's coming? Someone's coming? Okay, you ready? Here we go. Here we go. okay, here we go. Here we go. Aah! Oh, please, please! Please! please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please just... don't. I'm sorry. There we go. There we go. Hypoermia-- Uh, that's the last one. The last... Stop that. Someone is coming. Help is coming. You been saying that for hours. i'm coagulopathic. I'm probably acidotic. I'm in the triad of death. No one is coming. If i could just move you-- No! Look, hunt, i need you-- I need you to say a hail mary with me. Dan... I don't know it. That's okay. It's okay. Just say it with me. Hail mary... hail mary... Full of grace... full of grace... The lord is with thee. The lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women... blessed art thou amongst women... Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, jesus. Blessed is the fruit of thy wb, jesus. Holy mary, mother of god... holy mary, mother of god... Pray for us sinners... pray for us sinners... Now... now... And at the hour of our death. And at the hour of our death. Amen. Amen. You make sure lisa gets my ring, all right? Don't give up, dan. Don't--Don't use it to propose to altman or something. But you--You should propose to altman. you know, you two, you should--You should... Shut up, dan. I'm engaged to beth. And you, you are gonna give that ring to lisa, okay? come on. Come on. What? No. move your hand. No. That's an order, soldier. No, sir. They're working on nick's kidney. Uh, i was able to stabilize his legs, But it's gonna be a long recovery process. You may need to let his wife know It's a little bit more than a broken leg. Yeah, i told my wife, and she's calling lani. My wife can handle her better. so you-- You summited kili, You run with the bulls, But you're--You're scared of your friend's wife. I was scared on kili. I hated every minute of it. So why do it? Nick and phil. They're my boys. And they love adventure. Me? I got a kid... And bad knees. But i can't ruin it. We're a team, you know? So you just suck it up, huh? Close my eyes and hope i don't die. I can't actually give you the drugs, But you can have this prescription filled In the hospital pharmacy. Again, i want to emphasize, there are other options. We can make you comfortable. I just he e queson. Owen, no-- What if they find a cure? I know that it's a long shot, but isn't saving your life Worth gambling on a long shot? Dr. Hunt, i will call security if you do not step-- Let--Let her answer. I'd like to hear the answer. Maybe... You have to be dying to understand. But there's this thing that happens... where death stops being scary. What starts being scary is hope... 'Cause it's not true. Even if they found a cure for cancer tomorrow... It's too late for me. and hanging on to hope, It may make you feel better... But it just makes me feel alone. I don't want to die alone. Okay? I am not afraid of this. Why are you? Why are you so afraid to let me die? Dr. Hunt. The pharmacy wouldn't take my insurance card. There was some problem. So i had to go to a cash machine. And, uh, i'm running around-- I'm trying to get enough cash To buy the pills that are gonna kill my wife. Anyway... Here they are. There'll be a moment... When she dies, her face will relax and... All that pain that she was in, it'll be gone. And you will feel relief... Relief for her, relief for you. And you will know with absolute certainty... That you did the right thing. Just for a moment... You gotta let me go, hunt. Okay? You gotta let me go. Please. It hurts. It hurts. Oh, please. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Look at me. Okay, you gotta do it. You gotta do it. I can't make you do it. Okay? Oh, jeez, it hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It'skay. It's okay. It's okay. Okay? You gotta do it. it's okay. You have to hold on to that moment, Because all the rest of it... Is just your own garbage. you'll be in physical therapy For six months, But with luck, uh, you'll be ready for your trip next year. Pamplona, baby! Pamplona! Pamplona. Oh, come on. He hates this stuff. All right, the adrenaline, The adventure--He-- He does this just for you guys, Because you guys love it, and he l you. And... that's my rant for the day. I'm sorry. I like to see people keep their legs. Ignore me. You know, i'm starting my own business. That keeps my blood pumping. I'm with tommy. Sorry, nick. I can't believe you guys. I almost died jumping out of a damn helicopter... When i really wanted to go wine tasting in napa. Napa. napa! Ugh. It... The place looks different. Something's different. Something i can help you with? You were jealous of her today. I'm sorry? Meredith. That's why you stole her surgery. You miss the pace of back-To-Back surgeries, The adrenaline. Yeah, i do. Schedule yourself one surgery a day-- In the morning, rly, an hour before anyone else-- So at the very least you start your day good. You start your day cutting. And you don't have to actually sign all the paperwork. Patricia's an excellent forger. And if you eat alone in the cafeteria, You are a sitting duck. So you need to eat with someone else. That way people are more likely to leave you alone. You can eat with me. Thank you. living is better than dying... Until it's not. I'm scared. Come here. But even if letting a person die Is the right thing to do... It's not what surgeons are built for. We are arrogant and competitive. I'm sorry. I'm not mad. I'm in whoville. Whoville? Whoville. We don't like to lose... Um... This is really hard for me to say, 'Cause i really care about you, and-- Oh, my god. You're breaking up with me. Mark? Is it--Is it mark? Are you sleeping with mark again? 'Cause are--Are you one of those fake lesbians, Just having a va-Vacation in lesbian land and-- Stop. God, it's not bad. This thing i have to tell you isn't bad. Um... i just... I want to have a baby... At some point in my life. That's all. I really... I have to have a baby. And death... Feels like a loss... Even when we know it's not. (Knock on door We know it's time. We know it's right. Hey there. Hey. Come in. I helped my patient die today. You want to talk about it? No. We know we did everything we could. it's okay. Ok? You gotta do it. You gotta do it. I can't make you do it. You--You gotta do it. Okay? What are you... Oh. I... i couldn't sleep. Are you okay? But it's hard to shake the feeling that... We could've done more. yeah. Yeah, i'm fine. Go back to bed. Owen... Wh-What are you thinking? Nothing.
