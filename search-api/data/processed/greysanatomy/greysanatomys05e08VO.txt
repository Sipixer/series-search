And you're poking at brains like they're silly putty. You form a bond With the surgeons right next to you... An unbreakable, indescribable bond. It's intimate, being tied together like that... You up? No. Yes. Whether you like it or not, Whether you like them or not, you become family. The wicked witch is dead. Metaphorically dead or dead dead? Who are we talking about? Hahn. Hahn. Her name is off the surgical board. Her surgeries have been canceled. I don't know how or why, but I do know hahn is gone. That's too bad. She was really talented. You're not talking to me. Hi. Hi. Is, uh, grey home? Yes. Death? Come on. Where are you, death? Death?! Aah! Die! Oh, my god! It's been-- Forever. Oh. Oh, wow. You look like... Death! Death! Is the guy in the pajamas your boyfriend?

Before med school. You know that woman all but kicked me out of the bed? That's terrible. And death? Meredith's name is not death. It's mer. I really feel for you. You know, she's never even mentioned this woman. I mean, how good of a friend can she be? Good enough to kick us both out of bed Welcome to my world. This woman is the reason I went to med school in the first place. I figured if a slacker like death... Mer. Mer. Could handle slicing people open, then I could, too. Meredith's not a slacker. Ooh, I could tell you some stories. But you won't. So, sadie, you postponed your residency To work in a morgue? Yeah, you know, a lot of the fun cutting, None of the rules, but I got bored. Started craving blood that was flowing. And now you're here. I can't believe you're here. Yay. Iz, you coming? Yeah. I just need a minute. Look, I get it. Hahn's case brought up the denny thing. But hahn's not even here anymore. It's stuff from the past. Stuff from the past, iz. You don't understand. I might... If you'd talk to me. Fine. See you inside. I'm walking. Morning. Walking straight ahead, all by myself. You know, you look good. Tired, but good. Did I mention I find the short hair kind of sassy? Now I'm turning this corner, again, all alone. Ouch. Um... These are s--uh, scratches from my kitten. He's a crazy scratchy scratcher. You're a cat person? I meant hairbrush. It--it--i have a crazy scratchy hairbrush. Solo surgeries are at stake here, three. I can't have you acting weird Or wounded. I'm--i am on top of my game. Really. I'm sending you to plastics, far, far away. Just go. Hey, what do you know about a heart guy named dixon? Dixon? Uh, no, not a guy. I've heard of virginia dixon. She's got an incredible record. Really low mortal-- Wait. Is she coming here? Yeah. Today. Piggyback heart transplant. I'm on the case. What? What? W-why am I not on the case? So she's your pre-cristina cristina? You gonna tell me why she calls you death? Oh, no. The adventures of dea and die Are better left untold. Hey, Pedia's julienning her skinny little chickearms And still no word on what made "h" hitch a ride With her flying monkeys. Later. Translate that for me. Lexie may be a secret cutter, And there's still no word on why hahn quit. Is that true, about lexie? I don't know. How would I know? If it's true, what are you gonna do about it? Nothing. Meredith, you can't do nothing. She's your sister. And? And you're family. I'm not understanding. Lexie is your family. Forget it. Hello, dr. Hunt. Dr. Yang. Thank you. Hey, what do we got? Uh, crush injuries. Couple minutes out. Hey, w-what do you know about hahn? Um, she's gone. Yeah, but why? I don't know. You two are friends. I don't want to talk about it, okay? I want blood and guts and mangled bones. I want a guy so badly smashed up, it takes all day to fix him. I want to rock a surgery. I don't want to talk about hahn. Okay, okay. Unidentified man with prolonged extrication time. They had to fish him out of a working garbage truck. Multiple crush injuries, open fractures, g.C.S. 3, And we couldn't unhook him in the field. Unhook him? His femur's broken in half, and it's puncturing his torso. He's impaled. Impaled on himself? Human pretzel. That'll do. Wow. Check his popliteal pulse. I'm getting nothing. That's because his knee is over here. You think he was sleeping in that dumpster And they started crushing the trash? That's a bad day. Here I am.What did I miss? It's your first day.Why don't you just stand back and shut up? Breath sounds are clear and equal both sides.Unbelievable So no punctured lung.We need a portable x-ray and an ultrasound Someone paged us?I did you did? that's a first. So is this. I've seen a lot of trauma-Guys cut in half amputations, eviscerations.But I have never seen anything like this I wondered if you could help. You hire when you're number 1, not number 12. But I need you to be my ambassador today. Show dr. Dixon what seattle grace is all about. I've thrown a lot of money, a big title And a lot of research dollars at her. But... But what? Um... She's a little different. She's a little off. So we're wooing today, bailey. I can woo with the best of 'em. So, what, dixon is a nut job? Excuse me? I'm just saying, I've already had my quota of crazy For the year. Hey, I've had my off days. You want to judge me? You never even met the woman, karev. Now you heard the chief. Our job is to impress dr. Dixon today, So be impressive. I've got the chart for dr. Dixon. I'm ready to work. I'm excited. Don't be. She's off. Karev. You okay? Yeah. All right. Heads-up. Here she comes. Oh, dr. Dixon. H-hi. Welcome to, uh, seattle grace. We're very happy to h-have you here. I'm--i'm dr. Bailey. I-i brought my own lab coat. I'm here to perform a heart transplant today. I do hearts. A procedure invented by christiaan barnard in 1967. I do hearts. Uh, i--i'm dr. Richard webber. We spoke on the phone. Karev, would you get dr. Dixon the latest labs? Stevens, let's prep the patient, please. Okay, then. She's a little off. His femur's in pieces, I mean, except for the part that's stuck in his torso. There's no way I'm saving that leg. It looks like the impaled piece is lodged under his clavicle C-spine looks clear. Without a c.T., It's hard to be sure. And why can't we get a c.T. Scan The way he's impaled, it's hard to get a clear reading. You know, there is such a thing as a stupid question. Stand over there. Guys, guys, we have a very limited window here, okay? With vitals like these, in a few more hours-- His body won't be able to withstand surgery at all Good thing he's unconscious. Well, we can't do anything Till we dislodge the femur from his Clavicle. Okay, then let's unimpale him Yang, grey, new kid, hold his shoulders. Brace him hard. I'll hold his c-spine. I got his torso. I need to guide the posterior hip dislocation. The second that leg is out, be ready to assert pressure To stop the bleeding. Got it? Better thaworking on corpses, huh? On the count of three. One... Two... Three. Okay, push directly on the clavicle while I pull. Femur's really wedged in there. Okay, almost there. Almost there. Steady. Just a little bit further. S-sloan, I need you to, um, Rotate his knee to my right. Push 10 of morphine now! Oh, gee. Okay, all right. Up, up, up, up. Just get in there and hold the pressure. Okay, get his femur stabilized and down by his side. Hurry! Hold pressure. Get in there. Come on. Aah! Corpses don't do that. I need you to calm down, sir. What are you doing to me? Sir, can you tell us your name? Get out of my face! Get your hands off! You're hurting me! Do as he says. Hands off, everybody. But-- hands off. Thank you. What's your name? Timothy miller. Mr. Miller, w-we need to get you into surgery. I'm gonna be able to walk, right? I gotta be able to walk. Right now, we're just trying to keep you alive. Our cardiac wing is extensive And well-equipped with all of- The first successful heart transplant Was performed on september 7, 1896, By dr. Ludwig rehn, frankfurt, germany. Okay. Uh, excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt. Uh-- Please inter-- I mean, just, uh, Please update dr. Dixon on the patient. Uh, dr. Stevens is prepping Your transplant patient for surgery. They scheduled a-a-a transplant six years ago, But the heart was too small, so they doubled up And added a donor heart to help his own heart function. They did a piggyback-- heterotopic transplant. Piggyback is the colloquial name for the procedure. Don't do that. Don't do that. How about we... Take you to meet the patient? They tell my heart belonged to a girl that was hit by a car While she was hitchhiking. And now when I'm driving, I see hitchhikers all the time, Always up ahead, just up ahead, But when I get up ahead, they're gone. You're not buying any of this, are you? I should never have gotten the heart. I-i don't understand how the heart-- Navajos--we don't even touch the dead We don't touch their bodies or belongings Because the spirit clings there. So to have part of a dead body sewed into my chest is... My friends who follow the old ways, They begged me not to do it. I should've listened. I'm sorry. I don't understand. You think you're haunted by your transplanted heart, But you're here for a new transplant. No! That's what I'm trying to tell you I don't want it. I don't want the new one. I just want you to take the old one out. Wait. That's just plain stupid. Take the heart, man. Take the heart if they offer it. Did he just say he doesn't want the donor heart? Yes, ma'am. Clay bedonie, are you aware that without a new heart, You'll live a short life attached to a machine Before dying a sudden and agonizing death? See, that--that's what I'm talking about. Five parallel pulley stitches per cut, then switch. You sure I'm numb? Toughen up. When one of our residents gets picked for the solo surgery, One of us gets to scrub in, so we have a goal here. Focus on the goal. Solo surgeries. Totally worth it. Solo... Surgeries. Totally worth it. Hello, hello. I need someone to run these labs And pull these x-rays, please. Will do. Hey, this looks like a cool place to hang out. What are you guys doing? This is for interns. It's--it's our hangout. Go find your own. Sorry. Solo surgeries. Totally worth it. I don't want to live if I can't walk. We'll do our best to save the leg-- I'm homeless. Walking is how I survive. It's how i... Get from one day to the next. Marion street's safe from 2:00 to 6:00 a.M. And then I go over the half-mast bridge, And I hang there till 6:30 until the traffic hits. And then I go over to belltown and hang out on the waterfront. And then the waterfront, If it's trouble, then I go back up to 4th street. I'm homeless. I-i can't not walk. I-i--what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Your injuries are critical. If we n't get you to surgery-- Will your surgery make me walk? Huh? Then I don't want it! Okay. All right. You heard the man. The surgery's off. I appreciate you trying to advise me to do What you think is best. These are facts, not opinions. What'm saying is-- He's trying to say he would rather live a shorter life That's unhaunted than a longer one that is. I'm not saying I agree. I'm just... I'm just gonna stand over here. That's a good idea. The heart that you take out of me, what happens to it? It goes from the o.R. To pathology to medical waste. I need that heart back for ritual. We have laws. There are rules. Rules are rules. Maybe there's a compromise to be made here. Uh, we could, I don't know, Uh, give him back the old heart to do the ritual, Then give him a chance to live By still putting the new heart in. No. No. It doesn't work that way. I will still be haunted, just by a new ghost. There are rules. We have laws, and there are-- Rules are rules and laws are laws. No. So that's it? No surgery? You're just gonna walk away? I'm respecting the patient's wishes. The patient's unstable with an open wound. Which we are packing. This guy is circling the drain. You cannot just walk away. Don't tell me how to run things in my e.R. Your e.R.? We save lives here. We don't just patch up patients and leave them to die. If you can't handle that, Go back  the desert and leave us here To do our jobs. Dr. Torres, please tell me you can figure out some way Well, the right femur's toast. So is the hip and half the pelvis, But if I put some pins here and maybe a plate here... I mean, there are some viable bone fragments. We're not starting from nothing. What do you think? I think it's wild. All right, she wasn't talking to you. It's her first day. Could you not be so- No, she's an intern. She needs to learn her place. I think it's a lot of hardware. What the guy needs is a whole new leg. Well, maybe I can do that. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a puzzle. I just need to figure out What equipment I need and--and how to pull it off. Like lincoln logs. Uh, it's a little more high-tech than that. It's exactly like lincoln logs. Okay, I need you guys to grab Every piece of titanium we've got in the hospital. Okay. Um, I need the hospital rules to specify the fact That we must respect all religious And spiritual beliefs of our patients. The rules? Yeah, I'm asking you to declare a rule Of our department. That we respect the beliefs of our patients? Yes. Isn't that just common courtesy? Yes. Then why am I declaring it? Um... Dr. Dixon doesn't do common courtesy, But she understands rules. So if it's a rule, we're golden. If not, we have a pissed-off patient An apoplectic surgeon, and none of those things Makes for a successful procedure On a faulty heart, Not to mention the failure to woo. You want me to announce it as a rule. I'm here's a witness, you can maybe raise your right hand, Put your left one On the "physicians' desk reference." It's a rule. Thank you. Dr. Dixon, I'm cristina yang. I'm a resident here, And I've been focused on cardio since I began my internship. I'm certainly looking forward to anything that you might-- Were the other ones taken off my case? Oh, uh, what other ones? The black one, the male one, the one with yellow hair. Not that I'm aware of. Then why are you talking to me? What happened to hahn? Wh-whatever made hahn leave, it can be fixed. U-unless she a was fired. She wasn't fired, was she? She's not coming back. You don't know that. She kinda does. How? Because she doesn't... Look, it's just too... We had a fight. Oh, please. Meredith and I fight all the time. We still work together. It's not like hahn was your girlfriend or something. Oh, my god. She was your girlfriend? Look, we hadn't... Figured it all out. Wait, so are you a lesbian now? I don't know. Maybe you were a once-bian. Or a twice-bian. Whatever. It's over. Are you okay? She's fine. Leave her alone. I hit the titanium mother lode. Hi. Hey. Oh, come on. Really? Hey, lexie. How are you? Is, uh, everything going okay? Why, did somebody say something, Like I was doing something? No, I'm just, uh, you know, as, uh, I'm asking As a person who's sort of related to you If there's anything bothering you-- so This is completely not as a boss or a residen Or a superior keeping an eye on what I do As a student in this program? No, no, I'm just a compassionate person, And I'm just wondering if you're Channeling your tragic pain into, uh, self-mutilation. Are you a secret cutter? No. Little grey, torres is, uh, trying to set a world record For most titanium rods used in one patient. You in? Little grey? Little grey. Big grey. That's how I tell you two apart. Yeah, I'm in. I'll just be a minute. Can't you people let a guy die in peace? Your, uh, vitals are slipping. I'm not gonna lie to you. That's not good. I been through worse. Yeah, I imagine you have. Oh, don't get like that. Don't look at me like I'm some tragic hero With a secret past. You have a story. We all have a story. I took a turn in my life. And I couldn't connect. I lost... I couldn't connect. My life, it took a turn and... And I just couldn't turn it back. Guys, we need to shut down for a few days. People are starting to get suspicious. I was accused of being a secret cutter. So wear long sleeves. Oh, I didn't realize we were inviting more people here. Are you kidding? A secret intern society? I'm all over that. We, I still think we need to take fewer risks. Fewer risks? Come on. You got a guard at the door. You're using more local anesthetic for three sutures Than you would upstairs for a chest tube. Look, I get that you're doing all this to learn new skills, But you're only gonna learn so much by being careful. Uh, actually, I would disagree. I think the only safe way to... Who wants to stitch me up? Oh, right here. You gonna tell me about death and die? Nope. But I did talk to lexie for you And now I need you to do something for me. What's that? I need you to tell mark to keep his little sloan Out of little grey. Is he hitting on you? No, not my little grey. Lexie's little grey. I don't know what's going on with her, But the last thing she needs Is sloan going all man-whore on her. So you need to tell him to step away from Little grey. All right. I'll see what I can do Little grey, derek. Little grey. Did she, uh... She say good-bye to you? Nope. Are you okay? Do I look okay? You look great. Then I'm okay. So... There's a 9-day ritual To--to undo a haunting? It starts with a 9-day ritual. Okay. Are you really gonna waste nine days on this? Dr. Stevens. Yes. Why are you sonterested in my haunting? Can... Can ghosts do things? I mean, can they make things happen in your life? I--i've had two cases with two patients in a row That have really reminded me of my dead fianc?- Heart transplants and l-vads and-- Could he be doing that? Could he be bringing them to me? Izzie, come on. Is he here right now, your ghost? I... I hate to ask, but... Oh, you don't want me in your surgery. It's not that I think there's something wrong with you. It's just... I don't need any extra ghosts In my operating room. Mr. Miller. What does a guy have to do To get a little peace and quiet around here? The fatigue you're feeling is from the blood loss. The queasiness, the dizziness-- It's because you're slowly bleeding to death. What, are you trying to scare him? No. I'm trying to ascertain whether he's suicidal or just defeated. Mr. Miller, you survived in the streets, So I know you're a fighter. That doesn't make me a fighter. It makes me lucky. How long you been out there, 10 years, 20? You're not in jail, you're not dead. That's not luck. You're smart. You gotta be smart to take care of yourself on your own. I guess. This... What you're doing right now, mr. Miller, Refusing surgery, It's not smart. There's a rehab center not too far from here. Medire takes care of it. You could stay there. Food, bed, long as you need. Just let us operate. Let us operate, and we'll figure the rest out. Wow. That's the fastest I've ever seen anyone Dissect through adhesions. Uh, dr. Dixon, there is a rule, uh, regarding Giving medical waste to the patient. Dr. Dixon? What? Uh, I was just saying there is a rule, An official, very, very specific rule, That in the event a patient asks for their organ Or body part back for any reason Related to or involving their cultural beliefs, We must respect that patient's wishes, And return that organ to the patient. That is the rule I forgot to tell you about. If I went down to pathology right now, Would they know about the rule? Oh, the chief would know. Uh, it's his rule. He declared it. A rule's a rule. Dr. Karev... Make sure that... We follow the chief's rule And return the heart to the patient after the surgery. I'm going back to work now. Clamp. What the hell is that gooey thing They're taking out of him? Oh. The silent treatment. Okay, if you're gonna be that way. I'll just, uh... I'll just stand here and--and be quiet. Okay, but that... That is disgusting. I thought you were gonna be quiet. You know, you're acting like you don't want me to be here. You know what I've wished for every day since you've died? I've wished that I could see you again. I'd have given anything just to see you... One more time. Looking at you and knowing that I can't touch you, It's hurting me. Izzie, you can touch me. You're not real. You can't be real. So that means that I'm sick Or something is wrong with me, and I can't hope for that. I... I can't hope. You're not real. Izzie, I am as real as you Or that gooey, disgusting thing down there. Touch me. Izzie... Touch me. I'll prove it to you. No! Why are you here? Why? I am here for you, izzie stevens. Clamp. Okay, that's it. The donor heart is separated. We have the cannulas ready for bypass. Next step is the l-vad. Y--what--what is that? That's not right. That can't be happening. His heart's beating. How is his heart beating on its own? It... Can't be happening. It shouldn't be happening. That heart is beating. That heart is beating. It shouldn't be beating. It sh-shouldn't be beating. I've never seen a reconstruction like this. Well, I've never done one like this. Here's hoping it works. All right. I'm ready for the rod. How are you guys doing up there? A lot of hemorrhaging, bleeding through the packing. Try the fibrin sealant. Good call. Thank you, dr. Shepherd. How you doin' on that lac, little grey? Good. Moving on to the next lac. You finished already? Let me see. Wow. Pulley stitches. Nicely done. Thank you, dr. Sloan. So my heart... It started beating by itself. If it continues to function like this, You won't need an l-vad or any other kind of machinery. It's wonderful news. It's very atypical. Not for me. I'm finally free. I'm not haunted anymore. Your heart had six years to rest, Which is... Probably enough time for it to repair itself, Which is why it started beating again. I've never seen this before. I've read about it, but I've never seen it before. You have your beliefs. I have mine. I don't have beliefs. I have science. Science is a belief, A belief in only what you can see and touch. I believe in more. Just thought I'd stop in to see how everything's going. Well, I'm still several hours away, But I may actually pull this off-- Rebuilding a man's skeleton from scratch. And we just found out that, uh, dr. Grey here Can out-pulley stitch shepherd. Oh, I wouldn't go so far as to say that. Excellent job, dr. Grey. And excellent job of teaching, dr. Yang. Sir? Taking the time to teach yo interns, And they are retaining that knowledge. I haven't made my decision yet on the solo surgery, But you keep teaching like that, and you're my one to watch. Thank you, sir. He's crashing. V-fib. Start c.P.R. Push 1 of epi and charge the paddles to 360. right away Clear. Thank you. Thank you so much. So what do you do now with the haunted piece? Do you bury it or... Burn it. Actually, my tribe's medicine man will burn it. I'm not allowed to even touch the smoke. So does the not-touching thing, Does that apply to just the flesh or-- No, we don't touch their belongings. We can cleanse jewelry, medals, but fabric, bedding, clothes, Books that were owned by the dead, We burn all of it. The spirit can cling to any of it. Oh, no. Your ghost... You still don't have anything of his, do you? Time of death--1922. I built his bones. You tried. We all tried. No, I didn't try. I did it. I did my part. I built his bones. I built his bones from scratch, And you... All of you, you were supposed to keep him alive. That is all you people had to do. You just had to... Keep his body breathing. You just had to keep him safe and--and breathing and living Until I made his bones. I made... I made his bones... Until... Until I made his bones. I made his bones. I made his bones. Why don't you guys go ahead, And I'll help dr. Torres clean up? Go call the morgue. We've got it. Go. Everyone, clear out. Uh, excellent job today, dr. Dixon. Excellent... Rule following. I only have one real area of interest--the human heart. I love it. I like its regularity. I know everything there is to know about it. I like its predictability. It has rules. Every chamber has a function, every function has a movement. I like the color. It's comforting. Are you familiar with asperger's syndrome, Dr. Bailey? Uh, of course. A significant impairment during social situations... I'm not good at cues like sarcasm or condescension, But I do know when I'm being manipulated, And I know when I'm being made fun of. I don't think I like this hospital very much. I don't think I like this hospital at all. Ah, that lexie grey Sure knows how to wrap herself around a suture. Mark, meredith has some concerns. Well, that's not news. About lexie. Apparently lexie is... Fragile, And getting involved with a superior Might make her more fragile, so... I was talking about her sutures. Keep little sloan out of little grey is my point. What? Little sloan does not enter little grey. Are we clear? Did you just say-- Okay, that's just creepy and inaccurate. Big sloan. You heading home? I love you. I will always love you. You own a piece of me. So even though you'll be gone, You will never be forgotten, not by me. I'm sorry we never got our chance. I'm sorry we never... Got to get married or have children Or grow old together. I wanted that so much. I wanted to be your wife morehan anything. Why are you telling me this? I'm trying to let you go So that your soul can be at peace. But I have peace, izzie. I'm here for you. Good-bye, denny. I love you. But good-bye. I can explain. I did not teach you the parallel pulley stitch. I can barely do that stitch myself. Whatever you guys are doing, shut it down. Do not practice on yourselves. That is insane. Shut it down. Iz? I see you. I've seen you all day. I-i see you struggling. And I know you don't want my help, But let me help you. Whatever it is, I can help. So let me. Will you burn this for me? I hate how hard it is. It's just, like, you get attached to someone, And then they work their way into your life, And then you wake up one day-- suddenly All you can think about is their little.. Another round? Oh, I'll get it. Tell me the stories. What stories? The ones you won't let sadie tell me. They're ancient history. Humiliating and ridiculous. Ridiculous is a grown man telling another grown man To stay out of a woman's little-- You did it? I did, those exact words. I did it because... It was nice to see you sticking up for your sister. I did it for you. So now you owe me... A story. Okay, fine. But you can never tell anyone, ever. I'm--i'm sorry we lost him, the patient. I'm--i'm sorry. I don't need you to be sorry. Okay. I don't need you to be sorry. Okay. I don't need-- All--all right. All ri-- I don't need you. The ties that bind us Are sometimes impossible to explain. They connect us Even after it seems like the ties should be broken. Some bonds defy distance... And time... And logic... Oh, god. I... I said good-bye. I b-- I burned the sweater. Yeah, thanks for that, by the way. I love that sweater. You made me that sweater. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Izzie-- Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Stop freaking out. You're not real. You're not real. Hey, I told you... You're not real. You are not real. I'm here for you. You are not real. You are not real. You are not real. Izzie, look at me. Touch me. You see? I told you I was real. Oh, god. Hey. Because some ties are simply...
