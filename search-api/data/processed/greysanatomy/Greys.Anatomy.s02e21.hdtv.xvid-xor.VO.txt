It was a horrible mistake. I'm done. We're done. Pancakes? he's not my roommate. This is why I shouldn't have given up my place. He would still be our roommate if meredit would just apologize. You know,at some point,you are going to have to talk to me. your ex did a real number on you,huh? -You didn't call me. -I did. I did. A few times. I just hung up every time. How is she today? She's great. She really lights up when dr. Webber visits. Denny,your congestive heart failure is getting worse despite the meds. We need more time. Proudly Presents Sync: YTET-gagegao -==www.ydy.com/bbs==- my college campus has a magic statue. It's a long-standing tradition for students to rub its nose for good luck. My freshman roommate really believed in the statue's power and insisted on visiting it to rub its nose before every exam. Are you sure my scrub caps aren't in the laundry delivery? I triple checked. -You're sure? -Yeah,I'm sure. Studying might have been a better idea. She flunked out her sophomore year. but the fact is,we all have little superstitious things that we do. all right,everybody it's a beautiful morning to save lives, people,okay? Let's have some fun. If it's not believing in magic statues, it's avoiding sidewalk cracks or always putting our left shoe on first... knock on wood... 10 blade. Step on a crack, break your mother's back. paddles. 10 joules. he's having a reaction. I need to take him off. I'm in the middle of his brain. We're losing him. time of death... time of death... time of death... call it,grey. The last thing we want to do is offend the gods. Time of death--8:17. four surgeries,four fatalities, and the day's barely started. Could I have a bite of that? No,you're in my apartment. You don't get to be in my food. Dr. Burke gave me a protein bar this morning. Burke packs his lunch for him. Did I mention? talked to the morgue guy this morning. The one with the unibrow? The one with the,like,teeth thing. And he said that surgical fatalities come in threes and sevens. Says there'll be three more before midnight. Well,okay,then, since dead tooth morgue guy said so. He's the morgue guy. He knows things about death. You dropped this. He's still ignoring me. ignore him back. Derek says I should apologize until he listens. "Derek says." It's good advice. He's my friend. That's good friend advice. Meredith... what? Did you sneak out last night? Yeah. I,uh... I couldn't sleep. -Come on. -Where? -E.R. -All of us? We've all had deaths. Let's all go save a life. Uh,dr. Bailey. Here you go. -What's this? -Hot cocoa. It's a little ritual we had in new york. Four surgeries,four deaths.I figure we could all use a little good juju. And cocoa equals juju how? don't question the cocoa. Carry on. Meredith... thank you for your help this morning. Oh,thank you,addison. Yeah. You know,thank you. here you go. -Juju. -Yep. -You jujued meredith. -I did... in the spirit of friendship. What,are we not being friends with meredith anymore? No,no,we are. Meredith and i are friends. Yeah,and you and i are married. So then by proxy, meredith and I are friends. That's very big of you. you don't have to do that. It's not like I'm gonna be friends with, let's say,uh... mark. Yeah,well,neither am I. Now finish your juju before somebody else dies. There are ten of them-- music notes, colorful patterns,they were sent out last night. Sorry to hear about your valve replacement this morning. The laundry misplaced my scrub caps. You know,there's some foolish talk goin' around about fatally clusters in threes and sevens. Are you sure they weren't sent to another hospital? How many electives have they canceled today? This is our third. And what have the surgeons been giving as their reasons? Because I prefer my own caps. You're not pushing your surgeries because you don't have your personal caps. You understand me? I didn't push any surgeries. No,no,the question is, when will you find them? No one changes that board unless they talk to me. No one. Great. No blood,no guts, no lives to save. It's dead quiet. Did you really just say that? -Cristina. -What? You said the "q" word. That's like saying macbeth in the theater. Please. You think because someone says it's quiet, -that it'll mean-- -can someone please help us here? -She's coughing up blood. -O'malley,take that. -denny duquette. -I got it. -He's my patient. -He's both your patients.Answer the call. two incoming. okay,uh,yang,first one's yours. Grey,take number two. Jesse fannon,32, unrestrained driver in a rear end collision. There was spider webbing of the front windshield where his head hit. B.P. Is 120 palp. Pulse is 75. what do you want to do,yang? A primary and secondary survey, uh,head C.T. And x-ray. Great,page shepherd when you get there. Wait! I'm counting the siren whoops. We can't go till it reaches 33. He also seems to have a touch of O.C.D. Nikki ratlin,30, erratic B.P. In the field, complaining of chest and leg pain. -What happened? -I got struck by lightning. Can anyone spell "coincidence"? Grey's Anatomy Season 02 Episode 22 My horoscope said, "stay close to home today." Aries couldn't have been any clearer. Okay,I guess it coulda said, "don't leave the house today unless you want to get struck by lightning." Ow. See,ms. Ratlin,you have no sign of wounds from lightning. It was a sign. Clearly,getting struck by lightning is a sign. A sign that I shouldn't have left my house. Nikki,normally people struck by lightning. Have a wound where the bolt entered and exited the body. Well... well,I wasn't "struck" struck. I--the tree was struck and it fell on me. A tree fell on you? A big,like,branch or a limb--whatever. Same difference. No,actually,medically, it isn't the same difference. And it would be helpful if, from now on... You told us the whole truth. You wanna know the truth? My boyfriend loves that tree. He's totally gonna freak out. Oh,chief,there's a,uh, ms. Warner down in admitting. She's asking for you. Who? Um,olive warner? 50s,uh,blonde hair. She said she's known you for about 20 years. Are you taking about ollie? RighT. Okay. Uh,ollie warner-- she presented with,uh, upper G.I. Bleeding. And she had a T.I.P.P.S. Procedure last month for esophageal varices. I'll take this from here, o'malley. I'm happy to help,sir. No,thank you. I got this myself. Ollie. hi! richard. It's good to see you. sinus tachycardia, low grade fever, pulse ox 75. I'm hearing rales in your lungs. Yeah,a freight train rolls through at noon. How bad is the pain? I don't know. A five or six when I breathe. That means a seven or eight when you're not trying to impress your doctor. I heard,uh, four people died in surgery this morning. Said they were expecting three more. You get that from a nurse? Never reveal my sources. Just like to avoid the O.R. And I'm not liking that look. This could be a pulmonary embolism,denny-- a complication from the lvad surgery. We're gonna have to talk to dr. Burke. I got hot chocolated. The she-shepherd hot chocolated me. It's her juju. I don't like people who say juju. I say juju. Juju,juju,juju. Juju,juju,juju. Juju,juju,juju... I didn't drink it. You're not obligated to honor some else's juju. thought you were being friends. I am,with him. Do I have to be friends with her,too? Definitely not maybe. I'll,uh,call psych for you. That would be good, thanks. All right, that's the worst of it. Oh,I never should've gotten out of bed. Oh! But I really wanted to surprise my boyfriend before he left for school. He had a huge exam today, and I just,you know, I wanted to wish him luck. Dr. Torres,hey. Hi. Uh,can I give you a hand? You missed the boat, george. You mean on this case or... or a hot chick gives you her number, you're supposed to call. -Yeah. -right. I was. -I mean,I am. -Too late. Ouch. Don't give up. I mean, if you really like her. Okay... Okay,the plot thickens. Nikki,dr. Grey here is gonna take you upstairs for a C.T. But before she does, I have to ask, you're bruised all up and down your left side. You sure a tree branch did all this? You think my boyfriend did this? He would never hit a woman,ever. The bruising doesn't look like a tree branch hit you. Fine. Okay,you guys are gonna think I'm really weird, but I was sort of up in the tree when the lightning hit, and,well...you climbed a tree in a thunderstorm? I really wanted it to be a surprise,you know, for my boyfriend,and, um,I just...I had to see if his psycho dog was in the yard because of,like, the barking and stuff and... I know.It sounds really weird. Does it sound really weird? -Not at all. -No. And the thing is, I mean,he wasn't even there. The dog? No,my boyfriend. He wasn't even home. I really shouldn't have gotten out of bed. Oh,dr. Shepherd. I've got a 34-year-old male with a blunt head trauma and severe case of O.C.D. Oh,really? Did you call for a psych consult? -Yes. -All right,let me know when you get his C.T. -Okay. -Thank you. Hey. Hey. Hey,uh,sorry about that, uh,valve replacement. Oh,thank you. The laundry lost my caps. The guy didn't die because you weren't wearing one of your caps. Fine,I know that. I just prefer... to operate wearing my own. It's a comfort thing. Huh. Well... I prefer having george out of our apartment. So I guess we both have comfort things. What are you saying? Uh,you know,um... I have one of your caps in my locker. Why do you have one of my caps in your locker? Oh,that's not the point. You know,the point is,uh, is that I think I'm gonna keep it hostage. So you kick bambi out, you get your cap back. Oh,well,I don't do well with ultimatums. Maybe you should think of it more as a trade. Dr. Burke... I've got free time. Do you have any cases? Do you need any help? Actually,I do. cristina has something of mine, and I need you to get it back. just call catherine back. Yeah. Gretchen,would you mind leaving us alone for a minute? Okay. Thank you. She's my new baby. Six months sober. She's already on the ninth step. You must be proud. Always. You're on the transplant list,ollie? Couple of years now. The sclerosis prevents blood from flowing into your liver, so it's backing up into your esophagus, 'causing the ruptures. It's serious,ol. Well,of course it is.I mean,you don't puke blood if it's not serious. The question is, can you treat it? Maybe.Surgically. We'll have to run more tests and... whatever we do, it's a stopgap. You need a new liver. Yet another reason I shoulda laid off the sauce. you look scared. I am scared,ollie. I haven't seen you at a meeting in awhile. I know,I know. How have you been? We're talking about you. Now I'm asking about you. Ellis grey's daughter is working at the hospital. Ellis is in a nursing home with alzheimer'S. I try to go see her every chance I get. You're having an affair with the woman who drove you to your alcoholic bottom? Ollie,we're not having an affair. She's sick. -You're lying to your wife? -I'm not lying. You're lying by omission. You are having an emotional affair and now you're lying to your sponsor about it. You haven't been my sponsor in years. I still have the right to bust your ass if I see you slipping. I'm not slipping. Not yet,but you're making a pretty big mess. How many years you have now? Just passed 17. I'm proud of you. And I'm scared,too. You got me sober,ollie. You walked me through it. And I'm gonna walk you through this. she still has the... You're a pervie little boy,george, and you're not finding the cap. I'll do your dishes for a month. -I don't do dishes. -I'll do your laundry. I don't do laundry. Maybe that's why burke likes having me around so much. Interesting,interesting. Are you having sex with him? No. Then he likes having me around more. Why does it always have to be a competition? -What do you want for the cap? -You outta the apartment. I'm not leaving till burke says I have to leave. Then you're not getting the cap. Now clean up my crap. No. Wow. Is that her spleen? Looks like a grade iii laceration, maybe a iv. What was she doing standing under a tree in a thunderstorm? She wasn't standing under it. She was climbing it. Why? Uh... I'm getting the feeling she's a little bit of a stalker. Do we need to call the police? I don't think so. I think she's more of a "gentle" stalker than a "kill you with a knife" stalker. Right. Well,let's hope she lives to gently stalk another day. Hey,you don't believe in that seven fatally thing,do you? I believe this girl needs her spleen removed immediately. Go pick up her labs and get her on the board. Then we'll break the news. it's almost over. You like horses,izzie? Everybody likes horses. That's not true. You know,horses are a great judge of character. You don't like horses, it means they don't like you. I've got an uncle that's a rodeo cowboy. No kiddin'? This is a big clot,denny. I can't get it with a catheter. I'm sorry.We're gonna have to open your chest again. I was counting the clicks-- the turn signal clicks. I couldn't move till it hit 333. The light was green, but I couldn't move. I can't blame them for hitting me. How long have you been feeling these compulsions? A little bit all my life,but it's been out of control the last three years. Onset at 30 is typical. Ruined a marriage. I can't hold a job. mr. Fannon, do you-- is it clean? -I need to know if it's clean. -It's very clean. Any relatives with O.C.D.? My mother. Killed herself at 38. It ruined her life, now it's ruining mine. clean,clean clean? I--we clean it between each patient. I think he needs you to say, "clean,clean,clean." It's clean,clean,clean. Thank you. I know it's annoying. I can't help it. Find a penny,pick it up. All day long, you'll have good luck. Find a penny,pick it up. All day long, you'll have good luck. Mr. Fannon, do you want-- repetitive rhymes,prayers-- it's classic. He feels he needs to say it a specific number of times, probably a multiple of three. Let's get him in before he decides to start again. Is everything all right with,uh,that? Find a penny,pick it up. All day long, you'll have good luck. Just don't look at him. Hey. Hi. -Hey-- -oh,hey. -Hi. -Hi. I,uh... have to -yeah. -Yeah. I do,too. Yeah,I got something,too, so... I wish I had good news. The T.I.P.P.S. Procedure you had last month failed. What does that mean? It means you're lucky you got sober young. Ollie,it means I'm gonna have to put in a portacaval shunt. It's complicated. Has only a 50% survival rate. What's my other choice? Okay,then.  Um... you'll be the one to do it? I've performed this surgery nine times, had four patients survive. It's perfect then. I'll be your five out of ten. I'm not having surgery today. You have a ruptured spleen. And I am sure that the spleen is very important, but I am not having surgery today. You can operate after midnight, but not one minute before. Ms. Ratlin,if I thought it would be safe, I'd be more than happy to wait till after midnight. However,I have a husband and a baby at home who won't be happy. You know who else won't be happy? You. Your spleen is bleeding. Spleen trumps horoscope. But it was more than just my horoscope. I went out to my car this morning-- flat tire. That's a sign, but I just changed the tire. Then there's a wreck on the freeway. Do I turn around and go home like it's telling me to? No. I detour an hour out of my way so that I can get to kevin's house. And when I get to kevin's house, I get struck by lightning. But you weren't struck by lightning. I'll die,okay? If you operate on me today, I will die. 'Cause I know I will. Please,just... just call my boyfriend and tell him that I'm having an operation at midnight, because he will want to be here. Okay. Please. Should I call psych? You can give it a shot. In the meantime,get her down to I.C.U. Poor girl's gonna kill herself tryin' not to die. Izzie paints a pretty picture 'cause she likes you,you know? Okay. I'm just sayin', she likes you. Which is gonna be hard on her. You mean... when I die? Come on... I'm askin' you, man-to-man. With a clot in your pulmonary artery, it'll cut off the oxygen to your lungs and you'll die of hypoxia. If the hypoxia doesn't kill you, the strain on your heart will. And the surgery? It's not a routine procedure. You're at serious risk for bleeding because of the anticoagulants already in your system. What I'm saying is izzie likes you. And she's not gonna be the one to pull away. XXXXXXXX Wanna know why? 'Cause he couldn't move his car until he stopped counting. My girl--ruptured spleen-- won't have surgery because of her horoscope. Oh. Well,we should introduce them. They'd make a nice, crazy couple. Oh,you know what? I'm sitting with meredith. Have some self-respect. Dr. Burke's orders trump any personal issues I might have. Is the craziness rubbing off on him? He's trying to stalk burke's lucky cap out of me. Burke has hat juju? Apparently. And you're using it against him? Well, they're forcing me to... because of the clarinet playing and the running and all the breakfast food. You guys... this whole death cluster thing is just ridiculous,right? I mean,just 'cause four died today doesn't necessarily mean there's gonna be three more before midnight. -It doesn't,tinkerbell? -For reals? Are you worried about denny? Yeah. Of course I am. He's my patient. I mean,if you're asking me if I'm "worried about denny," no. I'm sleeping with alex,so... it's just... hey,did burke say anything to you about denny's surgery? Did he? No,it's your case. Yeah. I know. I'm just asking,you know, as your boyfriend,did he-- well,I don't know why you care. I mean,you're sleeping with alex,right? Yeah. Right. Whatever. I'm just saying... there's no such thing as a death cluster. It's just stupid. Right? I have to go convince my patient to let us operate. You're removing part of my skullcap? Do you really have to do that? It's the only way I can get to the affected part of the brain. And the operating room, it's clean,clean,clean? Yes,it's clean, clean,clean. I'm gonna go get ready. Can you stop that,please? No. Sorry. I wish I could. She's judging me. -No,she's not. -Yes,she is. I've been living with this for three years, and it's always the people who are most like me who judge me the most. You're type "a," right? Straight-a student, top of your class? Yes,I was. Well,so you've managed to turn your compulsions into something productive. But we're cut from the same cloth. That's why you can't stand me. Oh,time to go. -But I'm not done. -Uh,yes,you are,sir. How many do you have to do? -96. -Let him finish. Fine. I'll see you in the O.R. hey. Ollie says you should come in. She says you need a meeting. Not now,not here. Yeah,except she said to tell you not to protect your anonymity over your sobriety. god... grant me the serenity to accept the things that I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. -Amen. -Amen. Amen. Hey. How are you feelin'? Do me a favor. My will is inside my nightstand. Just make sure it gets in the right hands,okay? Why are you talking about your will? We have to be realistic, dr. Stevens. Dr. Stevens? We gotta be realistic. And if you can't, well,I can. No,wait. Um,can you just wait one minute? Denny,denny, listen to me, you're not gonna die. You can't go into surgery thinking you're gonna die. You want me to pee in front of you? Is that what you want? -You have it on you. -Oh,really,you wanna go there? I wanna go there. So what are you gonna do,bambi? You gonna,like,what,take it from me? Well,burke said to do whatever I have to do, and I am gonna do whatever I have to-- george,it's not there. It's not there. -no,you're not gonna get it. -Maybe it's in here. You're not gonna get it. No. I got it. I got it. Oh,you're getting my breast. That's my breast,my breast. My breast.That's my breast,damn it. hey,dr. Torres. Dr. O'malley,you're aware this is the women's restroom? -Yes,ma'am. -Good. Dude, you called her "ma'am." She's never gonna sleep with you now. Oh,hey. Have you seen burke? He's on the phone with the laundry. They still can't find his scrub caps. That's what I gotta tell him. Cristina won't give hers back. Unless I'm ready to hit a woman, and even though it's cristina, I'm not ready to cross that line. Wait. Wait a moment. Cristina has one of burke's scrub caps? She's holding it hostage. Why do you think I am stalking her? ow. Ow. You're touching me. George says you have burke's scrub cap. -So? -Give it to him. -No. -Give it to him,cristina. -What is with you? -He needs it to operate. -No,he doesn'T. -That isn't your decision to make, not when he's going in on denny. Now are you gonna give it to him or am I gonna physically take it from you? Are you threatening me? I swear to god,cristina, I like you,I really do, but I grew up in a trailer park, and I am not above kicking your pampered little beverly hills ass. And I do mean physically kicking your ass. you don't have to follow me. Thank you. How long have you had this? It's one of my favorites. You know, you don't need it. I keep that cap in my locker because every morning, I look at it, and I'm reminded of what I'm here for and what I want to be-- a great surgeon, a surgeon who is decisive and who executes and who doesn't need a piece of clothing to give him an edge in surgery. You don't need it. I know. You're right. I know I'm right. Nicely done,o'malley. Let's go scrub in. How am I doin'? Nikki,is it possible you're misreading the signs? I mean,isn't two surgeons telling you that you need surgery a sign that you need surgery? Did you call my boyfriend? I did. What did he say? He said he hasn't been your boyfriend in awhile. Did you tell him I got struck by lightning? -What did you say to him? -Who? You know who. What the hell? Why does denny think he's dying? Well,maybe 'cause there's a good chance he is. Just so we're clear, we're over,alex. This is over. Oh,you're breaking up with me over a corpse. No! No. I am breaking up with you because on your very best day... that corpse... is twice the man you will ever be. You're not good enough for me,alex. You're not good enough for anyone. You two... you're not scrubbing in. Whatever is going on with you, I don't need it in my O.R. Fine. I'll watch from the gallery. No,no,you won'T. You will take your energy as far away from my O.R. As you can get. Both of you. Find a penny,pick it up. All day long, you'll have good luck. Find a penny,pick it up. All day long, you'll have good luck... we're gonna give you your anesthetic now. I'm sorry, but we have to start. Find a penny,pick it up. All day long... it's a beautiful afternoon for saving lives,people. Let's have some fun. The incision begins along the left subcostal margin, across the right rectus and extending well into the flank. Dr. Bailey. It's nikki ratlin. I'll be all right, dr. Bailey. Go. She's bleeding out. We need to get her to the O.R. Now. I don't want an operation. Nikki, your boyfriend called. He said he doesn't want you to die. Kevin called? Yes. Now will you let us operate? Nikki. Code blue. Charge to 200. Hang more blood. Clear. We have the back row of sutures in place. Give me some... clear field. -Pressure's dropping. -Hang another unit. I need the field clear. Clear. charge to 300. Clear. Gel foam. That clip should've done it. I don't know. There's something I'm missing. He's losing pressure, dr. Burke. I'm working as fast as I can. We're losing him. I heard they're dying left and right. See? I told you there'd be seven. Who? Who died? I don't know. I bet it was that spleen chick. You hear she wouldn't let them operate? My money's on the chief's shunt. I have $20 says burke's guy went down. The dude is a walking time bomb. bet. that makes five. You lost her? Yeah. I heard there's a number six. Do you know who else? No. I'm going to inform the family. She made it through. thank you. -Thank you so much. -Thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. superstition lies in the space between what we can control and what we can'T. so I wasn't one of the seven. It's past midnight. There were only six. You cryin'? I'm not crying. You are,too. Oh,damn it. I cannot fall for a patient. Oh. Okay. Good luck with that. Find a penny,pick it up and all day long, you'll have good luck. o'malley... you are a sad excuse for a man. Excuse me? I know you heard me. You're like a whiny little girl. Alex... you know why he's not speaking to you. Because he's not over you. Man,you got laid. It went badly. A man would move on. But you--you mope around this place like a dog that likes to get kicked. You make me sick! And if it wouldn't get me thrown outta the program, I'd smash your pathetic little face right into that locker. No one wants to pass up a chance for good luck. But does saying it 33 times really help? Is anyone really listening? If you feel that strongly about o'malley, I'll ask him to leave tonight. No,don'T. -I thought you wanted him out. -I do,but... not tonight. Scrub cap. Oh. Thank you. And if no one's listening, why do we bother doing those strange things at all? Hi. I didn't call. I shoulda called. I just... hi...this is george o'malley calling. You gave me your phone number. I know I shoulda called sooner, but I'm calling now. And I just want to know, maybe you want to go out with me sometime. Because... I...love to watch you set bones. And I--oh,I rarely spend that much time in a women's restroom. And... I really like you. So... is that a yes? We rely on superstitions because we're smart enough to know we don't have all the answers... -hey. -Hey. I'm sorry to hear about your patient. Thank you,addison. And that life works in mysterious ways. Here you go,babe. thank you. -You ready? -Yeah.Here you go. Thank you. Don't dis the juju... from wherever it comes. Grey's Anatomy  Season 02 Episode 22
