Then he sleeps with oliviainstead of me. I'm having a baby, too. Yes, i am, a little boy. You lied to me. You'llbe a better doctor for it. I'm lonely, derek. I can't. When derek broke with you, i was there. All i ever am is there for you guys, and the one time i need you... are you okay? I failed the medical boards. Karev, it's over, it's done. You screwed up. If i take the exam for a second time, and i don't pass... you will no longer be a surgical resident at seattle grace. it's an urban myth that suicide rates spike at the holidays. Turns out,they actually go down. experts think it's because people are less inclined to off themselves when surrounded by family. looks like santa threw upin here. Just... go with it. We're being supportive. Oh, hey! What do you think? Did i go too overboard? Oh, i know. I know sometimes i can go a little overboard. - No, it's great. - No, we love it. I love christmas. - We know. - Clearly. Ironically, that same family togetherness is thought to be the reason that depression rates actually do spikeat the holidays. yeah, okay,izzie doesn't count. oh, i thought you might like to help me decorate it tonight, to mark our first christmas together. I'm jewish. Seriously? My stepfather... saul rubenstein? Oh. Right. Right. Right. Look at her belly. She's almost as wideas she is tall. Are her ankles swollen? Is that why she's waddling? What's gonna happen to us when she goes on leave? leave? She's going on leave? What do you think happens when people push babies out of their vaginas? Do you think we're gonna geta new resident? Nah, they'll probably just let us all wander around unattended to see how much damage we can do. Yeah, well, you would know. Hey, you guys, we should all get together and get bailey a christmas gift for the baby or we could organize some sort of secret santa thing. Listen, tiny tim, you cantake your... - Secret santa sounds great, izzie. - Okay. We're being supportive. - You okay? You seem... - yeah. You know... holidays. I do know. Tim epstein, 38, fell offthe roof of his house. I was stringinghannumas lights, and a shingle came loose. Hannumas? Hannumas, chrismukkah. We go all out. Awesome. He fell 12 feet. The good news is, my head broke my fall. Uh, there areno visible deformities, but he's definitely having some focal left arm weakness. He'll probably be fine. He'salways been a little hardheaded. does your head hurt when you laugh? Is that a bad thing? Follow my finger with your eyes, please. I know karate. you know what? Your husbandmight need a little quiet, - so there's a cafeteriaright down... - no, no, let 'em stay. Pain or no,i don't wanna miss out on the holidays with my kids. Who'd like to take mr. Epsteindown for a c. t.? Stevens it is. - should we have a dog? - No dog. Come on, get a dog. Nadia shelton, 41, schedud for excision of her gastric ulcer. Lot of good it's done us. She's been scheduledfor three days. - Mom, it's not his fault. - Every day shegets rescheduled for some emergency. We're very, very sorry for the inconvenience. Inconvenience? You watch your child spend three days in pain, and then come and talk to me about inconvenience. We get a lot of trauma cases at the holidays. Your daughter's ulcer isserious, but it's non-emergent. Is that the news? Are you saying my wife's not important? Is that what he's saying? Is that what i'm hearing? When are you taking her in? Grandpa,it's not the remote. We have reservations to eat at the top of the space needle. - We've had them for months. - All right! Dr. O'malley,prep mrs. Shelton for her ulcer excision - which will happen this morning. - Thank you! grey, karev, cover the pit. You can expect all sort sof holiday idiocy, so that is my gift to you. Yang... dr. Bailey, u. n. o. s. Just called. They have a donor heart for a patient of mine. Heart surgery. I'm free. I'm totally free, right? - I can do this. - I'm free. I'm available. No, you're not. You're covering the pit. - Yang, it's yours. - Thank you. Pit! Damn! Heart transplant. - Would've liked to have seen that - There's always tomorrow. - Yeah, maybe for you. - Meaning? I retake the boards tomorrow. I'm pretty sure i'm gonna fail, which makes today my last day here, and i get to spend it doing stitches in the pit. So when does hanukkah fall this year? Uh, no idea. Oh. Well, if there are any more traditions - you want me to be aware of... - oh, no, burke, seriously, i haven't observed religious holidays since i was old enoughto know better. good morning, justin. Marion. - Good morning. - Hi, dr. Burke. I'm here with good news,great news. - You don't mean that... - u. n. o. s. Called. We have a heart. Now i'll operate this morning. You hear that, baby? Santa claus is bringing you a new heart for christmas. Tell the fat-ass to give it to someone else. I don't want it. I'm sorry, dr. Burke. He's tired today. I'm tired every day, i hate christmas every day, and i'm not having another stupid operation. Justin, i know surgery can be frightening, but you need this heart. You've worn out your last one. His last one? Justin had a heart transplant as a baby, but his heart hasn't aged as well as he has. You understand that,justin? Your heart just can't keep up with you anymore. You need a new one. I don't care. I don't want it. Can you tell me why not? Anxiety attacks, aneurysms and ulcers. Must be december. Chief, adele just called. - Tell her i'm in... - she knows you're notin surgery, and she said to tell you, we are going to our niece's school pageant this morning. You have known about it for months, and after what you pulled on thanksgiving... and then she started using a great many words that i don't feel comfortable repeating. - Look, i have seven surgeons on vacation. - And there was omething about divorce. you'll have to cover my ulcer excision. Yes, sir. The woman is unreasonable. When did watching a 6-year-old dressed up like a wise man become... male, 44,had a gastric bypass. Three weeks post-op. Reported extreme pain when we found him. - Said something about fruitcake. - He must have torn his abdomen wide open. You're gonna have to fight me for this one. He's all yours. My parting gift. Okay, for your mom, i got a lambswool blanket, handmade in edinburgh. It's soft, comfortable. It says, "don't hate mefor hurting your son," - except with fabric. - Addie, you know my mom loves you. No, she used to love me. I've got a lot of ground to make up for with these gifts. So what do you think... plain or plaidor both? I don't know. Whatever, you know? I thought you love christmas shopping. I'm just really not in the mood for it right now, okay? Okay, well,how about french food and scottish cataloguestonight, around 9? Um, well, i guess that depends. - What time do we get outta here? - Dr. Shepherd? - Yes? - I have tim epstein'sc. t. Scans back. Ah, good. - What do you think? - It's not great. Honey, what do you think of this scooter? Excuse me, i need to takeher blood pressure. Do you have any questions about the surgery? Apart from when you'reactually gonna do it? - We're doing it now. - Good. - I'm sorry. - Don't apologize. - Do you have any questions? - No. I've had tee bleeding ulcersin the last five years. Yeah. I hope you read the art. - Yes. - Good. Dr. Bailey, a gastricperforation just came in. Damn. Uh, all right. - Take mrs. Shelton backto her room. - Seriously? Do i look likei'm kidding? Tell her we'll get to herthis afternoon. Grey, call the e. r. Tell them tosend him up, and then scrub in. - Alex karev, um,failed his boards, - and he's retaking themtomorrow. He can't study for a practicalby himself. If he fails again,he's out. Okay, go. - O'malley. - Yeah? After you drop her off, get backhere and scrub in. All right. - okay, justin... - i told you, i don't want the heart. Why are you doing this? 'Cause you need it, and until you're 18, your mother calls all the shots. My mother's a liar. You heard her. She said the heart came from santa claus. She shouldn't get to decide anything. Yeah, well, you could make a run for it, but the heart you have won't get you very far. - Are we ready? - Just about. How about you, buddy? Are you ready? If i die in the surgery, can you give this heartto some other kid? Not gonna happen, justin, not on my watch. Here we go. - And it was only one day ofoil. - And then what happened? It lasted eight whole days andnights. And it was a miracle. - I wanted to say that part. - Mr. Epstein, i'm sorry to interrupt. You remember dr. Shepherd? Um, should we talk more privately? No, just tell us. Is it bad? The fall has caused a subdural hematoma. I don't even know what that means. That means your dad... his brain is bleeding. Great. Look, there are some risks to this surgery. It has to happen before the bleeding gets worse. - What kind of risks? - See, the bleed is, uh, in an area of the brain that controls the speechand the motor control. We don't need an operation,okay? you know, jake,i think we do. - Hey, honey,you know something else? - What? We have a doctor named shepherd. Shepherd. Is that a sign from god or what? Look at that. Beautiful fit. Now all we have to do is figure out why he's so angry. If i had that mother, i'd be angry, too. Actually,i do have that mother. Well, his mother is not the problem here. She loves him. She never leaves. She also never listens. She doesn't know him. Justin is depressed. You heard him. He doesn't wanna live. I just hope he changes his mind before it's too late. Wait, what do you mean,too late? With all medical realitiesbeing equal, why does one patient live and another dies? I believe there's a mind/body/spirit connection, and if justin really doesn't want this heart, his body will reject it. Okay, let me get this straight. You don't justcelebrate christmas... you actually believein santa claus? Dr. Yang, go and schedule a psychiatric consult for our patient. - We're... we're not done here. - You are. I don't know. It hurts here and here and back here. Any chance you got hit by a truck and forgot about it? You're judged on bedside manner,alex. I wouldn't be surprised if that's why you failedthe last time. Could you be any more patronizing? - I didn't ask for your help. - Enough with the ego,you big baby. I gave up a surgeryfor this. Now like i said, it hurts here and hereand back here. Oh, and this morning, i noticed my poopwas a funny grayish color. Wow. That's all you can save of his stomach? Yep. If eating is what this man lives for, we should put himout of his misery. - Paging dr. Karevian. - What did you just say? Just... it's a joke. Kevorkian, karevian? Alex karev? I get the joke. I just don't think it's funny. You see this, o'malley? I make one mistake with this scalpel, and this man's dead. My husband... he makes mistakes at his job all the time. As far as i know, he's never killed anyone, but i have, and you will,and alex did. He made a math mistake, and a man died for it. You run that past your accountant, see how he'd feel if every mistake he made, someone ended up dead. But you don't have tolike alex. You don't haveto care about him. But you damn well have to be on his side. Hold that. what a great family. Hannumas. Chrismukkah. And how cute are those kids? Really, dr. Stevens? Chrismukkah? I think it's sweet. Do you happen to knowwhat time of year neurosurgeons are the busiest,dr. Stevens? No, there's a time of year? Well,there's no hard or fast rule, but brain injuries tend to pile up around the holidays, like our friend here. Folks fall off their roofs while they string up lights, or they go skating for the first time in a decade and break their heads open. And every year,people drive through blizzards to get to parties where they kiss germ-infected strangers under poisonous mistletoe, and then they get so drunk that they smash their heads through their windshield on their way home. Like i said, there's nohard or fast rule. - Does this hurt, mrs. Grey? - Yes, doctor. - How about here?Does it hurt here? - Yes, it does. Okay, seriously,if you're that lonely, there are excellent vibrators. - I can give you catalog. - He failed his boards. I'm helpinghim study. - You failed your practical? - Glad to knowyou keep a secret, grey. I kept your secret. It didn't do you any good. - He needs our help. - Oh, you're not serious. - What if that were you? - It wouldn't be. Well, what if it were? - It wouldn't be. - I have to go. - Be a patient. Do it for me. - Fine, but when tiny tim goes all norman bates on us, i'm blaming you. - Diagnosis? - Gallstones. Yes. i'm a 55-year-old man. I'm nauseousand i can't stop throwing up. Forget it, all right? I didn'task for anybody's help. Okay, evil spawn, you can nurse your pride, like you were being a nurse, or you can pass your test and be a doctor. Up to you. - Any abdominal pain? - Yes, from my giant fat belly all the way to my back. Oh, and i'm drunk. Hiccup, hiccup. I got another one for you. He tried to gift wrapa 70-inch tv for his wife? - Hernia? - Strangulated. Pretty ugly. Well, you just know the wife hates tv. - Grey, is that otherprojt covered? - I think so. Then scrub in. O'malley, go tell nadia shelton she's off the scheduletill tomorrow. - Till tomorrow? - Another day'snot gonna kill me, jimmy. - I promise tomorrowfor sure. - Today was for sure. - What's he saying? - He's saying they can'toperate till tomorrow! - Outrageous! - i cannot believe this!Ow. Can you please... could you please turn that down? - Your mother needs to rest. - Who are you, my dad? - Sir, could you please tell yourson... - don't talk to me about my son. Who the hell do you think you are? I'm really sorry. I think that your wife should rest. - I'm listening here! - I can't gochristmas shopping with my daughter. You people have ruinedeverything. I hope you're happy. I'm very sorry. "I'm very sorry. " that cutsit here, doc. Thanks a lot. Yeah, okay, you're really grabbing me now. That's assault. This... is an exam pat. What... what the hell? Does izzie know? Does burke know about this? Unbunch your panties, george. We're helping alex study. Do it. I can't hear you when his hand is on your boob. Take your handoff my boob, alex. Thank you. - Study for what? - Shut it, yang. - Alex failed his boards. - Seriously? I failed one part of one board. That's it. Still,that's pretty embarrassing. Eh! He's all yours, georgie. Do your worst. You're not giving me a rectal. Do not ask me to cough. You page me? I didn't see a psych consultscheduled here. I couldn't get one. I tried to, but they told meto come back in january. You disrespected me. You mocked me in my o. r. That can't happen. I... it won't happen again. You equated my spirituality - with a belief in santa claus. - Burke, science isthe one thing, you know? It's the one thingwe have in common. I'm an intern. You're not. I'm a slob,and you're not. I say i wanna keep our relationship private, and you go and tell the chief of surgery and you ask meto move in with you, and now you're religious. Spiritual. There's a difference. Well, not to me. I don't knowwhat we're doing. Well, right now we're working. Page meif he spes a fever. Tell mrs. Davison to hire a private therapist or a priest anyone justin would talk to. Mrs. Epstein? - How is he? - He's gonna be fine. - He's stilla little groggy, but... - my dad wants to see me now,okay? - Okay. Come on in. - Okay. - We have to run, run, run fast. - Yeah, let's run, run, run. Let's run and see daddy. It's okay, guys. Daddy's okay. Daddy! Daddy! I could kiss it better,daddy. Jillian, i have a headache. - I'll sing for you, daddy. - No. no, leah. Damn it, leah, shut up! I can't standthat insipid song! - Tim! - Just get out! Get out! Get the hell out of here,all of you! You stupid shepherd, you brokemy dad's brain! how did that happen? I mean, his personality... you didn't go any where nearthe frontal lobe. Well, the c. t. Might havemissed something, or the personality change could be a reactionfrom the anesthesiawearing off. - It could be the pain. - He was in painbefore the surgery. Watch himfor a couple hours. If he doesn't improve,get a new c. t. Okay. Dr. Stevens? You had his brain open,literally open. He was laying there unconscious and vulnerable... and you think i poisoned him with my antl-holiday venom? Well, you're the one that's always saying there's a lot about the brain that we don't know. How do you know that your words didn't speak to him on some unconscious level? I mean, he trusted youto be his shepherd. Dr. Stevens, you should be a little embarrassed. - I am. - Good. Oh, this is the c. c. u. There are no trees allowedin the c. c. u. I know, but it's neverreally been enforced, so... how's he doing? Uh, surgery went smoothly, but it's too soon to tell. He's really a good boy,you know? You just met himat a difficult time. He's been down. I don't know why, but father michael will be able to talk to him. No offense,but your son doesn't seem to be a fan of the holidays. He doesn't believe in santa. Yes, well, a mother's job is to protec ther child's innocence, and this christmas could be his last time, so... that's what you said last year and the year before that. Baby, you're awake! You look great! My big, strong boy. Santa ought you backto me. - What are you doing? - Sorry, c. c. u. Regulations. - Are we using mesh? - Yes, the conjoined tendonis... Dr. Bailey? Just wouldn't want to throw upin the body cavity. Dr. Bailey, are you all right? Mnh. - Do you need... - i just... i need a minute, grey. Oh, when you operate, the rest of e worldgoes away... hunger, thirst, pain. You don't feel itin the o. r., but it's not that way when you're sharing your body with another person. Okay. Deaver retractor. Are you sureyou don't want me to go find someoneto take over for you? What i want you to find meis a strawberry milkshake,extra thick. - Seriously? - Yeah, nausea comeswith the hunger, grey. Go. My throat... it's, like, wicked sore, yo! Plus, i goall thesesick breakouts, right? Dude, seriously... all right, all right, sit down, sit down. Open up your mouth. I'd like to inspectyour tonsils. What's wrong with you? Are you sick? Fix it. I failedmy practical board exam. O'malley's helping me study. You failed your... - you're helping him? - Just to study, nothing else! Izzie... no, you don't getto say my name, and you are unbelievable! I was doing mono, the wholefever and glands thing. The acne was just part of the whole teenager thing. - Izzie, would you wait? - I say i like the guy, and you can't stop hating him. - Izzie, you... - and assoon as he screws me ov... - izzie... - you're his new best friend. He failed his boards. This is important. - He cheated on me! - Busted? - Yeah, i'm busted. - His exam is tomorrow. You're in on this, too? He cheated on me, god! Told you she'd find out. Oh,of course you're in on this. She let him touch her boobs! Oh! He cheated on me with george's skanky syph nurse! - That is just plain rude! - We know he cheated on you. That's why we let you turn the living room into santa's freakin' village. - What? - We're not big on holidays! You know that, but we'retrying to be supportive, because you're havinga hard time. But right now, alex, he's having a harder time. Why does everybody care whatkind of time alex is having? Because he'sdirty uncle sal. - You lost me. - Sorry, what? He's dirty uncle sal, the one who embarrasses everyoneat family reunions and who can't be left alone with the teenage girls, but you invite him to the picnic anyway. - I'm still lost. - Sorry, what? I have a mother who doesn't recognize me. As far as family goes, this hospital,you guys are it, so i knowyou're pissed at alex, but maybe you could try to help him anyway, sort of like in the spiritof this holiday you keep shovingdown everybody's throats. You... - what? - Boob? - Somebody get in here! - Doctor!Get in here now! - Get in here! Where is he? - Do something! Do something, doctor! I'm takingyou to surgery. Prep her now. - It's about time. - Sorry. I got sidetracked. Nadia shelton'sulcer perforated. She's vomiting bloodby the pint. - Is the chief back? - Haven't seen him. -No. All right, uh,both of you scrub in. I'm gonna needall the help i can get. well, there it is... left side of his frontal lobe. Now why didn'twe see that before? Intracerebral bleeds can havea delayed presentation. Right. You wantto get him out of there? Uh, just prep an o. r. I'm gonna talk to his wife. Dr. Stevens. Nice talking to you. Think she'll ever talkto me again? Okay, am i invisible? I'm feeling strangely invisible. - Also inaudible. - What? Another surgery? So i guess dinner-shoppingis out? Yeah, it's not gonnahappen tonight. - Sorry. - No, you're not. I'm just trying to figure out why you're not. - It's christmas, derek. - Yeah, i know. It's our season!What's going on? Are you mad? Are you depressed, what? No. Mr. Epstein hereis depressed. He's bleedingfrom his frontal lobe. Everything's fine. We're fine, addie. You know, just... i'll see you at home, okay? You need a second surgery,mr. Epstein. The frontal lobeis difficult. We may be ableto improve things,but, uh, you should be prepared for the possibility that things could get worse. That's great,that's just great. I am so gladwe came to this hospital, so i could be treatedby a bunch of quacks who don't know their asses from the inside of my skull! This isn't my husband. This is not my husband. He doesn't speak to methis way. He doesn't speak toanyonethis way. I know this is difficult,mrs. Epstein, but the important thingright now is that we stop the bleeding. Look,he's the love of my life. And i know that you have a lot of other patients and you doa lot of other surgeries, but he's the loveof my life. Just... i just need your wordthat you'll treat this changein my husband's personality as seriouslyas you would fatal cancer, because that's the waythis feels to me and my kids. And we're happy. We're a happy family. It just... if you could just fix it... just fix it. Mrs. Epstein,i'm gonna do everythingin my power,all right? Okay? I didn't want it. I already got one new heart. I didn't deserve another one. Justin, you don't haveto feel guilty about having a new heart. God wants you to live. That's why he sent youthe heart. I'm not stupid, okay? God didn't send me the heart, - and there's no suchthing as god. - Justin! Marion, marion. It's all right. The heart i have now... my mom told me the heartcame from santa. I thought elves made itin their factory or whatever, but that's not true,is it? - No, it isn't. - Yeah. I heard the nurses talking. Where it really came from is some other kid. Some other kid had to die so i could live. Justin... baby... and theni outgrew that kid's heart. So for the last two years my mom has been praying that another kidwould die for me. That's what you pray forall the time, isn't it, mom? How does god feel about that? - Justin, justin... justin? - justin, baby? Wake up, justin! Nurse! Move, please!No, no, no! - Code blue! - Please, justin! Just stay back. Dear god, please! Justin, baby,i'm right here! - Justin, i love you, baby! - Please shut her up! He's in v-fib. Charge the paddles to 100. - Charge. Clear. can you get him back on the donor's list? - I mean, if it's a bad heart. - It's not a bad heart. Well, can you get him back on the list? He's waited two yearsfor this heart. He has to fight for it. - He has to decide he wants tolive. - Okay, medically speaking, is there anything else we haven't talked about? The way you're feelingright now... it's why i have to believe in something bigger in me. Because if i didn't, that powerlessnesswould eat me alive. Drill, please. Any danger with two craniotomiesin one day? No more than with one. - Is there any music? - Any requests? Christmas carolsor hanukkah. Is there such a thing as hanukkah carols the brain is a my sterious thing,dr. Stevens. You ner know what may penetrate the psyche. - whoa, look at that. - kissing ulcers. One's perf. The other one is bleeding. Two ulcers. I'm not surprisedwith that family. I should've thrown them out. Why didn't i throw them out? That's whati should have done. I don't know why i didn't. Stop whining, o'malley. You had your chance. You didn't take it. Move on. Right, sorry. - Do not kick me! - Excuse me? Are you kicking me under the table, o'malley? - No! - Then clearlyi wasn't talking to you. You cannot kick me while i'm doing my job. Thank you. wake up! God, no wonderyou failed your boards. What, do you expect to learnthis stuff by osmosis? What are you doing here? I'm a farmer, okay? I've been drooling and pukingand crapping my pants. - You came hereto help me study? - Well, i'm not actuallycrapping my pants now, am i? Well, why would you want to help me after what i did? Because it's what jesuswould freakin' do! you know, i don't believe in santa either, justin,or god. I believe in medicine, and it's a medical miracleyou're alive. With the heart you had, you should have... you should have died about two weeksafter you were born, except some surgeonfigured out a way to give yousomeone else's heart, which is so much coolerthan santa. so i'm just saying i think you should decideto live, live so you can becomea doctor, and you can find a way to do heart transplantswithout someonehaving to die. Or you know,live so you can grow up and have kidsand u know what? Raise them not to believein santa. Now that would pissyour mom off. just decide to live. Because in your case, dying really isn'tthe best revenge. - How is she? - Is she gonna be all right? She lost a lot of blood, but we were able to replace itand repair the tear. She's gonna require several days' observation, but she should havea full recovery. - Oh, thank god. - Thank god is right. 'Cause we're certainly not gonna thank you. We should sue youfor all you're worth. We sat here and sat here ansat here and sat here... you want to help me out? - Really? - And watched you takepatient after patient... you got your second chan. Just don't screw it up. ...while you made my daughter wait for three whole daysfor her operation! I should sue you and this whole damn hospital! Okay, yeah,you could sue us, or you could just considerthe possibility - of just shutting the hell up. - What did you say to me? - Did you hear what he said to me? - I heard him! - You can't talk to an old ladylike that. - Where is my daughter? - I'd like to see her. - Well, you can't. I'm her doctor. She is my patient,and this is a hospital, which is the kind of place where people can generally use a little peace and quiet, so no, right nowyou can't see her. And i am not saying this because you just threatenedto sue dr. Bailey, who spentthe last several hourssaving your daughter's life,saving your wife's life. I am saying this because she is my patient, and she isin the recovery wing of this hospitaltrying to recover, and visiting hours are over, so good nightand merry christmas. Interns. Too emotional. My apologies. Um, is the nausea constant or intermittent? Constant. When... when did it first start? After i workedin the fields all day. Do you have any allergies you're aware of? No. Izzie... i never wanted to hurt you. You didn't hurt me. I don't even know you. I'm a farmer. You... you're still the patient? What does it look like? It's organophosphates, pesticide poisoning. Crying's a symptom. That's it, right? Right. You okay? Yeah, yeah. - You know, holidays. - Yeah. I do know. - Merry christmas. - Merry christmas. Hey. Christmas double scotch,single malt. You're a good man. hey, dr. Shepherd. Dr. Shepherd. so... how's mr. Epstein'sfrontal lobe? He woke up smiling. - Congratulations. - Thank you. What are you drinking? - It's hot buttered rum. It's delicious. - It's dickensian. Oh, well, yeah,it is christmas. Christmas, derek. We love christmas. At least we used to. Christmas makes you want to bewith people you love. I'm not saying thisto hurt you or because i want to leave you, because i don't. Meredith wasn't a fling. She wasn't revenge. I fell in love with her. That doesn't go away because i decided to stay with you. There's an old proverb that says you can't chooseyour family. you take what the fateshand you. and like them or not,love them or not understand them or not... justin took a turn. His fever's down,and his b. p. Is up. i wonder whatgot through to him. i don't know. ...you cope. Pretty. Yeah. Then there'sthe school of thought that says the familyyou're born into - is simply a starting point. - What are we doing? Lights. they feed youand clothe you and take care of you
