You think we're gonna get a new resident? My mother is very sick. I'm the only person she'll allow to see her. Cujo has to go! hey,doc. Hey,buddy. Thanks for doing this. He'll be fine. I grew up in a trailer park, put myself through med school by posing in my underwear. I walk into the O.R., Everyone hopes I'm the nurse. the nurses are overworked and unhappy. Sorry,we're short staffed. Unhappy nurses lead to... I don't even want to think about it. We go on strike in ten days. in surgery there is a red line on the floor that marks the point where the hospital goes from being accessible to being off-limits to all but a special few. Crossing the line unauthorized is not tolerated. Fair hours! Fair wages!..... can'T... can't cross the picket line. I don't like it either,george, but what choice do we have? Okay,you took an oath to heal. You're a healer. My dad's a truck driver. Mom's a teacher. The evening news shows me crossing a picket line, they'll outlive me just to pee on my grave. In general,lines are there for a reason... has there been any blood yet? I hear they brought in scab nurses. For safety... for security... for clarity. I think the nurses know that we are on their side. -Don't they? -We're doctors. We have sick patients inside. I mean,we have surgeries. Okay... then you go first. screw it. fair hours! Fair wages!.... Yeah,doing my job. Doing my job. Ha ha. they threw food at her. That is just wrong! fine. I'm goin' in. Changes your own bedpans, stevens! Yeah,enjoy your syphilis,olivia. George,are you coming? No,I'm good here. If you choose to cross the line, you pretty much do so at your own risk. Good morning. Morning,meredith. How is she today? She's great. She really lights up when dr. Webber visits. and I did not back down. Not in my O.R.,Not in front of those jock ortho idiots. That was the last time windsor called you "little lady," not even behind your back. One day,I'm gonna be chief of surgery. The first woman chief, you watch. I don't doubt it,ellis. So why is it... I don't doubt it for a minute. that the bigger the line, the greater the temptation to cross it? Fair hours! Fair wages!.... And I can't say this enough-- charts are organized by room number. I know you're temp nurses, but there's no excuse for sloppiness. -Did they bring back edmonds' chart from physical therapy? -You know,I can't do my job without vitals on the chart. You know why I stopped being a nurse? Doctors. Doctors who don't know how to pitch in. Right. -This place is going to hell. -There should be a better way to compromise. We need the real nurses back. We need an additional 40 nurses to relieve the overtime that they're striking about. That's $2 million a year we don't have. Have you checkedunder the couch? I always find spare change under the cushions. Oh,okay. And I'm silencing myself. Yes,yes. Uh... that's him. He's published twice, and he's flawless. Oh,I don't want that guy. That guy's a freak. He doesn't let you speak in the O.R. Yeah,but he's flawless. I think it's him. What's his name again? Oh,yeah. Mouth breather guy. But he'll let you do a procedure on your own if he likes you. What are we doing? Trying to figure out who they're gonna pick for bailey's replacement. yang! Stevens...grey,o'malley,karev, here you are. I was looking for you guys in the locker room, but you weren't there. And then I thought,well,maybe my interns are looking for me,too. And then I come out here, and here you are. Yeah,you guys look like a great group,which is awesome. Because my horoscope said it was gonna be a very challenging day, and I was a little worried,but,no. You guys... yeah. You look like a good group. Which is great, 'cause we're gonna have so much fun. Hi! Hi. First of all,hi. Ow! Ow. Ow. Oh. Sorry. Am I hurting you? Uh,no,you're-- you're touching me. I'm sydney heron,fourth year, and,uh,my philosophy, uh,just so you know, is,um,is heal with love. Okay. So,wonderful. So alex,izzie, meredith,cristina-- and our little group is just missing-- o'malley. He's cowering behind the strike line like a little girl. Standing up for what he believes in. That's my kind of "little girl," right? So... the E.R. Needs somebody down there for a consult. Does anybody-- who wants to-- we get to pick? Oh,me. I'm on it. I'll help. I have patients I need to check on. So it looks like it's just you and me,izzie mcgee. Right. It's,um, it's stevens. Izzie stevens. Oh,no,I knew. I-I was just rhyming. Oh,rhyming. Right,yeah. That's--that's neat. -Dr. Stevens. -Yeah. Could use you on a consult. Okay,I'm on it. Absolutely. Yeah. You need a consult for a rash? It's spreading pretty fast. I wanted to make sure there's nothing surgical going on. Mrs. Solomon. Oh. Oh,god. Sorry. we're on our honeymoon. -Yeah. -Sweet. Uh,can you,um... dismount,please? Yeah. Okay,great. Just- -aah! l-len? Lenny... I-is that you? Lenny! are you okay,ma'am? "Grace bickham." Mrs. Bickham, do you know who your doctor is? -Lenny... -I don't see your chart here. Are you there? I'm gonna need you to calm down for me,okay? Lenny? Is that your husband? Oh,where is he? He was here. I'm sure he'll be back any moment. You're having some trouble breathing. I'm gonna need to run some tests. Lenny. Nurse! I need a nurse in here. Fair hours! Fair wages... you can go,george. We won't throw doughnuts. No,I can take the doughnuts. Then what are you still doing here? Teacher strike of '03, mom walked the line for 48 days. I can't just-- I can't cross. So go home. I can't go home. You just don't go... yeah,and get kicked out of the program, lose my place as a resident. No,I'm a doctor. Don't do... don'T... don'T... I'm a union guy. So that means... give me that sign. all right, dr. O'malley. Proudly Presents Sync: YTET-gagegao -==www.ydy.com/bbs==- .Greys Anatomy. Season02 Episode 15 help! I need a nurse in here,please. Her pressure's falling. She's stopped breathing. Whoa. Is she dying? Are you a nurse? Um,I'm,like,a nursing student. I need to intubate. Get me a 7 1/2 tube. They're out in the hall. Not that one. The that says "7-5." I'm in. Awesome. is that too much? It's a lot of extra amniotic fluid,cheyenne, but your baby looks strong. Does that mean we can go? I mean,I appreciate you seeing us,I really do, but this is a long drive for us, and I can't afford to miss another shift. Unfortunately,ms. Wood, the mass on the baby's neck is what's causing the build up of fluid. It's also obstructing her airway and the spine. Mom. It's all right. Let's listen. We're gonna do a procedure called an exit surgery. Basically,we do a c-section and only half deliver the baby. Half deliver? That's right. We pull the head and the arms out, but we don't cut the umbilical cord. Why? The tumor won't let air get to the baby's lungs, so we need the umbilical cord to keep her alive during the operation. It's kinda cool if you think about it. You'll be like your baby's life support machine. And then after the surgery, if all goes well, we cut the umbilical cord and you'll be the mother of a healthy baby girl. How's that sound? It sounds expensive. Well,your doctor at the clinic is a former student of mine, so... it's covered. I'm gonna go ahead and take this up to the lab. The hospital gets a write-off for the surgery, and it makes dr. Shepherd look good,so... so it's not charity? It's not charity. What time's your shift? 6:00 to 6:00. Graveyard. In chehalis? Yeah. That's three hours away. You better get goin'. I'll look out for her. Chief. Hello,meredith. Saw my mother this morning. Did you? How is she? She's fine. I'm glad to hear it. Give her my best. Why are you-- oh,I'm drawing a line to mark the borders of the infection. We'll watch you for a couple of hours, and if doesn't cross the line, you'll get I.V. Antibiotics. And if it does cross the line? Well,it would mean the infection's aggressive. We'd have to do a muscle biopsy. You have to take out a piece of my muscle? Mm-hmm. Well,we're supposed to run a 10k tomorrow,so-- oh,on this leg? I doubt it. Can you tell us when you first noticed the rash? When we were climbing rainier yesterday. wow,you go up the emmons glacier route? Please,you can do that in an S.U.V. We did liberty ridge. Wow. That's hard core. Hi,I'm sydney heron, these guys' teacher. Hi. I'm claire.This is wade. It's our honeymoon. Wow. That's amazing. God,and look at that rock. Did you sustain any trauma on the hike? Did you fall down or bang your leg against something? -No. -Well,um, she cut her foot on some oyster shells at the beach a couple days ago. We were windsurfing in puget sound. Oh,wow. Sounds like you guys are gonna need a honeymoon to recover from your honeymoon. Ow. Right? My leg's gonna be okay, though,right? Oh,yeah,yeah,it's probably just a simple skin infection. Uh,no it's not. Look. -Oh,hey. -Hey. Your dog's fine. He's your dog now. Hmm. I miss him. he misses you,too. you should come visit. The dog,I mean. I'm walking away now. So,um... I'm looking for a neurosurgeon to consult on a fetal spinal tumor. You know anybody good? don't ask george. -Why not? -He's a doctor. -I'm worried about-- -just ask. Whisper and point. I'm showing support, -they whisper and point. -George. What? We need a favor. Ava jenkins in peds--room 4114. It's almost time to change her dressing, and it's scary for her. But if you sing the alphabet or the wheels on the bus song, she can handle it. And mrs. O'brien from 2412, she'll have a major panic attack if they don't check on her at least once an hour. And there's this guy in 2924-- hang on! Hang on here. Wait,you want me to cross the picket line? -Yeah. -Yeah. Why? Because they're our patients,too,george. And we can'T. anyone care to probe the wound? -I do. -I do. I'd really like to try your method of healing with love. I like the way you think,alex. You do the honors. cristina,looks like someone needs to learn how to share. okay,good. Just go ahead and slide it in. Whoa. No resistance. Let me see. -dr. Heron. -Let me see. Yes. No healthy muscle gives way that easily. Oh,my god. Oh,this poor girl. Okay,everyone, we're locking down the O.R. All nonessential personnel must leave now. Is that pathology? Is it-- it's necrotizing fasciitis. The flesh-eating bacteria? In the flesh. Oh,good. Somebody's in here. How's she doing? You intubated her? Yeah. You intubated her? I had to--she was struggling to breathe, her sats were in the 80s, she was in a room all alone. What? One of the temp nurses found the paperwork from her chart on the second floor and-- you put a tube in grace. She put a tube in grace? She put a tube in grace? Mrs. Bickham was diagnosed with end-stage C.O.P.D. She's on hospice. End-of-life care? D.N.R.-- Do not resuscitate. You little schnook. You were supposed to let her die. "No machines," she said. She did,I remember. Because her daughter alice was there with her girlfriend-- uh,she's a lesbian, the daughter-- nice girls. Stop with the rambling,agnes. Make your point. I'm sorry. Who are you exactly? Mrs. Bickham's sisters? Oh,no. No,her sister rose died in '83. May she rest in peace. Influenza. Or croup. Only babies die of croup. Rose died with a cold in her chest. Pneumonia. Right,pneumonia. And then there was her other sister harriet. May she rest in peace. They cremated her. Gracie wanted to die. She made us all promise. This really is something that I need to speak with her husband about. Lenny never talked much when he was alive. Good luck gettin' a word now. Lenny's dead? May he rest in peace. But grace said she just saw him. Because she was trying to cross over. She almost died twice in the last month, said she saw him each time. You ask me, that's a little meshugana. It's not meshugana. He was waitin' for her in the light. Mm-hmm,which,thanks to you, she can't reach now. O'malley,I need you to round on room 20-- I'm not here. Excuse me? I'm here,but I'm not here. You won't be anywhere in about 30 seconds if you-- sir,all due respect, no offense intended,uh... but I won't cross a picket line. And yet somehow, you're standing in front of me. Well,yeah,because some of the nurses wanted me to check ontheir patients, and so I am,but then I'm going right back out there to join them. You're a doctor. Yes,sir. But I'm also a union man. All due respect. There's no offense intended. Fine. Sir... while I have you here, I'm supposed to tell you that,uh, mrs. O'brien in 2412 is allergic to chocolate, but she pulls the allergy sticker off her chart every chance she gets. -Wonderful. -And,uh, that mister--you're supposed to watch mr. Roberts in 2119 take and swallow his diuretics. Apparently he likes to hoard them under his mattress-- is that it? 40 to 50 hours of mandatory overtime is extremely-- o'malley. Yes,sir,I'm very sorry. There's no offense intended. What? Wait, flesh-eating... I mean,this is some kind of joke,right? She put you up to this? No,it's not a joke. We have to amputate the leg. Cristina... we're on our honeymoon. I'm sorry,wade.I know this is scary. But amputation is not the only option. It's the only sane op-- excuse me.If we don't get this infection under control immediately, she is going to die. But there's another option? well,we can try to save the leg by cutting out the infection. It won't be pretty,but we might be able to keep it functional. Gold star for dr. Karev. -I-I need to see her. -There's no time. By the time we take her out of anesthesia and put her back under-- you need to make a decision now. I mean,she runs marathons. This is our adventure honeymoon. It'S... I mean, it's who she is. Okay. Then we'll do everything we can to save the leg. You seriously think this is a good idea? I seriously think this is a way cooler surgery. Cheyenne,the prognosis is very good. So what we want to try to do is go in and get as much of the tumor out as possible during your surgery. So my baby will be fine? Yes. You may be able to take your baby home by the end of the week. That soon? Absolutely. She'll be all yours. Oh. -Okay. -okay. Now if you or your mother have any questions, dr. Stevens will page me,all right? see you later. Wow. Shakespeare. I was reading it to my baby. It's really homework for english. Was. The baby wasn't due for another three more weeks. But now I guess... no more school. It's weird. It's like when you're in school... you hate it. Until you can't go anymore. Have you made any plans? Plans? Bought a crib, called about child care, looked into assistance. Not yet. Are you gonna live with your mom? I was supposed to be saving money to get my own trailer home. But I don't know,I guess i just thought I'd have more time. Nine months goes by fast. Yeah. Yeah,it does. I'll see you later. Bye. So,sydney,have you seen a lot of necrotizing fasciitis? No,have you? If the infection moves to her bloodstream, she'll die. If she wakes up without her leg, she might wish she had. Yeah,dr. Karev is right. She's young,she's healthy, she's a newlywed. And your treatment plan is based on... cuteness? If she were an 80-year-old man, you'd amputate in a heartbeat. She's not 80. Where's your compassion? My compassion? Trying to save a patient from death is pretty compassionate. I must say, I'm disappointed in you. Why can't you be more like alex? Excuse me? Yeah. This guy, he's compassionate,he's warm. He's fighting with me to save claire's leg. And we're gonna win that fight. Yes. Um,excuse me. Restroom. Burke. Hey,I thought you were in surgery. I was. Necrotizing fasciitis. You're kidding? So why are you out here? Because the new resident-- she's the new bailey, except that she's the exact opposite of bailey in the most absurd, horrifying, profoundly disturbing ways. Cristina-- I think the new resident is killing our patient. Dr. Heron,is it? It is. And you are? Preston burke. Dr. Burke. Wow. No kidding? I'm a huge fan. Thank you. I,um, I heard you had a case of necrotizing fasciitis. We don't see a lot of those around here. Hmm,yeah,well,being a cardiothoracic surgeon, I wouldn't think you saw any. Right. Well,um... I was just curious on what protocol you were following here. You were curious or cristina was concerned? I hope you'll forgive the intrusion. It's nothing personal. It's just... we haven't worked with you before, and dr. Yang wanted to be sure that-- dr. Yang wanted to be sure that the perky little bimbo cheerleader wasn't in here trying to kill a patient, am I right? Now with all due respect, dr. Burke, I know you don't know me very well, but I'm pretty good at what I do. And my patient is a 25-year-old marathoner, and I've told her husband I'm gonna try and save her leg. So my plan is to stand here for as many hours as it takes to scrape away every last cell of necrotic flesh. Now when I'm done, if it's still spreading, then we'll take the leg, and if we do, then our eager young intern here can hold the saw. Now unlike dr. Karev, kindness and compassion aren't very high on her list of priorities, but a little bone saw action-- well, maybe that'll earn me some respect, am I right? Now,dr. Yang, you ready to scrub back in? Thank you. You're the head of this whole hospital? Just the surgeons. Well,they should make you the head of everything. She's batting her lashes. You see that? She's batting her lashes. Dr. Webber,the point is, grace wants to be with her lenny. She misses him terribly. You realize,if I pull out the tube,grace will die? We're old,magpie, not daft. Pull the plug already. It's what she wants. Ladies,I appreciate your concern for your friend, but we need to contact the durable power of attorney to sign the release. That's alice. Call alice. Grace's daughter. She's a lesbian. Well,that's okay,isn't it? I mean,she could still have the power of attorney. Uh,fine. But we'll need alice's signature. Good luck. She lives in oregon. Oh,she could fax it. I'm sorry,we'll need her original signature. Oh,can't we just skip that part? Bat the lashes again. I think it was working. excuse me,ladies. You're like the old lady whisperer. They really cheer up when you come around. Meredith,you understand if the daughter shows up tomorrow, confirms she's D.N.R. That-- I have to kill my patient, I know. How you doing? Something I can do for you? Oh,I'm fine,sir. I don't need any help from you. Thank you. "Sir,fare you well: "Hereafter, in a better world than this, "I shall desire more love and knowledge of you." to dr. O'malley! o'malley! whoo! she called me unkind-- unkind and lacking in compassion in front of my boyfriend. I am not unkind. I think I have to kill a woman tomorrow. I have to take out the tube that's keeping her alive. izzie. This is the part where you say what's wrong with you. I have to kill a woman tomorrow. You know,and that's a problem why? I mean,if it's what she wants, it's what she wants. And that is not unkind or lacking in compassion. I'm a very compassionate person. I'm more compassionate than you,alex. Oh,shut your pie hole,yang. Hey,joe,could we have another round,please? Yeah,give nurse o'malley a drink on me. what'd you say? Hey,uh,karev just called me a nurse. at least nurses aren't butchers. Is that the worst you could come up with? Oh,wait, was that an insult or was that,uh, supposed to be funny? Oh,whoops. Are you kidding me? I will kill you,you know that? Bring it on. Oh,jeez-- oh,"bring it on." Okay,mama. Let's bring it on. Oh,look,there's your squad. What,do you want to cheer it up,soccer mom? Oh,soccer mom. Are you gonna throw down some bed pans? -whoa,whoa,whoa. -Hey,hey,hey,hey,hey,hey. Hey! If you're gonna beat each other up, there's not gonna be anybody left to set your broken bones. That would be my job! Am I right? I'm right. I'm right.Hey! What hurts? It's a little bitty bone. we were just leaving. Yeah,'cause I gotta go save lives. Bye. -pardon me. -Excuse me. They're my ride. You're awake. Hey,yeah. The baby jumps up and down in my belly all night. Makes me have to pee all the time. You work long hours,huh? Yeah. But I'm off work now, only... I just came back to talk to you. I grew up in chehalis,too. -Serious? -Serious. Um,forest park. -The trailer park behind the church. -Yeah,behind the church on route 6,yeah. My friend shelley lives up there. Yeah,my mom still lives there. -No way. -Yeah. can you keep a secret? This is my daughter. Then at in the picture,she's 6, but she's 11 now. She lived in santa barbara, but they moved. I don't know where. But I know her name is hannah. And she likes pigs. -Pigs? -Yep. She collects them.Like figurines or stuffed animals,you know? I think it's probably because her mom read her "charlotte's web." I thought you were her mom. I'm her mother. But I'm not her mom. Look... I know that where we come from... this kind of thing doesn't get talked about. But I wanted you to know that there's more than one way to be a good mother. I wanted-- I wanted better for her than I could do at 16. I love my baby. Of course you do. But you're reading her shakespeare. When you're working 12-hour shifts at the diner like our moms, you won't be coming home and reading her shakespeare. I could hear you from six blocks away. Sorry. Don't be. I like it. Um,I'm just not sure how the neighbors would feel. Which... by the way, is not a thing someone lacking in compassion would be concerned with. How's your patient's leg? Carved all to hell, but still on her body. Oh,we're watching it overnight. What's going on? Never in my career have I questioned a fellow surgeon in their O.R. I never understood what the problem was-- an intern dating an attending-- until today. fair hours! Fair wages!.... And don't believe 2519 when she tells you that she went to the bathroom. She just wants to go home. She just says she went to the bathroom, and then she's back here two days later. -Got it. -Hey,I need sutures in 2602. Can't help you. What? Fair hours! Fair wages! Fair hours! Fair... it's no offense. None taken. How's the strike going? Do you know-- do you realize how rarely doctors say "thank you" and "please" to nurses? How few surgeons even know the names of... I shouldn't be seen talking to you. excuse me. I'm looking for richard webber. Can I help you? My name is alice bickham. I'm here about my mother grace. Sure. Um... come with me,please. You said you would look after her. I'm sorry. You told me to go to work,and you said you would look after her. Ms. Woods,um,can you-- just follow me. She's a kid,you know? She's scared enough without you putting ideas in her head. How do you tell a scared kid to give her baby away? I didn't tell her. I didn't advise her. I didn't pressure her. I just... talked to her. You're not a shrink. You're not her mother.She's my kid, and you crossed the line. -I'm sorry. -No,you're not sorry. You're superior. So what,you're a big-shot doctor, and you get to judge us? You get to tell my kid how to live her life? Cheyenne is smart. She's smart and she's thoughtful, and she can have more. She can have more than a trailer park and a graveyard shift at a truck stop diner. Don't you want that for her? I mean,if you can get past the fact that I'm superior and that I'm judging you and that I'm telling you what's best for your family-- if you can just get past all of that-- isn't it possible that I'm also right? pretty spectacular recovery, claire. Really? Do you think it's gonna be okay? I think we got almost all of the necrotic tissue. A few times in a hyperbaric chamber, and I'm thinkin' you'll be out of the woods. Thank you for saving my leg. My pleasure. Now dr. Karev here will explain the hyperbaric chamber.Dr. Karev? Thank you,dr. Heron.the hyperbaric chamber... I'll take that apology anytime. ...Which helps kill all the bacteria. This process is done over a couple of days. So I'm going to give her a sedative, which will ease her discomfort. And then I'll remove the tube. Okay. are you ready? Yes. Wait. Good-bye,mommy. do you want to-- oh,no. No,we've already said our good-byes. We just wanted to be here when grace crossed over. I'm ready. I can take care of this. I did it. I-I should undo it. How long? I mean,before... it can take awhile. She wants me to apologize. -You crossed a line. -I'm not apologizing. You made me cross a line. Oh,like I can make you do anything? That's not your fault. It's mine. I'm your teacher. I'm supposed to be. But you came to me as your boyfriend, and I responded that way. I'm not used to being wrong. I know. But you're an intern. Second-guessing a resident is not your job. How long has it been? 2 hours and 17 minutes. I saw you there. At the nursing home, with my mother. Oh. They said you go two or three times a week. Whenever I can. Why did you keep it a secret? I don't know. Would you like me to stop going? I'm gonna go check on grace. Do you think she's lonely-- my mother? Yeah,I do. may she rest in peace. Time of death... 12:42. I don'T... I can'T... I don'T... I can'T... I don'T... I don't want my mother to die alone. Slow... slow down. Slow down. Shh. Slow,deep breaths. That's it. Slow,deep breaths. Breathe into this. Breathe slow. Slow down. It's okay. I'm okay. You're okay. Thank you. You're welcome. do you ever wish you hadn't done it? No. I really don'T. If I give her up, if I give her away, do I still get to name her? You can name her for yourself. Did you name yours? Sarah. That's a pretty name. Yeah. I think you should keep visiting her. You're sure? Yeah. She lights up when you're around. She's alive. Oh,she's with alex. I can't do this in front of alex. Well,you can and you will. E-excuse me? Why aren't you apologizing? I-I'm an attending. I don't apologize to residents. You,on the other hand, are an intern. Sydney,I just wanted to... uh... just wanted to,um... apologize... for,you know,overstepping. I'm--I'm sorry. Well,that's the compassion I was looking for. Apology accepted. Okay,you want to hug it out? Oh. Go. Hug. -Oh,yeah. -Come on. we need them,patricia. Yes,we need them. So... where do I find the spare change? It's not like whatever's hiding underneath the couch cushions is gonna do it. Well,I seem to remember pushing through paperwork for a multimillion dollar surgery robot. There was a 2-year waiting list for that. It will bring in huge business. And could you and the robot handle that business without nurses? We can't help ourselves. We see a line... we want to cross it. Maybe it's the thrill of trading the familiar for the unfamiliar, a sort of personal dare. Congratulations. Only problem is, once you've crossed, it's almost impossible to go back. are you okay? Yeah. You know,I am. You okay? Yeah. What happened today? -Nothing. -Nothing. Okay. We don't know everything about each other,george. Yeah. True. But... if you do manage to make it back across that line... you find safety in numbers. anybody want to have sex? george!
