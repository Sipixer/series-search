Seven days a week, 14 hours a day. We're together more than we're apart. Aah! George's room is bigger than mine. [Sighing] [Thudding] Augh! After a while... - I should have the bigger room. ...the ways of residency... - I got here first. - Meredith should decide. ...become the ways of life. [George] My room is two inches bigger. - Number one... - [lzzie] You have a bigger closet. - Why is everything a competition? - Always keep score. Number two: Do whatever you can to outsmart the other guy. Everywhere else is filled with Meredith's mom's boxes. Meredith? When is your mom coming back to town, anyway? [George] Maybe we can put her boxes in storage. [Lzzie] Unpack a few things, make this place more homey. Some throw pillows, lamps, a few paintings. [George] Paintings would be nice. You have this amazing stuff packed away. I found this box with tapes of your mother performing amazing medical procedures. We should watch them. Do you want to watch...? Meredith, do you want some privacy? [Sighing] Number three: Don't make friends with the enemy. - Morning, Dr. Bailey. - Shut up. You realize that I'm an attending, and you're only a resident. - That you work for me? - I know I've forgotten something. Something is happening today. I know I should know what it is, but I just can't... - Nice talking with you, Dr. Bailey. - It's in front of my face. - [Gasps] Doctor! - Whoo-hoo! [Horns honking] Whoo! Augh! Now I remember. [Horns honking] [Bailey] Watch out. Watch out. Ooh! Whoa! Fools on bikes, killing themselves. Natural selection is what it is. So, what's up with the Nazi? Is she off her meds? You never heard of the race? [Richard] Excellent board, well-timed, balanced, efficient. If all goes well, we'll have an early night. Chief, Dead Baby Bike Race started 20 minutes ago. All right, people! Dead Baby Bike Race day! - Every year, this bar... - The Dead Baby bar. Every year, they hold this underground bike race. You wonder why someone would name a bar something so disgusting? Keep your panties on, Nancy Drew. - The race is completely illegal and... - Crazy. Bike messengers racing against traffic, trying to beat each other for free shots of tequila. No-holds-barred competition, sounds like fun. The race doesn't even have any rules, except eye-gouging. No eye-gouging. We'll be trapped in the pit Band-Aiding idiots when we could be up in the OR. What kind of people engage in a race that has, as its only rule, that you can't rip out the eyeballs of another human being? Men, Georgie. Men. [Bailey] I need someone to get up to the OR floor. The chief needs a right hand. [Meredith] Oh, and yeah, number four... [sighing] George. [All sigh] Everything, everything, is a competition. OK, people. The rules of trauma. Don't mingle with interns. They don't know their ass from esophagus. Sew fast, discharge faster. Get bodies up to the OR. And don't let me catch you fighting over patients. Got it? Come on, let's go. Oh, it's like candy, but with blood, which is so much better! - Oh, my God. - Mine. No! I saw him first! [Meredith] Whoever said winning wasn't everything... Ooh. I'll take that guy. You'll have to beat me to him first. ...never held a scalpel. [Psapp: Nobody Knows] Heads, he's mine. Tails, he's yours. Why do you get to be "heads"? I have a head, and honey, you are a tail. Excuse me. How do you manage to make everything dirty? Ha! Tails. There are plenty of other cases. So, go get one. I was here first. I am not backing down so I can do sutures all day while you're in the OR. This is a surgical case, and you know it. It's superficial. It's cool, but it's superficial. You know those things didn't rupture his peritoneum? Because he's sitting up and he's talking to us. Hello. Excuse me, I was wondering if you could take these out and sew me up, so I could go and win my race. - We can't just pull them out... - [grunts] - We have to do some tests - Ow, wicked. [Meredith] Are you out of your mind? It's a superficial wound. Sew him up and let him finish his race. Hey, good man. [Cristina] John Doe, mid-30s pedestrian, hit by a motorist swerving to avoid a bike. GCS 3. Pupils fixed and dilated. Atropine given for a pulse in the 40s. BP 183 over 112. Pulse-ox 98 percent. Chest showed widened mediastinum and head CT revealed cerebral edema. He's gotten 70 of mannitol, dexamethasone 10 - and a gram of phenytoin. - Give him to the OR? - Is he gorked? - Looks like. [Burke] The bike race claims its first victim. I'll make my AAA repair after all. Uh, Dr. Shepherd? He's not going to the OR? No. Do an EEG and confirmatory tests. If he doesn't respond in six hours, declare him. - Declare him? Declare him what? - Brain-dead. [Sighs] Sir, Dr. Bailey sent me. Should I scrub in? No. I'm stuck here all day. I need you on the floor, - monitoring pre and post-op patients. - Oh. - You got a problem with that, O'Malley? - Oh, uh, no, sir. A buddy of mine in 4451, Lloyd Mackie. Give him whatever he needs. Yes, sir. [O'Malley] Mr. Mackie... No smoking! - There's no smoking. - Why not? Oh, my God... You're in a hospital! Your point being...? I don't know if you've listened to the surgeon general lately, say, in the past 20 years, but smoking is bad. Smoking will kill you. Liver cancer will kill me. Smoking will just speed up the process. You're at the top of the donor list for a new liver. There's hope. Sweetheart, I've been at the top of the list for... ...eight months. I'm not in a batter's cage. I'm in a dugout, about to be traded. - You like baseball? - No. Oh. Um, well, um, the chief wanted me to look in on you. Hmm. Richard's a dear old friend. He's been my doctor for 30 years. Well, whatever you need, I'm your man. Just name it. Well... I'm sure I'll think of something. - [Machine beeping] - Absent corneal reflexes. It's been 55 minutes. If he doesn't respond to tests in the next five hours, what? We stand here and watch him die? [Cristina] If he doesn't respond to tests, it's because he's already dead. [Scoffing] Technically. Legally. - Actually, lzzie. Actually dead. - He's breathing. He has a heartbeat. Look at his EEG. There's no higher-brain function. He'll never talk, move or think again. There's no one in there. Think like a doctor, lzzie. He could wake up. What about a miracle? [Lzzie] There are medical miracles, you know. I know. You're right, miracles happen. [Derek] People do wake up. That's why we do a series of tests over a number of hours. So when we call time of death, we know that we've done everything to make sure it's actually his time of death. That there isn't gonna be any miracles. This is the hard part. To stand around as surgeons and not cut. That's what "do no harm" means. I wish he'd just go into the light already so I can get on another case. Oh, I'm the devil because I'd rather be in surgery instead of standing watch over the death squad? It's depressing. Look at his sneakers. They're brand-new. And somebody sewed this tear in his shirt. And he has one of those electronic key cards. He belongs to someone. An hour ago, he was out there, alive. To simply stand here and wait for him to die... - It would be a waste of life. - Exactly. It'd be a waste of organs. Ahh. You've got a nice touch. [Sighs] And, by the way, you are a rockin' babe. Seriously, do you actually think you have a shot here? I'd like to think I've got a shot anywhere. - Hmm. - Hmm. Look, you really have to let me take you for some tests. You could have internal bleeding. No, thank you, I've got a race to get back to. Why? You can't win now, anyway. Doesn't mean I can't cross that finish line. There's a party at the finish line. Do you want to meet me there? One test. A CT. I'll have you out of here in an hour. I can't do it. Got to go. [Groaning] Well, you realize you're leaving against medical advice, and that I strongly urge you to stay. The frat guy said I could go. The frat guy is an ass. OK, well, you have to sign an AMA form. Darling, I will do anything you want me to. What is it with you guys and your need to dirty everything up? I don't know. Maybe it's just testosterone, eh? Maybe. You might want to see a doctor about that too. Come here. [Grunting] [Sighing] That was for good luck. Don't worry, darling, you'll see me again. For your sake, I hope not. [Door closing] [Sighing] What do you want? You make out with patients now? What, are you jealous? I don't get jealous. - We had sex, once. - And we kissed in an elevator. And we kissed in an elevator, once. - No, seriously. Go out with me. - No. You know, I almost died today. Yeah, I came, like, this close. How would you feel if I died and you didn't get a chance to go out with me? - Get over yourself, already. - Come on. - It's the chase, isn't it? - What? The thrill of the chase. I've been wondering to myself, "Why are you so hell-bent on getting me to go out with you?" You know you're my boss, you know it's against the rules, you know I keep saying no. It's the chase. Well, it's fun, isn't it? You see? This is a game to you. But not to me. Because, unlike you, I still have something to prove. [Bailey] I know you see me resecting this bowel. Do I strike you as someone who enjoys multitasking? We have a John Doe. In three hours, we have to declare him. - We want to harvest his organs. - Why are you wasting time? You know how many patients we have downstairs. If he dies, and he could still live, his death should mean something. And you want a harvest surgery. - I want to save lives. - [Bailey scoffs] OK, I want a harvest surgery. Getting organs from a John Doe is a long shot. Without ID, you can't contact the family. Without the family, you can't get consent. Let the poor man die in peace. What if we can find the family? - [Bailey] And get consent. - We could harvest the organs? If you find the family. What are you doing? Hiding. There's this VIP patient... He likes me. That's good, right? He "likes me," likes me. Go for it, man. Get yours. I'm down with the rainbow. Oh. Are you not gay? - No. - Really? Dude, sorry. Uh, Cristina? Do you...? Do you think...? Does Meredith think I'm gay? Are you? - No. - Really? [Lzzie] Hey, I found this on our John Doe. It's a hotel key card. The police are going to send someone over, figure out what hotel he was staying at, get his ID from there. - I'll make sure the police get it. - It's really important. We only have a few hours before we have to declare him, and I'd really like to find his family. You want their permission for organ donation? I just... really want to find them. You have a potential donor? What's his blood type? Uh, O-neg. [Breathing apparatus hissing] [Monitor beeping] OK. I know you probably can't hear me, and you're feeling this big push to go towards the light, where everything's all halos and all-you-can-eat buffets and stuff. And, I mean, sharing your organs is really great and all. But I think you have a family. I can feel it. So I think it'd be really great if you could do me a favor, and... get better. Just... ...live. So, you think you can give that a shot for me? [Monitor beeping rapidly] [Monitor beeping rapidly] Oh, no. Meredith! - Meredith. He's crashing. - What? What are you doing? Call a code! I can't, I'm not supposed to. He's brain-dead. If he's brain-dead, you have to let him go. No. It's only been five hours and 33 minutes. He's supposed to get six hours. We can't do anything. It's not our place to make that call. He's a person. We're doctors. We should have every right to make that call. We can't just stand here and do nothing while he dies. He has a right to the next 27 minutes. Screw it. I'll get the dopamine. You get the blood. We'll transfuse him. [George] Do you feel any pain here? No. You know, you really do have... ...beautiful eyelashes. Um... Thank you. Uh, what about here? No. And nice eyes. Kind. I like a man with kind eyes. Really? You think I have kind eyes? Mmm. I mean, uh... You can, um... What are you examining me for? Oh, you know, just routine medical stuff. You're doing very well. Because I'm enjoying the view. OK. Well... I gotta go. - He's stable. - For now. I had a radiologist look at his chest. He has a traumatic aortic injury. - He's gonna rupture and bleed out. - He needs surgery. - If he's gonna remain an organ donor. - If he's gonna live. - Izzie... - No, I'm not giving up on him. He has surgery, he lives. That's the point. I'm going to find the family. You get him into surgery. She's vice president of Fantasyland. So who do we go to for the surgery. Bailey? We need to go higher than Bailey. Dr. Burke. - Hello! - OK. [Sighing] Dr. Burke, um, I know you're busy, but our John Doe needs an aortic repair. The guy from this morning? Isn't he legally dead? Well, yeah... He's kinda still around. We gave him two units PRVCs and put him on pressors. On whose orders? [Meredith] Mine. You get a brain-dead John Doe a blood transfusion without consulting anyone. And now you want me to repair his heart? Well, yes. You do enjoy crossing the line, don't you? He is an excellent candidate for organ donation. I am a surgeon. I save lives. This guy is already dead. Now, this is the men's room. Either whip one out, or close the door. - You're asking my advice? - Yes. Now who's chasing? - Not funny. This is important. - OK. You want to get around Burke? You gotta find a way to get the chief involved. What'd I do? How close a match for the liver is your guy to our John Doe? Very. Same type, same size. Couldn't find a better match. Why? He's the chief's VIP, right? Right. How much would you kill to be in on the transplant surgery? You underestimate me. I'm not a baby. I'm your colleague. You don't have to manipulate me. If you want something, all you have to do is ask. We want you to go over Burke's head, to the chief. Ask me something easier. Sir. - O'Malley. How's Mackie? - Fine. Actually, that's what I want to talk to you about. I kinda think that... Me and the other interns... We think... O'Malley, I'm not getting any younger. We found Mackie a liver. [Meredith] We are so going to hell. - Burke is sending us to hell. - On an express train. If it works. What are you doing? [All] Nothing. Yes! [Laughing] Oh, crap. Dr. Burke! Dr. Burke! [Monitor beeping] [Alex] Excellent work, sir. Excellent. Flawless. It's a shame he's brain-dead. If he wasn't, he would be on his feet in a few days. I'm amazed at what's going on. I seriously hate that guy. Alex is vermin. That surgery is ours. [Lzzie] At least Burke is doing the surgery. I don't care about Alex. George, you did good. I'm gonna have to dodge Burke for the rest of my career. He could kill me and make it look like an accident. [Door opening] The police called. They've identified your John Doe. His wife is on the way. [All sigh] [Monitor beeping] Oh, my God. [exhales] Kevin! - [Derek] It's OK. - [Woman] Oh, my God! Mrs. Davidson, this is Dr. Stevens. Now, if you have any questions at all, please call me. Is there...? Is there still a chance? We can hold off till morning, but if there's still no change, we'd... We'd like to talk to you about organ donation. [Monitor continues beeping] [Richard] Mackie? Mmm. How are we treating ya? Oh, fine. Except that beautiful boy won't let me smoke. [Mackie] You should reprimand him. Make him change bedpans. [Laughing] Mackie. That beautiful boy may have found you a liver. [Sobs] [Tegan and Sara: I Won't Be Left] [Pager beeping] God, I smell good! You know what it is? It's the smell of open-heart surgery. [Sniffing] It's awesome. It is awesome. You gotta smell me. I don't want to smell you. Oh, yes you do. You have got to be kidding me! OK, I have more important things to deal with than you. I have roommates, boy problems and family problems. Wanna act like a frat-boy bitch? That's fine. You wanna take credit for your saves, and everybody else's? That's fine too. - Just stay outta my face. - [Door opening] And for the record, you smell like crap! [Sighing] She attacked me. Meredith! Meredith! Meredith! Meredith! You might want to leave before I change my mind, and let her beat you to a pulp with her tiny, ineffectual fists. [Sighing] What? Nothing. It's just... Nothing. Oh! This one is skin grafting! Skin grafting? No way! I've never seen that done. Are those my mother's surgical tapes? We should watch the skin grafting one first. Where did all this stuff come from? Oh. I unpacked some of your mother's things. I was upset. And when I'm upset, I like to nest. Oh... Hemipelvectomy! I think we should watch this one first. No. We're not watching my mother's surgery tapes. We're not unpacking boxes. We're not having conversations where we celebrate the moments of our lives. And use a coaster! - I ordered Chinese food. - [Meredith] I hate Chinese food! [Door slamming] They're everywhere. All the time. Izzie's perky, and George does this thing where he's helpful and considerate. They share food, and they say things, and they move things and they breathe. - Ugh. They're, like, happy. - Kick them out. I can't. They just moved in. I asked them to move in. So you're gonna repress everything in a deep, dark, twisted place until, one day, you snap and kill them? Yep. This is why we are friends. Why is the Nazi making us stay in the pit two days in a row? - [Meredith] Leftovers. - Leftovers. Gotta get the cyclists who were too drunk, stupid or scared to get to a hospital yesterday. She gets to do a freakin' organ harvest. - Kills you, doesn't it? - What? Two women caught the harvest. No, it kills me that anybody got the harvest but me. Boobs do not factor into this equation. Unless, uh, you want to show me yours. - I'm gonna become a lesbian. - [Cristina] Me too. [Elevator bell dings] [Cristina] Now, Mrs. Davidson, this form simply says you consent to the donation of your husband's major organs. Heart, lungs, liver and kidneys. [Sighing] Now, I need to ask you a few questions. Are you willing to donate his corneas? You want his eyes? Um, corneal transplants can give someone back their sight. I suppose that's OK. [Sighing] What about his skin? What? [clears throat] It's used to help burn victims. You want to cut off his skin? What about the funeral? You want me to have a funeral and have people look at him... Have his daughter look at her father and he doesn't have any skin? It's his skin! [Sobbing] What are you doing? - I'm not a people person. - No kidding. I can't do that. I can't talk to the families of patients. I'm sorry. - What's his name? - Who? The patient. What's his name? - Kevin Davidson. - Remember that. Not "gorked guy." Not "John Doe." Kevin Davidson. He's someone's husband, someone's son, not a collection of body parts for you to harvest. A person. Now, no one said this was easy. I owe you, George. No, you don't owe me anything. I'm just happy we found a liver. Well, when I get out of here, how about I take you and my new liver out for a night on the town? What do you say? Uh, Mr. Mackie, no offense or anything. You're very handsome, but, I, um, I'm not... I mean, you're not my type because... You're a man, and... [chuckling] George, I never thought you were gay. - You didn't? - Oh, child, please. You? Gay? I'm sick, George, not blind. But then, why have...? Because dying is a "get out of jail free" card. I can be as bold as I want, and there's nothing anybody can say about it. So I flirt. Haven't you been attracted to someone you know you couldn't have? Well... I'm... No. What's her name? There's no... I'm not... [laughing] You know... This is really... ...not... Meredith. Hmm. Meredith. [Inhaling] To be young and in love. Let's go get that liver, shall we? No, I'm sorry, I... I didn't... [sighing] I never liked harvesting. Why? Like I said, I'm a surgeon. I save lives. This ends one. I know you tried, so no hard feelings, OK. - I was just... - You were saying goodbye. What's Viper doing here? Probably crashed his bike. Again. How long has he been waiting? I don't know. I've been busy on real cases. He's all yours. Viper. Viper? Are you OK? [Coughing] Viper! - [Meredith] Oh! - [Gasping] Call the OR, tell them we're coming, and page Dr. Bailey. Alex, let's go. Alex, push the damn gurney! - [Nurse] Clear the way. Coming through. - Somebody get the elevator. I don't know how long I can keep this wound closed. Move faster. Damn it! [Elevator bell dings] This a new one? Somebody get her off my patient. Meredith, get cleaned up and scrub in. Alex, back downstairs. Yeah, but I helped. They tell me down in the pit, you only wanna take the hot cases. Every pack of interns, there's always one fool running around trying to show off. And, Alex, this time that fool is you. Get out. Get me something to stand on. Lower this table. The mountain is gonna have to come to me. Count backwards from ten for me. Richard. You're a good friend. The best. Shut up and count backwards already, Mack. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... [beeping] I'm not gonna stay. It's your job. You have to. You're better at this part than me. I don't wanna watch him get taken apart. Look at the vultures... waiting to pick him clean. Every last one of them represents someone somewhere who's gonna live because of Kevin. [Cristina] Here. Put it on. I'll be waiting next door when you're ready. Everyone's waiting. OK, doctors, let's get this over with. [Reindeer Section: You Are My Joy] [Monitor beeping] [Flatlining] [Door opening] Lzzie? I'm gonna sew him up, for his family. You do it. - What? - You do it. Mrs. Davidson. He's ready, if you'd like to see him. [Sighs] [Laughing] [Bailey] This lovely group's his friends. Uh, you all belong to... What's his name? - Viper. - V... Viper. [Man] Yeah, we were in the race. How is he? Is he OK? Is he OK? No. No, he's not OK at all. He hurled his body down a concrete mountain at full speed for no good reason. [Scoffing] Yeah, I know you all pierce yourselves, smoke up and generally treat your bodies like your grungy asses can't break down. That's fine. You want to kill yourselves flying down a concrete mountain, go to it. But there are other people walking, people driving, people trying to live their lives on that concrete mountain. One of them got his brains scrambled 'cause one of you little sniveling no-good snot rags... - Dr. Bailey. - Yeah, so. OK, no. Your friend, Viper, as far as I'm concerned, is not OK. [Man exhaling] She's, um... ...really tired. [Meredith] But... ...Viper's gonna make it. He's gonna live. - [Man 1] Cool. Thanks. - [Man 2] Thanks. [Lisa Loeb: Fools Like Me] It's not the chase. - What? - You and me. It is not the thrill of the chase. It's not a game. [Sighing] It's... It's your tiny, ineffectual fists. And your hair. - My hair? - It smells good. And you're very, very bossy. Keeps me in line. I'm still not going out with you. You say that now. - [Monitor beeping] - How'd it go? Very smoothly. Damn. That means I'm gonna have to quit smoking. Ah, the pretty ones always come crawling back. [Meredith] There's another way to survive this competition. A way no one ever seems to tell you about. One you have to learn for yourself. Number five: It's not about the race. At all. There are no winners or losers. Victories are counted by the number of lives saved. [Cristina] Oh, OK. This is the best part. Watch. She pulls the flap of skin down over the face. - We were... - Hi. We were... we were just, uh... Cristina made us. [Meredith] And, once in a while, if you're smart, the life you save could be your own. What are we watching? Ooh. This is the one where my mother... - Literally pulls this guy's face off.
