How's Shane, my partner? I just didn't want her to see. I thought she might take offense. - Can you get my wife? - Baby? - You're gonna drill into my skull? - You're kidding me, - the navigational system is dead? - Damn it, Stan. Stan. Can I watch the surgery? Can I... - Can you sneak me in? - You're busted. I'm going to tell him. I don't want him seeing other people. What? Nothing. I'm... gonna be late. We need to talk. My wife gets panicky if she doesn't know what's going on. - I will keep her updated. - You seeing anyone? At the end of the day, the experience of practicing medicine</i> bears little resemblance to the dream.</i> Are you... Are you really okay? Yeah. Alex, come on. That was intense... Intense and crazy and just awful. How can you be okay after a day like that? We go into medicine because we want to save lives.</i> You did a good job today, and it was not easy. What you did was not easy. It was brave. We go into medicine because we want to do good.</i> We go into medicine for the rush, for the high,</i> for the ride. But what we remember at the end of most days</i> are the losses. What we lie awake at night replaying</i> is the pain we caused... The ills we couldn't cure... I don't want you to date other people. It may not be enough for you, but I'm trying here. I don't want you to date anybody but me. The lives we ruined... or failed to save. At the end of the day, the reality</i> is nothing like we hope. The reality is, at the end of the day, more often than not,</i> turned inside out and upside down.</i> Over here! Meredith, get in there. We don't have time to lose. I got the shirt open. I'm almost there. Stop! Stop! Stop! Just hold still! Okay, that's it. I got it. It stopped. I got it. Holy crap. My artery blew. - Your artery blew. - I didn't think it would really happen. I thought it was something that the doctors say might happen because they have to, I didn't think that it would really happen. Me neither. Their local tech's in Spokane. That's 5 hours away. Did you tell 'em I was in the middle of somebody's brain? Yes. The tech is still in Spokane. You can't just pull the probes out and go to a full craniotomy? No. Why not? Uh, the probe is in the tumors. Pulling out without the navigation system could damage the brain tissue. You can't leave the probe in very long without risking swelling. - That's good. What's your name? - Two. Steve. Steve Mostow. Dr. Steve Mostow, intern. Steve, I need you to run to the nurses' station. Tell them to make an announcement. We need computer technicians in OR 3. Go fast and scrub in on your way back. - Yes, sir. - Dr. Shepherd. - Yes. - I did three semesters in computer science before I switched to nursing. I don't know what's wrong, but if it's something reasonably basic, I... I'd feel a lot better about this if your voice wasn't shaking. My voice shakes when I'm nervous. I'm an imperfect person, but it doesn't mean I can't fix the computer. Rose has three semesters of computer science at... - What school d'you go to? - Santa Cruz. - That's a party school. - You want to insult my education, or do you want me to try and save your patient? Who can beat three semesters of computer science at Santa Cruz? Anybody? Okay, give it a shot. I appreciate the vote of confidence. Can you see anything yet? Uh, I see the diaphragm moving. Move it up a little more. - Meredith. - I'm working on it. You're not doing a very good job. I am doing a damn fine job. Don't you worry. Can you... - Can you close his eyes? - What? Stan... Can you... Can you close his eyes? I'm sorry... so sorry. Meredith, uh, stop. Stop right there. I want to freeze that frame. Yeah, his pericardium's full of blood. That's not good. That's not good at all. Oxygen, IV start kits. Arnie, monitor. You, pericardiocentesis kit. His anatomy's all screwed up from hanging upside down. Get someone from cardio. Go. I got Tucker waiting for me in the lobby, and I'm already late. Do me a favor and take the patient through the post-op. What? Okay, I wanted to say that when you took me off of Hahn's service today... There's something wrong with him. His blood pressure's bottomed out. - Dr. Bailey? - O'Malley... Okay, I need you to talk to Tucker. I need you to ask him to wait. He's not going to be inclined to wait, so I need you to ask him nicely. Can you please go and ask him nicely to wait? - Yes, ma'am. - I won't be long. You see this, Stevens? Sternum's cleaned out, which means we're almost outta here. You don't want to stay and watch me work? You know, it's offensive, Dr. Sloan, flat-out. I asked you if you wanted to watch me work. - How's that offensive? - And now you play dumb? Does that work for you because of the way you look? - What the hell are you talking about? - I'm saying, if you were homely, you would've lost your job a long time ago. Dr. Hahn, the chief needs you in the ambulance bay. We have a paramedic with cardiac tamponade. All righty, then. Let's go, Stevens. Nick, can, uh... - Can you reach your call button? - I think so. No, no. Don't move that much. Just... Can... Can you reach your phone... - without moving very much? - I think so. I think so. - I got it. - Okay, good, good. Okay, dial... Dial 8. Okay. Okay. Is that... Is that 8? Put it to my ear, okay? Hello, nurses' station. Hi, uh, this is Dr. Grey. Um, yeah. Mr. Hanscomb's carotid just blew. Uh, can you page Dr. Sloan for me, please? And also Dr. Yang? And... I'm gonna go ahead and call this a code blue. Yes, code blue. Can you announce that, please? - <i>Right away.</i> - Thank you. - You can put it down. - Code blue. That means I'm dead, right? That's what they call when people go, like, flatline? I figure we can use all the help we can get. I don't care who it is. I don't care who it is, Jolene, I am leaving this hospital when I am finished here. I don't care if the patient is on fire. I'm not scrubbing in anywhere else. It's Dr. Yang's. Lexie Grey is paging you 9-1-1. Dr. Yang, your intern called a code blue on a patient who apparently is not code blue. - What do you mean? - Why would she call a code if... Go find out. I thought you needed me here. You said you needed me here, - that's why you pulled me off cardio. - No, I'm fine. Go kick some intern butt. How you doing, Dr. Grey? Lexie. I'm okay. You okay? Well, I'm a little freaked out if I'm being honest. Mostly 'cause you look like Carrie at the prom. Seriously, you're wearing, like, half my blood. Which is why we're hanging some more right now. - I'm having trouble getting a vein. - Why? He's hypovolemic. His veins are flaccid. That's not a nice thing to say. That... That's not a nice thing to say at all. - Oh, son of a bitch! - Okay! Grey, stop that bleeding. - Stop the bleeding. - I... My hand slipped. - I got it. - That can't happen anymore. That can't happen anymore, okay? Just apply steady, firm pressure. I called for Sloan. Should we just take him to an OR? No, there's no OR. I was just down there. Tyler, you should run and get some more blood. - Just in case, OK? - Keep applying pressure. - I'm gonna go get Sloan. - You're leaving? I'll be right back. You can do this. You're doing this. Are you seeing this, Karev? How I'm tightening the cable by hand? Yeah. That's my face. - What? - Up there in the gallery, I built that face. That's Jane Doe. The one with amnesia. - Is she a surgeon? - I don't, uh... You are... You are so busted. Dr. Sloan, it's Nick Hanscomb. His carotid blew. Karev, I need you to irrigate thoroughly finish up and pack the wound. - You're leaving? - Can survive without me. - My other guy can't. - There's no OR available. This one will be. I need you to get this room turned around ASAP. I'm bringing down my carotid bleed. Tucker. She's busy, right? She can't make lunch? She can. She can make lunch. Just a slightly later lunch. - She's in surgery. - Always is. - It's taking a little longer than... - Always does. She's having a really bad day. She's saving the life of a white supremacist. This is not a good day. So she asked me to ask you if you wouldn't mind just waiting just a little while longer. Please. She did say please, which, as you may know, is not a word she uses that frequently, so... She really is sorry. This shouldn't be much longer. Fine. But tell Miranda I said don't keep me waiting long. Please. Lucy. If it's all right with you, I'd like to update Mr. Nolston's family and meet you in the ambulance bay. He's your patient. Don't you want me to keep the family informed? I want you to think like a surgeon. You're thinking like a social worker, and if you want to be a social worker, you can save yourself a lot of effort, because the training is 2 years, not 12. But if you want to be a surgeon, you can update the family when the crisis has passed. You're right. Absolutely. I'm sorry. I... - Yes, sir? - Did you bring anybody with you? Uh, no. The nurses made an announcement, and I waited, but no one came. Damn. Damn it, damn it, damn it. I don't have the steadiest hand. I need to reconnect some wires, when you talk to me, it is less steady. - So it's about the wires? - I think so. I'm pretty sure. - All right. I'll do it. - What? I'll do it. You said yourself you don't have steady hands. - Because I'm nervous. - Yeah, I got that. Let me take care of the wires. I'm a neurosurgeon, I have steady hands. You're holding the leads in the patient's brain. Okay. Steve, - How's your hand? Is it steady? - Uh, yes, sir. Good. It better be or you'll kill my patient. - Hold this very, very still. - Yes, sir. Very very still. Good. Sterile sleeves, gloves, plea. Tell me what I've got to do. You talked to Tucker? Yes. He says as long as you're out soon, he'll wait. Oh, mother of... The hepatic vein was injured. - Can you check for a new murmur? - Yeah, checking now. O'Malley, I need you to go talk to Tucker. - Just ask him to wait a little longer. - But I just scrubbed in. - O'Malley, ask him. - Yes, ma'am. A person can only rise so high. Now I'm rising above, but there's a ceiling, and I'm about to hit it. Let me guess. Air embolus? We're about to start the pericardiocentesis. But with the position of his body, the blood won't be pooled to the base of the heart, so... I'd still use the subxiphoid rather than the parasternal. Right. Okay. - Did you hear that? - Yeah. Is the kit ready yet? Yeah, I'm getting it ready for you now. How you doing, Ray? Grey, you've got to be careful with this technique. If you aim the needle incorrectly, you could nick - the very-thin-walled right atrium. - Which could cause a cardiac rupture. A cardiac rupture, a tension pneumothorax... Basically there's about 6 different ways she could kill him. Are they talking about me? No, don't listen to them, Ray. Shut up. Sir, you're gonna be fine. Stevens, go get me an 18 gauge needle before this man's heart explodes in his chest. Got it. How you're doing, Karev? Yeah, good, I'm fine. My nose itches. It itches like crazy. Yeah, that's the anxiety. You know you can't scratch it, so it itches. - What did you do? - Nothing. I was irrigating. I need more suction. Let's get some exposure. It's coming from inside his chest. I think his heart's starting to bleed. Hang a unit of blood. - Page Hahn and Sloan, now! - Right away! Tyler, could you get me more gauze, please? Why do you need more gauze? Because I'm bleeding? I'm still bleeding? Well, we have blood going in, too, Nick. Is it going in as fast as it's going out? I'm asking because I'm starting to feel, like, queasy... And... weak, maybe like a... A person who's losing a lot of blood. Okay, I'm transferring now, Nick. You ready? Should I be calling people? Should I be calling my family or somebody? I think... I think the bleeding stopped. How you doing, Nick? Oh, Dr. Sloan. It's Dr. Sloan. - I think the bleeding stopped. - You okay? Do I... do I look okay? Actually, you do. Dr. Grey, looks like you got the bleeding under control. - Why would it stop? - It could have been the herald bleed, which means, there's a possibility of it bleeding again. But it won't, 'cause I'm gonna get it closed up before it does. - There's no OR. - There will be in ten minutes. Dr. Grey, get a pressure dressing on this wound. Dr. Yang, get him prepped for transfer, and straight to OR 3. I'm gonna make sure it's cleared out. You did good work. Thank you. I'm in love with you now. I've forgotten entirely about my ex. Come on. Are you kidding me? - What? - I have a patient on the table who's... - I gotta go. - Erica... Stevens, page the cardio fellow, then book an OR. Have it waiting when they get him free. - Why am I not surprised? - Dr. Bailey is very sorry. She's very, very sorry. - I'm outta here. - She just asked me to ask you if you could wait just a little while longer. She's almost done with the surgery. It took... It's more complicated than she expected, but she is almost done. Fine, I'll wait. But you tell her I am tired, tired of her choosing everything over me and our marriage. You tell her this is the last time. I'm finished. You tell her the only reason I'm staying here is to tell her that myself. What the hell did you do, Karev? Nothing. Uh, I cut the cable. The bleeding... You cut the cable? You were showing off for your girlfriend? Do you have any idea how screwed you are? Not his fault. One heart graft's blew. Holding his left coronary with a clamp. - Somebody paged Hahn? - I'm here. - What happened? - His heart graft blew. - Damn it. - If you need... All I need you to do, Karev, is to stay quiet and get more suction in here. Just hold on to that. Your husband is waiting. Good. He's waiting and... I heard you. Why aren't you scrubbed in? I could use a hand. He said something about you choosing... Everything over your marriage. He said that? What else did he say? I think that was about it. You think or you know? He said that this was the last time and that he was finished. I'm in surgery, O'Malley. Did you tell him that I'm trying to save a man's life here? That I want to be there with him right now, but if I were to leave, he would die, did you tell him that? Yeah, yes. You need to go back out there and tell him that I took a vow... A vow to save lives. And he might want to remember that he also took a vow... For better or for worse. You tell him that it's his job as a husband to understand that. You tell him that I'm standing by my vow, for better or for worse. You tell him I'm holding him to his vow. You tell him if he's thinking about leaving right now, that he might find himself hurt and wounded and needing an operation, and he may not get a surgeon who is as married to her vows as I am. You tell him that. - Can't I just do some charts? - Go. - It's in. - It's in? Wire's in. Steve, are you still? Yes, sir. Very still. Stop looking at me like I killed your patient. I am not a computer technician. I did my best. I gave it a shot. - Didn't do your best. - I did my best. It was my best, damn it. Calm down. Take a deep breath and think. What did you miss? What are you forgetting? You forgot the restart button? I forgot to press the restart button. It's working. It's working. It's working. It's working. Santa Cruz is not just a party school. - Dr. Shepherd... - Yes. Sleeves. This was never my plan, to... To die this way. - You're not dying, Nick. - You're going to the OR. No, I know. That's what I'm saying. I mean, I think we kind of have some say, or at least a feeling. But I never had that feeling, so... I can't die, right? I don't feel good. I feel... - Nick, can you squeeze my hand? - My God. What happened? The blood to the right side of his brain... He had a stroke. Looks like he had a stroke. Let's go. Let's move him carefully. Let's go. You can't cry, Lexie. This isn't over. You can't cry. You need to find the xiphoid process. Can you feel it? - Got it. - Okay. Now go two finger breadths to the left of the xiphoid. I'm there. Here. 18 gauge. That is a very big needle. - I know. I'm sorry. - You're going to angle the needle toward the left shoulder. Don't stab. You don't wanna hit the ventricle, and you don't wanna drop the lung. - That wouldn't help matters either. - I changed my mind. - I want out. - This is gonna help you, Ray. I'm gonna go on three, okay? One... - two... - Wait. Tell Stan's wife I'm sorry. Tell Sara I'm sorry about Stan. Tell her yourself. - One, two... - Wait. Wait. We're running out of time. Just wait a minute. - What's taking so long? - He's not ready. I'm trying not to be scared. I don't wanna die scared. I wanna not be scared. Ray, listen to me. It's good to be scared. It means you still have something to lose. Are you scared? All the time. That's good. Okay. I'm ready. But... don't count. Just do it. Just do it so I don't know it's... The infection went to his heart. His hack of a surgeon didn't check the grafts. I should've caught it. I should've checked. I missed it. Damn it. How did I miss it? Stupid. Stupid. - That's fascinating, Dr. Hahn. - What? You're as unkind to yourself as you are to everyone else. Dr. Sloan, his artery blew again, and he appears to be having a left-sided CVA. - Where is he? - Here. You told me to bring him here. Hahn, are you close? Get him to a sterile procedure room. - Run! - Let's go. - I'm done. What do you want me to do? - I need an anesthesiologist, - a nurse, I need equipment. - I'm on it. Karev, stay with Hahn. This man has four children. He has four children. - I feel like I'm going in too far. - Pull back, pull back. - Pull back, pull back. - Chief, what am I doing? You're too far in. There's some ST elevation. Try angling more forward. I got it. I got it. That feels good. I can breathe. Okay, he's almost stable. Get ready to cut him out. All right. We're gonna get you outta here. We're getting you outta here right now. You're bleeding. - That's Ray's blood. - Let me see that. You could use a couple of stitches. Now you stayed calm and focused and efficient in a very stressful situation. That's impressive. I was scared. You did it anyway. Like I said... Impressive. Do not tell me that there isn't an OR available. This is for the Chief of surgery. There's a paramedic's life on the line. - You need to find one now. - I'll see where we are. Dr. Stevens. Thank God. How is he? I believe he's still in surgery, but I don't know. You don't know? Why... don't you... You said you were gonna keep me informed and... I know. I'm sorry. I'm on another case. But I was gonna check back... You're on another case? I'm sorry. I have four kids here. I have four terrified children who think that their dad's gonna die any minute. You had lousy instructors who didn't teach you how to be a good doctor, or really bad parents who didn't teach you how to be a decent human being? Stevens, OR two is clearing out now. Thank you. My husband is Jacob Nolston, and he went into surgery hours ago. Could you please find someone who can tell me whether he is dead or alive? She said that? If you could wait a few minutes, you guys could talk to each other because, you know, things get lost in translation, because this is clearly not a way to have what is obviously a very, very important conversation. It is clearly not very important. Our marriage is falling apart, and she sends you to save it. Tucker... She's in surgery. She's saving a life. She's literally saving a life, - she's gonna be here soon. - She's always saving a person's life. She'll always be here soon. You go ask her, when exactly is "soon" gonna come? Excuse me. You're... You're the one who came to get me, who told me about Stan? Is Ray... He's in surgery. I have to go. I have to get... I have to get outta here, so... Look, can you tell him that... That I'm sorry that I... That I can't stay here? But I can't come back here right now. Ray wanted me to tell you that he's sorry, too. He's sorry he couldn't save Stan. He wanted me to tell you that in case he didn't make it. You think he's not gonna make it? I hope he makes it. But you won't be here, so... My husband is dead. He's dead... Somewhere in this hospital. How am I supposed to... To stay here? I don't know. I don't know. But I know that if Ray... makes it, he's gonna wake up, and... he's gonna have no one. And you're gonna go home, and you're gonna have... no one. I think it's better to have someone. Even if it hurts, even if it's the most painful thing you have to do, even if it's the most painful thing you've ever had to do, I think it's better to have someone. See this skin, O'Malley? It looks a little... jagged. Does it look jagged to you? 'Cause if it is jagged, I'm going to have to reposition the incision so that it approximates more correctly. If I do that, this man's swastika tattoo might be unrecognizable. Yeah, it's a little jagged. I thought so, too. He left, right? Yes, he left. 10-blade. More lap pads, Stevens. Pack them all around the heart. Suction. Come on, Ray. Fight. You will not die. You will not die. You will not die... Don't do this, Mary. Come on. Don't do this. I need more light. Can I get more light? Come on. Come on. - He's coding. - Come on. Live. Please live. Please. Please live. He looks bad. He looks really bad. Well, his heart was severely damaged and his lungs were compromised. But he's young and strong, and our hope is that he'll be just fine. I'm here. Well, your liver had more damage than we saw on the CT, and then we found a perforation in your bowel. But we took care of it all, and you should have a full recovery. Not a full recovery. Dr. Bai... She did this on purpose, right? I don't understand. You have a black partner, right? Mary? Do you know how she is? Are you two friends? Look, I'm not the devil, okay? I'm just a guy with a belief system. Mary's a nice girl. We save lives together. That's a good time. Now if she wanted to marry my brother, I'd have a problem with that, but so would a lot of people. I'm not that much different than most of the people that you know. Well, Dr. Bailey did save your life today. A black woman saved your life at great personal cost. So maybe next time you're looking at your tattoo, you're thinking how much better all us white guys are than everyone else, you think about that. Because between you and me, if I had been alone in that OR, you'd probably be dead right now. And since we're sharing belief systems, I believe, if you were dead, the world would be a better place. How's he doing? He's okay. The surgery was pretty hairy. He blew a graft when we were closing. But he's starting to rally. Good. That's good. What are you doing here? - I was just checking... - We did just fine without your help. You mind? You're not heading home? Just easier at this point to stay here till Tucker's asleep. You know, I rose above, too, today. - Yes, you did. - You were having a hard day, you were busy rising above, but so was I, which is why I haven't said anything. But now the day is over, and I'm done. - Excuse me? - You know, what you did, pulling me off of Hahn's surgery, was an abuse of power. - What are you... - You know, you need help? Okay. But you used me because of the color of my skin. I mean, you compromised the quality of my education because of my color. I resent it. You saved her life. No, I fixed her brain, restored her motor skills, did a highly stressful, extremely difficult procedure. But, no... You saved her life. Thanks. That was... Your voice is shaking. I'm an imperfect person. Are his parents coming? They're on a plane from California. You gonna wait? Yeah, I'm gonna wait. I don't want you to date other people. It may not be enough for you, but I'm trying here. So I don't want you to date anybody but me. That's it. Except... I'm scared as hell to want you. But here I am, wanting you anyway. And fear means I have something to lose, right? And I don't want to lose you. Don't. Don't say anything. I'm gonna leave, and you can say something tomorrow. That's progress, right? Are you... Are you really okay? Alex, come on. That was intense... Intense and crazy and just awful. How can you be okay after a day like that? Why won't you talk to me? What do you want me to talk about, Rebecca? How a guy almost bled out while I watched, or how I got suspended for a week 'cause you were there? - It's Ava, not Rebecca. - Right. You're playing dress up. You're here playing dress up. You have a husband, Rebecca. You have a baby, and I have a life. That girl you were talking to earlier when you were playing med student? I'm screwing her. She might be a bigger wreck than I am, but at least she's not married, at least she's not gonna get me suspended, at least she's not trying to pretend to be somebody she's not. You gotta ask yourself what you're doing here. 'cause I think if you could get honest, if you could just tell the damn truth for one minute, I think you have to admit you're not here to talk. You did a good job today, and it was not easy. What you did was not easy. It was brave. We killed him. The hospital... Sloan... Us... We were not prepared. That happens sometimes. That's... Do you have any idea how backwards that is? We help more than we hurt. I have no one. This is gonna sound bizarre. I realize at this point that this is gonna sound bizarre, but... Any chance you people want to get a drink with me? Why would we want to do that? She's saying she needs a friend. Okay. Fine. Let's drink. - You won't hit on me? - I can't promise that. - If I say please? - He still can't promise that. Fine. I brought supplies. Some days, the whole world seems upside down.</i> She's got no one. I'm drinking. Are you drinking, Lexie? A drink would be good. I was Hahn's right hand today. That's good, right? That's great. I think a patient feels better if they know their kids aren't terrified. They're more likely to pull through surgery if they know their wives aren't panicked. - I think those things matter. - Well, they do matter. I'm never gonna be Cristina. It's just not gonna happen. And I am never gonna be Erica Hahn. I am not... kick-ass. Thank God for that. I love you. I love you. We're not gonna make this work, are we? Marriage is hard. I mean, even when it's right... It's hard... and... Next time I do it, I just want it to be forever. And I don't... I don't think it's our chemistry. I think it's our timing. But I don't think it's our chemistry. So we're saying maybe someday? We're saying maybe someday. Come on, Izzie. Dance party. You want to dance? I will if you want me to. And then somehow, improbably and when you least expect it,
