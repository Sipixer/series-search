you had on a black dress strappy sandalsand a slit up the side. i've had this thing for my roommate since, like, day one. she's pretty great,you know? who's thatch? my dad. thatcher. she never talks about him. i'm glad you moved in. oh, so she moved in with you. didn't she tell you? and what i know now is that when i go into my bedroom, i'm gonna see that my wife is cheating on me with mark who happened to be my best friend. after careful consideration and many sleepless nights (here's what i've decided) there's no such thing as a grown-up. we move on. we move out we move away from our families and form our own oh, no hello? no. dr. burke. yes. yes, i'll let her know. that was your landlord. he wants you to know that there's a minor flood in your apartment. your other apartment. but the basic insecurities the basic fears and all those old wounds just grow up with us i'm exhausted. me, too. and just when we think that life and circumstance (have forced us to truly) once and for all become an adult... i was going at it all night in the on call room. what's your excuse? your mother says something like that mom. i tell you, that man makes me purr like a kitten. mom. when he isn't making me growl like a tiger. stop. and my husband wonders why i'm not interested in him anymore. or worse,something like that if he had any balls at all, he would leave on his own. no. he plays stupid. he's waiting for me to kick him out. i come home with a hickey on my shoulder a hickey, for god's sake like i'm some sex-crazed teenager, which, let's face it,these days, i am, and what does thatcher do? pretends he doesn't see it. we get bigger we get taller we get older but... for the most part we're still a bunch of kids running around the playground trying desperately to fit in you know, he's acting like i committed a crime, like my apartment is full of stolen goods. he's acting like i kept my apartment to hide stolen goods so i could do illegal transplants for money. are you sure he's not just acting like you lied about moving in? okay,what's wrong with you? my mommy's a filthy whore. you have dirty in your eyes. you have dirty in your eyes. i'm not doing dirty with you anymore. it was a one-time lapse in judgment. well, it was a 4-time lapse in judgment. well, it's not gonna happen again. oh. okay. i'm serious. we're friends,and it didn't work when we tried to be more than that. so... as fun as it was, it's not gonna happen again. stop looking at me. i'm not looking at you, i'm rounding. i'm rounding, too. -fine. -fine. chuck eaton, 54, has stage 3b non-small cell lung cancer with possible invasion of the pleura and a history of c.o.p.d. he's had extensive chemo-radiotherapy with minimal regression of the tumor. he's been admitted for radical en bloc resection. i was a smoker. the, uh, oncologist... he explained that i have a 25% chance of surviving the, uh, surgery. well, unfortunately,that's about right. if you should elect not to proceed, we can make you more comfortable. with all due respect, uh... there's no way that you can make a man dying a slow death comfortable. i'll roll the dice. how do i look today? would you say, you know, i look nice? you could usea little more lip gloss, but, yes, you're very pretty. aw, you're mean. i'm just kidding. you look fine. seriously, how's my breath? george. would you just talk to her? who? what? good morning, dr. bailey. hello, baby. are the o.r.'s up and running? uh, yeah,they're fully functional. uh, except there's some smoke damage to the corridors. how about you? you fully functional? i'm fine. how's your husband? taking him home tomorrow. yes, we are. yes. yes... okay,this is not a tea party. go. work. save some lives. now! do it now. jake burton, 15, has advanced craniodiaphyseal dysplasia. was admitted last night after complaining of headaches. and he's not a complainer. he's been havingsome nausea as well. really, okay? may i, please? jake, can i get you to sit up, please? sure. all right, okay. now i want you to look right here for me. thank you. you know, if you pretend i'm a lion, it helps. sorry? if you pretend i'm a lion instead of a really messed up kid, you get a talking circus animal, which is way easier to look at. dr. yang, what's our immediate concern? uh, that the bony tumors are growing inward and encroaching on his brain. "invasive non-small cell with a history of c.o.p.d."? guy's pretty much a goner, huh? sensitivity...i like that in a stranger. are you new here? visiting. confounded by all the rain, and it's only my first day in town. you get used to it. makes me want to stay in bed all day. we just met, and already you're talking about bed. not very subtle. subtle's never been my strong suit. so... do you ever go out with co-workers?: i, um, make it a rule not to. then i am so glad that i don't work here. are you hitting on me in a hospital? would that be wrong? meredith. ow. ah. what the hell was that? that was mark. punching out people on my surgical floor? my head of neurosurgery punching out people on my surgical floor? put the ice back on your hand, derek. my hand is fine. put the damn ice on your $2-million-a-year hand. now... would someone tell me what the hell happened? that was mark. who's mark? he and derek used to work together back in new york. and, uh... they were...we were all close friends until... derek found us in bed together. you put your weight behind it? yes, sir. well, all right, then. what the hell is he doing here? i have no idea. derek and i always did have the same taste in women. excuse me? you're derek's lusty intern, right? i heard about you all the way back in new york. you're famous. well... i heard about you all the way here in seattle, so i guess we have a lot in common. we're the dirty mistresses. i suppose we are. my $400-an-hour shrink says that it's because behind this rugged and confident exterior i'm self-destructive and self-loathing to an almost pathological degree. hey, we do have a lot in common. you know, it's funny. der... derek walks in on me naked with his wife actually in the throes and he just turns around and walks away. but he sees me so much as talking to you and i'm on the ground bleeding. interesting, don't you think? what do you think you're doing? you need stitches. i know. hold the mirror. why is he suturing his own face? to turn me on. because he's mark sloan. he's like the go-to plastic surgeon on the east coast. that's the guy addison was sleeping with? well, you can't really blame her, can you? no, not really. yes, you can. mcsexy wants an x-ray to check for fractures, and i think it's a bad idea if i take him. why? why? i'm on it. why is it a bad idea? mcsexy? no? mm. mcyummy. -no -no. mcsteamy. ah, there it is. yep. oh, excuse me, i'm just chokin' back some mcvomit. ooh. i saw her first. the night she met shepherd, i had her ear. we talked, and i can't even remember what i said. you know when you haven't had sex for awhile, you sort of forget how good it is and don't really need it much? yeah, that doesn't happen to guys. it's like a beas... a beast that was asleep for a long,long time. and now the beast is wide awake and wants to be fed, and the food that alex gave it was... it was good food, george. something needs to be done about your taste. ah! you're just jealous because you're beast is still asleep. eh, my beast isn't asleep. my beast never sleeps. mr. eaton. do you need a hand with that?

i'm fulfilling a patient's dying wish by sending hate mail to everyone he's ever met. yeah, right now i understand the impulse. me, too. why do people cheat? that's a good question. why do you think she cheated on you? were you different then? were you a bad husband? i was, uh... oh, i was just a little...absent. not that that's an excuse for her. do you think things would've been different if you'd had kids? do i think she wouldn't have cheated? i don't know. all right, man, jake's ready to roll. i'm sorry. did i interrupt something? no. it's fine. pamela, you should really try and relax. i am trying to relax. the episodes happen when i don't relax. do you really think you can fix this? i, uh, i hate to be insensitive, but... would it be the worst thing ever if we can't? i mean... you know, i like sex as much as the next girl, like in bed or even in private. but when you can't go to the movies or drive a car or go to church with your parents... oh, my god. you know that dream where you show up at high school and you're naked?
