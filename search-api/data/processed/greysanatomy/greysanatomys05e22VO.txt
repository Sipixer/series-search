are going to be big ones...</i> They're never as big as you make them out to be</i> in your head. It's... the regular days... The ones that... Start out normal... Those are the days that end up being the biggest. And today was the wedding. It was beautiful... Perfect. Just a normal day. A normal day. We're going to work. Just a normal day that ends in a ceremony in a churchy church. This has nothing to do with us. We're just the bride and groom. - We're getting married tonight. - We're getting married tonight. - You slept here? - I'm awake. - What? - You slept here? I slept here. How? Wait, who, what? I slept in the on-call room. I could've been at home in my own bed. - Sorry. - Now I have to work all day, and then I have to be happy maid of honor and get Meredith down the aisle. - I'm so tired... - Because I slept here, because you wanted to get your freak on with roller skate girl. I am sorry. I was gonna, but... we went to dinner and... things didn't... I wasn't in the mood. I had to be here early anyway to run the E.R., so... You're picking up extra shifts in the E.R.? So is, Owen not here today? He's here. Crap. I'm late. Big day Biggest day of your life. Don't do that. Don't do the peppy maid of honor thing. It's creepy. Really? Good. Wait, is this, like, the calm before the storm? Do you need me to drug you or shave off your eyebrows - to numb you into submission? - No, I'm fine. It's not the biggest day of my life. It's the biggest day of Izzie's life. I'm excited about the marriage, not some wedding. Anyway, she's the one who's gone all bridezilla. Bridezilla. You should see the bridesmaids' dresses. And the flowers... They're being delivered at 5:00. I had to pay extra for them to decorate the church, but Derek gave me his credit card, told me to do what I had to do, so... it's gonna be perfect. - How's her blood pressure? - Within normal limits. And her incision site? As expected two weeks after surgery. Well, she just got off the I.L. -2 38 hours ago. - She could still have... - Her mets are gone her blood pressure's fine, her incision doesn't hurt. She's doing well. It's wedding day, and I am going to the wedding. I'm a bridesmaid. I'm going. - Right, Bailey? - I said you could go. Wedding day! Up top, Alex. I'll check on you later. Come on. Don't leave me hanging, Bailey. - Wedding day. - Wedding day. You just did that 'cause I have cancer. - You didn't mean it. - True. My hair is starting to fall out. You still look good. I know what this means, you being here. - I'm sorry. - I'm still going to the wedding. S05E22 <i>What A Difference A Day Makes</i> - How's Izzie? - Good. Is her B.P. stable? If she's hypotensive, she really shouldn't go to the wedding. - You let me worry about Izzie. - All right. Do you have anything for us? Anything good? Nope, it's slow. You don't say it's a slow day in the pit. You never say it's slow. You just jinxed us. - It's a day and it's slow. - When that phone starts ringing with traumas, you're gonna wish you hadn't said that. The phone's not gonna ring. It's a slow day. Go for Seattle Grace emergency. - I'll get the trauma gowns. - Crap, crap. Incoming! How's it going with your shrink? I'm doing better... Inch by inch. Progress is... slow. It was your ceiling fan, above your bed... the blades spinning like the blades of a chopper. My shrink said that was the trigger to me, Choking you. You know, we should probably get going. David simons, 22. He was in the driver's seat. His car got crushed by a semi. Truck blew a tire and jackknifed across four lanes of traffic. Take him to bay one until we get a trauma room ready. - What are the injuries? - He sustained chest contusions. - Otherwise, vital signs were stable. - We can't be late. Ready? One, two, three. - Late for what? - Graduation. Becca wells, 21-year-old restrained backseat passenger. Vitals stable en route. Some shortness of breath, but good breath sounds.

I've got doctors who need access. What went wrong last night? I'm kinda busy here, Arizona. I have four surgeries back-to-back and a kid on life support, I'm kinda busy too. - What went wrong? - That's not any better. Put him in the hall. We went out to a four-star restaurant, best in Seattle. It was supposed to be fun, romantic, but then you ordered a salad when they make the most delicious french food, and then you picked at it, barely spoke to me, then bolted. So what went wrong? - Did I do something? - I just wasn't feeling it. I was exhausted, tired. Sorry. Hey! I said the hall. The hall. Fill me in, O'Malley. I put in the first chest tube, but there was no blood. Tried another one, but there's no pulse. - How long has he been down? - 20 minutes. - Should I open his chest? - He's gone - Move on. - He's supposed to graduate. - move on. Let it go - To see him graduate. He is gone. You can't save him. You move on to save the people you can. We have more trauma coming in. Now. Move. Call it, Grey. Time of death... 9:24. {\pub}It could be anything. It could be scar tissue, okay? - We just wait and see. - It's a tumor. You don't know that. {\pos(192,210)}Denny Duquette is standing right behind you. {\pos(192,210)}It's a tumor. {\pos(192,210)}Right, Denny? {\pos(192,210)}It's good to see you, dr. Bailey. You can't see him because you don't have a tumor, but he says hi. Tell Denny Duquette I said go home. It's a tumor. Wait and see. I'm sorry. I'm crying more than usual. You said I'm in shock. Is that it? It's also the morphine. I should've slept with David. I thought about it, but he was... sweet and and funny and... I would've fallen in love with him. And I didn't want a relationship till after school. I... I don't like to do things... halfway. I was doing school, and then I was gonna do life. And now... Now David's dead. David's dead. How was the C.T., Karev? Her stomach is herniating into her left hemithorax from a huge lac in her diaphragm. We're taking you to surgery soon. I should've... I should've had sex with David when I had the chance. Dana... Is she okay? The paramedics haven't brought her in yet, but as soon as they do, I'll let you know. Do you have any, family we can contact? They're in Argentina. I'm supposed to fly there tomorrow. It's d-day. It's what? That's what Dana calls it. My parents don't have the money to let me stay. I have to go back. We both knew d-day was coming. I tried to break up with her to make it easier. I'd switch classes every semester so that we didn't have any together. But it didn't matter. I couldn't stay away. When you love someone, you know, love is love. It doesn't matter that you're not supposed to be together. How's he doing? He's starting to stabilize. Good. Looks like he's ready for C.T. I think... Maybe she got out in time. Maybe she's not hurt that bad. Because when I turned around... She wasn't there. She was not there anymore. X-ray is really backed up, but... - That's Pete. - What? David's friend... Pete. The... - The red sneakers. - Could you get over here and help me? He's bleeding through the dressing on the chest wound. Pulse is 220. Pericardial effusion. Get me a syringe and a spinal needle. I'm going in through the wound. I'm gonna need another syringe, now. - There's too much blood. - Just keep the syringes coming. Give me a 60cc this time. - Asystole. He's flatlining. - Get the cardio board. - There. - Just... Keep holding pressure. I'm starting compressions on my count. One, two, three. Just keeping putting pressure. I am not losing another one. Thank you. You're scrubbing in? I thought I was doing this solo. You are Then why aren't you sitting in a corner reading a magazine? This is a big day, Meredith. I'm just taking precautions, that's all. Afraid I'm gonna kill the patient on my wedding day? It's a routine colectomy. I'm not gonna kill him. I know. You're gonna do great. - Pretend I'm not even here. - Okay. Okay, boki... scalpel. Great. Very nice. What? The way you asked for the scalpel. You didn't mumble. You took charge right off the bat. Loud and clear "scalpel." It was good. Very impressive. Great. - I'm gonna get started now, so... - Of course. You won't even know I'm here. Thanks. Maybe I'll toast to the fact that they found each other. It doesn't bring up the future. It does not talk about whether they'll make it. It's good, right? You said you were tired, exhausted, but you can't be that exhausted if you are working in the E.R. on your day off I rallied. You rallied? You're lying. No, I'm not lying. I love the E.R. Can you hold, please? Thanks. You love the E.R.? Can't get enough of it. It's fun. You should tell her. Suck it, Mark. We need more blood in trauma two. Go. - What? - I just lost another one. All my patients are dying. I need you to pull me. That's for me to decide. There's an ambulance coming in. Go see what you can do. - I'm in over my head. - Walk away O'Malley. That's Michelle. She dyed her hair for graduation. Look. I'm looking, but I don't see anything. Because there's nothing there. - The scan's clean. - I told you. Then why is Denny back? The man's a hallucination. That means there has to be something there. Look, Izzie, if it's clear, then... I want to go to this wedding. I want to watch the bride walk down the aisle. I want to hear the vows. I want to catch the bouquet. I planned this wedding down to the very last detail. It's the perfect wedding. This wedding... is perfect. You know how much I want to be there. So why would I tell you about Denny, today of all days? Why wouldn't I just wait? Denny is back. That means something is there. It's not like we can just... Map the brain for hallucinations the way we do a seizure. Wait a minute. What are hallucinations? Hallucinations are neurons firing in the brain. Exactly. Why? It's never been done before, but if we can somehow induce your hallucination, there's a chance that we could pick it up on an E.E.G. Then we could pinpoint the part of the brain that's hallucinating. Trauma one's open. - What do we have? - She had a pulse in the field, but we haven't been able to get one now for over 30 minutes. I'm pretty sure we left half her blood volume on the side of the road. She's D.O.A., man. I just need you to call it. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Crap. A pink sweater. That's Jordan's girlfriend. Move her out of here. - I need you to call it. - Time of death... Time of death... 10:45. - He's coding. - Get a crash cart. {\pub}We are closed to trauma. Because we have trauma coming out of our butts. {\pos(192,210)}You have a nice day, too. {\pos(192,210)}So the E.R. is fun, but I'm not? {\pos(192,210)}You can get enough of me? {\pos(192,210)}Is that what you're saying? Do you just want to just end this? Because there are women that are lining up for me. I'm hot, and if you want out, then you should just have the guts to say so. I can take it. Maybe this was just a fling that's run its course, okay? - Maybe it's over. - Maybe it is. I got some adhesions. I need to dissect down to mobilize the sigmoid. Bovie, please. Do you have something you'd like to say? You're doing fine. How's the solo surgery coming along, Grey? I think it's going okay, but you should probably ask the Chief here. She's doing great. She chose a cautery when, at one point, I probably would've gone with scissors, but she made it work. We'll be out of here in plenty of time for the wedding. Good. Then she won't have any excuses. Excuse me? This is the second time I've been Derek's best man. I have to come up with a toast, offer some words of wisdom... it's a lot of work. I don't want to have to be his best man a third time if you know what I mean. So you came in here to threaten me? I'm his best man. That's my job. What now? It's okay. It's fine. Everything... everything's fine, right? I don't need to say anything. So... now what? I just try to have a hallucination? Is it always Denny? I mean, no one else? - What? - Oh, no, nothing. It makes sense. It's the man you love. He's not the man I love. He's not? I love Denny. I will always love Denny. He means a lot to me. I... But I think I hallucinate Denny because I associate him with death and dying. When I think about my future, who I am now, who I want to be, how I want to spend the rest of my life, when you get that flutter in your chest Alex is the man I love. Karev. I love Alex Karev. So... let's find this tumor and get it out of me so that we can have our perfect wedding... a wedding not wasted on two people who don't appreciate weddings. - I can hear you. - I know you can hear me. I mean for you to hear me. - What if I can't make him appear? - We'll wait until he appears. You have to be at the church in two hours. - It could take more than two hours. - I'll be late. No being late. I'll make him appear. I can do this. Come on, denny. How are my friends doing? Just tell me. I can take it. I mean, I can't, but I can. Did someone else die? Why don't you tell me your speech? - Your graduation speech. - I can take it. Becca, just... Just give me your speech. You worked hard on it. You should do it right now. Come on. Today is the day my life begins. Today... I become a citizen of the world. Today I become a grown-up. Today I become accountable to someone other than myself and my parents...</i> accountable for more than my grades. Today I become accountable to the world...</i> to the future... to all the possibilities that life has to offer.</i> Starting today... Come on, denny. Come on. My job is to show up... wide-eyed... and willing</i> and ready. For what? I don't know. For anything... for everything... Damn it. Charge to 360. To take on life... Nice job, Meredith. To take on love... all the times I didn't ask for you, and you were here. Now I'm asking. Please. Please come to me now. Please help me now. Come on. Come on, denny. Just... You come to me now. To take on... the responsibility and possibility. Today, my friends, are lives begin. Time of death... 13:02. And I, for one... There. Can't wait. I'm here for you, Izzie. It's right there. {\pub}These the results of the tesla 7 M.R.I.? You know that part of the brain that reacted during the hallucination? It was the other temporal lobe. That... That's the tumor? Tiny. Too small to pick up on a normal M.R.I. But... okay, if it's that small, how are you gonna get to it? I wish there was something I could do for her. I wish I could... I like Stevens. She's one of the good ones. I wish there was something I could do for her. I... I know something you can do. I just want you to know that I'm hurt. I am hurt and I am angry, because I thought that we had something. I thought that we were going somewhere. If you're just sleeping around, if you're just making the rounds of girl surgeons, then I think that you ought to know that I We went to a fancy restaurant. - What? - We went to a fancy restaurant, The nicest restaurant in Seattle. The salad that I ordered... the salad cost $26.95. The wine that you ordered cost $125 a bottle I didn't even look at the entrees because I knew I wasn't gonna be able to order one because I was already out 75 bucks, and I don't even like salad. And then the bill came, and you... I paid. Do you know what I was doing before they brought over the check? I was counting in my head trying to figure out how I was gonna buy food for the rest of the week if my half was 75 bucks... because I don't have 75 bucks because my father disowned me and has cleared out my bank account. I am broke. And I am exhausted, Arizona. I'm working in the E.R. because I need the money. Six people died on my watch today, and I am fried. I wanted to stay in last night. I thought... I thought that last night would be the night for us, you know, our night. But you wanted to go to a fancy restaurant, I can't do that. - I can't. - It's okay. It's okay. Hey. So... we stay in. And we'll eat... Sandwiches. You don't even like sandwiches. But I like the girl who has the sandwiches. Okay? Okay. No, you know what? I don't like sandwiches either. I like pizza. I like pizza, too. Yes, sir. I've been reading your mother's journals. I wish she was here today. I don't know how she would've felt about me getting married. No, not for that. For this... Your first solo surgery. She probably would've said, with all the mistakes I've made, - I'm lucky the patient's alive. - That's right. But I also know that she would've been thrilled. She wouldn't have been able to tell you, but she would've been. Thank you, sir. You... best wedding present ever. And you know why? Because now I have to go home and put on a corset and pantyhose and a petticoat and look like one of those idiots on top of a wedding cake, and then I have to walk down the aisle and have everyone staring at me. But it's okay, because I got to cut someone open today from start to finish. I saved a life. What? What do you say we make this day even better? - Good work today, O'Malley. - Good work? They're dead. All those kids are dead. - Not all of them. - The one I didn't touch is just fine. Because I was able to get to her. And the reason I was... the only reason... is because I had you on my team. You saved that girl today as much as I did. Trauma's a team sport, O'Malley. You don't have to be the hero. You just... you just have to go where you're needed. Bailey says Shepherd found another tumor in Izzie's brain. Did you hear? I heard. He doesn't think he's gonna get it out this time. I think... I think she's gonna die on me. I think she's really gonna die. What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be getting ready for a wedding? That's what I came to talk to you about. Hi. I'm dr. Grey. I'm gonna take care of your central line. You're crying. You're breathing. My shoes are, in the closet there. Shoes, right. You're supposed to be helping me... get ready. I can still go, right? I mean, the tumor's not going anywhere, so... - Yeah, you can go. - Okay, well... We don't want to be late. Here she comes. You're supposed to be at the church. I'm going. I just came to say, this isn't my dress. Of course it's your dress. It's perfect. - What are you talking about? - No, this dress is not for me. - I don't... - What? Oh, God. I knew you were gonna freak out before the wedding. Derek loves you. Marriage is good. - Tell her it's good. - No, she's saying... It's not her wedding dress. She's right. The dress isn't for Meredith. I don't... I don't even know how to... I... Thank you. Okay. So who's the maid of honor, me or Cristina? Cristina. Alex... he needs a best man, and he was asking for you, so... So what, I'm leftovers? You tried to save my life. That makes you honorable. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the wedding of Alexander Michael Karev and Isobel Catherine Stevens. This is a sacred rite, an ancient rite. As isobel and Alex prepare to join their lives, it is important to understand that everyone present has played a part in shaping their lives and will continue to play a vital role in their continuing future. And thus, we are here not only to witness their vows to each other, but to bestow upon them our blessing. And now the couple will read their vows. - We didn't write anything. - No, wait. I have something I want to say. Today's the day my life begins. All my life, I've been just me... just a smart-mouth kid. Today I become a man. Today I become a husband. Today I become accountable to someone other than myself. Today I become accountable to you, to our future, to all the possibilities that our marriage has to offer. Together, no matter what happens, I'll be ready... For anything... For everything... To take on life, to take on love, to take on possibility and responsibility. Today, Izzie Stevens, our life together begins. And I, for one, can't wait. I love you. - Not yet. - Hurry up. By the power vested in me by God and the state of Washington, I now pronounce you husband and wife. - Now? - Now. You never know the biggest day of your life is the biggest day...</i> not until it's happening. It's okay. It's just hair. You don't need it. It's just gonna keep falling out. We'll shave it off. I bet you look good bald anyway. Okay? Stop. You're beautiful. You don't recognize the biggest day of your life,</i> not until you're right in the middle of it. The day you commit to something or...</i> someone... the day you get your heart broken... Best non-wedding day ever. Want to go again? The day you meet your soul mate... the day you realize... There's not enough time... Because you want to live forever... Those are the biggest days... The perfect days... you know? I bet you made a beautiful bride. It was a beautiful day. You put the scarf on. I told you, you don't need it. You look gorgeous without it. He's right. Go away now. Go away. I want to be alone... With my husband.
