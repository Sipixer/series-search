- The sex with Izzie... It's like she's trying too hard. - I got fired. - What's the problem - with you and your sister? - She's not my sister. - We have the same dad. - You killed my wife. - You took her from me. - What do you need, scotch, vodka, gin? Just don't tell Meredith. There comes a point in your life when you're officially...</i> An adult. Suddenly you're old enough to vote, drink...</i> and engage in other adult activities.</i> So... Why the brain? Why biology's Crown jewel? You mean why did I go into neurosurgery? Come on. Share. Share with Sydney. It was the headset with the magnifying glasses that tipped the scale for me. And the man has a sense of humor. I like that. Suddenly people expect you to be responsible...</i> Serious, a grown-up. Work stuff. As if you didn't know. I'll just be a sec. I think they're on a date. That's definitely a date, right? Maybe she's dying. Is she dying? Is that why? Oh, come on. Grow up. She's nice. She asked me out. Want me to fake a heart attack? I do a great fake heart attack. - Here she comes. - Carry on. It's Sydney. In the movies, when the handsome but sensitive football player kisses the awkward, freaky girl in front of the whole school... That girl is her. You are very awkward and freaky. We get taller... We get older. But do we ever really grow up? Do you know what kind of batteries these take? - Double "A." - Is it really? Do you have one? I have some in my locker. Yeah. We're avoiding them now. It's come to that. Why are you avoiding Izzie? It's like we're not us anymore. Everything used to be so easy. Talking at least used to be easy. Now, we can't even talk anymore. Oh, Derek went on a date with Sydney Heron last night. It was probably a fake date to make me think he's healthy and moving on. Do you think he's healthy and moving on? - Can we just take the stairs? - Okay. Bailey. I, uh... Just, uh, I wanted to congratulate you. I'm sorry if things got... You deserve the job. Does she ever... Come here, new chief resident. Huh? - Someone deserves a big hug. - Come on, Sydney. Well, I admit, I'm a wee bit jealous. But the chief has made his decision, and I will abide by it. Oh, Callie... - I'm, uh, I'm so sorry. - I'm fine with it. Oh, good. We're being a brave soldier. No, really. I'm fine with it. Let's not spoil this moment for Miranda. Okay? All right, listen up... I have nothing but respect for the job done by Dr. Torres, but things are gonna be different from here on in. Things are totally weird between us. We can't hold a normal conversation. This will be a professional environment. So your love lives, your hopes and dreams, the little joys and tragedies that make you who you are, have no place in my hospital. He's acting like a total stranger, like I don't even know him. The locker room is for changing, not for crying. The on-call room is for napping, not for anything that requires a locked door. Oh, my god. Don't even get me started on the sex. It is just tragic. - It's like... - Stevens, did you hear a word I said? Grow up, I believe, is my point. Dr. Bailey, can you make sure I stay on Dr. Hahn's cardio service? Already done. But if you piss her off or mess up or in any way embarrass me, that's it, no more chances. Thank you. I will be the best resident she's ever had. No, Yang, I will be the best resident she's ever had. Yes, right second to you. His incision is healing nicely. No erythema or purulent discharge. He'll be monitored, we'll try weaning him off the drip once his meds are maximized. After discharge, we expect him to follow up in the cardiac clinic. There are four other people here, Yang. How about letting one of them talk? Mr. Talbot's cardiomyopathy is unusually complicated, that's all. You know, you could take a cue from Dr. Stevens. She knows what's going on with her patients, and she's inclusive. - What do we got? - High school bus crash. Bunch of kids just came in. We got more on the way. Tricia Hale,17, vital signs stable. Sustained a large facial laceration, trauma to the buttock area and an open fracture to the lower right leg. Okay, trauma room two. It's still bleeding. My face is still bleeding. We'll get to that in a minute, OK? We? No, try the head of plastic surgery. No one is touching my face until I've spoken to the head of plastic surgery. No one. 34-year-old passenger Marcus King, no complaints except deep cuts on his left arm. Stable on route. Listen, I'm fine. Please help the kids first. They're being taken care of. What happened? I was taking the kids on a tour of colleges. We're from California. The bus slid down an embankment. One, two, three. Mandi? Mandi! Marcus? - What's your name? - Danny. Hey, Danny, I'm gonna take this off so I can have a look, okay? Man, high school really does suck. It was that asshat sully and his stupid friends! The driver kept turning around, telling them to shut up. I'm just drawing a logo, and suddenly I'm upside-down. The pencil went all the way in his eye. I can see that. - Should I call his parents? - Let us do that. Sully and those jerks should be in jail. You should be calling the police, - not my parents. - You need to not think about those kid. You'll be out of high school soon. You never have to see 'em again. - I still gotta finish. - You need to calm down. When you raise your voice and get upset, your blood pressure shoots up, you could lose your eye. I need you to stay calm. I'll try. Listen, I really can't feel what you're doing. But I hope you're not leaving a big, old' scar. No, no. No, no. Just a few little stitches. I do stitches all the time, so. Do you want me to take over, Dr. Bailey? No, no. I do stitches all the time, O'Malley. I just thought with all the more serious injuries coming in, - you'd want me to take over. - I'm fine here. You're not the boss of me. Actually, I'm the boss of him, if you want to know. I'm the chief resident. - What? - Yeah. Oh, Mandi. You know something? I'm not surprised. Did you know we went to high school together? - Really? - Yeah. And this girl right here, she is a genius. Used to help me with all my homework. Just a few papers. that's all. Dr. Bailey... - I do stitches all the time. - I know, - but you might want to take a listen. - Something wrong with my ticker? Um, part of your heart may be working overtime. So, I, uh... will get his E.K.G. and page Hahn. Will you finish the sutures? You can't finish this? I... Yes. I can do it. Sure. I'll do it. You go get Hahn. Okay. You better be able to fix my face. I have pom statewides in a month. - You're a cheerleader? - I'm a pom. Cheerleaders just jump around. Poms are dancers. I was on the football team. I'm not sure you're gonna be dancing in the next month. You better be lying. Not lying. You have very serious knee and leg fractures, not to mention a cracked coccyx. What the hell is that? That's the bone at the bottom of your spine. - The bottom of your bottom. - My ass? I broke my ass? That's one way to look at it. Don't look at it. You're gonna need surgery. Good news is that we'll put you under so we can fix the bones and Dr. Sloan can fix your face all at the same time. You better be good. Baby, you're not gonna find anybody better than me. Oh, my god. Hot cheerleader ass. Take a cue from Stevens. From Izzie Stevens. Seriously? You need to cut Izzie some slack. Her and George are having problems. Already? It's only been a week. At that point, you don't even talk. All you do is have sex. Doesn't mean you can't have problems. Derek and I are having all kinds of sex, and he's dating other people. - You didn't hear any of this. - Oh, please. Fine. Whatever. You paged me 'cause you couldn't handle a few stitches on a wino? He keeps hollering for Dr. Grey. I wasn't sure if I should get her or call the cops or what... That's not Dr. Grey. Dr. Grey's a girl. I want my daughter! Stay here. Make sure he doesn't leave. - Would you page her? - Karev... Keep Meredith out of it. Get Lexie. - Yes, sir. - <i>G-R-E-Y!</i> I need to talk to you about your dad. You know what? I don't want to talk about my dad. In fact, we're never gonna talk about him again, okay? You helped me out once. Now it's over. I can't believe I gotta fill out all this stuff. I mean, a kid gets a bump on the head and you've practically gotta write a novel? Mandi, I know you're really busy but if there's any chance, any chance you could help me with some of this stuff. Patients are supposed to fill those out. It's not the doctor's job. You be quiet. Uh, don't worry about it, Marcus. We'll figure out something. Good old' Mandi. You always got my back, huh? You hush now. I hate to interrupt the reminiscing, but I am trying to listen here. You do have atrial fibrillation. But you're not symptomic, so that's a good sign. We'll start you on some blood thinners and do an outpatient workup. A treatment plan you could've made yourself, Dr. Bailey, If you weren't acting like such a blithering idiot. Teacher's pet's in trouble. Oh, come on. Hush now, Marcus King. Hey, you paged? - Yeah, your dad's here. - What? He's drunk, he's noisy, and you need to take him off my han. I have a broken ass I have to get back to. Call Lexie. I called Lexie. She's not coming. And the next person I'm gonna call is the cops. Cause the guy's ready to get outta here, and there's no way he can drive. Gosh. It's good to see you. See! That's her. Meredith Grey. |I'm sorry. I really, really am. I'm sure you are. The last time I was here, I said some... Terrible things to you. Telling you not to come to Susan's funeral? It wasn't your fault. I know you did everything you could. What I said to you... I'll regret it till the day I die. And the drinking... is unacceptable, yeah. But today, uh... Today... Is Susan's birthday, and I... Should I go get Lexie? No, just you. I just want you. I never knew what to say to them. In high school. Kids like him. They were always so... separate from the rest of us, you know, alone. It wasn't like that for me. I... I was prom queen and class valedictorian. Yeah, I wouldn't broadcast that. I had a great group of friends. - You know? - Not really. Well, let's see what we got here. - Oh, you see that, Dr. Stevens? - Yeah. Looks like the pencil lifted up one of the branches of the A.C.A. Is that a bleed? It is. It's a little one. We need to get that pencil out before it gets any bigger. I'll book an OR. I am not a blithering idiot. Hahn had no right to speak to me that way, no right at all. But Marcus isn't... He's just not an old friend, is he? He's... He was maybe your boyfriend or... You know, high school sweetheart or... I was his tutor. Okay? He was a track star, didn't have a lot of time for homework, so I helped him with his math and reading... And... French and chemistry. Then he was just a friend? Really? Okay, there was some talk, the possibility of... us going to the homecoming together, but it... It didn't work out, and I was fine with that. Certainly not a blithering idiot... Today. Nor any other day in my life. These and that. Thank you. Is it me, or are there... teenyboppers staring at you? I get that a lot. It started when I was there age, never really went away. Is that so? Go over there, come on. - What can I do for you, ladies? - Tell him. No, it's embarrassing. You can tell me. You look exactly like her dad. Swing and a miss. I'm going crazy with this Hahn thing. Every time I try and impress her, she hates me even more. Not worth getting hung up on. Why, did something happen? Apparently they're not even talking to each other at this point. I know it's wrong, but that makes me feel better. - You're not gonna sit? - I was gonna, but I really need to cram. I got a big surgery today. You know, we're operating on the kid with the pencil, so I'll see you. - Okay, see you around. - Okay. Will she be able to sit on her butt again? Or will she have to carry around those toilet seats for the rest of her life? She'll have full use of her butt in a few weeks. I am so, so honored to be filling in for you as captain. You're filling in for me as captain? I prayed on it, and god seems to think it's the right move. - Okay. - And I don't want you to worry. I called Randy I think I might've convinced him to still take you to homecoming, even though - your face and your butt all messed up. - I bet he'll take you. He's classy that way. Okay, so now that we've established that Randy's a classy guy, visiting time is over. Bye, sweetie. - I hope they don't ruin your face. - Go! Kinda sucks, huh? Little manicured vultures. My life is over. My life is over. Mom. I love you, too. Will... Will you... Will you tell dad.... Hello? Thanks to your piece-of-crap phone, my mom's gonna think I died. - This is where... - Yeah. But we'll keep you updated. You better not end up blind and go to some blind kid's school, 'cause, um... If I have to go back to junior year without you, you're gonna be dead meat. Later, freak. You're the freak. - You are. - You are. I promised his life gets better after high school. He deserves to see that. He's got a good friend. That's something. That girl has bee by his bedside all day. Yeah, but even so, those cliques, they're miserable. He just needs to know it passes eventually. Sorry, Dr. Shepherd. What's so funny? I'm just not sure we've come as far as you'd like to think, clique-wise. We? The hospital. You think the hospital's clique-y? Oh, damn it. The artery's burst. His brain is swelling and cutting off blood supply. Push 80 grams of Mannitol. Okay, let's go. How do I tell his best friend that he's gonna be in a coma for the rest of his life? You can't tell her yet, Derek. The family has to know first. Danny's doctor. Thank God. It's only been a few hours without Danny and I'm already starting to freak out. I mean, look what I have to put up with. They're crying. like, actual real tears. 'Cause they're so worried about Danny, which would be fine if they knew who Danny was. Whatever. Can I see him? He hasn't woken up yet. But he's okay? As soon as I know something, I'll let you know. She'll recover full function of her knee? I hope so, 'cause if she doesn't get back on the pom-pom brigade, her life is totally over. You'd think the way they treat her, she'd be ready to ditch the whole thing, but no. She's not gonna walk away from that. It's her life. It's her identity. It's the only way she understands herself in the world. I heard one of the sweet young things told Mark he looked like her dad today. What does that have to do with anything? You just seem really empathetic to her plight, you know? Loss of identity, shattered self-image. You seem pretty happy about what happened to her. She's just happy 'cause Stevens and O'Malley hit the skids. Didn't I tell you not to tell anybody? I pulled all the x-rays for tomorrow's scheduled surgeries. And what am i supposed to do with them? I thought I could put them in the OR if you needed me to. Well, I don't. Back off. What? - You're being a brownnoser. - I'm helping her. You're annoying her. You got a chance to show her what you can do, you're blowing it. And trust me, these kinds of chances do not come around all the time. So, you know, just back off. I'm sorry I didn't know you when you were in high school. I've regretted it every day, not knowing you. Sometimes I still worry about you. Then other times I think, you know, maybe that's what made you so strong. Not an excuse. Not at all. But you are so strong. Gosh. You're stronger than Lexie. I don't know her that well. True. You're a very impressive person, Meredith. I'm so proud of you. I'm a lifetime... A lifetime's worth of proud. Anyway... How was your date with Sydney? I was wondering when you were gonna bring that up. - My dad's in the ER. - Really? He cut himself. He's not bad company, actually. He's quite funny and charming. Drunk. Is it weird that I like my drunk dad better than my regular dad? A little. Are you okay? Yeah... But my patient's in a coma, and he's never gonna wake up again. His best friend is in the waiting area. The poor thing thinks he's... She thinks he's gonna wake up any second. I don't know. I don't believe it. - Who told you? - Henry. He was observing in Sloan's surgery, and he said that Sloan announced it to the whole OR. - O'Malley and Stevens are done. - Yeah. - They didn't even last a week. - I know. Can I have the key back to my house? - What? - The key to my house, I want it back. I heard we broke up, I want it back. Can I have it? I don't have any idea what you're talking about? Really? Apparently everyone's talking about the fact we broke up. - Who have you been talking to, George? - Nobody. - I talked to Meredith. - See, I knew it. What do you mean, you knew it? You been talking to her? But only after you were talking to her. So, I'm not the only one who talked to her then. You talked to her first. What is my dad doing here? Your dad came in drunk this morning. That's what I was trying to tell you earlier when you blew me off. So you run to Meredith? The one person that I asked you not to tell? I was trying to help, okay? Right. You know, you haven't changed. I mean, not even one bit. You get this very intense look on your face when you're serious, you know? It's your serious, home-work-doin' face. Hasn't changed. Dr. Bailey, is that a patient form I see in your hand? Yes, I suppose it is. Patients are supposed to fill out patient forms. You have work to do, - your own work. - Yes, sir. Mandi? - Mandi? - Mandi, I'm not. - I'm not feeling so... - Marcus? Marcus? - Pulse-ox is dropping. - Pressure is 82 over 48. Tell radiology we need a stat spiral CT and page Dr. Hahn. Marissa. I know Danny's parents aren't gonna be here for a couple more hours, But could I at least see him? Please. All right, come on. Let's go sit down. When I removed the pencil, the artery burst. When the brain swells that much, it has nowhere to go. The hemor... I am getting two cups of coffee. Two. One for me, one for my dad. He's here. What's wrong with you? At this exact moment, in OR two, Dr. Hahn is performing a pulmonary embolectomy. A pulmonary embolectomy, Meredith. So what's the problem? You're on her service. Just go. No, I can't... because that will make me a brownnoser, and everybody hates brownnosers. I cannot be a brownnoser. Okay. So... there'll be other embolectomies. You can let this one slide? No, I can't! I don't know how to just let a pulmonary embolectomy slide. Sure you can. It's just like cutting a class. You never cut a class. Never, not once. That was a pretty big VSD on the echo. I'm gonna have to do an additional arteriotomy of the right PA. You should've taken the situation seriously. You should've ordered further tests. Maybe I should've. Or maybe you should've. And if you weren't so busy flirting with the patient like a love-struck teenager, maybe you would have. Forceps, please. This is so sad. I used to walk by his house every day. He was in my algebra class, I think. Marissa... I know that this seems impossible right now, but you will get through this. Danny would've wanted you to... You don't know what he would've wanted. You're just like them. You're a prom queen, and you're trying to act like you know what it's like for me. You have no idea what it's like. I wasn't a prom queen. I was the girl in the cheap clothes from the trailer park who got pregnant and got thrown in the pregnant girls' class. None of the mothers would let their kids hang out with me. But I got through it. You will get through this. I'm gonna write a letter to his mom and dad. That's really beautiful. - Get out. - What? Get out. You're not supposed to be in here. - She's here. - She's his friend, his best friend. Go away. Go. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... It's okay. You just lost your best friend. It's the worst thing in the world. I'm sorry... about Danny metcalf. It looked like it was hard on you, which is good. If I had a son going through that, I'd want the surgeon to be... fully invested like you were. You have no idea who I am, do you? Of course I do. Bye, Dr. Shepherd. You're the nurse in OR two? The one that talked about cliques? Yeah. Right? I am never gonna be captain again. You know, I was fired from a job recently. You were fired from being a doctor, and they let you cut open my ass? Shut your trap for 8 seconds and let me finish. I didn't get fired from being a doctor. I got fired from... being, like... our own version of squad captain, which is mostly about organizing crap. not about surgery. - So? - So... I got to go back to the part that I like... which... it's kind of a gift. Hahn! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You paged, Dr. Hahn? Apparently when you ask for copies of the CT angio around here, people think it's all right to just give you the slices that contain the clot. Can you please bring me the entire CT? Absolutely, yes. I'll do that right now. Your dad was in the ER Today. - I know. - So you know he was drunk and he put his hand through a window. Yeah. Anything else? I know it was Susan's birthday, and I'm sure it was a very hard day for the both of you. And he wasn't actually a problem. He was kind of charming. But... he seemed very sad, and I'd hate to see it happen again. So maybe you should think about keeping a better eye on him. Every day is my mother's birthday. My mother was born in march. He lied. He's a liar. And I'm glad. Really, I'm glad that you found him charming. I'm sure he was delightful. He's a blast after five drinks. Not so much after nine, though. He gets a little weepy and mean. He's a drunk, Meredith. He probably came in and told you how wonderful you are, how sad he is that he doesn't get to spend more time with you. Yesterday he said that I was his favorite daughter. The day before, I was an ungrateful bitch. The week before, he wrote me a check for $20,000 because he said I deserved everything life had to offer because he was so proud of me, a lifetime's worth of proud. So thank you for letting me know that I need to keep a better eye on him. Thanks. Meredith, you want to come in for a minute and sit down? Meredith? I'm sorry about all this. Meredith, please. You have nothing to apologize for, nothing at all. I'm keeping you from doing your job. This is my job, at least part of it. Think of it as... the principal's office, only I'm the nice principal. Anyway, I promised your mom I'd take care of you. - I told you, you don't have to do that. - I know. I know I don't. But I do. I guess I'm still alive and kickin'. You're gonna be kickin' for a good long time now, Marcus King. You have always been my angel. I never would've made it through this day without you. - Come on. - Mandi, I mean it. Thank you. I thank you. My mama thanks you. and you know my daddy thanks you. You tell your mama and daddy I said they're welcome. I was wondering if you got a chance to finish up that paperwork. I wouldn't ask, but, you know... I think a lot of it was kind of important. No, I didn't. I was planning on... I just gotta... you know, finish it right now. Thanks. You're the best. With all due respect, this has reached critical mass. You saved his life, and he's taking you for granted. You know what he deserves? A long speech. You need to go right back in there. You need to give him a long speech. I don't do secrets. I don't do any of that 15-year-old "I'm gonna tell you, but don't tell anyone else." We're not talking about who made out with who at the halloween dance. This was a private family issue. Your dad's a drunk. I had to start cleaning up my dad when I was 7. That's when I turned into the grown-up of the family. So you got to wait till you were 24... Good for you. 'Night, bailey. - Sit down. - What? Sit down! - You okay? - What do you care? With your... hair products and your... perfect little face... perfect little life. What do you care how I am? My perfect little life? Have you been paying attention? I pay attention. I pay attention to people in all walks of life, all types. I notice people. I see people. It's guys like you who don't see people like me. I don't see you? Clear... I'm not talking about you, Shepherd. Just... guys like you... who don't see girls like me. We don't exist for you. We exist to do homework. We exist to build your ego up. I am a successful... married mother. I am chief resident. I am the chief resident of a major metropolitan hospital. I'm a surgeon who saved his life today. And he still doesn't see me. I may as well still be that high school girl with the... mushroom haircut and the coke bottle asses and the band uniform, the girl who didn't get to go to the homecoming dance 'cause it didn't even occur to him to ask me. All those late nights tutoring him, and it didn't even occur to him to ask. Band uniform? Really? Do I look like I want to be mocked by you right now? You don't. I'm just gonna say one thing. In high school, I was 110 pounds, and I hadn't yet figured out hair product, so I had a big afro, and... I had acne. And I, too... wore a band uniform. Sax. Oboe. And I would've been honored... to take a girl like you to homecoming. In some ways we grow up. We have families... We get married... Divorced. I was trying to think of a long speech. You know, like Bailey with the long speeches. Just everything I wanted to say to... It just is, I can't talk to you. That's why I talked to Meredith. I just... I don't know why. It used to be... It used to be... that I was the only person you could talk to, - you were the person I could talk to. - I know. I'm in love with this incredible guy, and we're having problems. And my best friend, he would know what to say to me about it. I need to be able to talk to my best friend. I cannot get through this without my best friend. Why isn't this easier? I don't know. Well, I want my best friend back. Me, too. But for the most part, we still have the same problems</i> that we did when we were 15. Hey, Rose. You know my name. I had to ask around, but now I know. Good for you. Good night. Hang on. You know, I should've recognized you from the OR today. We worked together for three hours, and it's thoughtless. I've worked on 36 of your surgeries, and today was the first time we made eye contact. Like I said, hospital's no better than high school. Good night, Dr. Shepherd. Someone figured out how to get back on the horse. What? No, no. I was just talking about work. Coulda fooled me. Hey, dad. You want to get a drink? Doctors S&S. How are we this evening? Hi, Sidney.* Derek, do you think I just could talk to you for one minute? Have a seat. I'm a lot of woman. Okay? I bring home the bacon. Fry it up in a pan, serve it with eggs or on a sandwich or crumbled up in a cobb salad. - Well, you do a lot with bacon. - Not just bacon. But, Derek, I bring a lot of things to the table. And I'm looking for a man who can do the same, a man who can meet my needs, all my needs. I just don't think you're ready. Well, you might be right. I won't let this affect our work if you won't. I won't. No matter how much we grow taller... grow older... Apparently I'm not good at meeting needs. And I don't bring that much to the table. I'm awkward and freaky. We are still forever stumbling. Do you want to get out of here? I do. Forever wondering... Forever... young.
