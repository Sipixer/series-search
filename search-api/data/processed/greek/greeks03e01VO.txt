get your o-chem grades back up. You left. Aren't you gonna get in trouble for leaving the lab? - I'll figure that out tomorrow. - I decided I don't want my trust fund. Don't play this game with us, Evan. We make an agreement, a pledge to not have sex with our tempters. It's the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Don't you read the scriptures? There's gonna be signs. - There is no more I-Kap. - I'm disbanding the house. I'm leaving. - For real, this time. - I'm in love with Cappie. - What are you doing? - I want to be with you. Don't ruin things with max because of some fleeting thought. - You don't even want to try? - Dumped? Casey says it wasn't 'cause of Cappie, - but I know it was. - How do you know? I saw them come out of a closet together. And then she dumped me. Never pick the girl. They'll leave you every time. You can count on it. So Casey broke up with Max because of you. Let the countdown to the end of the world begin! - Six... Five... - It's the end of the world, Cappie.</i> -  Four... Three... - What are you gonna do?</i> Two... One... You know, it's kind of weird to watch people while they sleep. Sorry. No, no, I meant him. Jeremy, go to your place. - Are you OK? - What? Still thinking about Casey and Max? Do you really think Cappie's the reason they broke up? That's what Max said. So are, like, Cappie and Casey dating now? That's so weird for me. Let's do something fun today, just you and me. We could drive up to canyon lake. - That sounds like... Crap! - It was just a suggestion. No, I have to finish my stupid O-Chem extra credit today. You're not gonna get in trouble for skipping out, are you? No. Hastings left the lab before I did. I just have to show him my results first thing tomorrow, which is why I have to get back to the lab to finish it today. OK, well, good luck. - Call me later. - I will. Dude! - Get off my hand, dude. - Ouch! Dumb-ass. - Hi. - Hey. What are you doing here? Why aren't you still at Fisher's? I came home early to check on you. - Thanks, Ash. - So, hitting the showers? - Do you want to come with me? - Why? What's going on in our room? Is someone else in there? Case. I had a pity party last night. Is that salsa? I may have eaten a box of frozen taquitos... ...and some cookies, but they were in the 100-calorie packages, so I had seven of them. I also watched the first hour of once twice and the last 45 minutes of the notebookonce. But today, I'm great. So you're OK about Max? No regrets? I'm still sad about Max. But today is a new day. That's out of my system, no dwelling, no more pity. I've even decided to stay positive about Cappie. I mean, I could sit here, angst all over myself about him turning me down, but who knows? Maybe when he finds out that max and I broke up, then... - I told him. - Told who what? What's that? Last night after you left the party I found Cappie on the roof and I told him that you and Max broke up. You did? And... And? It was super dramatic. It was during the countdown to the end of the &party and everyone's like, "eight, seven, six..." So... I mean, how'd that go? Well, he thought about it... ...a lot. I actually sat there for, like, five minutes until I had to pee, so... It means he's probably still thinking. Well, if... If Cappie wants to give us another shot, then... then he knows where I live. He can come over here or call me. In the Meantime I am just going to... Think about other things and... Just in Case. You have felt the love inside but now that it's through our sister cat is broken we want to fix you I wasn't sure if you wanted people to know or not, but... It's not like it's the end of the world. -= 301 =- "The Day After" VO By : ¤Aka¤, flolo, McFly, Jujuleder I'm sorry about your breakup with Max, but it's totally for the best. - Thanks, Laura. - I mean, he was a nerd, but he was hot. It was just so confusing. - Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for that. - Time to get some guns, girls! Are we raiding the Iki house? Everyone, so, last night, the ikis disbanded. Frannie's left the greek system for good. But despite all the bad things she did, deep down she really was a good... - What are the guns for, then? - It's for gotcha, the Omega Chis' campus assassin game. Starts today. Here are your dossiers. "The object of the game is to eliminate your assigned target. If you succeed, you take their target and the game continues until one lone survivor Remains." "And the winner receives a party at Dobler's hosted in their honor while the winner's house gets $500 and five points towards the greek Blue Ribbon." "The game starts tonight at the dead man's party hosted by Omega Chi." "Come as your favorite assassin or spy." I call Ethel Rosenberg. So are you gonna go tonight? I might just hang around the house. I got a gamma psi. No way. - Who'd you get? - Who do you think? - Yeah. Wanna trade? - Cappie can come to me. Or i can hunt him down tonight. I need water. Looks like someone had a lot of fun last night. - Is "fun" a euphemism for vodka? - I didn't have that much fun. Actually, i saw rebecca having a lot of fun last night, with a guy. - No, you didn't. - Who? It was hard to tell, given his face was inside her mouth. Becks, who's the mystery man? I'm really not telling any one of you. Is that my phone? Whose phone is that? I am the lord your god, who brought you out</i> of the land of egypt, out of the house of slavery.</i> You shall have no other gods before me...</i> it's actually "Q" from "Star Trek". Ever since i was a little kid, i liked to imagine they sounded the same. This could very well be the worst i've ever felt in my entire life. - What happened last night? - You don't remember the party? Getting frisky with your buddy grant? Your purity pledge? Oh, no. Grant and i kissed. If anyone from the house saw him, he's screwed. 'cause he didn't want to come out yet. Not to mention how they'll react having two gay guys in the house. One is fine, but two is just a bathhouse. So you guys didn't do anything else? No. Wait a minute. The only reason i kissed grant is 'cause i saw you and the landlady slide into second base. What's up with that? Well, you know, i've got really powerful pheromones. I had to fake a nosebleed to get out of there. At least both of us kept our purity pledges. Yeah. Hey, whose pants are those? Those would be mine. Oh, god. Morning! You're oot and aboot early this fine sunday. Looking for Max, eh? Yep. I'm a friend of his. I was hoping he can let me into the chemistry building for this lab today. - Have you seen him? - He left. - Do you know when he's coming back? - Oh, he quit. Quit? What, he quit his ra job? I think he had to since he quit the graduate program. Oh, in one night? He went back to england to work with George Stephanopoulos. Magda Stephanopoulos. Please deliver to: Casey Cartwright Zeta Beta House </i> did he tell you he was leaving the country? - Did you talk to him? - This morning. He said there was nothing here for him anymore. So he's really gone. Gee, i'm sorry. I call heaven and earth to witness against you today,</i> that i have set before you life... dale, do you think we can give q a rest for a little while? Yeah. ... that you and your offspring may live...</i> you know, school is a game of averages, and while i've never had to average in a "d" before, maybe it's not as bad as we think. So without extra credit, "d" on my midterm, even if i make 100 on the final, which is virtually impossible... ... my average is still a low "c." I should've listened to you. Whoever said "live every day like it's your last is an idiot. I guess the first rule of living every day like the world's gonna end is to make sure the world actually ends. Well, one world kind of ended. Even if i get "a's" in my other honors classes i'm still gonna drop below the required 3.5 cum. So, that's it. I'm out of the honors program. Sorry, rus. I'm dart gun shopping. - What's in the box? - It's for you. It's from Max. So you know he and i, broke up? - Did you know he went back to england? - He's gone? How? The grad program only gave him a temporary leave of absence. Apparently he's taking a permanent leave of absence now. I told you this would happen. Scorched-earth, you know, remember? He fled the country because of you. You can't blame me for that. It was his own choice. He was my friend and he was the only guy at cru who inspired me academically. And now he's gone. That's no reason for me to stay in a relationship with him. He just wasn't the right guy for me. - And Cappie is? - I'm not with Cappie, i don't think. - You don't think? - Look. I really am sorry about Max. But you can always call him, email him, - skype him. - I need him today, 'cause i didn't finish my grignard project last night. Grignard? Like that guy from entourage? - Maybe i can help. - Yeah, case, you can help me with my organic chemistry report on the guy from entourage. Forget it. There's gotta be something you can do. Is it too late to drop the class or take an incomplete? I looked into all that. Gentlemen, if we want to dominate at gotcha, then you pukes need all the practice you can get. Marksmen, on your... marks. Aim... fire at Wil... bur. Suck it, Wilbur! That's two points for Pickle, zero for Spitter. Have you talked to Cappie about this? He might be able to help. The last thing i need is his help. - Spitter's disqualified. - What? Pickle wins. - Why'd you shoot an old lady? - How are you an old lady? Spitter's right. You could've been a serial killer dressed to look like an old lady, for all he knew. Haven't you seen Steel Magnolias? I don't think that's what that movie was about, cap. No, but if you imagine they're secret homicidal maniacs it's much more enjoyable. Cut Spitter some slack. Everything OK, Spitter? You seem kind of... - clenched. - I'm fine. I wish i could say the same for Max. Yeah. I heard they broke up last night. How's she doing? Well, we all made choices last night and we just have to live with those consequences. I guess you're right. Hey, beav, i'm up next. You really don't remember what happened last night? The sex was pretty incredible, right? No, i totally remember. Just a little hazy, is all. But, yeah, last night was great. Then you remember what you said, about fate? Fate? Yeah. And eternity? Eternity? Really? I know you seem pretty intent on a small ceremony, but i wouldn't mind a big wedding in Maui, with our friends and family. OK, there's no way that we talked about that. Consider this payback for telling me dale's your boyfriend. Dude, you suck! Nothing happened. - We kissed. That was it. - Yeah, at a kt party. Look, we're just gonna have to be better and try to keep it quiet if this is gonna continue, OK? Is this gonna continue? What happened to you guys last night? You didn't come home. Nothing happened! I stayed at Rusty's, and grant stayed someplace completely different. Well, we have a busy day. I'm gonna take care of the deposit on the booze for tonight. Grant, grab some pledges, go pick it up this afternoon? Sure. You got it. Maybe later tonight's better. Yeah. It's a date. Sorta. Want a cat? Please? I'm all good, thanks. You're all dressed up. Oh, yeah. I need to find a sexy spy costume for tonight. Do you think i can pull off this la femme Nikita chick without the creepy'80s hair? I talked to Rusty and i'm a little worried about him. Don't be. He always sounds like that when he breathes. - You get used to it. - No, i think he might be in trouble. And i think i'm the last person he wants any help from. - Chocolate? - It's about polymer science. Really, the last person that... he got a "d" on his o-chem midterm and he's probably gonna fail out of the honors program. Fail out? He had a chance to make up for it with this extra credit project, but he skipped out on that to go to the party. I'm really worried about him. He's gotta get into the lab and finish it tonight. Tonight? We could both use help from our big sis. So fisher and i are going to the dead man's party as Mr. And Mrs. Smith. Which should be pretty easy for me since i already have plenty of dresses that show off my boobs. - You could go as Angelina Jolie in "Wanted". - What's the difference between angelina jolie in "Mr. And Mrs. Smith" and Angelina Jolie in "Wanted"? Four kids, maybe five. I'm thinking Sydney Bristow. You know what i always loved about Sydney Bristow? Her double life. It must have been pretty hard for her to have to keep all those secrets from her friends, her really close friends... - who she goes shopping with. - Nice try. I'm still not telling you who the guy was. I need cash. I need coffee. But i'm not giving up, becks. I will not rest until i find out who your mystery man is. Was she talking about your gotcha target? I wish. How's your bank account zero? I don't know. Must be some weird bank failure thing. Banks have been failing all over these days. What's going on? You can talk to me. OK. You remember homecoming? My parent problems? ... i gave up my trust fund. What the hell is wrong with you? Are you an idiot? I thought you, of all people, would understand. Oh, my god, you're poor. Not completely. I have some separate accounts, my credit cards. I'm gonna be fine. For how long? Good question. Do you need some cash now? I could help you out. I do. I need some cash for the deposit on the kegs for tonight. I could pay you back later. Actually, if i could trouble you for a favor, we could call it even. What do you think? And his sword shall devour flesh... ... from the long-haired heads of the enemies.</i> Rejoice in him, o heavens! Bow down to him...</i> what the hell is that? It's "Q" from "Star Trek". I've grown to find him oddly calming. I talked to jordan and she told me about the honors program and i'm here to help. I know how important this is to you, and the fact is, when you want something bad enough you'd do anything you can to get it. - It shouldn't take all day to figure it out. - I'm fine with it. You made one hasty decision without considering the repercussions. Don't let it ruin your future. No offense, but how are you gonna help me? I may not know anything about organic chemistry, but i know i can get you into that building. I don't... no, i don't know. Stop wasting time. Get your coat and let's go, now. You know you sounded like mom just now? I know, and i'm freaking out about it, OK? Did you two call to have the building opened? Yes. My brother here forgot his medication. - Yeah, he does look a little sickly. - Yeah, he's, hypoglycemic. - That's why he looks that way. - I'm hypoglycemic, not deaf. Rusty, i think you're looking a little flush, like you might go into shock. - I don't think i am. - Trust me. Think you are. I think you are. I think I'm feeling a little light-headed. Let me look in my bag for a candy bar. Hold on. I've got a candy bar. Really? Here. Eat this. - Eat this. - Why? Listen to him, Rusty. He's a professional. Oh, God! I think that did the trick. He's looking much better now. Really? It comes and goes. Thank you so much for your help. I'm gonna take him to the student health center. Thank you. You were great. You were so awesome. Thank you. Check you later. Look at all of these keys. You'd think at a science building they'd have fingerprint scanners. If we need his fingerprints, we can get 'em off my tongue. OK. This might take a while. Thank you, pledge. It's my costume for the dead man's party tonight. Aren't you a little wore out from last night's party? Yeah. So? Anyway, I know you seem to help Rusty out a lot with matters of the heart... - and flesh. - I'm glad you mentioned Rusty. He's been moodier than usual today. Is there like an engineering menses or something? Only when you're flunking out of the program like he is. Since when? Why didn't I know about this? I don't know. I figure he used to talk to Max more about that kind of thing. I don't know. Back to my problem, I'm having a... Used to? Maxi pad skipped the country. What? Since when? Why didn't I know about this, either? Did you... Did you just say "Maxi pad"? That is still funny. Yeah, I know. He left town this morning. Where's Rusty now? He left me a note. Seems he's gonna try to get into the chem lab tonight. But... - the thing that I'm dealing with... - I gotta go. - If you could finish up here... - I'm not even positive what this is. Kinda having a personal crisis. - If I could just have a minute... - You look good. Thanks. Delivery for Rebecca Logan. Rebecca got flowers! - What? - You got flowers? I bet they're from the mystery guy. Don't! "Last night was amazing." Signed, "E.C." Who's E.C.? Eric Chapman, from Pi Sigma? Edward Cullen. He's a fictitious character. Emma cannon? Is she a lesbian? Are you a lesbian again? - It's Evan Chambers! - Evan Chambers? Really? You got me. He and I made out at the party, and I know that's bad because of the whole Casey thing. You don't have to worry about Casey and the girl code. I can think of a million other reasons you should want to keep this a secret, but Casey and Evan are old news. So you should do whatever makes you happy. Evan's gonna be at the party tonight. You should give it a shot. Now, tell me everything that happened last night. God... Where to start? Thanks for letting me raid your closet. You are the only person I know that might have clothes resembling Austin Powers. Thanks. So you really didn't end up breaking your purity pledge at all? Nope. Aren't you proud of me? - The proudest. - Doesn't mean I'm not going to, though. I really like Grant. He's awesome. We're gonna give it a shot. What about the house and the brothers? Just have to keep it quiet. I did it last year with Heath. Come to think of it, I'm pretty good at sneaking around. Maybe I could be a real assassin. Do you know anything about the four horsemen of the apocalypse? Yes, Dale, and I get it. I'm going to hell twice for being gay and for having pre-marital sex. Hey, you know what? If the U.S. Legalizes gay marriage and Grant and I get married, am I safe on one of those? I had sex with Sheila. I was at that stupid party, and everybody was talking about the end of the world and the apocalypse, and it was like every easter Sunday back home. I was surrounded by all that partying. I kept thinking, what if the world really does end? I'd die a virgin. Did you ever have thoughts like that before you had sex? And then I saw the four horsemen... I thought it was the four horsemen. I realize now the more obvious answer is it's probably just... mounted campus security and not... the sixth sign of the apocalypse. But, you know, I digress. And then I heard his voice... Well, q's voice... telling me it was OK. So while you and Grant stayed back at the party and boozed it up, me and Sheila came back here and we did it. She was gone before you even got back. No, it's OK. I washed the sheets nine times today. But... The thing is, it wasn't the horsemen or q or anybody else that made me do it. I think I was looking for any possible reason to do it because I wanted to. And now I wish I wouldn't have because sex changes everything and you cannot change it back. You tried that one already. This is taking forever. I got it! - Wait, I just... - Yeah, now we gotta start over. Sorry. It's Jordan. She just texted me to see how we're doing. So what happened with your grades? I don't know. I guess I got a little distracted. You must really like her. Jordan's great. What I like most is the way I feel when I'm with her. Do you mean sexually? Well, we haven't... - exactly... - OK, no physical stuff. Sorry. Since we started dating, I kinda feel like that guy who doesn't have to think about studying all the time. Like, I could just hang out at the KT house with my arm around my girl. Just have fun, you know? And that's it. But you're not that guy. Thanks, Case. No, I mean... Any guy can be that guy. You're the amalgam, remember? You can't give up one for the other. Like you gave up Max for Cappie. I didn't give up Max for Cappie. I just realized he and I were too different. Are you bummed about Max? I really wanted it to work out with us. He's a really... good guy. He did kind of leave without saying goodbye, though. Well, sometimes guys leave, Rus. Sometimes they never show up. My nose. You guys know the windows are open in here, right? Come on. No killing till midnight. I need your help. Ashleigh saw the flowers and got the impression that I liked you. You don't have to sound so grossed out when you say that. So, she's coming here tonight thinking that we like each other and this is our first date or something. Help me, just for an hour or two. - What's in it for me? - I already paid you once. You paid me for the flowers. This is different. I'm spending an entire evening when I could be hitting on other girls. I'll pay you because I, unlike you, am not an insecure mess when it comes to flaunting my money. Sydney Bristow. Great costume. And Evan, you're... wearing banana republic. I'm Jason Bourne. I'm not a big costume guy actually. You would've thought for your own house's costume party you would've put forth a little more effort, but whatever. - Fisher, this is Evan Chambers. - Nice to meet you, man. - Yeah, you too. - So... Rebecca told me all about last night. - That was pretty crazy. - All that time you were with Frannie it was an attempt to get closer to Rebecca. Makes more sense than dating Frannie, I gotta say. - Pretty romantic, right? - The secret notes, the longing, the subtext. Who knew all that time you were talking there was happening on your side? I keep replaying some of the conversations you guys had and imagine them with what I know now. It's like watching the sixth sense the second time.</i> I really don't know what to say. Let me know what I can do to help. It's what I'm here for. Great. - Nice ninja costume, Cap. - Thanks! I was gonna head to the dead man's party tonight. - Thought it might come in handy. - Speaking of parties, how was the rest of your night last night? It was good. Ashleigh told me all about it. You know, the party... and stuff. So, I know about the party... and stuff. Case, can you grab a clean beaker - from on top of the shelf? - Yeah, sure. I just have to get this. So, this thing kind of looks like a giant bong? Got it. - I'm a ninja. - Case, can you quit messing around, OK? Case, I need a nitrogen bubbler. It's labeled in the drawer over there. Bubbler? Are you sure we're not making a bong? So what can I do? Chemistry's just like cooking, right? I watch the food network. - I could be like your sous-scientist. - But don't... Rusty, six hands are better than four. Fine. All right. Cappie, can you grab some hoses over there? I need two for the water and the reflux condenser, one for the nitrogen bubbler. Then we plug them into the valve right there. OK, I got it. See? I should totally switch my major. This is so easy. Maybe I'll take up chemistry next semester. I'm sorry. Case, can you grab a nitrogen bubbler? Maybe I'll just stand guard, over here. I think there were more parts to that. Pledges, - can you guys get me some water? - OK, right away. Very cute. So how much longer do we need to stay down here? Yeah, I've been thinking about that. Maybe we should just wait a while. - Like a half-hour? - Maybe longer. - Thirty-five minutes? - I want to slow down. You know, sex just changes everything. I'm enjoying right now, just getting to know each other. And after we get bored with each other, then we have sex? Can't believe I'm sneaking around the house with a guy again. - Again? - Calvin, here's your water. I think it's working. You're going through an awful lot of trouble to keep this secret. Look, seriously, you can tell me. Who'd you make out with last night? Not part of our deal, Bourne. Regret is a powerful emotion, huh? I'm starting to wonder if giving up my money was that great of an idea myself. - You got to stand up to your parents. - Yeah, but to what end? The money I have is gonna run out. I'm not gonna lie to you, Evan. From where I stand, you are pretty screwed. I think we both are. So we'll be screwed together. So we can keep these secrets just between us? Between us. - You suck! - What? If all you're looking for is a piece of ass, then forget it! I knew you would do something to screw this up. I'm all finished. I just have to write some of these results. - I can put stuff away? - No. Come on! I said "I'm sorry" like a thousand times. It was an accident. Did you "accidentally" hit on Casey, too? When? I've been sitting on this stool for almost two hours. Come on. Last night. Max told me everything. You admitted you weren't over casey, and then you pulled her into the closet to try and win her back. For all the crap you gave me for being a douche-mover with Jordan? At least I felt terrible for what I did. You, you've been acting like you didn't do anything wrong all day. I'm sorry. - You're right, I'm a douche-mover. - Stop! Cappie didn't... ... hit on me. He didn't pull me into the closet. I pulled him in and told him that I wanted to get back together with him. And he turned me down. Cappie and I aren't getting together. Are we? Crap! That's the leak detector. I forgot to turn off the gas! We gotta go! Case, come on! No, just leave it. - Let's go out the side door. - OK. Is that it? This can't be good. You two go back into the lab and leave out the window. What are you going to do? I'm gonna do what I do best. Test tubes, not bunnies. What the hell? I'm a ninja for the ethical treatment of animals. N.E.T.A? Not one of you guys again. Look, there are no animals in this building. Really? Then where are they? Did you know there are more animals used for testing than there are in the world? Well, that doesn't sound accurate. Well... OK. Cool. Hugs, not drugs! Hugs, not drugs! Well, Dale, you'll be interested to know that grant and I have decided to hold off on having sex. I'm actually not that interested. Thanks, Dale. So... How are you? You know, I've done a lot of thinking, a lot of soul searching, and... I think I've come to terms with my relationship with Sheila. I know what to do now. That'd be her. - Hey. - Hi, Dale. Hi, Dale's friend. I gave you my virginity and now I need to give you something else. I think we need to get married now. It's just my class ring. I'm gonna have to ask money from my parents to buy a real one, but... Dale, that is so sweet. And last night was really... Special. And you're a great tenant, but, I've been really busy with work. I might have to tend building C and I have to go to tucson next week and then there's my cat. So I will totally call you when things slow down, OK? Hey! How'd it go with hastings? My D is officially a C. Wait, that's it? After everything you had to do last night? It's good enough for now. Thank you for calling in reinforcements last night. You kinda saved me. You have passion for what you do. I think it's great. Honestly I'm kind of jealous, 'cause I probably would've blown it off. I have to warn you. I might not continue to be the cool fraternity guy that you know and love. Like, I mean. You might have to share me with engineering for a while. Sounds like a hot three-way. So, Becca and Evan? Yeah, it's weird, the fact she wanted to keep it a secret. She didn't feel the need to be discreet last time they hooked up. - People change. - Totally. Like Cappie. I really thought he'd come around. Yeah, after all the back and forth. I can't hardly blame him. I spent two years telling him "No." Couldn't expect him to wait forever. - Case. - What? You have felt the love inside But now that... - Stop singing. - Why? I'm getting to the "Meow Kitty Meow-Meow" chorus. - I'll see you at the house. - OK. Thanks, Ash. Nice vest. Seems to bring out my eyes, huh? That was pretty great, what you did last night. It was the least I could do. I wasn't gonna help him with the chemistry. Now I know how rusty feels at a date function. - Listen... - You know... I think the answer's pretty clear about us. You know. I felt so lame. Yesterday I actually thought you might change your mind and come for me in some grand movie moment that only exists in the deranged mind of Nora Ephron. Like I said, lame. Anyway, guess I'll see you around. Around it is. Hey, Cap? Gotcha. What the hell am I waiting for? Hey, Beaver, have you seen Casey? - Where's Casey? - Like, recently? Whoa there, numbnuts. I'm celebrating my independence today, man. - Come celebrate with me. - Actually, I gotta go. Wait! It's 1:00 in the morning. Where do you have to be right now? No one's looking. They're all too drunk to care. Speaking of drunk, I had the distinct displeasure of watching casey's enginerd actually puke into a coat pocket. - It was amazing. - Ex-enginerd. They broke up tonight. That's too bad. I thought they kinda made sense. He seemed really good for her, something that you and I definitely were not. - Why do you say that? - I don't know why you still care. - Please, tell me you aren't... - Aren't what? No, for a second I thought you were heading out to pay a visit to the ZBZ house. - So what if I was? - Well, they just broke up. It's not like that, OK? It's this whole thing. A few weeks ago, I told... I told her that I still had feelings for her, but she was with Max. And we agreed we couldn't be friends because I need to move on, and I was moving on... Yeah, I'm tired just listening to it. Aren't you tired? Do you really want to get back into that? Look, you don't know what you're talking about. You obviously have no intention of ever graduating and leaving this place. It's her senior year, man. Casey thinks about the future. How's that gonna work out? I have no ulterior motive here. We're friends, aren't we? Amphora brethren? Kha'y? Kha'y, Bing! Look, all I'm saying is you know how it felt to lose her once. You really want to go through that again? Come on, man. Come on, let's grab a beer. And sleep on it. If you wake up and feel the same tomorrow, I can't stop you.
