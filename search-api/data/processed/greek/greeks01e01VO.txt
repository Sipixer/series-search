Tomorrow night, we are gonna host over 1,000 girls for rush. And we're gonna get all types. We're the best, so of course we accept nothing less. Now, what can you tell me about Ashleigh just from her appearance? Anyone? There are four things that I see right away. One : the stain on the right side of her Theory shirt. Means she's sloppy. Two : her Marc Jacobs skirt looks brand new, but is last season, so I'm guessing clearance rack raid. Three : her Prada shoes, while quite nice, are too big for her feet. Probably on loan from a friend with better taste and more money. Four... The bags under her eyes. She's a party girl who's probably still drunk from last night. That's all true! Thank you, ladies. Speaking of, when talking to rushees, do not discuss drinking, drugs, or sex. - What if they ask about it? - We have a reputation to uphold. Lie! Remember, I don't care if she's the lamest, fattest girl in the room. Your mission is to make every girl who walks through that door wanna kill to be your best friend. Clear? Why don't we break for the day? Maybe... ... we could go to the retirement center, spread some cheer, rack up on our philanthropy hours. I know, I'm like a stand-up comedian all of a sudden, right? Rush just makes me so rowdy! Everyone with an ID, fake or real, meet me at Dobbler's in exactly one hour. Move out! Casey, walk with me. Oh, you came to play. I'm impressed. Frannie, please. This is rush. So, I have some inside scoop. Rebecca Logan, daughter of our fair state senator, is coming here this fall, and she's rushing I want her. Having a senator's daughter could do so much for us. That's as good as a Bush twin. But without the whole... war thing. Having a high-profile pledge like her puts more alumni money - in the party fund. - Exactly. The sluts at Tri Pi have already taken her to Canyon Lake, so we have to up our game, sell our reputation, and sell the fact that we have a direct line to the hottest guys on campus. From what I hear, she's a little boring, so give her all the help you can. Maybe recruit that stud boyfriend of yours and some of his Omega Chi brothers. No worries. It's in the bag. And Casey, as you know, I am graduating this spring. And I am seriously considering who will be my successor. Being president of Zeta Beta... Is the most prestigious honor offered at this college. It tells the world you are the best of the best. It changed my life. You're campus royalty. Land Rebecca Logan... and you could be the heir to my throne. - Call you later.  - No, Casey, wait. Do you know where Cal... 1x01 Pilot I'm Dale. All right. Hey, Dale. Nice to meet you. A Yankee, huh? I guess. I'm from Chicago. I didn't realize people still used that word. Oh, I didn't mean anything by it. I mean, you gotta be pretty smart to get in the honors engineering program. How'd you know that? This is the honors engineering floor. You know, it seems kinda weird puttin'us all in here together, considering how competitive the program can get. But... I mean, you... you don't gotta worry. Um, I am not into that stuff. I'm just real, real confident... ... when it comes to my grades. Graduated with a 3.7. Got a... 2110 on my SATs. - Cool. - Yeah, yeah. How about you? How'd you do? I... 3.9-something and 2280. Right, right... - Are you going to the big department orientation party tonight? - A party? College party? Yeah, it sounds great. Uh... germs. Fantastic. Okay, here is to the future of Madame President. Nothing is definite yet, but this is seriously what I've wanted since I came to Cyprus-Rhodes. It's huge for me. And now it's yours for the taking. Good lord. What the hell is that idiot doing? Good thing you won't ever date him. Oh wait, you did! You sure are eating a lot of chips, Ash. Rush starts tomorrow. I gotta go to the bathroom. Evenin'. Have you no self-respect? In my book, you gotta respect yourself a lot to walk around showing off a package this early before Christmas. Takes you back, doesn't it? Oh, yeah... to those drunken nights at the Kappa Tau house, having the choice of seeing you get stoned, or watching Old School for the 900th time. Don't go getting all nostalgic on me. Look, Case, the reason I broke up with you is... I dumped you. And the important thing is, we both can love again. Hey, Crappie. The name's Cappie. For that, I truly am sorry. Haven't they taught you Kappa Tau boys how to dress yourselves yet? Well, Evan, we Kappa Tau boys spend so much time with our clothes off, we just figured, why bother? Your girlfriend and I were just talking about that, actually. That's my cue. Always a pleasure. What were you thinking? I was young and naive. Call you later, Rusty. Promise. No, no, wait. Oh... My stupid brother. You have a brother? Casey? Casey? Boy in the house! You didn't tell'em you had a brother? Rusty, what are you doing here? You wouldn't return my calls. What was I supposed to do? I knew we'd have to figure out this new situation at some point. I accept that you go here now. It's... - A given? - I'd like to say unavoidable, but that sounds too harsh. - Inevitable? - That's it! You being here is... inevitable. So I thought maybe... I could coordinate a monthly brunch. Where we get together, catch up. I'm totally willing to do that. You might not have to. I've decided that I want to rush a fraternity. No. - Why not? - Euh... because guys in fraternities are hot. And... they have upper bodies. They don't study engineering. Polymer science. See, guys in fraternities would kick your ass just for saying "polymer science. " It's not like I'm saying I want to join your sority. Look, I was at an engineering party last night with my roommate, who I suspect is kinda racist. And we stood around a multipurpose room, talking about all the theoretical scientific inconsistencies of The Matrix. - And this is weird for you because... - There were robots, Casey. Robots. Look... I wanna have a real college experience. - I wanna have fun. - You don't know how to have fun! But I can learn! Isn't that what college is for? Hell, no. You and I, we've always stayed in our respective worlds. I never crashed one of your gay camp sleepovers. - Wilderness excursions. - Whatever. My point is... you have your world, and I have mine. But I don't have a world anymore. Please. Help me. I'm trying to help you. You're not fraternity material. You're just gonna be disappointed. I'm gonna do it, Casey. - Monthly brunches. I'll call you. - I will join a fraternity! Okay, gather'round, everybody. Gather'round. Eyes and ears on me. The first house we're gonna be visiting tonight is Lambda Sigma Omega. Over the next couple of hours, we're gonna be visiting all 14 houses on campus. So... if you have any last-minute letters of recommendation, Be sure you get those out tonight. Hold on to those letters of recommendation until you get to the house of your first choice. Letters of recommendation? Is he serious? They're not required. More of an unspoken necessity. Weed out. Medical school admissions are less involved than this. Welcome to the Greek system. So how important is athletics to the Lambda Sigs? Real important. We're intramural champs four years in a row. You guys play football? Oh, I played for a year. In Little League. I was All-State quarterback for my high school. The university courted me, but I opted out of playing so I could focus on sports medicine. - What was your name again? - Calvin Owens. Glad to meet you. Let me introduce you around. So you guys have some raging toga parties, huh? Anyway, wax is okay, but it builds up in your hair. - Pomade's better. - See, I learned this trick when I was modeling in Milan. You just take a... - You modeled in Milan? - Oh, nothing major. I mean... just a couple summers. I was offered a deal with Abercrombie, but I turned it down so I could come here and study communications. That's what I'm studying! - Get out! - Calvin, right? Shalom. Calvin Rosenberg. I really love traveling places with beaches. And sand. - Yeah... sand's great. - Excuse me. - Casey, can I borrow you a sec? - Thank you. That girl was verbally handicapped. Rebecca Logan's here... I've greeted her, and I've already told her that I wanted her to meet you. Make me proud. Rebecca? Hi. It's so nice to meet you. I'm Casey Cartwright. - Hi. Beautiful house. - Oh, well, thank you. It was designed by the Irish architect Charles D. McKenzie, and erected in the 19th century Colonial style. - I know. I'm a fan of his. - You have great taste. So let's cut to the chase. Tell me about the Zeta Betas socially. We have an awesome time. We cohost mixers with Omega Chi, who are the hottest guys on campus. We have formals, date dashes, unbelievable trips. And those don't get too crazy, do they? Our reputation on campus is based on our tradition of upholding the graceful qualities of a fine, honorable woman. Good for you. Well, it was great meeting you, Cassie. Sitting this one out? Shoulda sat out this whole night. I had no idea it'd be this hard. These guys aren't gonna take me seriously. Even these fish are judging me. Maybe you shouldn't take it so seriously. It's a fraternity. It's all about fun. - So have fun. - You having fun, Calvin Rosenberg? I'm having a blast. Look... it doesn't matter what I told those other guys. I'm a Omega Chi legacy. - I'm stuck here. - You're a legacy, so you can't screw up. Relax. You seem like a really nice, smart guy. Just be yourself. And if that doesn't work, be someone else. No one knows you here. You can be anyone you want. All right? Hey. Ready? Let's go. Time's running out. So we have a lot of parties here. It's really cool. There's... Hey, guys. My name's Calvin Owens. My dad was an Omega Chi, class of'85. This is my buddy Rusty Cartwright. He was on The O.C. You're Casey's little brother. - How'd you know? - I'm her boyfriend. I'm Evan. - I didn't know she had a boyfriend. - I didn't know she had a brother. Not till yesterday. You know, she also didn't tell me you were rushing. Well... she wanted it to be fair. No playing favorites. Shoot, well, that's what this process is all about. So tell me, Rusty, why are you rushing? To join a fraternity. Well, I don't know if you're aware of the following statistic. 2% of the American male population was in a fraternity. It's not a lot of people, but that 2% represents some of the most influential men in this country. 43 CEOs of the top 50 U.S. companies are Greek, and all but three of the U.S. presidents since 1825 were in fraternities. But, I mean, prestige aside, I like the idea of having a group of friends who share a sense of tradition fostered by an institution that's over two centuries old. Brothers for life. Right? That is the best answer I have heard all night. Okay, everybody, time's up. One house to go. Hey, Rusty, you know... when you guys are done, you should swing back by. You know, we'll be hanging out. Just... nothing too fancy, having some beers, maybe some girls... for you single gents. Wink wink, nudge nudge. But seriously, you should come by. - Thanks, Evan. - No problem. Okay. Here you go, guys. Good luck. I'll... I'll see you later. I'm Wade Matthews, rush chair. So... who here has heard about us? Knows our reputation? If you have, please, raise your hand. Wonderful. All right, everyone with your hand up, get out. Now. All right, you three... come with me. Come on. All clear! Holy crap. We prefer virgins. Welcome to Kappa Tau. Kappa Tau! I'm gonna go grab a drink. I'm Cappie. President of Kappa Tau Gamma. Sorry for all the secrecy, but the Hellenic ass clowns don't allow this type of fiesta during rush. So we keep it on the D.L. Name? Home state? I'm Rusty Cartwright. I'm from Illinois. Really? Do you know Casey Cartwright? Yeah, she's my sister. - I didn't know she had a brother. - Did she not tell anyone about me? - How do you know her? - Uh... in the Biblical sense. From church. - Trade ya. - Hey, I know this guy. Rusty, this is the Beaver. Like the TV show? The TV... the TV... Who sent you? What are you, a narc? Come on, there's someone else I want you to meet. Hot girl, Rusty. Rusty, hot girl. Okay, now it's real easy. It's salt, shot, lime. S, S, L. Yeah, whatever you need, little man. First, we sprinkle a little salt on her tightly toned tummy. We take the shot in this hand. Slip the lime into her mouth. Right. I can do this. Sorry. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I'm so... What the hell did you do to my girlfriend? I never had tequila before. Calm down, calm down. It was an accident. - He didn't mean to do it. - He spit on my girlfriend's face. But licking salt off her stomach is acceptable? - I'm gonna kick your ass! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - I gotta go. - No, no, no, it's okay. - The bad man can't hurt you now. - No... no, I'm late. It's great meeting you, Cappie. It's great meeting you too. I like him. Salt me. Excuse me. I'm looking for Evan. Sorry. Evan ? Susan, don't. - Yes? - I'm looking for Rusty. - It's a little early for visitors. What are you, one of his frat bros? Rusty? I'm gonna wait outside. Look, I'd like to personally apologize for last night. My actions were... they were simply inexcusable. Look, I'd never do anything to hurt Casey. I don't know you all that well, Evan, but I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt. That means a lot. You know, I knew you were the type of guy I wanted in my corner. And that is why I'm going to offer you a bid to join the Omega Chis. - Really? Are you serious? - Absolutely. You're a smart guy. - You know, we'd be lucky to have you. - Thanks, Evan. - No problem. So I can trust that... what happened last night, that's just between us brothers, right? You're not gonna tell Casey? Look... I made a horrible mistake. Okay? But... it was one transgression. And it's not gonna happen again, so... I don't see why Casey would need to know. Take that speech last night. 43 CEOs. All those presidents. I mean, we are all fallible. - Yeah, but she's my sister. - We could be your brothers. Look, consider this a test of loyalty. - You're asking me to lie. - I'm asking you not to tell her. Come on. Don't be such a Boy Scout. It's time to man up. You wanted to join a fraternity. This is what it's all about. And brothers stick together. For life. That's Rebecca Logan. Rebecca, do you remember me? The architecture freak? - Cassie? - Casey. Isn't it against the rules for you to talk to me and hold me captive in public restaurant rooms during rush and stuff? And yes. That's why this entire conversation is off the record. I'm aware that you basically have your pick of any sority on campus, but no one wants you more than Zeta Beta. You could join another sority and be their star, but at Zeta Beta, you'd be with the best. We have the best parties, the hottest guys, and I am willing to give you not only a bid right now, but a bonus offer you can't refuse. - What are you offering? - Anything. You name it, it's yours. I want my own room. Done. - Family vacation homes? - We girls share everything. I'm in. - Are you gonna tell your sister? - I have to. Don't I? If you do, you can kiss Omega Chi good-bye. - Well, what other choice do I have? - You could forget about this whole ridiculous fraternity thing. I'm sure your sister is a lovely person. But it doesn't sound like you two are that close anyway. You said so yourself... she wouldn't help you with rush. - Rusty? - Yeah, Dale? I know that that I may seem like just a Christian hick with a very bright future ahead of him, but... Can I give you some advice? Sure. These guys. You've known'em for a couple of hours. But she's been your sister for 18 years. She's always gonna be your sister. Now... I know that you came here to have fun and join a fraternity, and sin in the eyes of God, but... you could be missing out on creating a relationship with her. At least you're not wandering into the house. - That's an improvement. - I need to talk to you. Is this about brunch? I'm still working on scheduling. All TBD. It's not about brunch. This is about you listening to me for two minutes. Can you do that? - Did you go through rush? - Casey! What is it? I was at the Omega Chi house last night, - and I saw Evan... - Wait, I don't know if I want to hear this... - With another girl... - Rusty! - He was in a private room. And... they were kissing. And, you know, they were gonna... have sex. - You misinterpreted. - I didn't. - Then you're lying. - Casey. Have I ever lied to you? Are you okay? Um... no. - I gotta go. - Wait. Casey, talk to me. - Is there anything I can do? - Look, I don't need your help, Rusty. Just go away. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Uh, yeah, it's... it's nothing. Honey... I heard about Evan hooking up with Rebecca Logan. Rebecca Logan? She was the girl? That whore! God, she's ugly, and... I gave her a bid this morning. Did she accept? Seriously? Sorry, sweetie. Have you talked with Evan yet? No, I'm too mad. I don't want him to think I'm dumping him out of spite. You're breaking up with him? He cheated on me. With one of our pledges. So she did accept the bid. Yes, she accepted the stupid bid. Well, all I'm suggesting is you think about this : I hate to say it, but but he is Evan Chambers. His family owns half this state. You two are on your way to becoming "the" couple on campus. When I mentioned you being president someday, I can't lie and say that he didn't factor into that. What it comes down to is, how bad do you want it? I want it, but... Think of it like this. You would be giving up everything you worked so hard for because... ... he slept with someone else? That's not fair. So what do I do ? Just overlook it? Forgive and forget? Listen to me. If you want to be powerful, then you have to learn to not let things like this get in the way of what you want. You do what you need to do to make it right in your mind. That's it. "Mr. Cartwright, you are cordially invited to attend the Bid Night party this evening at 8:00 p.m. at Dobbler's. Congratulations, welcome to Omega Chi Delta. " "Rusty, you're a Kappa Tau. Cappie. " You up for some competition ? You know I suck at pool. Ah, that's okay. I'll give you a handicap. Sure. I'll break. So what brings you out here tonight? You do remember that I introduced you to this place? I'm just taking a night off from Greek life. A night off at my secret place. Secret place ? You sound like a 12-year-old girl. Let's put some stakes on this, huh? It's no fun playing when there ain't something on the line, right? If you win, what do you want? How about 100 bucks? And what do you want? What do you think? You're trying to take advantage of me because I'm a little drunk and a lot bad at this game, aren't you? You're on. Wait, what's my handicap again? Two balls. Of course. I took a class over the summer. So, where's Numbnuts? Evan's at Bid Night. I was talking about Rusty. Now... now how would Evan feel knowing you think his nuts are numb ? I don't know what Rusty's doing. Don't you think it's a little weird that we dated for over a year and you never mentioned you had a brother? Sibling rivalry, I guess. And, uh... something I'm not talking about on my night out. You know, Cap, I hope I didn't hurt you when I ended things. Who said it's over ? Last ball. Don't scratch. Did you mean to do that? No. Oh, hey, Rusty. What's up, man? You made it. Yeah. Where's Evan? By the bar. Ginger ale. Excuse me. Evan. There you are, man. Here he is. Congratulations, buddy! We're happy to have you. I told her. You told who what? I told Casey you cheated on her. When ? What difference does it make? I just thought that you should know that. And also, I'm decling your bid. You don't decline us. All right, we decline you. You couldn't keep your mouth shut. You had to go be a little bitch about things! She's devastated because of what you did. She's too good for you. That was a mistake, little man. Hey, nothing to see here, folks. Everybody, go back to your beers. What the hell are you doing? I'm manning up. Get this punk out of here. This is a private party. I want his ass thrown in jail. Come on. Those aren't mine either, in case you're wondering. The less information, the better. How about some breakfast? You make such tasty omelets. How about it, huh ? For old times'sake? - Later, Cap. - We're not gonna cuddle? Last night was a one-time thing. Well, it wasn't just one time last night. I'm saying... it's done. Not to be repeated, in every sense of the word. Understand? Last night was... it was just a fond trip down memory lane. Fond ? Call me! Okay, it's clear. Go out that window. There's a lattice you can climb down. Listen, you know, this doesn't mean I'm gay or anything. I'm not gay. I was just drunk. See you, Keith. It's Heath. Right. We were studying. For a project. And I fell asleep. You guys suck. What the hell were you thinking? A bar fight with Evan ? You're the size of, like, one of his arms. - I was defending your honor. - My honor ? That's the lamest thing I ever heard. Why couldn't you just... ... stay out of it? He's my boyfriend. - It's my business. - You mean, was your boyfriend. You're staying with him? You're pathetic. Don't judge me! Don't you dare judge me. I don't need Jiminy Cricket sitting on my shoulder telling me what I should and shouldn't do. That's... ... why I didn't want you here in the first place. It's simple, Case. Someone cheats on you, and you dump them. I appreciate your idealism, but you'll learn you left black and white back in high school. It's shades of gray from here on out. Doing the right thing isn't always the right thing. Especially here. - This is my life... - Your social life. Which is my life. What do you want, Rusty? Do you want me to lose everything that I've worked so hard for because Evan screwed up? Do you want me to become a social piranha? Pariah. What ? I don't... I don't know what you're saying. Pariah. Social pariah... How did you think it was piranha? No one wants to hang out with a piranha. What the hell's a pariah? I won't judge you. I just want to be part of your life. Okay. Really? Thank you for defending my honor. You're welcome. Does your eye hurt? No. Do you remember the last person who gave me a black eye? Yeah. Me. Fore. Spitter! A fine day for nine holes, wouldn't you say? Indeed, Cappie, indeed. What brings you to our fair house? I think I'm gonna need a putter and a screwdriver for this shot, pledge. Well, I... I wanted to talk to you. I know I missed the deadline for bid acceptance, but I still want to join. I wanna be a Kappa Tau. Oh, too late, buddy. We've already reached our quota. You were supposed to let us know by last night. Look at that. But I was in jail. Really? For what? Bar fight. - Anyone good? - Evan Chambers. - Who started it? - He did. - Who ended it? - Guess I did. You, uh... hit him with one of these? Pledge paddle. Would you excuse us, pledge? Is that part of the whole hazing thing? Calling'em "pledge"? No. Can't remember his name. So the only person that can overturn a missed deadline is the president of the fraternity. But aren't you the president? Oh, yes I am. And... I've considered your appeal. The course awaits. Let's go, pledge. You know, the thing for me is, I don't know how to open up. I hide. So is this the extent of hazing? I wasn't finished opening up, Rusty. But to answer your question, no. You have a lot of hell ahead of you. Look, Cappie, I got my first class tomorrow at 8 :00 am, - so I probably... - You registered for an 8 :00 am? Oh, wow. You are screwed, man. Dad would be so proud. Look, Evan and I talked a lot about this, and we agreed we don't want things to be awkward between us. Now that you're here, you both are gonna be a part of my life, and I really want you to get along. Look, Case, it's not that Evan and I don't get along. - It's more the fact that... - She wasn't talking to you, dumbass. I think she meant me. Right? Rusty. I hope you and I can grow to be, if nothing else, great friends. Truce? Truce. I owe you one. Well, then. Let's make it official. Drink on it, huh?
