- Maybe someday you'll forgive me. - For burning down my house? I'm gonna go before my Benz turns into a pumpkin. Later, Sorry to leave you hanging like that. Maybe I can make it up to you? - Like a date? - Yeah, like a date! - What are they doing? - Dancing. - What's that? - I think it's a joke. - I don't think it's funny. - It's not a joke, we will handle it. Look who's home! How many nights in a row can you spend somewhere else before you start calling that place home? Cappie can't stay here I'm kind of stuck commuting. I just miss our pre-sleep gossip sessions. Last night, I took my laptop to bed and fell asleep reviewing my old status updates and TMZ videos. But isn't it nice having this whole room to yourself? It's officially the biggest single in the house, or in any sorority house in the world. I just miss you! What? What's wrong? - You kind of reek. - I reek? Of what? Stale beer and pepperoni. And... feet. I smell like the KT house? I can't even tell. - I guess it grows on you. - That's what I'm afraid of. So you didn't shower there? No, not when the shower gets dubbed "the Vomitorium" during parties. - Was a boy here? - The All-Greek - Softball Tournament is this weekend. - Of course! How could I forget? - It's worth five Blue Ribbon points. - ???? It's a good chance for me to meet a hot baseball-boy of my own. You're ready to jump back on the dating horse again? I'm ready to ride that horse like a bucking bronco. - Awkward. - Yeah, you might be all settled down. Smelly, but I'm ready to meet a fun new guy. - Nice shirt. - Thanks, the pledges made it for me. I think they're starting to respect me as a Pledge Educator. You think they misspelled it on purpose, to be funny? - Like, school with a 'k'? - I decided not to ask. - What's up, Rusty? - What'd you call me, pledge? Or wait, is it Randy? It's Rusty. But you should call me by my KT name which is Spitter. Or Mr. Spitter. Where's your pledge pin, pledge? It's supposed to be on your shirt at all times. - It's in my backpack. - Put it on. That's a funny shirt you guys made. - What's so funny about it? - Now? Nothing. Bye, Dumptruck. So how are things with you and Grant since you guys came out as a couple? The house has really been supportive Except for the whole tiara incident. The tiara what? Can I get a small coffee? Someone left a couple of tiaras on our door after the Fairy Tale Ball. But it's no big deal. You know how it is guys are always making fun of each other. Guys make fun of me all the time. And some girls. I feel like I've barely seen you since I've been dating Grant. You'd like him. He's actually a great guy. Spend some time with him and you'd see what I mean. Maybe the three of us could hang out tonight? - Yeah. That sounds like fun. - What sounds like fun? I was just talking about the three of us hanging out tonight. - The three of us? Fun. - Yeah. It's gonna be really fun. -= 313 =- "Take Me Out" Kappa Team Tell me again, why are you crop-dusting my room - with lemon-scented cancer chemicals? - Ash is trying to meet a new guy and she's worried about second-hand smell. God! What is this? It's either a relatively recent tuna fish sandwich or a really old ham and shrimp one. So, Ash is in the market for a new guy? Yeah, I was thinking of setting her up with this Lambda Sig on IFC. He's crazy hot. I mean, temperature-wise. He sweats. Or what about a nice KT? Then she could acclimate to the smell by being around the house more. I don't know. Ash has a really sensitive nose. Come on. What about Beaver? He's just like a big puppy dog, who doesn't know how to fetch, but he's housebroken. Mostly. Right. I doubt Ash will click with a guy who got a mild concussion from attempting to parachute off the roof with a bed sheet. - Every guy tries when they're young. - It was last semester. But he's matured a lot over the break. Come on, it's perfect. They're both tall. OK, he's really nice, and cute... - Super cute. - I guess it won't hurt to try, right? Seriously, you don't smell this? No. What's wrong with this? It's just ripe. - What? - Gosh... Then the miracle of Vesuvius happened, as the cups were drained and beer rained down upon them like tears of joy from the heavens above. OK, that's it for today's lesson. But before we wrap up here, I'd like to reiterate the importance of wearing your pledge pins at all times. It is a constant reminder that first and foremost, you are Kts through and through. And I've caught some of you slacking lately. Yeah, I kinda lost mine. You have any extras? - I saw you wearing it 2 hours ago. - You're the one who told me to take it out of my backpack where I knew I wouldn't lose it. - Yeah, Anthony Hopkins? - I lost mine, too. But actually, it was the temporary one. I lost my first one last semester. The temporary one was my pledge pin! It's gone? It's somewhere in the house or on campus. I'll just order a few replacement pins. Does anyone else need one while I'm at it? I still have mine but I know I'm a KT pledge. Do I need a pin to remind me? Yes, you do, OK? It's a KT tradition. - It's a rule. - But wee Kts, man. We're not supposed to follow the rules, right? OK, fine. Just wear them around the house, at the very least. And try not to lose them. Meeting adjourned. That's so cute. Rusty's acting like a man. It's not easy being a hard-ass when your older sister is emasculating you. I will see you after class. Bye, Rus. Cap, I have a question for you. When Casey was with Max, I know you didn't like him. - That's correct. - No. That's not the question. That was too easy. Hit me with something harder. I have this problem. Calvin wants me to spend time with his new boyfriend who I cannot stand. Fortunately, that's an easy one, too. Do what everyone does in that situation. Simply pretend you like each other in front of Calvin. What if I can't pretend? 'Cause I really don't like him. You don't have to like him, you just have to tolerate him. You guys are going out tonight ? - Yep. You ? - Yeah, big date. How do I look ? If you're gonna ask us how your butt looks in those jeans, don't. - Who's the lucky girl ? - Rebecca. - Really ? - Yeah. - You asked out Rebecca Logan ? - Actually, she asked me. - If she pays do you have to put out ? - Only if I order steak. - What are you guys doing ? - He's making me hang out with Rusty. - He's my friend. - He's a KT. And he can't stand me. What, you hit him with a pledge paddle ? No, but we duct-taped him to a wall last year and then I accidentally got his girlfriend to move away. You got his girlfriend to move away ? Do not high-five him. All right, guys. Do I look fat in these jeans ? Do you realize how many sweaty heads have worn this ? You can put this inside. I haven't blown my nose in it and I washed it last week. Thanks. I think I'll risk it with the helmet. Let's go, Ash. Here we go. That was supposed to be a slow-pitch. That was way faster than slow. Ash, that was... so close. Close to what ? Decapitation ? All right. Here we go. Let me... I'm gonna show you the proper way to handle a bat. Okay. Personal space, Beaver. I really hope that was a roll of tokens in your pocket. Gosh, just trying to help with your swing. First : Stop winking at Cappie. And second : That was the most cliché, sleazy date-movie move, - and you know it. - I didn't know, I swear. - You don't think that was sleazy ? - I don't know what "cliché" means. Guys, we need to help each other before the game, work with each other during the game, and shower with each other after the game. OK, all right. Seriously, what do you think about KT and ZBZ pairing up ? Ash, what do you think ? Sounds good to me. Maybe... We have to go to the bathroom. - I don't need to go to the bathroom. - I think she meant me. Let's go. Those don't look like ginger ales. Pale ales. I figured these could help ease the tension. Thank you, Grant. Just don't sell me out if you get carded. But if you're looking for payback for me duct-taping you to the wall, - I guess here's your chance. - I just remembered... I'm underage. But it's not like I haven't had one before. Forget about the duct-taping-me-to-the-wall thing. It's in the past. It was some stupid prank. Like those tiaras someone left outside your door. Yes, which is also in the past. Not really. We don't know who did it. - And we don't care. - I do. - And I think you should, too. - It's not a big deal. It seems pretty harmless. - It didn't happen to you. - Nope. But I was duct-taped to a wall. - I thought that was in the past. - Like the tiaras. Boy, this sure is fun. You really thought Beaver would be a good match for me ? - Well, you're both tall. - Yeah, sure. We're both tall and he's cute and he's got big, manly biceps, - but he's just so... - Sweet ? ...mentally challenged. No offense. I appreciate the thought. But I just don't think KTs are my type. You two. We'd love to have ZBZ over for a housewarming when our new place is finished. But you already warmed our house to the ground. Let it go, Natalie. What's done is done. Thanks, Katherine, we really appreciate it. Of course, ZBZ is still not invited. On principle alone. I saw you guys rehearsing with some KTs. - Your partner, perhaps ? - It's nice to know some houses aren't concerned with winning Blue Ribbon points. We figure you've already slept with all the umpires, so... And we haven't committed to a partner because we are concerned with winning. - So there. - You'd better choose soon, - because the pickings are slim. - Really ? - Who are you playing with ? - The Omega Chi's. It's an obvious match. The number one houses always play together. But you know that. ZBZ used to play with them... until you were number four. Wait, can we split it ? My pick, my treat. All right, fine. - But I'm treating next time. - If there is a next time. - We'll see how the rest of tonight goes - Although, we may have to choose... something a little more low-budget. No problem. We can go for coffee, or a movie, or something simple. That's funny. Because we met, we had sex, then dinner and now coffee. It's like we're moving backwards. Who knows, maybe after coffee, it'll be love at first sight. Love at first sight ? You really believe in that ? You don't ? I learned in my Human Sexuality class it's purely chemical. The high you get from perceiving someone as romantically appealing is simply your brain responding to an endorphin boost based on visual stimuli and pheromones. That's very clinical. And cynical. It's clinically cynical. It's a biological response. It's also probably why we jumped right into bed when we first met. So love doesn't exist ? Nope. I believe in dating and relationships but... love is a myth. That went well last night. I tried to tolerate him but he's just such a... such an... Omega Chi. Hello, so am I. Yeah, but you don't flaunt it. - Excuse me ? - You know what I mean. I can't spend time with him. I'm sorry. We'll have to hang out separately. I'm sure he's not thrilled - to spend time with me, either. - Fine. He's got a study group tonight, anyway, so... - if you don't have any plans... - I don't have any plans. You see ? We can make this work. Yeah, but I refuse to be your shared-custody child of divorce. You could have two birthdays and two Christmases. One of you will have to give in, eventually. Totally. Eventually. I can't believe you guys have poached eggs and hash browns ! We have cereal, milk and more cereal at our house. I am walking you home every morning. It's nice to see chivalry isn't dead. Girls, the Omega Chi's are here ! Take me out to the ball game Take me out with the crowd Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks I don't care if I never come back Let me root, root root for the home team If they don't win it's a shame 'Cause it's one, two, three strikes you're out At the old ball game Omega Chi would like to cordially invite ZBZ to partner with us for the All-Greek Softball Tournament this weekend. No, thank you! We're going with the Kts. You guys are a bunch of douchebags. Please leave. It slipped, OK? It was buttered. I assure you ladies that in no way reflects my ability to throw an un-buttered softball. OK, so you guys really want to play with the Kts after that demonstration of athleticism? Come on. There's no need for profanities here. - The Kts asked us first. - ZBZ is a democracy, not let's all hang out with whatever house Casey's current boyfriend's in. So, all those in favor of partnering with the Omega Chi's for the softball tournament? So, we cordially accept your invitation. You kind of insulted Cappie, and me, back there. I'm sorry but after all that crap about the cycle, slipping to number four-ish this is our chance to show everyone that we're back on top. They asked us, not the Gamma Psi's. Don't you want to throw this in Natalie's face? Attached to a brick. But why would Omega Chi choose us? Because we're moving up! This is huge! Are you so against this because of your loyalty to Cappie? Or do you honestly believe it would be better for us to play with KT than with the Omega Chi's? You know I love Cappie, but this is for the good of the house. And there's no "I" in team. Or ZBZ. I know. But the Kts are so much more fun. Do you want to have fun, or do you want to win? Isn't this fun? Just the two of us? We haven't hung out like - this in a while. - Yeah, this is great. Nice shot. Have you been practicing? You're destroying me. After this you wanna order. A pizza and play some video games? A little Call of Duty? Why don't we call Grant? He's great at that game. Helped me get past that crazy level with all the tanks. What? I gotta keep trying. Spitter. Man, I saw some pledges not wearing their pledge pins again. It's no big deal. I'm on it. What's going on, man? Haven't seen you around in a while. Not even the occasional appearance at Gentleman's Choice. I've been a little bit domestic lately. I heard you're dating somebody in your own house now. Who is that Marco, right? No. Actually, his name is Grant. - Cute? - I just realized the two of you - look way too much alike. - So insanely hot. Totally get it. Heath, we're just finishing up our game. You wanna play winner? - We were switching to video games? - No, let's keep playing pool. Dang. You're up, Heath. I thought it was just supposed to be the two of us? Separate time? And you pull this stuff with me and Heath. Not cool, Rus. - I just figured... - it was nice catching up. Yeah. Wait, he knows he just won, right? I talked to Ash and she's pretty set on playing with Omega Chi. - And so are the rest of the girls. - You think Ashleigh's worried Beaver's gonna date-movie molest her again? Because we had a talk - he's trying new clichémoves. - That's awesome. But not the issue. ZBZ's just been doing a lot with KT lately the girls want to branch out and maybe win. I totally understand. Kts aren't jocks. We can't run. We can't throw. Hell, we get winded just tapping a keg. Case, can I borrow your... Boy on the floor! She was a fiery little pistol, wasn't she? - So you're not mad? - No. But I must warn you, what we lack in physical ability, we make up for in heart. And our hearts are set on crushing the Omega Chi's at all things crushable. I'm just sorry ZBZ will become collateral damage. - Really How do you plan on crushing us? - Since you're playing with Omega Chi we'll just have to team up with some other very athletic sorority and kick your very attractive asses. Should I be scared? You care to make a little friendly wager? How much? Something much more valuable than money. How about... sexual favors. - Let's skip the betting. - All right. - Thanks for the movie. - Yeah, I can't believe that was your first time to see The Princess Bride. It's a classic. "Mawwage." "Twoo wuv." Don't pretend like you didn't tear up at the end. Maybe I did. What's your point? - "Twoo wuv?" - Please. It's a silly movie. It's not real. There's no such thing. So you weren't in love with Cappie? No. Were you in love with Casey? - Yeah. I think so. - Yeah, you're not with her nown so - what does that say about "twoo wuv?" - It doesn't mean it can't happen. Like it did with my parents? Or yours? Not exactly the earth-shattering, life-altering revelation they make it out to be in the movies. That doesn't mean it's not real. Do you have proof? No. I just believe in it. I believed in Santa Claus once, too. I'm really sorry, Calvin. You're right. That wasn't cool. Grant can have you this weekend. Grant might have me every weekend if you keep pulling crap like that. I know. I just saw you and Heath together and it was really selfish. I feel like a real jerk. If we're gonna do this whole "separate" thing, - you might have to go somewhere else. - Calvin told you about that? - I had to be honest with him. - What are you doing here? I came to apologize for what happened with Heath. Who's Heath? - You said you were nest. - Not unnecessarily honest. Calvin, who is Heath? Heath is an ex... something. I don't really know what to call him. We definitely weren't boyfriends. We just sort of dated, sort of... What do you call someone who's like that? Fun-buddy. Why am I nervous? I didn't do anything wrong. Rusty was the one who tried to hook me up with an ex fun-buddy. But see, I just left. He got out of there, and I came to apologize for that. Because that was wrong. That was very wrong. This is the guy you want me to be friends with? Neither of us are interested. - Just give it a rest, Calvin. - Girlfriend on the rag, Owens? I'm his boyfriend, J.P. Grant, he was just messing around, OK? Your boyfriend's super cute. I don't know how I'd feel about him playing with a sorority full of mostly single, attractive quality girls like Gamma Psi. I just hope the fact that ZBZ is playing with Omega Chi doesn't harm your relationship. Good luck tomorrow! Gamma Psi's playing with the Kts? How'd that happen? - They asked us. - And how'd that happen? They waited so long, KT and Psi Phi Pi were the only houses left. Apparently, our desire to crush the Omega Chi's gave us the edge. With ZBZ as collateral damage, that is. She gave me the schedule, and apparently KT and ZBZ will be playing together, after all. - Except on opposing teams. - You're going down. - KT, I'm so glad you could join us. - We're glad to be here. That was sarcasm. You're late for warm-ups. - You were serious about warm-ups? - I'm always serious. She is. Teammate! Captains' meeting at home plate. Neat whistle. And your practice looks very militant. I never thought you'd be so gung-ho about a softball tournament. I might be beyond sorority politics but I am gung-ho about winning. Ladies, don't make me call your mothers! Play ball! Get it, get it, get it! Pledges! I got a hit. - Congratulations. - Really awesome, Mr. Spitter. Will you put down the cards and show some KT pride? Look! You should be cheering. You should be running. Atta boy now! - Safe! - Are you blind, ump?! He was out! Are you crazy? He was out! What are you doing?! Are you an idiot? - What are you talking about? - He was out! He clearly plopped on home plate. How was he safe? - The ump's on the take! - What did he take? Guys! We'll get the next one, all right? - He was out! - Aww, man! This is so gay! Really, Trip? What was gay about it? I didn't mean it like that. I just meant it was a lame call. - Maybe this isn't the time. - I just want to make sure he understands those two words mean completely different things. - Dude, don't be so touchy. - Just drop the gay stuff, OK? - He's right. It's not cool. - Shut up, douche. You touch the douche, and we're out, OK? Can you get thrown out of a game for fighting with your own team? Yeah. Break it up! Everyone back on the field! Will you just chill out? Play ball! All right, let's go, team! Let's take these losers out! - Yeah, good one... - Who wants some?! Come on, Cap! Hit a double play! Come on, Cappie! Batter, batter, batter, batter, batter! That was overhand! - Time! - Time out! What? What the hell? You could've really hurt him. It was an accident. Be more careful. This is a friendly game. Like you and the Gamma Psi's? Wait. Can I ask you something? Were we in love? What? Is that why you nearly took off his head? - Are you still...? - No! This isn't about us. I'm dating Rebecca. We've gone out, like, twice. But she said she doesn't believe in love. - Any day now! - And I can't believe that we're talking about this here, now. You've gone out twice. Relax. OK? Are you talking about me and Evan? I'm bored. Nothing happens out there. And he's cute. - Call him over, I want to meet him. - Guys, we're in the middle of a game! - But what does it matter if... - What's his name? Play ball! Relax. Don't mess with people's emotions. There will be time to flirt when we're not in an inning. Now everyone get back to your positions. And strike out my boyfriend. Come on, Cap! Hit a grand slam! The bases aren't loaded, but thank you! - Come on, Cappie! - Come on, play ball! You OK? I'm fine. Just hope my lungs don't explode. Did you see that line drive? - Payback's a bitch? - His was an accident. I think. So was mine. You think my aim's that good? And you're defending him now? I see where your loyalties are. On this field, I am first and foremost a ZBZ - with Cappie's girlfriend a close second. - Ouch, by the way. - I'd put you above winning. - Yeah, that's easy for you to say. I'll prove it to you. I will lob you easy pitches. You can stare'em down and let me strike you out or you can swing away. Or you could walk me. I want to beat the Gamma Psi's just as bad as you want to beat the Omega Chi's. Good point. We'll have to wait and see what happens. You're just... Seriously, though, the Omega Chi's got three of my brothers expelled. I've never wanted to win more in my life. Although, you can't win just by getting on base, know what I mean? All you have to do is get on base. - No pressure? - All right. - Let's go, Casey! - "And then, responding to the cheers, she lightly doffed her hat. No stranger in the crowd could doubt - it was Casey at the bat." - Rusty, I am trying to concentrate. I memorized that poem in, like, fourth grade. Strike one! Come on, Zeta Beta! Throw the heat! Strike two! One more, Cappie! - Time! Time! - Time out! My foot fell asleep. Rusty, can I talk to you? Come here. I am no doctor. Try noving it around a little. Get the blood flowing. It's not my foot. It's Cappie. Should I throw the game for him, or make a hit so ZBZ can win? Because we really need the Blue Ribbon points. Then try to get a hit out there. You're playing for ZBZ. Although, I could understand putting a personal relationship above house feuds. - That doesn't help me at all. - What do you want me to say? - Play ball! - Go, Casey! Come on, one more, Cap! I told you we should have gone with the Psi Phi Pi's. Well, congrats on your win. I would say a full "congratulations" but I removed the second half of the word for your Omega Chi teammates. I refuse to offer them any "ulations." Thanks. And thanks for throwing me easy pitches. It was slow-pitch. You were supposed - to strike out for me. - I'm sorry ! You wanted to beat the OC, but we... needed the Blue Ribbon points to help us get back to number one. - And I like to win. - Really ? Because we're in a relationship doesn't mean I'm gonna stop trying. It wasn't just about Blue Ribbon points ? You think I'm too competitive ? It's one of the things I love most about you. - Hi. - Hey Casey. Is Ashleigh in attendance ? I wish to apologize for my inappropriate advances the other night. And... it would please me very much to escort her to dinner and a movie. Appropriately. I saw her a second ago... there she is. How you doing ? He'll be fine. What's up ? Can you believe that back there ? I just wish Grant would chill sometimes. I don't know. I may not like Grant for my own personal reasons, but I think he was right to tell that guy off. He was standing up for himself. I think you should, too. Are you trying to tell me how to be gay ? - Because you don't know what it's like. - I know. You're right. I was made fun of in high school and I never stood up for myself. I wish I did. I wish I was more like Grant back then. Good game. Thanks. And thanks for the support on the whole "that's so gay" thing. I am sorry. All right ? Yes, it offends me, too. When you stand up like that, you make our whole relationship this huge political statement. And it doesn't have to be like that. Times have changed. It's not like it was 50 years ago. You're right. Times are changing, but they haven't changed. I wasn't ready to come out of the closet for a reason. I do think it's my responsibility to stand up for myself, because I want to be proud of who I am. And not allow other people to make me feel bad about it. See ? I told you he was great. Grant Ellis. Educating straight people since... last week. You look pretty hot in uniform. You look pretty hot in anything. Why'd you guys choose us over the Gamma Psi's ? - Aren't they the number one house ? - Well... I might have done some lobbying on ZBZ's behalf, for... personal reasons. About our conversation the other night. Right. Don't even worry about that. Because all I want to know now, is "when's our next date" ? Guys ! So, Pete just had a great idea. He thinks the four of us should go out on a double-date next weekend. What do you think ? Yes ! A double-date next week. Neat. - What do you think, Evan ? - I think it's a great idea. I'm glad you're spending the night here tonight. We have so much gossip to catch up on, I don't even know where to start. - Cappie and I... - Wait ! Yes, I do. The cute Omega Chi playing left-base asked me out ! I know. You've told me about 20 times. Did I mention that Beaver was looking for you at Dobler's ? Are you trying to ruin my new boy buzz ? No, I just miss you. Now you're double-dating with Evan and Rebecca - instead of me and Cappie. - Well... Maybe by the time I marry Pete, the KT-Omega Chi feud will be over. And Cappie can even be in the wedding party. I almost let Cappie talk me out of winning today. - Someone found the "I" in team. - No. I meant, us. ZBZ. And for a second there, I was considering striking out for him. Should I have ? When am I supposed to compromise what I want for a relationship ? This is going to be trickier than I thought. I saw you talking to Calvin at Dobler's. How's all that going ? Well... I tried to tolerate Grant, like you said. But it didn't work out. - Too much of a jerk ? - Yeah. But not him. I was the jerk. I couldn't see past the fact that he's an Omega Chi. But today... - I saw a side of him I liked. - The side that looks like Heath ? I'm not saying we're best friends or anything like that, but it's a start. - Sorry I'm late. - Dumptruck ? - Where's your pledge pin ? - Right here. Chill. - Take it off your pants. - Take off my pants ? Take the pin off your pants and put it on your shirt, where it's supposed to be. It's your responsibility to be proud of who you are. That pin is a symbol of KT pride and tradition. And The second you stop respecting that, then someone else does... then someone else does... then it means nothing anymore. Now get back in there and join your brothers. Let's get this show on the road. - Go Pledge Educator Spitter. - Yep. Rusty Cartwright. Educating KT pledges since... right now. Up top. - What movie are we watching ? - The best baseball movie ever. Field of Dreams ? - Bull Durham ? - The Natural ? A League of Their Own. I love this movie so much. There's no crying in baseball. Fade in. The year is 1943 in Rockford, Illinois, And World War II has threatened
