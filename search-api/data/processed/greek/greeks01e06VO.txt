You're senator Logan's daughter! You didn't mention you knew her. Should've known my brother would volunteer. - Way to take one for the team. - Pledging's about sacrifice. - That is impressive. - Thanks, big sis. But if you really want to win, you have to be willing to play dirty. Right, Becs? - Who sent it? - I bet it's from Rebecca. She didn't do this. - Someone else's holding the camera. - Where's Rusty? - What's the big emergency? - Lisa Lawson, Cap? She's even easier to get into bed than you are. Really? Damn it, I'm losing my edge. Hey, Rusty. Remember me? Jen K. Crushed baskets. Yeah. Did you ever think that you might have an unsecret admirer? Do you like me? Spitter, spitter, spitter! Calm down, Jamie Lee. - It's just me. - I know. That nail polish is super scary. You serious? I have a crucial question to ask you. Do these need more rhinestones? Ash! They're puffy paint perfection. The pledges are gonna flip. I know, right? I don't get why you're going through trouble. We didn't have a slumber party when we were pledges. It's simple: Today's pledges are tomorrow's voters. Wow, you said obama was cute, but this campaign event seems extreme. For Zeta Beta president, you dork. With Frannie and the rest of the house away at the Indiana game, it's the perfect opportunity for me to impress the girls. There are a ton of fun exercises in my pledge educator handbook. After tonight, the girls will be bonded to each other, to Zeta Beta, and, most of all, to me. - They must be so excited. - Oh, that's the best part. I told them to pack for a mystery location. I can't wait to surprise them. We missed an away game to spend the night in the living room? Girls, tonight is about sisterhood. It's about all of us taking the time to connect on a deeper level. By morning, we'll truly be sisters. Now, who's up for a trust fall? A thunderstorm watch is in effect... Okay, so... I finished mopping the floors. Cleaned the bathrooms. Anything else? Yeah, just one more thing. It's time to repaint the kitchen. It's Friday night. Everyone else is out of town at the game. Oh, poor pledge Owens. I drew the short stick and got house duty too, but you don't see me getting all teary. Now, come on. If I'm here, than my little bro is here. All right, where's the paint? I'm screwing with you! Come on. Plant a cheek, let's hang out for a bit. Huh, well, actually... What? You got some place you'd rather be? No. No. No, this is... Great. - Wanna watch TV? - Love TV! Damn! - Looks like we got a mouse. - That sucks. You know what sucks is you pledges still don't know how to clean. Coming up next, Alien. Hey, check it out, Alien. Why the long face? This party's got your three favorite things: Beer, girls, and a severe weather warning. I'm in a funk, spitter. Come on! Look at all the hot mommas here. I'm currently off the market because I'm in a relationship. But if I didn't have a girlfriend, I'd be all over this. Subtle. What about her? We call her "saran wrap." Clingy. - She's pretty. - Her perfume gives me hives. Cappie. What could be wrong with her? - Sleep apnea. - You are in a funk. Yeah, I just feel like I'm watching tv and all that's on is reruns. You know? Maybe I just need a furlough from the females. I could spend some time indulging my other interests like beer and "Days of Our Lives". And mentoring today's youth. Speaking of which, Tell me about this girlfriend of yours. Well, her name is Jen K. And she has these soft, fluffy, pink lips that I could kiss forever. Hold that thought. My Harley popped a flat down the road. Can I come in? Dear God, yes. Transcript: swsub.com GREEK 106 "Friday Night Frights" Synchro: Flolo, Kasius Okay, everyone has a partner? Best Friday night ever, right? Way better than reruns of "Ghost Whisperer". Can't believe we've been pledge sisters for six weeks but we've barely even spoken. It boggles the mind. This about trusting that your sisters will always be there for you. That they will catch you when you fall. And trusting that they won't be skanky sluts who sleep with your boyfriend. So when you're ready fall back and feel the support of the Zeta Beta sisterhood. - Oh, ouija board! - Oh! Oh, my God! Are you okay? Mm, brain pain. - Who wants to go first? - Oh, I do! We'll have plenty of time later once we get through my agenda of team building activities. Casey, this corporate retreat has been a non-stop fun fest. But what better way to learn about the Zeta Beta legacy than by talking to some old, dead sisters? Yeah! That is, unless you're scared. Rebecca, you should know that I'm not scared of things that are evil. Prove it. Fine, and then we can move on. Is anyone there? Looks like nobody's home. They must be at the football game. Look! A spirit moves among us. Please. Rebecca totally moved it. Spirit, tell us who you are. V... i... r... g... i... n... "Virgin." I stand corrected. It's not Rebecca. Now back to bonding. How about some pledge trivia? Or we could tell ghost stories. Yeah. Welcome to Kappa Tau. I'm Cappie, your humble servant. Cappie, huh? - Cute. - So I've been told. And, uh, and... and you are? Destiny. Exotic, cosmic. Me likey. These are other people. May I take your jacket? Fine. - Destiny, you are... - Thirsty. - Pour me a drink? - What would you like? Something with a bite to it. I'll get you something you can sink your teeth into. - So should we call someone? - Why? To fix your bike. Oh, right. I'll let the storm blow over. Are you a student? You ask a lot of questions. Do I need to have my lawyer present? Kidding. You learn to ask that in prison. Kidding. She's odd. Yeah. Oddly hot. Let me guess. It's from my brother. My, oh, my, isn't he Captain Romance. How's the head wound? I'm not showing any signs of concussion, so I should be okay. - Are you pre-med? - No, just clumsy. I see. So I guess this proves Rebecca Logan can't be trusted. That was proven long ago. - Via text message. - Exactly. Wait a second. How'd you know about that video? - I sent it to you. - What? Rebecca and I were in the same rush group. I had a front row seat that night for her little indiscretion. I thought you deserved to know about it. - That video was really painful to watch. - So I shouldn't have sent it. No. No, I'm glad you did. In a weird way, it helped me process and purge. I can't believe you were the cell phone Scorsese. Scorsese? You think? I thought the framing was a little off, especially towards the end. I'm sorry. Sometimes I misinterpret snappy banter. Just know that I was only trying to help. No matter what, there's always one pledge who's on your side. - Thanks, Jen K. - Oh, I didn't mean me. I was talking about Mandy. Funny. You're really funny. I can see why my brother's so into you. Legend has it the ghost was a spirit of an old student who was the golden girl on campus. Class president, prom queen, all that crap. But she'd suffered a horrible humiliation. I heard it was some sort of sex scandal. Anyway, she became the laughing stock of the entire school. And the humiliation... made her snap! She took a razor blade and slashed the throats of the most popular girls at school. Then she arranged the bodies in an elaborate fake slumber party. And that's how they found her. Covered in blood, pretending she had friends. Dobler's is closed! Can you freakin' believe it? - Perhaps because of the tornado watch? - So? It's Karaoke Friday. Their loss. I was gonna do my reggae version of "Lady Marmalade." Ash, Rebecca is totally hijacking my slumber party. She's in there telling ghost stories. Help me get control back. No problem. Let me handle this. Everyone listen up. Did you know that a Z. B.Z. died in this house? Ash. Her name was Virginia. I bet that was what the ouija board was spelling. Yeah. See? Told ya. Ah, man! She was just about to blow it out the airlock! - Thanks. - What? - Now I know how it ends. - I'm sorry. Gotcha. Who's easy now? I've seen that movie, like, 87 times. Cell phones are out too. What can two guys do alone in the dark? How about we catch that mouse? - Great idea. - Yeah. Did you arrange this lighting? Well, I do look best in candlelight. And how do I look? You look... familiar. Let me guess. You've seen me in your dreams. Come on, Cappie. Is that the best you've got? I love your smile. I just want to put it in my pocket. I love your eyes. I wanna gouge them out and wear them on a chain around my neck. You're a little bit twisted. Refreshing. Cap, can I borrow a candle? I'm gonna look for some flashlights. ...knocked out power lines throughout the area. Everyone is advised to stay inside. She came here on purpose. Hold the hysteria, everyone. It's just a storm. - Or is it Virginia? - There is no Virginia. - Right, Ash? - Then... why did they make this? What is that doing there? Frannie hung it there. She said it was too depressing for daily viewing. I wonder how she died. She was probably murdered... by a serial killer... who ate her. Please... I'm sure she died of something boring, like cancer. And, ash, we don't know that she died in the house. If only we could Google her. Ah, but we can't. Moving on. How about we all gather 'round for a sharing circle? - We could use these! - Oh, right... books... Duh. Light, spitter. - Spitter, cut it out. - Sorry. - Wade, have you seen Cappie? - No. That girl Cappie's with has been lying to us. She said she came across this house by accident, but I found our address in her purse. What should we do? Wade, you there? Okay, Alien versus Aliens. Discuss. What's there to discuss? Alien. Sigourney Weaver. Uh, Ridley Scott. It's in a different league. Yeah, I don't know, though. I don't know. I mean, Aliens had James Cameron. And Paul Reiser. Paul Reiser? You call that an argument? No, Alien is a classic. Like Jaws. Uh, please don't... don't bring up Jaws. My sister died in a shark attack. Yeah, right. No, it's true. It was two summers ago. We were taking surfing lessons in Hawaii. She'd just caught her first wave. I'll never forget the smile on her face. Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, a fin appeared. Oh, my God. Yeah. We screamed for her to paddle, but it was too late. The shark attacked. She screamed. I can't believe you're buying this, Calvin. Oh, you jackass! No, no... I don't even have a sister. Only brothers, and an addiction to horror movies. - Oh, same here. - Really? Oh, yeah. When I was a kid, my parents would only let me watch PBS. Yeah. And then late at night, I would sneak downstairs and stay up all night watching horror movies. Yeah, watching two inches away from the screen, keep the volume really low. - Totally, which made it even scarier. - I know! Plus in those 1980s slasher movies, there's always a hot girl flashing her boobs. Yeah. You hear that? - Evan. - What? It's right behind you. - Yeah, you'll pay for that, Owens. - That's for your dead sister. - Ahh! - What? I think I'm gonna need a bigger spatula. Cappie? Manly scream you got there. Yeah, well... you surprised me. - Have you seen Cappie? - I'm not his mother. - The bathroom this way? - Yeah. Destiny, wait. Why are you here? Someone needs to work on their listening. I told you. My bike broke down. How do you explain this? - Where did you get that? - Never mind that. I'm on to you. Nice one, Spitter. Who are you? Sydney Bristow? Okay, listen... I came here to see Cappie. You know him? We went to camp Kitchi-Wa-Wa together ten years ago. Why didn't you just say so? God, this is so embarrassing. My real name isn't Destiny. It's Patty. Back in camp, I was the fat girl. Total outcast. Cappie was the only thing that made it worthwhile. I has such a crush on him. But he was part of the cool crowd. So I promised myself that one day I'd make him notice me. You chose tonight? Well, I drove up from West Virginia. Just my luck there's a freakin' hurricane outside. Let's get Cappie and tell him. No! No, this is our little secret. If you tell Cappie, it'll ruin our moment. He deserves to know who you really are. This is who I really am. Are you the same person you were back then? No, I'm not. See? I swear I'll tell him eventually. Cool? Fine. Could you please release your kung fu grip? This is me being gentle. If I wanted to, I could snap it like a twig. I'm real glad we had this chat. I found her! Oh, my God. She's wearing the "rachel." Hello! Hair cliché! It says here that she was pledge educator. Just like you, Casey. Really? I wonder if she planned a slumber party. In fact, she ran for president. But according to these minutes, she lost by one vote... to Trudy Henderson. Oh, my gosh. What? The election was the day she died. You guys, I found out how Virginia croaked. She hung herself from the chandelier. She must've been really depressed about losing the election. How sad. Sad? It's pathetic. Who makes that big of a deal about a stupid sorority election? You are hypnotizing me with those hips, aren't you? Go ahead. Try and pinch an inch. You can't, can you? You're perfect. I'm perfect for you. I couldn't agree more. Cappie, you gotta come quick. What is it, Lassie? Is the barn burning down? Yeah, can't you see we're kind of busy? It's Beaver. He's drunk. And he's peeing in your closet. Not again. All right, stay here. I'll be right back. Well, they're urine-free. You must've given him stage fright. Cap, we don't have much time. That's why we should live in the moment. No, I mean until Destiny finds us. She's not who you think she is. - She's not a hot girl? - No, she is... Then she's exactly who I think she is. But you know her! She went to camp with you. What? Listen, I might die for telling you this, but her name isn't Destiny. - It's Patty. - Patty... from camp. The only patty there was Patty the Fatty. Oh, my God... she's Patty the Fatty. What are the odds that she'd get a flat tire outside of our house? Oh, my God. She came to see me. She's always had a crush on you. She spent the past ten years getting in shape so you two could have a second chance. That is really... - Insane? What? - Hot! A fat girl turned into a hot chick for me? It's like a Reese Witherspoon movie. She went through all that trouble just to get into shape. The least I can do is reward her for her effort, right? But she sounds crazy. Crazy like a fox. A super fox in leather, to be specific. I'm flattered. You need to relax. Listen, no... Cap. I think she's dangerous. She's really strong. She's got these crazy eyes. You're really mowing that grassy knoll, huh? I think I can handle her, Spitter. Breathe, girls. In through the nose, out through the mouth. This is all because of the storm. The storm entered the house and knocked down the chandelier? The chandelier is older than Madonna. We've been trying to get an electrician in here for weeks to secure it. The wind made the house vibrate which was enough to make it fall. But Casey, I saw the electrician in here last week. - That's not possible. - This has got to be Virginia. She is one pissed poltergeist. You're freaking the girls out. Good, then it's working. - What the hell is your problem? - Listen, these girls might buy your slumber party bonding crap, but I see right through it. You just want their votes. - That's not true. - It's good politics. I'm actually impressed. - Then why are you sabotaging it? - Well... first, there's the whole arch nemesis thing. But also, I feel my pledge sisters deserve to see how their future leader reacts in a crisis. Wait, everyone shut up. I know how to fix this. We need to have a seance. Great idea! See anything? Not yet. It's too fat to have gone far. 3:00. All right, begin Operation Rodent round up. Dinner time, Mr. Rat. On three. - Ready? - Ready. One... Two... What the hell was that? Watcha watching? Freaky, delusional romance that could have deadly consequences. So do you know how to work this thingy? Wondering when the cell service is gonna be back. Cool. It's like magic. Actually it's a simple crank generator that turns friction into electricity. Or magic! This just in. Officials at Stoneybrook mental institution report</i> that one of their patients escaped during the storm.</i> She's described as a caucasian woman, 5'8"...</i> ... years old. Listeners are warned to avoid contact since the woman is considered unstable and extremely dangerous.</i> Scary. You have no idea. - We're ready. - This is ridiculous, Ash. Trust me. I had a goth phase in middle school. This seance will work. Yeah, Casey, we've got to see this through. Virginia' spirit's trying to tell us something. Probably that there's no such thing as ghosts. We all must be quiet and relaxed. Everyone, close your eyes and hold hands. and hold hands. Clammy. Virginia Horton, the sisters of Zeta Beta Zeta invite you to commune with us. Maybe she has her cell phone turned off. Sorry, you were possessed. Her spirit passed through me. She's here. Ashleigh, could you ask the ghost what she wants so we can move on? Virginia, tell us what you want. I bet she wants us to get back to bonding. You guys, it's just the wind. I'm not so sure. What do you think that was back there? No idea. I'm just... hoping it doesn't bleed acid. Don't worry, little bro. I'll protect you. Why do you think I need protecting? You seemed a little scared, that's all. Me? No, I've faced some pretty vicious animals in my day. See that? My little sister's bunny, Flopsie, took a chunk out of it. I need four stitches and a tetanus shot. That's nothing. Petting zoo, 1998. Got attacked by a rogue goat. Six stitches and they closed the zoo for a week. Paper route, eighth grade, rabid poodle attack, 12 stitches and I passed out. Poodle? Try a polo horse. Fell off one four years ago, got a concussion and a CAT Scan. Head trauma, huh? - Explains a lot. - What? It's on the move. Guys, there's no such thing as ghosts. Right, Ashleigh? You can never be too safe. Casey, tell them they're being ridiculous. Well, you did call Virginia pathetic. - Everyone heard you. - But I was kidding! I was kidding! It was just a joke! Loose brick. Look. The ghost is writing us notes. Virginia's such a pretty name. I don't think these are notes. I think these are votes. Then that can only mean one thing. Someone fixed the election. The minutes said that Virginia lost by one vote. But if these were counted, she would've won. know what we have to do. - All clear. - Sweep the room. We really make a good team. Like Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. To think I thought we wouldn't get along. - Really? - You know, you're... you know. I'm what? You're pals with Rusty. Him and I aren't exactly<i> amigos.</i> Yeah, I know. I was there for Paddlegate. It's cool you can see beyond that, man. Well, you know, I just, try to stay out of other people's business. I do. And I respect that. You know how many people want in my business just because I'm a Chambers? Yeah, it's crazy how... one little word can define you. Totally. Evan, there's something I think you should know. What is it? Giant snake! Above you! Nice try... Get away from him, you bitch! Get it off me! Counter-clockwise! I really need to talk to you. Dude, give me a second. It's just number one. The bathroom is that way, Beave! Why do you keep moving it? What the hell? Do you like my art project? I can see you're influenced by the deconstructionist movement. Sit down. We're not done. I'm really good at arts and crafts. I can see that. This is what I did every day at camp. Alone, while everybody else played kickball and rode horses. Well, creativity is a much more transferable skill. I'd imagine this was me and Cappie holding hands for eternity. I can see the resemblance. Now I kind of picture this as us and all our friends. Look... this is you. - Listen, Patty... - Destiny! Destiny. I know what it's like to want to go back and revise history. I wasn't always this cool frat guy you see before you. This can't change the past. You can't make someone love you. Yes, I can! Tonight is going to be perfect, you'll see. Because I have waited too long to let anything mess this up. Or anyone. - You remembered me. - Of course... from the moment you walked in. How could I ever forget the way the water glistened off your wonder woman bathing suit. You didn't stand up for me. You let them call me names. I know, and that was wrong. I was young and stupid. Do you have any idea what it's like to love someone who's caused you so much pain? Cappie, look out! That's it? Excuse me? I lost 80 pounds for that? I've never had any complaints before. Let me just try a better angle. No, that's okay. Listen, it's been fun, but... I really need a donut. Stay in touch. Sisters of Zeta Beta Zeta, this election is called to order. Our president is the person who shapes the future of our sisterhood. It is a role that requires vision, tenacity, and grace. So choose wisely. We have two candidates this evening. Virginia Horton and... What's that chick's name? - Trudy Henderson. - Trudy Henderson. Would anyone like to make a supporting statement for either candidate? I'd just like to say that Virginia seems like the clear choice. She's by far the skinniest, prettiest, most worthy candidate. She's definitely not pathetic... in any way. Thank you, pledge Logan. Let's get on with the voting. All in favor of Virginia Horton raise your hand. Well, it looks like... - Wait, hold on. I'm not done counting. - It looks unanimous. Virginia Horton wins. Congratulations, Virginia. This is election is adjourned. Now what? Now we can get on with our evening. Do you think it worked? Apparently so. Let's hear it for Casey, everybody. Now who's up for some ice cream? It looks like you owe Casey your life. The exterminator's gonna be here in two hours. Two hours? Okay, I think we can make it 'til then. What do we tell the guys? I say we never speak of this again. Everybody's got their secrets, right? Right. In other news, police have apprehended the escaped mental patient.</i> Officials say that luckily the 60-year-old woman had a bad hip</i> and was unable to travel far. Could I be a bad kisser? It's like having a dangling booger. Someone would tell me, right? Cap, you can't listen to what she said. She was crazy, after all. She wasn't crazy, she was in love. It's a fine line between the two. She drove here from West Virginia to find you. She went after what she wants. You have to admire that. But what did it get her? Closure. Now she can move on. Guys, look who I found outside. Hey, Timmy! I'm so glad that I found you. Who's my buddy? Who's my buddy? - What's up with the redecorating? - Just putting Virginia back where she belongs. After tonight, she deserves to be up there. Yeah, funny thing about tonight... what a coincidence that these votes were hidden in the fireplace. I know, right? And what's more impressive is one of them's in Casey's handwriting.
