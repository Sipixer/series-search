I'm thinking about going back to law school - That's great. - I brought it up with Cap. You have to live your own life. You have to go after what you want - and not worry about him. - I'm not ready to graduate. - What about you and Casey ? - If she gets into CRU Law, - it won't be an issue. - If she doesn't ? - I don't know. - I'm sorry I tried to change you. - What about graduation ? - We'll worry about that in May. Dana inspires me. Do you need to talk to me about anything else ? I've been thinking. I enjoy our time together, but I don't want to hide it. No. Sorry. Why won't you tell me your plan ? - There isn't one. - I could help you. But I also know if I have a problem, I can come to you. I wish you felt the same. Ladies and gentlemen, as president, it is my job to nominate the one man who can lead us to victory. And our new Revenge Chair : Rusty Cartwright ! Phase one is complete. Phase Two : Myrtle Beach. After years of pranks and brawls and pledge paddles, this is it. Revenge on Omega Chi has never looked so sweet. And fun ! The first phase of Mission : Probable is complete. The next three are ready and waiting in Myrtle Beach. You might have to do some of this without me. I have a secret mission of my own involving your sister. And put Evan Chambers down. What are you doing ? Are you talking about Casey's birthday ? I thought you were cc'ed on her gift wish list. No, I'm pretty sure this is something she won't be expecting. No way ! Wait, is that the same lavaliere that Beaver... Don't ask questions. You don't want to know. This is Casey's last spring break. I'm gonna get this right. Find the perfect moment. You know, if this works, we're never gonna have to worry about the Omega Chis again. That's the plan. Mini-car ! You're going down, little Omega Chi pony ! B Team, rappel ! Boot stomps ! That makes my sixth interview this week ! After graduation, I'm just gonna have to live off the land. Whatever that means. - It went well ? - If you ask me what my weaknesses are, I'm gonna tell you ! Punctuality's overrated anyway. Fortunately, we have Spring Break to delight and maybe even surprise us. And take our minds off of all this post-grad craziness. By post-grad craziness, are you referring to the fact that you're both insanely checking your e-mail for law school responses ? So far I've been rejected from Stanford, Georgetown and Texas. I feel like Laura at a mixer. - You still have George Washington... - And CRU. I just want to know already. You know, we did get some mail earlier today. What ? Where is it ? Where is it at ? They say you can tell a lot about whether you were accepted or not by the size of the envelope. I can't look ! - Like what they say about guys' feet. - That's a myth ! Where's the damn mail ? It's big. It's big. It's really big. Read it. Open it ! My God, I got into GW Law School in Washington, DC ! - That's awesome ! - I know ! My God. This is really happening. Yeah, it's happening. And you know they really did admit you because George Washington University cannot tell a lie. Ash, did you get any mail from CRU ? Not yet, right ? Right. - = 320 =- "All Children... Grow Up" Kappa Team And since the KTs were gracious enough to suck at golf last week, I'm proud to say we have a sic party house in Myrtle Beach ! It's on the Strand, wet bar, hot tub. It's gonna be awesome ! All right, but not too awesome, guys. I got a letter from Nationals, they're seriously cracking down this year. "Given several incidents involving illegal or untoward behavior "by some chapters last spring break, "members involved in any illegal activity will risk immediate suspension and the revocation of their charter". Well, there goes our South Carolinian prostitution ring. All right, next up, house elections are after we return from spring break, so I'll now open the floor to presidential nominations. JP ? I nominate Trip Sutcliffe. Well, I graciously and humbly accept this nomination. I would like to nominate Calvin Owens. Me ? Shocker. Even though we broke up, I still appreciate his integrity and I would love to see him lead this house. Thanks, Grant. Great. Any other nominations ? All right, then campaign season will commence after Spring Break for Sutcliffe versus Owens. Meeting adjourned. - So that was pretty cool of Grant ? - Yeah, I'm glad to see you guys are staying friends. - I'm not sure he did you a favor. - What do you mean ? You know what I've been through with this house, these guys. How much of a jerk I've had to be. I'm just no sure this is a job you're wired to handle. Or even really want. I've never been to Myrtle Beach before. It's so great. There's this club, Paradox. Are they gonna stamp our hands or give us one of those wristband things ? I couldn't get in. But the beach is so great. Provided you wear sun block, which I didn't. Sounds... dangerous. Well, the truth is, I was actually only there for one night. I ended up coming back with Calvin and Dale. See, Calvin and I were kind of in a fight because of the feud between our houses. Your houses sure fight a lot. Well, this Spring Break's going to be different. There are a few things I have to do for KT while I'm there, but outside of that, it's gonna be all Dana-Rusty, all the time. I can't wait. I was lucky to get a room so last minute. Well... I know we've only been going out a couple of weeks. And the way the economy is... We could share a room. To save money. Only if you want ! Because of the economy. And stuff. I wouldn't mind... saving a little money. That's great ! Because the economy sucks, so... we can be frugal. Together. Yes, sir. I completely see the irony of asking you to do something illegal regarding admissions to a school that teaches the law, but if I did get into CRU Law, could you just like cough or sniff or something ? One cough yes, two coughs no ? Hello ? Stupid laws. I have some good news. I just got off the phone with Nationals and next year they're requiring all houses employ a full-time house mother. - How's that good news ? - I meant for us, because we're graduating. I wish I was graduating. Trust me, little sis, you don't. Where are we on Casey's surprise birthday party ? We're set ! I reserved a section at Tijuana Tony's. Big banner, lots of balloons, pink ones. And make sure they have a lemon drop waiting for her. Then keep them coming. What ? Casey's as predictable as a Katherine Heigl movie. So what's all this graduation talk ? Just the thought of going to spring break single ? - It's kinda sad. - And kinda my second year doing it. - Sorry. - No, don't be. We can find fun new guys together ! I'm kinda missing my lame old one. We need to shake this Evan Chambers thing. You know what we could do ? We could take a vacation from ourselves. Can we go somewhere better than Myrtle Beach ? No, but we can lie about who we are. I used to do it all the time on family vacations. On one trip to San Francisco, I told this waiter I was a teen prodigy in town to play the cello for Tony Blair and Oprah. And I got free dessert. It was awesome. Trust me. Hey, you heading back down to Sin in the Sand Land ? Yeah. I thought you were going turkey-hunting again. I thought I'd do something different. Hang out by the pool, get some sun. It's too bad you don't want to go to Sin in the Sand Land. I wouldn't say no. You just called it "Sin in the Sand Land." - Why would you want to go ? - For the sand. If I were invited. My room is going to be occupied. But I do know someone else who has an extra room. - I can call her and see if... - Is that an invitation ? Do you want to go to Myrtle Beach with me and Dana ? - Dana's going ? - I'm sure she won't mind. No, I just find her really grating. Let me think about it. All right, I'll pack my floaties. You're wasting valuable party time, Case ! Let's go ! Hold on, guys. Hi... do you have any mail for Casey Cartwright ? I'm her. I mean, I'm she. She's me. I'm me. Hi. Hi. I can't deliver mail to strangers. You're going to have to wait until I get to your house. This might be my last spring break with my boyfriend. Because we're going down two different life paths. I get into CRU Law School. Law school ? So you know it's illegal... Irony, got it. Regardless, if I get into CRU, that'd buy us a few more years. If I don't, I've to accept this is a college thing and we'll have to go our separate ways. - I deliver mail for a living. - I'll pay you. Also illegal. You know what ? Never mind, here. I'll give you a trick of the trade. You can tell whether you were accepted or not by the size of the envelope. CRU Law, right ? Sorry. Thanks. - Anything from CRU ? - Just this underwear catalog. - Can I have it ? - We've talked about this, Beav. This is gonna be a spring break you'll never forget. I think so. It's as God-awful as I'd imagined. You know, Dale, I really wish I hadn't canceled that room. I don't mind staying with you two. There's gotta be a Hide-A-Bed or something. Where's it hiding ? Sorry, Dana. It's okay. I just thought we were gonna... save a little money. We are. We're doing this three ways. No ! Not in the way you're thinking. But there can still be some savings. We can save some money elsewhere. I brought coupons, for your pleasure. Stone Phillips says a black light is the best way to check for residual... protein matter. There it is. Looks like someone saved money all over the room. On the phone ? I call the floor. Guess we get the bed. Did you guys see the hot tub out back ? This place is better than the house on Jersey Shore. And with fewer hair-gelled fame-whores. I can't believe we lucked out with this place. I can't believe the KTs lucked into this place. What the hell are you doing here ? This is my boss's house. - There's been a misunderstanding. - No, freaking kidding ! This is our house. We rented it for the week. No, these guys we know rented it. What are you, stupid or something ? You got exactly ten seconds to get off this property. Or what ? Sir, we apologize to you. And we don't want any trouble so we will be leaving now. Take these items, please, as a gift, and... Sorry. It's a set-up. Kappa Taus wanted us to win that tournament. - Well, now we're homeless. - Guess we kinda had it coming. Had it coming ? Let's serve it back. Let's find a place to stay first, Trip. Phase two is complete. So that's it. I guess I'm leaving Cyprus and... leaving Cappie. I'm sorry. But I thought you'd accepted your relationship with Cappie would end after graduation. I did, but that's when everything was... theoretical. - And now it's retical. - Exactly. I'm gonna be 22 ! Do you know who's 22 ? Old people. But do old people bungee jump ? Come on, it's our last spring break I'm not going to let you angst your way through it. I am gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you, too ! How could I not have gotten into CRU ? I mean, that was my safety school ! GW Law was sort of a long shot. You got into law school ? Congrats ! I went to Georgetown. Really ? Any advice ? Yeah. It's really hard. Don't flunk out. Who wants shots from the Margarito Bandito ? You want a shot ? God, yes ! Please ! Here ! My first fake ID. I can't believe it worked. - Thank you, "Chad Stewart." - Don't thank me, "Penelope Holmes." Thank Kappa Tau. What's the matter, "Francis Domingo" ? There's an awful lot of gratuitous flesh. It's like the CBS Evening News with Katie Couric. Well, I might try the bar. What should get ? "Sex on the Beach". "Sex in the Water". "Sex Wading in the Water but Planning to Come Back to the Beach." What do you think, Rusty ? Just get anything you want. With drink names like that, they're practically promoting unwanted pregnancies. You won't have to worry about that. - Now that I'm sharing the room. - Thanks, Francis. Thank you. I'm Taylor. I'm a dancer from Portland who loves pugs, moody floral prints and the music of Muse. And you are ? Julia. Well that's a start. Who are Julia and Taylor going to meet first ? I think you got one. I'm gonna go in for a closer look. I'm Taylor. I'm a dancer from Portland. I love your top. It seems leopard print's really making a comeback. OK... thanks. I have this friend who just broke up with his boyfriend. I could call him. Hi ? Sorry, cutie. This is just business. We come down here every year to observe trends, check out the young people. I like your look. I'm Faith Flowers. Well, Faith Flowers, let me be clear. I'm not interested in porn, or lifting my top or making out with a girl. Shame on you. Was that Faith Flowers ? I didn't know you watched porn. Faith Flowers is a trend forecaster. My father hired her as a consultant back in the day. Companies pay her to tell them what the latest trends are. That's a real job ? I'd be so good at that ! It's like being cool and psychic ! Do something about it. - What ? Beg her for a job ? - She's right there... Oh, no ! She was right there. It's like she's magic. She's the Fairy Job Mother. Look, we already have a hotel, all right ? So let's put everything behind us and have some fun. Hi, guys. How's the house ? We sure are pissed we lost it. That house belongs to someone else. Someone armed. And it's spring break, so we're stuck in a crap hotel. Sorry to hear about that, Cal. Thanks. Heath meant that sarcastically, by the way. When you guys are trying to sleep in your crappy hotel, I hope you dream of Jeremy, Ferret and Wade. You're still whining about that ? We didn't mean for them to get expelled. Then I didn't mean to sleep with your girlfriend, Bing. Wait, yes I did. Everyone remember what Nationals said. All right... Happy spring break, Evan Pompeo ! Of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> fame ! How's your first college spring break so far ? I never want to leave ! I heard about GW, that's so exciting ! - Yeah, really exciting. - Where are you going to live ? - I haven't thought about it. - Are you going to get a roommate ? - I'm not sure. - Do you even know anyone there ? No. You're probably not going to have a whole lot of time to socialize. I bet law school is super hard. Are you ready for it ? You know what ? I don't know. I'm not even 100 percent sure that I'm going. I mean... I could just stay in Cyprus for another year. Maybe take that housemother job at ZBZ. You should totally stay ! Right ? My parents say hi. They can't sleep at night knowing I'm down here. Their only comfort is knowing I'm below the Mason-Dixon line. So what should we do today ? You could do your own thing today. But I'm not sure how much fun I can have alone on a plantation tour. Why don't you come with me ? Dana and I had kinda had some romantic time planned. What's more romantic than taking in the architectural detail of two-century-old slaves' quarters ? I read online that girls love them. I appreciate you coming all this way because you wanted to spend time - with me. - I didn't come for you. Do you think I enjoy being your third wheel ? Then why are you here ? Forget it, have fun with your girlfriend. Is Francis okay ? I have no idea. You know, we're alone. Do you want to save some money ? Crap ! I've got this KT stuff I gotta do. It's Phase Three, I'll be right back. I will wait here. Or I'll go to the beach. Wake up, Casey. Hurry, wake up ! Happy birthday ! That's so nice. My gosh, I am so hung over. Yeah. How are you not ? Practice. You were the life of the party last night. At one point, you put a lamp shade on your head. You were so cute and cliché. It was fun. Thanks for the... cruller. - I actually had something else... - I didn't get into CRU. I'm sorry. But, I've been thinking... about us. And my life in Cyprus and the sorority. And I have decided... to stay. I can defer GW for a year. Maybe even two. You're not still drunk, are you ? I've even been thinking about taking up the house mother position at ZBZ. I love my life at ZBZ, and I love you. Why would I leave ? Do you know what I feel like doing now ? I hope so. Stop it. I'm gonna get some clothes on. Let's go. Well, nothing on the Fairy Job Mother so far. How are you doing on boy patrol, Julia ? None so far. You're still on vacation from yourself ! Look for boys. I can't vacate. I miss Evan. Are you going to do something about it ? Right. Just pour my heart out and plead for him to take me back. He's right over there. Just open up myself to him and possibly have him shut me down ? You and I have had our set of issues. If I can forgive you... maybe he can too. Can you give me a minute ? I'll meet up with you. - Hi. - Hi. Here's the thing. I'm just gonna get to the point. I screwed up... big time. I hurt you and I'm sorry for that. I still care about you. A lot, actually. And I miss you. And I'd appreciate a second chance. I can't. I appreciate your apology. And I can forgive, but I'm honestly not sure, if I can forget. Or if I even really want to. I'm still pissed. I'm sorry. So then... there it is. You can see a lot up here. You can practically see forever. Speaking of forever, they something I want to give to you. If you're gonna puke I'd throw it more that direction. I think I see some OCs down there. You know, I'm okay. Why don't you go first ? I thought you wanted to do this. Are you scared ? I'm not scared. It's just... - What if the cord breaks ? - That never happens. - Does it ? - Nah. Nah, never happens. Well, what if it's calibrated wrong and I hit the ground, bounce back up, hit the platform and the ground again ? Seems a little Wile E Coyote. There's some basis in real physics there. I think that's just the fear talking. So what if it is fear ? Fear's natural. It's good. It keeps you from making mistakes. Doing things that you're not ready for. Not when it keeps you from living your life. Having fun. I just don't want to do it. So I'm going to crawl back down. I'll see you on the ground. Not if I see you first. I ran into Rebecca earlier. She apologized. - Wanted to get back together. - And ? I said no. I mean, are you kidding ? You know you still like her. Why don't you give her another chance ? Because then if I get burned again, I'm the fool. No thank you. See, Cal, you're too nice. Guys. What the hell ? Is that the guy from the house ? And isn't that your little KT buddy paying him ? Are you buying some guns ? Who ? What ? That guy ? I've never seen that guy before. You hired that guy to kick us out of that beach house. Joke's over. You got me. I must be going now. No problems. So, if that wasn't his house, who's staying there now ? - Nobody ? - Nobody ? All right. Then we're taking back our house. All right ! Everybody listen up ! We should toast the Omega Chis for making this spring break memorable. Cheers ! We said you could invite one friend from school. Cap, I'm sorry, they caught me paying off Roy. Listen, we're taking back this house. We won it fair and square. So get out. We're not leaving, Chambers. You lied to me. You got three of our brothers expelled. Leave us the house, - we'll call it even. - No way. If you want us gone, then you're going to have to kill us. "Kill" ? What am I walking into here, boys ? Officer. Everything's fine. We're gonna turn the music down. And... these guys were just leaving. Who's house is this ? It's ours. It's theirs. You heard the man. We were just leaving. Come on, KTs ! Let's go ! Cheese and crackers ! Is this your donkey, too ? No, we've never seen that before. What else here isn't yours ? Who ordered the fat, ugly strippers ? What happened to the party ? - That's not ours either. - Have you been drinking ? How old are you, son ? I am 21, you jackass. I got a card to prove it. And that's Senor Domingo to you, jefe. Yeah, that's right. You just look so young, Francis. Let's get you outta here. I'm shutting this party down ! Everyone go home ! Except for you guys. It's your place. I need to see your IDs. Officer, listen... The fact is we just arrived. Any illegal activity has nothing to do with us. And we're in a fraternity. If we get in any trouble like this, we could lose our charter. Should've thought of that before you involved that innocent donkey. All right, Cap. Come on, man, we could lose our house. For real. Well, that's not what we intended but... Seems fitting, don't you think ? - Are you okay ? - What ? - Yeah. Hi. - Do you want some company ? Why not ? I guess I've already lost... Faith ? Faith Flowers ! It's me ! Ash... Taylor. - Ashed Aylor ? What a delicious name. - Thank you ! You can call me Ashleigh for short. I just wanted to say I'm really sorry about the whole porn thing. - What are you talking about ? - I'm the... someone you don't know. But you should. I'm graduating from CRU in a month. I've interview for jobs ranging from the assistant to the regional manager of blah, blah to the junior exec to the head of "Who Cares". I don't love any of that. So I just started to accept that I was gonna get a job I didn't love because that's what people do. Until I met you. Look at this dress. I made it out of a couple of really old T-shirts and dresses I had, because, one, I'm in college and poor, and two, I didn't want to throw them out and have them sit in a landfill. So, deconstructed fashion. It's totally on the rise because of the economy, because of how green everyone's getting. And I love realizing that. I love being able to imagine what the next thing will be, not just in fashion, but in everything. And the idea of being able to do that, what I love, and get paid ? That probably has to be the most amazing thing anyone can do. What I'm trying to say, Fairy Job Mother, is that I love you. I beg your pardon ? I mean, I love what you do. And I would love to do what you do. Or learn from you. Or get you coffee or whatever. What do you say ? Did you guys witness any activity with the donkey ? Do something, Chambers. They're going to shut our house down. What do you expect me to do ? They caught us with a freaking donkey. Some president. - Officer ? - Trip, why don't you let it alone ? At least he's doing something. Officer Nixon, we'd be happy to make a sizable donation to your department if you were to look the other way on this whole thing. Bribery, too ? Against the wall, Big Red ! You boys are screwed. Officer Nixon ? Hi. Can we talk in private ? I hope he doesn't screw this up. After Trip, it can't get much worse. We're going to lose our charter, aren't we ? Thank you. Thank you so much. All right, guys. We're good here. Let's go get some pancakes. - What the hell did you do ? - I handled it. So let's get our stuff back in here and resume our spring break ! Dude, you got my vote. Way to go, little bro. Maybe you do have what it takes to become president of OC. - Well, I learned from the best. - Thanks, man. You've shown me how incredibly loyal and generous someone can be. But you've also shown me how pride can... really threaten to ruin a guy. It's not your family or your money. It's your pride. You're gonna lose Rebecca because of that. What you doing ? I am just getting ready for my surprise birthday party. How about you ? Did Abby tell you ? It's a sorority, Ash. Not the CIA. Good, because I have a secret that I can't keep ! I... got a job ! It's not a job-job, more of an unpaid internship with this woman, Faith Flowers. She's a trend forecaster. - What ? That's perfect for you. - I know ! I'm going to New York ! My God ! It's really happening. Aren't you a little freaked out ? No. I'm ready. Case, when I started CRU, I thought I'd just get a degree, maybe get married. I never... really thought I wanted that much for myself. But... then I met you, and because of you and because of our friendship... I've come to want more for myself than I ever could've imagined. You always go after what you want, and I'll never forget that. You're my best friend and you always will be. Even if I'm in New York and you stay in Cyprus. Wait, you knew ? Yeah, it's a sorority. Not the CIA. Maybe I'm not as strong as you think I am. Yes, you are. Maybe you've just taken a vacation from yourself. Spinning ! Stop the spinning ! I'm so sorry. This is not what I wanted it to be for us. It's OK. We can save money back in Cyprus. Just say sex. Good lord, I'm from the South, not France. Where were you all day ? This is your fault ! You're like weed. You're my gateway. My fault ? I didn't get you wasted. Why'd you want to come here ? Well, not for the sand. I wanted a girl. And not a landlady. Or some sorority girl that's too insecure to stick by me. I wanted to have a real college experience like you did. And have fun. Because I only got two years left to do it. Should we go get him some coffee, or something ? You look like <i>Aliens vs. Predator</i>, but all in one human form. I need you. I need you, Casey. What's up ? I got into law school in Washington. That's great ! It's not, because I'm not going. I now see why Cappie doesn't want to graduate. What if I'm not ready ? What if I fail ? You're ready. There are bigger things out there for you now. I'll be alone. Remember when I first came to CRU, I was terrified. I was lonely. I didn't have a world. But if I had never came here, I never would've joined a fraternity. Met Cappie and all those guys. Calvin and Dale. I never would've had the relationship that I have with you now. Now I have a whole universe. - Did you ever read Peter Pan ? - No. See ? I've never even read Peter Pan ! I have no business leaving school. I have to stay. The first line of Peter Pan is "All children, except one, grow up." Wendy knew that at two years old. You're learning it at 22. Everyone has to grow up. Nobody's Peter Pan. Not even Cappie. Dale just threw up. This is my sister, Casey. I didn't know you have a sister. My God, you should've seen your face ! You were so surprised. Yes, I was. Thanks, Abby. There are a lot of really cute guys here. You're still on vacation. Not sure my vacation worked out. So I'm calling it a night. Despite Dale's vomit, I'm really enjoying Myrtle Beach. Here comes Calvin. No fighting. We need some BattleBots or something. So ? Phase four is complete. Even Trip said he'd vote for me. Then may Congratulate the future president of Omega Chi. - What ? - As president, I think my first order of business will be to declare a truce - between Kappa Tau and Omega Chi. - Wait, what ? It was all a joke ? A series of phases, to be exact, concocted by our Revenge Chair. The entire plot was brought to you by the brotherhood of Kappa Tau. The mob guy was actually Brother Rubik's Cube, Class of '85. The Myrtle Beach cops were Brothers Pez, Paisley, Tricky Dick and Disco Dan. All KT Brothers from the University of South Carolina, class of '79. Brothers for life. What you gonna do now that you don't have OC to kick around ? Enjoy life ? I saw Lambda Sig looking at me funny last week. I didn't care for that. I'm go get to the bottom of it. - How about we go on that walk now ? - Okay. Yeah. Rebecca ! Wait, wait, listen ! I'm... You're what ? I'm not the good guy. I don't always do the right thing all the time. And I'm always blaming my parents or the money. But the only person to blame is myself. I let my pride get in the way I don't want to lose you. You can forget what a mess I am ? You cheated on me because you don't believe you deserve happiness, but you do. I do. And we can find that together. I'd like to try. So, I've been... waiting for the perfect moment to give you something, and... I think now's as good a time as any. What is it ? I want you to wear my lavaliere. I love you, Casey. I love you, too. You're not as excited as I thought you'd be. Is it because of where it's been ? What ? No, it's just... I didn't bungee jump today because I was scared. And if I stay in Cyprus, I'd be staying because I'm scared. You're going to Washington, aren't you ? I have to do what's best for me, and that's law school. Don't you want me to go and succeed ? I do. I guess I'm being selfish because I know that means I'm gonna lose you. Cap, you can come with me ! To Washington ! You could transfer... I'm not sure I can leave. And I can't stay. But, I totally understand why you're scared to go. I'm not scared. That's okay. Leaving something can be terrifying. Is that what you're doing ? Are you leaving me behind ? - I want us to move forward, together ! - I don't want to move forward ! - Because you don't want to grow up. - What other choice do we have ? We are two different people who love each other very much. It seems like the only place where our differences don't matter is in college. Maybe this is just one of those college relationships ? If it is, it's the best one... of all time. Look, let's just finish the year out together, and... No, screw it. You know what ? Why wait ? If you don't have more faith in us than that ? Then we should break up now. - No, I don't want to. - Too late. It's done. All right ? I can't believe I was gonna give this to you tonight. I would've felt pretty college doing something like that.
