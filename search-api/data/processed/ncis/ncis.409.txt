Um... That's what I've been hearing all night long. Bzzzz. Bzzzz. You electrocuting sheep in here? Feels like it. You know what? That's probably my shredder. You know that's funny 'cause you say that like, well, uh... like I haven't been up all night listening to it. I'm sorry, I'm having... It won't happen again. It does, and paper's not gonna be the only thing getting shredded around here. Sorry. I'm sorry. It was an accident. Won't happen again. I think I killed someone, Tim. Team-NCIS.com presents : NCIS Season 4 Episode 9: Twisted Sister. (NoTV) Synch & correction: Orion for Team-NCIS.com Capture : FRM You okay? You asked me that 30 seconds ago, Mom. Yeah, well, you've been in there over an hour. Yeah, well, how long would you be in the shower if you were covered in mystery blood? You're sure that none of it is yours? Yeah. But you don't know whose it is? No. I told you. I was at Headliners with these girls from school, we were watching this crappy band, the next thing I know, I'm at your front door. You left out the part where you said you killed someone. Tim, that's not funny. You don't remember saying that? How much did you have to drink? Nothing. I'm under 21, remember? Really, because your fake ID says you're 22. How much? Okay, I had a few drinks. Sarah, do you remember what happened the last time you had "a few" drinks? No. That's the point. You can't drink. Last time you had a few too many, you painted "bitch" on Katie Hutchinson's garage. I would have done that sober. That bitch stole my boyfriend. Tim, relax. I barely even touched my second beer, okay? I remember because I had... You had to what? I had to study. That's right. After the concert, we went to the food court, but I left early because I had to go to the library. Good. Library's good and then? Why can't I remember? Someone could've slipped you something. No, Smart Girl 101, you don't take drinks from guys you don't know. We should still get a urine sample. I can't pee in a mug with a picture of Grandma on it. What are you doing? Calling the police. And telling them what? That I showed up at your front door with blood on my hands saying I killed someone? Besides, Tim, that could be animal blood. And what if it's not? Sarah, I'm a federal agent.I have a responsibility... Tim, I didn't come to a federal agent. I came to my big brother. McGee's not answering his cell phone, pager or MySpace IM. McGee on MySpace, I gotta see that. Keep calling. Still trying to get into his calendar, boss. You know, I'm not sure what the problem is. When I was framed by the Iranians for murder, I was late for many hours before anyone even noticed. You're not McGee, Ziva. McTimex's brain is hard-wired for punctuality. And sadly, scaring away potential mates. There we go. No doctor's appointments. He does have a personal trainer. Four times a week? And tomorrow, an 8:00 a.m. appointment at a Harley Davidson dealership? Either McGee's won the lottery or he's got a sugar daddy. Yeah. Gibbs. Where? Dead? Sailor. Waverly campus. Gear up. What about McGee? We haven't found him yet. I did. Or rather, he found me. Sent me an email. Woke up sick. Laryngitis, won't be coming in to work today. You know, I bet he sent you one, too. You still here? Hmm. Who emails in sick to work? If I called, they'd know I was lying. Oh, and if you have laryngitis, you can't call. Have you been saving that one for a comic book convention? Can we get back to the timeline, please? Okay... now you left the bar at 9:30 p.m. I got to the campus food court at around 10:00. You showed up here at my door at 2:30 a.m. That leaves four hours unaccounted for. I'm actually impressed. Is this what you do at work? Yeah?Really? State the obvious and make pretty pie charts? No, we collect facts and we formulate theories. But if you think you can do better. Well, okay. There are four hours unaccounted for. Of which I have no memory, so, I either drank more than I realized, repressed some kind of traumatic event, or was drugged. And the blood on my hands and the fact that I'm always careful with what I drink imply a traumatic event. But what and where? Answer... the shoes I bought yesterday. $32 on sale, plus I had a back-to-school coupon. They're muddy, but the soles are barely even scuffed, so I didn't walk the five miles to your place. Okay, so how did I get here? When I left the food court, I had $14 in my back pocket and now there's only two, and since it's a ten dollar taxi ride to your place, do the math, I must've taken a taxi cab here. And that's our first step. We find the driver. We ask him where I was. And when we find out where I was, we can find out what happened. Let's start by checking local taxi dispatchers. There's two major cab companies. Dozens of gypsies. I'm assuming you left from campus. It would definitely be a major. They'll have a log of the fare. Do you think you caught the taxi on campus? Ready! Five, six, seven, eight. Hit, one, two, roll, three, four,look, five, hit, six, seven, down, eight. Go, one, two. This isn't the XFL ladies. This is Waverly. Save the pole dancing for your boyfriend, Carolyn. Uh, you'll have to move your car, sir. You're in a passenger loading zone. I don't see any, uh, pass... Oh, well, you don't want to park here. You might want to yank out your rent-a-cop manual - and recheck the pecking order. - No, no, no. Your people are on the other side of the quad. Well, that was quick. Solve this case already, DiNozzo? No. It's my hundredth body. Hey, listen, you wouldn't mind taking... Sorry. That's a bad idea. It seemed less disgusting in my head. By comparison with what else is in there, I'm sure it was. Anything useful from that jogger,Ziva? If "I saw the body and I called the police" is useful, the yes... Otherwise, no. Can't tell how long the body's been here. Luckily, of course, I can. I must apologize for our tardiness. We had... trouble parking the van. Homecoming. I would have thought McGee would have beaten me up here. McGee's not here. Really? I could have sworn I saw him in the parking lot. Well, we're at a college. Pencil-neck geeks are a dime a dozen. Ah, let me see. Preliminary time of death: between ten and 12 hours ago. We have another body! I thought you said you had another body. I do. Actually, ten of them. Hey, what time is it? After 10:00. After 10:00? I missed my class.Why didn't you wake me? I wanted you to get some rest before... Before what? Sarah... You found my taxi. I haven't spoken to the driver yet, but... I did get a log from the company. And? And you were picked up early this morning at the quad. When I went to check it out, NCIS was there. What was NCIS doing there? Probably had something to do with the dead body. Where are you going? The library.I have to study. Excuse me? I have a Chaucer midterm coming up. Hey, Sarah! Hello! Dead guy! That's probably dead guy's blood on your shirt. I told you, that could be animal blood. It's not. I tested it, and it's human. Sarah, we've got to go to NCIS. Why? Why NCIS? Body was a sailor. Sarah! Hey! Do you know the sailor's name? No. I do. Dental records confirm the body is Seaman Jeff Petty, currently serving on the USS Enterprise. Docked at Norfolk last night. - Navy notifying the family? - As we speak. A duty I do not envy. Yes, when I was an officer with the regiment, I was twice called upon to render such services. I prefer combat to telling a family that one of their loved ones shall never be returning. Luckily, in this case, we are spared such a duty. You got a time of death on those goldfish? No time, but a cause. Asphyxiation. Suffocation? Over-feeding. Nicotine poisoning. I just got the test results from Abby. There was enough nicotine in their blood to kill... well, to kill a gold fish. That much is certain. How did that get there? Your guess is as good as mine. Yeah, the cause of death of Seaman Petty is more explicable. Sharp-force trauma to the thoracic area. Punctured the aorta, so death was almost instantaneous. The shape and depth of the wound suggests... - a combat knife. - a combat knife. We didn't find a knife. All we bagged was trash. Tell DiNozzo to keep looking. Well, Tony went home. He went home? He wasn't feeling well. Thought McGee might have gotten him sick. So he went... home? Well,actually,... the Director told him he could go. I'm not done, Gibbs. Make it fast, Dr. Mallard. Postmortem lividity suggests that Seaman Petty was killed on scene. Tox screen came back negative; no drugs in his system. His CO said he was a model sailor. There was very little trauma beyond the entry wound. No scratches, no DNA in the fingernails. He was surprised. Or he knew his killer. Sarah, open up. Sarah! Tell me how you know this guy! Sarah, I can't help you unless you talk to me. How do you know him? We used to date. Until he started seeing my old roommate. And? And... I threatened to kill him once or twice. Maybe even three times. This is that sailor that you were dating last year? You told me you didn't like him. What did you expect me to say, Tim? I really liked this guy and he just broke my heart when he dumped me for some skanky cheerleader. You threatened to kill him because he dumped you for a cheerleader? I didn't mean it. It was just one of those things you say, you know? Did anyone hear you say it? I never actually said it. I e-mailed it. Sarah, we got to go to Gibbs now. I haven't done anything wrong. How do you know? Tim, you don't really... You do. Sober, no, but you were drinking, Sarah. There could have been an accident. Tim, I swear on my life... How can you swear?! You don't remember what happened. If my own brother doesn't believe me, who the hell is going to? Sarah. What, are you gonna arrest me? You need to understand something. Our only option right now is going to N... Wait a minute. I thought they were brother and sister. They are, but they don't know it. Haven't you been reading the subtitles? There are subtitles? So much for being a film buff. Hey! Listen, I could... bore you to death with a lecture on German Expressionism in film if you'd like. You could never bore me. Well, that is very sweet of you, but you underestimate me. It is my contention, Miss Benoit, that the abstract nature of Expressionism in film... What are we doing, Tony? Well, I'm boring you with German Expressionism in film. We've been dating for over a month. Don't you find it a little curious that... we haven't taken it to the next level? You mean Italian Neo-Realism? - Japanese cinema? - No. Sex... Yeah... Yeah, sex, right. Yeah, is that something you might be interested in? Yeah. Yeah, I get that vibe from you, and yet we still haven't had it and you don't seem like the type who usually waits. Yeah, well, it could be because you remind me of my sister. You said you were an only child. I am. Could I have a serious answer... please? I don't want to rush things. Date Two is rushing things, Tony. Date 11, that's a violation of the Geneva Convention. If you always do what you've always done, then you'll always get what you always got. And while what I got had its perks, I'm looking for something different now. Okay, Tony, but just so you know, whenever you're ready... so am I. And then when we finished bowling, he walked me to my car. And? And he said, "I hope to see you soon, baby doll," gave me a peck on the cheek and then he left. Short and sweet. Oh, he is. Hey, I've been looking all over the building for you. Since we were low on agents, I thought I'd give Abby a hand. The only reason we are low on agents is because you sent DiNozzo home. Well, there's no sense in getting us all sick. Next time you send one of my team home, you clear it with me first, Director! Oh, I didn't know I needed your permission to manage my own personnel Agent Gibbs. Your personnel? Last time I checked it said Director on my door, not yours. The kids don't like it when Mommy and Daddy fight. You got the call log off the cell phone we found on Seaman Petty? There was damage on the DC run to the SIM chip, probably from the fall. Okay. Wow, 15 missed text messages. Someone's really trying to get ahold of... Oh, no, what do I do? Do I answer it? Put it on speaker. Hello. Finally.Where the hell are you? McGee? Boss? Why do you have my sister's cell phone? I got a better question for you. Why is your sister's phone doing on my dead body? Ooh, and I thought being sent to the principal's office was bad. He's still in the elevator? Per Gibb's orders. Awaiting El Jefe's arrival. How mad is he? Well, considering McGee's been covering for his sister who's implicated in the death of a Navy sailor... What were you thinking, McGee?! ...I'd say he's handling it pretty well. I would apologize, but I know how you feel about that. You got your voice back. I never lost it. No kidding? I know withholding evidence is a violation of NCIS policy. And a crime. One that I don't really care about. Why didn't you come to me? I was going to. When I saw the body, I-I know I had to bring Sarah in. No, before that. I couldn't take that chance. I don't know what my sister did or didn't do. But I know what it looked like. And we say, 'better ten guilty men go free than one innocent get punished, but I know from experience it doesn't always work out like that. I couldn't take that chance with Sarah. Not with the police, not with NCIS. Not even with you. She's my sister. Apology accepted. Cute girl. Hey. This is the one I found on McGee's iPod. I knew there was no way she could be his girlfriend. Poor McGee got the shallow end of the gene pool. They're here. I thought for sure probie would be limping. Getting, uh, soft, in your old age there, boss? Prime of your youth, sir? We needed it for the BOLO. Please tell me that's not for.. Citing a bench warrant for Grand Theft Auto. Guess that's better than a BOLO for murder. We need to find her, McGee. Right now, she's our main suspect. Witness. Spoke to the taxi driver who picked your sister up. He places her at the crime scene. And Abby confirmed the blood type on your sister's clothes, matches Seaman Petty. That's more than witness, probie. And there are the emails. Like the one that starts "Dear man whore" and ends with "if I ever see you again I will kill you. Love, Sarah." Got them off Seaman Petty's e-mail. Throw them on the pile and they add up to... Motive and opportunity. Why is she running? She's mad. She's scared. Says she has nothing to do with the murder. Thinks I don't believe her. Do you? Sarah's not a killer. But? But an accident's another story. - If she was drugged... - She wasn't. Abby ran the urine sample you took, and it was clean. Any other suspects? Maybe Seaman Petty's cheerleader girlfriend. At least your sister's not the only one writing threatening e-mails. Cheerleader was worried Popeye was getting his spinach somewhere else. Address? Ziva, I want that taxi impounded. DiNozzo, you're on McGee's sister. Ah, with great pleasure, boss. Boss, maybe Tony would be better on the taxi... - McGee... - Yeah. Go home. I can't have you working this case. If I go home, how do you know I won't keep working on it? Come on. I'll keep an eye on you. Hey. You're wondering if she did it? No, I'm wondering why McGee never told me he had a sister. This is Jeff in Bahrain. Handsome kid. He loved wearing that uniform. Almost as much as I loved seeing him in it. He was supposed to meet me at the food court. We were having freshman cheerleader initiations later that night. But I wanted to make time to surprise Jeff with... a surprise. He never showed? I just figured his ship was late. I told you we should have used carbon. If you can't get this thing working, I'm going to have to find some geeks who can. No, we can do it. Seen enough? No, no, no, actually, um... I was checking the water gun here. The check valve is on backwards. If you flip this... Real smooth, Einstein. It sounds like you and Jeff had a perfect relationship. We did. We were going to get married. You better make her pay for this. Who? That jealous bitch, Sarah McGee. She couldn't deal with the fact that Jeff wanted me instead of her. She sent him threatening e-mails, she trashed me in her blog. Blog? Yeah. What's a blog? It's a... blog. You know. No, I don't know. It's... something losers put online so that everyone can read. Are you going to arrest her or not? I saw her at the food court with her geek friends. When she found out that Jeff was coming to meet me, she left to find him. How do you know she just didn't leave? Because she killed him! - Boss... - Hey. I told you to wait outside. Why didn't you ask her about the e-mails? Maybe I don't want her to know that I know about the e-mails, McGee. There's a reason I told you to stay outside. And there's a reason that I came in. Look. Come on in. I take it this isn't a social call. I need some advice. And you came to me? Well, it was either you or Gibbs, and his track record with women sucks, so... I'm finding, um... myself in a particularly odd situation with... someone... special. Odd? Odd, yeah, odd. Because, uh... we've been going out for, uh... over a month, and, we... we haven't... done something that I usually do... you know, a lot earlier than that. And may I ask what it is that's holding you back from doing what you usually do? Yeah. Um... Because of the... particular importance... of this person, I thought it would be a good idea to take things slowly. Which is kind of a new concept for me. But... at a certain point, things have to speed up, righ... right? Are you attracted to her? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I could make a meal. Is she attracted to you? So what's the problem? DiNozzo. BOLO just came back on McGee's sister. Campus security has her. Well, let Gibbs know. He's there with McGee. I did. He wants us to bring her in. Okay, I'll be right there. Good luck. I'm Security Officer Tate. One of the librarians reported her. Apparently, she sleeps here a lot. How McGee-ish of her. Must be in the McGee-nome. You want her for more than GTA, don't you? I didn't have the authority to arrest her, - but if you want me to... - We'll take it from here. No, you can't have my number. I already have have your number, Sarah. It's not whays think. My eyes water when I read a lot, and these lights are really crappy. Are you guys here to arrest me? No. You do have to come with us, now. Yeah, sure. You are just being nice to me 'cause Tim's my big brother? No. I'm always nice to hot girls. You must be Tommy. Tony. Sorry. In Tim's book, you're Tommy. Which would make you Lisa? Where have you been? The library. I told you Io study. You know, Tony is much cuter than Tommy. Tommy? Hmm, you know if you rearrange these letters, you get... Timothy McGee. You should have told me this was a secret. Can't wait to read about your swashbuckling, and socially repugnant, Special Agent Tommy. And Lisa... the sultry and emotionally distant Mossad officer. Or their boss...L.J. Tibbs, who drinks to alleviate the burden of his messianic complex." Where is L.J., Dead-Agent-Walking? Evidence garage. Tony? Tony? I'm going to kill you. Where'd you find it, Abs? Stuffed behind the seat cushion. Hey, boss. You okay? Sarah, please, no! You didn't find that in the taxi, did you? Who studies while they wait to be interrogated for murder? A Mc-Geek. "Lisa's eyes reminded him of emeralds." Oh. "Flawed only by the icicles in her heart." He's dead. "And the Field Agent Tommy is a dogged pursuer of dirtbags." Yep. "And any skirt over the age of 18." Your brother's dead. Sarah threatened to kill Seaman Petty by e-mail. A taxi picked her up near the crime scene at the time of the murder. The blood on her clothes matches the victim's and her fingerprints are on the murder weapon. Other than being your sister, is there any evidentiary reason why she shouldn't be charged? But she is my sister, Director. Sarah may have a temper, but she lashes out with her mouth or a pen, not a knife. And I hope you have more to offer than brotherly love, Agent McGee. She was drugged. She showed up at my door groggy, barely able to walk. She couldn't remember anything except leaving the food court. And the lab reports for drugs and alcohol were negative. By the time those tests were taken, whatever was in her system had metabolized. And if that's true, whose fault is that? Mine,I should have taken - Sarah in earlier. - But you didn't bring her in. Agent DiNozzo and Officer David did. So your actions, or should I say inactions, did nothing to help your sister, but it did impugn the integrity of this agency. Forgive me, Director, for not putting the integrity of NCIS before my sister. It won't happen again. McGee. Hey. Boss, don't try and talk me out of this. Never let someone manipulate you like that again. Not even the Director. She wanted me to quit? That's her job, to protect NCIS. Come here. Sit down. Boss, you don't think...? You sit down here until I get back. Boss, you don't think Sarah did it, do you? I don't know, McGee. I'll know after I interrogate her. - Can I watch? - No. - Please, from observation... - No! Boss, I can't just sit here. Here, read a book. What's your major? English lit. You intend to be a writer like your brother? I intend on being a writer. Why the smart-ass answer? What? You put your brother down. No, I didn't. Yeah, you did. He just resigned because of you. No! But Tim loves NCIS. Evidently, he loves you more. I'm sorry. Fake tears don't bother me. I don't fake tears. Just lapses in memory. I don't remember! I just get... quick film cuts. Hold onto 'em. I can't. I guess you don't want to. I do. If you did, you'd remember. And how would you know? I've been there. Sarah, stop it! Stop it! What are you doing?! No! No! No! I stabbed him! I stabbed Jeff! What's your sister's favorite pizza? What? Her favorite pizza? Come on, Tim, it's not a trick question. Uh, cheeseless with pickles, Tabasco and peanut butter. Yes, yes, yes! Yes? You sister was doped. Where's Gibbs? Where's everybody? Interrogation. Well, go get 'em and bring 'em down to my lab. There's more! Abby's got great news. It's not great. It's actually terrible, but it explains why Sarah... What did Gibbs do to my sister? Nothing. She admitted stabbing Seaman Petty. Sarah doesn't know what she's saying. McGee... Boss, she was drugged. Abby has proof. Stay with her. Hey, hey. I remember the knife. I remember Jeff lying there. No, no,my little sister could never kill anyone. I was poring over all the forensic evidence: the trash from the crime scene and every inch of the taxi and I realized that the floor mat smells like Nilosorb. Nilosorb? Industrial vomit cleaner. So I took what was left on there. I ran it through the mass spec and found what McGee has confirmed to be Sarah's favorite late-night snack: cheeseless pizza with Tabasco, pickles and peanut butter. Yuck. But I also found traces of sodiumoxybate, aka GHB. It didn't show up in her urine sample because it metabolizes so quickly. Which is probably what makes it such a popular date-rape drug. You think Seaman Petty tried to rape her? Her ex-boyfriend? There's nothing like a death threat from an ex-girlfriend to get your dander up. Are you talking from experience, Tony? So the levels of GHB allowed me to triangulate a window of exposure. She was dosed at the food court. DiNozzo. Pull the security tapes from the food court. On it, boss. Ziva. Names of food workers, janitors and anyone working that night. What was I going to tell you? I don't know. What were you going to tell me, El Magnifico? Good job. But I have more. I solved the mystery of the smoking goldfish. At first, I couldn't figure out how they were lighting the cigarettes underwater, and then I found this. They were trying to kick the habit. Our little Nemos were swimming in a bag that sprung a leak. Sprang a leak... sprung, sprang, sprung... So their little lives flashed before their eyes in a nicotine buzz. Hey, do you think, since goldfish only have three seconds of memory...? Abby, get Ducky on that. I don't know, Gibbs. That is a very complicated piece of equipment. Probably have to go get my manual out... Abbs! Ducky. Yes, my little lotus blossom. Gibbs wants you. You know when the goldfish died? I was just determining the time they expired. You're using a little teeny tiny liver probe? Being cold-blooded, temperature is useless in determining the time of death. So you don't know? Au contraire. They died about the same time as our victim. Now how did you calculate that? Track Sara McGee from the time she enters until she leaves. Ah, okay. Ah-ah, oops. That was the wrong way. I'm sorry. Sorry, boss. One second. DiNozzo? Froze. This is sort of a McGeek thing. Get him. You know what a clog is? A shoe or a block to drain? On the Internet. I thought that was a blog, but, uh, my English is often wrong. Sarah McGee wrote a blog trashing her and the cheerleaders. Do you think you can find it? Probably on MySpace. Who is she? Seaman Petty's girlfriend, Sarah's ex - roommate. "These peppy little girls all skanked up to the nines "in their adorable cheerleading uniforms, "which had been mistakenly ordered in children's sizes, "were engaged in strangely homoerotic, adderol-fueled spastic movements that they called dance routine." Where's that from? That's my blog. You should let your sister ghostwrite for you, probie. Find your sister entering the food court. How do you get a ready-made cheeseless pizza with Tabasco sauce, pickles and peanut butter? Oh, I make it myself. Food court has everything but peanut butter, so I carry a jar in my backpack. McGee, isolate her table. Ready? One, two, down, up. Steady. Hold it, Heather. Uh! Take five. Whatever happened to quitting? After football season. Why don't you go home? I'd rather be here. Seen enough of my ass? What do you think, Tony? I don't know. There's a lot to see. Stay the hell away from me, jerk. It's amazing what a college education does for a girl's vocabulary, don't you think? Astonishing. I believe you know my sister. That was for spiking my peanut butter. And that was for setting me up to be raped. This is for being an accessory to murder. What? Madison? They're framing me. I didn't do anything. We got you starring in the food court show. Spiking Sarah's peanut butter with GHB. Oh, yeah, try and prove that from a security camera. Your greasy paw prints are all over my peanut butter jar. We have you leaving the food court with Officer Tate. You murdered Jeff? No! I was just using Tate to get even for this bitch's blog. And Jeff saw Tate grappling with her and tried to play hero. I'm not gonna hurt you. What are you doing? Let go of her! Drop it! Tate stabbed him. I dropped everything and ran. You stabbed him! Put the knife in her hand, put the cell phone in his pocket. You lying bastard! - Lying bitch! - Get 'em out of here. - I didn't do anything! - You have the right to remain silent, you have the right to do splits Let go of me! the right to wear short skirts... I'm sorry. Jeff was a great guy and he really loved you. How would you know? He e-mailed me. He said he was sorry, but he met his soulmate. It was you.
