- It was justified. - Rivkin is dead. Tony killed him. You could have walked away, but, no, you let him up! - You put four in his chest! - You loved him. Guess I'll never know. Gibbs. Perhaps it is best if one of us gets transferred to another team. Take care of yourself. - She's still in Tel Aviv? - When is she coming back? She's not. Guess she'll call when she's ready. Tell me everything you know about NCIS. You will tell me all that you know. Who you are... how you ended up here... what you are doing. And you will talk. I'm not going to tell you anything. NCIS Season 7 Episode 01 Truth or Consequences V1.0 LOL Synchro: Gaillots & Kujathemas. Rereading: Bruno & Magic Turtle. The Soviets had some success... with pure ethanol. This formula... is of my own design. Mixture of sodium pentothal... and several other agents I have found... effective... in extracting the truth. It will not take long for it to start working. You're going to be dead soon. Truth or not. I tell ya, I think this stuff's working already. You know, I... I have studied America. Carefully. I believe in... knowing... my enemy. I believe a man is as big as what he's seeking. I believe you're a big man, Mr. Macreedy. My name is Saleem Ulman. You will tell me who you are. I'm very Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. You know, a few months ago, I had... not even heard... of NCIS. And that may have cost the lives of several of my people. That will not happen again. Now please, tell me, what is your mission? We're... we're tasked with pursuing crimes that involve the United States Navy or Marine Corps and their families. And our duties are... expansive. International terrorism, espionage. Even, you know, an eight ball of methamphetamine. Stand down, Petty Officer Dimarco! - You hit him high, I'll hit him low. - I don't like the sound of that. - You hit him low, I'll hit him high. - <i>Our team consists of a gang of four.</i> Tight-knit. My partner is Tim McGee. Small muscles, big brain, heart of a lion.</i> Together we're virtually unstoppable.</i> - Virtually. - I got him! Tony, he's going for the knife! Our team leader is... the fearless Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.</i> Former Gunnery Sergeant, Marine sniper, coffee aficionado and functional mute. Piece of cake. - Simple as pie. - Yeah, smooth as silk. And the fourth member of your team? Lost her. Her? For the last four years, that slot has been... filled by... Mossad Liaison Officer Ziva David. Mossad. Mossad. And... - NCIS... - That's right. The organizations... responsible for the deaths of my men. Geez! All I can say is, if we killed them, they must have been bad guys. They were martyrs for the cause! So your team is here, then what, to finish the job? To shut down my organization? Say, can I get a glass of chardonnay or something? Is your team here to finish the job?! Not only are you wrong, but you're wrong at the top of your voice. What does that mean, huh? Can you imagine Nicholson in <i>Bad Day at Black Rock</i>? - I would have liked to see that. - Listen, where is the rest of your team? I don't know. I don't care about your team. I don't care about my team. Okay. You were driving in the desert without backup. So what are you doing here? Well, Saleem, there's only one force on earth that can short-circuit a man's better instincts, put fire in his veins and makes him dive headlong into danger with no regard for his own well-being. Vengeance. I'm here to kill you. Vendetta. DiNozzo... is an Italian name. An educated man. Got my BS from Yale University. Yale. I got my BS on the streets. Yale. You guys got a lousy football team. 18 national championships. When was the last time you won one, a hundred years ago? 1927. Short memories. As a people, that is my impression of you. Wait, sorry, you did an impression of me? I missed it. Go back, do it again, but this time why don't you gargle with some sand? Get that <i>basso profundo</i> going. That's how you nail my essence. It's all in the voice. How did you choose me... As the... target... of your blood lust? I didn't. Hell, a little while ago, I didn't even know you existed. I was happier then. Tony, I'm not your home theater guy. Don't be redunculous. Of course you're my home theater guy. - All right, you getting a picture? - Yeah, it's just not crisp, you know. It's not rich. What's your source, Blu-ray or satellite? Neither. It's the streaming HD thing from... a net films account. The greens are blue, the blues are green, the oranges are pink and the reds are sort of eggplant-y. A problem with your component cables. You're streaming through a wireless setup? 'Cause if it's HD, you need wireless-n components. Also, plasma, 10-80i, 10-80p? - Will you just come over and fix it? - What's in it for me? Digitally remastered 1955 classic, Bad Day at Black Rock. Spencer Tracy with the one arm. Is that anything like money? Because money is what is customarily exchanged for services rendered. It's computers. It's your thing. If I had a thing, I would show it off all the time. There are rules against that, DiNozzo. Grab your gear. We've got a dead petty officer. - Another meth overdose? - You know as much as I do. Tony, now? It feels like now. - You want to go? - No, you go. I got to gather my thoughts. Hey, Boss? I think it's time we filled the empty chair. - You do? - Yeah, we do. It's the right time. We got to get started on this. Personnel files are starting to stack up on your desk. Okay. You pick. After we get back. First, got to narrow down prospective agents. It's got to be a woman. - Those are just the women. - Are there photos in here? Boss, really? Tony picks? Because coming from anyone else, that might be considered a lapse in judgment. Okay, you both pick. - That makes much more sense. - You don't trust me to be professional? No casting couch. Petty Officer Kevin Wingate. Disciplined for drug possession. Low quantity. - Personal use? - What kind of discipline? 60 day restriction. - He hasn't been off the boat? - Not in two months. Well, he didn't get the dose on land, he could have cooked it up himself. Or someone brought it to him. Shipmates thought he'd kicked. - I guess he fell off. - We do not guess, Timothy. Nor do we assume, presume, conjecture or prognosticate. While not officially a member of our field team, Ducky is an essential element in the investigative process. An encyclopedic mind that never stops working.</i> Sometimes his mind is connected directly to his mouth.</i> Dilated pupils, profuse sweating. His shirt's still damp. Brings to mind a classmate of mine in medical school. E. Landon Reginald Ailsworth III. - Nobody's named that. - Except his father. And his father's father. Reggie concocted his own amphetamines. He liked to use the stuff to keep himself awake while cramming for exams. Ended up the final himself when he passed out half an hour before pencils down. Reggie made it. This fellow was not so fortunate. Death... about six hours ago. McGee, finish sketching an inventory of Wingate's locker. DiNozzo, duty roster. Prints, trace... scour this ship. So many tasks, so few hands. Have either of you two heard from Ziva? No. - You? - No. It's all so very sad. But I supposed the time comes to move on. Thank you, pantsuit girl. This is Claire Connell from the DEA. Pleased to meet you, Special Agent DiNozzo. We don't really stand on formality here. Why don't you have a seat. Wowsers! That's some grip. Yeah, I was a pack-a-day smoker. Quit by occupying my hands with power putty. Look at that. Demonstrates strong will. Excellent aptitude scores, high reviews from her colleagues at the DEA. I see that. So why would you want to leave then, Claire? I was involved in a relationship of a personal nature. Became difficult for the other party to control their emotions in the workplace setting. Yeah. Got to hate clingy guys. - Clingy girls? - He didn't ask. - So don't tell. - It was interfering with my ability to perform my duties at the highest level. Sure, sure. You know those movies where they have the really beautiful woman, but they put her in the big glasses and tie her hair back and have her march around in the big baggy clothes, but then the turn comes, the penny drops, and the ugly duckling magically transforms into a swan? That won't be an issue. I find that my looks... have the tendency to prevent people from taking me seriously. That's fantastic. She has my vote. - Really? - Really. All right, okay. Let's start the on-the-job training. Special Agent Gibbs will make the final decision. Let's go see him. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Right this way. You know, it's all about chemistry, the zing, the s... The pah! What is "pah"? Pah. You know? Got to know how to zig when I zag. Got to know how to bob when you weave, rock when he rolls. That's the pah of it all. Pah! She's unflappable. She's unflappable. Strike one. Might be a little easier to find a new drummer for spinal tap. Ziva's not replaceable. The... the one you lost. Then why aren't you looking for her? If I could drag her back, I'd do it in a heartbeat. But that's impossible. Ziva David is dead. I've always been fascinated by simple cause and effect reactions... What can be done to the human body just by adding or subtracting. My own personal drug of choice since my College days... is caffeine. Keeps me sharp, alert. You are probably feeling clarity, an impulse to talk without censor. It's a chemical process taking place in your brain. Now, I understand your instinct to resist, but in actuality, you are speeding the release of adrenaline, which only serves as a catalyst. That's better. It's less painful that way. Who is in... control of the flow of information? Must be a lonely place to sit at the top of the pyramid. Not to mention... wee bit uncomfortable. Leon Vance. Some people don't like him, some people don't trust him,</i> wish someone else were in his place. Show me someone who doesn't complain about their boss,</i> they're either lying or they're unemployed.</i> Got an update on the meth ring? Petty Officer Dimarco is recovering. Question him today. Hope he can shed some light, at least on who put the knife in him. One set of prints, Leon. He was so out of his mind that he stabbed himself? Been hitting a lot of dead ends. Yeah, well, we've been one short. How goes the search for David's replacement? DiNozzo's got a new candidate. You heard anything about Ziva? No. Two months in the dark now. But Mossad tends to operate behind a veil of secrecy. You've confirmed she's part of Mossad again? Yeah, I believe so. - Field? - Likely. But you haven't heard anything? You've got a good relationship with Director David. You figure the subject of his daughter must have come up. Man's got to have some feelings about putting her back in the field. Well, he must be sharing them with somebody else if he does. Eli's being tight-lipped about it. Like you, Leon? I don't have anything to share. But you think he does. And I'm tap dancing around the edges. Yeah, I know how that goes. Petty Officer, I know that, physically, you've been through quite an ordeal these past few months. We're hoping that you could tell us where the drugs came from. Well, I wouldn't know what they look like, Sir. I mean, I don't take drugs. Someone must have slipped them in my orange juice. Why would they do that? Isn't that how you take them? Where did you see that? I think it was an episode of <i>90210</i>. I never really liked that show. Not my cup of tea. So, how come agent McGee is conducting the interrogation? We prefer the word "interview". "Interrogation"... has a negative association. Okay. Got it. So what do they call these rooms? Observation. And the other side of the glass? Not everything has a name. I thought I heard someone refer to it as interrogation. Well, you know, maybe that's some kind of informal shorthand. - Really? - Yeah. Agent McGee's in there softening the big guy up for the bigger guy. Agent Gibbs is gonna crack him. Crack him for what? Buying the wrong hit of meth? This guy doesn't know anything about anything. You expect him to give up his dealer? Let's see if you can figure it out. Is this some sort of test? You like tests? Is that some sort of test? No. I mean, it's... Everything's a test. Excuse me, excuse me. Looks like they pulled up stakes. Haven't been able to determine where they resettled,</i> if they resettled. - Captives? - Possibly. NCIS confirmed the presence of a woman...</i> no ID and no idea whether or not she's still with them.</i> You're doing a bang-up job there, Chad. I'm a long way from Dubai, Gibbs. Our local network tends to rely on nomads roaming the desert.</i> They don't tend to like our faces much.</i> Though they'd respect mine more than they'd yours.</i> You think so, huh? One look at that baby-smooth skin and they think they spotted another girl.</i> Careful. Don't go getting all native on me out there, Dunham. Chad reporting from Chad. Next up, Captain Rebecca Becky Hastings, US Air Force. - Fighter jock. - Yeah, grounded for medical. Natural born thrill seeker. Likes to live on the edge, take risks. Pretty eyes. Thinks NCIS might offer some... - new challenges. A real Daredevil. - What do you think? Women. - Yeah. - Yeah. So what was that about, with Dunham? Tracking terrorist training camps in the Sahara desert. And the woman you were talking about, the captive, any theory who she is? Dunham says that Mossad presence has increased in North Africa. Prepping an offensive? Or course correction, cleaning up a failure. What kind of failure? The kind with casualties. Is that all you know? That's all you can tell me. I got it. All right. You know, in Arabic, the word for "desert" is "Sahara" so Sahara desert is actually desert desert. A lot of sand. Duck pulled the plug on my Dimarco interview. Said the... strain was too much for his weakened heart. Yeah. Gibbs signed off on the new girl... Rebecca Hastings. Seems like a pistol. Or a firecracker. Maybe a spitfire. I been thinking about buying some tight red leather pants. Something that really cradles my butt. - It's not normal. - I'm kidding. I'm not gonna buy... It's not normal that we haven't heard from Ziva. I mean, nothing! Not in this much time. It's not normal. Well, maybe she just wants to make a clean break of it. Maybe from some of us but not all of us. Unless you did something to her you're not telling me. It's not normal. - No, it's not. - Thank you. What if she can't contact us, huh? What if something's stopping her? Or someone. Yeah. I'm not the only one thinking this, am I? - No. - Gibbs is thinking about it, too... He's not talking about it, but he's definitely sniffing around. - So what are you gonna do about it? - Everything I can. I'm gonna start digging. Well, you can't do it alone. You gonna stop me? That's not what I said. When he wakes up, you will learn... what a mistake your partner made... following your lead. You believe I am responsible for the death of this Ziva David. So, you travel halfway around the world... to kill me. That is insane. I'm insane? You kill indiscriminately. Wars are measured in body counts. The news carries a running tally. You change... the world... with rivers of blood. There is no reason... to kill just one person. Sure there is. How did you find me? I'm skilled. You did it... by yourself? Really? No. Not really. How did you find me? Who are you leaving out? I can't believe you were gonna leave me out. - It wasn't personal. - Abby, it was for your own benefit. So which was it? Abby Sciuto, NCIS resident forensic scientist, heart and soul,</i> a paradox wrapped in an oxymoron, smothered in contradictions in terms, sleeps in a coffin.</i> Really, the happiest goth you'll ever meet.</i> It was hubris, you know. McGee thought he could do it without you, and he was wrong, - he was so wrong. - No, no, no. Abby, I was the one that wanted to enlist your help. Can we get past this? Please. We've been tracking Ziva's movements as best we can. - Since when? - Since she stayed in Israel. And took Rivkin's place on the Kidon unit. I've been doing the same thing. I mean, it's weird that Ziva hasn't contacted me. It'd be one thing if she hadn't picked up the phone and called me, - but I've tried to reach her. - Psychics, crystals or telepathy? No jokes. Okay? Ziva is universally absent. It's freaking me out. All right, let's compare notes here. We've got NCIS on the ground in Dubai trying to figure out what Mossad is up to. While Mossad's trying to figure out what some terrorist is doing. And somewhere in the middle of this is Ziva. And we know that Gibbs thinks the Director... knows more than he's letting on. And no one's telling us anything. - So we have two options. - And they're both illegal. Hack into Mossad... - Or hack into Vance. - That's it. I'm out of here. I'm done. - So much for the Daredevil. - Forgot about her. Whatever. Let's get hacking. Yeah, Gibbs is in interrogation. I'll take it. Damocles. Yeah, I know. Like "the sword of". Out of Aqaba. Where is that, Jordan? Nothing. I'm sorry. I don't mean to startle you. Are you Special Agent DiNozzo? No, I am. Who are you? I'm Officer Heather Kincaid. I'm here about the job interview. That you apparently forgot about. No, I didn't. I didn't forget. I mean, you know... Call you back. Heather Kincaid. Let's see, Seattle PD, - just like your father and your uncle. - And two brothers. Four-year varsity starter. U-dub volleyball? Go Huskies, yeah. Listen, can you walk while you talk? You know, I've actually never attempted something so complex before, but I'm a quick learner. Sarcasm. I like sarcasm. - Who doesn't? - Not that much. Like I told you last time I was brought in, Sir, someone must have slipped the drugs to me. Lots of enemies on board? No, Sir. So, it's the opposite then. Lots of friends. Yes, Sir. I'm not sure what it is you're looking for exactly, but... - You're sure you're it? - That's the pitch you've been getting? Yeah, everybody's a perfect fit for this job. Sure. In this economy. Can't just drop someone in the mix. It's a lot harder than it looks, trust me. I'm only asking for a shot. I don't know if we need the help. Frankly, you got a pretty good gig already. You don't need us. It's not you, it's me. Do you really want to do this? It's ridiculous. Look at this guy. This guy... who we've been babying and coddling and nursing back to health for the last 3 months. The poor helpless drug victim with the bad heart, almost killed him. He's the dealer! After the first overdose of his own rotten stash, this guy dosed himself to draw suspicion away from the fact that he's the pusher. We just wanted to get high. I didn't mean for Kevin to end up dead.</i> You got to believe me. I'm sorry.</i> And two dead before we figured it out. Anyway, we're not hiring right now. Sorry to waste your time. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. It's the goat! - The goat. - Sounds like you got something. We're the two zuzim. Gibbs is our father, and he used us to buy the goat. - It all makes sense now. - Sure. We accessed Mossad's encrypted files. They weren't in English, so we had to do a little rudimentary linguistics. Hit the Hebrew school nursery rhymes. Chad gadya, Tony, chad gadya. "One little goat that my father bought for two zuzim." It was originally an Aramaic children's song. Actually, way it goes, uh, there's a part with god, an angel of death "and the killing..." "That killed the butcher that slew the ox" "that drank the water that quenched the fire" "that burnt the stick that beat the dog" "that bit the cat that ate the goat" "which my father bought for two zuzim <i>chad gadya</i>..." "<i>Chad gadya</i>." - So what's the goat? - It's the information that McGee and I recovered from the burnt laptop in Ziva's apartment. With the location of a camp in North Africa run by a man named Saleem Ulman. We gave it to Gibbs, Gibbs gave it to Vance, Vance gave it to Eli David, who read it, and then he put Ziva and a team on a Jordanian freighter called the Damocles. Out of Aqaba. Yeah. - Bound for the Horn of Africa. - You got a manifest? It's a cargo ship. Could be a direct supply line to Saleem. - Where is it now? - Don't know. - Find it. - We tried. It's... No record of it appearing after may. - Why not? - 'Cause it was lost at sea. Damocles went down in a storm, 28th of may. Off the coast of Somalia. There were no survivors. After that... business as usual lost all meaning. Blah, blah, blah. Computer stuff, blah. Autopsy report. Words. Just, there's so many words and there's things and stuff and emotions.</i> Thanks for listening. Got a dead marine. Grab your gear. Got a missing kid. Grab your gear. Some idiot smuggled a koala on a submarine.</i> Grab your gear. Grab your gear. Grab your gear, your gear. No. No. No? We have an obligation. Saleem Ulman's got to be stopped before one more person dies. Make your case. It's a supply chain. Everything moving through the area... By ship, by truck, by camel, by donkey. Everything Saleem and his men need to stay alive somewhere in the desert. NCIS on the ground in Africa has tried to track common elements. Like weapons, medical supplies, car parts, gasoline, food, drink. We have zeroed in on items of a more personal nature, various batteries, electronics, even music and entertainment. Because they are human, after all. This is the manifest from the lost cargo ship Damocles. We know it was heading for Saleem's camp, and it contains the cipher to breaking our code. - And have you? - We believe we have. We've isolated the needle in the haystack... An anomaly, one specific characteristic. A brand-name foreign import not easily available in Europe or Africa. Got it all the way from the United States at high cost, high difficulty. What are we talking about? Ta-da. You had to have your Caf-pow, didn't you? It's just a little chemical addiction, don't worry. Maybe you picked that up at your American college! Maybe we're not so bad! You ought to rethink your master plan! You okay, McGee? You awake? Yeah. When do we move? Not yet. - He's rattled. It may be our best shot. - No yet. Wait for my cue. Questions are being asked in town about missing NCIS agents, concern that U.S. Forces might mobilize. One of you will tell me the identities and locations of all the operatives in the area and the other one... will die. I'll give you a moment to decide who lives. How was your summer? Out of everyone in the world who could have found me, it had to be you. You're welcome. So, are you glad to see me? You should not have come. All right then. Good catching up. I'll be going now. Oh, yeah, I forgot. Taken prisoner. Are you all right, McGee? I'm just glad you're alive. You thought I was dead. Oh, yeah. Then why are you here? - McGee didn't think you were dead. - Tony. Why are you here? Couldn't live without you, I guess. So you will die with me. You should have left me alone. Okay, tried, couldn't. Listen, you should know I've taken some kind of truth serum, cause any... questions that you don't want to know the answer to... I did not ask for anyone to put themselves in harm's way for me. I do not deserve it. So what are you doing out here, some kind of monastic experience? Doing penance? It is justified. Get over yourself. I have. Now you tell Saleem everything he wants to hear. And you try to save yourselves. I am ready to die. That's not how it works. How what works? The plan. You have an escape plan? They have 30 men, heavily armed. They have antitank, antiaircraft weapons. What do you have? Well, that's where things get a little tricky. - You don't have it. - What do you mean? That satellite photo's showing thermal activity at this location. We have 4x4s coming and going. How much longer this guy's going to be there. We served this up on a silver platter. You don't know he's there at all. We're not talking about kicking in a door and dragging a guy out in cuffs. It's a military mission on foreign soil. - And he's a target of interest. - And he's our only interest. Now I've talked with the joint chiefs, I've talked with Mossad. The hard truth is that we're not going to send a seal team into the desert, based on a theory that Saleem Ulman can't live without his daily Caf-pow! Director... We need confirmation that he's there. We don't have it. Under the present circumstances, we just can't do it. I wish the circumstances were different. So do I. What? Is that it? Yeah, what else is there? Maybe we send a couple of agents to the region. What for? Gather some intel. You know, put some eyes on the target. Change the circumstances. Change... circumstances? And you can sell that to Vance? Oh, yeah. Strictly investigatively. - Of course. - Of course. You guys have a whole little thing going on I'm not seeing, but I get it. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, Bob's your uncle. I'm hip. I dig it. - Good, 'cause I need volunteers. - I volunteer myself and special agent McGee for the secret fact-finding mission thingy, that's not secret, in the Sahara. What are you going to do? You don't want to know. Good talk. Thanks for volunteering me. Come on, you always said you wanted to travel. On my own time. On your own dime? Are you crazy? We could never afford this. That does it for quadrant whiskey four. - There's no sighting. - I'm going to call it in. Hello, gentlemen. Hi there. We come in peace. Say the thing. Say the other thing! Wait... you got captured... on purpose? Yeah. - These men are killers, Tony. - I know. That's why we have to stay alive long enough to not get dead. That would involve being rescued. Yes, it would. How long will it take? I don't know. - How long do you think I'm talking? - What's the plan? We fail to contact Dubai, word gets to the carrier group in the med and they scramble F-22 raptors that burn sand into glass. How long that's gonna take, I don't know. Hours or... days. Can you fight? Hey, Saleem. What's up, man? What's the commotion? We're moving out. Good. I was getting tired of this place. We're not taking prisoners. - Okay, it was nice talking with you. - No, we're not done yet. If they do not check in, their people will come looking for them. - Ziva, shut up. - Kill me. You'll need the Americans for leverage. I don't make bargains. - Do you make pizza? - What? Stop! Stop! There's something I haven't told you yet. - And what is that? - Well... I told you about the brains, I told you about the guts, I told you about the muscle, the scientist, the politician, the leader. I told you about every member of the team... except myself. - The part I play. - Which is? I'm the wild card. I'm the guy who looks at the reality in front of him and refuses to accept it. Right now I should be terrified, right? But I'm not. 'cause I just can't stop thinking about the movie <i>True Lies</i>, where Arnie's strapped to the chair and shot full of truth serum, then he picks his cuffs and kills everybody. You have 30 second to live, Saleem. You're still bound. You're lying. I can't lie. And I didn't say I was gonna be the one to kill you. Remember when I told you my boss was a sniper? Go. Man all assault teams move out! Get me contact!</i> Okay. Look out! Come on. Here we go.
