"Sake-bombing"? Oh, come on, Kate, don't tell me you've never heard of sake-bombing. Would I ask if...? Forget it. I don't want to know. You take a cup of hot sake, you drop it in a beer, you toss it back, and... Sake-bombing. Great for a cold. I'll stick to honey and hot tea, thanks. McGee, Kate's never been sake-bombing. Yeah, I don't think I have, either. I work with a pair of wankers. And you make three, DiNozzo. Morning, boss. Morning. Cold or flu? Just plain cold. Don't worry, I will sneeze into my tissues... unlike some people. I have allergies, Kate. Never had allergies. Never had a cold. Never had a cold? Nope. Never had the flu, either. Why do I believe that? If you were a bug, would you attack Gibbs? I get colds all the time. Of course you do, Probie. This one is just addressed to "NCIS Special Agent." I think that's mine, McGee. Huh? How do you know? I recognize the lips. And the scent. Gummy bears? We've opened a letter with white powder. Use the southeast corridor to the holding room. You all know the drill. Tony. Letter opened in Special Agent Gibbs's office dispersed a fine white powder. Initiating bio attack procedures. Third floor is evacuating. McGee, you up on procedures? Yeah, we, uh, we shower, burn our clothes, get our blood tested. Nobody leaves the building until the substance is identified except... Lucky me. I win a free trip to Bethesda to be pricked like a pincushion. They've shut down the air. Let's hit the showers, Tony. Thought you'd never ask. Sorry, boss. Who would send me a letter with anthrax? Pick a girl, Tony any girl. That's not funny, Kate. Yeah, I know. This is serious. I know, Tony; I'm sorry. At this very instant, someone is incinerating my Ermenegildo Zegna suit, my Armani tie, my Dolce Gabbana shirt and my Gucci shoes. Hey, you know, it might not be anthrax. I like the sound of that, Probie Yeah, it could be smallpox, bubonic plague, cholera... Probie! ...foot powder, face powder, talcum powder... Honey dust! "Honey dust"? Honey dust. I give it to girls. Women- sorry, Kate. I give it to women at Christmastime. Very sensuous. You apply it with a feather. You don't use the whole chicken? I never heard oney dust. Yeah, that's because your mother raised you to respect women, McGee. It makes a woman's skin feel silky sh. When kissed, it tastes like honey. Got a box of Honey dust last Christmas. No card. Think the post office screwed up, Boss. Someone else gotr bottle of Jack and you got their... Doesn't the post office irradiate our mail? Yeah, that's right! All Federal mail is funneled through the Ion Beam facility at Bridgeport, New Jersey. If it has DNA, it dies. The diseases that you name, they have DNA? They do. Oh, you should have let him squirm. Then, it's no worries! Unless the post office screwed up again. You should have given the letter to me, McGee. I know, boss. It's not McGee's fault. Tony snatched it out of his hands. So, it ad? You did grab it, Tony. Lame excuse, Probie. You should have stopped me. Where do you t you're going? Find out who sent the letter. You cannot leave autopsy! It's negative-pressured so airborne pathogens can't contaminate e the building. y, e scrubbed, sanitized... for all I know, sterilized. I have an investigation to open. I have a possible contagion to contain. Until your blood test clears you, I cannot permit you to leave this room. Who opened the envelope? He did. No, no, no... it wasn't me! I'm just kidding. I'm your pincushion. Did you inhale any powder? I might have. We took blood. Jimmy. have four blood vials on ice, to go. It's a c I had it be I came in this morning. Which makes you even more susceptible to airborne pathogens. You should go to hospital, too. no Kate, play it safe. Go with Tony. That's safe? How long are we going to have to stay in isolation? At least overnight. Yavubeds au hitwhen you that creasewhen you push... get anthrax, how will you feel? Not as bad as you, DiNozzo. t' I'm warning you, DiNo I do not feel well. You need to x. You need a foot massage. I don't want you anywhere near my feet. :You py. :I donâ€™t want you touchiy mattress. If you don't el well... arguing contin in dista electr rock playin So how long to Atlanta? Um, less than an hour. Your music's sweet. So are you... ooh! Talk to Mama. I didn't take you for the cheerleader type, Abby. Oh, I'm not. Grammy taught me that. She was an Olympic swimmer. Won the silver in the 200-meter butterfly. What does swimming have to do with cartwheeling? Nothing. I don't understand. You can't think logically with Abby. Her mind operates like a pachinko machine. What was the powder, Abby? White. With a hint of tan. Abs... That's all I know until my baby speaks to me. I'm auto-sampling for anthrax, botulism, plague, cholera... all those nasty little bio-buggers. How long? A couple of hours. I thought you said these tests were fast. It's not a pregnancy test, Gibbs. You should drink more water. Tony! Your urine's too dark. I have a cold. I don't believe you're commenting on my... ew! Neither do I. Dr. Brad Pitt. Yes, it's my real name and no, we're not related. Wish we were... I'd love to meet Angelina Jolie. If I said what he said, you'd... ...elbow me. It's not the Four Seasons, but let's hope you're not here long. Negative pressure? Mm-hmm. Air can flow in, but not out. I'd like to meet Lieutenant Emma Ingham, your duty nurse for tonight. Hi, guys. How are you? As a precaution, I'm starting your prophylaxis with streptomycin. Prophylaxis is a measure taken for the prevention of disease, Tony. That's why I use them. Oh, you don't want to encourage him. Sorry. Take any bed you want, you guys. Thank you, Nurse Emma. But it's prudent to keep some separation in case one of you has beeinfected. Thank you, Doctor. Brad. We're informal here. Kate. Using sun lamps... Brad? UV... kills bacteria in the air... although I can arrange for a sun lamp if you wish. Oh, not for me. It's for Kate. What? Yeah, a little nude sunbathing might get rid of those tan lines. Doctor, could you put him to sleep? Please. Bye, Nurse Emma. Bye. SWAK? It's "Sealed With a Kiss," Gibbs. Didn't you ever get a love letter? Does a "Dear John" count? I feel sorry for you, Gibbs. Is there a return address? "27 Old Mill Bottom Road, Annapolis, Maryland." McGee, got that? Got it. Wish I had my PDA. Use Ducky's. Ah... Agent Gibbs, sir... Dr. Mallard doesn't have... Requisition replacement cell phones and weapons for my team. Go! Pistols? Well, no, Palmer, crossbows, if you think they might work better. Canceled stamp? Noon yesterday, Annapolis. Open it. Normally I'd request a "please," but considering the situation... Boss, I can't find Ducky's PDA. McGee, it's a pad and a pencil. Ah, beautiful calligraphy. Beautiful paper. Must be 32-pound cotton rag. Abby, does that mean you can trace it? The watermark will tell me where it was made, when it was made and who sold it. The person that sent this may as well have signed it. You know, there was a time when every young woman of breeding was taught calligraphy. My mother still tries, but her hand shakes so that even I can't read all her missives. Can you read this missive, Ducky? Oh, yes. It's perfectly legible. I think he means read it out loud. Oh, sorry. Of course. Uh... "If you are reading this "and have not initiated "biological attack procedures, "I suggest you do so immediately, "since the powder dispersed "by opening this envelope "contains genetically altered... ...Y. pestis!" Which is Latin for what...? Plague. The powder in that envelope carries bubonic plague? Pneumonic is me likely. There's more than one? Oh, there are three, actually. But pneumonic is by far the most dangerous since it can be spread simply by breathing the Y. Pestis particles. Tony must have breathed in some of it. It may not be alive. Y. Pestis needs a host or moisture for it to survive more than a few hours. Plus, it was irradiated when it when through the mail, boss. I got Honey Dust for Christmas, McGee! I'll narrow my test to pneumonic Y. Pestis. If I can isolate the strain, then Bethesda can hit it with a specific antibiotic. Yeah, well, that may not help. It says here, "I have genetically altered the Y. Pestis to render it impervious to antimicrobials." That bitch! She created a strain that antibiotics can't whack! Ducky, give Bethesda a heads up. Right. A SWAK does not mean that this bitch couldn't be a bastard. You're so right, Gibbs. I have this friend who's a transvestite. Her lips could out-SWAK Angelina Jolie's. Remember, McGee? You met her at my birthday party. Yeah. The, uh, low-cut red dress with the built-in plastic... I saw that, Gibbs! Read, or you'll feel it! Not while you're down there. What? "However, there is an antidote..." She made a magic bullet! "...which, if administered within 32 of infection, "will eradicate the disease. "To procure the antidote, "NCIS must make public the true results reported in dossier R- Zero Three-Seven-Seven." McGee, pull up the file. Yeah. Romeo Zero Three-Seven-Seven. On it, boss! That it? That's all she wrote. It's gilded inside. I can see the SWAK through... We have a moisture strip in here! Yeah, keeping the bug alive until the letter is opened. Afraid so, Gibbs. Check that canceled stamp, Abs! One way to get around postal irradiation to not to use the post office! I- I spoke with a Doctor Brad Pitt. You're kidding. No, that's his name. He made a point of stressing he is not related in any way to the actor. Hey, did you hear when, um, Brad and Jen split up... Abby! Gibbs, I can't until I can put this under a microscope. And I can't do until NCID gives me approval to irradiate. Okay. Which will be when? The Navy is sending a sample to Atlanta. It should be there... well, now. And then it'll be 12 hours for DNA confirmation. Duck, what's the incubation period? A day at most. How long until it kills? Oh, not very long, I'm afraid. In the fourteenth century, the novelist Boccaccio wrote that plague victims had lunch with their friends and dinner with their ancestors in paradise. McGee, where's the file?! Boss, I cannot access it... Ducky, e're coming up! No, we've already been through this, Gibbs. You can't! Know what this feels like? I'm afraid to ask. Like I'm the King of Cool. Elvis? Elvis was the King of Rock and Roll. Travolta is the King of Cool. Well, thanks for the clarification. And do you know why I feel like Travolta? I feel a movie coming on. The Boy in the Plastic Bubble. Travolta plays this boy born with an immune deficiency. This was before AIDS. He lives in this giant plastic bubble. Tony... Tony, please. We're stuck here together. Could we just make a pact? Until we're out, I won't make fun of all the stupid things you say, and you won't tell me any more film scenarios. Deal? Deal. Thank you. Emma. Yes? You may find this of interest. You look pretty without the mask, by the way. Ralph Bellamy plays the doctor. Now, Ralph Bellamy was this great old-time actor- he was in His Girl Friday with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. I cannot believe that Gibbs broke protocol! He didn't. He left autopsy. But not isolation. McGee. Yeah? You use Abby's computer to access that case file. On it. Okay. Abby. Pull surveillance videos from the squad room- everything from 2300 last night, when I left, until McGee came in this morning. You got to get a life, Gibbs. Last thing I need is another wife. Life. You got to get a life. Boss! Boss, I found the file. It's a rape case. Get the investigating agent down here. I- I can't. It was Pacci. Put it up on the plasma, McGee. Okay. Sarah Lowell, age 21. Senior at Vassar. Raped February 10, '01, at the Admiral's Bay Hotel in Annapolis. Surely you remember the case, Jethro. The maid found the poor girl naked, tied to the bed two days after she was raped. Duck, contact Cassie Yates in Norfolk. Tell her what happened. I need her help. Yeah, good idea. Gibbs, I thought Cassie was working narcotics suppression? Four years ago, Cassie was Pacci's probie. The victim was visiting Annapolis to register for an advanced study program at Saint John's. Police had the case for three days before they called us in. They found a Navy suspect? A dozen of them firsties were partying at the hotel the night of the assault. Firsties? Academy seniors. They'd just got their fleet assignments, and... Are you scanning? Gibbs, I can multitask: I can listen to you; I can scan the video; I can rub my tummy... DNA testing cleared them. Closed our investigation. But someone wants it reopened. McGee! Call Annapolis PD. I want their file on this case. I spoke to Cassie. She remembers the case. She'll be here in 15 minutes. From Norfolk? No, Anacostia. She's working a drug sting. Boss... Boss, I can't call. They're not gonna be able to hear me. I'm gonna use the computer. Gibbs! Look who else doesn't have a life. Tony came back around midnight. He does his best work at night. So he tells us. Here's Tony leaving. That's Ben, the mail boy. He didn't do it. Why not? He's a vegan. Hitler was a vegan. Hitler was a vegetarian. Big difference. Vegans are so against cruelty, they won't even use cosmetics tested on animals. Abigail? Could... Y. Pestis be altered to withstand irradiation? No way. Altered or not, it's still a living organism. Could the gilding in the envelope protect it? It would have to be at least ten mils thick. This is barely one. Abby, I do not want to hear any more uh-ohs. Sorry. But this SWAK didn't bleed through. There's another one inside. Get that letter out here where you can examine it! Gibbs, I told you, I have to wait for Atlanta to... Any doubt it's pneumonic plague? No, but... Then no buts, okay? We're losing time. Kill those bugs! Now! Think they really zap bugs? What? These blue lights. Are you serious? Ever heard of a placebo, Kate? Tony... placebos are administered for a psychological effect. Precisely. How do you know these lamps aren't there to make us think they're helping, hmm? Maybe because they're there to kill whatever bugs we breathe into the air. You may have a point. You're afraid, aren't you? Kate, come on. Me afraid? You ever seen me afraid? Well, not when the danger's something that we can confront. But all we can do here is lie around and hope that we're not infected. Now who's afraid? Anyone with half a brain. I take that back. You're not afraid. All the blood cultures came back negative except for Special Agent DiNozzo's. He's infected with Y. Pestis. Damn it, Abby. How much longer? Gibbs. Patience is not your virtue, is it? Look at the plasma. Moldy bread? It's a Y. pestis microbe from the powder in the letter. This the Y. Pestis as the human race has known it for half the millennium the strain of the plague to fight with antibiotics. The one in the letter has blue tips. It's been genetically altered to resist antibiotics. You catch that, you're stuck in the dark ages, which personally I wouldn't mind, until it killed me. This wasn't whipped up in your local meth house. No, this took a hot molecular biologist and a big-bucks lab to make this bio-weapon. Oh, my baby's calling. I ran a mass spec on the SWAK. You're analyzing lipstick instead of the letter? Well, I figured anyone who's into calligraphy has got to wear esoteric lipstick. And since all lipsticks are tested by the FDA... You'll identify the brand. Yeah. If it's as rare as I think it is, I can find out who sold it. Oh, yeah, that's good thinking, Abbs. What? Good thinking, Abby! I don't know, Gibbs, I can't hear you. It must be the helmet on your head. Good thinking. Not nice, Gibbs. Not nice. This is weird. All the basics are there wax, oil, eosin dye, titanium dioxide, but they're at such low levels... Whoa. What is that? The reason the Y. Pestis survived postal irradiation. 72 percent of the lipstick is pure lead. A lead SWAK on the outside of the envelope. Lead SWAK on the inside. In between? Y. pestis on a moisture pad. This is one smart bitch. Wash your mouth out with purple soap. Cassie. Well, are you suppressing drugs or selling them? Working undercover. Everything I'm wearing's confiscated, even the La Perla underwear. Nice. Gibbs, is that you playing Teletubby? This the anthrax letter? It's not anthrax, it's plague. Thank God. Anthrax scares the hell out of me. May I? Yeah. I know this return address. Back-tracked it to the Admiral's Bay Hotel, Annapolis, where the girl was raped. Gibbs. Gibbs. All the blood tests came back negative except... Tony. Yeah. Get it off, Duck. Is he sick yet? Not outwardly, but the doctor says his temperature's elevating. The Y. pestis is attacking his pulmonary system. Hi, Cassie. Hey, Ducky. How far are we into this 32-hour window? Too far. Tony will begin coughi soon. When his sputum becomes bloody, he'll only have a few hours to live. Abby, get that damn letter out of there. I'm getting it. This is too easy, Gibbs. Custom paper and calligraphy that's traceable. A gene-altering bio-attack. You know who sent it. No. But I know who they want us to think sent it. Bedtime snack, Brad? Mm. I.V. drip increases the efficacy of streptomycin. They teach you "efficacy" at Harvard Medical? Michigan. Can't be. It's too weird. Why, you a Wolverine, too? Buckeye. Wait. You're that DiNozzo? '92. Columbus. We kissed our sisters. 13-13 tie. You broke your leg in the fourth quarter. You broke my leg in the fourth quarter. Oh, my God. They're gonna start bonging beers next. I don't think so. Oh, no, you don't know, Tony. He epitomizes sophomoric. His blood test came back positive. Positive... You're okay. He's the only one infected. So you didn't feel like an old man at spring break? You kidding? Coeds love a... mature man who can bong a beer in under six seconds. Leaves me out. So tell me, Doc, what have I got? Pneumonic plague. Plague? Plague. Yeah, Tony, plague. 'Cause only you would go off and get a disease from the Dark Ages. I didn't put plague in the letter. You opened it. Yeah, so I opened it. What are you so upset about? It's not like you're lying... Yeah. That's right, Travolta. I'm infected, too. Oh, Kate, I'm sorry. Well, you're going to be sorrier. No. Don't tell me Gibbs got it? No, no. Just us. But I am going to make your life hell. How? You can't be worse than plague. Maybe you can. Maybe she can. I'm warning you, DiNozzo. You know, I recall a couple of plague flicks. I'm going to tell Emma all of your dating tricks. Flesh and Blood comes to mind. Paul Verhoeven directed. Rutger Hauer starred. Tony thinks speaking Italian turns women on. Obviously you never saw Jamie Lee Curtis in A Fish called Wanda. Kate... I know. You want to start my I.V. I catch your cold, I'm gonna be very pissed. She'll be okay, right? Hey, McGee. Yeah?! Special Agent Yates needs your computer. Cassie. Hey, McGee. Can I sit in? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Boss... Cassie and I had parking spaces next to each other at Norfolk. Why are you yelling at me, McGee? So you can hear me through your... helmet. The blood tests were negative. Sweet. Not for DiNozzo. Positive? Is he going to be okay? If hisn't, he'll be answering to me. Almost there. No, Cassie, I already downloaded the NCIS report from the rape investigation. My notes are in my training file. I was only a Probie, but Pacci had me interview Sarah. Yeah, you're a female about the same age. Easier to talk to you than it is a male agent. Didn't help. She couldn't remember a thing. Traumatic amnesia. Not unusual for rape cases. If she had amnesia, who accused the midshipmen? Her mother. Recognize her? Vaguely familiar. How about in this photo? Good God, yes. That photo was on every front page in the world. She was more famous than Hanoi Jane. Blow that up. Get closer on the headband. Oh, my God, that's a SWAK. She a microbiologist? No. But the best in the world work for her. Hanna's CEO of Lowell Pharmaceuticals. McGee, I want a search warrant. On it, boss. Grab a change of clothes, meet me downstairs in five. Go to Bethesda, keep me updated on Tony's condition. Of course. Find out why Kate hasn't checked in. You got it. I got the phones, but they wouldn't trust me with a weapon. I wouldn't either, Jimmy. That's Agent DiNozzo's cell phone, sir. Gibbs. Why are you doing this, Kate? Damned if I know. But I'm doing it. You're not going to tell Tony. Well, I've already informed Dr. Mallard you're not infected. Ducky will understand. Gibbs will be the problem. No, the problem is is that Tony can infect you. What, with all the UV lights and air scrubbers... or are they just here for patient morale? I cannot permit you to stay. This strain has been genetically altered to resist antibiotics. You realize what that means? That the I.V. in Tony's arm is useless. So why do it? Well, it can't hurt. And it gives him... Hope? Yeah. Kate. Tell Dr. Brad about the wet T-shirt contest you won. Tell Emma about the transsexual you tongued. That never happened. That never happened... Thanks for passing along the cold, Kate. How do you want to handle this? The subtle approach. You serve the warrant. I'll shove my Sig in her face. Gibbs, Hanna Lowell's been arrested at more protests than Jesse Jackson. She won't be intimidated. Okay, then I'll shoot her and I'll go after whoever made the damn bug for her. You're not going to kill her. I said shoot, not kill. There are dozens of microbiologists here. It would take days to interrogate them. Tony doesn't have days. Do you know where her office is, or should I ask the receptionist? Boss always has the top floor office. Excuse me. Excuse me! You have to check in with the receptionist. Do you have an appointment? No. We have a federal warrant. Security alert. Federal agents coming up... They're here. Okay. It's about time you got here. I left enough cookie crumbs. You left more than cookie crumbs, lady. I regret I resorted to such a dramatic act, but you people at NCIS left me no choice when you lied to protect the Academy. Now, you admit that a midshipman raped my daughter and this will all be over. The DNA testing cleared... Oh, stop it. I know how easy it is to dope a DNA test. You love dramatic acts. They can be very effective. The effect of this one is going to imprison you for life. That long, hmm? You're dying. Rather rapidly. Which makes incarceration highly unlikely. From the looks of it, you want to protect just about every living thing on the planet except for federal agents. My daughter never recovered from the horror of that weekend. The truth will help her heal. Please, please give it to her. You won't get that antidote until that midshipman... We don't need it. The Post Office went postal on your plague. Zapped it right through the lead SWAK. No one was infected. Oh, I don't believe you. I don't give a damn whether you believe me or not. You are under arrest for biological attack on a federal agency. Take her to interrogation. I'll wait here for the task force to arrest the others. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right... There are no others. I acted alone. You are not a microbiologist. I stole the Y. pestis! Dr. Pandy doesn't even know it's missing. Dr. Pandy. What? Where's Dr. Pandy's lab? North wing, ground floor, BL-Alpha. But you need authorization to enter the North Wing. Someone was infected. I hope it was Westmoreland. Lay back, Tony. All right, everybody behind the shield. Tony, I'm going to need you to take a deep breath and hold it. I don't think I can, Brad. Maybe Emma can do it for me. You have very healthy lungs, Emma. Is he always like this? Unfortunately. Tony's humor has always been sexist, juvenile, raunchy. Funny. Sometimes can be funny. There is no antidote. I developed a vaccine, not an antidote. It's of no use once the victim is infected. Hanna misunderstood. She understood. No, it's the brain tumor. That's what's killing her? It's inoperable, obviously affecting her mind. Why else would a woman who fought to ban biological weapons use them? I don't know. Why is Lowell Pharmaceutical making them? We're not. You didn't create this beast? Yes, but only to develop a defense against it. Antibiotic-resistant diseases are potential terrorist weapons. A terrorist isn't killing my agent, you are! I understand your anger. No, you don't. But if you don't save him, you will. It has a suicide chain that stops it from replicating after 32 hours as a security precaution. It dies? Yes. It's dead now? If it's over 32 hours since the specimen has been infected, all the Y. pestis is dead. However, the damage will have been done. The specimen is going to die? No. No, not necessarily. He has the same chance of survival as those infected in plagues of the past. Probably better since he would be healthy and young. What was the survival rate of the past? People were weakened by depleted crops, bad nutrition. Damn it! What was the survival rate?! 15%. It looks like pneumonia. Worse, I'm afraid. Showing signs of cyanosis. His fingernails and lips are going blue. The Y. pestis is starving his body of oxygen. It's too late to reverse, isn't it? It's never too late. Until I get the body. I'm sorry I teased you with all those movies, Kate. Teased? You've tortured me. For two years all I've heard is John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, James Bond. James Bond is a character... ...played by Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan. Why are you wearing the mask? 'Cause I have a cold. Why aren't you sick? 'Cause I'm stronger than you, Tony. No, you're not. Am, too. Tony, Tony, sit up. Kate, you should leave- now. Oh, God! You were brave to stay with him, Kate. He's dying, Ducky! Ah, the hell he is. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who the hell are you? His boss. The bug had a suicide gene. It's dead. Been dead for over an hour. He's no longer infectious. Tony, listen to me. You listening? I'm lis... I'm listening, boss. You will not die, you got that? I said, you will not die. I got you, boss. Good. Now... It's you new cell. I'd get the number changed. Women keep calling for "Spanky." You need to rest. Dr. O'Dell, Orthorpedic, please. Dr. O'Dell, Orthorpedic. Can you excuse me? How's Tony? Ah, he'll make it. What happened? Hanna lost it in the car. Started rambling, flashing peace signs. Once she bared her breasts and shouted, "Make love, not war," I drove straight here. Sure it wasn't an act? Her neurologist says it's the tumor. He just left. He wants her relead into his care. Not likely. He can see her here as much as he wants. That Sarah? Just as blank as four years ago. Sarah, this is Special Agent Gibbs. I am so sorry. I can't believe my mother did this. I knew someday Mother would do something terrible. I told her, but she wouldn't believe me. Told her? That it wasn't a midshipman. So, you remember who assaulted you? No. How do you know it wasn't a midshipman? I heard they were all cleared. Are you sure you don't remember? Yes. You know who raped you, don't you, Sarah? Sarah? I wasn't raped. We all thought it was funny... tying me to the bed. I d said that the midshipmen looked cute in their uniform. I was kidding! And so when he went out to get us some burgers and shakes, he tied me up. Nobody's going to disturb you. Oh, help! So that way, I wouldn't run off with one of them. It was just a joke. And then when he didn't come back, I started going crazy. First worrying about why, and then, and then... being found. What happened to him? He was killed by a hit-and-run driver crossing the road. Why did you say you were raped? I was tied naked to a bed. What else could I tell my mother? Can I sleep here? As long as you don't give Tony that cold.
