NCIS Season 6 Episode 20 Dead Reckoning V1.0 LOL Synchro: Gaillots. Rereading: Bruno & Magic Turtle Got here fast? I thought you were riding a desk at the agency, trying to stay out of trouble. Guess that didn't work out. Afraid if I gave you too many details, you wouldn't have shown. Think they shot each other. That the best story you got? One I'm sticking to. Don't know who he is. This one is Andre Vogel. High up in the organization of Jonathan Siravo. You've heard of him. Kidnapping, smuggling, piracy. See Siravo's picture every day on our most wanted wall. Then I guess I'm doing you another favor. Source in Malta tipped me Siravo is back operating in the States. Supposed to show for a meet here today. Unfortunately, CIA has no... criminal jurisdiction domestically. It never seems to stop you. You legally can take him down, Gibbs. Okay, so... you got here early to check out the place? Yeah. Guess they had the same idea. Lucky for you, they both shot each other. Yeah. .45. Your own weapon of choice. Carry a nine-millimeter these days. Any chance Siravo will still show? Call it a gut feeling. Glad you could join us, McTardy. Where's the boss, man? I need a superior to sign off on this. Hand it over. I'm clearly superior to you in so many ways. - Where is Gibbs? - We thought he might be with you. No, I've been at the range doing my annual qualifications. He has not been in this morning. No empty coffee cup in his trash. Maybe he had an appointment. Doctor, dentist. Check his calendar, McGee. No, soon as I start going through his stuff, he is going to walk in and catch me. Forget it. I cannot believe this. I'll do it. Watch the elevator. McGee, the stairs. Now. Nothing... I don't even think he knows how to use this thing. He lives alone, maybe something happened to him. No one would know. In a tragic story of obsessive hobbying turned deadly, an NCIS agent was discovered in his basement, crushed between a large homemade boat and an even larger bottle of bourbon. Film at 11:00. - McGee, call him. - And say what? "Hey, boss, we're just calling to check up on you." No, you call him. - Not me. - See if his cell phone's on. - Phone's on. - Where is he? - Forget it... he's going to know. - How would he know? - Because he knows everything. - Do it. We need to know he's okay. He's in a two-block area of Anacostia. - It's him. - We're dead. What do you mean, "we"? You're the one who tracked him down. Tony, pick it up, pick it up. - Hello? - Saddle up. Hey, boss. Where we going? Construction site, 625 East Rosewood. East Rosewood. Hey, isn't that in Anacostia? That's a good guess, DiNozzo. Got a tip. No sirens. Jonathan Siravo is en route. Jonathan Siravo? We're taking tips from Trent Kort. Why don't we just run with scissors or talk to strangers? Maybe they've got some candy. Go to hell, DiNozzo. Feels like we're halfway there. Didn't realize we were processing a crime scene. We're not... yet. - What happened? - Got the tip about Siravo. I called Gibbs. We got here and found the bodies. Looks like they killed each other. Sounds like crap. Boss? Siravo is our main concern. Set up a perimeter. Kort and I are down here. Go. We do what Gibbs tells us. You don't really think those two guys shot each other? Look, I dislike Kort as much as you do, but the truth is... Really? You dislike him as much as me? He tried to kill me. He blew up my car. I'm sure he had his reasons. There's a sedan turning in. - Occupants? - Just the driver. Got a visual. Car is stopping. Federal agents! Don't move. Who the hell are you? Perry Sterling, 49. CPA, certified in Maryland. Currently resides in Virginia. No record. Graduated <i>cum laude</i> from Princeton. Is there any connection between Perry and Siravo? None that we have found. Jonathan Siravo, insurance salesman, no record, suffered a head trauma from a motorcycle accident six years ago. Disappeared from the recovery room following surgery. Reappeared one year later as a major crime lord. A severe personality shift. Well, according to NSA and Interpol, Siravo's enterprise has spread to drug smuggling in Mexico, kidnapping in Bolivia and an interest in a Ukraine pipeline. His finger is in many eyes. Pies. Guy moving that much money should be leaving a paper trail, but he doesn't. Guess that's why he's still in business. NSG intercepts show Siravo's hired a gang of Somalian fishermen to hijack ships at sea, and most recently a cargo vessel by the name of Borealis. Panamanian register. Went missing this morning in the Gulf of Aden. Carrying military parts and a crew of 27. Siravo having more weapons... not a good thing. We need this guy now. Then, Gibbs better get Perry talking. Director Vance. I heard you were our tip on this double homicide. Just sharing intel. On a CIA op? On American soil? There is no op. Hence my call to Gibbs. By the book now? It's a new day. "Yes, we can." And you two just happened to show up at the end of the gun battle. Timing is everything. Look, it's my busy season, and I'm... running around like a chicken with its head cut off. And all I'm thinking... would be thinking if my head wasn't cut off... is how to account for... overflow expenditures. I'm... looking for Arlington. I take Anacostia... obviously a mistake... but my cell takes a dump, and then my car navigational</i> system is whining to make an illegal U-turn, and I don't even think she knows where we're going. I was... asking for directions. Jonathan Siravo. I'm his accountant. You launder his money. Yeah. He responds to my creativity. I respond to his... terrifying demeanor. I divert cash through monetary exchanges, take profits from stolen goods, form shell companies, resell the stuff, then make it look legit. We meet when he's in the States, strategize on investments. Like the cargo ship Borealis. Not one of his holdings. It's missing, along with its entire crew. I don't know anything about that. Siravo hires Somalian fishermen to hijack ships. They'll gut the crew. Throw them overboard. 27 lives... are in your hands. I want to help you, I really do, but I can't give you Siravo. I do and I'm dead. He can get to anybody, any time, anywhere. I need immunity. Stay here. I'll contact the U.S. Attorney. They won't let him walk without a full polygraph. It's gonna take time. Okay, I'll keep Perry on ice. Check out his story. And Kort's? He calls you, you pull up, shots ring out. Not quite, Leon. It was already over when we got there. You didn't take your team. I didn't know what it was yet. It was Kort. Abby, it did not fall out when I removed their clothes.</i> Then it's a disappearing act, Ducky. You have two bodies down there. - Last time I checked. - From which you have extracted... Three slugs! Kill-shot on the first man came from a .45. Double-tap on the second came from the first man's Scorpion 380. But I have half a dozen shell casings down here from a third gun which seems to be nowhere... Bye, Ducky. Crime scene's not a priority. The link to Siravo is. Okay. I recovered cell phones from both the dead guys, and a Blackberry, and a laptop from Perry Sterling. So far, nothing on the phones has given us anything to track Siravo. - Laptop. - No. Perry's no fool. He'd keep all the important information in his head. He is a killer gamer, though. And he plays a boatload of Sims. Translation: video games. The rest of it is mostly spreadsheets, bank accounts and porn. Spreadsheets and porn... that's two totally different things. - I already know that. - I was just checking. So, basically, you've got nothing. Nothing? Gibbs, I have the mystery of the missing gun. A third gun suggests a third shooter. This is Caf-POW! country, but yet there's no Caf-POW! anywhere. Looks inconclusive. Inconclusive? Gibbs, I just told you that there was a third shooter at the construction site. But I could always go double-check that. Very... slowly. Yeah. Gibbs. Status on the Borealis. It's a boat, and it's missing. Status on you is, you're really irritating and I wish you were missing. DiNozzo, like it or not... It's "not". We're on the same side. I see your lips moving, but all I hear is "lie, lie, lie". And I don't know what's more insulting. The fact that you're trying to use us, or you think we're dumb enough to actually buy it. Someone's buying. I'm in the building. Oh no. That visitor's badge only gets you in the lobby. It's not a backstage pass. I'll tell you what, though. What you can do is run downstairs to the gift shop, get yourself something nice. Like a mug or a T-shirt, or a personality. International Maritime Bureau confirmed a location for the Borealis. - Where? - Indian Ocean. Captain spotted Siravo's vessel approaching, and he took evasive action. - Lost his comms in a firefight. - They were boarded? No, the pirates never made it on board. Then what are we looking at? Rewind. That's the pirate steamer. Crew of the Borealis is fine. No survivors from the steamer's explosion. Salvage crew says it looks like remote detonated ordnance. So, this morning, two of Siravo's men supposedly gun each other down at the construction site. And now, someone plants a bomb on his ship. Someone is taking out Siravo's entire crew. I should ask for the tops that aren't childproof. - "Masalamine." - For collagenous colitis. Tried Prevacid for GERD. Gastroesophageal reflux disorder. Apparently, I need an upper-bowel study done to know what it is for sure. They thought it was celiac disease and told me to stop eating so much gluten. I didn't even know I was eating any gluten. Stress can't help much. Two bodies this morning in Anacostia. Nine more of his crew in the Indian Ocean. He's liquidating. Who? Siravo. I should have seen it. He had me consolidate his funds. Almost 300 million. He's made his fortune. Closing up shop. Leaves no use for you. He was gonna kill me, wasn't he? He still might. Last one. Can I have some water? First immunity, now water? No more demands. - I hate to dry swallow. - Siravo, account numbers. Not without immunity. I'll give you a name. Victor Flores. Flores is Siravo's number two. I already know that. I know how to get a hold of him! How? Have you ever played "Captains of Industry 3"? "Captains of Industry 3"... the completely unnecessary third installment of the not-so-popular sequel. Capturing all the fun of being a corporate CEO and building your very own business empire. Not playtime, Elf Lord. You got that right. COI3 was universally panned as '08's worst MMORPG. It sucks. So why was Perry spending up to seven hours a day playing it online? He sucks? Maybe. Still, what would he get from COI3... a game that nobody plays? Real-time communications in uncrowded chat rooms. You can message people to discuss game strategy, talk trash... Or send their fellow criminals messages. Coded messages. We have all of Perry's account information. We can read his chats. That's a lot of chatter to decode. It's playtime. According to Perry, Victor Flores is in the number-two slot. Flores is a munitions expert, likely the button man. Contacting him may be the only way to get to Siravo. - Not that he'll be too willing to talk. - Been a lot of internal bloodshed. We're still kicking around theories about Killian and Vogel. Would you care to chime in? Double-suicide pact. Secret lovers couldn't stand to live a lie any longer. Too many question marks. DiNozzo, safe house for Perry. Take Ziva with you. Secret lovers... Don't touch any of my stuff. Yeah. Keeping me on a short leash, Gibbs? Yeah, and a muzzle if I have to. I thought we'd turned a corner in our relationship. You ask me for something, I ask you for something. I didn't ask you to dig up dirt on Vance. But you read the file anyway. No, I don't waste time on fiction. What motivation would I ever have to mislead you? I respect that you're suspicious. Caution is an asset in our line of work. Trust is elusive at best. No, it's not, not between us. It's impossible. But I honor my debts. Such nobility. Somewhat hollow given your fallback position. You're not really sticking your neck out for me. Vance comes down on you, you're already thinking you've got the goods on him. Words are cheap. Actions speak louder. Or to put it in parlance you'd understand: measure twice, cut once. Doesn't look that safe to me. Why aren't we in a hotel? Haven't you ever seen <i>Bullitt</i>? Bellhops, maids, room service... it's all a bad idea. No one knows we're here. - This all smells. - God. It's musty. How about some fresh air? Stay away from the windows and the door. And the wet bar. This is going to be a lot of fun. Place is a mess. Whoever was here last didn't clean up. That would be me and McGee. Let me guess. Basic cable. Uncle Sam's dime. I'm a very light sleeper. I can't share a room with anyone else. Was not an option. I haven't eaten all day. Any chance we can arrange an early dinner? Local cuisine. I have a very delicate stomach. I'm on a strict macrobiotic diet. Can't wait to see what happens. I'm gonna kill this guy before Siravo does. McGee, that's a terrible place to put a railroad spur. You're never going to get clearance from the city officials. I made a six-figure charitable contribution to the councilman's fund, so he's going to cut me a pretty sweet deal. Not with the price of iron skyrocketing. You should have taken the deal with the guy from Singapore. It's all part of the process. Right? Yeah. Messaging with people from around the world, that's how you play the game. Perry looks like he's playing, but he's actually communicating with Flores. Sending and receiving coded messages. Perry told us where to find the cipher key on his laptop. Now, they use terms from the game. For instance, steel means guns. Hospitals are for emergencies. Or a deal gone bad, or a problem with law enforcement. Cabbage is... Money. You know how to communicate with Flores? Yeah. We have been. We're trying to set up a meet now. We can't track this guy, his character? Well, Flores uses any of a dozen characters in scattered locations. - It's the Wild West in here, Gibbs. - But, you are looking at the sheriff. We got a response. Flores wants to meet Perry at the Stone Basin Hospital. Which, according to the cipher key, means emergency meeting, Rock Creek. - The park. - In an hour. Pork bellies are falling. School was never fun as a kid. I wasn't into sports. And I was always nervous around girls. I didn't have a lot of friends. My parents thought... if I got a pet, maybe that would help. Sounds like a good idea. That's when we found out about my allergies. Had to give Buttons to a cousin. You know, you're not a bad-looking guy. You're being kind. No. Actually, I cannot believe you never had a girlfriend. There was a girl I kind of dated for a semester, sophomore year of college. Yeah? She was just using me. Soon as she passed Econ Statistics Analysis 340, I never heard from her again. Ironically, I thought... earning a lot of money would help me with women. Now it turns out, all it's going to get me is prison... or murdered. Danger is a turn-on for women, right? Some women. Yeah. Come on, open up. Food's getting cold. How are you? Any word on my immunity? I hear zinc lozenges help. You might want to try some vitamin C or echinacea. You mean your immunity? No. I need to take one with every meal. You can skip a meal, Perry. Trust me. You don't want to be in this small apartment with me if I haven't had my medicine. Flores got here early. Maybe we read the codes wrong. It's clear. Found Flores! Then who is this?! Guess we're not gonna be talking to Siravo's number two. - So much for Perry's hot tip, huh? - On the contrary, McGee. Flores is still warm. 97.8, to be exact. This man was killed less than half an hour ago. 97.7 on this body, Doctor. Yeah, both men were killed at approximately the same time. We've seen that before, Jethro. What is it you say about coincidence? Care to dance, Gibbs? Flores is smoking, here. First shot... hits him in the leg. He goes to take cover. Draws his weapon. Wounded, he takes a shot. More than one. Two bullets hit this tree, plus one in our second dead man's gut. Now we're both wounded. But I step out to take another shot. I'm hit, but you're hit worse. I step up, and I put one right in your heart. Considering you're about to die, that was a hell of a shot. Boss, second body is Luther Rake. Found his car down the road. According to our intel, he's low-level muscle for Siravo. He and Flores worked for the same guy. Not a coincidence. Siravo hired Rake to hit Flores. Flores hit back. Body count's rising fast. You're expecting one living guy. Instead, you find two dead guys. Both Siravo's. He sent Rake after Flores before we could pick him up. Only one way Siravo gets that kind of heads-up. We got a leak. Means Siravo knows we got Perry. I want to know who told him. Maybe we should start with your buddy Kort. He's not my buddy. Could have fooled me. I made some phone calls. Trent Kort's been benched. Siravo hasn't been on the CIA's radar in six months. What's Kort doing digging around in the trash? He's got his uses. Kort gave you my file. I'm only concerned about Siravo. What's Kort interested in? God and country. Trent Kort... shows up bearing gifts. I want to know what's in it for him. Trent Kort... does not gain anything by leaking information, Leon. Then I want to know who does. Find the leak. Find Siravo. I want the CIA out of my house. Must have hard water here. What are you looking at? Eat your free-range banana muffin. If Siravo could get to Flores, he'll be able to get to me. I'm a dead man for sure. Cool your jets, Perry. U.S. Marshals are on their way over to get you right now anyway. My immunity came through? Yeah. I wouldn't get too excited. You are gonna have to spill your guts to the U.S. attorney. Not a problem. Really? You're gonna have to pass a polygraph. There's gonna be a trial. You'll have to testify. You're going to be shuttling back and forth between these lousy safe houses for the next year. I've got an idea. Why don't you just tell us Siravo's account numbers? What do you mean lousy safe houses? Four bodies with a total of seven wounds. From seven bullets. Fired from four guns. All of which are in evidence. We have the means and the murderers. Each... body sings a different harmony to the same song. Yeah, like a barbershop quartet. Case closed. No, no. I was thinking more of... "Let the punishment fit the crime." Gilbert and Sullivan. Opera doesn't exactly translate to barbershop quartet. Of course, you would know that, being a lover of opera. And you a lover of the barbershop quartet? It was college. I was a tenor. We were known as the PB & Js. I was one of the Js. Yeah, really? Yeah, we modeled our look after the Dapper Dans of Disneyland. We had the vests, the sleeve garters. Yeah, the... the straw boater hats. Still have them at home. - We were good. - Well, the element... that makes barbershop music unique is called the fifth note. Yeah, a specific acoustical effect found in the harmony, also known as a ringing chord. Something you can only hear when all four voices sing together. Yeah. Something our quartet lacks. Something that only all four bodies could tell us in unison. We need a connection. Horse manure. Horse manure? Yes. We did find traces of a substance on their hands and under the fingernails of our dearly departed. Yeah. So did Abby, on their shoes. Well, perhaps that's our connection. Yeah, traces of horse manure on every one of them, suggesting all four were on a farm or ranch. According to the chemical breakdown of the manure... Same ranch. If all four men worked for Siravo, then it's safe to say that that ranch was a meeting place for his employees. Maybe even Siravo himself. Yeah, Duck, maybe. Thank you, gentlemen. Perfect... harmony. Tony, we have been compromised. What are you talking about? Is this a drill? Did she get my medicine? I'm going in the back. - Come here. Let's go. - What? What are you doing? Let's go, Perry! We got to go? We're more vulnerable in transit. Take cover. - What's she gonna do? - I don't really know. Bathroom now! Yeah. Gibbs. We have a situation at the safe house. Yeah, Ziva. What is it?</i> Just a second. Ziva, talk to me! Under control. You okay? Your medicine. You look like you need it. Stand down! U.S. Marshals! NCIS! Coming out! Here you go, gentlemen. He's all yours. - Thanks. - Let's go. That's a job well done. Abby, no one was hurt. Tony and Ziva are fine. They're not fine! Not as long as someone is leaking information. I mean, how else would Siravo have known about our meeting with Flores and that we had Perry? See? No one is safe until I find this leak. - Any luck? - No! There were no unusual outgoing calls from the NCIS switchboard. I ran all the phone numbers for everyone with knowledge of the crime: Gibbs, Tony, Ziva, you, me... home, cell and office. You ran your own home phone records? Yeah. Gibbs' orders. What about the Internet? There could be a virus or Trojan horse on the network. I already checked all incoming and outgoing network communications. All the firewalls are in place. The TCP servers are secure. If there's a leak, it's not coming from this building, - and I don't know where else to look. - Try this. Whose number is this? - Kort? - Run it. What do you got? Dashboard navigation systems from the two vehicles at the park. Tracking where Siravo's men have been. See if there was any common location. You mean, other than where they both died. Okay. Now, there's only one other location shows up in both nav systems. Put it up. 1314 Walnut Forest Road in Stafford County. That looks like stables. - It's a horse ranch. - Siravo's hideout. Grab DiNozzo, Ziva. Evidence garage in five. Looking for a fight, Gibbs? - We're looking for Siravo's crew. - What happened to the wiggler? Sterling's federal marshals' problem now. Need another gun? Actually, we're out of vests, but you can go commando if you want. - DiNozzo, get in the damn car! - Getting in the car, boss. Where are you going, Gibbs? Federal agents! Not much of the headquarters. Who is he? Face does look familiar. It should. Because it's on our wall. It's our criminal mastermind, Jonathan Siravo. In a topsy-turvy world where nothing is as it seems, the one place you can turn to is The Wall. Ran his prints, the coma man is, indeed, Jonathan Siravo. Yes, the Master of Pirates... Can't change his diapers, but running an international crime syndicate? That he can do in his sleep. You lied to me, Wall! We have half-a-dozen bodies downstairs, another nine floating on the other side of the world. Someone is responsible for them. You're responsible for a some of them. Someone else is responsible for the rest. Someone has built an empire using the name "Siravo" as a front. Yeah, to the tune of 300 million in illicit proceeds. That guy ever wakes up, he's going to be in for one hell of a surprise. Yeah, the best we can figure, Siravo never woke up from his coma - after his motorcycle accident. - Who's keeping him alive? - Who's paying the bills? - That's what I'm working on here. Private nursing care, medical equipment, horse ranch... Everything was well-funded until a couple days ago. When the first account was closed, its contents were funneled into various offshore accounts. It's like Perry said, "Consolidation and liquidation". Like everyone else involved, the money's also being taken out. All Siravo's accounts have been drained in the past 24 hours, but the transfers aren't being made from outside the banks. No passwords or serial numbers used, no requests for withdrawals came via any net portal... Someone's stealing the pirate's gold. It's not stealing. Seizing. Well, there's only a couple agencies that can do that: Homeland Security and... CIA. International banking laws. CIA can seize the assets of any suspected criminal or terrorist. Please don't tell me we're making Trent Kort a very rich man. - I need to see you. - All right, Abs. Be right there. Find Kort. Please, don't fire me, Gibbs. Or... or send me to jail. If I have a choice, I'd rather be fired. I think. For what? Aiding and abetting in a homicide. They played us like a fiddle, Gibbs. We were... fiddled. We didn't know what we were saying. The message went out to Flores, only it was in an open forum. So all Rake had to do was monitor it. The code. We got it wrong. "Hospital" didn't mean "emergency". It meant "send someone there". So, as far as Flores goes... We put out the hit. Hey, DiNozzo, tell me you got Kort. Well, didn't get far, less than three miles... - You're not going to like it. - Where? He just made a call. Triangulation shows him</i> at the U.S. Marshal's office at 500, Indiana.</i> Protection detail's transporting Perry <i>to the U.S. Attorney's office</i>. Start the car. Perry's the last loose end. - Kort's going to kill Perry? - No... No, he is not. - Hello, Gibbs. - <i>He drained</i> all of his accounts! Who, Siravo? There is no Siravo! He's been out of commission for years! Someone else must be running his operations. Yeah, and you know damn well who that is, don't you?! There's just two of us left in this mess. You listen to me, Kort! Nobody else dies today! Never expected you to turn him over to the marshals. All right, let's move. Stow him. Stop. Trent Kort, CIA. - The man you're transp... - The man is in our protection. We will use force if you don't stop. There's been a mistake. This man cannot be allowed to... CIA stole my money. I want it back, Mr. Kort. Every cent. Give me my money! You heard him, Kort. Give him his money. Come on, Perry. You're a numbers guy. How do you like these odds? You don't just drop a gun that's been recently fired. It could go off. - You okay? - Yeah. You really are a madman. You knew it was Perry? Well, I knew it wasn't me. So Perry was Siravo's accountant. Set up his living will after the motorcycle accident. Used power of attorney to access his holdings, and began building his network. All the while, the public face of the criminal empire would never be seen anywhere... but here, on The Wall. You're the real victim here, aren't you, Wall? You weren't after the pirate. You were after his treasure. Found his phony health fund and cleared it out. I didn't know he would take it so personally, but it seemed like an opportune time to cash in a favor. $300 million, I'd say you got your money's worth. CIA keeps it. And you get Siravo as promised. A major threat has been neutralized. You thought I was going to shoot him? Just there to get him back, that's all. Couldn't have him hide behind immunity now, could we? Bank robberies from bad guys. Is that how the CIA finances their operations? I'm just trying to get back in the starting lineup. It's possible you're even more dangerous behind a desk. Makes you feel any better, Gibbs, I owe you one. No. We're even. You know, the hardest part about coaching? It's watching from the sidelines. Yeah, it looks a little different from over there, doesn't it, Leon? What? You would have done things differently? I would. I do. But...
