Why me, Gibbs? Wasn't stopping one bullet enough for you? Why did l have to take two? l don't know. You don't know? Come on, Gibbs, what's that famous gut tell you? Why did l die instead of you? Found Ari's sniper's nest, boss. Roof of an abandoned office building to the east. Didn't police his brass. They're Lapua .308s. l didn't mean that you couldn't see that, boss. l can't without my glasses. Lapua's match-grade sniper ammo. You guys find any bullets? None that match the casings. l left three guys on the roof searching. McGee and l will go back to the roof, boss. Tony, you're soaking wet. Go put some dry clothes on. Ari's rooftop wasn't much higher than ours. Rooflines behind us were lower. No telling how far a full metal jacket bullet would go, after killing Kate. How's he know it's a full metal jacket? Didn't you see Kate? l didn't want to. Her head was intact. Oh, so she didn't look bad? No. No, not at all, Probie. ln fact, a little mortuary putty right here and she'll be good as new. Of course, she was having a bad hair day, though, right back here. A full metal jacket will put a hole the size of a grapefruit - right about there. - Tony. Please. Sorry, kid. Three rounds. Only one hit? He must've popped off a couple rounds when we were weaving across the roof. l was standing still when Kate was shot. McGee lasered the distance at nearly 600 metres. Five seventy-two. Slight shift in the wind, he misses you. He hits Kate. There was no wind. What are you saying? He was aiming at Kate? - You're the one he wants to kill. - Ari had a thing for Kate. What are you talking about? She told me that he was always coming on to her. ln Autopsy, when he kidnapped her and let her go. She never told me that. - Gee, what a surprise. - What? Don't do that, Tony. When was this hit, Tim? When l was pinned down. Ari have a shot at it? A car was between the terrorist and the controller. There's no way he could have hit it. l'm sorry. l should've realized that it was Ari. - Why didn't he pop McGee? - Oh, thanks, Tony. All l'm saying is you're a sizeable target. The controller isn't. - Are you saying l'm fat? - No. All right, maybe a little around the waist, under the chin. He didn't have an angle on Tim. You owe that shooter from the warehouse a thank-you. He saved your life. The bullet entered here. lt could have ricocheted into the car. l'll-- l'll get on it. - Abby should be in by now. - Tony, see what you can pull off that brass. l'm going for coffee. Can l get you boys some? - No. - No, thanks. That's a first. - He called me Tim. - He patted my back. lt's kind of nice. Nice? l don't want nice. He's not Gibbs if he's nice. You're a mess, girl. Red eyes. No makeup. lf ever there was a time for black lipstick, it's now. Remember when we first met? l couldn't believe you were a forensic scientist. l thought goths had bats for pets or vice-versa. l really liked you, Kate. A lot. Don't start that again. Where are your pigtails? l love you in pigtails. That's better. You were persistent, Abs. First, the dark lipstick. Then the black nail polish. Next thing you know, l have a tat on my bum. Oh, God. Ducky's gonna see it. l'm dead and l'm embarrassed. Abby. Hey, Tony. Are you okay? l will be as soon as l tie up my pigtails. There. What can l do for you? - What? - You're weirder than Gibbs. How so? He's being nice. Gibbs is always nice. To you and Ducky, maybe. Me, he growls at and smacks on the head. Which makes you feel wanted. Yeah. What do you got for me? .308 casings from Ari's sniper's nest. You would have to give me the most popular calibre in the world. Well, hey, l just found them. Can you tell what weapon he used? - A .308. - What model .308? - You don't know? - Would l be asking? - Well, how am l supposed to know? - Because you're the firearms expert. That l am. And when l'm done, l will tell you the propellant, the primer, the percentage of nickel and copper in the brass, whether or not all three rounds were fired from the same weapon which you assume, but l can prove or disprove. l will tell you who manufactured the ammo, the batch number and, perhaps, where it was sold. l will also, with some degree of accuracy, tell you if it was fired from a lever-action, a bolt-action, a semi-automatic or an automatic weapon. However, there is no way in hell l could tell you which of the 87 different .308 models fired those rounds. The rounds are Lapua. What? Lapua made the ammo. Logo's on the rim. Tony, l'm gonna miss her. Me too. - You hit? - No. - You're heavy. - Sorry. No wonder you're so heavy. Tony, you're all muscle. Abby: Packing a nice booty too. Hey, is this how you deal with getting shot at? - l don't know. lt's my first time. - Abby. Boss, down. We're taking fire. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Close off Anacostia Park between the bridges. - Tell Metro cops it's a crime scene. - Okay, right. What if he has a night-vision scope? That's a good point, boss. l will get you bullet-proof glass. - There's no such thing, Gibbs. - Okay, bullet-resistant glass. Ari didn't shoot at you and hit Kate by mistake, did he? He's after me now. l was walking by that window when he fired. You're just saying that to make me feel safe. l'll keep you safe, Abby. l promise. l appreciate your keeping me covered in front of the others. Especially Tony. Yes, l know how modest you are. Were. l'm dead now, Ducky. Shouldn't be. l could have killed Ari right here. ln Autopsy. Why did you hesitate? His eyes. There was something in his eyes that made me not wanna kill him. His eyes were ice to me. Ari fired into Abby's lab. Good Lord. lt had to come from across the river in Anacostia Park. Was Abigail hurt? No, she's a little shook up. Tony's with her. ln the lab? ln the squad room writing up an incident report. You should have brought in another M.E., Duck. Couldn't. Not for Caitlin. l've lost men in combat. You hope you won't. You know you will. - This is different. - But it shouldn't be. Kate was an agent. She knew she had to lay her life on the line. But you're right. lt's different. Well, you just said it. You've lost men. Have you ever lost a woman? Let's face it, Jethro, you and l are a couple of old chauvinists. Women will never be equal in our eyes until they're equal in death. Why, Ducky? Why Kate? Why not me? - Well, maybe he meant to hit you. - No. No, him sniping Abby means he's after my people. Women first. Then he's torturing you. One has to wonder what made him such a sadist. l don't give a damn. l just wanna kill the bastard. Hey, McGee, take a look at this. l think it's a .308. Stop staring at my butt and get me an evidence jar. Drop it. Oh, l found another one. Boss, we found a .308 slug. Two. They were plugged in the trunk. These fired by the dirtbag in the warehouse? Yes. Those l found in the right side of the car. Nine mil slugs. Ari missed with his first shot. Hit the controller with the second. Where were you before you took cover? Right here. Tony's right. You do owe that terrorist a thank-you. He didn't police his brass again. Metro P.D. found a .308 casing in the park next to tyre tracks. - And? - Nothing. l was waiting for you to tell me to tell them to bring the evidence. l have to tell you that, DiNozzo? You always do. - Tell Metro P.D. to-- - Already did, boss. Oh, and by the way, the director wants to see you up in MTAC. Why are you baiting Gibbs? l'm trying to get him to stop being nice. l like him nice. Signal is strong. We have a solid channel. Distributing the infrared-- What do you have? Brass from Ari's sniper's nest. Three bullets. Tyre tracks in Anacostia Park from where he fired a shot across the river into our forensics lab. Unusual for a sniper not to police his brass, isn't it? - Yes, sir. - l've received calls from every director l know promising to hunt down this sniper as if he'd killed one of their own. FBl might be the most help. Ari Haswari is their mole. l endorsed your recommendation to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Special Agent Todd. - Thank you, sir. - According to your after-action report, no one actually saw the sniper who killed Agent Todd. Ari was on a rooftop 600 metres away. - Extraordinary shot. - No, sir. Not really. - You were a sniper with the Corps? - Two tours. Vietnam? l'm not that old, sir. Panama and Desert Storm. - l thought you were older. - Target vehicle approaching. We have a hard lock. Target confirmed. Engage. Weapon free. Good lock. On target. Well done. Good job, everyone. Where was l? Avoiding using Ari's name and the word ''sniper'' in the same sentence, sir. Your anger is understandable, Jethro. You lost an agent. - You want payback. - Don't you, sir? lt's a passion l can't afford. Do you honestly think it wasn't Ari? No. But there are those who do. Those who ran him. Those who thought they had the holy grail of moles. Those people covering their asses right now. Make sure you cover yours when you bring him in. Won't be a problem, sir. l won't be bringing him in. Anyway, you're not my problem anymore, Jethro. You firing me, sir? l've been offered a deputy director's position at Homeland Security. You'd leave NClS, sir? Well, the agency could use some younger blood. Well, who'll be replacing you, sir? Not me. Much as l like you, Jethro, l would not shoot NClS in the head. He's your problem now, director. Hello, Jethro. Should we skip the ''you haven't changed a bit'' bull? Why start lying to each other now, Jen? Any problem taking orders from me? As director or as a woman? Either. lt was six years ago. The past won't be a problem. You were a damn good agent especially undercover. Jethro. Madam Director. You have no physical evidence linking Ari to the shootings. No wonder agencies here and abroad have doubts. Bastard killed one of my people. He's trying to kill more. l'll tell you something else. No suit with a tight sphincter is getting in my way, and that includes you, Jen. Special Agent Gibbs. On the job, it is Director Shepard or ma'am. Okay. What about off the job? There won't be any ''off the job,'' Agent Gibbs. That's too bad. l missed you, Jen. Don't make this difficult, Jethro. Fair enough. lt won't happen again. Director. We can continue this conversation in private. l've gotta change my clothes. We can talk in my car. - Gibbs. - Hey, l got a dead agent and a sniper on the loose. l do not have 1 0 minutes to spare. Tony, where are we? McGee and Abby are working firearms analysis. - l'm matching tyre tracks to vehicles. - No one is to leave the building. McGee's on protection detail with Abby. l'll be back in an hour. Your mother should have washed your mind out with soap. Gibbs leaves with a woman and your only thought is: nooner. Was not. Was too. l've always known what you were thinking, Tony. What? What are you up to? Tony, l just died and you're having a sexual fantasy? Can't help it. DiNozzo. Sometimes l used to picture you naked. l'll call you back. Hi. l was just-- Having phone sex? Phone sex? No. - Charades. - Charades? - Like: -You've played. Never on the telephone. Yeah. My partner and l were coming up with quotes for Saturday night. You play charades on Saturday night? To kill time before l go clubbing. Who are you? Ziva David. Mossad. You're lsraeli? Very good. The way you made that connection. Mossad, lsraeli. What can l do for you, Ms. David? Nothing. l'm here to see Special Agent Gibbs. How do you know l'm not Gibbs? - Gibbs. - He'll be back in an hour. Are you sure l can't help you? l don't think so. We got off to a bad start. l'm Special Agent Tony DiNozzo. l wasn't playing charades. l was remembering my partner. - Naked? - No. Yes. l-- l was just-- Look, l'm not the only man who does it. Oh, women do it too. With handsome men. And even an occasional woman. Now you're teasing me. Didn't your partner tease you? Not about sex. Kate was kind of puritanical. - Sorry. - Well, it didn't matter. l wasn't interested in her. We were partners. She wasn't attractive? She was, but not to me. Then why did you imagine her naked? Miss David, you can sit there and slouch provocatively for an hour if you'd like, or you could tell me what you need and maybe l can help. You can't help because l'm here to stop Special Agent Gibbs from killing a Mossad officer. Ari Haswari? Yes. l'd wish you luck, but l want the bastard dead too. ls this the same boat you were building six years ago? - Nope. - What happened to it? - l burned her. - Why would you--? You named it after an ex-wife. Let's go. - Which one? - You know damn well which one. - Why didn't you change the name? - Because it wouldn't matter. Every time l went out on her, l'd think of Diane. You could have sold it. And watched some other guy sail off on her? You didn't care who sailed off on Diane. Leroy Jethro Gibbs, you are a strange man. Me. You were a good agent, Jen. - Were? - Yeah. Director's job is pure politics. l'm good at politics. NClS needs someone who can shake the money tree on the Hill and work with sister agencies. Wait, you won't call a boat a ''she,'' but it's ''sister agencies?'' l'm a schizoid libber. lt comes from working with chauvinists like you. l can't believe you would give up field work for rubber chicken dinners. l don't think they serve that dish at Palena. - Never heard of it. - Why would you? lt isn't takeout. So which of the tight sphincters is taking you out to dinner? Please tell me it's not Fornell. CBS <i>Early Show</i>. They want background before l go on TV. Jen. Jen, you can't do that. Excuse me? Ari is a chauvinist. He is taking out the women l work with before me. Jethro. People who should know don't believe Ari Haswari is the sniper. And you haven't provided any evidence to prove them wrong. Have you ever doubted me? Professionally? Never. Why are you doubting me now? l have to establish a working relationship with these people. Who are you gonna side with, Jen? Them or me. Give me a tough question. What is with this music? l'm playing it out of respect for Kate. l thought you were from New Orleans. - So? - Well, don't they play jazz at funerals? Coming from the cemetery after the body has been buried. On the way to the cemetery, we play a dirge. - Do you know what a dirge is, Timmy? - Creepy music? Go back to the squad room and let me do my job. l can't. Why? Gibbs-- Gibbs told me to watch over you. That is so sweet. - You're from a wealthy family. - Really? Born and raised on the East Coast. New England boarding school. Spent some time in the Midwest. And Philadelphia. How would you know that? Shalom, Jen. Shalom. Did l miss it? - Yes, you did, but we didn't. - You first. Ziva David, Mossad. She's here to stop you from whacking Ari. Yours? Director Jenny Shepard. Same mission. Which agency? Ours. Yeah? Special Agent Gibbs. Ziva David, Mossad. Ziva. Director Shepard has spoken often of you. - Really? - Ziva and l worked antiterrorist ops since 9/1 1 . You saw one today in MTAC. That was yours? l only acquired the intel. Excuse me. Yes, l really am the new NClS director. Yeah. Good to have you back, boss. Shalom. Miss David, whose balls get cut off if Ari is not a Mossad mole, but a terrorist? Mine, l suppose. Since l'm his control officer. They promote control officers young in Mossad. Have to. The good ones are dead at your age. Do you know how l located Ari's terrorist cell? GPS fix off his encrypted cell phone. He wanted you to know the terrorists' location, so you could stop the missile instead of him, which would've blown his cover. Only an NSA satellite can GPS an encrypted phone. Ari didn't know l had that asset. You give him less credit than he gives you. Who hung up first? You or him? Ari knows a fix takes only 1 9 seconds. When Sharon visited Bush, Ari's Hamas cell kidnapped Agent Todd. Why didn't he kill her instead of freeing her to warn the Secret Service? Why don't you arrange a meet and he can tell me? Ari Haswari is a Mossad operative undercover in Hamas. He hasn't turned on us or you. He didn't kill Agent Todd. Gibbs, even if you're right, we owe them proof. That's all we ask. - Don't kill the wrong man. - Like Mossad did in Norway? That mistake cost us dearly. Not as dearly as the Palestinian waiter you killed. Ziva, assure your deputy director that even though Ari Haswari is a suspect, no action will be taken unless we have evidentiary proof. Proof before action. You were my sweet superhero, Kate. You're a naughty boy, Timmy. Oh, my God. l'm becoming Tony. Wow, what? l-- l-- Stop ''ah-uming,'' McGee. Spit it out. l-- l was thinking about Kate. Me too. l kind of still feel like she's here, you know? l want you on Ziva's ass. She's not really my type, boss. - To tail her. - l knew that. She's been in contact with Ari. That's the only way she could know l hung up on him. - l don't want you to get pissed-- - l thought you wanted me pissed? l did. lt was kind of weird when you were being nice. Not that you're not nice. l mean-- Will you spit it out, DiNozzo? What if Ziva's right and Ari knew you'd trace the call? Maybe he wasn't the sniper. She is right. Ari wanted me to raid the warehouse. He set me up. And it cost Kate her life. ls he a mole or a terrorist? Whatever works to play his game. lf Ziva leads me to Ari? Shadow him and call me. - So you can bring him in? - Yeah. So l can bring him in to Autopsy. The FBl database gave me six weapons whose rifling patterns fit the bullets you recovered. l've been able to eliminate all but three. Two SWAT weapons, the Tango 51 and Bravo 51 . - And this-- - My old friend. A Marine M40A1 sniper rifle. lt looks sweet the way you hold that, boss. Sweet? Yeah. lt's an expression that means-- Yeah, l know what it means, McGee. You think Ari looked sweet when he shot Kate? Of course not, boss. My vote is for the Tango or Bravo 51 s. What do you think, Gibbs? Your test rounds show more gouging than Ari's. He was hand loading and moly coating. You are so good. - ''Moly coating''? - Yeah. Molybdenum disulfide. lt's a lubricant. lt decreases barrel wear and increases accuracy. McGee, run a trace on Tango and Bravo 51 sales. Last six weeks. Tri-state area. - Check the Bravo first. - On it, boss. Any prints on the brass? No. ls your gut telling you something? Yeah. l need coffee. No, Gibbs. Come on. This isn't just another investigation. Todd was your agent, but Kate was my friend. So can you stop it with the John Wayne stare - and tell me what your gut says? - What don't l believe in, Abby? UFOs, mystics, coincidence, saying you're sorry, excuses. l could go on all night. As a Marine sniper, l used hand-loaded Lapua .308 boat-tail full metal jacket, moly-coated bullets. Gibbs. You know what a sniper calls a Bravo 51 ? No. A Kate. My shoulder hurts when it rains, too, Gerald. Good night, Kate. Autopsy. Hello, Dr. Mallard. Gerald. How are you, my dear fellow? l've been better. - Oh, what's wrong? - <i>He's having flashbacks.</i> - Well, who are you? - <i>Oh, l'm hurt.</i> You don't recognise my voice? You bastard. You do remember me. lf you harm Gerald-- l have no intention of harming Gerald. l think one ruined shoulder is enough. lt certainly is for me. What do you want? A professional courtesy, one doctor to another. Yes, well, l'd be most willing to provide a free autopsy. Dr. Mallard, l want to prove l didn't kill Caitlin. By taking Gerald hostage? Gerald is free to go if you'll listen - <i>to my side of this tragedy.</i> - l'm listening. lt's a long story and l'd hate to have somebody trace this call. Well, no one is here but me. And Caitlin. lt must have been a difficult autopsy for you. l'm truly sorry, doctor. Will you get on with it? Will you meet me alone? What happens to Gerald? Come alone and you can exchange places. Doctor, don't come. He'll kill you. Learn to trust, Gerald. l may have shot you in the shoulder. But l've never lied to you. Doctor? You have my word. Thank you. Re-evaluating your convictions? How many times did you tell me there's no such thing as a coincidence? Jethro? l know it's been a difficult day for both of us. That's what my Dl used to say. Never believed him. Jen... Are you going to dinner with CBS? l am. Don't do that interview. Please. l'll see if l can delay it a few days. Good. Good night, Jethro. Night. Ducky. How nice to see you again. And you. Congratulations. - Going home? - Yes. Ducky. So are you back at work, Gerald? Next week. l've always found that work is the best-- A vintage Morgan. How Ducky. Flash your lights.
