But no arrests. I'll make some calls. A name keeps popping up in my interviews. Hernan. Hernan is undercover in the salvadoran organization. Stop trying to contact him. Hey, Moses! I thought we told you to stay away from between her pussy. You're gonna stop seeing that asshole. I know. So this guy targets runaways. While telling them to go home. There's another girl. Came in 6 months ago. We didn't believe her. Congratulations on getting another girl ass raped. Anything you can tell us... Where he held you? It was a girl's room. Posters on the wall were all white boys in these gay poses. This Kevin Hiatt is ours starting next week. You're not adding anybody to my team that I don't have approval of. He's not your addition. He's your replacement. Hiatt's decided to add another member to the Strike Team. I suggested you. All right. Shane? Lem, I'm sorry! But I had to, right? We're gonna find out who did this. And we're gonna kill him. It's Guardo. He stepped on his protection plate twice. You know, maybe he didn't do it, man! If it wasn't Guardo, who was it?! Well, let's get him, man! Found him swirling in a gutter. Conscious? In and out. Contusions, possible fractures. Vitals are stable. Put him in curtain two. All right. Call the resident to check for internal bleeding. Better tell him to hurry. Thought you said he was stable. He is, but we found this. He's a cop. Shane? Corrine, what the hell happened? He was beaten pretty badly and doesn't remember how. Where? When? They found him a few blocks from here. Oh, man. No shit from you guys. Already took one pounding today. What happened? I was walking to my truck, next thing I know I'm coming to in a meat wagon. You didn't see anyone? Left my wallet. Badge, gun. Think it might've been the salvadorans? Some lame ass attempt at one of us? Payback for Guardo? We wouldn't be having this conversation. This was just a good old-fashioned shit-kicking. It was probably some asshole we sent up, fresh out. I'll run down recent releases, check in with the P.O.'s. Tell me something first... Who's this guy? New girlfriend likes baby smooth skin between her thighs. You should have her call me. Oh, my god. What happened? What the doctors say? The X-rays are all good. I'll get working on who did this. Baby, what happened to you? Transcript : Swsub.com Synchro : Artusamak Haunts How's Shane doing? Hurting for certain. Not especially pleasing to the eye at the moment. I'm going to post a protective detail outside his room until we know more. What do you know about the San Marcos house murders? I heard about them. Grisly stuff. Yeah. Robbery homicide's running with it. We got the hand-off. Aceveda's all over this. 10 days ago my detective found 12 bodies, hacked to pieces. Well, 11 bodies, one arm. Machete's the weapon of choice for the salvadorans. Which supports the tip that Aceveda's cronies gave us, that the killers were el salvadorians, the victims were all mexican illegals. 3 women, 9 men. I.d.'s? All but the arm. Mexican government had them in their system. If you can call that a system. The men were all from the same prison. Released 2 days before the bodies were found. It's all in the there. This becomes the Strike Team's top priority now. Solving it quickly is the difference between keeping the barn open or closing it for good. They're shutting this place down? Not if you put a dozen murders in the win column. Make our closure rate too good-looking to lose us. Get with Dutch. He found the bodies. Uh, the barn going out of business stays between us. Last thing Farmington needs is cops who feel like lame ducks. Alright. Let's have a look at it. Give me a sec? So far, no one on the street's bragging about giving Shane a beat down. All right. Well, have the units keep their eyes and ears open. What, man? Guardo's girlfriend... She could've figured out we used her to get him, told his people... Maybe the salvadorans are after us. I don't think so, man. Shane got hit with a fist, not a machete or a grenade. Let's go. RHD's pretty thorough. They give us a starting place with the victims? Like she said. Released from a prison in Sinaloa. Connections to the same mexican cartel. All with guest worker visas. Let me see that. Prisoners don't get work visas. Especially not real ones. A- plus forgeries then. Where do you want me to start, jefe? It's either give you a hand or be out on the street, right? I've still got some drag at I.N.S. so I'll get them to run a quick I.D. on the arm. But you know these streets better than anyone. Where do you want to start? With the visas. You know anyone that does that quality of work? I might know a guy. By the way, welcome to the team. Won't let you down. He's the boss now. Don't let him down. Let's go. Graciela sanchez is getting out of mission cross today. How are we doing iding her rapist? Billings is pounding the pavement with the sketch Princess gave us. The feds are running the profile I came up with through their database for potential unsubs. Contact the local y's, teen shelters... I did it, I did it. No one's gotten back to me yet. Stay on top of them. Our guy's M.O.'s escalating. Wouldn't surprise me if he's already got a fresh victim. Oh, my god. What are you doing? Details of the crime scene, create a written report for the files on this case. Who wants what and why and how slaughtering all those people in this room helped achieve that goal. That's all you need to be writing down, man. Hey, hey. I don't want to be here. Too bad. 12 people. 3 of them women. Cut to pieces in this place 10 days ago. I read about it in the paper. I didn't need to see it. They were carrying these. Only one guy I know good enough to produce this kind of work and that's you. I changed careers. If not you, then who? I couldn't say. Paper men, we have a code. You got a code. You the blood on these walls? Huh? You see it? You have no idea the pressure to point the finger at someone for this. No matter how bogus that I.D. Look again. I-I can tell you these were done in mexico, not here. Hiatt: How can you be so sure? The font. T-they use an older version. It's almost the same, but not quite. Mexicans and the sals, troubled times. Latinos can't even trust each other these days. Wait outside. Brown and Brown, it's a place to start. Body count like this, the aztecs and mayans are squabbling over more than who invented the burrito. So let's start with the salvadorans. Thank you, sheriff. Didn't expect to see your grenade tossing ass for at least another 30 years. Tejado: Oh, it's your lucky day. Oh, Guardo's number 2 has arrived. Why are your old amigos beefing with the mexicans? Day trip for me, but you wasted your time. Get your feet down! I'm just enjoying the air. What's it gonna take to make it worth my time? Look, I want to know if Guardo or any other salvadorans were behind the San Marcos murders. You get one request. I deny it, that's it, you're back in your hole. But if it's something reasonable... I want my dick sucked by a hottie. Right here on the table. Thought it was gonna be something difficult. Alright. Info first, dick suckin' next. OK. They killed Guardo. The mexicans. When? He came back to LA a week ago. Bam bam. Just disappeared. Explains why we can't find him. Guardo works for the cartel. Why the bad blood? Yo no se. Hey, that dick ain't gonna suck itself. That's the straight-up truth. Beaners the ones started this beef. Salvas gonna finish it. So, Guardo's MIA, presumably dead, you're wearing orange. Who's gonna take up the fight? It's been worked out in upper management. Octavio... Rodrigo... Hernan... I know the first two. Who's this hernan? New guy. Wants to be the shot caller. If he's such a player, how come he's a mystery man to me? Just here from Salvador. Yeah? Where? Hey! What about my hummer? Asher. Come here. You're considered a hottie in certain circles, right? Damn straight. Why? This is Tejado. He's got a special request for you. Yeah? What's that? Yeah, that was Moses. The one-niner ball? Yeah, he's got some intel on Shane. I know this is the first priority, though. Wyms wants you on a short leash. So don't go walking into traffic, make me look bad. Your friend Graciela's been released from the hospital. You know she was raped. Who's Graciela? According to the girls at the Rec Center, you 2 are pretty tight. How long you been on the street? By law we're required to send runaways back home. But if you cooperate, tell us everything you know about Graciela... And promise to go back home on your own, We'll take you at your word. I haven't seen her lately. Any strange men ever followed her around? Acting suspicious toward her? There's this one guy at Ray's who was creeping us out. The burger stand on Wilcox? J.B. We'd smile, he'd give us free burgers and shit. Ever feel sick after J.B. feeds you? No. Why? According to the girls you were quite friendly. Giving them free food. They're lying. I never did that. 'cause if you stole from your employer, that's a parole violation. You homesick for the joint, J.B.? Look, maybe I talked to them once or twice. Gave 'em leftovers. So? Talking to them's one thing. Spiking their soda with GHB, sodomizing and torturing them's another. I didn't do that shit. It's gotta be tough to meet a nice girl your age. Ex-con, pulling minimum wage. But a homeless, hungry 15-year-old runaway, Easy to impress with a burger and fries. Hey, hey, it's cool, it's cool. You better pray you didn't hurt that foot sticking it up a white cop's ass. Easy, dude. I'm rocking a pimp stick 'cause I'm cold like that. You got something to say about Shane? Start talking. You remember Tilli? That chick I was with the last time we met. What, that 12-year-old you're sticking? She's 18 and old enough for your boy to be tapping that ass behind my back. You expect us to believe Shane is banging that chick? That's what I said. Only reason I brought y'all down is because y'all gonna have reason to think I beat him down. Riding up in your girl's steeze works as motive for me. I ain't hit that shit in a minute. And I ain't about no sloppy seconds. Word, I did not take flight on your boy. Not that I would a minded. Then who did? Ask the l'il ho. Seem like she all about telling the white man what he wanna hear. Hey, I'm Detective Wagenbach. Carlos Morganza. Children's beacon. The runaway shelter on Western. You sent out an alert to us? Thanks for coming in. You're actually the first person to get back to me. Well, when I heard what happened to those girls, I put together a list of the kids I thought were most at risk. You know, drugs, prostitution. Is there any way we can confirm which of these kids have been seen and which haven't in the last 24 hours? I'll do what I can. Thanks for coming in. Oh, um, my daughter sabrina went missing. It's been 3 years now. Her case got cold, the police had other priorities. If you could take a look. When I get a chance, absolutely. - Thank you. - Thank you. Just take it easy. A little slower. Hey. Sorry. Jesus. We're gonna find out who did this. How ya doing? You just saw the only part of him that's not bruised. The Captain sent me over here to take a statement. I already told Vic everything that happened. Yeah. Well, I also have orders to park myself out here as your protective detail. I'll be fine. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I got orders. I'll be right outside. Thanks. You got it? OK. Feds faxed over some suspects that fit your profile. Anything turn up at J.B.'s place? No signs he placed prison runaways. It's a fourth floor walk-up. He'd have to take his victims up 4 flights of stairs. Paper thin walls. Hard to believe he could do that without somebody noticing. Good luck. Detective Wagenbach. Carlos. Detective Billings, Carlos Morganza. He's a counselor at the children's beacon. I got involved about 3 years ago when my own daughter went missing. I'm sorry to hear that. Listen, my colleagues and I checked into that list of high-risk kids like you asked. These are the names of the ones we've lost touch with most recently. This is great. Thank you. Sure. Listen, I can run through them with you. You know what? I'm in the weeds right now, but if you can sit at my desk, I can get a uni to take notes. Oh. Sure. Thank you. Dutchman. Remind me again your profile of our bad guy. Why, so you can shit all over it? No, I'm serious. Uh, he's a single father, whose daughter disappeared or died prematurely. What kind a douche bag breaks his ass for no reason trying to help the cops? He's got a missing... Right? A lot of these freaks like to insert themselves into investigations. Uh, you know what, Carlos, I think I can make time for you right now. Claudette Wyms. This is Cruz Pezula. I wanted to introduce Cruz to the new Captain. More like the fresh meat in Farmington. Hello. It's a pleasure. What's the latest on the San Marcos massacre? I'm sorry. Are you with the police committee as well? No, I'm not. I can vouch for Cruz. He's well respected in the community. In fact, he's the one who passed on that information about the possible salvadoran connection. I know a lot of people who are devastated by this new level of violence. As are we all. Claudette has the committee's full support. How many Detectives you got on it? It's the entire Strike Team. Mackey, too? Kevin Hiatt's taking point. He was with INS 4 years. The victims are all mexican nationals... He's more than qualified. I should hope so. Could you give us a minute? Of course. Don't ever ambush me like that again. He has concerns. I share them. I don't care how plugged in to your constituency that guy is. Bringing a civilian into a confidential police matter undermines the investigation and my authority. I meant no disrespect. But perhaps you wouldn't be taking it so personally if you had more facts to share. I'm sorry, Captain. I didn't know you were in here. Would it be OK if we used this room to talk to Mr. Morganza? No. I'm in the middle of something with the councilman. I'm sorry to bother you. Would it be all right if we talked in interrogation? It's a little less personal. Sorry. - Sure. Yeah. No problem. - OK. Hey, Tilli! Get over here! Yo, why you calling me out in front of my peoples? I'm a cop. I hear you like cops. That some sort of code or something? I know about you and Shane. He's in the hospital. - What for? - Somebody jumped him. I figured you could tell us who. Wait. He caught a smackdown? Is he a'ight? I want to go see him. Which hospital? His wife's with him right now. I'll say I'm a friend. Shane doesn't have too many teenage black friends. How'd you get this? My stepdad. Your stepdad know you're spreading your legs for Shane? He got pretty angry. I told him it wasn't his business. And if he tried to stop it, or put his hands on me again, Shane would kick his ass. Where's he at now? Hell if I know. Where's he work? He don't. He about that monthly check from the county. Look, if he did that to Shane, what do you think he's gonna do to me the next time I see him? You stay away from the hospital and stay away from your old man. I'll take care of him. Corrine, that percocet's not working. I'll ask the resident for something stronger. Thanks. Listen, before I forget, these are his personal items, including his car keys... One of the unis removed the bullets from his gun. Those things scare the hell out of me. Thanks. Can you give us a minute, please? Sure. Thanks. God damn you! How could you? Shit! Jesus! What? Why do you need condoms when I'm 3 months pregnant? They must have been from before. Mara, I'm not doing anything, baby. I swear. Son of a bitch. Yes, you are! Does it have anything to do with the reason why you're here? Does it? Oh, no. Mara, it's nothing. It's nothing. It's not important. Look, I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've just... I've been all twisted up. I'm, I'm. You? This is us, OK? Our family. You threw it away. And for what? I've been trying to help you through all of this, you waking up screaming, and then you're out... Oh, I can't believe you! Jesus! This is for the pain. When sabrina first went missing, everyone pitched in to help find her. Friends, neighbors, my church. But after a while, people go back to their routines.</i> Life goes on. Even the police move on to other business. But she's still out there. We appreciate you helping. All I can say is, as a parent myself, it's gotta be awful. Your heart breaks all over again every day you don't hear from her. There are 15 kids on your list. Is there any one you feel is a particular risk to this predator? Oh, probably... Rosanna. She had a pimp. Had his claws in her. Once that happens, it sets up a whole victim mentality and that's an open invitation. When was the last time anyone saw her? 2, 3 weeks ago. Dutch? Kevin Hiatt. New here. Yeah, I know. Welcome. Thanks. Hey, listen. We're running with the San Marcos house murders. I was just wondering if you had any files I should see? Uh, yeah. Give me a few minutes, I'll get them together. Sure. Cool. Hey, listen. What do you know about a guy named Hernan? Um... Come here. He's a Fed'. He's undercover in the salvadoran organization. So, how do I get in touch with him? You don't. I tried. Female fed showed up on my door at midnight saying she's Hernan's handler and to back the hell off. What agency? I.C.E. So don't waste your time. Well, it's my time to waste, right? What's his handler's name? Vic Mackey! Jesus Christ. The ghost of christmas past! You're looking good, man. For an old guy. I see them baldness cures still ain't for shit. Oh, watch it. Hey, I heard about your guy. Curtis was a good kid. Well, none of us get outta this place in one piece, right? Yeah. I was away for the funeral. Is there some sort of a charity or police memorial fund or something? Audubon society. Lem was really into birds, turns out. OK. Things really turned around for you, looks like. Yeah. You know, I got my feet underneath me. Doing pretty good. It took a minute, but I'm doing pretty good. Look, I got a business proposition for you. Look, rain check, man. I got 12 D.B.'s, no suspect. My partner took a beating. Not only am I flying solo, I gotta locate who did it and return the favor. Come on, Vic. You helped me through a rough patch, man. I'm just trying to, you know, pay back the kindness. Come on, come on. Take a ride with me. I'll have you back in 30. You're living large, driving around in a high-end pussy magnet like this. Only now I got a 26-year-old filipina I gotta keep in Gucci. The buzz is you're getting squeezed out. Maybe without a pension. I'm not getting squeezed out. And nobody's got their hand in my pocket either. What's the job? Citizen, east LA., he owns an apartment building. Wants to spruce it up and raise the rents. Only there's this undesirable element camped out there. So the landlord wants to hire a cleaning crew. Jamaican dope operation's got the run of the place, terrorizing Lieutenants. Can't evict 'em, long as the rent's on time. Need a little hand persuading them to move elsewhere, man. My plate's pretty full right now. Vic, there's families living in this place. There's little kids riding their bikes next to these dope deals going down. The landlord's paying good money, too, right? Cash. All right? Half up front. Look, man, just scope it out. If it looks good to you, having a real badge around'll make this thing go a lot smoother. Besides, I can't do it without you. Let's look. Yeah. Come on! Come on! Spotter. Embedded with innocents. Glad I was wrong about your getting shoved out. It's a shitty way to go. Everybody knows you got a raw deal. It was goddamned embarrassing. I mean, you shit blood for 'em, then you don't get to leave on your own terms. Hope you never have to go through that. Yeah. There's security. Yeah, and probably 2 more upstairs. Cashier guy, one at the door. I'm gonna take a pass on this, Joe, and whether you realize it or not, you should do the same. You don't understand. Vic, this is my only paycheck this month. I really gotta get going back. Can you at least run priors on this place, let me see what level asswipe I'm dealing with here? Yeah, sure. It's Rosanna. She had a pimp. Had his claws in her. Once that happens, it sets up a whole victim mentality, and that's an open invitation. Is that him, baby? I'm sure that's his voice. You're positive? I was pretty out of it, but if there's a voice I'll never forget, it's his. Entrance off the alley. Yeah, he pulls up, takes the victims inside without anyone seeing. Yep. Hope your profile didn't say anything about him being a neat freak. You wouldn't want a cleaning lady coming around if you were holding a girl prisoner. Dutch. Rosanna? Sabrina's room. Concert poster Princess rembered. What 15-year-old keeps her room this neat? The mess in the rest of the house, he's letting go, falling apart, in here, he's preserving her memory, or an idealized version of it anyway. God, and what a clean-up job. Shampoo, wax. I wouldn't count on any hair fibers. Yeah. We talked to Tilli. Her old man got the drop on me. It's nothing. It's just a thing... - Jesus Christ, Shane. - Like no one in this car's ever had a little outta bounds ass before. This is an 18-year-old girl, who's bedded down with the head of the one-niners. She's done with him. Ask her. You saying this is about more than getting laid? Look, everything's cool. She just shot off her mouth about us to the dickhead stepdad and I got blindsided. Yeah, I can see that. Might wanna raise the mistress bar a little bit. If you still want a wife and kid to come home to. You ever think about just coming clean? About everything? No. Yeah, I know. I guess we just have to live with it. All right. It's dealer's choice on the stepdad. Either Ronnie and I can take care of him tonight, or wait until you're strong enough to join in. No. No, just let it go. This guy knowingly laid hands on a cop. This isn't just about your bruised ego. There's a principle. Look, I don't want you to do anything, please? I got enough to deal with. Mara? Mara? Mara. Mara? Mara, come on. Look, this is stupid. Mara, please, just open the door. Some black bitch called on your phone. She wanted to know if you were OK. She sounded like she was 10. Is that who you're banging while I got morning sickness? - Mara. - Just... You've always been an asshole. Mara, please, I just... Yeah, I know, you're all torn up over Lem. Get out. I don't want our son or the new one growing up anywhere near you. Get out! OK. What's up? My guy at INS I.D.'d the arm from the San Marcos house. Eduardo Romero. That supposed to mean something? Romero's a mid-level bureaucrat in the mexican government. Presidential appointment. Traveling around with a bunch of drug-connected convicts? One of their own officials. This guy should have been the first one the mexican government would've I.D.'d. So why didn't they tell us? Could embarrass a lot of powerful people on both sides of the border. That's right. Huh. Stop! No notes. This doesn't exist for anybody but us right now. The captain asked for an update. You heard what I said. - What am I supposed to do... - Hey, no report. This is raw intel. We don't even know where it leads yet. The difference between the units and the Strike Team is you don't hand your superior pieces of a puzzle, you hand them the whole picture. Sorry to keep you waiting so long. We talked to local pimps, put unis out on the street trolling the places where you said Rosanna works. In the meantime, are there any other places you can think of we should look? Not really. Think hard. Sometimes we can locate kids just from personal information about them. Kinda movies they like, where they eat, music they listen to. Yeah. I mean, you show me a kid's room, and I can tell you their life story. You searched my house, didn't you? Why would we do that? You looked in my daughter's room. You won't find anything there. We've got two witnesses that can I.D. you as the rapist. They recognize your voice and they rember the poster in your daughter's room. My lawyer'll have me out of here before your shift ends. I'll be home before you guys. You want to find your daughter, right? Right? You tell us what we want to know, I will personally re-open her case and do everything I can to find her. You want answers? All right. I'll give 'em to you but only in front of a news reporter. I want Sabrina's story aired on tv. I won't let you all bury her away again. Couple 211's, possession. One of 'em caught an "F" for ag assault. Mostly minor stuff. If you round up a few more guys... I'm sorry to leave you hanging. Oh, no worries. My buddy's waiting outside. We can handle this. Lotta ghosts in this place, man. Every day is Halloween. I'll walk you out. Goddamn freeway. This city's turning into a third world shitbag. This is Lester. Vic Mackey. Know you by reputation. I haven't been south of pico or east of the 110 since I turned the badge in. Yeah. Well, this'll be good exercise for you then, huh? Maybe you should take a couple more bodies with you on this one, Joe. Afro-humps'll be so stoned they won't even know what hit them. These guys seem like they're on their game. One of them caught a weapons charge recently. Trust me. Raids like this, I used to do in my sleep. Literally. Hey, Joe. Yeah? You still need a wingman? I'll have you back here in a hour. So, what's your shot in all this? Punishing these girls for running away, get back at your own kid for disappearing? If it gets one girl to go home, back to her parents... That's a gift I was never given. These girls were only anally penetrated. This wasn't about pleasure. It was punishment. Thing I'm having trouble understanding is how putting these girls through hell was going to get your daughter back? Well, you people gave up looking for her, didn't you? 3 measly goddamn months of investigating you just gave up. Look, I'm responsible, too. I could've made it easier for her. But without her mother... Wait. Why did she leave? Look, I've told you my story. Find her. She's been missing for 3 years. You know what, I may have to rework the rapist's profile, Steve, because our suspect is beginning to look like a person of interest in a murder investigation. I didn't kill Sabrina! My own daughter? Look, she's alive. I just can't find her myself. You're still not telling us the whole truth. The deal's off unless you come a hundred percent clean. You didn't kill her? Why'd she leave? Give me the videotape and get out. Give me the video. No, no. OK, OK. No, I'll tell you. Just make her turn the camera off first. Turn it off. Sabrina's mother died when she was 9. Hodgkin's disease. Sabrina never got over it. I mean... Neither of us did. She began to look... More and more like Carly. When I'd... When I'd hold her in my arms in bed at night, it was... Almost like my wife was still with me. I don't think Sabrina understood just how much like her she was. In every way. You molested your daughter? Turn the camera back on, please. Sabrina, honey, if you hear this... I never meant to hurt you. Oh, Jesus. I never meant to be so selfish. Come back home. Please. Lester: How long does it take to cop? Spook gives the money, spook gets the dope. Been in there for 20 minutes. With brothers, goddamn handshakes can burn up 10 minutes easy. Garlic? Makes you stink. Gives you an intimidating psychological advantage. No, I'll pass. I'd like to get laid tonight. I heard that. Let's do this. Let's go! Clear! Hey! Hey, ho! Get away from that damned door! Get away from it! Down on your knees! Come on! Move, man! Hey, watch it! Son of a bitch! Fore! Clear now. With a sheepdog, huh? That's how she made you? Just read me... Come on, man. Come on, man. Easy, man. Come on, man. The locks, man! You ain't no real cops! Shut up! How much you want? We'll cut you devils in for half. Gimme the super glue. Get his hands. Get his hands. Come on! You dumb... All righty. Get up. Go on. This is some felonious bullshit, man! Shut up. Assholes who don't listen don't get to speak. Hey, hey, hey! That's enough. Man: What do you want, man? Money? Ganja? Come on, bitch! Come on, bitch! Take it, take it. Take it! Jesus! Come on. Get in there! Come on! Piss or bleed. Your choice. Oh, boy. That's it, baby. Yeah. Yeah. That's good! Now... Like a good fella, take a drink out of the toilet and lap it up. - Lap it up. - No, man. I ain't getting... Man, come on, drink! Drink! Lap it up, boy! Lap it! Yeah! That's it! Jesus Christ! This is your official eviction notice. As of right now, you are no longer tenants of this building. You hear me? Yeah, man. Yeah, man. Landlord's got another apartment building in south central. I'm done. I'll get rid of Lester. I'll help you with that. Guess all that bad ass noise I heard about you's bullshit. Guess so. Look, you guys are going the other way. I'll call a black and white for a ride. Come on, Vic. Get in, get in. Let him go, man. We don't need him. Word is most of the guys on his team end up dead anyhow. Vic. Vic! Detective! Did Sabrina make the news? Yeah, it was the lead story. Oh, good. Oh, that's good. After the segment ran, another division got an anonymous tip. Said they'd find her body out in a grave near lake Elsinore. Police there just dug up a body. No. No, that's somebody else's little girl. It's not... That's just some kind of a prank, is what that is! Some asshole saw the story and just wanted to hurt me! No. My Sabrina just needs to hear me. Ask her to come home. Your daughter's dead! You made her run away! She got killed! That's Hernan in the blue shirt. I sweet-talked the I.C.E. queen into letting us have some face time with the boy, so long as I promised we'll be subtle. Gonna have to treat him like any other bad guy. Ready? - Yeah. - Here we go. Hey, stop, stop fighting! We know who you are. You're Hernan. Agent Zinman told me where to find you. Who are you? We're on the same side. Get up. Come on. Make it look great for the boys. We heard about some trouble with the salvadorans and the mexicans. Tell me you assholes didn't risk blowing my cover for that. What we got is the salvadorans might have called for a hit on the San Marcos house, then the mexicans retaliated by killing Guardo Lima. It wasn't the salvis. Word is it was some other mexicans. Killed their own? Unlikely. Especially when one of the victims was a government official. Eduardo Romero. You know him? No. It's probably some internal beef. Look, my guess... Guardo's collateral damage. Well, it serves him right. Prick blew up a friend of mine. What, that cop? Guardo didn't do that. I don't care what side this guy's on, he's full of shit. We all knew Emolia was snitching to I.A.D. We knew she was up in the safe house on Harvest. We know she's up in Seattle right now at her sister's. But the word came down, no distractions. These guys don't take out their own rat, no way they'd kill a cop. It was somebody else. Shit, Guardo wasn't even up here then. He was in Mexico with me. Is anyone gonna make this look good? Come on, come on! Get up for me! Guardo didn't kill Lem. Maybe he's wrong... He's not wrong! He's not wrong. Gimme your hand. Get out. Baby, please... Just go. Please, just ask me to come back. No. Baby, please, I'm begging you, please. Just ask me to come back right now. Please. Our son is in the other room. OK. You've got to forgive me. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What I did was wrong. I know it. Please, Mara, please. God. Please, just take me back. You want me to forgive you for sleeping with a girl that is barely out of an inner-city middle school? Forget it. Go ahead. Shoot me. Shoot yourself. I'm not forgiving you. Jackson can never know what I've done. Our son can never know what we've done. Did Vic get you involved in something? He doesn't even know. I killed Lem. I did. I did it. I did it. I dropped the grenade in his lap and I just walked away. And he was... He was still breathing, he was alive, and I just... I just left him there, you know. I just... No. Mara, I-I killed him. Why? For us. Mara, I did it for us. I thought he was gonna take a deal. That he was gonna give us all away. I thought he was gonna take me away from you, from Jackson, from our baby. I didn't know what else to do, Mara. Now it's all wrong. It's all wrong. It just keeps going all wrong. God, please, God, please, please forgive me, please!
