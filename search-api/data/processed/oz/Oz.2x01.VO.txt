SECURITY PENITENTIARY. OZ, WHERE AFTER MONTHS OF TENSION, A RIOT ERUPTED. ( screaming ) ( Augustus ) THE UNIT KNOWN AS "EMERALD CITY" WAS OVERTAKEN BY ITS PRISONERS.

OH, COME ON, SAID. YOU TALK A GOOD GAME ABOUT THE TRUTH. BUT HOW COME IT DOESN'T INCLUDE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE ? I DIDN'T FIRE THOSE RIFLES. DID YOU CREATE A SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CAUSED THE RIFLES TO BE FIRED ? . THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM CREATE D THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, NOT I SE. YOUR COMMISSION IS A FRAUD, CA GOVERNOR DEVLIN, THE ONE MAN WHOSE ACTION S SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED IS THE MAN THAT APPOINTED YOU. THAT'S LIKE ME GETTING TO PICK THE JURY AT MY OWN TRIAL. YOU WANT TO LICK MY BALLS ? ) ( singing ( reporters yelling ) JUDGE FEE AND MR. BALLING WILL FOCUS ON EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE RIOT. R BISHOP CALLAHAN AND MR. DODGE WILL DEAL WITH THE BEHAVIO T. OF THE INMATES AND T HE STAFF DURING THE RIO MRS. EIDUSON AND DUDLEY FRIED WILL CONCENTRATE ON . THEIR DECISION TO SEND THE SORT TEAM ( reporter ) MR. CASE... HOW LONG DO YOU ESTIMATE THE INVESTIGATION WILL TAKE ? DAYS, WEEKS ? WELL,  IT WILL TAKE AS LONG AS IT TAKES. AND YOU'RE ? L. AUGUSTUS HIL HILL... HEY, CAN I A SK YOU A QUESTION ? OT. TWO PRISONERS GOT RELEASED ON THE RI EUGENE DOBBINS , JACKSON VAHUE. ? DOBBINS WAS HURT PRETTY BAD. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM MY QUESTIONS FIRST, HILL. SO TELL ME IN AS MANY WORDS AS NECESSARY WHAT YOU THINK LED TO THE RIOT. THEY'RE VIOLENT, ALL THEY KNOW IS VIOLENCE. THE C.O.s, MAN, THEY TREAT US LIKE SHIT. SOMETIMES THE INMATES GET BORED. . THEY TOOK AWAY CONJUGALS . THEY TOOK AWAY SMOKING NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. YOU  DENY A MAN HIS FREEDOM, HIS FAMILY, HIS PRIVACY, HIS DIGNITY, THEN ALL HE HAS LEFT IS TIME TO SIMMER. THEN EVENTUALLY THE SIMMER BECOMES A BOIL. WE'VE BEEN HEARING WHISPERS THAT THE MUSLIMS WERE GONNA START TROUBLE. THE ARYANS ARE PARANOID. ( Augustus ) WHAT CAUSED THE RIOT ? TWO BRAIN-DEAD CRACK-HEAD MOTHERFUCKERS PLAYING CHECKERS. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE WORLD IMPLODED. FUCKING COCKSUCKER ! WE TREATED THE HOSTAGES GOOD. THEY TREATED US LIKE SHIT. WE TRIED TO NEGOTIATE. THEIR DEMANDS WERE RIDICULOUS. AND THEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT. AHHH ! THERE WAS TEAR GAS. GUNS. TIM McMANUS GOT SHOT IN THE CHEST. I SAW THE SIDE OF RODRIGO'S HEAD GET BLOWN OFF. K. HUNT AND NOWAKOWSKI WERE BOTH HIT IN THE BAC WHAT ABOUT SCOTT ROSS ? WHAT ABOUT HIM ? WELL, ACCORDING TO THE AUTOPSY HE WAS SHOT THREE TIMES. ONCE IN THE HEAD, ONCE IN THE HEART, AND ONCE IN THE TESTICLES. YE AH. I WAS CURIOUS. BULLETS FLYING RANDOMLY EVERY WHICH WAY AND HE GETS SHOT THREE TIMES IN THREE VERY PRECISE PLACES ? . YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT ( Augustus ) THEY SAY CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THE CAT SO CURIOUS ABOUT THAT GOT HIM KILLED ? ( singing ) ( Augustus ) SOLITARY SUCKS, MAN. IF YOU REALLY WANT SOME COMPANY, YOU JUST GOTTA GO THROUGH WITHDRAWAL. JUST WHAT I LOVE, MY PRISON IN LOCKDOWN, CRAWLING WITH OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS AND TV CAMERAS. WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID WE'LL FIND ? IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'LL FIND BUT THE WAY YOU FIND IT. THESE QUESTIONS STIR THINGS UP. AND GOD KNOWS EVERYONE'S STIRRED UP ENOUGH RIGHT NOW. LEO, WHO WAS SCOTT ROSS ? ROSS ? WELL, HE WAS A BIKER, DRUG DEALER, THREE STRIKES LIFER, WHY ? WELL, I'M NOT SURE YET BUT ROSS MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED. WHAT ? DURING THE SORT TEAM'S ATTACK HE MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED DELIBERATELY. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT ? HE WAS SHOT THREE TIME S, ALMOST EXECUTION STYLE. s, AND THE BULLETS IN ROSS' BODY WERE 9mm' S, NOT DOUBLE-OUGHT . WHICH WERE IN SORT RIFLES THE SORT TEAM USES 9mm IN A HANDGUN. RIGHT. SO SORT TEAM MEMBER A, HE ENTERS THE COMMON ROOM IN EM CITY, LOWERS HIS RIFLE, ROSS COMES AT HIM FROM OUT OF THE DARK, HE RAISES HIS HANDGUN, FIRES, THAT'S NOT MURDER. YOU THROW A BULLET IN SOMEONE'S BRAIN, YOU PRETTY MUCH FIGURE HE'S DONE. MAYBE HE SHOT HIM IN THE HEART FIRST, G. OR THE BALLS A ND ROSS  KEPT COMIN YEAH, BUT THE BULLET FROM ROSS' BRAIN WAS IN THE WALL BELOW THE COMMAND CENTER BY A TV. AND THE ONE THAT WENT THROUGH HIS HEART WAS EMBEDDED IN THE FLOOR. SO UNLESS HE DIED FALLING UPWARDS... IT'S MURDER. ( grunting ) ( blowing whistle ) ( Augustus ) IN ALL THAT CHAOS, WHAT A PERFECT CHANCE TO OFF ROSS, AND GET AWAY WITH IT, SCOTT-FREE. THAT'S HIM OVER THERE. OFFICER HEIM ? THE BULLETS THAT KILLED ROSS CAME FROM THE SAME BOX AS THE ONES THAT YOU PUT IN YOUR HANDGUN. SO ? S. SO YOUR GUN WAS USED TO KILL ROS UH-HUH.

AND NOWAKOWSKI NTS NOW HUNT AND NOWAKOWSKI DIED DURING THE FIRST MOME , OF THE ASSAULT AND McMANUS WAS SHOT SO THERE'S LESS OF A CHANCE THAT HE KILLED ROSS. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE IT WAS A C.O. ? WHY NOT A PRISONER ? ROSS WASN'T EXACTLY BELOVED BY HIS FELLOW INMATES. HT. OH, THAT WAS MY FIRST THOUG Y THAT SOMEONE USE D THE OPPORTUNIT TO TAKE REVENGE ON A GUY.

HOW COULD YOU CRADLE HIM WITH YOUR ARMS BEHIND YOUR BACK ? HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN A RIOT ? NO. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S INVOLVED. THE IDEA OF BEING A HOSTAGE, THE MOB MENTALITY, YOU GET CARRIED AWAY, YOU STOP BEING HUMAN. YOU BECOME PART OF SOMETHING ELSE. I HAVE MADE EVERY MISTAKE THERE IS. I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE WRONG MEN, I HAD A BABY OUT OF WEDLOCK, I DRANK TOO MUCH, I SNORTED TOO MUCH. I HAVE DONE THINGS TO MAKE MONEY, INCLUDING THIS JOB, WHICH MAKE ME DREAD GETTING OUT OF BED. BUT EACH TIME I MADE THE CHOICE. I CHOSE TO DRINK, I CHOSE TO STOP. WHEN MY HUSBAND GOT ABUSIVE, I CHOSE TO WALK. I REFUSE TO BE ANYBODY'S VICTIM. THESE MISTAKES I'VE MADE, THEY ARE A PART OF ME. THEY ARE LIKE MY SKIN. AND I DO NOT REGRET WHAT I'VE DONE. DO YOU HEAR ME ? NO REGRETS, NO REMORSE. I JUST KEEP GOING. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ? WHEN I KNOW, YOU'LL KNOW. SHE HAS A YOUN G DAUGHTER, A MOTHER IN AND OUT OF CHEMO. SO WHAT, LEO, SO WHAT ? TH, SO IF YOU EXPOSE THE TRU YOU DESTROY THIS WOMAN'S LIFE AND HER DAUGHTER'S. AND FOR WHAT, SCOT T FUCKING ROSS ?! E. COME ON ALVAH, PLEAS WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY, LEO ? TO SAY THAT ROSS DIED LIKE THE OTHERS, M FROM BULLETS FIRED BY A MEMBER OF THE SORT TEA IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTY. I JUST READ THE PRELIMINARY DRAFT OF YOUR REPORT. WHAT'S WRONG ? YOU RECOMMEND NOT FILING CHARGES AGAINST SAID AND THE RIOT LEADERS ?! FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT, THE EVIDENCE IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL. FROM A MORAL STANDPOINT, IT'S LAUGHABLE. LOOK, GOVERNOR , AS FAR AS I CAN SEE, WHATEVER THEY DID CAME ABOUT AS A DIRECT RESULT OF YOUR ACTIONS ! . YOU'VE EXONERATED ME. OH, YEAH, YEAH YOUR COMMISSION BEHAVE D LIKE GOOD LITTLE BOYS. S. BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAY IF THE PRISONERS ARE GUILTY, SO ARE YOU. THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF ATTITUDE I EXPECT FROM AN ATTORNEY GENERAL. YEAH, WELL, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL. I WANT TO BE GOVERNOR. WHAT ? I'LL SEE YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, DEVLIN. NOW, I'VE GOT A PRESS CONFERENCE TO DO. IT IS THE CONSIDERED OPINION OF THIS COMMISSION THAT THOUGH THE RIOT ITSELF AND THE DEATHS THAT FOLLOWED ARE TRAGIC, NO ONE IN PARTICULAR IS AT FAULT. ( reporter chatter ) WE DO FEEL THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN MEASURES THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO INSURE THAT AN EVENT LIKE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. BITCH. ( Augustus ) SO, AS IT TURNS OUT, NO ONE WAS TO BLAME FOR THE RIOT. IN FACT, IF NO ONE WAS TO BLAME, THAT MEANS NOTHING BAD HAPPENED. NOTHING AT
