THE AZTECS, WHO BELIEVED THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS CREATED BY VIOLENCE. EVERY YEAR WHAT WAS THEIR VERSION OF CHRISTMAS, THEY WOULD CUT OUT SOMEONE'S HEART AND OFFER IT UP TO THE GODS. THESE PEOPLE WERE CONVINCE THAT WITHOUT THIS SACRIFICE, THE SUN WOULD FALL FROM THE SKY AND THE WORLD WOULD COME TO AN END. THEN THE SPANIARDS LANDED, WIPED THE AZTECS OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. TURNS OUT THEY WAS RIGHT. THE WORLD DID COME TO AN END, FOR THEM. WELCOME TO OZ. 10 MONTHS AFTER THE WORLD ENDED. (McManus ) ALRIGHT.

EACH GROUP WILL HAVE ONE MEMBER SERVE ON SAID COUNCIL. ANY QUESTIONS ? YES, GIVEN ALL THAT'S HAPPENED, WHY DID YOU COME BACK ? WHY DO YOU STILL BELIEVE EMERALD CITY WILL WORK ? WELL, THE TRUTH IS THIS. WE EITHER LEARN TO CHANGE OR WE REPEAT OUR MISTAKES. WE EITHER BECOME A PART OF OUR COMMUNITY, OR WE REMAIN ISOLATED FROM IT.
