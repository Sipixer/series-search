Is there any way that Intersect images can be taken out? Can it be removed? Only Orion would know. - Orion. - <i>Hello, Chuck.</i> It's good to finally see you face-to-face.</i> Those cards you're looking at</i> are the schematics for the new Intersect.</i> Study them. If you can find FULCRUM's Intersect,</i> you could get your old life back.</i> I promised Ellie that I'd find dad to walk her down the aisle but I've tried everything. He's nowhere;</i> it's like he's fallen of the face of the Earth.</i> Dad. I'm sort of freaking out here. I know. But he's your father, and he seemed happy to see you. You think? I thought it was just lack of recognition followed by shock. - You take cream? - Huh? Yeah. No. Whatever's fine. I can't even remember if I take cream. - Just relax. - How? I-I haven't... I haven't seen my dad for, like, ten years, and now I'm sitting in his living room/kitchenette while he's making us coffee. Plus, let's just say the last time I saw him, he was kind of-- I mean, he tended to be a little... What's the word? Crazy. Here we go. Thanks. So good to see that face again. Yeah, yours, too. So, uh, you doing okay? Who cares about me? Tell me about you. Uh, well, you know, there's not, there's not much to tell. Graduated from high school. Went to Stanford. Work at Buy More. Stanford. Not bad. He always was a genius-- this one. No, not like you. You're right. He was smarter. What about Ellie? How is she? Really great, actually. Umm... She's a doctor now. And-and in a few weeks, she's gonna get married to, well, an-an awesome guy.</i> Ellie's getting married? She is. That, uh, that's actually mainly why we're here. Ellie was really hoping that you might be there to walk her down the aisle. I don't think she would want me there. I-I mean, of course, of course she does. We both do. It's not a good idea. But tell her that I'm happy for her.</i> Are you, are you joking? You have to do this. She's your daughter. Don't you want to be there?</i> Charles, I can't... I-I don't want to hear what you can't do. I've seen what you can't do. I'm sorry. I, uh... That came out wrong. No, it didn't. You're mad. I left, and-and you're mad. Look, Dad, I'm not even here for me really, okay? Right now, I just... I want you to come home for Ellie, please. I like you coming up here and fighting for Ellie. Makes me happy you... at least had each other. Let me get a few things together. Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. I mean, I'm glad we found him for Ellie. And for you? Yeah. Maybe he's not as crazy as I remembered. Okay. Let's go get your sister married, huh? Maybe we should wait till dark. They're... They're tracking my every move. Rat bastards. S02E19: Chuck Versus The Dream Job Transcript: YDY.com/BBS Sync: YTET-ÅÝÅÝ·É [YDY.com] Final Edit By: VeRdiKT [Subscene.com] So, I was thinking that this would be perfect for the rehearsal dinner 'cause if I wear that sage dress, this will match perfectly.</i> - Sounds good. - Or... Ellie, hey. Hey, Chuck. Just a sec. We could do the cranberry, which would really bring out your, um, your... Hello, Eleanor. Aren't you gonna say something? Pancakes. Oh, boy. You said you were gonna make pancakes. Well, that-that went well. Hey. You must be Devon. Yeah. Big TV. Ellie, I'm sorry. I should have called first. A surprise of this magnitude wasn't the best idea. No, it's not your fault. I'm just... so mad at him, our crazy old dad. Aren't you mad at him? I was, yeah. But then, I realized that... You know, we can hate him for the rest of our lives, or we can choose to forgive him. It's easier to hate him. Well, that may be. But he's all we got left, El. This could be our last chance at being a family again. Let's go. I guess I was just, uh, surprised to see you, Dad. Yeah. I'm sure you were. God, Ellie, y-you look just like your mother. Sorry I left you two alone like that. No, no, it's fine. Your dad was just explaining our television to me. I was just telling, uh, Devon that I, um, I practically invented your TV. I came up with these helix-shaped plasma crystals back in high school. Um, never saw a dime for it. Okay, well, who's hungry? I'll order pizza. Touch-screen technology. That was one of mine. Uh, Ted Roark and I came up with it back in grad school. Dad, you went to school with Ted Roark? The Roark Instruments guy? Awesome. Yeah, he took all my ideas, and, uh, I-I never got anything.</i> Guy's a... lying thief. Well, how about I, uh, order the pizza. Pepperoni? Roark's releasing a new software this week that I guarantee has components that I helped develop.</i> Yeah, pepperoni sounds great, hon. I still have my original touch-screen schematics. And I... I want to show you. Uh, D... Okay, guys, I'm really trying here, but</i> he is obviously as crazy as we remember. It seems Chuck's flash matches a lot of chatter</i> we've been hearing about Roark Instruments lately.</i> The CIA now believes Ted Roark's latest software</i> may contain a virus that, if released,</i> could cause irreparable damage to the world's computer networks.</i> Why don't we just contact Roark and tell them our concerns? We can't out of fear of alerting those who might be involved.</i> Instead, we're going to send in Chuck</i> as a new RI employee. You will see if you flash on anyone or anything.</i> Your interview is in one hour.</i> Are you okay with that? Why wouldn't he be? Well, his dad went to school with Roark. There could be some history there. Your daddy issues gonna jeopardize our mission? No, no, I'm fine. I mean, forget Apple. Forget Microsoft. I've dreamt of working for Roark since college. Although, does it actually qualify as a dream come true if I go in as a janitor? You're going in as Charles Bartowski. Your name, your resume, your Stanford degree. Really? You're perfectly qualified to go in as yourself. Me at RI? Oh, hey. You must be Chuck. I'm Drew. Welcome to Roark Instruments, where the future happens first.</i> I love it here. Huh. Everyone does. Please, have a seat. Oh, ri--uh, here, yeah. Sorry. I'm not nor... So, I see you went to Stanford. Me, too. Class of '07. '07, wow. You-you've only been out a couple of years? That's eons in the software game. Come on. Where you been? Seriously, tell me what you're up to since you graduated. Uh, well, uh... What have I been up to? Uh...</i> Chuck, just be honest. Um, I've actually been working at a Buy More, um... in the Nerd Herd division, which, you know, has given me quite a bit of experience working with, you know, different computers, operating systems, technologies.</i> You know, I've gotten the opportunity to work</i> with many different... unusual personalities. - Good morning, Big Michael! - Woah! Where the hell did you come from? We have a proposition for you. I'll pass. Excuse me. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Two words: NextExpo. - That's one word. - Stop counting. Tomorrow is Roark's Next Technology Expo where they're gonna be releasing</i> their new operating system to the entire world.</i> Now, we believe... that attending that release will make us better employees. And better human beings. - NextExpo, huh? - Yeah. Good thinking. Send Bartowski. - Chuck's not here. - As usual. Okay, fine. You both can go. Have fun camping out at the weirdo convention. I would say probably my greatest weakness is</i> how little I pushed myself since college. I've been trapped in a job, a life that I don't really want, but...</i> Don't really see a way out. Being here's a good start. Well, clearly, you're qualified. And it doesn't hurt that you're a fellow Stanford alum. I'd love for you to take the job. Really? Thank you so much! Congratulations, Chuck. Wow, thanks! W-Wait. Here we go. - There we go. - There we go. - Okay. - Bye. We'll work on those ball skills. Hey, what's that? The lobby. - What's that? - Elevator. - What's that? - The bathroom. Man, this place is awesome! Over there's R&D, and that hallway leads to our testing facilities. Sorry about the shortened tour. We've been so busy with this software release. All right. Right around here is... Hey, Ted, this is Chuck, our new employee. Hey, welcome to RI. Never wash that hand. I never will, sir. No "sirs" around here. Except for her. Well... Okay, Ted. It's just a... It's just an honor to be here and working for your company. Well, easy, big boy. You already got the gig. Ready to take over the world? Only 24 hours of camping and NextExpo is ours. Because... - Hey. - I don't know what to say.</i> I'm a little speechless. Welcome to the team. Happy to have you aboard. Oh, yeah. Uh... Wow. Think Morgan knows that Chuck's cheating on the Buy More? You know your boyfriend just took a job at Roark?</i> Of course, I was the first one he told. You guys are over. Yeah, okay. It's weird. Even though I know it's not real,</i> I am excited about this job. Chuck, you got to remember it's just an assignment. No, I-I mean, I know... I know what it is. I just... If I had gotten this job at Roark right after college, maybe I'd never become the Intersect. Then when my dad comes back after ten years, I can show him that I'm not just another loser working at a Buy More. Chuck, he knows you're not a loser. Well, I'm sure he hoped I'd be doing something a little bigger than Nerd Herding. You are. Cheers! Charles! Perfect timing, you two. - Oh, wow, I'm so starving... - <i>Hey.</i> been sitting and waiting! I'm sorry. Where you been? Ah, well, you know, working</i> saving the lives of small technological devices. How about a toast? To family. Uh, Dad, we are extremely grateful to have you home. Yes, we are. Welcome. Thank you. And-and, here's to you and Devon. May you live happily together forever. You deserve it. - Thank you. - Oh, thanks. When's the bachelor party? I, um, I already had it. And? How was it? Oh, I don't really want to talk about it. Well, okay, I got one. How about um, to Chuck's new job? - What? - <i>That's what I hear.</i> You know, Lester tells me that</i> you're leaving your old buddy and the Buy More behind to go all corporate over at Roark Instruments, which, I get it, pretty cool. So...</i> Good luck, buddy. Chuck, that's amazing. You going to work for Roark? The man who stole everything from me? Either this is a mission or you two are very good at hiding your hobbies. We're going in to retrieve the source code for the new operating system. Without it, Roark can't release the software or the virus. It's gonna take time to break in the secured vault. Look, we need you to keep an eye on Roark in case anything goes wrong. Keep an eye on Roark? - What-- - Have a nice first day. Everyone, welcome to NextExpo 2009.</i> Please. One at a time.</i> Miss, stay in line. Miss, hey-- Chuck! Hey, Chuck! Chuck, over here. Chuck! Charles! He's already forgotten us. It's like he looked right through me. Hey, not to add any extra pressure to you guys, but there's a FULCRUM agent here.</i> He's some kind of computer terrorist.</i> Well, if FULCRUM is here, it's even more vital that we stop this launch. Arigato. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. Then you better hurry up. Roark's about to take the stage.</i> Access denied. Have an amazing day.</i> Damn it. I'm gonna need to do a patch. Dad, you're really not gonna watch that, are you? I have to watch Chuck's first day</i> even if he is working for Roark.</i> Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the architect of the digital age</i> and Time magazine's Man of the Year: Ted Roark.</i> Thank you. Welcome to NextExpo 2009!</i> Or as I like to call it, "Ted Greets the Little People." Just kidding. You believe this guy? We've done some amazing things this year.</i> At least I have. I mean, I...</i> traveled around the world in a hot air balloon...</i> uh, bought another island. It's private. Don't visit.</i> What else? Let's see. Oh! And we invented a new operating system that's going to change the world! Let's not waste any more time.</i> Do you have any idea how much money I'm losing</i> just standing here? By pressing this button, RIOS will be released. The whole world will have access, free access to our latest software. It's happening. We're encountering security we've never seen before. Access denied again. That's twice.</i> Maybe I should call security.</i> Uh-oh. Please tell me that was a good "Uh-oh." You know, I love a countdown!</i> I'd like you to join me. Ready? Ten... There's a countdown happening. Okay, Chuck, listen, we cannot access the source code. You're gonna have to just, just stop the release.</i> But I could get fired! It's not your real job. Hurry. Six, five, four, three, two... - No, wait! - One! What the hell are you doing? Is that Chuck? Wow, he's on stage. He must have gotten promoted. No, no water pass right now, okay? Get off the stage. I, uh, I... I, uh, I can't. I can't. I'm so-- - Get off the stage! - Go! Come on!</i> Don't deny us our new software, nerd!</i> You can't press that button. The CIA believes that your software has been infected with a virus, that when released, will cause worldwide computer damage. Do you have any idea how crazy you sound? Yeah, I do. I do. But please, you have to believe me. No, I really... I really don't. I'm sorry for the little technical delay. It must be my rock star magnetism. It drives some people batty.</i> - Go, Charles! - No, Chuck! - Go! - Stop! That's great! That's my boy! Oh, no! And you call yourself a Stanford man. Let's get back to it. Three, two, one... Have you heard from my brother? Was I supposed to hear from your brother? Chuck is not picking up. Do you think he's in jail? Do you get a phone call when you're in jail? In the movies, you get a phone call. I don't know. I'm going to call 411. Who do I ask for, the county jail? Ellie, I just worked an 18-hour shift. Now just slow down, honey. Tell me what happened. Chuck freaked out. He hopped on stage at some computer convention and tried to attack his new boss. What? Why would he do that? I have no idea. Although, we should probably ask my dad. Since obviously, you put him up to it. What? I didn't tell him to do anything. Come on, Dad. Why else would he throw away a job of a lifetime? Ted Roark isn't worthy of your brother or his talents. It was a lousy job. And what do you call working at the Buy More, Dad? Don't you get it? Chuck has been waiting for ten years to impress you, and now this opportunity comes along where he can follow through on some crazy made-up vendetta of yours. Trust me, sweetie. Your brother knows what he's doing. You want me to trust you? Ellie, maybe your dad's right. Maybe-maybe Chuck has got a good explanation. Sure, Devon, I'm sure he does. He probably just forgot the whole thing happened, right? Just like at your bachelor party. I'm sorry. I don't want to drag us into this. I'm just really worked up right now. So.. I'm going to... take a walk. - Ellie... - Let her walk, Devon. Drink? No, no way. That's what got me in trouble in the first place.</i> What do I do? You're asking the wrong guy. She's your daughter. Well, I can't take credit for her. The only thing Ellie owes me is a few well-deserved trust issues. You really want my advice? Don't walk out on your kids when you promised them pancakes for dinner. They... tend to take it badly. You're a... real straight arrow, aren't you? I used to be; before this damn bachelor party. God, I'm such a jackass. Maybe. But that's not why Ellie's mad. She just doesn't want you to turn into me, which... take this as a compliment-- seems pretty damn unlikely. So come on, have a drink. To straight arrows. Okay, all right. Show me what you want me to do. Why did you send me these cards, Orion?</i> Do you want me to build an Intersect?</i> Or find an Intersect?</i> How can I use these cards to find an Intersect?</i> Hey, I'm a little... I'm a little busy right now. Just give me one minute. And then you can go back to whatever you were doing.</i> Ellie thinks you did what you did at Roark for me, and if that's true, I'll never forgive myself... - Dad-- - Still my minute? I ruined every good thing that ever happened to me. My family, my job, my entire life, thrown away. I won't stand by and let the same thing happen to you. That's one torch I'd rather not pass. If working for Roark is-is that important to you, then I-I think you should fight for it.</i> And don't let my past destroy your future. I miss getting advice from you. Well, my minute's up. You were in the middle of something. Oh, my God! Roark has an Intersect. What? An Intersect. Roark has one. You thinks Roark is hiding a supercomputer, the size of a football field, inside his office. Yes! Well, maybe. What exactly did you flash on? I... I... I didn't. I didn't. I didn't flash on anything technically. I was just thinking. But it makes sense. We know that FULCRUM is working on trying to implant intel into their agents, but they still need a supercomputer-- an Intersect, to crunch all that data. Only someone like Roark could do that. Ted Roark is working for FULCRUM? I know it sounds crazy, but what if RIOS is actually a Trojan horse? Like a virus designed to steal intel from the government, corporations, anybody, everybody. And you just thought this up, out of the blue? No flash, no proof? Beckman will laugh in our faces. Guess the apple doesn't fall too far from the crazy tree, does it? I'm sorry, Chuck. Sarah... Sarah... Think about what it could mean if Roark has an Intersect. I could finally get this thing out of my head. I need your help to break into Roark's office. Beckman's orders are clear. So are the consequences of not following them. I'm sorry. Cute outfit, Bartowski. - Give me that back. - First, you tell me what it is. Interesting question. Those are designs for the Intersect. You stole Roark's designs. Orion's. He sent them to me before he died. There's a map hidden in the plans that matches to layout of Roark Instruments. Orion contacted you and you didn't tell us? I think he wanted me to break in. Yeah, and I want you to take off my gear before I break your geek neck. - Oh. - I know what I'm doing. You have no idea. You're entering a world of pain, Chuck. I want this Intersect out of my head. Are you going to help me or not? You got to be... Is that a tranq gun? You don't even have the common courtesy to threaten me with an actual firearm. What's your answer, Casey? Put the toy down and get your ass back... I'm going to kill you when I wake up. Sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, come on. That's the oldest excuse in the book.</i> Yes, he knows me. I want to see Ted Roark. - Just calm down. - Look. He might have screwed me,</i> but I'm not going to let that son of a bitch screw my son. Get your own hands off of me! Listen, you tell your boss I'm not leaving this building</i> until my boy gets his job back! What are you doing, Dad? What do you want me to do with him? Bring him in. We'll deal with it in private.</i> Excuse me. Are you in charge of these meatheads? Dad, Dad, Dad, we have to go. We have to go right now. I can explain all of this to you later. For now, all I can tell you is... I'm not who you think I am. It's good to see you again. Good to see both of you. Don't worry, Charles. I'm not who you think I am either. Hands up. Are you coming? We should go, Charles.</i> Oh, my God. You're Orion. We should hurry. Casey, where's Chuck? In a world of pain. I can't believe this. My father invented the Intersect. That's not true. I didn't invent all of it. Just... The really cool stuff. Come on. Granted, I can understand how this might complicate a few things. This way. What? Complicate a few things? Dad, I saw you die! I saw you explode in the helicopter. But I see how I could've given you that impression. I've had to die quite a few times. One of the perils of being Orion. This isn't what I wanted, Chuck. But when I realized what the government was going to do with the Intersect,</i> I had to run. And your guys wouldn't be the only ones who are looking for me, and more importantly... I knew I had to stay away from you and your sister. Come on. Wait, Dad. You were protecting us? I knew I'd have to spend the rest of my life hiding from the Intersect, but... I never imagined that it would find you. It must be such a curse to have all those secrets trapped in your head. That's why I came back. That's why I let your handlers find me. It's my fault... that FULCRUM's after both of us now. You wanted me to flash on your crazy schematics. You wanted me to break in here. Why didn't you just say who you were? Would you have trusted me? After not seeing me for ten years, I just appear, bring you to RI and tell you that I can get the Intersect, which I also built, out of your head? What would you have said to that? That you were a little bit crazy. Exactly. Now, punch in the code or we'll be a little bit dead. Listen, no, Dad, you don't understand. It doesn't work like that. Unless it's in here, I can't do it. Yes, you can. I designed that computer in your head, son. Flash. And it'll be the last thing you ever have to flash on. Aces, Charles. That's the Intersect? 2.0. My baby. My greatest creation. After you and your sister, of course. Let's make that the hot seat. We need to make some minor modifications to Roark's software. So, uh, what exactly does your new program do? Well, usually the Intersect works in the other way around, but I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be able to take out information. In theory. At least. What you're going to see are a bunch of encoded images that will cancel out the ones that you originally uploaded.</i> Wait. Are you saying you're gonna overwrite my brain? That's a good way of putting it, yes. - Ready? - No. Your glasses. Oh. Yeah, right. Good luck, Charles. Something's wrong. No, no... No. It's not working! No, it doesn't work. But I'm sure you'll have it up and running in no time. You always did have a way with machines, Orion. And remember? I always had... Well, I always had a way with the girls. Remember? Hey, come on, man. What's the matter?</i> No hug for your old partner? No? I've been looking for you for a long time. The years have been unkind.</i> I could offer you a good moisturizer. Huh? No? Okay. Put him on the helicopter. Kill the CIA agent. He's my son. He's your son? Congratulations! That's great! I had no idea. Kill the son. Wait, I-I'll... I'll build anything you want. Give FULCRUM their Intersect. But my son walks away from here. You'll build it either way. You're gonna torture me? After ten years away from my family? My son walks away! All right, all right. I'm not a monster. I mean, I'm... Little bit of a monster. But today is his lucky day. Shotgun on the chopper! Let's go. Charles. Take care of your sister. - No-- - Take care of yourself. - Dad? - You can do this without me. I'm not gonna leave you. Remember when I told you not to trust your handlers? Maybe I was wrong. If your son's gonna walk, he should do it now. Good-bye, Chuck. No! In our raid of Roark Instruments,</i> we failed to retrieve either the Intersect or Stephen Bartowski.</i> Clearly, we recognize that FULCRUM's possession of Orion</i> poses an unparalleled security threat.</i> You mean FULCRUM's possession of my father. I promise you. No one at the CIA knew your father's secret identity.</i> I also promise to entrust his recovery to our best team.</i> General, we are your best team! Can't believe I'm gonna say this. Chuck's right. No, you cannot put Chuck back in the field. It is too dangerous. FULCRUM knows that he is Orion's son. Look, as soon as my dad finishes the new Intersect for Roark, I'm worthless to you. Obsolete. And FULCRUM wins.</i> The only thing that matters now</i> is getting my father back. And you need me to do that. Very well, Mr. Bartowski.</i> The assignment is yours. Provided your personal entanglements,</i> do not interfere with the mission.</i> Dad? Ellie, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your dad may have split. His stuff's all gone. Hey, hey, I'm sure he's planning on coming back for the wedding. No, no, he's not. Well, if it's any consolation, I'm not going anywhere. Ever. I mean, no matter how hard things get between us. Because that's what married people do, right? Just think. In 50 years, we'll walk back on my bachelor party and laugh about it. No. No, we won't. Or maybe not. Chuck? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Only my career was injured. Chuck, um... Dad's gone. I yelled at him about what happened at your work today. I think I said some things that-- Ellie, it's not your fault. Well, no. It's my fault that I asked you to find him. I thought I needed him to walk me down the aisle. I thought that he would be different from that guy that walked out on us. I guess I just expected too much from him. Don't count him out yet.
