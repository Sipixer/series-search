(muffled breathing) Woman: Well, let's have a look at you.</i> Where am I? Who are you? My name is sydney. And... (grunts) (horns honking) Here's where you are. Now... I trust we're feeling all right? Not too many bumps and bruises? After all, we're going to need you In tip-top shape. Need me for what? Nothing too difficult. At least not for one of the cia's best. No, no, no, you got me mixed up with someone else. I'm just a doctor. We know exactly who you are, devon. (sighs) So, please, Tell me... ...What's it like being a world-class spy? (car horn honking) Chuck, stop freaking out. Oh, I'm not freaking out. I'll tell you why I'm not freaking out. That would require me overreacting, And I don't think it's technically possible For me to overreact to my brothe r-in-law being kidnapped! We're doing the best we can, chuck. Why don't you go upstairs, go to work. We'll call you as soon as we have any news. Chuck: Look at that-- ellie is making Her 50th call to awesome within the hour, In addition to the 20 that she's Made to me already today. She's-she's losing it. What-what am I supposed to tell her? Honestly, chuck, I think the best thing you can do Is to just calm down. Here's a little tip: If you really Want someone to calm down, Never tell them to calm down, Because it doesn't work! They don't calm down! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm calming down. Here comes the calm. I will soon... Be calm. Not working. I'm not calming down. I tell you what-- I got an idea. I'm going to go to work, And then you guys call me The absolute second that you hear Anything about devon. (sighs) Big mike: Calm down, morgan. You got nothing to worry about, son. So, you can wipe that concerned look off that... Hairy face. Yeah, well, it's just... It's a little unusual That you would call me in Before I even have time to screw anything up. You're right. Usually, mornings are big mike time. Time for reflection and-and pastry. But I'll tell you something, son. You've become like family to me. Oh. Thank you, sir. No. Thank your mama. Woman makes me feel good. Real good. Like a man should. But credit where it's due. I've noticed a change in you lately. You're commanding more respect from your coworkers. You're walking a little taller around here. Seems to me... You're ready to run with the big dogs. Of course. Wait, what? Morgan, are you ready to be my assistant manager? Me, sir? I believe in you, son. Well? Yes. Yeah, this will be good. One of the big dogs. (barks) No. Don't do that. That's a little dog- schnauzer or something. (deep bark) big dog. Chuck: Hey, sarah-- chuck. I had an idea-- delta force. Have you called them yet? If not, call me back with their number, okay? Lester: Ah. Just in time. Need that big brain of yours, charles. Jeff is dead wrong about something. Well, that's kind of his default setting, is it not? Woman: Excuse me, sir. Can you help me? I understand you're having a big sale on hdtvs. Uh, yes, we are. Lester or jeff here could actually... Sarah. (sighs) Seriously, charles, It's an emergency here. Woman: Young man, you even listening? (speaking thai) (speaking thai) (whimpers) (sighs) Excuse me. I'm so sorry. I went... That's not what I meant to say. (sighs) Impressive. Now, if jean-claude van damme And steven seagal got into a fight, Who do you think would win? This is your big question? Bear in mind that master seagal's Fighting style choice is aikido-- like so... "I'm just a cook. I'm a lowly cook." Come on, buddy! Lester: Come on, buddy. Come on. I'm not going to hurt you. What you got? What you got? Boom, boom, pow! Okay. I think he'll live, But we need to get you out of here. Listen, we think we know who has awesome. The last patient that he saw at the hospital Was a ring operative. What? What, sarah? The ring? Oh, my god. This is all my fault. I'm the one who got him involved in all this. They're probably torturing him as we speak. No, there is no reason to think that. Yeah, you're right. There are hundreds of other nightmare scenarios Far worse. Uh, chuck... No, don't you understand? I'm responsible for this. I killed captain awesome. Oh, my god. You're back. Thank god. Oh, my god, you're back. You're back. This is... This is great news. This is very good news. Are you okay? Tell me you're okay. Chuck, they think I'm a spy. I'm in trouble here, man. They think I'm you. Sync by honeybunny (tires screeching) Â¶ na-na na-na na-na Â¶ Â¶ na-na na-na na-na Â¶ Â¶ na-na na-na na-na Â¶ Â¶ na-na na-na na-na Â¶ Â¶ na-na na-na na-na Â¶ Â¶ na-na na-na na-na Â¶ (whimpers) From what he has told us, we can conclude that the woman Devon was with is sydney prince, The head of a ring cell in los angeles. She has tried to recruit several of our agents. She knows everything about me, chuck. Ellie, too. Everything except who the real spy in the family is. That's an understandable mistake. One of them looks like a spy, And the other one looks... Like chuck. True. She gave me this. She told me she'd contact me with instructions. It's a ring communication device, general. Exactly. It works off a closed network, But the nsa has recently developed New technology to crack it. Now we can put it into use. All right. Fantastic news. Sounds like a plan. I'm going to get awesome back To my sister before she has an aneurysm. You can't take him home quite yet, chuck. We still need to talk about how we're going to use devon. Excuse me-- what? Oh, no, no. No one's using devon. There will be no using of him anymore. Okay, no more fun spy games for him, forever. Using devon is our best option. Sydney won't go to her superiors with his identity Until she definitively knows Whether she has turned him or burned him. When sydney contacts him, He'll do what she says just long enough for us To track her, find her and bring her in. You mean I have to do what she says? No, you don't. No, he doesn't. This is my family we're talking about here. Come on. It's the only way to keep him safe. Devon, we'll be with you every step of the way. If you tell me you can get me through this, I trust you. I will, devon. I promise. Morgan: Um, excuse me. Stop right there. Are you leaving early again, bartowski? Are you serious? No, of course not, man. I'm kidding. No, I mean, are you being serious? Are you seriously wearing that vest right now? Ah. Big mike made me... Assistant manager. And I accepted it. Boom. Well, congratulations, buddy. I'm proud of you. Lester: Charles. Oh! Oh, wow. Lester, I'm really sorry About the... That was a completely kne e-jerk reaction. You know what? I'm just going to switch to decaf from now on. It's not a problem. In fact, I want to thank you. You helped me feel something I have not felt in a long time. Another human's foot on your body? The thrill of being alive. What? The electrifying sensation Of pain coursing through my face Was like an adrenaline shot to my soul. It made me feel like a man, Maybe for the first time since my bar mitzvah. I've never had a bar mitzvah. Chuck, please. I want you to hit me as hard as you can. Chuck: I... I think That you two are certifiably disturbed. I'm going to go home. So... Hey. Uh, you want a ride home? Yeah, I got access to the company car. Oh, big man on campus. All right. Well, actually, uh, awesome's at the mall today, And we got to talk about a few things, So I'll see you at home. Oh. All right. Chuck: You okay, man? Captain: No, no, it's ellie. God, chuck. What am I going to tell her about where I've been? I'm a terrible liar, man. (door opening) Devon, is that you? (whispering): Remember to keep it simple. Simple. Oh, thank god. I was so worried. Yeah, babe, I'm... I'm fine. Why didn't you call? Um, uh... After I got off the overnight, I decided I needed to clear my head. So, I went for a run... In griffith park. No cell phones there. Uh-uh. So, I'm running, And I just... I heard something In a tree. It was a... It's a cat. A hurt cat. I had to see if it needed medical attention. Then, I realized... It's a bear. What's a bear? The cat's a bear? Yeah, yeah, the cat's a bear. It's a... It's a bear, and it... Jumps out at me, And it attacks, and it's like... It's angry at me For some reason, this bear. (roars) Oh, my god! You were attacked by a bear? Yeah, and I... I... Cut off its head. Yeah, babe, I... I decapitated the bear. In self-defense, in order to survive. I'm just glad you weren't there to see it. It was really grisly. Do you honestly expect me to believe this? Because you two think I'm an idiot. Is that what you think? No, no, no. That is not what we think. That is not what we think. I think that it's time that we tell ellie the truth. Oh, yeah. Thank god, chuck. The truth. I'm terrible at this. I'm a terrible liar, honey. You know that. Clearly. Casey was arrested Early this morning in griffith park. He was drunk, super drunk. Really blotto. Cop's words, not mine. He was in bad shape, wasn't he, devon? Yeah. Yeah, it was bad, hon. He wet himself. Also exposed himself. Anyhow, devon... Spent most of the day, Pretty much all day down at the station Talking to a buddy of his on the force Trying to get the charges dropped, so... Oh, my god. Really? Really. Really. (door closes) Hey, guys. Ugh. Uh, let's go inside, devon. (door opens then closes) What? Nothing. (grunts) (clears throat) Jeff? You got a second? What's going on here, man? I noticed everybody's a little beat up. The first rule of fight... Easy. Our friend, morgan, here is The assistant manager now. Oh, guys. We've worked together for a long time. You know, we're... We're chums. Whatever you say. Ass man. Don't you mean, mr. Ass man? I do not. Chuck: I can't believe the ring thinks awesome's a spy.</i> This is crazy. This-this is crazy. When do you think she's gonna call? What do you think she's gonna say? What do you think we do when she does call? Chuck, the important thing is That devon will be looking to you as his handler. And you need to remember what it felt like To be scared and new to this. Yeah, like he'll ever forget that. Think of it this way: On this mission, Devon is you and you're her. So, be her, chuck, huh? Well, maybe sydney will never call? (knocking on door) captain: Guys. Guys, it's me. You in there? She called. What's that? Found it on my front step. It's from sydney. I gotta open it right away. She's gonna call in about five minutes. Come on. What do you think is in there? (beeping) It's okay, answer it. Hello? From now on, devon, I will speak to you through the earpiece Included in the package. And you will speak to me through the watch we sent. Now, put in the earpiece, and put on the watch. (whispering): Par for the course. Just do what she says. Okay, putting on the earpiece now. (beeps) Now we can track you on our own gps network. It's fine. Standard operating procedure. Be at the crystal towers downtown in one hour. Come alone. Oh, and, devon, the earpiece is also an explosive device. Remove it, or deviate from my instructions in any way, And I will detonate it, Ruining that lovely face of yours. Sarah: No. Okay, well, that is not standard... At all. Captain: Chuck? Chuck, it's me. Can you hear me? Yes, yes, buddy, yes. I'm-I'm right here. And you're sure they can't hear me talking to you? They can only hear you if you press the button on their watch. An open bug would be far too easy to trace. I've labeled the watches so you don't get confused. Sarah: Devon, this is sarah. As soon as sydney calls, Casey's going to start tracking the signal. As soon as we've tracked her location, We're going to bring her in and then you're done. Whew. Okay, good. Chuck, this gonna work, right, buddy? Remember, If you freak out, he's going to freak out. This is absolutely going to work. Everything is fine. I am very confident. (beeping) sydney: Devon? Are you ready to begin? Ready. There is a penthouse on the 12th floor. Go there. The building has extensive security, But it's nothing that you can't handle. We'll talk again once you're there. She's close. Wasn't on the line long enough to get an exact location. Need another call. Another call?! No, we can't wait. The guy's got an explosive earpiece stuck in his head! Chuck, our target is sydney. We need to get her to save him. Okay, fine, then you get her, And I'll get awesome up to the 12th floor. Buddy, head inside the building and wait. Wait? Wait for what? (grunts) Wait for me. Good luck. Chuck? Chuck, where are you? I'm on my way, buddy. Here to see someone in the building? (panting): Well... Yeah. Yeah, kinda. I'm here to meet... Meet my friend. Chuck. Does this chuck work here? He could work here. He might. Okay, pal. Take it easy. I'm building security. My name's julius. What's the problem? You can tell me. (sighs) I'm involved in something really messed up, man. Been lying to my wife. Been lying to everybody. I can't take it anymore. Because of this chuck guy? Yeah. Yeah, chuck. I think I understand. Look, pal, If you really love this chuck, You have to tell your wife. You can't live a lie. Trust me, I've been there. That's not really what I mean. Sure, it isn't. (silenced gunshots) (groans) Oh! Chuck! You killed julius! What? Kill?! I would never do that. It's a tranq gun. (gun firing, groans) That's preposterous. Killing someone. Come on. Bingo. All right, He's going to be fine. Come on. Â¶ Â¶ So, what do you think is up there? Something pretty gnarly, huh? It's best not to speculate. I mean, nine times out of ten-- Well, seven-- You get yourself all worked up over nothing. (elevator bell dings) See? Nothing to worry about. Man: Hey, you're not allowed up here! (silenced gunshots) (heavy breathing) Look out. Dude, you're incredible! Was that your spy training? Duck hunt. Nintendo. (beeping) Devon? Yes, sydney. Good, you're alive. Down the hall to your left is an unmarked door. The lock works via retina scan. Cut out one of the guards' eyes And use it to open the door. What? We got to cut out one of these guys' eyes for the scan! I took an oath, bro. I can't cut out a man's eye. I got a better idea. Captain (strains): Jeez, this guy's heavy. Yeah. Well, bad guys don't count carbs, buddy. (mechanical whirring) (sighs) (heavy breathing) Sarah, we have reached the 12th floor, But what the heck is going on? This is a cia facility. Sarah? Hello? Chuck? Hello? I lost him. (beeping) Tracked her. She's... She's right here. Sarah: That's her. (doors, windows clicking) let's go! What the hell?! Casey, walker. Stand down. General, we have a visual on sydney. She just walked past us. She's heading inside the building. I've just received new mission information, colonel. Your new directive is to stand down. General, chuck has reached the 12th floor, And he says it's some kind of cia base. If that's true, then this is some kind of a setup. Yes, that's exactly what this is. Excellent work, devon. You're almost finished. There's a man in the office at the end of the hall. Chuck, sydney says there's a man in the office At the end of the hall. Find him. And kill him. Chuck, she wants us to find him and kill him. Nobody's going to kill anybody, okay? Just calm down and stay close. Excuse me, sir? Excuse me, I know this is a little awkward, But don't move. But also don't be afraid. My name is... Chuck. Chuck bartowski. I know. How... How do you... How do you know that? I know things, lots of things, about you, about them. What-what do you know about the ring? What are they doing here? What do they want? Why do they need devon? They don't need anything. They already have everything. Simple as that. Now, sydney will be here any minute. We've got to do this. Syd-sydney's coming here? You know she wants me to kill you, right? But don't worry, I'm-I'm not gonna do that. However, we do need a plan. I've got one. You're going to kill me, chuck. What? No. No, no, no, no. I don't kill people. Okay? I have rules against such things. Shoot me. Here. Try to be precise. Are you listening to anything I'm saying right now? I don't kill people. Therefore, I don't shoot them. Maybe with a tranq gun. I'll tranq anybody you want. But a gun-gun. I hate gun-guns. Listen, if you don't kill me now, You and devon are as good as dead. Well, I'm not gonna do it! Chuck. I have to die. Now. The ring knows too much. There's no other way. So, just do it. Shoot me. (heavy breathing) I-I-I can't do it. I can't do it. Afterward, put the gun in devon's hands, then hide. When she's leaves, open this. Truth is, I hate guns, too. Who are you? (gasps, body thuds) Chuck! Huh? What? What, no, I didn't-- no! That's not me, I didn't shoot him, I swear! He's dead. Chuck, this is not a tranq gun. (door opening) (footsteps approaching) Okay, listen to me. Remember, you shot him. Gun? Take off the watch. Well done. Cute and talented. (beeps) What a catch. (sighs) Lose the body, keep the phone. We'll be in touch. Welcome to the ring. (exhaling loudly) Chuck, chuck, what the hell is going on right now? "med kit in desk. The pill was amiodarone. Save me"? Amiodarone. Amiodarone stops your heart, Only momentarily though. If it's a clean shot I think I can save him. Here. (gasping) (groaning) To answer your question, My name is shaw. I would like to introduce you all To cia special agent daniel shaw. For the last five years, he has worked on nothing But taking out the ring. From this point on, agent shaw has total command authority On any mission having anything to do with the ring. Really? This guy? I have back issues Of guns & ammo older than he is. Be that as it may, you should all know That I've been fully briefed on the details of the intersect. That's right. I know everything. Thank you very much, general. I'll take it from here. Colonel, walker, chuck, you're in good hands. Good luck. Here's an overview of current ring intel. Great, welcome to the team. But sydney is still out there, Which means my brothe r-in-law's still in danger. Not for long. As you've seen, the ring operates Through a network of decentralized cells. If we catch sydney, there's a good chance We can contain devon's identity. He's a bona fide mole in their operation. In order to save him, we have to use him. What? No! No way! I've already been over this. Devon is out of the spy business For good. Chuck, As long as sydney is alive, Devon is a marked man. She's right, chuck. Casey, sarah, please! Explain the risks to him. The risks are greater for devon if we don't use him. Sydney would sooner kill him Than let him go. Well, I don't care. He's not a spy. Well, chuck, then I guess the question is: Do you have a better plan? Morgan: Where in the hell is everyone?</i> (distant cheering and shouting) What is that? Â¶ Â¶ (grunting and cheering) A fight club? No, no! No! We cannot have this, guys! Come on, there's, you know, insurance issues. (crowd booing) Who's next?! Who wants to regain their manhood? Lester, come on, man, We talked about this. We can't have this anymore. You have to cut this out! You can. (crowd cheers) It's like I'm talking to a wall. (crowd cheering) Lester, a little help, please. No, no! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Morgan: Don't... (electrical crackling) Don't... Do not hook that up. I'm trying to help them. (screaming) Okay, no, no! Hey, listen to me, back to work! All right, fight club is over! Lester: Over? Nothing's over till we say it's over. You may have shut this down, but you will never Shut us down. Ass man. (snaps fingers) Yeah. Oh. (electrical crackling) nice. You could at least unplug the battery! (knocking) hey. What's up? Everything okay? Please don't say another mission, chuck. I can't take this anymore. I'm kind of freaking out. Don't worry, no. No more missions. I'm sorry that I put you through all this But I promised you that I would take care of it, and I am. Give me the phone. Thanks. Morgan: Chuck, you in there? Oh, there you are. Been looking all over for you. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? 'cause I'm in a crisis. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so am I. Yeah, of course you are. My man, still working. An assistant manager's dream. On to my nightmare. Uh, lester turned the cage into a fight club And attached a battery to the fence so he can shock people. (inhales deeply) You smell that? That's burnt human hair, dude. I told them to stop and no one will listen to me. Okay, no one will listen to anything that I have to say. My job is on the line here. Yeah, well, it sounds like you need a plan, buddy. Exactly. That's exactly what I need. Dude, I was thinking, I was, like, You know, I probably need a plan here but what plan? You know? (beeping) You know-you know sometimes What I like to do is-is, uh, open up a problem And really examine it. Find its weak points. And then not be afraid to just attack it head-on. Wow. Wow. That's some powerful stuff. Yeah, I think that'll work. Thanks, man. Yeah, buddy. (beeping) Sydney: How did you activate this phone? Who is this? I'm the spy who killed agent shaw. This is not devon woodcomb. Yeah, well, you've been dealing with the wrong man. Devon was a decoy. I'm the one who put that bullet Through agent shaw's chest last night. I'm the spy that you're looking for. And I am in charge of this mission now. Hey, hey, sarah, uh, it's chuck. Don't be mad at me, but I may or may not have called sydney On the ringphone so she would track me here to the buy more. It's a trap, my trap. You told sydney to go to the buy more? Oh, my god, it worked. They're here. Okay, grab casey And get up here so we can take them out. No, chuck, what are you, crazy? Not very smart, chuck. This is not how I do business. You start things on your own, You better be prepared to finish them... On your own. Good luck. He hung up on me. Casey: What are you doing? Without us, he doesn't have a chance. He's gonna start to panic And then he's not gonna be able to perform properly. Yeah, happens to lots of guys. Or so I hear. Besides, I'm kinda curious about what his plan is. Chuck: This isn't part of the plan. Oh, this is very, very bad. Chuck (over p.A.): Hello, sydney. Welcome to the burbank buy more. Please proceed directly to the home theater room. Find him. I would suggest the best way Of getting to the home theater room Is through the mp3/... Aisle, But beware... You break it, you buy it. Hello, sir. Store's closed at the moment But if you want to come back in the morning, We'll be open around 10:00... You're signing his death warrant, You know that, don't you? Ye of little faith. This is crazy. I'm going in. So am I. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you two to stand down. I don't like guns much, But when necessary, I will use them. Finally, we meet. In an electronics store. Which is different. No matter. When we last chatted, you mentioned a certain agent shaw. That's right. Because I'm the one who ended shaw's life, Not devon woodcomb. He was just a patsy. You took out shaw? Mr. Buy more? In a nutshell. I mean, that's kind of what happened. Well, then, if that's true, You won't have any problem with glen and ian here. Glen and ian? Sure. Well, you should know, glen and ian, ian and glen, That if you take one more step, I will drop you. (whispering): Oh, come on, flash. Flash! (chuck groans) (gasps): Okay. Okay, now I'm angry. I'm angry and in a great deal of pain. (panting) Oh. Oh. Oh... (high-pitched, martial arts cries) Get him. That was his plan? You know what? I'm going in. Shoot me if you have to. (gun chamber clicks) casey: Hey! (sighs) You're fast. Something else you should know about me-- I love guns. Good boy. Â¶ Â¶ (grunts) Go! I got these guys. Sydney: Check the cage. Oh! (gun chamber clicks) (groaning) (grunting) (groans) (grunting) (grunting) (panting) (gun chamber clicks) (sighs) (grunts) Stop! Do not move! (panting) Or what? Hmm? Please, just do what I say. (sighs) Spies don't say please. Now, devon-- He would have had a bullet between my eyes by now. All right, fine, your choice-- live or die. (panting) That's better. What are you doing? Do not do that. Do not do that! It's just the phone. You do want it, don't you? Or if you can't think of a use for it, I'm sure I can. I can make a phone call and have 50 operatives here. Don't make me shoot you. I don't think you can. Sarah: Chuck! (gunshot) (body thuds, bullet casings clatter) Like I said, I hate guns, But it pays to know how to use one. I suppose congratulations are in order, chuck. </i> Devon's identity has been contained. We got lucky this time, shaw. Yeah, and risked my family doing it. There's something you need to know about me, shaw. There's nothing in my life That I care about more than my friends and my family. Of course, I don't expect you to understand that. Being the spy that you are, I'm sure that you don't care about anybody. Families and friends make us vulnerable. Make us unable to pull the trigger. And that puts everyone in even greater danger. Just ask your partner here. She'll tell you the same thing. Sometimes it helps to know that you've got something to lose. (rhythmic clicking) (singsongy): Â¶ morgan! Â¶ Â¶ come out and play-ay! Â¶ Â¶ morgan! Â¶ Â¶ come out and play-ay! Â¶ (laughter) Big mike: Grimes! Get over here! You have got to get your house in order, son. I know. I know I do. I-I just... I don't... I don't get it. I thought we were all friends here. You ain't. First rule of big mike management: You can't be afraid To pull the trigger. Right? Pull the trigger. Right. Lester, You know, A wise man once told me that you need to assess a problem And then attack it head-on. Hmm. You... Are a problem. Oh. Your behavior will no longer be tolerated. So, here are the first, second And third rules of the buy more. Do what you're told, Do it with respect, or... Or what? Hmm? You'll fight me? (laughter) (laughing) No, I'll fire you. You don't have the cojones. Yeah. No, you're fired. Pack your hard drives And get out of here. The rest of you, back to work. Morgan, morgan, morgan, morgan, come on, man. Okay, look, hey. We're just having a little fun. Okay? I take it back. I take it back. Good-bye, lester. Dude, don't do this. Don't do this, okay? You know I need this job. I got to get out of my mom's place. Hmm. For god's sake, man, I've got nowhere else to go! I've got nowhere else to go! Yeah, okay, you're rehired. (sighs) But you're on probation. Okay. Double-secret. Double-secret?! Â¶ Â¶ Strong. Real strong. (barks) Was that...? A bigger dog, a medium-sized dog. Bigger? Â¶ Â¶ (knocking on door) Morgan: Hey, chuck, can you grab that, dude? I'm-I'm wokin' and rollin' over here. Hi-dilly-ho, neighbors. Hi. Morgan: Yeah, hey, guys. Welcome to our-- formerly-your-- home. I hope everybody is hungry, Because I made my teriyaki surprise. The surprise is the teriyaki. Think I've had enough surprises lately. Oh, devon, stop it. I'm sure we'll love it, morgan. Mostly sure. Hey, uh, buddy, That thing that we were dealing with? It's been taken care of. We caught her. Everything's gonna be just fine. (sighs) Oh. There... There it is. That's enough of that. Hey, what-what am I, chopped scallions over here? There's no love for buy more's new assistant manager, or...? What? That's great. Congratulations. Assistant manager? Congratulations, buddy. Honey, you're hurting him. Put him down. Oh. (knocking on door) Oh, uh, el, I hope you don't mind, but I-I invited sarah, As well. Oh, really? I'll get the door. (clears throat) oh, casey, too. What?! Hi, ellie. Hi, sarah. Good to see you. Hello, ellie. Casey. You've had enough of that. (whispers): What's with her? No idea. Hi. Hi. It wouldn't have been the same without you, so, I'm really glad you made it.
