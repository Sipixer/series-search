For the record, I'm not Cabal. - Dana Whitcomb. - <i>You have my daughter.</i> - <i>I want her back.</i> - Your daughter... or your work? What are you still doing here? I thought you were going to evacuate with the other residents.</i> She wasn't supposed to be here. Please... Mom... It's a miracle. Mom... Welcome home. The repairs on the Beijing Sanctuary will be finished in March. And how long before the Moscow and London Sanctuaries are reopened? Three months, provided the contractors hold to their estimates. Tokyo, however, is a total loss. Which means we have a lot of dispossessed residents to deal with. The Sanctuary network survived. That's what matters most. It's just... hard to keep that in mind sometimes. - So many tragedies to process. - I take it that's our cargo. No, ours is in the hold. I've got five trucks waiting, so... And the rest? Magnus said you requested space for 20 abnormal refugees. Not 20 abnormals... 20 containers of abnormals. I can see the light. Now, that's better. Man, was it hot in there! Boy, I could sure do with a lemonade. Yo, Beijing, what's a guy gotta do to get a cold drink around here, huh? You're a lot of help. I'm out of here. See you. We're going to need some more trucks. The Team Projet-SG presents: Sanctuary - Season 2 Episode 3 Eulogy (v. 1.00) Timing by: Arrow, nitrogenc, Salomon Stop doting on me. - It makes my teeth itch. - Mine too. Now, eat. I should be helping Henry and Will. They're fine. Everything's running smooth as silk. No, you don't. This is a freaking mess. So many wonderful guests! We got to figure out a tagging system, 'cause half these things shouldn't even be breathing the same air. Come and get it, shorty! I'm short? So all grade four security risks are in the Shoe. How's the food and water holding up? Down, Smithers. Sit! All right. I pulled in big favors from our suppliers. Got... Yeah, he's not well. God... I hope the plumbing holds up. I'm not worried about that. Magnus isn't letting me reset the EM shield. It's still set to high security mode. You have any idea what kind of drain that is on our electrical system? I'm sure Magnus is not overly concerned about the utility bill right now. I'm just saying, we can't even plug in a toaster without blowing a fuse. I got 15 guests on the upper levels, another dozen in trucks... I know, okay? Everything's a mess right now, but we can handle it. Really? Tell that to the 12 guys waiting... We can handle it, okay? Let's just give 110% and take it one game at a time. Okay, one game at a time. - It's time for you to be the man. - Be the man. Look out! - Smithers, come on! - Would you... Could you... Sorry... About him. All right, be the man. Be the man... Good times. This is why we ask for a cleaning deposit from you when you check in. So you're really going, huh? I can't exactly stay. The whole attack on this place, me shooting the boss' kid with a rocket, the kid going boom... Things are just too... weird now. Things are usually weird around here, but I agree, they're especially weird right now. I appreciate you guys letting me stay here as long as you have, - but you need room at the inn, so... - Kate, do you want to stay here? Why do you ask? You've taken your sweet time leaving. You've obviously made yourself at home. I don't know. The leg's still a bit stiff. I was planning on waiting until I was in peak condition before shipping out. Whatever. If you're leaving, clean the place up, and if you're staying, clean the place up. Garbage pickup's at 4:00. Good to know. "Garbage pickup is at 4:00." Are we going to do this now? Fine, and don't bare your teeth at me! I know what that means! Please, Will, come in. We'll discuss this later. God... I know you've had your hands full, and I really appreciate you all giving me some time, and I'm hardly the only one personally affected by recent events. We haven't spoken since Clara's memorial service. Yeah, which was five days ago. Magnus, what happened was... The worst thing I could imagine, but it happened, and you mourning Ashley alone is not going to do yourself or anyone else any good. - Without closure... - I know all of that. Why are you delaying the inevitable? Why are you hiding in here? Simple or complicated version? Your choice. - What are you doing? - I've wanted to tell you that for days, but I had to be sure, and now I am. Of what? I'm not mourning anything, not yet... Because I believe there's a very real chance that Ashley may still be alive. Is that a real, live stenopelhabilis? Not so much alive as dead. These two were the last of their kind. They bought it when London was hit. I didn't even know there was any left in existence. There are many species under our care we prefer people to believe are extinct. No way, you had a male and a female? We were trying to breed them. Dr. Magnus wanted them brought here for study, and safekeeping. What? You don't think I know about the tusks? That's all you see, isn't it? Do you know how much those are worth on the European market alone? And I'm talking for each pair. Forget about Asia, that'd be, like, double the... Who are you? Ark-Fong Li, head of the Beijing Sanctuary, meet Kate Freelander, professional pain in the ass, who I believe was just leaving. I was, but Will asked me to stay a little longer and help out with all the newbies and stuff. Garbage detail. My idea. See ya. How could she have survived? And believe me, I say this... wanting her to be somewhere, anywhere, alive and well. Which could very well be the case. The first attacker teleported at 18:25 hours. Notice the change in the EM field's strength? The second attempted teleport happened less than three minutes later. - Further destabilizing the field. - Exactly. So you're saying the EM field was unstable when... Ashley teleported at 18:29 hours. - You think she got through? - A further analysis needs to be done to determine exactly where she could have landed. I need you to be my emotional compass. We nearly lost the Sanctuary network because of my judgment. I need to know that my instincts aren't wrong. That my feelings don't end up blinding my decisions. Heck, yeah. Come to mama. I'm gonna gag. I'll be damned... Love child of the dead. Come to mama... You little... Fabulous! If we move the Kitapholus Drocena here, we could put the Seroslugs on the third floor by the Lotus Elks. No, Lotus Elk eat Seroslug. What about the cryo-lab? That's the only room that goes to minus 30 degrees. I was hoping to save that for the northern Halcylops. What about the Pradophili? Ape man... And short human guy, I ordered Thai food, like, an hour ago. What, are you clowns on strike, or what? Annoying insect guy, you'll eat when it's your turn to eat. Wait a minute. You hate me because I got wings, don't you? Because I have the freedom of flight and you don't! Yeah, that's why I hate you. Now go back to your shoebox and let us work, please. You gonna eat that? Because I can make a serious smorgasbord with that. Listen, will you go away if I give it to you? Holy jeez! The density of these things. I can feel my deltoids. Hey, sweet cheeks, my room, now! You wish. What happened to you? It seems like the dead female steno was still able to carry a healthy baby, and Mazel Tov, she had one. That's great! We should put it in an incubator or something. Slight problem. It got away. Say again? I tried to stop it, but the little bugger tried to eat me. They were all in stasis. Mom was in stasis. Junior, as it turns out, not so much. This is not good. This is not good. We have to find it before it gets eaten by something, or vice versa. What were you doing down there? That is a very... Astute question. Perhaps you'd like to sell me too? Maybe. A baby stenopelhabilis. How in the world? That's nasty food. Not good for you at all. Here, now. Here, just let me... I know that look. Just spill it. What do you think happens after we die? You've seen more lives end than anyone else that I know. Kurt and Albert and I got into this discussion once at a Princeton football game. I think it was 1953. Albert argued that the concept of matter equaling energy, and vice versa, was far more ubiquitous than any of us could have imagined. That would be Kurt Godel and Albert Einstein? Of course. I'm a guy hammering in stakes here. You want to have a little mercy? What do I think death is? Did you ever see "Field of Dreams"? - I loved that movie. - The cornfield. It's rather like that. I never understood what happened in the cornfield. Nobody did. That was the point. You're missing out on all the fun. There's food if you're hungry. Dr. Li can patch you up if you're injured. I haven't the time. I wonder why. You'll be pleased to know Nikola and I are making significant headway into the Cabal's operations. Individual cells exist, but the central brain trust has... been undone. You're killing them off. They exist only as disparate, disconnected camps now. And Dana Whitcomb? A fugitive, but it's only a matter of time. She will answer for what she's done. With her life? Will that help? On second thought, don't answer that. Perhaps once I've found her, I'll simply hand her over to the authorities? I don't need your blessing! There is a part of you that's dying for the moment I come and tell you it's done. I'm choosing to focus on other things, John, like rebuilding. Then plan Ashley's funeral. Not yet. Not until I say. - This delusional game you're playing... - There is a chance... Is there really? You may have been able to convince these others to follow you down this perverse rabbit hole, but I will not! They took her from us in the most unnatural way possible! I'm doing my part. Do yours. Gas station's five miles back. Actually, I'm trying to find Tehuatonichen. My information says it's in this area. Am I close? Ain't nothin' round here but desert. We'll track the steno, and we'll bag it with snares, or if we have to, we'll use a shock web. Definitely not, and please, gently with the snares. We don't want to hurt it. Dude... Snares? It's a steno. I say you set the phasers to 11 and fry the sucker. It was defending itself, most likely from being sold on the black market by you. We need some bait. We were feeding its parents bamboo leaves and shoots... Or my day-old hamburger... Shush. As I was saying, we have several rare genera of bamboo from the southern Yangtze region which I'm sure it will find very delicious. Let's just get this thing back in a cage before it gets eaten by something hungrier and bigger. I'm telling you, burgers! Thanks for the tip. And the whole snare thing, big mistake! I can't see anything here. There's no evidence in the bio-scanner of Ashley escaping the EM field perimeter. I've been looking at this from the wrong point of view. I thought the field de-stabilization could have allow her to go through it. - What else could it mean? - That she simply bounced back within the field itself, re-materialized somewhere inside the Sanctuary. Think about it. Why did the field weaken at the exact moment that she teleported? An anomaly? A power surge because she was taking one of the super abnormals - with her at the time? - You're reaching. All we need to do is search for elements of Ashley's DNA inside the Sanctuary. You're reaching. We have had a work crew in the Sanctuary for a week and no one has found anything that could possibly be construed as a body. But they haven't been everywhere. She could be disoriented... Or hurt. Or gone. Do you really want me to stop? Ground floor, lower level secured. Okay, good. Dr. Li? No sign yet. Perhaps it's sleeping somewhere. They only sleep at night. It will definitely be awake. Everybody stay in touch. Wait, wait, wait. I have him. Can you get it? All right. All right... On the move, going for the lower levels. Big Guy, it's headed your way! Ready. Got you, you little... - What happened? - It jumped. - It can't jump. Stenos don't do that. - This one did. Damn it. It's in the vent system. - Can't you just trap it in there? - Not fast enough. This is very bad. Great. It's gone. Well, you clearly don't need my help. This is a disaster. The Titanic's a disaster. Madonna's movie career, disaster. This is nothing. You don't get it, do you? I'm supposed to be the man, and losing a one-of-a-kind baby steno does not exactly make me "the man". Quite a predicament. If only you had the services of a world-class hunter/tracker at your disposal. Name your price. Never say that to me unless you mean it. I'm saying it. Mommy and daddy's tusks. No. No way. The bamboo salesman and the giant walking rug are running the Sanctuary, and I'm right here, healthy, willing and able. Come on, Henry, do you wanna be the man or not? - One steno tusk. One. - Two sets of two, or it's not worth it. One set... - The female. - Fine. Let's roll! Once the scan is complete, any biological artifacts matching Ashley's DNA should show up. If we do find something, how do we know that it's not from one of the super abnormals? Didn't they share Ashley's DNA? I'm hopeful that there are ways to tell the difference. Either way, we should have a good idea of what really happened. I can't tell if this is a real investigation or a train wreck. Look, I'm sorry, I didn't... Never stop doing that, being honest with me. Anything else, and I will be insulted. Thanks. Sancho Panza had it easy. Ashley and I always had to face tragedy and loss in our work. I taught her a saying... "Nos must amitto vivo en." "We must let go to live on." Well done, Sancho. You know, she always faced death better than me, among many things. That must've been hard, just you and her. It was worth every minute. There has been an incident at Vera's Burger Shack</i> on Salisbury. Just let me handle the cops, okay? - Can I help you folks? - Health Department. We got a call about a code violation. Okay, go ahead. - Health Department? - No one ever checks. - So, what did I tell you? Burgers. - Okay, Shush. It happened only 20 minutes ago. It couldn't have gotten far. Especially if it just ate. Is it just me, or has its shoe size gone up? We're going to need a bigger cage. Just chowed down, been on the run for a while. If I was a full, tired critter, - I'd want a place to lay low for a bit. - Make a nest. I'm thinking yeah. Made it myself. I'm not hungry, thank you. Will, would you please stop hovering? I can take care of myself. You've barely eaten for six days. You've had hardly any sleep. Even for you, this is extreme. - I'm fine. - Yes and no. You've got a clear mind, good focus, but you also... You drift off - now and again. You leave. - It's just memories. - If this bio-scan comes up empty... - What theory will I cook up next to keep this quest alive? - No, I wasn't saying that. - Yes, you were. I need to know, are you searching for closure... or a miracle? There are no such thing as miracles. It's found something. The coordinates say it should be right... There. Oh, my God. Once you get it free, bring it to the lab. I'll run a full autopsy. I'll meet you there. - Big guy, if you want me to do this... - No. Okay, I draw the line. Come on. Big kudos to the consultant. You were right about it trying to find a place to lay low. That's a sewer down there. City worker gets attacked in the sewer. We go into the sewers. And the stink that never comes out of your clothes? Are we ignoring the need for new wardrobe? Get in the hole. But not with this. Come on. Get with the program, please. Hank, reality check. This thing just sent a fry cook and a sewer worker to the emergency room with lacerations. It's obviously way nastier than it was this morning. You want the tusks or not? Anything? The remains are too burnt to determine a fingerprint pattern. - What about you? - X-rays we were able to recover. Tissue analysis and bone density results will take a little more time. - This isn't Ashley. - How can you tell? Ashley broke her right femur when she was 12 years old. This one shows no evidence of re-calcification. These are the remains of one of the other abnormals that attacked us. Okay, well, it's something. Look, I know you were hoping for something else, but... I'm feeling quite tired, Will. I think I'll lie down for a while. These fries look almost fresh. It's got to be close. Once we do bag it, breaking it from its junk food habit is going to be a bitch. All right, these tunnels rejoin a couple blocks south of here, You take left, I'll go right. We'll flush it out on the other side. Sounds like a plan. - Keep in touch, and remember... - Stun, no gun. I got it. Great. Policy-schmolicy. Hello. What are you looking for? A place that doesn't exist, apparently. Tehuatonichen. You're right. It doesn't exist. And yet, you've heard of it. Einstein was right. - Matter into energy. - Right. - But landing where? - The EM field itself. That's what the fluctuation means. That's why I keep seeing... The magnitude and amplitude of the field increased at the time of her jump. EM fields absorb energy. She could be somewhere in the EM field's buffer, trapped mid-teleport. - In the computer? - Exactly. That's insane. Ashley teleported with another super abnormal. The fluctuation could be the EM field's buffer capturing both signatures and storing them... Even if she is in here, somehow, what are you gonna do? You're gonna try to communicate, to pull her out somehow? If we could recreate her signature effectively, - there may be a way to... - To what? There are so many variables to consider, Will, so many pieces to this puzzle. One more test. I run an exponential wave analysis. I search the EM field for her particular... What next? Come on, Junior... Easy, now... Let's take this nice and slow. Do you want a piece of me, boy? Do you? You're a boy, right? So, it's bigger. Move! Move, move! I thought you said no guns! I said no guns for you. Get off of me. Where the hell are we? I don't know. Looks like your room. These are my jeans. Oh, man. - What? - I think we found its nest. We got to get out of here. Why didn't it kill you in the tunnel back there? - It's coming! - Yeah, I know. Just hold on a sec! I'm gonna empty a mag into it! - No, you are not! - Yeah, I am! Food, water, shelter... Wait! What the hell? Look around you. What's the first thing it did? It licked your face, ate your food, stole your clothes. You were the first thing it saw. It thinks you're its mother. I think it has your eyes. Barf. Get off. I came to return this to you. It was given to me in the Amazon. He was Sani, our last living Shaman, spirit leader of our tribe. I was asked to bring him home. For 300 years, we've been waiting for his return. This means my ancestors will be at peace. We want you to have this. It was meant for you. May it guide you through dark places and into the light. You should see this. {\No sign of requested energy signature within electromagnetic field.} I'm truly sorry, Magnus. Tell everyone the memorial service will be tomorrow. I need to reset the EM field. There's your rare baby, Dr. Li, intact and everything. You've traumatized it. It keeps showing its teeth. To you, not to me. You're just jealous because Ralphie chose me for its mother. You don't even know what gender it is. Does it really matter? It's got a ring to it. You're growing on him. Feels good, doesn't it? Being a good guy? I got to admit, you're pretty good at this. Back at ya, Hank. You gonna stick around? Well, I got to get paid, don't I? Right. A deal's a deal. One steno set. Have fun in Maui. Tell you what, hang onto them for me. I'll collect them later. See you, baby. I see you've come to your senses. Interesting turn of phrase. All my senses tell me that she's still alive, - somewhere... - Stop. Please. In the end, what she chose to do, she did as Ashley, not what they turned her into. Please take some solace in that. I think not. Are you joining us? You may have found closure. I haven't. Not yet. Nos must amitto vivo en. We must let go. I can't. You have to, mom. But you're... You're my life. - Without you... - You'll never be without me, and I know that you will always love me.
