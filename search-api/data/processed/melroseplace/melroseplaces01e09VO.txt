You are a hugely talented filmmaker. We're getting married, guys. You called your dad? Get in the car! Look at you. Paddock watch, the Prada. You're getting your money somewhere. If you need to go out and take what's not yours, there's something missing in your life. - I'm concerned about finances. - I work it out. You're gonna be going to a party tonight. The client's gonna love you. There's a hostess that just quit at Coal. I could put in a good word for you. Oh, my God, Sydney! - Did you know her pretty well? - I met her 4 years ago. She was the one who convinced me I could be a real chef. Who needs Coal? You are way too good for that place. I kissed someone last night. I had the same exact reaction when I found out you kissed Auggie. So, where do we go from here? You're... incredible. Thank you, so are you. What's the rush? You booked two hours. Now I gotta go. But I want you to stay. Thousand dollars if you stay till sunrise. I'm all yours. You're sure they're not gonna be home all day, right? We've done this before, and we've had no problems, right? You have nothing to worry about. I'll see you soon, bye. Dad stick you with the graveyard shift again? Part of the joy of med school. What about you? Where are you off to so early? Oh, Hugo's. Waffles and eggs. Long night of making people feel better? Endless night, actually. Let me see, we had two car accidents, gunshot wound, and a kidney failure all in one shift. You look exhausted. - Are you okay? - I'm still standing. Yeah, for now. Dr. Mancini's got us coming in for rounds in two hours. So I have like 90 minutes uninterrupted sleep ahead of me. Take care of yourself. Did we forget to set this clock back or are you, like, an hour late to class? I have teachers' conferences today. I don't have to go in early. Oh, right, forgot. You gonna work on your treatment for Kendra? Yeah, probably. Where are we, Jonah? I have no idea. We're supposed to be engaged and we're kissing other people? God, I wish none of this had ever happened. Too bad in real life there's no "undo" command. I was thinking, I should maybe take a road trip. Like hike Joshua Tree or something. I was gonna say the opposite, that we go together somewhere. What was that? Police! Get inside! Now, now! Go! Go! Go! Go! LAPD! Go! Go! Go! Get in there! Watch them! Do either of you happen to know where Auggie Kirkpatrick might be? - Why? - We found the murder weapon. - What does that have to do with Auggie? - It was a knife with his blood on it. Mr. Kirkpatrick's wanted for murder. Balibal,Dark_Chii Just-In, Luoleilina Ps!Ko^^, SirHill WoLF971 What would a boy do without his balls? Whatever you have planned for the rest of the day, cancel it. Do I get a why? I got a heads-up from corporate in New York and they wanna a video conference at noon. They want a full rundown on how I'm making the L.A. office more profitable. And you want me to be your wingman? - Talk you up to the New York brass? - Done and done. I've never needed a wingman. What I need for you to do is take over the lunch meeting I was supposed to have with Franz Keppler. You do know who he is, right? The German wunderkind who makes indecipherable indie movies that I would rather pluck my eyes out than sit through. I wouldn't open with that. Franz is white-hot right now that he's about to start rolling on the Bruckheimer blockbuster. I need you to convince him that he needs WPK. A couple of problems. I know nothing about his movies, I speak zero German and lederhosen is not my style. New York's gonna ask me what gets I have lined up. I'm gonna tell them I'm about to bring Franz Keppler into the WPK fold. Don't make your boss a liar. All right, no need to get your jock strap in a knot. I'm on it. Are you sure you know where it is? I got it written down. 1:00, right? But where is the place again? Pasadena Tile on Colorado. I wanna kiss you good-bye, Mommy. Sorry, Miss Vanessa, he's so fast. You want a kiss, you got it, pal! I want Mommy. Oh, come here. Be a good boy today, okay? We'll be back later. Thanks. Come right back. Hola, Leticia. - Â¿Como estas? - I do not feel good about this. It's fine. I'll have him back in a of couple hours. There's my little munchkin! Ready for an adventure with your big brother? - I can get in so much trouble for this. - But you won't. Because no one has to find out. All right, you ready? Let's hit it, pal. - Where are we going? - It's a surprise. Come on. I may not be CSI, but when your blood ends up on the murder weapon along with the victim's blood... you're usually guilty. It doesn't prove anything. What other proof do you need? It's Auggie. He'd never murder someone. Are you forgetting about the night he told you about stabbing a guy in a bar fight? That was self-defense. And look, obviously you're not exactly Mr. Objective when it comes to judging him. I wouldn't put you anywhere near that jury box. I'm just stating facts here, Riley. One being that right after they found that knife, our good friend Auggie seemed to very conveniently disappear. He goes on surfing trips all the time, you know that. How do you know he's surfing? I saw him loading his board and his bag into his van. He could just have been going to the beach. How do you know he's on a trip? Did he tell you he was going somewhere? If you know where he is, you have to tell the police. Why? So they can arrest him and convict him of a crime he didn't commit? It happens all the time. They also convict people for aiding and abetting a fugitive. We all know you have this uncanny ability to see the very best in people, but is that really worth going to prison for?! You have no idea he's even innocent. Yes, I do. I know Auggie. Oh, really? You know Auggie? I get that you're friends and you talk. But think about it. Honestly. How well do you really know that guy? - I gotta go. - Where? Ella's having some kind of emergency. Of course she is. You better hurry. This might actually turn out to be a blessing in disguise. I was talking about spending some time apart. Why not start today? There's one rule that we cannot break, no matter what. It's that we cannot leave this place until we have gone on every single ride. - You got it? - Got it! Good. Why can't we do this every day? That's a little complicated, bud. Auf Wiedersehen, Mr. Miller. That kind of means "good-bye." What's this whole emergency? So there's this German guy that I'm trying to woo... and I know you know all about German cinema. This doesn't sound remotely like an emergency. The real emergency's happening at our building right now. What happened? The cops raided Auggie's apartment this morning. They found the murder weapon with Auggie's blood on it. What? Oh, my God. It's terrible. Is Auggie in jail? He's doing what every innocent person does. Disappear into the ether. Course the only person who thinks Auggie's actually innocent is Riley. Little disagreement between the two lovebirds? I'm getting a little tired of her obsession with him, that's all. I don't blame you. But there is nothing you can do except help your neighbor who's not a murderer... me. So, wait. Who's this Aryan mystery man? Franz Keppler. We're having lunch with him at Coal in 45 minutes. He just won the Palme d'Or. He totally revitalized European cinema. If this is a joke, it's cruel by even your standards. There's no joke. There's just one teeny-weeny catch. You're not the filmmaker, you are Jonah Miller the new publicist at WPK. I don't know a thing about publicity. You don't have to. You talk his movies, I'll talk publicity. We'll be fine. It'll be fabulous. Mr. Walters here presented with mitral valve prolapse of the anterior leaflet. What were the possible complications? Endocarditis makes the surgery more difficult. And...? And, um... Anyone. The patient might have extensive calcium deposits on the valve leaflets, which ups the surgery risk factors. That's it. Very good. All right, that's all. I'll see you all tomorrow. Dr. Levy to Oncology. Just a minute, Miss Yung. - Have you been studying? - Of course. When I chose you, you said you could handle the grind. - I can handle the grind. - Really? Because there's a long list of students who'd give their right arm for your spot. Don't blow it. Oh, my God. Good times, huh? - What the hell are you doing here? - I need one more little favor. Our agreement is very clear. I send you your weekly payments, and you stay the hell away from me and my family. But I had to come see you in person. You won't return my phone calls. You know what? This sick little game of yours is starting to piss me off. I'm supporting another child. Don't think I'm not appreciative. Your money has been so helpful. I just bought some awesome new furniture. So let me guess, you need more money. Right? I need a lawyer. I have a court case coming up. What for? The cops came after me for some little thing I did up in Oregon. And now, they're saying I, like, resisted arrest. It doesn't even matter. But I figure, you're this big-time doctor, you probably have tons of important patients, including lawyers. You expect me to find a lawyer for you? The person who's blackmailing me? Go to hell. Actually, it's your marriage that goes to hell once I send your wife our little video. People like you, they don't get away with this kind of behavior. It comes back to haunt you. You would know. My court date's December 11'th. Your choice, Doctor. Either get me a lawyer, or I get you divorced. Enjoy your lunch! There's our Bavarian buddy. My gosh, I can't believe I'm about to have lunch with Franz Keppler. Control the drool, and remember, you're a publicist, not a fan boy. I know. Franz? Oh, hello. Caleb didn't tell me how beautiful the publicist would be. He is a man of few words. Anyway, this is my associate, Jonah Miller, who also happens to be one of your biggest fans. It's true. Das Lied is one of my favorite thrillers, like, of all time. Thank you. Come, let... you know, let's sit. Yeah, with Das Lied I was, trying to make a movie that was visually striking, mesmerizing. Kind of like your eyes. Danke schÃ¶n. So, congratulations on the Bruckheimer movie. No doubt that it is going to be a hit, but we need to make sure that you are getting the accolades that you deserve. It's not just a Matt Damon movie. This is a film by Franz Keppler. You're confident. It's what I do. I like that. Ella is an amazing publicist. - Thank you. - She's the best. And one of the most inventive filmmakers of his generation deserves the best. Uh, but, Franz, your use of shadows... it makes Fritz Lang look like an amateur. You're too kind, Jonah. Which must make you the naughty one. You nailed it, Franz. Ella is naughty. Why do you think I proposed to her? Couldn't let her get away. Like I would ever stray from you. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. You were a couple. - I thought you were colleagues. - We just try to keep a low profile. You know, keep it professional. But in reality, he cannot keep his hands off of me. I don't blame him. Okay, boys, let's relax our trousers and get down to business. Like the juggernaut, otherwise known as Franz Keppler's career. Cheers. Cheers. Vive la Franz! Unbelievable, huh? Murder? Auggie? I know. He would never do something like this. I guess the police are coming up empty in their investigation, so... They're trying to pin it on Auggie? They're desperate. And stupid. Listen, Violet, I wanted to talk to you about Auggie. What about him? You guys work together. Has he been... I don't know, acting strange lately? He's been Auggie. I mean, yeah, he got in that fight with Marcello, but Auggie had no choice. What fight with Marcello? Last night. Auggie finally got fed up with Marcello taking credit for his recipes, and he taught him a lesson. Is Marcello okay? Broken nose, couple of broken ribs. Auggie may have lost his job, but Marcello got what he deserved. I took care of Auggie last night, though. Auggie and I have become... intimate. Look over there! How about getting one of those? Yeah one of those. The blue one. That was so fun! We were way up there, huh? I think I saw my house. I think I saw the North Pole. And Santa Claus was shoveling his driveway. He only comes in winter. What? Can you win me a prize? I'll win you a prize. You got it. Come on, pal. Wait, one second, Noah. Leticia, what's up? They're not home, are they? Okay, good. No, we're fine. Get down from there, pal. We'll be home in, like, an hour. And the good news is you won't have to feed him for a week. He's eaten his weight in corndogs. You okay, buddy? You're gonna be okay. We're here, buddy. We're gonna get some help, all right? I'm looking for Lauren Yung. She's a med student, part of Dr. Mancini's team. - ER's this way. - All right, buddy. When you called you left out the part about how this happened. It doesn't matter. He said that his arm hurts real bad. Okay, just relax. Pulled some strings, we can get him in straight away. - We can take it from here. - Wait over there. Unless you're a guardian, it's not really policy. - I'm not leaving him... - It's okay. Check his vitals, get me a chem 20, do an A.P. and a lateral, left arm. He also threw up in the car ride over. It's probably all the junk he ate. - Could also be a concussion. - What? - I didn't see him hit his head. - I'm going to take care of him. Add a CT scan. My dad doesn't know that I took Noah. He's about to. They're calling him as we speak. Maybe you shouldn't have anything to do with this. If you want to step out and have another doctor come in... The child needs medical care. I'm giving it to him. Auggie, it's me. I just want you to know I'm totally here for you, and I know it's only been 24 hours since we last saw each other, but... I miss you. Call me. Nice furniture. Love what I've done with the place. - Did you find me a lawyer? - Oh, didn't need to. I checked out the details of your hearing, and it turns out I know the judge that's scheduled to preside over it. - What does that get me? - I actually met Judge Davis the day I did a quadruple bypass on Mrs. Davis. Needless to say, the good judge was extremely grateful. That's perfect. Eh, that depends. See, Judge Davis has the utmost trust in me, and I'm your character witness, - either way. - What do you mean? That I can tell him that the Violet Foster I know is a poor, disinherited orphan and should have the justice system smile upon her. - Thank you. - Or... I can tell him that Violet is a sick and twisted menace to society that should be locked up. Your move. Fine. And now we're done. Your days of milking me for money are over. Now, if even one single frame of that video shows up anywhere, I call Judge Davis and he throws your devious little ass in jail. Who says doctors don't make house calls anymore? So tell me, how did you guys meet? At my apartment building, actually. Well, he had a girlfriend at the time, but as soon as I saw that adorable smile, I just knew. You know what? I'm thinking of doing a romantic comedy, and looking at you two, I have found my inspiration. Did you hear that? - I did. - It's nice to meet you. And Ella, my dear... - Franz, oh, very sweet. - Very nice to meet you. I'm going to put some serious thought into working with WPK. Jonah, hang on to her tight, yeah? She is worth keeping. Auf Wiedersehen, Franz. Call me at the office tomorrow. Ja, ja. Always knew you were destined to win an Oscar someday, but I never thought it would be for acting. Bravo. I had to come up with a way to stop Franz from slipping you the wiener schnitzel before salad was served. I was talking about pretending to be a publicist. Jonah, hi, it's me, Ella. You actually think some horny director would ever faze me? I deal with guys like that all the time in my sleep. I think that you put your arm around me and pretended to be my beau because secretly it's what you wanted - since the day that we met. - You are drunk. Aren't you? Funny thing is, is that you and I as a couple... completely natural. Franz totally bought it. After drinking an entire vat of wine, I think he'd buy anything we sold him. Jonah, come on. Give us a little bit of credit. You and I at that lunch were completely compatible. More than I can say about some real couples I know. And by that, you mean me and Riley? It's pretty obvious that the two of you have been having problems since the day you asked her to marry you. It's not exactly my definition of compatibility. Maybe it's time that you explore some other options, the operative word being "explore." Okay, uh, what's that supposed to mean? Well, Hotel Andaz is right down the street. I can... cancel the rest of my meetings, you can clear the rest of your day, and you can finally experience what you've been missing... all this time. Oh, Jonah, come on. You can't tell me that you haven't at least fantasized about the idea. I'm engaged. Remember that minor little detail? What does "engaged" even mean... giving your college sweetheart a ring because you're insecure about your career and you're hoping that she'll bring you some sense of security? Is that why you think I proposed to Riley? Absolutely. Jonah, you guys are nothing alike. Okay, look, we might be going through some growing pains right now, but it's nothing that's not normal for any couple planning a wedding. Nothing about you is normal, and everything about her is painfully normal. - El, you are so out of line right now. - Am I? You... are this brilliant, passionate, creative type who seeks adventure and, and, an-and excitement, and Riley is this mellow, laid-back schoolteacher whose idea of a fun night i-is grading spelling tests. Okay, look... say whatever you want about me, I don't care. Don't you ever bad-mouth Riley. If you have a problem with the fact that I'm in love with her, then it's just that... it's your problem. The only reason I am even out here all day alone with you is because Riley trusts me, and I trust Riley. That's the reason she's the person I'm meant to be with, the only person I'm meant to be with. To: AugKirk Hey, U there? AugKirk Yeah. What's up. To: AugKirk What u doing in Mexico? AugKirk Struggling. Riles17 Struggling with...? AugKirk I've ruined my life. To: AugKirk What did you do? AugKirk I'd rather not say. Don't worry, he'll be good as new in no time. I can keep an eye on him if you want to go to the commissary. The coffee's semi-toxic, but it's caffeinated. No, I'm good. Oh, my God, Noah. It's okay. Mommy and Daddy are here now. Sweetie... - How you doing, buddy? - Mommy? Can I... is it all right to hold him? He really shouldn't be moved. He's got a, a hairline fracture to the ulna and a mild concussion. You are never to come near Noah again, is that clear? If you ever pull something this reckless again, so help me God, I will press charges. The last thing I ever wanted was for him to get hurt. What were you thinking? I wasn't. I just wanted to spend time with him. I wanted to be a brother. Okay? I screwed up. I love him. You have an odd way of showing it. Good work, Yung. I'm in here. You okay? No, not really. Who are you calling? No one. Yet. It's Auggie, huh? You're calling to warn him? I IM'd him. I meant it when I said that I wasn't going to have anything to do with Auggie, but... He's your friend. I get it. You believe in him, so I believe in you. If you don't think he did it, I don't think he did, either. I trust you, Riley, because, in the same exact situation, I'd want you to trust me. The Ims Auggie sent me back... they were kind of scary. Maybe I don't know him as well as I thought. Maybe he did hurt Sydney. But, if he did do it, and he ends up hurting someone else because I kept my mouth shut, I couldn't live with myself. At the end of the day, you were right. It's not up to me to decide whether or not he's innocent. Whatever you decide to do... I'm here for you. Detective Rodriguez, please. Ah, Simms, there you are. Oh, God. You brought me in here to talk football? Franz Keppler just called. He's coming to WPK. Not only did he love your pitch, but he especially loved your... boyfriend? Invite me to one of your slumber parties... we'll have a pint and share boyfriend stories. He said his name was Jonah. That wouldn't happen to be Jonah Miller, the director of the Anton V EPK - and the Boomkat video savior, would it? - The one and only. I'm impressed, Simms. He's absolutely adorable. Yeah, he is, but, um... But nothing. He's brilliant, he's charming. He's a very talented director. You know something? You've actually got good taste in men. I have very good taste in everything, Caleb, but the truth is, is that Jonah is engaged. You're a bad girl, aren't you? I'm not a home wrecker, and Jonah is not my boyfriend. Okay? He's just a friend who was protecting me from Franz's groping. He's a hot-blooded, heterosexual male. Engaged or not, if he's pretending to be your boyfriend, then he wants to be. Oh, well, then, that's his problem. Because Jonah Miller is so not my type. Please. Sorry. Did I get your book wet? That's okay. I've dropped my fair share of books in the deep end. That's what hair dryers are for. You know, I was thinking. Making rent every month is turning out to be harder than I thought. And you're a med student, so money's got to be tight for you, too, right? That's putting it mildly. I was wondering if you and Ella would be interested in having a new roommate. I don't take up too much space, and I promise I don't talk in my sleep. We would have so much fun together. You know, Violet, I'd love to, but, um, I-I don't think Ella's going to be too psyched about sharing the bathroom with one more person. Yeah, I get it. I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask. One shot of tequila. Or 12. I take it you've had about as good a day as me. Oh, no, I've had worse. Especially since the police finally figured out who murdered Sydney. What? Who did it? Have you two been trapped in a vault all day? The police were here this morning raiding Auggie's apartment. The murder weapon had Auggie's blood all over it. They're searching for him as we speak. Oh, my God. That is so messed up. I'm as broken up about it as you are. Did you guys hear about Auggie? We're, like, in shock. Oh, I bet. I mean, Riley, you know Auggie better than all of us. All those morning jogs together. Who knew that you were running with the devil? He's not the devil. Right... Look, I'm, um... I'm sorry about earlier today. I have no idea what got into me, except for three bottles of Pinot Grigio. That much wine, and I go straight for shock value. Well, don't worry about it. I won't. I'm going to go chase my buzz. Can I have a word with you, David? Sure. If you're here for David Beatdown Part Two, can we get on with it? Actually, uh... no. No, I'm not here for that. I stand by what I said at the hospital. What you did was reckless. - You cost Leticia her job. - It's not Leticia's fault. Most importantly, you put Noah's life in danger. You don't think that I feel terrible about that? Do you think that I wanted to hurt him? He's my little brother. I just want to say that, well, I appreciate... that you wanted to spend time with Noah. Anyway... I just wanted to say thank you for, you know, today. It's pretty obvious you're going to be an amazing doctor. Just doing my job. I've known a lot of docs in my day, and... most of them didn't care nearly half as much as you do. I think you're the one who cares. You know? Seeing you with Noah like that today... I didn't think you could be that devoted to someone. Pretty easy to be devoted to a kid like Noah. It's the other million things in my life... that's a different story. You know, David, um... you're obviously smart. Obviously. Seriously. All you have to do, David, is decide what you want to do with your life and apply yourself. Just make sure that, whatever it is, it's legal. You should know that that little hobby of mine, it's over. Good. I'm glad. 'Cause it was going to be really awkward calling the cops on my neighbor. Do you want to know why it's over? Why? 'Cause I don't want you to ever look at me the way you did when you caught me coming out of that house. Ever. I want you to look at me the way you're looking at me now. Are you okay? Did I cross a line? No, it's... it... it's not you. Then, what is it?
