Jonah! You are a hugely talented filmmaker. You're also... the most charming human being I know. You going to come downtown and help teach the Pledge of Allegiance to my first-graders? Will you marry me? I can't believe that girl had to be the one to find her. Poor thing-- she's lived here... 30 seconds? - Did you know her pretty well? - I met her four years ago. She's the one who convinced me I could be a real chef. Daddy's got money, huh? Get in the car! ?? Patek watch, the Prada. You're getting your money somewhere. All my life, all I wanted was to be a doctor. Now the university is telling me that I have to pay in full by the end of the semester or they're going to kick me out. I went on this fancy dinner with this guy, Toby. He offered me $5,000 to have sex with him. Oh, my God. Sydney. You, uh... - on a walk of shame? - Jeez, David, you scared me. Nice step up from the scrubs. I'm guessing you're not coming home from work. I'm guessing you're not, either. Perk of the trust fund, huh? Sleep all day, party all night? Something like that. Jonah. Jonah, wake up. Am I still dreaming, or did you make breakfast? "Made" is strong. I poured. All green clovers? That's like... miraculous. I had to sift through three boxes, but after leaving you hanging all day before I said yes, I figured you deserved breakfast in bed. Plus... a day off to celebrate engagementhood with your future wife. What about school? Your first-graders are going to be, like, climbing the walls without you there. That's what substitutes are for. - Unless you have other plans. - No, no, no, no, this is amazing. What are you thinking, like, a Runyon hike or...? You want to maybe scout some potential wedding locations? I think I have a better idea. Seriously? Hi. What are you still doing here? Uh, I live here. Ella, what's going on? God, Jonah and Rilus interruptus? Do you need something? Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. Yesterday, I took a building-wide poll after the, um... murder... and we all agreed we would feel a lot safer in the courtyard if there was some sort of security camera. So, with Jonah being the building's resident film school grad/A.V. geek, - we figured you could hook us up. - Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess, sure. I have a... - a camera I used for Skype. - Oh, fantastic. Shouldn't a security company be taking care of that? The management company said a service call is more than three weeks away. Jonah could hang something up right now, and we'll just put up a sign saying the building's under surveillance. Uh, we actually have plans. - We're, uh, going to the beach. - Oh. - We are? - How sweet. Well, he's only hanging up a camera. - I mean, how long could it take? - Exactly. Can't it wait until we get back? Riley, if... if everyone's going to feel safe with the camera, I'll just do it now. - It'll take a second. - Wonderful. I'll see you later. What? It's fine. It'll just take a second. Sorry. I borrowed your classifieds. - If you need them... - Oh, no. I was just looking for the sports. What, are you job-hunting? Yeah. There's this ad for models: no experience necessary, $300 a day. Definitely an interview you want to skip. You know, there's a, uh... a hostess that just quit at Coal. If you want, I could put in a good word for you. Really? - You would do that? - Why don't you come down tonight. I'm working. Ask for Marcello. Thanks. Mr. Kirkpatrick. Detective Rodriguez. We spoke yesterday. Oh, right. How you doing? Just wanted to ask you a few more questions. You know, we're talking to all the tenants in the building. Totally routine. Yeah, sure. Whatever I can do. How well did you know Sydney Andrews? Blackmail... is such an ugly word. I prefer... "persuaded." After I persuaded my first husband to marry me, I started drinking. Probably to deal with the fact that he didn't really love me. Thanks. First time? You know, I don't think it counts with the courts if you don't actually come in. How did you know? No one would choose to get sober on Saint Patrick's Day unless they had to. Hey. You're not wearing green. Yeah, well, I wasn't really feeling it this year. So we miss drinking at Molly Malone's tonight. Who cares? There are a lot of other things we could do to have fun. Sydney and... and I-- we were... we were just friends. melrose place s1 e02 www.1000fr.com presents Capture:FRM@´ó±¦ Sync:FRS@ÏºÃ×</font> Ella, this isn't a merger. It's a bloodbath. Only for those being let go. That senior VP from the new firm, Caleb Brewer-- he just got here from New York. He's been here barely an hour, and half of our floor is gone. - Even Phillip. - Oh, thank God. I was getting tired of his snack room melodrama anyway. So, where is this Caleb, sharpening his hatchet? Ella, wait, you can't go up there. Watch and learn. Hi. I'm Ella. Simms? - Junior publicist? - Right. - You work under Phillip. - Worked. From what I hear, he's past tense, and quite frankly, good call. Never trust a man who spray-tans. Or a woman who has no loyalty for her coworker. Here you go. Pack up your office. What? You know... think of this as the Titanic, Ella. There's only so much room on the life raft. Caleb... I never say this to a man, but I am now. Letting me go would be the biggest mistake of your life. Oh, I seriously doubt that. Give me the weekend, and I promise, I will bring a client into this firm that is bigger than Zach Quinto's eyebrows. - Does that even exist? - Two words. Jasper Barnes. So... you think that you're going to sign the hottest star of the summer? Oh, no, no, no. I don't think. I know. BDG is dropping the ball, and he's vulnerable. And of course, I am all over it. I'll tell you what. I'll give you the weekend, but you come back Monday morning empty-handed, and you're out. That's one thing you'll learn about me, Caleb. I never come back empty-handed. Come on. Zuma Beach is calling our name. Oh, I hear Zuma, too, and I'm saying back, "We're going to be there soon." You realize this camera is also a total invasion of privacy. Not if the building asked for it. Ella asked for it. Okay, is that what's bothering you here-- Ella? Kind of. I mean, she walks into our apartment like she owns it. What? And then you drop everything just because she asks you to. Dropping? Nobody's dropping anything. I didn't drop anything. I just... I want everyone to feel safe. Come on, Jonah. This camera isn't about people feeling safe. It's just another excuse for her to come between us. Riles, Ella's not the Wicked Witch of West Hollywood. She's just looking out for everyone's safety. Look, give me five minutes. I'm going to pack up that rocket sled, and then it's "PCH, here we come." Well, I'm totally going to kick your butt in smash-ball. Okay, fine, you're on. Look, I know the market's pretty soft for a pre-Impressionist Plein Air, but Sotheby's has that listed at 1.3. Million. I don't know. I'll see what I can do. I can't give you anything for it until I have a buyer. I don't work on consignment. Since when are you interested in French landscapes? Since my dad started collecting them. I don't get it, man. What's a rich boy like you doing this stuff for anyway? Look, I need cash, okay? - Can you sell it or not? - I'll talk to my guys. But you want quick cash... bring me something I can move. How about a Tour de I'lle watch? Gold casing, diamond-crested dial. Diamonds are Amir's best friend. But come on, the Tour de I'lle? I know that watch. - It's one of a kind. - Yeah, so am I. It's at a house on Nightingale. There's a party there tomorrow night. Stop by for a drink, some food, pick up a nice little timepiece as a party favor. I'll see you back here tomorrow night around closing. What's up? Hi. So, that party tomorrow night? I'm your plus one, okay? Sorry, El. I told you already. It's a plus none. Trudy's keeping it small. I know what you told me, and I'm ignoring it. Jasper Barnes is going to be there, and I need a face-to-face. I don't care. You can't come. Give me one good reason. Uh, Trudy. She's my ex. From high school. Who cares? She does. Oh, David, please, okay? She's a stylist to the stars. She can date anyone she wants. El, listen, El. Okay, I'm telling you. She's still hung up on me. Showing up with you is gonna unleash her inner crazy. Yeah, and I promise you I won't dry-hump you in the doorway. Seriously, tell her we're just friends. Although, I guess that conflicts with what I told that detective the night I was saving your ass. How many times are you going to remind me of that? Call Trudy and score me an invite to that party, or your alibi for the night Sydney died goes bye-bye. Another shot of the good stuff, you'll be feeling a lot better. Hello? Lauren, hey. It's Toby... from last night. Hey, Toby. You-You still in Los Angeles? I'm on my way to the airport. Look, I-I just wanted to call and tell you that I had a great time last night. I know it could have been awkward. Toby, you paid me to have sex with you. Awkward was a given. You're a nice girl, Lauren. And you are going to be a phenomenal doctor. Already are. Listen, I, uh... I just had breakfast with this friend of mine, Rick. - I think he could help you out. - Help me out? I mean, make a donation, you know, kind of like I did. Look, Toby... what happened last night-- that was a one-time thing. - Okay? - Rick is a really cool guy. I wouldn't have called if I didn't think you'd like him. You know, Toby, thank you for being my pimp, but I'll pass. All right. Well, if you change your mind, you have my number. - Hey. - Hey. How was it out there? Oh, decent sets. Look, I'm-I'm sorry. I know we'd talked about going for a run this morning. I didn't mean to flake. It's just... I got up early this morning. I needed to get out. I know how much Sydney meant to you. If you want to talk, I promise I won't do that thing couples do. Anything you say-- it can just be between us. You know, it's funny, 'cause after everything I've been through, I thought I could handle anything. But Sydney... I just can't seem to get her out of my head, Riley. It's like every time I close my eyes... she's looking at me. Talk to me. Sorry. Is Marcello around? He's right there. Excuse me? Marcello? My friend Auggie told me you have a hostess position available. - I wanted to apply. - Dressed like that? Honey, you're not catering a wedding at a Holiday Inn. She could change. You should give her a chance. - I'm a hard worker. - Oh, I'm sure you are. I'm sorry, honey. Wait, let me see. Look, your job is to pick up the drinks and deliver them with a smile, okay? Smile. Marcello, why do you got to be like that? She's a good kid. Look, I'm not hiring some girl just because you want to get in her pants. You're way off base, man. She's just a friend. Yeah? Sydney told me the same thing when she convinced me to hire you. But she wasn't just your fairy godmother, either, was she? - Oh, my God, Auggie. - Leave me alone. - Please. - It's me. Auggie, I can help you. Did you? - Please tell me you didn't. - Not yet. I didn't know who to call, or what to do, but I can't do this. I can't not drink. Yes, you can. You have over 90 days sobriety. Don't throw it away over nothing. It's not nothing. Today's Dineen's birthday. - My girlfriend. - Your girlfriend? We've been sleeping together for three months, and now you tell me you have a girlfriend? She's not my girlfriend anymore. She died. She was killed... 'cause of me. Auggie... what happened? We were at a bar. Back then, I was always at a bar. This guy... was hitting on her. I was drunk and pissed, so I pushed him into a table. We got tossed. And once we were outside, all hell broke loose. I threw a punch. He pulled a knife. Dineen got between us, trying to break it up. It just was so fast. I didn't see what happened. I just saw the blade, and I heard her scream. Oh, my God, Auggie. She bled to death right there on Hollywood Boulevard 'cause of me. You can't blame yourself for a guy who pulled out a knife and used it. It wasn't your fault. I would have just kept my head together. You can't do that. Hey. The best thing you can do to honor her memory is to stay sober. That's what you need to focus on. And that is what I'm gonna help you do. Auggie, hey. You need me to be your rock, and I will be that. But the only way I can do that is if we start taking the program more seriously. And that means no more sleeping together. I love you too much to see you fail. No. I-I understand that my balance is $30,000, but I thought that since I gave you a check for $5,000, I could get an extension. Oh, well, can-can you ask your supervisor? Wait. So, you're telling me that if I don't pay every penny by the end of the semester, you're-you're actually gonna kick me out? Okay. Bye. ?? Thanks so much for helping me out. This clothes thing is so embarrassing. Auggie's 911 call was well-timed. You need help with math, you ask Lauren. You need fashion advice, you come to me. All the girls at Coal-- they all look so perfect. Okay, first thing you need to know is that perfection is as easy as a good pushup bra and some Spanx. I'd let you wear this, but I'm going to wear this tonight. What's tonight, some gala Hollywood premiere? No. I am going to a party in the Hollywood Hills. And I would invite you girls, but the guest list is on serious lockdown. That's okay. I got a date with the couch anyway. I wonder how many hours of reality TV it'll take to help me forget that I'm getting kicked out of med school? What? - Are you serious? - Sadly, yeah. I can't afford the cost of denial anymore. Unless... What about that, you know, $5,000? You mean the scholarship? That's not an option. Yeah, I'm afraid I'm a lost cause. Oh, no, no-- nothing is a lost cause. Not even Violet's sense of style. Here, honey, go try these on. Lauren, you can't give up. Okay, look at me. At work, there are pink slips flying around everywhere. My head is on a chopping block. But you better believe some stupid merger isn't going to stop me from becoming the next Pat Kingsley. You have to become a doctor, Lauren. Ella, I wish it were in my control. Everything is in your control. You have to become a doctor, Lauren. Ella, I wish it were in my control. Everything is in your control. Get another job if you have to. Find any way to make more money. Do anything you can to get that M.D. because I promise you, once you do... you won't care how you got there. You're just going to be really happy that you did. * Tonight's gonna be a good, good night. * what? - What are you doing? - What? Nothing. I did not seriously walk in on you watching porn, did I? No, of course not. Um, no. I'm watching the surveillance video. Oh, my God. Is that Sydney? It looks exactly like her, but it... That's impossible. ??? Hi, I'm Rick. Thanks for coming over. I know what you're thinking, but I swear, I'm not some skeevy dude. No, of course not. Toby said you're a great guy. - Yeah? - Yeah. Toby had a lot to say about you, too. You like Indian food? - Yeah, it's my favorite. - Cool. There's a great, new place over on Cahuenga. We'll have dinner first, then meet some friends for a quick drink. Oh, um... What do you want to say to them about how we met? We'll, uh, tell them... - Well, you're a doctor, right? - I'm trying to be. Well, we met in the emergency room. I just broke my finger last month playing ball. You healed me. Actually, let's skip the part about me being a doctor and just tell them that we met at Trader Joe's? Perfect. So we've been dating, what, a few weeks? A few weeks. Okay. Is it going well? Couldn't be better. Okay, the girl's a little weird. That doesn't make her a murderer. She moves in. A week later Sydney's dead. Coincidence? - What? Stranger things have happened. - Like when? I promise you, there is more to Violet than meets the eye. Auggie thinks she's okay. He's helping her get the job at Coal. Okay, so like, Auggie's the authority on judging people's character? What is this, seventh grade? Are you seriously upset 'cause I'm friends with Auggie? I just think it's an interesting double standard. You think Ella's the one trying to come between us when you and Auggie are, like... - clearly...You know. - Friends? If that's what the kids are calling it these days. I saw the footage, Riley. You sat on the couch with him and had this intense conversation with him for, like... like, 37 minutes and 43 seconds. You're jealous? 'Cause we were talking? "Talking"? No, you were all over him. There was the hand touch and then the shoulder and then, there was this big hug. He lost one of the most important people in his life. I was comforting him. Okay, well, I'm not the only person who thought it was a little odd. Let me guess. Ella? - Yeah, she might've mentioned something. - Do you even get what's happening here? - Ella has a thing for you and you just perpetuate it. - What? You know it. I know it. The whole building knows it. You think she's pushing your career and sending out your movie out of the goodness of her heart? No, because she gets it. She gets what I'm doing. She understands my talent. And you're saying I don't? Wow. I can't even... Wow. I didn't mean to get in a knock-down-drag-out. We're supposed to be celebrating our engagement here, Riley. Call Ella. I'm sure she'd "get it" a lot better than I would. Where's my ahi? I need my ahi and I need it now. Guys, let's go. * Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack * * 'Cause when I leave for the night... * Hey. Who's this? I'm the girl you kicked out of here yesterday. Is the job still available? * ...favorite CDs pullin' up to the parties * * Tryin' to get a little bit tipsy * * Don't stop, make it pop, deejay blow my speakers up * * Tonight I'm-a fight till we see the sunlight * * Tick-tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no... * hey, David. Keep your eyes peeled for a blonde-haired Brit. Most likely nursing a bottle of cognac. - (Watch coming soon) - David! You rat bastard, you made it! Oh, don't tell me this is your new girlfriend? Wow, I'm impressed. You really traded up. - I'm Trudy. - Ella. By the way, I love your house. Yeah, it's my parents' place. They're in Belize for the month, celebrating. My dad just got acquitted. How's your dad? He's good. Great. - I, um, was at his house last night. - Does he still hate me? Ever since his dad found me popping David's meds in high school. I told him, "Hey, we can't all be lucky enough to have ADD," right? So, I saw the, uh, the army of stalkerazzi outside. Who's got them so hot and bothered? - Jasper Barnes. - Oh. He's probably around here somewhere making an ass of himself. Where is that hot Brit? * Tonight I'm-a fight till we see the sunlight * * Tick-tock on the clock But the party don't stop, no * What are you doing here, you hot, little liar? What happened with your date with the couch, missy? Uh, it turned into a date with me. I'm Rick. This is Ella and David. I knew you were dating someone. How long have you two been hanging out? It's, uh, it's a recent thing. Yeah, I told her our fourth date had to be somewhere nicer than the hospital cafeteria. Oh, good. So then you already know that Lauren's all work and no play. The only way you'll be getting any is if you need mouth-to-mouth. - Ella! - Kidding. How do you know Trudy? Oh, just produced Katy's new album. You? - High school. - Oh, she's David's ex. And if she never got over him, then she's one fantastic actress. Who needs a drink? I do. - Pear martini. - Perfect. Jasper Barnes sighting. Duty calls. I'll catch you two lovebirds later. I'm going to go mingle. It's nice to meet you, Rick. - Yeah, you, too. - Don't party too hard, David. I'll try not to. That was a little uncomfortable. You okay? Don't worry about me. ??? Thanks, doll. You read my mind. No, I'm just really good at knowing what people need. Ella Simms. Publicist, WPK. You think I need a publicist? Past few months, I've been on the cover of more magazines than the queen. And that is exactly your problem, my friend. You're overexposed. Don't let Jasper Barnes become the next Josh Hartnett. If you really wanted to make the right impression, you wouldn't be prattling on about overexposure. You'd be unbuttoning my trousers. Yeah, I don't take on small jobs. Cheeky, huh? Okay. Maybe I'll set up a proper meeting with you, talk about my long-term needs. Only if tonight, we focus on my more immediate one. Follow me. Okay, drop 'em. Mmm... nice. You see what's in my hand, you dumb-ass? Bloody hell! You want my two cents as a publicist? I'll give you three. One: put your junk away. Just because it's British does not make it any less offensive. Two: when Andy Dick calls asking you to cohost the Spike TV Awards, the answer, and the only answer, is no. and three: when you're out in public, every single thing you do is one click away from being texted to Perez. I told you you were overexposed. Oh, and by the way... I deleted it. Ta-ta. David? There you are. I've been looking for you. - Hey. - What are you doing in here? You better not be going through the medicine cabinet without me. After what I've just been through, I could use a benzo or 12. All they had were blood thinners, not my thing. You know what? I think you are just being greedy. Or you're lying. I'm not the delinquent you think I am. Let's go. I know you're a guy that Trudy's not the least bit interested in. I am so on to you, dude. You lurk around with this deep, dark brooding secret. You know it's only a matter of time before I find you out. There's nothing to figure out. I am who I am. Yeah, you're so full of it. That's who you are. And it is becoming more and more difficult for me to be friends with somebody who's hiding something from me. If I show you something, you promise to keep it between us? You're not going to flash me, are you? Because I think I've seen enough flappage for tonight. Thank you. No, it's nothing like that. That's where I lived till I was 13. San Bernardino in a trailer park. When my mom was dying, she called the dad I never met. Told him he had to step up. He didn't care. He just felt guilty. So he took me in and threw money at me. I had no idea. Wow. This almost makes me... like you. That was amazing. What, you don't have to run, do you? Actually, I do. I have some rounds pretty early. Oh, come on. Spend the night. I make a mean waffle. Maybe some other time. Oh, so you're going to be up for doing this again? Yeah, definitely. 'Cause I really like you, Lauren. I've, you know, I've... I've hired other girls before, but I've never felt this kind of connection. Maybe... we can try seeing each other... for real. I mean, you seemed like you were having fun tonight. At the party? Where my friends nearly found out I've been selling my body to the highest bidder? I'm just trying to give you what you paid for, Rick. And if that means acting like I like Indian food and pear martinis, fine. I want my money. I want to go home. Hey, Auggie. - Hey. - This is my partner, Detective Drake. You know, I never realized how much tragedy you've been through. Your girlfriend dying like that must've been tough. Did you really think we weren't going to find out that you stabbed a man to death the same night? It was self-defense. Witness testified that the guy was down, but you were in a rage. You stabbed him. Made sure he was dead. - That's not the way the jury saw it. - They just felt sorry for you, August. Playing the whole dead girlfriend card-- smart. Last chance to level with us, Auggie. Did you see Sydney Andrews the night of the murder? Sydney, what are you doing? What do you care? Where's David? He said you were in trouble. In bed. Passed out. Boy needs to learn how to hold his liquor. He's got nothing on you. - I think you've had enough. - Give me that. - No, you're done for the night, Sydney. - You don't get to tell me when I'm done. You don't get to come in here after ignoring my texts all night, - ignoring me for months. - I had to cut the cord, Sydney. You were over the edge. Getting back at David's father was more important than anything: - your sobriety, me! You said you were going to be there for me. - Give it back, Auggie! - You're the one who bailed. - Because it's a joke! This whole thing's a joke. I can't stay sober any more than you can. You don't fool me with that big charade, like you're some poster child for sobriety. You'll crack, Auggie, just like me. Give it to me. - You are one sick woman, Sydney. - And you are a murderer. How does it feel to have your girlfriend's blood ll over your hands? You know what? Give me. I never saw Sydney that night. look ??? You wanted to see me? Well, in case you hadn't noticed, it's Monday. And I am a woman of my word. Have you heard of Trudy Chandler? Stylist to the stars? I am this close to signing one of her clients. Uh, well, "this close" wasn't part of the deal. You know, in fact, I am familiar with Trudy Chandler. So familiar, in fact, that I stopped by her house Saturday night. - You were at that party? - Not only was I there, but, uh, I made quite an impression. I signed Jasper Barnes. Okay, that's impossible because I know what it takes to sign that guy, and there is no way that you could've... Oh, sweetheart, you really need to recalibrate that gaydar. Okay, you may be into men, but Jasper was into me. He is an actor. He's into anybody that can pleasure him personally or professionally. And apparently, you fall into the latter category. - What? - Despite my best "signing" techniques, which were... well, more than enough to seal the deal, he insisted that you be his point person. He said he's never met a publicist as ballsy as you are. Well, He was right. Hey. hey. So on a scale of one to ten, how mad are you at me? Ten's the highest I can go? Look, Riley. I've been thinking about this all night, and you're this amazingly affectionate person, who's... who's always there for her friends. And the fact that I got mad at you for that... That's the reason I fell in love with you. I don't know. I guess... now that we're engaged, maybe we have to dial down our opposite sex friendships. Or considering we're about to spend eternity together, just kind of learn to trust each other. Okay. So it's official then? Neither of us have anything to be jealous of the other person for. except I've always hated that you're Auggie's running partner. Because you said you'd only run if someone's chasing you. Well, then you could chase me. I already got you. * Walking on a dream * * How can I explain? * What's that? Lobster tails. Step up from burgers and dogs. Don't burn them. Hey, Laur, we have plenty of food. Why don't you call up and invite your new boy toy? What boy toy? Well, apparently, Lauren's been dating someone on the DL. Wait, that guy you told me about from the hospital? - You went out with him again? - Sort of. He's... he's not my type. So, Ella, um, what's happening with your job? Sadly, I won't be able to join David in the land of the unemployed day-drinkers. Why? What happened? I signed a huge client without having to whore myself out. Thank you very much. Cheers. Jonah. I want to show you this article I found. It would make an amazing movie. ??? Uh, tonight... You should go. Actually, I'm taking Riley out tonight to celebrate our "engagementhood." Hey, Violet. Coal's newest and hottest hostess. Thanks to Auggie. Um, hello. Why does he get all the credit? I'm the one who queer-eyed you. Why don't you come in? The temperature's perfect. - I love the water. - Yeah, so did Sydney. Did you, uh, did you get a chance to know her before she...? You know? I wish. I'm sorry. There must be some mistake. I know this is totally out of the blue and really weird for you, but it's true. I hired a detective. He tracked you down. He stole your money. Violet, those sleazy private investigators prey on innocent people like you. No, the minute I saw you, I knew it was true. But I wanted to be a hundred percent. So when I was in here signing my lease, I got a strand of your hair from your brush. The DNA test came back positive. You're my mom. Violet, I would love nothing more than to be reunited with some long-lost daughter, but I'm telling you it's impossible. I made this for you when I was nine. I always dreamt of giving it to you. Violet, listen to me. I never had a baby. That's not true. - Why are you lying? - You will find your mom eventually. But to keep pretending that it's me is not going to make you feel any better. - Don't do this to me. - I'm sorry. I was on my way out. This is why I moved here. To know you. Well, then I'm sure you'll want to move out. How about I return the entire month's rent? You don't know what I've been through. I've searched my whole life for you. And now you're here. You're not getting rid
