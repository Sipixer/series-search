WITH EVREYTHING IT'S HAPPYING I'M NOT SO SURE What are you doing with my mom's ring? You could get in, like, so much trouble if my father caught you. Six months ago, I fell behind in my tuition payments. I had sex for money. Do you recognize this valve? It's the one Dr. Mancini invented. You're trying to tell me that the valve is leaching toxins into the bloodstream? It's a Van de Kamp. It's worth $19 mil. So this is why Amanda Woodward slithered back to L.A. If Syd painted over the Van de Kamp with water-soluble paint,</i> she's a lot smarter than I thought.</i> I know you're the embezzler. And it appears that you've stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars. I overheard you talking to Jo- you set me up.</i> ?TÃ— ?TÃ— What a way to wake up. Alarm clocks ar overrated. So wait. Is this how I get to wake up for my 6:00 a.m. call-times every day? Ooh, that early and you are on your own, my friend. Even if you are Mr. Writer/Director of a major motion picture. Oh, gosh, it's a little daunting when you put it that way. What? Are you kidding? You're gonna be amazing. Plus, now you'll have a whole lot more to brag about at your college mixer than snatching uan incredibly h. Yeah, well, I wouldn't have to brag Yeah, well, I wouldn't have to brag if you'd just come with me today. Seriously. Come on. Call in sick and be my date. What?! On the day her highness comes parading back into the office? Not gonna happen comes paShe's got me by back inthe ovaries, Jonah, and she's not letting 'em go. As long as I'm around, she can embezzle all shE wants. Look, big bad Amanda can huff and puff and plant as much evidence as she wants. There's no way she's actually gonna get away with this. Why not? She's done a lot worse. Not to Ella Simms she hasn't. The last place I would want to land is in your crosshairs. And this is Mmm, you're a smart for you. What is it? Two eyes, a nose. It's a total smiley face. It's delicious. Yeah? But maybe you should stay away from food art and stick to playing doctor. All right. Well, if that's the case, back to bed. Doctor's orders. Hmm, well, if I can't find my keys, I mighve to take you up on that offer. Oh, here they are. "Aortic heart valve replacement." No wonder you fall asleep studying. That's, uh, stupid school stuff. So, uh, today's the big day, huh? Jonah's coming to get his Lego sculptures out of your hair. Yep, he's moving into Violet's old place. He says, by the end of the day, my apartment will be officially Jonah-free. I will say I'm gonna miss his killer comic book collection. I'm gonna miss having something on the walls. He owns all of the art in that place. I actually may be able to help you in that department. I found this way back in the closet. I guess top chef left it behind. It's not much, but it's a start. "Sydney Andrews." Wow. I gotta be honest. I wasn't a big fan of her as a person, but I'm kinda loving her art. Yes, Mr. Lao, I can have the painting for you as soon as today. I'll call you the minute I have it in my hands. Tell me something. When you tracked Auggie down, how did you get him to tell you where he left the painting? Did you pay him or did you sleep with him? Who else is gonna tell you all those things you don't want to hear? You're not real. Go away. You can't get rid of me that easily. Just watch me. Careful. You're gonna want to be razor sharp when you break into Dr. Six-Pack's apartment and search his closet. Don't you worry, Sydney. I'm not a perpetual scre w-up like you. I get what I want. I wouldn't be so cocky. How's the water? Would've been a lot more fun if I had someone to splash. So, tonight's your big opening I take it. Coal's never gonna be the same. When the dinner stops, the dancing begins. Doors open at 11:00. You coming? I actually wasn't sure that you'd want me there. Why? I want all my friends there. Oh, um, right. I'm-I'm sorry. I'm just not used to falling into the "friends" column. Lauren, what do you expect? All those times you got paged to go to the hospital, I can't just forget what you were really doing. Look, if I had to go back and do it again, I'd drop out of med school; do anything but what I did. I screwed up. I gotta go. I gotta go. Yeah. I got a ton of stuff to do for tonight. Yeah, yeah. I'll see you there? I'll try. All right. Welcome back, Amanda. We were all wondering where you disappeared to. Is that why you broke into these offices in the middle of the night? Wow. I am flattered that you of all people think I'm that devious. But really, me? A cat burglar? Please. I found a couture button by my computer beside a strand of blond hair. I could tell by the split end it wasn't mine. What do you think you are, some kind of Prada ninja? Do you really just expect me to sit back and let my boss frame me for a crime that I didn't commit? I mean, seriously. All I've ever been is fiercely loyal. All I've ever done is worked my ass off to make you happy. I mean, why am I your crash test dummy? Because you have a proven track recor I mean, whof veering across your crash tmoral lines. The perfect profile for a serial embezzler. My God. How did I ever look up to such a desperate, washed-up bitch? Get out of my building. You're fired. MELROSE PLACE SEASON FINLE - English subtitle By: ISUBS.COIL.US.TO AND ADDIC7ED.COM Oh, hi. Sorry, I thought your e x-roommate might be here. He's out getting boxes. Oh. Okay. Is everything okay? Just peachy. If you can forget the fact that you can now add me to the ranks of L.A. 's hot, young and unemployed. Wow, Ella. I know that job was like your life. That didn't sound right. No, no. You're right. It is. Oh... it was. You know that saying "Everything happens for a reason"? I think I'll just run with that. Well, I'm sorry. Yeah. Where did this come from? Drew found it in his apartment. Wow. Sydney painted it. Mm-hmm. Can I have this? Actually, I kind of like it. Well, it's just that... now that Sydney's gone, I don't... I don't really have anything to remember her by. Ella, you hated each other. We werke sisters. Okay? Sisters fight, thatoesn't mean they don't love each other. Go ahead. Take it. It obviously means a lot more to you. Riley, thank you. Then I guess you owe me one. Yeah. Hands off my mouse, Pragin. There you go. Thank you. So, uh, you going to get off work early? Ditch them scrubs, bust a couple moves? Excuse me? David's club opening's tonight. He flew in a bomb DJ from Miami. Yeah, I'm sure it's going to be vastly entertaining. But I think David would probably prefer it if I steer clear. I take it your courtyard confessional didn't go over so well with him, huh? Don't you have any knoc k-knock jokes to try out on your patients? Lauren, seriously. David's not going to give up on a girl like you. You're one of a kind. All that stuff you did before is just history blowing in the wind. All right? I'd love to stand around and talk about my love life with you all day, but I have to prep a surgery. What'd you get, quadruple? Tell me you didn't get the quadruple. Laparoscopic. Yeah, I'm doing it with Dr. Mancini, actually. We're implanting an M-valve. Whoa, wait. That can't happen. You have to stop it. Drew, look, you have no concrete proof. Okay? I can't just stop a surgery based on a theory. Tell that to Kevin Hartson's family. I mean, how many more people have to die before a theory becomes a fact? Say the patient has a fever. That'll postpone the procedure, buy us time. You want me to falsify the pre-op report? Lauren, a person's life is at stake here. If you had some real evidence... maybe. But I-I can't go along with this. All right? I'm sorry, Drew. I gotta go. Okay, this is definitely yours. Whoa. Gentle. Remember when we lost his nose for like... for like ever? It was just agony to see him suffering so much. Here. There they are. Ooh! Oh, my God, I can't believe you still have it. Oh. What were you, turning 19? I think so, yeah. "Dear Jonah, I've known you "for barely a semester, but I have a feeling "this will only be the first of many birthday cards to come. "To my favorite Darth Vader, "from your favorite sumo wrestler. Love Riley. 2004" You know it took me five blank cards to get those film sprockets just right. Hmm. Uh... I... I stored it in here so it'd safe from all the flying debris. Me and Zac's dorm room was like a 2 4-7 disaster zone. You know, speaking of dorms, what time are you going to the NYU mixer today? I'm not sure. Why? Do you want me to plan it so we're both there at different times? Don't be ridiculous. I mean, we're friends, right? Yeah, we're friends. Of course. Great. Well, then doesn't it seem a little silly for us to take two separate cars? More like environmentally unconscious. Should we carpool? Rocket sled in like an hour? Sounds like a plan. i>-  9:00, Tim Mislowski.</i> Wow! What happened to him? In two years, he turned into a manatee. Will you stop? None of us look like we did when we graduated. You're right. Some of us look better. Hey! Zac. Oh! Hey. Of course the ShoWest screenwriter of the year is here. Hi. How are you? How you been, man? Not as good as you, Orson Welles. Mr. Writer and Director of Living in Reverse.</i> Sick. Thank you. You must be damn proud, Riles. Uh, yeah. Definitely. So what's going on with you? How many billions of dollars has Kensington Squared made already? Yeah.</i> A hundred and three million, seven hundred twenty-two thousand, as of last Sunday. Unbelievable. No way. But who's counting. Yotter not be bragging, Zackie. Hi, Riley! You look so amazing. Hi. So do you. Hey, how are you? You look great. Yeah, doesn't she? Hey. Wait, are you guys back together? I know, after our World War III breakup, a peace treaty seemed unthinkable. But it happened. Oh. And believe it or not, you guys were my inspiration. Us? Yeah. Seeing you guys at the premiere. How happy you were together, how-how you've stuck with each other for, like, a lifetime. Made me realize how crazy I was not to try to make it work with this awesome girl. Oh. Well, I guess, that means I owe you two one hell of a wedding gift. When's the big day? Um... actually... Well... um... We kind of broke up. What? That's impossible. You guys never even fought. Yeah, well, it was mostly my fault... Well, no. No fault. Um... times change, people change, you know. The important thing is that we're really happy right now. So... Yeah. Dr. Mancini, can I talk to you for a second? No, I'm already late for surgery. Uh, I-I know this is coming out of left field, but there's something you need to know. There's-there's a problem with the M-valve. What problem? I created that valve. It has the lowest failure rate of any cardiac appliance. That's what I thought, too. I didn't want to say anything to you until I knew for sure, but it-it appears to be leaching chemicals into the bloodstream. It's causing platelet malfunction, and massive strokes. Those are some pretty serious accusations. Dr. Mancini, the antimicrobial material was a breakthrough, but it was also toxic. 16 people have already died, all M-valve recipients, all stroke victims. I have a toxicology report from a stroke victim, an M-valve recipient who died last week. His platelet count was under 25,000. There are any number of causes for that. Dr. Mancini, 16 people have already died. Do you really want to take that chance? Of course not. I'm going to cancel the surgery. But I want to see your research. Right away. Absolutely. Thank you, Dr. Mancini Hey, David.bsolutely. Table 12 is asking to meet the owner. I told them you're busy, but they insisted. All right, don't worry about it. Okay. There you are. Guess what? I told my dad-- everything. Have a seat, son. Finally, my daughter's dating an adult. Not some bad boy with half his body covered in tattoos. I told you he was mature, Daddy. Clearly not afraid of hard work either. I know how grueling owning a restaurant can be. Oh. It's Cindy. She just got a maltipoo. I'll be right back. Oh, my God, what are you naming her? Well, I should get back to work. David, I just want you to know, nothing makes me happier than seeing my little princess with a smile on her face. Ah, makes sense. And you know what? Nothing pisses me off more than seeing her upset. Now, I ever hear that you hurt my baby girl... swear to God, you're going to wish you never mer. Good steak. Now who's the Prada ninja? Do I look like a cat burglar Well, you certainly don't look like the cable guy. Not that I have to explain myself, but Jane gave me the master key, to check on all the pilot lights. Huh. I see. So you have no interest in the little wall decoration that used to be in here? What kind of wall decoration are you talking about? in theOh, I don't know- -ation thatjust some old painting, of a Dutch guy in a goofy hat. It's probably not worth that much. I was thinking I was gonna sell it on craigslist. What do you want, Ella? Hmm. Oh, no. First, you can start by clearing my name in that silly embezzlement mess. Consider it done. Then... I can art my own publicity shingle, free and clear. Ella Simms and Associates. What do you think? Sounds promising. Good luck with that. nna need a little bit more than luck. I'll need financing-- and that's where you come in. How much do you need? Well, it'll have to be in Beverly Hills, so, probably a number with lots and lots of zeroes. Oh, and I'll be taking my most buz z-worthy clients with me. Fine. Give me the painting, Ella. The painting's all yours... after the paperwork is done. Remember that? Oh, my God. Yeah. We were studying for our Che m-one midterm. Both came down with that deadly mushroom pepperoni craving. Mm-hmm. Whew! Practically flew to Grimaldi's. Didn't you bribe your way to the front of the line? Best five buck. If I remember correctly, we had that pizza for breakfast as well. Tasted even better in the morning. Oh! There they are. Nice. Milla the Killa and Zac Attack. Undefeated beer pong champions, gods among men. Dudeey should erect a statue of us in that rec room. You know, you ever wish you could turn back the clock, just go back to freshman year? All the time. Life was so much less complicated. I mean, besides grades, what was my biggesrry? FigurinG out how to get my roommate to sleep at her boyfriend's so Jonah and I could have a night to ourselves. Ooh. Excuse me. Oh. Robbie! Zac, what's up, man? What are you doing, dude? You know, if I did have a chance to go back, I'd probably do a couple things differently. Really? Like what? I would've appreciated what I had, and not been in Really? Like what?  such a rush to move things forward. Riley! Come see Tracy's baby bump. It's adorable. Oh, okay. What? No shirtless heartthrobs taped inside? I'm shocked. Why are you in such a good mood, Pragin, hmm? WHy shouldn't I be? Confronted Dr. Mancini. And he is postponing all M-valve procedures till more tests are done. What? He didn't put up a fight? What can he say? I gave him my data. He gets it. It's all good. Drew Pragin? That's me. Can you open your locker please? Any particular reason? Just open it. So you want to see if I'm a boxers or a briefs man? All right. But I'm just letting you know, there are some socks in there that are pretty ripe. : I don't know. Oxycodone? Those are not mine. I've never seen 'em before in my life. Dr. Pragin, you'll have to come with us. Hey, look, look, if he says it's not his, it's not his. I'm sorry, ma'am, he has to come with us. Get your hands off me! All right? Mancini did this. You see what type of person he is? Let's go! You have to stop the surgery! Now, we have a full list. Make sure that we don't exceed capacity. Uh-huh. Because... You're not gonna keep me waiting outside the velvet rope, are you? Okay, just make sure. Hey, I'm so glad that you came. Are you kidding me? It's only the opening of my boyfriend's club. I wouldn't miss it for anything. Okay. Shot, please. Mm-hmm. Sit. Morgan. Look, the reason that I brought you here... My dad totally loved you. And he hates everyone. Especially my boyfriends. Look, Morgan, I don't want to hurur feelings. Okay? I-I like you. I do. But this whole talk about me being your boyfriend, it can't be like that. This is about that other girl, isn't it? The doctor who's always on call. I heard of her big confession at that party. This has nothing to do with her. I can't believe I'm going hea d-to-head with a whore. Don't you call her that. She only Did that to get through school. Just like you only robbed my dad's house to buy this restaurant? Look, give me time. I don't mind a little competition. ?TÃ— Papa, I can see... ?TÃ— Biggest shocker of the night, though? Danny Pinkerton announcing his gender reassignment surgery. Not really. You remember my high heels kept disappearing, and you found them in his dorm room? Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. You know, some people would say the biggest surprise of the day was our breakup. It's really weird that our relationship became this big cautionary tale. Mm-hmm. Anyway, I think this bad boy's the last of 'em. Are you sure? Did you check under the bed? I'm pretty sure I saw your nunchakus. I think I got everything. I just cannot find my lucky penny still, so... Well, if I find it, I'll drop it by. Okay. Um, I guess that's... Yeah. I'll, uh, see you around the courtyard. Guess so. Okay. Okay. Wow. Oh, my God, what are we doing? I'm not sure, but... it just... it feels right. Riley, let's go back. You said it yourself the day after we broke up. What if we just go back to that time before we were engaged, that time when we just... we laughed a lot? What about Ella? She's made me realize so much about myself, but... I know she's not the person that I'm meant to be with. I tried to force things to be a certain way, and it's just... relationships aren't like screenplays. You know, you can't just give 'em a title and then make up the plot. Look, I... I want to forget about the past. I want to forget about the future. I just... wAnt... to live in the moment... with you. Jonah, things are different now. I know things are different. But, like, things were different with Zac and Tess, and look what happened to them. You know, they realized how amazing what they had was, and they just... they didn't want to throw that away. What we had was special. It really was... I'll never forget it. But what I want now it's different than what I wanted then. Got it. I'm sorry. Ready, Doctor. Thank you, Nurse. You can place that there. Do you want this draped? How's our CO2 levels? Ah, looking good. Everything's stable. Check the echo, see if we got a good picture. We got a good picture. Have those sutures standing by, okay? I've got them right here. You want the disposable also? Dr. Mancini? This patient had a temperature this morning-- 102. I just Checked his temperature. 98.7. Scalpel. Retractor. Right here. Stop. What? Huh? I don't know what's going on. You've just contaminated the operating room, Yung. Get this patient into OR 7. I know about the M-valve. It's not safe. What does she mean, not safe? Pressure's getting to you, Yung. You've lost your mind. There's reason to believe this valve leaches chemicals that cause platelet malfunction and massive strokes. She's upset I'm taking her off my team. That's not true. I'm trying to save this man's life. ?TÃ— Let's go! Went to the club to do some dancing... ?TÃ— You came. How could I not? Andy. Yeah? This girl pays for nothing. You got it. Uh, no, no. Andy, this girl pays for everything, because tonight, I am feeling particularly flush. Why? Something straighten out at work? Couldn't be straighter. Hmm. Cheers. Cheers. ?TÃ— All the way down ?TÃ— ?TÃ— I like, I like, I like ?TÃ— ?TÃ— I like it like that... ?TÃ— Hey! Congratulations. Hey. This place is raging, man. We're all so proud of you, David. Thanks. Aw. That's so sweet. Hmm. Hi. Hey. So, who's the stud who owns this place, huh? Congrats, man. Thanks. This is wild. Hi. Hey. So, how was your big alumni bash? Did you and Riley make nice in front of alyour college clas? Oh... Ah, let's... I can't hear a thing. Let's go over here. Oh. Okay. I just... I got to tell you something. Oh. Okay. I can't pretend like this didn't happened. Um... today, after the party, Riley and I came home, and... and I kissed her. What? I'm sorry. I didn't plan it. I didn't... I wasn't thinking about it. It just... it just kind of came out of nowhere. Yeah. Like a tsunami. So, what? You and Riley are moving back in the same day you're moving out? No. We're not... Riley and I-- we're never getting back together. It just... This put a lot of things into perspective. Yeah, it sure does. Jonah, I told you up front that I wasn't going to be your rebound. You weren't. You're not. Ella, I really care about you a lot. Okay, no, Jonah, just-just stop, okay? You come off as this-this sweet, sensitive, honest guy, the type of guy that woulD never break a girl's heart in a million years. Ella, look, I never, ever meant to hurt you. I swear. Oh, you know what? Thank you. Seriously. Because of you, I've realized that maybe monogamy isn't the end of life as we know it. Maybe I... maybe I can be in a real relationship. Just not with you. Ella. ?TÃ— I like it like that... ?TÃ— Thank you, Mr. Lao. Like a dog looking for a bone, you don't quit till you get what you want. I am so impressed. Oh. I bet. You never had much perseverance, except, of course, in the case of the opposite sex. You know, all that money-- it's not going to bring you a shred of happiness, especially if you have no one to share it with it's notYeah, well, ring you I'm not big on sharing. I'm perfectly happy on my own. I told myself the same thing. Look where I ended up. I just heard from the hospital. What? You won't fake a fever, but you pull the ultimate eleventh hour save. Yeah, well... I didn't know you had it in you. Oh, yeah. Neither did I. Put me down. I hate to say it, but I trust you. So I'm not a total idiot after al Now, let's notit, get carried away. Hmm. Hmm. Hey, I didn't know that you were going to come. Wouldn't miss it. Well, look at you. Come a long way since breaking and entering was your bread and butter. Huh? Mm-hmm. David! Where have you been? I've been looking for you. Hi. I'm Morgan. David's girlfriend. Ex-Excuse me? What? You're...? Lauren, that's not really how it is. That's not what you said when we were making love. That's enough! Lauren, wait. Lauren! Lauren, wait. Shouldn't have expected you to put your dating life on hold. Okay, I'm not dating anyone, and that girl is not my girlfriend. All right, it's a long story. Yeah, I'm-I'm sure it is, David, but, look, you don't need to lie to me, all right? I-I get it. You've moved on. I'm not lying to you. I've known that girl maybe three weeks. That's it. And she's been practically stalking me since I first met her. It... Wh...? Stalking you? Since I broke into her parents' mansion. Look, it was my swan song. A one-time deal so I would never, ever have to do it again. And I only slept with that girl because she threatened to tell her dad. It was a mistake. A mistake. Right. I'm no better than you are, Lor. I'm a hypocrite. Here I am holding you to some high standard, and I'm worse. Sounds like we're both far from perfect. Maybe we're perfect for each other. I love you, Lauren. Mr. Miller? Huh? Yeah. That's me. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Ari, the PA. Okay. We're right here on stage four. Screen test's running right on time. I got you a coffee, fresh fruit. If you need anything, you come to me. All right, Mr. Miller. Look, all I need from you is for you to call me Jonah. All right? Right. Jonah. Oh, my God. Owen's in hair and makeup, and Mira aka Rachel's right over there. Oh. Hey. Good morning. Yeah, it sure is. I got to go down to Coal. But tonight, what do you say I take you somewhere specia and celebrate... us? I'd love that. You pick. Anywhere you want. Surprise me. So, I take it Jonah owns most of the mugs, huh? It's fine. I have drank Coffee out of glass before. It's not a big deal. Did I make it too sweet? Felt like I made it too sweet. Um, no. Look, Drew, I need to be honest with you. Uh-oh. No good news ever starts this way. Yesterday, at the alumni mixer, Jonah and I kind of got caught up in the nostalgia, and, well... we kissed. He kissed you? We kind of kissed each other. But it didn't go anywhere, and it's not going anywhere. If anything, that kiss made me realize now more than ever that I'm ready to move on... with you more than ever that I'm o move on... Now that, uh, we're being brutally honest with each other, I want to give you a chance to get out of this before it gets any more serious. No. Drew, I don't want to get out of anything. Me and Jonah-- it's over. I'm just not a person to get attached to. Why would you say that? Drew, what's going on? I don't like telling people this, because I hate being treated like I'm sick. And I've been fine becauthanks to a surgeryated I had five years ago. Surgery? I was born with a congenital heart defect. They did laparoscopic surgery. The great news is, no scarring. The not so great news is... they gave me a new valve. Mancini's valve. What are you saying? I don't know how long I have to live. Good morning. Look, I don't know what your daughter told you, but I'm not her boyfriend. You're right. 'Cause I don't let my daughter date thieves. But she told me she saw you stealing the ring, and that you seduced her into keeping her mouth shut. Okay, that's not what happened. No? Do you know who I am? Huh? I'm somebody you don't want to steal from. All right, sir, I'm sorry. I'll pay you back. All right, it'll take me some time, but I can pay you back. I got a better idea. You got past my security system, which takes a certain degree of skill and some serious balls, so, from now on, kid, you're gonna be working for me. No. I'm through with that life. I'll pay you back, but I'm not a criminal anymore. Really? Well, you might want to rethink that, because... I'd hate to see anything happen to such a pretty doctor. You stay the hell away from her. You're not going to touch her. Your first job's tonight. I'm gonna call you with the details. Amanda, hello. I just came by to pick up the check. Oh, for that silly company of yours? I changed my mind. Did you forget a little thing called a contract that we signed yesterday? Well, I'm afraid you never read the fine print. It's null and void at my discretion. Oh, don't worry. I'm sure another firm will gobble you up... if they're in the market for embezzlers. Actually, I did read the fine print. You know, it was so hard to understand that I thought maybe a few photos of you and your new art collector friend might help me out. I'll download them for you right now. They're on my server, which, well, normally would be a problem, but this is, like, the fastest 3G you can get. Oh. And look, there you are, caught red-handed. You know, you should have paid that PI what you promised him. He was more than happy to do me a favor. Even you wouldn't do something this stupid. I already did. P and K are putting me in charge of the L.A. offices until they get back here from New York. Well, you can tell my partners that I am the majority shareholder. Oh, you can tell them yourself when they're visiting you in jail. FBI. Amanda Woodward you're under arrest for the possession, transportation and sale of stolen art. Oh. You say you modeled your career after me, studied my every move. Then you know this war is just the beginning. Let's go, ma'am. Melrose Place SEASON FINLE!
