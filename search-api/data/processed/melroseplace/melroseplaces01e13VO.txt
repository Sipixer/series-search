You are a hugely talented filmmaker. I love you, I do, but too much has happened since we got engaged. I should be with someone who believes in me. I know you weren't meant to be with him. Tell me you don't feel the same way. You need to leave. All my life, all I wanted was to be a doctor. I'm a little concerned about your finances. - I can work it out. - Geez, you've really gone pro. Professional's always best for the job, right? I've never dated anyone like you. Someone have a little too much to drink? You slipped me something, didn't you? Get her into seven! - What's wrong? - It looks like an overdose. Amanda does not come all the way across the country just to slap us on the wrist. She's the president. Jane said I can stay in the penthouse, and I can't wait to become a part of each and every one of your lives. Morning. Last night... that really happened, huh? Yeah. Twice. - Oh, my God. - Yeah, that's what I said. Oh, my gosh. Yesterday couldn't have been any more surreal. Within 24 hours, Curtis Heller bought Living in Reverse. Get ready to join some guilds, Mr. Miller. Next thing I know is that I'm this hotel suite, - with you where we... - Worked up quite an appetite. So, the suite's comped by the studio. All I have to do is call down and say that Curtiss... young protege deserves to have one of everything. Banana French toast. Followed by a $20 omelet. I can't. I'm sorry, did I just hear Jonah Miller... turn down an all-you-can-eat breakfast? I'd love to spend the whole morning here. Last night was great. You are great. But Riley called me, like, a dozen times. So I should at least let her know... I'm not dead on the side of the road somewhere. Oh, yeah, you... you should definitely... let her know that you're okay and... Look, I know the dust hasn't quite settled yet, but... you might as well be honest with Riley about how you really spent the night. You're not gonna lie to her, are you? I just don't think she... necessarily needs to hear all the gory details. Riley told you the truth last night. Don't you owe her the same? Yes. I-I just... - It's just... it's complicated. - Is it? Really? She has no idea what she wants. But I, on the other hand I know exactly what I want. All set for today. I need you to find it. Your adoring boyfriend says no BlackBerrys in bed. House rules. You know I don't like rules. You realize you're the only man who could pry a PDA from my grip... and keep me laughing at the same time. I do my best. I was so worried the morning bubbly... might fall by the wayside once we lived in the same city. Speaking of which, I think I saw something under the bed. My gosh. Zanottis. My gosh, these aren't even in the stores yet. They are in Milan. It's a perfect fit! I'll wear them to my party tonight. Well, I have a special surprise... for you tonight. It'll show you and everyone else how much I love you. A surprise. Don't torture me. I demand a hint. It's beautiful, rare... and goes perfectly with your sparkling eyes. You know me. I like things to move fast. You brought flowers? Is this part of your training, finding out what it's like to almost die? If it is, I think I flunked. I found you on a hotel room floor. You were passed out. Your lips were blue. You want to tell me what happened? Some of the interns went for a drink after our shift. I was really tired. I-I had a martini, and it made mel light-headed. So, someone had a-a room, and I-I went upstairs, and I guess I fainted. Why are you lying? Lauren, I know that you OD'd. Promise no to get mad at me. You can tell me anything. I went to meet a guy. A guy I used to date. He called me yesterday morning to ask me out, and I said yes. To tell him I couldn't see him again. I thought he was taking it okay, but I-I don't know, he must have slipped something in my drink. Next thing I knew, we were in that room. And then? What did he do? Nothing. Nothing. I was having a bad reaction to the drugs, he got scared, and he left me there. Who the hell is this guy? He's just a jerk. Just a jerk. We have you scheduled for an EEG. Listen, this is kind of embarrassing, and I don't want anyone else to know, so can you please just let it go? It's let go. You're gonna be okay. Dark_Chii, Just-In, Psiko, peluche, WoLF71 pr√©sentent... If you break that, you're all gonna chip in and pay for it. - It says "Handle with care." - Oh, crap. Don't worry about that- it's just a priceless antique. I saw that. We need to talk about my party. That is, if you can find the energy - fresh off a one-night stand. - It wasn't a one-night stand. You keep telling yourself that. Anyway, we need to hire a new caterer. I thought we hired the caterers... from Gwen Stefani's birthday party. And then I fired them. Told the party planner I don't care if it's trendy, you don't put cotton candy on foie gras. I know someone who will be perfect. Don't worry, your reintroduction to the A-list will be flawless. Today happens to be more than impressing and intimidating L.A.'s power elite. Now, Ben mentioned that he's planning something special. Let's just say he's a "grand gesture" kind of guy. I want make sure nothing goes wrong. Is it possible that he is gonna slip something sparkly on that finger of yours? I'm your boss. My personal life is none of your business. Right. I trust that everyone in the building is coming today? Well, my fellow courtyard dwellers are more of "who's that" than "who's who." Inviting them was the neighborly thing to do. I want them all there. Make it happen. Amanda's party tonight! Be there or I will hurt you. Oh, my God. Jonah, thank God you're home. Yeah, I started organizing your comic books... to keep me from freaking out all night. I'm sorry. I should've called. - We need to talk. - You have the right to be furious. Last night... You just have to understand how incredibly hard that was for me. No, I know. What I said, what I did... Jonah, I am so sorry. I'm not proud of the way I acted, either. How were you supposed to act? Look, I am lost. I am confused. But the one thing I do know is that the last five years with you have been the best years of my life. Before we decided to get married, we never fought. We never had any issues. We just... laughed a lot. Can't we just go back to the way it was? Without the engaged part? You're asking me to commit to a future... with someone who won't commit to anything. I'm not asking you to commit. I am asking you to live in the moment with me. What we have together, it is too special to just throw away. We owe it to ourselves to try to make it. It's just... After everything that's happened... I'm not so sure... So, since you'whiz kid, I thought, "Who better to cook for Amanda's party than Coal's best ex-sous-chef?" That's pretty high praise and pretty short notice. You will have a fully loaded kitchen... an army of servers, and... I sort of already told them you'd do it. Then it's a good thing I kept every recipe Marcello ever shot down. Thank you. You have no idea how much I need this gig today. Oh, please. It's the least I can do. Especially after believing you were a knif e-wielding lady killer gone AWOL. You weren't the only one. - Don't worry about it. - Good. Okay, the party's at her boyfriend's estate. I will text you the detail... Auggie, sweetheart. Please tell me you did not hit this. I was trying out a new recipe. Rock shrimp with a tequila lime sauce. Really? Does that dish come with a side of total BS? I'm fine. Sometimes I need to use alcohol in the kitchen. No. What you need is to be on your game tonight. Look, just promise me that you won't mess this up. You know how much this means to me, okay? I'm sober. I swear. Don't test me. Half my clients are in rehab. And do not be late. Man, what's up? I'm just on my way out. A quick, random question for you. Is there any chance I could maybe - crash on your couch tonight? - You want to stay here? - Why? - Just looking for a quiet place, somewhere I can start working. Just on my script and collect my thoughts. My head's, like, totally spinning right now. Riley and I called off the wedding last night. Yeah, man. Come in. Uh, sit down. - Thanks. - What happened? We had this come-to-Jesus moment on our way to elope. And basically, she admitted she didn't want to get married. Which pretty much felt like a rusty dagger through my heart. So, I ended it, and... then I did something big. Like, a thing... I would normally not do. What did you do? After the fight, one thing kind of lead to another, and... Ella and I sort of hooked up. That didn't take long for Ella to pounce, did it? Ella didn't pounce. It was actually me who did the pouncing. So, this morning, I came home and I was totally ready to do the right thing and tell Riley, but she just was so sad and apologetic... I just... I couldn't get it out. Good. This stays between you, me, Ella and the wall. All right? You can stay here as long as you want. You and Riley are going to figure things out. Ella's one night, man. Riley's forever. I know, I thought about that, too, but forever with Riley is just a lifetime of playing it by ear. Ella knows what she wants. That's... I got to say, refreshing. Whatever. Either way, listen. Do not tell Riley. Think about it. It'll devastate her. So, what? I'm supposed to carry this massive secret around... - for the rest of my life? - Exactly. Hey. Jonah, It's Ella. I Never Heard Back From You About The Party Tonight... And, Well, I Was Wondering If I Was Going To See You. I Know How Much You Love An Open Bar. So, Call Me Back. Okay. Bye. First The Fig, Then The Duck, Dab Of Creme Fraiche, Garnish With The Crispy Sage. You Got It? Oh, My God. We Have Got To Get You On Top Chef. Then You Can Introduce Me To Padma. You Good? I Don't Need To Get You To Say The Alphabet Backwards? Go On Finish It Off. There's More Where That Came From. The Tap. I'm Sorry To Get All Dr. Drew On You, It's Just After Seeing Caleb... Get Summarily Canned Right In Front Of Me, I'm Still A Little Shell-shocked. Don't Worry. Tonight Will Be Perfect. Good, Because I Think I Spotted A Guillotine In Amanda's Penthouse. Watching Heads Roll Is Probably Up There With Snuffing Out Careers And Tasering Her Enemies' Nether Regions. I Heard She Bathes In The Blood Of Virgins And Can Kill A Man With Her Pinky Finger. - Hi.

This Would Go Great With The Wild Mushroom Ragout. - Yeah, It Would. - There You Are. I See You've Met My Boyfriend. Not Formally. Funny, Ella Was Just Talking About You. Oh, Behind My Back? I Want Details. Oh, She Was Just Mentioning... the Countless Ways You Motivate And Inspire Her. Very True. I Saw Auggie Kiss You Last Night. That Was Kind Of A Shock For Me, Too. You're Not Into Him? Last Night, All I Needed Was A Friend, And He Ended Up Making A Pass At Me. After Jonah And I Broke Up. Oh, God, Riley. I'm Sorry. I Had No Idea. And I'm Sorry About What You Went Through Last Night. That Must Have Been So Scary. It Was, But I'm Okay. You Know What Will Make Us Both Feel Better, Is Getting Out Of This Apartment Building. Did You Get Ella's Text? We Could Go To That Party. Come On, What Else Are You Going To Do? It'll Be Fun. I Promise. The Floral Arrangements Have Lilies In Them, Which Is My Least Favorite Flower. I'll Tell The Party Planner. Give Me Five Minutes And There Will Not Be A Lily In Sight. No Excuses, Just Quick Thinking. That's A Very Valuable Asset In Our Line Of Work. Amanda, This Is Your Night, And I Will Do Whatever It Takes To Help Make It Perfect. Your Focus And Your Ambition. You Remind Me A Lot Of Myself. I Don't Know What To Say. I Mean, You're... You're My Idol. You Have It All... A Thriving Career, An Amazing Man In Your Life. Well, Sometimes Things Have A Way Of Falling Into Place.

Well, Uh, I'm Gonna Go Get Some Food. Of Course You Are. So, Riley. Last Time I Saw You, You Were In A Pretty Tense Standoff With Jonah At The Gas Station. Is Everything Okay? Actually, Jonah And I Had A Very Honest Conversation This Morning. Jonah. You're Here? It's Better To Know Where Things Stand, Isn't It? What's That Supposed To Mean? Riley Was Just Telling Me That You Guys Had Quite The Chat This Morning. Yes, True Story. That's What We Do, Ella. We Talk. We Communicate. And What Exactly Did You Communicate About? Well, Things Are Kind Of... Jonah, Can I Talk To You For A Second? Yeah, About That Computer Thing? No, About Something Else. So I Take It You Decided To Recant Your Confession? Ella, Come On. It's Not That Easy, Okay? Really? Because It Was Pretty Easy For You Last Night... To Tell Me That It Wn't A One-night Stand. Last Night Would Have Never Happened If I Knew You Were Gonna Play It This Way. I'm Not Playing Anything. I'm Just Trying To Figure Out The Right Way To Do This. Really? 'cause It Seems To Me Like, In The Cold Light Of Day, You Don't Know What You Want. Kinda Like Somebody Else We Know. Maybe You Two Are Perfect For Each Other. What Did Ella Want? She Looks Pretty Ticked Off. You Know Ella, Right? Told Her I Wasn't In The Schmoozing Mood, And She Just... I Don't Know Why I Let David Talk Me Into Meeting Him Here.

Knife's So Sharp, Didn't Even Feel It. Total Waste Of Good Truffles. My God, You've Been Drinking. I Had A Little Wine. So What? I'm Fine. You Are So Not Fine. Violet, I'm... Let's Go. Let's Go. As Long As You're Around Riley, As Long As You're Living In The Same Building, You're Gonna Drink. And One Day It's Gonna Kill You. Violet, Look, I Appreciate You Being Concerned About Me, But You Have No Idea What You're Talking About. Yes, I Do. I Know What It Feels Like To Be Obsessed. Staying In That Building After My Mom Died... Was The Worst Mistake I've Ever Made. You Can't Blame Your Problems On Where We Live. It Doesn't Help To Walk Past The Spot Where My Mom was Murdered. And It Doesn't Help You Seeing Riley Across The Courtyard. Let's Leave... The Both Of Us. - Let's Get Out Of This City. - Violet, I-i Can't Just Leave. - My Whole Life Is Here. - What Life?

So, He Asked Me To Try It On Because He Needed To Know If It Was Too Much. That Was It, Okay? I Promise You That You Can Trust Me. Ella, In What Universe Would You Think... For One Moment That I Was Threatened By You? - I Wasn't Implying That You... - You Were, And It's Presumptuous. I Mean, You're A Junior Publicist With A Barely There Career... A Nobody In This Town. I Know. I-i'm Sorry. You May Fancy Yourself My Protege, But Let's Be Honest, You Don't Measure Up. You Have Enough Flash To Catch The Eye Of Ben... Or Any Other Man For That Matter... But They Don't Stay Long, Do They? - I... I Wasn't Trying To... - Oh, Come On. No One Wears A Dress That Short Without An Endgame. Is Everything Okay Over Here? Yeah, Of Course. Ella, Would You See... If The Party Planner Needs Any Help? I Was Just Playing With Ella Back There. You Know You're The Only Woman I Want. Yes, I Know That. And I Know You Hated The Bentley. It Was A Swing And A Miss, And I'm Sorry. And Does This Make It Any Better? It's Gorgeous. I Mean, But Honestly, What You Were Saying This Morning, I... Oh, Of Course. What A Bonehead I Am. All The Hinting. You Thought I Was Going To Propose. Thank God You Didn't. I Mean, It Would've Been A Sweet Gesture, But We're Not Ready To Take That Step, And We're Both At The Top Of Our Games. Why Would I Want Anything More? Amanda, Sometimes It's Hard To Know Exactly What You Want. And Why Should You Know? It's More Fun This Way. Fasten This, Will You? They Let You Out? I Let Myself Out. I Feel Fine. How About You? How Are You Feeling? Fine, I Guess. I'll Tell You Who's Not Feeling So Fine Is, Is Record Producer Named Rick. So Fine Yeah, I'll Bet. That Guy, He's A... He's Quite A Piece Of Work. He's A Liar, Obviously. And A Druggie, As It Turns Out. I Bet He Had Some Nice Stoes To Tell About Me, Huh? My Fist Shut Him Up Pretty Fast. No One Should Ever Get Away With Treating You Like That. I Know. It's Just That No One's Ever Stood Up For Me Before. - I Always Handle Things On My Own. - You're Not On Your Own Anymore. You're With Me. I Am. I'm With You, David. Where Are You Taking Me? Do You Remember What Else Happened At The Chancellor's Party? In His Library? I Think I Still Have Scars From Those Rug Burns. What Do You Say We Reenact History? Wait. What? Like, Right Here? Yeah, It's The Perfect Way To Reboot Our Relationship. Okay, I Just Don't Think... This Is Such A Good Idea. Just Relax. Look, I Love A Trip Down Memory Lane Just As Much As You Do, But We... Riley. Wait, 'cause I... We Need To Talk Aboumething. Like, Really Talk. What Is It? Last Night, After We, You Know, Called It All Off, I Was Just... I Was Completely Rocked. Like, I Thought It Was Really Over. What Do You Think Now? If There's Any Chance We Can Go Back To The Way It Was, Like, Any Chance At All, There's Something You Need To Know. I Slept With Ella Last Night. What? I'm Sorry. You're Sorry? I... I Don't Even Know Who You Are. The Painting I'm Looking For Isn't Here. Are You Sure You Searched Every Apartment In The Complex? Searched And Shot Film In All But One. Couldn't Get Into David Appartment, Because He Was Home And Awake. Well, I Was Hoping To Do This From A Distance, But I Guess I'm Going To Have To Get Closer To Them... Than I Had Originally Thought. Riley Bolted Out Of That Party So Fast... That Jasper Barnes... Almost Fell Into The Pool. I'm Guessing You Told Her. Good Guess. You Didn't Think About Finding Me... And Filling Me In? Did You Really Want To Hear How Hurt She Was? How The Look On Her Face Made Me... Feel Like Just A Total Failure As A Human Being? Why Don't We Go Back To My Apartment And We Can Talk? The Last 24 Hours Have Just Been... Pretty Overwhelming. I Just Need Some Time To Think. Okay, You Go... Think, Socrates. I'll Just Be Over Here On My Side Of The Courtyard. Are You Okay? I'm So Much More Than Okay. I'll Be Right Back. Are You All Right? - I Told Her. - Oh, Man. Oh. Oh, I'm Sorry. Um... I'll Call My Buddy Travis. He's Got A, Like, An Air Mattress. Whatever Happened, You're Staying Here. Your Friend Needs You. Dude, You're Going To Be Okay. You're Going To Be All Right, Man. "I Know I Should've Said Good-bye In Person,</i> but I Always Want To Remember You Smiling."</i>
