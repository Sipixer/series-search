Curtis Heller wants to buy your movie! Wha...? It's not like our engagement expires at midnight; if it doesn't happen today, - it'll happen another time. - Or... not ever? Would that be better for you? Wait. I don't want to be just A one-night stand. You're not. There's something you need to know. I slept with Ella last night. That painting was worth $19 million. And I'll do whatever it takes to get it back. I see you've met my boyfriend. Not formally. Ben Brinkley. DAVID: That's where I lived till  was 13. My mom was dying. She called the dad I never met, told him he had to step up. LAUREN: If you think you need to go out and take what's not yours,</i> there's obviously something missing in your life.</i> You should know that that little hobby of mine, it's over. Lauren? You owe me one last job. MICHAEL: I want you to break avid's heart.</i> Whatever you have with him, end it. Or I tell the entire medical community that I got a house call from Dr. Lauren Yung. ("Alejandro" playing) â™ª She's got both hands... â™ª - Honey, I'm home. - Jonah! Lauren let me in. I, uh, I just thought it was about time you tasted what is known throughout the entire culinary world as "pasta alla Jonah." (chuckles) How sweet. And... domestic. - Is that a bad thing? - It's a yummy thing. Looks like I'll be embracing my inner carb tonight. â™ª Don't call my name â™ª â™ª Don't call my name... â™ª (crowd cheering) Go, Drew! You can get him, Drew! Take him! ALL (chanting): Drew! Drew! Drew! Drew! - All right! Drew. - Yeah! What are you doing? Ma'am, I understand the natural attraction to race car drivers, but you have to stay behind the barriers. Spectator safety's priority number one. What about patient safety? â™ª Ale-Alejandro â™ª â™ª Ale-Alejandro... â™ª I take it you're not going to stick around for the gurney demolition derby. RILEY: Seriously, she was a congresswoman?</i> Yeah. Oh, kill me now. All that stuff I said about how ineffective congress is toward education? Why didn't you shove a roll in my mouth? Because they were rosemary, my favorite, and because the woman was hanging on your every word, Riley. â™ª Just let me go... â™ª MAN (over P.A.): Dr. Yung, report to Triage Three. - Dr. Yung... - Okay. What have we got? Hey, Doctor, we have two chili cheeseburgers, two fries, one animal style. (chuckles) It's called dinner. You probably just don't recognize it 'cause it didn't drop out of a vending machine. (chuckles) You know, as much as I love the idea of eating something that doesn't say, "Just add water," can you call me next time instead of paging me? But then, how would I hear my girlfriend's name over the P.A.? Kind of a turn-on. â™ª Alejandro â™ª â™ª Alejandro, Alejandro â™ª â™ª Alejandro. â™ª Jonah, I don't know. Your pasta is going to have a hard time beating that. (moans) (chuckles) I'm a man of many talents. (moans) Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. Uh, Charlie Kitsis invited me to his kid's second birthday tomorrow. Oh. Congratulations, Jonah. You are officially in on the inner circle, even if it ia gigantic bouncy. Anyway, we should probably leave around, like, 4:00. Yeah. The Evite said "plus one." Jonah, I kind of doubt that you need a publicist to schmooze at a rugrat's birthday. You wouldn't be going as my publicist. It would be like a date. How romantic. You cook me dinner, you ask me out. You're not gonna ask me to prom, are you? You know, David, as much as I appreciate the hand-delivered burger fix, I got to get back to work. Next time, I'll bring you something more gourmet. Coal is for sale. I'm going to make an offer on it. Your boyfriend's going legit. That's great. Could you be a little bit less enthusiastic? - Lor, what's going on? - I'm sorry. It's just... Look, I th... (pager buzzes, Lauren sighs) Got to go. I'm sorry. - No. (sighs) To the first fundraiser that hasn't made me pass out and do a face plant in my chicken piccata. To you. For the whirlwind trip to DC, for tonight, for listening and caring. Thank you. I had an instinct about you. You're an amazing woman, Riley Richmond. Well, I... just totally believe in this project. I do, too. Sync And Correct By YesCool [iSubs.coil.us.to] & [addic7ed.com] I'm sorry. That was... No, it's... ...really forward of me; I just thought I was getting signals. Maybe you were. I don't know. I just know that it's wrong. I'm sorry. No. Don't apologize. No, I mean, you're my boss. Well, actually... And you're with Amanda, who introduced me to you. Look, let's not allow a silly misunderstanding to undermine an incredible project, all right? Deal? Deal. It's time to renew your Road and Track subscription.</i> Uh, apparently, our mailman's Lasik surgery, it didn't work out too well. He thinks I'm David Breck. Oh. Oh, thanks. Wow! All of this great art. - Are you a collector? - Uh, nost like things that are pleasing to the eye, but... I just love some of these pieces. Anyway, I'm just about to crash, so... - Well, who's "S.A."? - Oh, that's Sydney. - Andrews. - Sydney painted? Yeah. She picked it up a few months before she... It's hard to imagine Sydney as an artist. I just can't picture her concentrating on anything for an extended length of time. Yeah, well, you'd be surprised. Anyway, I'm kind of beat and, um... Of course. Get some sleep. Great. (water splashing) Oh, you sucked... Blow... Reach up! That's how you do it, gentlemen. Watch and wait. Don't get too cocky, rookie. You've yet to see my deadly left-handed reverse. Hey, settle down, Miller. You're just pissed 'cause you lost your bikini top that last play. Speaking of bikini tops, is it just me, or is, like, every girl in this complex, like, freakishly hot? Haven't noticed. Yeah, what girls? I don't know. - Like, Riley, for example. - Riley? I mean, uh... I don't want to step on anybody's toes or anything, Jonah, but are you guys, like, over - or, like, over-over? - Let's just say there's no puttinmpty back together again. - I get it. You moved on. Ella seems awesome. Yeah, she is. We're actually going to this kid's birthday party later on today. It's going to be our first official thing as a couple. Yeah, just goes to show you. Ella and Jonah. Anything's possible. You should know, snagging a girl like Lauren. - How'd you pull that off? - What do you mean, how? Oh, my God. The ladies practically line up for David Breck. No, Drew's right. Lauren's got standards. I mean, why shouldn't she? You know, now that we're stepping things up, I got to show her I'm not just some slacker who just... Plays hoops all day? Yeah, something like that. Hey, you know what? Lauren's been a little stressed lately. Has anything unusual been going on at the hospital? Um, aside from demanding professors, dying patients - and eternal lack of sleep? - Sky hoop. Nope. No added stress at all. - Oh, my God, Sydney. - Where? - Oh! (knocking at door) Come in. Oh, just in time. Would you latch this? Well, you're looking chipper. Believe me, the last place I want to be is at a third-rate film festival in Santa Barbara. Now, third rate or not, it is Santa Barbara, not Boise. I mean, you look a little too casual. You did bring a change of clothes, right? Actually, I can't make it. You're breaking up with me. Amanda... I can't wait to hear this. At the end of the day, we want different things. Oh, Is that so? You're this beautiful, sophisticated woman who oozes power, and I'm basically an overgrown geek who doesn't want to grow up, let alone get married. - Who wants to get married? - I told you I wasn't interested in that. When is long-distance, it was fine, but now we... we live in the same city, we see each other all the time, and it's become so... adult. - I'm sorry. - Oh, don't apologize. I mean, in the end, you were nothing more to me than a toy. - A toy? - That's a new one. They're fun for a while, but it's only a matter of time before they start to bore you. I really do care about you very much. And I never meant to hurt you. Oh, you give yourself way too much credit. Good-bye, Ben. Mason. David Breck. We talked on the phone. - Yes. Mr. Breck. How you doing? - Good. Excited. So, you really want to buy this place? Absolutely. It's been a dream of mine - for a long time. - Well, dreams are great. Let's talk about reality. All right. - What's your offer? - Well, we both know the restaurant business hasn't been booming. So I can do $1.5 million cash. $1.5? Mm-hmm. The guy who owns Gidot, offered $2.2. The deal closetomorrow afternoo. That's a lot of money. Yeah. This place is worth every penny of it. You beat that offer by tomorrow, it's all yours. Thanks. Can't go wrong with a stuffed hippo, right? (chuckles) Kids love hippos. Hippos are fabulous. Okay. - Now do the... - Yeah, that. (uneasy laugh) Harder than it looks, right? I'm sorry. I'm just a little out of practice on the whole holding-of-the-hands thing. I just thought you would want to... - This is what I want. - Jonah, are you sure that Sammy is a... The Evite said birthday. It did not specify human or canine. ELLA: Well, if I knew there was going to be drool everywhere, I wouldn't have worn my Balenciaga. Look who's here. Sammy, it's my hottest new client. - How are you, Charlie? - Good to see you. - Hi. Charlie Kitsis. - Hi. Ella Simms. WPK. And you must be Sammy! Oh, happy birthday, Sammy. You do not look a day over one. - Has he had work done? - Funny. You're with WPK? Our boy wonder hired himself a publicist already. I haven't hired a publicist. No, Ella's just my-- you know, girlfriend. Well done, pal. Excuse me. Enjoy the party. Thank you. Sorry. I don't know why I said that. That was-- that was weird. Why don't you go get me a drink. Preferably something in a glass, - Not a doggie dish, okay? - I'm on it. Okay. - And some hand sanitizer. - Ooh! Hello. (door opening) I need to talk to you. Yeah, I'm actually going to be late for class, David. Sorry. Look, Lauren, I can feel you drifting away from me, all right? I've been trying to figure out why, and I... I think that maybe you can tell that I'm hiding something from you. - Are you stealing again? - No. I told you I've given all that up. A couple days ago, I got a letter from Vanessa. - Dr. Mancini's wife? - It was written before she died. Before they were married... we kind of got together. I don't know how else to say it, but Noah's my son. - Look, I know it's a shock. - I'm not running from it. I want to be there for him. I want to be there for you... - David, I can't. - Can't what? Lauren. I can't be with you anymore, David. - What? Why, 'cause I have a kid? - No. Um... no. Actually, I'm... I'm really happy for you. - I know how much you love Noah. - Then what's this about? Lauren, what the hell's going on? We're just different people. On different paths. I'm sorry. I got to go. Hey. Just healed the sickmended the, fondled the sleeping. Looks like my day is done. No visible blockage. She should be able to hear me. Yeah, too well, Drew. Wow, I am way late for my day job. Time for Drew Pragin, med student, to turn to Drew Pragin, man for hire. - Yes, I sell my body for sex. - Don't judge me. What Hey, hey, hey, are you okay? dge me. - What's... going on? - Nothing. Look, if... you need a break or you want me to cover one of your shifts, I can help you out. (sighs) Thank you. I'm okay. (car approaching) Hey, bud. Sorry about what happened on that Yacht with you and Hassan. My cousin hates being shown up. - Ancient history. - I want to talk about the future. I know of a score... big. Diamond ring, seven carats. Worth at least a mill. Are you working jewelry shops now? It's a house in the Palisades. Real shady dude. Security guy tipped me off. You talking that much cash, it's gonna take some time, bro. Listen, I don't have a lot of time You talking that much cash, it's I need the money tomorrow. You got to help me out. (sighs) You bring me that rock, I'll see what I can do. All right? â™ª For he's a jolly good puppy, for he's a jolly good puppy â™ª â™ª For he's a jolly good puppy, that nobody can deny. â™ª Okay, promise me we never host a doggie birthday. For the dog that we don't own together? - You don't want a dog? - No, No, No. You see, dogs and I don't really match up. What do you mean? All the hair everywhere, the throw up, the humping of the leg. It's like living with a frat boy on all fours. - I'm sor... - Oh, but, of course, - if you... want to... - No, it's cool. Um... guess I shouldn't bring up my whole hamster idea now, though. I swear, all these people-- it's like they jumped off the cover of Variety.</i> It's Michael Hoover, Abby Douglas's agent, - 12 o'clock high. - It's time to mingle. All right, I can get my schmooze on. Lead the way. Uh-uh. I suggest we do the divide-and-conquer strategy. You take the east link, I take the west. (whispers): We'll meet in the middle. - Okay, the, uh, the flank thing... - I can do that. Yes. - Promise me you won't stray too far. - Okay. - Hey, Drew! - What...? - My... - Jonah. - Wow. Since when do you moonlight as a rock star? Oh, man, I always wanted to play to a crowd that howls. Barking not so much. (chuckles) I went to high school with these guys. We could have been huge, except for the slight lack of talent. Wait, what are you talk...? You guys rocked. I actually saw a Yorkie slam-dancing with a couple of Pekingese earlier. And I saw you with your girlfriend. - You are on fire, big boy. - Hotshot screenwriter, - hot agent. - Does it get any better? - I think hotshot's a bit of a stretch. - And Ella... I don't think you could quite call it girlfriend just yet. Jonah. Listen, I want you to meet Kyle Teller. He's a VP at Sony. He's got an assignment. It's a Seth Rogan project, and you're perfect for it. - Okay, Right now. - Awesome. Did he just say Seth Rogan? Why are yotalking to me? Go. - He did. - Oh, my gosh. - Hey. - Hi. Right on time. Come on in. Um, so I did a little research. Once we submit the school charter to the state, we can apply for 501-C3 status Then I think it's best if we do a two-tieredhool strategy, um...state, Whoa. Let's just slo . (chuckles) - I'm sorry. - No, don't apologize. I admire your energy and your ability to focus, given the circumstances. - I'm sorry? - Maybe we can acknowledge the elephant in the room, we can both relax a little. Oh, I meanst night in the limo. If you can put it out of your head, great, but... it's pretty much all I've been thinking about but... Right. Well, we kind of covered that. Sort of a non-starter. - Yeah. - Yeah, we did. - I broke up with Amanda. - What? She's great, but not what you would call a warm person, and that's-- that's who I need. I need someone who cares about other people - and not just herself. - Oh, I-ow what it's like to be confused about what kind of person is right for you. - I'm not confused. - I think people spend way too much time analyzing their choices instead of going with their instincts right in the moment. My patience only stretches so thin. Where is the painting? Well, I can't have that Breck kid come home and find a blank space on his wall, so I photographed it. A copy's being made. I'll swap them and get you the original later. You know, the dimensions are exactly the same. If Syd painted over the Van De amp with water soluble paint, she's a lot smarter than I thought. Or she's just another hack artist who likes to finger-paint. - We'll find out soon. - Don't you want to see what other little surprise I have for you? Your hunches always that dead on? (photographs rustling) (knocking) - Hey. - Hi. - Got a minute? I need some advice from the smartest person I know. - Okay. - Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I just didn't get much sleep last night. Lauren, you once slept through a 5.3 earthquAke. - What is going on? - I broke up with David. - Oh, my God. - I'm sorry. What happened? He'd better not have been cheating on you, or I swear... No wasn't. He wasn't cheating on me. It was just... You know, I've, I've been under so much pressure lately, with work and everything, it-it just got to a point where I-I had to make a choice, - and I chose to end it. - That's hard. I know how complicated it gets when work and relationshipshard get tangled up. Which is kind of why I came over here, but listen... - No, no, no. - Tell me. What? Okay. Ben Brinkley and I... (gasps) Are having an affair. Riley! - Have you slept with him? - No. - What about Amanda? - He broke up with her. - Oh, God. For you? - I don't know. Maybe. Oh... it's all so wrong, isn't it? Look, Riley, you just came out of a five-year relationship that didn't end well. Have some fun. Why not? (chuckles) - Oh, I bet you have. I bet you have. I don't really need to go into that, but yes, I have. - Hey. - Hi! I was just looking for you. Michael Hoover, meet Jonah Miller. I know that mug from the cover of the trades last week. Nice to meet you, Jonah. Call me, sweetheart. Oh. Bye, baby. Get home safe. (chuckles) Okay, I'm just curious. What was all that? - What was what? - You and that guy. Michael Hoover? He's an agent. We have a working relationship. Yeah, right. Define "work." Jonah, if I have to sweet-talk an agent to lock down a client, then so be it. I'm not having sex with the guy. No. You were just pretty much all over him. Wha...? No. I was flirting with him.</i> Guilty as charged. So what? Big deal. Who cares? I do. Call me old-fashioned,</i> but, like, I'm not a huge fan of watching my date practically maul some another guy. Okay. Jonah, listen. I like you. Okay? I really, really like you. But this whole notion of us together, and dinner with placemats and holding hands? I don't know. It's just... I've never done that before, okay? And to be quite frank, it seems a little suffocating. Well, then maybe you should get some oxygen. Good idea. I'm gonna go get another ride home. - Ella, I... - No, Jonah. Is this what couples do? They-they suffocate each other and stress each other out? Because if that's the case, then I guess couplehood is not for me. Hey! What do you think you're doing? What are you doing with my mom's ring? Listen, your dad asked me to steal this ring. He wants to claim it on insurance. Everybody wins... except the insurance company, but they're a bunch of crooks, anyway, so... (wry chuckle) You're smooth. But my Dad would never waste his money on insurance. - Want to know why? - Why? 'Cause he knows that no one in their right mind would ever think of stealing from him. He's really mean. You could get in, like, so much trouble if my father caught you. Okay. Well, why don't we just, uh, take that back and then we'll just act like none of this never happened? I have a better idea. I let you walk out of here with this ring in your pocket, and my dad never finds out who took it. And? What's the catch? You're really cute, you know that? So are you. (door opens) What is that? (groans) That'd be my dad. Go. The window. Wait. Forgot something. I'll take an IOU, okay? Jonah, you missed a wild afterparty. These two Lhasa Apsos got into the liquor. Long story short, don't ever go in that pool. (sighing): I wasn't much in the partying mood after Ella and I had a a Thrilla-in-Manila-size throwdown. What happened? So, I went and talked to that guy from Sony. He flat-out tells me, like, I have a serious shot at getting this writing gig. Nice. Yeah. With Seth Rogen. - Big deal? Huge deal. - Right. So, I'm stoked. I'm on cloud nine. I just want to find Ella and tell her and celebrate. I finally find her, and she's in the back of the party with some guy, - like, all over him. - Totally flirtin with him. Can I give you some, uh, unsolicited advice? And you don't have to answer that, 'cause I'm gonna give it to you anyway. "Different" doesn't even describe it. Mm. Yeah. From the looks of it, she seems, uh, pretty unpredictable, untamable, the type of chick who refuses to fit into anyone's mold. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. And, unless I'm wrong, you had a pretty well-defined thing going with Riley. Living together, totally committed and totally comfortable. And? And look where that got you. See, with a girl like Ella, you have to let go of all preconceptions. If you stop trying to make her into someone she's not, you may end up liking the person she already is. Heading out? Yeah. Um, I was just leaving. To meet with Ben? So, how is it, working together? Are you finding it stimulating? It's fine. Oh. I like what you're trying to do with this place. It's very, uh, youthful. Um, thank you. Anyway, I have some information that might interest you and Ben. - Great. - What is it? I love what the light does to your hair. Amanda... I'm... I would have never done anything like this if I didn't think... - Ben told me you two had broken up. - We did. Probably hours before your little couch tango. I bet he still had the scent of my perfume on him. What a nice way to thank me for getting you that job. - Oh, Amanda, I'm sorry. - You should be sorry. You crossed a line. I consider this a personal affront. And that's not something I take lightly. Oh, God... - So? - "So"? So? They're photos of two people kissing. Two single, unattached people. Ben, you know what this means. Yeah. Means I should learn to keep my drapes shut. And that this shirt makes me look paunchy. Well, I'm glad you can be so cavalier about this. - I feel horrible. - Why? I can't believe I was stupid enwugh to convince myself that this was okay. I can't stand being someone who goes after a man and hurts another woman in the process You mean manda,nd being someone my ex-girlfriend?after a man Ex or not, I hurt her. The very person who got me this job. Look, Riley, it's sweet that you're being so considerate, but trust me, Amanda will get over this. Underneath that makeup is a thin layer of galvanized steel. Let's just get past this. - No. I'm sorry. - I can't. Just feels too weird now. Well, that's unfortunate. Look, Ben, I really appreciate everything you've done, but maybe there's somebody else in your company that I could work for. I think that we would both feel more comfortable. No, Riley. I'm sorry, but that's not the way I work. I'm strictly hands-on. Well, then, I guess I'll have to find other sources of funding. You're kidding. And let all this good work go to waste? Nothing's going to waste. One way or another, I will make this school happen, even if I have to raise every penny by myself. (knocking at door) Hello, Drew. I thought, uh... I thought this might help you with your pent-up aggression. Who said I have pent-up aggression? You're right. You don't have pent-up aggression It is right out there for the whole world to see. Kidding. You seemed a little bummed at the hospital. And throwing darts at my face, well, if that doesn't make you smile, what will? Very thoughtful, thank you. And knowing how competitive you are, you'll probably kick David's butt every time you play. David and I broke up. - Wow. - I, uh... I didn't know that. (grunts softly) That explains - why you've been so... - Yeah. - All right, let's resort to plan B. - Come on. Where are we going? I am not going to let you mope around your apartment all night. I am going to take you out for a much-needed refreshment, alcohol requireD. - No. - Hey. Hey. - Hi. - Hey. Sorry. I, uh, just wanted to see how you were holding up. Oh, she's going to be much better after she knocks a few back. I didn't say that. Do you want to join us? No, that's okay. You two go. No. No, come with us. Come with us. You can't leave me alone with him. I might actually make her laugh. Oh, no. Who wants that? Now, you sit down. Read. Wait. - And you... - I'm coming. ...come help me choose something to wear. Can I watch? (sighs softly) (sighs) - Hey. - Hi. Need a drink? Can I have a Rum and Coke? - Coming up. - I guess you... you got David's mystery text, too, huh? Yeah. He, Said, "Good news. Come to Coal. Bring Ella." - Guess he thinks we're a couple. - He's always been a little slow. Look, Jonah, I'm sorry, okay? I tried. But if it means giving up who I am, then I guess I'm not couple material. No his and hers towels. No one drink, two straws. No. Guess a, uh, tandem bicycle's totally out of the question? Look... To be honest with you, I didn't exactly have the best role model when it came to relationships. The closest I got to seeing couplehood is my mom giving some guy a doughnut and a coffee as he was leaving the morning after. And, you know, for me, I'm on the other side of the spectrum. Like, I don't know how not to be a couple. It's not that I'm against the idea of somebody serious being there, and, well, I'd like that "someone serious" to be you. It's just... Well, it's going to take some adjusting. - Yeah. - From both of us? So... - have you ever done it in the MINI Cooper? - No. I can't say that I have. Well, then get ready to do some adjusting. (chuckles) - Fantastic. - You want your drink? - Three margaritas, please. - Is that cool? Yeah. But then what are you guys going to drink? - Finally, she's loosening up. - Very funny. - Hey, guys. - Hi. Hey, Jonah, Ella. Nice to see you guys without the wagging tails. I was at this A-list Hollywood party today Nice to see yoand you should've without the waggseen these two. The thick of all the glitz and glamour. Yeah. (sighs) Um, do you have any idea why David invited us down here? No. Um, I'm not on David's guest list tonight. We're not seeing each other anymore. - What? - What? Why? You guys were so happy together. Well, it's just complicated. JONAH: Okay. DREW: How about a toast? Okay. Uh, to... new jobs... new friends, and a new tenant who can outdrink all you amateurs. (forced laugh) In your wildest dreams, frat boy. Nuh-uh. Your money's no good. - Hey, man. - What's up, Dave? - Hey. So is this why you texted us all down here? So you could slip us cocktails and then take advantage of us? Something like that. You guys are looking at the future owner of Coal. - What? - Oh, my God, congratulations. - That's amazing. - Well done, David. David, I like a comped drink as much as the next girl, but this place is pretty steep, even for a trust fund baby. - How did you pull this off? - Yeah, David. How? - Well, I busted open the piggy bank. - Spent every last penny. And since it's only a matter of time before Mason Davis hands the keys over to me, tonight's on me. - That includes all of you. - Cheers to you, man. Thank you. (sighs softly) Miss me? What are you doing here? I saw your plates when you were driving away. I'm ready for my IOU, David Breck. Let's go inside.
