isn't without enemies." Daisy bates. {\a6}CHULA VISTA,CA Have you I.D.'D the body? It's a girl. One of the missing girls? All I can tell you right now is it's a girl. Did you draw up a list of those involved in the search? You're gonna find the parents of the girls on that list. Please tell me they didn't discover the body. No.As soon as our dogs caught her scent, we kept them away from the scene. She'd been missing 18 hours? That's correct. We found the body 5 hours ago. The parents have been here all this time? Yeah. And I'm running out of excuses. I'm gonna go talk to them. - J.J.,I'll come with you. - Thanks. I gotta be honest,guys. I'm glad you're all here,because I have never seen anything like that. Her face and her hands have been obliterated. Bruce and i were out for dinner. Jack dropped off the girls at the movie theater. And I arranged to pick them up,but they never came out. I went inside,but they weren't there. And an usher told me he saw them leave the,uh,the theater halfway through the movie. Where'd they go? He said they went outside for a cigarette. We didn't even know katie smoked. - Did he say if they came back inside? - No. We've been here all day. Why won't they let us know who that is? 'Cause they don't know who it is. Do they? Why? What did they do to her? Look,until we know who it is and what's happened,we-- by "we" you mean the fbi,right? We're only here to help the police find out who did this. Well,it's a little late for that,don't you think? I'm pat mannan,jack's friend. His wife passed away a few years ago. Lindsey's all that he has. Developed bruises,cuts,layer upon layer. Bindings cut deep into her flesh. And around her neck there's heavy bruising. She was strangled to death. A belt was used. You can see the indentation marks of a buckle. But why destroy her hands and face? It indicates she knew the attacker. By destroying her I.D., They're hoping to delay you making a connection between the victim and the unsub. It gives him time to get away. Do you think the other girl's still alive? Until we find her body,we should assume she is. One thing's for sure-- this is only the dump site. We need to figure out where she was killed. And which girl we're looking for. Excuse me. Mrs. Owen? The message katie left-- would you mind I see what we can make of it? Yes,of course. Thank you. Why? You said she made the call at 11:20. It's possible katie was with whoever took her. Mr. And mrs. Owen. Mr. Vaughan. I'm sorry,but we're gonna have to move the body for further examination. You know,I can identify her. I'll know if it's katie or lindsey. I can do it. Until we find something conclusive,I would advise against that. Garcia. Hey,angelfish. Right back at ya. I got a cell phone number for you. 619-555-0199. Access the last message left. I need you to put it through a filter. So can do,but it will require all my faculties. I'll call you back in a sec. Please,no,please. Please stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Don't fight them. Don't! Oh,please,god,stop! Don't show them you're scared. Daddy,help me,please! It lasts exactly 53 seconds,and then it goes dead. {\a6}CHULA VISTA POLICE DEPT. I think she was strangled. What do you want to do? Do?There's nothing else to do-- the parents can I.D.The voice. Are you serious? No,no,sir,they can never hear this. It'll be the fastest way to figure out who we're looking for. There's gotta be another way. Dna? LINGTHY TORTURE  FLESH CUTS My feeling is by the time we got the results back, it would be too late to save whoever they still have. It's up to you. This message,what did it record? It's the... last moments of one of your daughters' lives. Oh,my god. If you choose to wait,you can make a public appeal to the media. Either way,we're still looking for one of your daughters. Live app-ieal- don't think that's a good idea,jack. Why not? Because we know they're set up to see the reaction of the parent,check for signs of guilt. Is that true? In some cases. I'm sorry,bruce,I can't do this. I'M...sorry. Go ahead,garcia. Please,please. Please,no,please. Please,stop it! Stop it!Stop it! Don't fight them. Don'T. Oh,please,god,stop.

Help me! P-play it again. Mr. Owen... that's not katie. I know her voice. That's not her. That's not katie. Bruce. Mrs. Owen,I'm so sorry. No. No,lori,it's ok. It's not her. Bruce... no,jack. Jack. Jack,it's not katie,right? - You know-- - bruce. Jack,it's not katie. - It's katie. - No. No,it's not. Jack,please... Come on. I want lindsey's picture everywhere. What they did to katie took a long time. It was very violent and we know katie screamed. Yet no calls from complaining neighbors.Why? They're weren't any. The abduction site is 9 miles north of the dump site on the edge of town. Both are indicators of a comfort zone, so I'm assuming the kill site is somewhere between these 2 points. That's a wide area. Do a grid search. Narrow it down to wooded areas,industrial sites,abandoned houses. He needed privacy and he needed a controlled environment. What's critical right now is a heavy police presence. Rossi,in the morning I want you,reid,morgan to go in and search jack vaughan's house. Prentiss,you and I will go to where the girls were last seen. Prentiss: 2 girls missing,one dead,and life goes on as though nothing happened. Holiday weekend. What do you expect? A sense that something's changed. Do we know what movie they saw? Whatever it was,they left halfway through to have a cigarette. What do you think they're talking about? Boys. Think their parents know they smoke? Mine didn'T. And if they saw me dressed like that--ho ho. Two teenage girls free of parents,breaking the rules,and dressed like that for a reason. Here comes the reason. They obviously don't know them. But they want to. Do you think they'll go with them? Since news of katie's death? No. See? So,brightly lit. No alleys. Wide-open holiday weekend. Hard to abduct 2 girls without being seen. Unless they knew whoever took them. Jack Vaughan's Residence CHULA VISTA,CA What happened to lindsey's mother? Does it matter? It does to lindsey. It's called victimology. It helps us understand more about lindsey. How? How she carries herself. How she interacts socially with others. She's just like any other 15-year-old. No,she's not. I'm sorry? Everything in our house is an externalization of ourselves. This room isn't what you'd expect of a teenage girl. No J.T.Posters. No framed pictures. No journals,no cuddly toys. The walls are a mute tone. All this suggests that lindsey keeps herself hidden. She's shy and... shares very little with others. Except to one person-- katie. Garcia? All that from this room,huh? Is he wrong? Her dad,jack,he-- he never lets up. I mean,he doesn't let her... reid,I ran a check on the folks involved in the search. All good. Nice neighborhood,no sexual offenders. But,here's the big news. I found a blog katie ran on faceplace.Tv. She talks a lot about lindsey,and,boy,she did not like lindsey's dad. Cleans for him,and-- he treats her like a wife,not a daughter. He's just-- he's just a creep. Lindsey and jack moved to chula vista 6 years ago. Up until 9,according to katie,lindsey lived in maine. Jack owned a fishing boat with his 3 brothers,mom stayed at home. But then,tragedy struck. Fish stock went down,dad was forced to sell his boat, the family fell apart,mom died in a car accident. It sounds familiar. It should. It's the exact life story of a girl named lindsey in a book called the emerald sea of dreams. I've read it like 5 times. If lindsey stole her name and her story from a book, why didn't her father say anything about it? And his computer's set to automatically clear the web browser history and wipe the temp file on a daily basis. Give me his I.P.Address. 374... Nothing. Must be using a gray box proxy server. It makes tracking his internet history impossible. can I help you? Reid? I was just,uh,checking to see if lindsey had contacted anyone on the internet. Predators tend to-- tend to do that. - Is that right? - Yes. Statistically,actually,43% of predators-- lindsey doesn't like computers. Cool. Excuse me. Doesn't look much like a home. State-of-the-art security system,but the furniture looks rented. The walls are bare of any real art. The shelves are devoid of any family photos. Spyware wipes your computer file history daily. Awhatre you getting at,agent? In the recording,katie said what you'd expect of any teenager about to die. She begged for her life. Lindsey did exactly the opposite. Which is what? Lindsey's emotional response and the-- and the words that she chose to say in a situation as violent as the one she faced... strongly suggests-- look--lindsey was either coached or she's experienced sexual abuse before. You son of a bitch! No! Let me go! Gun! Put your hands where I can see them,both of you! Do not move! Stop! Ok? Ok,just calm down. I'm gonna reach into my pocket... and I'm gonna take out a badge. Just calm down. Ok? United states marshal. Jack and lindsey are under my authority. Which is what? Witness protection. What's going on? I'm gonna go find out. What's wrong? It's nothing out of the ordinary,mrs. Owen. Have they found lindsey? We haven't found lindsey,no. Now,why don't we all just go inside? No,I want to talk to jack. You can,as soon as they're done. You're trying to keep me away from jack. Why? What's going on? Jack's in witness protection. 10 years. Must be real important. Why didn't you tell us immediately? Because he's a state's witness whose identity needs to be protected at all costs. You know,jack,this may not have anything to do with-- - with what? - His past? Jack,every person in this room,with the exception of him,is here for your daughter. If this does have anything to do with me,they'll be coming out of boston. Irish-american. 2 or more men. Let's get them back to the station and keep them there until this is over. Hey,you know,you have no idea who or what you're dealing with here. Then enlighten me or stay out of my way. He's under arrest? No,he's not under arrest. Mr. Owen,please don't make this harder than it is. You're lying to me. Jack? - Rossi. - Mr. Owen,please calm down. Let go of me. What's going on? I want to know what he did to my katie. Ok,first you need to calm down-- don't tell me to calm down. Why are you arresting him? Sir,we're just asking him questions. That's it. Jack! If you had anything to do with this,I swear,I will kill you! That's enough,sir! That's enough. Garcia. Sir. I need you to check flights for the last 72 hours into san diego, orange county,and private airports as well. We're looking for one,maybe 2 men,possibly irish,out of boston. I got it. Checks motels,hotels,car rentals,everything you can. I've interviewed hundreds of killers. All types of crazy motives for doing what they did. They all share one thing in common. All of them. It's in their eyes. Until what they hold most precious is gone... and then they're lost. Just like the rest of us. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! You stop! shut up. You could have just asked. I would have turned it off. You don't know,do you... who I am? But I know who you are... lindsey. And now you know who I am... and what I can do... what I will do... if you don't shut up! one way or another,you're gonna die. Ladies first. Who do you work for? The mccrelan corporation,from boston. I love how you guys sell that. By "corporation," you mean the mob,don't you? No one's been able to get anything on them. Until now. That's because they murdered anyone who was a threat to them,civilians and cops alike. Is that what you did,jack? Did you eliminate the threat? Do those pills help the memories,or do they just hide the real jack? The only thing that keeps me alive is lindsey. What they did to katie,do you think that was a message to you? If it is,it's working. Do you recognize the method? I didn't send messages. I just went straight to the source. In 2 weeks' time,the mccrelan brothers will face trial. It looks like the mccrelans are gonna walk. Where? All right. Thanks. You were right. We just found something in an abandoned house. Lindsey? Where,exactly? Here. On the outskirts of town. It's still in the comfort zone. What does that mean? It means the unsubs are local. Still here. Let's go. Agent hotchner. Whatever you find,I want to see her. What is it to the dump site,5 miles? - 6.2 miles south. - Why? Why didn't they dump katie's body on the other side of town? And risk heading out on the open road while everyone was out looking for the girls. Something forced them to move on. Katie's cell phone. 2 different sets of footprints. 2 unsubs. Jack said there'd be 2 of them. There's cigarette butts everywhere. For professionals,this is a real mess. Multiple beer and liquor bottles. This could be the belt they used to strangle katie. You'd think they'd just want to do the job and move on. They're sending a message. Why obliterate the I.D. And hide the body? Why not go straight to the source? Garcia checked all the names against the ice database and nothing. Katie and lindsey may have left the movie theater of their own free will, but they sure didn't count on coming here. So this has nothing to do with the mob? Hey,guys,this blood trail goes all the way out the back here. Must have run out this way. Maybe it was lindsey. Well,whoever it was,they lost a lot of blood. It's thinner the further we go. It's an arterial bleed. And it stops here. Ok,spread out. Search the grounds and every house. Guys,the last house on the left,second floor. I've got something. He was stabbed 3 times. Look at his face. Scratch marks.Both arms. And on his hand a bite mark. These are all defensive wounds. At some point for him,things got out of hand and he wanted out. And whoever he was with wasn't about to let that happen. He makes a run for it and... gets stabbed in the process. It's dark. They can't find him. They think he's gone to the police and they have to think fast,so they take katie... and they dump her across town. And to maintain some amount of control,they take lindsey. This is one of our unsubs. We just need to find his friends. A teenager did this? He was involved. So do you think she's still alive? I do. But I also think you should let us do our job. Can you do that? Like I said,jack,this has nothing to do with you. Nothing to do with me. This punk kid took my daughter. All this,jack,it's karma,for what you did to all those people. Defensive wounds,bite indentations,scratch marks on his face,hands, and arms all indicate that he was involved in the murder and abduction of katie and lindsey. He's just a teenager. So were the lords of chaos. 3 teenagers bewitched by a boy named kevin foster. Kevin persuaded his friends to murder their own high-school teacher. Social dynamics of teenage boys. In this case,intoxicated by drugs and alcohol. When worked up into a frenzy by a dominant male, the adolescent mind can be pushed past what the adult mind perceives as acceptable. Hotch: What started out as a good time quickly devolved, and katie fell victim to the violent drunken rage of a juvenile gang. Check every high school in the chula vista area,males between the ages of 15 and 18. Ok. chula vista has 7 public schools and 3 private schools,so I'm gonna need more than that. Uh,let's see here. Brown hair,5'9",approximately 142 pounds. More. Most of the activity's in the southeastern district. The socio-economic dynamic's predominantly working class. Look within a 3-mile radius of the castle park area. 2 high schools. Start with the largest. Ok,let's see what we got. I got,like,5 faces. Jinkies. We believe this unsub got scared and wanted out. And the dominant male,in order to maintain control,attacked him. Douglas silverman,18 years old. We need to interview kids in his class,parents,teachers,find out who his friends were. It's at least 2 or more boys. One older,early to mid-20s. He'll think of himself as a real badass,somebody who broke the rules,defied the system. And have flunked or gotten kicked out of high school,possibly the same one. He'll also have a record-- petty theft,larceny. But douglas silverman's been missing for 2 days. How come no one's called? It's a 3-day weekend. His parents are out of town,or he called,said he's ok. And now that the weekend's over,I can tell you with what's happened,it's gonna end violently. We still got a chance to get out of this. After what you did? What chance? What you did,too. Remember? I didn't kill her. Says who,huh? You? It's your word against mine,bud. I just want this to end. It will,all right? You just gotta relax and you gotta trust me. What do we do? We got something they want. Now we just need a gun. What? A gun? Where are we gonna get that from? You said that your old man had one,right? - He let you shoot it one time? - No. No,no way. I'm not doing it. Listen,we can get out of this. We have her.All right? Go get the gun. You really are as dumb as you look. You're forgetting one thing. I saw what you did. Don't matter. 'Cause none of us are walking away. What is it? How can I help you? - Mr. Silverman? - Yeah. I'm ssa hotchner. This is ssa prentiss. - Is there someplace we can talk? - We can talk here. - It would be better if- - what's this about? It's about your son doug. My son doug? When was the last time you spoke to him? Well,hang on. I can call him for you here. Sir,he's not going to answer. Sir. His name's doug silverman. He went to the same high school as katie and lindsey. Maybe. I don't know. Why? Has he got something to do with this? All we know right now is he was involved. There are others. - So this has nothing to do with jack. - No. Why,I vetted every boy that came into katie's life,made sure I knew everything about them. I had to. I can't afford to forget a face. His I've never seen. Maybe these guys,she didn't want you to meet,afraid of what you might say or do. Lindsey and i don't have any secrets. That's not quite true,though,is it? No,it is true. She knows who I am,what I was. 10 years ago your wife died in a car accident. Is that why you turned state witness? I promised my wife on her death bed that I would do whatever was necessary to protect lindsey. Did you tell lindsey it was supposed to be you in that car and not her mom? Yes. Why,then,with all that you taught her,would she allow herself to get caught up in this? She wouldn'T. What about katie? Boys suck. Especially at my school. They're all so... busy being busy. There's this one guy,though. Real cute. Hangs out with 2 dweebs. But lindsey says to stay away from him. Go. Back to high school boys who flunked out or got kicked out. Go back 10 years. Lindsey says there's-- there's something not right about him. I think katie's talking about him right now. Thanks,garcia. But she's never met him. I don't know. Where are you,you son of a bitch? No,no,no,he wouldn't do this. He did what he was told to do. Oh,wait. What was he told? I mean,doug is a real shy guy,ok? He doesn't make friends easy. Has he changed recently,become a little more defiant? His grades slipping? I thought it was just a phase. A phase manipulated by someone who targeted your son for his own needs. Did he ever mention anyone to you? Oh,god. A couple of months ago,there was this older kid. I--I said invite him over for supper and he didn't want to. Ryan. Ryan. I don't know. Oh,god. How am I gonna tell his mom? Lindsey protected katie like a--like a sister. So if a few boys pulled up curbside and offered katie a ride? Lindsey would have gone along to make sure she was ok. Lindsey is still alive because of what you taught her. I taught her to stay away from men like me. I'd like to speak to jack if I may,to apologize. Sure. 5 years we've known each other. No... - Bruce,I'm so sorry. - Just...listen,please. I don't know who you are or what you've done. All I want to know is,are you capable of still doing whatever it is you did? Why? That dead kid up there... I know who he is. I know who he hangs out with. Garcia: Ok,I got 3 ryans. The ryan we're looking for probably went to high school with lindsey and katie a few years back. He got expelled or at least flunked out. Ryan phillips. He was expelled for smoking pot years ago. Oh,no. - Reid,what's going on? - He's taken my car. The bastard took my car. This is pat mannan. All units,all units,I want an apb out on jack vaughan. Jack's taken off. We heard. Where's he gonna go? He can't know where lindsey is. - No,but he might know who's got her. - How? You showed bruce owen doug's photo,right? He recognized it. Which means he knows who doug's friends are. So now he's sent a psychopath after his daughter's killer. Garcia's got a name. Ryan phillips,28. Needs get a unit over to phillips' house before jack turns up there. On thing's for sure-- we know ryan won't be there. We'd better figure out where he is before jack does. Come on. Come on,damn it. You need a hand with that? Who the hell are you? I'm mr. Vaughan. - What are you doing in my house? - Lindsey. Where's my daughter? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Yeah? I think you do. Hey,what are you doing? Stop! Get out of my house! What are you doing? This thing's not loaded,is it? What are you doing? Oh,god! Oh,god,you shot my leg. You got 2 legs. I got one question. Where's my daughter? You gotta find him,and fast. What does it look like I'm doing? Coloring in a map. All the activity is focused in the southeastern district. The abduction site,the dump site,ryan phillips' house. There's gunshots coming from jackson street. Are you coming? 3-day weekend,you've gotta find a secure,private location. Where? Army of cops and feds all over town. It's gonna be real hard. Every abandoned building,warehouse,lockups-- it's all been searched. Guys,it seems jack just paid a kid named taylor coleman a visit. Paramedics are working on him now. Reid,good news,please. After inputting all the sites, I've come up with a 2-dimensional probability service overlay map that indicates the offenders' operating eaar. Reid,where is he? I know it sounds crazy,but I think he's taken her to the mayford high school 2 blocks from here. I'll meet you there,and reid...Be careful. thanks. Mayford high school. Damn it,pick up the phone! He's not coming back,ryan. What are you gonna do now? Looks like it's just you and me. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. It's something I've been meaning to do all along. See,I wasn't really that into katie. You. There's something special about you. Where you goin',baby? What you do to me will be nothing compared to what my dad will do to you. I'm scared. Go on,daddy,kill him! You son of a bitch,you killed her! He killed katie. Kill him! Kill him,daddy! - Put the gun down! - Please!Please help me! Jack,put down the gun. She begged him to stop and he laughed at her! He laughed at her! I didn't laugh at her. I would change it if I could. But I can'T. Please... - just don't kill me. - Jack... you swore to your wife you'd protect lindsey. Listen to her,jack. Listen to what she wants. She's-- she's begging you to kill somebody right in front of her. What do you think your wife wanted you to protect her from? Jack... your life has been,uh... it's been about violence,and if... you do this,lindsey's will be,too. Do you want that? No,you don't want that! When does it end,jack? - Put down the gun! - Kill him. When does it stop? Tomorrow. I think it came from in here. Let's go. Hang back! Hang back! you ok,reid? I--I tried. I tried,really. I couldn'T... what's gonna happen to jack? It depends... how important a witness he is. "It is a wise father who knows his own child." William shakespeare.
