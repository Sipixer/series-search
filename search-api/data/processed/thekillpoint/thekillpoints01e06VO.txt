and we can all walk out of here safe and sound. Fall back! This is now a hostage situation. Who is this? - Captain Horst Cali. - I'm Wolf. Mr. Wolf. - That girl was an acceptable casualty. - Know your place, corporal. We'd like to get in touch with someone from sergeant Mendez's platoon. That's a good godamn man in that bank. They're all good men. Sent Leon in with a scrambler. Gonna get you home, sergeant. - Bring Leon back in. - Gone. Tonray, put an A.P.B. on Leon. If Wolf has anybody out there, I'll find him and detain him. We gotta get outta here. - No, I'm scared. - I'll protect you. I promise. Our boy've wait a lot time to talk to you. - Can't you see they're using you? - I'm using them. The bug on the photograph needs to be within 3 feet for us to hear them. It's the creepy me's mission to find the original, take over, and do as much evil as it can. - That's it, it's over. - Don't move. Take her gun, man. Take it! After several days here at Three Rivers Trust, iraqi war veteran Jake Mendez</i> and four of his platoon mates remain inside the bank.</i> Over the course of negotiations, the Pittsburgh Police have successfully managed the release of several hostages.</i> But as we know, an unknown number of people</i> remain inside with the armed hostage takers.</i> Stay tuned to News 14. Cap, something's coming through. Uh, I don't know what he's saying. It sounds like gibberish. Arabic. What the hell is going on in there? It's not me walking hollow. It's not... It's not me. No, it's not me, you can't see me. Mike? Don't call me. I can't listen. I can't listen. An empty shell. Finding hell, finding me. The creepies crawl and find us all. FIND ME, FINDS US ALL! (del vo) Come on. Hey, Mike... It'll be all right, brother. Just hold on a little while longer. Let me take a look at this. The devil, its... It's finding me. The creepies crawl and find us all. It's the creepy me's. I don't know what this "creepy me" shit is, but clearly someone in there done lost their nut. It's gotta mean something to somebody. Just get as many people down here as possible. You want a big protest? The bigger the crowd, the better it's gonna be. - <i>Can you do it?</i> - Don't worry, I'm gonna do my thing. That's right, just let me know when you're ready to roll. Call me. Sarge, mike is real bad. I can't keep the gangrene localized. It's necrotizing, spreading through his body. He's damn close to septic shock, if it hasn't already set in. You think he can move on his own? Yeah, probably. Why? 'Cause extraction plan's in place. We got exactly 2 hours to get the hell outta here. Episode 1x06 Transcript: swsub.com / Sync: DarKsh Hey, hey, ho, ho, let our brothers go. Right on time, fellas. Status, Stan. Yeah, we're close. Real close. Keep moving, buddy. Keep moving. Remember when you told me to track on Wolf's platoon mates? - Yes, Tonray, you remember to do it? - Yes. Something just came over the security desk at Pittsburgh International. Check it out. Two of Wolf's platoon mates flew in a couple days ago. Positive I.D. on Stanley Grimes and Charles Derzius. - These men flew in two days ago? - Yes. - And I'm just finding out now? - A lot of people pass through the airport, Cap. I'm surprised I fou... Yeah, Tonray, but only 2 people from the 1013 platoon pass through the airport. Where are Derzius and Grimes now? They haven't checked into any hotels. I'm keeping tabs on their bank accounts. Forget about your tabs. Use your instinct, can you do that? - My instinct? - Yes, your instinct. Use the brain in your head. And tell me why you think they are in town. - Now? - Spit it out. He's obviously re-assembling his platoon here in Pittsburgh. Putting together a team to help assist him in some shape or form or capacity. If that was indeed the case, it'ld help explain the presence of one-armed Leon, the political elements, and of course the impractical demands that Wolf is making. That's my general gut feeling, Captain. Well, okay then. I'm gonna get us outta here, man. Little brother, we're gonna start over again, just you and me. Do you hear me, Mike? Come on, man. Done three tours and it feels like home. I just found out that I'm going home. Gettin' my brothers and I'm going home. Back to the States where I got no home. It smells like ass in here. Yeah, well, I guarantee you I'm contributing heavily to that. It's disgusting. And it's rude. Oh, I'm sorry law man. I forgot your education and white collar gig prevents your pits and prizes from carrying the same level of stink. Oh, God, I can't take this. - I'm getting cabin fever. - You had your chance and you blew it! We'd be home soaking our shit up nice in the tub if you pulled your weight. And the trigger. I'm sorry I couldn't do it. I couldn't kill him. - What do you want me to say? - Nothing! I don't want nothing from you. Daddy's not here to help, - so how can you ever help yourself? - That's enough. Leave her alone. Could you have done it, tough guy? Shot Mr. Pig in the head, point blank just like that? I would've lined them up and executed them one by one without hesitation. Then why didn't you? Let us out, please! We can't breathe... And we need to use the bathroom! Please. Albert. Please. I... I screwed up again, bro. La, la... brother. Put on your poker face. Don't let anyone see she got to you. We're trash, bro. Okay? Low life grunts. We've no place in her world. We never will. She's not programmed to care about us, people like you, underprivileged. So learn your lesson. Know your place on the bottom. But let's be the best we can be in our basement, right? Saddle up, soldier. Extraction plan almost underway. Hey, guys, guys, Big Stan and Derz're in the train tunnel below us trying to dig through the floor. They can't come directly through this floor, it's reinforced steel. That's right, the best they can is come through next door. We got a couple of swaties, but I'm gonna distract them. - Distract them how? - I got it covered. We're getting outta here. Just prep for exit. I get Abe to shut off the wall sensors. - Yeah, get all of it. - No, let me do that. I got some unfinished business with him anyway. Hey, hey, Ho, ho, let our brothers go. Damn. The mind, Johnny-boy. The mind banks all memories, good and bad. Locks 'em in our vault, you know? Just can't shake unsightly shit. I got a one-armed guy - <i>inside the perimeter.</i> - Description? Mid-forties, six feet tall, missing his right arm elbow down.</i> Not him. Our guy's missing his left. You think he's got another one-armed guy coming off a train? Same question, which arm? Which arm? Not Leon. This guy was missing both arms. A man missing both arms is not a one-armed man. Put out an A.P.B. on Derzius and Grimes. Crowd is out of control. The more these vets show up, the worse it gets. You seeing? - Yes. - Godamn zoo! Let's hope the protest is the only reason they're here. This explains the amputees, cap. Think it's why Derzius and Grimes're here? No. Maybe Wolf's political agenda isn't bullshit. If that's the case, we're back to zero. Let's worry about what this means after we get this contained, okay? Everything's in place, sarge. I made some calls. We got a lot of brothers out there.</i> Great. I'm ready. Make sure those swaties keep their eyes on you. We need five minutes. Captain, I'm coming outside. - You're ready to talk to me again? - <i>Oh, yeah.</i> But not just to you, buddy. Hold your fire! What're you doing Wolf? - You're married Cap? - What? - You've got kids? - What are you talking about? There're certain rules of engagement regarding families of combatants. And you broke every single one of 'em. Listen to me, I brought your son so you might know you still have something to live for. Yeah, where are my demands? Flak jacket for every soldier? The child of every senator enlisting? Where are those demands? - Tell them where they're at. - Why don't you tell me what you really want, huh? Tell me. You might have some of them believing this political bullshit, but I'm not one of them. I'm glad to see all of you here, man. I'm glad you made it down. - Times running out. - I thought the whole world was against us for a minute. - Not all of us are with you, sergeant. - It's okay, pops. Don't worry. It's your right, man. It's a free country last time I checked. That's all I'm doing here. I'm exercising my freedom of speech. That's right. And I'm glad to see my brothers from Baghdad. Good to see you made it down, man. My sisters from Fallujah. Good to see, y'all. Khe sanh. The brig. Hey, good to see you, man. I'm glad you made it. I'm glad you made it down. Everybody's here. I'm so proud to see you here, man. 'Cause the longer they make us wait, the stronger we're gonna get. Right? 'Cause my platoon, we did two tours. That's 15 months of hell. Let's go. We're moving you. Where? Where am I going? Wait... Shut up. Move along. Look, I really... I just wanna speak to... Marshal? Marshall, we gotta lock him up, man. Just give him one more minute. Go ahead, what? Of course it's possible to do a wire transfer. But they'll see what bank the money came from, and they'll flag the account. Abe. You can do something here. Come on, man, don't shit me. Well, I mean, what we could... What we could do is we could transfer the money from multiple accounts. Like, you know, commercial and personal accounts. Then you route the money through different branches and create, like, a smokescreen, a labyrinth, if you will. If you will. Go ahead, yeah. Hell yeah, do that. Okay. All right. We were supposed to go home on december '05. And then they called us up and they said, "we need you boys." So they redeployed our asses to Mosul. Whole lot of killing in Mosul, man. And then they called me a coward, and they threw me in jail. You know why they threw me in jail? 'Cause I wouldn't let my men die for their war. That's why. 'Cause they'd rather have dead soldiers than live vets</i> 'cause it's a lot less embarrassing and a lot cheaper! That's why! So get me W!</i> All right, they're in position. Go. Go. Go. Get me anybody. Somebody who'll get shit done</i> and get me what I want. Die for your war. Tell me what for. Die for their war. Tell me what for. Why are you watching this? Because that's what he wants. All eyes on him. - Wants to be a celebrity then. - He certainly wants everyone's attention. Question is why. - We gotta figure that out. - That's what I'm trying to do. I want you all to show America what you gave for your country, 'cause I already showed them mine. It's your turn. Show America what you gave, man. Come on, show 'em. Show America what you gave for your country, man. That's right. Come on, show them. Come on, it's your turn. Come on, show America. It's your turn, man. Show 'em. Show 'em. That's it. That's right. Baby, show it all. Show America. That's right. Show America, man. Show America. Give me that. Gotta go, gotta go. Come on, fellas. Marshall, gotta go, gotta go. Come on. This the final conformation? Yeah, the transfer's gone through. What's he talking about? It may have taken us a couple of days instead of five minutes, but we finally robbed a bank, boys. - You're shittin' me. - Nah, man. It's clean and legit too. How much we lookin' at? A little bit over six mil. - $6 million? - Yeah, man. Hey, Abe, man, you were a little bit nervous, - but a wiz with those numbers. - Oh yeah? - Where's the pickup? - Canada. Great Falls bank. I figure that we just slide under the border. You know, drink, ski, screw till we, you know, tired of it. No, no, I don't do Canada, man. I'm going home. Just wire me my money. What home is that, Albert? Got a home? You're a marked man. You're running for the rest of your life, man. Think about that, brother. 'Cause I didn't think about that till just about now. Who's gonna take care of ma? What are we gonna do with her? We don't have to do anything with her. She's gonna be fine. Me and you, man. We start a new life together, that's that. Me and you. You do something to that transfer, Abe? What are you talking about? - What I'm talking about? - Calm down, I was over his shoulder the whole time. It's cool. Only one of us are gonna go in that bank in Canada, Abe. Just in case you did something stupid. In case you set us up. And if you did, I come back here, I find you in your sleep, and I peel your skin. That money's insured. If something happens, it's because you did something stupid. Not me. Come on, we gotta go. Do you hear me? We gotta go. Come on, fellas. Running outta time. If you're gonna kill us, you gotta let us know. It's the honorable thing to do. Come on, everybody, get your things. It's almost over. You're gonna go home soon. How are you getting out of here? Hey, don't worry. Don't worry. Just watch the news. Take me with you. Take me. - You might need a hostage. - No, I can't. How could I do that? You can run away all you want, but you don't want any part of my life. Trust me, you don't want to be part of that. Please just listen to me... Just listen to me for a second. I know how crazy this is. I have a connection with you. Please don't send me back to my life. Please, this is... This is... This is what I want. I know, I know, but not like this. Not like this. And not with me. You're gonna find your way, I'm telling you. You'll find that way. Come on, I'm sorry. Hang in, Mikey, we're getting out of here. I'm taking the A.K., brother. Good to see you boys. Big Stan! Good to see you, man. What's up, brother man? Derz, what's going on, man? Connie, this is Hawke. I just spotted Leon. - Are you sure? - <i>Definitely.</i> All right, stay back. Make sure he doesn't see you. - Monitor everything he does. - <i>Roger.</i> What's up, Connie? It's Leon, cap, we found him. All right, is he here for the protest rally? Or is he someone we should be concerned about? That's it. Hawke spotted him two blocks away. Key me into Hawke. Hawke, talk to me. What do we got? Male, mid-30s, one arm, got a cs40 ear bud, keyed the mike a couple times. He's talking to somebody. These 1013 guys are like cockroaches. All right, what do you think? Nowhere near the protest, talking to somebody, using an ear bud, we need to find out who's on the other end of that line. Maybe some of these guys were called by Wolf for reasons that weren't just political. If we question him, he's not gonna give us much, is he? Hardcore military. Doubt he'll say anything. Whatever we get from him, we gotta take. Then we're just gonna have to take it, aren't we? Leon keeps keying his mike. He's talking to somebody. He keeps looking around. Something's up. Bag him. It's time to move, Hawke. Find out who he's talking to. But make sure he doesn't alert whoever's on the line.</i> Do not let him key his mike. Connie, the photobug just went to static.</i> I heard some movement, rustling, and then whoosh... Gone.</i> In English, Tonray, what the hell does that mean? It was either crushed or flushed or moved somewhere out of range. Tell Hawke he has to move quickly. Go, Hawke! Nice and still. They're in a tunnel. Steel Plaza, the hts are in Steel Plaza tunnel. - Come on! - Hawke, hold. Team's on the way. That's why we lost the bug. You get extra people down there. Now go, move. Bravo, move your post immediately, meet Hawke at the gateway train, go! - What about the bank? - We can't risk it. We don't know if everybody's left the building. We go in when they come out. All right, guys, we're clear. Sarge, we gonna breathe. We're home free, boys! Put your weapons down now! It's an ambush! Move! Move back! All the way back, they are everywhere! Move and fire! Move and fire, man! I got no shots left! Fall back, fall back! Move and fire! Bring him here, bring him here! Come on, move! Damn it Henry, what's going on? Come and get your brother, man! Go, go, go! Move! Move! Go, go, go! Just hold on, relax. Everything's gonna be fine. Hold on, buddy, just hold on. Get in! What happened? - What'd you do? - I don't know! Move! Get out of the way. I can't believe Stan is dead. He died for his platoon. That's what we do, man, that's what we do. So close to walking out of here, man, so close. I know, Sarge, I was there, you know? You were there? What was the excuse this time, man? What was it? Yeah, lack of ammo, right? Is that the story this time? Like in Fallujah? I thought I was out, man. No walking out, no. Not supposed to walk out. Don't say that, don't say that. No restart. You can't be reborn. Especially not us. We're already dead. Thank you, Henry. Thank you, we all thank you. We all thank you. What? What?! Ready to start talking, soldier? Come on. How many of you 1013 boys were involved in this thing? Pretty well planned out, huh, Leon? Seems you were in it from the start. How else could they have coordinated an escape like that? Keep smiling, asshole. People have been shot. Innocent bystanders. Cops. You're involved in all of that now. You're an accessory. How do you think you're gonna fare in prison with that one arm? We can take it over from here, chief. That's it, that's it, going home, people. I never been so excited to see the police. There's always a first. Are you done? Keep your hands up. Do you have any water? It's time for you to start talking, soldier. 1013, pro patria. Don't you pull that shit with me. All kinds of vets are coming home scarred up, messed up, and pissed off! They got the strength to deal with it, because that is what we signed up for! The 1013, for our country. Damn pussy bastard. Pretty cool. 1013. Problem is, there ain't much left of the 1013, brother. In fact, you just lost two more brothers in the tunnel. Yeah, the 1013 is a dying breed. Your Sarge is running out of options. I'll tell you what. You help me, I help you. We help them. Talk to me. No? I got plenty of time to wait. So, am I correct in understanding that, the two of you spent that whole time in the closet? We locked ourselves in, then we heard all that noise. We panicked and we went out through the vent. It was awful. It was beautiful at times, but it was mostly awful. Yeah, it was mostly beautiful. And why were you in the closet in the first place? Hey, look at this. It's not good. Why is he always talking to me like that? It's okay. - Why do you think, Henry? - I don't know. You gonna tell me? Why not? I just try to prove myself to you, sir. Think you ever prove yourself to me? Aftewhat you did today? You can't prove yourself to me. You can never prove yourself. What are you looking at? Mind your business! Okay, that's enough. How dare you talk to me like that? How dare you be the one to challenge me? Did I take a fall for you? Didn't I take a fall? Didn't I put my life and my honor on the line to save your ass, didn't I do that? - I'm asking you to stop... - Boy, you answer me! Answer me, didn't I put my life and my honor and everything on the line to save your ass? You want me to get down and kiss your feet for the rest of my life, is that it? Thank you, Sarge. Thank you. Well done, Sarge. Don't talk to me like I'm a stupid idiot, because I'm not. No, you're not. You know what you are? What? You're a three tour Corporal. That's all you're ever gonna be. A three-tour Corporal. That's it. The war breeds leaders and machines. So which one are you, man? - I'm a leader. - Huh, which one is he? Don't do this, Sarge. Are you a leader, or are you a machine? Or maybe you're neither. Are you neither? - I'm gonna get transpo, Sarge. - Good. I'm getting 1013 out of here. Because you can't do it. You had your chance, and you couldn't do it. You do it, go ahead. Get on a bus, man, get on a plane, get on a boat. And do it, get out of here. - I will. - All right. Good luck, man, 'cause nobody's ever made it. You know why? 'Cause you can't make it. It'll never happen. Because you're not a leader, Henry Roman. Please don't do this, Sarge. 'Cause you're nothing. Don't do this. Nothing, clown. Platoon follows you and you're dead. And everybody's dead. I gotta go, Sarge. It's time for me to go. - What are you doing, man? - Get him! What are you doing, man? Come here! Come here. Mike, don't go out. Come here. Yo, Cap. We got movement. Somebody's coming out. All right. Let's go. Mike, come on. Mike, come back here! Snipes, hold position. Hold fire! Ground crew's got the shot, ground crew has got the shot. What's wrong with your man, Wolf? He's unarmed, he's unarmed! Just leave him alone, he's unarmed. He's unarmed. Come on, move back, move back. He's unarmed. Mike, mike, come here. Come here, man. Come on, little brother, come on. Come on, Mike, think about it. Don't do anything stupid. Horst, he's unarmed, man, back off.
