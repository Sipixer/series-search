and we can all walk out of here, safe and sound. Pull back! This is now a hostage situation. Give me the wallet, throw it down. Right there. - What do you have? - Who's this? - Captain Horst Cali. - I'm Wolf. This thing ends with us free or dead. - Chief Abrami? - Make contact. We'll distract them. I want a flak jacket for every soldier. And I want the son of every senator who voted yes to sign up for active duty. You know what's at stake, and I know how to play. Ask another question. That'll shatter a face. You kill a hostage, negotiations are over. Real estate magnate Alan Beck is indeed at the scene and his daughter Ashley is one of the hostages. She became our most valuable commodity. Without power, no contact with him. Kill the electric now! I give you exactly one hour to give me electricity back, - or I kill a hostage. - Me and Henry - know we're the assassins. - Mr. Wolf, choose me. Special agent Kerry Southwell died a couple of hours ago. We're bringing someone in from washington. As of now, you're a secondary negotiator. Follow these instructions. If you don't, your daughter and my son aren't gonna make it alive. - I'm a negotiator. - You're a secondary negotiator. In consultant capacity. Platoon 10-13 back in action. Let's get our boys home. If you're just joining us, we're approaching 18 hours here,</i> in market square as bank robbers continue to hold</i> a group of hostages inside. I have recently noticed a heavy FBI presence on scene as they appear</i> to be getting more involved after the death of agent Kerry Southwell.</i> Keep it here at news 14 as we continue to bring you live coverage. So let's negotiate. Save me and she's free. All right. Go ahead and send it. Bet you Beck already made the appropriate changes by now. What do you wanna do? I wanna put some heat on the FBI. What, man? Wh... What... What did I do? What's that, sir? What? - Rabbit! - Rabbit! Hey, come on, man. Snap out of it. Come on. Snap out of it, come on. Look at me. It's Jake. - Mr. Pig. - What's up? I got it, I got it. Episode 1x03 Transcript: swsub.com / Sync: DarKsh You see that, Johnny Boy? That little shake, slight tremble... Too much sodium in the blood. Not enough oxygen to the brain. Toxins, maladies, emotions... Biology. Two words that never stand side by side in my world, Johnny Boy, and that's second and chance. You lose balance, you lose lives. And last but not least, hormones. Oh, yes, Johnny Boy, testosterone is a killer. One voluptuous full-moon bubble ass on an african queen... can shake this entire world. - Mike. - Connie? Collect everything we have on the HTs. Tonray, I need a copy of the Sabian debrief for agent Ash, please. I'd like to get her up to speed immediately. Also get me a new set of headphones before we talk to Wolf again. Ear bud or over ear? So... Five confirmed HTs, ID'd by the two released hostages. We're gathering intel on 'em now. This is the leader, sergeant Jake Mendez, aka Mr. Wolf. He's calling the shots inside, the one I've talked to. We have a psych profile on him yet? We do. However, it's all over the map. He's a psychopath and a saint. His profile, his military file tell me nothing about the man I'm dealing with. I should talk to him cold. No introductions. That may throw things off-kilter. It's okay. I don't wanna give him options. - Let's keep him guessing. - Fine. Let's see how he responds. Super. I think we're in pretty good shape here. Now, I may lean on you a bit. Especially in the next few hours. Lean all you want. I intend to be here until everyone is out of that bank safely. Captain Cali, this is... an awkward situation. You're one of the best at what you do, and if I were in your shoes, I'd be pissed. I'm here to resolve this as quickly as possible, and I'm really glad you're here to help me, but I don't wanna have to explain the way I do things. Agent Ash... I think it's important to tell you that Wolf can be talked down. If we keep humanizing the hostages, preying on his emotions, I really believe we can extract one at a time. I'll keep that in mind, Captain, thank you. I'm gonna schedule a meeting with my team, and then we'll make the call to... Wolf. And I talked to my guys at green tree. They were able to track down Teddy Sabian boy's teacher. Turns out the kid's a genius. Some sort of computer prodigy. You're getting my bill when we get out of here. A new tattoo. Wow, look at that. You should have never gone into the military, man. You should have gone to art school. Look at this shit. It's good. Don't look at me that way, man. All right? It makes me feel pathetic. It's infected. Goddamn FBI. It doesn't surprise me. Mayor, media, Beck. Lethal combination. A lot of bureaucratic bullshit. Look at that ass. What? What's wrong with her ass? She's got a man's ass! I bet every nickel I've got, she was a shit's toss from being a man. God was indecisive when he made her. Flip-flopping... At the last second he just said, "Nah, give her some jugs, made too many boys today." Why the hell would Wolf release him? Why not a child? Why not a woman? Yeah, I hear you. He gains nothing making that move. Or does he? He holds the man's son. He can hold that over his head. But why would he need leverage on Teddy Sabian? Because his son is a computer whiz. Tonray... Find out if our communication block is still up. Got it. You think he's using that? I don't know. Cops on site? South side, couple dozen, not counting SWAT in the pit, and many more in the surrounding buildings. - Entry points? - The obvious ones are locked. There's a half dozen sewer drops, all in the line of sight. Derz, keep working schematics. Meantime, let's spread out, find a nice high vantage, set up shop. Need a direct line into the bank, but we need to drop a little... out of the mix. Watch mine. I don't like rabbits. Ever since I was a kid. I didn't like the easter bunny. I hated Bugs Bunny. I thought he was queer. No offense, Bernard. Or that energizer bunny, beating that shitty bass drum over and over. I add that Rabbit to my expanding list. I guarantee you... That whacked Rabbit bastard is gonna snap again and again, until one of us is done. What can we do? We need to talk to that lawyer about his gun. And then we need to talk to her. I like watching you sleep. You say that to all the girls? - You get anything yet, kid? - No, nothing yet. What's wrong? It's my birthday. Don't tell me you were having a birthday party today. - Yeah. - Oh, man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I can't let you go out, man. I'm sorry you're gonna have to miss the party. I can't. It's okay. It was gonna be lame anyway. Now, don't put yourself down like that. Don't do that, man. My dad's throwing me a pool party, okay? Now, how we even have a pool in the first place is a mystery. It's one of those, like, cheap aboveground pools. Yeah. We kind of float around like bobbers. Plus I've been a "shirtie" forever. - What's that? - You know, I wear my shirt in the pool. To... cover... My man cans. - This kid's crazy. - Yeah, I've got four friends too, and they're all dudes. I'm having a female free birthday party, and that's just really depressing. It is depressing man, but you know what? I was a shirtie too. I wore my t-shirt into the pool just like you. Yeah, right. I swear to God. I was a tubby kid. Husky. And I had it worse than you, man. I had a shitty hair cut, I had coke bottle glasses. It sucks. Yeah, it sucked. What kind of cake do you want? - Cake? - Yeah. I don't know. Doesn't really matter. I like all kinds. You know, actually, I don't really like meringue. I'm not exactly sure what that is. Nobody does. Hey, cap, I want a cake ASAP. Game's changed a bit, sergeant Mendez. Very interesting. Who may I ask is calling?</i> This is agent Ash with the FBI. You're gonna be speaking to me from now on.</i> - How do you do? - I do good. I do real good, but you know what? I'm not good at breaking in new shoes, if you get my meaning. It's too uncomfortable, the chafing, the blisters are a bitch,</i> - besides, I don't wear heels, get it? - Noted. But we find ourselves in a situation where you don't have very many choices. Where's the other guy? We had an understanding, a rapport. Can I get him back, please? - Not possible. - In these circumstances anything is possible, where is he? Reassigned. I'm here to help you, sergeant Mendez. I really am. You wanna help me? Get me a goddamn cake. That's not the way this is gonna work. You know what's on people's minds when they yell "surprise" </i> at your 40th birthday, or... Or you're giving your wedding vows, you know what people are thinking? They think, "How good is that cake? And how big a piece am I gonna get?" That's what they're thinking. You dress up, bring a gift, and you know what you end up with?</i> You end up with an empty plate, and a fork full of frosting. This is a waste of time, sergeant. Now you listen to me. Ash, Ash, I want a cake, okay? A big-ass cake, all right?</i> I want healthy portions for everybody. Marble, chocolate, I don't care. - Are you done? - Yeah, for now. 'Cause I think I made my point. Good. Because captain Cali and I operate a little bit differently. You see, I'm not a DJ. I don't take requests. And your demands mean nothing to me. If I wanna give you something,</i> it'll be on my terms, and now I want you to send Ashley Beck out the front door. If you don't, all negotiations stop immediately. I'm going to take away your food</i> and everything else that makes you comfortable. Are we clear on this? Did I say no meringue? If I didn't, I don't want come. If I see meringue, I'm sending it back to the baker.</i> That was bitchy. What was that? I was taking his blue chip away. Getting the powe... You just flagged his blue chip. You think he's gonna send Ashley Beck? If he wants a cake, - give him a cake! - Captain Cali, under no circumstances does the FBI negotiate with terrorists. You never negotiate? Then why are we here? Can I talk to you, please? You know, I was really trying to avoid the whole obvious butting of heads thing but for all intensive purposes, your job here is done, and regardless of what you think of me, I know men like Mendez. He thrives in climatic situations. You take away his power, you highlight his weaknesses. That's what you do. You didn't do that. In fact, you did the opposite of that. I didn't campaign for this job. I was requested. So let me do what I do, cause I am very good at it. We done? Actually we're not. First of all, there's nothing intensive about a purpose. I also think you meant to say "climactic," unless of course, you think Mr. Wolf thrives in meteorological situations, in which case, "climatic" would be an appropriate choice of words. And this is what you care about, my grammar? I'm talking about the fact that I am not buying your bullshit. So now, for all intents and purposes, we're done. Tonray said the communication block is fine. Good. But that... - That is not good. - No. Tonray. Get me a pack of cigarettes and a lighter, please. - I wanna talk to Teddy Sabian. - Why? We can't communicate with Wolf, but we can continue to work him. Something's up with Sabian. I wanna find out what it is. When Ashley was a little girl, she used to come and jump on the bed until Nancy and I woke up. I must have told her 100 times to be careful. You'd think she'd listen to me. So she ran in one day, and she starts jumping on the bed as usual. The ceiling fan catches her right in the back of the head. I mean, she was all right, she just got a couple of stitches, that's all. Couple of days go by, she comes back into the room again, she jumps up on the bed and she says to me, "Daddy... "You'd better take that ceiling fan down." That's my daughter. Derz, Stan, we're in. What's your 20? Just wrapping up down here. How's that new office space? Safe and sound, baby. We have a very nice view. And if she stays in there too long, she's gonna try something. I want you to get me clearance into command. I want to get in there first hand, and see how the FBI is playing this thing. Okay. But, Alan... I think it's time we took matters into our own hands. Let's handle it how we know how. Okay. Do it. I can't believe we got taken off the perimeter. We gotta talk to Lou. We gotta get back into the pit. The only interesting thing to do with this post is scratch my rocks. There's nothing more satisfying than isolating that itch between your fingers and just giving it the old pinch and roll. That's dangerous. I drew blood once using that technique. Gotta try the "flip and drag" sometime. Utilize the back of the nail. Gently brush the back. This won't take long, Mr. Sabian. We forgot to cross a few t's, dot some "i"s. Where are we? I mean, what are we doing up here? This is where I like to come, clear my head. Where I sit with my thoughts. Try to figure out how I'm gonna get your son out of that bank down there. You know what I need from you in order to accomplish that. I need you to trust me, Teddy. It's not an easy thing, trust. It's one of those... intangibles in life that so often betrays us. I won't betray your trust, Teddy. I'm gonna get your son out of that bank safely. I don't give my word often. But I'm giving it to you now. All I need is for you to trust me. Connie. I've asked Tonray twice now for intel updates. He's falling way behind. Could you please deliver this message to him? You can come this way. You know you make me nervous when you do that thing with your face. What was that about? Alan Beck. Despite everything that's going on, he takes the time to shake every hand in this building, except for one: Teddy Sabian, that's right, why? I'll tell you why. Cause that little farce of an introduction, that wasn't their first meeting. What are they doing? What are they doing? Loudspeakers, Cap. FBI ordered them. That wasn't my call. You may wanna go over there, talk to Ash about it. I'm gonna do just that. Excuse me. What's with the sound system? It's becoming very time-consuming having to explain myself to the consultant. - Careful, Cali. - I'm being careful, sir, just curious. So what? You're gonna make some noise? That's your plan to save lives? Mr. Beck, you may wanna pay attention, you've a lot at stake here. - Cali, I gave you fair warning. - Duly noted, sir. Yes, we're gonna make some noise, Captain. I also ordered the A/C to be up, it's gonna be 30 degrees in that bank. Psychological warfare, heard of it? They spent winters in Fallujah with bombs going off as they slept. That's noise. That's cold. What do you think? Than playing music over a stereo system and turn on a fan is gonna break these guys down? - That's it? Try country music. - We need to talk. Cause that's enough to make me wanna blow my brain over the sidewalk. - What?! - Stop talking for once, and listen. You said it, bureaucratic bullshit's why you're in this spot. Well, this bullshit may be more dangerous than them HTs. But you want them hostages out? You need to swallow your pride - and play this one straight. - Okay. Don't even come back at me. You are not in a position to buck the system right now, because it is bucking you back. Now, come on. Okay. Leroy. It's time to talk. - About what? - Your gun. If we can get the one you stashed, and then get our hands on his gun, we got this side of the bank covered. How're you gonna get it? I've worked the electrical in the bank this week. There's a spot in the men's bathroom that I can get to. Send this place in the black for as long as we need. Okay, so... We got this side covered. But what about over there? We hire the rich kid. She can get piggy under her thumb. Hopefully she's telepathic. I got the way to communicate with her. How did they get your dad's email? Is he gonna get you out? They're not gonna let me go. Relax. Are you ladies talking about me? And what if we were, Mister Pig? I don't know. Mister Piggy, do me a favor. Get the manager guy. Bring him over here to the thermostat on the double, thank you. Come on, come on. FBI broad must have jacked up the A/C in here. - Any response yet? - No, nothing yet, man. What do you think's going on? - How we send a message? - You wanna - write one? - Yeah. Can you set it up? Go ahead. It's up as high as it'll go. The compressor's up on the... Do I want a conversation with you? Just fix it. Come on. It's your bank, Lou. Jesus, what is wrong with you? Hey mister Wolf, you don't have to fight the cops about my cake, dude. - You've enough on your plate, man. - Hey, man. If I say I'm gonna make something happen, I make it happen, all right? - Let's just see if... - Sarge? I gotta ask you, what is it with this cake thing? - I got my reasons, man. - But sergeant, we shouldn't be playing - with the FBI... - I know what I'm doing, man. What are you gonna question me for? - Where's Ashley Beck, sergeant? - What? Candy, I can't hear you. I'm in this freakin' club. Hey, look. I'm looking for a post-op tranny.</i> The bigger, the better, baby. I'm looking</i> for soft in the south, and chiseled on top, okay? Square jaw, adam's apple is all good, baby. But if I see any sign of a johnny, I ship the whore back to you</i> in a pine box, you got that? - Sergeant, this isn't a game. - Oh, shit. I thought you were Candy, my he-whore merchant, sorry. - Yeah. - Oye, mira papi chulo, I want three pies on the fly, mad fast. You got that? One traditional, one white with asparagus.</i> Yeah, and throw in the clam with the, uh, garlic.</i> I know, I'm gonna get ass flames, but it's good going down, uh? Oh, hey, sorry. Wrong number. Kill the sound. I'll be right back. Where are you going? Our guy is in place. It's on! It's on! He took the bait! Come on, come on. Get up, queen bee, come on. Time to earn your keep. Hold it right there, sweetie pie. - Ashley Beck, sergeant. - Keep your eye on the door. We're coming out. Let's go. All teams ready. Wolf's coming out of the bank. All right, line up and hold. A low show and tell. Breathe easy. Who's this guy? Fellows, we've a problem. Sniper on a rooftop. He's not a cop. This is a pro.</i> Shit. Where? Where is he? 2282, Penn ave. Move. Move!</i> Shit. Sarge is outside the bank. What the hell is this man doing? Run, baby. Come on. Who's firing? They shot me! Run, baby. Run. Please stop! Stop, please! Jesus Christ! They shot me! Please! Please! Come on, boys. Get him. The sniper's... incapacitated. Something funky going on here. They don't give a shit about the rest of us! Another inch and i'm dead. An inch! That was not cool. - We could've been killed. - I'm sorry, come on. I'm not gonna let you get hurt, or let anything happen to you. - I need confirmation on all points. - Who fired? We're gathering that information. But it wasn't my team. It was a couple of blocks deep, and whoever fired used a silencer... Find out who fired. Your incompetence could have cost her life. Are you serious? - I think your point has been made. - I decide it myself. Not on my watch. Why would SWAT do that? Why would they risk these other people? It wasn't SWAT. It was Beck. Respect the man who sees a way out for his daughter, and takes it. - No matter what the repercussions. - Hey, Mister Wolf. I would have done exactly the same thing. You better come see this. We're getting bombarded. I checked my messages. I think it's Beck. - You've got a problem. - Yeah, I realize that. A new problem. Word's out that you've only negotiated for Ashley Beck's release. Where's that information coming from? That's a hell of a lot less important than the fact it's a feature on every live feed right now. I am not taking the shaft for this. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire. Wolf! Don't shoot me. You come bearing gifts now? No gifts. Just the best part of the party. Before we light the candles, you know what I need from you. All right. Hey, henry! Come on, you're going home. Come on, get up, man! I'll see you soon, Rocko. It's been a pleasure being a part of your tribe. The pleasure was mine, my friend. Come on, fellas, let's go. Come on, Henry. How about that, huh, buddy-boy? No meringue, right? - No meringue. - Good, man. And you know what? I'm not talking to that FBI bitch anymore. I'll only talk to you. It's not my call but I'm working on it. You do that. Let's get this man some medical attention! Mister Wolf. I apologize. - That shot wasn't ordered by us. - Just shut up! All right? Shut up! Cause I'm gonna start shooting. If I ever hear your voice on this line again,</i> it's gonna cost people's lives. Pick up this phone again and I put blood on your hands, you got that? I only speak to Cali and Cali alone!</i> Crazy sonofabitch. I knew you wouldn't listen to my ass. How is she taking it? I'm hoping for tears. Let's see if Abrami has the balls to push it through. We've reopened negotiations. You gonna explain this? I did a few months at rikers a couple of years back. We didn't exactly have email in the joint. During lockdown, we used to have to find other ways to communicate. So happy birthday, handsome. How about that? Happy birthday, Robby. All right. That's it, champ. Why would they be singing "happy birthday" out there? It's somebody's birthday, I guess. When's yours? You don't wanna tell me? It's kind of the deal. You know, stay strangers. Bang at work. You know, simple. We've pissed in front of each other. I think it's safe to tell me when you were born. April 25th. June 27th. I'm a big fisher. I love to fish. Freshwater mostly. Bass, trout... It's my favorite pastime. I love it. Usually, my days off, I grab a cooler, pack up some beer, get a good book, or some music, and just head out of the city, clear my head. Anyway... That's me in a nutshell. There... I broke the seal. And this... is your piece. Come on, everybody wants cake. Thank you. So who's birthday did you miss? My son's. Many times. Especially when I was over there. You know they always say good soldiers make bad civilians. He probably missed yours too, right?
