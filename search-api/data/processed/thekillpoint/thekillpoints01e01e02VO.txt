and a staff that I certainly have to pay overtime cause you are... what's the word? Late. That's just one example, Henry. The truth is, I can go on all day. Rocco, please, will you do me a favor and stop with the storytelling and maybe finish up rewiring or whatever you're actually doing up there? Mr. Shelton, this is the exact point I was just making to Henry here. Everyone's so damn pissed off all the time. Look, Rocco, I have got mismatched money counts and a sour stomach, okay? Okay, all's I'm saying is we gotta be careful. Take heed. Tribal lines are being drawn everywhere. - Morning, Mr. Shelton. - Hey, Karen, how are you? - You guys done? - Yeah. Here's my figure, Mr. Shelton. And my count, sir. Oh, they match. Excellent. It's been a long day, take a ten minutes break. Come on, come on. Hey, Bernard. Hi, Abe. Karen. If you've control of the account, then I don't have the information. Everybody get down! Down! Everybody down! - Put the hands up! - Nobody move! Get down! Sit, now! Don't move. Keep the fingers away from there! Keep the fingers away from the button. Don't move your hands. There you go, get on the floor. That's it. Thank you. Stay right there. Mr. Piggy, you forgetting something? I got it. Come on, man. All right... Stay down, just relax. All right, ladies and gentlemen, as you rightfully assumed, this is a bank robbery, okay? All I'm asking you is to sit still and breathe and be silent, okay? The last thing I wanna do is hurt anybody. I implore you not to stand up and dance. 'Cause we don't wanna hurt you! All we want is the money. You can understand that, right? With inflation? That's all we want is the money. I bet you can understand that. Didn't I tell you not to move? Keep your hands down! That's it. That's it, everybody. Don't move! Just follow these simple instructions and we can all walk out of here safe and sound. You got that? Okay. Now, Abe Shelton, please reveal yourself. Abe Shelton. Come on, Abe. Abe-ey, where are you? Come on. Rabbit, can you find him please? Oh, here he is! Keys, now. Come on! Down! Mouse, go! All right, you're doing great. That's it. That's good. The more calm you are, the more calm we stay. You got that? All units, robbery in progress. - Yeah? - Sarge, this scanner's blowing up. Cops are on route. You got about two minutes. Mr. Cat, Mr. Pig. The call's in. Cops're on route. We got a solid two. Don't get excited, we're still in control. You got that? Don't try to be smart, guy, all right? That's it. We're good. Stay calm. It's all... it's all good. Hold it. We gotta go back. Damn it, I dropped my cell. Come on! Did you hear me? Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Mouse, are we good? - Very good, Mr. Wolf! - Come on, move it, man! Move it! Thank you people, for your time and cooperation. Let's never do this again. Come on, fellas. Walk away. Go go go, move! Gun! There's an exit in back! Come on! Go out the back! There's an exit in the back. Fall back! Fall back! Daddy, they're shooting people. - Come on, let's go. - Come on, boss. Scotty. Don't worry. Take it easy. Take it easy. I got you. Secure the doors, somebody! Keys! Who's got the keys? You, give me the keys! Give me those keys! Rabbit, secure the back! Got it. All right, ladies and gentlemen. I'm really sorry, but this is now a hostage situation. Now, I need you to follow orders. I promise you bad things won't happen to you. I can guarantee that. Now, Mr. Piggy's gonna secure you into the center of the room. Please follow. You got that? Go ahead, move! Everybody move! You! Up, over there! Go! Go! Ladies, up! Move! Come on, move it! Don't say a word or I won't hesitate to put a bullet in your brain! Silence is golden! You, up! Come on, get up! Go, go. Get down! Move. Come on, come on. Get your legs in. Get your legs in. Get down. Get down. Get your legs in. We're good, Mr. Wolf! How bad is it? It's okay. It went right through, but the lady, she's bad, man. You need to help her. Just help her. Just help her. Okay? Go help her. It's gonna be fine. - All right? - Yeah. How's she doing? Bullet went right through her airway. She's gonna need a trache. And I'll tourniquet that leg if she makes it. Sarge, I'm gonna need a pen off that desk over there. I'll hold her. Thanks. Support her head. Good work, man. Nothing to it. How's she doing? You don't have to worry anymore. She's stable. Yeah, but she needs a hospital ASAP. Hey, Rabbit, did you secure the back? The best I could, Mr. Wolf. What happens now? I can hear you through the goddamn walls, Aug. You sound like a trumpet filled with mucus. There you go, John Boy. You guys need backup clips, remember. I never heard of adult-onset snoring before, man. Hey, Hawke, you're short a concussion grenade. My father snored, his father snored, I snore. I'm just a late bloomer. What about those little presents you leave us in the bathtub, Hawke, huh? You're shedding like a yeti in the Sahara. I have a spare concussion. Take mine. Tool up! He's right, Hawkeye. It's like we're living with a wookiee. Maybe you should wear a hairnet. - It's only right. - Put your domestic problems aside, SWAT-ties, and saddle up. Let's go. All right, here's the skinny. We got multiple HTs inside. Hostage count unknown. I need these perimeter streets cleared and these buildings evac-ed. They got clear lines of sight and low ballistic winds. I didn't know sniping required personal grooming tools, Q. This here looks like the big one. And I'm the face of the squad. This here's like ancient Rome, and I'm the black Maximus. So I got to look good. Blaximus. - Gluteus Maximus. - All right, enough! Where's my skinny freak Tonray? Hey, I'm here. Yes, I'm here... hi, here. Hey, Hawke. - Go to hell, Tonray. - Calm your nerves, Tonray. Christ, you're making me nervous. All right, look, I need complete communication breakdown. Scare 'em into submission. Nothing but the TV. I only want them to see our army, all right? Where's our advanced op gonna be, Lou? We'll figure it out - when Cap gets here. - How about that donut shop, Lieutenant? Or is that too cliched? - Please. - Excuse me. Please don't put our operations base in a donut shop. I'm the anti-donut cop these days, Cap. - Why is that? - Margie's got me on some Madonna-inspired microbiotic malnutrition diet. And I gotta keep up or the sex stops. I'd swap a titty for a tater tot right about now. - Well, at least you're getting some. - Damn, how long has it been? About a month. She's not even due for another five. You believe that? I can talk a hungry fat man out of a candy shop, but I can't even talk my way into my wife's panties. Send her some flowers. Always works for me. It's gotta work better than sending her chocolates. We got schematics on the bank and all surrounding buildings? Yes, schematics are en route as we speak. And Captain Cali, I just wanna say how nice it's to work with you again. It's a pleasure to be here to assist and support in all ways possible. - What is his name again? - Tonray. I need 2 things from you. Kissing my ass isn't one of 'em. First of all, follow instructions. Second, when you speak to me, speak proper English. Don't sweat it, Tonray. I started a sentence with "But" the other day, and didn't hear the end of it. Rightfully so. One misplaced word can cost lives in what we do. Remember that. How about that place? You up to speed on all of this? For the most part. Multiple perps, bank robbery gone bad. Holed up tightly. And... I assume you are Marcos. A pleasure to meet you. We're gonna be taking over your place. Hey, people, we need to stop being scared and figure out what we're gonna do here. B- be quiet. They told us not to talk. So? I'm not gonna blindly listen to what they say. Screw that. Come on. Abe's right. Let's just sit here. That picky bastard's just looking for an excuse to bust someone up again. Henry? Henry, you okay? Yeah. I'm s-sorry. Hey, man, you okay? Yeah, I'm all right now. I'm just saying, we can't do nothing. I got a kid here. You're scaring him with this talk. Hey, hold on. I agree with the girl. Who knows what they're capable of? We need to think of ways of saving our own asses. Do whatever you want, just keep us out of it. What about her? She's in shock or something. All right, just listen to me, okay? At some point, they're gonna kill one of us to show cops that they're for real, all right? And I'm not waiting for anything like that to happen. I hear one more thing, I'm gonna come over there and start tearing things up! No talking! Man. What the hell did we get ourselves into? - We're screwed. - Yeah, well, I thought we'd be counting our cut right about now, hmm? Not holded up with hostages. But that's the way it shook down. So we're gonna do what we do best. - We're gonna deal with it. - You kidding me? Come on, man. We shot cops, all right? All right, we had a deal. No one gets hurt. - All right, just calm down. - No, look, I just wanna go home. I know, man, I know. But we gotta keep control of the situation, okay? We're in this here now. And we're in this thing together, okay? Unless any one of you doesn't wanna play this through. Just let me know, man. We've been through hell and back together, but if you wanna step outside and call it a day, just let me know. Come on, Sarge. You know us better than that. You saved my life. Our lives. You think I'm gonna walk out of here without you? I don't got anybody else but you. I know I speak for my brother when I say we stay with you. We stay in the trenches with you. - Hell, yeah, he speaks for me, Sarge. - I'm with you. - I'm with you too, Sarge. - Yeah, I know, man. I know. But no matter how hard we try to keep it clean, it might get nasty. - Are you with that? - Yeah, if you're here, I'm here. Right on... I'll buck with you. I'll buck with all you guys till the end. All right, then. I've sacrificed too much to spend any time behind bars. I'm riding with my brothers. Backing down is not in my blood. All right, man, so we go all the way together, no matter what it takes. Big guns are on the scene. All right, this is it, fellas. We gotta secure the perimeter before they do. Cat, Mouse, hit the back room. Seal all doorways in case of a smokeout. I'm gonna set up and look for coordinate fire lines. Mr. Pig, Mr. Rabbit, you're on hostage guard. Collecall computers and phones. We gotta burrow in deep or we're done. Go go go go! On your feet! You heard him. Come on, get up, get up! What you got? You got anything? Go to the back of the line. You, get your belt off. What else you got? You got a phone? Huh? Anything else? Take the pills. What do you have? Phone and the wallet. Throw it down, right there. Anything else? All right, here we go. We're ready. Captain, we're good. It's ringing. Who is this? Captain Horst Cali. And you are? - I'm Wolf. Mr. Wolf. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Wolf. My people tell me you're holed up pretty tightly in there. Blocked every exit, every vent. Impressive. How is everyone? Anyone injured? Yeah, we got one. But she's stabilized. What about you? How you doing? How am I? Just great. This is one goddamn party for me. Yeah, well, I like parties myself, Mr. Wolf. However, I can't say the same for the 50 or so SWAT team members surrounding the bank right now. So what do you say you and I work together to prevent them from crashing the festivities? Hey, let's just put this on pause, okay? 'Cause if you think you're gonna be my friend, or my priest, or my analyst who understands me or gets to know me so you can talk me down, this is all you need to understand, okay? I'm the guy with the hostages. I'm the guy with the gun. I don't want your advice, I don't want your friendship, I don't want any of that, okay? We're business associates. Traders trading commodities. So don't make it personal. You know, I appreciate your candor, Mr. Wolf. So tell me, what exactly do you want from me in our newly established business venture? What do you think I want? I want my freedom, that's what I want. That's a tall order. I don't think I can deliver. Why not? I think it can be really simple. You just got to focus on what's more important for you, huh? Jail time for us or the lives of these people? Okay, Mr. Wolf. We're businessmen, remember? - There's no need to make threats. - No threat to you, man. You're just over there in your little cozy operations base. I was referring to the hostages. As your new business associate, Mr. Wolf, it's only fair that I tell you that the hostages are your only commodity. The less you have, the less trading we can do. It's bad business. Yeah, thanks for the advice.But you know what, sometimes you have to sacrifice your main resources to be taken seriously. You're being taken very seriously, Mr. Wolf. Now, what do you say we kick off our new venture with a transaction? We'll call it an introductory endeavor of good faith. Start with food, drink? And what's the cost? One. What do you say we get that injured hostage out of there? - All right, deal. - Good. Just one thing. My men and I, we've killed before. We know how to do this. We made a pact. We're not gonna go to jail, no matter what. You got that? This thing either ends with us free or dead. Formidable? Oh, if he's improvising he's damn good at it. He thinks fast, as if he's been in siege situations before. Seems logical, though. I can use that. So he is for real? Yeah, unfortunately, I believe everything Mr. Wolf just said. - So? - Let's make the trade. Then we let them sit and sweat. Yeah. - Watch out. Move out. - Move out. Here we go, boss. Found these stashed in a room upstairs. - Rabbit to the rescue. - What do you got? Good work, fellas. Good work. You got two basements? Study these suckers, 'cause I don't know if we're gonna leave through the front or the back. Okay, go ahead. Agent Kerry Southwell, FBI. Son of a bitch, they shot a Federal agent. Good tourniquet on that leg. And that trache... that's battlefield style. What are you thinking? I'm saying, I ain't seen that since Afghanistan. You know, Wolf said things to me on the phone. He used terms. Stabilized, operations base. Military terms. Military terms, military trache. Said he and his men have killed before. Think we got soldiers in there? If we got soldiers in there, this thing could get very complicated. Yo, brass ball. Here we go. Deputy Chief Abrami. What brings you down here? I have to say, Cali, my new job title sounds even more satisfying coming off your lips. Well, I'm glad you like it. Though I think you got me confused. You see, Tonray, he runs the ass kissing department. You got a good one here. So what do you say we get me caught up? Don't look at him, Ashley. My old battered bladder won't last here. You should say something. W- what is she doing? I mean, that's making me very nervous. She's smart. She's angling that Pig. We should all be thinking the same way. Listen, I'm not suggesting that we do something crazy here. But I planted my gun in that flowerpot over there. What are you doing with a gun? I'm a criminal defense lawyer, Abe. Need I say more? Mr. Rabbit. Keep an eye on him. He's having way too much fun. You know what, bring a TV over there. Keep him distracted, all right? Easy, easy, easy. All I'm saying is, obey the house rules. Label your food. Don't scratch your balls, then use the remote. - Flush twice. - Let me amend that. Us two, you three. Sometimes you leave, like, this sand at the bottom of the bowl. It's disgusting. Three, minimum. Okay, this thing's ready. Oh, smile at the birdie, ass lord. Connie, we got eyes inside. Hallway's clean. We can move in stealth through a vent and then move for cover. - Stand by, Hawke. - Too soon to make a move. If we can make entry... we should move in right away. I need to talk to her alone. - Take those two up front. - Come on, let's go. Come on. You're gonna tell the families of the deceased hostages that we made a premature move and we're sorry? We're talking about a tactical action. Getting men inside the perimeter to get us eyes and ears. Well, I don't think Wolf is gonna interpret this move the same way. In fact, I'm pretty sure he'll be ready for it. 'Cause you have some idea these are combat-ready soldiers who would not leave a back hall open. That's right. Well, they have left it open, Captain. And I'm not gonna wait for them to close it again. People who wait often miss golden opportunities. - You ever heard that? - You're making a mistake. I've worked tactics before. You see a hole, punch through it. That's not what I meant. When you said... people who wait often miss golden opportunities, you used a misplaced modifier. Confusing the message recipient, me, about whether I'll miss a golden opportunity if I wait frequently or if I'll miss a golden opportunity the very first time I wait. I'll tell you what. You give me a grammar lesson after I teach you how to save these hostages. It is too soon to make a move! Let me put the screws to these guys, for Christ sakes. I will get one hostage out at a time. Save a life at a time. I will dwindle his currency down to zero. It is my negotiation. Let me talk. It's my department. My rank supercedes your tactical site authority. Fine. I want it on record that this is not my call. Duly noted. Was that the proper English, Professor, or should I have thrown in "ass" in there somewhere? Get your men in position. Let's end this. You... You like all this danger, Ashley, don't you? No. I mean, you only live once, right? - Can't get a second ticket. - No. No, you're damn right you can't. You looking at that? You like my tattoo? Yeah, it's cool. You got any more tattoos? - I got that one. - That's cool. Yeah, that's my favorite one. I bet you have a tattoo somewhere. I got a couple little ones. Come on, I showed you mine. Show me yours. Sarge. Sarge. Come on, don't be shy. Come on, come on. What's going on? My friend Ashley was taken by one of your guys. I'm getting really embarrassed. No! Don't get embarrassed. My shy little self is gonna have to ask you to turn around for a sec. One more second, mister. - He didn't touch me, we were... - I know, sweetie. Don't worry about it. Just relax. Piggy, take her back. Take girly back. Take girly back over there, man. Take her to the other hostages. Get back on patrol. What is this bull? - Look, it ain't what it looks like. - Come on, man. Make contact. We'll distract them while our boys make entry. What can I do for you, Captain? Just checking in. It's been some time. Yeah, well, I'm just sorting through things. Trying to figure out what I need next. That's all. I hear a TV. Watching the show? Yep. Only show in town, right? We got built-in drama. Action. Who knows, you and I, maybe we could be stars after this. Yeah, well, too bad I hate reality shows. You walk out the door of that bank right now, we can cancel the show. Wolf? Breach comin'! Breach! Move it, move it! Delta team, you lost surprise. Retreat! What the hell is going on? Come on! I need backup! Move in! Move! Move! Come on! Rabbit, Mr. Pig, push 'em back! Move move move! Move in. Get down, get down! Move move move! Grenade! Grenade! Go, go! Come on. Delta team, talk to me! Man down. Man down! Zing has been hit. Come on, buddy. Come on, stay with me, bro. Zing! - Come on, Zing! - Medic! God, damn it! Excuse me. This operation is all mine now. You let these pigs know they can't screw with us like that, Sarge. You know, I keep talking to you about this, right? You keep jerking around, you know that? If you'd been patrolling the back hall like you were supposed to, they would have never made entry. That's all I'm telling you. Talk to me, Wolf. Nice distraction, Cap. All right, face to face outside right now. Gimme a vest. It's time to prepare, Johnny Boy. Focus and lock in. Ready your mind. Your eyes make a mark today... but to put it quite simply, will we be making a kill? Lower your weapons and step back, all of you! Step back! What's up, Cap? - Mr. Wolf. - That's right. The breach wasn't my call. Yeah, sure. I was following orders. Yeah, well, following orders sometimes will cost lives. In fact, it just did. Your men took out one of our SWAT team members. T- that's why your army's looking at me like that. I'm a cop killer. I see you up there, snipes. I'm looking at you, SWAT. Uniforms. I know what you're thinking about me, man. Já estive aqui. Já tive armas apontadas para mim muitas vezes. It's not new to me. I know the fear. Go ahead. You wanna shoot me? Go ahead, man, shoot me. Go ahead. Look, I'll give you an easy target, man. Come on. Go ahead, come on. Go ahead, shoot me. Like they did in Fallujah, man Or no, you know what? How about here? How about here, like... Like that shrapnel blast in Baghdad? Go ahead, shoot me. Come on, go ahead. What are you waiting for? 'Cause I love my country, man. I fought for my country and I would die for my country. You think I wanted to end up here? You think I wanted guns in my face again, man? No way!? No freakin' way. But I came home to sickness and nightmares. Even when I close my eyes, you know what I see? I see the faces of the soldiers and civilians that I killed, that's what I see. I spoke to my captain. And he makes me talk to a shrink who doesn't know shit. And then the goddamn government smokes me out with their lies and away goes my pension, away goes my medical. And if my wife gets sick, who's gonna pay for it, huh? Who's gonna pay? I pay! We pay! I served my country, man. I served... 15 years I gave. 15 years. Who's gonna protect me? Who's gonna protect me, huh? Who? So I started this and look where I am, man. Look where I am. Back in the firing line. So maybe you should shoot me. Go ahead. Maybe you should shoot me. I'd rather die than go to jail, that's for damn sure. I- I didn't spill my blood for this country, for freedom, to have it taken away when I came home. I got some demands 'cause they took everything away from me, okay? I want antibiotics, 'cause I got injured in there. And I want a flak jacket for every soldier in Iraq! 'Cause our stupid-ass government doesn't think that they're necessary. And I want the son of every senator who voted yes for this war to sign up for active duty! You get me those things, and I'll leave here. I'll ask for a bus and a chopper, and I'll disappear. You got that? Don't ever breach again, man. You know what's at stake, and I know how to play. Tonray, looks like we're gonna be here for a while, so I need a few things from you We got Wolf's face now, so get in touch with the military. See if we can ID him. Connie! Connie, what are you doing with the donuts? Connie, don't even think about eating the donuts. Don't throw away the goddamn donuts This is bull shit. I saw action, and I ain't robbing banks. Goddamn martyr's turning this into a political cause. - It was a good play, Connie. - Yeah. Stockholm Syndrome. People can empathize with soldiers. Hey, he's just buying time to plan his next move. We have to come up with our own. It has been confirmed to News 14 that after much speculation, Alan Beck is indeed at the scene. Now, we do have a crew standing by with his location. And we are expecting to go live from there in the next few minutes. Excuse me, sir? As we can see, Pittsburgh real estate magnate Alan Beck is indeed at the scene. And we're awaiting confirmation that his daughter Ashley is indeed one of the hostages. Now, born and raised right here in Pittsburgh, Ashley's been the center of much media attention throughout her childhood. But... - ...especially this past year - Here we go. as her college life has become more a point of interest. She just became our most valuable commodity. ...attending Carnegie Mellon, where she is... - in her junior year. - Hey, Mouse, turn the TV off. News 14 has heard some speculation that Ashley... Cat, Piggy, you're gonna be on foot patrol. You're gonna check out schematics. All right, get to it, fellas, come on. Thanks, boss. What's going on? I haven't seen you talk to anybody. Let's get that blood off of you for starters, huh? Just a little wet, okay? That's all. There we go. That's it. You clean up well. Look at that. You know, it looks like I'm in control here, but... actually I'm just... I don't know. I'm just trying not to let bad things... I'm just sorry you saw what you saw. Thank you. There's no way. We stay in here. Here it is, Captain. All right, what do we got? Name, Jake Mendez. Three tours in Iraq Ran his own platoon, the 1013. Spent a lot of time in Fallujah. Patrolled Baghdad and Babylon. Couple of killer "B"s, Captain. Wife died last year. 16-year-old son. Wait. Look at this. Christ. This needs to be read as soon as possible. Tonray, print out multiple copies. Get it to our friends in the press Connie, track down his platoon-mates. Some of them may be inside with him. - Who is this guy, really? - That's what I hope to find out. Tonray, find out if the owner, Marco, has a partner named Marco. Okay, um, but... how do you want me to prioritize that? - Is that important or not? - Is that important or not? Tonray, there are so many things wrong with the construction of that sentence, I can't even stand to look at you right now. Okay, please, just go get it done, now? Thank you. Update on special agent Southwell. She's out of surgery, in critical condition. The FBI is sending a team down to assist us. -And someone is on their way to see you. - That'll have to wait. It's not a request, it's an order. By one of the man's closest friends. The mayor. Alan Beck is coming. My daughter is inside the bank. So the speculation can now stop. I know this from a message she left for me shortly after the siege began. With that said, we're all aware that there are other hostages inside. I would hope that the media would respect that fact and not make this situation all about Ashley. Talk to the man. Buy us time. Words cannot express what my daughter means to me. Thank you very much. That's how he used to say good night to me when I was little. Grabbed my nose, saying that he stole it. I wonder if they let the rest of our families know yet. My goddamn girlfriend probably thinks I'm out bangin' around on her again. Crazy broad. My husband probably figured it out by now. Your families too. - You have a husband? - Robby. Rabbit, come here. We gotta find an alternate exit, all right? It's gonna take some time, so we're gonna roll into combat schedule. Strict patrols, rest on rotation. Just, we gotta manage the fatigue, all right? All right, whose laptop is this? huh? Huh? Come on, people. Whose laptop is this? Come on, people. Talk to me. Whose laptop is this? - It's mine. Mine. - What's your name,Junior? It's Robby. I'm his father. I think it best if you just spoke to me. All right,you know how to work these? All right,you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna separate you guys into two groups,okay? Robby Rob and his dad, Ashley Beck and her little friends into one group. And everybody else is in the other group. Just push 'em to the other side of the bank. Okay,come on,everybody up! Whoa whoa whoa whoa. You and you. You two. You,you,you. The skinnies and the fatties. Get close to me. The rest of you follow me. Why are you separating us like this? You ask another question, and I will shatter every bone in your face. That goes for everybody. Come on, let's go. Hey,Cap,what can I do for you? I just wanted to let you know that the military released your dossier,Sergeant. Oh,yeah? I hope you like fiction. Actually,I do not. So why don't you tell me what really happened? You got my antibiotics? Do you have my hostage? Yep. Okay. Then the medicine's on the way. What about my other demands,huh? I'm not getting out of here until they're met. Now,Mr. Wolf,you and I both know those are gonna take some time. Q, radio in sight. HT coming to the door. All right,come on. Say your good-byes. Get up,get up. Come on,come on. You're going home. Come on. If you are just joining us, we are here in market square. There has been a bank robbery at Three Rivers Trust. The details are sketchy, but we do know there is an unknown number of hostages inside. Those details will become available to us and of course we'll bring them to you. Keep it here to News 14 for more details. Bernard Kuzmicki,an older gay man. He's been a customer of mine for 15 years. Addie's been giving us hostage and HT positions. Firepower. And that the HTs know Ashley Beck is inside. Anything about Wolf? That he's clearly in charge. Calm. She says they're a tight unit. A well-oiled machine. Continue with the hostages,Addie. Okay,Theodore Sabian. Kind of a happy fat man. Longtime customer. And his son Robby. How old would you say the boy is,Addie? 15,16. So he's the youngest hostage? Oh,definitely. Yes,I could say that for sure. Excuse us,Ms. Berman. Excuse me one second. Get the boy out of harm's way. Absolutely. Why'd they break us up like this,huh? They cut off all our communications. No emails,no calls out,no nothing. But there's a bunch of other frequencies out there. If we can get this kid to get us onto an open, unblocked one... money. - Okay, that's it. - What? You'll have to get word to this person. See, that's the new frequency that I just tapped into. And then you can communicate with them. How the hell do you know all this stuff, man? I actually kind of taught myself, so that I could listen to people's cell phone conversations and then get them in trouble if they pissed me off. You're a crazy kid, man. Don't tell them... only speak when spoken to... I can handle myself... You know what, Dad, I am sick and tired of... Hey, guys! Guys, guys. Save the dysfunctional bullshit for the dinner table, all right? It's not appropriate for a hostage siege, please. Sarge, a minute? What's going on? All respect due, but why haven't you asked them for a chopper or a bus? Come on, man. Come on, bro. That never works, man. People don't just drive off to their freedom. Doesn't work like that. We're gonna be so easily tracked. Come on, man, if we wanna get out of here, we have to come up with something that they won't see coming. - You got that? - Yeah. You're on TV, Mr. Wolf. It has been confirmed that Jake Mendez is a military criminal. Court martialed for the deaths of 16 fellow soldiers. The details are still sketchy at this time, but what we can tell you is that he was sentenced to one year in Leavenworth following a plea bargain. He was stripped of his pension and his military benefits. Attempts are being made to contact other members of Mendez's platoon. In hopes that they too can add to the details of what actually occurred over there. How did 16 men lose their lives during this time of service? You did it,Cap. You made sure I didn't become a martyr. Let's forget about that for a moment,shall we? I wanna ask you for a favor,Mr. Wolf. We debriefed the hostage, she told us there's a boy inside. What do you say you send him out? I'd love to,Cap,but I can't. Why is that? Because I really like the kid,that's why. You have a son,Mr. Wolf. I think you can appreciate my request. Let's get the boy out of harm's way. It's not gonna happen,Cap. I'll tell you what, you do me a favor,I'll do you a favor. You want steak and lobster for dinner? You want Direct TV? I'm not interested,Cap. Forget it. I want you to release the boy. Wanting's a lot better than having sometimes. Conversation over. Mr... Kill the electric,now! Nobody move! Hey,Robby,did you link the Blackberry? Couldn't finish linking it. - Why not? - Listen,if we lose the power, we're gonna lose the clear frequency. And if we lose the clear frequency, then you will not be able to contact anyone. Come on,man. Are you trying hard enough? I am trying the best that I can. Come on,don't slack on me,buddy-boy. Come on. If I get the electricity back, you can tap into that frequency? Man,did you see how complicated that was,Sarge? No. No,we need the kid. I need the electricity back. You know the price. Look,I'll give you anybody else except the boy. Anybody. You get power back, when you release Robby Sabian. Look,just take somebody else for the electricity, all right? I want the boy out of danger. Come on,save a life and take somebody else. Give me the child,Mr. Wolf. I'll give youexactly one hour to give me electricity back or I kill a hostage,you got that? what happened to the lights? Shh,I don't know. Just go. I'm not like a boy. I can't just aim my stream,you know? I can't even see the vent. I need a sliver of light. This is insane. There's no sliver. It's gone. Just go or I'm gonna pee in my pants. I haven't pinched the head of my prick to stop the flow of piss since I'm seven. We have to do this,Renee. Stay put,stay quiet. We go out there,they might kill us. I don't know you and I'm gonna pee in front of you? Just do it and get it in the vent. Don't get it on my shoes or my socks. I hate wet socks. Okay,fine,fine. I gotta focus,all right? All right,all right,all right. Oh,my God! Are you hard? Sorry,it's a reflex. You're down there and you're bumped against me. - Are you going? - Shut up! Addie just ID'd the HTs from their military file. All from Wolf's platoon. Wolf,we know him. Brothers Albert and Henry Roman. Both had records from before they went into the military. Assault,burglary,drunk and disorderly. And yet Henry is a decorated soldier. Did three tours. Didn't have to. Another war hero. Great. You really think they're gonna execute a hostage? Just to get their lights back? I don't know. I don't know what he's capable of. That's what I have to figure out. Cali,don't tell me you're thinking of giving in to Wolf. I'm thinking about what I always think about,sir. Saving lives. You know the policy. We do not give in to death threats. You said it yourself, I know the policy. Good,don't make a move without consulting me. Yes,sir. Cap. If Wolf is really gonna kill a hostage, don't you think we should just give him the electricity back? Get another one out? Tonray, if I give in, then I give him the power. I cannot afford to give him the power if it's only a bluff. Otherwise,we'll be here for days. Now,let me ask you a question. Have you spoken to Marco yet? - No. - Would you go take care of that,please? Thank you, good-bye. Why,Connie? Why would Wolf go balls to the wall for the kid? My guess is he thinks we won't breach if he has a child inside. That'soo easy. Well,I have no idea. I understand. Look... let's get some intel on Robby Sabian. Just in case it's something else. Yeah. Deputy Chief. Beck's arrived. Christ,Sarge,did you really say that? I got no choice,man. You said we weren't gonna kill anyone. Right,but we need electricity. Sarge,do u think you really put one of these people down? I'm not going back to jail,man. Neither are you guys,okay? It'd be our end. This is a numbers game. It's just our five lives or one of theirs. That's all. Do you think they'd really call your bluff and not turn the electricity on? Yeah,if it feels like it's an empty threat,yeah. But I'll do my damnedest to make sure he feels it's full. All right,any more questions? It's like Survivor. Someone's getting run off today. Do you think they'd really kill one of us? I don't think so. It's probably just a bluff. Don't pretend you know them,all right? I'm not. They've been pretty cool to me,Dad. Yeah,they've been pretty cool to you because they need you,okay? These are not cool guys,Robby. These are bank robbers. Real observant of you,Dad. Thanks for pointing that out. Cut the tone. I will not stand for... Hey. I won't! Hey,listen. We have to get word to the other group, okay? They couldn't hear Wolf. And it's less than an hour till time's up. They should know. What are you doing? Excuse me? How about a bathroom break? What is it? Leroy,what does it say? Captain Cali,thank you for seeing me. I'll get right to the point. My daughter's a little bit like me. She's not gonna wait to be rescued. My fear is that she may try something that will get her or someone else inside there injured. Mm-hmm. I would appreciate it if you would get her out before she does something stupid. Removing Ashley from that bank will benefit everyone inside. I understand. I'll do my best to get everyone out safely. Thank you. Appreciation is an interesting thing, Captain. Many people would say it's a very good thing to be on the receiving end of my appreciation. Now,can we talk or not? I thought we were. Talk like gentlemen. Why don't we cut the cipher-like jargon? Everybody in that bank is of equal value. Not every life is of equal value,Captain. It's naive of you to think so. I went through the rest of his military file. The incident that caused his court martial, Wolf disobeyed a direct order. Refusing to send his platoon into a hot zone. Another platoon was sent in which resulted in casualties. That's not the crime I was expecting. Nope. He's got several instances of alcohol abuse. And a long paper trail about his mental state. You speak to the men in his platoon? Can't find half of them. The ones I did speak to wouldn't say much. - Blue code of silence. - Camouflage code of silence. Let's try and talk the war hero down. All right, Cap. Ready to turn my lights on and give me the power back? Not yet. I want to talk to you about reconsidering your demands. What do you wanna talk about? You wanna talk about killing? Is that what you wanna talk about, huh? 'Cause, you know, I'm guessing you probably know diddly-squat about that. You'd be guessing wrong, Mr. Wolf. Oh, yeah. Oh, right, 'cause you've taken somebody's life, right? I didn't take someone's life. I defended my own. Yeah, well, killing's killing, Cap. Especially from the corpse's point of view. What you're talking about doing is not defense. You'd be killing without provocation, Mr. Wolf. You're the one who's provoking me. Because you took something I need for survival, and I'm just defending that. You have no idea what my men and I have been through over there and you have no idea what we're capable of either. You're a soldier, Sergeant. You're trained to protect American citizens, not kill them. Don't play that with me, okay? I'm beyond that. You know what I learned when I came home? I learned that life's one big, shit-eating war. That's what I learned. And in this war of attrition, I'm a soldier of misfortune till the very end. You kill a hostage, negotiations are over. No, that's when negotiations begin, Cap. Ciao. - Hey! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sarge. Sarge, it's me. Shit, I gotta deal with friendly fire here too? All right, look, we only have 22 minutes left. Which one, Mikey? Which one? - What? - Help me. How do I choose, man? Do I take the one with the life that's worth the least? The one with no potential? The one with no family? The oldest one? How do I choose, man? Help me. What do you make of that? Let's go visit Connie. Look at Wolf. Did you see him? Deciding which one of us it's gonna be. Maybe we should make a run for it. - I'd rather go down making a break. - No, we should stay put. - I think we're gonna be okay. - Oh, you do? Oh, well, that's fantastic. And it's really reassuring. My heart just stopped racing and suddenly my stomach feels great. Just great. - Hey, what about my gun? - No. We make that move now, we're done. He's killed 16 people. You heard the television, right? The guy's a killer. He's a murderer. You keep talking this doom, I'm gonna knock you out cold. I gotta make it through this. I got little boys at home. But me, I don't have a family, do I? I'm just a sad, lonely 45-year-old with no ties to anyone. My death will have repercussions for no one. Right? I mean, no one, of course, but me. God, I feel nauseous. It's the candle that's making you sick. I believe their candle's a soothing coconut ginger honey. I would have preferred that as my death scent. It's not the candle. Christ, Bernard, death is staring us in the face. I'm trying to get my mind off of something that I have no control over, Mr. Shelton Don't let your fear own you. Que sera sera. We should breach, Connie. They are clearly about to execute somebody. This proves it. Hawke, you better calm down. Cap, you need to see this. Hawke found this by the hatch in the basement. The bathroom's right by that door. Have them dust it for fingerprints. You find out if Tonray's spoken to Marco? I vaguely remember when taking a long-held piss was tantamount to a goddamn orgasm. These stones are making a mess of my urethra. Captain Horst Cali. Fired his weapon seven times in three years before he went to New York. Did his negotiator traing there. It's the best program in the country. There is one option here. We can see if the man just does the right thing. He has a no-casualty rate for 13 straight negotiations. We just find somebody comparable, that's all. I'm just not confortable dealing with somebody who's not interested in listening to me. Especially when my daughter's life is in the balance. I made the phone calls, Alan. The FBI's putting through a unit for secondary position. They have something at stake here, because their agent was shot. I'd be a lot more comfortable if they were involved. We were on the mend, Jim, She was giving me a second chance. If somebody takes that chance away from me... Get on the phone. Sarge. Sarge. I want you to know that what needs to get done shortly, we don't have a problem doing it. We're not saying that you do, but me and Henry know our roles in this thing. We're the assassins. We do what it takes to get us out of here. If it comes down to zero hour, and he still hasn't given us electricity, we'll do the deed. You sure you're up to it? We're up to it. Yeah, what's up, Cap? I'll be right there. Sounds like he's ready to compromise. Hope you're not wasting my time, Cap Came to give you some information about some of the hostages. Perhaps you'll find it useful. Bernard Kuzmicki, he has a heart condition. Found that out from his sister Carol. Henry Clement's father, he's out of surgery, recovering nicely. Leroy Barnes, his wife called, told us he has an ulcer. She also said his two little boys are very worried about him. She said not to worry. She told the boys Leroy's working late. All right, don't contact me again unless you're ready to give me back my power. You got that? And you got 12 minutes or bad and bloody things are gonna happen. What'd he say? Did he blink? Captain! Captain, I finally got in touch with the warden at Leavenworth. Turns out Wolf had a breakdown in prison. He suffered from post traumatic stress syndrome. Other than that, his prison file is pretty clean. What about Marco? Oh, yeah, Marco. He doesn't have a cousin Marco. Or a friend. He wants to know why you're asking. No, you wanna know why I'm asking. Get me a can of spray paint. No questions asked! - Spray paint? - Go! What the hell are you doing? We got eight minutes, Cap. The clock is ticking. And he ain't showing no signs of breaking. Six minutes left. And Wolf is eyeing me. Just my luck. Great, this'll be the first lottery I ever win. - Please be quiet over there. - Calm down, Mr. Shelton. We're the bad group. They're pulling the people they're going to kill from this group. Forgive me, I've got to do this. Mr. Rabbit, I need to speak to Mr. Wolf now. Sit down! Please, I just need to speak to Mr. Wolf. - Mr. Wolf! Mr. Wolf! - Sit down. Please just let me talk, Mr. Rabbit. Please... Please I need to speak to... Oh! Jesus! Mr. Wolf! Please, I think I should be the one who's spared here. I know things about the bank that could help you! - Please, Mr. Wolf! - What's the problem, brother? Nothing! He's freaking out! I got him. Hey! Hey! Let me out! Please let me out! - Please let me out! Help me! - Leave him alone! I gotta get out of here! Down! Get down! No! Down! Get down! - I gotta get out of here! Please! - Get down. Down! - All right, Mr. Shelton. Calm down. - No, please. Don't kill me, Mr Wolf! You need me, Mr. Wolf. You need me. I need you, I do. I need you to calm down. Are you calm? Do not move. You need me. Mr. Wolf. I'm the logical choice. If it comes to it, choose me. Two minutes before the hour's up, Cap. What's your play? One minute, Cap. 45 seconds. What is your move? Excuse me. Excuse me. Here. Note the apostrophe at the end of Marcos'. After the S apostrophe is the most commonly used to form possessive plurals of nouns. As was the intention with Marcos'. However, there is only one Marco. There's no Uncle Marco, cousin Marco, or friend Marco. It's a singular. Therefore, the apostrophe... should come before the goddamned "S!" As such. Mr. Bernard, you can stand up, Mr. Bernard. Mr. Bernard, please stand up. It's okay. It's okay, man. Go sit down. It's gonna be all right, man. Bernard... where did you find the strength for that? I came out of the closet in '53, Mr. Shelton. One hostage. Now. That's right. A deal's a deal, man. He's got control now, Cap. I saved another life. That's what counts. You. You, Mr. Sabian. - What? I didn't do anything. - I know. You're going home. I told you specifically not to make any moves without consulting me. You weren't here. I didn't have time to seek advice. Yeah? Well, guess what? The powers that be are now fully aware that you folded to a death threat. Convincing everyone this is going to drag out indefinitely. The commissioner wants a full report of your exchanges with Wolf. Fine. Congratulations, Cali. You just all shit over your own dinner. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying with my son. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying with my son. But you gotta go. - It's gotta be you. I'm sorry, - Why? Take anyone else, please. You need my son. - Dad. - You need him. - I'm gonna tell! - No, you're not gonna tell anybody! Mr. Sabian. Mr. Sabian! It's all right. Movement. Someone's coming out. I ask for a boy, I get a middle-aged fat man. Negotiator did not request Ashley's release. Why would Wolf release you, Mr. Sabian? Why not your son? I have no idea. He was adamant about not releasing your boy. You have no idea why? I believe he thinks that... holding Robby will keep you guys from storming the bank. I don't know. I don't know. Excuse me. Finish debriefing Mr. Sabian. - Yeah. - I'll see what this is about. Sir? Is this the FBI backup team? Special Agent Kerry Southwell. She died a couple of hours ago. Brass is furious. They're bringing someone in from Washington who should be here shortly. As of now, you're secondary negotiator. - Secondary negotiator? - That's right. I just got another hostage out alive. Doesn't matter. Everyone inside that bank is now in more danger because of you. Why, because I disobeyed an order? You're not untouchable because of your high success rate. My perfect success rate. Please tell me this has nothing to do - with Alan Beck's influence. - Piss off the right people, - politics prevail. - I'm not a politician, - I'm a negotiator. - You're a secondary negotiator. In consultant capacity. Connie's team will remain primary. Answering to the FBI. News 14 has learned that the FBI agent wounded during the shootout today at Three Rivers Trust has died at Mercy Hospital. Two people dead at our hands now. How does this change things? Well, the FBI's gonna get involved. Just gonna have a lot less time than I thought. Mr. Wolf? - It's all set. - You did it. Everything's ready to go. The Blackberry is on an unblocked frequency now You just have to wait for the other guy to switch to the new frequency. And then you can talk to him. Right now, we can email him if you want to. Good work, man. Good work. You gotta know that I had no choice about your dad, all right? You just gotta understand that for me. And also know that your dad begged me to send you out. Just rember that. You know that note you wrote for me? I didn't have to kill the old man because the cops believed I was gonna do it. Were you? Were you really gonna kill him? I don't feel anything when I take a human life. Nothing. What kind of man doesn't feel anything? You tell me. Bernard Kuzmicki? Look, sir. You feel any chest pains, you gotta tell me, okay? Talk to me, all right? And Leroy, your ulcer starts acting up, man, speak up, bro. All right? Henry. I got good news for you, man. Your dad's out of surgery and he's feeling fine. He's great. All right? Anybody else got any ailments or problems, come to me. Got it? Hey, baby. I know. I'm sorry to wake you. I just... I just wanted to hear your voice. How you feeling? Any kicking? No, no. I just wanted to say hi to both of you. Mr. Sabian. Mr. Sabian, I'm Alan Beck. Can you tell me how my daughter is? She's fine. They haven't hurt her. Thank you, Mr. Sabian. Now, what is it you need to tell me? Mr. Wolf has a message for you. Your daughter gave Mr. Wolf your email address and your cell number. And if you follow these instructions, Mr. Wolf will get in touch with you. If you don't, and one of us goes to the police, then your daughter and my son will not make it out of the bank alive. What a handsome bunch of bastards. Platoon 1013 back in action. Thanks for coming so quick. Hey, Sarge needs us. Let's get our boys home. Next on The Kill Point... - I like watching you sleep. - You say that to all the girls? If she stays in there too long, she's gonna try something. - This is Agent Ashe with the FBI. - FBI. I think it's time we took matters into our own hands. Your job here is done. It's called psychological warfare. They spent winters in Fallujah with bombs going off as they slept. Keep your eye on the door. We're coming out. All teams ready. Wolf's coming out of the bank.
