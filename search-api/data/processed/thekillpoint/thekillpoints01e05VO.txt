and we can all walk out of here safe and sound. Fall back! This is now a hostage situation. Who is this? - Captain Horst Cali. - I'm wolf. Alan Beck is indeed at the scene and his daughter Ashley is one of the hostages. - One hour, or I kill a hostage. - Follow these instructions. If you don't, your daughter and my son will not make it out of the bank alive. - What did you do, Teddy? - I gave these frequency codes to Beck. Finance our exit, and you'll see your daughter's face again,</i> without a hole in it. I think it's time we took matters into our own hands. - We're coming out. - Sniper on a roof. I'm gonna put blood on your hands. - That girl was an acceptable casualty. - Know your place, corporal. - I want two. - You get two because I say so. Augie, I got him, i got him! Don't do it, man. You broke my heart, son. If we can get the gun you stashed, we've got this side of the bank covered. - What about over there? - We hire the rich kid. That's morse. You see what it's saying? It's 1013. Deacon's out there. Guys, I found a way to get our boys out. Hey, Johnny... Is a bullet a bullet when it sits idle in the chamber? Or is it only a bullet upon discharge? I mean, like, is a sniper only a sniper when he puts down his prey? What if the one shot don't happen here today? What's gonna happen to me? What about me? Who am I? Right there. Entry point. Why can't we tunnel through the bank? Banks are tunnel-proof. Steel foundations. But this shitbox here doesn't have that. But it's most likely covered from the inside. That's the problem, Leon. That's why we need the Sarge's help. We can't send a long message via beacon, it'll be noticed. Of course not. Here's what we need to do. - Leon, you're on scrounger patrol. - All right. Got it? Now, once you got all the equipment, Derz, Stan, - you become our tunnel kings. - Cool. Meantime, I need to find a way to contact Sarge, talk to him, otherwise, this ain't gonna happen. He's completely cut off, D. How the hell you gonna do that? A thank you would be nice. Man, I protected your freedom. The least you can do is say thank you. Thank you. Take off your pants. Put your face on the floor. Why are you doing this to me? Do it. You're on a 15-hour patrol. Your feet would blister until your entire heel peels off, man. Then sniper shots would ring out from a mile deep and take down three of your brothers. You... run, and leave 'em, because... well, because you're scared. Every second of every day. You're always scared. If you knew a tenth of the fear, man... you'd have offered me a genuine thank you. Get up. Go. Episode 1x05 Transcript: swsub.com / Sync: DarKsh Whoa, what surprise? What surprise? No, no, no, honey, I do not like surprises, okay? No surprises. All right. Okay, bye, sweetie. Tonray's checked all the frequencies. Wolf's completely cut off. Good. He lost Beck. Now he lost communication. What's the move? Now we make him lose hope. How'd Lucy say you looked on TV? Lucy said that I looked like a cool asshole. - Sounds about right. - I'll take it. Come on. You know, you never cease to surprise me, Mr. Wolf.</i> - Oh, yeah, why is that, Cap? - The stunt you pulled with Alan Beck. That was very impressive. - You've certainly kept me on my toes. - Kept? Why the past tense, Cap? Past tense because it is over, Wolf. It's time to surrender. Now.</i> I think you're misunderstanding something about my plan. I'm doing this for my men. - You really expect me to believe that? - I don't care what you believe. I'm staying inside. I'm not leaving here till my demands are met. You got that? Well, I think we're done talking now? Have a nice night. What was that? Was that bullshit? Maybe it was, but apparently he believes it. Tonray, get over here. Tonray, swear on your life that our communication block is still up. Not one open frequency. He's not talking to anyone. I swear on my life. There is a chance, however, that he spoke to someone else before we discovered what he was up to. Unlikely. Someone else should have the codes... Well, what if Beck did pass the codes on to somebody else? It's time to shift our focus. What do we do? Okay... If he's spoken to someone else, then we need to stop looking inside the bank, find out who it was by looking outside the bank. We're making our move today. We gotta get word to Ashley. We can't do this without her. What's he want? Are you stupid? Just look at you. These guys are trained soldiers. The plan's never gonna work. You're gonna get us all killed. The longer we wait, the better the chance something goes wrong. Trust me. We gotta go soon. Yeah. I'm ready. - What's the message, Sarge? - Hold right. I'm working on a plan. He's probably got, like, Derz and Big Stan with him. 10-13 back in action, right? - What you think he's doing? - Setting up an extraction squad. Stay sharp and keep an eye on the signal. Cap, there's someone here to see you. I told him you were busy, but he just wouldn't take no for an answer. Mr. Sabian, you here with another revelation? Hey, that's not fair. I'm here because my son isn't free yet. I'm sorry, Mr. Sabian. We're doing what we can to get your boy out of the bank. You know, I buried my wife ten years ago. And for ten years, it's been me and my son. And these last nights... these last nights've been the only ones that we've been away from each other. What I'm trying to say is I'm not me without him. I'm just not right. We fight a lot, we bicker. But he's all I got. He's all I got, and if... if... If something happens to him, I don't... know what I'm gonna do. We're doing what we can. - I give you my word. - I trust you, captain. I just don't trust those bastards in there. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. Call our boys. Let's bring in Mr. Wolf's visitor. All right, remember. When we move, you go for their adam's apple, or balls. Throat or scrote. Keep squeezing till the screaming stops. Heads up, Wolf's coming. Cap. - What is it, Tonray? - There's someone here to see you. Who is it, Tonray? It's me, smartass. You ready for your surprise? What is that you're sketching? It's the creepy mes. The creepy mes? What is that? It's a comic I've been working on. See, at the moment every human is born his or her creepy me is born across the globe. And it's pure evil. And it's the creepy me's mission to find the original and to take over his life and do as much evil as possible. Some of our lives have already been taken over. Except... well, except, no one knows it yet. We should get going. - Tonray? - Captain. - Sorry for that. - It's okay. - Here you go. - So... this is my surprise, huh? No, that's not it. It's okay. I could use a shave. I mean, it's been a few days here. And a change of clothes is good. Did you bring one for yourself? - What? - Maybe that and the wig. That black wig is - so beautiful. - Yeah, I know. When you get home. When I get home... Okay. What's wrong? I know I gave you a lot of crap about missing the doctor's appointment, but it wasn't really about that. It was about our future, and what you'd be okay missing when we become three. - Right. - We can talk about that later. And I won't project now. Just right now I want you to see something. Okay. It's a sonogram. Is this our baby? Oh, my goodness. It's so beautiful. It's a boy. Look at his little hands. He's so great. I'm so sorry I didn't make the appointment. I promise you I will never, ever, ever miss another appointment ever as long he's around ever. Be careful. I will. - It's busy in here. - Yeah, it's visiting day. All right, I'll see you. Could you walk her out, please? - Thank you. - Bye, baby. Captain, this is Corporal Leon Halsey. He was a part of Sergeant Mendez's platoon. He'd like to talk to us. Great. Come on in, let's talk. Could you give us any insight into the circumstances surrounding Sergeant Mendez's court-martial? Sarge had an instinct that there was a bomb in the buildings we were ordered to infiltrate. He went head-to-head with every superior. The ballsiest thing I've ever seen. He saved all of our lives. So suffice it to say that his men are fiercely loyal to him because of that. We were loyal before that. They don't have a word for what we are now. So what'd you come here for today, Corporal? - To help, like I said. - Not to help your sergeant? Well, that too. I'm not gonna deny it. But that's a good man in that bank. A good man. You and me aren't robbing banks, and you got a worse deal than he did. You judge him harshly. You don't know his reasons. There are no reasons. He's a disgrace of a man who gives soldiers a bad name. He's a criminal, and you shouldn't defend him. Don't tell me what I should or not do. You don't know what he has sacrificed. That is a good goddamn man in that bank. They're all good men. And I would not be sitting here today - if it wasn't for him. - No need to raise our voices here. I think we all want to accomplish the same thing. And that's to get everyone out of that bank safely, including your sergeant. - Excuse my outburst. - Mine too. Corporal, all we need from you is anything that you can give us that can help us resolve this situation as quickly as possible. Well, just that I don't think Sergeant Mendez really wants to hurt any of those people in there, all right? I know he's doing a bad thing, okay, but he saved all of our lives. And bad things happened to him. Really bad things. That's why he's doing this. That's all I gotta say. I hope I helped. Perhaps it will. If we have any more questions, we'll give you a call. - Thanks. - Thank you. I don't trust him as far as I can spit. Fair enough. We'll have one of our people tail him, keep track his movements. I don't know... I don't know really how to ask this, so I'm just gonna do it. I need a pretty big favor from you. All right. So? What now? I, um... I have sort of... a ritual that I do. A ritual? I like rituals. But I can't leave you here alone... I know. But I-i trust you. I don't know why, and I know that sounds insane, but... I do. And I, um... I thought this might be good for you too. You bored? A little. I have an idea. We could play that game. You know, you go into the vault and take out some stuff. Or better yet... How about you bring me in the vault? - You wanna go in my vault? - Yeah. I gotta get my mind off my dad, you know? You know, no one has to know about our little date. It'll be like a long bathroom break. Cap, he's here. He looks like shit. How's he doing? Shaking off his last high. He expected us a lot sooner. He have anything useful for us? Everything he owns is in that bag. Goddamn heartbreaking, if you ask me. But I think we should use him. May bring Wolf out of that bank. Maybe. It may backfire. Wolf sees his son looking like that, may think he failed as a dad, think he has nothing worth living for. Tell you what: clean him up, keep him close by, we'll see what happens. Yeah. - How'd it go? - I got it done. - Is it working? - Running diagnostics now. We'll know shortly. I'm sorry. I just... When you said he was gone, I thought you meant like he was... - No, I know. - gone. I know, I... just didn't want to get into it, I guess. But then I thought that, uh, since you suffered the same kind of loss, that... maybe it would be okay for us to share like this. So you were married? Yeah, he's... he's an amazing guy. Was an amazing guy. You know, he just always went out of his way. It's overwhelming. But my hope is that, uh, that it gets easier. Oh, it doesn't. You know, I start thinking less and less of my wife. And you would think that'd be better, but... it just makes me feel guilty. Well, I mean, the idea behind this is really, really simple. It's just, uh... It's a way to... remember your loved ones. You know, releasing their energy. All right, yeah. Whatever feels good, right? Go ahead, I'll give you a moment and... No, no, no, I... I'd like you to stay. Please, Captain, just hear me out. All right, hear me out. Mr. Sabian, listen. You can't keep coming down here, okay? I told you we're doing all we can. I know but listen. I gotta get back in the bank. Okay, you trade me for one of the hostages. Or just send me back in, but get me in the bank. That's extremely courageous, Mr. Sabian, but it's an impossibility. You're not going back inside the bank. Why? Please, just... Mr. Sabian, I know this is hard on you. I know that I have been hard on you. If you wanna speak to someone, I'll arrange a psychologist f... I don't need to see a goddamn psychologist, all right? I need my son! I need my son! You don't understand, do you? You don't understand! What? Let's use him. You sure? Wolf thinks he has nothing to lose. Maybe he'll realize he does. He's ready. I'd like to speak outside for a minute. Someone here who wants to see you. You're such a scumbag, you know that? Your boy's been waiting a long time to talk to you. They cleaned you up nice, man. Could've put some long sleeves on you, though. Look, I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to deal with it. This is not the time or place. I just... I don't know. Beggars can't be choosers. - Can't you see they're using? - I'm using them. Yeah, how's that? You and I both know this could be the last time I see you. And I didn't get to say bye to mom, so... I don't know, I... There's nothing I could say which can explain what I'm doing here. You think I expect an explanation? Explanations mean shit. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry about everything. I'm not looking for that. Like I said, I just need to see you one-on-one, face-to-face. I know you're not looking for it, man. Just hear me out, will you? I messed up, big time. I just want you know that I think about you every minute, man. Looks like we got something in common then. Here. You should have this. It's the last picture we took before you left. - Your mother looks... - No, dad, don't... Don't say it. I gotta go. No, wait, hold on. I just... I want to... I want to hug you, son. It's okay, man. It's okay. All right. See you. This is where the bank keeps all the big cash. Unfortunately, me and my brothers took all the money and left in the street. Well, you know that. As you can see we've a lot of safe deposit boxes, many of which I personally inspected, make sure nobody has anything illegal in 'em. What's this? This is a picnic for madame. Snickers and water. - Best I'ld do under the circumstances. - Well, you're very sweet. Nobody's ever called me sweet. Please. Sit. Please. I get the impression you don't... mind this much. Kinda just a break from the bullshit of real life. You know? When I came back from Iraq, I went right back to fixing cars again. You know, like war didn't even happen. I don't even know what the hell we did over there except cause a whole lot of pain. The war was just like a small interruption in my daily life. I changed and... those guys out there, they changed, but nothing... nothing else did. Anyway, I just fell back into my old ways, you know? Just... drinking and doing all kinds of stupid stuff. Just trying to stay numb. Here I am. Here we are. Yeah, I just see this as a break from the bullshit. You're not scared? You know what I'm scared of, Ashley? I'm scared of waking up every day and trying to be a real citizen. Real human being. This is just... This is weird. This is strange, 'cause... since I come back, I, uh... I got problems talking to people, you know. Anybody, really, even my brother. But with you, I don't know, I... I feel like I could really talk to you. You know, uh... We never got to see each other's tattoos. - No. - No. We did not. All right, you know... we can stay here, though, yeah, okay? - Yeah, no, that's... - Okay? Here. Just don't say anything to anybody, okay? All right? All right, let's man up. Time to go home. Mr. Rabbit? I'm sorry. Look, I got the shits. Can I go? I got it. - I'm ready now. - Me too. All right. You really want to stand by while I tear it up? Come on, some privacy. You are so beautiful. Hey, what are you doing? Get in the bank. Get into the bank! Don't you move. What the hell happened? The lights went out in the bank. - What? - Get Wolf on the line, Tonray. - Hold on. - Come on, come on! - Get into the bank. - Ashley, don't. - I'll shoot! - Oh, I'm so stupid! Don't move, don't move. You, out. Put your gun down. Put it down! Don't do this. They're gonna kill you, Ashley. Get into the bank. I swear to God, I'll shoot. I swear. Get into the bank. Come on, Wolf, come on. - Anything? - Nothing. Leroy. Bernard, you good? - I got Rabbit. - I got Cat. All right, that's it. It's over. - Somebody make a move, brother. - Shut up! Everybody, calm down. I can't believe they pulled it off. I mean, this is it. Jesus christ, this is it! Open the door. Unlock it. All right, all right. Do something. - Look at her, she can't shoot. - Shut the hell up. Grab her gun, she's not gonna shoot. Come on, just take the gun. - Get the gun, man! - Shoot him! Don't move. Just take the gun and shoot her. Take the gun, man! What are you waiting for? Don't let him take that gun! Don't move! Come on, just take the gun. Don't move. Please, please. Take her gun, man. Take it! Get away from the door! Or I shoot her. Get away from the door, or she's dead. You, I'll kill the kid. Put the gun down. Put it down! You like that, uh? You like that, little piece of shit! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Come on, come on. Relax, Cap. Just relax, all right?</i> Just a little problem with the wiring. What problem? What wiring? - <i>Talk to me.</i> - Talk? What am I gonna talk to you about, man? After what you pulled with my son, I expected a lot more from you. You are very lucky people. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't wanna hear shit from you. Robby rob, come on. Come on, buddy, let's go. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Just go sit over there on the couch. Cat, you all right? I'll be fine. Mr. Wolf! Let me in! Mr. Wolf, let me in! Why the hell did the lights go out? Guys, I think you should see this. What the hell is he doing? Mr. Wolf! Mr. Wolf, let me in. Please, let my son go or let me in. My son! Let him out, Mr. Wolf! Please! Please, Mr. Wolf! My son's in there. - Mr. Sabian, you got to calm down. - Put me in jail, I don't care. I gotta get in there. Cap, we got movement. Someone's coming out. Stay here. It's the boy. Go get your son. Thanks for coming to get me. But the bug on the photograph has to be within 3 feet for us to hear things. So what? So keep listening, every second. - Cap? - Yes. - Leon. - What about him? He kept saying "them", "they" and "they're." You know when he was going on - about Mendez being a good guy? - Yes. He said, "They're all good guys." like he knew everyone in there was from the 1013. We never released that to the press. No, we didn't. Maybe Wolf was communicating with him before we cut it off. Told him to come and talk shit, buy him - some time. - Son of a bitch. Let's bring back Leon. Can't. He's gone. Son of a bitch knew he was being followed. - Put out an APB on Leon. - Okay. As we saw moments ago, the young boy, Robby Sabian, has finally been released.</i> He's been reunited with his father, whom we saw emerge from the bank almost 36 hours ago. And as we're all aware,</i> there are still several hostages trapped inside</i> with family members still awaiting their safe release.</i> At the appropriate time... Who the hell is that? Holy shit, it's Deke, man. Yo, Deke. - How you doin'? - How did you break through? - They block communications all over. - <i>Not anymore.</i> Sent Leon into the enemy's war room with a scrambler, Sarge. Little device blocks frequencies, com signals. I can only use it in shot intervals though, so the P.P.D. doesn't flag it. I love it, man, I love it. Bro, it's good to hear your voice. Hey, I got the boys here, Sarge. Derz, Big Stan, Leon, like I said. - Say hello, boys. - Yo, Sarge! He's got everybody with him. - Go ahead.
