A tear in the veil between this world and the Underworld. The Keeper is waging war on the Land of the Living. He's using the rift to send creatures into our world. And the only way to close this rift is for us to find the Stone of Tears. This prophecy means that if you continue searching for the Stone of Tears you will find it. But you will give it to the Keeper. I don't believe in prophecies. Sister Nicci, bring me the Stone of Tears. From now on, I serve only myself. (Cara) The Seeker could use a fighter as strong as you, Dahlia. We could serve him together. (Kahlan) Do you think we can trust her? (Dahlia) I wish there were another way. (Rahl) Your sisters and I have missed you. ( Agiel whining ) Aah! (Zedd) Cara attacked me. She took the stone. It's good to have you back. There has to be a way of undoing whatever it was Rahl did to her. There is one way but the results are unpredictable. It's called the Spell of Undoing. ( chanting in ancient tongue ) You are now joined as husband and wife. (Zedd) The spell seems to have changed everything. (Richard) It's a new day in D'Hara, Zedd. I have the power of Orden. (Kahlan) So Richard has been able to use his power wisely. Where's Cara? Who's Cara? (Richard) Sounds like she has a better life in this world than she did in the other one. (Keeper) Victory has been stolen from my grasp. The time has come for you to serve me. (Marianna) Once we have acquired the boxes, we will be able to deliver the Keeper a great victory. If Richard no longer has the power of Orden, then the Mord-Sith and Darken Rahl are no longer under his control. Kneel before me. (Zedd) Rahl has the power of Orden. (Kahlan) He's controlling Richard. I can try to reverse this spell. Do you really wanna go back to an existence where the dead walk among the living? The Keeper is on the brink of victory. (Zedd) I wish there was another way, but there isn't. ( grunts ) (Zedd) Dahlia. She's dead. â™ª Legend of the Seeker 2x22 â™ª Tears Original Air Date on May 22, 2010 (Dahlia) Lord Rahl wants you alive. But if you resist, he'll settle for dead. ( <i>tense theme playing</i> ) -- Sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> -- -- for <font color=#00FFFF>www.addic7ed.com</font> -- ( all scream ) ( <i>action theme playing</i> ) ( coughs ) Kahlan, don't! If I confess her, I can command her to give Cara the Breath of Life, and then you can perform the spell. I'm going to perform the spell on Dahlia instead. Why? Because it should have the same effect on her that it did on Cara. It'll undo all the Mord-Sith magic that was ever done to her. And if Dahlia were never a Mord-Sith, Darken Rahl couldn't have used her to lure Cara away. Zedd, we've seen how unpredictable this magic is. Kahlan, I can't give Cara back the life she had in this world. But if this spell works, I can give her back the life she had with us. A life she was proud of. ( Zedd chanting in ancient tongue ) ( chanting in ancient tongue ) ( thunder rumbling ) ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) ( chanting in ancient tongue ) ( man yelling ) ( yelling ) ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) ( all grunting ) (Zedd) Cara! Where's Cara? (Cara) I'm right here! Thank the Spirits. I appreciate the concern, Wizard. But it takes more than a few banelings to kill me. That's the Cara I know. Zedd, are you all right? I'm fine. I think. Just tell me where we are. Gilgalar. On the way to the Pillars of Creation. Zedd, what's going on? It's a long story. (Richard) Well, you'd better tell us on the move. We need to find a safe place to set up camp before it gets dark. Are you sure we shouldn't keep going? Kahlan's right. The solstice is the day after tomorrow. We need to get to the Pillars. We'll get there in time. But not if we're so tired that we can't fight off the next horde of banelings that attacks us. ( chuckles ) ( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> ) ( thunder crashes ) ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) Quite a dramatic entrance, Nicci. Even for you. To what do I owe the pleasure? It appears you and I now have something in common: Neither of us serves the Keeper anymore. Hm. Tiresome old creature, isn't he? It's so hard to keep him happy. And you won't be very happy when the Seeker fails, and your former master gets his hands on you again. He's not known for forgiving those who betray him. And the Seeker is not known for failure. Have you forgotten the Prophecy? He will deliver the stone to the Enemy of the Light. If there is one thing I have learned, it is never to wager against my brother. Prophecy or not, he will succeed. Your overconfidence can only mean one thing: you know that Richard already has the stone and where he's taking it. Tell me. Why in all creation would I tell you? I can protect him. But only if you tell me where he's going. And how do I know that you are not still in league with the Keeper? So the great Darken Rahl is just going to wait for his little brother to save the world? Oh, waiting's not so bad, as long as one finds amusing ways to while away the time. Why don't you join me? The water's warm. Not as warm as it's going to be. ( screaming ) Where is the Seeker taking the stone? ( screaming ) The Pillars of Creation! (All) Keeper, hear our prayer. We live only to serve you. Tell us, master, how to deliver the world into darkness. (Marianna) Sisters! Glorious news. One of our order has spotted the Seeker on the plains of Gilgalar, heading north, toward the Alithian Sea. We will travel there and intercept him. And how will we defeat him on our own, without the Keeper's help? We summon him, Marianna, but he does not come. I fear he has grown deaf to our prayers. If the Keeper will not come to us, then one of us must go to him. ( grunts ) ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) ( souls groaning in distance ) Keeper? (Keeper) Why do you and your sisters call to me? The Seeker is heading north to the plains of Gilgalar. If you order your banelings to help us, we can kill him for you. (Keeper) I am finished with entrusting my fate to underlings. Now that I know where the Seeker is, I will stop him myself. How, My Lord? ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) If we can't get across, we may not make it to the Pillars! Run! ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) Kahlan, stop, it's too wide! Catch up with me if you can, but I have to keep going. May the Spirits be with you. ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) (Zedd) The rift extends as far as the eye can see. We can't leave Richard out there on his own. Then we'll just have to go around. (Garen) Nicci will die for this, My Lord. You truly believe you and your sisters are a match for the most powerful sorceress in the known world? She infiltrated this temple under your noses and almost boiled me alive. We will avenge the affront. Revenge is a petty motive, Garen. Kill her we must, yes. But not for vengeance sake. We must kill her to ensure my brother's victory. Because if he fails, the Keeper will torture us all for eternity. You do not believe Nicci intends to protect Richard as she claimed. I believe she intends to use him somehow to serve her own ends, whatever those may be. Since we know where the Seeker is going, we know where Nicci will be. But you cannot defeat her alone. You will join forces with the Seeker and his retinue. My Lord-- You heard me! In this dark hour there is no one we can depend upon more than my fearless brother. ( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> ) ( panting ) ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) ( insects buzzing ) ( door creaks ) ( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> ) ( clattering ) It's all right. I'm not going to hurt you. You're one of them. One of who? Banelings. No, I'm not a baneling. I'm the Seeker. Look, the Sword of Truth. My name is Richard. What's yours? Declan. Declan, I'm going to get you out of here. I can't leave my papa. He's alive? (Declan) They killed him. My mama too. They killed everyone. ( sobbing ) I'm going to take you someplace safe. I'm counting on you to keep this fire going, Declan. It's a tough job, but I think you're up to it. There's enough food and water in here to last you at least three days. I'll be back for you before then. I wanna come with you. Oh, I wish I could take you, but coming with me is much more dangerous than staying here. What if you never come back? ( <i>tender theme playing</i> ) See this? It's the Stone of Tears. I'm bringing it to the Pillars of Creation. Tomorrow, when the sun is at its highest, its light will pass through the stone and repair the veil to the Underworld. When that happens, there'll be no more rifts, no more banelings, and the Keeper will be sealed up where he will never hurt you again. Now, I'm counting on you to keep this fire going. Can you do that for me? ( <i>melancholy theme playing</i> ) ( rumbling in distance ) Whoa. ( whinnies ) It's all right. They couldn't get across this way either. Hyah! ( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> ) ( footsteps approaching ) ( gasps ) ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) Master? ( voice of the Keeper ) Kneel before the Keeper of the Underworld. ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) Master, forgive our confusion. We felt your spirit here, in the World of the Living. We were drawn to you, like ships to a beacon. You will tell no one of my presence in this world. Never, master. But in this mortal flesh you could be hurt or killed. Let us protect you. Why do I need you to protect me when I have the Seeker? I don't understand. I took the body of this boy, who was killed by my banelings, because I knew that Richard Cypher could never turn away from a helpless child. You will kill him and then take the stone. No. The time has come to rely on Prophecy. Soon, the Seeker will hand me the Stone of Tears. Master, I am overjoyed to hear it. But what of the second Prophecy? As long as the Mother Confessor's pure heart beats, you cannot win. Then it will be your task to stop her heart. Gladly, master. Her destination is the same as the Seeker's: the Pillars of Creation. Now go there and lie in wait for her. As you wish, master. ( rocks crumbling ) Declan, I told you, you can't come with me. It's not safe. ( normal voice ) I was scared by myself in the cave. I kept hearing noises. Declan, you're slowing me down. I need to get where I'm going, and I can't have you tagging along. I'm sorry. ( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> ) ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) (Verna) Sister Thea. It's been a long time. Please, don't kill me. Why are you following me? Did the prelate think I would be that easy to assassinate? I'm on your side, Verna, I swear. I've been searching for you for months, all the way from the Old World. Why? To tell you that the Creator has sent a new Prophecy about the Seeker. What does this new Prophecy say? The words themselves, not the prelate's interpretation. "On the eve of the solstice, "in the mask of a child, "will the Keeper walk among us. And by his hand will the Seeker be blindly led." The solstice is tomorrow. That's why I needed to find you. So you could warn the Seeker. I haven't seen Richard since he left the Old World. But I may know a way to help him. I'm not sensing any rifts ahead. I think we may have made it around. Now all we have to do is double back 20 leagues and-- ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) ( horse whinnies ) Wait. If I confess her, we'll have control over her powers. We'd be able to protect Richard from anything. ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) ( screaming ) ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) Command me, mistress. Kill the Mord-Sith. ( chanting in ancient tongue ) I will find her and kill her for you, mistress. Forget her. Where's the Seeker? He jumped across the rift. He's at least a day ahead of us. Then we'll have to hurry, won't we? Hyah! How could she have confessed Kahlan? She must have absorbed enough of Kahlan's han to use it against her. Then if we kill Nicci, Kahlan will be released. We have to catch up to them first. (Verna) The hour of the solstice draws near. What can I do to help, with so little time? Send a message by Journey Book to your brothers in all the provinces. Tell them to search for the Seeker. If they see he is traveling with a child, they will know the Prophecy is true. And they must kill the child. Verna, the brothers of this order have devoted themselves to protecting all life. Prophecies are seldom as clear as this one, Brother Joseph. The Seeker is being deceived by the Keeper in the form of a child. As soon as your brothers find him, they must act without hesitation. But if you are wrong, they will be killing an innocent child. And if I am right, they will be putting an end to the Keeper forever. ( sighs ) The Creator has put a sword in our hands, Joseph. Are we going to lay it down, or raise it in battle? ( <i>majestic theme playing</i> ) Hyah! We'll never catch them on foot. Don't you know some sort of spell to make us move faster? Maybe we don't need a spell. ( horse whinnies ) Maybe we can borrow some horses. Or steal them. (Zedd) Mord-Sith! ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) Lord Rahl has commanded us to join forces with you. Out of the goodness of his hollow heart? Out of an instinct for survival. If the Keeper wins, Lord Rahl will be returned to the Underworld to face eternal suffering at the hands of his former master. Well, thank you for your generous offer. But I have a better idea. We'll just take your horses. Cara. You can't seriously be considering this. If we fight them, we could lose. And they have four more pair of hands that can deflect Nicci's magic. ( sighs ) So who's in charge here? I am. So who's in charge here? You are. Then let's ride. Richard's boots made these tracks, mistress. But they're at least a half a day old. He's been here and gone. That way. Mistress, I know Richard. He's clever. He may have realized you're tracking him and be setting a trap for you. I couldn't bear it if any harm came to you. Stop groveling. The Seeker isn't going to kill me. He's going to serve me. How? He trusts you. Once we've caught up to him, you'll get close enough to confess him. That's why I didn't take all of your han. I will do whatever you wish. But how is the Seeker going to serve you if he's confessed to me? You will order him to give me the Stone of Tears. It has the power to bestow immortality even while the Keeper does me the great favor of destroying all the rest of the pathetic life that inhabits this world. You will order Richard to be my consort, and he and I will start a new race in our image. A people that follow my will and my will alone. Oh. But, mistress, if we don't catch up to Richard in time-- That's why you're gonna help me slow him down. ( Kahlan grunts ) ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) ( chanting in ancient tongue ) ( wind whistling ) Hop down, hop down. ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) ( grunting ) ( groaning ) Richard, are you all right? ( panting ) I'm blind. Does it hurt? I'll be all right. Give me the Stone of Tears. Declan-- You can't get it to the Pillars if you can't see where you're going. I'll take it there for you. You're very brave. But I can't let you take the stone. You've seen how dangerous it is for anyone who has it. How will you make it if you can't see? Well, I know which direction to travel. But I need somebody to be my eyes. ( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> ) (Cara) These tracks are fresh. One horse carrying two riders. If we're lucky, Nicci and Kahlan are still down there. I found some bread and cheese. But you deserve so much better, mistress. (Man) Mother Confessor! The Creator has led me to you. Who are you? I am Brother Edward, of the Cloister of Karan-Rah. I have received a message by Journey Book that the Seeker is in great danger. What kind of danger? There is a new Prophecy, sent by the Creator herself. "On the eve of the solstice, "in the mask of a child, will the Keeper walk among us. And by his hand will the Seeker be blindly led." Mistress, we blinded the Seeker. If he is with the Keeper, then-- then he has no way to defend himself. What are you talking about? Where is the Seeker? ( Edward screams ) If the Keeper walks among the living, we have no time to waste. Yes, mistress. ( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> ) ( grunts ) Mistress! Now! ( coughing ) ( Agiels whining ) ( Nicci screaming ) No! ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) She's in the Con Dar. Command us, mistress. Kill each other. ( Agiels whining ) Mistress! ( both grunting ) (Zedd) Be very careful. If she sees us, she'll confess us. Not if we finish off Nicci first. ( Kahlan grunting ) I will save you, mistress. ( Nicci grunting ) ( panting ) It's too late. Then I will avenge you. (Nicci) Forget revenge. Bring me the stone. If its magic is powerful enough to grant eternal life, it may revive me even after I'm dead. Go. Find the Seeker quickly. Yes, mistress. ( Cara grunts ) She's already dead. Then Kahlan is released from confession? Kahlan, we're here. Uh... Hyah! How is she still in the Con Dar? Maybe because Nicci used Kahlan's own magic to confess her. The only way to free Kahlan is to kill her, then bring her back with the Breath of Life. ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) (Zedd) She was moving too fast. No. I hesitated. Because for some stupid moment, I was worried I couldn't revive her. She was your friend. That's what you people have done to me. Made me weak. No, Cara. Your hesitation wasn't weakness, it was a strength. An instinct to preserve life rather than snuff it out. And without that instinct, what are we fighting for? Hyah! ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) (Declan) It's too narrow. Maybe we can find another way. Just watch your step. You'll be fine. Richard, I'm falling! Give me your hand! Richard!! ( grunting ) Are you all right? My foot's caught! I can't move. Is there another way down? A path, 20 paces ahead of you. ( grunts ) ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) Richard, there's a man with a knife! He's going to kill me! ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) Declan, are you all right? I knew you would protect me. ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) ( <i>majestic theme playing</i> ) (Richard) I can smell the sea. We must be close. (Declan) We're not close, Richard. We're here. ( <i>majestic theme playing</i> ) How high is the sun? Almost right above our heads. Then we don't have much time. Come on. (Kahlan) Richard! Kahlan. Kahlan, we made it! ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) (Richard) Declan, what's happening? ( horse whinnies ) Richard, the Mother Confessor, she's being attacked, by women in red robes. Sisters of The Dark. ( all yelling ) ( whinnies ) Here. Take the stone. Go to the Pillars. Fast. Don't worry, Richard. I'll take it where it needs to go. ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) ( <i>action theme playing</i> ) (Richard) Kahlan! Kill your sisters! ( all grunting ) ( <i>action theme playing</i> ) ( grunts ) ( <i>action theme playing</i> ) ( screams ) ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) ( grunting ) ( blade slices ) ( gasps ) Kahlan? Kahlan, you all right? ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) Give me the stone. Kahlan, what are you doing? How can you disobey me? Give me the stone! I don't have it, but it's all right. I gave it to a boy. He's taking it to the Pillars. No! ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) Kahlan, I think you must be in the Con Dar. Listen to me. That boy is the Keeper! You have fulfilled the Prophecy! Now I can never save my mistress. ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) ( screams ) ( groaning ) ( thunder rumbling ) I know it wasn't you who did this. I love you. ( <i>tender theme playing</i> ) ( <i>mysterious theme playing</i> ) Richard. Richard! Richard? ( <i>tender vocal theme playing</i> ) What have I done? What have I done? ( sobbing ) ( Kahlan crying ) ( <i>tender vocal theme playing</i> ) (Cara) Kahlan! Cara! Hurry, I killed him! ( <i>tender theme playing</i> ) ( <i>mysterious theme playing</i> ) ( Richard gasping ) I failed. I gave the stone away. It seems we have another. ( thunder rumbling ) It may not be too late. ( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> ) ( <i>majestic theme playing</i> ) ( voice of the Keeper ): No! ( <i>majestic theme playing</i> ) Richard, we've done it. ( chuckles ) ( Zedd chuckling ) ( birds cawing ) ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) ( gasps ) Welcome back from the dead, Nicci. ( gasps ) I have great plans for you, now that it appears my brother has defeated the Keeper. But first, I'm going to draw you a nice, warm bath. ( <i>ominous theme playing</i> ) ( Zedd chanting in ancient tongue ) ( <i>tranquil theme playing</i> ) The mark of the Keeper, it's gone. Because we defeated him. Richard, I am so sorry. There's nothing to be sorry for. I killed you. I tried to confess you. It didn't work. How is that possible? (Zedd) For the same reason you were brought out of the Con Dar when Richard died. For the same reason that your tears formed a new stone. Because there is no magic in all the world more powerful than the love you and Richard have for each other. ( <i>tender theme playing</i> )
