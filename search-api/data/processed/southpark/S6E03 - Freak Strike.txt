You've only done jenny once? I hate doing the jenny jones show. They don't even have their own hair people. I'm doing jenny tomorrow. Yeah, you picked a good show to do first, kid. But you need to learn the ropes. There are a lot of people like you all over the country, And we all do talk shows for a living. We all know each other, And we all kind of stick together To make sure our industry is protected. Yeah, like when someone lies about being a freak. Oh, they, they do, huh? Yeah, they'll make up a fake condition To go on these shows and then take our money away.</i> We don't take kindly to that. I can certainly see why. It's okay, folks don't do it anymore. Not after they saw what we did to lobster boy. Lobster boy? Yeah, lobster boy used to make appearances On all the talk shows. He was one of the most popular disfigured people on tv. But then one day we all found out That lobster boy wasn't a real freak at all. He was just an actual lobster. Lying sack of crap. So you know what we did to him? What? One night all us freaks got together And we boiled him alive. Now lobster boy is no more. Oh, yeah, i hate when people fake conditions too. Those stupid fakers. We're glad you agree. Okay, boy-With-Balls- On-His-Chin, You're up next. Oh, jesus, see me through this. Today on the maury povich show We bring back some of our favorite disfigured people And introduce you to some new ones. Here he comes! This is gonna be awesome!

Please welcome 8Â½-Year-Old napoleon bonaparte From south park, colorado. Thanks so much for coming on our show. Oh, that's okay, i suppose. So, is it tough being... different? Ah, yeah. And do all the kids at school make fun of you? They sure do! They always say to me, "butters, you're not kenny." But i never said i was kenny. They say kenny would do this, and kenny would do that- Uh-Oh, we're losing him. I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas? Kenny's dead, and you just have to deal with it. Ah, yeah, but i mean, Do the kids at school make fun of you Because of your condition? What condition? You have balls that hang off your chin. I do?! Oh, oh, i mean yeah, i do.

When i'm walking they'll say, "hey, there goes chin balls." And do they call you freak and weirdo? Yeah, i suppose. And do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born?
