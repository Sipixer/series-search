Oh, i'm sorry, But i thought we were at war with these assholes! We're at war with terrorists, fat-Ass, Not with afghanistan. And the only reason you care Is 'cause you don't wanna give up a dollar. That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, you want me to just get a regular milk for 10 cents? Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We aren't the ones bombing them now. We're just kids. There's a lot of crazy stuff going on in the world, But we're just caught in the middle. It's not our fault. The afghan kids are caught in the middle, too. Yes, but they're sand monkeys! All right, children, we're all sending a dollar To the kids in afghanistan. That's it, end of discussion! God damn it, i hate regular milk! Eh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Another high alert status for terrorist activity this weekend. The government said bad things are likely to happen.

I don't smell any- Oh, oh god! Oh, whatever. You son of a bitch, cartman. You don't fart when you're locked in a small space With other people! Oh, i'm sorry! Next time i'll just ask my fart nicely If it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while! All right, let's just get the goat back to his home. We have to find this address. God, what a craphole, dude! This is like east denver, jesus christ! Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this. If i grew up here i'd be pissed off too. Hey, look, there's a taxi. Hello. We need to go here. God, what is this, the friggin' "flintsones"? Is this the right house? I think so. Uh, hi, we're from america. Ah, we sent you the dollar, the $4. You sent us this goat. Goat? Here, we don't want it. Oh, you want something else? All we had was the goat. Your country bombed everything else. No, dude, we're not ungrateful. It's just none of us can keep the goat. It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in america, So we brought it back to your crappy country. Oh, and here. Take this american flag as a gift. Yay! Yay! Yay! Hey, what the hell are you doing? They told us in school everyone but terrorists love america. Ha! What did you call us? Your country is the evil empire. Your government wants to rule the world! But your values and spiritualism are in the gutter. Then why did you send us a goat? Because in afghanistan we have pride. If you send us something We must send something in return. It doesn't mean we don't still hate you. Now, get out of here! Hey, hey, open the door. I told you, "jawas" have no hearts. Jawas? You know, sand people. How come they hate america so much? What the hell did we do? Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates americans We better just leave the goat and get back to the plane. All right. Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad. God, i hate you so much, stan. What? Howdy. Ah... greetings from canada. Well, boys, it's "aboot" time We get to our "hoose" in canada, isn't it? Hey, what the hell are you talking about?! I'm not a god damn canadian and neither are you! Oh, cartman, you stupid asshole. ...osama bin laden! Good job, fat-Ass. Dude, don't call me a canadian.

And this just in: The taliban has apparently taken American civilians as hostages. The taliban has just released this videotape In which it is clearly visible That they have indeed captured stevie nicks. Miss nicks appears to be in good spirits, Though her whereabouts are unknown. Hey, sh-Sharon, Have you seen stan in the last couple days? Yes, i just saw him. Oh, okay. With stevie nicks in captivity The other members of fleetwood mac have been hidden So the taliban can't get to them as well. They... took stevie nicks? Bastards. Heartless, gutless bastards! All right, men. Grab your guns and your bibles. We're going to get miss nicks back. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! The taliban's video also shows What appears to be four american children in captivity, Though they could just be french. We have to help them. They are not the spies. They came to give us our goat back. Screw them! They're evil americans. I know, but you if we don't help the innocent ones Then we are no better than the americans are. Help americans?

They told us in school, and on tv, That most people in afghanistan and pakistan like america. And you believe it? It is not just the taliban that hates america. Over a third of the world hates america. But why, why does a third of the world hate us? Because you don't realize That a third of the world hates you. That doesn't make sense.

Most people in america are good people Who just try to live day by day like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time To see all the great things about our country You'd see we're not so different after all. Yeah. That's fine, but we still hate you. Oh... Well, i guess maybe some day We can learn to hate you, too. Maybe, in time. I'm confused. Great job, troops. Once again we have killed our enemies! Hooray! We sure did!
