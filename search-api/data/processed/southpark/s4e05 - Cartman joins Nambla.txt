Why the hell does the f.B.I. Keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of stan and kyle. God, i hate those guys! See, i told you, dude! Those are dialysis machines. Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube And it sucks all their body fluids out. Oh, man, that's terrible! I know, huh? Put your mouth against the glass, like this. Wah! Yeah, haaa! Bleh-Leh-Leh-Leh! Wha-La-La-La-La! All right, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing? We're making faces at sick people. No! I mean what the hell are you doing? Why are all my mature adult friends being mysteriously arrested, huh? We don't know. I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, So you started a government conspiracy against me! We don't know what you're talking about, lard butt. Lard butt, oh, that's so mature. God, i guess i was wrong about you guys, huh? You're not more mature than us, cartman. Yes, i am! I'm telling you this is all a terrible mistake, officer barbrady. Well, the f.B.I said i have to hold you here, So that's what i'm going to do, mr. Complainy-Pants. Oh! Do you like having your back rubbed? Eat me, pervert. Okay. We demand you release these men at once. Who are you? We are "nambla", The north american man-Boy love association And we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping. Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters. Loving young boys has been around since the time of the romans, pal. There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing That sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing! Yeah! Yeah! Uh, i don't know who you are, But these men aren't going any where until i hear from the f.B.I. Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer, yeah. Okay, people, i think you'd better move along before i arrest more of you. All these men wanted was to love a young boy, There is nothing wrong with love. I did not want love from a young boy, I like men my own age. Ah! I mean- I like women, what did i say? Oh god, i love titties! You haven't heard the last of us, officer. Together we are strong. Come on, men! Yeah! Yeah! Well, they got activists for everything these days. I've done it, kevin! I've successfully gene-Spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese. Do you know what this means, kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places For squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick- Who could that be? Why, it's little eric cartman. Doctor mefesto, i need help. Of course, come in. See, unfortunately, i have matured faster than all my friends. I want to hang out with older friends, but i can't find any. So i was wondering if you can geneticly engineer some older friends for me. Oh, eric, i'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state Where i can just make people. Damn it, but i want to hang out with older guys! Oh, well,i happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called "nambla". "Nambla"? Yes, i've been a member for several years. I'm sure they'll let you join, you look about right. Okay, thanks, sure. Doctor mefesto! Fellow members of "nambla", As you know, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently the f.B.I.

Fellow nambla members, It is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! First and foremost, i want to recognize eric cartman For putting us in touch with all you pretty young boys. Thank you, thank you very much. Now, i know that many of us have already found partners in this fine city And i'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members. This is boring. Yeah. Hey, when are we going to get to some action, huh? Oooh! Ha-Ha! Goodness, what a gift from god. We'll get to it very soon, i'll assure you. But first, i'd just like to hear from a couple of you on your progress. Yes, patrick. I found a little 8-Year-Old named butters, He's a beautiful bright little boy. Well, i sure am, i guess. And his skin is as soft as fresh linen. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! That seems kind of weird. Well, my skin is "springtime" soft, i suppose. Wonderful. And how about you mr. Harris? Well, i want to announce that i may have found the dream boy of the decade, He's sexy, sassy and full of spark. His name is timmy. Timmy! Tim-My? Well, members, i know we're all eager To get acquainted with our new partners. So why don't we turn down the lights and start the dance. All right, i want these perverted bastards all taken in, got it? Got it! Fellow nambla members, As the south park representative- Hold it right there! Nobody move! What's going on? All right, sickos, where are the children? What children? This is "nambla", yes. Right? "The north american man-Boy love association". What? No! We're "the north american marlon brando look-A-Likes." Oh crap, we've got the wrong "nambla". Oh, damn it, i'm in the wrong place! Don't tell me that other "nambla" is actually in south park. You know of them? We've been fighting with them for years over the rights to "nambla.Com". Yeah, those perverted bastards! Wow, you guys really dolook a lot like marlon brando. Thank you. Now, let's go get those other "nambla" bastards Before they hurt any south park children! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! And let's kick their asses for stealing our domain name! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! All right, members, that's enough of that. It's time for for us all to retire to our respective rooms And get to know our new young boys. All right! Dude, being mature is boring. Yeah!

Well, look those perverts aren't going to rest Until they've made love to one of us, right? So somebody is just going to have to go out there And take one for the team. And i think in all fairness, it should be butters. Huh, well, why me? Are you a team player or not? Yeah, sure, i'm a team player, i guess. Well, butters, there is no "i" in team. You mean you expect me to go out there and let all those horny old men Have their way with my fragile person? Just what team is this anyway? Just go, butters, we're running out of time. Oh, all right then. He's such a dumb ass. All right, men, here i come. I'm ready to take one for the team. Kenny, kenny, i've had enough of your shenanigins! Ooh, one of the boys just came in! I get him first! What the-? Oh no! Ahhhhh! Are you all right, stuart? Don't touch me. I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned And been made love to in the ass by 3 dozen 40-Year-Old men. I just want to go home and take a hot bath. We've been after you for a long time, buddy. Do you know your rights? Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, i've learned something today, Our forefathers came to this country because they believed in an idea. An idea called freedom. They wanted to live in a place where a group Couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live. You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand. Dude, you have sex with children. We are human. Most of us didn't evenchooseto be attracted to young boys, We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, And if you all can't understand that, well, Then i guess you'll just have to put us away. Dude, you have sexwith children. Yeah, you know, we believe in equality for everybody And all that gay stuff, but dude, You. Seriously. Alright, that's enough, you're all going to be put away for a long time. Well, cartman. Well, what? Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing "nambla" here? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! All right, all right. I'm sorry i almost got you guys all raped, there. And now do you still think you need to hang out with older, mature friends? No, i guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday, Just don't take too long. Okay, let's roll. Coo-Coochie-Coo coo-Coochie-Coo. Our little angel, yes. Oh, he's so beautiful! I know it's been hard on both of us, losing poor kenny. But this knew baby kinda reminds me of him. What should we name him? Well, seeing as though kenny passed away, Maybe we should name him... Kenny. Yes, kenny is such a great name. My little kenny, a brand-New kenny.
