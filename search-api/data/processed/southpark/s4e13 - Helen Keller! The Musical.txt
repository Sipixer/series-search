Uh, timmy, if we go back to other kids with that turkey, They're gonna be pissed. Timmy! Yeah, best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and put a bullet in its head.

His name is gobbles. Gobbles! And where, pray, is our beautiful trick-Performing turkey? Um, we sort of spent all the money on this one. Gobbles! Kyle, can i talk to you over here for a second? Kyle, why do you do these things to me? I didn't do anything to you! Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What did you want me to say to him? You say "no, timmy, you can't have that turkey, bad timmy!" Look, i know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it. He's not gonna work, kyle. The whole point is to make our play better than the kindergartners! Yeah, that turkey sucks. Wait... ? What's that you say? ? A thanksgiving turkey is what you require? ? I know of a turkey? You do?! ? During my years on broadway? ? I worked with a turkey that could do all kinds of tricks? ? She even jumped through a hoop of fire? Cool, can you get it for us? ? I will go promptly and call her trainer? ? On the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey? Alright! Alright! Gobbles! Gobbles! Ergh, ergh. Hargh, gobbles! Gobbles. Gobbles! No, no, no! Poopsiekins, it's late, you need to be in bed. I can't sleep, mom, i have to write the lyrics to the opening song Of our helen keller thanksgiving spectacular. Now, hon. But mom! I have to write these lyrics so the plight of helen keller Can be realized by the common ma-An! Twenty more minutes and that's it. Twenty minutes, did tim rice's mom give him twenty minutes To write the lyrics to phantom of the opera?! Speak to me, helen. Let me be your voice. Come on, you blind bitch, channel your spirit through me! Tonight, we present the story of a courageous girl And her fight against depression. Oppression! Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time. Alabama, in the late 1800s... ? 1800s? ? Alabama? ? What a great place in time? ? We're so happy that we live in 1800s alabama? ? 'Cause it's sunny and there is no crime? Now to the refrain! ? And in our little town of 1800s alabama? ? There's a family by the name of keller? ? Their daughter's deaf and mute and blind as a bat? ? And her parents can't even tell her? Excuse me, i am lamonde, the animal trainer. Oh cool, he's here! Awesome, do you have a turkey that can do tricks?! Ahp, ahp, do not call them "tricks". She's a very sensitive turkey, And she performs "feats" not "tricks". Ladies and gentlemen, may i present the most beautiful bird in america. Four-Time prize winner at the national western stock show And reigning poster child of turkeylovers.Com. I give you... alinicia! Oooh! Whoa! Wow! Her feathers are beautiful! That's the prettiest turkey i ever saw. Of course she is. Okay, now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody, where the hell is timmy? Timmy! What is that? Uh, that's gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. Gobbles! Gobbles? Timmy, we already got a turkey. Yeah, and it's from broadway! Gobbles! No, timmy, the handicapped turkey does not go in our play! Dude, don't forget, timmy's the only kid who can play helen keller. Don't piss him off. That's right, only timmy knows the part. Timmy. Oh, jesus, okay, fine! Helen keller can have two pet turkeys! My turkey does not work with other turkeys! Oh, goddammit, now what are we gonna do? Alright, alright. Alright, alright! Dude, we need your turkey for our play! She's not coming out, she's very upset. She's pooped all over the room. I know, i know, but listen. Let me try to explain the position i'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend timmy, And timmy is the only person who knows the part of helen keller. So tell me what i can do here to make everybody happy. Kill the other turkey. I can't, dude, timmy has a boner for it. Well, it could meet with an... Unfortunate accident. Unfortunate accident? You mean like geena davis getting her own t.V. Show? Ha ha ha- Oh... It's very simple. Either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident, Or you don't have a feat-Performing turkey For your helen keller thanksgiving musical! Alright, alright, just get your turkey To stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal. I'll take care of everything. Water, helen, it has a name! Oh, why can't you understand?! Duh, agh! ? Wat-Er he-Len wa-Ter? ? She's never gonna do it? ? There's no way she'll ever do it? ? Spell it helen water helen? ? How can she talk if she can't hear? ? This is absolutely pointless? Okay, uh, hold it! Let's hold it right there a second. Okay, i just want to adjust some of the blocking real quick. Let's see... Uh, why don't we have turkey number two Stand just a little more over m'yha... Let's see, maybe a little bit more up in m'yha... And just a wee bit over m'yha... And right about... M'hya. There we go, good. Oh my gah, ey killed kenny! Ooohhh! Crap, i must have rigged the wrong light. ? Let him rest? ? In peace let him rest? ? Why must he die...? They've got special effects! What, butters? The kindergartners, they've got amazing stage effects! Pyrotechnics and what have yous! Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes! Oh no! We're never gonna outdo them now! Oh no! Special effects?! Calm down, calm down! We can have special effects too! Now i know a lot is going wrong, But we've got to stick together to make this play work. All of us. ? And into your hands...? Gobbles! Aaahh, gobbles! Little boy! Timmy. Yes, tim. I feel i must speak with you. The others, well, they don't want you to know, but- Oh, i don't know what to do, should i tell you? Timmy? I feel i'm the only one who can be honest with you. The animal shelter is on its way to take your turkey away from you. Gobbles?! You see, they don't allow children in your "situation" To have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They have to take it away. Gobbles! They take wild pets away from people like you And hand them over for experiments. And they're shocked, dissected and flayed While they're still alive. And no matter where you go the shelter people will find you. The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture, Is for you to let him go, back into the wild. Oh no, here they come now! Quick, go and set your turkey free! I'll try to stall them. Timmy! Excuse me, we're here to install the water effects for the musical. The stage is right through there. Thanks. Alright, i've got to write the new lyrics. Let's see... No, no! Goddammit! ? How is it going eric? Terrible, i can't write the lyrics for the third act. Nothing's coming to me! Well, you know, in theater sometimes we try different tricks To get the creative juices flowing. Like what? Let's see, helen keller was blind and deaf, Perhaps you should see what it is like. ? Deprive yourself of your senses? ? And see what plays inside your mind? Here. Hey, that's not a bad idea. ? Just relax? ? Just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow? Oh, man! Well, did you see anything? No, just the same old crap i always see when i close my eyes. Oh, that's too bad. Wait, i've got it! The perfect setup for when helen keller's pet turkey Jumps through the hoop of fire! Yes! Yes, i have it now! The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture, Is for you to let him go. Let him go... let him go. Gobbles. Gobbles! Gobbles. Gobbles! Gobbles! Timmy. Timmy, gobbles. Daddy, why did mommy leave and go to heaven? She didn't want to, kevin, she had no choice. But i miss her. I could have done so much more with my life, son. I've wasted it. Not ever telling you and monica I love you. Robbie! Robbie, no! Because now every time i look at you... I see her. I have to move on. Kelly, please, don't do this. I'm sorry! Then why did you do it? I don't know! Have you done the right things in your life? Hi, sheila! Hello, sharon, where's your husband? He's in the back. He set up a video camera so that he could tape the performance. Oh, so did gerald. Oh yeah, i got a great angle here. Hey gerald, maybe after the show We can make copies of each other's tapes, so we have both. Good idea! So wait... Do we do the spin around thing on the last beat? No, ude, on ne n and ne hree. You ready for the big show, timmy? Where's gobbles, timmy? Gobbles. Alright, everybody, let's take our places! Cartman, where is timmy's turkey? I don't know. I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe i tried to have timmy's turkey crushed by a stagelight, But i didn't do anything else, i'm not an asshole! You're going to be brilliant! You sexy, gorgeous turkey.
