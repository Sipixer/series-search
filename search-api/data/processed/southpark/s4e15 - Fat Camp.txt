to south park? ? Gonna have myself a time? ? Friendly faces everywhere? ? Humble folks without temptation? ? Going down to south park? ? Gonna leave my woes behind? ? Ample parking day or night? ? People spouting "howdy neighbor"? ? Headed on up to south park? ? Gonna see if i can't unwind? ? So come on down to south park? ? And meet some friends of mine? All right, children, as i'm sure you all remember, Today we're gonna continue our biology lesson By dissecting an organism. Yeah! Woo-Hoo! Now, what we are going to dissect today Is the west indian manatee. Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans And are often called "the gentle clowns of the sea". Uh, miss choksondik, aren't manatees endangered? They sure are, wendy. And that's why we must learn what's inside them. Now, we don't have quite enough manatees to go around So i think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four. Hey, ours is still alive! Oh, hold on. Uh, uh! Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen. I can't do it, dude. Oh, don't be such a baby. You do it, kenny. Unh-Uh. Come on, kenny, i'll give you five bucks to do it. Five bucks! Too bad cartman's missing this, he must be really sick. Say, terrance, This body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso. I don't see anything. Look closer. Closer. I still don't see anything, phillip. Wait, wait. I know what's gonna happen, mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen? Keep looking, terrance, the forensic evidence is right around here. Whoa, that totally surprised me! I can't believe how this show manages to stay fresh, huh, mom? Yes, sweetie. Mom... Can you go make me a toaster-Pastry- Chocolate-Mix-Butter bar? Oh, honey, why don't you go make it yourself. Mommy's expecting some company. God, i have to do everything around here! ? You'll never find...? ?... No matter where you search? ? Someone who loves you tender? ? Like i do? ? I'm not braggin' on myself, baby? ? But the-? What the hell's going on? Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a "talk" with you. Eric, your friends and your family Are all concerned about your weight, m'kay. What? We believe that you might have a problem. You're goddamn right i have a problem! "Terrance and phillip" is on and i don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?! It's called intervention, eric. Your friends and i have all chipped in And we're going to send you up to a weight management retreat. Fat camp? Yes, fat camp. All right, i don't know who the hell put you all up to this, But i am sure as hell not going to any gay-Ass fat camp! Now, eric, all these people came here And paid to send you to camp because they care about you. Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you. Mom, tell them. Tell them i'm not fat, i'm just big-Boned. Tell them all the stories about how everyone in your family Was big as a child but then grew into their bodies. Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. And now, we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for- Ah, miss choksondik, can we have a quick word with you? All right. Continue with the removal of the spleen, children, i'll be right back. Oh, dude, check this out. That's so gross. Hey, kenny, how much for you to eat this? I won't eat it. I'll give you 10 bucks to eat it. I'll throw in five. And so apparently there's been a little mix-Up. The manatees were meant to go to the denver shelter aquarium And the frogs were meant to come here. Oh dear. I'll throw in a dollar! I got three. Come on, dude, all you gotta do is eat it really fast. 41 bucks. Eww-Hoo! He did it. All right, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together. And it has basketball courts and tennis courts. And you can call mommy anytime you want. Oh, sweetie-Kins, don't be mad, I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back, you'll be all healthy and thin. Howdy there, i'm one of the weight counselors here. This must be eric cartman. Yes, i'm afraid he's a little moody. Oh, we'll change that. Hello, camper, my name is rick, how are you doing? Well, i'm pissed off, rick, how are you? I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get you oriented. I'll take care of him from here, ma'am. Oh, well, good-Bye, sweetie. Don't touch me. Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you! Have you got any candy? No. My mom says i ain't to eat no candy here, I'm supposed to lose weight. All right! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business. Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn That losing weight is fun, right, gang? Right. Wait a second, do you kids hear something? Why, i could've swore that- Rrrar! Oh no, kids, it's glutinous fat! I'm gonna take over your body and make you slow. Oh, what are we going to do? Wait, i know. I can knock it out, with? Exercise! And? Proper diet. Oh no! Exercise and proper diet have killed me. I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we, kids? Yeah! Well, hold on a second, Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend susan! Who's another weight counselor! Heh, it was a lady in a costume. Would somebody put this retard out of his misery? What's the matter? Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. Uh-Oh, i guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. Eww! Well, at least you got it out of your system. Oh, dude, you can still kind of see the spleen! How much, kenny? What?! I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke. I'm in for five. Oh, you guys. I got three. Six. Uh, here, you can scoop it up in my r. Kelly thermos. That's 19 bucks, kenny. Ohh! Eww. Kick ass, dude! Y'know, dude, there might be something to this. Yeah, people are willing to pay big money to see kenny do this stuff. Doing great, kids, come on! This... is... bull crap! Well, i sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar, How about you, gang? I'm starving. This is it, i'm going to die here. I hope you all left room for dessert- Soybean pudding for everybody! Are you gonna eat your soybean pudding? Take it, i can't eat this crap! Me neither, i have to have sugar or i'm gonna die. Yeah, well, when i was in prison, We use to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass. I've got some fudge hidden up my ass, you want some? Pssh- Yeah, i'm not falling for that one again. All right, clyde frog, We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free. We did it, clyde frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor mom and friends, Or do we start a new life on the run? An ice cream truck! Hey, wait! Boy, am i glad to see you. Can i interest you in some ice cream? You're damn right you can! Two "roller pops", please. Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? Huh? Oh! They tricked us again, huh? Oh godammit, let me out of here! Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. They always get us. Sometimes it's an ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us. I can't help it. I'd give anything, any amount of money for some candy. Hey, kids! Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight. Escape-Aroo. Now, campers, i know that camp is tough, But you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight You can't leave! There is no escape. So, let's just all put on our "try hard" helmets And accept that the only way for us to get out of camp Is to lose the weight! God dammit! Thanks for coming, everybody. What's all this about, mrs. Cartman, Is eric having trouble at his weight management camp? We knew he wouldn't make it. Oh, no, quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, i would like to present to you The new eric cartman. Hey, dudes! Whoa! I don't believe it. Believe it, he lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay! Congratulations, how do you feel? I feel awesome. What the hell did they do with all the fat? That must've been enough to last an eskimo family months. Y'know, kyle, there was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me, But now i'm totally slim and totally happy. In fact, i'd say i'm a little bit trimmer than you, fat boy. Heh heh, just kidding, kyle. I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some? Me, me, me, me! Dude, i don't know if i'm gonna like the new eric cartman. Did you like the old one? Good point. And now back to "jesus and pals" on south park public access. Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea, you found that the spirit of the lord inside you gave you strength. No, actually i found a diet that totally works. A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for eric cartman! Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named kenny mckormick Who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? Whoa! No! Yes! Woo-Hoo! Yeah! Dammit, all i got was a little golf clap. Thanks for coming on the show, kenny. Sure. Do it again! Do it again! Hey kid, i'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon. This is ridiculous! So, kenny, how did you discover that you had this talent? We thought of it, jesus. I mean, kenny's the one that does it all, But we were the masterminds of the whole thing. I can't say i approve of this, my children. Huh, why not? Because kenny is only doing things that anybody could do... For money. He's a prostitute. I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone else's vomit. Yeah, go for it! Yeah! What's a prostitute? I don't know. Hello there, children. Hey, chef! Hey, chef! Chef, what's a prostitute? Dag nabbit, children! How come every time you come in here You gotta be asking me questions i shouldn't be answering? "Chef, what's a clitoris? What's a lesbian, chef? How come they call it a 'rim job', chef?" For once, can't you just come in here and say, "Hi, chef, nice day, isn't it?" Hi, chef, nice day, isn't it? It sure is, thank you. Chef, what's a prostitute? Unh-Uh, you children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again. Lunchtime, i'm starved! Oh my god! Eric? That's me. Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is. Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway? Because jesus told us that kenny's a prostitute, is he? Yeah, am i? Well, no, of course kenny is not a prostitute. Why? Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... You can pay for certain services. Like what? Like keeping you company - Understand? No. You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman, But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, The woman just want to talk and talk and talk and talk. ? But a prostitute is someone who would love you? ? No matter who you are or what you look like? Yes, it's true children. ? That's not why you pay a prostitute? ? No, you don't pay for her to stay? ? You're paying her to leave afterward? ? That's why i praise the lord for prostitute? Ladies and gentlemen, mr. James taylor. ? A prostitute is like any other woman? ?
