Well, if we find a pony, we can train it, Train it to bite off scott tenorman's wiener. It will be painful and humiliating. Everyone will see it happen.

But, years from now, when you're old And have children of your own, What would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, where you could have made a difference.

I see scott tenorman, With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles, And god damn it, i hate him, i hate him! No, young hunter, i mean, what do yousee? You must learn all you can about your kill. Right, right. Let's see... There's posters, radioheadposters. And he's reading a magazine about radiohead. What's a radiohead? You know, the band that sings that song. ? Well, i'm a creep i'm a weirdo? ? What am i doing here? Oh, jesus, don't start singing, ned. So, the subject is a big radiohead fan, huh? Maybe i should come up with a lit'l scheme That involves them. Nice thinking, young hunter. Whoa. What? I'm looking in scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra. What?! Give me those! Holy crow, he's right, ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out. Let me see. Radiohead... yes, of course. Dear god, they're even bigger than i ever imagined! Let me see, let me see!

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, It's time for the amazing pube boy! ? I'm a little piggy here's my snout? ? Oink, oink, oink oink, oink, oink? ? I'm a little piggy here's my snout?

And if you help me, i'll give each of you two dollars. Okay, so what's the plan? It's a brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott's favorite band is radiohead, right? Yeah? So, i realized, What if we got radiohead to come here to south park, right? Then they could meet scott tenorman,and, See him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! What? Don't you see? If i can get this pony to bite off scott's wiener in front of radiohead, Then scott would cry. And if scott cries, then radiohead will think Scott tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make scott tenorman want to die. Ha, ha, ha! Okay, i'll keep working on the pony, You guys go get radiohead to play here. Ready? Break! You're such a dumb-Ass, cartman.

How could i turn it down? Sweet, killer. Bye, scott. Oh, you are good, eric, you are very, very good. Mom, dad, that was my good friend eric at the door. He told me that there's a starving pony At jenkins ranch that's been abandoned. Oh, dear. Yeah, i feel really bad, But i don't know how i can help it Because i have a lot of homework to do. Well, don't you worry, scott, Your mom and i can go get the pony And have it taken to an animal shelter. We sure can. Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now. Oh, scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you. I'm proud of you too, mom. Let's go, hon. Let's. What are you doing, scott? What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods? We got everyone we could find to chip in. There's pubes from just about every kid in town in here. Awesome. Oh, dude! The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when i tell him he just ate the pubes Of every kid in town. Yeah! Oh, hello, guys, thanks for coming to my chili con carnival. This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, cartman. Oh, it won't be so dumb when scott tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks. Oh, we will. Trust us, we wouldn't miss this. What's so funny? Oh, nothing, it's just cool How you're gonna get scott tenorman back. Is radiohead here yet? Not yet, but they will be. Yeah, sure. Hello, eric. Hey, chef. I made some chili to enter into the contest. What contest? This is a chili cook-Off, ain't it? Huh? Oh, yeah, i guess it is. Here, just put it over here. It's my special recipe. Scott tenorman! How are you, scott? Thanks so much for coming. Oh, i wouldn't miss this for anything. Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony. Just a second. Don't you wanna taste my chili first? Well, yeah, but there's a special guest coming And i want you to be near the pony when they arrive. Well, i don't want it to get cold. I think i can win first prize. All right, scott, let's go over to the judging table And we'll try the chili first. God damn it. All right, i guess we should taste each other's chili, huh? This chili looks pretty good. Here's mine. Mmm, i don't know, your chili is good, cartman. But i think mine is better, try it. All right. Hey, this is great! It's a special recipe. God, this is really good, scott. I'm glad you like it so much, Because now that you're almost finished, I have something to tell you. What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? What?! Yes, i'm afraid this isn't your chili, scott. I switched it with chef's. It's delicious, chef. I hadn't planned on that. What i did plan on, however, Was that my friends stan and kyle would betray me And warn you that the chili con carnival was a trap. I assumed that they would tell you That i trained jenkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that jenkins is a crazy redneck Who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would go and try to do something to the pony, I warned mr. Jenkins that violent pony killers were in the area. I also knew that you wouldn't go yourself For fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. And. I'm afraid that when mr. Jenkins spotted them on his property He shot and killed both your parents. Well, they was trespassin' and i was protectin' myself. I have my rights. My... mom and dad are dead? I came just in time to see Mr. Jenkins giving his report to officer barbrady, And of course to steal the bodies. After a night with the hacksaw, i was all ready To put on my chili con carnival. So that i could tell you personally about your parents' demise. And of course, feed you your chili. Do you like it? Do you like it, scott? I call it... "mr. And mrs. Tenorman chili". Oh, my god! Oh, my god! ? Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah? ? I made you eat your parents? ? Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah? Jesus christ, dude! My mom and dad are dead! No, no! Ah, excuse me? Who are you? We're that band, radiohead. Jeez, what a little crybaby. You gonna cry all day, crybaby? You know, everyone has problems, It doesn't mean you have to be a little crybaby about it. Come on, guys, let's go, This kid is totally not cool. Yeah, that's the most uncool kid i've ever met. Little crybaby. No, wait! Wait! Oh my god! Oh my god! Yes! Yes! Oh, let me taste your tears, scott. Mmm, your tears are so yummy, sweet. Dude, i think it might be best for us to never piss cartman off again. Good call. Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness. Mmm, yummy, yummy, guys. Yibbidy-Bip- That's all, folks! Captioning made possible by
