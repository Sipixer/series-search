LIFE IS PAIN, LIFE IS ONLY PAIN. WE'RE ALL TAUGHT TO BELIEVE IN HAPPY, FAIRY TALE ENDINGS, BUT THERE IS ONLY BLACKNESS. DARK, DEPRESSING LONELINESS THAT EATS AT YOUR SOUL. WHO NEEDS THAT KEN AND BARBIE LOVE, ANYWAY ? EVERYONE'S JUST WALKING AROUND LIKE A BUNCH OF CONFORMISTS. GO AHEAD AND WEAR YOUR BUSINESS SUITS, SO YOU CAN MAKE $34,0000 A YEAR AND BUY YOUR CONDOMINIUM. THEY'RE LIKE ZOMBIES, RACING TO THEIR GRAVES. LOVE DIDN'T WORK FOR MY MOM AND DAD, WHY SHOULD IT WORK FOR ME ? MY DAD IS SUCH AN ASSHOLE, DRUNKEN BASTARD DOESN'T EVEN KNOW I EXIST, BUT THEN HE WON'T LET ME GO TO THE SKINNY PUPPY CONCERT BECAUSE MY HEROIN ADDICT AUNT IS COMING OVER FOR DINNER. DINNER ? THAT'S A LAUGH, JUST AN EXCUSE FOR MY MOM TO BITCH AT ME FOR NOT WEARING GIRLY CLOTHES LIKE ALL THE BRITNEY SPEARS WANNABES AT THIS SCHOOL. THEY'RE ALL A BUNCH OF NAZI CONFORMIST CHEERLEADERS. BUT IF LIFE IS ONLY PAIN, THEN, WHAT'S THE POINT OF LIVING ? JUST TO MAKE LIFE MORE MISERABLE FOR THE CONFORMISTS. ALL RIGHT, SO HOW DO I JOIN YOU ? IF YOU WANT TO BE ONE OF THE NON-CONFORMISTS, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DRESS JUST LIKE US AND LISTEN TO THE SAME MUSIC WE DO. 'KAY. OKAY, I KNOW IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY, FERRARI, SO I WANT TO GO OVER THE BASICS WITH YOU. OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S A FIVE-FOOT RULE: IF YOU COME WITHIN FIVE FEET OF A CUSTOMER, YOU NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM, EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT AT YOUR TABLE, "HEY, CUTIE !" WHEN YOU'RE NOT SERVING FOOD OR TALKING WITH CUSTOMERS, YOU NEED TO DANCE AROUND AND HAVE FUN. WE HAVE THINGS LIKE HOOLA-HOOPS, SILLY STRING AND WATER GUNS TO PLAY WITH THE OTHER GIRLS. BE SURE TO GIGGLE A LOT, AND BE SURE TO SHOW OFF YOUR RAISINS. NOW, WHEN YOU TAKE A CUSTOMER'S ORDER, YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH THEM. IT MAKES THEM THINK YOU'RE INTERESTED. WRITE YOUR NAME DOWN FOR THEM, AND MAKE THEM FEEL SPECIAL. "OH MAN, I AM SO BORED, THANK GOD YOU GUYS CAME IN !" IF YOU WANT GOOD TIPS, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS PHYSICAL CONTACT, JUST A SIMPLE HOLD OF THE ARM CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN $5 AND $20. "I'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOUR ORDER, GUYS !" WOW, THANK YOU SO MUCH, MERCEDES. OKAY, WELL I GUESS WE'RE READY TO OPEN FOR BUSINESS, GOOD LUCK. GO AHEAD AND OPEN FOR BUSINESS, PORSCHE. OKAY ! HI, WELCOME TORAISINS ! HI, IS LEXUS HERE ?! HEY, CUTIE ! DARLING ! HOW'RE WE DOING TODAY ?! OH GOD, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. "SHALLOW LIFE, DROWNING ALONE I GASP FOR AIR. "COLDNESS CREEPS OVER PALE SKIN. "THERE IS SADNESS SO DEEP IT PULLS ME DOWN. HAPPINESS DIES IN THE DEEP, DARK SEA." YEAH, HAPPINESS DIES. YEAH. ALL RIGHT, YOUR TURN, STAN. READ ONE OF YOUR POEMS ABOUT PAIN. "THERE IS DARKNESS ALL AROUND ME. "DEEP, PIERCING BLACK I CANNOT BREATHE. MY HEART HAS BEEN RAPED." WHOA. "THE PAIN IS EVERLASTING, I MISS YOU SO MUCH, BABE. WANT TO HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS AGAIN, GIRL--" WHOA, WHOA, DUDE, THOSE LAST TWO LINES AREN'T GOTH. THEY'RE NOT ? NO, DUDE, YOU CAN'T SAY, "I MISS YOU SO MUCH, BABE. I WANT TO HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS." MAKE IT, "I MISS SEEING YOU SO MUCH, I WANT TO SLICE MY EYES OUT WITH RAZOR BLADES." HENRIETTA, HI, SWEETIE ! GO AWAY, MOM ! LEAVE ME ALONE ! DADDY AND I JUST GOT YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT ! BUT YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT IT IS 'TIL TOMORROW ! YOU'D LIKE TO WAIT 'TIL I WAS DEAD, WOULDN'T YOU ? YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THE MAGGOTS EAT MY FACE. YOU ARE SO CREATIVE, HONEY ! CONFORMIST BITCH. ( all ) YEAH.

LEXUS, I... OH GEEZ, MAYBE I SHOULDN'T SAY IT... NO, WAIT, I WANT TO SAY IT... I LOVE YOU ! HEE HEE ! OH MY GOSH ! DAD, I NEED AN ADVANCE ON MY ALLOWANCE AGAIN.
