- But someone did. - I'll take the case. You tell my ex-wife I own her now. No more talk of alimony, no more child support. We're beyond even. Tim Foyle? This can't be good. That's it, Bonnie. I've had enough! Logan and I hooked up in Aspen over the holidays. I guess you two were split, huh? I don't want you to go. I wish I didn't have to. Hello? Either you're affecting a sexy phone voice or you even make "hello" sound good. What time is it? I've got to go. I'm late for work. Work, right. Are you sure you're not getting a body wrap... and a blow out for our fancy date tonight. You got me. I better haul ass if I want to fit in that brow shaping. - And Veronica? - Yeah. Don't go changing. See you later. Oh, I've changed. From the girl who slept, to one who doesn't. Closing my eyes means popping in the Madison tape and pressing play. Veronica? Bonnie! Can we talk? Sure. Tim's talked about you. A lot. Affectionately, I'm sure. So what can I do for you? I got pregnant. and someone slipped me RU-486. - RU... - It causes a miscarriage. And I want you to find out who it was. Veronica Mars Thereâ€™s Got to Be a Morning After Pill Transcript: Inigo [vmtranscripts.com] Synchro: Camilla, Michele [veronicamars.it] Vieni a trovarci! veronicamars.it The miscarriage, you're sure it was intentional? I didn't think so at first, but then the doctor saw that I had this weird rash and that my hands and feet were numb. He said it looked like I was having an allergic reaction to the RU-486. I told him I didn't take any. He did a blood test. Confirmed it. I'm so sorry, Bonnie. I'm looking for the least rude way to ask you... if you know who the father was... And that's what I came up with. It was Tim. Or Dick. Fair enough. So, did Tim or Dick know about the baby? They both did. At first I was just so freaked out, I didn't even think I wanted to keep the baby. I went to Dick and asked if he'd help pay for the procedure. How did that go? He said he'd pay... after I got a paternity test. Yeah. He's a classy dude. But Tim has been so sweet. I mean, he is just so great in crisis mode. You two are back together? Right. I forgot you saw the famous Pi Sig-party fight. I felt awful. I just left Dick at the party to go see Tim. I had to beg. But he forgave me. Excuse me for asking, but why Tim? It'll sound twisted, but Tim takes care of me. He's like my dad that way. Okay, then. So how did Tim react in the moment you told him? I didn't tell him. He found out. We got back to my place one night, and there was this balloon bouquet from my parents. "Congrats from Grandma and Grandpa" Any other guy would have lost it, but Tim offered to marry me. Your parents sent balloons? Turns out our family doctor's not the firmest believer in the whole... doctor/patient confidentiality. Which, um... kind of changed the equation in terms of keeping the baby or not... 'cause my parents are pretty religious. And then, you know, Tim wanted me to keep the baby. I'll see what I can find out. Just please, Veronica, don't let Tim know I hired you. I would feel horrible if he even thought for a second that I didn't trust him. Jeans! Bold choice. I hope the maitre d' is fashion-forward. Did you and Madison have sex during winter break? - I asked you point black. - And I lied. Point-blank. It wasn't information that you had a right to know. I knew you wouldn't be able to deal with the Madison thing. Which thing are you talking about? The "she roofied me" thing or the thing when I stumbled to my car in the morning, wondering where my virginity was, and she'd written "slut" on my windshield? Was that what you thought I couldn't deal with? I am so genuinely sick right now. If I could have eaten anything today, I'd be throwing up all over your floor. We were broken up at the time. You know how I feel about her. There's no way that, at some point while it was happening, that you weren't thinking about how much I'd hate you being with her. - It wasn't like that. - No? Do you want another variation? 'Cause I've got a million sickening scenarios running on a loop right now. - I wasn't trying to hurt you. - Oh. Really? Imagine if you tried. What do you want me to do? What can I do? Make it not true? Get it out of my head and never let me think about it again? 'Cause... unless you can do that, this is something I'm never getting past. Hello Mr. Mars! I was out dog-walking, and I thought of a question I wanted to ask. - You know we're only ten blocks away? - No, I didn't. I thought I'd save myself a phone call. There seems to be a discrepancy in the police report concerning your husband's death. I mean, knowing the sheriff, I'm sure it's a mistake. What did you find? It says a minivan was parked in Cyrus' spot the night he was killed My daughter told me he normally drove an old Volvo? He did. The minivan's mine. We traded cars for the weekend. Cyrus needed the van to haul his son's drum kit around while I was out of town. Would you like some coffee? Oh, I'm afraid he wouldn't stand for it. In another thirty seconds, he's gonna pull my arm out of the socket if we don't get moving. But, uh, thanks for the info, and, uh, I'll keep you posted on what I find. The best way to forget about your own problems? Dive into someone else's. So, Bonnie Capistrano tells me you knocked her up and blew her off. Yeah, whatever happened with that? You do your hair like that to cover up the three sixes on your scalp, right? I told her to get a paternity test. I'm not here to help her turn a profit. I just feel like you have this... wadded-up Maxim magazine where your heart is supposed to be. Oh, I'm heartless? First Duncan, now Logan. You're running out of rich bachelors' heads to mess with. Is it some kind of weird sport for you, you know, breaking dudes' hearts? What, you put another notch on your lipstick case? Logan slept with Madison when you guys were in Aspen. And? Sorry, Dick, I probably shouldn't have... What, me worry? Can we be done? I've got things to do. Redheaded things. Nadia! There's my big, dumb blonde. It must be a liberating thing not to be cursed with a moral compass. Hi! Is Bonnie here? She's still at class. You're Veronica? Bonnie told me about you. I'm Bonnie's roommate, Phyllis. Come on in. Wow! Raiders of the Lost Dorm room! Oh, yeah. God, Bonnie would love that. Her dream is to be the female Indiana Jones. She can spend three hours watching a documentary on people digging up a tooth. So... you know what happened to Bonnie? Yeah. Bonnie and I have been best friends since seventh grade. Not much happens in our lives that we don't share. What do you think about Bonnie getting back with Tim? I hated the arrogant little toad from the first time she introduced him. Don't hold back, Phyllis. I've kind of turned a corner on Tim, though. The boy came through in the clutch. He found out about the baby, and he stepped up. He bought her What to Expect When You're Expecting. He got her, like, prenatal vitamins. So he was handing her pills? - Could he- - There's no way it was Tim. He offered to marry her. He was gonna talk to her dad and everything, and you know how intimidating that would be. Yeah, Bonnie said her family is pretty religious. - Do you not know about her dad? - Should I? $5,000... ...and if there's only one thing you got to remember, - There's Papa Capistrano. - it's this... He's on all the time. - God may hate the sin, but god loves you. - Amen. - Say it to yourself. God loves you. - God loves you. Bonnie's a preacher's daughter. How very Footloose. Unless Tim was able to convince a gynaecologist he was a pregnant female, I'm betting he scored the RU-486 online. If I can't question Tim, maybe his computer will give me some answers. Sometimes when things don't work out the way a girl wants them to, there's nothing quite as satisfying as the hissy fit. Oh, I hate this stupid day! Are you okay? No. This is, like, the worst day ever of my entire life. I was supposed to meet my brother at his office, and he's not here. And he's not picking up his cell, and he's not even my brother anyway because my parents just told me I'm adopted. - Is this his office? - Huh, huh. Thanks. You've been so helpful. It's so much easier letting the twitch of a man's lip tell you... he's guilty than relying on him to not empty the cache on his hard drive... or trying to figure out his password. Onto plan B. The only thing worse than being up all night obsessing over Madison Sinclair is knowing how much she'd enjoy it. If I have to see this one more time, I'm having my frontal lobe removed. Good. You're up. I've got a little conundrum. Nish says she egged the dean's Volvo on campus the night he was murdered. Mindy says she had the Volvo parked at the Neptune Grand all night. Any guess on who's lying? Both of them? I don't know. Your lack of opinion concerns me. Logan and I broke up. Again. My idea this time. Ah, I'm sorry. - You doing okay? - No. No, no, no, no, no. Good night. I'm in a hurry, Veronica. I know you enjoy screwing with me, but it's kind of losing its charm. I have no idea what you're talking about. I checked my grade online. It said I got a B. You and I both know I got an A. I entered an A. You were looking at someone else's grade. Like I didn't look carefully. Either you did this on purpose, or you messed up the entry. Why didn't you print out a grade report, hmm? I shouldn't have to. I should have the grade I earned. Veronica. Yes? My space... your space. Ah, here it is. An A, Like I said. Huh. Maybe I was looking at someone else's grade. If there is a justification for my actions right now, it's this: I have gone completely crazy. When I'm lying in bed and I can't sleep because of visions of Madison and Logan rolling around. She wins. When I've got her in my sights, I'm in control. How does it empower you, Veronica, to know Madison brings her laundry home from USC each weekend? Shut up, sane Veronica. I'm in charge now. Surprise! Aah! Oh, my god! And watching her get a new Mercedes for her birthday... very healing. At least it's reminded me that I need to buy Mac a present. Oh! Thank you! Gotzmine. You win, crazy Veronica. She's all yours. My space... your space. His password is "Dick Tracy"? Aw. That is adorable. Okay, Tim, let's see where were you browsing three weeks ago? Nothing, nothing, nothing. Neptune clinic? Whoa. O'Dell - suicide? Tim's investigating the dean's death? Forensics - Suspects - Witnesses Anthony Martin? There's no Anthony Martin mentioned in the police report. Earwitness. Heard shot while walking home from Pi Sigma party. Witness was drunk. Couldn't determine time of death. FOR A GOOD TIME CALL... Did you hook up with Madison? I did. It just happened, you know. I didn't think you had any feelings left over her. It's still uncool. You don't do that to a buddy. And by the way, you laying in here in the dark is pathetic. I have an appointment to discuss my options at the clinic Tim contacted. In the meantime, a little spiritual advisement wouldn't hurt. GODZLUVV Exhibit A on why I don't trust TV preachers. Carl, did you pack up those TCP forms? Can I help you, miss? Sorry, it's kind of personal. Well, if you're here to see if your skirt is long enough, the answer is "no." Ah, I'm an old fogy. Actually, you know, you kind of caught us at a bad time. What is it, Thurman? It's nothing, Ted. This young lady was... Hester. I was hoping you could help me. I can always try. So... what can I do for you? I'm pregnant, and now I don't know what to do. Well, I can't imagine you came in here thinking that I was going to say anything other than... that you should keep your baby. Yeah, I guess. Just... my parents will never understand. They'll disown me. Oh, I wouldn't be too sure about that. The promise of a grandchild is a powerful thing. Yeah, if I were thirty. I'm sure you wouldn't be thrilled if your teenage daughter came home pregnant. Well... Actually... I was. My daughter is about your age, and she became pregnant. You know what her mother and I did? We celebrated. But our desire to meet our grandchild... far outweighed any regrets about the circumstances of the pregnancy. Maybe your parents will surprise you. Reverend Ted? I'm... I'm sorry. She lost her baby. So... You think your friend was slipped RU-486? Yeah, and this is the only place to get it locally. That's an awful story. I'm thinking it could be one of the guys she thought might be the father. Is there any scenario... where a guy could come in and say it was for his wife or girlfriend? Not on my watch. So, if a girl comes in and says she wants RU-486... She would take it here in the office. No exceptions. Is it possible... for someone to hide it under her tongue or palm it, make it out of here with the pill? I guess. Anything's possible. Is there any way you could tell me... who came into the clinic between Thursday- You don't really expect me to say "yes," do you? - Had to ask. - Okay. NEPTUNE WOMEN'S CLINIC Hello? Anthony. Just the guy I wanted to hear from. I am absolutely a good time. So, if I understand correctly, you got pretty blitzed at the Pi Sig party, and you wandered back to your dorm room late. You passed the administration building, and that's when you hear the gunshot. That about sums it up. Why didn't you report it? Report what? A guy shoot himself, I read it in the paper the next day, and I was like, "oh, that's what that was." Besides... I don't need another alcohol infraction on my record. So, how did Tim Foyle find you? Is he a friend of yours? Never met the guy. I guess I told a bunch of people when I realized what I had heard. It must have gotten back to him. How'd you find out? I found out from Tim. So, what did he want to know? You know. What I heard, what I saw, and what time it was. And what did you tell him? I didn't see anything, I heard a gunshot, and I had no idea what time it was. Okay. Well, if you think of anything... Wait! I just remembered. I turned on Space Ghost. Terry Jones was the guest. They went on about spam. According to the website, they re-run Space Ghost at 2:30. It probably takes ten minutes to stumble from the administration building back to the dorm. Oh, you sought me out. That can only mean one thing. You need a favour. Is it a favour if it's something we both would enjoy? Remember you told my criminology class about how you stole some guy's car and had it crushed? Yeah. Why? Maybe I was thinking about having someone's car stolen and crushed. Oh. What happened? You broke up with Logan? Good for you. I'd be happy to have Logan's car crushed. What's he driving? Not his. A little Mercedes at this address. You can't miss it. The plates read "gotzmine." Wow. I'm surprised somebody hasn't crushed it already. Whose is it? Madison Sinclaire. From high school... I remember. She lost a hubcap and told the principal I stole it for drug money. So, you want her car cubed or- - Thank you so much. - Oh, no problem. And the next time I need some literature compared, I know you'll be there for me. Okay. Now, this has nothing to do with you and Logan, right? Did I come here for therapy or to get a car stolen and cubed? "Gotzmine," huh? Yeah. I have been wondering if I still have the touch. And, uh, it's gonna cost you five hundred. That is the going rate, isn't it? - Hey dad! - Hey honey. So, I found out something on the O'Dell case. There was a guy who heard the shot around 2:20. What? Is there anything maybe you want to tell me? About what? Well, I found this in our mailbox today. "Dear Sir, the enclosed photographs were taken... at Neptune Women's Clinic, which performs abortions." I can't believe these people. They sit up in a building with their telephoto lens and take pictures of people in their most private, personal moments. That's disgusting. Uh, honey, that's how we pay the rent. - It's different. - I like to think so. Back on point. Is everything okay? Does this have something to do with you and Logan? No... No! Dad, no. I am not now, nor have I ever been, pregnant. I visited the clinic for a case. Someone slipped this girl RU-486, and it caused a miscarriage. - That's awful. - Yeah. Where did this come from? There's no return address. No postage. "Does everyone go to heaven?" Actually, what does it say? I've got intro to theology next semester. Mmm. Doesn't look like it. Well, here's a bookmark if you can't make it all the way through. "Good Word Press, San Diego." Harassing women in crisis since 1973. You think... maybe you want to get all up in their "bid'ness"? Yeah? Who are you? My name is Carson Drew, and this is my assistant, Nancy. We're trying to find who published this. You found him. Eddie Nettles. Mr. Nettles, some of your materials ended up in a packet sent anonymously- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I told you people before, this here's my constitutional right. If you have a problem, see my lawyer. We're private investigators working on a rather delicate matter. You see, our clients... their son is engaged to a girl who... well... They don't know much about her, so they asked us to look into... They suspect that the bride-to-be may have misled the groom regarding past indiscretions. They heard she recently terminated a pregnancy at the Neptune free clinic. I know. And if it's true, the parents want their son to know. Is there any way you could point us in the direction of the person who took the photos? Man, this world, huh? I got them. There's the binders there. The photos are arranged chronologically. You're free to take a look. - Hey, Edward, how's it going? - Thurman. Just put them with the others, huh? Who are these folks? This is Carson Drew and his assistant... what's your assistant's name? Nancy. They're lying to you, Eddie. She came into our office yesterday calling herself Hester, claiming she was troubled. She really is troubled. Well, we've done better. "Godzluvv." Tasteful. We did okay. How so? One of the girls in the photo binder. I've seen her with Dick. The Casablancas kid? Who might have been the father. Wow. Impressive. I hear "Modern Breasts" is a really hard class. The rebound starts with me? Nice! That redhead from the other day, Nadia. Does she have a last name? Comaneci. What? Dick, do you think I'm an idiot? Nadia Comaneci is an Olympic gymnast from Romania. You sure? I mean, she doesn't have an accent. Don't play dumb, Dick. Some girl I see you hugging on pops up... at the women's clinic a week after Bonnie told you she's pregnant? I have to ask. Was she picking something up for you? Hopefully a box of sponges. Look, if we're not gonna have an empty sexual encounter, I kind of got stuff to do, so... Yeah. - Hi. Are you Nadia Fassano? - Yeah. Thank goodness. I had to go through the whole freshman facebook and flirt with the registrar to get your schedule. Okay. Why? 'Cause I wanted to talk to you, but your pal Dick wouldn't give me your real name. - I have a pal named Dick? - Dick Casablancas. Nadia, I know you know him. I saw the two of you walking together, and when I asked about you, he told me your last name was Comaneci. - I just want to know- - Okay, that Dick. Yeah, um, I got drunk at a party, and I made out with him for like five seconds, and then I gave him a fake name. What? Would you want him calling you? Hello? Hi. Keith, um, i-it's Mindy O'Dell. Listen, can you come right away? Uh, there's someone in the house downstairs. Where are you? I'm in my bedroom. I'm with the boys. You call the cops? You're closer, and you're competent. Keith, hurry, please. Good morning Mr. Batando. You might want to dial the cops now. Yeah. Yeah. Give 'em a call. I'm sure they'd love to hear about all the fun and games my ex has been up to, and you, too, Mars: accessory to kidnapping, stealing my bone marrow. The sheriff'd love to hear all about that. No one made you sign that settlement, Steve. You got money and a Porsche. Which they just repo'ed. She stopped the payments... to me and on the car. I was just taking what she owed. Since Cyrus died, I haven't been able to afford it. Dad? Hey, there's my boy. Come here. Mom and Dad were just going over some stuff. I think I should get going. Now, maybe next week we go see a Laker game and... and, uh, I'll see if I can get my hands on some tickets. There's that vase. Okay, time to go to bed. Okay? Let's go. What do you want? Just checking to see if everything's okay. Everything's awesome. Well, he seems... I'm not sure if "okay" is the word, but... Yeah, long story. You know Cyrus was considering sending him to a teen-discipline school? But I don't even know if that would work. Well, I should get going. If he comes by again, you should really call the cops. People with his kind of problem can... uh, be more trouble than you realise. Yeah, "problem"? Which problem? Back when I was sheriff, I saw my share of meth heads. Yeah, I know. He's been in and out of rehab. Goodnight, Mrs. O'Dell. Actually, um... would you mind staying, just until I check on Jason? My nerves are still a little jangled. You mind if I pour myself a drink? My nerves are a bit frayed myself. No, anything you can find is yours. Keith? Growing up, my parents would keep the adult beverages in a fridge out in the garage. Yeah, well, we keep ours in the kitchen. Oh. It's Veronica. Leave a message. Ah! Veronica's voice mail! So, where are you, Veronica? Out digging through someone's trash, maybe? Interrogating one of your friends? Beating out a confession? You know, if you dig deep enough, you're gonna find that everyone's a sinner. Judge not, Veronica, et cetera, et cetera. All right, stay on message, Logan. Okay, honestly... it's encouraging... that someone still has such high expectations of me. Veronica, I would give anything if I could take back that night in Aspen. I'm sorry it causes you so much pain. I'm sorry it happened. I really love you, Veronica. And how are you this a.m.? Cramming for philosophy. Have you seen my copy of Either/Or? No, but I've got an old issue of Buts you can have. The comedy styling of Keith Mars, ladies and gentlemen. Hey, look, it's that guy from the printing office. Apparently the preacher's leaving cable access for the big-time. That guy Thurman is the ministry's CFO? Should a ministry have a CFO? You don't think he did it, do you? He struck me as being aggressively pro-life. How do you think a televangelist with a pregnant, unmarried daughter would play to his flock? A fly in the collection plate, perhaps? Bonnie, hey, it's Veronica. Hey. So, what have you heard? Are you making any progress? Yeah, it's coming along. Do you know Thurman Randolph very well? - He works for... - My dad, yeah. - You trust him? - Not really. I want to search his office during today's service. Can you get me in? If you can get here in fifteen minutes. Do you have church clothes? So, I'm heading out. New voice mail Ah! Ah! Veronica's voice mail! So, where are you, Veronica? Out digging through someone's trash... Something wrong, honey? - No, just... - Message erased. old crap. I got to run. Hello? Hey, it's me. So, if you want to see German engineering reduced to a cube, come by the yard this afternoon around 2:00. I'll be there right after church. Thanks, Weevil. Bye. Church? Hello. Hi. I didn't know you knew Bonnie. We only met recently. Oh, hi. You two met? We did. Hester didn't tell me the two of you were friends. Hester? I, uh, hope you're well. Reverend Ted! How's my other daughter? Are you ready to celebrate? You look like you lost a little weight. Well, three thousand regular parishioners, each with their own cheesecake recipe. I finally had to clamp down. You mean vomit. Bonnie. I think Tim slipped you the RU-486. What?! Bonnie? What is she- Why do you say it was Tim? This bookmark is... a gift, sent by a pro-life group to everyone who comes out of the Neptune clinic. It's the only clinic in the area that provides RU-486. It's some sort of a shame campaign. I just found it in the pregnancy book Tim gave you. By the way, your CFO works with the same group. Somebody slipped you... Bonnie, why didn't you tell- Phyllis. Bonnie? Tim didn't give me that book. Phyllis did. Bonnie, let me explain... I did it for you. Do you really think those guys were worthy of you, of being the father of your baby? And think what it would have meant. All of your plans, all of your goals? No career at all, just divorce and a baby to support, and you have dreams, Bonnie. And I was trying to help you. I know you. You wanted to give up the baby, and you were going to until your parents found out. Bonnie... - Bonnie, I'm so... - Sorry? You're sorry? Get out! I can't look at you right now! I want you out of my sight! - Bonnie... - Bonnie! - Go to hell! Go to hell! - Bonnie! That's enough! It's done. She didn't mean to hurt you. She didn't mean to. Try to be forgiving. It's the only way. Anger will tear you down. It'll make you less of the person that you want to be. And it will tear apart your soul. The bible teaches us that he who is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he who rules his spirit can capture a city. He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who is quick-tempered exalts folly. So, we're all set to go as soon as they finish. I even washed it so it'd be shiny when we crush it. I know it doesn't sound logical, but trust me, it's much better. Let's not do it. Are you sure? 'Cause, you know, I did go through all the trouble of stealing it. Here's a little something for the effort. Maybe you could open a can of tuna, set it inside her A/C vent, then park it back on the block. I can do that. Yeah. You're going soft, Mars.
