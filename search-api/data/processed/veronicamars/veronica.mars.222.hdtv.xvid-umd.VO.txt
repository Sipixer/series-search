Woody's a pervert. He's sick. What he did to us is wrong. Two of the boys who died in the bus crash were on Woody's little-league team. Most adults keep their hands off of other people's children. You'll be the guy who let a child molester and a murderer get away! Woody's gone. He took his private plane. My grandmother asked me for one thing my whole life. She wants to see me walk across that stage at graduation. It's Weevil! I'm telling you! He set me up! I got something on you. Bless me, father, for I have sinned. I've got what? Chlamydia. Jackie left for France this morning. I thought our story was epic. I have to go. I don't want to lose you from my life. My stepmom - she's a gold digger. You're cash-strapped. I can help. But quid pro quo, mrs. C., Quid pro quo. We find the defendant not guilty. See, this is how it is. The innocent suffer, the guilty go free, and truth and fiction are pretty much interchangeable. Mr. Echolls, how do you feel about your acquittal? I feel... relieved to have my name cleared of this... horrible crime. There is neither a Santa Claus nor an easter bunny, and there are no angels watching over us. Things just happen for no reason. And nothing makes any sense. We will not do this. You can't let this stick in your head. However wrong it turned out, it's done. We're people with lives, and we will not obsess. We move on. Aaron Echolls will get his justice in his own way. You really believe that? Yes. Now, come on. We're running a business here. Look alive. What happened to moving on? Posted today. Meg's dad offering 20 grand for the capture of Woody Goodman. Well, I'm sure someone will get him. Didn't you say something about "we have a business to run"? Shouldn't you be out hunting him down like the dog he is? I also said something about us being people with lives. See, I have this kid who's gonna graduate from high school. I don't want to miss it. This is Woody Goodman. He blew up a bus and molested children. Guess I'm just sentimental. When the management gives you free cake, you're supposed to eat it. I thought you were prepared for Jackie going. Never figured it would go down like this. She left you a note? "But I was afraid if I saw you, I wouldn't be able to get on the plane. I'll always... " well, then it's just a bunch of private stuff. What can you do about that? You could use a method time-tested by women throughout the ages - Gorge on cake. I'll be right back. Johnny Ludden. Thanks for dropping by. Sure. Free gelato just to show up - why not? Is this you on Woody's old team? Yeah. So, do I have to eat here, or can I get the gelato in the carton? Just a few more questions first. Hey, honey. Hey, dad. Hello? You've got a call... from Vinnie Van Lowe. So... of course you know about the bounty on this Goodman guy. I'm aware of it, yes. 20 g's? That's big-boy money. Gonna be a lot of top guys out there for it. I had a thought. We team up. Mars and Van Lowe. Pool our resources. Split the cash. Sheriff got you on video breaking into Woody's house. But "Johnny Law" don't know what I got. What do you got? All his records - tax, medical, corporate - the whole enchilada. We nail him, we split 60-40. I'm the 60, by the way. 50-50... if the stuff you got pans out, and no action until after my daughter's graduation. I'm in jail. I deserve 60. I risk my life to bring a fugitive to justice, and you're giving me world's tiniest violin. Guess I'm just heartless. He's got, like, 10 credit cards in different corporate names. We're gonna have to put a trace on all of them. And he has a pilot's license. Seasonal allergies, bad arches. And he had the clap. Treated twice for chlamydia. Didn't see that in his campaign materials. - Bingo. Heart arrhythmia. - So that's our strategy - just wait for him to drop dead? He has to take a pill every day. Is there any way you can find out Gia Goodman's cellphone access code? Gia's cell? Woody's lawyer is also an old college buddy of his. If he'd call anyone, it would be him. If we had Gia's code and could forward her calls... I guarantee you she hasn't changed it from the factory default. Then I have a plan. Up and at 'em, honey. Can you believe the big day is finally here? There she is. The eyes are bright, the tail is bushy. Pancakes, mom? Are you trying to give me an early jump on the freshman 15? Eat up. You think the dining halls at San Diego state are gonna feed you like this? Mmm... I love pancakes! What, a comment? "Get a room"? You just gagged in your mouth? No. It's nice. - Are you okay? - All right. So, how's the sheriff business? Pretty sweet. We got Otis sleeping it off in cell one, and Lamb has to wear the clete the crime-fighting canine costume to all the elementary schools this week. Listen, after the ceremony, don't run off with that boy because we want to take pictures... and lots of them. And I can't wait. Okay, then you should practice. Say "cheese. " Cheese! They gave me the wrong cap and gown. Yeah, how exactly can you tell? It's got someone else's name on it? Guess who's going commando? Must we? Does anyone know Wallace Fennel? I do. He was in my P.E. Class. Awesome baller. I think he works at sac-n-pac. Awesome baller - that doesn't really help me. Can you point him out? You didn't hear what happened to him? Sac-n-pac got held up when he was working. The robber forced him into the walk-in cooler. He got frostbite. Yeah. Dude lost three fingers. Oh, my god, that's awful. Sweetie, I love you, but you have to be the most gullible girl I've ever met. I'm trusting. Sue me. There he is. That's Wallace. Wallace? Wallace. - Wallace? - Yeah? I think I have your cap and gown. - That must make you Veronica Mars? - It does. So, looking forward to getting out of here? I guess. I don't know. High school was a blast, right? Oh, you're one of those. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Have a good life. I'm sure you will. Lilly? Hey! Tell me about everything. Tell me about this new guy. Tell me about Vassar. The guy is gone. We had a little disagreement over fooling around with his ex. - That bastard. - Oh, no, no, it was, um, it was me. I kind of fooled around with his ex. I mean, you'd think that guys would dig that, right? What? It's college. It's expected. You'll see. God, it's so good to see you. What is this? A Lilly Kane memorial fountain? Uh... Do you smell bacon? Graduation day! Get up! Lots to do! I'm making breakfast. A long time ago, Alucardo : ~></i> We used to be friends but I BLueBeRRy : ~></i> Haven't thought of you lately at all.

Morning, mr. Lee. Gia Goodman asked you to call her on her cell. It's all right. I got the number. Gia? Bill Lee. Hey, so, I'm trying to get a message to dad, but he didn't leave us a forwarding... It's just, we got a call from dr. Hoover, and I guess his heart pills are 50 milli-something this time, instead of 100, so he has to take two. It's really important. Got it, Gia. I'll see what I can do. Take care, honey. Quail Creek lodge? I need to leave a message for mr. Underhill, please. Bingo. After you talked to Woody's lawyer, he immediately called a number for Quail Creek lodge, 20 miles outside of Reno. It's a stocked hunting ranch. Rich businessmen shooting captive birds. You think Woody's there? I checked google earth. Satellite photos show a landing strip and a building big enough to hold a plane. I'm on a flight to Reno leaving an hour after graduation. I don't know if I like the idea of you running around a place full of armed, drunk businessmen. That's why I rarely go to Texas. I'll be fine. I'll call as soon as I have him. John Enbram. Wallace Fennel. - Guess what? - What? Beaver got us a room at the Neptune Grand for tonight. Ooh-la-la! Any advice? Close your eyes and think of England? Just relax. - Phil Climmer. - Yo Climmer! Eli Navarro, you're under arrest in connection with the murder of Eduardo Orozco. No, man. You have the right to remain silent. Not here. - Anything you say... - just give me 10 minutes, okay? You have the right to an attorney. - If you cannot afford an - - just let me graduate! ...One may be appointed for you. Do you understand these rights? Please don't do this, man. Cuff him. Let's get him out of here. Hey, hey. You want to do this the hard way, huh? Let's go. Cindy Mackenzie. Scott Markham. Veronica Mars. Yes! Yes! You were expecting some other reaction? I - I can't decide if my life is gonna be easier or more difficult with you gone. Anything I should know in case I get another one like you someday? Don't keep all your passwords taped on the bottom of your stapler. And stay cool, mr. C. For you on this momentous occasion. A pony?! New York? We leave Tuesday. Broadway? Soho? The Moma? Yankee stadium, Shea stadium, Madison Square garden. Oh, thank you so much! This is awesome! Oh! Awesome. Now go catch Woody. I get creeped out just knowing he's out there somewhere. Alright. You have fun tonight. That's the plan. Put on your dancing shoes, Mars, 'cause tonight we're gonna upchuck the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat. - "Upchuck"? - You heard me. Veronica, do you know about this? I don't. What's wrong? Wallace left this note for me on my windshield. He's booked himself a flight to Paris. He's gonna try to track down Jackie. Mommy! Mommy! You're 10 minutes late. Cut me some slack, ma. I haven't even been back two days. Jackie, you ain't in Neptune no more. Terrence Cook fantasy camp is over. This is real life. Brooklyn Dan's? Yeah. Hold on. It's for you. Hello? What, no "Bonjour"? Veronica? How did you know? Well, first, 3.1 G.P.A. doesn't scream the Sorbonne. And the Java job - you're a mighty good service-industry worker for the daughter of a model living on the upper west side who never held a job before. I've known for a while. Look, I might have lied about my life, but I swear I never lied to Wallace about how I felt. Whatever you told him, it really did the trick because he just got on a plane to Paris. But the good news is he has a 4-hour layover at JFK, so you can go tell him the truth before he's forced to endure several ugly days of rude waiters for nothing. Hello, Logan. What are you doing here? Well, I need a place to stay. How are the suites? Well, probably an improvement over your previous digs. Might be a little weird, though. I don't think any of the other guests killed anyone. You know... you should really make more of an effort to be civil to me now, Logan. Why? Because you beat a murder rap and suddenly you're my father again? No, Logan. I never stopped being your father, and I never will. But I got the purse strings back. You're my dependent again, son. - Going down? - No. Up. Marijuana? Sure got ourselves in a heap of trouble this time, cousin.</i> You got that right. Boss is gonna throw the book at us.</i> Not to mention the federal government. When we break our probation, we sure do a bang-up job of it. We ought to be out of prison about in time to collect social security.</i> It ain't funny, luke. We got to get ourselves out of this. Ow! Information? Yeah, can you put me through to the local sheriff's department? Thanks. So, you used me. Someone blackmails you, and you use me to set up the whole girl-in-the-motel thing. Incorporation dies, and your special secrets stay hidden. Keith, I know how this must look. If you're about to insist this is all some big misunderstanding, Woody, I kind of think you don't. I didn't crash the bus. I could never have hurt all those kids. I don't know, Woody. The welfare of children doesn't seem to have been terribly high on your list. That's not how it was. It wasn't that way at all. Those boys - if you knew their fathers, how they ignored them, mistreated them. They needed someone. I listened to them. I cared about them. Woody, just stop. Mr. Mars, they're ready. You caught him. Loading him onto his own plane as we speak. As soon as the pilot gets here, we'll be homeward bound. Did he confess to the crash? Unfortunately, he insists that he didn't do it, so we're gonna need a lot more evidence to nail him. I'm still trying to find that third kid from the tape. I've got everyone on the team identified except one guy. I think I know where to find him, though. The pilot just got here. I'll be in late, so don't wait up. See you in the morning, honey. Derek Applegate. Who are you, and where do you live? Oh, god. Pick up, pick up, pick up. It's Mac. Leave a message. Mac, it's Veronica. You have to get away from Beaver. Do whatever you have to do, but get away from him. He's dangerous. Call me when you hear this. A listing for Hart Hanson? Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! Oh! That's what I'm talking about! Feels good to be a man from time to time, does it not? - Yes. - Enbom, get over here! All I ask is that you don't follow that performance with a belch. Do you want to go check out the room? It's liquid. It's courage. It's liquid courage. Yeah, well, there's, uh, there's nothing up there that I'm afraid of. Did you hear? Veronica's dad caught the mayor. It's all over the news. They're flying him out tonight on Woody's plane. That sleezoid is gonna fry - bzzzz! Hey. Have you seen Beaver and Mac? Yeah, they were here earlier. What's wrong? I think Beaver - - What? - Where's your brother? I think he took "Ghost World" up to his room. They're probably up there making love... or playing dungeons and dragons... or both at the same time. They're both, like, 12th-level dorks... just saying... Don't worry about it. I'm having a good time, and we've got all night, okay? We're cool here. I'm just gonna hop in the shower, and then we can head back down to the party. Can you tell me which room Cassidy Casablancas is in? I'm sorry. We can't give out that information. I can ring his room, if you'd like. Sure. I'm sorry. There's a "do not disturb" on the room. Damn it. Hello, Veronica. Well, don't look so surprised. It's a small town. Now that I'm no longer in jail, we might just run into each other from time to time. I'll have to pay better attention to where I'm going, then. Well, it's a free country. Those founding fathers were really onto something. Freedom - ah! - It's pretty damn sweet. I like it. So did Lilly. Bummer you murdered her. You know, I can see why the two of you were such good friends. You're so much alike. Not afraid to speak your minds. You know, that just might be the best part about the day I smashed her head in with an ashtray - knowing that, once and for all, she would finally shut the hell up. Ah. Well... have a nice night, Veronica. Mac? Hey, Veronica! Where's Mac? A better place. Unfortunately, she never got a chance to read your message. Now... throw me your bag. I said throw me your bag! So, "Beaver's a killer"? That's a pretty serious accusation. What exactly do you think you know? You played for Woody's little-league team with Marcos and Peter. He molested all three of you. They wanted to come forward. A couple of the Sharks had to know about it. They'll come forward. Things like this don't stay secret. Damn right. Yeah, but I mean do you guys really want people to know about it? He's a pervert. He's sick. And what he did to us is wrong. Look, please don't drag me into this. You're already in it. You'll thank us later. Peter and Marcos were going to spill. That's why they had to die. My guess? You got the explosives from Curly Moran. I saw you with that sophomore Hart Hanson last week. Hart says you worked on his war movies with him, that you were in charge of blowing things up. He said you knew a guy who taught you how to do it - your dad's mechanic, former stunt coordinator Curly Moran, right? Admit it, man, you're way happier in the limo than sitting on the bus, getting eye daggers in the back from meg. I'd have been happier if you hadn't had that chili dog. Curly told Weevil that he knew who blew up the bus. He figured it out, didn't he? That's why you needed him gone. You know Cervando's been bragging about hustling Liam Fitzpatrick, so you convinced the P.C.H.Ers that Curly blew up the bus. Yo! - Come on, man, let's go! - Come on, man! But you have to finish the job. Tell me. Tell it's me by the clamor, now, baby! You wanted to focus any investigation in a new direction. You knew I was a key witness in the Aaron Echolls trial, so... Convenient, wasn't it? The road hog's cliffside location? Easy to dump the body. You didn't hire me to catch Kendall cheating on your dad, did you? You knew what he was up to, and you wanted to punish him for the way he treated you. You used me to do it. And you were marvelous. Now let me ask you something. How is it I got Chlamydia? Woody was treated for it. I ended up with it. Shelly Pomroy's party, sophomore year. You said Dick pushed you into a room with me after I'd been roofied, but you didn't run out like you said you did, did you? Nope. You wanted to prove you were a man. It helped that I was unconscious, didn't it? Easy to imagine whatever it is you needed to imagine. You raped me! And Dick still thinks I'm a virgin. See, I know how to keep a secret. That's what this is all about, isn't it - keeping your secret? Well, it's over. It's out. I know. Yeah, but I have a pretty good feeling that you won't be telling anybody. I already did. I told my dad. He knows. That's, uh, that's too bad. He's on Woody's plane with him, right? Right now on his way back? See, because I have no more use for Woody. You heard about the bomb in Woody's car, right? Yeah, 'cause there's one on his plane, and all I have to do... is dial. Want to call your dad, say goodbye before I press send, go ahead. I'll give you a minute. Cassidy, no, you're not serious. 56... 55... ticktock. Pick up. Please pick up. Daddy. Well. What do you know? Yeah, sorry about that. I know this might be a bad time to ask for a favor. How would you feel now that you've got nothing left to live for about just rolling yourself off? I really don't want your DNA all over my shirt. In a minute, Kalee. Daddy's on the phone. I'm gonna be in your neighborhood with my daughter.</i> How about we, um, drop by? That way our daughters can meet. Uh... your - well, my place is a mess.</i> I sure like this thing. Ever wonder what it feels like to the people you actually taser? Let's give it a whirl. What do you say? You know what I was just thinking? We're Neptune pirates, right? This is like I'm making you walk the plank. Except instead of jabbing you with a sword, I'm sending 300,000 volts through you. Now jump. Please don't! You couldn't do this the easy way? You know, Aaron Echolls is staying here. What do you want to bet that I can get him convicted for the death of this teenage girl? No! Logan, move away from him. Veronica, don't. He killed my father! Give me the gun, Veronica. He killed everyone on the bus. He raped me! You are not a killer, Veronica. Give me the gun. You're not a killer, Veronica. Give me the gun. Beaver, don't! My name is Cassidy! Cassidy, don't. Why not? Layin' across a river That's what I thought. See my friends See my friends Layin' across a river She is gone Mac. Mac! And now there's no one left except my friends he took my clothes. He took everything. Why? She just went Oh... my... god. Have I told you how much I love freedom? I like it, too. And any more "freedoming" tonight, and I'm gonna need a wheelchair. Ahh. Well, well, well. Who's that handsome fella? C.W.? It's a done deal. Hey, Wallace. What are you doing here? You heading to Paris? What a coincidence. Me too. I'm not going to Paris. This is for the philly shuttle. Cheapest ticket I could get to bypass security. I need to tell you some things, Wallace. I never lived on the upper west side. My mom isn't a model. She's a waitress... who had a one-night stand with Terrence 18 years ago. I'm just another kid from Brooklyn who got screwed up on drugs and booze and all the wrong friends, but... by the time I was a sophomore - your past really doesn't matter to me. I have a son, Wallace. He's 2. When he was born, my mom contacted my dad and made a deal. I'd go to California and try to start over, and she'd raise my baby. When my dad just dropped me from his life, I realized that I was being a hypocrite. Here I was, torn up that... I wasn't the center of my dad's universe when my mom was raising my kid 3,000 miles away. I can't be that person, Wallace. I had to come back. And I have to stay. And your life is in Neptune, and you have to go. - You're stinky. - No you are stinky. No, you're stinky. He means stinky. Both stinky. You're stinky! Honk! Honk! Honey, do you smell that? You know what that is? I smell bacon. Dad? Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Was that breakfast I smell? You're alive! Oh, I thought you were dead! I love you so much. Oh, honey, what's wrong? I don't understand. Woody's plane - Cassidy Casablancas blew it up. Oh, honey.. I wasn't on the plane. Lamb didn't want me arriving with Woody getting met by the press, so he had them take me off the plane at the last minute. I ran to the car. I drove home. I was a little surprised to find, you know, Logan on the couch, but it was better than finding him elsewhere, right? What were you saying about the Casablancas boy? It's most likely going to be ruled a suicide, so insurance-wise, that's going to be a wash. The cops found these in Cassidy's room, however. Phoenix Land Trust. It's all in your name. - I assume the - - Right. Phoenix, the real-estate thing. How am I doing these days? $8 million and change. Tell him I said, "nice going. " Him? Betting against incorporation? Ballsy. Feels like a Richard Casablancas move to me. I can feel it already. The little-town blues are melting away. You all packed? Vagabond shoes and all. And pepper spray - for if we run into that Trump character. You sure you don't want to drive with the old man? Logan is giving me a ride. We're supposed to "talk. " How'd he take, um, what happened? Shrugs it off, calls himself little orphan Annie, which I think means "badly. " I should go out front. I should get my autograph book. Carol Channing is still alive, isn't she? I'll see you at the gate. So? What are you doing here? I'm not gonna see you for a whole week. That's, like, months. Yeah, but then I'll be back, and everything will be fine. Swing from the ceiling You say that, but I don't know. - I know. I can feel it. - And you're never wrong? No? Aw... young love. No, no, hold that position. Norman Rockwell wants to come in and paint you two. Did he pin on his pin, or was he too shy? Why are you here? Yeah, I didn't know you could come out during daylight hours. I have a business proposition for your father. Okay, but I'm warning you. He doesn't carry much cash. I need you to do something for me. Well, I'll be back in a week, and at that time, I will - I need it right now. Sorry, mrs. Casablancas, but I'm meeting my daughter in an hour. I think you'll change your mind. Oh. Like I said, it's important. [Paul Westerberg "Time Flies Tomorrow"] Time... flies tomorrow And tomorrow will make a day... since we've met. Transcript: Raceman
