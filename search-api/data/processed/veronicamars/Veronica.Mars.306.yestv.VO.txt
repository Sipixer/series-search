- Right. What's your problem? Just that I'm officially failing mechanical engineering. Call this number. It's a tutor. They raped Claire... "The blonde in the middle" I have the ATM photo from that night. The guy who did this to me? I have no idea of who this is. - Is Wang Yi here? - Why? Because he raped this girl. Claire? I doubt it. She's Wang's girlfriend. Dean O'Dell, give me a chance to explain. I don't care what kind of point you're trying to make. Fake a rape, then bring in your lawyer? What universe do you live in? Have you gone completely insane? So, is this what you wanted? You think this is what I wanted. Angela, get them in here. If you examine it closely, dean O'Dell, the facts are still... The facts are miss Mars' story here, and she has the notes and evidence to back it up, I believe. We have photos. We have witnesses. We have the boyfriend who helped. There's no question Claire lied about the rape, and the Hearst charter's quite clear about this. You want to challenge the charter, that's fine. We have lawyers, too, and they're a lot scarier than you, Mr. Davis. Miss Nordhouse, you're expelled from Hearst college as of this moment, and so is your lawyer. That's all. Happy? Madam editor, why didn't I read this story in the Hearst paper? I found the facts fairly simple to corroborate. I felt I had a responsibility to exercise some caution with a story implying the rapes might have been faked. In case you haven't noticed, it's a powder keg out there. I noticed, but I didn't see much caution when you implicated the pi sigma house. You're supposed to at least pretend to be objective. I'm afraid I'm gonna need you to step down as editor of the Free Press. It's a student paper. You can't. I'm a devious old man, Nish. You'd be surprised what I can do. You're done there as of this moment. You'll regret this. And so will you. David, sorry for the wait. It's been a hell of a week. Come on in. Mr. Fennel? This is hardly the first time we've caught an athlete cheating. With Mr. Fennel, I'll take some of the blame. We usually don't take athletes in the program. It's just too demanding, Especially with standardized test scores as low as his. If I'd paid closer attention to... Oh! I'm sorry. Pardon us. My important lunch. There better be a cookie in there. Oh, of course there isn't. Why do you punish me like this? Because I'm your wife. That's what I'm for, remember? Be merciful. She probably ate the damn cookie herself. So, what do you have to say? I'm with her on the mercy thing. The whole of human knowledge right there online, and these papers are thin. Am I crazy to expect better? And if you're confused as to what better is, let me direct you to the front, where I've posted our only example of A-caliber work. Nice job, Ms. Mars. Well, this should make me popular. All righty, that's all for today. We'll see you next time. Don't forget, read both chapters... Both. Professor, I have the Columbia studies. Maybe we can... Just make copies for tomorrow, Tim. Veronica... you free for lunch? Databases, chemistry, psychology... that's where the action is. Are you taking any psych? Take Wagner's class. He's the best. If you want a double major... Double? I haven't even declared one major yet. Consider this a sales talk. I not only think of you as a very bright woman in general, I also think that you're a natural when it comes to criminal work. I'm not saying this to be nice or supportive. I'm saying it because it's true and because I want someone like you in my program. I think I should be your faculty advisor. I think you're capable of great work here, Veronica, and I'd like to help you do it. End of sales talk. He sounds like a hell of a guy. Not only is he smart, but he's the biggest gun in the department, so him offering to be my advisor... Yeah, I'm not surprised. But I wish you would consult with me before you start phasing me out of your life. Dad... He's smart, huh? Is he smarter than your old man? You know, actually, you two have a lot in common. You'd like him. Can I take him in a fight? Be honest. Hello. Keith, hi, it's Harmony. Hi. Uh, is everything okay? Oh, fine, fine, actually. I know that our professional relationship is over, but I enjoyed, you know, talking. Uh, yeah, me too. So, my husband has taken our daughter to Orlando for a couple of weeks. I've got passes to the noir festival at the orient and no one to go with. And I was thinking, you're a guy with an interest in... In... noir business? Right. And maybe you might want to, you know, join me, just grab a movie. Keith? I got a text message saying you wanted to see me. I think it was "needed", not "wanted". Ah, how did you get this number? I don't give it out to anyone. You're not the only one at this school who has certain... gifts. Gifts... That was my grandmother's term for female... just so you know. What did you need to see me about? You know, Hearst has a pretty strict policy when it comes to plagiarism. Yes. Did someone plagiarize? You did. One of your classmates turned you in. There's a program we run to check papers. It scans online for similar phrases. I know how it works, but I... Your paper lit up like a Christmas tree. What?! I didn't copy my paper. So I assumed, but... well, that's your paper there. There's no way. Someone is trying to screw with me. You think it's me? You think I'm trying to get you out of Landry's class because I don't like you? Wait, you don't like me? This will have to come to Landry's attention. It's a bummer, since I know that you and he are now close. - So, how about I give you a choice? - Choice? Either you can tell him or I can. Tell who what? Hi, Infidelity Hey, pal. Can you believe this? Some lady threw her husband out of the house. Right now she's having a garage sale of all of his stuff. "London calling"... Vinyl... Unscratched... 99 cents. Awesome, right? My would-be-mentor professor just gave me three days to prove I didn't plagiarize a major paper. The universe is currently aligned against me, so nothing's awesome. You know what? You should come bowling. Bowling? You mean, like, just the two of us? Yeah. And Wallace... You know, the whole gang. Thursday nights are $1 night at fun bowl. Will bowling take my mind off of the fact that everyone's out to get me? It worked for Nixon. It'll be fun. Dude, I don't get this sad-clown face. I thought he let you drop the class. I haven't decided if I'm gonna. What's to decide? Two weeks after add/drops, he lets you drop a class that's kicking your ass. That's a gift. Take it and smile. Okay, okay, 5-On-5 scrimmage. Let's go. Move. Fennel, you run first team today. Wait, coach... You want to keep your starting job, Mason? Start showing me something. Let's go! Apparently, if you look hard enough, everyone looks like they're hiding dark secrets. So, if you're looking for something specific, you got to try the direct approach. Hi, some of you might know who I am... Veronica Mars. Okay, so, I wrote that paper, and now someone in this class has accused me of plagiarizing it, which I absolutely did not. So, I was kind of wondering who it was. So, is this silence like it wasn't any of you or like no one wants to face me? Or like no one actually did it and our weaselly T.A. is trying to... I did it. Jeff Ratner. Ratner. Um, have we met before? We have, but you probably don't remember, so whatever. - So, you reported me. Why... - Why? Maybe 'cause I'm a common-man kind of guy, and I like it when some teacher's pet who's destroying the curve for everyone gets exposed as a cheat. Yeah, you cheated. I caught you. Deal with it. Wallace? Not here. And you would be? Evil Wallace. And I know Veronica Mars doesn't hang with the evil and morally bankrupt. Evil Wallace wouldn't have confessed and faced punishment. Nope, you're regular Wallace. Well, regular Wallace has been given a chance to drop mechanical engineering scot-free, which would mean giving it up as my major. I mean, man. This was the first thing I was ever into... Figuring out how stuff works. It's all I ever wanted to do. You'll work it out. I know it. That's also very regular Wallace. Oh, by the way, who's the guy you bought the test from? So, this whole after-school-special monologue here didn't make much of an impression on you. His name's Max. He's in Clark hall. Why? Hi, Max? I was hoping you could help me. Well, I'm hoping I can, too. Okay, so, you want a new paper on modern forensics but different enough so that he won't guess who... No. This paper or one like it is posted online. I need to find it. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you already have that paper. I told you, my paper got zapped by the plagiarism scanner. I need to find out why and from what. Okay, whatever. Uh... hmm... ah, here you go. That's my paper. See, that's why I never use these free sites... No security. Checkers will catch you every time. Posted last year? Somebody must have faked that. I wrote this paper by myself last week. This must be a real Kafkaesque experience for you. Does it say who posted it? Uh... rory.finch@hearstcollege.org That's not you, is it? That might explain everything. And pencils down. Bring them up. Thank you. Have a good day. I'm sorry. What about? I called time, and you kept writing. I can't accept your test. Yeah, I was just finishing my... Time was called. I'm sorry. So you keep saying, dude. Come on. Do you have any idea who I am? I don't, and I don't care. Rules are rules for everyone, no matter who they think... That is classic. It was a proctor. The professor wasn't even there. That is so awesome. But I do not condone it in any way and had nothing to do with your decision to do it. - Do what? - Cheating. I told him it was wrong and he was gonna burn in hell. You're gonna burn in hell, man. I'll see you there. You cheated? I took 10 extra seconds on a test. I thought you loved bad boys. I do, but if that's your idea of bad, you need to turn in your badge. Hey, do you want to go bowling tomorrow night? Sure, unless it's some "critical analysis of bowling" seminar. No, it's just Wallace and his roommate And some other guys. Could be fun. What? Just Mac's had this project all week, and Parker's all alone. I think we should invite her along. How very "Emma" of you. Did you just make a Jane Austen reference? It's official. The end of days are upon us. Hey, Parker, what's up? Nothing. I think I just ate something's beak. Hey, do you want to come bowling with us tomorrow night? Bowling? Why? You know, hatchet burying, et cetera. Plus, Nixon found it soothing. Look, if you don't want to go because you'd rather see me fed to bears, fine. So, would you call that an accurate depiction of life as a private eye? Pretty close. I personally have never been hired to locate a Maltese Falcon, per se, but there was the case of the maltese dog. Ooh. Solid-gold dog? Real dog. This guy got some lowlife to kidnap his ex-wife's show dog. Not exactly how I imagined the criminal underworld. If they were all like Peter Lorre, my job would be a little more interesting. Thanks, Keith, for coming. These days my husband and I are just logistics. I can't remember the last time I just hung out and talked. Sure, it's great talking to someone for whom "Bogart" isn't a verb. Well, good night. The upside of landing Weevil the maintenance job... I get to babysit his keys while he's away at his cousin's wedding. So if I want to check the Hearst e-mail files for Rory Finch, I can do it on my own time. Of course, he didn't bother to label them, so... Veronica? Dean O'Dell, I'm so glad you're here. I lost an earring, um, at the meeting, And I wanted to find it before they vacuumed. But it was... Well, it's a good thing you happened to show up. Well, go ahead. Search away. McCall is starting to go straight back... You follow boxing? I only follow sports that are done to music. Wouldn't this be more comfortable, say, at home? Kind of my little secret. The wife's against it all... The scotch, the cigars, the televised violence. So, I kind of sneak it in whenever she has a charity function, a work function, whatever other functions modern women seem to have all the time. That's a haymaker. So, if you run into her, you didn't see me. Some things she just doesn't need to know. Absolutely. Now, I expect these formulas to be memorized as soon as possible. Mr. Fennel, I was under the impression you dropped the class. I said I'd think about it. You sure this is a smart choice? Probably not, but you've seen my standardized test scores. I'm not a particularly smart guy, right? I'm taking a zero. There are four more tests. If I average C's or above on all of them, I'll pass. Even I can do that math. Okay, there you go. You're gonna ruin your eyes with all that book learning. I stayed in Winkler's class. I took the zero. I need to study. I suspected that might happen. So, you figure out what was up with that plagiarism thing? As a matter of fact, a paper just like mine was posted online by rory.finch@hearstcollege.org... A Hearst e-Mail, But there's never been a student by that name. The address was set up three days ago from an I.P. Address at... get this... the Neptune Grand. After you turned in your paper. So, you're off the hook. It's over. Ah, my innocent and naive Wallace. When I find out who did this and I make them sing like the proverbial fat lady, that's when it's over. Okay, you're Rocky. Mechanical engineering is Mr. T. "Eye of the tiger" is playing. I'll see you later on. Yeah. What? When? Boom. I'm set. Are you ready for a night of bowling, huh? Fun, fun, fun. Fun? I'm pretty sure I won't ever be having fun again. Ah, damn, that's tonight. I'm sorry, man, but it's impossible. No, dude, you have to go. I invited Veronica. I said there's a whole gang going, including you. So, if you're not there... It's gonna look like you asked her out. Yeah, that sounds awkward. But it's not my problem. This is. Hey, dad. Hey, honey. So, tomorrow's "Out of the Past". It's one of my all-time favorites. I've got a conference at the Neptune grand. I don't think I'm gonna be free, but I'd like to do something else. Okay, well, keep me posted. Bye. So, for bowling, "earnest, I'm really bowling" or "I'm too cool for bowling, and I'm only here ironically"? When did crappy old shirts with stupid stuff on them become cool? I don't know why I ask you these things. I don't either, frankly. Were you just making a date? Look at you, Mr. Noir secrets. No, I was just seeing if Harmony wanted to see... Harmony? Harmony with the husband who isn't cheating, Harmony? Yeah, so? So, you're going on a date with a married woman. It's not a date. We saw a movie, had a drink, and talked. Which is a date. That's all we did. We're mature adults who happen to be friends. And I like the dumb shirt. Hi, honey, I'm home. Hey, moosetastic, hmm? What's that? I'm so tired of explaining. Hey, you've lived here a while. Do you have any inside connections? Inside connections like what? Like someone on staff you're pals with who might sneak you info they maybe aren't supposed to? There you go. Your pal? Of course. Hi, Tina. This is Veronica. Veronica... Hi. What's going on, Logan? I got a little favor. Anything. I'm trying to find out if a person was registered here... - Someone named... - Rory Finch. This isn't illegal, is it? No, I'm just kidding. Hold on. Yeah, Rory Finch. She stayed with us for a night a week ago and a few other times over the last couple of months. Always one-night stays. Is there an address, credit-card number? Post-Office box and paid in cash. All I've got's a name. If I left my cell number, could you call me if they check back in? Sure. Any friend of Logan's... Girlfriend of Logan's. Come on, boyfriend, let's bowl. Hey, Veronica. Cool shirt. I went the post-ironic route. Hey, Piz. Where's... Oh, hey, uh... Logan... Her boyfriend. We met. So, where's Wallace and the rest of this gang? Right, yeah, the gang. Well, Wallace had a crisis so he can't make it, and, um... So, it's just... Veronica. Hi. Hey, Parker, how's it going? - You met Logan, right? - Yeah, hi, sure. - And you remember Piz. - Yeah, hi. So, um, where is everyone? Hey, shoes. We need shoes. Yeah, let's get shoes. Darling, what size are those dainty feet that I love so much? Six. So, bowling, huh? Is this something you do a lot... You and the gang? - So, shoe size? - A whole gang? Well, Parker... some people couldn't make it, but it's... I can't believe you invite me out For the first time since I was raped on some cheesy double-date setup with that Piz guy. It's not a setup, I swear. Size seven, but this is not fun. Yahoo! That's 2/3 of a turkey, bitches! Hoo! Oh, you're in a deep hole, Piznarski. We're gonna totally humiliate you. But you know, no pressure. Refreshments? 10 martinis. Anyone else? Dearest darling? Come on, Piznarski, we're dying! Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is fun. Veronica, I'm sorry I was so grumpy before. You're right. It feels good to just be out in the world. Oh, no! 7-10? That's the worst spare in bowling! Whatever shall you do? Come on, Piz. We need that spare. Don't blow it, Piz. So, what's the story with him? Him? Nothing. I've got a boyfriend. No. No, no, no, no. I mean, is he free? Free as in... ...as in he's cute, don't you think? That went straight to hell. - Find out what he thinks of me. - What? Oh, no more fun. Too exhausting. Next time we'll get in some weight training before we bowl. Just the soap opera. Parker wants me to find out if Piz likes her. What do I do? Pass a note? Scribble it on his trapper keeper? Hey, did you get an "A"? Yeah, but the cheating kind of cheapens the whole thing. You're only cheating yourself. Yeah, well, I got off easy. You know that... ...kid Horshack from that prison experiment? He got caught doing two tests. They busted him. And guess who else. That psycho guard that was tormenting him so bad, Rafe, yeah, he was taking his test for him. Can you believe that? People are crazy, huh? Thank god. Real food. Good evening, Mr. Echolls. That voice... I recognize that voice. Wait. Have a good evening. Excuse me. Jeff Ratner... What a surprise. You guys know each other? You want to tell him, Ratner? What's to tell? This is the guy who's trying to get me tossed out of Landry's class. You should be. You cheated. Now it turns out you work at the Neptune Grand, which happens to be where the fake paper was posted from. Strange, huh, Rory Finch? What are you talking about? I don't "happen to work here". I've worked here two years. You've seen me a hundred times, but you don't notice the little people 'cause you're too busy lounging with captain moneybags here. That's admiral moneybags. - I trust our steak's to your liking? - Always. Good night, then. That's my girl, spreading sunshine wherever she goes. That boy doesn't know it yet, but he's the living dead. Dude! Dude! Hey, look, man, it's school policy that if you're dead, I get to keep your stuff, so if you are dead, just don't say anything. Well, that's disappointing. Oh, crap. Hey, I could have just left you there and taken your iPod, so... you're welcome. Big shot! On the left! Coach. I'm sorry. I missed my alarm. Come here. If it ain't Sleeping Beauty. Play the game, Mason. You have a chance to start this year as a freshman. Don't blow it by staying up all night partying. You need to buckle down, Fennel. - Now, go suit up. - Okay. Take a big shot! Eight years ago, I was sent to ask Brad Stark if he liked Suzy Doyle. The two of them never spoke again. In the intervening years, I haven't gotten any better at this. We'll talk later, all right? Bye. Hey, Veronica. Hey, Piz, thanks for bowling the other night. That was fun. Good. Yeah, great. Did Logan have a good time? He did, as well. We both did. So, everyone had a good time. I declare bowling a success. And Parker had a good time, too. Oh, yeah, good. She seems nice. You think so? The reason I ask is because... I'm sorry. I'm having a traumatic-stress flashback to the sixth grade. Parker thought you were cool... ...and also cute. Oh. Well... oh. Oh, what? No, she's really nice, but she's not really my type. Oh, you have a type. Yeah, kind of. And it's not her. Okay, so, remember, this was just a practice quiz, but all this material will be on your next exam. Mr. Fennel... 67... "D" plus. That's a real improvement. Hey, Veronica, guess what I just found out. Piz has a radio show. - I know. - Tonight. You know, the station's right in student union. - Let's drop by. - It'll be late. Oh, late schmate. It'll be fun. Everybody's always saying that. Join us next time when we ask, "why does everyone hate America? Is the rest of the world crazy or just stupid?" Well, that's it for the Piz. Stick around for Club Flush. This is so cool! Why didn't you say you had a radio show? You know, I meant to mention it, but I guess it just slipped my mind. We were just in the neighborhood. I always wanted to know how it all works. Maybe you could show me what all this stuff is sometime. The guy who does the club and house show is supposed to start now, so... What's everyone doing after? I could totally use Pizza. You can have this. I only licked it a little. Hey, Veronica. Hey, Mercer. You're the club and house show? The down-and-dirty clubbin'-est. Hi, I'm Mercer. Hi. Well, I haven't eaten dinner, so I could grab a slice. Actually, we got to go. We'll see you later, Piz. Nice meeting you, Parker. Parker, are you okay? That guy Mercer. I just... His cologne. I smelled it before. Yeah? It's, like, burned into my brain... from the night I was raped. I mean, I can't be sure, but... I just got the worst... Vibe? Yeah. He'll be in there for the next two hours. I'll look into it. Because I've still got 24 hours with Weevil's keys. You want to know why? 'Cause I'll stick my foot so far up your... Hey. Could someone let me know when some girl is in my office? What are you doing here? I'm here about the rapes at Hearst. Already aware of them. Thanks for coming by. I'm real busy. This is sketchy, but... If it's Bigfoot, we checked. He's got an alibi. Oh, rape humor. It never gets old. I know one of the victims. Yesterday she thought she recognized the guy who raped her by his cologne. And then I just happened to be in his room, and I saw some clippers. Does this man have a name? Mercer Hayes. The kid who ran the card room that got robbed. That's him. What? We finally found the stolen cashbox, and... along with all the money, we found something interesting... Two vials of G.H.B... The same date-rape drug the rapist used on two of his victims. Hey, how's my Diaper Dandy? Here to get some extra work in? Actually, coach, I got this class that's killing me. I could drop it, change majors, but it's what I want to do for a living. I think I need to take the semester off. I'd be back by mid-season. I know you don't have to keep me on scholarship. Keep the scholarship, Wallace. But you do realize you're throwing away your chance to start. You probably won't smell the court this year. Are you prepared for that? I assumed after I called Ratner on this Rory Finch thing it was over, until my new friend Tina Callas told me he just made a new reservation. You rang? There you are, miss. What are you doing here? Just grabbing a drink. Are you... 2 martinis sir. What are you doing? Honey, I told you, it's completely innocent. We're just friends. "You think the other person's great and you have a great time doing stuff together" friends? And there's nothing wrong with that. Unless your friend is a very attractive, unhappily married woman. Veronica, I know a little more about this than you. Don't worry. I worry. Okay, number 906, behind which lies the answer to everything. - Veronica Mars? - Mrs. O'Dell? I was looking into a term-paper thing. I'm sorry. Wrong room. So, now I'm actually confused. What does the dean's wife have to do with the mysterious Rory Finch? Oh. Veronica. Professor, hi. I got off on the wrong floor. Ah. Well, nice seeing you. See you in class. Rory Finch? Perfect. Oh. Oh. You know what they say about martinis. Something involving breasts? One's too few, et cetera. I'll have to settle for one if I'm gonna make it home. We don't have to worry, I mean, if we don't want to. What do you mean? I mean... well, honestly, I need to tell you something. I wouldn't, but all alone at the house, I've got a lot of time on my hands to think. And one of the things that I think is knowing that I don't want to be lying on my deathbed someday just counting regrets. I'm still not sure what you mean. I mean, I got a room here if... If we think we might have use for... Oh, no. Harmony, I don't know if that's such a good idea right now. Oh, no, Keith, I'm sorry. I've ruined... No, you didn't ruin anything because I really, really, really want to say yes. You are an amazing woman, and I just can't. I don't want to be on my deathbed counting regrets either, but I just can't figure out which I'd regret more... Going up or not going up. So, I have to... I'm sorry. Oh, man. I totally didn't see that sign. Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I am okay. I'm okay. Man, I'll get... I'll get some help. Dad? This nutritious breakfast isn't gonna eat itself! Come on. Up and at 'em. Dad! Dad, come on. Miss Mars! Do you need something? Just to give you this. This proves that whoever posted the paper I supposedly copied online did so after I had already turned mine in. I didn't cheat, this proves it, and that's the end of that. Great. So, you're off the hook. Did you prove who did it? More process of elimination. But I'm still not sure why, so I thought I'd ask. Why did you do it? Why did you want me to follow that trail to Rory Finch? You could get in a lot of trouble, you know, - If I decided to... - Let me interrupt and preface this entire conversation with this. I didn't do it, and you can't prove that I did. Hypothetically, I can see where one might think someone in my position would want to set up this sort of treasure hunt. I mean, after all, I was professor Landry's protÃ©gÃ© for three years before you showed up... His star pupil, right-hand man. I got his dry cleaning, ordered Chinese when we worked late. I was like you. "What a professor! He's smart, charming, such a great guy". And then you find out he had an affair with the dean's wife. There were others before. The dean's wife... That's recent. A person in my position might have thought he was doing you a favor. Since the professor thinks so highly of you, It might be helpful to demonstrate who he really is before you go too far under his spell. Do me a favor, will you? Don't do me any more favors. What's this? You have the same kind of crazy press-clipping board every movie serial killer keeps. You know, there's been no DNA evidence so far... No semen, no hair. Makes you wonder. Huh. You see something I don't? Maybe. You really thought Ratner did it? Oh, crap. No, no. I did not put those in there. Hooke's law and a prismatic rod. Length "L" and cross-sectional area "A" we treat as a linear spring, so extension is linearly proportional to tensile stress by a constant factor... The inverse of its modulus of elasticity. Ah, miss Mars, join me, would you? Uh, sure, dean. I just don't want more kids coming and giving me their ideas about how to run the school... My biggest problem as dean. I don't like college students... Most of them, anyway. So, why do you eat here? This damn burger... I love it. If you see my wife, don't tell her. There's some things she's better off not knowing. Dean... just some... Hey, I need to talk to you. Sorry, I'll be right back. - So, what's up? - I need your help. - What's wrong? - It's Mercer. Lamb just arrested him for the rapes on campus. He didn't do it, okay? You have to help. How do you know he didn't do it? 'Cause I was with him the night of the rape this summer.
