my criminology professor. Are you gonna tell him? You know the rules, honey. I have to. Shrink asked if a lifetime without a libido was such a bad thing. I think she's given up on me. You just need more time. And I think we can take a tough but survivable amount of pain now... Or stay together and deal with unbearable pain later. So, I vote for the pain now. You should hire someone to do this. Hey, you're lucky I'm not a farmer. You'd be out ploughing a field. What is manila anyway? I don't know. Is it a substance, a colour maybe? "In the kitchen, we'll do a nice manila." I'd say more like, "by the time we dug him up, he turned manila." Don't you have to get to class? On my way. Oh, and Wikipedia says: "Not a what, but a where, called 'manila' after hemp from the Philippines." Oh. Good Morning. Guess that would explain why this filing was giving me a killer buzz. Oh. Can I help you, Mrs. O'Dell? I hope so, Mr. Mars. Please, come in. My husband didn't kill himself. What makes you think that? Because I know my husband. Mrs. O'Dell, I saw him that night. He had just learned of your infidelity. He was drinking heavily. Well, it was in him to sulk, to divorce me, even, but... he would never in a million years kill himself over me. The sheriff ruled it a suicide six weeks ago. Why come to me now? Honestly? Money. As his death was ruled a suicide, his life insurance is denying benefits. I'm a widow with two children to take care of. You told Mr. O'Dell you were at a junior league meeting the night he died. Are you asking for my alibi? If it is a murder, you'll be asked for it repeatedly. Your husband implied that... your junior league nights were a cover for your affair with... Professor Landry. I was with Hank... all night. Look, I didn't kill Cyrus, Keith. Niether did Hank Landry. But someone did. Well, let me dig around. If I find anything, I'll take the case. Thank you. Wow, this is one trashed lab. All that's missing is a big hole in the wall shaped like the Hulk Somebody called tech support? I did. We had a break-in. Our computer was sabotaged, and it's dead. There's a year's worth of research on that hard drive. Our professor will have med students practicing autopsies on us. Professor McGregor has to understand it's not our fault. I locked up, Pauline. Do you have a backup? Yeah. He's gone, too. Your backup's a he? Twenty-five, our research monkey. He is the research. Even if you save the hard drive, without Twenty-five, the whole project is dead. And we'll be dead, too, if McGregor finds out we lost him. Who do you go to, to find a stolen monkey and twenty control-group rats? Logan Echolls, don't you get it? Ex-boyfriend. That's your new title. It comes with certain restrictions. This is my Food Court time. You're not a breakfast person. You're not even an early-lunch kind of guy. Can't we just agree this is Veronica time? - Veronica! - Mac! And the people coming to take me away. Veronica Mars, Pauline Elliott and Gil Thomas Pardy. They're missing a monkey. And twenty rats. - We're talking "monkey" as in... - "Touch my..." It's not just any monkey. Please tell me he plays piano. Twenty-five is a genetically altered capuchin monkey. Its uptake-inhibitor proteins have been coded... to allow us to monitor cholesterol breakdown at a cellular level. And he can play "Chopsticks." Excellent. Any idea who would want to nab... Um, what's his name again? It's not a pet. We don't name them or wrap squeaky toys up for Christmas. His research ID number is twenty-five. Yes, I know exactly who stole him. It was those damn fat kids. Because, I take it, monkeys are delicious? And, dude... "girth-challenged" is the preferred nomenclature. P-H-A-T: People for Humane Animal Treatment. They've done this kind of crap before. They liberated him... and took a year's worth of research in the process. Please, this is our future. We need that monkey back. Veronica Mars 3X10 "Show me the monkey" Transcript: Inigo [vmtranscripts.com] Synchro: Camilla [veronicamars.it] Vieni a trovarci! veronicamars.it I just can't wait for that moment when you're in a tree, going... "here, monkey, monkey," and holding out a banana, and then the branch breaks and hilarity ensues. Ah, if there's hilarity, I charge extra. Think you can salvage anything off their hard drive? Iffy. Looks like someone poured something on it. Aha! You've solved the case. PHAT is having a recruitment meeting tonight. Square one. Want some company? What? This soft spot here... It's for all creatures, great and small. Okay, the more, the merrier. All we need is one more angel, and we've got a show. I'll come by your room. Dress cruelty-free. We want to blend. Got it. Off to class. - Hi! - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Looking for you. I need to find Weevil. You two palling around now? I need to ask him some questions. Mindy O'Dell doesn't think her husband killed himself, and Weevil found the body, so... You think Dean O'Dell was murdered? Uh-uh. Not really. I think he had his heart broken and shot himself. I suspect his wife feels a tremendous amount of guilt. So why take the case? I haven't yet. I'm checking it out. Physical plant after 6:00. How did you find me? My cell phone is not on. Maybe I'll tell you someday. According to the PHAT website... we should stay away from fur, obviously, down, leather... The one day I feel like wearing a leather miniskirt. If it ever had a face or parents, you can't wear it. So my mollusc shoes are cool? Oh, does this say "cruelty-free"? It says... "I've given up. Don't look at me." Hey! You guys haven't picked a country yet. For the around-the-world party. Every dorm room dresses itself up like a different country. Party, fun? No? I prefer most of the people on the floor, you know, not in my room. Okay. well, if you change your mind, let me know soon. Most of Western Europe goes down fast. Single. Single and on the rebound. Just so you know, we're approaching critical, pathetic mass... if the girl who most wants to host gentlemen callers... is the most recent victim of a sexual assault. We should be out there! Or, at the very least, not barring them from coming to us. Okay. I get cruelty-free, but I'm an animal, too, and the clove cigarettes and no-bathing thing is cruelty to me. Oh. No. Not you. You're... fine! You guys ever been to one of these things before? Me? No. I come from a meat-and-potatoes kind of family, minus the potatoes. My first pacifier was made of jerky. Well, it, uh, it could be fun. Or it could be a lot of speechmaking by politicos-in-training. Or that. My name is Bronson Pope. I'm the chapter president of PHAT here at Hearst. I'd like to thank everyone for coming out. From food industries to clothing to medical research, corporate America employs horrible cruelty to animals, simply to maximize profit. It's a tragic state of affairs that we fight with education. People who disagree aren't the enemy. They're the goal. Yeah? This is in addition to some of the more active stuff? There was a rumour that someone... liberated some research animals. I was just wondering if... we'd be doing anything like that. What? I raised my hand. That's really not our thing, but if you're eager for action... how about joining us tomorrow night to launch our letter-writing campaign? Sure. That sounds almost as good. You know, Bronson, that psycho bow-hunting rocker guy Ed Argent... is playing downtown tomorrow night. We should consider picketing the show. You ever meet an Argent fan, Darla? Uh, they'd pay double to spit on our picket line. So, I came in at around seven. First, I thought he just... had a bender and fell asleep at his desk, but then I saw blood... and the note. A note? Yeah, on the computer. He had a memo on the screen, saying... "Goodbye, cruel world zzzz." I guess his head fell on the Z. It's a shame, man. He was pretty cool... for a weird... old white dude. So, uh, what? You just wanted to see if he left any booze? I think I told you, the management asked if you'd stop doing that. That's exactly what's been wrong with you lately. Since when do you side with management? Ooh, best-case scenario: old lady. What's with you? That is awesome! How about a little life? So what, you're just going to mope around like that guy in... what's that book where the guy's mom dies... and he comes back to Jersey? He's got that motorcycle sidecar. Garden State was never a book. It wasn't? Oops. So much for that paper. But if this were a book... the theme of my essay would be... the symbolism of how your character... had his man parts ripped off by the Veronica Mars character. My man parts are intact. Show me. Well, you'll have to take my word for it. I mean, symbolically. We're young, single men in our sexual prime... and the only reason why we're not out there going hog-wild... is because of your feelings? What, are we on "The View"? Am I Rosie O'Donnell? Here's something I read. "Today is the first day of the rest of your life." Think about that. Really, think about it. Yeah, well, as a statement, it seems, you know, obvious and pointless. Which means... that's what your life is. You need help. I'm offering, okay? Nothing too major, just baby steps. Just, please, let me help you. Hey! Thanks for coming. Um, lick or stuff? Letters are there, envelopes there. You know, this is what it's all about. Yeah, if people knew that every research animal... on campus is caged, tested, and killed, you know, they might not be here in the first place. Every research animal? Yeah, that's why this is so important. Well, I'd like to stuff. Okay, come on. Darla, hi. I'm Veronica. I think your idea to protest Argent was great. If you go through with it, I'm in. I do a wicked picket. Look, I know letter writing isn't all you do. You got to be careful with new members. I get it. But, just so you know, I'm ready. Good to know. Your friend seems pretty gung ho. Veronica? She played pee wee soccer; she made her own penalty cards so she could red-card players she didn't like. I'm glad you guys came. I don't usually have much fun at these. The letter stuff seems fun. Do me a favour. Casually look over there. What? How's it going? Great! Maybe we should throw in some low-interest credit-card apps, really grab their attention. Yeah... letter writing's good, but... uh, some of us aren't so patient. Some of us want to get the message out a little more... actively. If you're interested, maybe you can prove yourself. What do you have in mind? Just something that gets our attention. Surprise us. You look sad. You and your friend Weevil have a fight or something? Just thinking, if I was going to get drunk and shoot myself, I'd probably drink the good stuff first. Sheesh. Good thing we don't have any good stuff. Dean O'Dell did, a bottle of forty-year-old single malt. Said he lived in anticipation of drinking it. So why, if he's going to commit suicide... does he drink the cheap stuff instead? You had a few run-ins with the dean, right? What were your impressions of the man? I... admired him. He had character... or was one, or something. I don't know, just... How 'bout his rhetorical style? Businesslike and bland? More... Old Testament sarcastic. Sarcastic? Like he might leave a dumb cliché as a note, as a joke? What did the note say? "Goodbye, cruel world," typed as a memo. Like on the computer screen? Yeah, why? Just... We had to do these papers for Landry's class, like plan the perfect murder. I got an A, just in case you were wondering. And what does this- Mine was a fake suicide, where you leave a note on the computer, so you can't check the handwriting, and write something clichéd so you don't study the message. My example was: "Goodbye, cruel world." Hey Piz! Ed Argent is in town. Think you can pull some of that... Oregon-mountain-man, kill-what-you-eat, gun-rack charm and book him on your show? Everything north of San Francisco... is just Thunderdome to you, isn't it? It's for a case... involving... a missing monkey. The case of the missing monkey? Mm-hmm. You'd be helping science and me, and you might help... classic rocker and conservative wild man Ed Argent... connect with a whole new audience. So everybody wins, which is nice. That is nice. So, how is Ed Argent connected to the missing monkey again? I didn't say, and I can't. Client privilege. You'd be doing me a favour I'd really appreciate. Look. Twenty-five's food is gone. It was here after the break-in, and now it's gone. Obviously, those PHAT fanatics are trying to take care of him. What did you find out? There might be a splinter cell. I'm setting something up to get inside. So, what happens to Twenty-five... after you complete your research? The only way to conclusively prove test results is through an autopsy. So... that monkey good life includes... a blindfold and a last smoke? You sound like one of them. It's just a question. Ah, a question like, how do we cure cancer... or discover new vaccines? You've got the A/C on full. If you want to see my nipples, just ask. How many times do I have to say, "temperature affects rates of carbon assimilation"? I don't know, Emmy, a billion? Friend of yours? I was in my lab until around nine, locked up. Didn't see anything suspicious and went home. I already talked to campus police. I'm sure you did all you could to help your pal Pauline. They have twice the space I have. For what? To find a pill so fat guys in the suburbs can keep eating cheeseburgers. It's ridiculous. Look, I may not love Pauline and Gil Thomas, but I'm a scientist. I'd never vandalise a lab. Ever. Hey, that was awesome, man. Thanks a lot. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! I am your biggest... super biggest fan. I joined the NRA... after they covered you in Guns Magazine. Oh, I loved that article. Totally. The second amendment is, like... my favourite. We were so hoping... to get a picture of you in our sweatshirt... for our celebrity wall. Anything for a fan. Awesome. Maybe, after the show, I could stop by the sorority. Ooh, I think the Theta Betas would really enjoy that. Okay, say "meat!" Meat! Meat is Murder Hey! Look at this. "Argent tells KRFF listeners: rock hard, eat what you kill" Tell your friend you guys are in. Three o'clock, that room. Great, you're here. Come in. I've never been initiated before. Think I'll get a code name? We really loved what you did, and we want you to join our anti-fur campaign. Congratulations. You're one of us. NO FUR We have a lot of work to do, so just go ahead and take 'em off. Uh, take what off? Your clothes... for the calendar. You are committed, right? It's an ongoing question in the private-eye game: "how naked are you willing to get for a case?" This campaign epitomises what we're about. Oh, yeah, totally, but- We know you guys believe in the cause... that fur is the unnecessary killing of animals... for nothing more than human vanity. So, you want to pose together? Oh yes! Sorry. We do this to all the real gung-ho recruits. But we totally love you guys. That Ed Argent thing was genius. So... Some of us are going to grab a bite, if you want to come along. I'm good. I had some mints. So... you have any plans this weekend? We have that around-the-world party tonight, remember? You should come. Every room is a country. Very educational. Yeah, great. Uh, what country are you guys? Bella! Bella! Ciao. I love your enthusiasm. Love it. Ooh, caliente! So, you're participating now? What about this is Canada? Uh, our accents. Eh? And I almost forgot aboot... [One Week - The Barenaked Ladies] It's been one week since you looked at me... cocked your head to the side and said I'm angry. There you go. Five days since you laughed at me... It's ok. saying get that together come back and see me. I'm confused. I thought you were against the whole party idea. We were. And then... "The guy" happened. - Ooh! - No. In a way. I don't know. Somebody was doe-eyed, tongue-tied, and, dare I say, twitterpated? Hey, there's enough guys for everyone. Maybe Piz will show up. Ugh. God, I'm so over that. I don't know what his problem is. I think he has a girlfriend back home. It's a new day. No more games, no more waiting around. I'm ready to be wooed! Amen, sister! That was supporting, not joining. I do not want to be wooed. Don't you want to hear all about how great you are? I mean, don't you want to see... the look on some cute guy's face... when he realizes that you're not only smokin'-hot... but funny and smart? Why, you're the catch of the century, Veronica Mars... And so are you. Are you saying we ought to... Mingle? I'm saying there's a saddle, Veronica, and we should be back in it. It's just hard when you know you've tried your best. You know? I do. It's a bitch. I really wanted that relationship to work. I was committed, which is hard for me. Think I should call her? Can you excuse me for just one sec? So, how's it going? I'm trying to keep an open mind. And you? I think I've been around the world, and I want my room back. This just isn't my scene. Can you manage Ultimate Boy Quest 2007 solo? He didn't show. Okay, everybody, Canada is closing! Sorry. Border-control issues. Sorry. So, what do you do, like, for fun? Um... I don't really know. You play any sports or anything? Nope. So you just, like, hang out? Not really. I... my hobby is... more like a job... Which is kind of like a compulsion. But it's fun sometimes. It doesn't really leave time for what most people consider... Mac? There's someone here to see you. Oh. Hey. Hey. I checked his ID at the border, and all seems on the up-and-up. So, how's it going? I'd say it's boys zero, me zero! Think I'm calling it. Well, we can't go back to Canada. "The guy" showed up an hour ago. Sorry I've got to go so soon, but... That's why I wasn't doing much activism. Cuts into my partying. You should have seen me before I quit Greenpeace... and the Sierra Club. Jeez, why are you so down on people raping the planet? I mean, really. Yeah. Well, thanks for showing me Canada. Sure. Sorry. - Um, I... - No, it's... Yeah, well, I guess I should go. Okay, baby steps. Just some dudes, some tasty waves, and some tasty brews. It's all we need. Where the hell you been?! What? You think I just roll out of bed looking like this? It takes time. Low maintenance. You should try it. What? Getting chewed by an angry mob of lesbians... who stick eggs up people's butts? No, thanks. I'm just saying, it does simplify one's personal grooming. Are we here to surf or swap hairdo secrets? Dude, wait. Check it out. I thought all I needed was some dudes, some tasty waves, and some tasty brews. Well, we didn't bring enough beer to make them hot anyway. This is dumb. I blew it. It's over. It's not dumb. Just keep it simple. "Hi, my insane friend stole your driver's license." It wasn't stealing. It was making an excuse to see him again. So you say, "Hi, you forgot your ID at the party. We're going out, thought we'd drop it off, and, hey, you want to come along?" You want me to say that? Mac, he tried to kiss you. And my libido didn't kicked in. Mac, he understands. He seems like a really great guy. Just a regular vegan JFK looking for his Mackie O. Hey, there! Hi! You left your ID. Here it is. Good seeing you. Well, hey, um, come in. I want to show you some results. Oh, and this is Amy, everyone. Letters from Bellissima Cosmetics. They quit animal testing, thanks to the letter campaign, because they make all their money off of college kids. You're pretty dressed up. Where you guys off to? Uhm... Club...Club. It's new. Mind if I get a glass of water? Yeah, kitchen's in the back. Let me- No, it's okay, I'll find it. That's really cool. See, you did it. Did what? You lived. I told you, chicks are just a distraction. You're better off without that broad. Yeah, well I'll admit, this has its charms. Hey! You got any more beers? Okay, new category: hot enough. Yeah, sure! How about "chicks are a distraction," huh? I didn't say a bad distraction. What have you got? Apparently, we're into the cheap stuff. Yeah. If you guys get bored of Club Club, you should come by Goldfinger's. I tend bar there. Do you hang out there a lot? Not really my scene. We have slightly different ideas on... Might want to grab a drink. His bedroom. Um, okay if I grab a quick H-2-O, as well? It's important to hydrate. Yeah. Rats. Why didn't you say anything? I saw them, the test rats you liberated. Where's the monkey? Um, I don't have the monkey, and I didn't free the rats. They just showed up. Like, in a tiny van... with a sob story about needing a place to crash? Like, in a box on my doorstep. Yeah, people know I'm the animals guy. It happens. Can I see the box? So... Amy seems nice. How long have you been together? Uh, nineteen years. She's my sister. Oh. So, uh... are you going to tell Pauline and Gil Thomas about the rats? They're clients. I kinda have to. Boy, oh, boy. You are bad. Man, I can't believe I just did that with Aaron Echolls' son. They were in a rat habitat in Bronson Pope's bedroom. He said someone dropped them off. Dropped off? Funny. What about Twenty-five? He says he didn't get the monkey, but you have the rat photos, so it- Can we get the sheriff's department to get a search warrant? Excuse me. Hello. Veronica, hey. I found something interesting in this hard drive. We got a report about some stolen rats. Got a warrant. Hey! So, you know, I figured some sort of liquid was poured over the computer with all the research on it. I had to remove the ram card to let it dry out, but- You told Bronson? The cops raided the place, and the rats were gone. I didn't want him to get into trouble. I believe him. I'm sorry. I found these on the motherboard. Looks like little leaves. Do you think it means anything? Oh, good. You. We found these in Pauline and Gil Thomas' hard drive, some sort of leaves. Any idea where they might have come from? Congratulations... You just narrowed down the suspects to anyone who had access to green tea. Green teeth? I stole it off Twenty-five's cage a few weeks ago. The sound was driving me nuts on the weekends. In the movies, when they piece back together shredded magazines, they always find an address sticker. All I've found are near-naked ladies. Did you name him? Is that what happened? Named who? Twenty-five. I heard him behind the door. Sounds like he misses you. There were tea leaves in the hard drive. You just grabbed the handiest thing around and poured it in the drive? Pauline's the one who drinks tea. But I'm guessing she doesn't subscribe to... lad magazines. When reassembled, the shredded pages from the rat box... were mostly almost-naked babes... making almost-naughty quotes. You knew you could pin the break-in on PHAT, and you knew Bronson would take care of your lab rats. I started coming in on the weekends to catch up on work. I bought him a few toys, let him play with them while Pauline wasn't around. His favourite, by the way. Always had to take it back before I left. One day... I'm halfway out the door, when I turn around... and he's holding it out through the bars for me. He knew I was leaving. You know why we don't name them? Because, to do the work, we have to turn our compassion off, because things are harder to kill when they've got a name. Veronica Mars... meet Oscar. Oh, Veronica, this is, uh, Professor McGregor. You said you had news. Here's your cheque back. I... wasn't able to find him, I'm afraid. Oh, those idiots at PHAT! They're paving the road to hell. Well, the good news is, Mac was able to recover most of your hard drive. Oh, for crying out loud, I thought you said you were getting him back. I said I thought we were. Well... the data could still be useful as a comparison. If we can rush-order another one, we might- Another one? Yeah. We should have another monkey in another... six days. Science marches on. Mac! ["Fair" - Annuals] Hi! Hi, Bronson! I was just... wasn't just in the neighbourhood. I was more actually coming by... because I was wondering... What I'm trying to say... or ask, is... I guess... Do you like movies? Uh. Yeah. Because they're doing 2001 in 70-millimeter tomorrow night and- Yeah. Let's go. Um, okay. Great. Bye, then. It's kind of lame, but a really hot girl band is playing at the Roxy. So they all went out to try and score, which is... both never going to happen and ridiculous, so I just took a shift to get out of it. I know how you feel. I mean, different team, sure, but... the whole chasing, hooking-up, people-go-round. Parker has been going nuts, like I'm some sort of freak because I'm not grabbing anything within ten feet. - It's exhausting. - Totally. I mean, it's like music. You know, I love music, but it doesn't mean I have to listen to it at all times and anything will do. I'm not going to throw in a Hasselhoff CD... just because I left my Nico Case in the car. Like, why bother with something that's not... good? - Because if it's not good... - It's bad. Exactly. But these guys were all like, "as long as she's got a pair of..." You know, it was indelicate. What's indelicate about shoes? I figure... you know, I mean, I know what I like. Why waste my time? Like, why bother with something not good... just because it's something? Especially when you know the difference, which not many people do. I mean, do you? I... I think I do. You see, I think that's like ninety percent of life, just knowing the difference. ["Long Long Time" - Linda Ronstadt] Everything I know to try and make you mine... - What'll you have? - Scotch, please. And I think I'm gonna love you... for a long, long time... It's a hell of a song. - Here you go. - Thanks. Wish someone felt that way about me. You married? Nope. Involved? Somewhat. To women! Women. What's she like? What are they all like? Crazy. Or we are. I haven't figured it out yet. Probably us. What's the craziest thing you ever did for a woman? I knew this girl once, best-looking woman the world had ever produced, as far as I could tell. She tells me her ex-boyfriend's bothering her... always showing up at the same parking lot she hangs out in with her friends. So one night, I went and I filled... a jelly jar with gasoline, stuck a rag in it, figuring, Molotov cocktail. I'll light the guy's car on fire. No more bother in the parking lot. She'll be impressed. You torched a guy's car? You ever light a rag soaked in straight gasoline? Thing exploded in my hands. I torched my car. Must have been a hell of a girl. What the hell was I thinking? Have you ever done anything like that? That why you put this song on, Keith? I read your book, all the way to your picture in the back. So, no... I've never done anything like that, like for instance... kill Cyrus O'Dell for a woman. I wrote a book, too, about profiling, reading people. Maybe you should check it out. I've thought it over, Mrs. O'Dell. I'll take the case. Good. Thank you. So, uh, what made up your mind? Just... the scotch. ["Greenland" - Kingsbury Manx] Hah. And good morning! Good mornig Piz. I was actually figuring... you got dinner last night, maybe I could spring for breakfast. - Oh, um, actually- - As ordered. Hey, Piz, what's new? Uh, nothing, apparently. I'll, um, I'll let you guys...
