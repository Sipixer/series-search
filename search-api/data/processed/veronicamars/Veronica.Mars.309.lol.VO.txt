What the hell? I was never gonna tell anyone about your... situation with the dean's wife. The whole motel was going up in flames. We had to get out of there. You didn't stick around to try to help? You didn't see if everyone was okay? I'm on my way to vote. Fate of the Greeks in my hands, and all. How are they faring? "Screw 'em." They're out of here. Someone raped me! The Hearst rapist has everyone on edge. [Right here right now - Fatboy Slim] Right here right now... You seen Veronica? Not in a while. Wallace! Piz, help! Veronica Mars 3x09 "Spit and Eggs" Vieni a trovarci! veronicamars.it TWO DAYS EARLIER Na - na, hey hey... Goodbye! Na na na na. Na na na na. Hey, hey... Goodbye! If the Lilith House's mission was to protect women on campus, I'm not sure this display is doing the trick. Sure, the Board of Trustees voted to dismantle the Greek system, but there's still a rapist at large. That hasn't changed. Sponduly! Ah. So the boy can still smile. Seems like a week since I've seen his teeth. Hey, handsome. Shh! Not in front of the old man. He's the jealous type. Hey. Hello Dick! I can't believe they got such a perfect likeness. Did you actually model for them? Yeah, you know, that reminds me, they left out one important detail. Excusez-moi. Take a picture, ladies. It'll last longer. Great job, Dick. I'm sure you won that debate. Well, he's a master debater. You two kiss, hold hands, head to the soda shop for some malts. I'm out of here. Okay. Don't try and stop me. You weren't outside my criminology class. I waited. Yeah. Something wrong? I can't do this anymore, Veronica. You know, I've been thinking, and... This isn't working. I don't think I quite measure up... to the person that you want me to be, and I just can't take feeling like a disappointment anymore. - Logan, I don't- - Hey, let me get this out, okay? The other thing... you told me you weren't built to let people help you. - That's not exactly what I said. - It's close. And you know what? I'm not built to stand on the sidelines. I don't know, I think we have a choice. And I think we can take a tough... but survivable amount of pain now... or stay together... and deal with unbearable pain later. So, I vote for the pain now. But I'm always here... If you need anything. But you never need anything. Yeah, but heavyweights weren't always a freak show, man. Ali, Frazier, those were fighters, you know? Just seems nowadays... All the talent's in the lower weight classes. You're so right. The average fight fan? He doesn't care. You should be good. You gonna test it? Hot damn, I'm back in business. What would I do if you ever left me? Call human resources and have them send a replacement? It's just a guess. Listen, you don't have high-def yet. I'll swing by when the receiver gets in. Page me if it goes out again. Thanks Eli. Oh, hard at work, I see. This job is easy. To what do I owe the pleasure? I brought you the minivan. You're gonna have to haul around Gram's drums tonight. Just got called up to Sacramento to meet with Helm's people. Can't they send Wally? Wally's going, too. I need the Volvo keys. Gonna be bored. I may be forced to speak to our children. Oh, remind them of how things used to be. They love that. I'll be home tomorrow by noon. Okay? You can order pizza, can't you? I'm sure someone will show me. Dean O'Dell, I'm sorry for interrupting. What is it? I have a man waiting for you who doesn't have an appointment. He won't give me his name or put out his cigar. Is that so? Cyrus. We need to talk. So, Mel... what can I help you with? You know what I liked best about my days here at Hearst, Cyrus? A quality education? No. It was hanging out on the front porch of my frat, watching the girls go by, drinking beer. I had such a good time here at Hearst, in fact, that I've been very generous over the years. Wouldn't you say I've been generous? Here you go. Veronica. I'm fine. - I know. We know. - Nobody said you weren't. - But it's okay if you're not. - You're Veronica Mars. I'm fine, seriously. I just told the two of you 'cause I... I figured you should know. I'm not looking for a pity party. That's good. I always get stuck blowing up the pity balloons. Is there anything that we can do for you? Nope. I... we're done with this topic. I just shared some info. Moving on. Hey, gang. What's the word? Is it "avuncular"? No? Just a shot in the dark. Hey, set your dials to K-Ruff tonight. I mean, we're already moving on as to what to do... with the whole Greek Row ghost town next semester. I got this one guy coming on the show, want to turn it into an ROTC training battlefield. Quality radio, people. What? You say your wife doesn't kiss you like she used to? I know how it sounds, Keith. How long you been married? Six years. Simply sounds normal, Cyrus. I'm sure everything's fine. Still, I'd like to be able to shake this feeling. She's on the 4:30 to Sacramento. She is, as she usually is, travelling with her associate, Wally Wornkey. He's handsome, he's a bit more age-appropriate for my wife, and I've seen him wipe Ranch dressing from her chin at a faculty function. Will you take the case, Keith? Hey, there you are. Going somewhere? Oh, very good, number-one daughter. You might make a detective yet. I'm off to Sacramento. Husband thinks his wife is fooling around in capital city. Here's my hotel information. You all right, honey? Logan and I broke up. I'm sorry to hear that. Are you okay? I can put off this assignment. No, you go. I'm fine. Just kind of unexpected. You sure? Go. Honey? Go! We're back and we're talking about Greek Row. Jennifer? Dean O'Dell refused to even read our proposal... to turn one of the deserted Greek houses... into a residence for devoutly Christian students. Had I been lobbying on behalf... of the African American students or gay students, would I have been dismissed out of hand like that? No Way. As always, we have an empty chair here for Dean O'Dell, should he ever accept We Were Just Talking's standing invitation... to join us on-air and defend himself. Lieutenant McGee, you have a radical plan... for what should become of the Greek houses. Which one of these is mine? T- take that one. And like magic, we have our illustrious dean here with us. Dean O'Dell, What do you got for us? I felt it was imperative... to get this news out as quickly as possible to the student body. It was recently discovered that one of our Board of Trustees members... who voted to abolish the Greek system at Hearst... owns property currently leased by several of the Greek houses. Due to this conflict of interest, his vote has been nullified. Hearst Charter dictates... that the dean of the university... is allowed to cast the, uh, dissenting vote... in just such an occurrence, and I voted to retain the Greek system. Thank you for your time. That is all. Uh, all righty, then. The Greeks are back. Let's go to the phones. Yeah! What's up, girls? [Have you never been mellow - Olivia Newton-John] Have you never been mellow? Have you never tried... Have you never been happy... ...just to hear your song? Have you never let someone else be strong? Rapist! Traitor! Rapist! Rapist! Running around as you do... ...with your head up in the clouds... Get me a roster of all the women of Lilith House. You have a guest. I told him that without an appointment- Keith, come right in. Have a seat. Thanks. So... what you got? Only good news. You have nothing to worry about except, perhaps, your apparent lack of gaydar. I don't know what that is. Wally Wornkey's gay. Your wife spent the night in her room alone, and Wally, on the other hand, visited, in succession, the Boathouse, Oilcan Harry's, and Taboo. Let's both just forget that I ever doubted my wife. Consider it forgotten. You need to see this. I circled it. What is it? It's a classified ad warning the student body to... stay away from the Pi Sig party. "I'll choose my next victim at the Pi Sig party tomorrow night. You've been warned." Veronica! Hey, come here. "I'll choose my next victim at the Pi Sig party"? The rapist is getting cocky. Yeah. Or Nish just wants to scare girls away from the frat blow-out. If that was the plan, I don't think it's working. We probably had a hundred girls stop by and pick up these. Coasters? Special coasters. You pour a drop of your drink on them, and they'll turn red if there's any GHB or Rohypnol in it. You mind if I take a bunch of these? Planning on tying one on? You can test ten drinks on one card. I suddenly find myself with free time and... in need of a project. You do get one of these, as well, a rape whistle. You actually think people would come a-running, huh? You have more faith in mankind than I do, my friend. What's it do? It turns red if there's a date-rape drug in the drink. You should require the Pi Sigs make them available at the party. I think I will. Cora, track down Chip Diller for me. I poked around at the newspaper office. No explanation on how the ad made it into the paper. They think it was changed at the printer's. You're a credit to the college, my dear. Well... aren't you warm and cuddly... for being the most reviled man on campus? My life doesn't begin and end at the university. My wife's getting back from Sacramento today, and I've got something special planned. Sacramento? What an enlightening weekend I had. You learn a lot about people... when you read their "Plan a Perfect Murder" papers. I must say, I'm a little frightened to appear before you today, and it's not just that a good half-dozen of you offed me. A chain saw, Biggles? Really? Let's see. We got rid of a full score of ex-girlfriends and ex-boyfriends, the local sheriff bit the dust, and several of you decided to turn yourselves into only children. As to how perfect your perfect murders were, eh, the results fell pretty naturally into a bell curve. Didn't even have to adjust. I will be posting the three A papers on the class website... so you can see examples of what I am looking for. For those of you who got A's, congratulations. You can get away with murder. Tim? Okay, but you should know, if you're gonna make me wait, I'm gonna pore over your creepy rape-investigation board. What's this? Dick, Chip Diller, and what's his face? Can I help you find something? What's with the circled Pi Sigs? Are you onto something? Did I miss something? Are we working together now? Are we Starsky and Butch? Cagney and Pastey. I think I'll keep my findings to myself. When I solve it, I want Dr. Landry to know where credit's due. And here I thought we were trying to protect girls. Huh. Then you... want to share your working theories with me? Excellent. Now, about your paper, I- I wanted to give you the opportunity... to fix some of these syntax and book marking errors... before I post it online. Ah, Veronica, have you met my girlfriend? Hi. Have we met? I don't think so. So Tim Foyle's girlfriend likes Dick and sundry other Pi Sigs. So what, if anything, does that mean? Soup? You know how I feel about soup. It's a side dish. There's a meat loaf in the oven. Now we're talking. Dad, you know that case you took up in Sacramento? Yeah. False alarm. I got to deliver good news for once. Dean O'Dell's wife is cheating on him... with Dr. Landry, my criminology professor. - And how'd you- - I dropped by his office. He told me his wife just got in from Sacramento. Two and two. And how'd you- I saw the two of them together at the Neptune Grand. He checks in under the pseudonym Rory Finch. You should double-check, but... I'm certain it's true. Are you gonna tell him? You know the rules, honey. I have to. I don't exactly know how to put this. It's the sort of thing that makes me hate being a resident advisor, but I have to ask. Someone has been leaving a surprise... in the third stall every day for the past two weeks. This person apparently never learned how to flush, and it's my amateur medical opinion that... he's also suffering from what must be a terminal disease. So? Not guilty, man. Third stall stage right or stage left? Stage right. Yeah, not guilty, either. Howdy, boys. Anyone up for going to a Pi Sig blow-out? Beer and ladies and music... and other stuff guys like, I'm sure. Fast cars, loose slots, electronic gadgetry, televised sports, pornography. Nothing? None of this grabs you? We were already planning on going. I think everybody at Hearst is gonna be there. Awesome. Then you can help me out. Suddenly it sounds like a lot less fun. What about you? Moe, are you going? Sort of. I'm driving the Take-Back-the-Night cart for the early shift. Give me your phone. Here's my number. Call me if you pick up any girls who are beyond drunk... or shady guys lurking around. Sure. Excellent. Meet you boys out front, nine sharp. I really appreciate it. What are we doing? Are you freaking kidding me? The Pi Sig mega apocalypse? Hump the furniture, party back to the Stone Age, fifty-keg bacchanalia? Sounds fun, right? Will they let me in? I think all the glitter has come off my porn star tube top. Please, Mac. I could really use the help. Resistance is futile. Thanks for coming in on a Saturday, Cora. Here's to a better week next week. Night, Cyrus. I've highlighted the cell phone calls they've made to each other, as well as the numerous charges made to Professor Landry... at the Neptune Grand. He always checked in under the pseudonym Rory Finch... and paid cash for the room but... charged drinks at the bar and... dinner at the restaurant. Those dates mean anything to you? If I recall correctly, these coincide with the nights of Mindy's junior league meetings. So, here's the plan. Do your own thing at the party, but... if you see a girl who looks out of it, sneak up to her drink, dip the coaster in, see if it turns red. If it does, the drink is dosed. If you see a really cute girl and you want to dance with her? Dance. Just know that your libido... caused some girl to get raped. That kinda takes the fun out of it. Hey, it's your life. Since when? See? You give me a hard time, I'm less enthusiastic about giving you the little... "thanks for helping" presents I made for everybody this afternoon. Congratulations. You're all twenty-one. I can buy myself a beer cup. Looky here. My favourite drink tosser. I'm so happy you came to Hearst. Seriously, does anyone like you? IDs out. Show them to our friend from the Hearst police department. Beer cups are ten bucks. Soda cups are five. Everyone must purchase one or the other. Right wrist. Print your name legibly on this cup. Use only this cup. Do not share that cup with a minor. I'll take a soda cup. Like I'm gonna drink in there. These are your rape-testing coasters? This is what you're handing out? Yeah. Don't get raped. Where's Chip Diller? Chip? I want you to take a look at these coasters... and see if you can spot the difference. Item one: printed on two sides... with the name of the drug-testing manufacturer on it, distributed at the Take-Back-the-Night booth. Item two: printed on one side, handed out at the Pi Sig party. One tests for date-rape drugs. My guess? The other tests to see whether drinks are wet. You don't know that. Find me a laced drink, and let's see if it works. Go on, go on. Find one. I'll time you. There you go, Bambi. If it turns red, he's trying to rape you. If it doesn't, he still might be trying to rape you. How do you live with yourself? Oh, it's a struggle, but I manage. [Sweet Caroline - Neil Diamond] Hands, touching hands, reaching out... Touching me, touching you... Oh, sweet Caroline... You know, when you think about it, it's not so different from going to a party normally, except instead of trying to avoid... the girl that's gonna puke in your car- Look. Drunk girl, ten o'clock. And I've been inclined... To believe they never would... Oh, no, but look at the night... It don't seem so lonely... We fill it up with only two... You're so cute. Hi, Bonnie. So, where's your boyfriend tonight? Do you see a ring? Hey, Veronica. Where's your boyfriend tonight? Oh, wait, I'm so sorry. You don't have one anymore. Bummer. Man, when I look at the two of you, all I see are a couple of Petri dishes. My advice? Use protection, lots and lots of protection. [Thank The Lord For The Night Time - Neil Diamond] Daytime turns me off, And I don't mean maybe. Nine to five ain't takin' me where I'm bound... Hey, there. Hey, there. You have an std. Classic. You are one major minor, you know that? Want me to... slip a little whiskey in that cola of yours? Sure. Thanks. What makes a man do it, Keith, sleep with another man's wife? Is there no honour left? Less than there should be, I'm afraid. Can I help you with something, Cyrus? A refill. It seemed a much shorter distance earlier. What's the rest of your evening entail? Passing out on this couch. All right, then. They warned me, Keith. "She's much too young for you." Keith, no! Do you know what you're holding? A bottle of scotch. That's a forty-year-old bottle of Glen Cracken. One of the chief joys of my existence... is the anticipation of tasting the contents of that bottle. But for tonight, I'm just getting drunk. Pour me the swill. [Thank The Lord For The Night Time - Neil Diamond] It seems like just one time I'm feelin' cool... Thank the lord for the night time... Yeah? Ah, is that your friend? So? You think she's okay? We called the Safe- Ride-Home people already. Look, there they are. Happy? Hey, guys. Mind helping us out with this one? Yeah, no sweat. We got it. Here. Nice way to take care of your friend. Don't mind her. She's always like that. Sure I can't give you a ride home? What's the point? My wife has a junior league meeting tonight. Ha! I'll just sleep here. Tim Foyle? Here? This can't be good. That's it, Bonnie. I've had enough! I've known about all of them. I've known about every knuckle-dragging frat boy... you've given a free ride, but guess what. I wasn't sitting back and taking it. Not at all! For every guy you were with, I was with someone new myself. Did you think I didn't know? I know everything! Looks like I'm single. Hey, Veronica. Hey. Hey. Okay. You two have fun. You don't have to go, Mercer. I'm just saying hi. Be that as it may, they're turning my show on after the band. Hope you brought your dancin' shoes. Let me guess. You're here because of the investigation. I am what I am. - Hey! - We got a positive. Positive what? This cup was dosed with a date-rape drug. It belongs to some Kim Kaiser. So where's Kim Kaiser? We asked for her. N- no one's seen her, but we found someone who knows where she lives. She's off campus by the marina, uh, the Harbour View Apartments. All four girls were raped in their own rooms. We've got to get there. I parked on campus and walked. Who's got the closest car? I do, but you're staying here. I'll go. - If you think- - Veronica, please. Let me do this part. Okay, go. Be careful. I'll go with you. Get her out of her apartment. That's all for us tonight, people. Club Flush is up next. Hi, uh, we're looking for Kim Kaiser. We think she's been given a date-rape drug. If you've seen her or you're friends with her, please come find me. I'll be right in front of the stage. Don't go. I've got crème brûlée arriving any second. You know, maybe someday... we'll have sex and you won't be stoned. I swear I'm having an affair with Annie Hall. Mind if I come in? Are you the girl looking for Kim? Because Kim didn't come to the party. I saw her drink cup. She lent her ID to her little sister, Carrie. Where's Carrie? She wasn't feeling good. She was walking back to her room. Which dorm? Benes Hall. You think she's all right? Line one. You're first caller. What do you want to hear? Yeah, man, you got any Chicks on Speed? Always, my friend, always. We just got a call, said a bomb was gonna go off... at one of the residential halls up at Hearst. Should we evacuate it? It's nothing. Happens all the time around finals. Let the Hearst police handle it. It's their jurisdiction. Maybe I should ask the sheriff. You want to call and wake him up? Unicorns, really? Well, we'll definitely be needing some mood music. [Right here right now - Fatboy Slim] You know, techno has a bad reputation, but I think it's undeserved. Groan if you disagree. Good. We're on the same page. It's unfortunate that when you wake up, all you'll know is that your hair is gone... because it's gonna be good. I'd wager your best ever. And it's a me thing, I'm sorry to say. I have no patience. I mean, if I'd met you in a bar or at a party, I would have had you back here... and on your back in an hour. But that's an hour of my life... I would have never had back, an hour of listening to you talk... about unicorns and... your high-school boyfriend... and how you hate the taste of beer. I'm just taking what you would have happily given. I mean, that's hardly a crime. I- What the he- Help! What are you doing here, Veronica? No one invited you. What am I gonna do with you? That's my face, you bitch! Oh, come back here, Veronica. Let's fix that hair of yours. Wallace, Piz! help! Veronica, are you okay? It's Mercer. Mercer's the rapist. Room 212 Benes hall. Get here as fast as you can. There's been an attempted rape, and the rapist may still be in the room. Hurry, please. They're on their way. The girl, Carrie Kaiser, she's still in the room. We can't wait. I'll get a bunch of guys and go down there. Stay in here. You'll be safe. Dad, pick up. Hi, this is Keith Mars. Please leave your message after the tone. You said she was here, Moe. She was. You let her get away, Moe? I'm sorry, sir. I don't care that you're sorry. Dad, help. Get the phone. Shut up! Stop blubbering, prisoner. What are we gonna do with her? I'm thinking. We're gonna get caught. Shut up. We're not gonna get caught. Give me all the GHB you've got left. We'll get it down her throat. She won't remember last year, let alone last night. I'm out of it. No. Then watch her. I'll go to my room. I got plenty. Hey, there. Uh, Parker, is it? Going somewhere? Uh, yeah, as a matter of fact. Where is she? Uh, excuse me. Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! I just touched you. Buddy, what's up? Mercer, what's going on? Who blew that whistle? Mercer, what do we do? What happened to your leg, man? Pet cougar, all right? Look, show's over, people, okay? Moe, shut up and get in your room. Good night, everyone. Sweet dreams. What are you looking at? You got someone in your room, Moe? Mercer? All right, you all have fun, okay? I'm out of here. She's just a psycho, and you're all falling for it. Mercer, where are you going? Mercer! Are you okay? Yeah. Oh, my God, Veronica. Oh, my God. What are you doing here? When a bomb threat's phoned in, you evacuate the building. That's procedure, Sacks. Sorry, Keith. I'm taking my daughter home now. Sheriff Lamb's on his way in. He wanted to talk to her. I called you from Moe's phone. You've got his number saved on your phone now. He's not smart enough to turn it off. Your ride back to Neptune is here, boys. I suggest you don't give me any more reason to shoot you. Moe was the setup man. He'd dose the victims, then call Mercer with the room number... and give him the master keys he needed to get in. Moe was the one who shaved me in the parking lot. I don't think he ever planned on raping me. He was just providing an alibi for Mercer. Well, what did the Pi Sigs have to do with it? Nothing, just nights Moe and Mercer could be sure... there'd be plenty of drunk girls, plus a convenient scapegoat. Has Logan been by?
