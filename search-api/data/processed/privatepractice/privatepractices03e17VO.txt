your daddy won't let you do anything stupid Because you're too cute to be in a cast. yes, you are. Oh, my god. Isn't he the cutest thing? What's your name? (normal voice) lucas. He looks just like you. Oh, and you must be dad. He has your eyes, but definitely mommy's smile. Bye. Bye. bye. "mommy's smile." Well, people see what they want to see. Uh, look, I gotta get to the hospital. Oh, okay. bye-bye. Bye-bye. Good morning. Good morning. I had this dream last night about peaches. I was thinking it meant something. You know, southern peaches being... I got it. I had a dream last night about peaches. Yeah, big, succulent southern peaches That went rotten and were all filled with maggots. Have any idea what that means? (woman speaking indistinctly over p.A.)</i> Kayla, you're supposed to be resting. Drew's report on afghanistan. I told him I'd proof it. (chuckles) junior high was a lot easier when I went. Maybe it's just that I didn't care so much. I was too interested in boys. (laughs) well, really just eddie. Is eddie here? No, he went home to check on the kids. But simon and angie-- they're getting a coffee. Angie is freaking out about the triplets. But I keep checking the monitor. Heartbeats steady. It's just me that feels cruddy, right? (knock on door) How are they doing? Ah, they are okay, but if you, uh, could just give me A couple of minutes alone with kayla? What is it? Relax, honey. Let's give 'em their space. It's just, you know, I'm so worried about our babies. It's okay. They can stay. Okay, uh... Kayla, I had a look at your repeat scans this morning. And, uh, the blood clot's not resolving. It's gotten worse. So what do we do? Angie, listen. I'm sorry. The problem is that the multiple pregnancies Are putting too much pressure on your veins. So even with the heparin, you're continuing to form new clots. So what happens? What do you do? The pregnancy, or the--the three fetuses, Are just too much for your body to handle. So I need to alleviate the pressure As soon as possible. The safest way to do that Would be to reduce the pregnancy to one. so you're-- you're saying You want to kill two of my babies? If she wasn't a surrogate, if these were her babies, Would you be giving the same advice? Yes. They're 20 weeks. A few more, and they'll be viable. Kayla doesn't have a few more weeks. If we wait, she could die. Transcript by Addic7ed.com Watching youtube again? Actually, fife was just bringing us up to date On his a.L.S. Antibiotic trial. these preliminary results are astounding. I say we get the human trials up and running, full steam ahead. Outstanding. I'll start to put together a larger subject group. (naomi) wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. The safety trials and the dosing studies are good, But we still need to get approval Before starting phase iii trials. That could take months. There are patients out there who need this now. This is too important to wait. I seem to recall being asked to be a moral compass here, A check on the slippery slope of science. We're going downslope too fast. Tell you what, I'll take you to dinner, Lay out my protocol, the steps I'd take. I'll win you over. Actually, I have dinner plans. I would gladly sacrifice r date in the name of science. Now you can't say no. It's settled. Damn it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Okay, I'm just gonna clean this off So I can get a good look at it. It shouldn't hurt. Thank you so much for squeezing us in. Our pediatrician back home never let anyone just squeeze in. Well, you're in luck. You're not gonna need stitches. Just a few of these bandages and some antibiotic ointment Will take good care of that. You won't even have a scar. Oh. You okay? I am. But eli doesn't believe you. Eli? Eli is, uh, maggie's friend. She's got a great imagi. Okay. Well, not to worry, eli. Uh, maggie will be just fine. I promise. He believes you. He's just sad. He thinks it was his fault. Oh, why is that? Eli kept saying that we should make some new friends here... Mm-hmm. That he's tired of just eating lunch with me. He kept bugging me, So I went over to these two girls in my gym class, And I introduced him. But they were very rude. You introduced eli? It's always the smart kids who get picked on, you know? Hey, you got a minute? Uh, sure. Uh, I wouldn't bother you, but with violet being gone-- You need a psych consult. Yeah, I get it. Um, 11-year-old girl Came in with an abrasion on her forehead, And then she had me talk to her imaginary friend. Seems a little old for that. Maybe. Maybe not. You know, studies have shown that children With imaginary friends excel academically. At 11? The girl just moved here. She's scared, shy. I'm worried that she's using the imaginary friend To ostracize herself. Maybe she could use some help figuring out how to fit in. Sure. Sure. I have a cancellation at, uh, 2:00. (clicks keyboard keys) Okay. You know, this thing with charlotte, I, uh... I don't want it to be uncomfortable between us. I mean, if there's a problem, we should talk about it. Sheldon, I know charlotte, and she's, um... Forget it. No, no, no. No, no. What? What? No, I-- no, no, no. What? No, no. Come on. What? Guy-to-guy, man-to-man? She's using you, man. She's using you to get to me. And I hate watching he yank your chain. We're having no problems in the chain yanking department. (laughs) Did it ever occur to you that maybe she likes me? No. I hate my life. Join the club. I'm about to terminate two of three triplets At 20 weeks. Oh, addie. I'm sorry. Is there nothing you can do? Nothing I can do. So... Tell me why you hate your life. Well, my current lover wants me to go to dinner</i> With the man who wants to be future lover.</i> I am a whore. William's making you go to dinner with fife? Well... It's not exactly walking the streets, nai. The--the two of them Are ganging up on me on this drug protocol. Only with fife, it doesn't feel like a drug protocol dinner. It feels, uh... Dirty. You know, good dirty. (laughs) but I--</i> William is amazing. Why can't I just be happy with what I have? A woman this morning mistook me for lucas' mother. Oh. Nai, I don't want to be a mother. Yes, you do. No, I don't want to be a mother, And I'm certainly not gonna fall in love with pete's kid. Yes, you are. He's in love with violet. Yeah, well, violet--for many reasons--is not available, And you are, and you like him. I do... A lot. So then is there any reason why you and pete can't be together And be happy and maybe be a little family? What? Oh. Is that the new girlfriend? Yep. That's her. He likes her. Yep. he likes her. I'm happy he's happy. here they come. Hey, sam. Addison. Vanessa, this is dr. Naomi bennett, my ex-wife. Hi. Pleasure. Hi. Nice to meet you. checking up on sam? actually, I'm here to see you. About kayla lindy. I was asked for a second opinion. Kayla called you? No. Uh, angie and simon did. They think you're wrong. Kayla, I know what we're asking. But we're asking. She says it's safe. And she says it isn't. they've waited so long for these babies. And we could use the money, with the kids' college-- Baby, I don't care about the money. Kayla, I know what you want, what you all want, But you cannot risk your life for this. But these babies, They're alive, and we're so close. They're not our babies. Look, all due respect, I can't lose my wife. We agreed to do this, But we have a family of our own to think about here. All right. Let me reassure you, we would get the best surgeon, And I think this is an outcome that will be good for everyone. (addison) I understand what you're all weighing, But my concern is for kayla, and my unequivocal opinion Is that this is not the right course.</i> I just finished my meeting with maggie, And I think you're right to be concerned. She's ostracizing herself? The problem's bigger than that, And it's not a social problem. I'm afraid she's schizophrenic. She's 11 with an imaginary friend. That's ridiculous. It's not that she has a friend. It's that she thinks he's real. I mean, an 11 year old knows the difference Between what's real and what isn't real. And this girl, I mean, eli is more real to her than you or me. And she's isolating. I'm seeing signs of paranoia. She told me that eli didn't trust you. Don't you think if she was schizophrenic, Her parents would've seen more signs? Well, it's hard for anyone to see it. And she may be just at the beginning, Which is why we need to address this fast. I'm gonna prescribe antipsychotics. Whoa. Her brain is still developing. We have a window here. She's going to hit puberty. The odds are that this is gonna be exponentially worse. But when we start these antipsychotics early, About 20% of these kids are able to function And have a fairly normal life. Without it, she doesn't have a chance. She had a normal life. She moved to a new town. Now you're gonna put her on a medication That's gonna alter her brain forever. It's too fast. Maggie doesn't have a choice. Eli is talking to her. You came to me for help. So let me help her. Dr. Montgomery... I know what you must think of me. But I can't have children. I wanted to. I went through years of vitamins and supplements, I.V.F., miscarriage after miscarriage. People who can't have children... There are other options. This is my other option. Those babies she's carrying... I've already named them. I've already bonded with them, all of them. And I know that you look at me with judgmental eyes When I push kayla to keep going. But she's my last chance. I understand how you feel. I do. But I can't support this because it's what I want Or it's what you want. I have to do what is right for kayla. Schizophrenia? No. Maggie's a good kid. She makes good grades. She loves to read. I mean, tell 'em about the types of things that she paints. Uh, the colors, the swirls-- it's beautiful. This is not a condemnation of youdaughter. She has a physiological disorder. She invented a friend to talk to. She has trouble getting along with other kids sometimes. That doesn't make her crazy. It makes her different. It makes her smart. It's a coping mechanism. Isn't that what you guys call it? Yes, if she were doing this, but she's not. Eli is not her creation. What do you think? I think your daughter is struggling with something, And that's why I went to dr. Wallace. And he's the expert. I know this isn't what you want to hear. But this is not about a social adjustment after a move. Your daughter needs to be treated, Because what you think of now as her quirks Could very rapidly become destructive. (man) no. They don't know what they're talking about. Joe, please-- no. You want to call my daughter crazy And lock her up somewhere? No. I don't buy it. Let's go. mr. Roberts, please-- thank yofor your time. I'm sorry. You looking for something? sorry. It's an impressive collection you have here. Thanks. Is there something you wanted? You got me thinking this morning, At the discussion of the a.L.S. Trials. I've read about alternative treatments Being used to slow the rate of muscular deterioration. Valine, leucine, isoleucine. Good. You are up on the literature. The results are inconclusive. Would you be interested in studying it furth As an adjunct to fife's work? One group gets his protocol, one control group, of course, And a third group gets amino acids. This... Came to you this morning? Looks like I loosened it up for you. Think about it, dr. Wilder. I will think about it. You want to shake on it? I want you to hold out your hand. Why is that? You couldn't hold the mug this morning, You couldn't open the jar now, And you're here asking for my help. How long have you been sick? I was diagnosed eight years ago. It was in remission till last spring. I'm sorry. Does naomi know? No. I don't intend to let whatever it is we have Be colored by pity. I'm enjoying it. I think I'm entitled. And what about her? I'd ask that you respect my wishes. You're a doctor. You should understand, it's up to the patient To decide when and how to disclose things like this. I'm not your doctor. No, but you work by certain standards Or naomi wouldn't have hired you. Think about the study, pete. I can use all the help I can get. Forget everything that's happened Or hasn't happened between us. What I'm about to say to you is strictly professional As a physician and your business partner. Okay. Your girlfriend sucks. Is that your professional and medical opinion? She's interfering with my patient, Contradicting my medical advice And putting kayla's life at risk. Vanessa was asked for a second opinion. She's a very good doctor. Not as good as I am. What? You want me to pretend that I'm not amazing? Because we both know that I . Look, just ask her to back off. Well, I'm afraid I can't do that. Why not? Because I'm doing kayla's surgery. Pushing through to the inferior vena cava. Nice. Should block any clots from going higher. If they form below the umbrella. You can't let this go?</i> It's my patient on the table, so, no. guys. he's good. Yes. I can imagine it's useful, Having a practice with all these different specialties. You can rely on each other, use each other. Except for when they ignore your medical advice And do what their girlfriends tell them to do. (sam) okay, I am delicately threading A 10-millimeter micromesh umbrella Inside the largest vein of this woman's body. So either be quiet... Or get the hell out. You got it? I got it. He got it. Enough! To all good things. Why are you smiling? Uh, y-you surprise me. I just figured you'd be hammering me about a.L.S. And urgency and giving me the hard sell. Fine. Here's the hard sell. A.L.S. Ravages the body, Patients are left unable to breathe on their own, And eventually suffocate on their own fluids. And to hold off on finding a cure To follow government guidelines that are overly cautious And stalled by bureaucratic red tape? It is beneath the quality of everything we do. Now let's get drunk. So we're--we're-- we're done talking a.L.S.? I hope so. Thamakes for a lousy date. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is not a date. Mm. No, this is a business dinner. Really? A hot guy on eight wheels Sitting across from a beautiful woman? Feels like a date to me. The surgery went okay, you know, But that vanessa is not nice. I mean, maybe she's nice. She's just wrong for sam, you know? (lucas babbling) oh, he's... He's up? I mean, "up" up? Yeah, he's up. Hey, listen, if I told you something And told you you couldn't tell naomi-- I'd tell nai. I tell her everything. Well, you didn't tell her about sam. Yeah, well, that's different. What's the thing? I'm not telling you now. And it's not a thing. It's a concern. Well... You're not spending the night? No, no. He's up, and you're gonna spend some time with him, Some, you know... Family time. Are you freaked out because that woman Thought you were his mother? No. I-I thought it was funny. Funny? Yeah. Addison, where do we stand? Where do we stand? You're. You're asking me just like that? Yeah, I'm asking you just like that. Well, um, you... Are in love with violet. Maybe I could be in love with you. Pete-- maybe we could be more than just you talking incessantly About sam and his girlfriend and running off In the middle of the night because my baby spooks y. That is not what's-- Well, it feels like what's... I... I can't have kids. You have lucas. It's just... I mean, does that make sense? No. Couldn't this be a good thing? I have to go. I can't do this. I can't... We shouldn't do this. Fine. Fine. What do you want, sheldon? I need to ask you something. Did you sleep with me... To spite him? That is a psychologically valid question. I slept with you because you're a nice guy, And you made me laugh, and I was in the mood. Now I realize, you're as childish as he is. Oh, ch--ow, ow. Charlotte. Charlotte, my--my nose is bleeding and my eye is swollen. I mean, I-is that what I get for sleeping with you-- Two orgasms and a bloody nose? I mean, don't you think I deserve something else, You know, for the efforts? Sam! Sam! It's after midnight. What's going on? You shouldn't have done that surgery. You knew I was against it. Vanessa has a different opinion. Yeah? Well, she was wrong! Addison, what-- what is this about? Bad medicine. Really? Because you're acting like a crazy person. Yeah? Well, maybe I am, and maybe... maybe I don't like your girlfriend. (normal voice) maybe I think that she's wrong for you. But you know what? I am right about my patient. That surgery was a mistake. And you know what the sad part is? I'm not even gonna be able to gloat about it, Because it means something bad for a pregnant woman. Addison-- Pete and I got in a fight. He says that I talk about you too much, so... He says he thinks that... He and I could really be something. What about you and vanessa? You think you could... Be something? I don't know. Well... I'm gonna go. Okay. I can't have kids, and pete's got lucas. So that's a little scary. Does that makes sense? You bond with the baby. If you break up, you're devastad. It makes sense. I knew you'd get it. Hey, sheldon. Addison. Coincidence, us both here, Waiting for the elevator, right? I had a feeling. Okay, there's pete and the baby, And then there's sam, who has vanessa. I have an office. Sheldon, focus. Am I stupid or am I a bad person? Because there's this great guy and he's got a great baby, And I really want the baby and I want the guy-- I want to love the guy-- but what am I doing instead? I'm going crazy over sam and vanessa, Who I genuinely think is not a bad person. Although I do think that she might be a bad doctor Because she disagrees with a medical course of treatment That I know to be correct. But... Am I stupid? 'cause I have no right to have feelings for sam. I don't even want to have feelings for sam. He's naomi's ex-husband. He's my friend. What--what the hell is wrong with me? Do you like being with pete? Yes. And do you like to be with lucas? Yes. So you want to be with them, You just don't want to be with them? Beuse of sam. Say something shrink-y. Look, if you come to my office-- short, quick answers. Please. okay. Well, a-a few months ago, U found out that your mother was living a secret life, Hiding her homosexuality from you. And because she was guarding this secret, you feel like You never really knew or bonded with her. What does that have to do with my feelings for pete, The baby and sam? Well, you might be harboring feelings About connecting with a child as that causes you To place yourself in a maternal role, Which could be raising feelis of rejection for you. As well, you likely project pete into the role of your father, Sam into the role of a forbidden connection, Which confuses your feelings for either man. It becomes hard to see past The deep-rooted psychosexual implications Of what you're going through. What? You have mommy issues. What do I do? Well, since I know you're not gonna come to my office And since I also now know that I don't like Being trapped between floors with tall redheads... (chuckles) I'd say, um... What? You see the problem. That's half the battle. It's up to you to choose... To make the right choices, to attempt to be happy, To be loved, to be whole... Without drama and without hurting anyone. Yeah, but how do I do that? Addison, I'm telling you... It's time to grow the hell up. Okay? Okay Okay. What happened to your eye? Cyndy, hey. Uh, come in. Have a seat. Please. I'm glad you came back. I'm sorry if yesterday, You felt, um... Pushed. No. I just, um... I'm sorry. Your--your lip. Are you--are you okay? I had a basketball game. It's a competitive league. Did you bring maggie in? No. I... I shouldn't even be here. Joe doesn't know that I came. I used to think he was right. You know, she's just different than the other kids. But over the past year, it's gotten worse. Not just since the move. Even before. I came home from... Work once, And I found her... Sitting on my bed, Just...  Star. So I went and I made dinner And I did some laundry, and... When I came back two hours later... She hadn't moved an inch. She's slipping away from me.Um, And joe refuses to see it. But I'm there every day. And I'm afraid that dr. Wallace may be right. And I don't know what to do. You have a look on your face. Addison. We had... No, it wasn't even really a fight. I don't know what it was. Pete, you know what I'm gonna say. Just give her the benefit of the doubt. What? I'm biased. She's my best friend. Good morning. Hey, I thought you were out of the office with meetings today. Well, I wanted to see you, hear about last night. Make sure you didn't hold a grudge For me sticking you with fife. He behaved himself, I hope. Let's just say that he was, um, persistent. Well, good. Good. I'll see you later. Okay. Dr. Wilder. You like him. William? Yeah. Yeah, we're dating. How well do you know him? Well enough. Why? Oh, no reason. I was just wondering. Look... About last night... Did you talk to pete yet? Not yet, no. I-- Addie. I need to... Uh... What? Uh, n--uh, sam and I were just discussing a case. Okay. Addie, I-I want to talk to you about some, uh, William/fife stuff, so... Sure. Addison... It's about kayla. She--she was talking, Then she--she just, uh, started gasping for air. Looks like a small clot moved into her lung. I thought you said You were able to block the clots from moving. I was. This means she's forming other clots above the umbrella. Is she gonna be okay? I'm gonna remove the stress on her system now. Prep an o.R. I have to reduce the pregnancy load. You didn't answer my question. Is she gonna be okay? I'm gonna do everything I can. Tell me more about eli. What kind of things do you two do together? Lots of stuff. Sometimes eli wants to play on the computer</i> And sometimes we go for hikes. I don't like this.</i> We should be in there with her. Just let him talk to her. (sheldon) do you go with other friends? He's gonna get her confused,</i> Make her say what he wants us to hear. No, no. No one has an agenda. We're just trying to help your daughter. Well, that sounds like fun.</i> Most of the time. What about the other times? I don't know. Is it stuff you don't like to do? Who gets to decide what you do? Eli. I try not to listen, but... He doesn't like it when I ignore him. What things does eli say? Is he talking to you now? He's angry. He doesn't want me to tell you about the bad stuff. Maggie, I know this is hard. But you can tell me. I won't let him hurt you. Eli didn't like me spending time with munchie. Who's munchie? My cat. Eli was jealous. He wanted munchie to go away. He told me that munchie wanted to go into the lake. So I took him to the one behind our house. And then he told me to just hold him there, Underwater. And he fought, and he scratched...</i> but I did what eli told me... Until... He stopped moving. Oh, my god. I thought it ran away. She's upset. He is upsetting her. I want this stopped now! Joe, this isn't gonna stop, not unless we help her. I am not locking up my daughter. I want this stopped! I wanted to help them. I believed I was right. So please spare me the condescending "we all make bad calls" speech. I've heard it before. That's not what I was gonna say. I was gonna say that you screwed up. You screwed up royally, and now I have to clean up your mess. So you can scrub in with me if you want, But in my o.R., you will shut up and do as your told. Okay, that felt personal. It wasn't. Are you really mad at me or sam? Maybe before I was really mad at sam. But now that my patient might die Because of your bad call, I'm really mad at you. And how are you on this fine day, dr. Wilder? Let me ask you a question. Before yesterday, before... William gave you the green light, Were you gonna proceedmore caut? This is not me being reckless. The man who signs our paychecks is comfortable There are no issues here. If you knew that william had his own agenda That had nothing to do with yours And that's why he has you moving fast, Would that change anything? What agenda? Just do it right, okay? What agenda? He needs the treatment for himself. (taps fingers) does naomi know? No. Why are you telling me this? Because this should be done right. Whatever your agenda is, I'm counting on you to do the right thing. you're angry. You're angry at me, and I'm sorry. But I also see that you're scared. I am not scared. Seeing this happen to a child you love is scary, And knowing what someone you love is capable of is scary. What's scary is you. You want to lock up a little girl, Take her away from us a-and make her different. No one is talking about taking her away. Yeah, that's what you say now. And thenand you don't let usr and yosee her again. And I won't allow that. No, I won't! Joe-- No! Who did they take away from you, joe? Joe? My sister. But I... I thought your sister died. Joe, what happened to your sister? She started, uh, hearing voices. God was talking to her. My parents took her to the doctors. And... They took her away. They locked her up and they called her crazy, And she killed herself. Oh, honey. Why didn't you tell me? Because it's my fault that maggie's sick. It's in my family. It's in my blood. And if they'd just let her be, It would've been fine. I'm sorry for what happened. But treatment has evolved. They don't just lock up people with this disease And throw away the key. We can find medications and work therapeutically, And you'll be right there with her Every step of the way. you can't ignore it. You can't pretend it's not happening. If you accept it, it can get better. She can get better. Spinal needle and k.C.L. Adjusting the probe. pulse ox is 86. She's throwing p.V.C.S. She's throwing another clot, a big one. All right. Raise the oxygen to 100. We need to get her off the table, into I.C.U. I've lost her pulse. She's in fib. Crash cart. Uh, I wanted to talk to you about the drug protocol. I was just thinking about that, actually. I was, um, I was just sitting here thinking about maya. And I was thinking about what you said, About how horrible this disease is And how could I let someone suffer. And if that were somebody that I loved... I looked over your protocol top to bottom, And it looks good. So if you and william are okay with it, I'm in. I thought you'd be appreciative. I am, uh, but, uh, I also considered your argument. And while I appreciate the green light, I-I don't know that whatwi, U-unless we do this... The right way. Get the proper approvals, make sure. What can I say? You're rubbing off on me. Gabriel... Wait. What? Can you raise the chair? Higher. Will you.. Okay. What? Uh, I... Just, um... I, uh... Is she okay? Tell me she's okay. Eddie, uh... The clot went into her lung, and her heart stopped. It took us five minutes to get it started beating again. But her brain was without oxygen. There's no evidence of higher level brain activity. I'm sorry. sh-she's dead? She's in a coma on life support. I'm so sorry, eddie. And the baby... The one that's left? We never got to the procedure. All three babies, they're stable. What... What does that mean? It means that so long as kayla is on the ventilator, The babies will continue to grow. she said... She said this was too dangerous. She said that kayla could die, and--and you talked her into it. You said she would be okay. I'm sorry. No, you--you killed her. You killed my wife. You killed my wife! I, uh, owe you an apology. Some things are hard to accept, right? I get that. You know, before yesterday, I never struck another person. Oh, yeah? Well, not a bad right cross for a shrink. Thank you. Pete. I'll be right in. I'm tired of making the wrong choices. I've done thatoo much. I want to make the right choice. What are you saying? Maybe I could be in love with you, too. Yeah? Yeah. I wanted to apologize for last night. It was juvenile. I was juvenile. And I could lie and blame it on endorphins from a fight. But... It was just me being stupid and insecure. I mean, you know, a beautiful woman like you, I wasn't sure-- Sheldon. Yeah. Shut up. I heard about kayla. You okay? This is me, gloating. I'm sorry. Me, too. I really am, sam. Being right is all well and good, But it's not... Much fun. How's vanessa? She's all right. Good. She made a bad call. Yeah. We all make bad calls. You and I were a bad call. yeah. Talked to pete. Did you tell him that you wanted to be with him? Yeah, I'm just... We're just gonna try, You know, we're gonna see if it works... Attempt to be happy. That's good. I'm trying to grow the hell up, sam. I want you to be happy. I want you to be happy, too. Addison. I was coming up here to... Tell you what happened to me today, But it seems like all the real action is up here. No, no. Nai, not at all. Nothing ever happened. We... We kissed, nai,
