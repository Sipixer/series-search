Oh, you just... You bring something out in me. Well, I'd like to think it's the best in you. Or the worst. Archer. Why are you being such a tease? What are you doing? Archer? You're okay. You're okay. Private Practice S02E15 Acceptance - That's good. She's at plus-2 station. - That's good. Where's Naomi? She promised she'd come. We paged her. Hopefully she'll come. But we promise you, Maggie, you're in very good hands. I have everything under control. But she's my good luck charm. Where is she? - Don't give me that look. I'm fine. - You're not fine. You had a seizure. Blood pressure's 120 over 80. Pulse... regular and 70. Eyes... equal and responsive. - You know you need... - No tests. I don't even need to be here. I told you that. I told the paramedics that. A healthy person your age does not just have a a tonic-clonic seizure out of the blue. Actually, that's not true. I'm the badass brain guy. Yes, I had a seizure. And while I could lecture you on the fact that the brain is a complex organ firing off neurons and electrical impulses which occasionally short-circuit for totally benign reasons, instead, I'm signing myself out. - What, against all medical advice? - Against your medical advice, which makes you my doctor, so you have doctor-patient confidentiality. What? Wait, wait... You want me to lie to Addison? - You need to see someone. - I'm fine. No, you're doctor. You know better. You need to see Addison or Naomi about the pregnancy today. And you sound like crap. I didn't know you were moving in to be the pregnancy police. I am your friend, and I'm helping you out, and I have the added benefit of being a highly trained physician. So as long as you are preg... Together again. - Look, we're not... - Of course not. That was humor. It just seems... well, the office, the elevator, your house, together... it's... - It's nice. - Yes. It is nice. - We're friends. - Of course. You called me the other day. I'm sorry. I should've... We're all busy people. You'll call me, when you have time. Oh, look... The happy couple. This has gotta stop. We have to talk. When you can explain moving in with Violet, we will. If you knew why, you would see that it's actually right. If I knew why, which I don't. So right now, you are nothing but a guy who moved in with another woman. Why is it taking so long? - She's still at plus-2. - What does that mean? It means that the labor's not progressing and the baby has variable decels we're gonna need to perform an assisted delivery to help guide the baby out. It's very safe. Dell would you prep the vacuum extractor, please? - Vacuum what?! - It's gonna be fine, honey. - I've never done one of these. - It's okay. I'll guide you through it. Okay, place the cup directly on the vertex. Now, Maggie, when I tell you, I need you to push as hard as you can, and while you push, we will take the baby out, okay? Ready? And push. That's great, Maggie. - The baby's crowning. - Take it out! - It's a girl. It's a baby girl. - Congratulations. The discoloration on her head? It's just a hematoma. It happens sometimes with a vacuum delivery. - Her apgar is low. - Dell, don't worry. She's fine. You did great. Wait... I thought you and Charlotte were back together. - We were. - So what happened? Well, I... She's... - It's complicated. - Well - You know what I like about Sonya? - She's not complicated? - She says exactly what she thinks. - Well, be careful what you wish for. What are you doing here? I thought I was meeting you at the hospital later. Mom said we should come here before surgery. Were is she? She went to go get money and she's not back yet. I have to go to the bathroom, bad. It's... right down the hall to your left. Thanks. Oh, I forgot. Mom said I should give you this. - What? What's wrong? - Her parents... They dumped her. They're not coming back. You're here. I paged you. Jake and Maggie Klein were asking for you. They had their baby. Beth. - That's wonderful. Wonderful. - You're okay? Yeah, I just... I... had a rough morning. Look, if my brother's causing you trouble, just dump him. Come on. That was supposed to be funny. Yeah, I... You know what? Can you excuse me a minute? I hate lies. Something is wrong. I'm fine. Close the door. I'll show you how fine I am. It's not funny. If you were fine, you would've let the doctor examine you today. You would've let them run tests. So what is it? Is it an aneurysm or a stroke or... A.V.M.? - Who's the neurologist here? - You won't tell me what's going on, and I'm thinking the worst here. You don't know how scary it was for me this morning. - I'm sorry. - Sorry isn't gonna make me feel better. Sorry is not gonna make me not worry. You need to tell me what's wrong. I can help you. Come on. We can... we can figure it out. It's a tumor... a glioma in the third ventricle of my brain. - Can... - It's inoperable. There's nothing they can do. There's something I... want to tell Addison, - but I can't. - You can't? I was asked specifically by someone not to tell. You were asked specifically by someone not to tell Addison something specific? Okay... to a week ago, I would've said Pete, maybe Coop. But this definitely reeks of Archer. It... involves doctor-patient confidentiality. Which would apply if you were Archer's doctor, which you're not, unless he's trying to get pregnant. I'm sorry. You're not giving me much to go on here. It's something medical. So... do you keep a secret for a man that you care about, or do you lie to your best friend? - How's she doing? - She isn't responding to the pacifier, and... she's barely cried, and... the bruise, it looks worse. Well, her color's good. She's active. Let's see those feet. She responds to stimulation. Maybe you should order a C.T. or an M.R.I. just to be sure. This is all within the range of normal after an assisted delivery. But if there's a chance something's wrong, I... something you could... - I just, I want her to be okay. - I know you do, and so do I. But this baby isn't sick. Patty's parents aren't answering their phone, and there's no contact information for their work or for their cells. - How did she hurt her knee? - Car accident. She was 5. Hit-and-run internal injuries, which, you know, she got over. Walking has been hard. We had to wait for the bone to grow more before we could reconstruct the knee. And her parents just walked out the day of the surgery? Patty is out there reading to her Teddy bear. I haven't told her yet. I told her her parents were still at the bank and that things were taking longer than they should. She knows something's wrong. You know that. Kids know when something's wrong. - You have to report this. - Her parents - are good people. - They bandoned a sick child. Child and family services needs to be involved. And the police. The safe haven program is for babies. This is abandonment. Her parents are having financial problems. Maybe they're just freaked out by the surgery. Just give me a few hours. I'll find them. The surgery's elective. If we turn her over to family services, they won't pay for it, and she needs the surgery. She needs her parents. Well, not all parents should be parents. So if you want to, go look for them, but... let me talk to her first. Let's make sure this family is worth being put back together. So Dr. Cooper... is he, like, your best friend? What about you? - You have a best friend? - Felix. And does felix live at home with you and your family? What does a family look like? Can you show me with the dolls? There's a momm and a daddy and me... and Felix. So I'm gonna start a sentence, and I want you to finish it, okay? So i'll say... I like it when my mommy... - and then you say... - Hugs me. And I don't like it when my mommy... Gets sad. And what about the daddy? What does the daddy do? A daddy comes home at night. And what does he do when he comes home at night? He crawls into bed with me. And what does he do when he crawls into bed with you? Sometimes he reads me a story, but most of the time, he just snores. - I need to tell you something. - Something good or something bad? Something bad. Archer asked me not to tell you, but... what did he do to you? Last night, Archer had a seizure. And it's not the first seizure he's had, Addison. It's cancer... a glioma. It's... Inoperable. He says he saw everyone in New York... C.T. scans, second opinions, third opinions... and he says that there is nothing to do. - Where is he now? - He's downstairs. He says he doesn't want to talk about it. Right. Well, we'll get... his scans from New York. We'll figure out exactly what it is and how we fight it. You can't Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Nai. I'm his sister, I'm a doctor, and there's always something hat we can do. - So? - Everything she demonstrated... concept of family structure, parent-child roles... suggests that the family life is healthy. - So if I can find 'em... - Go find 'em. Could I borrow you for a few minutes? It's... kind of important. Addison, I am so sorry. I saw him yesterday on the elevator. He was fine. Don't talk about him like he's dead. Have you talked to him? I'm trying to get his scans from New York. I need ammunition. If you give me some "stages of grief" crap, I will throw something. Okay, look, I don't need the super friends here, okay? I don't need moral support. I'm fine he's not, and I'm gonna fix it. Well... Nai says he's taking it well. He's every creating drama like he always does. Secrets... I know he doesn't want help, but he's gotta be scared. I know I would be. I mean, look at all of us. None of us wants to think that... Got it. What, his scans? They released them to you? After 15 phone calls to every hospital in New York, ten calls to every neurologist and one very effective e-mail to the doctor who wrote the preface to Archer's last book. You wanted a consult on... - You convened a panel? - The doctor says it's operable. One thought so. Three doctors said no. They'd have to tear through half of my brain to get this. - What about chemo? - Radiation? Chemo is not proven effective with this kind of lesion, and radiation would fry all brain tissue before it made a dent. - I'd lose my sense of humor. - You can't just give up. I'm not giving up. At the rate this is growing, I could have 5 years... five great years, and I get to keep all my hair. - I'll adjust my seizure medication. - What if it's not slow growing? What if, instead of a couple of years, it's a couple of months or worse? When was your last C.T. scan? You know her. She's not gonna give up on this. These were my last. They were taken... Three weeks ago. They followed a set from two months ago and another set before that. Wait, read that date again. This time, don't tilt your head. What? He has an upward gaze palsy. Sam's right. You can't look up. But that's not consistent with third-ventricle glioma, is it? Well, what else could it be? We need to do another C.T. scan. We need to do it now. - She's beautiful, isn't she? - Very. - How are you feeling? - Beat up... But happy. Jake went home to take a shower. Thanks for taking care of her so I could get some sleep. Has she... has she nursed yet? Is there something wrong, Dell? Everything's fine. Okay, here. You should've told me. What, you moved to L.A. Because you want to be closer to me? And it's a lie. You lied. You knew you were sick. You knew and you didn't tell me. - What were you thinking? - I wanted to make up for lost time. By lying to me when I can help you? And then you tell Naomi? She saw the seizure. I didn't have a choice. Whatever's going on, there is something in my brain that can't come out. And now that you know, everything's about me dying. You got that look in your eye, that underlying pity. - It's not pity. - It is and I didn't want to come here and look at you every day - And see that - You are my brother, You're the only family I have - the only sane family... - We're ready. This is really gonna make your knee feel better, okay? It's okay. You don't have to be scared. - It doesn't hurt that much. - He is really brave. - What's his name again? - Felix. You know what, Felix? We... are... done. So if your parents had trouble at the bank, - Who do you think they'd call? - I don't know. Do your mom and dad have a good friend they talk to a lot or... My mom talks to aunt Katie. Is that your mom's sister? Do you know where she lives? Near Disneyland. Did something happen to them? Did they get into an accident? - Are they dead? - No... God, no. Your parents... I think they're going through a tough time, and, They need to figure some things out. You're lying. It's almost twice the size. And there are two more lesions on the cortex. A tumor wouldn't expand that quickly. No, it wouldn't. Is it metastatic? Not in this position. - Multifocal abscess? - No fever, no source. Then... What? Well, maybe... - Zihuatanejo. - What? Zihuatanejo. I was there six months ago for a book junket. - What are you talking about? - It's not tumors. - Neurocysticercosis. - Parasites? Parasites. I have parasites in my brain. Forgot what it was like in the side of thinks just being... I'm here in a waiting room. Bud*** gaz tests confirms it A mass of a parasistic cysts. - I'm calling Derek he can take him out. - I mean, I haven't a tumor, but it still in my third ventricle this does'nt change that. But you thought you had five years. These lesions are warm sacs in your brain They can burst at any moment and you could die Or, I can take any parasitics instead it to kill them They'd might kill him, they could also send your immune system into overdrive. You end up with brain swelling, more seizures. Which would rupture the remaining cysts. Do you realize how lucky you were last night that that didn't happen? On the other hand, the drugs could cure me. All due respect to your ex-husband, even in Derek's hands, there's a 1-in-4 chance I'm a vegetable. Or I could die on the table or I could die from complications. You're a surgeon. It's your instinct to cut, not mine. Addison, he... has a right to make his own decision. Come on, Nai. What, you've been sleeping with him for a few weeks and now you're on his side? It's his field and it's his life. - It's risky, but... - Drugs can work. I'm sorry. Derek may be your answer, but he's not mine. This isn't your choice. I delivered a baby today, and... I think I did something wrong. - And... you want to tell me about it? - I just... I placed the vacuum too low, I think. I used too much force, and... she's got this... Like, red mark. And I'm afraid there might be bleeding in the brain. - What does Addison say? - That she's fine. But she won't do a C.T. scan and she won't check, and... and now she's not even here. You asked for a diagnosis, and she gave it Now she's gotta focus on her brother. Who is getting every test under the sun, which is great, it's great, but, you know, why can't the baby that I delivered get just one? You know what I think? I think that you want her to run a test to treat your anxiety and not the baby. If Addison says the baby is healthy, then accept it. Whatever you did worked. You okay? Can I trust you with something? I can't believe it. - You, pregnant. - I don't want anyone to know. What about the father? I mean, does he know? It's complicated. Well, you don't owe me any explanations. It could be Pete or it could be Sheldon. Keeping it local. That's... Cool. Look at that. - I don't see anything. - That's the heart. - Is it beating? - Strong. Good cardiac activity. Rate of 150. Everything looks good. The cramping's probably just from your uterus expanding. It's nothing to worry about. Oh, my god. I'm actually pregnant. That's a... that's a baby. That's... my baby. That is a tiny human being. Your pulse is racing. I need you to breathe. I'm... I'm pregnant. I'm... I mean, there's... You've having a panic attack. Concentrate on my breathing, okay? Slow and easy. Deep breaths. In... And out. How did you find us? Told me about your sister. It wasn't that hard to find the address. You shouldn't have come here. That's it? You see me standing here, you... - Got nothing to say? - I'm... sorry. You're her parents. Maybe you lost your house, and maybe things are bad, and... there are probably things I don't know, things that make your life excruciatingly hard, but Patty loves you. And this surgery, she needs it. - She needs you. - We can't. - You're good people. - We're not. I've known you since your daughter was 6 hours old, - through the accident, through rehab... - And all of that ruined us. The bills, they never end, day after day. We don't have the money. - Our insurance is gone. - I can talk to the hospital. It's too much, Cooper. She's too much for us. We can't do it anymore. I know what you must think of us... But - we're done. - That's it? You're done? That lite girl is smart and strong, and she survived a car accident and all the surgeries and all the pain, and for a kid like that, I would walk over broken glass to help her... You are done. You don't deserve her. Looks like you're good at your job. I'm not a doctor, but yes, I know a thing or two about pregnant women. - So my cramps? - Aren't about the baby. What are you talking about? I have an alien being growing inside of me. It's not the only thing growing inside you. I mean, keeping this a secret, not telling Pete or Sheldon... the guilt, the anxiety, it grows, and it'll swallow you up. It's not good for you or the baby, okay? You need to tell them. I can't. Not now. Don't forget these. When I was 7, I fell off my bike. Do you remember? We were on the vineyard... Not just fell off, we were going downhill and my tire came loose, and I went over the handlebars and I... I scraped my whole face. Remember? We were about a half-mile from home, and you... you picked me up... You told me it was gonna be okay, and you carried me home. You weren't even that big. But you were my big brother, and you knew I was scared... And you carried me home. Who's gonna carry me home if you die? I fix things, Archie. It's what I do. I want to fix this for you. Some things you can't fix. They're not coming, are they? I'm sorry. I know it's not what you want to hear. It's not what I want to be telling you. But it doesn't mean that they don't love you. It just means that right now... They can't be here. It's okay. I need a favor, Charlotte. I need three more nurses, six more hours in a day, mandatory martinis at lunch to know why the man I was sleeping with is - living with another woman. - I have a little girl who's scheduled to have surgery at St. Ambrose today. - I need it to happen. - The problem is? Her parents signed all the pre-op forms and all's good to go. They abandoned her This is what D.C.F. sis for. You call, they take the kid. And then she never gets the surgery. She was in an accident at 5. She limps. She has back problems. She crushed her knee. It needs to be reconstructed. It's considered elective surgery. D.C.F.S. won't pay for it. The parents are required to sign their children in, period. - Risk management requires it. - And if we just assume that they did? You waltz in here and expect me to violate hospital ethics, to essentially commit fraud, for you, who won't even break Violet's confidence for me? You're mad at me. I probably deserve it. But there is a girl who's been sitting alone in my office for eight hours waiting for a surgery to change her life, a surgery that she doesn't get unless we skip a step in the process and just let things progress the way they're supposed to. Don't help me. Help her. It's all right, Violet. Just... - say it. - Whatever it is, just... Right. Good. Just say it. I'm pregnant. I know. It's crazy. It's wrong. It's... awful. But I want to be clear that I have no expectations here. I know neither of you want kids, so you don't have to worry. I actually don't know whose it is, which is... crazy, I know, but... but whichever it turns out to be, it is not your responsibility, it's mine. And there's nothing that you need to do. Cooper has moved in with me. He's looking after me. It'll all be taken care of. So now you know. Okay? This is how you want to handle this? You think that this is how either of us wants to handle this? Divide and conquer, isn't that right, Violet? You don't want a conversation about this. You've decided what we want and how we feel and how we'll react and what we'll say, so you... just drop this bomb in front of both of us. - I didn't want to say anything until... - you decided on your own without consulting anyone, anyone who... might... So I take it that you're going to keep it. I'm gonna keep it. And now i'm gonna be sick. You are gonna love me. A 1945 bord... Call 9-1-1! That's it, Archer. You're okay... The paralyzing agent has caed his body, but the seizures aren't stopping. They'll stop. Neurologist says they may not. He's not your brother, but he's good. He knows what he's doing. How long before the seizures cause permanent neurological damage? There's no way to know, but given the intensity and the duration, - I don't think we have a lot of time. - Time for what? He wants to use a general, induce coma. Put Archer's brain to sleep. It'll stop the seizure cycle. He may not come out of that. He's not coming out of statuts either. But the longer we let these seizures go on, then the bigger the chance that everything that makes Archer. Archer... gets burned away. I'll do it. This is gonna help you, Archie. It'll help you rest. There we go. He needs the surgery to remove the parasite. Archer doesn't want it. He was very clear about that. That was before this. He went into status because the parasitic sack shifted. - Maybe. We don't know that. - We don't have time to try the drugs. The drugs are too risky. - If we started the drugs immediately... - It's not fast enough. It'd take a week, maybe ten days even. That... that's what they said. I am as scared as you are of losing him, but we have to respect his wishes. I'm tired of respecting him. I want to save him. I want to call Derek. Archer said no, and if you go down that road... I will not accept that we are supposed to just stand by and watch him die. It's my choice. I'm making it. Make the call. Come on... I need you. I know all about the five stages of grief. I'm trying to figure out the five stages of shock. I'm pissed. Kind of. I don't know. You don't know? You don't know how you feel? - Do you? - Like I said, I'm pissed. She kept it from... us. But how do you feel about... She's gonna have a kid, yours or mine. Is it true that you don't want kids? I'm sorry. I had no right to ask. I just... I'm reeling. I... Kids just don't seem to like me. I wish they did. I've always like them. They just... Don't like me, and maybe... If it were mine... I wanted kids a lot a long time ago. But I told myself it was better... That I didn't have them. But it's not... better. - She just woke up screaming. - We can't calm her down. What's wrong? Did we do something? I think... she's hungry. Look at her. She's perfect. She is. - Am I better? - The surgery went well. - It went really, really well. - My knee won't hurt? I predict that you will be dancing and anything else you want. Patty, I wanted to introduce someone to you. She's gonna make sure that you're taken care of. This is... this is Michelle. And... She's a friend of ours. She's really nice. And she's from a place called... child and family services. They take care of kids when their moms and dads can't. But what about you... and Violet? Can't you... I'm sorry, Patty. I wish we could. I've heard a lot about you. I hear you're doing really well. - I just want to go home. - I know. Michelle's gonna keep you safe. And she's gonna help you get through this. You and Felix are gonna watch out for one another. And I'll still be your doctor. I heard. Called social services soon as she went under, and the police. And Violet. It's been a terrible day, Charlotte. I looked that girl's parents in the eye, and... They do not care. And the surgery is good. The surgery is gonna help. But at the end of the day, that girl... Doesn't have parents anymore. The only thing I can think of that might make me feel any better... Is being with you. I know being with you would make me feel better. Violet's pregnant. That's the secret. That's why i'm moving in with her... Because she's freaking out. Are you... Is it your... I'm not the father. I'm the best friend. Violet has... always been there for me. She shouldn't have to do it alone. What about me? - I love you. - What about me when I have our baby? Your first child was supposed to be with me. Those moments were supposed to be ours. Enjoy your first child, Cooper. They say there's nothing like it. So you gonna keep the baby? You know what? I think I might be a pretty good midwife. I think you are. The medevac's gonna meet us at Santa Monica airport. We'll be in Seattle in less than three hours, and in the O.R. 45 minutes later. You're gonna be okay. You are. You better get better. Come with me. He'd want you there. I need you there. Go. I got Maya. Go.
