full hospital privileges. Transplant team's standing by. Sarah's sister's inside. How much time do we have? She'll go into full renal failure within 72 hours Without the sister's kidney. It's not a perfect match, but the next best thing. D--oh, hi. Hi. Come on. Oh, I don't get my kidney until I dish? That's right. Uh, seattle grace is merging with mercy west, Which means half the doctors in the city are out of a job. I'm getting a divorce, which means I'm a single mom. Stevens has cancer. Meredith and derek got married on a post-it note. And george o'malley is dead, but you knew that already. (sighs) Um, I don't sleep much anymore because I lay awake at night And wonder where all the joy is. During the day, I realize that the joy packed its bags and left. The glasses of t world are half-empty. But... You're an attending. I am an attending. How are you? I-- dr. Bailey. Ah, this is our chief of staff, dr. Charlotte king. Oh, I appreciate the professional courtesy. I hear you have a nice little hospital here. We're small but efficient. You came to the best place to get the job done... Mm. Right this time. The donor's a single mom with three small children And an ex-husband who likes to hit things. Jumping on a plane out of state's not an option. Otherwise, seattle grace would have been the obvious choice, Cutting-edge teaching hospital and all. Here at st. Ambrose, you'll find the doctors don't need teaching. They already know what they're doing. Excuse me. Sorry about that. She's a little, uh... I don't have to like her. I just need her o.R. Dr. Bailey. Well, well, well. Look at you. Why are we looking at me? No, I just meant that... I didn't mean... Hello. What are we waiting for? Where's my kidney? (clears throat) Bailey's here. Sync by honeybunny (addison) sam's agreed to be internist to both sisters. Emily, this is dr. Bailey. She'll be performing The transplant. I'm ready. Okay, well, first we'll take you through The pre-surgery protocol. You already have my file. I was tested as a partial match three years ago. Sarah needs my kidney now. Your sister's stabilized. If we do this tomorrow, we should be fine. Sarah fought to stay alive for three excruciating years While you waited to find a match. Now somebody screwed up, and she's dying. She's done waiting. I'm done waiting. Sarah's gone through a tremendous amount Of physical trauma in the last 24 hours. She just got off an air ambulance. Her system was fragile even before she had The failed organ transplant. Now, hey, I'm the first to admit, we made mistakes. But we will not rush her into another surgery Before we've got a whole slew of tests telling us That she's strong enough to handle it. We do this right, or we don't do it at all. Yes, I'm... I'm sorry. It's just... It's my sister. Well, I'm going to fix this. (footsteps approach) Welcome back. Oh, thank you, sheldon. (chuckles) (laughs) How are ya? No, no, not therapeutically. I mean just as friends. You know, when someone mes back to work, It's a friendly question, you know, so... Well, letting that go. (chuckles) (chuckles) How's the baby? You found a good nanny? I gave him to pete. What? I gave the baby to pete. To babysit? To--to visit? To--to what? To live. To be. To... I... Gave him to pete. Lucas could be my son. I know. He is your son, and you gave him to pete? You gave him to pete? It was... (sighs) for the best. It's for the best? I-I have no words. There are no words. Words are not enough! Sheldon, sheldon, this is my first day back. I am... Doing the best I can. Could you just go? Can you go? Well, I-- can you just-- 'cause it would really help if you would just...</i> Luke is living with you? Shh. Lucas is trying to sleep. So... So violet just gave him to you? What's going on, pete, with violet? She's working on things. Don't worry, sheldon. Lucas is fine. Okay. Everything looks good. Now we're gonna let teresa take a blood sample from you. Uh, my blood type is a-b, I'm r-h positive, And I'm a scorpio. What more do you need to know? Probably nothing. But why don't you let us do our job So dr. Bailey can do hers? Is she good--dr. Bailey? Because after what happened in seattle-- dr. Bailey is one of the best. She seems a little, um... Cold. (laughs) she's a surgeon. Uh, you want her to be quick, decisive, and she's both. She's good. You have nothing to worry about. I have three kids to worry about. Uh, sarah saved us... All of us. I married a bad guy, and I couldn't get out. I just... Watched my life Turn into this terrible place. Then sarah flew in. She took care of the kids, stayed with us for six months And made sure we were all safe. My babies don't have a dad. They don't have grandparents. They have me and they have sarah. (voice breaks) we need her. You're giving up an organ. We don't take that lightly. Okay. Oh, hey. You're good with her. Thanks. How's the sister? Oh, she's stable for now. And you're comfortable with this match? It wasn't a good match three years ago, But with all the progress in anti-rejection drugs, We'll make it work. Hey, it's all we got. Okay. How are those anxiety attacks? Asthma. Right. It was asthma. Ryan's driving me crazy. I keep telling him at it takes time To build a new immune system from scratch, but-- But he's 16, and he's living in suburban jail. Not that it's not beautiful. (air hisses) (hiss) My man. Do you know how many things you can't do While your mother is watching every second? (cooper) yeah, 2,563. Two years, coop. Almost two years in a bubble. Yeah, with digital cable And wi-fi, dvr, dvd. There are a lot of people that would call that heaven. You want me to grow up to be a eunuch? Spill it. (clears throat) homecoming, tomorrow. Kelli's going, I'm n, and francis stokes is. She'd kiss a guy named francis? Okay, look, you're gonna get outta here. It's not like the old days, when being born Without an immune system meant you have to stay In a place like this forever. You are getting better, But we gotta be really careful with scids.</i> And, you know, I know that this kissing stuff feels important-- coop, I know 16 was a long time ago, But you have a girlfriend. You have sex. I have talk and talk. And talk is starting to get really... Old, Like you. That's funny. You know, talk can actually be hard to come by. I think my girlfriend could take some lessons from yours. (computer chirps) ry.</i> Hey, ry. How's the bubble boy?</i> She won't be my girlfriend for long. Isn't there something more you can do to get me outta here? (miranda) I feel like I'm in a spa. When will the waiter come by with champagne? (laughs) Addison... Uh, dr. Bailey. How are you? Naomi. Right. Uh, I thought you left the practice. Uh, I did. Naomi went downstairs to run a different practice. I, uh, I tried to call you, twice. I know. I'm sorry. I've just been crazy busy. I just came up to, you know, welcome violet back. (elevator bell dings) Thought the two of you were best friends. We were. We are. Uh, I just... Oh, cooper, cooper, uh, this is, uh, dr. Bailey, My friend from seattle. Oh, hey, wow. Wow. You're shorter than-- than I thought. I mean, given what sam says, and addison, about... That's--it's a compliment. Um... I have twins waiting. Hope he's better with kids than adults. Mm. (chuckles) Oh, violet. Our therapist. Dr. Bailey. Oh, hi. Well, I... Wait. So is she the one you said had the baby And then... Yeah. (gasps) she's back at work? Mm-hmm. Oh, if that had happened to me, I'd be spending my time in a padded room. Oh, is that the father? Yeah. Well, one of 'em. T-there's another one? It's complicated. (laughs) this place is better than a telenovela. It's not a telenovela. (laughs) Addison? Dr. Montgomery. Morgan. Is everything okay? What's--what's wrong? Did you do it? Did you sleep with my husband? Uh, ahem. Morgan, let's, uh-- uh, I k--he says you didn't. And I-I just want to believe you didn't, You being my doctor and all, But then I found myself outside your building. And I knew if I didn't ask you... Tell me. Morgan, no. I promise you, nothing like that ever happened. He's telling you the truth. I-I-I believe you. I'm sorry. I have to go. Go ahead. Get it off your chest. I have nothing to say. He was a heart surgeon. She was my patient. It's none of my business. There was no sex at all. Nothing. Okay, well, we--we-- we went to first base. Maybe second. Se--somewhere between first and second base-- I do not want to know about your bases or your balls. It's none of my business. Miranda, it's you. It's me. I know you.</i> I know you have something to say.</i> (knock on door) excuse me. We got emily's tests back. Oh, good. Bad. Why? What happened? Emily can't donate her kidney. (knock on door) Excuse me. Emily, could I speak with you for a moment? Told you they'd find out. Wait. So you're aware of-- of emily's status? She's my sister. She knows everything about me. So it was only your doctors you were keeping the secret from-- The fact that you're h.I.V. Positive? Doesn't matter. The transplant n to happen. You said it yourself, dr. Bailey. I'm out of time. I'd rather get a.I.D.S. Than die. I can't believe they lied. Well, can you blame 'em? Can you put sarah back on dialysis? No, no. We're at the end of the line. I called the national kidney registry, But, you know, she's been waiting three years for a match. They don't have one. What about a cadaver donor? No match. Nothing close. We just hope someone dies between now and the morning Or we... Give sarah emily's kidney. (chuckles) yeah. You can't transplant an h.I.V.-Infected organ. If you put h.I.V into her body And then bombard her immune system With anti-rejection drugs, She's not just looking at living with h.I.V. She could develop full-blown a.I.D.S. Before she even leaves the hospital. She could. Or she could live with h.I.V. For the rest of her life and be fine. What about emily? She's already been compromised. I mean, is there data that tells us What losing a kidney does to someone with h.I.V.? What part of "there is no time" do you not understand? What part of "illegal" do you not understand? Oh, the laws were created years ago, Back when h.I.V. Was a death sentence. They're outdated. Out-- It's not relevant. A.I.D.S. Is treatable now, okay? Death isn't. You are playing god. I'm a surgeon. It's how we pass the time. Dr. Bailey, we both want to save your patient. But you can't expect me to back you on this. I'm putting my foot down. Okay? My--my--my foot is down. Your foot is down? Your foot is down? Oh, oh, no. You better pick that foot up And use it to walk away from me. (cooper) you're the infectious disease guy. You gotta help me out here. There's gotta be something. He's not ready yet. It's one dance. And then his girl's gonna be there with some other guy. Lisa baxter--she was my lab partner in chem, Which was great, because normally a guy like me Would not have a chance with a girl like lisa. But, you know, I made her laugh, so we got to talk. And she realized my inherent charms. Anyway... I get up the nerve to ask her to winter formal, And she says yes right before my parents tell me That we're going to des moines to my cousin ira's bar mitzvah. My heart's breaking, coop. Okay, well, that was it. By the time I got back, She was dating this beefy guy named ted, And I never got my shot. Are we doing this for you or for him? Oh, don't grow up on me now, pete. His count's borderline. You boost people all the time. You know it could help. And if his numbers are normal... Come on. Let's let the kid get the girl. Violet. (sighs) I am unimaginably sorry About what happened to you, violet. And I'm sorry you and pete aren't working out, But... You gave away a child that wasn't yours to give. I mean, I-it could be, but--but we don't know. And I need to know. I need to know, violet, if he's my son. I want you to agree to a paternity test. Okay. What? Fine. Whatever. Do it. So what do we think, Corsage or no corsage? (cooper and pete) no corsage. I kinda like the idea of pinning it on. You know... Yeah, we know... (chuckles) romeo. And I'm done. I'm gonna be good? Well, we'll see. Your c-d-4 has to be above 200. So what do you think, kiss her while we're dancing Or wait and take her outside after? What? Look, I... I want him to be happy. He's kept such a good attitude. I thought it would be easier this time Because I'd been through it. That was stupid. The idea of losing your child doesn't get easier. You have kids? Yes. Then you know. Yes.              That feeling. She's getting worse. We've contacted every donor list. Hopefully we'll find another match. And when they don't? Let's cross that bridge... (sighs) (woman speaking indistinctly over p.A.)</i> Are you okay? I've spent the past 12 hours Thinking about death. Sarah dying tomorrow, Emily's h.I.V. Turning into a.I.D.S. And her dying And leaving her three babies with no one, Someone dying so I can have a kidney. I've been sitting in the e.R. Just hoping some 24 year old on a motorcycle with no helmet Bites it on the freeway And by some miracle is a match. I'm sick of thinking about death. (knocks on doorjamb) I want a paternity test. Have you talked to violet? I have her consent, yeah. Okay, what about pete? What about me what? I want addison to perform a paternity test on lucas. No. How soon can you do this? I said no. Uh, guys, guys, let's just take a deep breath. If I take any more breaths, I'm gonna hyperventilate. Just do the test. Addison, you can't do this. You don't have-- Then I'll get someone else. I want to know. Well, I know. I look at him and I already know. You want me to diagnose that, pete? It's denial. You asked me to take care of them. (addison) okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's what I've been doing. When she was with you. I didn't say you could raise my child. He's not your child! I will get a lawyer if I have to. I have the mother's consent. (pete) don't do it. All right, guys, guys. It doesn't have to-- do the test. Sheldon, please. We don't have to go this far. (exhales deeply) I hate this day. I'm sorry about your patient. I figured I'd pour you a glass more than half-full.</i> When did you become an optimist? I'm not. I just saw that you were brooding. Oh. Not brooding. Just checking out the local scenery. Am not. I do not check out scenery. I think it's great. You're single. He's single. I mean, you know, there were sparks. Just tell me something. Just tell me how come all anybody thinks about is sex? Why is that all you doctors do, Sleep with each other? I did not sleep with noah. (scoffs) okay, look, maybe I thought about sleeping with him, But I didn't do it. I did the right thing this time. I did not sleep with him. I tried to fire her as a patient. I stopped things with noah before they went too far. For the record, in case you're wondering. I wasn't. Okay, you know, you think you're doing me a favor By not saying anything, but it's written all over your face. So you might as well just say it before your head explodes. Husband's best friend, patient's husband-- Where I come from, that's called a bad t record. Me poor woman's marching around your office building With a baby trying to figure out What the hell happened to her marriage, And you want a gold star 'cause you did the right thing. You acting like a tramp, you don't get a gold star. You asked. Are you okay? I'm glass half-empty, and we're not talking about it. Okay. (sighs) * is it the thunder * * that brings fear? * * is it the sparrow * * that brings music... * Leave me out of this, please. The birth certificate has no father's name. This is a change form. I put my name down as father. I need you to sign it. You have to work this out with sheldon. Sign the paper, violet. You owe me that much. You owe lucas that much. I'm his father J-just sign it. You need to work this out with sheldon. * his love... * I'm sorry. * that made it begin * * for the first time * * and his love... * Mm. * set it right * * to keep us going on * * but we keep... * Where you going? Home. Why? 'cause that's where I live. Come on. I thought we could talk. About what? About, uh... I don't know. Just talk. This is every man's dream-- Me, no strings, no talk, just sex. You are a lucky, lucky man. Hey, hey. I want you, charlotte. Not just in my bed, I want to be your boyfriend again. I know you got hurt. You called me-- It was a moment, cooper, a moment. And then violet got attacked, and the moment passed. Right now I'm dealing with this my way. Just go with it. * ...From his side * Addison. (clears throat) I'm embarrassed. I shouldn't have barged in here yesterday. That's just not something I would normally do. I-I would call first. And bringing the baby with me like that wasn't right. Lately, uh, nothing I do makes much sense. You don't... Have to apologize. You had every right to ask the question. I just hope that you believe me. I do. I think I do. Good. Good. Because whatever happened... You know, I just never wanted to make things harder. I don't want to be that person, you know? I mean, I hope you know that... Because we didn't-- I just hope it helps, you know? I hope you and noah... Get--put this behind you. I hope so. This is cruel. Tell me. Ladies and gentlemen... 204. Yes! Now you're right on the border, but you can kiss the girl. Mom, mom, I'm going. I gotta call kelli. Are you okay? I'm fine. I... Ryan. What? Wait. What? Your mom has a fever. You're burning up. You could have the flu. (wom) I'm sorry, ry. I'm so sorry. I thought it was a headache. No! His numbers are there. His system's compromised. I'm fine. I feel fine. Ryan, there'll be other dances. I asked you for a consult, Not to make decisions without consulting me. You're trying so hard to be his friend, You've lost sight of what's best for him. Having a life is what's best for him, And seeing that girl is what's best for him. And what's best for his mother, Risking her son's life so he can get kissed? That's her kid, cooper. Can you imagine what she goes through? Look, pete, I know you're a dad now And it's a big, bad world out there, But you want to tell me what's going on here? Sheldon wants a paternity test. Violet said yes. Her "t" waves are peaked. Potassium's togh. Her organs are shutting down. Okay, uh, let's increase her morphine. (monitor beeping rhythmically) No. Bailey, look at me. You can't. Sh-she's dying. There isn't another kidney to transplant. Okay, just no more waiting. Just... They both know the risks. You think charlotte king is gonna let you do An illegal surgery? I've dealt with tougher chiefs than charlotte king. What, so that's it? You--you feel guilty, So you're just gonna forget what everybody else has to say, Forget about the law, forget-- I don't have time for this. Yeah, walk away, bailey. Just walk away. You--you know what? No, you're--you're right. When I first got here, I was guilty about what happened. But I was acting as a doctor, A surgeon, 'cause that's my job... Oh. To cut through the bull and save the patient. Please don't pull the surgeon card. We're all doctors around here. It's a personality thing. Okay, yeah. I-I've seen you long enough to see that you're good, But you hang back, you watch, you decide. I act. I don't stand outside a room watching my life pass me by, And I won't stand by and watch this patient die. This isn't about lawsuits Or red tape or hospital bureaucracy. This is about a girl who came to us for help, And we couldn't give it. And now we're telling she to just die quietly. Seattle grace is on the hook here If this girl dies. The law is antiquated here, and you know it. The question is, are you a by-the-book chief Or a do-what's-right chief? This usually works for you, This kind of blatant manipulation? Usually. Yeah, me, too. This is the right thing to do, the human thing. I'll talk to some staff, see if I can get a team together. What the hell, right? What are they gonna do, drag us off to jail for saving lives? They might. Addison was wrong about you. (door opens) What are you doing? You just gonna let sheldon Go ahead and have a paternity test? Yes. You gave the baby to pete. You can't just-- I can. I did. It's done. No, we have to talk about this. We're gonna talk about this. Don't, don't, don't, don't touch me. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I cannot let you just toss your child to the wind. Okay, well, what do you want from me? I want you to care, violet. This is your child. Don't you think I want to care? Don't you think I would give anything to care, To have a feeling, to be happy, sad, angry, anything? I... I can't feel anything, cooper. Do you know what that's like? It's like not being able to taste. It's like remembering what food is like. Like you can smell chocolate, but you can't taste it. You can't get the sensation when it's on your tongue. I want to care. I want to be a person who cares about her son. But my insides are dead. I am rotting from the inside out. And I wish there was some pill, There was something to fix this, But there isn't. All I have is my work. So please... Please... Just let me do my work. Just... (joey ryan) * maybe we'll come outta this * * unscathed * (lucas crying) * just like the story said * * ever after we shall be okay * (crying stops) * okay * * yes, and I know * Hey. I heard, uh, the baby crying. Sorry. I... Addison. Yeah. Are you okay? What's going on with you? Nothing. I'm fine, nai. No, you're not. (sighs) * ...Make it alone * Look, I went downstairs because I needed to. It was something I had to do. I did it for me, not to hurt you. I want to get past this. It's not about that. Then what? I have been asking. I have been trying. I can't. I... I just can't. * (breathing heavily) (blows air) * look at your reflection * * casting your own image in the stream * (exhales) Morgan. All the way home, I kept trying to figure out Why I don't feel better. Did you, uh, you want to go into my office? Oh, where you feel more comfortable?</i> No, I don't. I kn what you said, and... Y-you'd think That knowing your husband had stayed faithful Would--would be a relief, But I feel worse. I feel worse because if it was sex, He could get over sex. Sex is biological. Sex is carnal. Sex is... Forgivable. But I see what this did to him, And I see the look in your eyes, And I keep thinking, if it wasn't sex... Did you... Do you love him? * ...Make it alone * Damn it. But we didn't-- Have sex? What does it matter if he thinks about you? He thinks about you. No matter what he says, no matter what he does... (voice breaking) for the rest of our marriage, You're gonna be there in my head. I'm gonna be wondering if he's thinking about you. (normal voice) you said nothing happened. It's a lie, and you know it. I know dr. King asked for your help, But I just want to reiterate, There could be negative ramifications If you assist in this operation. So if any one of you want to back out, Now would be the time. I'm sorry. I won't tell anyone, but I can't do this. We'll do it without him. I can only back you so far. Without a proper team, it's a no go. Uh, she has a full team. I did a surgical residency. I didn't always stand by and watch. Okay, we're losing time. Let's scrub in. I'm turning into that guy That calls the cops on a party. No. You're turning into a father-- A good father, you know? I mean, you're probably right about ryan. I just-- He's a good kid, and I like him, And I want to see him and, uh... Oh, my god. I think I'm actually jealous of this kid And his relationship with his girlfriend. It's pathetic. That is pathetic. (cell phone rings and beeps) Hi, betty. No, no, no, no. You stay where you are. We'll go. Yeah, I'll call you. Ryan's gone, and so is his suit. (daryl hall & john oates) * what I want, you've got *</i> * and it might be hard to handle *</i> * but like the flame that burns the candle *</i> * the candle feeds the flame * * yeah, yeah, what I've got's * * full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter *</i> Well, high school dances haven't changed. They still smell like desperation and puke. * well, well, you * * ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *</i> * you make my dreams come true *</i> * ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh * * ooh, ooh * Ryan. Hey. Sorry, man. We gotta go. Wait. Not yet. Come on. You're burning up. I just got here. You're embarrassing me. We're sorry, but you know you gotta go. Come on. * on a night when bad dreams become a screamer *</i> (sighs) kelli, I'm sorry. You stay and have fun. I'm sorry. It's... It's okay. I'll come visit you later. * and wrap yourself around me * * 'cause I ain't the way... * I didn't even get to kiss her. There'll be another time. (voice echoing) another time.</i> Another time. Another time.</i> * ooh, ooh * * you make my dreams come true *</i> * ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh * * yeah * * ooh *</i> * well, well, well, you * * ooh *</i> * ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh * * you make my dreams come true *</i> Now we can go. * oh, yeah * * ooh *</i> Ryan. He's pale and diaphoretic. Sinus tach at 114. Neuro's intact. His glucose is 88. Let's get him a c.B.C., chem-pan and culture him up. Okay, bolus a liter of saline and get a cooling blanket. Come on. Pulse ox is 88. Get him on a high-flow mask. Ryan. Ryan, come on. Stay with us, ryan. Hey! It's okay. Best night of my life. Pressure's dropping. Let's set him up for a central line. We gotta get him into an iso room. On my count. One, two, three. We're gonna put you under now. Take good care of her, okay? How about you tell us About those beautiful babies of yours, And we'll take care of the rest? Um... Uh, lily-- she's the oldest. She's got the biggest eyes you've ever... Okay, everybody. Let's do this. You're still here. Yeah. Waiting to hear from bailey. I think she's gonna need a ride back from the hospital. Oh. You look like I feel. Oh, it's been that kind of day. (lucas cries) Ooh, ooh, ooh. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Okay. (crying stops) Must be nice t a baby. Haven't made any mistakes, Had any fights... (sighs) Said anything you can't take back. No, everything's ahead for you... Best friends, hmm? First love. First kiss. (chuckles) Mm. Right now... All I want to do Is take my son, drive down to mexico And get away from all this. It's tough to do the right thing. It's tough to do the right thing. (footsteps approach) (lock clicks) What's wrong? Is everything okay? I couldn't sleep. I-I couldn't... Be alone. I had to get out of that house. Look, you may not get it, 'cause, um, Well, you're a mother and, um... You love your kid. And you're--you're good, So you may not get it. But, um, you know, you know me, And you haven't tried to... I need a friend. I just--I need a friend who will let me sit And maybe drink and not talk about anything. Do you get that? I do. I get it. More suction. I need to see what I'm doing. All right, retract the rectus muscle. I'm placing the kidney. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Okay. (monitor beeping erratically) All right, her blood pressure's opping. 90 over 60. She's throwing p.V.C.S? What the hell? All right. Her neck veins are distended. It's pericardial tamponade. You need a pericardial window to drain the fluid From around her heart. All right, someone page a cardiothoracic surgeon. No, there's no time. Betadine. Give me a 15 blade and a metz. What--what are you doing? We need a surgeon. I've done this before. I can do this. 15 blade. Are you out of your mind? Give me the scalpel! 2-inch vertical incision... Subxiphoid. Okay. Peel the peritoneum... Off the diaphragm. Okay. 11 blade. (beeping continues) Extend the incision. Pressure? 70 over 50 and dropping. (beeping continues) Damn it. Well, keep doing what you're doing. Okay. Okay, I can feel the heart. Got it.

(monitor beeping rhythmically) What the hell just happened in there? I did a surgical residency in cardiothoracic. Well, haven't you ever-- I don't talk about why. Why is nobody's business. You are an infuriating... Tiny... Little woman. Excuse me. I'm gonna kiss you. Okay. (gasps) I--I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You think you have everything all figured out. But you don't know anything, do you? (chuckles) Uh... (sighs) So these two psychiatrists meet At their 20th college reunion, right? Uh... (chuckles) When I'm anxious, sometimes I, uh...

Cooper, what are you doing? * ...Through the rain and the fire * * 'cause it taught me how to love * * it taught me how to fight * Wh--are you crazy? Put me down. You're screwed up, charlotte. I can't talk to you, And you can't talk to me, and when I stand back And ask myself what we're doing, I don't know. I just know you're worth it, and I am the man. I am the man here. So I don't care if you can talk to me. And I don't care if you tell me about getting fired or whatever. I am taking my woman home to our bed. You're moving in with me.

He... Talked to this woman about us, About life, about what he wanted, Which, in the end, wasn't me. Now they never slept together, But he cheated on me The minute he sent the first e-mail... * ...To get somewhere * (voice breaking) shared feelings With this other woman... Intimate feelings... That he did not share with me. I fell in love with him. * and I earned these wings * And I keep saying that... I did the right thing in the end. But along the way... I did wrong. (normal voice) you did wrong. But, you know, at least you're open, At least you try, you feel, You... Are alive, you have feelings. (scoffs) I don't even know how to be kissed anymore. I'm sorry. I'm not the one you need to be apologizing to. Mm. * when you lose your way * * when you can't escape * * when you feel... * Hey. * of all the world says you will never be * You've done nothing wrong. You just... You're you. I mean, you've done nothing wrong. I'm the one. I feel guilty, and I look at you. I see myself through your eyes, And... It's like you're judging me. I am not judging you. I know. I'm judging me... For who I am, for what I've done, And... It's just easier to take it out on you Than to take it out on me. * ...And the fire * * 'cause it taught me how to love * I'm sorry. * and finally I'm learning to fly * You want to sit down?
