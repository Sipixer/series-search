Epic, epic war I know but the good news is that we won. Archer is nearly himself again. Nearly? What? something wrong? God no! No... Everything is fine. All parts are working. - Okay, my brother my brother.... - Sorry. It's just that it's... It's good. Really good. - Yeah? - I... I think he's my boyfriend. He sleeps over every night and he calls constantly. He's been talking lately Addison. I think I have a man. Archer is comitting. I'm getting another bottle of wine Yes please. Archer! What do you... Is this your wife? Are you married? But... He has a girlfriend. Who is here. Damn it! I'm sure you're a very nice person, but maybe a little bit old to get filled up on the doorway but now it's all the best. Good bye. You... You've got to get the lipstick off of your face This is pre or post sex? I hope you used a condomn you **** I'm in trouble right? Hey Dell, can I call... Yeah, is she... she okay? Great, I'll be right there, thanks bye Addison, anything to eat? Hi, I'm edible. What are you doing here? Hi Okay you two, you just do whatever... the two of you do. I gotta go Come on... Bare down. One more big push. It's a fast labor, I'm sorry I thought I could be doing it solo. You're doing great. Come on Lea you're almost there. - I can see his head. - All right, the baby is coming. Come on Lea! Come on! Got it. Matthew. He's here. I want to hold him. I want my little boy. What's wrong? - It's not a boy. - What... ultrasound was wrong? It's a girl? I'm not sure. Private Practice S02E17 Wait and See<i> I know this is impossibly hard and we don't have all the answers yet, but your baby have something like a penis, There's also a vaginal opening The baby's heart and lungs and brain are very healthy and that's important for you to understand But what is it? We'll run some genetic and hormonal tests I consult with my collegue Dr Bennet she's an excellent endocrinologist. - We're gonna get you answers. - Well, until then... what do we tell people? What are we... What are we call him? He's Mathew... He's... He's supposed to be... he's supposed to be Mathew. Why did you go to Seattle? I'm sorry. It's just... it's running through my mind on a loop like a song I can't stop humming, so I have to ask. Seattle. - Why did you go? - Archer's surgery. Look, Naomi likes to pretend like she has it all together, Well she's an Ivy league educated doctor with... the best shoe collection I've ever seen - so she does have it all together - Usually, but... Archer getting sick, In fact, she need a shoulder to lean on. Is it? I think it's great. You've managed the impossible You've maintain a good relationship with your ex. It's just why I like you. I like you too. - You're not a good guy. - Yes, I am. I was wondering, I run a couple's therapy group and my co-leader's down with a stomach bug and I think it's very important that we have a male and, a female therapist You know... Role modeling Communication modeling and... I wondered if you'd like to fill in. I know, not such a great idea considering No, no, I... I think it's good. I like working with couples. Are you sure? - What time? - Our conference room, at one - Lunch time - Okay, see you then How is it? the baby? - It's fine. - Good. That's good that it's fine because... I would really apreciate if we didn't talk about this right now, because I don't know if I can handle it. I'll see you later Oh, you've got that look that "it's impossible to decide for Violet" look. Look, I've just given up. I'm going cool. Not cold, just cool The hell of it with cold. Therapy should be interesting. You and Violet are in therapy? No we're doing therapy, together, it's a... - couple's group. - You're leading it? - As a couple? - Yes, we are. Good luck with that. You should have seen the look on their faces, it was awfull. like this is their fault Are you okay? No, what... What do we tell them? Well, I... wish I had a good answer, but the baby does have 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency - What is it? - It is an enzime deficiency that causes an over production of testosterone in the baby in-utero That's why the baby has both male and female sex organ. - The caryotype is XX - So the baby is a girl? No, it's not that simple. Yes, genetically, it is a girl, but... 30% of these cases, these kids orient towards male. So we can't tell the parents what sex the baby is? Well, they have to choose and then we can surgically correct the genitalia. You just said there is a 30% margin for error Post-op, the healing is faster and it leaves the genitelia functional. All, suported with hormon therapy. But what if they choose wrong and the baby oriented the other way? Exactly, we shouldn't have them choose the gender now, but not do surgery. Let them raise the baby as a boy or a girl and then when the baby becomes an adolescent, he'll make up - its own mind. - That's the problem. Living in an it. everyry sleep over, every swim party or lockroom is gonna be a cause for panic Maybe it should be, whatever it is and not what everybody wants it to be. While I was out, I've been missing all the fun. Half and half body parts. - Inter-sex baby. - Kinda like worms. Some people think gender is hardwired. So what do we do? It's not gonna change the outcome. Me, I found that freakish but I'm a boy. - How was your first day back? - It's perfect now Good morning dr King Move in with me Cooper. I know you care about Violet and the baby, and I understand why you wanted to move in with her. But you can still be there for both of them, without living at her place. Violet is afraid to be alone. -So I need to be there for her. - I'm your girlfriend. And I'm here for you and living with Violet... doesn't change that. My patience only gets so far. He's a boy, but... it could also be a girl. My god. What are we supposed to do? How do we decide? Well, the odds say that your baby will most likely identify as a female so we can do corrective surgery and give the baby the appropriate genitalia. You want to take my baby, my son, and cut off of his penis. Alternately you can choose the gender now raise the baby and then when he or she matures you reevaluate. And hide this for his entire childhood? What do we tell him? How do we even begin to explain this to a little kid? But that... not everybody the same, that is okay to be different It's not okay. kids are cruel one kid sees him in the bathroom everyone's talking and tease him and that... that's what kids do. - that's not the life we want - we need to make this right We need to put this behind us behind him or her and make it right. What's the best way? I like women. I like a lot of women. but I am not married to Naomi, and she is not the mother of my children. Naomi sat by your side while you had surgery, she held your hand. You, upstairs, sticking your tongue down her throat, seeing her every day, letting her believe that you two have something together... - I thought I was dying. - You are... you are asking me to lie for you. you are making me feel dirty and cheap, and I'm 10 years old again telling Mother that I went out for ice cream with daddy when really I'm sitting in his office while he's screwing his secretary down the hall. I'm too much of a snob to screw sretaries. You think this is funny?! I think that you're one to talk. I seem to remember something about you doing your husband's best friend behind his back. That was once. I slipped once. So you're like... you're like an alcoholic? You're on a program... "God grant me the serenity" and all that crap? You are so mean when you know that I am right. You know what? I am mean when I want you to mind your own business. - I won't keep your secrets for... - Yes, you will. Montgomerys look the other way when it is none of their business. Now there's a sight for sore eyes. I got patients lined up for weeks waiting for you to get back. - Well, that's me... money in the bank. - I like money in the bank. What? I like your brother. He's my golden boy. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I just... - I had to see you again. - This is the fourth time this week. Well, I checked your schedule. I know you have an opening. Come on, Pete. Just a quickie. I feel like Paul doesn't share much of himself with me either. - He hardly wants to have sex anymore. - I get home from work, I'm tired, and you don't seem that interested. but when I ask you what's going on, you won't talk to me. I want to know what's going on with you up here. See, there's your first mistake, thinking much of anything goes on for us guys up here. You know what I think, Greg? I think we guys like women to think that. maybe we think it ourselves, but part of that is that we don't look at ourselves, don't ask ourselves what we're thinking or feeling. Exactly. I mean, the truth is, all of us have things going on inside. I mean, right now, everyone in this room, Sheldon and me included, have a thousand things going on. And the trick is to open yourself to that and to share it. That's... not to say, of course, that there aren't pieces you want to keep to yourself. You don't want to lose yourself in a relationship. But the beauty of good communication is that when you share... share what you're thinking, good or bad... you both feel better, maybe help each other. Ryan and I used to have that. Back in high school when we met, we talked about everything. And now all you want to talk about are the kids. That's not true. But I'm there with them all day. You don't want to know about that? That's my world. I know it's hard, here, in the group, but talking... it really will make things better. I love seeing you, - but this has gotta stop. - I can't stay away. Whatever you do, whenever you put your hands on me, I swear, it's... - magic. - It's not magic, - and it's not... - I've been reading up a lot on reiki therapy, healing hands. It's supposed to be incredible. - Let's try it. - I'm not a specialist at reiki. - I can't do that. - You can do whatever you want to me. As a doctor, - I can't keep pretending this is okay. - Come on. Just one more time. It's been taken care of. If you could just file it, that would be great. You know what? We haven't been speaking for two weeks. I... miss you. Don't treat me like the pervert next door. If you lived next door, we wouldn't be having the problem. I want to get past this. We need to get past this.What's it gonna take - for you to forgive me? - I don't know, I'm working on it. We walked past your wall of pictures... all those kids... happy and sweet and... normal. and that's what... - our baby should be. - And surgery can do that. Surgery can give your baby gender-distinct genitalia, yes. And we can know? We can stop saying... "it"? Great. So let... let's do that. Can we do it soon? I can book an O.R. for tomorrow. Afterward, we'll supplement with estrogen she'll be as healthy as possible. No... that's not what we want. It was clear to us from the second we saw his face... he's... - He's Matthew. - But... only 30% of these babies orient toward male. You said you don't know. We know. He's our son. You're gonna give us our son. I just saw Ryan and Eleanor in the stairwell. - You mean Ryan and Sasha? - No, I mean Ryan and Eleanor. They were communicating, lip-to-lip. - Did they see you? - No, they were too focused. I can't believe this. Maybe it's a cry for help. An affair in a stairwell after marriage counseling is a cry for help? They haven't been able to communicate in their own relationships, so they do this awful thing where they could get caught because they want - to force the communication. - Only we can't tell on them. It's not like they disclosed this in session. - I don't think the waivers apply. - I'm not suggesting outing them. - I'm just saying we get them to tell. - How is exposing an affair - going to improve communication? - So we let the secret keepestering till it poisons every aspect of the group? It'll become the 800-pound gorilla in the room. As therapists, we need to acknowledge that gorilla - and take steps to deal with it. - We don't know what they feel about this. We don't know what they think about it. They could be in love. This could be - a onetime thing. - Which is why we need to talk to them. What I think... as bad as this is, getting them to confess could be the break through the group needs. I was surprised that you changed your mind about doing the surgery. Well, I can help them. You know, the Thompsons, they are desperate to change their situation, for them and for the baby. And... you made a very good case that surgery is the only way to really do that. I did, but... a boy? - The odds are stacked against that. - Gender's not my choice. It's theirs. And they want him past this. They want him better, and I can help. Speaking of better... I was thinking of borrowing Archer for a few days. A weekend in Palm Springs. You know, sleeping late, getting massages... What? - Do... you think that's a good idea? - A trip with me? No... I mean, just, you know... healthwise. He... he can go back to work, but... going to a spa is strenuous? But I mean, you know Archer. I mean, he's... gonna want to play golf, tennis. He'll... push himself. - You don't want me to go. - No! I do... it's just... Why rush it? Because I want to go away with my boyfriend, like a woman, like a woman with a lover. Lover? Lover. I like that. That's a lot better than boyfriend. He's my lover. What do you think? Lover. Yeah, it sounds stupid. It sounds like a soap opera. - It's not... - What about paramour? Arch, come on. We're gonna be late. You really need to learn how to knock. - I'm sorry. - No. That's... - that's just what I get. - You okay? - Don't touch me. - 'Cause my sister walked in? We just... we never should've... I never should've done it. Where are... Archer and Addison? Addison's waiting for him at the office. It's his first day back. He's got a lot of work to catch up on, so... Charlotte's probably holding his feet to the fire. Where's Archer? He... he got stuck at the office. I don't think he's gonna make it. Aren't we here celebrating his first day back? Well, maybe I should call him. He was with a patient when I left. I'm gonna get a drink. - What can I give you? - Scotch, neat. What... - How come you're not with them? - I decided I like the quiet. - Me too. - Here you go I thought you'd be in a great mood. Archer's back at work, things are back to normal. You'd think. What? Can I tell you something... and you can't tell... you can't tell anyone? Anything. Never mind. Forget it. Don't do that. Don't... don't shut yourself off from me. - You don't need to see my crazy. - You don't think I have crazy? Do you feel left out? I feel... broken. Archer is cheating on Naomi... which is wrong on so many levels, but mostly because he's gonna hurt her. He will, and there's nothing... I just... I can't... It's okay. You're okay. What do I do? People make their own choices. You can't do it for them. - But it's not... I don't think it's... - Sorry I'm late. You're here. - You want to talk about this? - Will it help? Then what's the point? Don't... don't be this guy. Don't be this limited, short-sighted, not-good-enough guy, - please. - Look, I like Naomi. I really do. It's just... I'm sorry. Don't apologize to me. Why don't you apologize to her? You know, I hated him. I hated dad for years. Past tense. Hated. What, do you love him now? Now he's your hero? I am him, Addison. I am him! Like father like son. Whatever he passed down to me, I'm missing a gene. You don't think I want to be better? you don't think I want to be a good man - in a storm? I don't have it in me. - That's a cop-out. Maybe it is, but it's honest. Do you usually do this, have us come in alone? Sheldon's never done this before. Well, sometimes I find things that are best served outside the group. What's going on? I saw you in the stairwell yesterday. - Oh, god. - It just happened. After the first session, Ryan and I, we started talking, and... it was easy. Everything you said about communication that we couldn't do with our spouses, the two of us could. Are you gonna tell? You can't do that. Can you? You might think that keeping this a secret is a good thing and that holding it in is better, but I think it would be best for both of you to go home, talk to your spouses and work together to try to figure this out. You came to the group to work on your marriages, to make things better. Is that still what you want, to work on your marriages? We want to be together. and if telling our spouses is the first step to a new life together... We'll do it. Instead of wanting to save their marriage, they're just - willing to walk away. - Maybe it's a good thing. I mean, if it's not working, why force it? I don't know what's worse... to be faithful in a loveless marriage or to - cheat to find true love. - What are we talking about? Keeping secrets. That's tough, keeping people's secrets. That's why it's better not to. I mean, if... if you care about that person, you just tell 'em, - bottom line. - Especially in a marriage. The bond between a husband and wife is sacrosanct. Like the bond between a parent and a child. - How is the Thompson baby? - I'm operating today. The parents want a boy, and I think it's important to respect that. What about what that kid wants? He's a little young to make that decision. I hope you make the right one. Are you hungry? Frustrated. Charlotte acts like I'm cheating on her. I mean, here I am trying to be the good guy... all I get is guilt. I'm... I'm really not the person you should talk to about this, Cooper. Talk to her. We need to talk. stop treating me like I've done something horrible, like taking care of my friend is cheating on you. - You don't know... - You don't know. All I've ever wanted to do is make you happy. I can't do that if you're shutting me out. Please. You ready to do this? I'm sorry we left so early last night. It's... I just... I think Archer's just so glad to be healthy again, that we... I'm sorry. No, never mind. I know... some details I just have to keep to myself. I asked him about going away, and... we're thinking maybe next weekend. and I came up with a name for him. "Beau." He's my beau. You know, it's simple and it's a little old-fashioned, but still, I think it's better than "boyfriend." I can't do this. Is something wrong? You said it was gonna be hours. I can't do this. - I'm sorry. I can't do the surgery. - Is the baby sick? - The baby is fine. - That's just it. The baby is fine. But you, Naomi, we all want to change the baby into a him, into something that he's not. So you... you just want to leave him a freak? - He... he's not a freak. - He is if they don't do the surgery. Please, you gotta do this. Give us our son. I can't. I can't do it. I won't. If you want a boy, you can still have a boy. You can take him home and... and call him Matthew and love him and accept him for what he is and raise him so that, when the time comes, he'll make the choice that's... that's right for him. and mean while, what, our... our kid should hide? Be - embarrassed, humiliated, what? - We could protect him. What do you think it'll be like to be a 6-year-old boy with a vagina? Imagine being a 20-year-old woman without one. We'll... we'll find another surgeon, someone who will do this. She's right. We need to think about this. It is too important to just - hurt him this way. - Him. That's right, him. That in there, our baby, it's a him. and leaving him like this, it's not right. - I don't want to make a mistake. - Well, I can't... I can't do this. All right? I can't do this. I can't... take that home and hope it turns out right. I can't... I can't change that diaper every day and... I can't do this. I can't. I can't. Did yesterday's session... bring up anything? Ryan came to me. He... said he wanted to talk. I was surprised. It had been so long. And he had this look on his face. And he started to tell me all the things that were wrong and how he was feeling, and I guess... It's not all him. It's me. It's us. We talked for hours, and then.. We had sex. - Sasha, come on. - We did. We can talk about it. For the first time in a long time, we had sex, and it was great. Something about it felt new and better and different. I guess because I felt like he was there. I know that this might be... uncomfortable, but it might be helpful if you could tell us how you feel. Well, it wasn't what I thought I'd be saying. But we talked, and I remembered what we had and what we can still have. I had an affair. What the hell just happened back there? I don't understand what just happened. You agreed to do the surgery and... - This isn't about the surgery. - Well, what is it? I thought... that he could be a different person. After everything he went through, after almost dying, I thought... he could be a different person. I wanted to believe that so much that I almost cut into a baby to convince myself that people can change, that I can change them. but I can't. Archer's cheating on you. And I'm sorry. Who was it?! Someone I know?! Tthis may be hard to hear, Paul, but sometimes an affair isn't moving away, it's reaching out... - For the wrong thing. - It's reaching out towards someone who seems like an answer. But they're not. They're a crutch, a way to fill the void of something that's missing, the person that you really love. The person I really love? I thought I had lost that with Sasha. I was in the same boat you are. Maybe we all are in the same boat. But isn't it... isn't it worth another chance? .I think I made a mistake - I don't care. - But you should, because if you want anything to change, you have to work at it. You... haven't shared yourself, and I... I understand that. how can you share yourself if you don't know what you think or you don'tnow what you feel, and it makes you feel pathetic and crazy and bad? And you think that if you share that, then they might decide that... you're as crazy as you feel you are. But we're...all of us... we're... we're human. We make mistakes. I have, I know Eleanor has, and I bet you have, too. But if you can talk to her about this, if you can open up with her, Then I... really think you can work through this and make things better. You know what? I'm done. I'm afraid that Carol will leave me, just like Paul did. When you come home at night and you talk about how great the guys are you work with, I feel small... insignificant. I know who I am and what I am... but it scares me that you'll realize you could do better. You should've talked to me. Because I want you. I love you. This has got to stop. When I'm with you, what you do to me... These days, it's the best day I ever feel. Look... I want to try this new herb... red clover. It's supposed to put years on your life and take years off your face. - I know what you're gonna say. - You have cancer. I know that. Stage II lymphoma. I know that. God, I know that. You don't have to say it. I do. I love that you come to see me. You're one of my favorite patients. But I've referred you to the best oncologist in town, and you won't go. You have to go. I tried. I made it to the waiting room. But those people are so frail. I mean, they're bald or worse... bad wigs and chapped skin. I c... - I can't be like that. - They're sick like you are, but they're getting the right treatment, they are trying to get better. What if they don't? Then they don't, but their eyes are wide open. They know they can't cheat fate. They're fighting, the way you should be fighting. I don't want to be the one... who dies. Then be the one who lives. He's gone. I'm sorry. I'm going home, to New York. Are you saying good bye to Naomie. Don't tell her about Charlotte. that would hurt her Archer you're living without a word, that would hurt her - Don't do this. - Bye Addie. I love you. I want to see how you're doing. Mitch is gone... I don't know how I'm gonna do this alone * *** with blue Matthew Mitch was so excited. You know... I know, You want to... save him from... all ****** go througt, but... I think you're doing the right thing. I hope so. You do not get to just cut and run just because you're afraid of not knowing what comes next. There are people that love you and that need you. Why are you here yelling at me? because its not okay to just walk away and pretend like it doesn't matter. to have something incredible and not even see what is right in front of your face... your wife loves you, and you have a healthy child, who, yeah, has some issues, but so what? Everybody has issues. You need to be there for them, - love them. - Well, I don't know if I can. Grow up. Be a man. You need to... not hurt the woman who loves you. Well. nice surprise. I slept with Archer Montgomery. I just... thought you should know. You don't get to just walk away from me after telling me that. How dare you? How dare you do this? - It's just the way I am. - That's crap! You did the one thing you could to push me away, to make me make the choice and not you. guess what. That's not gonna work. I'm not going anywhere. You want to sleep with some guy to hurt me, to make me back off? Too bad. I'm here. I'm storming the freakin' castle for you, and you so underestimated me. What, you thought I was so weak that I'm gonna walk away because my pride got wounded? You are mine. and I'm not walking away because you're scared. God. I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. This one... I can overlook. This one. But you have to think long and hard about testing me, because next time, I'm gone. You better dig deep, dig deep in your soul and grow the hell up and be in this relationship Right now. I wanted to thank you for what you said today. - I don't think I got through to Paul. - you got through to Greg and Carol, and we saved a marriage, maybe two. Trying to figure this stuff out is hard. I mean, they come to us, they're on the brink already. If we turn two out of three... I say we won. It was a shock. I mean the pregnancy. It was... it was... unplanned, and I don't often do unplanned. So this whole thing is unfamiliar territory for me. And I'm just trying to... roll with - it the best way I can. - I know, Violet. And I don't expect you to confide in me. But if you do need me, I'm here for you. You taste good. Really good. What's wrong? What did you just call me? What? You just called me Naomi. No, I didn't. - No, I didn't. - You did. You warned me. I thought... I really thought Archer had changed... or that he could. I'm sorry. I know he's your brother, and... I know I shouldn't. - It's not right to say it, but... - Say it. I hate him. Me, too.
