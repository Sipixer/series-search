Let's see- 27 weeks pregnant, Ultrasound from two days ago Looks good, Oh, it's a girl, And... Placenta positioning Looks good. So what's the concern? I- i need to have this baby. Well, everything's on track. No, that- That's not what-eric. We need to have this baby Now. Today if possible. I'm-i'm sorry. I'm not understanding. You're only Six months pregnant. Well, you have to induce Or do a c-section so that i can Have this baby today.</i> It has to be born. Please just- He'll die if you don't. He-he is dying, damn it. I'm sorry, who is dying? Our son jason. He's 7. He has Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The baby's cord blood's the only Thing that can save him. -==http://www.ragbear.com==- Ë½èëõïëù µú¶þ¼¾µú1¼¯</font> You're avoiding me. I am not avoiding you. I've just been busy- Running the practice And raising our daughter. Always keeping the trains Running on time. Trains or no trains, We will talk. Hey, do you have a minute? No, act- No, she does not. What? Molly and eric madison. You selected the embryo that Matched their dying son... And implanted it. Selective i.v.f. You chose a genetic match For their dying son And impregnated her? Yes. I-i do not understand What the problem is here? The problem is that She's carrying a child, Except to her it's not a child, It's an organ donor. To her, she's growing organs For her sick son. Not organs. The umbilical cord blood Is going to be collected At birth, processed, And then infused into her son to save his Life. Same thing, nal. Morally, ethically- It's a gray area to grow A child's genetic match. This is done all the time As a backup. But he is dying now, And she wants her daughter Delivered Three months premature With no regard For the baby's health. Oh, god. I didn't... They-they had A partial match donor. The partial match Has pneumonia. Addison... That means... Their son has had His immune system stripped In preparation for the donor. He's in the hospital right now, And if he doesn't receive That cord blood Within the week, he dies. Well, what did you tell 'em about Delivering the baby? I said no. Why? Thank you for the update, Dr. King. You're welcome, Dr. Freedman. Hey. I was just coming- So on mnemba island, There's no phones, There's no computer, There's no television. Our bonus checks will be put To very good use. Um, i don't know. Maybe. We can touch monkeys, cooper. We can touch monkeys. Yeah, okay. You made that Last part up. I have patients. Well, i have patients, too, And as i am seeing them, Part of me will be conjuring Images of touchable monkeys. Dean. Hey, dr. Freedman. How you been? Good. How about you? How you Been? It was a good month. That's what i like to hear. Dell, the new patient Gowns blow. They keep ripping. Yeah, we're working out the kinks with some New vendors. What's wrong with the old vendors? And where are the- Dishwasher. Yeah, Everything looks good. Everything at school good? Good. I have a girlfriend. Amy. She's amazing. Well, good. You taking it slow? We haven't done it... Yet, But she's going on the pill, So we will soon. Believe me when i say I will not be The first of my friends. Oh, i know, but, um, Condoms, okay? Hey, s.t.d.s don't care About the pill. Condoms are your friend- Lots of condoms. Or better yet, you know, Wait. If this is the girl, you ought To enjoy the time before, Because once you're on The other side, you can't go back. Hello.</i> You just heard "blah, blah, Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah"? Dr. Freedman, I'm gonna have sex, And i really like her. It's not all skanky. It's right. I, like, love her And everything. Well... Now i go back To my condom speech. So i am your friendly Neighborhood Condom pusher man. Condoms. If you can save their son by Delivering the baby, i don't- 6- month preemies are at risk For brain bleeds, blindness, Hearing loss, not to mention Respiratory distress. And no one would advocate Bringing a child Into the world before She's ready, and you know it. Did you even consider the fact That this little girl Is arriving into a family Unwanted? What happens when she discovers That the only reason She was conceived was to save her Brother's life? We are talking about Saving this family from Suffering the death of a child. You gave them hope they shouldn't have. I - i'm trying to save a child's life. You discuss this stuff With us. When any of us come into An ethical gray area, We all discuss it. We decide as a practice What to do. I meant to, all right? I... I just forgot. Since when do you Forget anything? If i could get one guy To do a colonoscopy With no complaint... I mean, like i'm happy about Going all up in there. What are you looking for? I'm trying To leave you a note, But i can't find a pen that works. Well, what's-what's the note? How i can't find a pen That works. Dell has decided to go green- Tissue paper gowns, No cups, no pens. I'm all about saving the planet, but he's Killing me. You want me to talk to dell? We both know Who dell listens to. Is this naomi's idea? I have no clue What naomi's ideas are. My woman's giving me trouble. Your woman's giving you trouble. These women, cooper. What? 14-year-old kid, i've been Treating him since he was 5. Now he's found this girl- He likes her, They're gonna have sex. That's hardly a shocker. Wait, don't tell me you're getting All nostalgic. It's dean miller. Oh, man. Why does that Name sound familiar? Because we debated whether We should take him on As a patient. He's the kid who- He's h.i.v. Positive, but that wasn't the debate. The problem is, he doesn't know he's h.i.v. Positive. His parents won't tell him, And he doesn't know He could kill that girl. He thinks He has a kidney condition, And he's doing quite well. I mean, the majority Of his symptoms are from the antiviral Cocktail. How do you keep something like that From your kid for 14 years? It Was before the prognosis changed. They didn't think He was gonna be alive Long enough to understand. So That explains the first six years. I'm not allowed to tell him About the h.i.v. I'm not allowed To tell the parents Anything that dean tells me. Doctor-patient confidentiality All around. So you can't Let 'em know about the girlfriend. No, or that they're gonna do it. This is a good kid. He would not endanger this girl If he knew, and he doesn't. His hormones are full roar, Right? He likes the girl. He wants the girl. He's gotta have The girl. We've all been there. Yes, we have. Anyway... You know what? I gotta try to get His parents back in my office. He loves bugs. And he sneaks ladybugs Into the house in his pocket. He likes meatballs... And french fries. And he's still Afraid of the dark, But he thinks He's too old to admit it, So i have to pretend To forget to turn off The light at bedtime. And he likes to read. And all He wants for his 8th birthday Is to never go To a hospital again. He-he's a wonderful boy. I can see that, But, mrs. Madison, i can't. In good conscience, i can't Deliver your baby early Because i'm sure She's wonderful, too. We are good people and-and we Didn't go into this lightly- Having this baby- And we will love her. We will. It's just, We don't know her yet. And... I-i know jason. I've held jason. I- i've smelled his skin. I- i know jason. I'm so sorry. I- i've checked you out. You're a specialist. If-if anyone can deliver A premature baby safely, It's you. I wish i could help, But there's nothing i can do. How can you Look at my 7-year-old son And know he's going to be dead In a week and do nothing? Please. Addison- Don't talk to me. Addi- Don't say anything, please. Just don't. Addison, i was not trying to manipulate you. I just thought if you saw him, Maybe you would realize That you can help them. I can't help them! You gave them hope They shouldn't have, And now i am the bad guy. Addison. I told you Not to say anything to me. Hey, i really do need to Talk to you. Not now, dell. Are you okay? What's going on? Has there been bloodshed? Because naomi is in the kitchen Just inhaling the candy supply. Come on. It was low to begin with. Well, dell refuses to buy any new candy. Wait, he's withholding candy? He told me to "make due" With the sweet tarts from last halloween? Well, nobody can handle the old sweet tarts. We need chocolate. No, i told-i Told dell that he had to get- this has nothing to do With candy.</i> I can't do anything. I can't save that child. I can't deliver the baby. To the best Of my medical expertise... I cannot do... Anything. Don't beat yourself up. It's not your mess. It's naomi's. Wait, you mean the madisons? Because naomi did What she thought was right. You do what you need to do To save your family. She had no way of knowing The donor would back out, And now it's too late. But we always Discuss these things as a group. Naomi went ahead and did this Without talking to anybody. So maybe She's off her game. She's seeing a record number of patients a day - she's been really on edge lately. Yeah, it's not like her. Well, guys, i mean, She does everything. We just... Eat the candy. She's hiding something. Has anybody even asked her What's wrong? Where are you going? This i can Do something about. Who'd win in a fistfight, Naomi or addison? Not in the mood For a lecture. Oh, i'm not gonna lecture you. I'm just gonna block the exits Until you decide to tell me what's going on with You. Well, we're gonna be here a very long time. I can wait. What, they're not Even saying anything? They're just standing There. A test of wills. A battle of champions. Uh-huh. You guys are so mature. Oh, Yeah? You mentioned a fistfight. That's true. Cooper. Dean's parents are here... Thanks. And everyone else. There's a lobby Full of patients... In case anyone is interested In working here Or running this place. There's a girl dean likes, But sex is a long way off. I've had pregnant 13 year olds Whose parents Have said the same thing. Dean needs to know His h.i.v. Status Before he starts experimenting. And he will. What i'm saying is, You can't afford to wait. You have any idea what it's Like for h.i.v. Kids? A kid in chicago got shot. Another kid, they tied him to a car Bumper. That's before people were educated. Nobody needs to know but dean. He's not Old enough to deal with this, not yet. You want them to be children As long as it lasts. Things are so sweet, They can still be anything. As soon as that's over- I wish it could be longer, But it can't. You say people are educated? They'll understand? If it was your kid, You wouldn't be so sure. Could you honestly live with yourselves - do you not hear me? If he gets another kid sick, What happens when he finds out That you didn't - we will do what's best for him, and don't you overstep here. You're not leaving me Much choice. Say one word to dean, And i-i'll take your license. I will sue you For everything you've got. Nal... Come on. You can tell me anything. It's not like you to get The madisons pregnant Without discussing it With the rest of us. Now i know you must have Had a good reason. You have a good heart. Just talk to me. They paid the practice $80,000. and i don't have A good heart.</i> They had cash, And we needed the money, And so i took it Even though I did have reservations, Because naomi always keeps The trains running on time. What, uh, what do you- What do you mean? What- I keep the trains running On time. That's what i do. I run things. I mind the details. Only this time, it... Just got away from me. What got away from you? You can't tell anybody. You cannot tell the others. You have To promise. What, um, okay, i promise. What, are you-you're talking About the practice? We own the building. And-and i saw a chance To refinance the mortgage, And i thought... Now the balloon payment Is due, And no one is billing enough, And there isn't enough. There is never enough. And so i used the last of The money to make the video. Naomi- We are broke, addison. If things keep going The way they have been, The practice is finished... Soon. All right, screw them. We let them come after me. They really think A jury's gonna back them When they're perfectly happy To let their son infect some nice girl from the 'Burbs? The law says they have the right to do this How they want to do this. I'm taking My chances. I'm gonna tell dean. If they sue, They sue the practice. Why don't you think about Someone other than yourself? Whoa, naomi. Coop's just trying to do the right Thing, here. He's talking about getting us sued. There are Responsibilities here. So you think that family Has the right To hide important information From each other? Sometimes people hide things for good reason. Hiding things is no way to protect them. it is when you're the One in charge. Whoa. Whoa.</i> Everybody breathe. Cooper's Gonna figure out a way. He always does. Mm. Hey. Is it wise? Huh? Our date. Oh. Um, i haven't had time- Can we talk About this tomorrow? So you, uh, you ready To talk yet? No, i am not ready To talk... About anything. Good night, guys. Okay. Wait, hey- Good night. These women. Shots. Yeah. Cooper always Figures out a way? Cooper does not always Figure out a way. You know what's gonna make you Feel better? Mnemba. Mnemba. Monkey touching. i got the pamphlets right here. Violet. There's pretty girls In the pamphlets, And they might do dirty, Trashy things to you When i'm in the spa. Is that what this is about? A girl? Is there... Cooper do you have a woman That i don't know about, A non-cyber woman? There's no woman. Then what is it? It's bonus time. We always blow half of it On sunburns And hazy memories, coop. Violet, don't count on me This year. Want to play Naughty little schoolboy? Mistress and butler? I could be the warden, You could be my prisoner. How about... Boyfriend and girlfriend? Damn it, cooper. You really know How to dry a girl up. Okay, first of all, It was a suggestion. And second of all, I lied today. I told violet a lie. I told her I wasn't seeing anybody. Would you rather Lie to violet And play naughty schoolboy With me, Or tell her the truth And play with yourself? Why do we Have to keep it a secret? 'Cause y'all are one big Incestuous family, And i'm not joining The family. This isn't that serious. I'm sick Of keeping secrets, And i'm really sick of keeping Secrets from my best friend. So... Maybe you should Just go. I'm wearing Crotchless panties, coop. No, no. No. I am not your toy. There's a lot of other things I could be doing, You know, better things. I could be traling. I could be Touching monkeys in mnemba. Mnemba? Zanzibar. And you could be with me If you weren't Pathologically allergic To human relationships. Crotchless panties. Hey. Did naomi say anything To you? What... What do you mean? In the kitchen, did she Tell you what was wrong? Oh, no. I-i think she's Just tired. I think it's me. I've been pressuring her To talk about us. I just wanted a second chance, And i don't think She wants to give it to me. I think this is her way Of telling me that... It's over between us. No, sam. I'm sure That's not what it is. Then what is it? It's like i said. She's just... Tired. All right. Yeah, yeah, That's fine. All right. Addison... He has no idea What is going on with you. If you- No. No. This is dr. Montgomery. This is dr. Bennett. We'll be right there. I'll Drive. I'll call charlotte king To get you surgical privileges At the hospital. Dell, cancel my patients For the rest of the day. You said This was an emergency. I thought that meant there was Something in his labs. No, he's fine. Dean... Your mom and dad, They still think of you As being a kid. Well, i am... Mostly a kid. Yeah, but you're not a kid. That's not what i see. That's not what i hear From you. I think everybody needs To know the truth here. We're fine with how things Are. Then i have no choice. I have to reveal something that, legally, i'm not Allowed to. I thought we were clear about this. Come on, honey. We're Going. Dean, your parents- Stop! This is not your place. This is my child, This is my little boy, And i will do what's right. Dean's planning on having sex With his girlfriend. Mom. No... I trusted you. Why would you do this? Why is this such a huge deal? It's not the end of the world. What's going on? Dr. Freedman, Could you step out? Yeah. What happened? She's not dilated Or effaced, But her water broke An hour ago. Plus, she's bleeding, And the baby's showing signs Of distress. I've gotta get That baby out now. Naomi, if you collect The cord blood, I have a team standing by Ready to transplant. Jason's prepped and waiting. Yeah. What did you do? Her water just broke. I am the best chance Your baby has of survival, But i will walk out Of this hospital right now And leave you, your baby And your son's lives To some nervous o.b. Resident If you lie to me again. i am sick of lies. What did you do?</i> I broke my water myself... With a knitting needle. I need an o.r.
