Yeah, I'm gonna be back in the office today. Okay, great. Bye. You're going back to work? Well, we talked about this. It's been a month. You said you were ready. But if... oh, no, no. Right, right. You're right. You're right. You should go back to work. Hey, I put down the new rug. Oh, good. Do you like it? 'Cause I can get something else. It's fine. I just didn't know if you'd like it. It's fine. It's fine. It's for covering blood. It doesn't have to match the drapes. You want to hold him? He's fed, changed and burped... happy. It's the perfect time. Well, you... you've got him. Violet... Okay, breathe in and out. Shh, shh, shh. Remember what we said? This time, you're just gonna breathe in and out. You're just gonna stand there and wait. Shh. I can't. I can't. I can't. No... yes, you're just gonna stand there and wait until I open the door. Breathe in and out. Do not go in... The closet. I told you, don't ring the bell. Oh, oh. Did I wake him? No. She's in the closet again. Don't worry. I'm handling it. Yeah, no, no. I can... I can see that. Look, this really isn't a good time. Could I at least say hello to Violet and the baby? You know, since I might be his father. I'm sorry, but this really isn't a good time. Well... That was Sheldon. The rug is stained. Well, better coffee than blood, huh? You know what? I'm not gonna go back to work yet. You're not ready. You're looking at me like I have crazy head. And I don't. I don't have crazy head. I'm fine. Go back to work. You haven't been out of the house. You don't answer the door. I'm... I'm fine. You never want to hold the baby. Well, give me the baby. Pete, give me the baby. All right, Pete, you... you... you are understandably concerned because you're not sure of what's going on, so I'm gonna explain it to you. I am suffering from panic attacks, sleeplessness, agoraphobia and fear... all within the windows of behavior one expects from trauma victims. However I... I'm not cognitively altered, I am not utilizing unhealthy outlets for my feelings, such as drugs or inappropriate behaviors. I am aware of my condition and feel a normal amount of concern for my well-being. I display few signs of improvement, but... but I also display no signs of dintegration. I have the number of two therapists, the housekeeper is coming by, and the baby can fit in the closet with me. More importantly, I am a Harvard-educated medical profsional with 14 years of clinical experience of trauma and depression. So believe me when I am telling you that I do not have crazy head. Now I'm holding the baby. Go to work. We'll be fine. Watch out... Morning. Morning. Good shoes. Thanks. Yours, too. Oh, can you... Oh, yeah, yeah. Press 4? Thanks. How's it going there? It's great. It's really great. I redecorated. Oh. Good. How's it going up there? Fine. Yeah? Hey, what ever happened with that guy? What guy? The... the heart guy. The one you really liked, but he was married and his wife was your patient. What was his name? Noah. Yeah, Noah. Noah. What happened? You never told me. Nothing. I, uh, did the right thing. Good. That's... that's good. Okay. Well... I'll see you later. Because, Sam, it is time. Time for what? Cooper thinks we should hire a new doctor. I think it's time we move on. I just don't want to rush into anything. When we find...  if we find someone, I want it to be the right person. Addison, explain to the man that married his college sweetheart that the best way to get over a breakup is to move fast, throw yourself into a relationship. I mean, drunken, impulsive rebound hiring. Naomi is gone, man. You gotta let it go. What is wrong with you two? What? We made a pact. Addison and I are ignoring our problems. We are not going to talk or think about our problems anymore. Nothing even closethinking or talking about our problems. We're gonna be strong. Strong. In denial, but strong. Strong. Yeah, well, that's, um, you know... stupid. You need to talk about stuff. Really? Mm-hmm. Okay, well, how's Violet, Coop? Good. She's good. Is she? Uh-huh. Leave me alone. I've sent stuff. I've sent brownies and flowers and some very thoughtfully worded e-mails. I will get to Violet's. I'm giving her some space. Oh, okay, you know what? I gotta get to the E.R. You two don't talk about me while I'm gone, okay? It's rude. Oh, you waited for me. I like dating the chief of staff. I get special service. What do you got for me? One of my patients put a marble in his nose? Not exactly. 11 year old's dad threw her across the room, probably broke her arm. Mom looked like she was in a prizefight. Dad won the first round, but mom threw the knockout. Fun times. Wait a minute. The Larsens? My Larsens? Tammy and her parents? Page Sam... and Addison. Michelle's pregnant. Dad? I stabbed him. I stabbed my husband. Sync by steelball We're gonna get you in a cast later. You can have everybody sign it. You're just gonna have to be prepared for a little bit of itching, okay? All right. You want to talk about it? No. I can't. All right. Okay. I know it feels that way, but, um, you gotta believe me. There's a lot of people that want to help you. Okay. Well, maybe later. All right? You still playing soccer? Yeah. Starting fullback. Oh, yeah? Starting fullback. That's, uh... Yeah, see, I don't know anything about soccer. You could ask me about basketball. I'm good with the basketball. Invented by a doctor, probably to get more patients, 'cause, you know, basketball injuries. Is my dad gonna be okay? Dr. Bennett's taking care of him. He's in good hands. Okay, so crits are stable. Fast scan is negative. He's got some bruising behind his left ear, so we'll also need a head C.T. Thanks, man. Sam... It looks okay? Uh, you've got a stab wound to your abdomen. If you ask me, you're lucky that's all you got. What about Tammy and... and Michelle? Is the baby okay? Oh, so you're worried about them now? A little bit late for that, don't you think? So he says, "she's not dead. She's just electroencephalographically challenged." So it looks like everybody is settling in. Yes. Thank you, Dr. Bennett. It's good to be here. Okay. Well, if you, uh, need anything, just let me know. My door is always open. Interesting dynamic. Even a group of top-notch, einstein-type professionals feel the urge to get out of the room when the boss comes in. Oh, well... they'll warm up once we all get to know each other. Yeah. So have you had the chance to see Violet and Luke? Pete's been telling me it's a bad time, politely, as he blocks the door and refuses to let me pass. H... has he said anything to you? Um, they're... kinda not talking to me up there. But, uh, Addison and I actually had a real conversation this morning, so hopefully things will get back to normal soon. What? Nothing, nothing. It's just... well, another interesting dynamic. You being my new boss, I'm hesitant to point out that it... it might not be that easy. Heartbeat looks normal for 10 weeks. No evidence of bleeding from the trauma. So the baby's okay? Looks fine. Michelle, does this kind of thing happen often, Darren hitting Tammy, hitting you? It was an accident. I want to see my daughter. Michelle, look, I know this is hard to talk about, but you stabbed your husband. Now if you were protecting Tammy, if this was self-defen... God, you're making us sound like... It was not like that. Darren didn't do anything. You don't have to make excuses. I was cooking... and Darren and I started arguing. Tammy tried to stop us, and she got in the way, and Darren pushed her. It was an accident, but I got mad and I overreacted and I had a knife in my hand. Please. I need to be with Tammy. I need to make sure she's okay. Okay, okay. Michelle Larsen. We have a warrant for your arrest. What? No, no. No, officer. Her husband hit her. It was an accident. Okay, Michelle. No, look, she has a daughter who needs her. She's pregnant. She has a head contusion. She needs medical care. Then admit her upstairs to the medical jail ward, but her husband has a knife wound, and she's under arrest. Mom? Do not handcuff her in front of her daughter. What is happening? Tammy, it's okay. She's traumatized enough. Cooper, get her out of here. No! I want to stay with mom! No, no, no. Tammy, Tammy... Everything's okay, sweetie. I love you. Mom! I love you, sweetie. I love you. Tammy. You want me to give up a hospital bed for a kid with a broken arm? She's 11 years old, her dad hit her, she just watched her mom get hauled off by the cops. All good material for a country song, but lousy on a medical report. You look like day-old dishwater, Coop. Why don't you go grab a shower, get some rest? You've done all you can here. No, she's my patient, and I should've known what was going on. I could've stopped this. When are you going to Violet's to get your stuff? Oh, Charlotte, come on. Have you talked to her? This is not about Violet, okay? I haven't shaved and my shirt's a little wrinkled, but beneath the depressed hobo look, I am fine. You're fine? You haven't seen Violet since she got home. You live with her for six months, now you won't even pick up a clean shirt? You won't talk about it. Like you talk about you getting fired? I'm doing my job, Cooper... the one I have left. My problems aren't getting in the way of that. I have a patient. Echo is now a grand old matriarch, her crossed tusks make her unmistakable. Hello. Violet, you're there. Yeah. Well, that's how the telephone works. You call people. They answer. You speak. Right. Uh, look, I was just calling to remind you that if Lucas can't sleep, give him the sheep toy. And he likes the rain sound, but not the whale calls. Uh, well, nobody likes the whale calls. They're eerie. You're checking up on me. Yeah. I was hoping you'd be out. Well, Lucas is sleeping now, so, uh, I better go. You know what they say... sleep while the baby sleeps. The Larsens? My Larsens? Yeah. Well, my Larsens now. Well, when Michelle came to me, she and Darren wanted a sibling so badly for Tammy. When they finally got pregnant, they seemed so... So happy, I know. Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for coming with me today. Yeah, well, you know, I wanted to see Violet, and this gives us a chance to hang out. Yeah. Yeah. Things have been a little awkward, you know? Well, no. It's just, uh... It's nice to see you... outside of the office. Yeah. Yeah. No. Mnh-mnh. Apparently... there's a closet situation. Violet. Hey, it's me. Uh, Nai and I are outside. Okay. Hello? Vi? Could you... could you shut the front door, please? And... and lock it. Both locks. It's closed and locked. Okay. Hey, you guys. Hi. It's so good to see you. Hi. Oh. Oh, my God, you brought food. You're gods. Hi. Hi. Oh... my God. Hi. Oh, look at these tiny hands. Hi. Oh, baby smell. I love baby smell. It's like heroin. Aww. Yes. This is making my uterus hurt. Oh. Hello, sweetie. Oh. Hi. Yeah. He's adorable. Yeah. Hi, sweetie. I get that you think I'm a monster. But the thing is, I swear, Sam, it was an accident. You get medical care from me. You don't get sympathy. I'm not looking for your sympathy. I feel terrible. It's not that. I'm a good man. Stop talking. You're a good man? You like to hit women. You like to hit children. That doesn't make you good and it sure as hell doesn't make you a man, so stop talking. Okay, I'm... I'm a good man. And if you say one more word, I might have to show you what this good man does to people like you. Dr. Bennett, you might want to rein in that charming bedside manner. Trust me, I was reining it in. He's seizing. Darren? I need suction and an airway now. Your incision is healing well. Just keep the area, you know, clean and dry. Okay. Anything else? No. Yes. Um... you should probably get some light exercise. Just go walk around the block or something. You know, just get out. Wow. Your... your lips are moving, but your words sound just like Pete's. You were in the closet, Violet. Look, I'm... I'm doing the best I can. No, I know you are. I do. Oh, look at that smile. That's gas. Sorry to tell you. No, it is not gas. This is a smile. Yes, it is, 'cause you love your auntie Nai, don't you? Oh. Oh, isn't he beautiful? When Maya was little, I used to just watch her breathe. Isn't this the best? Sure. I am hogging the baby. I'm sorry. Who wants him? It's Addison's turn. Oh, go, go, go. Yes. But you're coming back to me. Hello, Lucas. He did just smile. He smiled. Wow, this place looks different. Pete... I'm surprised to see you here. Unless you're my 2:15 appointment, in which case, I'm glad you're finally dealing with your kleptomania. Well, that's funny. You're a funny guy. Look, I need to talk to you about Violet. Are you sure this is a good time? Okay, I've been a little overprotective. You mean territorial. Whatever psychological term you want to use is fine. I'm not here to argue with you. I told you when you brought her home from the hospital to her home, that was a mistake. She wasn't ready to face the trauma. Going back to that house is what Violet wanted. You try telling her what to do. I'd like to, but I haven't had the chance. You're handling it. I need your help. I'll stop by this afternoon. Thank you. I was eyeing that apple. The pressure in his brain is still not coming down. Continue the mannitol and hyperventilate him to a P.C.0.2 of 35. Hey. What happened? Cerebral contusion. He wouldn't stop seizing. I had to induce a barbiturate coma. Neuro put a pressure monitor in, but I can't get the pressure to come down. So he may die? Yeah. Little bit of justice. I'm just saying. Sam, if he dies... Michelle could be charged with murder. And what, Tammy has a father who's dead and a mother in jail? All right, well, now you're just making me feel bad, so stop it. Michelle, if you don't tell the truth now, you'll go to jail. I am. I just don't buy it. You're still trying to protect some image that you have of your family or of Darren. It wasn't an accident, and if he dies, you will be charged with manslaughter or worse. You have to stop protecting him, if not for yourself, then for your daughter. Think about Tammy. I am. I am thinking about my daughter. Tammy, we have some hard stuff... to talk about. Your dad is in a coma. From being stabbed? He hit his head. And Dr. Bennett's taking care of him. We're doing everything that we can. Look, I know this is really hard and I know you don't want to talk about it, and believe me, I know what that's like. But your mom's in trouble with the police, and I don't want her to be in more trouble. And this should not be your responsibility, but she says that it's all her fault, what happened, and... well, I don't believe her. And... if you told the police what really happened... well... I'm supposed to say it was an accident. But it wasn't? No. No. Tammy, look, whatever your dad did... it wasn't him. I was cutting a cantaloupe, and my dad came in. He started singing with the radio. He was being funny, but I got so mad. I don't know. It just cos over me. My dad could see it was happening. He held me to calm me down, but I bit him. And he yelled for my mom, and they both tried to stop me. I had the knife in my hand, so I stabbed him. And now he's gonna die. I see you have a new rug. Pete tells me you're afraid to leave the house. I said that you could come see the baby, not shrink my brain. Your body language is telling me that you're uncomfortable. My vocal language is telling you that I'm fine. Really. Could you be deflecting right now? Not very effectively. What do you want me to say, Sheldon? I want you to talk about how you're feeling. Do you want to hold the baby or not? Yes. I know what you're doing, Violet. It's not gonna work. I'm not doing ything. Look at this guy. Do you mind watching him? I could really use a shower. It's not gonna work, Violet. I'm a professional psychiatrist. You're not gonna confuse me with a baby. And I think you have my ears. I'm sorry about that. Yeah, I am. No. No, no. She told you? No, no, she can't take the blame for this, please. Can you give us a moment, please? Thank you. No, what are they gonna do to her? They're gonna try to get her some help. Don't you think we've tried? Michelle, I understand the urge to lie, to protect your family, but we couldn't let you say that it was your fault when it wasn't. But it is. It is my fault. I was on drugs when I was pregnant with her, for the first couple of months, before I knew I was carrying her. Michelle... You weren't there. You don't know, but I know. She had H.D.H.D. because of what I did, and then these rages started. She has them over nothing. And someone told you that her behavior was related to your drug use? The school counselor said that it's adolescence, but I know what it is. I've read enough, and she's been tested and tested and... and there's nothing else. It's me. Michelle... look, I know that you feel guilty and that you feel hurt and that you would do anything to change what happened, to change how you're feeling right now. But sometimes... you just have to push forward. Darren is the strong one. I want to talk to him. We've been through all of this together, and without him, I can't do it. I can't. He's in a coma, and then... Tammy's gonna be taken away. I'm just losing everyone I love. We had a therapeutic fencing match, and I lost. She distracted me with the baby, who is quite winning and has my ears. They're my ears. What am I gonna do now? Can I make an observation? I don't know. Can you? I know you're upset, so I'm just gonna ignore that. You told Violet you were going to leave, and you never did. You know, you talk, you send people over. Violet's smart. She knows she doesn't have twalk out that door because you are always gonna walk back in. Definitely my ears. Hey. There's a juvie officer here that wants to take Tammy. I need you to let me keep her in the hospital for another 48 hours. You did not just interrupt my dinner to ask me to hide your patient from the law? Do you really think that putting an 11-year-old girl in jail is the right thing to do? She stabbed her father. So let's help her. Let's not throw her to the wolves and just hope they decide to raise her. You're not social services. You fixed her arm. You did your job. Look, I feel bad for the kid, too. Do you? Because I really can't tell, because it's like nothing bothers you. It's like you didn't get fired, like Violet didn't almost die. It's like I'm...  it's like I'm heartless? Violet. Lucas is in his crib. I'm just trying to sleep. I love you, olet. I'm really tired, Pete. All right. Just listen. Before all this... we had a chance. We had a... we had a real chance. And then katie attacked you, and... I've been doing everything I can think of to help you get past this. But it's not helping. What I'm doing... it's not helping. So... I'm gonna go home. What? You're leaving? What about Lucas? He's in his crib, like you said. Well, you can't... you can't just walk out and leave him alone. He's not alone. He has you. Look, this isn't just about us. We have a child. You were hurt. And everyone thinks that maybe you need time, but Lucas doesn't care. He needs you now. But... and if I'm gonna be a good father, I've gotta do what's best for him. I can't fix you. I can't... make you walk out the front door. You have to do it yourself. And I have to let you. Ow! Ow! It's okay...  leave me alone! Aah! Tammy, stop it! Ah! Don't! Leave me alone. I got her. 5 milligrams of lorazepam, now. What happened? I don't know. It came out of nowhere. No! Mom's here. Mom's here. It hurts. You're hurting me! Just breathe. Tammy... Tammy, listen to me. Tell me what's going on. I don't know! I don't know! Paging Dr. Noah barnes. Dr. Noah Barnes. Addison, can I talk to you for a second? Of course. I saw, um, Tammy in a ra... in a rage last night, and her heart rate jumped and her blood pressure spiked. Uh-huh. So I'm thinking... So you're thinking that it's more, um, physiological rather than psychological? Yeah, but I went through everything. Uh, I was here all night, went through everything. Head C.T., tox screen... Yeah, they're both negative, and the psych eval isn't conclusive. Did you notice if her pupils were dilated when she got angry? Yeah, yeah. It was like... like she was on something or like there was some kind of exaggerated fear response, but again, the C.T. scan... Hey, you okay? Me? Yeah, you seem sad. Or you've seemed sad lately, and I c... it's none of my business, but... I'm not. I don't... I am sad. Okay. But I can't talk about it. Okay. It's... Order an abdominal M.R.I. and a urine catecholamine. It's just a hunch. Okay. Oh. I almost killed you with an educational rattle. Sorry. I didn't knock in case you were sleeping. I just came to get Cooper's clothes. Yeah, and to check up on me, make sure I'm not crazy. I know the drill. What, you want to hold the baby? Do I look like someone who wants to hold a baby? I'm wearing silk. Are you breast-feeding? No. No, I'm not. You know, a lot of women don't breast-feed. I don't need to breast-feed. L... like I should feel bad about it? I... I am so sick of people trying to make me feel like what I feel isn't what I should feel, if that makes any sense. No. No, Charlotte, I'm not breast-feeding, okay? What you do with your boobs is your business. I only ask because you look like you need a martini, and if you're not breast-feeding, you can have a martini. You want a martini? Yeah. Please. Naomi. Hey. Hey. I was just, uh, coming to see Addison. Oh, okay. She's, uh, she's not here. Oh, okay. You okay? Me? Yeah. Well, I guess it's just been a tough couple of days. Oh, the... the Larsens? Yeah. You want to talk about it? Uh, no, no. Uh, it's...  it's not your problem. I'm gonna get back to the hospital. Hey! I was looking for you. Hey, Nai. I'm just really busy. Oh. This Larsen thing? Yeah. I'm waiting on the results of an abdominal M.R.I. For Michelle? I thought she was fine. No, for Tammy. Oh, but I thought that... Is everything okay? I... I can't tell you everything all the time, Nai. I like gin. Gin is good. Gin is good. So... what's wrong with ya? I mean, other than the whole "psycho chopped the baby out of your belly and ran" thing. Other than that? Is... is there something other than that? You tell me. I'm just a chick with a drink. No judgments. Oh. I get it. You don't want to open up to me. I know. I'm not the touchy-feely type. I got fired for being heartless. Cooper apparently agrees. Maybe he's right. It's the baby. He have 11 toes or something? He's perfect. He's absolutely perfect. He's the baby in the commercial, he's so perfect. And I... I look at him, and I feel... nothing. I can't... feel anything... ever since the... I mean, there's this pressure to be all "mommy," and I'm just... I'm not. I'm not ready or something. I just... I don't... I don't want to deal with him. I just want to... stick him in the freezer. Maybe thaw him out later when I'm ready to deal with him. That's a... that's a horrible thing to say, isn't it? Yes. Oh. But the horrible things they're... things that need to be said. Can I ask you question? Shoot. Where the hell is Cooper? He's busy saving a patient, trying to make up for the fact that he didn't save you. What? Is he... blaming himself for... except for the part he blames on me. I called him that night. I was the reason he didn't walk in that door and save you. I guess you owe me. Tammy has a very rare tumor on her ovary called an ectopic pheochromocytoma. It intermittently releases an excess of adrenaline, Causing a rise in heart rate, blood pressure, All leading to fear, anger and Tammy's sudden rages. And, Michelle, nothing that you did or do not do During pregnancy caused this. But we found it, which means we can fix it. Yeah, I can remove it laparoscopically. Without the need for a large incision. Which means at all those moods that you've been feeling, they should stop. All this time, I've been blaming myself. I can't believe it. You're gonna be okay. But dad isn't. But you cannot feel guilty for something you couldn't control. But I do. And taking out this tumor, it won't change that. It won't change the way I feel. I've tried steroids, fluid restriction. Nothing's working. Neuro says he's not a surgical candidate. I'm gonna take Tammy into surgery now. Okay. How's she doing? She'll be fine. Yeah, physically, but she will not forgive herself, and nothing I said was gonna get her... you guys think that when we die, There's like a bookkeeper, and he tallies up everything we did... all the lives we saved, all the people we helped, and if we've done enough good in the world, that it makes up for the times that we just completely fail? No. I don't think anyone's keeping score. I think we do what we can, we hope for the best, and that's all anybody can do, right? I think, uh, I think that we... we do what we can do when we know how to do it, and it hurts. It just... it hurts. Violet's in the kitchen. Hello. Hi. Come here. Hi. Yes. Yeah. Hmm. So I have this 11-year-old patient, stabbed her father. Turns out she has a pheochromocytoma, which made her... aggressive. Um, Addison's gonna remove it, but this girl just can't forgive herself. Maybe she needs more time. Time? So should I offer her time? Well, what do you want, Cooper, a magic pill? Bad things happen. You can fix them, maybe, but it doesn't mean they didn't happen. So don't go in there to that girl and try to sugarcoat it and pretend it's all better when it's not. Well, I should've seen it. You know, I could've stopped it. You are not responsible for what that girl did any more than you're responsible for what happened to me. I'm sorry, Violet. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner. You came when you could. No, no. I'm sorry that I did not come sooner... before, with Katie. You came when you could. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Mm. Shh, shh. You're here now. So a bad thing happened, and I can't change that. And sometimes the things people say to try to make you feel better, they just come out sounding... stupid. So, um... you tell me what you need. What if he dies? What if he dies, and I never get to tell him I'm sorry? Nobody beat me, nobody tried to steal my baby, nobody stabbed me, but... I am wounded, Sam. Noah? Oh, my heart is broken. And I shouldn't even complain about it because... nothing happened. I mean, nothing happened to me, not like what happened to the Larsens and Violet. You know, sometimes... I'm almost jealous of them? Because everybody can see their injuries, so they have a right to be messed up. I sent noah back to his wife. I did the right thing. And... my heart is broken. Yeah. Nai would what to say to you right now. I can't talk to her, though. I just can't... talk to her, 'cause it's like... she's not our Nai anymore. Exactly. I'm sorry, dad. I'm so sorry, daddy. Hi. Hi. Nice shoes. I hate talking about shoes with you. I... I hate that at's all we talk about. I miss you. I... where are you? Where... where did you go, Addison? Like I said, nice shoes. You came. No, wait. I... I need you to listen. Just listen? Um... I want to be a good mother. I want to be a good mother so badly, And, um, I'm trying to figure out how to do that, how to do that when I look at this baby and I feel... Uh... Katie stole something from me. She changed me, and I don't know how to change it back. But I'm trying to be a good mother, okay? Okay. And... and you're right. You're right. It's not... it's... it's not just about you and me anymore. And being a good mother means doing what's best for your child. And you may not understand this, and you may never... forgive me for it, but I... I walked out that door tonight to do what's best for Lucas. This is what's best for Lucas. You're what's best for Lucas. This is me being a good mom. Violet?
