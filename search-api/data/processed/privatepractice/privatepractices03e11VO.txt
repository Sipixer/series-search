A.V.M., sweetheart. A.T.M. Is where you get money. You're not gonna see the a.V.M. Here. That's just a cluster of blood vessels. That aren't supposed to be there, And if you pop them, I'm gonna die? W--no. Um, sloan, it's just A tangled cluster of blood vessels under the baby. I'm not gonna go anywhere near them, So I won't be popping them. I'm gonna go in, uh, laparoscopically And very carefully cut one of the amniotic bands From around the baby's legs. And then he'll be okay? He'll be able to walk? Then he'll be perfect. Well, that's what you said last time. That was my fault, sloan. I shoulda let her finish the surgery the first time. Now that is an apology.</i> What is that? What is that thing right there? Is that something growing out of his head? That is a penis. Sloan, you're gonna make yourself crazy Trying to read the ultrasound. Has her blood pressure always been this high?

The kid is articulate. I honestly thought maybe he had called me there As a cry for help so I could see this, but he's got What I'm pretty sure is a staph infection on his arm, So maybe he just needed that cast off. I've got him at st. Ambrose for the arm, And he is staying there until that house is clean. Well, that might take some time. Okay, but if it takes too much time, I'm calling child protective services. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Hey, coop. How's it going with charlotte? I can't forgive her. I'm trying, but I just...

Which could happen in a clean house. You know that. And you're treating it at st. Ambrose.

How are you gonna handle spit up in the mouth? It happens quite frequently. I can handle it. I grew up, you guys. You all ran off to live on the beach, And... I went and grew up on you. Okay, now that's just crazy talk. I think I might move here. What? What? (naomi) what? I could join your practice. This is l.A. I'm a plastic surgeon. I'd bring in a fortune. And you could help me raise the baby. (laughs) (laughs) are you out of your mind? Please tell me you're not... Serious. Addison and I are good together. Tell him. Mark... Lexie... Like you said, she's a kid. But you. You know me. You get me. You all do. You're my friends-- My old friends, my good friends. And this? This feels right. It feels really right. Â¶ You hungover? You were the one who was drunk, not me. I wasn't the one talking about moving my whole life down here. That wasn't drunk talk, addison. Oh, come on, mark. Let's not talk about it. I want you focused on the surgery. Montgomery. How ng you gonna need o.R. Three? Uh, two hours tops. Good. Who's hot stuff? Uh, um, dr. Charlotte king, dr. Mark sloan. Plastics. Sexology. Sexology.

Haven't I been saying we need a plastics guy? Oh, god. Well, we'll talk, right after my daughter's surgery. Actually, you can talk now on your way out. On my way out? Yeah, you're not allowed within 1,000 feet of my o.R. And don't let him join the practice While I'm in surgery. (violet) thank you for letting me come see you. Do you remember when this first started, This, uh, need to keep everything? Cody made at. Did it have anything to do with the death of your husband? Cody will grow into this in a few years. These erasers-- They are all still good. (chuckles) This can be repaired. How would your life be different if you threw this out? I need it. Why? Because you never know... (chuckles) When you're gonna need something. And then if yothrow it out, you don't have it anymore. (chuckles) I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm a little eccentric. I know what people think. But I'm not crazy. Surgical time-out's complete. Let's prep the belly. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Sam. Is everything okay? Everything is perfect, 'cause you can't walk away from me in here. Look who's making up the rules now. I am at work, sam. You're really going to talk about My very, very personal life while I'm at work? No. No, no, no. Hello, everyone. (surgical team speaks indistinctly) I am going to talk to you about dogs. (sighs) (door opens) Where's my mom? Why isn't she here? She's on her way. How you feelin'? I want to go home. Yeah, I bet. Hey, um, I have a question for you. Do you have any family around here, Any aunts, uncles? No, why? Well, I'm working with your mom on cleaning your house up, And it'd be better If you had someplace else to stay for a while. No, I need to be with her. I take care of her. Well, would you like that to be different? You don't understand. Sh-she needs help, cody. She needs more help than you can give her. And this separation would only be temporary. You can't do that. She'd be... It'd be like when my dad and my sister died. Do you mind if I ask you about that? My dad had us weekends. So they were divorced? I was sick, so it was just my sister that Friday. They ran off the road in latigo canyon. I have to stay with my mom. And then you have golden retrievers. Now golden retrievers, like labs, Whether they be blond or chocolate, They're pele dogs. They're all about pleasing you, All about making you happy. You can neglect them, you can ignore them, You can walk all over them, But still, making you happy is their first thought. Snipping the first band. Now I would be fine if you took up with A golden retriever or a lab-- heck, even a schnauzer. But sloan? Sloan is a dachshund. Dachshunds like to eat poop Right up off the street-- other dogs' poop. They're more concerned with their own needs Than they are with making you happy. They're filthy and immoral-- immoral? They're immoral dogs? The owners of dachshunds are desperate-- Desperate for affection. But it's the wrong kind of affection, The kind that makes you always take care of them. Oh, my god. What happened? The a.V.M. Just blew. She's bleeding all over. I can't see a thing. Convert to open. With the baby still inside her? Yes. 10-blade. (monitor beeping erratically) Was this my fault? I was talking. W-we were talking. I'm capable of talking and operating simultaneously. You blew the a.V.M.?! Not on purpose. (naomi) I already told him that. Well, then what the hell happened?! Stop yelling at her. (naomi) don't yell. She lost a lot of blood, but she's gonna be okay. And the baby? I think he's gonna be fine. You think? I hope. I'm sorry. The a.V.M. Is very delicate, mark. It's directly below the dissection, And it--it--it-- it just blew. I need to see her. Okay, look, mark, she's gonna be in bad shape when she wakes up. She hemorrhaged. I had to open her up. She's gonna be much worse than last time. The last thing she needs is to look up And see you hovering, terrified. What do you expect me to do? Why don't we just take a walk? We can just calm-- naomi, don't talk to me like I'm a child. I'm not a 12 year-- Mark, please, just go with naomi. She knows what she's talking about. Fix this. That baby has to be okay. He will. He will. I care about mark sloan. I loved him once. And he was our best friend. And, yes, he's done a lot of stupid things, But he also let all of us do a lot of stupid things. He let us do a lot of stupid things And he never judged us. He's not just a dog, sam. Sure, he's got a screwed up moral compass, but so do I. He's a good man. (exhales) this baby's gotta be okay. I didn't even know he had a sister. Yeah, and the fact that she didn't even mention it... Yeah. It has to be the root of the problem. Hey, where's cody? His mother took him home. I'm calling d.C.F.S. D.C.F.S. Is not the answer-- She snatched cody out of the hospital And brought him back to the house of horrors! Why are you shouting at me? Because you have no concern at all for this boy. The best thing for that child Would be to have a healthy mother, and frankly, The best thing for you would be to stop displacing your anger. What is that supposed to mean? You're angry at charlotte. You're angry at yourself. You keep lashing out at everybody else So you don't have to take responsibility. I am trying to help cody. By putting him in foster care? By ripping him away from his mother? By breaking his heart? Get a grip, cooper. Deal with your problems. No, no, cooper. You gottathink talk to her about that.O me?Em. I'm serious. I am out. Oh, you're out? You're out. You don't get to be out! How many times--how many times have I had to listen to you Go on and on and on about allan Or sheldon or, oh, my god, pete? Pete this and pete that, violet. And look how well that worked out. Look how healthy I am. Yay me. I am super normal. Point taken. Thank you. Talk to her... Not me. Work it out or not. You love each other, you don't--figure it out... With charlotte. I'm calling d.C.F.S. Is there some reason why we are eating in silence yet again? May I be excused? Maya, why don't you just tell me what's going on? We can talk out it. Can I be excused, too? Betsey, naomi went to a lot of trouble-- Thank you for breakfast. May I be excused? Sure, honey. Yeah. Well, at least you know why yours isn't speaking to y. I didn't kill her mother, you know? I'm just gonna say it to her, you know, 'cause at some point, you gotta grow up. Dell, she's-- I know she's 7. I-I know. But I-I can't feel like this every day. You know, I can't keep being treated like the enemy. Well, maybe all she needs is an apology. What am I apologizing for? I did thright thing. Heather's faced was burned off. You know, she burned her face off getting high. You really think I should've let betsey into that room? Okay, you're in mourning, And, uh, you are my friend, and you've been through hell, So I've been really gentle with you. But I think I am not gonna be gentle with you anymore. I think I'm just gonna tell you the truth Because that's what I would want you to do for me. Are you okay with that, if I'm not gentle anymore? Yes. Okay. I think you should've let her in that room. I think you should've let her say good-bye to her mother. I think pete was right, and I think you owe him an apology. And I think that betsey has a right to be pissed. I would be pissed, too. 7 or 37, I would be pissed. (monitor beeping rhythmically) Mo Hey, sloan. It's addison. Where am I? You're in the hospital in los angeles. You just had surgery, but everything is fine. You and the baby are fine. Where's my mom? (cries) I want my mom. Well, mark's here. Your dad's here. And he's gonna be here in just a few minutes. I don't want him. I want my mommy. (crying) I don't want any of this. I don't want a baby. I just want to go home. I want my life back. I want to go home. I'm delirious. I am delirious with exhaustion. Mm. Lucas thought it was morning at 2:00 a.M. And then again at 3:00 a.M. And at 4:00, And I'm--I feel like I'm undeater. See? That's what I'm talking about. You're a grown man, and you're a wreck. That's what you were talking about to who? To myself... (laughs) in my head. Sloan sloan--she's... She's pretty simple, you know, and young. And her mom had her when she was young. And I don't think she's even thought about adoption. I don't think anybody's counseled her. And I think she feels trapped, And I think it's my responsibility as her doctor</i> To give her her options. Well, of course it is. What's the problem? Mark. He really... Wants this baby. He wants to raise it with her. Are we talking about the plastic surgeon? (laughs) oh, the contempt That seeps from your every word-- Do you have that for every plastic surgeon or just, You know, ones that I sleep with on the floor of my office? (laughs) I just-- I don't think there's anything to debate, addison. You're her doctor, she's a kid-- she's 18. Yeah, well, still, it's your responsibility To counsel her, give her the options. Yeah. Back in new york, you know, mark and I were together, And, um... I got pregnant. And I told him about it, and he was excited, And... I... Wasn't, And I had an abortion. I didn't talk to him about it first. I made the decision for both of us. And he wanted it. And he wants this one. (sighs) One thing can't inform the other. Your loyalty to your friend and your--your guilt Or your rerse, it can't inform your patient care. You gotta give her the options and let her choose. Maybe it'll go his way. And I'm sorry. It sounds just awful. (sighs) thanks. Don't fall asleep on my head. I'm up. I'm up. (knock on door) How's the baby? Heartbeat's holding strong. (sighs) I haven't taken my eyes off it. Good. That's, uh... That's good. (monitor beeping rhythmically) What? This midlife crisis, uh, you're having, All this talk about moving to l.A.-- Whatever is--is going on with you, Something worse is going on with addison. And I'm not about to let her be your landing pad. What the hell do you care, sam? Well, she--she just spends a lot of time, uh, Trying to take care of everyone at the practice, So, you know, I'm trying to take care of her. I'm saying, I like you, mark, But what you've been doing around here, It's not you at your best. And I ask again, what the hell do you care? I just care. Hey. Looking for me? Yeah. I wanted to let you know I have a staff meeting tonight. I'm not sure when I'm gonna be home. (exhales) you lied. Why did you lie? I just want to know why. I told you why. No, y-you told me that there are things you can't t-- I told you I didn't want to go there. Were you ever gonna marry me? Was that a lie, too? Oh, can you answer the question? The nerve to do this here. Can you not ask it? I have answered it?!      What? You, uh, you seen addison? No, not recently. Not down here. Oh. Your son? Yeah. And you bring him to work? Naom cool with that? I'm sorry. I, uh, I'm about to have a kid. Or my kid--my kid is about to have a kid. And, uh, you can skip the grandpa jokes, Because they have all been made. My kid, she's, uh... Ashe's young. She's gonna need a lot of help. So I think it's really great That you get to bring your baby to work. L.A.'s a pretty liberal place. Naomi's a pretty liberal boss. You know, I don't think I've ever even held a baby. I mean, obviously, I held lots of kids During my peds rotation when I was a resident. But I don't--I don't... I don't think I've ever even held a baby. Here. Go ahead. Okay. Just be gentle. I just got him quiet. Hi. Ooh. Hello. Wow, you're cute. (sighs) Shh. It's okay. (lucas coos) So have I got this straight? You think my favorite hobby is sitting around Dreaming up ways to emasculate you? You humiliated me When you bought me into the practice without asking me. That made me less of a man. You made yourself less of a man When you spent all the money in your bank account. You know what? Let's just... Start over here. No, no, no, no. This is good. Get it all out. This is good. Charlotte king finally opens up. Come on. What's that supposed to mean? I mean, I am there for you and there for you, But all you want to do is screw and not talk and-- All I want to do is screw? All I want to do?</i> Oh, you are gonna have to look in the mirror, Because the pot is definitely calling the kettle black. Screw is all you know how to do. No, no, no. No, I'm a person. I'm a whole person with feelings and friends And a practice full of patients, and what do you have? You. Don't you say that like it's an insult. Don't you dare. I am not a freak. I'm nothe freak, charlotte. I'm not the freak that got fired because I'm heartless. Charlotte-- No, you're the freak who needed me to bail you out, Which is how I know I'm not heartless. The 50 grand I spent to buy your ass a place in this practice Proves I am not heartless. And we're back to the money again? You are such a bitch that you can't-- I do what needs to be done. I do whaneeds to be done, and you resent me. Why, 'cause I don't go all crybaby every five seconds? It's not about crying. It's not about crying. It's about being a person. It's about being a normal woman, for once. It's not my fault you're not a man. So don't tell me I'm not a woman. (clatters) I literally--I am full of hatred right now. Oh, join the freakin' club. W-- Do you know how ridiculous it is that you would take me aside-- Could you answer one questio you can't separa-- I have answered it. There's the heartbeat. And it's strong. (monitor beeping rhythmically) So... I have to ask you this. Has anyone ever talked to you about adoption? What, like when you pick a family from the "pennysaver"? No. That's just in "juno." No, in real life, there are agencies, And all they do is screen families. They find you safe, wonderful families Who would love your baby as much as you do. There are agencies. In fact, we have one at the practice. Don't tell mark that we're having this conversation, 'cause I know that he'd freak out, and, like, All my stuff is still at his apartment. No, I'm--I'm your doctor, so ian't tell yone Anything that we're talking about. And--and for the record, I think that you could be a great mom, sloan, And I know mark would be an amazing-- So these agencies... Like, what exactly do they do? (matt nathanson's "bulletproof weeks" playing) We are breaking up. Coop, we're having a fight. No, we're done. I'm done. You don't get to be done. You don't get to decide what happens to us. Good-bye, charlotte. Okay, this... This is the problem right here. You won't man up and face stuff. You want to just cut and run. We're having a fight. No, thproblem is... You are a sex toy I found on the internet. The problem is, you're just a trashy little girl Who's trying to please her dead daddy, And I shouldn't have expected much from you. My bad. You act warm, all cute, cuddly cooper. But the bitch of it is, you're the one who's heartless, Not me. You. You're a mean, cold, miserable bastard Who doesn't know a thing about forgiveness. You screwed another man, I forgave you. Â¶ what happened to... Â¶ That's just sex. I was talking about us. I was talking about love. You're supposed to love me. Â¶ ...Was flat Â¶ Â¶ what happened... Â¶ Were you ever planning on marrying me? Â¶ to that? Â¶ Doesn't matter now, does it? Â¶ They can't just come and take my boy. D.C.F.S. Does not want to take cody. They will, but they don't want to. But if you and I can show them that you're fixing the problem, Then they will do anything they can to have cody stay here. Mom, just throw some stuff out. Maybe cody can go to his room so you and I can talk? It'll be okay, mom. Just listen to her, okay? You can do it. I know you can. (door closes) (cries) I can't. This doesn't fill the hole. This doesn't make up for divorce and death. You didn't tell me about your daughter. You didn't tell me because what happened was unthinkable. It's unbearable. But this isn't working anymore, is it? It's not working to keep away whatever it is That's eating you from the inside. Did you divorce your husband or the other way around? How old was your daughter? How did you find out they'd been killed? Did you have to identify the bodies? How did you tell cody that his father and his sister were dead? I divorced him, okay? I didn't love him anymore. He was a good husband and a good father, but I... I tossed him out like a sack of garbage. And if I hadn't done that, then my daughter Wouldn't have been in that car in that place at that time. You don't know that. I do know that. (sniffles) You want this gone? There. (sobs) How about that? How about this? (crying) Maddy was 4 1/2. She wanted to stay with cody because he was sick, But I made her go with her father because I felt guilty On the weekends. And he loved them more than anything! (grunts) He loved them, and he loved me, And I didn't want him! (sobs) No. No, they can't. No, they can't take cody. (crying) they can't take him. They can't take him. Hey, hey, hey. Did you see what you did? You threw stuff out. Can you leave it out there? Can you do that? I think so. I'm ellie farraday, d.C.F.S. Hi, ellie. We're just doing a little housecleaning. (elevator bell dings) (clicks button) (door closes) (motor whirring) I'm sorry. For everything, I'm sorry. That's quite a punch you've got. (ding) You coming? Oh, no. I'm just riding up and down. Lucas likes the motion. (whispers) yeah. You like the motion. (makes kissing sounds) I don't care what sam says. This is ideal. What did sam say? Nothing. Forget about s This is ideal. Three parents-- No one gets overwhelmed, Everyone still gets to have a life. Mark-- This is our second chance. Don't you see it? What if there wasn't a baby? Why? What happened? Nothing. Nothing happened. The baby's fine. It's just, what... What if sloan changed her mind or there wasn't a baby, Would you still want to move down here, Join the practice, be with me? Because you keep asking, and you paint a pretty picture. And I'm just lonely enough and I'm just scared enough And I'm just freaked out enough that if you ask me again... I might say yes. So I'm asking you not to ask me again If it's not about me. If you're just heartbroken or in love with someone else Or you just want me to help you with a baby That you may or may not be able to raise... Don't ask me. Because I don't know... Anything. I don't know... Anything anymore, Except, I can't fall in love with a man Who's in love with someone else. That much I know. I can't do that again. So please, if you're still in love with the grey girl, Then go back to seattle. But if you're not... I mean, if you're serious... And you want me... Then ask again.
