- Focus. Come here. That guy with the smile, is he single? - Come on. Naomi, come on. - What? That guy's the enemy. This is war. This is men doing combat, guy time. I'm sorry. Go, team. You want to play? Ball up. Come on Nai, can we please go now? These bleachers, they reek of high school and... urine. I am sowing my oats. These are oats. These are oats that are not married cardiologists. There is nothing going on with Noah, okay? It was a flirtation, but he is married, so it's over. At least in a bar, there would be cocktails. But thoats wouldn't be wearing shorts. Nice shot. I could kill myself. She's going home with me tonight. Come on, man. This bastion of men being men is being expropriated. It's being taken over by women. - But you like women. - And you know what? I'm living with one with no sexual benefits. I'm sleeping with one who's way too complicated. And the one place where I can just be men, there are women. Fellas, we gonna play, or what? This is like watching gladiators, but without the killing. You know, it's... it's very male. Do not answer it. Do not answer... excuse me. I will... I'll be there as soon as I can. I kept telling myself that it was nothing. And I'm just being paranoid after everything that's happened. Noah didn't want to bother you, but then it got worse. Temp's 103. We need to start... cooling measures. So what do you feel? Any... chills, nausea? Both. And my heart is racing. I'm so sorry to call you in on a sunday. I hope we didn't pull you away from something. A date with your guy? She has C.V.A. tenderness, probably pyelo. I'm gonna start her on cephalosporin while her cultures are pending. You're gonna want to keep her hydrated until she's able to tolerate P.O.S. She's got a kidney infection. You didn't want to just say it like that, like a normal person? I'm sorry. I didn't want to call. I'm just thanking you. That's my job. Private Practice S02E19 What women want</i> I need your help. - It's not a good time, Violet. - I'm sorry. I just... I can't... tie my shoes. My shoes a no longer visible to me, and I would wear shoes that don't tie... but my feet are swollen or bigger or something, and and shoes that tie are the only ones that fit. And... and I gotta go because I got the... - ultrasound this morning... - Stop it. with Pete. It's so weird. I mean, I... know he wants to be a part of it, but we really could be sitting there looking at Sheldon's baby. Vi, can I... - can I go back to sleep? - I can't tie my own shoes. Okay, I'll be right there. While you're up, maybe we can get some breakfast. My iron's low, and they serve sausage biscuits till 9:00. - I know you love sausage. - I love sausage. That'll wake you up. Late night. The blonde from the basketball court? She's a nurse. Nice shot, Pete. Come on. Is the dating life that bad? You gotta have guys hitting on you all the time? Last one? Married. He ask you out? He is married. Although he did say... - That... - What? He said I was breathtaking. Think he could make you happy for a little while? You have no qualms about being with someone who's married? It's, you know, it's a little messy, but just because he's married doesn't make the feelings go away. - I've been there. - Yeah, well, I... - am not there. - All I'm saying is, you never know. He could be the greatest guy you ever had. 'cause you never had me. We can ride horses this weekend? Your day, your pick. I'm gonna get a pony! Not exactly the way the conversation went. Women... they learn early. It's Brandon, Brandon Henry. I was a patient of yours a few years back. I was the kid with... who never spoke Brandon? Well, it seems like I got over that and the other problems. You look... amazing. You'd never know that I was the kid with the cleft palate scars. Or the runny nose or the ear infections. You're like a new man. It's not just the plastic surgery. That's Lyla. I've never met anyone who had a line like that for everything. I find it hard to believe he was actually quiet. Did you just come down here to show off yourself, your girl? - No, I got a sorehroat. - Yeah, from all the talking. Funny. I have an appointment with Dr. Bennett. Let me take you back. - It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you, too. - How'd you meet lyla? - She was my lab partner. My lab partner set me on fire. Open up. When he was a kid, he single-handedly kept my first practice afloat. His mother called him "her little lemon." - Really, she really called you that? - It was true, even if it didn't help with the self-esteem. Now I have Lyla. You know, I bought her a ring. I just need the nerve to ask. Dr. Bennett, is there something wrong? You've got a lump in your right peritonsillar region. Tonsillar, like tonsillitis? I'd like to do a biopsy on it, though. I think it's helping. I don't feel like I'm gonna vomit anymore. You're almost to your second trimester. The nausea usually lets up by then. - How about otherwise? - No visions, no delusions, no crazy crazy. I see Violet's been using her technical terms. It wasn't easy. I wasn't easy. It took Dr. Turner so long to find the right meds to get my delusions in check, and then... when I got pregnant and needed to go off of them... It's funny, my life was on hold for so long, and now all I want is to be a good mom. - Ultrasound's ready. - If the nausea returns, press these buttons on your wrist. That should help. In the meantime, why don't you work on your breathing? And then Violet will be back to take you in. So she's good? - She's excited about seeing the baby. - I guess it's that kind of day. Everyone's excited about seeing the baby. - My ultrasound. - Oh, right. That's today. - You did want to come? - Of course. I look forward to it. Go a little to the right, Dell. Little more. Sometimes they like to hide. My daughter was the same way. She moves a lot. I bet she's active. My mom used to say I was hard to catch. Before she died. I wish she could see this. There. There... we... are. How is she? She's bigger, right? - Here, let me. - It's a she. I know it is. I'm afraid that the fetus didn't survive. But I can see her. She's right there. I'm so sorry. There's no heartbeat. - There has to be a mistake. - I know this is hard to hear. I can feel her moving right now. - Why don't we talk this through? - She's still alive. I know it. Katie's not answering her cell phone. I called her roommate, but she said Katie hasn't come home. We've got to find her. We don't know how long ago the fetus died. The decaying tissue could lead to sepsis. She needs a D&C. You can't perform a D&C on a woman who still thinks her baby's alive. Maybe her body will just pass the tissue naturally. It's too dangerous to wait for that. This baby represents everything that she has overcome, so if I can talk to her, - if I can separate that from the baby... - And what if you can't? She saw the monitor. There was no heartbeat, - and she still didn't believe it. - I'll get her to understand good. Find her, talk to her. But, you know, do it fast. Good game yesterday. How come I never went when we were married? That's what Bryce was saying. He said he'd never seen you around. The... the guy with the smile and the nice teeth? He was asking about me? Did you want him asking about you? Maybe. He's cute. He's real cute. You're gonna ask me to call Bryce for you, aren't you? Please. Just... give him my number. I need some fun. You know, I need some post-Archer fun. - Sure. Fine. - Really? You are so sweet. You are the best ex-husband ever. I am. - She's in a good mood. - That's 'cause I'm pimping for her. - I'm pimping for my ex-wife. - Pimping? I'm setting her up with Bryce. - That's what I said. - What the... Why did I say that I would set her up with Bryce? - I don't know. - I... thank you. What is it? Cancer? It's cancer? I'm sorry, Brandon. Am I gonna die? You're not gonna die. You're gonna fight this, okay? We're gonna fight it. So... what's next? - What can we do? - We'll run a few more tests to... stage the cancer. Depending on how advanced it is, we can determine the... best course of treatment... - chemo, radiation, surgery. - I can't believe this. I've been sick my whole life. I thought I was finally done with it. I'm 22 years old. I don't smoke. - How did I get a tumor in my throat? - The biopsy was positive for H.P.V., - which is human papillomavirus. - I thought that was an S.T.D. It is, but it can cause abnormal cell growth, which can lead to cancer. Oh, my God. It's okay. I have H.P.V. I caused your cancer. Daddy can't draw a horse, but he's taking me riding. That's great. Can I talk to you for a second? Baby, just stay here and draw, okay? Everything okay? Everything's good. Really good, actually. I got a promotion. - That's great. - The promotion is in St. Louis. She would have better schools. She could play in a front yard without cars flying Which one of those makes up for her losing her father? I know I'm asking a lot, but I want us to talk about this. This is exactly what you said last time, when I wanted to pursue custody. You said we'd talk about it, that we'd work it out, that I'd always be involved. I want you to be involved... vacation, holidays. Listen, it's a fresh start, okay? Away from here, away from all the bad stuff. Look at my picture, mommy. That's beautiful. Can you go grab your sweater, sweetie? Go if you want, but Betsey stays. You can't take her. Don't do this, Dell. You asked me to get it together. I have. This is good for her. Ready? Let's go. Come on. Unbelievable. Late night, now lunch. I try to utilize all aspects of the day. But you... work, work, work. This is... Pete. Noah's wife is a patient of mine. I'll see you back at the... practice. So I just got Morgan's labs back. She's responding to theephalosporin. I'm just gonna say this, even though I shouldn't, even though... You know, you marry someone and... you think it's love, you want it to be. You want to be a good man. You want to be the kind of man who... But I have never felt for a woman the way I feel about you. And I know you feel it, too. I know it, and I would never ask you to admit it, but... I need to feel at least like I'm not crazy in this, that it's not just me making up something in my own head so I'm not so ashamed. I have to... get these lab results back to Morgan. I didn't think H.P.V. had any effect on men. And we used condoms. We were always safe. Women get cervical infections, and men... People don't think of oral sex as sex. Oh, God. I didn't know. I didn't tell you 'cause I didn't... I didn't think it could hurt you. - You must really hate me. - No, baby. I love you. We're gonna fight this together, remember? So that's good? Right? Honey? I was thinking that it might be worth considering having a hospital-based doctor to monitor the rest of your pregnancy. - You want to drop me as a patient? - No. It's just... I have such a heavy patient load, and it's... it's often difficult for me to get here. I could find you a great doctor right here. I understand you're busy. I live with a doctor. I get it. I just... I thought we were friends. I mean, who else is gonna take my mind off my anxiety by telling me about their sex life? I just want you to have the best care possible. Really. So I'm going to... send over a list of names. Okay? I'm sorry. You got a minute? You waiting on a call? I was gonna make one. Or not. It's Bryce. I can't do it. Brandon's test results are back. Stage IV. The cancer's spread to the mandible bone. - Stage IV? - Yeah, so we do chemo and radiation, see if we can attack it. I'd go straight for the surgery. Resect the mandible. Odds are better. You know what that surgery would do to this kid? - It could save his life. - You want him to lose part of his jaw, wind up - disfigured, drooling? - His life comes first, Coop. I realize that surgery may feel preemptive, but chances are he's gonna get there anyway. His life is important to me. His... whole life. He's coming in tomorrow to talk treatments. If we can tell him chemo and radiation, then there's some hope of a normal life there. I want to give him some hope. Do... men not understand the concept of a phone? You know, how to pick it up and to dial it? You know, I'm out there, I am sowing my oats... Heather wants to move to Missouri, and she wants to take Betsey. God, Dell. That's awful. I pushed her to get better, and she has. And now she has this opportunity, and it's gonna be my fault that she has to say no. This is not your fault. God, when Sam and I were going through our divorce, it never occurred to me that he would be absent from Maya's life. I'd never want to jeopardize that for Maya. I know. How can she think this makes sense? I'm just gonna call her. A piece of advice... if you call her mad, she's never gonna hear what you say, even if you're right. You gotta do this in person if you want it to work. What are you doing here? I... I thought we should talk, after this morning. That was weird, huh? I was ally freaked out for, like, an hour, and I then I thought, what would Dr. Turner say? She would say, "step back, look at the situation." - Good. - And then I figured, you know what? Mistakes happen. Why get upset? Look, I got these really cute layettes. She's gonna love this, right? It's beautiful. Anyway, look, I gotta go. I have a friend coming over. Could we talk in the morning, first thing? I have work. - It's really important. - Why? Dr. Montgomery feels bad about this morning, and she wants to give you another ultrasound. I could see my baby again? And there are a few ideas I'd like to run by you. I'll come by tomorrow, first thing. He's not back yet. - Do you expect him back soon? - He's getting me soup. - Soup's good. - I despise soup. But it helps when you're queasy, which I am. Sit down if you want to. You're queasy. The word "queasy makes me feel queasy. What are you doing? What are you doing? That's my kitchen. - Refrigerator was my first clue. - Are you hungry? Natural antacids, mineral-rich foods, fizzy drinks... they all help with nausea. Now I know you hate me, but - it actually works. - Hate is a strong word. So the baby's father... is he gonna get in on this circus anytime soon? Eventually. You know, one of them. I mean, Pete or Sheldon - one of them is the father. - And do they... - want to be involved? - They did, but now Sheldon's not talking to me, and Pete... he pushed, he wanted to come to an ultrasound, and now he's just... indifferent. - Is that funny? - No, I just... I had this visual of Sheldon wearing a babybjorn. Right. Pete would... Pete would use an indian sari and make a sling. You really think uncle Coop would do any better? You know what Cooper's mother told me? That when he was a kid, he had this doll, and he... he carried it around all the time, and he named her Ernesta. Ernesta? What? Something funny? I hate breaking up with patients. You shoulda seen... She just looked so hurt. And if she'd known that her husband had a thing for you, she'd be even more hurt, right? So you did her a favor, and you kept yourself out of harm's way. I wasn't going to do anything, Nai. I wasn't. - I am a professional. - Now it's not an issue. You know, I know that bars are not the best place to meet people, but... Your friend, he... didn't call. That's weird. Well. If he didn't call, he didn't call. You know, there are other oats in the sea, so... Except oats aren't in the sea. Let me buy you a drink, - help you forget about him. - You know what? I think he's gonna do that for me, so... - No hot date tonight? - Ask me in a couple of hours. - I'm surprised to see you here. - I thought you might be exploring that situation we talked about earlier. That was him this afternoon? You neglected to tell me that his wife was your patient. I'm not going there, period. All right? I even dropped his wife as a patient. There you go. - You don't have to choose between them. - No, that's not what I'm... Can you excuse me? So... your friend not calling Nai doesn't seem to have slowed her down. He may not have called because I never gave him her number. - What? - I know it. Don't say anything. - You can't keep that to yourself. - She's got oats to sow with men who aren't me. I'm not here to fight, Heather. I just want to talk. I just don't want to lose her, okay? So... You say vacations and... holidays... It's not perfect, but let's just try to come up with a plan, okay? Come on. Open the door, please. I'm sorry about this afternoon. Just... The redhead from last night? What is wrong with you lately? You're suddenly after - anything that moves. - There's nothing wrong with me. - I'm just having some fun. - Please tell me there's coffee. - I'm on it. - Where's Dell? I need him to prep a patient till my head clears. He's not in yet. That bad? I had four scotches, I was out dancing until 4:00 in the morning. My words were still slurring when I told... Adam? That it was not gonna work. Picking up people in bars is a bad idea. See, you say that, and yet you both got drunk and had sex last night, whereas I went home alone. Excuse me. Only I did not have sex. I went in a cab and then I went home and went to sleep. - Sleep is overrated. - Again? - The groupie from the basketball court? - Redhead. You do... realize you're not a teenager, right? You're a grown man with a potential child, and you're gonna see the ultrasound. So is this the example you're gonna set? If the ultrasound is such a big deal, we don't have to do it. You hound me for two months, and now it's not a big deal? I'm here for the ultrasound. That's great. That's great. I thought... that we could talk first. And... then we'll get to see my little peanut? And hey, no hard feelings about yesterday. She's moving like mad today. Violet lied to get Katie back in here? Can I talk to you? You shouldn't be here, Noah. I am coming to you as a doctor. Because I did my homework. You're the best neonatal specialist on the west coast, - and I want the best for my wife. - Maybe what's best for your wife - is to not have a doctor who you're... - In love with? But you don't feel the same way about me. And if you don't feel the same way about me, then you can be her doctor. And I can... keep my feelings in check. I can look at you and not think about it. I care about her. I don't want to hurt her. I can... be professional about this - if you can. - I can be professional, - I just think that there are other doctors... - but not as good as you. Please. Don't think about me. Think about Morgan. All right? She can't lose another baby, not again. Don't think about me. I woke up this morning, and the pain was worse. I'm hoping that's because I know it's cancer, not because it's worse. All the tests that we ran yesterday, they can aggravate the area. I know this isn't where you wanted to be, back figuring out treatments. I can handle the chemo and radiation. I'm so worried about Lyla. She feels so awful, you know? Let's just... focus on you right now. Oh, my God. What's happening? Oh, my God. Sam's stopping the bleeding. Come on. He's gonna be okay. I should never have let him go to your office alone. I should've known better. Thank you for calling me. So... the tumor is up against the carotid artery. Now the surgeon is afraid that at the rate that the tumor is growing, that it willrode into the artery and cause a massive bleed. What does that mean? - Brandon needs surgery very quickly. - What about the chemo? Resecting the tumor is our only option. We're gonna have to remove a portion of his jaw... He doesn't want surgery. I'm sorry. Maybe we've been focusing too much on the baby and not enough on everything that allowed you to get to this point. It's hard to separate me from her, but... - okay, I'll try. - Great. - Maybe start with your mom. - When she died, it was... It was like a pit opened up. And... that's when everything started. I was so convinced they killed her, the doctors. - But now you know? - That was crazy. I thought someone was plotting to steal her casket. I went to the cemetery to guard it. - But was that your fault? - No... But... Oh, God. Why are we going... Why are we going here again? We... got through this. We... got past this a long time ago. Right, but not everyone does. Not everyone fights to get their life back the way you did. - It's impressive. - And now the baby... Regardless of the baby, Katie, you... you've done amazing things. You finished school, you have a great job... - did... I say something that upset you? - No. I'm gonna be sick. You're burning up. Could you get Addison? Now. - What happened? - She's showing early signs of sepsis. I gave her antibiotics, but we need to do a D&C. What is it? What's happening? I know this is not what you want to hear, but what happened yesterday was not a mistake. Your baby died, and it's making you very, very sick. It's... morning sickness. We could go back to your office. You could make me feel better. I wish we could. But what Violet is telling you is what's really happening. And we need to remove the fetal tissue now. Listen to me! My baby's fine. You don't have my permission You can't do anything to me. - I want to get outta here. - Wait... It's all right... Let me talk to them. I'll straighten it out, okay? Look, she's pale, she's got a fever. If we don't get that tissue out soon, she could die. We cannot do this procedure against her will. You can. You can declare her incompetent. She's unable to make medical decisions for herself. If we force this on her, if we take out what she believes is a live baby, she will never recover. It will break her. Look, she needs a D&C. I get it. But I have to get her to accept that her baby is dead before you do it. You've tried. She can't accept it. If you don't want to force this, you don't have to. Pete and I can declare this an emergent situation. We'll override her. You mean override me. This is my call. I'll get through to her. - What happened? - I can't do this. He's gonna have half of his jaw removed. And... maybe it's horrible, but I'm just supposed to be okay with that? Every time I look at him, knowing that I did this... - He does not blame you. - I blame me. He spent his entire life trying to get his face fixed, and then he meets me I get that you're hurting, but he loves you. Don't... say that, don't make me feel worse, because I know it's selfish, but I... You're scared, you're overwhelmed, and you want to run. I've been there. Bad things happen, you want to run. But... if you can stick it out with somebody that you love... It is hard to find. He needs you. I'm sorry. - Everything okay? You were late... - Not now, Naomi. - Did you go and talk to heather? - I don't want to talk about it. Dell, you can... I'm gonna say this calmly like you suggested. I'm here, and I'm going to do my job, But I don't want to talk about. What are you doing out here? My cancer patient, Brandon, has to have a portion of his jaw removed, and his girlfriend dumped him. She felt guilty for making him sick, so she dumped him. Sounds like she's a real prize. She's just a kid. I tried to convince her she was making a mistake... You got any ideas? Nothing you can say is gonna make someone do something - they don't want to do. - Brandon needs her. Brandon wants her. What brandon needs is surgery and to find a woman who's not gonna run out on him when the going gets tough. Focus on helping them see what they really need. Dot just give 'em what they ask for. - I know you're scared. - Of course I'm scared. Doctors trying to take my baby... it's a nightmare. That's... that's scary. That... really is. But I'm... I'm looking at you, and you don't look like you feel well. I don't. Do you think maybe it's more than the fear? - What do you mean? - I mean... I think maybe, deep down, you're scared because you do know something's wrong. And all of us, when we don't know what's wrong, we get scared. But I'm hoping the part of you that knows something's wrong can help me, because I want to help you feel better. I'm just protecting her, like you would protect your baby. You wouldn't let anyone take her. Oh, God! I trusted you and Pete. You don't think I should have her. - I think you'd make a great mom. - Get out! I am not gonna let anyone do anything to my baby. What a... day. So your... - married friend came back. - It was purely a professional visit. - He wants me to keep seeing his wife. - Purely professional? He may have some feelings for me, but, you know, he's willing to put those aside. I'm sure you know what that's like... putting your feelings aside. - I'll play. What? - What? You want Violet to let you in, you want her to do the ultrasound, and you're out there sleeping around? What's going on with you? What good does it do to come face-to- face with something you can't have? - Even though there's a baby involved? - A baby that might not be mine. You're right. It might not be, but maybe it is. So I should get invested now and then have her take all that away? So you're putting your feelings aside? What... where is Katie? She's... still in the birthing suite. She needs some space, so i... I'm afraid I'm not gonna get through. She's in there staring at my belly. I represent everything she wants, and she hates me for it. She doesn't hate you. She just wants something she can't have, and that's hard. You're okay? This little girl... I hope she has brown hair, like me. - You know, let me call Addison. - No, don't. Is your daughter here? You said you have a daughter. Is she here? This was supposed to be a good day. I was supposed to see her, my daughter, but... but they wouldn't let me. What? I've had a crappy day, too. I went to my daughter's apartment to talk to her mom. They were gone. Moved out. Her mother took her away. I've been making calls and trying to figure out what to do, but the thing is, I don't think I can get her back. I'm so sorry. I know what it's like to want to believe that it's gonna work out. But sometimes you need to face the truth. Your baby's gone. And she's not coming back no matter how much you want to believe it. I... love her so much. It... scares me. I think... I think maybe that's why my stomach hurts so much. I know you love her. But the pain in your stomach is real. You know Dell is right, don't you? She didn't survive. You're gonna be okay. So will you. Dr. Pape said that you... didn't schedule your surgery. Lyla can't take it. She can't take it if the H.P.V. makes me lose half my face. I need to try chemo. I can't. I'm not gonna go back. I'm not gonna be the freak again. - She's the one. - She's not the one. If lyla was the one, she would not walk away. - There'll be other women. - Without a jaw? Without the surgery... You're gonna die. I don't want that life again. I don't want to be that guy again... So afraid of what everyone might think that I can't even string a sentence together. - Can't you find another way? - The way is surgery. It will save your life. And we can't do any better than that. I just... - I just wanted it so badly. - I know. I think it's a little lower. I'm sorry. It's... It's a boy. How do I look? Look good? Hot? Slutty? - Definitely hot. - I'm having dinner with Bryce. See. Yeah, he called. I knew he would. - You've got Maya? - I have Maya. You go and you do your thing with the oats. - With the what? - The oats?! Sow my oats. - Thank you for calling him. - Sure. You know, you... look a little slutty. But maybe if you changed, just covered up the... in this area here, maybe... Slutty's good. For sowing oats, slutty is very good. I'm not trying to get a husband here. I'm just... I got it. You don't have to elaborate. Cool. Then you look very slutty. Thank you. What... - are you doing? - what the hell's it look like? - I'm painting her nails. - This isn't right - you two, together. - You begged me to be nice to her. You told me to stop calling her names. And I'm glad you're friends, and I'm glad you're both in my life. It's hard enough to find one good woman. I found two. - Then what's the problem? - My girlfriend life and my best-friend life are colliding in a womanly womanfest of nail polish and bonding. You know what? I'm gonna go... drink with guys. You... I will talk to you in the morning. And I will tie your shoes and make your lunch. We'll talk about babies and boys. And you I'll see... later at your place for sex... lots and lots of sex. - But for now, I'm just gonna go. - You're actually living? Oone woman at a time is all I can handle. One woman at a time.
