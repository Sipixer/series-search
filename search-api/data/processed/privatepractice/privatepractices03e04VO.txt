Amazing, right? The thrill, the high. - I felt invincible. - The scalpel in your hand... - nothing beats it, not sex, not... - No, sex beats it. I wouldn't know, Sam. It's been that long. It's bad down there. It's like some old western town... - I can't hear you. Please stop talking. - With tumbleweeds... I'm changing the subject. We still got to... make a decision about Naomi. If we're not gonna replace her, I think we should at least have a talk. About buying out her shares? I was thinking the same thing, and I came up with a figure. I was thinking about making the suggestion today. You know what? Even without adding someone, we could still have another surgeon at the practice. You. The nanny had a cold. I didn't want Lucas to get it. Not that bringing a baby to a medical practice is a great way to stave off germs, but I'll keep him out of the way. He'll be fine. Have a good day. Oh, it's you. We missed you around here. - You okay? - She cried and she held on to my leg, - and I hate it when she cries. - We are talking about Betsey, right? It's her first day at a new school. She's gonna be okay, right? I know I just got back to work, but do you mind if I take off early, check on her? Sure. Whatever you need. It's time. My contractions are a few minutes apart. I'm going into labor. Let's get you to a room. Welcome back. - He doesn't even look at me. - That is not true. It feels like you don't look at me. It's just... Ever since... The rape. It's okay to say it. Sometimes that can help. I think if you could work on saying it... I don't want to keep bringing it up. - She's... - You think if you don't bring it up, - I'm gonna forget it happened? - That's the thing. It's there. It happened. And if you're not able to deal with what Collette went through, then you and she aren't gonna be able to move forward together. I'll see you next week. Meet me by the elevators. I have to stop by the ladies room. - I took a home pregnancy test. - You're pregnant? That's... You guys have wanted that for so long. You're having feelings about telling Ty? No, it's just... I'm eight weeks. I don't know who I'm pregnant by... My husband... or the man who raped me. Private Practice S03E04 Pushing the limits</i> - She didn't even look at him. - Nothing? - She looked through him. - She's having a hard time. She's gonna come around. I have a patient who doesn't know if she's pregnant by her husband or the man who raped her. Since when did you start wearing ties to work? - What's the occasion? - No occasion. I wear ties. Occasion. It's volunteer clinic day at the shelter. And I've recruited Coop and Sam to come down there with me. So you didn't need me? - I just figured that... - I'm seeing patients. I am fine. Listen, by the way, since we're all here. There is something we need to discuss. Since we decided not to replace Naomi, we need to buy out her shares. - What do we need to do? - We each need to put in $50,000 to the practice, and then we'll be equal partners. - 50 grand? - Check okay? - Check is perfect. - I could do mine. Come on, guys. It's an investment in our future. - Sure, whatever you need. - It's fine. So if we can just get checks by the end of the day, I'll get all the paperwork rolling. I will write mine... right now. We have... tampons, condoms and a sample of birth control pills, so... We hitched here about a month ago from Portland. I tried out Seattle and Tacoma, but I realized, if you're gonna be homeless, you might as well be warm. You know, it would be great if... you and Elliot could get checkups more often. - There is medi-cal. - You... need documents and I.D. I could help you track down your documents. You know what? It's okay. We'll make it. How old are you? - 15. - And there's no one, no family? Well, I got a mom. She's out of the picture. If I wanted to keep my baby, I had to leave. But we're good. You know, I take care of us. It's been hard... but we're lucky. - You know, we have each other. - Sometimes... - Look, mom. - That's all that matters, huh? He's had a runny nose for weeks. I mean, I gave him cold medicine. - It just won't go away. - He's got a little fever. Let me just have our pediatrician take a look. This is... Coo... Dr. Freedman. And this is Elliot. He's 2. He's got a little runny nose and it feels like a fever. - Can I take a look at you? - Come on now. When we get done, you want to go to the park? Let me see here. - How long has he had this? - The rash? A few days, maybe. It's not something serious, is it? We should... probably get him back to the practice, do an E.K.G. Now. I was so sure it was time. It will be. You just... you just have to wait. - Your first patient back? - False alarm, though. I heard about Lucas, that he's yours. Congratulations. - Do you have a minute? - I need to get a CVS test done. There. See? Tiny aneurysms on his coronary arteries. Blood vessels to his heart are inflamed. So it's kawasaki syndrome. It explains the erythematous rash. So this kid's homeless with a heart condition. So we treat it with immunoglobulins. It could help, but it's not a definitive repair. But it's the first line of treatment, right? What? His mother can't even afford a place to live, and now she's gonna have a son that could continue to get sick. I'm worried. I would like to do more. - Like what? - I could fix it... A bypass procedure. I know you just did surgery... Wait, it was an amazing surgery. Yes, but there's a process. You can't just jump back into surgery overnight. The boy has a heart problem, a heart problem that you and I both know nobody else will touch because there's no money in it. - You're jumping the gun on this. - Maybe I am, but... I look at her, and she should be in school with Maya, and she's not. She's not. She's alone, and it's wrong. Can we run her social, get an address, try to try to call the mother? We don't know the situation. She may be a runaway. But she could've been abused or molested. We are not going to put her in danger, but she is a kid on the street, in over her head with a sick baby. Not everyone's rich with a perfect life. - What does that mean? - I don't... it just means we... - I don't know. - Let's find the mom. You guys... What? Why are we here? Did something... I'm... pregnant, ty. And... there's... You're pregnant? So I'm gonna be a father? This is great. This is what we wanted. I know it's been awful. I've been awful. But, it's like a new start, baby. We ran a paternity test. It turns out that you're not the... It's his? - I know this is awful. - How soon can we abort? Now she's not looking at me. Now she's not talking. Collette, what are you thinking? It's awful. I know it is. But... we've been trying for so long to have a baby. And this isn't how I imagined it could happen, but, - this could be our chance. - Our chance? You're thinking about having him? After that pig did... you r... after he raped you? There, I said it. He raped you! And you want him inside you for another nine months? Naomi asked me to come down upstairs for a consult. Do you mind watching Lucas? I'm sorry. I'm in the middle of a situation. That husband just found out his wife is pregnant by her rapist. - I'm way behind in patient notes. - You have time. Lucas will not be insulted if you do a little work while he's visiting. If Violet asks, I'm here to consult on a case for you. - What am I an excuse for? - So I can leave the baby with her. Come on. I have to do something. I figured if I brought Lucas to work, she'd be forced to see him, and maybe... I don't know that forcing her to bond with the baby - is gonna be such a good idea. - I don't expect a miracle, but maybe if she just got curious, something to remind her that she has a son with me. Am I crazy? Trust me. Chocolate cures almost everything. This place is nice. You've done well. It's nice. It's a little quiet. - Quiet's good. - Quiet is fine. Quiet is professional. But it's... I don't know, it's a little weird. Everyone's always holed up in their offices working, and I just kinda... I feel like... - They treat me like... - The boss? Exactly. - You're on my turf. - You have turf? Work is turf. You've got Violet. You've got Lucas. I'm out of the picture, and I'm dealing with it. But you being here at my work? That is not part of my program. I will ask you to leave, please. It's okay. I'll talk to you later. Turf? I'm fine. Just working my way through the grieving process. Denial never lasts very long with me. The anger does, but I'm past it. And frankly, I'm too busy with work to be depressed, and as far as acceptance goes... Well, screw acceptance. But really, I feel... fine. You want to eat some chocolate with me? Do you always stuff your feelings with food? Interesting. I found the mother... Danielle's mother. - That's... great. - I have got Sam and Violet's check. I can get yours, too, and get it in the account. - Right now? - It's for the practice, for our practice. - I need to get the checks by... - By the end of the day. Do you need until later in the week? A little later in the week? A little later in the week. What? What, Cooper? Not everyone has a $30-million trust fund. Forget it. That's a lot of tubes. Are they hurting him? No, the tubes aren't hurting him. That's how he gets his medicine. He's never stayed a night away from me. And if I'm not back at the shelter by 8:00... You can stay in there with him. We'll get you all set up. I'll speak to the nurses. We'll... see what the... meds do. I really think that surgery would be a better option. Not until the mom gets here. I called her... the mom. She is on her way. Am I an ass... a callous, oblivious ass? What exactly are we talking about here? - Cooper called you an ass? - He yelled at me about money. - That. - What? What? Nothing. It's just... you're a rich kid. You grew up with money. You never had to worry about it. The rest of us, it's not so easy. But we're all doctors. I mean, you backed me on this. Because it's what we need to do for the practice. And it just so happens that I could write the check. So I am an ass. You could be a little bit more sensitive. Kind of like, because you're this world-class surgeon, you don't see how telling me I can't operate on this kid might be cutting my legs from underneath me. - I didn't. - Well, you did. - What's going on right now? - Faucet drip was going on all night. - It was driving me bonkers. - You decided to tear up my bathroom? New marble counters, hardwood floors, recessed lighting. You swept me off my feet and dragged me here, but don't expect me to live in a manhole. Bulldozing my bathroom to avoid going to work and dealing with your problems is not cool. This is so not cool. What are you doing home so early, hangdog look? We're two peas in a pod. Now there's dry rot that's a mess. Receipts are on the table. You can write me a check. - For what? - To pay for all this. Damn it. You really should not have done this. No contractions, just like this morning. But I feel it. It's all right here, and she's due. My daughter? A week overdue. And I'm about to pick her up from school. It'll happen when it's supposed to. But what if something bad happens when I get home, like she ends up breeched or I have her in the tub and she drowns? - Your baby will be fine. - How can you be sure? My husband's not around. I have tons of questions I need answered. I paid for the midwife experience, and you haven't been around. Let's... let's go over some of your questions. You just left Lucas sitting there? - He hasn't cried. - But he's awake. Didn't you want to pick him up - and play with him? - I'm working. I'm at work, working. You're his mother. Charlotte is taking out her problems on my bathroom. She needs to be stopped. So I need to hide this here before I just can't let her destroy anything else. - Why are we staring at the floor? - I've been trying for weeks to get the blood out of the wood, and nothing works. I've tried every brand. That's my fifth bottle. So... if Charlotte was raped and ended up getting pregnant by her rapist and decided to keep the baby, that would be a deal breaker for you. Do not hypothetically rape my girlfriend. I don't. The couple, the woman that was raped, wants to keep her, - the rapist's baby. - She wants to keep the baby? That's just crazy, right? I think I'm gonna tell her it's crazy. I know it's not my job to make decisions for people, but, It's not fair. Pediatricians... you get to diagnose, you get to tell people what to do. I'm supposed to just sit back and - let people figure it out. - Help them figure it out. Right. The point is, it's wrong, right? Right. I think. Did you actually write Addison a check? Do you think it's working? Yeah, maybe a little. How could she look at this face and not melt? She's not looking. I'm... out of ideas. Was I not clear? I realize you're not a trained therapist, but I would think that a doctor such as yourself would understand boundaries. - This is my battle, not yours. - We're not battling, Sheldon. - Naomi's my friend... - No. My friend. I call Naomi. - What? - No, he gets the girl. He gets the baby. I get you. You're my friend. Now get off our floor. I'll... just... I'll see you later. Go ahead and go, okay? Just go. For the record, I may not be fully over the anger part. Maybe not. Wait. What are you doing here? - You look so thin. - I'm fine, mom. Wait. Who called her? - Who called her? Who... - Danielle, I called. I looked and I looked for you, but you were just gone. Oh, he's beautiful. He looks like you when you were a baby. Don't touch him. - You can come home now. I don't... - You brought her here? - How could you do that? - She... was trying to help. Help? She dragged me to an abortion clinic. And when I wouldn't do it, she said I had to give him up for adoption. - I don't want her here. - Danielle, please don't do this. - Fine. If she won't leave, then I will. - Please... Just stay... You told me so. - Let's just hope we find 'em, okay? - I'm sorry, about the money. I wasn't trying to be an ass, you know? And if you're not liquid, I could front you the money. It's not a problem. What? I don't want your money. And I really don't want to talk about it. - How long's he been like this? - Over an hour. It's fine. He's just... he's hungry. He always cries like this when he's hungry. We were just too loud inside. I was scared I was gonna get kicked out. Come on. Be a good boy, okay? I got some pudding from the hospital. I took it off the trays. - Do you think he'll take that? - Listen to me. If there's something wrong with him, pudding is not going to help. Can you let me check him? Let me... just check him, just real quick. That's a good boy. Call 9-1-1. Lay him here. Come on. Just stay with us, okay? He never came home. I haven't seen him since he left here. He's working through this. He doesn't understand why... - Why you would consider this. - I know. I love Ty. We were... summer camp counselors together. We were perfect, but... But I'm having a baby. And you really think that you're up to putting yourself through this? Maybe. What... you don't think I am? I know you want to have a child, but, do you understand what life is gonna be like, seeing that baby every day? Every time you see it, it's gonna be like a recording playing over and over in your mind. So you'll... remember lying there feeling helpless. You will remember him standing over you and touching you. You will remember... screaming your lungs out, screaming until you're hoarse, hoping and praying that somebody will come and find you. But nobody is coming. And then comes the unbearable pain. And then you feel yourself passing out, but before you do, you wonder if you'll ever wake up again, and part of you hopes that you never will. So all of that... All of that... will be staring at you every day. Do you really think that you can look at that? Oh my God... Oh my God... Oh my God... One of the aneurysms must have ruptured. This doesn't make any sense. That medicine that you gave me, you said it would work. We wanted it to work. The last thing we wanted to do, is put you and Elliot - through anything more than we had to. - But you... can fix him? There are a few things we could do for Elliot, one of which is bypass surgery. That's where we take a vein that goes around the damaged vessel. Or we could insert a stent. - What's a stent? - That's experimental in kids his age. We put a tiny tube in the vessel to keep it open. They both sound good. What am I supposed to do? Bypass surgery. It's the right treatment, he needs it, and I'll do it. - I'll do the surgery. - That sounds good. I trust you. You... Do the surgery. - Can I see Elliot? - Sure. I'll take you to him. I know what you're gonna say, but I couldn't stand there and watch that girl be so confused. I can do this surgery. It's your call. Thanks for seeing me. I just wanted to come by and say thank you. - For? - For talking sense into Collette. She scheduled an abortion for tomorrow. For tomorrow. She's sure? She is now. I don't know what you said to her... she wouldn't listen to me... but thank you. - Were you... looking for me? - Pete, actually. I just wanted to finish a conversation we were having. I had some final choice words for him. I'm sorry. Violet, I have a patient in labor again, and Betsey's waiting for me at school, and I can't find Pete, so can... can you just... Go ahead and... - help? - Here. Got him? No, you can't go into labor from burping. It was good to see you. Thank you for answering my page. He's getting prepped for surgery right now. Danielle could... barely take care of herself. I was always getting her out of trouble. She has a real knack for making mistakes. We all do. I know, but dragging hat poor boy around with no roof over their heads, no safe place, I just... I want better for my grandson. I can afford better. I have spoken to my attorney, and after the surgery, I'm gonna petition the court for custody. - He doesn't think there'll be a problem - Don't you? Taking Elliot away from her? She's a child. I'm the mother. I'm gonna say something to you which I've never said, to anyone before. And I apologize for how it sounds, but - You're an ass. - What? You're a good person, and you're right, you are a mother, but Danielle is a mother now, too. And I believe that you want what's best for your daughter, but sometimes, even when we mean well, we end up hurting people. I'm just saying, think about Danielle. Think about what Danielle thinks about you. Right now... I have to think for her, not about her. - You're not in labor. - I feel contractions. I was sure I lost my mucus plug. Maybe you should check it again. You just need to go home, Kimmie, and be patient. I can't, because it's gonna happen, and I'm gonna be there alone, and I'm not gonna know what to do. I'm staying here because I know. I don't care what you see on that monitor. I know this baby's coming today. I'm not leaving, Dell. I'm having my baby. You can't force her to come before she's ready. You can't read a book and know what's happening. I am trained. I am trained to tell you what to do. And I can't sit here and wait with you and babysit you until she comes. I'm not your babysitter. I'm your midwife. And you're not my only responsibility. If you can't be patient if you can't deal with waiting, are you really gonna be ready for her when she comes, when she's crying and begging you to stay, you've got a thousand other things you gotta do, like I've got a thousand things I've gotta do? You're not my only priority. You need to pull it together and be patient. Take your little book and go home and don't come back until it's really time! Good luck. You think I'm crazy for thinking I can do this? Are you serious? It doesn't matter what I think. You made your decision. Surgeons step up, Sam. They don't question. They don't doubt. They don't let other people decide for them what is right or what is wrong. Be a surgeon or don't be a surgeon, but don't do this. You need to do it. Don't waver. You told Danielle that you could do this. Now go. Thanks for watching him. By the way, you're on my turf now. Duly noted. Violet really doesn't look at him, does she? - It's hard to watch. - You could say that. I'm gonna hate myself for saying this... You need to come downstairs, and you need to hire him. You keep this baby up here, you're gonna push her further away. And even if you kept Lucas at home, seeing you every day, that's... that's putting failure in her face. - I'm not gonna run away just because... - I couldn't possibly. You've hired a great group of physicians who have the sum total personality of a hermit crab, present company excluded. And Pete likes you, you like Pete, and I can... learn. Besides, how much chocolate can you eat? Want a drink? It's water, but I'm imagining. An imaginary drink would be good. I yelled at a patient. I told a scared pregnant woman to go home and not to call me until the baby came, cause I was busy and I was thinking about Betsey and I didn't want to deal with her and I didn't want to do my job and... I scared a patient into doing something I don't think she really wants to do. I scared a pregnant woman into killing her fetus because I was raped, twice. Once actually, and then... And then the baby thing. - I'm sorry. - This was supposed to be my safe place, It was supposed to be the one thing I could still do well. You're here. You know, at least... you want to be here. You're trying to get better. You don't want to be here? I like my work. But right now... All I can think about is Betsey. She kept begging me to stay and she needed me and... and you told your patient what you want to tell Betsey? " be patient. Wait. I'll be there when you need me. " that's good advice. I don't know what you told your patient, but you are a good therapist. Dr. Freedman, you scared me. Please don't tell. I just got enough stuff for a week. - And then after a week, then what? - I'll collect cans or make change washing windows. Good. And then the month after that? And the year after that? I'm doing the best I can for Elliot. I'm sorry, but no, you are not. You have a child now. It's not about your mom and it's not about you anymore. It's about Elliot. And when you decided to have him, that meant putting everything else aside. Doing your best for Elliot means doing some hard stuff. It means growing up. It means asking for help. It means admitting to the people who love you... You're drowning. Went to the grocery store the other day... And he wanted cheese puffs. But I couldn't get them because I needed the money for the bus fare. Who can't buy their kid cheese puffs? You're hovering. I'm moral support. - So I'm 0-for-2. - With what? Danielle's mom wants to help Danielle by trying to get custody of Elliot. I tried to tell her to back off, and then I went to apologize for Cooper and only made matters worse. - Sam, you okay? - His vessels are so small. Damn it. I can't connect 'em. - BP is dropping, - Hand me the gerald forceps. If I could just keep the walls of the arteries apart. Damn it. I can't... I can't get the lumen open. Sam, do you want me to call somebody else in to take over? It is okay to step aside. I'm calling someone. You are not calling anybody. You are a guest in my OR now shut up! Thank you for saving his life. He's a tough little guy. He'll be fine. Ms. Palmer... Elliot's out of surgery, and it looks like he's gonna be okay. Good. Do you want to come with me to see him? Thank you for coming in. I know this is not your regular time, and... A therapist should be a facilitator. What my role is... what I believe my role is... is to help you decide what you want. Not to impose my views on you. When you were here, I crossed a line. You made me think. But I was talking about myself. I've had some things happen to me, but they should never, ever, impact my patients. I don't know what you said, but... this is all good. We're moving forward. If that's what you want, if that's what you both want, then that's good. I'm just afraid that I haven't given Collette the chance to think what she thinks, to feel what she feels. So I'm asking you both to wait a moment, to step back and talk about this. Just to think, just to be sure. Because there are some things that you can't take back, and this is one of those things. I'm scared. Everything you said... That's how I feel. But when you first came in, you were feeling other things, too... Joy... Hope. Let's put those things into words, too, so you can move forward, together. I hate this... That I couldn't protect you. I know. I know. But... What do you want to do? I am a pregnant woman. I am nine months pregnant. Look in the book... hormones out of whack, emotions all over the place, and so I'm freaked out. And you, the person who's supposed to be my support, question me whether I know what I'm ready for? I am ready for this. This is everything that I want. The only one that I'm worried about is you. You're right. I was out of line and unprofessional. I'm the one who needs to be more patient, and I'm sorry. I just peed myself. I hate being pregnant. God. What, this is funny? Pee is funny? It's not pee. Your water just broke. It's time. - Really, it's time? - Relax. I got you covered. All right? Charlotte, get your butt out here now. - You did not just say that to me. - I'm broke. - Broke? - I'm broke. I need 50 grand to buy out Naomi's shares. I don't have it. And I am humiliated that I don't have it. But you're my girlfriend. So you need to know about these things... - I guess. - You're a doctor. - How can you be broke? - Pediatricians make less money. I'm spoiled. I'm spoiled, and I like porn. I've paid way too much money for porn in my life, and I think fast cars are good and shiny electronics make me happy. I'm a 12-year-old boy, and I never planned for next week or next month. And now I have to deal with that. So could you go find something else to do besides tear up my bathroom and make me broker? I'm telling you... surgery. I forgot what it felt like to be a godlike, arrogant... ass. Funny. You're a funny, funny man. Sometimes an ass is good. - I shouldn't have doubted you. - I shouldn't have doubted myself, so we're even. Cheers. Can I come in? Don't worry. I'll be quick. I'm here to discuss the buy-in. Here's your check for 50 grand for Cooper and a blank check for me. Write in whatever number you need. I want in. You want to work here? Is there something in this besides alcohol? Stop looking at me like I've lost my scruples. I haven't. I believe in whole wellness, too. Whatever. Does Cooper know you're doing this? You let me take care of Cooper. I'm not in the mood to fight, Pete. I know I don't have a client, but... it's not fair, me throwing Lucas in your face. But if I stay here, I'm going to want to. So... I'm taking a job at pacific wellcare with Naomi. I'm sorry it's so hard for you. I am. He was supposed to wait for me to get better, not walk out. I just needed time, Cooper. That's all... time. So I thought to myself, well, I'll give him Lucas. I'll get myself together if I just had a little time. And I say this with love, but you did push him away. Of course I pushed him away. I needed some space. Not this amount of space. But, you know, what is it with people? You push 'em away, and they just don't get it. And you know what pisses me off the most is this stain remover? It is 40 bucks, and it is crap! It's gonna get better. When?
