Messes with your head,huh? So it was a revenge kiss. No,no,not intentionally,but then,uh,watching you get all swirly since then? It is kind of gratifying. I think we should stop kissing. I mean,come on. What are we,12? No,we definitely are not. Which is why. I. do not want to be just another notch in your acupuncture table. I want more. What do you say we just see how it goes. tonight? I can work with at. we. -were just talking about a case. -Uh,she needed a consult on the. locked in the,uh,dell vault,all right? Your patients are here. we're in the dell vault. Locked in the dell vault. who keeps sticking bananas in the refrigerator? I,um,that. that would be me. Bananas need the climate of the tropical equator. You never stick bananas in the refrigerator. Susan mccullough is on her way in. Hey,how'd she sound? I believe her exact words were,"you guys better not screw this up. " Blocking the toaster. Hello. Wow,okay. That toast needs to happen right now. Somebody really needs to get. -don't say it. -I wasn't. I wasn't going to say "laid. " so we're inducing susan today,right? Yes. It is very important to her that we follow her labor plan. That means pete's stress-reduction techniques,the birthing tub. Honestly,not a big fan of the tub. There are fluids in there. blood,uterine tissue,sometimes fecal matter. Okay,you made me think about it. Well,you know,I mean they're just big and wet and difficult to work with. I mean,the's a reason they don't use those things in hospitals. She's my patient,and we're gonna do it the way she wants. Well,I'm not really comfortable being a,uh,birth coach. That's not what I do. Really? Because. addison,susan was widowed few months into her pregnancy. Her husband jason was a cop. He was killed on duty. Oh,that's. she's had panic attacks,and that would be a problem during a birth. She doesn't have any other family,so she's on her own here. I promised her we'd take care of her. Okay. Okay,I'llave dell go ahead and prepare the bathtub. yeah. Hey,Dr. Bennett. It's sara hill. Hey,sara. How you doing? Is there any chance you could do a house call now? I kind of hurt my leg. I'm afraid it might get worse,a lot worse. Okay,I guess I can run over there and check you out. The address is 5600 alverson. And can you hurry? So you moved away from the marina,huh? alverson. hello? Okay,uh,I'm gonna need the lights dimmed,and we can put the birthing ball right here. Where's the music I asked for? I need the cd. Oh,I have it. Why don't you just relax? We'll get everything taken care of. Oh,I know. We've got a plan,and we're following it. But as we discussed,not everything is under our control. Babies often have plans of their own. I'm prepared for that,too. I wrote down all the contingencies. Dr. Montgomery,it's baby day. Hi,susan. Uh,as soon as pete does his relaxation therapy,then I will be back to. to administer the pitocin after you remove the prostaglandin insert. That's exactly right. Okay. So let's do this. Cooper! Hey,malcolm,you got a game today? I caught a fly in the toilet! You did? No way. Really? good work. Patrick,can you keep them kind of. doc,spider web,3:00. -How you holdin' up? -Hangin' in.

All right,team. Let's go. Come on. Okay,the baby's heartbeat looks good. Good. This is my fourth baby,so i should know the drill by now. Come on,mom,hurry up. I gotta go to the game. Todd,todd,todd,honey,not in here. Just a minute,and then we'll go. Ya ashley,you may be here longer than you think. You're in labor. You're having this baby now. you leaving? Yeah,sara hill wants me to drop by her place,a leg injury. Uh,what about your patients on the books? I moved some things around. I like getting air. I know going off schedule is something that's hard for you to grasp. I can grasp it just fine,thank you. -Oh,really? -Really. Go. Enjoy. -Where's he going? -House call. Whatever. Hey,you need to do something about pete. Does he know what he's doing with addison? What is he doing with addison? Oh,no. Did they? It's imminent. So none of my business. All right. It's none of my business either. Except pete already proved he shouldn't date at work. M-maybe addison decided to enjoy herself. Men do it all the time. Right,that's. that's fine. It's empowering for women,actually. casu sex. It can be,as long as the boundaries are clear. And I'm very,very good with boundaries,aren't I? Not really,no. But you're looking right through me,so I'm guessing you're not hearing a word I'm saying. So. 5600 alverson. This can't be right. Sara. ClOSED CERRADO It's him. Thanks for coming. Yeah. I'm so sorry. Uh,are you okay? Your leg. I-I didn't call you here for me. I-I called you here for him. sara,what's going on? it's my leg. What happened to you? She shot me. She. you shot him? Not her,me.

Jason wouldn't have wanted that. This should be about the baby. Can you just tell him I'm fine? He can go back to work. you okay? yeah. I just. feel a little anxious. He shouldn't be here. I didn't want to think about it. God. Remember the visualizations we worked on? Focus on those images. Okay? We're following the plan. Everything's right on schedule. I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

You and me. friends with benefits,tonight. I mean,you're right,you're right. I am. I'm stressed out,and I just. I just need some. touch. and you're perfect because unemotional sex is the only kind you have. And. What time should I come over? -Really? -Really. Oh,hey,cooper,can you take sam's 11:30? I gotta help with. I'm getting laid tonight. Congratulations. What's her screen name? No. Me and violet. What? Friends with benefits. her idea. No strings,no expectations,no downside.

I know susan doesn't want anybody in there, but she's part of our family,and we're not gonna leave one of our own alone. Guys coming off shift,uh,they want to they want to be here for her. Now I'm not comfortable with this whole birthing myself, but keith here,he's got two kids,another one on the way,so he's good to go in. I. I don't think susan is going to change her mind. But susan. she's. she's just a kid. Yeah,but she. she needs to do this her own way. All right. Well,uh,we'll wait here. We're staying. How do you feel? How do you think I feel?

Uh,just a minute. I'm here to monitor your contractions. All right. Uh,any questions or concerns? Anything I can do to help? Oh,no,no. I've. I've done three of these. I just say a little prayer and go,and you just sit there and catch the baby like it's a football,okay? can I just say,it's a good thing that pete is getting me now,because I am hot. I am on fuego. This place is crawling with cops. And that cute one over there,he's totally. what? Sam just called. He's delivering a baby. He is? What's with all the births today? It's like babypaloozA. God,how does he get himself into these things? I-I should just mind my own business,right? About sam? Yeah,about sam,and about you on fuego and pete. You all. you all just. leap. And you are a thinker. So. what do you think. about me and pete? Come on,nai. you're my friend. Okay. Fine. You said you want change and you pick pete? What,a cute doctor boy with nice eyes? That's not change. That's your M.O. You're just. you're rushing into something new. I'm not. I'M. making a decision,uh,to take a chance on something that feels right. Because you're afraid to be alone. So what if I am? Surprise,naomi. I'm susceptible to the human condition. I mean,look,there are other men. I mean,there are men in uniform that I can not be alone with right now. I did not pick pete because I'm desperate and lonely. Pete is my choice. You asked. Are you okay? The baby's coming now. What? No,um. are you sure? It's coming. U have to catch the baby. Okay. No,no,I-I can't do this. I have to call naomi. Now would be a good time! naomi! Susan,your contractions are five minutes apart. So. it won't be too much longer. I'm ready. You really are,susan. You are totally prepared for this. Oh,god. Today. My son's birthday is today. what are you doing? Timing your contractions. You been having pain long? Yeah,since I got up this morning. What were you thinking? I was thinking that I need to rob a convenience store because I have no money for diapers or food or to put a roof over my baby's head! -Okay,ma'am. -that's not a reason. Normal people don't hold up stores,kelly. Kelly? So you two didn't just meet today,did you? That's my baby you're delivering. okay,okay,okay. dell. it just. it just happened. I-I-I swear. It was the fastest delivery I've ever seen. Okay,it's all right. All right,dell. Okay,first what we're gonna do is we're gonna cut the umbilical cord. Yeah. All right,see? Right here. You see? -About a half an inch. -You got it? There we go. Yeah. Keep the baby low for me. There you go. All right. there you go. -How is she? -oh,she's great. She's great. She's,um,oh! She's. she's a boy. congratulations. It's a. it's a boy. No! You shove that boy back up there and pull out a girl!  one girl. Is that too much to ask? Well,uh,your. your ultrasound was quite a while ago ,and,uh,misinterpretations can happen that early on in the pregnancy. I bought a little pink dress with some little pink shoes for a little pink girl. And I'm not leaving until I get some pinkness! all right,kelly,I need you to take slow,deep breaths. Babies take money,damon. What,you think I wasn't gonna turn you into the police? What,you think I was just gonna let you rob the place where I work and not turn you in? You owe me. you're crazy! I'm not crazy. I'm hormonal. Tell him I'm hormonal. Uh,I think that maybe there's a new word for what you are. I couldn't raise this baby on my own. You wouldn't give me any money,so I had to come and take it. You left me with nothing. Why do you think I took this job in the first place? I told you,I'm gonna take care of this baby. But you left me. Yes. I left you. But I won't leave our baby. Let me help. I have. I have to just say,it sounds like damon's an okay guy. So,you know,maybe you should let. stay back! Stay back! Okay,everybody,stoP. just stop. We are going to listen to the lady with the gun. I can't take it. Does everybody understand? keep taking those long,slow,deep breaths,okay? there we go. Ashley minnehan will not bond with this baby. She won't even look at him. She was expecting a girl. She's hormonal,so she's at risk for postpartum depression. -Can you talk to her? -Sure. Let me just make sure susan's ready for me to go. Okay. -My place,8:00. -Done. I can't raise four boys on my own. Well,have you,uh. you have your husband. He can help. Oh,yeah,sure. Yesterday he taught the boys how to burp the national anthem. Not the right kind of help. I'm the only one who puts batteries in the smoke alarm,the one who puts the cover on the swimming pool at night. Have you tried talking to patrick? Oh,he says I'm just being silly because nothing bad ever happens. But that's only because I make sure nothing bad ever happens. Ashley. you are a great mom. the boys likhim better than me because he plays with them. I just wanted one girl so she could be mine. And then I wouldn't care so much about having to do it all myself. Well,maybe you have another boy for a reason. Maybe it's because you're a great mom,and you're going to raise your boys to be good men. And the world needs good men. I want a girl. I've been kind of a pain in the ass. No,you haven'T. Yes,I have. all my rules. but things work out better when I stay focused,don't let my mind wander. You have nothing to apologize for. you can't really. I mean. there's no plan for doing this alone,is there? Look,there's a roomful of jason's friends from the force here for you. You could bring someone in. They don't get how lonely it is since he died. Probably not. I lost my wife a while ago. I'm sorry. It gets better. Does it really get better? Or do you just bury it deeper? I don't know. Maybe it depends on how you left things. They were good. He was so excited about this baby. Hold on to that. Oh,here comes another one. Stand up? Okay. -You're doing good. -Breathe. that's it. That's it. That's good. Just like that,kelly. Oh,god. Uh,you may be fully dilated. Here you go. Is the baby okay? Please make it stop. Make it stop,Dr. Phil. Well,not. it's not phil. It's feel,like "feel good. " Okay,never mind. I want an epidural. Oh,please. Epi. yeah,well,we're in a convenience store so. oh,god. She's in pain. Do something. all right,all right. Kelly,listen to me. your mind is a very powerful healing tool. So if you can relax your mind,you'll be able to relax your body. All right? You understand what I'm saying? So try to relax your mind. I just wanted a home to raise my baby in,and now I've ruined everything,and you're telling me to relax my mind! Okay,good. You're ready to start pushing. Nice and easy. I dropped it. I dropped the list. Well,it's all right. We know what to do. No,I. you know,I should've laminated it. Why didn't I think of that? We don't need it,susan. I need it. I need to get outta here. I need it. Whoa,whoa,susan,stay where you are. Just grab on to the handles if you need support. Try to relax. Relax. No,I can'T. -I can't push. -Yes,you can. Susan,the baby's coming. No,something's wrong. I can feel it. Nothing is wrong,susan. You're doing great. Where the hell is jason? -You're in control. -No! Just stay with it. He's supposed to be here! He's. where is he? okay,susan. Susan,this little baby is ready to come right now. We are ready,just like you planned. No,no. He's. Oh,my god. -Try to breathe. -My jason. my. oh,he's dead. Oh,he's dead! He's dead. He's really dead. Okay,susan,susan,when you hyperventilate,you lower the baby's heart rate. All right,if we don't start pushing right now,there's a chance you will lose the baby. Do you understand? I can'T. I can'T. I didn't want to be alone. Oh,this wasn't my choice. No! I chose jason! I didn't want this. Susan,honey,listen to me. You're not alone. Okay? I am right here with you. Okay? Now. you're not alone,and we're gonna push. Keep breathing. Push. good girl. Good,good. Good. Good. You're dng great. Now let's bring your son out here,okay? All right. Ready. oh,god. Please,please,please,please,please. Oh,god. -I can help. -You stay back. You want to kill me,then kill me. No,no,no,no,no,no. We don't have to go there. We don't have to go there. I'm not gonna leave our baby. Hey,hey,hey,man. S-sit down,sit down. Kelly. I got news for you. You tried to rob a convenience store today. When this is all done,you're gonna have to answer to the cops. And they're probably gonna try and take your baby away from you. But I think that,uh,that maybe you're lucky because. your baby's father,he really wants to take care of your child. No,he left me. Okay,if you want what's best for your baby,you gotta put down that gun. I can'T. You'll call the cops. I'm not gonna call the cops. You're gonna have to trust me. Can you trust me? All right,then put down the gun. okay,now,uh,let's get this baby out. -You didn't call the cops. -Nope. I didn't call the cops. All right. time to see my new boy? How awesome is that? Another little dude. He's. he's with the nurse right now,getting cleaned up. Is something wrong? You need to grow up. I'm sorry? -You don't. -patrick,he,uh,he's right. Um,you need to help out around the house. I help. I hang with the boys. Upside down,out windows. that's not any help. Honey. Ashley really needs you to not play so much,do more parenting. You know what? You need to grow up,too. Me? What did I do? You knew going in that the odds of having a girl were 50-50. You decided to populate,and that boy is yours. You get what you get,and you don't get upset. Or,if you'd like,I can introduce you to one of the many families I treat who can't even have a child. All right? All right. I'm sorry. Are you two ready to see that beautiful baby boy I delivered? We're ready. That's good. That's real good,kelly. That'S. what? What is it? Uh,okay. You just hang tight,kelly. Hang tight.
