So pete's been helping youwith your holistic birth plan? Yeah,he's been great. I wantto do everything natural,but daniel wants to knowthe sex. I want a girl. Love boys,but I want a little laura. this may bea little bit cold. sorry. I'll turn this off. You can take it,honey. He still working too hard? Yeah,daniel's always working. And he travels a lot,but he's tried to cut downsince the baby. It's not easy. We just boughta house in the valley. -And babies are expensive. -Exactly. But whenever he's away,he always sends flowers. Roses for meand daisies for the baby. That's the baby's name--daisy--which is whyit needs to be a girl. A boy named daisy? daniel,you're just in time. Here we go. See,there's a little arm... and a lile hand. Oh,my god. That's our baby. So is it a boyor a girl? Looks like... a little girl. what's wrong? There was a subtle abnormalityon your baby's ultrasoundthat may indicatedigeorge syndrome. It's a genetic disorderthat can... cause heart defects. So if our baby has it,one of us gave it to her? -Technically,yes,but--sometimes these thingsjust happen. We don't always know why. -Danny--now we haven't madea definitive diagnosis, so let's just take ita step at a timeand not jumpto any conclusions. Let's get you downto the lab. Franny,please,please take the pills. Henry,good to see you. It's beeway too long. I'm sorry I keep cancelingmy appointments. It--it gets harderand harder to get away. That's okay. I understand. Frances... you look lovely today. She doesn'tremember much anymore. Well,alzheimer'scan be very unforgiving. -Hello. -Oh,the other dr.Bennett. Hello,frances. Helen,is that you? Helen was her sister. She passed away a few years ago. I don't need those pills. Helen,you tl himI don't need those. Of course you don't,ranny,but why don't you take them? Let's just humor him,okay? She's got the magic touch,your wife. okay,let's--let's get you started. Come on,franny. Want to stay with helen. That's okay,you go ahead. Uh,franny and I have a--a lot to talk about. How you doing today,miss lady? -I'm okay. -Yeah? Well,you look beautiful. it's loud. It's loud in here,very loud. Louder in here,quieter in the exam rooms-- it's good for business,betterthan the other way around. So I put a rush on danieland laura's lab results. You should have somethingby noon,and you have a new patientat 11:00. -Thank you. -I'd like to ask... I'd like an officeso I could meet with patientsand finish my midwife hours. Well,give me some time. I'll see what I cancome up with. The thing is,I'd like it now. -Dell,I wish we hadthe space,but--actually,um,I made space. I'll get rid of the boxes. We will get you an office,dell,a proper one. I need an office now,today. All right,if you have clientsyou need to see today,you may use my office. We will work this out,dell. I don't like this. You lost weight,you're anemic,your blood pressure'sway too high. Thiss serious. I took all of the pillsyou gave me. They'll kick in soon enough. You can't go on like this. -Now I know that thingsare difficult with frances--every day... I losea little bit more of her. She hasn't been lucidin over a year. You know,there are other waysyou can look after francesand take care of yourself. Oh,no,sam. I told you. I'm not gonna put herin a nursing home. I promised herthat I wouldn't years ago. We promised each other. Circumstanceswere different then. -You didn't knowabout the alzheimer'S. -Sam,I promised her. When she dies,she dies in my arms--not with strangers,in my arms. She's the love of my life. I will not putthe love of my life... in a home. -no,addison,wait. -Hi,there. Thank you for seeing usso last minute. Daniel pulled me out of class. He said we had to havean ultrasound today. I was tryingto warn you. I have an O.B.,But daniel saidyou were the best. -Uh,I'm sorry.Uh,miss- -this is amy,my wife. You have two wives? -He has two wives. Did you know that? -No. -Daniel--I didn't planfor this to happen. I've been happily marriedto amy for 12 years. But then three years ago,I met laura. E fell in love. -Do they know about each other? -Please. You can't say anything. It's a pretty dumb move... bringing two wivesto the same medical practice. When you foundthe abnormality,I worried amy's doctorshad missed something. Amy's due date'sright around the corner. I couldn't risk somethinggoing wrong with her delivery,with our baby. I should throw you out of here. I should,but I won'T. I'll go aheaand do the ultrasoundbecause your wife--that wife--and her unborn childare the victims here. I'm doing it for them,not you. Let me be clear about that. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Proudly Presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Sync:YTET-Âí´óÅÝ</font> private.practice. Season 2 Episode 6</font> So,amy,you're a teacher? Third grade. I love kids. I always have. We want a big family. And it looks likeyou're well on your way. Everything's okay? You see that flickeringright there? That isyour baby's heartbeat. -It's so fast. -That's normal. Your baby isperfectly healthy. Thank you,dr.Montgomer thank you. You're welcome. Amy. You told themabout charlotte. I didn'T. I didn'T. They guessed. And what do you care? You're the one who walked outof the bar with cruella. My relationship with charlotteis mine,not yours,to shareor mock or... call cruella. You're the one who outedyour relationship. You don't have a rightto be mad at me. I'm sorry. I had a few too many drinksand I did a spontaneous thing, and now everybodyknows about it,and that'S... it makes it real. It's very,very... very real. Well,real is a good thing,right? Yeah,I guess. Okay,look... it's truethat I don't like cruella--charlotte-- but that doesn't mean... coop,you shouldn'tbe afraid to hope,to want it to work out. Hoping is healthy. Real is a good thing? Real's a good thing. we are trying to workup here! That'll help. It's disrupting the workplace. I want to know who's behind it. Addison can't figure it out. I'm gonna do it myself. You want to help me? I wish I could,nancy drew,but I have children to heal. Fine,fine. M gonna find out. -hey,sam. -Yeah. I am thinking we should hita bar tonight after work... Try again. There are so manybeautiful women in L. A. Pete,naomi and I,we just came outof a long-term relationship. I don't knowif I'm ready to-- sam,cooper is dating. Well,cooper is datingthe antichrist. Well,at least he's dating. You gotta get back out there. I am making it my missionto get you a date. -we were just--we have to go to the hospital. Frances just had an accint. I was helping herout of the tub,and she fell and hit her head,and I-I tried to catch her. Relax,relax. All right,your blood pressure's highand your pulse is irregular. How's franny? Everything looks good,but,uh,we'll--we'll talk tothe attending before we go. Helen... please take me home. I want to go home. We're gonna get you homeas soon as possible. This situationis getting dangerousfor the both of you. Oh,don't start with meagain,sam. Did they do a C.T.Scanbefore diagnosing herwith alzheimer's? Her doctor saidshe didn't need another test. Is there something wrong? Everything's fine,henry. It's fine. Is the husband here? Oh,the husband just leftwith the other wife. -laura,hi.I'm dr.Freedman. -Hi. Laura... the baby tested positivefor digeorge syndrome. here is some informationyouunderstand the disorder,and we can go overall of it with you. Will she... will she survive? She'll survive delivery,but life... for a childwith digeorge syndromeis... difficult. Digeorge syndromeis a genetic disorder,and facial abnormalities. She's gonna require surgery--a number of surgeries. And she'll need a lifetimeof medical treatmentwith round-the-clock care. What am I supposed to do,dr. Wilder? Parents in your situation--about half of themdecide to throughwith the pregnancy. -The other half de--oh,god. No. End the pregnancy? We tried for so longto get pregnant. It took almost a year. I... I just... I'm not ready--I'm not ready to hear this. I need my husband here. ***For all this drillingand banging? I try to avoid manual labor,but I am leasing the space. For what? I'm openinga new medical practice. You're opening a practice here? What about cooper? -This has nothingto do with him. -He's your riend. This is business,and cooper is personal. -It's not that simple. -Maybe not for you,but I am not a therapist. I don't have totalk about my feelingsuntil everyone else's earsbleed. -You need to tell him. -I don't need to do anything. If you don't do it,then I will. Fine. I'll tell him. It's disgusting. It's disgusting and cruel. I mean,he is usingthese two women. --We have to tell them. What our patients dooutside this practiceis none of our business. Oh,come on,pete. It's illegal. I'm not saying I like it. I'm saying we don't havethe right to say anythingto either of these women. But if laura does decideto have this child,she's doing sounder the mistaken beliefthat she has a loyaland committed husbandto share the burdenwith her. I don't condonedaniel's bavior. but the factthat he's married to two womendoesn't mean that he's notcommitted to staying loyalto both of themand the children. He is a liar,and he shouldn't--you know... he doesn't deserve to raisethose children. That's an emotional response,not a medical one. He's their father. -So that gives him a free passto do whatever he wants? -You can't say anything. Don't you even thinkabout saying a wordto either of those women, or I will personally report youto the A.M.A. -Are you threatening me? -Don't say a word. Fine. I won't say a word. Didn't we talk about this? we did. -Look,I can make it work. -Why is this so urgent,dell? Okay,you don't want to talkabout it. I still don't want youusing this space. I need you to get laura larsonand amy larsonback in here again todayat theame time. Okay. listen,uh,about peteand this dating thing-- I think francesmight not have alzheimer'S. "Normal pressurehydrocephalus"? Yeah,her C.T.Scan showedno evidence of acute trauma. But there was marked dilatationin the ventricles. Now N.P.H.And alzheimer'shave similar symptoms. Okay,but what differencedoes it make? Her body is too frailfor her to be a candidatefor a neurosurgical procedure. Yeah,but there was a studythat was doneabout ten years agoin which a spinal tapwas performedto drain the excess fluidoff of patients with N.P.H. Now if she has this,the tapcould relieve the symptomsand give hera few brief periods of clarity. -Well,that's a big if,naomi. -It's worth a try. The only blessingof this disease is thatshe's not cognizant enough tounderstand her own situation. Do you want her to understandhow bad things are? I nt her to understandhow bad things are for henry. So then you'd put her througha spinal tap? If--if this were me,if this were you and me- -this is not you and me. -I know that. Well,this isa shot in the dark,naomi. The frances I knewwould not have wanted thisfor either of them, and she's the only onewho can convince henryto do what he needs to do. hey,uh,laura larsonand amy larson are here. Put amy in exam room four. Which exam room do you wantto put laura in? Let me worry about laura. Is theresomething else wrong? No. Uh,no. No,no. I-I... I just wantto make sure that you haveall the informationthat you need. Uh,the room's taken. I'm so sorry. Dell must havemade a mistake. Um,do the two of you mindhanging out in here for a momentwhile I clear this up? That's fine. Two new moms. I'm sureyou've got a lot to talk about. -What did you do? -Nothing. -What did you do? -I did not say a word. just get away from me! I've got to get out of here! What did you do? I didn't say a word. You got around itby a legal technicality. Exactly,because they hadthe right to know. Whether they did or not,you had rightto orchestrate that. I did what I would wantsomeone to do for me,pete. You overstepped. What is wrong with you today? do you have any ideawhat you just did? How long did you thinkyou could keep up this charade? What part of my lifeare you calling a charade? Take it easy. I've been with amysince I was 21. She's the woman I've beenhappily married to for 12 years. So happily that you went outlooking for other women? I never stopped loving amy,but when I met laura,it was... I--have you ever met someoneand just knownthere was something between you you couldn't resist,even if you tried? I could have been one ofthose guys with a wife at homeand a girlfriend on the side, but I married them bothbecause I wanted to dothe right thing. You're living a lie,daniel. You're cheating on two women,and cheating ruins lives. I'm not the onewho ruined lives here today. Um,as the kids would say,drama. Addison's patients?I think it's so sad. Sad but weird. Sad but fodder for the bestdinner party story ever. Addison has--she's gone crazy and... I love it! why the cold shoulder? I'm not--I'm not giving youthe cold shoulder. I'm just--I'm--I'm distracted. I know what this is about. You do? It's charlotte. I should have told youbefore I outed us. I'm sorry. you can't walk out.It's your office. he was nevergonna say anything. He had these women thinking thathe's one thing,but he's not. And the worse part is... he only felt badbecause he'd been exposed,not because of what he'd done. you don't look surprised. Well,people lie.It's human nature. And you're okay with that? Do you know how many guyon the forcehave something on the side? I should know.I'm their alibihalf the time. And you cover for them whilethey're out having affairs? -These guysare like my brothers. -What about their wivesback home, -just too bad for them? -I'm not encouraging it,addison. I'm just saying it happe. Yeah,well,maybe it shouldn't happen. You want to talk aboutlast night? What about last night? I gotta go.It's a work thing. We'll talk later,okay? uh,I just talked to henry,and he's agreed to dothe spinal tap. Oh,all right. Well,at leastyou got what you wanted. Look,sam,I know you don'tagree with me on this one-- you're right.I don'T.All right? You're putting francesat risk. For henry,f frances. I hope it is for them... and not for you. -hey,addison. -I think I may have justgone too far. With what? I followed kevin. What do--what do you mean,you followed him? At first it was justa routine surveillance. You are not a cop. I followed him to work,to the precinct,which is apparentlywhere I should've stopped. Oh,god.Where--whereare you now,crazy woman? I'm not insane.I went to the precinct. Five minutes later,he comes roaring outof the parking garagein another car,a van. Did it--did it not occur to youthat he might be working? Of course he could be working. Only maybe he's not working. People lie,I. They lie and they cheatand they ruin people's lives, and I am not gonna be one ofthose women who gets duped. Addison--addison,you needto be careful. or maybe he's working. -Addison? -I gotta go. get out of the car! I'm sorry. I-is there--keep your handswhere I can see themand step outof the vehicle now! No,no,no,no.I'm not partof any of this,though. Step out of the vehicle now. Open the doorfrom the outside. Turn around. What? Wh--oh! Oh,not handcuffs.You can't be serious. Who were youon the phone with? Oh,no.I was talkingto my friend. Were you calling someoneinside that building? No,no,no,no.I'm a doctor. I'm--I'm a surgeon. -I can show-- -whoever you are,you're obstructing justice. -No,I can show you-- -addison? Hey,kev. you were spying on me? Not spying. Okay,yes,spying. You want to tell mewhat's going on? I just... I spent all day dealing witha seemingly normal guy who's the liarof all liars,so... I checked your blackberrybefore you left. You did what? Yes,and I sawthe missed calls from leslie,and I wanted to seewho she was. Well,you already have. Officer leslie davis. And I wouldn't call him "she"to his face. Oh. Why are you lookingfor reasons not to trust me? Fine. -kev-- -get out. Kevin... just...just go. cooper the internet dateris in a healthy relationship, and my too-good-to-be-trueboyfriendthinks I'm a psychoticbunny boiler. He'll come around. I screwed up. I mean,he said what he saidand I... lost my mind. Addison,amy and lauraare here. -Why? -I called them. Why'd you bring us here? I thought you should talk. I don't want to talkabout this. I was up all night.I felt sick to my stomach. I feel likethis is my fault somehow. I-I should've known. Neither of youdid anything wrong. You trusted the person you love. Th's the normal thing to do. Pete's right. Daniel is the only person herewho's done anything wrong. Bastard. Look,you've both been burned,but maybe there's a waythat you can help each other. I don't want help from her. -Pete,we shouldn't-- -we should. You share a common bond. Your childrenare going to be siblings. Each of you understandswhat the other one is feelingbetter than anyone else. I feel lost. Daniel was... my one constant,the only thing I couldalways depend on. We should've made this decisionabout our baby together. I don't knowif I can do this by myself. No,no. I-I don't know her,and I don't want to know her. Look,amy,you're bothhurting right now, but maybe there's a chanceyou can help each otherwork through this. Damn it! I think... I-I thinkmy water broke. How much longer? just another minute. I promise. Thank you,helen. How do you feel,frances? What? Are you... where's the music? I thought there wassupposed to be music. She's gonna be fine. The worst isver. No,look at her.I nevershould've put her through this. This may work,henry,and it could give you... at least something. If only I can talk with her,even for a minute, look into her eyesand know that she sees me,really sees me. Okay,amy... you're about8 centimeters dilated.How are you feeling? Daniel was supposedto be here. If you want me to,I'll call him. I don't want to see him. but I don't wantto be alone. you haven't told cooperthe truth yet. You're not very good atletting things go,are you? You know what I think? I think you're scared. Of what? I think this relationshipis getting real, so you're just as scaredas cooper is. So you're tryingto sabotage it. Take a new job,rent the floor under him,keep it from him-- you want thisto blow up in your face. You know what I think? I think you're nothalf the shrinkyou think you are. Where are you going? To tell cooper the truth. Why isn't she responding? We knew we could only try,henry. Frances... remember theay last november,we were at home? It was raining and cold. You were reading in your chair. I saw you shivering,and I asked you if you wanted meto turn the heat up. And you smiled,and you said yes. So I went downstairsand turned the thermostat up. And when I came back up,I told you I-I hadone it. But you didn't know me. That was the last timewe spoke. Please don't let that beour last memory together. We need a new memory. This is too hard for him. Frances,it's me... helen. Your husband is hereand he needs your help. You--you need to do thisfor him. I'm sorry,henry. I'm so sorry there wasn't morethat we could do for her. I understand. Henry. Henry... -where am I? -You're here now. That's what's important. You look so beautiful. You look so tired. I've missed you. I've missed you every day. Frances,henry promised youthat he would never put youin a nursing home. I'm sick,aren't I? Yeah. You'll visit me every day. You'll come see me every dayand hold my hand. You promise me that? -But,franny-- -you promise me that,henry. And then... you let me go. Promise me,my love. I promise. Okay,amy,on three,I'm gonnaneed you to push,all right? Ready?One,two,three. Push. good.That's good.Good. Now take a breath. I hate him! Concentrateon your baby.

Okay,when I say push again,you're gonna push,amy,all right? -And ready? -You can do this. no. Push. we need to talk. Thank god. What--what do you mean,thank god? I mean something's beenbothering you. You haven't been yourself. Okay,I feel like you thinkthat because I'm with charlotteand things are going well that I'm not gonnabe there for you, but I--I'm here for you,violet. And the fact that charlotteand I are greatdoesn't change that. Okay? Let's talk. Oh,okay. I've... just... you know what?You just said it. I-I think I was worriedabout you and charlotteand what that meant,but... I just wantto see you happy,coop. it'sa wonderful facility,henry. She'll have her own roomwith 24-hour care. For the first timein almost 50 years,we won't be living together. You gonna be okay? I have to be. I promised her. what's wrong? That man loves that womanmore than anythingin the world. He stayed with her,for better,for worse,and,uh,nowthey're gonna be apart. Sam... just becausethey're not gonna beliving together anymore,just because... they won'tbe sleeping in the same bedor havingthe same conversations, it doesn't meanhe's gonna stop loving her. That man is going tolove her always. He's gonna love heruntil the day he dies,but... he needs to move on. I need to knoweverything there is to knowabout digeorge syndrome because I'm gonna keep my baby,and I need to be prepared. I can't stay with somebodyI can't trust. We are gonna be there for you,for whatever you need. Amy,laura,hear me out. Stay away from me. You need to leave. Hey,I'm talking to them,not you. No,not anymore. Please.I need to see them. They don't want to see you. -Don't make this worse by-- -I love them. I want to help. Amy just gave rth. Laura is dealing witha pregnancythat's takena very difficult turn. And they both just found outthe man they love is a liar. Don't make this worse. If you really love them,if you want to help... leave. You want me to walk away,to walk away from them? Right now,yes. And they maynever want to see you again. That's something you're gonnahave to live with. But you married them,you made commitments,and you have children. What I'm saying is thatyou are gonna spendthe rest of your life making sure that amy and laura and these childrenare taken care of. He still hasn't called? No. I'm sure it's notas bad as it seems. Oh,no,it is. I will never hear that sexy,S.W.A.T.-Y voice again. this here is my desk,and this is my chair. -pretty cool,right? -I like it. Can I spin? Yeah,you can spin. Meet betsey. betsey,this is addison and naomi,and thesare daddy's friends. Can you say hello,please? Hi. Your daughter? W-why didn't youtell us? Go make me a picture,okay? I'll put you here. Well,I wanted to,um... but... it'sa little compliced. I was 17... and her mom and iweren't together very long. And now? well,uh,her mother's an addict,and last month,she relapsed. I just... I just wanted herto be proud of me,um,you know, to seethat one of her parentshad it together. That's whyI brought her here. Addison,I promiseI'll have it all cleared outby tomorrow,okay? Hey,betsey. How do you likeyour daddy's office? I love it. Yeah? I think I'm ready. To leave? To date. Okay.Yeah. so what happens now? This is gonna be harderthan I thought. So... I told them... you're my girlfriend,and if they didn't like that, they were gonnahave to deal with me. You did? What about violet? I think she was worriedabout us coming out,but... I took care of it. That's it? She's happy for me... for us. I guess I misjudged her. did you bring your squad car? I need an explanation,addison. I chted on my husband... with his best friend. And after that... my ex-husbandcheated on me,too. So when you said,uh,you said... "I love you,"it took everythingto this whole other place, this dark placewhere the stakes were high. I couldn't trust you--not because of you--because of me. And I think I was aredbecause I do like you. I like you... a lot,kevin,and I am... not in a placewhere I can say what you said,but... I think if you wereto stick around a little while, I might be able to get there,because you arehonest and loyaland worthy of trust. I messed up. but I think... I might get there. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- Proudly Presents</font> Sync: YTET-Âí´óÅÝ -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font> private.practice
