no talking. my life has too much talking. how does kevin leave one sockehind? i mean, don't you think he'd notice that one bare foot when he went to put his shoes on? call him. he walked out. you miss him. call him. do you want to go get a drink tonight? i'll figure it out better then i'm drunk. i... can't. i-i have to work. work? wyatt work? pacific wellcare work? working for the enemy? oncofertility is new, and it's interesting. you think wyatt's interesting. well... he is. he's arrogant. yeah, but he's smart and incredibly handsome. you're not really... oh, okay, you know what? never mind. - i am--none of my business. - exactly. if you want to sell your soul, i'll still be your friend. when i used to go in for chemo, to help me get through it, i'd concentrate on exactly what was going to happen. and when you implanted the ovarian tissue, i tried to imagine the blood starting to flow and my ovaries starting to work again-- claudia, this is not your fault. the tissue is very fragile, and your body has been through much more than any body should. i just thought if i was positive, it would work. i picked out the crib and i painted the nursery yellow. we tried, claudia. there just wasn't enough blood supply in your abdomen for the ovarian tissue to survive. and there's nothing else? i'm not gonna be able to have a baby? wait, well, we only implanted half of the ovarian tissue that you took out, right? right, but we just saw, the procedure doesn't work. no, my procedure doesn't work, but if we were to implant the ovarian tissue deeper, more proximate, to--to a more vigorous blood supply, then-- - next to the uterus? - yeah. well, what you're saying is theoretically possible, but the surgery is far too complicated. - i don't know anyone that can-- - i do. and this person could help me? i don't know. i'll have to ask her. oh, sorry. betsey. pacific wellcare ruins another day... and a shirt. heather was supposed to pick her up first thing. that's okay. i got another shirt in the office. honey, maybe not such a good idea to be throwing balls around - in the office, okay? - it wasn't her fault. - it was mine. - what wasn't your fault, champ? oh, dr. freedman. arlene. hi. oh, my god. is this michael? dude, you're a giant. will, you remember me? hi, jeffrey. that's a pretty cool plane. hey, let's go back. come on. so where you been? it's been, uh... - two years. - yeah. i moved the boys to switzerland... - oh. - for jeffrey. i found this great experimental program there - for autistic children... - mm-hmm. nontraditional therapy, megavitamins, - diet modification... - mm-hmm. along with art, music therapy. and how's it been going? better, i think. his temper's under control a little more. um, he's obsessed with airplanes. - sometimes he'll even talk to you... - wow. as long as it's about planes. planes are good. talking about planes... even better. and how's his health otherwise? oh, jeffrey's fine. no, i-it's michael, actually. - oh. - he caught a cold on the plane. it's probably just some bug, - but, you know... - all right. - i wanted to be safe. - up for you. so how'd you like switzerland, michael? they had a cable car, and there's this one place where you could take a chocolate tour, and my best friend has sheeps and cows at his house. what? sheeps and cows at his house? i made butter. you did? you made butter? really? wow. hmm. 102. does your throat hurt, michael? - nope. - okay. open up for me, big and wide. tilt your head back. ahh. dr. freedman? what is it? what's wrong? i need to ask you something, and i know what you're gonna say, so i don't want you to say anything, at least, not until you hear me out. it's about wyatt. i need a favor. no. i'm not helping you get a date. huh. no. not for him, for my patient. - his patient. - who i'm trying to help.</i> but i can't, and you can. - we have to close the doors. - see, even cooper realizes pacific wellcare is putting us out of business. no, we have to close the doors. my patient has the measles and was in reception for half an hour running around. everyone that was out-- all our patients this morning have been exposed. measles? my pregnant patient... - and the elderly. - all at risk. - we have to close the doors. - we have to close the doors. www.1000fr.com presents capture:frm@evelyn~zx sync:frs@°º</font> private.practice season2 episode11</font> i'm sorry for the inconvenience, but the virus stays airborne for up to four hours. we need to make sure everyone who was exposed has been immunized. uh, excuse me? can i get the shot now? i have a lunch at 12:30. oh, i'm sorry. it contains a live virus. it's not safe to take when you're pregnant. but if your blood comes back and your antibodies are low, then we can treat it with immunoglobulin. and if that doesn't work? doesn't measles lead to birth defects? let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay? uh, we need to notify l.a. county health. they're gonna want to do a complete survey. and they're always awful. as if we didn't have enough to do this morning... okay, i have a light day. you have to deal with this. i'll speak to the health department. i'm, uh, i'm in the mood for a fight. - will's fine. - so far, but he hasn't been vaccinated, and he's at risk to get this. it's the measles. i-i-- when my parents were growing up, everyone got it. and hundreds of people died from it every year. - the vaccine changed-- - don't even think of suggesting-- there's no proven link between vaccinations and autism. it's not just me. i have talked to dozens of parents. you vaccinated jeffrey, and it was like a light went out inside him, and he's living in some parallel world. - arlene-- - you don't live with him. so don't ask me to risk will, too. hey. hey, i can't get ahold of betsey's mom. i don't know if she's been immunized. - most kids have been. - you don't know her mother, okay? she forgot to pick her up. you think she remembered doctor visits? sh-should i just give her the shot to be sure? i mean, she played with that kid for, like, a half-hour. you have 24 hours...? so wait for the mom and ask, spare her the needle if you can. grab a chart. we're checking every patient who was in here this morning for immunization. how many of these are we looking at, cooper? - how many what? - these littleime bombs-- kids coming in without their vaccinations. the vast majority... whether or not to vaccinate should not even be open for debate. well, it isn't, but i agree with the academy of american pediatrics that we shouldn't abandon patients who choose not to vaccinate. cooper's right. you can't kick a kid out just because the parents believe in a conspiracy theory about vaccines. the c.d.c. is clear-- vaccines do not cause autism, they save lives. that's the end of story. hey, i was just in the pediatric waiting area with betsey. uh, this is michael's mom's, and she left it in the lobby. so if she was down at pacific wellcare... then her kids were, too. someone's going to tell ...? uh, hi. i need to speak to dr. king. it's important. you're dr. freedman, right? - yeah. - i'm sheldon. sheldon wallace. - violet's friend. - right, yeah. well, i hope so. i... i'd like that. she's, uh... how is she... violet? - exposed to the measles. - exposed to the measles? a kid in our practice has the measles, which is why i'm here. this concerns me how? well, you have this wonderful coffee bar that you advertise so prominently, and a lot of our patients wander by on their way upstairs. it is good coffee. you've exposed my entire practice to the measles? claudia jenkins needs a surgeon, a surgeon with a background in both gynecology and fertility, someone who can implant the ovarian tissue close enough to the uterine blood supply to allow her to produce her own eggs. naomi was right. you want a miracle. no, i want you-- just as a surgeon. you'd perform the procedure at st. ambrose-- neutral territory. you bill all you want. naomi and i do the follow-up. you just go in and cut and implant, and you're done. claudia gets a baby. you're not tainted by working with me. take a look. tell me that this surgery wouldn't be amazing. you don't get me at all. you think all i want to do is cut? if i do a surgery,i do the follow-up. i make sure it takes, i see the pregnancy the whole way through. now you may just look at procedures and outcomes. but my patients get me for the whole process. well, that would be even better. read the file, dr. montgomery... before you say no. are you still having sex with the same guy? with the same guy. finally gonna fess up and tell me with who? i told you whom it was, and you didn't believe me.</i> who it was,and you told me pete, which is obfuscation. - lying, really. - it's pete, cooper. i'm having sex with pete. you need me to prove it to you? lift your shirt. - excuse me? - i need you to lift up your shirt. - trust me. i'm a doctor. - you're a pediatrician. that's like half a doctor. lift. this isn't one of your weird... there's a tattoo. you're sleeping with violet? do you have to sleep with everybody? i don't sleep with everybody a-- you sleep with people and then they leave the practice. do you want violet to leave the practice? i'm not gonna leave. - you told him? - it's just sex. oh, no. you're not capable of just having sex. you are a relationship junkie. and pete is the anti-relationship. pete is the ruiner of relationships. - pete is-- - right here. and you know it's true. isn't that, like, the proverbial pot calling the kettle-- cooper, cooper, cooper, i'm fine. we're fine. there's nothing to worry about. claudia jenkins could have a baby. thank you, addison. there's one condition. - yes. - this is a one-time thing. we help claudia, and then you are done working with wyatt. - you're...you're blackmailing me. - no, no, it's not blackmail. it's ...? i'm doing this for your own good, nai. what, so--so that i don't become corrupted and evil like him, so i don't extort promises from my friends? do you want me to do the surgery? i guess i have no choice. okay, so that's it. everybody's been immunized. everybody that was here has been contacted. you can rele all these immunization records-- oh, no, he can't. sonya nichols. county health department. i'm gonna need those. oh, uh, sam bennett. i, uh, i called you. uh, are--are those all the immunization records? uh, yeah. yeah, this is everything. i want the vaccination records of all the patients in your practice, and then after i interview all personnel and review their employment certificates, i'll need to inspect your isolation facilities. well, we don't have, uh, isolation facilities per se, uh, but--well, wait. we, uh, we provide for rooms. - we ...we just-- - are not up to current guidelines? or are you aware of the recent changes in those standards? uh, this isn't gonna be very much fun, is it? you want to show me around? yeah. all right, this way. his--his fever, it was 104 by the time i got home. i-i couldn't get it down. how you feeling, michael? i'm really cold, and my stomach hurts. - he vomited twice. - his lungs are congested. oh, okay. okay, we got you. it's okay. we're gonna get you some fluids, and we'll bring that fever down, and you'll feel better. i need a nasal cannula at 2 liters, chest x-rays and ... cultures times two. i don't understand. why is he so sick? arlene, measles is serious. it can lead to pneumonia, encephalitis-- all sorts of other complications. ...? michael's resting now. his fever's down. but he's still having trouble breathing. my husband is-- is still in switzerland. you don't think he... needs to fly back? if it was my son, i'd come. arlene, we need to talk about will. i-i--no. i told you no. no vaccinations. i don't think you can risk putting will through what michael's going through. i can't risk putting will through what jeffrey's gone through. i lost one child to autism. i can't lose another. - arlene, you won't-- - don't you think ... seeing michael in there like that... i would do anything for my kids. i can't. look at him. don't you remember when he was 2, that smile? he'd light up the room. and then you vaccinated him, and that kid vanished. those vaccines took him away. i don't care what you know. i know what i know. i know what i lost. i can't risk it again. i can't believe this health department lady is making us jump through all these hoops. she's horrible. how's michael? uh, not good, and arlene still won't let me vaccinate will. - you should call family services. - you serious? yes, it's child abuse. she's knowingly putting her son at risk for getting really sick. - it's irresponsible. - it's a parent's decision. yeah, well, if i find out that heather didn't vaccinate betsey, i'll report her. can i see you a moment, dr. bennett? perfect. that can't be good. sam's right. i gotta call. calling d.c.f.s. while her other child is still in the hospital would just be cruel. cruel? putting ant other child in dangerous is cruel. exposing a city to measles is cruel. violet's right. you can't fault the mother because she chose not to-- oh, yeah, of course you're agree with violet, you're sleeping with her. i agree with her because she's right, and i'm sleeping with her because it's part of the fun of being an adult. we can do whatever we want with whomever we want, however much we want. so if everyone would just relax and let us be adults about this... we need to go over protocol. um, how did you dispose of the contaminated exam items used on the sick boy? tongue depressors, gloves, thermometer cover? uh, we use a, uh, a medical waste company. needlesticks--did you follow c.d.c. approved guidelines? i-i-i assume so. i-i can check, but-- and what kind of ventilation system do you have? 'cause you'd be amazed how many practices don't have a laminar flow room. right. yes. laminar flow is good. you don't know what that is, do you? dr. nichols, look, i've spent hours, uh, jumping through hoops for you-- you shouldn't have to jump through hoops. it should all be standard. it should all be covered in your procedures and policy manual, which it's required by law you have. so i can see it? you want to see our p-procedures and policy manual? yes. okay. look, we just rented out a floor and moved all oufiles. so it may take a while. okay, well, you have till tomorrow to find it. violet has got to know that this is not good for her or the practice. says the person who slept with my brother. oh, now that was-- - oh, different? - oh, yeah, - totally and completely different... - uh-huh. - in every way. - what? - are you okay with it? - yeah, she seems happy. pete... seems happy, you know, i... - hi. - hi. can i help you? yeah, i'm looking for dell parker. uh, you are? i'm heather. i'm betsey's mom. oh. uh, yeah. his office is at the end of the hall. - it's the last one. - thank you. uh-huh. that's heather? she's so... she's not at all what i expected. why did you do that? - violet-- - i told you to tell you,</i> not to tell everyone. - i have to go to the bathroom. - what's your issue? you-- you don't want me to be happy? of course i want you to be happy. - i have to go to the bathroom. - are you jealous of pete, - is that it? - no. no. okay, maybe a little. look, you have what charlotte and i had-- the "just sex" part-- before it got all messed up with emotions and feelings and betrayal, which is where the "just sex" train ultimately leads. i don't want you to get hurt. look, this is not "romeo and juliet," coop. there's not some tragedy looming. we--we had an itch and we scratched... and scratched... and scratched. okay. that's all it is. it's just that last time... allan-- i know what i'm doing, coop. i do. i'm sorry i told... everyone. can i pee now? yeah. yeah. okay. - mommy! - hi! i had a job interview, and they really liked me, so they made me take all these different tests. it took forever. i'm sorry. babe... why don't you go finish that puzzle, okay? mommy needs to talk to daddy. you couldn't call? you leave your daughter alone all day and you don't call? - i forgot my phone. - are you using? no. no. look, i know you're mad, but i knew she was safe with you, okay? i-i couldn't leave to make a call. i did not want to blow this interview. well, she's not safe, okay? she was exposed to the measles today, and i-i don't even know if s's vaccinated because, you know, i'm not around enough, and you... is she vaccinated? um... you don't know, do you? no. i thought that was you. not going home? ugh. it's been a hell of a day. yeah, but a cup of non-fourth-floor coffee, the fresh air, the ocean-- it all goes away. look at you, all calm and buddhist. so you and violet? it's no big deal. it's not a relationship. well... if you're happy... things not going well with you and kevin? kevin and i are... different, and i still haven't figured out if that's a good thing or a bad thing. you want my advice? - please. - ignore all advice. cooper is all over violet about how i'm gonna destroy her life. i just think people should be left to decide things for themselves. and what do you think? - about you and kevin? - about you and violet. oh. w-well, i... the conversation is easy, the sex is... good. we laugh a lot. i mean, it's no big deal. we're just similar and we want the same thing, so it's working out. what? you've got all that, and it's nbig deal? isn't that what a relationship is? oh, violet. good morning. hello, sheldon. it's good to see you. i've missed seeing you. elevator rides are always more pleasant with you. hold the elevator. glad to see i'm not the only one. so you look... did you do something different? y-you look great. she did something different. well, whatever it is, just keep doing it. there's a little bleeder on the distal uterus. got it. hey, do you think i missed the boat with pete? ugh. you didn't miss e pete boat.you dodged hurricane pete. you really think it's gonna end that badly? are we talking about the same pete? sorry i'm late. lots of patients to save. well, why don't you go save some more and let us work? work, or discuss dating colleagues? which truthfully, i concur is a bad idea. however, since this is our last case together, monty, it won't be a problem for us. she's involved with a cop who has a gun. yeah, so you better watch out. a cop? are you really dating a cop? i am not intimidated by a man with a gun. are you? intimidad? hardly. no, i was thinking of their propensity for depression and divorce and alcoholism. yeah, as opposed to doctors, who have a stable, stress-free life. true, true, but i could see how a cop fulfills some kind of base fantasy for a woman like you. wow. did you miss the sexual harassment seminar? well, i meant it as a compliment. i mean, she's a rich, classy woman. he's your version of the pool boy. okay, enough. you are here to watch. you know what i got here? i'm not in the mood, charlotte. public health notifications, isolation requirements, incident reports, c.d.c. surveys. we all have jobs to do. i have jobs i'm not able to do because i'm dealing with the mess you made. and i have a mom who feels like she lost one son to autism and may be losing another one to the measles, and she's got another one sitting out here exposed, and maybe i'm just not persuasive enough, but he's vulnerable, and she's not gonna let me do anything about it. so i'm really sorry if i piled on some paperwork for you, but i don't need crap from you right now. he can't breathe. full custody? you want full custody? i'm trying to keep betsey safe. now? now that i've changed? now that i'm finally getting it together? you left her here all day. but i got the job, dell. okay, but... how long until you blow it off because, you know, you hate it or you're bored or you start using again? i got the job, and then i got home and i got this letter. and you know what i wanted to do, but i didn't. i freaked, but then i looked at betsey, and i didn't use. i came here to talk to you about what's best for her. i'm glad u didn't get high. but it doesn't change things. all you see is that girl from the valley that you used to get high with. i stopped. well, you might have been stronger than me then, but don't forget who got me started, okay? because i wasn't always like this. just don't make me spend every last dime that i have trying to fight you. it's gonna push me back over the edge. every bit of tissue around her ovaries is friable. i can't place a stitch without her starting to bleed. how much chemo did you give her? i did what i had to to save her life. no, there's too much blood. i've gotta clear the field. - damn it. - you need to implant the tissue now. everything i touch bleeds. we can't do this. you have time and to complete the implant. back off, wyatt. i can't see the target through the blood... and her pressure's dropping. if you don't get this done now, she loses any chance of ever having a baby. if i don't stop and we don have to worry about a baby. addison. all right. we're done. wyatt, shut your mouth while i save her life. it won't pass. his throat's too swollen. get the ber-optic scope now. we gotta ventilate him. heart rate is dropping. sats are bottoming out. where's the damn scope? it's coming, cooper. open up a surgical tray. i'm gonna crike him. hold this. what--what--what is that? what--what are you gonna do? just wait, cooper. the scope's coming. his heart's 40. i'm doing this. betadine. wait. wait! slowly. easy does it. almost there. almost there. i got it. sounds good. he's gonna be okay? set the vent at an f102 of 100, rate of 24. i need a minute. hey, i'll watch 'em for a minute. hey. come here. come here for a second. get the hell away from my son. mommy! - you have to stop. - your son is dying in there. get the hell away from me. - mrs. perkins, please. - no! well. are u okay? the vaccine is safe. you don't know. it is. look at him and tell me it is. vaccines are the standard of care. dr. freedman did something that was medically necessary. he assaulted my son. and i am going to sue this hospital, so help me, if something happens to him. i did what i felt i had to. it wasn't yours to do. it wasn't yos to do. code blue, p.i.c.u. code blue, p.i.c.u. i went under thinking about the crib in the yellow room. i wish we could've done more. i know i should just be grateful for being alive. we all wanted to help you. and i'm not giving up, claudia. i'll be back later, okay? nai, would you go over post-op instructions wh claudia? i'll be right back. what was that about? that was about my embarrassment for picking the wrong person for the job. you're blaming this on me? the chemo ravaged her entire body. there weren't 2 square centimeters of healthy tissue that could've held a suture let alone an implant. you talk like you searched exhaustively. what are you talking about? you didn't push. i agreed to do a totally experimental procedure that, going in, we all knew was a longshot, and when i felt the risks to the patient's life outweighed the potential for success, i chose to save the patient. you had time. you could've controlled the bleeding and implanted the tissue, but you hate me, so you didn't want to be told what to do, so you stopped. you wanted to prove that you knew better. i'm no surgeon, but i think there was time. well, i'm sorry if what happened in there didn't produce the results that you wanted for some study, but i made the right call. you really believe that? - dr. bennett. - i got it. i got it. okay. everything is in here. all right? protocols for workspace contamination, follow-ups for patients with positive labs, blood draw procedures that include responses to needlesticks. okay. wait, that's it? you... you're not gonna read it and ask me about our policies on work-related injuries or-- i'm sure you did a very thorough job. you knew that i wouldn't be able to find it, and you knew that i would kill myself trying to come up with it. well, by law, your office needed to have that. - now you do. - you enjoy this, don't you, the power? coming in here, pushing me around... oh, i... that's not true at all. i've been nothing but professional. you've been a bully. you just can't stand real doctors, can you? do you... know what it's like to have everyone hate you before they even meet you, to walk in the door and have everyone assume that you're awful? i don't know what some evil public servant did to you in a past life, but i'm here to do a job, a job i think is important. if there were a serious outbreak here, you'd want someone like me, because i am a real doctor who chose this job to help people. all right, well, maybe i was wrong, but... for the past two days, you haven't even looked me in the eye or even acknowledged that i'm a human being. what is your problem? for two days, i've been thinking your lips would taste like chocolate, and i couldn't look at them. i'm--i'm--i'really sorry that i misjudged you. do you believe that people can change? ugh! look, if one more person butts in and tries to tell me what pete is and what we should be doing-- wow. uh, i was talking about heather. oh. okay. so you and heather... okay, well, heather says that she's not the person she used to be, and... that by taking custody of betsey, i'm punishing her for her past. are you? i just don't know if i can believe it, that she's different now. well, you have to protect your daughter. right. but if you're asking me if i think people can change, if i didn't believe that, i couldn't do what i do. when you look at betsey and heather, and yotake away what you want, what's best for your daughter? what? i don't think it's ridiculous... the idea that you and me-- that... we could be more than sex. pete-- don't think about what cooper would say or sam or naomi or anybody. just think about... what you think. why does it have to be a crazy idea? asystole. i can't find a pulse. resuming c.p.r. another round of epi. cooper, we've done everything. it's been over a halhour. where's the atropine? come on! it's time to call it. i'm running the code. i decide when we're done. please... don't stop. time of death--3:37. michael? he just learned to tie his shoes. he can't be gone. not like this. oh, michael. oh, michael. oh, michael. michael. i thought... it was gonna be... like a cold. i was trying to protect him. you did everything you could. what are you doing in here? i was thinking about the two doctors that came before addison... about you... and them leaving. people can change, violet. isn't that what you told dell? yes, you can change. i-i don't know if i can change what i know about you... how i look at you. what about what you feel? well, i can't separate that out. what i feel is aombination of all those things, and i can't help it. look what happened between you and meg. i screwed that up, but it was wrong before i screwed it up. i like what we have, pete. i mean, i... i love what we have. but i don't... want it to be more. wouldn't that be a good thing-- what we have, but... more? i don't know. what are you doing here? come to get evidence? there's no needles, dell, no booze. - hey, beautiful. - hi, daddy. i came to apologize. look... you were right, okay? i-i should've called, and i should've been more responsible about the vaccines-- not about that. for getting you started... addicted. i should have kept you away from my friends back then. i'm sorry, heather. well, i'm doing better now. you know, we're doing better. i know. i can see. but i need more time with her, something more permanent. dell-- maybe we can... work it out, you and me, without court. okay? i just... i need to know she's safe. apparently, i'm a misogynistic, manipulative son of a bitch... and ungrateful. you agreed to do something you didn't want to do, and i should've been more gracious. you protecting my honor? i don't like bullies. maybe he was right. oh, i hate him. i hate his arrogance and his pushing and... if claudia was my patient, maybe i'd have done the same thing. pushed to ma it work? addison... you saved her life. look... if you want to work with wyatt again, work with wyatt again. don't not do it because of what i say. you comfortable with that? i'm not comfortable thinking that my advice colors what you say or, you know, what you do. hate him for yourself. or not. want to get a drink? i could use one. no. i am going to take my own advice and decide something for myself. come on in. um... i wanted to finish the conversation from the elevator. i, uh... i meant what i said, violet. i like you. and i'd like for us to be friends. and i'm not exactly sure how one goes about doing that, because i'd like to get to know you better. not go out on a date, just go out, as friends and without all that pressure of sex and dating and... i just... i think we'd be good friends. i think you're right. hey, kevin. it's me.
