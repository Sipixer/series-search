Eliminate her. I told you, when the models are walking, do not call. Doug Come upstairs. Upstairs. What's going on? Where's Karen? She's in there. She's been so sick, so sick, and... I didn't know who to call. You're still my therapist. I didn't know who to call. It's gonna be all right. I killed her. I killed my wife. - You did that on purpose. - Come on, man. If you didn't suck you wouldn't get hit. I don't suck. I played on a team, man. - You suck. Say that to my face. - I am saying it to your face. You suck! - We need women. - Word. - I hate racquetball. - Man, she's working in our building. Charlotte is working in the building. I can't get away from her. Naomi... she's right down the hall. You think that's easy? You know, I wish she would just die. No, not in a bad way. Just like... slightly dead. You know, then I wouldn't have to see her face. She'd just be a memory. You ever wish Naomi dead? That's... the mother of my child. Yes, I do, actually. When she had sex with that guy, I wished she was dead. - All right, let's go again. - I got you. Hold up. - What's up, Violet? - She's calling you? She wouldn't let me call her when the models are walking. Why is she calling you? - Traitor. - I'll be right there. Just a few more notes to make. - Ten minutes tops. - Don't worry about it. I figure I could get 5 miles in before bed. You ran this morning, and you don't run. Who are you, and what have you done with Meg? I am bored. I'm out-of-my-head bored. I'm running bored. You know what I do all day? Nothing. And after that, nothing, and then a little more nothing. I mean, what do people do all day who don't have jobs or kids? 'Cause I can't spend all my time running around the neighborhood. My thighs are killing me. I'm freaking out here. I know it's frustrating being in a new place, trying to figure out where you fit in, But don't run. - You know, get a job. - A job? Now why don't we... hurt your thighs a little more... In a non-running way? - I'm going home. - You're not going home. I don't want to... just... Would you just stop bathing me like I'm an invalid? You got shot. You want to be both shot and dirty? I'm serious. I don't want to be your responsibility. I don't want to be... - I don't want to be a burden. - You're not a burden. Kevin, look at me. You're not a burden. Let me take care of you. Karen was out of her head with the pain. The blood... She was always spitting up blood. Her condition was fatal. You know that. And she was begging me to help her, so I just... I did. I helped her. All right, Karen was sick for months, and I know that she was dying, but there were so many other ways that you could've helped her... palliative care, - pain management. - She didn't want that. She was done. She just wanted to go. So you shot her in the head? - Doug is been through a trauma. - They had a troubled marriage. He said he was gonna leave her before I diagnosed her. Karen was... - she was helpless. - It's not like that. Time to go. I was only trying to help her. So you're his shrink, and... who are you? Dr. Bennett is... was Karen's doctor. Karen was suffering from kidney failure secondary to wegener's disease. She was sick. I get it. Did he ever talk about hurting his wife, wanting her dead? - Well, I... when we... - Well, whatever he said is privileged. - So you're okay protecting a murderer? - I'm protecting my patient. What about you, Dr. Bennett? You gonna stay silent, or are you gonna protect your patient... Karen? We're leaving. The elevator's mine. You can have the fourth floor, but the elevator's mine. I'll give you one more day to calm yourself down, Then we're gonna discuss this like grown adults. Tell you what, Charlotte, go to hell. My god. He shot her? Wait, he shot her shot her? - As in killed her shot her. - Killed who? - Doug Adams murdered his wife last night. - He did not murder her. - He said she begged him to do it. - Oh, god, that poor man. - That poor woman. - Then it was a mercy killing? - Dell gets it. It was euthanasia. - It was a bullet to the brain. Look, I know Doug, - and he is not the type to... - There is no type. Regular normal people are driven to murder every day. Right? Love? Love will do it every time. Twisted, sick, messed up love... - Charlotte king is still alive, right? - I'm just saying, the impulse... We all have it. I didn't know you were coming here. - Can I talk to you? - Sure, give me one second. Not you. You. What did I tell you about the elevator? I'm not talking to you. - My day is made. - I need a favor. That's rich. You open a practice right underneath us, and you need a favor from us? I'm not coming to you from pacific wellcare. As chief at the hospital where you retain surgical privileges, - I'm hoping we can be civil. - What is it? - Don't engage. - Breathe. I can be civil. What is it? Full-term pregnancy. Eight months ago, she was in a car accident. Doctors did everything they could, but... - She's comatose. - And in an early labor. She just... moaned. That's good, right? She hasn't done that since right after the accident. Moaning is a good sign that she's starting to respond. - I think it's just a sign of labor. - Sean, the neurologist told you, She's nonresponsive. She wants this baby so much. We found out she was pregnant the day before the car accident. I think it was the happiest day of her life. The baby's in a breech position. Our O.B. tried E.C.V. to try to turn the baby, but... She's down too low. I need to do a C-section. You wanna book an o.R.? She needs to go through labor. She needs to deliver this baby herself. She can't. The breech position puts the baby at risk for a prolapsed cord, Which would cut off the baby's oxygen supply. The head could get trapped, potentially causing brain injury or worse. A woman in Kentucky, situation just like Alena, having the baby, it woke her. Alena needs to deliver this baby naturally, on her own. She has to. Alena is going to wake up. And we're gonna be a family again. Private Practice S02E08 Crime and Punishment</i> - He is going to kill his own child. - He loves her. He sat here every day. - He wants her back. - She's not waking up. "Rip van winkle's" a fairy tale. Don't tell me you're going sentimental. Hardly. Just... - I find him touching. - I need to do a C-section. I need to get the baby out now, or both mom and baby could die. We can't make him. We can't force him to let us cut her open. Look, maybe if you talk to him, get to know him. He warms up to you, and then you help him understand... That's your job, Charlotte, as chief of staff. My job as consult is to get the baby out. - I have a practice to get back to. - So do I. We... Have to work together to help that family. - We do. - I'll put her on terbutaline to temporarily stop the contractions, but that'll only get you through the end of the day. I'll consult legal. See if there's any way we can override the father and do the "C" without consent. He could've left, and he didn't. Why now? She was gonna die in what, in six weeks, three months? You think after years and years and years of this marriage, - He would shoot her now? - They had a volatile relationship, all right? Now you may have seen his side, but I saw hers. And she... - she was not suicidal. - Well, Doug was not homicidal. Except for the gun in his hand. - I don't think it was like that. - Well... Well, the cops are gonna want a statement from both of us, and... I'm gonna tell the truth. Well, if Doug gives me permission to talk to them, so am I. The actual truth or the truth that you want to believe? It's... No, it really... It's fantastic. I'm serious. - What's going on? - I like her, Pete. I went down to the Venice family clinic today to offer my services. Turns out they have a huge overflow of patients, but not enough exam rooms, but with NaomI's help, we found some room here. Here at... Oceanside Wellness? When the clinic has too many patients, I'll see 'em here. Addison's always talking about how, with Charlotte's practice opening, We need to expand our community outreach and raise our profile. Meg is the perfect liaison. Plus, she's willing to let Dell shadow. Oceanside Wellness gets to generate possible future income, and I get to avoid going stir crazy. Everyone wins. - Welcome aboard, Meg. - Thank you. All right, I have to go find Dell and get set up. See you later? Is it always this slow? Only when someone stops it. Are you okay? You're not claustrophobic, are you? Just impatient and in a bad mood. Anything I can do? Occupational hazard. I'm a therapist. And to be honest, I'm a bit nervous. Interviewing for a new job, you know? - On the fourth floor? - Yes, you work there? - No. I pushed 5, remember? - Right. Well, if you need to talk, - if there's anything I can do. - You know, I'm a shrink, too. I think I can handle it. I'm Shel... I'm Sheldon Wallace. Is there anything else you need? This is perfect. Better than I'm used to. - Can I just say, Dr. Porter, that... - Meg, please. I just know I'm gonna learn so much working with you. Well, I bet you could teach me a few things, too. Candy stash... under the microwave. See? That's critical information. Well, Dell, it looks like our first patient together is Renee Olsen. I was referred to Dr. Porter for... - termination. - I'm sorry? Termination. Abortion? It's not like I don't want her here. I just don't... Want her here. She just did it. She didn't even ask me. Welcome to my world. It's not like she went behind my back. - She just... - Went behind your back. Stop finishing my sentences. You know, she's a good doctor. She's gonna be fine. Did anybody know Meg was gonna be doing abortions? Look, I know I'm not a partner in this practice, and you guys might all be okay with this, but I want to go on the record for saying that I'm not. - Not okay with what? - Meg working here. Nai told me. Pro bono clinic. I think it's great. - She's doing abortions. - And? Wait, you men have a problem with it? Not as men. - We respect the choice, but... - I don't. - I'm not commenting. - We just didn't know. - You didn't know what? - Meg's doing abortions here. She's what? Nice digs you got in those exam rooms. They're palatial compared to grass huts. What? You should've told us you were gonna be doing abortions. That's all. Everybody without a vagina, leave the room unless you want to fight with me. - This is a problem? - I run a fertility clinic. And I'm in the business of helping women to get pregnant, - Not... - Wait. Abortion is legal in the United States of America, Naomi. Are you against choice? I am not gonna argue Roe V. Wade with you. I am just saying, they have never been done here and they should never be done here. It's a valid medical procedure for women in need. Not for me, and not for this practice. I'm sorry.... I have to run. I don't have a problem with it. We said she could work here. She can work here. - I'm ready for Renee. - She's gone. What? Where? I don't know where. I just know that she's not coming back. Well, what happened? Is she okay? Except for the part about her planning to kill her baby. - You talked her out of it? - I just told her what I thought, okay? I have work to do. I got a message that you're ready for me to do the C-section. I told you no. I meant no. - We want you to do the C-section. - These are Alena's parents. I called them after I had legal do some checking. Turns out Sean and Alena are not married. He has no right to make decisions on her behalf. We were gonna get married right after we found out about the baby. I mean, just because we didn't... I am still family. Don't you think we want her back? But she's not waking up. If you need to do a C-section to help the baby, then do it. The parents have the legal authority. I will schedule a C-section for this afternoon. Dell shamed a young woman for wanting an abortion. You offered abortions to patients without consulting anyone else. I'm a doctor. I don't need to consult anyone about my medical care. You're a doctor who's working with six other doctors who have opinions about cases and about the reputation of their practice. I'm screwing up your reputation? That's what this is about? You completely disregarded everyone else who works here. So, yes, that does reflect on me. This is my domain. Fine. I'll go. It's off. Baby daddy went to court to get an injunction as guardian over the baby. - Not gonna be any surgery, not today. - What? No, the patient is prepped and ready to go. Damn it. - So what next? - I'll see if I can convince a judge to get over here and clear this up. If the baby lives long enough. - Can I ask you? - What? You betrayed him. So how long is he gonna make me pay for my crime? He's angry. I don't see that ending anytime soon. - You're in love with him. - I am not. I just... I am not. This doesn't make us friends. We're not friends. Don't go getting any ideas. I have no intention of being friends with you. They're saying I murdered her. I didn't. I helped end her pain. Sam says... he thinks... When was the last time Sam saw her, two weeks ago? And for what, maybe half an hour? He didn't see how walking up a flight of stairs got to be more than she could take. I did. I had to listen to her moan in pain when the drugs wore off and panic 'cause I thought maybe she had died from a nosebleed. - Well, there were other options. - I did what she wanted. Look... I know Karen and I had a lousy marriage. I don't even know if I loved her by the end. But I did care about her. I just wish you had called me first. We could've talked about it. My lawyer says they're going for first-degree murder. I can't... do you know what it's like in here? Please. Please help me. I waive all privilege. Whatever it takes. Just tell them. Tell the police... Tell them I didn't murder her. You know me. Do you think I murdered her? Is it true that Pete found out that Meg was doing abortions and asked her to leave? - Not exactly. - 'Cause if that is true, - that is ridiculous. - What, Pete asking her to leave, or doing the abortions? Well, don't tell me you have a problem with Meg doing the abortions. - What? - I spend all day every day trying to help women make babies who... who stopped believing that they ever could. I can't believe this is such an issue for you. I... wish that I had known a doctor like Meg or a place like our practice when I needed an abortion. I had two. I had a very... misspent youth. I made some mistakes. - You don't have to tell us. - I wasn't going to, - but I'm not ashamed. - I was. I had one. And I was embarrassed and scared. I was everything a woman shouldn't be. Well, I fertilize eggs every day, and I believe that life begins at conception. - So what, it's murder? - I believe what I believe. Well, I believe that things aren't so black-and-white. Well, you know, you don't do what I do. I deal with the aftermath. I deal with women who've had children who shouldn't have. Maybe we should talk about something else. What are you doing here? I just thought y might be in the mood for a drink after a hard day at the office. No, thanks. Get out from in front of my door. Move. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I'll do the time. Whatever you want, I'll do the time. But I am sorry. Just... go home. I need time... to think. So I thought in my hotel room with the crisp white sheets and the - travel-Sized toiletries. - You didn't have to do that. You have two modes... off and on... and when you're off... Peter, you get cold. You're closed, you're shut down. It's like you're punishing me for something that I didn't do. You never used to be like this. The man I knew... we used to share everything. So what happened? What happened to you between then and now? The clinic is good. What you do for people is good. I overreacted. Come back. Good morning. Not so good. The district attorney's gonna subpoena Karen's medical records. You okay? I was up all night trying to figure this out. And I cannot get the image of Doug with that gun in his hand out of my head. So then you do think it's possible that... I don'know. No. I just... I wish there was somebody I could talk to, somebody who knows about this kind of thing. I'm kind of in uncharted waters here. I think I know someone you could talk to. Sit down. Sorry. I don't mean to bother you while you're recovering. Please... bother me. So... Doug Adams killed his wife. How do I know if it's murder or assisted suicide? Doug has had no difficulty with impul- sivity or anger control his entire life. He was submissive to his wife. I've never found any indication that he was remotely violent. In fact, I would be hard-pressed to concoct a scenario In which he had the temerity to strike out against his wife unless she instructed him. You don't think he got scared to leave and took the easy way out? Killing Karen would never be the easy way out for him. I just don't think Doug murdered his wife in cold blood. In all my years on the force, do you know how many women I've seen kill themselves or asked to killed with a gun? None. What's best for the child is to have a mother. What's best for the child is to be alive. I will not hear shouting. You want me to defer this to the courtroom? We can put the attorneys together and have'em drag it out until it's too late. I want to hear from you. The baby's in imminent danger. If I do nothing, it could suffer irreversible complications. And the hospital's position? You support dr. Montgomery? We want to give Alena every chance. That said, judge, we don't dispute dr. Montgomery. It is her only chance. Alena is our daughter. If we thought for one minute we could have her back... I have two choices, Sean. I can rule on this, Or you can withdraw your objection. I'd rather it come from you. - You look like you're in a hurry. - Thanks. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday. Ah, we all have bad days.? Today any better Actually, no. - I don't suppose you want to talk about it. - Yeah, it's complicated. Transference? Psychosis? I'm kidding. Murder. Or manslaughter. That's... big. You must be good. You'd think. You know the best way to cheer yourself up? - Cheer someone else up. - Oh, is... is that your brand of therapy? What is that, Jung or Freud, or, - or fortune cookies? - It's Mark Twain, actually. You like Twain? You see? There you are. You've cheered me up. People who like Twain always cheer me up. Did you get the job? I got the job. - We need to talk about renee. - I'm busy. We work really hard to create babies here. We are in the business of bringing babies into this world. I don't know you very well. I certainly don't know you well enough to judge you for this. But you don't know Renee very well, Yet you were quick to judge her. What... Was she raped? Would it matter if she was? Would that make it okay? I mean, does that make her more or less worthy? We don't get to know why. That is her business. That's her choice, Dell. That woman agonized over a difficult choice, Made it and came in here. I guarantee you she was already worried about people out there judging her only to have you make her feel ashamed. But we are medical professionals. It is part of our job to support her once she has made the hardest choice imaginable. - You're not allowed down here, sean. - I know. I... look, I just... I can't... I made her laugh. I made her laugh, and she looked away from the road and... I caused it. I was responsible for her coma. I don't want to be responsible for her staying like this. Please, I know what the judge said... I need a miracle here. I'm asking for a miracle. You have to stop punishing yourself. Sean, you didn't make that accident happen. And you don't make miracles happen. But I do. I'm about to go in there and deliver your miracle, Sean. And I know that this isn't the path that you sought out Or the one that you and Alena saw for yourselves. But this is your baby, the baby that alena wanted, and the one that she would want you to raise. So I'm gonna go in that O.R. and I'm gonna bring out that miracle. Did you talk to the d. A.? - What did he say? - You know, I didn't talk to him yet. I wanted to talk to you more. I was worried about you... Here... Thinking about what you did, What you had to do. It must have been awful. It was. To do that to someone you loved And to have her ask for that... For her to ask you to use a gun... Karen wanted it to be quick. She was afraid That something else wouldn't work. - She was just in so much pain and... - I know all about her pain, Doug. But what about your pain? I want to know about your pain. - Come here. - You're antiabortion. I am. Unapologetically. Do you think it makes a difference why a woman would want to have an abortion, - Like rape or... - I think it matters why it bothers you. What do you mean? If you're against it for religious beliefs or personal beliefs, that's one thing. God or something in your soul is trying to tell you something. I refused to even learn how to perform the procedure in medical school. I couldn't. I just... I couldn't. But if abortion bothers you for other reasons... What? Look, I don't want to be responsible for swaying you to the other side. Did your child's mother, did she consider having an abortion? You tried to talk her into getting one. And now you look into your daughter's beautiful face, and you feel guilty. We went to the clinic, and she wouldn't get out of the car And I yelled at her. I yelled at her, and, you know, now I just... I just can't believe I yelled at her. Then I think you are not against a woman's right to choose. You're just punishing yourself for the choice you almost made. - I've told you everything. - You released her. You gave her everything she wanted. So you should feel like a weight has been lifted. But you don't, do you? It's hard to feel that way when I'm in here. It must've been hard... Her in pain, yelling at you, Wanting you to help her. She made you feel awful every day of your life, So you must have thought that by helping her, the pain would go away. But it hasn't Because the truth is still eating away at you. I couldn't take it anymore. You need to let it go, Doug. Just let it go. She kept... yelling at me... For me to do things for her. She would say things to hurt me. She would lie in that bed and throw things at me And call me an idiot and a weakling and tell me everything I was doing was wrong When all I wanted to do was help her. And the more she would yell, the more she would bleed. And there was blood everywhere, And I couldn't take her and I couldn't take the blood, And... and I stopped feeling sorry for her. And... And all I thought about Was that I should have left her, But I couldn't leave her now. I couldn't just walk out the door, but I couldn't stay. I couldn't hear her yell anymore. I couldn't hear it. So I took the gun... And I stopped it. I stopped her. You murdered her. I put her out of her misery. You put yourself out of your misery. - I tried calling. - I know I got your message. I am so sorry for the way you were treated. Dell was out of line, and I apologize. I'm just - glad you didn't ignore my message. - Well, I did ignore it. I mean, I listened to it, But I wasn't going to come back. - Well, I don't understand. Why are you - Dell called me. Oceanside wellness performs its first abortion. Wonderful. - She's throwing multiple p.V.C.S. - Bolus her with 100 of lido And start a 2-Milligram-Per-Minute drip. Lap pad. Lost her pressure. V-Fib. She's going into cardiac arrest. Get a crash cart. She's throwing an embolus. Start C.P.R. Epi.5. Let's go. The baby? Got her. Charge to 200. Clear. Okay. You ready? You ready to see daddy? She's beautiful. She has your nose... - And Alena's eyes. - I'm so... So sorry for your loss. I'm afraid you can't. It's against hospital regulations. I want her to meet her mother, And I want to say good-bye. This is our daughter. Look what we made. I don't know if you hear this a lot from us, but... Thank you. I hope you know she made The best decision she could for herself. I just always thought medicine was going to be about helping people. It is. I'm proud of you for doing what you thought was right, but I just can't. Not now. We're on the same time schedule. - Can I ask your professional advice? - Sure. Step into my office. Well... let's say you have a client, And this client has been through hell. And it's a client that you like, You really like. And they've done something... wrong. Or maybe they've done something right For the wrong reasons... I'm not making any sense, am i? Did anyone get hurt? You have your answer... Don't you? I'm... I'm Violet. Violet turner. You asked what happened to me Between then and now. I have a dead wife that I hated... Hated... Until the moment she was gone. And if I could... Take back the hate... It killed a piece of me. There's a piece of me that no longer exists because of her. - So when you feel threatened... - There are very few women that I trust. You trust the women here... I'm doing the best I can, okay? He's going to prison for a very, very, very long time. Poor Karen. I feel so guilty that I ever believed in him. Are you at all religious? In church, when someone dies... We light a candle to rember them. What are we doing? Trying to forgive ourselves. Can I get in on that? A baby died today. Long day? Let me make you something to eat. You must be starving. You took care of me. Now let me take care of you. I'm fine. I made a miracle today. I'm fine. I'm fine.
