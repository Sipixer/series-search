how about... billboards? right? what? bad idea? what? i don't know, sam. i mean, i cut expenses, right? i cut expenses. even still, profit's only up 2%. so, i mean, the consults should help. don't you think? yeah. right? yeah, they should. this is a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure. hey. what are you doing here so early? running. you're running like you're trying to get someplace. naomi still isn't talking to me outside of work. and that makes you run? i'm her... friend. friends are supposed to talk. so yeah, i'm here, running, avoiding the office. i had to force myself to go in. yeah, the office has been odd. it's kinda like we're going through a divorce, only we have to keep living together. you running to get somewhere? no, i... do you think i'm old? tell me you did not sleep with that temp. (ighou.u hey, it seemed like thod t ta good idea at the time. yeah, well, at least you're getting out there. me? two dates seems to be my limit. the cop? he didn't call after our last date, so i called him, left him a message, a horrifying, embarrassing message. probably scared him off. not that i care. you know, i'm... glad to not be talking to him. well, at least he didn't tell you you were old. although... she did say that i was great. i'm fine. you ever feel like you're not pulling your weight, everybody at work is talking about you behind your back? how the hell did my perfectly arched back make you think of that? um... loofah to scrub, scrub to surgery, surgery to patients, patients to my lack there of. we're drowning. i'm drowning. i am making us drown. and when the raft is sinking, who do you think gets thrown overboard first? oh, the pediatrician who can't bring in the bucks. stay here and drown. i'm going to work. dell? what are you doing here? i work here. wow. gotta pay the rent... eat and- what are you doing here? uh, where's-where's the patient? i, uh, am the patient. i- i hurt my knee. it's- okay. it's not... just, uh... you didn't want to get this patched up at the office? well, you know, well, it's just a silly- it's just- they're very busy there. you know, it's great. it's great that you're here, you know? hospitals are great. it used to be my happy place. how's, uh, how's everyone? you mean how's naomi? she misses you. montgomery. so you're good? yeah. dell works here. who? blond, receptionist. he was the talking human who greeted you when you came to the practice. never mind. i just had a surgeon called away last-minute. patient needs a-a myomectomy. you interested? can't. got a whole fun-filled day back at the ranch. come on, montgomery. you love surgery. it's messy and bloody, and you get to save lives, not to mention the coin. i'll give you your own o.r. for a day. no. no. i... am off to work... fun-filled work. here you go. good luck to you. okay. hey. it took you 45 minutes to write that prescription. consults are supposed to take 15 minutes max. you're a stalker, sam. 15 minutes, $180, 4 consults an hour, $720 each hour. do i look like a money machine? you look like you could be working a lot faster. i agreed to do consults. i did not agree to do malpractice. and i'm not gonna write a prescription every time someone's doctor or therapist says they need prozac. i need to do a history - do the history, all right? just do it in 15 minutes. did someone shove rocks down his pants on the playground? he-he's compensating- all this bossiness. i liked him better when you were in charge. i'm sleeping with him. you're- sleeping with the enemy. so let me get this straight- he went behind my back took my job, made me feel like crap - and now you're sleeping with him. yeah. what's wrong with me? w- what's wrong with you? uh... you're-you're- you're a traitor, and you are letting him run all over you and change everything about this place- he sits there and he asks me questions about the practice, like what should he do, as if these aren't things that i hadn't thought of when i was running it. he's using you as a sounding board? i can't stand it and-and... dell's gone and addison... i have no one to talk to. i- i-i know it's wrong, it's just that sam has this way of- you know what? i don't want to know. no, no, no, no, no. it's just that he really - i don't want to hear it. i- i'm just saying that he- well, don't say. that's what we do. we're a family, and this practice is our home.</i> the life we save could be your child's...</i> your wife's... your husband's.</i> at oceanside wellness, our family takes care of your family.</i> morning. sorry. not in the mood. hey, nal. hey, i-i saw dell today. he's working at, uh, st. ambrose. dell's working at st. ambrose? coop. hey. morning. yeah, not now. can't talk. you're still talking to me, right? no time. no money, no time. i'm gonna go do a surgery. surgery brings income. it is messy and bloody and a whole lot more pleasant than being around here. okay. thanks. okay. thanks. morning. how are you, addison? i'm great. and you? how are you, mr. scrub cap? hi. you having a tough time? i hate this time of year- brush fire season. everyone's a little on edge. panic attacks again? no. no blackouts, no nightmares. mostly i'm handling it good. i was out at the 1,500-acre burn in santa cruz last month. everyone made it out, but it was a lot like - malibu. yeah, i saw the news. you should be proud of yourself for making it through, though. post-traumatic stress takes some people years. yeah, well, all that stuff you gave me- herbs, exercises, acupuncture- it helped, but the stress started creeping up on me, every time i saw my men go into the fire. but you got through it. i did, because i found something else to... help me cope. so what's the problem? i'm wearing bras... panties now. i need you to cure me. addison. oh, hey. it's you. s.w.a.t. guy. yeah, hey, hey. uh, listen, about that message i left... yeah, that was, um- humiliating. no, i-i liked it. yeah. oh, god, well... that explains a lot. you torture women to the point of them calling you and leaving horrifying messages because you like it. you're... you're sick. yeah, i'm sorry. i've been working like a dog. i get on a case and... i promise to do better. i came to woo. woo? i got sprinkles. this is you, wooing? this is me being charmed by your rambling and incoherent message... and asking you to lunch. yeah. i'm-i'm off to surgery. don't write me off. get to know me. okay, uh, your doctor sent me over your file. you've been having trouble sleeping? on a good night, i get four hours. i figured sleeping pills might help. any idea of what's preventing you from sleeping? two jobs, past due bills, a teenage son... oh, a teenager. that will do it right there, huh? and how long has this been going on, the insomnia? uh, since my husband died last year. but lately, it's worse. anything changed? aren't you just supposed to write a prescription? sure. i think it's important to understand what's behind the insomnia, to talk about it. i, uh... you know, i, um, i really- i just need to sleep. linda, the-the medication will help, but whatever's keeping you from sleeping, it's not gonna take that away. talk to me. see if i can help. i'm afraid of him. afraid of whom? my son. i think he's a sociopath. he killed our dog.  -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ°ÇãÇé·îÏ×==- ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾</font> -==http://www.ragbear.com==- Æ¬Ãûprivate practice µÚ2¼¾µÚ3¼¯</font> -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- ·­Òë£º¸öÈËid Ð£¶Ô£º¸öÈËid Ê±¼äÖá£ºûœûœÏÄ  i just- i found it in the garage. he was wrapped in a blanket, and i think his neck was broken. and it was just a little beagle. why do you think jesse would do something like that? i don't know. did you ask him? yes, and he just looked at me. he gave me this funny look. but he's the only one who had access to the garage. is he ever violent? have you ever seen this before? no. see, that's the thing. he was so... but when his father died, he changed. he got, um, cold. like he... he doesn't react. he doesn't laugh. he doesn't cry. he just has this cold, hard stare, and i-it just... you know, he's my own son, and i can't- everyone has their own way of responding to grief. it's not grief. i- i just need to sleep. i'd like to talk to him. no. i-i really want those pills. linda, you don't need the pills. you need some help. let me help. fishing, the boat, the sun on the water... if any of my guys find out, it's gonna be the end of me, done. keep trying to relax. focus on fishing. it doesn't work anymore. i need the panties and bra. how did this start, frank? it was just knee-highs around the house at first. and then i got my hands on a mail order catalog, and... pages and pages of pretty little things- lace bras... silk panties... garters. i see what you mean. i have to live with these guys 24 hours at a time. i almost got caught twice already. if they find out... my credibility... they won't trust me. they won't listen. and if i have to look at a man's family and tell them he's not coming home because- cross-dressing could go to something deeper, something a therapist could help with. no. i can't tell anybody else. frank, i'm- please. look, i trust you. you helped me before. i know you can help me now. you have to... or i'm... done. how'd it go? the fibroid's history. it was nice to be back in the saddle again. i have a newborn with a diaphragmatic hernia being airlifted in. don't you have someone else? i do have patients. double board certified neonatal surgeons aren't exactly walking the streets, montgomery. look, i hate to take you away from all the fun at the office, but on the bright side, you get to save a life and work with me. okay, i'm in. charlotte, that newborn being airlifted... you don't have somebody else. you knew i'd say yes. i hoped. you're wooing me with surgery. i am. hey, did you hear about dell? he's nursing at st. ambrose. so now you want to talk about dell? well, yeah. naomi - hey, nal, addison's staying at the hospital to do another surgery. could you cover her patients? uh, sure. cool. sam. yes. good ol' boss sam, you will be glad to know, i have a new patient. hey, one new patient. maybe we can build a new wing. what about you? don't you have a consult? i can't do it. my morning consult-major drama. it may take the rest of the day, so cancel everyone else you had booked. i know he's only a year old, but you wait all this time to have a baby, you want him to be perfect, and i'm-i'm just really worried that he's-that- that there's something wrong with him, you know, with... his head. his head? his head. what's wrong with his head? it's... big. not "big for a 1-year-old body" big, but "big for anybody's body" big. babies are sometimes born with large heads, but if you give it some time, they usually grow into 'em. it's not- it's a really big head. okay. let's take a look. hey there, little fella. you know, just to be on the safe side, i'm gonna run some tests, see if there's anything going on. so your mom said it looked like the dog's neck had been broken. any idea how that happened? it-it was in your garage. any idea about that? it was a beagle, right? dodger? your mom said you had it since, uh, you were 6. is that right? okay. the dog's too loaded a topic. uh... why don't we talk about your father? were the two of you close? did he coach any of your teams? i hear you're a great baseball player. okay, i get it. you don't want to be here. a lot of people don't like to talk about difficult things. but i have a job to do, and that is to find out if there's a problem here, and to do that, i need for us to talk... about anything. i want to get to know you, jesse. can i go now? please. dell? hey. so you're working here? you look nice... in your scrubs. what are you doing here, naomi? i just came by to say hi. it's great to see you. we've missed you. i've missed - i really can't talk right now. i got a ton of patients. dell. i'm sorry. i gotta go. i just saw this kid who had a head the size of... it was ginormous. it was huge. which is bigger, ginormous or huge? is it... who's the truant? consult's son. he won't talk, so i'm lettin' him stew. is stewing a real therapeutic technique? usually works with you. what's he stewing about? his mother thinks he killed the family dog. oh. step one, right? i mean, that's what they say about serial killers, am i right? oh, he's not a serial killer. i- well, not now. i don't even know if he did it. is the mom lying? she believes he did it. i- i don't know his side 'cause he won't talk to me. he-his father's dead, his dog is dead. he's got a lot of reason to be angry. you know, his mother thinks he's a sociopath. she goes on the internet, she puts together the signs - is he? i don't know. i guess i could test him... give him the m.m.p.i. it would be so much easier if he just had a pipe bomb in his book bag. you know-do you know how rare a true sociopath is? you don't want to be the one that missed columbine. you don't want to talk. i get it. leaves me with a problem, though. i have concerns about you, and i'm not comfortable with just watching you walk out that door. don't talk to me. just fill this out. true/false. or we can sit here all day. okay, just so we're clear, this is not a date. this is a sandwich between surgeries. point is, it's getting to know each other without all that date crap. mm. tell me about this case you've been working on. you know, the one that's kept you from calling. i watched two people die. it kinda made for a bad week. yeah. i have been having a run of those myself. not people dying, just people not talking to me... mm-hmm. people not talking to each other. all the people in my office are walking around pissed off, and nobody's talking about it. that's why i'm here... cutting people open. getting out your hostilities. actually... you put a scalpel in my palm, and i feel centered. all the other problems in the world just fall away. it's hard to explain. well, you can explain it to me tomorrow night when i take you out. you're taking me out? i am. on a date? yes. you're not going anywhere. pregnant lady with ovarian torsion. o.r.'s ready. you up for it, montgomery? yeah. mm. yeah, no, go. cut people open. all right. i'll see you, um, tomorrow night. tomorrow night. okay. you know, we could use you. sorry. excuse me? here. you could be a surgeon. i could keep the o.r. full and the board happy. it's a symbiotic relationship. i have a job, charlotte. you're a surgeon, addison. i'll think about it. big. how big? mount rushmore big. i'm thinking, like, paget's disease or acromegaly or tuberous sclerosis. i mean, this poor kid's gonna be, like, a bobblehead if i can't fix him. at least he won't be wearing a bra. unless it's to give his head more support. i keep telling you, it's not that unusual. it's a coping mechanism, and you said he's coping. yeah, but- i got a maybe sociopath who maybe killed his dog who maybe i should lock up. you got a bra and panties. you want to trade? what happened with your test? it's inconclusive. does he like to smash things? yes. does he feel anger? yes. the only way to know if he's a true sociopath is to do a comprehensive clinical evaluation, and the kid's not talking. so based on this test, he doesn't meet the criteria for me to hold him. he's not a clear danger to anyone. there's not a credible threat... except i still don't know what happened to the dog. does anyone have anything helpful to say? yeah. at least he doesn't have a big head. or wear panties. i've resected the cyst. i just have to detorse this ovary. montgomery, they need you in nicu now. baby you worked on before, 0-2 sats are dropping. crap. okay, let me just finish ligating this vessel. let me just take a look at the baby, make sure it's okay. done. go ahead and close her up. doctor. oh, uh, she's fine. i untwisted the ovary, removed the cyst. the baby's doing well. they're gonna be okay. is there any way i can- i can g- not now. maybe later. what about if i just - i'm in the middle of an emergency, but i'll come back to you. how many surgeries have you done? four. what about your knee? can't even feel it. wow. you're a badass. what, all you thought i did was deliver babies? hey, nal. so what's up? i, uh, just finished going over the budget. i can't believe there's all this paperwork. i feel like i'm doing six jobs now, and none of 'em is seeing my patients. yeah, well, it's, uh, it's tough being the boss. what do you think about hiring a marketing consultant? if you think it'll help. right? mm-hmm. all right. thanks. can you believe him? i mean, does he not think that i did the exact same things when i was in charge? only i wasn't stupid enough to try and do it all by myself. at least i had dell to help me manage to run things so that i could see patients. i saw him today-dell- at the hospital. it was really weird- i have a patient. i gotta go. so you're telling me he's normal? one test over one hour is not gonna answer that, but this does evaluate personality and psychopathology. what about the dog? he won't talk to me about that right now. but maybe if the two of you came in together, then - no, i can't confront him. you told me to bring him in here. you said that- that you could help me, and now he knows that i'm scared of him. it's- no, i didn't tell him- he's smart. you think he's not gonna figure this out? look, i can't... he had that dog for ten years, and he... he didn't shed a tear when it died. he snapped its neck and hid it in the garage, and he didn't shed a tear because he didn't care. linda- i can't sleep. i can't sleep. i lie awake with a h- with a hammer under my pillow because i'm afraid of what he's gonna do to me. and now you're telling me that you can't help me? you told me you would help me. you should have given me those pills, 'cause i could've buried it. i need you to help me, please. i'm afrid of my own son dell. um, i know you were busy before, and, uh, i had to see some patients. and i thought you might be getting off. i'm doing a double shift. i took you for granted. i didn't listen, and i should have. you were trying to help me, and i didn't let you. i want you to come back. i have a job, naomi, a place where i'm respected. the practice has been... adrift, dell, since you left. i've been adrift. you know, i'm not talking to addison, barely talking to sam, and violet doesn't want to hear from me. you're not there... to talk to. no. no, i'm here, doing things i love and-and learning a lot from people who aren't afraid to teach me. dell. i'm working, okay? i work here. excuse me. i think he's happy here, nal. it seems like a lot of people are happy here. just trying to do my part. that's nice. thanks for doing that for me when i was in charge. you never asked, naomi. that's the problem. you never asked. you're in a good mood. your montgomery's a real star. cash cow for me today. she's really making me look good. i'm glad someone does. stop mopin'. i don't like mopin' sex. i have a kid with a big head, who, as it turns out, has nothing wrong with him, except that he's going to be mocked and ridiculed and looked down on for the rest of his life. and that's your fault? no, that's me. i'm the one who doesn't fit in, who's gonna be first out of the practice because they don't want me on their team anymore. i am the bighead kid. oh, my god. you are pathetic. you are crazy and pathetic. a big head's not a problem. it's a virtue, moron. you know who had a big head? lincoln, j.f.k., elvis, einstein. plenty of people have big heads, and they don't sit and mope that they have a big head. so don't you sit and mope that you're a pediatrician. do your job, do it well, and screw everyone else. you're the bighead kid. more power to you. can we get our clothes off now? hmm? oh, i rescheduled your consults for tomorrow. no. n- no? life is not 15 minutes, sam. this woman and her son cannot be fixed in 15 minutes. well, i'm sure you did everything that you could. not yet. tomorrow i'm going to the kid's school, i'm talking to his teachers and his counselors, and i am trying to get answers to the questions he won't talk to me about today. cost-effective? no. but if it helps the kid... i'm sorry if this does not fit into the new way of doing things.</i> where's the fire? it's no joke. my fire captain, he's in the e.r. hey, hey, pete. hey. what are you doing here? firefighter patient. i got paged. what about you? you've been here all day. yep. you ever gonna come back to the practice? maybe. one day. see you. good luck. dr. montgomery, the ovarian torsion you fixed, her pressure's down to 80 over 40. post-op crit's 26 and dropping. she's bleeding out. what about the baby? it's in distress. open the o.r. extensive partial thickness burns, but he won't let anybody touch him except for you. he's over here. i'm here, frank. i couldn't let anyone see me. okay. get me a blood gas kit and run a carboxyheme level. i need a chem panel, c.b.c. and chest x-ray, and set me up for a subclavian. 5- story blaze... beam came down... everybody get out okay? you're not getting air, frank. you gotta stay with me. hang on. i'm almost there. you're gonna be okay. no. i'm done. are they okay? oh. your wife had some, uh, post-op bleeding, but she's safe, and the baby should be fine. when you came out of surgery before, you said they were fine then. they were, but then your wife started hemorrhaging. i had to go back in. and it's not because you ran out to some other surgery? no. no. it's not. what about now? i mean, you're- you're saying she's fine now, but how do i know? right now, your wife, she's doing as well as she can. she's a fighter. she's gonna come through this. what's her name? excuse me? my wife's name. you keep talking about "she" and "her" and "your wife," and you're running up and down this hall, and you're popping in and you're cutting people open, and you're talking about her like you know her, but you haven't mentioned her name. i... i don't know her name. it's heather. her name's heather. and this is the third time she's been pregnant. we lost two babies before. she keeps redecorating the nursery, hoping that that's gonna change things. it's red now. who... who ever heard of a red nursery? but her students- her students told her that it would be good luck, and she wanted to believe them. you operated on her twice today. you should've known her name. a few weeks, you should be you'rup and around.frank. and then what? i told you, i'm done. i can't believe that's true. i'm resigning. these guys depend on me. if they can't feel comfortable with me, if they think i'm a freak... we all feel stress, frank. you more than most. but you know what? you found a way to deal with it. some people drink too much, some eat too much, some people... run. i wish i had a thing that worked. when everything around you is falling apart and you need to keep it together, a thing is good. so i wear a bra and panties forever? maybe if you talked to someone, maybe if you didn't shoulder all of that stress yourself, it might be better. fine. i'll go to therapy. but it's still too late. you run into burning buildings and save lives. how many of your men have you gone in after? if it's me... i don't care what you're wearing as long as you get me out alive. 6 surgeries in 24 hours. what's it like? to be a surgeon? to be the best. i came here to get away from a bunch of people not talking, and i ended up being the one not talking... not talking to a single patient. i cut 'em open, sewed 'em up, and i didn't have any idea who they were. that's not a doctor, and it's certainly not the best. thanks for the job offer, charlotte, but i have a job, a home. i've run every lab i can think of. there's nothing wrong with miles' head. so it's... that's just the way he is. your son's fine, and he may grow into it. what if he doesn't? you must think i'm awful. i should be elated that my son is fine, it's just- he's different. yes. me? i was slow. the other kids could all run faster. i hated p.e. my best friend brad, he had two teeth that never grew in. he's the c.e.o. of a fortune 500 company now. i see a lot of kids, and they're all different in one way or another. he'll be picked on. maybe. maybe he'll be a bully. maybe he'll be president. you know, a lot of the presidents had big heads- j.f.k., lincoln. he's on mount rushmore now. thanks. you made my mom cry. what did you ??? i- i told her that i didn't think i could help you if you wouldn't talk to me. what are you doing here? i'm trying to figure out what you won't tell me. no. you let this go. my job is to help people, and i-i want to help you. and i am not gonna stop talking or asking questions until you answer some. what happened to the dog? what happened to the dog, jesse? jesse... you loved that dog, didn't you? you loved that dog, you didn't shed a tear, and i want to know why. tell me why. do you know how much it costs to put a dog down? do you? he had cancer. it was thousands of dollars to treat him, and she was gonna do it. my dad's cancer almost bankrupted us, but she was gonna do it because she couldn't bear to see another thing die again. she didn't want me to have to go through it again. we couldn't afford it. it was $385 to put him down. we didn't have that either. so i did what i had to do. it was my dog... and i killed him... because my dad said i had to be the man. i had to be responsible. still here? just leaving. naomi wants me to come back. she misses you. she just wants me to come back for her, not for me. dell, when a friend asks you to step up, you do it. it's just what you do. you're part of the family. yeah. i'm the part of the family they're embarrassed by. that is not true. you ran away. you got your feelings hurt, and you ran away. now you may have reason, but hiding out here, avoiding your problems, not talking to the people that need you... how are you ever gonna get what you want? talking is important... okay. because when you don't talk, when you don't say what's on your mind - what are you talking about? i meyo, you-youd old me not to talk to you about sam, and when i tried to talk to you about dell, you walkedy.way. bee use you were using measasr.our.dd m i'm yot yodd add,on, not anymore. i used to be, before addison got here. and then you just started... talking to her. you hurt my feelings. and... i know i'm a therapist, and i'm supposed to say that it's all right, but it's not all right. and you can't just make me your addison again and think that makes it all better. work it out with addison. and for god sake, stop sleeping with sam unless you can tell him how wrong this all is, his stealing your job and using you as a sounding board. and then come talk to me... when you want to talk to me. you came back. yeah. so is this the new you? you gonna hide out and do surgery and leave your old friends behind? i wish i felt like my old friends were my old friends. you did what you had to, telling sam, breaking your word to naomi. i never said that. i thought i should say that. thanks. please well, this is nice. it's nice, yeah. us... as friends. now that we're past all that, you know, awkwardness. yeah. it's good. and if we keep at it for a few months, we could be old friends. dell. yeah. i hear you're in charge now. what's this? it's a list of demands- what i need to come back. patients? supervised. i need the hours for my midwife's license. sorry, no. sam. hey, he walked out. and it's been worse since he's been gone. no. we can't afford it. can you give us a minute, please? naomi, we can't add staff- i am talking now. you took my job. you went behind my back, conspired with my best friend, took over the practice, and now you think you can just unilaterally make decisions, or worse-run ideas by me like none of it ever happened. well, guess what, sam? i don't want to hear your ideas. i'm not your sounding board, and i am not going to help you. you find somebody else. at least i was smart enough to find the person who is standing right outside your door. you start today. you see patients only supervised by naomi or addison or pete, and we see. i can live with that. you resume being office manager. vendors, filing, equipment leasing, scheduling, ordering supplies- that's yours. that's what i need from you. and one last demand. it's not on the list. i want scrubs in a better color. i'm a man. i'm not wearing those damn pink scrubs. welcome back, dell. good. you're here. can you get your clothes off? what's wrong? nothing. there's something wrong. i can tell. we don't do the talking thing, cooper. yes, we do. you yelled at me. you confirmed i had a big head. it made me feel better. let me yell at you, make you feel better. i'm not letting you get a piece of this until you start talking. i offered addison a job... and she turned me down. can you take your clothes off now? you like knives. i like guns. centered? wow. all that not talking... talking is overrated.
