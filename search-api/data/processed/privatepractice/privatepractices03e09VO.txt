ultrasound, a follow-up. - Wow... - I know. Others have built up a cerebral spinal fluid... Doctors split on what to do here. Some say wait as long as possible to take the baby then clear once it's out and possibly rupture the mother's uterus. And that's the other camp, they say deliver the baby now. - Twenty three weeks is way too soon. - Or terminate. Eleanor and her husband didn't know what to do, so they called me, and I called you to break the tie. - That's the husband. - Hi, Ronald. This is the doctor I was telling you about. Hi, Addison Montgomery. Thank you so much for coming. My wife and I a little freaked a lot freaked, actually. We look at the scan, at the baby's head... And she's in there praying that you're not gonna tell us to give up. Let's, uh, take a look and we'll talk after, okay this is my wife... Eleanor. Sync by rehelen - corrected by chamallow35 - Well, maybe this is my penance for pushing. - El. I never thought I'd have a child until I met Ron, and then we just both thought, why not? - Why not try for everything? - So it was a year of looking for an egg donor, three cycles of IVF. Now look. Just look. What were we thinking? Congenital hydrocephalus isn't necessarily correlated with a mother's age. - "Necessarily" being the operative word. - It's a waste of time to feel guilty. This is our baby. This is our chance. If Eleanor were to stay here and be monitored, would it be safe for her to continue with the pregnancy? I wouldn't, but there could be another option. I might be able to do what's called an in-utero intracranial septostomy. Meaning I'd go in through the uterus and into the baby's brain, create a hole between the ventricles. That would drain some of the fluid - and relieve the pressure. - Brain surgery while the baby's inside me? Is that... safe? He means, is it safe for a woman my age? Maya. I'm leaving now if you want a ride to school. I'll catch the bus. All right. Sit near the emergency exit. Love you. Bye. Oh... What the hell is that? Um... clothes and makeup. And you were just gonna wait until I left so you could go to school dressed like that? This is how all Girls dress. Not this girl. You have five seconds to get upstairs, wash your face and put on something decent. We'll discuss how long you're grounded later. You're ruining my life. What did you say? Excuse me. What did you say? Nothing! She's 60 years old, Addison. The risks of major surgery... stroke, arrhythmia, getting her off the ventilator... they're all much higher. It's still the best option. For the baby, maybe. But not for Eleanor. If we try to string this out and bring it closer to viability, it is not just the baby that could be in trouble, Pete. I mean, you saw the scan. She's got, like, a little time bomb in her uterus. Then we should advise them to terminate and try again. And what are the odds of that happening? They could use a surrogate or adopt. You think somebody's gonna give a 60-year-old woman a baby? You think Eleanor's too old to a parent? I think it's a little weird to introduce your prom date to your 80-year-old mother. That's one of the downsides of getting good at fertility treatment. Everyone thinks they should be able to have their own baby, - even at 60. - I don't know. Maybe this child just wasn't meant to be. Not my b... not our... not Lucas. A patient. She's 60 and pregnant. Oh. Well, if she's happy sending her husband out for dentures and diapers, then more power to her. Yeah, well, the husband's 30. Even more power to her. Now wait a minute. When Pete was dating younger woman, - you said it was disgusting. - Don't bring me into this. No, I'm just pointing out that Violet has a double standard. There is a stigma attached to dating older women, so I figure if a guy does, he's in it for the right reasons. Oh, right. Lunch. Uh... Pete, this is my father, the captain. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. And, uh, this is, uh... Oh, hi. Sorry. Not at all. See? It is disgusting. Come on, let's go. - I almost killed your child today. - Oh, so today she's my child. No, you would've had to bury her body in secret - to keep me from going to jail. - Okay, what'd she do? She tried to sneak out of the house dressed up like some 25-year-old I don't know what. You remember when she used to put on your lipstick... - Sam, she's not 4, and this is not sweet. - Oh, come on now, Nai. Don't "nai" me. She was trying to pull one over on me. And then when I called her on it, she stomped away - and slammed the door, in my house. - You said you almost killed her, right? I am not gonna let our daughter turn into one of those snot-nosed private school kids who just thinks that they can do whatever they want. That is not Maya. - Well, apparently, we don't know Maya. - Well, try not to get yourself all worked up. Sam, she is hiding things from me, which means she doesn't trust me or she is doing something that she knows is wrong. And you think this is more than her - just putting on some skimpy clothes? - I don't know. I don't know, but I'm gonna turn her room upside down until I figure out exactly what's going on. Well, uh, Ruthie looks fine. How are you doing? - Great. - Yeah, you got these two little ones and 4 others at home under, what, 8, - and you're... you're great, huh? - I'm very blessed. Doesn't mean you can't complain. - Tell me you're exhausted. - Oh, I gave up on sleep a long time ago. I mean, you got no time to yourself or... It's, uh, Shimmon. - Yeah, it's your husband? - He's not... interested. Oh, uh, okay. Well, that, uh, that happens. Some men feel awkward with their wives during or sometimes even after pregnancy, but it passes. Dr. Freedman, I shouldn't be talking to you about this. - It's not proper. - If there's a problem... It's not proper, and, uh, I don't think you can help. I need your help. If you knew somebody was admiring you, specifically your ass, would that just be flattering, or would that get you aroused? 'Cause I think that would be arousing, right? - Yeah. - To know that somebody right near you is thinking about you sexually? Wait, who are we talking about, me or you? W... we're talking about y... you, right? You asked me to help you with something? Oh, yeah. Um, a patient. Two months postpartum, and she's concerned 'cause her husband is not interested in sex. Oh, well, could be depression, stress, performance anxiety. Unless it's vascular disease, hyperthyroidism, iatrogenic impotence. Forget where my office is, Coop, the one with all the marital aids - and books you sneak in to look at during lunch? - No, I was just... Referring a patient to Violet you should be referring to me because you're still mad and petty. Pettiness aside, there's no reason to jump to physiology. I mean, sex issues, more often than not, are rooted in emotional dysfunctions. Yes. Actually, we're finding more and more that problems in the bedroom stem from hormonal imbalances, nerve problems, all kinds of equipment failure. Ok, you know what? I would like to see her alone first. I thought we were one big team here at OWG. Or is that only when you want in on other people's patients? So how exactly do you see this working? Having an awkward lunch together every few days that it takes you three vodka tonics to get through and me a half a bottle of wine at night to forget? Addison, please. I enjoyed seeing your office. Violet's ass or the whole thing? I'd like to see your house. So we could sit there and stare at each other, see who blinks first without even a waiter to break the tension? No. You working on anything interesting? I'm just... I'm trying, Addison. I might be doing an in-utero intracranial septostomy. Really? Trick there is getting a good angle on the foramen of monro. Right. And then finding the avascular plane of the septum. Yes. Yeah. So would you go to the contralateral ventricle first? Mom. What are you doing home? I don't know who you are... But you should leave. Yes, ma'am. Mom? Don't... Talk. One... Two... Mom, what are you gonna do? Three... four... Mom, why are you counting? Five... I am trying to calm myself down. Six... Seven... - It's not working. - Mom... Call your father. Tell him to come here now and save your life. It's not the first time Shimmon hasn't been interested after we've had a baby, but it's lasting longer this time. And I started thinking... - Does your husband f... - How often do you and your husband... Okay, well, other than the lack of interest, have you noticed anything else different about your husband? Well, like what? Is he emotionally distant? Not at all. Shimmon's wonderful. - Oh. Oh, good. - Well, have you noticed... - Any physical changes? - Well, he hasn't been sleeping well, so he's always up poking around the fridge with weird cravings. And, well, maybe I'm imagining it, - but up here... - Getting a little flabby? - It's the couvade. - What's that? Well, sometimes a woman's pregnancy causes changes in her partner's hormones. His testosterone gets converted to oestrogen. It's a sympathetic reaction, so his symptoms mimic yours. - But it's easily treatable... - Cognitive behavioral therapy... Androgen supplementation. Either way, we can help you get Shimmon charged right back up. I'm sorry. Maybe I'm not being clear. That's not what I want at all. I love my husband. I love being intimate with him. But I can't have him charged back up. I thought you wanted help with your sex life. We have six kids who I adore. But if I have to raise or Shimmon has to provide for any more... We can't use birth control, but we can't have more kids. So this couvade, is there any way to keep it going permanently? She wants you to keep him tam - and you're okay with that? - Well, people have meaningful relationships without hang sex. And yet, when they're not having it, it's usually a sign that there's a problem, isn't it? - You asked me to help, Cooper. - No, actually, I asked Violet to help. And I don't think that what Rachel needs right now is for you to bring her back in and start tossing around words like "oral" and "anal." Well, personally, I don't think Rachel needs to give up sex at all. I mean, why should a woman who's feeling something not act on it? No matter how deeply she tries to bury her feelings, eventually, they're gonna come back, right? I think we need to convince her that it's okay - to use birth control. - Well, I agree, but I don't think she's going there. I think we're missing a major part of this equation. Sex... guy involved. - Or at least there's supposed to be. - You know, he's right. - We should get Shimmon to help. - But if Rachel won't talk to a man, would Shimmon talk to a woman? Well, then even if the buildup of CSF is significant, - you can still get complete resolution. - Ideally, yes. Uh... -So... -I have a patient, and, um, then I have to go to the hospital after that. So thank you for lunch. Okay. Oh, hello. Dr. Montgomery. W... captain. Captain. She was here - ditching school on her back with some boy. - His name is Dink. - You told me that you two were just friends. - Wait a minute. Wait. What, what, you... you knew about this Dink? Uh, not... not much. I-I know that she likes him and that he's in the band. He's in a you told me he was in the band. - You two aren't... - Having sex? - No! - So you say. How are we supposed to trust you, Maya, when you go and you do something like this and you show such poor judgment? - So having a boyfriend counts as poor judgment? - Yes. Did I say you could have a boyfriend? Did I say you could talk to boys? - Did I say you could even be around a boy? - Okay, l... calm down. - All right, let's just try to discuss this rationally. - That's fine with me. Mom is the one that's getting all worked up. Maya. Maybe if you had a boyfriend... - What? I will... I... I will kill this child, Sam. - Don't... no, she... You... you better go upstairs and pack a bag. - What? - Go upstairs and pack a bag... now. Okay, don't worry. All right? I... I got this. Um, I'll bring her over to my house for a couple of days. You've been doing all the parenting. It's my turn. Thank you. I... I... I got this. Yeah, you better have it, Sam. This is our child. - What's bradycardia? - It means that the baby's heart rate has slowed down. Nobody said anything about the heart. It's a side effect of increased cranial pressure. How dangerous is it? Your baby isn't going to make it to viability. We either need to perform the septostomy or terminate the pregnancy. I'm sorry. I'm worried about you. Let's just worry about the baby. How soon can you operate? I should do this more often. Anytime. Mm. I'm sorry. - I can't. I can't. - You don't need to say anything. It's just been a long time, you know, since I felt this way. You know, I've been stuck in my head for so long, the idea that I have a body, that I could be touched... Do you mind my scar? Not at all. I can't look at it. Then don't. It'll fade. And in the meantime, let e a reminder that... You went through something no one else quite understands and survived... And that you... you earned the right to do exactly what you want for a while, whether it's this or... anything else. I'm afraid Addison's gonna hate me. You'll be in good company. Do you think there's any way to explain it to her that she'd understand? Emotional discussions are not our forte, so I don't know. That'sad. It is. I was always... working, traveling when Addison had this or that going on. No one event I missed looms large, but in the aggregate, I suppose I... lost track of her, of who she is anyway. But you're here now trying. I guess I should just try harder. Well, ybe if you saw her more here... In her element... That might make it easier. It might be good for both of you. Maya's being stupid. - Well, she's a teenager. - If you take her side in this, - I swear, I will take my chocolate and I will leave. - I am not. I am on your side, Nai... for what it's worth. I mean, honestly, you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who knows less about functional parent-child relationships. What, is the captain that bad? He says heants to spend time with me, but he doesn't know how to spend time with me. We talked about surgery. He lectures, and I pretend to not already know what he's telling me. I should just send him home, let him and Bizzy clank around in that empty house in wasp-y silence. Yeah, well, sitting around in your empty house, you start to have doubts. Will you please tell me that I am doing the right thing? You are doing the right thing, Nai. I don't mean to disturb you. - Naomi. - Captain, how are you? I came to ask a favor. I was hoping I could observe you perform the septostomy. You want to watch... Me? I've never seen you work. I know your reputation, of course, but, uh... I'd like to see it, to see... you. Okay. If it's not an imposition... Just take yes as an answer. Look, I work two jobs six days a week, and Rachel is consumed. She makes our home, she juggles schools and doctors and meals and birthdays... So many things, I lose track. Exactly, so at a certain point, whether it's 7 or 9 or 12 kids, do you think you'll want to stop? The torah tells us "to be fruitful and multiply," fill the earth and subdue it. We interpret that to mean that we can't do anything to try to prevent a pregnancy. I love my wife. And neither one of us wants to give up... you know... What if we could find something that wasn't technically birth control? Uh... We have chosen to be faithful, Dr. Freedman. Who would we be fooling? People are unpredictable. - Look, Addison... - Just when you think you know someone, - they go ahead and do something nice. - Wait, what? My father. He wants to watch me do surgery. I mean, the man never made a single piano recital, tennis match... nothing my whole life. - And suddenly... - That's... that's great. Violet, look, I know that you think people can change, but do you really think the captain... Hey, Pete. Yeah, of course. - I'll be right down. - Uh-huh. Okay. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Nothing is wrong with me. I'm normal. I just... I just did something normal. Congratulations. No, really. I, um... I slept with someone. I didn't think I would, but then I did. And it was... normal. I didn't even think I cared anymore, but then I slept with the captain, and it was the most normal thing I've done since the attack. Did I just say his name out loud? Because I was thinking it, - and then I just... yeah, I said it out loud. - So all that about getting your needs met... No, no, no. This was not about sex. It was... it was good. Except for the part where you committed adultery with your friend's father. We need a rabbi. She's 15 years old, all right? She's becoming her own person. We gotta give her room. Room to what, roll around on the couch with some boy named Dink? Well, maybe we should meet him, you know, - see what kind of a guy he is. - He's the kind of guy - who had his hands all over your daughter's... - Oh, hey, hey, hey. Hey, do you remember what you were like when you were his age? Oh, yeah, well, you're... you're not a good example, but this Dink person, he looks like a scruffy little hormone. Okay, I will talk to her about him. Talking's good, but yelling's fine, too. She's gotta feel like she can trust us. She needs to know that she cannot cross us. We've gotta hold the line, Sam. Tough but fair. All right, well, when in doubt, you... Channel me. That's worked out well. You need to talk her out of it, Dr. Montgomery. I know what we said, but... when I look at you and I think about what they're about to do... We don't have to do this. If you want to save the baby, Eleanor has to have surgery. I'm scared, too, Ronnie. But this our baby. Okay, maybe it's not my egg, but it's got your DNA. Honey, it's your child. It's not that I don't love it. I do. But ght now... I love you more. I can't even think about losing you. But you will. We're never gonna have the kind of time that other couples have together. And after I'm gone, you're gonna have this... to remember what we had and what we were together. Look, I get that you want what's best for Eleanor, but if you do what's best for the baby, I think I can give you both. Ronnie, please. Okay. Okay. Violet slept with Addison's father. She... I thought you'd want to know. Why would she do that? Why would she tell you? Some people can talk to me. Oh. I'm trying to tell you things, like you wanted. Gossiping about who's sleeping with whom is not want I wanted. Where are we, Cooper, you and me? I don't know. Okay, hold on, baby. Sit still. I wish she could give the baby a paralytic to slow everything down. Can't because of Eleanor's age. Well, you could. I would. I've learned... don't second guess her. Well, I... I didn't mean to, but that's not you. You're... you're being protective. I can only imagine what she's said about me. She hasn't, not much anyway. Are you two... close? We are. Um, not like that. I'm with Violet. Well, I was with Vi... well... We recently had a baby together, so we're... Well, I don't know what we are. - Well... - Okay, I'm in at... 2 millimeters. Get ready to inflate. Okay, go. You ever seen Addison do surgery before? Not since she was a kid. Uh, when she was 8 or 9, she used to love to come to the university with me. She'd sit in the back of my class cutting on a hot dog while my other students worked on their cadavers. - She always wanted to impress me. - With a hot dog? You ever try to take the casing off in one piece? It's like separating the dura from the cerebral cortex. She's gotten good at it, clearly. Damn it. The opening's closing up. Stay and visualize... then reinflate. Come on, Addie. She will. Okay, repositioning. Come on. Okay. We're back in at the original incision. Inflate the balloon to 3 millimeters... Now. Come on. Hold. Hold. Good. Got it. Camera. She's got it. She's good. Okay, let's prepare to close. It's a mitzvah, guys. Married people are supposed to be having sex. Whether or not they're trying to have kids? Absolutely. Judaism is unique among the major world religions in that it promotes sex not just for procreation but for pleasure. You see? You should come to shul more often. You'd learn all sorts of good things. That's good. Sex is good. But even if people are just having sex for pleasure, - babies happen. - And you want to know about birth control. You should read the story of onan. We're pretty down on anything that has to do with - destruction of the seed. - Well, the pill doesn't technically destroy any seed. You're right. It... it's all about interpretation. Depending upon how observant they are, some Jews feel that if you've had at least one boy and one girl, you've been fruitful enough. Others take a harder line. So with the hard-liners, is there any kind of loophole? Isn't there a mercy clause in Judaism for parents who have already filled up the minivan but still want to keep doing those... those mitzvahs? Look, rabbis have been debating these rules - for hundred of years. - So can't we find one who would let 'em use birth control? Sure, but it doesn't sound like your patients are looking to end-run the lord. They sound like they want to live by the letter of the law. Congratulations. Thank you. Your work is... elegant. I was glad to be here. I was glad you were. Look, if, um... If you still want to see my house, I mean, you could come over tonight for a drink... Uh, sure. I love hanging out with you. And I love rainbow sprinkles. But are you gonna pick me up from school every day? - You can trust me, you know. - I want to. I really do, but... I know, the Dink thing wasn't good. I should've just told mom about him. But she's so judgmental. Hey. She's supposed to be. We both are. I think you'd really like him. Dink is... amazing. Amazing, huh? All right, I think I should meet him then. You totally should. He'll think you're cool. - All my friends do. - Really? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so let's make a deal. Uh, you tell me everything you do, with whom and where, and I will treat you like you know right from wrong. Okay. Okay? All right. I'm excited about this, living with you. - Aren't you? - I am. Mm-hmm. Go ahead. You can get that. What, is that your, uh, your B.F.F. making you L.O.L.? Right? Daddy, please don't do that. So... he came and watched my surgery. You know, I was afraid he was gonna do something awful, like make some big speech about upholding the Montgomery name or some snarky postmortem, but... he didn't. He called it elegant. It was nice. - What? - Oh, boy. - What? - Don't hate me, Addie. I am your friend. I am your friend who slept with your brother and didn't tell you, and I know what that did to you, and I want to be your friend and I don't want - to keep secrets from you... - Oh, my God, Nai. You slept with the captain. - No, no, Addie. No, I wouldn't. - Oh, okay. Thank God. Okay, for a minute, you scared me there. - I thought... - Violet slept with him. And... and Violet told Charlotte, and Charlotte told Cooper, and then Sam read it all over Cooper's face, and then he didn't know if you wanted to know, so he asked me, and I... I'm sorry, Addie. I couldn't not tell you. You need to just let it go, Addie. Okay? It's not about you. Hey. You look wiped. You should go home and pour yourself a glass of wine. - Yeah, well, a glass of wine's not going to help. - Yeah, Pete's right, Addie. You should... you should go. Yeah. Is it Eleanor? She's having these stomach pains. - Her sats are dropping. - What's wrong? Let's take a look here. What's happening to her? - Free fluid in her abdomen. - The uterus is almost empty. There's leaking around the site of the incision. The baby's in distress. Okay, Eleanor. We need to go back in and repair the defect and then we will infuse fluid back into your uterus. - Please... save the baby. - Let's go. Save them both. Focus on the uterine incision. We need to localize the leak. Tissue's not as resilient as it was when she was younger. - Couldn't hold the seal. - Okay, grab the suction irrigator. Her respiratory rate is up and her sats are dropping again. - She's going into failure. - She's fluid overloaded. We need to get the amniotic fluid out of her belly. 500 cc's. Okay, we need to stabilize her cardiac function. Give her 40 of lasixs. I need to get a patch in now. Foam? Blocks sperm. I.U.D.? If they ever do want to have kids again, - it wouldn't be my first choice. - How does the female condom work exactly? - Cooper. - No, really. It's like a big, flappy, messy mystery. We have to be able to find something here. We can't just preach abstinence. What? It's just like... you're just, like, all about the sex, - just, like, with whomever, whenever... - Cooper. Whatever the age difference. I mean, how long do I have to pretend that I don't know that you slept with Addison's father? Look, I'm happy about this. - I think it was... I think it was really good for me. - That's good. Good for you. But, you know, telling people things, telling the truth, it's important. And that's a lesson that the women in this room could learn. Are you done with your lecture? - 'Cause it's not getting us anywhere with the Golds. - Yeah, it really should not be this hard. Well, it's not. It's the one time we have a magic pill. Doesn't take a genius to pop one of these every morning. Salt, water, little bit of oestrogen... If it didn't say "birth control" on the side, the Gold would be fine with it. I think we should ask them to come back in. Ronnie. You're okay, El. Oh. You're okay. Would you like to see your baby? The head... it's perfect. I can't believe I almost... - I almost took this away from us. - But you didn't. When things got hard, you acted like a father. - Addison? - I gotta go. Excuse me. Addison, hey. You want to talk about it? No. Yes and no. My father slept with Violet. I know. Maya. - Hey, dad. - Hey, I got this from your fridge, doc. Hope you don't mind. Hi, Dr. Bennett. I'm Dink... - I know who you are. - You said you wanted to meet him. Get out of my house. - Go upstairs and put on some clothes. - Daddy... Get your behind upstairs. Okay, everybody, this party's over. Don't bother cleaning up. - Daddy, can I just exp... - This party is over! Do you want me to explain? No. I think things happen for a reason, Pete. And sometimes you don't see them coming. Sometimes you don't think they could come. But they do. And I hope you're not upset, because... I'm not ashamed. I'm hopeful, actually, and... Stop talking, Violet. You're talking as if I care, as if it concerns me. But what you do... I don't care anymore. I'm done. We have all sorts of ways to help you... devices, counseling... if and when you decide to avail yourselves of it. But ultimately, this isn't a medical decision. It's a personal one. So that's it? Shayna. Uh, Rachel. Um, so Dr. Freedman told me how exhausted you are. I'll be okay. Well, you're probably just anemic. It's very common in young mothers. - Uh, this should help. - Is that... Among other things, it treats iron deficient anemia. So if you feel like you need it, that would be up to you. Okay, guys. Let's go. Are we ready? Come on. Come on, come on. - Bye. - Bye. Sometimes you don't tell the person you le something to protect 'em. I have a question for you. When you slept with my father, when you helped him cheat on my mother, uh, what did you say to him to make him - behave actually like a human being? - Addison, he is a human being. - Are you that gullible, lonely? Is that it? What is it? - It wasn't like that. So then what was it like? Tell me, because of all the faceless, nameless women he's rolled around with, you're the first one I can actually ask. Okay, um, if you... if you really want to know, it was, um... it was wonderful. No, I'm... I'm sorry if... if that hurts you or if it doesn't jibe with how you see him, but he was kind and caring. He was a real gentleman. He helped me. He's the first person in a long time that made me feel normal. And maybe I was wrong for doing it, maybe we both were, but he's not a bad person. - And I didn't mean to hurt you, Addison... - Well, but you did it anyway. Well, you told Pete. Did you mean to hurt him? That's different. But you did it anyway. - Get out. - But, daddy, I don't think... Get out of this car, go in the house apologize to your mother and mean it, because if you screw up again... She will kill you. And I will help her hide the body this time. So... go. I love her, but, man, sh... I know. What are we gonna do, Sam? - What if she keeps this up? What's the next step? - We gotta stay tough... stay together on this. Addison? I have tolerated them. I may not have forgiven you, but I have tolerated them all. This is different. - She's a consenting adult. - No, she is not. In addition to being my friend and my colleague, - Violet is damaged. - I understand that's how you see her... - You took advantage. - I don't think Violet feels taken advantage of. She doesn't. She called you a gentleman. She said that you were wonderful to her. You know, and as bad as I've felt about myself for covering for you for all of these years, and as depressg as it is to watch Archer follow in your footsteps... Nothing compared to hearing that, because it made me wonder, daddy. Why is it that you can be so good to every woman in the world except Bizzy and me? Especially when we're the ones that love you the most. Bizzy, hi. Listen, if you don't come out
