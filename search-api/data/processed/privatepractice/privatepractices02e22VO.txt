breakfast. We won't discuss it now, but I am looking forward to hearing where you are on my offer. - We're still having dinner tonight? - I'll be there. Good. Come on in. He's meeting with everyone... - everyone except me. - You have a contract. - He can't push you out. - I'm trying to talk to you about what's going on. - It's Violet... again. - Grasshopper! - Cooper. - Grasshopper! You grasshoppered me, right? It's the baby...? It's the bug...? The bug... Okay... so now we're gonna breathe? We're gonna breathe now. I know, I know. This is your case. I am not hovering. I just wanted to see how she's doing. We're gonna find out. - This is it, Pete. - It's happening. Not happening today. No cervical dilation. - You're not in labor, Violet. - What? I am a doctor. - I know labor when I feel labor. - You... know psychosis. But... - labor, not so much. - Addison? He's right. I gotta go. I gotta go prep another patient. This chicken is cooked. This bug is ready to be served. This baby boy has got to get out of me. I am a week overdue. You just... you have to give him a little more time. He'll be here. The baby! - Is it here? - It's a false alarm. I brought this. Kids love pigs. That's really sweet, Sheldon. I'm sure he's gonna love it. Private Practice S02E22 Yours, mine and ours</i> Well, you two are having fun. We're just comparing notes... same checkups, same implantations, same symptoms. Why don't you come on back, and we'll go over your C.V.S. results? And, Zoe, you'll be next. Take your time. I'm waiting on my husband. God, that feels good, whatever that is. Good. Good. Do it more. - So you're feeling better? - What do you mean? Since your loss. My loss? - The baby. The miscarriage. - Oh, that. No, I'm fine. I'm doing great. So... Dr. Turner's been helping you through your grief? Grief? What grief? There's no grief. I mean, there was, but... but there isn't anymore. I just changed my way of thinking. It's a celebration, really. I made life. I mean, yes, the baby died, but that doesn't change the fact that life was made, which is the real miracle, making life. I mean, labor's hard. It... hurts and... and at least I don't have to go through that. Katie, I'm really glad you're feeling better, but recovery is an ongoing process, and it's important for you to remember to follow the regimen that Dr. Turner and I laid out for you. That means taking your medications, because with your history of mental health issues, you don't want to backslide into delusions. Look at me, Dr. Wilder. I am smiling again. - So he's fine? - Yeah. I keep calling it a "he" because of Vic. He really wanted a boy. You know, someone to carry on the family name. Not that he wouldn't have loved a girl, too. I like to think he's watching from heaven. Oh, he is. This was your dream, right? This is what you and Vic wanted. He'd want you to have this baby. I'll... be right back in one second, okay? Just give me a minute. What's up? Okay, that's it. Cerclage is out. Hard part's over. You can deliver anytime now. - Dizzy. - Oh, that's... probably a mild stress reaction. Just stay here for a couple of hours and rest until it subsides. I'm gonna go back to the hospital, check on some patients, and I'll pick you up in a few hours, okay? Thanks for... for everything. I saw that. I saw the way you looked at him, the way he looked at you. - Morgan, I... - Are you sleeping with Noah? Morgan just asked me point-blank if I was sleeping with Noah. I mean, I told her no, I'm not, because I'm not. I'm barely in the same room since... - What? What? What? - I was just in with Amelia Sawyer, and I started going over the C.V.S. results, and the baby tested positive for the beta thalassemia trait. - That's just a marker. - I know, but Amelia isn't a carrier. And neither was her husband. We screened. And... so I checked the I.F. records to see who else I implanted that day. I implanted Zoe Salter that morning. Zoe is a carrier for beta thalassemia. Oh, my God. - How? - I don't know. - How?! - I don't know how. I don't know. But... Amelia's embryo is inside of Zoe, and Zoe's embryo is inside of Amelia. They're carrying each other's baby. - You switched them? - This is a disaster. Wait a minute. Why assume it was my fault? You're the one who delivers the syringes for the implantations. You've been walking around here unfocused, not giving a damn. There are steps to the process, okay? Multiple steps. And in the end, Naomi injects them. I'm not saying it was you. I'm not saying it was you. I'm just saying, we don't know. Hey, he's right. I am the doctor. Ultimately, this is my responsibility. But listen, we should be focused on these women and... not - pointing fingers. - I cannot imagine what it feels like. It's hard enough to carry your own baby. Imagine carrying somebody else's. I suppose they could decide to terminate, start over. No, this is amelia's last embryo with her dead husband's sperm. This is it. There are no do-overs. This is a nightmare... lawsuits, our reputation. I'm gonna call our lawyer, start trying to do damage control. - All right, I'll call Duncan. - Duncan? Yeah, medical malpractice is his specialty, and... - and he's someone we can trust. - He's someone you can trust. - I'll go ahead and call him. - I said I'd call him. As head of the practice, I think the call should come from me. I'll call him on the way to the hospital. This isn't my baby? - How can this not be my baby? - I know this is difficult to digest, and I wish I didn't have to tell you this. Words cannot convey how sorry I am, and... there's no explanation I can offer you that can excuse what's happened. I can't believe this. This isn't happening. We've spent two years trying to get pregnant, and now... This isn't my baby? You're telling me that this isn't... This isn't my pregnancy? I saw the waddler walking into her office. I assume the grasshopper was a false alarm. I should've called you. I got caught up with some patients, and... - we got some stuff going on here. - You'll make it up to me. I need you to be my beard. William left again without talking to me, but I found out where he's gonna be later. I'll bump into him, start a conversation, - impress him. - Stalk him. What do I ever ask from you, Coop? A little slap, a little tickle, repeat as necessary. I even let you live with another woman. So you want to make an issue of this, or you want to help me? What time should I be there? It's you, isn't it? You're... carrying my baby. Amelia, maybe let's give Zoe some time... I know this is so awful, but at least it's you. We can do it, right? We can do this? I'll respect your wishes about the baby, about everything. And I'll trust you with mine. Amelia, I c... I can't. We have other embryos stored. - We're gonna start over. - No, that's my baby. You can't... I don't have any other eggs. - I'm carrying your baby. - I don't want that. I... We want you to fix this mistake. What? You want me to kill the baby? I can't do that. You can't do that. Why don't we all just go back into my office - and discuss this? - No, I just want to go home. I want a lot of things. Please... I won't do this. I will not end this pregnancy. And if you do anything to that baby, I'm gonna have this baby, and I'm gonna keep it! Hey. I saw Katie this morning. I'm worried she's off her meds. Katie? Oh, no. She's been really compliant. I mean, she's cheerful, which is a concern, but... Not cheerful. She's euphoric. She's talking about her miscarriage with excitement. Well, we have a session this afternoon. I'll talk to her about it then. Thanks. She still hasn't given me an answer to my proposal. This is awkward, between us. - I mean, I like you. I do, Pete. - Are you gonna propose to me? You... you're funny. I bet she likes that. I guess... Whichever way this turns out, I'll know. I'll know I tried. We have done nothing wrong. Nothing biblical anyway. - Well, there's coveting. - Okay, coveting. - But that's not the bad sin. - There are no good sins. Are you even religious? - Then why are we talking about sins? - You're the one who brought up - the bible. - I did not. It doesn't matter who brought it up, okay? Because... We're both going to hell. What? I feel guilty. I feel... Awful. Which is why I should tell her. You know, this... - this will destroy her life. - But at least it'll be honest, and she deserves the truth. We could be together. Think about that. We could be together. I covet you. I... covet you. I'm not the kind of guy who fights. I just... don't see the point to it. And the times I've tried it, you hurt your knuckles, you don't really feel better, it doesn't solve anything. And I guess I'm, at heart, just a pacifist, 'cause I think fighting is stupid, I think war is wrong, and taking up arms for some cause just lacks nobility in today's world. So... I'm not the kinda guy who fights, but I should've fought for you. I should've fought for you, Violet. And I don't really know how else to say it except... I want your kid, whether it's mine or not. And... I want your body, whether it's pregnant or not. And I want your heart, whether I have to fight for it or not. And I should've fought for it, but I was... confused and angry and... scared. So... I am fighting now... because I love you. And I think we can be something. I think we can be a family. I'm... I'm fat and overdue and tired and cranky No, Pete. I'm sorry. This is not what I want. Year ago, I was stalking a man who wanted nothing to do with me, and now I'm turning two good men down. Do I hate myself? Is it me? Is it? Am I the problem? Do you think you're the problem? Oh, that's very therapeutic, making the patient answer her own question. And now I'm avoid it. Okay, do you think one of them... Pete or Sheldon... do you think that could work? You have to answer that one. - I don't know, Cooper! - Well... Dr. Turner. Hi. No one was up front. It's time for my appointment, right? I think your focus needs to be on damage control. First, you want to mitigate pain and suffering. So... approach each woman separately about a settlement. Offer to cover all medical expenses and make a large, lump-sum payment in exchange for releasing all claims and signing a confidentiality agreement. You need to show these women that someone has paid for the mistake. You need to fire Dell. No... Dell... is like family, and... we don't even know that this is his fault. You want to defend him? Fine. But I do not believe that this was you. Dell is family, but if saving the practice means cutting him loose, then... Are you firing me? No, but for now, you're behind a desk, - phones and mail only. - But I have patients. I'm... delivering Violet's baby. Dell... it's... It's just for now. So I spoke with Dr. Wilder, and... - we have some concerns. - Is it a boy or a girl, your baby? Katie, your... medication is a very important part of managing your delusional disorder. It's important that you keep taking it. Does she kick much? I'm sorry. You were voicing your concerns, and I wasn't answering. I am taking my meds. I don't want things to go back to the way they were, Dr. Turner. It was crazy. I was crazy. I'm taking my meds and I'm feeling great. Can I touch it? I don't think that's a good idea, Ka... The baby's moving. Oh, it's a smart baby. You can just tell. Is it a boy or a girl? - So you agree, she's of her meds? - Yeah, I think she's off her meds. I think she's lying about it. I don't have any proof. I'd like to 51-50 her. I just... I... I think she's on the edge. I got a bad feeling about this. You can't commit someone on a feeling. But it really creeped me out, the way she was looking at me. Pete's right. You can't commit someone on a feeling. What if the delusions are amping up again? What if she's just happy? - She's done grieving. - I know happiness when I see it. What? You know happiness? When it's offered to you? We are talking about Katie. She may just be happy. She wasn't happy. I know happy. I wanted to apologize for this morning. Don't. No. - You... didn't do anything. - I thought. Well, I thought I saw something. But now I realize I was just jumping to conclusions. And... You reassured me, and I trust you. I went by the birthing suite and... Can we talk a minute? No, it's okay, Addison. I insulted her this morning after you left. I was feeling insecure about you, and I insulted her. I just hope she'll still deliver our baby. You didn't do anything. Of course I'm still going to deliver your baby. Family is the most important thing, and... nothing should get in the way of that. William, I am... I am so flattered by the offer, but... something happened today... a very... serious medical error... and... my practice is under fire. So I'm... I'm no longer a good candidate. The measure of a person is not the mistakes they make. It's how they respond to them. I want you. I guess I'm just gonna have to sell you a little harder. May I get you another drink while you wait? Noah was gonna leave his wife... For me. And I... stopped him. And I hate... that I stopped him. And I hate... Myself for feeling that way. Who would've thought that you'd turn out to be the nice guy? Not Violet. Congratulations mama. on popping out the baby, you did pop out that baby, right? 'cause that's the only possible reason I can fathom for uncle Coop to have left me sitting alone like a fool - at a restaurant last night. - I'm sorry. - My fault. I was a wreck. - Clearly. You and I need to talk. I can't talk about this. I have a patient in crisis right now. I can't have this conversation. I'm sorry. What's going on? Is there a problem? The problem, Sam, is that your ex-wife is trying to steal my job. Amelia can't do it, not yet. So... I'm gonna have her talk to Violet instead. Nai, trust me. It would be much better if you would just... - Naomi, we we over this. - I am not gonna force her to talk to an attorney if she's not ready to do it. Well, I think you should bring in another attorney. I'm... not trying to put you in the middle, Duncan. I'll call you later. I hate this. I hate being on opposite sides. Yeah, well, you may hate it, but your side always wins. This isn't about winning, Naomi. I've been offered Charlotte King's job... - At Pacific Wellcare Center. - What? That's crazy. - I mean, you know that, right? - I thought so at first... I thought so at first, too. I did. But, Addison... I'm floundering. This whole year, just... Losing the practice and... Sam... Renting out the fourth floor... I mean, I'm trying to move forward. I am. But I... I haven't, not really. And this offer... - It's exciting. - Nai, you are my best friend. And with everything going on, Addison... Me leaving would show that you did something. This is... your practice. Not anymore. Where's Betsey? - Tell me she's okay. - Yeah, she's fine. She's... She's at a motel with a friend. That's it? You took my daughter in the middle of the night. You... took her, and... and I had no idea where you were, if she was okay, and you just... - You're high, aren't you? - St. Louis was really bad. - I need money. - You think I'm... You think I'm gonna give you money for drugs? I don't need a lecture, okay? I need $10,000. You're insane. Even if I had that kind of money, after everything you've done, you think I'd give it to you? If you give me the money... I'll give you Betsey. Maybe I'm not meant to be a mother. - Maybe I'm not meant to be happy. - I don't... I don't believe that's true. I think everybody's meant to be happy. It's easy for you to say. You're about to - have a baby. - This isn't what you want. I know that, Amelia. But you could carry this child and give it up, and then become a mother another way. NaomI's right. There are other ways. My happiness? It's right here. It's right in front of me. I can't fathom letting it go. I don't know. Maybe you and Sheldon are right. Maybe I don't know how to be happy. For a long time, I've been at baseline... just alive, breathing, heart beating. Happy just seemed really far away. And that was the best I could do. But... I'm... I'm having a baby, Pete. I am making a person, which is a really optimistic thing to do. I mean, that is really happy, which scares me a lot. But... the point is, the... the point... maybe I don't know how to be happy, but I want to learn. I want to be happy, Pete. And you... You... so often... make me happy. So... so I know that I said no, but if you were still willing to fight for me, then I am willing to be fought for. Except it really wouldn't be much of a fight, because you'd win... Be quiet. I have to give Sheldon an answer. I don't want to have any secrets anymore. And then I think I'm just gonna go home and sleep, - 'cause I have not been sleeping at... - What did I say about being quiet? I forgot to tell you that I love you. I think it was my fault... Zoe and Amelia. I checked the calendar, and... my lawyer called that day to tell me that he couldn't find Heather and Betsey. And it was killing me, and... What? Heather's back. She showed up strung out. She'll... give me my daughter if I give her $10,000. You can't buy your daughter. I can't let her run with my child. So then you come running to Naomi after you blamed her for your mistake? - Sam, he apologized. - Of course he apologized. He wants your money. It's not your problem. I'm sorry I asked. I'm sorry I asked. - What is wrong with you? - No, what is wrong with you? You do not buy children, you don't help drug addicts kill themselves, and you do not take the fall for Dell and then flee to... to work for the enemy! How could you not tell me? We were supposed to be partners here. - You're the one who wanted distance. - I said we couldn't be best friends. - I didn't tell you to leave. - You were right. I mean, look... look at how you reacted to Duncan yesterday, Sam. That's... not business. That's you not liking the fact that I'm dating Duncan. - I don't like you dating him! - You know what? But you don't get a say. Why do you get a say? We... we're... not married, Sam. - Why should it matter? - Because I'm still in love with you! Why? What? What do you... what... what, is... that supposed to make me want to stay or is that supposed to make me want to go? - You okay? - I will be. How did you get my address? I'm sorry to bother you at home. I know it crosses a boundary. It's just... I don't want to lie to you. You've helped me so much. I needed to talk to you. I needed to let you know, that I know. What? What is it? You have my baby. And I want it back. Yes, Dr. Turner? What was in the syringe? It doesn't matter what was in the syringe. What matters is, you can't move from the neck down. Did you know you can order drugs from other countries and have them delivered right to your door? The internet is amazing. Katie, we need to talk about this. You've done a very dangerous thing, - so we should discuss your options. - I'm not listening to you anymore. I'm getting my baby out of your body and bringing him home where he belongs. I don't... what are you gonna do, cut him out of my body? Oh, you're scared. I can tell. But don't worry. I read all about it on the internet. The internet... it's amazing. You can even order surgical supplies. Thank you for coming. Martin didn't want me to, but... he doesn't know you. I do. And... I wanted you to know that I'm not a monster. I just... This is my life, and I have dreams, and I have one chance to make them happen, and I can't. I can't turn what I've always wanted into a nightmare. For me, that baby inside you, I thought was my last chance. Only... maybe it's not. I want that baby. But... I can't make you carry him, so... Maybe... maybe the reason this all happened is... is that this... is my new chance. You want to carry your own child. I understand. But this baby... I can't get rid of it. I love him. We all have dreams, and... sometimes they get complicated. And so sometimes we have to stop and... let go of one dream so that we can move forward with another one. I can't. I can't let you keep my child. I'm sorry. I know you're meeting with other doctors. And while Naomi Bennett is an amazing fertility specialist, her track record at running a practice... - This is not about Dr. Bennett. - You're right. It's about whether or not I can give you want you want. If you want to make this the next Mayo, Cleveland, Palo Altclinic, - I can do that. - Really? These are letters of intent from Wilson Stafford, Sanjay Finamore and Joy Hopkins, each one, the best in their field. All it takes is your signature, and I can have them working for us tomorrow. Well, I'll give this some thought. Impressive speech. - Don't try and get in my good graces. - I'm sorry about last night, and I know... I haven't been giving you enough. But listen to this... things are gonna change. Violet - is moving in with Pete. - Every time you had a choice, you chose her. Now she doesn't need you anymore. Well, you know what? Neither do I. I'm sorry. I couldn't. I... I just... She loves you. I couldn't... - I understand. - I can't be this person, you know, a person who does this... - Horrible thing to another woman. - I know. - I know. - I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. We can't. We can't. I love you. If you want me to walk away, I'll walk away. If you want me to stay... It's Morgan. She's in labor. I know you can remember what happened to your baby. Try... try and think. My baby died. That's what you want me to say, right? That's the correct answer? What do you think the correct answer is? My baby didn't die. Yours died, so you took mine. You stole my baby. But your baby was a girl. Mine is a boy. There's a boy in here. I know it sounds crazy. I do. But I'm not crazy. I'm a normal person. I believe it's true. This is my baby. And if I don't follow my instincts and I let you take my baby... Katie, lookt me. Look at me. I believe you... That you think this is your baby. But I think this is my baby, too. It has grown in me for months, and I... and I love this baby. And I know you love this baby, too. So if you cut... Then... the baby might get hurt. And we both love this baby too much to hurt it, right? So let's not do this, not right now. It kicked. It's calling me. My baby's calling me. If you would just wait, maybe... I told you, I'm not crazy. I know I can't wait. I've attacked you in your home. I've drugged you. You think they'll give me my baby after that? Shut up! - I'm sorry. - Katie, please... Oh, God. It'll be better once the baby's out. Once the baby's out, I'll be gone, and you won't have to worry about me anymore. - I'll work fast. - Katie, please... Please. Your family, whatever that means... if you're single, if you're married,</i> if you have kids, or if you want kids...</i> Your family should be the most important thing.</i> And your family is the most... Dr. Bennett. I've been walking around thinking about Amelia and about the baby, and I can't let her keep my child. Just the thought of it... But... maybe you're right about moving forward. And so I'm thinking maybe I can carry Amelia's baby and she can carry mine. I'm upset with you, Dell, for what you did and for the position that you put the practice in, - for how you've been acting... - Sam, just... let me finish. But I know that you've been hurting. And I knowthat when you've lost somebody that you love... I know that you need to do whatever it takes to get them back. $10,000. Get your daughter back. Our baby's coming. He's really coming. How are you feeling? Good. Everything's good, right, Dr. Montgomery? Everything looks fine, yeah. Let's just see how dilated you are. This list... Impressive. Almost... perfect. But if you brought all these doctors here, how long do you suppose they'd last? Your stuff doesn't like you. You use 'em like pawns. The best work is done by people who are inspired, who push themselves because they... they want to be a part of something larger. And you think that Naomi Bennett, or anyone else, is gonna be able to do that for you? The plans I have for this practice... require someone with a heart, Charlotte. Where's the money, Dell? You said you'd give me the money. I need the money. You're not gonna see her again. Look, I have the money, but I'm not gonna give it to you, okay? - And she's not going anywhere. - You don't have custody. - I do. - You're strung out. So I can pick up the phone and I can call D.C.F.S. or I can pick up the phone and I can call the police, and we can have them come down here. You tell me. Look, I am not giving you this money to let you kill yourself, because I may hate you right now, but I love her, and you're her mother, and I am not letting go of my daughter. So come say good-bye to your daughter. Come say good-bye to Betsey. Come say good-bye. Baby... You're gonna have to stay with daddy for a little while, okay? I love you. - I'm gonna get her back. - Mommy! Come here.... It's okay... Violet isn't answering the phone. She came down. I was with a patient. But she left me a note. She said it was important, you know, and I got the sense that's... Have you heard anything from her? - No, not in the last few hours. - It sounded like she had an answer... To my proposal. I'm sure she'll call you back. You know. You know the answer. You should talk to Violet. Take good care of her... of them. Maybe I shouldn't have said what I said about how I feel. That's my issue. It's not yours, and... and I can deal with it. But this... This is our practice. We built it. I can be okay with... with you moving on, but not... not with you leaving. - You are the heart of this place. - I took the job. That's a cop-out. I do not accept it. It's what I have to do. - That was a strong one. - You're doing great. - You okay? - Please don't. Just don't. Okay, I should've asked for drugs. Is it too late for drugs? I'm sorry... Morgan. It is. Here comes another one, Noah! You're doing great. You're doing fine. I can't believe we're finally getting to... After the babies that died, we're actually gonna be a family. Morgan Gellman's in the birthing suite. I need you to go deliver her baby. - What... about no patient con... - Just deliver the baby. I can't. And... I'll be here if you need anything, but I need you to go do this. Betsey, I've got some work to do, okay? But Addison's right here. - Hello. - I need you Cooper. - Yeah, I just got to Violet's, so... - Cooper, I need you. I got fired. Okay, I'll... I'll be right there. He's gone. I'm gonna get started. "Transverse incision..." What? Don't cut there. It's too high. You know no matter where I cut, you won't survive, right? I know. It's for the baby. If you cut there, you'll cut the baby. I know. I'm a doctor. I'm your doctor, Katie. Tell me what to do. Measure two fingers above my pelvic bone. Now what? After... after you get the baby out, you cut that cord right away. You cut it right away. You keep him warm, and you make sure to clear his mouth and his nose. - You promise me you'll do that? - I promise. Tell me. Make a clean slice on the horizontal. You're gonna have to cut through the muscle to get to the baby. I just want to say... I think under different circumstances, we could've been friends. Don't you think?
