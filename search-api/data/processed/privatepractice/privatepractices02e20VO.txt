Who are you going to see? A patient. Who's home on bed rest. Come on. It's... Nai, it's easier for me to go see Morgan Gellman at home than it is for her to come in here. The less that she moves, the better chance she has of keeping the baby. There is nothing going on with me and the husband, okay? This is a professional visit... For serious medical reasons. As long as it's a professional visit for serious medical reasons. I'm responsible for saving that baby's life, Nai. I'm a lifesaver. I'm a doctor. She seems okay now. She paged me on my way in... said she'd already called you. I'm glad that... that... she called. We're trying to be careful. This is a beautiful home. Thanks. Morgan decorated it herself. Her taste is... exquisite. - So we should go on up, and see Morgan. - She would be up... Is it... Height... A thrilling 5 feet even. Weight... a perfectly appropriate 84 pounds. And overall health, as the kids would say, ab fab. The kids don't say that. Really? They don't? They should. It's Gretchen. She just got her braces off. Can I take it? Twelve. Wasn't it, like, a year ago she was carrying around that stuffed unicorn she made everybody pet? Now she's got pierced ears and a cell phone. Given what passes for kids' TV, the internet... What can you do? Speaking of which, I think Sarah needs to see a female doctor. Are you uncomfortable with me examining Sarah, or is she? It's not that. It's... I need someone to prescribe her birth control. Private Practice S02E20 Do the right thing</i> Please just tell me it isn't happening again. If I lose another baby, I swear to God... Don't jump there, you always jump there. That is because I have lost every baby I've ever carried. - I'm sorry. - You're scared, but there's no reason to be. Right? Her cervix is open. The amniotic sac is protruding. - Can you stop it? - With cervical cerclage, yeah. Can you just stop talking doctor to each other and just talk to me? I'm gonna sew your cervix shut to keep the baby in. I want her to be transported by ambulance. I'll ride along to monitor. I'll call ahead. I'll meet you there. It'll be fine. I should be scared now, right? Is Sam running late? One of the great things about practicing law, Nai, is that court starts late. And... you get to dress up. You look good. Damned by faint praise. Handsome. Handsome. Winning. - A little better. - All right, let's do this. Now that's what I like to see in my expert witness, man, a little fire in the belly. But probably not bits of red delicious in the teeth. Let me see. You're good... - You ready to save a man's life? - Yes, sir. Good luck. All right, Big Ben. How you feelin' this week? Subpar. The second I walk outside, I start wheezing like a goat. You taking that milk thistle before every meal? Choking that down helps for a little, but I feel like my allergies are getting worse. Pretty Soon, you're gonna have to put me in a bubble. We'll make sure it's a cool bubble. Hop up there. I hate this part. How are the ladies treating you? Same as last week and the week before that. Hard to find a keeper. It doesn't get any easier at my age. My mom hasn't dated anyone since she and my dad got divorced. Sometimes people need a little time - to... - She's ready. She just doesn't meet guys who are, you know, smart and funny... Cool, like you. Hi, sorry. I just wanted to see how things were going in here. Come in, mom. Meet Dr. Pete. - How are you? - Nice to meet you. I'm sorry. His dad usually takes him, so I wasn't sure if I should stay in or out. You can stay in, right, Dr. Pete? As long as you don't mind me sticking needles in his face. I don't know. How long are we gonna have to keep them in? See? She's funny, right? And pretty. She does pilates, like, every day, makes awesome meat loaf... - Goof nut. Thank you. - No, it's okay. I like meat loaf. I don't like how Sheldon was looking at me. He had on that critical face. Like, " oh... - you're gonna eat all that? " - Don't mind him. I do mind him. I mind everyone, everyone who thinks that I choose to eat like a walrus, - much less look like one. - What're you gonna do? Babies need to be fed. It's only temporary. Breast-feeding alone - will burn a million calories. - Though you're not breast-feeding yet. Thought you were over Pete. I am. I am, entirely. You know what time it is? 10:42. Around here, we normally consider 9:00 to be the beginning of the workday. - Did I miss anything? - That's not the point. Listen, I know that you're having a hard time with Betsey gone, so I'm not gonna make an issue of this. But the next time you're late, - can you just please call? - Sure. Can you give me some help? Addison's gone, and I have a 12 year old who wants birth control. We need this baby. Not that I think a baby can or should save a marriage. I'm not stupid. But right now, this baby is holding us together. Before I got pregnant, Noah and I were gonna try things apart. I'm sorry. The second baby, I... I lost it at seven months. We've been through hell together. Hell is holding a dead baby in your arms. Our marriage... There were cracks, you know? And then they got bigger. They got huge. Whatever happened between us, this baby... You have to save it, 'cause this baby's our second chance. Naomi's great. Don't worry. The whole, you know, "kids grow up so fast " thing, I obviously... I get that. And... I assume you're being clear with Sarah that it's too early for sex. Dr. Freedman, she's already having it. She has a boyfriend, another eighth grader. They both have hormones raging, and frankly, I don't trust him to use a condom. - I'm trying to be proactive. - But you're condoning this. This is gonna happen whether I like it or not. I'm just trying to keep as much of it as I can on my terms. The kids are only allowed to have sex in my house when I'm there. Wait... I'm... I'm sorry. What? Would it be better if I force them to sneak around, scrambling for privacy God knows where with no supervision? Wouldn't it be better if you just told them no? And enforce it how? It's just me, and I work 50 hours a week. I can only try to steer her in the right direction, help her avoid getting hurt. She's 12 years old and she's having sexual intercourse. - She's already being hurt. - All due respect, you are out of line. - What's wrong? - We're leaving. Thank you. What'd you say to her? So you believe Dr. Allen's diagnosis and treatment were appropriate - under the circumstances? - More than appropriate. Extraordinary. Martin Weiser came into the E.R. with crushing chest pains, hypoxic, barely responsive. When the patient progressed to full cardiopulmonary arrest, Dr. Allen did C.P.R. And defibrillation, exactly as indicated... exactly as any doctor would do. So in your expert opinion, Dr. Bennett, were there mistakes made here? Even when we do everything right, and I believe Dr. Allen did, there're some patients we just can't save. Now that's not malpractice. That's... That's just life. Thank you, Doctor. I'm sorry.... Dr. Bennett, I am Corinne Lee. I'm counsel for mr. Weiser's widow and his son. "Every person is unique. A good doctor needs to know them, to evaluate them individually, not by the book. The book can be wrong." Excuse me, but is there a question somewhere here? Are you familiar with that quote, Dr. Bennett? That is a quote from my book. But doesn't it contradict what you were just saying about mr. Weiser's care? You quoted textbook cases and standard protocols. But you weren't there. You didn't actually see him. Isn't that correct? I stand behind everything I said about Dr. Allen's care. So you didn't mean what you wrote? I did.... I spent a lot of time researching and writing... Does that leave you much time for seeing actual patients? I have a very active medical practice. Oceanside Wellness Group. There was a measles outbreak there. - Did you follow the book on that one? - Objection. Argumentative. Dr. Bennett is holding himself up as an expert. I'm entitled to question him on that claim. Overruled. The measles outbreak. A child died. - Again, argumentative. - Withdrawn Was the noted cyclist Ray Daniels - a patient under your care? - Yes, he was. He had a serious heart muscle disorder, but you let him compete in a 100-mile bike race, and he died as well, didn't he? I told him not to race. But you treated him for a sports injury so that he could race. - See, Ray... was pigheaded. - Pigheaded? Do you always talk about your patients like that? - Or only the dead ones? - Wait... This family... lost a husband, a father. He walked in the door and did not get the treatment that he needed. Now it may be okay with you that patients just die. It's not okay with them. Let's talk about your nickname... "Dr. Feelgood." I just spent time with a happy, healthy girl that she has raised. Yvonne is obviously doing something right. She's doing a lot of things right. I don't think that excuses letting her daughter have sex in the room next to hers. Could you back me up here? It's not that simple. Adolescent sexuality is not something you can just say no to. You have to address the nuances of a particular situation. So a mother who acknowledges her daughter's desires - and tries to channel them safely is... - Probably doing the right thing. What are you doing? Hello, hopscotchers. The mother is allowing her 12-year-old daughter to have sex in her house. If you're not there, it's... really hard to know what's right for her and her daughter. Right, 'cause why would a man get a say? The mother knows best. That's how the world works. See? Okay, like with Dell, right? Mother does not always know best. - But it's apples and oranges. - It is not. And how can you, as the mother of a little girl, how... can you not have a problem with what yvonne is doing here? With Maya, this... zero chance of happening 'cause I would kill her. But I am talking about Yvonne's right as a parent to decide what is best for her child. Fine, but motherhood is not a trump card. - Wrong is wrong. - Parents get to decide that, Cooper. - Not doctors. - I just hope that when Betsey's 12, there's someone like Cooper there to say that it's not okay to be sleeping around, no matter what the mother thinks. I got Brody from anesthesia to come in for Morgan. I booked the O.R. for 4:00. What about the 26 weeks? Is that okay? It's late. I'm not gonna lie to you. But... it's the best choice. She loves you, you know? - I know. - She needs you. I know. Right pell, I'll see you tomorrow. He'll be fine. Thanks for coming in. - It was really nice to meet you. - Thank you so much - See you tomorrow - Really. Okay. Bye. How can you even think about sleeping with a patient's mother? - What? - That flirty smile, - leading to unnecessary but... - Come on. - Gentle physical contact. - You know what, Violet? You have no right to comment - on my love life. You don't. - It's an ethical issue. - I'm treating her son, not her. - You are taking advantage of a young, vulnerable mother who can't help but respond to someone in a position of authority. You think that's the only reason she might be interested in me? - Ethically speaking... - Wrong - person to talk to right now. - Problem? Never mind. What's your question? Dating a patient's mother... that's not a problem, right? Violet thinks it's a problem. I don't know, Pete. I'm about to operate on Noah's wife. And I like her. I really like her. And their marriage is on the rocks, and the only thing holding it together is this baby, and I'm supposed to save it. You'll save the baby. That's what you do. Of course I'm gonna save the baby. That's not the issue. It's... I don't know. Addison, their marriage... - It's... not in your hands. - What if it is? Then it's already gone south. I'm not a cheater, Pete. I'm not. Maybe that one time I did, but not now. I'm... it's not who I am. I am not a cheater. I know. Then why do I feel like I am? What happened? He just lost it on the stand, Nai. The other side came after him... The practice, his credibility... And he just... He just let her shred him up there. It was that bad? I know that I was the one that talked him into doing this, but I just... thought... He's Sam. All that experience in front of the camera... He's a doctor. He's not a spokes person. If there's any chance of turning this around, I need to put Sam back up there on that stand. But only if he can do it. - What happened? - Shortness of breath with pleuritic chest pain. Sats are dropping D-dimer's positive probably threw a P.E. Is the... The baby okay? There's no signs of fetal distress, Morgan. - V-fib. She's coding. - Get the crash cart, stat! Let's go. - Give me the bag. Give me the bag. - Get the cart over here. - Get ready to charge. - I'll do it. I'm gonna do it. No, look. She's my wife. I'll do it. Charge to 200. - Charged. - Okay. Clear. Charge to 300. All right. Clear. I got a pulse. Okay, pressure's coming up. Baby's heartbeat is normal. Start her on lidocaine. Call I.C.U. and tell 'em we need a room, now Bolus 75 milligrams, then start a 2-milligrams- per-minute drip. - She almost died. - But she didn't. She didn't. There's no way you could've known about the P.E. - I'm a heart surgeon. I should've. - There's no way... I live with her. I wasn't paying any attention. This isn't your fault. It is. It is my fault. I don't see her anymore. I don't - look at her... I don't think about her - But... not like I should. I mean, I care about the baby, but I don't... - I don't think about her. - But you just saved her life, Would you stop trying to make me feel better?! I don't think about her. All I think about is you. All I think about is you, and she could've died. She could've died. Feeling better? I looked like an idiot in there, Nai. I'm a good doctor. I'm a great doctor. Yes, you are a great doctor. - You are not a professional witness. - That's no excuse. Sam, I have seen you convince an entire auditorium of people to do what you wrote in your book. Now I know that you can convince 12 people that you're not a blithering idiot. He wants to put you back on the stand. - Really? - Yeah. That means I gotta go back over all the medicine from that case and memorize it. That way, no matter what I'm asked I'll be able to bring it back to what happened, what matters. I will not be thrown. Sarak luv this pics of you Bo thinks u r so hot naked.</i> I can't help it. All I want to do is eat and sleep and bark. I barked at Pete this morning. But, you know, he deserved it. He wants to date a patient's mother. What? A message from some kid about the naked pictures of my 12-year-old patient that are now apparently floating around. You still think mother knows best? - Who are you calling? - I'm calling D.C.F.S. About sarah? No, Cooper. You cannot do that. - Somebody needs to protect this girl. - You cannot call family services. I just got her blood work back. Sarah's pregnant. Maybe you should've dropped me as a patient. I seem to be trouble. You're doing fine now. Noah told me. He was, here... Till I woke up. Did you talk to him? What? He wouldn't look at me. I mean, he was here with me, but he wasn't with me. He wouldn't look at me. Did you talk to him? I think he just got a little... A little scared. We should be scared together. He should be able to look at me. Why don't you try to get some rest? We'll do the procedure tomorrow. Can I help you? I'm waiting for dr. Parker. Of course you are. - Do you think he'll be long? - I don't think so. No, dr. Parker, he's just finishing up some very important medical - stuff. - Stuff. Cool. Dell Parker, american hero. She's waiting for dr. Parker. We need to talk about Dell. He's late, he's playing doctor. I gotta go. So, I was going back over the records, trying to anticipate every question that they might ask me, and, well, two years ago, your patient had a hernia patched up. It was just a quick, 20-minute procedure. They gave him morphine for... - for the pain. - He wasn't my patient two years ago. I know, but morphine was overkill. They would've just given him a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory unless He was allergic to aspirin. Now the aspirin sensitivity would've... Would've been flagged, on the chart. But it's not. Right. I know it's not, because... See? The page is blank. Now every other page is filled out meticulously. This page is blank. You... You changed out the page. See, that would explain why you couldn't revive him. You gave him aspirin, and he was... It wasn't just a heart attack. I had a barely responsive patient with severe chest pains. I was racing against the clock. By the time that file came down, I was losing him. I couldn't afford to wade through his whole medical history. - No doctor would've had time. - Probably not, but you could've testified to that. - I would've backed you up. - And I would've lost everything. Juries don't care that we see aspirin sensitivity in what, one out of every thousand patients? They'd just hear the word " mistake, " And nothing else would get by. Does duncan known about this? He wouldn't have been able to put me on the stand to say something he knows isn't true. Dr. Bennett... Please. - You want me to lie for you? - I want you to speak fully and honestly about how I handled that code. Now I had to make a series of judgment calls, and I did what any good doctor would've, what you would've. You want me to lie. They're not gonna ask about that file. I'm good at what I do. I save lives. Please. I'm coming! - I was supposed to... - Cooper's not back yet. You gonna tell me the problem? You were right. I'm jealous. 'm not jealous like I want to be with him. I'm just jealous like... I don't want to see him with anybody else which is crazy and unfair. Crazy, but it makes sense... Given what you two had... May have. I know, but it's Pete. It's... It's sleep-with-the-temp Pete, sleep-with-anything Pete, I'm-bad-in-a-relationship Pete. - Good people do bad things. - Bad... people do bad things. I would kill for some whipped cream. People change. When they're with the right person, they can change. I slept with Archer Montgomery... When things were rocky with Cooper and me. Coop knows. He forgave me. Of course he's gonna forgive you. He has a neurotic desire to rescue, which makes him susceptible to hostile dependency. I confided in you to make a point about Pete. And maybe you want a little catharsis. You want a professional to tell you that it's okay. - It's not okay. - You think if I needed absolution, which I don't, I'd seek out someone who slept with two men one floor apart, and didn't have the courage or the decency to figure out let alone tell them whose baby she's carrying? Everybody's having sex. Everybody. Governors, they get call girls, girls sell their virginity on the internet, not a celebrity in this town goes out with their underpants on, but it's my 12-year-old patient who pays the price. How's that fair? I'm going to bed. I'm keeping this. You savoring the end of a good day or drowning out a bad one? The doctor that I'm the expert witness for did something wrong. So you have to testify to that. The thing that he did, the other side doesn't know about. That's the irony. They know that there's something wrong, but they're wrong about what it is. And if they don't ask me anything, and I don't say anything... They'll never know. I know how you feel. Want to talk about it? I... You can't tell Nai. - Okay. - And you can't say anything back... Or make any faces. - Okay. - Okay? Okay. The husband of one of my patients, there's something... Happening between me and him. And I don't know if I'm strong enough to stop it or... If I want to stop it. I don't know. What? I am not saying anything or making a face. Thank you. Having a conscience is brutal. My boobs hurt. Did you get sore? I mean, like, really, really sore? And I'm exhausted, and then I lay down, and it's nothing. And food tastes different, too. Do you know what I had for breakfast this morning? I had tuna fish and whipped cream. No, it tasted amazing. I don't know. Maybe I'm just looking at things differently right now. There's just amazing... Joy to this thing that's just... Amazing. But then the baby's head starts grinding against my pelvis and... - Oh, what? - Once you pop this baby out, - it's all gonna be worth it. - Look at you, all smiley. What? If you had sex last night, I do not want to hear about it. No sex, no. Sexy dream. Duncan. The suit guy? - Oh, nice. - Yeah, well, nice in a dream, but, You know, he's one of Sam's oldest friends. He's working with Sam. It just... it might be a little too close to home. You and Sam work together. Your lives are intertwined. How are you ever gonna meet anyone who's not too close to home? How are any of us ever gonna meet anyone who's not too close to home? - I think we should amputate. - Okay. All right. You ready for another round? Sure, but can I use the bathroom first? What? You just went. The guy's got needles in here, and I have a nervous bladder. I don't know what's gotten into him. I do have needles in here. I know why Ben likes you. But the real test... The real test is, Do you have anything for stress and exhaustion? How about... A nice long dinner at Casa Del Mar? Is that a prescription or an invitation? Both. She's pregnant? Oh, my God. You're gonna be okay, Sarah. How soon... How soon can we, take care of it? I'm so sorry. I should've never let this happen, but I will fix it. Let's all just take a breath, okay? This is new and it's hard and it's very scary. But there are a lot of factors to consider before we... Get to that point, okay? You okay? I know this is scary, and you shouldn't have to go through this at your age. We've heard your point of view and of course she shouldn't have to go through it. She's having an abortion. - This is where you put your foot down? - She's 12 years old. And where did you think it was leading? - Excuse me. - Thank you. I want to keep the baby. Hey, Violet, I asked Lisa out. Ben's mom. It's not wrong, I'm doing it openly, and I don't want to fight about it so I'm telling you. I understand. I'm trying to do the right thing here, whatever that is, and... But I also need to have a life. You should. Thanks. - You need to back off in there. - How... How are we s... Forget it. Good morning. I went out pretty hard last night. I felt like crap this morning, so... What, so you just decided to sleep in? Actually, I was up early, but I had bed spins. Then I saw it was 3 to 5 and glassy. Figured I'd get an hour in the water before I headed here. - This is not you. - Maybe this is me, and maybe since I'm only 24, I should be able to go out and have a little fun. No one's saying you can't have any fun. But you've responsibilities here I'm sick of trying to work so hard to do the right thing all the time. Work full-time, get licensed, act like an adult... who cares? Who cares? Your sats look good. I'll have the nurse come and prep you for the cerclage, - and I will meet you in the O.R. - Have you see Noah? He's not here yet? He hasn't come or answered the phone. - I'll page him. Maybe he's in surgery. - I already tried. He's not. I can't do this without him. We can't wait on this. We have to do it now. Then find him for me. Please. Just find him. What was so important I had to run up here in the middle of my day? I want to throttle someone. - You gotta be kidding. - I'm so... I'm serious. I just had to I had to walk out of a consult so I didn't explode at the mother of my 12-year-old patient... My pregnant 12-year-old patient... whose mother has decided all of a sudden she's interested in parenting again. I should've called D.C.F.S. Coop, isn't this what you wanted, - for her to step up and parent? - Parent? She is dictating an abortion to a 12 year old. Is she wrong? Probably not. I see what it is doing to that girl and what it's going to be doing to her. And I find that hard... To forgive. You forgave me... For worse. - What happened? - I don't know. He called me from a friend's house, said he's having trouble swallowing and then in the car, he said he was feeling dizzy. Maybe I should've brought him to the hospital. That's okay. We'll take care of him right here. He never had a problem with food. It's only been environmental. Problems can start at any age, and Ben's a highly allergic kid. - Something's... Wrong. - You're having an acute allergic attack but you're gonna be okay. I'll take care of you, I just have to grab a couple of things. He's gonna get some medicine. You're gonna feel better in just a little bit, I'm right here. I'm right here. It's gonna be okay. You're gonna feel better in just a couple more seconds. I'm gonna give you some adrenaline. It's gonna open up your airway. Is your throat opening? You getting some air? - It's working. - Thank you. You're gonna be okay. Thank you. So based on your years of experience, the dozens of cardiac patients that you have personally attended to, in your professional opinion, dr. Bennett, Did dr. Allen do everything that he reasonably could do to save the patient? Yes, he did. Is there anything that you would've done differently? Given what dr. Allen knew at the time, no. No further questions. Recross. What do you mean, "given what dr. Allen knew at the time"? Objection. Calls for speculation. Overruled. You may answer the question. Dr. Allen was working so fast, and he was under so much pressure... That he didn't stop to look at the patient's full medical history. So he was not aware that Martin Weiser had an aspirin allergy. That's not in any of our discovery. That's because, dr. Allen swapped out one of the pages from the file. He lied? Yes. You should've come to me and told me what you found. That would've put you in an impossible position. - And you thought this would be better? - You wanted me here as an expert, a doctor. That means I'm asking people to trust me with their lives every day. Now part of that trust means telling the truth. Even when it's hard, I have to tell the truth. You should've come to me. You want to tell me what you're doing? I can't look at her. - She'll see it in my eyes. - It's time for her surgery, Noah. - Look, I'm cheating on her. - No In my soul, I am... I'm cheating on her. She deserves more. - What kind of man... - No, listen to me. Your wife is about to have a procedure that scares the hell out of her. She's upstairs, she's alone and she needs you. What kind of man are you? You're the kind of man who puts his own feelings aside, as hard as that might be, and goes in that O.R. and holds his wife's hand. That's the kind of man you are. I screwed up. I had my chance to be a parent, and I screwed up. Now she doesn't care what I have to say. You know what she told me? That she's the baby's mother, so she gets to decide. She's right. You can't force her to have an abortion. But you're still her mother. And if she's gonna be a parent, she's gonna need you even more. Sarah is still a child, and she as a lot to learn - from you. - You think she'll listen to me? I think you have to keep trying. - I didn't think you were coming. - I'm here. - Tell me it's gonna be okay. - It is. Everything's gonna be okay. How'd the testimony go? - It was complicated. - Complicated good, or complicated bad? You want to come down by the water with me, have a drink, I'll tell you? - I have plans, so... - Oh, okay. I'm going out with Duncan. Really? Oh. Okay. - So tomorrow? - Sure. Sure. - How you doing? - You look fantastic. I do? Thank you. What do you think you're doing? Spare me the sermon, okay? Naomi's already preached to me twice. This isn't a sermon, and I'm not preaching. I'm telling you to cut the crap. Now I know that Heather took Betsey, and you're hurting, but that does not give you carte blanche to blow this job off or treat this place with any disrespect. This is a top-notch private medical practice, and everybody around here is gonna act like it at all times, no matter what's going on in their private lives, including you. Pete is on a date with a patient's mother, which follows him sleeping with a coworker or three. Violet got knocked up, probably in this exact same office, the same office where you and Naomi You better stop it right there. This ends here. You're gonna take your ass home, get some sleep, come back first thing tomorrow morning with a better attitude. You've got a family who needs you here, Dell. Gimmie pizza! Gimmie pizza! - All right, all right. - Gimmie pizza! All right. Here. All right, margaritas, chimichangas... You ready, amiga? What? Violet's crazy and hostile and needy, and she drives me up a wall... But she needs you, Coop. Go home. I don't know... Why I'm here. I just...
