She's dealing with it.I'm suppot Until she decides that she's ready? We need to talk to our daughter now. Sam, this isn't the first time I've delivered this kind of news. People need time. Give... Give naomi some time. Colin, you have a severe infection. How long has it been hurting? A month. I thought it was normal pain. And I was afraid that if it was the bolt, Then I couldn't keep the arm. Well, dr. Wilder feels the bolt should come out. No. Can't we do more antibiotics or something? Well, what do you say, dr. Wilder? You specialize in infectious disease. You know alternative treatments. What are his options? There has to be something up your sleeve Since you have two of them. There are experimental protocols, But the f.D.A. Hasn't completed safety studies, And there are reports of severe side effects. I'm sorry. The bolt is the source of the infection, And the safest thing to do is remove it Before the infection spreads. Before I deployed, I got engaged. We wrote letters, we planned the whole thing, Right down to the dance, Which requires me to dip her to the floor. Now I'm living up to my part of this. I'm going to hold her in my arms-both arms- And I'm going to dance with her the way I promised. You came back alive. You're healthy and alive. I know you planned for more, but I cannot treat you In a way that will jeopardize your health. Dr. Wilder- Colin, this infection could kill you. I know that's not what your fiancÃƒÂ©e wants. (violet) why do they do this? Why does the hospital keep sending me samples? It's like "gaslight," but with baby stuff. "gaslight"? Famous movie? Never saw it. Ingrid bergman. Her husband tries to drive her crazy. Uh, when the petermans get here, Will you put them in exam room three? I'm using exam room three. Oh, actually room three is for pediatrics. And I have a 7 year old with a urinary tract infection. It's-it's about a marriage that ends badly. "gaslight." Marsha. Hi. Violet turner. Uh, here's the situation- I don't want any more baby stuff. So no diaper cream samples. I've-I've called, I've e-mailed, I've mail-mailed for the past six months, But the hospital just keeps sending it. Most new mothers appreciate our little freebies. Well, I am not a new mother. How old is your baby? That's not what I meant. I am not a new or an old or any kind of mother. I don't have a baby anymore. Oh. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry for your loss. They're god's littlest angels, The ones we lose. Could you just get the form? Of course. I'm sorry, too, for your loss. Oh, no, no. It's just- I- I was just- No, no, no. You don't have to explain. I-I get it. I- I- I lost my wife today. Oh, my god. A sentence you never think you're gonna have to say, You know, "I lost- I lost my wife." And, uh, every time you say it, You think you're not gonna be able to breathe, And it's like-it's like somebody shot you or something. And then I-and then I hear That you lost your child- your baby-and it's- It, like, gives it perspective, you know? It-it's-it's-it helps me to know you lost your child. And I know that's a horrible thing to say to you. Um... My wife's dead, and I've offended you, And I'm sorry... For your loss. No, no. I'm-I'm sorry for your loss. They gave me this bag with her... Belongings. It's... (exhales) it's funny. I thought there'd be more to take home. Do you need... Can I help you? Is there anything I can do? Uh, no. No, no. I- I'm just waiting. A friend's picking me up, so... Okay. Well... It was nice to meet you. I'm nathan pilsman. Violet turner. It's nice to meet you, violet turner. Well, not nice, but... It's nice. (whirring) (footsteps approach) You can't walk. You're black. What game are we playing? The day that you found out... When they told you that, uh, your legs- That you would-you would never walk again, That must have been the worst day of your life. How did you deal with it? Why would you assume thateen that was my worst day?Our life. Losing my legs changed my life, But, uh, it certainlythateen didn't ruin it. There's a period of adjustment, But... You deal with it. You're full of crap. (elevator bell dings) (indistinct conversations) Naomi, what-what are you doing here? Mom, what are you doing? What's going on? Naomi, what is going on? I need you to give maya an abortion. What? Nai. Mom, no. I don't want an abortion. I don't care what you want. But, mom- Give her an abortion. I can't believe I slapped her. I hit my child. You were upset, clearly. It's not an easy thing to deal with. I know, I know, but I... Well, I can't-I lost it. But c-can you believe her? Can you believe her saying no to me? What? You ordered her to have an abortion. So putting aside the fact that you are personally against it- You can't make someone have an abortion, nai. No, no, no. This is-this-this is not up for discussion. I think it needs to be. Well, you know what? If you're not gonna do it, that's fine. I will find another doctor who will. Okay, I don't even know who I'm talking to right now. This is not you. It's the opposite of you. You-you give people babies, And whether or not I agree with your stand on this issue, This isn't you. Don't do something now that you will he yourself for later. Do you hate yourself for your abortions? Either of you? No, I don't hate myself. But I do think about it. It stays with you even if you do it for the right reasons, And it is not a casual decision that you can make for maya. This-this is my family. You do not judge my family! We're not judging. You know that. Look, this has hit you hard, And that can make you change what you believe- stop it. Stop it. (voice breaking) stop acting like you understand, Because you don't. You don't. This is my child. This is my child we are talking about, my child...</i> Who I've done everything in my power to raise and protect. And now she's gone and done something stupid- Stupid- that'sonna ruin her life, And I'm not gonna let that happen. I am her mother. I am her mother. Naomi- You have no right. You have no moral high ground. You walked away from your child. If you can live with that, I can live with this. She's just upset. You- I know. (knocks on doorjamb) (clears throat) uh, I know this is a bad time, But my patient-I-I could really use your help. Yes. Please. Tell me she needs surgery. That I can do. Oh, don't need your help opening a door. You're n very good at taking help, are you? Oh, actually, I am. Your idea about experimental protocols? I contacted my friend At the f.D.A., got the info, went with it. You're not taking out colin's bolt? You might be afraid to take a risk, but I'm not. I assumed naomi brought you in Because you were just as cuttinedge As everyone else around here. I didn't realize you were the safe alternative. All right, you know what? You-hey. Hey. Hey. You can't just say sething like that and roll away. Can't hear you over the noise of my chair. (elevator bell dings) Hey, pete. Maya is pregnant. Sam needs to drink. You in? (lynn) oh! Uh, lynn's in a lot of pain. She shows no sign of fetal distress, But her labor isn't progressing. I thought after my water broke... Well, I can give you oxytocin to speed up the labor And something for the pain. My birth plan says no drugs. Lynn has a birth plan. Oh, many pages... And small font. Yeah. I want to experience my child's birth. Uh, lynn- I did my homework, okay? I understand that there are procedures That, you know, may become necessary, But except in a case of extreme emergency, You know, I want to be given the opportunity to accept or- Or refuse any procedure. And as long as the baby's okay, all right, I want to have a natural childbirth. So to get the labor going, I'm willing to try walking Or castor oil or nipple stimulation- Well, it's a little more involved. If you fail to progress in your labor, You might want to consider a c-section. No. No. Lynn, look, I know this can be disappointing- I've been in screaming pain for hours. I'm not-I'm not worried about being disappointed. (grunts) You know, I-I married a great guy. You know, I wanted to have kids. He wasn't ready... Ever. And... When the divorce was final, I decided to let loose. You know, having a baby alone, Being pregnant by some guy that I met at the tequila bar, Is not every girl's dream, But this is what's happening, okay? And I am having this baby. So is it too much to ask That one thing goes according to plan? (harper simon's "berkeley girl" playing) (sam) naomi has lost her mind. I don't even know who she was today. Do you want maya to have an abortion? Well, that's the point. I'm a guy. It's- it's-it's not my choice. Well, right, but do you want her to- Do I-I want her to not be pregnant in the first place. I want her to never have had sex. I want her to live in a world Where there are chastity belts and convents And little boys by the name of dink don't exist. That-that's what I want. So don't ask me if I want... My baby girl to have an abortion. Don't-don't ask me that. Ã¢Â™Âª blowin' down a country lane Ã¢Â™Âª Because the answer is probably yes. Ã¢Â™Âª she's got the s... Ã¢Â™Âª But it's not my choice. You know, it's not naomi's either. Look, just be glad you and charlotte don't have a kid. Oh. Once you have a child with someone, You are tied to them forever, Even if they go nuts. (scoffs) (laughs) I'm-I'm sorry. I didn't... (laughs) I didn't mean that, man. Ã¢Â™Âª and the hills of echo park Ã¢Â™Âª My daughter's pregnant. Ã¢Â™Âª she is crinoline and satin Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª she is leopard skin and lace Ã¢Â™Âª Oh, I'm still here. But then, so are you. Well, I left and I came back. I thought about you and I was worried. You don't have a friend coming, do you? No. I'm not ready. The thing is... I can't leave without my wife. Obviously, I-I can't leave with her. So I can't leave. Ã¢Â™Âª...Berkeley girl Ã¢Â™Âª Can I sit with you for a while? Sure. Ã¢Â™Âª...The moon and the sun Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª oh Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª ah Ã¢Â™Âª Did you feel this way When you lost your child? Well... Yeah, walking out that door Was the hardest thing I ever did. But... Yeah, yeah, I did feel this way. Ã¢Â™Âª ooh Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª oh, berkeley girl Ã¢Â™Âª I have this tingling In-in my stump, in my shoulder and my feet. It's like they're asleep. I can't wake them up. (motor whirs) What is it? What's happening?Rhythmically) Uh, a side effect of the antibiotics Is neurotoxicity- nerve damage. Is this what dr. Wilder was afraid of? No. I'm gonna lower the dosage on the antibiotic. That should lessen the effect. We'll give it a shot. (motor whirring) Oh. Oh, god! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! G-oh! (knock on door) This is how today should've gone dn. When we found out at our daughter was pregnant, We should've cried on each other's shoulders, We should've listened to what our daughter had to say, And then the two of us, Together, should have discussed how to handle this. That's not what happened. Talk to me. Deal with this. I don't want to talk about it. And I am dealing with it. Maybe not the way you want me to, but... It's the only way I can. I'll do it. I'll have the abortion. Her. Oh, yeah. That's grief. Definitely. Dead husband? Dead kid? It's dead kid. It's her face. She's got dead kid face... Like you. I'm sorry. That didn't come out right. No, it's okay. It's all right. What do you mean about my face? It's your eyes. You-you've been someplace That most people have never been. You've survived something That no one would have wanted to survive. It's your eyes. It's... They're, I don't know, empty. Well, I mean, that could be just... Doesn't have to be dead kid. It could just be... Bad life. No, it's dead kid or dead something. What about me? Your face? I mean, I know you don't know me, But do I look different? You look like you're in shock, nathan. You look like something bad happened. It's really nice of you to sit here, you know, But you don't- you don't have to stay. I'm sure that you have someplace to be. Uh... No, actually. I don't. Okay. Okay. Sorry. I thought you'd be at the gym. I just came to get the rest of my stuff. Yeah, well, okay. I bought the latex jumpsuit. For me. You bought it for me. What, are you gonna have some other woman wear it? Well, so should I give it to you So you could wear it for some other guy? Cooper, we can do this. We liked each other once. Actually, we didn't. We disliked each other, and then we had sex, And then we fell in love. We never liked each other. I guess you're right. I think you should leave the practice. What? I'll take out a loan. I'll sell my car. I'll do whatever it takes to buy you out. No. No? No. I'm building a business. I don't care if you were there first. I belong there just as much as you do. I'm not going anywhere. (hangers clatter) useless, stupid love. What? Useless, stupid love! Wasted time. Just take your latex jumpsuit. Find another woman. Have a blast with it! Oh, I c- I will! I can't wait. That's my towel you're wearing. I want it back. (door closes) (lynn) oh, god! Oh, god! You're doing great, lynn. Yeah. I feel great. Uh, we-we could change the music. We haven't listened to "chirping birds" yet. I just wanted this to be beautiful, you know? All my books said That the way a child comes into the world Shapes them for life. I just want to give him the best chance That he can have, you know? Mm-hmm. I- I don't want to shape him To be some angry or-or scared... (groans) Damn it. Oh. I want him to have a good life. Okay, look... No matter how today works out, Even if you decide you can't take the pain, You're still gonna have plenty of opportunities To shape your child's life. So can I give you something to help with the pain? No. Just give me the chirping birds. Okay. Yeah. (birds chirp) How many have you done? More than I can count. And they've all... They've turned out... Well, "fine" isn't the word I'd use, But without complications. My daughter's having an abortion tomorrow. That in and of itself is a complication. Sam, is it weird that it's me... Doing it? No. Would you prefer that I get a- I'd understand if- no, you do it. You do it the best you have ever done anything. Do it like your life depends on it. (voice breaks) it's maya. Oh. Oh. Ugh. Colin, what happened? Something's wrong. I- I told 'em to call you. I- I know you wanted to take the bolt out. You told me the antibiotics were too risky, but I w- this isn't even the right dosage. Dr. Fife lowered it. He- it was- He said it was damaging my nerves And he said that his arm wouldn't work and-ohh. (vomits) damn it. The infection is spreading. Get me a central line kit. (groans) You have got to get that bolt out. I'll take it under advisement. You-it- this is his life, And you are so concerned with your invention. It's what colin wanted. It's what you sold him. Naomi was right about you. You're full of crap. You don't want to fix his arm. You want to fix your legs. No. I already tried, and I can't. Okay, is that supposed to make me feel sorry for you? I'm not doing this for me. I've accepted what I lost And I'll accept it for colin as well, but not yet. You just don't want to see it. Maybe, and maybe there is something out there That we haven't thought of yet. Look, I'm not good at asking for help, but I'm asking. My patient wants to pick up his life were it left off. It may not be what you would choose, But it's what he chooses. So do it for him. (woman speaking indistinctly over p.A.)</i> (thud) (thud) You did not just see that. Isn't that what you were wearing yesterday? Uh, yeah. Just... Helping out a friend. Want me to loan you something? Did you move all your stuff in here? I sold my place. I know. It was a rookie miake. Giving it all up for a guy, moving into cooper's apartment, Moving into the practice where he worked. (chuckles) I changed my life to be with him. I went all-in on forever. Does cooper know that? No point now. He wants me out. He wants to pretend we didn't happen, that I don't exist. Well, he thinks that's gonna make him feel better. But it won't. It'll just make him feel... A- alone. I know the feeling. Me, too. So... Do you want to wear slutty or professional? (lynn) oh, dell! Dell! This is a big one! Still? I... Aah! Ã¢Â™Âª (man) Ã¢Â™Âª it sure is hard to be apart Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª but our tv show... Ã¢Â™Âª So we're here. Okay. Is everybody, uh, sure about this? Just... Do it. Ã¢Â™Âª Maya. Ã¢Â™Âª does she still know Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª they're the ones? Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª her favorite daughter's favorite sons Ã¢Â™Âª (knock on door) I couldn't stay stairs. Charlotte? She won't leave. And then sam and naomi... I feel like I should-I should do something for them, Like I should send food or something, but... Well, nobody's sick. Sending a tub of soup isn't gonna help. I know. What am I supposed to do, pete? About charlotte? Accept it, move on. I mean, there's nothing you can do. Sam and naomi? I don't know, man. I... Maybe that's why people send soup. Nothing you can do. Ã¢Â™Âª you say you're worried Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª I say I am, too Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª it's okay, it's what you're supposed to do Ã¢Â™Âª Do you remember the day maya lost her first tooth? It fell out in the yard. We spent about four hours looking for that thing Because without proof, The tooth fairy wouldn't pay up. Ã¢Â™Âª And then there's today. Ã¢Â™Âª (sighs) you know, we're gonna get through this. Once this whole thin is over and done, We're gonna get back there. (exhales) Say something! Anything! What do you want me to say? You wa me to say that I did the wrong thing? Okay. I did the wrong thing. Do I believe that I'm going to hell For forcing our daughter to have an abortion? (voice breaking) absolutely. Do I regret doing what I had to do? No. Ã¢Â™Âª I would do anything, I would give my life to protect her, And if it means that I'm going to hell, then fine. I'm going to hell. Oh, naomi- I failed, sam. (sobs) I failed... First in our marriage, and now at being a mother. No. This is on both of us. I thought I taught her right from wrong. But she didn't listen. It's like nothing I did made any difference. I failed. Ã¢Â™Âª You're gonna experience some discomfort And some bleeding afterward for about a week. The entire procedure won't take long. I'm gonna use this instrument attached to suction To remove the pregnancy. You'll have some cramping, Just for a few seconds. Do you understand? Maya, it's really- It's important that you tell me whether or not you understand. No. I don't understand. Okay. Ask me. (clears throat) Anything you want to know. All my life, my mom told me that she would never... Never do this, That from the second they're conceived, A baby is a life- a gift from god- And that abortion is wrong... That it's murder. Yes. That's what your mother believes. What about you? What do you believe? I believe that until a fetus can survive on its own Outside the mother's body, That it is not a life. I believe that life begins at birth. So you think my mom was wrong before And that she's right now because she wants me to do this? I think that your mother and I think differently. That doesn't help me. Maya, I can't help you with this decision. I can and will give you an abortion Or I can offer other options And see you through this pregnancy. But I can't help you decide. I'm 15 years old. Which is why you shouldn't have been having sex In the first place. And I say that as your aunt addie, okay? But... As your dtor, maya, Since you already have had sex And because you are pregnant... Maya... I know this is hard. I know that this is... An unimaginably difficult, grown-up decision, And it's not fair that you have to make it. But you did a grown-up thing. And now you are in a grown-up predicament. So now it doesn't matter what I believe Or what your mother believes. What matters is what you believe. It's up to you. But my mom said I- Until the 24th week of pregnancy, What a woman does with her own body is her business. It's law. It's the law, maya. And of lot of fine women fought a long time To give you the right to do what you think is best.</i> Your body, your choice. Maya, you know what you want to do. In your heart, in your gut, You know which way you want to go. I've done this enough to know that. You know what you want to do. Okay? You just need to tell me. (lady of the sunshine's "silr revolver" playing) Ã¢Â™Âª hey, mama Ã¢Â™Âª I know you're tired, but on this next contraction, I'm really gonna need you to push. I can't. Yes, you can. It hurts. Come on, lynn. This is what you wanted, okay? You can do it. (crying) I was wng, okay? My birth plan is stupid. It's not working. I've been awake for three days. I feel like I've been run over by a train. Okay, just turn off the hippie-ass flute sic And give me some drugs, now! O- okay, okay. I- I can't give you drugs. But I want drugs! Okay? You said I could change my mind! Okay. I know it hurts, but we're almost there. And that's why I can't give you any drugs. Please stop saying that. (sobs) Okay, listen... You had a plan, and you've stuck to it, And not everyone can do that, but you did. And I am here with you, and we are going to get through this. I promise. (whimpers) oh. Now push. (screaming) Obviously the results weren't what we hoped. I know it was just metal. But... I swear, When I caught that tennis ball, I could feel it. It was fuzzy, just a little bit of give. We have to remove the bolt and a margin of tissue To make sure the infection is gone. And we may need to remove the rest of your arm, Possibly all the way up to your shoulder. That's one option. It would definitely save your life. But... But what? There's been some success With biodegradable antibiotic implants. It's risky. It requires surgery. We'd have to implant the antibiotics Directly next to the bolt site. Give you the life you want, let you dance at your wedding. Ã¢Â™Âª oh, lover Ã¢Â™Âª (exhales deeply) Ã¢Â™Âª pass the silver Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª silver revolver Ã¢Â™Âª (woman) okay, you guys ready? (laughs) (children laugh) okay, slow down. We never had kids. My wife wanted kids. Ã¢Â™Âª I think we should leave. Look, you-you have lost someone here Who's very important to you. And you're afraid That if you go home and walk into an empty room, That'll mean you're really alone. I will be alone. No. I'll... I'll go with you. Ã¢Â™Âª it's all in my head, it's all in my head Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª it's all in my head Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª it's all in my head Ã¢Â™Âª I didn't do it. What? I'm not having an abortion. Ã¢Â™Âª it's in my... Ã¢Â™Âª Mom! Stop. What are you doing? Naomi. Ow! Ow! Hey! If you're coming in, you better be taking pictures. Is that what you want? Addison, a little help. I am not gonna let you ruinour life, little girl. All right, lynn. Now come on. Push. You think you know what you want? You have no idea. You have no idea what you want. Look at that. Look at that. Okay. (cries) hi. Hi. (baby coos) Ã¢Â™Âª But look at that. (fusses) Ã¢Â™Âª all I've ever been to myself Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª is my own enemy Ã¢Â™Âª (maya) mom. Mom. Mommy! (crying) I can't. I'm sorry. I- I can't. (addison) nai. It's okay. Shh. (sobbing) (sighs) shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Naomi. Nai. This isn't the end of the world. You will get past this. I need to get outta here. Don't do this. You don't want to turn your back on your child. You just shut up! Just for once, just shut up! For a minute, for now, shut up! Well... This is fun. It's fine. (chuckles) bet you'd be a great date. If my wife hadn't just died, I'd ask you out. (chuckles)that was funny. Let's try walking through the door. We thought she had a cold. A few years ago, we were supposed to go on a skiing trip, And we thought she had a cold. But it never went away. Cancer. And I-I knew it was coming. I knew it. So I slept there. I slept in that hospital with her for months. This house... It was the last time we were happy together. (diane birch's "magic view" playing) Ã¢Â™Âª turning Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª turning are the tables... Ã¢Â™Âª One step at a time. Ã¢Â™Âª here before me Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª oh, but you're so lovely Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª lovely as you are Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª I know you'll leave me Ã¢Â™Âª (inhales deeply) Ã¢Â™Âª high up in a tree I can't climb down Ã¢Â™Âª I thought... I thought it would kill me. Stepping back into this house, I thought it would- I thought it would make her more gone. But... She's here. She loved it here. And we were happy in this house. Thank you. Ã¢Â™Âª burning Ã¢Â™Âª (sniffles) Violet? That dead kid face? Ã¢Â™Âª I'm turning Ã¢Â™Âª Ã¢Â™Âª turning into me Ã¢Â™Âª It's not my son. Ã¢Â™Âª...Heaven Ã¢Â™Âª My son isn't dead. It's me.
