- Please. Violet doesn't care right now to give the partnership to Godzilla, Addison would say it to my face since I've payed for what you owe you'd be a fool to block me. - That leaves Sam. - Everybody's really busy. - We haven't had time to discuss it. - You're my man on the inside. Work your magic. Want to play python in the forest? I'm gonna stand up very slowly now. Would you let go? - You really want me to? - No. Come on. I'm really late. I want this, Cooper. I want to join the practice. I have to go. You feel sick now, but you get on the stand and just look straight at the prosecutor... Only at him. That's what I did, okay? You don't have to do this if you don't want to. No, I do, I do. I want to. Violet Turner. Sorry I'm late. Please raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Dr. Turner... It's customary to say "I do." I can't do this. I can't do it. Saison 03 Episode 05 Strange Bedfellows</i> - Any word on the trial? - No, not yet. But Violet's on the stand all day. Oh, I heard back from Stan Parsons. - Ooh, and? - He is happy where he is. Stan really would've fit in well here. We could use another ortho guy. Yeah, well, we could use any doctor at this point. Look, what if... just keep an open mind here... What if we just... went with Charlotte? You cannot seriously think that she would fit in here. She's skilled, she's connected, she's a specialty we don't have. What happened? Why are you back? She refused to testify. - Did you try to talk to her about it? - I tried. Well, she needs support, Cooper. It's hard. I know it's hard and I am supporting her but she won't talk to me about it. She won't talk to me, either, and she won't talk to Pete, so looks like it's your turn. If she won't talk to them, she's not gonna talk to me. What the hell are you doing here? No, they told us that you'd left the practice. They promised us that you'd left the practice. - You people lied to us! - Zoe, you have this all wrong. I do not work here anymore. You screw up our implantations, and then you force us to carry each other's babies I'm sorry. Just sit. I have high blood pressure. - That's why you're here? - The appointment's for me. Our obstetrician thinks there might be something wrong with the baby. - Which one? - Mine. Sorry. The... the baby that I'm carrying, her son. It gets a little confusing sometimes. Dr. Carey said that we needed a consult... surgical... and the only one he'd recommend was you. While you're here, we'll go ahead and get your blood pressure checked. Zoe, why don't you come on back? I'm sorry that I blew up. I-I thought I was okay with everything, but it... it's been hard. My pregnancy, Amelia's pregnancy, and then seeing Naomi again, I just... - Something is wrong, isn't it? - Give me a second. - Dr. Carey deflected all my questions. - I won't do that. Oh, my god. What is it? It's a teratoma. It's a kind of tumor. Sometimes when the stem cells differentiate into cartilage, bone or flesh, they end up where they don't belong. And in this case, the tumor is large enough, that it's taking over the baby's blood supply. What I'd like to do is operate, try to separate the tumor from the fetus. - And will that fix it? - It's not that simple. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't work. But without surgery, the baby will die. This is Amelia's last embryo, so... I have to tell you that if I do the surgery, I'll need to perforate the uterus. Sometimes... that can affect your ability to carry another child. I know it's an awful choice. You'll want to talk it over with your husband, - with Amelia. - Uh, no. Martin left. He never liked it... the having each other's baby thing. And he... he didn't understand the bond between Amelia and I. It's... it's like... Both babies belong to both of us. I can't do it. Martin will come back, and we've always wanted a big family. I just can't. Then I'd recommend terminating the pregnancy. My god. What will that do to Amelia? And if we do nothing, it's gonna die in the womb? Then I think I should let it and get Amelia further along. I can't have her think that I just gave up. I think that it's better for her to think that it's an act of god, - whenever it happens. - This is Amelia's baby. - She has the right to know. - It's in my body, and I'm your patient. You can't tell her without my permission. You can't tell her. You look like somebody shredded you. - Did you talk to Violet again? - No, no. I just... Remind me never, ever to go upstairs again. No, I didn't talk to Violet. I didn't know what to say to her. - You gonna have another run at her? - Nope. I'm done. I tried. I pushed. I... had no effect on her. So if she wants to let Katie walk... Katie is not gonna walk away from this. No, but the defense will line up experts - who will say she was crazy. - Wasn't she? Not guilty by reason of insanity is not guilty, and Katie is guilty. Six months in a nut farm, some meds, a little therapy, after what she did? That's unacceptable. You don't know how long it's gonna be. - She could be in there for years. - I got on the stand and told them about the wound, the blood, the baby gone, thinking Violet was dead. But unless Violet tells the jury what it was like, unless they hear it from her... But if Violet is gonna be too traumatized... Then she'll just keep being stuck. She'll never be Violet. And I'll still have a son whose mother can't bring herself to care about him. She's missing everything... The little sound he makes when he smiles... The way his eyes try to take in the whole world at once. - It's just gonna take time. - She can have as much as she wants. I'm done. - Cooper put you up to this? - We're all concerned for you. Why does it matter if I testify or not? Why should I have to sit there and relive it? Why am I the only person who can make sure Katie gets punished? - It's not about Katie It's about you. - That's right. It's about me. So sitting there for 8, 10 hours a day on the stand with Katie staring at me? That would be like living through it all over again. Aren't you doing that anyway? And don't shrinks always say it's good to talk? - Well, what do shrinks know? - I know facing her will be hard. Being on the same planet with her is hard. We could all chip in and get her one of those guest trips to the space station, one-way. We could probably get a discount if it's one-way, right? Dr. Turner, there's someone here to see you. - Who is it? - A Mr. Kent. He says to tell he's Katie's father. Could you give us a second, please? All right, Violet. If you had a patient in this situation, would you tell your patient to face it or to run away? All right, you see that chair? I'm gonna be sitting in it. If you need help, you look at me, you blink, and I'll come riding to the rescue. You can still blink, can't you? Can you... When Dr. Wilder testified... What he found... to hear... It's horrifying. I can't apologize to you enough. You helped her. Well... if that were true, we wouldn't be sitting here. No, she couldn't stop talking about you, how you just knew. You knew that all she wanted was to have her baby and... be not sick anymore. She told me I was going to be so proud of her. She said, "you'll see, dad. I'm gonna be just like mom." If that jury sends her to prison, she'll disappear. This illness will eat her alive. Why are you here? Katie wants to see you. She wants to talk to you. She says you're the only person who understands. - Violet talked to you? - Yeah, I guess she was just ready. But to you? Do you want to hear what she had to say or not? She doesn't want to testify because she's terrified of facing Katie. - That's the revelation? - We were interrupted. Katie's father showed up. Why? What did he want? I don't know. But when he left, she went and hid in the ladies room. - You got a minute? - Yeah. Just... in one minute. I was talking to Sam. - We're just in the middle of a... - It'll only take a second. I am a damn fine doctor with an established patient base, and as I made clear, I have great ideas for expanding it. I have the cash to buy in. I'm chief of staff at St. Ambrose, so I can steer you so many heart surgeries, you'll beg for mercy. Why are you stalling? Because I just don't think you're... the right fit here. You know, we're... all friends, we respect each other, we get along. I guess that would be why Naomi and Pete couldn't get outta here fast enough. We need someone who is great with patients, someone who's great with staff - someone's who calm... - You want Naomi. I don't want to be mean, but I just don't like you. Good grief. What does that have to do with anything? Excuse me. I need to talk to you about Amelia and Zoe. This place is a kindergarten. If somebody's offering you something you need, don't you just grab at it instead of whining about your delicate feelings? What on god's green earth do feelings have to do with anything? It's good for you or it isn't. You agree with me? - Sure. - Something needs doing, you just do it. Otherwise, what good are you? - It's Amelia's baby. - Ethically, it doesn't matter. It's in Zoe's body. Zoe's my patient. I can't breach confidentiality. I hate this. I hate that this baby is sick. I hate that Zoe won't let me even try to fix it... That I'm lying to Amelia, that Naomi's caught up in this again. We're all caught up in it. If this baby dies, then the settlement goes out the window. It's based on these two women bringing these babies to term and then switching. If that can't happen, then we're facing a malpractice suit. So, no. Lying to Amelia will only make it worse. I know that. I tried to get Zoe to change her mind. - Look, Naomi knows them... - Don't even think it. You saw how hostile Zoe is. - Do not bring Naomi in. - I just meant to ask her... If litigation starts again, they smell that Naomi's been involved... - They'll go after her first. - They'll go after her first. So nobody knows what Katie's father said to Violet except Violet, and she's not talking, except to Sam, and not about that. I didn't get a babysitter to talk about Violet. - What do you want to talk about? - Anything but that. We could talk about Charlotte, my benefactor. - You upset because she paid your way? - I love being emasculated. Okay, no Violet talk and no Charlotte talk. You want to bet on the game? If you lose, do I collect from Charlotte? If you could've seen her face. Who knew Charlotte had feelings? Thanks. That helps a lot. You can't tell your friend's girlfriend - that you don't like her. - I know, I tried to dodge her, but she backed me into a corner and kept on telling me all the reasons - why we should hire her and... - We should hire her. - You don't actually like her? - I like her check. I like that hiring her would make Cooper happy. I like that we would be moving forward in at least one area. And I like her specialty. It could be good for business. Look, we have a problem. She is our solution. All right, fine. Let's just get it over with. Hey, up here. Oh, I'm interrupting. I was just leaving, really. Amelia came to see me this afternoon. I was surprised, too, given what happened this morning, but she thinks there's something wrong with the baby, and she thinks that you and Zoe are lying to her about it. I know I'm supposed to be out of this, but... she looks like she's about ready to explode. So... is she right? - Are you lying to her? - There is a problem. - That we can't tell you about. - Okay. How serious is it? - Can it be corrected? - This is ridiculous. We're playing 20 questions. They were Naomi's patients. Like it or not, we are all in this. We either all sink or we all swim. It's a sacrococcygeal teratoma, and it's on the baby that Zoe's carrying. - Can't that be operated on? - I'd like to try, but Zoe said no. Well, that can't be the end of it. - I know you don't want me involved... - Not a good beginning of a sentence. Amelia came to me, and I have to do something. Zoe's mad, but she was my patient, and I do know her. So get me into a room with her and maybe I can get her to change her mind. You guys have to let me try. Thank you for coming. I'm on my meds. I'm myself. I've heard that. So you wanted to see me? How are you? Dr. Turner, I am... I'm so sorry. Please... tell me you know it wasn't me who did that to you. - Please tell me you know that. - Why? So that I'll know you understand that I'm not a monster. - That's why you wanted to see me? - That... and I want you to testify. When Dr. Wilder was on the stand, the jury looked at me like I am a monster. And you think my testimony would counteract that? I think if you testify, the jurors will know They will know that I was crazy that night. - And you'll avoid prison. - I won't get help in prison. I'll slip. I'll be crazy again. I don't ever want to be crazy again. I'm scared. I'm scared of that... That person who did that. It's... It's not about avoiding punishment. It's just... I need help. I need someone on my side. You gutted me like a pig. You ripped my baby out of my body. You left me there to bleed to death, and now I should be on your side? I should care about how sorry you are? I should give a damn about what happens to you? You made my life hell. You made me crazy. And now you want a free pass from me? Please, Dr. Turner. Please! Dr. Turner, please! Thank you for agreeing to see me. I know how angry you are, and how much you blame me - and rightfully so... - I don't want your apologies. Dr. Montgomery said that you had something that you needed to say to me, - so, why don't you just say it? - Amelia came to see me. - You told Amelia? - No, I told you I wouldn't. Amelia came to me. She knows you're hiding something. She knows that there is something wrong with the baby. So now you want to atone by talking me into something that I don't want to do? When all this happened, I did not want to talk you into keeping the baby. All I wanted was for you to see things from all sides. It was not about me. This was so you could feel as okay with what was going to happen as you possibly could given what we did to you, given what I did to you, what I did to you. I wasn't the one who changed your mind. It was Amelia and it was you, knowing that it was the best thing given the circumstances. If the situation were the other way around, wouldn't you want to know? Don't you see? It is the other way around. This is my baby, too. They're both mine. They're both hers. If I tell her now... Tell her that I am going to end this pregnancy... it will be bad for her... Her blood pressure. She's already at risk for eclampsia. I may lose both babies. We'll lose both. Or I could do the surgery, at least try. If you're gonna choose not to have the surgery, then you're gonna have to let Addison end the pregnancy. If you ever want to be pregnant again, it is the safest choice. - And that means... telling Amelia. - Okay, I'll tell her. But you have to explain to her why the surgery can't be done. You cannot put that on me. About Charlotte... she was in a bitch of a mood when I got home last night. - Cooper, I'm sorry. - I don't want your apology. Make a decision one way or another. Is she in or is she out? Come on. We did. We called her this morning. She didn't tell you? No. I left early for rounds. What is it, yes or no? She's moving in to Pete's old office right now. You coulda called me. - Congratulations. - I wanted to surprise ya. Just anywhere except for that one. It goes on the desk. This is... this is gonna be great. Wait till you see what I got going on in here. - Is this what I think it is? - Yes. What is this for? I mean, why is it here? - New job, new specialty. - Porn shop? - Sexual dysfunction. - You're a urologist. That and now more. Look. I hired a web designer. You'll be able to click on a condition, get information. You can do an e-mail consultation, you can order stuff, you can make an appointment to come in. This didn't happen since last night? You been thinking about this one for a while? You didn't think to mention this to me? It just slipped your mind? - It's a work in progress. - What do you call it? What, is it like, genitology? - Can't-Function-Ology? - Sexology. Is that what it's gonna say on your business card... Dr. Charlotte King, sexologist? Kinda sounds a little bit like - a hooker or a dominatrix. - You did not just call me a hooker. No, I said it sounds a little bit like a hooker. - This is a legitimate medical specialty - Really? This? How old are you? Some people have trouble with sex. They need a doctor's help. I emphasize "doctor." You know what? Let's table this. Violet Turner. All right, pick a fist. Come on. Pick a fist. Good. Yes. See? That means you have to answer one question. You still don't want to talk to me? It's not that. I'm just afraid you're gonna pressure me into doing something I don't want to do. But Sam. You talked to Sam. - No pressure. - I will not pressure you. Promise. Okay. What's the question? Why... did Katie's father come in to see you? To tell me that katie wants to see me. And did he really think you were gonna go? I did go. I thought that... If I could face her... just us... then I could face her in the court. Why didn't you tell me? I would've gone with you. How'd it go? I wanted to rip her lungs out, but the deputy was there. That's probably a good thing... for Katie. She wants to me testify. She wants me to say that she's crazy. And... what do you want? Well, Dr. Turner thinks she needs help. But Violet wants her dead. You can have conflicting emotions about a person. I speak from experience. But only one of us can testify. What should I do? I think Dr. Turner's the best psychiatrist I know. But I want what's best for Violet. The teratoma depletes the baby's blood supply, and the foetus can't develop or thrive. And the baby dies? Amelia, I wanted to tell you. I was... Is there anything that we can do except for the surgery? I wish there were. - If I thought that there was a way... - I understand. I do. I do. Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm just... I'm a little light-headed, I think. I'm gonna go ahead and take your blood pressure now. When we first found out we had the wrong babies, I was afraid. I was afraid that you wouldn't try to make it work. Thank you for trying. So what do we do now? I think termination is best. I want to be there. I'm sorry. I know... I know this must be hard for you if you... if you feel... if you feel anything like the... like the way that I... that I feel... Her pulse is weak and thready. Get 4 liters of oxygen going. - I'm gonna get an I.V. pack. - You just breathe. - All right, lean back. Slow breaths. - I'm okay. Is the baby okay? You just had a transient rise in blood pressure. It slowed your heart down, but you're okay now. Thank God. I am such a mess. You just need to avoid stress and rest so it doesn't get any worse. And I am going to call your regular ob-gyn and see about adjusting your medication. - I wanted to be stronger for her. - You are. - Is she still here? - Of course she is. I'll go get her. - How is Amelia and the baby? - Amelia's gotta be careful, but they're both going to be fine. Good. That's good. I changed my mind. I want to have the surgery. I want you to try, as soon as you can. I know. I know what I said. But she is putting her health at risk for my baby. She's doing it for me. I need to do it for her. Did Violet decide whether or not she's gonna testify? I think she will. I just don't know what she's gonna say. I think that she should... ix-nay on the iolet-vay... I've backed off. Will she? Won't she? It's not my concern. If you want to try to change her mind Not me. Katie. Katie wants her to testify, - tell the jury that she was crazy. - Is Violet actually considering... Can we talk about something else? Charlotte is going into sexology. - How crazy is that? - I don't think it's crazy at all. - She didn't tell you? - What, you knew? Of course we knew. She didn't tell you? Dude, you gotta work on your communication skills. Besides, I think she'll be good at sexology. - I'm assuming... - That is exactly the problem. - It's a medical specialty. - That is so not the point. You said you wanted her in the practice. As a doctor, Sam. As... Excuse me. May I have another one of these, please? Hey, listen. It's Brad. If your girlfriend told you that she was gonna be a sexologist, would you be okay with that? Where have you been? I had a party. A gin party? With Brad the bartender. Did you kill anybody on your way home? I'm a responsible adult. I took a cab. You know, I decided it's a good thing that you're a sexologist. Really? It's gonna be like a peep show for me at work. You can put on your little leather teddy, and I can watch through the window while you do what you do the way that you do it, because you're really good at it, and you really should be putting your skills to good use. Just please wear a condom. You get nasty mean when you're drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm clear. And I'm happy for you. I'm just... I'm confused... How do I introduce you now? Because there's no page on this in Emily post. I mean, how about this? " This is my girlfriend Charlotte." "Do you need help with your erection? " You know this is my bed, right? That I paid for! Take it all, Charlotte. Leave me nothing but shame and mortification. - The mass is almost as big as he is. - You've done it before. But usually when I go in, I'm trying to save one baby. In this case, I feel like I'm trying to save two, and one's not even in the room. - If I lose the baby... - then you will have done everything you possibly could, which is what we wanted. We wanted to try everything. If this doesn't work, it won't be good for you. Don't put that on yourself. Just go. It's not your mistake that got us here. You know what she's gonna do? I'm glad you're here. All rise. Should it be taking this long? Addison will come and get us just as soon as there is news. God, I hate waiting. I felt this way every time we finished another implantation and I came in for a pregnancy test. Just panic. Sheer panic. Amelia, I am so sorry for what I've put you both through. I didn't mean to bring up something that's Please, don't try and make me feel better for what I've done. It was hard at first, for all of us. But Zoe and I... It's crazy after the way it happened, but I'm closer to her than I've ever been to anybody before. You did that, too. Zoe's fine, but I couldn't save the baby. I'm so sorry. I did everything I could. I do. Are you comfortable, doctor? Are you kidding? I appreciate you coming back. I know this is hard on you, so I'm gonna get right to it. Can you tell us what happened on the night in question? The defendant rang my door, and when I answered it, - she jabbed me with a syringe. - Do you know what was in it? I remained conscious, but I couldn't move. And then she told me what she was going to do to me. And what did she say that was? That she was going to cut my baby out of my body. And she did. Will you tell her it's gonna be okay? She doesn't believe me. You're gonna get through this, Zoe. I just feel like I failed you. - I feel like I lost my baby. - It is not your fault. Listen, all of this, it just happened. Okay? Come here. Michael is still here. Your baby is fine. He's in here kicking. And we're a family, so it's gonna be okay. We can do this together. You'll see. My God, are you okay? The baby? You come back now? This isn't right. Now that the baby's gone? No, Amelia, it's okay. - He left you. - No, I called him. I wanted him to come. I'm so sorry you had to go through this all alone. I wasn't alone. I don't know what else to say. I'm sorry. I'm back. I'm sorry that I didn't call you sooner. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - I am so sorry. I'm just the surrogate. - You're much more than that. - I thought I was. Her husband's back. That's... that's good, right? - But I gotta go. - No, Amelia. They can have other children. They can have other kids. Lots of kids. He is not your baby. You cannot just leave and keep him. Yes, I can. He's not yours. He's all I have left. The last thing I remember was her walking out of the door with the baby. Nothing more? Just blood. I remember the blood... Spreading out... All around me. Thank you, Dr. Turner. You and Dr. Wilder were treating the defendant, is that right? And you felt it was safe for her to stop taking her medications? She refused to take them. She was afraid that they would harm the baby that she was carrying. Did you understand that she had an illness that required medication? I understood that she could benefit from medication. - Did she understand that she would... - objection. Speculation. Your honor the witness is not just a victim. She was the defendant's psychiatrist. She's an expert in mental aberrations. I'll allow it. Were you aware that without proper medication, your patient would likely lapse into a delusional state? - Likely is not quite the right word. - All right. Do you think it was possible for her to become delusional? Your honor, counsel is trying to blame the victim - for not being clairvoyant. - I'll rephrase. Dr. Turner, in your expert opinion, on the night in question, was the defendant delusional? Yes, she was. Dr. Turner. I hate what you did to me. So do I. So why? Because you were right. It wasn't you that night. If I had said you were just... Evil... It would be like denying everything I do. More than anyone, I'm supposed to understand that you weren't you. And I do understand. Because I'm not me either. I hope you get better. I hope you get better, too. Perfect. You give her our baby she walks away and there's nothing we can do. - God knows what she's gonna do to him. - She's not gonna hurt the baby. She stole our baby. How can you be this calm? Calm? I just lost a baby. And we're gonna find her and we're gonna get it back. I wasn't talking about that baby. I was talking about the one I was carrying. - Her baby. - Hers. Mine. I know it's hard for you to understand, but when a child grows inside you, - you feel like it's yours. - You're defending her? - I'm understanding her. - What? What are you gonna say now? Because you know the settlement's out the window. This was never about that, for either of us. What? That's our baby. And we'll get him back. We will. She's a good person. She'll look at him and she'll know the right thing to do. - How can you excuse her? - You rush in here after months of being away, and you're just happy that I'm okay. But Amelia was there for me through the hardest thing that I have ever done. She tried to make me feel better when her baby died. Martin, you're my husband, and I love you, and I am so glad that you're back, but she is my friend. And I know... I know that that is gonna mean something to her. Just watched Violet testify. She did great. Calm, focused... she just said what happened, that hell that happened to her. And then she told the jury that Katie was not mentally responsible. I don't think I coulda done that. I'm sorry. I love you, Charlotte. I am too much woman for you. I have more money. I picked a specialty that makes you nervous. I bought your way into the practice. I'm strong and I am comfortable with being strong and I like that I'm strong. And if that is too much woman for you, if that makes your junk feel tiny, I'm not gonna make myself smaller. I'm not gonna put myself in a box so that you feel like a big man. I am a big woman, and you either get used to it or you get out. I'll get used to it. I will. I will get used to it. You are hot. Strong women are hot. It's hot. I mean it, Cooper. I am not... I've given you space and time. I've been raising our son by myself. I quit my job to make things easier. I did all these things so that you would have time to get over what happened, so you could move past it. Today you had a chance... you had a chance to make a huge step past it and make Katie pay for what she did to you, and you, What... I mean, what, what was that? - Did you want me to lie? - She's always going to be dangerous. She's gonna make someone else believe that she's fine, and there's a chance she could do this again. That is an unacceptable risk. After what she did to you, you... you help her? I didn't do it for her. I did it for me. What she did to you was unspeakable. And she needs to pay for what she did. She needs to... she needs to pay for it. I've been so in my head, I didn't realize... - What? - That it... That it happened to you, too. What Katie did to me happened to you, too. I'm not the only victim. You're the victim, too. I'm sorry, Pete. I'm so sorry. She took something from you. She took me from you. - I'm so sorry. - Don't be sorry. Just... Come back. Come back to me. Come back to me. You have to come back to me, okay? Just come back. I don't think I could be that forgiving. I couldn't either, but good for Violet.
