{\pos(250,268)}pair up, you know, that we have to be in couples. {\pos(250,268)}And love, marriage, you know. Marriage was invented as a financial transaction, and it does not make you whole. And a lot of marriages end in divorce. Most marriages end in divorce. I'm divorced. You're divorced. Marriage is stupid. My life is mine. - Right? - t's a good life. Right. Last night I stayed home with my cat. We ordered sushi and learned about the Kombai tribes of New Guinea. Good times. I need sex, like I need water. I'm in a desert. And it's not actually the sex that I miss, which I would be very grateful for, let's be clear about that. It's just that feeling, you know, of being alive. I mean, the flutter that you get in your stomach when you first kiss someone and your lips part your tongues... Stop. Just stop. I gotta sit. I need it, too, but if you tell anybody... I won't. What if you had said yes? - Yes to what? - In med school when I asked you out Right. What if you had said yes? I couldn't. I mean, Nai was my best friend, - and she had a huge crush on you. - I know, and so I asked her out and then we got married, and then we got divorced. Derek asked you out. You got married and you got divorced. So I'm asking you now. What if you had said yes? Do you think that we would've had a shot at making it? - Me and you? - Me and you. Help me! Help me! Over here. - What happened? - My wife... All right, pulse and respiratory rate are rapid. I have no signal this deep in the canyon. Use mine. All right, tender on the right side. - He's losing a lot of blood. - My wife... We're gonna call her just as soon as we can, sir. Our car crashed. I tried to get help. She's over there. Help my wife. Thank God you came. My name's Addison. I'm a doctor. - Where does it hurt? - Everywhere. And we're stuck. Can you... Could you get us out? Where's Jake? Did they get him to the hospital? Jake's with my friend Sam. He's a doctor. Let's try to get you out of this car, okay? I can't. My... arm is... stuck. - Can you feel your fingers? - I could yes-yesterday. Now they're tingly. I'm worried about the baby. You've been here since yesterday? It was getting dark when we crashed, and Jake left before sunset. When he didn't come back, I was afraid. Thank God he made it out. We found him about 50 feet up on the hill. He was out there... all night? But I thought you were here to get me out. It's just you and... your friend? You can't get me out. Listen to me. Jake is alive. Sam is helping him. But I need to check the baby. Now when's your due date? Today. I'm due today. Saison 03 Ã‰pisode 06 The Hard Part</i> {\pub}{\pos(192,210)}We close early on saturdays. {\pos(192,230)}Brendon got married today, dude. - Mazel tov, Brendon. - Mazel tov! {\pos(192,230)}You know, you can't drink in here, you guys. {\pos(192,230)}Your wedding day's a big day. {\pos(192,230)}You might not want to be so drunk that you forget it. {\pos(192,230)}I'm not drunk. I have a problem. {\pos(192,230)}It's my wedding night, and Melissa and I, {\pos(192,230)}tonight will be the first time. Okay. You're virgins? {\pos(120,230)}We figured it was important to make the first time, you know, {\pos(192,230)}- special. - That's sweet. {\pos(120,230)}I'm sorry. Did you need something? {\pos(120,230)}I didn't want to take a chance, so {\pos(250,268)}I took these pills right after we said "I do". {\pos(192,210)}I was hoping they would kick in by tonight, and they did. {\pos(192,230)}But it's been up for, like, 3 hours. And my mother-in-law tried to hug me... {\pos(192,230)}- How many did you take? - Four, maybe five. This is the sexology place, right? {\pos(192,230)}She's dehydrated. I'm afraid of vascular collapse. {\pos(192,230)}- The baby's okay? - She says she can feel movement, {\pos(120,230)}but I can't angle in to hear the fetal heartbeat. {\pos(120,230)}There could be a placental abruption. I don't know. How's he doing? {\pos(192,210)}Broken rib, he's got a deep gash to his thigh, bleeding internally, he's bad. I gotta get help fast. {\pos(192,210)}You think you can get outta here before dark? {\pos(192,210)}If I run, maybe. It took us 3 hours to get in. {\pos(192,210)}All right, I'll just go back and forth between 'em, {\pos(192,210)}try to keep them both stable until you come back with help. {\pos(192,210)}All right, I'll put a pressure dressing on him {\pos(192,210)}so he doesn't bleed out, then I'll go. {\pos(250,268)}Go fast, Sam. {\pos(120,268)}Which one of you has the erection? Priapism's no joke, fellas. If I don't get that mast down, - this boat might never sail again. - You wanna walk my plank, captain? {\pos(120,268)}What's your name? {\pos(120,268)}Let me tell you the procedure for reversing priapism. {\pos(192,210)}First I take a long-gauge needle, and I push it down the head of the penis, then I slowly draw out blood, flush it with saline and repeat. {\pos(120,268)}Still the man, Dan? {\pos(120,268)}Now who has the erection? {\pos(192,210)}Nice to meet you. Follow me. - Oh, God. - Sorry, man. It's okay, it's okay. As long as you're taking care of Kara, it's okay. {\pos(192,210)}You both survived a really horrible crash. {\pos(192,210)}- The baby seems okay. - I thought I could make it out. {\pos(192,210)}I thought I could do it, you know? {\pos(192,210)}All right. Addison will be back to check up on you. What's wrong? I can't breathe. Damn it. You've got a collapsed lung. All right, I'm gonna have to make an incision in your chest to relieve some of this pressure. This is gonna hurt. Here we go. Stay with me, Jake... {\pub}- You need to drop 'em. - I can't. We're dealing with a ticking clock here. The longer you wait, the greater the chance of permanent vascular and neurological damage. Do you want your Johnson to fall off? He's a virgin, and it's his wedding night. What's that have to do with anything? {\pos(120,268)}I think standing in front of Maria Sharapova {\pos(120,268)}with a pitched tent is a little like cheating on his bride. {\pos(120,268)}That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. I'm a physician, {\pos(120,268)}- and we have a tennis court reserved. - What if I came in, {\pos(120,268)}if I was there, sort of like a chaperone? For his penis? Fine. Just get his pants off. I think you might want to... change your clothes. Does that hurt? This is my fault... The crash. A bee flew in the car, and I grabbed Jake's arm. - I didn't mean to. - It was an accident. - That hurts. - That's your rib. It's probably broken. That ought to make delivery really fun. My vote is for a C-section in a hospital. I second that vote. Jake wanted a home birth. I told him that's fine as long as the baby come outta him. - What happened? - Almost. Collapsed lung. Easy. There we go, there we go. I had to improvise a chest tube. He's stable, but we have to keep opening the tube every half an hour... Or he'll arrest. I brought him here so - you could watch both of 'em. - What's happening? Tell her I'm okay, please. He's okay, Kara. - It's gonna be dark soon. - I know. We had a hard enough time finding the trail during the daylight. The car came from somewhere. I'm gonna try to find the road. I'll be fine. All right. What's happening? Nothing. It's just, Jake's having... Hit the brakes! - Did he drop his drawers? Thank you. - Gowned and waiting. - You scared me. - I thought everybody had left. - Charlotte and I had a late walk-in. What are you doing here? I had some work to do. It's saturday night. It's not like there's a lot happening at home. - True. - What did you do to him? It's not our fault. Don't lie to me. - Have a beer. - I don't want a beer. - Everybody just calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down. This was supposed to be the best night of my life, and they've ruined it. My wedding reception is going on right now, and there is no groom! You seem very upset right now. Maybe we can go somewhere and have a talk? Is it true about... his thing? It's not funny! It's my wedding night. Come on. I'll take you to your husband. I'm okay. - I'm still here. - Are you okay? Is she okay? - You're bleeding. - What? - I hit my head. - All right. - It's nothing. I'm okay. - Let me take a look at it. - I can't open the door. - What? - I can't open the door. - Here. Help me. - The rock is blocking the door. - Help me! Can you get out that window? If you can't get out, I can't leave. Jake, his tubing... it'll clog... And he will die. What? - What is it? - Nothing. - All right? - Trying to figure this out. We're gonna have to... probably gonna have to stay here through... - wait out the night. - What? {\pub}Bourbon, neat. Can I get you a drink? Thanks, but I've got one coming. Sorry that took so long. That bartender was a total... - What are you doing here? - Having a drink. I can see that. Why are you here? Just like you, trying to have a little fun. - Maybe I should go. - Wait. Thanks for the drink, shelly. - Shelly? - She came up with that on her own. Hope I didn't ruin your game. Don't worry about it. I wasn't that interested. - So you trying out the single life? - I am single. - Right. Of course. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. You and Violet... - Stop. I am not going there. Tonight is about good booze and single women, period. - On the prowl, are you? - You know... - Trying to prove a point? - It's a big bar. Ookay, but look, we're colleagues now. Aside from that thing that once came between us, there's no reason why we can't be friends. Maybe we would've been friends if not for that thing we won't talk about. I doubt it. - You stuck a needle in his... - It's okay, baby. It didn't hurt. She froze it first. And so our next option is to insert a shunt - to redirect the blood flow. - A shunt? That sounds big. It is, but it's what I got. Otherwise I'll have to deglove the penis. Deglove? I make a circular incision around the glands, roll back the skin and squeeze out the blood. Oh, God! - Feeling better? - Yeah, a little. So... how long have you been pregnant? This wasn't supposed to happen. When we made our virginity pledge, everyone made fun of us, said we were freaks. But we liked being different. It was our way of saying what we had together was special. The fact that you couldn't keep your promise is understandable. No. You don't get it. We made a pledge. It's a big commitment. One that's difficult to keep. That's what Jenny said at my bachelorette party. - Who's Jenny? - My sister. She and her friends were telling stories about their first time, how much it hurt. They said I should just do it, just get it over with. That way, it would be great when I was with Brendon. - It's not Brendon's? - I thought if the wedding night were close enough, brendon would think it was. Is that the kind of marriage you want, a relationship based on a lie? You're gonna have to tell him. I'm gonna go get Jake. That way I can help you and him. Will he make it through the night? - Yes. If the tube holds, yeah. - Good. That's good. It hurts. Something hurts. I think I'm bleeding. It's not blood. Your water broke. You're in labor. You've played before. I lived for a while on an army post. There wasn't much to do at night except go to the bar, drink and play darts. - You were in the army? - National guard. I was called up as a reserve doctor when we invaded Iraq. See any action? Stationed at a veteran's hospital - in Landsthul, Germany. - I saw some action in Bosnia... doctors without borders. Had some pretty close calls in the field. I'm sure burning sage in a war zone's - quite dangerous. - Is there something you want to say - about the type of medicine I practice? - I think I just did. Look. You lose. - Let's go again. - I'll take your money all night. You're way out of your league on this one. We'll see about that. What are you doing? I'm hoping that Violet gets Melissa to come clean with Brendon. She's pregnant by someone else. - And Violet is involved why? - Because Brendon needs to know. Violet should mind her own business. It was just... Good. This is good. This is gonna be good. - What do you think you're doing? - Talking to a patient. - She's not your patient. - Excuse me? She's my patient's wife. He came in for a stuck penis not a relationship-ectomy. No one asked us to insert ourselves - in their personal life. - Melissa is upset. - I am helping her to figure out what... - No, you are doing nothing. No one is saying anything to anyone. It's my patient and my penis. Something's wrong. That's funny. Everything's wrong. The force of the impact shifted the baby. - He's in a breech position. - What does that mean? Is he okay? It means that his legs are pointing down. I can't deliver him in this position without turning him. Don't move. Hold still. I'm gonna try to flip the baby. It's gonna hurt. Stop. - Did it work? - I'm sorry. - How are you doing? - The baby... It's a footling breech. I can't move him, and he's coming. - How long? - Soon. And even if I do manage to turn him, I don't know if I can deliver in this position. - We can't wait till sunrise. - I know. I'm afraid we're gonna lose all three of them. What are you doing with my tackle box? I'm trying to give you as much time as possible while I'm gone. The tubing's loose. If I can sew it into your skin, - it won't get pulled out of place. - Which would kill me? I think it'll give you more time. You promise me you'll, come back, right, and bring help for Kara? I promise. Let's get it over with then, so you can go. Okay, everyone. Visiting hours are over. Let's go, Melissa. I want her to stay. That's fine with me. - I'll be outside if you need me. - Will you stay? Please, so I don't freak out. Great. Party in procedure room one. I know this might sound a little forward, but I saw you from over there, and I think you are... stunning. You have this unstoppable sex appeal. You know, you're like the niagara falls of sexy. - That was... terrible. - Horrific. - I'm Sheldon. - Dawn. - Can I buy you a drink, Dawn? - I'd like that. - A margarita. - A beer and a margarita, please? While you're at it, I'll take a bourbon straight up. - Thanks. - You two know each other? - We're colleagues. - Doctors, actually. - I'm a doctor. Sheldon's a shrink. - A psychiatrist, which means I have medical training and emotional depth. - I bet you're very easy to talk to. - He is. It's kinda like talking to your dad. Gee. Look what time it is. Shouldn't you be getting home to your baby? - You have a baby? - I'm a single parent. - And at his age... - I got it... I got it. Put your money away. I'm gonna let you two work this out. - Excuse me. - If you insist. Great. Thank you. Bringing up Lucas... Low blow. - You drew first blood. - If you can't stand the heat, get... See, that's the difference between you and me. This isn't a game to me. I actually like this girl. I think she's nice and funny and smart. And you'd take her home just to prove a point. - Excuse me? - If I'm allowed to use the name, I think you're still in love with Violet. You know what I think? I think you're projecting. You're the shrink, I think maybe it's you who's still hung up on her. I am a shrink, and clinically speaking, we would call what you just said an evasion. In layman's terms, you're a liar. You love her. And when she comes around, you'll regret this. The shunt's almost in. Just a few more minutes. This is our wedding night, and I've ruined it for you. - Don't say that. - If this doesn't work, - we'll never be able to do it. - It's not your fault. I just wanted you to think that I was some kind of rock star in bed. I wanted you to think I was worth waiting for. There's something I need to tell you. - Maybe now is not the time. - Now is definitely not the time. I'm pregnant. We had a pledge. We agreed... Wait. You did it with someone else?! I have a sharp instrument inside you. If you ever want to use it again, - I suggest you stop squirming. - How could you?! - She made a mistake. - This marriage is over. - We can talk about this but... - Everyone get out now. All right. Okay, let's go. I sewed the tube in. He's exhausted but stable. How's the labor? It's progressing quickly. Okay, don't fall or get hurt or do anything that might cause you to die in this canyon. - You have to come back. - Okay. All right. Be careful. {\pub}{\pos(192,220)}I feel something! Oh, my God. I feel something. {\pos(192,220)}What is it? {\pos(192,220)}It's nothing. {\pos(192,220)}Tell me. Just tell me. It's bad enough without you not saying things. The baby's foot... it's come out through the cervix. His foot? I can't deliver him like this. He'll die. He's not fully engaged, so I need to push him back up through the birth canal and try to invert him from the inside. - What? Are you kidding me?! - It's bad, but you can do this. Just take a deep breath. I'm gonna be right here with you, all right? And we're both just... We're both just gonna breathe. Take a deep breath. Okay, ready? No, I can't! I can't! Stop! Stop! Stop it! Kara, don't give up on me. I need you to try. You can do it, baby. You can do it. - No, I can't. - Oh, yes, you can. You're the most stubborn woman I know. It's not too hard for you. - We can do this. - No, I don't want to. Please. Kara, listen to me. You know how most times... You're the one who's always in charge of us, right? You decide where we eat, what color the baby's room's gonna be, where we're gonna go on vacation. And it works 'cause I trust you and I know you want what's best for us. Now it's my turn. I'm the one who's in charge. I'm in charge of us, and I say you can do this. So you have to do this. It's my turn, okay? I know what's best. You have to trust me. Kara... you have to do this. - Just do it. - All right? Let's try again. Okay? You ready? Okay, here we go. Come on. A little bit more. Almost. Yes! What just... what happened? Did she do it? We did it! - I love you, Kara. - Oh, I love you, too. Hey, Melissa's in my office crying her eyes out. She says she won't leave until she talks to Brendon. He doesn't want to speak to her. You're gonna have to get him to change his mind. I get it. You're a meddler. You like to meddle. Meddling makes you happy. But when it comes to my patients, I'd prefer you stayed away. We use a team approach here. That means we share advice or suggestions or anything that might help the patient. Brendon came here for a case of priapism. Now look where he's at. Look where they're both at. They start the day their whole lives ahead of them, happiness within their reach, and... - then it's shattered. - And who shattered it? Who got her to open her yap? I think you're afraid. I think you're afraid of getting to know your patients. So you put on the tough southern girl act, because to feel what they're feeling... That would mean feeling something. Is this the part where I break out the kleenex cause you think my heart's darker than Texas coal? Our patients come here for healing, Charlotte. So... whether that means a pill or a bandage or a needle or a conversation, it's the same. We listen, and when we can, we respond. That's what we do here. No. It's what you do here. You just gonna stand there all night? Is there something else I should be doing? I think it's customary for the guy to make the first move. I get it. This is the move. You do nothing while you wait for me to come to you. It worked, didn't it? Your friend Sheldon, he doesn't play any games. - His approach is straight up. - And yet, here you are talking to me. Sadly, I have a weakness for guys who make me work for it. Maybe it's time you tried dating a nice guy instead. You do get that I wanted to leave with you? Here you are... With Pete. - Actually, she was looking for you. - You were? Really? Yeah. I thought that maybe we could grab a bite to eat, - get out of here. - I'd love that. I will grab my coat and, meet you at the door. Okay. It looks like I got the girl this time. Looks that way. I'll see you at work monday. Good news, Brendon. Not only are you flaccid, I found no evidence of vascular or neurological damage. You know, I thought I married the virgin Mary. Turns out I married Mary Magdalene. I know your heart feels broken clean through right now, but... if you walk, you might regret it. Not after what she did. I'm... Not warm... And feelings are. So I'm gonna just tell you this thing, 'cause here we do that. We tell you things, and sometimes it helps you. Oh, for the love... Anyway, here's the thing I want to tell you. I was married... Once. I married the first man I truly loved. Thought we had this whole fairy-tale thing going on. It was. He was... amazing. We were amazing. And then he did something... Something stupid and thoughtless... Something mean... The kind of something I was not willing to forgive. So I left him. I left him behind and I went on and I live this whole other life now. And it's good. It's fine. I have a great guy, I'm a doctor. My life is damn near perfect. But every once in a while, I think about that guy and the fairy-tale thing we had and... I wonder if we'd still be amazing if we were together now. And I'll never know... 'cause the minute it got hard, the minute it stopped being a fairy tale... I cut and ran. Real life is hard. Real stuff takes work. Real life is sometimes thoughtless and mean. But that doesn't cancel out the love. So if you don't love this girl, walk away. But if you look at her and you know she's the one... You owe it to yourself to give her a second chance. - Lift your butt then push. - No! I can't move. The baby can't come out, Kara, until you push. Now lift. - You can do it. You can do it, baby. - I can't! Kara, look at me. Kara, look at me. We are both trapped in this car. We are both scared... terrified... all right? But you have a guy outside this car who is waiting for you. You have a guy who loves you. Now if you don't do what I tell you to do, you will die. You will die on him. Now if I die, nobody's really gonna care. They'll care, but they won't be broken. If you die, you will break him. Jake will be broken. Someone loves you. So we're not gonna sit here and debate this. When I tell you to push, you are damn well going to push! Right? So push! Push! Good. All right. Good. Baby's out. The baby's out. How is he? Is he okay? Is he okay? Oh... no. He can't be... You have to help him. You have to help him. Help him. You have to help him. - He's okay? - Well, first of all, someone missed something on the ultrasound, because he is a she. And, yes... She's okay. She's so beautiful. - And everything's... - Ten fingers, ten toes. Jake, we had a girl. Jake, it's a girl. Jake, your daughter is gorgeous! Can you hear me? Do you see him? Is he moving? Get the repelling team! Sam! We had the baby. But jake... how's jake? Tell me he's alive. Tell me! He's still alive! EMT's almost there. We're gonna have to pull him up in the helicopter. Give me a backboard, IV of normal saline and 02 on a rebreather. - You got it. - Way to hang in there. We're gonna get you outta here. You're gonna be in good hands, man. - Well done. - Careful. Listen, I don't want to go, okay? I don't want to go... - She's right behind you. - I don't want to go without Kara. She's gonna catch up with you at the hospital. - Take care of Kara. Promise me. - I got you. Good job, buddy. So they're gonna have you guys outta here in a couple of minutes. - How is he? - He lost a lot of blood, - but I think he's gonna be okay. - And the baby? Paramedics have her on O2. She's nice and pink. - You guys did good. - Door's coming off now. - We need you to stand clear. - Thank you - Just, thank you. - You don't have to... I do. And I swear, when we get outta here, I am naming that baby Addison. That's good. That's good. I'm bringing 'em in. All right. Hold up! Hold up! - Sam! She's crashing. - She's losing blood! The pressure from the door must have tamponaded the wound. She's crashing! She's crashing! Brendon, I know you're still angry. Damn right, I'm angry. I'm pissed... And humiliated. I'm so sorry. I never wanted to see you again. But? But... I look at you, and... I'm not ready to walk away. I love you. Keep off it for a couple days. What just happened here? Guess he didn't want to give up on her. Now that was a long night. Who's up for some food? - My treat. - I'll go get my stuff. So that was a good thing you did, convincing Brendon to give her another chance. Is there any privacy in this office? Does Cooper know you were married? I wasn't. Brendon and Melissa are back together. They're happy. That's all that matters, right? Why don't I believe you? - Let it go, Violet. - Were you lying? You know, it's not actually morning, but I think I'm having pancakes. - I'm having banana pancakes. - On second thought, I think, I got a lot of work to finish up, so... Charge the paddles. You heard me. Charge the paddles. Addison, it's been 20 minutes. She's gone. She's gone. Addison. Addison! She's gone. Get me outta this car. I want out of this car. Get me out. Get me out of this car. Get me out of this car! Get me out! Get me out of this car! I have something I need to tell you. I know it's a bit early for scotch, but... It's 5:00 somewhere. Oh, boy. You remember when medicine was simple? We could save people's lives, people didn't die and... Bad things didn't happen. Bad things always happen. So me and you? You never answered my question. Do you think we would've made it? Oh, I don't know. I don't know if we even had chemistry. I was just a geek going for the hot girl. I was the hot girl? You were hot. You weren't a geek. You had not Naomi.
