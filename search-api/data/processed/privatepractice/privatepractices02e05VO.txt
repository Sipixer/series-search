Right? I Love Irresponsibility. Mm-Hmm. Mom. Dad? Are You Getting Back Together? Yeah. Absolutely. Uh-Huh. Yes. We're--Yeah. You Should've Seen Maya's Face, Man. It Was Like Christmas, New Puppy, First Car All Rolled Into One. What Was I Supposed To Say? Are You And Naomi Ready To Get Back Together? I Mean, I Just Got Single. I Haven't Sown Any Oats. I Can't Get Over The Feeling That I'm--I'm Missing Something. Like? Like An Ex-Lover Jetting In And Making Me Look Like This One. No, Love, Companionship, That Is Not A Step Backwards, That's A Step Forwards. It's Like Taking Off The Condom, And Taking Off The Condom Is Good. Metaphorically. So You Can Do That, Let Go Of The Betrayal, Everything He Put You Through? Yeah, Well, You Know, We Both Played Our Part. But I Don't Know. Now It Just--It Just Feels Right. We're Sam And Naomi. Sam And Naomi, Together Again. Yeah. You And Sam, You're Getting Back Together? Nai, That's... That's Great. That's Amazing. Thank You. So I-I Hear, Uh, The Mean, New Boss Lady Is Calling A Morning Meeting. Oh, Now. She's Not That Bad Once You Get To Know Her. $487,000. What Does That Mean? That's How Much We Need To Keep The Doors Open. And You Have A Plan? A Plan That Doesn't Change What The Practice Is Supposed To Be? I Do, Actually. Starting Monday, Our Doors Will Open One Hour Earlier, And We Will Close One Hour Later. We Will Also Be Working Weekends... Saturdays From 9:00 To 1:00-- Um, I Have A... S-S-Sure. And In Addition, I Will Be Asking Each Of You To Take On Extra Responsibilities To Help Generate Income. What About Me? You Will Be Working With Me To Find The Extra Money. Pete, We Have To Go. It's Jenna's Day. Jenna's Day. That's Today? Oh, My God. It's Jenna's Day. Wow. Jenna. Jenna? Tell Her I Said Hi. Who--Who's Jenna? Saved The Practice. You're Welcome. Hey, Can You Set Up Two Blood Draw Kits For Me For This Afternoon? Sure. That's A Whole Lot Of Condoms. Planned Parenthood. Addison's Helping With Their Community Outreach, And They're Free. Go Ahead, Cooper. Line Your Pockets. No, I'm Good. Oh, You're Good With Condoms? Yeah. So It's Over... Between You And Charlotte? I'm Sorry. What? No. What? Oh. <I>Oh.</I> You're Being... Monogamous? You're Being Serious With Charlotte? Really? Charlotte? Yeah. Here's The Part Where You Say, "Congratulations, Cooper. I'm Happy For You." Uh, I Have To Go. An Old Friend Is In From Out Of Town-- A Really, Uh, Really Good Friend. Okay, Jenna, I Am Aspirating The Follicular Fluid. So Tell Us About The Wedding. You Have A White Dress And A Big Cake? Yeah, Strawberry. Oh. Look At My Wedding Ring. It's A Karat... Wow. A Whole Karat. It Was Her Grandmother's. Oh, Please Tell Me You Brought Pictures. Now We Need To See The Pictures. I Have The Album In The Car. I Will Bring It Up. It Was The Most Amazing Day Of My Life... Until Now. And I Am Done. You're Done? You Got My Eggs? Uh-Huh. (Pete) Hey, Nick. (Nick) Hey, Guys. Hey, Nick. Hi, Sweetie. I'm Sorry. Practice Ran Late. Hi. She Got My Eggs, Nick. Wow. It's Really Happening. How'd She Do? She's A Trooper. Oh, Great. What's Going On? Egg Retrieval. Is There An Office Pool On How Many Eggs We'll Get? No, It's Jenna. That's Jenna? (Cooper) Yeah, We've Known Her And Her Family A Long Time. How Old Is She? All Right. 17. Wh--Uh, Why Are We Doing Egg Retrieval On A 17 Year Old? Because She's Dying. And We're Giving Her Her Last Wish--A Baby. (Laughs) Oh, Look At You. Oh. Look At You. Assistant D.A. Wasn't Impressive Enough? You Had To Run For Congress. You Big Show-Off. (Laughs) Oh. It's So Good To See You. Is Everything Okay? Yeah, The Campaign's Going Well. I'm Up In The Polls. So The Other Side Wants To Bring Me Down, You Know? They're, Uh, Calling My Law Professors And Ex-Boyfriends. No One's Called You, Have They? No. And Even If They Did, You're Safe With Me. We've Always Had Each Other's Backs, Right? Through Good And Bad. I Need Help, Vi. Okay. Well, If Things Are Tough Again, Then I Recommend Someone, A Therapist, Discreet. Not That. Well, Tell Me. Anything. I Need You To Destroy My Medical Records. -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ°ÇãÇé·îÏ×==- ±¾×ÖÄ»½ö¹©Ñ§Ï°½»Á÷£¬ÑÏ½ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒµÓÃÍ¾</Font> -==Http://Www.Ragbear.Com==- Ë½ÈËÕïËù µÚ¶þ¼¾µÚ5¼¯</Font> -=ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ»×é=- ·­Òë: Ð£¶Ô: Ê±¼äÖá£º²Ý¸ùÃ»Å® Â¼ÖÆ£º¸öÈËId</Font> You Remember Freshman Year? You Kidding? You Know, My Mother Had Just Died, And You-- Yeah. Well, Yeah, I Never Told You, But... (Sighs) Christmas Break... I Admitted Myself To St. Ambrose. I Had Shock Therapy. Why Didn't You Tell Me? We Poured Our Souls Out To Each Other. Well, I Was Too Embarrassed, And I Just Couldn't. But Now... You See My Problem. Shock Therapy Is Not A Big Deal. Oh, Well, Maybe Not To You, But Voters Won't See It That Way. Everyone's Seen "Cuckoo's Nest." Shock Therapy Equals Lobotomy. No, It's Different Now. E-Even The American Psychiatric Association Says That-- (Laughs) The Voters Won't Be Reading The Annals Of The A.P.A. Well, They're Not Gonna Be Reading Your Medical Records Either. All It Takes Is One Reporter Flirting With A Nurse At St. Ambrose. That's How Politicians Are Ruined. But, Oh, If Those Files Could Disappear... That's How Doctors Are Ruined. I Could Lose My License. Violet, You Know I Wouldn't Ask If... Please. I Would Do Anything For You. I Just... I Need You To Do This One Thing For Me. You're Implanting A Baby In A Baby? Jenna Is A Married Woman. She's A Teenager And She's Dying. How Long Does She Have? A Year Or Two. And What Then? Addison, You Don't Know This Girl Or This Family. We Do. Jenna Was One Of My First Patients. Cutest Kid--Every Appointment, She'd Bring A Doll With Her, And Whatever Boo-Boo She'd Have, She'd Put It On This Doll, And She Wanted To Mother It. She Doesn't Need A Living Doll. She Needs To Be Living What Life She Has Left, Making The Most Of It. Well, For Her And Her Family, "The Most Of It" Is Having A Child. Violet Has Seen Jenna's Parents Through This Entire Process. And They Went From Watching Their Only Child Die To Hope. Aren't We, In Effect, Creating An Orphan? Jenna Has Parents And A Husband Who Loves Her. Maybe It's Young Love, But It's Real. Is She Even Strong Enough To Carry A Baby? Do You Really Think That We'd Be Doing This If She Wasn't? I Think That You All??? I'm Just Not Sure That You're Doing The Right Thing. Is--Is This What It's Gonna Be Like With You In Charge, Questioning Decisions We've Already Made? Because We <I>All</I> Talked About This Case Last Year, And We Decided That If She Could Get Through Chemo And If She Were Strong Enough... Wait, There's A Healthy Egg. I'm Gonna Grab Some More. I'm Gonna Get Nick Into The Donation Room. All Right, In 24 Hours, She Could Be Pregnant. Addison. Hey, Addison. Naomi Was Making A Dig At Me. I Mean, What, Just Because, What, Because I Haven't Been Here As Long As The Rest Of You-- Naomi Is Just Being Protective Of Jenna. We All Are. Look, Maybe From The Outside, It Seems Crazy, But What We Have Been Through With This Girl-- Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Sam And Cooper Got Her The Best Oncologist. She Did Radiation, Chemo, Bone Marrow. I Threw The Kitchen Sink Of Alternative Treatments At Her. She's Dying. But She Is Holding On For This. Naomi Was Not Making A Dig. It Felt Like A Dig. She's Trying. Just... Leave The Jenna Thing Alone. (Dell) Do You Have Any Idea How Much Money We're Owed In Overdue Accounts? How Much? $142,000. That Is Great. That... That Is Real Money. Do You Want Me To Get A Collection Agency On It? What, And Give Them A Huge Cut? No. You Have The Ledger. You Call 'Em. I Need An Enforcer, Dell, Someone To Call The Patients, Motivate Them To Pay Up. An Enforcer? Enforcer. Are You Busy? Actually, I'm Waiting For Somebody, But-- So My Friend Asked Me To Do Something Terrible, And I Don't Know If I Should Do It. Well, In Fact, I Know I Shouldn't Do It, But It's A Friend. Wait. By "Friend," Do You Mean Guy? And By "Something Terrible," Do You Mean Something Anal? Cooper, It--It's Kara Wei. She Asked Me To Destroy Her Medical Records. Kara Wei--The Kara Wei? That's Your Friend You Went To See This Morning? Yeah. It's From College. She's My Best Friend. I'm Your Best Friend. Look, She's Not Your Best Friend If She Wants You To Destroy Her Medical Records. Well, There Was A Time We Would've Done Anything For Each Other. You Know, I Went Through Some Very Bad Times, And She Was There For Me. So You Should Put Your Career At Risk? I Owe Her. She's Not Your Best Friend. I Am. You Were. My Having Charlotte Doesn't Mean That You Don't Have Me. (Laughs) And You Cannot Do This. You Have To Tell Her What You've Told Me A Million Times. Stop Sleeping With Skanks? (Charlotte) I'll Let That Pass. Oh, I Didn't Mean-- I've Got Half An Hour. Let's Do This. We'll Talk Later. Yeah. Right. Look At Your Calendar. (Laughs) Okay. Hi. Hi. You Know, About This Morning, We Should, Uh, We Should Probably Talk. We Should, Absolutely. Later. Right? Okay. Hey. Hey. I Could Have A July Baby. That's A Good Month. You Have A Daughter, Right? Maya. She's A Few Years Younger Than You. It's The Best Thing, Huh, Being A Parent? Yeah, It Is. It Feels Like The Only Thing I've Ever Wanted--To Be A Mom. You Are So Ahead Of The Game To Know What You Want So Clearly And To Go For It. Most People, They Put It Off Or Make Excuses. Maybe You Don't Get The Perspective Of How Good, How Precious Life Is Until It's Too Late? But This Is The Only Life You Have, Right? Yeah. Oh, My Gosh. I'm So Sorry. Oh, It's--No, It's Fine. The Basket's Over There On The Cart, For Your Cup. Oh. Uh, Thanks. Uh, Are You Jenna's Husband? Yeah, Nick. I'm Dr. Montgomery. Addison. Nice To Meet You. Oh, The, Uh--I Couldn't Figure Out How To Turn It Off. Don't Worry. I've Got It. (Chuckles) Are You Okay? Yeah, I'm Sorry. It's All Just A Little... Weird. I Mean, Most Of The Team Went Out For Pizza After Practice. I Came To Get Jenna Pregnant. Yeah, You Should Be, Uh, Dealing With College Applications And Making Your Parents Freak Out Over Wild Parties. Well, I Mean, Parents Aren't Really In The Picture. Uh, Lynn And Garry-- Jenna's Parents-- They Took Me In. We've Been Dating So Long, I Was Already Part Of The Family, So It Works. Can I Ask You... What Happens After? After? When I Was 17, I Couldn't Have Done What You're Doing. Have You Thought This Through? Are You Going To College? Well, Uh, I Want To Go To U-Penn, And My Guidance Counselor Thinks I Can Get A Scholarship. That's Great. So Then Will You Bring The Baby With You, Or Will Jenna's Parents Raise The Baby? I Mean, How Will You Be Involved? Will You Fly Home Weekends Or Holidays? What Happens When She's 10 Or 15 And She Asks Why Her Father Didn't Raise Her? Well, Garry And Lynn Want To Be Parents Again, And Jenna Wants A Baby, So... You Are Gonna Be The Father, Nick. What Do You Want? No, I Won't Call Back Again. We've Sent You This Bill Three Times, And We Need You To Pay It. It Wouldn't Have Hurt So Much If You Didn't Tense Up. I Didn't Know You Were So Afraid Of Needles. Shut Your Mouth. If You Tell Anyone, No Cornfield For You. Oh, There Will Be Cornfield. How'd The Job Interview Go? Okay. It's Not Out Of State Or Anything, Right? You're Not Going Anywhere? I Just Took An H.I.V. Test For You. Why Would I Go Anywhere? So... It's Business, Coop. Let's Focus On Pleasure. (Whispers) Cornfield. (Naomi) I Am Injecting A Single Sperm Into Your Egg. She's Making Your Baby, Sweetie. (Gasps) Look At That. Our Grandchild. Now Over The Next 48 Hours, The Cells Will Divide And Multiply To Form An Embryo. That's My Baby. Um, Take A Picture. Take A Picture Of Us For The Album. Sure. Okay, Nick, Get In There. You're Gonna Be A Dad. Nick? I'm Sorry. You've Been So Good To Me. You All Have, But... Nicky. I Don't-- I Don't Want To Do This. I Don't Want A Baby. All Right, What Would Be On Your Listof Things To Do Before You Die, Coop? Am I Dying? Did You Get My Test Results From Dell? No. What-- Nick, Please Come Out. I Really Want This Baby. (Nick) We've Barely Had Sex. Babies Are Supposed To Come From Sex. (Jenna) My Parents Can Hear You. (Garry) It's Okay, Sweetie. Nick, I Mean It. You Promised. This Is Perfectly Normal. It's Fertility Stress. I Didn't Say Anything. (Pete) I Got The Key. Nick? I'm Coming In. Okay. What Are You Doing? You Wanted This. You Wanted This. They Wanted This. But Like She Said... What About What I Want? Fine. Go. It's Okay, Honey. No, I'll Do It Without Him. I'm Sorry, But We Can't Use His Sperm Without His Consent. That Fertilized Egg Can't Be Implanted. That's Not Fair. No, I Need This Baby. It's Okay, Honey. Come On. Let's Go Sit Down. He Was Scared. We Were Talking. He Had Reservations. No, You Didn't Approve Of What We Were Doing, And So You Sabotaged It. He Needed Someone To Talk To. I Was Being A Good Doctor. Do You Want To Pick Up The Pieces Of That Girl Now? I Told You To Back Off. I Could Use You On My Campaign. (Laughs) Consultant For My Health Care Policy-- Affordable Coverage For Everyone, Including Mental Health. I Have Heard Your Stump Speech. That Is Not Why I Asked To See You. Well, It May Be A Stump Speech, But I Believe In It. I Can Make Things Better, Vi. Which Is Why I Don't Think You Should Hide From Your Past. I'm Not Hiding. You Have An Opportunity Here To Do Good, To Embrace What Happened To You, To Go Public. Is That What You Did? Well, That's Different. Is It? This Is Something From My Past I Want Kept Personal. Mental Illness Is Nothing To Be Ashamed Of. Neither Is Rape, But You Chose To Bury It. And I Held Your Hand Every Step Of The Way. I Know. I Know You Were There For Me. But Burying This... Is Not Good For You. Hiding A Secret, Walking Around Worried About When The Other Shoe Is Gonna Drop, It's Gonna Eat You Up. And I Am Not Talking About Kara Wei, The Congressional Candidate. I'm Talking About Kara,My Friend. You Can Stop It Now, Violet. When--When I First Met You, And Your Mother Had Just Died And You Didn't Talk About It And You Buried It, It Almost Did You In Until You Opened Up To Me, And Then You Got Help. And Then I Opened Up To You And I Learned The Same Lesson. This Is Different. No, No, It's Not. You Are About To Be In A Position Of Power. Think How Many People You Could Help If They Knew That It Was Okay To Talk About-- I Have Plenty Of People I Help. Hell, I'm <I>Surrounded</I> By People Who Want My Help. I-- I Came To <I>You</I> Because I Thought You Would Help <I>Me.</I> I Thought We Did That For Each Other. Hey, Did You Get My Patients' Blood Work Back From The Lab? Uh, Not Till Tomorrow. These Are Rapid Blood Tests! You Know What I Would Like Before I Die, Sam? I Would Like A Lab That Delivers Test Results On Time. Wait. That Wasn't The Point Of My Question. It's About Life. It's About Living. I Sat There Today With A Girl Who's Dying, Who's Not Afraid To Live. And Me-- This Is About Naomi. Yes. I Shook Up My Whole World Because I Felt I Hadn't Been Living, All Right? And What Do I Do? Nothing. Now I'm Talking About Getting Back Together With Naomi Without Ever... You Know, Stepping Off A Cliff. You Want To Step Off A Cliff? I Want To Do Something Big. What Did You Have In Mind? Get Ready To Step Off The Cliff, My Friend. Okay. Okay. Yeah, That's Badass, Isn't It? Yeah, Congratulations. You've Crossed The Same Threshold As Every 10-Year-Old Girl In America. What's Happening? That's Awful. When Did He Leave You? That's Fine. You Just Take Your Time. Okay. I'm Done. You Know The Economy Is Really Bad, Right? People Are Hurting. Dell-- I Came Back To Be A Midwife, To Do Less Administration. And When We Dig Out Of The Hole, You Will. Right Now Everyone Is Taking On Extra Duty. They're Doing More Medicine. ?? We Need A Bill Collector Or The Rest Of The Money. What? You Know Something. Dell? No, I-I Don't. Dell. I Don't Know Anything. William Dell Parker. What Do You Know? We Have Been Killing Ourselves Trying To Save This Practice, And You Have 10,000 Square Feet Of Prime Office Space On The Fourth Floor? It Is Not As Simple As It Sounds. Then Make Me Understand, Nai. The Practice Is At Stake Here. This <I>Is</I> The Practice. This Was Our First Space-- Mine And Sam's. Maya... (Laughs) Maya Learned How To Walk Here. And We Had An Opportunity To Create A Medical Sanctuary. Addison, Look--Cardiologists, Surgical Suites, M.R.I. Suites, A Dedicated Lab. (Elevator Bell Dings) This Was The Practice We Always Dreamed Of. (Sam) The Practice Look, Now The Only Way To Lease This Place Is With A 5- Or 10-Year Commitment, And That Would Mean Giving Up On Our Future. If We Lease It, We Can Pay Off Our Debt, Our Cash Flow Will Be Way Up. It'll Allow Us To Stay Afloat. No--This Is An Issue On Which We See Eye To Eye. We're Not Leasing It Out, Addison. You Are Holding On To Something That We Cannot Afford. And Once Again, You Are Trying To Control Everything. What, It's Not Enough That You've Already Ruined The Last Wish Of A Dying Girl-- You Know What, Nai? Keep It Up. 'Cause Eventually I'm Gonna Stop Caring Whether Or Not You Forgive Me. And, Sam, You Knew About This Place, And You Kept It From Me. Nice. Great. Thank You. Thanks For Backing Me Up. Well, This Is Our Future. So... What The Hell Is In Your Ear? Oh. (Chuckles) It's A, Uh, It's A Stud. You Know, Like Harrison Ford, Michael Jordan. You Like It? Well... (Chuckles) Maybe Maya Will Think It's Hip. Yeah. Hip. Speaking Of, You Know, Maybe We Could Come Over To Dinner Tonight, You Know? And Then Afterwards, You And I Could Talk About Us. Okay, Yeah. Yeah? Sure. Okay. The Kid's 17, And They Want To Use Him As A Baby Factory. If It Was Me, I'd Run Away, Too. Why Should That Boy Want To Be Tied Down? Great. I'm Already Dealing With One Girl Who's Dying. That's Subtle. I Just Want You To Be Healthy. I'm A Smoker, Pete. Take It Or Leave It. The Lab Is Fast... Usually. No Preacher, No Cornfield. Oh, I Needed Sex Today. Me, Too. Violet's Being All Passive-Aggressive. Addison's At War With Sam And Naomi Over Leasing A Floor Of The Building. We're Doctors Fighting Over Leases, That's How Broke We Are. Yeah? Tell Me Why You're Looking For Jobs? I'm Not A Doctor Anymore. I'm An Administrator. I Need More. I Need... Oh. The Interview Today Was Really Interesting. It Was... What? Never Mind. Hey, We Can Still Be In The Cornfield. Come On. Finish What You Were Saying. I'm Your Friend, Possibly Your Best Friend, And We Still Don't Have Any Condoms. No Need. (Sighs) I'm Pure As The Driven Snow. I'm The "Everything But" Girl... Who's Waiting For Marriage. And You... Are The Horny Field Hand. And We Can Only Use Our Tongues. So If I Lease The Fourth Floor, Then Sam And Naomi Hate Me. But If Don't, The Practice May Go Under. So You Lease It, Right? You Make It Sound Easy. I Lead Guys Every Day. A Leader Makes Tough Decisions. Sometimes That Means Pissing Off A Friend For The Good Of The Group. Oh. I Want People To Stop Being Pissed Off. Well, You Need To Decide Who You Want To Be-- A Good Friend Or A Good Leader. You're Smart. I Don't Like That. Yes, You Do. Do You Want Me To Eat Noodles Off Your Back? Yes. Please. (Laughs) (Maya) So Are You Gonna Move Back In, Or Will We Move Here To The Beach House? I <I>Love</I> The Beach. Uh, I-I Don't Know. I Don't Know, Honey. Are You Gonna Have Another Wedding? (Laughs) That'd Be So Cool. (Clears Throat) Well... Um... You Know, It's--It's--It's-- Your Dad And I Have A Lot To Discuss. Oh, I Know. I'm Just Really Excited. Yeah, Uh... Come On, Eat. Where You Going? You Don't Want To Know. No. Violet. Don't Do This. If She Was Your Friend, She Wouldn't Be A-- Last Night, I Stayed Up Alone And Watched Starving Teenage Girls Vying To Be Supermodels. What Did You Do, Coop? (Plastic Crinkles) (Elevator Bell Dings) Best Friend, My Ass. Hey. Hey, Sam. Hello. Hey. You Want To Know How I Spent The Rest Of My Night After You Rushed Us Out Your Door? Answering Questions That You Ducked All Night. We Talked. Yeah, About Algebra Tests And Piano Lessons. We Were Supposed To Talk About Us. I Know. I'm Sorry, Nai. I, Uh, I Been Trying To Figure Some Things Out, And I... Wrote A List. What Is This? The Things I Want To-- Things I'm Going To Do. "Climb Mount Kilimanjaro"? Yeah. With Or Without Your Inhaler? H--Don't Mock My List. "Learn To Sail"? "Drive Through The Badlands"? Yeah, Yeah. What--What--Is This-- Is This A Midlife Crisis? Or--Or Is The Prospect Of Us Getting Back Together Making You Want To Hop In A Car And Drive As Far Away As Possible? This Isn't About You.?? And--And What About The Timing, Is That Coincidence? (Elevator Bell Dings) 'Cause We've Been Apart A Year, Sam. Dr. Bennett. Yes. (Naomi) Yeah. We Have A Few Hours Left On The Eggs. I Still Want This Baby. What About Nick? He Never Came Home Last Night. (Lynn) We're Really Worried About Him. He's Probably At The Stupid Arcade. I Want This Baby. If I Can't Use Nick's Sperm, I'll Use A Sperm Donor. A Sperm Donor Is Not What We Talked About. Yeah, But We Agreed?? We Agreed To Get <I>Them</I> Pregnant. Well-- A Sperm Donor? You Know, Addison, She Is Still Dying. This Doesn't Change Anything. Well, I'd Say It Does For Nick. Or Do We Usually Allow Wives To Pick Out Sperm Donors When Their Husbands Don't Even Want Kids? Look, All Naomi Is Trying To Say Is The Family Wants This. Her Husband Is Her Family, Too. Doesn't He At Least Deserve To Be Here To Be Part Of This Decision? Addison, Can You Just Mind Your Own Business? No, No, This Is My Business. God, I Hate This. What, She--She's In Charge, And--And So She Thinks She Gets To Be Right About Everything? I Think The Real Problem Is... She Is Right About This. I Need A File For A Patient Of Mine-- Kara Wei, W-E-I. You're Really Doing This? You're Stealing Files? You Followed Me. Friends Don't Let Friends Steal. Oh, Don't Even Go There. Okay, Don't Take It Off Hospital Grounds, Don't Leave It Laying Around, Put It In My Hands When You're Done. Hospital I.D.? Look At Me And Tell Me Um, I Don't Have One, But I Do Have Privileges Here. Well, You Can't Have The File Without I.D. And You Can't Do This. Do You Have I.D.? I Can Vouch For Her. Dr. King, This Good Clerk Has Rules-- Dr. Freedman, I Assume You Have The Results Of Our Patient's Blood Work. No, I Don't. Well, Why Don't We Go To My Office So We Can Call And Find Out What's Taking So Long? My Patient Is Anxious. I'm Consulting With Dr. Turner On A Matter-- No, No, No, No. Violet-- Go. ?? I'm Not Talking About This Anymore. Jenna Still Wants To Have A Baby. She's Looking At Sperm Donors Right Now. If That's What She Wants... It Isn't What You Want? None Of This Is What I Want. I Said I'd Do This. I Want Her To Be Happy, But... She's Dying. My Girlfrie-- My Wife Is Dying. I Mean, I'm Just A Kid. I Don't Know... She's All I Have. I Just Want Us To Be Happy, Not With A Baby, Just... Just With Each Other With The Time She Has Left. Then You Gotta Tell Her That. Let Go Of What You Think She Wants To Hear And Just... Just Tell Her The Truth. I Told You Everything. I Poured My Heart Out To You About Everything That He... Did To Me. But You... You Told Me Nothing. She's Dying, Nai. I Know That. You Can't Control It. You Can't Stop It. And Even If The Idea Of This Baby Makes You Forget About It, It's Not Going Away. This Is Not About Control, Because If We Were Gonna Talk About Control, We Might Talk About You. You Know What, Nai? It's A Two-Way Street. And I Want To Get Past It. I've Tried To Get Past This. You Need To Decide, Are We Gonna Get Past This Or Not? Because You're Holding On To Your Anger Almost As Much As You're Holding On To That Dying Girl. I Am Not Holding On To Her. This Is Her Dream. And Her Husband Doesn't Want To Take Her Dream Away From Her, And Her Parents Don't Want To Take Away That Dream, But <I>You</I> Are Her Doctor. You Have To Stop Holding On, All Of You Do, To Her, To The Idea Of The Baby, To The Fourth Floor. This Is Not Wrapped Up Together With That. That Is Different. That Is Our Future. That's One Future, Just Like Nick And Jenna And The Baby Is One Future, And Now They Need To Find A New Path. Some Dreams... You Have To Let Go. She Always Used A Belt. The Buckle Hit My Teeth Once, Knocked Four Out. I Was 16. I Could Defend Myself. But My Brother Robbie Was 9. She... Put His Hand On The Stove Because She Said He Mouthed Off. I Couldn't Watch Her Do That To Him. The Judge Said It Was Self-Defense, And He Sealed The Record. I'm Sorry This Happened To You. That's Why I Was Depressed And That's Why I Needed Shock Therapy. And That's Why I Need You To Destroy Those Medical Records. Destroying This File Won't Change That It Happened. It Doesn't Matter How I Defend It, Violet. The Headline Will Read, "Congressional Candidate Murdered Mom," And I'll Be Done. You Can't Make This Disappear. Even If The Medical Records Go Awaway, There Are Still Legal Records. I'm A District Attorney. Those Were Easy. Kara-- Why Should I Expect The Voters To Understand When My Oldest Friend Is Judging Me? Oh. Okay. You--You--You Want To Be A Politician? Why Not Be The Right Kind, The Kind Who Makes The Right Choices? Because That's The Person That I Knew. I'm Giving You A-A Choice Between The Person That You Want To Be And The Person That You Are, Between Our Friendship And... Dr. Bennett. Yes. I Think We Found A Sperm Donor We Like. Do You Know Where Naomi Is? We're Ready. I-I Found Someone. Can We Do It Now? Jenna... I Can't. What? I Know This Is What You Want-- You Can't Say No. That's The Problem. I Couldn't. No One Could, Because Everyone In This Room Loves You And Wants To Give You Everything. I Don't Want Everything. I Just Want This Baby. And You Know What I Want? You Know What Everyone In This Room Wants? We Want You Not To Be Dying. But You Are. And When We Talk About The Baby, We Get To Forget And We Get To Take Back Control Of This Big, Ugly Thing. Having A Baby Isn't Gonna Change What's Happening. And The More You Hold On To That, The Less You're Gonna Be Able To Really Live The Life You Have Left With The People Who Love You. I Don't Want A Baby. But I Do Want You. (Voice Breaks) I Don't Want To Die. What? You Should Have Swabbed It With Alcohol. Ugh. I Don't Know What I Was Thinking. Yeah. I Guess You Just Get To A Point Where You Start To Wonder... Wonder About All The Things You Haven't Done. But The Truth Is... I Like What I've Done-- You Know, The Practice, Maya, You. I Want To Spend My Life With The People I Love The Most. Let's Do This, Nai. Let's Move Back In. What? If You Had Asked Me That Yesterday Or The Day Before Or The Day Before... That Would've Been Exactly What I Wanted. We Don't Know Anything Else, Sam. I'm Afraid That We Keep Falling Back Together Not Because It's Right, But... Because... (Voice Breaking) We Want To Hold On To What We Know. And If We Move Back In, It Won't Change The Fact That It Wasn't Working. We Never Really Let Go, Sam. We Have To Let Go. Good-Bye, Sam. Good-Bye, Naomi. How's The Future Congresswoman From California? She's Gonna Be Good At Her Job. You Let Her Have Those Files. I Messed Up. I Messed Up So Bad. I Don't Even Think I Did It For The Right Reasons. I Just... I Just Wanted A... A Friend. Everyone's Living, And I'm Just Here... Alone. And It D--It-- It Doesn't Bother Me That You Have Charlotte. I'm Happy For You. I Am. It's Just... Well, You Have Charlotte. Uh, This Came For You. Blood Test Results From The Lab. Thanks. Well, Open It Up. Make Sure You Have The All Clear. Eh, Later. Right Now I Think My Best Friend Needs Me. (Clears Throat) Look, About The Fourth Floor-- You Know What? Uh, You Were Right. I Need To Let It Go. So, Uh, Go Ahead And Lease It. I Already Did.

Maybe I Was Too Hard On You About The Smoking. No. It's Not About The Smoking. This Is Who I Am. I Drop In, Have A Great Time, Then I Go. Along The Way, I Smoke. Stop Trying To Domesticate Me. I'm Not Trying To Domesticate You. You Are. I'm Not Your Wife. Who Died Before She Could Quit Smoking. Maybe I Should've Told You That. Go. Go To Ghana. But... Come Back.
