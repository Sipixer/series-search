I don't want to hear this again. Working at a private medical co-op, moving to L.A. This is not my Addison. My Addison is a world-class neonatal surgeon. My Addison lives to cut. Your Addison would've been promoted to chief of surgery. So stop "addisoning" me. I want a change, I need a change, and this is how I'm gonna do it... In L.A., at that practice, with those people. - You don't know anything about them. - I know plenty. My best friend... Naomi... From med school... She's a fertility specialist there, and she's an amazing woman. Mother just needs a moment to herself. Her ex-husband Sam is an internist. You wish you had his people skills. We can't keep doing this. I love you. I do. We're in this together. But, we gotta make a change. Violet is a psychiatrist, and she's incredible... Grounded, strong... Hello. Hello? Violet... you have to stop calling here. I'm married now. Cooper, a pediatrician. One of the best in his field... A pro. Lisa, that... Oh, God, I'm sorry. Lily, right? Your name's Lily, right? Sorry. Yeah. I'm getting a little uncomfortable, if you... Lori! Lori! And Pete, he does alternative medicine. As a surgeon, I don't believe in that kind of thing, but the man is a healer. So I know exactly what I'm getting myself into. You think you're going there and do what? Wear jeans, walk on the beach, dance in your underwear? Maybe I'll dance naked. You belong in the O.R. You'll be back in a month, begging for your job. No, I won't. I am changing my life. Now I can walk away angry, or I can walk away with your blessing. Either way, Richard, I'm going. I'll keep your job open as long as I can. Come here. Sam? Addison? What the... How did you end up getting the house right next door to me? Naomi said that you had the best realtor. Naomi said? Addison, what... What are you doing here? It's... not like I look bad naked. A lot of men have enjoyed seeing me naked. A lot of me... Well, not a lot. I mean... Eight. Well... Eleven. No, here in Los Angeles. Here. I... Didn't Naomi tell you? Tell me what? Oceanside wellness group. - Hi. Dell, right? Where's Naomi? - Yes. - Need to know where Naomi is... - Mr. Wilson. You guys can come on back now. - Hey! - Hi. You moved in, everything good? Yeah, whatever. Naomi... I need to talk to you. So, uh... Hey, Dr. Bennett. Hi. I'm putting my boys in a cup. I'm gonna get Leslie pregnant. I'm ovulating, finally. Oh, congratulations. That's great. Never done it into a cup before. - Yeah. - Yeah. That can be kinda... Naomi. Dell, can you take Ken and Leslie back to exam room number one? I'm gonna be right with you guys, okay? Thanks. - Just in the conference room, please. - All right! Don't worry. Addison. Hi. Nice to see you. Hello. So... What happened to the amicable divorce? It's progressive decompensation of repressed rage secondary to feelings of abandonment. It's shrink talk for Naomi finally getting pissed off that Sam left her. What are they mad about now? Naomi didn't tell Sam that she hired me. To work here? Oh, oh, oh, here he is, all good. Oh, but... Next time you want to hide your vegetables, feed them to the dog. But you can't shove 'em up your nose. It's off-limits as a hiding place. Okay? Mommy and daddy are fighting again. - Addison. Cooper. - Cooper. Remember me? Yeah, I know. Hi, Cooper. Pete, hello. You're back in town. Yes. She works here. - Naomi hired her. - You're working here? Yeah. Welcome aboard. So Naomi didn't tell any of you that I was coming? It's a power play. Naomi's trying to show that she has the power. Why did Addison take the job anyway? Wasn't she some big hotshot in Seattle? Is it just me, or did Naomi just run over us with a steamroller? - Is she crazy? - Naomi's insane. I mean Addison. Is she some kind of crazy person who gets kissed once and decides to change her whole life? You kissed Addison? Really? - Focus! - Focus! Look, I know she has the largest chunk of this practice, but we agreed to equal votes. We are supposed to vote. Sam, you gotta do something. - Yeah. What, me? - This divorce is killing us. You need to apologize. Just say you were wrong for walking out so we can get back to being a happy family. I never... I didn't... I am not apologizing to her. She's the one. Naomi hires Addison and then moves her in right next door to me. - I saw her naked this morning. - You saw her naked? - She look good naked? - Focus! So I just have to get it in the cup? Yeah, just get it in the cup. I want a kid. I've always wanted a kid. But this is just... You know, a lot of our clients are nervous. But just remember, once you have the baby in your arms. - How it got here won't matter. - Eyes on the prize. Yeah, eyes on the prize. Oh, okay. 5-cent tour. Exam rooms... Two is for peds, three has the gynie exam table in it. - You and I will share it. - You didn't tell them you hired me. Oh, they'll get over it. It's fine. Scrub sinks are over there. We contract with the lab downstairs. Nale, I don't think it's right to them. To them, I am the interloper. I don't lope. I own 55% of the practice. I made a decision. They have to live with that decision. - I have to... - They will get over it. Here's your birthing suite. But I deliver babies in a Hospital. You used to deliver babies in a Hospital. Now unless it's a C-section, you deliver babies here. It's very popular with the patients. Okay. I guess I should meet my staff. I don't have a staff. Okay. Let me see if I... understand this. I left a Hospital with a state-of-the-art - A oBgYN wing and a staff of 60... - You'll have Dell. - He's studying to be a midwife. - The cute boy who answers the phone? Plus you'll have Pete. Laboring moms love Pete. The alternative medicine guru? Do you know how many babies I deliver a day? Well, here you'll be lucky if you deliver one. One patient the entire day? I told you, we do things differently here. This may be a big city, but this co-op is about practicing small-town medicine. Every patient is special, every patient gets our full attention. It's not about surgeries but connecting. I told you this. Yeah, I know. I know. I just... I didn't think it'd be one patient the entire day. You wanted change. This is it. Yeah. This is it. Hey, Naomi. We need to talk to you. - I'm just gonna go some... - No, stay. She is staying. You can't just do this. You can't bring in her without a vote. Yeah, this is not... This is not a, uh... - What is that? - Somebody's getting happy. No, it's Mr. Wilson giving a sperm deposit. - Get away from the door. - That's a loud deposit. - Go, Mr. Wilson. - You guys are so immature. - It is... definitely different. - Do you think he's always that loud? Help! Please, come quick. I was just trying to help him get in the mood. Now he's not moving. What's wrong with him? His pupil's blown. He's having a stroke. All right, he's had three rounds of epi and a 200 lido bolus. Defib times 5 on scene. Get out of my way. Hold C.P.R. How long has he been down? Uh, at least 20 minutes. I'm gonna call it. What? What about those? Don't you want the shocky things? He's been down too long. No point to make it a show. No! No! Use the shocky things. I'm sorry. He's gone. Time of death... 9:42 am. No. We... We were gonna have a baby. He was... he was gonna be a dad. I... I want... I want... I want his sperm. He didn't get a chance to make his... his donation before he died. But you can take it from him now. - What? - I want his sperm. I want Ken's sperm now! I get Naomi's mad... Hell hath no fury and all that. I know the practice needs an oBgYN, but since when do we not vote? - I had sex with this woman last night. - The reason we started this practice is to be in charge of our own destiny. Very real, you know, internet sex. But she wanted me to call her mama, but she promised all this really freaky stuff, and I'm talking, like, stuff. Okay. Eww. That's it. I'm done. - No. What? Why? - Because you're a sex addict. Or an internet addict or some kind of freaky addict. Yeah, you're a stalker. You're stalking your married ex-boyfriend. I am not. I'm... Calling him occasionally. - Stalker. - Okay, you know what? That's it. I'm cutting you off, for your own good. I won't help you anymore. - Oh, come on, stalker. - I'm not a stalker! Hey. I, uh... Just wanted to say that I am really sorry about Naomi and the job. I... I got a 911 page. Do you think there's something wrong with, having sex with a woman who wants you to call her... mama? - There's a patient for you. - Thank god. No, not him. You. This is Bill Henderson and his daughter Lucy. This is Dr. Montgomery. She'll be delivering your baby. It hurts. It hurts, doesn't it? It's what you get for getting pregnant. She hid it from me for months, and all of a sudden it's "Daddy, I'm in labor." How about we get you into the birthing suite? Dell, see if we have a chart on Lucy. Hey, can I get in on this? I haven't gotten a lot of field experience for my midwife training. I need the hours. How about you just find the chart? Ken's sperm... You want us to take Ken's sperm right out of... - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - I mean, you can do it, right? - Look here. You're distressed. I understand. Unless you have written consent from the deceased, no way am I gonna let you molest your husband's corpse. Well... Okay, well, let's not use words like,"molest" or "corpse" about her loved one. And it's her boyfriend, not her husband. Well, fine. She wants sperm of a man she has no legal rights to. That makes it all better. No. Okay. Hey, let's... Can we stop... Charlotte, right? You know my name, Sam. Don't act like you don't. I'm chief of staff here, and you know it. You and I, we... We can work on this together. We can figure this out because I'm a good person, you're a good person. We... I mean we can... Right? we can... Together? I did read your book, by the way. - Oh, great. - I took issue with most of it. See, now I'm on her side. We want Ken's sperm, or you got a fight on your hands. That dead man's swimmers are staying exactly where they are. You got a way to fight me on that, I'd like to see you try. I'm calling Naomi on you. Lucy Henderson. She was my patient till she got pregnant. No previous medical problems. It looks good. Well, the dad is mad as hell. I could use your help in there. Oh, Yeah. No. That... down there is not my area. So when the baby comes out, I'd be happy to examine it. Until then, godspeed. Give me two secs to grab my kit. I'll join you. For? If you'd read further in her chart, you'd see she has a holistic birth plan. - Oh, my god. Are you kidding me? - Laboring moms love pete. Hey, listen, um... You moving here... That didn't have anything to do with me kissing you, did it? What? It's okay. It's just that... Well, you should know it was just a kiss. Wait. You think that I moved here because you kissed me? It was a good kiss. It was an excellent kiss. But... Stop talking. All right. I did not move here because you kissed me. Okay. You are actually deranged enough to think that I would pick up my entire life and move because of a kiss? Let me clear that up for you. I wouldn't. Okay. Shut up. Just go in there and do your little eastern voodoo thing you do, and let's help that girl have her baby in peace. What do you expect me to do? He was your patient. My patient's dead. This is about your patient who wants a dead man's sperm. - Besides, I got mad. - You got mad? - I got mad. - You got mad? Apparently neither one of us can make good decisions when we're mad. Another doctor in the practice is a very good decision. We agreed that when we split, we would not let it affect the work. My work is fine. In fact, watch me take care of my patient. Where do you think you're going? If the hospital's not gonna touch the body, then I will. You lay a hand on that man, and I will have you arrested. I'm not a person who plays games, Naomi. You know that. Now please step back. Okay, now I'm mad. I told you. You know, I could help. You know, with Lucy. - I'm good. - You don't take me seriously. You think I'm dumb surfer boy. You think I'm eye candy. You have no respect for me or my midwifery skills. I have... total respect for you and your... midwifery skills? Is... Is that even a word, midwifery? It's a word. It's definitely a word. Jenny? She's been counting the tiles for over an hour. You know this lady? Yes, i do. What the hell happened to her? She had your card in her wallet. Well, thank you. Thank you for calling me. My sister, she's got mental problems. She's a good person, but she's got mental problems. That's why I called you before I called the cops. We don't need the police. I can handle this. Can you do it quick? She can't stay here like that. She's obstructing customer flow and if she's dang... Look, if you give me some time, I will take her out of your hair. Can you do that for me, Paul? Can you do that? - I guess. - Thank you. You're getting charged by the hour, so you might as well hear me. Inhale. Exhale. ooh. Focus on me. Exhale. Deep breaths. In. Out. Good. Good. Much better. My dad, he... He's just mad. I want this baby. I just... I screwed up. I'm such a screwup. Hey, lucy... Listen... Everyone screws up once in a while. And in this room, you get a free pass. Okay? Okay. These are ken and leslie's medical records, including ken's signature on a contract with my office regarding his donation. Now I think that is more than implied. Live consent is different... - You're considering this? - It could be persuasive in a court. Your patient will sign something indemnifying us against legal action? She just wants her baby. Fine. you do the procedure. You take possession of the sperm. Thank you for your help. Well done. Very badass. I know. Right? Get away from me. It's good. - Are you Dr. Naomi Bennett? - I am. You better get that little tramp's claws off my husband's sperm, or I'll sue you and this place so fast, your head will spin. Who are you? I'm Ken Wilson's wife. Jenny, did something happen to make you feel out of control here in the store? We've been working on rage directed toward your husband for leaving you. Are... Are you angry? That's okay. Feel the feelings. Get angry. Let's talk about getting angry. She's not answering. Yeah, I got that, Paul. Now what's the deal? She, uh, gets upset, so she goes crazy with the counting? Well, for many people counting establishes... A sense of order. Oh, my God. When did my knees turn 80? We got knee pads on aisle eight. Hey, Jenny... Can you look up at me? Can you... can you look into my eyes? Come on, jenny. i know you can do this. Aah! whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. - You okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - You sure? - Yes. 10,168. 10,169. 10,170. 10,171. 10,172. 10,17... Just checking to see if you need anything, any help. We're all good. Okay, Lucy, you ready to push? Please. Mr. Henderson, your daughter's gonna start pushing now. Would you like to come and sit by her side? For what? Why don't you just squeeze my hand, if you need to? Okay. - Lucy, you ready? - Yeah. Okay, go ahead and push. Good. Push. Good. Good. Push. That's good. Push. Stop. Stop. She's short of breath with j.V.D. Wasn't eastern medicine your thing? I have a lot of things. Now she's short of breath with j.V.D. Do you want to double-check or you gonna trust me? The baby's in distress. Lucy, don't push now, okay? Just give me a minute, okay? Dr. Montgomery, something's wrong with her. Lucy? Lucy. Lucy, wake up. lucy, wake up. Lucy? Get her on high-flow oxygen. Get an ambulance, Dell. - Just holding her hand. - She's having a heart failure. Ambulance, now! Lucy, honey? Her mom died... in childbirth. She died having Lucy. I'm applying pressure, but the cord is compressed... - She's gonna be okay, right? - And lucy's blood is flooding her lungs, and the umbilical cord is cutting off the baby's blood supply. - I just called the ambulance. - How long for an ambulance to get here? 10 to 20 minutes in traffic. Addison, we don't have 10 to 20 minutes. - I know. - We're gonna lose her and the baby. I know. I thought you might be hungry. You'll have to pay for it. That and the ice pack... and the flip-flops... Thanks. You okay? Yeah. It's just... Look, i know her. She's been coming to see me for months. And she's gentle. Paul! Look, I'm sorry, but I don't think... I don't think you know exactly how to handle this. I do know how to handle this. There has gotta be something here that I'm not seeing, she's not telling me. No offense, but if she's not telling her shrink things, then you must not be very good at your job. You know what? Patients hold things in. They hold things in for years. - What's up? - Just do... Do not touch her. - I'm sorry, Violet. - Paul, think of your sister. Please. - I'm working here, Cooper. - Really? It looks like you're shopping. It's a joke. Dell told me you were here. I just thought I'd come by, see if you needed any help. No, I don't need any help, okay? And you know what? This... you got in your car, you drove all the way down here to see if i was still mad at you? Who is the stalker now? Let's just all settle down. I'm sorry. I gotta let 'em take her. If she gets violent with you again... Violent? She got violent with you? - Come... Just... Your pupils... - Not now, Cooper. This is a psychiatric emergency. I can handle this. I can stabilize her. Just give me a minute and give me backup if i need it. I just feel... If i knew how it started or where she was when it happened... So... How do you figure out how it started? You... You have security cameras, don't you? He told me he wanted to find himself turns out he wanted to find me, only 15 years younger and half as smart. Any idea what that's like? I think I can imagine. Like i don't feel my age, i don't feel scared? Only I feel it alone while he's yanking in a cup for some chick he met hiking in sedona. Maria, i-i know this is unfair. i understand, believe me. You know, i was with him 17 years. Maria, ken really wanted leslie to have his baby. And leslie wants leslie to have ken's money. I don't think that she would do that. I didn't think my husband would dump me. So there you go. If you want protection... Legal protection... I think that leslie would agree to whatever you ask. I don't want protection. i want ken's sperm. What? For myself. Now we'll see who ends up alone, right? Where the hell is the ambulance? - Addison, you have to make a choice. - What do you mean, make a choice? If i wait any longer for the ambulance, i could lose them both. Or i could get the baby out and maybe save them. Save them, of course. Maybe. Maybe save them. Dell, glove up. I need you to decompress the cord. Come here. - Like this? - Yes, that's good. Steady pressure. Okay. I need to be in a hospital. There's no way i can perform a c-section here. It's not sterile. I don't have any surgical equipment... Addison... No extra blood and an epidural would take way too long to take effect. Addison, she's a heathly 17 years old. No one could have foreseen this issue. Do you know what happens to a person when a scalpel slices into them without anesthesia? - Addison, I... - Shut up! I am trying to talk myself into this, and i cannot do it when you keep addisoning me. So just... hold on. Okay. Pete, take over for Dell. Dell, go find a surgical tray from somewhere. She's gonna feel every slice, but we have to try. I'm going to scrub in and find sterile drapes. We have a local anesthetic, right? That will help with the pain. - Stop Addisoning me. - I can treat her so she won't feel any pain. The cameras show her on this aisle. She stopped. Next thing, she's looking at the floor. Maybe some kind of camping accident? Something traumatic? or may... Maybe, you know, this guy, uh, he works here, He told me that marshmallow gets so hot it sticks like napalm. That's not that bad, i guess. Not bad enough for tile counting. They had a house at the lake. I've stimulated the needles. Lidocaine's in. Her pain receptors are blocked. She's ready. Are you sure she's not gonna feel anything? - I'm sure. - If she wakes up screaming in pain... I'm sure. I'm very good at what i do. Are you really, really, really sure? Trust me. Okay. Here we go. I'm gonna cut on three. One... Two... Three... Okay, okay. Okay. Did i or did i not say trust me? You did. And I do... Now. That was good. It was good? There's no time to celebrate. We have to move fast. Both mom and baby are still in danger. She can't just swoop in and take it. She was divorcing Ken's sperm. She was with Ken for 17 years, for God sake. I thought we were on Leslie's side. - You would. - She's your patient. You know, a marriage should count for something. And it doesn't. He just moved on. Oh, come on. Could we please not make this about us right now? I'm talking about ken. he bailed, she got nothing. He died. All things considered, I'd rather be her. You wanna be the one people feel sorry for? - The one who got left? - I didn't... Don't you think for one moment that I have been taking any of this lightly. Oh, no. You walked out. I did not walk out. I said I was unhappy, that I was questioning. And instead of trying, instead of working on it, you just shut the door. You weren't in love anymore. Now how are we supposed to work on that? I never said that. I am not an idiot. I knew exactly what you were saying. So then you fight. You have some passion about the thing. I wanted to see you fight... just once... For us. Naomi, I'm sorry... Profoundly... for hurting you. But you're fooling yourself if you think you're the only one who got left. What are we looking for? Stop talking so i can think. Something in the ad... That's what triggered her. Did you have a boy? Jenny, did you have a son that we haven't talked about? Did something happen to him? Jenny... Did he... Did... Did you lose your son? did he pass away? You're gonna make me lose my place! 25,136. 25,137. 25... - He died. - One. Two. three. One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. Four. one. Two. Three. Four. One. Two. Three. Four. one. Two. Three... If you really want Ken's sperm, you can fight it out. You probably have more rights than Leslie. But with all the legal wrangling, most likely 24 hours will pass, Ken won't be viable... Nobody gets anything. Okay. Let's do that. You honestly never thought about it in all those years, leaving him? Nothing's perfect. But I made my peace. Yeah, I did, too. At least i thought I did. I yelled at him so much... Last time I saw him. God. Maria... At some point, you have to let him go. Oh, okay. Oh, it's a girl. come on, baby. You want to come hold your granddaughter? Welcome, little girl. She looks just like Lucy. - She's in V-tach. - I'm on it. I've gotta close. If she has any chance, I have to close. Charging to 200. clear. - Again. 300. - The paramedics are here. They're bringing in a stretcher. - No! - Clear. We've got an open body cavity in a barely sterile environment. Do not let them cross the threshold until i say so. - Understand? - Got it. - How are you doing there, Pete? - I'm kicking ass and taking names. You? Ass kicking and name taking are on my résumé. Charging to 360. Clear. Start her on a lidocaine drip, 2 migs per minute. 0-2 at 10 liters. hey there. Did I have the baby? Yes, you did. Is my dad... is he mad? No, your dad is not mad at you. Thank you... For... Thank you. Well, that was... Pretty cool. Oh. Dell. Good work in there. I didn't come down here because you kissed me. - Okay. - I didn't. - Okay. - I need you to say it. You did not move down here because I kissed you. You so moved down here because I kissed you. I heard that. Uh, Maria's gonna let Leslie have it. We can do the extraction on Ken. What'd you say? Just that it was time... To let him go. Good. That's, uh, that's good. Okay. Oh, and my book... Was brilliant. His name was Will. Hey, Paul, do you think you could clear out this area, just for a little while... for Jenny? Yeah. i could do that for Jenny. Hey, Jenny. This is... this is Dr. Freedman. He's a... he's a pediatrician. And he's my friend. Hi. I have Will's file here. It says he was suffering from double vision when you brought him in. He was 10. Diagnosed with a brain em glioma. Is that something they could've caught earlier? No, they got it early. But because of the location of the tumor in the brain, it was inoperable. So will started chemo and radiation, and the tumor responded at first. But then... Will developed kidney failure. Well, that happens with chemo a lot. At that point, you and your husband decided to stop treatment. Is that right, Jenny? 574. 575. 576... Making that choice... A lot of people aren't strong enough to do that. These tumors don't quit. Treatment makes kids so sick they can't do anything. And then you didn't come back to the hospital for a few months. Did you go away... To the lake? We all went together. That's what i would've done, exactly. When you came back to the hospital, Will was having trouble speaking... But his spirits were high. His spirits were good. - Sounds like he was a great kid. - Yes, it does. And then? He went into a coma. They made him comfortable. Made sure everyone had a chance to say good-bye. And on the 16th at 5:13 am... They took him off the machines. And... It says you held him and... He breathed on his own for over four hours. That was hard... Holding him like that... For all that time. Will... He had the most aggressive kind of brain cancer that a kid can have. You didn't make it happen. And there's no cure... Only the choice in how you're gonna ride it out. You did everything a great mom could do. No matter how you second-guess yourself, or what your head tells you, you didn't let your son down. You did not let your son down. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. My baby. Bye, honey. Thank you. - She's all right? - Yeah, she's gonna be all right. My assistant. Yeah... I was. - Don't forget to... - Yeah. I'll pay for the stuff, Paul. Thanks... - For coming down. - I'm a better person than you are. The thing is, Cooper... Okay, the thing is that... - I am kind of a stalker. - I know. Why didn't you tell them i was coming? Truth. All right, fine. I need you here. I need you here... Because i'm... Tired and i'm lonely, and my best friend divorced me, and i have no one. I need you here to be my someone. Okay. We want to see you in the conference room... If that's okay... I mean now. We're a team. We're partners, Naomi. You can't just bring somebody in. Without asking us. We're a democracy. We vote. - We vote or it doesn't happen. - You're right. We should've voted. I was wrong. Good. Okay, let's vote. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute. I have been working here less than 24 hours, and in that time I discovered that I not welcome here. I learned I am a one-man gynie show, and I performed crazy MacGyver surgery, And... Sam saw my booty. So... This has not been a great day for me. This day kind of sucked. But you know what? I had one patient... One patient the entire day... And I loved it. So you want me gone? Too bad. I'm in. I'm putting my foot down. My foot's down. It's down. I'm not going anywhere. So... Yeah. I thought I... I thought I had a big finish but... I don't. So... I'm done. No, no. I do have a big finish. If I hadn't been here today, if you'd had someone else, that girl would've died delivering her baby. I saved her life. I saved your asses. I'm a world-class neonatal surgeon. And I'm here to stay. Welcome to the new Oceanside Wellness. That's why I didn't tell you she was coming.
