all right? I'm okay. I'm okay. Just get it out. Oh, good. You're here. It's happening fast. How are the girls? Getting settled. Good. A nurs took some blood, though, Which didn't go over too well with niki. They're okay? They're already complaining about the food. Renee, you ready? On three. One, two- aah! Oh! Aah! I guess he's as anxious as you are. Oh! He's perfect. Trevor, right? How's the cord look? It looks good? Yeah. You want to hold him? Let's just do the cord. Okay. Now there's the magic. We did it. What are we doing here, dink? Uh, could I get some water? Maybe after you get to the point. R- right, yeah. Just cut to the chase. I mean, you're- You're a little scary, dr. Bennett. And if-if I'm gonna be a good father, Then, you know, I-I need to learn to stand up to you, Say what's on my mind. Anyway, uh, you know, the reason why I'm here- Or the reason-the reason why I came here- dink! We've talked, maya and me- Maya and I. Well... We want to do the right thing. I- I want to do the right thing. We want to get married, sir. I've come to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. I need coffee. Well, you're gonna have to wait. Lucas was up half the night. Me, too. I'm seeing someone- a reference librarian. She's very well-informed. So you're dating, sheldon? I'm going to assume that was said without sarcasm. So, yes, pete, I am dating. I have moved on with my life. I am seeing more women now than you would believe. I take lucas to the park. He's like a magnet. Well, that's mature- using your son to get dates. The only problem is, after I get home from work And get him down, I'm-I'm too exhausted. I guess that's w you've got, um... On your shirt? Oh. Spit-up. I'm turning into "that guy," aren't I? Naomi, I need to talk to you. Dink came over to see me. I don't want to talk about anything named dink. Well, we need to talk, because dink w- He wants to marry maya. I'm sorry. I have a patient. We need to figure out what's going on with our daughter, Who is pregnant, in love and wants to get married. I can't, not now. Oh. What's her name? Monica. Monica. Mm. What happened to serena? Really? You're gonna give me a lecture? I'm trying to get my life back. No. I was gonna say, it's nice to see you in a good mood again. well, it's easy to be in a better mood. Oh, my god. Monica... She can, uh... Ooh. You think I care about your sex life, cooper? I'm sure you can click a mouse, google a bimbo. No. You know what? I wouldn't do that, Because I think talkin about my dating life In front of you at work would be inappropriate. But you know why I'm talking to my friend violet about it at work? Because I can't talk to her About it at her home becausyou live there. Yes. I was invited to stay. You're getting back at me, Punishing me by taking my best friend. Cooper- See, this is the problem with you. You think everything in the world is about you. Sorry. Not about you. I don't-you don't- you don't see this? I mean, you are enabling her. Are we gonna have that fight again? You should've been happy that we broke up. You should've been helping me dump her stuff out. Instead... You're letting her get between us. She's not between us. She is. Hey. Who's this? Oh. hello, niki. Hello, kelli. I'm your little brother. Nice to meet you. You're weird, dr. Freedman. But my brother's cute. Oh, thanks a lot, big sister. Thank you, doctor. you're welcome, sir. We have leukemia. We're not stupid. Fair enough. Well, your mom and dad are up in the birthing suite, And they said they'd be down in a minute. How long do you think till they start our chemo? Well, uh, we have to check the cord blood And count the cells - hey. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. All right. I will be right back. So - hello, dr. Montgomery. Do you need a consult or... no? It's a little shtick I'm doing with the girls. I don't have to... The cord blood is a perfect match, But the cell volume's low, really low. I had the lab run it twice, After everything we've done, but... There's only enough to save one. why can't you Split the blood between the two of 'em? Well, if you give them less than they need, They'll reject the graft. We had a baby. We had a baby to save their lives, And it worked. And now what? What we're saying is, We can only give one of them the cord blood. No. I won't do that. Renee- I won't choose to let one child live and another die. I won't! Okay, we could delay the transplant. We could try another round of chemo. The chemo isn't working. I'll have another baby. It took over a year To get the embryos with the right h.L.A. The girls just don't have that kind of time. I'm sorry. We can't do this. Live with the idea that we, what, Loved one more, let one die? I... I mean, what do you suggest, We flip a coin? I mean, how else do we choose? Try to figure out which one's more deserving, Which one's gonna live a better life? I mean, they're 8 years old! Renee... You're 15 years old. I thought we were catholic. Oh, you're really gonna try use religion against me now? Because as I recall, The church promotes abstinence. That's no sex before mage. I made a mistake. A lot of people make it. Dink and I... We're trying to make it right. And the baby should have a mother and a father. Fine. I will not kill dink. The baby will have a father. But you're gonna stay in school. You're gonna have a life. Your mother and I will provide for you. Dink isn't... He doesn't have to take care of you. He doesn't have to. He wants to. He loves me. We're m.F.E.O., dad. You're what? Made for each other. Ugh. No. I need one of you to sign a form To let us do it. A form? Well... that is not going to be happening. You're not listening. I love him, daddy. I'm having his baby. I'm going to marry him. No, you are not. okay. She is mad at me. She's the one who's 15 years old, pregnant And wants to get married, her mother won't speak to her, But I'm the bad guy. Well, like it or not, sam, In seven months' time, one of these is coming out of her. Huh? Yeah. There you go, buddy. Hey, buddy. Man, it's hard to believe they all start out like this. He gonna be okay? Yeah, aside from the fact That his parents don't want to see him. It's like they blame him for... Not being savior enough. He was all they could talk about for the last nine months, And now they just want him for spare parts. They really have to choose which girl to save? I know. It's awful. Right now they're willing to let both girls die When they could save one. I mean, how's that make sense- To have a cure and not use it? Parents can be pretty screwed up sometimes. Mm. Nai is gonna come around, sam. Ooh. There we go. You guys are gonna get through this. Well, sam, w- why don't you, um... Tell naomi what you neefrom her? And that way, she can hear it from you. Okay. I know, uh, that this marriage is crazy. But it's either that or adoption. No. Maya could move in with one of us, And-and we could help raise the baby- no. Or we could pay for everything And-and help her live as-as normally as possible. No, sam. No. No. I am sorry. I am doing the best that I can, but I'm not like you. I can't hold her hand through this process. I'm not holding her hand. Sam, you are treating this marriage like it is A real possibility. I didn't say that. Did I s- Did I say that? I don't think he said that. I- I didn't hear it that way. Uh, I know an unwanted pregnancy Can wreak havoc with a relationship. Uh, but-but you two can get through this Without tearing each other apart. You wanted me to come up. I came up. Please. You can't even sit here and talk about the issue... This bis coming. I don't like it. You don't like it. But it's coming. All the choices are bad. I know that. But we can't bury our heads in the sand, And you can't sit there and say "no" to every sug- That's not an option. You know what? Right now, I'm sorry. Right now, you know what? That is all that I have. Great. That helped. Well, you know, these things take time. Absolutely, absolutely. I think that was a- a good start. "for till that was finished"... She's drawn her line in the sand. There's nothing to do. Hey, you two... You have hung together through this from the beginning. Don't let this get between you. It's an impossible choice. No one could make it. The thing is... I can. We all saywe love, And I love my girls, both of 'em. But put a gun to my head... And I could. I could choose. What does that say about me, hmm? What kind of man does that make me? Honey. I love niki with all of my heart, And if I could give my life to save hers, I would. You know that. Just-I can't watch them both die. This isn't fair, renee. It's not fair for any of us. No! Give the cord blood to kelli before she gets worse. No. I won't allow it. Either they both get it or neither. Renee- no! You're going to hell. She's probably right. I've been doing the same thing... E- ever since dink mentioned the word "marriage." Doesn't take a doctor to diagnose my headache. Corinne davis. Sam bennett. Please have a seat. Is maya's mother going to join us? Uh, no. She-she- she's tied up. Oh. Okay. Well, um... I- it's just me on... On our end, so... I- I know this is all awkward and awful. But she's lovely, your daughter... and funny. I- I do love seeing them together. You know maya? All the time she spends at our house. Huh. They came to me after you said no, And we talked. And, um, I have a guesthouse in the back. It's not huge, but they could move in there. I- I work during the week, So we're gonna have to figure out some kind of day care. But I-I come home early, so I could help. And dink-he'll come home after school Or after his band practice or something, And-and, um, I don't know maya's schedule, But between the three of us And-and you and your- well, maya's mother, And whatever you're willing to do, I think that we can try to help them... Make this work. So then, you're behind this? You're behind 2 15 year olds getting married And playing house? I know it's crazy. I- I'm just trying to figure it out For myself, too, you know, and... M- maybe it's crazy that it's crazy, you know? I mean, we try and teach our kids responsibility And-and that family is important. I mean, for most of history, This is when kids got married. And-and in some parts of the country, it still is. Okay. Excuse me. Uh, I don't- I don't know your son, Hardly at all. But my daughter? E's just a little girl. And she doesn't need a husband. She certainly doesn't need a house. Uh, what she does need is a high school education. And she's going to get one. That's exactly what I'm saying. If she gets married, She'll have someone else to think about, And her choices will be limited. Or she'll have someone who supports her in those choices. Look, I know that you are against this, But if you don't sign these papers, What happens then? What happens if they run off or-or worse? Look, this isn't what I wanted for my kid either. But I would rather have them close by, Right or wrong, So we could pick up the pieces no matter what happens. oh, thank god you're here. You gotta help her. What's happening? Can someone take kelli out of the room, please? I don't want to leave her. It's okay, baby. Just go with the nurse. Okay, she's septic. I need a c.B.C. And a chem panel times two. We're gonna set up a central line. What's wrong with her? She has an infection. She may have relapsed. oh, god. Oh, my god. Get away from her. Renee. You said it, and it happened. This is all your fault. I didn't make this happen. You said it,d it happened. Get out! Come on, baby. Who's buying? I got dying twins. I just spent the last three hours Stabilizing one with sepsis. I've got a pregnant teenage daughter Who wants to get married. Family trumps patients. Hey, did I mention that the dying twins' father Wants to save his favorite, The mother wants them both to die, No one's talking, no one's getting better? I've got a pregnant teenage daughter Who wants to get married. Okay, I'll buy. Oh, no, no, no. I think she's looking at me. Unh-unh. I just sent her a drink. Doesn't look like she needs a father figure. Don't kid yourself there, pal. Being a single father is awesome. Now that I finally have a couple of hours to myself, I'm... I am that guy. Mnh-mnh. Aww. I gotta go. So, um... So would it be okay if I ditched you? You're not very good company. Just buy me another round. I'll be good. All right. Charlotte. Guess you're not going out tonight. It's comfortable. And, uh, no, I'm not going out tonight. I thought you were going out, moving on from cooper. I don't need to whore around like cooper To prove I'm over him. Hey, charlotte, I had a book here. Jane austen? You're actually reading that? Yes. Snuggie, jane austen... I was gonna make martinis, But maybe you want some warm milk. Book's on the shelf along with the catalogs, Next to the mail and the coupons. You ever put anything away? You gonna make those martinis or what? I think you only like me for my martinis. I think you're right. You know cooper's wrong, right? About me doing this to hold on to him? Yeah, absolutely. 'cause you did invite me here. I did. And if you don't want me here... No, no, no. We're, uh... We're good. Hey. Hey. Would you mind driving me to work tomorrow? I have-I left my car at the bar. what bar? I have no idea. I am drunk. Yeah. I picked up on that. I like- I- I like being drunk though. It makes me cl-I feel clear. It gives me clarity. Oh, yes. Well, medically speaking, That's exactly what alcohol does. It makes you sharper and more focused. No, that's for you. I'm being serious. Did you figure out the whole maya thing? No. That's-that's the clarity. This whole thing sucks. I have a 15-year-old daughter who is pregnant, And I can't do a damn thing about it. And I'm pissed. I'm a little sad. And I keep... Sh-she had this, uh, gymnastics competition, And she-she fell And she smashed up her foot, But... She wouldn't quit. Turned out she had broken a toe. But she had to finish. Even back then, she was- she was so stubborn. She's just... So cute and stubborn and just... Determined... So little. Sam. Okay. Oh. Sam. Hmm? This is a bad idea. Why? You're drunk. I'm not that drunk. Okay. Maybe we kiss when we're upset As, like, a comfort thing, a safe kissing place. Yeah, okay. We're lonely... Lonely neighbors. Yes. No. No, that kiss was not neighborly. That kiss was... Hot. Very hot. Okay. Do you... Want to keep kissing... See where it goes? Do you? Oh, no, no, no. Wait. I'm having déjà vu. No, I can't do this here in my office, again. No, no. This ia bad idea. Why? Because I-I just think- we're not thinking about... Naomi. I- I don't care about naomi. I'm over naomi. I know, sam. But you're my best friend's ex-husband. I don't care. Ahem. Do you know where sam- oh, there you are. Hey. You found me. I talked to naomi. I got her to reconsider. She's in there with violet. So if you're free, I think we should strike while the iron is hot. Okay? Am I gonna be okay? Well, this is really helping. Good. 'cause... I don't want to die. I know. Her fever's down, And she's stabilized for the time being. Maybe renee was right. I said it out loud and- You did not will this to happen. But I chose. God's punishing me. And niki- Niki is fighting, and she's a strong girl. But, um...This does chang. I think I could get her into remission, But we'll need to use the cord blood to really give her a shot. But the longer we wait, This could happen to kelli, too. And then we'd be right back here. I know. No. We need to do this. Do the transfusion on kelli. Okay, I can't do that Without getting permission from both of you. Then I'll get a court order. I'm not gonna let kelli die Because her mother can't make a choice. Celebrating our daughter's marriage With a bunch of prep school kids... Having dink and maya move into your house And have sex in your guest room Because they're married, Watching you walk our 15-year-old daughter Down the aisle to marry some boy named dink... I mean, do we-do we even know what his real name is, sam, This-this boy-this boy that wants to marry your daughter? I'm not saying that I support it. I just-I... I just think that the, uh, the baby should have a father. Y- your mother is a great woman. I know, and she worked two jobs And she's overprotective, and I love her for it. But maybe it would've been better If my father werehave been there. I think sam's just pointing out That two parents could be better than one. Naomi... I- I think that sam just wants you to think about What the alternatives are. I don't like it, nai. They say that they're m.F.E.O. M- m.F.E.O.? Oh, god. Made for each other. And, no, they are not, sam. They are not. Look, I know you want to talk about this more, But I just can't. I can't. I'm sorry. I wish I could, but I can't. Okay. Well... Dink's mother is coming back this afternoon. If you can't, you can't. But I'm gonna have to make some decisions For the both of us. There's no way! I won't let this happen. No, you'll just watch both girls die! Okay. All right. Stop! Stop. This is awful. I know it is, whoa, whoa. But you need to take care of this for them. We should let niki die? No, you should let one of them live. You should give the cord blood to niki because she's weak And she needs it. You should give it to kelli So you don't lose her, too. I don't know. I don't know which one's best, which you can live with. I can't choose between one child and another. You already have. You had a baby yesterday. You haven't even looked at him. I want to love him. I just... I feel like he's gonna replace them. I can't face that. no one wants to face this. But we have to. Uh, can you come with me to the exam room? You need a consult? No. Maya's there. Maya, are you okay? Dell said you were okay. Yeah, I'm fine. I just... Show him. Yep. Okay. Um... Here's the heart. It's beating strong. And the head. It's pretty cool, huh? what are you doing? Uh... Trying not to eat the chocolate. How's that going for you? Not good, but if I eat it, I'm gonna have to run for 5 miles On the treadmill tonight, And I don't, uh, I don't think I have 5 miles in me. It's just one chocolate. No, it's the gateway chocolate. I eat one, I eat them all. It's just food, nai. It's not a solution. But it's what I can do. Everything else, um... It's like I'm 13. Yeah, I know that I am a calm, rational person With many graduate degrees. I run my own business, And I am a strong, smart adult. And, uh, yet, I have a 15-year-old daughter Who was supposed to have a life. And, uh... The only way I can cope with that is this. Which is what I did when I was 13. It was always just me and the chocolate, Me and the food. And, uh, I know it's ridiculous, and... I know that I am burying my head in the sand, But it's... What I can do. I can do this. I can do this chocolate. I can, um... I'm in charge of this chocolate And my battle with food. This I can do. I can't do maya and babies and marriage. I know you can't. But you... Pulling out, You're leaving sam to figure this out on his own. And I'm there, and I'm trying to help, But... I'm not... Even sure how you feel about that. Feel about what? Me and sam... Having these conversations. I mean, it's just a little weird, you know. I mean, we live next door to each other, we sit and talk, And, uh... I don't know. It's... It's like- it's-it's like... Sam d I are the couple. Oh, that's funny, right? What, you and sam? Yeah, it's funny. Yeah. thank you for that, For making me laugh. I needed that. Oh, my god. You and sam. Oh, god. That is just wrong on so many levels. Oh! It's like, first you sleep with your husband's best friend And then you sleep with your best friend's husband. oh, my god. You-you-you would be the worst person ever. You would need these chocolates.</i> yeah. Nuh. Uh-huh. Mm. I can't do this. I can't break their hearts. You do it. T me? Are mom and dad still fighting? No, no. No. Is something wrong with trevor? No. He's fine. Trevor's fine. But here's the thing- We were all hoping threvor's blood Was gonna help you both get better. We're not going to get better? Well, niki is too sick to have the treatment right now. Well, I'm feeling better, though. I know, and that's good. But your body's too weak for the blood to help you. And so we need to give it to kelli. How long till I get it? Well, that's the thing, sweetie. There just isn't enough for both of you. I can share so we can both get it. I know. I wish that was the way that it works. But it doesn't. But... If we both don't get it... I don't want it. I don't want it. We do everything together, everything the same. But you have to get better. It's lucky. So you'll get better. Okay? Naomi. Mom... You came. Yeah, I came. I'm... So glad to finally meet you. I'm, uh, sorry that I was late. Well, I'm-I'm here. boy, I- I know that this Has been hard on all of us. They've put us in a difficult situation. I know that we all feel a little... Scared. But we are all in the same position, so- Excuse me. No, we are- we are not, Uh, in the same position. Your son can walk away, and, uh, My daughter is stuck with this in her belly for nine months. I think that you're missing the point here. My son is not walking away. You're missing my point. He could. Mom- mrs. Bennett, I... Dr. Bennett, ma'am... I don't want to walk away. I appreciate that. I do. But, um, this idea... This marrie... I said I would... Sign the consent. We all... All of us had a really good talk. You weren't here, so... We decided. Mom... I want you to understand. I want you to support all of this. I guess that's not for me to say. His name is fillmore. Dink-it's just... Just a nickname... Ma'am. Jerry. Hey. Um... Niki needs you. Daddy. I am so sorry, baby. Come here. I wanted niki to spend some time with her brother. I tried. I tried to engage, but... I was too late. And now I... Y- you know, I used to- I used to think of myself as a good person. You know, I was-I was a good friend, a good mother And a good ex-wife. But something happened, and now I... You know, I didn't get it. What you went through with lucas and walking away, I didn't get it. And I know maya's not like that, but I get it now. I do. I'm sorry. You don't get it. You don't... I didn't walk away from my child Because I couldn't deal with him Or because I wanted to control what he did. For me, walking away was The... Most awful thing in my life. But I-I made a choice... Because I thought it was in my child's best interest. I was just... Too damaged to do anything but hurt lucas. So I walked away... Not to avoid him or to... control him, But to save him. But, nai, you just... you didn't get your way. So you wanto walk away To avoid figuring out what comes next. I didn't get my way. You didn't get your way. I didn't get my way. So what do I do now? I don't know. if I had the answer on how to be a mother, I'd be doing it myself. If I tell you something, you can't tell anyone else. You're my shrink. Those are the rules, right? Actually, I'm not your therapist Or your psychiatrist. As I recall, we talked once, just briefly. Are you gonna tell anyone or not? Well, unless you killed someone, I... If I can help, I'll help. I do have an office. I like someone... A lot. And my dating life in l.A. Has been a little... Crazy. It's been awful and hard. And suddenly I meet someone who's easy, And it's not hard work. And there's not that awkward dance Of "getting to know you." It's like... It's like picking up on the 60th date. It's like what I've been looking for Has been right in front of me the whole time. Well, it sounds... Perfect. It could be. But... Seeing him... Would hurt a friend. You care about this friend? She's my closest friend. Ah. Yes, well... that could be a problem. That's not a helpful response. When someone like you poses a problem like this, I- I think you know what you want And that you want it, And you're looking for me to tell you that it's all right To do what you want. And is it? I think friendship is important. And lord knows, this friend, this woman you're talking about, I don't want to see her Be put through anything else right now. But... If this is really it, right, The one... I don't know that I could walk away. You want to live here, you want to be friends with violet- That is your business, And I will not make it about me. Well... Big of you. she's not home. So I just signed a piece of paper Allowing my daughter to get married. Congratulations Or I'm sorry. Which do you want? Okay, I... I want to pour these two glasses of wine, And then take you upstairs to my bedroom, Take off all of your clothes... And I want to stop talking about what we both... Want to do. That was bold. That-that was a whole lot of boldness... Going on there. I'm-I'm freaked out, too. I am. But... I mean, we can either Talk and talk and talk and talk about it Or we can stop talking And just... Be sam and addison and... See how it goes. Sam... You and naomi- All right, wait. Look... Not me and naomi. Me and you. Me and naomi- Stop staying that. Naomi is gone! She walked out... On me. She walked out on her daughter. Walked out. So I have no allegiance to naomi. When I wanted to give it another try, She walked out, and it killed me. Until now. Now I don't care about naomi. Now... Now I want you. Naomi di't walk out on me. She's my best friend. I can't... Look, I'm a cheater. It's what I do. Ah, don't- Or what I did. I want it to be what I did, past tense. Sam, I know that you and I don't have vows or rules. Still, sleeping with my best friend's ex-husband- It's cheating. I'm sorry, but it is. And I can't do that to naomi. And more importantly, I can't do that to myself. Not anymore. I'm trying to be a better person. Why can't just- just once... Why can't I get what I want... What you want? Sam- you-you- you don't want this? Your heart doesn't want this? I can't sten to my heart... Just- not this time. Sam, sam. Sam. Please. I'm sorry. Okay, please. I'm sorry.
