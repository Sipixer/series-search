No. I was under the impression that you'd broken up. We have. We were doing just fine hating each other Till maya's wedding. He followed me into the bathroom. Long story. Well, maybe after the long story, Cooper's just trying to figure things out. Maybe he's just an ass. So... This is the guy. I'm the guy. You know, I'd given up on meeting someone. That's why we harvested my eggs, but then... bam. Like a lilac bulb Bursting through the winter snow-- Outta nowhere. henry sells rare peruvian lily seedlings online. That's how we met. I googled all around, but he was the only one That would ship them overnight. Not many people understand the differences in lilies. Not the way may does. It's fate. We're like henry and June. But one month off. Don't make me laugh. It hurts when I laugh. Okay, what hurts? He flew all the way over here to meet me, So we could see if we both lived up To the e-mails and the pictures and the phone calls. And we did. You did,enry. I thought I was being gentle, but-- last night was our first time. Mm-hmm. I have never had so much pain. I feel like I'm... On fire. Okay. All right. Okay. Well, we will--we will take a look.

I think I'm gonna need a consult. You needed a consult and you called pete? He did... Call me. All right, people, I'm good. All right? I don't think this is. Right there. What's going on? This is dr. Wilder. He's a specialist in infectious diseases. I'd like you both to put these on, please. Elisha, if you could just come over to this side of the room, Just for a moment. You're scaring me. What's wrong? Esau has tuberculosis. What? No, no, no. Other than the cough, I-I feel fine. I feel fine. T.B. Doesn't always manifest with anything more than a cough. But it's serious. No one gets t.B. Anymore. Not here much, but it's on the rise In other parts of the world. What--what about elisha and the baby? What if they get it? We can test her. If she's positive, we can go ahead and treat her. The mask should protect her, But in the meantime, I'd like sam To check you into st. Ambrose, run some tests, Find out what strain you have And get you started on antibiotics. Wait, I--if immigration finds out I have t.B., What about my green card? I need you to sign off on my physical, to say I'm okay. Esau... No, his visa's expired. If you don't send that form in, they'll send him away. Dr. Bennett, please. Okay. So the nurses are finishing up on him. Uh, then you can go in. I put him on antibiotics And took some cultures to verify the strain. And what about the form, dr. Bennett? I have a legal obligation to turn that form in, And I-I can't lie on it. But he's gonna get deported. We're supposed to be married. I'm gonna have his baby in a few weeks. Can you hold off on sending the form in? I don't feel comfortable Withholding information from the government. If he doesn't have that form, he illegal and he can't work And he could be deported at any time. I... Okay, okay, um... W-we'll just go live with his--his parents in kenya. Elisha, uh... You can't leave the country. If he's going, I'm going with him. He's talking about the baby. He needs surgeries And extensive care for the next few years. You won't have access to the care that he needs in kenya. I'll hold off on--on sending in the forms. We'll get him treated And we'll worry about immigration later. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay.

Well, maybe eventually love. No, he's wooing me. Well, I gotta hand it to the guy. He's got class. And it's good to see you looking so happy. You and addison... I didn't think anybody knew about that. Yeah, well, addison told me. What about you and violet? Violet's on vacation. Well, don't you think that could be good for violet, Getting away from it all? She's spent the last nine months away from it all. What is it? (naomi) the tests from your exam Show that you had an allergic reaction. And that's why I brought in dr. Wilder. So what's she allergic to? She's allergic to your sperm. My sperm? Yes, it's a rare reaction to a protein in the fluid. Which can lead to an anaphylactic reaction The next time she's exposed. It's sort of like a peanut allergy. Once you have it, e next time's usually worse. But you can fix it, right? Well.. this type of allergy is complicated. I'm looking into possible treatments, But right now... No, I can't. we can't be allergic to each other. A-and what about kids? We both want to have kids someday. And if I'm allergic to his sperm-- that's--that's where we can help. We can wash the sperm and inseminate. And if that doesn't solve the problem, Then we can do in vitro with your eggs. So, uh, a baby someday. But--but we can't be, um... Intimate? Y-yes, you can be, just safely. You need to make sure you use a condom Until dr. Wilder can figure this out. I just wanted everything to be perfect. Thank you. Buenos dias! Well, look who forgot the s.P.F. this is for you. costa rica-- best coffee in the world. I thought you were touching monkeys. That was the plan, And then we went to the airport, And we said, "no plans-- costa rica." White sand beaches, fabulous music, A steady stream of alcohol... It was very zen.

Oh, thank you. uh, I'll meet you after. Your place? Okay. I'm so sorry. From your trip? Yeah. Hey, look at this. Banana fiber. Can u believe that? Someone could take a banana and make that. Costa rica. I was wondering if you had a number for violet. One of her patients--I need to get her on a plane. I mean, violet's patient, not violet. No, sorry. She's trekking in the rain forest, Next couple of weeks. Cooper, is she--I mean, is this good or is she running away? No, no, no. It's good. It's therapeutic. Well, I'm all for therapeutic-- And you covering her patients has been very helpful. She doesn't have to worry about them. She knows they're-- well, great, great. No pressure there. Sorry. It's just, uh, as I said, There's one I'm struggling with. Well, day after day, The sun... You know? It's zen. Oh, I found zen... Once. It was the best couple hours of my life. How long does he have to be in quarantine? Up to six months. We can't risk an outbreak. They're gonna be devastated. Always fun to break people's hearts. He's gone. They're gone. So I'm just gonna drive up tomorrow. I don't need to fly. I can have a good life without ever leaving the ground. You wanted this, natasha. What's the point? We've been over the crash a hundred times. Then let's not talk about the crash. Let's talk about yesterday. Okay? Talk me through it. We'll see if we can figure out what triggered you. Okay? okay. We sat down. And... Then the announcement came on, Talking about the emergency procedures. And I was still okay. Then what happened? I mean, what started you feeling anxious? I don't know. I just freaked out. Think about what you were thinking before that happened. You know, u talked about your sister and the wedding... Natasha? What happened? It was you. You touched my arm and told me to breathe Just like she did. Like violet? No, the woman who sat next to me in the crash. The woman I killed. Any luck in finding them? I've called everyone in elisha's file. No one's heard from them-- the grad school, nothing. And esau has no family here, so. They could be anywhere, incting anyone. We should've talked to elisha more after we told her She couldn't take her baby out of the country. You're saying I scared her? No, that's not what I said, sam. All right. Well, I'm calling immigration. No, sam. That is not our job. We're not the police. Leaving isolation at the hospital Was irresponsible. They're not going to knowingly put anyone at risk. Let me try and find them, okay? Now you're being irresponsible. Oh, really? I'm being irresponsible?</i> What is that supposed to mean? Oh, this is about vanessa. She works on babies, sam. You're dating someone you think will get to me. All right, you're jealous. And you know what? You don't get to be jealous because you made your choice. Sam, don'tall, okay? Look, they're scared. They're in trouble. The last thing they need is immigration coming down on them. I looked out and... I saw the wing hit the ground. And there was... There was smoke... And then fire... And screaming. I unbuckled my seat belt. But the woman xt to me, she... She couldn't get her belt undone. And... She was screaming, "help me. Please help me." But I just wanted to get out. I was so scared. And I looked at her, and she was scared. But I ran. I could hear her screaming, and... And I just ran away. You didn't kill her. The crash did. If you had stayed, you would've died, too. I could've done more. I waawful. I killed that woman. I can't talk my way out of that. I can't breathe my way past it. Natasha-- No. Tell violet I'm done with therapy. I quit. I'm only saying, We can block the formation of cicatricial tissue-- The neurons are spared permanent damage, And people like me would be able to walk No matter how bad the injury they sustained? I read last month's "new England journal," too. I'll leave you to it. Fife. I don't like being patronized. Even by our patron? What do you have against him? Hey! What? William white doesn't know you. He just likes the idea of you. You'd be like a trophy in his case. That's what you'd do for him. But since I read once, When you're fighting for a girl you love, You shouldn't put down the competition Because it makes you look insecure, I'll bring it back to me. Um... I know I'm abrasive. I know I'm snide. But. You make me a better person. That's what you do... For me. You gonna eat it or make love to it? Bananas are amazing. I will never look at one the same way again. Here. You can have this one. I'll find another. Ooh! What's your problem? (lowered voice) cut the zen crap, cooper. You follow me into the bathroom and then take off for two weeks. I know. It was a mistake, which is why I left. But I'm not angry anymore. Well, I am. The sex didn't have to mean we were a happy couple again, But it had to mean something. It did. It meant I was still angry. I've been sitting on a beach with a therapist Working this out. That moment has passed. We can move on with our lives. I forgive you. You forgive me? Yes. Ow! Ow! You need to talk to somebody About your eating disorder. Shut up. Fife's in love with me. Really? You're sure? Yeah, because he told me so. He said I make him a better person. Damn it. Yeah. Jeez. How do you turn down the guy in the wheelchair? What? Oh, god. I don't-- I don't even nice the wheelchair anymore. I mean, but--but who... Who does he think he is? How does get off loving me? I mean, he is mean. He is mean and he is sarcastic and he's morally adrift. He'd steal my d.N.A. And clone me If he could get away with it. He--he is everything that I hate. No, he's not--he's not allowed to--he's not allowed to love me. What? You like him. No. I am dating william. You like him a lot. Oh, my god. I like him a lot. Yes. Uh, she can't breathe. She--she thr up, and, uh, she started sweating. Slow down. Tell me what happened. Uh, we used a condom. I don't know. We thought we were being safe. She almost stopped breathing in the ambulance. epi's on board, But her pulse ox is dropping. I'm gonna intubate. I can't believe... Don't talk. I need to listen. Prep the tube, But give me one minute. She may not have a minute. May, I know you're scared... Dr. Wilder! But it's making your breathing worse. I need you to take slow, deep breaths. Henry, come take her hand. Slow, deep breaths. Feel the air fill your lungs. Good. good. Just like that. Good. Her airways are opening up. what happened? How could this happen after we took every precaution? I don't know. I don't know. Hi. Well, I don't know if the condom broke or leaked. It could've been too big. People have a tendency to buy 'em a little big. Anyway, there was seminal fluid present. It's not your fault, henry. But it is. You're allergic to me. We got unlucky. It broke. How often does that happen? We'll be fine. I-I can't have sex knowing that every time, Something could go wrong and I could kill you. Henry-- I love you. I never thought I'd find somebody who gets me. I don't want to be alone, but the thought of hurting you-- Guys, guys, let me find something. The last thing I want is for you to... Forgo sex. I will find a way. Okay? I haven't been stood up since... Oh, that's right. Ever. I'd like to thk you for letting me experience That unique humiliation That I had somehow managed to escape... Until now. I was supposed to meet you back at your place. You're just remembering this? Vanessa, I'm so sorry. I had a patient, and--and he'd left the hospital. I'm so sorry I like you, sam. I could really see myself with you. And a few years ago, I'd have ignored this voice in my head That says you're not where I am. I'd try and make you feel what I'm feeling. I-I feel... I like you. Addison montgomery. My entire professional life, I have been riding in the shadows of the reputation Of the famous double board certified redhead. I am not gonna do it in my personal life, too. Ad-addison and me-- I don't want to know. I'm a catch, sam-- An honest-to-god catch. But you're gonna have chase me to catch me. Vanessa-- Esau, are you all right? It's elisha. She's in labor. Okay, let's notify the o.B. And get her upstairs on a monitor. You're doing great, elisha. We were on our way to her mom's Because I was scared about immigration, But then the contractions started. Come on, we should get you back to isolation. No, no. I need to be with her. It's not safe for either of them. Come. Come with me. Esau. You gonna pull your hair out? No, no. Yeah, well... Maybe. I'm not sure bald's the right look for you. I'm just having a bad run. You, too? Cooper's back. He's all zen. It bothers you? I beat him with a banana. You gonna shrink me and tell me why? He's past the anger. You're afraid it means he's really over you. You're pretty good at this stuff. no, I'm failing everybody. I try to help people, and they run. Violet ran. Hepatient ran. Two means you're failing everybody? Don't shrinks tell people To avoid global statements like that? Yeah, well, it feels like everybody. Do you know how hard I tried to help violet? Maybe you didn't push too hard. You didn't push hard enough. I can't force a patient to continue therapy. You can let her know quitting's for losers. Nudge her in the right direction. You can show her settling is a coward's way out. Or you can sit here and pull your hair out until you go bald. Thank you. Whatever. Pete... You don't have to find a cure. he broke up with me. I just wanted to let you know. I didn't want to waste your time. I'm so sorry, may. Here. I can't stop crying. Well, I know it's hard, Losing something you felt was right, But sex... Is important. And maybe it's better to end it now Before it got serious. I know I just met him, And that may not make sense to you, But... Oh, he was the one. I've spent my whole life waiting for someone like henry. and now he's gone. But... Oh, he still has my heart. And maybe he always will. You'll find someone else. Just give it time. Do you really believe that? I do. I'm sorry. Tell naomi to forget about the eggs, too. I can't do it on my own. After henry... I'm done. Elisha's labor is progressing quickly. But the baby-- everything looks good so far. I'll have a neonatal team standing by. I'll give you an update as soon as the baby's born, okay? Is that esau ajawke? Yes, it is. I'm agent jones with immigration and customs enforcement. I have an order here to detain mr. Ajawke. Addison. I told you not to call. Well, I did what I thought was right. How is tearing them apart right? She can't go to kenya. He can't stay here. What do you want me to say? Sometimes love doesn't always work out. No, sometimes it doesn't. Oh, come on now. I'm trying to move on here. I'm trying to be happy. Yeah, well, good for you. In the meantime, I have to deliver elisha's baby-- A baby that esau isn't even going to see. How are they supposed to move on? "on semen"? A little light reading? May almost died. Henry's condom broke or leaked. He left her. Oh, that's awful. They were perfect. It makes you wonder if there's some kind of message in it-- Biology telling them they don't belong together. Well... I mean, there are the people That are right for you on paper, And then there are the people that are just right. Is it settling If you go with the person who's right for you on paper? Maybe there's nothing wrong with settling... With being wooed. Sometimes the person who's just right... Doesn't want you. Or they do, and they are just... Wrong. Yeah. Are we gonna have-- Have this discussion? No, no. No, okay. Oh. God, I really wanted may to get her guy. Me, too. I'm sorry. This isn't something I do. I value your privacy and your desion to not do therapy. Dr. Wallace-- no, I just have something to say, And then I'll leave, And you can do whatever feels right for you. I wanted to be a surgeon. Look, I d--I don't-- Medical school, stanford, 1986-- E.R. Rotation during my internship. My first night on call, there was a bus accident. The place was flooded with people, And I was assigned this guy whose leg was mangled, And--and he was in pain. He was yelling and screaming at me, and... I couldn't stop the bleeding. I called for help, and--and everyone was busy. And this guy, he--he started kicking and yelling at me. And I let go of the compression, And he bled out. And he kept yelling at me until he was dead. I faked illness for the rest of the week, And as soon as I could, I switched to psychiatry. See, I ran. My father was a surgeon. And that's all I ever wanted was to make him proud. I haven't been through a plane crash. But I know what it's like Not to push through what you want to do. And y-you saved yourself, natasha. That-that's not wrong. No, it--it's human. It is. And I don't want to push you to be scared. I want to push you past being scared So you can have what you want, so you can have the life You wanted to have before the crash. And I know I'm not violet, but I can help you. So just please... Let me help you. We'll be heading out soon. Mm-hmm. Copy that. The ambulance arrived. We're gonna be taking him now. Uh, I'm sorry. You can't. The nurses just paged me. His oxygen levels have dropped. It's probably due to the infection Or the fluid that's collecting in his lungs. Is that right? Look, if you take him now, You'll have a body on your hands by the time you get there. Thank you. Dr. Montgomery's delivering your baby. If you want to see him, put this mask on And start acting sicker. I think you're lying. Are you sure? Are you a doctor? You might want to step back. He's very contagious. Wouldn't want to put you at risk. We'll wait till he's stable. Henry. I asked henry to come because-- he can fix it, may. You--you can fix it? I can try to fix it. There are breakthroughs being made In desensiting people to this type of allergy. Uh, desensitizing, how? I would use injections of henry's seminal fluid. Mm-hmm. Expose you to small traces And build up your immune response over time. How much time? It could take six months, maybe a year. There's no guarantee this will work. Look, told you that it would be okay, But what you two have, you ci envy it.On. So maybe it's enough to survive for some time with no sex. He's beautiful. He's so beautiful. Thank you. Okay, I can't stall anymore. You gotta go now. I love you. And I love you. Do I think about you when I'm with her? Yeah. But I can't wait around for something I can'have. I won't. And you shouldn't expect me to. Sourdough. I've been to san francisco today... On a plane with the patient who was afraid to fly. She did great. So that's my way of saying, "thanks for kicking my butt into gear." congratulations. You did it. No. No, you did it. So take the thanks, take the sourdough And, uh, well, take this.
