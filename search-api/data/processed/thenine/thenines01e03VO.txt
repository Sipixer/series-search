We were all in the bank... Let's do this thing. - All for different reasons. And then... - Now. In an instant, our lives changed. - Who's in charge here ? - I am. Get into the vault. 52 hours later, we came out of there - no longer strangers... - I'm pregnant. Bonded forever by what we went through. - You haven't told him yet ? - No. Two years, and we just flush it down the drain with barely a conversation. There are two full days of my life that I don't remember. Somebody has got to pay for what happened. - I'm with you. - Get on with your life. Take your medal. Take your promotion. We understand that a 9-1-1 call came from with... inside the bank. - Egan's gonna be a hero ! - Hero ? Don't you ever just wanna let go... Take charge of this place, take charge of your life ? You're fired, Egan. What happened in there ? Only we know... for now. Hour 1 - 3:07 PM Everybody !  Come on ! That means you, too !  Now ! - Who's in charge here ? - I am. Just have to get my key... now ! Everybody else, down on the floor ! Go !  Go !  Go !  Go !  Go ! No talkin'. Okay, okay. It's all right. Damn it, move !

I'm right here. I said back off. Hey !  The doctor's used to being in charge. But we all know that you are the boss here. Yeah, you're damn right I am. Why aren't those people seeing us ? Tinted windows. All right, all right, I can't... I gotta get outta here. - I can't, I can't. I've gotta get up. - Just shut up. - I can't breathe. I... - Shut up, lady. Somebody turn her off ! It's a panic attack. Please, can I just talk to her for just one second ? - Mother, look at me. Mom. - All right. Does anybody have a paper bag ? We should get her a paper bag. No, shut up ! Mother !  Mother, please... Get down or I'll blow your brains out. Hey, come on, man. You're not making this any better. Yeah, I can see that ! You think I can't see that ? Please, please !

I'm gonna shoot her. Open it. All right, sweetheart. Fill the bag up. Fill it up. Come on, hurry up. Hurry up ! Everybody, quiet. This is bad. What's that you say, honey ? That's Mr. Lushtak. He comes every friday to deposit payroll. He doesn't understand that we're closed early for the long weekend. He will make a scene. I swear. All right. Angel face, you're gonna go over to that door, you're gonna open it, and you're gonna tell Mr. Lushbag to take his ass home. - No, I should do it. - No, I got it. I'm fine. No, she's only been working here six weeks. I have been here three years. Please. - Franny... - He knows me. Please. My gun is gonna be 4 inches from your head you twitch, I'm a pull the trigger. All right, we need to reconfigure here. You, you, over there. You, over there. Hey, pajama boy ! Move him over there. No. He could have a neck injury. "No" ? - You want me to move him, I gotta check him. - Just do it. - Yeah, and kill him or paralyze him ? - I'll do it. No. You're not moving this guy. This isn'tn E.R. You're way outta your depth here. He dies, it's on you. Keep opening your mouth, and we all die. That's on you. Ordinary day... everything is fine. Franny, what ?  It's 3:15. I'm sorry, Mr. Lushtak. We're closed early for the holiday weekend. What holiday is this ? Listen, why don't you come back on tuesday, okay ? I'll make deposit quick today. Not today. Tuesday. Is Mr. Jones here ? I'm sorry. We've already turned the computers off. I couldn't get the transaction done if I wanted to. You looking sick. You okay ? I'm fine. You're sweet. I'm...I'm fine. Why don't you come first thing next week ? Front of the line, okay ? That's right, Gorbachev, keep on walking. Down on the floor and no one gets hurt. - You get it ? - Yeah, it's done. 9-1-1. What's your emergency ? Hello ? What's your emergency ? The Bloc Team presents to you The Nine - Episode 3 - What's your emergency ? 13 days later. Can anyone identify this man ? It's okay. He's the bank manager. Daddy !  Daddy ! What is happening here ? Why didn't you wake me ? Felicia gone to school yet ? No, she had a hard time falling asleep. She wouldn't tell me why, and she still can't remember anything. - Malcolm Jones. - Hi. Good morning, sir. She's seeing the hypnotherapist today, and I am seriously thinking about calling a neurologist. Neuro... honey. Just let the child be. She'll remember when she's ready. If she's never ready, I'll be all right with that. Uh... Do you want panic buttons in all the bedrooms ? Yes. I'm a doctor. Just let me check him. I'm right here. You threw it all away for me. Ricky, please ! I need to get you to school ! No ! I'm gonna be late for my job interview. Please, honey, help me out here. Ricky ? What are you doing ? Ricky, in a minute I'm gonna break this door down !  Come on, Ricky !  Open up ! Detective Nick Cavanaugh... in the paper today. I saw. Yes, all pressed and powdered. I think I should've been invited to the ceremony, frankly. Mom, I'm gonna be late. - I don't know why I agreed to pick you up today. - Because it's on your way. I live downtown. I work downtown. How is picking you up in Westwood and dropping you off in Beverly Hills on the way ? Well, I just assumed you spent the night at Ed's. Well, I didn't. I had to work. You're very jumpy today. Well, it's my first day back in court, and I have a doctor appointment - smack in the middle of everything. - Doctor's appointment ? Nothing's wrong. It's for... I'm fine, okay ? I have a day. I'll handle it. Egan ?  Egan ! Oh !  Oh ! How long have you been up ? Oh, boy. Since 4:00, yeah. Me... up since 4:00. Yeah, I went for a jog, now I'm doing calisthenics. It's a gorgeous day, and you are a gorgeous wife. Did I have a nightmare, or did you tell me you got fired last night ? I did !  And it is the best damn thing to ever happen to us. - Whoa !  Honey, you're sweaty. - Go with it. Oh, come on, baby. We have got plenty of savings, huh ? And I just got off the phone with corporate, and since I got fired... - Oh ! - Whoo ! I get severance. Yeah, that's right. That little pissant Ryan's gotta pay me for six weeks. I've got sick days I didn't take... I've got vacation time we never cashed in, and I have an appointment with an employment agency this afternoon. I'm gonna go out there today, Mary, and I am gonna cast the net wide. Never seen nothin' like you social work's a joke. Will you get the doctor in here, please ? You're not doing all you have to do to stay on the transplant list, Celia. And I want to help you with that. You probably just want to move her off the list to bump up a patient that can pay better. That is simply not true. What is true is that there's no trace of prograf in Celia's blood, and that alone can disqualify her. Don't talk to me like I didn't go to school ! I went to school, all right ? What the hell's wrong with you ? I didn't do anything to you. Y-you saw. I didn't do anything. Sorry. Sorry. Hey, Nicko. Thanks for coming. What's goin' on ? Well, for starters, Randall Reese had a major heart attack last night. Is he dead ? No. They revived him. The doctor can't put his finger on what exactly caused it. Plus, cartoon cop over here entor a coffee break and left the room open for visitors. So you think somebody got to him ? I got an orderly saying he saw someone coming out of Reese's room a few minutes before all the machines started screaming. Hmm. Really ? - Hey, Kelli, what's happening ? - Randall Reese coded last night. - How is he ? - Touch and go. I don't know if they're investigating something or what. Listen, bud, I know how you feel about those people that you went through the thing with, but from what I've heard, that social worker friend of yours had been pretty messed up. You think Lizzie did this ? You're outta your mind. Apparently she was freaking out every time she got anywhere near the guy. And then last night, she was seen up here, hovering around and circling this floor. There's no way. I'm telling you, there's no way. All right, look, you were in there with her for two days. She got motive ? I got motive. Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure if it was you, you would've gotten the job done. I sent Reese's medical chart over to Mario, so hopefully I'll get some physical evidence. In the meantime, I would like to have a conversation with Ms. Miller. No. I don't want you harassing her on a lark. You get something in hand, we'll discuss it. You okay ? - You still haven't told Jeremy yet ? - No. Okay. This is just a routine visit. I don't know why I asked you to... No, it's... I wanted to be here. Alex, what's up ? Yes, I know that witness is coming in today. No, I don't want you to question her before I get there. Yeah. Yeah, and have Allison file the carson brief. Yeah. No, I refused cave in to that ridiculous mandatory joinder. Fine. S orry. Elizabeth Miller ? Would your partner like to come in with you ? - Oh. - Oh ! - No, I don't know if you want... - Maybe if you want to go alone... - Either way. - Okay, that's... that's fine. I asked you to page Dr. Kates. We have been waiting here for over an hour. What are you writing ? I told you. I need to ask your son what happened. Look, he's not my son. He's my nephew, and his mother just died. That's what happened. Can you give us a break ? Hey. What's... what's... what's goin' on ? It's Ricky. He...he actually locked himself in the bathroom, - and he hit his head on the tub or the sink. - Okay. Can you help him please ? Nobody will help him. They're much more interested in me. I know her, Julie. Everything's fine here. - Okay. - Thank you. - It's her job to suspect. Don't take it personally. - Yeah, no, I know. Hey, buddy. - Hi. - Hi. You mind if I take a quick look ? Let me see. Ok. Oh, that's not so bad at all. Nothin' a couple of stitches can't cure. You see ? Best doctor in the world. Oh, you must be really busy, huh ? Um... Yeah. You know what ?  I'm gonna get a plastic surgeon down here to take care of Ricky, okay ? - He'll be in better hands with Dr. Rai anyway. - Okay. I can't believe the thoughts I've been having. It's really... I haven't had an easy life. And... in my job, I see a lot of bad stuff... A lot of bad people, and I've always been fine. But now suddenly, I'm scared of things. And not even particular things... just a general fear. The world feels... violent and dangerous. And out of nowhere, something can just... How can you bring a child into that when you can't even... I mean... How can you do that ? You don't have to keep that baby, you know ? The doctor will be with you in a minute. Hey, detective. We got a woman, early 30s... Yeah, just, uh, give me one minute, okay ? How you doin', Mario ? Hey, Nicko. Glad to see you back. - Congratulations on that promotion. - Oh, yeah, thanks. Hey, uh, did you get a chance to look at that Randall Reese chart yet ? Uh, yeah, I took a gander. You send over the findings ? No, not yet. Kinda had my hands full with, you know, crime scenes and whatnot. No, it's fine. I was just hoping to catch you before it went back to Vartak. So, um... Anything in his file trip you ? Well, actually, yeah. Really ? Yeah, large amounts of potassium chloride in the blood stream... "KCL" as we call it. Enough to stop his heart, which is pretty smart, actually. Why is that ? Well, the substance occurs naturally in the system. There'd be no way to prove he was poisoned. Unless you have other evidence, that is. I want you to sit on this for a day. Hey... The guy's not dead. It's not murder yet. Just a day, for me. Yeah, okay. Sure, Nick. Just let me know what to do next. Mr. Dawson's B.P. is a little low, but his fever's down to 101, which is a real improvement. And he was able to swallow some water this morning. Do you want to do this later ? What ? No. I'm good. ...for the Washington case. She can use the template on my hard drive, but she'll need to update it with the gomez ruling in the ninth circuit, handed dowlast month. That's really helpful for us. Oh, um, she's not here. She's getting married in Santa Cruz. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah, she's, uh, been planning it for months. Was, uh, anyone from the office invited ? Um... I think Marty and Caroline went. Oh, oh, good. I'm glad. That's really nice for her. All right. Well, have Allison take care of the memo. And you know what ? Push the bail hearing in Kendall. That way we can nail down the Lorenzo witness. Egan foote, with an "E." Not at the beginning of the "Egan" but at the end of the "Foote." Yes, I know. I saw you on the morning show. You were the bomb. Oh !  Why, thank you. Take a look-see at this list of jobs, and they'll be ready for you in a jiff. Okeydoke. Thank you. Franny. Hey ! - Hi. - Hi. - Malcolm recommended this place to you, right ? - Malcolm send you here ?  Yeah. Yes, yes. Wait, I thought you had a job. I got fired. That's okay. Sit, sit. I, uh, I egged it on in retrospect, so, in essence, I quit. I meant to call you and thank you for that fund you set up for Ricky. Ah, it was nothing. It wasn't nothing. It was... - Well... let's see your prospects, huh ? - All righty. Okay, there is... a position in financial pricing optimization in Cerritos... Um, a sales operations job for some I.T. products in San Marino. Wow. The cubicle walls are closing in on me already. Is there, uh, something on there that's more, I don't know, creative ? Like what ? Like a think tank ? Or I could be a docent at a Civil War museum. Although I think that's generally a volunteer position, so... Yeah, I think you probably want something with a little bit of income, huh ? Francisca Rios. That's me. - Wish me luck. - You won't need it. Don't settle in there. - Okay. - Okay. Lizzie Miller here ? Nick. - Hey. - Hi. Isn't this Randall's room ? Yeah. He's down on four getting some tests. Apparently he's been touch and go all day. What are you doing here ? - I came here to face him. - Oh. Is this your first time up here ? God, no. I've been on this floor half a dozen times, circling like a hawk. The nursing staff must think I'm out of my mind. Were you here when Randall coded ? I just found out a few minutes ago. Yesterday I told Jeremy I wished Randall were dead. So how is Jeremy doing ? Well... He'd never say it, but I think he's having a harder time than I am. And he lost a patient yesterday. Is he here now ? Douglas Russell, FBI. Yeah, I remember you. - I should probably wait for my lawyer. - Oh, he's coming. He's probably stuck on the 5. You know how it is. Some of my easy-listening favorites. They make iPods now, you know ? Much more compact, easy to carry. Why are you here ? I've been thinking about it, - everything that happened in there, and... - Yeah, well, try not to think too much. Just get back to your life. Forget about me. - But I just... - Forget about me, Felicia. Why was Felicia Jones here ? You heard the tape. She wanted to say hi. A little Stockholm syndrome, maybe ? Good-lookin' guy puts a gun in a young girl's face, she's seduced by his power. Or maybe she knew you beforehand. You really think I planned a robbery with a 16-year-old girl ? I just want to know everything that happened. Let's try that again. I'm in the bathroom. I hear a man yelling. I open the door. I see my dad. He's walking by me. I'm so scared for him. I want to call out to him, but... I see Lucas holding a gun to his back. I close the door, grab my phone, dial 9-1-1. Right. And then what, Felicia ? It just stops there. It just stops there, my memory. My memory just stops there. Okay, I'm pulling you out, on three, two, one. I'm responsible. I'm responsible for the whole thing. I'm responsible for all those people. Jeremy, hey, it's Nick. I'm here at the hospital, and, uh... I just heard that you missed rounds this morning, uh... And nobody here can seem to find you. I really need to talk to you. It's important. Hello. Hi. It's... it's Jeremy calling. Hey there. I was just, um... I was calling to see how... How Ricky's doing. Oh, he's fine. I took him over to my grandma's. There's fewer sharp corners over there. Jeremy ? Are you all right ? This is nice. Dinner out. We never do this. We should do this more. - We're doing it now. - Uh-huh. Isn't it great ? So... the employment agency ? I want to... hold out for something better. There's something I really want, Mary. I want kids. Or... a kid. One would be great. - You know we can't, Egan. - But that's not true. - Yes, it is. - No, it's really not. We tried once... a long time ago. We had a hard time, we gave up. Look, I can't talk about this now. We got scared, and we crawled off into our separate corners, and we gave up. Now there are things that they can do to help us... with all of it. It's not too late. It's not too late. It doesn't even look real from up here. Well, there's the employment agency I went to today. It didn't go well ? I didn't finish college, which apparently qualifies me to the back entrance of a lot of our businesses. I don't type, I wouldn't take anything in a bank, I am computer acquainted, but not computer savvy, blah, blah, blah. He offered me a job lugging dirt. And I took it. I'm kidding. Come sit down. I don't know. I just don't know anymore. What ? I did things in there that I didn't see coming. It's okay. And I've done things since... I'm sorry... about Lizzie. I know I really screwed things up for you guys. No, that's not... That wasn't your fault. It's just that I needed you that day. And I didn't mean to do that. I needed you, too. What took you so long ? Traffic, honey. She's over two hours late. She's not answering her phone. Baby, there's nothing to worry about. She's just being a teenager, okay ? What have you heard from Maggie and Trish ? They haven't seen her, Malcolm, and neither has Jared. She didn't show up for her last two classes, and I'm waiting to hear back from the hypnotherapist. All right, all right, baby. It's all right now. It's gonna be fine. Don't worry. Don't worry. Hey, congratulations. I hear you got our witness to fold. Like a paper fan. So how'd you nail her ? Give me all the details. Rent some porn, Alex. Hello. N... I can't... I can't hear you. I've... I have bad reception. - You're what ? - All rise. Well, can't you go to your E.R. ? You're in your E.R. ? Lizzie, you're... you're breaking up. I'm sure that you'll be fine. Be seated. In the matter of the people vs. Rubin, defense has moved for a consideration of Mr. Rubin's sentence. Ms. Hale ? - Kathryn, you're up. - Yes. Ahem. Your honor, in determining the severity of the sentence, the court must consider if the factors in aggravation outweigh the factors in mitigation. I'm sorry. I have to go. Excuse me. Alex, take over. - When did the cramping start ? - Ten minutes ago. Move. Please move ! God ! Damn it. Go through, go through. - Stay still, Lizzie. - I need to get that. No cell phones in here, Lizzie. I don't care !  Give it to me. Oh, come on, Lizzie. Lizzie, pick up. Kathryn, are you there ? Lizzie, hi. Hi. Yeah, I'm... I'm here. - How... how are you ? - Scared. I don't think my baby's gonna be okay. And I want it to be okay. Okay. Okay. - Listen to me. - I'm listening. This baby is strong. It has a strong will. It survived the 52 hours, right ? It did. It survived that. And you went through a lot in there, - and it went through a lot n there, right ? - Yeah. So I'd say if this baby can survive that, it certainly can survive a normal day in your boring life. I see it. You... you see it ? It's there. Now we just need to find a fetal heartbeat. You see it ? Now they just have to find the heartbeat. They will. Where is it ? They'll find it. They're not finding it. Lizzie, they will find it. I hear it. You hear it ? I hear it. I hear it. Oh, my god. Kathryn, Kathryn, can you hear it ? C-can you hear it ? No, but I... I can imagine. Hi. Lizzie, you... you should hang up now. Lizzie... Yeah. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Yes, we did. We already spoke to the school. I think you should call your cop friend Nick. Please, honey, I-I will, as soon as I'm done with this. No, no, no. No, she hasn't called any of her friends. Could... Okay, if you hear anything, could you just please... Wait, hold on a second. This might be her. Hold on. Hello. Yes. O-okay. I'll... I'll be right there. What is it ? Felicia... broke into the bank. Where is she ?  Is she all right ? She's okay. Apparently, she found your spare keys, came in through the door and tripped the alarm. The guys found her just sitting in the bathroom... with her phone out. I'm so sorry to have to involve you in this. I really I am. It's okay. Let's go. What is the matter with you, scaring us like this ? How could you do this to us ? - How could you do this to your mother ? - I'm sorry. With everything that we've been through, why would you... I don't understand you. Why would you do this ? I don't know. What were you doing there in the bathroom, just by yourself ? I don't know !  I don't know ! Well, who would know, Felicia, if you don't ? Maybe you would, dad ! What are you talking about ? Look, I know that I made the 9-1-1 call. How could you not tell me that ? Why does that matter ? It matters because it means everything. It was all my fault. It was supposed to be five minutes, but then the cops came. Baby... it's not your fault. Yeah, well, I don't believe you, dad. Why would I lie to you ? Because that's all you've been doing ever since we got out of there. All I... Felicia, all I have been doing since we got outta there is try to help you get on. I'm trying to protect you. Protect me from what ?  ! I don't even know what you're trying to protect me from. Don't you understand that that's the scariest thing ? At do you want from me ? What do you want from me ? I want you to help me. Help me remember. Oh, for god's sake, I've already told you ! Two robbers came into the bank. It went wrong, okay ? We were trapped for two days. - Oh, okay. - You were scared. "Trapped for two days. Trapped for two days." I was scared. Is that all I'm ever gonna get from you ? Felicia, this is why you did this ? This is why you came down here, to provoke me ? To what, Felicia ? To provoke me to what ? What would you have me do ? What would you have me do... Walk you through every terrifying step of every moment we had in there ? I can't do that. I'm... Baby, I'm your father. I'm your father. Gotta get through the next few hours. You want some ? No. - Do you have a second ? - Sure. I had a thing today. I'm okay. Everything's... great. But, um... I'm pregnant. Is this what you wanted to tell me before the bank ? Yes. - And you're telling me now. - Yes. - This is a lot. - I know. It's just... It's a lot. I wish you had told me sooner. It's very shrill. It like a shriek, and then it goes... From being a shriek to being a bray. She shrieks and she brays. It's... Yeah, you... you have to be there for... for that to... You're... kind of quiet this evening. Oh, sorry. Sorry, I was... How did the returns go ? I have a credit at Tiffany's that I will never use. Darling, did you lose in court today ? No, I won... a very important motion this morning, and a very important witness for a very important case. You see ? And you were worried you couldn't handle your day. When, um... When I was 27 years old, mom, and I was on this path, I... I, um, I... I found out I was pregnant. And... I didn't tell anyone 'cause I could handle it. I went to work. I... excused myself for an afternoon procedure, and then I had a cab take me back to the office, and I went back to work. I rested for a couple of hours, and then... I won my first really big case. It was a really big day for me. Why are you telling me this now ? I think we got a problem. What's that ? Someone was seen coming out of Randall's room right before he coded. You're kidding. No, I'm not. And his blood work showed choice amounts of "KCL"... Pretty smart, pretty untraceable. So you're convinced somebody tried to kill him ? Someone with knowledge... access. One of my detectives thinks it was Lizzie. What ? Why ? She was seen up there many times that night. It wasn't Lizzie. I just want him out of my I.C.U., Nick. Lizzie's pregnant. She's pregnant. Just found out. I'm supposed to be a cop. I'm supposed to be a doctor. If he dies, I can't bury this. Honey, I'd like you to come with me into the living room. I invited some people over to see you. Will you come ? Okay, now I'll tell you this, but, uh, it's only gonna be what I've heard, since I wasn't there with you at the time. You were in the bathroom, and, um, you must have heard what was going on. But, uh, instead of staying there, you so valiantly came out into the bank. You so heroically came out to try to call for help. Well, and... and then, Eva and I saw you hiding underneath Malcolm's desk, and we both thought, oh, no. I mean, we did not want you to have to be there. And I guess it was at that point that we really didn't know - what you were trying to do with the phone. - I-I did. But I didn't have the courage to take it. I-I was trying to calm my mother. I-I was thinking, isn't this just perfect ? My mother's anxiety is actually gonna get us all killed. I don't know what I was doing. You were trying to help Tom. You were trying to save his life. I wanted to keep you safe. You tried to run the phone to me, but I wouldn't let you do that. But... I didn't tell you not to make the call. I was really scared, and you were right there with a lifeline. And we found our way to each other. See, you had done all the hard work. You just needed someone to push that last button. Transcript Made By Raceman
