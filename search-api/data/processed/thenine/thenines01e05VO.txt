- We were all in the bank... - Let's do this thing. All for different reasons. - And then... - Now. In an instant, our lives changed. This will all be over in five minutes. 52 hours later, we came out of there no longer strangers, - bonded forever by what we went through. - Two people are dead. One of them was shot with my gun. There was nothing that you could have done about Eva. - What are you doing here? - It occurred to me that maybe you could use some company. - Randall needs a new liver. - So what do we want to do? We have to try. For Eva. I mean, he should have to answer for her. Tell me what we need to do to convince Randall. There's only one thing that will change his mind. What is that? Me. I'm gonna give you a piece of my liver. You and me, brother. I need to talk to you about Carlos, Eva's ex. He keeps calling me saying that he needs money and threatening to take custody of Ricky if I don't pay him. Eva's ex did some time at Corcoran. - Randall reese was at Corcoran. - What happened in there? Eva had absolutely nothing to do with this. We can still get out. No chance. They got it covered. We'll go out the back way. Take one of the cars in the parking lot. He's right. Hour 1 - 3:19 PM All the firepower's at the front door. They probably don't even know there is a back way. We need car keys now! Take mine. It's the blue 4-door - right outside on your left as you go out. - Come on! And let these people just walk away? Not a chance. You go ahead. The way's clear, you call me. I'll come running with the money. That man's really hurt. Now is it all right if the doctor and I go out there and help him? We won't cause any trouble. I promise. Please. Okay, okay. Okay. One goes, everybody goes. On your feet. Come on! Let's go! On your feet! Back out front. - Oh, I wish somebody would make up their mind. - Mother, please. Let's go! Easy, easy, easy, easy. Don't do anything. I need something to raise his head with. Here. Here, take that. Easy. Hey, listen. There was another girl here. It was my daughter. Yeah, I saw her. I don't know where she went. No go. The phone keeps on ringing. - Must be the cops. - You gotta pick up. You don't, they're gonna assume the worst. They'll come right in. You... come here. I'll talk to 'em. No. She's gonna talk. I'll be listening. Look at me before you say anything. Got it? Pick up. Hello. This is lieutenant Dan O'Neill with the L.A.P.D. Who am I talking to? Eva Rios. I'm a teller at the bank. Okay, Eva. Is anybody hurt in there? No. How many robbers are in the bank? Four. - There's something going down on this plaza. - You're doing great. How many hostages? - Uh, I think about ten. - I see cops. They're getting ready to come in. - Good. Okay. - Three, four, five on the move. - Hang up now. - My son is Ricky Rios. He's at blessed heart academy. - Hey, he said hang up! - Please get him to my grandmother's. We're goin' outside. Come on. I'll go. She'll be too nervous. You need someone who'll stay calm. Back off. It'll  be okay. I'm gonna count to five! Everybody hasn't started backing up, I'm gonna start shooting. One... two... three... Eva! 4 weeks later. I thought you were delaying Lucas and Randall's preliminary - hearing till after they got out of the hospital. - Turns out we can't. The defense didn't agree to the motion, so we have to hold the hearing by thursday to make the 10-day deadline. - I can't believe they'll be well enough to appear in court. - They're not. We're holding the hearing in the hospital day after tomorrow. - That'll be a circus. - I think that's the idea. I'm bringing in all your friends for a meeting this afternoon. I'll need you to be there as a witness, okay? Not a D.A. or someone who thanks me in private, as much as I like that. Sure. Anything else show up linking Randall and Carlos Vega other than their prison time? No, because we haven't been looking for a connection. You said there was no way Eva Rios was involved. - I was just wondering. - Okay, wait, wait, wait. Are you saying they could've been involved? 'Cause we're preparing a case that says Lucas and Randall worked on their own. Now if that's wrong, I need to know right now. It's not. I'm just curious. Okay. It's a schoolboy's fantasy, completely childish, but... it's something I've always wanted to do. You've wanted to go horseback riding your entire life, - and you've never done it? - Nope. Any interest in joining me? Most places, they keep the horses to a walk. I found -  a stable in topanga canyon that let's 'em run. - Sorry. The only running I do is from my ex. I guess those feelings never really dissipate, do they? Well, there's that, - plus the ongoing issue of spousal support. - Oh, yes. Uh, about that... Uh, money, I mean. -  I don't want you to think that I expect to freeload. - Forget it. - No, no, no. Some form of rent's only appropriate. - You're my guest. End of discussion. All right, if you insist. I'm off. Ride 'em, cowboy. 3:00 in the morning is not a time to be coming back home from work. It's time to be in bed. It's the job I can get, grandma, and it's good money. Ricky, hurry up, or we're gonna be late. Why does his teacher want to see you for anyway? He's getting in trouble... Bad grades, fights. How'd he do last night? Like always. He... He cried. He asked for Eva. Do you think he's getting worse? He sure is not getting better. Uh, you know, you don't have to come in here to do this. You could use the A.T.M. outside. Oh. Yeah. It's perfectly safe. I mean, there's cameras watching the whole time. I prefer eyes that look back at me. I heard that about you. Mary. Good to see you. Malcolm. I bring you greetings from the corporate mother ship. - Things good up there? - Last I heard, we were making money, so yes. How's it here? Um, back to normal, more or less. Listen, the real reason I'm here is that we have a problem. It's about the guard who was killed during the robbery... Tom Mitchell. What's wrong? His widow's initiated a wrongful death action against us. Judith is suing the bank? The bank and you. Me? Why? They're claiming negligence. You were his direct supervisor, so you're responsible... in theory. Malcolm, what the hell happened? You don't have to worry about any legal fees or potential liability. You're indemnified by the bank, so everything's covered. - Have you offered her a settlement? - A very generous one, and the counteroffer was simply unreasonable. Well, there must be a way to work this out. I'm afraid it's an adversarial process, Malcolm, and, um, she started it. Hey, bro. How you feelin', Randall? Like hell. What do you think? This is Carleton Fry. He's gonna be your attorney at the hearing and at trial if that's your choice. Wait a minute. I thought you were gonna be my lawyer. We'll be mounting separate defenses. It wouldn't be - ethical for me to represent you and Lucas. - Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reese. I've already done some research and come up with some very interesting material. Separate defenses? What does that mean? We're not here to discuss trial strategy. I thought... We were in this thing... together. Not anymore. So if we could just go over the terms of the preliminary hearing. So what's the story... I'm the big, bad wolf, - 'caused all the trouble? - Yes. Something like that. What was this for? I was ready to check out for good, and you said no. For what? To screw me over? Have somebody to blame it all on? It's complicated. Oh. Oh, I bet. I want to talk to my lawyer alone. Of course. You brought me back to life. Don't think you ain't gonna pay for that. The Bloc Team presents to you The Nine - Episode 4 - All About Eva One... two... three... Eva! What the hell is going on? Who did that? It was an accident. We are not shooting. You hear me? We are not shooting. Hey there. Hi. Hi. Sorry if I woke you. You didn't. I was just resting. We're the first ones here? Yeah,  I haven't seen anybody else. It's not so easy with your eyes closed. You look... You look different. Did you cut your hair? It's the sweater and the pants. They're Eva's. I had a-a meeting with Ricky's teacher, and when we were in school, the nun's liked Eva a lot more than me, so... What's the problem? Ricky's having a hard time, and his teachers think it's my fault according to Sister Michael, there are a bunch of books on grieving children that I should have read. Plus, I should have him in counseling and... Oh, I shouldn't be working nights. - I'm trying, you know? - Hey... You want me to take this Sister Michael into a back alley somewhere - and work her over a little bit? - You can do that? Yeah. I'm jewish. I have no fear of nuns. That was pretty gutsy... Getting that message out about your son. Well, you do what you have to. Do you think that Nick is in more danger in here because he's a cop? His name's Nick? Y-you know him? It's... hard to explain. I feel responsible. It's because of me's in here. Well, it's not like you invited these guys in here, right? Yeah, right. Hey, hi. Mwah. How you feeling? I'm fine, Egan. Thanks. Well, if I may say, you look absolutely glowing. Doesn't she look glowing, Malcolm? Glowing. Why, thank you. I guess now is as good a time as any to let everybody know... I'm pregnant. Actually, um... we're pregnant. Well, congratulations. Hello, everyone. Thanks for coming in on such short notice. This is assistant district attorney Tim Marley. He'll be prosecuting the case under my supervision. He'll walk you through the preliminary hearing and, uh... Excuse  me. Does anyone know if Nick Cavanaugh is coming? Nick, I gotta get outta here. - I think everybody feels that way. - No, I have a son. You know, he's 7, and it's just me and him. If anything happened to me... - What's his name again, your son? - Ricky. Well, I'm doing the best I can here. If they release another hostage, I'll try to get 'em to choose you. What about the others? You can't have it both ways, Eva. If you leave, somebody else has to stay. Look, you're thinking about Ricky, right? Yeah. Then don't feel bad about it. Thank you. This is a hell of a first date, huh? Well, at... at least we're getting to know each other. Just so you know... I'm not really into the whole bondage thing. Well, I hope we get a second date. I really do. We will. Nick. Yo. Bet to you. In or out? I'm in. The preliminary hearing is just a first step. A judge will hear a brief version of the evidence from a police officer - and decide whether the case should go to trial. - Which it will. Why hold it now in the hospital? Why not just wait and do it in court? We asked for a postponement but the defense objected. If the defense doesn't agree to the delay, we have to hold the hearing within ten days of the arraignment. - Well, why did they object? - Because Lucas' lawyer is a shark. There's gonna be a lot of press at the hearing, and he wants pictures of Lucas looking weak and sick to build sympathy for him for the potential jury pool. At least that's what I assume it is. That's why we need you all at the hospital on the day of the hearing. - So you want us to testify? - No. We just need you to show up, talk to the press, have your pictures taken. Look, this isn't a case about a bank robbery or hostage taking. This is about the killing of two people... Eva Rios and Tom Mitchell. Now they should be here and they're not. We need you there to stand for them, to remind people who this is all for. Carlos Vega. I'm Kathryn Hale. I'm with the L.A. D.A.'s office. I arranged your transfer to Lancaster at the request of Franny Rios. - You got me moved? - I did. Well, then I owe you one... a big one. Must be a relief to be out of Chino. I'm guessing you were getting squeezed pretty bad. Oh, yeah. - Guys wanted serious cash. - Yeah. Like I had an A.T.M. machine in there. Tell me, what was Randall Reese like in Corcoran? - I didn't know him. - No? - Nah. Knew of him. - Mm-hmm. He hung with skinheads. And guys like him and guys like me, we don't really, uh... We don't really get together. You know what I mean? It's just such a coincidence. 12 months after you and Randall were in Corcoran, he and your ex-girlfriend ended up in the same bank robbery? Hey, well, I wouldn't know about that. Unless it wasn't a coincidence. What are you getting at, lady? It's hard not to connect the dots, Carlos... Eva, the bank, Randall, you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You trying to stick this on me? No, I'm just trying to figure out what happened. Like, were you asking for money from Eva before the bank robbery? Okay, yeah, I was asking her for money. But I had nothing to do with that bank robbery. All I know about that is Randall was there and the mother of my child was killed. You've got three months left to do, right? Yeah. If I find any communication between you and Randall Reese... I mean anything at all... I'm gonna make it my job to make sure you spend the rest of your life in jail. I got nothin' to say to you. You're seriously suggesting Eva was involved in the robbery? You and I both know that a lot of bank jobs have someone inside. They came in Smart. Lucas and Randall they took out the security camera. - They knew what the back entrance was. - Yes they did their homework. Homework? They had help. Eva fits the profile. A low-paid employee. Someone not in the bank long enough to develop a real loyalty... Except to her sister, who was also in there. Eva has a criminal record. - A bogus auto theft charge when she was 19. - Maybe. But we know that Carlos was pressuring her for money, and I found out that Carlos and Randall did time in Corcoran together. - Where did you get that? - Ed. So  I went to talk to Carlos. - And what did he have to say? - Nothing. The minute that I asked him about the bank, he clammed up. You're a D.A. You're talking about felony homicide. Of course he clammed up. Randall always treated Eva differently. Until he shot her. Well, maybe he shot her because she snapped. Maybe she was in over her head, and that's why she was freaking out so much. Why are you doing this? You don't think this is hard for me? I was trying to help Franny, and then Ed found out about Carlos and Randall. I vouched for Eva, and now I'm on the hook. What if I'm wrong? How much do we really know about her? Enough to know she wouldn't be involved in this. She was broke and living in her sister's apartment. I've seen people do worse for a lot less money than was in that bank, and so have you. If you were thinking like a cop, Nick, you would say that we should pursue this. Why didn't you bring this to me before? Because I knew how you felt about her, and I just... I wanted to have something solid. Well, you don't. And you should leave this alone. My lawyer told me not to speak with you. Mine told me the same thing. Can we talk anyway, please? Thank you. - How you holding up? - Okay. Good to see you. Um, about this lawsuit... Tom worked for me for a long time, and you know how I feel about what's happened. But I'm here to talk to you as a friend, to tell you to take the bank's settlement offer. Why? The company has a lot of lawyers, Judith. They'll fight this thing for years. They'll make it so expensive for you that you'll quit, and you'll never see a dime. Did the company send you? No. No, no, no, no. Absolutely not. I came on my own. You know what they offered? $43,000. 12 years Tom worked there, the time he put in, and that's what they think his life is worth. I-I don't know what to say. I-I had no idea it was that little. I don't think we should be talking. Good-bye, Malcolm. Grandma, I'm calling to see if Ricky's okay. Like is he crying or... Oh, okay. Well, just call me if he gets upset, okay? Anytime, really. Okay. Besos. Bye. Franny, - heading to work? - Hollywood nightlife waits. - Little something to get you there? - Yeah, thanks. You're looking good tonight. Franny. Oh, hey, Jeremy. Um, this is Marco. What's up, dude? Shot? Uh, no, thanks. - Can we talk? - Sure. About Lizzie... Yeah, actually, um, - that's really great news for you guys. - The point being, I didn't know she was pregnant when you and I got together. It was her secret then. Otherwise I never would've... Okay. And I've only known myself for a couple of weeks now. And I'm trying to figure out what it all means, so... Okay, stop, Jeremy, seriously. You don't have to apologize. I mean, look, we went through this thing. We slept together once. You don't owe me anything. You know, we're not in a relationship. And right now, I actually have to go to work. I understand that the company has to protect its interests, sir, but Tom Mitchell literally gave his life for the bank. I'm aware of our responsibility to the shareholders, sir, but we... Yes, but... I understand. No, thank you for speaking to me this late, Mr. Babbage. Well... They take her to court, Judith might win. - She'll never see a penny. - Oh, you don't know that, and Judith has lawyers to look out for her. You don't have to. Look, honey, can we please go? You know, if we're late, they're not gonna seat us until intermission. Wait a minute. Wait. We met the chairman at that M.S. fund-raiser, didn't we? Malcolm, let it go. - I can't do that. - Yes, you can, and you need to. Look, do you know how long it's been since we had a talk that wasn't about this place? You know, dealing with the police - and hiring new employees and now this lawsuit... - You don't understand! Okay, I'm their main witness. They're gonna be using me against Judith. - Now how can I just let that happen? - Honey, look, I know that you felt helpless in here. There were things that you didn't see, things that you couldn't control, Malcolm. But is this really the way to make up for it? Ed? Ed? So did everything go okay last night at grandma's? Yeah. She sang me a song. She said she used to sing it for mama. It's nice over at grandma's, isn't it? With that big yard? Yeah, and some kids from next door came over. One of 'em said next time I go, I can ride his bike. Ricky... You know how much I love you, right? Sure, aunt Franny. Okay. I just wanted to say it. I'm all right. I'm not hurt. What was he saying to you? Saying? Just now. Uh, I-I don't know. Kathryn Hale. - You know that thing we were talking about before. - Yes. Did you find out anything else? As a matter of fact... You want to hear? Yeah. Eva bought plane tickets to Phoenix for herself and Ricky, one-way. The flights were the day after the robbery. Where did you get that? I can't tell you. Wow. All right. I'll look into it. Bye. Sorry to keep you waiting, Mary. Malcolm, what's up? Why the call? Well... I have been doing some research for the lawsuit, and, uh, I dug up a few things I thought we should discuss. What kind of research? This is an e-mail that I sent last may 17 asking corporate to consider installing bulletproof glass for the tellers and metal detectors at the entrances to improve security. And this is the reply refusing that request because corporate wants to project "a homey and inviting image." I guess bulletproof glass and metal detectors don't exactly say "home." What are you doing, Malcolm? This is another e-mail sent last september 23 asking that our security camera system be updated from analog to digital. And this is the refusal from corporate... - too expensive. - Malcolm, you don't want to do this. This one's pertinent. It's my proposal that we double the number of guards on duty at closing time since that's when most robberies occur. Again, refused by corporate... too expensive. So you're blackmailing the bank? I just think it's important that corporate behave responsibly. This is a mistake, Malcolm. Kathryn Hale. She moved the ticket. What do you mean? She moved the date of the flight three times in the four weeks before the robbery. It's a classic tell for someone on the inside. The date of the job keeps changing, so they keep changing the getaway date. So what do we do? Hey. What's up? We need to talk to you about Eva. So? We think there's a possibility that Eva was involved in the robbery. Maybe she helped Randall and Lucas plan it. You're kidding, right? Oh, my god. No. - Hear us out. - No! No way. We found her criminal record. You mean that thing when she was 19? I don't... She was arrested because Celia Castro lived with us for six months, and Celia was crazy. Celia got everybody in trouble. That was the only bad thing Eva did in her whole life. You really believe this? You? Look, we all know that Carlos was pressuring her for money. Carlos was always asking her for money. You don't think she' rob a bank for it, do you? Franny, we're telling you this because if there's anything to this, we need to know. If the press or a lawyer gets ahold of this, it'll be bad for everyone. How could you think this? She bought a one-way ticket to leave town the day after the robbery. So? She was planning on living with our cousins in Phoenix. - She didn't think L.A. was working out. - She moved it three times, Franny. It's 100 bucks every time you rebook. I know what that kind of money meant to her. Are you gonna tell me she changed it for fun? You really want to know why she changed that ticket? Yeah. Really? It was because of you, Nick. She changed her travel plans because of me? She kept on hoping that something was gonna happen with you, so she changed her ticket, just waiting for you to ask her out. - Oh, come on. - I told her she was an idiot. But you kept on coming in, giving her hope. There you are. Uh... Oh, sorry to interrupt. Um... it's starting. What's he saying? He's telling the judge what was at the scene and what we said in our statements. Isn't that Hearsay? I thought they couldn't do that. At trial they can't, but in a prelim hearing, Hearsay is admissible. He's done. And in ten minutes, the judge will rule, and this will be over. Can't be too soon. Are you all right? What's happening? Kathryn. Randall's atorney has called Felicia to the stand. What? - No. - Absolutely not. I can't prevent it. It's Randall's right to question a witness. How could you let him do this? We objected. The judge is giving him the leeway. Then we are walking out of here. That would be contempt of court. - The judge would issue warrants for your arrest. - I don't want to do this. Why didn't you tell us this could happen? Because he knew we wouldn't show up if he did. Mr. Jones, I'll do everything I can to limit the questions. - I don't want her questioned at all. - For god's sake, the girl doesn't even remember what happened. I'm afraid that doesn't matter. Miss Jones, I want to ask you about what happened in the bank. I can't tell you. I don't remember except for the first few minutes. So I've been told. You have amnesia. You can't remember anything? - No. - No. Uh, so you don't remember Mr. Dalton's very affectionate treatment of you? - No. - Look, this is garbage. Stop it, Mr. Dalton. Uh, you remember things since the robbery though? You remember what you did last week, say? Yes. Then you remember going to visit Mr. Dalton in jail three weeks ago? Because the, uh, the visitor log says that you did. - Your honor, I ask again the relevance here. - I'll tell you. - Mr. Reese... - My brother's trying to blame all this on me. He set this whole thing up, and now he's trying to set me up - again by turning all these people against me. - You're full of it. Go ahead and ask her. Mr. Reese, Mr. Dalton, either one of you speaks again, I'll have you gagged. Miss Jones, you have to answer the question. Um, could somebody repe it, please? Do you remember going to see Mr. Dalton in jail? Yes. And why did you go to see him? I went... - because I felt connected to him. - Connected? Yes, like... Like maybe he had saved me. From what? From him. In the end, the system did what it was supposed to do, and that is hold Randall Reese and Lucas Dalton over for trial. Now I'll take your questions. - Right here, right here. - Dana. I was wrong... about Eva. Yeah? If Eva was involved, Randall would've said so today. No way he wouldn't play that card. - Sorry. - Forget it. You get in the car. I'm taking her home. Hold... hold on one second. Um... All right. You need to pay more attention to your family, Malcolm. Hi. Why do you keep on coming here? - Do you really need to ask? - Yes. You said that I don't owe you anything. But I don't think you believe that. I know I don't. Because there's something here. You've become important to me. Can I come in? Sure. Where's Ricky? He's gonna be staying at his grandma's for a while. It's just much better for him over there. They're Eva's. They don't really fit. - You want some help? - Sure. It really is a lovely view, isn't it? It's not bad. Peaceful. You could almost say calming. I wouldn't go that far. Did you and Kathryn really think that Eva had something to do with the robbery? Franny told me. Yes. But... I don't know why I ever believed it. Well, I think it would make it... easier coping if you thought she was responsible in some way. We all saw how you felt, Nick, what you went through. It's a joke. What is? You meet someone and you think you might... I don't know, y... And then she gets taken away from you. The way I see it, you could meet someone... Know her for two days, or never meet her at all. I know which I'd choose. Good night. I have a feeling. I felt it the first time you walked into the bank... The first time I saw you... That maybe all the bad stuff that's been happening to me... It's gonna end. Like maybe my luck is changing. I felt that way, too. Transcript Made By Raceman
