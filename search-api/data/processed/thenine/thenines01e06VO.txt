We were all in the bank... let's do this thing. All for different reasons. And then... now. In an instant, our lives changed. This will all be over in five minutes. 52 hours later, we came out of there no longer strangers... what are you doing here? It occurred to me that maybe you could e some company. You haven't been goingto your G.A. Meetings. The department mandated six. I did my six. I haven't laid a bet in three months. Bonded forever by what we went through. Do you remember going to visit mr. Dalton in jail three weeks ago? - Hello. - What is it? felicia broke into the bank. I know that I made the 9-1-1 call. How could you not tell me? I'm pregnant. I take my responsibility very seriously. - Why do you keep on coming here? - You've become important to me. It might do you some good to really be where you are. That sounds a lot like something you might say to someone you're in a relationship with. look,I know what you went through together. No,I don't think you do. Do you even have any idea what you are getting into with this guy? Is there something we all need to talk about? What happened in there? TAKE ME INSTEAD HOUR 2    4:27 PM none of you people smoke? I don't have any. well,tom,you look a little better. How do you feel? My head hurts. All right,you've still got to stay down,okay? Take it easy. - it's mine. - Lizzie... it's mine. I told you to turn it off. - I know. - I got it. uh,I-I can... wait. here. Somebody needs to get me a damn cigarette. Forget the cigarette. Please just stop that damn phone! What's that you say? I can't hear you. Please don'T. She's having-- you don't want to keep 'em hanging. Shut up,cop. You got a team full of negotiators out there ready to work for you. Ask 'em for a car,a chopper, a private plane,whatever you want. somehow I don't think I'm gonna get whatever I want. You start sending out hostages, you will. Nobody's leaving here before we do. You got ten people in here. Send out one,get some smokes. It's one less person to cover. Give up a hostage for a pack of cigarettes? Ask for something you want, see if they're gonna cooperate. At least start the process. Otherwise,we're all gonna be sitting here staring at each other until we run out of time. we want to make a trade. Cigarettes and some food. We'll give you one. No,we'll decide. So who wants out,huh? Step right up! Hey,we should talk about this. No,no! Let's see what they think. Any volunteers? The security guard. Wounded go first. Security guard stays. Come on. Don't be shy. Who wants out? mother,don't say anything. It's not up to us. - Hey,randall. - What? It's a democracy. How about a show of hands? - But he's hurt. - Just put your hand up. So you want out? Of course she wants out. We all want out. Take my sister! She has a little boy at home. Sisters,huh? Well, we are definitely not separating you two. Then send 'em both. That's two less people you gotta worry about. - Nobody asked you,cop. - That's enough! Hey,ty-d bol man, how about you? You want out? What,you don't care? You don't want to be free? I think you should let somebody else go,one of the women. Children are first to go. My daughter's back there somewhere. She should go. Try that one. Felicia,honey. It's okay. It's okay,baby. It's okay. Come on out. Everything's gonna be okay. We're gonna get you out of here. Look at me. I promise,okay? Come on with me so we can get you home. It's all right,baby. You're goin' home. we got her. What the hell was she doing in here? She was hiding. It's all right. - So you want to send her? - She's a kid. Yeah,a kid with a pink cell phone. La dee dah. You're the one who did this? - Now wait a minute. - Dad--dad... she didn't know what she was doing. All those cops out there pointing their guns at us-- we would have been out of here by now! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God! There is no way we're sending her out, 'cause she is what's gonna keep the big man in line. Hold on. The cops already know she's in here. They would have traced her cell. The best way to earn yourself some good will,send out a kid. We gotta get this cop outta here. Now wait a minute. Just wait a minute! I have been on the other side of these standoffs. I know exactly what they're thinking out there. I know exactly what their next move's gonna be. You got a line of S.W.A.T. Out there just dying to take over from the negotiators, and i am the guy that can keep them working with you. You need me in here. He's right! I mean,we've all seen the movies. If they've got a cop in here, they're less likely to come in with their guns blazing. Now if you're not gonna take the injured guy, you're not gonna take the girl, take her. What's your name? - na-nancy hale. - Take nancy. She's the oldest. That's gonna win you points out there. Besides,she's been driving you crazy since this whole thing started. Tie me up if you want to, handcuff me. But keep me in here. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> sync:YTET-cflily -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-</font> THE NINE Season 01  Episode 06 </font> ONE MONTH LATER - How's it going? - Hey.

Working hard,you know? So you know what? Listen... I know that this is not the st brilliant timing, but my mother has been after me every day about this lunch thing, you know, so she can finally thank you.

I'm lizzie miller. I was hoping to see lucas. Lift your arms for me. Don't you need to ask him if it's okay? He's been expecting you. - Can I help? - That's okay. I got it. I just found out they're moving you back to county. day after tomorrow. Should be a party. They let me in. They said you were expecting me? Yeah. I was. A couple weeks ago. The D.A.'S office told us not to have any contact with you, that it could hurt the case. But you came anyway? Well,I appreciate what you did. - We all do. - Ambassador of the group, just passing on the message. What do you want me to say? Nothing. You said your piece. You're good to go. All right,well,just make sure that gets filed tonight, and send me the e-mail, and I'll look over it. Thanks--thanks,rachel. I'll,uh... I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. - hey there. - Hey. You,uh... you said "dinner." You didn't say that you were decorating. Champagne? Take this. Give me this. Thank you. Ed,what is-- what is all this? We've been at this for four years now. We've danced around each other. We've gone full throttle, half throttle. Sometimes I wanted to throttle you. But something happened to me when I got the call that you were one of the people inside that bank, when I had to confront the possibility of living the rest of my life without you. Two days later,when you came walking out of there and back to me... I promised myself that I would never risk losing you again. I'm sorry. I'm--excuse me. Now if you're not gonna take the injured guy, you're not gonna take the girl,take her. - What's your name? - Na-nancy hale. Take nancy. She's the oldest. That's gonna win you points out there. Besides,she's been driving you crazy since this whole thing started. Tie me up if you want to, handcuff me. But keep me in here. showtime,lady. Let's go! I'm so sorry I called you. You shouldn't even be here. Get back. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine,okay? she's coming out. First she ings the stuff back, hands if off at the door, then we let her go. You got that? Wait a minute. She needs her purse. She needs her purse.Hey! Just give me one minute-- katie! - Mom,mom! - let her go! - Let her go! - My baby! You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine! No! No,let her go!Mom,you're gonna be fine! Let her go. Let her go! Let go of me! mom,mom,just go! You need to go! Look at me! One more word out of you,lady! One more word! Don't do this toe! look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Don't do this to me! she can't hear you. It's okay. tell me what's happening. it's okay. She's going. - oh my god - what is it? Everything's fine. She's almost there. She's being very brave. What the hell is she doing? - Now what? - Everything is fine. She's just getting the stuff. No. No... no,katie! No,no,no! What the hell? Stay with me. Katie,no! Please,let me go! what the hell? What are they doing? - What is happening? - Stay with me! You've got to let me go,please! God! It's okay. They've got her. They've got her. It's fine. - Don't! - Damn it! She's okay. She's fine. damn... she's safe. She's safe. I'm sorry to call you in on a saturday. If you would renew my prescription over the phone,then I would-- well,I thought this was a nice opportunity to catch up since I haven't heard from you in over a mon. Anything big happen? Lydia,look,I already told you, I don't want to talk about the bank. I don't want to talk about anything. I just need more zenatan. Kathryn... what? What's going on? Ed proposed to me last night. Or tried to,and then I... I just... I couldn't breathe. He started to say the words, and I just... I couldn'T... I couldn't get any air. And what happened? I hid in the bathroom until I was calm and then... by the time I came out to apologize... ed was incredibly understanding as always, and he just--I don't know, he said we could table it. So things are... yeah,back to normal, whatever that means. Have you been having the attacks again since the bank? No,actually that... that one was the first. So what we're saying is, bank trauma,no problem, marriage proposal,big problem? - It's not marriage. - Then what? Is it ed? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. There is someone from the bank. I've only known him for a couple weeks, but I've been thinking about him, which is so ridiculous, because I've known ed for four years! And I go through this thing with this guy for two days,and I... well,let's be honest. You've always been ambivalent about ed, and I never thought it had anything to do with ed. But that's the thing... is that... since the bank, I have been open to ed and needing ed. And it's been okay. But then there's this other man. yeah. Nick. hello? Hey,how's it going? It's jeremy. Hey,what's up? I was just checking in to see if you got inted tohat poker game over at nick's tonight. Yeah,egan called, but I don't really play cards,though,so... I don't know. Yeah,same here. But... there's this party over at my neighbor's house. It's a charity thing. He's a music industry guy. I think it'll be pretty fun. I was,well,wondering if you'd want to go. Um,sure. That'd be cool. All right. Well,it starts around 10:00. I was thinking that maybe I could pick you up around 80 and,uh... and we could grab some dinner first, unless you wanted to just meet me there. No,no,no. Dinner would be great. Okay,great. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Thanks again for doing this. It means a lot to her. Hey,it's a step up from the diner. Oh,I'm supposed to say hello from egan. He's,uh,pretty devastated you're not coming to this thing tonight. Thank you. Poker,huh? Yeah. No,I-I just was a little surprised. I didn't think that you did that anymore. Look,whatever you heard from ed was overstated. Oh,thanks. I had a bad period last year after my divorce. I made a few mistakes, played with some people I shouldn't have, but that's it. It's over. Anyway,it was egan's idea. We're playing for nickels. You should come. oh,I am so sorry. The driver insisted on taking the 405. Oh,well. Ah,good.Thank you,enrique. We'll have the champagne now. oh,mom, that's not really necessary. Well,you're not on duty, are you? Nope. Day off. Good,then I insist. I'm appallingly overdue in paying tribute to this man's heroism,and I intend to do so properly. You know,I'm not sure I deserve to be-- I will have none of your modesty. You were coolheaded and shrewd, certainly more so than those flak-jacketed brutes that dragged me off the plaza. Aha,here we are. Oh,this is lovely. Yeah? Well... To detective nicholas cavanaugh, who saved my life, and to my daughter kathryn, who is finally beginning hers. What are you talking about? Oh,dear. Did things not go as planned? I... I'm sorry. Did I miss something? Oh,I just-- I-- mother,mother,mother, we'll discuss it later. They have a great crab salad here.  don't take me! Don't come near me! You understand? Because they're gonna shoot my daughter in there if you come near me in any way! Okay? - Oh,dad! - Trojans beat oregon! I can smell the roses. Come on,let's go to the homecoming rally. No,I gotta finish this book. You know,you used to beg me to take you to those things when I'd take your brothers. You'd even do the trojan cheer for me. Yeah,I was like 10. Honey,you have had your nose in this thing all day. It's time for you to take a break with your old man. If you're nice to me,I'll give you a sip of my beer. What about mom? I forwarded all the calls to my cell phone. Get your shoes on. Let's go,come on! it's not like I'm asking for a penthouse,a house in bel-air. For 2 grand a month, a person should be entitled some light,some space. The one in century city wasn't bad. It was century city adjacent at best. How about the one in north hollywood? That had plenty of light. Right on the 134? All the noise,the pollution? Egan,it's not like you're gonna retire there. No,but I might want to entertain occasionally. You know,maybe get a regular poker game going,huh? You'd better hurry. There's a car coming at 6:00. You know,I just want to know why my mother casually let it drop that we were celebrating my engagement. Well,that must have been awkward given the circumstances. I mean,what did you do,ask for my hand in marriage when you know how I feel about my mother? I mean,what is this,the '50s? Were the two of you working out my dowry? Right,your mother-- that's the issue here. No,ed,the issue is that it's more important to you that everybody thinks you're swell than it is to show me fundamental respect and consideration. "Respect and consideration"? You know, it makes me wonder. I mean,do you have any idea who I am or what it is that i want? You don't know what you want, which is why you came over here to pick a fight with me, so you don't have to deal with yourself. - Don't put this on me. - No,this one's all you. Now,I love you,kat. You know I do. But I put myself out there, and you literally ran away. Now putting my feelings aside-- which,by the way, is kind of a pattern here-- putting my feelings aside, you need to get clear on what you're doing, because if we're not moving forward, I don't know where we're going anymore. You can let yourself out. Do you usually goto the bathroom this much? I'm nervous. Yeah,well,I can't keep walking you back here. This is the last time. I'm pregnant. That's why. - Don't let randall find out. - I won'T. I mean it. It won't be good if he finds out. - Why? - Just trust me. And nobody else should find out either. And tell your boyfriend not to say anything. He won'T. He doesn't know yet. What's your name? Lucas. Thank you,lucas. Oh,sorry. Oh,it's okay. Uh,I was just headed out. Cologne? Yeah,I gotta go to this charity thing. You have a date? I thought it was a little too soon for full disclosure. No,it is... too soon. Well,I'm running late. I should go. Have a good time. You got an open seat? You're the first one here. Where is everyone? Egan's out getting ice or,uh,guacamole. Can I get you something? Uh,yeah,I'll take one of those bad boys. Thanks. I thought you had a thing with ed. Yeah,last-minute change of plans. - Lucky for us. - Thanks. You see something you want to put on? Uh,you pick. I didn't know you had a sister. That's my ex-wife. she's really pretty. It's a good picture of my mom. Ed... ed proposed to me. Was that the,uh, second half of your mom's toast? Yeah,apparently. Good for you. well,I haven't answered him yet. Really? But he's a good guy. Well,I'm kind of a commitment-phobe. Aren't we all? kathryn hale! Hey! - Hey! - Hi. My evening is complete. - Hey,and look who I found outside. - Hey,there. Hey,you made it with the whole family. Yep,well,I figure she's off to college soon. She might as well learn how to play cards,right? Well,here's to her education. And gene's coming,too. We're gonna have a full house. Egan,I cannot get enough of this guacamole. What is in this? Some call it cilantro. I call it fiesta. Call. 2 pair. Kings and 7s. - Trip 6s. - Hello! is this good? let me see. Yogot four,no,five jacks with a wild card. Honey,that means you won. You're a natural-born genius. All right,here we go. - Get your money,babe. - Sweet innocence. it's your mother. Sit out the next hand. Um,hey,honey. - Come on,egan. - It's your deal. Um,we're just,uh, taking it easy,you know? Ing to the wife about poker. very old-scol. No,it's not lying. It's bluffing. hey,she's learning. - very nice. - Okay,uh,7-card stud. Ante up. And deuces, one-eyed jacks wild. Oh,come on. Playing with two wild cards is not poker. Who's up for a round of hold'em? $5,$10 blinds. Cavanaugh's getting restless. All right. I'm sorry I was out of line with you before. I'm just... scared about everything I have to face. I know. I guess you are,too. I don't know what I am lately. It all got turned upside down,didn't it? Yeah. Can I get you anything? It is your last night. You could sit with me. these arms of mine they are lonely lonely and feeling blue I am really sorry for dragging you to that thing. Those people... somehow I don't think they were all there for animal rescue,huh? you think? Did you see that one lady in the leather pantsuit? A mujer con un trajeI mean,come on. How many cows do you think were killed to make that thing? oh,wait. What? What? You said "pantsuit." Who says "pantsuit"? Shut up. Pantsuit. My mother used to wear those. You are such a white boy. Do that dance move for me again. What,do you mean this one? oh,no. they are burning I had a really good time tonight. Burning from wanting you me,too. These arms of mine this is the most... uncomplicated I've felt in a long time. ...Wanting to hold you and if you would let them are we really doing this? Oh,how grateful I will be come on come on,baby just be my little woman just be me lover - nick's got cards. - Scared? not yet. Call. Calling and flopping. two ladies showing. check. what? Do you think they changed on you? 10. I'm jumping off this train,boys. You can't handle it. 10 and raise 10. Check,raise. Very sly. Too hot for me. I'm getting out of the kitchen. What do you have,my friend? Well,there is one more queen besides the one in your hand, and I think I have the better kicker. Your thoughts,milady? You can hang. here goes nothing. Fourth street. 10. - I think you're bluffing. - Then raise me. - I will. - Reraise. Raise you back. this is a rush. What do you say we go no limit? Bring it on,my friend. Guys,come on. What are you doing? We're playing cards. $240. I'm all in. all right. I got $180 on the table. -,do you accept cash? - Why not? All right,let's see... $20,$40 and $60. Okay. This is ridiculous. Okay,alpha dogs. Let's see 'em. Three sisters. I hit my straight. Sorry,bud. Burned by lady luck. I should have known. I'm playing with a shark. Wait a minute,you were... you were betting on a straight draw? I got my lucky 7. Yeah,but that was the last card. I mean,you should have dropped out after the flop. You had nothing, and you kept on raising? I was bluffing. Yeah,but you knew had three queens. I won the hand,didn't I? Is there a problem? No,no,no. It'S... it's fine. Whatever. Uh,anyone up for some more,uh,guacamole? There was this card game last night at nick's, and there was this moment where he won this really big hand, and there was just something about it that made me snap. How do you mean? I don't know. I T... I got really angry. I don't know why. He could have lost everything, and then he just happened to get the right card. And maybe that's great card-playing,but it's just... it's like this guy is willing to bet everything on a wing a prayer and just kind of hope it works out? I mean,this is crazy! What was I even doing there? What do you think you were doing there? I don't know. I'm wondering why this is suddenly so urgent for you. Well,because ed is... well,he's kind of thrown down the gauntlet. I-I think I've,uh... I've finally pushed him to his limit. So... this may be a fork in the road? I don't know what's wrong with me. Why am I resisting someone that I have loved for four years, who has been there for me again and again? Well,you and nick went through something incredibly powerful together. It's not easily dismissed. Yeah. I used-- I used to take these walks on the beach when I was kid, and I would... I would pick up the brightest shells, the ones with the strongest greens and purples and reds. And then when I got home, I'd put them on the windowsill, and they just-- I don't know. They seemed pale and dusty, you know, like they couldn'T... they couldn't survive outside the saltwater. Is that how you feel about nick? That he can't survive out in the world? That what we had inside the bank won't survive outside in the world. hey! Do not move. Cuff the post first. That's fine. Now me. That's fine. Not so tight. I'm sorry. thanks for speaking up before about keeping me in. It helped. you--move! I think we all feel better having you here. all right,come on. Morning. Hey,uh,sorry. I was hoping to finish by the time you got up. No sweat. It's been worse. There's coffee. Are you,uh, actually going to apply to this hellhole? Oh,I wouldn't call it a hellhole. More like a mousehole. Look,this is ridiculous. Take back the money. - I'm not taking the money. - I don't want it. - You won it fair and square! - I was an ass last night,okay? - I pushed you into it. - I wasn't pushed. I was playing poker. It was actually surprisingly thrilling,worth every penny, and if you keep trying to give me back the money, then i am gonna feel like the ass. Oh,nick,come on. You just paid your first month's rent. Keep looking for a place, but in the meantime, stick around... if you don't mind the couch. Okay. Thank you. you know, you're the only one who knows... what happened between me and jeremy. You haven't talked to anybody about it? I haven't even talked to him about it. There's really nothing between us now but silence. And a child. What happens when someone's pointing a gun at you is not who you are. I can tell you that. don't let your mind get weary and confused your will be still don't try don't let your heart get heavy,child inside you there's a strength that lies ed? Don't let your soul get lonely,child it's only time it will go by don't look for love in faces places it's in you that's where you'll find - hey. - Hey. I let myself in. How was the mayor? Mayoral. I'm sorry I wasn't there. I'm sorry I've been such an idiot. I guess you've been reconsidering the part about not wanting to lose me twice. well,maybe I never had you. Eddie,I been thinking about it a lot, and I-I know I have been all over the place, but for what it's worth, I feel clear now, and... I know that you probably feel that you can't trust that, but... I want you to try. What does that mean,"try"? Will you do me the honor of finishing what you were asking me the other night? Please. I wasn't planning on doing this in my underwear. Kathryn hale... will you marry me? Oh,my god. That ring,that'S... that's my grandmother's ring. Where did you get that? Ah,your mother, god bless her, said to me very early on that if I ever wanted to take things to the next level, she had the ring. So last week,I called her and said I was ready. It looks good. Ooh. What's that for? it's good to have you home. Oh,I should go away more often. What'd you and felicia do? That girl is positively sparkling. Well,nothing special. Just a good time with her dad. Not too many left before she's off to college. So you,uh,ever hear back from the alarm company? Oh,yeah,they came by. Said it was a broken window sensor or something. - So they fixed it?
