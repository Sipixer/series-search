you could use some company. - I don't want you to think that I expect to freeload. - You're my guest. Kathryn Hale. Something happened to me when I got the call that you were one of the people inside that bank. - Ed proposed to me. - Good for you. Well, I haven't answered him yet. - Do you want to talk about it? - About what? - About what happened in there. - A lot of things happened in there. It was a moment, Lizzie. Does it have to mean everything? - There's really nothing between us now but silence. - And a child. This is the most uncomplicated I've felt in a long time. There'll always be a job for you here. I don't think I'll ever be able to go in there. Now if you're not gonna take the injured guy, you're not gonna take the girl, take Nancy. She's the oldest. - That's gonna win you points out there. - Showtime, lady. First she brings the stuff back, hands it off at the door, - then we let her go. - No! My baby! You're gonna be fine! You're gonna be fine! No! - What is happening? - Let me go, please! It's okay. They've got her. They've got her. Hour 4 - 6:02 PM Mrs. Hale, I know how difficult this is for you. But if you could just try and focus. His eyes are a little more nazi germany, but from what I can stand to recall about him, it's a good likeness. Thank you. The more we know about him, the easier it'll be for us to get your daughter out of there. What else can you tell me about the other people inside? There's the two gunmen, the - security guard, uh... - Yes, you told us that earlier. - There's a police officer. - There's a cop inside? Yeah, contact the five nearest police stations. Have them radio all detectives, call every cell. Fax me a list of nonresponders. It won't be long before they figure out I'm in here. They'll use me to help. Do you think that my mother's still out there? Now what can you tell us about the other people in there, Mrs. Hale? There was a doctor. He had on, you know, he was wearing all that... - all that... that blue. - John, check with the local hospitals. Find out who's missed surgeries or rounds. Go. Oh, and he's in there with his girlfriend. I can't. No one else is eating. - I can't, right? - It's Friday night. My parents will be expecting us both for Shabbat dinner soon. And when we don't show... Looking to I.D. the doctor now. No. No, I told you. He looks like he's 12 years old. I... Wait, that's him. Yeah, that's him. - Jeremy Kates with a "K." - Yes. - Find his family. - Got it. Do you think mom knows by now? She'll be all right. - Do you think she's out there? - This picture's a few years old. It'll do just fine, Mrs. Jones. What do you need it for? Shouldn't you be concentrating on the robbers? We're building psychological profiles of everyone inside the bank. We need to get a complete landscape of all the personalities that we'll be dealing with in there. - Personalities? - How we get your husband and daughter out of there depends as much on who the hostages are and how they behave as on the robbers. Hey, you think he'd let me bum a smoke? I doubt it. Tom Mitchell, security guard. Got his wife on the phone. Says she's too sick to come down. My wife made me quit five years ago. She'd probably excuse anything under these circumstances. That's not his nose. That nose is all wrong. That's nothing like his nose. His nose is more bulbous than that. - Can you fill in any more details about the man? - I told you, he is unkempt, he is a frightened person, he's wearing a yellow shirt, he has a blue sleeve and glasses, and those glasses are all wrong. - Hey, you want some pizza? - No. Uh, lactose intolerant. Be better for all of us if I didn't. Only person we could find connected with the Rios sisters is a grandmother... Consuela Hernandez. Trying to get ahold of her. If Ricky's not with grandma... You got that message out. He is. What if he's standing outside his school alone, waiting for me? Grandma's got him, okay? - Are they terrorists in there? - What do they want? From what we heard on the 9-1-1 call, it was supposed to be a straightforward bank job till the robbers got slowed down. You I.D. the robbers yet? One of 'em so far... Randall Reese. He's got two strikes. This would be his third. So if he doesn't want to go back to jail for the rest of his life... This would be his blaze of glory. 6 weeks later. You got a speech on Mount Sinai this morning or... No, no, no. Just, uh, considering my gear. I've got my tent, my ditty bag, which are of obvious relevance, although my trekking poles and my walking staff, I don't know, - might be redundant. - I've never been to big bear myself. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. Uh... It's just that every time Mary and I went away, which wasn't often, she always insisted on packing for me. And I hated it. 'Cause who doesn't want toose which pair of underwear he wants to wear when, right? You're gonna miss her in some odd ways, man, mostly the way she made you miserable. It'll pass. I know. - Don't start any forest fires. - All right. - You watch your back out there. - Yeah, yeah. The Bloc Team presents to you The Nine Episode 7 - Outsiders Transcript Made By Raceman Subtitles Made By The Bloc Team Synchronised By Tagne For www.forom.com I see your son has a sizeable debt. $200,000? Hour 5 - 7:36 PM That's from medical school, a student loan. He made a point of wanting to pay for his own education. Yet he accepted your gift of a $3-million beach condo. When your 21, you can afford to be righteous. When you're 30, you're exhausted. I guess he wanted a nice place to sleep. - What can you tell me about his girlfriend? - She's a caretaker. - A social worker. - A little hard to get to know at first, but it's just strength. She's had to be very strong. - Her own family had problems. - Abuse? Mental illness? She has a severely autistic brother. Her parents gave all their attention to the boy, it tore their marriage apart, and then they put the boy in a home. Lizzie left Wisconsin to get away from all that. - You seem to know her very well. - Yes, we're very close. My son is an only child. Lizzie's like a daughter to me. Oh, god. Lizzie. Oh, hi, Sheryl. It's so good to see you. Hi. It's been so long. I never get to see him anymore. And, you know, a mother can only give so much space before she... Before she shows up and hijacks you for a mediocre cafeteria lunch. I'll take whatever I can get. Uh, so anything new with you? You look so thin. Well, she's been... she's been working a lot, ma. Hey, why don't you go ahead, and I'll meet you down there? Okay? I have to talk to Lizzie about a patient. - Yeah, we should do that. - Okay. Why haven't you told your parents I'm pregnant? Look... You kept this a secret. You're still not even sure how much you want from me. So was I to assume that you'd want doting grandparents out of them? You know them, Lizzie. My mother will show up on your doorstep with pink-and-blue wallpaper and a crib, and my father will start picking out biblical names. Do you want that? Why haven't you seen your family? You were so close. Why are you hiding things from them? If I tell them that you're pregnant, and I tell them that it's mine, they're gonna want to know what happened in there to make us not... It's her... again. Tell my mother no wedding talk at work. Ugh! Yeah? You did not bring those for me. No. I pilfered them from candice in misdemeanors. She was on her way up here. I thought I'd save you from the high-pitched girlie fever. - Thank you. - You're welcome, Hillary. Or Mrs. Clinton if you'd prefer. - I heard that one a couple of times today. - You've gotta be kidding me. Well, your boss/fianc√© is gonna be the next D.A. Yeah, well, I think I've earned my own identity here. And Ed and I prepared for any potential complications. - Am I early? - No. Come on in. - Of all the gin joints... - Yeah, I know. I can't believe we never caught a case together after all these years. Thanks. Wow. - You said yes. - I asked if I could try it on for a couple of days, see, uh, see how eternity felt. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - Everybody know? - I don't know. I didn't phone tree everybody. I've just been trying to keep it mellow. Good luck with that. - So should we get cracking? - Yeah. I see your husband was a football player at U.S.C. Hour 6 - 8:04 PM He was suspended from the team for fighting. That fight was with his no-good brother, who came up to a game all the way from Pittsburgh to say who did Malcolm think he was, turning his nose up to where he came from. So there are problems with his family? No, no, there were no problems as long as he gave them money when they asked for it. - Why does he do that? - Because he takes care of his own, no matter what. Your daughter's lucky he's in there with her. And he cares about those other people, too... Eva, Franny... I mean, they're just like family. Hey. - Why didn't you tell me Eva had a safety deposit box? - Oh, Franny. - This is her stuff, Malcolm. - I know. Well, I would've led to have known. You're right. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm sorry. I'm just... It's just now I have to open that damn box, you know? Well, if you're not ready to go inside, I can do it for you. I'll bag up the contents and bring it out to you. - Kathryn. - Hmm? Sorry, sorry. I just, um... One of my colleagues was razzing me earlier about something, so I'm a... What was he saying? That once I marry Ed, I'm just gonna become the girl behind the guy. Never happen. You're too good at your job. How do you know how good I am? When I work with somebody, I check up on 'em. Yeah, well, your record's pretty damn spotty, but I'll take my chances. What, you see a ghost? Kinda. My ex-wife. So you worked with Cavanaugh for almost six years? Hour 6 - 8:18 PM So what kind of cop is he? Smart, brave, good judgment. Come on, detective. I just looked at his file. - Smart and brave, maybe. - He made mistakes, had some personal problems... Not so unusual in this line of work. - So he got a divorce last year. - Again, not so unusual in this line of work. His ex worked on the force in the same department. - That's where they met, yeah. - What was their relationship like? He said potato, she said moo shu pork. Her risk-junkie crap played into his weaknesses, she sucked him into trouble. You look good, Nick. You tracked me down, Juliana? I went down to the station. The boys said that you were here. What's it been, six months? - Well, it's been nice catching up. - Nick... - I need something from you. - I don't doubt it. - I think I've been made. - What? I've been deep in this narcotics case forver a month, and I'm... I'm getting a bad feeling. - You're getting a bad feeling? - I've got a bad feeling, okay? Would I drive here all the way from San Diego with my tail between my legs for nothing? - Talk to me. - You still have that contact, that C.I. connected to the Los Inmortales gang? Miguel. Yeah. But he's on the fringes, Juliana. - I haven't worked with him for over a year. - Yeah, but can he confirm or deny whether or not these guys know I'm a cop? Nick, I can't go home. I can't go to work. I-I can't get a cup of coffee without looking over my shoulder. All right, I'll call Miguel. Now why don't you go back to the station and hang out with the boys for a little while? Or maybe you could just give me the keys to our place. - Your place. - Go back to the station. - She's hot. - Juliana... - You have a thing there? - She's engaged. - Didn't stop us. - Go. Is he a man of faith like you, Rabbi Kates? Hour 5 - 7:42 PM Well, he's a doctor. If people are hurt, he'll be a man of action. - Of course, if people are hurt... - Will he be protective of his girlfriend? - Absolutely, yes. - Oh, yes. He loves her. Yes. So what's going on with you? - What do you mean? - What do I mean? Well, what happened between you and Lizzie for one? You were looking for engagement rings before the whole thing, and now there's nothing between you? I don't want to talk about that. - Why? - Ma, please. Have you been to a therapist? Because I broke up with my girlfriend? Because you experienced things I lie awake imagining because you won't tell me. I'm fine, mom. I am. You saw me the very next day. There wasn't a scratch on me. What kind of mother would I be if I believed you? The merciful kind? Baby, look at me. Look at me. Why don't you come to shabbat dinner tonight? - You always loved it, and we really miss you. - I gotta work, mom. Please just come and be with us sit at our table. We'll light the candles, say the blessings and eat together. I swear, we won't ask any questions. How you doing? I'm great. Let's go. It's, uh, this one right here. - Okay, ready? - Yeah. Thanks, grandma. I thought I was getting these. - What is it? - Letters to Eva, and this one's dated four months ago. - Who are they from? - My mother. I haven't seen her in 20 years. Do you mean that Franny or Eva have any *** problems? No. Franny goes out every night. Hour 6 - 8:23 PM She should have a health problem, but she's strong like a horse. Any history of mental health issues? Her good-for-nothing mother. My own daughter I'm talking about. Ana left when Franny was 4, Eva was 8. - So she won't be any help to us? - If you find her, you let me know. I see in 1996,you pressed charges against Franny for stealing. Franny received a call from her crazy cousin Angela, lives in Salt Lake City. Swears she sees Franny's mother. Franny wants me to buy her a plane ticket to chase a ghost. I said no. Franny's stubborn. She stole my credit card. - So you called the cops on her. - Franny goes all this way, she finds this woman. It's not her mommy. Of course it's not Ana. That's why I dropped the charges, okay? My whole childhood, my grandma always told me "We are better off with her gone. We're better off with her gone." Then the years went by, and I made myself think that she was dead. And now... Now I find out that she has lived 20 minutes away from me for five months, and Evie didn't tell me. I mean, how can she not tell me? How can she have these letters and move in with me and look me in the eye over breakfast and lunch and... and at work and the whole time in there? - Well, I'm sure she had her reasons. - Yeah, well, her reasons aren't good enough. I mean, look... my mother writes... "my mother writes," I'm actually saying that. "Evie, please come and see me so we can talk." And I'm the big jerk, you know? I don't even know if she went. I don't know what they talked about... Or if she asked about me. Why does Miguel want to meet you in person? Look, I don't love it either, but he doesn't want to talk on the phone, and you need an answer, right? What'd you do to get yourself into this mess, Juliana? I'm an undercover cop, Nick, not a soccer mom. It's a dangerous business. Why is everything always my fault? Well, did you compromise yourself in any way? Did you get too close to your mark? - Were you drinking when you buddied up with these guys? - I'm not your father, Nick. - Must we have this conversation 11,000 times? - Fair enough. So how's my car? I traded it in for a hybrid. - How's my dog? - Misses you. - Pisses in my shoes sometimes. - That's my boy. The best deal and... Firefighters responded to a multiple alarm blaze last night at a commercial warehouse located at York and Figueroa in Highland Park... - Hey. - How are you? Good. So... I'm going to my parents' house tonight for dinner. - You are? - Yes. And... I'm going to tell them about the baby. - You're gonna tell them about the baby. - Mm-hmm. - And nothing more? - That's right. But... y-you said yourself, they're not gonna settle... I-I know what I said. I'm hurting them by not seeing them. They don't deserve that. And they swore they wouldn't push, so... What do you want me to tell them about reaching out to you? I want you to have them if you want them. You should have the support. I really miss them. I know that sounds selfish and weird. Well, they were a part of your life. You can come with me if you want. Think about it. Love is all I want. Love is all... I came down, you know? To the bank, during the standoff... They used me to profile you. I was wondering why it went to hell. I called you after to see how you were doing. I got your message. Thanks. So you took in that happy-sad hero guy Egan, huh? I staked out your house a little. That's terrific. I was paranoid, okay? I was scared to see you and... Like, would you be this totally different person after what you went through? That's him. That's Miguel? Yeah, that's him. Stay in the car. I'm not an idiot. Juliana, get down! Get down! Stop! Stop! So you want me to attest to him as a cop or an ex-husband or what? - So who ended the relationship? - I did. Then he did. Hour 7 - 9:13 PM Then I did. - But he officially filed for the divorce. - He was better at paperwork than I was. Is he gonna play nice with us in there? Depends... How he thinks you're doing out here. So he likes control? He'll do what he has to do. No matter how dangerous? The more dangerous, the better. Wow, looks exactly the same... minus all my crap. Make yourself at home. You sure you're all right, me being here? You want something to drink? I'd love a beer. Thank you. Barukh atah adonai, eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu l'hadlik neir shel shabbat. Amein. Barukh atah adonai, elohnu, melekh ha'olam borei p'riy ha-gafen. Amein. Jeremy, would you like to say the blessing over the bread? Uh, sure. Barukh atah adonai, eloheinu, melekh ha'olam ha-motzi lechem min ha-aretz. - Amein. - Amein. How do I even know that she's home? All right, I can't take it anymore. I have to face her. - I mean, we have come all this way. - Franny, we've come 20 minutes. If you're not ready... Wait, you're supposed to tell me I have nothing to be afraid of. You have a lot to be afraid of. But who gives a damn? Thanks. Everything looks so good. I want to welcome Jeremy back to our table, to welcome Lizzie. These chairs have been empty for... We have news. You're back together. No, no. We're not. Lizzie is pregnant. Mom, dad, you're going to be grandparents. Well... Well, I-I'm at once overjoyed and heartbroken. I-I know I promised not to ask any questions, but I don't understand. It's me. Things happened to me during those two days inside the bank. - I came out all turned around and confused... - Stop. Lizzie and I can't be together, despite the child we are about to have, because of me. We had been trapped inside the... the bank for hours and hours, and... the security guard had just been killed. I've seen people die on my table, but this... this was... You were scared for your life. One of the gunmen... grabbed me and Lizzie, and he took us away from the others. He took us... into the back, into a-a hallway... and there was a door at the end of it, an... an exit door. And the gunman got distracted for a few seconds. And I ran. I ran to the door... away from Lizzie... to save myself. Now I never made it out, of course. The... the gunman stopped me there before I could. And then I thought... He's gonna shoot me. But... in that moment... I was more afraid of turning around and facing you. And when I did... The look on your face... I'll never forget it. Betrayed... Abandoned... I did that to you. Hi. Um... Hi. Are you Ana's daughter? Yes. Okay. Oh, my god. Go inside. Franny? Hi. So what broke you two apart? I was always right and he was always wrong. It got in our way a little. Hour 7 - 9:22 PM I see there was a domestic violence call in 2003. - Does he have a temper? - Look, we fought a lot. I'd scream bloody murder, the neighbor would call the cops, but Nick wouldn't lay a hand on a woman. In fact, I think I hit him that night. Because it wasn't a mistake in San Diego. Because... because I need him. Because I trust him. No, no. No, I don't think so. Captai I've definitely been made. I don't know. I don't know. Dominick's guys could show up anywhere, hit me when I'm least expecting it. I don't know what to do. Maybe. Maybe I could lay low here for a while. Well, I don't know if I'm safe. How do I know? Get off the phone. Uh, let... let me call you back. First of all, you're all right. - I know. - You're all right. - You're alive, okay? - Okay. I got three squad cars stationed outside. Nobody's gonna get to you here. I can't even believe I got you into this. Of course I did. I came to you looking for help. - I don't even know what I was thinking. - Hey, we'll figure it out. What are we gonna do, Nick? We'll figure it out. Are... are you sure you don't want to come inside? We can sit in the living room. - I can make you some tea. - Did Eva come here? - Yes. Once. - When? Four months ago. - What happened? - I blew it. She came to check me out. - I wrote her and said I'd moved to town... - So you didn't want to write me? I was a coward. I didn't think you would remember me. Well, I don't. I don't remember you. - What's your little girl's name? - Tiffany. Did Eva meet her? Tiffany was at school that day. - So Eva didn't meet her? - Eva loved you a lot. She didn't want me coming anywhere near you till she saw me for herself. - And you listened to her? - I was afraid of her, honey. I'm afraid of you right now. What can I do to you? - What can I take from you? - Oh, Franny. No, what can I possibly take from you that can compare with what you've taken from me? - I've always loved you. - Oh, god, don't say that. I always did. I wanted everything to go so well when Eva final came over here. She was really angry with me, like she should have been. And instead of taking all the stuff she needed to say like I should've, like a mother would, I defended myself, and we fought, and she left. But I told myself that I would see her again... that someday, she would bring you to me. So... that happened. You didn't have to jump in there like that - and lie for me. - I wasn't lying, not really. It's just, we never talked about what happened. I know. And... when I heard you say it out loud and when I watched you say it out loud, - I felt so guilty. - Why? You hurt me, Jeremy. You really did. And I have been so wrapped up in my own pain since we got out of there... That I forgot you've been really hurt, too. Thank you for coming. Thank you for having me. Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you for your support. - Of course. - Hey. - Hey. - Want to get a cup of coffee? - Yes. Thank you. So... am I arm candy? What? Well, I just... I see that Alex isn't here or Marley. So I'm wondering if I'm on the list because I'm A.D.A. Kathryn Hale or because I'm Ed Nielson's future wife. Hey... You are here because you earned it. I'm here because you needed a date to this awful thing. Thanks. Hey, Nick. - Uh, what are you doing here? - Crashing. Hi. - Ed, how are you? - Nick. - Can I talk to him for a minute? - Yeah, sure. - I'll bring him right back. - Okay. I can't wait to hear this. I need your help with sething, Ed. Okay. The life of a fellow cop is in danger. Well, who's the cop? - My ex-wife. - Ms. Hale. Mm. Excuse me. Mr. Mayor, hello. You surprised to see me actually attending my own function? Uh, no, no, just... to be candid, I'm just... I'm surprised you know my name. - Well, don't be. I've had my eye on you. - Really? I keep close tabs on all the best prosecutors in the department. And after the bank crisis... Well, let's just say you've become quite an inspiration - to a lot of people. - So what do you think I can do? You can use every channel you've got to get the word out fast to every associate of this gang that two of their lieutenants... the guys that shot at her last night... have been arrested, they're in custody and they're talking. Whoever's got their finger on the trigger better back the hell off. And that I'm prepared to wage a major crackdown if they don't? What about your people? I got all my informants putting out the word, but I'm not convinced it's enough. You're the trump card. All right, I'll see what I can do. - I can't guarantee they'll listen. - Thank you. And, uh, congratulations on your engagement. May I have my office contact your office and set up a lunch? I'd like to talk to you about your future. Yes, sure. Of course. Good. Thank you. Nick, hey. - How was your trip? - Good, good. Great. Um... Why did I get frisked on my way in here? Um... it's a long story. - Have you seen Ju... - Julia. - Juliana. - Juliana. Yes, yes, yes. Nice woman. Pulled a gun on me when I walked in the door. Apologized, hugged me, told me I should, uh, take care of you, and then, uh, slipped out the back, Jack. Made a new plan, Stan. Um... she left this note. Sorry I dragged you into this, stay safe. Jules. Hour 8 - 10:19 PM Hi. Who do you belong to? - Those two. - You? - That your daughter? - God, where did that come from? - Let's go. - Gunshots from inside the bank, northeast corner. Repeat, gunshots from inside the bank. S.W.A.T., prepare to go green.
