My van has smelled like blue cheese for, like, 5 years. I don't care. That's true. Why are you sabotaging Sasha's time with the kids? I am not. Yes, you are. Please! Anyone who is sleeping with you Is taking a hit for the entire female species, gary. I mean, I appreciate that, ok? But I-I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna bend the rules Just because sas has some silly arcade plans. You're jealous 'cause the kids have fun with sasha. Ok, why would I be jealous?

All right. Ok. Gary, I hope you didn't go overboard. Don't worry. I won't. Curtis, how could you do that to me, man? You sold me down the river with sasha. You told me to set the bar low. I made a fool out of myself. Why? What did you get her? I t her terry cloth wristbands and a matching headband. A-are you crazy? I didn't mean set it that low. Seriously, wristbands? And a matching headband. Why does everybody leave out the headband? That is only a good valentine's day gift If you're dating 1977 john mcenroe. Are you dating 1977 john mcenroe? No. Then why did you buy athletic equipment For 1977 john mcenroe? I don't know. I freaked out. I made a mistake, ok? But now I'm in deeper trouble, 'cause I told her the real gift is at my house.

All right, I gotta go. See yolater. [knocking on door] Hey, gary. Hi. Hey, what's up? Come on in. Ooh. Am I here to watch you sign the declaration of independence? I can't get it out. I need your help. Ok. Ow, ow, ow. That hurts a lot. There you go. Ok. Here. Come on in. Sorry I'm late. I would have called But I decided not to sweat it. Ah ha ha! Yeah! Right? Those things. L-o-l. I can't believe you thought that was your real gift. Which means you're really gonna go crazy when you see Your real valentine's day gift. Ah hah hah. Ooh. I love the store, conundrum. Yeah, it's nice. I got you a gift receipt for you, In case you wanna return it, But I think their printer was broken, 'cause they put today's date on, Even though, you know, I bought this, Like, 2 weeks ago. So whatever. That's weird. Ok. [gasps] Oh, gary, what a beautiful locket. That's right. You know, I saw that, It just said sasha. Oh ho ho. I love it. Thank you. Open it up. There's a picture inside. Ohh! What a cute picture of louise. Yeah. That's me, actually. I was--I was a pretty scrawny kid. Oh. Gary, it's perfect. Thank you. Hi, dad. Oh, goodness gracious. What are you guys doing here? Mom. Yeah, she told us to get in the car, And I didn't ask questions. I was afraid she was trying To stuff a twinkie in my mouth. Hey, gary. Hey, sasha. Uh, I just wanted to let everyone know That arcade night is back on. So gget your stuff. What? Yay! All right! Thank you, allison. That's great. Yeah. You know what? We were havin' such a great time At my house. I thought, you know, It's just not even fair to have the fun stop there, So have at them, you know. Let the good times roll. With antibacterial hand spray. Rit there. Great. Well, we should probably get going So the kids have more time to play before they close. Yeah, I'll go put the champagne in the fridge. Aw, yeah. You know, I, uh- I need to sit down a second. Are you ok?Yeah. I just, uh... I think I poisoned myself with processed mts And preservative-laced dairy, but--[gasps] I'm gonna be fine once I puke. Yeah. It's gonna be good. Wh-- Wow. That's, um-- hmm? That's a really interesting locket. Oh, this? Ah, yeah. Gary actually gave this to me. Yeah. A locket was always his "get out of the ghouse" gift. Yeah. As--as I recall, I think he gave this to me When he went out drinking for oktoberfest. He didn't come home till November. Mmm. His "get out of the doghouse gift," huh? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So if you ever get in a fight with him Or if he screws up, you can always count On a piece of jewelry comin' your way. Yeah. Seems like a pretty safe bet. We're ready. We're ready. Ok, kids. Let's go. All right, allison. Well, see you later. Tell gary I love my locket as much as I love yours. What? Aren't you gonna wait for gary? Oh, crap. Where's, uh-- where's sasha? Uh, she left for the arcade with the kids. Without saying good-bye? That's a little bizarre, don't you think? Yeah. Yeah, I think she's a little mad. Ah, I don't think so,not after . Allison, is that-- mine. And you decided to-- yeah. Am I-- oh, so much. Gaah! Why would you wear it here, now? How was I supposed to know? I don't have a crystal ball of stupidity. The only one I know of is attached to your neck. I gotta go get her. Sasha! Oh, man, I hope it's not too late. It's too late. She's gone. That's great. The locket was supposed to be The gift to make everything better. Now erything's a million times worse. Why is it so hard to find the perfect gift? Gary, it's because of the way you buy a gift. You always have an agenda-- Lowering someone's expectations, Getting someone to forgive you, Getting someone to have sex with you. That's what gifts are for. Ok, gary, Sten to me. You don't give someone a gift to get something in return. You give them a gift to show them how you feel about them. What? When did this start? Ok, Why don't yo have it start tonight? You're right. I gotta get to the arcade. To tell her... To tell her what? Why won't anybody finish a sentence? Quit cutting me off. Ah, women drivers. Women drivers? Your character's a girl. I like what she's wearing. Oh. There's sasha. Go talk to her. Yeah, I don't thinso. She's holding a mallet. Gary, you'll be fine. That's what you said at the grand canyon When you kept telling me to back up to get my picture taken. So you, uh-- you have the thing? Yeah, I got the thing. All rit, well, go. Hi. Oh. Hi. Bet you're pretty mad, huh? Yeah, little bit. Well, all I have to say to that is bo-oi-oing. Bu-whup. I got you again. Because the locket-- Why am I even doing this? It barely worked that one time. I'm sorry. I got you those wristbands, And I just freaked out, and I tried to fix it the only way I know how. I'm sorry, ok? And I just freaked out, gary, I'm not so much madx it as I am embarrassed, ok?Now how. Because the difference in our gifts clearly show That you don't feel the same way about me As I feel about you, and that's fine. I mean, we haven't-- Sa-sasha, I didn't want to go too far too fast with the first gift, So I was gonna set the bar low. I could have set it a lot lower. You don't know how close you came To getting an e-card with a singing and dancing pickle, ok? Look, gary, let's-- let's just forget the whole thing, ok? Let's forget valentine's day ever happened. I won't even say, "valentine's day." From now on, I'm just gonna say, "v.D." ok? Ok. You know what's great about v.D.? Is that it brought you and I closer together. Uh, I got somethin' for you. Uh, actually, why don't you put down the mallet in case you don't like it. You know that machine, you put $5.00 in it, And they give you a penny with a message on it? "I butt you"? Yeah. The heart came out upside down, But that's how I feel, so... This is a perfect gift. And just for the record, I butt you, too. [laughs] There you guys are. How you doing, allison? You vin' fun? Yeah, I'm tryin'. Look at me eatin' a hot dog, huh? Ah-choo. Uh. I was eating a hot dog. Here. Hey, the-- the mechanical bull is 18 and over. One of you's gotta try it. Not me, little man. Once I tried a mechanical bull, I had to sit on fron peas for a week. Mom? What? A mechanical bull, and get thrown And spun around in every direction. Ah... Sasha? No way. I can never stay on those things. It's way too hard. Show me the bull. I can take it easy on you if you like. What, are you kidding? Kids are over there watchin'. There you go. Tom: All right. Good luck, mom. Yeah. L right. Ohh! Louise: Go, mom! Tom: All right! All right, allison. Whoo! Go, mom! Allison, watch out! Your shirt!
