'Cause I saw him in the mess hall. - You're all right? - Yeah. You just seem a little confused. Are you ill? No, I just... I... don't... Where am I? You're in one of our auxiliary labs. East pier, level four? Here, why don't you sit down? - It's okay... - No, really. I'll radio Rodney... No, no, you don't need to do that. Better yet, let... Why don't you lie down? Walk with me to the infirmary, and they'll examine you, They'll just see if there's anything... Saison 5 Ã‰pisode 18 Identity (v. 1.00) The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams I've been looking for you. Is your radio not working? I called, like, 1,000 times! Come on. Here. I just want to check your earwig. Here we go. It was probably just a dead battery. Come on, it's schnitzel day. We've got to hurry, it's going fast. - So what happened? - What do you mean? Our lunch date? You were supposed to meet me. I must have forgotten. What's wrong? You seem distracted. Is something bothering you? Did I do something? I did, didn't I? What'd I do? - Nothing. I'm just... I'm not... - <i>Dr. Keller?</i> Dr. Keller! Please respond. Just a second. It's for you. Working fine, apparently. Dr. Keller, we have an emergency. Dr. Zelenka has been seriously injured!</i> What's wrong with Zelenka? It's about his so-called migraines? - If it is, you can just send him... - <i>He's been stabbed!</i> What? Stabbed? Like, with a knife, stabbed? By whom? I don't know, they found him on the floor of his lab.</i> He's unconscious, losing a lot of blood. They're rushing him to the infirmary.</i> All right, we're on our way. His pressure's dropping. 60 over 40. Pulse rapid, skin diaphoretic. The scan shows internal bleeding, laceration of the liver. Is he going to die? He needs immediate surgery. He's in hypovolemic shock. - Doctor? - Yes, he needs surgery. We're prepping the OR. Dr. Mcbride will assist you. We'll be set to go as soon as you're ready. - You're acting weird. What's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing. I need to get ready. Doctor? I'm not feeling very well. Take over for me. I'm going to go lie down. - How'd it go? - He's lost a lot of blood. - Is he awake yet? - No. He's in a coma. It's a light coma. They figure he should recover, barring any complications. I hear Dr. Keller didn't perform the surgery? No. No, she... excused herself. She said she wasn't feeling well. - What's wrong with her? - She's been acting strange. Aloof, distracted. I found her wandering, looking lost. I got her to the infirmary, but she stood there - like she'd never held a scalpel. - Where is she now? In her quarters, resting. Dr. Beckett is due back soon. I'll have him examine her for any possible contagion, or, God forbid, another one of those parasitic organisms. Better safe than sorry. Any leads yet as to who might have done this? - No witnesses, no sign of struggle. - I want a full investigation. Use every resource, no stone unturned. - One of our people is lying in a coma. - Light coma. And I want to know who's responsible. What the hell's going on here? - Heard you weren't feeling well. - No. - Can I come in? - All right. So. What's wrong with you? I don't know. I'm just... tired. Been pushing yourself real hard lately. Well, you know me. I'm always pushing myself real hard. What? Nothing. Anyway, I'll be fine. - I just need some... - Hi. - Am I... interrupting? - No. Good. I mean... I just dropped by to let you know that Beckett is on his way back. He'll be able to fill in for you while you're... - ill. - Great. Yeah, we've sent a Puddle Jumper for him. A Puddle Jumper? Well, he's in some remote desert village, and it'll take too long to walk back, so, it's easier to hitch a ride. A ride on a Puddle Jumper. Maybe we should leave, you know, let her get some rest. Call me... if you need anything. I will. Nothing out of the usual, no sign of trauma or any kind of organism. What about her blood work? The same. How long have you been feeling like this? A day or so? - Have you been sleeping all right? - No. I've been pushing myself real hard. Aye. Well, I'd like to keep you overnight for observation. I'll give you something for sleeping, and we'll monitor your condition. Hopefully, you'll wake up refreshed, back to your old self. Okay? You're certain you saw nothing at all? She's fine... Physically speaking. If there's something wrong, I'm afraid it's most likely psychological in nature. Hello... All these corridors, I keep getting turned around. The puddle Jumper is... where? The Jumper bay? Top of the central tower. Right. Yeah, I know that. I just need to... How do I...? The transporter's in the corridor. It'll take you there. Transporter. Of course. Thank you. You're welcome. Perfect. Come on, come on. What are you doing? I... couldn't sleep. What, so you came up to the Jumper bay? Yeah... I thought I'd go for a ride. - In a puddle Jumper? - Is there a problem with that? A few. You don't have the Ancient gene, so you can't fly one. - But you already know that. - Can you fly it? Of course, but you should be back in the infirmary. But you could take me for a ride. What, now? It would really help me relax. I thought Beckett gave you pills for that? They didn't work. Come on. Please? Just you and me. Alone... You could take me somewhere secluded. We can... We could make love... underneath the stars. Really? - Would you like that? - Well... Yeah! I'd have to get a blanket, though, because the mainland's groundcover - is loaded with allergens. - No. Let's just go now. Wait. No, no. You should go back to the infirmary. Forget about the infirmary. - I need to be with you. - Jennifer, please. Come on. Just a quick ride. - Don't you want to be with me? - No. I just... Yes! I just... Will you stop? Look, you are clearly not yourself. I'm taking you back to the infirmary... I'm not letting you... You're not taking me anywhere. I need you to listen to me. As soon as you are cured of whatever it is that is affecting you, you're going to thank me for this, so... Let's go. No! Don't you... - What're you doing? - You should've taken me on that ride. I don't care what the scans say... Either she's suffered a serious mind-altering brain trauma, or some kind of entity has taken control of her. Has she been injured recently? Not that I know of. I mean, she was perfectly fine up until yesterday. her brain scan would have revealed any kind of physical trauma, as well as any foreign organism. - Unless the organism's good at hiding. - Yeah. Wouldn't be the first time. It took days to figure out rodney was infected. I don't think we should rule out the possibility of a psychological event. We sometimes forget that working in this environment, in a whole other galaxy, can be emotionally overwhelming. Such acute stress has often been linked to various dissociative disorders. Disorder? She tried to kill me. I don't think she would have pulled the trigger. Hey, I saw the look in her eyes. Wait a second. If she had something to do with Zelenka? What if she's the one who stabbed him? That woman down there is not Jennifer Keller. I think Woolsey's right. Something has taken control of her. - How can we be sure of this? - Well, we can start by asking her. Let's make this simple. Who the hell are you? - What? - If you are, in fact, Jennifer Keller, you would know what town you're from, what your father's name is. So go ahead, tell us. All right, look... I know I've been acting strange... Strange? Dr. Keller wouldn't point a gun at me. And she certainly wouldn't stab Zelenka. Well? You did it, didn't you? You stabbed him. It was self-defense. I didn't want to hurt anybody, but he attacked me. - Zelenka attacked you? - He couldn't harm a fly. He tried to grab me. I thought he was gonna turn me in. - I was afraid of being caught. - The fact is, you have been caught. So I would advise you to tell us exactly who... or what you are. My name is Neeva Casol. I have no idea what I'm doing here, or how I came to be in this person's body. In her body? One moment I was myself, searching through some artifacts in a village, the next moment, I'm stuck in some strange woman's body, standing in the middle of this city. Every time I look at my reflection, I see her... staring back at me. How is that even possible? I wish I knew. What artifacts? Me and my associates, we travel around, planet to planet, searching for valuables to acquire. Oh, you mean "steal". We heard about a planet that supposedly held a trove of ancestral artifacts... So we made our way there and broke into the vault... Yeah... Yeah, yeah. You see? I told you. There is all kinds of treasure in here. Okay, well, move fast. Take only what we can carry. What... is that? I don't know. But it's too big to haul out of here. I have no idea how this happened, or why. Oh, believe me, I'm just as confused by it as you are... But I am telling you the truth. Look, I'm sorry for hurting one of your people, but I felt threatened, and I only know of one way to deal with a threat. I don't want to hurt anybody else. I just want to get back into my own body. - What have you got? - I've figured out what happened. The artifact that woman described it rang a bell, so I did a little research. Turns out, a few years ago, SG-1 encountered a similar device in the Glastonbury cavern. - The Ancient communication terminal? - Exactly. Of course. The stones, the psychic link... What terminal? What stones? Okay, look, SG-1 discovered an Ancient device. These stones... if you place them in one of several recesses around the device, it activates it, and allows you to connect to someone far... far away, across the galaxy, intergalactically, even, as with Daniel Jackson and Vala. So this woman activated one of these devices? I think so, yes. - Why'd she connect with Keller? - Ah, my first question as well. Then I remembered Janus's lab... We have recovered tons of Ancient technology from there. We're still cataloguing it all. Anyways, a few weeks ago, Jennifer visited me while I was working there. Rodney, if we don't leave soon, we're not going to get a good seat. - Yeah. Almost... Almost there. - Come on, it's <i>Dr. No</i>! The first Bond movie. You don't want to get stuck sitting behind Ronon again, like last week. I know, I know, I know. Not to mention, all the popcorn's gonna be gone. God! This is amazing! These are the initial design concepts for a personal cloaking device. Janus never got around to making it but, given enough time, I might be able... We haven't cataloged those yet! - Sorry. - What did we say about that? These stones must somehow be connected to the Ancient terminal that Neeva found. But how could Jennifer activate one of these stones? He's right, it's Ancient technology. Don't you need to have the ATA gene? It must've been initialized already. Maybe Janus did it, or maybe a tech initialized it after we discovered the lab. Look, the point is that Jennifer was obviously the last person to touch this, which is why it connected to her. If I remember the case report correctly, disconnecting the device proved difficult. Yes. I've been going over the SGC files on that, and there's still a lot of unanswered questions about how it works. Hold on. If this woman's mind is in Keller's body, does that mean Keller's mind is in her body? I don't know. Maybe. I mean... probably. Then the question is... where is Dr. Keller? What happened? Did you contact Atlantis? No. Why not? I chose to first contact a few of my trading partners on other planets. It appears you and your accomplices have made quite the name for yourselves. I already told you, I am not who you think I am... I suppose I should feel fortunate. I mean, your crimes elsewhere far exceed the mere robbery charges you've been accused of here. I've counted no less than five murders committed on other planets by your hand alone. Sseveral more with the aid of your two accomplices. They may have eluded capture so far, but mark my words, we will find them. Listen to me. My name is Dr. Jennifer Keller. I am the chief medical officer from Atlantis. I don't know what's going on, or how my mind ended up in this woman's body, but if you contact them, ask for Dr. Rodney McKay... You are also said to be a highly effective liar, willing to fabricate any story, broker any kind of deal, to get yourself free. Rest assured, I will not fall for your tricks. As magistrate of this village, I hereby pronounce sentence upon you for the crimes you've committed, not only on this planet, but on all the other planets in the coalition. Tomorrow, you shall be taken from this cell and executed. - What are the options? - There's only one option. We have to go to the planet, find the terminal, and shut it off. It was activated on that end. It's the initial transmitter. To sever the connection, we shut it down at the source. And have you figured out how to safely do that? No, not yet. We're not going to know until we get a look at this thing. Well, the sooner, the better. I've been studying the SG-1 report. This device connects beyond merely the psychological. There's also a physiological connection as well. What does that mean? It means, should Neeva's body be killed, Jennifer's mind would perish along with her. And we'll be stuck with... this other woman in Keller's body? We need to get moving. Agreed. Do we know which planet this device is on? - We will. - I can take you to the planet. I'll lead you straight to the device... on one condition. - You're in no position to make... - What is it? When you sever that connection, you have to agree not to pursue me or my accomplices. Fine. And you give me a Puddle Jumper. What? Forget it! I know how many you have. You have more than enough. - You're not getting anything. - Weapons, then. You take us there, we don't pursue you. That's it. Take it or leave it. All right, all right. Let's go. Which way? This way. It's not far. A few hours' walk. A few hours? You could have told us that before! Wouldn't have made any difference. Couldn't get a Jumper into this forest. And the Daedalus is back on Earth. Yeah, but I could've packed some extra power bars, some water, not to mention proper insoles. - He complains a lot. - Only when he's awake. Is it true that Dr. Keller and he are... Hard to believe, huh? Yeah, keep walkin'. It's time. That's it. The vault is near the center of the village, we'll have to be quiet. Maybe only a few of us should go in. I'll need a weapon, in case we run into... No. We're not breaking into the room. What? We're going to go talk to these people And ask them for help. Oh, they're not going to help us. I tried to rob them. They won't know you. You're in Jennifer Keller's body, remember? If you do not say anything, it should not be a problem. Okay, but what if they've captured her... me? Once we sever the connection, what's to stop them from keeping me locked up? - Nothing. - Ahh. Nothing. You said we couldn't pursue you. Didn't say anything about them. - So you tricked me. - Hey, just take it easy. I won't let you disarm this device without first knowing where my body is. You don't have a choice. We're wasting valuable time here, people. Maybe she should stay here. No. I'll go. - Ronon? - Yeah, I got her. Let's go. Hi. It's okay, we're friends. We're... we're from Atlantis. I'm Colonel John Sheppard. What is it you want? Well, we have a problem, and we need some help. We hear that this village holds a number of Ancient artifacts, most notably a communication terminal... about yea-big, round-ish, grooves along the outside... yes? Why do you ask about this device? - So you have it? Where is it? - It's hidden, and well-protected, so if you have any designs on removing it... No, no, no. Look. We just want to take a look at it. We think it may have become inadvertently activated, and it's... Well, it's causing some problems for us on Atlantis. Long story short, we're just gonna shut it off, and, well, we'll be on our way. We're not here to cause any trouble. We'd just like some assistance. I do not have the authority to grant such assistance. For that, you will need to speak to the village magistrate. All right. Let's talk to him. - He's not here. - Oh, for God's sake. How long? This is urgent. He will return when the execution is completed. Oh, my God! Neeva Casol... You have been found guilty of the crime of murder, and so you shall be put to death. I am not Neeva Casol! Don't worry. The executioner is strong, his blade sharp. Your death will be far less painful than those of your victims. Please... Please! Don't do this! Ambush! What? No thank-you for the rescue? Let's go. She went that way! Find her! Go back to the village, gather more men. I want that ancestral ring guarded! No one leaves this planet! We're too late. I don't believe this. How did she escape? My accomplices no doubt intervened. This is not the first time{\ we've been in this situation}. How many accomplices do you have? - Two. - That's all? More than enough. Trust me. You don't want to challenge them. Yeah? We'll see about that. Where would they have gone? I have no idea. All right, Chewie. Start trackin'. Yeah. I'm on it. You looked frightened out there. What, you didn't think we'd save you? I just... After how many times you saved our hides? We weren't gonna let you down. You all right? You look confused. No, I'm just... You know, happy to be out of there. So, what's the plan? Plan? What do we do now? I don't know. Yet. Yet... I don't know yet. I just need... more time to think. Well, think faster. Because, sooner or later, those villagers will find this cave. And I don't want to be here when they do. Right. Good point. This way. That's the third patrol in the last 10 minutes. It seems as if the entire village is out looking for her. Let's hope we find her before they do. What the hell happened? I lost her. - Are there no tracks? - There's nothing. She's good. Listen, I think the best plan of action is to leave this planet. Now, I know of another planet. We'll be safe there. They'll be guarding the ring. I know. Maybe we could create some kind of diversion? Well, how do we do that? I don't know... Maybe... Maybe we can set an explosion. And why would they run toward an explosion? Or something else. I say we wait till nightfall... then we'll launch an attack on the ring. - Catch them by surprise. - An attack? We kill the guards, activate the ring, and we make our escape. I agree. But if I think of something else before then, maybe we could... All right, don't shoot. Who are you? I'm... Neeva Casol. All right, let me explain. Back at the artifact vault, I accidentally activated some kind of ancestral communications device that caused my mind to transfer into this woman's body, and hers into mine. You expect us to believe that? Yeah, Jannik, I do. I expect you to believe that, just as you did on Vara Sol, when I brokered that deal with the merchant to save your life. And you, Bordal. If you didn't trust me back when you got caught at that brothel, those women would've made sure you won't thought of provreating again. - How do you know about that? - Because I'm Neeva. There's a link between us. Her mind is in my body, and mine is in hers. Look, whatever's happening here, I had nothing to do with it. No, she didn't. But if we're gonna fix this, we need to move fast. We need to go back to the village, break into the vault, and turn off that device. We need to be really careful, cause the villagers are looking for us, but so are the people from Atlantis. Wait a second. They're here? Who, Colonel Sheppard? Among others, but they'll turn us in to the villagers, so we need no problems from you. Do you understand me? All right, we need to find this device... Stop! I don't know what's going on here. I just told you, all right? I am Neeva. - I've never seen you before! - Jannik, listen to me. This is not the time to be stupid. I wouldn't make him angry... You're gonna put down the gun, and you're gonna listen to what I say. I'm not. I'm gonna take the both of you with me. We're going to attack the ring now. And we'll sort out who's really who on another planet. And if you're lying to me, you're as good as dead. - This Dr. McKay... - What about him? - You can do better. - Be quiet. I know this is difficult to understand... I was equally confused by it at the beginning, but you have to... - How many? - I don't know! I count four. We'd be a lot better off if you'd given us weapons. He's dead. Hey! Come back here! - Stop! - Jannik, don't! Don't! - Is she going to be all right? - Aye, for now, but I need to stop the bleeding. Here, hold her steady, Rodney. You two, give us a hand here, please. On the table, Rodney. These are the people from Atlantis I was telling you about. - What happened? - She was shot by one of your men. I warned you it was dangerous to venture out there. Is she dead? She's badly wounded. Teyla, gonna need a hand. I need to remove the bullet{\i: and stop the bleeding:i}. And we need access to that terminal. We need to shut it down right now! - Why? What's it doing? - It creates a psychic link. So Dr. Keller and this Neeva Casol have switched places. - They're in each other's bodies. - You know about Atlantis, right? Then you know you're better off being our friend than our enemy. So why don't you be our friend and show us where that terminal is? This way. It's still on! Obviously. So turn it off. Well, there's no switches. But it looks almost identical to the one SG-1 found. There's the bullet... Now to stem the bleeding. I don't know who you are... But you are definitely not Neeva. No, I'm not. But I'm not your enemy, either, and if you'd just let me, I think I can help... You're not helping anyone. - Come on! Hurry up! - Believe me, I'm trying! There's no way to access crystal. There is no way to shut this thing off! All right. What if... What if we blow it up? I don't know. I mean, maybe. I'm just not sure if the explosion could cause a sudden power surge... What the other guys did? SG-1 dialed the Gate and tossed the device into the vortex... Disintegrated instantly. But it's too far to carry back to the Gate. You got Bordal killed. And you've almost got me killed. I'm gonna return the favor. We may not have much of a choice, so give me a hand with this. - I'm not sure we've got the time... - Hold up. Move! - You're back? - I'm back. You've been shot, love. Don't worry, we removed the bullet. You'll be just fine. Wait, Jannik. It's me, Neeva. They must've turned off the device. Nice try. I appreciate that, Dana. Say hello for me. What's the occasion? Just visiting a friend in the infirmary. - That's very thoughtful of you, Rodney. - I know. Major Lorne and his team just returned. They did a full sweep of the planet. No sign of Neeva Casol. She must've managed to escape. I don't know about that. According to Jennifer, her accomplice was about to kill her when we shut down the terminal. Either he did kill her and disposed of the body before escaping himself, or she got away from him somehow. - Well, I guess we'll never know. - Well, we may. Word has gone out to several planets in the coalition. If Neeva is alive and roaming free, she won't be for long. - You'll promise you'll take it easy? - Yes, Doctor. Don't worry. I'll make sure of it. - Hey you. - Hey you. Oh, thank you, Rodney. Flowers and chocolates? I'm impressed. Right. Enough. She's alone in the infirmary. I thought I would, brighten the room up a bit. How you doing? Better. Thanks. Again, Radek, I am so sorry for what happened. It's not your fault. I told you, don't worry. I'm fine. Yeah, yeah, of course he's fine. He's perky, ready to go back to work. - I don't know about that... - He needs to get rest, too, Rodney. I agree. His wound was much more serious than mine. Really? I mean, you were shot. He was just... stabbed. Perhaps I should wheel you to another room? Just until he's gone, please. Thank you. Aye. Right. I completely agree. - Chocolates? - Thank you. So... I was thinking that... when you're feeling better, we could maybe... you know, go for a ride. - A ride? - Yeah, take the puddle Jumper, go to the mainland, maybe have a picnic, maybe lie out under the stars? What? You did turn off that communication terminal, right? There's no one else in there? No, it's really me. 'Cause a puddle Jumper ride and the picnic under the stars... - I mean, that's just so...
