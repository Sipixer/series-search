Intergalactic Gate Bridge.</i> 34 Gates from both the Milky Way and Pegasus Gate systems have been strategically placed in the massive void between our two galaxies. A macro that I have written specially for the occasion</i> will command each Gate in the chain to store you in its buffer and forward you along to the next... and the next and the next... until you arrive here. Once at the Midway Space Station, you simply exit the Pegasus Gate system</i> and enter the Milky Way Gate system, where</i> a similar macro designed by yours truly</i> will forward you along to the SGC. The program is completely secure. No need for a shield or an iris. Total travel time... a little over 30 minutes. You applause. Welcome back, Teyla. Thank you. Believe me, it's good to be back.</i> So, what's new on Earth? I wouldn't know. I saw nothing beyond the walls of Stargate Command for two days.</i> - How'd the interview go? - Exactly as you said it would. The new member of the IOA, Mr. Coolidge, was somewhat brusque and arrogant. He insisted on doing most of the questioning himself. I thought he would. These interviews were the first item on his agenda. Don't worry, just a new guy marking his territory. Yes, well, he is clearly distrustful of aliens participating in any aspect of the Sargate Program, let alone being active team members. You changed his mind, right? I hope so. Although he did seem distracted - by my current condition. - Really?</i> - I informed the IOA of your pregnancy. - Yes, they knew,</i> and most of the members were actually quite supportive. But Mr. Coolidge... His demeanor toward women differs from his demeanor toward men. He kept calling me "Honey". I admit, the urge to inflict harm on this man was quite strong, but - I managed to refrain from doing so. - Good call. Bad idea to run around beating the crap out of people with a baby on the way. In the end, I don't think he will have a problem with me, mainly because I think he believes I will not be returning to active duty after my child is born. Won't he be surprised? Well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. In the meantime, it's important that we get through these interviews</i> as smoothly as possible and not create any waves. I'll inform you when the report comes in. Thank you. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Ronon's up next. - Big waves. We're talking tsunamis. I've thought about that. His interview's not for three days, so I've asked somebody to come to Atlantis and... "coach" him. Who? Teal'c. Colonel Carter. Welcome to Atlantis. The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams present: Season 4 Episode 17 Midway (v. 1.00) Transcription by: swsub.com Timing by: Golgi, IceFre@k, Linwelin, Pikes, Shaft. So, Teal'c, the... hair... - You do not like it? - No, I love it. It's very... Earth. This city is much larger than I had expected. It's a remarkable feat of engineering. The Ancients really knew what they were doing. Indeed. You look well, Colonel Carter. - Command has been good to you. - Thanks, Teal'c. It takes some getting used to. The military protocol's pretty relaxed, but I like it here. Is that him? Yep. That's him. Come on. Ronon Dex, I'd like you to meet Teal'c of the Jaffa. He's the one I was telling you about. It is a pleasure to meet you, Ronon Dex. Colonel Carter has spoken highly of you. Anyway... Like I said, you two are similar in many ways, so you should have a lot in common. Teal'c was a member of SG-1 for over 10 years. He knows all about dealing with the IOA. Which is why I thought he could pass along a few pointers, help you prep for the big interview. Colonel Carter? Yeah? Perhaps you could leave us to become better acquainted. Sure. Have fun. Do you not speak, Ronon Dex? Not when I've got nothing to say. This is it. Get to work. May I join you? Salisbury steak. We are often served this in the SGC mess hall. I must confess, however, that I am partial to the tater tots... I don't need a coach teaching me how to act during the interview. I've dealt with the IOA before. The IOA is comprised of more than just Mr. Woolsey. Their new member, Mr. Coolidge, is far less pleasant. Oh, well, I can handle him. I'll stay calm, answer all his questions. I know how to play the game. I am pleased to hear that. Very well. Let us speak of other things. Such as? Tell me of Sateda. What do you want to know? When did the Wraith destroy it? Years ago. Your army was unable to fight? Oh, we fought back. The battle lasted days. And when you finally surrendered, - What did the Wraith do... - We didn't surrender.</i> We fought until every last one of us was either dead or captured. So tell me, then... Is it true that negligence on your part is what first alerted the Wraith to your presence? That your reckless actions brought about the deaths of thousands of innocent people... That's a lie! Indeed it is. Yet should such a question arise during your interview,</i> I trust you will not respond in a similar manner. You do, after all, know how to play the game. Ronon! Put... the gun... away. What's the problem here? There is no problem, Colonel Sheppard. Well, that's good to hear. Ronon? All right... Why don't you take Teal'c down to the gym, show him your fighting techniques? I'm sure you guys could give each other a few tips.</i> Colonel, come to place a bet? - What's going on here? - Friendly sparring match. It looks anything but friendly. No, it's good for 'em. They're just blowing off some steam. Go! Go! Go! - How long have they been at it? - About an hour. An hour? They're not even taking any breaks. They are now! I don't think that's a good idea... Okay, that's enough! Ronon! Teal'c! Stop! Let's call it a draw. Why does he have to go with me? He's not actually going with you. He's returning home. He just happens to be traveling at the same time. One less dial-in on the intergalactic bridge. That's the other thing. Why don't we just dial Earth directly from here? We need a ZPM for that, and we don't want to waste the extra power. That was the whole point of the Gate bridge in the first place. But there's a 24-hour quarantine on the Midway station. Well, you're just going to have to sit around a bit, all right? Look. The guy's got years of experience. He's, like, 100 years old or something. It won't kill you to listen to him. Be a good boy. I hate you. I'm sorry about breaking up the sparring match earlier, but if I didn't, you two would probably still be fighting. Listen, I know that Ronon's been resistant, but I really appreciate you coming here and helping us out. I too wish him to succeed. - There is great potential in him. - I agree. All set? Let's get this over with. - Dial the bridge, Chuck. - Yes, Ma'am.</i> It gives me great pride to see how the people of this expedition have embraced you as their leader. As I knew they would. Thanks, Teal'c. The Portal's activating! The patterns are stored in the buffer. The Portal should re-dial momentarily. Incoming Pegasus activation. Right on schedule. I'm going to go get them settled in. You can get started on the attitude stabilization diagnostics. I thought Dempster was doing that. - Why do I have to do that? - You don't. - I want you to do it. - I just finished five hours - of power-distribution upgrades. - You chose to be here. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. Regardless, I want you to learn everything about this station, and the sooner you do that, the sooner I get to hand you the reins and go home. You're not the only one who wants to go home. I heard that. Gentlemen! Welcome to the Midway station, half-way point between the Pegasus and Milky Way galaxies. Yeah, we know. We've been here before. Of course. So then you also know about the 24-hour quarantine before we can let you carry on to Earth? Don't want to pass on any of those pesky Pegasus germs to the folks back home. Why don't I just show you to your quarters? Unfortunately, you're going to have to share. As you know, there's not much room on the station. There's a DVD player and a few movies. Oh! We sawn Orbit the other day. It's actually... It's kind of funny. There's some sudoku books... Although I think... No, they're all solved. Like I said, it's a bit small, but... You're only here for a day, so kick back, relax, have an earl grey, and get to know each other better, or... not. I have deciphered the program. Prepare the first wave! How's it going? Peachy. You're bored. I get it. Welcome to Midway. - Are we expecting another dial-in? - No. Unscheduled Pegasus activation. - What the heck? - Oh, God! Wraith! That's impossible! What are the Wraith doing here? I was about to ask the same question. Stop! Dial Earth. What's going on? The intergalactic bridge is down. - How'd that happen? - I don't know. We were sending the daily status report to the SGC, and we can't connect to Midway. Some kind of malfunction either in one of the Gates</i> or the call-forwarding macro. Probably just a glitch. Simple software hiccup. - Hiccup? - We hope. Ronon and Teal'c? The malfunction occurred several minutes after they went through. I'm sure they made it to Midway. - But we can't be absolutely certain. - Those Gates are in space.</i> - If they walked through... - No, no.</i> Look, the glitch occurred at M4F-788, that is a planetary Gate at the edge of the Pegasus galaxy, which means worst-case scenario, they step through the puddle and they found themselves stranded on an uninhabited planet. Stranded. More time together. Just what they need. All right, we need to secure the Gate room. No. We must get to the control room. More Wraith can get through the Gate. They cannot use the Stargate without the control room. It is best if we just keep... This way. What's wrong? I cannot activate the Portal. A lockout command has been initiated. It's preventing me from accessing the controls. Override it. I'm trying... It requires a code. What is the code? We don't know. Honestly. We don't know. There's only a handful of people who know that specific code, for obvious security reasons, and... None are on the base right now. You initiated the lockout? Well, it's not really a matter of who initiated it. - It's standard protocol... - Did you? But, I mean, yeah it was me, but... like I said, initiating it and overriding it are two entirely separate... Silence! Keep working. Find a way around it. It will take time. - The interface has several... - The more you speak the less time you have. In the meantime, perhaps I can find a way to persuade you to give me that code. We've got a lock. Finally. Yeah, seems someone dialing out from 788, which was preventing us from dialing in, until now. - Ronon and Teal'c? - Oh, I doubt it. Look, even if the malfunction spat them out on the planet, the only logical address they would dial is back to Atlantis, which as we know, they didn't. Maybe it's them and they can't get a lock. Ronon, Teal'c. Are you there? Ronon, Teal'c, this is Colonel Carter. Please respond. I'm telling you, they made it to the Midway station before the malfunction. I'm sure of it. Wait a minute. - Didn't you say 788 is uninhabited? - It is. All right, if it's not Ronon and Teal'c, then who dialed out? The malp is through. Receiving telemetry. Visual coming in now. See? No Ronon, no Teal'c. Pan left. That's Wraith tech. It's hooked up to the DHD. Pan right. Oh, crap. We lost the feed. Not to mention the malp. Shut down the Gate. Is it possible for them to have hijacked the intergalactic bridge? That's a hell of a lot more than a hiccup. No impossible. They'd have to know about the bridge, And if they did, there're too many security barriers. The encryption I used in the call forwarding macros would take years to... - What if they knew the passwords? - How? We just had a Wraith on base, Rodney, working with you, side by side, on your computers. You mean Todd? He was our ally. Look, and even if he wanted to, there's no way he could hack into my system... - Could he? - You saw the tech hooked up</i> to the DHD. What else could they be up to? We have to get to Midway. The daedalus's back on Earth. Is there another way to get there? Connect to the bridge via another Gate in Pegasus? We have to find one close to the edge. M6R-125. We could connect to the bridge through that but, - I'd need to reconfigure the macros. - OK, get on it.</i> Colonel, prepare a strike force. Honestly, if I knew the code, I would have given it to you by now. That depends on the strength of your allegiance. No, no, trust me! My allegiance is not that strong. It really isn't. Please. Please! I'm begging you!</i> I think he fainted. Then you shall be next. - Wait... - I've got it. I've successfully gained access to override the lockout. Good. Dial the Portal. In here. They're heading to the Gate room. Indeed. If you want to go to the control room, go ahead... I'm going after them. Ronon! Send the device. Device? What device? Offworld activation! Midway's IDC. Opening the iris. All right, we're redirected. We gate from Atlantis to M6R-125. We insert this crystal with the bridge macros into the DHD, dial the first Gate in the void, and we're back on track, all the way to Midway. - Is your strike force ready? - As soon as McKay gears up, - we're ready to go. - Well, I'm... All right, I'm gearing up. Prepare the next wave. They have dialed the Milky Way Gate. They're heading for Stargate Command. We must pursue them. Now you're talking. Let's go before the Gate shuts down! Shut it down! Now! Two were able to pass through. But they will be dispensed of soon enough. - Make ready the next... - The Pegasus Portal is activating!</i> The next inbound wave was supposed to wait for my command. Teams 3 and 4, take the lower level. Teams 1 and 2 with me, this way. Yeah, they're alive, they're just stunned. By this device, perhaps. I don't know. Never seen one of these before. It appears other personnel have been disabled as well. The question is how much of this base has been compromised? And where the hell are the Wraith? Ronon, Teal'c, come in! Ronon, do you copy? Shut the door. Clear. Colonel Sheppard. Sheppard! You have no chance of retaking this station.</i> Therefore, it is in your best interests</i> to surrender immediately. Do I know you? Not personally, no. But I know a great deal about you. - You as well, Dr. McKay. - Who are you?</i> An acquaintance of someone you recently worked with to bring about the demise of those you referred to as "Replicators." It was from him that I was able to procure the necessary data to commandeer this base. It was Todd. That bastard hacked my system. So much for buddies. So... what's the plan? Take over Midway, and then what? Earth? My warriors are securing a beachhead in your command center as we speak. Hate to break this to you, but the SGC is heavily fortified. You're walking into a world of hurt. Not to worry. We have ways of evening the odds. Look, they're working their way to the surface, tryin' to get out. They will be unable to do so. A pulse of energy, no doubt from that Wraith device... has triggered the SGC automatic lockdown. So no one gets in, and no one gets out? Indeed. Just the way I like it. We have activation. That will be our reinforcements. Soon, it is you who will be in for a world of hurt. Oh, crap. Listen, love to sit around and chat, but... gotta go.</i> Take positions. Anything comes through the Gate, - kill it. - Yes, Sir. - You two, with me. - Where're we going? To the control room, to shut down the Gate. Oh, thank God. - Where's the head guy? - He left.</i> Well, I can see that. Where'd he go? I don't know. He just ran out. McKay, we're in the clear! Get to work! Where's Ronon and Teal'c? They went through the Milky Way Gate on the way to the SGC, - chasing after the Wraith. - All right. Here. - What am I... - Get them inside. Seal the door, shoot anything that tries to get through. - Where are you going? - To go help those marines. - Is he dead? - Fainted. - Figures. - You better wake him up.</i> - We got a problem. - What?</i> Can't shut the Stargate. I saw them inputting a lockout protocol just before you guys came in. Damn it! More Wraith coming through the Gate. We're about to get overrun. Hester, come in, what's your 20? We're still outside the Gate room. We got a ton of Wraith coming through.</i> - Where are the other teams? - I lost contact with them.</i> I don't know how much longer we can hold 'em off here, Sir.</i> Just hang on, McKay's trying to shut down the Gate. Hester? Hester! Come in! Fed on by the Wraith. That's not a good way to go. Indeed. You say that a lot. - What? - "Indeed." Do I? I had not noticed. I would very much like to have a weapon such as this. Yeah? Get in line. Rodney, talk to me. Still working. I lost contact with Hester and the Marines.</i> I think they were killed. How long before you can get the Gate shut down? I don't know, this is extremely complicated... Try the critical systems bypass. I have to figure out how to avoid any commands that may have been compromised. Hurry up! We got more Wraith on the way. I'm working as fast as I can! - You can bypass the critical systems. - Not now. Just watch the door. Besides, even if I could shut down the Gate, there's Wraith in all the base! We're completely outnumbered. It's just a matter of time</i> before they wipe us all out... The Gate just shut off. What'd you do? I shut it off, using the critical systems bypass. Are you out of your mind? What? It worked. Oh, my God. The self-destruct. Did you not just hear me say I needed to figure out a safe work-around</i> to avoid any commands that may have been compromised? As in booby-trapped? Look, I didn't use the bypass to shut down the Gate for this very reason! - Rodney? - We've made a terrible mistake!</i> We never should've revived Kavanagh! He triggered the self-destruct? - Not on purpose! - That doesn't really matter now. All right, we've got just under 10 minutes before this whole station blows up. - Can you turn it off? - No, we're completely locked out!</i> They made sure if they couldn't have the station, then no one could.</i> This couldn't get any worse. They're shooting at the door. Wait. Are you all right? Ronon Dex, this is Mr. Coolidge of the IOA. What happened? You were rendered unconscious by a Wraith stun device. What? There are Wraith... Here? They have infiltrated the base. It is best if you remain in this room until Ronon Dex and I have neutralized the situation. No, we need to get to the control room, radio for help. We don't need help. How many Wraith are here? We do not know exact numbers, but there are many. And who else besides you are going after them? We are the only two. - Get me to a radio. Now! - It's better if we... I've got an idea, Rodney. Great, we've got Wraith about to blast through the door. This place has got a Jumper docked here, right? Yeah, to be used as an emergency escape pod. Well, I'd say this pretty much qualifies as an emergency. No... We'll be stuck out here in the middle of the galactic void. They'll mount a rescue. The Jumper is stocked with food and water. Unless you want to stay here, get blown to smithereens with the rest of the station. Your call! We got one other problem. How are we gonna get there? Rodney. We're out of time.</i> - Vent the atmosphere. - What?</i> Every room but the control room. Vent the air.</i> How close are you? Just do it. - Can you make it to the Jumper? - Don't know. I'll try!</i> - John, I'm not sure there's time to... - We don't have time to argue! Do it!</i> Venting the atmosphere. All right, I'll go this way. You go that way. Where is Mr. Coolidge? I don't know. It's pretty quiet out there. Looks like they're all dead. Sheppard, can you hear me? John, are you there? It should be enough time. I think it's safe to repressurize. Dr. McKay? Repressurizing the station. - What you doing? - I've contacted the military. They're fully aware of the situation, which means, unfortunately, - they're preparing to nuke the base. - What? Stargate Command has been compromised. Only way to prevent the Wraith from infiltrating the population is to destroy it. - Tell them to call it off. - I can't do that. Not as long as a single Wraith is still alive on this base. - Wraith? What, here? - Listen, we'll deal with the Wraith. You've got people alive here. Buy us some more time. We don't have time. There's an escape to the surface. We need to get to it immediately. Where's Teal'c? I need to get back to him. - No time! We have to leave. - Not without Teal'c. We can't go back for him. We could get bogged down or killed! There's a clear path to the escape, and we need to get out of here now! You wanna run away and save yourself? Fine! I'm stayin' here. - The Jumper bay is... - Through the EVA prep room. It's not a real bay, though. It's more like an airlock - that leads to a hatch that's... - I don't need the blueprints! - Where is it? - It's over there. Through here. Sheppard! - How the hell did you... - Get me outta here. Excellent timing. Indeed. Well, I think that's all of them. I certainly hope you are correct. We gotta call the military. They're gonna blow this place up. What's taking him so long? Self-destruct's about to blow. 20 seconds! - Colonel Sheppard! How did you... - Later. We're leaving. Sit down! Ronon Dex... Do you feel that you can fulfill the duties of an SG team member with diligence, integrity... and respect for those in authority over you? Yes. Good enough for me. Well? I'm exactly the kind of team member they want out there fighting the Wraith. Their words, not mine. And you did not hold a weapon to their heads? I did not. I am pleased. Yeah, well, I had a good coach. Indeed. The Daedalus is preparing to leave. Colonel Caldwell will beam you aboard when you are ready. Still nothing from Midway? No. We have lost all contact with them. The Daedalus will stop on its way back to Atlantis to assess the situation. No way. You actually liked it? It's his finest film. Pearl Harbor? Go ahead and mock it... Everybody does. But that film will endure, got weight. Yeah, which is why it plummeted at the box office! $200 million domestic. - That's not plummeting... - Enough, already! We've been stuck here for God knows how long, and you haven't shut up, either of you! You just keep talking and talking... What was that? Something just hit us. - Ronon! - Where are we? Daedalus, 302 bay. We saw you, scooped you up, - heading back to Atlantis. - Thank God! - Midway was destroyed. - Yeah, we saw. Where's Sheppard? He lasted about a day, sealed himself in there. No wonder he didn't hear the radio call. Thank God! I almost shot 'em myself with a stunner. Yeah. I understand. - Where are we? - Daedalus, 302 bay.</i> What's the status of SGC? Secure. Teal'c and I took care of the Wraith. I figured you would. Come on, let's get the hell outta here. Yeah. And I passed my interview with the IOA.
