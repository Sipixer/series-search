mission report since I assumed command of this base? 'Cause I haven't given you any? As you know, one of the changes I made around here is to require every team member to file mission reports, as opposed to only team leaders and science officers. Really. I didn't know that. I announced it my fourth day here, at an away-team orientation meeting - detailing changes to mission protocol. - Was I there? Yes. It was mandatory. - Because I don't remember... - I saw you there. It's kind of hard to miss you. Look, my point is I want you to file a report every mission. I'm not good at writing. I figured you might say that. Use this. It's a digital voice recorder. Speak into it, we'll plug it in, and your report will be automatically transcribed and filed with the others. I'm not good at talking, either. I'm sorry. Too fast for you, buddy boy? Nursing home just called, Rodney. They want their scooter back. Scooter? That is a tri-cell li-po pack under my hood, son. Sorry. My bad. - I will trample you. - Well, don't trip on your skirt. You okay? I could have dropped him! - We didn't know anyone was around. - What are you doing down here anyway? Trying to get Torren to sleep. Walking him is the best way to calm him. He's colicky? Dr. Keller says it's a phase that will pass. I was a colicky baby too. Just do what my mom did, which was let me cry myself to sleep. I'm no worse for it. Anyway... we usually take turns walking him, but Kanaan is away visiting our people for a few days. I'd help you out, but it looks like you've got everything taken care of. Yes. Now all I have to do is get him back to my quarters without waking him... Or being run over. We're done here. We're just, you know, finishing up. - 'Night. - 'Night. Good one. Go, go, go! I must have put too much strain on the motor. Shaft needs a bushing lube. What? What's that about? Beats me. Come in. Control room, it's Dr. McKay. We just lost power in the east pier. What's going on? That's strange. Lights are out except the control room. Why is that? This is Dr. Rodney McKay, calling the control room. Please respond. Something's definitely not right. Season 5 Episode 14 The Prodigal (v. 1.00) The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams Rodney, are you there? Colonel Sheppard? Everything's dead. No way of knowing what's going on. All right. Rivers. Fan out, find as many marines as you can, work your way up to the central tower. If you run into Woolsey, let me know. No communications. We're on walkies. - What's going on? - You don't know either? I'm going to the control tower. I tried to radio you. Power's out except for the central tower. Here. Go to the main power room. See if you can reboot the system - from there. - Okay. All right. Hello? - <i>Rodney, do you read me?</i> - Yeah, Radek. Go ahead. I've tried to restart power. So far, absolutely no success. - What about the ZPM? - <i>I've checked it,</i> as well as the naquadah generator. Neither are online. Someone must have disabled them from the control room.</i> No, they wouldn't have any power up either. Not unless they're using an external power source. Okay, listen to me. I want you to do exactly the same thing. Initiate a temporary patch using an external power source... One of the auxiliary battery units. Yes, but that won't be enough to power the entire City. Just get me enough juice to access the mainframe. We can figure out what's going on. All right. Whereabouts are you right now? Level 36? 35. Great. 35. Perfect. So just another 28 floors to go, and that's just this stairwell. And then we get to level 63, got to cross over to an ancillary stairwell, climb another four levels... That's just to access the Gate room... See if you can route some of that power to the transporters while you're at it. All right, I'll try. This door leads to the Gate room stairwell, right? Yeah. Well, maybe the door was already closed when we lost power. It was sealed on purpose to keep people out. What, you think someone's infiltrated Atlantis? Talk to me. I've initiated a temporary patch. I was able to route power to your lab. - Well, what about the transporters? - <i>Still working on it.</i> Yeah, well, let me know when you've got one online. Go to your lab and try to tap into the mainframe. I'll try the other stairwells. They're probably blocked too, but... maybe there's another way up. All right. - Colonel. - That one sealed too? All the stairwell doors are. Been trying to find a way up to the Gate room. So have we. - Any idea what's going on yet? - McKay's still working on it. - I guess we could blow the door. - Probably, but we're not there yet. I need to know what we're up against before we go storming up there. - Any luck? - Not much. You're right. Someone's taken over Atlantis. I'm having a hard time accessing several of the critical systems. And the ones that I can access are read-only. What're you... How did you get up here so fast? I was able to get some of the transporters back online again. - What about the one on the Gate room? - No. There's a lockout code in place on that one. - Surveillance cameras. - We've got closed-circuit feeds - on the control room. - If you're not locked out of those. They're not critical systems. I should be able to access them if... Got it. A Puddle Jumper? - Who is that? - It's definitely not from Atlantis. - Can you get Woolsey's office? - Yeah, hang on. Oh, my God. Is that...? Hello, Teyla. How did you get here? The ship I borrowed from your people. It has provided me with a wealth of information and technology... And the key to infiltrating this base. Use this. It's a digital voice recorder. Speak into it, we'll plug it in, and your report will be automatically transcribed and filed with the others. I'm not good at talking, either. Unscheduled off-world activation. - Is the shield raised? - Yes, Sir. Major Nelson's IDC. They're early. Not due back until tomorrow. All right, let them in. It's not going up to the Jumper bay. What's wrong? Major Nelson, what's your status? What is that? Get everybody out of here. Get 'em out now! Closing all immediate access doors. - I've activated the Portal's shield. - Good. What about the external power interface? We're connected. The control room level is now drawing power directly from the ship. - Is the stun field holding? - Yes. Two levels above and below us are protected. Now we can get to work. Get to work on what? Forgive me. I forgot to congratulate you. What's his name? No matter. We don't have much time, I'm afraid. My hybrids are preparing to activate Atlantis' self-destruct device. As soon as they do that, - we will leave. - You're going to destroy Atlantis? A punishment richly deserved. Not that I expect you to agree with me. But don't worry. Your baby will be safe. You are not taking my son. Yes, Teyla. I am. You know how important your child is to me. His father and you have given him a powerful gift that I will utilize to exert greater control over my legion of hybrids. He is the key to increasing my strength, securing my reign over the galaxy. Your "reign" is over. You will not make it out of here alive. - My people will make certain... - Enough! Enough. You think you've weakened me. You've destroyed my facilities, ruined much of my research, but you cannot... You cannot... weaken my resolve. Make no mistake, Teyla. I am as strong now as I have ever been. Look around you. I am in control of Atlantis, the very place where your people ended my life as I knew it. It's only fitting that I return... to extinguish this blight from the galaxy once and for all. - I thought Michael was dead. - As did I. - I mean, we blew up his ship, right? - He's the one who stole our Jumper, used it to escape from his cruiser before we could destroy it. He's like a cockroach. Every time you try to step on him, he just skitters away. All right, we need to get moving. You and your team take this stairwell. My team will take this stairwell. We move into position. You wait for my mark to blast the door. We head up, retake the Gate room. McKay, you're with me. Zelenka, try to figure this thing out. Certainly. We're giving Michael no quarter. If you get a shot at him, take it. Make sure he's dead. Let's move. I must speak with you. We are still having difficulty with the self-destruct device. - Why? - As I told you, the encryption is much more complex than we had anticipated. We have run several integer factorization algorithms. Nothing has worked so far. - Keep at it. - For how long? As long as it takes. It is a matter of time before the others figure out a way through our defenses. I know. But you will have solved the encryption problem before then. We have the baby. We don't have to remain here. We are not leaving until that device is armed. Problems? Nothing that can't be dealt with. You do know Colonel Sheppard is no doubt preparing teams to retake the Gate room. Of course, probably moving them into place as we speak. Don't worry. They're not getting in here. Major, what's your status? C-4 is in place, Colonel. Ready when you are. Fire in the hole. On my mark. Three, two, one, mark. Move! We're picking up a serious energy reading up ahead. What is it? I don't know, but we should stop until I do. Major Lorne, hold up. Colonel Sheppard, Major Lorne is down. - What happened? - I don't know. I think he hit some kind of force field. - He's alive, but unconscious. - <i>Get him out of there and fall back.</i> Looks like he's got himself a force field. He's nothing if not annoyingly industrious. - What do we do? - We disable it. - How? - We... we... good question. I've been examining the energy reading we picked up, and it appears that Michael has somehow managed to modify the Wraith stun-pulse technology and integrate it with the Puddle Jumper cloaking mechanism... - Creating a kind of "stun-bubble"... - No, a force field around the control room and the Gate room. While it's in place, we're not getting in there. I know that. What you haven't told me is how we're gonna turn it off. Because we haven't figured that out yet. It's gonna be very tricky. Michael is using the Puddle Jumper as an external power source, for the control room and the Gate room, also to power the stun-bubble... - Enough with the "stun-bubble". - That's an accurate description... - No, it's a stupid description... - Guys, guys... Look, the point is that if we wanna disable the stun... the force field, then we first need to disable the power from the Jumper. Or we figure out a way to override the mainframe lockouts Michael has. - All right, how's that going? - It's not. Not yet. Keep working on it. I'm gonna check on Lorne. What happened? That Puddle Jumper that came through... it sent out some kind of stun wave, knocked everybody out. - All of Atlantis? - I don't know. Probably. Don't worry, they'll wake up soon. Everyone has a different level of resistance. Here. - Who would do this? - I don't know. That's what I wanna find out. Can you open that door? - I think so. - Good. Do it. Still nothing. There was a time you understood me, Teyla. When your people brought me here, gave me the retrovirus that turned me into a human, you alone showed me compassion. You were the voice of conscience. I've given this a great deal of thought. I've... I'm willing to return the favor. I would very much like for you to come with me. You can care for your child, and I will care for the both of you. I would rather die. I promise... I will not harm either of you. Teyla... - You have to believe me. - I can not trust the word of a murderer. Why can't you understand? I have become what I am out of necessity, the need to survive! You became what you are out of vengeance. Do you not punish criminals in your world? - Are they not brought to justice? - Is this justice to you? Killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people across this galaxy? They would not be dead had you not made me the subject of your vicious experiment! Their blood is on your hands! It's your choice. You can come with me and live, or remain here and die. Either way, I'm taking your child. We need to blow up the Jumper. If we blow it up, we cut the power and disable the force field, right? Great plan... I'm not entirely clear on how you intend on doing the blowing up. - Fire a drone at it. - We can't. The Chair room requires more power than the auxiliary batteries can provide. I was barely able to bring enough power into this lab, let alone - the transporters I could bring online. - Then, we'll take a Jumper. Again, I come back to my question of how? - No way of getting to the Jumper bay. - We take one from the underwater bay. - Fly it up to the tower, - fire a drone through the window, and take out Michael's Jumper. What? No, no, no, that's a good plan, except I see one small problem... which is that the underwater Jumper bay only has a couple of Jumpers in it. - Well, we only need one. - Yes, well, the thing is... Both were severely damaged in the flood. Neither of them is able to fly. That was two years ago, Radek. McKay already fixed them. - You've gotta be kidding me... - It was the next thing on my list. - You said you were gonna fix them. - I was getting to it, I swear. And you had two years! I was busy! Perhaps we should go and see if we can fix one of them. That's a good idea, but I want you stay here to try to override Michael's lockouts. Why don't I stay here and work on that? Zelenka can go with you to the bay. Because I want you to come with me and fix those Jumpers like you said you were gonna do two years ago. - Let's go. - Please tell me there's a transporter. Well, there's no one by the Jumper bay, but there's one two levels down. That'll do. Nice. You can fight. Five years of kick-boxing. That's good to know. What happened? It's Michael and his hybrids. I counted three of 'em. I'm not sure how many more there are. They all had to fit in that Jumper. Unless more came through on foot afterward. What do we do? Try to get to the armory, come back and retake the Gate room. Sounds like a plan. You two, come with us. Banks, stay here with them, keep everyone calm. And if any more hybrids show up, just do what you did earlier. ... speak with you again. It's urgent. Stay with him. What is it? We were finally able to decipher the encryption on the self-destruct device. Good. Prepare the ship to leave. We'll arm the self-destruct, and switch the power back to Atlantis' systems a split-second before we leave. The timing of the switch must be precise. I don't want to give them any opportunity to disarm the device. I'll make the calculations. Change of plans. We're not going to the armory. - Why? What happened? - They armed the self-destruct. Mr. Woolsey, would you please head back to the others? Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla. Can you hear me? John, this is Teyla. Please respond. Colonel Shep... Colonel Sheppard. Ronon is in the control room. He's fighting with Michael! We're almost at the Jumper bay. Keep us posted. Teyla, run! Teyla! - Are you all right? - Yes. But Ronon needs our help. We need to get back up to the control room. Radek? Tell us what's going on up there. I... I can't tell. Ronon is down. He might just be unconscious. Tell me when he comes to. What have we got? It's like I said... Both of the Jumpers are toast. This one's got a whack of problems, starting with zero power. - You said the other Jumper's got power. - Yeah, but not much else. - Drive pods won't extend, no drones... - This one's got drones. So if we bring power over to this, we can get drive pods working, right? I harvest parts from the Jumpers, cobble together a fix so one of them will work? - Is it possible? - Doubtful. - But maybe... - It's a long shot at best. Perfect. Get to it. What do you need, 15 minutes? Great, just great. Must've locked out the transporters. - We need to get to the control room. - Too dangerous. Not without weapons. - Where's the nearest stairwell? - Around the corner. This way. Let me lead. Okay, give 'er. - Drive pods are go. - All right, we're getting somewhere. I got juice, I got life support, I got... - Come on! - What? The weapons won't come online. - Why not? - I don't know. Well, figure it out. We need those drones. Where is she? We don't know. We searched everywhere. Are you telling me she just disappeared? I'm saying that we searched every room and corridor within the stun field. We couldn't find her anywhere. She knows this City well. She's hiding somewhere. She's toying with me! - We'll keep looking. - No. I'll handle this. - What are you going to do? - Flush her out. That's Atlantis' self-destruct. Michael's gonna blow up the City. - How much time do we have? - He set it for 10 minutes. How much time before you get those drones? If I can get them working at all, a lot more than 10 minutes! - All right, forget about it. - What are you doing? Gonna fly the Jumper and crash it into the Tower. - Crash it? - It's our best chance. And yourself. I have crashed Jumpers into the Tower before. Not like this you haven't. In addition to the weapons, the inertial dampeners are out. You'll need to impact Michael's Jumper with enough force to do some damage, which means a lot of speed when you hit that tower. Look, this is a suicide mission. I know you can hear me. That alarm, if you're not aware, is Atlantis' self-destruct device.</i> I've armed it, set it for 10 minutes.</i> That is the amount of time you have to consider the offer I'm about to make.</i> If you will surrender yourself and your child to me, I'll disarm the device, sparing the lives of everyone on this base. If not... You, your baby, and everyone else will die. Okay, you're good to go. Make sure that strike team is ready to move as soon as that field drops. Don't accelerate too fast coming out of the Jumper bay. If you hit the gas too hard, you're gonna flatten like a pancake. Right. What? Well, it's just... What you're about to do is... Yeah. It's not like it's the first time. How many suicide missions have I flown? - I don't know. I lost count. - Well, there you go. All right, well, you know... Here's to many more. Yeah, Radek. Go ahead. I've figured out how to override some of Michael's lockout codes.</i> That's great. Can you shut down the self-destruct? No, no, that will take a little bit more time. I have managed to get the access doors to the Gate room open. Well, that does us absolutely no good. The stun field is still in effect. The transporter on the Gate room level? No, no, I still don't have control of that, either. - For crying out loud... - <i>I'm sorry, I'm doing the best I can.</i> Michael has placed several highly encrypted codes... Just... What about the Gate shield? Can you lower it? Yes. That I can do. Great. You don't have to do your <i>kamikaze</i> run. - Why not? - Fly to the Tower, get in proximity, dial the DHD to a random planet, we'll have Radek lower the Gate shield, allowing the vortex to obliterate Michael's Jumper... or most of it. Now, that's a good plan. - Where are you going? - You're gonna fly it. That frees me up to lead the strike team. You said it... it's simple enough. You just dial the Gate. - I guess I can do that. - Go easy on the accelerator. Radek, get ready to drop that shield on my mark. Right... We don't have much time. We need to leave this place. Time is short, Teyla. I don't understand... I would think the choice is an easy one... If nothing else, consider your child.</i> By remaining in hiding, you are sentencing him to die.</i> What kind of mother would do such a thing?</i> He has a chance to live. Both of you do. Come with me, Teyla. Trust me... I will not harm either of you. And I will not harm Atlantis. You have my word. Turn off the self-destruct system. You want me to trust you? Then show me you mean what you say. Turn off the self-destruct system, and I will come with you.</i> All right, I'm in the air... approaching the central tower. Copy that. Zelenka, you ready? Ready when you are. Michael, can you hear me? Less than two minutes. We need to go. Now. I hear you. You disappoint me. So I will leave you to the fate you have chosen. But I'm not leaving alone. You should know that I've already collected your son's DNA...</i> Cloning him will require additional time,</i> delaying the implementation of my plan,</i> but as you well know, I will not be deterred. Good-bye, Teyla. What are you doing? Collecting one last prize. I'm in position. Ready to dial. Radek, drop the shield. The shield's down! - <i>The stun field is neutralized!</i> - Is the self-destruct disabled? It shut off when the Jumper's power was cut. Good. I'm heading back. Go ahead and reboot the City's power. I'm already doing it. Get a medic! Close the Jumper bay doors, Radek! Amelia... - Will you take care of Torren for me? - Of course. Make sure no one leaves. How's Dr. Keller's most cantankerous patient? You've gotta be kidding me. You get released, and I gotta stay here another day? Because I only fell down a flight of stairs. You, my friend, were hurled from a much greater height. You're lucky you suffered a concussion and didn't break your neck. Nothing. I'm fine. I know you are. But listen to the Doctor. Anyway, I just wanted to drop by and commend you for your exemplary work. Your courage in the face of danger continues to amaze and, dare I say, inspire me. Thanks. Get some rest. And don't worry. Your team's not going anywhere without you. That reminds me. I know Michael attacking the City isn't really a mission, but I filed a report anyways. Splendid. Thank you. Mission report... Michael invaded Atlantis, tried to blow it up. We stopped him. End of report. Take a good long look, 'cause soon you're gonna see nothing but taillights. Nice try, speed racer. I'm sorry. Sorry, we were just, you know... - Who's winning? - I am. Still colicky, huh? He was awake all day. Refused to take a nap. That's not surprising. He got a full night's sleep. Yes, it's remarkable. He slept through the entire ordeal. He hasn't slept through a whole night in... ever. Well, he can rest easy now, 'cause Michael's out of the picture. Unfortunately, there will be somebody else to take his place. I am certain. He's got super mom watching his back. If you ask me, he's in good hands. Torren, do you wanna watch me kick Rodney's ass? You may wanna cover the child's eyes,
