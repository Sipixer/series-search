me of his deeds simply referred to him... ... as a great hero of the town. A warrior who possesses almost superhuman-like powers. WEIR : We’ve sent teams to this planet before. They’re good traders and kind people. l don’t recall there being many superheroes. Sounds like one of my people. WEIR : Well, whoever it is, it would be nice to have someone like that on our side. If the rumors are true, sounds to me someone’s imagination’s run a little wild. As l said, my fellow Athosian who spoke to me of this hero... ... saw him in action against several armed men. l do that all the time. - Where’s McKay ? McKAY : l’m here, l’m here. l had to get my autograph book in case... ... Teyla’s superhero turned out to be the real deal. Well, at the very least... ... see if you can establish trade relations with the townspeople. We will. Dial the gate. SHEPPARD : My childhood hero was Evel Knievel. TEYLA : Was he not evil ? SHEPPARD : No, that was just his name. He was a daredevil, which isn’t a kind of a devil. He jumped motorcycles over things. DEX : Why ? SHEPPARD : Just because. Didn’t always make it, either. TEYLA : And you greatly admired this behavior ? SHEPPARD : No, l just... Look, at least my hero is human. McKay’s is Batman. McKAY : Misunderstood and unappreciated by many. His most formidable weapon was the power of his brilliant mind. Not just a hero, a superhero. Dougy Angus, the Highland giant. Not only a hero, but a legend in Scotland. Namakaeha Towrik, my first unit commander. He once fought and killed 12 enemy soldiers... ... gutting them with his bare hands. He was also a funny guy too. Yes, l can imagine the jokes and the entrails flying. Good day, travelers. Good day to you. This is your first visit to our village ? Several of my people have said that you are good and fair traders. We are. My fellow Athosians also speak of a great hero who protects this town. Rumor has it he’s a warrior with some impressive kills, including the Wraith. This is true. Then there’s a good chance he is one of my people. Can you take us to him ? Of course. This way. [PEOPLE LAUGHING ] Here he is. The mightiest of heroes, our champion protector. - Lucius Luvin. - Well. Will you look who it is. DEX : You’ve got to be kidding me. LUCIUS : As l lay there, the Iratus bug’s tendrils... ... just grasping my throat, choking me. l could feel my very life essence ebb and wane. With every passing second, l could feel myself drawing closer to death. Had l been the only one in that building... ... the only one in that burning building, l would have surrendered... ... and allowed sleep to overtake me. But there were women and children there with me whose very survival... ... lay in my hands, and l’m not about to let them down. So l reached deep down within me, and l summoned whatever strength l had... ... and l grabbed that bug, and l ripped him away... ... and through sheer force of will, l began to choke him, and-- Ow, ow ! Ow ! Ow ! - l thought that wasn’t gonna hurt. - l lied. Ow. And l sprang up, and l led them all to safety. [CROWD CHEERING ] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. l appreciate it. Thanks very much. How ? What ? How’d you lead the people to safety ? You said the way out was blocked. Well, you were listening. That’s good. That’s good, because it was. It was blocked, until... ... l cleared a path through the burning wreckage... ... and ignoring the searing heat... ... and the flames that were just... ... swirling and swirling-- - But how did you-- ? - Okay, that’s enough... ... reminiscing for today. There’s plenty more where that story came from. When we gather tomorrow... ... l’Il tell you about how l was almost seduced by a beautiful Ancient. BECKETT : Sounds entertaining. Yeah, you’d think, but between you and me, not much. You know, your stories are awfully fascinating and familiar. All right. l admit, l took some inspiration... ... from some of the mission reports that l perused while l was on Atlantis... ... but l spiced them. A little story here, a bit of a story there. All right, l’m done here. No, you’re not gonna find any trace of that special herb in my system. l learned my lesson the last time, thanks to all of you. You mean these people are not drugged... ... they simply adore you for who you are ? Yeah. Isn’t that great ? You don’t believe me. Lucius, l have a lab set up, so l think l’Il just run the test anyway. You’re wasting your time. In all modesty... ... these people love me, pure and true. Lucius, you can’t say anything modestly. l saved them. A couple of months ago, these ruffians come into town, start causing trouble. l beat them up, l chase them away... ... and all of a sudden l’m the town hero. They’re giving me gifts... ... the women, they’re throwing themselves at me. Just like the old days, except better, because now they’re not drugged. Hang on, hang on. So you beat them up ? LUCIUS : Yes, me. - l did. - How’d you manage that ? It’s not so hard when you’re invincible. l’m invincible. [CHUCKLES] Right. All right. Looks like this is gonna take some convincing. Now, let me see. Perfect. Hey, time for a demonstration. TEYLA : What is he-- ? Let it go. Trust me. Drop it. GIRL : Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. Hit me. - Don’t. - Come on, hit me. l wouldn’t. l’m telling you, don’t. Ah ! Ah ! See ? Invincible. l can’t be vinced. LUCIUS : As it turns out, l had this personal shield all along. It was a gift from one of my admirers back at the old village... ... before l was forced to pack up and leave, thank you. l didn’t even know what it was until l went to Atlantis... ... perused some of the reports about the Ancient devices that you discovered. You did an awful lot of perusing while you were on the base. l peruse. It’s a gift. Hey, sweetheart. - Say you come by my place tonight ? - No, thanks. Wait, wait, wait. l’m the town hero. That was ages ago. Let me tell you something. You’re only as good as your last rescue. How is it that you’re able to operate... ... Ancient technology without the ATA gene ? Oh, that was easy. All l did was find a guy with the gene... ... have him initiate the device. It took a long time, but once it was done, l could activate this thing anytime. Fascinating. You do know those things run out of juice eventually ? Come on. These Ancient things last forever. Lunch is on me. l’m gonna go take a walk. If l don’t see you before you leave, well, then l’Il just talk to you later. We’re not going until we get those results. Whatever you want. People to save. Well, what do you think ? TEYLA : Perhaps he’s learned a lesson. - He’s Lucius. Are you kidding me ? Well, he’s made a lot of mistakes in the past, but, well, who hasn’t ? Why are you looking at me ? He’s trying to do something good in order to get people to like him this time. Well, l’ve completed my tests. Looks like Lucius is telling the truth. No traces of the drug in his system. He’s clean. - That’s our cue to leave. McKAY : Wait, wait, wait. l’m the only one that thinks he’s taking advantage of people. You want another crack at that shield. You’re damn right l do. Look, it could come in extremely handy. He’s practically wasting it. Where’s Lucius ? He went out for a stroll. He should be returning shortly. Well, whenever he gets back, tell him we said goodbye. AMARIS : All right. l think we’re making a mistake. We’Il have the Athosians keep an eye out on everyone. If anything gets out of control, we’Il come back. [WOMAN SCREAMING ] Drop your weapons or die where you stand. l said drop your weapons. We’re not looking for a fight. We’re just passing through town. l’ve got two on my right, and one straight dead ahead. Two at 12 o’clock, one behind the fruit stand. If we act now we risk injuring innocent villagers. And us. We risk injuring us. l can take mine before they get a shot. There may be others hidden where we cannot see. It’s your call. SHEPPARD : Here’s the thing. If we all start shooting at each other somebody’s bound to get hurt. l can pretty much guarantee you’Il be one of them. Are you this hero we’ve heard rumors of ? No. Come here. Come. Come on. Then lower your weapons. Okay. DEX : Sheppard ? - Trust me on this one. HAEMON : So where is this hero ? One who’d surely stop us from emptying the town’s coffers... ... helping ourselves to its women... ... and burning it to the ground once we’re done. So tell me, where is he ? Where is this brave hero who would keep us from destroying everything ? LUCIUS : He’s right here. [PEOPLE CHEERING ] For l am the man you seek. Kill him. Get out. Don’t come back. For so long as l protect these people... ... this town shall be safe. [PEOPLE CHEERING ] MAN 1 : Lucius ! MAN 2 : Lucius ! CROWD [CHANTING ] : Lucius, Lucius, Lucius ! [ALL LAUGHING ] LUCIUS : So l finish off the last Wraith guard... ... l turn around, l look at the queen, and l say : « You know, if you were 20 pounds heavier, you’d look like my ex-wife. » [ALL LAUGHING ] l said that because she was just so fat. Hey, Colonel Sheppard. Hey, come in. Sit down, sit down. Make way. - Let him have a seat. - No, no, we have to go. You’re sure ? They’re making a schnitzel in my honor tonight. No, we gotta get back. l guess the only thing left to do is for you to thank me. What for ? For saving your lives. - Thank you. - Please. - It was nothing. - Yeah, it was nothing. What are you talking about, « It was nothing« ou » ?? These people had you on your knees. - Yes, they did. LUCIUS : Well... ... you’re welcome. Be careful on the way back to the gate... ... because there’s talk of some angry raiders in the area. No, no, no, let’s go. You know what ? l’m gonna go out for a walk, take a look around... ... make sure those ruffians are gone for good, all right ? Don’t you worry, l’Il be back. LUCIUS : Nice job, everybody. - Very convincing. HAEMON : A little too convincing. You took out three of Lanko’s teeth, broke Fortnum’s wrist. Hey, l had to make it look good. Here’s a little something that may make it worthwhile. This isn’t the amount we agreed on. Yeah, well, to tell you the truth... ... you guys didn’t really seem to have your hearts in it. We made a deal. Well, maybe next time you’Il make more of an effort. How dare you speak down to us ? We were elite soldiers in the Genii army. Cowan’s personal guard. Yeah, you were. Now you’re mercenaries. Come on, as far as jobs-for-hire go, this wasn’t so bad. You come in, you scare a few people, you take a few punches, then you leave. You get paid, nobody gets hurt. Well, except for Lanko... ... and of course, Fortnum, with his gimpy wrist. Sorry about that. We may have been forced from our homes when Ladon Radim took power... ... we’re still Genii. One of these days we’Il march into the capital and retake what was ours. Yeah, well, good luck with that. [PEOPLE LAUGHING ] Kick it. Kick it. Oh, please, come on. There you go. Yeah. Anybody else ? Anybody else wanna take a crack at me, huh ? Hey. Hey, what are you doing back here ? l thought you left town. We were leaving when we ran into this gentleman who has... ... a very interesting story to tell. Speaking of stories, did l ever tell the story about... ... the time l was on this planet made entirely of lava-- There’s no point in pretending, Lucius. You lied to these people. SHEPPARD : This man’s not a hero. He paid those men to show up, then made it look like he came to your rescue. It’s true. It was all a setup to make him look like he saved the town. Deceiver. You do have every right to be upset with him. Not him. You. Me ? Unable to accept the shame of surrendering to those raiders... ... he chooses to besmirch our Lucius. The whole thing was an act. The guns weren’t even loaded. If it were not for Lucius you would all be dead. MAN 1 : Yeah. - No, he tricked you. - You don’t know him like we do. - We’re the good guys. - Oh, please. MAN 2 : Get out of here. MAN 3 : Go. Leave. You’re not welcome here. Go away. Go back to where you came from. LUCIUS : Listen, l want to apologize for the whole angry mob thing. TEYLA : l suppose we should be grateful. McKAY : Yes, well, he did stop them from swarming us. Just consider it my way of saying all is forgiven. - All right, l’m putting a stop to this. - Oh, come on, they just got started. l’m not talking about the foot massage. Actually, l am talking about the foot massage. All right, all right. Girls, come back later, all right ? This little scam of yours-- Scam ? What scam ? You are taking advantage of these people. It looks that way, but l was being honest about those thugs... ... that attacked this village a couple months ago. This is a nice town, nice people. They needed somebody to save them, so l did. l was a hero. - Today’s incident-- - Performance. It was just my way of reminding them of that fact. l insisted the guns not be loaded so nobody would get hurt. - That was nice of you. LUCIUS : Yeah. - You had to go and figure it out. - Go out there now... ... and come clean with these people. - Or else. - Or else what ? Ah-ah-ah. No, you can’t threaten me on account of my shield. They won’t believe you. You’re trying to figure out a way to hurt me, aren’t you ? Yep. Yeah, well, you keep thinking, big boy, because-- [GUNFIRE & PEOPLE SCREAMING ] It’s not me this time, l swear. [GUNFIRE & PEOPLE SCREAMING ] Kolya. SHEPPARD : The soldiers are Genii, and they’re part-- l know all about Kolya and the Genii. When l was on Atlantis, l perused-- Mission reports. Right, right. - This is very bad. - No, no, this is great. This’Il be an opportunity for me to solidify my place in the community. - They’Il give me a parade after this one. SHEPPARD : Hey, hang on. You’re not taking on Kolya and his men. Why ? They can’t hurt me. l’ve got the shield. And if they burn the town down around you out of spite ? Well, that’d be petty of them. Yeah, well, they’re like that. DEX : Obviously somebody tipped them off that we’re here. - So go ahead, shoot them. - Good idea. TEYLA : Colonel, you can’t. - Just Kolya. - The shooting will not stop them. - She’s right. We’Il have to kill them all. - l’m all right with that, by the way. - Good, let’s do it. - John. - What ? - You can’t. - Oh, l’m pretty sure l can. In fact-- If we open fire with them, many of these townspeople will be killed. They do not deserve to die because of us. If they search the town and cannot find us, then they will simply move on. Nobody gets hurt. That’s my vote, and my heartfelt recommendation. You want to hide. We could call it strategic concealment. - l got just the place. SHEPPARD : Well, l’m sure you do. Here. See, l like to entertain... ... and on occasion a husband will get angry, come looking for his wife... - ... so to avoid an awkward scenario-- - Okay, we get it. LUCIUS : l’Il let you know when the bad guys clear out. Don’t screw around, Lucius, all right ? Tell them we’ve moved on. Once they get out of town or out in the open we’Il deal with it ourselves. It’s no time to be a hero, you understand ? - Perfectly. - l’m serious. l can see that. No heroics. LUCIUS : All right, that’s enough. Take your men and get out. This town is under my protection. Is it ? It is. So you got two choices : You can either leave, or l’Il make you leave. Interesting. - Is that the best you can do ? - As a matter of fact... ... no, it isn’t. [GASPING & COUGHING ] l admit, l got a shield, but l gotta breathe. l should’ve thought of that. Not so invincible now, are we, hero ? - You led them here ? - They’ve been looking for Sheppard. - We had a deal. HAEMON : l saw an opportunity, l took it. No different than what you did. But l didn’t hurt anybody. All right, that guy, Lanko, and the one with the gimpy wrist. Look, l don’t wanna hurt you or anyone in this town. All l want is Sheppard and his team. But l told you, you missed them. Maybe if you hurry, you can get them before they get to the gate. My men are already guarding the gate. l’Il ask you once more. Where are they ? l don’t know. l don’t. Well, then we’Il have to do a thorough job of searching the area... ... which could take hours. How long can you hold your breath ? Well, that didn’t take too long. All right, let’s get out of this town... ... and set up a decent ambush without all these people around. They weren’t there. Really ? That’s weird. l wonder where they could’ve gone. That personal shield of yours is very interesting. Yeah. If we were to bury you alive, it would protect you from the weight of the soil... ... but you would still suffocate. A fascinating way to die, don’t you think ? l gotta tell you, it’s not that fascinating to me. It is to me. Wait, wait, you can’t kill me. Look, l’m the perfect bait. If Sheppard finds out that l’m in trouble he’s gonna come rescue me. We’re really close. You and Sheppard ? - Yeah. - l don’t think so. Then Weir, or Rodney, or Carson. We’re like the best of friends. - And how is it you know them so well ? - l spent some time in Atlantis. It’s the nicest place l’ve ever been. Best time l ever had. l remember it like l was there this morning. Tell me more. So l finish off the last Wraith guard, and l turn to the queen, and l say : « If you were 20 pounds heavier you’d look like my ex-wife. » [ALL LAUGHING ] Of course, my ex-wife was a knockout, but where’s the funny in that ? [ALL LAUGHING ] That personal shield is amazing. You mind if l try it ? - Yeah, go ahead. - l’Il give it back. [LAUGHING ] Got you. What, you think l’d let you have this ? - You’d kill me right on the spot. - Yeah, slit your throat from ear to ear. [ALL LAUGHING ] Good times. Good times. l love hearing about your former wives, but l’d rather hear more about Atlantis. - l told you everything already. - In that case... ... it’s getting late, and l could use some rest before the funeral. Funeral ? Oh, no. Oh, no, don’t bury me alive. Please. l don’t deserve that. Nobody deserves that. l deserve banishment. That’s what l-- SHEPPARD : Lucius. - What are you doing here ? Kolya’s got all the exits out of town covered... ... and rumor has it they were gonna bury you alive. - l can’t believe it. You came to save me ? - Yeah, neither can l. - Let’s go. - l can’t, l’m tied to the chair. Oh, no. Good luck with that shield. Wait, wait. Come on, untie me. McKAY : Ow. MAN : We have them. [LUCIUS COUGHING ] What, are you crazy ? You could’ve killed me. That shield of yours impresses me more and more. You did your part, Lucius. You get to live another day. Sheppard ? He got away. That’s unfortunate. [CLICK] Thanks for sparing me, sir. Don’t disappoint me again. Secure the prisoners. Perhaps they’Il be more effective bait. Get this fixed. - Do you think he got away ? - If they’d captured the colonel... - ... wouldn’t he be here with us ? - He’Il be back in a Jumper in no time. Your friend escaped the village. They are still looking for him. If they haven’t found him, chances are he managed to slip the perimeter. Yes, he and Lucius are no doubt plotting our rescue. Lucius ? He would not abandon us. Sure. Like he wouldn’t sell us out while we try to rescue him. He would never do that. Okay, you know what ? Just stop it, all right ? Lucius is not a superhero. Batman, that’s a superhero. l don’t understand. Your people cannot place their future in Lucius’hands. The time has come for you to save yourselves. We have no hope of defeating these soldiers. You will with our help. Then why did you not do so before ? We were concerned for the safety of the village. - Now we don’t care. - Okay, just... ... pretend he didn’t say that, and then just let us out of here. No, it’s too dangerous. Best to wait for Lucius to return, then he’Il save us all. No, wait. Lucius isn’t a hero. [CRACKLING ] Don’t, don’t. l swear l didn’t know about the bomb. - l don’t know what they were doing. - How’d you get out ? Everybody’s looking for you. l walked unnoticed. Isn’t that something ? - What are we gonna do ? - What are we gonna do ? l’Il tell you what l’m gonna do. l’Il get by Kolya’s men, get to the gate and call for reinforcements. Reinforcements ? - What do you say we get off this planet ? - My team is back there. So is a guy who wants to bury me alive. You’re done playing hero now, are you ? You can leave as soon as we get to the gate. Keep up. - You’re angry. See, that’s anger. - Shut up. You’re not trying to dig your way out of here ? Find another spoon. This will go twice as fast. Someone’s coming. l have to give Colonel Sheppard credit. No one’s caused me this much trouble. Unfortunately, l’m going to have to kill him. - Funny, he says the same about you. - Really ? l’m flattered. You can’t kill him if you can’t catch him. l will, eventually. McKAY : And what about us ? How do we fit into your evil plans for galactic domination ? You’Il be allowed to stay alive for the time being... ... unless you were stupid enough to eat the meal you were served. [KOLYA LAUGHS] l’m just kidding. - Oh, thank God. - In fact... ... l intend to send you back, in exchange for a few things. There is no way Dr. Weir will cut a deal with you... ... even if our lives are in danger. You know that. In the past, l may have been a little too ambitious with my demands. This time, however, l have no intention of backing Dr. Weir into a corner. After all, what’s a small number of your P90s, a few grenades... ... and some ammunition in exchange for your lives ? And who knows... ... if we’re successful in toppling Ladon... ... and l assume rightful leadership of the Genii... - ... we could end up allies. - That’s not gonna happen, Kolya. While we’re standing here having this little chat... ... no doubt Colonel Sheppard reached the Stargate and contacted Atlantis. In just a matter of minutes, this village will be swarming with our people. And l can guarantee you that’s not going to happen either. LUCIUS : l don’t believe this. It’s like the worst day you could imagine. KOLYA [ON RADIO] : <i>Colonel Sheppard ?</i> I’m going to assume you can hear me. I’m also going to assume... ... if you haven’t reached the gate by now, you soon will. So l wanna save you some trouble. My men have secured the gate. There’s no way you’re getting through. Come back and face me, colonel... ... or l’Il start killing your friends. Which one of them shall we kill first ? l’m leaning toward Dr. McKay, myself. - Colonel ? SHEPPARD : <i>Kolya, this is Sheppard.</i> -I’m coming back. - Don’t keep me waiting. McKAY : That’s what this is all about ? - Killing Sheppard ? - Absolutely, Dr. McKay. But don’t feel left out. If l don’t get those weapons from Dr. Weir, l intend to kill you as well. l’m coming with you. - Are you sure ? - No. Yeah, l am, l am. l’m coming with you, just-- - Yes or no ? - Don’t pressure me like this. l’m gonna come with you-- l’Il help you out, okay ? They better give me a parade for this. McKAY : What’s going on ? HAEMON : Out. Let’s go. LUCIUS : I’m just spitballing here. What if we hugged each other... ... and the device would, you know, help us with-- SHEPPARD : l don’t like that idea. - l know. SHEPPARD : It’s not possible. - It doesn’t work. Okay, here’s one. What if l swung from a clock tower on a long rope, right into town ? - And ? - l don’t know, that’s all l have. - l could set myself on fire. - l like that. Okay. l could run naked. Oh, l know. l have one. What if l got on your shoulders ? We have a cloak. Some religious thing, they could be afraid of giants. Okay, what if we build a tunnel ? Okay, we could tunnel, or a boulder. A huge boulder. l’m camouflaged, l’m protected. Now the boulder protects you. Or a magnifying glass... - ... and some tape. - l have an idea, Lucius. Some poisoned tape. AMARIS : Lucius. - l knew you’d return to save us. l’ve returned, but you people, you’re gonna have to save yourselves. WOMAN : What ? - You do not wish to help us ? Oh, no, no, of course l wanna help, it’s just-- Look, what if l wasn’t here ? What would you do then ? Wait for you to come back ? All right, there’s the problem. What if l didn’t know that you were in trouble... ... or l couldn’t get back in time ? What would you do ? You’re a great group of people, it’s a lovely town... ... but there’s a lot of horrible people out there... ... so you’ve gotta fend for yourselves. Starting today. WOMAN : l understand what he’s saying. LUCIUS : You do ? By allowing him to assume the responsibility of protecting us... ... we’re surrendering our independence. That’s right. Right ? So in exchange... ... for the convenience of having someone safeguard our town... ... we’re giving up the very part of ourselves we seek to protect. Listen. She’s smart. We need to regain our strength and our independence... ... by taking responsibility for our lives... - ... and the lives of our neighbors. - Yep. After today, we will no longer be dependent on one man. There will be no champion protector, for it will fall to us to protect-- Well, okay, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. You’re getting carried away. Independence is a great thing... ... but so is the comfort of having somebody there... ... to pick up the slack, okay ? You don’t wanna be doing it all the time. You’ve got jobs, or you have hobbies. Beardo here, he likes to fish, right ? You don’t wanna be bothered by having to rise up... ... save the village every day, you know what l mean ? But that’s a thought for another day, okay ? Today, you’re gonna have to fight for yourselves. Okay ? So remember what you said about strength, and integrity... ... and responsibility. So you get out there... ... and you fight for your town. Go to the alleys, spread the word. Now, go. Get out, get out. Okay, yes, rally. Rallying is good. Okay. Get out. MAN : Gather us all together. Gather the mass. Colonel Sheppard ? HAEMON : Maybe he changed his mind. You’re out of time, colonel. Dr. McKay. - Me first. - No, me. - l’Il do it. - l’m-- Well, how positively moving. l almost wish l could shoot you all at once. SHEPPARD : Kolya ! l should’ve killed you when we first met, colonel. - It would have saved me a lot of trouble. - The feeling’s mutual. Goodbye, Sheppard. Well, now that you got that out of your system. Oh, crap. Reload. LUCIUS : Don’t bother. You should have left town when you had the chance. [PEOPLE MURMURING ] MAN : Drop your weapons. l’m sure you’re thinking the same thing right about now. If l gave you the opportunity to surrender, l don’t suppose you’d take it. [CHUCKLES] l didn’t think so. SHEPPARD : Put down your weapons. MAN : Put your hands up. LUCIUS : Sure you can’t stay for some schnitzel ? This is a party for you as much as anybody. SHEPPARD : You guys have a good time. We’re overdue. LUCIUS : Well, thanks for everything. Just remember, stay out of trouble or we’Il be back. Oh, Colonel Sheppard ? - Aren’t you forgetting something ? - Oh, yeah. l did say l’d give that back to you, didn’t l ? Yes, you did. You’re a good man. You’re an honest man. And you made me a better man myself. - You know that, don’t you ? - Good. Bye, Lucius. You said that personal shield was depleted. Oh, yeah. - Then it is worthless ? - Pretty much. BECKETT : You’re not gonna tell Lucius ? - No. LUCIUS : Kick me as hard as you can. Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! SHEPPARD : He’Il figure it out.
