Why don't we bring the Wraith in on this?</i> No. A lot of this new nanite coding is based on his calculations, so maybe...</i> (A) he wouldn't help us, (B) we don't need his help and (C)... someone get me some coffee. You've been silently staring at that board</i> for three hours. - Yeah. It'll come to me. - Just e-mail her, already. Excuse me? Rodney, we're stuck. We've been stuck for ten hours. Just ask her for help, please. - I'm not stuck. - Last time we had a block like this, - she helped us. - Completely different. I cannot sit here waiting for you to have an epiphany! I'm losing the will to live! I suppose there could be more important things I should be working on. However you want to sell it to yourself, that's fine. - Done! - Done!</i> - Just one big cookie? - Yeah. Don't you wanna use your cutters? Nah. I just want a big one. You may wanna flatten the dough a little bit. No. No? Just a giant cookie mountain? That's what you're going for?</i> Okay! - <i>Anything good?</i> - It's from my brother. He's stuck again! Do you mind if I... Yeah, I got this. - Here, do you wanna help with mine? - OK. OK. I want a lot of flour. - How about some more chocolate chips? - But not the full bowl.</i> No, that would be too many. You can't sleep? I thought I heard something. Madison? I don't know. I'm going to check it out. She probably just snuck downstairs for more cookies. That's actually not a bad idea. Drop! You're coming with us. The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams present: Season 4 Episode 09 Miller's Crossing (v. 1.0) Transcription by: swsub.com & Callie Sullivan Timing by: Golgi, Linwelin, Malikay, Obusco, Ricana. Gentlemen. I'm agent Barrett. I work for the NID. Mr. Woolsey has asked me to help you in any way I can. Sorry we didn't meet under better circumstances. Have the kidnappers tried to contact us? - No, I'm afraid not. - I need to get to Vancouver. Okay, the Daedalus is in orbit, so it will be a quick trip. Have you learned any new information yet? No, not yet. The NID is liaising with CSIS on the ground. - They are expecting us. - "C" what, now? Canadian Security Intelligence Services. They're kind of like our CIA. "CSIS"? That the best you guys can do, huh? We will be out in the open, so... Perhaps a change of clothes first? What? I look dumb. It helps you blend in a little. I'm going to stand out no matter what you dress me in. That's a good point. Hey, look. It's your uncle Mer. Hey, lady. You going to say hi? Where's mom? Uh, she's... I told you. She's had to go away for a bit, but she's going to come back soon, okay? Can I... Yeah. Okay, sweetie. - Who did this? - We're not sure, but we have the best people working on this, and all the resources of... When you came back last year, she almost didn't go back with you to Atlantis. I said, "Go, you have to do it. - You'll regret not going." - I know you did. She knew it'd be dangerous, but you two are so competive... - Listen to me. We're going to... - This is your fault, - Hey, just a second. - She got kidnapped because of you. - We do not know that for sure. - <i>We don't?</i> Really? You figure four masked men with guns broke in here to steal her secret apple dumpling recipe? - <i>Jealous neighbor, maybe?</i> - You're angry. - You have every right to be... - If something happens to her... Kaleb. We're going to find her. Just... Bring her back. Bring her home. I will. Come on, Mad. - Where are we going? - Just away for a bit. I told him to get a hotel. There's no reason for them to stick around here. All right, thanks, guys. Give us the room, please. - <i>So, where do you want to start?</i> - Jeanie and I were corresponding by email. She was... - I was bouncing some ideas off her. - What about? Well, before Sheppard's Wraith showed up, I was trying to perfect my nanite medical program. The thing you used to save Weir? Yeah, a better, more complex version of that, but yeah. Of course, as soon as we found out the Replicators were attacking human worlds </i> in the galaxy, we switched our focus to shutting them down once and for all. And you sent Jeanie the program that you were working on? I need a new set of eyes. The question is, what does it have to do with her being taken? Yeah. Maybe the Trust or some other Earth-based organization wanted info on me, or about the Program, but regardless,</i> my email and her capture happened too close together not to be connected. Right. That sounds like a great place to start. - Has anyone touched her computer? - No, I told them you wanted to have a - look at it first. Nobody's touched it. - I'm going to need to take it apart. It'll take some time. Go back to the hotel. - I'll call you if I find anything. - It's okay, we'll stay. Seriously. This could take 10 to 12 hours. There's nothing you can do here. Just go back to the hotel. I'll call you if I find anything.</i> Here. No... Wait, please. It's all right. Let me? Who are you? My name is Henry Wallace. I'm sorry to... I need you to do some work for me. Hello? So, someone was monitoring my sister's computer. I think I've cracked their trojan, and I've got an address. Barrett and I are on our way there now. You said it was going to take 10 hours? Hey, even I underestimate how smart I am sometimes. All right, stay at the house, and then we'll all go together.</i> It's too late, we're almost there. I'll give you an address. You can meet us.</i> Okay, what is it? This looks like the place. Shouldn't we wait for Sheppard and Ronon? Okay... Stand back. Okay, well, that works, too. You don't have another one of those on you? Yeah, I've got a shotgun in the car. You okay? What the hell happened? Two men, they must've been following us. McKay! He's not here. They took him. Meredith? - Jeanie. Thank God you're alive! - What are you doing here? I came back when I heard you'd been kidnapped. - Have you seen Madison and Kaleb? - Yes, they're a little shaken but okay. I've put a security detail, so you don't have to worry. Then how did you... I got ambushed trying to track down the guys who took you. Oh, great. That's just great. First you get me captured and then you... I got you captured? How do you figure that? Come on! They were monitoring my computer, right? - Yeah, so? - So, would I be here - if you hadn't sent me those emails? - Possibly. What is this? A lab? That's some great detective work there, Nancy Drew. - Where the hell are we? - I have no idea. They put me on a plane... Yeah, me too. Any idea who's behind any of this? Dr. McKay. I've heard a lot about you. It's a pleasure. I thought you might show up if your sister went missing. We couldn't count on it, of course, but it's a pretty big bonus. Bonus? I've no idea who you are but you've made a terrible mistake bringing me here. I suggest you let us both go right now, otherwise, about 100 marines are gonna come kicking down - your front door in the next 2 minutes. - I'm pretty sure they won't, actually. Your subcutaneous transmitter has been deactivated. Who are you? I should have started with that. My name is Henry Wallace. - I'm the president of... - DMT. Great. You know who I am, then. I'm familiar with your work. What's DMT? Devlin Medical Technologies. They're a predominantly government-funded contractor,</i> and, unfortunately for us, they manufacture our subcutaneous transmitters. - Great. - Yeah. How do you even know I exist? Your company's only privy to very basic information about newly declassified experiments the military is working on. No, more accurately, my company is given limited access to alien advances discovered through the Stargate Program, and is asked to integrate them into Earth-based medical technologies.</i> - You're not cleared to know that. - No, I'm not. But after years of being stupefied by the military's endless and unbelievable advances, I started to do a little digging. That's how I found out about the SGC, Atlantis, you... And that's why we've been monitoring your family's emails for quite some time now. What do you want from me? I've hit a wall and need some help. My daughter, Sharon. What's wrong with her? She's suffering from acute lymphocytic leukemia. I'm very sorry, but... She's been particularly unresponsive to induction chemotherapy... Prednisone, Vincristine, cranial irradiation... I don't know what all that means. How am I supposed to help? The best doctors in the world have told her to start saying her goodbyes, begin making funeral plans... That's what I'm saying. Neither of us are doctors. I have a PHD, 2 actually... The latest project my company has been working on for the SGC involves applying advances in nanotechnology to cure injury and disease. - We were close to a prototype. - Wait a second. Sharon was injected with the first batch of nanites one week ago. You barely got manufacturing perfected. I'm working on the coding. It's months away! They're not ready! My team thought they had ironed out most of the coding. "Ironed out"? It's not that easy. I know that, now. - They're malfunctioning. - Well, of course they are. And it's not just that they're not working, they're... They're actually causing more problems than the cancer. Her body is rejecting them. When I intercepted your correspondence with Jeanie, I desperately needed someone familiar with the coding to come fix the program. - Right, so Jeanie was just the bait. - No. No. From what I could tell, she had a firmer grasp of the coding than you did. I don't think it's fair to judge me on a couple of emails. They don't reflect... - It doesn't matter. - If we don't do something quickly, Sharon's going to die. Get the nanites fully operational, and I'll let you go. Really? - Absolutely. - And if we don't? That's right, Sir. They must have neutralized the transmitter. What about the lead you were following? Dead end. It's a small, rented room with a router that ported data to a site in Singapore. I mean, who knows where it was forwarded from there. We've got our best IT guys on the job, though. We'll start tracing the paper trail, and hopefully it's gonna turn up a lead. We've combed the security, traffic, and ABM cameras from the area. We've got ambush talking to witnesses... We've got half the Vancouver PD on this one. We're going to get 'em. - They're not communicating. - What? The nanites're causing all the problems, going after some cells redundantly, they're ignoring others, they've caused at least 3 partially clogged arteries... Something in their coding is stopping them from understanding each other.</i> Great. - Are you even listening to me? - You lost me at "nanites." Hey, idiot, we need to solve this coding problem. No, what we need to do is get the hell out of here. I know, by solving the coding problem. - So young, and so naive. - You got a better idea? Yes. Look. They gave these computers network access so we could monitor Sharon in real time, right? Which means I can also hack into the security mainframe. What about Sharon? - What about us? - We can do this. We can help this girl. And then what? He's just going to let us go? He's just going to give up his life, lose his company, get carted off to prison? He'll be fine with that? He's desperate. I think any parent would understand... You think? Let's just for a second imagine that we live in this magical land of unicorns and wizards and kindhearted people who you can take at their word. Let's assume that he lets us go if we save her. What if we fail, huh? What if she dies? How happy do you think he'll be then? He'll just let us waltz out the door with an "aw, shucks, well, better luck next time, tiger" attitude?</i> Exactly. We need to get out of here. I've worked on a code to unlock the keypad doors. You ready? What happens after you get the door open? Well, I memorized the building's layout from this computer here. Okay. Come on. Come. You said there was a stairway entrance here. There's supposed to be. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. We got to go back. - Go back? Why? - Because I got all mixed around. We start again. Maybe what I thought was north was south. Hard to tell. Can't believe I'm betting my life on your sense of direction. - I've an excellent sense of direction. - Remember in West Edmonton Mall dad had to call the police to find you? - That mall is huge! - There are maps every 7 metres! Misleading ones. Now, come on. We got to go back. Oh, man. Oh, shoot. Run! Run! Why would you do that? Why would... My daughter is dying. You kidnapped us. What did you expect? I shouldn't have given you network access. Yeah, well, it's a rookie mistake. You're never going to help me. - Are you? - You're gonna kill us either way. - What exactly is our incentive? - I gave you my word. Which means exactly nothing to me. Please. My wife died three years ago. I can't go through that again. Sharon's all I have. You can save her. Look, this is an experimental medical program. It may never work. All this might've been for nothing. Worst case scenario, I thought I would have weeks with Sharon. Now, if things stay as they are, I'm lucky to have days. You never should have injected her. No. No. It will work. It has to work. What is that? A dose of nanites. - Meredith... - Wait, wait. Please. No. I'm sorry. You need an incentive. Don't! Fix this. Or they both die. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You were right. They're not communicating. They're not doing lots of - things they should be doing, in fact. - Yeah, I know. See, the thing is, even though DMT manufactured their own nanites,</i> the coding, the programming... Most of it's lifted directly from the Replicators. Yeah, well, the thing is, as much as I hate to admit it, we're just beginning to understand that coding. The Wraith we've been working with has helped us... Wait, you've been working with a Wraith? Yeah, it's a long story. What I'm trying to say is this program that we're pushing on it is designed to restrain them... Very specifically, to make sure they don't get out of control. So much so... - They're completely ineffective. - Like we tied their hands. - So we have to cut them loose. - Exactly. The nanites can't replicate. Technically by unleashing them, we might make all our little problems go away. Okay, that shouldn't be too complex. Altering 2,000 maybe 3,000 lines of code. - Yeah, it's a... cinch. - Yeah. - I'm really sorry about all this. - Don't wanna talk about this right now. We need to write this program and upload it. I'll yell at you later, okay? We're going in circles here. I don't even get what we're doing. We're trying to match the corporations. See the company that rented the space for the internet router was owned by another company which was owned by another and owned by another. Trying to connect the company that was monitoring Jeanie's computer to a company that would want to take her.</i> Probably a company owned by the trust. We just haven't found a connection. They knew enough to shut down the transmitter.</i> Exactly. You know, the fact that they even knew that tells us that they're pretty intimate with the operations of the Stargate Program. Again, the Trust. We should widen the net. Maybe it wasn't one of them. Other known enemy groups? - Or an ally. - Chinese? Russians? McKay said he was working on a program which shut down the Replicators. Was he working in tandem with anyone here on Earth? No. No, not that I know of. Wait. There was a medical company that was working on other nanite programs but they didn't have any direct dealings with him. Which company was that? I don't know. Give me a sec. I'll find out. - Where are you going? - Get some food. In case you forgot, McKay and his sister are still missing. What? You want my help dissecting corporate structures? When you find someone to point a gun at, you let me know. Fair enough. What's it been? A couple of hours? Something like that. So, what? No updates? I mean, I know we're hostages and all, but, come on... took me like 10 sec to upload the program. - What's taking so much time? - It'll take a while to figure out if our coding patch makes the nanites fight the cancer. When we activated them in Weir, she was healed almost instantly. That time, the replicator cells actually replaced her damaged cells. Our guys have to heal them. But still, by now they should have seen a massive changes in her condition. - Why aren't they telling us anything? - Sit down. You're driving me crazy. - Are you gonna marry that Katie girl? - What? - You heard me. - Where did that come from? I'm trying to take my mind off the fact I have tiny robots running through my veins 'cause you need help with your homework. You'd rather talk about that? Not really. - Are you going to marry her? - I don't know. You've been dating for over a year now. I'm aware of that, thank you. - You think you'll find someone better? - No, it's not that. 'Cause you're not. Hang on. The fact that you've found a nice girl who's willing to put up with all your many little flaws is a miracle. - Look. - Plus, physically, you're... Well, how do I put this? You're no John Sheppard. Okay. Let's go back to talking about how it's my fault, I think I liked that better. Come with me. Oh, come in, come in. Sharon, I want to introduce you to Rodney McKay, Jeanie Miller. They're the ones that saved you. It's very nice to meet you. Thank you so much. How are you feeling? Better than I've felt in years. And the cancer? We can't find any trace of it. And I'm nervous, right? Because, you know, it's an admiral I'm talking to,</i> so I say to him, "Sir, if you use an I37 form instead of an N1,</i> you can save yourself from using, like, like, like, a hundred G72s," and there's this pause. No one says anything for, like, I don't know, felt like minutes, and, finally, the admiral looks over at Landry and he goes, "Hank. not only is your boy here right, but I think we found ourselves a new bingo caller for sunday nights." Bingo! God! "I37!" "N1!" "G72!" Bingo! Who ever said the admiral didn't have a sense of humor? Then there was this other time that general O'Neill and I, - we were... - Tell me you have something. - Devlin Medical Technologies. - That means? - We got somebody to point your gun at. - Sweet. - What are you going to do with us? - Hey! We're celebrating here. She's still got nanites inside her, and we're both still hostages, so you'll excuse me if I skip the champagne. I'm a man of my word. - I'm going to let you go. - What, just like that? Just like that. - But you'll be arrested. - Not helping. I know. I've known I was going to prison from the moment I decided to kidnap you. I don't care. My daughter's going to live. That's all that matters. - I can't expect you to understand. - You're right, I don't. We've done a great thing here today. And not just for my daughter. Hell, we might have just cured cancer altogether.</i> So, please, a toast. To the future. Sir, we have a problem. Clear! Nothing. Going again. Charging. Clear! Turn it off. I'm so sorry. She was fine. - I don't understand. - Her heart just stopped. We couldn't get it pumping again. I'm not sure what happened. - We need to get out of here. - I know. I need to get you back to the SGC. Your nanites are running on the same programming. Okay. I'm going to see if I can distract the guard, I need you to go. Jeanie? What are you doing? I'm so sorry. My brother and I need to leave. We need to get to a bigger lab with more scientists. Please. I don't know what to do. I can't imagine what you're going through right now. I know you're angry. I would be, too, but... If I go untreated... Look, I have a family, a husband, a daughter. Please. I need to get help, and I can't do it here. I'm sorry. - You said she was dead. - She was. The nanites are still active. Once they've beaten the cancer, they're supposed to shut themselves down. Never been tested in a live subject, only worked sporadically in simulations. Look, I told you, this programming is nowhere near ready to implement. Wait, you're saying the nanites brought her back to life? It's the only viable explanation. Then why did she die in the first place? Shouldn't they have kept her alive? - It's a good point. - Wait. The doctor said her heart just stopped? Seemingly out of nowhere? Right. Does Sharon have any heart problems? Unrelated to the cancer? Yes, she has a mitral regurgitation problem. Heart murmur. - What, you don't think... - We broadened the parameters. They weren't just programmed to cure the cancer. Once they were done with leukemia, they moved on to heart, - easiest way to fix that... - Shut it down while they repaired. That doesn't make any sense. Shutting down the heart</i> and starving the brain of oxygen would cause severe brain damage. - Damage they could technically fix. - They could repair the tissue, yes, but the patient would lose their memories, their language skills,</i> - any sense of self. - They don't care about that. Look, they were designed to fix the body of all physical maladies. I mean, preserving a sense of self isn't one of their directives. So... She's going to be stuck in this vegetative state? Technically, her brain is perfectly healthy. It's like she's been reset to zero, so to speak. Meredith. What about me? I don't have any cancer. They'll look around and go straight for... Your epilepsy. I don't wanna be shut down for repairs. Okay, okay, the first thing we got to do is... - You guys okay? - <i>How...</i> We need to get Jeanie to the SGC! Is the Daedalus still in orbit? You're welcome. It was a daring rescue. Thanks, but we're not out of the woods. We have to get to the SGC now! Daedalus, this is Sheppard. We need a lift. Okay, I've put Jeanie in a medically induced coma, and I've broken her legs. You what? We need to slow down the nanites. This could buy us 10 hours, at least. You broke her legs? Couldn't you give her a disease? She need an immediate and severe trauma. Besides, if we shut them down before she's properly healed, all she has is a few broken bones. Instead of a disease she'd have to fight alone. Exactly. I'm pretty sure we can't just keep doing this. Sooner or later, the nanites are gonna abandon her broken bones and move to her brain, so we need to move fast. Can't we just blast her with an electromagnetic pulse? These nanites were designed specifically to be immune to EM field fluctuations. - Wonderful. - So we have 10 hours to come up with - a program that shuts down the nanites? - Right. So what's the plan? Well, as embarrassing as I find this to say... I need some help. This was a bad idea. Yeah, well, it's the only one I've got. Why have you brought me here? Look, you understand the replicator coding better than anyone.</i> If we're going to do this quickly, then we need your help. And why should you care? We're gonna kill you either way. That's what you're thinking? Okay. So, incentives... First off, we have no interest in killing you. You've probably already figured that out by now, but we can't let you go, either, because you know too much about Atlantis. Unless you could prove you're trustworthy... And this would go a long way towards proving that.</i> Right. Yeah, pretty sure I wouldn't buy that either. Do you have any relatives? Do Wraith have brothers or sisters? I don't know how it works... But with us, with my people, those bonds mean a lot. My sister is in trouble, and it's pretty much all my fault. You could help us. You could save her. That doesn't mean anything to you, does it? I suppose it wouldn't mean much to me, either, if I was in your place. You and I both know that if we can figure out how to shut down these earth-made nanites, it would be a giant step toward shutting down the Replicators. I know you lost your hive. I have no idea how horrible that must have been for you, but knowing they're still out there, that you alone could do something, that's got to be driving you crazy. So don't do this for me, don't do this for my sister... Do this for yourself. Do this because you know you can, and because you know it'll help destroy the Replicators once and for all. What do you say? Thank you. All right, there's a few bugs to code out, but I think we're close. We? Hey, I have been contributing. Now, if I could suggest a few, targets... Are you okay? No. What if he's faking? Maybe he's just milking it for a hot meal. No, I believe him. He can't finish the coding without feeding. I understand exactly what he's doing, but he's far more versed at implementing it than I am. Maybe if I had a couple of weeks, but he's the only one who can do it in a day. I don't know what to say, but the NID is not gonna provide us with a human for him to feed on. I know. It needs to be me. What? I want him to feed on me. You wanna what? Let him feed off me, get his strength back, then he can finish the coding and save Jeanie. Then what? Force him to give you your life back? - He's not gonna do that. - Sharon died. Half an hour ago. I don't understand. What happened? I thought the nanites would... This time it wasn't a problem with the programming. It was a manufacturing defect. Look, in Layman's terms, the nanites ran out of steam while they were repairing her arteries. She bled out internally. There was nothing we could do. I can't lose my sister, John. How am I gonna explain that to her husband? To her kid? That Wraith'll kill you. - That's my choice to make. - No, it's not. You're an invaluable member of my team, and you report directly to me. You wanna talk about chain of command? - You are not doing this. - She's here because of me. I can't fix the problem, but I can help the guy who can. Look, this was not an easy decision to make. - I can't. - Please. I'm sorry. We're going over the data. We don't understand what happened. I'm sorry. And Jeanie? She's not gonna make it. We brought in a... specialist from the Pegasus galaxy. Part of an enemy race called the Wraith. Somehow, McKay has convinced him to create a program to shut down the nanites in Jeanie's body. And? He was close, real close, but he hasn't fed in a few weeks, so he collapsed. He's too weak to finish the coding modifications. I don't understand. If it means saving her life, why not just feed him? Well, he feeds on... humans. Their life force. I see. Little hard to find volunteers. - So Jeanie will... - She's going to die. Just like Sharon. I'm so sorry. I'm sure you are. This is Kaleb, her husband... And, Madison, her little daughter. I never meant for any of this to happen. I know you didn't... But it did. Now McKay's blaming himself. I know better. You know better. Come on. - Can I help you, Sir? - No. No problem. May I see that, Sir? - No, you may not. - Sir. The card, please. - You're not Dr. Lee, Sir. - Was that lee's card? You know, we were just at the gym, and must have swapped pants, so, - would you just open the door for me? - Not without a card, Sir. I'm Dr. Rodney mcKay. This is my lab. Would you please open the door? - I can't do that, sir. - This is a matter of life or death. Open the door! I'm under... - Sheppard? - Let him in. - What... - I was showing Wallace the labs. The Wraith got the upper hand. That's what the report's going to say. You... - Come on. You've got work to do. - No, he does not. I have completed the reprogramming. That was quick. Well, get it uploaded. - Jeanie? - Mer... It's okay. It's okay. Man... Medical comas are weird. Yeah, well, you're not the first to mention it. - Did you... - Yes. So I... I'm... You are absolutely fine. I mean, aside from a few inert nanites in you. Thanks, Mer. You know... I'm really sorry about all this. Oh, I am going to hold this over your head for... Forever. - It's totally fair. - Like, you're going to eat a lot of vegetarian food and not complain about it. Sure. Sure. And you're going to read Madison 3 stories instead of her usual 2... All right. You're going to buy me a car. - Let's not get out of control here. - You almost got me killed. That's at least a car. A nice one. - A hybrid. - We'll talk about it on the way home. Home... that sounds great. I love you. Yeah. I love you too. - Hey. - Hey. Look who's back. How's the family? It was great. I bought them a Prius. - Guilt. - Yeah. Listen... - I can't believe what you did. - I don't really want to talk about it. You talked Wallace into sacrificing himself. No, I didn't. - Well, then how did he... - I... I presented a situation. He volunteered. Still, you talked a man into killing himself. He wanted to make things right. I merely... Presented the situation? Yeah. Thanks. Want to get something to eat? Sure. Say... You and I are about even when it comes to looks, right? - Who's been lying to you?
