l think that’s exactly the point, actually. The ways of my people are different. - l’d never-- - He’s not gonna make the first move. We shall see. Look, you know him better than l do-- l would hope so. - -but l wouldn’t be surprised if he was oblivious to the situation. - It bears no further discussion. - All right. If you want someone to drop hints-- You remember the last time so many people had the day off ? Yeah, it’s all Heightmeyer’s doing. She insisted that the brass order some sort of mandatory rest day. l guess down time here doesn’t really happen organically. Hey, and don’t think l haven’t realized you’ve changed the subject. My people have a day of rest every four nights. - Now that is civilized. - Yes. - Hey, wanna grab a late lunch ? - l would like that. l forgot my bantos rods at the gym. - Can l meet you there ? - Sure. - Hi. - Hi. - What are you doing here ? - l work here. But it’s our day off. - Shouldn’t you be enjoying it, then ? - l got behind on my research this week. Just wanted to drop off some results for the next Earth transmission. Great. Good. l was thinking about grabbing some food. Care to join ? - l can’t, l’ve-- - You’re not capable of having lunch ? - Yes, l’m capable. - Are you planning on eating today ? - Of course. - Great. Eat with me. Look, it’s nothing personal but... l make a point of not having relationships with people who work for me. l don’t work for you. l’m your boss. Well, you’re my boss’boss, actually. Still, however indirectly... Yeah, but with that thinking, everyone on this planet works for you. - You won’t be friends with any of them ? - Friends is one thing. Oh, you think-- Oh, wait. l see what’s happening here. You think l’m asking you out on a date. No, no, no. This isn’t a date. This is lunch. This is the mandatory refueling of our bodies. This is putting food in your mouth, chewing it, having something... ... more engaging than a wall sitting across from you. That’s all it is. Come on. You gotta admit : l’m more appealing than a wall, no ? No, you don’t have to admit it but it’d be a massive blow to my ego... ... if you thought otherwise. You are more appealing than a wall. Great. Now, what say we go grab some grub ? - l still have an hour of work to do-- - An hour, then. l’Il see you in the mess hall. Élizabeth, you’re early. Just give me a moment. How set on lunch were you today ? Why ? Well, something’s come up. Surely whatever work it is you feel you must get done can wait. l was invited to lunch by Mike Branton. Oh, really ? - You and l, we had plans-- - My friend, Dr. Hewston radioed me. She wants me to teach her some bantos fighting this afternoon... ... so do not worry. l will have something to occupy my time. Okay. - Are you sure ? - Yes. Okay. Hello. Oh, don’t you look lovely. Thank you, Carson. It’s the first time l’ve seen you out of your uniform in quite some time. No, l don’t know about that. - Off somewhere special ? - No, just getting some lunch. Rodney and l are going fishing on the mainland. l know, l cleared the use for the Jumper. Care to join us ? Who knows what kind of fish we’Il find ? That’s very kind but some other time. What ? Do you have a hot date ? What ? Who told you that ? No one. l was joking. l was right. Who is it ? None of my business. - Have a lovely afternoon, Élizabeth. - Thank you. - You smell good too. - Shut up. - You believe that ? - Yes. - Truly and in your heart ? - l do. What ? l don’t know that l can ever respect you again. Come on. You think <i>When Harry met Sally</i> is better than <i>Annie Hall ?</i> You’re crazy. It is. When Harry met Sally is essentially a remake... ... a cheap imitation, a bad cover-song version of <i>Annie Hall</i>. - You realize that, right ? - l disagree. l know you do, but that’s what makes you crazy. l guess this will never work out. - This ? - Lunch. Now... ... does that mean that you don’t believe that men and women can be friends ? - l never said that. - You didn’t have to say it. Any lady that likes <i>When Harry met Sally</i> thinks men and women... - ... can’t be friends. - Fine. Maybe l do. So where does that leave me ? l guess that leaves you at lunch. - Come on. - Where ? If lunch is all l get, l’m going to get as much bang for my buck as possible. - It really is beautiful here, isn’t it ? - Yeah. All done ? All done. l guess lunch is over. l guess it is. l should have brought dessert. It would have lasted longer. l should really get back anyway. What are you doing tomorrow ? - Mike-- - No, l like you... ... and l’m extremely charming. l’d like to see you spin those into negatives. - l don’t think-- - Probably best you don’t think. Would you stop interrupting me ? - You have a tendency to do that. - l do not. Yes, you do. l hate it when people interrupt me. Well, if l hadn’t interrupted you we would never have had lunch. Life needs a little interrupting every now and again. All right, l don’t completely disagree. Was that way out of line ? l can’t do this. - Just because we work together ? - This would split my focus. - Give it a chance, see if it-- - l’m sorry. l-- l shouldn’t have done this in the first place. l thought l-- Dr. Weir, please report to the control room immediately. What’s going on ? An explosion at the base of the tower near the gym. Early reports have at least three dead and a dozen or so severely injured. Explosion ? Was there an equipment malfunction ? We’re going over the data logs but it wasn’t a malfunction. So it could have been a bomb ? Oh, hey, there you are. Been looking all over for you. What, you forget ? - No. - You forgot. You were going to teach Ronon and myself how to play golf. That’s the plan. l’m afraid l have made other plans. - What other plans ? - Having lunch with Élizabeth. Well, you still got time. Yes, true. However, l’m afraid l have been quite delinquent... ... in filing my mission reports. l had hoped to get caught up before l met with Élizabeth. - Okay. - If you would like, l could cancel-- No. No. No. She could use a little time out of the office. Some other time. Some other time. You know, John, l got mission reports too. Nice try. It’s gonna be fun. Fun ? Nice shot. Thank you, Jim. It was pretty nice, though, huh ? So that’s the sport ? You just hit a little ball as far as you can ? First, it’s a game, and, no, it’s a little more complicated than that. See, there are 18 holes, all made up of varying lengths and dimensions. First goal is to hit the ball through water and sand hazards... ... till you land on the green. Then you putt the ball into the hole. So this is a water hazard ? Well, we don’t have a course yet. All we have is a driving range... - ... where you-- - Just hit a little ball ? Pretty much, yeah. What’s so hard about that ? Well, l make it look easy but l’ve been playing since l was 6. So although it seems simple... ... developing a sweet swing like mine takes years-- Like that ? - That was okay. - Okay ? You can’t see where it landed. Well, it’s not a distance game, it’s an accuracy one. Pick a spot, l’Il hit it there. First off, your grip : It’s all wrong. Oh, yes, of course. There you are. l wanted see you. l’ve been having this weird pain-- Hold on, sorry. Let me stop you there. It’s the first day l’ve had off in a month. Dr. Cole is in the infirmary and would be glad to help you. - Okay. Fair enough. - Right. What’s up, Carson ? - Fishing. - What ? Rodney and l are heading to the mainland to catch a fish that’s like a trout. Care to join us ? Sport of kings. l thought horse racing was the sport of kings. For the boring kings, maybe. Carson, you’re Scottish. This is your game. - Wouldn’t you rather be on the range ? - It was never my thing. Come on, last chance. l think we’re gonna pass. All right. Don’t be jealous when l return with a record-breaking space trout. Thank you. - We’Il try to contain ourselves. - Oh, aye. Time for a real sport. Come on. - Grab the other guy’s flag ? That’s it ? - That’s it. - No penalties and stuff ? - What ? Well, if the other guy pulls your hair or tries to bite you ? Bite back. Right. - You ready ? - Ready as l’Il ever be. - That’s one for me. - Two out of three. - Round 2 : one-handed. - What ? After every round, the level of difficulty is increased. It’s to simulate battle : After an encounter, the possibility of injury. Round 2 : one-handed. Let me get better at Round 1 before we move on to the harder part ? Okay. Round 2. - It’s two for me. - Three out of five. You know, l could do this all day. Haven’t even broken a sweat yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Round 3. Oh, come on. Oh, you are making this stuff up. This is not a traditional Satedan sport. This is an excuse to make me look dumb and kick my ass. If you wanna quit... Sorry. - This game sucks. - You need to focus. l don’t know if that’s going to be possible again. Here, help me get up. l got an idea. It hurts, doesn’t it ? - Like that ? - Yeah, you gotta hit it... - ... straight on, hard as you can. - Okay. This is what l’m talking about. This is how you spend a day off : Kick back, eat some junk food, listen to some tunes. You like this music ? What ? You don’t ? It’s fine. l’m gonna stick to golf. Your game’s a little too much like my day job. So, how long have you been here now ? A year ? - Year and a half. - Year and a half ? You ever hang out with anyone else besides me and Teyla ? l’m not saying we’re sick of you or anything. l don’t know. Are you dating anyone ? You mean like a woman ? Or a man ? No. l’m not ready yet. Not ready yet ? Did you leave somebody behind on Sateda ? Wife ? Close enough. Sorry. What about you ? Yeah, what about me ? When are you getting married ? l’ve already done that. Not very good at it. Besides there really isn’t anyone here that-- Yeah, you know... See, l always thought you and Teyla would-- You know... - Really ? - Yeah. Why not ? Bright lights. Go, move. All right, let’s get these two to the O.R. right away. - What happened here ? - An explosion. At least three dead, a dozen or so injured. Doc ? Oh, Lord. Teyla. - She gonna be okay, doc ? - She’s lost a great deal of blood. - Get her to the infirmary, stat. - Is she gonna be all right ? Let’s go. Let’s move. - What happened here, Radek ? - There was an explosion. - l get that, but why ? - l’m not sure yet. l wasn’t allowed in till the crews cleared the floor. - What took you so long ? - Transporters are down. - Lots of stairs. - McKay’s in his lab. Might have a lead. - What kind of lead ? - He didn’t say. The good news is the structure is intact so there’s no danger of the tower falling. - There is, however, something very odd. - What ? The few eyewitness reports that we have... ... say Dr. Hewston just blew up. - What does that mean ? - Is that even possible ? Normally l’d agree but from what we can tell... ... she was standing in the hall and just exploded. So what ? Suicide bomb ? That’s what l thought too originally, but l’ve scanned the area... ... and there isn’t even the slightest trace of explosive residue. We’ve no idea what we’re dealing with here. l’m a pretty easy guy to work for. l am usually too busy doing all the really important stuff... ... to micromanage the things l need you to be doing. Because of that, you have a fair amount of freedom. That does not mean you can do whatever you please. There are rules, there are protocols, not only to protect the city... ... but your sorry little existences. - If l could just-- - You cannot. You cannot interrupt me. l was having a wonderful dream before l got this call. You can stand there and listen. You were sent on a routine cataloging of one of the abandoned Ancient labs... ... and you activate a device without having a clue what it was ? - We thought it was a-- - Yes. You thought wrong. But the other week you did the same, so l don’t-- But l am me. If l make a mistake, l can fix it. You are you. And when you make mistakes, you don’t have to fix them. l do. The second we realized it was emitting radiation, we turned it off. So what ? What, you want a medal ? My 4-year-old niece could too if it was emitting radiation. That does not make you smart that just makes you a little less stupid. Rodney, be nice. So ? Are they gonna live ? More importantly, can l go back to bed ? According to the scan and tests, they’Il be all right. You should check back in 24 hours. We’Il run more tests to be certain. You were lucky because we are in a place where flipping a switch... ... could domino out into thousands of people dying. You need to be more careful. Okay. - Take tomorrow off, all right ? - We already have tomorrow off. It’s the mandatory rest day. It is ? Already ? Oh, great. Katie ? Hello ? Katie ? - Rodney. - There you are. - What are you doing here ? - What are you doing here ? Well, l’m nursing these little baby ferns we found on M4L-279. At this stage, they’re very fragile and if l leave them too long... - ... they’Il die. - So what ? They’re ferns. Oh, which is to say, you need time off, just like everyone else does. l know, it’s just-- They produce this enzyme that might cure leukemia. - What ? These guys ? Really ? - Yeah. What are you doing with your day off ? You had plans. Oh, l do with Beckett. That’s kind of why l’m here. Yeah, l need an excuse to break those plans. - Why’s that ? - Because we’re going fishing. And to be honest, l cannot think of a more torturous way... ... of spending a day than up to my hips in water, getting worms on hooks... ... and having all the time to listen to Carson’s views... ... on what l’m sure are a vast number of impossibly boring subjects. l mean, it is unappealing in every way. Why did you say yes in the first place ? He said,« ou » ?You wanna go fishing next month ? » It sounded far. Something could come up, l’d be able to get out of it. - Here we are a month later-- - Nothing’s come up. Exactly. So if l told him we finally had an afternoon where l could... ... take you out to lunch or something... ... then he’d have no choice. l can’t. l need to baby-sit the ferns. Right. Well, if l had a nickel for every time a girl used that line... You know what ? Let me bring lunch to you. - We can eat here. - You wanna baby-sit ferns with me ? In the battle between ferns versus fish, ferns win a decisive victory. - That would be lovely. - Great. Okay. l’Il be right back. Okay. Would you look at that ? Great minds think alike. - l thought l’d pick us up snacks as well. - Yes. About that. - Rodney. - Here’s the thing. - You know l’d love to go with you. - l don’t. l would. l do. l just ran into Katie Brown. She laid the guilt on... ... how l never see her, how the one day l get off... ... l’m off to the coast to fish with my best buddy. She and l see so little of each other. Not sure we count as a couple. Look. - Long story short. - Too late. l told Katie l would spend the day with her. - All right. - If it was anybody else-- No, no, l understand. Yeah, next week. l’m 100 percent there. - You promise ? - Absolutely. - Okay. - It’s still early. - l’m sure you’Il find someone else. - You can bet on that. Well, tell Katie l said hello. - Will do. - Enjoy. l will. Yes. This is lovely. It is, yes. l got to say, after all the Cadman craziness last year... ... l figured there was no chance for us. - Why’s that ? - You had another consciousness... ... in your body, one that took over during our first date... ... and made you kiss me. l mean, it was awkward. - So you ignored me for a few months. - l did not. Yeah. Yes, you did. l mean, it’s okay, l guess. l can’t imagine going through that... ... and l wouldn’t wanna be reminded of it either. Yes, well, it was a little weird there for a bit. For the last little while... ... you’ve really made an effort to make time for me. And it has been lovely. It’s funny, you know ? As much as l hate to admit it, seeing my little sister so happy... ... with her family, l just-- Well, it kind of made me realize that-- Well... ... l’d like to get married. You would ? Oh, no. Not to you. Oh, no, no, no. Not to you. l was-- That was not a proposal. l was just... - ... talking. - Right. Don’t get the wrong-- It’s not l wouldn’t be interested in getting married... ... to someone like you. Just like you. You even maybe. One day. l just-- l know, l know. It’s okay. l like you a lot. l mean, l do. l know you do and l like you a lot too. l know. And to be honest, l find that just baffling. - Come on. - No, no, no. Other people find it baffling too. l guess they don’t know you like l know you. But that’s what scares me. l mean, you’Il know me the way they know me-- l think l know you pretty well. There’s not a lot of subtext with you. l am really sorry... ... that l ignored you all that time. l bet you are. - What was that ? - l don’t know. Look, l gotta go. So what ? Suicide bomb ? That’s what l thought too originally, but l’ve scanned the area... ... and there isn’t even the slightest trace of explosive residue. l’ve no idea what we’re dealing with here. -Zelenka, do you read ? - Yes, l’m here with Sheppard and Ronon. - What have you got ? -You’re all gonna wanna see this. All right. l’m digesting this as l go, so forgive the rough edges. - What do you got ? - Now, last night... ... Dr. Hewston and her partner, Dr. Watson... ... were cataloging a new Ancient lab we uncovered. They inadvertently activated this machine. It started to emit a very odd type of radiation... ... but they were able to turn it off right away. Dr. Beckett examined them and gave them a clean bill of health. So with no immediate, apparent danger... ... we decided to figure out what the device was... ... whenever we had time. - That was a mistake. - What is it ? Well, the science of it is-- Well, it’s spectacularly complicated. It appears to be a weapon created by the Ancients to battle the Wraith. One that was abandoned fairly early on as it affected everyone in proximity... - ... including Ancients and humans. - Affected them how ? Well, long story short, it creates explosive tumors. - Explosive tumors ? - What ? - Are you kidding me ? - Yeah, l wish. Look. It’s actually ingenious. Look, the device emits millions of irradiated particles... ... genetically programmed to enter our systems and gather behind the lungs. Now, as they go, they collect trace elements... ... from our body that they need to complete an explosive compound... ... which, once in place, the tumor reaches critical mass and explodes. - Wait. This guy, Watson-- - Has been exposed. Find him before the tumor ignites, which could be any minute now. It’s not good but not awful. We need to start right away. What’s his name ? James. James Watson. Next week, l am 100 percent there. - You promise ? - Absolutely. - Okay. - It’s still early. - l’m sure you’Il find someone else. - You can bet on that. Well, tell Katie l said, hello. - Yeah. Will do. - Enjoy. l will. - Son of a bitch. Stop that. - Stop what ? Winning ? - You haven’t won yet. - Carson. - Come to join the chess club ? - Not quite. - You’ve come to watch ? - Well... ... no, actually, l’m looking for someone to come fishing with me. Rodney bailed. - Surprise, surprise. - l know. Any interest ? l would but we’re playing for trades today. No one can really beat me, so-- l’ve won a desk fan... ... Dr. Mallozzi’s anime DVD collection... ... and coupon for a Swedish massage from Dr. Ambrose. - Perhaps we can go fishing next week ? - Okay, all right, best of luck to you. Oh, l don’t need luck. - Checkmate. - Son of a bitch. - You paint ? - Hey, doc. Yeah. l paint. And you’re good too. My mom was an art teacher. It’s what we did on weekends. l stopped for a while. Didn’t have time during basic training... ... and the first couple of years on duty... ... but l’ve been picking it up again. Hard not to, with views like that. Aye. l don’t suppose there’s any chance you’d like to come fishing with me ? If you’d got to me earlier, maybe, but l kind of want to finish this up. It looks done to me. That is why l am the painter and you are the doctor. Very good point. Enjoy the rest of your day, major. Oh, you can count on it. - Oh, hey there, sir. - Hello. l was-- You know what’s crazy ? l was just thinking about you. Does that ever happen to you ? You’re thinking about something, and boom, there it is. It’s not that l’m psychic but who knows ? - Well, actually-- - You know what ? l am sorry. You were trying to say something and l interrupted you. Enjoy your day off, Dr. Biro. Absolutely. Bye-bye. Slow day ? Carson. What are you doing here ? It’s your day off. My fishing trip is a bust so l figured l’d come here... ... and catch up on some paperwork for the first time. - Well, that’s a shame. - Aye, it is. - You all right ? - A migraine. It’s a bad one, actually. l took some stuff... ... but l can’t take any more, being the on-call and everything. - You should have radioed me. - You kidding ? No way. You’ve been talking about that fishing trip for two weeks. l’m not going now, so off you go. l’Il cover your shift. - You sure ? - Aye, there’s nothing happening here. You go take a horse pill and rest. Oh, you’re a lifesaver. - l know. - Thanks, Carson. Thanks. You’re welcome. If you’re going to play volleyball, you’re going to need proper gym shoes. l know. l’ve put an order. It takes forever to get things from Earth... ... that aren’t vital to the success of the missions. You, young lady, are vital to the success of the missions... - ... so don’t play sports in sandals, okay ? - Okay, doc. All right, we’re all done here. We’Il fix you up some crutches and-- Meyers, call in every nurse and doctor immediately. You, grab two field kits and a couple of stretchers and follow me. Beckett. What happened ? Where do you need me ? - What happened here ? - An explosion. At least three dead, a dozen or so injured. Doc ? Teyla. - Carson. - l’m here. You’ve been in an explosion. A piece of debris has impacted your side. We’Il take it out and patch you up. Easy-peasy. l can do this one in my sleep. All right, all set ? Thank you. Can’t believe you got the artery cleaned. They don’t make you head surgeon if you’re all thumbs. You have another patient waiting. He got his leg cut up bad. We’re done here. Let’s get her to recovery and get him in. - Okay. - Long story short... ... it creates explosive tumors. Explosive tumors ? - Are you kidding me ? - l wish l was. - Wait. This guy Watson-- - Has been exposed. Find him before the tumor ignites, which could be any minute now. It’s not good but not awful. We need to start right away. What’s his name ? James, James Watson. Watson ? Poor lad was in here last night. He’s had a run of bad luck. Dr. Watson, Dr. James Watson, report your whereabouts immediately. Well, aren’t you popular ? Go see what that’s about, please. He’s in the O.R. right now ? l need you to get Beckett back on his radio. It’s Dr. McKay. - What is it ? l’m a little busy right now. -Carson. The man has been infected with an explosive tumor. It killed Hewston, caused the explosion. - What are you talking about ? That’s-- - <i>It is possible, Carson.</i> You need to get you and your team out of there. An ordnance disposal crew is on the way. He’s too fragile to move now. He doesn’t have to move. You do. Listen up. l need everyone to clear the floor right now. l’m enacting a Protocol 7 for this level. Move it, people. Right, he stays, you go. - What about you ? - l’m staying put. - So am l. - No time to fight about this. - You can’t do this on your own. - Oh, God. Thank you. All right, let’s get the scanner in place... ... we have a tumor to remove. He’s used his authorization code to seal off the whole level. We can’t get to him. Carson, you cannot seriously be considering operating on this guy. Exactly how much time do l have ? There is no way to know for sure. Hewston was infected at the same time that Watson was. Her tumor’s exploded. No time to waste, then. making first incision. Okay, this is all very brave and all, but-- What if the explosion causes structural damage ? - What if the tower comes down ? - Exactly. Sending him to the other side of the city and leaving him is tantamount to murder. The man is already dead. - Like hell he is. -Carson. - l can’t order you to stand down, but-- - <i>That’s right, you can’t.</i> Have your men standing by. l’Il open the access once l’ve extracted the tumor. Beckett out. - How long has he been at it ? - Ten minutes. Emergency crew’s standing by. Either way, we’re covered. - Can’t you bypass his code ? - That’Il take half an hour. - If he’s not done removing it by then-- - This is crazy. Colonel Sheppard, l’ve extracted the tumor... ... and l’m opening up the O.R. level. He’s on his way. Sit tight. - Damn it. Tell him l’Il meet him half way. -Just stay put, doc. The sooner l get this thing out of my sight, the better. You finish closing him up, please. l’Il be right back. Easy. Easy. Thank you. We just made the handoff. Hey. Hey. You okay ? Not really. - You need some help ? - No. l’m almost done. He didn’t have a lot of stuff here. - You sending it all back to his family ? - Yeah. Well, l mean, we-- We will. They don’t know yet. We’re going to send... ... the body... ... back to Earth, and... l’m gonna tell his mother. - l should have just gone fishing with him. - Don’t. No, if l’d gone fishing... ... if l’d checked the machine, hadn’t assigned junior guys-- Rodney. What’s done is done. l know. And... ... that’s what’s killing me. - Where do you think you’re going ? - l’d like to go to the memorial. l don’t think you should be going anywhere. l’m fine. All right. - l’Il get a wheelchair. - No. l would like to stand. As a testament to him. How are you doing ? Me ? Fine, but l didn’t get major surgery two days ago. That is not what l meant. Well, it hasn’t hit me yet. l’m not looking forward to it when it does. l feel a great sadness. He-- l feel a great sadness. Yeah, l got you. We’ve said goodbye to a lot of friends today. Our mission is a dangerous one. We lose people. A fact we’re all painfully aware of. But Carson was... l can’t remember anyone coming to me with a complaint against him. Ever. He was a kind soul. He was... He was a healer... ... and he will be very deeply missed. George Fabricius said : « Death comes to us all... ... but great achievements... ... they build a monument which shall endure... ... until the sun grows cold. » Every single life Carson saved... ... is a monument to him. And that gives me great comfort. How’d it go back on Earth ? It was-- It was awful. Your family was amazing, though. Aye, they are. Good turnout ? Packed the church. Oh, that’s good to hear. It’s not gonna be the same here without you. Oh, you’re telling me... You know... ... universe is a big place. Who knows ? Maybe we’Il... - ... bump into each other again. - Aye. Who knows ? You were the closest thing to a best friend that l ever had. l’m really, really sorry. - l should have just-- - Hey. This isn’t your fault. You’re telling me what l wanna hear. Well, that’s what best friends do sometimes. And in this case, it also happens to be true. Take care of yourself, Rodney. Goodbye, Carson.
