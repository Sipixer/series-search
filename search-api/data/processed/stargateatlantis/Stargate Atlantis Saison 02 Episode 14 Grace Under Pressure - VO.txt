will eventually be considered misguided? - 'cause that would bother me. - I'm sorry? Well, given enough time, everything's pretty much proven wrong, right? No. Everything from the earth being flat to the sun revolving around us. Well, if you want to go back hundreds of years... scientists get it wrong more times than they get it right. Take the tomato. Excuse me? Well, after the conquest of Mexico in 1519, tomatoes were carried eastward to europe, where they were believed to be poisonous. Shouldn't you be concentrating on what you're doing? I got it covered. You worry about you. I am worried about me. This is first flight this thing has had since it was shot down and repaired. It deserves all of your attention. It made it to the mainland. If anything was going to go wrong, it would have gone wrong by now. It took the italians and the spaniards to realize that tomatoes are, in fact, delicious. Good for them. Columbus was spanish, he figured out the earth was round. He was italian. So I wonder what it is that makes spaniards so good at debunking bad science. You're not spanish, are you? Oh, yes, of the Barcelona McKays. Now, if you don't mind... What is it? Turbulence? The inertial dampeners on this thing should smoothe that out. What the hell? The right drive pod is intermittently switching to reverse thrust. Cut it. I can drive with just the left pod. It's not recognizing any of my commands. Brace for impact. What? We're going down. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Saison 2 - Episode 14 Grace under pressure Transcript: Raceman / Callie Sullivan Sous-titres: Team SG-66 - www.seriestele.net Griffin, McKay, come in, please. Jumper 6, come in, please. Griffin, McKay, come in, please. Yeah. We're here. Rodney. Thank god. We thought you... I've been trying to get ahold of you for over an hour. Find Dr. Weir and tell her I've made contact. You okay? Not so good, no. Are you alright? I think we could both use an extended stay in the infirmary. What the hell happened? The Jumper you were flying dropped off our screens. You crashed into the ocean. Yes, yes, yes, we... we're under water. Yes, you are. Then how are you going to find us? We've determined the direction of your radio signal, but not the range. How deep are we? One, two... zero, zero... and falling. Radek, you're going to have to hurry it up. We are already 1,200 feet deep and sinking at a rate of about... 20 feet a minute. Very impressive. Excuse me? Well, we always theorized that the Jumpers could be utilized as submersibles. Yes, yes, yes, I theorized it. But 1,200 feet? That's almost the maximum depth of a nuclear-powered submarine. We are not so keen on setting any records right now, so just... That's a problem. - Can you move? - Yeah. Radek, the windshield's giving way under the pressure of the ocean. Move into the rear compartment. The seal should be able to hold. One step ahead of you. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! The crash probably damaged all sorts of systems. Maybe if you were more focused on flying than enlightening me on the history of tomatoes... All your focus didn't get the drive pod to shut off. I'm still not blaming you. Yeah, because it's not my fault! I've got an idea. What are you doing? Good luck, Rodney. No, what are you doing? Griffin! Griffin! Why did he do that? Why would you do that? Wide open fields. Wide open fields. Wide open fields. You are not stuck in a metal casket under thousands of feet of water. You're in a wide open field. Now... Zelenka? Radek, it's Rodney. Come in, please. Radek? The Jumper's radio transmitter is in the forward section, which is now flooded with water, which means that you have no way to contact the surface, which means that they have no way to triangulate your position. Okay. Alright. You've been in worse situations. Just because you can't think of them right now doesn't make it any less true. But you're not dead yet. You can fix this problem. You just need to... work one step at a time. Now... got to find some light. So... Alright. Light. I have the light. Now what? I thought you said life support could sustain them for days. I said life support would most likely sustain them for days. I had no idea the ship would sink so quickly or that the cockpit would flood. That's when you lost contact. If they didn't make it to the rear compartment in time... They made it. Still, they're going to be much harder to locate now that they're no longer broadcasting. Then find another way. Look, even if we do locate them, our options are limited. They're already deeper than a rescue Jumper's windshield can handle. I'll handle the rescue. You just worry about finding them. I've already got some ideas. Alright, we're on a clock. Let's get back to work. I'm dropping 20 feet a minute. So pressure increases by one atmosphere every 33 feet, so... that's an additional atmosphere every minute and a half, which means... I'm currently under 37 atmospheres worth of pressure and counting. Oh, my. That is a lot. That's... Okay, I've got to slow down. Okay. I've got to stop sinking. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Send a message first. Yeah. Check and see if you can get the radio transmitter up and running, because they can't find you if you can't tell them where you are. Come on, McKay. Prioritize. Here we go. Now... Here we go. There. Right... So... There we are. Okay. Now, how's our radio transmitter? Yes, I know that, so... activate emergency transmitter... protocol. Now... we're broadcasting a signal. All it needs to do is penetrate 1,400 feet of ocean, which means that a whopping three percent of the signal will reach the surface, so... so boost... boost the signal. How much power do we got to work with here? Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Three hours? What's eating my power? I'm working with flashlights here. The inertial dampeners are active? Well, why? I don't need them. Shut down inertial dampeners. Oh, come on! They are draining what little power I have left here. You do not need inertial dampeners while you sink! Now... You are a piece of junk! And I'm going to die. Okay, so... we know the direction which the initial radio signal came from, right? So that places them on this line here. Now, unfortunately, ocean currents could have pulled them in either direction, either this way or that way, so the area they are in is approximately... here. Now, Dr. Bryce here has been studying the ancient database in regards to the ocean, and this particular area is between 2 and 6,000 feet deep. 6,000 feet. We'll never be able to get down that far. Yes, I know, which is why we have to find them before it gets there. They were already at 1,200 feet, and falling, what, 20 feet a minute? Yes, that's right. That at least gives us a place to start. Yes. So... let's begin. I'm freezing. Why am I so cold? Oh, no. I haven't lost that much blood, have I? Of course, it could have something to do with the billion or so gallons of freezing water you're surrounded by, you idiot. Alright. I need to heat this thing, and I don't want it to cost me a lot of power. Can we at least do that, please? Alright. There you go. See? I'm not greedy. I just don't want to freeze to death. Oh, come on! A little heat is going to cost me 40 minutes? Is that really how you want this to go down? You want to freeze me to death? You sure you wouldn't rather I imploded with you, you lemon? Do you even have an opinion, anyway, you... no. Why? Because you are an inanimate object! Does that stop me from talking to you? Oh, no, no, no, no, my inanimate friend, because I have been struck upon the head. You see? There... So... 20 minutes of power for just enough heat to stave off hypothermia. You drive a hard bargain, my friend, but you've got a deal. I just made a deal with you. Deal... Let's make a deal! You've got a deal. That's not funny. What's wrong with me? It's... euphoria, elation... overconfidence, it's... hypoxia. I'm going to dial up the CO2 scrubbers or I'm going to die of hypoxia. That is so funny. Take this corner... take it over here, move it over here. What's all this? Ah, this is my plan. Yeah, I figured that much. - You care to elaborate? - Well, doctors Moore and McNab are here to study the ocean on M8R169, which happens to be under a thick sheet of ice, so they brought a thousand-foot cable and a pretty powerful winch to lower their instruments... Okay. And Ager over here is responsible for the magnetic grapple designed to lower F302s into our Jumper bay. And you intend to put the two together. Like chocolate and peanut butter. Is the mechanism gonna be strong enough to lift a half-flooded Jumper out of the water? Not a chance. - Well, then why... - Because we don't have to. We just have to get near enough to the surface so that we get McKay and Griffin out with a cutting team and rescue divers. Good. How long? Couple of hours. You and Rodney have been bugging me for a chance to try out a Jumper as a submersible, but you sure went a hell of a long way to make me say yes. You still haven't said it yet. I just did. How close is Zelenka to finding them? I'm gonna go ask him. CO2 scrubbers operating at 100%. Well, at least something is. Now... let's see if I can... Why do they have to make these things so small? Look, I need to be the one on the surface saving the poor bastard stuck down here, not actually be the poor bastard stuck down here. By the time Zelenka comes up with a plan, I'll have died of old age. Hello? Are you friendly or are you hungry? Because I am pretty sure that this thing is an instant case of indigestion, so... It's the transmitter. It must be broadcasting at a frequency you can hear. Whoa, there, fella. Whoa, there, fella. I'm... I'm sorry if I'm bugging you, but... but I kind of need to leave this thing on for a bit, you know? Maybe you could tell my friends where I am. You could... could you do that? Could you go get help? Could you... do that? What am I doing? Well, I'm treating an alien whale like Lassie. Look, Okay, if you're not going to help, then just swim on by! Swim. Maybe the Jumper can swim. Okay. The cockpit is inaccessible, but most of the control conduits run back here, so if you were really meant to be submersible, then your drive pods should function underwater, too, which means I could fly you from back here. Well, not fly, but I could surface. I mean, if I get close to the surface, then the emergency transmitter won't have to penetrate so much ocean. Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. How are we doing? Well, we're making progress... slowly. Show me. We started with the likely location of the Jumper based on the numbers we got while triangulating its position during its brief radio contact with us. We then estimate how far off course it is being taken, if at all, by the various currents, slipstreams, and underwater rivers that the Jumper may or may not have run into. We then we add its descent speed at various rates. That's all you've got? You haven't narrowed the search area at all. No, no, in fact, we've increased it slightly. And how does that count as progress? Because we're no longer guessing. We now know definitely that the Jumper is somewhere in this area. Okay. Elizabeth, even if we do find them, there's no way to... Sheppard's working on a grapple system that should be able to raise the Jumper. - Really? - Really. It's going to be ready in a couple of hours. I need you to be. This little keyboard is killing me. It's all starting to blur together. I need a new set of eyes. Let me take a look. Did I just... Yes, you did. Sam? Don't worry, Rodney. We're going to get you out of here. How did you... how are you... It's good to see you, too, McKay. Oh, I've lost it. I have completely lost it. No, you haven't. You are not real. You are not real. You are not real. Of course I'm not real. I'm sorry? I'm three million light years away with problems of my own. Yeah, well, so, what are you doing here? You're hallucinating. Oh, and how am I doing that? Right. Is it that bad? The way I see it, you're scared, you're a little panicked, you're a lot lonely... you knew you could use some help, so your subconscious is manifesting the one person you know is smarter than you. Oh, I don't think so. Oh, don't start with me, McKay. You are very clever. I would even give you brilliant, but there is brilliant and then there's me. Every time we've worked together, you've been wrong and I've been right. Even if that were true, and no one is saying that it is, the fact that you could assert that... Why else would I be here? I don't know. Maybe one last romp before I die. One last romp? Please. We never... - Okay, one first romp, but it's romping that comes to mind, not your brains, blondie, now - you've got to admit, I am a handsome man standing... - You're essentially arguing with yourself. You realize that, right? Your mind is creating me. What? What else am I hallucinating? What do you mean? If you're not real, what is? I mean, How do I tell the difference? How do I know that any of these readings I've been taking are correct? You're not that far gone. No, no, no, no, no, no... I... I am unconscious in the infirmary. Look, I'm fine, and this is just a... a post-traumatic nightmare. So come on, wake up, wake up, wake up. No, no, no. See, you really are in the back of a sinking Jumper. Your readings are correct. You knew you could use some help, and you've got a pretty bad concussion, so... So... here you are. Here I am. I suppose that's comforting... in a... terrifying mental health kind of way. Why don't you show me what you've done so far. Right. Of course. Three miles is a very searchable area. You narrowed it down, Radek. You did a good job. He's too deep. Your grapple's only got a thousand feet of cable. We know the Jumper should be able to dive at least a 1,000, so if he's above 2,000, we should still be able to get him with the grapple. - And if he is deeper? - He probably is. The area we're searching goes to 6,000. When the Wraith attacked the city, you were able to turn the shield into a cloak. Yes. Why can't we do the opposite? Turn the Jumper's cloak into a shield. That's right. That would hold back the water, yes. But it would take significantly more power. We'll shut down everything we don't need. But it would take hours to reconfigure. Take what we need. We'll make the changes down there. No, no, no, no, no. I cannot possibly... No. Radek... I... I can't even swim. There's not a lot of swimming under a thousand feet of ocean. Look, I'm not going to order you to go. I will. All I'm saying is that if Rodney can't turn to you, who can he turn to? Alright. Give me a few minutes and I'll get my gear. Now... given I have a limited amount of time to execute my plan before power levels drop too low... but provided that the... coding is correct, we surface, and at that point, they should be able to pick up our regular radio signal, and then come pick me up. How much power would that kill? I don't know. Most of it. It's a bad idea, then. Why? Well, what if it doesn't work? Well, then... then I'm dead. Exactly. Bad plan. Oh, you're right. I should proceed with one of the other hundreds of possible options available to me. Look, I'm not saying I have a better idea... Well, what do I do? Nothing? - Yes. - Oh, brilliant. Stay warm, stay breathing, stay alive as long as you can. Give your team the biggest window of opportunity possible. A window of opportunity for what? For rescuing you. Even if they could find me, which, given underwater currents and multiple possible entry sites, is next to impossible, how are they going to get me out of here? They'll find a way. No, they won't. You and I both know that the one person who can figure it all out is stuck in the back of a sinking Jumper. Me. Oh, touché. Look, I hear what you're saying, and I'm telling you you're wrong. You have some very smart, very motivated people on the surface, and the only thing any of them are working on right now is rescuing you. Oh, come on. They are planning my memorial service. If your plan fails, and it probably will, you could jeopardize their plan. Are you going to help me or not? I'll help you stay alive as long as possible, but no, I am not helping you with this plan. So my own hallucination is saying no to me? You must realize subconsciously that you need to be talked out of this. I can't even hallucinate right today. Alright. We're above the search coordinates. Okay. It should transition seamlessly. Alright, then. Here goes nothing. I... I wouldn't. You wouldn't what? Sorry, I forgot. I'm not helping. No, no, no. Did you see something? Did I make a mistake? Seriously, if you saw something, just... just tell me. You're messing with me. Sorry? You're trying to slow me down. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Don't play mind games with me. I am a mind game. Okay, if you're not going to help me, just stay on your side of the Jumper. What now? Feels like we hit the bottom. Oh, really? Well, this is good. Well, the chances of us imploding are much slimmer. - But Rodney... - No, no, no! No buts, okay? Can I not at least take a moment to enjoy the one bit of good luck I've had all day? This isn't good. Look, just, just... shut up! I mean, you come in here, you don't help me, you say the one plan I've got is bad, you claim to be a creation of my mind, and yet you are in no way dressed provocatively... Look. Well, it's always been there. No, it hasn't. The impact with the ocean floor must have created a micro-fissure in the hull. We're taking on water. Atlantis... this is Sheppard. Come in. We can barely hear you, John. We're going to lose you altogether when we get deeper, so now's a good time to wish us luck. Good luck, then. We'll contact you as soon as we head back to the surface. Have the divers on Jumper 8 standing by. Will do. Weir out. What do you think, Radek? About what? We're underwater. I always wanted to try this. Yes, yes, yes. Just... make sure we're not under too much water. I've leveled out and holding steady at 990 feet. How's it coming? All I'm getting is sporadic life sign readings. As in... sea monster life signs? We're gonna need those shields up and running. Yes, well, then stop talking, please. Will do. It's funny, because actually... I was just, you know, thinking, what would complete this experience? Would be... freezing cold sea water in the compartment, lots of it, and because now that the whole imploding thing is kind of off the table, drowning should really be brought back into the equation. You can fix this. There are micro-fractures all along the seam. You still have fully functioning life support, right? Yes. Then create a positive pressure environment. What? If you can increase the pressure inside the Jumper, you should be able to slow the leaking. We'll never be able to stop it. I'm not saying that we could. We're just trying to buy time here. In order to make death as long and as drawn-out as possible? Just max it out, McKay. Alright. We should probably find a way to heat this water, too. We make a good team, you and I. Sure. No, no, I mean it. I really enjoy working with you. Always have. I wonder... I wonder why we never... hooked up. Well, aside from the fact that you're petty, arrogant, and treat people badly? Yes. No, that's pretty much it. Petty, arrogant, bad with people. But... you do find me attractive... I mean, physically. Let's stick to working on my idea. This is my idea. How do you figure? Well, you don't exist. You think what my subconscious tells you to think, so really, the idea was mine. I'm arguing with myself about who had an idea first, me or me. I really am petty, aren't I? And arrogant and bad with people, yes. Here we go. And the leaking... has been slowed. Well done, Sam. Thanks. You too. Come here. Okay. You do realize what you're actually doing here, right? Oh, come on! You're a figment of my imagination. The least you could do is take your top off. Your subconscious mind knows that I would never be into that. You are the worst hallucination ever. Oh, you don't mean that. Yes, yes, I do. Now, please, just leave me alone while I work on getting myself out of this. You're not gonna still try and control the Jumper from that little thing, are you? Yes, yes, I am... and I have to do it quickly, before power levels drop below 50%... so... that leaves me about 10 minutes. If you're not going to help, then please stand back and keep quiet. See, this is why I could never have a relationship with you, Rodney. You don't listen to people. You don't trust them. I have every reason not to. Look, this whole thing is Zelenka's fault. He was the one responsible for supervising the Jumper repairs. He was the one who said she was ready to fly. He was the one who came to me embarrassed because he was afraid to fly at the best of times, not to mention a test flight. God, I should have just told him to suck it up, but no, no, I say, "sure, I'll take her out," and now he's all safe and warm and cozy on the surface, while I'm stuck down here, paying for his mistakes. You'll excuse me if my trust in my fellow scientist is at an all-time low. If you want something done right, do it yourself. Okay. I think we may be on to something. Initializing shields. Nice work, doc. Okay, let's take this thing a little deeper. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I was afraid of this. The shield is draining our power at an alarmingly fast rate. Why's that? Well, a cloak draws its power at a constant rate, whereas a shield draws more power the more it is taxed. So... being under several atmospheres of pressure... Yes... is continuously draining power from our shield. How much time do we have? Once we're deeper... 30 minutes, tops. Alright. Descending through 1,000. - Why don't you turn up the heat? - I did. It's the sea water. I've got barely enough power as it is. Besides, I'm almost done here. What are you doing? For warmth. You, you... you're not physically here. You can't transfer any heat. Doesn't mean I can't get you hot. Excuse me? You know, I was thinking about what you said. I think you were right. I am? Right about what? Well, I am your fantasy. It's only fair you should get some. - Really? - Really. I knew it. I knew you were hot. Wait a second. Don't ruin the moment. No, I know what you're trying to do. I should hope so. You're trying to slow me down again. Actually, I'm trying to do the opposite. No... No. You're distracting me. You know I've only got a couple of minutes to execute my plan. You're doing the one thing you know could possibly slow me down. You're thinking too much. Come here. No. No, I'm not going to fall for your plan, lieutenant colonel siren. This program is gonna work, and I am gonna execute it. Don't do it, Rodney. It's not gonna work. Look, you're cold, you're desperate, you've banged your head. You're primed to make a mistake. I should have ignored you from the beginning. You've done nothing but slow me down. They're coming for you. They're gonna get you out of here. - Please, just give them a chance. - Not listening. Don't. And there. It's ready. No time to argue. It's a mistake. I trust you'll be gone by the time I reach the surface. Don't... speak right now. I really don't need an I-told-you-so, so... How much power did you waste? 30 minutes. - Okay. That's not so bad. - No. No, I... I've got... half an hour till we're completely out of power. Half an hour till I'm dead. Bloody hell! It's screwed up this. Whose idea was this, we'll be under water, this time? I think my czech's getting better, because I know what you mean. Could be the shield, could be the depth. I'm having trouble detecting the Jumper. Only... Only what? Could you bring up the H.U.D., please? What's that? Your sea monster. It's at least six to eight times as large as this Jumper, so... let's not venture too closely, okay? How are the shields doing? 12 minutes. Alright. Let's check it out. Why? Because it's still swimming around in circles in the same area, which means... it might have found something interesting. What? What do you want from me? Just... just... go away. I think he... I think he's, he's just waiting to eat me. I treated him pretty bad. The whale? No. Griffin. I changed the subject. You of all people should be able to keep up. Sorry. He knew we were both going to die if he didn't do anything, so... He... Why didn't I think of it first? Maybe I did. I thought of it. I just couldn't... He was a brave man, and I... It just doesn't seem right, you know? It's been a bad day. You're going to get out of this. I don't think I'd even believe that if you were naked. Oh, well. Stick with me Rodney. You've got to stay alert. My plan was stupid. What the hell was I thinking? Well, 20/20 hindsight... You were right. I should have listened to you. I always admired you, Sam... and I'm not just trying to... I know. I honestly don't think you're smarter than I am. On your best day... we're, like... maybe a tie. There is a compliment coming, right? Yes. My intelligence aside... you're wiser. I guess at the end of the day, that's why you're down here. You were right. Well... you were right. At least subconsciously. I guess that's something. Jumper. I have the Jumper. The animal's circling around it. Jumper 6, this is Sheppard. Come in. According to these readings, it's dead. There's no power. Alright, let's get a grapple on this thing and go home. No, it won't work. Why's that? It's taken on too much water. Sensors indicate even the rear compartment is partially full. The cable can't take the strain. - Well, we can try. - No, listen to me. - No. It's a matter of simple physics. - I'm not coming this far without doing something. The shield. We could extend the shield between the two Jumpers. Do we have enough power? Yes. If we touch down on the ocean floor to conserve engine power, it should be just a matter of walking between the two Jumpers. Alright. I'll get us close. What the hell was that? Help. McKay, Griffin... do you copy? Sheppard? Hey, buddy. What say you lower your door? I think that's probably a bad idea. Listen, long story short, we've converted the cloak into a shield and extended it around your Jumper. I'm standing outside right now. What? All you have to do is open your door and walk to my Jumper. I told you they'd come up with something. What? What if it's not Sheppard? What do you mean? What if it's another one of my hallucinations? What... if it's the pessimist in me who just wants it all over with? You heard the shield come on. I hear you. McKay? What's the holdup? We need to do this sooner rather than later. The shield ain't gonna hold forever. You're minutes away from hypothermia. I just... I can't tell what's real and what's not. Rodney... they're here. They did it. Let them help you. Okay. O..okay. Better stand back. I've taken on a lot of water. No. Secondary release. Rodney, are you alright? - I will be. - Where's Griffin? He was in there. - Alright, let's get you home. - No, I need to decompress. Carter told me to increase the pressure. Carter? I did. I did. I told myself. I hit my head. See, pal? Sorry you won't get to eat me today. He's the reason we found you. Really?
