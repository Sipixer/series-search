- Right there. Which one ? Put this one... This is how they need to get around, right ? Go inside the train. Hello ? Madison ? Honey ? Hi. Oh, hey. So... ... how was your day ? Send it to Graeme Peel. Graeme has better things to do than look over my nonsensical scribbles. Well, they didn’t look nonsensical to me. Okay, fine, they did. l’m an English major. What the hell do l know ? Send it. Look, what’ve you got to lose ? - Good night. - Good night. l’Il get it. - Jean Miller ? - Yes. Hi, l’m Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter of the United States Air Force. Okay. Did you send a math proof... ... to Professor Graeme Peel of the California Institute of Technology ? Was l not supposed to ? Sorry to interrupt. You need to pack your toothbrush, head back to Earth. - l do ? Why ? - Carter needs help. - With what ? - Your sister. - Welcome back to Earth. - Yes, yes. What has my sister done ? Good to see you too, McKay. Greetings, salutations, pleasantries. What’s she done ? l thought that-- Well, it’s certainly some very interesting stuff... ... but, no, can’t be her work. l mean, she’s been out of the game for years. The game ? Yeah. She hasn’t published a single theoretical-physics paper in four years. Oh, that game. She was on a fast track to some pretty exciting grants... ... doing some interesting work. l mean, she was no me, of course, but she was at least a you. Anyway, she got herself knocked up by some English major... ... and priorities shifted overnight. Tried to talk some sense into her, but she’s a tad on the stubborn side. When was the last time you spoke to her ? - Four years, maybe. - Four years ? Not that l didn’t check to see if she’s published. You realize what this proof means, right ? - Yes, if the math checks out. - l’ve been over it. It checks out. Well, no offense, blue eyes, but l’d like a little more time with it myself. It checks out. She said it just came to her ? She was playing with her kid and she got a notion. A notion. That is just beautiful. She’s gonna love this. You didn’t tell her l’ve been trying to prove something like this ? - Not exactly. - Oh, good, because she would just-- Wait a minute. Why not ? That’s part of the reason l asked you here. She’s been cleared by the Pentagon... ... but she refuses to sign the confidentiality agreement. She says she wants nothing to do with us. To be honest, she’s been a bit of a pain in the ass. Forget her, then. She’s made her choice. We’Il just have to figure out how to implement it on our own. Let’s see. Now, upon first glance, there are certainly some missing pieces... ... that aren’t exactly spelled out in the proof, but... What ? This would go a lot faster if your sister were onboard. - She’s not gonna listen to me. - You’re her brother. Exactly. - Hi. - Hi. - Long time no see. - To say the least. - Aren’t you going to invite me in ? - Why are you here ? l can’t just stop by and say hi to my little sister ? We haven’t spoken in four years. You’ve never done anything like this. So, no, you can’t. l’ve been kind of busy with work, doing a lot of traveling and such. And l was called back on business. So l was in town... ... and l thought l’d, you know... - Wait a second. - What ? You’re not here because of the physics proof, are you ? - No. That’s part of the reason l’m here-- - You work for the U.S. government ? No, l work for a multinational oversight advisory that-- You know what ? l don’t care. l already told that colonel person... ... l don’t want anything to do with them. - Do you know what you’ve written ? - A math proof. Some theoretical physics. l am willing to wager it has no practical application at all. - l’Il take that action. - What does that mean ? - Just sign the damn agreement. - No. Getting all proprietary about our research and ideas... ... is everything that’s wrong with science today. Did you know that one-fifth of our genes... ... the very building blocks of our being, have been patented... ... by major pharmaceutical corporations ? One-fifth. If there’s any benefit at all to what l’ve written... ... it’s that it’Il spark an idea in someone. l am not gonna sign away my rights, least of all to the U.S. military. It has sparked an idea in someone, a big one. - Like what ? - No. Can’t tell you. - Not till you sign the agreement. - l’m not signing till you tell me. - Is everything okay ? - Look who showed up. Hey. It’s my brother. Right. Hey. Hi. - Hello, little one. - Did you bring me a present ? - Madison. - What ? No. - l didn’t know it was a rule. - It is. Well, l guess l broke that rule. l made some dinner. Would you care to join us ? Well, that’d be great. l’m starving. You have no idea what time zone l came from. Well, l sure hope you like tofu chicken. l sure hope he’s kidding. Here you go. Not a fan of vegetarian cuisine, eh ? Yes, well, l suppose l was just in the mood for, well, food. l’Il give Maddie her bath. You two catch up. - Okay, hon. - Hey, pop your head in before you leave. - What ? Why ? - Children like to say goodbye. Oh, the-- Yeah. Sure. Sure. Boy, Madison’s sure grown, huh ? Since she was born ? Yeah, yeah, she has. Okay, look, l don’t wanna waste any more of your time. You need to come with me. Your proof could lead to something groundbreaking. - How long would l be gone ? - Well, like, a couple months, tops. A couple of months ? Are you joking ? l-- Madison has her first ballet recital next Tuesday. She’s 4. How good could she possibly be ? - That’s not the point. - Hey, she’s not gonna remember. - l’Il remember me not being there. - This is bigger than your responsibilities. Okay, we’ve had this conversation before. You belittle my choices, l get furious at you... ... and we don’t talk for four years. l’m not all that anxious to do that again. This is not what Dad would have wanted. No, he would have wanted us working together side by side... ... toppling problems and sharing credit. Oh, you share credit now, do you ? This is important, Jeanie. It’s much more important than you could ever imagine. For you, l am sure it is. But this, me being here, this is important for me. Why can’t you accept that ? - You know, you leave me no choice. - What ? - Give me your hand. - Why ? Please just give me your hand. Will you just. . ? - Okay, what the hell just happened ? - It’s okay. You’re perfectly safe. l don’t feel perfectly safe. You’ve been teleported to an interstellar vessel in orbit around the planet. Please. Teleportation is about as likely as time travel. Yes, well... - Oh, my. - Oh, yes. Is that. . ? Why aren’t we weightless ? Artificial gravity. And, yes, that is North America... ... and you are in geosynchronous orbit. We work for something called the Stargate program. Stargate ? It’s a device that creates stable artificial wormholes... ... that allows us to travel between other planets, even other galaxies. What have you gotten yourself involved in here, Meredith ? - Meredith ? - It’s a long story. - It’s his name. - Your name is Meredith McKay ? It’s Meredith Rodney McKay, yes, but l prefer to go by Rodney. Could we stick to the point here ? Look out the window. - Much more interesting than my name. - Your name is Meredith ? So this is, like, a spaceship ? This is a U.S. Air Force vessel called the <i>Daedalus.</i> Your equation has real-world applications... ... l’m certain you’ve never even considered. You see, there are some very bad creatures out there... ... that want nothing more but to destroy this planet... ... and everything that you hold dear. Did you say creatures ? - Like alien creatures ? - Yes. Look, the work we could do is important, Jeanie. It’s not just to you or me... ... but to every living being down there. And that includes Madison and... - Kaleb. - Kaleb, yes. - We can’t do this without you. - Let’s not go overboard. - l mean, she’d be an asset, but-- - McKay. So, what do you say, Mrs. Miller ? - Jeanie ? - It’s just a lot to take in right now, okay ? Just give me a second, Mer. So somewhere down there, my husband is giving my daughter a bath. You have to go. l know. - What did you tell Kaleb ? - The truth. What ? Do you have any idea what nondisclosure means ? Just because we don’t keep secrets doesn’t mean we’re incapable of it. Well, what did he say ? He’s concerned that me telling him will get him assassinated. - That-- That won’t happen, right ? - Oh, probably not. I’m sorry I couldn’t come with you, but there’s too much going on here. It’s fine. I thought I could help get Jeanie up to speed... ... before you guys are out of comm range. About a year ago, your brother came across an abandoned alien experiment... ... called Project Arcturus. It was an attempt to generate zero-point energy. That would be virtually limitless power. What happened ? A slight problem. It was the creation of exotic particles in the containment field. He destroyed a solar system. - Meredith. - It was uninhabited. Your brother, with others, has been trying to figure out a way... ... to draw zero-point energy from a parallel space-time. Which would get us around the creation of dangerous exotic particles... ... in our own space-time. And my theory is about bridging universes. Exactly. And we’re hoping to use your proof as a theoretical basis... ... for building a bridge from a parallel space-time to ours. The energy you’d need would be enormous to the point of absurd. « Absurd » we can do. We have a zero-point module... ... which does what we’re attempting on a smaller scale : Extract energy from subspace-time. - So subspace is real ? -You’re flying in it. Aren’t you worried about the exotic particles crossing back over my bridge ? That’s the beauty of your theory. It should not only allow us to build a bridge... ... it should also allow us to manage the flow rate of energy. Like a faucet. - Well, it’s something like that. -It’s exactly like that. What about the parallel universe ? Aren’t you just shifting the exotic-particle problem to their side ? Potentially. But when you consider... ... that the number of possible parallel universes that we could access... ... borders on the infinite... ... the odds of us choosing at random one that’s inhabited... ... are astronomically slim. I know, it’s an awful lot to take in at once. l solved your problem in my spare time. - With finger-paints. - Here we go. l just can’t imagine how you’re surviving the humiliation. If it wasn’t for my work, your theory would be useless. Whoa, whoa, siblings, please. - Sorry. - Sorry. What ? Well, it’s just that you both said « sorry » in that cute little Canadian way, and I-- Sorry. Touch base when you get back to Atlantis. Good luck. These creatures must be quite the threat for you to even try what you’re doing. Now, l don’t wanna scare you, but you need to know the stakes. We’re at war. - Did you start it ? - What ? No. - Come on. - Well... You’ve got a nota bene by the cosmological constant. Why is that ? Jeanie ? Hey. Yeah. Why you’re here, remember ? Thank you. - So there’s your problem, right there. - What are you talking about ? It’s here. - And you made a mistake. - No, l didn’t. Okay, so we need a yea or nay on the equations. Yea. Atlantis already has a containment chamber we can use. I’Il forward the necessary modifications to zelenka. If he doesn’t mess it up, he can make the changes we need... ... before we even get there. Ready ? Now, we’ve been through these calculations... ... and we’ve settled on a containment-field setup... ... that should work for us. l just wanna show you these... Yes, we have it, people. Good work. Good work, everybody. Just in time. - Has he talked about his sister with you ? - Once or twice in passing. Usually like, « Come on, even my sister can do it. » - You know, that type of thing. - How’s it coming, Radek ? The simulations are in the green. We’re ready to try power-up. - Just in time. - That’s actually what l just said. Holy cow. Now, that can’t be good for you. Nothing to worry about. l’ve done it dozens of times. John Sheppard. Yeah. She’s married and she’s my sister. - l’m just saying hi. - Yeah, l know exactly what you’re doing. l’ve seen that look before, Kirk. Hello, Mrs. Miller. l’m Dr. Élizabeth Weir. Welcome to Atlantis. Thank you. Mer’s told me so much about you. All good, l s-- - Did you just call him Mer ? - It’s her pet name. Where are we ? Simulations are in the green. We’re ready to try power-up. Really ? So soon ? That’s amazing. Excellent work, Radek. - Thank you. - Yes, we try not to encourage him. He’s got a bit of an ego. In-chamber conditions are green. Containment field is in the green. - Monitors are green. - Everything’s green. - He likes to do the checklist. - ZPM levels are well into the green. And backup terminals are green. We’re ready to initiate power-up. - Good luck. - All right. Here we go. Want to turn it on together ? - Why would we do that ? - Because it’s both of our work. There’s only room on the button for one finger. - Well, then can l do it ? - Yeah, but l’m right here, so-- He likes to push the button. - Fine, go. - Powering up to 5 percent. Containment field is holding. Power generation is steady. - What about exotic particles ? - Jeanie, please, l’m on it. We are holding at 5 percent. Good. Now what ? The safe thing to do is hold at 5 percent for the next while. Yeah, she wasn’t talking to you. - It was an open question to the floor. - Shared credit, huh ? We’Il do this together. Dad will be so proud. - This is not the time or the place. - Fine. - l’m going to my quarters. - Yes. Well, good night. Thank you. So ? Well, obviously we hold at 5 percent for the next while... ... and see if any problems turn up. Right. l should probably try to get some rest myself. Could you. . ? What the-- ? Shut it down. Foreign object. Go get Dr. Zelenka. It worked. - What are you doing ? - Radek. Yes. l need to speak to whoever’s in charge of this project. But that’s you. Well, then, l guess l need to speak to me. - What is this ? - Hey, Meredith. Oh, wonderful. John here was kind enough to show me around... ... offer me a warm meal, and introduce me to some of your friends. - What have you told them ? - We weren’t talking about you. - Oh, you weren’t ? - No. We were discussing many things. Now, when the issue of bed-wetting happened to come up... ... she may have mentioned something about your childhood. That is not true. - Relax. We all have embarrassing stories. - Of course we do. One time, the school bullies made me eat lunch with my underwear on my head. Oh, wait, that was you. - And this is revenge for what, exactly ? - You don’t even know, do you ? Colonel Sheppard and Dr. mcKay to the Isolation Room immediately. Isolation Room ? Come on. - What in the world ? - That’s you. No, that is a live closed-circuit feed... ... of a man we have in the Isolation Room. What ? He appeared in the containment chamber in some sort of force field. - What do you mean, he appeared ? - Out of thin air. l have Zelenka working on it. Obviously we shut down the project. Well, how did he get in there ? He claims to be from a parallel universe. You said the odds against this were astronomical. - You saw the math. - Well, we got it wrong. He’s here now, so the question is, what does he want ? To talk to you. All right, you want shared credit ? You’re coming in with me. Now, l figured you’d be here, but Jeanie ? l always hoped we’d work together in Atlantis. Well, this is a first. - For me too. - For me too. Have a seat. Now, l presume you go by-- Rodney. Rod. l could never get anyone to call me that. Okay, l’m gonna make some assumptions... ... based on what l’ve seen here... ... and from readings we’ve taken in my own space-time. Please stop me if l’m wrong. One : l presume you’re running some sort of experiment... ... that’s designed to bridge between parallel universes ? And, two, it has something to do with power generation. - Warm ? Cold ? - Hot. Well, l’m sure the experiment’s been a success on this side... ... but it’s having some rather serious repercussions in my universe. - l told you. - Not now. Dangerous particles that don’t belong in either of our universes... ... are being created on your side of the bridge. So you knew this could happen ? It was a slight risk, yes. - This is weird. -Well, you’re quite correct, Jeanie. Because these particles don’t behave according to any laws of physics... ... in our space-time... ... they’re creating a tear in the fabric of our universe. - First a solar system, now a universe. - Yes. How exactly did you get here ? Well, we detected the anomaly about 20 hours ago in space above the planet. We maneuvered one of our Jumpers in close... ... and tried to broadcast a signal to whoever was on the other side. We would be unable to detect that signal from within the containment chamber. So Sheppard and l came up with a plan to beam a person into the anomaly. They would be protected by an Ancient personal force field that we discovered. l depleted ours. Still, it was an incredible risk. Well, it was Sheppard’s idea. We decided it might allow one of us... ... to cross the bridge and bring the problem to your attention. There was very little time and, well, there seemed no other way. - We drew straws. - You lost. No. l won. What, the prospect of saving an entire universe ? No, it was-- No-brainer. Oh, sure. l can’t begin to say how sorry we are. Yes, well, you could start by shutting down the experiment ? Already done. And after hearing what you’ve told me... ... l see no reason why we’d start it up. Great. Then my work here is done. Mission accomplished. Well, yes, but how did you plan on getting, you know, back ? l mean, to your own universe. The matter bridge you created is unidirectional. - But that means-- - Yes. Yes, it does. So, Jeanie, you have three kids in this universe ? No, just the one. Well, l’m sure you’re as great a mother in this space-time as you are in mine. This’Il blow your mind. l have photographs of your alternate life. Wanna see the kids you haven’t had yet ? Absolutely. Oh, look at Maddie. - Who’s that ? - That’s Bradley and Robbie. All right, what’s the game plan ? Put him up in the guest quarters till we can find something permanent. Something more permanent ? We’re not keeping him. - He can’t go back. - That doesn’t mean he has to stay here. - He’d rather be on Atlantis than Earth. - l see. So he gets his way and l don’t. How can you not wanna be with him ? He’s you. He’s not me. l’m me, the real me. l suppose it’s all relative. To Rod, his reality is every bit as valid as ours. To him, we’re the impostors. What does Élizabeth have to say about this ? Two McKays are better than one. There aren’t two McKays. There’s one McKay and him. Whatever you say... ... Meredith. Nice shot. Easily 275. You know, l’ve been meaning to put up buoy markers... ... but who has the time, huh ? This is great. We don’t have one of these where l’m from. Besides, you’d need to take a cattle prod to the Sheppard l know... ... to get him up this early. Late nights partying, huh ? If you could call it that. He’s very active with the Mensa club we have there. They have a lot of functions. Well, can’t blame a man for his intelligence. No, but l can blame him for reminding me all the time. - He doesn’t. - Trust me. My Sheppard makes your Rodney seem modest in comparison. Well, l got to admit, between you and me... ... you’re a lot different than our Rodney too. How so ? It’s the little things. You like golf. You say please and thank you. You’re... What’s the opposite of condescending ? Now, l can help you with that hook. - What the hell is this ? - Hey, sleepyhead. - Yeah, hi. - l had a breakfast date with Jeanie. l guess it ballooned into a group affair. Sit down. We’re tracing back our lives... ... trying to find differences between our pasts. Rod is an honorary member of the Athosian Council. And is godfather to his niece and nephews. - Yes, well, how wonderful for him. - Well, it’s easier for me. Our Earth has a ZPM too, so it makes the back-and-forth a lot simpler. Doctors mcKay, please report to the containment chamber. Doctors mcKay. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Hey, Rod, are we still on to spar later ? - Absolutely. What do you mean you started it up ? Shutting the experiment down only made things worse for us, not better. The matter bridge is still active, but we are not drawing any power... ... creating pressure like a dam. If we didn’t turn it on, it could have resulted in a catastrophic overload. - We should have thought of that. - Don’t look at me. You’re willing to take the credit but none of the blame ? l never wanted all the credit. - Oh, no one is blaming you. - Oh, really ? Look, this is just a temporary solution. The Zelenka in my space-time estimates that there is at least a week and a half... ... before the tear expands as far as the city. - My city. - What’Il happen when it does ? Imagine what would happen if you threw the laws of physics out the window. Entropy. Chaos. Worst-case scenario, the entropy expands as far as the subspace layers... ... underneath our space-time. It could travel instantaneously. Your universe could flash out of existence. We need to mend that tear before it becomes irreparable. l have some thoughts. Is there a place we could go to work ? Oh, yes, of course. Follow me. - Jeanie, we could use your help. - Thank you. Do you mind running up these power requirements ? Done. What were you doing having breakfast with him ? l don’t often meet people from another universe. l found myself curiously interested. Well, l don’t want you hanging around with him anymore. - What ? - Look, l am your real brother. - In what sense ? - Oh, what is that supposed to mean ? You haven’t been a brother to me since l quit school. You were making an incredible mistake. l was trying-- You were trying to control my life, Mer. l disagreed with you. l still do. What, because of that, you stopped being my brother ? - l never stopped being your brother. - We haven’t talked in four years. - Don’t put that all on me. - It is all on you. l had no way of getting in touch. l was doing top-secret research in another galaxy. You could have sent me a message. You know, call me on my birthday, at Christmas. Once a year, that’s all l would have needed. Just a,« ou » ?Hi. How are you ? Are you happy ? Are you okay ? » That would have been enough, but you didn’t do that. l was wrong and you were right. So, what, l was not worth talking to ? It wasn’t like that at all. You don’t like me talking to Rod... ... because it makes you realize how bad a brother you’ve really been. Hey, you guys got something over there ? No. We don’t. - He’s slowing me down. - Really ? l thought two of you would have sped things up. Yeah, he’s not me. l know he’s not the same person, trust me. Just saying he’s a genius too, isn’t he ? - Unless he’s lying. - About what ? What if the people on his Atlantis were sick of him messing up all the time, huh ? So when it came time to send some stooge to another universe... ... there was only one guy they could do without. Say what you want. l know what this is about. Oh, really ? Mr. Mensa-ln-a-Parallel-Universe, what is this all about ? You think Jeanie likes him more than you. What ? That’s crazy. That’s-- That’s-- That’s possibly true. Jeanie and l drifted apart. l mean, that happens. It wasn’t done maliciously. Do l have regrets ? Yes, of course l do. But who doesn’t ? l mean-- You know, l’m not very good at saying l’m sorry or that l’m wrong... ... you know, possibly because it happens so rarely. So l didn’t call or write. And when l realized that four years has gone by, it was just a... You’re right. Of course, you’re right. She has every reason to hate me. - l didn’t say she hates you. - Yeah, well, she should. - Well, if you insist. - Yeah, l do. Fine. Fair enough. Dr. mcKay to the containment chamber. Dr. mcKay. Good talk. Thanks. - Great, he’s here. - What’s going on ? l set up a way to pick up transmissions inside the containment chamber... ... should Rod’s universe try to contact us. We, of course, still have no way of communicating with them, but-- - They sent us a message. - Yeah. Their exotic-particle problem... ... is spinning out of control much faster than they’d anticipated. - Oh, boy. - But they have a solution. - They do ? That’s great. - Well, not really. Their solution will not only destroy Atlantis... ... but tear a hole in the fabric of this universe. Oh, boy. Now, l’m not saying that their attempt would be successful, but if it was... ... it would flood the exotic particles created on their side... ... into this space-time all at once. - And that would-- - Be bad. - Right. l got that, but-- - How bad ? Well, to be honest, the science gets extremely complicated... ... but simply put... ... the tear will eventually swallow up the entire galaxy, possibly the universe. So... ... very bad. l think we can all agree that that would be bad. Their plan will take six hours to implement. l suggest we do something before that. - Well, we have an idea. - Actually, Jeanie has an idea. We think we can collapse the bridge with a massive burst of energy from this side. And stop the creation of exotic particles on the other side by doing so. - How massive a burst are we talking ? - Everything we’ve got. l mean, enough to severely deplete our ZPM. So instead of creating a new powerful energy source... ... we’Il be sacrificing the one we already have. Yes. We’d still be able to dial Earth, but much less frequently, of course. And let’s just say, l wouldn’t wanna be around here if the Wraith show up. l don’t see that we have a choice. All right. Do it. Dr. Weir gave the okay for this ? You’d rather the universe was destroyed ? - Not really. - Rodney, can l talk to you for a second ? Look, the <i>Daedalus</i> is still in orbit. l thought-- l know what you’re gonna say. If l can beam into the energy stream, protected by my personal force field-- You’d be transported back to your own universe. l know. l didn’t bring it up because, if it doesn’t work-- Well, l’m willing to take that risk. l’ve already requested the <i>Daedalus</i> to execute the transport... ... to the coordinates inside the chamber on your mark. That is, if you’re willing to do this. Everyone loves you here. Yeah, but it’s not home. Look, what, my Sheppard is a know-it-all... ... my Teyla is hard to talk to, and my Ronon is-- Well, actually, those two are pretty similar. l guess what l’m trying to say is that, for all their faults... ... they’re my team. My place is with them. Besides, they’re not looking for another McKay around here. - They already have one. - It’s just a lesser model. l envy you. You say exactly what’s on your mind no matter how it makes you look. l can only imagine the freedom you must have not caring if people like you or not. - What, people don’t like me ? - Trust me, you’ve got it great here. Now, l’ve made some calculations. When the readings reach the levels l’ve indicated... ... you’Il know whether or not l made it home. Well, l guess you just need to click your heels together, huh ? Good luck, Rodney. Yeah, you too. Radek. Jeanie. - You’re letting him do this ? - l tried to talk him out of it. But you know Rod. Hermiod, ready when you are. l guess there’s nothing left to say but there’s no place like home. All right, all in the green. Ready for forced power output. Right. Then... You wanna press the button ? Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Power is at full. It’s working. Hermiod, this is McKay. Commence transport. Transport is complete. - The bridge is beginning to destabilize. - It’s not yet enough. - ZPM’s at 50 percent. - It’s still not enough, Rodney. - We have to max it out. - Thirty percent. The bridge is collapsing. We’ve done it. - Okay, we can shut it down now. - Not yet. According to these readings, if we shut it down now, he won’t make it. Give it a few more seconds. - ZPM’s at 5 percent. - Almost there. Cut power now. How much power did you drain from the ZPM ? All of it. l drained all of it. You did the right thing. Well, l suppose l would’ve done the same thing for... ... me. l am so fired. Jeanie, it’s your brother, Rodney. I wanna say... ... family is important. I’ve come to realize that because the people here... ... have become a sort of a kind of surrogate family to me. I know what you’re thinking. I’ve never been the poster child for that kind of sentiment. But when one’s contemplating one’s own demise... ... one tends to see things more clearly. I really do wish you the best, you know ? And I’m sorry we weren’t closer. Perhaps... ... if, by chance, I make it out of this, perhaps one day we can be. And I would like that. Now, if there’s time, I’d like to-- When did he record this ? Couple years back when we thought the bad guys were gonna get us. Now l’ve seen three sides of my brother. Yeah. What are you two up to ? Nothing. Just telling stories about you. You know, trying to help her fall asleep. l’Il leave you guys alone. - Hey. - Hey. Hey, you should be packing. Daedalus leaves in the morning. l’m done. How’d it go with Weir ? Well, she wasn’t too happy about the whole killing the ZPM... ... but, you know, in the grand scheme of things... ... we did prevent the destruction of the universe. So, you know, not fired. - That’s good. - Yeah. Oh, right. Got this for Madison. Yeah. Swiped it from Weir’s desk. Well, it’s not like there’s a Toys R Us nearby, so... Well, it’s the thought that counts, l guess. - Well, l’d say,« ou » ?See you around, » but... - Yes. About that. Which is to say... Look, what l wanted to... Thank you for trying. How are you ? You happy ? You okay ? Yeah, Mer. l am. l really am. Intergalactic Gate Network should be completed soon. So... ... maybe it won’t be four years next time ? Does this mean l’Il see you at Christmas ? If you can convince Kaleb not to make Tofurkey. No promises. Am l just not getting the team e-mails anymore ? Take it easy. We’re just talking about Rod. - Oh, yes, well, of course you are. - Do you think he made it back ? Well, it’s hard to say, really, but l doubt he’Il be back, though. - Good. We found him a little creepy. - What ? l can’t stand people who are nice all the time. Makes me feel like they’re trying to hide something. - Really ? - He kept trying to correct me... ... on my Athosian history. It grew tiresome very quickly. Why, well, he wasn’t that bad. Yeah, well, let’s be honest. Rod was annoying. Well, l’Il be honest with you. That’s kind of nice to hear. Now... ... what else has been happening ? Well, Teyla’s got the hots for one of the new Marines. - That is not true. - You know it is. Hardly new either.
