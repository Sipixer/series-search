completely immune to the Wraith. We want to test the serum's effectiveness against your prisoner. We're talking about putting a human in the same room as a starving Wraith. The test subject is a terminally ill patient who has volunteered himself. What have you done to me? We've been tracking what appears to be a new sickness in the Pegasus galaxy. It's a unique protein created by the inhabitants of a planet called Hoff. It was designed to interfere with the Wraith's feeding mechanism, making them immune to the process. It also killed the feeding Wraith, and half the people who took it. Let's not forget that Michael spread the modified Hoffan drug to dozens of worlds, possibly more. No one knows for sure, right? Which means that every time you feed, you're taking a risk. Once more. Bad news, I'm afraid. You'll have to go back to school tomorrow. Maintain the amoxicillin for 3 days. That should do the trick. Now, what do we have over here? All these dressings need to be changed. Can you go to the storeroom and get more bandages, please? - Yes. - Thank you. You're looking good, my friend. - Mail call. - Colonel! - What are you all doing here? - We heard you needed supplies, so we thought we'd come by and see how you were doing. A "Hop, skip, and a jump from the Gate"? That's what you call that? Nice to see you too, Rodney. - How are you, Doctor? - Well, thanks. I take it these are the antibiotics I ordered? Dr. Keller gave you a whole whack, so they should last for a while. God, I wish that were true. What does that mean? I've been dealing with infections from the Hoffan plague survivors. I can barely keep on top of it. Survivors of the Hoffan plague here? This is not one of the planets that Michael targeted. No, but many of these people come from another planet, Balar. They managed to survive the plague, and just when they're starting to get their pieces back together, the Wraith showed up, tried to wipe them out. We heard rumors about that. They aren't pleased to have populations that are immune to their feeding. Just a handful of the Balarans survived. The locals were kind enough to take them in. - Doctor? - Novo! These are my friends from Atlantis. Colonel Sheppard, Teyla, Ronon, and Dr. Rodney McKay. This is Novo. She's been helping me here in the clinic. Pleasure. You as well. I've heard a lot about you. Is he the one? The one what? From all the funny stories. Right! Yeah, well, I hope you all can stay here for dinner? I mean, the canteen's not fancy, but they do serve up one heck of a stew, made from a goat-like creature. - Delicious! - Goat-like? Great idea. Gives us a chance to catch up and relive all those... "funny stories." How's life in the wilds of Pegasus? You got to be missing Atlantis by now. - Surprisingly, no. - Come on. The hot baths, playstation, deodorant? I know it seems a wee bit rough, but it's not, really. Wherever I go, people are kind to me. I never want for a meal or a place to sleep. And to be honest with you, I'm really starting to feel like I'm making a difference. What is it? Wraith. Season 5 Episode 12 Outsiders (v. 1.00) The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams I count nine of 'em. - We can take 'em. - No. There's too many civilians. It does not appear to be an ordinary culling. - How do you figure that? - For one thing, there are no darts, and they do not seem to be attacking the villagers. Who among you speaks for the rest? I'm Elson... leader of this village. What do you want with us? You've recently taken in a group of refugees from another planet. They are survivors of a plague. It's important that you turn them over to me immediately. Why? The reasons why do not concern you. Provided you cooperate, you have my word we will leave peacefully. And if we don't? That would be a very unwise decision. Our hive will be here before the night is through. If you have not complied by then, I will give the word, and your entire village will be destroyed. Turn over these outsiders, and your lives will be spared. Resist, and you will all die together. The choice is yours. I don't understand. They've already destroyed our homeworld. Why would they hunt the rest of us down as well? You didn't tell them? Not the whole story. What are you talking about? Novo, remember when I told you that, as a plague survivor, you'd be immune to the Wraith feeding? Well, there's a bit more to it than that. Any Wraith who tries to feed on you, or anyone like you, will, as a result, die instantly. You're poison to them. - Then we're as good as dead. - Not necessarily. They won't tolerate our presence anywhere. Not if what you say is true. They found you on this world, it does not mean that there is nowhere you can hide. - Did you hear? - Yes. This is Sefaris. He's also from Balar. The councilors are meeting to discuss whether to heed the Wraith's request. - What? Where? - The mine office. I tried to get in, but they turned me away. Ronon and Teyla, scope out the Gate. You two stay here. Watch these people. Can you show me where this mine office is? Yes. Colonel, what are you gonna say to them? I'm gonna give them another way out. You're telling us that, as a result of this plague, the Balarans are now deadly to the Wraith? Pretty much. So the Wraith would never risk culling this village? That's true, but that's also why they're willing to wipe you guys out completely. A village that can't be culled is no good to them. Did they know? What? Did the Balarans know they were bringing this curse upon us when they came here? - No. They had no idea. - It's not their fault, Jervis. Maybe not, but that doesn't matter. The Wraith won't rest until every last plague survivor in this galaxy is dead. Except the Wraith have no idea who they are unless people like you point them out. I'm not happy about this either, Colonel, but what other choice do we have? Well... we may be able to move all your people to a different planet, where they'll be safe. - You mean leave our homes? - Look, I know it's not ideal, but the only other choice is to turn in a bunch of innocent people, and I know you guys aren't gonna do that, right? Well, as the Wraith said, they're outsiders. Jervis, we agreed to let them come here. I didn't agree. Besides, they weren't a threat at the time. Now that's changed. But they've become like family. Novo lives under my roof. She eats at my table. My daughter adores her. - What am I supposed to tell her? - You'd prefer that we all be killed? - <i>Colonel Sheppard, come in.</i> - Excuse me. Go ahead. Ronon and I are at the Gate. It does not appear to be heavily guarded. It's the same guys from the village. I recognize the commander. What are the odds of you two getting by 'em? Pretty good. Slim, actually, but much better if you and Rodney join us. Yeah, all right. Hold your position till we can get there. What is it? - How many people are in this village? - 600, 700. Well, we'll be tight for time, but we can manage. - What are you suggesting? - We take the Wraith out, get everybody through the Gate before the hive ship comes. You should be safe in Atlantis till we can relocate you. Unacceptable. The Balarans don't deserve this. They did nothing but survive a sickness. It could just as easily have happened to us. If we turn these people over, we are no better than the Wraith ourselves. Look, even if you cooperate with the Wraith, there's no guarantee they're gonna keep their word. They may just kill all of you for being an inconvenience. All right. What do you want us to do? Be ready to move. Take only what you can carry. Let's go, Rodney. We're gonna hit the Wraith. - We are? - I'll come with you. Not a chance, Doc. I don't have time to argue. Get these people ready for transport. Once the Gate's secure, we're gonna have to move fast. Okay, but be careful. If we're gonna attack, we gotta do it from over there. Agreed. As soon as we take the Gate, we should call in some Jumpers. It'll make evacuating the village a lot faster. Not to mention we can use the extra firepower in case the hive gets here before we're done. Oh, let's hope it doesn't come to that. - <i>Colonel Sheppard, come in.</i> - Go ahead. We have a problem. More of the Wraith have begun arriving back. They must have been out on patrol. How many? Can we still get out? No. For the time being, we're stuck here. You said you could get us out. Well, there are more Wraith than we thought. The Gate's too heavily guarded. - So we're trapped? - For the moment. I haven't given up hope. I just need time to develop a new strategy. What strategy do you propose we use to defeat an army of Wraith? Well, I don't know. I haven't thought of it yet. Look, worst-case scenario... My team and I don't show up, the people back on Atlantis will dial the Gate and contact us by radio. I can order back-up. Will that happen before the hive ship arrives? - Probably not. - We can't wait that long. For all we know, the Wraith could be lying about the ship. And why would they do that? I'm just saying, we need to stall as long as possible. This is madness. Elson, we have to think of the safety of our people. Oh, I'm thinking about the safety of your people. - All your people! - We can't rely on their help. We have to make our own decisions. I need time to think about this. The time for that has passed, Elson. We have to act. And if you're not prepared to do so, then I will. Jervis! What's he gonna do? I don't know. - Where's Novo and the others? - We sent them home. Why? Can these people walk? Well, if need be, but I thought we couldn't get them through the Gate. No, we can't for the time being, but I don't think they're safe here either. Grab your weapons. Come with me. Get out of my way. She's not here, Jervis. Where is she? What are we gonna do, Novo? We have to get out of the village. What the hell's going on out there? Some of the villagers decided to take matters into their own hands. - Let's go stop 'em. - First things first. We got to move these people. Grab some gear. We don't want any trouble. Just hand over the Balarans. I don't think so. Don't make things difficult, Colonel. You had your chance to save the village. Now it's my turn. Saving the village? That's what you call this? This isn't your affair. It's up to us to decide how to deal with the situation. Yes, it is, but Jervis, this is not our way. Our way? Our way is what got us into this situation in the first place! We've already given them more than they could have ever asked for. All right, why not just shoot them right now and get it over with? It's a death sentence anyway. Shoot them yourself, and spare them the torment of being tortured by the Wraith. - You'd be doing them a favor. - Carson. Go on! Kill them all, then, if you're that desperate to be done with them! - You're making a big mistake. - Maybe, but at least we do so with a clear conscience. - Doesn't matter anyway. - What are you talking about? My men are already on the way to the Gate with the first group we captured. It's too late. What are they gonna do to us? Be calm, Sefaris. You're scaring the others. Maybe they should be scared. - We both know there's no escape. - We cannot give up hope. Face it, Novo... we've been betrayed. They don't want us here. They never did. We were doomed the moment we had to leave our homes. And, to think... as a survivor, I used to consider myself one of the lucky ones. - Is Jervis taken care of? - He and his men are locked up. They will not be giving us any more trouble, though I do not think it was necessary to stun them. Felt good, though. So what now? I gotta get the rest of the Balarans out of the village. There's no telling if anybody else might feel the way Jervis does. - Where should we take them? - The forest? It's kind of a long haul at night. Wait a minute. What about the mine? These tracks lead right down to it. I mean, we just follow them. - No one gets lost. - Exactly. All right. Go get Beckett and his patients. Bring them here. We'll round up everyone else. - What is it? - Something's happening. What's going on? You'll be moving shortly. Where? Your new home. The hive ship has just arrived. Wait. - I have a proposition for you. - What are you doing, Sefaris? Something we should have done a long time ago. There is nothing you have to offer me. Don't be so sure. There's someone hiding in the village. He's of far greater value than all of us put together. - Sefaris, no... - Spare our lives, I'll take you to him. A fair attempt... But the answer's no. My life, then. How could you do this? I promise, it'll be worth your while. I believe that is everybody. Where's McKay and Beckett? Rodney, what's your status? Still at the clinic. Carson decided to pick up a few more supplies. Tell him to get a move on. We can't stay here forever.</i> Go ahead, Colonel. We'll catch up. - <i>You sure?</i> - Absolutely. We'll be right behind you. Let's get going. Stay together. Follow the tracks. There. That should do it. Rodney, can you give me a hand here? Remind me to bring a sherpa next time I visit. Him. He's the one. You see? I kept up my end of the bargain. So you did. Unfortunately, in light of your... "condition"... keeping you alive is far too risky. Darts. - Rodney and Carson are still not here. - Rodney, come in. McKay? You guys keep moving. I'm gonna go get him. - <i>Ronon? Teyla?</i> - Go ahead. The Wraith just got Beckett and McKay. - What? How? - Took 'em up in a dart. I think they're on their way to a hive. How did the Wraith know that they were in the village? I think I got an idea. Rodney. Rodney, wake up. Oh... God, is it me, or have they juiced up the stun weapons? Oh, and they brought us to the hive. That's great. What are we gonna do? Just don't... Don't panic. Don't panic. I have... got lots of experience escaping from these things. - You do? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been in this situation dozens of times, always figured a way out. - How, exactly? - Let's see. Last time, Teyla was posing as a queen, so... You know, she had us released. - Not much chance of that happening. - No, I guess not. - How about the time before that? - Ronon's friend Tyre was pretending to be in league with the Wraith, but really he was on our side, so... - he let us out. - I'm starting to sense a pattern here. You've actually never really escaped from one of these cells on your own? - First time for everything, right? - God, Rodney. Well, just... give me a minute. I'll think of something. I hate to pressure you, Rodney, but I don't think we have a minute. Bring them. What is this place? A lab belonging to my top scientist. For the last six months he has been studying the deadly toxin that has infiltrated our food supply. Where is he now? Dead. He was convinced he had arrived at a foolproof way to detect the poison. To prove it, he decided to feed on one of his test subjects. Guess that didn't work out so well? He died in excruciating pain. Needless to say, his research has been stalled ever since. And that's where you come in, Doctor. Me? - What do you expect me to do? - The one who identified you said you had considerable expertise in dealing with the toxin. He even said you had a hand in developing it. If anyone can find a way to detect it, you can. If you think I'm gonna help you, you're sorely mistaken. I anticipated you might say that, which is why I'm prepared to offer you an incentive. Thus far, I have spared the lives of the people on the planet below. If you cooperate, I will continue to do so. But if either of you try to cross me in any way... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we get the picture. I knew you'd come to see it my way. Get to work. Give me one reason not to blow your head off. What for? How did the Wraith know to grab Beckett? What do you mean? Doctor's been captured? I swear, I had nothing to do with that. - What about your men? - No. No, there's no way. The Doctor has been nothing but good to us. They didn't just stumble across the clinic. Somebody brought them there. Well, why don't you ask the Balarans? They're the ones with the most to gain. One of them probably thought he could save himself by turning in the Doctor. I told you they were no good, Colonel. Damn it. None of these consoles are hooked into anything. I can't access any of the ship's systems. What about you? You making any progress? Carson? You okay? I can't do this, Rodney. - What? You don't understand it? - No. I mean, I can't do it. Do you realize what'll happen if the Wraith can detect the Hoffan drug? They'll hunt down every last person in this galaxy that has it. That's hundreds of thousands of people, Rodney. Not to mention the fact that, when they're finished, they can start feeding again, indiscriminately. What's the alternative, huh? We know the Wraith aren't gonna let the matter drop. We've seen what they can do. They'll wipe out entire villages just to get a few like the Balarans. - So what am I supposed to do? - You just stall. You know, you make it look like you're working, and... Till we figure out how to get out of here. Then? Go about our business? Pretend this never happened? I never said it was gonna be easy. But you can't solve all the galaxy's problems in one day. Look, I understand. You feel guilty. But this is not your fault. You had no idea that any of this was gonna happen. One of the first things they taught us in medical school was "Do no harm." I'm at a loss right now to figure out how that's possible in this situation. How are they doing? They are frightened. I've been trying to reassure them, but it is of little use. - How's it going in here? - We are getting by. - What is happening in the village? - Not much. Everybody's hiding indoors. Why hasn't the hive ship attacked yet? Do you think it could have something to do with Rodney and Carson's capture? I don't know, but we should use this time to come up with a plan. - You got anything? - Maybe, but it's gonna take some work. What is it? You got something? No. You sure? You got one of those "Beckett" faces. Aye, I'm sure, Rodney. Just go back to work. - Where you going? - Talk to the commander. - What? Why? - There's something I need to tell him. Oh, I knew it. You found something. What is it? - Open up! - Seriously, tell me. You know I'm gonna go through your stuff. Just leave me be, Rodney. Open the door! Will you just tell me what's going on? I need to talk to the commander right away. Listen to me, Rodney. I need you to stay here. Don't worry. Everything will be just fine. Right. Doctor. I didn't expect to hear from you so soon. - This must be good news. - For some people, maybe. I'm here to tell you that I'm off the case. What are you talking about? I'm not gonna do your dirty work for you. - Find someone else. - There is no one else! Then that's too bad for you, isn't it? You're trying my patience, Doctor. You forget, I control the fate of the people below. People will die no matter what I do, so I'm not gonna do anything. If you refuse to complete the research, then there is only one other way that you could be of use to me. And, trust me, you won't like it. You don't scare me anymore. Do you understand? I don't give a damn what you do to me. Suit yourself. I'm going to enjoy this... Very much. What is this? What have you done to me? Turns out you were closer to detecting the Hoffan drug than you thought. It didn't take me long to perfect your blood test. And once I confirmed it using samples that you provided, I decided to do one more test, just to be certain... On me. You have the toxin? Indeed. And now... so do you. Hello, Rodney. Can you delete this data? - Of course, but how did you... - I talked the commander to feed on me. - What? What? Why would you do that? - I have the Hoffan drug, Rodney. Michael must have given it to me as a defense. - Why didn't you tell me? - You would have stopped me. It's stupid! What if you were wrong? I had to do something. It's the only chance we had to get away. Will you help me destroy this research before they find out what I've done? - Right. - Okay, great. The coast is clear. - What are we doing, exactly? - What do you think? We're looking for a way off this ship. By wandering aimlessly through the hallways? I'm not wandering aimlessly. I'm exploring. There's a big difference. Bingo! - What are you doing, Rodney? - Hacking the ship's communications. - Are you sure that's a good idea? - Look, if we don't get Sheppard, we don't stand any chance of getting off this ship. - You're gonna have to cover me. - All right. From which direction? What was that? - <i>Sheppard, do you read me?</i> - McKay, is that you? Thank God! We are on the hive ship. I've got Beckett with me. - What the hell is going on up there? - <i>We managed to escape.</i> - Beckett helped. - <i>That's great,</i> - 'cause we could really use the help. - <i>You?</i> Look, we're the ones stuck on the ship! That's exactly where you need to be, because we need someone - to take out the hive's main weapons. - What? We got a plan, but it's only gonna work if we take the hive out of the picture. It is bad enough I hacked into communications! If I start messing around, they'll track us down! Rodney, it's the only way to get these people to safety. Once that's done, we'll figure out a way to get you guys out of there. All right. I'll see what I can do. Give me a few minutes. Should be enough. You're a good man, Rodney. - Just don't forget about us, okay? - We won't. Good luck. - Think he'll be able to pull it off? - Well, he'd better. Otherwise this thing's gonna go very badly. Jervis. - What do you want? - We need to talk. I have nothing to say to you. You were right all along. I should have listened to you. The Atlantians have no idea what they're doing. They claim to have a plan, but, in reality, they're just putting all our lives at risk. Well... It's a little late now, isn't it? Is it? If you went to the Wraith at the Gate right now, do you think you could get them to honor the original deal? It's possible. But... I'd have to deliver all of the remaining outsiders at once. They're in the mine, hiding in the main chamber. Are the other councilors on board with this? The less they know about it, the better. And you? Can you reconcile this with your conscience? Leave that to me. You just make that deal. What is it? Search the ship. - How long is this gonna take? - Do I rush you while you're on surgery? Aye, it's been known to happen. All right, I'm in. Now, I just need a few minutes to disable the... Geez! - I think they found us! - You figure? Okay, you're gonna have to hold them off. - Am I, now? - Come on. You can do this, all right? All right. On three? - How about on one? - All right. Right. And, one! How's it coming? Almost there. I can't hold them off forever, Rodney! We have to go! Now! All right, that's it! I got it! Let's go! - Where we going? - Dart bay. - You know how to fly a dart? - I've flown Jumpers before. I've been to Tokyo. Doesn't mean I can speak Japanese. Well, how hard can it be? - Do you even know where you're going? - I pulled up a schematic of the ship. What? While we were being fired upon? That's sealed. - How long do you think it'll hold them? - Not very. Well, come on. - What are you doing? - I'm getting in. We can't both fit in here. You're damn right I can. Now shove over! You comfy? Peachy. What are you waiting for? - It should just start up. - It didn't. I know, but it doesn't make sense. A canopy should form over our head. - Might be some kind of a weight limit. - What's that supposed to mean? I mean because there's two of us! - Maybe you need a key, or something? - It's not a Volkswagen, Carson! Okay, look, these are obviously the flight controls. That makes that propulsion, so... - Where'd you come up with that? - It's just common sense! - Come on! - Right, common sense. What do you want from me? It's not like there's labels! - Oh, not good! - You're telling me. - We need a new plan. - I know! I'm thinking! Whatever you do, think fast, because if they come through that door, we're both dead. - Rodney, we need to go. - Where? I mean, we're trapped in here! Then we need to find a place to hide. Come on. - What? - I have another idea. It's a long shot, but it might work. But you're gonna have to get off me! Once you've taken these people, you're gonna leave the village, right? For good? This place is of no concern to us. All we want is the Balarans. There's a large chamber up ahead. That's where they're hiding. Where are they? I don't understand. He said they were here! They should be right here! What is this? Think we killed enough to make a difference? Guess we'll find out. Nice work. We've received word of an explosion that's killed several of our warriors. The humans continue to attack our troops. They're trying to escape. Target the area around the portal and open fire. Weapons aren't responding! What? Dial the Gate. This is the first group. There are more are coming. We've got to move fast. They won't take this lying down. Go. All right. Come on, let's go. Stay level, stay low. We've lost contact with the troops at the Gate. What about the two human prisoners? They're nowhere to be seen. They couldn't have just disappeared. It doesn't matter. We can't let the villagers escape. Launch the darts. Go, go, go, move! Crap! We've got more coming! Go, go, go! You're almost there. - My God, it worked! - Rodney, you're a genius! - What'd you do? - I reprogrammed the culling beam. Once the Wraith lost their main weapons, they were gonna launch the darts. Let's go! There you are! I've been calling you. I'm sorry. What's up? Lorne found a suitable planet for the villagers. - They're gonna move them out. - Aye, I heard. I'm going with them. Right. Of course. Well, you want to... grab some lunch? We didn't get any chance to socialize, unless you count, you know, running through the halls of the hive - as social time. - Aye, you're right. Look, Rodney, I'd love to, but I really need to get through this. What is it? Dr. Keller's research on the serum that keeps my cells from deteriorating. I think there might be something in here to help the plague survivors, since I'm not getting the infections that they are. You don't have to do this now. I'll download the data to a drive. You can just, you know, take it with you. Actually, you can't. Mr. Woolsey doesn't want it leaving the base. - I'm sorry, Rodney. - Well, I don't care. I was just trying to stop you from whining about never seeing me. All right. Rodney, wait. Now that I think of it, I am a wee bit peckish. Besides, I can't solve all the galaxy's problems in one day, can I? - Well, I... - Shut it. Right, let's go. So? Interested in anyone these days? Me?
