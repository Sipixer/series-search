you refer to as Ancients. There’s a lot of Wraith, we could use help fighting them. We will eliminate the Wraith at a time of our choosing. - They don’t seem very Ancient-y to me. - Ancient-y ? WEIR : Hopefully, this is just a stumbled beginning of a-- McKAY : They’re not people. DEX : McKay ! They’re machines. Replicators. McKAY : So l’m in Atlantis and l need to get to Earth. What do l do ? Since we no longer have access to a ZPM... ... due to unforeseeable circumstances... ... my only option would be to call the <i>Daedalus</i>... ... and spend the next three weeks waiting to get back home. Until now. l give you the McKay<i>/</i>Carter Intergalactic Gate Bridge. Thirty-four gates from the Milky Way and Pegasus gate systems... ... have been strategically placed in the void between our two galaxies. Simply enter on either side-- For example, Atlantis. - -and boom. A macro that l have written specially for the occasion... ... will command each gate in the chain to store you in its buffer... ... and forward you along to the next and the next until you arrive here. Once at the Midway Space Station, you exit the Pegasus gate system... ... and enter the Milky Way gate system where a similar macro... ... designed by yours truly, will forward you along to the SGC. Total travel time, a little over 30 minutes. Cue applause. Thank you. Enough. Midway Space Station isn’t completed yet, so... ... we’Il test the system today using a Puddle Jumper. - Now, given the his-- CALDWELL : Show and tell’s over. The test is about to begin. Let’s get back to our stations. Right. All systems seem to be... Hm. What ? Oh, there’s an odd echo in the proximity sensors. Won’t affect the test, but... Yeah, we’re ready to go. SHEPPARD : <i>Gate is dialed.</i> Forwarding macro’s been uploaded. All right, John. You have a go. All right, then. Here goes. McKAY : We have a contact. Colonel Sheppard, right on time. What’s your status ? It felt a little weird, but everything seems to be in one piece. Ready to proceed to next phase. Uploading macro... ... and initiating dialing sequence. No, no, no. This is weird. - Shall l tell him to stand down ? - No. It’s nothing to do with the test. It’s just our sensors aren’t working properly. Daedalus ready to proceed. Do l clear him ? Yeah, yeah. l’m sure he’s fine. He’s good to go. Good to go. Yes, go ahead. Colonel Sheppard, you have a go. Jumper is away. He’s late. When traveling three million light-years, l’m not sure there’s such a thing as late. Right. Yes. You’re just mad you didn’t get to fly the maiden voyage yourself. General, l am quite fond of both maidens and voyages. - Put the two together and you-- - You’re not a test pilot anymore, Jack. That’s what the president said. HARRIMAN : Incoming wormhole. It’s about time. SHEPPARD : Sorry, sir. Colonel Sheppard, welcome to Earth. - Thank you, sir. Good to be back. LANDRY : <i>You know where to park.</i> We’Il debrief, go over the flight data when you’re ready. Yes, sir. Colonel, we’re receiving a data burst. Jumper 3 has arrived at Stargate Command. - Mission accomplished. - It worked. - l’m already on to the next problem. - Which is ? Well, the sensors are having a hard time determining what it is... - ... probably due to the Doppler effect. - What is ? l’m detecting a foreign object traveling at. 999 the speed of light. And it’s coming this way. MAN : We have a contact, sir. - Col. Sheppard’s back from Earth. - Welcome back. SHEPPARD : Thank you, colonel. l’ve got a takeout pizza for everyone back in Atlantis. With your permission, I’d like to upload and dial out before it’s cold. Negative. We’re putting that leg of the trip on hold for now. Seems like we’re expecting company. Believe it or not, moving that fast while an incredible feat of technology... ... isn’t very useful. Certainly in comparison to travel through hyperspace. Now, moving as fast as it is, this ship-- Assuming it is a ship. - -would take at least a million years to reach the Milky Way. That close to the speed of light, you take relativity into account. Exactly. The people onboard-- Assuming that they are people. - -would only experience maybe 12 years. A few stasis chambers, they’re laughing. Not laughing, they’re unconscious, but, metaphorically-- So assuming it’s a ship, and assuming they’re people-- - What do we do ? - We try and make contact. Obviously. CALDWELL : How do we do that ? Pull up, honk the horn, get them to roll down their window. l’m talking about matching their speed. This ship isn’t designed to do it. We can’t. Even if we succeeded we’d be subject to the same time dilation effects. We’d be out of contact with Earth and Atlantis for years. Can’t we overtake them with our hyperdrive ? Yes, but they would blow past as we dropped back into normal space... ... because our sublight engines are incapable of accelerating... - ... to anywhere near the speed of light. - So we max out the sublight engines. Get as close as we can get. Yes, that might work. We should at least be able to stay in range long enough... ... to get sensor readings. Yeah. Do it. l’Il let Atlantis know you’re gonna be late. Did you really get pizza for everyone ? Because it would be a shame for that to go waste if we’re going to-- Yeah, okay. So solve this first, and then-- Sir, we’ve got everything we’re gonna get out of the sublight engines. They’re going to fly by us in three, two, one. Interesting. - What ? - If these readings are correct... - ... and to be fair, they may not be-- - Rodney. It’s an Ancient warship. It’s possibly Aurora-class. Who’s flying it ? l would imagine Ancients. There hasn’t been any of them around for over 10,000 years. Relativity. Look. Remember, for them, only a handful of years have passed. - Don’t those ships have hyperdrives ? - Maybe it was damaged in battle. It happens with us all the time. Maybe it conked out on the way... ... and they had to continue close to light speed. They got light-years away from Pegasus without leaving years ago. You know their subspace drive specs better... ... but an Aurora-class ship has the power to do what you’re suggesting ? - Well, maybe they have a ZPM. - That would be worth finding out. We need to send them a message before they get out of range. Like :« ou » ?We are humans from Earth, currently occupying Atlantis. » Why don’t we just ask them to slow down ? Colonel Caldwell, the unidentified vessel is slowing down. Maybe they heard me. No, they saw us. And they’re not just slowing down. They slammed on the brakes at 27 g’s. So now what ? Unknown vessel, l am Captain Helia of the Lantian warship <i>Tria.</i> Our ship has suffered damage. We scanned your vessel and determined that it is capable of hyperspace travel. We’ve begun deceleration maneuvers. Will you render assistance in a form of hyperspace transport ? Well, yes. Yes, of course, we will. - l don’t think she can hear you. - Open a channel. This is Colonel Steven Caldwell of the Earth ship <i>Daedalus.</i> It would be an honor to assist you in any way we possibly can. We’re going to meet Ancients. Flesh and blood Ancients... ... who know everything. l don’t know what to ask first. It’s gonna be hours before we match velocities for transport. That should give you time to write that list. Right. Right. They were battle-scarred and already on their way to Earth... ... when their hyperdrive gave out. They decided it’s best to continue forward than go back. - And how many survivors ? - Just over a hundred. Word has spread amongst my people. They believe this return was foretold. It marks the turning in the tide in the war against the Wraith. l don’t know about that. Dr. Weir ? The <i>Daedalus</i> is ready to beam down our people... - ... and the Ancient delegation. - Thank you. Dr. Weir, Ronon, Teyla, this is Helia, captain of the Ancient ship <i>Tria.</i> - It’s an honor to meet you. - Thank you. From what l’m told, you’ve done a remarkable job preserving our city. We did what we could with what we had. l need to speak to the leader of your people. l’m in charge of the Atlantis expedition. You misunderstand me, Dr. Weir. l need to talk to the one who can speak for all the people of Earth. That can certainly be arranged. But may l ask why ? What is that ? How come l’ve never seen that ? - Excuse me. What’s going on ? - Thank you for all you’ve done, Dr. Weir. But your guardianship of this city is no longer necessary. The city is now under my control. HELIA : We were in a battle with Wraith cruisers. They proved too much for us. So we started back to Atlantis... ... only to be told the final evacuation was already in progress. l decided to push on to Earth and join the evacuees. And even when our hyperdrive failed, we decided to continue on. l can’t begin to imagine what you... ... and your crew must be going through right now. We owe you and your people a debt of gratitude... ... but we’ve just returned home. Home to a place we thought we’d never set eyes on again. And we need some time. Alone. You do know that we’ve shed our own fair share of blood... ... defending the city from the Wraith. By your own admission... ... you are responsible for waking the Wraith. - Right. - And by your own admission... ... you are responsible for the emergence of the Wraith as a species. The fact is, if it weren’t for our expedition... ... there would be no Atlantis. No one’s saying the city doesn’t belong to you... ... or that you don’t belong here. - What we’re saying is that-- - What we’re asking-- What we’re asking... ... is that we be allowed to stay here. WOOLSEY : There is so much that we can learn from you. And in return, we can offer supplies, manpower... ... the kind of support you’Il need to restore Atlantis to its former glory. The day will come when your people will once again have a place here. But that is not this day. You should be in there. l don’t know what l could say to make any difference. SHEPPARD : You’re right. They want us out of here. But why ? There are maybe a hundred or so of them. They could use us. They might need us. What if you were forced from your home by war... ... only to return to find someone on your couch... ... eating your Cheetos, watching your TV ? - l’d be fine with that. - No, you wouldn’t. - How go the talks, sir ? - No talks. Listening is what we did. It was essentially a transitional meeting. They needed to know how much time we needed to vacate the city. l said 48 hours, unless you need more. No. That should be enough. That’s it ? We’re going to take this lying down ? We rescued them. - And they’re grateful. - They’re not showing it. From their point of view, Dr. McKay, they’re being generous. Keep in mind, when they left Atlantis, we were a hunter-gatherer species. If we hadn’t hunted and gathered them between galaxies they’d still be stuck. - We should’ve left them there. - l know you feel you’re losing the city. This isn’t about losing a city, Richard. This is about losing an opportunity... ... to talk with and learn from living, breathing Ancients. They are willing, over time... ... to let us back in the city. Just not right now. That way, we get all of the benefit of Atlantis... ... with very little of the risks or expense. It’s not like we don’t have our galaxy to worry about. Colonel, l’d like you to supervise the withdrawal. - Yes, sir. - Go ahead. Can l talk to you for a moment ? l didn’t want to say this in front of McKay. l know he’d want the job. What job ? The Ancients are willing to leave someone behind as a liaison, kind of a... - ... ambassador, if you will. - l would be more than happy-- It’s not going to be you. Tell me someone who’s more qualified for that job. l can’t. But the l. O.A. wants Woolsey. - Woolsey ? - Yeah. To paraphrase the Ancients, they think you won’t be able... ... to let go. So they’re going to just shut us out, after everything we’ve done here ? l know. Look. You’ve done a hell of a job here... ... and l am sorry it’s ending this way. l suppose l can take comfort in the fact that... ... out of all the ways this expedition could have ended... ... this is definitely not the worst. Thank you. Hey, you guys all packed up ? - l really don’t have that much stuff. - Right. Most of my belongings are already with my people. SHEPPARD : How’s that going, by the way ? Are the Ancients allowing the Athosians to stay on the mainland ? They have found a suitable planet for us to relocate to. - One with our own stargate. - How’d that go down ? It was not the homecoming of the Ancestors my people envisioned. You guys want any of this stuff ? Johnny Cash poster, skateboard, sudoku books ? You know you guys are welcome to come back with us, right ? My place is with my people. l can’t leave this galaxy until every last Wraith is dead. Well, l just had to say it out loud. You should know that we’d be honored if you decided to stay with us, John. Yeah, well, l think the Air Force has got other plans for me. We also just had to say it out loud. Right. Well... This sucks. Yeah. l’m not good at goodbyes. Our paths will cross again, John Sheppard. Of that, l am sure. Well, before our paths uncross... ... could you give me a hand with these ? - l’Il throw in pizza and some beer and-- - Popcorn ? And popcorn for the-- Oh, my God. [ALL LAUGHING ] l was offered a position at Masaryk University... ... before l came here. l imagine l could work there if l wanted to. What about you, Carson ? They offered me a surgery position at Stargate Command. - You ? - l don’t know. Area 51, l guess. Tool around with the database we’re able to bring with us. In a way, l look forward to focusing on a single problem for a while. Being pulled off of research to put out fires can be, you know, frustrating. l suppose. l don’t know how many times l’m gonna be asked... ... to save the day at the eleventh hour at Area 51. - Oh, l’m sure it’Il come up. - Not as often as l’d like. Well, l must admit... ... it’s been a pleasure working with you both. In fact, of all the people-- You are not tearing up on me, are you ? - Oh, he is. He’s tearing up. - l know. Now you’ve ruined it. - Oh, l’m sorry. - l was just about to say something. It’s not like we won’t see each other at the gate. No. Of course not. - l don’t know what l was thinking. - What was it ? - What ? - What you were gonna say. Just say it. Now l’m curious. l was going to say : « Goodbye, Rodney. » [DOORBELL BEEPING ] - Colonel. - Doctor. - Come in. - We are way ahead of schedule. Ready to head out at 0800. Daedalus will take most of the gear. People will make their way through the stargate... - ... thanks to the Ancients’new ZPM. - Good. l guess. - You’re taking this rather well. - Actually... ... l’m pissed. For one thing, l’m only a quarter of the way through <i>War and Peace.</i> l can’t imagine what l can possibly do for a living now. Every government is going to offer you a job. Yeah, but not like this. Yeah, you’re right. It’s all downhill from here. You’ve peaked. « Life isn’t fair. It’s just fairer than death. » - Oscar Wilde ? - <i>Princess Bride.</i> Good movie. Mm. You gonna be ready to head out at 0800 ? Yeah, yeah, l should be. You ? Just one or two hundred things to do. l’Il see you at the gate. Grounding station on the south pier got shot up. Wasn’t our fault. - You’Il need to look at that. - We’Il find our way. - No, l’m sure you will, you should also-- WEIR : Rodney. Right. Yes, well, l gotta go. You have been good friends to all the people of this galaxy. Farewell. Take care. McKAY : Bye. Hi. WALLACE : Ow ! Keep your damn weight off your foot, you’Il be fine. Tell me you didn’t engage the Ori, colonel. We didn’t engage the Ori, sir. Babbis was inspecting some curious fauna... ... when he discovered the ground wasn’t stable. He fell 20 feet into a babbling brook. Wallace was trying to help him when he lost his footing... - ... and broke his ankle. LANDRY : l see. Never thought l’d miss Rodney McKay being a member of my team. Well, chemistry doesn’t happen overnight. We’Il debrief as soon as Wallace is out of the infirmary. - Yes, sir. -Off-world activation. [ALARM SOUNDS] Hold on. You may get a kick out of this. This should be General O’Neill and his scheduled check-in from Atlantis. - He went back, sir ? - Woolsey needed a little backup. Apparently, the Ancients find him a bit trying. Imagine that. -General. - General. -Is that Sheppard there with you ? - Yes, sir. Talks proceed at an acceptable pace but the real news... ... is that the Pegasus Replicators are heading back to Atlantis... -... to make another run at the city. - They are ? No one here seems to be that worried. - Why not ? -They’re Ancients. Apparently, these Replicators have a law in their base code... ... that makes it impossible to harm their creators. And they’re expecting to find us. According to Helia, they’Il run into some kind of nasty surprise. Pass it on to Dr. mcKay that if you and he hadn’t rescued the Ancients... -... and returned Atlantis to their care-- - Might have lost the city anyway. Right. Well, we should get back to our talks. And talks and talks. O’Neill out. Sir, l’d be happy to talk to you more about these Replicator guys. Sounds like they’ve got everything under control. Yes, sir-- Guess they do. McKAY [ON SPEAKERS] : <i>I hate it here.</i> - How is that possible ? It’s true. They gave you all you wanted, your own lab. - It’s too big. - Well, hand-picked assistants. Yeah, sycophants, every one of them. Even your choice of projects. Well, that’s not true. Well, other than going back to Atlantis. [SIGHS] You know, the truth is, l-- - What ? - Okay, l don’t-- l don’t want to use the term lonely, but there are certain people who l miss. Me ? You, l’m talking to on the phone and having dinner with tomorrow... ... so not so much... ... but other people, who l may never see again. Even Élizabeth. She hasn’t returned my calls. l know what you mean. At least you get to go off-world with a team of your own. Oh, yeah, the best and brightest. All right. See you tomorrow night. Yeah, wouldn’t miss it. Hey, you know, I-- [BEEP] Yeah. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Carson. - Hello, Élizabeth. Well, this is a surprise. You didn’t return my messages so l thought l’d just stop by. - Yeah, sorry about that. Come in. - Thank you. Oh, excuse the mess. l wasn’t really expecting company. Oh, please. l’m from a family of seven. Our home was never this clean. - You look good. - Well, thanks for lying. How is the SGC treating you ? It’s only been six weeks, so l’m still settling in, but it’s good. - Interesting work. Kind people. - Good. That’s good. - How about you ? - Oh, you know, keeping busy. - Oh, yeah, doing what ? - l’ve been doing a bit of writing. - Working on my memoirs. - Your memoirs ? - About your time in Atlantis ? - Yeah, somewhat. And on what planet did you expect to publish it ? l suppose it’s for posterity as much as anything else. And for me. Just trying to get it straight in my own head. - It all went by so fast, you know ? - Aye, that it did. Élizabeth... ... we’re all a bit worried about you. You’re worried about me ? Why ? Well, you don’t return phone calls. The few times you’ve run into people, they say you’ve seemed distant. l’m just-- - l’m just trying to move on. - By writing your memoirs ? Élizabeth, why haven’t you taken another position ? The SGC has asked me to consult with l. O.A. and Homeworld Security... - ... and with Ancients. - You don’t need to be here for that. You could take another position and consult them from a secure line. l guess l’m just not ready yet. Look, Rodney’s flying in tomorrow. John and l are taking him for dinner. You should come. Tomorrow. Oh, gosh. Tomorrow, l-- l’Il pick you up at 7. WOOLSEY : That seems like a pretty big ship. You’re sure only sending one Jumper up to fend it off is the right thing to do ? It is impossible for them to harm us. l could use some enemies like that. ANCIENT [ON RADIO] : <i>We’ve established</i> communications, commander. This is Commander Helia. The city you’re approaching is once again under Lantian control. Stand down and return to your planet immediately or you will be-- [BEEP] You said they couldn’t harm you. Raise the shield. [RUMBLING ] - You should call her. - Who, Cadman ? - You guys did make a cute couple. - It didn’t work out. It may have something to do with our first kiss being through Rodney. We made a solemn vow never to speak of that again. l remember no such thing. You know what ? It’s getting late. - Since when do you sleep ? - Since l got back. l’ve had a lot of catching up to do. It’s been lovely seeing all of you again. Thank you for getting me out. We should thank you. You’re taking us to dinner. Cheeky. [ALL PHONES RINGING ] Sheppard. McKay. Hello ? l didn’t bring my bloody cell phone. What’s happening ? We got this data burst about 20 minutes ago. O’NEILL : <i>Atlantis is under attack</i> from Replicators. Somehow, they’ve figured out how to overwrite their programming. The Ancients were taken off guard and have lost most of the city already. [GUNFIRE] -Request immediate evacuation. -They’re coming. They never made it to the gate. l was informed they had a law written into their base code... ... that made it impossible for them to harm the Ancients. How the hell did this happen ? It is remotely possible that in trying to rewrite Niam’s base code l-- We may have opened the door for them to make other changes. You did this ? At the time, we thought it was the only possible way to save the city. It doesn’t matter. They may have changed it on their own. The question is, how do we fix it ? That’s why l called you in. l have my orders. The <i>Daedalus</i> is already on the way. Now, what l need from you is-- What’s the best way to get a nuke past the shield ? - Well, l have no idea. - l didn’t call you in, doctor. You’re going to use nuclear weapons on Atlantis ? - It’s the gateway to Earth. - And we have an iris. Yes, we do, but thanks to your Intergalactic Gate Bridge... ... all they have to do is rewrite your macro... ... and they can come out anywhere in the Milky Way. - But those macros are very complicated. - They are very complicated, Dr. McKay. They just rewrote their own damn base code. l think they can handle it. General O’Neill and Woolsey may still be alive. l know the city very well. Give me 60 Marines and some of Colonel Carter’s new-- - Anti-Replicator weapons. - Yeah, those things. l’m sorry, colonel. l have standing orders. They happen to be General O’Neill’s standing orders. The <i>Daedalus</i> will be there in a little under four days. Now, how do l get a nuke past their shield ? Now, those Replicator thingamajiggies you’re talking about-- Let’s just call them A.R. G’s. McKAY : They’re energy weapons, disrupting links between nanites. Replicators fall apart when fired upon. You know, hypothetically... ... Teyla and Ronon would be more than willing to help. If we asked. WEIR : We would need to gate into Atlantis. All they need to keep us out is to activate the gate shield. l did write a back door to the shield program... ... when Kolya stormed the city. So l mean, it could, hypothetically, let us get into the gate room. Landry was worried about Replicators rewriting the bridge macro... ... to gate them somewhere in the Milky Way. Does that mean you could change the macro ? Take us somewhere else in Pegasus ? Somewhere like, just talking here, the Athosian settlement... ... where Teyla and Ronon are ? - We’d need a Jumper. - And some of those A.R. G’s. And someone to make sure Landry doesn’t close the iris. - Hypothetically. - Of course. The Jumper is in its storage area, under guard. We need to be added to the authorized personnel list. Only one guy who can do that. - You ? - No. Why do you think l’d say me ? - Seemed like you were leading up to it. - No, sadly. Dr. Lee’s been heading the Jumper research project. They refuse to send it to Area 51 for me. l should be able to add one of our key cards to the list... ... but l have to do that from his office. - So ? - Well, he’s in his office... - ... so you need to distract him. - Me ? How ? Well, here’s what l’m thinking... l got to say, l have never met a woman this into World of Warcraft. - It’s a silent passion of mine. - As it is with all of us. l’m level-75 mage... ... specializing in engineering and jewelling. - You ? - Oh, wow, level 75 ? Me, l’m only 50. Well, l had the beta of the expansion pack... ... so l sort of had a leg-up on most people. What’s your race ? Mage. You know l’m trying to increase my enchanter skills... ... but, l don’t know. It’s not going very well. - Oh, l disagree, Bill. - What ? - Rodney. - l don’t mean-- l’m sorry. - l don’t mean to be so forward. - No, no, go, be forward. Well, oh, l-- Look. l’m not quite sure how exactly l should put this... A true mage speaks his mind. Or her mind, in your case. Wow, will you look at the time ? Where does it go ? - What ? - We’re late. We should-- - We’Il see you, Bill. - Bye, Bill. SHEPPARD : Wallace. What are you doing here ? General Landry wanted to talk to me about reassignment. Oh, right. Sorry about that. Are you already going on missions without me or-- ? You should really stay off of that ankle, son. WALLACE : Yeah, well, when General Landry says now, he means now. SHEPPARD : Sorry about this too. Can’t afford to have him telling Landry he ran into us. SHEPPARD : Let’s move. - You set ? - Go for it. [ALARM SOUNDS] What the hell ? General Landry to the control room immediately. They’re going to get through my hack quickly. It’s all right. l don’t need much time. - What’s going on ? - Gate started dialing on its own. - It doesn’t do that. - l know that, sir. LANDRY : Close the iris. - l can’t, sir. Find a way, Walter. Colonel Sheppard, stand down. That is a direct order. Do you want to find out where they’re going ? Don’t bother. l already know. My turtles. WEIR : What ? - l just bought some wee baby turtles... ... and no one knows to feed them. Well, turtles are pretty hardy. l’m sure they’Il be fine. And they make good soup. l figured l’m back for good, so l might as well get a pet. l’m allergic to cats. l’m at work too long to be fair to a dog, so l went with turtles. l’ve probably killed them. - Anytime now, McKay. - Trust me, l am going as fast as l can. Poor little buggers. Milky Way gate just activated. - Did you do that ? McKAY : No. Colonel Sheppard, I’m going to assume that you’re still at the midway Station... ... waiting for Dr. mcKay to rewrite his macro. I understand what you’re doing, colonel. Hell, I’Il even call it brave. But if you don’t turn that ship around immediately... ... and come back to the SGC, I’Il see to it that your career in the military is-- [BEEP] That way, l won’t know what he was going to say. Okay. Okay, l’ve got it. All right. Last chance to change our minds. All right. Let’s do it. LADON : l knew you would never come to me, so l thought l would come to you. Our relationship has been... ... strained... ... but we need to put all that behind us now. We do ? Your friends have returned home and you’ve been asked to leave Atlantis. So the question is : What will you do next ? We are helping my people rebuild this settlement. Yes, but the settlement seems finished. Besides, is carpentry and clearing brush really the best use of your skills ? Get to the point. Come work with me. l understand your reluctance. In the past, the Genii have hardly been a beacon of hope in the galaxy. -« ou » ?In the past« ou » ?? - We are growing stronger every day. We have a number of operations planned that could cripple the Wraith. What do you have in mind ? l am, of course, reluctant to go into specific details here. But suffice it to say the plans are dangerous... ... and in need of your unique abilities. We’re not interested. Well, that’s too bad. Although not entirely surprising. Give it some time, Ronon. l wonder how much joy you’Il find as a Tava bean farmer. - l’m not going to work for the Genii. - We would not be working for them. - Merely with them. - Forget it. Since Atlantis was returned to the Ancestors... ... the Genii are the most powerful and organized group of humans... ... fighting the Wraith. The Ancestors will do something. True but they neither need nor have they requested our help. The Genii have. l know that you are anxious to return to the fight... ... but my people are farmers. - Maybe this isn’t the place for me, then. SHEPPARD : That smells great. - Hope you saved some for us. - John ? - It is wonderful to see you. All of you. WEIR : And you. We missed that. Whatever that is. Something’s wrong. McKAY : They emit a directional energy beam... ... that disrupts connection between nanites. Not what l asked. - Yes, they work good. DEX : Good. So you need us because we know our way around the city ? l need you because you’re part of our team. There may be hundreds of Replicators on Atlantis by now. We’ve got a plan. A good one. l wouldn’t ask you to come with if l didn’t think we could do it. O’Neill and Woolsey were on Atlantis when the Replicators attacked. There’s a chance they’re still alive. l’Il be damned if l let a bunch of Replicators take our home away from us. So you with us ? Okay, l think l’ve loaded up the GDO. It’Il lower the shield when we dial. - Go for it. - All right. Dialing Atlantis. And... What’s happening ? Activate the shield. - l can’t. - That’s confirmation. - Gate shield has been lowered. - Hope this little plan of ours works. Yeah, you and me both.
