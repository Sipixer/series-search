I'm assisting with a medical follow-up on M33-985, yes. - With Keller. - Right again. - On your day off. - I can't go off-world in my free time? No, no, go ahead. I just think it's odd that you're volunteering for goodwill missions on your day off. I'm turning over a new leaf. It's a whole new gentler Rodney McKay. There you are. You all set? You coming too, are you? Yeah, Ronon offered to help out, too, so I just thought, you know, the more the merrier, right? Is there a problem? No, no, just, I was... No, it's nothing. Go ahead and dial, Chuck. I got this. I'm good, I got it. I'm good. You want it? You take that, I got... my own stuff I'll bring. So, the people we're seeing today, as long as you avoid any physical contact, you should be fine. The contagion doesn't seem to be airborne. What's wrong with them? It's a disease similar to one on Earth called influenza. It's been spreading throughout the village. Not too severe a strain, but enough to put a scare into them. He's caught it, too. - Will he be all right? - His fever's mild, so, plenty of rest, lots of fluids, and he should be fine. I'm also going to prescribe some medicine... A neuraminidase inhibitor? Very good. Can I have a look at you too, Erran, just to be on the safe side? Do you guys mind giving us some privacy? I think there's a tavern close by. Why don't you go get some lunch? You want to... Sure. What's the matter, you don't like it? You don't have to be here. I'm sure you got plenty of stuff to do back on Atlantis. Oddly enough, I don't, actually. But if you need to get back, then... No, I'm good. Of course you are. We've given them enough time? I don't want to interrupt in the middle of medical... stuff. Hi. Is Dr. Keller done? She's not with you? She finished with us, then left. Said she was going to join you at the tavern. Right. Very good. Thanks. Jennifer, it's Rodney, do you read me? Dr. Keller, please respond. Either her radio isn't working, or she's turned it off. - She wouldn't do that. - Then what happened to her? Season 5 Episode 09 Tracker (v. 1.00) The Projet-SG & SG-66 Teams - Anything? - Checked the street. No one's seen her. It's like she just vanished. She wouldn't take off without letting us know where she's going. Not unless someone took her against her will. - Go back to the Gate, radio Atlantis. - Maybe you're right. I'll stay here and check the entire village. Who are you? If you'd stop struggling, I wouldn't have to stun you. - What do you want from me? - And stop asking questions. I just want to know why you kidnapped me. How did you take me from the village? I don't even remember... Good. Let's go. - <i>Yeah, go ahead.</i> - I got footprints outside the village. - Jennifer's? - Standard Atlantis tread. But there's someone with her. Bigger prints. Like my size. Looks like there was a struggle. Dammit. Weird thing is... It's like they just appeared out of nowhere. What do you mean, nowhere? I mean there's nothing at all between here and the village.</i> Then they just appear, like they dropped out of the sky. Wait a sec. Got a single set of tracks heading into the woods. What, a single set? Not Keller's, the other guy's. So what happened to Keller's? These prints are deeper. My guess is he's carrying her. Probably knocked her unconscious, or... God. - I'm going to check it out. - Maybe you should wait. All right? I'm almost at the Gate. I'll radio ahead, get a team here, do a proper search. That sounds good. You do that. Meantime, I'm going after her.</i> Yeah, I'm here. I got two sets of tracks again. She's still alive. Great! That's great! All right, I'm at the Gate. I'll get the search teams mobilized and join you shortly. Crap! What? - We got Wraith! - How many? Four of them just came through the Gate. One of them's about to kill me! Finally. What took you so long? You're welcome. - It's a hunter. - What? Wraith hunter. They chase Runners. I thought Runners were extremely rare. - Right. - Few years ago, we run into you, now another? - I mean, what are the odds of that? - Where'd the other Wraith go? I don't know, they spread out into the forest. Where're you going? Where are you going? Wait! This is as far as we go on the trail. Where are you taking me? At least tell me your name. There'll be time to talk when we get there. Where? What are you doing? Watch out! We need to get your people to a safe place as fast as possible. - Why? What happened? - We spotted Wraith in the area. Wraith? Coming here? It's just a few of them. Maybe looking for someone else. We don't want to take the risk. Have you seen anyone different in the village recently? Any newcomers, anyone that looks, like that? No. We don't have time for this. Is there a place your people can hide? There are caverns near the village. Our ancestors used them. Good. Come on, let's go. What is that thing? - Take too long to explain. - Too long? We've been walking for hours now. - Can I at least rest for a bit? - No. Just a few minutes? A few minutes to allow your team to gain ground on us? What team? You're from Atlantis. You're a doctor. There were two men traveling with you. Watch your step. Just keep going. It's just past that gully, you're almost there. That's it, that's it. Mind your step, sir. - Sir? - Ma... Ma'am. Sorry. I... You have a... That is clearly a mustache. That's the last of them. The village is empty now. Go with them, make sure they stay in the caverns. And keep 'em quiet, make sure no one makes a sound unless you hear from me. Or me. All right. Thank you. - Maybe we should go back to the Gate? - No, go ahead. I'll track Keller. It's not wise for us to split up. We don't know where the Wraith are... It takes too long to go back. That Runner took her. We let him get too far ahead, we'll never find them. Look, you want to go to the Gate, go ahead. I'm leaving. Dammit! Would you just... Ronon! You done trying to escape? More Wraith close by. We need to keep moving. You're not from the village, are you? I've never noticed you, and I pretty much met everyone. Are you even from this planet? You're the one who brought the Wraith here. They're after you. Why? I'm a Runner. You know about Runners? One of the men I'm traveling with, he used to be one. Used to be? That's impossible. Runners don't stop being Runners. - Yeah? Well, this one did. - Yeah? Well, how? Take me to him, and we'll tell you. I promise. Look, we don't have to be enemies. Nice try. If you... What? This is where Keller's tracks start up again. Look... Smaller, shallower, Atlantis tread. These prints are bigger and deeper. - The Runner. - Keller's tracks are uneven. She's either hurt or bound. Probably both. At least the tracks are clear. Easier to follow, right? That's the problem. No Runner is that stupid. It's gonna be dark soon. Actually, we have two hours, 43 minutes, and 17 seconds. This planet's sun currently has a very gradual angle of descent and a very short night. I always make it a point to download the planetary data on every address I dial, even goodwill missions. Yeah, things like atmospheric conditions, soil consistencies, available water supplies... What? Just wondering how long you'd make it out here without your little gadgets. I think you'd be surprised. I mean, I may not be exactly what you'd call an outdoors person, but that doesn't mean I don't find man vs. nature thing uninteresting. Hell, I joined a scouting organization when I was a child. Lodge 14 of the Fort McMurray eager beavers. - Beavers? - Yep. Large rodent. Big teeth. They use 'em to chop down trees and build dams... Very industrious. I was with them for a few months before they asked me to leave, but I got the manual... Still have it... <i>Scouting for beavers.</i> Valuable resource. So, I think you'll find, in a pinch, I handle myself very well, thank you very... What is it? Blood. - Oh, my God. - No, it's Wraith blood. Here we go. Someone was sitting here. Look. Single set of tracks... But they left the trail going that way. Are you sure? 'Cause the footprints keep going this way. Single set. Yeah, I know, but maybe he's carrying her again. Or maybe they were attacked by the Wraith, Jennifer was stunned, and then the Runner kills the Wraith and disposes of the body, and then carries Jennifer on up the trail. Look how deep these tracks are. I say we follow these. Easy. Like I said, no Runner is that stupid. What now? We go up. Up? How? Do you have a rope? No need for ropes. Did we just... How did we do that? I was on a planet a while back. Lots of technology. Got this from one of the locals. Barely put it on my arm before it fused to my skin. Since then, if I hit this light when it's green, I can disappear, move around from place to place. Teleportation. That's how you got me out of the village so fast. I can only go short distances. It needs time to recharge between jumps, especially when I take someone with me. But it's helped me stay ahead of the Wraith. I imagine so. McKay! Dammit. What the hell were you doing? At the moment? Killing Wraith! What are you stopping for? - I had a stone in my boot, I told you. - No, you didn't. I did! I said "Wait up, I got a stone in my boot." Every second you lag behind makes it much harder for me to track this guy. - Especially at night. - Not anymore. We don't have to play mantracker now. We'll know exactly where this guy is... Thanks to this handy gadget. Look at that signal. They're farther away than I thought. I'm sorry. I guaranty you, at some point, you'll need my help. You'll see. There'll be some problem you can't solve, then you'll turn to me, I'll figure it out in the nick of time. You'll say, "Good job", or just grunt or slap me on the back harder than necessary, anyways, the point is... We both have our gifts. So you need to stop resenting my presence here, and start realizing we're on the same team, both trying to achieve the same goal. All right? You listening? We got the tracker. Can you hear what I'm saying here? When are you gonna tell me what you want from me? I need you to help someone. - Who? - That's not important to you. You just need to give her medical attention. Her? Who is she, your wife? When we get there, I won't be able to stay with you. The longer I'm in one place, the greater the danger. Probably a dozen more Wraith on the way. Trail ends here. Well, he's dead ahead. So either he climbed this thing, or he figured out how to get around it. - No sign they went around. - They must've had a rope or something. Unlike us. Look, how are we gonna get up there? You said, about solving a problem? Yeah, technological problems, not rock-climbing problems. Thought so. Have you ever thought about trying to remove that tracking device? You could say that. Had a few doctors try. No luck. I have advanced medical technology with me. I know. So I could probably remove it. That Runner I was telling you about? One of our doctors removed his tracking device. So he was able to stop being a Runner. You have something in here that can remove it? I have a scanner. With that, I can pinpoint the location of your tracking device, give you some anesthetic, make a quick incision, you're free. Look, you say there's someone who needs medical attention? It's gonna be a lot safer for all of us if we throw the Wraith off your trail before we get there. Okay. Turn around. - If you try anything... - Just turn around. Do you see it? What did you see? Your tracking device... It's different... It's much more complicated. It's branched out, fused not only to your spine, but also your brain stem. Removing it would kill you. I'm sorry. We need to get moving. Okay. Nightfall, 17 minutes, but like I said, it's very brief. Like... Whitehorse in June. Oh, not that you have any idea what Whitehorse is, or June, for that matter... What the...? Holy crap! Did you see that thing? - This guy is good. - This guy's a killer! Good. - No one found it. - Found what? Her name is Celise. What happened to her? She fell, injured her leg. I did my best to clean the wound, but... It's infected. - When did this happen? - A few days ago. When she got worse, I went looking for a doctor. We went to three different planets. I heard people from Atlantis were helping the village here with their sickness. So I brought her here, found this cave to hide her, set a few traps to keep the Wraith or anyone else away, then waited for you to show up. You know, you could've just asked for my help instead of kidnapping me. I couldn't take that chance. Most people don't want anything to do with Runners. Is she your daughter? No. She lived in a village that was destroyed by the Wraith. Let me guess. You brought the Wraith there? I stayed there one night. I didn't think they'd find me that fast. The culled the whole village. Celise was the only person I could save. How bad is she? Very bad. Her blood pressure's dangerously low. She's septic, going into shock. - What does that mean? - It means the wound is necrotic. I'm gonna have to surgically debride it, cut away the dead tissue. I'm gonna start her on an IV antibiotic, but she needs much stronger medications than I have with me. She's a very, very sick girl. She can't die. You cannot let her die. I'll do what I can. I'll be close by. Oh. It's okay. It's okay, I'm here to help you. I gave you some medicine to numb your leg. Do you feel any pain? Good. That's good. Where's Kiryk? Kiryk. So that's his name. He's just outside, keeping watch, making sure you're safe. Okay? That's a beautiful doll. Kiryk made it for me. Mean old Kiryk, huh? Go figure. He's not mean. He just pretends to be. I know someone just like him. The signal's circling. Wherever he's taking her, I think they've arrived. - How long before daybreak? - Not long now. Maybe under an hour. It's pretty short. What are you doing? Shoot it! Don't move. - One less trap to worry about. - Is that supposed to be comforting? You scared me. How is she? I debrided the wound, cleaned it as best I could, but she's not out of danger, not by a long shot. She needs a much stronger antibiotic regimen, not to mention the probability of a skin graft. I'd like to take her to Atlantis. Our infirmary can provide her with the proper care she needs. - I can't go to Atlantis. - I know. You're gonna have to trust me with her care. As long as you return her to me when she's healed. Kiryk, you have to understand something. There's no guarantee she'll survive. She's still very sick. But if she survives... being constantly hunted by the Wraith is no life for a child. You know that. If you really want her to live, you need to let her go. If I knew that she would... What is it? Kiryk? What happened? The Wraith stunned you. Almost killed Celise. Couldn't revive you. They must've hit you with a triple dose of whatever is in those stunners. I knew we had to get away from the cave, so I carried Celise here, and then I went back, and literally dragged you the distance. Not an easy task, let me tell you. How is she? Stable, for the time being. But her fever is still very high. The longer she stays on this planet, the greater the danger. I'll carry her. We'll head back for the Gate. With the Wraith closing in on us? How far do you think we're gonna get? A lot farther than you trying to carry her yourself. Okay, look. I've been thinking. I may not be able to remove the tracking device, but there might be a way to disable it. This machine... It's called a defibrillator. It creates a powerful electric shock to restore someone's heart to the proper rhythm, and I think, if I can place the paddles on the skin directly above your tracking device, I might be able to overload the power source. Fry the circuits. All right. Do it. Okay, but you should know that there's no guarantees this is gonna work, and it also carries a lot of risk. If it works, the device will be disabled. If it kills me... Same thing. The Wraith won't be able to track me anymore. It's time to stop running. It's not too much further. Promise me you'll make sure she's cared for. I promise. The charge moves from one paddle to the other. And your tracking device is gonna be directly between them. Okay? All right. Ready? Okay, here we go. What the hell? - What? - I don't know, it just... Suddenly stopped transmitting. We lost them. Come on... You okay? What happened? I lost you for a moment. But you're back in the land of the living. Did it work? I think so. The device isn't transmitting any signals. I think we successfully fried the sucker. What? - I guess we fried that, too. - Doesn't matter. Don't need it anymore. Actually... I know someone who would love to inspect a gadget like that. Anything? What? A body was dragged through here. - You got something? - Yeah. Two bodies laid here. Ground cover's trampled in two spots. So the Wraith got to them before we did? I don't think so. I don't see any Wraith footprints. So what happened? What, they killed each other? No one's dead. At least they weren't when they were here. Look. One body was dragged through here... - By Keller... Her footprints. - So she killed him. Probably by disabling his tracking device. Nah. She didn't kill him. He was unconscious. His footprints, side-by-side with hers, leaving the clearing that way. So she brought him here unconscious, revived him, and they left together? - Looks like it. - Wait. Said there were two bodies. - So, what, she took a nap? - No. Too small for Keller. My guess is someone else is with them. Probably a child. But no footprints? No. - She was carried here. - She? How could you possibly know the kid was a girl... Darts. Looks like we're not the only ones who noticed his signal died. Could sure use that teleportation device now. There's a path down not too far from here. Stay here. I'll check to make sure it's still safe. Ronon, wait! - Make him stop! - What? Why? Ronon, please! Stop! Help me. Grab her! Stop! He just wanted me to help the little girl. She's sick! She's dying. We need to get her back to Atlantis. Please? Jennifer, the... Her sutures have torn. I need to restitch her before we can move her. You got Wraith looking for you. I know. You stand a better chance fighting them than fighting each other. Obviously the odds of actually winning are still ridiculously low, but... Not helping. I'm gonna go... He's right. This place is gonna be swarming with Wraith. It's better off if we work together. - All right, she's ready. - Let's go. Wraiths! Oh, crap. - Shoot him! - I will! Where'd you learn to fight like that? Been taking a few sparring lessons. We need to move. I tried to stabilize her, but she needs stronger medication. You could've asked for her assistance as opposed to kidnapping her. He knows, Rodney. Here, I got you something. - It's a kinda teleportation device. - Teleportation? Really? Well, it was, anyway. I kinda broke it. Is she family? I brought the Wraith to her village. She's the sole survivor. It's not easy... living with that. Don't worry. We're gonna get you outta this. Both of you. I count six Wraith. Six that we can see. Probably more in the surrounding woods. Want to make a run for it? Shoot our way through? The ships will be alerted as soon as the shooting starts. - We'll be culled before we can dial. - Just gonna have to take our chances. You fixed it! I don't know about "fixed". It's incredibly complicated technology. I'm not sure if it'll actually... What're you doing? I'm gonna improve our chances. Don't go down there by yourself. I'll be fine. Get ready to attack that clearing. Look, just wait a second, all right? I'm not sure if I actually fixed it. You'll need to test it before you... I guess I did fix it. He's at the Gate! Stay with them. He's dialing the Gate. We've gotta get a move on. All right, we'll take her to the Gate, then I'll go back, tell people it's safe to return to the village. No, as they fly up, you wanna use that button there to shoot them. Shoot the ducks? They're not real ducks, obviously. They're just, you know, for pretend... Maybe you should show her a different game. Yeah, sure. Here. Well, how's our little patient? Oh, much better. She's a heck of a fighter. Is he bothering you? Because I can have him removed. - Forcibly. - Really? Yeah. He's kidding. I talked to one of the families on 985... The woman's home we visited? She'd love to have Celise come live with them. That's great. Will I see Kiryk again? - I don't know, sweetheart. - We're still looking for him. Keeping our eyes and ears open. Hey, I brought you something. I think you dropped this in the woods... My doll. - What? - Okay... Here's the thing. I've been thinking. And, I need to know your intentions. - Intentions? - With Jennifer? I don't have any intentions. - Good. - Wait. What do you mean by "intentions"? I mean, are you interested in her in a... romantic... fashion? Good. Wait. What? Maybe I do. Have... Intentions. Do you have intentions? Of course I do. That's why I was asking you. So what are we gonna do about it? I don't know. I'm not gonna fight you for her. - Great! - Not gonna step aside, either. So... We're just gonna have
