The retrovirus works. Just look at the guy. - l’m returning to what l am. - <i>Our dear lieutenant rejoined the Wraith.</i> He’s taken the knowledge that Atlantis still exists. We’ve detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis. l think we can assume it’s Michael. Your retrovirus will allow us to feed off enemy Wraith. - Receiving transmission. - What is, exactly ? Everything you’ve wanted to know about Wraith technology. Once we get in range, we beam a canister into the CO2 chamber and : One hive ship de-Wraithified. There’s been a change in plans. Two hive ships on our position. One of them is the friendly. The queen wants you to witness the fruits of your labor. Within the ship’s schematics was a worm-like computer virus. What did they get ? The location of every world in our database. With 302s, we might take out the hyperdrive, save us some time. Do it. Shields are at 60 percent. - <i>I’ve got incoming.</i> - Daggers 3 and 4... - ... try to keep these Darts off our six. - Roger that. Half the bogeys are pursuing Daggers 3 and 4. We got the other half hot on our tail. l’m taking fire. l’ve lost a generator. Stand by to break left on my mark. Mark. Fox 4. We’re in the clear. Continue to target. Shields are under 20 percent. Get your flight back to the ship. We need to jump out of here. Two minutes and I can shut down their hyperdrives. Unless you can shut down their weapons it’s not gonna do much good. Damn it. Dagger 2, l could use some cover on my attack run of the target. Roger that, leader. I’m on my way. The Darts are returning to the hives. Can you go to max thrust ? Negative. - Head back to the <i>Daedalus</i>. - <i>Roger that.</i> The hives are opening hyperspace windows. Why the hell did they do that ? Three of our 302s are returning to <i>Daedalus</i>, sir. - Sheppard ? - His fighter isn’t one of them. The only contacts l have on-screen are wreckage. - What about his locator beacon ? - Nothing, sir. He’s just gone. Understood. Okay, this is new. Colonel Caldwell, what’s the status of the repairs ? Ongoing. We lost a few key personnel in the attack. Yes, we did. l’m sorry. So am l, but this isn’t the time to mourn them. l’ve just briefed General Landry. We’re to check in and advise him of our response. l’ve got a broken ship and casualties. l don’t know what you have in mind-- - l want you to redeploy immediately. - Excuse me ? As long as they’re still in striking distance we have to try. You know we can’t intercept them in hyperspace. - Radek ? - Well, obviously they’ve upgraded... ... their FTL drives using the information from our database. - The <i>Aurora</i> mission. - Obviously. However, their ships are organic in nature. They will need to make brief pauses to recover from hyperspace radiation. - Where and when ? - It will take some time to calculate. - Go. - Okay. Dr. Weir, l wanna go after these bastards as much as you do... ... but the <i>Daedalus</i> is in no position to fight right now. Our shields are depleted. Several decks are inaccessible. Even if we could catch up, l don’t know how long we’d last. Which is why l’m committing the <i>Orion</i> as well. It was recalled the moment the virus was revealed. - It’s in no better shape than <i>Daedalus</i>. - It will fly. And by the time you reach the hive ships it should also be able to fight. - And if it isn’t ? - Currently, Stargate Command... ... has no vessels capable of engaging the hive ships before they reach Earth. They cannot be allowed to get that far, Steven. You know what you’re asking me to do ? l do. There’s still repairs that need to be made. Do what you have to do. They couldn’t have. If they deduced the location of Earth... ... they wouldn’t be able to get there, unless they... They downloaded something along with the hive-ship plans. Something like spyware. It’s like when l stupidly downloaded por-- Music, when l downloaded music. l asked them to do it. l did this. l’m responsible for the destruction of my own planet. Anybody was gonna do it, it’d be you. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much for that. Stop worrying now. Just focus. On what ? What is there to focus on ? l’m stuck in a cocoon. - Getting out of here. - Right. Of course. Why didn’t l think of that ? Of course. Here goes. Nope, still can’t move. l’m pretty sure they’re struggle-proof there, big guy. Okay, can’t sit here forever. Hit them while they’re in hyperspace, they’Il never know what happened. Is that even possible ? There’s no reason to believe their hyperspace field is different... ... and we can’t launch 302s while in hyperspace. l’m talking about maneuvering within the field, not passing through it. What do you think ? - Colonel ? - What ? Yes. He’s not listening. l gotta pay more attention to those guys. Yes, Michael ? You should have told me... ... that we were going to betray the Atlanteans. - Are you feeling sympathy for them ? - No. But l don’t understand why l wasn’t told. l told you their plan because l believe it was a viable way-- You are only alive because you still may prove to be useful. But l fear, Michael... ... that the lingering stench of what they’ve transformed you into... ... will never fade. In approximately one hour, the Wraith will drop out of hyperspace... ... here. It’s just outside of the Pegasus galaxy. There they will pause for 15 hours. If <i>Daedalus</i> and <i>Orion</i> break orbit on our current schedule... ... they should reach those coordinates... ... in just under 14 hours, best possible speed. Narrow window. It’s the only window, sir. Understood. Now, the International Oversight Advisory... ... wants you to brief them on this matter. - <i>When would you like me to dial again ?</i> - You misunderstand me. l mean in person, and l mean right now. - <i>The president himself is--</i> - l can’t just leave. Not now. l’m afraid that’s not up to you. - There is far too much going on here. - <i>Doctor.</i> You’ve done all you’re going to do for now. l need you to step through that gate. They’re waiting for you in my briefing room. Dr. Weir ? l see. Teyla, we are awaiting several teams to return from their missions. Once that happens, l’d like to suspend gate travel till this is over. Of course. l’Il need you to dial in once the <i>Daedalus</i> is ready. l know what to do, Élizabeth. Of course you do. - l will see you when you return. - Thank you. Welcome back to Earth. Thank you, general. It’s wonderful to be here. l can see that. You know, l considered disobeying your order. There wouldn’t have been too much you could do. You made the right decision in coming. We’re in the middle of a crisis. This is absolutely-- Don’t bite my head off, Élizabeth. The recall order didn’t come from me. Who it came from doesn’t matter. What if l told you it came from the president ? l wouldn’t believe you. And you’d be right. But in a couple of weeks, there could be aliens on our doorstep... ... determined to feed on the human race. The president had no choice but to accede to the l. O.A.’s demand... ... that you be brought back to explain. So, what do they really want ? To point fingers, cover their asses. l am honestly not sure how l will respond to that, sir. They’re bureaucrats, Élizabeth. You’Il have them for breakfast. There is work l must attend to. Stand aside ! Am l to sit quietly in my quarters ? You know, these are actually quite comfortable. Surprisingly warm, take all the pressure off the spine. They’re as good a place as any to witness the end of humanity. You’re wasting your energy talking. Okay, let’s say a magic fairy comes down... ... and grants you one wish, and we break out ? Then what, huh ? We’re in a hive, traveling through hyperspace... ... probably in the massive void between our two galaxies... ... where there aren’t even planets, let alone stargates. What then, huh ? We fly home on the wings of imagination ? - Is that what we do, Ronon ? - You can sit here and die... ... but l’m not giving up. - Oh, fine. l will. - Fine ! Okay, time to do some damage. Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me ? Rodney ? I know this is a long shot, but if you can hear me, please respond. If you’re near a radio, I need you to come in. I need to know your location. Guys ? Colonel Sheppard. - <i>Is that you ?</i> - Who’s this ? - You know me as Michael. - Sorry, got the wrong number. Ronon and Dr. mcKay are still alive. - What are you gonna do with them ? - If you want them to live, listen to me. If your friends are in pursuit, you need to disable these ships for them to reach us. If you really wanna help, why don’t you just do that ? - They would know. - Aren’t you « they« ou » ?? Please believe me when l say l was as deceived as you were. Oh, l don’t know. l was pretty deceived. It seems that because of what you did to me... ... the Wraith no longer see me as one of their own. That’s why you wanna help, because you don’t feel welcome. - We don’t have time to discuss this. - <i>Sure we do. I’ve got...</i> ... a good three hours of air left. - Where are you ? - Wouldn’t you like to know ? l need to know what level you’re on so l can guide you from there. You mean trust you ? Are you in a position not to ? l’ve got you right where l want you. I doubt I will be allowed to live much longer... ... and yet l very much want to continue living. If you want to survive as l do... ... then l suggest you tell me where you are. l’m outside the hive in a 302 about to blast your ship. You still wanna help ? Targeting the ventral hyperdrive would be most effective. Yeah, that’s what l was thinking. Then I suggest you act now before you are discovered. The leader of the hive presented a scenario... ... which made it seem we were under a time constraint. To speed up the problem solving, we distributed the file. And played right into their hands. Yes. In fairness, Dr. Weir kept us informed of every action they took along the way. And we supported her recommendations, l know. But clearly, we were not in possession of all of the facts. Obviously, neither were we, ambassador. What measures have you taken to prevent the Wraith from reaching Earth ? l was coordinating a strike when you recalled me. With what ? - With everything we’ve got. - Is that wise ? General Landry has informed me... ... that in light of fleet resources committed to fighting the Ori... ... the weapons platform in Antarctica... ... powered by a pair of Mark-ll generators would be Earth’s only defense. l believe it would be better to stop them while they’re within reach of Atlantis. Wouldn’t it have been more prudent... ... to send the ZPM back to Earth on the <i>Daedalus</i>... ... ensuring successful operation... ... of the weapons platform when the Wraith arrive ? The <i>Daedalus</i> suffered severe damage during the first battle. A long journey at full power was out of the question. There is no way of knowing how much faster the Wraith ships have become. You’d risk the lives of everyone aboard those ships... ... in order to undo your mistake ? Daedalus is in orbit above Atlantis, performing emergency repairs. There is still time to beam the ZPM aboard. But either plan will require <i>Daedalus</i> to break orbit within the next hour. Then if you’Il excuse us, we need some time to discuss our options. l have instructed Atlantis to contact the SGC... ... when both <i>Daedalus</i> and <i>Orion</i> are ready to leave. If you’d like to overturn my standing orders at that time, go ahead. But you will have to fire me first. Wonder what they’Il do to us. Feed on us probably. l mean, that’s... That’s what they do. It’s not gonna come to that. Maybe. Earth will probably mount some kind of defense. In which case, death would be instantaneous. Unless we’re trapped on a deck with a fire or something. Then we’d be burned alive. Well, burned alive or suffocate. l wonder which would be worse : Being life-sucked by the Wraith, or burned alive. l couldn’t consider two worse options. - Stop talking. - Okay, you know what ? Make me. What are you doing ? Where did you get that ? l was trying to get my hand free so l could get it. Would it have killed you to tell me ? Maybe l would have if you’d shut up for more than a minute. What ? Don’t just stand there. Cut me loose. Only if you put an end to all this « we’re gonna die, there’s no hope « talk. Well, now there’s hope. Get ready. A little help with this ? - It’s freezing out here. - Would you prefer to go back in ? - No. - So now what ? - What ? - How do we get out of here ? - Well, l don’t-- - What ? - You said no more death talk. - Okay. We’re out of the cocoons. So what ? We’re still on the ship. There’s no way off it. - Well, any survivable way. - You’Il think of something. - It’s not a question of thinking. - You’Il think of something. Fine. Can we at least go somewhere else ? Can you get this off me ? It’s down my back. It’s down my back. Just... So, what do they wanna do ? They’re still arguing about it. - Of course they are. - Incoming wormhole. This is Atlantis. We have a scheduled check-in with Dr. Weir. Stand by, Atlantis. They haven’t reached a decision. And they don’t want to, Mr. Woolsey. If they agree or disagree with me, then they have to take some responsibility. They’d rather have someone to blame. l give this order... ... either way, they have a scapegoat. It’s all part of the game. Ma’am ? Teyla. Yes, Élizabeth. Tell Colonel Caldwell to proceed with the mission as planned... - ... and Godspeed. - <i>I will tell him.</i> Hermiod, what’s our status ? Shields are at full strength. l’ve rerouted nonessential power... ... in order to ensure power levels for a longer period. l want all missile tubes loaded with Mark-lll tactical warheads. - That would be every one. - l’m aware of that. Disable all firing safeties to launch every one of our missiles... - ... the moment we exit hyperspace. - l’m not sure that’s possible. - Make it possible, please. - Yes, sir. major Lorne, we’re approaching our T-zero. Zelenka says she’Il fly, sir, but as of right now that’s about all she can do. You’Il have 13 hours to get your weapons and shields online. We need to leave now to make this window. Are you go or no-go ? We’re a go, sir. Very well. On my mark : Three, two, one, mark. You sure McKay and Ronon are nowhere near the area l’m about to light up ? l’m certain. Good luck. Thanks. It’Il be a walk in the park. A very scary park... ... filled with monsters who are trying to kill me. - <i>I don’t understand.</i> - Never mind. Operation This-Will-Most-Likely-End-Badly is a go. Target is destroyed. Disable the second hive quickly. Their fighters will be headed your way. How about this help you were talking about ? - <i>I told you, target the hyperdrive.</i> - l already knew that. - There’s nothing l can do. - Like hell there isn’t. Call off the Darts. They won’t listen to me. This is not helpful, Michael. Dr. Weir ? What can l do for you, Mr. Woolsey ? The ambassadors have finished convening. Oh, good timing. Yes. They’d like to continue debriefing you now. - Yeah, l bet they would. - Excuse me ? No. l’m not gonna sit there and have them rake me over the coals... ... about every decision l’ve made that they don’t agree with in hindsight. l have the greatest respect for you but as far as the l. O.A. is concerned... ... you’re not exactly the employee of the month. If the Wraith make it to Earth, keeping my job will be the least of my concerns. - And if your plan succeeds ? - Then l expect to keep my job, yes. Because l did what they apparently are incapable of doing. l made a decision. The fact is, at this point, there is nothing more... ... we can do but wait and see what happens. But give them my best. We have been walking around here for a day and l haven’t seen one exit sign. Sooner or later, l’Il have to eat something. - l think l have a plan. - You ? Really ? - You know a lot about these ships, right ? - Maybe. Why ? If l get you to a panel, how much damage could you do ? - What ? - Overload the engines and blow the ship ? - How is that an escape plan ? - l never said it was. - That’s a plan ? - You said there’s no way out. - If we’re dead, let’s take them with us. - l’d rather die a hero than a meal. - You can do it ? - Yeah, probably. Now you’re talking. You should not be here. She asked me to question the prisoner. If you’d prefer to discuss it with her... Release him. l will take him from here. You had me worried there. You’ve slowed them down, at least for a little while. We need to get to a ship, hope your friends find us. Not till we free Ronon and McKay. We’re headed toward them now. Now, that’s what l call help. Exiting hyperspace in 10 seconds. Launch the moment the target’s acquired. Don’t wait. Five, four, three-- - Missiles are away. - Dart activity ? Quite a number of them. They’re moving to intercept our missiles. Now would be a good time, <i>Orion</i>. What the hell ? One of your ships has launched an attack. Their strike inflicted damage on this hive. Good. The other was undamaged. Your vessel’s continuing to engage. Are you gonna go through the play-by-play or get out of here ? This way. - Ship’s engaged in battle. - With who ? - Doesn’t matter. - Matters to us. - Why ? - If it’s our guys... ... our chance went back above zero, fractionally. If it’s our guys, all the more reason to damage this ship and help them. Move it. One missile got through, sir. One of the Wraith ships suffered damage but the other one-- The <i>Orion</i> has arrived. The hive is moving to intercept. - They launched their weapons ? - Negative, sir. Open a secure channel. major Lorne, now would be a good time to open fire. Yes, l was thinking the same. l gave the order, but nothing happened. Zelenka ? l’m trying ! We’re having difficulty transferring power from shields to weapons. - There’s a hive bearing on your position. - <i>Yes, sir. I see.</i> - Stand by. Doc, you’re killing us. - Okay. l have it. Firing drones. The remaining hive is shifting their attack to <i>Orion</i>. Move to intercept. Orion has no shields. We’re not gonna make it there in time, sir. Where are they ? l’m sorry. They must have been taken for feeding. No, no. These were cut from the inside. They escaped. They could be anywhere on this ship. Well, that’s a start. Why ? What could their objective possibly be ? If l know Ronon, they’re somewhere they can do much damage. And McKay would know where and how to do that, so... There’s a control station this way. One more shot, that’s all l’m asking. l just cannot give you what l don’t have. There’s too much damage. We need to abandon ship. - Listen to me. - We sacrificed our shield capability... ... for that first salvo. This ship is going to blow any moment, major. Caldwell, l’m afraid we’ve done everything we can on our end. Request immediate beam out to <i>Daedalus</i>. Get them over here. Their operating system is a mess. Thank goodness l remember DOS. - Trust me, that was hilarious. - Have you done it yet ? Look, this ship has been seriously damaged. It’s hard for me to find something to overload. Let Mikey try. - He’s helping us. - Where did you come from ? l latched onto the hull before it went into hyperspace. - Nice move. - Saw it in a movie once. - We gotta get to the <i>Daedalus</i>. - The <i>Daedalus</i> is here ? - We need to get to the transport. - Why should l trust you ? Because l’m trusting you. Because l said so. - l don’t like this. - You got a better idea ? We take the ship on our own and leave him here. He’s the reason l’m alive now. l don’t think that’s possible. It took days to crack the Dart interface. - This ship is bigger. - l don’t like it. - Yeah, l get it. You hate the Wraith. - Him in particular. Is there anything to boost a signal ? l wanna reach the <i>Daedalus</i> as soon as possible. - Well, l could try. - Hang on. They’Il open fire on us the second we leave the bay. Oh, great. The day just gets better and better. - Sorry, sir. We did our best. - Nothing to apologize for. Bring guns to bear on the Dart bays. Hold fire till l order. Channel every ounce of power to the forward shield until then. l have a contact. Single Wraith ship, possibly a transport. Just left the hive and is on a course for us. - It’s broadcasting on our frequencies. - What do they want ? - Maybe they want to surrender ? - Not likely. Let’s hear it. This is Sheppard, authentication code Alpha-Seven-Tango-Three. Please respond. Open a channel. Colonel Sheppard, we’d written you off. Don’t get all emotional on me now. I’ve got mcKay, Ronon and michael aboard a Wraith transport. - Michael ? - <i>Yes, sir.</i> He’s got a plan you’Il like. It won’t be long before they start shooting at us. - The hive opened fire on the transport. - Beam them directly to the bridge. - Colonel. - You said something about a plan ? l’ve disabled their jamming code. It’s a matter of time before they realize. - All you have to do is send a nuke. - We deployed all our warheads. - The hive is launching Darts. - Open up on those bays, all batteries. Shut that off ! - Report. - The plan worked, sir. The concentrated fire on the bays created secondary explosions. - They’ve stopped firing. - Nice work, colonel. A draw is a win for our side. Ship status ? Shields completely depleted. We’re venting atmosphere. Seal off all affected decks. That last blast took out life support. The backups aren’t responding. Right now, we’re shallow-breathing. - Meaning ? - Meaning that in under nine hours... ... we’re all gonna suffocate. As long as we don’t worry about shields and weapons... ... we may be able to cannibalize parts from other systems... ... in order to create a CO2 filtration system. By the time we got that up and running... ... the CO2 levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers we concoct. - But it’s worth a try. - Yes, but regardless... ... we need more electricians and welders than are certified on this ship. Anyone, and l mean anyone, who took shop needs to report to us. - Teams assembling on every deck. - Good, good. Now we’re talking. How many more of these do we have ? - Twenty in total. - How many people onboard ? In and around the 200 mark. Buddy-breathing our way through is out of the question. - l’m afraid so, sir. Yes. - Okay, fine. They’re for people working on life support. - We need those people clear-headed. - By « those people« ou » ?-- ? - l’Il be one. - How many levels inaccessible ? - Seven. - We need to find out... ... if there’s pockets of atmosphere. We may squeeze another hour... - ... from the regions sealed off. - We can’t transfer the O2... - ... where we need. - We could-- We’Il be able to access panels closed off. Get Sheppard in a 302. He can eyeball it from the outside. l’Il take this. These sections are completely open to space, Rodney. There aren’t even pockets you could beam into. What about an EVA ? Space suits were stored in those sections. - <i>All right, I’m heading back.</i> - Copy that. Have you tried routing from the inertial-- ? Yes, yes, yes. We have tried everything. Subspace communications ? We are floating between two galaxies, Radek. Atlantis has no ship to send. Even if we were able to repair the array and get a message back to Earth... ... it would still take them weeks to get a rescue here. l wasn’t thinking of rescue. l was thinking of telling them that we’ve stopped the Wraith. Letting someone know the sacrifice we’ve done. Well, a noble sentiment, but l would prefer to dedicate... ... my last breath of air to getting more air. Wait a second. The only air within light years is on the Wraith ship. There’s also Wraith aboard that Wraith ship, doctor. So we take them. Beam an assault team in. You would be far outnumbered. Well, we’re dead here. l’Il take my chances. l admire your courage, colonel, but you would be dead there as surely as here. Unless we send over the gas. Yes, yes, yes. That could work. The retrovirus gas would make them virtually harmless. - Do we still have it onboard ? - Yes, we do. Michael’s disabled their jamming codes-- - We finish the plan we started. - We beam over the gas and wait. We wait long enough, they won’t wanna put up a fight. They’Il be humans with no memories. l might actually survive this. We’re almost out of air. The retrovirus takes 10 hours to run its course. Yeah, well, we’Il rotate the crew in and out of the 302s. If this works, can you fly the hive ship ? l could. What do you say, colonel ? Weaps, get us within beaming range of the hive. Yes, sir. - Anything ? - No. No contacts yet. Our tests of the Mark-ll generator and the chair in Antarctica are promising. « Promising. » That doesn’t sound very promising. We’re fairly confident the Ancient weapon will take care of the hive ships... ... but doing so will probably require the last of our drones... ... and there goes our secret weapon. We’d really rather not have to do that. How’d it go with the l. O. A ? Oh, you know. l mean, does anyone ever come out of an l. O.A. deposition saying : « That went well« ou » ?? No, l don’t suppose they do. It was what it was. At least most of the time you’re a galaxy away. That Woolsey guy is here almost every other week. l think they’re gonna ask me to step down. Well, if they’re just gonna ask, you can always say no. l messed this one up, general. Yeah, you did. l lost some of the best people-- You proceeded with the blessing of the l. O.A. And Stargate Command, as l recall. Somehow, that doesn’t seem to help much. Success is not final. Failure is not fatal. It’s the courage to continue that counts. And l think you’ve got that in spades. - Churchill ? - Yeah. Except for that last part about you. That was all me. - Get some sleep, Élizabeth. - Yes, sir. Our CO2 levels are getting dangerous, sir. The gas has barely had a chance to run its course. We don’t have much of a choice. We gotta go now. Some of them are dead. Looks like they killed each other. What’s happened ? All right. It’s all right. Find a holding area. Start marshaling the survivors there. The queen’s chamber should be that way. Hello ? You all right ? It’s okay. You’re gonna be all right now. Didn’t work on her. Beckett wondered if the females would be immune. Something you might’ve mentioned before she almost killed me. - l only thought of it now. - <i>Colonel Sheppard.</i> So far we haven’t run into a single Wraith, sir. Understood. Sheppard to <i>Daedalus.</i> - <i>Go ahead.</i> - You can start sending people over. They’re all human and the air is good. l think we’re out of the woods.
