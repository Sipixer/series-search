All right... look. I know you're probably panicking right now, but there's no time for that.</i> You need to focus. I'm sure you're wondering</i> who tied you to the desk. Well, the truth is, it was you. I mean, me. I did it because I needed you to get this message.</i> It would take too long to give you the explanation, and you wouldn't</i> remember it anyway so you're just going to have to trust me on this. Now,</i> You'll find a knife taped to the underside of your chair.</i> Find it, and cut yourself loose. Now, I need you to listen. It is vitally important that you find this woman.</i> I don't know where she is, but you have to find her. She can help.</i> Check the mess hall, maybe they took her to the brig, I don't know. Keep looking.</i> Don't worry about anything else. And for God's sake, don't trust anyone. Just find her and do it fast, because if you don't, hundreds of people</i> are going to die. Including you. The Projet-SG and SG-66 Teams Present: Season 4 Episode 06 - Tabula Rasa (v. 1.00) - Transcription by Sadgeezer http:projet-sg.net Katie! Rodney! - Hey, what are you doing here? - I heard you were back, and - I hadn't seen you for a while, so... - Yeah, I know. We have this whole new mainland to explore, and I've been bringing back samples all week. So I see. Anything interesting? Well, it's all pretty similar to what we found back on Lantia. We found a few new species. Oh, which reminds me, I've got a surprise for you. I found this guy hiding in some shrubbery. What is that? Well, it doesn't have a name yet but I'm thinking of calling it... Rodneyana Villosa. After you. Really? - What... you can do that? - Yeah. Be careful. The bristles will pierce skin. Anyway, look, I wondered if I could... you know, tear you away from all of this long enough to have some lunch? Oh, I would love to, but... I think I'm coming down with something. I have a headache, and I've had a few dizzy spells, so I was thinking of going down to the infirmary. Well, I'll come with you. No, you don't have to do that. I know how much you hate being around sick people. No, really, it's fine. Oh, that is so sweet. - Thanks. - After you. Dr. Brown... I see you've brought my number one patient. What? Oh, no, we're not here for me this time. I'm-I'm here for her. Okay, well, what can I do for you? Well, I've got this really bad headache that won't go away, and I feel kind of dizzy. - When did you first notice it? - Some time this morning. Why? Well because you're the fourth person to come in here with those exact symptoms and the second person from the botany department. Gerald? Hey... - Who's that? - Gerald Baxter. He's on my team. You've met him before. He's got the bug collection? Oh, sure, right, yeah. I remember now. Well, I'm gonna need to take some blood. - You, too, Doctor. - What? If there is something going around, you might have been exposed to it as well. Sorry. Major Dorsey and his team just returned from M6R-214. They examined the debris field above the planet and found the parts from one, - possibly two, Replicator ships. - It was just a matter of time before the Wraith got organized and started hitting back. I suppose. They did defeat the Ancients, after all. The Replicators may look like the Ancients and they may use the same technology but they're gonna be tougher to put down. Colonel Carter, come in, please. Go ahead, Doctor. I've got a situation developing. Be advised I've imposed a quarantine on the entire infirmary level.</i> - What's going on? - 11 patients</i> have shown up here in the last hour, complaining of headache and dizziness. Eight of them are from the survey teams - <i>that just got back from the mainland.</i> - Any idea what's wrong with them? I ran some blood tests and found a bacteria I've never seen before. I'm checking it against the Ancient database.</i> What do you want us to do? The first thing we need to do is isolate everyone that went to the mainland and have them report to Dr Neves in the auxiliary med lab for testing. Will do. Keep us posted. More test results. You and I are both infected. So's Dr. Mckay. The good news is the most advanced case is still only showing mild, flu-like symptoms. - Maybe it won't get worse than that. - Yeah, let's hope so. Hello? Hey... hey, wake up. What are you doing here? - I don't know. - What are you doing? You're not a soldier. If you say so. - You should come with me. It's safer. - No, slow down. What's going on here? It's the soldiers. They're after us. If they catch us, they'll take us away. Take us where? What soldiers? What is this place? - Shut up. The soldiers will hear us! - What the hell's going on? - Why can't I remember? - <b>I don't know.</b> - No one can. - No one can? - You've seen others? - Yes, one or two others, apart from the soldiers. - What about her? Was she there? - No. I have to find her. - Why? - I don't know. It's important. The soldiers probably have her by now, okay? - Well, can we ask them? - Are you crazy? If the soldiers see you, they shoot you, take you away. Again with the taking away. - You should hide with me. - I can't, I've to keep looking. Fine, suit yourself. If you get yourself killed, I don't care. It started suddenly, and then it just... just stopped. Okay, well, I appreciate you telling me. Aren't you going to do anything? To be honest, I don't see how it's relevant. It's a new symptom. I thought it might be important. I don't see how a "tingling sensation in your knees" relates to this condition, especially since you're the only one experiencing it. Yeah, but, so far. I'm just saying, we don't know anything about this disease. The best thing for you to do right now is try to relax, okay, and let me do my work. - Here you go. - Thank you. What did Dr. Keller say? She's going to... take it into consideration. Thanked me for my input and... how you doing? I'm okay. Dr. Keller's got her team working pretty hard. I'm sure they're trying a bunch of stuff. I'm sure they'll come up with a way to beat this thing in no time. Seriously, are you okay? It's... my headache. It's getting worse. Is there anything I can do? Could you... ask the nurse to bring me some tea? What's wrong with this one? Right. Marie? What's... what's going on? I don't know. I just got really dizzy. Are you telling us that the infection has breached hazmat protocol? I'm not entirely sure. It's possible she could have been previously exposed, but that would mean it's already spread much farther among the general population than we thought. I've got off-duty medical personnel conducting random blood tests around the City just to get a sense of where we're at.</i> Have we confirmed it came from the mainland? The plant and soil samples brought back by the botany department were negative, but it still seems like the most likely point of origin. What about the database? I haven't found a match yet, but I'm still looking.</i> There is one more thing. Since we have no idea what this disease does, or how it's spread, or even if our containment measures are having any effect, I... recommend we suspend all Gate travel immediately. Thank you, Doctor. How you feeling? I-I don't know. They brought dinner. This salisbury steak's actually quite good. And by the way, I asked Dr. Keller about your friend, Dr. Baxter. She says he's asleep, but apparently the fever's down. Who? Dr. Baxter. That's his name, right, the guy on your team? Where am I? What do you mean? You're in the infirmary. I brought you here, remember? Who are you? Hold it right there. I don't want to cause any trouble. I just... Yeah, put him with the others. - Go and get him out of here. - Yes, Sir. What's the word? Well, the random test results came back. Six different people working in six different areas of the City,</i> all positive. That doesn't sound very promising. It's either a statistical miracle, or the entire base has been exposed. We're running more tests to confirm it, but it doesn't look good.</i> I don't know about you, but I feel fine. Me too, and that's the problem. If there is a delay before the first symptoms appear, it could've spread anywhere before we even knew what was happening. I've informed Stargate Command that we're suspending Gate operations. - Colonel Carter, this is Dr. Keller. - Go ahead. I'm sending you scans on Katie Brown, as well as three other patients who are beginning to show signs of amnesia. All of them show large concentrations of affected cells</i> in the medial temporal lobe. It looks like the bacteria is causing these cells to produce a hormone that interferes with the brain's ability to access episodic memory. How bad are we talking? Rate of deterioration seems to vary from patient to patient, but, in all cases, it looks like it's progressive, meaning, the longer they go without treatment, the worse it gets. Pretty soon, they won't be able to remember their own names.</i> You said the first symptoms were headaches and dizziness. Yeah, that's right. How long after they appeared before the first signs of memory loss? Again, it seems to vary, but you're looking at an average of about six hours. What about you, Doc, showing any signs? Yeah, the headaches started half an hour ago. All right, keep searching the database. It still think it's our best bet to find a solution. I'd love to, but if we're right about these numbers, I'm about to get overrun with a lot of new patients. It's already pretty crowded in here.</i> Mess hall. We can clear it out and make a temporary ward. That's a good idea. At the very least, it'll consolidate everyone in one place for treatment. Do it. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Where am I? We were hoping you could tell us. Who are all you people? We don't know. None of us can remember anything. What's happening out there? What did you see? Nothing. It was just... empty hallways. How did I get here? The soldiers brought you. Why? They bring everyone here. They say it's for our own protection. Don't waste your time. It won't open. Why are they doing this to us? Why can't anyone remember? My... the computer. - Where's my computer? - It... wasn't with you when they brought you here. Why? I have to find someone. It's a... a woman. Do you know who that is? Does anyone here know Teyla? Anyone? I thought this City had some sort of automatic lockdown to prevent stuff like this.</i> It does. Oh, yeah? What happened? You're asking me? You got a headache? I guess it was just a matter of time. I'm fine. How you feeling? I am fine. - Any symptoms? - No, none yet. Me neither. What is it? How do they know we're all infected? My blood wasn't part of the sample that was tested. Nor was mine. Even so, it is likely we were exposed. So? Being exposed doesn't mean you've got it. Maybe it doesn't affect everybody the same way, and all I know is I feel great. So do I. Perhaps you should make Dr. Keller aware of this. Excuse me. - I need to talk to you. - I'm a little busy right now. I'm not sick. If you're lucky enough not to be exposed, you just blew it by coming in here. No, I know I've been exposed. People I've been working with all day have been getting sick, but I'm not feeling anything. Neither is teyla. You think you might have some kind of immunity? You're the doctor. I'm going to need a sample of your blood. Take as much as you need. What are you doing? I have to remember somehow. I already feel certain things slipping away. - All right, now what are you doing? - Getting out of here. All right, everyone! Listen up! I need to escape as quickly as possible. - Does anyone know how I can do that? - You can't just leave. - Why not? - What about the soldiers? We're just going to have to deal with them. I'm sorry, call me crazy, but I don't exactly trust them. That doesn't mean we should be running loose. We have no idea what's out there. Look, something caused this to happen, We're not gonna figure it out from in here. Somewhere out there, there's a... a woman that... a woman named... Right, thank you. I think she knows something. What? I don't know. We got to get out there and find out. - I think we should listen to him. - Why? It makes sense. Why haven't the soldiers told us what's happened?</i> Why haven't there been any announcements, or any help on the way? Maybe they don't know any more than we do. We need a plan. They let you out? The second set of random blood tests just came back, all positive. Didn't see much point in quarantining the infirmary anymore. You showing any signs? - Headache? - Yeah, same here. Five bucks says you start losing your memories first. We've got food, water, and blankets. We don't have enough beds, but we're just gonna have to make do. We may need to think about ordering all non-essential personnel to report to the mess hall. They're gonna wind up there anyways, - we won't have people with no memories. - That's what I'm worried about. I'll send Lorne and a team out, make sure those orders are followed. These are from Dr. Neves. They're stimulants. He thinks they may slow the effects of the memory loss. It's just a stopgap, but - at least it may buy us a few hours. - Do we know what's in these? - Because I'm allergic to a lot of... - Take it. Hand these out to Lorne and his men. One more thing. I've ordered Dr. Zelenka to remove the Gate's main control crystal. No matter what happens, we cannot risk spreading this disease elsewhere in the galaxy, or to Earth. And what happens when we all start losing our memory? Dr. Keller will come up with something before that happens. I thought we were moving everyone to the mess hall. He's our most advanced case. His vitals are too unstable. What can I do for you? I was just wondering if you found anything. What do you mean? I'm not showing any sign of the disease, remember? Oh, well, it's possible you could have some sort of natural immunity. - Doc... - Stay here. I'm gonna take a sample of your blood... Doc... you've already done that. It's happening to me, isn't it? Doctor, he's convulsing! Okay... OK, give him... meda... medazelam, four milligrams. He's in V-fib. I need a crash cart. Charge it to two hundred. Clear. Charge it to three hundred... Clear. Go! Go! This way! All right, I think we're clear. Oh, thank God! My lungs were about to give out! So, what next? I don't know. How do we find her? Who? Teyla. The one we just risked our lives for. Right, right. I don't know. All right, we'll just have to search room by room. I mean, how big could this place possibly be? - Where are you taking us? - I already told you. The mess hall. I don't want to go there. Just relax. I know you're scared, you just to have to trust me. It's for your own good. So much for coming quietly. Hey... mess hall's this way. Right. Don't look at me that way. It's easy to get turned around in this place. Major Lorne's picking up some more stragglers. We're starting to get a little resistance. Yeah, they're starting to lose their memories. They can't understand why there's a bunch of soldiers after them. That's why I told him to take his men to the armory and equip them with stunners. I'm not sure I like the idea of us shooting at our own people. Well, we may not have a choice. Yeah, I suppose you're right. Pretty soon, there's going to be some panicked confused people out there. Okay, carry on. What? Come with me. You might want to go easy on that stuff, Major. Sir, we need to delay this thing as much as possible. If we all go, there's no coming back. Yeah, I know. That's what I want to talk to you about. I got an idea. - Didn't we come this way before? - No. Are you sure? No. I have an idea. What are you doing? If we come back here, we'll know we've been this way before. Presuming of course that we remember that we're the ones who put it there in the first place. I know you're out there. Drop your weapons and come out slowly. Little guy with glasses. - What are you doing? - Hey, I know him. Don't shoot. I don't have any weapons. Who are you? We were captured by the soldiers. We escaped. Really? Wait a second. What is that? - I found it. - Let me see. - What is it? - I don't know, but... something tells me it's important. Why? I don't know. Hey, how did you know to do that? - I don't know. I just did. - Well, that's her, Teyla. You know her? Well, not exactly. We're looking for her. We think she can help us. It says, "find her." How are we going to do that? This is what I wanted to show you. This is the bacteria that is causing our disease?</i> Not exactly, but it's very similar. And you found this in the database? I stopped looking in the database. I knew there was a reason why Teyla and Ronon are the only people</i> who've tested negative so far, and we don't have a lot of information on the Satedans, so I started looking through Dr. Beckett's records on the Athosians.</i> This is a blood sample taken from a 10-year-old boy. He was suffering from something called... I wrote it down. Kirsan fever? Yeah, that's it. It is a common childhood ailment throughout the galaxy. I had it when I was 8. I had it when I was 10. But this cannot be the same disease. Kirsan fever does not affect adults, nor does it cause memory loss. Well, that may be true but... the structure of the bacteria is too similar to ignore. They have to be related somehow. Wait a minute. Maybe they are the same. That would explain why the sensors didn't identify it as a threat. - How is that possible? - Well, think about it. I mean, this planet didn't have a Stargate until we came here. Maybe when the Ancients were first scouting this place,</i> they accidentally brought this... Kirsan fever with them. It got trapped here and over the course of 10,000 years it mutated to cause the symptoms we're now experiencing. That would also explain why you and Ronon aren't affected. You have antibodies built up from when you were young.</i> Well, if they have the antibodies, then... It would take months to reverse-engineer a cure. I mean, I'm not even sure it's possible. The sap of the enchuri plant. My people have used it for generations to combat Kirsan fever.</i> It is highly effective and not much is needed. - Let's go get some. - Take a Jumper. Wait a minute. You've disabled the Gate, remember? You ordered Doctor Zelenka to take the control crystal. Where did he put it? Zelenka, this is Sheppard. Come in. Check out the rooms down there and there. I want this section cleared out in ten minutes. Lorne, come in. - Yes, Sir, go ahead. - <i>You seen Zelenka?</i> As a matter of fact, I have. Did you bring him to the mess hall? Sorry, Sir, but he gave us the slip. Must have heard us coming. Cracked one of my people over the head with a metal rod and</i> disappeared down a service hatch before I could get a shot off. There's... no telling where he is now. Zelenka, respond? Zelenka, come in. Radek? We are not trying to hurt you. We need your help. OK, this is pointless. Look, we don't even know if he still has a radio, and even if we find him, he's not gonna remember where's the control crystal. - Let's face it: we're screwed. - There's gotta be some way out of this. What about the Jumpers? They've got DHDs. It doesn't matter. Without the crystal, the Gate can't establish a wormhole. We're not going anywhere. I'm missing something. I can't concentrate. What about the mainland? Ronon is right. The enchuri plant is abundant on many worlds. It may be here as well. All right. Assuming we can find the stuff, how're we gonna distribute it? I'll figure something out. I'll stay with Rodney. Do you know what to look for? It grows like a weed on Sateda. It's... right there. You can fly this thing. It's in your blood. Literally. Wait a second... what am I doing? You said, the quickest way to spread the cure was to aerosolize it and distribute it through the ventilation system. You are currently attempting to override base protocol for temperature, humidity, and air pressure. Right... right, okay, it's easy. Just a simple matter of accessing the root directory, and... - Come on! - Rodney... No, no, no, no. I should be able to do this in my sleep. Oh, God... it's happening to me too, isn't it? You have to remain calm. No, no. You don't understand. My memory was lousy. I mean, people's names, birthdays. I once forgot mother's day five years in a row. What is the ratio of circle's circumference to its diameter? Well, that's pi. It's 3.14159265, et cetera, et cetera. - That doesn't count. That's easy. - You are a scientist, Rodney. That is what you care about. That is what you will hang on to the longest. Right. Right, so... wait a minute. Doesn't that make me a really bad person? It makes you the type of person who is going to save all our lives. Oh, okay. What is this place? I don't know. Looks like they left in a hurry. - She's not here. Let's... - <i>Down here! This way!</i> Quiet! Go, go. All right, everybody, spread out. They got to be in here somewhere. Sir! Found 'em. Good. Let's go. Let's move out, come on. Can we get out of here, please? - What is it? - I have an idea. Come on. Let's go. Wait a minute. - What is this place? - The mainland. - What are we doing here? - I told you already. We need to get that plant. Something seems fishy. Never gets old. Sorry, buddy. You're just going to slow me down. How's it coming, Rodney? I'm just about finished... I think. What was that? I will go see. Keep working. Don't move! Major Lorne. - It's me, Teyla. - You shouldn't be out here. Major, it's me. Everyone's been ordered back to the mess hall. But Dr. Mckay and I... Put your hands on your head. Slowly. Teyla? Oh, God... All right, let's get her up. Come on... All right. Look, I know you're probably panicking right now, but there is no time for that. You need to focus. I'm sure you're wondering, who tied you to the desk... - You're awake. - Major Lorne, you must set me free... Save it. You're not going anywhere till I get some answers. I need to know what you've done to my people. What I've done? You believe I'm behind this? Is it a drug? Some kind of bio-weapon? Major, they're sick. You as well. The entire base is infected with a disease.</i> Everyone except you. Yes. I'm immune to its effects. Isn't that convenient? How many of those have you taken? Why don't you just let me worry about that, okay? It's the pills. They're what's making you act like this. They're confusing you. They're making you unstable. Making me unstable? I'm not the one who unleashed a disease on my people, okay? Quit stalling. I want to know what you were doing in the hall... Rodney! - Teyla? - Yes. It's good to see you. Colonel Carter, Dr. Zelenka, you as well. How did you find me? Well, we were having trouble finding you by ourselves, so we followed him. Did you finish your work? What do you mean? Can you disarm the force shield? I don't know. Quickly! Don't move! Drop it. Now back away. Now... Tell me... Who the hell are you? I know you don't remember everything. You have no idea what's going on. You're confused, maybe even a little scared. I know I would be. But you have to trust me. We're friends. The things we've been through together, I don't care what anyone says, no disease can wipe that away. Not completely. Okay, deep down, you know I'm telling the truth. - Now, give me the gun. - Oh, nice try. For all I know, you're the one who tied me up. Fine. Then shoot me, and you'll be all alone, in the middle of a dark forest, with no idea who you are, where you're going, or what you're going to do next. How could I possibly make it any worse? That's a good point. Here. Sit. Are you sure you wouldn't rather do it? - I do not know how. - And I do? Yes. You created the override program. - You said you were almost finished. - Oh, then it should be easy. Rodney, listen to me. You must do this, It is our only chance. The knowledge is inside you. You just have to find it. He did it. When I said I was almost finished, I guess I wasn't kidding. Now what? Well, now we just have to hope that colonel Sheppard and Ronon completed their side of the mission. Right. Right... - Who? - Who? What is it? A ship. Headed for the bay doors on the roof. Have they identified themselves? No, Sir. It could be help. It could also be some kind of an attack. Get in touch with the others. Tell them to meet me at the Jumper bay. And find major Lorne! - Nice flying. - Thanks. Come on, help me with this stuff. We got to get this to Teyla right away. Who? Come on. Hands in the air. Now. Listen, Lieutenant, this is medicine. - We need to deliver it. - I said, hands in the air. Let's take them to the brig. You're making a mistake. There are sick people who need that. You sure you know what you're doing? What the hell is going on here? Sir, we caught these men trying to infiltrate the base. Lorne, you have got to listen to me. Everybody on this base is going to die if you don't. - And who are you? - Look in your pocket. - What? - Just look in your vest pocket. You took a picture of him just in case it came to this.</i> I was there. He's telling the truth. This is our commanding officer. That's right. I am your commanding officer. So... you should do what I say. Yes, Sir. What are your orders? - Do what he says. - Gun. Follow me. Colonel, you're awake. What happened? Teyla distributed the plant through the ventilation system. Knocked you out for a bit. How long have I been asleep? About a day. A day? Hit some people harder than others. How are you feeling, John? How's your memory? Oh, pretty good, I think. I mean... things are a little fuzzy. If I forget your birthday next year... I will forgive you. When you are feeling well enough, major Lorne wishes to speak with you. He feels badly about what happened. It wasn't his fault. Just glad he still had the photo I gave him. - That was good thinking, by the way. - Yes. If the distribution of the cure had been delayed any longer, many more people would have died. What do you mean? Where's McKay? You should get some sleep. It's okay. I'm fine. I can let you know when she wakes up. I wanna stay. Okay. She's not giving up, you know. She's a fighter. Katie? Doctor! She's moving her fingers. Katie? Katie! Hello. Where am I? You're in the infirmary. You're safe.
