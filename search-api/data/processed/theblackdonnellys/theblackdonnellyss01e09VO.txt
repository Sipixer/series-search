to be an artist, right? Kate Farrell knew that. And she had a famous artist friend. I think it might be good for you to meet him. Dokey had a friend, too. Councilman Jack Trevor. Jack told Dokey he better start playin' nice with the Italians. Jimmy was all about playin' nice with others. Like Whitey's uncle, Bob the Mouth. But Bob wanted the money Jimmy owed him, and he wanted Jimmy dead. We both know your uncle's gonna wanna kill me. Bye-bye, Bob. So the bookmaking business was back to usual. (GRUNTING) Except for one tiny detail. Nicky found out they stole the book from him and he wanted the business back. Jenny wanted her dad back, the way he was before he started losin' his marbles. I lost a little memory, that's all. Yeah. And I'm on vacation in the Bahamas. Joey, the warden says you haven't been eating. Look around. I mean, this is it, forever. There's nothin' left to look forward to, no hopes, no dreams. It's a terrible thing to take away a man's dream. Try to sit up. Eat something. And we can discuss these feelings. That's the thing about most of us from the neighborhood, you know that? We all reach this point where there's nothin' left to aim for. But I'm gettin' ahead of myself. You know, maybe I will just have one of those carrots. See, Tommy Donnelly's dream was to pursue all that art crap. Now, it's a little gay for me, but for Tommy, it was the only thing other than Jenny Reilly that he ever really wanted. And he decided to go for it, once and for all. Hello? MUNST: In the back. You're Kate's friend. Tommy Donnelly. It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Munst. Mmm-hmm. (GROANS) What are you doing? I thought I would show you some of my... No, no. Hey! Seriously, seriously, put that away. Kate said you wanted to see some of my work. Please! I can't handle amateur crap this early in the morning. Maybe there's been some mistake. Kate said you wanted this job. Job? Are we having language issues here? The intern job. You want it? Depends. What do I have to do? Oh, now we got contingencies, right? No. I'll take it. All right. Get me some coffee, and here, some stuff I need done. There a problem? No. I'm on it. Well, not yet, you're not. If you was on it, I would see your tootsies movin'. Now, Jimmy had dreams too. But he didn't just want his name in lights, he wanted his whole life in lights. So he started with a new sign for the Firecracker. I don't get it. What's not to get? There's a flame and a cracker. Put it together. Flame cracker? Oh, I get it. Firecracker. It's a little confusing. Don't you guys watch commercials? The ones you don't understand, but they make you think? That's this! Abstract. I don't get abstract. Why didn't you just print the words, "The Firecracker"? 'Cause that's what the old sign said. We're startin' new here. Okay, we got a problem. What's this? Louie Downtown's cell phone. The one you were supposed to throw away? Yeah, but that's not the problem. That's how you get rid of a cell phone, Kevin! Guess I should have done that. You guess? Okay, Nicky Cottero made a bet with you on Louie's cell phone? Yeah, on that cell phone right there. That's what I'm tellin' you. And he lost? A thousand bucks. And he came to meet you last night to pay off the bet. Yeah. But he didn't pay you? No, he said he needed another day. That doesn't make any sense. He should have killed you. Yeah, I know. But I didn't think it'd be a good idea to press the issue. He's playin' games with us. Or he wants to make a deal with us. What kind of deal? I don't know, but if someone stole my business, I'd want to kill them. Unless I thought that they could make me money. Sean, get your car. Where we goin', Jimmy? You're not goin' anywhere. You screwed up enough. Where are you goin'? Nicky asked for another day, right? That's today. We're gonna go collect what's owed us. (SMOKE DETECTOR BEEPING) Dad? (COUGHING) Dad? (BEEPING STOPS) Dad! Hello? You open? No. Sorry, just lookin' for some breakfast. I smell bacon. How did you get in here? Door was open. (GUNSHO TS) (GRUNTING) JOEY. Now, Dokey had a dream, too. He wanted to be his brother Huey. Councilman Jack Trevor recently told Dokey how to achieve that dream. Unfortunately, things kept getting in the way. Councilman? I'm the chair of the buildings committee. I'm busy. Today, I get a call from this contractor down here. He's been getting grief from this overzealous inspector. So here I am, in the flesh, taking care of his problem. This inspector, next week, will be overzealous in Staten Island. Is there a problem, Jack? Bob Kelly, you know him? Yeah, I know him. Bob the Mouth. Bookie. He's a slob. Why? When I asked you to have no more bodies showin' up on the front pages of the city's newspapers, you misunderstood and thought it would be a good idea to have fat bookies flyin' out of 17-story windows. It can't happen. Jack, you talk to me like I'm some street punk again, and I'm gonna cut your tongue out. We had a deal. If I can't shake your hand and expect you to live up to it, then you gotta tell me now. I'll see what happened, and I'll look into it, okay? And you'll do it without anyone else getting killed, I hope. That's what we need. Derek Farrell, you know my chief of staff, Trish Hughes? Yes. Nice to see you again. I'll wait in the car. No, no, no. We're done here. Let's get out of here. Hey, we're closed. I'm just settin' up for the night. I'm lookin' for Nicky Cottero. He usually comes in later. Much later. What about that stooge he's always hanging out with? What's his name, Vinnie? Hey, listen, I don't know exactly what you're looking for, but whatever it is, do me a favor and look for it somewhere else. Hey, I told you not to come back here. Nicky is not here. Take another step, I'll chop your thumbs off! You do know that Nicky Cottero owns this bar, right? The last guy who didn't pay his bar tab got a meat hook up his ass. What do you think's gonna happen to you if you rob the place? What's the matter with this guy? I can't talk to him either. Tell Nicky that Jimmy Donnelly stopped by to pick up the thousand he owed. He wants to talk to me, he can call me at the Firecracker. Hit it! COP: I'll put the word out, but not much I can do officially. He's only missin' for what, two hours? I know something's wrong. Has he gone missing before? No, but he's been having some memory problems, and, I mean, just once in a while... So then he has done this before? He's never been missing before. Did he have any ID on him? Driver's license, ID bracelet? No, he left his wallet. I assume he's not registered? Registered? As an Alzheimer's patient? The Safe Return program, you know about it? He doesn't have Alzheimer's. How do you know that? You took him to a doctor? No, he wouldn't go. So you thought it'd be better to wait until he walked out the front door and got lost. Can I use your pen? I'm gonna give you my cell so if you hear anything you could call me. Hi, Vincent. Why don't you call me Vinnie like everybody else? I mean, why does it have to be Vincent? I like Vincent. Anybody can be a Vinnie. Yeah, well, I like being Vinnie. What's up? Guess I should let you boys talk. Oh, no, no, no. Stay here. Okay. Well, we got a response. From the Donnellys, right? Yeah. But it might not be the one you wanted. He robbed us for the $1,000 we owe him. Somebody robbed this bar and you're laughing? No, it's all right, baby. Nothin' I didn't expect. MUNST: Tommy! Coming! JOEY. Sometimes it's a little late to go for our dreams. It's then that you realize it's either give up the dream or come up with another. Kate came up with Tommy. Thought I'd see how your first day was going. Thank you for the job. Don't thank me yet. Munst is a slave driver. I see he's got you doing the easy work. I'm a mess. And that wonderful smell? That's me, too. No, you look good. I should let you get back to work. We have to set up a time for Matthew's next art lesson. Sure. Don't be too hard on him. Mmm. Good-lookin' widow. It's okay. Everybody needs a benefactor. In my day, I had more than one. (CHUCKLING) (TELEPHONE RINGING) Firecracker. Oh, okay. Sure, hold on. Jimmy, phone. It's him. Who is it? Nicky. Nicky? Nicky who? Nicky Cottero. Oh, Nicky Cottero! What's up? How can I help you? By the way, thanks for that thousand. I knew you'd be good for it. You know what this is about, right, Jimmy? Of course I do. You wanna talk, you wanna meet, you wanna be our friend, our partner. Our business associate, all of the above, right? Yeah, that's exactly right. Tell you what, put your brother Tommy on the phone. What? Put your brother Tommy on the phone, we'll meet, and then we'll put a deal in place. Let me tell you somethin', grease ball. You wanna meet with somebody, you meet with me. The Firecracker lounge, one hour. You can't miss it. There's a new sign outside. (TELEPHONE RINGING) MUNST: Hey, get that. Studio. Tommy. Kevin? You can't call me here, I'm working. No, no, Tommy, you listen. Nicky's comin' here to meet Jimmy. Whatever it is, you and Jimmy deal with it. Here. Thought you said you weren't gonna shoot anyone. We're not. This is just in case. Just in case what? Just in case Nicky so much as puts his hand in his pocket, I want you to blow his brains out. You know how this works? No, I never shot a gun before. There's, like, a safety, right? Like an on-off switch? This is a Walther PPK nine-millimeter with a slide-mounted safety. Here you go. Safety on, big trouble. Safety off, all problems solved. Then all you gotta do is point and shoot. Hey. When you're done with that, toilet's backed up. You done already? I'm not fixing your toilet. Ain't that tough a job, kid, it's just gonna need a good plunge. You're not havin' pride issues, are you? I didn't take this job to become a plumber. Ah. You ever seen the Sistine Chapel? Of course. In pictures. Uh-huh. Everybody has. Michelangelo's most famous piece. You know he didn't wanna paint it? He was a sculptor, he wasn't a painter. As far as he was concerned, next to sculpting, painting was crap. The only reason he did that was 'cause the Pope wanted it. When the Pope calls me, I'll clean his toilet. The point is, sometimes great work comes from dealing with crap. When you're done with the toilet, I need four dozen eggs. They should be in the fridge. Eggs? For the paint. What's the best moment of your life? Excuse me? The best moment of your life? Come on. When I was finally with the woman I loved. That sounds like cerulean blue to me. Making your own paint? I'm not gonna use that poster paint crap. Listen, you wanna learn how to mix paint? Get plungin'. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Studio. Kevin? Jimmy stole what? From Nicky? Kevin, I don't care. Jimmy's gonna do what Jimmy's gonna do. And if he gets himself killed, there's nothin' I can do about that. No, Kevin, I'm done. You sure it's locked? Yeah. Okay, good. Now we sit, we relax, we have a drink, and we wait. What? Nothin'. What, are you scared? No. Don't worry about these guys, though, Seanie. I put myself in a position where they need me. Why do you think Nicky called? You don't think he heard about what I've been doin'? Not just the bookmaking, everything. They want a piece of this neighborhood, they know they gotta come to me. Uh-oh. Has my dad been in today? Today? Yes, Kevin, today. Has my dad been in? No. I haven't seen him. Do me a favor. If he comes in, will you call me? Sure. Thanks. Yo, Jenny. Yeah? Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah, it's just... I'm sure it's nothing. Nice if you let us know who's coming through the door next time. I guess I screwed up again. What's up? I can't find my dad, that's all. He's been sick and... It's nothing. I don't need any help from you, Kevin. Why are you just standin' there? Because I don't know where to go! I've been everywhere! You try the Yoko Club? No. Where you goin'? With you. Look, with all due respect, I pay you for protection. Give me this. I shouldn't have to worry about some kids comin' in here and playin' Russian roulette with my face. You're right, and it's not gonna happen again, and you don't pay Jimmy Donnelly another dime. What about the other one? What are you not understandin' here, Christie? Fine. But... But what? Look, I don't wanna belabor a point, but Jimmy took 500 off me. Earl, give him $500. Look, I don't know if it matters to you, but the kid with Jimmy, I don't think he was a Donnelly. Seemed more like a crackhead to me. And Jimmy called the kid Whitey. JOEY. Now, for some people, losin' a dream can make you dangerous. 'Cause they don't think long-term. They just want what they want, when they want it. Earl, I want you to find out who this kid Whitey is and I want you to bring him to me. Fast. I don't think he's comin'. Shut up! (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yeah! Jimmy Donnelly. You're late! Yeah, well... (CHUCKLES) I already told ya, I don't wanna deal with the hothead junkie brother. I wanna deal with the smart brother. You don't talk to Tommy, you talk to me. Have Tommy give me a call. You do know how to deliver a message, don't ya? What happened? (BOTH LAUGHING) Come on, let's call him again. Hey, fellows. Get out, Kevin. You're barred until you square up. I'm not here to play. What'd you bring a girl in here for? We haven't had a girl in here in 50 years. I didn't think he had a girl. I have never seen a more asexual kid in my life. Three-to-one she's not his. Hey, have you guys seen lan Reilly? We're looking for him. Hasn't been in today. Thanks. Come on, Kevin. Hey, Joey. It's Jenny. Is he back yet? Not yet. But if he comes in, I'll give you a call. By the way, I love this place. And don't chisel me on the tip. I want you to give me that thing that Whitey gave ya. Why? Just give it to me. Jimmy, you know what we should do? We should just call Tommy. What? Why don't we just call Tommy? Why? Forget it. No! I wanna know why you think we should call Tommy. Jimmy, come on... You said that, right? We should call Tommy? I wanna know why you think that! I'm not gonna answer you. Then keep your mouth shut if you don't know what you're talkin' about. Jimmy... Okay, so I got news. Whitey is that fat-bookie- out-the-window's nephew. Nobody could ever figure out what jerk told Earl about Whitey. His name is Whitey. First name Terrence, last name Whalen. I don't know why Jimmy's hangin' around that guy. He's a low-life junkie. More coffee? Anything else you wanna know? I got customers. I want you to find him. And when you do, you ask him when was the last time he saw his uncle. 'Cause I'm thinkin' it was just before he took the swan dive, you know? All right. Here we go, set them down. Okay. Make a little pile, all right? Now, you do a little hole, like so. It's like a pie crust, you make a pie crust? Make a little hole in the flour. Here we go. Nice. We add a drop of honey. Now, here we go. All right. What's the worst moment in your life? Come on, you wanna be part of this or don't you? I hurt my brother. Okay. All right. That sounds like scarlet to me. You. Grind it. Go on. Harder. Ah, okay, that's good. That's good, that's good. Here we go. You got those eggs? All right, now, two yolks into this bowl. All right? Now just the yolk, little bit of membrane, all right? Not too much, the paint gets greasy. Nice. Honey. When I add the mix, it's gonna start to dry quick. You're gonna have to keep addin' water or I can't use it. Got it. Okay? You gotta go, okay. Are you ready to go? I got enough time to use the bathroom? Yeah, hurry up, hurry up. All right. You got five seconds before I get fired! Jimmy's on his way to kill Nicky. Really? I thought he was doin' that this afternoon. I'm goin'. Tommy, it's for real this time. He's goin' down to Nicky's bar, he's got a gun. Why? What happened? Nicky called the bar, said he wanted to make some kind of a deal. But he only wanted to talk to you. Look, Nicky made a jerk out of him, Tommy. He said he was comin', then made him wait at the bar for two hours. They laughed at him. JOEY. Now, Tommy had seen what Jimmy did to people who tried to make a jerk out of him. Give me your cell phone. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Beautiful, isn't she? Nicky, phone. A hundred dollars, who do you think that is? Tommy or Jimmy? Jimmy. You're gonna owe me a hundred. You look really good. Thanks. Why don't you go home? I'll see you back here tonight. Okay. All right. Bye, Vincent. Yeah. Yeah? Nicky Cottero? It's Tommy. Tommy Donnelly. If you wanna talk, I'm gonna be at Pete's, under the bridge. Twenty minutes. Don't be late. Go to the bar. What are you waitin' for? Okay. Tommy! All right. All right. All right, when I mix this, it's gonna start to dry, all right? It's gonna dry fast, so you gotta keep addin' the water or I can't use this paint. I gotta go. Pardon me? I'm sorry. You gotta add water to this or it's gonna dry out. Come on, whatever it is, it can wait. It can't. This came from you. You don't wanna see it? If you leave now, you're fired, you know that? Yeah, I know. But you're leavin'. Yeah. Do yourself a favor, kid. Give it up. 'Cause if there's somethin' else out there that's more important than this, it always will be. JOEY. Now, you might think this is the moment, the moment when Tommy walked away from his dream. But I'm not finished yet. We'll find him. Thanks. Thanks for coming with me today. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Yeah, this is Jenny Reilly. Okay. Okay, thank you. Who was that? That was the cop I spoke to earlier. We need to get a cab. A man my dad's age just got hit by a car. Does your father have any distinguishing marks? Scars, tattoos, anything like that? No, I don't think so. How old is he? My father is, um, 56. We have someone. You should make an identification. Identification, what does that mean? The cops said that you had someone that was hit by a car. That person expired a couple of minutes ago. He's been listed as a John Doe. I think it would be a good idea for you to make an identification. Oh, God. You need me to stay and pull the sheet back? I'll do it. You can take your time. Let's get out of here. It's not him. Your name Whitey? Who wants to know? Nobody asks "Who wants to know?" Unless it's them. Come on. The one guy who could have had his dream, and made it out of the neighborhood, Whitey. He was so fast, he could have made the Olympics or somethin' like that. But the idiot never went out for track. Where the hell have you been? Hey, Tommy. Thanks for comin'. No problem. How you doin'? Good. Want some wine? What's on your mind? You and I both know that your brothers killed Louie Downtown. They stole his business, which is my business. No, I don't know anything about that. It doesn't matter. It's all history. I wanna forget about the whole thing, we start from scratch. We start what? What do you think I'm talkin' about? Talkin' about business. Dokey Farrell's a dead man. The only thing left to do is bury him. What's that got to do with me? This. I could bury you and your brothers with Dokey, or we could talk about your future. Hey, guys! Sorry I'm late. So, what we talkin' about? You're gonna have to handle this. What I have to say is to you. Can you believe this guy, Tommy? Hey, did you order pizza yet or what? Jimmy, what are you doin'? I'm listenin'. I'm on the edge of my seat. Keep talkin'. Don't stop 'cause of me. What happened to this kid? Your mother dropped him on his head? Get your hands off me, Tommy! Come on, let's talk outside. You have somethin' to say, say it! This guy wants to make us a deal. And I need to hear it. It's not about you. It's about all of us. What makes him think you're the one he should be talkin' to? You really want me to tell you? Yeah. 'Cause he thinks I'm gonna get it done and you won't. That what you wanna hear, Jimmy? You know what, Tommy? Party's over. Please, don't do anything. He's gonna give me the gun. The hell I am! Jimmy, there's no choice here. Yeah, there is. He shoots me, I'm still gonna shoot him. Son of a bitch! (GRUNTING) Let him go. (CHOKING) Tell him to let him go. Tell him to let him go! Yeah. Outside. Your guy stays. All right. What's your offer? (BRAKES SQUEALING) (CAR REVVING) What are you, crazy? I could have run you over! Maybe you should have. So he give you a good deal? A very good deal. You get to keep Louie Downtown's action. Twenty percent of everything I got goin' on with Dokey. All of it. Extortion, prostitution, loan sharking, everything. What about Dokey? He's gonna kill Dokey. He's lookin' for somebody in the neighborhood he can work with. He thinks it's us. You mean you. It is a good deal. You took it, I hope. After all this? After all what? Let bygones be bygones. It's a great thing, it's what we always wanted. Now, Tommy knew Nicky was gonna get what he wanted. Dokey was gonna die. And if Nicky had his way, Jimmy, Sean and Kevin were gonna die, too. It was that simple. Did you take the deal? Tommy! Tommy, did you take the deal? I hope you weren't stupid about this. So what are we gonna do? Kill this kid and kill his brothers? What do you wanna do that for? You wanna ruin everything? What ruin everything? You told him that we're gonna kill Dokey. Don't you think he's gonna go tell him that? I think he likes Dokey less than we do. Why don't you have another glass of wine. Be a little patient. He'll come around. I guess I'll be goin', then. Thanks for lookin' after the place. It's nothin'. Joey. Yeah? Keys. Oh. JOEY. Actually, now that I think about it, no wonder I'm depressed. That was the day I lost my dream, too. Oh? I always wanted to be a short-order cook. So why didn't you ask her for a job? I never thought of that. Go home, Kevin. It's been a long day. I'll stay. It's beautiful, ain't it? It's pretty cool. Seanie, I been takin' care of ya, haven't I? Yeah. I believed in you, a little bit. Jimmy, I'm sorry I called Tommy. Nothin' to be sorry about. You think what you think. And it ain't much of me. I fired you. I know. I just wanted to see it. How it would look. JOEY. And that was the moment Tommy walked away from his dream. Hey, I'm feelin' much better now!
