These guys are my friends. Here's the deal, Joey. You tell us where the bodies are, how they got there, you stay in solitary, nice and safe. You lie, you go to general population where more people than I can count want to see you dead. Where are the bodies? There's two things that happened to Jimmy Donnelly that made him turn out the way he did. The first thing, do you know what a half-moon ride is? JOEY. It came around every summer. It was like an instant block party, and Jimmy had just stolen enough for us to get on. Now, the Donnelly brothers were always together. There was Kevin, Tommy, Jimmy and little Sean. And Jenny Reilly was, like, sewn to the hip. Even back then she drove poor Tommy crazy. Wait. I got the wrong year. It was the year I got my nickname, Joey Ice Cream. 'Cause under pressure, I'm like ice. Just give me some ice cream! But there's hardly any left. There's five gallons. (GRUNTS) Hey! (GRUNTING) Hey, that's mine! I stole that! Come on! Come back! No one even heard it coming. One of Jimmy's legs just shattered. He never grew much after that. And they never found the driver. (KIDS SHOUTING) Didn't seem to slow him down much, though. It's like he barely noticed. (BOYS SHOUTING) BOY: Lucky shot! DETECTIVE. You said it changed his life. JOEY. It did. Not in the way you'd think. Awesome. And not for a long time. I always wanted brothers like that. (GUNSHO TS) Okay, fast forward, here. (WHISTLING) It's 1999, I'm flush, I'm feeling good. Firecracker Lounge, please. You were in juvie in '99. It's 2002, I am flush, I am feeling good. You get one more chance. It's 2005 and I just spent the night with a woman who wouldn't stop. Here, take this. Gram, I don't need a raincoat. Oh, it folds up. Put it in your pocket. Firecracker Lounge. Go, go! Have you got your rubbers? See, all through history, people have accused the Black Irish of every crime that came along. They were supposed to have Gypsy blood, or Spanish or something, but my grandmother told me that before the Celts even showed up in Ireland, there was a race of dark-haired people who the Celts then proceeded to wipe out. But they could never get them all. A few of them ended up at the Firecracker Lounge. There was always something going on there. That day, it was a birthday party. No, it was a wake. JOEY: I'm going to miss you, Paddy. Have a raincoat. (IRISH MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Now, Jimmy won the bar in a crap game with Donny McCue a year before. It came with rotting floors and a gigantic tax lien. McCue swore he didn't lose on purpose. Now, Kevin had always thought of himself as a gambler. He always believed he was lucky. The fact that he'd never won a bet in his life somehow never dissuaded him of this notion. Really, Kevin? $2,000? How could you lose $2,000 on jai alai? You don't even know what jai alai is, do you? Why don't you show me. Show me how you play, Kevin. Tommy had a knack for two things. Drawing and getting his brothers out of trouble. What he didn't seem to understand is that he'd never go anywhere with the first if he couldn't let go of the second. Hold on. Which was the second? The bodies. Are you telling the story or am I? Sean was still the baby. Everybody loved Sean, especially women, which is why his brothers never let their girlfriends anywhere near him. Do you know how much Kevin owes? I don't know, 3,000? Oh, 3,000. Kevin! $3,000, Kevin? Now, a couple years before, Jenny, she married a schoolteacher. Now, Teach forgets to mention that he robs drug dealers to pay for his student loans. He goes into hiding, somebody stuffs him in an oil drum. Nobody had the heart to tell Jenny. I mean, even me, and we were like an item. Bug off, Joey. Yeah, you got it. She's a great girl, isn't she? Is Joey Ice Cream bothering you? No, no. He's just a little concerned that with my husband out of town, I might not be getting enough. And so he invited me to the bathroom for a couple minutes. Hey! Hey, Joey! Get back here! You know Kevin tried to borrow $4,000 from me today? Oh, 4,000. Okay. How's it going with Bonnie? Bonnie? The blond you introduced me to? What was she, a business student or something? Oh, it didn't work out. That's a real shame. FRANKIE: Hey, Jenny. Hey, Frankie. I'd pass on the ham. FRANKIE: Oh. You finally making your move? You and your friend are afraid to come in here without a badge? How's Jimmy? Jimmy's great. Yeah? Why? What's up? Well, somebody stole a truck this morning in the garment district. The detective who caught the case, he asked me about Jimmy. How could Jimmy steal a truck, Frankie? He can't even drive. That's what I told the man. You do with it what you want. I gotta get out of here. Hey, you got any naked models in that art school? 'Cause I want to visit. (CHUCKLING) Get out of here. Nice spread. Jimmy! Here you go. How you doing? How's Frankie? You robbing trucks? What are you talking about? Don't lie to me, Jimmy. Yeah, I'm going to lie to you. What are you, a cop? (BANGING) Hey, no banging on the machines! What? It took my money! JIMMY: It's supposed to take your money! You want to yell in my other ear? The Irish have always been victims of negative stereotyping. I mean, people think we're all drunks and brawlers, and sometimes it gets you so mad, all you want to do is get drunk and punch somebody. (MAN GROANING) He's going my way! What's this, the truck you didn't steal, Jimmy? Tommy, lighten up! Get out of the truck. The cop's here. Come on, you know Jimmy can't drive! Neither can you! Get out of the truck! Son of a bitch! Get back in the truck. Now I should get in the truck. Get back in the truck. Hey, Tommy, do you like this shirt? You're asking me if I like that shirt? Yeah. 'Cause I got a couple thousand more in the back. Tommy could drive anything. Before he became Mother Teresa, he had a big-time penchant for joyriding. Hey! Hey, do you wanna move? Now, Jimmy knew a guy who would take the shirts for 50 cents apiece. There was only one complication. Apparently, while we were in the bar, somebody stole the stolen shirts. TOMMY: So, anybody got any idea how to get $4,000? KEVIN: You hear what Bobby O and J.J. McGrane did? They stole an Italian. Held him for ransom. Where's Bobby O and J.J. Right now? I don't know. Attica, I think. Right. I'll see you later. Now, the bookie Kevin owed the money to was named Louie Downtown. Louie ran the book for Sal Minnetta. Sal and his right hand, Nicky Cottero, would drop by once a week just to keep Louie honest, but they weren't there right now. Since Kevin was short, he had to tell Louie that he needed more time. So Sean borrowed a friend's cab while the friend wasn't looking, and they took Jimmy along in case Louie didn't take the news too well. Did I tell you the second thing you had to know to understand Jimmy? Jimmy's father worked for the Steelworkers' union which was run by the Irish. Now, some Italians were trying to change that. Hey, Jimmy. Where's your father? He's in the coffee shop. Thanks. It wasn't his fault. He didn't know. But while he was listening to music, they were beating his father to death. He never saw their faces before or after, but he knew one thing. He knew they were Italian. And that's what Louie Downtown was. Italian. JOEY. For three months now, Tommy had been working up to asking out this photography student. Uh, <i>Blow-Up.</i> Your favorite movie? Yeah. Oh, my God! Me, too. You're kidding? Yeah! Well, I had a book... He might've had a shot if Huey Farrell hadn't shown up. Will you give me a minute? Yeah. Huey took over the neighborhood from Old Man Mulligan. The Irish had run it since the 1890s. Huey made sure it stayed that way. It's good. Look, Tommy, did you hear what happened to Louie Downtown? No. Some guys snatched him this morning. No kidding? Yeah. Three of them. Stuffed him in the trunk of a car and then drove off. Tell me your brothers spent the day at the tracks so I can go home happy. Huey, my brothers aren't that stupid. You know who Sal Minnetta is? Yeah, of course. Well, it turns out Louie Downtown is his nephew. Who knew, right? Keep working on the art stuff. Proud of you. Do you have a car? Yeah. Yeah? Where's Louie? Louie who? Stop lying! And keep an eye on her. Where's Kevin? I didn't take anything. How much did you steal? Nothing. Not a nickel. Yeah? Get out of here. You got it, champ. TOMMY: Hey! Oh, man. Hey, Kevin! Tommy, me and Jimmy went downtown with goodness in our hearts to work out a deal. But Louie starts threatening me. I mean, what was I supposed to do? Kevin, everybody knows who did this. You kidnap somebody, they're not supposed to know who you are. Tommy, you think we're stupid? We wore masks. You went own there with goodness in your hearts, but you wore masks. Get out of the way. (MUFFLED) Hey, get me out of here! Please, help me! Help me please! (LOUIE CONTINUES HOLLERING) What are you doing? I'm getting a knife. We're cutting him loose. Tommy, I love you, but I'd rather fight you than Jimmy. He's banged out of his head. Where is he? Hey! Hey, Sean! What the hell are you doing? You guys, like, seeing each other? 'Cause I didn't know! Go home! You go back to school! He's Sal Minnetta's nephew? Yeah. So he's worth a lot more. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Jimmy. We've got to give him back. What "we"? You walked away. He's not your Italian, he's our Italian. No, we got a thing, here, Jimmy. You've got to see that. You know what I see, Tommy? We got Louie Downtown. If we give him back now, are they going to thank us? No, they're going to think we're scared. Which means they're going to hunt us down and they're going to beat us to death. Is that what you want, Tommy? Hey, Tommy, you leave the door open? Did I leave the door open? Yeah, 'cause I went to get a beer, went right back down there. He wasn't there. Oh, hell! We got his shoes and his wallet. He's not going to catch a cab. Kevin, take a... Hey, kid. Where'd you get that shirt? Bug off! Jimmy! Louie. Kevin, that way! Split up! (GROANING) Hey, Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, Jimmy, come on! (BOTH GRUNTING) You, too, Tommy? What are you thinking? Listen to me. I'll talk to my uncle. You guys'll walk away with broken legs. And I'll throw in the five grand Kevin owes. Five grand? Five grand? Sal Minnetta did all his business out of the same booth every day and every night for 46 years. People say he had a toilet under the table. What kind of freakin' idiots live in this world? You don't kidnap a Louie Downtown. You ask, we give, no problem. (SIGHS) It's his nephew, Nicky. Do not make me laugh. You'll get me killed. (PHONE RINGING) Uh-huh? No, you listen to me, fella. He's my sister's son. You treat him well. How much? Thirty thou. Hey, it's family. The Donnelly brothers? You know them? You know their father. Bobby Donnelly. The guy was a Local 96 delegate. He was the father? What is this, some kind of vendetta? You know what I think it is? I think Huey Farrell is losing his grip on his neighborhood. I don't understand why we just don't go take it. It had long annoyed Nicky that the Irish had gotten away with ignoring the rules everyone else had to live by. In fact, just an hour before, he had a lively conversation with Mickey Hogan on the subject of using union carpenters rather than family and friends. (GROANING) We play this out till we get my nephew back. Nobody does anything till then. Sure, Sal. I'll pass the word. Stick. Hit. Busted. Damn. You owe me $900. Okay, once more through the deck. No, I'm not playing no more. No, no, no. I am down 900. Damn right, you're going to keep playing. You're not going to pay me, so why should I play? Are you calling me a welcher? So this is a real game and you're going to pay me? I'll pay you out of the ransom money. Fine, deal. Go ahead. Stick. Damn. No, I'm good, good. Thank you, yeah. You okay? Yeah. If you want something to eat, let me know. Okay. (SIGHS) Hey. Hey. I talked to my detective friend. They got a witness for this truck thing. They're going to put Jimmy in a lineup. Now, the thing is the witness said that Jimmy had a gun. This was armed robbery. And I think Kevin and Sean were with him. Why do you think that? There were three of them. It doesn't take a genius. Now, look, Tommy, your father was a good man and, because of that, I'm doing all I can here. But Jimmy's out of control. I think you should get him some help before he takes your other brothers down with him. All right, I appreciate it, Frankie. All right. Thanks. Take care, darling. Bye. (SIREN WAILING) What? Problems? No. Liar. When are you going to show me some of your drawings? You can put some up around here, you know, try and sell them. Yeah? You got a lot of art patrons coming in here? You'd be surprised. Bet I would. I might have to buy one myself, you know, as an investment, when you're famous. Yeah. Hey, be careful. Why? I don't know, just worry about yourself once in a while. Thanks. Hey. Jimmy, hey. Hey. We, uh, gotta talk. What time is it? It's 11:30. We have to be at the drop at 12:00. Just give me two seconds. We gotta talk first, Jimmy. Oh, give me a second, will you? Jimmy. Jimmy. Get out of here, Tommy. What are you doing? Ahhh! Hmm? Are you crazy? I had that needle in my arm! (GROANING) (GRUNTING) Get out! Get out. Get your money and get out of here. And you try to take Kevin or Sean with you and I'm gonna kill you. (CHUCKLING) You'll kill me? If you have that much pain, Jimmy, why don't you just jump off the roof? Hey, Sean. You're Sean Donnelly, right? It's all right. Go. Go! Where you going? TOMMY: Seanie! Sean! Seanie! Seanie! (TOMMY AND KEVIN SHOUTING) Call an ambulance! You saw what they did to Sean. You know what that would have done to Jimmy. All I can do is talk to Sal and try and make him see that. But I need your word Jimmy isn't planning anything else. You got my word. Tell your mother Sean's in my prayers. Yeah, I will. I got one dollar and this thing's got to take it. Sal had no right. I was giving Louie back. Nah, he had no right. You've got to get him, Tommy. You know that. You got him, Jimmy. I sure as hell did. What did you do with his body? You don't need to know. Did you get rid of the gun? As soon as I'm finished with it. If you get caught with that, you might as well confess. How come there's never anything you want? You got three or four more guns in the bar alone. Don't be stupid. Let me get rid of it. (SIREN WAILING) You know I got to do this, right? You know that, no matter what you say, I gotta make this right. You ask me to say I won't, I'll just lie. I did that to him, Tommy. I did it again. Thanks, Nicky. What about his brothers? Is that a problem? Jimmy's the only problem. He's a punk and a doper. He'd be more comfort to his mother dead than alive. Tommy's a smart boy. When Jimmy's gone, he'll be able to say he did what he could. As long as it's only Jimmy, because anything other than that, it'll be me with the problem. HUEY: I got it. You hear Mickey Hogan's at Saint Margaret's? No kidding? Someone busted up his bar. Beggars are our business. Must be nice having a right hand like Nicky. You can retire anytime and know your business is in good hands. I'll see you around, Sal. Hey. Thank you for coming. Where's your mother? She's in the waiting room just waiting to hear from the doctor. I brought some food from the restaurant, so I'll go... Good. Maybe if we get some more, we can open up a deli. You know, when I heard about it, the person who told me thought it was you. I thought, what if he dies and he never knows that I loved him? Dumb, huh? I mean, I'm a married woman. Nothing's ever gonna happen. I just... I just couldn't stand the idea of you dying and not knowing that. Hey, Tommy. Hey, Huey. How you doing, Jenny? Hi. Going in there? Give that to Helen for me, from my wife. Sure. Okay. I'll be with your mother. Let's go get a coffee. Well... It's gonna be painful, but it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay? What, you talked to Sal? When I walked in the room, he wanted you all dead. But I had something to trade. You don't need to know what. He wants his money back and he wants Jimmy to apologize to him tonight, in person. Can you get your brother to do that? To apologize? Jimmy'll have to be willing to take a beating. I'm not going to lie to you. Not as bad as Sean. But you get your brother to go down to Sal's tonight by himself. He walks in there with you guys or a weapon, he's going to get killed. You get him to take his beating, everything will be okay. Okay? It was at that moment... Hey, I can't thank you enough, Huey. It was at that moment that Tommy knew that Jimmy was dead. You all right? Yeah. Jimmy was the price they were gonna pay. Huey had sold them out. You like that shirt? Yeah. You want one? Nah, I'm good. Don't worry about it. Jimmy. Hey, Francis. How you doing tonight? Good. How are you? Oh, same old, same old. Detective Calero, I want you to take note that the suspect is turning himself in voluntarily. Yeah, I see that very clearly. Not for nothing, but what am I turning myself in for? Jimmy, you boost a truckload of shirts, you get seen. That's unlucky. You walk around all day wearing the evidence, I can't feel too sorry for you. So, this is for the truck thing? You got something else you want to confess to? No, I'm good. All right. How'd you know where I was? Jimmy, your little brother's up there. Where else you gonna be? It's raining again. Jimmy got pinched for the truck thing. But he just went down to get some beers. Yeah. That sucks. I talked to Frankie. He said he'd get him into rehab. So you talked to Frankie? I talked to Frankie. Huh. So, it's not a bad thing? No, it's not. I'm gonna step out for a minute. Sure. Where you going? Wherever you are. Hey. I'm making you a sandwich. Well, save it for me. Tommy, listen to me. You are not your brother. Stay and eat your sandwich. Please. I'll be back for it. (SIGHING) Yeah? It's Tommy Donnelly. Says he needs a word. Tommy Donnelly wants to talk to me. Send him down. Downstairs. JOEY. You remember I told you about the day that changed Jimmy's life? I was the only one who saw him, the only one who knew that it was Tommy driving the car. To this day, it's the one thing I never told anybody. I'm ashamed to be telling you now. Tommy never stole a car again, never did nothing, turned his whole life around. I mean, he could have made it out, only he was never going to let his brother be hurt again. And this was the day that changed Jimmy's life forever. 'Cause Jimmy went to rehab, and Tommy... Tommy became everything he never wanted. And whether he realized it or not, with Huey dead, Tommy had just taken over the neighborhood. And he was going to have to defend it. And that's where we left the bodies, right where they lay. And what the Italians did with them... I mean, I can't say.
