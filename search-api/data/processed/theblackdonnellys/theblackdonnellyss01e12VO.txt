I know you remember Jenny Reilly, but do you remember she was a married woman? Your husband was a louse. Since her husband robbed drug dealers, when he disappeared, nobody went looking. JENNY: Bug off, Joey. Yeah, you got it! Tommy Donnelly's been looking for who's been condemning all the buildings in the neighborhood. Especially Reilly's Diner. Don't let them take my diner. But everything's a dead end. KEVIN: Lambert's office was here yesterday, right? See, nobody wanted Tommy asking questions. Especially Dokey. You remember Tommy and Dokey were partners now. So Dokey gave Tommy a little friendly advice. You ask too many questions. You wanna die like your father? Helen told the same story, with illustrations. But Tommy wouldn't leave it alone. He had to know who killed his father. Who did it? (GRUNTS) Some answers are better left unquestioned. I got stabbed! Stabbed! I'm in protective custody. What kind of protection is that? Oh, my God, I hate blood. Don't be such a baby. "Baby"? Let's see how brave you are when it's your blood! I wanna be clear on one thing. I could have taken him. But he caught me in the shower! I mean, who can fight naked? I'm gonna stitch you up now. Could you put me to sleep first? 'Cause, uh, I think that might help. Talk to me. Tell me a story. Nobody has ever asked me that before. It will take your mind off what I'm doing. Okay. My friends had a contract out on me. They weren't always like that. It's something Tommy Donnelly had to learn. Joey, what are you doing? I'm listening. To what? Nothing, I'm on hold. Trust me, I'm gonna get this. (FLOOR CREAKS) Ah! Damn it! Why does it give you so much pleasure to do that? It's the oldest bit in the world. It's a good bit, I like the bit. So what's the big plan? We're going after Lino. Lino? That guy that condemned Reilly's diner? Yeah. Tommy, there's more to life than Reilly's Diner. For instance, I wanna know more about these corporations. Now, if Dokey's making all this money, maybe we can get some of it. JOEY. Actually, Tommy was way past helping Reilly. He was this close to finding out who killed his father. But he couldn't tell Jimmy that. Because Jimmy's way of finding out things often kept you from finding anything out. You don't wanna help, Jimmy, that's okay. Good. 'Cause I don't wanna help. I'll be at the Firecracker. Good thing, anyways, 'cause me and Mr. Reilly are going through a rough patch right now. Great news. I know where this Lino is. Are you gonna tell us? Or are you just gonna keep smiling like an idiot? No, I'm... I'm gonna tell you. I... Oh, wait. I just forgot. No, I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding! Ow! (MUFFLED) Come on! Get off of me! I don't know why we're doing this. It's everything I learned in high school. What about the stuff everybody else learned after you dropped out? We're going to spend $23 on a book I don't even need. $23.90. What does GED stand for, anyway? General Equivalency Diploma. That's got a nice ring to it, huh? They have everything in here, right? All the information, the subjects, what you need to study, where you take the test? All the information, the particulars? I can find that out for myself, Mom. It's in the book, Seanie, that's why we're buying it. Right? What? All the information is in here? Oh, I don't know. That's why he's working in a bookstore, Seanie. You want that to happen to you? Thank you. Hey, how's it going? You sleep good? Yeah. So, Jen. Yeah? Dad? Huh? You were gonna say something? About what? I don't know. You... You were gonna ask me something. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, right, uh... Uh, forget it. Get to work. Hey, Frankie! Coffee? Nah, not today, thanks. Hey, Jenny? Everything okay? Yeah, well, maybe not. You might say I got bad news. Yeah? What's going on, Frankie? All of a sudden you're sounding like a cop. I don't like that. Dad! Jenny, we found a body. Body? And we think it might be your husband. Teach? (GUNSHO TS) Jenny had heard the rumors that some drug dealers had killed Teach and stuffed him in an oil drum. But who wants to believe in a rumor? FRANKIE: The remains were unidentifiable. It was a male in his mid-twenties. These belongings were found on what was left of his body. "T.C." is on the money clip. That could be for "Tommy Corcoran." Teach have a money clip like this? Yeah, he had a money clip, I don't remember the initials, though. I don't... Can she take it out of the bag? Uh-uh. No. What would be good is if you could tell us if these other possessions were his. Uh... You can pick them up if it helps. Yeah, I... I guess that could be his belt. Take your time. Really look at these pieces. (WHISPERING) I don't know. I don't know. Is that his? It's hard to tell. It's not like we went to Tiffany's, you know? A lot of people could have that ring. Yeah. And it doesn't match yours. Oh, we didn't have matching bands. I used my mom's. All right. Well, we can call this inconclusive. All right. I'll check our dental records. What would be better, is if you had something we could use for a DNA comparison. We threw all his crap out. I'll look around. Thanks. And you, you're getting a little too cranky for your own good. I'm okay, Dad. I didn't say you weren't. I don't feel bad. I don't feel anything. Okay, now I feel bad. JOEY. Anthony Lino. Chief Engineer, Buildings Department. He made big money by writing up small violations. Lots of them. You got a huge crack in the sidewalk out there. Where's Janowski? In the back. JOEY. Actually, Janowski was tied up underneath the counter. Which is why Tommy was able to throw on a smock and show Lino all the violations in the back alley. It's a little dark back here. Ah, that's a violation, too, you know. You gotta have brightly lit halls. Where is he? (GRUNTS) Hey! What the hell's going on? Hey, Doke! How are you, partner? I gotta remember to lock my doors. Not really. Who'd be stupid enough to get in a car with you? What do you want, Jimmy? Listen, I been thinking. You got a minute? Sure. The way I hear it, things are going a lot better on your end than what me and my brothers thought. So this 30% deal that you made with my brother Tommy... I'm thinking that was a bonehead play. I'm thinking we can do better. That's an awful lot of thinking. Is this you and your brother doing all this thinking? Let's face it, Dokey. 70% on four blocks is a pretty bad deal. I say we renegotiate. Oh, we're gonna renegotiate something we just negotiated a couple days ago? Like I said, my brother screwed up. I'm just trying to fix things. Man, you got a big set of balls on you, you know that? If there's one thing people know about me, it's I can be trusted. Ask anybody. We shake hands on a deal, the deal's done. I'm just asking for a bigger piece of the pie. We're willing to work for it. You really wanna work for it? Okay. Okay what? Okay, I got a job for you. I got a package that... You got a problem with drugs? No. Good. You go down to Jimmy Ray's, you ask for Paddy, you tell him I sent you, you get a package, you deliver the package. That's the job. I do this and then what? You do this, and then we'll talk about renegotiating. You're dead. I get out of this chair, I'll knock you runts ass over teakettle. What the hell is this all about? You're here because you've been condemning a lot of buildings for your friends. One building in particular, Reilly's Diner? You're gonna reverse that. You dumbbells have any idea what you've gotten yourself into? (GRUNTS) (COUGHING) We know who you are. We know what you do. Now tell us how to reverse what you did to Reilly. Okay, say I take you seriously for a second. Good decision. But what you want, it can't be done. It's through the pipe now! No, no, come on. (SCREAMING) No, no! Come on, stop! All right! Stop! Come on! All right! Tell him to stop! Tell him to stop! Kevin. All right! Ow! Burnt hair stinks. (GASPS) Whoa, look at that. It's like a happy face, Tommy. Cool. Let's do it again. No! No, don't do it again! Don't do it again! Okay! Okay, okay. It can be done, but it's crazy difficult. You have to go to the Buildings Department, fill out a request for reappraisal. Then you gotta get an inspector to reevaluate, one of my guys, then that paperwork comes back to me, I gotta sign, then my office has to reissue. Gonna take a minimum, minimum, six to nine weeks. Great. We need it done today. It can't be done. Uptown, downtown, the Russians and the Irish. Plus, I got a nice surprise for you. Surprise? And you say I never take the initiative! If I wanted you to do prep work, I would have asked you. What? We haven't changed our minds on this Alo thing, have we? Absolutely not. We're not gonna need this. We could drown him in his pool. I'd rather drown you in his pool. Could you explain to me please why that's such a bad idea? What's important here? To kill Alo before he kills us. And after that? Bury the body. Which is why I prepped the trunk! You missed a step. Right! Nobody can know that we did it because then we'd get whacked. Bingo. So now what's the plan? The only thing I know for sure is that I do not want Alo in my trunk. I don't feel so good. Get up. Where you been? I missed you. Yeah, right. Come on. Let's go. I'll take care of you. Come on! I'm in a hurry! Gotta go, gotta go! Hey! Hey. Is Ma here? I wanted her to meet Nadine. How about me meeting Nadine? I'm Jimmy, Sean's brother. Actually, we met. I sold you a jukebox. Oh, you're the jukebox girl! Nadine. What, you guys are hanging out now? Seanie, are those books? You're a bad influence on my brother! She's gonna tutor me. In what, though? That's the question, huh? (JIMMY LAUGHING) What the hell is so funny? Oh, hey. Sorry, I didn't know anyone was here. Jeez, Joanie! Seanie, I'm sorry. Come on, we're leaving. What do you mean, leaving? I didn't even say hello yet. Hi, Seanie! Hey, Joanie. Hi! Nice to meet you, Joanie. We should get going, come back later when Ma's here? Sure. It was nice meeting you again. Come on. You're going home. What... You're coming with me, right? No. I want you to take a shower. Clean your pits, put some makeup on. Why? Just get it together and meet me at the Firecracker later. Are you mad at me? Joanie, I got something good going. And I want you to be with me. But you gotta stop acting like a crack whore. You talk to anyone? I haven't gotten up there yet. You don't have to wait in line. Just go up there and show them Lino's business card like he told us to do. No. I'm not cutting the line, Tommy. I hate people who cut the line. Give me the card. People aren't gonna like it, that's all I'm saying. What an ass! Now, what's this? The line's back there, buddy. Anthony Lino asked me to give that to you. Just a second. I don't have a second. You're gonna have to. (PHONE RINGING) I'm not so good with this rough stuff, so don't make me nervous. MAN. Tony? Hello? This is a two-week turnaround. No, now. It's gotta be done in one hour, no longer. All the people I got waiting, one hour? Today? Yeah, today! Just do what I'm telling you! As I understand it, a buildings inspector will be there for a reappraisal? That's correct. John Fergus. He'll be at the diner at noon. Give him this. Hey, how you doing? Is Paddy here? Someone here to see you. What's up? Jimmy Donnelly. Dokey sent me. Nah, he didn't tell me he was sending somebody new. Who said I was new? Oh, hey, take it easy. We left the war over there with the Arabs. Look, can we just get this done? You got a package for me, right? Yeah, but it's gonna be a bit. I'll buy you a drink. Leo, couple of Irish whiskeys. Nothing for me. Leo, say hello to Jimmy Donnelly. He's with Dokey. Hey, Jimmy, nice to meet you. Hey. You sure? It's gonna be 20 minutes, half hour. All right. No problem. On the house, Jimmy! JOEY. Funny thing about Teach's scarf is that it didn't start out as his scarf. It's not too pretty, is it? No, I can work with this. Okay, then. Happy birthday! It's a great scarf. Good night. Get out! I'll see you tomorrow. Yup. JOEY. It was the best birthday Tommy Donnelly ever had. It lasted for all of 17 and a half seconds. Hey. I'm freezing my ass off out here. Yeah. So I'm gonna get right to the point. Stay away from my daughter. Excuse me? Stay away. And not a word to Jenny about this conversation. Why? Because I don't like you. With all due respect, sir, you can't tell me what to do. Here. What's that? Your payoff. You're just like your old man, so I figure you'll take it. I paid your father so his animals wouldn't bust up my diner. Now I'm paying you to stay away from my daughter. My father wouldn't do anything like that. Okay? You think that? Think it. But I got the scars to prove that I'm right. And I'm gonna show them to my Jenny. Who do you think she's gonna believe, you or me? She's gonna hate you. I'll make sure of that. Why are you doing this? Because you're his blood. You're the same as he was. Reilly was threatening to make Jenny hate Tommy the way Reilly hated Tommy's father. And Tommy would never admit it to anyone but he knew Reilly could do it. So this, uh, "boyfriend" thing ends now! They said this wall was damaged. Does it look damaged to you? Nope. No, it doesn't. Looks solid as a rock. The whole building could have been put up last week. I've been thinking. It's probably better if you leave some things to me. What things? Like the way I did with Franny. You don't know where I put him and that's a good thing. This way if anything happens down the line, you can honestly say you don't know. Kevin... I'm figuring we should do the same thing with Lino. Let's just get what we need out of Lino. And worry about the rest later. We can't keep him in the cellar forever. These sons of bitches condemn my building without even inspecting it. Now they tell me it's okay without inspecting it. How do you people live with yourselves? Buddy, take it easy with the insults. Well, hallelujah, the bastard looked up from his clipboard. Mr. Reilly, do you want me to take care of this? You should go have a cup of coffee. Okay, I submit the papers today, you got a six-week turnaround. Six weeks doesn't work. We need to get it through today. (LAUGHING) What, are you all crazy in here? Something like this, you gotta go through the proper channels. Anthony Lino said you could get it done today. Yeah, well, Lino lied. Take it up with him. Tommy, should I take care of this? No, I got it, Kevin. How much? (CHUCKLING) What, to get it done today? Yeah. (CHUCKLING) That's a tall order. Okay. It's my kid's birthday. He wants a BMW. A BMW? A $60,000 car? That's why I can't buy it for him. You asked me for the impossible, I'm asking you for the impossible. JOEY. The stupidest people in the world are rich people. They'll hand over 20 bucks and a brand new BMW to any idiot with a windbreaker and a tucked-in shirt. In this case, the idiots were Kevin and Tommy. (TIRES SQUEALING) That was gonna take six weeks? My end's done. Rest is up to Lino. We'll be back. Who wrote the <i>Federalist Papers?</i> That color looks good on you. (CHUCKLING) Shut up and answer the question. I know this. I'll just put it on the test when the time comes. All right, um, there were 85. Mmm. Alexander Hamilton wrote 52, James Madison wrote 28, John Jay wrote five. And who was John Jay? I have no idea. Who the hell are you? Ma, I want you to meet somebody. Hi. Uh, Nadine, this is my mom. Mrs. Donnelly, it's nice to meet you. What's all the charade about? I'm studying for the GED. Nadine's helping me. Yeah, I'll bet she is. I should go. No. Stay. You know what, Ma? You're embarrassing me. What? Nadine's a nice girl. You're treating her like she's not. She's the reason I went back to school... Sean. Obviously there's something going on here that I don't know about. The last thing I want is to come between you and your mom, so I'm gonna go. Mrs. Donnelly, it was nice to meet you. I hope the next time we see each other it's under better circumstances. I'm sorry. Hey! Yes? Where you going? Sit down. I'm making pork chops. You like pork chops, don't you? How'd it go? Frankie said he's gonna make it happen quick, you know? I brought him Teach's travel kit, a razor, brush, some other stuff. It's good that we put this damn thing behind us. I don't know why the hell you ever married that guy to begin with. Dad. What? I'm wrong? (CHUCKLING) Oh, my God, I can't believe you almost just made me laugh. JOEY. Remember that scarf that started out as Tommy's birthday present? That's the thing about birthday presents. Half the time you end up taking them back. What, you didn't like it? It's not that. What then? It just wouldn't be right to take it. Why not? I met somebody a while back, Jenny. What? I should have told you about her. A girl from school. It just wouldn't be right. You know what I mean? It's just a scarf. Don't make a big deal out of it. Hey, look. If you care that much about the guy, maybe we'll get lucky and it won't be him. No. I'm fine. I'm off tomorrow. We can go to that movie. Movie? Wow, you must feel really sorry for me if you're willing to go see a movie. My dad is gonna lend me the car. Dad, what are you talking about? Now, come on, Meredith, don't make a fool of me now. I told everybody you and me were going to a movie. Okay, we can go to the movie if you want. What? You a little tired, Dad? Little bit. Look... All I wanna say is this. Very soon we're gonna know if that rat bastard husband of yours is gonna be out of our lives once and for all. And, uh, we'll... We'll deal with it then. Okay. I, uh... I need to take a nap. Call me if it gets busy. (ALL LAUGHING) JIMMY: Well, call me crazy, but I like a bony ass! PADDY: Oh, yeah? A bony ass is just happy to be with somebody! SHARKEY: Me, I like the double bubble! Now, there you go! That's the one! The problem with the double bubble, is you gotta chase down every jackass on the street trying to hone in on you! The other problem is, I'm one of them! (ALL LAUGHING) Are you guys having fun? Hey, Dokey! My man Dokey! Yeah, I got that package for you. But it's not here yet. (LAUGHING) Don't worry about the package, it's screwed up at the other end anyway. We're doing shooters. You want a shooter? Too early for me. Wanna have a little fun? Who wants to shave their head? Yeah! Yeah. No, I'm serious! Yeah? Let's do it! Me! I'll go! I'll go! Let me go! Let me go! I wanna go! Jimmy! I'm first! Me first! Me first! You're first? Jimmy! Jimmy! What the hell, right? Come on! Yeah! Yeah! (ALL CHEERING) ALL: Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! (HOOTING) ALL: Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Sign. It's red. So? You can't sign an official document in red? Uh, I could, but, uh, do you really wanna shine a light on this? These things are usually filled out in black. I got a pen in my pocket. Now sign it and quit talking down to us. Can I talk to you for a minute, please? After you sign it. (SIGHS) All right. Take this back to where you were this morning and you're good to go. Now, undo me? Tie him back up. What do you mean, "tie him back up"? This is where I come in, now, Tommy, 'cause I got a place and everything. Not yet, Kevin. Oh, what are you talking about? Come on! I'm tired! My wrists hurt! I gave you a miracle today, now you're talking like idiots! You shut up, all right? You got no say in this! Kevin. What? Tommy' he's really starting to bug me. You and Joey get this thing pushed through. Make sure it looks legit. Then we'll talk about him. Just do it, and meet me back here. There's something wrong with that kid. At least you, you got a head on your shoulders. Now cut me loose, will you? You wanna walk out of here? That would be nice. Yes. Who do you work for? The City of New York. (SIGHS) Al Onataro. Who else? (STAMMERING) I don't know who else, honest to God. I take my orders from Alo. How long have you worked for Alo? I don't know, eight, ten years maybe. You ever know a guy named Bobby Donnelly? What? Bobby Donnelly. Did you know him? I knew of him. He was a hard-headed mick. What? Oh! What else you know about him? Nothing! Hmm? Some Italians walked into a diner nine years ago and beat him to death. I wanna know who they were. I don't know. Hmm? I don't know. I don't know! I don't! I swear on my kids I don't know! These guys have been killing guys like Bobby Donnelly for years! I'm just a half-assed gopher, I'm not involved in that end of things! I don't know anything about it! (SIGHS) Talk to me about Longdale Properties. I wanna know everything they bought in this neighborhood, why they bought it and who's a part of it. You don't know what you're doing. You're not just taking on Alo or Dokey, you are taking on City Hall, and I don't even know how deep it goes. Come on, untie me. If that's true, then they're just gonna undo everything I did today, is that what you're telling me? No. I'll protect you on this diner thing. I'll tell them it came from the bureaucrats. They'll leave it be. But I know you and that other nitwit think it's a smart play to kill me. Believe me, if you do, you're killing yourself, too. Can I help you? You wanted to make a deal with me. That tells me you and Alo aren't getting along so well. Actually, I think you hate him as much as I hate Dokey. You know, if you're trying to impress me, stating the obvious doesn't usually get it done. What if I got something you want? Well then I'd ask you to take a seat. Anthony Lino's tied up in my basement. Hey, Mia? Yeah. Let me get two beers. Okay. So? Lino's been condemning buildings all over my neighborhood. Dokey and Alo are buying them up. Okay. Lino's the heart of whatever Alo's plans for the future are. I'm betting you're not a part of them. So, you having a talk with Lino, that would be a good thing. Here you go. Something to eat, Nicky? No. So Lino's the something you want. What I want is to know who killed my father. What makes you think I could tell you that? Okay. I'll tell Lino goodbye for you. Hey, hey, hey! What's wrong with you Irish? You're like all a bunch of hotheads. Sit down. What did he want? Only good things. Lino thought he was going home to his family. I just want you to know, my word is good. I'll make sure everything stays right. I'll take care of the bureaucrats. Hey, come on. JOEY. If Tommy was gonna do what his father couldn't and save the neighborhood from the mobsters, he was also gonna have to do things his father wasn't willing to do. Hey. The day your father was murdered, Huey called your mom. And she got your dad to meet Sal over this real estate thing. I knew that. I want to know who did the kicking. You know what, guys? This is wrong. You do what you want, but I'm done here. JOEY. Huey saw it coming. Which is why he was there. And why he brought Dokey... (EXCLAIMS) (GROANING) ... who made his bones that day. (TIRES SQUEALING) Go, go, go! (LAUGHING) Jimmy? Jimmy? What happened? Where are your clothes? Dokey motor oiled my ass! I'm road kill! It's pretty hilarious, huh? Let's go. Come on. JOEY. That day killed me. See, Jimmy and me, we had a special bond. I'm a joke! Dokey got me good! Dokey got me good! Dokey did this to you? Get me inside. Jenny. We, uh, won't be needing any of this, the dental records came back. I'm sorry, it's Teach. You okay? Yeah. Is the grouch around? He's upstairs. You want me to stay for a bit... No. Uh, thanks, for coming and telling me in person, you know? Well, the, uh, good news is now you know that he didn't leave you. JOEY. If it wasn't for that damn scarf, Jenny might not have been alone that night. And neither would Tommy. I'm not gonna stop seeing Jenny. As a friend or as a boyfriend. When I'm done talking with her, it won't be either. You won't have to tell her. I'll do it myself. Just know this, you didn't know my father. And you sure as hell don't know me. JOEY. That was one of Tommy's proudest moments. Going to Reilly to fight for Jenny. What he didn't realize was there was nothing left to fight for. Hey! Where the hell you been? We gotta celebrate! Tommy! I just won this bar in a poker game! JOEY. The thing about blood, family, it's always there. You can hate each other, you can wanna kill each other, but you never stop loving each other. But "love" love? Damn. And that's a whole other thing. It's okay. It's okay. Shh. You're okay. Shh. I'm coming with you. (ALL CHATTERING) (WOMAN SCREAMS) Everybody freeze! DOCTOR. Two guns, Joey? You said you weren't comfortable with blood and violence. But you had two guns. Okay, I had one gun. But I told you about my feelings for Jimmy. So I was steady. Like an oak tree or something. Like I had never been before. Everybody freeze! (SHOUTING AND SCREAMING) Back off, man, back off! Back off! (GASPING) Just know this, you didn't know my father. And you sure as hell don't know me. Tommy... No, put it away! You better kill me. Shut up! Tommy. He's right, we gotta kill him! Kill me! There's too many people around. You're dead!
