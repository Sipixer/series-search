Damn. But as luck would have it, after killing him, Jimmy found Louie's cell phone with his whole bookmaking business on it. Then they found Whitey, who knew how to run the book, which left Kevin and Jimmy to collect the winnings. Did I mention that Jenny Reilly's dad's been forgetting things? Like the difference between a bank and a mailbox? Now their mortgage payments are gone. Okay. Skip to the Italian mob boss, Alo. He wants peace with the Irish. But Nicky Cottero? He hates Irishmen, so he killed a couple. That was a mistake. At this point, Sean Donnelly hates the idea of going back to school, but his mom thinks school will keep him out of trouble. Hey! Good luck with that. And Dokey? He's much more interested in the future, and in particular his nephew. That little guy's mom, Kate Farrell, has got a different future in mind. Too bad Tommy's still stuck on Jenny. McCARTHY: Tell us about Robert Kelly. Who? Bob the Mouth. Never heard of him. But I gotta tell you, you gotta feel for a guy unlucky enough to get tagged with a name like that. You want to know what unlucky is? How a guy can fall off his chair, like the one you're sitting in and break his neck. You know, I suddenly remember the fellow you're talking about. JOEY. We met him around the time Jimmy decided to paint the Firecracker. How we gonna pay for all this? What's up, guys? How we doing? JIMMY: Doing real good, Mel. Don't worry about ringing this up. What do you mean? I mean, we're good. Jimmy, don't do this. Look, I am paying that bum Dokey $200 a week so this kind of thing doesn't happen. JOEY. Talk about luck. If Jimmy doesn't decide to paint the bar that day, maybe Mel never mentions Dokey extorting 200 a week from him. And maybe we never get into a whole new business. You're paying Dokey $200 a week? Yeah. So that Dokey doesn't do to me what you're doing! Here's the deal, Mel. How much you think all this stuff costs? I don't know. Three hundred, maybe. Box it up for me, and I don't come back for my hundred for another three weeks. What, your hundred? It's half what Dokey's getting, and he's never even around. At least I'll be around to help you with things like this. Jimmy, please... Let's not belabor the point here, Mel. The price could go up. JOEY. Actually it's a lucky thing we stumbled into the extortion business, because the bookmaking business was about to hit a bump. McCARTHY. Stop right there! What does any of this have to do with Kelly? Bob the Mouth. Yeah. Oh, well, all that started with Kevin. Kevin? Kevin Donnelly? Yes, Kevin Donnelly. Who we talking about here? Newton. Where are you? You're making me look bad in front of my partners, Newton. I'm waiting on the corner, show up or call me. Son of a bitch still isn't there! It's not good, Kev. This guy owes us 10 grand, man, where do you get off giving out a ten-grand bust out? He'll show. I know the guy. Call him again. You're a real hump, you know that? I'm a hump. You know who's a hump? My Uncle Bob's a hump because we laid off Newton's ten-grand bet with him, and if he doesn't get paid, one of us is gonna die. JENNY: He's been forgetting things, losing things. I can't get him to go see a doctor. Why not? He says there's nothing wrong with him. He doesn't even want to talk about it. I think he's scared. Hey. I just found out that we are seven months behind in the mortgage. We're gonna lose the diner, we're probably gonna lose the whole building. Can't you re-finance, something like that? Yeah, we've already done that too many times. He's going to sell half to Dokey. Dokey? Dad went to him for a loan and Dokey said he wouldn't give it to him unless he made him a partner. So they're gonna sign the papers tomorrow. No, don't let him do that. You know Dokey. If he gets half of it, he'll rob the rest. How much money you need? $13,000. $13,000? Forget it. I'm sorry, I don't know what I was thinking. No, it's okay. $13,000 is a lot of money. If I can get it, you might not like how I do it. (SIGHS) This diner is all he has. I can't let him lose it. (GUNSHO TS) MICHAEL: You want to borrow $13,000? By tonight. Ain't you an art student? Yeah. You make a lot of money studying art? My wife is wondering why we should loan you this money. You gotta admit it's a fair question. I know you a long time, Michael. Anybody ever say I was somebody that you couldn't trust? No, you got a great rep. Then what's the problem? Talk to your brother Kevin. Let's go, I'm hungry. Whoa, whoa, what? Kevin owes you money? MICHAEL: Two grand. You want to know why I never went after him? 'Cause then me and my brothers go after you. I don't loan money to nobody I can't beat up! And I told you this can't happen, Jimmy. Jimmy, I'm gonna get the money! Joey, is that paint or prime? ...thing with my Uncle Bob. Use the prime. Will you shut up a minute please and let me talk? The white stuff's the prime. You put it on first. That's like painting it twice. Only customers we know. Why we gotta do that? That was the rule, Jimmy. Only customers we know. Whitey, would you shut up? Can't you see I'm trying to do something here? Joey, stop with the paint! What are you hollering at me for? I'm the one doing all the work. How much do we owe Bob? Same as Newton, $10,000. What about the rest of the week's collections? About $5,000. It doesn't help us with Bob. Kevin, do you know this Newton or don't you? Course I know him. You gonna collect his money? Yes! By noon? 'Cause that's when Bob expects his money. Hey, he said he'd get the money. Jimmy, can I have a minute with you? You asked me to go to my uncle and I did. And I promised him that whatever bets we laid off, the money would be there when it's supposed to. Now you're siding with your brother, as if somehow he's right. How wrong is that, Jimmy? You met my uncle, he doesn't have a lot of patience. JOEY. And this is where Bob the Mouth comes in. Bob was a neighborhood loan shark and bookie who would pretty much take action from anybody. Okay? (WHIMPERING) Tell me again how late are you going to be with my money? (SCREAMING) I'll say this about your uncle. He knows how to solve a problem. JOEY. Mainly because he figured there was nobody crazy enough not to pay him. I think me and you need to take this out of Kevin's hands, find this Newton guy, throw him a beating. Do what we gotta do to get the money. How long is it gonna take you to find this Newton? Give me till 3:00. Whitey, go talk to your uncle. Tell him the money's coming by 3:00. You get back here with that money by 2:30. I know he's your brother, but just for a second, you should forget about that and look at him for the whack job that he is. What color is that? Green. Jimmy! We didn't want green. We wanted clover. Jimmy, come here. How am I supposed to get this place painted if I keep getting interrupted? What? I need you to loan me some money. Sure! From my bookmaking business, that you think I shouldn't be doing! Don't bust my balls, Jimmy, I need the money. Okay. Today's your lucky day. 'Cause I actually need something from you, too. What? I don't know what he did or how he did it, but Kevin screwed up. There's a twist. I got three bettors that didn't come up with what they owe. You help Kevin collect, I'll give you 10%. 10% of how much? First you want nothing to do with any of it, and now you're negotiating for a better percentage. Glad to see you're coming around, Tommy. (LAUGHING) JOEY. Of course, Tommy hadn't exactly come around. What he had come to was a decision. An old Irish blessing says, "Wherever you go, "may the luck of the Irish go with you. " Father Dufelt hated old Irish sayings almost as much as he hated people asking him for favors. Here's all I'm saying, I can pick up the phone and make this happen. But it's a favor, and there are only so many of these favors. He wants to go back to school. FATHER DUFELT: You're a semester and a half from you and a high school diploma. All you had to do was show up. You couldn't do it. Now, don't let me waste this favor on you when I could give it to some other kid who really wants it. Put down the cake and talk to the Father. If you don't want to go to school, tell him. Father, I appreciate you being here, and I'm kind of embarrassed that my Mom put you in this spot. Sure. If you think you can get me back into school with my grades being what they are, I think it'd be a good thing for me to try to do. Get my diploma. You know, for my future. You're sure? Yeah. JOEY. I'll get back to that. Because at that moment, Alo was hard at work trying to make a decision of his own. Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop. What? How many times I gotta tell you? Left arm straight. As in, keep your left arm straight. I'm trying! Hit the ball. (GROANS) You're a spastic. I hate golf. I'd rather play sports. Look at the mug on you. Least you could've done was whack him on the back of the head. How you doing, shovelhead? I hope you learned a lesson. Yeah, tempered steel to the head usually does the trick. Ray wanted to finish the job. I wouldn't let him. Any idea why? Punishment wouldn't have fit the crime, Alo. You know, I may be stupid, I never been disloyal to you. And you're an earner. I don't discount that. So what did you learn? You don't want a war. What about you? I learn what he learns. That's good. I like that. So here's what I need you to do. Go make peace with the Irish like I asked and get the money they owe me. You think you can do that? Maybe I should just get the shovel. That's enough. Well? I'll do whatever you need me to do. I don't know how to make this Dokey change his mind, though. Just go talk to him. I got a feeling he might be a little more approachable. All right. Okay, try it again. First Jimmy says he trusts me, then he sends you to look over my shoulder? What kind of trust is that, huh? Okay, you got three collections to make here. They total 15 grand. Here's what we're gonna do. I'm keeping $13,000, you can take the rest. Excuse me, Tommy? You telling me you're gonna rob Jimmy's money? And this is who he sends to watch over me? I'm not telling you anything, Kevin, I'm doing it. You can help me or you can fight me. Either way, I'm doing it. You're seriously gonna rob your own brother, Tommy? That's, like, unethical. I'm not helping you. I'm calling Jimmy. Hey! Put the phone away. Back off, Tommy. Put the phone away. I'm calling Jimmy. I need this, Kevin. When was the last time I asked you for something? You mean before you just asked me to help you rob Jimmy? Huh? I mean ever, Kevin. Never. I don't remember you ever asking me for anything. I'm asking you now. I'm sorry! I don't have it. What would you like me to do? I'm gonna ride this thing to my death until I have the money to pay you, I don't know what else to say, I don't... Oh! God! What'd you have to hit him for, Kevin? That's the way you do it, Tommy. I don't know what to tell you. What, you think he's just gonna give us the money? What universe do you live in? Kevin! Tommy! What do you want from me? See? It's sweaty! I told you I've been working all day. What do you want? MAN: What's going on? What the hell you looking at? Come on, Kevin, let's go. Oh, hey, Kev? Yeah? So, my name's good, right? I can bet this week again? Yeah, no problem. Give me the money. It's sweaty. Kevin! You're taking care of this with Jimmy, all right? 'Cause I'm not lying to him. What are you doing? I'm painting the door like you said. With a trim brush? Yeah, these bigger brushes, they get too heavy. Hey, Jimmy, you got a minute? Do the job right or don't do it at all. Can I not do it at all? Is that a real option? Shut up! What's the matter? Everything all right? Yeah. Look, I gotta make some money, fast. Why? I'm moving out. What are you talking about? I can't handle being at home with Ma anymore. She keeps bugging me about going back to school. No, I quit school once already, I don't want to have to do it again. Wouldn't it be easier just to tell Ma you're not going back? I tried, you know? I couldn't do it. I just don't want to hurt her. Plus she scares the hell out of you. That, too. Look, Jimmy, I know what you been doing around the neighborhood and everything. So? I want to start collecting for you. I'd let you take Kevin's place, but he's doing such a great job. Come on, Jimmy. Seanie, what I'm doing here, it's not for you. Mom's right. Go back to school. That's okay. Maybe I'll go to Dokey. Maybe there's a job for me in construction or at the union. I will shoot you before I let you work for that donkey-face-looks-like-he's- from-the-old-country ass! You want a job? Yeah. Okay. You be my new beverage manager. I like that. I'll be good at that. Hey, you know the first thing I'll do? What? A jukebox. Good music always gets people in. What does that have to do with being a beverage manager? I don't know. No, look, good music, hot girls. Makes guys want to drink more. See, I knew you'd be good at this. Come on. Where you guys going? To buy a jukebox. What about me? You're gonna keep painting. Will do! Can't believe that guy didn't know him! He didn't not know him. He never heard of him. What's that guy know? Maybe he just started working today. He was the owner, Kevin. If Newton worked there, he would've known about it. Yeah. Maybe if we waited a few more minutes... Kevin! Newton doesn't work there. He lied to you. Now, where does he live? I can't believe he lied to me! Where does he live, Kevin? Who? Newton! Uh... What the hell am I looking for? The deed. Oh, yeah. It's in the file cabinet. I know it's in the file cabinet. I'm tired. People forget things when they're tired. But not so tired that I didn't find a way out of our problems, am I? Oh, yeah, Dokey's gonna be a big help. Didn't the bank say they were gonna foreclose? That's not gonna happen now. Give me a little damn credit, will you? I made an appointment with the doctor. A consultation. I'm old, Jenny. I lost a little memory, that's all. You know any old people that hasn't happened to? Tell me this is the right apartment. I guess the guy's not home. He's not home, Tommy! What the hell's going on? You're banging on my door, you're banging on my window? Come outside right now and bring the money with you. (LAUGHING) What money? Kevin, what's going on? Hi, Brian. I thought you were down at the shore. Yeah, I was supposed to be, but my car's in the shop. Who is this nutjob? Kevin, tell me this is Brian Newton. KEVIN: Wish I could. What? I'm Newton. You're Newton? You made the bets? You lost the money? The $10,000? Yes. Yes to all the above. I'm Newton. KEVIN: I'll tell you what I was gonna do, how I was gonna pay Jimmy back. I was thinking favorite, but now, I'm gonna have to go with long shot. A horse? That's your big idea, Kevin? After all this? How can you think about a horse? JOEY. Nobody ever understood why Kevin thought he was lucky. I mean, we all just thought he was crazy! But like most crazy things, there was a reason for it. BOBBY: Kevin, I'm gonna be late! I need a name. I don't know. Okay, let's see. Who's my lucky charm? Tommy? No. You. Me? You. So pick a horse, lucky. Come on, trust your gut. It's a good idea, Tommy. I mean, I was gonna take the money we collect, put it on this horse to win, and then we'd have enough money to pay Jimmy back Newton's money. You want to take the money we have and lose it on a horse? That's where you're wrong, see, I wasn't thinking lose, Tommy. And plus, this isn't just any old horse, all right? I have been waiting weeks for Butterbro to run again. I don't want to hear it. We're gonna take the $3,500 we've already collected and with this $1,500, I'll have enough to try to deal with Dokey. Dokey? He's trying to take Jenny's diner. I can't find it. I thought I had it, but I don't. I guess my husband must have taken it. $1,500? You guess your husband took $1,500 to work? She's lying, Tommy. It's what gamblers do. They lie. Listen, lady, we know you have the money. We don't want any problems, we just want you to pay back what you owe. You're right, I do have it. But it's my rent money. And if I give it to you, then my husband's gonna know that I'm gambling again and he'll take my kids. And I can't let you do that to me. Kevin, will you please find the money? No, no, no, please don't find the money! Please, please don't! Hey, hey, hey, okay. Don't cry, that's not fair. We didn't make the bet. You did. Right. Right. You're just gonna... Listen, could you just give me a second? Just give me half a second, listen. How much could it mean to you? It's only money to you. But this is my life. I'll do it, I'll do anything you want. What? I'll do anything you want, please! KEVIN: I found it! Please, please, don't! Just... I got it right here. Please, don't. Leave it. Leave the money? Yeah. Let's go. What the hell just happened? Don't talk to me, Kevin. You go that way, I'm going this way. Tommy. We could still bet the horse with the money we have! Hey! Here's Napoleon, okay? Now, he's like this big-time emperor, okay? That's like a king, right? Exactly. Just like a king. Now Napoleon and his army, they've been on this major winning streak, okay? They're taking over the world. Napoleon had all these big guns, and he's got more men than your guys, over here, right? Napoleon, he's feeling pretty good. Now, over here you got the Duke of Wellington, and he's the underdog. He's gotta find an angle. So what happens? Rain. See, the one thing that Napoleon did not see coming, and the one thing that Wellington over here was looking for, was it rained buckets, Matthew. Like it never rained before. All of Napoleon's big guns and all of his horses, well, they just weren't worth anything. Because they were all stuck in the mud. Napoleon lost a whole empire in one battle because he didn't see a rainstorm coming. You always gotta look out for the thing that you don't know. Your father never taught me that, but don't hold it against him, you know? It doesn't mean I can't teach you, right? Now, hey... I gotta leave you for a couple of minutes, all right? So why don't you set these guys back up? When I get back, I'll tell you the story of Richard the Lionhearted. It's a much better story, okay? How you doing, guys? Good. So you got something to say? Yeah. I made a mistake. I should never have talked about business the day you buried your brother. All right? I was wrong, and if I insulted you, I apologize. I'm just here to make things right. Yeah, well, whacking my guys didn't help too much, did it? Yeah, well, I already got straightened out for that, all right? Yeah. So here's what we have on the table. Same deal your brother had with Sal. No more, no less. That's fine by me. Good. See you next week. That was easy. Are you surprised? Ain't you? No. Alo had this set up long before we got here. What the hell do these two guys got going on that we don't know about? I don't know. Yeah, well, we better find out. 'Cause if we don't, we're dead. Just a matter of time. Look what you've done to yourself. You used to be a handsome kid. You still on the junk? No. You're a liar. There was a time I would've done anything for you. Now you... You come to me with this garbage who doesn't know how to pay his debts. Despite what your mother thought, and I always hoped, you're nothing but a lying little turd. I expect to get my $10,000. You bring this Jimmy to my place tonight. And if he doesn't have my money, well, while I am reasoning with him, you stick something like this in his back. Uncle Bob, can I say something? No. Just do what I say, or I'll kill you both. Oh! Hi. Hey. It's good to see you. Everything all right? Yeah. Come in. No, thanks. I just came by for a favor. I need to borrow some money. Oh, okay. Sure. I wouldn't say sure until you know how much it is. Then maybe you should tell me. JOEY. Tommy knew she would give him the money. That's why he went to her. How much you need? JOEY. But it wasn't until Tommy looked into Kate's eyes that he knew just how much of a mistake this was. DOKEY: Come on, buddy, let's go. Let's go see Mommy. You know what? This is wrong. DOKEY: You got everything? I'm sorry I bothered you. No, it's fine, he's just dropping Matthew off. It's okay. I'm sorry, I really am. Dokey. Hey, Matthew, how we doing? Hi! Hey. What you doing here, Tommy? Nothing. I just stopped by to say hi to Matthew. Did you come to play with me? I did! But I can see you're here with your Uncle Dokey, so maybe we could do it another time, huh? I'll see you. (ANNOUNCER CHATTERING ON TV) Why do you keep reading this thing, Kevin? Butterbro, that's the horse you been talking about all day. Things change, Tommy. What things change? Track conditions, jockeys change. Let me take care of this, Tommy, all right? I know how to gamble, you don't. It's raining, that's good. But there are other things at work here. What about the... Tommy! Shh. Okay. Butterbro, he's still 13-to-1. Okay. Butterbro. It's a lock. He can't lose. Wait a minute. What? Lester Bangs, he's a mudder, too. I didn't see that. So? Boy, this isn't good. What? Butterbro just went down 5-to-1. So we still get $17,500 back. That's enough. No, not for both of us, Tommy. All right? Let me handle this. There's another horse just as good. Lester Bangs, 14-to-1. Forget the odds. Which horse is gonna win the race, Kevin? Lester Bangs. Put everything on Lester Bangs. Not Butterbro? Lester Bangs. He can't lose. It's all right here. Okay. But wait, wait, come back. You're killing me, Kevin. Pick a horse. Pick Lester Bangs, pick Butterbro, just pick one. I don't know, Tommy. They're both mudders, both carrying 126 pounds. I don't know. Kevin. I trust you. You're a good gambler, no matter what everybody else says. Just pick one. JOEY. Tommy was trying to get Kevin to trust his gut. And that's what Kevin was afraid of. This one. You're sure? Yeah, this one. (LAUGHING) Lester Bangs. He can't lose, Tommy. Put it all on Lester Bangs. Hey, Jenny, father around? He's upstairs. You need something? Would you get him for me, please? I can help you. What do you need? I got papers here from the lawyers and they need your father's signature. I can wait if he's busy, but... Those don't need to be signed till tomorrow. Well, that's not your decision, little girl. Now do me a favor. Go upstairs and get your father, please. He'll sign them tomorrow. When he's supposed to. Okay. Tomorrow it is, then. You mind if we sit down for a minute? Sure, if you're gonna order something. (DOKEY SIGHING) You know, Earl, I don't understand people. Her father comes to me and asks me for a favor. I oblige. And now, she's treating me like I got leprosy. Go figure. I mean, why? Yeah, I think she likes you. It's just her way of showing it. I'll take a steak, medium, a couple of eggs. We don't have any steak. No steak, huh? Well, we're gonna have to fix that. What do you want? I think I want a milkshake. All right. Two milkshakes. What flavor? I don't know, what do you recommend? I don't like milkshakes. I didn't ask you that. I'm not gonna pick for you. What do you recommend, Jenny? I recommend, Dokey, that you turn my father down for that loan he asked you. That's your answer? Well, let me tell you something. It just dawned on me right now that I'm gonna enjoy owning this joint, 'cause I'm gonna make a lot of changes, okay? Now, Earl. Order. Because Jenny is awfully busy with all these customers, as you can see, right? NADINE: There's the Rowe Diamante, a very handsome model. See the grillwork? Metallic. Give you a little sci-fi feel. No sci-fi. Okay, no sci-fi. We've got the AMI Starglow, in many ways ahead of its time. Didn't I just say no sci-fi? Yes, you did. I'm wrong. Let me show you this. Over here we have the Rowe B-13. This is your lady. Yeah, that's beautiful. Yeah, but $6,000? Don't worry about the price. You're going to need a CD package. I can set it up. I can get you a little bit of everything. Rap, easy listening, classic rock, The Doors, The Byrds, The Monkees. The Monkees? I hate The Monkees. I see them in the street, I'll beat the pus out of them. Probably don't have to worry about that, Jimmy. So we'll leave The Monkees out. It's 3:00, man! We're supposed to be at my uncle's now! We're not there, Jimmy. Kevin never showed with the money? No. I'm at... I'm at the Firecracker by myself! You're not there, Kevin's not there. Just that idiot with the small brush! He says you're out buying a jukebox. (TELEPHONE RINGING) He's not answering 'cause he doesn't have it. Call your uncle. Tell him we're running late. I can't do that! Why not? He says if I don't show up with the money, we gotta go by his place tonight and explain why. That means he's gonna want to kill us. Maybe, maybe not. He is my uncle. No, he's gonna want to kill us! It's Lester Bangs in the lead... Come on! MAN: Come on! Come on! JOEY. Remember I told you the reason Kevin thought he was lucky? Yes! I won! I won! Yes! I won! Come on! Come on! Come on, Lester. Come on! JOEY. But it wasn't because he won that race. It was because it was the last thing that his father ever said to him. And who wouldn't hold on to that? You got it! Come on, Lester Bangs. Come on, let's go, go, go! Lester Bangs! Run! He's gonna do it! Lester Bangs! Come on! Come on! Lester Bangs! ANNOUNCER. It's Butterbro at the finish, wins by a nose! Butterbro, you whore. I knew it. I knew it, too. I don't know anything about horses, but I know this. For a lucky guy, Kevin, you're the worst gambler in the world. I put everything we had on Butterbro. Your first pick. You pulled through, buddy. What floor is it? Seventeenth. All right, Whitey. We both know your uncle's gonna want to kill me. Well, I figure he asked you to set me up. How you gonna do it? (BELL DINGS) I'm supposed to stab you in the back. Great! Wait a minute. Stop. So you're telling us that Jimmy Donnelly killed Robert Kelly? Actually, I'm not saying that. I can't even tell you how what happened, happened next. Or even why. But I can tell you what happened. Jimmy left Sean outside as a lookout to keep him out of harm's way. Hello. JOEY. Unfortunately, it was about a foot and a half from where Bob the Mouth's body landed. Tommy, how am I gonna go to the Firecracker and tell Jimmy I don't have his money? Do what I told you, Kevin. Tell him we collected the money from Newton and I took it. I can't do that. I'm no good at lying. Actually, you're really good at lying. You don't think you lied when you took Newton's bets? I wasn't lying. I took the money. I knew I was Newton. Now, what you gotta do is stop lying to yourself and admit you're a great liar. Is Jenny around, Mr. Reilly? No. Any idea when she'll be back? No. Can we go talk to Jimmy now? You're late! Where's my money? Newton wasn't around. Kevin, you promised me you'd get that money! Yeah, that might have been a mistake. Okay, so no Newton. Where's the rest? All right, Jimmy, I can't lie to you. We did collect $3,500, but we put it on a horse, and Tommy picked the horse, so I think he should keep all the money. Kevin, what is the matter with you? What? I'm trying to help you out, all right? Besides, I told you, I'm no good at lying. Wait a minute! Let me get this straight. You collected my $3,500, you bet it all on a horse, the horse won, and now you're telling me you want to keep it all? Not Kevin, me. I told you this morning, Jimmy, I need the money. I'm keeping it. Really? You're keeping my money? It's the way it's gotta be, Jimmy. Ooh, I think I missed a spot over there. Okay, Tommy, no problem. But you should know the money wasn't mine. It's Bob the Mouth's. The money you're stealing belongs to Bob the Mouth. Yeah, I forgot to tell you. Tommy, you know how Bob operates. I'm gonna have to kill him, 'cause he's gonna wanna kill me. JOEY. Jimmy left out the part about Bob taking a walk on air. If that's okay with you, it's okay with me. JOEY. Now, to anyone else, this is a simple dilemma. You save the life of a despicable human being, or you help the person you love most in the world. You know what, Jimmy? You do whatever you gotta do. JOEY. But Tommy always made things harder on himself than most guys. Here you go. (DOORBELL RINGING) I'm so sorry to do this. Did it ever occur to you that it feels good for me to be able to help? I'm gonna pay you back. Every cent. That's not important. You okay? Yeah, I'm good. Sean, Bob the Mouth belongs where he belongs. He doesn't count. Now you and me and Kevin and Tommy? That's all that counts.
