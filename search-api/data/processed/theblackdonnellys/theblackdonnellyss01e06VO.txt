something interesting, frozen hamburgers in the oven. Mr. Reilly said he didn't do it. Strange. Thanks to Dokey, people are still losing their toes. No! Let's hope he finds his brother's killer soon. Nicky's looking for power. He beat up Sean Donnelly, which got his boss, Sal, killed. And he's been getting closer to his new boss, Alo. Smart! Since he's looking to take his place. Little Sean's finally out of the hospital, but he thinks he's lost his looks. Meanwhile, Jimmy found something. Louie's cell phone with his entire bookmaking business. (CASH REGISTER DINGS) Jackpot! Speaking of jackpots, that bread guy, Samson? Thought he won big when he found Jenny. Boy, was he wrong. Jenny knew the whole thing was a mistake. She tried to fix it. You could have lied to me. Me? I've always believed honesty is best served cold. MAN. What are you being stupid for? Why can't you get it through that thick skull of yours that we're trying to help you? No, no, I got it. You're just a couple of good guys. See, here's the problem. Always trying to help people, it'll kill you. And it's worse than a disease. Tommy Donnelly was just beginning to figure that out. Hey. Hey. I figured you might need this stuff. It's the trays from Huey's wake. Thanks. So how long you been sitting out there? Not long. All night? Pretty much. On the counter here okay? Yeah, sure. Sorry, Jenny. I'm gonna have to do this COD. Excuse me? Yeah, they told me to get cash. George, it's obviously a mistake. I'll just sign it like I usually do, okay? What? What's this? Last three months, overdue. I'm sorry. Is everything all right? It's fine. You need anything? I'm good, thanks. Okay. I'll see you, then? Yeah. Been some kind of mistake. I'm gonna go call the office. Meanwhile, while helping themselves to Louie Downtown's bookmaking action, Jimmy and Kevin ran into a minor problem. KEVIN: Jimmy, it's Eddie Maxwell, all right? Please. I don't feel right about this. We know this guy our entire lives. He owes us money. He owes Louie money. Stop saying that, Kevin. We have a chance to get a little respect here and you want to throw it all away because of Maxwell? I never liked the guy anyway. What if he tells Louie's people what we're doing? Then he'll really have a problem. Hey. Guys, how you doing? Hey, Eddie, how are you? Good. What's up? Picking up for Louie, that's all. Oh, that was you guys on the phone? You're working for Louie? Yeah. Yeah? Get out of here. No, no, really. He didn't tell you? You're asking me to give you Louie's money? The money I bet with Louie? Five grand, that's the figure, right? You're out of your mind. Come on, Jimmy. Let's go. Eddie. Your figure for the week's five large. You're really serious? As a heart attack. I bet with Louie. Tell him to stop by if he wants his money. Give me the money you owe or I'm gonna break both your legs and burn your store down with you in it, you understand? Understand this. My hand is on a.38 automatic under the counter. We know each other a long time. Don't make me use it. (GUNSHO TS) I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached. All right, I'll see you after the dentist. What are you doing? Where's all the money, Dad? What money? The deposits. The weekly deposits. According to these statements, there's no money in our accounts. What are you talking about? Both accounts are overdrawn, and we've been bouncing checks. Over a dozen in the last week. What are you, crazy? Did you deposit the money? Of course I did. Do you have the deposit slips? Dad? What? Where's the money? It's in the bank. I've got the deposit slips right here. Right here. Right next to the stamps. Where the hell are the stamps? It's okay, Dad. I'll call the bank, we'll figure out what happened. You deposited the money, I'm sure it's there. The bank made a mistake. Thirty years, I been banking there. I'll get our money. They'll cover the bounced checks. Don't worry so much. Hey! Hey, Tommy? Got a minute? Hey, Eddie. What's up? What's going on with your brother, Jimmy? He's trying to shake me down. What are you talking about? I lost a couple bets to Louie Downtown. Jimmy comes to me, says I have to pay him Louie's money. What do you mean, he wants you to pay him? Well, he says he's collecting for Louie. Tommy what happens when Louie shows up? What do I do then, pay two people? And plus, I'm down 500, he says I owe 5,000. And, Tommy, he comes into my store and makes a punk out of me in front of my wife. What the hell is that? I'm sorry, Eddie. I'll talk to Jimmy. We'll straighten it out, okay? Look, I don't want to have to take this to Dokey, we know each other too long, that's why I came to you. But the truth is I'm in the right. I got a legitimate beef here. Don't do anything till I talk to Jimmy, okay? No, no. No problem, Tommy. It's not your fault, it's just Jimmy. I know. I appreciate it, Eddie. Okay? Okay. The Donnellys were always looking to me for help. Where's Jimmy? I don't know. JOEY. I did what I could. Do you want your ass kicked? He's in the basement with Kevin. Where is he? I wouldn't start anything if I were you. Since when are you collecting bets for Louie Downtown? Since I found his phone down here covered in his brains. What do you think the Italians are gonna do when they find out you're collecting Louie's bets? Money that's supposed to be going to them? To hell with the Italians. This is for Eddie Maxwell. Jimmy! Jimmy! Hey! You gonna shoot Eddie Maxwell over money he owes Louie? It's my money. My money. Come on, Jimmy. He embarrassed me, Tommy. He stuck a gun in my face! Me and Kevin had to run out of there with our tails between our legs. You think that's okay? Did he really do that? What are you asking him for? He didn't actually shove it in our faces, he just kind of showed it to us. I mean, he didn't even show it to us, actually... You know what, Kevin? Shut up! I'm building up business here, Tommy. I let Maxwell get away with that, don't you think the next guy's gonna try the same thing? You're really gonna shoot a guy we know all our lives over a stinking $500 he doesn't even really owe you? He told you that? That he owes $500? He's willing to pay, Jimmy, okay? Leave it alone. I'll get you the money. Five thousand! Five hundred. You believe him? You believe him over me? He's not a $5,000 bettor, Jimmy, you know that. MX is for Maxwell. 426 is the address of his shop. You don't believe me? Maxwell Printing, hello. Ten bets, $500 a pop. Lost every bet. Guy makes Kevin look lucky! What do you gotta say that for? He knows you and Mary Ann had a thing, so he's using you. He's playing you for a jerk. Okay. Maybe he lied to me. But you still can't kill him. You want to play Mother Teresa? Go ahead. You get me my $5,000. And maybe the next time I see him, I'll just give him a beating. Otherwise, I'm gonna do Mary Ann a favor, I'm gonna make her a widow. I'll get you the money. I think Tommy's right. We should get rid of the phone. You don't like money, Kevin? Or you just don't want to make our lives better, which is it? Who's to say the Italians aren't gonna find out, huh? I mean, who says Maxwell's not talking to Nicky right now? All right, we ditch the phone. But first we gotta get the names and numbers off of it so we can set up our own book. You know how to do that? You don't know? You spend your whole life losing money and you don't know how to make book? I know how to bet, Jimmy, it's not the same. Joey, come here. Yeah. You know anything about setting up book? About the same as Kevin, except I won a bet once. What do you want, a smack? What? I'm just saying. Does anybody know anybody? This guy, Whitey, I used to bet with. Whitey's a sleaze bag. Worse than you? Maybe. Kevin introducing Jimmy to Whitey was gonna result in one of the most gruesome and violent deaths the neighborhood had ever seen. (GROANING) I mean, what did Kevin know? He was only trying to help. Jimmy. Whitey. Was Whitey gonna kill Jimmy, or was Jimmy gonna kill Whitey? So who killed who? When? In the knife fight. Oh. That was later. In the beginning... In the beginning, Jimmy and Whitey looked like a marriage made in heaven. What you want to do is ditch this phone after you download the betting codes and the client numbers in a laptop. Then you gotta record all the bets in case of a challenge. That means software and a USB port. If you want me to understand any of that, you're gonna have to say it in English. All right. Bottom line is, you buy a couple new cell phones, transfer everything to a SIM card. I could just do it if you want to make it worth my while. KEVIN: That sounds good. How does that sound good? He didn't even give us a price yet. How much? To set it up, or work the action, too? Everything. There's three of us, how about partners? A third each. I just met you five minutes ago, and you're trying to hustle me. I'm not trying to hustle anybody. You make me an offer you think is fair. Me and my three brothers are the only partners I'm ever gonna have. You want to work with us, you get 10%. Otherwise, take it on the hop. How do I know you're not gonna dump me after I set the whole thing up? You don't. Now that you know that, what do you wanna do about it? Dokey around? You got a name? You don't know my name? That's cute. Nicky. Cottero. Hey, Nicky, come on in. Good to see you. You're pretty good with that thing, I hear. Oh, you know, lots of practice. So did you come here to tell me who killed my brother? When I find out, you're gonna be the first one I bring it to. Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. So what are you doing here? There's an offer on the table. You mean the one where I pay you guineas 20% of the take from my own territory? That offer? You get our union support, you get our judges and our cops for that 20%. Now, that's the same offer that Sal had for your brother. Yeah, and look where that got Huey, huh? Alo needs an answer. Me? I'd like to come back here and make better use of that axe. You're a funny guy. Tell you what, you go back and you tell Alo that I'm giving his offer all the attention it deserves. Okay? But my instincts, they're telling me, "No." I guess we're done here. Hey. Let me walk you out. Where is everybody? You had guys out here? Doke, they were here a minute ago. Tommy! Hey. Let me help you out with this. Yeah, right, like I don't do this all day long? Right. JOEY. If there never was a Jenny, Mary Ann would have been the one for Tommy. Everybody knew it. Especially Maxwell. How you been? I'm good. Good. What about you guys? Thank God, things are good. I was looking for Eddie. He's on a run. Want me to call him? No. No, I'll come back. How's he doing? It's all turned around for us, Tommy. I'm happy for you. He just bought the shop, can you imagine? Everything's good, right? Yeah. Yeah, why? Kevin and Jimmy were in this morning. So? So... If there was something wrong, you would tell me, right? I would, if there was something wrong. Anyway, bunch of guys are going to the game Sunday. I thought Eddie might want to come. Have him give me a call, will you? I'll tell him. You look good. I'm jealous. You had your shot. Don't remind me. (PHONE RINGING) It's Kim, leave a message. Hey, Kim, this is Sean, what's up? It's, like, the third time I've called. Call me back, huh? I wouldn't mind getting together. I miss you. I'm lonely. You're the only one that can help. Help. Help. SOS. Calling all Kims! (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey. You're awake. How you feeling? Good. Who you talking to? Kim, I just got busted. Call me back, huh? I'm making lunch, honey. How about a nice bacon and egg sandwich? Love it. It's Kim, leave a message. While Helen was helping Sean to a nice bacon and egg, Whitey and Jimmy were helping themselves to something entirely different. Kevin, on the other hand, could've used a little help himself. Hey! Hey, Joanie? It's Jimmy. You want to make $200 a week? No, you don't gotta do nothing. Just let us use your apartment. Hey, Tommy. You lied to me, Eddie. Hey, Tommy. No. Don't do it. Don't lie to me again. You're down 5,000, not 500. Okay. I'm down 5,000. But, Tommy, you can't blame me for not giving it to Jimmy. What do I do if Louie shows? Louie's not showing up, and that's not a guess, Eddie. Can you pay it? Five thousand? Not even close. Mary Ann said you guys bought the shop, that it's going good. So why you want to screw that up now? For three years, I didn't make a bet. Wake up one day, and I can't stop myself. Hey, will you talk to Jimmy for me? I just need a little time. That would've been a little easy if you hadn't pulled a gun on them... I never had a gun. I made him think I had one under the counter. I mean, what was I supposed to do? Take a beating in front of my wife? Don't do that. Don't hide behind Mary Ann. All I'm... All I'm saying is, I don't want to lose her. How much can you put together? Maybe half. Go get it. Not with Mary Ann inside. I'll meet you back here, 9:00. You're not playing me again, are you? I wouldn't lie to you, Tommy. All right. Plug in Louie's cell phone. No, no, no, use the USB cable. What cable? The one in your right hand. Plug it into the data port. We back up the numbers off Louie's phone into the... Who is this guy? He's one of Kevin's friends. He's a skell. I'm changing my mind. I don't want this guy in my house. You can't change your mind. We already stole everything. I don't want this guy in my apartment. You should have told me about him before I agreed to anything. You want the $200 a week or not? Oh, yeah. Like I'm really gonna see that. WHITEY: Louie must have half the city on this thing. I am so gonna regret this. We gotta keep these phones on at all times. That means we gotta work them right out of the chargers. Hey. You done with that? What's up? You sure this Whitey guy knows what he's doing? He talks, I have no idea what he's saying. He used to be a bookmaker, Jimmy, that's all I know about him. If I let you throw this phone in the river, and I find out later we lost all the numbers, I'm gonna choke you, Kevin, you understand? Why do I have to throw it away? Because I'm staying and you're leaving. Where am I going? To get rid of the phone. I don't understand why I gotta do everything. Whoa, whoa! What's going on? The whole time you're gone, he won't stop looking down my shirt! I wasn't! You staring at her chest, buddy? Jimmy, I never, I swear... JOANIE: You liar! I don't know what she's talking about. Get out of my house. You skeeve me, you son of a bitch! Joanie, stop hollering. Are you taking his side? I'm not taking anyone's side. I'm trying to figure out what's going on! I want him out of my house! No one's going out anywhere, just stop! Everyone quiet. Now, Whitey, were you checking her out or not? I wasn't. He says he wasn't staring at your rack, Joanie. Maybe you made a mistake. Yeah. Maybe I made a mistake when I heard him call you a gimp. Did you do that, Whitey? Come on, Jimmy, she doesn't like me. WHITEY: I don't know why. Sure you didn't say that? 'Cause people say that behind my back all the time. It's not a big deal. He called you a gimp. Jimmy, I swear... You are a liar! Joanie! No more throwing cups, no more hollering, that's it! You suck. I can't believe you believe a skank like this over me. Joanie. He's my new business associate. If the scumbag was checking you out inappropriately, he'd tell me. Right, Whitey? Right. (CELL PHONE RINGING) What? You want me to take $2,500 on a $5,000 dollar bet that Maxwell made? It wasn't even your bet to begin with, Jimmy. It's a good deal. For you, maybe, 'cause you're the jerk who believes this guy. JENNY: Dad, I don't understand, just please tell me what... You want me to take $2,500? Fine, I'll take $2,500. You want to know why? Because Maxwell is a welcher. He's not even gonna have half that. What he is gonna have is that gun underneath the counter. If there are no deposit receipts, and no ATM records, then maybe they're right. Maybe you didn't make the deposits. What are you doing, Jenny? You calling your father a liar? No. I'm saying I don't know how we're gonna pay our bills. It wasn't just the butcher, it's every single one of our vendors. It's our dairy... You better take this. No, I'm not gonna need it. You will if you want to get my money. Don't worry, I'm gonna get the money. Get your brother. Yo, Seanie, dinner! I could've done that. What are you so happy about? Been calling Kim all day. I can't get her to return the call. I don't understand it. You know what I think it is? I think that she saw me get my ass kicked. Either that or the fact that Mom threatened to kick Kim's ass if she ever came around here again. Did you do that, Ma? You should be grateful she's out of your life. You're going back to school, you'll have no time for girls. I wish you hadn't done that, Ma. I wish your father was still alive and I lived in the country. Eat! JENNY: Dad! What are you doing? What? You're putting the money in the mailbox. What are you talking about? I'm making a deposit. You're at the mailbox. Dad, the bank's over there. Oh! I guess I got a little confused. Thought I was gonna mail a letter, but I was going to the bank. Lucky thing you stopped me. Yeah. No big deal. Okay. Let's go home. Okay. Here. Deposit this. Hey. Don't try to be nice, Tommy. I know why you're here. Did Eddie send you? No, he didn't send me, Tommy. I came on my own. Eddie's afraid to come. He thought Jimmy'd be here. I'm sorry, Mary Ann. I wish he wouldn't have told you. I wish you would've told me. I'm trying to take care of it. He turned his life around, Tommy. I know he gambled again. But he gave up the drink and all the other stuff. He turned out to be a good husband. I know you never liked him. But Eddie's a good guy at heart. And I'm asking you to do me a favor. Don't let Jimmy hurt him. It's all there. The whole 500. Five hundred? That's what he lost, right? Five hundred. I'll give it to Jimmy. You deserve better. Maybe. But he's what I got. WHITEY: Customer asks for our betting line, you give this line, the one that I make up. Always make sure to check the board before you give the line, I could've just changed it. All right, customer places a bet, you confirm. Always make them repeat the bet before you turn off the recorder. We good? I like the Jets at seven and a half. Whoa! You can't bet. Why not? I'm good for it. Jimmy. If we start taking bets from ourselves, the whole business is gonna go south. It's like a dealer doing his own junk, it just can't happen, okay? We gotta be clear about this, Jimmy. Shut up, Whitey, he's not gonna bet. What, you think he's an idiot? Kevin, you're not allowed to bet. That sucks. What about customers? We can't just rely on Louie's people. Yeah, I mean, especially since we haven't been paying off the winners. Whoa, whoa, that's gotta stop. We have to pay off the winners. A book works on its reputation. You know what? Just because you know a thing or two, don't get smart with me. 'Cause it'll take me about a half a minute to throw you through the window. Okay. You don't want to pay the winners, don't pay them. I didn't say I wasn't gonna pay them. I'm just telling you not to tell me to pay them. Thank you. Where do we find new customers? I know a lot of gamblers, I'll start passing the word. You don't want gamblers. You want losers. My name is Chris, I haven't made a bet in sixteen weeks. I always felt lucky. No matter how many times I lost the rent, or my kids went hungry, or how many bets I lost in a row. I was always sure... He remind you of anybody? ...that fortune would smile down on me... No. He doesn't remind you of anybody? ...and that my whole life would turn around. But that day never came. You're making a point, right? Hey, Whitey, how much more of this crap we gotta sit through? WHITEY: So I'm like, "I don't even watch the games anymore." That's how not into betting I am. MAN 1: Right. But this guy, he don't let up, he's like, you know... He gives me his number, he gives me his card, he gives me... He gives me a code. I'm like, "I don't bet anymore. "What part of that don't you understand?" Lmagine that? Yeah. But, okay, I admit, I gotta admit, if I ever did get back into betting, this is the guy that I would bet with. Two-to-one, his lines are way off. I'd be hitting middles left and right with this guy, you know, making a fortune. What's his name? Who? The guy. Oh, the guy with the office? He gave me his card, I got, like, a ton of them right here. Really? Give me one. MAN 2: Let me see one. MAN 3: Can I get one, as well? Yeah, me too. You never know, right? Never know! WOMAN: Can I see one of those? Yes. All right, thanks. What the hell are we doing here? Don't even think about it, Vinnie. (GROANS) I tell you to start a war? (GROANS) Where are you? Where are you? (GROANS) Tell me what this place is. I don't know! That's right, you don't know. I tell you to do something, I expect you to do it, you understand? You understand? You okay? Get off me. Guy had a gun to my head, what am I gonna do? You could've died! What the hell is this place? JOEY. Tommy hated Jimmy for getting him into this mess. He hated Maxwell for being such a lying scumbag. He even hated Mary Ann for being the nice girl that she was. There was only one person he didn't hate. And even if he couldn't admit it to himself, she was the only reason he went in to get the money. Hey! I want the money. Hey. Take it easy, Tommy, I can explain. No, I want the money. I gave you everything I had. $500 is all you have? No, you're a liar. Know what? Fine. I'm a liar. Now what? Oh, you beat me up, Tommy? No, I'm sorry, that's not you, that's your brother Jimmy, right? You know what? Maybe next time Jimmy comes around, I'll have a real gun under the counter. You're gonna shoot me? You're gonna shoot me, Eddie? Where's the safe? What? Where's the safe you have all the money... I don't have a safe, okay? Where's the safe? Over there! (SCREAMING) Count out 5,000. JOEY. The thing about helping people is you can only take it so far. And then you start hurting them. Oh, my God. No, I never... JENNY: Hey. Hey, how you doing? This your regular route? Yeah, why? Can I help you with something? You do all the pickups here? Yeah, that's right. It's not there today, huh? You disappointed? I don't know what you're talking about, lady. Sure you do. Because every week for the last six weeks, you found a night deposit pouch in there full of money. It belonged to my father! It had his name on it, it had the bank's name on it. Now I want it back, every penny. Lady, I don't know what you're talking about. We both know you do. It's not your money. It's our money. Please, give it back. Lady, if you lost some mail then why don't you call this number? No, I called the post office. They said nothing's been turned in. That means you found it and you kept it. Look, you think I did something wrong, why don't you file a complaint? They got rooms full of people down there to handle that kind of stuff. Now excuse me, I got a schedule to keep. How can you live with yourself? I have no idea what you're talking about. (GROANS) JOEY. Jack Trevor was a neighborhood guy made good. He went from union delegate to district leader to city councilman before he was 35. Best hot dogs in the city down here. Better than Frankie Balls in the neighborhood, don't you think? Yeah, it's a great hot dog. So what's on your mind, councilman? Come on, let's walk. You know what makes them the best? The onions. He puts chili pepper in. From Paraguay. I asked him once, every day for a year I asked him, he finally gave it up. So ever since that day, I been exploring buying chili pepper from Paraguay. You know why? I don't know, 'cause you like hot dogs? I wanted his secret. You know a man's secrets, you know him. You know, I can smell that you're trying to make a point, Jack, so... I'm sorry about Huey. But you guys weren't very close, were you? We didn't always see eye-to-eye, but he was my brother, you know? Yeah, but you weren't close, because if you were, then Jimmy Whalen and Harry Doyle and Mike Flynn would still be alive and working in your hall, instead of having their blood-spattered bodies all over the front pages of the city's newspapers. That doesn't help, Dokey. That kind of thing doesn't help. That's what Huey knew. Yeah, well, don't worry, I'm gonna take care of that. Now that would be a mistake. But how would you know that? Because you and your brother weren't close. If you were, he would've told you the reasons why he and Sal Minnetta fought so damn hard to keep the peace between us and the Italians. Well, why don't you give me one? A secret or a reason? You pick, Jack. I'll give you a hundred million of them. And then you're gonna break your ass to give me back the peace that your brother and Sal set up. Finish your dog and then we'll stop by my office. JOEY. People say, in the old days, Jack, Bobby Donnelly, and Huey Farrell were pretty tight. The fact that Jack Trevor was the last one standing surprised nobody. Maxwell's paid up. Look at you. I want a cut. No problem. Half. Oh, Tommy got a taste, huh? Half, Jimmy. Dude, what's the deal with this jerk? Why are we letting him get away with this? You let him get away with that? Jeez! Joey, get me another beer. Get Whitey a towel, he's bleeding all over my floor. JOEY. Me? I wasn't afflicted with the help disease like Tommy was, so I let Whitey stew a bit. And even though Jenny had told Tommy she didn't need his help when it came to Jenny, Tommy just didn't know how not to try. $8.25. Hey. Listen, I found this in the bathroom. Weirdest thing. It fell out from behind the tank, like somebody stashed it back there or something. Like my dad? Beats me. Only if it were my dad, it would be in a night deposit pouch. It's a lot of money. Yeah. Where'd you get it? Like I said, in the bathroom. Yeah, sure. I don't want your money. It's not my money. What'd you do? What did you do to get that money? Something terrible, right? You don't want the money, Jenny, you can burn it. So, guys, anything else
