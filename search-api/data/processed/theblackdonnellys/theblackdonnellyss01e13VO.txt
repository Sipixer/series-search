With the Donnelly boys, it all started out as good clean fun. A little carjacking, a bit of extortion, a few fights here and there. You know, what all boys do. Even that thing Jenny had with Samson started out harmless. Then things took a turn. But there was one moment when all fun stopped. DOKEY: Who wants to shave their head? Me, I'll go. Dokey motor-oiled my ass! It broke my heart. Of course, Tommy couldn't let that go. So he sent Dokey a thank-you note. Dokey didn't like that much. You're dead! But like they say, "All good things come to a head." MAN: You lied to your lawyers, to the grand jury, to your priest. I swear to God... I think you lied to him, too. Now, see, people like you, you don't get it. The Donnellys are like... Like your brothers, I know. Joey, at a certain point, you're gonna have to start telling us a little bit of the truth. You don't know anything. You just look at what happened, not why or how it happened. JOEY. See, after beating up Dokey, Tommy'd had enough. He reached his limit. He stepped up to the precipice, looked over the edge, saw the face of the monster below, and knew it was him. Put it away. JOEY. And he decided, no matter what the stakes, no matter what it cost, he was gonna save himself and his family. KEVIN: Tommy! What are we gonna do, Tommy? I'm working on it, Kevin. We should've killed Dokey is what we should have done. There were like a hundred people watching us, Kevin. They were neighborhood people, Tommy, they weren't gonna give us up. Most of them would like to kill Dokey themselves. I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life, Kevin. I sure as hell don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life with you. I don't know what you were thinking, but it wasn't about any witnesses. Get the back door next, then the cellar. I don't want to go in the cellar. What if they're down there already? Then you're gonna need this. Go. You know, bullets do have the ability to go through two-by-fours. What are we gonna do, Tommy? We can't hide here forever. Call Sean. Tell him to get Ma, take her out to Aunt Kitty's on Greenwood Lake. Ma hates Aunt Kitty. JOEY. Since they were kids, Helen had promised the boys they'd go visit their Aunt Kitty in Greenwood Lake, New Jersey. No, you know what, Kitty? Fine. Have your own damn barbecue! She invites us to her house for the weekend, asks us to bring the meat! This mean we're not going to Greenwood Lake? TOMMY: Tell Sean to get Ma and make it happen. So you do have a plan, you're just not telling me. Would you just do it, Kevin? And keep an eye on the windows. I'll be back. Tommy, where you going? You can't go outside. TOMMY: Lock the door. Give your man a kiss, baby. He's going to work. Hey, I hope you got napkins, 'cause we're all out. Good morning to you, too. Hi, Jen. Dad, you okay? Yeah, I told you I'd be doing the pickups myself this morning, didn't I? Lucky we ran into each other. What are the chances, huh? Just leave that one here, we'll take the shelves inside, okay? Hey, how about a couple of cups of coffee, huh, Jen? Hey. Tommy. What are you doing here? You heard what happened with Dokey? Yeah, everybody has. Jenny, you've been right the whole time. When I killed Huey and Sal, I vomited for days. It was all I could think about. But when I was beating Dokey last night, nothing. You know what I was thinking while I was kicking him? "Where can I put the body?" That's what Tommy wanted to tell Jenny. But as they say, "Timing is everything." IAN: Still waiting on those coffees, Jen. What did you want? Nothing. Never mind. Tommy... IAN: So I figure right there, where that bulletin board is. I'll take that down. I think they'll fit. I think that'll look really nice, Mr. Reilly. I measured it this morning, so it should be all right. Yeah, maybe a little bit over. Jenny, how about those coffees, huh? Little bit over this way, what do you think? I think it's gonna be great, Mr. Reilly. All right, I'll get the tools. (GUNSHO TS) Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got a couple of broken ribs, you can't be moving around too much. Just sit tight. I'll be back in a minute. Earl, I want the Donnellys dead. You understand? All four of them. We may have bigger problems, Doke. I left messages for everybody. Jackie's the only one who picked up. Nobody's calling back. They're waiting to see how this thing shakes down. Really? Well, you call Jackie and you tell Jackie I want everybody down at the union hall. And you have them wait for me. Guess who? What does he want? He wants to know why Tommy Donnelly kicked Dokey's ass up and down the street last night. He wants us to go over there? Yeah. And like the dogs we are, we'll go. Yeah, we'll be there. You get that thing I asked you to get? JOEY. Now, even in times of war, not everybody gets the word. Especially if you've been getting cozy with the civilians. (CELL PHONE RINGING) It's my brother. You screen out people you don't want to talk to? That's lame. It's just my brother. I mean, they're the kiss of death for me. They either wanna borrow my car, or they want me to work at the bar for free. Listen, so you know, we can fool around, but there's something you should know. That you're not really a girl? That's okay by me, they did a great job. I'm a virgin. Whoa. Is that a problem? Depends. Is that like a lifetime thing, or is it just until you meet the right guy? Until marriage. Whoa. Another whoa, that's not good. No! No, no. Uh, whatever. I just never met anyone really sticking to that before. I mean, it's cool, I guess. Look, I'm dying here, okay? I'm dying. But... No, that's fine. (POUNDING ON DOOR) What's wrong with you? Where have you been? You know how worried we are? You could be dead somewhere! Kevin, stop. All right, so I got good news. You remember Dickie, right? Hey, Dickie. What up, Tommy? Look what Dickie brought us. What is this? It's a rocket launcher. A rocket launcher? Dickie, where'd you get a rocket launcher? From my brother. He was over there with the Arabs. Take it back to your brother. I think he may still need it. No, no, no, Tommy, he's in on this. We're with you, me and my brother. It's cool, huh? Do you even know how to use a rocket launcher? No, but how hard could it be? Dickie's brother used it. Hey, Tommy, me and my brother, we're banking on you against Dokey. We don't want nothing for it. JIMMY: Hey, Tommy! Good to see you showed up! You see what Dickie brought us? Dickie, tell your brother we said thanks. You got it. We don't need his help, Jimmy. Really? 'Cause after that bonehead play you made last night, beating Dokey up and not killing him, real smart, Tommy. I think we need all the help we could get. I'm working on a better idea. Well, you better cough it up. Dokey could be here any minute. We need to stop this. Stop the killings. That's our way out. How is that an idea? I'm not gonna let us turn into Huey and Dokey. Well, you picked a hell of a time to find your conscience. I don't have a conscience. Doesn't bother me. That might be the problem here, Kevin. While you're out saving your soul, Tommy, I'm gonna go save the family. Hey, Joey. Come on, let's go. JOEY: Where we going? To blow Dokey's ass up! But I'm not done nailing things yet. That's not funny, Jimmy. What if it's got a hair trigger on it or something? You gotta pull the pin out first, dope. Kevin, where you going? I'm not leaving Jimmy alone out there. Dokey could be anywhere. He's not alone. He's with Joey. And he's got a pocket full of grenades. You talk to Sean? I left him a message. But you didn't talk to him? You wanna help somebody? Get Sean and bring him to Ma's. That's your choice, Sean and Ma or Jimmy. That sucks. MAN. Twenty-third Precinct. Detective Stein, please? I like what you've done to the place. Thanks for coming, Frankie. I appreciate it. Gotta tell you, Tommy, kicking Dokey's ass and then not killing him? Dumb. I need a way out from under. You mean you want Dokey off the street? I'll turn state's evidence, I'll testify, whatever it takes. You got anything you can testify to in front of a jury that I can corroborate? I know things. It doesn't matter what you know. What can you prove? Otherwise, I lock him up today, he's out tomorrow, nothing's changed. I'll get close to him. I'll wear a wire. Get you whatever you need. After last night, you get close to him? He shoots you. Then again, if that happens, at least I got something on him. I'm in. Jesus. You got yourself in the soup. I need help, Frankie. I'll put a couple of cops outside the bar. Maybe a couple outside your house. But for all we know, they're on Dokey's payroll. You want my advice? Get out. Take your mother, your brothers, don't come back. Your father would have been disappointed. JOEY. Bobby Donnelly was as middle-class as they come. For him, the American dream was the family vacation. This time, they were going to Niagara Falls. HELEN: We're taking these down. Come on, Bobby, shake a leg. We're coming, we're coming. Guys, right here, look. We follow this route, and we go across the longest stone bridge in the whole wide world. All right? And we wind up here, lthaca. Are you ready? They've got a Jell-O museum. TOMMY: Mom! JOEY. Mrs. Donnelly had just fallen down the stairs. Nothing serious, but Jell-O land was definitely out of the question. I wanna know what the hell is going on, Kevin, and I wanna know it now. I don't know, Ma. You're a liar! You find Sean? KEVIN. Not yet. Where are you? Home. What are you doing at home, Kevin? Who's that? I looked everywhere, Sean's not... Who's on the phone? Kevin, is that Tommy? Give me the phone! KEVIN. Stop hollering at me! Don't you shout at me! I'm shouting at Tommy. There's been a change of plans. We're not going to Aunt Kitty's, we're just going. Going where? What? Somebody's going somewhere? Just tell her to pack her bags and be ready to go. I'm gonna find Seanie. Tommy, you know Ma hates leaving the house! I am not leaving the house! Give me the phone! Don't put her on! Kevin! Kevin! Ma! Stop! Tommy, I'm worried out of my mind. Where is Sean, where is Jimmy, and where the hell are you? Ma. You gotta trust me on this. Pack some bags, just what you need. When we get to where we're going, we're gonna worry about everything else then. I'll be home soon with Seanie. Tommy. You're scaring the hell out of me. I know. It'll be okay. Just do what I'm asking you. No, that's good... TOMMY: Out of the car, Sean! Let's go! Who's that? That's my brother. No wonder you won't answer his calls. What's going on? Why haven't you gone home? Kevin's been leaving messages for you all day. I didn't check them yet. Sean, everything all right? Can you just excuse us for a minute? Yeah. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) Dokey's coming after us. Why, what happened? Doesn't matter. Say goodbye to your girlfriend. We're going home and getting packed. Packed? We're leaving town. All of us. Ma, too. No way. All right, look, no way I'm leaving now, Tommy. You guys go, I'm staying. Remember how you got to ICU? It's going there again, Sean. We can't stop it. Okay, I don't care, all right? Dokey don't scare me. He'll scare her. You know Dokey. He won't stop at anything, Sean. I love her, Tommy. I wanna marry this girl. You love her? You wanna protect her? Yeah. Of course. Say goodbye. Don't tell her anything, just say goodbye. You don't know what you're asking, Tommy. She's gonna hate me. He looks pissed. You missed a shift at the bar or something? Yeah, something like that. Well, I'm late for work anyway. You know, that thing you told me before, I think it's really cool. Thanks. Seanie... Don't even say anything. Let's just go. Hey, what if he doesn't ask us to wait by the pool? Has he ever not asked us to wait by the pool? No. But it's never been cold like it is today. My gonads feel like there's only one of them. That ever happen to you? By the pool. RAY: This way, ladies. NICKY: Hey, be nice, Ray, I'm a comer. You're a scumbag. That's not what my friends tell me. You mean that friend there? The one that stood by while I played the bongos on your head with a shovel? They did have a gun to my head. Joey! What? Stop with the jumping. I always get jumpy when people are trying to kill me. I gotta tell you, Jimmy, I don't know about this plan. You haven't even heard it yet. Yeah. But anything with grenades and me is a poor plan. I mean, inexperience is bound to be a factor, mistakes could be made... (EXCLAIMING) Should we throw the grenades now, Jimmy? Should we throw them now? What should we do? What about now? Should we throw them? Is this the time? Should we throw them now? Would you shut up? Do you see Dokey? I don't see him. Where do you think they're all going? Hey, Dokey, I'm thinking having all these guys in the same room might not be the safest idea. I'm telling you, Jackie's the only one we can trust. Then thank God for Jackie, huh? (CELL PHONE RINGING) What? Jimmy, it's Tommy. I'm a little busy right now, Tommy. Me, Mom, Kevin and Sean are leaving. If you wanna come, get home. You running away? Yeah. Call it what you want. We're getting out of town, Jimmy. Tommy, say goodbye to Ma for me. And tell her I said you're a coward. JOEY. You might wonder where Jimmy learned the ropes when it came to stealing cars. Nice one, Jimmy. Losing Dad's keys. I didn't lose them, all right? Really? Then why are we standing out here on the sidewalk like a bunch of losers? Hey, guys, watch this. It might come in handy someday. Nice, Bobby. Show the kids how to rob a car. I'm talking survival skills here, Helen. Yeah, right. (ENGINE SPUTTERING) KEVIN: Does this mean we're not going to Bear Mountain? JOEY. That was the Donnellys. They could never make it more than a block out of the neighborhood. What are you doing? It's a cold dance. It keeps me warm. Stop it. How's it going? Hey, never mind how's it going. What do you know about Dokey's problem with this Donnelly kid? I saw it coming. That's why I've been building a relationship with Tommy Donnelly. You saw it coming? I'm telling you, this kid's got balls, okay? He's smarter than Dokey, and if he comes out on top, I'm telling you, he's gonna be a lot easier for us to work with. That's good. So whoever comes out on top, you're gonna keep it simple, and you're gonna keep it quiet. I'll make sure of it. Come on, sit down. Get these guys a couple of drinks. You want me to make them drinks? Isn't that what I just asked you? Where's your hospitality? I usually save it for a better class of people. Oh, he's driving. I'd love one. ALO: You know, at some point, you two nitwits are gonna have to start getting along. You, I'd like to throw in the pool. Salud. So, tell me about this Donnelly kid. Tommy, I am not leaving the East Coast, I would rather be dead. Ma... Just tell me, what are we taking? A plane, a bus, what? Ma, I said you don't need anything but the essentials. These are the essentials. This is my whole life we're talking about here. And you can't tell me when we're coming back, isn't that right? Isn't that what you said? You wanna stay Ma? I'm with you. We should stay here... Sean, stop. Kevin, one bag, that's all you get. Go back in and repack. She has more. Repack. Repack. Okay, I'm gonna be back in an hour. Don't let anybody in the house. What do you mean? Where are you going? Suitcases, Ma. Only suitcases. No boxes or it's not coming. Wait a minute, Tommy, where you going? We need a bigger car, Ma. Come on, Sean. Up. Give me a hand, you've been sitting there all day. I'm thinking we just throw the grenades from here. I'm thinking that's a long way, Jimmy. They'll probably go off in the air before they even get there. Hey, Leo. Sharkey, Philly, come here for me, will you? Earl tried to call you guys this morning. Not one of you picked up. Why? I don't know about these guys, but my battery was out. When I got it recharged, I called you, Doke. Oh. Well, I really appreciate you guys coming, you know? Good. What are you doing? Anybody else got a problem with their battery? I suggest you get it fixed now. Understand? We gotta get closer. That's not exactly what I was thinking. I'm telling you, man. You better watch your ass. This Nicky's gonna make a move. Will you stop already? When I want him dead, he'll be dead. All due respect, you're making a big mistake. Now what did I just... I need to go to the hospital. I'm gonna die. Remember when Nicky told Vinnie to get that thing? Well, the thing in question was a bottle of methanol. Which happens to be deadly when ingested in sufficient quantities. And Alo was about to get a sufficient quantity in his next martini. Hey. Suppose he offers us a drink? He won't. When has he ever? Get these guys a couple of drinks. JOEY. Now, Nicky having a drink with Alo still wasn't the problem you might expect, as long as Vinnie got Nicky to the hospital in time, something Ray wouldn't be able to do for Alo. Just drive the car. I'm moving! JOEY. Of course, with Vinnie behind the wheel, it was pretty touch and go for Nicky, too. Just drive the car! I'm moving! I'm driving! Let go of the wheel! (TIRES SQUEALING) Hey. We're leaving. Me, my brothers, Ma, all of us. I don't think we're coming back. This is because of what happened with Dokey? Yeah. But it's more than that. It's everything that's been going on. I'm changing it. That's good. I want you to come with me. Come with you? Yeah. Tommy, I can't do that. Listen, if this is about Samson, we'll put it all behind us. If you're worried about your dad, he can come with us. We can work this out. No. I love you. And if there's any part of you that still loves me... Tommy. Don't answer me now, okay? I'm gonna go back and get my mom and my brothers. The last thing I'm gonna do is call you. Tell me then if you can come. Let's go. Is everybody ready to go? Sean, get on your feet. Where's Kevin? In his room. Kevin? Come on! Kevin. TOMMY: Let's go. KEVIN: Go down, I'll be right there. Come on, Kevin. Give me two seconds. Come on! Ma? Yeah? Let's go. Yeah, yeah. Come on. Come on, Kev, let's go. Okay, I'm ready! Come on. Come on. What the hell is that? Where's my car? I sold it. You're the proud owner of this van, Seanie. Are you kidding me? Is this ours? TOMMY: We needed room for Ma's essentials. Road trip, yeah. Where's Jimmy? I hate this car. No, it's not a car, it's a passenger van. Kevin, Sean! Pile in. Where's your brother Jimmy? Come on, let's go. Sean, in the back. Oh, it's my van? I'm driving. Jimmy's not coming. What are you talking about, he's not coming? I tried everything, he won't come. You think I'm gonna leave my son behind? Okay, we're not going. Ma. We gotta go. You want me to go through with this? I leave with an entire family. Otherwise, you can just forget it. All right, when that guy's not looking, we're gonna run behind the SUV. You ready? Not really. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? TOMMY. Where are you? We're down at the old warehouse on Gilbert, Tommy. Let me talk to Jimmy. Where you calling from, Tommy? Oshkosh? I'm here with Ma. She won't go without you. Good, then maybe me calling you a coward worked. Can't talk right now, Tommy. I'm about to go kill Dokey. Okay. He'll come, we just have to do him a favor first. Okay. We're running from the mob in a passenger van? How great is that. JIMMY. Hello? Jimmy, hey! It's Joanie. I'm with your family. Did Tommy talk you into this? No, it... Jimmy, I think this is a good idea. It's a stupid idea, Joanie. It's what we've always wanted. What? Dodging nothing? Scared of a donkey-face like Dokey? We should go, because if you don't go, then I can't go. Jimmy? Hello? I'm really gonna miss her. He's such a jerk. Hold on. Do you wanna come? Really? Come on. We're still too far away. Out. Everybody out. Let's go! You too, Sean, let's go. Stay away from the windows. Lock the door, don't let anybody else in. I'll be back in 20 minutes with Jimmy, okay? KEVIN: Tommy! What? I think I should go with you. Take care of Ma. And lock the door, Kevin. All right, I'm gonna shoot that guy. When I do, I want you to run to the dock and throw the grenade. You make sure it lands right next to Dokey. And that would've worked out great except for one little detail. Can't I shoot the guy and you throw the grenade? Why? Cause I'm a lefty. We're gonna be running left, which means I'm gonna have to throw with my right. I can't do that, I'll get all twisted. All right. You shoot the guy, I'll throw the grenade. You ready? Yeah. One, two, three, go! JOEY. And that would have worked out great, too. Except some idiot hadn't realized the grenades were minus the explosive part. (MEN SHOUTING) What did work great was the part we didn't expect. Get in! JOEY: Drive, drive, drive, drive! JIMMY: Tommy, where the hell did you get this piece of crap? TOMMY: You're welcome, Jimmy. I'm going upstairs for a bit, hon. Gotta take a nap. Your dad's feeling a little dizzy. You know what? I think I'm gonna go up, sit with him for a while, see how he is. You get the hell out of here. Right now. Oh, I could do that. Or I could go up to your room instead, wait for you. I'm calling the police. Go ahead, call the police. I promise your dad will be dead before they get here. JOANIE: I don't understand, Jimmy. What's so great about this life? I like the life I got. Oh, you're so full of it, you get me sick. What do you like? You like being a junkie, huh? You like beating people up and stealing from them? What's to like about that? That's a little harsh, all right? Would you stop with the dramatics? You've got the nicest mom I ever met. I hate being a junkie, man. I wanna be a part of a family! I want a chance at something! What about my sign? I just bought that, what am I gonna do with that? Your sign? Who cares about your sign? You'll get another sign. Means I have to buy a whole new bar. Okay, so we'll get another bar. Wherever we're going, there's gonna be a bar. There's bars all over America, Jimmy! Come on! Look at me! I want my pretty hair back. I want my teeth. Come on... You coming? JOANIE: Please. Okay, what the hell? (SOBBING) TOMMY: Give me a second, all right, guys? God! (SAMSON GRUNTING) (PHONE RINGING) You coming? Yeah. You gonna call your grandma? I already did. Okay. Oh, my God! It's okay, Ma. Stay in the van. Tommy, where are you going? Get back in the van, I'm going to talk to Dokey. Yeah, right. Why don't I give you my gun so you can blow yourself away right now? I'm just going over to talk to Dokey. But it's up to you to get Mom and everybody out of here. I don't know how you're gonna do it, but I know you will. Just do whatever you gotta do. Okay? Tommy. No guns. That's a good thing, Tommy. Dokey. Tell me what you want. I'll give it to you. I'm yours. I can work for you, I'm smart. You know that. You name it, I'll do it. Or you can kill me. Just let my family go. Tommy, what makes you think I want anything from you, huh? I'm just trying to make sense of this. Make sense? Looks to me like you're running away. But you wanna save your family, huh? Whatever it takes. Okay, answer a question for me. Name it. Did you kill my brother? Let them go and I'll answer that. You're not making the rules, Tommy. Answer the question. And I'll let you go. All right. Yeah. I killed Huey and Sal. They were gonna kill Jimmy. Okay, go. Not me, them. No, I'm a man of my word. Go. You go. Go! Hey, Tommy. I want you to watch this. Ma! Oh, my God! Get in the van! Tommy! Go! Go! Come on! (TIRES SQUEALING) Come on! Drive! Mom! Mom! Drive, Seanie! That was the Donnellys.
