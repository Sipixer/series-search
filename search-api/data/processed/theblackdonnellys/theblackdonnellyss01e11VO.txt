Remember that delivery guy, Samson? He won't take a hint. But you've gotta leave, right now. Crybaby. Little Jimmy had something to cry about. He never found out which Italians killed his dad. But the Donnellys had other worries, like Dokey, who wanted them dead. Until they made him a deal. Now Dokey's asking favors, like helping his friend get rid of some squatters. He said he was trying to fix the building up. You know, we're trying to fix the building up. But the squatters had other ideas. It's piss! JOEY. Of course, they had to go. Whitey wanted to leave town, too. They got drugs in Des Moines. We could have a future together. He didn't get as far as he hoped. Too bad. I kind of liked him. I tell you to do a simple job. This is how you deal with it? You son of a bitch. You used us. I used you? Here's your money. If it's okay with you, I never wanna see you again. JOEY. Tommy knew right then and there he had a lot to learn if he was ever gonna run the four blocks he got from Dokey. THOMAS. Okay. Joey, stop right there. The thing you have to remember is that this is a grand jury you're going in front of. If you lie, you perjure yourself. Oh, well, gee, that could get me in all kinds of trouble, couldn't it? If you think I'm gonna let you take an oath and then testify that the Donnelly brothers' entire enterprise consisted of a four-block radius, then it's time for you to get... What number lawyer am I? (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry, Joey, I missed the funny part. Enterprise. Oh, you guys talk like it was some kind of big corporation. It wasn't like that at all. We were just a bunch of kids hanging out in a bar. At least, that's how it started. You got a visitor. TOMMY: What the hell's he doing here? Wish I knew. He won't talk to me. He wouldn't talk to me, either. Tommy liked to pretend he didn't know why people were always coming to him for help. Of course he knew. He was Bobby Donnelly's son. Here. JOEY. There was no escaping it. You're a saint, Bobby. I don't know what to say. I'm embarrassed. Hey, forget it. Look, I'll get you an extra day or two a week. You pay me back, all right? Okay, come on. Kevin said you were looking for me? I never liked you. I never liked your whole family. Great. And the longer I sit here waiting to ask you what I came to ask you, the more I hate you. You know what, Mr. Reilly, all I've done is bend over backwards, kissing your ass, trying to make you happy. You don't like me. I don't like you. Good. Sit down. I want to make you a partner with me in my diner. Excuse me? Here. Read that. "This building has been deemed structurally unsound. "Prepare to vacate the premise subject..." This is for the diner? That's why I need your help. I called everybody. Mortgage company says call the Buildings Department. They say call the mortgage company. Now, I think what you need to do now is call a lawyer. What good is a lawyer gonna be against Dokey? Dokey? That son of a bitch is behind this. Tried to buy me out. I wouldn't sell. Now he's gonna take it this way. Hey, you! You wanna listen, come sit down. Otherwise, get the hell away from here. I wasn't listening. Stop lying. I've known you your whole life. Fix this for me. Don't let them take my diner. Fix it and I'll give you half. Okay. Give me this notice and the name and the address of your mortgage company. But you're not giving me half your diner. The hell I'm not. The last thing I want is charity from the likes of you. And my Jenny doesn't know anything about this. And I wanna keep it that way. You're welcome, Mr. Reilly. Happy to help. (GUNSHO TS) KEVIN: Reilly says Dokey's behind this? Why don't we go straight to Dokey? TOMMY: Sure. Let's go to Dokey, Kevin. And he'll say, "Are you guys with me or aren't you?" We'll say, "No, we're with Reilly." Is that the conversation you wanna have? Besides, think about it. Dokey has us clean out a building for Lambert, Lambert burns down the building, now Reilly's building gets condemned. Gee, let me think, is there a connection here? So we're gonna threaten Lambert, make him tell us everything? No. We're gonna ask him first. (GROANS) (GROANS) JO ANIE. Hello? Hey, it's me. Jimmy! I'm at Whitey's. What? You mind popping over here? I need you, babe. Yeah, sure, Jimmy, I'll just pop over, with the cops all over this place... Don't argue with me right now. And bring something with you. What? This ain't straight thinking, Jimmy. (CLOSES PHONE) Hey, Whitey! You okay? Lambert's office was here yesterday, right? We'll go to this Full City Mortgage Company, and find out who's behind this. Then what? Then we're gonna put a stop to it. Their office is on 40 Worth Street. Where's Worth Street? Worth. That way. Yeah, one block away. Come on. KEVIN: It's the same building. Yep. It's on the first floor. Come on. Excuse me. I think maybe we're in the wrong place. Is this Full City Mortgage? This is our message service. So there's no one here in person that we can talk to? So let me guess, he's the smart one. Just tell us where the main office is. To what? Full City Mortgage. I have no idea. Hey, what are you being so bitchy about? We're just asking you questions. Listen, dunce... What'd you call me? You heard me. We handle 75 different companies, Full City is just one of them. Here. Leave your name and number and I'll give them the message. Which is my job, to take a message. Okay, thanks. Here is my cell phone number. If you need that, too. Why would you do that? Why would you give that human hate machine your phone number? I really liked her. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) (DOOR OPENING) JOANIE: (SCREAMING) Jimmy! What? What the hell? Damn it! Is he dead? (SHUSHING) Keep your voice down. Is he dead? What's wrong with you? Keep your voice down, I got a headache. Jimmy, did you kill him? Hey, did you bring the stuff? Oh, my God. My God... Joanie, would you shut up? He pulled a knife on me! Oh, my God! Joanie, get yourself together, I swear to God! Okay, okay, I'm together! Wait a minute. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? You called me! Yeah, I did, but the door was locked. How'd you get in here? Whitey gave me a set of keys. He gave you a set of keys. Why would he do that? In case I ever needed something. That's real generous of him. How many times you need something? (KICKS BODY) Go to hell, Jimmy. You're my girl. Nobody else's. Yeah? Well, you don't act like it. What do you want me to do? Huh? You want me to buy you flowers? (SCOFFS) (GROANS) I can't, Jimmy, not with him looking at me. He's not looking at you. Plus he's dead. He can't see anything. Forget it, I'm not doing it! Wait right there. Okay? Okay. We gotta find this guy, Lino. The engineer who signed off on this. (CELL PHONE RINGS) Yeah? Joey for you. What? You got a visitor. Dokey. The good news is he doesn't have an axe with him. 30% of 10 grand. There it is. I want you to know I got an extra 10 from Lambert. But you don't get a piece of that because you weren't square with us. When wasn't I square with you? You gave us a piece of work to clear out a building, but you never told us you were gonna burn it down. I say that's not square. I say it's none of your business. I say that makes for a tough partnership. Oh, so now we're partners? I see. Let's you and I go downstairs and talk for a minute, all right? Sure. Who the hell are you to accuse me of setting fires? You go down to those offices, you're talking to people. You're trying to help Reilly out, aren't you? See, you think I wouldn't know about that, did you? Reilly's a friend. He's gonna lose the diner. I'm trying to help him. What's that to you, Dokey? You know, you are just like your father. Excuse me? You ask too many questions. You wanna die like him? Huh? On the ground, being beat to a pulp until your heart stops? If the answer is no, Tommy, then stop going down and talking to people about anything, about real estate... Stop. Dokey? What? What's my father got to do with any of this? Nothing. I'm just trying to make a point. And I hope I made it. He doesn't want us helping Reilly. Good. Because I'm thinking helping Reilly's a bad idea. I'm thinking we need to talk to somebody who works for the city. What happened to the part about not helping Reilly? We're helping him. Well, we could always go to Jonesy. I mean, he used to work for the Buildings Department before he got caught glomming stucco for his new house. And you're telling me this now? I still kind of owe him some money. How much? Two grand. I mean, you wouldn't believe how uptight he is about it. You know, if you had just talked to me, it wouldn't have to be like this. Samson... You came into my home, you kissed me. You know, when I kiss somebody, that means something. My Dad's inside. Good! Let's tell him what a slut you are, huh? Tell him what you did to me that night. Samson, I'm gonna go in now. I trusted you. And you lied to me. I didn't lie to you. I told you it was a mistake. Mistake? I'm gonna give you one more chance. But you better learn the lesson. I'll call you later? And now you're counting it? You know what? Give it back to me. I can't... I can't wait until you owe me money for 11 months and see how you like it. Kevin! So what do you wanna know? The number on here for the Buildings Department? It says call for inquiries. We called, got a recording. It's the city, what do you expect? So how do we get in to talk to somebody about this? JONESY: Oh, that's a good one. What? Is it a fake? Yeah, the notice is real. The engineer is a fake. This guy, Anthony Lino, Chief Engineer? Got his degree from Wiseguy U. He wouldn't know a blueprint from a ham sandwich. It's a good bet that this notice was bought and paid for. I'd go see Franny Kenny down at the Buildings Department. He might be able to tell you what's going on. Franny Kenny? He was friends with your old man. They told me you were in the back. I hope I'm not interrupting. I don't want to get you in any trouble. No, no, no, it's okay. It's pretty slow in here today and even if it wasn't... And I wanted to give you this. It's a mix of my favorite songs. MAN: Pretty lame, dude. Giving a homemade mix to a girl that works in a jukebox store? You got no game at all. You've got great game. Thank you. Well, listen, I'll let you get back to work. Oh, okay. Well, thanks. Hey, would you wanna hang out sometime? I'd love that. I get off early. Okay. All right, great. Oh, I have to work. But you know what? Do you wanna just stop by the Firecracker? I'll be there. (R AND B MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Your boss just bought up these two properties. In Irish territory? Trevor's about to fix the zoning laws so that the walk-ups there now can be turned into high-rises. That could be worth millions. So you're telling me that this is the business that Trevor's got going on with Alo and Dokey? Isn't that what you asked for? You're a doll. Hey, baby. Meet Trish. Trish, this is Corey. Okay. So we're finished? Yeah. Great, now we know it's about real estate. Big deal. Vinnie, if I had to depend on your nose for the truth, me and you would be in a lot of trouble. Okay, what did I miss? Whatever Dokey and Alo got going on together, it's about more than this. You understand? So then she lied to us. No, no, no, she gave us everything we needed. She just doesn't know it. Bobby Donnelly's boys. I haven't seen you since you were still dropping a load in your diapers. (CHUCKLES) Which one are you, Jimmy? No, Tommy. How about you? Sean, right? 0-for-2. Kevin. You're little Kevin. I bought you a fire truck when... No, no, that was you. You, I bought a little horse because your father said you were lucky. Yeah, I think I still have that somewhere. How's your mother? Good. Good. That's good. She had a hard go there for a while. What can I do for you boys? Anthony Lino was the engineer. Let me guess, somebody's getting screwed. The past 12 years, the city's put everything on computers. But there's always a hard copy filed away. You can't trace a search on a hard copy. You never know who's checking it, right, boys? (CHUCKLING) (KEVIN CHUCKLES) What are you laughing at? I don't know. He's laughing, I'm laughing. Looks like Lino's condemned nine other buildings in the neighborhood in the past six months. Nine? That's what I said. So how do we find Lino? Lino can't help you. He'll just call his buddies and you'll be into a whole world of hurt. No. We gotta go after the legit guys, the ones who have paid Lino off. Now, we have to find out who really owns these buildings. Reilly owns his building. Whoever holds the mortgage owns the buildings. Now, we find out who they are, you tell them you're gonna publicize the fact that nine other buildings in the neighborhood have received phony condemnation notices. You say "newspapers," they'll give you anything you want. See, okay, Grand Limited. Now they've been sold to... Safety Net Limited. All right. FRANNY: K Boyle Limited now owned by Tomorrow Ventures. Tall Pines now owned by Green and Green Incorporated, now owned by Miller Road Development. Okay. Let's see what this gives us. Sorry, boys. It's the end of the line. What about this Longdale Properties? Where does that lead? You'd spend months tracking those guys down. But I can't help you. No, we're done here, boys. C'est la vie. What the hell's that mean? It's French for "We're screwed." That's what you're telling us, right? Was he better looking than me? Only in some places. Which places? Not that, you jerk. He had nicer teeth than you. Oh, my God, that's it! What? His teeth. That's how we'll get rid of him. You hammer out his teeth, you cut off his hands, we could dump him anywhere. They can't identify him. "Hammer out his teeth"? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. I can't believe you just said that. So who you been dealing with at Full City Mortgage? Nobody. I got the loan from my bank 30 years ago. (PHONE RINGING) Reilly's Diner. Hello? Hello? Anyway, about six months ago I got a letter telling me to pay that company, Full City. But I never talked to anybody, not like a real person. You never talked to anybody at the company? Didn't I just say that? I sent them checks, that's all I know! Why are you yelling at us? We're helping you. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? What? Ma, slow down. Ma... I'm gonna keep digging. Tommy, Ma wants us home. She sounds really upset. Was that Tommy? Yeah. What did he want? Nothing. (PHONE RINGING) Reilly's Diner. Hello? Who is this? Damn! It's been happening all day. NICKY: You remember this place? This is where you let Ray hit me in the head with a shovel. Don't even think about it, Vinnie! Yeah. But they had a gun to my head. Yeah, yeah. But I'm telling you, a 10-year peace between Alo and Huey couldn't hold for something this small. Considering Alo hates the Irish as much as we do, I agree. I'm telling you, it's gotta be something bigger. Okay. What? Look at this. That's those two buildings right there. VINNIE: Yeah, those are the two buildings that are going high-rise. Yeah, I know, except you remember what Alo said? Where are you? (GRUNTS) Tell me what this place is. He's making a point. Not only is he buying those two walk-ups, he's buying the ground we're standing on. And how much you wanna bet he's buying a whole bunch of lots from here to there? Son of a bitch! What the hell for? This neighborhood's been dead like 100 years. It'll never happen. A whole lot is happening. And you know what? He's getting a piece of it. And whatever it is, Trevor and Dokey are getting a cut, too. The only reason why we don't know about it is because we're out. If we're out, we're dead, right? Vinnie, we were dead 10 minutes ago. Now Alo's dead. Jimmy, Ma's been calling you, I've been calling you, where are you? It's important. Okay. I wanted to do this with the three of you, but... Ma! What is it? What are you trying to do for Jenny's father? I know you like the girl, but what kind of trouble are you getting yourselves into? They condemned the man's building for no good reason. We're trying to help. What's the problem? The problem is it's none of your business. What are you talking to Franny Kenny about? Did he call you? What's wrong with Franny Kenny? I thought he was a friend of Dad's. Just answer my question. About what? Reilly's building? Can someone tell me what's going on? Okay. You go to your room. Ma, you can't tell me to go to my room. Now. God help you if Sean's been pulled into any of this. Ma, what is it you're so worried about? And who is Franny Kenny anyway? Franny Kenny is nobody, he's a hanger-on. Kissed Huey Farrell's ass his entire life till Huey kicked him out the day after your father died. This isn't about him. It's about you and your brothers stopping whatever it is you're doing. We're helping Jenny and her father. We're not stopping. Open it. There's more. Look at them all. I went and got these so I'd never forget what they did to your father. Why'd you show me these? Because I'm so afraid that the same thing is gonna happen to you and your brothers if you don't leave this thing alone. Tommy, do not ask another question about any of this. I'm asking you to do that. I expect it to happen. What happened? Where you going? I'm going to Reilly's. Dropping this thing. Franny Kenny? God, it's been years since I've heard that name. TOMMY: Is he a good guy? He worked for Huey at the union. We'd have dinner once in a while. But I never really knew him. TOMMY: What'd he do for Huey? I don't know what his official title was. But whenever it came to money or handling money, he was the go-to guy, or at least that's what Huey called him. So they had a falling out? Huey had a falling out with everybody at one point or another. This is after my dad died, right? Yeah, I guess it was around there. Why you asking all these questions? Kevin and I are trying to find out who owns this building that's being condemned. Franny said he could help, but then he said he couldn't. You're talking about a building in the neighborhood. Yeah. Well, that's crap. Pick a building, Franny could tell you who owns it, when they bought it, who they bought it from, and how much they cheated the previous owner out of. At least he could when I knew him. What if we made it look like a suicide? How we gonna do that? We slice up his wrists and when that didn't work, he started stabbing himself. I would believe that. Yeah, but nobody else would. Well, we're gonna have to deal with this. I am dealing with it. This is how I do my best thinking. Hold on! You know what we should do? We should put him on the subway. Let him ride around and... Take them weeks before they figure out who he was. How we gonna get him to the subway? I don't know. Put a sheet over him and carry him downstairs. What if we meet somebody on the stairs? Or in the 10 blocks to get to the subway? Maybe we could fit him in the garbage chute. It's a three-story building. There's no garbage chute. Use your head. Well, I don't see you coming up with any suggestions. Maybe we could use your old standby and throw him out the window. That's not a bad idea. You might notice I've never been arrested for that. WOMAN ON TV. No! Leave me alone! SEAN: So you like working there? At the store? I get to listen to my favorite bands all day. And it's making me the money I need to go to music school. I hate school, but music school? That sounds fun, not like a real school. Twentieth Century Techniques, History of Opera, Equal Interval Orchestration and Advanced Instrumental Reading Lab, and that's just my first quarter. That's brutal. I'd rather go to real school. My dad taught me to play guitar when I was little. I've been hooked ever since. He died about a year ago. Heart attack. Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. It's a lot harder on my mom than it is on me. I loved my dad more than anything, but I hate to see her alone. I want her to find someone. I know, I lost my dad a long time ago. It gets easier. Really? So your mom's okay now? Oh, yeah. She married again? No. But she found someone. No. What happened to your dad? My mom told me he choked on a peanut butter sandwich. I wanted to believe her for a really long time. I mean, he went to lunch one day and never came back. But I knew it wasn't true. Come on, what kind of restaurant sells peanut butter sandwiches? He was murdered. Now, people don't wanna say what really happened, but I believe my brother Jimmy. He says that my dad died because he wouldn't back down to a bunch of greaseball Italians, so they beat him to death. I'm Greek. Oh. Good. Hey. Can we talk for a second? I call you, you hang up on me. I call back, you don't even have the courtesy to pick up the phone, but now you wanna talk? Samson, I know I hurt you, okay? I accept responsibility for that. Love is not a one-way street. Love, Samson? We had sex. Once. Okay? I was drunk. I'm sorry. I really am. I'm sorry I took advantage of you. It was wrong, it was selfish, and I know that. (INAUDIBLE) Oh, you know what? To hell with that. You wanna hurt me? Try it. But whatever I need to do to protect myself, I'll do it. I promise you that. I will hurt you right back. I never knew you were so tough. I guess one of us will have to be looking over their shoulder, huh? Yeah, you. KEVIN: Why you making me do this, huh? Why don't you just talk to me? (FRANNY GROANING) Kevin, what are you doing? Hey, Tommy. Huh? What are you doing? You okay? Nice way to treat somebody who tried to help you. (GRUNTS) Don't lie to us, all right? You never tried to help anybody! Stop with the smacking! Look, Ma's been hiding something from us, all right? And it has something to do with this guy. How do you know that? Because I'm a gambler. I may not be lucky, but I'm good, all right? I know people's tells. I saw Mom's when we asked her about him. She ran her hand through her hair twice. Since we were kids she's been doing that. She doesn't do it when it's a lie. She does it more when she's avoiding a lie. And it has something to do with this guy. That's why I'm beating the crap out of him. I know he lied to us earlier. I just don't know what he lied about. Okay. Just follow my lead. All right? No more lies. Or he's really gonna hurt you. You can hurt me all you want. But what you boys don't understand is I'm trying to help you. Hit him. (GASPS) Who owns Reilly's building? I know you know. I don't. Kevin. (GRUNTS) (MOANS) Corporations, like I said! You said it went on and on. In a circle. That it doesn't stop. But it does, doesn't it? I wanna know where. It doesn't go on and on. It stops with Longdale Properties. Who's behind Longdale? I want names! The people that we're gonna threaten with going to the papers, that's what you said, right? Huh? Wait! Wait. Wait. Huey Farrell. Probably Dokey now, and Al. Al Onotaro. And me, once upon a time. That's Longdale Properties. The Italians and the Irish together? Yeah. Why? The land, real estate money... Everybody forgives for money. My father, was he a part of it? Was he a part of this land deal? Of course he was. Huey and he were partners with everything. But your father was against this deal. He hated the fact that the Italians were buying up land in the neighborhood. He told Huey he wouldn't have any part of this. Is that why my father was killed? Yes. Who did it? I don't know. You're a liar! Who did it? Who did it? I wanna know who punched him. I wanna know who kicked him. I want names! I didn't know. The only thing I know is your father asked me to meet him at the diner that day. I was late, he was dead when I got there. JOEY. Tommy wanted to stop. He knew whatever he was gonna find out was gonna be something that he couldn't bear. An unimaginable hurt. And yet, he didn't stop. (SHOUTS) You let him go down there alone 'cause you knew they were gonna kill him! I didn't know, I swear to God I didn't know! Who did it? I don't know! You do know! Who? Come on! Who did it? Tommy Donnelly. Always getting me out in the night. This gonna be good? What's up? Man-to-man, I wanna know. Did Huey set up my dad? Are you hallucinating? Is Huey the reason my father's dead? Tommy, one time, it's hilarious. Don't forget I got an axe in the car, okay? I know everything. What do you know? I know that my dad and Huey were partners. And I know Huey was in bed with the Italians. I know it was all about land. And my father was against it. And that's why your son of a bitch brother let him get killed. My brother cried when your father died. We all did. We all loved him. Everyone thought they knew what happened to Bobby Donnelly that day. It had kind of become neighborhood legend. Sal? Thanks for meeting us, Bobby. We appreciate it. Sit. I don't need to sit, Sal. Huey can do whatever he wants. This is our neighborhood and it's our union. As far as I'm concerned, you're staying out. (MEN GRUNTING) But nobody really knew what happened. Thanks for taking the meet, Bobby, we appreciate it. You know what, guys? This is wrong. You do what you want, but I'm done here. Unfortunately for Bobby, Huey saw it coming. He knew that no amount of money could make Bobby betray the neighborhood. (BOBBY GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) JOEY. The Irish were renowned for taking care of their own. So to prove his loyalty to the Italians, Huey had to show them that he could kill his own. Huey was there that morning, okay? So he told me what happened. Could he have helped your father? Absolutely not. You know, I really don't hate you enough to tell you what happened, okay? But I will tell you this. You need to think about who gained by sending your father down there. Who sent your father down there, Tommy? How come you don't ask that question? Huh? You wanna know? Go ask your mother. What? Go home and ask your mother. This is really becoming a hassle. MAN ON TV. A guy comes home, okay? His best friend's in bed with his wife. He looks, he says, "Max, I have to. "But you?" I got a cousin in med school. Maybe he wants him. My head hurts. I need a breather. Give me that. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Who's this? Oh, hi, Frankie. Yeah. Uh, no. Yeah, Dad's already upstairs. No, everything's fine. All right, okay, thanks for calling. Bye. JOEY. Remember that unimaginable hurt I told you about? The thing that Tommy was gonna figure out he couldn't bear? HELEN: You've got a wife and four kids. You can't lose your job at the union. BOBBY: There are people in this neighborhood who depend on me, Helen. They've gotta feed their kids, too. Let the neighborhood take care of itself. You and Huey have come all this way together, you've worked too hard. Just worry about your own. Don't do this, Bobby. JOEY. If Tommy let himself remember what his mother said, he'd have to admit to himself that it was his mother who sent his father to the diner that day. It was his mother who forced Bobby Donnelly to take that meeting. How'd you do? No more Christmas presents from Franny. JIMMY: What's all this hullabaloo? Where the hell have you been? With his new squeeze. You wanna know where I've been, Ma? Only having probably the best day of my life. Really? Things are going so well with me and Joanie, it's fantastic. I think I'm in love. Oh, God. Hey, I got some news. I'm thinking about going back to school. If you thought there was a chance I was gonna let you do anything else, I don't know what world you're living in. I think we're saying the same thing. What the hell are you
