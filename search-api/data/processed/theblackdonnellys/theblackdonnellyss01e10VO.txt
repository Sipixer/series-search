What the hell am I lookin' for? Well, he went out for a walk but he never came back. And Samson, Jenny's one-night stand? He won't get lost. Neither will Nicky Cottero. Nicky wanted to make Tommy his partner but then Jimmy showed up. Sorry I'm late. That went over well. But Jimmy was always the level-headed one. Like with Bob the Mouth. You know, the guy with the waffle iron Jimmy owed money to? He learned his lesson. Speakin' of lessons, Sean's mom still wanted him to get an education. So he took up the family trade. (GROANING) But what he didn't know was, in this neighborhood, the higher you learn, the harder you fall. McCARTHY. Sit up. Sit up! And uncross your legs. What? Do I have to? Only if you don't wanna get a kick in the balls. Tell us about that first meeting with Dokey Farrell. Well, actually, that's the only meeting that they left me out of. But I was there for the first official meeting with the brothers themselves. Oh. Yeah. It all started when I was givin' the brothers a bit of advice. The perfect Orgasm is Bailey's on the bottom, peppermint schnapps on top. It's good, right? Huh? That didn't do anything for me. Give us a shot of tequila, would ya? All right. We're all gonna die. That's not a toast I'm familiar with, but what the hell. Nicky's gonna kill Dokey. And because I turned down the deal he offered us yesterday, Nicky's gonna kill us right after that. You turned it down? I told him if he couldn't work with you, he couldn't work with me. Okay. Let Nicky come, let him try. No, he's not gonna try, Jimmy, he's gonna do it. Unless we make ourselves a lot stronger than we are right now. Nicky's tryin' to kill us? I say we kill him and send a message. What message, Kevin? That we want the whole Italian mob after us? What we need to do is get Dokey on our side. Dokey? So we'll be able to use his money and his connections and his people. Then, we'll be strong enough to take on the Italians after they kill him. I like it. What I don't like is you acting like somebody I should listen to. You got a better idea, Jimmy, we'll do that. When I do, I'll let you know. Okay. So we go see Dokey today? Not you, Sean, you're out. What? No way, I'm with you. Jimmy, if Sean's in, we're not doin' this. Sean, you're out. Yeah, Sean, you're out. You guys are really gonna do this without me? Go home. You're still the beverage manager. I need you here in the morning to open up the bar. To hell with you, Jimmy. If I'm not a part of everything, I'm not a part of anything. Run your own damn bar. Joey, get us another round. That mean I'm stayin'? Just get the beers. It was the high point of my life. Excuse me? You just been invited to get together with a lot of people who are gonna kill a lot of other people and that's the high point of your life? You haven't seen the rest of my life. From now on, we only trust the people in this room. Tell me what else you've been doin'. Tell me everything. (GUNSHO TS) IAN: Hey. You done, you guys? Yeah. All right. Dad! Hey, babe. What are you talkin' about, "Hey, babe"? Where have you been? What are you, my mother now? Dad, you were gone all day and all night. Look at you, you're all sunburned. I went to Coney Island. I'll get the grill, you grab the counter. Coney... What were you doing in Coney Island? I'm dating the lady with the beard, okay? Can we get to work now? We got mouths to feed. So we went to deal with Dokey. And we told him how it was. I thought you said you weren't at that meeting? Well, no, it was Jimmy, Tommy and Kevin. I was doin' more important things. You know, I could use a hand here. (POURING WATER) TOMMY: I know Jimmy's acting crazy. He's extorting from everybody in the neighborhood, and he has no intention of stopping. That sound about right, Jimmy? Yeah, that sounds about right. So here's what I think we're gonna do. We keep Jimmy's business. And we carve out some territory of our own. Did you bring me down here to joke with me, is that what this is? Only the four blocks where we live. Let's face it, we have as much right to it as you do. You started doin' dope like your junkie brother? Huh? Give us one month. We'll double the action you got goin' now, and kick back 30%. Thirty percent? We don't deliver, you start swingin'. What about you two idiots? You gonna stay in line? Hell, yeah, Doke. Yeah. All right. I'll tell you what, I'll give you your first job. Got a friend downtown, has a building that needs clearing out. In your territory. Yeah. And you bring me back my 30%, we'll see how it goes. All right? Oh, one last thing. You guys hear anything about Bob Kelly? Bob the Mouth? I heard someone threw him off his balcony. That's what I heard. If you hear anything else, you let me know? Sure. We'll see how it goes. EARL: I don't know why we don't just kill them and get this over with. DOKEY: That's right. We'll whack the four of them, that'll make our councilman friend very happy, right? I'm just thinkin' the gimp. He's the only one with any balls. You know, if you would find Whitey like I asked you, that's the way we'll take care of Jimmy. Where's Whitey? We did Bob the Mouth together, Tommy. If he hurts me, he hurts himself. Give him some money. Tell him to get out of the city and never come back. Whitey's not gonna do that. Sure he is. Jimmy's gonna make him understand he has to. I can do that. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yo. Where's Whitey? He didn't come home last night, man. Who are you? Who are you? I'm his roomie, man. Since when? Um... He wasn't here when I got here, so I figured I could stay, you know? Is that cool? He gave you a key? Actually, the window was open. Get out of here. Leave that. No way, man. Leave it. (SPOON CLATTERING) (DOOR SLAMS) JOEY. The reason Nicky had tried to make a deal with Tommy was because Alo had recently made it clear that he wasn't gonna include Nicky in any of his future dealings. So, when Tommy didn't work out, Nicky moved on to a different kind of leverage. Trish Hughes turned out to be Councilman Trevor's chief of staff. You remember Trish, right? The redhead with the nice rack who had lunch with the councilman, Dokey and Alo? VINNIE: Hey, feel this. NICKY: I'm not touchin' you. Well, look at it. There's a bump. It's not a bump, it's a rash. You wanna put your shirt down? Just feel it. I swear, you ask me that one more time, I'm gonna shoot you in the mouth. She's got a brownstone like that on a secretary's salary? NICKY: She's the councilman's chief of staff. Still. Who is she to own a brownstone? And where did she get the dime to have a construction crew come and go? There you go, there you go. S & J. God is good. BUILDING MANAGER: We made fair deals with most of the tenants. But there's still some bad eggs left. Junkies, squatters, lowlifes. They took the money, now they don't wanna leave. TOMMY: What do you mean, "took the money"? We found them comparable housing, gave them a check to cover moving expenses, made the deal, now they're reneging. Here's a list. These people are all junkies? No. But they're all there illegally. We cut the cable, electricity, I still can't get them to go. What I need you to do is physically remove them from the property. You know, we're tryin' to fix the building up, bring good people into the neighborhood. How much? Ten grand. Twenty. Dokey said ten. Then get Dokey. Names and apartment numbers. And I want them out by tonight. I got one for ya. What's the difference between chopped beef and pea soup? You're not gonna tell that one again. I want to hear it. Everyone can chop beef, but not everyone can pee soup. All right. Here you go, my lads. What the hell's this? What? Fifteen years I'm comin' here, I never once ordered eggs and tomatoes. I hate eggs. I hate tomatoes. The only thing I hate worse is when they're together. Shut your mouth. Look at you. Beet red. Just crawlin' out of the sack. You're half in the bag. You son of a bitch! Dad! Are you out of your mind? (GROANS) Dad! What the hell's the matter with you? Dad! Stop! Dad! Crazy son of a bitch! I'll kill you! This is it. So how we gonna do this? I don't know, Kevin. I've never done this before. Let's just see what we're up against. What are you gettin' testy for? Testy, Kevin? Testy? We got two guys on the first floor. Let's start with 1 D. You gotta leave. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah? Your name Dunn? Yeah? We're from Highland Management. You were supposed to have vacated three weeks ago. I haven't found a place yet. Sorry, but you gotta be out today. Okay, um... Thanks. No. We're gonna wait until you go. Where the hell am I supposed to go? Not our problem. I'd use the money Highland Management gave me to get a new place. I spent that money. Better find yourself a sidewalk. Let me get my stuff. (TOMMY YELLING) Kevin, get back here! Kevin! (DOG BARKING THROUGH DOOR) Jimmy's crazy, man. I begged him not to steal from Dokey's people. Now they're chasin' after me! You're such a wussy. Listen to me. I'm getting' out of here. I'm goin' to Des Moines. Des Moines? Lowa. I got a second cousin there. I want you to come with me. Why would I wanna do that? What's wrong with Des Moines? It's not Des Moines, it's you. Whitey, I only did you for the drugs. I love you. Shut up. Besides, I love Jimmy. Why would you love Jimmy? I don't know. So come with me. No! They got drugs in Des Moines. We could have a future together. We are not... Don't answer it. Why not? MAN: Police! Open up! What do you want? We're lookin' for Terrence Whalen! Who the hell is that? That's me! Ask what it's about. What's this about? Just open the door! I'll call you. Okay. Nobody's pressing any charges, but your father's got a gash on his head, could use some stitches. Well, he won't go to the hospital. Well, just put a butterfly on it. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Um... He's been having some memory problems recently, he hasn't been himself. And, if you took him and told the doctors, they'd probably do a full exam, wouldn't they? (HORN HONKING) VINNIE: Hey, Joey, gone off the Atkins, I see. S & J's got a couple of crews in Greenwich, workin' on a brownstone. Who's footin' that bill? Not the redhead that's livin' in the brownstone, I can tell ya that much. Let me guess, our tax dollars hard at work. Yeah, it's a city job. Technically, those crews are workin' on that new high school goin' up on 10th. But hey, if they end up at a brownstone on Greenwich, who am I to argue? Thanks, Joey. Give your mother a kiss. Yeah, and your father a shot in the head. My whole life I wanted to do that. Here ya go. On the house, guys. That's three in a row. What's Jimmy gonna say when he finds out you're givin' away the store? Maybe I'll get lucky and he'll fire me. How you doin', Seanie? Phenomenal. Dog bites can be really bad. You're supposed to get that swilled out with a special water solution. You're supposed to get a rabies shot. Oh, don't do that. They hurt. Five pounds of top round. Oh, is The Firecracker gonna start servin' steak now? It's to get the dog out. Oh! Like bait. I get it, you're gonna put some drugs in it, knock the dog out. That'd be a great plan, if only we had drugs. How's it gonna work? Guys? You ready? No, we really ought to rethink this. Thought Joey was faster than that. Okay, buddy. Time to go. Okay, I'm going, get off my neck. Empty. Joey! Ground floor's clear. Second floor's next. Two more. Mitchell Carr in 2D and Beth Davies in 2A. I'll take Beth. Kevin, stay with Joey. I'll get Carr. What the hell was that? Boys better turn around. Whatever the hell you're after, it ain't gonna happen. We're comin' up. And we're gonna ask you all to leave peacefully. You don't have a right to be here. The hell we don't! Oh, my God. It's piss! The guy just urinated on me. You're dead, man! Go, go, go, go. Bad idea! Bad idea! Go! Bad idea! Bad idea! We done here? Any tenderness? The son of a bitch was choking me, you don't think there's gonna be a little tenderness? What's your name? Reilly. What's yours? Mike. Well, Mike, I'd like to go home now, please. Not quite yet. How about your daughter? What about her? What's her name? Jenny. Yeah? Why? You took a pretty good shot to the head. I just wanna make sure there's no trauma. What's your line of work? I run a diner. What's your best dish? Beef stroganoff. Either that or the meatloaf. What year is it? Mr. Reilly? You know what year it is? Oh, I get it. You want me to say it's 1863 and Lincoln is president, huh? IAN: Okay, we're done here. No, I still need to do a CAT scan... The hell you do. Playing your damn tricks. Dad. What? Nobody's playing any tricks. There's nothing wrong with me! Yes! There is! And we need to find out what it is. Please. A little honesty wouldn't hurt, fella. Hey. Hey! Samson, hi. Oh, my God, I heard what happened. I went by the diner. How's he doin'? He's... He's fine. It's going to be fine. They got you waitin', huh? Yeah, they're just runnin' some tests. Okay. Well, I'll stay. And make sure you're all right. No, we're fine. You should go back to work. Oh, no, it's okay. When I heard what happened, I took the rest of the day off. I'm all yours. Thanks, but it's okay. Jenny, your dad's hurt. Where else would I be but here? You know, Samson, I think I'd really rather be alone with my dad. Okay, then I'll check in with you later. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Yeah? Okay. I'll be right there, babe. Where'd they all go? They're all in their apartments. This is disgusting! I don't care if that guy's in a wheelchair, I'm breakin' his legs. You know, I should really be gettin' back to the bar. Sean's gonna miss me. I'll take Carr, you guys take 2A down the hall. Carr? I'm comin' in, okay? Let's talk about it. Carr? You want me out of here? Come get me. Somethin' tells me that wouldn't be too smart. Got that right. Don't forget to put the door back on your way out. I didn't say I was leaving. Look, the landlord's given you enough time to find a new space. Plus you took their money. You're not here legally. Guy like you, that should mean somethin'. DOKEY: Hey, Whitey. Whitey! Come on, wake up. How ya doin', buddy? Not so good. I want you to say hello to Detective Deckle. Hi. Bye. DOKEY: Did you see his face? Yeah. I want you to remember it, okay? Because he's going to the 18th right now. And when you get there... When I get there? When you get there, I want you to tell him that you saw Jimmy Donnelly throw Bob Kelly off the balcony, all right? God. I would love to help you, but that's crazy, you're talkin' crazy. Earl, do me a favor and open up his door. You know, you can go. Jimmy Donnelly's gonna kill you. What are you talkin' about, man? I didn't tell you anything. What do you think that junkie broad is doin' right now? Right now, she's probably tellin' Jimmy how the cops came in and dragged you out of her house. And you think Jimmy Donnelly trusts you not to say anything? This is really uncool. Yeah? Go on, get out of my car. Go. Let's go, Earl! Sure, I took that check. Then I saw what they were movin' me into. No ramps, no elevator. They were nice enough to put in shag carpets. Try rollin' around in one of these things on a shag carpet. I sent back their check. It's not my fault they didn't want it. You sent back their check? I look like somebody who enjoys repeatin' himself? You see that wheelchair access out front? Yeah. My friend and I built that. You see that kitchen? Those appliances? I custom-fit them myself. To tell you the truth, I'm too tired to do it again. Look, man... No, no, no, don't talk to me, okay? Just get out. I got my books here. I got a market a block away, a park where I play chess. This is me. Ain't nobody takin' it away from me. After tonight, you're gonna be the only one in here. No electricity, no water, no heat. It's been like that for a while. It's not a problem. You in the war? Iraq? What the hell do you care? You're a vet. Just shut up. Kevin burned his hand on a bottle rocket. Tommy, get some ice! Here we go. Have a seat, it's okay. Here, have a seat. Let's see. Okay, okay. It's just a burn. Tommy! Here you go. Now, just take the ice with the other hand, rub it around. Rub, rub, rub. That a boy. What the hell were you doin' with a bottle rocket? That's what Fourth of July's for, isn't it? What are those nuns teaching you guys? All right. Boys sit down, come on. Have a seat, everyone. Keep rubbin', keep rubbin', you're gonna be fine. So, people think the Fourth of July is about fireworks and hot dogs and block parties, huh? All I'm saying is, I wanna try to help you. What, because I'm a vet? I should kick your ass right now. Don't nobody care about me bein' no vet. I parked my Humvee in the wrong place, son of a bitch blew up. Now I'm just another cripple. Don't give me no patriotic crap, 'cause I don't wanna hear it. If somebody owed me somethin', I'd have had it already. Okay. If what you're tellin' me is true, if they didn't buy you out already, then I'll make sure they leave you alone. If not, then I guess I got a fight on my hands. Buddy, you try and come back in here, you're a dead man! Just understand that! I was just on my way to help. How'd it go with that maniac in the wheelchair? Leave him alone. Tell Kevin to clear out the rest. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) What took you so long to get here? What did the cops say? Did you get high? You bastard. You got high without me. Joanie, I'm gonna boot you all over this apartment if you don't tell me what they said. They didn't say anything. They just took him! Where? I don't know. Wait, they did say one thing. They asked Whitey about some guy, Bob something. Bob Kelly? Yeah. Oh, wait, no. Was that that guy, Bob the Mouth, you told me about? I told you about that? Yeah, we got high one night and you did a whole re-enactment. I never told you about that. Maybe Whitey did. What was he doin' here? Jimmy, Whitey's a skeevy little rat. He's gonna give you up! What was he doin' here, Joanie? He was gettin' high. And he was nice enough to give you some? What are you talkin' about, Jimmy? I hate Whitey. Yeah, right. When he gets back here, call me. Jimmy, wait. You keep him here. Jimmy, wait. Jimmy! You can at least do that, right? You told me they were all scumbags and squatters. This guy's a war vet in a wheelchair. He returned the check you sent him. I have no idea if he returned the check. If he did, I'll find out. The point is, you were gonna send him to a place where he couldn't live. Couldn't exist. He's in a wheelchair. I didn't know that. Nobody told me that. You tell me what the guy needs and I'll take care of it. You just get him out. Here's $500. That'll pay for a hotel for the night. You give me a list of the guy's needs, and I'll take care of it. I'll get him whatever he wants. MAN: That's it. Now it's gone on too long. He's owed me this money over a month, goin' on, you know, and every time I see him on the street, he acts like I never... He's been wantin' to pay me back... It's crazy, he's tryin' to make a jerk out of me. You know, I hate to do this over money. Okay, everybody out. I'm serious, drink up. Last call. Okay, never mind, don't drink up, I'm kickin' you out. What are you talkin' about? Last call is, like, nine hours from now. No more Firecracker today. Out. Thank you. Bye. Hi. Oh, hey. I know you. You sold me the jukebox. I wanted to bring you another CD package. Are you closin' up? No! No, no. No, come on in. Matter of fact, drinks are on the house today. Wow! The place looks great. Last time I was here, it didn't look like this. I did that. How you doin'? I'm Nicky Cottero. This is Vinnie. Hi. Give me a second. Your name is Trish Hughes. You're chief of staff to councilman Jack Trevor. You live on Greenwich. Pretty little brownstone, right? Where for a month you've had concrete crews from Local 19 and carpenters from Local 603 working. The fact that the city thinks that these workers are puttin' up a local high school might not be a good thing. I'm thinkin' five years. But more importantly than that, is all the ambition that you've got. That's all gone. Now, I'm gonna keep all that to myself, but I'm gonna need somethin' from you. Okay. Jack Trevor, Al Onataro, and Derek Farrell, they're all doin' business together. I wanna know what they're doin', when it started, where it's goin'. Meet me at the 40 Deuce club tomorrow, noon. Lunch is on me. Go to hell. I'm calling Trevor. Go ahead. Call him up. You know what? Invite him to the club tomorrow. But you better hope that he loves you one hell of a lot. 'Cause if he thinks that for a moment you're gonna give me what I want, you know what he's gonna do? He's gonna take you to a nice, romantic dinner by the seaside, where there's no sea, no side, just a hole in the ground that's waiting for you. I'm not giving you any information, so I've got nothing to worry about. Kiss your boyfriend goodbye. Enjoy your five years in the can for embezzlement. That was good. We'll see. Will you get out of here, please? Why? I can't go when you're lookin'. Tommy said to leave that guy alone. Look, I don't care what Tommy says. He did it to me, I'm doin' it to him. It's the principle of the thing! Joey! If you don't turn around right now, I'm gonna piss all over you. Thank you. Hey. IAN: Hear anything yet? No, I thought the doctor was still here. I'll go check. No, no. Don't bother. Come sit with me. I'm sorry I scared you yesterday. Just so you know, I am not dating that bearded lady. Kind of lost it for a while. It occurred to me... I'm on the D train. How the hell did that happen? And I look up and I'm at Coney Island. It's all different out there now from when your mother and I used to take you there. Remember The Twister? Oh, how you loved that. And the Cyclone. I went on that. And that arcade where they shoot the ducks and the... food emporium where they made that fudge. I did it all. Sometimes, I had you and your mother with me. I gotta go talk to the doctor, Dad, I'm... No. Why? We both know what it is. I've got Alzheimer's. I don't need a doctor to tell me that. Let's just go home. (KNOCKING) JIMMY: Hey, Whitey! It's Jimmy! (BANGING ON DOOR) Whitey, you awake? It's Jimmy, open up! (KNOCKING CONTINUES) Where the hell you been, man? We got problems. I got people chasin' after me, beatin' me up, all kinds of things. Joanie told me. Some cops got you, right? Yeah. Yeah. And you know what? They didn't get anything. What'd they ask about? Well, they asked about us killin' Bob. But I didn't say anything. I don't believe you. Oh. Look, man, I could have been gone already, right? Yeah. But I know why you're not. So what is it? Is this about Joanie? No. But I'd kill you for that, too. Wait, shouldn't one of us wait outside? You know, be a lookout? Come on. Over there. You wasted it. Damn! Now I gotta fill another one. Can you do that? We're gonna get you out, man! Son of a bitch! TOMMY: Kevin? Get off me! TOMMY: Joey? Get off! Kevin? Kevin? Kevin! Kevin! Carr, get off of him! Get off! I'm gonna help! Let go! JOEY. But it was too late. The soldier came out in Carr that night. He was in battle again. It was a fight to the death. Unfortunately, it was Kevin who he was killin'. (GRUNTING) Get off him! Kevin? Kevin? Kevin! Get up! Get him up. You all right? You're all right? Breathe. Breathe. Guys. Guys. Carr. He's not breathin'. Carr! Oh! Oh! Hey. Hi. So, how'd the tests go? You know what? I really don't wanna talk about it. It's my Dad, you know, it's private. Oh, okay. You know, you could have called. What? To let me know, you know. I've been worried. Samson... Thank you. Thanks for the concern, but... I really need to close up now. So... Why are you doing this to me? What did you say? Whatever I did, I'll change. Just tell me what to do. Samson, stop! If I ever made you feel the way I feel right now, I'd kill myself. Whatever it is that you've got goin' on right now, I can't help you. But you've gotta leave, right now. Bitch. You know the Goo Goo Dolls' Down on the corner? I hate the Goo Goo Dolls. Good. This is the original. (ROCK SONG PLAYING ON JUKEBOX) (SINGING) Early in the evening just about suppertime Over by the courthouse they're startin' to unwind Come on! Poor kids on the corner tryin' to bring you up Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp Down on the corner Out in the street Willy and the poor boys are playin' Bring a nickel, tap your feet I don't get it, Tommy. Guy did try to kill me. He was a soldier. He deserves at least as much. I don't mean to butt in... Then don't. ...but there's a procedure to this thing. Folding a flag, you do it wrong, it's un-American. That's why we're gonna do it right. Kevin, don't let it touch the ground, I know that's bad. Shut up, Joey, we all know that. Joey, flip your end over and give it to Kevin. Keep it tight. Then do it again. So that we get the stars on top. Let go, Joey. Kevin, with the closed end first, make a triangle. BOBBY: Third fold stands for justice. That's it, keep it comin'. What's the fourth fold mean? The fourth fold means perseverance. And the sixth stands for valor. The seventh for purity. The eighth for innocence. The ninth for sacrifice. And the twelfth... What does the twelfth fold mean again? Truth. JOEY. So what I wanna know is this. It's bad to let the flag touch the ground, but it's okay to put dirt on it? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute! What does this veteran have to do with Dokey Farrell and his deal with the Donnellys? I don't know. I told ya, I wasn't there.
