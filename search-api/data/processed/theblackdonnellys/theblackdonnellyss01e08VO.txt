who knew it was Tommy who ran over Jimmy's leg. But Tommy never let himself forget it. And he never stole a car again. The doctor said Jimmy's gonna walk. Jimmy's limp didn't bring out the best in him. But it did get him a new career as a bookie and business was booming. Of course, his partner Whitey did have to call in his uncle, Bob the Mouth, to help them cover a particularly large bet. When Jimmy couldn't pay, they decided to give Bob flying lessons. You couldn't exactly call him a natural. Now Jimmy's expanding into extortion. But Jenny's dad's business wasn't doing so good. He had money problems, so he decided to go to Dokey for help. Bad idea. So Jenny went to Tommy. And Tommy went to Kate. Trust me, it was strictly business. Father, I gotta tell you, I'm not really big on confession. I'm not here to save your soul. You think I'm an idiot? Or a miracle worker? Either one, you're wrong. Then what are you doing here? I came to visit. And I brought you a turkey sandwich. Look, don't try to con me, Father. You people are always trying to save somebody. Okay, you're right. I do want something. You see? We're all liars. I want to know what happened. "Happened"? The Donnelly brothers, they were great kids. Bobby Donnelly was a neighborhood legend. And now so many people are dead. Friends, family betraying each other, killing each other. I need to understand what happened. I think everything changed the day I bought Seanie that car. (TELEPHONE RINGING) It was the same day Tommy decided he was never gonna help anybody ever again. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hey, I could be wrong, but I think that's the phone, guys. Don't get it. Why not? 'Cause I don't want to talk to anybody. Suppose it's important. Then they'll call back. Tommy, I hate that. It's gonna drive me crazy all day if I don't know who that was. That's 'cause you're not a normal guy. You are? Hello. Hi, it's Kate. Can I speak to Tommy? Yeah, hold on. I'll see if he's here. It's Kate. Want to talk to her? Nice, Kevin. Like she doesn't really know I'm here now. What do you think she wants? I don't know. Maybe she wants the $10,000 I owe her. Maybe she wants to know why I robbed her. Maybe she wants to know why you killed her husband. Shut up, Jimmy. Okay, so do you want me to tell her that you're not here? Kate. No, you didn't wake me up. Sure, yeah. Okay. Okay. What did she want? She got a job for me. Great, you should take it. I don't even know what it is yet. Doesn't matter. Me, Kevin, Seanie, we got a good thing going on with the bar, bookmaking, everything's working out. Go live your life. JOEY. That was also the day Jimmy decided it was time he reminded people he was the oldest brother. Jimmy, we don't need the problems that this could bring. Whitey, if you want to be the man, you gotta grab what you want. After that whole thing with Uncle Bob... Forget about Uncle Bob. All I'm saying is that maybe it's not the smartest thing to be bringing this attention on us right now. No, it's exactly what we want. Everybody looking at us. You don't take over in one day. You build. That's what we're doing here, Whitey, we're building. (MAN GROANING) I'm sorry, what did you say? Forget the invoice! You don't have to pay! That means 20 cases, delivered here every week. It'll be a pleasure. (GROANING) JOEY. Jimmy hadn't felt this good since before the accident. Lift. I don't want to lift. We're doing this. Tommy, I hate this stupid brace. Morning. Dokey. We're all set. I signed here, you sign there, and we're in business. Look, I was just gonna come by and see you. What, you worried about the bank? Don't, okay? I got it all handled. Actually, we worked everything out at the bank this morning. You did what? You heard him. We won't be needing your help. Go take care of the customers. Dad... I got it, Jen. You come to me and you ask me to save your life. You say, "Oh, Dokey, it's gotta happen right away." I make it happen, and now you tell me you worked things out? I'm sorry, Dokey. Sign the papers. I'd be happy to pay you for your time. Yeah, where'd you get that kind of money? That's none of your business. How old are you, Reilly? What's my age have to do with anything? 'Cause you're way too old to be playing the hero. Now, you're gonna sign these papers. Maybe not today, but you will sign them. And I'll tell you why. 'Cause your little daughter down there? You got her future to think about, right? I'll be back. (GUNSHO TS) You're Tommy Donnelly, right? Yeah. You don't remember me. My husband worked with your dad. George McCready. Sure, how's he doing? He's gone. Been gone a while. Oh. Sorry. Yeah. I need some help. Help? The building I live in is being run over by a bunch of drug dealers. I've been there for 30 years. It was always a good building. Now you can't get in or out. You should go to the cops with that. I call, they come, the scum scatter, and five minutes later, the cockroaches are back. Okay. Then the person you really need is Dokey. Huey's brother? Yeah. I tried. The bastard wouldn't even talk to me. I mean, he might as well be one of them. I don't know what to tell you. It's a small neighborhood, Tommy, and people are saying you're the one to come to see now. Well, people are wrong. I thought since my husband and your dad were friends, that... Mrs. McCready, I can't help you. But your dad cared about people. What? Your father would never turn his back on a friend. I'm sorry for you that you never learned that from him. JIMMY: How we doing? Tremendous. We got $6,000 on the over, $5,600 on the under. Life is good. That mean I'm gonna finally see some of my money? I gotta go out. What? Where you going? We got work to do here. Give me the numbers later. You gonna bring me something back? No. Oh, you're all high and mighty now in your new shirt and your fancy hairdo, huh? Meet me at Christie's in an hour. You're gonna bring me something back, right? (SIGHS) I got more. Yeah? I got more if you want. JOEY. Sean was doing his own fixing up at the Firecracker, which is why he wanted a car. But I'll get to that in a minute. We turned the Firecracker into the hottest place in town. FATHER DUFELT: Joey. What? I've lived in the neighborhood 40 years. I still live there. The Firecracker's the Firecracker. Oh, yeah. No, it wasn't the Firecracker at all, it was this other place I was thinking about we took over a long time after. Took over? I mean bought. Damn. Okay, now you got me all screwed up. Let's go back to the Firecracker. Joey, I need to buy a car. So buy a car. The thing is, I don't have a license or proof of insurance or any of those things you need. Got it. I'll see what I can do. And I've only got two grand. But make sure you get me something good. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Firecracker. Hi, Ma. No, he isn't here. Okay. She says don't forget you have an appointment for school today. MAN: Where do you want it? Hey, fellows. Let's see. Right up there against that wall would be great. Thanks. Hey, Kevin, what about that stock you were gonna bring up? I'm on it. Look, Kevin. I'm the beverage manager now, so if I ask you to do something, you're supposed to do it. Kevin! Cellar. Now! Look, enough of this beverage manager crap, all right? You go do it yourself. Can't you see I'm busy? I'm getting ready for the lunch rush! We don't have a lunch rush! We're gonna have one. I'm putting on a special. Beer and a cheese sandwich for a buck. The beer costs us a buck. Come on, Kevin. Have a little pride. This is the family business here. Crime is the family business, Sean. This is just a staging area. What are you doing, anyway? This isn't your phone. Whose phone is this? It's Louie Downtown's. Give me it back. Jimmy told you to get rid of this. I'm going to. But there's this guy, Cloudy, and... Cloudy? Yeah, he's been trying to make losing bets all week, I couldn't pass it up. I'm calling Jimmy. What, are you Tommy now? Give me the phone. You gonna get that stock for me? What are you doing? Calling Ma. Figure she'd like to know you're not planning on going back to school. I want to go back inside. No. You gotta do this. You gotta walk like you're not hurt. But I am hurt! Don't think about it. See? JOEY. There were two things that hurt Jimmy more than anything else. He couldn't do anything about the limp. But the other... Jenny. Hey, Jimmy. How you doing? I'm busy. What do you want? Any specials? You always ask that and you always get the same thing, cheeseburger and fries. Well, maybe today I want something else. What's good? Pepper and egg sandwich is good. I'll get that. Pepper and egg, Dad. IAN: Got it! You got pretty hands. Shut up. No, I'm serious. Yeah, right. You know, Jenny, maybe me and you haven't been getting along the way we should. Yeah. I just think we should fix that. How are we planning on doing that? I don't know. Maybe if we go out sometime. Go see a movie, get a beer. What are you doing, Jimmy? I'm asking you out. You're such a jerk. IAN: Pepper and egg! How you feeling? Couldn't be better. (GIRLS GIGGLING) The hell with them. She's never gonna like me now. Yeah, she will. I'll talk to her for you. They're in the hall on the ground floor. Look, don't expect a lot. I'm just gonna go try and talk to these guys. You need something? I'm not buying. Then keep walking. You live here? Any of your friends live here? Be careful, sweetheart. I live here. My family lives here. Two blocks away. This is an Irish block. You can do your business six blocks east. Or a few blocks north or south. You're not gonna have any troubles finding another corner. You got about two seconds before I see your ass gone. Listen, I don't want any trouble. Yeah, I bet you don't. I'm just looking to give you a chance, that's all. Oh, you want to give me a chance? Yo, who is this guy, man? I might be a guy stupid enough to think I can walk in here and just ask you to leave. But do I look that stupid to you? Yeah. Yeah, you look pretty stupid to me. All right. Or maybe I'm somebody you should know about. So think about another corner. Listen, I tried. You should call the police again. Oh, jeez... Look. Thank you. NICKY. Are you sure it's Jack Trevor? The Irish councilman? VINNIE: It's definitely him. And he's with Dokey and Alo? What am I speaking, German? Yeah. Alo just went in. What the hell is going on? That's what I said. $200 a week! That'll get you my protection! Let me stop you, jerk-off. I got protection. You're pulling a gun on me? Jimmy, what the hell are you doing? We don't have to kill the guy. Jimmy, he's gonna pay! You're gonna pay, right? (QUAVERING) Oh... (CLICKS) What are you, out of your mind? Jimmy, look! He's paying... Please don't shoot! He paid, he paid, all right? Put the gun down. Jimmy! No! (GUN CLICKS) Oh, jeez. He paid. He paid. Oh, jeez. Tell him we'll see him next week! I'm sorry about that, buddy. We'll see you next week. Two double cheese, one club, no bacon, with fries, one Reuben, no fries, one side salad. You okay? What? What? You okay? Yeah. Why? Nothing. Thanks, honey. Oh, that looks so... Hi. Samson, what are you doing here? I just wanted to come by and talk to you about... Look, you're a really nice guy, but I... I can't go out with you, okay? Not now, not ever. And I'm sorry, I really thought I made that clear. What happened between you and me was a mistake. Yeah. It's just that I got a new job delivering for a different company. Just wanted to let you know, that's all. Guess I caught you at a bad time, right? Okay. I feel like an idiot. Prove it. Say you'll go out with me. I'm kidding. It's okay, I understand. We're cool. And you have a good day. Okay. Thanks. Wow. Are those mine? Found them when I was clearing out some of Huey's old things. Put them away, please. Huey always said you had talent. Now I know why. Anyway, I thought you'd want them back. Thanks. So you don't need help with anything? Actually, I did have a reason for calling you. Matthew's been spending a lot of time with his Uncle Dokey. And I don't like it. I'd rather he spend time with you. Somebody who could teach him something worthwhile like art. Kate, I don't know. I know what I'm asking. But I don't know who else to turn to. I'll pay you. You'll pay me? Mmm-hmm. That's kind of ridiculous, considering the fact that I just borrowed $10,000 from you. I don't care about that. All I care about is Matthew. Sure. I thought maybe we could start later today. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hello, Kevin. Hi, I was wondering if my brother Tommy was here. Hi. I'll see you. You need to get a cell phone, Tommy. I'm sick of being the one that has to do everything. I have to help out with the bar, I have to take orders from Sean because Jimmy made him the beverage manager, and now I gotta deliver you a message. What message? You gotta stop trying to help people, Tommy. It's a bad thing. Kevin, the message? This Mrs. McCready keeps calling. Every time the phone rings, it's her. She says, "They're back." What the hell does that mean, "They're back"? How'd she sound? Desperate. Why do you think she called five times? You're doing good here, Sean. Thanks. I'm proud of you. Let's go. We're leaving. I can't go anywhere, I got a business to run. Come on. Joey, make the sandwiches. Don't worry, I'm on it. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Here. Don't take advantage. Remember to tell all your friends. No problem. Firecracker. Hey, Mrs. Donnelly. Is Sean there with you? No, Sean's not here. Well, what about Kevin or Jimmy? I think they went to go play some softball. Where the hell is everybody? I had to close the doors. You closed the doors? Why? You didn't leave me enough cheese. I had to go out, get some more. When I came back, the guys had eaten all the bread. I just got so confused, I lost track of the stock. I've been wearing, like, four hats here. I had to shut it down. Are you kidding me? Joey. Where's the money? You see, that's the other thing. Jimmy's gonna kill me. (LAUGHING) You think it's funny? No, but I'm having a better day than you. I just won myself a G-note. That guy, Cloudy, lost his bet? Yeah. I'm setting up a meet. Wondering how I'm gonna spend all that beautiful, beautiful money. This is great. This is just great. DOKEY: Hey, Tommy. How you doing? I'm great, Doke. You? Oh, I'm doing great. Just wonderful, you know? The whole neighborhood's doing good. You, me, the Reillys. You know, they're gonna be able to keep their diner after all. I didn't know they were having troubles. No? No. You know, Tommy, for the life of me, I can't figure out who else they'd go to, you know, if they needed help. Yeah, it wasn't me. Okay. I need a favor from you. Yeah? Yeah, this hanging around with Matthew... It's just not working for me. What do you mean? What I mean is, this is my nephew. And I don't want my nephew hanging around with somebody who would steal from his mother. You understand? Wait a minute. You're the one who told me to... No, no, no. Don't talk. Just do what I ask. (MUSIC PLAYING) I like that. No, I like that. Yeah. So who else was there? I don't know. Ray was there. And there was this broad carrying some folders and a briefcase. Must be an assistant or something. All right. Good. You set up that meet? Done. So this thing that you got going on. Is it a "thing"? You looking for particulars? No. Mmm-hmm. Well, maybe... Oh, that's gotta hurt. Hey, you. I'll meet you in the back in five minutes. You can't wait till we get home? It's better in the back. That's my dirty boy. She said "home." As in "co-habitation" home? Don't you got something to do? Yeah. Thank you. And then he was, like... (EXCLAIMING) KEVIN: Ow! Look what you did. Look what you did. (BOTH CHATTERING) Hey! What? Cool it. I gotta make a phone call. Hello? Kate, it's Tommy. Hey, Tommy, where are you? We're waiting. You know what, I'm not gonna be able to make it today. Why? I was wondering if we could do it another time, because, uh, something came up. Damn, I shouldn't have told him. What? I already told Matthew. He was really looking forward to it. You know what? It's all right. I'll take him for pizza or something. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Time to move on to boilermakers, my friend. KEVIN: You see that? You ever do that, Jimmy? Ever hit a guy in the back of the head with a Louisville Slugger? It sounds just like you're smashing coconuts. Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. I took this one guy out at the knees. Bang! Boom! I hear you did a good thing today, Tommy. Helping out poor Mrs. McCready. She was a friend of dad's, Jimmy. I wonder if he bought any drugs from her. 'Cause I've only been buying from her since I was 14. You're a liar. Yeah, you're right. I'm lying. It's probably not the same old Mrs. McCready who lives in the apartment 2C in the old flats? 'Cause if you kicked some gangster ass for that old bitch, that would be the jackass move of the month. Come on, Whitey, we got work to do. Got ten? Thanks. Cool! You made him cry. Give me the money. All right, where to next? Right there, I think. They get a pass. Jimmy, you let one guy off the hook, it gets out. Everybody stops paying. I know that, dumbass. Is she a friend of yours? Go get a smoke or something. What'll it be? We need to talk. About what? Protection. Protection? I'm doing that kind of work now. Taking care of the neighborhood. You want to keep using that good leg, you better turn around right now. Here's the deal. 50 bucks a week, and I'll be sure to tailor my services to whatever you think you need. You're nothing but a piece of crap. You know, you should be thanking me. I'm giving you a break here because we known each other a long time. I'm charging you a quarter of what everyone else has to pay. You're a real prince. Get the hell out of my diner. Jesus! You punk! (IAN GROANING) Jimmy! Keep walking. Look out! You hit my father, you scumbag! Jimmy! Give it back! Get the hell off of me! Let her go, Whitey! I want it back! I want the money back! Jenny! All this 'cause I wouldn't go out with you? We're not gonna give you a nickel, not ever! Wake up! Somebody always gets paid! From now on it's gonna be me! JOEY. Now, I know Jimmy may have seemed like an ass. Excuse me, Father. It's just that it's hard not to behave like an ass, when you've been betrayed. Are you crying? An '88 Camry, Joey? I thought you were gonna look out for me. Sean, face it. Your playboy days are over. No, I'll tell you what. This thing has got 227,000 miles on it. And that's a good thing? Yeah! And it still runs like a dream. You can't kill this car. Yeah. (SEAN CHUCKLING) (KEVIN GROANING) Congratulations. KEVIN: You just spit on the car. JOEY: That's all right. It comes off. Hey, hey, hey! What do you think? You paid money for this thing? Yeah, 2,000. Got a great deal. Dollars? Plus it came with a free driver's license. How's it run? Like a top. Get in back. SEAN: Where we going? TOMMY: McCready's. VINNIE: Finally. (PHONE RINGING) NICKY. Hello? It's me. She's the councilman's chief of staff. And then some. Hey, you there? Yeah, I'm here. All right. Just stay with her. You sure you don't want me on that other thing? No, no, no, no, no. I got that. Hang up. (MOANING) Nicky? (MOANING) Oh, hell. I don't want to hear any of that! Here. Yeah. (GROANS) Oh, God. We should call Frankie. Don't call anybody. Especially not the police. Well, what are you gonna do? Pay him. No way. It's the way it works, Jenny. I'm not gonna argue this with you. Well, I can't believe you're thinking about paying him, Dad. This is Jimmy Donnelly! He's nothing! He's a nobody! I said that about his father a lot of years ago. You don't want to know where that got me. What... Bobby Donnelly took money from you? Right up until the day he died. Now it's his kid's turn. Big surprise, huh? Take a right here, Seanie. Sean, Sean, stop! There's Jimmy. Jimmy! Jimmy! Get in. Where we going? I need you to buy some drugs for me. Sure! You want to come? No. I'll see you back at Joanie's. Whose ride is this? I love it! Evie! Hey! Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing? Oh, God! We heard a drug dealer lives here! Yeah, I know. Kids and single women live here. It can be pretty scary! MRS. McCREADY: You little cockroach! You're barred, Jimmy, you understand me? I'll worry about that when you get the new door. Give me that! Give me that! Give me my door! Come on, Jimmy! What do you think you're you doing? Get away from that! (MIMICKING AIRPLANE) Hey, you don't have to pretend to be worried about Matthew. When you tell a child that you're gonna do something, they count on it. It's my fault for asking you. JOEY: Hey, not for nothing. I like the door, but what are we gonna do with it? SEAN: I can put some legs on it. It'll make for a nice lounge table. It's a door. They don't come cheap. We should sell this thing. Screw that! This door is a symbol of our triumph! Over a skank drug-dealing bitch! I'm thinking we're gonna mount this baby somewhere right above the bar. Hey, I'm not gonna have to paint it, am I? Hey, Jenny. What's that? $50. Next week's payment. I don't need that now. When next week comes, it comes. No. You don't come back to the diner, ever. What's going on? The only protection I need is you never coming near me or my father again. $50 is a cheap price for that. I'll bring it to you. Jenny... To hell with you, too! Jenny! SEAN: Jimmy, what'd you do? Sean, shut up. You extort money from Jenny? From her father? It's business, Tommy. Stay out of it. Hey, Tommy, Tommy. Get up. I would if you let me. You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! How could you do that? To Jenny. It was easy! Don't you care about anybody anymore? Oh, that's right, Tommy! I forgot! You care about everybody! You're the big savior! I'm the scumbag! You keep telling yourself that, Tommy! I'm ashamed of you, Jimmy. Jimmy loved Tommy more than anybody. But see, once you've been betrayed by somebody you love, you're capable of anything. Maybe it would have been different if Jimmy knew what really happened on the roof that day. Why won't you go out with Jimmy? It's 'cause of his leg, isn't it? No. Then why? It's because I like you. I can't do that to my brother, Jenny. Who wants a drink? How we doing in here? We're great. Want to see? Mmm-hmm. Wow. That's amazing. We're gonna color it red. Oh, it doesn't have to be red, right, Matthew? You can make it any color you want. I'll have to think about that. Make sure you sign it. Hey. Listen, I been thinking. There's a friend of mine. Mine and Huey's. He owns a studio. Actually, he's a famous artist. Leo Munst. You know him? Yeah, of course. I think it might be good for you to meet him. That's great. He having a showing or something? I mean meet him. You know, get his advice on some things. He's an amazing artist. It'd be good for you. Wow. I already told you, I think you have potential. NICKY: Kevin Donnelly. You're just the guy I've been looking for. Me? You're not looking for me. Oh, yeah. I am. Actually, I need a favor. I'm a little short this week, so I need you to spot me another day. I don't get it. For the grand I owe you. You're Cloudy? Actually,
