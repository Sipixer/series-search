How'd you get naked photos of her? She asked Tommy to have his wake at The Firecracker. A little awkward, seeing as Tommy did kill Huey. But Tommy had bigger problems. Like Huey's brother, Dokey, who thought Jimmy killed Huey. Actually, Jimmy killed Louie the bookie. And since no bookie means no money for Louie's boss, Nicky, Tommy has to make up the difference every week. Did I mention Sean was still in the hospital? He was getting a little TLC from Kim, or at least until his mom showed up. But that's not the point. Back to Tommy. See, there was nothing Tommy wanted more than Jenny. But after what Tommy did to Huey, Jenny decided to want something else and chose a delivery guy, Samson, and right in front of Tommy. Now that had to hurt. I'm not lying. Joey, you're pathological. Hey, that's not very nice. You believe that what you're telling me is true? I need to understand this, Joey, in order to continue your therapy. If I'm pathological, every guy in my neighborhood's a clinical study. Let's try starting with one truth. Little steps. Sean Donnelly, was he in the hospital? Yes, he was. Well, see? That wasn't so hard, was it? Actually, he was leaving the hospital. Hey, Seanie. Let's get going. Quit rushing me. I'm late for class, and I already missed three days. Big deal. Kind of a big deal, Sean. Would you leave me alone? I'm sick. You're not sick. I'm injured. Let's go, come on! Stop it! Tommy, go and get the paperwork I need to sign. (CELL PHONE RINGING) It's that girl, Kim. I don't want to talk to anybody. What's the matter, Seanie? Nothing. Look at me, Sean. I want you to go back to school. That's Tommy, Ma. I was no good at school. Because you didn't try. This time I'm gonna make you. Because this is never gonna happen to you again. JOEY. Even someone as good as Jenny Reilly couldn't start the day without lying. Hey. Hi. I was just gonna write you a note. Really? It looks like you were gonna sneak out on me. No. I didn't wanna wake you. Well, Jenny, I was joking. I mean, unless you really were. Were you? JOEY. But then, is it really a lie if you're trying to spare someone's feelings? I just have to get to work. It's okay, I'll walk you out. JENNY: No, no, don't get up. I'm sorry, Samson. This was wrong, and... You are such a sweet guy and last night I thought I could do this, but I'm still stuck. There's someone else. That's fine. It is? I mean, if you're not ready, you're not ready, so I could just leave the ball in your court. Yeah. Thanks. Of course, I'll be hoping you call. Don't. (TRAIN RUMBLING PAST) JOEY: Hello? Who's that? Jimmy? What are you doing? This is a bar, not a place to sleep. I was just resting my eyes. Want some wine? Are you nuts? There's an alien inside my head. You're a wuss. (CELL PHONE RINGING) What is that? Somebody's cell phone. Where's it coming from? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Over there. Hello? Damn it. Hung up. What were you gonna say? "Hi, I don't know whose phone this is?" I know whose phone it is, it's Louie Downtown's. You think he dropped it when you had him tied up down here? When who had who tied up down where? No idea. I'll get the bags in the back, Mom. What do we owe you? Let's try this again, huh? Go back out the door, and make a right, two buildings up. Two buildings up. Thank you. You're very nice. At least I'm not lost. What the hell are you doing here? Hey, Tommy. Nice to see little Seanie up and about. What the hell are you doing here? It's payday. You got my money? I told you already, you're not getting any money. See, that's what you don't know yet. I am gonna get my money. By midnight tonight. And you're the one that's gonna be giving it to me. Don't get near my mother or anyone in my family again, you understand me? The way to avoid that is to pay me my money. You come here again, I'll kill you. You know where to find me, kid. Just bring a handful of cash. (GUNSHO TS) HELEN: What took you? Just giving that guy directions. To two doors down? He was all confused. Kevin, come here a minute. I'm eating my cereal. What, is it gonna get cold? Soggy. I hate that. Kevin... Nicky wants the money. And he's not taking no for an answer. So? You already told him you weren't gonna pay him and nothing happened. Because it wasn't due until today. He was talking to Ma in the hall. He touches Ma, he's dead. We can't kill him. Why not? We kill Nicky, this whole thing unravels. Louie Downtown, Huey, Sal, everything. They'll find out about all of it. So you got a better idea? I'm gonna get the money. How you gonna do that? I got a way. JOEY. Tommy didn't have a way. But that's the thing about a lie. Sometimes you gotta tell one until you come up with something better. I'll see you soon. Where you going? TOMMY: School. Stay with Mom. Don't let her out of your sight. Can't Sean do that? Can't Sean do what? Sean just got out of the hospital. Well, he looks okay to me. Hey, I'm right here. What are you guys talking about? Huey, the Italians, what? 'Cause I know everything, so what are we doing? We're not doing anything. Ma goes anywhere, you go, too. Twenty-three AR with missiles. What do you think that means? Don't know. What about B32 Colts. Fifty X. I don't know about the numbers, but Colts gotta be football Colts, right? Right. Some guy named B32 bet on the Colts. There's a whole bunch of them on here. PA31, JR32, and it goes on like that. You think Louie's got his whole book in there? I do think that. I think half the bets on here gotta be losers. Probably more. Too bad Louie's not around to collect. Get Kevin down here. Let's figure this thing out. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? What? No, I can't. Because I can't. Look, tell Jimmy if he needs my help, he's gotta come over here. What? Hey! Hey, Tommy, how you doing? I'm great. How you doing? Look, Tommy, I've always liked you. And I don't want to have any problems with you, I just... I want to let you know that Jenny and I got together last night. Look, I didn't want you to hear about it from anybody but me. What does that mean, you got together? Tommy, it ain't right to ask that. Okay, I'm trying to do the right thing here, I hope you appreciate that. Like I said, I'm not looking for any problems. No problems. All right. Take care, all right? Yeah. Okay. You outlasted me. You won't come in, I'll come to you. Thanks, Father, but I'm not here for confession. You've been on your knees for 45 minutes. I know a sin when I see one. (SIGHS) I feel terrible. You look terrible. Thanks. Well, tell me about it. I broke my vows this week. Okay. And I did it again last night. With someone else. And you feel bad about that? Yes. Good, you should. What's worse, I did it to hurt the person I'm really in love with. Who was the first guy. Who isn't your husband? No. I don't know what to do, Father. I just make one mistake after another. It's been over a year now. Marked a new anniversary on my calendar. The day my husband never came home. Well, thank God for small favors. Your husband was a louse. You should never have gotten involved with him in the first place. Want my advice? Not if it comes with penance. Undo your problems, one at a time. Are you telling me to get a divorce? Well, the Church still believes that divorce is punishable by the flames of hell. I'd look into an annulment. KEVIN: Fifty X means times five, so that's $250 on the Colts to win. This is stupid. No one's gonna pay you Louie's money. JIMMY: What's the B32? The customers' code names. The ones that aren't gonna be giving you any money. How do you know it's a code name? Because I had a code name. And I wouldn't be giving you any money, by the way. What was your code name? It's not important. Kevin, I'm gonna beat you up if you don't tell me. L21. What's the L for? Lucky. Lucky? This is why I don't tell you things. Wait, 21, what's that? This is stupid. It's the number that Louie would give you. Try the speed dial. Lucky 21. Here you are. You want to know how much you owe? Don't! Don't! All right! Do not. Now if you lost, then what? Louie or someone from the office would call you on payday and tell you how much you owe. All right, this is good. When's payday? Today. Or if you won, then he'd give you the money on Tuesday. We won't be needing Tuesdays. Give me the phone. Hey, this is Jimmy. From the office. Your number for the week is 250. No, no, Louie's out of town. I'll be making the pickups. JOEY: See you later, Kev. KIM: Hey, Tommy? Tommy! Tommy, I need to talk to you. Oh, hey, Kim. It's about Sean. What about him? He's ignoring me. I'm sure he doesn't mean to. Yeah, so did you say anything to him? About what? About me being a slut. What? I mean, I'm not a slut, but is that what you told him? Why would I do that? 'Cause when we met, I thought you were gonna ask me out, and then I went out with your little brother. Kim, I don't care about that. Then why won't he see me? I have no clue. But if I were you, I'd go stand outside our front door and wait until he gives you an answer. You would? Yeah, I'd go right now. Tommy Donnelly. I'm dropping out next semester. You don't sound so sure about that. I'm sure. I just want my money back. Well, sorry, that we can't do. No, no. I checked. I got 10 days to withdraw from classes, and today's the tenth day. Yes, but you don't have the... No, no. I'm within the deadline. I need my money back. Mr. Donnelly, if you'll just listen for a second. Okay. Your tuition wasn't paid this semester. What? Actually, it was paid but then it was cancelled. Cancelled? Who cancelled it? JOEY. Huey Farrell had been paying Tommy's tuition through the union. Up until this moment, Tommy somehow believed that killing Huey wasn't gonna change that. The hardest lies are the ones we believe ourselves. Like Jimmy thinking you could go out and make a lot of money and respect would follow. Jimmy, we're up to six guys. How many of these collections are we gonna make? What's the matter, you don't like money? MAN ON PHONE. Hello? Hey, it's Jimmy from the office. Yeah, what's up? Your number for the week's $440. No, no, Louie's out of town. I'll be making the pickups. Joey. Where do you guys usually meet? You seen Tommy? No, I haven't seen him? Want one? No, thanks. 6:00, I'll be there. Jenny! Yeah, Jimmy? Good times last night, huh? Sure, Jimmy, if that's what you call a good time. Oh, I don't mean the part about Dokey holding us hostage in the basement and almost chopping off our toes. That sucked. I mean last time I saw you. You know, it's funny. I never would have known you were married. Does Samson know? Just tell Tommy I was here, okay? I'll be sure to tell Tommy, I mean Samson, I mean Tommy. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. Anybody could make a mistake, right? Did I miss something? Yeah. How a guy can waste 15 years of his life on some backstabbing, open-her-legs-for-any-dumbass bread man whore. You're talking about Tommy, right? Shut up. Time to start collecting the money. Grab the phone, idiot! Yeah. I had it. You made me forget with all that Jenny stuff. I told you to shut up about that. Yeah. Okay, I'm done. Shut up. MAN: Every month with this guy. Then do what you feel is best. It's your business. Thanks for taking a minute, Dokey, I appreciate it. Absolutely. After last night, you and I are old friends. What can I do for you? I guess you know I go to art school downtown. Yeah, I heard. But art school, that's not like real school, right? That's... The tuition was taken care of by the union. Huey said it was covered under my father's death benefits. Yeah, well, it wasn't. It was a handout. And you know that. And that's why I cancelled it. Well, we got a problem, Dokey, 'cause I was counting on that money. The problem you and I have is you think I'm stupid enough to take food out of the mouths of my men? That money came from union coffers, Tommy. My brother, he was a jerk with a soft heart. And I'm not. Last night, when I told you about kidnapping an Italian to get out from under a debt... Yeah? Well, we're not quite out from under. I'm in the hole to Nicky for 25 a week. The first payment's due tonight. So? If I can't get that tuition money, Dokey, I'm gonna need to borrow $2,500. Tommy, tell me one person who would loan a kid like you that kind of money? I was hoping you would. Well, then I'm afraid you got your head up your ass. But I'll tell you what I will do. I'll throw you a job. What kind of a job? I've noticed that you've become pretty tight with my sister-in-law. Kate? Not more than anyone else. Well, she's got something inside the house, and all I want you to do is get it for me. You want me to rob from your sister-in-law? Huey had an office in the basement. There's a large box in the desk. Now, I'm not gonna confuse you by telling you what's in the box. All I want you to do, grab it and bring it back here. Forget it. Hey. You bring me that box, and your problem with Nicky goes away. I can't rob a widow. I'll figure it out. Kevin, you damn dummy. What? You didn't pull the door shut. Yes, I did. Not all the way, it didn't latch. Ma, let me go ahead of you. What the hell for? I don't know. What are you all worried about, Kevin? You owe people money again? No. Then stop acting like an idiot! KEVIN: Seanie? SEAN: Yeah, what? (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? NICKY. Now you know you closed that door, right? But it makes you wonder. Someone's been inside. Maybe left something. Nicky? Tell your brother clock's ticking. Look, you go to hell... (PHONE DISCONNECTS) You find him? No. Where's he calling from? I don't know, Tommy, he scared the hell out of me. Mom know anything? No. Tommy, let's rob somebody and give him his money, but let's kill him. Kevin, relax. Where's Mom? In the kitchen. Hey, Ma. Hi. How we doing? Good. Your brother's acting a little weird. Yeah. What's that? Casserole for Seanie. What are you doing? I'm taking the casserole. You keep an eye on Ma? Yeah. Tommy. Hey. My mother made a casserole. She asked me to drop it off. That was nice. Please thank her for me. I will. And you, too. The wake was just what I wanted. And everything you said was beautiful. Huey had to be smiling down. I hope so. Is that one of his sweaters? Oh... Yeah. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... I should go. It's ugly, isn't it? He never wore it. But it was made in Ireland, so he'd never get rid of it. And now I can't seem to, either. You cleaning out his closets? I've been at it two hours, this is as far as I've gotten. I could help you. No, it wouldn't be a problem. That would be wonderful. Yeah. MAN 1: The soup smells good. MAN 2: Yeah. Dad? Yeah? The hamburger patties, they were in the oven. What? The patties that were delivered this morning, did you put them in the oven? You're asking me if I put the hamburger patties in the oven? You think I'm an idiot? Well, somebody did it. I didn't. Well, I didn't do it, either. Well, one of us did. I vote for you. Order another box. Damn waste of money, Jen. Hi, Mrs. Donnelly. Hello. I was wondering if Sean was here. He is, but he's sleeping. Mom? Who's that? Oh, hey. What's the matter with you today, huh? Nothing, I'm sorry. I just wanted to see who it was. Kevin, is Sean really sleeping? I just told you he was sleeping. Mrs. Donnelly, I know Sean's in there, and I don't think he's sleeping. And I'm not gonna leave without talking to him. Ma. Damn! What do you want from my Seanie? Why don't you like me? If someone's told you something, tell me. Nobody has to say anything. All I have to do is look at you and I can tell you're wrong for my son. Isn't it bad enough that he already took this terrible beating for you? For me? What'd you do, huh? Did you give these fellows a little smile, a little wave? Playing the big shot beauty? God knows what my other sons had to do to avenge this. So you just do me a favor and stay the hell out of our lives. Sean'll do just fine without you. Hey, how we doing out here? Shut the door, Kevin, or I'm gonna hit you in the head with something. Okay, okay. Did Sean say I did any of that? Sean's too much of a gentleman to say anything. Please don't come back. Can you give Sean a message for me? (STUTTERING) Not if my Mom doesn't want me to. What kind of people are you? Worst part was going to the morgue. Identifying the body. I can't imagine. It wasn't the bullet hole. It was seeing him in this awful plastic bag. I'm sorry. Have you been to a morgue? No. Huey loved the cold. He, he hated the heat. Irish blood. That's what I thought about, looking at him. That he would have liked how cold it was. MATTHEW: Mom? Honey? I'm ready for bed. Oh. Did you brush your teeth? Yeah. Come here. Open your mouth. Breathe. You still need to brush your teeth. Oh, jeez. Moms will catch you every time. Go on. I'll be in to kiss you good night. I hope he didn't hear all that. No, he didn't. Can I help you guys with something? We're from the office. What office is that? Louie's office. I'm Ryan. That's Steve-O. How's it going? Where's Jimmy? Jimmy? Jimmy who? Jimmy. The guy who called me from the office, said he was working for Louie. Jimmy couldn't come. He sent me. You know what? This whole thing stinks. You have Jimmy or Louie call me from the office. I'll deal with them. All right, wait a minute. I am Jimmy. He is. He really is Jimmy. Get the hell out of my office. Just pay me the money. I'm not paying. Joey, shut the blinds. Joey? What happened to Steve-O? So? Perfect. What? Joey! Get in here and hit this guy! (MEN GRUNTING) Come on, Steve-O, let's go. Matthew's a good kid. I always feel bad he's an only child. It must be great having a lot of brothers. I don't know about great. I know it's a lot of headache. I had three brothers growing up. They were always hitting and biting and kicking. It was ridiculous. But now I think it's good for boys. They need that physical thing. Were you guys like that? A little bit. My brothers were so vicious, they would knee each other in the balls, headlocks. Except one thing, they would never punch in the face. Is that how you guys were? No, we punch in the face. Really? Yeah. That's the first place we go. Our mother taught us that. I'll tell you what. You really feel like Matthew's missing out, why don't you just send him over to our house? We can hold down one of my brothers, and we'll let Matthew kick the crap out of him. You okay? I know how close you were to Huey, but you barely know me and Matthew. Sorry. Okay. Ma, turn it off, please. Sorry, did I wake you? No. Hungry? Can you bring it in? What's the matter? Nothing. Look at me. Would you look at me, please? Is that what you're worried about? What your face looks like? It's pretty bad. What you look like, your face... I know that's who you think you are, but it's not. It's what's inside your heart, that's what makes you a Donnelly. Your father would be ashamed of you if you thought anything else. Now I'm gonna put dinner on. And I'm not bringing it in here. JOEY. See, the thing about telling lies is if you're good at it, people don't know they're being lied to. So then the question is, can you live with the lies you tell? KATE: Tommy? Yeah. You leaving? Yeah, it's getting late. What time is it? It's 9:00. Oh, okay. Well... Sorry about all the crying. Don't be silly. Good night. Good night. Did you look in it? No. If I were you, I would've at least taken a peek. I didn't wanna be tempted. And I figured you knew exactly how much was in there. Smart. JOEY. Being a thief made Tommy feel pretty bad. $2,500. Getting robbed made him feel a lot worse. The deal was you were gonna make my problem go away. I will. This week. That wasn't the deal. Sure it was, Tommy. No. You said you were gonna talk to Nicky and make my problem go away. I held up my end and you... Yeah, well, let me just stop you right there, okay? I think maybe what we have here is a communication problem between you and I. Let's call it that. Because calling it anything else could result in you losing your toes. You're right. It was my mistake. Next time we do business, I'll make sure we understand each other. By the way, I need to ask you a favor. What's that? I need an address. Put a plate out for your brother. He's not coming out. Put another plate out. He doesn't want anybody seeing him looking like a Cyclops. I heard that. I'm just kidding. You look like half a Cyclops. What about me? HELEN: There's not enough for you. Have another piece of bread. That's not fair. You should have thought about that when you let Tommy steal my casserole. Go out and eat, you haven't been out of my hair all day. I don't want to go out. Have some squash. I don't like squash. I don't even like saying it. This is great, Mom. It's $2,500. We're even. Even? That's right. I'm done. I'll tell you why. One of the last things Huey Farrell said to me was my brother Sean wasn't supposed to get beat up. I'm thinking you did that on your own. I'm thinking that's a piece of information that Sal's boss, Alo, would like to hear. That's why the $2,500 makes us even. That pastry for your mother? Why don't you say hi for me? She lives upstairs, right? You find something amusing about what just happened? If you had to bet on him or Dokey, who would you bet on? Dokey. Okay, I missed something, right? JOEY. For a moment Tommy believed that what he had done might have been worth it. (CHATTERING) Hey. Jenny. I was in here earlier looking for you. Tommy! Nine ball! Me and you, partners. I can't lose again tonight. Makes one of us, Jimmy. Maybe want to go outside and talk. Didn't we do that last night? I know I hurt you last night, I'm sorry. You wanted something else, I get it. JIMMY: Tommy! Come on, we need a fourth. Jimmy, shut the hell up, we're trying to have a conversation! I give up, don't shoot. What? What I did last night was mean. And stupid. Did you sleep with him? Yeah. You could have lied to me. Tommy. I don't want to be the person that I was last night. I need a fresh start. I need to not be married, I need to not be with you, I need to not be with another guy in order to get at you. Jenny, I don't want to hear it. I mean, whatever you gotta do, you should just do it. Okay? Guess I'll go then. Good. JIMMY: You made the balls go back. KEVIN: That was nice! Oh! I got it! (MEN CHEERING) (PHONE RINGING) Hey, Firecracker. Tommy, it's Kate. I need you to come back. I came down here after you left. I thought maybe I'd put it someplace else. I've been in and out of it so much with all the arrangements. Is there anything else missing? No. How much was it? It's not the money. See, he can get into my house any time he wants. Who? That bastard brother-in-law of mine, Dokey. Oh. He has Huey's keys. Says he doesn't, but he does. The two of them worked down here. So what do you want me to do? Change the locks. TOMMY: Okay. Can you do it tonight? Uh-huh. Find a place open, not in the neighborhood. Dokey owns all the locksmiths. Sure. (CREAKING) You hear that? No, what? Matty's crying. Hey, it's okay, baby. It's my fault, I should have left your light on. Okay? Can I have a juice? Okay. But then it's back to bed. You want something, Tommy? No, I'm fine. Thanks. Okay. Here you go. I left the lights on in the basement. I saw what you did. What? But I won't tell. JOEY. Like I said,
