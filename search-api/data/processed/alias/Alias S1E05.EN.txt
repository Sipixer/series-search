was a covert branch of the CIA. I was trained as a spy, warned not to tell anyone what I did. I thought I was working for the good guys until I told my fiancé about SD-6, and they had him killed. That's when I learned the truth, that SD-6 is part of the enemy I thought I was fighting. Now, I'm a double agent, working with the real CIA to bring down SD-6. My only ally is another double agent, a man I hardly know. My father. Is the winner of the Edgar Peace Prize working with Jacqnoud? Dhiren Patel is India's UN delegate. No way is he working with Jacqnoud. Your objective is to monitor the meeting, ID the client and make sure whatever Jacqnoud is up to doesn't happen. Patel is our delivery man. I'll need the piece by tomorrow. Damn it. That bodyguard, I know him. Corsica two years ago. Son of a bitch broke my arm. You. I know you. The man Jacqnoud is meeting with is Malik Sawari. He specialises in industrial demolition. Jacqnoud will plant an explosive on Patel? Yes. I want you two to stop it. - 20 on Patel. - Let's get them out. Something's wrong. He looks sick. He just went down. If they're bombing this place, it'll be the opening ceremonies. Careful with that. That's TNT. Yes, don't kill us, please. Recognise me now? Anyone else? Keep looking. I never did find out what you were doing in Corsica. Are you working for Dimitri? Tell me now or you're going in the fire. Who sent you here? Are you here alone? Who sent you here? Answer me. Bitch. Get to level C now. She got away. Oh, my God. What time is it? - Dixon, it's me. - Where've you been? I didn't sleep. It doesn't matter. Have you spotted Patel? He just showed up. News agencies report he had an arrhythmia. What I'm about to say, just believe me. Of course. The bomb we're looking for, it's inside of him. - What? - Inside Patel. They implanted the bomb into his chest, like a pacemaker. A simple outpatient procedure. Jacqnoud turned a Peace Prize winner into a human bomb which is not good. - Did you see the device? - Yeah. It's small. It's probably on a wireless remote. Get Patel and I'll meet you behind the auditorium. I'll get there as soon as I can. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honour to officially open the 2001 ministerial conference of the United Commerce Organisation. Please welcome our keynote speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, Dhiren Patel. I just punched Dhiren Patel. - Any luck? - I worship this man. In the building, did you ID the trigger? No. I didn't see anyone. Oh, God. Please wait one moment. I will be right back. I know you've been field-trained, but can you do this? - Pull a bomb out of a man's chest? - Yeah. It's Jacqnoud. Don't forget. This thing's on a remote. You can't let them get within range. Get me closer. Get me closer. - I can feel it. - Oh, God. - Police roadblock. - Get around it. Oh, God. Get me closer! You've got to hurry. They put an adhesive on the incision. It must have bled through. It's stuck. Closer. Oh, God! What's that? It's on a delay. Just keep driving. Now. Nicely done. Patel sahib. You're going to be OK. - That's insane. - No kidding. Dixon just pulled it out of him? - Pulled a bomb out of Patel? - The very one. - Any luck with the alliance member? - The what? You were supposed to ID the minister. Thanks, I remember. No. - Sydney, to take down SD-6... - Stop. I'm just saying... I was trying to keep an important humanitarian from blowing up. Fine. Anyway, I have a paper to finish. I have something for you. I know you have a lot of questions about your father. I don't know if you want this, but I copied his file. Thank you. Sorry I'm late. - It's after 1:00? - It's 1:30. You got to be kidding? OK, I'm in my Technology Management class. I realise two things. - One, I prepared the wrong chapter. - No. I don't wanna talk about it. Two, you and I are gonna have a Hallowe'en party. Guest list. - What, is it too big? - You put down everyone we've met. - You invited Kenny. - So? He's a kid. It's Hallowe'en. If you wanna see Charlie again, don't throw a Hallowe'en party and invite his nephew. - I love Kenny. - I know you do. Just admit you're hoping, just a little, that Charlie will bring him. - What? - Is that Will? Maybe it's about the humiliating kiss. - Stop calling it that. - That's what it was. You know, I gotta call you back. I got to go. I'll call you back. Bye. - What are you doing here? - Oh, I got this... I'm writing a story on SATs, about how the university is... - What are you guys doing? - Lunch. - We're having a Hallowe'en party. - Do I have to wear a costume? - No. - Yeah. Really? That's... confusing. - Let me guess. The bank. - A meeting with the higher-ups. - Seriously, your job? - It's a problem? - I should go. - We know. - I'll call you guys later, OK? - See you. This is Hensel Corporation. A Germany-based chemical conglomerate. They make ibuprofen, hand lotion, toothpaste. They also have a multi-million-dollar research fund with ties going back to World War II and the Third Reich. They don't list the last part in their annual stock report. This is Jeroen Schiller, one of Hensel's leading biotech engineers. He lives in Berlin. We've been in communication with him. The news is that Hensel has perfected a vaccine against biological weapons. Schiller has that information. He wants to make a trade. What does he want in exchange? Safe passage to the US. He lives in Berlin. He can take a cab to the airport. Germany's not the problem. Hensel is. Anyone who has top-level clearance is closely surveilled. Your job is to ID Schiller, get him away from Hensel and into the US. - What kind of extraction? - Shipment. Hensel is upgrading their intranet with fibre optics. You go in as a Rhine-Kom network supervisor. Unfortunately, this is the last documented photo of Schiller. University of Hamburg, 1975. We had Tech do an age processing to show what he might look like today. You'll find it in there. Marshall, go. Right. Thank you. How is everyone? Hello. Hope everyone's planning an enjoyable All Hallow's Eve. - Marshall? - Sorry. This is pretty incredible. Business card. Something you might hand out. Like, "Hello, I'm a Rhine-Kom net supervisor." In German, of course. English would give you away. But the genius, the achievement, is this. Even Sony would be like, "Well, Marshall, this is pretty cool." What does it do? You place the card on top of his monitor. A tiny transmitter inside will override the CPU and make the network think that you are the system administrator. You'll manually override the firewall and Schiller will transfer the formula to a Canadian website. We'll get the password once Schiller's here. - So I got your voice mail. - Don't feel obligated. No. I asked Diane. We're coming. All of us. - You don't have to wear a costume. - You didn't need to say that. Sydney. - Could I have a minute? - Of course. See you at Op Tech. I... We were closing a deal last Thursday. I couldn't get away. You said that when you called. It's fine. This is an especially busy time for me. There are six cases I'm overseeing. So, until things slow down, we probably shouldn't make any plans. I wasn't going to pursue it. - I just wanted it clarified. - Good. This is Paul Kelvin. Sydney Bristow. - I know your father. - Really? I hear that a lot. We gotta move fast. The CIA's watched Hensel Corp for years. They're not creating a vaccine? They are, but the US Army has been doing research that we thought was years ahead of the Germans. What are we afraid of? Schiller has developed micro-encapsulated cytokines. They activate your immune cells. Know anything about this? - A little. You? - A little. Enough to know that SD-6 could sell this vaccine to a radical leader who wants to protect his own people and start an all-out biological war. What am I supposed to do in Berlin? Instead of shipping Schiller, we'll ship Kelvin. He's prepped to impersonate Schiller. Based on available photographs, he's a good match. You'll make the switch in the building's garage. - You're up for this? - I'm not looking forward to it. What about when Sloane wants the vaccine? He'll give them false information. Kelvin's got a plane waiting. - See you in Berlin. - OK. - I've got to tell Dixon. - Absolutely not. How do I make a switch invisible to my partner? He'll be there. - You cannot tell him the truth. - You don't know him. - That's my point. - But I do. You might be right about Dixon, but you can't volunteer a man for double-agent duty if he hasn't asked for it. His whole life, his family. You'd be putting all of that at risk. You. Is that a decision that you want to make for him? I'm in. Copy that. All's quiet out front. Herr Schiller? You are the agent? Dixon, someone might be following me. Meet me at Eisenzahn at 7:00. Copy that. I'm starting the gas now. You'll have two minutes until people regain consciousness. - Dixon, I'm on Königstrasse - I'm on my way. When you asked me to help you, you didn't say all day. We're almost done. What's left that we haven't covered with corn? I work with a professional party planner. What's going on with work? You haven't mentioned it today. You want the truth? I wasn't working on a SAT story when I bumped into you guys. There is no SAT story. I was trying to track down a Kate Jones. Supposed to be seated next to Danny on a flight to Hong Kong. You can't do this. What was Danny doing on a flight to Hong Kong? Kate Jones and Danny were the only two people to miss that flight. I was at the medical school. I thought they'd have her name on file. Too many things don't make any sense. One of them is this woman. I looked up every Kate, Kathy, Katherine, Kathleen Jones in LA, plus I have a contact at the airport... You can't do this. Nothing is going to bring Danny back. When Sydney finds out what you've done, which you know she will... Just think about that. I want to see Mr Sloane. Mr Schiller, I've explained this. Sloane is not here. Tell us the password... I only talk to Sloane. That was the agreement. If you were who you say you are, you would know that. Mr Schiller, I swear to you. Sloane is a liar. He has nothing to do with the CIA. So you say Sloane is a fraud? How do I know it's not you who is the fraud? You don't. But you will. - How fast can we get to Langley? - Why? He wants proof we're CIA. He won't believe us unless we take him there. Vaughn, we're in. What's this? This is the main reason we made the switch in Berlin. We had Kelvin give Sloane access to a bogus website with enough real information to keep them occupied for months. - Is that worth risking a man's life? - There's more. Once SD-6 runs the program, we'll have a back door into their systems. In other words, we have access to their entire network. Files, contacts, accounts? This is a huge step in shutting down SD-6. - Nice. - It was Agent Vaughn's idea. - You look so surprised. - No. Yes, it was my idea. - Amazing idea. - Thank you. I know. - This is very exciting. - Go tell Analysis. It's good to finally meet you. The travel was not so easy, so forgive me for being so... No, not at all. We have $200,000 in cash waiting for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's yours, when you tell us, and we confirm, the location of the plant. Plant? Which plant? Where the prototype's being made. The vaccine inhaler. You do know the location of the plant? You see, I did not get information about any prototype. I was never privileged to such information. I have reason to believe you were. Why don't you think about it? Why don't you think about everything? How's Schiller? - I want to talk about your report. - Is something wrong? You wrote that Sydney changed the pickup to the rear exit. On Königstrasse. Was this decided before the extraction? - During. - Why? - Someone was following her. - Did you see someone? No, but I was outside the whole time. I see. If Sydney said there was someone following her, there was someone following her. Kenny. Trick or treat. There's more candy in there. Come on in. Good to see you. Sydney, can I talk to you for a second? What's up? Syd, we've been working together a lot of years. I trust you. - I trust you and I love you. - I know. If something's up, you'd tell me? - What are you saying? - Sloane is asking about Berlin. He thinks someone got to Schiller, that he's a plant. He wanted to know why you had me change the pickup. I told you I thought I was being followed. Syd, is there something I should know? No. Sloane says there's a prototype. An inhaler for the vaccine. He wants us to get it but Schiller won't give the location which makes no sense. That man should know where it is and has everything to lose by not telling us. - What's going to happen to him? - I think Schiller is in trouble. But, Syd... ...I think you are, too. Here's my question. Who eats this crap? It's like marzipan, but worse. If it was this or dirt, I would be all over the dirt. Would you shut up about the candy corn? OK. You're bummed that the kid came and Charlie didn't. What? You gave me advice. I took it. - Now it's my turn. - What advice did I give you? The Kate Jones thing. I'm giving it up. It can only end badly. So, it's my turn to give you some. You love Charlie. You don't want to lose him, so don't be an idiot. You gotta talk to him. Don't deny it. Don't piss me off. That's exactly what I did when I first met Sydney. OK? So use me as a cautionary tale and call Charlie. Yeah, Will Tippin. Hi, this is Kate Jones. You called me? Yeah. Did you know a guy named Daniel Hecht? Yes, I did. Very well. - Don't go to Langley. - We go in an hour. Kelvin could be dead by then. Sloane wants more than the password. Information Schiller would have. This could be it. If this goes badly, they'll know I'm a double. - What the hell do we do? - That's why I came here. I need to talk to Schiller right now. I wouldn't have called unless I had no choice. It's alright. What is it? There's a CIA officer, Paul Kelvin. Yes, I know about Berlin. Paul's a friend. Then you should know his life's in danger. He's in custody. Sloane wants intel Kelvin doesn't have. I have what Kelvin needs, but I can't get it to him. Sloane's already too suspicious of me. - But since he trusts you... - Sloane put a call in to me. - That must be why. - Why would he call you? He finds me useful in difficult situations. I'm surprised you're not with Emily. I would be, but we have a problem. Schiller won't talk. I don't trust that man, so I want proof. - Proof? - That he's telling us everything. That he is who he says he is. I understand. Arvin Sloane is not affiliated with the United States government. He's just a man... ...who used me, the same as he was going to use you. He made me think I was giving myself to God and country. But it was all a lie. A lie that cost my fiancé his life. If I go back to SD-6 without the location of that plant... ...they will take the life of another innocent man. I need to prove you're Schiller and I'm SD-6. I have to hurt you. There's only one person who can stop that. And I'm talking to him right now. Mr Schiller. Please. It's Badenweiler. The plant is in Badenweiler. The plant is located in Badenweiler, near the Black Forest. Badenweiler. It's in Badenweiler. Sloane called us in this morning. Our mission is to go to Badenweiler tonight, steal the vaccine inhalers and blow up the plant. I don't know how much longer I can do this. Sit in these meetings with Sloane, look at him as if I don't despise him, don't want to leap across the table and use the skills I've learned at SD-6 against him. So what the hell do I do next? What's my countermission? - He practically apologised. - Sloane did? For thinking I'd mailed him the wrong guy. Imagine that. Your reward is destroying the Badenweiler plant? Sloane says Hensel's producing supplies for neo-Nazi terrorists. Such a load. Sloane wants the vaccine tech. Why? He thinks he has the formula. It took Hensel five years to go to prototype. Sloane wants to skip that step. - How's Kelvin? - Home with his family. Arm in a cast. He'll be fine. - What about Schiller? - On his way to the Mid West with 200,000 grand of Sloane's money. - Of all of us, he's the luckiest. - That's for sure. What's my counter? Break into the building. Dixon sets the explosives. You retrieve the inhaler and rendezvous with the CIA team which will be inside the building. They will switch the inhaler. By then, Dixon should have exited the building. You disable the explosive. The CIA team searches the main computer system. You'll just steal their files? This isn't sanctioned research. Langley wants to know what Hensel is up to. I get out with the inhalers, Dixon tries to blow the charge. - Nothing happens. - Security's on their way. - We can't get back in. - That's the plan. You alright? What do you know about case 332L? There's some missing pages in my father's personnel file, and references to case 332L. And Agent Calder. - You read that, too? - Yeah. It sparked my curiosity. I went to Records to retrieve the file. It was missing. No record of it anywhere. There's one more thing. Calder wasn't CIA. He was FBI. Why would the FBI be working with my father? They wouldn't. Unless they suspected him of selling secrets. Yeah. To Hancock Park Homeowners' Association meeting. No, after county records. You know what? I'm on my cell. You're breaking up. Can't hear. Yeah, Will Tippin. Escorza, what's up, man? No, I didn't get a fax. Are you sure it was Kate Jones? Where was she headed? Sao Paulo? Her social security number? Give me her number. What? Let's go. - I'm going for the inhaler. - I'll see you outside in ten. - Mr Tippin? - Yes. I'm Kate Jones. Forgive me if I ask you anything too intrusive. - It's sort of my job. - It's OK. Can you tell me what your relationship was with Daniel Hecht? Miss Jones? Danny and I were having an affair. - Sorry I'm late. - Not at all. Let's see what you got. These are 45s? I need three of 'em. - So you're Bristow? - Yeah. Vaughn's told me about you. He likes you. He respects you. - I've got a bomb to disengage. - Please. We'd appreciate it. We'll be about ten more minutes. I twisted my ankle and went to University Hospital. Danny treated me and he asked me out. - Danny asked you out? - Yeah. I knew he was seeing someone, but I wasn't really thinking so much about her. Syd, come on. We talked about going to Hong Kong together. At the last minute, he broke it off. That's all it was, really. One of those relationships that just happen until they don't. I see. Anything else that you wanna know? Yeah, actually, there is one more thing. I have a contact who tracked your credit card from another one of your flights out of LAX. From that, they got your social security number. I did a trace on it. Here's what doesn't make any sense. Kate Jones, you died in 1973. I have to go. Who are you? Who the hell are you? - Got 'em. - Is everyone out? We're good. Come on, we gotta go. Dixon, we don't have time to go back. What are you doing? I brought a secondary detonator, in case there was a frequency jam, like in Peru. Did you get the inhalers? Good to go? Let's go.
