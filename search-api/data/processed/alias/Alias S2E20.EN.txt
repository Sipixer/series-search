I'll see you at home after I get the kids. - Good night. - Good night, Diane. See you tomorrow. Where the hell's the device? Tell me or we both die. Who are you? You're crazy. - Dixon, what are you doing? - I don't know what you're talking about. Stay back, Sydney. - No way. You're gonna kill yourself. - I have nothing to lose. What the hell is your man doing? Agent Dixon, disarm your explosive immediately. - Can you see them from your position? - Negative. Dixon, think. Don't do this. - Sydney, get outta here. - I'm not leaving without you. Dixon, I repeat, deactivate that weapon. Tell me where the box is or we die. - Base camp. Got a visual. - Tell me. What's it gonna be? Tell Vaughn to take him down. Dixon may be holding a manual detonator. Firing at him could trigger the explosion. - Dixon, shut it down. - 15... 14... Agent Bristow, I'm pulling rank. Agent Vaughn, this is NSA Deputy Director Brandon. I am ordering you to take that shot at first possible opportunity. - Sydney, get outta here. - Dixon, you must disarm now. Do not stand at my grave and weep I am not there, I do not sleep I am a thousand winds that flow... Should I say something? I am the gentle autumn's rain I am the swift uplifting rush Of quiet birds in circled flight OK, come on. Come on. Do not stand at my grave and cry Do not stand at my grave and cry - I saw Dixon take something. - What do you mean? Pills, uh... He just looked like he was barely holding it together. - It could've been aspirin. - It wasn't aspirin. What are you saying? I'm saying that he's going back to work days after his wife was murdered and he's self-medicating. I think he needs to feel like he's doing everything he can. To find Sloane. I had the same thing with Danny. Found the man we're looking for. He lives in Panama City. I can be there in 17 hours. No. The CIA has a copy of the database that Caplan decrypted. They'll deduce who it is we're after, if they haven't already done it. Well, what do you suggest? I suggest you call this number. A recording will answer for a limousine service. You will leave your cell number only. Within five minutes a man will call you. You tell him exactly what you need. Have you heard from Irina? She's in Cyprus. Inspecting some properties to take the place of the facility in Spain. I see. I thought I would have some measure of satisfaction with Diane Dixon's death. I killed the wrong person. Dixon. I'm taking a leave. I want you to continue without me. Sir, not to belittle your grief, but do not deny yourself the victory of a 30-year pursuit. If I don't see you again, Mr Sark, tell Irina that I hope you both succeed where I couldn't. This is Frederick Brandon, NSA Deputy Director. He's coordinating an interagency task force to locate and study Rambaldi's work. First of all, I'd like to say thank you to all of you for welcoming my associate and I. I'm Carrie Bowman, Special Projects. Well, thanks to your technical services specialist - it's a Mr Flinkman - we've made an invaluable breakthrough in the Rambaldi investigation. Really? Actually, I'm Flinkman. Marshall Flinkman. Hi. Hi. So, while the CIA was in possession of Rambaldi's study of the human heart, Mr Flinkman catalogued and copied it. Do you have that presentation? Oh, uh... Presentation... And, by the way... You can call me Marshall. Everybody calls me... Whatever. Um... OK, uh... Thing we got, uh, right here... Now, these drawings are amazing. Like, da-Vinci-in-his-prime amazing. But the "What could he possibly have been smoking?" element, well, that is right here. Now, take a look in the corner. You see these little drawings in the corner of the pages? Now, they look just like normal squiggles or doodling, like you would do while you were on the phone, talking to... Although he probably wouldn't be on the phone because, you know, it's the 15th century, they didn't actually have phones yet. But, um... They are actually specific strands of DNA. Now, I strung them all together and I got a DNA fingerprint. The DNA of this man. Proteo Di Regno. Private citizen living in Panama City. He works as an art restorer. You're saying that 500 years ago Rambaldi drew the DNA profile of a man who's alive today? It gets even better. Di Regno's DNA profile was a code key. It let us decrypt page 94 of the Rambaldi manuscript. - What's on the page? - Times and dates. Each marking an apocalyptic event. September 7, 1812, Napoleon's bloodiest battle with the Russians. June 28, 1914, the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand started World War I. August 6, 1945, Hiroshima. The list goes on. There's a future date listed on the page. Isn't there? 48 hours from now. - What's the prediction? - The page doesn't say. It just gives a time. It's the equivalent of midnight, Eastern Standard Time. We're coordinating with local authorities in Panama City. When you find Di Regno, you'll escort him back here. Until the moment specified by Rambaldi has come and gone, by National Security directive, this operation centre is under the jurisdiction of NSA. You've talked to the neighbours. No one saw the person who might have done this. So far, Forensics hasn't found anything. No prints, nothing. - And you believe this wasn't a burglary. - No. Nothing was taken. Besides his heart. Look. Rambaldi. So why take his heart? I don't know. It looks like the fingertip from a latex glove. Must have torn off. I was able to enhance the partial print you sent me off the latex glove. There was a match. Guy's name is Emilio Vargas. He's a freelance assassin, specialising in interrogation and wet work. Clients include Russian Mafia, Triad, Japanese yakuza... - Any intel on where he operates from? - Well, there is an address in Guadalajara. Forward me everything you've got. - I have a request concerning Agent Dixon. - What is it? I know he's been through a lot and I know he wants to feel useful but, until he's had a psychological evaluation and it's cleared by Medical Services, I... I believe it's in his best interest, and ours, to remove him from field duty. I've worked with Agent Dixon for a dozen years. You've worked with him a month. If he feels ready to be in the field, I'm going to accord him that respect. Given his state of mind, do you think he's the right person to make that decision? - Yes. - Jack, he just lost his wife. With all due respect, why are you fighting me on this? I'm not required to justify my decisions to you, Agent Vaughn. However, I recruited Dixon into SD-6. I'm the man who sold him the lie he was working for the CIA. I introduced him to the man who killed his wife. I will not be the one to tell him he can't assist in Sloane's capture. Everything OK? Miss Bowman? Hey. Excuse me, I... Thank you. No problem. Is everything all right? It's Joni Mitchell. - Don't tell anyone, OK? - No, I... I shouldn't bring her to work. It just makes me fatalistic. Well, this work we're doing, it doesn't really help. Yeah. No kidding. Researching this prophecy, trying to predict what sort of disaster's gonna hit 36 hours from now, it makes me wanna throw up. Do you believe in this stuff? Rambaldi. His prophecy. I was raised more or less by agnostic parents. I mean, they were inordinately empirical. Logical to the point of foolishness, really. Like "Marshall, you must wear your sweater. It's 52 degrees outside." But I'm like "Mom, I'm not cold. I don't..." "Well, in this family, young man, we wear sweaters at 52 degrees." I mean, there were really no prophecies growing up. Or even Santa Claus, tooth fairies... So the short answer's no. Well, that's what I keep telling myself. To tell you the truth, I'm exhausted by the world. Everything. The... The evil and the rage and the darkness. The last thing I need is some 15th century dork telling me I got a day and a half to live. I understand. I mean, like, I have so much left to do. Right. Are you gay? Why? Is there someone you wanna set me up with? No. It's just every cute guy that I meet turns out to be gay. - I'm not stupid. I mean, I'm in Mensa. - Hold on. Not gay. I mean, I like men in a kind of manly, friend sort... How about sushi? I mean, because, when we're done with this job, after 36 hours, of course, assuming we're all still here, we could... Maybe we... You wanna get some sushi? Yeah, I... I would love that. Oh, and, um, Joni Mitchell... Doctor Barnett. This is Michael Vaughn. Do you have a minute? There's something I need to talk to you about. Mr Vargas. We come referred by Gurneyev. He was very pleased with the work you did for him in Gdansk. The Kopernik job. No. Janazek. Janazek was a learning experience. I found if you remove the eye slowly, you can keep it connected to the optic nerve. He saw himself in a whole new light. - Why did you kill Di Regno? - Son of a bitch. Why Di Regno? Why'd you kill him? Why'd you take his heart? Talk. You son of a bitch. It wasn't his heart. It wasn't his heart. It was a machine. Where is it? On a truck. On its way to Colombia. Cartagena. Oh, God. - Is that where Sloane is? - Who? - Is that where Sloane is? - Who? - Sloane. Where is he? - I don't know Sloane. - The guy who hired you. - I was hired by phone. - How? How'd he pay you? - Wire... wire transfer. - Tell me how to find Sloane. - Dixon. Dixon. I asked you to come in because I wanted to know how you were doing, during what has to be a most difficult time. I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you. Do you mind if we talk about the operation yesterday in Guadalajara? No. Of course not. This was four days after the death of your wife. That's correct. - Were you ordered on this mission? - No. I was encouraged not to go. I insisted. Why? Because I have unfinished business. With Sloane. It says here that you and Agent Bristow interrogated an associate of Sloane's. That's right. Was that difficult? Being in the same room with someone who might know the whereabouts of the man who killed your wife. - He didn't know. - Did you ask him? Did Agent Bristow talk to you? Would she tell me something different? I used necessary force. There are people at this agency who are working to bring Sloane to justice. Not good enough. - I need to be involved. - Agent Dixon. It is my job to determine whether, at this time, you are fit for duty. Well, I reviewed his medical records and Di Regno never had a heart transplant. Nor did he have an artificial heart. I'm sorry. You...? Which leads us to at least two disconcerting questions. What in God's name was keeping him alive and why did Sloane want it so badly? There's more. Now, remember those heart drawings that he did? Well, I interpreted the text, and Rambaldi refers to conquering tissue degeneration. We know Rambaldi was fascinated with immortality. Yeah, but even so, what does this possibly have to do with the doomsday prophecy? 23 hours left. The satellites are tracking the truck. We should get something soon. Actually, this probably has no connection at all, but Di Regno worked as an art restorer. Now, Carrie reminded me. Hitler was a painter. - "Carrie"? - What? Oh, did I...? Um... Miss Bowman. I should go. Syd. Did you tell Barnett that I wasn't fit for field duty? Dixon, no. You didn't put in a request for me to undergo an eval? I promise you, no. Somebody did. I've been ordered to report to Medical Services for a drug test. You're worried. I've been taking Vicodin. Now, I stopped. I threw them away. But it doesn't matter, it'll show up on the test. Sydney. They're gonna suspend me. We've ID'd the truck. It just crossed the border from Panama into Colombia. Your father's developing an op to intercept Di Regno's heart. Did you report to Barnett that Dixon was taking pills? Yes. Come here. You should have called me first. Well, I'm sorry I didn't, but I don't need your permission to do my job. Why go out of your way to make things harder for him? I'm trying to protect him. And you. One mistake could get you killed. Dixon has saved my life more times than I can count. - He nearly beat a man to death. - He got us a lead on the Di Regno device. Look, I get that you both have a personal stake in catching Sloane. But it can also cloud your judgement. It makes me insane when you patronise me. This conversation's over. I stand by my decision. Shall we continue? I would like to cross the north summit. You did not tell me this when you hired me. If I had, you wouldn't have come. I will gladly pay you double the amount we discussed. No. People that go there do not return the same. I see. Well... Don't worry about me. I wanted to say I'm sorry. You caught me off guard. I'm sorry. I know you're just looking out for Dixon. And me. His test came back negative. You were right. Must have been aspirin. Are we OK? Yeah. Good. I hope I didn't wake the kids. They're at Diane's sister's. You passed the drug test. I'm in trouble, Syd. What did you do? Switch the results? As soon as I left the building, I knew it was a mistake. - Oh, Dixon. - But it was too late. - Oh, my God. - The results were already catalogued. Sloane murdered my wife. I have to make him pay for that. I've been called in to talk to Barnett. - You can't tell her. - Dixon... If they find out I doctored my test, I'll never work for the government again. How will I take care of my kids? Sydney... I don't know how to do this without Diane. I have to go. Syd. Thanks for coming in so late, but I was about to finish my evaluation on Marcus Dixon, and I didn't feel that it would be comprehensive without getting some input from the person who knows him best. What would you like to know? Your father has argued strongly that Dixon should stay in the field. And without any evidence of drug use, I can't countermand him. Is there anything that you think that I should know, before I give my final decision? Marcus Dixon is one of the strongest people I've ever known. I trust him with my life, without hesitation. And I am confident that, despite the agony he's feeling right now, he will pull through this. Hey. - Hey. - I got your message. The truck left the Pan-American Highway toward Cartagena. It looks like its end point is the Estrella shipyard. - We're going in with Delta Force. - What about Dixon? I left word right after I called you. He hasn't called me back. This is the Estrella. A cargo-freight area with its own security. The perimeter has patrols covering both the north and southeast sectors. Intel indicates the truck is located here, Sydney. You'll infiltrate the weakest post and secure it. Vaughn and Delta Force will then join you on board to determine whether or not this heart is actually a weapon, an explosive. By the time you reach the truck, you'll only have 20 minutes till the midnight deadline. If you're unable to locate the Rambaldi device, I've been given authority to initiate secondary protocol, to rig the yard with enough C-4 to destroy whatever the device may be. - You're late. - Sorry, sir. Fill him in on the way. You leave in an hour. - Could you give us a minute? - Sure. - I'll see you in Tech Services. - OK. Thank you for not saying anything. It wasn't just Barnett. I lied to Vaughn. Sydney. I need you to look me in the eye and promise me that you can handle this. I promise. OK. Let's go. Do you know who I am? Do you? - Arvin Sloane. - That's right, you son of a bitch. Your search for Rambaldi has frustrated you. Frustrated me? You mean that meaningless quest that you sent me on 30 years ago? That made me abandon the CIA and betray everyone I ever loved. Your wife has been killed. How did you know that? Put away the gun. There is something I must show you. We found the truck. No sign of the driver. I'm going to look for the device. Copy, Mountaineer. Base Camp, waiting on your signal. Copy that, Boy Scout. Hold your position. Cover me. It's not here. It's already been moved. We have to search every container. You do not have time. Initiate secondary protocol. Not yet. We'll give Sydney as much time as we can to find the device. At least move your team into place. - Boy Scout, weapons free. Move out. - Copy. - Did you secure the freight? - Yeah. - Who the hell are you? - CIA. You just took possession of a cargo coming from Panama City. Where is it? No idea what you're talking about. Where is it? Maybe they didn't tell you, but it could be a weapon of mass destruction. Piss off. OK. OK. You see this? There's enough C-4 here to blow us all to hell. Where the hell's the device? - Dixon, what are you doing? - Stay back, Sydney. - No way. You're gonna kill yourself. - I have nothing to lose. What the hell is your man doing? Agent Dixon, disarm your explosive immediately. - Can you see them from your position? - Negative. Dixon, think. Don't do this. - Sydney, get outta here. - I'm not leaving without you. - Dixon, I repeat, deactivate that weapon. - Tell me where the box is or we die. - Base Camp. Got a visual. - What's it gonna be? Tell Vaughn to take him down. Dixon may be holding a manual detonator. Firing at him could trigger the explosion. 15... 14... Agent Bristow, I'm pulling rank. Agent Vaughn, this is NSA Deputy Director Brandon. I am ordering you to take that shot at first possible opportunity. Sydney, please, go. What's it gonna be? Tell me. OK. Container 246B. Now shut it off. Shut it off, shut it off. I cut the primer cord. I'm not that desperate. - We've got a device. - Two minutes, 40 seconds to midnight. 30 years ago, I could only tell you so much. Information had to come to you over time. Or you would not have understood. Certain events needed to unfold, according to Rambaldi's writings. Your wife's death, though unfortunate, was a necessary step on your journey. You knew my wife was going to die. And you didn't warn me. If I had, I could not have given you this. No sign of radioactivity. The device is self-contained. Not hard-wired to the case. Do I have authorisation to open it? - 19 seconds. - Open the box, Delta leader. You can always choose to ignore it. - I've opened the box. - Can you deactivate it? Negative. - It's not a bomb. - What is it? Don't answer that, Delta leader. You seal the box, bring it home. Sir, it's Delta leader. It's all clear. We're packing up. I guess Rambaldi was wrong. Your jurisdiction just expired. I'll have a jet standing by to take you back to Washington. Now you understand. Your journey has just begun. Last night, asking you to lie for me. I'm sorry I ever put you in that position. It's OK. After you left... I got in my car, drove to this bridge I know. I was standing there, looking up at the sky. Asking God for forgiveness for what I was about to do. And then I heard something. It's a baby crying. It's a baby crying. I didn't know where it was coming from, I was alone. And I started thinking about my babies. I could see them. I saw them. In the crib. I saw us sitting up with them at night when they were sick. And so I stepped down off the railing. I looked up, and it wasn't a baby that was crying. It was just a tree branch bending in the wind. You're all I need to get by You're all I need to get by You're all I need to get by Long as I got you then, baby, you know that you got me, oh Can I have a bite? Dixon's gonna be OK. He admitted what he did, he turned himself in. That matters to Personnel. Vaughn, I knew what he did. I knew that he changed his results. And I didn't say anything to Barnett. Or you. You know this, but my parents were absent when I was growing up. I never had anyone to disappoint. That's different now. I'm sorry. You're all I need Whoa whoa You're all I need Whoa whoa You're all I need,
