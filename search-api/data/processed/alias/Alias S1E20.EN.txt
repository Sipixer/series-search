I was sworn to secrecy, but I couldn't keep it from my fianc√©. When the head of SD-6 found out, he had him killed. That's when I learned the truth. SD-6 is not part of the CIA. I'd been working for the people I thought I was fighting. I went to the only place that could help me take them down. Now I'm a double agent for the CIA. My handler is Michael Vaughn. Only one other person knows what I do, another double agent inside SD-6. Someone I hardly know. My father. - Do you value your life? - Of course I value my life. Your actions would indicate otherwise. Listen, Jean, this business we have to discuss is extremely sensitive. What is it? I know this has been difficult for Arvin. My illness. I look just like everyone else, and I usually feel that way. The fact is... I won't be alive next Christmas. Remember the vial of liquid that Khasinau wanted? We used it on the blank page. It exposed Rambaldi's hidden text. I've booked you on a flight for tomorrow night. - It'll be our last mission. - Noah... Let me prove to you that it can work. I heard about Noah. I'm sorry. Hit the bag. I killed a man. Someone I cared about. He was an assassin. If you hadn't killed him, he'd have killed you. Maybe. But I was the one who forced the fight. Hicks was a bad guy. That's it. Push. Nice combination. But the truth is, it affects me, never knowing who to trust. Learning to expect betrayal, plotting and secrecy and hatred and anger. It's becoming a part of me. I am becoming what I despise. I tell myself that I got into this to bring Danny's killers to justice. The truth is I'm more interested in revenge. I thought I could stay in control. It's just gotten so twisted, like with Khasinau. The one goal I have is to find him, so that I can find my mother. But if I do that, if I can find his trail and track him down, it'll strengthen SD-6. I got into this to bring them down, and now I feel like I'm on their side. This is the world of SD-6 when we started, remember? And here is what it looks like today. And this doesn't even take into account Badenweiler, or stealing page 47 from Sloane's vault, or the way you kept Khasinau from getting that ampoule. These are incredible accomplishments. Khasinau is out there somewhere. - Yes. - My mom is out there. We will find them. I have to go to class. Wait. Take care of yourself. Thanks. - Where was it? - Behind the fridge. - You say you saw it? - No, I heard it scratching. I'll go and get some traps. No. We need a professional. A hit man. Rats breed hourly. Hello? You disappoint me, Mr Tippin. It's Litvack. You have enough to publish. You have nothing to fear. I was kidnapped. The lives of people I care about were threatened. It's a bluff, to scare you off the story. It worked. I'm off it. Just go away. Don't call me again. Don't call anyone else again, unless you want more people to die. - It was Jack Bristow. - What? What was Jack Bristow? Hello? - We have rats. - What? In all likelihood. Possibly mice. Hi. Hi. - Mice isn't better than rats. - They're rats, and they're huge. The exterminator's coming. Could you be here? - No. I've got work. - I have to cater a lunch for 30. - I don't live here. - Why are you here? - You don't pay any rent. - Is this attack on Will? Please, just do this for us. OK, fine. I'll do it. Rats are clever. You have to out-think 'em. You can't just leave out cheese. You have to leave stuff they want. It's the only way they'll come out. Otherwise you're wasting your time. I can't believe I didn't think of this before. - We can make Khasinau come to us. - What are you thinking? - The vial. The Rambaldi solution. - The one the CIA has? That's why he had a team break into SD-6. He wants that solution. With respect to Khasinau, I'd like to suggest a course of action. Quickly. I'm got a meeting with the review team from NIC. Remember the ampoule we got from SD-6 that allowed us to read page 47? I suggest a black-market sale, third party. Khasinau still thinks that vial is in the SD-6 vault. So we say there's another one. Can we make him believe that? Have to make it sound legit. I know how. Last year Sloane sent a team of agents into the art museum in Algiers, after a minister donated a collection that Sloane believed might contain Rambaldi artefacts. - Why don't I know about this? - The mission failed. The agents were caught. Before they could even be questioned, SD-6 had them killed. Say there was a break-in at that museum this week. It would be widely publicised. Khasinau would start to hear rumours of what was taken. Including rumours of an existing second ampoule. Are you suggesting I approve of theft? We'd just be borrowing them. We'd return everything we steal after we make contact with Khasinau. The whole point is to get noticed. We? You're proposing to go with her? I know I'm not a field agent, but Agent Bristow will need back-up. She trusts me. We plan to go in as insurance agents, offering to lower their premiums. We'd inspect the security system before we commit any coverage. I downloaded the mission specs. Alarm types at the museum, activation points, blueprints, everything. This is our best shot at Khasinau. Do it. - You'll deal with the op tech? - I'll take care of it. I have to stop by the hospital. Emily, she's not doing well. Sick from the chemo. We heard that from the bug in Sloane's study. I'm sorry. Thanks. Could I get the number for Druzinsky's Pest Control? It's D-R-U... Let me just get a pen. Hold on just a minute. Go. 323... Naturally, the guy shows up. Sorry. How are you doing? Where's the problem? We've got rats over here, behind the refrigerator. Let me see your rats. Gnawed wood. Droppings. These are rat droppings. Kiill 'em, please. You got kids? No. Household pets? Dogs? Cats? Hello? What? No, I don't have any pets. Then I'd skip traps and go right to baiting. This will be your only warning. Sydney. I don't know if you feel well enough to eat these, but total contraband. Thank you. I'm so sorry you have to go through this. Sydney, tell me something happy. Happy? I've got the week off from work. Which is nothing, considering your husband owes me 50 comp days. I've been working really hard lately. - Can I give you some advice? - Please. When you look back, family, your friends, that's what matters. Work, your job, it won't seem that important. Even your job. Even working for SD-6. I know you can't talk about it. I wouldn't have mentioned it, but... I know how easy it is to lose perspective on things. And I don't wanna see that happen to you. When did Arvin tell you? He didn't. Over the years I'd overhear things, find clues that he never really left the world of intelligence. And I know he keeps me from the truth to protect me. To keep me from worrying. My only regret is not being able to tell him how proud I am. - I'm good for two minutes. - It's Emily. She knows about SD-6. - I'm just worried... - I know. It's too late. Your conversation was recorded. - The Alliance knows? - Yes. And? Information about SD-6 must be treated like a virus. There is only one response. Containment. What did she say? Sloane won't let them kill Emily. A decision won't be made until Sloane meets the head of Alliance security. He's the only one who can save her now. The time off I asked for last week, I'd still like to take it. Would that be alright? - Where are you going? - The desert. Yeah. Of course. Thank you. The desert. We need to test your security system. See how it operates during a shutdown of your generator, heating, electrical and ventilation systems. Once we're in, you inspect the alarm and exhibition space. I'll handle the shutdown with this frequency jammer. It'll keep the cameras off for three minutes. 180 seconds is all you've got. Shut down the primary generator. He says the generator's always kept the security monitors online before. When I close the ventilation system... The turbines and shaft shut down, allowing me access to the vault room. Now shut down the ventilation. Take the heating system offline. The vault room is located through a shaft on the east wall, 67 feet below the main level. According to the documents, the vault is a third generation Hanvalova. Careful. It's full of explosives, in case this doesn't work. This should crack the safe and short the circuit for two minutes, giving you time to get back to the main level before the alarms go off. And electrical. - What's going on? - I agreed to a systems analysis. Mr Algosaibi's president of the museum. - Not to a shutdown. - We are testing the system. - Everything is OK. - He's ordered the power restored. My partner and I flew in from Paris because we were assured we could make competitive offer. We must run a thorough analysis. When it's offline, essential services go down, including fire protection. That is a risk I cannot take. I will file a formal complaint with the legal department. Take him. Find his partner. Show them the way out. - What's going on? - We're being kicked out. I didn't finish my analysis. Did you? Barely. - Give me more details than that. - No details. You were kidnapped by a man who turns out to be someone you know's father? - What is this? - An article I've written. Do this for me. Keep it sealed and don't mention this to anyone. Don't open it unless something happens to me. If something happens to me, you gotta publish it. Why would something happen? Because I'm gonna go see my kidnapper. You've become insane! I can write a story that might raise questions, but it won't put him away. Publish it. That's your insurance policy. Then I'll never get his cooperation. There's gotta be some bigger story. I wanna find out what it is. Abby, you've gotta promise me you're not gonna open it. Promise me I won't have to. There are a few things we need to talk about. And you scare me, so I'd rather talk about them in a public place. Can I have a beer, please? You want to talk to me? About what? Let's start with Sydney. Does she know? I don't know what you're talking about. Does she know that you kidnapped me? I think you have me confused with someone else. Thanks. No, I don't. I wrote a story. No one's seen it yet. But if I die, it's gonna get published. It's a story I don't even wanna work on any more. - Will, you seem very upset. - I am. Cos it won't go away. This source, who told me about you, won't let it. I don't even know where he lives or works. So you can't beat it out of me, but he knows. He knows everything. He gives me hints and clues, and he's never wrong. I don't know if you work for SD-6, or if you're responsible for the deaths of Daniel Hecht and Kurtz. I don't know if you're protecting Sydney, or if she needs protection. But tell me what you know. Convince me you put Sydney's interests first, that in some sick, bizarre twist of fate, you and I are on the same side. My concern for Sydney is not yours to judge. Convince me by helping me put a stop to what's going on. And in return I'll help you find out who my source is, because I got a feeling that he's somebody you'd like to meet. Thanks, Ethan. There's been a breach. Our entire operation could be compromised. - What's the source? - Best guess? A whistle-blower within the agency, with access to Omega-17 files. He's been talking to a reporter. Put counterintelligence on it. They should tart with Steven Haladki. - Haladki? - He fits the profile. Agent rising in rank, opposed to company policy regarding SD-6. Efforts to change policy thwarted, so he takes it out of the building. That's a big charge. The source is putting Sydney's life at risk. Haladki filed a report on the prophecy. You had him at gunpoint to find out if the bureau was holding Sydney. Yes. Then I used that information to hold other FBI agents at gunpoint in order to free her from a witch-hunt. - You need to get CI on this tonight. - I want you to stop. I hear your concerns and I'll choose how to respond to them myself. You're a good agent, but lately I find your methods reprehensible. If I hear of one more instance of you acting off-book, you're done. I sent flowers to Will to thank him for baby-sitting our rodents. What do you think the card should say? - I had sex with someone. - Seriously. What? When? About a week ago. - When were you gonna tell me? - I know. It was Noah Hicks. I know how you feel about Noah. - Did he just call you up? - No. It was a business trip. We just picked up where we left off. How is he? He is... It didn't end well. I'm not surprised. He was never good enough for you. Anybody who'd dump you like that doesn't deserve a second chance. - People change. - No, they don't. What if I started dating Charlie again? I know. You're really down about this. A little. There's nothing to be down about. It's over. I just wanted to let you know. Maybe you're right. Maybe I am being a little too tough on Noah. If he calls, I'll try and be nice. Get me the last profile on Edward Poole. Sure. Right away. It's a pop-up book. I'm making them. Clears my mind. Feel free to dock me any amount you feel is... Here. This is interesting. When he came in he was carrying two phones. - Can you locate them? - Yeah. - There. - Good. I have one phone number on Poole. I ran a tap on it but I couldn't find... any leads on Khasinau. I can probably track down the second one. Just get me the other number right now. Let me begin by saying I know how difficult this is. - If there was any other way... - My wife is dying. I understand. - She has lymphoma. - Yes. We have both video and audio. This isn't an issue of confirmation. No. This is an issue of decency. - The time and date have been set. - She is my wife. I am not just going to sit back and allow you to eliminate her. When I first came into the Alliance, my closest friend was Jean Briault. He took me into his confidence. He guided me. He was my mentor. But when Briault was murdered at point-blank range, I didn't ask any questions. I didn't talk of decency. Jean Briault was my friend too. His murder was a tragedy. I'm just trying to prevent another. The Alliance knows you disregarded the policy and pursued Khasinau. They're going to want to see evidence that your priorities are in order. Are you suggesting I allow you to kill my wife to enhance my standing? Thanks. I work in intelligence. That is all you need to know. So the bank's a front company? We meet when and where I decide. Never contact me. When you say intelligence, you mean SD-6. It's some off-the-books... We go after the source first. Everything else comes later. Clear? Does Sydney know? Jack, is your daughter a part of this? No, she's not. - Now, are we clear? - Yes. Do you have a way of contacting your source? I have a transmitter. It's a pin. I found it in a box of stuff belonging to Eloise Kurtz. What? I planted that pin on Eloise Kurtz. Of course. Nevil said it was government issue. You hired her to play Kate Jones so she could lie to me. And when she said too much... - You had her killed! - I did not kill her. I bear some responsibility for her death, as do you. Focus, Mr Tippin! Do as I instruct, or more people will die. Why don't I contact Deep Throat and insist upon a meeting? He told you about me. He'll know it's a setup. Contact him. Tell him you know I kidnapped you and you are terrified. Then tell him you are back on the story. This meeting never took place. Edward Poole was a friend, a visitor to this office, a former operative with Ml6. Recently I was shocked to learn that he has become an ally of Khasinau. I asked Marshall to see if he can come up with any leads. Marshall? Thanks. This is really good. - You've seen the news? - Perfect, right? So far so good. - Have you contacted the broker? - I stopped in Lisbon. I said I was hired by the robbers. - Who? - Splinter group of the Raslak Jihad. - How much did you ask for? - 10 million. I gave him the SAT phone and told him to stick to our agreed window. Good. My father's disabled the SD-6 satcom intercept. There's no way Sloane can find out about this transaction. We've intercepted signals between Poole's phone and the com tower. From that we were able to set up a wire tap on his STU. Secure Telephone Unit. Then we were able to get Khasinau's number and run a tap on him. We heard from the broker. Mr Khasinau is willing to pay double our asking price in diamonds. - Is Khasinau gonna meet us? - No. He's sending Sark. This is a conversation picked up between Khasinau and Mr Sark. You'll recall the ampoule stolen from us on behalf of Khasinau. We believed there was only one ampoule in existence. This conversation indicates the existence of two. It says Sark and a splinter group of the Raslak Jihad have agreed on the number of men each side can bring to the meeting. Each side has one principal and two backups located in the market. If they bring two, we bring four. When you meet, you'll be able to test each other's merchandise, which is why we need to give him the real solution. After he confirms it's authentic, switch the vial with an identical one containing water and an isotope we can track via satellite. When Sark brings it to Khasinau, he'll be bringing us along as well. Our pursuit is incomplete without that ampoule. To recover it, you are authorised to use all necessary force. Understood? - Yes. - Good. You leave tonight. - Sark might've seen you in Moscow. - He won't recognise me this time. You saw what he did there. And in Hong Kong. If you're suggesting we bring someone else in, no way. This is my op. OK. We leave for Denpasar tonight. Hi. I don't know if you can hear me or not, but I've thought about it. I'm back on the story. Dr Richardson, report to nuclear medicine. Hi. How do you feel? Better... now that you're here. Dr Levin stopped by earlier. He said the biopsy's scheduled for next week. Sweetheart. It's gonna be OK. We have to believe that. Yeah. You are so beautiful. I know. I must look wonderful. Hold me. I am so proud of you. - What have you got? - Sark's in place. How many men? One inside and one at the gate next to one of ours. - He stuck to the plan. - So far. If anything changes, we're ready. After you test the merchandise and make the switch, go separate ways. We agreed that neither side would have the advantage. - That is the agreement. - You have not lived up to it. You can see me. I cannot see you. You know who I represent. According to the broker, you are affiliated with the Raslak Jihad. A noble cause, to be sure, and a group I respect for its dedication to the principles of ancient Kuntao. When I learned of this, I volunteered for the assignment. Because I'm quite familiar with the Kuntao use of the latajang. If you are who you claim to be, your skill with it should be unsurpassed. Sydney, stick to the plan. The agreement was clear. We meet and trade. We will, if you are who you say you are. Is he asking you to fight? I've told my guard to stand down. If you want the diamonds, do the same. Don't do this. Sydney! Sydney! - Excellent. - Let's test the merchandise. Let's. Sydney, it's Dixon. He's here. Both guards are down. I repeat, both guards are down. I am satisfied. Do we have a deal? He's at the gate. Make the switch. I repeat, make the switch. - Enough! Either we have a deal... - Yes, we have a deal.
