You brought the payment? I hope you like diamonds. They are planning an attack -- large scale. Civilian target. Where? I'm not sure, but it's on the hard drive. Everything you need. Your man is in Los Angeles? He's ready. Have him proceed to locker 471. I'm on the move. The combination is 8-02-37. Has he found it? I have the package. He's got it. On the next turn, spin me and cut into the nearest dancers. Pleasure dancing with you. Carrie, have you seen my shoe? I really need to go. - No, you don't. - Yes, I -- Uh... found it. Who put it in the box? Okay. Hey, Marshall... Okay, I'm out of here. He's warm. He's warm. - Doesn't he feel warm? - He just got out of the bath. No, it's not the bath. He's feverish. There's a temperature nozzle right by the sink. Looks like a pen. Just point it, and it'll tell you -- - Just feel him. Feel him. - He does feel a little warm. - Will you hold him? - I can't take him right now. Carrie -- Carrie -- Oh, boo-boo. Hold on a second. - Hello? - Where are you? Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Heatherington. It's Mr. Heatherington. Dixon's en route with the hard drive. You were supposed to be here an hour ago. Where are you? Well, you know, we had a bit of a domestic crisis here. I'm not interested. Get in here. Okay, abso-- I'll be right in, sir. Thank you, Mr. Boss...man. You can't go back in. I have to. The server crashed, okay? He needs to go to the doctor, Marshall. Well, then you take him. Listen, Carrie, I'm sorry. I need your help right now. Have to get to work, okay? Okay, boo-boo. My contact here indicated Third Faction is planning a large-scale civilian attack. We'll have the hard drive decrypted by the time you touch down. Just don't spend too much time sight-seeing in Cuba. Don't worry. I'm ready to get out of here. Do you have any idea how hard it is to maintain cover while dancing the salsa in 3-inch heels? Yes, actually, I do, but let's keep that between us. You're doing the next intel swap. I don't care what the parameters are. Oh, nothing would make me happier. I love dancing. You hate to dance. How do you know? I've never seen you dance. Well, I'm a mysterious man. There are a lot of things you don't know about me. You've never once taken me dancing. Okay, let's go dancing. - Really? - Yeah, sure. - But you hate dancing. - And yet I'm taking you. Like I said, I'm very mysterious. - You see your driver? - Yeah. Have a safe trip. Get down! I need a med tech! Attention, pathogen alert. This man is down! Attention, pathogen alert. I need some help here! Get back. Jeff, hand these out and make sure everyone gets one. You got it. Here. It's atropine. Vaughn! Don't touch him! Don't touch him! Let's get help. Come on. Here, inject yourself. Clear his airway. Dixon, it's all right. It's okay. It should start taking effect. It's working. Relax. Breathe. Schmuck, Alex? He was under the impression this was a negotiation. He was mistaken. Now I don't particularly care who you are and who you work with, but I'm sure your conspirators will have their hands full with the hard drive we sent you. Oh. All this is for them. I need him to see what I do to my enemies. I need him to see what I do to you. So would it help with your demonstration if I started crying and pleading for my life? You obviously don't understand your situation. He was my friend. You're not. I have something much worse planned for you. Yes, director. We'll keep you informed on the hour. Right. What's our status? Vents have been sealed, air filters are working, electricity shifted to backup generator. Our cover prevents local emergency responses from intervening. We'll have to wait for hazardous material team to give us a green light. Until then, proceed with quarantine protocol. When will the ICU be ready? Minutes. The hard drive Dixon brought in exploded after it was connected to A.P.O.'S network. It's possible our computer system has also been compromised. Right. Then we'll run an emergency diagnostic. Where's Marshall? Flinkman. Lockdown protocol 4-alpha-charlie. Confirm. Confirm! Yeah, sorry. 4-bravo-inkblot, confirm. Firewall networks are secure. We haven't been hacked. - Is this a drill? - Unfortunately not. A nerve agent was released inside A.P.O. We've neutralized the threat, but our exposure is still a biohazard outside the office. Until we get cleared, no one comes in or out of here. Okay, okay, I got it. Is there anything -- What can I do? What can I do? Nothing. Stay on the line. We'll tell you what we need. What the hell happened? We've been double-crossed. What about Sydney? She last checked in before x-fill. Have we confirmed the flight? Hello? Hel-- Sydney, is that you? Don't hook up the hard drive. We know. Where are you? I'm not sure. They... they dragged me to a cemetery and knocked me out, and I woke up in a coffin. Syd, are you... Have you been buried? Yes. Stay calm. We're going to find you. What about your contact? They shot him. He's in the coffin with me. We have CIA family support in Cuba. No, we don't. We're black ops. We're on our own. You guys have to come get me. Sydney, the hard drive has been rigged. It released some sort of a toxin in here. We're in lockdown. Lockdown? For how long? We estimate about 36 hours. Okay, what are our other options? Um, excuse me. I know you told me you would let me know if you needed anything, but I could do it. I could go to Cuba. Wait a minute. Marshall, you're -- you're not in lockdown with the rest of the team? No, Syd, listen. Mitchell -- this morning -- it's a long story. How many bars do you have on your cell phone? Four. Four. Okay, good. That's excellent. Every cell phone has a distinct radio frequency that's traceable. If we can get a locator -- But there's no way to get the op-tech to you. Well, I could rig one in country, okay? I mean, the only thing is, Syd, you would have to stay off the phone while I'm traveling. You know, just to conserve the battery. Done. We go with this. Marshall, there'll be a visa and a passport for you at the airport. Passport and visa. Passport -- okay. Okay, I'm going. Marshall, Sydney has a limited supply of oxygen in that coffin. We have no margin for error. Understood? Yeah. I understand. I can do this. - Sydney, I want -- - No, I get it. I'm hanging up now. Reports confirm that ten containers of cyclosarin were stolen a week ago from a warehouse in Morocco. They hit us with a drop. Less than a gram, according to lab analysis. Third Faction has enough toxin to infect an entire city. I want their target. Cross-check all D.I.A. and echelon watchlists. Consult with all of our contacts patrolling major ports. You know the protocol. How long has she been in the ground? Look at me! Marshall's on his way. We'll get Sydney out. Make no mistake. Third Faction wants us on our heels. They think they can bomb our operation. They think they can bury our agents alive. And they think that will stop us. Well, they're wrong. We have a job to do. Get to work. Uh...uh, uh, do you have a screwdriver? A flathead screwdriver, por favor? That can't be regular spanish. That's way too fast. Could you slow down, por favor? You know what? Never -- Hola. Cómo esta? All right, she's really starting to freak me out a little bit. Qué? Okay, uh, do you have, uh, a radio? You know... Un radio. Sí, sí. Un radio, radio. It's the same... in spanish. Ahh. Bueno. Uh... these your chickens? Bueno. Syd, slow down. Say that again. We can I.D. him. Who? Phantom. My contact. I can send you a picture. You can check it against airport surveillance, inbound flights to Cuba. He wasn't alone on it. Get visuals of the other members of Third Faction and... track that against... where they've been and where they're -- where they're going. Send the photo. Okay, Syd, we got it. We're indexing it now. Vaughn? Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me? I know what he looks like. Syd, we got the picture. We're working on it. We can check it against airport surveillance. Syd, you already said that. He wasn't alone. We can find where he's been, where he's going. Yeah? Marshall, what's your status? Well, it's really hot here and everyone keeps calling me "chango." Marshall, where are you? We're close. Really close. I've got her signal locked in. We don't have much time. I understand. Hold on. Okay. Okay, senor, turn here. Turn here, sir. Senor, aquí! Aquí! Sí, sí. I took a little spanish in college. Syd, Marshall's on his way. We'll be dancing before you know it. Yet my feet touch the ground. What was that? Sydney? Vaughn? My phone is dying. Vaughn? Okay, aquí. All right, Mr. Bristow, I'm here. I'm here at the cemetery. Hold on. Syd, Marshall's there. Hang on. I just -- I just need to... Find out which grave she's in. Syd! Sydney? Okay. Okay. Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no! No! No! Damn it. Vaughn? Vaughn? 4...5... 6...7. 7. There are 7 fresh graves here. Marshall, you don't have time to dig them all up. Is there any way to narrow it down? Wait a minute, wait a minute. Vaughn, can you task a satellite over my position? All right, I'm here. What do I do? Well, tasking a satellite from the NRO will take forever, so go to the config-dot-sys menu. My phone has GPS, so you should be able to route the coordinates through the system. Got it. Okay, now type kh-11-backslash-int-backslash- therm-backslash-config-dot-sys. Let me know when you're there. Hang on. I don't see a prompt. Well, there is no prompt. The prompt's implied. What, I'm supposed to just type it in? Yes, god, Vaughn, this isn't that hard. Well, I've never done this before. Well, I do it for you people all the time. Now come on. - Okay, I have a visual. - Okay, great, great, great. The commands I gave you should change the view to thermal. Okay, wait, I see her. Eight rows north from where you are, three graves west. North, west, okay. I'm on it. No, Marshall, stop. Turn around. Your other north. Okay, all right. That's it. It's right in front of you. I got it. I got it. Syd? Syd? Syd, can you hear me? I'm coming. Oh, my god. No. No. Syd? Syd? Syd? Syd? Syd? Syd? Syd? Oh, my god. Okay. 1, 2. Come on. Come on. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Syd? Oh, god. That's her. She's moving. Syd? You okay? - Marshall. - Yeah. - Thanks. - You're welcome. We have an I.D. on the phantom. Alex Rucker. High-tech specialist. He was recruited for the Third Faction by this man -- Ulrich Koture. That's him. The phantom says another chemical attack is eminent. The assumption is that Ulrich has the intel we need to stop it on his computer. Sydney, Marshall, A.P.O. is in lockdown for at least another 24 hours. Your mission is not over. This picture was taken 10 hours ago at a Berlin airport. Ulrich operates out of a nightclub there. Infiltrate the club. Find Ulrich's hard drive and upload its contents to us. Ulrich knows me. There's no way I can get close to him. But we could send in someone else. I've never been to Berlin. Make eye contact with everyone, particularly Ulrich's bodyguards. Why? You have to convince them you're not scared. Right. Yeah, I think you're supposed to do that in prison, too, I heard. The flash drive inside will automatically begin transfer when you're within range of his computer, but you have to get kind of close. - How close? - 2, 3 feet. Syd, this guy, he buried you alive. Yeah, but he cheated. He hit me with a car first. - Ordinary cell phone, right? - Right. Snap off the back. You've got your barrel, your trigger, magazine. - The magazine holds two bullets. - I know. - Be careful when you load it -- - Syd, I know. I built that, remember? I mean, I built all this stuff. - It's different in the field. - I know. So be careful when you load it, because this is very sensitive up here. Hold on a sec. It's Carrie. Hey, honey. Hi. What time is it? Oh. Sorry, uh, how's he doing? Is he okay? We didn't -- I mean, I didn't realize -- Oh, poor Mitchell. You know what? Put him on. Yeah, put him on. Did you try that thing where you -- Okay, yeah, put him on. Hey. Hey, boo-boo. Hi. Daddy loves you. Ahem. Hush, hush... Hush, little Mitchell, don't you cry daddy's gonna teach you about lanthanides cerium is first, yes, it leads the way hexagonal structure, and it's iron-gray praseodymium is next, and it looks like brass -- What? No, I can't make it home right now. I'm sor-- Tonight. I promise. By tonight. That's the best I can do. I'm sorry. Yes. Yes, Carrie, it's a crisis. Carrie -- I told her I'd be home tonight. You will. Okay. Here. Right. Wish me luck. Okay, I'm in. Now what do I do? What do you see? Well, a lot of people who are into spanking, apparently. Oh, my god, I think I just got hepatitis. What? This woman who looks like Marlene Dietrich, she just kissed me. I don't think she's in on it, though. - What are you talking about? - Nothing. Okay. I see a back office. There's bouncers standing guard and apparently a lot of men with guns. You can do this. Just remember what we talked about. Eye contact. Now walk up to them and repeat exactly what I tell you. Thank you. Okay. I'm, uh... here to see Ulrich. Ulrich not seeing anyone. Tell him Alex wasn't the only one betraying him. Tell him Alex wasn't the only one betraying him. Ulrich... This way. Thank you. Okay. Mr. Koture, thank you for taking the time to -- Stop. I don't know who you are, and you're distracting me at a critical juncture, so I hope you have something interesting to tell me, mr... Okay, this guy's a blowhard. Bristow. Jack Bristow. That's -- that's good. And if I'm wasting your time by being polite, I'm happy to walk out of here. Wait, don't go overboard. Just don't call me when the Third Faction goes down in flames. Don't mention Third Faction! You said you had information about my men. Now what is it? Marshall, I'm not getting a reading from the flash drive. Get the case closer to Ulrich's computer. - Cigarette? - No thanks. I have some... conversations on tape. Perfect. And just keep that going for two minutes. Tell him he's mentioned on the tapes. You're mentioned on those tapes. My men would never go to the government. No, but they would sell you out to the Slobodan Wolves. No, but they would sell you out to the Slobodan Wolf. - Wolves. - Wolves. So, who -- who's doing this? Dietrich Gustof, his third in command. Dietrich Gustof, your third in command. I'm confused by something. You say you have these recordings, and Dietrich, well, he only speaks german. So? Doesn't that mean... Okay, he just insulted you. Now say... I work for myself. And as for these tapes, it's none of your business how I got them. And my german... Now laugh like it's all a big joke. Uh, Syd, we've got a problem. What is it? The hard drive's connected to network firewall. Everything you're sending us is encrypted. But hold on. I'm checking all the computer shipments to your location. If we can figure out the system, we might be able to bypass it. All right, mr. Bristow. Bring me that tape, and we'll cut a deal. Marshall, we've hit a glitch. Stall. Okay, Syd, we've isolated the firewall. It's located in the basement of the club. - I'm on my way. - No, no, no. Wait, wait. The firewall is biometrically linked to Ulrich. You have to get him down there to disable it. Marshall, change of plans. The hard drive is encrypted. We need Ulrich in the basement to shut down a network firewall. I'm afraid we can't do that just yet. Nein? Is there some sort of problem? Marshall, you have a gun. Use it. Get him to the elevator. I'll meet you in the basement. You know what they say. Never discuss money on your first meeting. Well, I sort of need to settle on a fee first. We will negotiate that after I see what you have. Afraid I can't do that. Kind of a policy I have. Cash up front. Not really a policy, per se. More of a been burned by too many fly-by-night terrorists to trust them sort of thing. You know, one day they say "we'll pay you in gold," the next they say, "did we say gold? We meant --" Marshall, are you okay? Oh, my god. Syd, I think I just killed Ulrich. Syd! Syd, I need your help now. Hang in there. I'm on my way. What type of biometric scanner are they dealing with? Retinal. Marshall, can you hear me? Hey, Mr. Bristow. Listen, I'm really sorry. It was an accident. I didn't mean to shoot -- Marshall, we are going through with this mission. Look around. Do you see any sort of cutting tool? A knife of some sort, or -- No. Look on the desk. Is there a letter opener? Uh... Yeah. Got it. Why? You have to cut out Ulrich's eyes. Oh, my god. The biometric scanner in the basement operates off Ulrich's retinas. No. No, I -- You don't have time to get his body into the basement. Mr. Bristow, no, I can't do that. I'm sorry. Yes, you can. I can talk you through it. Okay. All right. I'm ready. Go ahead. You have to go under the eye and sever the optic nerve. - Okay. - Brace the head. The bundle is denser than you think it's going to be. All right. Here -- here we go. Oh, god, it's oozing. It's oozing everywhere, sir. That means you've ruptured the macula. The eye is useless. Abandon it. Approach the second one gently, like a soft boiled egg. You're going to need a digging instrument to assist with this. I got a spork. What's a spork? It's like a half spoon, half fork. Will that do? That will work. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Soft boiled egg. Soft... Done. Come on. Here, you do it. I can't look at it anymore. How much time do you need? 15 seconds. Marshall, it's working. I'm out. Syd. Got it. Okay, we've got a location on the bomb -- Hong Kong. I'm alerting the local CIA offices now. Sydney, are you and Marshall all right? We're fine. The ministry of security confirmed the seizure of a cyclosarin bomb in downtown Hong Kong. They have expressed their gratitude to Langley. Third Faction's operation extended far beyond our original estimate. The hard drive that Marshall downloaded contained hundreds of names of contacts throughout Europe and Asia, which we will have to confirm. Start with all arms-related activities. Don't limit your parameters to chemical weapons. So where are we? Third Faction had few political affiliations. Their primary interest was maximizing profit off of terrorist activities... These are not the clothes I left the house in. What do I tell Carrie? Maybe you had spare clothes at the office. I hate lying to her, Syd. Syd... I hate lying to Carrie. I know. Part of the job though, right? Well, you could tell her the truth -- That you had to cut out a man's eyes to save the world. Yeah. I could tell her that. Probably be best just to keep that between us. And I didn't save the world exactly. Just Hong Kong. You saved me. Yeah. All in a day's work. Anyway... you want to come in and get some dinner with us? Yeah, and how would we explain that I drove you home? I don't know, we could come up with something. We're quick on our feet. We're spies. Thank you, but... I need to go wait at the train station. There's someone I need to see. Yeah. I know the feeling. I'll see you tomorrow?
