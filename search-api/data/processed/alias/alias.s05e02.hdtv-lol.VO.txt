Vaughn may be a double agent. They think the crash may have been an extraction. Gordon Dean, Office of Special Investigations. My fiance was just abducted. Perhaps. That's what we're trying to determine. I want the truth. 7 years ago, a woman came to me, said that her father had been involved in a project, something that people had gone to great lengths to cover up. Said it was called Prophet Five. This man we're meeting, Renée and I have been trying to find him for years. Renée who? Who is this woman? - Renée Rienne. - Vaughn. The Raven, Renée Rienne. She's wanted for the assassination of the Turkish Interior Minister in 2001 and for the murders of 3 C.I.A. agents stationed in Serbia. Vaughn's movements track with hers. I am now officially classifying him a fugitive and your daughter an accomplice. You'll be notified when they've been apprehended. What on earth prompted you to risk your own life, not to mention your professional integrity? Dad, Vaughn and I, we're having a baby. I want to know about Prophet 5. It seemed to be some sort of advanced genetics 500 years ahead of its time. When they know you're onto it, they'll stop at nothing to silence you. You're a hard person to find. But if I can do it, so can they. I know who you are, Renée. It's no accident you found me here. The people who killed Vaughn... they own this place. There's an operation center in the back. I haven't gotten in yet, but judging the way that man over there is looking at us, you just blew my cover. You should go. - Walk out, slowly. - What about you? I didn't spend 3 months getting in the place to just walk away. We can access their servers. That might give me a window into their operation. I'm going there. I'm coming with you. You know the rules. You're not supposed to be back here. You're gonna want to step aside now. Sexy. So I'm bein' threatened by a waif and a pregnant chick. Feeling sexy now? Get up. The data's being destroyed. - I can't stop it. - Me, neither. We got it. It doesn't look like it's been fried. The data should still be intact. Probably encrypted. It won't be a problem. I don't know if Vaughn ever mentioned, but I work with a genius. He'll be able to crack the encryption. I'll upload it for you. Here, take this. It's a secure line. Dial 9, wait for the tone, dial 8-1-6. You're not bringing this back to the C.I.A. No, we're an off-the-books division. It's different. Not to me. I don't know them. I do. You can trust them. Who says I trust you? Good point. What did Michael tell you about me? Not that much. Just that you've been working with him for years, and you were the one who told him about Prophet 5. I understand why you're reluctant. I mean, you're number eight on the C.I.A.'S most wanted list. I get it, but you have to understand, these people killed my fiancé... the father of my child. I'm gonna enlist every resource available to immobilize them, and if that means that this is the last time you and I see each other, that is fine by me. Just... tell me how you wanna do it. - Number 8? - Yes. I'm slipping. I used to be number 6. You're exactly like Michael said you were. Fine. Do it your way. Give me the phone. You called him "Michael". Yeah. Don't worry. He was crazy about you. - How've you been feeling? - Oh, good. The morning sickness is gone, and my energy's back, so... Right on schedule. That's normal for the second trimester. How was your trip? London, right? Do any shopping? Oh, it was more of a business trip, actually. I had to meet with one of my fiancé's old friends. What about exercise, are you keeping active? My job is still pretty demanding. That's great. Doctors used to tell pregnant women to stay off their feet. You're pregnant. You're not sick. As long as you feel comfortable, you just keep doing what you're doing. Let's take a look, shall we? Should I ask the nurse to bring in anyone from the waiting room? No, I came alone. You know, Sydney... You should try. Okay, let's see how we're doing. And there we go. That's your baby. That's the head, the spine and that pulse... Look at its little heart. Mm-hmm. You got an active one there... just like mommy. Everything looks great. And I will see you in a few weeks. This is the man that killed Vaughn. His name is Ivan Curtis. He ran operations for a corporate security firm out of Dublin until 3 years ago when European Aviation records say he died in a private plane crash. It's starting to fit a pattern. Gordon Dean was presumed dead two years ago. Both of the men who we know were involved-- From what we've learned, their operation has been in place for 30 years without being detected. Whoever these people are, they must have access to high level resources. I'm leaving tonight for Washington. Ahern has some names for me to consider. Do you still think that's a good idea... bringing in a new agent now, someone we don't know? We're down a man, and I trust Ahern's recommendation without reservation. In the meantime, Curtis has been in London. Have Marshall create a facial profile so we can run him against their surveillance networks. So Sydney said she got this footage from a contact. What do we know about this person? She didn't say. - Yeah. Hello? - It's me. I've been going over the footage from London. I think I found something. Hmm. I'd love to, baby, but I'm married. Oh, Marshall, wake up. Marshall. I'm up. I'm up, I'm up. Sorry. Uh... Syd? I need you to pull up the surveillance footage from London. Okay, uh, gimme a sec. You been at this all night? Are you looking at the footage? Hold on. Gimme just a sec. Okay, now I am. What am I lookin' for? Time index 12-40. Curtis is dialing a number. - Can you enhance it? - See what I can do. That looks like a 4. That looks like a 3. No, it might be a 5. You know what? I'll run it against an Echelon call archive. I'll use the 5. I've got the audio. Patching it through. They're ordering takeout, Marshall. Right. Sorry. Must be the 3. All right, got audio. Patching it through. - Allo? - Any news on my package? Not yet. I'm still workin' on it. I'm growing impatient. If this is becoming a problem for you... I haven't disappointed you yet, have I? 25 more kilos. I'll have it for you. Fine. I'll be there to pick it up. Don't let me down. Looks like we got our guy. Who was Curtis talking to? Can you run a trace? Yeah. Um... Uh, actually, it's not just the server, Bob. You need to run a diagnostic on the entire network. What? Can you hold on one sec? Who's Bob? I never heard you mention Bob. Yeah, but you know Bob. Bobby. He works in the... corner. Uh, he brings in the... ...the dark roast... coffee. I'm not having an affair. I know you're not having an affair. I just don't want you to wake Mitchell. - Oh, okay - Okay. You, uh, you think she believed me, right? Yeah, Marshall. I think you're okay. Good. I'll run a trace on that call. Okay. It belongs to a Heinrich Roemer. Where do I know that name from? You're beautiful. What you must be going through... One of the men responsible, Ivan Curtis, he's been in contact with an arms dealer. Heinrich Roemer. According to SD-6 files, you've worked with him. Yes, he supplied arms to several SD cells. Curtis is planning a meet with Roemer. We don't know when. We need to locate Roemer's base of operations, get inside, wire it with cameras. So you can monitor him and wait for Curtis to make contact. I understand. This is your first lead, isn't it, Sydney? Yeah. Look, I know how important this is to you, but revenge is ultimately a hollow pursuit, Sydney. This isn't about revenge. They know who I am, they know where I work, and as long as they're out there, I am not safe. Okay. Roemer operates out of Amsterdam. Tactical entry is out of the question. Roemer is paranoid about security. You'll have to go in posing as buyers. There's a vending machine on Ballister, near Amstel. Enter the sequence 5-1-0-9-4. Shortly thereafter, you'll be contacted. Then all you need are the proper bona fides. Roemer's security system is capable of detecting bugs. Your best option is to piggy-back off his closed circuit feeds. Right jacket pocket. Keep it. A small gift. Follow me. Okay. I'm ready to hack into their surveillance system. You'll just need a directed RF pulse from your wristwatch for each interior camera. Gentlemen. Welcome. Heinrich Roemer. Jalin Khamisi. It's my pleasure. Oh. Sorry. My business manager Isaac Malcolm. Have a seat. So... who do I have to thank for your business? A mutual friend. Jean Briault. We worked together in Montreal. He spoke highly of you. Jean Briault. I haven't heard that name in years. He was a good man. It is a pity what happened. Well, what can I do for you? "3,000 kalashnikov rifles, 75-man portable shoulder-fired stinger missiles, m77 anti-personnel mines." What exactly would you do with a purchase this large? I intend to secure some beachfront property. An order of this size... ...it won't be easy. I couldn't do it for less than, say... $5 million. Uh, Mr. Khamisi will forward an additional 20% if you can complete delivery by... Friday. Oh, God. I'm so sorry, Mr. Khamisi. - I'm sorry. - It's no matter. No, it is, and it's my fault. Do you have someplace I can clean up? He'll show you the way. Thank you. Outrigger, camera one is up, connection solid. Camera two is online. - How are the video signals? - Good. Outrigger, we've got company. It's Curtis. He's here. You gotta move now. No. I know what you're thinking. Hold your position. Mr Roemer wasn't expecting you until tonight. Plans change. I took an earlier flight. I assume that won't be a problem. Of course not. I'll let him know you're here. I take payment via wire. Currency is too easy to counterfeit. Of course. Curtis. Yeah. If you'll excuse me, just a small matter I need to attend to. Please make sure our guest is comfortable. Mr Curtis. Good to see you. Where's my package? Well, your item arrived today. 25 kilos of nuridium as promised. Which leaves us just a matter of the payment. Sure thing. Thank you. Weiss is in trouble. I'm on it. Thanks. Come on. We gotta go. Need a ride? Get up! Would you take it easy? Shut up. Hey, listen, Syd, Dixon and I can handle this. No, I'm gonna talk to him. All right, fine. I'll be right here if you need me. Can we have a minute? Do you recognize me? No. Four months ago, you murdered a man... Michael Vaughn. Do you remember? I do. I was there. It'll be burned into my memory for the rest of my life as the day my child lost its father. So you can imagine what I'd like to do to you. Lucky for you, there someone I want even more. Tell me where I can find Gordon Dean. Is this whole routine supposed to scare me? I do this for a living. It's a funny thing about pregnancy. Hormones. I woke up today... feeling pretty hormonal. I'm gonna give you another chance. Where is Gordon Dean? Nuridium. That's some pretty nasty stuff. That's for sure. Uh, all right. Go ahead. Give me the lot number. "6-6-4-R-T-4-5-6-9." Yeah, NASA's been experimenting with nuridium as a long-term power source for deep space probes. Problem is, it's inherently unstable. It's most easily suited as a high-yield explosive. You know, I'm talkin' megaton here. Some big bang, kinda crazy badass stuff. But, uh, wait a minute. RT4569? - Yeah. - Are you sure? Yes, Marshall. You have no idea what you're getting involved in. Why don't you enlighten me? You wanna know the truth? The truth is you're better off not knowing. We need to talk. Six canisters of nuridium disappeared from a Russian processing plant last month from the same lot as the one we just recovered. The phone call between Curtis and Roemer they talked about the rest of the shipment. We think that Curtis already has the other canisters. Our options here are limited, Syd. But we think if we let him go, there's a really good chance that he'll lead us to the rest of the nuridium. You wanna let him go. We'll make him believe he's escaped. No. We can't risk losing him. The risks will be minimal. We just need more time to break him. We don't have more time. With that much nuridium, we may be looking at Hiroshima times 50. We're talking about releasing the man who killed Vaughn. Water? Thank you. We know about the nuridium. I see. Possession of nuridium is considered an act of terrorism, based on which we can lock you away indefinitely. No formal charges, no trial. But right now that does neither of us any good. Tell us where the rest of the nuridium is, what you intend to do with it, and we'll cut you a deal. I want immunity... for everything the nuridium and killing Michael Vaughn. You'd do it, wouldn't you? You'd have to. Well, I'll save you the trouble. No deal. I'm not talking. Sorry, baby. Daddy just went snooping where he shouldn't have gone. Did he drink enough? Yeah. I'd say we've got about two hours before the tracking serum enters his bloodstream. All right, I'll set up the scanner. That stuff will poison you, you know. Liberal rag. Coffee's not too good for you either. I think I found your man. Ouider, like you asked, but fully documented. No family, no entanglements. Just off a 4-year tour with the special ops. I know. I assume you can deal with that. They say he also has a bit of a temper. Seriously, something has to be done about your breath. Oh, yeah? How about this? Jackass. Thomas Grace? Who wants to know? Let's take a walk. Did you know that we have astronaut ice cream here? The neapolitan is a little nasty, but apparently it lasts for centuries. - Still nothing? - Nothing. You know, how quickly the isotope is absorbed depends on this guy's metabolism. It's been two and a half hours. It's going to hit, Syd. Trust me. All right, you know what? I can't wait with this any longer. I've been offered a promotion to coordinate the covert ops for the N.S.C., and I've known about it for a week. I asked your father not to tell you 'cause I wanted to tell you myself, but there hasn't been a really great time... Wait a minute. In D.C.? Yeah. Steps away from the President. Well, that's great That's good news. I'm gonna miss you. But I'm really, really happy for you. - I can't do it. - Weiss... No, I can't do it. Come on, Syd. Vaughn, Nadia. I mean, to leave now just doesn't seem right. Listen to what you're saying. Steps away from the President. Oh, I know. You can't say no to that. Okay, we got a signal on Curtis. Where is he? I can't tell. It's not pinpointing. That's because he's not on the ground. All right, during the hivernal equinox, you can actually balance an egg on its end. No, you can't. It's a myth. No, it's not. It has something to do with the Earth's axis and the alignment of the sun. Trust me. I googled it. Yeah, okay, just like water swirls the other way in toilets in Australia? - It does. - Hello. Guys, I'm gonna take this. I'll be right back. Mr Curtis, what can I do for you? Let Dean know we are on our way. We've got the device on board, but I am going to need the analysis team to meet us at the airfield. Of course. We're 200 miles out. Right on schedule. At 1700 hours, Ivan Curtis boarded a private jet. Marshall pulled the cargo manifests from Schiphol. Curtis loaded several oversized containers onto the plane. He's transporting the weapon. The flight plan indicates their final destination is Pyongyang. The flight was granted diplomatic immunity. Diplomatic immunity? How's that possible? We're still exploring that. We can't just let these guys fly to North Korea. There's gotta be something we can do. Maybe there is. We're just about there. What's their current position? Do we have an E.T.A. for rendezvous? Okay, the docking point is 2 miles out. Final approach for hookup. Is there any indication they've been detected? No. A.T.C.'s still blind. And I was able to jam the airliner's traffic collision avoidance system. They don't know we're coming. Good. Keep me posted. I want to know the second that plane is secured. Okay. Docking tube's pressurized. Yes? Rendezvous complete. They're onboard. Good. Thank you. - Flinkman. - Hey, it's me. Oh, yeah, I know. I gave you your own ringtone. So did you find the bomb? I'm standing right in front of it. Okay, great. Well, what do you see? Tell me about it. It's about 8 feet by 3 feet. There's a hose running alongside it. Looks like it's feeding the nuridium into the panel. Okay, you need to access that panel. Can you get to it? Can you open it? Let me see. Just give me a sec. Three Tango. On my go. Three, two... one. Go, go, go, go. Oh, you know what? There should be a detonator attached to the regulator. Do you see that? Okay. I don't see it. Well, it has to be there, because without a detonator, there's no detonation. That's how it works. Fine. I'm just telling you, it's not here. Well, Syd, it has to be there, okay? Because there is no bomb without a detonator. Marshall... I don't think it's a bomb. I don't believe you have a boarding pass. Go ahead. Shoot me. But if you do, there's a damn good chance my hand will slip and I'll cut this connection. Whoever this guy is, he's obviously pretty important to you. It'd be a shame if something happened to him. Step away from the container. I don't think so. Dixon, cover me! You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into. I'll ask you once, and if you don't answer me, I will cut this. Who is Dean working with? Who gave the order to kill Michael Vaughn? Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me. Humor me. Going in the cockpit. - I got him. Take him. - Got it. What are you waiting for? Turn around, on your knees. I'm taking you in. Then... you might as well kill me. I won't survive the night in custody. If you're willing to cooperate, we can protect you. No. You have no idea. - These people... - Who? Our initial assumptions were wrong. The nuridium wasn't being utilized as an explosive. We believe it was used to power a cryogenic chamber. You mean freezing people, cryogenics? Sort of. It's usually done with liquid nitrogen, but this is like next-gen cryopreservation. I mean, whoever this person is or was... they probably died of a terminal illness, and they're using this container to preserve the corpse until a treatment is found. Of course, the notion that anyone can ever actually be revived-- complete fiction. Believe me, I've tried. Have we I.D.'ed the body? Not yet. The container is currently in D.S.R. Custody. They'll forward us the forensic analysis as soon as it's complete. An evidence team scoured the plane for anything that might be of value, but I'm not expecting anything to come of it. For now, we've done everything we can. We'll just have to wait for the reports. Sydney... We lost our only lead on Gordon Dean. I'm not sure if I can do this, dad. - We'll get another lead. - It's not that. It's everything. It's... It's hard being without him. I saw the baby's heartbeat for the first time the other day. I was by myself. It's not fair. He should have been there. I'm here. How can I help? My next doctor's appointment's in a few weeks. Would you go with me? Sweetheart, of course I will. Sydney... You're gonna be okay. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, how you doing? Eric Weiss. - Tom Grace. - Hi, Tom. Uh, listen, this desk isn't exactly an ideal location for you. It's, you know, right under the air conditioning vent, and there's actually a wobble in the desk. You know? Yeah. I get it. The guy I'm replacing... he sat here. You can have mine. That's... I'm not gonna need it anymore, and, you know, actually, I suppose you're replacing me as well. These are really good people here. Yeah. Hey. I'll see you soon enough. That's all I know. We'd better notify Jack. Yeah. Yeah. Go, go. - Hello? - Hey. Got your message. Have you identified the body? That's why I'm calling. The body was stolen. It was being held by a Scientific Research division. Their facility was hit. Once I get the incident report, I'll forward you the details. I'll dig around. See what I can find out.
