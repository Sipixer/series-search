I was sworn to secrecy, but I couldn't keep it from my fianc√©. And when the head of SD-6 found out, he had him killed. That's when I learned the truth, SD-6 is not part of the CIA. I'd been working for the people I thought I was fighting. I went to the only place that could help me take them down. Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA, where my handler is Michael Vaughn. Only one other person knows what I do. Another double agent in SD-6. Someone I hardly know. My father. We have a lot of questions about your father. I copied his file. What do you know about case 3-32L? There are missing pages in my father's file, and references to case 3-32L. - An Agent Calder. - You read that too. Calder wasn't CIA. He was FBI. Why would the FBI be working with my father? They wouldn't. Unless they suspected him of selling secrets. Break into the building as planned. While Dixon sets the explosives, get the inhaler and meet the CIA team inside. By then, Dixon should be outside. You'll disable the explosive while the CIA team searches the lab's main computer system. - We gotta go. What are you doing? - I brought a secondary detonator. Good to go? Let's go. Sydney? We've gotta run. Sydney, we've gotta move. Sydney, we've gotta move! Now! - What's the matter? Are you hurt? - No. Go. Run! Go, go, go, go! Come on, Sydney. We gotta go. I couldn't move. Dixon had to drag me to my feet just to get to the van. And when he asked me what was wrong, why I'd just frozen, I made up something about having a flashback to Danny. - You did everything you could. - I was meant to stop the detonation. I didn't. Because of that, four CIA agents were killed. You had no way of knowing Dixon had a second trigger. - There was nothing you could do. - I could have told him the truth. Dixon needs to know who he's really working for. - Sydney... - I know. - I can't put his family at risk. - Or yourself. I know all of that, but it's the right thing to do. - Those men died for no reason. - Those men died for their country. Sydney, I'm sorry. I'm sorry you had to go through that. - You worked late. - Bar Association dinner. A lawyer wanted to sue me because his chicken was undercooked. Can you believe that? An obnoxious lawyer? Have you talked to your obnoxious lawyer? I'm meeting Charlie for lunch this week. That's good. - Syd, he's gonna break up with me. - Did he say that? He didn't say it. He didn't have to. He was sneaking around on me. We saw him with that girl, Rachel. There's stuff he's doing that he can't tell me about? Please. He wouldn't meet with you just to break up with you. Guys don't do that. If they wanna end things, they just vanish. Your mom was so pretty. Yeah, she was. Thanks. I gotta go change. I feel a binge coming on. How was your trip? Not good. I was working with these people who... They were terminated. Oh, man. The economy sucks. - Hello? - This is Helen Calder. You left me a message about my husband working with your father. I know that your husband worked for the FBI and he investigated CIA agents suspected of spying for Russia. My dad was one of the agents that your husband investigated. I know that much. Did he ever mention the name Jack Bristow? I'm sorry. Bentley didn't talk much about his work. He looks kind. He is. - I thought Bentley was dead. - Oh, dear, no. That isn't Bentley. That's my boyfriend, Gary. This... is Bentley. He wasn't so nice. - When did Bentley pass away? - 1981, in a car accident. - Do you have a copy of this? - I think so. For 20 years I thought I knew how my mom died. She and my dad had been out at the movies. They were coming home late, and a postal worker was driving in the other direction. Alcohol wasn't a factor. He'd fallen asleep. His car drifted over the white line. Dad swerved and went off the bridge. I always told myself Mom didn't have time to know what was happening. Now, I know that Calder was hunting down a KGB agent, my father. Whatever happened that night was no accident. Calder was chasing them. They probably lost control and the cars crashed. Whatever it was, it brings me back to the same conclusion. If my father hadn't been a double agent... ...my mom would still be alive today. I'm sorry to lay all this on you. But I have no one to talk to about this. - It's OK. - I want to report him. - What? - I want to turn him in. For being under suspicion 20 years ago? What about the file? There were pages missing. Maybe he still works for Russia. Stop, OK? Just stop. What matters is taking down SD-6. Your father's helping us do that. You suggest I do nothing? We have too much to do on your relationship. I wasn't to do anything about Dixon. Is anything unacceptable to you? It's your dad. If he sold secrets or is selling secrets, that's hard. - I hope it would be hard on you. - Before you do anything, let me find out if he's under suspicion. Just give me two days. I get it. You wanted to do it in person, but instead of coming out with it, you're making small talk, which is pathetic. Francie... I have always supported you, no matter what. The idea that you'd sneak around and lie about it is the worst part. - After all we've been through... - I want to be a singer. A singer? I wasn't gonna say anything till I had everything set up. That woman, Rachel? She plays piano. When you saw us that night, we were rehearsing. We have our first gig this Friday night. A singer? Sweetheart, I'm sorry I wasn't upfront before, but my being a lawyer has been the family's goal forever, and the thought of me doing something else or wanting to is... I've been too afraid to admit that. - You're not breaking up with me? - Are you kidding? You're my baby. Charlie singing? I wouldn't miss it. - Will. - Yeah, I'll be there. Yes. Yes. Best behaviour. I got it. - Get off my chair. - How's Sydney? That was Sydney? You gotta stop doing that. Anybody call when I was ill? Yeah, a guy from the DMV. He ran the licence plate off Kate Jones's car. Or the woman pretending to be her. According to her social security number, Kate Jones died in 1973. Hello, Hank? Hello, it's Will. You come up with anything? Did it match a licence plate for a 663 Sam Tango Frank? You're the best. OK... Eloise Kurtz. Eloise Kurtz is proof someone's covering up Danny's murder. And she was lying about having an affair with him. 223 Whitley Place, Hollywood. Good work in Germany. The inhaler prototype's safely in analysis. The Badenweiler factory was demolished without casualties. Thanks. Dixon deserves the credit, not me. Jack will no longer be working out of Jennings Aerospace. His assignment there is complete. As of today, he'll be working here with a cover as portfolio manager for Credit Dauphine. This way, he can more actively participate in the planning and execution of missions. - Good. - Jack? Two months ago, FTL vacated their base at Rabat and their support station at Shaneer. All the heavy equipment was moved, including the T47 s. At the time, recovery team found this at Rabat. Last week, we learned FTL abandoned their transfer facility. Our recovery team did a sweep and returned with this. Is the ink encoded? That was my first thought, as well. I'm sorry. You want some fritter? It's apple. Analysis studied the music sample. They found an identical pattern of numbers buried in higher frequencies. It's not noise. It's where they hid the code. - Have we deciphered it? - No. Mirage. It's a converted salvage tug. FTL uses it as a floating lab. Weapon design, data storage, crypto. An SD-6 commando team stormed the ship last night as it passed through the Panama Canal. They brought back this. - What is it? - FTL's latest code machine. Without this, we're unable to read their communications. - How does it work? - Very well. - We don't know yet. - The team got what they could. But there was a self-destruct on the ship. Needless to say, they left fairly quickly. They found out only eight decoders were produced. One is now in the possession of this man. John Smythe, owner of Hobbs End Photo Gallery in London. Also an FTL operative. One of the code machines is being held at the gallery awaiting pick-up next Tuesday. You leave for London tonight. We want to know where FTL went and what they're up to. Your job is to bring back the encoding machine. I would have told you about the realignment, but you were in Badenweiler. I heard about what happened. It's tragic. I know about you. That you were hunted by the FBI and I know that Mom died because they were after you. Sydney. Every time I think I know just how awful you are, I learn something worse. But this time, I'm gonna make sure you pay. - What's this? - A bug. - What are you, 12 years old? - No, a bug. We didn't know about Smythe. - They'll scan for listening devices. - The technology is passive. Langley cribbed the design from a Russian device. It works when hit with a microwave beam off a satellite. Then it acts as a microphone. It's undetectable. - They'll just think it's a bug. - Exactly. What about the code machine? We won't have time to switch, so deliver it to SD-6. When the code's broken, they'll inform officers using the network. Thanks to you, we're still downloading their data. - How much have you got so far? - Almost two percent. In all this time, that's all you got? If we take too much too quickly they'll notice, but if we're patient, we can get all their files and do some real damage. Good. I checked about your dad. He's clean. No internal investigations. - I told him. - Told him what? That I know about Calder, his spying for the KGB, the accident. Damn it, I asked you not to say anything. I don't care. If you were in my position, you wouldn't be able to control yourself. - You're gonna have to learn to. - Don't lecture me about my father. Because of this spy trade, my mother is dead. You couldn't understand what it's like to have a parent die that way. There's a book back at Langley. They keep it locked up under glass. Behind it is a marble wall with stars carved in it. It's a memorial to the agents lost in action. Families are never told how they died or where, only that they won't be coming home. I was eight when my father became one of those stars. At the funerals, there's a protocol the agency representative has to follow. What to say, whose hand to shake. You're admonished. That's the word they use, admonished, not to be conspicuously emotional. Vaughn, I'm so sorry. The agents that died at Badenweiler... ...l've been assigned to represent the agency at their funerals. Delivery. Got a package for Eloise Kurtz. I just need five minutes. - How did you know my name? - I won't use it if you're afraid. I don't know anything. People who say that know more than they think. Do you know how they killed Danny? Shot him in his bathtub. - I don't know anything. - Three bullets, one in his heart. - I'm warning you. - Five minutes. I have pepper spray. - God! - I told you. My eyes! - I warned you. Now just go away! - OK! Ready? It should take me 20 seconds to get down the hall. Excuse me, sir. Hello. Actually, this is a non-smoking gallery. Not any more. I'm afraid if you don't put that out, we'll escort you to the door. What kind of a deal do you think I can get if I take, say, the entire collection? I'll go call the owner. Yeah? I'll be right there. Chester Conlan is an award-winning artist. - It is almost Keiferesque. - I said the same thing. Is this bothering you, by the way? Not at all. I am tempted, but... I don't know. Sir, I've already offered to come down ten percent. Ten... percent is not 20 percent. I'll eat the tax, but that is it. Ch√©ri? I think I prefer the Lamborghini. You are the birthday girl. Could you do something with this? He doesn't sing in the car or in the shower. He doesn't even the national anthem at baseball games. He doesn't even hum. Too, like, "I'm with the band", kinda. If he had a good voice, he would have used it somewhere, once. I would have heard it. You'll be there, right? I mean, I need you there. Of course I will. When he's not... If he's not good, he's gonna be so devastated, you know that. Or it could be the start of something great. - Raid my closet. - Thanks. But I got boobs. Hey. I'm Rachel. Charlie has told me so much about you. - Really? - Going for her MBA, best cook ever. - You're like this mythic person. - OK, I like her. And this is Will. - Know anything about me? - And Sydney. This is my sister, Amy. - Will Tippin. - It's Eloise Kurtz. Sorry, I can't hear you. Hold on. - This is so exciting. - A little terrifying. - We gotta get ready. - You guys are gonna be great. - This is gonna be a disaster. - Stop it. - Hi. - Are you alright? You mean, can I see again? - I feel horrible. - It's OK. I was wearing my glasses. - I'm really not a bad person. - I never said you were. Help me out, please. They gave me $2,000 to say I was having an affair with Danny Hecht. Who did? I was between jobs. My car was broken. Anybody in my position would have done the same. Can I buy you a coffee and meet you in person? Come by my apartment tomorrow afternoon. How about three o'clock? I have a great car mechanic if you need one. Hello? - Hello? - Yeah, I'm here. Listen. Everything's gonna be OK. - Fact checker. How's Francie? - A wreck. Charlie! When the road gets dark And you can no longer see Just let my love throw a spark And have a little faith in me When the tears you cry Are all you can believe Just give these loving arms a try And have a little faith in me And have a little faith in me Have a little faith in me... That's my boyfriend. Have a little faith in me Have a little faith in me When your secret heart Cannot sleep so easily Come here, darlin', I'm gonna whisper start Have a little faith in me It tickles. What just happened? It took a piece of your thumb, a speck. And this is true genius. It created a code from your DNA. That's how the code from the cards works. The encryption was DNA-based. - Whose? - We know he had a card. Gareth Parkashoff, leader of the FTL in Rabat. That's the good news. We know it's Parkashoff. Bad news is he's dead. We need his DNA, but we don't know where he's buried. Marshall? Marshall? - The system's a little sluggish. - Marshall, get Fisher. Last month, we received intel that Parkashoff was assassinated by Martin Shepard. Shepard's an interesting case. His subconscious was programmed to respond to a phrase. Say it to him and he'd do what you asked, even kill. Say it again and those acts would be erased from his mind. He'd have no recollection of his acts. We have known for some time what that phrase is. - It's by John Donne. - Right. Get close to Shepard, recite the poem and get him to tell you where Parkashoff is buried. Where is he? He checked himself into a mental institution in Bucharest, southern Romania. If you don't mind... There's something weird going on with the computer network. - Marshall? - Kind of a bandwidth leak. Why don't you get me a report by the end of the day? Agent Fisher will be your support. His alias is Dr Carlos Fontanetta. - Nice to meet you. - And you. The Mangalev clinic is expecting Dr Fontanetta to check a patient in the day after tomorrow. You are that patient. Your handler's unavailable. Locate Parkashoff. Relay the coordinates. Vaughn's at a funeral. Heroes died because of people like you. Relay the correct coordinates to SD-6. - Go to hell. - People's lives are at stake. Your life. What you think you know, you don't know. Then, you explain it to me. You don't have clearance. Clearance? To be told how my mother died? - There are rules. - Then you break them. Think about what you're saying. Acting cavalier about breaking the rules. Think about the last time you did something like that. I'm not a perfect man, I know that. But I am smart enough not to draw simple conclusions and act upon them. I'd think that if anyone had learned that lesson, it would have been you. Miss DiCamillo is bipolar. We were doing some relief work up in the north, when she suffered a psychotic break. She's suffering from auditory hallucinations. She thinks her government wants to kill her. Her previous doctor submitted her for some experimental treatments, lithium substitutes, neurolinguistic programming, all of which had no effect on her condition. I'm trying to find her parents, but, till then, I need a place for her. - Is she taking any anti-psychotics? - Olanzapine, 20 milligrams QPM. There are other institutions in Bucharest. How is it you honour us? The consulate, they directed me here. This way. We'll get her admitted. Miss Kurtz? I'm coming in. Easy on the pepper spray. Your dad was a hero. Oh, no. Oh, no! That leak... There's a hack on the network! They're downloading files off the server! Gotta cut the hard line! Hello. Alain? We need to meet. I think we have a mole. Hi. - Sorry to keep you waiting. - This is not a problem. Two more forms and her admission is complete. By the way, while you were waiting, I called to the consulate. Yes. I'm speaking at a UN conference on refugees in New York next month. I called them about a visa. Naturally, I thanked them for having recommended our institution, and I was surprised to hear that they were unaware of any such recommendation. Do I know you? "No man is an island, entire of itself." "Every man is a piece of the continent." Who are you? Who are you? That is because the consulate referred me to the local health department. That explains it. We know what you're doing, Miss Bristow. - Where's Vaughn? - He's covering the funerals. Badenweiler? Why, did you finally get a date? That asylum Bristow's been sent to?
