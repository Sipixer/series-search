How much does she know about this operation? Dean calls it "The Shed." She was recruited two years ago, computer specialist. She's willing to give us everything. - What is it? - We need some help. You have to walk back into that office and look everyone in the eye. You can't let em see that you know the truth. Rachel? I need a prep report by the end of the day. Okay. I'll get right on it. I think we may have a problem. - What kind of problem? - Rachel Gibson. She's copying everything on my server. Execute plan "B." They set off an E.M.P. They fried the electronics. She's okay. She's going to be okay. Thank you. Can I have the dice? You guys seem a little wound up. Let's loosen it up a little bit. Come on! Loosen it up! Get out the kinks! It's that easy. If it's that easy, I can't even help it. Bring 'em back. That's right. There we go. Come on, mama would love a new pair of shoes. Tell your pit boss we need more money. We're feeling lucky tonight. Ready? How did I win? I wasn't paying attention. I can't even help it. I can't help it. And it is that easy. This is disgusting. Can I help you with something, Frenchman? You're pregnant. You should not be in a casino. You should be at home. Do you feel at home, baby? We feel at home. Thank you. You're gonna bet against me? Well, good luck with that. Don't give me that look, frenchie. I warned you. This table's gone cold. Madame, could we please have a word with you? Sir, this is insane. Do you have any idea who I am? Sit down. I will not. I've done nothing wrong. Sit down. I have seen some despicable acts of cheating in my time, but a pregnant woman using her own baby to escape suspicion... I don't know how you live with yourself. What can I say, Sir? I'm not like other moms. Outrigger, I'm on my way to the vault. Sidewinder, I'm approaching the vault. What's your status? Sidewinder? Sidewinder's gonna need a little more time. I'm at the vault. I need that key code. Got it. - Ready when you are. - Go. 9-7-3-2-6-3-4-7. I've got the package. - I'll meet you to the front. - All right. This is Phoenix. We have the archive. Any complications? Well, I think I lost us about $900,000, depending on the exchange rate. Copy that. What's your location? I'm approaching the ferry now. Have a safe trip. Hello? You have something of mine. Who is this? I want my property back. I want Mockingbird. What? You will have your people deliver Mockingbird to me within the hour, or I will drop you. There must be some kind of mistake. I don't know what "Mockingbird" is. - You're wasting time. - Please, what is "Mockingbird"? Rachel, you should eat something. You need to eat. You need rest. The debriefing can wait. No, it can't. I know what you're going through. You need to give yourself time... It can't wait. I'm held together by a string right now, Ms. Bristow. A week ago, I had a good job working for the C.I.A. Now I have the truth. My job was a front for a mercenary organization, and my boss is a criminal, and my coworkers are all dead... because I got them killed. It wasn't your fault. They'd all still be alive if I hadn't walked into that building. Your boss, Gordon Dean... he killed them, not you. It doesn't change the fact that every time I close my eyes, I see their faces. So I need to give you everything I have right now, because the sooner I'm finished, the sooner this is over. Rachel, first of all, just don't call me "Ms. Bristow". It's Sydney. Secondly, your information will go a long way towards helping us find Gordon Dean. We will get the people responsible for this. Then I'd better get back to work. Oh, by the way, uh, a name keeps coming up in your data... "Mockingbird". We don't have a base reference for it. Sorry. It's a briefing habit. I take it for granted. It's, um, my agency call sign. It's me. I'm Mockingbird. Translation : Anyone Inermis Sixe Guilamu Transcript : Raceman Synchro : Guilamu Suggestions critics insults : aliassub@gmail.com I have an assignment suited to your abilities. I'll leave the approach to your discretion. I assume you're familiar with the target. I am. You'll have our full resources at your disposal. You have resources? Don't let the appearance fool you. We're in the midst of a relocation. I'll keep you updated. I need money. Where do we stand on the satellite offices? Cleveland, Seattle, Chicago, they've all been abandoned. We beat the C.I.A. by about an hour at the St. Louis office. They find anything? Just extension cords and surge protectors. Alternate location should be set up by day's end. We've got the account transfers ready across the board. I just need your pass code for the withdrawals. God, you're paranoid. That's why I'm still alive. I got him. I've been monitoring Dean's bank accounts based on your intel. 30 minutes ago, he liquidated every single one of them. Our infiltration in Prague must have him concerned. He's closing ranks, covering his tracks. Right, but not to worry, because I'm a bit of a master tracker myself. I'm kind of like a Comanche Indian. You know... Comanche Indian who tracks data. Anyway, he consolidated all of his funds. He deposited them into one account designated... 1017. It's the agency fail-safe account in the Cayman Islands. I set it up. 10/17 is my birthday. Wait. Dean's money is all in one place? If we seize his funds, we can cripple his operation. You won't be able to do it. It's a trapdoor account. It can't be hacked. You have to be at the bank to access it, and you need the prearranged responses to Dean's protocol questions. The only answer set is on Dean's server in the Prague office, which he destroyed, I know how he works. The only copy of his protocol was in that building when he blew it up. There's nothing left. What? Czech authorities have begun their investigations into the bombings. We've accessed their site inventories. And they have catalogued already several BR-46 servers. That's them. Marshall's designed E.M. recovery software. We can reconstruct the protocol. Here's the problem. The B.I.S. won't release their evidence until they finish their investigation. So I'm going back to Prague. I need you to come with me. - No. Absolutely not. - Rachel... You want me to dig through that building? If Dean transfers his assets before we can access his account, we lose him entirely. I'm not going back there. Those people are all dead because of me. I'm not going to search through their remains. I wouldn't ask to do this if there was another way. Believe me, we need you to do this. We need you to go back into that building. Mr. Sloane, my name is Boyd Harkin. I'm special prosecutor to your case. I'm required to inform you that under national security directive 115b, you do not qualify for legal counsel. I understand. This is Deputy Director Miller, Undersecretary Reeves. We've spent the last few months reviewing your case. The Justice Department is prepared to accept our recommendation for your sentencing. Before we rule, however, we have a few questions for you. - I'm prepared to cooperate. - Good. Mr. Sloane, a little over a year ago, you signed a pardon agreement with the Justice Department. What were the terms of that agreement? I was asked to oversee a black ops unit for the C.I.A. In exchange for my participation, I received a pardon for a crimes. Let's talk about those crimes. Your record reads like a veritable catalog of illegal activity... multiple counts of murder, conspiracy, treason. I have trouble understanding how any pardon agreement resulting in your freedom could be justified. If you will examin the record of the previous proceedings, you will find the charges against me were carefully considered before they were dismissed as to whether the pardon itself was justified. I suppose that's a question for the Justice Department. Perhaps. But since I have you in front of me right now, why don't we see if we can suss it out? Of course. We're scheduled to meet the emissary at 3. Sydney should have touched down in Prague by now. Give her two hours in and out of the site. Should have plenty of time to spare. We know what this emissary looks like? No. He's got our descriptions. He'll escort us from the beach. Helps keep the bank's location secret. If he tries to blindfold us, he may have a problem. I'm not in the mood for blindfolds today. Noted. What do we do till 3? We wait. I can't do this. We've got the easy job. Once we access the protocol, we feed it to Tom and Dixon. They handle the heavy stuff. We're out of there. There's a reason I wanted to work at a desk. I don't like pressure... or death, for that matter. Listen to me. I have to do unpleasant tasks all the time, and the best way to do it is to become someone else. Where are the B.I.S. badges? I'm not Sydney Bristow. You're not Rachel Gibson. We're Czech Intelligence Terrorism Unit. When we walk on that floor, we outrank everyone else in the room. Act like it. Nothing in there can rattle us because we see this type of thing everyday. We see this everyday. We see this everyday. Which way do we go? Follow me. It should be right here. Let's get to work. Excuse me. Misters Taldash and White? My name is Pierpont. I'm here to escort you to the bank. You're early. I'm merely following your account's protocol. Is there a problem? Of course not. Excuse me. Yeah, this is it. This is Mr. Taldash, room 440. I'm going to have to cancel my massage this afternoon. I'm afraid I got my times mixed up. Thank you. - Shall we? - Yeah. That was Dixon. We don't have as much time as we thought. Oh, God. It's okay. It's okay. I'll just-- I'll deal with the server. Go on. I've got to get out of here. Rachel. Rachel, look at me. I'll handle the server, but you have to tell me what to do. You need the hard drive. Which one? Fifth. Fifth one down. Get the computer ready. Rachel. So how far is the bank? You've never been here before? This is our first time in the Caymans. Ah, well, you're lucky. The bank's not far today. We gave up our fixed location years ago. Technology allows us a certain fluidity. We find our clients prefer our business remain mobile. Our clients, as I'm sure you're aware, are highly security-conscious. Welcome to First Cayman Trust. Hook it up. Are the weapons necessary? They certainly won't be if you know your account's protocol. Give me your hand. Hook it up. Gentlemen, there are over 300 possible questions. We've committed the answers to memory. Our boss is highly security-conscious. Of course. Here we go. "The select blood runs through..." Do you need me to repeat the question? No. "The select blood runs through..." "Rouquet's heart." "Rouquet's heart." "The future's history is written in..." "The ink of the past." What are these questions? "The ink of the past." "What the mirror reflects..." "Lives eternal." "Lives eternal." "If there was never a one, there was ever..." - Oh, no. - What? The data's corrupt. "If there was never a one, there was ever..." This was yours. No. No, no. This was yours. I've heard Dean say this before. You had all the questions that rhymed, remember? Yes. Gentlemen, I need an answer. "If there was never a one, there was ever..." - "The twelve." - "The twelve." "The twelve." I'm sorry. Gentlemen, we're at your service. Come on. Let's get out of here. It's over. Come on. Can I get you something to drink, a cigar? You know what? I'd love a drink. Someone accessed the 1017 account. They cleaned us out. We lost everything. That's impossible. They were on-site, transferred from the Caymans. No one can do that. I am the only one with... She's still alive. Rachel Gibson's still alive. And they've got her in custody. We need to get her back. I'd like to turn our attention to Omnifam. For three years, I ran a world relief organization dedicated to humanitarian causes. Which you used as a cover for a genetic engineering project that almost caused a global genocide. Yes. "Yes"? Mr. Sloane, I just accused you of attempting to murder millions of people. I was hoping for a bit more than a "yes." For years, I was driven by a misguided attempt to pursue... a higher power. I will not attempt to deny my wrongdoings. There is no reason to. The government has pardoned me for those actions. However, I am reformed. Two years ago, I learned I had a daughter. She has changed my life. Since the moment I met her, I have dedicated my every moment, every action, to atoning for my sins. Mr. Sloane, four months ago you betrayed your agency and participated in a conspiracy that caused the deaths of thousands of people in Sovogda. How exactly is that atoning for your sins? I did not betray my agency. I was forced to go undercover to establish credentials with Elena Derevko. And you should have in front of you corresponding statements from the agents involved. Yes, I have the statements. Your colleagues seem to have bought your hollow justifications, but I find your actions fit a pattern of criminal behavior you have demonstrated your entire life. Time and again you explain away your crimes as some sort of necessary evil. I find it shocking people continue to believe your lies. In truth, these proceedings are a mere formality. You will atone for your sins, Mr. Sloane. Only you don't get to decide the punishment. We do. Assuming the worst, it will happen fast. You'll be immediately transferred to a federal penitentiary. It's doubtful we'll have a chance to go over your affairs, assuming they rule against you. They're going to rule against me. Thank you for getting Sydney and Marcus to write statements on my behalf. I'm sure that must have been very difficult. They volunteered. I didn't have to ask. Well, thank them for me. I want to give you the power of attorney over Nadia. Of course. Promise me you'll do everything you can to save her, Jack, as if she were your own daughter. - You have my word. - Thank you. He's scared. The Cayman transfer was a success. We were able to take full control of Dean's finances. As a result, he's getting sloppy, making uncharacteristic mistakes. An hour ago, Echelon intercepted a call Dean placed to Laurent Moreau, a business associate Ms. Gibson flagged in her debriefings. You lost everything. It's a setback. We're moving forward as scheduled, but I need to retrieve my operations archives. You're planning on blackmailing yourself out of the red? Where are the archives, Laurent? Relax. They're safe at Rue L'Or. I'll contact you Thursday to arrange transfer. Dean's going after his archives. If we can beat him to it, we'd have access to Dean's entire operation. They said they're being held at Rue L'Or. Where's that? Well, looks like it's in Monte Carlo, one of Moreau's fronts. Hey, it's a casino. What do we do with all that money we seized? Having trouble sleeping, Mr. Sloane? I don't blame you. You'd have to count a lot of sheep to erase today's proceedings, that's for sure. I'm guessing they're gonna put you away for a long time, which is just too bad, really, 'cause... it'll be awful hard to help that daughter of yours from inside a federal penitentiary. Of course, it doesn't have to be that way. Huh, Mr. Sloane? I work for some very powerful people. My benefactors may be able to help sway the committee's decision tomorrow. I see. And I suppose that these benefactors of yours want something in return for their help. They would at that. We need to tap into the fiber optics. There's a maintenance station in the parking garage. Guard checkpoints are here and here. They've got the garage locked down. I can get into the parking garage. Hey, guys, check this out. Winner-- 7, every time. 7. Marshall, you're not supposed to hit 7. No, no, it's-- it-- it's supposed to hit 7, right? I mean... See? Winner, 7. You've got it backwards. She's right. Really? Talk to me about this vault. The deposit boxes are in electromagnetic tumblers. Can we get around it? It's on a systemic system. The mainframe resets the pass codes daily. I can get around it. If it's an E.M. system, I can decrypt the algorithm. I just need access to the building's network. Can we do it from a remote location? It's a segregated network. I'd have to be there. But... I'll go. - I'll do it. - It's okay. No, I-- I mean, I want to. I had to dig through my friends, yesterday, because of Gordon Dean. If I can help you stop him, then that's what I need to do. There's not a whole lot that'll scare me. Not anymore. Tell your pit boss we need more money. We're feeling lucky tonight. Madame, can we please have a word with you? I need a piece of paper. Here, have this. Sidewinder, I'm approaching the vault. What's your status? - They're ready for us. - Sidewinder? We gotta go. Do you wanna come over here and do the advanced binomial calculus? 'Cause I'd be more than happy to stand there and watch. Sidewinder's gonna need a little more time. I'm at the vault. I need that key code. Got it. I've got the package. This is Phoenix. We have the archive. - What's your location? - I'm approaching the ferry now. Copy that. Have a safe trip. I don't know what "Mockingbird" is. Please, what is "Mockingbird"? I can't help you if you don't tell me what you want. Ms. Bristow, you're not exactly in the position to play coy. You know who I am. Yes. You know what I want. You're not thinking this through, Dean. If you drop me, you destroy your archive. The laptop's a fake. There's nothing on it. Where's Mockingbird now? Ms. Bristow... All right, all right, you win. Listen... the C.I.A. has her in protective custody. She's... in a safe-- What? She's in a safe house in Philadelphia. Listen carefully. Tell your people to deliver her to the 30th Street train station. They have exactly 30 minutes. Sydney... what's happening? Rachel, hang on a sec. I gotta call my dad. Dean doesn't know Rachel's with you? No. He's expecting the C.I.A. to deliver her in exactly... 26 minutes. Task the satellites. I want full coverage of her area. Sydney, if Dean calls again, route it through us. Don't worry. We'll get you down. You'd better. Dixon, where are you? We're en route. Five minutes away. Approach carefully. We don't know who's on the ground, but get to that crane. Rules of engagement are at your discretion. Copy that. Almost there. Rachel, how you doing? I've been better. How are you? Oh, you know, just another day at the office. Hey, Rachel, look around back there. Is there anything that might be useful? Uh, well, there's a tire... and a crowbar, and I have my purse. - Are those helpful? - No, not really. How high up are we? Oh, just... a couple hundred feet. Don't worry. I've been in much worse situations than this. You have? Area's clear so far. We're approaching the cab now. It's empty. Can you get to the controls? Hang on. He's got some sort of... Uh-oh. That was fast. Do it. Sydney? Pull your agents off-site, right now. Outrigger, get out of there. You're trying my patience, Ms. Bristow. Any further deviations, and I will drop you. I want confirmation Mockingbird's en route. - What sort of confirmation? - Have her call me. What? Dean's got the place wired. It's all on remote. If I can isolate the frequency, I might be able to override the crane's controls. What do you need from us? Just time. Just time. Sydney. I can't do that. I can't call him. He'll know. I'm a terrible liar. That's why he wants me to call. Rachel, this is easy. This is just like in Prague. You have to become someone else. You have to become the person you used to be. All you have to do is act helpless and scared. I am scared. Yeah, but you're not helpless, not anymore. Look... I've spent my life dealing with men like Gordon Dean. They all have a fatal flaw. They always want power. So you just fool 'em into thinking they have it, and you hit 'em when they're not looking. So what do I do? Act terrified. Keep him on the phone. We'll do the rest. Hello. They told me to call you. Rachel. Where are you? I'm in a van. I don't know. They wanted me... they wanted me to tell you that they're doing everything you asked. They're turning me over to you. They won't tell me anything else. What are you gonna do to me? Just come in, Rachel. We need to talk to you. I didn't tell them anything. I swear, I didn't tell them anything. I believe you. Marshall? I'm almost there, almost there. Just give me a sec. Give me a sec. Almost there. What are you gonna do to me? That depends on how cooperative you are. I'll do anything you want. Please, Mr. Dean. Please. I don't wanna die. Rachel, plan "B." What was that? Kick the backseat as hard as you can. Now, do it right now! The crowbar. She's in the car. Give me your hand. Drop 'em! Mr. Sloane, this committee has reviewed your case and is prepared to render its ruling. Before we do so, I'd like to reiterate for the record my extreme disapproval for tactics you have employed while working under the auspices of the United States Government. Your compromised methodology sullies the name of every man and woman who serves this country honorably. However, while I may detest your methods, I cannot deny your results. After careful examination of the facts, this committee is forced to conclude your recent actions fall within the guidelines of your pardon agreement, and that, in truth, you have this country's best interests in mind. I find no cause for violation. Arvin Sloane, I hereby order your release, effective immediately. How can you people sleep after something like this? You just learn to take it where you can get it, I guess. It's never gonna be over, is it? I'm gonna be with you awhile. In custody, I mean. You'll be with us until it's safe for you to go home. When will that be? I honestly don't know. Dean knows how dangerous you are to him. We can't release you until we've brought him in. But it doesn't end with Dean. No, it doesn't. It's never gonna be safe. I guess we'll have to bring 'em all down. Every single one of 'em. Translation : Anyone Inermis Sixe Guilamu
