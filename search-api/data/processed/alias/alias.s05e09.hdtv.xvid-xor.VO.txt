It's like the Alliance all over again. How are you feeling, Dr. Desantis? Girl's alive. She calls herself Renée Rienne. Works with the C.I.A. Then keeping an eye on her won't be a problem. A job well done, Mr. Sloane. I'm so glad you took our offer. I didn't have much of a choice, did I? There's always a choice. We got Dean. They insisted to kill Michael Vaughn. They have plans for you. What plans? Translation : Anyone Sixe Guilamu I'm back. - Hey. - Hey. What took you so long? Traffic light out on Venice. - Want to look at something for me? - Sure. You see an eyelash? Something itches like hell. - No. - You sure? Yeah. Maybe it's those contacts you wore on the Ireland mission irritated your eye. Yeah. What's this? What do you think about orecchiette? I don't think I've ever heard of it. Wait a minute. Don't tell me you cook? There is a lot of things about me you don't know. You clean, too? I've been known to. Why, you thinking about hiring me? Why would I hire you when I get you for free? You taking a bath? Maybe. Maybe we're gonna take a bath. Damn it. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Let me see. - It's nothing. - Not nothing. There you go. All better. You're gonna make a great mom. Yeah, maybe. It's just my mom wasn't exactly the best role model, you know. Yeah, well, the good news is that you're nothing like your mother. You're not there yet, Sydney. Did you hear that? - What? - Radio. You need to go further back. Follow Vaughn. It's just the radio, Syd. If you don't like it, we can turn it off. That's right. How about a nice bottle of wine with this bath? That'd be great. Who are you? Sit still. We're almost there, Sydney. We almost have what we need. We just need to go a little further. What are you doing to me? Nothing for you to worry about. I'm just trying to help you relax. Why? What do you want? I just need to find a vein... Stop. Are you certain this won't harm the baby? Quite certain. Wait. The baby? Don't... But if you want your answer, you're gonna need to let me do my job. Who is that behind there? Who's behind there? Okay. You may proceed. If you hurt my baby, I swear to you I will kill you. - You like? - Yes. I like very much. It's nice to see a girl like you eating noodle. My granddaughter... she tell me "too many carbs". Thank you. I'm late for a date. Okay. Excuse me! Mister! - Yeah? - Thank God. I'm supposed to meet some friends in the Mission District. But my cab driver from Oakland just drove me off here and zoomed off. I've been trying to find a cab, but no one here speaks English. There's a stand two blocks over to the right. Thank you. Oh, do you know what time it is? Yeah, it's a quarter to... Nice watch. Again, Turner? You're gonna miss your plane. If you miss that pickup in Cartagena, I'm gonna hear from the Director. What'd you forget this time? Mister, you okay? This is agent 4962 Bravo requesting the technician. This is he. Dr. Desantis, this is Kelly Peyton. Were you able to retrieve agent Vaughn's files? Yes. I'm exiting Cha-kow street now. I'll run the analysis and be in touch. Excellent. I'll let our benefactors know. What's all that noise? You know how it is... rough neighborhood. After your initial triage and check-in, we'll bring you up here to the labor and delivery rooms. So this is where I'll be getting my epidural? Yes, it is, if you want one. I do. I'm not a big fan of pain. Are there any adjustments Sydney should be making to her lifestyle? I'm sure her boss at the bank would be happy to lighten her workload. No, she's fine. I tell mothers staying active for as long as they can is a good thing. You must be excited. Won't be much longer now. Oh, no, the due date's still 3 weeks away. Sure it is, but you never know. Your baby may be in a hurry. And you're far enough along, if your water broke today, we could expect a healthy delivery. I didn't know that. My service. I need to run. I'll see you next week for your checkup. Okay. So... any day. Well, she said it could be any day. I have something for you. What? A gift? Technically, no. It's already yours. I'm just returning it. Your mother and I bought it when you were born. You wouldn't let it out of your sight till you were almost 3. Reminds me of a time when I could keep you safe. It's beautiful, dad. Thank you. You wanted to see me? Oh, yeah. Hey. Agent Grace. Listen, I was doing some housekeeping... logging aliases, safe house authorizations, family contacts... you know, the sucky part of my job. And I came across a mistake in your file, so I contacted Langley. Turns out I don't have proper clearance to do my own job. What did you find? Marriage certificate from seven years ago. Listen, if it's to support an outdated alias, I'd probably have it rescinded sooner than later. - You know, tax issues... - It's not a mistake. I was married. Really? I'm sorry. I never heard you mention that. For 3 years. Didn't work out. Totally understand. I mean, it's a... it's a struggle. Hey, do me a favor. Next time you have a question about my personal life, why don't you call me before Langley? Absolutely. I'm... really sorry. I'll get Jack. 4 hours ago, an agency facility storing closed matters was breached. Security cameras identified the perpetrator as an operative of Prophet 5. - Kelly Peyton. - Do we know what she took? Among the archives were files of all our agents killed in the line of duty... their contact protocols, audio field journals, biometric readouts... They were Vaughn's files, weren't they? You were going to have to say it eventually. Yes, that's right. Why would they want Vaughn's files? It's unclear at the moment, which leaves us in a vulnerable position. Vaughn's investigation of Prophet 5 was off the books. It's unlikely he kept those records in a C.I.A. file. I've tasked Tom and Marshall with disabling all of Vaughn's official protocols. I'd like you to locate any of his old contacts and issue a warning. Sloane will oversee Rachel in analyzing the remainder of the intel. Me? Though I would prefer to keep you close by, I know that's not an option. Given her intimate knowledge of Prophet 5 and her association with Vaughn, you should meet with Renée Rienne, see if she has any idea what they may be looking for. Yeah, okay. Sydney? You should know, when it comes to Vaughn, I take it quite personally. I know, dad. We're going to fix this. Anything? - Listen to this. - The location? Not quite, but I think Vaughn shared it with Sydney Bristow. ...and I met this afternoon to discuss the protocol for her SD-6 countermissions. I briefed agent Bristow on the full scope of their operation, how far it reaches. Go back. I briefed agent Bristow on the full scope of their operation, how far it reaches. She knows where it is. And you're certain agent Vaughn communicated this intelligence to her? Yes, according to his own C.I.A. reports. But it was several years ago. There's no guarantee Sydney will remember. That's of no concern. An associate of mine will be able to refresh her memory. I'll forward you the contact protocol for Dr. Gonzalo Burris. He's going to ask for a lot of money. Tell him you'll pay half. Have him waiting for me at the Athena facility. Then you're suggesting that we abduct Sydney Bristow, which, you realize, may compromise our larger agenda? We've been searching for more than 30 years, and this is the closest we've come to retrieving the Horizon. If Sydney bristow can tell us where it is, we must act immediately. It's a chance we have to take. Hello, Renée. You look beautiful. Doctor said it's my last week to fly. Which means this is a special visit. Prophet Five is targeting some of Vaughn's C.I.A. files. I need to know... did he make a record of your investigation? No. It was all in our heads. Well, then was there anything that Vaughn was working on or any leads or contacts that might be of value to Prophet Five now? What's in the files? Presumably, everything he worked on... SD-6, the Covenant, the Alliance... Then no. It's impossible. All the way back to SD-6, he was only investigating... Where did you park? - I walked. Why? - Let's move. There's a police center on the corner. You'll be safe. Just take it easy. It might be nothing. Go! Sydney! You. Where are they taking her? Where are they taking her?! I've just sedated her with a propofol cocktail which should take full effect within minutes. It's a chemical process of forced hypnosis which will effectively numb the body but leave the mind partially lucid, allowing me to access any part of her memory you'd like. Which means it's now time that you tell me what it is you're looking for. First, I'd like some proof that this technique will work. Of course. Tell me your name. Tell me your name. Sydney Bristow. That's a girl. Sydney, I want you to remember Michael Vaughn. Find him. Find him and remember a time when you were both happy, a time that was meaningful. Go back, Sydney. Find him. Vaughn... I had it all planned out. Vaughn? No, just please let me do this. Do what? I was going to take you to the beach, Santa Barbara. We'd go for a walk, maybe during a sunset. But now we're here, and I have no idea what we're about to jump into, and I don't know if I'll ever get another chance to do this. But, Vaughn, we already did this. I don't understand. I think I do. The people you were looking for, the people behind Prophet Five... I think they're holding me. How do you know about Prophet Five? You told me, and then they shot you. What? They shot me? No, I'm here. I know. They injected me with something. They hypnotized me. They're trying to get something out of my head. - What? - I don't know. But I think they're trying to use you against me. Stay with Vaughn, Sydney. Remember the love you feel for him. - I should go. - No. I don't want to be without you. I know. I miss you. Look. Sydney Bristow, will you marry me? I don't know what I'm supposed to say. You're supposed to say yes. Yes. I want to marry you. Okay, we've got it. Now perhaps you should tell me what we're looking for. There's a call for you on the overseas line. They're following our contact protocol, but I don't recognize the voice. This is the Director. Is this Sydney Bristow's father? Prophet Five has Sydney. She was last seen in a black van heading west away from the Salamanca quarter. Rachel, access Madrid's surveillance infrastructure. Marshall, monitor all movement through local ports and airspace. - What's the timeline? - She was abducted 40 minutes ago. Well, they could've had her to the city limits in 20. - Then move! - Right. We're assuming Sydney's capture is connected to something Prophet Five found in Vaughn's files. I'll reassess them with that in mind. Dr. Aldo Desantis was present at the ambush, which implies they may intend to use Sydney for a medical procedure. My God. The baby. Renée Rienne has Desantis in custody. I'm gonna join her and assist with the interrogation. Do you want me to come with you? No. I need you to run operations until I return. I'll secure a flight to Spain for you. Where do you need me? You're sure you have no means left by which to contact Prophet Five? Jack, I told you that Gordon Dean was my only resource. With him dead, I have nothing. Okay. Then use your underworld contacts. The news of a federal agent in captivity may have made the rounds. See if they know anything. I'll get right on it. This is Arvin Sloane. I'd like to speak to Mr. Ehrmann. Mr. Ehrmann is not available. This is an urgent matter. I need to speak to him. You're not playing by the rules, Mr. Sloane. Remember, we contact you. A pregnant woman's life is at stake... someone very dear to me. The only woman you can save is lying in a hospital bed. May I suggest you pick your battles, sir? - Please. - Good-bye, Mr. Sloane. Jack? Do you have anything? Satellites lost her at the city limits. If we don't get him to a hospital, he's gonna die. Has he given us anything? He won't talk, but I pulled this from his jacket. It's got dates, addresses. So this is how you do it... bring in a man in a suit... to scare me into talking? You're right. The suit shouldn't scare you. What should scare you is that I'm a very concerned father. No! I'm going to continue the regressive process... attaching her to a memory of Vaughn and then taking her back through time until we get your answer. Now, Sydney, I want you to remember the last time you were with Vaughn. Think of the comfort you feel when you're with him. Live there... in your memories. Vaughn? Vaughn? Sorry. I guess I drifted off there. Hey, we should think about more names for the baby. There will be plenty of time for that. I know. What do you think about Oscar? - What if we have a girl? - I meant for a girl. I wish she were here already. - I want to meet her. - You will. I know. Are you comfortable? No. When he feels ready, make sure he drinks it slow. Don't overdo it. Just a sip at a time. - I'll be back soon. - Thank you. Can I... I'm thirsty. I gave you this, and then you crashed. - Vaughn... I can't. - Syd... They can hear us. Come closer. You said it yourself... they're using me against you. The only way to defeat them... I need to go away. I don't care. I don't want to say good-bye to you again. I know. I know. It's okay. I need to go away. We'll find each other. We always find each other. Syd? The baby kicked. Really? What's it feel like? Here. - I don't feel anything. - Wait. There. - No, I... that? - Yeah. Very good, Sydney. I want you to stay with Vaughn. - Don't ever leave me. - Never. - Where are they taking us? - Nowhere good. Syd? Vaughn? Don't let him go. I want you to stay with Vaughn, Sydney. Sydney, can you hear me? Vaughn, where are you? I'm losing... go to chann... Vaughn? Vaughn! Don't let him leave you, Sydney. Where is Vaughn? I'm back. What took you so long? They're back together. Tell me where they have my daughter. I'll tell you nothing. You've been shot. You'll never survive the blood loss. Though I am prepared to draw this out to the last second, make it as painful as it needs to be, until you tell me where she is. Where she is does not matter. Your concern should be where she is going. Jack? I found a repeating address in the calendar. "Kristina Korut 37/E." That's in Hungary. He had it marked three times in the last fourth months and once on this date, three weeks from now. Jack, what is it? That's Sydney's due date. Give me your gun. What's gonna happen at Kristina Korut 37/e? You'll never know. Is Sydney being held there? - Of course not. - You're lying. Very well. Maybe I am lying. What's there? You can't do anything to me now. I'm quite prepared to die. See if he means it. Dixon, it's Jack. I need you to prepare a transport to Hungary. Sydney, think back to a comforting time... the place you were the first time you realized that Vaughn really cared for you. I forget how beautiful it is... the ocean. Yeah. We should have come here more often. Draw me a map... how far it reaches. - They're pushing me closer. - What do they want? I don't know. - Something about a map. - A map? Listen to me. Draw me a map... how far it reaches. You just threw your phone into the pacific... twice. I know. Listen to me. You have got to let me go. - I can't. - You have to. I can't, Vaughn. I can't stand it... - being here without you. - Sydney... I feel like I'm losing my mind. I do. Like I don't know who I am anymore or what I'm doing or why I'm doing it. Okay, stop. Do you remember the last time we were here? Your contact had just been killed in Morocco, and your world was collapsing around you. And I told you that even in the middle of all this darkness, you could not allow it to swallow you. You gave me strength. Yeah, but the truth is... the truth has always been you are the one that has kept the darkness from overtaking me. You can do this. I know you can do this. I've seen you do this time and time again. I'm gonna go... and you are gonna take these guys down. Okay? She's fighting the process. I want you to stay with Vaughn, Sydney. If you don't say good-bye to me, they win. I can't do it on my own. I'm not here. This isn't real. None of this is real. It's real to me. That's all that matters. Don't say that. That's what they want you to say. Do you know what I want? I want the world to forget about us. I'm tired, Vaughn. I'm tired of having this weight on my shoulders. I don't want to be the one who has to save the world. I want you back. I want you all to myself. I want to go away, just you and me and our baby, somewhere no one can bother us... a deserted island. I want out. I don't care if they win, Vaughn. I don't care. I just want you to stay with me. That's it. We got her. Excellent. Now I want the map of SD-6. I want no more of this spy crap. I just... that's why I went to you in the first place. So just listen to me, and I will give you, in record time, the names of people who will render SD-6 useless. Record time? Two months tops, and then I'm out. I walk. Draw me a map of SD-6 and all its allies, how far you think it reaches. Draw me an SD-6 family tree and how deep you think it goes. Just do it. This is what you're in the middle of. This isn't about cutting off an arm of the monster. This is about killing the monster. Focus on the map. The upper right corner... what do you see? There's a name. What is it? Tell me what it is. X-23 Norte. Well done. Well done. Good... Thank you, doctor. I'll let my associates know we've discovered the location of the Horizon. I'll be back in a few days. Until then, keep her comfortable. Do you hear that? I didn't hear anything. I know. It's great, isn't it? I wish we could stay here like this forever. There's nothing I want more. They're gonna figure it out, Syd. Sooner or later, they're gonna know you gave'em the wrong name. And when they do, I can't be here. They'll keep using me against you. They won't stop until they get what they want. I have to go. I know. We'll find each other. We always find each other. Unit three is on the third floor. The lease expired 16 years ago. Nevertheless. Good Lord. Translation : Anyone Sixe Guilamu
