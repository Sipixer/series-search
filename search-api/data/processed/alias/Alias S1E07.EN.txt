called SD-6. I was sworn to secrecy but I couldn't keep it from my fianc√©. When the head of SD-6 found out, he had him killed. That's when I learned the truth. SD-6 is not part of the CIA. I'd been working for the people I thought I was fighting against. So I went to the only place that could help me take them down. Now I'm a double agent for the CIA. My handler is a man named Michael Vaughn. Only one other person knows the truth about me. Another double agent inside SD-6. Someone I hardly know. My father. Mr Tippin? I'm Kate Jones. Danny and I had an affair. I knew he was seeing someone but I wasn't really thinking so much about her. Here's what doesn't make any sense. I did a trace on you. Kate Jones. You died in 1973. - I have to go. - Who the hell are you? Oh, no. That leak. The glitch. There's a worm, a hacker on the network. They're downloading files. Gotta cut the hard line. Hello, Alain? We need to meet. I think we have a mole. Parkashoff was assassinated by Martin Shepard. Shepard checked into a mental institution in southern Romania. Get close enough to Shepard and get him to tell you where Parkashoff is buried. Agent Fisher will be your support on this. His alias is Dr Carlos Fontanetta. Fisher? Jack, I thought you should know, Sydney and Fisher missed their scheduled contact. What are you thinking? Worst case is they're not alone in there. Maybe someone posing as a patient or a doctor. Come on, Jack. Sydney's a smart kid. We've seen her through worse than this. Maybe not. Maybe not. But I believe in her. I believe in her as if she were my own daughter. That's nice to hear. - When's her next scheduled contact? - Ten hours. Then we'll know how hot the water is. Let us not waste time. I know that you work for SD-6. I know that you are here to find out where Martin Shepard buried Parkashoff. That you need Parkashoff's DNA to read FTL code. What I do not know is whether you have succeeded. Since we're not playing games, which is refreshing, I'd like to know who's asking. My affiliation is unimportant. You have until the machine charges. Answer my question. Wait. This can't be the best version of this conversation. Shepard didn't talk. I don't know where Parkashoff is buried. Wait. I'm telling you. I don't know anything. Wait! Mr Bristow. Your usual table is waiting for you, sir. Thank you, Joey. Mr Bristow, sorry about... - Who are you? - I'm CIA. Operations Officer Vaughn. Sydney's handler. I cleared this meet with Devlin. Kretchmer walked me through your SOP. We're safe. Are Sydney and I switching handlers or is this a special occasion? - We have a problem. - Fisher hasn't made contact. We believe K-Directorate had an agent waiting in the hospital. SD-6 does not have confirmation of that. The CIA does. We have an extraction team on the ready line out of Serbia. I want to pull Sydney out. I was hoping that maybe we could co-ordinate this together. Mr Vaughn, you're young. You're eager. I understand that. One thing you're not, and this is something only time can provide, really, is wise. - You don't think this is right? - Listen carefully, Mr Vaughn. Even with a minimal extraction team, you can't guarantee containment. - If Sloane finds out, Sydney dies. - Retire her. End her service. Expose your operation at SD-6? - Sydney's life is worth the risk. - Not to Sydney. Taking them down is what gets her up in the morning. Or did you think it was those meetings she has with you? - What is your problem with me? - You pulled my file last week. That's my problem, Mr Vaughn. Did curiosity get the better of you? Or were you trying to impress my daughter? She thinks you were KGB. But I'm sure you knew that. So I'm wondering, what were you doing checking up on me checking up on you? This meeting is over. You can't torture Shepard for information. Electroshock won't work. FTL trained him to forget everything he did. That's why you're here posing as his shrink. You're K-Directorate. What makes you think I work with K-Directorate? Your accent's Georgian. Georgia, former Soviet Union. Their main recruiting ground. Shepard thinks I'm a patient. He's more likely to trust me. Except he has already attacked you. Which I can use to seal his transference, by bringing his guilt to the surface then forgiving him. I suppose you'd like your life in return? If you get Shepard to recall the location of Parkashoff, you might just live out your life in a Chechnyan internment camp. You have until lockdown tonight. Stay away from me. I'm here to help you. I don't want your help. I'm not open to your help. I think I know what's happening to you. I'm sure you do. Because you're one of them. You know the words that are going on in my head. I know. I've seen you somewhere before. - I've seen you. - No, you haven't. I'm safe here. Safe here. I thought I was safe. What I'm about to say to you is the truth. You gotta listen to me. They are gonna kill us both if we don't help each other to get out of here. Then you have a real problem. Because I'm not leaving here. I would rather die... ...than leave the way I am now. Do you have the chart Dr Kreshnik asked for? Yellow sky. Interesting choice. I told you to stay away from me. I know that you're starting to remember some things. I know you think I had something to do with them, but I didn't. Piss off. You can't see colours? Who are you? If you're not one of them, then how do you know that? I'll tell you what you need to know. But first you have to help me. I was sent here to get information but I don't care about that any more. All I care about is that the main exit door has a dual-key lock. That means two people using two keys at the same time to open it. - I'm not leaving here. - Please believe me. Other people want to find out what's in your head. When they don't, they will kill us both. You want me to believe you but don't tell me anything. I know... I've seen you somewhere. Look. You were trained... You were programmed to follow orders. Whose orders? Whose orders? To do what? To do...? To kill. - No. - The things you remember are real. I know it's hard to hear. Accept that you did these things. I'd rather be crazy, then. When you're following orders, you're trained to see in black-and-white, to keep you detached from what you do. You're not supposed to remember but you are. Your training must be short-circuiting. What you did is so painful to remember you see black-and-white all the time, as a defence mechanism. But it's good, you're starting to heal. Stop it, please. Guard! Take him. Lockdown. Tell Dr Kreshnik... ...I have the information he needs. A memo from Legal about reporters quoting other reporters. - What's it say? - "Cut it out." - Happy Thanksgiving. - Thanks, Jenny. Davis, scroll down a second. - Did you get the memo? - Show me the picture. Alright. Jeez. Her name was Eloise Kurtz, local girl, found shot to death in Echo Park. Do you know her? She called herself Kate Jones, not Eloise Kurtz. She was my source about Danny Hecht. She was involved somehow. She was trying to tell me something. You're not hearing me. I'm not saying... You won't publish this even though there are now two murders? The fastest way to be discredited is to author a conspiracy theory without background. Believe me, you might as well publish your own homepage. But will you at least take a look at my notes? Leave them on my desk when you go. I'm not telling you to drop this, I'm not being a monster. I'm telling you to bring it back more developed. My God. - Ferroq, report. - We are coming, Doctor. What is that tattoo on your arm? Special Forces? I almost got a tattoo once. I was on the guy's chair. Take her. Hurts, doesn't it? You're right. I don't want to die here. - How'd you get out of your room? - I was quite good. I pretended to swallow my tongue and lifted the RN's keys. Look at me. You can do this. You think I'd help you out if I thought you'd kill someone? Unless you're planning on killing me. Why would I do that? Sorry. Get in. Seatbelt. Whoa, company. Here, I'm totally a mess in here. Sorry. I wasn't expecting anyone. Do you wanna have a seat? I have a minor form of scoliosis. The air ergonomically hugs me. You want to stretch out? I can inflate the couch. I'll stand. By the way, I scanned every byte of the computer network. No more virus, that leak is plugged. Even better, as it exported files at a low bandwidth... Marshall, the virus was a security section drill. A drill? - Like a test? - You were the only one to catch it. Faster than anyone anticipated. So good work. It transmitted over an unsecured connection. Isn't that risky? Security Section was surveilling it the whole time. I just wanted to let you know. Thanks. - Yes? - Dad, where's Vaughn? I had his number forwarded. Are you alright? - I'm at the safe house. - Any trouble finding it? Only took six hours driving in the dark. Is Shepard with you? Get to Rinas airport in Tirana. There's a charter flight waiting under Kraja Petrol Corp. The hardest part's over. We'll talk when you get back. Why me? Why did you ever come talk to me? - I was looking for a man. - Who? A man who you killed and buried. His name was Gareth Parkashoff. That's what I was sent in to find. A man I killed? The first time I had the images in my head it was like... ...a seizure. Flashes of people, places... ...a street sign. I thought I was remembering bad dreams. It was in black-and-white, but it was so vivid. I didn't know how much of it was real. I found the street. I heard there had been a murder. A shopkeeper recognised me. I was convinced I was delusional. I couldn't be a killer, I couldn't be. Where you found me was... ...as... remote a place as I could find to lock myself away in case... ...in case I was wrong. It's not your fault. I feel like I've been stolen... ...from myself. I don't know if there was ever a me. I don't know who... Please tell me who you are, Sydney. Maybe that will... How did you know my name? How did you know my name? The banner. What banner? It said, "Happy Birthday, Sydney." I heard the water... running. I'm so... sorry. The man you were ordered to kill was my fianc√©. His name was Danny. I told Danny... ...l'm a spy. Because he was the one part of my life I couldn't stand to be a lie. And when SD-6 found out they called on one of their hit men, someone they'd already enlisted. They called on you. I think the man who programmed you is named McCullough. - He's their neurotech. - McCullough? He's in here. The irony is, they never lied about what would happen if I told someone. It was the one thing they said that turned out to be true. Now I'm a double agent for the CIA. And I will be until SD-6 is gone. Will... ...finding where Parkashoff is buried... ...help you to take down the people that did this to us? Yes. I left his body in marshland. The Louisiana-Texas border. Off the l-ten. So that's the deal? Shepard wrote down the location of Parkashoff's body. In exchange I helped him escape the asylum. I see. Where is Shepard now? He committed suicide. Something went wrong. He started remembering what he had done. He snapped. When we were crossing the border into Bulgaria... ...he jumped. Threw himself off the bridge into Lake Scutari. There is no way he could've survived. If by some miracle he did survive, we'll hear about it sooner or later. I told SD-6 Shepard was dead. I was gonna lie to you about it too, but the truth is... ...I can't stand lying to anyone else. I appreciate that. I'll be honest. Some people at the agency will want him found. He's as much a victim of SD-6 as I am. Shepard buried Parkashoff's body in a Louisiana marshland. Sloane sent out a forensics team to get a DNA sample. They should be able to decode the FTL message by tonight. - We were worried. - The CIA hates to lose its assets. I mean, I was worried. For you. In fact, I... I contacted your father. Just so you know... ...he knows I pulled his file and suspects you've seen it. It's OK. It's me. That's what I thought. Seems our SD-6 computer virus is turning into a gold mine. Good. Maybe we can get ahead of them for once. Why don't you go home, get some rest? Happy Thanksgiving. Oh, God. OK, were you ever gonna call me back? Sorry. Where the hell were you? I left three messages. - My trip was extended. - You can't just disappear. - What's burning? - Just an oven fire. - I just moved in. - I fricasseed the turkey. Are you OK? I'm glad to be home. OK, but the turkey's really burning. Everything's burning. Greasy steam. What'd you do? This is Jenny. She works with me. Thanks for letting me crash your party. I would have totally brought some wine but I got carded. So, cider. Cider's perfect, thank you. Come in. You look great. Is this the sweater I got you? That's not why I wore it. I'm gonna go put that on ice. - She's cute. - Yeah. It's our new intern. Her parents were in Europe so I felt bad. That's Jenny? - It's strictly professional. - Really? - What are you saying? - Nothing. Happy Thanksgiving. Cheers. Are your parents really away? Somebody's always gotta bang the glass. This year it's me. I wanted all of you to be here for what I'm about to do, which is probably going to be one of the most embarrassing moments ever. This thing is burning a hole in my pocket. The last stop, baby. Will you marry me? Yes. Yes, Charlie, I will. OK, watch your tongue. Glad you're taking it slow. Dad. This was on your lawn. It's my neighbour's. I'll give it to him. - Do you...? - Shepard killed Danny. I'm assuming you know that. If I hadn't, thank you for breaking it to me so gently. I'm telling you because I don't want you to think it's my mission in life to keep things from you. Then why do you? FBI report, signed by the Deputy Director, clearing me of having any involvement with the KGB. You have to understand it was the height of the Cold War. After they caught Boyce and Lee in '77, everybody was under suspicion. So I suppose, in a way... ...your mother's accident was my fault, since the FBI was after me. If I could give her back to you, I would. Take it. I don't need to. - You should stay. - Work. I'm glad your trip went well. Happy Thanksgiving. You too. We found Parkashoff's body and ran a DNA sample through the genetic decoder you obtained. It decoded the FTL communiqu√©. Here's the full text. Possible location of Rambaldi Artefact discovered in Tunisia. Dig proceeding. Now we know where those FTL agents went off to in such a hurry. - So I'm off to Tunisia? - Actually, no. We sent an advance team there on a recon mission. But the dig had been evacuated. FTL must have found whatever was buried there. We traced a shipment out of El Kef to the Department of Engineering Science at Oxford. FTL has no idea what they've uncovered or else they wouldn't send it to civilians for analysis. But whatever it is, some of the best minds in the world are studying it as we speak. The University holds a reception for visiting professors tomorrow night. You're going as a scout for the Marisa Foundation, looking for grant candidates. Keep in mind that FTL is likely to have a large presence to make sure that we don't try what we are about to try. In the interest of fairness, I reread your notes. There wasn't much there. You need more shoe leather to go with the story you're looking for. You're right. I think it's better to drop it. You've got enough for a piece on why the police are not more curious. So take it from that angle. We go to press on Tuesday. Wait. I'm not... I mean... Thank you. Tuesday? Is that, like, set? Will, are you on dope? 24 hours ago, you were begging me to publish. OK. Here's the thing. Danny Hecht. The murder that started this, he's my friend's... He was my friend's fianc√©. I'm having second thoughts. She doesn't know about the story. I think she'd want it investigated. I did tell her, a while ago. She asked me to drop it. I don't want to hurt her. I'm genuinely sorry to hear that. This is now a legitimate piece. If you don't want it, it goes to somebody else. Don't chicken out on me now. Whatever the Rambaldi Artefact is, the CIA wants photographs. Do it in your hotel room. We'll plant a mini-camera in the Bible. There's one more thing. One of our Romanian assets spotted Anna Espinosa leaving the psychiatric hospital after you escaped. Be careful. She's on this. How was your Thanksgiving? Good. My friend got engaged. What's her name? - How was yours? - Typical. Spent it with my mom. - What about...? Is it Alice? - Yeah, we broke up. The security section has made us aware of the concern that you may have a mole in your department. It would appear so. Some in the alliance believe you may have more than one. Well, if that's true McCullough will draw them out. It is our intention
