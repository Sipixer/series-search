My jet got bouncy out of Newark. Not to be a pain in the shaker, but can we cut to the dessert? By all means, please. This is Leon. Hey, how you doing? Leon Frost. CPA of V.I.P. That's a nice suit. - Thanks, Leon. - So, can we do business? Yes, I'm sure this is the right bank. Please check it again. Roger Fonseca. Have you never heard of the Fonseca vineyards? No. Please, check it again. F-O-N-S-E-C-A, like it says on the passport. You guarantee my name can't be traced to my account number? Not that I have anything to hide or anything. The names of all the account holders are stored exclusively in my personal safe right here. It's a Manheim. Protected biometrically. It's good enough for three ex-presidents, I guess it's good enough for a plumber's wife. Now, the minimum deposit that I mentioned. Leon. That would be my department. And... Excellent. All right, uh, your full name. Claudia Maria Vasquez Demarco. - That's a lovely name. - Charmed, I'm sure. This is ridiculous. I'm gonna start getting upset if you don't find my account information now. Your manager will not be happy to lose my business. Excuse me, please, miss. You can tell me where I can go to cash this check. I'm doing business here, Brady. Go bother someone else. Is it me you are talking to like that, mon? Yes, mon, it is. And I'm not in a good mood, so just walk away. Boy, you need more peace in your life, brother. Maybe you need a hearing aid, and I'm not your brother, so shove off. Break it off. Guard! This is your account number, and that's your name -- in code, of course. Yes? Excuse me. I'll be right back in one minute. No problem. We'll hold down the fort. Anybody tries to steal anything from you -- - Leon! - Oh. Sorry. Scanning the database records. Break it up! Break it up! Break it up! What's the account number? 1-4-2-0-5-4-3-0-2-0-2-0-2- 0-2-0-2-2-2-0-6-9-6-3-5. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Pardon me for that. Sorry. I apologize. Got it. What were you doing? Just... breaking into your safe. You almost fooled me. Thanks for coming. Come on in. Right here, please. Hungry. What? I'm starving. You're taking three. - These are for my kids. - Well, these are for Mitchell. Your son is 14 months old. Is that too young to have pizza? Hey, thanks for inviting us. So, I think something's going on between my sister and the birthday boy. Yeah, I've been watching, and I can tell you, that's not a great thing. Why not? Well, 'cause the same thing happens every time. He gets way too eager, the girl breaks his heart, and I have to clean it up. Don't be a cynic. - Pizza and vegetables? - I know. We should go some time. No woman ever wants to go to the magic castle. I like magic. And I like your smile, too. This one right here? - This smile? - Yeah, that one. How red is my face right now? - Very red. - Yeah. Hey, guys. How's it going? - Hey. Very well. - Easy, Tiger. Oh, no, I'm on fire, my friend. She loves magic. Do you think people are having fun? - Hey! - Whoa! You're so old. Dude, you're so bald. What's up, man? I'm so glad you're here. These are friends of mine. This is Sydney. And Nadia. - How you doing? - Hi, nice to meet you. And, uh... - Michael? - Right. - How you doing, man? - Nice to meet you. I used to work with these guys until they went private sector on me. What do you do now? I work in a bank -- in the loan department. Looks  like the party just got started. Hey, mr. Bristow. Want some pizza or a cocktail? D ad. It must have been lost in the mail. Your invitation? Unless it was an e-vite. I don't read e-vites. Your mission last week in the Bahamas paid off. We know who has the Valta. That's what you came here to tell me? There's a briefing in the morning. I know. I've learned that you invited your sister to live here. I'm letting her stay here, yes. Are you aware that Sloane has Langley's approval to make her a permanent member of our team at A.P.O.? If you're wondering whether I've told Nadia that you killed our mother, no, I haven't. But I plan to. - Out of spite? - Out of respect. Sydney, consider the ramifications. She's my sister. I need to tell her the truth. This isn't about what you need, Sydney. No, apparently it's about what you need. You don't know how Nadia may react to that information. Which will be especially true if she finds out from another source. I needn't remind you that your sister has sworn to kill the man responsible for your mother's death. - Hey. - Hi. Syd, where are the candles? These guys want to do the cake. - I'll be right there. - Okay. Trust me, dad, I don't look forward to telling Nadia what you did or why you did it. But she will learn the truth somehow, and I would rather it be from me. 10 days ago, the Valta computer was stolen in broad daylight as it was being transferred to NSA headquarters. Now, the Valta represents cutting-edge technology. It will revolutionize information gathering from satellite networks. - If it falls in the wrong hands -- - It would be like monster bad. Simply put, we cannot let the Valta be delivered. Delivered to whom? A new terrorist network out of Germany -- the Badenliga. The theft was financed by transferring 3 million euros into an untraceable account in the Bahamas. Your work has given us the name of that account -- Martin Bishop. Intel indicates that Bishop is still waiting to receive final payment before he delivers the Valta. Then we need to get to Bishop right away. What do we know about him? He's a British ex-pat living in Spain. He has a reputation as a ladykiller -- literally. His wife disappeared three years ago. Rumor has it that he killed her to spend more time with his mistress. Charming. Professionally, Bishop specializes in acquiring high-risk, high-reward military targets. The Valta must be recovered or destroyed. I want you to find it. That'll be all. Sydney. Thank you. For  what? For letting my daughter stay with you. As Nadia acclimates to this life, to her new family, she needs support, and you have put my mind at ease. The thought that I did something that might have given you a warm and fuzzy feeling makes me want to kick my own sister out of my house. Yeah. Well, Nadia won't be assisting you on the Bishop case. Now that she's joining our team, your father has offered to run her through her psych evaluation. Really? The Yakahoshi review can predict how an individual will react to highly stressful situations and the discovery of delicate intel. Delicate intel? Sydney, I'm resigned to the fact that you're going to tell Nadia what happened, but when are you going to do that? Now? Two hours before you leave for an operation? Not until I get back. Understood. And I agree. It's for the best. What are you up to, dad? They're waiting for you, Sydney. Nadia. Is he always so cold? Jack? I'm afraid so. So, I was wondering, are you free tonight? There's this restaurant on Melrose. It serves Argentinean food. We can go any place you'd like. I'd like that. Good. I'll see you when you're through. Okay. Great. I'll check that out with the NSA. Intel indicates Bishop owns a dozen industrial properties in Spain. Any one of them could be a safe hiding place for the Valta. Bishop also recently purchased an MK-1200 from Cheline Tech. Well, you don't buy a server like that to look at online porn. No, you buy it to coordinate international business operations. At least that's what it's made for. Logistics, essentially. So let's assume the location of the Valta is on that server. And the server's on his estate. An hour out of Malaga. A couple hundreds acres. And you can't hack into an MK-1200 from the outside, FYI. Okay, so what if you're on the inside? Multiple electric fences, cameras on high sweep, armed guards, comm jammers. Well, if you can get past all that, I've got this really cool laser lock pick that will help you hack into the server. It's housed in this watch that's awesomely designed by me, Marshall J. Flinkman. Except I'm still working on that overheating problem -- So we need to get into that house, get into the server, and that will tell us where he's hiding the Valta. How do you break into the house of a master thief? I don't think you do. I think you have to be invited. Ok, they're approaching. I've locked onto the cell phone frequencies. All set. Pull over. Marshall,  can you flip that? Oh sorry. Okay. Cell phones are jammed. - Hey, it's not igniting. - What? All right, hold on a sec. Sometimes you just need a little magic touch. And... Fire! Help! Help! I can't get my seatbelt off! Are you all right? No, my seat belt's stuck. Please, sir, please hurry. - Can you move? - Please, my seatbelt right here! Please! Call for help! I can't get my seatbelt off! Please, sir, please! It's stuck! - Please, please, please... - It's stuck. Trigger the belt. What, you don't want to milk this a little bit? Marshall, do it. Sorry. You don't have to get so snappy. And now for the big finish -- Rock 'n roll Cleveland! Ahh! - Sir, are you okay? - I'm fine. - What about you? - Yeah. Sir, I can't get a signal. I don't know what's wrong. Please don't call anybody. Please. You just rolled your car. You must have been going at 200 kilometers an hour. Sometimes you need to drive fast. So why are you in such a rush? Long story. This guy scares me. I mean, he killed his wife. He's a wife-killer. Beat her to death, stuffed her in a dumpster, who kowns what else? Marshall, shut up. Where you headed? You just saved my life. Perhaps I did. I'm quite something, aren't I? To me you are. You know, a doctor should really look at -- No. I'm fine. Look, I just need a place to rest. I haven't slept much the past few days, that's all. I'm fine. I live near here. I'm taking you back to my house. Okay. Outrigger to Base. Phoenix is in. She's on her own. Shotgun to Base. We're on position. We're still on schedule. Outrigger's patching us into the grid. We'll have laser mike operational in five minutes. Affirmative, Shotgun. We're standing by for your information Roger that. Are you sure we can't use standard comms? No, Bishop is using at least four high-impedance jammers. Okay,  to burrow a hole through that kind of noise, Sydney would have to wear a generator the size of a baby hippopotamus. You know, and that's certainly no way to sneak around somebody's house, with a baby hippopotamus strapped to your... back. Good luck. It's a nice shower. Yeah? Good. I'm glad you liked it. How are you feeling? Fine. Grateful. No more thanks. You're a good excuse to get to know my house. I haven't been in this room in three years. Three years? Not since my wife left me. I'm sorry to hear about it. It's in the past. Yeah? Your shoulder. It's nothing. All of this didn't come from the accident. It's fine. Who are you running from? Your wife left you. I left someone. Only he didn't want me to go. Who is he? I can have someone talk to him. I'm all right. Now I'm all right. I'll just have to remember not to wear something strapless. I have some business in town. Stay here, Charlene, and rest. When I get back, we'll have dinner. My car's totaled. I'm not going anywhere. Thank you, Martin. Oh stay inside. Don't wander the grounds. There's... security. I'll stay put. You might need to wake me when you get back. I look forward to it. You've been sent to Paris to extract a deep-cover operative. You've successfully transferred him to a safe house on Ile st. Louis when a secure communication comes in that you've been exposed. Do you abort? Well, that depends if he's -- What's your impulse? That's what this is about. - Is the operative one of us? - Yes or no? No. While tapping a phone line of a target in New Delhi, you're spotted by the enemy. Your partner tells you to continue with the mission objective while he neutralizes the target. Do you obey him or fight back? Is the phone system the new PBX matrix? Just answer the question, please. Why is my partner a man? The sex of your partner is irrelevant. Oh. No, I would not obey. I'd help her fight him off. Then she and I could finish the job together. Jack? How's she doing? I don't quite know yet. Oh, come on, Jack. It's been two hours. You must have formed an opinion. I have, but I need to be certain. Of course. Shotgun to Phoenix. How do you read? This is so weird. It sounds like you're right next to me. - You can hear me? - No. Good. It's like talking to my conscience. It is a little bit, isn't it? Merlin, what's your status? Give me a sec. Okay, uh... Okay, let me see. Okay, we've got a huge power drain in the basement. It's the room at the far southern end. Copy that. Phoenix, your target is in the basement. Southernmost room. It looks like an office. Rendezvous at the far window on the first floor. Move on my mark. I see two visible bogeys, one on the third floor, one below. Okay, you're clear. Go. I was upside down, and the seatbelt wouldn't come undone. And the car was blazing. Joss -- Joss, calm down. I'll tell you. He pulled me out. And we just got free, and the thing blew up. Huge. - We're good. - Good. Move fast. Come on, come on, come on. I found the Valta. It's located at Alameda yards. I.D. Number is Charlie-0717. Okay, the coast is clear. Get out of there. I'll see you at the extraction point. - Sydney's on her way. - On our way for pickup. This is Arvin Sloane. Requested intel has been acquired. Valta is located in container I.D. Charlie-0717 in Alameda yards. Wait. Stand down. - What? - What is it? I saw you pull in. You seem out of breath. I'm just glad you're back. Really? This way. We've got a problem. You're one of a three-man team -- three-woman team, if you prefer. A tactical mission. You suspect that one of your team members may be a mole. Do you tell the third? Hmm. No. You return from an operation overseas. While the mission was successful, certain information may reflect negatively on one of your team members. Do you include said information in your op report? No. Mr. Bristow? Yes? I don't mean to seem impatient, but I've never done anything that's lasted as long as this. How sad for you. Jack Bristow. We're through. I gave Langley the location of the Valta. Are they acting on it? They have a team standing by in Malaga. They're about to raid one of Bishop's truck yards. What about Sydney? She's still in the house with Bishop. Is her cover blown? I don't know. Can we extract her? Not yet. Langley considers the raid top priority. We have the authority to seize Bishop only after the Valta is secured or destroyed. I'm sorry, Jack, but I just thought that you should know. Then I'm going to Spain myself, and I'd like to take Nadia with me. Uh, about that -- have you learned anything helpful? Enough. Enough to deal with the problem at hand. It occurred to me that this night represents things I've been considering for some time. How's that? The choices I make. People with whom I choose to keep company. Work versus... everything else. If you can hear me, tuck your hair behind your ear. Sounds like a mid-existential crisis. Yes. That's it. Okay, Langley's ordered a raid on the Alameda yard. You have got to get out of there. It's easy to doubt yourself, but sometimes you need to stick with it and stay the course. Damn it, no. You've got to get out of there. When Bishop hears about the raid, he'll suspect you. But I think in my case, it might be time to make a mid-course correction. The fact is, I don't believe in coincidence. Meaning what? You and I were destined to meet? Possibly. But I'm more interested to know why we met. I told you, I was involved with the wrong man. I don't believe that. Let's move! Move, move! Go. Call one in position. Fan out. Everyone get back, right now! Fall back! Cover me! I don't get it. Why doesn't she just kick his ass, you know, and then run? She doesn't want to blow her cover. Wants to get out clean in case the raid goes South. Shotgun, team's down. Weiss was team leader. We believe he's been captured. Take that son of a bitch out. The CIA team's under attack. They've got Weiss. You're trembling. I want to be honest, but everything has happened so fast. I promised myself I wouldn't see someone again. - I really need more details. - About me? We don't have more details. Weiss took out the Valta with the grenade, and then he went radio-silent. You've got to move now. I have nothing to hide. Excuse me. Yeah? Sir, we've just had an incident at Alameda yard. How bad? The Valta was destroyed. It was CIA. I double-checked our signal's traffic. Somebody was on your server, in your house, an hour ago. Interesting. Thank you, Pierre. You all right? Your expression -- reminds me of my uncle. Shotgun to Outrigger, Phoenix just gave the call sign. I'm going in. Request backup. I'm on my way. Blow the alarm system. Got it. Outrigger, anything? Negative. Where is she? Where is anyone? The escape tunnel only gave them a 10-minute lead. I know. I know. Okay, I know. They've got to be somewhere. So find them. You're getting very impatient. I'm doing the best I can. You've been doing it for an hour. Well, to trace a guy on a cellular network using the frequency of his phone is like trying to find a needle in a county full of haystacks. You have to find -- Yeah, I know what I'm supposed to be doing, all right? Just shut up! - Sorry about that. - No. That was good. Hey, we got a hit. Found them? Well, the cell phone signal's weak. - Can you locate them? - Yeah, I'm trying. Okay. They were tracking Bishop. We'll coordinate with Vaughn on the ground. I know it must be hard for you... having me at A.P.O. Not at all. I can't defend the choices my mother made. Nadia, I would never blame you for your mother's infidelity. But there is something I need to share with you. I only do this because of your test results. - Did I fail horribly? - Hardly. Not surprisingly, your ability to adapt to sudden changes in protocol, to handle adverse situations is exceptional. The results were very much like your sister's. Sydney doesn't know this yet. The result of an ongoing investigation. Ironically, this intel came in to me just this morning. - This is Sloane. - It's Vaughn. We've got Jack and Nadia. We're tracking Bishop, and we're en route. Let me explain something to you. I have been paid -- handsomely paid -- by the Badenliga to deliver the Valta computer, which you decided to destroy with the toss of a hand grenade. You're welcome. As you can imagine, they won't be very happy. And when they get here, which they will shortly, they'll kill me. Unless I can provide them with information of an equal or greater value. You're both CIA, so you've obviously infiltrated my friends' network. I want to know how. So... what's your real name, Charlene? I'm, uh... "I'm, uh..." what? I'm a-gonna kick your ass. You son of a bitch! The next one goes between your eyes. Now -- Yeah? The Badenliga. If they move, shoot them in the kneecaps. God, my heart! What the hell is going on? You said you weren't agency anymore. I'll tell you later. Thanks for the distraction. Yeah, thanks for saving my life. Wait a minute, this is black ops, isn't it? Huh? Vaughn part of this, too? We got to go. - Am I right? - We got to go. Go for Bishop. Dude, I knew it! I liked you... much better... as Charlene. Is that how you normally deal with bad guys? He was the one. Bishop. He killed our mother. Dad, why does Nadia think that Bishop killed our mother? I adjusted some details in Bishop's file. You set her up. I'd hardly call Martin Bishop an ally. I solved two problems with one answer. You manipulated Nadia. I gave your sister closure. But not the truth.
