we'll give you back your daughter. Sydney Bristow was not to be harmed. You locked her in a train car and you sprayed her with a chemical agent. It's all there... Everything you need to bring Nadia back. We loaded the Bristow D.N.A. template into the sequence. Her genetic fluid is primed and ready. Synchro : Anyone Sixe Guilamu Spécial thanks : Lemonhead Honey, that's not good enough. What am I, a dog whistle? I said no. "N-O." that's right. That's better. Thank you. - Mr. Halbe? - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Hi! - I hope your trip wasn't too arduous. My trip was fine. It's these marketing people. B.A.S, M.B.A.S and not a lick of common sense among 'em! They almost didn't launch my new perfume L'Eau De Passion. They said the name was tacky. Can you believe that?! - It's a lovely name. - I know. That's why I always trust my instincts, and now it is flying off the shelves, flying! I assure you, we can take care of all your customer service needs. I don't want my people suffering through no ten minutes of pan flute to place an order. Of course not. Let me show you our main call center. I think I came to the right place. We just got a lead on Anna. She's routing her calls through a call center in Jaipur; using what? Encrypted router. She must have put something on a line outside. So they have no idea she's piggybacking on their system. She's totally anonymous. So we locate the router and remove the encryption key. Next time Anna makes a call, we listen in. Right, maybe even trace her location. What's the approach? All you need to do is get this perfume bottle within 5 feet of... a Wi-Fi access, point. And then you can just map the phone system. We can figure out which line she's using. - "L'Eau De Passion"? - What, you think it's... too tacky? I'll work with it. Soon, we'll be doubling our call volume capacity. You're gonna need to triple it when you start getting calls about this baby. ...the Mandarin Stripe is on back order,</i> but the Heather Sprig is available. Excuse me, ma'am. How do you like this smell? It's called L'Eau De Passion. Nice. Well, you keep it. Sorry, my computer's working a little slow today. Signal's good. I'm mapping the system now. If you outsource, you can cut your customer service budget by at least 30%. - Interesting. - Syd... We've got a problem. Their router is not out here. It's in the building. Could I come back tomorrow? I need to think about it. No, don't go. Just follow my lead. Nobody move! Drop it! You get on the ground. You in the pink, come here. Get down! Get on the ground! Watches, jewelry, wallets in the bag! Hurry up! No reason not to be nice! Come on! All right now. That's enough for today. Get up. If anyone does anything in the next three minutes, she dies. Let me see this. Hey, I saw a watch I liked. It's probably a Knockoff. Renée, what you did back there... - You don't approve. - No, it was brilliant. You should think about joining A.P.O. In case you forgot, I'm a criminal. We could try for a pardon. You should think about it. I was surprised to hear from you. You made it very clear that your dealings with us were over. I read the instructions. In order for the serum to work, Nadia's heart needs to be stopped. Only briefly, as I recall, 30 seconds or so. You're asking me to kill my daughter. I'm asking you to have faith in Rambaldi. You're saying Rambaldi designed the cure? Well, given that Nadia's illness stems from his invention, doesn't that make sense? Surely, I don't have to convince you of the genius behind his designs. You spent decades pursuing his works. If things had gone differently, you'd be working with us right now. You'd be there. When we realized his greatest achievement. You still could be. My pursuit of Rambaldi is over. I won't allow it to consume me again. I'm only here for Nadia. That's unfortunate, but we upheld our end of the bargain. We gave you the cure. Whether or not you choose to administer it, that's up to you. Anna's line just went active. Marshall and Rachel are standing by to intercept. Initiating the back-trace. Bringing the optical sats online. - Hello? - Did you bring your umbrella?</i> The weather report calls for rain.</i> That's not Anna but Kelly Peyton. - Can you locate them? - Already on it. - Who are you? - That's not important.</i> Anna Espinosa works for me now. That's all you need to know.</i> - I don't do business with strangers. - Check your account.</i> You've already been compensated. I got him. He's in Zurich. 47-22 north, 8-32 east.

Use the protocol you had with Anna</i> to contact me when you unveil the message</i> hidden on the page. Barcelona. That's all we have. I don't know, Anna. He sounds a little skittish. He's the best. If it exists, he'll find it. It doesn't make any sense. If this guy in Zurich was Anna's contact, - why is Peyton the one calling? - It's unclear. But now I want you and Marshall to work together. See if you can I.D. him. If we can bring him into custody, we can use him to get to Anna. Tom, Dixon, reach out to all our contacts in Barcelona. If Prophet Five has established a new outpost there, perhaps someone's heard about it. What about the message? You mean the one buried in a 500-year-old piece of paper? Are we taking that seriously? We've seen too much not to. Look, we still have a copy of page 47. - I could take it and analyze it and... - I'm taking it with me. You have your assignments. If anything develops, notify me at once. Wait, where are you going? Not that you have to tell me, unless you want to. I'm going to see Sloane. He had page 47 in his possession long before it was turned over to the D.S.R. Given his obsession with it, maybe he knows something we don't. I can't just let you lie here like this, not if there's a way to get you back. I'm sorry. God, I'm sorry. It's the only way. Transcript : www.1000fr.com - Move away from her. - You don't understand. - We don't have time. - Stop! This is not your decision to make, - no matter how much she's suffering. - I have to do it now! Oh, my God. It's too late. It was a cure, Jack, A cure. It's okay. It's okay. We're here. So she's working with Prophet Five? Well, that explains how Anna escaped from prison, but why? I mean, why would they want her? - She's good. - Yeah, I know. But Prophet Five has always been low profile. Anna is on everybody's radar. Maybe they had to go to her. Maybe there's only something she can do. We've identified the man from Zurich: Mortiz Koller. He used to be an art historian, was kind of a big shot. Supposedly discovered Da Vinci's lost drawings. Supposedly? He forged them. He was completely discredited. It looks like he went freelance. And plenty of criminal organizations are more than happy to put his talent to good use, including Le Corbeau. - He worked with Renée? - More than once. Well, that means she'll know how to find him. Syd, your father's on line two. Nadia's awake. Looking at her like this, I'm almost afraid to believe it's true. It must be an overwhelming relief. Yeah. I know you have questions, Jack. - Why didn't you tell me? - I wanted to, but I was afraid for people to know. Conventional medicine gave up on my daughter. I couldn't. I've been funding dozens of back-channel research projects, phase-one studies using class "A" drugs, methods that no country would condone. And then one of them paid off... A study out of Barcelona. - Barcelona? - I had no guarantee that it would work. My options had run out. - Sydney. - Is she okay? She's with the doctor now. She's doing wonderfully. You need me for anything, you call the nurse, OK? Hi. Hi. Everything seems normal. I need to run some tests, see if we can determine how... - Nadia's condition reversed itself. - No. My daughter has been poked and prodded enough. If her health is no longer in jeopardy, I want to make arrangements to take her home. She deserves her life back. I understand. I'll update her file now and... see if we can get her out of here as soon as possible. Thank you. You want to go in? In a minute. I have a call to return. Hello? It's me. I need you to look into something, off the record. Sure. What is it? Sloane's recent activities. That is travel itineraries, call logs, meeting reports. Anything you want me to focus on? Barcelona. Did you find Koller? Tom's en route to meet Renée in Paris. But you called me away from Nadia. Sydney, how much do you know about Nadia's cure? - Why? - Sloane's travel records indicate he's made several trips to Barcelona. He was there shortly before we intercepted Peyton's call. Sloane told me he acquired the cure in Barcelona where Prophet Five is based. We know they've used Nadia's condition to blackmail him in the past. Perhaps Sloane's association with them... ...didn't end there. You think he's working with them, that Prophet Five gave him the cure? Perhaps in exchange for information. Sloane's been breaking protocol, incorrectly logging phone calls made from A.P.O. for months, dozens of calls, Syd, all of them made to numbers that no longer exist. He's already admitted to using illegal research channels. Perhaps he's trying to cover it up. Or the back-channel research could be a cover for something else. I know what Sloane is capable of. You don't have to remind me, but Nadia has her life back because of him. Which is why I hope I'm wrong about this. Well, do what you have to do. But until you have something concrete, I'll be with my sister. You cold? Want me to get you a blanket? - No, the air feels good. - Okay. Sydney should be here soon. I can't wait to spend some time with Isabelle. I'm even looking forward to changing diapers in the middle of the night. So you're going to stay at Sydney's? Yeah, I assumed so. Oh my God. Let me see her. Come here, baby. She's dying to meet her aunt Nadia. Yeah, there you... Hi, beautiful. Well, I'll leave the three of you to enjoy each other's company. - Where are you going? - A.P.O. Jack wants to see me. I'll be back. We'll be fine. Won't we? Okay, enjoy the sun. What's happening? Hi. What is it? You wanted to see me? I arranged for the leave of absence you requested. The forms are all here for you to sign. Thank you. Look Jack, I realize the timing on this might be less than ideal, but if you need me... You should be spending this time with Nadia. Well, unfortunately, I'm not sure if she feels the same. Give it time, Arvin. I know. You're right. One last thing. We intercepted a call from Prophet Five. Turns out Anna gave them page 47. They're looking for a hidden message encoded in the text. Were you... ...aware of this? Apparently, the message is hidden in a substitution cipher. Marshall believes he's close to decoding it. I could let you know when we find out. No. No, I think it's better I not be involved. I understand. I talked to Marshall. He'll confirm he's working on page 47 if Sloane goes to him. And the taps are in place? If Sloane alerts Prophet Five, we'll know. Thank you. - Any words from Tom? - He's connected with Renée. They should be making contact with Koller soon. We should get this going. We're following Koller's protocol. It's 10:00. It's 9:59. I didn't realize the French were so punctual. We're not. It's you Americans who are always in a hurry. And we get fat, too. Is there anything else? Now it's 10:00. We're on. We need to meet... Tonight. - How's Isabelle? - She's asleep, finally. I'm all yours. You shouldn't stay up. You must be exhausted. Well, what about you? It's strange. I've already missed so much time. I wish I had been here for you, - with everything that's happened. - I know. And I know what it's like to have a part of your life taken from you. For what it's worth, it gets easier. My father wanted me to stay with him, but I couldn't. Ever since he came into my life, it's always the same. I just don't want to get hurt anymore. I don't blame you. You have every right to be guarded. But... You should know that while you were sick, he was completely devoted to you. I mean, I've never seen him so dedicated to anything. Even Rambaldi? From what I've seen, even Rambaldi. You can stay here as long as you want, as long as you don't mind a crying baby. Are you crazy? I love having so much life around me. It's my dad. - Hey, dad. - Sloane set a meet. - When? - Tonight. I'm going to surveil it. I thought you should know. I'll wait for your call. What is it? There's something you should know. - Nadia. - Sydney told me what you're doing. - I want to go with you. - You sure that's wise? Whatever you're about to find out about my father... I need to know. All right, let's go. Security is armed. Aren't they always? Just try to buy me a couple more minutes. Renée... Almost there. Three, two... - I hate that word. - I'll remember that. You finally got the Ford hybrid. Electric. It comes in handy when you have to be quiet. Regardless of what we find, I believe your father's feelings for you are genuine. I wish that was enough for him. Sloane's not the only family you have, you know. Thank you. What are you doing? We can't see anything from here. All right. What were they saying? I couldn't make it out. We're in. Sloane took something from in here. - Clothes? - Mine. These are my things. He was getting them for you. I don't know what the rest of this is. Findings from clinical trials. Trials for what? Studies from a facility in Barcelona. It appears that I've misjudged your father. Help! Dear God, someone! Anyone! Help! Are you done yet? Please, I don't know what you want from me. We want information about Anna Espinosa. I-I... I can't help you. Yes, you can. We know she hired you to decode a message in this. I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about. Anna who? I know you're trying to do right by your client. But you and I both know you are not cut out to withstand extended interrogation. You're just some unlucky bookworm who's in way over his head. Please, don't hurt me! Then stop screaming and talk! I have a meet set with Anna tomorrow... in Ghana. She knows what the message was? No. I want to get paid. Why wouldn't she pay you? Anna doesn't like bad news. The document... it's a fake. Very well done, but... but a fake. And you believe him? He has no reason to lie. He found a small amount of titanium dioxide in the pigment. Well, that means the document can't be older than 80 years. Give or take a decade. - How do you want to proceed? - We keep the meet. We can still use Moritz and the counterfeit page - to bait Anna. - Guess I'll see you in Ghana. And the real one-- where is it? - Nadia... - I'm sorry. I should have called. No, of course not. I... I thought you were staying at Sydney's. Sydney went to Ghana. They're going after Anna. That's not the reason I'm here. I was hoping I could stay with you. Maybe we can take some time, get to know each other again, if it's okay. How could you even ask that? Come in, sweetheart. This is my favorite sweater. I remembered. Thank you. Chamomile. You remembered that, too. I need to admit something to you. I didn't think you'd want to be with me at all. Especially not after what my actions caused for you. I've been quite angry. Well, you have every right to be angry. Nadia, when I first met you, I didn't know how to be a father. I assumed it meant being needed. And then I saw you lying in the hospital in that bed, and I realized something. I realized that I need you more than you will ever need me. I'm sorry. I... I promised myself I wouldn't put any pressure on you. It's no pressure. Dinner's almost ready. - You need some help? - No. Let me explain. Nadia, you're going to have to trust me. You said it was over. - No, it's not what it looks like. - You've been lying all along. Look, I handed everything over to the D.S.R. except for that page. I couldn't part with it. I-I'd spent so much time... I don't want more excuses. Just talking about Rambaldi, your face, your voice-- it all changes. - This obsession you have-- - No, it's not an obsession. It's faith. Do you have any idea what your faith cost me? What did you think, that I was sleeping peacefully? The last 12 months were an extended nap? I heard people talking. I felt tubes being shoved down my throat. I couldn't open my eyes. I couldn't move. I couldn't scream. But I felt everything, so forgive me if I don't have much tolerance for your faith. Nadia, please! You have to understand-- I'm done trying to understand you! You have to make a choice. Either me or this. Please, don't make me choose between the two most important things in my life. I suppose then you'll lose us both. My god, the message! - I see it. - You're not getting it! - Get out of my way! - No, you can't have it! I won't let you! Stop, please! - Stop it! - Nadia, move! Okay, now this place-- crazy crowded. I'm not talking about mall crowded, I'm saying like people, cars, goats. That's why Anna chose it-- hard to surveil. What's the plan? How are we apprehending her? Visual aids here. Courtesy of Mitchell. Okay, uh, well, we have Anna, who will be arriving on the main road right here. Now, uh, let's see. Dixon and Rachel will be stationed right here. - Are the exits secured? - Yeah. Tom will be cutting off the back, and... Sydney will... sorry, Syd... will be at the entrance. - So here comes Anna-- - Okay, thank you. Notify me when they have her in custody. Well, I wasn't done with the-- - It's fine. Thank you. - The car was... I get it. Everybody's getting set up. When you see Anna, you'll take her out with this. Government issue. I never thought I'd have one of these. Don't get too excited. It's only a tranq gun. That's too bad. Have you give any more thought to my offer about A.P.O.? Yeah, I work better on my own schedule. When are you going to start trusting me? I trust you. It's everyone else that's the problem. Okay, go. Beautiful jewelry for a beautiful lady. No cash, sorry. I'm a starving student. Is everything all right? Wonderful, considering I might get killed today. Relax. We've got you covered. This will be fine. Thank you. Target approaching. Copy. Copy that. What's going on? She's not getting out. Something's not right. Hold your positions. They're retreating. I've lost visual. Don't let her escape! Repeat, Anna's car is headed toward the entrance! - Rachel, follow the car. - Copy that. Renée, block off the back alleys. She knows it's an ambush! Someone tipped her off. She's not here. Repeat-- - Anna is not in the car. - Copy. She must have gotten out. Let's search the perimeter. A few days ago, I was absolutely horrified</i> that you would suggest I would turn against A.P.O.,</i> that I would kill my own daughter. I realize now that both were inevitable, that death is a necessary sacrifice, necessary to complete the final leg of this journey.</i> I have been preparing for this my whole life.</i> I knew it was coming. I have betrayed everyone I ever loved, but I was chosen... We appreciate what you've done. And this is my road to follow.
