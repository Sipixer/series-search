They worked together for seven years. - Sydney's contact is Renée Rienne. - Really? Ms. Rienne has been helping Sydney with her investigation of the Prophet Five conspiracy. Michael always told me I could come to you. Yeah. These people killed my fiancé, the father of my child. Our agreement is whatever I say it is. I'm the one who got you out of prison. I can easily put you back. How's your daughter? Nadia has nothing to do with this. Oh, sure, she does. I'm at the archive. Your turn now. Got the key. It's transmitting now. Insert key template. Perfect. I'm entering the archive. I need the lock number. So what are we looking for? All I know is it's intended for Gordon Dean. The intel I received said it will be left for him at the University of Rome inside a package shipped to their museum archive. Well, how will we know which package? It will be sent from Milan, from an alias... Marcello Demasi. I found the alias. Can you give me a minute to find the name? Here it is. Marcello Demasi. Num... Sydney? Sydney Bristow? I don't believe it. Professor Choi. Sydney, I need the lock number. Look at you. You look great. Thank you. Sydney. What are you doing in Rome? Sabbatical. I'm teaching classes and doing some research. And what about you? Oh, I've just been traveling... 12 countries in 22 months. Got it. 1222. I know that's a lot, but I won't have much of a chance after the baby's born. Now get out of there before the Chancellor gets back. Well, I should let you get back to your class. No problem. I'm on a lunch break. We have plenty of time. Great. You know, uh, I don't wanna be presumptive, but, uh, you married? Newlyweds. Ah, eager to start a family then? I guess you could say we dove right in. Well, he must be some guy. You seem really happy. He is. I found the shipment. I'm retrieving the package. I'll take that. Put it down. Step back. Got it. I'm on my way to the extraction point. So is he here with you, your husband? He's at the hotel. I'd love for you to meet him. We'll take you to dinner, if you'll just write down your number. Sure, I would like that. Here, take my card. It was inside the sculpture. Any idea what it's for? No. So who was that man? - Choi? - No one. He was from another life. She's still unresponsive. There's been no change since yesterday. I'm afraid the xylenol didn't work. The drug is still in the experimental age. It deserves more time. Mr. Sloane, we've kept Nadia in a medically induced coma for five months now. None of our procedures have shown any promise. When we bring her out, she displays the same violent propensities. Now these treatments are extremely costly. Expense is not an issue. We've simply run out of options. At this point, anything that we may try is unlikely to inspire change. It may even do more harm than good. I am not prepared to give up. Neither are we. In the meantime, I think you should consider alternative care in a place a little more comfortable. Okay, thank you, Doctor. Yes? How is she doing today? I feel for you. I can't imagine how hard it must be looking into the face of your own sins. What do you want, Dean? Sydney Bristow has taken something of mine... an access card. I want you to get it back. Why? What is it for? That's none of your concern. 48 hours. Don't let me down. Are you sure this is the right move? The right move? If they find out what you're up to... They won't. Besides, I don't think I have the choice at this point. You're being paranoid again. You're too important to this operation to be dismissed over a few setbacks. Well, maybe you're right, but some life insurance will help me sleep better at night. You too, I imagine. Odds are if they terminate me, they'll decide our entire cell is a security risk. I'll let you know when Sloane contacts me. Hello, Jack. Arvin, good news. Sydney's mission in Italy was a success. Yes, I already knew that. Did you? How? Gordon Dean told me. Translation : Anyone Sixe Guilamu Transcript : Raceman Synchro : Guilamu Suggestions critics insults : aliassub@gmail.com Marshall ran analysis on the card you retrieved? He suspects it's an access key for a secure network. So we just have to figure out which network. Luckily, there are only 10 billion secure networks in the world. We may have a dead end on that side, but we intercepted Dean's property. I'm guessing he's not too happy about that, so... I'll take what I can get. - Delivery for Sydney Bristow. - Hey, come on in. Just put it in the nursery. It's right through there. Thanks. Crib. You know, the, uh, the nursery could use a little work. I don't know. I think it's kind of airy. I'll grab my bag. We can head in to work. I thought you were taking the day off. I was. That was before we had ten billion secure networks to analyze. I have a better idea. First, let's set up the crib, and then at least that way, we'll know we got something accomplished today. It's okay. I'll do it later. What could it take, half an hour? I used to think that stuff would be so fun... decorating a room and picking out colors. It hasn't turned out exactly the way I thought it would. Yeah? I was first contacted a month ago. It was during my sentencing hearings. As I told your father, the terms were simple. They offered to sway the committee's decision for my release... and I, in turn, would be indebted to them. It was not made clear what that would entail, but I had an idea. You've been lying to us this whole time. There's no justification. However, faced with spending the rest of my life in prison while my daughter was in the hospital, I... Nadia hasn't made any improvement. Why admit this to us now? What's changed? Nadia won't be getting better, Jack. If I have to face a life without my daughter... I still have to live with myself. It sounds hollow, I know, in light of what I just told you... but I consider you both to be my family. You expect us to forgive you now? No, Sydney, not at all. I know how much pain Dean has caused you as well as Rachel Gibson. I have damaged your investigation enough. Ironically, Dean's arrangement puts me in a unique position. The last thing he expects of me is to double cross him. You'll help us arrest him? Yes. He's tasked me with recovering something you took from him... an access card. I can use that as bait. Understand something. If this is a setup... It's not, Sydney, I assure you. Once we have Dean in custody, he will be forced to expose his organization, and you will have all the answers you're looking for. You have a way to contact Dean? Hello? It's me. I have what you wanted. Good. I knew I could count on you. Where should we meet? Get a pen. Write this down. The meeting place is a racetrack. Dean may trust Sloane, but he's still being cautious. He picked this location because it's safe... several exit strategies, a large crowd to blend in with. That or maybe he's got Lollipop in the second. We'll have to grab him before he has the chance to slip out. That won't be easy. Dean doesn't go anywhere without a security detail. It'll most likely be two men heavily armed, nearly invisible. We can assume that one will shadow Dean, the other Sloane. Um, sorry. Is anybody else having déja vu here? I mean, first Sloane was good, then he's bad, now he's good again? Although I guess he was bad at first, I just thought... We have a significant tactical disadvantage. Dean knows what we look like. He can I.D. every one of us. Not everyone. He's never seen me... but I look forward to making his acquaintance. Good. Tom, you'll take lead. Dixon, Sydney, Rachel, you'll provide support in the field. I want a plan drafted within the hour. Wheels up at 1500. We may not have another chance like this. Let's make it count. Dean's reserved you a seat in the grandstand. He won't arrive until he's confirmed you're alone. If we put a transmitter on you, his security countermeasures may detect it, so I'll be tracking you remotely. You'll need this. It's a facsimile, I assume. No, it's the real card. Dean may verify it with a reader. We'll move in as soon as we've intercepted his men, but until then, you'll have to stall. Okay. I hacked into the closed-circuit feeds. We're ready to go. Okay, you're up. Look, Sydney... I may have lost the opportunity to save my own child. I only hope that by taking out Dean, I will have helped to save yours. Good luck. Okay. Dixon and Tom are in position. No sign of Dean yet. He won't reveal himself until Sloane is in place. Excuse me. Mama comin' through! Watch out. Don't jostle the package! How y'all doin'? How y'all doin'? You gonna help me pick a winner today, skinny? Ha ha. He's cute... for a Sheik. Excuse me that's my seat. Okay, laser mic's on target, Phoenix. Reception's good. Hey, Base. You got a visual? Affirmative, Sidewinder. Good, 'cause, uh, I was wondering, what do you think of this suit? Pretty sweet, huh? Yeah, it's a nice suit on you. Blue's a good color. And for you as well, Director Bristow. Thanks. Oracle, can you get us a closer look at Sloane? - How's that? - Fine. I got him. The package has arrived. East concourse. There. Sloane's in position. Sidewinder, we're headed your way. Ten four. Let's do this. We've got you. Sidewinder, you're up. How ya doin', mate? Well, I'm fantastic. Thanks for asking. You know why? The Tasmanian Devil is straight as a string. Gonna make me a rich man. The thing is, I'm short 2 grand. What do you say you front me, and I double it for you by dark? - Not today. - Come on, mate. That watch alone would get me 2 grand across the card. We need an assist here. This way. First security detail down. The second one hasn't shown. But this guy's wearing an earpiece. Which means Dean's communicating with him via radio. He could be anywhere. Outrigger, until we I.D. the second detail, we'll have to proceed with the meet. Copy that. You search crowd. Someone you know? Yes, I do. Lovely day. Yes, it is. Outrigger, if Dean's following his standard protocol, that second detail shouldn't be any more than 50 feet away. Do you have something for me? I do. Outrigger, I've got him at 12:00. Blue cap, binoculars. I'm on it. Excuse me, Sir. I believe you have my seat. Drinks too much. Filthy habit. Second security detail is down. Good work. Outrigger and Sidewinder, move in. It's been a pleasure. Post one, what's your status? Outrigger, Sidewinder, move in. Post two, what's your status? Oracle, I've lost sight of him. Post two, do you copy? Sidewinder, come in! Outrigger, do you copy? Their P.A. System must be bleeding into our channel. I'll try to find an open frequency. Oracle, do you copy me? I've lost... - Outrigger? Phoenix? - Come in! We've got a problem! Stand up. What? We're gonna take a walk. Do it now. Base? Anyone? Phoenix! Damn it. You don't need to do this. I'm telling you, I came here by myself. Just keep going. Stop. Well, isn't this a surprise? What are you doing here, Rachel? You gonna fight me? Why do you think we never put you in the field? Because we knew you weren't equipped. Well, then... that was your loss. Oracle, come in. Do you have a visual? Yeah, actually on... on Dean. - What's he doing? - Eating dirt. I just hit him with a shovel. A shovel? Is he conscious? Yeah, I think so. Then hit him again. - We got Dean. - That's good. What happens now? He tells us everything. And we get the truth about Prophet Five. You seem very pleased with yourself. I'll keep this simple. We have a few questions for you. We want to know who you're working for and what their agenda is. The only other question is whether you'll cooperate willingly or unwillingly. The ironic thing is, Ms. Bristow, you and I may not share the same agenda, but we have the same goal. I want to know who I'm working for as much as you do. Unfortunately, for both of us, you robbed me of that opportunity. The access card. You were making a power play. The people I answer to... their power stems from remaining anonymous. I was hoping to balance the playing field. All the information you want can be accessed off a communication hub using that card. But before I tell you the location, you have to agree to do something for me. And what is that? I want $10 million, as well as documents to authenticate half a dozen false identities and dental implants capable of fooling facial-recognition software. In short, you're going to make me disappear. - Not a chance. - I wouldn't be so hasty. That access card will expire in just under 12 hours, at which point the information will vanish and I can no longer help you, so... I suggest you talk to the people you answer to and share with them my offer. I don't need to. I don't think it's gonna take that long. - What is it? - L.S.D. Well, sort of. See, I started with a lysergic acid diethylamide-based serum and, you know... flinkmanized it. Of course, he's not gonna see any dancing bears on this trip, I promise you that. Not that... I mean, I heard about it from a guy once. I've never... Hey, Mr. Bristow. How long until we can interrogate Dean? Not long. In about an hour, he'll think you're God. He'll tell you anything you wanna know. Of course, if you'd like, I could facilitate the process. Let's do that. I see you've done this before. - Peaceful, hmm? - Yeah, it is. I imagine you're having quite a difficult day. Am I right? Excuse me, do I know you? Nope, you don't know me, Mr. Sloane. But I do have one small favor to ask of you. My associates and I are aware of your adventure in Dubai. We also know that Gordon Dean is still in custody, presumably at A.P.O. We need you to eliminate him. Eliminate him? Yes, and we have every confidence that you'll be able to overcome any obstacles that stand in your way. I see. You can go to hell. I've already confessed my bargain with Mr. Dean, you people no longer have any power over me. That may be. But we do still have plenty to offer. I doubt there's anything that you could do for me. Uh, you should answer that. Yeah? My God. What did you do? Nothing. It just happened. The nurse came through on rounds 15 minutes ago and found her awake. Dad? I'm right here, sweetheart. I'm right here. Where am I? You're gonna be okay, Nadia. You're gonna be okay. Well, his brain waves are all over the place, which I guess explains why his heart rate's off the chart. Maybe Twisted Sister wasn't the way to go. - Cut it. - Right. You know, I think I gave him too much diophorazide. My bad. I mean, he is hallucinating hard. Whatever he's seeing, it's scaring him to death, literally. We have to stabilize his vitals. He won't talk otherwise. Well, no, I don't think his body can withstand any more drugs. Then what do we do? Well, not that I would know or anything, but... well, he needs to feel safe. I mean, maybe if somebody comforted him... You! I'm not gonna hurt you. I know you're scared. Just relax. They want me dead. They'll kill me. Well, that won't happen. I won't let it. I'm taking care of you now. Okay, his heart rate is coming down. It's working! I'm gonna ask you some questions. When you answer me, I'll make sure no one can hurt you. Okay? No one. Do you understand? They want my eyes. Don't let them take my eyes. No, I won't. No one can hurt you as long as I'm here. No one. Listen, the access card... it was designed to patch into a specific network. Tell me which one. Which network does the card access? I can help you. When you see the watchman, you'll need me. I can help you. Listen to me, you need to focus. How do I get into your organization's network? Get away from me! It's your fault! I needed to find the secret. I needed protection! I'm protecting you now. Tell me the secret. I'll keep it safe. Stay with me, Gordon. The watchman is on the roof. You need to go... to the roof. Okay, which roof? Where do I find it? Glenheim. Okay, what is Glenheim? Okay, there's a Glenheim corporation in Seattle. The Glenheim Towers. Pull up the building schematics. I'll pull up the building schematics. Okay, there's a satellite on the roof connected to the network of servers. Rachel, we need a plane fueled and ready to leave for Seattle within the hour. Hello. When? I shouldn't have done it. I didn't mean to. They insisted. You didn't want to do what? They insisted to kill Michael Vaughn. I can help you defeat them, but you have to hurry. They have plans for you. What plans? Sydney, you need to go. I'll take over from here. It's Nadia. You've never looked more beautiful, Nadia. Sovogda? What happened? I'll tell you about it in time. Just rest for now. - Dad? - I listen. Where's the doctor? Just stepped out for a minute. What's happening? Oh, God. Please, I need help here! Please! Help! I need help here! Doctor! I need you to step back, Mr. Sloane. Nadia! Please! Blood pressure 70 over 50. I need 500 milligrams of detropine I.V. We were forced to induce coma again. Look, I'll be honest. Waking up without any signs of her disease was, frankly, a fluke. Without an explanation, it's likely this is never gonna happen again. Of course, we'll watch her closely. Thank you, doctor. You've done everything you can for her. Beyond that, it's out of your control. Thank you, Sydney. This is Outrigger. We've touched down. Copy that. I heard. Are you okay? Yeah. - How's Sloane? - Not well. We figured out what Dean was talking about. The network his organization's using is mobile. Meaning? Their communications are piggy-backed through a series of telecom satellites. The Glenheim people don't know they're being used, which is exactly the point. They wouldn't know the network was there unless they were looking for it. Further, the network is rerouted every few days as a precautionary measure. If we lose them now, we won't find them again. How much time do we have? 12 minutes, 58 seconds. Sidewinder, what's your status? We're at the dish. We're cutting through now. When you open up the panel, let me know what you're looking at. I'm looking at a keypad and an L.C.D. readout. Okay, um, any access ports? Affirmative. Uplink should be coming your way. Got it. - Marshall, what are we looking at? - I'm not sure. It looks like the network's not tracking back to just one source. Meaning? Meaning when I try to locate the origin, several addresses keep popping up. It looks like the information's being fed by a number... wait a minute, that is weird. One of the nodes streams to Credit Marquis. - What's that? - Public front for French intelligence. That's not all. I mean, there's a stream to the Russian S.V.R., a European pharmaceutical conglomerate, the C.D.C., MI-6, this list goes on. So they're hijacking government servers? No, if that were the case, I'd be able to detect it. I mean, this suggests... they are government. Dad? Gordon Dean didn't bribe someone on the inside to get Sloane out of jail. His organization is already on the inside. Marshall, can you trace those nodes? Yeah, let me see what I can do. Right on time. Network diagnostic is up and running. You got two minutes to grab that coffee. Oh, and get me a cup, too? Little cream. Arvin. For the next minute and a half, no one knows I'm here. Good. Get me out of these. That isn't exactly what I had in mind. Okay, I've narrowed the network down to 12 isolated nodes. I think I can trace their point of origin. - 12? - Yeah. "If there was never a one, there was ever the 12." In the Caymans, that was one of Dean's account protocols. What just happened? We're locked out. Let me try to bypass the encryption. - Oh, no. - What is it? "Grade three watchman encryption." There's no way around this in six minutes. The program's requesting an access code. Dean mentioned "watchman." He said when I find the watchman, he would help me. This is what he meant. He has the access code. Go. Don't do this, Arvin. I have the access code. You can take down Prophet Five. God forgive me. Help! Somebody, please! These walls are soundproof. There's no point in shouting. According to medical services, Dean took his own life. Apparently with a cyanide pill he had subdermally implanted inside his cheek. I don't understand. This morning he wanted immunity. He wanted to live. Clearly, Dean thrived on power. Once the drug wore off, he must've realized he was facing a life sentence. Death was easier to accept. Marshall counted 12 sources that make up Prophet Five. 12, dad. It's like the Alliance all over again. I know. If they are embedded inside global government, where do we even start? We've already started. I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Do you have any plans for tonight? What did you have in mind? You're sure you won't join me? We can drink to your success. Or perhaps, if you like, to soothe your guilt. Guilt isn't one of my driving emotions. To your success then. As we agreed, Dean's operation is now yours. But with one warning... I appreciate ambition. But if you're considering any further betrayals, they will come at your own expense. I understand. I'll be right back. A job well done, Mr. Sloane. I'm so glad you took our offer. I didn't have much of a choice, did I? - There's always a choice. - Yeah. My daughter... when will she be cured? - Soon. - Soon? Perhaps you could be a bit more specific. I wish I could. But there are a few more things we need you to do first. - We have a deal. - No. We have an arrangement, which you don't seem to understand very well. You son of a bitch. We'll be in touch. Till then, I want you to remember one thing... you have something now that you didn't have this morning. - What's that? - Hope. - Okay, that's the headboard. - That's the footboard. That's what I said. Have you ever actually built anything before? Yes, in fact. I built your crib. Really? Well, your mother and I did it together. Done. Done? Why? Did you doubt me? No, of course not. Get me the screwdriver. Translation : Anyone Sixe Guilamu
