I won't let anyone else take the final steps for me. Listen to me, you son of a bitch. You have been a plague on my life. You repulse me. Every time I sat listening to your lies, all I could do was fantasise about slashing your throat. Drop it! Why are you wearing that ring? Since that night... You've been missing for almost two years. There was a fire at your apartment. Will survived, but you... They found remains. The DNA was a match. You were dead. You were dead. And you got married. I did. They asked me to come to Hong Kong. The agency thought it would be best if you were reintroduced by someone from your life before. They could have sent my father. He's CIA. He's from my life before. I can't answer that. I chose not to stay with the CIA after your death. You're not with the agency? No. I'm a teacher. This is gonna take me awhile. They want me to bring you back. You can imagine what kind of investigation's being called. Hell of a way to wake up. How much time do I have before I have to go? They said they want you back as... I don't know who the hell you are, but you are not Vaughn! Tell me who you're working for! Is it Sloane? Tell me you're working for Sloane! Don't... Don't... You're safe. You're at the Stafford Naval Hospital. You're home again. Sydney, there are no words to make this easy. It was Vaughn who came for you in Hong Kong. And what he told you was the truth. Dixon, what happened to me? We don't know. Where's my father? Or my mom? Have you heard from her since Mexico City? Vaughn said Will's alive. If there was a fire in my apartment, if he thought I was dead, how did Will survive? And where is he? And Francie, is she dead? - Did they find her body? - You have a million questions. I have more than a million questions. I wish I only had a million questions! - Be patient. - I can't be patient. I woke up like it was one night. I have a scar on my stomach I have never seen. Two years have passed, and I need to be patient? I deserve to know what happened to the people in my life! Where the hell is Kendall? Kendall is not the director of our division anymore. I am. Almost six months now. Congratulations. How you feeling? I'm okay. You look great. You lost weight. Oh, thanks. Yeah. I gave up all the foods I enjoy. I'm miserable, but I look really good. We got something. I need just a minute. Excuse me. - I'm sorry to be all cryptic. - It's okay. I get it. We received a transmission from Mr. Kingsley. He got the package and the decoy. He's on schedule, aboard a train to Avignon. We received intel The Covenant may be moving to intercept Kingsley and get the chip. - And we can't reach Kingsley? - No, he's radio silent. But we have a lead, an address outside of Paris, a possible outpost for The Covenant. Contact the SNCF. Have them stop the train at the next station and recheck Kingsley's ticket. He'll know to make contact. And get a team in prep. I want to raid this outpost. I have to get back. Dixon, I want to see my dad. What is the big deal? Your father's in prison. National Security Council has had him in solitary for almost a year. Their policy, without exception, is that he is to have no visitors. Mr. Kingsley, you know what I want. Give it to me, and I make your death painless. One more time. My shoe. My left shoe. Not what I wanted. What? You okay? I think I know. Oh, my God. I think I know where I was. There are so many new people. I don't know anyone here. Just give it time. Excuse me. Excuse me, hello? Hi. Sydney, I'm Marshall Flinkman. I work here. Tech Design and Operation here. Marshall, of course I know who you are. Oh, thank God. Sydney, it is so amazing to see you. I can't even really... Actually, I wrote a poem. "I've lost my keys. Where are they?" - Sydney. - Carrie. Welcome back. - You're pregnant. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. I am. I wonder who the father is. - Are you guys married, too? - No. We're not married. We're not even engaged. But we're talking about getting married. Not really. She just has an issue with wedlock. Syd, Dixon's expecting us. If you need anything, just ask. "I've lost my keys. Where are they?" That's a metaphor. We'd like to hear about what happened last night. I had a memory, a vivid memory of the interior of the building where I was being held. I know that it was in Paris, and I remember the faces of at least three of my captors. Mr. Weiss' report says you recall overhearing voices, names, including Mr. Kingsley? This is Robert Lindsey. He's our NSC liaison. Yes. So far that's all I remember. It sounds like the group we're looking for is the one that was holding our girl. Last night there was a mass murder on a passenger train. Among the dead was a CIA asset, Scott Kingsley. Kingsley did work for us. He designed an aircraft, a spy drone, that could fly undetected by radar. Kingsley was en route to Avignon to deliver the schematics. They were stolen. This drone can be converted into a delivery system. Biological weapons, chemical. I get it. This group. We know almost nothing about them. They refer to themselves as "The Covenant." We have some intelligence identifying one of their outposts. We believe this is where they've taken the chip. We're sending a team to Paris to raid the building. Look familiar? Yes. See, we're going in with or without you. Without you, we're blind. You might recognise details we wouldn't see otherwise. I'm personally of the mind that sending you into the field so soon after your recovery is asinine. Well, you might ask yourself how much you want to apprehend these killers. Do not question my resolve. What you are suggesting is premature. Listen to what I'm suggesting. I've experienced trauma myself. Return to the field prematurely. It's as dangerous as not being trained at all. Excuse me. I'm standing right here. I think I might be helpful in Paris. But I will not even consider going unless you help me first. I want to see my father right now. Miss Bristow, just so we're clear, I have no intention of doing your father one single favour. Ever. That said, it's not your fault he's your father. And I'm not without a heart, as you will come to see. I'll get you in this one time. Thanks. Sweetheart, you look so beautiful. They told me you were charged with resisting authority. Yes. Dad, I don't understand. I became obsessed with your death, with finding those responsible. And at a certain point in my pursuit, I needed help. So I contacted the one person I believed I could trust, given the circumstances. Your mother. You were working with mom? At the time, she was number six on the CIA's Most Wanted list. The National Security Council, primarily Robert Lindsey... - Have you met him? - Yes. He discovered I was collaborating with your mother, so he threatened me. Questioned my allegiance to this country. He chose to make an example of me. An NSC power play. Here we are. I was told you have a memory. That you believe you were being held in Paris. It's an anti-eavesdrop device. I got it from Marshall. We have 90 seconds. Dad, I don't remember a thing. I read Dixon's lips when he was outside my hospital room. I made it up to get leverage, and they want me on a mission. - Leverage for what? - To see you. They told me I couldn't see you, and I needed to. I don't know if I can explain what it's like waking up and having everything be different. My friends are gone. I have no job, no home, and Vaughn's married. - You're in prison, and... - Vaughn's what? He got married. Michael Vaughn is just a boy who was never good enough for you anyway. Sydney, listen to me. My investigation into your death became more disturbing than I expected. You must continue my work and find what happened to you. - Do you understand me? - Yes. The only way is by getting your CIA clearance restored, having access to my files, getting out in the field. I don't think I can do this without you. We both know that's not true, and you have no choice anyway. The CIA, I am certain, is dubious about your return. You must get them to trust you again. If they learn you are bluffing about your memory, it's over. Dad, what did you mean, the investigation was disturbing? Sydney, I knew you were alive. I made a discovery that you need... You probably know this, but I love you. I love you, too. The object of tonight's mission is to find and retrieve the microchip. Also, to acquire any intel about The Covenant, who we believe is in possession of this chip. We've had the building under surveillance. It appears to be abandoned, but no guarantees. You've all met Agent Bristow. She was held prisoner in this building. So while I will be leading the operation, we will take into consideration any warnings and insights that Agent Bristow has to offer. Any questions? Let's go. Hey, you alright? Yeah. Move, move, move! Base, we're in position. Any last-minute fun? We've got no activity outside the building, and thermal imaging shows the interior to be clean. - Good to hear. - Anything from Mountaineer? Hey, any of this look familiar? Not yet. - Negative. - Roger that. Retriever, move on your call. Okay, let's keep an eye out for tripwires. Watch your back. Let's move. Alpha team, no sign of hostiles in quadrant two. Heading east down quadrant six corridor. Hallway clear. Heading towards quadrant three. Alpha team, hallway clear. Building appears to be abandoned. Hey, you remember this? - Base to retriever. - Go, base. We're picking up some company. Quadrant 16, heading 2.00. Retriever to team, be alert for a possible hostile. Quadrant 16 headed toward quadrant 9. Retriever, we're seeing activity. I'm counting three, now five additionals. We have five potential hostiles. Let's get ready to engage. Base, we're under attack. We're under attack! Fall back now! - Fall back now! - Go, go, go! There are two more of them. Quadrant six. All agents abort. Fall back now. Let's split up and take them from behind. Okay. Go! Come on, Morris. Stay with me. Come on. - Are you okay? - Yeah, go get him. They're dead. All of them. Oh, my God, Weiss. If I told the truth, this might not have happened. What are you talking about? I've never been here before. The dream I had... I just... I needed to regain the CIA's trust. And now the team's dead. Syd, this operation was on whether you came or not. And if you hadn't, I'd be dead, too. I don't know what to do. I... Everything's wrong. Everything is upside down. - We got to get home. - I can't go back! Robert Lindsey hates my father. He doesn't trust me. He wanted results from this. He wanted the chip. If I go back, he'll pull my clearance. I'll never be able to help my father. What are you thinking? This was obviously an ambush. Those gunmen work for The Covenant. The one who was gonna kill you, I saw his face. If I can make a positive I.D., that could lead to the chip. - Leverage. - To do what? To get my father out of custody. To recover what was stolen from the CIA. To make sure these men didn't die for nothing. I'm gonna need a contact. A freelancer, not with the CIA. Someone with resources. All my names are two years old. You're not gonna like my suggestion. You should go see Arvin Sloane. What? Sloane negotiated a pardon after your death. He's now a consultant for the CIA. Yeah, he now runs a world health organisation in Zurich. Omnifam. Listen to me. We never had this conversation. After the gunfight, I disappeared. - You never saw me again. - So what are you gonna do? Excuse me. Miss? Miss, you can't go in there! It's okay. We're fine. Hello, Sydney. There's a group the CIA has targeted. They call themselves The Covenant. They've stolen something I need to get back. I've made a visual I.D. of one of their members. I need to put a name to his face. You're gonna help me find him. You must be in real trouble to come to me for assistance. His name is Gordei Volkov. He's a former Russian MVD, a high-class hit man. You just happen to have his file sitting on your desk? I had it ready because I was expecting you. Sydney, I know you've gone rogue and that your father is being held in solitary. And based on my experience with you, I would say you're looking for a way to win his freedom. Am I right? Sydney, just try and remember the bond that we had between us, you and I. I loved you like a daughter. I loved you. And even you would admit there were times... I would see it in your eyes. You looked at me like I was your... Where have I been the last two years? I know it was you! What did you do to me? - Do you believe in redemption? - Not for you, no. We've helped to feed over 3 1/2 million children worldwide. We do research. Our work on cancer has the potential to save millions of lives, Sydney. So much has changed since you've been gone. Remember the Rambaldi device? A machine designed 500 years ago by a prophet. All I did was bring the pieces together and have it assembled. And when I turned it on, it delivered a message, as I suspected it would. I wasn't prepared for what it said. The message was just one word, one simple word. "Peace." The epiphany I had at that moment... Suddenly I saw all the mistakes I made, the pain that I had inflicted on the world, the people I loved. So I chose right then and there to give information to the CIA, with which they were able to dismantle over two dozen terrorist cells. I don't know how you convinced the CIA that you're trustworthy. Why don't you check my files? I know you too well. I don't buy any of it. I tried to reach over two dozen contacts. You're the only one still active. Thank you for coming. Of course. Forgive me if I look shocking to you, but I was believing you were dead. I was, but now I'm not. This is why I love our business. I need some information. I hope I can help you. Gordei Volkov. I just got a call from the D.O.J. You had Sydney Bristow listed as an enemy of the state? Mr. Dixon, your operative ran. Sydney Bristow is a fugitive. This is why I did not want to send her out. Given her condition, we should be helping her. I hate to pull rank, but the Department of Justice is my jurisdiction, blindly trusting Sydney... I never suggested we blindly trust anyone, but classifying her in this way makes her a target. Then make a suggestion. I suggest that we use our resources to locate her. Oh, she'll be located. I want her back in this office alive. Volkov has a meeting scheduled for tomorrow night in Prague. I have the address. He's supposed to be delivering something. What it is, I do not know. Perhaps it is your thing. Do you know what he drives? A sedan, armoured, of course, with a protective detail. Sydney, if you want to stop that car, you will need backup. No, I don't. But I will need clothes. I have the plans for the drone. If you want them back, get the NSC to release my father immediately. Excuse me. I won't be blackmailed by a fugitive. Did you really think you could come in here and threaten me? - Yeah. - What the hell are you doing? I want it in writing that today Jack Bristow is to be released. Mr. Dixon, talk to her. I'm addressing you, Mr. Lindsey. I want that "get out of gaol free" card for my father, or these are gone. This is ridiculous. Mr. Dixon, please provide Mr. Lindsey with a pen. I got my own pen, and there's not a chance I'm using it. It's your call. 5... - This is insane. - 4... Mr. Lindsey, she will destroy those plans. 3...2... 1. Fine. Thank you. B-R-l-S-T-O-W. I know how to spell your name. I came by to see how you were. Are you kidding me? No, I just wanted to make sure you're... You didn't come here to see how I am. You came to see how you are, because you know what you did. You want to make sure you're okay. I buried you. Consider that for one second... Don't use rational thought as a defence with me, not after all you and I have seen. Vaughn, you and I live and breathe madness every day on the job. There is no rational thought. I can't pretend to have a conversation about anything else with you. What it comes down to is faith. What I was hoping you would say is, "I gave up on us. I lost faith." But what you came here for was closure, and there is not a chance you are getting that from me. I'm not gonna say I understand. I'm not gonna sympathise with you and tell you how hard it must be for you. But you want to know how I am? I am horrible. Vaughn, I am ripped apart. And not because I lost you, but because if it had been me, I would have waited. I would have found the truth. I wouldn't have given up on you. And now I realise what an absolute waste that would have been. Thank you. There's something I need to show you. Not here. Almost a year after your apparent death, I was on an operation. One of the men I was tracking was this man, Andrian Lazarey. Russian diplomat. I've never seen him before. This was from a hidden camera that I placed. This is how I knew you were alive. You don't recall that man
