For you it's very... okay. For me, too. I am sorry for barging in to you. Is no problem. Do you travel much ? Yes. For my work. I like the train. Yes. What is your work ? I'm in chemical business. I knew something like that. - You did ? - Yes. Because I look at your hands when I come in and I think, he uses brain more than hands. I use hands also. I am hoping so. So what is in case ? Chemical ? - Chemical, yes. - No. Yes. Something danger. - In this, danger ? - Yes, in case. - I don't believe. - Yes, it's true. Show me. I want to see. I want to see what you do. What is so danger ? What is inside can be used for good or evil. Me too. Open it. I want to see everything. Is isotope. Unstable, yes. What is ... ? Up here! Turn up here! - What? The next street ? - Yes! Left! The alley ! Ah, it's locked! It's locked! All right. All right, at the very least, I deserve answers. - We were compromised, Brodien. - I figured that part out. We were supposed to meet at 10:15. - Extracted by 10:25. - I was late. -Yeah, and I want to know why. -Watch the door, please. There's a reason for protocol, you know that ? Where were you? Can we save the debrief for the flight back ? Didn't you try to contact agent Strum ? I told you, his life is at risk. But he's in deep cover, agent Bristow. That's part of the job description. Safety's on. Mountaineer to Shopkeeper, please respond. I need to use the bathroom. Then find another one, I'm busy. Mountaineer, this is Shopkeeper. Shopkeeper, your cover's been blown. We'll meet in the Ming Hai train yard -- 20 minutes. Wait a second. Wait. Wait, what are you -- how did you find me ? How did you find me ? Shopkeeper, do you copy ? They know where I am! They found me! They found me! What's happening ? Hello, Sydney Bristow. I heard about what you're wearing. I like it. But your work here in Shanghai -- not so good. You broke radio silence. Sloppy. Disappointing. Who is this ? What do you want ? I just got what I wanted. We're trackingyour radio signal right now. We know the building you're in. We're coming. They just tracked your broadcast ? - What are you doing ? - Trust me. No, I'm not just following you blind anymore. What's your plan ? I don't have time to type an itinerary. You do what I say, or you'll die. Now take off your shirt. That window's too small to climb out. I'm not climbing out. Close your eyes. - What the hell for ? - Close them. - Ow! That burns! - Better than a bullet. - Oh, my god! - Open. Ah, god! This part's gonna hurt more. - No. No, I don't need that. - It's the details that matter. Try not to scream. I'm almost done. All right, what is that for ? They'll be looking for two of us, so we're both gonna walk out of here alone. They're gonna kill me, aren't they ? They might. You've got to strut out of this club. - I don't strut. - Look at yoursel My ear hurts. We'll meet at the Ding Ha station. You won't need this. What are you gonna do ? They know what you look like. Come on already. How badly do you have to go ? In your complaint against agent Bristow, you  stated that your pursuers tracked you to the restroom ? Yes, ma'am, they did. When -- When I made contact with agent Strum. I wanted to help him. I made arrangements with agent Strum to meet him at the closest LZ in Jing An. My intention was to extract him. That wasn't your purpose in Shanghai. You were sent with one objective -- pick up surveillance photos from agent Brodien -- Yes, ma'am. Photos taken by agent Strum, whose cover had already been blown. That's presupposition. A  tip from an unauthenticated source, and you opted to change the objective of the -- I made a judgment call. You do understand that things don't always go as expected when you're in the field. I don't need a lecture from you. I've read your report. Even for you, agent Bristow, your arrogance today is appalling. It wasn't meant to be a lecture, director chase, just a reminder. With all due respect, it's been 12 years since you've been field-rated. Your poor judgment apparently cost a man his life. So, after dressing him up, you violated protocol yet again by leaving your contact alone. Mr. Brodien would have been killed otherwise. Miss Bristow, your record's a mess. Your consistent disregard for protocol obviously speaks to some larger systemic dysfunction. A psychological need to challenge authority. If the shanghai incident were an isolated one, then perhaps a warning would suffice here. But this is hardly the first time you've exhibited rogue behavior. What happened in Shanghai was not rogue. I was trying -- Miss Bristow, it's my turn to talk. I'm recommending to the board that you be stripped of classified clearance and assigned to the dispatch office at Langley. You're transferring me to the mailroom ? You'll report to officer Hermalin 8:00 A.M. On monday. Let me get this straight. Is this a permanent reassignment ? Technically, that's what a demotion is. I don't know exactly what you have against me, but my record has always been -- I resent you, and I'll tell you why. It's conduct like yours that endangers the CIA. It weakens us. It forces us to take a defensive posture. Wait a minute. Am I supposed to defend my record ? This is not a dialogue, miss Bristow. In Virginia monday morning. If this is your decision, director Chase, I will no longer burden this agency with the hazard of my participation. Are you opting to terminate your association with the CIA ? I will say it in English for you. I quit. Yo ! Vaughn. Vaughn ! Bag's dead, man. You can give it up. Thanks for coming. Thanks for sweating. You all right? Yeah, I think that a full month of psych evaluation's more than enough. Really? For you? I don't know. It was a little overkill, though. Come on. Burning your house down? It wasn't a happy home. Yeah, still -- fire. Yeah, well, you kill your wife after learning she's a vicious homicidal double agent. See how rational you are. I want you to know that I'm there for you, whatever you need. You know, if you need to stay with me for a while 'cause your house is... ashes. I'm leaving. Leaving what? The agency? Is this because of Sydney? It's not because of Sydney. It's because last year sucked. It's because I don't have the desire to do.. not the desire, the need to do this job anymore. I don't have it in me. So you're telling me that this stupid idea was all on your own ? Sydney didn't talk to you about this? I haven't spoken to her this week. Or last. I don't know what's going on -- You got to talk to her. Well, I've already made my decision. Okay, this isn't about you. Her review was today. Sydney quit. - Glad you found us. - Me too. That wouldn't have been a very good start. You did well with the committee. Very convincing. Thank you. So you were you. I actually felt like I was in trouble. Well, I can pull it out when I need to. Come on, let me show you around. How is that man's ear? Don't worry about Brodien. He thinks he's a hero. He has no clue Shanghai was a charade. The agency's pacific rim surveillance worked out of this office until '98. This place was dark until two months ago when Langley approved the division. Miss Chase, I can't tell you what an honor it is to have been asked to be part of this operation. I know you spoke of being hungry, looking for a fresh start.. That was nothing. My father, Vaughn -- irrelevant personal stuff. I want to serve my country the best I can. Well, this assignment will be a challenge for you more  than you were led to believe. The four of you were chosen. Handpicked to help run this team. The four of us ? Handpicked by whom ? This is exciting. Could I have a word, please? When I was approached about joining a black ops unit within the CIA, I thought I was doing the right thing. And while I appreciate the necessary protocol in assembling a new team, Arvin Sloane is not .. I understand you used to work for Sloane. Yeah, a criminal psychopath beyond verbal description. I know all about Sloane. Then allow me to ask the most obvious question in the history of time. How can the CIA let that man, who ran what amounts to a terrorist cell within the borders of this country, run anything ? You don't need me to explain the geopolitical landscape, or to list this country's former enemies with whom we now collaborate. You have to draw the line somewhere. We can use him now, his contacts, his expertise. And he will be closely monitored. Pity the man with that job. Wait a minute. With you here, Vaughn, Dixon, and your father, there's a built-in system of checks and balances. If Sloane missteps, you'll catch him. Now that's it. This is your assignment. I was just explaining how the CIA approached me. Concerned that increased public scrutiny of the agency and the resulting red tape has impeded their ability to do their job, what they asked me to set up for them is a covert unit, one that is still governed by U.S. Laws but unhampered by bureaucratic chain of command, with no accountability except to ourselves. That part was made clear. But the part that wasn't made clear, that's me. No, it wasn't. Well, quite frankly, I was surprised by their call, too, until I understood what it is they want. Their own SD-6 A unit that officially doesn't exist, comprised of team members who have no apparent affiliation to the CIA. They don't want to know how we do our day's work, only that it gets done. And what is our day's work? His name is Yuri Kamarov. He's Russia's leading nuclear scientist, until last month when he disappeared with the only viable sample of orine-12, a deadly and highly unstable isotope. Signal intercepts indicate that on thursday Kamarov will have a meeting on the train traveling between Belarus and Latvia. We can assume he will be selling the isotope. The CIA is unable to use that information, which is why we're here. Sydney, Vaughn, you will beon that train. I can't believe this. I beg your pardon ? Nothing. - The buyer, who is it? - We don't know yet. But according to his grocery list, we can assume he's a serious threat. We were able to intercept the protocol of the meet. The buyer will be in the dining car at 8:00 P.M. Greenwich mean time. There will be a green fountain pen on the table. He will ask Kamarov if he would like some tea. Kamarov will reply that he prefers Bourbon. Dixon, you will be on point. Sydney, you will recover Kamarov and the isotope. Vaughn, you will I.D. the buyer. You will sell him a bogus isotope outfitted with a tracking device so that Langley can follow him back to his base of operations and grab him there. Is that it ? Kamarov is known to rig his transport devices with self-destruct Yes, that's correct, so, Sydney, you'll need to get him to open the case for you. Do you have any suggestions? I assume you'll come up with something interesting. Jack, you'll set up the operational plan for wheels up, 0600 hours. Are there any questions ? Besides how'd you get this job? Sydney. Syd. What is this, A.P.O.? It's the name of our new organization. It's right on the door. Authorized Personnel Only. I thought it was fitting. Excuse me. I have to prep If I'd known Sloane was involved, not a chance. It was a little deceitful, right ? Yeah, but then I thought if I refused the job, I can't watch over Sloane. I'm having the same conversation with myself. You know, I told Langley that I wanted to step down as director. That  life, that suit was never for me. I belong in the field. And then the offer came from Chase. "An elite black ops unit" speech. Yeah, that's the one, and I was in. Look, I understand your reluctance to work with me, given.. well, given everything. But despite my former allegiance, my betrayal of you, of this country, you can't deny it. We were a great team. So I'll do this just once, and ask you to please give me a chance. One thing makes up for all this. Having you as my partner again. - Sorry to drop by. - It's okay. I miss you. I wanted to say that I miss you. I've been thinking, - obviously, about what .. - What, you were afraid to .. - I'm not afraid, but I .. - You didn't return my calls. That's 'cause I could feel what was happening. Can I come in ? If you come in, we both know what's going to happen. I don't want that. To jump right back in where we were before everything, to pretend like those years didn't happen. Well, that would be nice, wouldn't it? But they did. We need to take it slow, Vaughn. Yeah. You're probably right. - You ready ? - Ja, I think so. You ? Excuse me ! Hello ! This is a private compartiment. This is my room. This isn't your room. - Are you speaking English ? - Yes, I speak. See for me, this room ? Care for some tea ? No, I prefer Bourbon. You're early. I am eager to make exchange. As am I, mr. Kamarov. I..I am sorry. - Ticket is good, no ? - Yes, it's good. I was drink... in dining car... - too much. - Oh. Yeah. I am for sleeping now. Is there a place for changing ? Uh, yes. Bathroom. Thank you. You are cute. I like these framings. You want to do this in public ? Mr. Vadik is not afraid of the public, and neither am I. Is this okay for me ? I just got it. For you ? Yes. For you it's very... okay. You can't test power with toy from hardware store. When the more comprehensive tests are done, Mr. Vadik will forward you the other half of your payment. You're not very discreet. Terror happens every day. Around everyone. And no one notices a thing until something detonates. Mr. Vadik and I rely on that. What is your work ? I'm in chemical business. I knew something like that. - You did? - Yes. Because I look at your hands when I come in and I think, he uses brain more than hands. You look familiar. Sometimes people tell me I look like hockey player -- Alexei Kovalev. No. That's not it. Ah, perhaps we have met before. Maybe your boss, Mr. Vadik. Maybe I know him. What is this ? I don't know where you're from, but you're not Kamarov. Excuse me ? This is me. I'm getting off the train a little early. Find out who he is. Syd, they're on to us. Get out of there. There's one coming your way. Move ! What is it ? Get up. Here. Are you kidding ?! Syd, before we left, Jack came to see me with a message for you. Your father wanted me to remind you that in Belarus we're not gonna have a tactical team. So why is your father talking to you through me ? When I was in D.C., I know that you went to Wittenberg, and I know your father was there. What happened in Wittenberg? Sydney. You were never supposed to have found this. You want to tell me what happened in Wittenberg ? No, actually, I don't. We now know the men on the train were working for Roman Vadik, CIA's 26th most wanted. Vadik's résumé has him responsible for the Chunei blast in '86, Matsu in '89, over 12,000 dead total. Close personal contacts of mine have confirmed Vadik's cooperation with known terrorist cells in planning a major attack within the next six months. Close personal contacts ? - CIA wants Vadik. - Yes, that's right. What's the move ? Last year, a foreign agent working on infiltrating Vadik's operation made particularly good progress. She needs to be debriefed. I'm sending you, Sydney. I'll give you the details in my office. Lucky me. The agent working with Vadik's operation was with argentine intelligence. - Your daughter ? - Your sister. If Nadia's the one with intel on Vadik, why not debrief her yourself ? We went searching, Nadia and I, for an artifact built by Rambaldi. Its value immeasurable. And we found it. And we promptly handed it over to the U.S. government. That's how you got this position. You bought it. It turns out the pain that she felt as a result of her job was profound, something with which you're familiar. You think ? I tried to convince her to stay, to transfer over to the CIA. I knew she would be of great value here. But she chose to leave intelligence, to drop out. You're sure she really left ? Fake quitting seems to be all the rage. She's out. She's back in Argentina. She wants nothing to do with me or this life. You're awfully glib, Sydney. Nadia left you on bad terms. I suppose I have something to learn about being a father. I can see why you don't want to go. That wasn't meant to be glib. I still don't know why you think she'll talk to me. Because I see in her something I once saw in you, the need to work for what's right. And because you know what it is to put aside personal issues. And that, that's a gift. It's not a gift. What it's been is a necessity, and it's become a burden, and quite frankly, something I have run out of patience for. Vaughn, before she goes, you might tell her the truth. No, I'm not gonna be a conduit to your daughter. I've tried that before. You can imagine how well that went over. And, no, she didn't say anything, if that's what you're asking yourself. She hasn't said a word about anything that happened between the two of you. Which gives me an idea of what that is. And, Jack, I hope for Sydney's sake that I'm wrong. I'm guessing this isn't a personal visit. No. Roman Vadik. We need your help. Nadia, I need you to come back with me. No. Sydney... He was a good friend. Worked with me. Vadik killed him. Had his... head shipped back to our office. But I'll give you what I have. No one deals with Vadik directly. Everything goes through his lieutenant. - You want to write this down? - No, I got it. Kazu Tamazaki. Considers himself a modern samurai. Arrested five years ago trying to rob the Hasunaga asian museum in London. Escaped from police custody. Among the least of the charges against him. I hope that helps. Men like Vadik, like Tamazaki, they need to be eliminated. I can't. I can't. You do understand? Yeah. - I made penne. There was -- - This cannot continue. A crucial assumption of our operational competence is communication! Sydney, if we don't have that, every mission, the life of every operative, could be at risk. I'm doing my job. No. What you need to do is find a way to accept what's happened. If you can deal with Arvin Sloane -- I love that you knew that, that you approved it. It may be hard for you to accept that your father doesn't have the authority to make all the decisions that -- No, what's hard for me to accept are the decisions that you do make. What's hard is looking at you. Walking past you, smelling that sickening cologne. What's hard is being your daughter and not being able to separate myself as far as I may get from the person I despise the most. You went to see Nadia. Did you tell her what you know? I guess I thought that maybe you'd come here, I don't know, to give me something, information -- something that would help make sense of what I was afraid you'd become, but there's nothing you could say. Of course you were only looking out for yourself. Is that what you think of me as an operative? That I would reveal your secret to that poor girl? I didn't tell Nadia a thing. Sorry. What's going on? It was Lauren who told me. What? Told me where to look. Safety deposit box in Wittenberg. How she knew, I don't know. I wasn't even going to go. I had no reason to believe anything that woman said. But the curiosity was just too strong. I got there. Inside the box, there was a file. Classified. Highest level. My heart was pounding, like I knew somehow before I knew. What was it? Evidence. Evidence that my mother had been a security risk, which wasn't really news. It mentioned her history with the KGB-- everything we knew. Then there was a page. An official request made by my father asking for the authority to execute Irina Derevko. A request that was granted. And he did it. He killed her. He killed my mother. He did it, Vaughn. He killed her. He killed my mother. Two weeks ago, the man on the train, Kazu Tamazaki, severed ties with all known contacts, eliminated all means of communication. Any idea where he's gone or why? Nothing. Our one link to Roman Vadik has disappeared. Any indication Vadik turned on Tamazaki? All chatter says that Vadik is status quo. So Tamazaki is still all we've got. All we had. He's gone. Back to what we know. The Hasunaga asian museum in London. Yeah, Nadia said he was arrested five years ago-- a break-in. Was there a motive? He was caught in the Shintaro sword exhibit. Shootout, killed two MPs and one of his own men. What was he doing? Trying to steal the Shintaro sword, the most famous samurai sword outside of Japan, wanting to restore honor to the blade and to his country. You got to be kidding me. We may not have the means to contact Tamazaki, but I can see a way to get Tamazaki to contact us. Are you suggesting we fake a robbery of the Hasunaga? You think we should steal the sword. That museum's one of the world's most secure. If this were my operation, there's only one man I'd trust to get us in there. Hey, you as depressed as I am? Depressed about what? Depressed about what? Take a look around here. This place is a ghost town. I don't even know anybody here anymore. Sydney's gone, Dixon, Jack, Vaughn. The only guy we have left is Sark, and that's only because he's in custody. Hate that guy. I mean, really, kind of scar-- although I did go visit him twice, just to see a familiar face. We had eggs. Don't do that. Marshall Flinkman, you're under arrest for the misuse of government assets. Misuse? What? What did I misuse? Unauthorized computer equipment may be connected to the monitors you've been provided. Connected? I don't understand. What did I have connected? Is this yours? Uh... It was for a mission. I swear. I just wanted to download some maps from Conquer Quest. I heard they were really good. Of course, the CIA maps are much better -- Am I dead? You've been recruited. We're a black ops division, Marshall. You're going to head up technology. Uh, Syd... Sloane is here. We know. Okay. Syd. We're back. Merlin to team. Great. Way to go, guys. Stay focused. They're focused. Okay, Shotgun to Merlin. Tapping into surveillance. Okay, I can see it. The Shintaro sword. It's a studler matrix system. What am I looking for? - Okay, studler matrix. - What fuse? L7. Copy that. Looping l7. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! That would be bad. Don't do that. You need to re-route through E3. E3 rerouted. Okay, go to L7. Copy that. Looping L7. Okay, the security feed's looped. Outrigger, something fell down the vent. Cooney to control. Right, Cooney. Check floor two, would you? I think I heard something. No, it's all clear. You're still good. Hey... Good luck. Thanks. How cool is this? Stealing a sword so we can find a bad guy, you know, in order to catch an even bigger bad guy? Come on. Come on, you would never let us do this back in the CIA -- you know, when you were double-breasted serious robot Dixon. I mean, not that you -- you were just... authoritative. I'm sorry. Outrigger to base. ETA 90 seconds. Security cameras are on loop. So far, so good. The biggest challenge, hands down, is that pressure pad on the case. You know, the marble border. There's no way to deactivate it. Super-calibrated. Phoenix, you've got company. Tango headed your way. ETA 20 seconds. Phoenix, abort! Repeat, abort! I'm almost there. Phoenix, he's coming. Get out of there now! I'm almost there. Damn it! Phoenix to base. I'm in the East alley. I need an extraction now! Find a secondary route. We're at 60 seconds out. I don't have 60 seconds. I'll meet you at the LZ. I'm going. Sydney, get in. Get in now. You can be stubborn later. Outrigger, this is Raptor. I have Phoenix. Heading to rendezvous. What are you doing here? You know what else typically works in a situation like this? A simple "thank you". Get down. You didn't tell her, did you? The truth? I told her that I was responsible for the death of her mother. Did you tell her everything? She's better off not knowing everything. Tough call, Jack. Better that she detest me. I fear the alternative would have left her incapacitated. I assume you have something to sell. I have the Shintaro sword. Herr Vogel, you never cease to astound me. An inside job, no doubt, yes? No matter. People on the streets are impressed. An incredible job. My friends are good at what they do. Let me make a few calls. It's done. Good work. Head home. Dixon put the sword in play. We can expect to hear from Tamazaki within hours. It's good, isn't it? Having the team back together again. Hmm? Anything? Oh, uh, hey. Well, mostly what we already know. Roman Vadik is some serious bad news. Check this out. Pakistan -- 500 casualties. Prime minister of Kafiristan assassinated in broad daylight. Who's that? Uh, that's Pablo Martinez. He's an argentinean agent. He was investigating Vadik last year. He was caught. Vadik had him killed. Yeah. Martinez was partners with Nadia Santos. - Your sister? - Half-sister. Well, he was the only one who ever saw Vadik alive. I mean, at least on our side. He wasn't transmitting, was he, when he was captured? I'll make you a deal. You cooperate with us. That's it. You don't frighten me. Then clearly you're an idiot. The man you were working for on the train, Tamazaki, he referred to his boss -- Mr. Vadik. But we ran voice prints. Yeah, um, an agent was killed last year by Vadik, but his voice -- you know, the killer -- it matches perfectly with the man on the train. Tamazaki. Which means Vadik trusts Tamazaki enough to front for him, act on his behalf. Simple deduction says that if Tamazaki trusts you, you've seen Vadik. Where do we find Vadik? I'll need protective services for this. You help us, and you have my word. Vadik. You had him. Vadik is Tamazaki. There is no Vadik. It's a cover. He made him up. There's no Vadik. Vadik doesn't exist at all. It's actually Tamazaki who's in charge. We need a new gameplan. Yes? Tamazaki took the bait. We're set for a Wednesday meet in Rio de Janeiro. He insists that the woman who stole the sword make the delivery. Apparently he has access to police files. He was intrigued. What about backup? She's allowed one additional. Good. Jack, you escort Sydney with the sword. Vaughn, Marshall, you'll support Dixon. I want a plan by 1800. Excuse me. I'd prefer Dixon as my partner. I'm sure you're aware of our experience together in the field. That shorthand could be important. I've already made my assignments. - You good? - Yeah. As soon as Tamazaki makes contact, we'll I.D. and take out any backup he's got, then we'll move in, grab him, get on the plane. Team's in position. Mikes are hot. We've got full visual. Phoenix, Raptor, it's your show. Copy that, Outrigger. This is the best conversation we've had in weeks. Merlin, patch this call through my ear piece to the rest of the team. Okay, Phoenix, you are hot. And I mean that in many ways. Shotgun, you're in on the call. Hello? Look across the square. You'll see a tunnel. It will take you to the belly of the Alves building. Go to the 10th floor. No backup, no guns. Just the sword. Meet me in three minutes, or it's off. Merlin, the Alves building. Now listen, this building was converted into a bank last year. Shotgun, you're gonna have to look the part. Okay, we've got wardrobe. Let's do it. I'm going in -- alone. I assume you all heard that. Starting through the tunnel. Phoenix, meet me at the elevators before you go up. See you at the elevator. Okay, now that tunnel was reinforced after the earthquake of '44. We're probably gonna lose comms until -- Shotgun, we've temporarily lost contact with Phoenix. Merlin, tell me there's a 10th floor in this building. Guys... Hello, Sydney Bristow. If Tamazaki wanted to kill Sydney, we're already too late. The only assumption we can operate on practically is that Sydney is alive and Tamazaki has some need for her. So where is she? Rio was Tamazaki's call, not mine. It's his turf. Meaning he most likely has some sort of base here, satellite office maybe. Marshall, does Tamazaki's file indicate property holdings? I already checked. Nothing. Nothing in Rio, nothing anywhere in Brazil. We know someone with intel -- the agent who led us to Tamazaki in the first place. Well, my daughter has refused to cooperate. Still, she gave Sydney Tamazaki's name. If she were apprised of the situation, she might help. I'll make her help. Where is she? Hola? This is Michael Vaughn. I'm in Rio. Sydney's in trouble. Is it Vadik? Vadik and Tamazaki are the same person. Look, we don't know if Sydney's still alive, but if she is, you're her only hope. Nadia, please. Tamazaki used to run an operation near the Catedral Metropolitana. Okay, I'll need details. Sydney Bristow. What happened to the deal? What? What happened to the deal? Before you leave this room, you will tell me why. I might. I'm relatively open-minded. But in this case, I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Have you eaten breakfast? Why? You want to grab something? You probably ate breakfast. Just in case, we'll wait. It's been three months. What happened to you? It took longer then I thought to find your birthday present. I saw you standing in the park. I was looking for the woman who stole the Shintaro, and then I saw you, and I knew... this wasn't about the sword. So now you found out... about the hit. Which means you must know why you were spared, why the job went away. I told you, I don't know about any hit. You wouldn't be here if you didn't know about the contract. What contract? The contract I had on your life. You were hired to kill me? Who hired you? Sydney... assassin/client privilege. The day before the job, my client was killed. Most unfortunate... for me. I swear to god, I don't know anything about this. Somehow I believe you. I guess this was just one of those coincidences. Guess I can just sell you the sword and go home. I'll just take the sword. How's that? So, Nadia, the tranquilizer lips -- do you think it was too red? Does Jorge have the key card? Got it. I'm in. You'll be okay. Nadia. Sydney! Sydney! - Where's Sydney? - She went that way. I was told you were good. Who hired you? Who put a contract on my life? Who hired you? Derevko. Irina Derevko. Congratulations. We recovered the isotope, we've eliminated a dangerous enemy, and the british government is most grateful for american assistance in returning the Shintaro sword. I would also like to announce that Nadia has accepted my offer to join A.P.O. I know that she can rely on your full support in the days and weeks ahead. So, that's it. Go home. Feel good about what you've done. How did you find out? Tamazaki. He had the contract. You didn't know? I merely knew your mother had hired someone. I didn't know who. I had only one way to stop him. Why would she want me dead? I don't know. You killed her to save me. You killed mom to save me. I'll see you tomorrow. Syd. Syd, are you okay? Yeah. Thank you. See, I just -- I don't see it. You working at a bank? Come on, what kind of job is that, you know? Cashing checks and making change. "Excuse me, next in line, please." I'm a loan officer. I travel. Service accounts. Wait a minute, the cover job you had for SD-6? - I happen to be good at it. - Great. That's stimulating stuff. Watching someone else's cash. Syd, come on, seriously, since you left the spy biz, you are a bore. It's an adjustment, is all. Are you sure you don't want to stay for dinner? I'd love to, but I gotta save the world. See ya. Bye. - Hello. - Hi. I'm, uh, Eric Weiss, 38, single. - Nadia. - How are you? Good. Is this a bad time? Not at all. Nadia, this is Eric. He was just leaving. No, no, no. I can stay. Or go. Nice to meet you. You too. - Hey. - What's going on? I just couldn't wait. Even until tomorrow. I was hoping we could talk about our mother. Did you bring your passport? Our mother was killed. I found her body in a state medical facility. I identified her, paid for her release. Made arrangements with a mausoleum in Moscow three blocks from where she was born. I thought she'd want it that way. And you have no idea who was responsible, who killed her? No. I swear to god, somehow I will find out who did this to our mother... and I will kill him.
