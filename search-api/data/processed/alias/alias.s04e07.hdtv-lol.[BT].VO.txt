Highest national security. What is it? Russia's been developing Black Thorine. Developing? Researching. Producing. We've made some. We've only been able to distill a small amount -- 10 milliliters. Enough for a single vial. This government will stop at nothing to contain this information. So why tell me? Because the vial was stolen. By whom? This is the routing number to my superior's bank account. He's recently come into a great deal of money. Let's go. Sydney. We didn't expect you back so soon. - So, Russia was a success? - Yeah. There's a report waiting for you in the office. Sydney, he just dropped by. I didn't realize -- Get out. Very well. I'll walk myself to the door. I'll see you both tomorrow. Okay. He came by. Wanted to talk. He says he wants a fresh start, to get to know me. You think that's all he wants? A little father-daughter bonding? I know how you feel about him -- You can't possibly. I don't understand. You work with him at A.P.O. I accepted the job so I could watch him. Don't delude yourself, Nadia, into thinking you can trust that man. Do that, and you will end up hating yourself for it. He's my father. If you knew what he's done. Sydney, I know. I know what he did... to you. What he took from you. Your best friend. Your fianc√©. And knowing that, you still let him into my home? I'm not naive, Sydney. I'm not deluded. It's not easy to reconcile the past. I thought you had. The development of Black Thorine -- that violates how many treaties? Twelve, to be exact. Well, there's a reason. It's a mega-breakthrough in explosives. It's odorless, undetectable. I ran a simulation. Check it out. Huh? It leveled an entire city block. And that's just a little drop of Black Thorine. Imagine if you had the whole... vi-- it's actually a real depressing take on progress. Are we sure there's only one vial? The russians are stonewalling. They refuse to acknowledge the existence of a substance, much less admit that they're developing one. But my sources confirm that they're panicking. Your sources? If that vial is their only prototype, as intel appears to corroborate, its theft has set their classified weapons program back decades. Would you mind telling us where that intel comes from, or are we all supposed to rely on your sources, no questions asked? That's a fair question, but one I'm not inclined to answer unless you need me to explain the essential nature of confidentiality. No, I'm all caught up on that, thanks. What matters is that we recover the vial. We were able to trace the routing number the informant gave Vaughn. 2 million euros were deposited into the account of colonel Nikolai Voskov. The money came from this man -- Boris Tambor. The russian oil magnate? Tambor might have made his money in oil, but he's since diversified into mining, media outlets, and his latest venture, arms dealing. Seems Tambor's quite a player. High-end real estate all over Europe. He owns a fleet of sports cars -- Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Bentleys. This guy's living my junior high fantasy. Or my current one. Tambor keeps his entire operation mobile. Never stays in one place too long. Right now he's booked into the San Devotee in Monte Carlo. He takes a regular seat at the high-stakes poker table every night at 9:00. That will be your window. Your mission is to get into Tambor's suite, find out where he keeps the Black Thorine, how  he plans to move it. You leave tonight. Wheels up, 2200. You want to tell me about it? Sloane. He  was in my house. Last night. To visit Nadia. I came home. He was sitting in my living room. Oh. I thought I could do this -- work for Sloane again, but now... I don't know, I think I might have been kidding myself. I dream about Diane. Which isn't unusual, I've been told, except for me, it's almost every night. These dreams are always the same. At some point I get to her, and I hold her face. And I can see it in her eyes -- the disappointment in me. That I couldn't prevent what happened. Then... she tells me that she loves me, that she loves the kids, and she asks me to do the right thing. She doesn't ask me to, she tells me to. And that's how I make peace with Sloane. I don't put the past away or compartmentalize it. I transmute it. I make it the right decision today. I hope I'm capable of that. I know you are. I'm sorry about last night. It was my fault. My father's one of the reasons -- You  don't have to explain. I get it. When our mother came back, she -- she had done her share bad things. I know. But still, I needed to know her. I just did. Thanks. Nice shot. What's that, Gretchen? I don't buy you as a Gretchen. Nein? Whoa. Uh, okay. Okay, guys, we have one hour. You all know the drill. Surveille the room, get in, get out with the intel and the Black Thorine. Evergreen, maintain position. We're almost there. Okay, I'm in. Evergreen, you're clear. Inserting camera now. Ready for sound. Patching audio-visual feeds now. Copy that. Okay, I've got a visual on Tambor. Housekeeping. Oh, I'm sorry. I ordered a french maid. Here you go. The laptop is our first priority. After that, we go for the PDA. What the hell's going on? I thought this guy hits the tables every night by 9:00. That's what we know. Yeah, well, it's 9:06. Oh, here we go. What's he doing? Look at that room. That's nice. Check out those digs. Marshall, what soccer match is that? Uh, hold on. Let -- sorry, I'm not much of a sports fan. More of a scrabble club type. Boggle tournament if I'm feeling dangerous. Guys, Tambor owns the team. He's kidding, right? So he's in for the night. He checks out first thing tomorrow morning. If we don't get in there tonight, get the data off that computer, we lose him. Wait a minute. I hate that perfume. It was a weird patchouli smell. See under the bed? The slingbacks? Champagne bottles on the nightstand. Check out the magazines. Designer purse. It's a shot. What's a shot? What are you talking about? I know where to get what we need. Where's she going? You mind filling us in? Tambor's got a girlfriend. She's staying with him. She's our way in. We have no intel on that woman. You'll be going in blind, Sydney. We know enough. She has gossip rags all over the room, which means she's fine making a mess, so we know she's not a one-night stand. Her shoes cost more than most people's monthly salary, so she either has money of her own or access to Tambor's. Either way, empty champagne bottles, her side of the bed. This girl likes to party. But her boyfriend would rather stay in and watch TV their last night in Monaco than hang out with her, so she's bored. Most likely pissed off. How do you propose to find her? Well, she left her handbag. She didn't go far. In fact, I'm guessing she's hitting the hotel bar right now. All Nadia and I need to do is get to her and get her to take us to the room. - Why are you smiling? - I don't know. Where'd you get this stuff? I borrowed them. You stole it, didn't you? She stole the stuff. Nadia, this could jeopardize the entire mission. Tambor's security team saw you. If they recognize you as the maid, they will not hesitate to take action. With all due respect, no one pays attention to the help. I promise they won't recognize me. Patchouli. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What do you mean? Well, guess what? I'm sick of your pathetic excuses. He's not coming. You still have his charge card, right? Oh, my god. Madame? - Two. Please. - D'accord. Men suck, don't they? Usually. I  swear to god, I am so not that clumsy. Don't listen to her. She's incapable of holding her liquor. Shut up! Need I remind you of Ibiza? You and the DJ with the handcuffs? I'm ignoring you now. Watch. Just a warning. Just a warning. My boyfriend? He's kind of a jerk. Like mine isn't. Are you just going to stand there? I'm sorry, miss Bridget. They call me miss Bridget. Okay. They're doing it. They're in the room. Mr. Sloane, I know how against this you were, but if Sydney chooses to say "I told you so"... - She's not out yet. - That's true, but they're good. They're really good. I need five minutes to change, and we are leaving. Make yourselves at home, ladies. What's the score? Devils 1, Lautrec 3. Slovak will come back. Last year, second half against Madrid, Roscoe's diving header in extra time? The best goal ever. Beckner  is a great midfielder. Not too bad on the eyes, either. For what I'm paying him... What do you mean? It's my team. Shut up. Shut up! You own the Slovak Devils? Felicia, did you hear that? She's cloning the hard drive, and he's in the room. How the hell does she know about the Slovak Devils? Was that in the file? Maybe she's a soccer fan. Oh, god, this is the greatest girl ever. She got it. I didn't know you liked soccer. I do now. Oh, by the way, it's called futbol. - I'm sorry. - Futbol. - Futbol. - Fut. Right. Right. If I can be honest, the back four are solid, no question, but watching defensive footie is a little bit boring. - Not to me, huh. - It's your money. Donata, can you believe that hag is dating the prince of Greece? Oh, god. Doesn't she have any friends who can tell her she looks like trash? Did you see that? She just palmed the PDA from his jacket. That's magic, man. I showed her that with, like, a business card. It's like, fazham! She's amazing. - I get it. - She's incredible. - Fazham? - Yeah, fazham. Nice. They're doing it. They're cloning tambor's PDA. She's good. Oh, my god, those boots are horrific. I own those, bitch. Wouldn't be weird for you, would it, if we were dating sisters? Reno's lost his step since the knee surgery. You should replace him. Idiot! Nadia's still got his PDA. Come on. Extraordinary. Oh, my god. That dress is magnificent. - My PDA. - Oh, god. Anton! Search these two. Check their bags. - You can't be serious. - Where did you find them? My god, this is insane. Is this what you're freaking out about? - You better go now. - Yeah, you think? You were right. Your boyfriend is a total drag. Come on. You were given a direct order, one you chose to disregard. We gathered the necessary intelligence. That is not the point, Nadia. You report directly to me. I assessed the risks and determined that they were too great, and still you both chose to defy orders. We did what we were tasked to do, end of story. I should remind you. You answer to me. You're right. We disregarded a direct order. It won't happen again. Just so we don't have these misunderstandings again, let me be clear to both of you. Questioning my authority, whether it's in this office or in the field, is unacceptable. Unacceptable? Coming from you, that's almost funny. Sydney, please. Do you really want to engage in a conversation about what is and what is not acceptable? Every day I work here, I see your face in briefings, I hear your voice in my ear during missions, and you want to know what it's like? It makes me sick to my stomach. Having to pretend the past never happened, that you're not the same murderous criminal sociopath you were three years ago, it makes me want to retch. If you want to talk unacceptable, that is unacceptable. I assumed that you had accepted the fact that I made amends for my past. Amends? Francie and Danny are gone, and yet here you are. And everywhere I look, I'm reminded of the man who killed them. I see. Hey, uh, Tambor's encryption program -- I broke it. It was kind of brilliant on my part, but then again the data itself was coded, so I had to cross-reference it -- Marshall, what is it? Well, it looks like the sale of Black Thorine -- it's going down in 16 hours. - We'll be right there. - Okay. You should hurry. The situation is critical. Tambor is selling the Black Thorine aboard his yacht, the Argento. We have less than 16 hours to get on that boat and retrieve the stolen vial. According to harbor master records, the Argento is sailing in the black sea in protected waters off Turkey, which  means we have no choice but to go in stealth without the cover of night. Do we know who the buyer is? No, but we do have an idea where the Black Thorine is being stored. Here, in a cabin below dark. Marshall. Okay, here is the schematic of the vault that you'll be dealing with. It's secure, built into the bulkhead, old school. So whoever is going in, you are going to need... these. Uh, your basic safecracking tools. - Sounds simple. - Not quite. Now, I found some receipts on tambor's hard drive. Turns out he bought a condor TL-60 free-standing safe last month. I did some measurements, and oddly enough, it fits perfectly within the vault, so I think it's safe to assume Tambor has a safe within a safe. He's certainly paranoid enough. How do we crack it? The condor uses a time-synchronized lock. It randomizes a combination every 60 seconds. Now, the combination appears on a key card with an LCD screen. Now, we can assume that Tambor will have it on him, so... you're gonna need this. This is a handheld wireless monitor, and this right here -- Will you marry me, mr. Bristow? It's a wave millimeter camera. It will allow you to read the combination through his clothing, assuming he's not wearing a lead girdle, which is doubtful. But you understand my point. There's a jet standing by. This is a high-risk mission. No backup. Vaughn, Dixon, this is your op. I'm sending you to the ship. If you don't mind, I'd like to finish what I started. So would I. They are the two best divers. For me to send them after the way they behaved in Monte Carlo, not to mention the way Sydney just behaved in my office, would be tantamount to rewarding them for insubordination. I thought I would have your support on this. Arvin, the nuance of fatherhood may elude me, but there's one thing I am sure of. You are not going to forge any kind of bond with Nadia if you attempt to keep her from working with her sister. I told him, if you don't win us next game, you're going to suffer a painful training injury, huh? Is that why you doubled his salary? Ha. Phoenix to base, we're on deck. Proceed with caution. Copy that. We're moving in. We're going below deck. We'll be radio silent until we reach the safe. Roger that. Black label. But of course. Phoenix, we have a visual. Copy that. Switching to millimeter wave. Freeze it there. Save it. Stand by. Enhancing the image. I always believe in pleasure before business. But, that being said... Marshall, rewind the feed. Is there a problem? Pull up everything we have on Leo Orissa. Leo Orissa... okay. Anton, get the man what he came for, huh? If you don't mind, I would like first for my chemist to conduct a little test, uh... a precaution. - Ready. - Copy that. Scanning Tambor for the latest combination. Code is 4-2-6-8-7. Oh, my god. We need a bigger case. Close it up -- now. So, you never told me -- what do you plan to do with your purchase? It is interesting, actually. We plan on taking control of your entire operation. This guy... You know this guy? He's an old friend. Bad-ass friend. You don't treat a girlfriend like that. Phoenix, Evergreen, do you copy? I repeat, do you copy? Phoenix to base. Tambor and his men are dead. Ambushed. By Leo Orissa, head of a russian organized crime syndicate. I used to work with him when I was head of SD-6. He has a link on the inside. The girlfriend fed him everything he needed. They're in possession of the vial? A lot more than a vial. At least 10 canisters. 10 more -- must have reverse-engineered it. Which means they're manufacturing it. Tambor has a lab somewhere. Orissa must know where it is. Orissa's associates are most likely securing the Black Thorine for transport. Nadia, can you take them out alone? I think so. Given my history with Orissa, I believe he'd be willing to talk. How? Sydney, in order for this to work, you're going to have to listen to me. You're going to have to trust me. Hello again. My employer won't be happy if you pull that trigger. Your employer? Who the hell do you work for? Tell him. I work for Arvin Sloane. He's demanding 50%? Including all future profits from this venture. Arvin always had an odd sense of humor. I came unarmed out of respect so that we could talk like gentlemen. You are not seriously considering making a deal with this woman. Do not let her derail this, Sydney. I'd keep my mouth shut if I were you. You're the one who made it easy. You practically drew us a map. You? You led Sloane to me? I thought she was just some kind of -- Fine. I agree to his terms. Ask for insurance. Mr. Sloane will be pleased. Of course, he needs a sign of good faith. What more does he want? The location of the lab. Don't move. Mention my friend, dr. Chaleb. What I did to him after he betrayed me. I assume you haven't forgotten dr. Chaleb. What sloane did to him. The sound of his own screaming woke him up. He saw everything burning around him, including his own flesh. The fire, the smell of his own flesh burning, the screams. I imagine he spends his days, nights wishing that I had finished the job. Wishing that he were dead. His body doesn't work, but his mind does. He's a living corpse. Sloane didn't show enough mercy to kill him. Let me tell you something I know. Arvin Sloane is cruel. He's inhuman. If you make this difficult, he will come after you. And not just you. Your friends will not be spared. Your family will not be spared. If he chooses to let you live, you'll spend every waking minute of your life reminded of what he's caused you. Word to the wise -- give him what he wants. The lab -- it's in the ukraine. Khmel'nitsky. You son of a bitch! Phoenix to base. We're ready for pickup. You have no idea how glad I am to hear that. I'll call the chopper. Arvin. You did what you had to do. Yes. Although I imagine it's the last time I'll be working with your daughter. You did a good job. I was gonna say the same thing to you. I never imagined this. I didn't even know spies were real until I was recruited. From school? From our juvenile detention home. When I was young, I was reckless... angry. I remember one judge said he thought I was lost. He wasn't wrong. My training agent used to tell me I was good at getting in and out of situations without being noticed. Not to mention I had no one -- no family, no ties. I couldn't be compromised because I was alone. I always thought that's what made me a good spy. And now? I might have been wrong. - Just say stop anywhere. - Stop. Okay. Is that your card? No. This wasn't your card? It is not. Are you sure? It's not at all my card. Okay, i think you're lying, but hold on to that. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. Well, that's never happened. - I'm sorry. - Hold on one second. - What was your card? - Queen of spades. The queen of spades? You said that wasn't your card. It is not. How did you do that? This is incredible. Well, it's not incredible. It's child's play. I've got a million of them. Your smile is so unbelievable. We going? Uh, yeah, we're going. We're just flirting here if you mind. Sorry. Langley is pleased. They located the production facility for Black Thorine. The raid was successful. I'm happy to hear it. So, Sydney, I contacted Chase. She's expecting a call from you regarding a transfer from this unit. Given your sentiments, I assume that's what you want. I want to make something clear. I will never forgive you for what you've done to me, to the people I love.
