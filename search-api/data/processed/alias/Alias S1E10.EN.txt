I was sworn to secrecy, but I couldn't keep it from my fianc√©. And when the head of SD-6 found out, he had him killed. That's when I learned the truth, SD-6 is not part of the CIA. I'd been working for the people I thought I was fighting. I went to the only place that could help me take them down. Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA, where my handler is Michael Vaughn. Only one other person knows what I do. Another double agent in SD-6. Someone I hardly know. My father. Who killed Kurtz? Who killed Hecht? Whoever did that gave Eloise Kurtz that pin. - It's on. - Ring him back right now. You have questions about Kate Jones. How far are you willing to go, Mr Tippin? I need to hear the words. It's an anomaly, sir. While Sydney was in the bank vault, there was an additional transmission out of Geneva. You've been sent to find a mole. When I look at Sydney's test results, I don't see a spike. She didn't falter. Sydney Bristow is the mole. - Yeah? - We got her. We've known for some time that we had a mole. That someone was working against us. When you were in Geneva with Agent Bristow, we picked up a transmission. Third party. It confirmed what some in Security Section believed for weeks. That Agent Bristow was that mole. When you were in the field with Bristow, there was no indication? Nothing. We need to determine the extent of damage done to us. What can I do? Convince Bristow that we believe you are working together and that if she won't tell us what she's done, we'll torture you to death. Will that work? Threat to colleagues is a fundamental interrogation technique. Sydney in particular. Yes, I think that she will respond. Mr Russek? We need to make it appear that you were questioned. - They think I'm part of this. - What do you mean? Don't play games with me. You know what I'm talking about. A transmission was sent from our position in Geneva. At the bank. They know it was one of us. They want to know how much damage has been done to them. There's only one person that can answer that question. Sydney, I don't know who you're working for. But I need you to tell them what you know. They said they were gonna kill me. Slowly. - Do you believe them? - They're not bluffing. Do you believe them? Yes. Has Sydney Bristow moved her desk? No, Security Section cleared it out an hour ago. Get on your knees, put your heads to the floor. Now. Sloane wants to know if you're ready to talk. No. Tell him I have nothing to say. Steven, what's going on? Talk to me. - What do you know? - What do I know? - Talked to Sloane? - I came to you first. Jack, do me a favour... I need you to tell me what's happening. You didn't hear this from me. While Sydney and Russek were in Geneva, a transmission was recorded. - It was not one of ours. - They think it was Sydney? This is not the first indication that she might be working for someone else. What exactly do they know? Jack, I'm sorry. My name is Sydney Bristow. I've seen you in the office. I always wondered what you did. I guess this is what you do. Sir, I think you should see this. All I'm saying is, maybe you and I should talk before we get started. Change of plans. For the past few weeks, you've been under suspicion. We knew we had a mole. There were signs that indicated that it was you. When you were in Geneva, we picked up a third-party transmission. It seemed to confirm that you betrayed SD-6. Now what I just learned is that it wasn't your transmission. It was Russek's. Russek? What is this? What the hell is going on? I wanna talk to Sloane! No. Sydney, I never believed that you would betray us. When I realised that it was Russek who was the mole... ...I felt vindicated. - That's impossible. - I know. In Geneva, Russek was transmitting to K-Directorate at the same time you were transmitting to the CIA? And that SD-6 picked up his transmission, not mine. There's no record of contact between him and Russian intelligence. In the cell, I asked him questions about his interrogation. When he said they threatened to kill him, he was blinking. A classic indication that he was lying. So I didn't talk because I knew he wasn't in real danger. Either Sloane still thinks I'm the mole... If Sloane still suspected you, he wouldn't let you go free. Or two, Russek is K-Directorate. - Or three... - Russek was a sacrificial lamb. That he was innocent and was set up to get me out. At first, I thought maybe it was the CIA. It wasn't us. The truth is, Russek could have been K-Directorate. So let's just assume you're the luckiest girl in town. Sorry that I called you at the weekend. I needed to talk to you. You don't ever have to apologise for calling. Speaking of which, - I got you something. - What? No, you didn't! I was in this store, this little antique place. What were you doing in an antique store? I don't know. Whatever. Look, if you don't like it, don't tell me. OK. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Is "hard" a word? - It's crazy. - Time's up. - Hold on. Will? - Who goes first? - OK, Amy? - No, Will. - OK. - Numps. - That's not a word. I challenge. - I think it is. - Numps is totally a word. You're questioning this? Here. "Numps. A fool, a blockhead." Alright. Your brother's so annoying. - I got numps, too. - What? Damn it! Dude. I gotta go to work. I'm sorry. OK, can we all have a talk about what you do for a living? I know. These bankruptcies. It doesn't make sense any more. Nobody works as hard as you. It's not like you're a brain surgeon, you get called to save a life. Bankruptcies. How much do they pay you to live like this? Not enough. I'm gonna call them and quit for you. - Will, I can't quit my job. - Why? You just have to be the greatest banker? It's my job. I want to do it well. Congratulations. Me, too. But at what cost? Syd, I think you're acting like a numps. To you, my job might seem pointless but it's far from pointless. I you knew what I dealt with, you might even thank me for doing my job so well. What the hell are you talking about? Nothing. I'm going to work. I'll see you guys. Ineni Hassan is a wanted man. He's been selling arms to K-Directorate and is looking to partner up with one of a number of rogue nations. This is the last photograph of Hassan taken a month ago in Madrid. We've put a lot of manpower into finding him, but found nothing. Last week, thanks to Bristow, we seized a majority of Mr Hassan's private assets. We were hoping that would help us to smoke him out. We think it has. SIGINT picked up communications originating from this private island. - What's there? - Private resort. More hideout than hideaway. It's a fugitive's paradise. Extradition's notoriously lax. It's heavily secured, but anyone can buy entry for a price. - You think Hassan's there? - No, it's not likely. But it gives us a lead. Severn Driscoll, former resident of the UK, master forger, military advisor and now self-employed. Semba Island has been his home over the last 12 years. You think Driscoll made Hassan new identity papers? It's our best bet. Go as Victoria King, daughter of an industrialist. Your assignment is to locate Driscoll, and ascertain the new identity of Ineni Hassan. Sydney, I heard about what happened. Are you alright? I'm fine. Russek. - That was a shock. - You didn't... What? Have anything to do with that? What, do you mean did I engineer it somehow? No, of course not. He was killed. Russek, last night. In Kenya, if you find Driscoll and Hassan's new identity... I'll keep it away from SD-6 and give it to you. - You hear that? - What? That pitch. Definitely nine-millimetre. That's a close-range hit. Twice in the chest, once in the head. Yeah. It's how Eloise Kurtz was killed. Whoever sent me this tape wants me to hear it. - Why would he want that? - You don't know it's a he. You hear that? That delay before the last one? That's the one in the head. - Can we isolate that? - I can improve on it. This tape was made from that pin. Whoever paid that girl to say she was Kate Jones is the same person who gave her the pin and sent the tape. No. Someone else could have given her the pin. Or replaced the one she had. Even then, this thing was on a wireless transmitter. Someone else could have made this tape. We're getting somewhere. Why would someone send the fake Kate Jones and want me to hear this? - Wait. - Did you tell him about SD-6? - What was that? - Did you tell him about SD-6? - About SD-6? - SD-6. SD-6? Play that back. Did you tell him about SD-6? What the hell's SD-6? I'm sorry that I was snippy with you about my job. You know, you're allowed to be. No, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I was a jerk. You don't have to apologise to me. I was just... I just see you working so hard. I know. That's why I'm here. I was talking to Francie. I need to do something that's not job-related. So maybe the four of us should go to Lake Arrowhead for a few days next week. - I've got a trip tonight. - Of course you do. But I am off all next week. Yeah, I'm in. - What? - You're not here alone. Hi, Jenny. Do you wanna come in? No, thanks, I'm gonna go. - OK. Good to see you, though. - You, too. - Bye. - Bye. May I help you? I'm Victoria King. You're expecting me. Welcome to Semba Island. Let me check on your suite. This place you're going to is swank. Super swank. Which is why I made you these puppies. Not only do they take pictures and have telephoto lenses, but... ...they're super swank. I'm sorry. Miss King, your suite is ready. - Enjoy your stay. - I'll try. - I'm very sorry about the music. - Excuse me? Sometimes when I drink too much, I play my music too loudly. Last night, I drank too much. I didn't hear any music last night. That's impossible. You are the man from suite 47? No. I wish I were. - Severn Driscoll. - Victoria King. You look familiar. Where are you staying? I'm a resident here. Suite 350. You have a standing invitation. I'm so embarrassed. I like loud music. I'll see you around. Mr Stoller? Hi. I'm Will Tippin. I left you a message. How are you doing? I'm a reporter doing research on something called SD-6. I did a search on it. One match. A deposition from a case you tried. The People versus David McNeil? David McNeil's an old friend of mine. Do you recall a reference to SD-6? No, I'm sorry, I don't. Discovery lasted years. Well, I'm really trying to figure out what exactly SD-6 is. Do you think that maybe Mr McNeil was a part of it? McNeil is a regular guy, a computer programmer. He started a business people wanted to buy. One company wouldn't take no for an answer. When David said no, that same day, the Government started an investigation. He was charged with larceny and sentenced to 16 years. If he was such an innocent, why did he plea-bargain? His wife killed herself. His daughter, my goddaughter, now lives with my wife and I. David wanted nothing to happen to her. You're saying you think Mrs McNeil was murdered? Cellphone, right? Obviously a cellphone, but observe. This unscrambles any standard Jericho keycard system, which is what they use on Semba Island. Who the hell are you? Where the hell is Severn? He was supposed to meet me here 20 minutes ago. You are pointing a gun at me. - Who are you? - Who am I? Look at me, look closely. You don't know this face or who I am? No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry you had to see that. Ineni Hassan doesn't just have a new name, he has a new face and is living in Havana. He's now using the alias Nebseni Saad. And as you know, he's broken an agreement with SD-6. He has stolen from us. The whole community is watching. We need to set an example with Hassan. Any intel about where in Havana he is? No, we don't know. That's why I'm sending you to Cuba. I need you to rendezvous with the usual contacts. Locate Hassan and take care of him. - Thank you. - I heard about Russek. And now with Hassan... I understand it's been a difficult week. One night... Now, this is years ago. Maybe two years before you and I met. I'd just finished my first Far East briefing at the White House. I was new to the CIA. After that meeting, everyone got into a limousine to head back to Langley. But I didn't. I told them I was gonna walk for a while. They looked at me funny. It was a cold night. So I said, "I need to get some air." But the truth is... ...I was overcome. It occurred to me as I was walking down the White House steps that I was living in a perfect moment. Everything was filled with promise. My role in the CIA, my relationship with the wife that I had not yet met. Still, I could feel a darkness coming. So I wandered around for a while. Ended up at the Jefferson Memorial. It was always my favourite one. I looked out across the basin, Lincoln right there. I didn't know how it would finally materialise. The darkness. I had nothing to base it on. It wasn't as if the CIA had just betrayed me, or my wife had just been diagnosed with lymphoma. None of that had happened yet. So whenever life takes an unfortunate turn, as it has this week, I just remind myself... ...that I could see it coming all along. I want Hassan dead, before the weekend. Hassan's new identity is Nebseni Saad. And... This is his passport number. I got back to LA this morning and met with Sloane. I told him Kenya was a failure, that I didn't find out Hassan's new identity. Sloane found out last night that Hassan, or whatever his name is now, is in Cuba. Sloane sent your father to Cuba to kill Hassan. After your father met with Sloane, he met with me. I'm leaving for Cuba in 30 minutes. What's the countermission? Sloane might want Hassan dead but the CIA needs him alive. We need his client list. It'll tell us what weapons he sold. It's invaluable. I don't need a lesson in the arms trade. Fine. Go to Cuba, use your contacts, get to Hassan. But instead of taking him out, you'll tell him the truth. That SD-6 sent you to kill him. Convince him that you're turning on SD-6. Say you're willing to fake his death in exchange for his client list. - You're making a huge mistake. - Am I? Trusting a man like Hassan. There will be a CIA team at the location where his death is to be faked. Hassan will never be a free man again. That's all that happened? That's it. Your father's getting Hassan for the CIA. - What? - Nothing. I gotta go, I've got friends coming. - Francie, right? - Yeah, and Will. Will. - I'll see you. - OK. Hassan will never be a free man again. I'll make contact by 6pm tomorrow. I got a copy of Russek's transmission. The one SD-6 intercepted. I also went through the CIA logs and compared the two. They don't match. You fixed the transmission. Made it look like Russek by altering the signal's point of origin and changed the message content. Who in the hell do you think you are, checking up on me, pulling my file, second-guessing my choices? Let's just both face the facts. You're not that person. Neither your experience nor your intelligence has earned you the right to question a thing that I do. So, I'm gonna make two suggestions. One, that you stop it, and two, that the next time they assign you to be my handler, you kindly decline. - Russek never transmitted. - Of course he didn't. If you got the SD-6 transmission, why ask me? I never got the SD-6 transmission. It was just a hunch. I'd just learned that my daughter was about to be tortured, Mr Vaughn. Most likely executed. I had no time to go for help. Some monitors went out. I want you to check every connection. Now. I knew that altering the transmission was a dangerous gamble. They could have detected a disruption but it was all I could do. And now you can judge what I've done. I don't give a damn what you do. Syd? Thank you. Still got the shoes on? Have you ever even worn snowshoes before? Get with the programme. There's an art form to this. - What's that? - Nothing. - Some guy from work gave that to me. - Not Dixon? No, he's still recovering. Some other guy. - Do I know him? - No, he's no one. Really? Just some guy? That's nice. It's nice that he'd give you that. I know. It was weird. - Why, how come? - I don't know. - Maybe he likes you. - No. - Maybe he does. - No. Not the way Jenny likes you. She looked nice in your shirt. - It's a nice shirt. - Nice and snug. - Easy with the cheap shots. - It was flattering. Whatever. I was just saying... - Will? - OK. The Iron Chef needs me. This guy gave her a Christmas present. Some guy from the office. Some guy. - So? - You didn't know about it? Know what? What's to know? I did hear about you, though. - About what? - You and the little cheerleader. First of all, she's not a cheerleader any more, Secondly, it doesn't mean anything. I found this old picture of me and my father. I was staring at it. For some reason, I remembered asking him about Santa Claus. - Santa Claus? - Yeah. If he was real. If Santa Claus was real. My father would answer me in this flat, factual way. "Yes, of course he's real," every time. The thing is I knew that he was lying. That's why I'd ask him again. When I questioned him about Russek, he was the same way. I wanted to believe him, but looking at that stupid picture, I realised. Russek wasn't K-Directorate, he wasn't the guilty one. - I was. - Sydney. Russek did nothing wrong. Because of my father, he was killed. Russek wasn't such an innocent. You wanna know about Russek? He was an early member of SD-6. He knew they were the bad guys. He was the leader of at least a dozen operations that stole weapons, chemicals and intel and sold them to enemies of the United States for cash to fund more SD-6 operations. Just like the one that killed your fianc√©. He got what he deserved. If you know so much about Russek, then you know he wasn't with K-Directorate. It seems he was sacrificed, yes. See, that's not a choice my dad can make. What would you have done had it been your daughter or your son? Or Danny? Listen, I've something else. In Cuba, your father made contact with an old informant, a Havana insider, who set up the meeting between your father and one of Hassan's men. What happened? Sydney, Hassan has your father. - What's being done? - We have a team in place in Havana. But Devlin doesn't wanna move yet. He says sending a team to scour the countryside will only attract attention we can't afford. You said you understand what my father did for me. That he couldn't just wait and do nothing. Then you'll understand that I'm going to need your help to get to Cuba. Hi. I'm Will Tippin. - David McNeil. - Thank you for meeting with me. Do you mind if I...? - No, that's alright. - Great. In the letter you sent, you weren't real specific. You're doing an article on encryption software? Yeah. No, not really. I mean, it's an interesting topic. It's timely, and you know, we can do that. - So, why are we sitting here? - I'm researching something. It's called SD-6. I don't have anything to say about that. Why? Why don't you tell me what you know? - I don't know anything. - Tell me what you suspect. I don't suspect anything. I met with Robert Stoller. - He told me about your wife. - Listen to me. You stay away from him. You understand? Don't talk to him again. My men, they told me that you have contacted them. How? I knew who to ask and who to ask for. Nebseni Saad. That's your new name. I know it, SD-6 knows it. - SD-6? Your employer? - Yes. They will learn what happens when they send someone after me. Wait. I have an offer to make. That's why I'm here. You think SD-6 ripped you off, so you stole from them and you disappeared. Now they've stolen your money and they want you dead. SD-6 will never kill me. You're too smart to believe that. Think about Isaac Lohan or Uli Schr√∂der. They will find you. They have a photograph of you from Semba Island. How? That's the question you'll ask before they kill you. - What's your offer? - You have something of value to me. Your client list. I want it. Not for SD-6, but for me. For my own personal use. You give me your client list and I'll give you your freedom. How? We'll fake your death, you and I together. I'll return to SD-6, show them the photographs, they'll think you're no longer a problem. You'll be free. How do I know that you're not setting me up? How do I know that if I give you my list that I've worked decades to assemble, that you're not simply going to shoot me anyway? Because you can trust me. Think about it. I'm the one who contacted your men. If I was here to kill you, all I had to do was wait, keep my mouth shut. You didn't know you'd been ID'd with your new face. I could've popped you in the head like a deer. If you say yes to this, we both win. Big. If you say no, we both die. It's your call. - Interesting. - What? Well, I think you make a good offer. But I still don't know if I can trust you. So prove to me that you are willing to go against SD-6. - Anything. - You say you came alone? - Yes. - There's someone else here. Someone who works for SD-6. Here. Kill her.
