I was sworn to secrecy, but I couldn't keep it from my fianc√©. And when the head of SD-6 found out, he had him killed. That's when I learned the truth. SD-6 is not part of the CIA. I'd been working for the people I thought I was fighting. I went to the only place that could help me take them down. Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA, where my handler is Michael Vaughn. Only one other person knows what I do. Another double agent in SD-6. Someone I hardly know. My father. I don't want this job any more. I want out. You're helping bring an end to SD-6. - Not any more. - Sydney. - You like hockey. The Kings? - How'd you...? They're playing the Islanders next week. We should go. You can't do this. - It's suicide. - I don't think it is. What is your exit strategy here? Cole. Emergency lockdown procedures. The elevator is returning to SD-6. The doors will automatically open. What do you want? There's a certain little something you got in the SD-6 vault. Sloane's activated the emergency fail-safe. There are 500lbs of C4 within this building's substructure. Opening the vault will trigger that C4. You want to scramble the vault codes. - Dad, what are you doing here? - Just stay there. - No, Dad, don't. - Hold your fire! I'm coming through! I'm coming out! Are you OK? Except for my head injury, yeah. Mr Cool Customer here was caught crawling around the vents. Sit his butt down. How long's it gonna take to open the vault? The sooner I get started, the sooner I'll know. I need, like, awesome good news, baby. I know. Endo, Tchen, I'll be in the conversation room. Follow this map to the three locations where the explosives are. You must deactivate all three C4 packages before the vault door opens. Good luck. I can get to the PDA and email Langley. - That's not an option. - Look. We need plausible deniability here. - The CIA cannot acknowledge SD-6. - I know that. But we can't afford to let these people get whatever it is they want. Do nothing. The man running this group claims to be former SD-6. Sloane left him for dead in Chechnya. He's interrogating Sloane now. Maybe killing him. And we're next. Sydney's in the ducts. - What? - The fail-safe's been activated. If the vault's opened, it'll detonate C4 charges hidden throughout the building's sub-level. Sydney has a chance to disarm them, but only if there are no surprises. All the more reason we need to call Langley. Jack, under normal conditions, you can pull rank. These are not normal conditions. Each set of charges is located behind the steel plate at the end of the corridors marked on the map. - Two numbers down. Ten to go. - Copy that, baby. Now, as bad as you feel right now, with all that pain, that is just the pudding next to the pie. It's so easy for you to blame me. When you know the truth. You got your own men killed. - That helicopter waited for you. - I had a man down. I was saving Witney's life. You knew that! At the expense of all the other men. Those men counted on you to lead them to safety. They trusted their life to you. And you led them to slaughter. - Why don't you go check it out? - Yeah. No. Three of the security monitors just lost picture. - Then, check it out. - Yes, sir Ready for this? Langley's server just received an incoming email from SD-6. - From Jack? - No, not Jack. Dixon. Why is Dixon sending me email? He's calling the CIA for help. They forwarded this to you. "I am Marcus Dixon. Agent of SD-6." - "We are under attack. Help us."? - What's going on? - Vaughn. - Not now! - Sir, we have a situation. - Mr Vaughn. I really think you should look at this. You've had a bad day. I hope this doesn't make it worse. I know I've been suspended, but this message was routed to me. Sir, if you don't mind, may I see that? It is my province, and Vaughn is off the Bristow case. - Do we have confirmation? - Like a dead body? No. It's a fair question. - No, sir. - Any local authorities reporting? Fire, police? Any irregularities at all? Other than a desperate message begging for help? - You want to send a team? - We must do something. Like we had to do something at Denati Park? I think this is Sloane. - What? - I think he's bluffing again. By sending CIA into the SD-6 office? Sloane is bold like that. - Why is he even here? - We wait for now. - But, sir. - We wait! Is that understood? Go back and convince Devlin on your own. - No point. - You can't go by yourself. My cop friend was told by a guard the bank closed early. - Maybe it did. - I would've known. - If there has been a takeover? - If I'm not back, I may be dead. Good to know. - That's five. - Copy that, baby. Well... It's almost over. Alpha 14, standing by. I'm a Federal Officer. Step out of the car, please. No problem. Have you seen Mr Weiss? I have Mr Vaughn calling for him. I'll take the call. - Extraction Teams "R" Us. - Where's Weiss? - Probably getting pizza. - I got confirmation. - I'm at SD-6. - You're at SD-6? - Did you hear me? - That is a breach of protocol. - Screw that! - Devlin told you to wait. The break-in is confirmed. Tell Bendis to send in a team. They can get in using a card splice. - You're finished. - Just do it! Tchen, what's up? Where are we? I need status. Tell him you're still checking it out. - Tchen, where the hell are you? - Do it! Screw you. I'm disappointed. Being a reporter sucks. Can I establish that? - OK. - Hi. - Hi. And what have we been drinking? - I don't know. It had a little horse on the label. Or a dog. Like a dog-horse. A mythical creature condemned to live in a bottle for eternity. Did I mention that my life sucks? The Rileys forgive you. Seating arrangement for the wedding. God, that's so normal. Their life is so normal, Fran. Sydney's life's normal, outside of her obsession with the bank, but my life is just not normal. This story I'm working on is about a guy who's in jail. His wife committed suicide. It's just very suspicious. The guy's been totally set up. He's a good guy with no criminal record. He's got two speeding tickets in his life. He's been in jail for eight years. He's got another eight years to go. So I went to see him cos I thought I could shed some light on it. Maybe I could research and write an article that might do some justice. But... he was so scared. He had this look in his eyes. It was like... ...horror. I stopped the story. It's his life, he wants to make his own decisions. And then his kid comes to see me. - His kid? - His kid. And she begs me to help out her dad. And she was just so desperate. Then I got this key. "Pier 19, number 305"? I don't know. - What's there? - I don't know. - How'd you get it? - I don't wanna tell you. - Why? - It's very dangerous. OK. Francie, I'm serious. Well, if I were you and I thought I might be able to help somebody, I would. - Have you seen Tchen? - Not lately. I feel like a mom at the mall. I don't know if his walkie's not working... We're five numbers down. The code program's running. I'll go get him. Who is more tough-ass than you? Who? Nobody, baby! - What the hell are you doing here? - Dixon contacted us. - Dixon contacted you? - He said SD-6 was under attack. It's true. There's a team of seven. They're after something in the vault. - I took one out. - Russian accent? - Yeah. K-Directorate? - I don't think they'd do this. - Then, who? - I don't know. But right now, what do you know about deactivating C4? There's got to be 200lbs in here. Enough to level the building. It's a fail-safe. There's three. - The vault opens, they blow. - They shouldn't open it. - They being the six with guns. - When will they hack the code? Soon. Did you study bomb defusion? - Nothing field-specific. - Does anyone learn anything? Let's take this slowly. This is a charge of C4. I can tell because it says "C4" everywhere. There are eight black and yellow wires, only six red, blue and black. - Which of these 14 wires do we cut? - Maybe none. - What are those prisms? - I don't know. There may be more than one lead to the firing mechanism. - That pin. - Where? - There, in the back. - What is that? It's a crystal. That's a radio receiver. It's probably helping the vault trigger the C4. So, all we have to do is pull out the crystal? Wait. No. It can't be this easy. - There's a tamper wire? - Or a secondary trigger. Now we know what the prisms are for. Spray it again. You know, I think I can pull out the crystal without touching the lasers. - My hands are pretty steady. - So are mine. One more spray on three. - One. - Two. Three. - One down. - We'd better hurry. Inside. Over there. Tie his hands. Don't! Why don't you tie her up? - Wait. - Shut up. I'm British SIS! For the past year, I've been trying to penetrate Cole's network. - Cole? - McKenas Cole. Former SD-6. Now he works for the Third Party. There's a new player called The Man. SIS has been tying to identify The Man for the past three years. - Your tie. - My tie? If this is a success, Cole will trust me enough to tell me. - So, what's in the vault? - None of us know. But it has to do with someone named Rambaldi. If you don't let me go, Cole will send someone looking for me. He'll know someone's here and they'll find you. If you're lying, you'll make sure that happens. When they find me, I'll tell them there's only one of you. The other C4 packages are here and here. - We'll each take one. - They're behind steel wall plates. - Which you opened by yourself? - Find a fire extinguisher. Use CO2 to freeze the bolts. Go easy or you'll run out. Here. I memorised the laser grid. Your C4 is located along this corridor. Cross through engineering to electrical. It's far, so run. We'll meet in the storage room. Then we can go to that hockey game. - Maybe. Be careful. - You, too. - You took a call from Vaughn? - Yeah, now that you mention it. - A call made to me. What did he say? - It was a bad connection. - Did he confirm the attack? - He was hysterical. I wouldn't read much into it. Tchen, Toni. Does anyone copy? - Cole, this is Endo. - Endo, this has got to stop. You find Toni, you find Tchen, you find the problem and fix it! - How many were there? - One. Only one. Endo. Endo. Tchen. Somebody come in. Who the hell's shooting? Cole, Tchen's dead. Who the hell killed him? I did. Endo. Endo! Dear person, beating up my men, I assume that you're an employee here. I am now standing in Sloane's... tastefully minimalistic office. If you are not in front of me in the next 20 seconds, I am gonna start executing your friends. Starting with the man that I assume to be your partner. Mr Jack Bristow. I'm here. You're the bad-ass that's been killing my men? I don't know, I just thought you'd be an ugly guy. - Damn it. - Step in, girlie. Search her. Good and tight. Seven numbers locked, five to go. If she moves a muscle, you drill her! Roadblocks at intersections and an ambulance standing by. - You've got a call. - Not now. It's Vaughn. Line three. - Talk to me. - Where are you? - We're on our way. - This place is wired with C4. We deactivated two. Sydney was going for the third. - Can you get to it? - I don't know where it is. They've got everyone. When they open the vault, the C4 will go off. How soon is that? - Soon. Hurry. - Got it. What's going on? If you've screwed Vaughn, your ass is mine. - I'm not scared. - Yeah, well, you should start. You know, a lot of guys, it's their socks, or their piece, their gun and bullets, custom hollow tips, but for me, I have always sucked my luck from a bottle of champagne. I bring one... every job. Would you care for some? You don't remember, do you? I didn't at first either. We've met before. It was about five years ago. Here at SD-6. Which was really rare for me, cos I was a freelancer. But I was here. And I saw you in the coffee room. You were wearing pigtails and I asked you out. Now, I know I'm not the subtlest guy when it comes to women, and I probably said something insanely inappropriate, because you told me if I ever talked to you again, you'd break my kneecaps. Which just made me love you. I've thought about you these last five years, I have. Just every once in a while I think, "I wonder what happened to Pigtails." And what I took away from that encounter in the coffee room was you didn't wanna go see some mediocre romantic comedy with me, sit in my Pontiac in the parking lot, while we talked for an hour before I made my move. And you didn't wanna kiss me. - Remember? - No, I do not. But I can see not wanting to kiss you. Well, you make bad choices. Yeah, you didn't wanna kiss me, but working for a scumbutt like Sloane, that's alright by you? Let me tell you about that weasel boss of yours. He will disappoint you. And, one day, and I hope to God I'm there when that day happens, you will hate him. It was good to see you in the office again, Pigtails. I know you didn't wanna kiss me, but when I was taking the head off that bottle, I backwashed in it. I mean, like, really big time. See you. - I didn't think you'd come. - I know, me neither. I made sure I wasn't followed. I took two cabs and a bus to get here. I wore this the whole time. I look like Gabe Kaplan. - Who's that? - It doesn't matter. - You sure you still wanna do this? - You know I do. OK. - You gotta get this to your dad. - What is it? - I don't want you to look at it. - Tell me what it is. It's your mother's autopsy. There are photos you shouldn't see. - Yeah. - You understand? OK. What you said to me about going away, if your father's gonna pursue this, you have got to do that. Do you remember Griff? That big guy? Well, the MVDs, they worked him over really hard. They had straps with blades in them. These tricky glass syringes. Acid. They were really creative. But he didn't go down, not until they opened up the box. It took him about three needles then his heart gave out. How many did you take? I wanna hear you scream. Just the way... that Griff did. Scream for me. They broke you, didn't they? - They made you beg. - Don't you wish? - One number left. - "I can't take any more." - That was it. - I have more needles! - You did. - Let's go. - You cried for mercy. - I did not. - It's almost open. - Wept like a baby. - That is not what happened! - A little baby. - We have... - That is not what happened! - Come on! - Shut up! - Come on! - Shut up! Baby! I have to go to the vault. Chopper, I want you to kill 'em all. Back up over here. Up against the wall now, all of you. Lisbon. Last July. - Now! Now! - Get against the wall! Come on! You! Don't look at me like that. Get against that wall! You heard him. Get against that wall. Over there. - Can you shut off the fail-safe? - Only Sloane can. - I'll go to the vault. - I'll go, too. - You've just had surgery. - I'll meet you there. Arvin. Did you execute the fail-safe? - Yes. - We need to deactivate it. - Are they still here? - One left. - They won't get in the vault. - Sydney will stop them. - Sydney's here? - How do I shut off the fail-safe? The override is a keypad in my office, but it's biometric. It won't deactivate without my fingerprint. It'll take you hours to get my hands out of here. Marshall has a device that can duplicate fingerprints, but we haven't got the time. You could take my... fingerprint. Jack. Take my right index fingerprint. Just take it! Right index. Yes! Looking for me? Felt that one, didn't you? A kickboxer, eh? I love me kickboxers. I got your kicks and I got your moves. Bring it on. That's the problem with you kickboxers, ain't none of you can take a punch. System accessed. Yes! I think you're right. Taking a punch is something I gotta learn how to do. - What's happening downstairs? - I think everything's taken care of. We got lucky. I'll get my guys out. SD-6 will never know we were here. You should go. - You OK? - Yeah. Thanks for coming. He had this. What is that? Perfume? Whatever it is, we have it now and they don't because of you. - Not just me. - Because of you. - It had better be good perfume. - I'm not kidding. Think about what you do. Hockey can wait. I don't think what you're doing here can. Let's go. - OK. Bye. - Bye. - Are you alright? - None of us are. What happened here tonight is... This is unacceptable. The people who did this, we're gonna find them, retrieve what they've taken. Even then, this has changed everything. Sir, I got the digit right here and the medics are on their way. Thanks, Marshall. Sloane gave me the finger. - OK? - Yeah. Are you OK? I sent the email to Langley, but I guess it didn't get through. It's OK. You did a good job. This morning, before all this... you wanted to talk to Sloane. What did you tell him?
