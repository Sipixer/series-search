I was sworn to secrecy, but I couldn't keep it from my fianc√©. And when the head of SD-6 found out, he had him killed. That's when I learned the truth. SD-6 is not part of the CIA. I'd been working for the people I thought I was fighting. I went to the only place that could help me take them down. Now, I'm a double agent for the CIA. My handler is Michael Vaughn. Only one other person knows what I do. Another double agent in SD-6. Someone I hardly know. My father. - Didn't Syd say she went to Seattle? - Yeah. So? Why is there a ticket from Italy in her pocket? I came here to pass along an order from Devlin. You're going to see a counsellor for trauma evaluation. Khasinau's just converted $250m worth of assets into cash. We need to know what he spends it on. You leave for Vienna tonight. Noah? Oh, my God! Do me a favour, Syd. Tread carefully here. Until he debriefs, I wouldn't get too friendly. It's history. It was five years ago. You were the last person that I ever wanted to see again. Ever. And you were the only person that I ever wanted to see again. They found us. We gotta go. - Skyhook, this is White Rabbit. - Copy. Change of plan. Can you get us out of here 30 minutes early? Affirmative. We are being pursued. We won't make the meeting point. We need extraction now! We're locked onto your signal. Prepare for extraction. Have you in sight, turning, final approach from the south. Hostile, six o'clock. Reverse course, 180 degrees, for recovery in 10. Noah, hold on! Nine. - Drive for me. - Eight. Seven. Six. Five. - Four. - I'm pulling the cord. Three. Two. One. Hold on! The CIA has a new lead on Khasinau. K-Directorate is looking for revenge. We received Intel last night. They've hired a fairly prestigious freelance assassin to find Khasinau and dismember him. - The Snowman. Familiar with him? - The Snowman? He's been on the CIA's wanted list for 12 years. Presumed dead since '97. It seems we're not so lucky. I'm looking for contacts. Maybe we can find Khasinau by following the Snowman. I just... wanna make sure you get to Khasinau first. - I know how important it is to you. - Thank you. Hey... So the operation went alright in Arkhangelsk with Noah? Yeah. Good. - She's back tonight? - She said so on the machine. She's at San Francisco airport waiting for a plane. - So, we gonna strategise this? - Strategise? How? I wanna be gentle with her. We're accusing her of lying. I was thinking, what if she wants us to ask her? Like she wanted you to find the ticket. - Because it's a cry for help? - I don't know. Maybe. - Hey, guys. - Hi. - So, how was San Francisco? - Two days of due diligence. If I never see another financial statement, it'll be fine with me. I'm gonna crash, if you don't mind. - No. - Course not. OK. Hi. - Hi. - Hey. - You didn't say anything. - That's why I wanted to strategise. Syd, I'm not kidding. I want you to go away with me. What happened the other night, it was too soon. Russia has a huge bootleg software industry. I figured out a way of skimming money off the Russian mob. - What are you talking about? - I got a lot of money hidden away. Syd, I'm getting out. I'm sick of lying to everyone I know. The idea of just walking away from all these people that are meant to be my best friends is a relief. You tell me you never felt that way. I've got someone helping me out. I'm not kidding. I want you to come. I can't say where, but we won't need locks on the doors. - And you will learn how to surf. - You know I can't do that. - Why? - For about a million reasons. I highly doubt that. There might be 50. I'd like the opportunity to refute all of them. One of the big reasons is my mother. Khasinau was her superior. My mother was a spy for the KGB. Those files that we recovered may help me find her. I'm not going anywhere until I know where she is. What if I wait? Will you ever do it? We followed up on Agent Noah Hicks. - Is Hicks here? - Yes. He arrived 12 minutes ago. Tell McCullough I need to see him. Don't let Hicks leave. - Dad? - Sydney. You said you were gonna talk to someone. I did, thank you. I took care of it. Marshall unlocked Khasinau's computer core. Your last operation, I wouldn't have allowed it. Those computers are used for theoretical analyses, war games. The recovered files bear no relevance to his operation, his plans, or his Rambaldi artifacts. Nor do they give any hint to his whereabouts. But when I was there, I saw there were some files on Mom. I know. Also recovered on the core were some unhelpful archival files. In the case of your mother... video footage. - Was she in the video? - Yes. After the accident? They showed her alive? Yes. I have no interest in watching the video myself. Analysis is reviewing it. There's nothing to help in the hunt for Khasinau. The risk was all for nothing. Hey, Dixon. I keep trying to think of some kind of opening line, something to start off with. To talk to you. Noah, I'll be straight with you. I don't trust you. It wouldn't be a problem, except I'm an intelligence officer. If you stay, sooner or later, my life is going to be in your hands and yours in mine. And in that scenario... the only person truly safe will be you. Mr Hicks, would you come with us, please? Is there a problem? Mr Sloane asked for you to come with us. Well, that's never a good thing. Excuse me. On March 16th of this year, you opened an account with Banque Afrikana. - Yes, sir. - Explain. It was exactly like the account we were just talking about. It was opened up under an alias as part of a SVR operation. Mr McCullough, I was working undercover. I was required to do a whole bunch of things which probably seem very suspicious when viewed from the outside. $47 m was transferred, then withdrawn within 24 hours. - Yes. - To an untraceable account. - Who was the recipient? - I don't know. You don't seem real thrilled with these responses. Have you ever conducted business with the GL Bank of Austria? Yes. Please provide details. This man is hiding something. I'm curious to know what it is. Would you like me to have a word with him? My Russian or American name? - Why not both? - Irina Derevko and Laura Bristow. When were you recruited for special duties? In 1970, I was recruited to the KGB by you, Alexander Khasinau. Describe the objective of your operation. Phase One. I was to pose as an American. A student of literature. Phase Two. I was to make the acquaintance of a particular officer in the Central Intelligence Agency. To insinuate myself into his life. To become his confidante. Earn his trust. - Please state the officer by name. - Officer Jonathan Donohue Bristow. Phase Three? I was to begin to acquire, through various means, details of the CIA operation to which Bristow was assigned. Project Christmas. You have no reason to believe that anyone else was suspicious of you? - I need you to feed Donovan. - Who? My dog, Donovan. Which key is...? Where are you going? Top lock, bottom lock. I'm going to Bogota. Give him a can of the dog food and half a can of the dried stuff. - What's in Bogota? - Only half a can. - It's next to the canned stuff. - What's in Bogota. Interpol says eight years ago the Snowman attacked a guy, Kishell. - Punctured heart, lung, lost an eye. - I got it. It was bad. This guy Kishell worked with Snowman, who we know is after Khasinau. We get Kishell, we get Snowman, we get Khasinau. Exactly. Half a can. I don't want to come back to a fat dog. There were two men in Mom's video. One was Khasinau. The other one, I recognised him. It was the man from the article. The FBI agent who supposedly died in the accident with Mom. Caulder's real name is Igor Sergei Valenco. The man who was pursuing Mom. The FBI spy hunter. Dad, he was KGB. It wasn't just Mom's death they faked. It was Caulder's too. If we can get to Caulder, maybe we can find Khasinau. Assuming they still have ties. Khasinau recently liquidated over $200m in assets. On that memo were initials. ISV. Six months ago, a man matching Caulder's description was caught on camera entering a financial office in Cape Town, a known money-laundering operation. I'll suggest to Sloane we go there, seize their records and find Caulder. Noah spent years undercover there. He'll be an asset. SD-6 has run an additional profile on Noah. There were anomalies. Recent bank activity suggests he may have ties to K-Directorate. Noah's been taken into custody. What? I know what that's about. It's not to do with another agency. You have no perspective on who that man is. You're as lost now as I was. - You don't know him. - Nor do you. - That's the lesson in all this. - Dad. Noah Hicks... is not a perfect man. But he is also not a traitor. He's a loyal officer, who believes he's working for the CIA. He has no idea SD-6 would kill him if they thought he was a double agent. Please? Dad, talk to Sloane. I never actually met the Snowman. He always contacted me by telephone. His name, the Snowman, it comes from his method. He prefers an ice pick. But he uses knives too. I arranged travel across difficult borders. It was my specialty. One operation, he was ambushed, attacked. He fought off and killed eight men. He thought that I tipped someone off. That was when he came after me. He came to this house. He attacked me while I slept. Killing is his job. He likes his job. I appreciate you talking to me. I know this must be difficult. I know difficult. Talk is easy. I know the CIA has spoken to you before, years ago. But we know that an organisation has hired the Snowman for a job. I read the transcripts. Last time you said you had no leads. I hoped, this time, you might have some. You have come too far to go home with nothing. For years I was afraid to do anything. To seek revenge. But enough time has passed, Mr Vaughn. I have no more fear. Yes, I have some leads. - You'd be willing to share them? - I will contact them myself. See if I can find out where the Snowman is. What his plans are. I'd appreciate that. You must promise me one thing. That when you find him... he will suffer too. Come on, sweetheart, you're in pain. He can get you a stronger... OK. Yeah. Yeah. Just promise me that you'll call me after you talk to him. OK? Good. OK. Me, too. Bye. - I need a minute. - Yep. This is about Noah Hicks. There's something he's not telling us. He might have been turned. If you have Hicks killed, you'd be throwing away an asset. - How so? - You want Khasinau. You're closer than you think. Were you aware Caulder, FBI, was working with the KGB since 1973? Sydney's designed an operation to lead us to Caulder. We'll be one step away from Khasinau. And she wants Mr Hicks involved? This is becoming familiar, Jack. Your coming to me, requesting special consideration for the men in Sydney's life. Tippin didn't turn out to be a problem, did he? Sydney wasn't intimate with Tippin. She is with Hicks. I'm not sure that's my business. And I know it isn't yours. Sloane accepted the mission I proposed. Noah and I are going to Cape Town. Caulder's done business at a financial office there. We're gonna break into that office, get the records and hopefully find out where Caulder is. What's my counter-mission? There shouldn't be one. When you knew he was KGB, you should have told me. - Did you think I wasn't thinking? - I don't know what you thought! I was thinking about the 36 hours the FBI kept me in chains. If I'd given the information to you, you would be required to forward it to the FBI. We both know what they'd do. - Classify it. - Omega 17. We wouldn't be allowed near that investigation. I'm supposed to give you this. Tell you to write down whatever information you recover from Caulder. Stick it in the chamber, activate the beacon, bin it and we'll retrieve it. But I'm guessing you won't use it. Vaughn, I promise you Khasinau will not walk. And I won't let SD-6 get to him first. But I refuse to let the FBI get in my way again. - Nice shot. - Thanks. It's easy to shoot tranqs. No anxiety of killing somebody. The server room floor is alarmed with motion detectors. So we stay off the floor. It also has audio sensors that can detect any sound above.05 dB's. In other words... This right here, two dB's. .05 dB's is closer to the sound of a cockroach rubbing its legs together. - OK, so what do we do? - Well, active noise control. It emits an out-of-phase signal that cancels out any sound within 200ft. Check it out. That is pretty loud, right? And... The server case is alarmed. Don't touch it. You want to get a wireless modem within 3" of the server. You'll hack into the server, then download the data into your laptop. Am I boring you? You have no reason to believe anyone became suspicious of you? Of course, I would have told you. How did you acquire your Intel? Every night, for 10 years, I went through his briefcase. I eavesdropped on all of his private conversations. I planted listening devices on his clothing. He was blinded by his emotions. He knew nothing. I can tell you one thing. Jack Bristow was a fool. - Dr Barnett. - Mr Bristow. Yes. I was... I was wondering if you might have some time this afternoon. I'll make some time. - I didn't pick that play. - No, the computer picked it for you. - But I don't... Reset it. - Touchdown. - You cheated. Dude! - Score! Hey, guys. - Hey. - What's going on? Why are you looking at me like that? Did you break something of mine? No. It's... I found this in the pocket of your jacket I borrowed last week. You said you were in Seattle. You can tell us it's none of our business. But... we just care about you, that's all. - This is serious. - Yeah. OK. I've signed a dozen non-disclosure agreements, so this is between us. Of course. Six months ago my job at the bank changed. We have a handful of clients, most of them are international, who don't want their business to go through the postal service. They don't want a paper trail. So I fly to them, as the bank's representative. I'm so sorry I had to keep this from you guys. I just had no choice. Is that legal? Yeah, it's totally legit. It's just... It's a secret. - Francie thought it was an affair. - No, I didn't! - Yes, you did. - I said if you were, I would know. Well, this is all there is. So I am gonna go change, and then I'm gonna kick your ass in that game. Oh, bring it on, seriously. I am so bored playing Francie, it's... - Hey, Marshall. - Hey, Miss Bristow. Anything yet? Any word on where Caulder is? Mr Sloane didn't tell you? There was no data recovered from Noah's laptop. That server room must have had some sort of EMF generator. So, basically, when you ran out your laptop got pulsed and it erased everything. - Hey. - Hi. - You heard about the computers? - Yes. Syd, if your mom is out there, you will find her. It's gonna happen. I just feel like I'm at a dead end. How's the arm? It feels great. The lidocaine hasn't worn off. 26 stitches. New personal record. - Hello, Sydney. - Hello. I was disappointed by the news, but we'll pick up Caulder's trail. Noah, your flight to Baku leaves at six. In two weeks, you enter a doctoral programme on Petrol Geoscience at Khezar University. Inside this folder is information on dead drop procedure. See ID Services for your passport and travel visas. Good luck, Noah. Noah just got home from a five-year assignment. He's been home for two weeks. Do you think it's wise to send him under again so soon? I volunteered. Thank you. - You're not going to Baku, are you? - No. Tuvalu. It's an island in the South Pacific. I talked to my contact. He says now is my window. I'm leaving tonight. We could go together. Sometimes all I wanna do is disappear. Just let all of this go. Just... start over again. But I have my personal reasons for staying. Syd, this life is not worth it and you know it. There's too many secrets. - Too much lying to everybody... - I know. Then come with me. This is what we're gonna do. I booked you on a flight for tomorrow night. Come with me for one week to Tuvalu. Let me prove it can work. If it's about your mother, you and I can find her. We don't need the CIA for that. It'll be our last mission. And after that, we start completely new. Can you imagine that? Be on that plane and give me one week. Just one week. One week. Mr Sloane! I've been impressed with myself in the past. Now I'm freaking out. - Just tell me. - Yes. I used a signal-lost recovery procedure to examine the data sector. - I created a raw image of... - Marshall, what did you do? I found Valenco. I mean Caulder. Well, it's the same guy, right? Well, I found him. Marshall has reconstructed the data you downloaded in Cape Town. The routing information directed us to Mackay, Australia, and Bently Caulder's private residence. This one is straightforward. A daylight snatch operation. You'll lead a recovery team, grab Caulder, bring him here. The plane leaves in two hours. Dixon, could you give us a minute? Sydney, I told you I'd get you closer to your mother. I'm always here for you. You know that. Thanks. - Hello? - Hey, it's me. I am 35,000ft over the Pacific, and you just missed the most beautiful sunset I've ever seen. Hi. You're coming, right? Tell me that you are coming to meet me. - Noah. - Come on. If things were different... Any word on Caulder? No. It was great to see you... Syd, whatever you're about to say, it's not goodbye. - OK? - OK. - Alright, I'll see ya. - I'll see you, too. - OK, I believe this isn't goodbye. - Joey's Pizza? Wrong number. Devlin knows you're going to Australia. You understand he'll be expecting a full report? Yeah. I know how important is it for you to find your mom. I'll help if I can. Thanks. Any word on the Snowman? That guy I met in Bogota, I'm waiting for him to call me back. You wanna tell me what's going on? Sydney, you can talk to me. Off the record. I'm alright. Wait until I open the gate before you come in. B-team have the perimeter in case Caulder tries to run. This is Vaughn. Mr Vaughn, I have spoken to my friends. I have some information for you. - Dixon. - Are you at the junction box? No, not yet. This is weird. I don't see any guards. Weiss. The Snowman, he's been spotted in Mackay. Sydney's there. He's after Caulder to get to Khasinau. Can you think of a way to warn her? - We don't have her on comm? - No. Dixon, I just saw three guards. They're dead. Dixon! No! Caulder!
