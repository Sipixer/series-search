I was sworn to secrecy, but I couldn't keep it from my fiancé. And when the head of SD-6 found out, he had him killed. That's when I learned the truth. SD-6 is not part of the CIA. I had been working for the people I thought I was fighting. So I went to the only place that could help me take them down. Now I'm a double agent for the CIA. My handler is Michael Vaughn. Only one other person knows what I do, another double agent inside SD-6. Someone I hardly know. My father. Francie... will you marry me? Yes. Yes, Charlie, I will! You said you were working on a story about my dad, David McNeil? My dad won't talk. He's afraid of what will happen to me if he does. - Yeah. - I'm gonna go away. Now, tomorrow, whenever I know someone is fighting for my father. So, please, just help my father. I was on covert duty, penetrating Cole's intelligence network. Cole? McKenas Cole, former SD-6. Now he works for someone he calls The Man. - Is that perfume? - Whatever it is, we have it now and they don't. Because of you. - Not just me. - Because of you. This is surveillance footage from outside Tyno-Chem Engineering. Which, as you know, is the front company for FTL headquarters. You may recognise the man on the ground as Quan Li. Wait, Quan Li was assassinated? - The head of FTL? - Yes. His security detail was ambushed inside the building, leaving Li utterly defenceless. - Have you ID'd the shooter? - He's not in any of our databases. - He doesn't mind being photographed. - This man led a commando unit into FTL headquarters at precisely the same time we were attacked here. The objective was the same. To steal a Rambaldi artefact. Their agent roster was compromised and their network crumbled in hours. You're saying FTL no longer exists? Sorry, stupid question, but... ...since FTL is, sorry, was an enemy for ever, why aren't we drinking champagne? Someone was able to launch a unilateral attack on us and FTL, and we haven't got a clue who. And they now have the most significant collection of Rambaldi artefacts in the world. Maybe enough to uncover what Rambaldi was working on before us. Yeah, that does suck. It doesn't end there. Our Vladivostok assets intercepted a communiqué. A group claiming responsibility for the attacks contacted K-Directorate. They're meeting this week to discuss sharing Rambaldi technology. This man is Brandon Dahlgren. He lives year-round in a penthouse of the Regal Casino. He's a go-between for K-Directorate. He is expecting a call giving the time and location of this meeting. Information that we need. Dixon, you're on point. Sydney, you're on comms. You'll go in as Darian Buchanan, a delegate from Jamaica who's visiting Las Vegas next week. As soon as we know he's en route, you'll go in as Buchanan. You'll be flagged as a VIP, so you can gamble in the private suite where Dahlgren plays. You'll plant a bug Marshall's making to match a ring Dahlgren wears. Be prepared to leave when we hear that Buchanan's plane is in the air. Sydney, stay a minute. Is everything OK? Funny, I was about to ask you the same question. Listen, I don't mean to pry, but I had a conversation with your father, about your mother. He told you that she was KGB. I'm sorry. It's OK. I want to tell you again how much I appreciate your service to SD-6 during the incident last week. Every person here owes you their life. How's the finger? Well, I'm told it's gonna heal nicely. Thank you. Shall we? I felt sick. All those people standing there, patriots, believing they work for the US government. None of them realise the information they gather is being used by heartless men like Arvin Sloane, for an organisation that would trade them in for a profit in a heartbeat. I wanted to rip his finger right off again. - Does that make me a bad person? - No. It might've blown your cover. - You think? - Yeah. Look, you'll tag Dahlgren in Vegas. When SD-6 knows more about the meeting, we'll figure out our next move. Did the guy from your office report you? Haladki? He did. But Devlin only slapped me on the wrist, even if entering SD-6 without clearance wasn't constitutional. I hoped he'd get done for snitching, but I guess we broke even. You OK? It's nothing. Just a little bruised. Can't really tell. That's cos I'm wearing a pound of cover-up. We just heard from Jamaica. Buchanan's pilot is on standby. He could be off the ground today. Be ready to leave this afternoon. That's fine. I just have to swing by school. How's that going? School? Good. OK. Actually, since you're asking... ...l've gone from thinking Mom was a literature professor to finding out that she was KGB. I'm sure when you found that out, you must've felt as lost as I do. Last week, I was ready to leave SD-6. But maybe I was focusing on the wrong place. I think maybe I only went to grad school because Mom did. She was a teacher, so I thought it was something I wanted to do. But now I know it was just her cover, that it didn't mean anything to her... ...l'm thinking I should drop it. Dad? Yes, I'm... I understand, I just... I'm not sure I'm the best person to ask. OK. I should go. I actually had two tape recorders. You're the best. Mine just died. Great. - What is that? - What? - Is that a hickey? - No. Is it? What? Oh, my God. I have to go to a meeting. - I have cover-up. - Do you have enough? - Yeah. - This is very embarrassing. - That I saw it or that it's there? - I feel 15 years old. - The age of your intern. - I knew you'd say that. - Did Clinton teach you nothing? - I'm not married. Don't defend this. Jenny's not in your league. Who's in my league? What league? Show me the league. I'll go to the meetings and try to find those people. Where are they? - Is it good? - Yeah. What? Nothing. The next time we do breakfast with our parents, remind me mimosas are verboten. Today was the big brunch. - Didn't get along? - We wish. They're going on vacation together. - What's wrong with that? It's nice. - Nice? It's a disaster. They'll go without us and plan the whole wedding. What's in the bag? Where are you off to this time? - Vegas. - Vegas? What was I just saying? - Where shall we go? - After brunch, Vegas is too close. - I'm serious. We can go tonight. - Wait. This is not a vacation. It's a public relations conference... We don't need you to baby-sit. What I mean is, I'd wanna hang out with you guys. Wait a week. We'll all go together. Right, I guess. That breakfast blew. Tell me later. I've gotta go to school. I gotta go, too. I got a gig, on Thursday. Would you put up some flyers on campus for me? Yeah. Do I get ten per cent? Sure. I'll give you that dollar now. You wanna put some up, too? - My meeting's at a prison. - You never know. - Take care, man. - I will. I'm surprised you wanted to meet so soon. I've spent eight years in here, living in fear of what these people might do to my daughter, to Kelly. So you come in here and ask me questions about SD-6... - I just wasn't prepared. - I understand. But... Kelly came to me. She told me she'd met you, about her conversation with Robert about going away. I can't spend another eight years like this. I need to talk. Is Kelly safe? I won't do the story if not. I'm her father. Neither would I. Yeah, she's been sent away. Out of the country. Cost me nearly everything I have left... but she's safe. So who are they? What do they do? What the hell's SD-6? I'll tell you what I know. But first there's something you have to do. I'm Will Tippin. I'm here to interview Mr Glasser. You have to contact a company called O T Technologies and tell them you wanna interview their CEO, Larry Glasser. - Why would I wanna interview him? - You don't. But you gotta get into the building. See, I used to work there, and before my trial I did something illegal but really smart. I knew there were people that wanted to use my encryption software, and someone would use it for no good. So I wrote a subroutine in the program to send a tag to a dedicated server. - I don't know the technical jargon. - It's like a digital guest book. Anybody that uses the program would unknowingly sign in. I needed a trail in case I wanted to pursue the people that set me up. - A list of users of your program? - Right. On a server in the computer room at OT Tech. Once you get in the building, say you want to use the rest room. Excuse me. Where's the rest room? Three doors past the bathroom on the first floor is the computer room. The pass code is four, seven, four, seven. Once you're in, log on to the system. I'll give you all the access codes. Search for a file called Dolphin. Download it. That's the one. That's our road map. That's gonna lead us to SD-6. Your paper was unlucky to be the last one I graded. I didn't come for the paper. I've decided to leave the programme. I need your signature to drop the course. Why? I've been wearing myself too thin, with the programme and my job. You were right when you said work was getting in the way. But the fact is... ...l'm not sure I wanna be a teacher any more. Sydney... ...you're one of the best students I've ever had. That's it, that's my pep talk. But I urge you, think a little more before any final decision. - Oh, my God! - What? - I didn't know Charlie was a singer. - You know him? Yeah, unfortunately. You were in "British authors before 1800". - Yeah. - Good class. Stella Campbell. Sydney Bristow. Why unfortunately? I don't know, it was nothing. He... We went out for a few months and he was just a jerk when he ended it. - He's just a guy. - How long ago? - Just a few months ago. - A few months? - Yeah, why? - Because... He's engaged to a friend of mine. Charlie Bernard? Are you sure? - Engaged? - How long did you go out? - Just a few months. - A few months? What a pig. God, it figures. Is your friend Rachel, the blonde girl? - I thought something was going on. - No, it's someone else. Listen, you know what? I just really need to learn how to keep my mouth shut. - I'll see you around. - OK. Will, I don't know what to do. - Sure it's the same Charlie? - Yes. Francie'll be devastated. This doesn't make sense. Who the hell lives a double life like that? Seriously. - There are people. - Yeah, I guess. How am I gonna tell her? OK... Let me make a suggestion. Make sure she's sitting down and make sure she is very drunk. Yeah, you gotta get her sauced because... this is really gonna hurt. It is gonna hurt. - I'll call you later. - OK. - Can you focus? - We're trained to see details. To read people and situations, to look at clues, red flags. I started to think I was getting good. It turns out my best friend's fiancé is a cheat. Out of the blue? I guess, in retrospect, there were signs. But he could be so sweet to her. I don't have to lecture you about people's capacity to keep secrets. I'll be in touch as soon as I'm into the database. Transmitter's hot. Marshall says this is an exact copy of Dahlgren's ring. Exact would be nice. Thanks. - And good luck. - You too. Miss. This entrance is for employees only. Sorry, I just started on Friday. My mistake. I'm in. - Oh, my God! - What's wrong? You won't believe it. Francie and Charlie are here. - Did they see you? - No. Make sure they don't. - How far off are you? - Gimme two minutes. So, you want to hack into a casino? Remember how tight security was in that Siberian silo? Cakewalk compared to Vegas. Casino security is like an onion. It's layer after layer after layer. The more you peel back, the more you wanna cry. Face recognition, video surveillance. The only way in is to splice into the fibreoptic cables. But interrupting the feed alerts security. Except the one thing nobody else has but you is me. And I... ...have this. Now, this is a razor-prism. It will cut directly into a fibreoptic cable and allow you total access without interrupting the data stream. OK, Dixon, go! Sir, Mr Buchanan's arrived. - Pleasure to make your acquaintance. - Likewise. - We were expecting you tomorrow. - Yes, I know. I came ahead of the delegation to win back the money I lost last year. Though I suspect the US Senate hosts these conferences here so that we will lose our shirts. Perhaps you'll be more comfortable in our private gaming suite. How kind. Yes, thank you. Syd, we're in Vegas. What room are you in? Call my cellphone when you get this message. Where the hell are you? I'll talk to you soon. Number nine, we have a winner. We just got here! We're up a hundred bucks. Alright! Was coming to Vegas a great idea or what? Check it out. There's a wedding chapel. - Come on. - Why not? Just think about it. Just us, no parents, no hassle. You have a line of credit with us. Like to draw a downer? Yes, man. I usually start with half a million. I feel lucky today. OK. Dahlgren is at the back poker table. - May I join you? - Yeah, sure. - Good luck, sir. - Thank you. The game is five-card draw, sir. Pot limit. Minimum bet is $5,000. OK, Dahlgren's got a pair of jacks and an ace kicker. I always start off modestly. It leave me room to get out of hand. Fifty thousand. - Bets, please. - In case you're wondering, I draw an inside straight. One hundred and twenty thousand. Not my hand. Americans. Them really gullible. Good evening. Francie, what are you doing? No. Please, no. Dixon, listen, hold on the switch. Play a few more hands. Let him see your poker face. If it's OK for me to go radio silent for two minutes, clear your throat. Going radio silent. Thank you. Now, if you'll just sign the bridegroom's registry. I was just finishing my meeting across the casino and I saw you. What are you doing here? I bought the tickets anyway. No, I mean, what are you doing here? Are you guys getting married? - I know it sounds crazy. - No, I totally get it. I called you. Will you be our witness? I just need to talk to Charlie privately for two seconds. OK. - What's up? - I met a friend of yours today. - Who? - Stella Campbell. So, how's Stella doing? Does Francie know about your relationship with her? You and I are friends. I have nothing against you going into this. But you marry Francie without telling her about it and I will kill you. - Sydney... - No discussion. You don't tell her, I will. You got it? Yeah. I got it. Tell Francie I had to get back to work. I'll call her later. - Number of cards, please? - Gimme two cards, man. What the hell! I'm outta here after this. I'll take three. My friend, the night's still young. The night began $86,000 ago, my friend. - What's wrong? Where's Sydney? - Fran, we gotta talk. - Yeah? - Sir, we have a problem. We can't get married like this. - Why not? - Cos I wanna do it right, with all our friends and family there. Don't you? I'll see your ten... ...and raise 15. All the chips I have left. I see your raise, and to show I'm not a greedy man, I will raise you something personal. This, a gift from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. I've got this watch. I have a watch. But I don't have no ring. My fraternity ring? It's not worth anything. If it's worth something to you, it's worth something to me. Dixon, I'm back. Screw it, this is my last hand anyway. No, Dahlgren's got a flush. You're gonna lose. Make the switch now. Three wise men. Flush. Thanks for a good game. Something's wrong. Floor manager's coming with security. Sir, an urgent message for you. Will you step outside? Yes, of course. - Wait! What is the meaning of this? - Your attaché just called. Apparently, you're stuck in Jamaica. There are worse places to be stuck. Dixon! OK, so we're down $300. I kept hoping you'd show up and give us some luck. Thank God you didn't, cos this huge lady sits next to me, from heaven, and all of a sudden, we are on a huge streak. - How much did you win? - Two thousand dollars. Look what he bought me. Isn't it pretty? Yeah, it's really sweet. What did you say to Charlie about not getting married? - What did he tell you that I said? - He didn't. I just wanted to thank you. You know me, Miss Spontaneous. I would've regretted marrying there. It was stupid. I don't know how to say this without it being horrible, but I ran into this girl on campus... ...who said that she had an affair with Charlie two months ago. Francie, I am so sorry. What are you talking about? Who is this girl? Her name was Stella. I don't know. - You don't know her? - No, I don't. It's so like you to believe a stranger. - Wait, I like Charlie. - No, not really. - When have I said or done...? - You're not supportive at all. - I am. - You don't even know this girl. - Why make it up? - You told Charlie? - Yes. He didn't deny it. - But he didn't admit it? No, he didn't. You know, Sydney, there are a lot of things we haven't told each other lately. - Like? - I knew you didn't like Charlie when you missed looking at dresses. - That was only about work. - I'm sick of your stupid bank job! Since working there, you've been elitist and private and distant! You've let me live here, that's fine. But we were closer when I lived with Charlie, where I should've stayed. I don't even know who you are any more. And I don't want to. - That is tough. - More than tough, it was revealing. Not just about Charlie. About us. So it's more than Francie and Charlie? I don't know if she's gonna want to be my friend after that. You gave her the worst news of her life. How do you expect her to react? Yeah, I guess. - How many more hickeys you got? - Shut up. Just asking. Well, I gotta do an interview anyway. You'll be fine. I'll call you later. Know your way out? - Hello? - It's me. Your trip to Vegas was a success. - I thought you should know. - That's good. We intercepted a call to Dahlgren off the transmitter. - Linguistics is translating it now. - Anything I can do? If you have the time, I'd like you to meet me somewhere. So, why are we at a carousel? You always loved this spot. Your mother and I would bring you. I'd just been transferred to the LA field office. You were two years old. We'd watch you go round on the carousel and talk about our day, the future. And sometimes, foolishly, my work at the CIA. I never imagined that our conversations were being passed along to the KGB. I haven't been back here in 20 years. Why did you bring me here now? When you asked me the other day about school... ...I couldn't help you. I... I'm out of practice, when it comes to personal matters. Dad, I'm in no rush. Believing your mother was a professor may have influenced you somewhat, but... ...the decision to go back to school was yours. And I'd trust that. I think that... if you stick with it... ...you could become the kind of teacher students always remember. Thank you. Linguistics decoded Dahlgren's phone call, but we still know nothing of the agency or who's behind it. Learning that and getting a visual ID of The Man is our top priority. I'm tired of referring to him as The Man. - I wanna know who he is. - The meeting with K-Directorate is scheduled for 20 hours from now in Moscow. You will surveil the meeting to obtain data that leads us to The Man. This is a flash memory card. It's compatible with your fibreoptic camera. On your flight home, leave it in the plane. Seat pocket 15C. One of our agents will pick it up. 15C. Yeah. Last week, when you talked about quitting SD-6... I was naive. No, but... what you said about wanting to go to a hockey game, wanting me to be part of your life, I wasn't clear about something. That it would be nice to be in public with you, to actually get to look at you. Grab a pizza or go to a hockey game. I wasn't clear that... I would really like that, too. Good luck in Russia. - Where have you been? - Three movies. Charlie told me everything. I think everything. You were right. Sweetie, I'm so sorry. I feel so stupid... ...and I'm so sorry I said all those things to you. It's OK. You know I'm on your side, right? Thank God. - You're dropping a class? - No. No. - How's it hanging, Syd? - Very funny. We're on. Heading toward the building now. Fibreoptic camera is hot. OK, Syd, we're live. OK, going for audio. Gentlemen, welcome. I'm Mr Sark, director of operations. - On behalf of my employer... - Who is your employer? Certainly he doesn't expect us to continue referring to him as The Man? My employer's identity must remain confidential for now. This is no way to begin a negotiation. My employer sends his apologies, Comrade lvankov, and has authorised me to detail our proposal, with your approval. You seem young for such responsibility. My employer's offer is simple. We will transfer one hundred million dollars to your Cayman account, number A6112B. Sydney, that isn't a K-Directorate representative. It's Ilyich Ivankov. Head of K-Directorate. How did you know that number? In exchange, you will give us the Rambaldi manuscript you acquired and whatever analysis you made of its content. One hundred million? It's quite an opening offer. It is a final offer. The Rambaldi manuscript is priceless. It's not for sale. I am authorised to tell you that this offer expires in 60 seconds. - Is this a joke? - 55 seconds. Tell your employer if ever he wastes my time like this again, our next meeting will not be so cordial. Congratulations, Comrade Kessar. You now control the indestructible K-Directorate. You have also inherited what I hope is, by now, a very simple decision. The offer still stands. Unfortunately, you only have 20 seconds left to decide. We... We have an agreement.
