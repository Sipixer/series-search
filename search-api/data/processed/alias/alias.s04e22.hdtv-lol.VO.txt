We're at the rendezvous point. Still waiting on the DSR team. We'll give them five more minutes, then move on. Have we made any progress with the russians? No, director Chase is in Washington. They've organized a coalition to pressure the russians to call off the air strike, but so far, no luck. They do understand that destroying the device with conventional explosives will cause enough toxic fallout to make Chernobyl look like a kitchen fire? Yeah, their official position is they're not buying it, which gives you about two hours to deactivate the device. Dad, we got a signal from the DSR team's transponder. They're a block and a half away. We'll be in touch. The russians rely on the Milsat satellite network to vector the bombs, right? If I can hack into it, I can shut it down. And violate several thousand international laws? We're talking about the end of the world. I'm not worried about a tribunal. That's a good point. Go, go, go, go. - It's operational. - Have you notified our cells? - We're on schedule. - Good. It won't be long before you see her again. I know Nadia. She's gonna make us proud. The signal's coming from right here. We should keep moving. Show yourself! Brodien. Bristow? Oh, for god's sakes. What are you -- I thought you were relieved of duty. Well, don't believe everything you hear. What happened here? Uh, let's just say those tranqs -- they're not gonna do you any good. Not on the infected. They're like rabid dogs. They travel in packs. It only took one night to wipe out my entire team. You're the last one alive? Yeah. That's right. I don't know how many are out there -- hundreds could be thousands. What about the rest? Where are they? Dead, if we're lucky. When there's no one left to kill, they turn on each other. The municipal water supply was tainted. And the device is broadcasting a subaudible frequency off any spectrum. Anyone within the radius of the signal who drank the water has been physiologically altered. Are we gonna just shoot them? Yes. I mean, it's either them or us. They're already gone anyway. We're putting them out of their misery. There is no cure. Once you're infected, there's no reversing the symptoms. What have you learned about the device? Uh... best we can tell, the epicenter is, uh, 4 miles northwest over the Oransky building -- right here. In that case, the control center for the device should be located on the rooftop. I've taken out the city's power grid. The device keeps running. Irina knows how to bring it down safely. Irina? Irina Derevko? The device has been modified to run off an internal energy source. We need to get to the roof of that building. Okay, uh, right, but we can't drive. All the roads are closed off with gridlock. We can get through town through the subway tunnels. It's a straight shot to the Oransky building. There should be an emergency battery system to power up the cars. Those tunnels are pitch black. There's only one way in or out. I'm not saying I'm looking forward to it. All right. Let's go. They're here. Less than two hours before the russians launch their strike. Nothing can stop us. Regardless, we should eliminate all possibility. I'll lead the assault team. Nadia. What about Nadia? Bring her back. Give her the option to join us. I was going to. Let's go. Damn it. It's too secure. I can't get in from the outside. Unless we have a valid access code, this isn't gonna work. So get an access code. Only russian military officials have access codes to those. Hence the word access. We've managed harder. Come on. There's got to be a way. What would Jack do in this situation? Jack is the king of this sort of thing. Well, first he'd probably glower a bit, right? And then he'd probably blackmail or torture somebody. Right? You're  a genius. You, Eric Weiss, are a genius. I thought Sloane turned the Blackwell Index over to Langley. He didn't. It's complicated. Not really. Sloane's evil -- why wouldn't he hold on to blackmail material on world leaders? Okay, here it is. Russian deputy defense minister Karkov. We find the right dirt, he'll be begging to give us the code. I think we found your passion. - What's this guy into? - Let's take a look. -  Ooh. Is that A... - Whoa, hello. - I hope not. - Wow. Jack, we found a russian minister off the Blackwell Index who can get us access to the Milsat. We'll ke you posted. Copy that. Marshall and Weiss are working on the russians. Stubborn bunch, your countrymen. We like to control our own fate. You never put much faith in that, did you? Fate. Destiny. About as much faith as I put in horoscopes, fortune cookies. Look. Rambaldi wrote, "when bloodred horses run to the streets and angels from the sky, the chosen one and the passenger will clash." "And only one of them will survive." You really are through the looking glass, aren't you? When I see angels fall from the sky, I'll start to worry. I just can't shake the feeling that tonight, one of my daughters will perish. This is it. Hey, Brodien, it looks like that ear healed up pretty nicely. Yeah. And if you plan on putting any more holes in me, just go ahead and tell me now. All right? Brodien? Hang in there. Go. End this. We should move. Now! We found the switching room. We'll set green lights all the way down the line. It should only take me a few minutes to redirect the power to the drive wheels. How are we on the brakes? The calipers have seized. Must have happened when the power shut down. But if we cut the hydraulic lines and bleed the fluid, they should disengage, but we'll have no manual stopping power. We can set the track switch at the Oransky station to trigger an emergency stop. Right. Be careful out there. You shouldn't wait. For what? I saw the ring. Yeah, you know what? You killed my father. The way I see it, I don't have to ask for your blessings. Despite that, you may have them. Along with some advice. Marital advice from you. Wonderful. Like what, don't betray your spouse? Yeah, that'd be one of them. But even between a husband and a wife, some secrets are acceptable. However, your activities are not. What are you talking about? You're not as covert as you'd like to think. Consider my life an object lesson. If you don't want tond up like Jack and me, tell Sydney the truth. It's not catching. They're at either end of the platform. Maybe when the train's at the station, they have to be set manually -- we can do it ourselves. Okay. You still feeling it, too? Like something awful's gonna happen. I know. Vaughn asked me to marry him. Sydney... that's amazing. I'm sure there are plenty of brides who want to kill their maid of honor. I'm not one of them. Okay. I'll take the switch in front. Whatever! I wrote this program in five minutes, you perv! I'm gonna make this real simple for you. We need your Milsat access codes. You either give it to us now, or every major news organization will get the tuva photos by morning. "A," I don't know what you're talking about. "B," I'm running a trace on this call. Great. I look forward to meeting you. While I've got you on the line, let me ask you -- what's the significance of the green balloons? Alpha-5-7-2-8-1-1-black. Now, let me be clear. If those photos ever -- Oh, sure thing, minister. Or should I call you "cowboy"? Got it! D a. - Okay, code's good. We're in. - Good. Okay. - Wait a second. This is odd. - What? What's odd? Well, there's a signal coming out of Sovogda. Someone's trying to uplink an encrypted broadcast connect to the russians' network. It could be Elena, but why would she broadcast over a closed network? - I don't know. - Can you find out? Let me see. Jack, we cut the brake lines. As soon as you restore power, we'll be good to roll. I'm almost done here. Give me a sec. Need any help? No, just another minute. Where's Nadia? - She isn't back yet? - No. Guys, they're coming! - Nadia, get out of there! - Got it! Nadia! Vaughn! Nadia! Nadia! Dad, stop the train! Sydney, we can't! Stop the damn train! Nadia! Sydney! Come here, come here! No! Syd... Your sister's alive. Hold on! We're coming into the station! These are Elena's men, sent here to kill you. I suppose you're expecting a thank-you. There's no time for sarcasm, Jack. Elena's men have already primed the world's drinking water. No one else can stop her if we don't get to her within the next few hours. Wait a minute. You expect us  believe that you came here to help us? Please! I have never been disingenuous with you on this, Sydney. I allied myself to Elena in order to put an end to her plan, to shoulder the risk myself. But she's built in security devices, and I haven't had enough time. I've heard quite enough, Arvin. Jack, I've been inside the operation. If you want to stop Elena, this is how we're gonna do it. She's secured herself inside an antiquated C.O.G. facility below the Oransky building. Sydney, Vaughn, open a line to A.P.O. We're gonna need Marshall. Jack, you take point. Irina, forgive me, but there's no time for pleasantries. You're no longer in charge of this team. Jack, we might have made a breakthrough. Marshall detected a signal coming out of the city. We believe Elena is trying to uplink to the Milsat network. Do we know why? I decoded the signal -- it's a subaudible frequency below the range of human hearing, the same frequency being used by the Mueller device. She's using the russian satellite network to distribute that frequency worldwide. If she succeeds, the effects we're seeing will occur globally, everywhere the water's been primed. That's her endgame. I know we told you there were two hours before the air strike, but the instant the russians scramble those bombers, the satellite network, it's going to go online. The minute that happens, that signal -- it's going to be broadcast. She is super-tricky -- counting on the russian air strike all along. It's what she wants. How much time do we have? 40 minutes, give or take. We need to get to the roof of that building and shut down the device. Can you send us intel on the facility -- thermal scans? Okay, just give me a sec. No good. The Mueller device is causing too much interference. The best I can do is building blueprints. Uploading now. Got it. Put in a call to Chase --  Washington should be kept up to speed so they can order foreign leadership to begin preparations. - Good luck. - Yeah, likewise. Our best bet is the northwest entrance. We can approach it through the alley without being seen. If she anticipated that, all her defenses would be there. You're going to help us get inside that building and up to the roof. - We have 40 minutes. - Of course. If we fail, I will personally put a bullet through your skull. You won't have to. I can take you up to the roof. It's not a problem -- Elena left it unguarded. Once you disable the device, the toxins that are inside will dissipate into the atmosphere. What you're talking about is a suicide mission. Just get me to the roof. I can cut the wire to the relay -- reverse the ionization. Aside from the impact, the water will be harmless. I'll take you, but your sister changed the wiring scheme. It's one of her fail-safes. In that case... take me to my sister. I will. Where's Nadia? Phoenix, Raaptor, do you copy? Can anybody hear me? Sydney! Hello? Is someone there? Help  me! Please. Don't hurt me! What happened to you? My leg -- I think it's broken. Thank god. I've been here for hours. It was risky going out like you did. How did you know I wasn't one of them? Because... ...I know who you are. Sweetheart. I'm sorry it had to be done this way. I hope you understand. I never wanted to hurt you. I never wanted children of my own, Nadia. Then you came along. And ever since then, no matter how far I was from you, I always thought of you as my daughter. Don't touch me. You have a choice. You can embrace your anger and hate me... ...or you can join me. The flood has begun. Only precious few will survive. There she is. I see her now -- your mother. She used to look at me with those eyes. It's time that you accept the life you have ahead of you. I know it's not easy. Greatness never is. You're right. I see my future. Two minutes from now, I see myself killing you. The only reason you want me to be on your side is because you believe I'm the one to stop Sydney Bristow. But she's my sister. You're nothing to me. I am sorry you feel that way. What's that? Don't worry, darling. It's only tap water. I will never betray my sister. We'll see. Syd. Did I forget something? Yeah -- me. I'm coming with you. Did my dad change the plans? No, I did. I'm joining you on the roof. It's a one-person job. My mom will relay up the wiring instructions. - I can disarm the device myself. - I know you can. But you can't outrun the wall of water that thing's gonna turn into. How are you gonna help me? We'll figure something out. You'll run faster if I'm chasing you. I'll be fine. And they need you in the bunker. - Syd... - If we don't get Elena... Don't say it. I'll see you in a few minutes. Okay. Just in case, yes. - Yeah? - Yeah, I want to marry you. It's perfect. So are you. Go. - I'll see you. - I know. That's right, a polymorphic computer virus capable of infecting military-grade encryption. You think you can handle that? Not 10 minutes -- I need it now! Just get it done, okay? Thank you. Are we close? That's not really a helpful question right now, okay? Don't blame yourself. This satellite network was designed to withstand World War III. I just got off the phone with my buddy at the secret service. They've initiated the "continuity of government" protocol. The president, his cabinet, their family members -- all being evacuated to underground command centers. Somewhere in the back of my mind I've kidded myself, but I thought maybe I'd be on the list. Yeah. It's kind of like high school all over again. The cool kids are having a party, and I'm not invited. All right, there's still time left. Let's not give up on them yet. Hey, honey. Hi. Uh... no, I don't have a lot of time. I just -- I just wanted to tell you I love you. I don't get to tell you that often enough. No, I haven't been drinking. I'm just -- I'm just gonna be home early tonight, okay? Bye. Russian bombers are taxiing to the runway. Have you uploaded the signal? Once Milsat in on line, the signal will be broadcast worldwide. Sloane's back. Hello, sis. Ever since you were 11, there's something I wanted to do. You -- Now. Can't retract the signal from this terminal. Find the relay room and destroy it. Nadia! Nadia, it's me. It's Sydney. I don't want to hurt you. Sydney, what's happening? It's Nadia -- she's guarding the device. She's infected. This is all your doing. You have to take her out. No, dad. She's my sister. Listen to me. She's not your sister anymore. But mom... I know. Please, Nadia. Please let me help you. - Sydney? - Sydney, what's happening? Nadia, stop. The relay's blown. Check the signal strength. No good, Vaughn. The signal's still broadcasting. I've planned this for five years. Don't you think I've accounted for every possibility? - Vaughn? Is Sloane with you? - No. He's not with you? - Get to the roof right now. - On my way. Okay, mom, I've removed the panel. Do you see the master circuit board? I see a lot of circuit boards. It's the one closest to the power supply. Trace the ground wire. It should lead you to the coil. Got it. Okay, I'm there. There should be two wires -- one black, one yellow. No. She's changed them out. One wire's blue. The other's white. Hold on, Sydney. I'll give you one chance to do the right thing. Not that you were ever any good at that. Which wire? It's useless. In a few minutes, when the signal broadcasts, the whole world will be different. However you plan on torturing me, I'll hold out at least for that long. I'm not gonna torture you. I'm gonna let him do it. And he really doesn't care for you, especially after you tricked him into killing me. One thing you should know about Jack -- he hates being anybody's puppet. I'm actually hoping you don't tell us what we need to know. There's a 50/50 chance Sydney cuts the right wire. I'm willing to take those odds... if it means I can stand here and watch you turn into an animal. You're not a gambling man, Jack. I didn't used to be, but it's been a rather interesting year for me. It's made me re-evaluate certain parts of my life. I'm trying to have more fun these days. Wait. How do I know you won't inject me anyway? You don't. White. Tell her to cut the white wire. Sydney, cut the blue wire. And then run like hell. You have 15 seconds before the ball bursts. Copy that. Cutting the blue wire. Nadi-- Nadia. I had no choice. Sydney, we got to go. Get her into the elevator. She's still breathing. Sydney, let's go. She's bleeding out. Put some pressure on it. The device is coming apart. Raptor, do you copy? Come on. Phoenix. Raptor, Phoenix, do you copy? Come on. Anyone? Hold on. I'll try an alternate signal. - Anything? - Nothing. All right, what's the status of the building? It's not there anymore. 3-9-alpha-2-4. We've transitioned out of the bunker on the street. Requesting immediate evac. Med-support needed. Popping smoke now. The chopper should be here any minute. We both know how this is supposed to play out. You bring me back to the states, turn me over to your superiors. On foot, you could reach the border by daybreak. What about the agency? What would you tell them? Oh, I think they know -- no one can hold on to Irina Derevko for too long. Take care of your sister. I will. Three years ago, when I told you you were the chosen one, that only you could take down the greatest evil, I know your mind must have been overwhelmed with confusion. But tonight you should recognize that you've done just that. I'm so proud of you. Thank you. Sydney? You may not see me on your wedding day... but I'll see you. - Nadia. Is she -- - Her vitals are stable. They're keeping her under sedation until we find an antidote for her condition. What about the survivors? Russians must be running tests -- There aren't any survivors. The russian military executed all remaining civilians inside Sovogda. Of course. Otherwise it would belie their claim of a chemical explosion. It's because of me... because of my choices. I've hurt the most precious thing in my life. We'll get her back. Whatever it takes, we'll find a cure. Thank you. I've arranged for you to see Nadia. Sydney. I didn't think I would ever say this, but I believe you were trying to do the right thing. Thank you. - I had a thought. - Yeah? What if we just blow off the big-wedding thing? What if we just do it on the beach? - The beach? - What do you think? I like it. Barefoot on the beach, you'd look sexy as hell. Oh, but wait. What about your dad? He doesn't look like the kind who likes sand between his toes. That's true. So...we won't invite him. Your father? What if we don't invite anyone? We just elope? Are you serious? I would love it. All right. Then we'll elope. Have I told you that I love you? Yeah. Go ahead, tell me again. I love you. I love you, too. I know. Say it again. I love you, Syd. That's why I need to tell you something. Just so there's no secrets between us. Okay. Whatever it is, I can handle it. Just don't tell me you're a bad guy. You're not a bad guy, are you? I guess that depends who you ask. Vaughn... It's from a long time ago. It's before we met. Actually, it's the reason we met. It's no accident that I was the one you came to when you walked in the CIA with your story about SD-6. Wait. I don't understand. Vaughn, what are you telling me?
