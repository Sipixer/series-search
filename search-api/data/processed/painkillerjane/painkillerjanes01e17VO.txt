Parking meter trick didn't slow them down enough, I gotta find something else to change. The traffic signal for this light is 75 seconds. Why does the damn thing change for them at 14. How can they control the traffic signals? Unless they're feds. You have no idea how you lost the button. It's a button, darlin'. If it means that much to you, you can come over tonight and sew on another one. We got a problem guys. What've you got? Someone just hacked into the dmv system. Ran a plate on one of our vehicles. Think dyle's onto us? How would he know how to find us? Riley, which plate did they run? The black tahoe. I think it is dyle. Is that woman's intuition? Humor me. Right. So what's the deal with riley? How'd he get wet? The truck hit a puddle. Zhang's motorcade's approaching exit 41... Eta to building, 2 minutes, 55 seconds. Hit it. Run it!! Watch out!!!

Zhang's 20 seconds from the intersection. Got a lead on our neuro. Come on! Got a lead on our neuro. Damn!! We have a briefing at 7:00 call connor and riley. You're gonna be damn sorry lady that you ever came along for this ride. ...With a high today expected to be in the low 70's. As for the rest of the week, expect a chance of rain on saturday. All right it's 6:30 a.M. And time for the traffic report. Light for a thursday but expect some congestion downtown due to the arrival of visiting chinese minister of foreign affairs... 6:30 a.M? Thursday? I don't understand. It's not the first time you've lived this day. Keep your mouth shut. I've got to take this call. Hello? Is everything set for today, phillip? Mother, please. The job will get done. I told you not to worry. You know how important this is. Something's come up I need to take care of. I've got it under control. Try and have some faith in me. Then I'll see you tonight... To celebrate our victory. I'll be there for dinner. You always listen to your mother? Shut up. Andr√©...which one's andre? The older guy or the muscle? Vasco, where the hell are you? Who's andre? Boss I'll take it. No. I'll take it. No. You have your choice... Him... ...or me? I gotta take it. Connor. Got a lead on our neuro. Briefing at 7:00. Any idea where vasco is? No. No! No!! Connor!! No! No!! Call riley. Copy that. I got to go. So if the day is completely replayed... How come I rember everything that happened? Because you were holding on to me when I re-racked. No one else will recall living this day, including your little commando team. That explains connor's button. How far back can you go? The beginning of the current day. Once a day's over, it's over. I'm not god. Just close. My turn. Who are you people? Why are you trying to kill zhang quan? Answering a question with a question. Guess you're going to die never knowing. Hey it's okay. Straight to voice mail. Vasco, if nothing's wrong with you, I'm gonna kill you myself. What happened to you? Take to long to explain. I know what dyle's power is. He can re-rack time. Replay the same day over and over. That's a pretty wild theory. You called the briefing to tell us that dyle rented a downtown office on the route of the chinese foreign minister, zhang quan. You couldn't know that. Unless you already told me. Which you did. The last time we started this day. Joe's going to short out a wire and the light's going to blow. Damn! I'm alright. Guess I should've thrown the circuit breaker. How did you... In two seconds, riley's going to enter soaking wet. Didn't you get splashed by a truck? No, but this girl I just met did. Close enough. How'd you know that? The last time we lived this day I called riley. This time, I didn't get your call about the briefing somebody else must've called him. Yeah, I did. Everything's just a little off. Sorry I'm late. Connor, hold up your right arm. You got a button missing on your cuff. Yeah, I just noticed. The neuro can restart the day. As many times as he needs to. We don't remember anything, what's different? How do you know all this. What're you talking about? Long story. And we've got to get downtown. Dyle's going to try again. Connor. What the heck is going on? You're asking me. Be careful... The whole intersection is going to erupt in flames. If you say so. Run it!! Flames, huh? Dyle must've changed something. Riley, zhang's eta? Two minutes. I've got a satellite thermal image of someone in the rented office. He's cut power to the elevator. Stairwell's the only way up but it's booby-trapped. I'll take the lead. Zhang's eta to intersection, 20 seconds. That jack-ass stole my vespa. Where is he? I don't know. Untie me!! Shut up. Point blank. Zhang never had a chance. Yeah. Gotcha. One of the networks acquired cell phone footage of the assassination taken by a civilian. They just ran it. Unfortunately, we got to watch it live. Great. Everyone's gonna see our screw-up over and over again, all day long. Homeland security elevated the threat level to orange. Dod's put the military on alert, world-wide. Even if we hunt this guy down and chip him, it won't lessen the political cris. The info I gave you on dyle's apartment lead to anything? Yep. The place was rented last week, under an alias. I ran a search and came up with a cell phone, activated the same day, same address. Can you track the cell phone? When were you gonna tell us? Gimme a break, it just popped up on the grid as you were walking in. He's still in town. Ten blocks away from where the hit took place. Let's go get him. Should I notify the fbi and metro police? No. No, nobody should do anything, until we think this through. If vasco is right. And we're reliving this day over and over, we get near dyle and try and chip him, all he's going to do is rewind the day. And we start from scratch. But if dyle rewinds the day, doesn't that mean that zhang will be alive? Again? Riley, you're a genius! We knew that. We can work this. Is someone gonna clue me in here? Right now dyle thinks I'm dead. Why does he think you're dead? Because he unloaded his gun into me. According to riley, he hasn't gone back to his apartment. Which means he still thinks I'm there. I'm lost. If we can force dyle to replay the day, I can nail him. He's already hit his target. He has no reason to replay the day. Let's give him one. Dyle's at his apartment now. How did you get this number? Your mother gave it to me. Mother..? Who are you people? What do you want? Revenge. Say goodbye to "mother." do what you have to, phillip! Don't let them stop you! Nooo!!! Vasco better be right about this. They don't understand... I can bring mother back. Jump into the morning and... They don't understand... I can bring mother back. jane? before he works on the wiring. Got a lead on our neuro. Briefing at 7:00 call connor and riley. No need to. What? Seth got a neuro-positive test on dyle. Riley found out he rented a downtown office. You think he's going to assassinate the chinese foreign minister. It's not going to happen. How would you know that? I just chipped him. Where are you? Dyle's apartment. I'll explain when you get here. And tell joe to be careful. He should throw the circuit breaker before he works on the wiring Damn! Some neuros exploit their powers in a negative way, but the ability to do things over, keep trying until you get it right, can be used in a positive way. What's so funny. How's a guy like riley get anywhere with a babe like that? Persistence.
