ma lost the money, and now we're here in a dead guy's house. What kind of monster steals the family bank? We're gonna get caught, Di. How'd y'all get in the front gate? We live here. Hi, Doug Rich. Welcome to Panco, Doug. I hope your time here is fruitful. Dahlia, what are you doing here? Hugh offered me a job. I'm gonna take him up on it. How do you do? I'm mrs. Doug Rich. Just bring back the money, Di. Dale wants $40,000. That's a lot of silverware, dad. Goddamn small bills. Isn't this what got us in trouble in the first place? How long are we gonna stay? We get in, we get out. I want an oath of protection. The car's right outside. Come on. Let's go. Dad, these people have been staring at us. No, honey. It's just your imagination. Hey, take your coat. Why can't we just park the rv at our house? They won't let it through the gate, buddy. It's too ugly. It's our home. Not anymore. This is a bad idea. What do you mean? Rvs there, there, there, over there. We're gonna blend right in. They're gonna break in the minute we leave. Maybe they're nice. Or maybe they're just like us. - We got history. We got culture. - Good morning. Community. You mean, we used to, right? No, sweetheart. We got it whether we're with travelers or not. I said hey. What are you, deaf? No, I'm not deaf, but I sometimes get a buzzing in my ears. Does that count? What she's trying to say is there's a fee. Oh, Jesus Christ, I knew it. You know what? You ain't got no right chargin' me no fee, buddy boy. True. We have no right, but it's 200 bucks. That'll cover the first week. We'll keep an eye on it for you guys. Don't you pay 'em, Wayne. Completely reasonable. Oh, my God. Thanks. You have nothin' to worry about. Come on. We got to get back to work. Screw work. We've been gone two days. Yeah, let's not mention the other little thing. What, you mean the money we stole? Jesus, sam, he just said not to mention it. Stay calm, baby. Well, what's wrong, Kimmie? Hugh's gone crazy. He's crazy. He thinks someone robbed him, stole $40,000 from his safe. He's not letting anyone leave until he finds who it was. Your name? What's your real name, Tony? It's Tony. It is. Shit. Where the hell have you been? ~SeriesSub~ present Transcript: swsub.com Synchro: Hutch Synchro: Golgi Season 01 - Episode 08 X Spots the Mark Been gone two days, same as the money. What money? The 40 grand in my safe. Ring a bell? You saying you suspect us? I suspect everybody who works for me, everybody who had access to Panco on the day of the crime. Hugh, as your counsel, I must warn you that forcing your employees to undertake a lie detector test is completely illegal. Potential liability is enormous. It's scientifically useless. Am I right? Where the hell have you been for the last two days? Food poisoning. Bullshit. No, it's true. He had a bad shrimp. You're the head of legal, Doug. You don't disappear 'cause you ate a bad shrimp. Now, you're gonna tell me where you were, and you're gonna tell me the truth. I'm gonna get it out of you one way or another. Reynaldo, you can go. - Whatever the hell your name is. - He's not done. He's done. You, too, Cherien. No, I'm stayin'. Get the hell out. Okay, Doug, you're on the hot seat. I was in florida, in Boca Raton, working on a new investor for you. An investor. A big one, one to help you with your current cash flow situation. So who took the money? I don't frigging know. Why didn't you just tell me you had an investor, Doug? Because I was trying to keep it quiet because it was supposed to be your end-of-the-quarter surprise. Who is he? Well, that was part of the surprise. It is a very delicate personal relationship, and the deal is not quite closed yet. Excuse me. Well, you better close that deal, Doug. You better close it. How much you got him on the line for? What's he in for? A hundred grand? Two? Three hundred? Four? 500,000? I had no choice. You signed us up for $500,000? What was I supposed to do? I hate those machines. They creep me out. What, you think it's gonna steal your soul? People pass polygraphs all the goddamn time. Who? What people? In the movies. He would've had me at "Doug Rich." My God. Where are we gonna find half a million dollars? I said I will find an investor. I will just have to find that investor. What? To invest in this shithole? Honey, we are con men, remember? We do fake investors. We don't do real investors. Where are you gonna find a boca man? All right team. Listen up. We're thinkin' of doing a big store with Panco as the front. So we need to find a mark that's rich, greedy, and stupid enough to wanna drop a load without thinking twice. What about Jim and Nina? Don't they have a lot of money from alpacas? Cupcake, I love Nina. Guys, I got one. Averil Utrell, age 79. She's a recent widow. Her husband was some Rich oil guy, and it turns out she's giving all her money to animal shelters and music stuff. No, we don't do little old ladies. Di, did you burn your moral compass? Look, why don't we just try pullin' a rag on an apple down by the train station? That's a good idea but we don't know shit about the store market, do we? Next? Come on, family. Lots of easy marks around. Yeah, except they can't know us, they can't be too smart, and they gotta be greedy as shit. You're makin' it difficult. Rudy Blue. Perfect. - The baseball player? - Yeah. He loaded. Ain't he still in jail? Not anymore. Okay, Rudy Blue is quite possibly the coolest guy in the world. Speak up, Cal. I can't hear you. He's the most badass baseball player of all time. He had sex with a hooker girl during of the seventh inning stretch a world series game. When baseball was baseball. And he got busted havin' sex with a 17-year-old girl. Okay, he says they were just friends. Her dad found them naked in a hot tub. Okay, he's got a shitload of cash, right? First day out of the big house, he bought a Ferrari 612 scaglietti. 250 gs. That's a man with somethin' to prove. And money to lose. He invested in shrimp boats, bana farms, and Rudy's chili and fries. A guaranteed loser. Hi, I'm rudy, and, I'm a sexaholic. Hi, Rudy. Okay, and we have newcomers. Please introduce yourself. First names only. Hi. I'm Mel, and I'm a... sexaholic. Hi, Mel. Thank you, Mel. And, would you like to introduce yourself? Hi. My name's Cherien. And I... I'm just so goddamn horny. Hi, y'all. Hi, Cherien. All right, settle down now. Settle down. So there I was in the cockpit, workin' my magic. Wait a minute, you gave a handjob to a pilot while he was on duty? It's not like no one else was flying the plane 'cause, you know, the co-pilot was there, too. Luckily, I'm ambidextrous. I guess that makes you a member of the mile-high club. Look who's talking, mr. "I like 'em young." Come on. Don't remind me of that fact. Come on, Rudy. You don't have to be ashamed. Everybody still loves you. They don't. Not after that girl, they don't. That little slut? Whole world knows she set you up. My ex-wife has everyone convinced that I'm just a dumbass, horny loser. A horny loser? You're a baseball legend. You are. Yeah, I guess. I... Who do you think built Rudy's chili and fries? That was my idea, my hard work, my business savvy, and that damn judge, he just gave her everything. Well, it's your name on the sign. - He gave her that, too. - They did? My own name. She took everything. Well, you still got your health... And your money, right? Yeah, I still got that. But my family, my teammates, my self-respect... &I respect you. - Shit. - What? Is there a problem? It's my ex, makin' my life miserable. Do you have kids? Just Sammy, who that bastard is trying to take away. Posey did the same thing to me. You got to fight him, Cherien. Fight him. Yeah. Everybody's saying, you know, he's so smart, and he's making money hand over fist. He fights me on every penny. I mean, he's doing a huge deal right now that I happen to know is going to make him even richer than he already is, and he still wants to cut my alimony. What does this guy do anyway? Real estate developer. We got married real young. No, he couldn't deal with my problem. I mean, can I help it if my needs are more than he can handle? Because I... Controlling my lust... Is a daily... Hourly struggle. I mean, temptation is everywhere. I'm sorry. I'm just finding this whole abstinence thing very, very challenging. Cherien, I... I understand. Me, too. Guess I better call a cab. Got to go pick up the kid from the dickhead. Well, I can give you a ride. Really? I mean, you think it's safe for us 'cause I don't want to do nothin' to trip us up. We're both in the program, Cherien. I just want to be your friend. There's still so much to discuss. Sammy falls asleep real easy. I love kids. Let's go. Sam, mama's home! I'm here to pick you up! Hello to you, too. Who's your friend? None of your damn business. Hey, mom, I missed you. Sam... antha, hi. So this is my little girl. And you better go get your stuff, honey, cause nice mr. Blue's gonna give us a ride home. Hey, I know you. You're Rudy Blue. You used to play for the Cubs. And the A's and Royals and Rangers... And the Mariners and the Angels and the Braves. My God. I am a huge fan. Sammy and I, we order Rudy's chili and fries probably three times a week. Great, great. Thanks. Rudy Blue in my own house with my ex-wife. Don't you listen to him, Rudy. He's just tryin' to kiss your ass. Where's my video? You better find it because I'm gonna burn this place down. Instead of subjecting our guest to your insanity, perhaps we should deal with our problems in private. - Will you wait for me? - Sure. I'll just be a little bitty minute. So sorry about this. Help yourself to a drink. Drinks in the kitchen. Mi casa su casa. Great. Thanks. You lost our Hawaii video? What do you care? I'm naked in it! What do you think? You afraid I'm gonna put it on the internet? Who would want to see you naked? Screw you! You'd do it just to piss me off! Fine. Take it. You have it? I don't want it anyway. Just stop blogging about my sex drive. Jesus Christ. Are you really a baseball player? Yeah. Well, I used to be. My daddy is gonna buy a baseball team. He is, huh? Well, you know, baseball teams cost an awful lot of money. I know. Once his new deal closes, he's gonna be richer than God. It's a secret, though. I can't even tell mom. Hey, free country. I can write whatever i want. Enough Cherien. One more stunt like that, I'll sue your ass. I am so sorry, Rudy, but Doug and I still have a few things to fight about like cats and dogs. It may take a while. Can I call you in the morning? Thank you so much. So what do you guys think? Is he a gut guy or a research guy? Gut guy. You, guys, if he does even a little bit of research on Doug Rich... - He's gonna... - He's gonna find Doug Rich, a respectable lawyer, working for a respectable real estate firm. I don't understand why we can't just call the guy. No, baby, you never, ever call the mark. He's gotta call us. We can't call him. Gotta set the bait. See, if he takes it, then calls, he's the right guy, and if he doesn't... Then he's the wrong guy. Never was the right guy. And I think he's gonna call. I think Rudy's the man. You know... Eat that. Listen, he's just out of jail. The man's got a lot to prove to people that he's still worth something. Yeah, and as much as he wants into mom's pants, I think he wants in on this gig a little bit more. I don't know, dad. It's a long shot. We need children of little faith. - Could be. - No way. Come on. Come on. I can do lunch. No. Yeah, I know it. I will meet you there. I'll meet you there for lunch. All right, I stand corrected. My boobies are gettin' credit for this one, I'm telling you. You're pretty sly, Rudy, snagging one of my business cards. Well, I just thought we had a few things in common. Seems you know baseball, you know... I don't know how to tell you this, slugger, but she is a nut case. Well, she seemed pretty sweet to me. If she wants you to do something, you do it, then she'll turn around, she'll bite your head off, you know? The sex... Sex was dangerous. Really? Different positions. She loved to try out many different positions, and she's... She's doubled-jointed, and I'm not, So it was a challenge. I shouldn't be talking about this. But aside from the sex, you know, everything else was a catastrophe. I mean, she lies like a rug, she spends like sailor. God, I know exactly what you mean. My ex-wife, she takes so much money from me. I can't even live off the interest anymore. Must have been making the wrong investments, my friend. Is that why you asked me to lunch? Well, you know, I heard you had something going. You're into real estate, right? I love the land, Rudy. So what exactly is this deal? Did she tell you about Edenfalls too? It wasn't Cherien. It was... You don't need to cover for her. She does this. She thinks I'm gonna make a killing, and she wants in on it. And, sure, it's a good investment, but it's closed. Sorry. How closed? It's a tricky investment, Rudy. You know, I can't open it to inexperienced investors. I've analyzed a profitable opportunity. We got to move fast. I used to assess knuckle balls in less than a second. That fast enough for you? Less than a second? Come on. The spotted crawfish. The what? It's an endangered species that lives on a piece of prime real estate about 60 miles north of here. 215 acres, beautiful, lush, green land just begging for concrete. Sad sack who owns it is stuck with it for the last 30 years. Point being? Point being that in last 30 years, the little spotters have gone crazy, screwing all over the place. Fish and wildlife no longer need to protect them. So now, the land could be developed. They're lifting the restrictions on monday. How do you know that? Got someone on the inside. How inside? Under secretary of the interior inside. So mr. S. Sack, who owns the land, is now quite a happy man. I bet he is. He's gonna be in some serious cash on monday. What? He doesn't know about monday, and on saturday, he's gonna sell his land to me and my investors. You make me one of those investors, and I swear to God, you can call it Rudy Blue estates if you want to. Cal, you're on the inside. Di, you're on the inside. Sammy, you're on the inside, too. - Dad, who's on the outside? - Does anybody else think that the inside-outside problem is just about the smallest one we have? I hate doing this nympho routine. - Don't laugh. - I'm sorry. It's just, I'm feelin' him up, I'm all over him. It don't feel good, and he's just about to put the moves on me, and I can't really blame him. Did you hear any of that? Okay, good. Well, rub his back, and remind him you're in the program. I really need to figure something out here. So we're gonna get some guy to sell a bunch of fake land to you and rudy and a bunch of other guys, right? - Investors. - Investors, yes. So the question is, who are the investors? Who's the guy? Who is anyone involved in this plan? Who are the shills, dad? This is a big operation. We don't know any shills here. The only people we know here are the pool guy and Nina. We got a pool guy? What about the people from the trailer park? They would need the money. - They're completely unskilled. - They took 200 bucks off your dad. They live in a trailer park, you guys. They have to act like millionaires. - We act like millionaires. - I will check them out, but we gotta make it on saturday 'cause the office's empty. It's not. Hugh works there on saturdays. - We gotta get him out of there somehow. - This is insane, dad. - Why? - Because we can't do this. I mean, half a million dollars? We don't even know what that means. Look, the biggest thing that we've ever done is sell bogus condos out of that strip mall on myrtle beach. That was just a couple grand for finders fees. - We live in this house. - I know, mom, but people like us, we don't make that kind of money. People make money like this - all the time. - But we don't know what we're doing. I mean, we're totally in over our heads here. You know that. So what? We didn't know what we were doing when we first came here. Your dad needs our help, okay? So we're gonna help him. If he don't get this money, he's gonna lose his job, and if he loses his job, you're gonna lose this sweet life you like so much. So either we go or we stay, but if we stay, you gotta roll with it. What the hell is that smell? Oh, the rug cleaners were here. They were spot testing. They're gonna clean the whole office tomorrow. - Tomorrow's saturday, I gotta work. - Well, you have to work at home. No, I'm gonna work here, Cherien, like I always do. Sure they can just work around you. I don't think the chemicals'll be too bad. What do they got goin' here? "mono-tetrachloride, sodium ozone phosphate, nitric gastro-hydraulic-mercury." Ah, should be fine. I'll let them know you'll be here. Acting? - What kind of acting? - Are there gonna be cameras? - I don't want cameras. - Shut up, gerard. There will be no cameras, gerard. For the sum of $1,000 apiece, you'll be acting in a theatrical event. You will be acting in a traing seminar. - Like for emergencies? - Like for emergencies. Like for investments, like for an emergency investment. no questions asked. No taxes, no withholding, no questions asked. - Is that last part clear? - Fine, but what's in it for us? Money, gerard. Christ. Look, how do we know you'll come through? Air force one. Keep it as collateral. But no test drives, okay? It's on fumes. Hang on. Excuse me, gentlemen, lady. What is it? Holy crap! Oh, my gosh. Are you okay? My throat's closing up. Should never have hired those shithead rug cleaners. What are you lookin' at? How are the investors? A little scary, actually, one of them particularly. But mr. Blue called. Your friend, he's worried about a losing streak, so you better go round there and rub his thighs and turn them into a fire. Rudy, thank you so much for meeting me, 'cause I was shoppin', and I almost pulled the store clerk into the dressing room and made him... You know... God! Man, I really feel like I can talk to you, you know? And I feel like I can talk you, too, Cherien. Great, 'cause I need your help. I haven't had sex in 14 hours. It makes me kind of jittery, you know. - Anyway, how are you? - I'm good. Good. I had lunch with Doug. My Doug? We're gonna do a little business deal together. No, no. I do not know how I feel about my boyfriend and - my ex-husband doing deals together. - Wait, I'm not your boyfriend, Cherien, you know. I mean, well, I would be. I'm tempted. I'm really tempted. Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right. I keep forgetting. I forget we're in program. We're program. We don't... We don't think about each other that way no more. Right. We've grown. - It's a door we choose not to open. - Right. So, I figured it would be okay to invest a little money with Doug. Sure. And... And... And here's the thing. The thing is, I'd really like you to come to the meeting with me. What meeting? This little investor thing. Truth is, uh... My ex-wife made all the big money decisions. I tell people that she didn't, but she really did. She was very good at it, and... Well, let's just say since the divorce, I haven't exactly been hitting them out of the park, you know? I even tried not changing my socks for a while, but anyway, I was thinking if I had another smart, really pretty woman sittin' next to me... Y'all don't need me. A man of your accomplishments, your achievements, everything you've done on the field and off, you don't need anyone. But I gotta say, there's nothin' that turns me on more than an accomplished, money-makin' man. Now, that's the truth. So, rudy... I would be so, so honored... To be with you. Yes, rudy. Yes, I will go to your meeting with you. Pack this stuff up, everything in boxes. Move this thing out here. Okay, I want this table to the right, this table around to the left. - Whose left? His left? - No, gerard, his left. Just that way. This one comes round here, this one forms a line like this. Gonna create an amphitheater here. This is opera. Look, don't question me. I am the director, - and you guys are the actors, okay? - Okay, honey, you got a little vein poppin' in your neck. You need to breathe. Look, our test client is gonna be here in an hour. You're just gonna sit quiet - and playing millionaires. - She's playing a millionaire? - Shut the hell up, gerard. - Okay, would you be quiet, please? My stylist is gonna come, you'll get nice clothes, and you're gonna look like millionaires. - She probably once blew a millionaire. I love where we're going here, but it's not helping. this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna be mr. Balsam, heir to the balsam fortune. Got it? Who are you? - Nope. - Mr. Balsam. Fred, you're gonna be mr. Marsho, all right? - Of the marsho hedge fund. - Marsho. What's a hedge fund? You know, when you keep something in a hedge? Well, imagine a fund in a hedge. Imelda, I want you to be signora Boiva, right? Ceo of Argentina transmobile. - How's your spanish? - Oh, it's perfecto. Gracias, papito. That's easy for you to say. Uh, Cal, what you gonna be? Dieter platter, german internet genius. Yeah, a very quiet genius. Okay. Olin. Where's Olin? Olin, snap out of it! You don't have to yell. Olin, this is important. You're a key player here. You're mr. Abbott, and you are the seller. Aw, jesus, Wayne, he is drunk off his ass. - Olin, this is 9:00 in the morning. - Just give me some coffee.I'll be fine. No, he won't be. He's on a bender - He's gonna wreck our whole show. - What the hell do you care? I care because I'm a professional. A professional gas station attendant. I'm a musician, you two-bit whore! Mr. Blue just called. He's on his way. He'll be here at 10:00. Okay, everybody, remember what I'm saying. Do this, work things out, help me here, okay? Everybody help me. Put those in there. And, sweetheart, please don't steal anything. - It won't fit down your tube top. - All right. Olin, snap out of it! You do not have to yell. - Take those off, try these. - You are lookin' good, olin. - I think I need more concealer shit. - He's good, isn't he? Oh, yeah, he's the best. Okay, imelda, honey, you got to come out. - He's gonna be here any minute. - No, - they're gonna laugh at me. - No one will laugh at you. Okay, the thing to rember, at the right time, do not forget to take out your cell phones. Ferrari, 2 o'clock. - He's here! - All right, places, come on, people - Imelda, come out! - All right, keep your hair on. You say anything, I'll rip your friggin' head off. Imelda, tattoo. Rudy, good to see you. So you want in on this after all? Yeah, well, I'm thinkin' yeah, yeah, probably. I, uh... Abbott's here. He is so glad to be unloading this land. You sure you want to do this? Because i will happily put in another 500 grand for your share. Hello, rudy. Sorry I'm late. What are you doing here? This is invitation only. I was invited. Right, rudy? Hey, you are bringing a date to a limited partnership offering? He's not my date. He is my sponsor. Mr. Abbott is getting very impatient. He says he has a 2:00 charity function. Thank you, Di... Helen. This way. You know, I'd really like it if she could be here, if you don't mind. I promised I'd look after her. You know, she's horny as a toad, that one. Well, it's your funeral. You've got a... So, mr. Abbott, I think you'll find the price of three million dollars is more than fair, and I strongly suspect that you will find it very difficult to get that price from any other buyer, especially considering that your land has endangered species zoning restrictions, and that no development is possible upon your land. I know the development is one of the things you were hoping for. That development was one of your hopes. - Mr. Abbott! - Yes, yes, I had hoped to develop... - Alas. - Alas, yes. So, therefore... As environmentally, socially conscious, aware people, we believe that your land would be perfect for a bird sanctuary, named after yourself, the abbott aviary habitat. And not only that, we will build a visitors center for this bird sanctuary, which will be called the abbot aviary habitat visitors center. Whoever can say that quickly will win an award. This is the idea, this is the scope of what we wanna do with your beautiful land, We will buy your land for twice what you paid for it in 1974. So, mr. Abbott, what do you say? Well, I... yes, I might as well sell. Excellent. Now, if you could just sign the contract. You look so rich. There you go. It's all yours. Thank you, mr. Abbott. You just follow helen here. This way, mr. Abbott. - Hey, can I just ask one thing? - I'm afraid we have notime to question. - Thank you, and... - Aren't you rudy blue? Yep, that's me. Shit the bed, I thought so. I thought that you... You know, I got to tell you, you are my favorite player of all time. - Thank you. - Enough of that, mr. Abbott. But, my God, man, and I say this from my heart, you have got to lay off that underage pussy. Baby. Hey, look, can't I just stay and watch? Look, you just sold three millions dollars with the land, buddy. You don't stand around and watch after that. I know, but if I can get his autograph, I can sell it on ebay. This will cover the autograph. And so, ladies and gentlemen, say goodbye to the abbott aviary habitat visitors center, and say hello to Edenfalls II. Edenfalls II... 144 luxury homes in a garden setting with a gated community around you. Gated, of course, to keep out the riffraff. A safe, secure community, a safe, secure investment. And you're sure the protection is gonna be lifted on monday. I'm sure as sure. I happen to have some photos of mr. Undersecretary underneath his secretary, and so we are assured of his assurance. I'm in. Sounds good. Very good. Now, if you could just turn to the red folder, the limited partnership agreement and sign that, that would be wonderful. Baby? - Is there a problem? - No. Rudy? There's no problem. There's no problem, is there? It's extortion. It's illegal. - It's only a little illegal. - Yeah, but it's illegal. I just got out of jail. I... I can't do stuff like this. If we've done that, then if you could please and transfer the money into the Panco account. Please make the transaction. Yes, please, wire the money. No, I don't understand why this is so difficult for you. Thank you. 6-6-5-9-6-5. Please sign. Please. Banco rio dinero? Transfer 500,000 to Panco, inc. Yes, 1-1-3-5-6. Gracias. "rudy blue."

Holy mother of shit! - Listen, I want my money back. - You can't get the money back. It's in Panco already. But it's a very good investment. 32% over two years. I'm a silent partner, you understand? For all you know, I'm still in prison. - Oh, jesus, I could go back to prison. - Rudy, I love you. Oh, stay away from me, both of you! Rudy, rudy. Call me. - It's not as bad as it seems. - Get away! You died so well. Very good, bob. That is the end of the emergency training program, and I think we really learned something here today. - That was so great. - Very good. How was it? I thought maybe I came in a little early, and I think I could have been stronger on that second line. It was very good. It was... It was real. It was very precise. You were in the moment.
