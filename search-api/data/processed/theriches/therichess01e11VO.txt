You want to wear his suits, and you want me to be to his dead wife? Do you really think dad has a plan? He stole the money, ma lost the money, and now we're here in a dead guy's house. How'd y'all get in the front gate? We live here. Why are we gettin' a bill from Mountain View Nursing Home for $4,700 a month? - Must be where Cherien's mother is. - Come on, ma, - we're getting out of here. - It's Cherien's mom. Does it matter? If my husband's gay? It doesn't matter to me. Well, you're not his wife. School bus is here! Oh, him? Aw, got yourself a buffer boyfriend. - Aw, Jesus Christ, chunky! - What's wrong with you idiots? Shut the goddamn door! I wanted to be a partner, but there is my partner lying on the ground. Something about it makes me sick to my stomach. I'm not lying, Wayne. I told you, I'm off that shit. I was gonna flush it! How big a supply is this? - A month? A week? - No, Wayne! No! No! Are you tryin' to blow this whole thing to hell? How do you like it, watching someone you love self-destruct? I've messed up your whole life. All I ever wanted was a messed-up life with you. Baby, you gotta get up. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. You gotta get up, go to work What? Yeah, let me see. Meth hangovers are the worst. Just the worst. You know, you gotta drink a lot of water. Come on. - You still got your job at Panco, baby. - Don't want it. - Hugh's an asshole. - Yup, he is. Now, I was up all night, and I've been thinkin'. I've really been screwin' things up since we got here, you know? And, after yesterday, Jesus, I can't do this anymore to you and the kids. This life we got here is a good thing. I think we just gotta take it on, you know? Make it our own. Really? Sure. Now, you know what else I've been thinkin', Wayne? We need to get us some ishka. We need to clear all the shit out, do a cleansing, all of us together. Remember? Like that time in Kentucky, when we went in the river with all snow on the rocks? Now? I'm sure there's a cold river around here somewhere. - No. - Yeah. Cleansing baby, cleansing. Now? Come on. Let's just do it. The school bus is gonna be here any minute. Mom, you know, I got a math quiz today. I can't just go jumpin' in a river. - Sorry. - It's library day. I gotta return my books, otherwise, I can't get new ones. - Banana. - With a bit of vanilla yogurt. Okay, let's just do it later then, all right? We'll do it after school. Look, we got to deal with the whole dr. Morganstern situation, 'cause you really miss all your friends at the home, don't you, mama? She doesn't miss her friends. She likes it here. - Can we talk about this later? - We're gonna have to talk about it eventually because, you know, we can't keep her. - Hey! Give me that, you jerk! Give it. It's Eric. He wants to know if you're wearin' the shirt. What's "the shirt"? Eric bought them both matching shirts. It's very cute. They are not matching, Cal. They're similar. You're such an idiot. I thought we had to get to work. What's wrong with you? He's such a dick, mom. Don't mind him. I think it's nice you got a friend. - You do? - Yeah. It means you're gettin' adjusted to this place. I guess. Hey, I want to show you somethin'. I'm through with it, see? I'm through with it, all of it. - Wow, that's great, mom. - No, no, I mean it. - I'm... I mean it. - Okay. 'cause I don't want you to feel like you got to protect me no more. It's not fair, and, you know, I'm gonna do it myself. - Whatever you say, mom. - School bus is here, Di. - Gotta go. Bye. - Okay. Hugh's not back yet. What do you mean, he's not back yet? Where is he? What's he doing? He told Kimmie he was at the mortgage brokers convention in Reno, but when she called the hotel, he wasn't registered. Shit. He just called and fired Larry in legal. Called him a sniveling dickhead. He cancelled his company credit card. You know what? He did the same thing to Sabrina in accounting. - You're kidding. - And now he won't even answer his phone. - Does he do this often? - Not since I've been here. - It's kind of freakin' everybody out. - Did you hear about Hugh? - I just did. - Maybe he's having a nervous breakdown. I had a professor who did that once, he ended up naked on the Golden Gate Bridge. What if he's under investigation by the FBI or something? Let me tell you something, if anything goes down, I ain't taking the rap for Hugh's shit. - Is Panco going under? - No, of course, it isn't. I'm sure everything's gonna be fine. Now, everyone, just go back to work. I'll go... make some calls. You know what's going on here. - Hugh's on a meth bender. - Wayne, the man is an animal stone-cold sober. God knows what kind of mess he's gonna make for himself. - I know, we gotta do something. - Well, these people are panicked. They need leadership. You want to be a partner? That white one. Well, this is what you want, ain't it? Is it what you want? Long as we're here, if we're gonna stay, might as well commit, right? ~ SeriesSub.com ~ present Transcript: swsub.com Synchro: Ricana & Synchro: [Yossarian, sheva85] from Synchro: ::ItalianSubAddicted:: Synchro: Season 01 Episode 11 Anything Hugh Can Do, I Can Do Better So there it is. As of this moment, I am in control here. What are you, General Haig? I'm the chief financial officer. I've been here seven years. You, what, seven minutes? What, uh, makes you the boss? Well, Mason, these partnership papers that I have signed with Hugh. - May I? - Absolutely. So this is the situation. Hugh, at the moment, is in a clinic, where he is undergoing intensive Gestalt therapy, designed to purge himself of all of his abusive behavior, which we all know about. This is a good thing, and he'll be back very soon, hopefully better. But, Mason... Thank you, I welcome your question. I welcome all your questions. In fact, my first act as a partner is to institute an open-door policy. Come to me with your questions. Just come on in, let's have a chat. Things are gonna go a little differently around Panco from now on. I talked to Hugh last week about taking tomorrow off. I've got finals. No problem, Aubrey. Your dreams are my command. Great. I've got crim pro and real property, and you know what a killer that's gonna be. What? Oh, now that Larry's been fired, you're gonna have to take over his cases until we hire someone new. - Anything pressing? - Nothing much. A few contracts, pending settlements. Oh, you are going to have to go to court tomorrow on the Oxenberg case. - Court? - It's a hearing. It's not a trial or anything. A nuisance suit against Panco, a little discrimination thing. How little? Hugh intentionally blew the sale on a house in the Paradise Grove development. The couple is claiming discrimination. On the basis of what? They're gay. Larry filed a motion for summary judgment. Aubrey, quick snap test. Summary judgment, which means we are going to try to... Get the suit dismissed. You will. That is, I'll be gone, remember? Finals? Hey, I got an idea. Call Larry. Tell him new boss in town. He's got his job back. Larry is too pissed to go for that. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if he's filing termination suit as we speak. Well, I am excited by this, but, uh it's not my specialty, you know? I'm a securities lawyer. Don't worry. Larry's done all the work. All you have to do is show up. With your experience, it should be a piece of cake. Piece of cake. I don't get many guests over for dinner. I used to be real popular in high school, but, lately... I don't know, must be the arm. I bet you were a cheerleader in high school. I was. How'd you guess? Well, now, what about you? What were you in your teenage years? I used to start a lot of fires. I'm kiddin' you. I was football, quarterback. Now, see, I knew it. You got that look. I'm sorry to keep you out here. He just... He doesn't allow anybody in the house while he's watching "Jeopardy!" - I think you're pretty. - Excuse me? I said, i think you're pretty, Hartley. Be careful now. Know what I'm gonna do for you? Gonna do all your landscapin' for free. I'm gonna cut them shrubs over there. Oh, God. Is your cake done? No, that's him. I can't hire you, Dale. You need to go. He can't keep you in a gilded cage. Oh, you wanna bet? I got the prenup from hell. Hugh's had it out for me since the day I was hired. Well, that must be difficult, but let's look forward. He threw a cell phone at my head once because he spilled a glass of water on his own desk. That's not good. Um... What can we do to make Panco better for you, Greg? - I'd like my own office. - Right. And an assistant would be nice. All right. Well - we'll see what we can do. - Really? Panco does not have to be run by fear. We can do better than that. Smile, grandma. This'll help bring some glow to your face. You seem like a winter. Let's try some pink. You have very pretty eyes, grandma. See, when you accentuate your best features, you feel better about yourself. I sure do. Banana. I won't let them take you away in a van. If they do, i'll hotwire a car and come and get you. I'll take a large cadillac. No, marcy. I know it was a bad divorce, i do. Hugh always spoke very fondly of you. What can we at panco do for you? A parking space with my name on it. Better "hold" music. Healthier snacks in the vending machine. Other companies give their employees parking spaces all the time. Really? A longer lunch break 'cause i barely have time to eat my yogurt. That seems reasonable. I know he's an asshole. No, i'm not sayin' he's not an asshole. He's just an asshole who i've got to find right now, so i was wondering if you could... Just with my name. It doesn't have to be too big, just little. Staff meetings, 'cause we're supposed to have weekly staff meetings. I mean, what happened to them? And...? A damn parking space. Well... That was pointless. All right! Oh, Jesus! Well... What's pointless? Talking to these people. Whatever happened to hopes and dreams? They have no vision. Their lives have become so narrow. They're just working to work. Wayne, it's pretty hard to have hopes and dreams when you're just tryin' to survive, you know? Okay, let's see the timeline. Death of louis xv. May, 1774. All right, king louis xvi crowned. June, 1774. Hey, there. Nice shirt. Thanks, dude. Okay, eric, let's, uh... Let's keep going. King louis xvi tried for treason and monarchy was abolished. 1792, and that is when marie antoinette lost her head. You know, it's close, but, actually, it's in 1793. Hi, di. Hi, eric. - Hello. - Hey, mom. You want to stay for dinner? i would, but i gotta go. I told my mom i'd be back at 5:30. Wait, i thought you're gonna help me with the reign of terror, baby. You know, it's my weakest thing. You were gonna quiz me. I can't. I got my dad's car. Well, i can quiz you. I love history. That's okay, mom. It's fine. No, no, it'll be good. Here. What was the initial impact of the death of "lewis x-v-i"? "lewis x-v-i." that's a good one. What? No, never mind, mom. It's no big deal. It's cool. Why? What's funny? Well, it's "louis the sixteenth," but, i mean, don't worry about it. Come on, eric, i'll, uh, walk you out. See you later, mrs. Rich. - Bye, eric. - Shut up, cal. Well, lewis, louis, who gives a shit? He's a buffer prick, ma. Gay money, straight money, what difference does it make? Well, let me try to clarify that, doug. Five families decide to buy houses in a cul-de-sac in paradise grove. Five churchgoing families, who want to create a family-value-oriented community in which to raise their kids. - So...? - So, they're in escrow, okay? One day, they look over, and they see two women. Two women in khakis and penny loafers, shakin' hands with the realtor in front of the sixth house of their little cul-de-sac. Khakis and penny loafers? It's not that they don't like gay people, mind you. They just don't want them living next door. So, let the churchgoers move somewhere else. Well, the problem is, is... Greg, please. The problem is we've been just as much a victim of the downturn in the housing market as anybody. The houses in paradise grove just aren't selling that well. We've used some bullshit collateral to get our last loan from the bank, and the only real source of money to repay those loans is from those five homes in escrow. And while you're thinking about it, put this in your hat and smoke it... All our loans are cross-collateralized. If one loan fails, the whole house of cards folds. Meaning, panco. That's right, my friend. So, you ask me what the difference is between gay money and straight money? In this part of the country, christian money begets christian money, and gay money puts you out of business. - Hi, nina. - Hi, there. Come on in. I didn't know you did pottery. Yeah, um, started as a hobby. Now it's sort of taken over my life. Oh, hi, cherien. Uh, this is wes. Wes, our neighbor, cherien. - Oh, so she's the one... - Yes. We're on our way to the market. Need anything, nina? No, thanks. Well, we'll see you later. Nice to meet you. They're making a bouillabaisse for dinner. He seems all right. Wes? Oh, he is. Real nice. Good cook. So, - he and jim are... - Friends, yeah. For some time now, it seems. And you're all just hangin' out together? Jim and i have been doing a lot of talking since your dinner party, dahlia. I guess you could say we've come to an understanding. Neither of us wants to downscale at this stage of our lives, and there's zinny to think about, so we're sharin' the house. That's about all we're sharing. Well, i do not know how you are doing it. Whee! I got a problem, nina. - With this? - No. With didi. I don't know how to talk to her anymore. I don't understand. It's weird. When they're little, they just kind of look up to you. They just want to dress like you, be like you. I mean, people used to call her my little twin. And now she doesn't want to have nothin' to do with you. Well, i'll tell you one thing. I sure as hell don't have any answers. Zinny hasn't been out of her room except to go to school since she turned 13. She is a real bitch. Most days, i just leave her alone. It's either that or kill her. Oh, god. I got a big stack of books if you want to read 'em. Maybe you'll have better luck than i have. Is that... It's a lighthouse. Nice job, di. - What, cal? - What? You've turned into a total buffer asshole. That's what. Why? Because i actually study? I don't give a shit if you study. Well, what do you think we're supposed to be doing here, - cal? Robbing houses? - No, di, i think we're supposed to be wearing matching shirts under our uniforms and thinkin' we're better than everyone else. I do not think that i am better than anyone else, cal. I'm just trying to get along here. Maybe you should try that. Maybe. Well, i may not know so much of law, mr. Feller, but i know what's right and what's wrong, and i know what you're asking is wrong. Thank god. - Where are you? - I don't know. Somewhere in the desert, i'm guessin'. Right. Well, are you okay? I mean, everybody's worried. Doug, did you know that muslims fast for the entire month of ramadan? Get this... No, i didn't know that. Look, i gotta talk to you about the oxenberg case, okay? Get this: it's not just food they give up. They give up all sensual pleasures and... Oh, thank you, tarquin. Sex and, you know? - So... - Carnal stuff. So let me get this straight... You are in the desert with some muslims? No, but i am fasting... I think. And it's brought me a shitload of clarity, too. Here, listen to this... "the candle is not there" "to illuminate itself." is that heavy or what? Extraordinarily heavy. Okay, look, hugh. - Doug, buddy. - No. You're my only friend. You're the only one that gets this sickness we call life. Okay, listen to... Listen to me, hugh... i'm feelin' a little... I gotta go. - Doug, i'm getting a little dizzy here. - No. Hugh. Hugh, hugh, stay with me! God damn it! Hey, how is it goin'? Fine. Good. That's good. What are you doin'? Well, di, i just want you to know that i'm here for you. If you want to talk about anything, if you feel like sharing. Sharing what? Just talking, lettin' me know what's goin' on in your life. I don't feel like it. Well, you know, what i'm hearing now is that you're not in the mood to talk about it right now. Yeah, that's what i'm saying. Okay, well, you know what? That's too damn bad because i have somethin' to say to you delilah malloy! I don't like the person you're becomin'. You're turning into a mean, nasty little bitch. and that is not the person i raised! The person that you raised? You were in prison. I was in prison for two years. I never stopped being your ma. I took care of everybody... Dad, sam, cal. And now you, what? You want to come back, and you want to be the mom. I think it's a little bit late for that. You know what your problem is? It's that you're just scared. You're just scared that i'm gonna be better than you, that i'm gonna go to college, mom, and i'm gonna be somebody. I gonna be somebody that you could never be. Bullshit. You know what scares me? How quickly you've become one of them buffers. It's "those" buffers, mom. You have completely lost touch with what's important. Look at that guy you picked. He is nothin' more than a haircut and a shit-eating grin. I love him. Oh, you love him? - What does that mean to you? - I'm sleeping with him. Without a blessing? You're a real little buffer now. Congratulations. Since its inception nearly 15 years ago, panco properties has had a history of community-building and family values. We sell to families... It's what we do. We sell to all kinds of families: red, yellow, black, white. Are you really gonna say that? Well, i was thinking of. That sounds like some kind of bullshit to me, wayne. What's that got to do with anything anyway? Well, what am i supposed to say? This is about discrimination. We do not discriminate under the law. A gay couple has complained that hugh and panco have refused to sell them their house because they are gay. Now, here is the thing: gay people are not specifically protected under the fair housing act. Hugh can absolutely refuse to sell to them and not be breaking any laws. Are you gonna stand there and tell me that that's okay? Absolutely. It's completely legal. But, no, no, i mean, it's not okay, but in this state and in the whole country, as it is, gay couples are not protected under the constitution. - Well, they should be. - Well, that's not the point. The law is on hugh's side. I can win this. So you're gonna walk into court tomorrow, and you're gonna defend hugh's right to be a total flamin' asshole? Yeah. That is what is so great about the law. Well, that makes you an asshole, too, wayne. Excluding people? Oh, my god, are you kidding me? What if that was your child, huh? What if that was your son? You are no better than hugh. Well, if i don't do it and panco collapses, what are we gonna live on? Air? So this is it, huh? The american dream. What happened? This morning, you were all gung-ho about me stepping up for hugh, making a commitment, showing leadership. Well, maybe i changed my mind. Maybe i thought you were gonna be better than hugh. I am better than hugh. I have already made a difference. Honey, i'm just doing my job here. And, you know, we should all be pretty damn glad that i can do it because it is not easy. I gotta go into a real courtroom tomorrow, argue in front of a real live judge. You know what? I think i'm gonna do okay. What is the point if all you're doing is buying into their buffer bullshit? It is not all black and white. Not all buffers are bad. Oh, really? Well, i'm real glad you think so 'cause your daughter's sleepin' with one. So, di. Here you go, mom. You're not doug. And you're not my mom, but we're having fun with pancakes, aren't we? So, baby? Yeah, dad? - Got enough money for lunch? - Yeah. Yeah, you gave me $10 yesterday, rember? Right, right, right. Okay. I gotta go get ready. Thank you for breakfast. Okay. Di? Dad, we only did it once. We used protection. I don't know how i feel about it, okay? Okay, okay, great. Good talk. That wasn't so hard. Don't know what i was worried about. I made some calls. Anyone i know? Well, i had a chat with didi. It seems she and eric had sex once, and she used, uh, you know, birth control. It made me feel better. We had sex when you were 15. We were married, wayne. We were in love. She didn't even talk to us. She didn't get no blessing. I have no idea who that girl has become. Well, she's living here now. If we were living back there, she'd probably be married to that idiot and pregnant. Is that what we want? Baby, you're taking this too hard. Didi is still didi. No matter what she says or doesn't say, she still needs you, and i need you, too. I got the whole of panco in my hands. I can't do this without you. Well, i'm still here, ain't i? - Where's aubrey? I need aubrey. - Finals. Right. Damn. Anyone hear from hugh? No, but there are some people waiting in your office. Who is waiting in my office? I think they said their name was "mockingbird." doug, doug, i know you promised greg his own office, but i actually have more seniority than he does. All right. Well, you get an office, too. We don't have the space. - All right, well, no one gets an office. - What?! That's bullshit! I'm liz oxenberg. Oxenberg. Yes, that oxenberg. - Hello. - This is max. - Hi, max. - Hi. Gwen doesn't know i'm here. She'd kill me if she did. I just wanted to see the face behind panco. Well, i'm hardly the face behind... You know, i didn't even want that piece of shit house originally. It's too small. The construction is crap. It doesn't have much of a backyard. - So, why... - Because it's all we could afford on both our salaries, and it's in the best public school system in ducaine. We wanted that for max, even if it meant we had to live next door to a bunch of homophobic bigots. They didn't even give us a chance. We're not worthy of their cul-de-sac. Guys like you are lucky. You will never experience what that feels like. See you in court, mr. Rich. Come on, max. Can i talk to you, doug? Now is not a good time. I sit next to tony, as you know, and, lately, i've noticed he's been making a lot of personal calls. Long distance personal calls. I just... Write it up, and we will talk about it later. Well, i just know hugh wouldn't like it. Ashleigh, try hugh's cell number again, and keep trying until he answers. And then? And then i'll talk to him, sweetheart. What?! Was greg just in here ratting me out, just because he's pissed about the whole office thing? What a friggin' wuss. You know what you need to do, doug... What i need to do is work! So what i need you to do is to get out of the goddamn office, tony! All of you, stay out of my office! I am working! I have to be in court today! Do you have to be in court today?! Thank you! Just stay out... Well, didn't take you long to turn into one of them screamers? They won't leave me alone. I'm just sayin', wayne. You're scarin' me. I got him. - He's on line one. - Thank you. What do you want, doug? Tryin' to relax here. Hugh, you still with the muslims? What the hell are you talkin' about? i've gotta talk to you about the oxenberg hearing today, okay? Oxenberg? Yeah, you know, the paradise grove thing? Oh, the carpet munchers. What's the problem? Pretty clear-cut case, ain't it? Well, yeah, legally, absolutely. Clear-cut case, but... jesus christ, don't start with the morals crap. You're a lawyer. You don't have morals. Oh, not my face, too, darlin'. This stuff smells like shit. - No, hang on. - Here's the point on this oxenberg thing, it's just business. It ain't personal. I don't have a problem with gays, but... Here, look at it this way. You paid a shitload for your house, right? - Yeah. - Right, right? Well, you want to look out the window and see a bunch of guys french kissin' or havin' some kind of naked pool party with your kids around? Shit, no. I pay that kind of money for a house, i don't want to live next to somebody i don't want to live next to! It's my right as an american citizen. But i have met the oxenbergs. They have a kid, you know? They're harmless. Doug, i sell that house to them, i lose millions of dollars. End of story. I gotta go. This nice girl's gonna finish wrappin' me up here. Hugh, just... You don't have to do this, wayne. Dahlia, you don't understand. hey. What's up? - Hey, di. - Hey. Gettin' some gum. Eighty-one cents. Out of ten. There you go. I really don't want all this change, man. I'm sorry. I mean, you can probably use it more than i can. You mind if i give you 10 ones for a 10? - Whatever. - Yeah? Thanks. I really don't want to carry around a lot of bills, you know what i mean? You know what? Um, i'm not thirsty. Let's just... - Let's go. - What? I am. - Let's get back. - Wait. Hold on. What's... What is the rush? You gave me too much, dude. Oh, shit. I'm an idiot, man. I'm sorry. Is that witchblade? I love witchblade. I'm more of aspawnguy myself. Spawn's for freaks, man. I'm sorry. I'm holdin' up the line. I'm talkin' too much. Here, why don't i just give you this for the 20? Is he doin' what i think he's doin'? You know what? I don't care. I'm not gonna stick around to watch this. - Come on. - Thanks. - Thanks, man. - All right now. Next. Where are you?! There was a man. What man? I made some calls. What's wrong with you? With what? Why did you short count the sales guy? You don't need the kale. Just keepin' up my skills, di. You could have been arrested. You did it in front of eric. I did it in front of eric? Eric is clueless. He knew exactly what you were doing, cal. Luckily, he just thinks you're a total asshole. Good. This is who i am. I'm all right with that. Fine. You know what? Be whoever you want to be, cal, but don't screw this up for me. These people... Your boyfriend, the teachers, the neighbors, i don't get it. Why do you give a shit what they think of you? Because i like them, cal. How many of them will be there for you in the end? When it really counts, di, when all this goes to shit? Not one. You know, i used to look up to you, and now i don't even know who you are anymore. You don't know who i am anymore? I'm not the one who's changed, di. I'm not the one who's turned my back on my family'cause i'm ashamed of who i am. All rise. Honorable judge pearline now presiding. In the case of oxenberg, thomas v. Panco inc. - Your honor, douglas rich for the accused... For the defendant. May it please the court. Your honor, state and federal laws prohibit discrimination on the base of race, religion, and gender. - However... - Let me stop you right there, mr. Rich. Your honor? I have read your arguments, mr. Rich, and you are right. They don't have a case. Your summary judgment is granted. Case is dismissed. Bailiff, what's next? That's it? You won your argument, mr. Rich. Do you want a medal? Bailiff? Case number 0-2-7-0-5-9-5, Atkinson v. Layton. What are you doin'? Don't you know i fired you? I don't need to get paid. Well, you can't just put plants in my yard. I told you, everett doesn't like me having friends. Then we won't be friends. Dale, you need to go. I think you're a treasure. - I'm gonna call the police on you. - Go ahead. I'll call my husband. God, you are beautiful. I am gonna paint your house from top to bottom. Please go. You want me to go? Or do you want me to move in? Everett hears everything that goes on in that house. I think he's got cameras. - I think he's got me bugged. - Then i'll move into the pool house! I'll be discreet. Dale, you are really cute, but i think you might be crazy. I'm gonna be your handyman. I'm gonna come in real handy. - His back is broken. - Broken? But, apparently, only enough to put pressure on the spinal cord. The only way to remove that is to operate. - Then why haven't you? - I thought you understood.
