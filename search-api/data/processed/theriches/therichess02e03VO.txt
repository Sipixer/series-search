- Miss Fedley's the head of Rosemere. - You're interested in Rosemere? Why do you want to break in? The computers hold the key to our future. You get us inside, Lane'll care of the rest. You now have an A- in calculus. And where the hell is my best friend, Doug Rich? You can't bribe Pete. I have to try. Pete, you okay? Jesus! - I scared you. - What did you do with Pete? You killed him. I hit him, and then... But he fought back. You murdered him! We said 50-50. We are in this together. We're gonna bury Pete, and then that's the end of our collaboration. And I'm never gonna see you again. What happened with Pete? - Did he take the money? - Pete's fine. Everything's all right. Pete went home. Bayou Hills, it's the deal of a lifetime, Doug. $150 million, - and you cash in on $13 million. - $13 million? $13 million? All we got to do is be the Riches for a few months, the deal closes, we cash in, check out, and adi√≥s. Just like any other con. This is home. Yeah, ma... For the time being, anyhow. I'll have a grande mochaccino. - Yeah, I call the jacuzzi. - I got the couch in front of the tv. Think I'm gonna sleep for about three days. You're under arrest for breaking and entering rosemere academy. That's ridiculous. - They're just kids. - Who committed a second-degree felony. - Excuse me. My son was brought here. - Name? Rich, Cal Rich. We're holding him with the others. Pay the bail, and he's yours. - Shit. - Cal Rich is it? Now, is he new in school this year? That name doesn't sound familiar. Yeah, we just moved here from Tampa. H.L. Palmer. Kid's brent. This is Bob Spurlock. His kid's Willie. And Afton Boatright, father of Lane. So what's the story? Boys supposedly had a business going, charged money for changing grades. Little shits are facing felony computer-fraud charges, not to mention breaking and entering. Ask me, a couple of months in youth authority might not be a bad thing for these boys. That's fine unless you want your kid getting into college someday, 'cause no one's getting into princeton with a criminal record. I think it's in all our best interests if we just work on this together. How do you suggest we do that? Strategy meeting. Discuss our options. What's say I get my secretary set us all a lunch for tomorrow? Good. - Where do I pay this? - Over there. - Do you take checks? - Bail bonds or cash. - They let you out of the pokey? - It's not a joke, Di di. - Could do time for this. - Come on, ma, I bumped the lock. I didn't even let them change my grades. - Did they take your prints? - Photographed me and everything. Great. With a criminal record, you'll never get into college now. Like I'm going to college. I don't think college is really the issue. You don't know what you're gonna do? But now you may not have the option. Dad, I haven't been convicted yet. Besides, maybe I should just disappear for a while. No, no, this family is gonna stick together no matter what. We're just staying around long enough to get the money, and then we cash out, and we're gone. There's a castle in Galway for sale. We could get it for $3 million. That's what i'm talking about. I'd settle for just being the Malloys. Malloys with a shitload of money. Come on, put you to bed. Good night. Is that me? I need a shower. That boy can't go to prison. I won't let it happen. There's no amount of money that's worth it. He is not going to prison. This time, everything's different. We're in the big leagues now. I'm Doug Rich, a lawyer. I have power and money and credibility. This time, they can't screw us. You're not Doug. Transcript swsub.com Subtitles Jarick, Grischka FIELD OF DREAMS Quinn, let's go, unless you want to stay for a couple more decades. I left that book there for you on the bed. Do you some good. You never stop. Got to go. Schooltime. - Yes! - No! It's just like a normal day. Everyone doing things as normal. Not for me. As soon as I've sorted out your problem, you're going to school, too. I got a meeting with Fedley tomorrow to discuss your arrest. Okay, everybody's late. The bus is gonna be here. You got to get your backpacks. Di di, come on, get your clothes on. - Come on. - Shit. Hey, Aubrey, how's it going? Hugh didn't show up for an investor meeting. - What meeting? - Something about Bayou hills.</i> Shit. Tell them he had emergency appendectomy and reschedule. Appendectomy? I'll try and track him down. What? Hugh's not there, didn't turn up again. I think I know where he is. You go to work. I'll meet you there. What am I supposed to do at Panco? Just be normal. Normal day, just like every... I have to go to the lunch thing for Cal. Why not? Well, you see with these guys, it's a guy thing. - Hi, there. - Hi, Nina. Hi, Wayne. So, what's the plan? The plan? Well, kids go to school, and I go to work. - That's the plan. - Everything's back to normal? Normal. I'm a normal gal. Wayne's a normal guy. We're just normal folk living a normal life, Nina. Sorry, it's just how it is. I got to go to work. Cal made bail. Normal sucks. What? What do you want, Doug? You had an investors' meeting this morning. You weren't there. Screw 'em! Those guys are minor league. There are plenty more where they came from. What happened to this thing we were gonna do? Remember, Bayou Hills, $150 million, deal of a lifetime? Relax, we're doing it. - I just got to do something first. - Like what? Like get laid. - You're drunk. - Nope. - sober as a judge. - What about Gigi? Well, there's other ships in the sea, ain't there? In fact, I'm expecting one to dock any minute now. No, no, no, we got a deadline. Five days, right? We got to raise this money. You can do whatever you want to do, but I'm getting me a little taste this morning. I'd invite you to stay, but I'm not into that kinky shit. - Hugh, if you just... - I know, I know. I just got to spend some time with somebody who doesn't want anything from me, somebody who... appreciates me for what I have to offer. I get hard at the drop of a hat. Good. Thank you for that. At the drop of a hat, Doug! I just got to take care of some business. Everything's gonna be fine. Why don't you just come into work? Be right there! Well, with the two of you, $1,500. - No, thank you, he's not my type. - Come on in, sweetheart. - You will be coming in to work? - Don't you worry. - Give me the name of a good restaurant. - Roger's. Best steak in town. I want to see you in... It is time for little Hugh to get himself some. How are your grades, Di di? Great. How's the herpes, Kami? Shut up. It's regarding my son Cal. Can you tell Mrs. Fedley that it's Cherien Rich calling again? - Yes, I can. - Yeah, it's very important.</i> - I know that, but she's very busy. - Well, I appreciate she's very busy.</i> Maybe you can remind her I was very busy the day that I found her goddamn bird. You don't have to have profanity. As soon as she has some time, I will let her know that you're calling-</i> - Crap. - Excuse me?</i> I got to go, sweetheart. Hey, there, Cherien. - Welcome back. - What you doing here, Dale? - I'm here to see Doug. - Well, he's not here, so goodbye. - I'll wait. - No, you can't wait. He's gonna be gone a long time. Would you leave? He is expecting me. What? Yeah, you can just ask him. I'll be right over here, and... I'll read this here magazine, contractor journal. Leave a message. Wayne, would you call me back, god damn it? Dale is at Panco, okay? Call me back. Son of a bitch. Geez. - Thank you. - Thank you. Shit. - Gentlemen. - You come here often? This is a total mistake. It's a little, you know, my friend Hugh suggested this place. That's right. You work with Panetta. Yeah. Well, this looks like the sort of place Hugh Panetta might frequent. Sure does. Isn't he married to a stripper? There's an excellent chinese restaurant just across the street. I know I can get us in there. So, what do you say? Chinese restaurant, we'll cross the street, eat there? I have heard they have some nicely marbled kobe beef here. Let's go. Follow her? Here's good. I am sick of waiting. Let me talk to Hugh. About what? About a job. A job? - Well, that ain't gonna happen, Dale. - We'll see. - Ask him. - Why would he want to talk to you? Because him and me got real friendly the other night at your house. At my house? Yeah, him and me and Wayne, had a good old time. You might even say we bonded. You were with them at my house? I guess Wayne didn't tell you. That is interesting. Fedley's a bitch. Always has been. Of course, I'm one of the only board members who didn't endorse her, so... she's gonna take this thing and run with it. - Very nice. - $2,500 a bottle, it better be. So, couldn't we just sue Rosemere? We could make pursuing this case very expensive for them. Dance? - Now, sweetheart, what is your name? - Jasmine. No, thank you. We're working. - Lighten up, Bob. - That's right, Bob. Later then. - If Muriel was to find out I was here. - She's not here. Isn't there something we can do about Fedley before tomorrow's meeting? - Like what, Doug, kill her? - Well... in my experience, everyone has their price. I don't know where you're from, Doug, but around here, we don't bribe. Of course not. We donate. Excellent. Well, let's donate. What do we donate to? That school's always got its hand out for something. - Is there anything that Fedley needs? - To get laid. Okay, besides that. She wants a new gym to compete with Burton's. She's always hocking the board about raising more money for it. - We're still short a million. - That's it. We get her a gym. We give her a million? I'd say keeping my kid out of jail is worth $250,000. - How about you fellas? - Think that would do it? I'm betting she wants that gym more than she wants to put our kids away. - Hell, I'm in. - Me too. Doug? I don't see why not. $250,000? You need to run that by Muriel? Look, I'm just really not that liquid right now. I think it's a good idea. I'm just not able to swing it right now. Anyway, my kid says that he didn't break in or anything. He just paid to have his grades changed. That don't make your kid any less culpable, Bob. That's all right. We'll work something out. We're all in this together, right? Excuse me, fellas. Take your time. - Hey, baby. - So,</i> Dale was at our house when you saw Hugh the other night? What are you talking about? Dale. Dance? What? Dale is here at Panco. Didn't you get my message? He's there right now? Yeah, Wayne, he's here. He's here. He's going on about you guys drinking at my house.</i> - I told you about that, didn't i? - No.</i> No, you didn't. I told you about Hugh coming over. Yeah. And then Dale showed up. Dale showed up. Yeah. Where was Pete during all this? He'd gone by then, long gone, gone home. Sorry, baby. I forgot to mention Dale.</i> It's been a crazy couple of days. Where are you? I'm still at the Cal lunch-meeting thing. Well, Dale wants to ask you for a job right now. Look, baby, can you deal with that? I got to go here. All right, bye. You're home early. I hate those people. What happened? Nothing. Sorry. - What? - We need to talk. - About what? - My job at Panco.</i> I never promised you a job at Panco. I said I would do what I could. Well, I like Panco. Panco isn't really you, Dale. You said you'd get me a job. Now, go get me a job at Panco. - As what? - I don't know. Whatever you are. Well, you're not me, Dale! You're never gonna be me, right? I will do what I can, but I can't guarantee it's gonna be at Panco. Eamon Quinn! Free as a bird. Well, how is it, man? It must be pretty weird? The world must look really different to you after 20 years. I bet you never seen no cellphones, or gameboys or internet porn. So, what have you got for me? I got Wayne Malloy wrapped around my little finger. How's that? It's called people skills, Quinn. I find I have talent for it. - That's funny. - Yeah. I don't remember that about you. It's been 20 years. A lot of life under the bridge. I've changed. So, Wayne Malloy? Yeah, I got like a mid-level sales position, just to get the lay of the land and keep my eye on Wayne. Bollocks. Wayne Malloy would never give you that job. He's not stupid. Wayne Malloy is not as smart as you think he is. I can always tell when you're full of shit, Dale. Just like when you were a spotty, little maggot of 16. I ain't afraid of you anymore, Eamon Quinn. Sure, that's the only thing I like about you, Dale. Your one redeeming feature, you're not that bright. Still want to be partners? You make sure you get that job, huh? Help yourself. - Shut up. - What the hell are you doing? I said... "shut up." Now, I got something I got to say to you, cousin. Are you crazy? What is wrong with you? I am sick and tired of you and Wayne thinking that you're smarter than me. I know exactly what you're up to, and I'm tired of listening to your bullshit. Now... I want you to tell Wayne to get me a job at Panco, or you're going back to prison. It's just one little phone call, and you're back in the slammer. How would you like that? You want to get a job at Panco? You don't know how to do anything, you stupid prick. Get out of here! It is time you started treating me with a little respect. Miss Dahlia. I am in this thing whether you like it or not. And I am gonna get what I want. God, I love family time. I want to kill him. We can't kill him. I want him to die. No $13 million, no nothing, 'cause that psycho could turn me in any time he wants. But that's not what he's after. He just wants in on it... All this... The dream. Putting you away ain't gonna give him shit. What we gonna do? We're gonna keep our enemies close. I think I can get him a job where he can't cause too much trouble. At Panco? Are you crazy? We ain't got much choice. He controls our life. Is that what you're telling me? And I'm supposed to just go along with it? I know what prison is. This is starting to feel real familiar. I'm sorry, baby. It's my fault that Dale can do this to us. God damn it. I'm sorry. So, that's our new mail boy, huh? Guess so. What happened to George? - That's bullshit. - George, you're fired. Deal with it. Where are you? You sound like you're in a wind tunnel. It's the hottest, fastest, most powerful thing on four wheels, and it's my ass in the driver's seat. What are you talking about? Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 Roadster. You've already got a car, Hugh. Several cars. You don't need a car. You need to be here at work. I don't have a car like this, pal. Do you have any idea what 640 horsepower feels like?</i> Whoo, baby! It's better than sex. Well, I'm sure it is. 340k, and at that price, it's a steal. Don't you think it might be a fun idea to come into work and try to finance the Bayou Hills deal? God damn it! Cal, we got to go. Cal, we have to be at school in 10 minutes. I'm not going. You're going. You got to be there. What's the point? The point is, if you don't go, you look guilty. I am guilty. No, you're not. You are not guilty. We've worked out a solution, me and the other dads, so... just come along and look presentable. Everything depends upon this. Everything? Yes, everything! Just trust me on this thing. You're on your way out, huh? You okay? It can wait. Dinner and my dealer... You want to come? $1 million. That is quite a generous donation, H.L. We'd love to see that new gym built before the boys graduate, Jane. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate that. Now, what can I do for you? Yes, well... Your sons broke into my school and changed a number of students' grades. Do you have any idea how much that could have cost Rosemere in terms of our reputation? - We do, and it sickens us... - Please let me finish. In all my years at Rosemere, I have never had anything like this happen. If word of this had gotten out to the college community, our transcripts would have been disregarded, our credibility ruined. From what we understand, there weren't that many grades tampered with. That is not the point, H.L. Rosemere is dependent on its image as a scrupulously honest preparatory school. Your sons have shat all over that reputation! And perhaps that is the price of privilege. Jane, we all think that... I've had to think long and hard about how to best handle this, and this is what I've decided. I will not press charges against your sons, provided... that they tell me who instigated this. That student will be expelled. The board is insistent that I make an example. So, I put it to you, young gentlemen, who is it? Son? You got something to say? - It was Willie. - What? That's a lie. Wait, Willie, is this true? No! Willie was pissed about his lousy chemistry grade. Bullshit. It was me. I did it. My whole idea. I broke into the school. I changed the grades. I'm the one that should be punished. It's only fair. You should probably expel me. We good? We done? You good? All right, good talk. Excuse me. I guess that takes care of it. What is wrong with you? Why did you do that? She agreed to drop the charges. No one in prison. Willie could go to another school. Willie didn't do anything! Willie had his chemistry grade changed. It was Brent's idea, and Lane hacked the computer. I didn't know they were gonna blame Willie. It's not about Willie, Dad. This is about you, okay? You sat there and let them nail him. That's the plan you were telling me about? My plan was to keep you out of prison. I would do anything to give you the chance I didn't have. Look, Cal, this world... it's about power and money, and that's freedom. God, Dad, I don't even know who you are. What you're becoming... whatever it is, I don't want anything to do with it. I'd rather be piss poor with my dad than $13 million richer with whoever you are. Holy mother of shit. It's Eamon Quinn. I thought he got life. How many people you got to kill these days to get life? Frank Linehan, that's you? 'Cause you all grown up. Ain't nobody gonna offer me a beer? I think you ought to leave. Little Ginny Dannegan. Last time I saw you, you were about 12 years old. I always knew you'd be a beauty. You cannot just waltz in here. I saw you. I saw what you did to my daddy and my uncle. I didn't do nothing that wasn't meant to be done. Everybody's got to die sometime. Memento mori. Anybody here know what that means? It means "remember, you're gonna die." The roman slaves used to say it... Memento mori. Remember it, or you're gonna live your life like a dumb animal. Maybe y'all need to read a book every now and then. You can take your shot at me now. Go ahead. It's the code. I know you had to do that on account of what I did to your daddy and all. I got no hard feelings. It would be common courtesy for somebody to help me to my feet. Right about now, huh? Good lads. Somebody get me something to drink, for Christ sakes. Whatever happened to irish hospitality? What? I'm scared all the time. Of what, darling? Feeling something bad's gonna happen. Things I should have done, I didn't do. And now I'm living in this kind of purgatory. That's life in Edenfalls, honey. That's life everywhere. You know what you need? I promised Wayne I wouldn't do that no more. I'm not talking about drugs, honey. All I'm saying is you need to... figure out what it is that you're afraid of. What are you afraid of? Being alone, mostly. Nobody to be loving me anymore, Ntaking care of me anymore. I love you, Nina. I love you, too. Now, come on, stop it. Let's go get us some good shit. What? Nina, you're meeting your dealer at church? Of course not. It's an A.A. meeting. What? No, no, I'm coming right over. I started using, drinking around sixth grade. I dropped out at 10th grade and started hitchhiking across the country. Lost touch with my family. By the '80s, I was slamming meth and robbing people as a way of life. I ate out of trash cans, slept in abandoned houses, until my arrest record caught up with me, and I wound up behind bars. After I did some time, I got my shit together. I cleaned up my prison record, got a whole new life for myself. It was my 30th birthday. I figured, things were going so well, why shouldn't I be able to celebrate? Two days later, I woke up in a motel, naked, sweating, shivering cold. There I was on parole, my life hanging by a thread, and I had relapsed, and I didn't even know why. I had a shotgun at the house, and I thought I'd put the barrel in my mouth and pull the trigger. That way, I'd finally get some peace. That's it. Let's get out of here. Just hold on a second. As I was walking past my son's bedroom while he was sleeping, it hit me. It's like, "what about him? "i mean, do you want him to grow up without a father like you did?" That straightened me out. I've been sober ever since. Thanks for listening and keep coming back. Will you just wait for me in the car? I'm only gonna be a moment. - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure thing. Did you ever break parole? I ain't hanging out with no more damaged men, okay? Now you just go, you big, old drunk. You take him out of here, Doug. I'm calling the cops. Hugh, she's gonna call the cops. She loves this song. This is her song. It's my house. She won't even let me in! Oh, hell, Doug... It just doesn't work without her. What? None of it. I lost it, Doug. You lost what? My mojo. Your mojo? I can't get it up. Not with a hooker, not in a Lamborghini, nowhere. I spent $340,000 on a car. Something better happen in my pants or what's the point? They got pills for that, don't they? It's not the same. I like it natural. It only works with Gigi. I tell you, I'm not a man without her. I got to get her back. I'm going to get her back. That's right... Get her back! Hugh, that would be a huge mistake. Gigi stole your mojo. You go back to her, and she's just gonna steal more. She'll suck it right out of your body. You'll have negative mojo. Believe me, there's only one way you're gonna get it back. How? You got to reclaim your power. - What the hell are you talking about? - This is simple law of physics. Gigi stole something from you. You got to replace it with something equal and opposite. Yet bigger and more powerful, like $150 million... Bayou Hills, deal of the century, a lasting legacy to the genius that is Hugh Panetta. That's you, the source of all your power. Gigi's Delilah to your Samson. She's kryptonite to your super... mojo. And you must avoid her at all costs. Otherwise... I don't know. Well, I do know, Hugh. You got to get some meaning in your life, the kind of meaning that hard-focused, nonstop, 100-hours-a-day-type work's gonna do. Gigi's is an impediment. She's an obstacle. She's a cancer. You must excise her from your life. She's toxic. Most people wouldn't have the balls to talk to me about my wife like that. You really are my friend, aren't you? I love you. I love you, Doug. And I'm not even that drunk anymore. Thank god I puked.
