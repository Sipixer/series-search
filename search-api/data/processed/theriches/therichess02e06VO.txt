Well,his mama's birthdaycame and went, and she didn't get a callfrom her boy. She became worried. She had her neighborcontact me. I'm an old friend. - Of pete's mother's? - Of the neighbors. So,you don't actually know pete. No. And,uh,I hope she alsocalled the police. - Oh,I convinced her not to. - Really? Oh,I find police work in these matters sloppyand incompetent. - Really? - Yeah. Mrs.Rich,I'm afraidI have to ask you something that's not gonna be easy for youto talk about. His mother mentionedthat you and pete might have had a special. relationship. - What? - That he loved you,mrs.Rich. Oh,I see. Now,I've spoken toleif solberg,his therapist, and apparently,pete called him while he was here and saidhe was in a kind of a crisis. Now,that crisisdidn't involve you,did it? Did your husband find out about the relationship? Did pete and dougperhaps have an argument? No. Look,I got to be honestwith you ... he may have had feelingsfor me, but he never,everacted on them. You know what I mean? I mean,he was goingthrough so much. I had no idea. I mean,if I had,maybe I could have helped him. So if you hadany information,I would hope thatyou would come forward. Oh,yeah. Just trying to think. what? Oh,my god. He ... okay,he came over for dinner, and he was telling usall about losing his job and his divorce and all. And then he said,at one point, I wish I could just walk away, just start all over again. I mean,I knew he was unhappy,but. I guess I ...I didn't know to what extent. You don't write much down,do you,mr.Landry? I do not. I keep most of it up here. This ... this notebook'sjust a crutch. Sort of likea security blanket,huh? I think I've taken upenough of your time. Sorry I'm the bearerof bad news. That's all right. I just assumed your husband would have told youall about it. You talked to my husband? Well,of course. Best friend missing and all ...

I don't want to bore youwith all that,okay? Let your staff take a lookat that later. Point here is,sure,I can do the work. Every guy who comes in herecan do the work,right? I mean,we wouldn't be up hereif we couldn't do it. But here's what makes medifferent ... two things. Numbers ... no one beatsmy numbers,all right? They all have more overheadthan I do. They just can't do it. It's not possible. And the second thing ... energy. Look,I'm gonna be frankwith you,okay? These other guys ... they ... they just won't have the passion for this project that I will. You know,to them,it's justgonna be another project on a long list of 'em. To me,no. I'm gonna sweat blood to makethis project the best it can be. So,I'm thinking reilly, if his numbers add up. Yeah,yeah.I like reilly. But I don't know the guy. And you got to work with peopleyou know,doug. I mean,I know wilkinsonis a stiff,but he's my stiff. We're going with wilkinson. And so it is written,and so it is sealed. And. 500 signatures.

Now,you gave him that $40,000 that I buried and sam found. and he took it,right? Right. What's going on? Oh,I don't know. Why do I feel likeI'm losing my mind? Hey,you rememberwhen I was 18 and we was in beaumontat the horse races? Dahlia,what the hellare you talking about? You know,I was waiting for you. I just knewyou'd show up. even though you hadall the money. You could have split on mea million different ways. I knew I could trust you. - Listen,baby ... - get off that phone,doug. You got to see this. Uh,cherien,hugh's justcome in. I got to go. What do you think? I'd use a different photo. That one makes you lookkind of insane. Gee-gee likes it. She's my campaign manager. Yeah,she's yourcampaign manager. I'm your turd blossom. Change the frickin' photo. Hey,have you ever heardof leadership council? Yeah,me neither. I guess it's someafter-school committee. It's meeting today. They need a president. I mean,the guy wants me to run for president of something. It's just ... it's hard to takeseriously,I guess. Well,you're smart. You deserve it. Thanks. Good luck at your audition,all right? Thanks. I'm gonna be in the chapeljust studying, so come get mewhen you're done. Go. Mr.Rich,got a moment? Oh,sure. Well,it seemed to me like you liked my presentation. So I was just wondering why I didn't get the job. I'm sorry. There were a lotof qualified applicants, and,um,it was a reallydifficult decision. Why would you hire someone who bid higher than me? Look,you weren't hired, so suck it upand get out of my way. And a fellow irishmanon top of it. I'm not irish. I'm jewish. You don't look jewish to me. You look irish. Uh,we're gonna start in afew, so enjoy your last cookie. Remember,you needto sign up today if you want to runfor president. Another reminder ... we do a newcomer c&c celebration every third friday of the month. So if you want to come, raiseyour hand so I can get a count. Sounds good. Yes. Oh,did you get a t-shirt? No,I ... I didn't knowthere were t-shirts. Cool & celibate. Are you serious? I mean,are you truly serious? Because. sometimes I think no oneis as serious as I am about "no sex. This is not a joke. You can't be half a virgin. You're either a virginor a slut. So,you all know each other? I get it ...it's a family project. Interesting. So now that you get the picture, when do I start the job? We can talk about this later. Just let me handle it. Oh,no. Let me handle it. Let me tell you a story. Before I got taken inby travelers, I lived in an orphanage. And,uh,one night,there was a fire. When I woke up,smoke everywhere, heat,people screaming,burning alive. We all just ran,jumped out of windows, did whatever we neededto get out. But this one kid ...he'd been hiding his money in the hole in the floor. He was clawing at the floor, trying to get the money. And I told him,"get out while you can! He didn't listen. And now I'm telling youthe same thing. Get out while you can. 'cause I set the fire. I already had his money. Oh,and,uh,dale,you're fired. Funny,funny,funny,doug. Why don't you justcome on back here and we can talk about it? Don't worry about that. I'll take care of it. He's just puttingon a show. You're full of it. You lied to usfor the last time. What a day.
