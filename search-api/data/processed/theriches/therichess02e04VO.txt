- You can't bribe Pete. - I have to try. What did you do with Pete? You killed him. I hit him, and then. But he fought back. You smashed his skull in with a hammer! - And I feel real bad about that. - What if someone comes looking for him? - You said he didn't have any friends. - He's got a mother. - I didn't think about his mother. - What happened to Pete? - Did he take the money? - He's fine. Everything's all right. - Pete went home. Look at this. Bayou hills. It's the deal of a lifetime. $150 million, and you cash in on $13 million. $13 million? All we got to do is be the Riches for a few months, the deal closes, we cash in, check out, and adios. Just like any other con. - What have you got for me? - Malloy wrapped around my little finger. Bollocks. Wayne Malloy would never give you that job. He's not stupid. I want you to tell Wayne to get me a job at Panco, or you're going back to prison. That's our new mail boy? Guess so. I'm scared all the time. - Of what, darling? - I don't know. I just got a feeling something bad's gonna happen. Holy mother of shit. It's Eamon Quinn. - I think you ought to leave. - Little Ginny Dannegan. It's my fault that Dale can do this to us. I'm Dahlia Malloy. And... I'm a parole violator. You heard I was cool? - Mark said you were cool. - Mark who? Mark from the A.A. Mark from the A-A? He said that you understand how life can get real complicated. And, see, my life is real complicated. I didn't check in with my parole Officer before I left Alabama. You got out of jail when? Three months ago. But I wanted to get in touch with him. I did. My husband, he's a drinker, and he left me when I was in jail, and he took my kids. And... I've been looking for him ever since here in Louisiana. And I was desperate because my son. He's... he takes a medication that my husband doesn't accept. He's in denial that my child is very, very sick, - that he has... - He has cancer. He has he has a real rare blood disease. It's... when your immune system turns on your blood. Called? - I'm so sick of the bullshit. - It's called hemoblastinoma! - Clark! - No! Come on. - It's called... - Parole violator. Outstanding warrant. You can't do this! I'm honest! I came here of my own free will. You can't do this to me. I want a lawyer. You do, now? For what? So he can look up hemoblastinoma? The one thing I hate is when somebody looks me in the eye and bullshits me. Because it disrespects me. - I didn't mean no disrespect. - Don't even start! I wish one you people have the guts to look me in the eye and say, "You know what? I screwed up!" "Not because my kid was sick or my mother was dying, but because I'm a lowlife and screwing up is what I do!" - "And I'm sorry." - I am sorry! It's just what I am. I wanted to tell you the truth. I swear to god, on Jesus on the cross. I wanted to tell you the truth. I was just scared to. I just want a chance... to change my life. And I want to stop lying. It's really damn hard to stop lying. And it just it eats up your soul, and it destroys you, and it destroys everyone around you who you love. You got 24 hours, What's it? 6:42. You got till 6:42 tomorrow to get your skinny ass a real job, real place to live with written proof and references I can visit in person. If you can show up with that job for a month...

Transcript : www.swsub.com Synch: AkaZab, Flolo, jayson.sosweet Roughly 8% of the 3,000 public-school teachers in St. Tammany parish</i> leave every year, so hiring 250 to 300 new teachers is quite routine. But this year the parish has a few critical needs.</i> Dahlia, you are a moron. Gentlemen, this is... ... people for this opportunity... ...considering our relationship with the mayor's office...</i> - You scared the shit out of me. - I got to talk to you. I didn't hear you come in last night. I was at Hugh's until almost 1:00. He's getting ready for that investors'meeting? And he kind of... He thinks that Gigi stole his mojo. I have to try and talk him into the idea that his mojo is actually in the deal. I thought they had investors for like $150 million. Out on the golf course. Apparently they haven't signed yet, So I was up all night trying to memorize 55 pages of real-estate bullshit. I got to go in early so Aubrey can drill me on the growth-and-conservation act of 2006. I got to talk to you. I did something stupid. It came from a good place, so I think you'll understand, but I'm just... This parole thing is just hanging over my head, and I've been thinking I'm sick of being scared. There's nothing to be scared of. Can we talk when we get to work? No, I got to talk about it now. I'm not going to work today. You're going to work today early in case something goes wrong. - What? - This is the setup to the whole deal. We need to do this together, and I can't do it without you. There's a security guard out front. He's real pissed off about Cal's tent and fire. What? I need to talk to you. What the hell is going on? I'm sorry but unauthorized bonfires are prohibited by homeowner's association. Cal, what's with the tent? He doesn't want to live in the house anymore. I'm talking to you, Cal. Why are you living in a tent in the yard? He thinks the house is stealing our souls. It's just that rule five of the homeowner's code, prohibits unsightly yard structures. You see? You're breaking rule five. Take down the tent. Holy shit. He's obeying rule five. Take the tent down. I am about to nail the biggest deal of my life, and I do not need this shit 'cause I'm working my ass off, I've put everything on the line for this family. Thanks, Cap'n Crunch. We got it from here. What is your problem? Haven't you caused enough trouble around here? The world does not revolve around you! Just the man I was looking for. You were right, Doug. I got in bed last night, and I did not get in bed alone. Hey there, sugar tits. Built like a brick shit house. Got in bed with this smoking-hot deal memo. So, the deal talked to you? $150 million. You were so right. I started to think about just how big a number $150 million really is. Felt some action right in my pants. Nothing makes you hard like knowing you're about to gross more money the GDP of half a dozen shit-bag African countries. Am I right? - Just like you said, Doug. - I never said that. Nobody steals my mojo. You do your due diligence on our investors? I did, and I'm a little worried about Minkov. Why? He's in for $40 million. Exactly he goes squirrelly and bails on us, we're up shit's creek. He's not gonna bail. His goddamn ambulance company is being investigated - for misuse of medicare funds. - Which I'm also a little worried about. He could be laundering money. - So? - So, I'm just saying he's Russian. When we get in there, don't go all Hugh on him. Don't go all Hugh on him? What the hell is that supposed to mean? That means don't piss him off. Why would I piss him off? His money's real, and he needs us. The ambulance company got a lot of bad press. They dumped some homeless lady out on the street. That's great. We'll pitch him that this deal will be great press for him, because we're gonna revitalize the community, create jobs, growth, opportunity. - He'll be a local hero. - That's good. Mr. Minkov is here. He'd like to see you before the meeting.</i> All right. Come on. Let's go put the screws to that Russki mother. Let's see what we have here. So, you've been convicted of a felony? It was just a white-collar thing. I did some time. It was just two years in jail. Should I not have checked that? I wanted to be honest and up front with y'all 'cause my parole officer will be calling and... Is it gonna be a problem? It's just... My boss kind of has a bug up his ass about criminals. I'm not a criminal. I've been rehabilitated. He worries y'all might relapse near the cash register. How am I supposed to live an honest life if the minute I'm honest on an application, you won't hire me?! Sorry. You know what? I don't want to work here anyhow. Know why? 'Cause your macchiato's got too much goddamn foam in it! There he is. Felix, you son of a bitch. You give me the tongue, I'll wring your neck. You, never stop being an asshole. Please. Felix, I want you to meet my partner, Doug Rich. Pleasure. I heard so much of the famous Doug Rich. I wouldn't believe everything that Hugh tells you. Hugh nah. No my partner, Barry Stone. He's stuck in traffic. He's gonna be here any minute. Barry Stone? Yeah. Barry Stone. Where on earth... Princeton. - Princeton. class of '85. - Oh, my god. Class of'85, oh, my god, Barry Stone. All right. Let's get this thing started. Small world, isn't it? What you doing? Nothing. - Why aren't you at school? - I came home. I'm dropping out, too, I decided. Don't be an idiot. You love school. You love, having friends and, studying, those stupid standardized tests. I'm not letting you leave. Let's just go somewhere. Except we don't have any money. Let's bump into some housewives at the mall, make a couple hundred bucks easy. Yeah, I guess. I just, don't want to steal. That's okay. We'll do a Molly Brannigan. You always loved doing Molly Brannigans. In Edenfalls? in Edenfalls at the mall. What do you mean I'm not in keeping with your corporate image? Juggs is a very specific brand. Thanks, Erin. But the Juggs girl is wholesome and all-american. She's bubbly and outgoing. She's the cowgirl next door, and the, hardened, convicted felon is way off brand. I'm not a hardened, convicted felon. I'm the cowgirl next door. Not according to this. I committed one crime, one. I stole some money on a fake piece of plastic, I did my time, and you're telling me that I'm not good enough to flash my tits at some moron eating a hamburger? - <i>Where are you?</i> - I'm coming in! - Would you keep your hair on? - We got a situation. One of these guys went to Princeton with Doug Rich, and he's on his way here. Wait. I got to talk to you. I got a serious problem. No. I've got a serious problem. I've called Sammy, and he's going through Doug's stuff, see if he can find anything on this guy. But I need you to be here to distract him long enough till I can figure out who he is. I'll be in in 10 minutes. I thought you said you were on the inside. I am in. I'm in the nerve center. So, where's Wayne Malloy? You said you were gonna bring him to me. I am. I am all over his ass. But you can't even get him to a goddamn meeting. It's a very high-level meeting with billionaires and such. You know what I hate, Dale? When somebody feeds me a line of shit. All right. I'll pull a few strings. I'll get in. I'm in the loop. As we all know, in 2005, Hurricane Katrina laid wast to the great city of New Orleans. Whole parts of the city are still in ruins. Now it's time to rebuild. - Want to talk about our vision, Doug? - Absolutely. So, what we are planning is a development that will be a tribute to its Louisiana heritage. Not just houses and a golf course, but an actual town center that will be an exact replica - of the French quarter. - Except not in New Orleans. Exactly. We are making a new, New Orleans, right here in Duquesne. It will be called bayou hills 200 acres, of brand-new houses - starting at $1.2 million. - Excuse me, Doug. You cleared up the problems with the zoning permits, right? 100%, Felix. We got clearance to build on a former state park. Pristine real estate. All we had to do is make 10% of the homes affordable housing for the Katrina refugees. Obviously, they'll have their own parks and pools. The point is we are helping people here restart their lives. We're not just making money. We are revitalizing an entire community. It's Barry. Excellent. I have some legal documents that I like everyone just to check out. They're on my desk. I will just get them. I'll be right back for Barry. Excuse me one second, gentleman. Thank you. I'm very sorry. I'm dead. He's coming in. The guy from Princeton. How well will he know Doug? Let's hope it was a big class. I got to talk to you about something. I'm in kind of a situation, and I got to find another job. What? I know it sounds bad, but I'm really trying to get us out from underneath this thing. If I just get clear of this parole - violation... - You crazy? With the biggest deal in our lives about to blow up in our faces? You better focus here. This guy can bring us both down, all right? 1,760,000 entries for Barry Stone. Sammy, give your mom everything you got on Barry Stone. I can't find anything. What about a yearbook? I don't see one. What about a newspaper, like a Princeton newspaper? Keep looking. What the freakin'goddamn hell are you doing? Minkov's reaming my ass in legal technicalities, and Barry Stone is gonna lose his shit if he doesn't see his old friend, Doug. Get your ass in there and reconnect. Here's the Doug-meister. My god. You look completely different. I'd have never recognized you. Oh, my god. We must be getting old. River of life, man. I might have lost a few hairs, put on a couple of pounds of... You do not at all, - look like you used to look. - No. - Didn't you used to be kind of... - It's a rug, man. Be cool. So, I'm not completely senile, then? I remember you, 'cause you... The police got you. I do not believe you have the gall to bring that up. How was I supposed to know she was just 15? No one knew. It was she looked 40. At least I wasn't known as the campus coke dealer. No, you weren't. I was. This is boring the shit out of everyone, so... It's good to see you again. Excellent. On with the deal, gentlemen. Rock'n roll. Onward. Let's do the deal, gentlemen. She wasn't 15, she was... she was... 18.</i> Absolutely. I've got no problem with raw fish. There is one thing that I should tell you that I should clear up. In the recent past, I was convicted of a crime, and I had to spend some... Then you know how it is. Thank you. Thank you, Travis. That's great. I can come by to... Now isn't such a good time. No, my personal life's not gonna be a problem. No. I promise. No. I'll be there right away. So, that about covers financing. Are there any questions? I would like to know exactly why these deal papers make no mention of applying for CDBGs or USEDAs. Doug, it's your arena. Yes. Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen, but I thought you'd be interested to know that we have fresh-brewed coffee available in the coffee room. Thank you, Dale. You may go. But it is an excellent idea. Is that the handyman? Yes, he's part of our program for hiring people of little worth, and wherewithal. He's... right, though. There's coffee there, so if we want to break, we can, get nice brewed coffee with a little roast. Yes. CDGBs... I'd like an explanation, please. Yes. I think that's important. I am so sorry. Someone's calling me. Terrible. CDGBs... They don't apply to parkland. We can't, make applications. It's a community-development block grant can only apply to preexisting communities that, - I think you'll find. - What about an H.A.P.? You're putting me through my paces now. H.A.P.S... They are a different kettle of fish 'cause you've got to be a... 501, as you'll know. 501... what? What the hell does that mean? What does it mean? Sounds like a pair of jeans. But it, in fact is, a registered nonprofit... Not us. You're not a lawyer, are you? No... I'm not a lawyer. - <i>You</i>'re a lawyer. - No... yes, I am. But I know people who aren't. Wait. You don't cut the head off first. You cut the fin out first. And then you rip the guts out. - I thought you said you knew fish. - I do. I find it easier if I cut the head off first to, get to the guts. You cut the head off first, the whole fish falls apart. Here. - Don't screw up. - I won't. I swear. You've done some time? It was just a white-collar thing... Just two years. It was maximum-security prison, very overcrowded, a lot of fights. As a matter of fact, I knocked somebody's teeth out once with a cafeteria tray. Been there, done that. You can have the graveyard shift... 6:00 to midnight. No benefits, no overtime. You don't show up you're fired, you call in sick you're fired, you come late you're fired. - You live near here? - I'm looking for a place. There's a vacancy in my building. - Guy down the hall from me passed. - You probably whacked him. Why don't you just shut your mouth? All right? Disrespectful mother... I'm trying to help the lady out here. Welcome to the team. Ma'am, did you never hear of pretty Molly Brannigan truth is she left me</i> I'll never be a man again not a touch on me hide</i> will the summer sun e'er tan again 'cause Molly's left me alone to die. Thank you. Just don't make eye contact. Oh, my god. This is so sad. They're begging. Thanks, bitch. I'm a little concerned about our tax liability once the section 8 housing is eliminated. That's a nonissue. We're not gonna eliminate the affordable housing. - Let's cut the bullshit, okay? - This is not bullshit. The city would never give us public land unless we make 10% of it affordable housing. - 15% of our funding is from FEMA. - I know. I read the deal memo, but we had a verbal understanding, right? What Verbal understanding? Nobody paying $1 million for a house is gonna want to live near poor people. The low-income housing will have its own area. Stop the bullshit. I could show you the blueprints. I might have forgotten to mention a minor detail, which is that you're right, Felix. We had a verbal agreement that the construction will go in three phases. Phase one... we build the luxury homes. Phase two... we sell all the luxury homes. And then the... rich phase-two homeowners band together and, rule out phase three. So actually phase three never happens, 'cause you're right, Felix. Nobody's gonna pay a million bucks to live cheek by jowl with the phase-three element. You did kind of forget to mention that. The city will be yelling and screaming. There'll be lawsuits up the wazoo, but, our legal team will handle that, right, Doug? Just wanted to make sure we're clear on the terms of the deal. We're clear. Are we... clear on the terms of the deal? Can you... guarantee no phase three? No phase three. - Let's sign the deal. - All right! I got a couple cases of champagne on ice in the atrium. How about we crack them open? I thought you'd never ask. This guy named Chet has called for you twice. He's looking for someone named Pete Mincey. - Thanks for saving my ass in there. - You're welcome. I quit. Hang on. Just give me a couple minutes. Yes. I know. I had problems passing the bar exam. I don't give a shit that you're not a lawyer. I figured that out a long time ago, but I didn't care. I liked you. In this whole crazy sick place, you were the only person who seemed real. If it's any consolation, my son thinks I'm an asshole, too. Do you even get what just happened in that meeting? This is fraud, Doug... Or Wayne, or whatever the hell you call yourself. And you were using the tragedy of thousands of people as a cheap trick to make money. And then you're screwing those people. We're not screwing them. We will build the affordable housing. - Don't bullshit me, Wayne! - I'm not bullshitting you. We're bullshitting the investors. That's what you do in a deal. You say whatever you want to say in order to close the deal, and then you do what you wanted to do in the first place. That's sales. That's what you do. You know that. Why should I believe you? 'Cause if I don't build it, then you can turn me over to the cops... And because, I need to believe me. Better come to the party before Hugh drinks all the champagne. $40, $60, $61, $62, $63, $64, $65... $65. Probably get to $100 if you stop eating those $5 frozen yogurts. You don't want to do this anymore. Let's get something to eat. No. I do. I want to. Come on. Like I care what those buffer assholes think. You never used to. Shit, Di. Come on. I can't do this anymore. - It's okay. - No, it's not. I want it to be like it always was. - It can be. - No, Cal. It can't. Why not? 'Cause I hate it here? 'Cause I like it. I got an English paper due tomorrow. I got to go home, so... Let's not do goodbyes, all right? I hate goodbyes. It's not like I'm not gonna see you again. He O.D.'d? Right there on the barcalounger. Was watching "Survivor"... Kind of a, cruel twist of fate if you ask me. You can keep the chair if you want, and the toaster oven, too. But I hope you heard me loud and clear. - No turning tricks here. - I told you I'm not a hooker. I'm not here to judge. I just don't want no trouble. Ain't gonna be no trouble. My application. License. Dahlia Malloy... That's a real pretty name. I always thought so. I hope you're happy here, Dahlia Malloy. Lance was. Maybe that was just the crack talking? What makes you hard? - What? - What turns you on? What floats your boat? Hookers? Cars? Underage girls? Drink up. Drink up, there. Look at all this Champagne I got here. Come on. It's beautiful. Just a second. Hugh's having fun, huh? Hugh likes money. You will cut him out of the deal. What? You'll be so betrayed when you find out he's been embezzling. What the hell are you talking about? Relax, Doug. Relax. After he goes to jail, you and I will split the profits. Just after we, sprout wings and fly to the moon. Got it. Or... Maybe I should rip off... ... your goddamn rug. Oh, my god. That's a very high-quality toupee you've got here. You Americans make the best... fakes... ever. You think I couldn't tell you never went to Princeton, you prick? My partner may be stupid, but I'm not. I don't give shit who you really are. For me, you're a guy who knows how to make money, like me. So you'll set him up, and we'll split the profits. It's a win-win, okay? Except for Hugh? I'll take that as a yes. This is Dale Malloy. Quinn said you'd be expecting my call. If we're gonna bring your man in, I got the numbers you need. All right. This is officer Devereaux, leave a message.</i> Hi, officer Devereaux. This is Dahlia Malloy. I'm... just leaving you this message 'cause it's, 6:30 and so you don't have to put out that warrant for my arrest, because I'm working in the kitchen at Rudi and Flo's fish shack, and I'm living at 206 Mayfield, apartment 5e. That's all true. I guess I'll be hearing from you. Where the hell are you? Thank god. Listen, you know I told you about the... my friend who knew the parole officer? It's great because... For the love of god, do not tell me that you've been talking to your parole officer. No, I'm... I just think if we could do, one honest thing, just... one thing that we know is true, Wayne... Parole is the tip of the iceberg, here. You know that. We are committing a list of crimes here as long as my goddamn arm. We do not want to involve the law. Right. How was your day? Fine. Dale is worming his way into all the meetings. Hugh is drunk off his ass. And I just screwed a whole bunch of Katrina victims out of their future. I love you. I love you, too. You should know I have backing from powerful forces. What I'm saying is you will not survive. "'and haven't you your own land to visit,' continued Miss Ivors, that you know nothing of your own people, and your own country?'" What in the hell is that supposed to mean? It's from "The dead" by Joyce. You've never heard of Joyce? Of course I have. She's one of my favorite writers. You got to get educated, Ginny. That's how they keep you down. Like you ever been to third grade. Bachelor of arts in English literature, masters in philosophy, university of Phoenix. You never been to Phoenix. Phoenix come to me right there in the state pen. Such is the power of the Internet. It's a new world. We are living in a skeptical and, if I may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age. It's beautiful. It's about how we've lost our souls. You feel that, don't you... That emptiness... Right here? - I thought you were with Cal.
