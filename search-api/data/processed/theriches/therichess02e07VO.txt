He discovered his passion late in life. But when he did, he committed to it with all his heart and soul. There are no words to describe my love for this fine man. But I would be doing him a great disservice were I not to mention the generosity of spirit, the exemplary christian forgiveness that nina has shown to both of us. Nina, would you like to say a few words? I was married to jim for... for 25 years. And I'm sure most of you are wondering how I could be married to a gay man for that long without knowing it. Well, guess what. It's none of your goddamn business! Nina. Friends? Amongst friends? I don't know any of you people! If this whole thing had been up to me, jim would have been cremated and stuck in a closet somewhere! Do you think I would have had any of this? I hate funerals! I hate funerals!

To passing bird, but I am dumb from human dignity. What's that supposed to mean? I'm not sure. It's from a book that quinn loaned me. I like the way it sounded, especially the "shrieking my heart's agony" part. What do you think it means? It should mean whatever you want it to. I want it to mean someone thinks I'm smart enough to figure it out. That I'm not just some dumb trailer trash. You're not. Is it true? Baby. So this is who we are? Di di. Di di. What?
