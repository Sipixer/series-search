Some call us gypsies, others call us thieves,</i> most though, don't even know we exist.</i> I've got three kids, a boy, a girl, and, uh... My wife Dahlia is just out of jail, on parole. We took her home to the traveler camp.</i> The family gave her a warm welcome.</i> I, on the other hand, got a different type of welcome.</i> I am the new boss. He is the old boss. Get over it. Sometimes, it takes a beating to make you realize it's time to move on.</i> So where are we gonna go? Life's a river, kid. You gotta go where it takes you. So, with a loan from the family bank, I packed up the RV and went out in search of something better. - Shit! - It wasn't</i> that long before the family tried to stop us.</i> You're in the wrong lane, asshole! Mick, look out! Shit! Stop! Unfortunately, they stopped someone else instead, and then they ran. She's breathing.

That's not even funny. I got 12 mouths to feed. What you mean, all these kids are yours? Of course, they're mine. Adopted from every corner of the world. This one's got a heart of gold. Her name's, Chi Ho. You wanna get started on this? All this. Right. This is a school ? This is a private school, honey. It's an academy. I gotta get this done fast. I got a conference call at 3:00. Shit, look, he snuck them on. Sammy, Sammy, do secret squirrel, okay ? Di, what's your name ? - My name's Delilah Rich from Tampa. - Hobbies ? Fencing, skiing, racquetball, and sex. Ow, chess. Cut the sass. Have you kids even thought about who you are ? I'm a rich jerk-off. I think we know who we are but the question is, do we really wanna go to a school that rips us off for 18 grand a year? 18 grand a year, is that a joke ? Why are you so scared of school ? My mom was scared of school, and look what happened to her. - What happened to her ? - She drowned in a creek cause she couldn't read the goddamn danger sign. "We know what we are, but not what we may be." William Shakespeare. I don't know what that means, but y'all take notes. Bonjour. Bonjour. Asseyez-vous. Répétez. Je veux. Tu veux. Il veut. Très bien. Excellent class. Maintenant, le verbe "avoir". And chess, too? Well, I'm no pro or anything, but I do play the computer. Our daughter is very gifted. You mean highly gifted ? We mean perversely gifted. That's what we got here, Jane. So what can I do for you nice people today ? Jane, we are in the scouting process at the moment, being new to Edenfalls, and our kids' education is, of course, paramount. And we're looking for the topmost educational environment for our three dangerously gifted children, - And Rosemere... - Yeah, Rosemere's it. I see. You're interested in Rosemere. - We are, Jane. - And I assume you are aware that we have an extensive waiting list. We are, Jane. The extensive waiting list, of course. We are people of means. Excuse me ? We got money. No, I know what "means" means, Mrs. Rich. Look, you should feel free to apply, and I'll be sure and let you know if we have any openings next fall. - Next fall ? - That's when our year begins. Our school is currently full, Mrs. Rich. You can make room for three little kids. Now, that really wouldn't be fair to our current parents, would it, Mrs. Rich? I mean, they thought ahead. They made our deadlines. They got their applications in on time. Now, I'm delighted to hear that your children's education is, in fact, "paramount" to you. From where I'm sitting, it doesn't really look that way. I think what you're looking for is a delightful public school in the area. Robert E. Lee. Yeah ? Well, I shit on Robert E. Lee. Baby, don't you listen to that bitch. We can go anywhere we want. Public school, private school ? What do you care ? You've never even been to a school. She can take her 18 grand and shove it up her ass. They don't just give it to you, Wayne. This american dream, they don't just give it to you with a big old ribbon and a bow. If we want it, we gotta take it. We got to do whatever it takes to get it and to hold on to it till they rip it out of our cold, dead hands. They're ain't nobody gonna tell me I don't care about my kids. There's nobody gonna say "they ain't good enough". They're not gonna let us in. Yeah, they will. Come on, Sam ! This is it. Jane Fedley. 1158 old hickory. It's quite a nice house.

Cal, do y'all wanna go to private school or not ? - No. - Well, you are. They are? Take the bags, quick. Thank you, ma'am. May I have another ? - Hurry up, will you ? - Don't you have a meeting ? Okay, if you get caught, call me. I'm a lawyer. Did I teach you anything ? Oh, my God. Cal, come here. Check out this bird. Gotta go, gotta go. Are you deaf ? What part of "hold my calls" don't you understand ? - I'm sorry. - Get it? So what happened? I put the money in, and it wouldn't come out. Couldn't pull the trigger ? You didn't seem to have a problem pulling the trigger last night. - What happened ? - That was firing a gun. Doug, listen. I'm an easy-going guy. I got three rules here at Panco : don't litter, flush the john... And make the new guy fire the old guy. Can you live with that ? - Aubrey ! - That-a-boy. Conference call in a half an hour, all right ? And get him on the phone first and don't screw up. Pronto ! Sit down. What do you think of this ? Excuse me ? What do you think of this ? Would you like to have a go at this ? I mean, would you like to take a stab at this? - At the candy bar ? - No, this, this. Not this, this. Beaufort-Simpson, right ? I am not a lawyer, Mr. Rich. Yes, but you're an expert. You know your field. You must know this like the back of your hand. Oh, so you want me to mark it up. I want you to mark it up, that's it. Just to mark it up. - I'm a paralegal. - Good. That should help. I don't wanna get blamed, and - I really, really need this job. - You will not get blamed. You're doing this for me. I just want your opinion. You want my opinion ? I'm a just man. I am a fair man. I am a woman-loving, colorblind, and powerful man. And I want your opinion. And I wanna give you this candy bar as well... for the job. Are you gonna fire him ? The man's got 12 children. Can I tell you a secret ? Those aren't his children. He cut the photos out of a catalog. No, shit. How are you doing, baby ? Well, she just sat down for a snack. So, say we got us 20, 30 minutes easy. Okay. Well, you keep your eye on her. Bye-bye.</i> Okay, my account name is Jane Fedley. She must really like Cosmo. Jones. Yeah, J-O-N...

Gotta go.</i> Y'all want the blood of my first-born too ? Just give me one moment. - Would you shut that bird up ? - Mom, I am trying, okay ? God damn it. I'm so sorry. My in-laws are in town. Well, I've lost my cell phone. And I just wondered if you could suspend my service for a couple of days just to see if it shows up. Well, thank you so much. I love them shoes. Baby, come here. Now, you gotta make a choice. What do you mean ? Right now. For the con. See, when you rope that Fedley woman, you can be a girl, but then, see, you gotta stay a girl. Or you can be a boy. It might be easier. I gotta make a choice? Not for me, not ever. I love you, just like you are. But, yeah, you gotta make a choice. For them. You wanna go to that school, right ? I swear to God, that this bird, if it says it one more time, I'm gonna cook him. Of all things that we had to steal, we had to steal a goddamn parrot ? - It's not funny. - Gotta go.

Next time chime in. That's what you're here for, isn't it? Let's talk about Panco, Stu. Hey, you know what? Let's talk about your lack of participation on that conference call. No, forget about that. Tell me about Beaufort Simpson. Are we winning or loosing? I couldn't tell on my conference call. Okay, let's play again. I'm gonna read a paragraphe on the Beaufort-Simpson file, and you tell me what it means, okay ? Here we go. "The provision of law, R.C.19, "which prohibitsa court from enjoining "the yada-yada-yada-yada, violates the separation-of-powers doctrine and is therefore unconstitutional. What the hell does that mean? What kind of lawyer are you? No, just imagine I know nothing about the law. Okay, just imagine I just come straight out the far-west. I'm a kid from the swamps, and I'm here and, whoa. Just help me out here. "Eminent Domain" Now what's that? I saw it in a film. - "Eminent Domain"? - Yeah, is it important? Jesus Christ! Where did you go to school man? You have to be the worst lawyer in the world. I am... I am the worst lawyer in the world. And you... You are the best liar in the world. Your family?

Come here, little chou-chou. See, this is how the world ends, not with a bang, but with a wimper. Oh Jane, honey, don't be so negative. The thing about birds is you think they care but... all they really want is food. Maybe I should go. - Look over there, here or something. - Yeah, go look that way. Yeah, hurry, hurry. Don't be sad, Jane. You keep doing that bird call. - Hey, I'm not late, am I? - Just give me the bird. Okay, tell "over here". Over here! Okay, take the bird. - Come on, just-- - Okay, go, go. I found him. Take care, Ms. Fedley. Bonsoir. Come here you. And best of luck this bird, it really is a very good school. - Thank you. - Yeah... It is an hour away but... You know, if you don't stand for education, hell, what do you stand for ? - Mrs Riche. - Oh, call me Shereen. I want to repay you, how can I repay you for this great kindness? Oh, there's nothing you can do, Jane. We're not the kind of people who need to be repaid, are we? Sometimes life's not about payments, or meeting deadlines, playing by the rules. You know, our life is just... It comes right out and it hits you. And before you know it, you got a missing child and a missing bird. We know what we are, but not what we may be. Right? Bye, Jane. Au revoir. Huh... Have you got a minute? Mom still got it, huh? Why sure, Jane. Better be a rental. Never trust a thief with a gold card, baby. I've missed you. I've missed you too. - And how was your day been? - Good. I think I'm getting a hangover. I think you are too. - I got the kids into Rosemere. - Oh yeah? Eighteen grand times three, how much is that? That's a lot of money, Wayne. Well, I've been a crack open some law books. See if I can keep this job. You think it's gonna rain? I hope not. Never mind.
