You want to wear his suits, and you want me to be his dead wife? Do you really think dad has a plan? He stole the money, ma lost the money, and now we're here in a dead guy's house. Y'all aren't in the witness protection program, are you? 'cause I've been thinking about it, and it just doesn't quite make sense. I don't want to put you on the spot. What is going on? You're my friend, Nina. I would never lie to you about that. I went to taos, did some spirit shit, cleaned myself right out. - And there you met, uh... - That's Geegee, and she's a dancer. A miracle happened. I fell in love, and I married her. We have a lot to talk about, my friend. Dad, we have to do somethin'. Dale came here for us. He's not goin' anywhere. Dale seems to have been here for a while now. He could've blown our cover at any point, and he didn't. - Why is that? - He's Dale. He's workin' an angle. I don't know. Doug is a republican. His best friend is Pete. Pete's a mortgage broker from dallas. He's e-mailed twice about a golf trip. Hi. Is, uh, Doug here? Doug who? Guess you're probably surprised to see me here, Wayne. You and I both know you're not Doug Rich, though everyone here seems to think you are. Who are you? And where the hell is my best friend Doug Rich? Who are you? Look, don't get upset. I thought you were my guardian angel. There's a rational explanation for all of this. Hey, there, little fella. Come on, davey, quit playin' around. - Is that a real gun? - Is it? Where's Doug?! There you are. Now, what's all this I hear about you shootin' folks with guns? Now, you go back to my office and wait till I get there. Don't go postal on me now. Oh! Got you where it counts. Well, he's a good kid, really. - Who the hell is he? - He's geegee's. It's a long story. Hugh Panetta. Hugh Panetta, Pete Mintzy, an old friend. He's a little depressed, a little unstable. Seems like a freak. Good luck. - I'm not your friend. - I understand how you feel. You fraud. You told me you were a shrink. - I wanted to help you. - I don't want your help. I want Doug. All right. Can you just give me 30 seconds? - Are you out of your freakin' mind? - I gotta clean myself up. It looks like someone's hit me with a bat, for God's sakes. Just wait. I'll be right here. Baby, I'll be there soon. - Nina just came over for some tea and - Pete's here. He knows. Skaal krush. Skaal krush. Skaal krush. I am not some jackass you can all push around. I'm not waiting on any... What's wrong with this guy? I got a kid here! He doesn't need to hear this shit! It's all right. I'm... It's under control. Do you want to know who I am? Don't give me that montpierre shit, or I will go in there and tell everyone you're an impostor. I'm gene. Gene morrongiello. I'm a lawyer, just like Doug. He contacted me a few months ago. He asked me to do this. - He asked you to pretend to be him? - Yes! I know how it sounds. Go do his job, live in his house. I had a million questions, but he paid me to keep those questions to myself. - Why? - I don't know. Pete, I just don't know. Life is a mystery. But what it comes down to, was that a man, a human being, need help. Prove it. Which part? How do I know you're gene moron... Or whatever your name is? - I need to talk to him. - I don't know where he is. - You said you knew! - I mean metaphysically. - I know where he's at. - You're lying. You know where he is, and you're not telling me. Either that, or something's wrong, and I better call the police. Jesus, Pete, I'm not supposed to tell you this. Doug told me not to. He's in hiding. I don't know where he is, but I know how to contact him. and I will take you to him. ~ SeriesSub.com ~ present Transcript: swsub.com Synchro: Ricana & Synchro: [Yossarian, sheva85] from Synchro: ::ItalianSubAddicted:: Synchro: Season 01 Episode 13 Waiting for Dogot Get your brother and sister and get out. Pete's back. Skaal krush. - What are you holdin' there, Dahlia? - Oh, nothin'. - Shit. I'm sorry, Nina. - Honey, I don't need your "sorry." doesn't take a rocket scientist to know somethin's up. Look me in the eye and tell me what it is. - I can't. - Are you in trouble? - Well, let me help. - You can't, okay? Best thing you can do is just walk out the door right now and pretend like you don't know me. Pretend... Everything's all right. All right? Nina, I love you. Get out. - Which is your car? You can follow me. - What do you take me for, - a complete idiot? I'm going with you. - I'm just trying to be helpful. Why do we have to go back to your house anyway? Why can't we call Doug now? That is the important question. I've got to make the call from the home phone. If I don't, it's a signal to Doug that there is a problem. If I leave a coded message for Doug from my home phone, he will know it is clear, and he will call me back, okay? And then I can talk to him? That's the other important question. Doug expressly wished - that no one talk to him on the phone in case it's tapped. - Forget this. I'm going to the police. No, don't freak out on me here because then we go and meet him. That's what you wanted to look him in the eye. That's what you said. Gene, there's somethin' about you. Jesus Christ! What the hell?! I am so sorry about that. That's not a problem, sir, don't worry about it. No problem? I scraped up your whole rear end. - Just get his insurance information. - Listen to the man. I'm Greg, Greg Buffer. How you doin' there? How's your neck? We gotta go, Greg, so, uh, - don't worry about the damages. - Well, I can't let you go without payin' you for that rear end. That would be un-american. - Oh, darn it. I thought I had some cash. - I said it'll be all right. Jeez, your associate's a little uppity here. Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm a handyman by trade. How about I come over, take a gander at your house, and we'll see how I can help. We'll barter, know what I mean? Well, we're in a bit of a hurry here. Now is not a good time. Well, then, I will come by tonight, and we'll work out our arrangement here. - I'll take a bottled mochaccino. - Maybe later, mama. - Ain't you sleepy? It's time for your nap. - I'm thirsty. - I made some calls. - Well, there's water in your room. - Hello! - I'm thirsty! Jesus, mama! Louise? - We have a visitor. - Well, what happened to you there, sweetheart? Pete knows everything. - He knows everything? - I mean, the whole arrangement. - Our whole arrangement. - Whole enchilada, everything. I mean, I told him Doug gave us specific instructions he's not to be contacted, ever, by anyone. Great. Way to go, Gene. Louise, the man was understandably about to contact the police. It is okay. I understand. He wanted to see his friend. He loves his friend. It is understandable, and, - Pete, honey, we're on your side. - You tricked me. - You toyed with me. You were never on my side. - Yeah. Go get the number, please. Pete, sweetheart, I'm so sorry we lied to you, okay? I know you're stressed, and what you need is a beer. - I don't drink beer. - What you need is a wine cooler, okay? - I was just... - You don't have to explain. I know you don't trust us, and I wouldn't trust us, either. - It's real tasty. - I like... I like raspberry. Yeah, well, we only got wild berry mist. - Go ahead. It's good. - Come on, Pete, you don't want any of that wild berry shit. - Yeah, I don't care. - I'll fix you a glenlivet. I said, I don't give a shit! Now, find the number and call my friend! Okay, Pete, I have the number. Phone's just charging up an extra couple of minutes. Won't take me any longer to make you a drink. - Why is this always your plan? - Because it works. He would be out for a couple of hours, which would give us enough time to grab our shit, cover our tracks, and get the hell out of here. We are not giving up. We are not cutting and running. Oh, yeah? What are you proposing? I have another plan. What is it? What is your plan? It's developing now. It's germinating. Just... I can cool this guy. You give me enough time, I can cool him. - Don't go for the roofie yet. - Wayne, he wants to see his friend. He wants to see dead Doug. How are you gonna give him that? - Phone's ready! - I don't need the blow-by-blow. Yes, you do. You need to absolutely understand what is gonna happen here. I am gonna call into a voicemail system. You cannot talk. You cannot make a sound. If he even suspects that someone else is in the room, he will not call back. He will not make contact with us. Do you understand? There's an important set of rules that have to happen here. Now, can you do this? Now, there is a code. The code is a song... that I must sing into the phone. It's what Doug wanted. Absolute silence. I will make the call. aaaaaa-mazing grace... how sweet the sound... that saved a wretch like meeee... I once was lost... but now am found... was blind, but now can see... What happens now? Now we wait. So how long do we wait? How long does it take for Doug to, - you know... - Make contact? Well, it depends. 'cause one time, it only took him an hour to call us back. Right, honey? True, though, another time, he almost took two days. Look, I like you guys. I'm a trusting person. It's my nature. I mean, I'm a messed-up person, but I... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't say that about yourself. You're not a messed-up per... We're all messed up. Well, what's wrong with being trusting? I, myself, am the exact same way. Now, Gene here, he doesn't trust a soul. You tell me somethin', you open your heart to me, I'm right there. You and me are a lot alike, Pete. So... how long do we wait? It's like when you love someone, and you... go out on a limb with them, and then, they take you to heaven, or they take you to hell... - And sometimes you can't tell the difference. - Yeah... but how long do we wait?! We don't know, Pete. Your guess is as good as ours. If he doesn't make contact tonight, I'm calling the authorities. If he doesn't call tonight, I'm calling the authorities, and we will get them to call you. - Call me? - At your hotel. Oh, Pete's not goin' anywhere, Gene. No, Pete's here till the bitter end. Ain't you, Pete? - Are you hungry, Pete? - As a matter of fact, I am, Louise. Well, okay. Do you play scrabble? I... don't. Hey, why are you foldin' those? We're not even taking 'em. - It's important, Cal. - What's important? How we leave things behind. Hey, Sam, what are you doin'? We need your help. - I have to finish my homework. - Sam, this is it, okay? Skaal krush. I'm not going anywhere. I'm a conscientious objector. You're a what? You don't get to be a conscientious objector. You didn't talk to him about this yet, did you? I can't do it, Cal. I mean, look, he works on this thing every single day. - You have to talk to him. - We can't leave this here. We have to paint over it. He's not gonna listen to me. - I need your help. - It's gonna crush him, Cal. We don't have a choice. You don't know that. I mean, there's still hope. Dad's got a plan. No, there is no plan. He has no plan. He just finished singing "amazing grace" to a dead guy and as far as I get it, we're now waiting for the dead guy to call us back. - Mom knows what's going on. - Mom's got a fridge full of roofies, d. Come on, how sophisticated a plan is that? What in this situation is hopeful, Di? I have a right to hope, Cal. You can't take that away from me. - Biscuit? - I don't like biscuits. Louise, the man doesn't like biscuits. Do we have any bread or crackers? I don't eat carbs. I'm on a diet. I usually just have a protein shake. I guess I should've told you that. What about just havin' some mac and cheese? Mac and cheese? Mac and cheese, it's all carbs. Don't you know the difference between proteins and carbs? What the hell, Pete? Live a little. I would like a protein shake or some kind of protein substitute. We don't have protein substitute. This is a biscuit. Goddamn eat one. Jesus, no wonder Doug's in hiding. I made it. It's a part of me now. I'll tell you a secret, lamar. Things, people, they're around a lot longer than we think. Life takes from you. It's taking right now, yet it's still there... Underneath. I hate to wait. Sometimes, I... feel like that's all I do is wait for something that'll never come. Oh, it'll come, what we're all waitin' for. She means death, Pete. Why are you telling me death will come? I'm not waiting for death. - Well, don't take it personally. - No, no, no, but, you know, all I said was that I hate to wait, and you tell me I'm gonna die? She's putting it in perspective. Waiting's not so bad when you compare it with death, that kind of thing... Things like that. - You ever read the bible, Pete? - The bible? Yeah. Not every word, but... The bible talks a lot about waitin'. There's this one line that says, "those who wait shall inherit the earth." very famous line. Very powerful line. And I believe it to mean patience pays. I thought it was "the meek." what about the meek? Who inherit the earth. No, the meek inherit shit, Pete. The meek never inherited nothin'. You been a victim of a crime, louise? I've been victimized. Twelve times, I've been mugged in my life, which made me realize, there are two kinds of people in this world... Victims... And there are criminals. What about the people who watch? What about people who try to help? What about the people who do the cpr? - Pete, what's wrong? - People in your life... You think you'd know them. - You count on them. - I know. I know. You count on certain rules to live by, a certain order to depend upon. "how could Doug do that?" you ask yourself. "who leaves a house? Who leaves your life?" and, I mean, wherever Doug and Cherien are right now, no one knows them there. No one cares about them. Without an identity. I just miss 'em so much. Oh, shh, Pete. It's okay. Look, Pete, wherever they are, you've got to believe they're happy there. Like you can speak for Doug. People are mysterious, louise. - I think for Doug... - You don't know Doug, gene, so don't speak for him. I think for Doug, the difference between who he was and who he wanted to be was maybe more than he could bear. Pete, are you okay there, sweetheart? No. Just, um... We have a bathroom. For the love of God, Pete, go relieve yourself. I mean, what are me and louise gonna do? Hightail it up in the hills the three minutes you're in the john? We're gonna be right here, sweetheart. It's okay. You can pee. I'm so crazy. Of course, I can pee. Back, kitchen, take a right. I'll just be a minute. - What the hell are you trying to do? - It is over. I am through torturing this poor man. I'm goin' for the roofies. No, it is not over. You've got to think big here. Oh, no, no, no. I am tired of thinking big. It is time to think small. Oh, would you snap out of it? No, no, no, no, no. No, I've got it. What? What are you talkin' about? Go get Cal. Get him to dial the house phone. It's him. What did she say? I'm supposed to follow dad and be his shill. Okay, great, but what's the plan, Cal? I don't know, Di. I'm followin' orders. Well, maybe we don't have to leave, and I don't have to pull all this shit to the rv. No, don't start thinkin' like that. You remember what happened in Houston. We got to be ready to leave on a dime. Hi, there. Hi. A lot of garbage. Yeah. Yeah, we really love garbage. - It's a bad habit, I guess. - Not even garbage day. - What happened in houston? - Nothin' happened in houston, ma'am. The oil refineries. Babies. All right. Let's get this shit to the rv. - Oh, what rv? - Listen, kiddies, I've seen your rv. I know where it's parked. So I can either call security and get into this whole takin' -out-the-garbage-on-non- garbage-day business... Or I can come with you and help. Can you handle her? I got to go. Damn it, you should have let me pick up the phone. Don't you understand? We made contact. Three rings is a code. Three rings means he's ready, do you understand? Okay, you want to do this? Well, it's just... It... It's... Do you want to do this? Do you want to go and meet your friend? We're driving? You want to walk? Well, it's just... It's dark out, and I really... I hardly know you. that's the point. You hardly know Doug, we hardly know you. Anyone hardly knows anyone. What louise means is just relax and trust us. For God's sake, we trust you. You're right. - I'm being silly again. - Yeah, you are. I mean, you peed in the toilet, we're all still here, ain't we? - You're right. - Come on. Doug's waiting. Where are you taking me? Doug will only meet in a remote spot. Shit. Hey, there, mrs... Rich? Can I come in? I wasn't really askin'. I was just bein' polite. Well, come on in, then. - You want a beer? - Sure. Thanks. Look at you, livin' in this fancy house, but you can't give up your travelin' tricks. I don't know what you're talkin' about, Dale. Come on. What did you slip in there? Go on and have a little sip. You don't want to get on my bad side. - What do you want from us? - They kicked me out, our family. Took all my money. All they left me was daddy's pickup truck. Aw. You look like you're doin' fine to me. Fine is far from it, sweetheart. Well, what do you want from us, Dale? You know what I want from you, d. But aside from that, I'll take a piece of your pie. I mean, seriously, what is your angle? - There's no angle, Dale. - Bullshit. What is the con? I mean, I got part of it figured out. Fake name, phony I.d. But this house? How did you score this friggin' place? And the lawyer gig? How is Wayne spinnin' that? Well, why don't you ask him? That is what I'm plannin' to do, mrs. Rich. He's... Busy. He ain't gonna be back for a while. I got all night. Do you want me to use a coaster? Doug, it's me! It's Pete! Doug, where are you? Doug! It's me! It's Pete Mintzy! Where are you?! Who sent you, Pete? W- what are you talking about? So how you been, mrs. Rich? - What, you're not talkin' to me now? - Just tryin' to live my life here, Dale And I am tryin' to be neighborly. Well, neighbors come and neighbors go. So why don't you go 'cause I told you Wayne is not gonna be back here for a while. And I told you, I am willin' to wait. I know what you are. I know why you're here. I- I'm Pete. Pete Mintzy. You tell me who sent you, or I will put a bullet in your skull. Gene, I-I swear to you. I have no idea what you're talkin' about. Just tell me! Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. Look! Look, it's from Doug! He's saying I'm innocent! Look at that! Doug, it's me! It's Pete! Where are you?! Where are you?! He's gone. Gone? He's afraid. What are you doin'? Gonna call the cops to say I got intruders in my house. Your jailbird ass is gonna call the cops on me? You bet. I'm mrs. Douglas Rich. I'm married to mr. Douglas Rich. I ain't afraid of local cops. Are you? All right. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I don't mean you any harm. I think what y'all got goin' here is beautiful. This Edenfalls, it's a heaven on earth. You're wrong, Dale. It ain't heaven on earth. Will you go, please? Well, not without a hug, cousin. You tell that husband of yours I'll be back around. You okay? No broken bones? What did you mean, who sent me? What the hell is going on here? I understand you're upset. I will explain. I trust you now. Your friend Doug, he witnessed a murder, a brutal execution that no one should have to see. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but he wanted to do the right thing, so he went to the police. But the trouble was, it was an inside job. Some bad cops wanted him gone, so Doug and Cherien, they went on the run. This is where I come in. Through contacts, they hired me to make the world believe that I was Doug Rich to lure these bastards in, so I could give them what they deserve. It's what I do. I'm what they call a mechanic, Pete. I'm a trained killer. It's my job. I have to travel ready for anything. Sometimes the weapon'll get pretty basic. It's a job. Now, I know the truth is difficult to swallow. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. Doug's life is in danger. He has to remain hidden from everyone, even from you. You understand? Do you understand? Now, I'm gonna put you in this car and drive you back to your car, and then you go north, and you forget this ever happened. And you wait for Doug to contact you in his own sweet time. Now, can you do that, Pete? Good man. What is that? Shit. - Nothing. Let's go. - Are you bleeding? No. It's... Don't... It doesn't matter. It's a water gun. It's a goddamn water gun, you goddamn liar! You lunatic! What have you done? Wow, look what the cat dragged in. It almost worked. Almost does not count, Wayne. Where... Lisa? Hi, sweetheart.

We live in the house next door to you. You know that. - I mean, this is where you come from. - No, Nina, we come from tampa. I just... I have no idea who's been in here. It's just, uh...

I hurt her real bad, and... Dad! Pete is not dead. He is asleep. We do not have all day. She said I was the saddest person she ever met. Said I had no heart. She didn't mean that. She was upset. We're headin' out. She'll come back. I don't know. Hey, man, can you come over? I need you. I mean, I'm sittin' here, tellin' you I need you.

Oh, whatever. So this, uh, Doug and Cherien, the Riches? You've known them for years? They're real? Or they were. And these people, whoever they are... They took over their lives. Information like that, you could really hold over somebody's head. You could use that to get some serious green. You mean blackmail them? Are you out of your mind? I don't want money. I want my friends. I got to go to the police and have those two arrested. I have to find out what they've done with my friends. Oh, my God! What am I doing here? What's wrong with me?
