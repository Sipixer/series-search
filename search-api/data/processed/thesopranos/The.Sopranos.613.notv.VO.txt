The ar-10, that's my birthday present to you. Thanks, Bobby. Don't say shit to Carmela. Me and Tony almost got a summer place-- Down the Shore, remember, Tony ? Any more stuffed mushrooms ? My pop bought this place 'cause it was close to canada. He had ties in montreal. You know, Ton'. His father, my grandpop, come into the country Originally through montreal, illegally. No kidding ? He wasn't Ellis island, your grandfather ? Nah, got mixed up in some shenanigans on the other side, Anti-Government or something. Had a police record. They oughta build a wall now, though. - I'm telling you. - Amen. Mommy ! When are the kids back ? Sophia the 7th and robert the end of the month. That's nice.

Oh, look, the fish are jumping. I'm different how ? How am I different ? Story you heard. - The pool. - Oh my God, please. - What ? - You don't wanna know. Pradeep, our pharmacist, Was at a pool party. All the kids were playing in the water. The adults were all around and having drinks, barbecuing. Somehow even with all these people around, This three-Year-Old child managed to fall into the pool. Nobody even noticed till finally they found him floating face down In the water. Brain dead. Poor kid's in one of those padded wheelchairs now. Oh. I can't get that story out of my mind. I don't know why. Happy birthday.

Don't let us forget to wash the sheets, okay ? Yeah, ha ha ! Anthony reboam Soprano. What's up ? Tony seem to hit the hooch a little at lunch today ? I think he's feeling his age. What do you think it's like for me ? When we were kids, He'd do whatever I said. He ate one of tippy's milk-Bones because I told him it was a cookie. My therapist sandy, She said my ma was a splitter. She'd pit us three against each other-- To toughen us up, I guess. I couldn't help hearing you with AJ. God, you gotta walk on eggshells with these kids today, huh ? We're almost through that phase, thank God. You're good with them. Really ? I wish he'd go back to college. He sleeps most nights at blanca's. Speaking of kids and ma, Sandy said something interesting-- That when we were babies, Everything was fine, But ma couldn't stand that as her babies got older, They separated from her. When they started to talk and express ideas, That's when the trouble started. It wasn't that she didn't love us. Mmm-Mmm ! You've been a solid performer for some time now.</i></i> Plus, you're my brother-In-Law. You get older, you think about things. You're a young man. We both are. - World's still in front of us. - Boss. My estimate historically, 80% of the time it ends up in the can like Johnny Sack Or on the embalming table at cozarelli's. Don't even say it. No risk, no reward. I mean, yeah, our line of work, it's always out there. You probably don't even hear it when it happens, right ? Ask your friend in there on the wall. Listen to us. Morbid fucks. Come to think of it, you never popped your cherry in that regard, right ? No. Yet your old man was the fucking Terminator. I come close. I done other shit, but no. A salut'. It's a big fat pain in the balls. Especially now with DNA evidence. My pop never wanted it for me. He said there were times with all the worry That he wished he could have stayed in the shop full-Time, Just cut hair. To be honest, I'd rather he fucking shot me than cut my hair. There's somebody I've been bringing along to insulate myself From the stuff that could bring down a boss, And take care of Carmela too, in case... God forbid. Now maybe Between me and this person... there's diverging agendas. - Sorry to hear it. - It happens. Thing is, the newark facilities manager, He's gonna fix it so we do all the window replacements In the projects. I was thinking maybe you should work that. I'm honored just to be considered. Then we'll see what happens after that, long-Term. - Time for presents. - And grappa. I told you people I didn't want any presents, just... just a few kind words. That was my father's line every year. I get the joke, believe me. "Soprano home movies." I had all the super 8s from when we were kids transferred. Oh, cool. It's really very thoughtful.

It goes in the bank. - We play the free parking rule. - What free parking rule ? Money from community chest and chance goes into the middle. Whoever lands on free parking ge the money. You show me that in the rules. Technically it isn't in the rules, but a lot of people play it that way. It adds a whole new level of excitement to the game. I don't agree with that. When we were growing up in our house, this is how we played. You know, the parker brothers took time to think this all out. I think we should respect that. Fuck the parker brothers. Just play the game. Out of grappa. How about some rémy ? - 9, 10, 11... - Yay ! - Fuck. - Marvin gardens With two houses-- 360 simoleons. Don't throw the money at me. Hand it to me. I saw that. - Saw what ? - You just kyped $500 from the bank. God damn it, Tony ! I beg your pardon, my sweet little potato. You asshole. - Free parking, baby. - This is bullshit.

That looked like a bribe to me. You know what, uncle Tony ? Butt the fuck out. In front of the baby. They're in the kitchen. Night-Night. I could tape you. Send it to "parents magazine." What's that supposed to mean ? When we were kids, remember ? You tape-Recorded me and barb fighting. You blackmailed us for over a fucking month. - I did no such thing. - Oh ! Yeah, you did. - You fed him a milk-Bone. - You what ? You want to swap family stories, Ton' ? How about the time that mom and dad Were coming back from the copa ? That's enough, Janice. And ma's hair... that never even happened. And anyway, it's not for public consumption. - Oh, my God, what ? - They're driving back from Manhattan With uncle jun and his goomar. Oh, what was her name, Tony ? - Your ass. - That's how we heard the story... Through her. Rose marie. Anyway, My father's driving, And she's ragging on his ass. You know how she'd get.
