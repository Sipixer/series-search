They've been patted down too. Anybody want a water? - no. - no. Butch: we started it? We got a dead goomar</i> In queens and her old ukrainian father. Tony: and I'm not even gonna blame Phil. John sacramoni, my friend, I'm sorry to say, was an insecure guy. He created a constant tension Within his own family which spilled over. Go ahead, Carmine. George was good enough To broker this meeting for us. You're just gonna sit there? It didn't have to be this way. We agree. It's gone too far. Phil, I don't know-- he's changed. You got my word: we'll back off. My price is you help us get a location on Phil. Uh, I can't go there. But you do what you gotta do. One more thing: you hit my brother-in-law. - so? - this is my sister We're talking about. She's gotta see something out of this. We'll come up with a number. Look at all this mail. ( '60s song playing ) Anybody need some barber's scissors? - ton'? - put some next to my coat. ( mews ) He was at the safe house. We brought him over. Get him the fuck out. These are snakes with fur.

Speaking of jokers, where's that other son of yours today? I didn't think he was invited. I just thought with all the wedding talk, you know... No no, really, that pal of his, the other Jason-- I heard he ran into some trouble, - Carlo's Jason. - he's a mess. All right. Well, he's got no shortage of lawyers here. ( all laugh ) Ton', patsy needs a refill. - no, ton', I'll-- - sit down. Of course, this one here would only take the case for free. That's why we want her over at Grubman, Grubman & Curcio. Actually, Mead' and I have had some conversations</i> And we may still snag her over at the firm - when she's done with law school. - no kidding? We went out to dinner with steven grubman and the subject came up. Steven was very impressed with her work at the poverty law center.</i> He even got into starting salaries. He was talking $170. Jesus. Sweetheart, that's fantastic, huh? He had had too much gevrey. Don't devalue yourself. We've got a really interesting case right now.</i> We're defending James Trefoglio, The county commissioner, on those corruption charges. Is that your case, honey? Bid rigging. It's got bagmen, whores. It's fascinating. - ( rock music playing ) - ( growling )</i> ( chuckles ) yeah, he does that, Sometimes most of the day-- just stares at chrissy's picture.</i> The fuck? You know, they're funny that way. I had an aunt, her cat would only sit At the exact corners of the table, staring at her, Or at the intersection of two walls, staring in. This fucking animal is history, today! - pick him up. - you pick him up. ( door opens ) T, you see this shit? Does it all the time, he says.</i> - oh yeah? - look at him staring at that dead kid.

I want you to skipper that thing. - really? - fucking thing is one big ATM machine. All our construction with New York folds right into your kick. Yeah. Jesus christ, I thought you'd be pleased. I didn't hand you the diagnosis of the clap. With due respect, I'd like to just mull it a little. I'm no spring chicken no more. I don't want to have me dying on you, leaving you worse off than before. Oh, you with the dead thing. You got the arms and upper body of a 20-year-old. I gotta work at that. And I had the prostate.

I gotta deal with rhiannon first. Rhiannon? What about your mother? - her too. - are you nuts? You wanna get sent to Iraq? Afghanistan. The army's probably good for my career.

( stammers ) I'm not even gonna tell your mother about this. And don't you do nothing Until we've had another chance to talk. - you hear me? - yes.</i> He's gonna join the fucking army. I gotta be frank, You people got him out of his room-- great-- So he can be cannon fodder? I wasn't aware of this latest plan. ( door opens ) Sorry. I should have gone before we left the house. Still on the army thing. On the other hand, I'm thinking maybe he could benefit From the training, the discipline. Maybe the army'd be great for him If there wasn't a war going on. Oh, I didn't tell you, he spent $200 On a set of cds that teach arabic. Jesus Christ, come on. "shish kebab"-- what else do you need to know? He used to just veg in front of that tv.

You're gonna get married and my chances are flying by me. - yeah. - so, your brother, Our little soldier boy-- What do you think is wrong with that googootz? The world is a sad, fucked-up place. If there's so much suffering in the world, - why did you go off the pediatrician bit? - we talked about that. You said you wanted to be a lawyer for black people. Oh, that's all I said? Really? What I said was: the state can crush the individual. - New Jersey? - the government. Specifically, the federal government. And what about little babies In the face of meningitis? You know what really turned me? Seeing the way italians are treated. It's like mom says. And if we can have our rights trampled like that, Imagine what it's like for recent arrivals. - well... - if I hadn't seen you Dragged away all those times by the fbi Then I'd probably be a boring suburban doctor.

As your parents we don't feel Joining the army is in your best interest. This country is in a crisis. How can one soldier stop it? When my enlistment's up, I could join the CIA or something. And with a military background I'll have a leg up. And as an arabic speaker, I'll be really useful. I don't understand. You're gonna ask the donald For some time off from your pilot job to go on CIA missions? - everything's a joke to you. - I'm not having a good time. Did you or did you not want me to go to military school? But I started to cry. At least you'd have come out an officer. Even then I was opposed to it. I hate this idea. I'm applying for officer's candidate school. I want to be a liaison officer With the local population anyway. Officer's candidate school? You have terrible grades. You flunked out of college. Here we go. That's all this is about, right? No, Anthony, that's not what this is all about. You don't want to go to college-- don't go to college, - but don't get your legs blown off. - always with the drama. So what does your girlfriend say, the fashion model? She doesn't think I should go either. Well? Not that long ago you talked about owning a club. Right. You had a problem with that too.

You may not realize it but you are making contacts. It's an entry-level job. So buck up. Right, focus on the good times. Don't be sarcastic.
