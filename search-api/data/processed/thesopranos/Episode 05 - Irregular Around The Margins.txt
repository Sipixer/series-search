What are you doing here? Well, I got an office here. - You come down with Finn? - And some people. Promise me no drinkin' and drivin'. Who's your designated driver? I'm not the one with all the dents in their car. All right, have fun, huh? Need some money? Have a good time, sweetheart. Be careful! - You see Meadow? - Yeah, I wish I knew she was here. I wonder what the fuck she's thinkin'. I'm sorry, Ton'. Some kid had a seizure upstairs, - it's been a horrible night. - Hey, Ton', Vito and Gene just called, they're five minutes away. We're leaving. Here. All right, call 'em and tell 'em to meet us at Bud's Butter Bun on Broadway and 18th. All right. Did I just see your father? He's got an office here. Saturday night? That's dedication. The guy sure can put in the hours. Let's go someplace else. Tony's spendin' so much time at the club. Do you think that might have something to do with you? Oh, if you think I'm gonna blow this guy for your sick purposes you are sadly mistaken. So go on about this phone call the other night. It was just some guy with a Southern accent. Christopher grabbed the phone, he yelled at him for callin' the house, - said he'd see him down there. - Down where? Did you check the log on his cell? Not since I almost got caught doin' that, and I am not doin' it again. Wait till he goes into the shower. See if there's a 4-0-4 or 3-3-6, and memorize any other numbers you don't recognize. - What's the matter? - I got to go to the bathroom. - I know, you said. - No, I-I got to go. - Number two. - I'll take you to your car. No, I got to go now. Oh my God. You okay? We're almost there. Try to relax. Don't you got a general anesthetic or somethin'? This lidocaine doesn't do much. We are... done. Jan, want to do your thing? Just keep a little pressure. All right. I'm gonna get this down to the lab, see what's what. Okay. There we go. - You okay? - You think he got it all? We hope so. Meantime, there's a canteen on Level L. I'll let you know when the results come back. Does having a bowel movement relieve the pain? Yeah. Would you describe the diarrhea - as loose or liquid? - Liquid. But this is gettin' so I'm afraid to be away from the toilet. I'm so scared I'm gonna have an accident. - Is this tender? - No. Sit up. - How's your personal life? - What do you mean? Well, sometimes GI disturbances are stress-related. Is there anything unusual that might be giving you the jimjams? I just want somethin' for my stomach so I can quit goin' to the bathroom. That's what's givin' me stress. Why don't you get dressed? We'll talk in my office. I hear you're spending time with today's youth. You lost me. Meadow said she saw you at Adriana's club. I got to explain my business to you now? After so many years? - No, it's your life, Tony. - Got that right. What did you do to your head? Did you fall again? Banged it on the medicine chest. Don't worry 'bout it. It's nothin'. There's your allowance. Now that actually looks like fruit. Yeah, it's so hard. What do you do it for? Irritable bowel syndrome? He'll know more when the tests come back. I still got to bring him a stool sample. Jesus, please. You were the one who yelled at me to go to the doctor. I got to know every detail? I could be really sick, Christopher. Yeah, my Aunt Josephine had colon cancer. Her whole asshole rotted out. I may have to go into therapy. Plus, they're gonna put me on Prozac. For diarrhea? To help me cope and handle stress, which is a lot of what causes it. What do you got to be stressed about? That bar? War, Christopher? The Middle East? You don't listen to the President? We're gonna mop the floor with the whole fuckin' world. The whole world's gonna be under our control, so what are you worked up about? Oh, give me the Orioles over the Tigers for two, and the Jays over the Rangers, three G's. I'm just gettin' my day planner. No, I'm done. My stupid car. 5,000 miles and the alternator's goin'. What about you? Mimi said you went to the doctor. I've been havin' trouble with my stomach, that's why I'm drinkin' White Russians. What, you got ulcers already? - It's called IBS. - What's that? Irritable bowel syndrome. My mother had that all her life. See this? - Yeah, I noticed that. What happened? - It's cancer. - What? - Yeah, squamous. Oh my God, that's terrible. Well, they think they got it all. Knock wood. Just cancer. The things that run through your head, you know? - Sure. - I got a top guy, though... Katz. Hesh recommended him, naturally. So this... disease you got. What causes it? I did a Google on it and like the doctor, too. They all say a lot of it's psychological. So on top of everything, now I'm a head case. No, come on, stop blamin' yourself. Christopher don't want to know, but not that I blame him. I got to take off. AJ should be comin' home from his volleyball thing. Listen, don't say anything to anybody, okay? People hear cancer, they start to bury you already. And you don't tell anybody what I told you. All right, take care of yourself. Say hi to Anthony. - Yeah. - You're such a good father. I wish my dad had been like that. Good night, dear. It's a straight shot on l-95 to Raleigh. You give this shit to the fence, I'll meet you in Winston-Salem, we'll load up the cigs and come home. We're pickin' up so many cigarettes, why don't we instead of two vans rent a deuce and a half? You know, share the drivin'. Because the cops... The van's under the radar. - Eric Estrada over here. - You forgot your folic acid. What is all this stuff? A beauty parlor chair? If they even heard of electrolysis down there. - Where are you goin'? - Jesus Christ, go back to bed. What the fuck's your problem? My fuckin' tooth is killin' me. Well, you should go back to the dentist. Why do you have to go anyway? Can't they just drop this stuff off? Tony wants me to talk to the guy down there. The jerk you were yellin' at on the phone? Is that the cigarette thing you were talkin' about? Six different kinds of dope you get to take for a stomach-ache, I got an impaction, I can't take shit besides oil of clove, 'cause I'm sober. I know, it's hard. I'm sorry. Have a nice trip. - I love you, call me. - She's got diarrhea. Whoops. You want? Aw, twist my arm. I'm expectin' some guys from New York, so... No problem. I got plenty to do out there. - Ah. Who's this on? - Please. It's called "The Lost Boys." Sil's been raggin' on me all week for me to play 'em here. Their manager or somebody owes him money. So, I thought this was your day off. Chrissy's away. I don't like stayin' home alone. Although, at least I can pour a glass of wine without him givin' me "the expression." Yeah. Yeah, I know that look. The constipated owl look. You know, when I first met you I was scared of you. Really? Yeah, but I'm scared of everybody. It's always my first reaction. Well, you're not scared of me now, are you? No. You want to shoot? Huh? Make it interesting, say a buck a game. Mmm? No, it's the round thing in the middle there. How you feelin'? Everything all right in here now? - Your stomach all right? - I know what you're doin'. Don't distract me. Oh. - Ho! - Hmm. I've been hustled. - Did I get your toe? - No. No, no, no. I'm so sorry. Come on, get up. Come on. Aw, shit. All right. Wait. Yeah, go on. - Tony here? - Yeah, come on in. Hey. Let me know if you guys need anything. What, are you gonna tell me about the traffic again? Here, our friend sent this for you. Thank you for taking the appointment. And I know I'm on probation, and I deeply regret... what I did. My nephew's fiancee. I know what you're thinking. So? Well, nothing happened, but it could've very easily. I mean, she really got to me, this young lady. She, uh... What? This is a very big step. Yeah, tell me about it. I mean, that you've come here to talk about this impulse instead of just acting on it without thinking. No, I always think. - Really? - Yeah. Having sex with your mistress' cousin, like the mistress wasn't enough to piss off your wife. Tell me about the niece. She's drop-dead gorgeous. Someone like her I could... I could do it right this time, I could start a whole new family. I'm young enough. Fuck 'em all. And this is something you're contemplating? What? It would be a disaster of major proportions. Carmela... I'd get hosed financially. There would be no reasoning with her after that. And my nephew, it would kill him... after years of grooming him to be my number two. And it would be very bad for the girl. She doesn't deserve that. I mean, I'm not stupid. I know part of it's this father-figure thing... you know, on account of hers ran off. It would be like committing an act of symbolic incest. Whatever. Look, what am I gonna do? I got lucky the first time, 'cause I was able to control myself, - but you only get one of those. - Rationalizing. "I can't control myself." You can. I don't know. It's different for women. It's all about up here with them. She could make a play for you. You might want to think about how you're going to establish limits and boundaries. For example, you could tell her she means a great deal to you, but you think of her as a daughter. Even if I want to fuck her brains out. This is a milestone for you. You're at a very important crossroads. For once you want to avoid doing something you know is wrong and would be destructive both to yourself and to the people you care about. That's growth. That's progress. Just tell me what I'm supposed to do. You have to be honest with yourself. I know this is a powerful urge, but if you can't keep it in your pants, you have to stay away from her. You know... not long ago, you stood in my outer office. I recall you used the words "drop-dead gorgeous" about me and how you had to have me. I said I wouldn't date you, and look, you survived. What a horrible fucking job you have. How do you do it? But what happens now is your choice. Act and create a bed of misery, or you can look at this as a chance to do something good. You say she respects you. Be worthy of respect. See if you can remain a friend to this woman, a help to her. You know, Tony had ducks one time... in his pool. You need to find out where Chris went. I'm getting this vibe from him. Who? Tony? He's really nice. He listens. He's kind of attractive... definitely an alpha male... but what if Christopher found out? What? I'm not gonna fuck him. Then, what are you talking about? I love Christopher, and sooner or later we're gonna get out from under all this shit and leave this fucking state. Jesus Christ. She's a good-looking woman, and she wants to fuck Barney Rubble? "Well, we really don't know him. He listens." Excuse me, is this seat taken? - Tony, hi. - Hey. How you doing? Well, why I'm here, Patsy's bringing somebody by, - I'm gonna need to use the office. - No problem. I made a resolution. I got to start spending a lot more time on the floor. Crack the whip. I'm beat, tell you the truth. I think I'm gonna grab 40 winks till Patsy gets here. Wait, you don't have Chrissy's cell, do you? He called but he didn't leave a new number. He'll probably try you again. He's due back tomorrow. Oh, excuse me. - I'll come back. - No, I'm all right. This mole back there looked irregular around the margins. Every time I see anything now, I think I got melanoma. I can imagine. Hi, it's Adriana at The Crazy Horse. Yeah, I need a car, please. Just tell him to wait outside. What, your car still? Yeah, they're replacing the alternator. You want a belt? What I could really use is some... I wouldn't say no. Get me motivated to clean the house before Christopher gets back, except I'm all out. It's 2:00, Cross-Eyed Billy probably left the Bing already. I know a guy, Andre, he's always up. Well, cancel the car, I'll give you a ride. You know who thinks you're cute... is Marlene. She's got to be over 30, isn't she? She's 31. You know who you ought to introduce me to is that friend a yours. Who? The one you brought over to the house that time. Tall, kind of blondish, brownish hair... - Danielle from Whippany. - She's dead. What? Yeah, she drowned on a picnic. Oh. You know, I thought I picked up on something between her and me. I'm not trying to be conceited. Tony! I've reviewed your chart and ruled out internal injuries, so you're free to go. I'll have the nurse process your discharge orders. Whoa, whoa. This was a very bad accident. Are you sure you did all the tests? I can afford it. I did the appropriate tests. I have a medical degree from Johns Hopkins. My grandmother was the first black woman licensed to practice medicine in Delaware. All right, take it easy. The young lady that I was with, they said she was okay, but could I see her? Ade. - Hi. - Hi. They say you're gonna be fine, they just want to keep you here for observation. You know, be on the safe side. I don't even remember what happened. There was a raccoon in the road, I swerved. - How's your car? - Escalade? It's totaled. Probably saved our life. Are you okay? Yeah, they're gonna let me go. I want to go too. Chrissy's coming home today. We should probably talk about that. Oh. Yeah. Right. Dude, how you doing? I hit the fucking mother-lode. 20 Gs of product a week. Little Paulie's behind me - with the other half. - Fuck me. Now, 20% of this load, they can stamp the packs for the vending machines. The rest, the cartons can go straight to the bodegas, let them worry about the stamps. I'm beat. I'm gonna hit the fucking rack, have Ade cook me up a nice carbonara. What's the matter? Don't know how to tell you, but Adriana's in the hospital. - She was in an accident. - What? When? Last night around 2:00. Jesus Christ, what happened? Is she all right? She got banged up, but she's gonna be okay. The drinking and driving... I told her! - Where is she? - Mount Mercy in Dover. - Dover? - Apparently they swerved - to avoid a deer in the road. - They? - Her and Tony. - Tony? Soprano? - Uh-huh. - Is he all right? Not a scratch. The fucking luck on this guy. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Dover. Right, she's got an aunt she's close to out there who's been sick. She's friends with Tony's aunt. All right, somebody take me to get my car. I better get over there. Fabio, put it up! Thought I'd die in there without a cigarette. What, so you're just not gonna talk? I almost got killed, Christopher. I'm just curious. What the fuck were you doing in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere in a car with my uncle? He was driving me home. - Fucking Dover? - We were talking. W-we were going to get something to eat. I get off of work, I don't want to go right home. You weren't even there. No, I was in a fucking Ride-A-Rent busting my ass with a bunch of rednecks making a living, to buy you alcohol and coke and all the other shit you shovel into your mouth! 2:00 in the fucking morning?! Don't fucking lie to me! I can't stand it! Nothing was going on, Christopher! - I should've made you walk home! - I swear to God. You know how this looks? Don't talk to me! Shut your mouth! You wanted to see me? - Is Adriana okay? - She's fine. People who don't clean up after their pets... Pop this in that basket for me, will you? It's blind luck, that accident. Cop told me he thought he was coming up on a fatality when he saw the car. I would be thinking the same thing if I were you, but it's not true. I don't know what you're talking about. Her car was in the shop, I was driving her home from work, that's all. We were looking to get a burger. In Dover. What difference does it make? You don't seem to give a shit she almost died. She could've been paralyzed or scarred up, and you got a puss on? What were you doing out there alone in a car with my fiancee? We were talking about you, you selfish prick, and how you're the best thing that ever happened to her. Oh, you don't think this fucking devastates me? Well, frankly, you scored so far over your head when you got her, what do you expect? What the fuck are you talking about? She's a knockout, a 10, and look at you. You're average at best, so you better reconcile yourself with that, or you're gonna be fucking paranoid your whole life. Oh, so this is my fucking fault now? Nothing happened, and I'm not gonna say it again! And you should've married that girl two years ago. Everybody knows you've been the biggest fucking cooze hound around the past four or five years. Your mid-life crisis. You'd fuck a catcher's mitt. On everything I hold sacred, on my children, there's nothing going on between me and Adriana. Tony walked away without a scratch, but Adriana suffered a severe blow to the head. Adriana got caught giving the big guy a blowjob. And when the paramedics found them, she had his cock still in her mouth. Now, statistics show that most single-car fatalities are the result of guys popping their load behind the wheel. Apparently, he came all over the sun visor. Sanseverino. Guess who went down on Tony Soprano. That's the truth. It's fact. If it was my old lady, the next thing she would suck - is a tailpipe. - That pretty little trim can suck this pipe anytime she wants. Like you would ever have a shot. Hey, let me tell you something. When Christopher was in rehab, she was calling me all the time. - I was this close. - Then you got a problem, 'cause your braciole isn't even that long. What's so funny? Nothing. Didn't sound like nothing, I want to hear the big joke. Take it easy, we're just shooting the shit. We were just talking about my braciole. - Oh yeah, what about it? - So, deal you in, huh? I asked him a fucking question. What are you breaking my balls for? I want a fucking answer. What's so fucking hilarious, - you fucking parade float? - Oh! I'm a fucking captain now. You don't talk to me like that! - Oh, come on, guys. - Don't put your hands on me! - Chrissy, for Christ's sake! - Fuck all of youse! - Oh! Whoa, whoa! - Motherfucker! - Hold it. - Easy. Vinar, Jimmy, please join me. So talk to me, guys, how do we look in these? Hey, hon. I already ate. - There's a casserole in... - You fucking lying bitch! Ow! Stop it! What are you doing?! You were sucking his cock! Georgie told me everything! The surgeon on the operating table said you were moaning Tony's name! - What are you talking about?! - You fucking lied to me! What were you doing in Dover then? See? You can't tell me, 'cause I know what you were doing! Your other dope dealer's there. I remembered, go ahead, deny it! Okay! I was going out to see Andre, but I wasn't sucking anybody's cock! How could you say that? Oh, so you two were just gonna go toot up a bunch of lines, go fucking birdwatching? Oh, you son of a bitch. I was gonna stay up all night and clean this fucking shithole! Everybody knows about it! Everybody's talking about it! - No, please! - You want me to use you, bitch! - You're fucking killing me! - No, I don't, I love you! Stop it. - You motherfucker! - Fucking whore. Ow, my neck! Get the fuck out of here! I never want to see you again! I thought you had an algebra test. - Oh, chill out. - What did you say? Well, look, I studied for 45 minutes straight, don't I get a break? Hi. What's up? Oh, AJ, how's it going? Hey, Uncle Tony. Did I come at a bad time? I need to talk to you. AJ, go upstairs, study. - Well, what about the pizza? - Now! Study. All right, what's up? I went to the Belleville Tavern after work, and Larry down there said our little cousin was in there all fucked up. Somebody told him what was going on in the car. There was nothing going on in the car. No, of course not, but he thinks there was, so he started drinking again, he beat up Adriana and he threw her out of the fucking house. Where's his fucking self-control, this guy? Little Paulie's out there looking for him to rein him in, but he was saying some crazy things about you. Oh, this goddamn kid. Christopher's not right in the head, Ton'. Who the fuck knows what he's capable of? Well, he knows where to find me. You see him you tell him that. I got to use your john. Get you a day early, huh? I'll go to the store in the morning. Look, relax. Go whenever you want. What the hell is wrong with him? What do you want, Tony? He couldn't bring this in himself? I can't even come in and say hello? What you want is to know if I heard the disgusting shit they're saying. At least have the guts to come out and ask me. - It isn't true. - You know what? Fuck you! Fuck me? Fuck you! - You got to put your son in hiding because of your fucking philandering? Afraid he'll get caught in the crossfire? Your own son? Christopher's upset, that's all. He could come over. He could say some things - that a kid shouldn't hear. - Just please leave. I don't even want to look at you. Motherfucker! Motherfucking gun! Give me two. This kid ain't gonna show up, T. He's probably in some gutter. Yeah, hopefully he's wore himself down. Where are you, you fuck! He's got a gun! I know you're up there, motherfucker! You know what to do down there! You're fucking lucky! You're fucking lucky I ran out of loads! Shut up, you little cock, - or I'll split your fucking wishbone. - It's all over. Everybody, enjoy the evening. Unhappy customer. Let me the fuck go! I'll kill all of youse! I'll fucking kill all of youse! You draw down on the boss of a fucking family? - Huh?! - You lied to me! You were scoring coke with her! She admitted it! So what?! I can't relieve stress every once in a while?! I don't got enough fucking problems? You sent me to North Carolina so you could fuck my girlfriend. What kind of fucking animal you think I am, huh? The thought never even entered my head! You're a man! You're alone in a car with her... You fucking pushed me to this. You pushed me to this! Way I see it, he must've known the gun was empty. Look what he pumped into your car. What are you trying to say, Paulie?! What the fuck you trying to say, huh?! Either you tell me right now that you can take it into your heart that I did not do this shit... or this is as far as we go. - Motherfucker. - Tony, come on! - Listen to somebody else for a change. - Fuck him. Tony, try it my way. Listen to me. Mister... Sorriano, - what seems to be the matter? - Soprano. I'm fine. It's my friend here who needs to talk to you. You know where ER admitting is? Look, you got someplace maybe we could talk? It's 3:00 A.M., and I just finished a 17-hour rotation. Any gunshot wounds or broken kneecaps? Two minutes. You're an excellent doctor, that's why I brought him here. Come on. This gentleman here is the fiance of the young lady that I was with. Now, he's got it into his head that there was oral sex going on at the time of the wreck. - Listen, l... - Hey, hey, hey! Just a second. Naturally, he's very upset, so I need you to tell him there wasn't. He's obviously feeling the pressure, he's just gonna fucking lie. I'm not in the custom of lying about anything, but whether somebody was getting something in the car, how could I possibly attest to that? Well, as the attending, you could explain - how medically it's not possible. - Excuse me? If she was wearing her seatbelt, then there would have been abrasions to the lateral anterior aspect of the clavicle, wouldn't there? Or the right mid-sternum? Are you a physician? No, I'm a pre-board certified massage therapist. So did she have any of those kind of things? Actually, yes, on the right clavicle and the sternum just above the xiphoid process which would indicate an upright position at the moment of impact. So what he's saying is that she was sitting up. All right. Thank you, doctor. Come on. For the kids, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, whatever... here. Thank you! What do you want from me? I guess I believe you. All right. You threw food at Vito. That's got to be resolved. He was fucking laughing, which was wrong. But at this point now, it don't make no difference. Even if it wasn't true, it's what people think. They know you were out there scoring coke with her. What do you care what people think? You know the truth. I got to live in the world. And now I look like Joe Jerkoff. No, no, no, no. You know what? I might as well have fucked her. Thanks. Hello? I rang the doorbell six times. - Nobody answered. - What are you doing here? I want to talk to you. If you came to pick him up, he's not going. Oh, so you believe all that shit they're saying, huh? Am I that horrible? Really? Where there's smoke, there's fire. I don't know what you did. What's gonna happen when your children hear about this? - Meadow already suspects you. - Suspects what? She saw you at the club. She said she thought you were coked out. What are you talking about? I don't do drugs. She knows about the accident. What do you think she's gonna think? And with Anthony at that age? Oh, come on, the kids! The kids... It's about you! Fine, so it's all about me! What, do I mean nothing to you?! That I got to live with this swirling around me? Forget about what they're saying, I'm asking you. You think I'd have sexual relations with her? Adriana, who's gonna be a member of this family?! Now I want you to answer me truthfully. Look, I know I haven't been a fucking saint, all right? And you got plenty of issues of your own on that subject. But you haven't exactly been a fucking saint yourself. No, no, no, no, no, come here. You think I would go near that girl like that? Thank you. Look, I'm asking you to pull with me to put a good face on this thing. For the sake of the kids and this family. I got to bail you out? It's never-ending, your bullshit. Use a fucking crosswalk! Jesus Christ. Don't get all excited. Most of it's from the accident. - You okay? - What do you fucking think? Kicked out of my house, I may have ulcerated colitis and you call me up. We'd like your permission to put a listening device in your business. This relationship with Tony could net us a lot of chatter. Don't forget, it's him we're after. There is no relationship! The faster we get Tony and put him away, the sooner you can get on with your life. We can get a court order to install a device anyway, - but this will make our lives simpler. - Fuck you. I do enough for you people. You're not bugging my club. Adriana... it's a syndrome, protecting abusers. If it would've been Christopher alone in a car with a woman, I would've killed him. Arthur's sending something over with his compliments. Thank you. Thank you. Enjoy. - Nice to see you, Ton'. - Oh, thank you. - Gravy's good tonight. - Mm-hmm. Nice to see you.
