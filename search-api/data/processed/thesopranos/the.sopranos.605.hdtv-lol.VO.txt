DEPENDS WHAT MUSCLES I'M TRYING TO HIT, YOU KNOW? OH. YEAH, I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE GYM. YOU WANT, I'LL MAKE YOU A PROGRAM. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I COULD BENCH OVER 300 LBS. WITH A MAJOR HEAD COLD ONE TIME, I DID IT. YOU COUGH WI WTS LI THAT ER YT , YOU CRUSH YOUR NECK. I GUESS I DON'T GOTTA TELL YOU. HO! YOU DON'T SIGNAL? HEY, FUCK YOU! WHOA WHOA WHOA. SORRY. MY MOM SAYS I SHOULD COUNT 10, BUT I NEVER REMEMBER. WELL, HERE I AM. - BACK. - YEP. SO LET ME ASK YOU RIGHT OFF, IS THERE ANY CHANCE OF A MERCY FUCK? JUST KIDDING. - HOW ARE YOU FEELING? - YOU WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL. A GUT SHOT IS EVERYTHING THEY EVER TOLD YOU IT WAS. AND EMOTIONALLY? I'M HAPPY TO BE ALIVE. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO YOUR UNCLE SINCE IT HAPPENED? NO. AND WON'T. FINALLY GET TO SLEEP IN MY OWN BED TONIGHT. HAD A HOSPITAL BED IN THE HOUSE - LAST MONTH AND A HALF OR SO. - IS SLEEPING DIFFICULT? - TYLENOL HELPS. - WHAT ABOUT DREAMS, NIGHT TERRORS, ANYTHING LIKE THAT? GLOOM IS YOUR BUSINESS, AND BUSINESS IS GOOD. YOU WERE SHOT, ANTHONY, BY A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY. I KNOW. AND UNLESS I KNOW ABSOLUTELY <i>NOTHING</i> ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING, I THINK YOU AND I'LL HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM "POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS"? I GET IT, OKAY? MY UNCLE TRIED TO KILL ME, FOR THE SECOND TIME. THREE STRIKES AND I'M OUT, RIGHT? WHO KNOWS? MAYBE I AM SUPPRESSING THINGS. BUT FOR RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE EACH DAY IS A GIFT. I TOLD MY SISTER. AND THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA STAY. FAIR ENOUGH. IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEN? LET'S PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF BEFORE THIS ALL HAPPENED. A.J. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THINGS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE WITH THAT KID. FLUNKED OUT OF COLLEGE. HE WAITED TILL I WAS IN A COMA. DIDN'T YOU LEAVE SETON HALL AFTER A SEMESTER AND A HALF? ALL RIGHT, FINE, BUT WHY CAN'T HE COPY SOME OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT ME? - DOES HE HAVE A JOB? - BLOCKBUSTER. FIRST STOP ON THE SHITBIRD EXPRESS. IN SOME WAYS, THIS HORRIBLE SHOOTING MAY PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES. MY MISTAKES-- I GOT CAUGHT UP IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. YOU THINK IT CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU, BUT IT DOES. BUT I WAS REFERRING TO THE BIGGER PICTURE: THE READY ACCESS TO GUNS, THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO SOLVE DISPUTES BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF YOUR WORK, YOUR UNCLE'S WORK. I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY UNCLE. FINE, BUT FOR NOW IS IT SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE ARE WORSE WAYS TO EARN MONEY THAN BY STOCKING SHELVES AT BLOCKBUSTER? YEAH, THERE ARE. - COME ON, YOU IN OR WHAT? - DON'T FUCK WITH MY CONCENTRATION. I'VE WARNED YOU BEFORE. WHAT IS IT? 800 MORE? FUCK IT. FOLD. Sil: <i>CARDS.</i> OH! THERE'S THE SKIP.

LESS PULLING ON THE OUTER DERMIS LAYERS. THE THING IS WITH ALL THE ATIVAN AND THE DILAUDID I WAS TAKING, INTESTINAL BLOCKAGE WAS A CONSTANT FUCKING PROBLEM. - SO IN THE LONG RUN-- - THERE'S YOUR COFFEE, TON'. - YEAH. - Dante: <i>TON',</i> WITH YOUR MEDICINE, - YOU WANT I SET MY WATCH SO YOU DON'T GOTTA WORRY? - NURSE BETTY OVER HERE.

EVIDENCE <i>CONSISTENT</i> WITH DEMENTIA. NONETHELESS, I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND HE BE SENT TO A PRISON PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. HE'LL ONLY BE WAREHOUSED IN A PUBLIC FACILITY. NOW, YOUR HONOR, WE ASK THAT MR. SOPRANO BE SENT - TO A PRIVATE LOCKED FACILITY. - WHY NOT A RESORT IN ANTIGUA? YOU WANT HIS MENTAL STATE IMPROVED SO YOU CAN PUT HIM ON TRIAL? JUST LET HIM GO TO A PLACE WHERE HE CAN GET BETTER. YOU GOT UNCLE ANGELO AT TABLE 19? WHAT? HE'S WITH CONNIE AND THEM. AND WHEN HE SEES AUNT LORRAINE AND THE HAITIAN BOYFRIEND SITTING NEXT TO THEM... - I THGHT YOU WERE ON TOP OF THIS. - THERE'S 400 PEOPLE, JOHN. I'VE HAD OTHER THINGS ON MY MIND.
