Dr. Nathan, please return to e. R. Bay five. Where'd you park? In the parking lot. No one followed me. Adriana, you wouldn't know it if they did. Oh, yeah, like tony soprano's hidin' in my backseat. You are so paranoid. Bring the car right here. I know. He's in disguise. That could be him. Hey, tony! Or maybe he's in the trash can. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Ow! Let go of me! It could be anybody anytime. I don't even know if it's tony who's after me. Christopher, you gave crystal meth to hisdaughter. Which i'm not sure he knows. Look at my wrist. It's all red. I'm sorry! I am sorry! But i got dragged out to the fuckin' meadowlands by my neck, mock execution! What? What? Nothin'. No. What? You don't want to know, okay? Trust me. No. What? I heard the nurse say you made number two in your pants. Is that what happened? Get the car! Please! Can we just go to brendan's, score some shit... and find out what the fuck is goin' on, please? The moon. The full moon! Brendan, let's go. Wake up, man. For the exact time. The fool leaves his door open. I gotta pee. Go for it. Yo, einstein. You should have seen me at the hospital. It took three nurses to hold me-- you will understand and comply with the following orders. All security personnel are to be equipped with silver bullets. Those silver bullets are to be blessed by a priest, not in english, but in latin. All passengers and personnel are to be restricted to their cabins... with the doors bolted and locked. End of orders! Sir! Yes, sir! Take him below. Take him below. Yeah. Yeah. Uh- huh. That's the message. Thanks. Way to go, anth! Here, in five, four, three, two. Yo. Yo, check it. You think this is funny? What? What's funny? Yeah, i didn't do nothin'. You beep me one more time, you're gonna be sorry. We don't know what you're talking about. "Your mother blows." That's a real original message. Yeah, maybe she does, right, anth? Yeah. Oh, yeah? Then why'd you scarf up all the doughnuts she sent us at camp? And you used to cry on her shoulder,"i'm so homesick, mrs. Piocosta!" Why don't you shut up? Have another doughnut, ya fat fart knocker. Oh, go on! Kill'im! Yeah! Oh, yes! Dick wad! Ass! Hey! Break it up. Break it up! I want a five- minute cooldown period right now. See ya next week, doc. Oh, mr. Dante, you forgot something. Oh, thank you, baby. - Don't forget to keep flossing. - You saved my life. All right. All right. See you next week, all right? Can i help you, sir? Sir? Sir? Oh, my god. I'm having second thoughts. About? This whole thing, the whole arrangement. Security. I come here. I tell you things. I don't know how safe it is. I understand your concerns. But i told you what the ground rules are. As long as i don't hear anything incriminating-- you don't fuckin' get it. Just my bein' here incriminates me. Somebody sees me, they tell somebody else. All of a sudden, i'm a celebrity! I thought we made some progress of your narcissism. Who are you? Why is that so important for you to know? My mother told me never to answer a question with a question. So, your mother did teach you something. If i asked you about your life, who you talked to, who you trust-- i'd have to take the fifth. That's cute. Oh! I-- i-- i'm sorry. I wasn't aware of what i was...saying. I'm...sorry. Hey, what are you doing here? Chris sent me to pick you up. Chris? Why? Did something happen? Must be my dad, right? Why else would chris send you? Did brendan get my poem? It's probably nothing. Another search warrant. He calls them the federal bureau of annoying bullshit. You told your old man, didn't you? You scared me. What happened? This is me and adriana movin' to florida'cause some puke couldn't keep your mouth shut. What are you talking about? Seriously. Did brendan say anything about me? Get us outta here! Get us out! What did you tell your old man? About the meth? You insane? He'd have me beaten up! Don't you get it? This is serious! Let go of me! Listen-- stop this shit! He's worried about you. He's been asking where you've been, you asshole! I'm sorry if i hurt ya. I hate my life, being a soprano. Hey. Don't ever say you hate life. That's blasphemy. Fuck you. Okay, let's go. Remember like when you were little. I'll buy you one of those happy meals, all right? Where the fuck are you? This is a new shirt. Your grandmother bought you this shirt. I find it in the trash? It's a westport. It's not even cool anymore. What did you just say? I got in a fight. I hope it was worth it. I hope you did as much damage to his wardrobe. Who with? I didn't get caught. No demerits. Anthony, who? Jeremy. Jeremy piocosta? You spent all that time together at camp. I thought you were friends. Well, if that's all the information i'm getting, i'm calling mrs. Piocosta. No, ma, wait. Ma, don't call. I swear. You kids are going to learn the value of a dollar. I'll wash your car. You never put any effort in. I will. I promise. I'll do it really good. Just don't call. I'll get the money. Forty dollars, anthony. I know, i know. Ma! How ya doin'? What brings you here? Remember that pastry place, ferrara's? Brought you some macaroons. Oh, they're too sweet. What are you talkin' about? They're your favorites. The activities director, rosie, says they're organizing a trip to the city. Dinner and a show. And you don't wanna go. I don't like the people here. You don't know the people here. And that city. Grown men soiling themselves. - It's not like that anymore, ma. - That giuliani. Maybe we should just stick to the field trip. Mothers throwin' their babies out of skyscraper windows. You're always with the babies out the windows. I don't see you tryin' to mix with the other ladies here... or talk to the nice gents i see walkin' around. You're not makin' the most of your opportunities. What do you care? Out of sight, out of mind. We don't think like that, not me or carm or the kids. I wish the lord would take me now. I come here to get cheered up. You think that's a mistake? You bein' sarcastic? You can't put all your problems on me. This is the most expensive retirement community in new jersey. If you wanted to, you could be happy here, but you're just pissing it all down the drain. What beautiful language for your mother. You want the macaroons? I don't care. Leave some out for the lunatics. Good- bye, ma. They're saying it might rain today. Don't worry. I'll drive safe. What the hell are you doing? This place is an hour from my office. An hour? What are you, a woman? Get a bladder transplant. My mother lives here. It's not real convenient for me. It's not convenient? I'm sorry. Why don't we meet by your precinct? The government would love pictures of us together. What do you got for me? Here. "Jennifer melfi, m. D." Yeah. Her background, daily routine. And your personal relationship with her is? None of your fuckin' business. You can't blame a guy for tryin'. What are you, bored with your life? Oh, yeah, sure. Bustin' whores and junkies. Plus, it's a super huge thrill to pay two alimonies on a $40, 000- a- year income. I don't want her touched. I don't want her bothered. I just want to know the who, when, why. That's it. Usual fee? The knicks lost, lieutenant. You're down two large. Lay off the vig. We'll see what kind of job you do. Okay. See you in a few days. What ya got in the box? Macaroons. This is awful. I can't deal with this. What kind of god? Hmm? Christopher! Where you been? What happened to you? What happened to you? Brendan's dead. What are you talkin' about? The fish is in my pocket. Brendan's brains are floatin' in his bathtub. Message job through the eye. - Mo green special. - Fuckin' uncle junior. What are you talkin' about, mo green? In one, mo green's eyes got too big for his stomach, so they put a small caliber in his eye. - Mikey palmice does their hits. - In his glasses, you mean. Glasses, eyes. Why you quibbling with me? I'm at the world trade center. What are you doin'? Mikey palmice is a made guy. Cocksucker didn't have the balls to do it himself. Contracted fuckin' russians and he killed my friend. Our response should suit the message. Through the mouth means the guy was a rat. The eye is just how francis framed the shot, for the shock value. Brendan didn't deserve this. Don't try to talk me out of it. You can't touch mikey. Your fuckin' uncle's pissin' on your head. What do you expect me to do? I'm on it. I know where mikey's house is over by route ten. No. He tries to leave, you break his other neck. Nurse bradley, you're wanted in e. R. Nurse bradley, you're wanted in e. R. Hey, mr. G. Q. Hey. Got a ticket. Yeah. How ya doin', mikey? How ya doin'-- son of a-- look. Your suit's wrinkled. Let me fix it. - Ow! - What are you screaming about? Free alterations. Ow! Ow! Mr. Slick. This is overdue. You hear about the chinese godfather? He made them an offer they couldn't understand. You gonna stop this before it gets out of hand? - Not even a hello? - I'm here'cause i love you and i respect you. Don't pretend you're payin' me respect. A son who throws his mother in an asylum. She lives like apoverettoup there. That's none of your business. Your friends-- they interfere in my business. They expect me to turn the cheek. The truck and all that was made good to you. I'm sitting here like patience on a monument, waitin' for discipline to be handed down. Your boys were warned, and still they embarrass me. I run my crew my way. What you did was extreme. Now you're my judge? I answer to bigger people than you, my friend. Oh? Like jackie? Wanna take this to his deathbed? That nephew of yours we gave a high colonic, uh, he earns good? He's comin' up. Okay. He works for me now. Excuse me. Maybe he gives youagito for a change. You got some set of balls. You know that? Absolutely not. I show you my hand, and you slap it away. What's the matter with you? Why can't we talk like adults anymore, hmm? Out. Next time you come in, you come heavy or not at all. You don't mean that. So by the time i get to take the sergeant exam, of course, the pay scale is frozen by law. Why are we following these people? They grabbed a meal, saw a movie, so what? Lucky for you they stopped off at that package store. - Yeah, i got a juice. - Yeah, i can smell the potatoes. Hey, listen, asshole. Same make and model left the scene of a triple homicide on long island. Stay fuckin' current. So you broke it off with the poorshlubafter a week? I know. I feel for you males. It's our goddamn fault you don't know how to act. Oh, admitting mistakes. We tell you to be more sensitive. You join promise keepers. We say get in touch with your feelings. You run off into the woods in a loincloth, gunking yourself with bear fat, beating a drum. Hey, don't ruin my evening. You know what i mean. Sure. You want someone who's sensitive to your needs... but still decisive enough for the occasional grope in the closet. Yeah. Something like that. Oh, shit. That's all i need. We were going over the speed limit? I wasn't looking. Pull over. License and registration, please. Uh, i'm sorry, officer. Did i do something wrong? Detective. You crossed a double line. Have you been drinking, sir? We had wine with dinner. Step out of the car, please. I don't believe this. Just relax, randall, and do what he says, okay? I need you to walk a straight line to me, sir. Heel to toe. Look, uh, i applaud your vigilance, but this is totally unnecessary. All right? I'm a lawyer. I know i'm under the limit. Open the trunk, please. What? You want to search my golf bag? Open it! I will not. You ever hear of probable cause? Oh, yeah, that's a real good legalese-- what? Oh, you resisting arrest? - Hey! - vin, will you fuckin' cool it? Vin! He can't do that! Get back in the car! He didn't do anything wrong! Ma'am! Back in the car. Now. Come on. Let's go. I perceived what i thought was a weapon. What the hell's wrong with you, vin? Take him. D. U. I. , resisting arrest, assaulting an officer. Do it now. What's he-- do it! Jesus. Don't you touch me! You got prime rib at home. Don't be goin' out for hamburgers. What? What are you talking about? Randall! Randall! I'll follow you! I'm gonna call my lawyer, you! Fuck you! She's seeing a randall curtin, tax lawyer. He's lives at 1242 rennsalaer road. He's divorced. He's got two kids. He's the country club type. Not much in the balls department, i might add. What about her? Her, the good doctor, she's in her office at 8:00 a. M. She leaves at 6:00. She orders up a tuna sub and a diet coke. She's got a three- bedroom condo in essex fells, shops at pathmark. She's divorced. One kid, 19. Outside of schmucko, she don't get out much, but she does see a shrink. She what? Yeah. She sees a shrink once a week. His name is elliot kupferburg. Oh, fuck me. Well, she don't fuck anyone from what i can tell. Well, it's not because she don't got the goods. She left her blinds up. I got some of them victoria secrettype snaps. If you're interested. A little of this? Good enough then? Yeah. - You got any advil? - What am i, a fuckin' pharmacy now? What you got on friday's game? I got three bills on rutgers. I don't solve all your problems. Thank you. With a stapler? Wow. I heard mikey had to give up that nice suit. Yeah? He got too attached to it. Michael palmice's been a disease since he was five. He had it comin'. It don't make things any easier though. My uncle's a stubborn man. Stubborn enough to go to war? What kind of word is that? There hasn't been a war since the columbo thing. Everybody decided. No one's goin' to the mattresses this day and age. I got a top- of- the- line posturpedic at my house. Fuck it. If jackie hadn't gotten sick, none of this would have happened. When you're right, you're right. One of us captains gotta step up. Lack of control at the top is fuckin' up this family. - That's true. - You can say that again. If the old man were here, instead of in that cell in springfield, he'd say,"raymond, this is your moment." Go easy with the grease gun, okay? What? You're the boy wonder. Both him and jackie had you picked from day one. You got the age. You got the seniority. I also got an 18- year- old with m. S. , okay? I told nucci i'd be doin' less, not more. All due respect to your crippled kid, you don't want a wire up your ass. You don't want the headache. That's why you should be boss. You're so fuckin' smart. And it's "physically challenged." Absolutely. Why don't we run this thing like a council? Larry, the old guys set this up as a paramilitary organization. We need a supreme commander at the top, not the fuckin' dave clark five. Face it. You and junior are gonna have to duke it out. You gotta be boss. Number one: I love the man. Number two: He's got new york behind him. Not for anything, god bless your uncle, but he's livin' in the wrong century, and new york knows it. You want it, t? You'll get their okay. It's the right thing. It's inevitable. I don't want no disturbance. Hey, what's up? Nothin'. I bet you told your mom what happened. What are you, high? Well, you owe me 40 bucks for the shirt. The collar was totally ripped. You still owe me for fourth of july. Bottle rockets? I paid for them. Not for the m80s. Remember? The ones you blew up the frogs with. - Oh, yeah. That was pretty cool. - Yeah. Listen. Just give me the money. - That thing was so gay. I did you a favor. - You're gonna do it. Make me, fatty. - Dick wad. - Asshole. Whoa! Shithead. Bitch-- come on. Let's go, shithead. - Let me go! - Why? So i can kick your ass again? - I was kicking your ass. - Nobody won. It was a draw. The pit tomorrow, 3:00. You gotta help me with these cinch bugs. They're killing my sweet corn. Well, this blue stuff works pretty well, and it's safe for the environment. I tried that. You got any d. D. T. Back there? Uh, that stuff's illegal. It's been banned. Maybe you got a surplus in the back, you could go, you look. I'll meet you back there. Look, mr. Soprano, if i could do something, i would-- mr. Piocosta! Right? How ya doin'? Remember our boys went to camp aheka together? Of course. Tony. How are ya? Good. Good. Your kid still got that killer crossover dribble? - Yeah, i guess so. - That's gonna get him a scholarship. - So how's anthony? - He's moody, you know? For a kid that age, you know? It was nice seein' ya, tony. Why don't we get together and cook up some dogs for the boys? Tony, i-- i don't even know if these guys are close anymore. Did anthony mention anything to you? I'll have carmela call joanie. We'll get together. - Linda. - Linda. That's great. Tony, that's great. I'll see you around. Tony? Yeah. Oh, my god. Tony? I thought the medication was supposed to help your panic attacks. It-- it does. It's the first one in a while. What does your therapist say? He should increase your dosage. He's got more degrees than a thermometer. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Does your therapist ask questions about our marriage? I know that personal feelings are hard for you to talk about. Talk. That's all we do is talk. Carm, i'm gonna quit. Did you bring this up with him? Yeah. He knows. I guess. Oh, shit. I forgot to take my fuckin' prozac this mornin'. It's up in the bathroom. Can you get it? I know with jackie sick you're under tremendous pressure. But i feel if the therapy didn't hurt, it wouldn't be helping. No, you don't understand. That's why you're in therapy. Because i don't understand! I'm telling you, tony, if you give up now, i'm gonna have to reevaluate things. What is that, huh? I got a very sensitive job. I'm not an average joe on the block. I gotta spell it out for you? It's our marriage, tony! Therapy is too much exposure. Fine! You live with the results then! What's that, a threat? No, tony. It's a rave review. You get your own fuckin' pills. How long did the attack last? About 30 seconds. I was dizzy, out of breath. That's it though. I never lost consciousness. Anything since? I'm gonna write a script for xanax, just for a couple of days. It'll get you over this short- term stresses. My uncle. He's got me in a box where i gotta do something i don't wanna do. And then there's my mother. I pay four grand a month for this place, and she acts like i'm an eskimo, pushing her out to sea. She's testing. Same as your uncle. Like little kids. There's a good book about this. I'll give you the name. No, i read, i go right out. It'sstrategies for coping with elder family. Can't fuckin' spank'em though. Would it hurt you to let your mother think that she's still in charge? You have children. You know what they're like. You know that sometimes it's important to let them have the illusion of being in control. Chris, my man! Surprised to see me? Heard they took you for a little ride. Tour of the meadowlands. Oh, yeah? Heard you had a little b. M. Out there. - So you got my cut? - They came and took it. - Who? - Junior soprano's boys. They said you was out, and it's they corner now. - You let them do that? - I don't argue too well suckin' on a smith & wesson. - You didn't beep me? - Word on the street, you out of commission. Sorry, man. Business. Chris, you know there's no one i'd rather give my ten points to than you. It's all right. It's not your fault. Oh, i'm glad that you say that, man. Sneaky motherfucker! Oh, shit! Oh! I don't care if they shove a scud missile up your ass. This is my corner. You pay anyone but me, i'm comin' back for your thumbs. And that didn't happen, what you said! I'm gonna kill you! If you get in trouble, go for the takedown. Sweep kick and steamroll. Game is over. All you're doing is makin' me nervous. Do you want a nitro bar? Would you shut the fuck up? - He's coming! - It's the moment of truth. Here. - What the hell is that? - Just take it. I'll fight you for it. - I can't. - What do you mean, can't? Just take it! I knew you'd chicken out. Man! He chickened out. He's scared. Oh, yeah! He's real scared ofyou. What's that supposed to mean? You won, man! Yeah! Tonio, you won! I'm leaving. Boo! One of the gangland's youngest alleged leaders... died late this afternoon at st. Isaac's hospital. Turn it off. Turn the music off! Giacomo "jackie" aprile, allegedly one of the state's top mafia figures was first hospitalized last year. Authorities called aprile the acting boss for 74- year- old ercoli "eckley" demeo, currently serving a life sentence in springfield federal penitentiary. Authorities believe he was made acting boss for the north jersey mafia two years ago. Aprile was 44 years old. Thank you, heather, for that live report. Goddamn it. I was just there. They told me he wouldn't go today. It looks like the possibility of rain for this weekend. I'll never forget where i was this day. It's okay. He was a good man. Let's do a toast. Give me a toast. To a great man. To a great leader. A great friend. To jackie. Buonanima. Buonanima. T! Ya hear what happened? Just now. That's not all. I go to make a pickup from yo yo mendez. He says it ain't my corner anymore. It's junior's. Christopher. This ain't the time. They're movin' in! I say we go to defcon 4! I gotta assess this, all right? What are we, politicians? Does this look like the senate to you? - Hey, hey. - This is about respect of our thing! Why don't you shut the fuck up? It doesn't concern you! Yes, it is. I represent you out there, and i'm tired of puttin' my tail between my legs. This ain't negotiation time. This isscarface, final scene. Fuckin' bazookas under each arm. Say hello to my little friend. Always with the scenarios. You don't do somethin', i gotta question your leadership. What the-- you ungrateful little fuck! Where'd you get the balls to question my leadership, huh? I'm just sayin' how it is. I ought to rip your fuckin' head off and finish the job. You're the boss. That's right. I am. You're lucky a man i loved died today. Here we go, the war of'99. We should go with him. You do what you're told when you're told. Adios, junior. Mind your mother now, hear me? Never mind. A little more. That's good right there. Right there? Yeah, that's good. All right. Here! Take this. Uncle junior. I need to talk to ya. I came in heavy, like you said, but i don't wanna use it. Our friend jackie has died. I heard. Now we need a leader. We do. And i don't want any confusion or misunderstandin'. Yes? Sopranos have been waiting a long time to take the reins. That's why i want it to be you, uncle jun. This is your decision? It is. You speak for the captains? I can. Come here. You crazycialtrone. You had me worried there. You think i'm gonna mess with a guy like you? You been pumpin' iron? You're stronger than a bull. Hey, call parcel's. Give this guy a tryout, huh? Come here. Always the bullshitter. Just one thing, one thing. You know i can't be perceived to lose face, right? So, bloomfield... and the paving union. It's my asking price. Congratulations. I almost got in a fight today. Fight? With jeremy piocosta. I take french with his brother. He's such a poseur. Who won? No one. He backed out. Phil litto said, "yeah, he's real scared of you." When i asked what that meant, they all laughed. Duh. What do you mean? Sometimes you're so naive. What do you think dad does for a living? Waste management. Do you know any other garbage men who live in a house like this? Uncle jackie. And why do we call him uncle when he's not even related? He's in dad'sotherfamily. Come here. I'll print it out for you. Hi. Jennifer. I tried calling. Yeah, the phone's off the hook. Come on in. I guess we won't be going to dinner. I'm worried, jennifer. I think i'm starting to lose it. I was standing in line this morning in the doughnut shop. A man in a booth looked at me. All of a sudden, i started shaking uncontrollably. Lady says,"next." I ran away. Hey. You've been through a very traumatic experience. I hate to admit this, but i'm afraid to go outside. I...got this crazy idea that i'm being followed. And this song keeps running through my head. "People are strange." The doors. Where faces look evil when you're alienated. Randall-- dead at 27 in a paris bathtub. Okay, i think you should go and talk to mel gelbar. He specializes in post- traumatic stress disorder. Y- you couldn't prescribe something? I'm your date, not your doctor. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. No. Saw my first dead body when i was about 15, maybe 16. Won't tell you about how he got clipped, because it was, uh-- sorry. You okay? I was thinking. I guess i live a sheltered existence. How so? Well, i'm in this room for ten hours a day. I guess i'm out of touch with the... climate of rage in american society, the casual violence. Your voice is all tight. This week my friend got beat up... by a policeman, no less. Oh, yeah? It was a nightmare. Wow. I mean, i don't know if this cop... was crazy or drunk or what. But he was raving, "prime rib, hamburger." It was surreal. Fuckin' moron. I mean, it sounds like this guy is a fuckin' moron. My friend's filing suit against the city. But the worst part of it is, my relationship with him will never be the same. Sorry. Oh, it wasn't your fault. Hey, this is your session. I'm sorry. This is-- hey. Very unprofessional. No, it's all right. You had your wits scared out of you. Is the xanax helping? Fine. No more attacks. But you still have your doubts? About therapy? No, no, no, no. Give it another chance. Got a lot of good ideas here. Okay. On how to cope. Tell me why this was a smart move to make junior the big willie. Look at him. He's content. Thinks he's the king of kings. Truth is, every decision is made by me. I still worry about the money end. That's'cause that's what you do. You worry. He doesn't know we kick back to jackie. We're gonna do good. Point is, he's got the title. He's a happy fuckin' camper. The house is secure. Yeah, only now we got a brand- new lightning rod on top to take the hits. Smart. Very smart. Yeah, and now you got bloomfield and the union chair. Otherwise you'd fuck me, larry, but you wouldn't respect me in the morning, would ya? As long as you guarantee to keep the old fart in line. Hey, i still love that man. I'm his favorite nephew. Look at him over there with my ma. Those people went through world war ii. Thank you. T, check out the government. Shooting right to left.
