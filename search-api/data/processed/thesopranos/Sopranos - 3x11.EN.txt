No, i'm sorry, he's not. Who's calling? This is mrs. Washington from the high school for little anthony. Mrs. Washington? From your son's school. Hello. Tony, it's me. I'm sorry to call you. I know we are broken up, but my religious medal, i look everywhere and i think i lost it. I think it's on the stugots. Oh, okay. Who is on the boat with you? I'll be sure and tell him. Alright. Is your son okay? Attendance shit. Two weeks, not eve n a kiss hello? I'm sorry, yeah. How was morocco? Great. Listen... that phone call... it was an old girlfriend. Oh, you mean she wasn't from the school? My god, she sounde d so convincing! I'm just trying to be honest here. If you're trying to be honest, why'd you lie? I didn't want to piss you off. So, it's really more about you, then. What are you talking about? I didn't want to hurt your feelings. No, what you said was that you didn' t want to piss me off, which implies that you'd have to deal with me, which is more abou t sparing you than m y fucking feelings! Merry christmas. Let's go with the satin finish. Excuse me. Hello. Yeah, it's me. You know that russki, valery, works for slava? He owes sil five grand. For that oth er thing, you know.

You wanna guess? They make us money. Thank you. And the family's well? Honestly, i'm a little concerned about our daughter. What's the problem? She's dating a boy... the son of some friend s of the family actually. I think i mentioned him to you. I don't know, i guess i'm not as optimistic as i once was. She was dating a different boy, a young african- american man? Yeah, they broke up. Actually he br oke it off with her. Believe that? You didn't exactly give him much choice, tony. So now i'm responsible for her being with jackie. I'm just saying that if you hadn't been so mean to him who knows, may be she might not be with this one. I find it very interesting that you're able to ta lk about this without rancor. Actually we haven't been arguing as much lately. It's the therapy. We're learning how to communicate. 18 double word score, that's 36. No spanish. Spanish? Oh- bleek- ay? Oblique. Indirect, not straightforward. Come on, you're in college. I'm not an english major. As in, how'bout giving me some? Jackie, i'm sick. I know, i'm only kidding. Unless you want to. Jackie. I'm kidding, kidding. Wanna do some x? I'm already taking nyquil. Tired? Actually i am kinda wiped. Mind if we finish this tomorrow? Okay. Wow, you'r e burning up. I'll come by tomorrow night and bring you some echinacea. You're leaving? I better let you get some sleep. The russians? They're not all bad. How about the cuban missile crisis? Cocksuckers moved nuclear warheads into cuba, pointed'em right at us. That was real? I saw that movie, i thought it was bullshit. Who is? Kgb, openup. We didn't wake you, did we? Or the other 30 people who live here? You want? Little early, no? Look at this shit, tv, stereo, dvd. The fuck's this? Universal remote. Universal remote. Probably wiped your ass bare handed till you came to this country. So valery, you got silvio's money? Fucking silvio. Watch it, comrade. Money is on entertainment center. Better not be any rubles in there. Put remote on docking station. What? Universal remote... put down on docking station. Listen to this prick giving orders. You got some balls, my friend. Oops. Paulie. What? It was an accident. Ay, you want to fuck here, cocksucker? You come to my house! What'd you call me? Paulie, paulie, where the fuck are you? What the fuck? What'd you do? What'd, i have a choice? I think he's dying. Must've cracked his windpipe. That's it for him. What are you, a fucking doctor now? What are we gonna do? Pull the car around. "I'm feeling very sheepish." About the other day. I had no right to even answer your phone. It's alright. I'm sorry i lied. You gonna open it? It's beautiful. It's from morocco. Yeah mm- hmm.? Now i feel like a jerk, i got nothing for you. Of course you do. No, i gott a see who this is. Oh! I gotta take this. Yeah. Ton', it's me. We saw that guy, but we had a problem. It got a little physical. You were just supposed to pick up the money. We did, but he started giving us some shit. The prick sucker- punched me. Hang on. What? Hang on. Where are you now? Rest sto p, garden state. Where's the guy? With the luggage. Are you fucking kidding me? You're breaking up, i can't hear you. I said, are you fucking kidding me? It got bad, t, we had no choice. I'm supposed to meet slava later. What the fuck am i supposed to say to him? It's okay, nobody was around. What do you wanna do? You use your own judgment. But whatever you decide, you do it way the fuck away from me, you understand? Motherfucker! That was a big waste of water. Look, it was just some work shit, okay? You got ti me for lunch? You are my lunch. I gotta get back. How'bout dinner? What do you got in mind? 9:00, my house. You like london broil? Yeah. We could dump him down the shore. It's too light out , we should wait. They got a roy roger s over there, you hungry? First thing's first, chrissy. I know, i'm just sayin g, i didn't eat breakfast. Most important meal. How you doing? Let's take him down to pine barrens. That's south jersey. It's perfect, it's fuckin' deserted down there. We take him in the woods, dig a hole, end of story. With fuckin' snow all over the ground? That's some hard shit. I got a shovel i use for digging the car out. Best part is, we'll be like 20 minutes from a. C. We can get a room, freshen up, little blackjack. Fuck that, i gotta eat something. We'll go to morton's, have a steak. This way the day won't be a total loss. Things with you and carmel a seem to be going well. It's the therapy. Look, i'm gonna be honest with you. I'm seeing somebody. A patient of yours. Gloria trillo. Why gloria? Why not? She's smart, she's sexy, she's italian. Italian? Stick to your own kind, you know. What is this,"west side story" now? Do you think havin g met her in therapy holds any significance? Maybe she reminds me of you. Okay. How? Smart, sexy, she's italian. She's actually nothing like you. Well... maybe a little. Who else then? You both got great legs. Keep joking, it's your dime. Don't get jealous. It was your fault we met in the first place. The scheduling mix- up? Point is, she makes me happy. Does she seem happy to you? When she's with me. And you know what? So am i. Do you think lying to carmela in therapy is the best thing for your panic attacks? Things are going good between me and carm, you said so yourself. Yeah, it's all predicated on a lie. Predicated on my ass, what's the difference? I'm content, i'm relaxed. The bottom line is i'm a better husband and a better father. If you wanna know the truth... as much as i love my wife, being with gloria makes me happier than all your prozac and your therapy bullshit combined. What do you think? I think we should've ate. Ya! Cocksucker's still alive! Look at this, he chewed through the tape. Fuckin g piece shit! Keep hollerin', i' ll put one in your head. Fuck you fucking mother! Get the shovel, chrissy. Fuckin' freezing out here. Hey asshole, don't you know better than to wear pajamas in the middle of winter? Think this is far enough? It'll do. The fuck you doing? You think we're digging the hole? That's right, shit- head, get to work. I know the ground's kinda hard, but give it some of that siberian action. Shut up. The fuck's he saying? Who gives a shit. Keep digging. Not that it matters now, but we didn't come to your house to kill you. That mouth of yours, you gotta learn to shut the fuck up. So, how far is it to atlantic city? Motherfucker! Ah, fuck! What the fuck? I got him, didn't i? Yeah, fuck! Maybe he's stunned. How bad is it? Couple of stitches, hang on, we'll finish him up, we'll cover him with snow. You see which way he went? He's gotta be close. Half his head's probably hanging off. There's some blood over there. Where is this prick? You sure i hit him in the head? Yeah, fuckin' positive. I don't see any more blood. It's like the trail just ended. Are you gonna be home for dinner? Yeah. Alright, i'm going to the market. Maybe it's like when you cut the head off a chicken, how they keep runnin'. Fuckin' believe this? Hello? Where the fuck you been? We're down the pine barrens. Did you wrap the package? Not yet. We were abou t to, we had a little problem. What problem? The package hit chrissy with an implement and ran off. Ran off? I thought you said it was, you know... we thought it was, t. It's complicated, we'r e looking for it now. I can't hear you, you're breaking up. I said we're looking for it. It's like she gets sciatica, the whole world grinds-- ...could surive? The package? Is there any way the package could survive? Ton'! Goddamnit! Is there any way the package could survive? No t, no fucking way. It's my life and i 'll live it any way i please. Cocksucker! What? I got a meeting with slava! I could be walking into a fuckin' buzzsaw! T, hello? Fuck. What'd he say? I dunno, he's all fucking worri ed about this slava asshole. I know we're doing work with this guy. But you gotta wonder what tony's got going. None of our fuckin' business, is it? I'm a fucking captain. You got a match? My lighter's in the car. Mine, too. I'm not dressed for this shit. He's gotta be dead by now, right? How could he not be? Fuck it, let's just go. Squirrels will eat him anyway. Where'd we park? Back there, half a mile or so. You sure? 'cause i thought we kinda looped around. Four years in the army, kid. We just follow our own footprints, c'mon. Wait a minute. We walked in a circle. How's that fuckin' possible? Alright, let's reason this out. We were driving south and the sun's setting there. What good's that do us? At least we know wha t direction we're headed. Yeah, but we're still fuckin' lost!

He was cheating on me. Holy shit. We drove out to jersey, i caught them together. She was a real whore, too. Oh, my god. That's horrible. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have pressured him like that. You're bet ter off without him, meadow. I mean , he was cute, but he was really boring. You didn't know him like i did. You don't know what it's like to grow up where we did! Whatever, mead, he was such a drip. No, me wasn't, he was great! Bruno magli over here. Which way, wha t do you think? Don't matter to me. I ain't stopping till we hit cement. A lotta strange people used to live in these woods. Jackson whites, these weird looking albinos. Paulie! Christopher! First place i'm hitting is denny's. I know.

Jesus christ, look at you two! All night in this fuckin' hell hole. Alright, c'mon. C'mon, easy. Is this the spot? Yeah, but... my fucking car's gone. You sure this is where you left it? I'm positive. Is the heat on? Jesus christ, i can't feel my toes. You got any blankets? No, sorry. Turn up the heat, huh? I can't believe it, i fuckin' loved that car. Probably kids or something. What if it was the guy? You got the money? It was in the car. That's all i asked you to do, paulie. I'm sorry, t, it couldn't be helped. The guy fuckin' lunged at us. Listen, ton', i know i fucked up, but-- it's okay, really. Just forget it. What do you think, you wanna look for this guy or what? You tell me. Is it worth it? I hit him in the head, ton'. I saw it with my own eyes. Is it possible this fu ck made it outta here alive? It's hard to say. Flesh wound maybe, head shot, i don't know. On the other hand, anything's possible. You're a captain, what do you wanna do? Fuck it, let's go home. Alright. But let's be clear on this right now. If this cocksucker crawls out from under a rock he's your problem, not mine. You deal with slava, you take the heat, you pay the price. Capisce? Fine. You got mayonnaise on your chin. What? Mayonnaise, mayonnaise! I'm telling you, something's fucked up here. Because one minute she's fine, next minute she's a fuckin' lunatic! I asked you whether or not she seemed like a happy person. Oh, and by tha t i'm supposed to know she's gonna throw a fuckin' roast beef at my head? Read into things however you choose. Why does everything gotta be so hard? I'm not saying i'm perfect, but i do the right thing by my family. Doesn't that count for anything? I think we should discuss what attracted you to gloria in the first place. We been through that already. And irina before her. Depressive personality, unstable, impossible to please. Does that remind you of any other woman? Captions copyright 2001
