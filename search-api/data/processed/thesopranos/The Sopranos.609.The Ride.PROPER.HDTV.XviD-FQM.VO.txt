make your choice. who the fuck are you? - what the fuck you doing in there?</i> we're gonna miss the previews. what? tell me your earring went in the fucking drain again. i'm pregnant. i know it's my fault. i know i shouldn't have let you take off the rubber.</i> i thought we were okay. i was due for my period. my cycle's like clockwork. stop. - i'll call the clinic tomorrow. - stop talking. let's get married. what? we'll drive to a.c., make a day out of it. are you serious? christopher. i love you. - my baby. - yeah. my ex, she couldn't have kids, and i wanted 'em so bad. - the one who ran out on you? you can bet she's having some other asshole's kid, though. that fucking tramp. elzear, patron saint of zeppoles. could use a shot of lacquer. - fix that halo, too. - shh! hello. mr. gaultieri, i'm father jose. i'm mr. gaultieri. where's father felix? unfortunately he's ill. he's having bypass surgery. he asked me to fill in. you know mr. russamano from the neighborhood association. sure, paulie, chuck, how you feeling? he was an altar boy. ahh. so the feast of st. elzear. father felix brought me up to speed. i'd like to hear your ideas for this year. well, there ain't much to talk about. it's all done through our nonprofit corporation. we close the streets for five days, hire the food vendors, rides, et cetera. day two, we start the procession, push the statue up and down the block. you say a couple of prayers and that's that. all's said and done, you get your end. about that, as i was telling mr. russamano, frankly $10,000 struck me as quite low. it is what it is. look, i'm new here. i certainly don't wanna rock the boat. i realize there are certain neighborhood traditions. it's just that given the current costs, we feel an increase - is long overdue. - what kind of increase? we feel $50,000 would be a more equitable donation. - 50? - just this year, we started a soup kitchen</i> for the homeless, a reading program for bilingual children. there's less help than ever from the federal government. you think this feast pays for itself? security, electric, sanitation. - not to mention fuel costs. - yeah.</i> the way it seems to break down is you spend $18 for a city permit to close down the street, charge fees to the vendors in the thousands of dollars to lease out land that you don't even own. yeah? well, it seems to me the church has plenty in its coffers for all those pedophilia lawsuits. the parish's deal was negotiated since this was johnny soprano's feast. these are different times, mr. gaultieri. well, some things don't change. couple of days, joe vella from the honor guard will be by with the float. transfer the statue from his nitch, pick up the hat and other stuff. you say things don't change. this feast was started over 100 years ago in a spirit of giving. italian immigrants, the working poor gave what little money they had to honor st. elzear. he's the patron saint from my grandparent's town-- - ariano di puglia. - many of those folks gave their gold wedding bands, - which were melted down to make the saint's hat. - yeah? the holy society of st. elzear, of which you are recording secretary, has for the past 100 years entrusted us with the care of that habiliment. frankly... i don't feel safe giving it over this year. we use it every year. it's part of the tradition. i understand, but i'm sorry.</i> given the tenor of this conversation, i sense there's a possible criminal element in this neighborhood that could endanger this precious piece of local history. but for 50 grand, you wouldn't have that sense. it would demonstrate to me that you take this feast as seriously as the people who began it. okay, father, nice meeting you. fuck the hat! it's fucking bullshit. i got a fax from eddie lind, allegheny carting. they wanna raise the tipping fee again on solid waste. just the man i wanted to see. i gotta go down to pennsylvania and i'm gonna need backup. i'm busy managing thfeast. vice president in charge of calzones. where the fuck you been anyway? is that what i think it is? you are now looking at a newly married man. - ho-ho-holy shit! - kelli? what the fuck brought this on? visit from the stork coming up. you never heard of pulling out? sweetheart, little cristal over here. - you know what you're having? - boy, i hope. i tell ya, t, with the example you set, plus the wisdom i learned from a.a., it's an inspiration-- building blocks, home, family. yeah, that's what it's all about, kid. just water for me. - my son will be my strength.</i> yeah. i did? what are you, new in the office? talk to dr. cipolla. i don't pay for missed appointments. - to the baby. - to the baby. - salut. - salut.</i> make a note to call freddie at disorbo's. he wants to sponsor the cannoli-eating contest, i better see an envelope by tomorrow. anyway, my guy at the weigh station's on board. - you know how to get back, right? - i mapblasted it. all right, see you guys. look, pittsburgh. what the fuck? we're supposed to be headed east. are we .7 miles past route 62 yet? i gotta take a piss. you seeing this? looks like bikers. wooden crates. it's good wine. - what the fuck? - who the fuck are you guys? - that's who i am, you mangy cocksucker. - take it easy. on the ground or i'll blow your greasy fucking heads off. - you guys cops? - how's your incision, lieutenant?</i> - 10-4. - you're fucking with the vipers here, asshole. ooh, really? what's that, your girl scout troop? shut up, fucking douche bag. let's go. - get him! - ow! i hit him! i fucking hit him! fuck you! yee-ha! that was fucking awesome. fucking old school shit. opportunity knocked. knocked? kicked the fucking door in. oh, fuck! you okay, t? fucking ankle, i guess i sprained it. you smell that? it's fucking autumn. it's like the first fall night when you're a kid, and the air's all crisp, and you start smelling people's fireplaces. smells like halloween. ha ha! oh... chateau pichon-longueville, 1986. '86-- ooh, baby. show me the money. what's your corkage fee? how about that prick's face when he saw the gat? the grizzly adams motherfucker? "whoa, take it easy." "we're with the vipers." how's that wine, good? it really is, i gotta say. i tell ya, though, when he pulled that trigger, i almost shit myself. yeah. i miss it sometimes. i'll be honest. the wine. you should toast to your wedding, at least. your kid. discipline, that's all. set limits for myself. on the other side, they consider wine food. oh, yeah? - salut. - salut.</i> i'm gonna have to sleep on my back. - what are you doing? - nightcap. there's a swiss army in the console. when you think of the shit we've been through, huh? shit we've done. fucking three musketeers. we got a bond. it's very special. you saved my life in a lot of ways. you've been there for me, too, you know?

what's the matter? you know i've always been loyal to you, t. what are you trying to tell me, christopher? i can't even say it. oh, fuck. adriana. what about her? the feds. jesus fucking christ. how long?

could be distributed in long island. what's my end? 50-50, but it's gotta be done now, tonight. tonight? all right, but in this case, i'm thinking we spare john the stress of having to hear about this. the situation he's in, he's got enough to deal with. get me frankie cosme on the cell. yeah, somebody wants to talk to you. hold on. did you pray? said a "thank you" for daddy's recovery. you had arthroscopic surgery, you can't bend a knee? dad said he's gonna meet us on the corner. isn't that ade's mom? - oh my god. she looks terrible. - who? chris' ex, her mom. she saw us. i should say hello. liz, hi. i saw you're on the committee. that's so great. carmela soprano. - how's your daughter?

i have been debating all night whether to even say anything about this. i ran into liz la cerva at the feast. - yeah... - she's got it in her head that christopher killed adriana. what? that's insane. i know. then again, he does have a history of being free with his hands. that makes him o.j.? she was probably drunk. i really don't think she was. let me school you on domestic violence, okay? first and foremost, there's always a body. and 99 out of 100-- and this comes straight from my cop buddies-- it happens either in the bedroom or in the kitchen.</i> he killed her, believe me with the forensics they got nowadays, the fibers, we'd know about it. the fbi came to her house-- liz. that's exactly my point. if they really thought he did it, how fast do you think they'd haul his ass in? sour grapes, carm. he dumps her daughter, all of a sudden he's scott fucking peterson. - i thought ade dumped him. - you know what i mean.</i> she was a sweet girl, ade, but the two of them together was a toxic relationship. yeah, they did have a rough time of it. and he's doing great-- christopher. he's a different person. he's married. he's got a kid on the way. he's focused. let's not sabotage his progress. hmm? have a dozen extra large brought over to satriale's. - hello. - paul, dr. cipolla.</i> i'm on my way out. i received the results of your psa test.</i> - and? - not to worry.</i> but the numbers are a little higher than i prefer.</i> - what does that mean?

when your father gets back from the bathroom with sophia, - you can go on whatever. - it's a kiddie ride. yeah, but she wants to go on the ride with her big brother. here we go! you ready, baby? go for a ride with mama? this is too small. i'll be all squished. yeah, so you go sit in that one, and wave to her. oh, there's my girl. there's my girl! yeah, are you ready to go on the ride with mama? are you ready? get ready.</i> yeah, we're gonna go soon.</i> oh, here we go! all around the floor. wipe that puss off your face. wee-hee! - my baby! - oh my god, call an ambulance! excuse me! - it's okay. it's okay.</i> this is a temperature gun. 217°. look at that. - yeah. - paulie, it's me.</i> we had a problem down here. the ride-- the teacups or whatever, a bolt busted. thing jammed up. - some people got hurt. - where's the guy who owns it?</i> he's talking to the cops. fine, fuck it. what do you want from me?

nothing. i was taking sophia to the bathroom. mmm, this wine, tony, you're right. delicious. i was just thinking it lost some of its... i don't know-- pop. manager. you gotta move your car.</i> i said i'm coming. you redneck fuck. my baby was on that ride with my wife. she woke up this morning, she could barely move her neck. i told the cops, mister. i'm sorry. insurance will pay your hospital bill. - $25,000 cash. - what? new jersey has stringent liability laws. i told the guy who hired me i'd have to put on a whole repair crew, work 'em all night. he wouldn't spring for it. who, paulie? what are you talking about? first off, he wouldn't pay for my "a" fleet. i leased that to the sorghum festival down in atlanta. okay, the results of the steroid test are in.</i> - the contestants, they're all clean. i want a fair contest here.</i> no biting each other. ready, set, mangia. man, we got some race going on over here, ladies and gents. look at 'em go. hey, cocksucker! you hire some fly-by-night piece of shit and you don't tell nobody? - whoa, bobby. - what the fuck you talking about? - you know what i'm talking about, you cheap fuck! - bobby, come on! everybody wants to get rich, but you don't scrimp on safety. - mind your business, bobby. - my baby girl was in that car! - you owe me money, paulie. - i owe you shit. - my wife's got nerve damage! - fuck her, too! - get the fuck off me! - easy, easy. calm down. keep moving. go ahead, it's over. crown the winner. i was at the feast, st. elzear's. the thing for us kids was to blow powdered sugar on each other from the zeppoles. thousands of people either praying or eating. anyway, my sister was on this ride</i> with my niece when it lurched forward - pretty bad. - god. he wasn't there, just elzear. but he was so busy getting money pinned to his ass - that he got distracted and a bolt snapped. were they hurt? you look around, all these people are lined up for this shit. the kids, adults, families. rides. yeah, they pay money so they can almost puke. they scream, they yell. why do you think that is? they're bored. are you bored? am i bored? i got shot in the pancreas and i recovered. no brain damage from the septic shock, like everybody figured i'd have. you know my feelings. every day is a gift. it's just... does it have to be a pair of socks? i'm joking. i'm joking. well, what are you gonna do? it's the human condition. what is? i don't know. yeah, this is peter gaultieri. i'm calling for the result of my biopsy again.</i> i'm sorry, sir. they're still not in.</i> this is cancer we're talking about. i understand, sir. you'll have to call back tomorrow.</i> gimme an espresso... and don't touch the lemon rind with your fingers. hello, paulie. what are you doing here? the home. it's one of our outings. so you're still over there, huh? they've been very nice, and your brother's trying to work out an arrangement. is it true what they're saying? who? about what? the ride, the one that broke. you need to make a novena, paulie. - those poor children. - what are you talking about?</i> you let st. elzear go without his hat. will you listen to this? fuck that voodoo, huh? you cursed your mother, a blessed nun. she had it coming. you both did. i didn't bring you up like that. you're a fake. that's how you brung me up. fuck the two of you. sir, your espresso. so in keeping with this longstanding tradition of doing everything ass-fucking-backwards, we are gathered here tonight for the bachelor party of already-married man christopher moltisanti. and like i always say, a man is not complete till he's married. then he's finished. chrissy. - congratulations. t. - thanks. should we order?

this thing with the ride, the shit with bobby, you settle it and you settle it now. and not just 'cause she's my sister, either. - ton', i-- - you put little kids in jeopardy at the hands of some fucking redneck? not to mention you leave little paulie alone to deal with the cops. i thought he had it under control. let me ask you a question about the feast. do we need negative press? with all the competition out there for the entertainment dollar, dvds, the internet? you're right, ton'. what happened to the regular ride guy, the guy we used last year? for what he wanted to charge, i'm getting killed here, ton'. when your dad had st. elzear's, it was a cash cow, and it was easy. nowadays, between paying the church, these puerto ricans now, ha, my profit shrunk to nothing. if it don't work as a business, get rid of it. not for nothing, but a lot of that feast goes in your pocket. i got a lot on my mind, t. - i'm sorry. - like what? i had a biopsy. i might have prostate cancer. well, it's a biopsy, right?</i> nine times out of 10, these things come back clean. - i don't know. - what don't you know? don't work yourself up into a state like you do, hmm? i've been having headaches. i'm afraid maybe the thing metastasized. jesus, will you listen to yourself, huh? with all your weird fucking shit about your body and the germophobias. - you don't know shit yet. - it's true. i'd rather face 10 guys with shivs than something i can't see. exactly. you're too susceptible to the psychics and the dream messages and dirty fucking toilet seats. it's a biopsy. get a grip. you're right, t. you know, and negative thinking can help bring this shit on. work something out with bobby, huh?</i> and eddie lind's coming down from pennsylvania with an envelope. meet him at the bing. you call him, you set up a time. there he is, the bad lieutenant. hey. i sold mine. $300 for the five cases. oh, i had a heater put in the bloomfield wire room. guys were complaining. well, good. yeah, yeah, that's good. what's new with you?
