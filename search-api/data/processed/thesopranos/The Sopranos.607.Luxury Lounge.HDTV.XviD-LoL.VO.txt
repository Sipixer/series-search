no, i'm all set here. thanks. martina, sweetheart, can i talk to you for a second? what is it, artie? you're looking at me very serious. you remember i had that friend in manhattan that was gonna help speed you through the green card process? apparently, it's not happening. - why? - too much on his plate, he said. i guess you're just gonna have to do it yourself. i'm sorry. all those forms. shit me. i wish i could help you, but really, it's a small inconvenience compared to living in freedom, right? yes, i know this. get him another 'buca. hey, tony. you could fuck her, you know? well... i'm not 100% in that department,</i> but i'm startin' to feel the old pressure. it's funny, 'cause guys like me, we come here, we get drunk and stare. best-case scenario, we go in the back room, we get a lap dance a dry hump and pfft-- blow in our pants. listen, you wanna fuck her so bad, i'm sure it could be worked out. nah, i couldn't. but you... well, what do you want me to say? nothing. it's just a fact. if i knew you were gonna be in such a pissy mood-- gabriella dante and rosalie aprile came in for lunch yesterday. so what, you wanna fuck one of them now? no. gab said you all went and had a meal at da giovanni on sunday. well, i was gonna tell you. it was phil's grandson's confirmation. it's a pain in the ass. what are you gonna do? you gotta eat. it's nothing' special, believe me. actually, carm got a little sick after. too much oil, she thought. gab said i should check it out, like i could learn something. well, she runs her mouth, that one. fuck her. carm got sick. nice touch. it was a business obligation, artie. uh-oh. last time i heard that, i had to call the fire department. well, maybe you need another fresh start to fuck up. i should go. - oh, come on, come on. - no. - i'm sorry. have another one, come on. - forget it. i know where your heart is. i gotta plan the menu for tomorrow. fasanella, my old man's a meat guy. he said that the restaurant business was like keeping an elephant. it costs a fortune and sooner or later it shits on your head. i miss him. hector had to trim three inches off the fiorentinas. great. we can't even get the good meat anymore. fucking western beef is leaving us for dead. i wanted you to call their guy, but you were on the floor talking to the cohen's mother-in-law. you can't deal with the westeeef guy yourself, my blushing flower? it's not the same from me. and arthur, the chatting with the guests... again, that's it. it's not hector or the meat or these assholes that are always looking for the next hot thing. it's me. limit it to a quick visit at coffee. people wanna talk to each other, not you. really? you know better than new jersey zagat-- "arthur bucco, warm and convivial host"? yeah, we're here right now. sure, the broad strokes. perfect. kingsley's agent says we grab lunch tomorrow, poolside. - that guy, jay? - yeah, i got him out of some trouble on a party yacht down in the keys. ben kingsley, can he do a new jersey accent? welcome to the viceroy. i usually send the bags up, hit the bar, decompress a little, unless you're against it. - what are you talking about? - you're in aa. you gave the stewardess an earful when she put down the champagne. i just don't wanna make you feel uncomfortable. relax. i can deal with it. be careful with this wine, because the way you two are looking at each other, pretty soon we're gonna have to... - put a high-chair right here. did you clip the daily-special cards to all the menus? hey, artie, c'mere. you ready to order? why you kicking her ass like that? if you're referring to the fact that she's my employee and i'm telling her what to do, last time i checked, that's the way it works. she thinks you want her to cry. i said not true. she told you that? 'cause you two talk all the time. - yeah. so what? - so, maybe you should hire her.</i> i know how to treat people. - you're a people person, obviously. - i am. and when they're good to me, they get treats. and when they're not, well, i got this severance thing i do. it's a complete break, actually. i get it. see, 'cause you talked around that threat so much, i almost missed it. sorry to interrupt you guys, but, arthur, you have to plate the salmon. arthur, the kid is a hood, okay? if he feels protective of his girlfriend, you should just leave it alone. she's a slow learner. she's a nice girl, and as predicted, the customers love her with her little stories from the old country. you are just picking on her. it's disgusting. he's a married man. so it's 500 for the hour, 300 for half. and if you wanna keep skiing, that's extra. all right, eden, how's about 400 for 40 and four more lines and then we'll take it from there? that'll work. fuckin'-a. those are some amazing tits. thank you, sweetie. carlo's running late. route 23, they think there's a sniper. listen, the other night-- it's this place. you know, the rope's a little tight at my collar. down 40% from last year. - you need a little help? - from you? god no. oh, there's the gratitude i was looking for. no, i mean i'm not at that point, thank god.</i> but thank you. well, listen, the other day i was driving along and i was thinking about your little problem. how about a little promotion? a coupon, two-for-one? two-fers, wow. you mean, like you get a free spaghetti and meatballs if you bring another cheap gomer douche-bag in here? how about an early-bird special? salad wagon? this is a fine dining establishment. i'll give it back to the bank before i turn it into a fucking ihop. just send the waiter over here. you wanna help me so badly? try paying your tab. - excuse me? - that little roast you and the waste management people threw for dick barone when he got sick-- 40 fucking garbagemen from around the country. of course you paid pat cooper. you paid the entertainment. afternoon. we're looking for arthur bucco. - that's me. - dave kloski. this is jim hollings. american express? funny, i had you two for cops. in a past life. actually we're here to investigate some recent irregularities in charge activity here at nuevo vesuvio. "nuovo." irregularities? well, there is credit card fraud going on in this restaurant. - that's impossible. - based on cardholder disputes, we show nine hits in this locus that precede fraudulent activity. - what does that mean? - people's card numbers were copied and those numbers were used to rack up thousands of dollars in phony charges. wait, you think i'm ripping off my own customers? that's insane. were these meals actually served? shit. councilman carillo? that was just two weeks ago. so you understand we have to suspend the use of our cards here pending an investigation.</i> suspend? you're cutting me off? what's going on? they're from amex. no more charges. - what?! - someone's stealing! guys, this is like 30% of my business here and i can't fucking spare it right now! artie, please don't curse. the minute you use profanity, you give them the high moral ground to do whatever they please. we need copies of your reservations and a list of anyone who has access to customer plastic. i'm just asking, jay. well, tell me again. why am i meeting with these chaps? oh! oh, bollocks, jay. uh-- bollocks! oh, please. anyway, we appreciate that your time is less than limited, so i'll cut to the chase. log line-- "the ring" meets "the godfather." wiseguy-- murdered, i guess you could say-- seeks revenge on the man who ordered it. you would play that man. which man? who are we kidding here? you're ben kingsley. you'd play the boss. i heard this idea-- i call jay and i say, "sir ben kingsley, no one else." well, you know, as ever, it's script-dependent. oh, we got a sensational writer-- jt dolan. i'm embarrassed. i haven't heard of him. he's from tv-- "nash bridges," "hooperman," and "law & order, the s.u.v." so there's a script? we wanted to surmise your interest and then tailor the part to your specificities. no one plays a tough, ruthless, hard-hearted prick like you do. you got it down, trust me. i take that as quite a compliment. sure.

nobody's looking at anybody. - i didn't take the toilet paper. - but the olives? i'm joking here. i'm just saying if you don't come clean to us, those investigators, well, they just might question the honesty of somebody that wears a coat pulled from the lost-and-found. - fuck this! - no, fuck you! - arthur... - i don't know which one of you pieces of shit did this, - but i've been good to you! - ...getting us nowhere. and you pay me back with nonstop ass rape! well fuck all of you! you know what?

'cause you're a very important person. to them, i guess. murmur's an interesting name. what's the genesis? i had a heart murmur when i was a kid. they just keep handing stuff out, huh? the coolest shit in the world to the people who need it the least. look. i think you've misunderstood something. i give most of that stuff away to homeless shelters, the rest i give to charity auctions. - not to your godson? - i agree with you, the whole thing's obscene, and it's nothing compared to the situation at award shows. presenters get about $30,000 worth of merchandise in those baskets. that's a year's salary for some people.</i> go figure. hopefully we can spread some of that lolly around. we'll get you that script. hell of a tub here, guys. sea, sun. i'm gonna make it my second home. - anybody else hungry? huh? - we'll get lunch started. - artie, another margarita? - i could say no, but i won't. you lost your fucking mind? the shit you're in with that kid, which you brought on yourself. brought on myself? oh, i suppose you let a certain element into your world, you're asking for it. - oh! - jesus fucking christ, tony, - how could you pull that scam at my place? - come on, you know i never would've let that happen if i'd known. you're innocent, i get it. i'm justther victim - of benny fazio, criminal mastermind. - that's right. and once you found out, instead of putting him in the e.r., you should've come to me. he says he's gonna kill you, artie. i can't take american express now, ton'. you know what that means? i have to start with the fucking two-fers. my accountant insisted. are you happy? life's not fair. right, i know. but somehow i believe my dad's crap about honest work. he used to say to me, "you'll see. pays off in the end." what a joke. i hate to see you like this, you know that. 'cause you start thinking crazy shit. who's hungry? - yeah? - ben kingsley passed. fuck. you know, i tried to be his friend, i sent a muffin basket with the script, i tried everything. you can kill me after if you want, - but he's a fucking dead man. - calm down, ben. he came to my house, tony, where my wife was watching tv. my wife, who's carrying my unborn son. i'm gonna take him to that warehouse in paterson - and drive fucking... - nails into his balls. i know. i heard you the first time. - you're having a son, huh? - they showed us his cannoli on the ultrasound like a month ago. that's beautiful. oh, congratulations. thank you. i'm gonna tell you this once--</i> it's over. you drop it. and frankly you should be very happy i'm not gonna tax you. i mean beside the fact you know i grew up with the man, you don't shit where you eat. and you really don't shit where i eat. i know, and i'm sorry about that, but-- and your parents' anniversary party? it's not going to be at da giovanni's. it's gonna be at vesuvio. what? tony, look at my face. he's going to apologize to you, and give you a rate. he's hurtin' too. and it's the least you can do. well ms. bacall, your limo is second in line there. oh, well i can take it from here. - you sure? - yeah, thank you so much. - okay, you're welcome. - good night. night. - get the fuck away from me! - what are you doing?! somebody help us! those guys! ms. bacall, don't move. yes, an ambulance by robinsons-may. oh jesus, my fucking arm. - hmm? - no. there's a line outside. okay, push the scampi. wholesaler says they gotta get eaten tonight. and don't spread out too much. we still got the fazio party in the banquet room. okay, sandy. open the door. hello. welcome. do you have low-salt selections? ma, pop, order whatever you want. i'm having that loin of veal. that's the other place, ma. this the young couple? yes, my mom and dad. cent'ann'! - hundred years! - cent'anni! well, i hope you all enjoy. you're all set for wine, cocktails? - nothing? - fine, thanks. benny, can i get you a martina? - excuse me? - a martina. it's like a martini, but it's from albania. hmm. i never heard of it. well, apparently they go down real easy. right, ben? we're gonna look at the menu. good enough. - you order for me. - fine. the monkfish.</i> there's such a strange consistency.</i> - ow! - in front of my wife?! fuck! jesus! fuck, my hand! shit! oh god! oh fuck! fuck! my hand! oh my god! oh my god! oh my god, arthur! somebody call 911 please! look at this. i had no idea. i'd have booked another flight.</i> fuck. where is everybody? my father-in-law don't wanna come. him and carm aren't speaking. - how's the meathook? - had to be my fuckin' saute hand, huh? why, you got an okay crowd here today. sunday pasta's the last thing to go. the place is on life-support ever since word got out to the regulars about their credit cards. and my staff is pissed off about martina leaving. benny did a real number here, tony. who knows? maybe it's cursed. the fire, then this. will you stop talkin' like an old lady? - artie. - no go, huh? he's just being dramatic. - how are you, sweetie? - better. and carm, the flowers... tonight, only the best for the best people. hmm, that's excellent. hey, be careful you two, because the way you two are looking at each other, pretty soon we'll have to put a high-chair over here. like the icing on a cake, okay? capisce? keep your thumbs out of the food. we gotta talk about your problem. oh, great. another idea. how 'bout a strolling accordionist? i'm gonna give you the name of a good psychiatrist. she's italian. you'll like her. you know what? you go about in pity for yourself. - i go about in pity for myself? - yeah. i gotta tell you, bodhisattva, that is fucking priceless. use the other door. you bitch and you moan and you blame everybody else for your problems, instead of maybe... not letting the mexicans do all the cooking for you or, i don't know, changing the menu or changing the decor. i guess because you know how to eat, you know how to run a restaurant. on one of the bleakest nights of my life, after the shit with my mother and that fuckin' storm outside, i came here to this place. i sat out there with carm and my two kids and we ate and we drank and we were so happy to be here, more than any other place in the world. and you know i'm gonna eat here until i fall off the chair. but in business, sometimes shit happens. the playing field changes, whatever. and you gotta do whatever you gotta do to keep your dick up. if you hate it here so much, why don't you go to da giovanni? see ife'll cook you that bland shit for your shot-up pancreas. i'll tell you one thing and this is very hard. nobody wants to hear you talk. they're trying to eat out there and you come along with your corny jokes and your stupid stories. just stay in the kitchen. that'd be a start. hey. you wouldn't believe what these people in the business get, totally fuckin' absolutely gratis. yeah, i hear the streets are paved with hand-jobs. right. i scored some major swag. a little taste for you. trip to australia, first-class vouche, some kind of golf resort. looks like sarasota. after what, a 20-hour flight?
