"just wait till we take the pacifier out of his ass." right, yeah. Oh, fuck me! Accident! Accident! God fucking damn it! Corrado, what happened? Oh, jesus christ on the cross. It's all right. Come on. I'm an old man. It was an accident, for christ's sake. You're on ditropan specifically to avoid incontinence. Not to mention celexa, which should be curtailing your aggressiveness. I'm taking my medication. Ask hormel, you don't believe me. Jameel. He's been let go. Mr. Soprano, there's a mutual trust among the staff and our patients regarding treatment. That means you have a choice... You can either wear depends while you await transfer to another facility, or you can take your medication as prescribed. Here, corrado. Time for your medicine. Where the fuck is my ipod? Every day it's your ipod, carter. Just stop causing a commotion! What'd you do that for? I should piss myself again? But I did the thing.
