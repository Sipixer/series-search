My cousin came through on those day- spa certificates. Excellent. How's outside Daffy's, at 11:00? Perfect. You want some lunch? I was just gonna sit down to a tuna san. - Onions, in the morning? - Actually, it's 2:00. I'm going out by the pool. What, Mom? You were gonna get up at 8:30 to be at TCBY Yogurt... when the manager got there. It's, like, five days till school starts. Why get a job now? I don't know. A few textbooks you could buy. Pairs of socks. Anything that we don't have to supply. This thing about working between now and start of classes... is about you being pissed'cause I didn't intern at the Paper Mill Playhouse. We bought you a car so you could drive back and forth to your internship. You don't feel bad that you didn't live up to the deal? Jesus, we've been through this how many times? There was no stagecraft in what they had me doing at the Playhouse. Xeroxing does not count towards a drama minor internship. Did you call the drama department, check that out? I didn't, so can we shitcan the courtroom theatrics? Watch your mouth. Like I haven't been through enough this year. 12 credits, 2 semesters in a row, and I'm not entitled to a summer? You hardly.... Hello? Are you kidding? Listen, can I call you back? You hardly broke a C, Meadow, your entire second semester. Maybe you forgot my ex- boyfriend died? Your grades were going down while you were still going out with Jackie. Great. Jesus, did you ever lose a friend at my age? Did you ever have to grieve when you were 19? Honey, you should've been working this summer... to feel good about yourself... get your mind off Jackie, instead of laying out by that pool. I read, Mom, out by that pool. Probably half the canon. "The canon." Okay, what is that, now? "Now"? The great books? Western literature? Dead white males? Who even in their reductionism... have quite interesting things to say about death and loss. Maybe more interesting than what you have to say. Is Mary Higgins Clark a part of that group? 'Cause that's what I saw you reading every time I passed by the pool. Hello? You're not surprised, are you? Come on, he's so totally duplicitous. He had the nerve to come to the pub- crawl? Can I call you back? Are we done talking? Did you go on- line and register for your classes? - I will. - Just go. There's some guy in your driveway with a ponytail. What is his story? - Hi, Mrs. Sop'. - Hello, Misty. Fur', hi. He'll be down in a second. He's just changing. He was working outside this morning. - Do you want some coffee? - Sure. I'm gonna buy a house, you know? - I didn't. Where? - Nutley. So you're gonna stay? You gonna become a citizen, too? You don't need that. - How's it going, Ton'? - Here at Peaceful Acres? Just swell. I don't got time for coffee. Drop me off at the mechanic's, so I can pick up my car. Then I got an appointment, and I'll drive myself, all right? Later. - Say goodbye to Mead' for me. - Why don't you say goodbye yourself? I'll tell you what a gold mine is, those Harry Potter books. That's'cause it gives the other kids, the 98- pound weaklings, some hope. Speaking of 98 pounds... I hear Ginny Sack's getting a 95- pound mole taken off her ass. That's some guy's wife, come on! All right, gentlemen, I got to go. - Talk to Patsy. - Happy birthday. - All right. - So long. - See you, guys. - See you, Ton'. Happy birthday, Al. I understand we got some business to discuss. The floor is yours. Go on, tell him. I drove out to Youngstown to see Uncle Paulie... and he was, I don't know... hoping you could settle this shit with Ralph... and the no- show carpenter jobs. Ralph. Okay, for the record, I had my guy go over the books. We can do maybe two carpenter jobs, one no- show, one no- work. Two jobs. On a $300 million project? Come on. What's the real number? What? Am I speaking in tongues, here? Two. Maybe I can do three. - My uncle's looking for at least 10. - I'm talking, here. The guy's in the can. You think you want to keep him happy, maybe? All right. Here it is. And this comes from.... For the duration, you will give Paulie five carpenter jobs... two no- shows and three no- works. One of the no- shows, our friend in Youngstown keeps... and one, he gives to Chrissy here. The others, the no- work jobs, that's for Paulie... how he wants to distribute them. It is so decreed. - Now, if there isn't anything else? - There is something else. With Paulie in the can, there's a new acting capo of his crew. It's Chrissy. That's the way certain people want it... and we trust there will be no ill will. This is fucking great! I mean, I know I'm just the acting, but still-- It's a big responsibility. I got it covered. First thing I'm doing is getting wings in my hair. You know, like Paulie. I'll talk to you later. See these crystal paperweights? Last year, I bought the Christmas gifts... for the entire Jets front office. Over 600 of these, shaped like footballs. - You ever get tickets? - Lost the account. To better times. That's so adorable, with the animals shaped like letters. - I know. If I ever have a baby.... - Yeah. - What? - Nothing. Christopher talks about having kids, once in a while. I don't know. - Where is our angry young man? - Out with his friends, I guess. I used to date this one guy, Vinnie. He was more like a fuck buddy, but he lived on Staten Island. I swear, we'd be in the middle of doing it, and if his goddamn beeper went off... then he'd just leave. I think he was, like, connected, or something. He used to carry a gun. It was probably just to protect himself. I mean Christopher does, too, sometimes. - When you're in a cash business-- - Stocks is a cash business? Can I tell you something? Sure. I don't think I can have kids. What? Why? I can't believe I'm telling you this. It's just that I feel really close to you. A long time ago, before Christopher even... I had an abortion. I didn't want to. I know it was wrong... but the guy was such an asshole, it was really the best thing. Anyway, there were complications. My gynecologist says that there's a good chance... I won't be able to hold a pregnancy. Oh, God, I can't believe I'm telling you this. Christopher don't even know. My own mother even. Sometimes it helps to talk. They can do incredible things these days, Ade. When the time comes... I know a great ob- gyn that my sister went to in the city. Really? You just show up without calling? I thought you were going out. I'm a man of many mysteries. Danielle, this is Christopher's friend, Paulie Germani. Hey, how you doing? You put this in the back of your freezer, it'll take out any odors. Go on, buy her a drink somewhere. I got to talk to my fianc√©e. - Some manners? - I'll call you tomorrow. So what? You from around here? Something's wrong with that broad. - Something's wrong with you. - Oh, yeah? Here's what's wrong with me. Holy shit! Oh, my God. - These diamonds-- - Harry Winston, baby. It's got more carats than Bugs Bunny. I had a great conversation with Silvio today. What? Tell me. Let's just say that Carmela ain't gonna be First Lady forever. Political disagreement is often a catalyst... leading to violence in a world gone mad. Burning rage in Korea spilled onto the street with deadly results. Check it out. Guy in the red jacket? In 10 seconds, that cop's a fucking fireball. I don't think I want to see this. Janice! Fuck, it's my brother. I'm coming. What are you doing here? I was nearby, at Bacala's. Figured I'd come by, say hello. Good. - How's he doing? - He's fat. Faces of Death? What? Was The Sound of Music already rented? It's research for our Christian rock video... I'm coordinating with the record release. That Tommy Mottola, he's one slow motherfucker. - What's it been, about a year? - Actually, we are not going with Sony. We're considering a smaller, independent label. Naturally. Got any coffee? I may only have soymilk. What? What do you care? - It's none of your business, anyhow. - Ralph Cifaretto? It's always fucking something with you. Why don't you stay out of other people's living rooms? Jesus Christ. You look good. Better than last time. Ralph came through with those jobs. - What did Tony say? - It was Tony made him do it. I wished Albert "happy birthday" for you. Who's been to see my ma? I don't think anybody, Paulie. Chrissy says Tony sent her some chocolates. Chrissy said T made a killing in real estate, down Frelinghuysen. That assemblyman guy hyped him to it. Ralph told this funny fucking joke, though... at Albert's party. He goes: "Ginny Sack had a 95- pound mole... "surgically taken off her ass." - He said that? - Yeah. And you think it's funny? It's in bad taste? The fuck? That's not what I want. I want 50 T's, 50 reverse, got that? Guys. Pick up those ice- cream wrappers. If I were a carpenter and you were a douche bag What are you doing? Breaking my balls, what's it look like? I tell you, this no- show shit is tough. Deciding what not to wear to work, what not to put in my lunchbox.... You're breaking my heart. You should try sitting here 10:30 to 3:00. You got Carson Avenue? You know that girl the other night? Danielle? She's a piece of ass, but fucking rude. It's all here? You remember to put the spores in there? That's not funny. What the fuck's all that? Fiber- optic cable. High- speed Internet access. Lot of money in this shit. The kid was supposed to get a job this summer, an internship. Then it wasn't right for what she was studying. Okay. That's one down. Then she was gonna be a hostess at Artie Bucco's restaurant. I got her that. Then she couldn't work Tuesdays and Thursdays... 'cause of her baby- sitting commitment, and Artie didn't try to understand... so she left. Then the baby- sitting family disappeared to Nantucket. Then something else fell through, and then.... So, she's regressing. She keeps it up, she'll be back in the womb. Over the course of a child's life... there's a constant moving away and coming back. Security versus freedom. But what I find interesting, and that's if I hear you right... is that at the age of 19... she actually wants to stay close to home. See, that's what I was gonna say. - She did have someone close die. - Jackie. But she brings that up whenever you ask her to clean up after herself, or whatever. That she's traumatized. He was shot to death. It's tragic, that kid. It was some kind of drug deal, you said. Exactly, all the earmarks. It's gotta be tough. Then again, they'd been broken up, and he wasn't very nice to her. It may be a manipulation, in part. She's got a hard- on about Columbia. "It's so competitive." But it doesn't mean that her pain over Jackie's death isn't real. Has she said to you or Carmela she's depressed? Come on with that shit. She's gonna be all right. Maybe she should be on medication. And her anger is focused on Carmela, not on you? I catch some shit. But me and Mead' were always close. Even in that 15- year- old period, you know? When she could hardly stomach Carmela? You are the dad. The template for all future lovers. She loves me. I know that. Since she was a tiny baby. Might be helpful if she saw someone. Dr. Wendi Kobler. She's an adolescent psychologist and an educational consultant. What do you mean? Talk about private family stuff, like I do here, with you? Yes. Like you said, she's going back to school... she's gonna be with her college pals, back to the grindstone. That's all good shit. I thought you had final registration today. Technically, drop- and- add goes on for the next three weeks. Still, shouldn't you register for the classes you know you want... so you don't lose them? Look... - I decided to take a year off. - You what? And do what, loaf around the house? Actually, I'm going to Europe with Misty. What are you talking about? Look, Mom, I'm just not ready. If I go back now, I'll have to start meeting with advisors... who'll at least want me to temporarily declare a major... or independent course of study. I'll have that to deal with. And obviously you don't want me around here. That is not what I said at all. You think I don't want you here? She knows what I fucking make. Who am l? Bill Gates? I already support the kids. You're a bartender. You're supposed to be listening to my problems. Sorry I'm late. - What's up? - You tell me. Got a call from Jack Massarone. Massarone Construction? A very angry call. The M80 in the porta- pot. I told Benny-- Don't fuck with me on this. - The fiber- optic shit. - You knew it would be boosted? No. Yeah. I mean, Patsy mentioned something-- Jesus Christ, if I wanted Patsy in charge.... Use your fucking head, Christopher. I'm sorry, T, I thought I was. By drawing heat to a $250 million job? Think. The big fucking picture. Aren't they insured? She's nice, Janice, you know? - Not my usual type, but.... - Her hair, it's pretty. Pre- Raphaelite, they call it. With the curls. Nothing but net, motherfucker. She does have an earthy quality, you got to give her that. It's those big tits. No disrespect. And, of course, there's the issue of her family. Making her happy wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for my career. Game. Where you going? Come on. I'm tired. Come on. One more. Come on, a little fucking defense. Hook shot. Thank God. Where is the number of the therapist Melfi gave you? Why? What happened? She's going to Europe, your daughter. She's dropping out of school, going all over the place on a Eurail Pass. - What is she, fucking kidding? - Apparently not. Her passport from our Christmas in the Bahamas is still valid. - Where is she? - I don't know. Down the shore. I suppose all these parties she goes to... they're all memorials for Jackie Junior, right? Please, with the yelling. - You still on- line? - As a matter of fact, I am! What the fuck's in Europe? Experience. Real life. Art. I knew all this constant harping on art was gonna cause trouble. Gonna work in publicity or something. Some friend of Misty's is making a movie in Denmark. I think we should call that therapist. She's going back to school. They got counselors there. Better ones, Ivy League ones. No fucking way she's going to Europe. Fine. Maybe they don't have to talk. Maybe they're the kind of couple that doesn't have to talk constantly. One beer left? Danielle was over. We had pizza. I figured out what's wrong with that broad, and it's some bad shit. What's the matter, baby? Tony again? I owe this guy a lot, but he's a fucking jerk sometimes. Like he never heard of a learning curve. You know what? I'm gonna get high. I thought you were gonna stop using junk 'cause of your new job. I am. This is my goodbye party with heroin. You want to do a hit? I don't know. I did some blow at the club. It's funny with Tony. It's like Danielle was saying, how we send food to the poorer countries. No good deed goes unpunished. What is it with you and this girl? - What? I can't have friends? - You're amazing, you know that? With all your intelligence, you never see the big picture. - You met her where? - At the mall. So? Think, Adriana. Girl like that. Ass like that. She don't have a boyfriend, she don't like Paulie. - Like he's Jude Law. - Whatever. Are you that fucking blind? She's a dyke. You think? Use your head. It's a $250 million job. - My head? It was your idea. - Excuse me? When the kid there, Vito, told you how expensive the shit was... I don't know, you gave me a look. A look? So now you're a fucking mind reader? It won't happen again. Stop now, it'll be that much harder to get back on track. Your mother's right. Just out of curiosity, what are you planning on using for money? Cheap Tickets is running a sale. I can cash in the bonds Nana gave me, and most likely I'll be working. Some student film. It's not a student film. It's a feature on DVCAM. Alvar hangs out with Dogme. He got honorable mention... at the Winnipeg Film Festival last year, for his short. Forget money. What about security? You think traipsing around Europe's a smart move these days? Like Europe's any less safe than here? Look, you don't seem to get it. I keep having images of Jackie Aprile lying in a pool of his own blood... in some street somewhere. So what? French discos drive away all sad thoughts? What, Mom, you've never heard of the restorative nature of travel? Read Henry James. Why does every college have junior year abroad if there isn't a need for it? Then why don't you wait for junior year? It's eight months. 'Cause I need it now. You want to go to Europe? Go. Clear your head. Run with the bulls. Do whatever it is the hell they do over there. Thank you. I will. Don't you think she should talk to someone first? A counselor, maybe? Maybe the college of hard knocks is what she needs. Let's see how she likes it when a gypsy lifts her wallet. Or learn you can't work without a permit... which the French hang on to like their balls. Thank you for that united front. The more we object, the more she'll want to go. You know her. She's going. I don't understand you, with this flip- flop. She'll meet other boys. Maybe an Italian boy, an actual Italian one. Jackie'll stop playing a big part-- - You would want her married to a foreigner? - Married, no! Jesus! Although, look at Furio. What's so bad about him? You do what you want... but I am not gonna stand idle while she throws her education away. What are you gonna do? She's not gonna take this drastic step without talking to someone first. Come on. Dr. Melfi's person is an educational consultant. Maybe she can explain to her how dropping out now... is not going to look at all good to medical schools. We could use an ally here... some adult, besides us, to toe the line for accountability and responsibility. So maybe you go on an anti- depressant to tide you over. You're not paying for it. I don't know. Maybe. Anyway, it was supposed to be his funeral. Jack's? And they all stood around... drinking and blubbering... at these egregious, saccharine, fucking Italian ballads. It was revolting. After I left the restaurant, I actually vomited. - You were drinking. - Smoked a joint with my friends, too. That's okay. As long as you didn't deliberately purge. When I asked you earlier what Dad does for a living... you said: "Waste management, wink, wink." What does "wink, wink" mean? Okay. He's like.... You know? You mentioned Jack's father was in the mafia. I didn't realize your dad was, too. There's no such thing as the mafia. I said Jackie's dad was a loan shark. How did Dad react when he heard Jack had been killed? He was pretty upset. He used to tell Jackie all the time, "Don't get involved. Stay in school." "Get involved"? With what? Drugs. Right. The "X"? So, Dad was a positive force in Jack's life. Jackie. Yeah. You don't like talking much about Dad, do you? He doesn't bother me. I'm gonna ask you a question about Dad. This may be very painful for you. Did Dad ever molest you? - No. - I don't tell them what we discuss. I don't think so. - What about Mom? - God, no! Unless you consider obsessing about my fucking GPA an assault, which I do. She has to learn that education is a lifelong process. That's what I told them. A college degree is a nice thing, sure, but not at the sake of emotional well- being. That's exactly what I said. Perhaps they should examine their own needs to have you stay in school. Blow off their self- esteem issues. So, you book on Columbia, you can come back when you're ready. Or I could write you a letter to the University of Barcelona. It's a hot school. I'm on a consultancy there. - Busy out there? - Bachelor party. Some asshole just slipped on a lime wedge. I was talking to Patsy. Sounds like Chrissy's got a little Napoleon thing going on. Yeah? - Good. - Right. Of course. Nobody's denying his leadership abilities. So, what's the problem? It's just....I don't know. Patsy feels bad, maybe he was passed over. What the fuck do you care? Last year, you were pushing me to take him out. I'm just saying, with the change of rank and all... maybe he feels... marginalized. Marginalized? What the fuck does that even mean? I like your pants. Leather? Yeah. I got them at Bebe. Fucking packed tonight! Let's celebrate. No, thanks. I'm gonna stick with the champagne. It's primo shit, Danny. We got an awesome connection. It's okay. So, I was thinking, right? What we do is start our own group. I'll be the singer, and you two can back me up. - Please. - Right. What? It's so hard to rap? My bitch, my ho, my ho My bitch, my bitch, bitch - What? It's a joke? - Stop! - You don't wanna back me up? - Stop! God. - That's gorgeous. - Isn't it? - Christopher gave it to me. - You like it, baby? - What are you doing? - What? I'm gonna go. What? Hang out. What's the matter? I'll call you tomorrow. You piece of fucking shit! - What the fuck? - I saw what you did. What'd you think? You were gonna fuck the two of us? You and those fucking videos! She came onto me! She took my hand, she was rubbing it on herself. - Bullshit! - How about right before you came over? She was telling me where she buys her pants. Her fucking underwear and shit. Fucking Bebe's, like I give a fuck. - I thought you said she was gay. - Who knows what her problem is? Broad like her will fuck a snake. Use your head. What do I want with that skank, when I got you? You were saying she had a nice ass. I was trying to say something positive, 'cause she's your friend. Come here. What have I been telling you about this pucchiachia? She's trying to fuck us up, Adriana. And what we have is stronger than any of that shit. I'm sorry. Son of a fucking bitch. What happened to the Krazy Glue? Somebody left the top off. Dried out. - What'd you want? - Nothing, really. You should see the floor tiles, though... that got delivered to the job site. - Mexican travertine. - Johnny Sposato will take that shit. No more dipping at the job, according to fucking Alfalfa. But the order comes down from Tony. - Go ahead. - What? Knock off the tile? - Tony says no. - I got your back. Tony will be fine with it. The rotor on the washing machine broke. Carm said I could use yours. Clean out the filter this time. Disgusting. So, how's your love life? Why don't you mind your goddamn business? It feels like it is my business... considering I had to haul your last boyfriend out of your kitchen in a Hefty bag. You're a miserable fuck, you know that? - You're just like Ma. - Oh, yeah? Really. With your condescension and your sabotage. For your information, Ralph is a great guy. Trust me, I got more information than I need about him. It's always something. Are you threatened by the fact that he has a sense of style? - A sense of style? - Ralph Lauren, Collegiate? Let me ask you a question. Do I know this guy better than you? 'Cause I'm telling you he's no fucking good. My happiness really drives you crazy, doesn't it? This reorganization of the Bureau could be good for both of us. - Lilac Personal Shopping. - Five fucking messages, Danielle? Can't you take a hint? Stop fucking calling here. - Sweetie, don't be like that. - "Sweetie," bullshit. - You're lucky I don't rip your ass. - I thought we were friends. Did you take his hand off your leg? Did you? - I tried. - Bullshit! Don't ever fucking call me anymore. Four fucking months of work. Maybe if we let her cool off. She thinks I tried to seduce her fianc√©, Dwight. - Little shitbag that he is. - What now? Do we set someone else up? And waste another five months getting in close? Her guard will be up anyway. I think we should consider the undercover- op a dead issue. Let's just bring her in, straight up. Still, in all, good work, Ciccerone. Right. Thanks. You know what the problem is, right? She gave Moltisanti a hard- on. So, what do we do? Hire only schifosas? You know, I had a dream about her the other night. This boring cocksucker. Jehovah's Witnesses are more interesting. Jack! How's your balls? What are you doing here? I got a foursome with some city engineers. - You got a sec? - Sure. Artie Bucco, Jack Massarone. Sure, you been in my restaurant. - Problem with the stracciatelle, right? - Yeah. Come on. It's all right. Listen, I don't mean to be a pest, but some of your guys-- - I told you I'd take care of that. - This is not the fiber- optics. I'm talking about the floor tiles. - What floor tiles? - Last night, somebody hijacked a trailer. The truck crushed a shed on its way out, too. My mother's expecting us. Look what the cat dragged in. Fucking greedy cocksucker! You had to come back for more? Fucking floor tiles, now! - You little fucking prick! - Come on. - Relax, fellas! - Mind your own fucking business. What'd I say? I distinctly told you to lay off this fucking job! Talk to Silvio! He gave the order, you stupid fuck! What'd you call me? That's right. Little fucking tough guy? You bastard. You work for me, not fucking Silvio. I told you to knock it off. - I'm calling the police. - Don't think I forgot... about you going through my fianc√©e‚Äôs underwear drawer. - That wasn't me, you fucking jerk. - We'll see. Who the fuck are you? Ralph Bunche, over here? You motherfucker! Oh, my God. - Let me go! - Let's just get outta here. Get him to the fucking hospital. Make sure he keeps his mouth shut. Keep your fucking mouth shut! Keep your fucking mouth shut! Right, he's the one. I never said they shouldn't get engaged. Mom? Can I have a tuna san? - Hang up that phone, please. - Excuse me? Can I call you back? - Did you go to see Dr. Kobler? - Yeah. What did you talk about? She said I don't have to tell you or Dad. It's confidential. This is what we pay $200 for? It was your idea. I only saw her out of a gesture of goodwill. I don't know what you're so upset about. It's my right to go to Europe. That's what she said. I don't care what she said. She's totally irresponsible. What? The therapist told her it is her right to go to Europe. She actually thinks this is a good idea? She said it's no big deal. I can pick up my education wherever, whenever. Really? Wendi said she can get me into school in Barcelona if I decide to stay. - Who's Wendi? - Dr. Wendi Kobler. Barcelona. I could take Melfi's head and crush it like a fucking walnut. I feel battered. I've gotta get to the salon. Did you tell Wendi that you didn't work all summer? Wait, you're right. I forgot to mention the pivotal role of the work ethic in this family. - You can lose that smart mouth right now. - Or what? What is this, Afghanistan? I'm over 18 now, I'm a grown woman. I can go where I want and do what I want. All right, Jesus, God, we know that! Is that your only point here? Because just getting what you want is for babies, not adults. It may interest you to know she thinks I should probably be on Prozac. - She does? - She said that? Jackie was murdered. I know you think... it's nothing screaming my head off at the Columbia- Army game wouldn't cure. - That is so unfair. - All right, look. I've been thinking about this. Now, you're a smart girl. The right move for you is to wait. Just till next year, maybe. You know what I don't understand, Dad? - You were all in favor of me going. - Your mother doesn't want it. Wow. Listen to Mr. Mob Boss. What did you call me? All this fucking pussyfooting around. Years now? - Why don't we just get it all out there? - Shut up. You got something you wanna say to me? - What do you mean? - What do I mean? What do you mean? All these innuendoes. You inferring I didn't do everything I could... to keep that kid from fucking himself up? That, knowing him and his family... that I didn't try to be a better dad to him than his own dad? God rest his soul. That I didn't try to protect Jackie Junior? That I didn't smack him around, 'cause I was so frustrated? Is that what you're trying to tell me? I'm through telling people you help with environmental cleanup. That's not what I asked you. Like you could talk honestly for three fucking seconds. You try me! I've made my plans, I'm going to Europe, and I'm getting the fuck out of here! - You been told no! - Watch me! Don't do it! I'm warning you, do not do it! Do it for Mommy. That's a good girl. Special agent Dwight Harris, FBI. I believe you two have already met. Holy fucking shit! Don't make a scene. You don't want to attract attention. - You're in the fucking FBI? - We need to talk, Ade. It'll only take a half hour, and I assure you, it's in your best interest. Come with us, please. - My dog. - It's okay. Just take her with you. Am I under arrest? Not at this time, but that can all change momentarily. That's a search warrant. Your office, your club, your cocaine. - It's not my cocaine. - Really? - That's not what I have you saying on tape. - You were taping me? If I were you, I'd put aside my hurt feelings for a while. I told you shit in confidence that had nothing to do with any of this shit! Things that I never told no one. We're offering you a way out. A chance to save your life and Christopher's life. You don't give a fuck about us! You and your fucking ob- gyn doctor. You wanted me and Christopher... to stay together long enough so you could find shit out. We understand your fianc√© is moving up in the world... or down, as the case may be. Problems at the Esplanade construction site? Oh, my God. We're not asking you to wear a wire. We're not asking you to testify. We just want information. Is your name even Danielle? What if I say no?
