NOBODY EVER WENT BROKE UNDERESTIMATING THE TASTE OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS POSTULATED SEVEN SOULS. THE TOP SOUL AND THE FIRST TO LEAVE AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH IS REN: THE SECRET NAME. THIS CORRESPONDS TO MY DIRECTOR. HE DIRECTS THE FILM OF YOUR LIFE FROM CONCEPTION TO DEATH. "THE SECRET NAME" IS THE TITLE OF YOUR FILM. WHEN YOU DIE, THAT'S WHERE REN CAME IN. SECOND SOUL AND SECOND ONE IS SEKEM: ENERGY, POWER, LIGHT. THE DIRECTOR GIVES THE ORDERS, SEKEM PRESSES THE RIGHT BUTTONS. NUMBER THREE IS KHU: THE GUARDIAN ANGEL. HE, SHE OR IT IS THIRD MAN OUT. NUMBER FOUR IS BA: THE HEART-- OFTEN TREACHEROUS. NUMBER FIVE IS KA: THE DOUBLE. THE KA, WHICH USUALLY REACHES ADOLESCENCE AT THE TIME OF BODILY DEATH, IS THE ONLY RELIABLE GUIDE THROUGH THE LAND OF THE DEAD. WHO'S GONNA LIVE HERE? A FAMILY. I'LL HAVE IT FINISHED BY OCTOBER. - I'M WORRIED, ADE. - EVERYBODY'S WORRIED. NO. I AM WORRIED ALL THE TIME. NUMBER SIX IS KHAIBIT: THE SHADOW, MEMORY, YOUR WHOLE PAST CONDITIONING FROM THIS AND OTHER LIVES. NUMBER SEVEN IS SEKHU: THE REMAINS. I'M HALFWAY TO CHINA. THERE'S NOTHING HERE. 40,000 I HAD-- MY SHARE OF THE BOHACK'S HAUL FROM THE '70s. DID YOU WRAP IT RIGHT? IT GETS MOLDY-- IT COULD'VE DISINTEGRATED. - WRAP WHAT? - THE MONEY. HE KNOWS I NEED THAT MONEY FOR MY FUCKING RETRIAL! - WHO? - YOU KNOW WHO. NO, I DON'T KNOW WHO. THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU. - MALANGA. - WILL YOU STOP WITH THAT? PUSSY MALANGA'S DEAD SIX YEARS NOW.

YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT AGAIN. YOU HAVE SUCH A LOW OPINION OF PEOPLE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, A.J. I DON'T CARE HOW CLOSE YOU ARE, IN THE END, YOUR FRIENDS ARE GONNA LET YOU DOWN. FAMILY. THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES YOU CAN DEPEND ON. HE WAS VITAL, MY UNCLE, ALIVE. FOR ALL HIS FAULTS, HE WAS SHARP IN HIS DAY. BUT NOW... WE STOPPED AT A LIGHT YESTERDAY, AND I SEE THIS NANNY, BLACK GIRL, PUSHING A BABY CARRIAGE. COMING THE OTHER WAY, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE, WITH THIS OLD LADY IN A WHEELCHAIR STARING OFF INTO SPACE. - THE CIRCLE OF LIFE. - THE CIRCLE JERK OF LIFE. WHERE'S THE DIGNITY? IF YOU'RE LUCKY, IN THE END YOU CAN LET GO OF YOUR PRIDE, LET YOUR LOVED ONES CARE FOR YOU. I'D RATHER THEY HOLD A PILLOW OVER MY FACE. I FIND IT INTERESTING YOU WOULD SAY THAT. YOU TRIED TO SMOTHER YOUR MOTHER WITH A PILLOW. - WHAT? - IN THE HOSPITAL, AFTER HER STROKE. THE FUCK I DID! I GRABBED A PILLOW, BUT IT WAS... JUST TO KEEP MY HANDS OCCUPIED. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED GETTING YOUR UNCLE SOME LIVE-IN HELP? WE GOT A GIRL COMES IN DAYS, SHE'S FROM TRINIDAD. DOES HE HAVE THE MEANS FOR ASSISTED LIVING? DID YOU JUST SAY TO LET YOUR LOVED ONES TAKE CARE OF YOU? - IF IT'S FEASIBLE. - WELL, HE'S MY UNCLE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? THE FACT THAT YOU STILL, AFTER ALL THIS TIME, CANNOT ACCEPT YOU HAD A MOTHER WHO DIDN'T LOVE YOU. IN PITYING YOUR UNCLE, THE MAN SHE CONSPIRED WITH, YOU'RE TURNING THE BLAME FOR WHAT SHE DID BACK ON YOURSELF AGAIN, AFTER ALL THIS TIME. WHAT WAS YOUR MOTHER LIKE? DID SHE EVER LET YOU DOWN, HURT YOUR FEELINGS? OF COURSE SHE DID. SHE WAS CONTROLLING AND MANIPULATIVE AT TIMES. - SHE ALSO NEVER TRIED TO KILL ME. - I PUSHED HER OVER THE EDGE. BY PLACING HER IN A LOVELY RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. IT'S A NURSING HOME! IT'S LESS HURTFUL TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE RIGHT TO TRY AND DESTROY YOU THAN TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT SHE DIDN'T VALUE YOU. HESH IS A PERSONAL FRIEND OF MINE, AND THE KID IS HIS SON-IN-LAW. NOW I KNOW PHIL'S GOT A LOT ON HIS PLATE, BUT COME ON. I'LL TALK TO JOHN. I WAS TAKING MY SISTER THERE SATURDAY ANYWAY. HOW IS GINNY? CARMELA SAYS SHE'S GOT HER HANDS FULL. THE KID HAS THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD ON HER. RAY-BANS. CLASSIC, AFFORDABLE. I JUST PUT THOSE ON SPECIAL. YOU GOT SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE...CURRENT? - LIKE THOSE.

MAYBE I SHOULD SELL THE CAR, AT LEAST GET SOME LIQUIDITY OUT OF IT. THE MASERATI? CAN'T SAY I DISAGREE. THAT BREAKS MY FUCKING HEART. CHRISTOPHER MOLTISANTI CAME OVER TO THE HOUSE ASKING ABOUT IT. - HE'LL PAY CASH, HE SAID. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE, JOHN, PHIL RELATED. THE HAIRDO, HE'S IN A BEEF WITH THE JEW. WHAT? GOD DAMN IT, WHAT? THE JEW'S SON-IN-LAW. IT GOT PHYSICAL. YOUR FRIEND FROM JERSEY GOT INVOLVED, BUT HE CAN'T GET PHIL TO FOCUS. DO I NOT HAVE ENOUGH ON MY FUCKING MIND? THE GUY FROM JERSEY ASKED ME TO TELL YOU. WELL, THEN CALL PHIL AND HAVE HIM FUCKING HANDLE IT! DON'T YELL AT MY BROTHER, JOHN. HE'S TRYING TO DO RIGHT BY US. THE PICTURES FROM ALLEGRA'S SHOWER. NOON HE SAID, RIGHT? PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE BULLSHIT. I RECOGNIZE THAT IN PEOPLE EVERY TIME NOW. - THERE HE IS. HO, FINALLY. I WAS STARTING TO GROW MUSHROOMS OUT MY ASS. THERE'S AN IMAGE. SO GERRY FILLED ME IN ON THE WAY OVER. THIS WHOLE THING WAS A COMPLETE MISUNDERSTANDING. YEAH, THIS ELI KID, I HAD ANY IDEA HE WAS WITH YOU, - I WOULD HAVE NEVER... - HE DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT HESH? I ASKED WHO HE WAS. HE HIGH-HANDED ME. I THOUGHT HE WAS A CIVILIAN. - STILL, TO GET DRAGGED BY A CAR? FOR THE RECORD, THOUGH, THE CAR THING WAS A HIT AND RUN. SO WHAT DO WE DO HERE? - WHAT DID WE SAY? - 25 SOUNDS RIGHT. HE'S BLEEDING INTERNALLY. PAIN, SUFFERING-- SO YOU TELL ME. 50? YEAH, FAIR ENOUGH. COULD WE SEGUE NOW INTO SOMETHING MORE PRESSING? THE FLOOR IS YOURS, SENATOR. I SPOKE TO JOHN. THE SPLIT ON THE OFFICE PARK IS WAY OUT OF WHACK. SAME THING AS THE ESPLANADE. APPLES AND BOWLING BALLS, TONY. WITH FUEL COSTS NOW-- LIKE YOU'RE NOT PASSING THAT ON TO THE DRIVERS? 65/35. WHY YOU ALWAYS CAVE FOR THIS PRICK? I'M NOT CAVING. IT'S A STRATEGY. JOHNNY'S IN JAIL. YOU KEEP HIM HAPPY, HE'LL KEEP A LID ON PHIL. TONY B., PHIL'S KID BROTHER, THE BAD TASTE THAT LEFT WITH PHIL-- THERE ARE 200 SOLDIERS IN HIS FAMILY. I'M NOT SCARED OF THEM. - TONY LEFT? I STOPPED BY STEWART'S. I GOT A WHOLE LUNCH SET UP. DID TONY MENTION ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT? ABOUT YOU MOVING TO FLORIDA? DID HE SAY IF HE'S LEANING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER? LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED YOU TO DO. I GOT A CALL FROM FRITZIE UP IN BOSTON. THERE'S A GUY NAMED TEDDY SPIRODAKIS, OWES SOME MONEY. - YOU WANT ME TO COLLECT? - THAT SHIP SAILED. FINAL NOTICE TIME. REALLY? YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT? NO. I JUST GOTTA RUN IT BY VITO. HE'S MY CAPTAIN. BELIEVE ME, VITO WILL BE DOWN WITH IT. SO THIS COMES FROM TONY? IT'S COMING FROM ME. I'M NOT A FUCKING CAPTAIN? ALL RIGHT, OKAY? - HOW SOON? - ASAP. LIKE RIGHT AWAY. I'LL CALL WITH THE DETAILS. GET IT DONE. I'LL PUT IN A GOOD WORD TO T. ABOUT THE FLORIDA THING. THE REAR DECK, DIDN'T THEY SAY THAT WOULD BE REFINISHED? That's the old photo. It's been completely redone. THE WIRING IN THE POOL HOUSE? TELL THEM THEY CAN KNOCK TWO GRAND OFF THE PRICE OR THEY CAN SELL TO SOMEONE ELSE. Listen, you're responding to their counter. You should ask for whatever you want. OKAY, WE'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

PORSCHE CAYENNE, LIKE THE PEPPER. IT'S BEAUTIFUL, CARM. - Vito: <i>FIVE MINUTES</i> AT NO INCLINE. THEN I SWITCH TO FULL UPHILL FOR MY CARDIO. I WAS TELLING TONY HE SHOULD COME WITH ME. - DO HIM GOOD. - IT AIN'T JUST AESTHETICS, EITHER. GOD FORBID HE EVER HAS A HEART ATTACK. VITO, YOU'RE IN THE HANDICAPPED SPOT. - THAT FUCKING GUY IS HERE AGAIN? - THE MAN'S A FORMER JUDGE. - HEY, LISTEN TO THIS. "IF YOUR NOSE RUNS AND YOUR FEET SMELL-- YOU'RE BUILT UPSIDE DOWN." - FUNNY. HEY, BY THE WAY, YOUR FLORIDA THING... TONY ASKED ME TO SPEAK TO YOU...

HE'S OUT ON THE NEW BOAT. DOES HE THINK I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT SHIT UP HERE, WITH WHAT I'VE DONE, WHAT I JUST DID? IT'S NOT SO SILLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. I'M A TOP EARNER NOW. IT'S NOT OUT OF THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY THAT I COULD BE THE BOSS OF THIS FAMILY ONE DAY. I MEAN, GOD FORBID TONY EVER GETS... CANCER, CORONARY, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. Hey, big brother. Listen, I know I was supposed to sit with Uncle Jun' tonight, BUT TOM JUST CALLED FROM LOCATION. APPARENTLY, SOME SMOKE EFFECT WENT AWRY and he inhaled noxious chemicals. WELL, GO GO.

THERE'S NOTHING I CAN SAY. Colonel Dax, you're a disappointment to me. You have spoiled the keenness of your mind by wallowing in sentimentality. You really did want to save those men and you were not angling for Mireau's command. You're an idealist and I pity you as I would the village idiot. We're fighting a war, Dax, a war that we've got to win. Those men didn't fight, so they were shot. - <i>HELLO.</i> - WHO'S THAT? - IT'S ME. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - I LOST MY UPPERS. - PROBABLY UPSTAIRS. - GOD FUCK IT ALL! RELAX, WILL YA? WE'LL FIND THEM.
