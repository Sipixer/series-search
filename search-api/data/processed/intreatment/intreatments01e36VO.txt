named connell.</i> He's gonna be checking up on me. Can you imagine yourself back in an airplane flying a mission after what happened? It's what everybody wants, my father included. Well, you know, he and michaela, they're united in everything. You're putting me in a very difficult position, Alex. You don't expect me to lie, do you? Paul, look-- hey, cut the crap! I need this. Tell me, what would you do? I would stay in therapy. I would continue to deal with the difficult issues that we've been talking about, not sweep them under the carpet like you've been doing in your life. They will creep up on you again. But you won't tell me not to fly. - Hi. - You'll want to wait till the next hymn. The service has already started. - But they said 10:00. - For the Garrity funeral? - The prince funeral. - Oh, sorry. That's in the Gold chapel. Okay. Thank you. I'm Paul Weston. I was a friend of Alex's. - My condolences. - Thank you for coming. - I'm deeply sorry. - Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm deeply sorry. Shit. That's okay. Don't worry about it. It will dry off in a minute. Hi, I'm Paul. Roy. I was a friend of your dad's. He was really proud of you. He used to talk about you all the time. He would be mad to know I cussed just now. You know, today I think it would be okay to say any cuss word you wanted. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I'm saying them... In my head, without saying them out loud, 'cause of what I feel about what happened to your dad. Do you think swearing is better than crying? Um... I think crying's okay too. I don't want to. That would just make everyone more upset. You know, you don't have to be strong. My dad was always telling me I needed to be strong. oh. Whenever he'd go away, he'd say to me, "take care of mom. You're the man of the house." Yeah, I kinda know what he means.</i> But, you know, being the man of the house also means letting other people know how you feel inside. You know, whether you're angry or sad.</i> The chances are your mom feels the same. And maybe the two of you could help each other feel better. Your dad told me that you were an incredible chess player. Did you leave the king and the rook with your father onhe casket? There's this move called castling. Do you know it? Kind of, yes. It was my dad's favorite move. - Oh. - He swapped them sometimes. You sacrifice your rook to save your king. hmm. Roy. - Goodbye. - Okay. Yeah, goodbye. hi. Thanks for calling me. Sure. Well, I wanted to reach you before you read about it or saw it on the news. Are you okay? You look-- Have youlept? Uh, not really. Sometimes I think it's better not to, you know? I keep dreaming about this. mmm. I never had a patient die before in treatment. You'd think in 20 years but... It hasn't. Ned before, you should take some time off. Well, I'm definitely gonna take the morning off. I have to keep my afternoon appointments. No, you shouldn't do that, Paul. I know, but I've promised, so... Also, I-- I also don't just want to sit there and not give anything back. No, you need to cancel for your sake, Paul. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. - Was that his son? - He seems to be doing okay. I was, uh-- I was talking to him earlier on. What the hell do you say to a nine-year-old kid whose father is... Not coming home? It's hard to see so many people in pain, you know, and not be able to help them in some way. Well, maybe helping is easier than feeling the pain. - True... - Mmm. ...Dr. Laura. You know, my mother is buried in this cemetery. - Oh, I didn't know she-- - Mmm. - When did she die? - Oh, a long time ago. - 18 years. - Do you visit her often? Well, you see, we named our daughter after my mother-- Rosemary-- So it's my daughter's name on the gravestone in a way. I can't bear that, so no, I don't-- I don't visit often, no. Actually, I agonized whether or not I should come today. - Hmm? - I didn't want to be disrespectful. Why would you be disrespectful? Well, to her, his wife. I mean, she lost her husband, her children lost their father. That's something meaningful. I mean, what am I? A what, an ex-fling? I think it's really great that you came today. The truth is he was a nice guy. Yeah, he was funny and sweet and beautiful. I mean, if our timing had been different or if we hadn't met through you or if I had been an entirely different person, maybe... Well, big ifs. Big ifs. Mmm. Hmm. If. I'm sorry, did you get one of these? - No. - Directions to the gravesite. It's a huge cemetery, a bit of a labyrinth. Oh. Okay. Thank you. - Dr. Weston? - Yes. - I'm Daniel alterio. - Oh. I called you the other day with the news. It's nice to meet you. Thank you. I recognized your voice. I hope I wasn't too abrupt on the phone. I had a long list of people to call and I was still reeling myself. I understand. Maybe you're the person who can explain to me why almost every person that I gave the news to, their first response was "but I just saw him." Well, maybe this is just... Their mind's way of processing the shock. - I'm sorry. Daniel. - Laura. - Hello. - Hi. So had you just seen him? No. No, he was staying with me, but we'd both been so busy. I tried to get him to go to the opera with me the other night-- Sean offered Alex his ticket-- But our Alex wasn't the opera kind of guy. He was afraid of opera. - I'm afraid of flying. - Me too. - really? - Terrified. Thank God for drugs.</i> Amen. Alex was always trying to get me to fly with him. Promised if he took me up, I'd be safe. I'm sure that's true. Yeah. I just never thought it would end like this for him.</i> I mean, I knew the risks, but I just never thought he'd get into trouble up there. Then again, everything I ever thought of Alex</i> got turned on its head sooner or later. But look who I'm telling-- The authority.</i> It was good to meet you. - You too, Daniel. - Uh, I'm sorry. Laurie was it? - No, Laura. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - I'll see you both in about a half hour. - Okay. Thank you. Are you okay? Yeah. Are you? Yeah. And if you weren't, would you say anything to me? - I would. - Cool. Excuse me. Do I know you? Oh, I'm-- I'm Paul Weston. I was friend of Alex's. My deepest deepest condolences. Thank you. I don't remember-- You played racquetball with him. No no no no, that was a walton. Sorry, that was somebody-- walton. Alex, you know, he had so many friends I never met... Until now. It's a terrible thing, you know, having to pick out a plot for your child. Michaela, she, uh... She left it to me. Alex, he liked to lay in the sun. He would lay on the roof like a lizard. Any-- anyway, uh, I picked a spot that's really out in the open, you know, right-- You'll see it. U'll see it when you get there, okay? I didn't get a chance to say it to you before, sir, - but you have my deepest sympathy. - Thank yo thank you very much for coming, you and your husband. You're a very lucky man. You have a lovely wife. Actually, Laura and I... - No no no no. - I'm sorry, I... I'm just all out of sorts today. I understand. It's so quiet. When I was a little girl... I'd make my mother tie my shoes so tight that sometimes the laces would snap. And I liked the bed sheets pulled really taut so that it was hard to turn over. I liked the feeling of something holding me in. I think I was afraid that maybe I'd float away and no one would notice. Sorry about that before. I should've introduced you properly. Oh, it's okay. It kind of caught me on the hop. Paul, it's fine. When I was growing up, people always thought my stepmother was my-- Was my sister. She was... 26 years younger than my father. A few times, actually, she and I were mistaken for a couple. And the old man would play into it, as if she and I were a pair of newlyweds taking the old man out for a night on the town. God, he loved it so much, being with her, because she was so... You know, young and beautiful. So proud of the fact that... She was with him. How did they meet? He was a doctor and-- a heart surgeon. She was a patient and did a bypass on her. They started to date and then he left my mother. That was a nightmare. Hmm. When I was a teenager I was always-- Always in trouble. I remember once this counselor said to me, "what are you going to be when you grow up?" and I remember saying to him, "anything except my father." Myather was a really selfish man. Whatever he wanted, he just took it. No regard for anybody's... Feelings or... hmm. I, uh-- I think you should go without me. - What? - No, it's-- I don't know. I just don't feel up to it. Everything's caught up with me, and watching them put him in the ground is a little too much for me. You su? - Yeah, you go. Pay your respects. No one knows
