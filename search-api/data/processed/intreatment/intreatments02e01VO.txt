How dare you? It's completly over if that matters at all. Am I the first patient to be in love with you, Paul? You all right? - I don't think I can do this. - Do what? Just don't think it's leading anywhere. - Where do you want it to lead, Alex? - Some place sane, I miss flying. We need to discuss in a little greater detail - your ending therapy. - I'm finishing today. - Tell 'em I'm ready. - Let's just talk about - wether you're ready or not. - I need this. You're putting me in a very difficult position. Never had a patient died before in treatment. - You're going out? - I'm going to see Laura. - You ever been in a patient house? - You're not a patient. - Are you over me? - No, I'm not. I saw Laura today. I went to over there to tell her that I love her. - What happened? - I had anxiety attack. You had to take him apart, didn't you? Do you think that Alex's therapy here had something to do woth his death? Okay, all right, I'm coming, I'm coming. Who is it? Delivery. Mr. Prince. What, you thought if you moved to brooklyn I wouldn't find you? Well, is... is everything okay? Okay? What, did you forget already? No, of course I didn't. How could I ever forget that? No one wants to take responsibility. You know, everybody thinks they can just run away. - Well, not anymore. - I'm really confused. It's been over a year. - Has something happened? - I got the report back from the navy. There was no sign of a mechanical malfunction. I didn't know that. But you knew my son wasn't ready to fly. You knew. And you did nothing to stop him. Now he's gone. You still practicing? Would you like to come inside? Is this your new office where you help people, like you did alex? I would... I would never go in there. Mr. Prince, Alex's death was... a tragedy. I can't even begin to imagine what you've... I don't want you to imagine it, man. I want you live it. I understand your rage. You understand nothing. You want to understand something, doctor... maybe you will understand this. What's this? A lawsuit against you. I told them I'd serve the summons myself. Can we talk about this, please? Is that gonna bring him back? No, obviously it's not gonna bring him back. Well, you know, that's what killed Alex in the first place... Talking with you. I did not kill your son, Mr. Prince. Tell that to his son. I'm sorry. That's not good enough. You're gonna pay. I want you to pay. Mr. Weston, this way, please. Thank you. Paul. It's been a while. How are you? I'm... I'm fine. It's Mia, isn't it? I wasn't sure you would remember. Of course I remember. I'm sure I've changed. Well... actually, I had an appointment with a Mr. Ellis. I know. Unfortunately, he's stuck down in D.C. He sends his apologies. I'm covering. Well, then maybe I should wait for him to come back. Oh, you can, but he might be a while. And I've already looked at your file. But still, given our history... God, please, Paul. The first hearing is in eight weeks. I think it's in your best interest to get started. Eight weeks? - Is that enough time? - Well, exactly. Look, you're here. Let's just do the first consultation. I will ask some questions. You'll ask some questions. And that's it. Mr. Ellis can see you next time if you'd like. - Okay. - Great. Well, a beautiful view. Yeah, all the trappings. Right. Have a seat. I've handled a lot of malpractice cases. Malpractice? I can imagine how difficult this must be for you. No I'm fine, really. Malpractice? How do we... how do we begin? We'll start with some personal information, just to verify. Is that okay? Sure sure. You're 53? - You look great. - Thank you. Men are lucky like that. God, it's annoying. You have a B.A. And an M.S. From Columbia university and a phd from the New School. - That's impressive. - Thank you. And then, after your new york internship, you just picked up and moved. No, that was a few years later. I actually went to the Baltimore institute. Right, in the summer of '88, right before I started law school. And now you live and work in Brooklyn. - Welcome back. - Thank you. Well, I just actually got back last summer. I see. And you're recently divorced? Does it say that in my file? From your insurance company it's the first year you've circled the "d" on the form. Then I guess I am d-vorced. - And three children? - Yes. Are they with you? All right, so I assume you understand the basics of the lawsuit. You know, to be quite honest, I don't really understand any of it. Okay, let's start from the top. You're being sued by your ex-patient's estate. They claim that you should have understood that Mr. Prince wasn't ready to fly. And you should have alerted the navy to his condition. They're suing you for $20 million. Fucking hell. Only $3 million of which is covered by your insurer. Would you like some water? - Please. - Or maybe something stronger? What? It's a joke. It's just a bad joke. Sorry I'm not at my most jovial. Well, who would be? In my personal opinion, this lawsuit is without merit, but we live in a litigious society. So this... this first hearing - it could just get thrown out? - It could. And it should... but the threshold to allow a case to go to trial is subjective. There's the law, and then there's the judge you draw. But you've been through a divorce, so you must know that. Yeah, but the law is still the law, isn't it? Yes, but your patient was a young man, a father, a war hero. Yeah, well, to be absolutely honest, I don't think that he would see himself as a war hero. Either way, a home-town judge may want to give his family their day in court. But I thought... - you said it wouldn't go to trial. - It souldn't. But if it does, juries can let emotions get in the way of the facts, especially when it comes to suicide cases. What do you mean, suicide? Are you telling me that you think Alex killed himself? That's not what i'm saying. But his attorneys claim at he did, and they're out there right now, deposing everyone he knew. And they will find people who'll say that he seemed depressed and not himself. And the navy report... well, of course the navy are going to absolve themselves. Of course they are. That's not really a big surprise. Well, we will be making that point if it gets that far. By then it becomes a contest of experts. We'll find people to testify that you upheld the standard of care. Right, and they'll pay people to say I didn't. I just don't understand how this can be happening. The point is, these things do happen. And that's why firms like ours exist. Your insurance company chose this firm for a reason. - Did you follow the Bolinger case? - The surgeon who operatedon the wrong side of somebody's brain? I mean, that guy was completely incompetent. The facts were against us. But I was head counsel and we won. So what you're saying is that the insurance company chose you because they think I'm guilty and you get guilty people off. Is that it? No, that's not what i meant. My point is I've handled dozens of negligence cases, many of which seemed far worse than this one. I'm confident that we can help you. - I said no calls, Henry. - It's Mr. Nesky. Dad, i'm in the middle of a meeting. Are you okay? I'm so glad. And it fits? I know mom hates green, but I love you in it. Okay, I have to go. I love you. Bye. No more calls. - I'm sorry. - My father. It's okay. Since he sold the candy store, he has some free time. - A lot of free time. - He must be very proud of you. I've come a long way from the Pulaski bridge. Anyway, let's keep going. Your session notes you haven't sent those in yet. We're gonna need those right away. I don't have any notes. - Really? - I don't take notes. That could be a bit of a problem. What do you mean, a problem? Lots of therapists don't take notes. I mean, I start a session I'm in it. I know everything there is to be known about the patient. I don't nee dto write it down. Okay, well, maybe because of situations like this, you should. Process notes may not be therapeutically - important, but legally... - so what are you saying? A bad therapist who takes notes is better than a good one who doesn't take notes? Is that? I'm not saying that at all. Am I some kind of criminal because I never take notes? I wouldn't say "never", Paul. I'm pretty sure you took them with me. Can we take a break? I'll just be a minute. Dad, no, i'm good. Sorry. My father doesn't quite understand the concept of "she's in a meeting." Those aren't mine, the children, in case you were wondering. - They're beautiful kids. - My nieces. Never married. It's funny, a lot of women lawyers are like shrinks. They don't put out personal photos, but since they're not my kids, i figured... let's keep going. Where were we? I think that you were reminding me that I took notes when I was your therapist. You haven't been my therapist in 20 years. I shouldn't have brought it up. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. I was kind of uncomfortable anyway. Everyone who comes in here under these circumstances is. Let's get back to solving this. You didn't take notes. Did you consult with any colleagues about Mr. Prince's treatment? Well, yes, actually. I had weekly sessions last year with what we call... a supervisor. Great. What is his or her name? Gina Toll. Dr. Gina Toll. That's a relief. Is she in Maryland? Okay, great. We'll have to get a deposition from her. Is that absolutely necessary? We need to affirm that you did all you could for Mr. Prince. Well, I don't... i don't know if she'll do it. Why not? Well, because our relationship has been a little strained at times. Over this. Do you think she might believe - you're in some way culpable? - I, I... i honestly don't know what... what she might think. - Is that a yes? - I honestly don't know. Look, in the first place, Alex - wasn't in treatment that long. - Why not? He... the process of separation is quite... quite complex. Did you refer him to someone else? How did it end? I don't see what difference that makes. Oh, it can make a lot of difference. Why did the treatment ends so quickely? What do you mean by quickly? Before the patient was better. It was his choise to leave. Why? What happened in that last session? He said that... that he was... ready to fly and he told me not to screw up his life. And you let him go. Yes, I let him go. His attorneys are going to claim that he wasn't psychologically fit. Suicides often seem better before they kill themselves. Upbeat and determined, once they have a plan in place. Because sometimes, when people are actually doing better they seem upbeat and put plans into place. So which was it with Alex? I don't know I'm still trying to figure that out. Look, my patient died. I'm human. I have doubts. - Do you want to talk about them? - No Mia... I do not want to talk about them. This is... - it's kafkaesque... - Paul, we're in a battle here. It's not like therapy where you used to tell me to look for the grey. Not now. The law is win or lose, there's not subtext here. Actually I think there's quite a bit of subtext here. I don't follow you. You asked me if Alex's treatment was too quick, you asked me if I ended his therapy before he was better. That's just due diligence. But it could also be that the wires are getting a little bit crossed. It seems to me that you are expressing some of the feelings that maybe... - Bennett, I'm in a meeting. - Yes, I know. Apologies. I want to meet Dr Weston. - I'm Bennett Ryan, managing partner. - Pleased to meet you. I just wanted to apologize on behalf of Mr Ellis. But I want you to know I was thrilled when Miss Netsky grabbed the case. You're in good hands, but you know that. I understand you two go back a ways. Thank you, Bennett. And if there's anything you need, please, don't hesitate to call. Thank you. - Mia... - Yes. I have to rain-check our meeting, sorry. No problem. It's not what you think. - What do I think? - He shouldn't have walked in here like that. - It's fine. - Actually it wasn't fine. I'm the head litigator. He's the managing partner... There was a lot of subtext behind that performance. There was? It's OK, you don't have to worry about it. You know Mia... I think we should stop now. - When Mr Ellis comes back... - What are you saying? I just don't think that we should work together. That's funny... Haven't we been here before? How do you mean? I was 22... dealing with a crisis and you just disappeared. That's what you remember? No, that's what happened. You were there one week and gone the next. Obviously... I'm not a perfect therapist, but if you did feel abandoned, - I appologize. - Don't give me that "I'm sorry if you feel" bullshit. I felt abandoned because you abandoned me. I'm sure that we talked about that in our sessions. Did we? Then how come that last day I sat there on your couch, devastated. I was moving with my family to Maryland. I couldn't leave, you told me I had to. I gave you a gift that day, do you remember? - I'm not exactly... it's... - No, yeah. I never heard from you after I left. It's not usual for therapists to keep in touch with patients when they... Some do - if the patient means something. - Mia, of course you meant. You know what? Forget it. This is stupid. We can stop here, let's stop here. - It's my turn, I'm throwing you out. - Mia... Bennett said that... you grabbed my case when Ellis got detained. I'm just curious why you think you did that? I don't know. It doesn't matter. The last time I saw you you were just a kid. I remember you were worried that you wouldn't make it through your first semester of law school. But now... Look at you, Look at where you are. - Where am I? - You're the head litigator. A wall full of clippings. I think that... that you wanted me to see that, to see that you are now a success. I'm a success? Why? Because I work in a tall building? Or because I wear a Prada suit, or because I summer in the Hamptons and go to all the gala openings at the fucking Met? Yes, I made it through law school, all the way to the top floor, with the beautiful views and the windows that don't open and the fucking jackhammer that never stop. And you know what I do when I win a case? One of those hopeless ones, that only I would take? I go out and I get drunk with my gay secretary and then I stumble home to my one-bedroom condo, and I pray that I can fall asleep. Were you hoping to show me both how well you've done and... how sad you are? I see you sitting there and all I can think... I can stop thinking. It didn't have to be this way. How do you mean? Don't tell me you forgot that too. No. No, me neither. This was a mistake. I'll get your file to Mr Ellis, he'll do an excellent job. He's almost as good as I am. I'll make sure Ellis gives it top priority. Thank you. I really do have to kick you out, I have a meeting with another client.
