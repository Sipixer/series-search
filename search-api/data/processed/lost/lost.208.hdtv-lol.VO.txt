- Jack. We'll have the next drink on the plane, okay? - 42F. - 42F, right. All right, all of you, get up. Sawyer! Can you help memake a stretcher? We're gonna carry him. Walt! - Walt! - Shannon! Shannon! So how you doing? Well, the family with the screaming baby moved. You must be thrilled. Actually, it's... too quiet now. So how's Danny? You two trying to work things out? There's nothing to work out. He left. You okay with that? I guess you could say I'm one of those people who's just better off alone. So, uh, how was the firing range? Good. How did it feel to hold a gun again? Very good. All these steps count, Ana. You've come a long way since we met four months ago. She say, you know... when I can come back to work? She left the final determination up to me. Right. Do you think you're ready? What do you think? Welcome back to the force, officer Cortez. Sayid! Sayid, no! - Eko, let him go! - He's one of us! No! Eko! No! No! Eko! No! No! Hey! Hey! Don't move! Nobody move! Nobody move! Nobody! Does he have anything else on him? What? He just had a gun to your neck. Check to see if he has anything else on him. - Hey. Put it down. - Stop. What are you, crazy? Don't point that at me! - I said stop! - What is your problem, huh? Ana! Get back! Get back, both of you! - Are you crazy? - Ana-- - Now! - Ana! We need to tie him up. - I'm not tying him up. - He tried to kill you. No. You. You do it. Tie him. Use the vines from the stretcher. Hey, if we take that thing apart, we won't be able to-- Shut up. Ana, Sawyer needs a doctor, or he'll die. I know what I'm doing. I hope this is all of it. That's all we've got right now. Okay. Thanks, captain. Come on in. Hey. Look who's here. Good to see you, Ana-Lucia. Welcome back. Thanks, Raggs. I'll get you those I.R.S, captain. - Today. - You've got it. How are you? - Good. Fine. - Good. Your assignment. Evidence? You're putting me behind a desk? - Is that a problem? - I want patrol. - I don't care what you want. - Just put me in a car. You were in an officer-involved shooting. No. You doing this because you're my captain? Or because you're my mother? Both. I need to be back on the street. Please. I put you in a car, everyone's gonna know that I pulled strings. You don't want me to treat you like my daughter? Don't ask for favors. Then  transfer me. You don't get the transfer, but I'll give you the car. Happy? Sorry to bother you, captain. Ana, there's a call for you in the bullpen. They say it's real important. Thanks, Raggs. I'll be right there. They got you a cake. Try and act surprised. Jack, nice to see you out of the hatch. You can use more sunshine. I'll take that under advisement. A little fruit might do you good, too. Good for the constitution. At least that's what they say. Well, if that's what they say... Hmm? Where did you get these? Now just 'cause you're a little excited, no reason to talk with your mouth full. Past the hanging tree, double or nothing. You sure? Dude, double or nothing. There's no way you're hitting it that far. Hurley, the woman's on bloody steroids. Double's 10,000 bucks. Oh, that's nothing to someone who's worth $150 million. He'll  build you your own course if you'd like. - What's he talking about? - Ignore him. He's an idiot. - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Crap! You hooked it. Try keeping your left arm straight. You're giving me tips? Kate, I'm... I'm a doctor. So you think you could do better? Anyone can hit a ball. That's not golf. And what's golf? Golf is accuracy. Well, why don't we play a few holes and see which one of us is more accurate? Ooh! You're kidding, right? Three holes, no handicap. We play for bragging rights. What are we waiting for? Ana, let's just get to their camp. It was an accident. They'll understand. They'll understand? I killed one of them. - Those two move? Shout. - Wait. What are you do-- Untie me. - I'm not gonna-- - Untie me! Ana! What are you doing? I'm taking him back to his camp. Don't leave. Please. If that were you, he'd let you die. I'm not doing it for him. I'm doing it for me. So that shrink give you any good drugs? Not that kind of shrink. - Did you miss me? - Boy, did I. Heard about you and Danny. Want me to go kick his ass for you? Nah. It's better this way. What are we doing in Westwood? Thought a change of scenery would be nice. Nice, safe neighborhood for your first day back. - This was her idea, wasn't it? - She is the captain. 8-adam-9, please respond to a domestic disturbance call. 2210 south veteran. - This is 8-adam-16. - That's not our call. We're just three blocks away from that call on veteran. We got it. Copy that, 8-adam-16. Where are you going?! What are you doing?! Not the TV, Travis. The tv is mine! Like hell it is! I bought it with my money! Liar! - Did you call the cops?! - What?! Huh?! Do something useful, Shawna. Shut your trap! Arrest him! He is stealing my tv! - She hit me! She hit me! - He cannot get away with it! Hey, enough, both of you! What are you gonna do? Take the baby? - Shut the damn kid up! - No! Both of you! Put your hands where I can see 'em! Get down on the ground. Officer Cortez! Ma'am, get your baby upstairs. Ana-lucia! Get your hands on the ground! Ana-lucia! He's down. Okay, okay. I'm down, I'm down. Holster your weapon. Now. Hey... I think you should let him go. No. He's gonna come after me. You don't know that. I killed someone he loves. Sit down. Now. I'm bringing him water. You gonna shoot me? Shoot me. Don't even think of untying him. Who  is that woman? Her name is Ana-Lucia. She was on the plane. Tail section. They all were. We were bringing 'em back. Where is Walt? They took him. The others. What do you mean, they took him? From the raft. The night we left. Hey, man-- Shh. Hey, we're gonna get out of this, man. Guess you're first. Lucky me. You  know, the ladies' tee at my club back home is about 10 feet closer, so if you-- Shut up, Jack. Nice. You're up. Wow. You really put it in there. We have more balls. You could always just take a drop. I'm good. Got it. You may want to move. What? Where is the doctor? I got him. I got him. - Okay. Where are we headed? - Bathroom. He's burning up. We've got to get him in the shower and bring his fever down. What can I do? Okay. Go through the medical stash. There's a bottle of Ofloxacin. - Ofloxacin. - Ofloxacin, little white pills. Bring the alcohol and some gauze patches, and strip that bed, make sure it's got clean sheets on it. - Kate! - Uh, yeah. Yeah. What happened? John... the button. Hello. Hello. Hey. What are we doing here, Ana? I mean, their camp has gotta be close. I just want to get back to my wife. How long have I kept you alive out here, Bernard? That's right. So cut me some slack. Hey. We just want to know what you're doing. What's the plan? She has no plan! She only has her guilt... and a gun. You want a plan? Do you have any ammo back at your camp? - What? - Ammo for the gun. Do you have any back at your camp? Yeah, a couple boxes. All right. I want it. At least half. And I'll need a pack. A big one. A blanket. Some medicine. Clothes-- jeans and socks. - You getting all this? - Yeah, I got it. All right. You bring all of that stuff back to me, and I'll let your friend go. Unh-unh. I'm not leaving him. - Michael, you should. - No. We stay together. Go. I'll be back, man. Ana, what are you doing? You can't live out here alone. I'm already alone. I'll sign us out. What, you're talking to me now? I just want to go home, A.L. Hey, I ordered that guy to stop twice. So does that mean every time we run into some yo-yo with a tv in his hands, you're gonna draw down? Hey, Ana-Lucia, your guy-- we got him. His name is Jason McCormack. We picked him upon an assault on an elderly woman in Echo Park. His fingerprints match the partial from your crime scene. We questioned him, and he confessed. The D.A.'S ready to file charges. All he needs is for you to I.D. him. - It's not him. - He confessed. I don't know him. Can you guys give us a minute? Why are you doing this? Because it's not him. He put four bullets into you-- hollow points through your vest. He tried to kill you. You want a list of his priors? You want to put this guy back out on the street? It's not him. What happened? Out there. What happened? There was an accident. What kind of accident? A girl was shot... and killed. What did she look like? She was tall, with blond hair. - There was an Arab man-- - Shannon. You said there were five of you from the tail section? -  Four. - Four. Why didn't the rest of them come back with you? And Michael, Jin. They cannot come back right now. Can you take me to them? No. Here you go. What's happening? Why is he shaking? He's septic. The infection's gotten into the bloodstream. If the antibiotics don't bring the fever down, he'll go into shock. Hold him up. Okay, I got him. Swallow it. Swallow it. Swallow it. Damn it. - Here, I'll do it. - No, no, I got it. I  can do it. Sawyer... it's Kate. You need to listen to me, okay? The only way that you are gonna get better is if you take this pill. So I need you to swallow it, okay? Okay, here we go. Now swallow. Swallow. Good. Good. That's good. Nice job. Never learned the whole whisper-in-the-earthing in med school. What are you doing? I'm going, Ana. I don't want to be a part of this. I know everything you've done for us. And I wouldn't even be alive if it weren't for you. But I'm going. What about you? I just don't think you're the best judge of character. I was with you when you put Nathan in the pit. All right. You want to go? Go. Leave. You... go. Get outta here. Go. Michael! Hey. Hey, Sun. It's all right. Jin is okay. What happened? Where is he? He's fine, and I'll explain. But right now I need to find Jack. Where are they? I said... where are they? - Jack, it's not his fault-- - Shannon's dead! I'm not... You're gonna take me back out there right now. This man isn't the problem. He brought Sawyer back. Half-dead, with a bullet hole through his shoulder, John! Are you gonna talk to me, or are you just gonna sit there? Anything I say will only make you angry. So, yes, I will sit here. Jack! Jack! Jack! Michael. We got a problem, man. You remember how to get out there, right? Yeah, I think so. We should stop and think about this, Jack. Think about what, John? Shannon's dead. Sayid's being held at gunpoint. You want to sit here and hope that situation resolves itself? You be my guest. - Know how to use this? - Guess so. Stop! Please. What do you want? Excuse me? Peace? Revenge? Justice? And you are going out with all these guns. What do you want? I want all of our people back here safely. - Your friend murdered-- - Ana-Lucia made a mistake. What did you say? Ana-Lucia made a mistake. Ana-Lucia. I will take you there. But only you. And no guns. Let's go. Where you from? Where are you from? I am from Iraq. You have any kids? Why are you asking me if I have children? I'm curious. I do not. Do you have children? No. Are you going to kill me? That's what you're thinking about, isn't it? Should I? Almost 40 days ago, on this very island, I tied a man to a tree, and I tortured him. I tortured him, as I've tortured many men... men whose voices I still hear at night. Should you kill me? Maybe you should. Maybe you were meant to. I'm a cop. Well... I was a cop. One night, my partner and I responded to a burglary call. We were the first ones there. I covered the front, and he went around the back. I was there a minute. Then this kid comes right through the front door. I tell him to put his hands up. And he says I'm making a mistake, that he's a student. And he wants to show me his I.D. I believed him. I just... I let him reach. All I remember was a pop. By the time I hit the ground, I thought I was dead. I feel dead. What happened to him-- the man who shot you? Hey! Jason. I know you? I was pregnant. What happened to him? Nothing. They never found him. Go ahead. Pick it up. I deserve it. What good would it be to kill you... if we're both already dead? Hey. Hey. Can you hear me? You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be all right.
