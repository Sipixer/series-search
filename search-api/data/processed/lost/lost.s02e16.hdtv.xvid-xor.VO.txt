My name is henry gale. I'm from minnesota. You're making a serious mistake. For a long time, he will lie. He is one of them. She's okay. She's gonna be all right. - Where did you find her? - Just outside our garden. You were running like the devil's chasing you. Maybe he is. Good for you, keeping in shape. What do you want, Locke? What do I want? I've been here over a week. You've never said two words to me, and now you're sitting outside my tent? We got a man locked up down in the hatch. There's a possibility he's one of them-- the others. - Who's we? - Me and Jack. He's keeping watch right now. How long has he been down there? Three days. I'd like you to talk with him. You have experience with the others. You were a cop. Seems to me you're the most qualified to figure out if this man's telling the truth. Does jack know you're coming to me with this? We got a serious problem, Ana Lucia-- all of us. I'm taking the necessary steps to solve it. I don't need Jack's permission to talk with you, because right now, there's a man sitting in a room in my hatch, and I want him out. It's the thought that counts, and you just didn't think. I think all the time. Maybe you should think about giving me a little bit of a break here. Oh,  just hush, Bernard. Just hush. Honey? Are you all right? I'm... I think I'm just a little lightheaded. Well, you look as pale as a sheet. Well, give her some water. Yes, ma'am. Don't pay him any mind, honey. He's just mad at the world because he forgot my birthday. I didn't forget. I don't even know what day of the week it is, Rose. It's saturday, Bernard. Can you walk, honey? Really, I'm all right. Maybe we should go get jin. No! I think I was just out in the sun too long. Well, you spend a lot of time around the baby. Maybe you caught something. At least talk to Jack. Really, I'm okay. Thank you, both of you. In english? I'll... hmm. I would like an iced tea. Please. - Very good. - Thank you. Morning, Jack. You couldn't wait until I was done in here? The steam opens up my pores. Man's got no shaving cream, he's got to improvise. I also thought this might be a good time to talk about our problem. - Our problem. - Our Henry problem. We've had him locked up for three days now, and I can't help but get the sense that he's just not motivated to cooperate with us. And how are we gonna motivate him, John? I don't think there's anything we can do. I think we need to bring in some new blood. Obviously you have someone in mind. What do you think about Ana Lucia? Why her? She's the one you went to to start an army to fight these people. Why not her? Unless you're worried about what she'll do to him. I'll talk to her. I already did. She's in there with him now. Were you on the plane, too? I was in the tail section. We crashed on the other side of the island. You walked across? All the way here? That must have been fun. It had its moments. So are you gonna tell me your story, Henry? Why bother? I've already told it to everyone-- Jack, Locke, the big black guy that cut off his beard in front of me. Oh, yeah, and my buddy Sayid. You  can see how much he liked my story. So how about you try me? I don't mean to be ungrateful, but why are you gonna help me get out of here? On the other side of the island, there was this guy with us. I was 100% convinced that he wasn't on the plane. So I dug a hole, and I threw him in it. And what happened? I was wrong. And now he's dead. But good news for you, Henry-- I don't make the same mistake twice. So how about you tell me your story? Sawyer? Well, hey there, sunshine. What can I do for you? How's your book? Predictable. Not nearly enough sex. I heard that you have all the, uh, medical supplies. You heard correct. May I look through them? No, you may not. But if you'll tell me what you're lookin' for... Forget it. Okay, hold on. Now I'm intrigued. Tell you what-- tell me what you're lookin' for, and it's yours. Gratis. Can't I just look myself? It's not a drugstore, sweetheart. I need... a pregnancy test. I can't hear anything. She's only been in there about 30 minutes. How do you know he hasn't snapped her neck, John? How do you know she hasn't snapped his? So let me get this straight-- you and your wife travel around the world and crash here in  a smiley face balloon. Then she dies. You get captured by a french chick who brings you here, and then they lock you up. Sounds kind of silly when you say it like that. Why don't you have a beard? Because I shaved. Because I needed something normal. Okay. So why don't you draw me a map to your balloon? We'll go out there. We'll find it, and everybody will believe you. That's what they all keep asking me to do--draw a map. And if I mess up, they'll crucify me. You flew around the world in a balloon. And you don't think you can draw up a good map? Air travel... it's a different animal. It's about wind currents-- Do you or do you not know where it is? Yeah,  I know where it is. I went back there to bury my wife. Why did you do that? Because that balloon was the closest thing we had to home. You people have been looking for someone to punish for everything that's happened to you-- someone to blame. And now you've got him. Doesn't matter what I do. I'm dead already. You draw up that map, henry. I'll find your balloon. But if you don't... things are gonna play out just like you said. Hey, sun. Look what I found in the middle of the jungle. It's not even melted or nothing. Crazy, huh? You want to split it? No. No, thank you. I was just heading to the beach. Okay. Well, later, dude. I need out. He told me the same story he told you. You believe him? I don't know yet. I need more time with him. He's all yours. Tomorrow. I want to give him some time to think. That's okay with you? I didn't tell anyone, Ana. No worries, man. Bit large for a dining room table, isn't it? We cut them in two, it will suit the purpose. Sayid, can I talk to you? Of course. Alone. Whatever you need to say, you can say it here. It's about the hatch. Oh, you mean the guy locked in the closet there? What about him? It's to his balloon. How did you get him to do this? I asked nicely. Do Jack and Locke know about this? Jack and Locke are a little too busy worrying about Locke and Jack. All I want to know is if this guy's telling the truth. Why come to me? Judging from what you did to his face, that's what you want, too. This is at least a day's walk. Then we should get going. - You okay? - Fine. Thank you. That cliff there appears to be this. Score one for Henry. Pointing out a geographical touchstone does not mean he's leading us to a balloon. Maybe not, but at least we're on the right island. Humor's not his strong suit. And I'm saying this to you. You looking at my bum? No, I'm looking at your gun. My what? Maybe you should give the gun to somebody who knows how to use it. Maybe I will. As I recall, the last time you had a gun, you murdered someone. That's enough. We'll go as far as the base of the cliff, and we'll camp there. How long is it supposed to take? Uh, up to two minutes. - I'm sorry. I'm just-- - I know. Where did sawyer find one of these, anyway? I mean, who flies with a pregnancy test, right? Have you ever taken one? Yeah. Thank you for waiting with me... and not asking why you're here and not Jin. You're welcome. It's time. You're pregnant. Is it 100% sure? There's only one way to find out. These tests are pretty accurate. You know, false negative in the first week maybe, but a positive is a positive. - But it's impossible. - Oh, no. It's possible. You feeling queasy? Light-headed? Please, Jack. This is private. Nobody can know. You're not gonna tell Jin? In time, I will. It's just... it's complicated. As complicated as Jin being the last one on the island to find out you spoke english? Sun, my advice-- and it's just that, because I'm the last person to ask about this, but you should tell him. And when you do, you should tell him everything-- the whole truth. I'm gonna get back to the hatch. Congratulations, Sun. You've been down there a lot, Jack. Is everything okay? Sure. Yeah. Everything's fine. You okay? Sun? Sun? Sun? Sun, are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. You were distracted for our entire lesson. You're not fine. We... Jin and I went to see a doctor. He said I cannot have children. I'm... very sorry, Sun. I was glad. I'm not saying you should stay for jin. You mind? You should sleep while you can. Yeah... I can't sleep. People don't like me. I've tried to get them to most of my life. I guess I just gave up awhile back. I mean... I am what I am. But you... you've got a good reason to hate me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did. You were trying to protect your people. It wasn't you that killed Shannon. It was them. And once we find out he is one of them... then  something will have to be done. What? Nothing. It's gonna rain. We should get moving. Morning! Who wants breakfast? I have papayas and papayas. Let's go. Right. Why eat? This is it. His balloon would be rather large, right? Why am I not surprised? We need to look some more. This is where he said it would be. If I'm gonna back your play on this, Sayid, we need to be sure. I'll divide the area into three grids. We'll search as thoroughly as you please. Oh, for the love of god! Oh, no, no, no, no. It's not for fish. No, no, no. Oysters. Oyster. Pearl. For rose. - Ah! - Pearl. No oyster. No oyster here. Ah. Of course not. Why would there be? Yo, daddy-o! Sawyer. Way to go, papa-san. You didn't waste much time. I'd give you a cigar, Bernie, but I'm fresh out. Sun's pregnant? Keep it down there, Suzy. I don't think Jin Sr. here knows yet. "daddy-O." I... love... you. How is it? "Men reject their prophets and slay them. "But they love their martyrs and honor thosewhom they have slain." So what's the difference between a martyr and a prophet? Either way, sounds like you end up dead. That's the spirit. You in the mood for some breakfast? What's the computer for? Nothing. Cereal? Wow, where did you guys get cereal? It was down here all along. The pantry's full of food. How old is it? You guys don't know much, huh? I mean, I'd be asking all kinds of questions about all this stuff down here. You guys don't even seem that curious. Do you want the cereal or don't you? This must be my reward for good behavior, huh? I guess I earned myself some goodwill for finally drawing that map for Ana. What map? To my balloon. - Did you-- - No. Wow. You guys have some real trust issues, don't you? Guess it makes sense she didn't tell you. I mean, with the two of you fighting all the time... 'course if I was one of them-- these people that you seem to think are your enemies-- what would I do? Hmm. There'd be no balloon. So I'd draw a map to a real secluded place like a cave or some underbrush... good place for a trap. An ambush. And when your friends got there, a bunch of my people would be waiting for 'em. And then they'd use them to trade for me. I guess it's a good thing I'm not one of them, huh?
