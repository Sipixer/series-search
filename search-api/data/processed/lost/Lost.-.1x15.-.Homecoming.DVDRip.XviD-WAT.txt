There might have been a struggle. l think they've been taken. [groaning, grunting] [grunts] lf you do not stop following me, l will kill one of them. [grunts] - [man 1] Over here! - [man 2] Jack! [man 3] Where's Jack? - [man 3] We need the doctor. - [man 4] Right there. - [man 4] There. - [man 5] Find someone! [Charlie] What happened? Doctor! - Claire! - ls she alive? - What happened? - ls she all right? ls she okay? - [Jack] Where'd you find her? - A mile north, looking for the dog. - Conscious? - She collapsed in my arms. - Did she say anything? - ls she injured? [Walt] ls she all right? Everybody needs to back off, okay? Just give her some air. Claire. Can you hear me? Wake up now. Hey. Claire. Claire. Wake up now. - Hey. - [screaming] [Jack] lt's okay. Claire! Hey, it's okay. - lt's okay. - Claire. Okay. You're safe. Who are you? [Claire sobbing] Who are you? Who are you people? [insects chirping] [Claire] l don't understand. l don't know any Ethan. l... l don't remember. l don't remember any of you. l don't remember any of this. What do you remember? Um... l was on a plane... ...um, flying to LA from Sydney. Claire... We were all on that plane. lt crashed here, on this island. That was almost a month ago. No! l'm due... Your baby's fine. He's kicking. Everything's normal. Okay? Well, if it's been a month, then why hasn't somebody come to get us? [speaking in Korean] You think she escaped? You were right beside me, Boone. You know as much as l do. But where'd she come from? We were out pretty deep. Nothing's out there. She didn't say anything about Ethan? She doesn't even remember Ethan. The guy pretends to be one of us, he drags her into the jungle. She doesn't remember him? Apparently. You think he's around? l sure hope not. [Charlie] Claire. Here's your journal. lt might help. And this is where you sleep. lt's quite cozy, isn't it? When he, Ethan... ...when he took you away, he took me too. The others came after us. They got me back. But you... You were gone. Who is he? Ethan? Ethan... Ethan's the bad guy. So we were together when... Yeah. Well, why did he leave you? Why don't we leave that lovely story for the morning? You've had enough for one day. No, l won't be sleeping. Oh... lucky for me. Not much of a sleeper myself. Finally, l'll have someone to stay up with. We're... We're friends? Yeah. Yeah, we're friends. [sniffing] [man] How's that feel, mate? - Sodding fantastic. - Good, 'cause we're almost out. [Charlie] But we're not out yet? Carpe diem, my friend. Save your French for someone who appreciates it. Latin, Tommy. lt's Latin. Well, is it Latin for ''l've got a pile of money so we can score vast quantities of illicit substances''? - No. - l suppose you ought to clean up then. lt's time to put you to work. [rock music plays] [Tommy] Ms. Lucy Heatherton, 22 and ripe in oh, so many wonderful ways. Just graduated from Oxford, lives in Knightsbridge with dear old dad, Mr. Francis Price Heatherton, who, my friend, is bloody loaded. How you amass this information never ceases to amaze me. Ready to fall in love, Mr. Charlie Pace of the legendary rock band Drive Shaft? Absolutely. Oh! Seriously, ladies, l demand you stop buying me more drinks. l'm a man of high moral standing. Your obvious plan to take me home and ravage me will not work. Saucy sirens. l believe in monogamy. l will not be shared like a curry. - Are we that obvious? - Dreadfully. Call yourself ladies. Jane Austen would be ashamed. [Charlie] l personally feel misunderstood. l'm sensitive. The girl is pregnant. Very pregnant. Are we to believe that she escaped from him? - What're you getting at? - Ethan infiltrated us. Whoever he is and wherever he comes from, he's intelligent. - Who's to say he didn't send Claire? - You're off your head, mate. Charlie. Calm down. That's a stretch, Sayid. Tell me, doctor, how many times have you diagnosed amnesia? - And such a selective brand of it? - [Jack] Okay. lt's rare. She's been through a trauma. lt is possible that her memory reset to the crash. And the chances of that memory returning? - l don't know. - [Charlie] You know what? Talk about Claire all you want. l'm gonna spend time with her. l get the impression she might be a tad upset. [Charlie] Oi, Jin. You heading back to the caves? - [Charlie speaks Korean] - [Jin speaks Korean] Safety in numbers, right? Of course, you have no idea what l'm talking about. How nice it must be to not be involved in the bloody insanity that surrounds us at every turn. lt's quite beautiful really. You take care of your wife. Everything else is someone else's problem. No need to be involved in the decision-making process. No tree-shaking behemoths, French transmissions. Just sweet bloody ignorance. You don't know how lucky you are. Must be nice. You wake up and... [whooshing] [Charlie] What? [whooshing increases in speed] [grunts] [birds crying] Charlie, l want her back. - What? - l want you to bring her back. What did you do to her? What did you do? [choking] You bring her here. lf you don't, l'm going to kill one of them. Then if you don't bring her back before sundown tomorrow, l'll kill another. And another. And another. One every day. And, Charlie, l'll kill you last. [coughing] [grunting] What do we do? - We go out and we kill him. - Calm down. We don't want the others to get upset. - Forget them. He's out there now. - l think he's right. The man threatens to kill one of us, and what? We just wait for that to happen? We tracked him once before. We can track him again. You've forgotten how that turned out. He bested you. Physically. He hung you from a tree. Running into the jungle is not gonna get it done. - So, what does get it done? - We circle the wagons. Tell a select few, we post them as sentries here and at the caves. ''Tell a select few''? He does what he says he's gonna do, and that blood's on our hands. Okay, Jack, we tell everyone. But you wanna protect them, you need to think defense. We move everybody off the beach back up into the caves. What if Ethan isn't alone? What if he delivered his threat so that we would gather like sheep in a space where they could roll in and take us all in one fell swoop? Okay, John. l mean, obviously you have a plan, so let's hear it. [speaking in Korean] - [Claire] The others are avoiding me. - Sorry? No one will talk to me. You know, it just feels like something's going on. Anything coming back? After the crash, no. Some of this stuff is probably better forgotten. l don't know about you, but the rest of us been having a wonderful time. We even built a golf course. You sure there's nothing going on? Absolutely. Okay. [door opening] You're quite enamored of yourself. Now, Lucy, l know it's our first date, and you need to appear demure, but if you want to invite me for sex, don't say ''tea,'' say ''sex.'' - Do you want tea or not? - l'd love some. Brilliant. So where is the old man? [Lucy] l don't know. l think he's buying some paper company up in Slough. Oh, yeah? You two get on? [Lucy] Dad's quite cool, actually. He was proud when l told him l was going on a date with a bona fide rock star. lt was Winston Churchill's. Dad collects all sorts of rubbish from the great leaders of the Empire. - Hey, you should meet him. - Winston? No, thanks. - l heard he's quite moldy. - My father. He's coming back tomorrow. You should come around for dinner. l'd love to. Excellent. You look hungry. Thanks. Locke told us what happened. Why do you think he wants her back? l don't know. Maybe it's time you used that key you've been wearing around your neck. There are four 9 millimeters in the case... Uh-uh. No. l hand them out, someone hears something, gets scared... Chance of shooting each other is higher than shooting him. We're beyond knives. l'm not putting guns in untrained hands. Trip it. Not bad. Four around the perimeter will do the job. - l have fires at 20-meter intervals. - Excellent. Some have volunteered for sentry duty. l'll put them on shifts. l'll take a shift. Okay. Absolutely. We're counting on you. - Maybe we should move her. - She's safer here. What about the mountain? Another cave? - She's safer here. - Nobody's safe! Hey. lt's my fault he took her. l was responsible. l should've taken care of her. l should've... Nothing's gonna happen to her. Okay? Yeah. Okay. [Heatherton] l think my daughter would agree that you are the most impressive person who's ever had dinner with us. - My condolences, sir. - [giggles] l don't know if Lucy mentioned it, but l was in a band once, you know. Oh! They were called The Protestant Reformation. Yes. Ouch! Dreadful. You gave it up, then? Well, l was married, Lucy was on the way. Her mum, God rest her soul, wanted me to keep trying, but l always wanted to be more practical. Responsible, l guess. You know, a man has to provide, take care of his family. A man has to think about the future. And, of course, your band was bloody awful. Yes, there was that too. Small detail. So, are you working on a new album? We're in a bit of a hiatus right now. Liam, my brother, just had a daughter. So, you know, we're taking some time off. Quite a lot of time off. lt's been a year since we were together. l'm thinking of doing a solo project. Liam and l don't exactly keep in touch, and there's been some problems with... ...royalties. The fact of the matter is, sir, uh, l think that Drive Shaft might be dead. - [Tommy] You took a sodding what? - A job. A job? Doing what? - Selling copiers. - You took a job selling copiers? - l like her. - She's a moose. - Don't say that. - Are you off your bleeding chump, man! l've been getting you off on my scag for over a week now, on spec. - Spec means ''speculation.'' - Yes, l know what... ln this case, the speculation that you'll execute your end of the plan and steal something of value which l can in turn sell. By the time the bird realizes it's missing, it never even occurs to her that rock star Charlie bloody Pace could be responsible for such larceny, and the bloody party continues. Look, l... l don't think Liam's coming back. - l have to think about my future. - Future? - Yeah. - Really? - Yes. - When do you start this job? - Monday. - Well, today's Friday, isn't it? A full weekend without a fix. Monday should be bloody wonderful. Let's see how the future treats you then, eh, Charlie? [sighs] [crashing] [rustling] [grunts] - [man] Over here. - [barking] [Locke] The tree line. Something tripped the alarm. l think we found another missing castaway. [woman screaming] - [Locke] What happened? - [Sayid] ls he alive? - Oh, God. - How did he get past us? [Hurley] l thought those guys had the full-on perimeter set up. Locke said it didn't matter. He came in from the water. You sure it wasn't an accident? l mean, maybe the guy just drowned. [Kate] His neck was broken. Both arms. All bones in his fingers. [Hurley] Yeah. Okay. Got it. Guess old Steve drew the short straw. Dude, that was Scott. [Hurley] Scott Jackson worked for an lnternet company in Santa Cruz. He won a sales prize. Two-week Australian vacation, all expenses paid. He was a good guy. l'm sorry l kept calling you Steve, man. - Um... Amen, l guess. - Amen. l don't know how to end these. Hi. Um... Why is everyone staring at me? - l'm not staring at you. - What's your name? - Shannon. - Shannon, you're staring. - You mean nobody's told you? - Told me what? Why? Why did you lie to me? - Okay, look... - What else didn't you tell me? l thought there wasn't anything that you could do. Nothing l could do? Why would you keep me in the dark? l'm already in the dark. Sorry. l just wanted to take care of you. l can take care of myself. [Lucy] Look at you. Charlie Pace, respectable businessman. You didn't have to buy me this suit. Mm-hmm. What did you intend on wearing for your first day? l have shirts with buttons. - You okay? - Yeah, just nervous. Don't be. Dad's put the fix in. He's demanded they buy two copiers to boost your confidence. Ah! - You memorized the manual? - Backwards and forwards. Say something impressive. [clears throat] Uh... The Heatherton C81 5 Copy Center's leading scan offerings combine the benefits of document capture with instant delivery anywhere, anytime. - Anywhere? - Anytime, baby. You've been on stage in front of thousands of screaming fans. This is just some men who want to buy a silly copy machine. You're gonna do great. l believe in you. Oh! l almost forgot. Wait here. Okay. All right, l know you'll protest, but you simply can't be respected unless you have one of these. Oh, Lucy. You're welcome. Okay, well... l'm gonna be late. The bus... The bus? Are you daft? - l'm driving you. - Oh, no, l'd rather you didn't. No arguments. You have everything you need? - Yeah. - Then let's get you to work. John. Wanna take a walk? [Jack] What happens after the sun sets? Well, if we don't bring Claire to him? Rhetorical, Jack. Same thing happens tonight happened last night. - You think you can track him? - What, l'm sorry? We know where he attacked Jin and Charlie. You think you could pick up the trail? - Maybe, but l wouldn't. - Wouldn't? Jack, l'm not a cold man. l feel for the loss of one of our own. But nothing fundamental's changed. Whoever he is, wherever he comes from, we're on Ethan's turf. He has the advantage. To him we're nothing more than scared idiots with sharp sticks. What if l told you that l had a way to get the advantage back? Then l would ask, ''What way might that be?'' Why, doctor, you've been holding out on us. l'm guessing you know how to handle one of these. Are you insane? - lt's the best chance we have. - No bloody way. To capture Ethan, we have to ensnare him. The only way to do it - is by giving him what he wants. - You have no idea. This guy, he will kill all of you. - You can't protect yourself... - Charlie! l can talk for myself. Claire. They want to use you as bait. l don't remember Ethan. l don't remember what he did to me. But if l can help stop him from hurting anyone else, l have to do that. l'm coming with you. You said there were four guns. You ever fire a weapon, Charlie? All right, we should do this. [Jack] Let's figure out a game plan. All right, Sayid, soldier. Locke, you're the hunter. [Charlie] Allow me to demonstrate the awesome speed of the C81 5 using... ...one of your... ...technical manuals. [beeps] [beeping] Not a problem. There's probably... something in here. One second. One second. Bear with me. [sighs] [retching] Charlie's right. About what? We have four guns. We should have four men. [Sawyer] Help? <i>Moi?</i> You know how to handle a gun or not? l know at least one polar bear seems to think so. Where'd you get the hardware, hoss? [cocks gun] l wanna come. Sorry. We're out of guns. And no one goes out there unarmed. How much ammo you got? - Hundred rounds, give or take. - All nines, right? Nine millimeters? The guns? Yeah. Why? 'Cause if the lady wants to come... Lifted this off the marshal back in the old days. You remember him, don't you? Surly guy, kind of a square jaw? Carried a Sig nine? Yeah. l remember you shot him. And missed. Yeah, well... bygones. And, hell, five guns are better than four. You'll be surrounded at five points. Everyone will be in visual contact. Make sure you stay in the area l've shown you. And remember, the guns are a measure of the last resort. We want him alive. [thunder rumbling] [rustling] [screaming] [yelling] [straining, grunting] [Locke] Over here. Jack's got him. Hold your fire. Don't shoot! We want him alive. [Locke] Claire! - You all right? - Yeah. [Sawyer] Over here. - Hey! Hold your fire! - Easy! Winner by a knockout. Nice one, doc. Maybe somebody can tell me who or what this son of a bitch is. Uh-uh-uh, jungle boy, not even for one sec. [Jack] Charlie? Why did you do it, Charlie? 'Cause he deserved to die. He could've told us where he came from. What he wanted with Claire. Do you really think he would've told us anything? l wasn't gonna let that animal anywhere near her again. Ever. Lucy. l'm sorry. l've been having some problems. - lf l could just explain. - Leave, Charlie. Lucy. - l made a mistake. - You made a mistake? My father's sales manager comes to my house to return a cigarette case the EMTs pulled from your pocket at the bloody hospital, and it still smells of your sick. - l didn't mean... - Oh, you meant to. You meant to from the start. You're a liar. l believed you, and you lied! l thought you wanted to... You said... You selfish bastard! - lf l can just explain... - Just tell me one thing, and don't you dare lie to me. l get why you pretended to like me. l understand why you stole, because you're a junkie, but l don't understand why you took the job. Why did you take the job, Charlie? l guess l... ...wanted to be respectable. l wanted you to think that l could take care of you. You'll never take care of anyone. l remember peanut butter. Why do l remember peanut butter? lt was imaginary peanut butter, actually. l don't know what happened to me. l'm scared.
