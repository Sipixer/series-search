[grunting] [groaning] [panting] [woman screaming] [jet engine whirring] [people screaming indistinctly] [man] Help me! Somebody, help me out. Somebody, help me over here! [engine whirring continues] Somebody, help me out! Oh, my God! [man screaming indistinctly] Walt! Walt! - Stay away from the gas! Stay there! - [screaming] [man] Help! Help! Somebody, help me! [groaning] Oh, my leg! Hey, get over here. Give me a hand. You, come on! Come over here! Give me a hand! On the count of three. One, two, three! [woman] Help! Please, help me! Help me! Please, help me! Get him out of here. Get him away from the engine. Get him out of here. Help me! Please, help me. l'm having contractions! - How many months pregnant are you? - Only eight months. - How far apart are they coming? - l don't know, a few just happened! Hey! Get away from there! Listen to me! Look at me! You're gonna be okay. Do you understand me? But you have to sit absolutely still. Hey! You! Come here! l need you to get this woman away from these fumes. Take her there. Stay with her. lf her contractions occur closer than three minutes, call me! - You gotta be kidding me. - l'll be right back. Thank you. Hey! What's your name? Jack! Stop! Her head's not tilted back enough. You're blowing into her stomach. You sure? That's exactly what l was doing. l'm a lifeguard. l'm licensed. You need to think about giving that license back. Maybe we should do one of those hole things. Stick the pen in the throat? Yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen. Does anyone have any pens? Do you have a pen? - Does anybody have a pen? - Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! [gasping] Big deep breaths. Big breaths. [creaking] Move! Move! Move! Get her up! Get her out of there! [people screaming indistinctly] - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah. You? - Stay with her. - Dude, l'm not going anywhere. l didn't know which one would work best. They're all good. Thanks. [breathing heavily] [grunting] Excuse me. Did you ever use a needle? - What? - Did you ever patch a pair of jeans? l, uh... - l made the drapes in my apartment. - That's fantastic. Listen... Do you have a second? l could use a little help here. Help with what? With this. l'd do it myself, l'm a doctor, but l just can't reach it. - You want me to sew that? - Like the drapes. - l used a sewing machine. - No, you can do this, l'm telling you. lf you wouldn't mind. - Of course l will. - Thank you. lt's for your hand. Save me some... for the wound. Any color preference? [chuckling] No. Standard black. [groaning] [beeping] Come on. Hey, you! - What's your name? - Me? Charlie. Charlie, we need help with the fire. No one will see it if it isn't big. - Okay, l'm on it. What's your name? - Sayid. Sayid. l'm on it, Sayid. l might throw up on you. You're doing fine. You don't seem afraid at all. l don't understand that. Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When l was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 1 6-year-old kid. A girl. And at the end, after 1 3 hours, l was closing her up and l... l accidentally ripped her dural sack. lt's at the base of the spine where all the nerves come together. Membrane as thin as tissue, and... So it ripped open. Nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and l... The terror was just so... ...crazy, so real... ...and l knew l had to deal with it. So l just made a choice. l'd let the fear in. Let it take over. Let it do its thing. But only for five seconds, that's all l was gonna give it. So l started to count. One, two, three, four, five. And it was gone. l went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine. lf that had been me, l think l would've run for the door. No, l don't think that's true. You're not running now. You think they would have come by now. Hmm? - Who? - Anyone. As if l'm gonna start eating chocolate. - Shannon, we may be here for a while. - The plane had a black box, idiot. They know exactly where we are, they're coming. l'll eat on the rescue boat. l'll eat on the rescue boat. - Hungry? - Yeah. Thanks. Any more... you know, baby stuff? No... l'm okay. - Well, hang in there. - Yeah, you too. You sure you're warm enough? [man speaking Korean] Do you think he's gonna live? Do you know him? He was sitting next to me. We must've been at about 40,000 feet when it happened. We hit an air pocket and dropped... ...maybe 200 feet. The turbulence was... l blacked out. l didn't. l saw the whole thing. l knew that the tail was gone, but l... ...couldn't bring myself to look back. And then the front end of the plane broke off. Well, it's not here on the beach. Neither is the tail. We need to figure out which way we came in. - Why? - There's a chance we find the cockpit. lf it's intact, we might be able to find the transceiver. We could send out a signal, help the rescue party find us. How do you know all that? l took a couple of flying lessons. Wasn't for me. l saw some smoke... ...just through the valley. lf you're thinking about going for the cockpit, l'm going with you. l don't know your name. l'm Kate. Jack. [crashing, tumbling] What was that? [crashing continues] - That was weird, right? - ls that Vincent? lt's not Vincent. Did anybody see that? Yeah. - [loud knocking] - Boone! [whirring] [crashing continues] [whirring] Terrific. So, how's the drink? - lt's good. - That wasn't a very strong reaction. Well, it's not a very strong drink. Just don't tell anyone. This, of course, breaks some critical FAA regulations. Excuse me. - [woman] Sir, excuse me! - Guess he really had to go. [woman] Sir, excuse me! [rumbling] [bell rings] [woman] <i>The pilot has switched on</i> the ''fasten seatbelts'' sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. lt's normal. Oh, l know. l've just never been a very good flier. My husband keeps reminding me that planes want to be in the air. Well, he sounds like a very smart man. Be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom. Well, l'll keep you company until he does. Don't worry. lt's gonna be over... [people screaming] [man 1] lt didn't sound like an animal, not exactly. [woman 1] l keep thinking there was something familiar about it. - [woman 2] Where you from? - [woman 1] Bronx. - [Charlie] Monkeys. - [man 2] Monkey lsland. [man 3] Don't know if we're on an island... You ready? You showed me where the smoke was. l can get there myself. l'm coming. Well, you're gonna need better shoes. Whatever it was, it wasn't natural. - Does anyone have any sunblock? - Yeah, l do. So l was just looking inside the fuselage. lt's pretty grim in there. You think we should do something about the... ...B-O-D-Y-S? - What are you spelling, man, ''bodies''? - B-O-D-l-E-S. That sounds like a good idea. No, they'll deal with it when they get here. l'm gonna go out and look for the cockpit. See if we can find a transceiver to send a distress signal. Help the rescue team. See if we can find a transceiver to send a distress signal. Help the rescue team. You need to keep an eye on the wounded. lf the guy in the suit wakes up, keep him calm, but don't let him remove that shrapnel. Understand? Got it. What about the guy with the leg? The tourniquet...? l stopped the bleeding. l took it off last night. - He should be all right. - Yeah, cool. Good job. - l'll come with. l wanna help. - l don't need any more help. No, it's cool. l don't really feel like standing still, so... Excellent. Can l ask you something? Me? l'd be thrilled. l've been waiting. Have we ever met anywhere? No. That would be unlikely. - l look familiar though, right? - Yeah. - You can't quite place it? - No, l can't. - Yeah, l think l know. - You do? ~ <i>You all, everybody</i> You all, everybody - Never heard that song? - l've heard it. - l don't know what that... - That's us! Drive Shaft! The ring. Second tour of Finland. Never heard of Drive Shaft? - The band? - Yeah, the band. - You were in Drive Shaft? - l am in Drive Shaft. l play bass. - Serious? - Yeah. Charlie. Track three. l do backing vocals. - My friend Beth would freak. - Give me Beth's number, l'll call. - She live nearby? - You ever heard of Drive Shaft? ~ <i>You all, everybody</i> ~ <i>You all, every... body</i> We gotta keep moving. - They were good. - They are good. We're still together. We're in the middle of a comeback. [thunder] You guys, is this normal? This kind of day turning into night. The-end-of-the-world type weather. Guys? [people chattering indistinctly] [speaking Korean] l'm telling you, you don't wanna go in there! There's too many bodies! [crashing, rumbling] There it is again. Oh, my God. Well, let's do this. - Let's get this trans... - Transceiver. Transceiver thing and get out of here. [grunting] [straining] [creaking] [pounding] Come on! [Kate shrieks] - You okay? - Yeah, you? Yeah. l'm fine. Charlie's fine, by the way. l'm okay. - Hey, you don't have to come up here. - No, l'm good. - So, what does a transceiver look like? - Like a complicated walkie-talkie. - [gasping] - [Jack and Kate shriek] [man coughing] Hey, can you hear me? l need that water. Here. Here you go. [grunting, coughing] - How many survived? - At least 48. - Does anything feel broken? - No, no. Just my head's a little dizzy, that's all. lt's probably a concussion. - How long has it been? - Sixteen hours. Sixteen? - Has anybody come? - Not yet. Six hours in... ...our radio went out. No one could see us. We turned back to land in Fiji. By the time we hit turbulence... ...we were a thousand miles off course. They're looking for us in the wrong place. - We have a transceiver. - Good, good. We were hoping. You shouldn't move. No, no. l'm okay. Transceiver's right there. lt's right there. Where's Charlie? lt's not working. Charlie? - What were you doing in the bathroom? - What? [whirring] What the hell was that? Kate. [slamming, rumbling] - lt's right outside. - What? What's right out...? - [trees crunching] - [pounding] - [man screaming] - [shrieking] [whirring] What the hell just happened? [all panting] [crashing, pounding] Jack, come on! [Charlie] Just leave it! - Hey! - [whirring] Okay, run! - [pounding] - Jack! [pounding continues] [blasting] One. Two. Three. Four. Five. [eerie howling] - Kate! - [both shouting] - Where's Jack? Did you see him? - l don't know. He pulled me up. - Where is he? - l don't know! - How can you not know? - l fell down. He came back. - That thing was... - Did you see it? No. No. But it was right there. We were dead... l was. And then Jack came back and he pulled me up. l don't know where he is. - We have to go back for him. - Go back? There? There's a certain gargantuan quality about this thing. Then don't come. Kate. l heard you shout. l heard you shout ''Jack.'' l'm Charlie, by the way. What is that? - What is...? - lt's the pilot. Did you see it? No. lt was right behind me, but l dove into the bushes.
