The nurses told me that your hands were shaking. ln my professional opinion, by the time l was called in, the damage was irreversible. l need to... [clears throat] revise my statement. l didn't come into the OR until well into the procedure. - This is not... - lt was clear that my father severed the patient's hepatic artery, which, in my professional opinion, led to her death. [Kate] ''Dear Mr. Sawyer, you don't know who l am, but l know what you've done. You had sex with my mother, and then you stole my dad's money all away. l'm going to find you and give you this letter so you'll remember what you done to me.'' l looked at the envelope. You wrote this letter. Your name's not Sawyer, is it? lt was his name. He was a confidence man. Romanced my mama to get to the money. Wiped them out clean, left a mess behind. You were just a kid. - [woman] Wake up. - [man] Open this door! - He's here. - Open this door! - Come on. Got to get you up. - [knocking, shouting] He'll think you're still with your grandparents, okay? Get under the bed. Let's go. Okay. Listen to Mommy. This is important. Get under the bed. - Don't make a sound. Don't come out. - Open this door! No matter what happens, don't come out, okay? - Okay. - Oh, God. - l love you. - l love you too, Mommy. Let's go. Down you go. - All right. - Brooke, open this door! - [shouting] - [Brooke] Stop it! - [crashing] - Stop it! [sobbing] Go away! Stop it! What the hell is wrong with you? l'm calling the police! Get out of here! What are you doing? What are you doing with a gun? - [gunshot] - [loud thud] [footsteps] [door creaking] [gun cocking] [gunshot] [panting] [snorting, snarling] [Sawyer] Ah! [yelling] [whispering voices] [whispering voice] It'll come back around. Boar took your tarp? lt was dark, but, yeah, pretty sure it was a boar. l thought the boar had vacated. Well, genius, l think we got some bad info. What was it doing inside your tent? lt was staring at me. Then it came at me, so l hit it, and it ran off into the jungle. With your tarp. Perhaps he wanted to go camping. You enjoying yourself? Yes. Well... Laugh it up, Mohammed. But l come back and find my stuff's gone, l'm coming after you. Sayid. What did you hear? After you ran into the Frenchwoman, you heard something in the jungle. l was injured and l was exhausted. - My mind was playing tricks. - What did you hear? l thought l heard whispering. What was it saying? Why? Did you hear something? Forget it. l didn't hear anything. What are you so afraid of? You're the one trembling, sweetness. [woman giggling] [man] Okay, this is really awkward. But if l don't say something now, things are liable to get downright embarrassing. - Hibbs. - Hello, Sawyer. Ma'am, l must apologize. l figured my good friend Sawyer here would be alone. l just need a few minutes. - Listen, baby... - Baby, who is this? Listen. You go down to the bar. You get a drink. l don't want to leave you. As soon as l get rid of him, then l'll come get you and l'll explain everything. - But... - Listen. Just trust me on this. l will find you. l promise. l promise. l got to hand it to you, Sawbucks, how you find women that beautiful to work your grift. Now, if l'm not mistaken, l'm fairly certain l said l'd kill you if l ever saw you again. That's why l'm here. To make things right. Besides, we both know you ain't the killing type. Here. Figure that makes us even for the Tampa job. What could possibly make us even for the Tampa job? How about the known whereabouts of the man who ruined your life? l'm gonna make myself a drink. You want one? You remember old man Parks, right? Ran capper for us on that gig in Atlanta? Yeah, what about him? He's been working at an off-track parlor in Sydney. So last week, one of his regulars gets too sauced, runs his mouth off about his glory days as a grifter. That guy. Frank Duckett. Hard-luck case, gambling addict, alcoholic. Runs a shrimp truck. Back in the day, this guy Duckett was quite the hustler. He ran the romance angle. Hook the wife, take the husband for the money. Was pretty good at it too, from what l hear. Until sadly one of his marks, in despair, took a gun, shot up his wife and blew his own head off. All in front of their little boy. l paid Tony to pull his jacket. Turns out Frank Duckett used to be named Frank Sawyer, a name l believe you appropriated for yourself. This is him? That's him. Thanks for the loaner. Always a pleasure. ls anyone curious where they came from? They knew there was a marshal. They assumed he was traveling alone, protecting them from terrorists. Sounds like a good theory to me. - Did you get all the guns back? - All except one. Who? How about l give you three guesses? Sawyer. l can get it back. Really. How are you gonna do that? l speak his language. You've done this before, and if l remember it right, you made out with him, and he never even had what you said you could get. Well, l only made out with him because torturing him didn't work. Let him keep the gun. lt's not worth it. Worried he's gonna shoot me if l ask? l just don't want you to owe him anything. - [Claire] Hey. - Hi. How you feeling? Very pregnant. l, um, had some dreams last night. Actually, more like memories. You were in them. Sorry. Thought l'd see if you wanted to go for a walk. Sorry. l have to... ...do something. Sure. See you later, okay? [whispering voice] It'll come back around. [snorting, hoofbeats] Son of a bitch! A boar did all this? Last night, it wrecked my tent. This morning, when l went to get my tent back, it attacks me from behind, runs off into the jungle like a coward. A boar wouldn't just attack you for no reason. Thank you, boar expert. This one did. lt's harassing me. What are you doing? - Getting even. - Would you listen to yourself? lt's a boar. Just go tell Locke, and he'll kill it. - Nope. This is my fight. - Do you know about hunting boar? You are gonna get yourself lost or worse. - Since when do you care? - l don't. Good. Then if you'll excuse me, l've got some revenge to tend to. [ship horn blares] You must be Hibbs's mate. l did a few jobs with Hibbs back in the States. - Nice enough fella. - He's a son of a bitch. Right. lndeed he is. A few disclaimers. Australia doesn't allow its citizens to carry handguns. You get nicked with this... l'm not gonna rat you out. Secondly, you know, l've been doing this for a while, and a man who buys a compact .357 with hollow-point loads, he's not looking to scare or steal. He's looking to kill. When it comes down to it, if he finds he doesn't have what it takes to do the job... Your sales pitch needs some work. What l'm saying is, you look a man in the eye and point a gun at him, you find who you really are. And should you find you're not a killer, there's no refund. Won't be a problem. [Charlie] Hurley, l appreciate the help, but you don't have to. l killed Ethan. l can bury him. Yeah, until he rises from the dead. Dude, l know how this works. This is gonna end with you and me running through the jungle, screaming and crying. He catches me first because l'm heavy and l get cramps. Are you all right? Yo, Sayid. Can l ask you a question? Of course. Did you ever get that Gulf War Syndrome? - That was the other side. - Oh, right. Then what's the one when you're all shell-shocked? - Post-traumatic stress disorder. - Yeah. Did you ever have that? Why do you ask? - l'm worried about Charlie. - What's wrong with Charlie? l mean, he killed a guy. He shot him in the chest four times. Maybe you should talk to him? [Kate] lt's a footprint. Based on the weight and the distance between strides, l'd say you've been following Boone for an hour. - Look. - Could be Charlie, l suppose. l'm tickled you have an interest in my affairs. l really am. Don't take it personal when l tell you to... l want carte blanche. - What? - lt's simple. You can't track this boar without help. Over the last few hours you have managed to follow the tracks of humans, birds, a rock slide, yourself... Basically everything except boar. You have no idea what you're doing. - Carte blanche... - ''Blank check.'' - l know what it means. - Anytime l want something from you, medicine, soap, whatever, l get it, no questions asked. Take it or leave it. All right. You got a deal. - Where'd you get that? - The plane. Jack was looking for the liquor cart. lt's a good thing l found it instead, then. - Got any more of those? - l got a lot more of everything, but you ain't got carte blanche yet. ls that a no? All right, sassafras. But if you want a drink, you gotta play. - Play what? - l never. What? l never. Am l supposed to know what that means? Call it a way to get to know each other better. For example, - l know you've never been to college. - And how do you know that? lf you had, you'd have heard of ''l never.'' lt's simple. You say ''l never,'' and then you finish the sentence. lf it's something you did, you drink. lf it's something you never did, you don't drink. That makes absolutely no sense. Learn by example. l never kissed a man. Now you drink, 'cause you've kissed a man. Your turn. l never implied that l've been to college when l never have. l never been to Disneyland. Oh, that's just sad. l never wore pink. l knew it. [chuckles] - The '80s. - Mm-hmm. l never voted Democrat. l never voted. l've never been in love. - You've never been in love. - l ain't drinking, am l? l've never had a one-night stand. Bottoms up, sailor. - l gotta drink for each one. - Your turn. l never been married. lt didn't last very long. l've never blamed a boar for all my problems. l never cared about having carte blanche 'cause l just wanted to spend some time with the only other person on this island that just don't belong. l never carried a letter around for 20 years because l couldn't get over my baggage. l never killed a man. Well... ...it looks like we got something in common after all. [crashing] - [snorting] - <i>[whispering] It'll come back around.</i> [gunshot] Are you okay? You're shaking. l'm fine. l was just having a... l can't believe this. There are hoof marks everywhere. lt ate all our stuff? Nope. lt ate your stuff. Mine's fine. Oh, that hog is gonna suffer. - l swear to God... - [rustling] Morning. What happened to your campsite? [Kate] What are you doing all the way out here? - Looking for salvage from the crash. - Find anything useful? The occasional scrap of metal, a few bags of coffee. l picked up your path a mile back. l thought l'd say howdy. [sniffing] Oh, son of a... Oh! Peed on my shirt. Took my shirt out of the bag and peed on it. And you say this ain't personal. He thinks the boar we're after has a vendetta against him. - Uh-huh. - That's three times it's attacked me. Maybe it's got your scent. Doesn't like your cologne. - l don't wear cologne. - Yes, you do. Yeah, well... - The thing's got it in for me! - lt's a boar, Sawyer. My sister Jeannie died when l was a boy. She fell off the monkey bars and broke her neck. And my mother, well, my foster mother, she blamed herself, of course. Thought she wasn't watching close enough. So she stopped eating, stopped sleeping. The neighbors started talking, afraid she might do something to herself, l guess. Ooh, that's good. Anyway, about six months after Jeannie's funeral, this golden retriever comes up our driveway, walks right into our house, sits down on the floor and looks right at my mother there on the couch. And my mother looks back at the dog. After about a minute of this, them staring at each other like that, my mother... burst into tears. Beautiful dog, no tags, no collar. Healthy and sweet. The dog slept in Jeannie's old room on Jeannie's old bed and stayed with us until my mother passed five years later, then disappeared back to... ...wherever it was she came from in the first place. So you're saying the dog was your sister? Well, that would be silly. But my mother thought it was. Thought that Jeannie had come back to tell her the accident wasn't her fault, let her off the hook. Good to go. Only two choices<i>:</i> Shrimp in mild sauce, shrimp in hot sauce. Pal? l'll go with the hot. Hot it is. Ah, a fellow American, huh? Good for you. You missed the lunch rush. Whereabouts you from? Tennessee. Yeah, l love the South. Miss those Southern women. [chuckles] [Duckett] Been in Australia long? Not really. For what it's worth, we have a special at the truck here, half-price for all Americans. Name's Frank, by the way. James. Good to meet you, James. One shrimp in hot sauce... [engine revving] [TVplaying in background] - Again. - [man 1] Are you sure about that, mate? - Again. - [man 2] You tell him, cowboy. These bastards think Americans can't hold [Australian accent] their liquor. [man 2] Look, l... l hate to hold my hand out, but l seem to have misplaced my wallet. Set him up. [man 2] l drink to you. - What's your name, cowboy? - Sawyer. [man 2] To Sawyer. May he find whatever he's looking for at the bottom of a glass. So, Sawyer, what brings you to Sydney? Business. You know why they call Australia ''down under,'' don't you? Because it's as close as you can get to hell without being burned. How about you leave the bottle, Slim? So, what's your handle back in the States? l was a... ...chief of surgery. Was? Yeah, was. So we're in hell, huh? Don't let the air conditioning fool you, son. You are here too. And you are suffering. But don't beat yourself up about it. lt's fate. Some people are just supposed to suffer. That's why the Red Sox will never win the damn Series. l have a son. He's about your age. He's not like me. He does what's in his heart. He's a good man. Maybe a great one. And right now, he thinks that l hate him. He thinks l feel betrayed by him. But what l really feel is gratitude and pride because of what he did to me. What he did for me. lt took more courage than l have. Hmm. There's a pay phone over here. l could pick it up, and l could call my son. l could tell him about all of this. l could tell him that l love him. One simple phone call, and l could fix everything. Then why don't you? Because l am weak. This, uh... This business that you have, will it ease your suffering? - Yeah. - Then what are you doing here? - lt ain't that simple. - Of course it is. Unless you want to end up like me, of course it is. [Sayid] You're developing quite a talent. Yeah. l get it. You're here to check up on me. You killed a man. A man who killed one of us. Who kidnapped Claire. Who strung me up and left me for dead. He deserved to die. l'd do it again in a minute. Pardon me if l'm out of bad feeling. When l was in the army in Tikrit in lraq, the man who lived next door was a policeman. One day his car was rigged with a bomb. lt killed his wife and three young children instead. They caught the man who did it. l volunteered to be on the firing squad, and l did my duty without a single ounce of remorse. Then for no reason, l found myself waking up at night, replaying what l did in my head. You're the one who needs checking up on. What happened with Ethan will be with you for the rest of your life. Any suggestions? You're not alone. Don't pretend to be. [Sawyer] l take comfort knowing someday this is all gonna be a real nice shopping complex. Maybe even an auto mall. Where you going? Know what that is? A hole in the mud. - lt's a wallow. - What the hell's a wallow? Boar's wallow. lt's his den where he sleeps. Look at these tree rubbings from his tusks. - You mean he's around here? - Maybe. [squealing] Wait... Sawyer! - [Sawyer] Gotcha. [chuckles] - [squealing] - l thought it'd be bigger. - Funny. We know daddy's got to be around here. - Here, piggy, piggy, piggy! - Hey. Put it down! That's not funny! Here, piggy, piggy, piggy! Hey, what is the matter with you? - You'll hurt it! - Over here! - Not funny! - Here, piggy... Ow! You're sick. l didn't hurt it. Find your own way home. No problem! Sawyer. l got a letter for you. - ''Dear Mr. Sawyer...'' - Who? You used to go by the name of Sawyer. What the hell are you talking about? You didn't have to. Tell Hibbs l would have paid. How do you know Hibbs? You don't... You don't know what you're doing, do you? You borrowed money from Hibbs? l was gonna pay. lt'll come back around. [panting] Kate! [snarling] lt's just a boar. Let's get back to camp. [Walt] Go get it! Go, Vincent! Go get it! Go, boy. Here we go. [Charlie] Hey. Hey. Want to take that walk now? Sure. Stick 'em up. Trying to be funny? Yeah. l was fresh out of pies to throw at you. Here you go, sheriff. - l asked you for this two days ago. - And l told you to stick it. But l made a deal with your girlfriend. What did she give you? Kate. What did she give you? Nothing she wasn't willing to part with. That's why the Sox will never win the Series. - What's that? - Huh? What'd you just say? l said that's why the Red Sox will never win the Series. What's that supposed to mean? lt's just something my father used to say... ...so he could go through life knowing that people hated him. lnstead of taking responsibility for it, he just put it on fate. Said he was made that way. Your daddy, he a doctor too? Was. He's dead.
