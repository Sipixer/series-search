[people yelling] [Shannon screaming] Help me! [dog barking] [barking continues] [Michael] Walt, you gotta keep that dog quiet. l don't know what's wrong with him. Come on, Vincent. Cut that out! [Michael] Aw... [stammering] Hey. Sorry. Sorry. - [clattering] - [barking continues] [growling] [glass breaking] [indistinct shouting] [clattering continues] [barking continues] [woman] What's he barking at? [growling, clattering continue] - What is it? - Somebody's in there. - Everyone in there's dead. - Sawyer. Right behind you, jackass. [Kate] Jack. [clattering continues] [growling] l'm gonna shed some light on this thing. - [roaring] - Run! Get out of here! [people screaming] Oh, crud. Now what? - [roaring] - [screaming] Come on. - They've gone. - [speaking Korean] [Charlie] What the bloody hell was that? Boars. - [groaning] - Those boars were looking to feed. We have to get rid of the bodies. Bury them? There's a whole bunch in there. More than 20. Digging will be difficult without shovels. Not bury. We need to burn them. - They're people. - l know they're people, Kate. Burning the remains. They deserve better than that. Better than what? Being eaten by wild animals? That's what's gonna happen. Any bodies we bury are not gonna stay buried for long. Look, l know this seems harsh, but that fuselage in the sun... lt's not about what they deserve. They're gone, and... we're not. What you say may be true, but for us to decide how these people are laid to rest, it's not right. No regard for their wishes? Their religions? We don't have time to sort out everybody's god. Last l heard, we were positively made of time. l'm not happy about it. We crashed a thousand miles off course. They're looking in the wrong place. lt's been four days. No one's come. Tomorrow morning we need everyone to start gathering up wood, dried brush. We'll turn that fuselage into a furnace. Wait until the sun goes down tomorrow night before we set the fire. lf he's so eager to burn the bodies, why are we waiting till sundown? He's hoping someone will see it. Looks like l'm not the only one who didn't sleep last night. There are better things to do with my time than collect firewood. You don't agree with Jack. - What are you making? - Too soon to talk about. l'm not sure if it will even work. Trying to pick up the transmission? The one we heard on the transceiver. lf the French woman's transmissions have been playing on a loop for 1 6 years, there must be a power source on the island. A significant one. - And you can find it? - Hypothetically, yes. l'm making an antenna of sorts. With a few of these mounted at different points on the island, l may be able to triangulate the signal, - find out where it's coming from. - So, what can l do to help? lt appears you're as anxious to get off this island as l am. [Walt] Catch the ball. Catch the ball, Vincent. Good boy. Good job, Vincent. Hey, hey, where you going, man? Nowhere. l just thought l'd see what Mr. Locke was doing. Hey, why don't you help your dad with the wood? l'm sure Mr. Locke doesn't want a kid hanging around him all day. At least he talks to me. Come on, Vincent. - What's your problem? Hand 'em over! - How about no? [Hurley] There's other people here. lf one of us wouldn't eat more than his fair share! - That's bull! - Knock it off. You're not happy unless you're screwing... - l'm peachy. - Knock it off! - Stay out of this, metro! - Hey! - What's going on? - Jethro's hoarding the peanuts. My own stash. l found it in there. - What about the rest of the food? - There is no rest of the food, dude. - We kinda... ate it all. - What? [woman] Nothing's left? What are you talking about? [people murmuring] - Okay, everybody, just calm down. - We can find food. There are plenty of things we can use for sustenance. And exactly how are we gonna find this sustenance? We hunt. How'd you get that knife on the plane? Checked it. You either have very good aim, or very bad aim, Mr... Locke. His name is Locke. Mr. Locke, what is it that we're hunting? We know there are wild boar on the island. Razorbacks, by the look of them. The ones that came into the camp were piglets. A hundred, 1 50 pounds each. Which means that there's a mother nearby. A 250-pound rat with scimitar-like tusks and a surly disposition who'd love nothing more than to eviscerate anything near. A boar's mode of attack is to circle and charge from behind, so it will take three to distract her long enough for me to flank a piglet, pin it and slit its throat. And you gave him his knife back? Well, if you've got a better idea... Better than three of you wandering into the forest to bag a hunk o' ham with nothing but a little bitty hunting knife? Hell, no. lt's the best idea l ever heard. - Who is this guy? - <i>[telephone rings]</i> - Yes? - <i>[man] Colonel, is this line secure?</i> - Line secure. GL-1 2, go ahead. - <i>Target area is acquired.</i> Maneuvers are a go for 1 300 hours. Repeat: We are a go. Roger that. We'll convene at the usual rendezvous point at 1 300 hours. Locke! l told you l need those TPS reports done by noon today. - Not 1 2<i>:</i>30, not 1 2<i>:</i>1 5. Noon. - l heard you the first time, Randy. And no personal calls during office hours, colonel. So... ...hunting boar now, huh? Who says this is my first time boar hunting? Uh-huh. Tell me, how come anytime there's a hike into the heart of darkness, you sign up? You know what's in there. Actually, l don't. And neither do you. What's your feel on our new friend? He seems to know what he's doing. Call me paranoid, but anyone who packs a suitcase full of knives... lf l didn't know any better, l'd say you're worried about me. lf l didn't know better, l'd say you have a problem staying in one place. You wanna tell me why you're really going? Sayid gave me this so he can triangulate the distress signal we heard. - Find the source. - This isn't about boars? l'm a vegetarian. - But why can't l come? - 'Cause l said so. Hi. Hi. Excuse me. Um... Um... Look, l am going off, away to, uh, hunt, and l was wondering if you... if you could keep an eye on my boy, Walt. And l'm Michael. Anyway, could you watch him for me until l come back? [speaks Korean] Sorry, l don't understand, but you're cool with this, right? - l don't need a baby-sitter. - Come on, man. Vincent needs you here. This will give me a chance to get to know your friend Mr. Locke. Yeah. Whatever. Excuse me. Doctor? lt's Jack. - Claire, right? - Yeah. - How's the...? - Oh, he's good. Yeah. Thanks. l thought maybe you should see this. Someone found it in there. They're collecting all the belongings. They're wedding plans for Steve and Kristen. They were on the plane sitting a couple of rows behind me. l remember because they looked so happy. l don't understand what l'm supposed to do with this. Oh, well, some of us were wondering if maybe we should do some kind of memorial service or something. You could lead it. Uh... - No, l don't think... - Well, you know, just a few words, or even we could just read off names from passports and driver's... - Look, it's not my thing. - Oh, okay. - Maybe l'll do it. - Yeah. Sounds fine. Whatever everybody wants. That woman is still sitting there. - Her husband was on the plane. - Great. - Are you listening to me? - What's a four-letter word for ''l don't care''? - l think somebody should talk to her. - l nominate you, Captain America. You just can't help yourself, can you? You don't have to worry about starving with me taking care of you. - l'm not gonna starve. - Right. What are you gonna eat? Ocean's full of fish. Hate to break it to you. The ocean is not gonna take your gold card. You really don't think l can catch a fish? You find something? The ground here has been rooted up. That's how boars get the majority of their food. They dig. Afterwards, they generally wallow in the dirt and rub up against the trees, scoring it with their tusks. Okay. So, what's all that mean? lt means we're close. - Hi. - Hi. - Shannon, right? - Yeah. Are you doing anything? Me? No, l was just... What are you doing? Um... l was just gonna go for a walk. You want to come? Yeah. Yes. Sure. Can l ask you something? l wondered when this was gonna come up. - Yes, l am the bass guitarist in... - Do you know anything about fishing? What? Fishing? My granddad used to take me out. Taught me everything he knows. Everything he knew. He's dead now, God rest his soul. Yeah, l'm like a... l'm a fishing fiend. You know, l mean, England's an island, so l just throw it in and fish. Good. Hey, doc, you got a second? What's up? That woman's been sitting over there by herself. Maybe she's having trouble dealing with her husband. l don't think she's had anything to eat or drink. Think maybe you could go talk to her? Why me? l'm not a psychiatrist. Maybe you should... Just thought you might want to do it. You're the one that saved her life. Hi. Rose, right? You remember me? Seat 23A. l was... ...the guy that told you not to worry about the turbulence. Everybody's getting pretty worried about you, Rose. You want to be alone, fine, but take care of yourself. You should really drink. Okay. We don't have to talk. Let's just sit... for a while. How's your son? How's he handling all this? A hell of a lot better than l am. You must be proud. He's a brave kid. Yeah. l can't take credit for that. l wasn't part of his life till his mother passed away two weeks ago. - l'm sorry. l didn't know. - That's okay. They were living in Sydney the past couple of years. - l flew out last week to go get him. - [growling] - What were you doing? - [growling] Shh. [rustling] Hey, quit giving us the steal signal. [growling and squealing] Ah! Oh! [groaning] Oh, God. Michael. [Michael] Oh, God! Ah! [Kate] lt's bad. [man] Move. You've got to move, colonel. Your troops are across enemy lines. Patience, a quality which you lack, GL-1 2, is the hallmark of a leader. Hallmark, huh? Tell me more about being a leader, Locke. And while you're at it, tell me about this colonel thing. l perused your file in Human Resources. You've never been in any of the armed forces. l'm just playing a game, Randy. lt's my lunch hour. l can play a game. Yeah. Tell me, what's a walkabout? ''Experience the dream journeys of the fabled Australian outback.'' You have no right taking that off my desk. So you wander around hunting and gathering food, right? - On foot? - Not that you would understand, but a walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal where one derives strength from the earth and becomes inseparable from it. l have vacation days. l'm going, Randy. l already made a reservation. Wow, John, you're really doing it, huh? You tell Helen yet? Helen? What's this, Locke? - You've got a woman in your life. - None of your business. What is it with you, Locke? Why do you torture yourself? l mean, imagining you're some hunter? And walkabouts? Wake up. You can't do any of that. Norman Croucher. - What? Norman what? - Norman Croucher. Norman Croucher. Double amputee, no legs. He climbed to the top of Mount Everest. Why? lt was his destiny. That's what you think you got, old man? Destiny? Just... - ...don't tell me what l can't do. - <i>[Kate] John.</i> He's hurt. - John? Can you hear me? - [Michael groaning] Locke! John, you okay? [Michael groaning] [Kate] Locke? l'm fine. l'm fine, Helen. l just got the wind knocked out of me is all. - Helen? - God! - What? - You called me Helen. Did l? - Which way'd that boar go? - Michael's hurt. - We have to get him back to camp. - Yeah, you take him back to camp. l'm gonna get that boar. What are you talking about? l'm fine. l can do this. John, you can't. Don't tell me what l can't do. - Get it? - Dude, quit asking me that. Sorry. lt's just you said you knew how to fish. Yeah, off the Santa Monica Pier with my old man and a fishing pole and bait. Never had to try to poke one with a sharp stick. Well... really appreciate you helping me out. Thanks. Hey... ...anything that keeps me away from that fuselage. And that freakin' redneck jerk! Damn it! Crap! Crap! Son of a... You want me to have a go? - Knock yourself out. - All right. Okay, here comes one. Put your weight into it. Easy. Wait for it. Wait. Now! Dude, you got to try to pin it. Did you see how close l was? You said not to corner it. Dude. Yeah. Excuse me. - Your name's Sayid, right? - Yes. l found this. lt's got your name on it. l thought l'd lost this. - Thank you. - Sure. His fingers swell. Sorry? Bernard. My husband. His hands swell up whenever we fly. The altitude. He started having me hold on to his wedding ring whenever we took a plane trip. l always wore it around my neck for safekeeping, just until we landed. You know, doctor, you don't have to keep your promise. - Promise? - The one you made me on the plane, to keep me company until my husband got back from the restroom? l'm letting you off the hook. Well, you're not gonna get rid of me that easily. Rose, you shouldn't be out here alone. You're suffering from post-traumatic shock. Aren't we all? Yeah, l guess we are. You have a nice way about you. A good soul. Patient, caring. l suppose that's why you became a doctor. Thanks, but... ...l was just kinda born into it. Family business. [Locke] l have never felt so alive. Getting to finally tell Randy off was... ...life-changing. l mean it. Now l'm free to do all those things l ever wanted to do, things that l know l was destined to do, like we talked about, Helen. [woman] It's wonderful, John. I'm happy for you. Really. l haven't even told you the best part. Do you remember the... ...authentic aboriginal walkabout? Sure. That's all you've talked about for weeks. Yeah, well, l'm gonna do it. l'm flying to Australia at the end of the week. And l've... l bought two tickets. - Helen? - <i>John, we've talked about this.</i> - <i>I like you.</i> - Yeah. l know. I've enjoyed talking these past months. - Eight months. - <i>I'm not allowed to meet customers.</i> A customer? ls...? ls that what l am to you? This isn't really normal. I mean, it isn't what I do. Maybe you should find a, I don't know, therapist. - l have a therapist. - <i>John...</i> l thought you understood. You know me better than anyone. If we talk longer, I'm gonna charge you for another hour. That's another $89.95. l don't care about the money! l just... I'm sorry, John. I got to go. Helen, Helen. Helen! Helen! - Hey. Hey, wait a minute. - What? Just rest here for a minute. l thought the guy with the gimpy leg should be deciding when we rest. Hey, what are you doing? Trying to boost the transceiver signal. l'm gonna climb this tree... ...and attach an antenna. - You're gonna climb that? - Yeah. Don't worry. Climbed a lot worse. [loud crashing] [crashing] [loud crashing continues] Locke. [snorting] [grunting and rustling] [squealing] [growling and crashing] - Hey. - Hey. These were... l found these the other day when l was... - Hell, just take it. - Thank you. What is that? Oh, l get it. lt's like toothpaste. - [speaks Korean] - [imitates Korean word] Dad! - So, like, what happened out there? - Dad! Hey! - Your leg's messed up. Does it hurt? - lt's okay. Not as bad as it looks. The mighty huntress returns. - What's for dinner, honey? - Not now. - lt was a boar fight? - Not so much a fight. lt was more, you know, like me getting gored. So, where's Mr. Locke? Uh... l don't think the hunt went well. That bald guy never came back. - They didn't bring back any food? - Did you hear what l said? Somebody might have died. We'll die if somebody doesn't do something. There you are. As promised, you and l will be dining on fresh catch of the day. - My fish! - Hope you don't mind alfresco. lt was no problem. That one gave me a hell of a tussle, but you have to get inside the mind of the fish. - l don't believe you. - l cornered it. What's the matter? Can't stand to see me fending for myself? - l am so sorry. l apologize. - What are you apologizing for? - For using this poor guy. - Oh, whatever. ln your twisted brain, you think this proves you can take care of yourself. - l told you l'd catch a fish, didn't l? - That's low, even for you. [Shannon] Oh, go rescue a baby bird or something. Rose, after the sun goes down, we're gonna burn the fuselage. lt's... lt's just something that we have to do. There's gonna be a memorial service back at the camp for those... ...for those who didn't make it, for everyone to say goodbye. - l'd like to be there for that. - Okay. Maybe if you wanted to say something, - you know, about your husband. - What? l'm saying, if you wanted to say goodbye to Bernard. Doctor, my husband is not dead. Rose, he was in the tail section of the plane. lt broke off in mid-flight. l'm sorry, but everyone who was in the rear of the plane is gone. They're probably thinking the same thing about us. [Rose] Doctor? You coming? l'm sorry. Guess l should have gotten the warranty. l suppose l'll just try again. Of course, l have no welding iron, no rivets, scorched wiring, and it seems l must continue to lie to anyone who asks me what l'm actually doing! Sayid. We'll try it again. We'll try it again. Kate! Excuse me. Hey. You okay? ls this when you say ''l told you so''? No. l'm not big on rubbing it in. Locke, um... Locke's gone. That thing, it was moving in his direction. There wasn't time. What's going on? Fuselage is ready to go. Some of the others decided... l guess there's gonna be some words said over the fire. - That's good. - Names read, l think. l don't think they're ready to hear about some things... Jack? Jack? Locke. Judith Martha Wexler from Denton, Texas. l guess she was gonna catch a connecting flight. She wore corrective lenses, and she was an organ donor. Or at least would have been. Steve and Kristen. l-l don't know their last name, but... ...they were really in love and were gonna be married. At least wherever they are now, they're not alone. [Claire] ...must have had children. A video store receipt lists overdue charges for <i>Willy Wonka</i> and <i>The Little Princess.</i> Looks like he hadn't traveled much, as far as l can tell from his passport. You seen Jack? [Claire continues] Seat 23C. Nice work. What? The boar. Nice work, you know. Killing it. Just thought l should say something. So, that thing... the... ...monster, whatever, she said it was headed right towards you. Did you see anything? Get any kind of look at it? No. The walkabouts we arrange here are not just some stroll through the park. lt's trekking across stretches of desert, rafting treacherous waters... You've got no idea who you're talking to. l'm well aware of what's involved, believe me. l probably know more than you. lt's a trying ordeal for someone in peak physical condition. l booked this tour a month ago. You've got my money. - l demand a place. - You misrepresented yourself. - l never lied. - By omission. You neglected to tell us about your condition. My condition is not an issue. l've lived with it for four years. Never kept me from doing anything. Unfortunately, it is an issue for our insurance company. l can't keep the bus waiting. lt isn't fair... Don't talk to me about fair! l'll get you on a plane to Sydney on our dime. lt's the best l can do. No, l don't want to go back to Sydney. Look, l've been preparing for this for years. Just put me on the bus right now. l can do this! No, you can't. Hey, hey, don't you walk away from me. You don't know who you're dealing with! Don't ever tell me what l can't do! This is destiny. This is destiny. This is my destiny. Listen, l'm supposed to do this, damn it! Don't tell me what l can't do! Don't tell me what l can't... [people screaming] [jet engine shrieking] [woman] Help me! Help! [Jack] You! Come on! Come over here! Get over here! Give me a hand!
