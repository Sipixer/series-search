Let you come alone. All of you have to go back. Is that what this is about? This is insane. You guys are crazy. - Kate - Jack, don't! - Sayid, where are you going? - I don't want any part of this. It's Jin! - How do you know he's alive?! - There's someone... Someone here in Los Angeles. Someone? who? The same person that's gonna show us How to get back to the island. Help! Anyone! Help! Help, jack! Help! anyone! Help! Help! Help! Help! It's okay. You're okay. Relax. Aah! Oh, god! Oh, god! Okay. - Oh, my god! - We can stand. - What? - We can stand. Oh, my god. It really happened. Kate. Kate. Kate, can you hear me? Jack? Are you okay? Are we... Yeah. We're back. What happened? 46 Hours Earlier I thought I said all of them. This is all I could get on short notice. Guess it'll have to do for now. All right. Let's get started. Shall we? What is this place? The dharma initiative called it the lamp post. This is how they found the island. Did you know about this place? No. No, I didn't. Is he telling the truth? Probably not. Here we go. All right. I apologize if this is confusing, but... Let's pay attention, yes? The room we're standing in was constructed years ago Over a unique pocket of electromagnetic energy. That energy connects to similar pockets all over the world. The people who built this room, however, - Were only interested in one. - The island. Yes. the island. They'd gathered proof that it existed. They knew it was out there somewhere, But they just couldn't find it. Then a very clever fellow built this pendulum On the theoretical notion that they should stop looking For where the island was supposed to be And start looking for where it was going to be. What do you mean, "where it was going to be"? Well, this fellow presumed, and correctly, as it turned out, That the island was always moving. Why do you think you were never rescued? Now while the movements of the island seem random, This man and his team created a series of equations Which tell us, With a high degree of probability, Where it is going to be at a certain point... In time. Windows, as it were, That while open, provide a route back. Unfortunately, These windows don't stay open for very long. Yours closes... In 36 hours. Um, I'm sorry. excuse me. Am I really hearing this? That's what this is about? You're all going back to the island willingly? Yes. why are you here, desmond? I came here to deliver a message. Daniel Faraday... Your son-- Sent me here. He wanted me to tell you That he and all the people on the island need your help. He said that only you could help them. He didn't say Jack. He didn't say Sun. He didn't say Ben. - He said you. - But I am helping, dear. Consider the message delivered. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, desmond, But the island isn't done with you yet. This woman cost me four years of my life-- Four years that I'll never get back because you told me That I was supposed to go to the island! That it was my bloody purpose! You listen to me, brother, and you listen carefully. These people-- they're just usin' us. They're playing some kind of game, And we are just the pieces. Whatever she tells you to do... Ignore it. You say the island's not done with me? Well, I'm done with the island. Jack... The binder in your hands Shows all the air routes that fly over the coordinates Where I believe the island will be In little more than a day from now. There's a commercial airliner flying from l.a. to Guam. It's going to go right through your window. Ajira Airways, flight 3-1-6. Is you have any hope of the island bringing you back, It must be that plane. You all need to be on it. It must be that flight. If you... Want to return, You need to recreate as best you can The circumstances That brought you there in the first place That means as many of the same people As you are able to bring with you. And what if we can't get anyone else to come with us? What if we're it? All I can tell you is the result would be... Unpredictable. So that's it? We just get on that flight, And we just hope that it works? That's all? No, that's not all, jack... At least, not for you. Come on in. Ben and sun-- Heard what they needed to hear, And this does not concern them. Oh. here we are. What's this? It's john locke's suicide note. Uh... I, uh... I didn't know. Well, why would you? Obituaries don't see fit To mention when people hang themselves, jack. Why would he kill himself? There are many reasons, I'm sure, But the only one that matters is this-- He is going to help you get back. John is going to be a proxy. A substitute. A substitute for who? Jack... Who do you think? You need to, as best you can, Recreate the conditions of the original flight... Which is why you need to Give john something of your father's. You have to get something that belonged to your father, And you need to give it to john. What? That's what you have to do. My father... Is gone. My father has been dead for three years. You want me to... A-and to give it to locke?! he's in a coffin! This is ridiculous. Oh, stop thinking how ridiculous it is And start asking yourself Whether or not you believe it's going to work. That's why it's called a leap of faith, jack. Where's sun? She left. And locke? I mean... his body? the coffin? I have a friend looking after it. I'll pick it up on my way to the airport. - What did she say to you, jack? - nothing that matters. Who is she? Why is she... helping us? How does she know all this? Thomas the apostle When jesus wanted to return to judea, Knowing that he would probably be murdered there, Thomas said to the others, "let us also go, that we might die with him." But thomas was not remembered for this bravery. His claim to fame came later... When he refused to acknowledge the resurrection. He just couldn't wrap his mind around it. The story goes... That he needed to touch jesus' wounds To be convinced. So was he? Of course he was. We're all convinced sooner or later, jack. Where are you going? Oh, I made a promise to an old friend of mine-- Just a loose end that needs tying up. See you at the airport, jack. Hello? Yeah, this is him. He did what? This is the fourth time he's left. He's gotta follow the rules, Or he'll have to move to our fully assisted facility. Yeah, I understand. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Here is my fraidy-cat rabbit! Hey, ray. - Hey, jack. - As for my next trick, I need someone to pick a card. - Wanna get out of here? - The sooner the better. Would you please pick one? look at it. mm-hmm. You wanna tell me why you took off this time, ray? Do I really need to answer that? Will you at least tell me where the bus was headed? Doesn't matter. Anywhere I go is somewhere better than here. - You packed a bag? - of course I did. One of these times, I'm actually gonna get away. They won't ever find me either. Take off again, they're gonna throw you outta here, ray. But what would I do without my magic shows? Let me help you unpack, granddad. So how are you, kiddo? You seeing anyone special? Whatever happened To the girl that you brought by with you that time? The pretty one with all the freckles? What was her name? Kate. We're not together anymore. Well, look at the bright side-- More time to come visit me. I'd love to, granddad. I really would, but... I think I might be... Might be going away for a while. Where's "away" exactly? Somewhere better than here. Are these yours, granddad? No. Those were your father's. Your mom sent me a box of his stuff after he died. Must've got mixed in when I packed for a quick getaway. These shoes... Can I take them? Be my guest. Kate? What are you doing here? Are you still going back to the island? Yeah. Yeah, I think I am. Then I'm going with you. Kate... What happened? where's aaron? where-- no, don't ask questions. If you want me to go with you... You'll never ask me that question again. You will never ask me about aaron. Do you understand, jack? Yes. Thank you. Morning. Morning. Uh, I made you some coffee, and there's orange juice. You still like milk and two sugars? Yeah, sure. Those don't make much sense for the island. You might want to consider hiking boots. Those were my father's. When I went to pick up his body in sydney, My dad didn't have any nice shoes. My mother wanted to have the funeral Soon as I landed back in l.a. But I thought, who the hell's gonna see his feet? And so i-i had these old white tennis shoes, And I just said, "use these. put these on him." 'cause he wasn't worth a nice pair of shoes to me. Or the time it would take to go out and get 'em. So why don't you get rid of 'em? Why hold on to something that makes you feel sad? Go ahead. I... I'll see you at the airport, okay? -Hello? -hello, jack. are you there? Yeah. yeah, what's u is everything all right? Listen, we don't have much time. I've been, uh... sidetracked, And I need you To pick up locke's body and take it to the airport. The coffin is at simon's butcher shop, Corner of grand and hayes. Why? wh-what's happened to you? Just do it. please. Are you jill? ben sent me. I know who you are, dr. shephard. come on in. What's in the bag? Sorry. Ben said to give you the van. I gotta pull it around back. give me about five minutes. Wherever you are, john... You must be laughing your ass off That I'm actually doing this. Because this... This is even crazier than you are. And here. You can have that back. I've already heard everything you had to say, john. You wanted me to go back. I'm going back. Rest in peace. Mr. shephard, if you'll just bear with me. The reason for transporting mr. bentham to guam? Uh, it was his-- these were his wishes. He wanted to be buried there. Who will be the recipient of the deceased upon arrival? Is there a funeral home or-- no, it's me. me. I'll be escorting the body. And your relation to the deceased? He was, uh, a friend. Now, mr. shephard, I have to inform you that Due to the increased security measures, we are required To open the casket and perform a screening. I assure you it's all done with care.
