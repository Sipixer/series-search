I'm not giving you anybody! - Dad! Dad! - Walt! Where is she? - You mean Kate? - I love her. Kate! Kate! Look here and here. You can see it's eroding up the spinal artery in the l5 area. Plus all this extradural growth-- I'm surprised it hasn't caused permanent ischemia. He says you don't need to talk in whispers. He knows he doesn't have a chance. Your father appreciates candor. We both do. Well, then tell him I'm very sorry, but he's not a candidate for surgery. The way the tumor is situated on the spine, it's just not possible to remove it. He wants to know why you won't try. Because what your father is looking for is not a surgical procedure. What he is looking for is a miracle. He said, "I did not come all this way for you, sir. I came for him." Miss Busoni, I, uh-- You fixed a woman with a crushed spinal column-- an impossible surgery. And now she walks, yes? I consulted many medical journals before making this trip here. Then you should know it was a very different case under very different circumstances. But a miracle, right? Look, everything that my father is saying-- the risks, the unlikelihood-- he's absolutely right. But will you try? I'll have to admit him in the next couple of weeks, run some tests. Locke? John! - Stay in there. Stay-- - - Michael! What are you-- - Stay in there, Jack! - Hey, whatever's going on-- Look, I'm going after my son. I'm going after my son, and nobody is going to stop me, okay? Okay? That is my right. That is a father's right. There's another way to go about this-- - Get in the damn room! - You gonna shoot me, Michael?! No. But I'll shoot your damn computer. That thing is not what you think it is anyway. You don't understand, man. You don't have any idea. Now get in there! Michael! Michael, listen, we can do this together, okay? I'll come with you. No. I have to do it... now. I have to do it alone. What happened? Michael knocked you out. Look over here. - Why would he... - He went after Walt. You feel nauseated? Sick? No, I'm okay. Good. Give me a boost up. It's no use. I bolted it shut from the inside. You did what? No point in changing the combination if you can get in through the air vent. That's really good thinking, John. You want to tell me why you let Michael in here? Uh, he... he wanted a gun. For shooting practice. Shooting practice. The button. - How long was I out? - About 20 minutes. We're on shift for the next four hours. There's nobody coming down here. Yeah, I know. We better hope Sawyer shows up to get his band-aid changed. Mornin'. Did you just throw a banana at me? Couldn't find any rocks. There are nicer ways to wake a man up, Freckles. Come on. It's time to go get your bandages changed. Well, why can't you do it for me? Because I'm not your nurse, and Jack's got the bandages. Of course he does. You want to give me a hand? Thanks. Come on. This place still creeps me out. You'll get used to it. Where is everybody? Jack? John? Maybe they went out for ice cream. Shh. - In here! Hey! - Jack? In here! In the armory! Michael locked us in here! - What did he say? - I got it. Hope you got the combo, doc. Right 3 times to 25. 25, got it. Left 2 times to 29. Right once to 40. Howdy, boys. - What are you doing, Jack? - We're going after him. Hey, what... what happened? Michael went after Walt. Went after Walt? Pulled a gun on me, put us both in there and went after Walt. Hey.  What are you doing? What does it look like? Comin' with ya. You're still on antibiotics. It's a good thing I'm traveling with my doctor then. How  is he? Thought you'd gone home. My home is a hotel room. I like it more here. Think you need to find a better hotel. You didn't answer my question. His counts aren't where I'd like 'em to be. You've been doing tests for a month now, Jack. I'm thorough. I have a confession to make. I don't believe in miracles. Yeah. Guess I'm not too sure about them, either. I bet your wife feels differently. Your wife. She's the woman you fixed, isn't she? Yes. I'm thorough, too. She must be a very special person to let you work until 4:30 in the morning. I completely lost track... I've gotta-- will you excuse me? Yes, of course. Go. Jack? Thank you. Yeah. Of course. - Good night. - Good night. Hey. How is he? Hey. Sorry to wake you. I gotta get up anyway. So how is he? About the same. Sarah, I'm sorry. I meant to... I just got... Hey... that's the price of being a miracle worker. Where are you going? I've gotta go to the gym, and then I've got some papers to grade. I didn't want to say anything until I knew either way, but, um... I was late, so I got a pregnancy test. Don't worry. It's negative. Do you, um... do you want to talk about it? What's to talk about? Sarah, I... See you later, Jack. Well? Well, I can't tell you it's definitely Michael's, but looks like his boot print. There's one over here, too. That sounds like a trail. - You got a gun for me? - You're not coming. - Excuse me? - You're not coming. Someone has to be here to take care of the button. So why should that person be me? - I can track, carry a gun-- - - You're not comin'. You're stayin'. All right? Let's go. What did she do to you? - What? - Kate. - What did she do? - She didn't do anything. Right. You yellin' at her 'cause she wanted to help get Mike back makes a lot of sense. Why don't you go back and see if I hurt her feelings? I'm just sayin'. Yeah. I know. You love her. What did you say? What? Does any of this look familiar from when you were coming back? Oh, yeah. There's my favorite leaf. How could I forget this place? What's wrong? When you came across the island, what side was the ocean on? You came from the east. Michael's heading north. What  the hell's that supposed to mean? That means he's not going back to where you came from. He's heading somewhere else. *The sun's very strong today. *I don't need a hat. *I know. *Just wear it. *I think something's wrong. - Hello, Hurley. - Hey. Cool hat, dude. - Is Kate all right? - Uh... yeah. I guess Michael took off. *What's he saying? What do you mean, he took off? He stole some guns, and he went all commando. Said he was going after Walt. Later, dudes. Gotta get to the hatch. *What are you doing? *He said they just left. *If I hurry I can catch up... *You're not going anywhere. *Don't go! *Don't walk away from me! *While you were on that raft... *do you know how worried I was? *I didn't know if you were dead or alive. *I was out of my head. *I won't go through taht again. *Michael's my friend. *I'm your wife. Hey, doc. Wanna slow down? Take a break a minute? Good idea. He still heading north? Yup. You think he's lost? Doesn't seem to be. Trail's as straight as the interstate. The path of a man who knows where he's going. Where are you going, Jack? What? Well, let's say we catch up with him-- Michael. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna bring him back. What  if he doesn't want to come back? I'll talk him into coming back. This is the second time he's gone after Walt. He knocked me out. He locked us both up. Something tells me he might be past listening to reason. What, you think we should just let him go, write him off? Who are we to tell anyone what they can or can't do? It's not too late to go back. The tumor's aggressive, but your father could lead a very normal life for at least another year. Go back? Go back where? Home? Have you changed your mind, Jack? No.  No. Is that it? Even if you don't succeed, you're giving us a chance. That's all we wanted. I'll come out and check on you before I scrub in. Okay. Am I interrupting? No. I was just leaving. I'll see you in the morning. I'll see you in the morning. I.T.R. Reports need to be signed by you as chief resident. What? Careful. There's a line, son. You know it's there. And pretending it's not... that would be a mistake. Guess you would know. It may be okay for some people, Jack, but not for you. Sure Mike went this way? Why do you ask? Oh, I don't know, Mr. Clean. I probably would have gone around Mount Vesuvius. Why did you pick that name? Ain't it obvious? All you need's an earring and a mop. No, your name. Why did you pick "Sawyer"? What do you mean, "pick"? After the census, Hurley gave me the flight manifest. Your name is James. Right? James Ford. What's it to you? Just an interesting name to choose, is all. Who'd you get it from? Who says I got it from anybody? - Michael! - Jack, get down! - Michael! - Jack! Jack! Michael! - Michael! - Jack. What? He's close. Yeah, and if he was shooting at someone, you want 'em coming back? Personally, hell, yeah. You said these people were two days across the island. Yeah, and they took Cindy less than a mile from our camp. Over here. - Shell casings. How many? - Three. Michael's. You boys deaf? I heard at least seven shots. You heard 'em, Daniel Boone. What's your count? Yeah. Seven sounds about right. It's gettin' dark. Which way did Mike go? What? You out here for Michael or just payback for getting shot? Why are you out here, doc? You got your reasons, and I got mine. Jack. Jack! - I had it. - I know, son. I got it! I got it all. I mean, I had it! He was a sick old man on a table for seven and a half hours. His heart gave out. It's nobody's fault. Gotta go tell her. Yeah, well, I've already done that. Lest you forget, I am still chief of surgery. Where is she? - Maybe you should go home. - Where is she? She's gone. Jack... go home. Jack? Gabriela. My father told me that you'd gone. I, uh... - I, uh... - Thank you. Thank you for trying. Gabriela... I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I couldn't... - Wha... - It's okay. I... I'm... I can't. What do you mean, you lost it? He's a man, not a boar. The signs' more subtle. I need light to follow. Here. Light. I think we'd better head back. What? - Just find the trail, John. - I've lost the trail. You don't just lose a trail. You just don't want to find him. Yeah, that's right, Jack. I've been running through the jungle toward the sound of gunfire because I don't care about Michael. Don't turn around on me, John. You're not gonna get him to come back, and you know it! You know what happens if we just turn around and go back? We're never gonna see him again, and that's gonna be on us-- on you and on me. You're exactly right, Jack! But if I were you, I'd listen to Mr. Locke. Who are you? He's the son of a bitch who shot me on the raft. Why don't you point the gun down? Ow! Probably be best if we just keep our hands at our sides, gentlemen. Where's Michael? Don't worry about Michael. He's not gonna find us. What do you want? Why don't you build us a fire, John? Think it's time we all had a talk. "Geronimo Jackson"? Huh. Whoo. As an expert in all things musical, I never heard of these guys, shocking as that may be. "Geronimo Jackson." This looks sweet. Let's give her a rip. Yeah. So what do you think's the story with that Libby chick? The story? She's kind of cute, right? You know, in a "I've been terrorized by the others for 40 days" kind of way. Yeah, there is that. I think I have a chance with her. I mean, it's a classic desert island scenario. If I ever had a shot, this is it. You  think Claire's missed me yet? Dude, it's been a day. This music is quite depressing. We can change it, dude. You ever hear of Geronimo Jackson? I'm afraid not. Where's Jack and Locke? Oh, they went after Michael. Michael? Yeah, he's run after Walt again. Everyone's gone to bring him back. Who's everyone? Everyone-- Jack, Sawyer, Locke. Oh, and Kate. Just sit down, Jack. Nobody gonna hurt you. I come in peace. How do you know our names? You took Walt. Walt's fine. He's a very special boy. Look, you said you wanted to talk. Talk. Let me ask you this-- how long you been here on the island? 50 days. Ooh, 50 days. That's, what, almost two whole months. Tell me, you go over a man's house for the first time, do you take off your shoes? Do you put your feet up on his coffee table? Do you walk in the kitchen and eat food that doesn't belong to you, open the door to rooms you got no business opening? You know, somebody a whole lot smarter than anybody here once said that, "since the dawn of our species, man has been blessed with curiosity." You know the other one about curiosity, don't you, Jack? This is not your island. This is our island. And the only reason you're living on it is 'cause we let you live on it. I don't believe you. You don't believe what? I think you've got one guy up there with a gun. I think there's more of us than there are of you. I think if you had any real strength, you wouldn't have had to send a spy. Ethan. That's an interesting theory. Light 'em up! We got a misunderstanding, Jack... your people, my people. So listen carefully. Right here there's a line. You cross that line, we go from misunderstanding to... something else. Now give me your weapons, turn around. Go home. No. - Jack, maybe-- - No! I hoped it wouldn't come to this. Bring her out, Alex! She was following you. Like I said-- curiosity. Don't. Jack, the decision you gotta make right now is this-- Can you live with the fact that I shot this woman right in front of you... When you could have saved her life by giving up and going home? Now you gonna give me your guns, turn around and walk away. It's your call, Jack. If you touched a hair on her head, I'll-- Shut up! I'm gonna count to three. One. two. Stop. Now them. Give me the other one, too. You and me ain't done, Zeke. Jack, I... - You all right? - Yeah. *What are you you doing out here alone? *I couldn't sleep. *Are they back? *Not yet. *Honey... *I don't like being told what to do. *Being told what to do was my life for four years... *I didn't like it much either. *Right. *I don't suppose you did. I was just trying to help, Jack. When you told me not to go, I just... I made a mistake. Hey. Could you just talk to me for a second? I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry, too. - Hey. - Hey. How did it go? He died. I'm sorry. Yeah. Me too. - Who was over? - My mom. Her bridge game okay? Oh, yeah. She's on a streak. Did you-- did you eat? Yeah. No, I--it's... it's late. I'm fine. You don't have to do that. It's therapeutic. Cheaper than a shrink. How'd the daughter take it? What's her name-- Gabriela? She kissed me. Yeah, she... she kissed me, and... I kissed her back. I... I don't know. I don't know how it happened. I just... I made a mistake. I made a mistake, and this is my fault. It's my fault that you and me-- I haven't been here, Sarah. I mean... We don't even talk anymore. I hate what's happening to us, and I promise you that things are gonna be different. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna work less. I'm gonna be here for you. Okay? I'm gonna fix this. We're gonna go back to the way things were. I'm gonna fix this. I'm gonna fix this. Jack. Jack... - I'm leaving you. - What? I was already leaving you. That's why my mother was here. She was helping me pack. I've been seeing someone... someone else. I have to... I can't stay. Sarah... You... you will always need something to fix. Good-bye. See you, James. Don't beat yourself up, Freckles. If he'd told me to stay behind, I'd have done the same damn thing. Oh. Hello. What's the matter? What's the matter with your little foot? Hi. Hi! Who's that? You don't like your uncle Johnny? What is he doing to your toy? What is he doing? Hey, go away. I barely have enough food to feed myself. Here. Get that. Go! I see you found a new friend. Progress. Hear you were out lookin' for Michael. Yeah. He ran off looking for his kid again? Not much you can do about that then. Is it true that you killed one of them? One of who? Them. Sayid tells me that you're a cop. I was a cop. Can I ask you something? Shoot. How long do you think it
