Kate will position in the jungle roughly two kilometers in. And the third, l'll take to high ground. [buzzing radio] Where are you? Where are you? Mayday! Mayday! Anybody out there? Hello! We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 81 5. Please copy. John, tell me exactly what happened. John? Locke! - [faint] lt fell... the plane. - Locke said you fell from a cliff. - lt's because of the hatch. - What hatch? John said not to tell. What'd Locke do? - Where's Shannon? - l don't know. - Well, she's his sister... - l don't know where she is! Jack. Where are you going? To find John Locke. ls there anything l can do for you? Sun said he wouldn't let Jack take his leg. Didn't want him using up the antibiotics. She said he knew what was happening to him. That he was brave. [PA] This is a special security announcement. Heathrow Airport Authority reminds traveling passengers... [unlocking handcuffs] Okay, Sayid. [woman] Eighteen hours in a holding cell should be enough. Let's get to it, shall we? l'm Melissa Cole from Central lntelligence. [Cole] This is Robbie Hewitt from ASlS. - You're gonna do us a favor. - A favor? Three hundred pounds of C-4 explosives were stolen from an army base outside of Melbourne. The men responsible are members of a terrorist cell intent on disrupting the coalition presence in lraq. Three hundred pounds of C-4. l want it back. You're the ClA. - Plant a few bugs. - Oh, we have. - You're gonna get inside first... - l am lraqi. l am not a terrorist. [Cole] We didn't snatch you up because you were a terrorist, Sayid. We snatched you up because you know one. Essam Tazir. Your roommate at Cairo University. - [Hewitt] He's a member of the cell. - And why should l care? - You'd be saving lives. - l repeat. Why should l care? We know where she is. Seven years since you left lraq. Six months here, three months there. [Cole] Always moving. There's only two reasons why a man would do that, Sayid. Either he's running away from something, or looking for something. [Cole] Noor Abed Jaseem. Nobody calls her Noor. You want to know where she is? Then we're going to Sydney. [rustling] [panting] Kate, what are you doing out here? - Looking for you. - Well, you found me. You're walking in circles. You need to come back. Not without Locke. - You haven't slept, gave Boone blood... - Locke lied. - Well, now you're... - He lied, Kate. Boone did not fall off any cliff. His leg was crushed. And l based my medical treatment on his lie. People are scared and upset. [Kate] They don't know what's going on. We need you to come back, Jack. [Kate] Please? [out of breath] Shannon. Do you wanna...? Do you wanna say something? No. [Sayid] l didn't know Boone very well, and for that l'm sorry. On our sixth day here, [Sayid] a woman named Joanna died. She drowned. And Boone was the first one into the water. l didn't know him. [Sayid] But l'll remember his courage... ...and l know he will be missed. [Locke] lt was my fault. We found a plane. A Beechcraft, in the jungle. lt was lodged in the canopy. [stuttering] l would have gone up, but... My leg was hurt, so he... There was a radio inside, and he thought he could... His weight must have made the plane shift and it fell and... Happened because he was trying to help us. He was a hero. [Jack] Where were you? Where were you? Where the hell were you, you son of a bitch? - What did you do to him? - Wait! Jack, stop! - [Jack] What did you do? - [Locke] Wait! [Jack] Where were you? You just left him to die. You lied to me! Where were you? - [Charlie] Jack, it's okay. - Where were you? - Where were you? - [Charlie] Jack. - [Kate] Jack. - Hey, hey. Jack, what's the matter? Are you okay? Oh, God. Get some water! Breathe. He's okay. [Charlie] Just breathe. - He's lying. - You're suffering from fatigue. - Locke told Boone not to tell. - Not to tell about what? Something about a hatch. Locke's hiding something. - Jack, listen... - The man is hiding something. Listen to me. We need the doctor on this island to get some sleep. - l'm fine. l don't need it. - Jack. You need some rest. [Sun] Come on. [man speaking Arabic] [man] Sayid? Sayid. - lt is you. - Essam. So you haven't forgotten me. Hardly. - What are you doing in Sydney? - l've been traveling. And you? l live here. Almost a year now. - l'm a tree cutter. l cut trees. - Sounds like good, honest work. So much for my philosophy degree. Whatever puts food on your table. How is Zahraa? She died. A stray bomb, while she was shopping for a dress. l'm so sorry. Listen, we've got a lot of catching up to do. [Essam] Why don't you come over? l'd love to. [gun firing] Damn it. l'm out of ammo. - Use the crowbar. - That only works on the zombies. - Not the big bugs. - lndeed. The three of you live here? Sydney's very expensive. lt's the best we can afford. And what is it you do? - At the moment, l'm at liberty. - He's on holiday. You'll love the beaches here. [Essam] There is something to be said for Australian women. l've had the misfortune of being landlocked for several years. The last beach l was at was Sharm El Sheikh with you, Essam, remember? Before our English exams? l hear the beaches here are very nice. Especially the women. Perhaps we can go. So tell me, exactly what kind of trees do you cut? - [man] Who are you? - l was a communications officer. Sayid was Republican Guard. He knows things. Perhaps it's not happenstance that you and Essam met at the mosque. Perhaps it is fate. lt's okay. Look, l'm fine. Really. Okay? You need rest, Claire. Sun, tell her. ln a hospital, they would have you sleep. The nurses would take your baby. But l'm not in a hospital. All the more reason to take extra care, Claire. l can take care of Turnip-Head for a while. Turnip-Head? lt's what l'm calling him till you give him a name. 'Cause his head looks like a turnip. What if he needs something, okay? You'll be there after you sleep. No, okay. No. Claire, no one is going to take this baby away from you. You don't know that. You can't say that. l won't let it happen. Just be really careful, okay? lf he gets hot, take his blanket off. - His neck. Around his neck. - l got him. This was his. [Locke] l didn't go through it. Thank you. You're welcome. [distant thunderhead] Storm coming. l should have said no. First time he offered to hunt with me, l should have said no. He would've gone anyway. Yeah, l suppose he would've. l know how confused and angry you must be right now. l can't say l understand what you're going through, but... l know what it feels like when you lose family. l hope you can forgive me. l'm sorry. You asked if you could do anything for me. Anything. John Locke killed my brother. Will you do something about that? - A little more. - No. - You need your blood sugar level up. - Enough already. l've rested. - Jack... - l'm fine. Where are you going? - l'm gonna talk to Locke. - You need to lie down. - No, l don't. - l strongly advise it. You advise? Advice? What...? All right, what's going on now? Lie down. Okay? l crushed up some sleeping pills, put 'em in your juice. Why would you...? You drugged me? Yeah. [groan] Okay. 'Night. How did you get that? War wound. - Looks more like a surgical scar. - Like l said, war wound. The plane's radio. Was Boone able to pick up a signal? l was on the ground. All l could hear was static. - So it was working. - Yeah. But l can't imagine it survived the fall. Some of its parts might work in the transmitter l'm building for the raft... ...if you'd be willing to take me. Of course. - [Sayid] How did you find this plane? - [Locke] Luck. You and Boone were hunting? - That a question? - Yes. Boar got scarce a couple weeks back. We weren't hunting, we were exploring. So you just happened upon a Beechcraft perched in the trees? Yep. At the funeral, you said your leg was injured. lt was just a charley horse. - A cramp. - l know what a charley horse is, John. Back in lraq, you were an interrogator? - ls that a question? - Yeah. A long time ago, l was. Well, you haven't lost your touch. Why would l interrogate you, John? Jack called me a liar in front of every man, woman and child l've come to know over the past month. There's a part of you that thinks maybe there isn't a plane here at all. l know when l'm being lied to. There's a plane. Like l said, you haven't lost your touch. [Sayid] You've lost your edge, old man. [Essam] l never had one when l played you. Were you always this slow? Come on, let's play. You have to get out of that apartment. Practice more. Haddad would like that. More blending in with the community. He's got his eye on a target. What makes you say that? For two weeks, he's been asking me about explosives. Blast radius. Transport. Haddad's very thorough. Has he gotten hold of any yet? Explosives? l don't know. All l know is there's going to be an operation. And there is going to be a martyr. You? Haddad told me this morning. Come on, let's keep playing. - Essam. - l'm going to wipe the floor with you. What is it? What is it? l don't think l can do it. - [Cole] You're kidding me, right? - Listen to me. l can get Essam to turn himself in. - Does he know where the C-4 is? - The other two are the ones you want. - Essam's confused... - Does he know where it is? - No. - Then he's useless. These cells run top down. lt's all need-to-know. The recruit's handed a bomb and a target at the last possible moment. The way to find the C-4 is wait for Essam to walk out with a target to hit. He's in over his head, doesn't know why... That's why you convince him to go through with it. No. No. l will not. - Excuse me? - l'm done. lt's over. You're not even close to being done, my friend. - What are you going to do, arrest me? - No. We'll arrest her. Your girlfriend's an lraqi living abroad with a record of insurgency. Wouldn't it be terrible if she got picked up as an enemy combatant? So, if you want any chance of ever seeing her again, go and talk your good friend Essam into blowing himself up. - [baby crying] - ~ <i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i> ~ <i>Climbed up the spout</i> ~ <i>Down came the rain</i> and drowned the spider out - ~ <i>When the...</i> - Dude, it's ''washed.'' ''Washed the spider out.'' Unless there's some kind of British version. Okay. ~ <i>Down came the rain</i> and washed the spider... - Oh, bollocks. Shh. Shush. - What's the matter, man? l can't get the bloody thing to stop crying. Maybe he's hungry. No. Claire nursed him five times. He make any deposits, you know, diaper-wise? [crying continues] All right. Time to break out the big guns. ~ <i>Whoa! I feel good</i> ~ <i>I knew that I would, now</i> ~ <i>I feel good</i> ~ <i>I knew that I would, now</i> ~ <i>So good</i> So good ~ <i>I got you</i> Bom-bom-bom-bom [screams] Ow! [crying loudly] Dude, that's all l got. Heroin. Cargo hold is full of it. [Locke] Best l can figure, they were smugglers. The plane was perched in the canopy? Right up there. And Boone climbed up by himself, because of your charley horse. Yes. That's right. Why did you lie? l made a mistake. l'm going to salvage what l can of the radio. [Sayid] lf we leave now, we should beat the storm back. Why don't you trust me, Sayid? For one thing. You've been carrying a gun you've told no one about. We found one of the smugglers about half a click west of here dressed as a priest, Nigerian currency in his pockets. And this. Now you're armed and l'm not. Does that earn me any trust? You gave this to me because l caught you concealing it. - That earns you adaptability. - [gun clicks] l'll tell you something you don't know. Please do. A week after the crash, there was a cave-in. - Jack was trapped. Remember? - Of course. You, Kate and Sawyer went out into the jungle to triangulate a signal. Yes. You were hit, knocked unconscious. When you woke up, the transceiver, your equipment was destroyed. That was me. This is one time you better not be telling the truth. - lt was in everyone's interest. - Ruined my chance to find the source... Of a distress call saying, ''They're dead. lt killed 'em all.'' ls that a place you really want to lead people to? Why wait all this time? Why not tell me then? Because back then you wouldn't have engaged in a reasonable debate. Nobody else would. You were so focused to get off the island you weren't seeing things clearly, like what's happening with the raft. - Did you burn the raft? - No, Sayid, l didn't. What is the hatch? The hatch? Boone mentioned it before he died. The hatch? Two hatches on a plane. Could be forward... or aft. [Essam] l'm not sure if l can do this. You wouldn't be a martyr if you didn't have to overcome fear. l'm not afraid to die. lt's all the innocent lives, all those people. The imam preaches peace, Sayid, that every human life is sacred. lt's true. lnnocent lives will be lost, in service of a greater good. What if l'm doing this because l'm angry? What if l'm doing this because they killed her? What if you are? Should we just accept what happened to Zahraa? What about others like her? We just accept their deaths? Because if we do, it means ultimately we care nothing about them. l lost someone too, Essam. l will never be whole again. There need to be consequences for those responsible. That's my duty. That is how l will honor her. Haddad was right. lt was fate that brought us back together. Sayid... ...will you do this with me? l will. [Sayid] How are you? - Do you want to take a walk? - Sure. - l spoke to Locke. - What did he say? He took me to the plane. l believe what happened was an accident. Then why did he lie? l have no idea. But l don't believe he meant to harm Boone. So that's it? l know how strong the need can be to find someone to blame... You don't get it, do you? - Shannon. - Just forget about it, okay? How much weight can this hold? l don't know. A lot. Enough. - [speaks Korean] - Yeah. Tighter. Got it. - What if it tips over? - lt won't. That's why we made it this wide. [Michael] There, that should do it. Right? Good? Good. - [Michael] All right. - What if a shark attacks? Sharks ain't getting anywhere near us, man. What if we die? We are not gonna die. - Boone died. - [baby crying] Michael, do you know anything about babies? l can't get this guy to be quiet. - Walk with him. He'll calm down. - l tried that. - Jin, have you seen Sun? - Huh? Sun. l need some help with this baby. - No. - Okay. Chucky, you wanna keep that kid quiet? Baby Huey's like nails on a chalkboard. Aww, there you go. You happy now? [crying] l was. lf you're gonna play nursemaid at least do the damn job. Hey. Hey, say something else. - Just say something, say anything. - Okay, fine. l liked that thing a lot better inside than l like it outside. [cooing] What? Hey. [groans] Brought you something to eat. - What's in it? Chloroform? - Soup. Thanks, but l think l'll... - Who was in here? - l don't know. What's the matter? - Was anybody in here? - No, why are you...? The key to the gun case. lt's gone. - Maybe it fell off this morning. - lt didn't. What's going on? Locke took the key. He's after the guns. [Kate] l haven't seen him. You don't know... - [Jack] No? Then who was it? - [Sayid] Jack. lt wasn't Locke. - [Haddad] Sayid. - [tires screech] Get in. lt's time. Stay relaxed and focused. Drive with the windows down. The fresh air will keep you alert. You will need to wear these. lf you run into any problems... [clicking gun safety off] ...use this. You are heroes. Good luck. [engine starts] Essam, stop. Don't be nervous, brother. We'll be okay. l'm working with the ClA. What? l'm going to give you ten minutes to get away before l call them. - You set me up? - Essam, just go. - Why would you do this to me? - You're wasting time. We were going to do this together. You said you lost someone. Her name is Nadia. We were separated years ago. They know where l can find her. You used me to find a woman? - You talked me into this. - Essam, don't. - lt was for the greater good. - l'm begging you to go. You said you were my brother. You're supposed to be my friend! l am your friend. A friend who told me to do this for Zahraa, just so you could find some woman that you love? Well, Sayid, l hope she makes you whole again. - Essam! - [gun discharges] [thunder] Go! Go. She doesn't believe me, Sayid. [Sayid] Shannon. Shannon. - Please listen to me. - He did it. l know it. You're not thinking rationally. You've never fired a gun before. - Shannon. You don't want to do this. - Yes, l do. lf you do it, you can never take it back. Stay back! What did you do to him? l told you it was an accident. Shannon. Jack, you told me he was a liar. [Shannon screaming] No! [Shannon screams] [Shannon screaming] - [Sayid] l'm sorry. - [Shannon] Don't. - Get away. - Shannon. [Sawyer] ''The low rumble breaks the crisp fall air as a flash of red streaks down the maple-dappled Vermont highway.'' [cooing] ''The 32-valve V8 engine purrs as the transmission clicks down a gear and the vehicle unleashes 400 horses and 350 pound<i>l</i>feet of rear-wheel torque.'' - [crying] - Keep going. Keep going! - Charlie... - Shh. [Sawyer] ''Beneath the hood, the 4.4-liter power plant features an integrated supercharger mated to a six-speed transmission with a manual sequential shift feature.'' - [baby cries] - Keep going. ''This smooth-riding sports car offers a bewitching blend of pace, comfort and economy.'' [Kate] She just needs time. [Kate] She's been through a lot. Time won't make a difference. Perhaps l made a mistake. You couldn't let her kill Locke. You had no choice. There's always a choice. She lives in lrvine, California, just south of Los Angeles. Works as a lab tech in a medical testing company. Plane ticket. Walking around money. You're on an Oceanic flight to LA. lt leaves in two hours. [Sayid] What happens to his body? He was a terrorist, so he's not exactly getting a state funeral. What happens to his body? After it's released, he'll be cremated. A Muslim man is supposed to be buried. Yeah? Well, there's no one to claim the body. l'll claim him. You can't claim him on a plane in two hours. Then change my flight to tomorrow. How's your head? - lt'll heal. - Another war wound. l know what it cost you... ...to do what you did. Thank you. l did it because l sense you might be our best hope of surviving here. But l don't forgive what you did, and l certainly don't trust you. And now, you're going to take me to the hatch.
