Yeah, you're going into the jungle and get some dynamite and blow open the hatch, and then you're gonna hide everyone inside. No. Stop! Stop it! Stop it! We can't! Stop! Don't light it! Nobody can tell ya there's only one song worth singin' they may try and sell ya 'cause it hangs them up to see someone like you but you've gotta make your own kind of music sing an old-fashioned song make your own kind of music even if nobody else sings along you're gonna be nowhere the loneliest kind of lonely it may be rough going just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do but you've gotta... 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 4, 8, we're dead, 15, doomed, dead... Hurley, are you okay? Oh, yeah, awesome. I just have to pee. Great idea, you two-- go look in the burning death hole. What is it? Doesn't matter what it is. We blew the door so we could get everyone inside this thing so they'd be safe. That plan is not gonna work. We'll never get everyone down in time. - Water. - Shallow. Sounds like a puddle. - Like, what, 40 feet down? - 50, tops. We could use the wire we pulled from the fuselage, rig up a harness. - John. We're leaving now. - Yes. Great idea. Let's do that. We all went through a lot to get here, Jack. The ladder's broken. You're gonna lower 40 people down there one by one? They're waiting for us to come back and tell them what to do. So let's forget about the harnesses. Jack? What? Why don't we all just calm down here? Look, if you want to go exploring in the morning, that's fine. But tonight, we're done. I'm gonna go get the dynamite that we didn't use, and we're heading back to the caves. How about you pack it up, John? Sure. Of course. Okay. Why don't you want to go down there, Jack? Female, late 20s, no I.D. She coded twice on the way over here. Where's the other one? Right behind us. They're on their way. Fire department had to use the jaws. What do we got here? Female, late 20s. What the hell is that thing? Piece of the steering column. All right, let's go. Keep that collar steady. - Page my father? - Already did. - Tell me. - Her tire blew. Car jumped the divider, went head-on with an S.U.V. BP's dropping. - Was she driving? - Yeah. Alone. Where's the driver of the S.U.V.? Adam Rutherford. 57. Chest trauma. No breath sounds. - Tube Mr. Rutherford while I-- - I can't intubate. You got to. Dr. Sheppard, her B.P.'s 80 over 60. Okay. I need a syringe, a big one. You, hold pressure. 88 over 52. No radial pulse. I know. I know. Sacs flooded. - Where's that-- - Right here. - Got it? - Yep. B.P. stabilizing. Tme of death 8:15 a.m. Okay. Get me a blood gas and a c-spine. Get her up to I.C.U. and keep her immobilized. I want to dance... wedding. Did you hear that? Sweetie, you need to take it easy, okay? Just relax. What did she say? She said she has to dance at her wedding. Okay? No one is out there. No one is coming. But the french woman said-- the french woman is missing a bloody wing nut, you know? I mean, it was all bollocks. It was a ghost story. She set the fire herself. What? Nothing. Has anyone seen Vincent? The dog? Anyone seen him? Has anyone seen the dog? Where are you going? I lost the damn dog. Why'd you do that? Why'd you light the fuse, man? Why wouldn't I light the fuse? Uh, maybe because I was running towards you, waving my arms, yelling, "don't do that"? Well, you got a point there. I guess I was just excited to get inside. I mean, that's why we came here, isn't it? That's why we went all the way out to "the black rock" and why we got the dynamite to blow the hatch. We did it so that we could get inside, Hugo. And to save everybody's lives. And to save everyone's lives. Or maybe it was just our destiny. Right, John? Maybe. Guys, uh, it's the hatch door. You'd better see this. Vincent! This is not a good idea. I saw him five minutes ago. Besides, you're the one who said there wasn't anyone out here. I said we didn't see anyone. The dog will come back on his own. He always does. Watching that dog was the one thing anybody ever asked me to do. If something happens to him... When was the last time you slept or had something to eat? You're exhausted. I can't tell that kid I lost his dog 'cause I was exhausted. I'll circle around behind him. Okay. Vincent! Sayid! Sayid! Where are you?! Sayid! Sayid?! Walt? Shh. What are you doing here? Shannon! What is it? What? Why do you wanna get down there so bad? -Ly. Why do I want to get down there so badly? Jack thinks I'm crazy, doesn't he? Why, 'cause you want to drop into a hatch that's been locked from the inside by a foot-thick steel door that says "quarantine"? Well, look at the bright side-- the damage is done. "Bright side." And if Jack thinks I've lost it, I can't blame him, really. Then again, five hours ago, I was pulled into a hole by what appeared to be a column of black smoke. Did you see it, Kate? Then I guess we're both crazy. Wonder what Jack thinks he saw. You should go ahead, man. Don't want Locke making time with your girl. Joke, dude. Not really in the mood, Hurley. Really? Wow. Usually you're like Mr. Ha ha. There you go. Life's not so bad, right? I mean, sure, the others are coming to, like, eat us all, and every once in a while someone blows up all over you, but we do get to sleep in every morning. Uh-huh. And the numbers? What? "The numbers are bad." That's what you were yelling right when I tackled you. - Yeah, it's kind of a long story. - I got time. - You'll think I'm crazy. - Try me. A while ago, I was in this kind of psych ward, and there was this guy Leonard. And all the time I knew him, all he ever said were these numbers-- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, over and over and over again. And they kind of got stuck in my head. So when I got out-- well, actually, a couple months after I'd got out, I was buying a frozen burrito, and I thought, "hey, I should play the lottery." And I guess those numbers were still stuck in my head. So I played them, and I won $114 million. And that's when it started happening. My grandpa died. My house caught on fire. The chicken joint that I worked at got hit by a meteor-- well... actually, meteorite. Okay, so tonight I see the same friggin' numbers on that hatch thing, just written on the side. And that's why I tried to stop it, because that thing is cursed, man. You were in a psych ward? - I'm not crazy. - I'm not saying you are. So? What, that's it? That's all? - What do you want me to say? - How about you believe me, man? Hurley, they're numbers. What's that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you? - Bedside manner. - Yeah, that. Yours sucks, dude. What happened to him? Just try to relax, okay? The car that I hit. The other driver was older. He died in the E.R. I can't feel anything. I know. What's happened to me? You have a fracture dislocation of your thoracic lumbar spine with multiple crushed vertebrae. Your back is broken. Your spleen is ruptured and bleeding into your abdomen, and that has to be stopped. I'm gonna perform surgery and repair as much damage as possible, but even the most optimistic result puts the likelihood of retaining any feeling or mobility anywhere below the waist at... extremely unlikely. Oh. Dr. Shephard? May I have a word, please? So? What did I do wrong? You did something wrong? You're frowning. My face is always this way. Dad, hey, come on. Let's hear it. You might want to try handing out some hope every once in a while. Even if there's a 99% probability that they're utterly, hopelessly screwed, folks are much more inclined to hear that 1% chance that things are gonna be okay. Her spine's crushed. I tell her that everything's gonna be okay, that's false hope, dad. But maybe. Maybe. But it's still hope. I know what I saw. It was him. It was Walt. Shannon, please lower your voice. You'll upset the rest of the group. I heard whispers. - Where? - Everywhere. - What whispers? - I don't know. Them. Do you think something happened to the raft? Nothing happened to the raft. Walt is with your husband-- Sayid, I know what I saw. They're back. Uh... Locke found, uh... a hatch in the ground about a half mile from here. We left to blow it open so that we could hide inside, so all of us could hide inside in case... but that doesn't matter now because it's not gonna work. There's no way for all of us to get down in there tonight. Jack? Where's Dr. Arzt? Uh, he didn't make it. Did you see them? Did you see the others? Hey, Shannon, there are no others! We've already had this conversation! Hey! Everything's gonna be okay. Let's just-- let's take it easy. We're gonna be all right. We're gonna stay here tonight, okay? Together. We've still got four guns. We'll put lookouts at all the entrances. We're all gonna be safe as long as we stay together. The sun comes up in three hours, and we're all gonna be here to see that happen. I promise. John, what are you doing? I'm getting some cable. What for? It's for the hatch. I'm going in. Do you really think that's the smartest thing to do right now, John? I doubt it. In fact, you're right. Safest thing is to stay here, wait for morning, wait for these "others," to see if they ever show up, wait for the brave folks on the raft to bring help. But me, I'm tired of waitin'. So do you believe it? Believe what? That everything's gonna be okay. Yeah. I do. That's kind of unlike you. The whole glass-half-full thing. There's a glass? You did a good thing, saying what you said... and taking care of everybody and just giving them something to count on. If you weren't here, Jack... I'm going to the hatch. I understand why you can't go. I mean, they need you here. I get it. I do. But Locke's going into that thing whether you like it or not. And if he falls and breaks his neck... Live together, die alone, right? Right. Your fiancée was seriously injured. It could take as long as 10, maybe 12 hours. I won't know how extensive the damage is until I get inside. She was going for a dress fitting and to look at tablecloths. When is it-- the wedding? Uh, it's eight months. Well, I'm sure Sara will have recovered by then-- "Recovered," um...what does that mean? There will be ongoing physical therapy. But if she works really hard-- Will we be able to, uh... you know, make love? You need to know that there's a chance Sara might very well need professional care for the rest of her life. Like, she won't be able to go to the bathroom by herself? Come here. Come here. I want to tell you a little secret. Come on. Closer. It's okay. I know I'm not gonna be dancing anymore. And I can still roll around at my wedding. You're invited, okay? I'm gonna fix you. Expected to find you halfway down there by now. I was waitin' for you. So you want me to go down first? Hell, you're lighter. I can belay you down and bring you back up just as easy. The shaft might get narrower down there, too. You left out the part where you just want to see if I get eaten by something. Yeah, well, that, too. - Not too tight? - I got it. Okay. Wait. What do I say if I need to stop? "Stop." Mmm. Right. Okay. Let's go. Aah! Kate! Are you all right? Yeah! Uh... I dropped the light! Maybe we should... Well, okay, then. One. Two. Three. Four. Stop! What is it? John! I think there's something down-- Kate, are you all right?! Kate! Kate! Kate! You're kidding, right? You're going back? Yeah. What about all that stuff you said about waiting till morning and watching the sunrise? I changed my mind. Kate! Locke! Ohh! Damn it! You all right, brother? I'm fine. I'm fine. Take it easy. Keep the weight off. Here, let me have a look. Does this hurt? Well, you haven't sprained it, then. I don't fancy your chances of catching up with me tonight, though. I wasn't trying to catch up. Aye, of course you weren't. What do you know about sprains anyway? I was almost a doctor once. Small world. Are you a doctor, then? So what's your excuse? Excuse? For runnin' like the devil's chasing you. My excuse-- I'm trainin'. Training for what? For a race around the world. Impressive, I know. So your excuse better be good, brother. Just trying to work a few things out. Aha. A girl, right? A patient. Ah, but a girl patient. What's her name? Her name's Sara. What did you do to her, then? Do to her? You must've done something worthy of this self-flagellation. I told her... I made a promise I couldn't keep. I told her I'd fix her and... couldn't. I failed. Well... right. Just one thing... what if you did fix her? I didn't. But what if you did? You don't know what you're talking about, man. I don't? Why not? Because with her situation, that would be a miracle, brother. Ah. And you don't believe in miracles? Right. Well, then I'm going to give you some advice anyway. You have to lift it up. Lift it up? Your ankle. You gotta keep it elevated. Well, it's been nice chattin'. Jack. Jack. I'm Desmond. Well, good luck, brother. See you in another life, yeah? I wouldn't do that. Where's Kate? What the hell did you-- Am I alive? Yeah. Yeah, you're alive. You smell. Well, thank you. Wow, you really smell. Yeah, I, uh...I went for a run. You smell like you ran far. Well, I showered. I mean, I guess I just didn't cool. I wanted to get back down here and check on you. It was a tour de stade. What? It's when you run all the steps in every section of the stadium up and down. Why would you do that? Um, I'm intense. Did you finish? No. I hurt my ankle. That sucks for you. Is Kevin here? My fiancé? I didn't see him. I'm sure he'll be back... Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Gonna tell me how it went? Sara, the damage to your back was extensive. I did everything that I could, but your spinal column-- I just... I couldn't repair it. You're gonna be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of your life. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Sara. You're yanking my chain, right? No. Then how come I can wiggle my toes? Can you feel this? Yes. Can you feel this? Yes. This? Yes! This? Yes. Move, and I'll kill him. Put the gun down. Where's Kate? Jack, it's okay. - I said drop it! - Where's Kate?! - She's fine. Just put down-- - I'm not putting down anything. Do you want him to die? Put it down! Is this what you were talking about, Locke? Is this your destiny? - All roads lead here.
