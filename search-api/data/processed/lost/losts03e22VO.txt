Can I get another one of those, please? I'm sorry, sir. We'll be landing in 20 minutes. Well, 20 minutes is a long time. How about a newspaper instead? And if you could buckle your seat belt, sir... Sorry about the bumps, folks. We're just hitting a little warm air as we make our descent into Los Angeles.</i> Please keep those seat belts fastened, and we'll have you on the ground shortly.</i> It's me. I... I just read... Forgive me. Mom! Mom! Help! You have everything you need? No, but I made the best out of what we have. Bernard and Jin? They're both excellent shots and highly motivated. The dynamite's in place. We won't miss. No matter what happens here, I want you to keep moving. Keep moving for that radio tower. Don't turn back for any reason. I'm willing to give my life if it means securing rescue, but I'm not giving it up for nothing. You understand? I understand. Then good luck. You, too. If I told you that I'd help you with your "S.O.S." sign, would you change your mind? No, ma'am. I want you to say it again. Say it, Bernard. I am a dentist. I am not Rambo. And don't you forget it. Charlie's gonna be fine. Yeah. Of course he is. Because... we have... to go... home. Alright. Let's do it. Subtitles: swsub.com - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. What did you do for a living before you became Moses? I was a doctor. Right. 'course you were. Well, I need your attention for a minute, doctor. Is she okay? Why wouldn't she be? Because none of your people trusts her. No offense. Why don't you catch up to me when you're done? It's fine. So I need to show you how this wonderful gadget works in case anything happens to me. You need to be able to call my boat. Okay. Show me. It's actually simple. Turn her on here. This opens a direct channel to the freighter. Give her a tap here. Wait for the beep and say hello. - That's it? - That's it. Once the rock star turns off whatever underwater contraption is jamming us up, this red light will turn a lovely shade of green. That'll be any time now, yeah? Hopefully. Who are you? If you tell us how you got down here, we won't hurt you. I came in my invisible submarine. Don't you see it? - Take it easy. - Take it easy? He's one of them. Why are you here? How did you find out about this station? Juliet told us. She's one of us now... In case you haven't heard. We gotta call Ben. Let's call Ben. Come on. You're inside a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light above a switch. You flick the switch. Light goes off. And you drown. It's Bonnie. Ben, are you there? Can you hear me? Why are you breaking radio silence? One of them's down here. I'm sorry. What? We've got him tied up, but he's here. One of them swam down here. Who? Which one? He won't tell us. It's Charlie! Tell him I said hi! How did... How does he know about the station. He said Juliet told them. All right, sit tight. Don't do anything. I'm sending help. You need to go down to the Looking Glass and find out what Charlie Pace is doing down there. You told us the Looking Glass was inoperable... flooded. I lied. Mikhail, I need you to go now! I can be there by dawn. But if Juliet told them about the Looking Glass, what else did she tell them? Ryan, come in. Ryan, are you there? Are your walkies all off? Yes, sir. Did you get a good look? The tents are marked with white coral ... three of 'em. Juliet did her job. Alright. Let's do this. It's empty! Get away from the tent! - It's a trap! Move! - Please, God. Move, move! The tree line! I got your man! Drop your weapons! I got your man! It's over! Don't. Finger off the trigger. There were supposed to be three explosions. It didn't work. There you go. Good as new. Thanks. The news people are waiting for you outside, you being a hero and all. Right. The woman... how is she? She's been stabilized. Thank God you were on that bridge. - Sorry. - No visitors in E.R. It's okay. She's... We used to be married. Come on in. What happened? There was... a car accident. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Were you drinking again? - Are you, Jack? - No. Why did you come down here, Sarah? I'm still listed as your emergency contact. What were you doing driving around at 2:00 in the morning? Maybe you could give me a lift home? I don't think that would be appropriate. Well... Thanks for coming down, Sarah. Good-bye, Jack. Why were there only two explosions? Maybe they didn't have to blow the 3rd tent. But those gunshots... What was that about? - He's okay. - Do you believe that? Listen, they had no idea that we were waiting for them, and Sayid's with your husbands. They're gonna be fine, and they're gonna be a couple hours behind us. We should wait for them here. You go... No. No one gets left behind. If you say, "live together, die alone" to me, I'm gonna punch you in your face. Fair enough, Rose. Fair enough. But we have a plan! And for all we know, it worked. It's gonna be okay. Everything is gonna be all right. Let's just keep moving, okay? It's okay. Let's go. I'm gonna ask you this one more time. Why are you here? I'm here... to turn off your jamming equipment. In there, next to the flashing yellow light. - Now how'd you know about that? - I know because I know. Whatever you ladies do to me, I'm going to turn it off. - You are, huh? - Most definitely am. So what's the code? What? If you're gonna turn off the jamming equipment, you're gonna need the code, and only three people know it. Me, her and Ben. Well... Guess I won't need the code... Since this entire station's gonna be flooded anyway. Now just turn off your little jammer, and the helicopters come and rescue all my friends. But if this station floods, what happens to you? I die. - What? - They're all dead… Diane, Ivan. All of them… dead. It's Shephard and his people… They're gone!</i> Gone? Gone where? I don't know. Did you hear me? They killed seven of us! Calm down and tell him the good news. What good news? We caught three of them... The ones that stayed behind to blow up the tents. They knew we were coming. It was Juliet. She betrayed us. - What? - Just figure out where she is,Tom. Get up. Okay, junior, where the hell did... They're not talking. Who do you have? Jarrah, Kwon and the dentist. Shoot Kwon. - What? - You want them to answer questions, kill Kwon. Do it now! I don't know what that means, but I'm sure it's lovely. No, wait, no... - No talk. - No, please. Talk to me. Nobody will get hurt. Now tell me where your people went. He's lying. He's going to kill us all. Where are they? The radio tower. They're hiking to a radio tower. Why in the hell are they going there? A woman parachuted here. She has a satellite phone, and they're gonna call her ship. Juliet thought we were coming tomorrow, so why were they waiting for us tonight? You heard him. How'd you know? A kid told us. He came in a canoe and warned us.</i> What kid? Karl. He said his name was Karl. You heard that, Ben? I heard. What do you want us to do? Kill them? No. Not yet. We're going to the radio tower? Not we, Richard. Me. You're going to take everyone to the temple as planned. Now might not be the best time to go tromping off on your own. Really? And why not? Because people are asking questions, about leaving home, about what happened to Locke, about Jacob. Not to mention the rapidly spreading rumor that everyone who went down to the beach is dead. They're not all dead. Where are you going? - I asked where you were going. - Well, I thought I might go for a walk, see if I can't find Jack and all his friends. I'm coming with you. Alright. - What? - I said alright. In fact, I think it's a good idea. I mean, you do wanna see Karl again, don't you? Get your pack. I'm leaving in ten minutes. There're 40 of them, and you're alone. They're gonna do whatever it takes to get off the island. What do you think is gonna happen when you get there? I'm gonna talk them out of it. Something's wrong. Lots of things are wrong. Jin, Bernard, Sayid... They should've caught up to us by now. I wanna go back to make sure - they're all right. - 'course you do. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means, Kate, there's always someone to go back for. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. - Nothing? - I'm fine. Why don't you just tell me what happened? - What'd you do that for? - To wake you up. Ever since you got that tape from Lock, it's like you've been sleepwalking. You don't care about our friends, fine, but it's like you don't care about anything anymore. And since when did you start calling me "Kate"? You know... They sent Juliet to check out Sun. But she was there to check and see if I'm pregnant, too. Well, let's hope you're not. That light still red? Bloody hell. You all right? Not for long if you don't get out of here. You have to hide. There's people in there. Quick, hide, hide! Who's he talking to? Who were you talking to? Wasn't talking to anyone. I was just singing. Shut up. Right, okay. You got it. Come on. Can I help you? Just checking her chart. I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Hamill... Rob. The new chief of surgery. I don't think we've met yet. Dr. Shephard, the hero... Twice over. You all right? After last night, I'm surprised you'd even wanna come in. Talk about right place, right time, huh? This woman is very lucky you were there. If she was lucky, she wouldn't have a fractured back that was impinging upon her spinal cord. I'd like to... operate first thing in the morning. You wanna operate? Yes. I'm sorry, but this isn't your patient, and we are well aware of the issues. Gary Nadler's doing the surgery at 6:00 a.m. With all due respect... Dr. Hamill, I'd rather do it myself. Last night, you pulled this woman's 8-year-old son out of a flaming car, then you went back for her. I think you've done enough. I wanna do the surgery. Look, everything's under control here. She'll be fine. Go home. Have a drink. You deserve it. The chart, please. You call me. I wanna know what happens. ... was shut down for several hours in the wake of a fiery car accident that left two injured.</i> An unidentified 40-year-old woman and her son.</i> Fortunately for the two of them, Dr. Jack Shephard was near the scene of the crash</i> and pulled both victims from the burning wreckage</i> and treated them at the scene until paramedics arrived.</i> The victims were later transported to St. Sebastian hospital.</i> Further details of their conditions have not yet been released.</i> I'm going back. - What? - I'm going back to the beach. No way. We keep moving. I ain't asking permission. Look, you got a job to do here. I ain't gonna stand in your way of doing it, but you sure as hell don't need me. What do you think you're gonna get done, alone and unarmed? He won't be alone. I'll go with him. 20 mins ago, you weren't even interested in going, and now all of a sudden - you're telling Jack... - I didn't wanna go with you. It's a suicide mission without guns. I know where there are some guns. There's a hidden cache a couple of miles from here. I can take us back to the beach on a route past it. Juliet, you don't have to do that. Yeah, Jack, I kinda do. Let's do this. Don't do anything stupid. I won't if you won't. Don't wait up. I told you to shut up! You know how you get a tune stuck in your head? This song... It just started coming to me. It's almost finished. Just need to find the bridge. Get the speargun. - What? Why? - 'Cause I want it to hurt. - No, Ben said we... - You don't wanna get it? I will. No. I'll... I'll shut up! I thought you two were on assignment in Canada. He made us promise not to tell anyone. - Hello again. - Where is the other one? - What? - This idiot swam down from a boat. I was just shooting at his friend. He dove down here. - He's alone. - Are you sure about that? Here's a better question to ask, Cyclops. Why did your little friend Ben tell you people that this entire station was flooded when it isn't? Or, why these two have been jamming transmissions off the island? What? Is that true? - That's Ben. - I'll get it. You have to understand. Everything I did, I did for the island. The island told you it was necessary for you to jam your own people? Yes, it did. You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail. Now I'm asking you to trust me, to trust Jacob who told me to do that. Why would Jacob ask you to lie to your own people? Because this island is under assault by forces stronger than anything it's had to deal with in many, many years, and we are meant to protect it, by any means necessary. The jamming was for everyone's security. We are in a serious situation here. So why not trust me? I made a mistake. I should have told you, and I apologize. Mikhail, are you still there? Yes. I need you to help me. I need you to help me clean up this mess that I've made. I need you to kill Charlie. Make sure that the jamming mechanism continues to function at all cost.</i> And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie telling the others what we've done, so you'll have to take care of them, too. How do I know you didn't say the same thing to them about me? Because if I had, Mikhail... you'd already be dead. Out of those polar bear cages and put us on the chain gang, what the hell did you have us breaking all those rocks for, anyway? We were building a runway. A runway? For what? The aliens. I don't know what for. Do you think they told me everything? Yeah, yeah, whatever you say. So you screwing Jack yet? No. Are you? How far away are these guns? There aren't any guns. What? - I lied. - You lied. It was the only way he'd let us go back. So why are you going back? Karma. Why are you going back, James? Hey, guys! Wait up! What the hell do you want? I'm coming with you guys. No way. Not a chance. Come on. I can help. They're my friends, too, man. Charlie wouldn't let me go with him, and Jack's too busy leading to even talk to me. I just wanna help. Please? For God sakes, Hugo, look at you! You're just gonna get in the way. You wanna get us killed? Come on. If we head north, we should get to them before they reach the tower. Why did you let me come? I let you come because I'm delivering you to your new family. I let you come because you betrayed me. You locked Karl in a cage. You put him in a room and tried to brainwash him. I didn't want him to get you pregnant. I suppose I overreacted. We'd better get going. Why do you have to stop them? Why won't you just let them leave? Because I can't, Alex. Don't, John. Put the gun down. Walt? Now get up, John. He shot me, and I can't... move my legs. You can move your legs.
