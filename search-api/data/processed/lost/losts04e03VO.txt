and trust me, when they do We had better be far away from here. If you want to live,you need to come with me. Who are you? Daniel faraday. I'm here to rescue you. so this is the team? These are the wrong people for a mission like this. None of them have field experience,military training. You can't just drop them in unprotected. There's only so much I can do. Where's the chopper? where did it crash?  crash? what kind of pilot you think I am? I put her down safe and sound right over there. Get up. you're coming with us. well, we need to stay where we are so that they can find us. See,there's your problem. we don't want to be found. You wanted to know why we're here? I'll tell you why we're here. we're here for benjamin linus. Now where is he? Did ben ever mention anything About knowing anyone off the island? You're sure of that? no. Look,this is real simple. Do you know where he is or don't you? What do you want with him? I wanna locate him. The people who hired me told me his name's benjamin linus. They gave this picture,and that's all they told me. They said,"find him." and for what they're paying me, I don't need to know anything else. Do you? You want ben? Okay,he's with locke and your friend... -Charlotte  -Charlotte Charlotte. charlotte. Locke's got her,too,and we know where he's heading. Locke's the guy that killed naomi? Give me back my gun,shephard. You want your gun back. I want answers. You don't trust me. I don't trust you. In fact,you're supposed to be dead. But am I asking a billion questions? no. We both have the same problem-- this locke guy. Even if locke has your friend, You can't just waltz in there and grab her. They're armed. Well,how about that? so are we. So why don't we move out and-- You're not going anywhere. will that helicopter fly? What she does. Then you can take me to your ship. sayid,wait a second. We did call these people to get us off this island, Didn't we? Well? I burned a lot of fuel coming in. I can't carry much weight. I'll take three of ya. In case you zoned out while you were tweezing your goatee, One of these yahoos took charlotte prisoner. I can bring her back safely. And if I do... Will you take me to the ship? Absolutely. You bring charlotte back safe, And I will take you off this island. Good morning. Morning. It's a long walk to the next hole. Do you need a ride? Thank you,but no. my ball is right here. You know, You're the first person I've seen out here all morning. I believe we're paying quite a premium For that kind of privacy. Indeed we are. Is this your first time in the seychelles? Unh-unh. I'd use the 5-iron. I think I'll stick with the 7. Tell you what. 50 euros says mine goes closer to the pin with a 5. Let's make it 100. Eccellente. Amazing,huh, How a wager makes just about anything more fun? Not bad. Not bad. So... What do you do for a living,my friend? I do nothing. "nothing" doesn't pay for a vacation here. I was the recipient of a large settlement. Corporate merger? Actually,a plane crash. Oceanic airlines flight 815. I'm sayid jarrah. One of the oceanic six. Ah,that's... That's--that's amazing. uh... I remember reading all about it. Take your shot,my friend. It appears you were right about the 5 iron. Enjoy you round,and,uh,don't worry about the wager. It's all in good fun. No,you won. allow me to pay you. It's fine,thank you. it's... I insist,mr. avellino. "is it free?" was the full extent of my german. What are you looking for? I love europe. everyone speaks english. I'm looking for potsdamer platz. Well,you don't need a map. It's one block down,right across the street. Thank you. I'm elsa. Sayid Sayid. Could I have an espresso,please? What sort of business brings you to berlin? I'm a headhunter. A corporate recruiter. My employer is an economist. he works in emerging markets. Actually,i-i don't really understand what he does, Which doesn't matter since all I do is shop for him. And if this goes off, I'm at his side instantly, Which is wonderful Since he's only in berlin once or twice a year. Which is why you're enjoying A luxuriously long midday coffee. Yes. Thank you. Do i... Know you from somewhere? I'll tell you exactly where you know me from... If you let me take you to dinner. This is the restaurant you're taking me to tonight. 8:00. Well... if you can find it. Hello? I made contact. Good. Take a look at this. Naomi had it with her. She was looking for desmond. Whatever their real agenda is, It's clear they're not sharing it. Maybe desmond can shed some light on this. How long would it take to get to the beach and back? Couple of hours. You mind? Anything I can do to help. Sayid Sayid. So how we gonna do this? You're not the best candidate for this kind of mission. Well,and what kind of mission is that? I'm going to make locke release charlotte, And I'm going to do it without any bloodshed. As opposed to the way I'd do it? The last time you encountered him, You put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. That's not good diplomacy. Hey. jarrah. You think you're going after charlotte without me? Of course not. Well,good. Is there anything else? Yeah. give me my gun back. We leave in ten minutes. Ready to give us a name,gizmo? He's not gonna tell you who his spy is on their boat,james. Yeah? why not? Because that's the only thing that's keeping him alive. Well,here's an idea. Why don't we take a gun,point it to his big toe And send that little piggy to market? And if he still doesn't want to tell us, We'll move on to the roast beef. now why don't we do that? Because then we'd have to carry him. Hey,john,how much further is it? i-i need to feed aaron. It should be here... the cabin. Maybe we got turned around. it could be anywhere. No,it was here. Well,what's in this cabin that's so important anyway? John's looking for somebody to tell him what to do next. I guess I was mistaken. It doesn't... doesn't matter. Plan's the same. we keep movin'. the barracks aren't far. If her team is with jack's group, They know we're going to the barracks. Yeah,and red here was wearing a vest. Which means her posse's gonna come Expecting themselves a gunfight. if all they want is her, maybe we should just let her go. I mean,i thought we were just gonna go hide. Why do we need to take prisoners? We're keeping her because she's gonna be valuable. how is she gonna be valuable? He means as a hostage,luv. Unh-unh. no,this is not what I signed up for. What did you sign up for,hugo? look,i'm just saying I think we-- If we let her go,they'll look at it as a sign of good faith. They'll look at it as an act of foolishness, Which is what it would be. I'm just trying to come up with some sort of compromise-- We're beyond compromise. And right now,hugo,i'm making the decision. Is that gonna be a problem for you? Kinda sucks,huh? what's that? Being told not to come along. Now you know what it feels like to be me. Does that mean I should wait 20 minutes and ago anyway? touch? You should go with them,kate. you're serious? yeah. What,don't you trust sayid? I don't trust locke. So what's preventing him from doing to me What he did to naomi? Sawyer won't let him. Got room for one more? Oh,yeah,she gets a gun. The gun's a last resort,kate You give locke that same speech? Hey! let's move out. This guy sayid-- where's he from? iraq. iraq. So he's just gonna go and work everything out? What was he,a diplomat? no. No,he was a torturer. Naomi-- were you close to her? Nope. met her on the boat. You don't seem particularly affected by her death. Sure I'm affected. she was hot,and I dug her accent. nice. And this woman--charlotte. You don't really care about her,do you? define "care." So much for camaraderie. Yeah,gee,who's the one going after One of their crash buddies with guns? Actually,i do care about locke. Maybe you can tell me How he managed to split your happy little family in half. There was a fundamental debate As to whether your people were coming to rescue us or kill us. And which side did you land on? I'll let you know when I decide. You look fantastic. This is why I wanted to take you to the opera. If a man can't wear his tuxedo by the fifth date,why bother? you know what? I'm not bringing it. If tonight's the night he calls, so be it. i'll carry it. If he does call,i don't want you fired over me. You should tell your employer that there is newer technology. Well,i've tried. he's very old-fashioned. You know how bosses can be. Do you have a boss? Everyone has a boss,elsa. Come on. we don't want to be late. Why are you still here? I mean,when we met, You said you would only be in berlin for one week. The job I'm on is proving harder to accomplish than I thought. oh. right. I was hoping it was because of me. Let's go. Strauss awaits. What's his story? Daniel? ah,couldn't tell you. Half the stuff he says is way over my head. The other half goes way,way over. Hey,uh,frank? can i,uh-- ooh. sorry to interrupt. May I please use the phone just for a second? for what? I just wanna call regina on the boat, Cause I figure since we're waiting, Maybe I could just,you know,try to-- what is it,daniel? I'd just like to do an experiment. just--just a-- Okay. you just keep it to that science stuff,all right? yeah. If minkowski gets on there, you hang up right away. yeah. thank you. thank you. Hello? Regina? hey--hi,it's dan. hang on. Can you hear me? yeah. Yeah? okay. hang on. I'm,uh,all... yes. I am all set here. I have a fix. are you locked in? Getting your signal pretty clear. Oh. okay,great. then... okay. Fire the payload. Payload away! Don't sweat it. He does this kind of stuff on the boat all the time. 40 kilometers to beacon. 30 kilometers to beacon. 20 kilometers to beacon. 10 kilometers to beacon. Regina Regina? I don't have it. That's... weird. That is far more than weird. What's with the swing set? these people have day care? You think they're here yet? Let's find out. It's coming from in there. Let me go! help me! Hurley,what happened? They left me. Locke's gone off the reservation,man. I mean,he took this one chick hostage, He said walt was the one Who told him to kill the other chick,and he-- walt? Dude,don't ask. I was,like,just trying to argue with him So he would just,like,you know,chill,but, uh-- how about you stop babbling, Just tell us what happened to them? where are they? who are you? Where the hell did they go,tubby? Oh,awesome. the ship sent us another sawyer. Hurley,where did they go? L-look,i guess they were too busy tying me up to tell me. I don't know. and so they all left,all together? Yeah,they were freaked. locke said that the people on the ship Were coming to rescue charlotte and then to kill us. So... are you? Not yet. Did they say anything That suggested where they were going next? Uh,locke said they were Gonna go by ben's house before they took off. Why would he go there? for all I know, They could've locked ben up in the closet,too. where's ben's house? Mind if I ask you a question? Shoot. The red sox really win the series? Hey,don't get me started on that,all right? My dad's from the bronx. I bleed yankee blue. I can't believe It's been a hundred days since I've seen a game. It's the payload. It's finally here. What is that? It's a rocket. Oh,no. This is not good. Your friends are back. Look at that. Look for anything that might show where they've gone. I'll start in here. Sayid! Sayid! Don't worry. kate's fine. Good job,hugo. Sorry,dude. I'm sorry,sayid. nothing personal. Where's locke? Talking to that angry chinese guy. I'm not going to hurt you,hurley. Yeah... I saw you snap that guy's neck With that break-dancing thing you do with your legs. I think I'll hang back here. Well... I guess they're running out of jail space I lost a dollar,you know. How'd you manage that? I bet john that you wouldn't be stupid enough To fall for your friend as bait. What do you know about friendship? I know it's no use having friends you can't trust. So what I'm your prisoner? If that sorta thing turns you on. What are you doing here with locke? I'm not with him. yeah,you are,james. Then what are you doing with jack? I went with jack because I believe He can get us off this island. Then I guess that's the difference between us. I ain't lookin' to leave. Why not? Cause I ain't got nothin' back there for me. And what's here that's so much better? Why do you wanna go back,kate? Seem to recall you being shuttled off to jail Before we landed here. So if you think there's anything waitin' for you back home Other than handcuffs, Then you really don't know how the world works. Look around us,freckles. We got roofs over our heads... Electricity,showers,beds. How long,sawyer? How long do you think we can play house? Why don't we find out? Iced tea. I thought you might be thirsty. I'm thirsty. I'm sorry about all the theatrics, But,uh,i didn't know how many of you there would be Or whether you'd be armed. I had to... cover my bases. What have you done with miles and kate? Kate's with sawyer,and miles is somewhere else. He's fine. all I did was ask him some questions. Did he answer any? no. Did you have more luck with the woman you captured? Not particularly. Then why don't you turn her over to me? and why would I do that? I agree that these people are liars. And they're certainly not here to rescue us. But if I return safely with charlotte, They'll take me to their ship. It's our best chance at finding out who they are And what they really want. Well,then,i can save you a lot of trouble,sayid, Because ben says he's got a spy on the boat. Who? It's a secret. Forgive me,but the day I start trusting him Is the day I would have sold my soul. Give me charlotte, Allow me to do things my way, Or a war is coming which we will both be powerless to stop. Why would I give you charlotte for nothing? Oh,i think you misunderstood me. I never expected you to give her to me for nothing. Should we get dressed? No Well  we're gonna have to get out of this bed At a certain point Why? Well,for one thing, Because I know that eventually You're gonna have to go to that job of yours. You know,the one you never talk about. There's nothing to talk about. it's just a job. I know nothing about you. I understand you don't want to talk about the crash, What happened to you. But what about life now? What about you? That's what you do when you're in love,right? In love? Yeah. Okay. No more secrets. What do you want to know? He's here... My boss. I,uh... I have to go. now? Where? Hotel adlon. Where's my dress? Elsa? Elsa? You have to leave berlin. What? You can't be here anymore. What do you mean? why would i-- People will be asking questions soon About what happened to your employer. And you can't be around to answer them. My employer? This... this is about my boss? Who are you? It has nothing to do with how-- the cafe... You meant to meet me there? You used me to get to my boss? What did you say--people will ask what happened to him? it's best you don't know. Are you gonna kill him? You're gonna kill him? Do you even know him? His name is on a list. A list?! what list? you--you have a list? my employer's. Who is that? it doesn't matter who he is! So you just kill people 'cause they're on a list? Innocent people? the man you are working for is not an economist. You were supposed to page me at ten-thirty. No, I didn't kill him. He's not going to give up the name now. Why should I keep him alive? No. He had no idea. All right, all right. I'll bring him to you. Leave the hotel. I'll meet you at the safe house. What do you think you're-- Hey,i'm gonna ask you one last time. Why was naomi carrying this picture of me? Look,man,you gotta understand something. She was senior management. It's not like we hung around the cafeteria together. She stayed on her own-- look, naomi told me you people were hired by her. So you look me right in the eye And tell me you've never seen or heard of penelope widmore. Fine. You don't want to tell me the truth? I'll find someone who will. See,when that takes off,i'm on it. He's back. Where's kate? She decided to stay. What happened to miles? I traded him. traded him? I promised you charlotte. here she is. You cheated. Did i? yes,you did. Lucky for you,that guy's nothing but a pain in my ass. You all right? All right,that gives us room for one more. Charlotte? Go back,with all the fun I'm having here? No. I've got work to do. Seat's your if you want it,daniel. I--no,thank you. I think I should probably just stay with charlotte. All right. Hey,frank. Frank£¿ Frank? Just--just... just one thing. Just be sure That you follow The same exact bearing that we came in on,okay? No matter what. By that,i mean no matter what. just... stay on it. Roger that. Okay. Be careful. I don't have to talk you out of coming. As much as I like helicopter rides, I think you got this one under control. Wish me luck. Good luck. Send me a postcard. You said we have room for one more? Yeah. why? You should bring naomi home. Take your shirt off. Is she dead? Yes. Why didn't she kill you? She was trying to get information from me. What sort of information? She wanted to know who I worked for. She wanted to know about you. Of course she did. Are you crying because it hurts, Or because you were stupid enough to care for her? These people don't deserve our sympathies. Need I remind you what they did The last time you thought with your heart instead of your gun? You used that to recruit me to killing for you. Do you wanna protect your friends or not,sayid?
