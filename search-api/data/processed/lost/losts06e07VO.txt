Why is my name written down on this thing? He didn't tell me. What does he want from me? I had to get you and Jake As far away from that temple as I possibly could. What? Why? 'cause someone's coming there. Someone bad. take cover! Aah! There's still time. Not for me. Whoa! Oh! Where's jarrah? I'm fine. Thank you. Where is he?! Considering that he just killed dogen, I don't think he's gonna be joining us. Who's dogen? The guy in charge of the temple. Sayid killed the interpreter, too. Are you sure? He was standing over their dead bodies Holding a bloody dagger, so, yeah, I'm pretty sure. You said we were safe at the temple. That's what I was told. Well, what about the beach? What beach? Where we buried locke, where they lived. At least we'll have the water at our backs, And it's familiar territory. Anybody else got a better idea? No. The beach it is. That way. Move. ...And it was on this island that everything changed, That everything finally became clear-- Elba... Is where napoleon faced his greatest task. Because exile wasn't the worst of his fate. What was truly devastating to him was the loss of his power. Sure, they allowed him to keep the title of emperor. But without any power, it was meaningless. He mightust as well have bn dead. All right,emember, five and six tomorrow. Thank you. Principal reynolds. Good morning. Walk with me. Linus, there's been a slight schedule shift. I'm going to need you to supervise detention After school today. What? In fact, all week. Cutbacks, budget crises, events above your pay grade. Needless to say, some of us have to pull double duty. But we have history club today. Those kids need me-- there are five students in history club, linus. They'll live. Shouldn't we be encouraging the ones with ambition? Spare me. The club isn't for them. It's for you. It makes you feel needed. Unfortunately for now, you're needed in detention. Thanks for your understanding, linus. It's dr. Linus, actually. oh, for the love of... It's ruined! It's ruined! Ohh! Oh, formaldehyde. For-- formaldehyde's the problem. You know what gets out formaldehyde? Nothin'. Maybe if I had some frickin' lab aprons, I wouldn't have to pay for our incompetent students With another trip to marshalls. Budget cutbacks. How hard would it be for reynolds To spread around a little of the love to the sciences? You know. I'm dealing with lab equipment in there From the 1950s. Now why is that? Principal reynolds is an administrator. He's not a teacher. He's forgotten what The public school system is about. yeah, summers off in exchange for a crap pension. I'm happy to remind him. No, taking care of the kids. That's what's important. Okay. You just keep dreamin'. Oh, I know you've given up, but... I refuse to. maybe you should be the principal. So says the substitute. What do you mean, I should be the principal? It just sounds like you care about this place. And if the man in charge doesn't, Then maybe it's time for a change. I appreciate the sentiment, but who's gonna listen to me? I'm listenin'. How about you tell me what that thing back there was? That thing's what killed her friends back at the statue. And jacob, right? It killed jacob, too. Yeah, of course. And jacob. Of course. You're miles, right? Miles straume? You communicate with the dead. not technically. I... I can tell you how someone died, Pick up their last thoughts before they check out, But I need to be near their bodies. This is what's left of jacob's body. So tell me, miles, how did he die? Linus killed him. What? That's not true. Are you sure? Well, he was standing over jacob's dead body With a bloody dagger, so... Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Thank you. Jacob was the closest thing I ever had to a father. Uh-oh. I'm gonna look for some tools And get to work on some shelter. The rest of you, see what food's left, maybe get a fire going. Yeah, a fire'll fix everything. Is there anything you'd like me to do? You know, psychics- totally unreliable. Miles actually tried to blackmail me once into... You make friends easy, don't ya? ah. Ah. and on top of that, they'll have to convert On a 2-point conversion to make it a tie game. I made you one of the turkey meals With the cranberry sauce that you like. It ain't one of them "Lean" Deals, is it? No. Dad. It's organic. I'm trying to keep you healthy. Well, it's a little too late for that. How was work? I have a doctorate in modern european history... And yet I'm babysitting burnouts in detention. Detention, huh? And the worst of it is, As I look out at those ingrates That I'm tasked with watching... I can't help thinking... That maybe I'm more a loser than any of them. This isn't the life I wanted for you, ben. I wanted so much more. I know. That's why I signed up for that damn dharma initiative And took you to the island, and... They were decent people... smarter than I'll ever be. Imagine how different our lives would've been If we'd stayed. Yes, we'd have both lived happily ever after. No, I'm serious, ben. Who knows what you would've become. Now does that feel better? yes. thank you. Alex? Dr. Linus. Where were you today? We had to cancel history club. oh, I'm so sorry. I should've put a note on the door. The club meetings have to be postponed. I'm in detention all week. Oh, yeah? What'd you do? principal reynolds needs me to cover, so... A.P. Test this Friday. I was... Kinda counting on the tutoring. All right, how about this? Morrow morning, 7:00 a. M. In the library. And you bring the coffee. Thanks. God, you're the best, dr. Linus. My pleasure, alex. Okay. See you. Excuse me. How long are we going to stay here? I told you. I don't know yet. I need to find my husband. Trust me, if anyone wants toind him, it's me. But I don't know where to look. Why do you want to find jin? Because your last name is kwon. So is his. And I don't know whether I'm supposed to protect you, him or both of you. Protect us? What are you talking about? You're candidates... To replace jacob. Replace him? To do what? If you're the one selected, I imagine you'll find out. Wait. You said candidates. How many are there? Six. There are only six left. cheese curds. Hurley. come on. Wake up. Come on. Let's go. We can make the temple by nightfall. I'm hungry. Let's... Eat breakfast first. No, we can eat on the way. what's the rush? You know, maybe we should take our time? Why? Becaus I'm leaving, hurley. You coming or not? Unh-unh, dude. It's this way. No, we came this way. Yeah, but that was a mistake. This is faster. Trust me, it's just around here. It's a shortcut. No, it's not. You're both wrong. Temple's that way. Where did you come from? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. Not yet. If you wanna go to the temple, it's this way. Dude, you trust that guy? At least he's not stalling. When you're finished inhe library, Give me a hand gettin' some more firewood. Just looking for something useful. god. the things people will bring on a trip... "Oceanic." I remember that plane breaking in half Like it was yesterday. You sound nostalgic. Maybe I am. You know, I was supposed to be flying it. Oceanic 815. And why didn't you? I overslept. Come on. Can you believe it? Imagine how different my life would be Had that alarm gone off. How different would it have been? The island still got you in the end, didn't it? Walk. Okay, wait. You don't have to do this if-- stop. On the ground. Face down. What are you doing? Look, if this is about at miles said... Pick it up. What? Pick it up and start digging. Dig what? A grave. For who? You murdered jacob. It's for you. Now you know this. I know you do. Expanded lord cornwallis' powers as governor-general. Very good. Now moving on to the charter act of 1813. At the time of the charter, The east india trading company's power Extended to all of india except for... Uh... I don't know! It's okay. It's okay. It's just a test. Just a test? it's only my entire life, dr. Linus. Alex, I think you're being a bit overdramatic. Am I? My mom works two jobs just to pay our rent. How am I gonna pay for college, let alone yale? Assuming I can even get in. You're one of the brightest students I've ever had. I don't worry about your future at all. Really? Really. Now what can I do to help? I'll write you a great letr of recommendation. I'll-- No, I need someone who went there. Unfortunately, the only one I know Is that pervert, principal reynolds. Excuse me? "Pervert"? Forget I said that. I was just angry. Alex, has incipal reynolds... Done something to you? What? Ew! No, I swear. It's not that. Then what is it? Dr. Linus, if I tell you, Will you promise to keep it between us? Of course I promise. okay. So I was in the nurse's office a few months ago. I had a stomachache, And I just went in to find a cot and I fellsleep. When I woke up after school, In the other room, principal reynolds was there. And the nurse... Well, I guess she forgot I was in there. They were... You know, doing it In the room right next to me, Where they give kids hearing tests. Isn't that totally gross? Totally. Dr. Linus, you're not gonna say something, are you? No, no. A promise is a promise. Well, shall we return to the high seas? Yeah. Sure. Not exactly tearing up on the digging front, are you? I'm not in a big hurry. Brought you some grub. Hope you like green beans and banana, 'cause it's all we got. I'm not really hungry. Suit yourself. Miles, do you remember once you asked me for $3.2 million? Do you still want it? What are you gonna do? You're gonna write me a check on this banana leaf? I can get off this island, and when I do, I have a vast network of people and resources That will get you . All you have to do is cut me loose. Why would I need your money when there are A couple of jabonies under there named nikki and paulo Who got buried alive With $8 million in diamonds on top of them? I can't believe you're just gonna stand by And watch this happen. Ilana's gonna murder me for killing jacob-- A man who didn't even care about being killed. No, he cared. Excuse me? Right up until The second the knife went through his heart, He was hoping he was wrong about you. I guess he wasn't. Dig! So... You're not time traveling? No. But you look the same as you did 30 years ago. How is that possible? Not easy to explain. Is this like a "Terminator" Thing? You a cyborg? No, I'm not a cyborg. Vampire? Jacob gave me a gift. Jacob. What do you know about him? I know he's dead. I thought you said we were going to the temple, dude. I lied. Why? Because everyone at the temple is dead. What do you mean, they're all dead? What happened? I'm--I'm not sure what happened, But... I just came from there, And there's no survivors. What about our friends? Sayid, kate. They--they weren't there. Maybe they made it out alive. All I know is whatever you're lookinfor at the temple-- It's not there. You didn't want to go back there. Did you know about this? Jacob kinda sorta nted at it. You spoke to jacob? Yeah. Well, whatever he said, don't believe him. Where you going? There's something I need to do. To do what? Die. Hey, do you have a minute? Yes, I guess. Might as well just give 'em all f's. Tell me, how hard is it To learn the difference between a genus and a species? what do you want? You're pretty good with computers, aren't you? Something tells me you wouldn't even be standing here If you didn't already know that I was. Could you, hypothetically, Access someone's e-mail account without their knowledge? I--yeah, it depends on the account. Say a faculty account. Hypothetically. Whose? Nurse kondracki. Kim? Why? Do you got the hots for her? No. I'm just... I'm curious about some of her correspondence. With whom? Okay. That's fine. I didn't come to see you. You came to see me. I don't have time to play 20 questions. Now you can either tell me what it is that you're doing, Or you can let me finish grading my papers in peace. All right, all right. I have reason to believe that she might be engaged In an inappropriate personal relationship With principal reynolds. You're making a play. You're going after the big job, aren't you? Are you going to help me or not, leslie? I want a good spot. I'm sorry? I want lamr's spot in the main parking lot-- The one next to the maple tree. Not under the maple tree- next to the maple tree. That way, I get the shade from the maple tree But not all that tree crap all over the hood of my car. And I want aprons. I want lots of aprons. And I want some lab equipment in here That was built in this decade. Is that a deal? Deal. You know, you really had me fooled with that sweater vest. linus, you're a real killer. Been here before? Yes. And in all the time that I've spent on this island, Today is the first time I've ever come back. jack? Dude, where are ya? I'm in here. Do not open that. There's dynamite in there. It's mega-unstable. I know. So did dr. Arzt... Then I was wiping him out of my shirt two days later. Dude, it's time to go. No, not yet. He's opening up a crate of dynamite, And he said he wanted to kill himself. I can't kill myself. What? Even if I wanted to- and trust me, I do-- I-I can't kill myself. Which is why I want you to do it for me. What are you talking about? What I'm talking about, jack, is that... Well, jacob touched me. And when jacob touches you... Well, it's considered a gift. Except it's not a gift at all. It's a curse. Dude! Seriously, let's go now! Why do you want to die? I devoted my life-- Longer than you can possibly imagine-- In service of a man who told me That everything was happening for a reason, That he had a plan-- A plan that I was a part of-- And when the time was right that he'd share it with me. And now that man's gone. So why do I want to die? Because I just found out my entire life had no purpose. Now if I light this myself, it--it won't work. But you can light it for me, jack. I made the fuse long enough so you'll have time to get out. Jack, please tell me you're not actually considering this. If he wants to die, There's nothing we're gonna do to stop him. Thank you. Now... Let's talk. Jack! Dude, we gotta go. Guy's crazy, and I know crazy. Hurley, go ahead. We'll be all right. Dude, you're gonna blow up! Gotta talk to him, hurley. Just go. No, I'm not going without you. Hurley, I'll be fine. If you change your mind, I'll be, like, a mile away. You should go with him, jack. No, richard. No, I shouldn't. Then you're gonna die. actually, I don't think either one of us is gonna die. What makes you think that? I just came from a lighthouse Where my name was etched in wood On a dial that turned a mirror That somehow reflected the image of the house that I grew up in. Jacob's lighthouse. He got hurley to bring me out there Because he wanted me to see what was reflected in that mirror. For some reason, he wanted me to know That he had been watching me ever since I was a kid. Why? I have no idea why. But I'm willing to bet you that if jacob went to that trouble, That he brought me to this island for a reason, And it's not to blow up sitting here with you right now. That's a pretty big risk you're taking, jack. Yes. What if you're wrong? I'm not. Want to try another stick? All right, jack. You seem to have all the answers. So--so now what? We go back to where we started. Hello, ben. what are you doing here? Visiting. What are you doing? Why? Because you talked me into killing jacob. Do you see that woman over there eating a mango? She's his bodyguard, and she knows what I did. So you've got what you wanted because she's going to kill me. I don't want you to die, ben. In fact, I went back to the statue to get you, But you'd already gone. Get me? For what? I'm gathering a group to leave this place for good. But once we're gone, Someone's gonna need to be in charge of the island. Me? I can't think of a better man for the job. Well, it doesn't seem very likely, does it, Under the circumstances? How am I gonna get away from... Come to the other island, to the hydra station. That's where we'll be. She'll come after me. 200 yards inland, there's a tree in the clearing With a rifle leaning up against it. If you go now, you'll get there first And you'll have the drop her. But n't hesitate. She won't. See you soon, ben. Hey! come in. Linus, I don't have time To listen to you complain about detention. That's not why I'm here. I want you to read something. Well, if this some attempt to revive your little club... Those are 30 e-mails that cover a 3-month period. It's pretty lascivious stuff, Which would be fine if it was private, But they seem to describe Acts that took place on schl property-- Acts which, morality aside, I think the school board would frown on, Not to mention your wife. What do you want? You're gonna resign... For, I don't know... Personal reasons, health. Your call. But with your resignation, you're gonna recommend That the school board hire me as your replacement. And the irony of all this Is that they hold you in such esteem That I'll get the job. So... Do we have an understanding? Linus... May I ad you an e-mail? "Dear principal reynolds, "I would appreciate it if you could write "A letter of recommendation to yale on my behalf. "It would mean the world to me. Sincerely, alexandra rousseau." It's a funnyhing about recommendations, linus. They work both ways. So... I put the ball back in your court. You can execute your little machiavellian maneuvers, Go for my job, sit at my desk. But, alas, there will be an unfortunate side efct-- I will torch miss rousseau And her future. Is my job, my power, that important to you? So... What'll it be, dr. Linus? Drop it! Put the gun down! What are you waiting for? I want to explain. Explain what? I want to explain that I know what you're feeling. You have no idea what I'm feeling. I watched my daughter alex die in front of me. and it was my fault. I had a chance to save her, But I chose the island... Over her. All in the name of jacob. I sacrificed everything for him... And he didn't even care. Yeah, I stabbed him. I was... so angr.. confused. I-I was terrified that I was about to lose The only thing that had ever mattered to me-- Myower. But the thing that really mattered... Was already gone. I'm sorry that I killed jacob. I am. And I do not expect you to forgive me Because... I can never forgive myself. Then what do you want? Just... Let me leave. Where will you go? To locke. Why? because he's the only one that'll have me. I'll have you. Dr. Linus. Hello, alex. I was just coming by to thank principal reynolds. He wrote me the most incredible letter of recommendation. Wow. Wonderful. Did you have something to do with it? I mean, I thought he might say some nice things, But he really went all out. No, it wasn't me, alex. But it always say you're a great student. Obviously, I wasn't the only one who noticed. thanks, doctor-- Linus, what the hell are you doing in my office? Just dropping off the detention sign-up sheet for the week, Per your request. Just put it on my desk. So will I see you at history club? Uh, you mean when it's back on? Oh, no, we've got our old slot back. Principal reynolds found someone to cover for detention. Isn't that right? Yes, that's right. Well, then, see you at 4:00. Bye. Hey. Did you do it? No. No? No?! Wait. What--what about my parking space? You can have mine. Do you need a hand? Please help me with the tarp. Sir, there are people on the beach. Should we stop? No. Proceed as planned.
