to do something very important. When do we start? Run. These people are extremely dangerous. We need to go now. Lead the way. This man wants to leave the island, and that plane's the only way he can do it. Do you wanna know where we're going? We're gonna stop him. How are you gonna stop him from getting on that plane? We have to destroy it. In a world of conflict and strife,</i> there is but one fact we all can agree upon...</i> everybody loves Hugo. Born to humble surroundings, Hugo Reyes has always been a beacon of light</i> for all who crossed his path. Hugo's lifelong love affair with chicken</i> led him to acquire and then expand the Mr. Cluck's chain</i> into a worldwide phenomenon. The exponential growth of Hugo's success</i> was startling. But financial success wasn't the end,</i> it was the beginning. Hugo and giving became synonymous... parks... Playgrounds... Hospitals... The Mr. Cluck's house for children.</i> The philanthropy was unparalleled...</i> Which brings us to this evening and the opening of the Hugo Reyes paleontology wing at the golden state natural history museum... a lasting beacon of culture that bears the name of one of our city's greatest benefactors. Ladies and gentlemen, our man of the year... Hugo Reyes! It's a pretty cool trophy, huh? Mm-hmm, Hugo. Oh, you know we got the human fund next Saturday night. Can you make it? Another trophy? Everybody loves Hugo. You know who doesn't? Women. Ma! You need a woman in your life, especially one who has not nursed you. That's disgusting. And I'm too busy to meet someone. You're not too busy. You're too scared. I'm not scared. Good, because you have a date tomorrow. I do? Grandpa tito's neighbor's daughter, Rosalita. She agreed to lunch with you. What's she like? Willing to meet you. Ma. You're going! She's gonna love you. And if she doesn't, we will find someone who does. A lot of crazy stuff's been happening. I kinda wish I could talk to you about it in person. A lot of people have come to talk to me after they've... You know, gone. It would be nice if you could, too. Hugo? You ready to go? Once I'm back, we're leaving. Where you going? "The black rock." If we're gonna destroy that plane, we'll need dynamite. You sure that's the right move? No. But it's the only move we have. Well, you're the expert. Whose grave is this? Her name was Libby. She was in the tail section of the plane. We were gonna have our first date. It was gonna be, like, a picnic. But... Then she was murdered. I'm sorry. Yeah, me, too. Hey. What are you doing here? I'm here to stop you from getting everyone killed. Sync by n17t01 - Resync by honeybunny you gonna say something? Why should I trust you? You murdered Libby and Ana Lucia. That doesn't matter right now. What matters is you going across the island to blow up that plane? People are gonna die... a lot of people, and it's gonna be your fault. What? Because people are listening to you now, Hurley. Hurley. Who are you talking to? Um... No one. Come on. We're leaving. Can I get you some more homemade tortilla chips? Sure. Whatever. Uh, can you leave those? I'm meeting someone. She's running late. Right. Chips are on the way. Hugo? Uh, hi. Nice to meet you. Wow. Uh, I wasn't expecting someone like you. Uh, I'm sorry? You know, someone who's so... Pretty. Please. H-have a seat. You don't look like a Rosalita. Oh. Um, my name isn't Rosalita. I-it's Libby. So... you're not my blind date? No, I-I just saw you from across the room. Well, how'd you know my name? Well, if I tell you, you're gonna think I'm crazy. No, I won't. Hugo, do you believe that two people can be connected, like soul mates? I guess. You don't remember me, do you? Should I? What are you doing, Elizabeth? Are you bothering this man? No. No, he... he's an old friend. Actually, we just... wait. What's... what's going on? I apologize for the intrusion. Come on. No, Dr. Brooks, if I could just... Doctor? I'm sorry. She just wandered off. Wandered off from where? Everything that I said, Hugo, I meant it. Forgive us. Yeah, just four of us. All right, let's go. We have to make it to the outriggers and across the channel to hydra island before nightfall. You have the dynamite? Four sticks... enough to destroy the cockpit and all the instruments. That plane'll never fly. Um, I don't know if that's a good idea. I mean, for one thing, that stuff's really unstable. You have to trust me. I've been training my whole life for this. To blow stuff up? To protect you. Yeah, but how is blowing up the plane protecting us? With that plane gone, that thing won't be able to leave the island.  Yeah, well, neither will we, and then we'll be stuck here with it, and it'll be angry at us. Jacob said Richard would know what to do. And Richard said to blow up the plane. Correct? Yes. Well, Jacob never said anything about it to me. I mean, what if Richard's wrong? Hugo, I'm looking out for your best interests, all of you. Nothing is more important than this. That thing is evil, and God help us if it ever leaves this island, bec... about six feet off the ground. That gonna be a spear? I'm not sure what it's gonna be yet, James. When the time is right, it'll tell me. You talk to wood now? Sawyer. What? Something I can do for you two? Is there something you can do? How about anything? Those bastards on the other island grabbed Jin. We're just sitting around twiddlin' our damn thumbs, doin' nothin' about it. There's a difference between doing nothing and waiting. So what are we waiting for? You were only able to come back to this island because you all did it together. If we're gonna get on that plane and leave, it has to happen the same way. We're waing for your friends to get here, Kate... Hugo, sun, Jack... that's the only way we're ever getting off this godforsaken rock. Well, I don't see that happening. Well, let's just hope you're wrong. Where you been? Can I speak to you in private? Absolutely. Everything go all right? Yes. Did Widmore see you? No, but his people did. And you let them live? I didn't see the point of killing them when I had what I came for. So you found what they were hiding in the submarine? I most certainly did. Now what? We get me dynamite or else she died for nothing. Maybe she died to show us to stay the hell away from dynamite. Well, Jack, that's a risk I'm willing to take. Richard, I promised sun that I'd get her off this island. Well, Jack, I-I wish you hadn't done that. If it makes you feel any better, you can blame it on me. I think Richard's right. It's the only choice we've got. Trust me, Jack. Okay. Good. Let's get moving. 38? Number 38? Mr. Reyes! What an honor. Give me a bucket, family size. Of course. Right away, sir. 41? Number 41? What? I'm sorry. Have I seen you before? I own the place. Maybe you saw my commercial. You want a Clucketeer keychain? N-no. It's not that. Were you on oceanic flight 815? About a week ago, from Sydney? Uh, yeah. So was I. Wow. What a coincidence. Yeah. Listen, you mind if I join you while I wait for my order? Be my guest. Ooh. That is a lot of chicken. I eat when I'm depressed. Ah. So what's her name? I met a girl on a blind date the other night. And you didn't- it didn't go how you'd hoped? Mm. She was totally awesome, expect for one thing- she's crazy. Well, all women are a little bit crazy, brother. No. This one actually lives in the looney bin. I mean, I saw the van. She's full-on nuts. I mean, she started sane, but then she told me that we already knew each other... and that? I'd remember. Tell me something... did you believe her when she said she knew you? Yeah. Kinda. You know, I say go with your gut. You know, maybe you should... You should try to find out where she thinks she knew you from before you give up on her. 42? Order 42? Ah, that's me, brother. Well... Uh... It was nice bumping into you. Hello. Hello. I'm sorry Sayid tied you up, but he was afraid you'd run before we had a chance to talk. I don't blame him. Although as I explained to him before he left, i have nowhere to run to, brother.</i> Well, if that's not the best argument against captivity that I've ever heard, I don't know what is. You mind if I ask you a couple questions, Desmond? Not at all. Why did Charles Widmore bring you back to the island? Considering I was kidnapped, you'd have to ask him. They had him under armed guard. He threw me into a wood shack and blasted me with a massive amount of electromagnetism. If you don't mind my asking, Desmond, how can you be sure what it was that he blasted you with? Experience. Do you know who I am? Of course. You're John Locke. Head back to camp. I'll be back soon. Where are you going? Desmond and I need to take a walk. Something I'd like to show you. Kinda makes you think, doesn't it? What's that? Ilana. There she was, handpicked by Jacob, trained to come and protect you candidates. No sooner does she tell you who you are, then she blows up. The island was done with her. Makes me wonder what's gonna happen when it's done with us. All right, everyone. This might take a few minutes. I don't want anyone but me handling that dynamite, so I'm gonna go in alone. Where's Hugo? I thought he was up front with you. Run! Run! Go! Go! Go! Go! Why the hell did you do that?! I'm protecting us. What the hell were you thinking?! Calm down. Now what... what are we supposed to do now? That's it. That's enough. We're dead. We're all dead. A warning might have been nice there, Hugo. I did say "run." Why'd you do that? Michael told me to. Who? Michael. He's one of the people who come back and yell at me after they die. He told me I had to stop everyone from blowing up the plane. So... no dynamite, no more blowing up. That happen a lot, dead people yelling at you? It happens enough. And you just listen to whatever they say? Dead people are more reliable than alive people. How can I help you, Mr. Reyes? I wanted to ask you about that girl the other day. Libby? I was wondering if maybe I could see her. Well, I don't think that's a good idea. She's not well. Clearly, she's well enough for, like, a... fajita field trip. Well, that's my mistake. I misjudged her condition. Her condition? She has issues with reality. What do you mean? I just think it probably wouldn't be a good idea for you to see her right now. It'll only confuse her. You said "probably," which means you might make an exception. Well, perhaps for family. Or a generous donor? I'm sorry? The rec room looked pretty gnarly on my way in. What do you think 100k might buy? You remembered? No. I'm sorry. Then why are you here? Where is it you think you know me from? Um, I'm not sure. I... I know it won't make sense. Try me. A few days ago, I was watching tv, and one of your commercials came on. And the moment that I saw you, it was like I was hit over the head. All these memories came washing back... of my life, only... it was... Another life. What kind of memories? There was a plane crash. And... I was on an island. And I was there? I think so. We... knew each other. We... Liked each other. And then when I got here, it was almost like I'd been here before. And for some reason, Hugo, I have a memory of you being here, too. Um... This is the first time I've ever been in a mental hospital. Yeah, I know. But I can't get you out of my brain. That's why the other night when I saw you, I had to talk to you, because if you remembered me... I wish I could, Libby, but... I can't. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. I'm crazy. Yeah, probably, but... We all got something, right? I mean, it takes a lot of guts to go up to a total stranger and tell them you know them from some bizarro alternate universe. I'm scared just saying "hi" to a girl. You're doing fine. Hey, can you ever, like... Get outta here? On a day pass or... Yeah. I'm here voluntarily. Well... Would you like to... Do something? You mean... A date? Uh... Yeah. I'd love that. Remind me, Desmond... how long were you down in that hatch, pushing that button? Three years. And here you are, back for more. If I didn't know better, I'd say this island has it in for you. Do you know better? Excuse me? Well, there's nothing special about me, brother. This island has it in for all of us. Yes, it does. What? Who's that? Just ignore him. Do you know that boy? I said ignore him. Where you going? Ben, back at the dharma barracks... there's still grenades there? Explosives? Yes, I think so. Then that's where we're going. Maybe we should talk about this a minute. Talk? There's no time to talk, but if you know what we need to do, if you know how we stop that thing from leaving the island without blowing that plane up, then let's hear it. Let's all hear it. I know what we need to do. Really? What's that? We have to go talk to Locke. Are you trying to get us killed? It's not my idea. It's his. Jacob says we have to talk to Locke. - Jacob's here right now? - Yeah. Ask him what the island is. What? A while back, Jacob told me what the island was, and if he's really standing here right next to me, then just ask him. I don't have to prove anything to you, Richard. You either come with me or you can keep trying to blow stuff up. Your call, dude. He's lying. Jacob isn't telling us what to do because Jacob never tells us what to do.</i> I'm gonna make this simple... if that thing leaves the island, that's it. I-it's over. - What's over? - Everything. I'm destroying that plane, and I can use all the help I can get. Who's coming with me? I am. I saw that thing in action, man. It doesn't want to talk. Sorry. Anyone else? Sorry, Richard. If Jacob says we go talk to Locke, we go talk to Locke. - I'm going with Hugo. - Really? Don't get in our way. All right, Hurley. Let's go talk to Locke. Probably. So what do you think we should... Say to Locke when we get there? I mean... How do you break the ice with the smoke monster? Don't worry about it. Something tells me he's gonna do most of the talking. Or he could just kill us all. Yeah, he could. I didn't see Jacob back there. Uh, I just said it 'cause I wanted everyone to listen to me. I know. Then why'd you come with me? Ever since Juliet died, ever since I got her killed, all I've wanted was to fix it. But I can't. I can't ever fix it. You have no idea how hard it is for me to sit back and listen to other people tell me what I should do. But I think maybe that's the point. Maybe... Maybe I'm supposed to let go. Unless you letting go gets us killed. Going to see Locke was my idea, not Jacob's. Hurley, you asked me to trust you. This is me trusting you. Well, it's a good thing you do, dude, cause... I have no idea where I'm going. Wait. It's cool. I think I know what these things are. Oh, yeah? What the hell are they? Wait here. Hey. You around? Michael? You're stuck on the island, aren't you? Because of what I did. And... There are others out here... Like you, aren't there? That's what the whispers are? Yeah. We're the ones who can't move on. Do you know where Locke is? There. Thanks. Is... Is there anything I can do to help you? Don't get yourself killed. Okay. And, Hurley? If you ever do see Libby again... Tell her I'm very sorry. I'll be sure and do that, dude. I got, like, six different kinds of cheeses. I don't even know what they are, but the lady at the store said they were good, so... I figured you'd like cheese because... Everybody likes cheese. Is something wrong? No, not wrong, just... Off. Have you been here before? No. It's just... being here with you feels so familiar. It's like a date we never had. Wow. I sound completely insane, don't I? No. Not completely. Why do you even wanna be with me? Why you wanna be with me? What? Come on. Look at me. I want to be with you... Because I like you. Yeah, but... You like me because... Well, you're... delusional. What? What's wrong? Whoa. - Dude. - What? I... I think I'm remembering stuff. You are? You mean I'm not crazy? No, I don't think you are. We're here. What is it? It's a well. Let me guess... you're wondering how deep it is. You read my mind. You have any idea how old this well is, Desmond? Very old? That's exactly right. Very old. So old, in fact, that... The people who dug this well did it completely by hand. God knows how long it took 'em. Well, it seems like a lot of work just to get some water. Oh, they weren't looking for water. They were looking for answers. A long time ago, places like the one we're standing at right now made compass needles spin. And the people holding the compasses needed to know why, so they dug. Did they find what they were looking for? No, they didn't. The reason I wanted you to see this, Desmond, is because Charles Widmore is not interested in answers. He's only interested in power. And he brought you back to this island so that you could help him find what he's looking for. After all, this isn't the only well. And that's the reason you wanted me to see this? Why aren't you afraid? Excuse me? You're out here, middle of the jungle, with me. Not a person on earth even knows you're here. Why aren't you afraid? What is the point in being afraid? Aah! How is our friend? We don't have to worry about him anymore. Where you been? I went for a walk, James. Well, now that you've stretched your legs, maybe you can... Son of a bitch. Um... hey. Hello, Hugo. I don't know who you are, dude, or what you want, but we have to talk to you. "We"? There are other people with me. But the thing is, you got weapons, and we got weapons, and I don't want anyone to get hurt... Or killed. So we're not gonna do anything, and I want your word that you're not gonna do anything either. You have my word. Okay, guys. Come on out. Hello, Jack. Hello there. Are you waiting for someone in particular? Excuse me? Well, I noticed you've been parked here a while, watching the kids, and, well, it is a school. Do you have a child who goes here? No. No. I was, um, uh, I just moved to the neighborhood, and... And, uh, I'm looking for a school for my son. What's your son's name? Charlie. Well, as a teacher here, I can vouch for it completely. It's a wonderful school. That's great to hear. Thanks. Well, it was nice talking to you. Have a good day. Oh my God! Call 9-1-1! Do it now! Mr. Locke? Oh, my God. Don't... don't move. We're gonna get you to the hospital.
