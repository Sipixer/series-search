Beyond that field, across the ridge, is the heart of the island. That's where the light is. That's where he's trying to go. And what you have to protect. How long am I gonna have to do this job? As long as you can. Drink this. Now you're like me. - This is the well I threw Desmond Hume into. - Aah! - Looks like someone helped him out. - No, Ben, someone helped me out. I'm gonna find Desmond. And when I do, I'm gonna destroy the island. There was a hit-and-run a few days ago at Washington Tustin High School. - Yeah? - I'm the suspect. Good afternoon. And how are you doing today? Terrific. I think it's time to leave. You're with him, and you're with me. We are going to a concert. Let's go. - Do you need somebody to sign for that? - You work here? I do indeed, brother. You a priest or somethin'? Or something. Do you mind taking it around the back there? Yeah, sure. You got it. Just around there. Thank you. Who died? A man named Christian Shephard. "Christian Shephard"? Seriously? Seriously. Friend of yours? Not exactly. H... hang on a second. You bust me out of jail and make me put on this dress so that we can go to some concert, and you won't even tell me why we're here? No one can tell you why you're here, Kate. - Certainly not me. - You're the one who brought me here. I'm not talking about the church. I'm talking about here. Who are you? What do you want? My name is Desmond Hume. And even though you don't realize it, I'm your friend. And as for what I want... I want to leave. Leave and go where? Let me show you. You okay? Yeah. You? Well, to be honest, doc, I'm kinda wondering what the hell just happened up here. That makes two of us. So you're the new Jacob, huh? Feel any different? Not really. Well, doc, how about you come down off the mountaintop and tell us what the hell the burning bush had to say for itself? Jacob told me that we have to go to the bamboo forest out past our old camp. Just past it, well, he said I'd find the place that we need to protect. This place... what is it? He called it the heart of the island. All he said was that it's... it's a light. And that Locke smoke thing wants to put it out? Something like that, yeah. So what if he does? Then that's it for all of us. But... but if Locke wants to put it out, then why hasn't he? 'Cause he ain't got what he needs. I'm guessing that'd be Desmond. That's where we were headed before your inauguration. Sayid said Locke tossed him in a well. Jacob didn't say anything to me about Desmond. Doesn't sound like he said anything about anything. That's kinda true, dude. He's worse than Yoda. All right, y'all head to your heart of the island, and I'll go get the magic leprechaun out of that well. If we leave a trail, can you catch up with us? - Hell, yeah, I can. - Then be safe. I'd ask you along, but that'd take all the fun - out of me telling you you can't come. - Uh, I guess I'll just have to resist the urge to follow you anyway. I got a bad feeling about this. Syncing cd1 by n17t01 - corrected by chamallow syncing cd2 by honeybunny I don't know why you got me out of prison, what you want or who you are, but you understand I can't be held responsible for... Yeah, yeah, whatever, dude. None of this is ringing a bell, is it? You, me... tranquilizer gun? You are insane. Okay. Fine. I'm insane. Just wait here. What if I don't? Then that's your choice. But if you stick with me... you'll be happy you did. Yeah, yeah, yeah. "Do no disturb" sign. Who are you? Why you grinnin' like a sodding idiot? Uh, you have a concert to perform tonight, and I'm here to pick you up. Didn't I make it clear to Widmore's other monkey? I don't care about a sodding concert. Charlie... Charlie, what if I told you that... playing this show is the most important thing you'll ever do? Would you come then? Sod off. Okay, dude. Sorry about this. What was that? That was Charlie. Why did you take the job, Jack? Because I was supposed to. Why? Because some stranger wrote our names on a wall? I took it because the island's all I've got left. It's the only thing in my life I haven't managed to ruin. You haven't ruined anything. Nothing is irreversible. This would be so sweet if we weren't all about to die. As long as you're watching, why don't you join us? What are you doing here, James? I heard Desmond fell in the well, so I came to help him get out. Looks like somebody beat us both to the punch. Oh, well. Do you know why I'm here? I'm guessing you need Desmond to destroy the island. That's absolutely right. Then what, Smokey? You going down with the ship? Suicide doesn't seem like your style. I'm not going down with anything. But you and the rest of Jacob's little "candidates" absolutely are. We're not candidates anymore. Ohh! Oh! Aah. I'll be seein' ya. You're not gonna go after him? I don't need to. When you said you were gonna destroy the island, I thought you were speaking figuratively. Because I said I'd leave you in charge once I was gone? I'm sorry if I left out the part about the island being on the bottom of the ocean. That being said, you're welcome to join me on my boat. Because once we get Desmond to do what we need him to do, I'm gonna sail away from this godforsaken place and watch it sink. I think there was a dog here. Morning. Morning. Sleep okay? Aye. Your camp's a lot nicer than the bottom of a well. I think I'm gonna go ahead and take that as a compliment. Are you gonna talk his ear off, or you gonna get the man some breakfast? Guess I'll go check the traps for fish. Come on. Vincent. Let's go. So, Rose, tell me... how long have the two of you been living here? Well, we built this place in '75, and... lived here a couple of years, and then the sky lit up again. So God only knows when in the hell we are now. So... Desmond... I don't mean to be rude, but after you eat, I'm gonna ask you to move on. We broke our rule with you. What rule is that? We don't get involved. Whatever got you tossed inside a well... that's the kind of drama Bernard and I don't want to have anything to do with. Fair enough. Looks like you caught something. I'm sorry. Hello, Rose. I'll make this simple. Come with me now or I'll kill them both right in front of you. You don't have to go anywhere with him. I'll make it hurt. I want your word you won't touch them. Ever. Done. Then I'll do what you want. Yes, Desmond. You will. You have any idea where I'm taking you, Desmond? No. But I assume it's a place where there's a very bright light. What makes you say that? Oh... just a hunch. - What was that? - What was what? Linus, can you hear me? Come in. I found Alpert. Linus? Damn it. You okay? What... what... what happened? You thought it'd be a good idea to talk to the black smoke. It responded by throwing you into the damn jungle. Locke. L... - is he still here? - No. Here. I've been trying to get Linus on the walkie. He won't pick up. - Come on. Let's get you some help. - Help? Help? Help from where? You still have the explosives? The... the c-4? Yeah. Why? Because we need to go to the other island and finish what we started. We need to blow up that plane. - Detective Ford. - Jim, it's me. - I think I just saw that Jarrah guy. - You at county lockup? No, I'm at my dad's museum concert benefit thing. Well, it can't be Jarrah. - I just put him in a van to county an hour ago. - Really? - Because I just called, and they said it never showed up. - What? Help me out here, Jim. Jarrah popped four people in cold blood. Only one witness left the scene alive, right? Some Korean woman. Can you make sure she's okay? Yeah, yeah. Sun Paik. Gunshot wound. She's still over at the hospital. Enjoy your concert, Enos. I'll keep her safe. Am I interrupting? Hi. Ms. Paik, I'm Juliet Carlson. I'm here to make sure your baby's okay. You must be the daddy. I'm sorry. You don't speak English. I'm... I'll try not to talk too much. Okay, you lift up your gown a little bit. It's a little cold. Okay. Let's take a look. Okay? There it is. There's your baby. Do you see that little flutter? Right there? That's the baby's heartbeat. Perfectly perfect in every way. I have your amnio results. Everything checked out. Would you lie to know if it's a boy or a girl? It's a girl. Yeah. Her name is Ji Yeon. That's a lovely name. And for the record, y... you two speak English just fine. Congratulations. Whoa! Easy, Bigfoot. It's just me. I found Locke. Son of a bitch said he's gonna destroy the island. You had it right, doc. Good news is, Desmond got out of that well, - so if we can find him before Smokey can... - It doesn't matter if we find Desmond or he does, James. We're all going to the same place anyway. Then what? Then it ends. - Hello, Mr. Locke. - Dr. Shephard. Hey, since you're about to open up my back, you can probably start calling me John. Okay, John. I thought I'd stop by and say hi before we started the anesthesia. You nervous? Are you sure this is gonna work? Yes. I'm very confident that it will. Really? Well, there's always the chance that I could kill you... But I'm trying to make you feel better. Okay. Okay, let's do it. All right. I'll see you on the other side. Hey, doctor, back at L.A.X. , when we met at baggage claim, you mentioned that they had lost your father. Did he ever turn up? As a matter of fact, I got a phone call this morning. - They, uh, they found the coffin. - Oh, good. Actually, it might be here already. Well, I hope that brings you some peace. If I can fix you, Mr. Locke, that's all the peace I'll need. That's gonna be a hell of a storm. Welcome to the club. What? You mind? Looks like you got your first gray hair. What are you smiling about? I think I just realized that I want to live. It's good timing. What was that? Help! Hey! Hey! Miles, up ahead! Hey! Ohh. Get him some water. What are you guys doing out here? We're going to hydra island to blow up a plane. What do you want to do that for? Because the black smoke wants to get off the island, and we have to stop that thing from leaving. Well, if we leave, that thing won't have a plane anymore. Yeah, and how are we gonna do that? In case you haven't noticed, I'm a pilot. - Well, this is gonna be interesting. - Kate! Kate! You killed them! Kate! That's it. - That's it. - You might wanna save your bullets. So it's you. Yeah, it's me. Jacob being who he is, I expected to be a little more surprised. You're sort of the obvious choice, - don't you think? - He didn't choose me. I volunteered. I assume you're here to stop me. I can't stop you. In fact, I, uh, I wanna go with you. I'm sorry, Jack. I think you're a little confused about what I came here to do. No, I'm not. No, you're going to the far side of the bamboo forest... to the place that I've sworn that I'll protect. And then you think you're gonna destroy the island. I "think"? That's right, because that's not what's gonna happen. Then what's gonna happen, Jack? I'm gonna kill you. How do you plan to do that? It's a surprise. Okay. Then let's get on with it. Doctor. Doctor. I didn't know you were working today. I just finished. Did you get the tickets for the concert? Yeah. Right here. Hey, dad, did you remember the tickets? I just gave them to your mom. - Uh, who's gonna take yours? - Well, if you don't have anybody else, maybe you could take aunt Claire. - I'm sure she'd love to get out of the house. - Oh, yeah. It's fine with me. In fact, I'm very curious to meet this mysterious sister you never mentioned the entire time we were married. Well, I'm sure you're gonna love her. She's extremely pregnant. Good luck on your surgery, doctor. Thank you. - Did you pick out a tie? - I did. Nice. Sorry. Hi. I'm Detective Ford, L.A.P.D. Mm-hmm. I'm looking for a patient's room... Sun Paik. Something you wanna share with the rest of us, doc? What's that? You said you were gonna kill Locke. - What's your surprise? - Desmond. And how's that gonna work? I'm not sure yet. I can't believe Jacob would've brought him all the way back to this island just so Locke could make him destroy it. - So what? Desmond's bait? - No. I think he's a weapon. That's a hell of a long con, doc. Jack, Desmond... it should just be the three of us from here on. Jack. I believe in you, dude. It's gonna be a bad one. We're here. This doesn't matter, you know. Excuse me? Him destroying the island, you destroying him... it doesn't matter. I mean, you're gonna lower me into that light, and I'm gonna go somewhere else... a place where we can be with the ones that we love and not have to ever think about this damn island again. And you know the best part, Jack? What? You're in this place. You know, we sat next to each other on Oceanic 815. It never crashed. We spoke to each other. You seemed happy. You know, maybe I can find a way to bring you there, too. Desmond, I tried that once. There are no shortcuts, no do-overs. What happened, happened. Trust me, I know. All of this matters. Shall we? What are we doing here? I'm not allowed to tell you. What do you mean, you're "not allowed"? There are rules, dude. Whose rules? Don't worry about it. Just trust me, okay? I trust you. And what, may I ask, have I done to deserve your trust? I think you're a good guy, Sayid. I know a lot of people have told you that you're not. Maybe you've heard it so many times you started believing it. But you can't let other people tell you what you are, dude. You have to decide that for yourself. I'm sorry. You clearly don't know anything about me. I know a lot about you, dude. Ohh! Looks like a gnarly fight. Hey, leave my brother alone! Uhh! Aah! Uhh! Hey, it's all right. Sayid. Shannon. I just got pounded, man. Thanks for taking your sweet time. It takes as long as it takes. It was a pain in the ass getting her here from Australia. Yeah. But, dude? It was worth it. Should I go get 'em? Nah. Let's give 'em a minute. Linus, are you there? What the hell's that? Miles, where are you? We just got to hydra island. - We're on our way to the plane. - Miles, listen to me. - Whatever you do, don't blow up that plane! - We're not gonna blow it up. We're gonna fly it the hell off the island. Just get over here now! What in the hell? Claire. Miles, it's Kate. Did you say "Claire"? Is she okay? Put the gun down. Don't come any closer! Miles? Miles, what happened? Miles, are you there? He sent you to kill me, didn't he? No, listen. We're not with Locke. Why should I believe you? Because we have a real chance to get far, far away from him. We can be free of everything he ever did to us and never look back. We can go home. Will you come with us, Claire? No. All right, we... we lower him down nice and easy. You know what to do once you get down there? Aye. I'll go where the light's brightest. Don't get yourself killed. This remind you of anything, Jack? What? Desmond... going down into a hole in the ground. If there was a button down there to push, we could fight about whether or not to push it. It'd be just like old times. You're not John Locke. You disrespect his memory by wearing his face, but you're nothing like him. Turns out he was right about most everything. I just wish I could've told him that while he was still alive. He wasn't right about anything, Jack. And when this island drops into the ocean, and you drop with it, you're finally gonna realize that. Well, we'll just have to see which one of us is right, then. Oh. It's the hospital. Go ahead. I'm sure it's important. I am so sorry. I will be back as soon as I can. I know. It's cool. Go. We'll get to know each other better, I hope? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Well, I, uh, I guess it's just you and me, kid. Oy. Wake up. Wake up. Come on. Wake up. What are you doin'? I'm just following the instructions. You're in the band, aren't you? How do you know that? Oh. I was shot by a fat man. It's all right. Excuse me. Hey, excuse me. Do you know where the band is? I'm sorry. Uh, pardon me? I... I think he's in the band. Yes, yes. Of course. He's the bass player from drive shaft. They're accompanying me tonight. I play piano. I'm Daniel. Daniel Widmore. I'm Charlotte. It's a great pleasure to meet you, Charlotte. You, too. Well, lead the way. Excuse me. Is this table 23? Aye. Indeed it is. Claire? I... You two know each other? Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention, please? Welcome to this very special benefit concert for the golden state natural history museum. I'm Dr. Pierre Chang. Thank you. I think we have quite a special evening ahead of us. So let's get to it, shall we? It is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Daniel Widmore, accompanied by drive shaft. Mm. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just... I'm just gonna use the bathroom. I'll... I'll be right back. No! No! It looks like... you were wrong. Good-bye, Jack. Uhh! Looks like you were wrong, too. Um, hello? Hello? Hi. Uh, do you know where the bathroom is? Mm! Ohh! Uh, can you please get a doctor? Small world, huh? Yeah, well, what are you doing... mm! Okay. Oh! Okay. Okay. - It's okay. Come on. Sit down. - Um, I... I think he's coming. I thought I made it clear that you were to stop this. Perfectly clear. I chose to ignore you. And once they know... what then? Then? We're leaving. Are you going to take my son? Not with me. No. Uhh! Just breathe, okay? Just breathe, breathe, breathe. - Help is on the way. - Mnh-mnh! It's hap... it's happening, like... like, right now. Right now? Um... Okay. Um... I'm gonna get you comfortable. I want you to relax and breathe, all right? - Just relax and breathe. - Who are you? I'm with the band. Listen, can you get us some water and blankets, please? Water and blankets? Yeah. All right. Uh... Claire... This is about the time when you're supposed to start pushing. Mnh-mnh. No, I'm not ready. I'm... I'm really scared. I'm scared, too, all right? Really scared. But I'm gonna need you to push because I can't do it without you. Okay? Okay. One, two, three. Push! Good. That's good. Okay, we're gonna try again. You're doing good. One, two, three. Push! Oh. Uh... okay. Push... push again. Push! Oh! Shh. It's Aaron. It's... I brought a blanket. Thank you. It's just a blanket. Then go ahead and bring it to her. Couldn't find any water. Charlie. Claire? Yeah. Claire. Hi, Aaron. Aaron. Hey. Aaron. Hey, Aaron. Do you understand? So now what? Hugo! Get out of the way! Ohh! Desmond! Desmond! We're gonna get you out of here, all right? It's too damn heavy! There's no way we're gettin' it off of him! We have to try! One... two... three!
