If I take him, he's not ever gonna be the same again. He will always be one of us. Get your ass out here right now, or I'm gonna kill your daughter. I stole her as a baby from an insane woman. She means nothing to me. So if you want to kill her, go ahead and do it. This guy is dangerous. Sun, that boat I came here on was filled with commandos whose only mission was to get him. And how'd that work out for everyone? - You know him? - Yeah. He's the man who killed me. What have you done, Richard? Calm down. Calm down. This has nothing to do with you. So it's true? You actually brought one of them to our temple? He's just a boy, and he was dying. Then you should've let him die. Jacob wanted it done. The island chooses who the island's chooses. You know that. Yes. yes, of course. What's his name? Hello, Benjamin. What happened? You were injured. How? You don't remember? Where am I? You're among friends. We're going to take care of you. My dad. Is he here? You'll be back to him soon enough. No. No, I don't want to go back. - Okay, easy. Easy. - Oh! I don't want to go back. I wanna stay. I wanna be one of you. Just because you're living with them doesn't mean you can't be one of us. You should be dead, Benjamin. But this island... it saved your life. Who are you? I'm Charles. Charles Widmore. Ben. Hello, Ben. Welcome back to the land of the living. My God. You're alive. Yes, I am. I knew it. I knew that this would happen. Then why are you so surprised to see me? Because it's one thing to believe it, John. It's another thing to see it. Then why were you trying to run away to the main island? I broke the rules, John. I came back to the island. I was going to answer for what I'd done. I was going back... to be judged. Judged? By whom? Well, John, we don't even have a word for it, but I believe you call it the monster. Lost Season 5 Episode 12: "Dead is Dead" Morning. Hello. What's in the crate? Just some stuff we need to get moved. Need a hand? No, thanks. We got it. Okay. Have a great day. How're you feeling, my friend? Like someone hit me with an oar, but I'll live. - What do you make of him? - I'm not sure. What has he told you? When you were out cold, he was watching over you. And he said you killed him. I killed him? Really? 'Cause he looks fine to me. You know, I don't really remember him from the plane. - Do you? - No, I don't. What if... he was already here, before we crashed? If he thinks I killed him, then he's insane. We may be dealing with a man who's dangerously deranged. Then the question is, what are we gonna do about it? Don't worry, my friend. I have your back. Caesar. Pleasure to meet you, Caesar. I'm Ben. You want me to do it? I can do it if you want me to, Ben. Shut up! And stay here, Ethan. Don't! Don't do it. You're the one who infected us, aren't you?! No! - Give me my baby. - It's okay. It's okay, baby. Please, don't take my Alex! Do you want your baby to live? Why are you taking her? Be grateful you're still alive. Now you listen to me. If you try to follow me or if you ever come looking for me, I'll kill you. And if you want your child to live, every time you hear whispers, you run the other way. What's that? Just something sentimental. So this is your old office, huh? I never pictured you leading your people from behind a desk. It seems a little... corporate. Was there something that you needed, John? Well, Ben, I was hoping that you and I could talk about the elephant in the room. I assume you're referring to the fact that I killed you. Yeah. It was the only way to get you back to the island, along with as many of those who left as possible. You do remember, John. That's why you left in the first place, to convince 'em to come back? But you failed. And the only way to bring them together was by your death, and you understood that. It's why you were about to kill yourself when I stopped you. If all I had to do was die, Ben, then why did you stop me? You had critical information that would've died with you. And once you'd given it to me... Well, I just didn't have time to talk you back into hanging yourself. So I took a shortcut. And look at you, John. I was right. You're here. you're back. So are the rest of them. I don't know where yet exactly, but they came. It worked. And that's why I did it, because it was in the best interests of the island. I was just hoping for an apology. I've decided to help you, Ben. Help me do what? Do what you say you are on your way to do.</i> Be judged. That's not something you want to see, John. If everything you've done has been in the best interests of the island, then I'm sure the monster will understand. Let's go. - What are you doing? - We're taking a boat. Where? Over to the main island. I don't think so, my friend. Are these your boats? Are they yours? Caesar, right? I was under the impression these were found here. So I'm just gonna borrow one. I'm happy to leave the other boat for you in case you want to follow us. "Us"? Are you going with him? He didn't really give me a choice. I'm sorry, but I'm calling the shots here and I say you are not taking anything. What you are going to do is to sit down and tell us how you know so much about this island, my friend. You're in the habit of calling people "friends" but I don't think you mean it. Step away from the boat. No, I'm not gonna step away from the boat. I'm gonna take it, and you're gonna let me, my friend. You're not taking anything. You looking for this? This gentleman and I are taking a boat. Does anyone else have a problem with that? Consider that my apology. Home, sweet home. Looks like we're not the first ones who decided to tie up here. That would be Sun and Lapidus. I showed 'em where the boats were, and Sun thanked me by smashing me on the head with a paddle. Oh. Is she the one that hurt your arm? I noticed you were favoring it on the way over. No. Someone else hurt my arm. You just make friends everywhere you go, don't ya? Well, I've found sometimes that friends can be significantly more dangerous than enemies, John. Is that why you shot an unarmed man in the chest? The man was unarmed because I'd stolen his gun - the gun he was going to use to kill you. I couldn't let that happen. No sense in me dying twice, right? You're welcome. We're going to your old house, aren't we? Yes. It's the only place I can summon it. The "monster." Once it arrives, I'll either be forgiven or I won't. I think you're lying. Lying about what? That you want to be judged for leaving the island and coming back because it's against the rules. I don't think you care about rules. Then what do I want to be judged for, John? For killing your daughter. Did you do it? We had a... complication. I'm sorry. Is that a... baby? Your orders were to exterminate that woman. Why? she's no threat to us. She's insane, Charles. Besides, you didn't tell me she had a child. What was it I was supposed to do? Kill it. It's not an "it." This is a child. You might find this difficult to understand, Benjamin. Every decision I've made has been about protecting this island. Is killing this baby what Jacob wants? Then here she is. You do it. So whose idea was it to move into these houses? Excuse me? Well, your people were living in the jungle. And then after you murdered the Dharma folk, you relocated here. I just wondered if it was your idea. Do you disapprove, John? It just doesn't seem like something the island would want. You don't have the first idea what this island wants. Are you sure about that? That was your house, wasn't it? Yes, and that's Alex's room. Well, I suppose you better go over there and check it out. Sun? What are you doing here? This used to be my house. I saw a light turned on. What are the two of you doing in here? That was taken in 1977. Are you trying to tell me that your friends were in the Dharma Initiative? You don't know about this? Of course not. Where did you get this? Who gave this to you? We met some crazy old man outside. He said his name was Christian. He told us to come in here and wait. Wait for what? He said if I ever wanted to see my husband again, I had to wait here for John Locke. But considering he's dead, we ain't holding our breath. Well, you might want to look outside. What you're saying, it's... Impossible. But here I am. I don't know how, I don't know why, but I'm sure there's a very good reason for it. As long as the dead guy says there's a reason, well, then I guess everything's gonna be just peachy. And forget about the fact that the rest of your people are supposedly 30 years ago. Now the only ones who are here to help us are a murderer and a guy who can't seem to remember how the hell he got out of a coffin. Sun, please, let's just go back to the plane, see if I can fix the radio, and maybe we can get some help. If you leave with him, you'll never find your husband again. I'm all the help you need. Are you saying you know how to find them? How to find Jin? I have some ideas. I'm sorry to say, but I'm leaving with or without you. If there's any chance of finding my husband, then I have to stay. All right. For god's sake, watch your back. All right. How do we find Jin? Ben has something to do first. Isn't that right, Ben? Yes, John. That's right. Better get to it then. I'll be outside. Again, daddy! Again! - Okay, okay. - Wow, Alex! Any higher, and you're gonna fly right off the island. The sub's about to leave. Higher, daddy, higher! All right. You don't have to see him off, Ben. Yes, Richard, I do. Higher! Higher, daddy! Charles! I came to say good-bye. No, you didn't. You came to gloat. No, don't act as if I wanted this. You brought this on yourself. Are you quite certain you want to do this, Benjamin? You left the island regularly. You had a daughter with an outsider. You broke the rules, Charles. And what makes you think you deserve to take what's mine? Because I won't be selfish. Because I'll sacrifice anything to protect this island. You wouldn't sacrifice Alex. You're the one who wanted her dead, Charles, not the island. I hope you're right, Benjamin, because if you aren't, and it is the island that wants her dead, she'll be dead. And one day, you'll be standing where I'm standing now. You'll be the one being banished, and then you'll finally realize that you cannot fight the inevitable. I'll be seeing you, boy. Where did John go? He said he had something to do. Did he say what it was? No, I didn't ask. Jack must have lied. - Excuse me? - About Locke being dead? I don't know why he would, but that's the only explanation. Jack didn't lie. John was dead. Just because he was in a coffin doesn't mean that he couldn't have faked his dea-- Trust me. I'm sure. So you knew this would happen to Locke if we brought him back here? Sun, I had no idea it would happen. I've seen this island do miraculous things. I've seen it heal the sick, but never once has it done anything like this. Dead is dead. You don't get to come back from that, not even here. So the fact that John Locke is walking around this island... scares the living hell out of me. You may want to go inside. Why? Because what's about to come out of that jungle is something I can't control. Any luck? It hasn't shown up yet. Last time we didn't have to wait this long. It's not a train, John. It doesn't run on a schedule. Well, if it's not gonna come to us, then... I suppose we'll have to go to it. It doesn't work that way. I only know how to summon it. I don't know where it actually is. I do. It's weird for me, too. Excuse me? I realize how strange this all is. Me, here. But I assure you, Sun, I'm the same man I've always been. Are you ready? Lead the way. Hello? Charles? It's Benjamin. How did you get this number? Doesn't matter. What matters is, I'm going back to the island today. The island won't let you come back, trust me. I've spent almost 20 years trying to return. Well, Charles, where you failed, I'm going to succeed. Just as soon as I do one thing. And what's that, Benjamin? Kill your daughter. In fact, I'm looking at "Our Mutual Friend" right now. I don't know what you're talking about. It's the name of the boat that Penny's on. Don't you dare. Good-bye, Charles. May I ask you a question, John? Shoot. How is it that you know where you're going? I just know. I mean, how does that work, exactly? - How does what work? - The knowing. I mean, did it come upon you gradually, or did you wake up one morning, suddenly understanding the mysteries of the universe? - You don't like this, do you? - What? Having to ask questions that you don't know the answers to, blindly following someone in the hopes that they'll lead you to whatever it is you're looking for. No, John, I don't like it at all. Well, now you know what it was like to be me. We should keep moving. Yes, we should. I think I know where we're going now, John. Do you? It's the same place they brought me as a child. It's where the island healed me. Let's hope it's as generous this time around. What is it? It's the wall around our temple. What temple? About a half mile from here. We built this wall to keep people like the two of you from ever seeing it. We're not going into your temple, Ben. We're going under it. After you. I need to ask a favor of you, Sun. If you can ever get off this island, find Desmond Hume for me. Tell him I said I was sorry. Sorry for what? He'll know. What are you doing here? Desmond! Desmond! Des?! Don't move. Not another word. Hello, Penelope. My name is Benjamin Linus. I'm sorry that you're caught up in the middle of this thing, but your father-- My father and I have absolutely no relationship whatsoever, - so whatever-- - Your father is a really terrible human being. He's responsible for the killing of my daughter. That's why I'm here. Mommy! Charlie, go back inside, babe. Go back inside. Please. Please, whatever you do, don't hurt my son. Please don't hurt my son. Mommy? Mommy? Charlie, go inside! Captain Lapidus! Captain Lapidus!</i> You're back. Thank God. They found guns. What are you talking about? Who found guns? Ilana and three of the others. They said they were in charge now. Where are they? Ilana! What's going on? What lies in the shadow of the statue? What? Answer the question! What lies in the shadow of the statue? I have no idea what the-- Get everyone else. Tell them it's time. And tie him up. He's coming with us. You know, you were right. About what? Why I need to be judged. When Charles Widmore's men came, they gave me a choice. Either leave the island or let my daughter die. All I had to do was walk out of the house and go with them. But I didn't do it. So you were right. John, I did kill Alex. And now I have to answer for that. I appreciate you showing me the way, but I think I can take it from here. You got it. I'll meet you outside, if I live-- Ben! Are you all right? Never better. Hang on. I'll find something to get you out of there. John, wait! You didn't tell me that she had a child.</i> What was it I was supposed to do? - Kill it. - It's not an "it." This is a child.</i> Higher! Again, daddy! Again! Higher! Higher, daddy! I hate you! I hate your guts! I wish you were dead.</i> These people. You said they're dangerous. More dangerous than you? Dad, they're serious. They killed Karl and my mother. Please, dad. Help me! She's not my daughter. She means nothing to me. So if you wanna kill her, go ahead and--</i> Daddy? Alex. Hi, dad. Oh, Alex. I'm so, so sorry. It was all my fault. I know. Listen to me, you bastard! I know that you're already planning to kill John again, and I want you to know that if you so much as touch him, I will hunt you down and destroy you. You will listen to every word John Locke says, and you will follow his every order. Do you understand? Say it! Say you'll follow him. Yes, I will. I'll follow him. I swear. Ben? Ben! Ben? What happened? It let me live. subtitle by unknown (credits removed)
