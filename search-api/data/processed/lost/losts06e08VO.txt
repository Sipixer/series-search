That case just accidentally flew open? How stupid do you think I am? Pretty damn stupid, actually. Excuse me? This is a setup, lady. There's a van sittin' right outside. The room is bugged. The place is surrounded by cops. So now you wanna put that gun down, And we'll work something out. They don't care about you. They want your husband. There's a tracer in the case. All you had to do Was take it back to wherever your hubby's hiding out. You really except me to believe That you're working with the police? If this place is surrounded, How come no one came to save you? I don't need saving, 'cause you're gonna do the right thing And put that gun down. But if you don't, Well, then all I gotta do is say the magic work, And that door busts open. You're a lousy con man. Lafleur. "La" What? Police! Drophe gun! behind your back. Cuttin' it a little close, huh? Only way to cut it. put your damn clothes on, jim. You got it, partner. You're a cop? Surprise. let's go. Move. Is this where you lived? Yeah. What is that? It's all I had. all right, everybody, listen up! Come on in. Gather 'round. I know that everyone is tired. It was a... A long and traumatic night for all of us. And you all have got a lot of questions, I know, And I will make myself available to answer them. But right now we need to keep moving. We have to take advantage of the daylight. We wanna know What happened to the people who stayed behind at the temple. The black smoke killed them. Hey. I know that what happened back there was really scary. But it's over. You're with me now, And I promise that I'm gonna take care of you. Okay. Alright, let's move out. Sounds like you had a hell of a night. Yeah. Jack, hurley, the rest of 'em-- They make it out of the temple all right? I saw them leaving on my way back. What about miles? I don't know what happened to him. So you're with lockeow? I ain't with anybody, kate. Hello. Is this anthony cooper? Hi, mr. Cooper. This is detective james ford, l.A.P.D. Yeah, we've discovered some unclaimed property That might belong to you.

I'm gonna have to call you back. Who's anthony cooper? Old buddy I ran into. Said he could hook me up with some laker tickets. That's cool. What, did you- -you see him in palm springs? What?

We'll make camp there. Everybody fill up on water. We might be there a couple of days. A couple of days? I thought you said we were gettin' off this rock. We are. When? Maybe we should talk about this in private? Great. Let's go. I wish you hadn't interrupd me. I'm sorry. I forgot my manners. I forgive ya. What happened back at the temple? How'd you know to rescue everybody from that smoke thing? I didn't rescue them. I'm the smoke thing. You telling me you killed all those people? I gave them the opportunity to leave peacefully, And they didn't take it. Why not? Because they're convinced That they're protecting the island from me, When, in fact, all I wanna do is leave. So it's either kill or be killed. And I don't want to be killed. We goin' on a boat ride? You are. Where? Hydra island. What's on hydra island? The plane. The ajira flight. The same plane that brought your friends back. Unfortunately, they didn't come alone. And I have reaso to believe that Some of the other passengers mean to do us all harm. So I want you to go over there and do some recon. Well, that sounds safe. You'll be fine. Yeah? Well, what am I supposed to do If I run into somebody who wants to do me harm? I'm not worried about that. Oh, you're not, huh? No, because you are the best liar I ever met. You tell 'em whatever you need to tell 'em To gain their trust, find out everything you can about them, And then get back here. Why exactly am I doing this again? Why do you think, james? We get on the plane, we fly off this island, And we never look back. Come on. yeah? Miles, what's this girl look like again? She's a redhead. How many- how many redheads do you see? Roger that.

Yes. I'm exactly like indiana jones. You got a whip? Maybe. So, um, what about you? What about me? Why did you become a cop? You ever seen "Bullitt steve mcqueen flick. No. Well, then I won't even bore you with an explanation. Okay, do me a favor, james, and don't treat me like All the other girls who ask you. Tell me the truth. Well... I guess I... Got to a point in my life Where I was either gonna come a criminal or a cop. So I chose cop. What? You know what. Well, not bad, considering we didn't have that whip. Bring it next time. You want some water? Mm-hmm. Yes, please. You mind if I borrow a t-shirt? Help yourself. Top drawer on the right. Thanks. What the hell are you doing? Um, I was just looking foa t-shirt.

This is completely inappropriate. All right? Now... You go over there. I'll deal with you in a minute. Go. You all right? No, I'm not all right! Hey! Stop! No! Oh! Don't move! please don't hurt me! Who the hell are you? I'm the only one left. Excuse me, sir? I asked you about my brother. I told you. I'll be with you in a minute. Hey, uh, I'm looking for my brother. Uh, he was arrested at the airport on a drug charge. Sorry. Not my department. Mornin', sunshine. Come with me. Whoa! What the hell is your-- shut up! Is there something you wanna tell me? What?! Is there something you wanna tell me? Look, she opened the wrong drawer. What the hell are you talking about? I wanna know what you were doing in australia When you told me you were in palm springs. I ran your credit card. I know you went to sydney. Oceanic. Round trip. You took flight 815 back 2 days ago. What the helare you doin' running my credit card? You lied to me! 're supposed to trust each other. So, jim... What were you doing in australia? That's none of your damn business. You know what? You're right, Because I'm not your partner anymore. You thirsty? Very. I'm sawyer. Ahh. I'zoe. I can't believe there's anybody left alive. I thought I knew everybody on the plane. I didn't come on this plane. What plane did you come on? Long story. What the hell happened here? What killed all those people? I... We--we crashed here, And we were all just waiting for... Someone to rescue us. I was out collecting wood When I heard... Screaming. Screaming? When... When I came back... They were-- they were all dead. I spent the last two days dragging their bodies up here. I didn't feel it was right to leave them out there in the sun. Are you alone? No. I'm with a group of people back on the main island. I can take you back there. Oh, thank god. Trust me, God's got nothing to do with it. I'm sorry, kate. Excuse me? I have to take responsibility for claire's behavior. I was the one who told her that the others had her baby. Why would you tell her that? Have you ever had an enemy? Someone that you needed to hate? Very powerful, isn't it? Claire was devastated without aaron. She needed something to... Something to keep her going, so... I gave her something to hate. And then when you told her the truth, All those feelings, all--all that anger That she'd been holding on to for so long-- It had to go somewhere. Very insightful... Coming from a dead man. Mm. Well, nobody's perfect. I'm sorry that this happened. And I'm sure if you give her time, Everything will be all right. I promised before that I would keep everyone safe, And that means you, too, kate. Where did sawyer go? I'll show you. think that thing'll still fly? I don't know. It'll take a bit of work And someone who knows how to- how to do it. I-I take it you haven't come across the pilot? No, ma'am. How many people did you say were with you? Couple dozen. Did they all come on the same plane with you? Some, not all. When did you crash? Long time ago. Do you all have guns? I mean, whoever killed those people back there, They--they might come back. Yeah, we got plenty of guns. You wanna grab that end? Where'd you say you were headed? What's that? Your flight. Where were you going? Oh. Uh... Guam. What's in guam? My boyfriend. You're good, sweetheart, but you ain't that good. What are you talking about? Who are you? Drop it now! Your name even zoe? Is yours sawyer? Down on your knees! All right, all right. You got me. Take me to your leader. That island over there- that's where I sent sawyer. You could've just told me That you sent him to the island where we were locked in cages. You didn't have to bring me down here. Sure, but then I wouldn't have gotten to talk to you. You referred to me as a dead man. I am not a dead man. I know what you're feeling, kate. I know what you're going through. How do you know that? Because... My mother was crazy. A long time ago, before I... Looked... Like this, I had a mother, just like everyone. She was a very disturbed woman. And as a result of that... I had some growing pains... Problems that I'm still trying to work my way through. Problems that... Could h-have been avoided, Had things been different. Why are you telling me this? Because now... Aaron... Has a crazy mother, too. Get in. He's waiting for you. It's not me I'm worried about. I just don't know what I'd do If anything ever happened to you and ma. Anyway, nothing's gonna happen to us. Not today, anyway. It's the way you live this life, Each day one at a time. Now if you spend your whole life Worrying about something that's gonna happen, Before you know it, your life's over And you spent an awful lot of it just worrying. Hey, you hear that? That's what life's all about-- Laughing and loving each other, And knowing that people aren't really gone when they die. We have all the good memories to sustain us Until we see 'em again. It's hard not being afraid, pa. I know, sweetheart I know. You've got to be joking. May I come in? Absolutely not. Why not? You don't get to kick me out at 3: 00 in the morning And then come 'round the next day With puppy dog eyes and a sad sunflower. Look, I don't know If you're just lonely or guilty or completely mad. Buy you know what? I don't care. You blew it. What you got in here? None of your business. Keep moving. Come. He's here, sir. Thanks, zoe. Would you leave us, please? Of course. Hello, mr. Ford. My name is charles widmore. Do you know who I am? Of course I do. You're the fella sent a freighter to the island, It's sad, really... How little you actually know. Well, I know you murdered all them people out there And dropped 'em in the ditch. We didn't murder those people. But I don't expect you to believe that. Good, 'cause I don't. So why don't you tell me what brought you over to this island? John locke sent me. John locke's dead. I think we both know the guy I'm talking about Is not really locke. So here's the deal, chief. I'll go back over there and tell him the coast is clear, That I didn't find anybody. Then I'll bring the old man right to your doorstep. Then you can kill him. And what do you want in exchange, james? One-- the people I come back with-- The people on my boat-- Don't get touched, not even a hair on their head. And two-- You give us safe passage off the island. How do I know I can trust you? Same way I know I can trust you. So... Do we have an agreement? I suppose we do. Kate. I-- I just, um... I-I just wanna say I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that. I know everything you did was just 'cause you care about me And out aaron. thank you. Thank you for taking care of him. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. How'd go? You didn't really send me over there To find passengers from that plane, did you? No. Well, in case you're interested, They're all dead. Well, that's terrible. What happened? I don't know. Well, what do you know, james? I know there's a man over there on that island That ain't gonna let us get on that plane without a fight. Came over on a sub. Name's widmore. Charles widmore? Well, I guess y'all know each other. He ain't alone. I counted at least six armed compadres with him, Not to mention whatever crew's on that sub. There's a locked room on there- somethin' they're hiding. And they're settin' up pylons, like the ones at new otherton. You know... The ones that keep out that smoke thing. And what did you tell them about me? I told them I'd tell you the coast was clear and bring you back with me. Walk you right into their trap. That way, they could kill you... Which means they'll be caught with their pants down When we change our plan of attack. I appreciate your loyalty, james. You said you were gonna get me off this island. Deal's a deal. What are you doing here? Get in t car. Who's sawyer? When I was 9 years old, My father shot my mother, and then he killed himself. Sawyer was the reason why. He was a grifter. Con man. I've been hunting him down Since the day I left the academy. I chased down a lead in australia, Got a name--anthony cooper. I ran the name. I got a list of anthony coopers, And I've been calling them. And when I find the right one... I'm gonna kill him. Why didn't you tell me any of this? I knew you'd try and talk me out of it. Damn right. Fair enough. whoa! My car! Hey! Uhh! Son of a bitch. What's for dinner? Rabbit. I think. Good. I'm starving. What are you doing running errands for locke? I ain't runnin' errands for nobody. He said he sent you over to the other island. Did you find the plane? Yeah. And that ain't the only thing over there. A guy named widmore set up camp on the beach, Got a whole team with him-- Guys with guns. They're here for locke. So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna let them fight it out. And while they got their hands full with each other... You and me are gettin' the hell off this island. Even if we could get on that pla, who's gonna fly it? We ain't taking the plane, freckles.
