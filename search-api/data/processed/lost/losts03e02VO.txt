This camp Michael is leading you to-- that is where they will set their trap. - And I can go ashore undetected. - How? We will sail the boat and scout them. This time they will know that we are coming. Hi, Jack. - I'm Juliet. - Where are my friends? Tell me where my friends are! My husband says it's time to leave. He doesn't think Jack and the others are coming. It's been over a day since we lit the fire. They should be here by now. Jack knows we're out here. He's counting on our signal. Perhaps he's not able to see the smoke. If he's north of us, the mountains would block his view. We need to sail forward along the coast, Clear the mountains and start another signal fire. I told Jack I would light a fire. I'm not abandoning him. My husband thinks we have to do as he says, Because he's the only one who knows how to sail. But he's wrong. I can help you sail the boat. Are you feeling any better? I made the soup myself, but I won't take it the wrong way if you don't like it. You never made soup for me. Am I interrupting something? Would it really matter if you were? We have a situation. Brian radioed in. The Iraqi found the decoy village. Good. It's what we wanted. Brian followed him back to the shore. Ben, they have a sailboat. - How? - I have no idea. So they have a boat. Sailing in circles will keep them busy. They could find us. - Ben... - I'm thinking. How quickly can you put together a team? - Within the hour. - Then don't waste time talking to us. Hey, Colleen. I want that boat. Transcript : www.1000fr.com Sync : www.sub-way.fr (V.0.90) 3x02 - The Glass Ballerina Nice alarm clock. I've woken up to worse. You want half a fish biscuit? - What's this? - Lunch. We're gonna need you to keep up your strength. Is that right? - Danny, wait. - Hold up. They have a boat. Ben wants us to take the galaga and retrieve... Okay. Be careful out there. What are you looking at? What's wrong? What's wrong is I'm married. Right. That. I don't want to share you anymore. Your english is excellent now. We can go to america. - Does anyone know you're... - No. All right, here's the jig. See these rocks here? That's where you two come in. You're gonna chop 'em loose, and you're gonna haul 'em outta here. You expect me to work in this dress? It's up to you. You can take it off if you want. How dare you? Now if you need anything, you raise your hand. - You get ten minutes for lunch-- - I got a question, boss. - No questions. - She got to ask a question. If you try to run off, you will be shocked. Shot? Don't we even get a warning? Shocked. I said shocked. If you talk to each other, you'll be shocked. You touch each other, you'll be shocked. If you're slacking, you're gonna get shocked. Matter of fact, you do anything at all that pisses me off, you're gonna get shocked. Okay? Let's get to work. I'm not doing anything until I see Jack. Now that was a quarter charge. You got any more questions? Soon as you're able to walk, wheelbarrow's right over there. Why should there be a dock all the way out here? Others. The dock's decaying. It's overgrown. It looks like it hasn't been used in quite some time. Whoever built it, they're not here now. Let's bring the boat in. We'll tie to the dock and build a fire on the beach. The visibility's excellent, And Jack will be able to see us from miles around. Safe? Yes, Jin. Of course it's safe. Get back to work. Whatever you say, boss. Careful. Don't let them see you talking to me. Are they keeping you in the cages? Did you see another guy in there with you? About my age, named Karl? No. It's just Sawyer and me. You're not even supposed to be in that cage. What are you talking about? Who are you? Where'd you get that dress? They gave it to me. It's mine. You can keep it. It looks better on you anyway. Wait. Wait. Having fun yet, freckles? Quit staring at my ass. Give me something else to stare at. Shut up! Yes, sir, boss. Thank you. What else can I do? Help your husband. We need as much wood as we can find. We're building quite a large fire. We have to make sure Jack will see the smoke. Why are you lying to me, Sayid? And what would you know about lying, Sun? You're putting our lives in danger. I'm fairly certain our friends have been captured. There are tracks all over the dock. They're fresh, as recent as yesterday. You said this dock was abandoned. That would be part of the lying you mentioned. You're not building this fire for our people. You're building it for the others. I suspect that when they see the smoke, they'll send a scout party to investigate. By then it will be night. When they arrive, I'll ambush them. I'll take two of them hostage, - and I'll kill the rest. - Two? One to make the other cooperate. What do you need me to do? I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to lie to Jin for another 20 minutes. Why? Because once the fire is lit, it will be too late to go back. Gun. I don't think I understand. What is it? He knows what we're doing. He knows it's a trap. He says he understands english etter than I think he does. He knows I betrayed him. Gun. Can you handle one of these? It's an automatic-- I think you'll be safer on the boat. If by chance they get past us, there's another gun. It's inside the blue tarp beneath the galley counter. If they get past you, that means my husband is dead... and I won't care anymore. As I said, lhe gun is inside the tarp. - Back off! - James. Put the gun down... right now. Put the gun down. I don't think they're coming. I want you to let me off this boat. I can't do that. - Why not? - That's not my decision to make. You realize there are five of my friends up there-- Lower your voice. - I'll shoot. - No, you won't, Sun. I know you, Sun-Hwa Kwon. And I know you're not a killer. Despite what you may think, I am not the enemy. We are not the enemy. But if you shoot me... that's exactly what we'll become. I will. I'll shoot you. Sun! I'm sorry I dragged you into this. And please communicate to your husband, the next time, I will listen to him. We should go. We have a long walk ahead of us. You okay? Never better. What the hell were you thinking? I couldn't help myself. You just looked so damn cute swinging that pickax. Chain gang looks good on you, freckles. Sawyer. Two of those guards got some real fight in 'em. Rest of 'em, I ain't that much worried about. That heavyset guy packs a hell of a punch. Shaggy-Haired kid's got some sort of martial arts training, but I think I could take him if I had to. Oh, and F.Y.I., those zapper things got a safety on 'em. Did you see the look on their faces when you got a hold of that rifle? I'm guessin' most of these boys never seen any real action. But that blonde who had a gun to your head... she woulda shot you, no problem. Why'd she call you James? 'Cause that's my name. I noticed somethin' else, too. You taste like strawberries. You taste like fish biscuits. So what do we do now? Well, shortcake... now we wait for these bastards to make a mistake. Sooner or later, they're gonna let their guard down.</i> And when they do, we're gonna be there to put 'em in their place.</i> Hello, Jack. You know what's crazy Jack? A week ago, you and I were in exactly the opposite situation. I was the one locked up, and you were the one coming in for visits. And I know that you were angry, that I lied to you about who I was, but... Hell ! Do you blame me? I mean, let's face it. If I'd have told you I was one of those people, that you and your friends have been calling "others" all this time, it would've been right back to Sayid and his... fists. Wouldn't it? What do you want from me? I want for you to change your... perspective. And the first step in doing that would be for me to... be decent enough to introduce myself honestly, so... Hi. My name is Benjamin Linus, and I've lived on this island all my life. You're not gonna shake? Bring it in, please. Where are Kate and Sawyer? They're fine, and they're close. That's all I'm able to tell you right now. You can tell me anything you want. Fair enough. It's all I want to tell you. I'm gonna make this really simple, Jack. If you cooperate, we send you home. Cooperate with what? - When the time is right, I'll tell you. - You tell me now. Patience, Jack. - Patience. - Home. Is that where you sent Walt and Michael? Yes. If you could leave this island, why would you still be here? Yes, Jack. Why would we be here? You're lying. You're stuck here just like we are. You dont have any... Your flight crashed on september 22, 2004. Today is november 29th. That means you've been on our island for 69 days. And, yes, we do have contact with the outside world, Jack. That's how we know that during those 69 days, your fellow americans reelected George W. Bush, Christopher Reeve has passed away, Boston Red Sox won the world series. What? If you wanted me to believe this, you probably should've picked somebody else besides the Red Sox. No, they were down three games to none against the Yankees in the league championship, and then they won eight straight. Sure, sure. Of course they did. back to Foulke. Red Sox fans have longed to hear it. The Boston Red Sox are world champions! A clean sweep of the St Louis Cardinals, and the Red Sox celebrate in the middle of the diamond here at Busch stadium.</i> That's home, Jack, right there on the other side of that glass. And if you listen to me, if you trust me,
