It was my call. I'm going after it whether they're on it or not. Oh, my god. Lapidus! Yeah! Where'd they go? They're up by some greenhouse, perched up there, waitin' to stch linus. If you can move the island whenever you wanted, why didn't you just move it befo the psychos with guns got here? It's a measure of last resort. You're gonna go into that greenhouse. The elevator takes you down to the actual orchid station. I'm sorry, man, but maybe I missed the part where you explained what I'm supposed to do about the armed men inside. How many times do I have to tell you, john? I always have a plan. These aren't jack or sawyer. Whoever you are, come out now! My name is benjamin linus. I believe you're looking for me. Ladies and gentlemen, the survivors of oceanic 8-1-5. Is it possible there are any other survivors from the crash yet to be discovered? No, absolutely not. Why did you call me, jack? I was hoping that you'd heard, that maybe you'd go to the funeral. Why would I go to the funeral? - This is not gonna change... - no,I'm sick. Of lying. I have to go. - He's gonna be wondering where I am... - don'T. We were not supposed to leave. Yes, we were. Good-bye, jack. We have to go back, kate. We have to go back! "we have to go back"? "We have to go back"? - Now hold on... - who you think you are? You call me over and over again for two days straight, stoned on your pills! And then you show up here with an obituary for jeremy bentham. When he came to me and I heard what he had to say, I knew he was crazy. But you. You believed him. Yes. Him, of all people. Yes, kate, I did, because he said that that was the only way that I could keep you safe... you and aaron. Don't you say his name. I still have to explain to him why you are not there to read to him, so don't you say his name! I'm sorry. I've spent the last three years trying tforget all the horrible things that happened on the day that we left. How dare you ask me to go back? You sure we're going the right way? Lapidus said they were headed northeast. You might wanna slow down a little, 'cause you look like you're about to keel over, doc. I'm fine. Of course you're fine. You're always fine. Is this it? I don't know. So what's the plan, sundance? The plan is we wait till... - hugo? - Sawyer! You all right? Dude, you came back. How'd you know where I was? It's good to see you, hurley. Yeah. Yeah, man. You, too. So where the hell is he? Locke! Hello, jack. There's enough c4 here to blow up a bloody aircraft carrier. When I was in the army. I did six months explosive ordnance disposal, whh, as the saying goes, is just enough time to lea how to bloyourself up. Is it on a timer? And why hasn't it gone off et? This is a-a radio receiver. It'S. It's like a walkie-talkie. You send it a signal, and, uh. It... It triggers the bomb remotely. So can we. Turn off? This is A. This is a trip wire. Move it, and. Boom. This is dummy wiring. If you cut the wrong one. Boom this is multiple firing systems. You disable one, the next one. Boom. Um, this. Battery's the power source. - If you disconnect it. - boom. -=www. Ydy. com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> -=www. Ydy. com/bbs=- sync: »ð¼ýÈýÖí</font> LOST Season Finale</font> What are you doing in here? There's a-a dharma station below us, and, um, I'm looking for a way to get in. Get in and do what? Hugo, james, would you mind if I spoke to jack alone? Don't bother. We just came back for hurley. Let's go. Jack, you need to hear what I have to say... No, what I need to do is to walk back to the chopper, get on it, and get the rest of our people off this island. Uh, dude, probably not the best idea righnoW. Those rambo guys are taking ben to that helicopter. He surrendered himself to 'em about an hour ago. Now why the hell would he do that? So tell me something, ben. What is it that makes you so important, hmm? I'm curious. I'm curious as to why Mr. Widmore would pay me so much money just to come out here and capture you and bring you back alive. Charles widmore tell you to kill my daughter? How'd he get the toolbox? Damn. Who gave you the toolbox, frank? Well... You're good right there. Who are you? I'm kate. I'm one of the passengers of flight 815. Why are you running? I'm being chased. By his people. Kocol. Lacour. Redfern on flank. Come here. Get on your knees. Hands above your heads, both of you. Now! Spray it! Ben, stay close. Run! Run. Grenade! Get up. Come on. Thank you for coming, richard. My pleasure. Could you cut me free, kate? What was the arrangement? They, uh, help us free you, and we let 'em off the island. Fair enough. The helicopter is yours. You and sayid have a safe journey back. So we can go? Off the island? That's it? That's it. Thank you, miss. Are you hurley? Yeah. Are you dangerous? I'm sorry. Do I know you? No, you don't know me. But you know my grandson. Nowe've traveled all the way across country just so he could see you. I need to know if you're gonna do anything crazy. I won't do anything crazy. Hey, walt. Hey, hurley. You're getting big, dude. You know, when you came back, I was waiting for one of you to come see me, but. Nobody did. I'm sorry. Do you know who did come see me? Jeremy bentham. I don't undetand why you're all lying. We're lying. Because it's the only way to protect everyone that didn't come back. Like my dad? Like your dad, yeah. What the hell they talkin' about in there, anyway? I don't know. Leader stuff? Where'd you get that? Came from a box ben dug up out of the ground. They're good. Thanks for coming back for me. Ah, you got it. Claire and the baby okay? What did you wanna talk to me about, john? I want you to reconsider leaving the island, jack. I would like you to stay. You'd like me to stay. Yeah, that's right. You threw a knife into the back of an unarmed woman. You led half of our people across the island and got most of them killed. Well, jack, you put a gun to my head and you pulled the trigger. I was hoping we could let bygones be bygones. Well, I' tell you what. You stay here in your little greenhouse, but the rest of us are going home. But you're not supposed to go home. And what am I supposed to do? Oh, I think I remember. What was it that you said on the way out to the hatch... That crashing here was our destiny? You know, jack. You know that you're here for a reason. You know it. And if you leave this place, that knowledge is gonna eat you alive from the inside out. Until you decide to come back. Good-bye, john. You're gonna have to lie. Excuse me? If you have to go, then you have to lie about everything. Everything that happened since we got to the island it's the only way to protect it. It's an island, john. No one needs to protect it. It's not an island. It's a place where miracles happen. And... And... if you... if you don't believe that, jack, if you can't believe that, just wait till you see what I'm about to do. There's no such thing as miracles. Well. We'll just have to see which one of us is right. Am I interrupting? Nice to see you, too, jack. Couldn't find the anthiums, could you? I don't know what they look like. What are you doing? Didn't you tell him? I tried. Sayid and kate are waiting for you at the helicopter. I understand that your people from the beach are being brought to the freighter even as we speak. What? I'd love to fill you in on everything you missed, jack, but you, hugo, james, you need to get moving. If I were you, I'd want to be on that boat within the hour. Good-bye, jack. Let's go. Lie to them, jack. If you do it half as well as you lie to yourself, they'll believe you. Michael? What's going on down there? Did you tell anybody? No, michael. I-I didn'T. Can you. T-turn it off? It isn't even on yet. But, yeah, if what's in this tank does what it's supposed to do, we're gonna be okay. Look, I'll send jin upstairs. There's no need for him to be down there with me when he can be up here with you. I'm pregnant. Congratulations, sun. You're gonna what? Freeze it. This is liquidgeitroN. We use it in the refrigeration hold. The bomb needs a charge from the battery to detonate, right? And the battery runs on a-a chemical reaction. I spray the battery. I can keep it cold. No reaction. And what's the catch? The catch is we only have one canister. We use it up, we're right back where we started. Well, shouldn't we save it till the light turns red? If we see that light turn red and the battery's not already cold, that is the last thing we will ever see. Either way, at least we'll have a warning, buy ourselves some time. All right, um, freeze the battery. Jin, help me trace back these wires, make a list of where each of them goes to. Boat! Thank you. Did you get them all to the boat? Yeah, everybody's safe. Are they coming closer? They fixed the engine, and they're gonna get as close to the island as they can without hitting the reef, so the next trip shouldn't take so long. I'm just gonna get some water, and I'll come back in a minute. Okay, I'll get the next group ready to go. Thank you. - Dan! - Yeah? Thanks for helping us. Absolutely. Okay, let's go! Uh, who told you you could eat those peanuts? May... May I eat these peanuts? I'm gonna keep my eye on you, shorty. Miles. Somethin' wrong with your neck? Follow me, please. Dan, you're back. What's wrong? I'm leaving in ten minutes to take the next group of people to the freighter. You need to make se that you're with me on that raft, all right? Well, don't worry about me, 'cause I'm gonna stay. Miles, no, uh, uh, I don't think I'm getting across the direness of the circumstance. Oh, no, you're very dire, but I'm still gonna stay. Hey, ten minutes. Yep. I'm surprised you wanna leave. Sorry? It's just weird. You know, after all that time you spent trying to get back here. What do you mean, get back here? What do I mean? How deep is the station? Deep. Is this the magic box? No, john, it's not. What is all this stuff for? Same things that all the dharma stations are for. Silly experiments. What kind of experiments? You know what, john? Why don't you watch this very informative video that will answer some of your questions? And I'll take care of some business. Hello. I'm dr. Edgar halliwax. And this is the orientation film for station six of the dharma initiative. As you've no doubt surmised, station six, or "the orchid, " is not. A botanical research unit. The unique properties. Of this island have created a kind of casimir effect, allowing the dharma initiative to conduct unique experiments in both space and time. This. Is "the vault, " constructed adjacent to a pocket of what we believe. To be negatively charged "exotic matter. " Great care must be taken to avoid leaving inorganic materials. inde the chamber. The electromagnetic energy within the island can be highly volatile and unpredictable. Now for your own safety and the safety of those around you, metallic objects must never. Be placed within the vault. In our first demonstration, we will attempt to shift the test subject 100 milliseconds ahead in four-dimensional space. For the briefest. Of moments, the animal will seem to disappear, but in reality. Hey. Was he talking about what I think he was talking about? If you mean time-traveling bunnies, then yes. You do know that he said specifically not to put anything metal in here. You expecting someone? May I have my weapon back? Sayid! Kate! Good to see you, dude. He say somethin' to tick you off, freckles? Didn't kill that one. Well, which one did you kill? Where's the baby? He's with sun, and they should be at the freighter by now. Are you okay? I am now. Hey, kenny rogers. What you trying to do there, pick a lock? You got a better idea? Hacksaw. For the handcuffs, right? Ok - Take it easy. - All right, all right. Sayid, how'd you get back? I took the zodiac from the freighter. Is it safe? A body from the boat washed up on the beach. It's safe now. All right! Let's get the hell outta here! Let's go, freckles. I've seen enough of this rock. After we drop everyone off at the boat, we can come back and look for claire, right? Absolutely. Hands and feet inside the vehicle! Let's go for a ride! Properties of this island have created a kind of casimir effect. I know you're down here, ben. Crouching in the dark, just waiting to take a shot at me. This. Is "the vault". Well, you better aim for the head, ben! You know, like your boyfriend who shot me in the back like a coward! This body armor's, um, been known to take a bullet or two in its time. But before you take your shot, ben, let me tell you about this. See that? I took out a bit of a-a life insurance policy, ben. It's a heart rate monitor, and it's connected to a radio transmitter. W-we call it a "dead man's trigger, " ben. If my heart stops beating. It sends a little signal to the 500 pounds of c4 that I've got hardwired out there on the freighter that'd kill a lot of innocent people, ben. If you think I'm bluffing, need I remind you of, uh. How your daughter oked as she bled out? Facedown in the grass? Who the hell are you? My name is john locke, and I have no. Conflict with you. And neither do the people on that boat. So. Why don't you put your knife down? We can talk about this. Well, john locke. I've never really been one for talk. You killed my daughter. You killed my daughter! Ben! Ben! Ben, stop! No, no! Stop! Ben, what did you do? You just killed everybody on that boat. So? Hey, charlotte! Listen, uh, I wanted to say before you get on the boat, please... I'm gonna stay, daniel. For now, anyway. Charlotte. There is no "for now. " If you don't come with me, "for now" could be forever. Nothing's forever. Why? Would it make any sense if I told you I was still looking for where I was born? N-no. Good-bye, daniel. Let me guess. You're not coming. I promised I wouldn't leave until I got everyone here safely off this island. Relax. I'll still be here when you get back. Right, right. When I get back. Okay. Everybody ready? Let's get started. Off we go. I think I might have something. Okay, so. So if. If I cut this wire, it. It should disconnect the firing mechanisms. Stop! No good. Damn it! I-I just don't know enough. H-how do we even know your little freezing trick's doing anything? We'll know if that light turns red and we're still here. How much stuff do we have left? We got a quarter tank. What happens if we can't deactivate the bomb? We better get everybody the hell off this boat. What's the matter? We're losing fuel. What? We're losing fuel! Look outside! Tell me if you see anything! We have a fuel leak! A bullet must have pierced the tank! We gotta find a place to set her down! No, don't land! - What? - There's no fuel on the island! We've gotta get to the boat, or this chopper's useless! I'm telling ya, I don't see the boat! Well, then keep looking! We gotta get every ounce of extra weight off this chopper now! Anythi that's not bolted down, toss it out! Now what? Is that enough? Can we make it? I'd feel a hell of a lot better if we were a few hundred pounds li ter! Well, if we don't maket, we're still close enough to ditch it on the beach. Hey! Do not go back to the island! We might not have a choice, doc. Hey. Why are you telling me this? Just do it, freckles. Sawyer! Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to bother you. But do you have the time, please? Yeah. It's eight fif... Hello, hurley. I think visiting hours are over, dude. This isn't a visit. I want you to come with me. Come with you where? Somewhere safe. And why would I go anywhere with you? I haven't seen you in, like, forever. Because circumstances have changed. What circumstances? Bentham's dead. What? Two days ago. What happened? They said it was suicide. What do you mean, they "said" it was suicide? And why are you calling him "bentham"? - His name is... - don't say it. We're being watched. Dude, I've been having regular conversations with dead people. The last thing I need now is paranoia. I just killed a man who's been perched outside this facility for the last week. I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive. We're not going back, are we? No. Just somewhere safe. Okay then. Hold on a sec. Checkmate, Mr. Eko. Where's the freighter? I don't know. I stayed on course. They must have it on the move again. How much fuel? Four, five minutes worth, unless somebody else wants to jump. As soon as we get to the boat, we'll go back for him. There it is! The boat! I see it! Behind us! Ben, help me. If he dies, everybody on that boat dies. That's not my problem, john. Hang on, man. Hang on! Wherever you go. Widmore. He'll find you. Not if I find him first. No. No. You two need to go now. Get everybody off the boat. We have maybe five minutes left in the tank. Go! You go. Go. I stay. Oh, bloody hell. Don't land! You can't land! Don't land! Don't land! There's a bomb! There's a bomb! Get away! There's a bomb! You can't land! Go back! Did he say "bomb"? Don't land! What are you doing? I don't care what the hell he's screaming! I'm flying on fumes! I gotta put this bird down! No! Don't land! No! No! Look, you don't understand! Jin and michael are doing everything they can, but there's no time! You've gotta get off the boat now! How long till we can fly again? Somebody patch the other hole where the bullet came out! Give it to me. I'll do it. Here! Somebody pump some gas! I'll handle the fuel. Get that life raft right there! Come on! Let's go! Hey, sun! Sun! Where you going? We gotta go. Jin's below with michael. - I can't... - no,no,there's no time! - There's no time.We have to go. - I won't leave him! Okay. You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get jin. All right? Just keep pumping till I get it started! That'll be enough to get us to the island. Jin, you gotta go. There's nothing more we can do, man. - No,I can find... - hey,come on. It's over. I'm almost out of this stuff. Listen, you are a father now. Get to yr wife and get her home. Thank you, michael. You're welcome. Go. Hey! Not yet! Your buddy said we got five minutes as of three minutes ago. If you're going, this is it. Let's go! - Kate!Come on! - Jin's still inside! Jin's still inside. We can't leave him behind. Come on. Listen, I'm not leaving without you. We gotta get out of here now. Let's ! Give me a minute! No! Wait! Where's jin? It's jin! No! Jin! Jin! We have to go back! Turn around! We can't do it! We have to! We need to go back! You can go now, michael. Who are you? Jin! Jin! We have to go find jin! Sun, there's nobody down there! You can't see anything from here! - We didn't get enough fuel!We can't go back! - Go lower! - I know he's there! - Sun,I'm...sun,I'm so sorry. - He's not... - he's down there! - I know he's down there! - we gotta go! No! I'm not leaving him! - can't get to him! - No,we're not leaving him! We're not! Turn back around! Sun! Sun! It's gone! He's gone. Lapidus! Fly us back to the island. You got it. No! No! No! No! Hello hello! someone wants to talk to you! Say hello to your mother JIYEON mama mama hello my love where are you? I'm in London I leave tonight just finishing a little business fly safe *** all right, guys. Thanks. Excuse me. Mr. Widmore? Yes. I'm sun kwon. Mr. Paik's daughter. I'm the managing director of paik industries. Yes, of course. How is your father? Excellent, thank you. Quite the golfer. I believe I owe him dinner after our last game. Are you really going to pretend that you don't know who I am? I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, ms. Kwon. Yes, you do know, Mr. Widmore. Just like you know we've been lying all this time about where we were and what happened to us there. You and I have common interests. When you're ready to discuss them. Call me. As you know, we're not the only ones who left the island. Ms. Kwon? Why would you want to help me? Why? "Why" what? Why did you kill him when you knew it would destroy the boat? Well, john, I really wasn't thinking straight. Sometimes. Good command decisions get compromi d by bad emotional responses. I'm sure you're gonna do a much better job of separating the two than I ever did. What are you doing? I asked you a question! If I were you, I'd duck. I better change. Nice day for a swim. What are you doing here? Decided to take a dip. Whatcha cebratin'? I'm not celebrating. Is that our boat? It was. What's that for? I'm going somewhere cold. Then where is mine? You don't need one because you're not going with me. Yes, I am going with you. No, john, you're not. Jacob told me what we had to do. - You don't get to make all the decisions... - he told you what to do But he didn't tell you how but he didn't tell you how because he wants me to suffer the consequences. What consequences? Whoever moves the island can never come back. So I'd like you to get on the elevator, john, and go back up. Richard and my people will be waiting 2 miles east of the orchid. Waiting for me? Ready, willing and able to share what they know. And then they will follow your every word. Good-bye, john. I'm sorry I made your life so miserable. What do I tell 'em to do? You'll find your way, john. You always do. Hello, john. Welcome home. I hope you're happy now, jacob. Yeah, what is that? Where's the island? Where's the island? Where the hell's the island? It's gone. Where the hell am I gonna land this thing? There's another smaller island close by they took us to! I got news for ya, doc there's nothing but water in every direction! Doesn't matter now. That's it, people! We're out of fuel! Get your life vests on! We're going in! Brace yourselves! Desmond! The life raft! Hold on! Where's jack? Kate!

Don't you dare bring him back. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -is he okay? -He's fine. It's a miracle. I can't believe he did it. Who did what? Locke. He moved the island. No, he didn'T. Oh, really? 'Cause. One minute it was there, and the next it was gone, so. Unless we, like, overlooked it, dude, that's exactly what he did. But. If you've got another explanation, man, I'd love to hear it. God almighty. There's a boat. There's a boat out there! There's a boat out there. Hey! Over here! Does it see us? I think it does! It is turning? It's turning! We're gonna have to lie. What? We're gonna have to lie. Lie about what? Everything, all of it, every moment since we crashed on the island. Jack. Now I know I'm new to this group and everything, but isn't this the place where everybody starts jumping up and down and hugging each other? Your freighter. Those men came to the island to kill us, all of us. You said that our plane was discovered on the btom of the ocean. Well, someone put it there... Someone who wants everyone to think that we're dead. So what do you think's gonna happen to us when we tell them that that wasn't our plane? What do you think's gonna happen to the people that we left behind? Jack, we can'T. We can't pull it off. Just let me do the talking. Dmor throw them a rope! Take them 'round to the stern! Neh! Aqui! D? Uma olhada aqui! H* uma jangada dos povos, Penny? Penny! Penny! -are you okay? -I'm...I'm fine.I'm fine. H-how did you find me? Your phone call. I have a tracking station. I love you, penny. And I'll never leave you again. This is... This is penny. This is, um, kate and then aaron. And this is sun, sayid, hurley. This is frank. And jack. Jack, this is... this is penny. It's nice to meet you, penny. But we need to talk. One week later What's this place called? Membata. Membata. Why are we doing this, dude? Sailing 3, 000 miles to another island? Because it's the only way to keep them safe. How long till we'll hit land? Well, if the wind's not too brutal. Eight, nine hours. Just long enough to give you a nice, convincing sunburn. It's been a pleasure, frank. I hope we never see each other again. Roger that, doc. Bye, sweetheart. Are you sure about this, brother? Are you sure? As long as I've got penny. I'll be fine. Don't let him find you, desmond. I'll see you in another life, brother. Aye. I guess you will. All right. Let's go home. Sleeping on your belly you break my arms, you spoon my eyes been rubbing a bad charm with holy fingers gouge away you can... niffles hello, jack. Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. Did he tell you that I was off the island? Yes, he did. When did you speak to him? About a month ago. -And kate? -Yeah. Yeah, he came to see her, too. And what did he y to you? He told me. That after I left the island, some very bad things happened. And he told me that it was my fault for leaving. And he said that I had to come back. Yes, I heard that you've been flying on passenger planes. Hoping that you'd crash. It's dark, jack, very dark. Why are you here? I'm here to tell you that the island won't let you come alone. All of you have to go back. Are you. Sayid... I don't even know where sayid is. Hurley. Is insane. Sun blames me for. And then kate. She won't even talk to me anymore. Perhaps I can help you with that. This is the way it has to be, jack. It's the only way. You have to do it together, all of you. How? I have a few ideas. Jack. I said, all of ou. We're gonna have to bring him, too. -=www. Ydy. com/bbs=- Proudly Presents</font> -=www. Ydy.
