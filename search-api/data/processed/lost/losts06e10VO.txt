You... didn't declare this. Sir, you're gonna have to come with me. - I told you people, I don't know anything! - Dude, just calm down! Why did you follow me?! Your wife sent me! There's something we have to do. She said you have to stop the man in black. You have to stop him from leaving the island. What's on Hydra Island? A plane. The same plane that brought your friends back. So I want you to go over there and do some recon. Who are you? Put your weapon down! Take me to your leader. So why don't you tell me what brought you over to this island? John Locke sent me. Well, here's the deal, chief. I'll go back over there and tell him the coast is clear, that I didn't find anybody. Then I'll bring the old man right to your doorstep. And what do you want in exchange, James? You give us safe passage off the island. Want some cocoa? Where'd you find cocoa? I didn't. Pretend. How's the leg? Still hurts. You should leave the bandage off for a while. The air'll do it some good. I'll try that. You mind if I sit down? I know you and I haven't had time to talk, but I was wondering if James had filled you in on what I showed him at the cliffs. You mean the cave. The one with the names on the wall. Most of the names have been crossed off now. There are just a few left. "Kwon" is one of them. Does that mean me or Sun? Well, Jin, I'm not sure. But what it does mean is that the only way we can leave the island is if all the names that haven't been crossed off go together. But Sun's not here. You just take care of that leg. I'm workin' on it. All right, Mr. Kwon, here's your suitcase and your watch. Money? I'm sorry. Federal law says we have to confiscate your $25,000. - C-confiscate? - It means that if you want it back, you're gonna have to fill out the necessary paperwork. Uh... money. You can exit right over there, sir. May I help you? Paik. A reservation for Paik. Yes. I've got it right here. We've got a beautiful ocean view room for you on the 8th floor. Two room. Two. No marry. Oh. Kwon. Jin Soo Kwon. I'm sorry. I apologize. Yes, there is a separate room reservation for Kwon. Room 842. Here you go, sir. Miss. Paik, Mr. Kwon, welcome to Los Angeles. I'm leaving for a little while. I got an errand to run. When will you be back? Morning. Keep an eye on the camp while I'm gone. I don't feel anything. Excuse me? Anger, happiness... pain. I don't feel it anymore. Maybe that's best, Sayid. It'll help you get through what's comin'. What are you doin', Hoss? I'm getting out of here before that thing comes back. What thing? Locke. And you're just sitting around here, - listening to whatever he tells you. - I ain't listenin' to nobody. I already told you I have a deal with Widmore. So if you just calm... It doesn't matter who you have a deal with. I've waited long enough. I'm going to find my wife. - Find her where? - I'll go back to the temple. And if she's not there, I'll try the beach. But I will find Sun, so stop trying to... Go! Uhh! Aah! Uhh! Is this the guy? Yeah. Let's take him. Lost Season 6 Episode 10 "The package" Play your card, Captain. Now what? We wait. Wait... for what? For Richard to come back. You'll forgive my scepticism, but the last thing Richard said before he went stomping off into the jungle, was that we were all in hell, and he had no idea what we were supposed to do next. In fact, I would bet money we never see him again. Hugo will find him. He will track him down and bring him back. Unless Alpert's covered in bacon grease, - I'm not sure Hurley can track anything. - Hey. Don't talk about bacon. Jacob has never lied to me before. If he said Richard knows what to do, then Richard knows what to do. He'll come back. And until then, we wait. How are the tomatoes? Dead. I remember when you first planted this here. It feels like a hundred years ago. You don't believe Alpert's coming back, do you? I don't care if he comes back. What about us... being candidates? What about it? Hurley took me to a lighthouse. To Jacob's lighthouse. And... there was a mirror, and all around it, there were... there were hundreds of names written down. I don't care. I don't care about Alpert or being a candidate. Sun... There's a reason why we were brought... I don't wanna hear about how this is our purpose or destiny! I just want you to go away and leave me alone. Sun. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Bad day? What are you doing here? I found your husband. What? I promised you I would reunite you two. Took me a little longer than I thought it would. But he's with my people back at my camp across the island. I can take you to him right now. I don't believe you. You killed those people at the temple. Those people were confused. They were lied to. I didn't want to hurt them. Any one of them could've chosen to come with me. And I'm giving you that choice, Sun, right now. I would never make you do anything against your will. I'm asking you. Please. Come with me. Jin is waiting. Sun! Sun, wait! Miss. Paik. Hi. I'm, uh, Martin Keamy. I'm a friend of your father's. You mind if I come in? I believe you've got something for me. Hmm? Sun? Sun, can you hear me? What happened? You all right? I'm sorry, what? Sun, slow do. Tell me what happened in English. Who did this to you? Locke. Sayid. Sayid. Hey. What happened? We were attacked. By whom? I don't know. Where is Jin? Hey! Hey! Wow, that was weird, huh? Where am I? It's called room 23. The Dharma Initiative was doing experiments on subliminal messaging in here. But you know all about the Dharma Initiative, don't you Mr. Kwon? - Why did you bring me here? - Relax. You're safe. I'm leaving. Sorry. But we went to a lot of trouble getting you here of the other island. And I can't let you leave. What do you want from me? These are grid maps that... that the Dharma people used to identify pockets of electromagnetism. Whoever signed these could really help me out. Uh, I know... I know the writing's difficult to read, but... but it sure looks like it says, "Jin Soo Kwon." So... Is it you or isn't it? You want answers to your questions? Then get me your boss. I want to talk with Charles Widmore. Well, then you're in luck... Mr. Kwon. Because he'd like to talk to you, too. You a good swimmer? - Good enough. - Wrap this in plastic. You don't want it to get wet. We're taking the outrigger. Something wrong, Claire? Um... What... what you said to Jin... about the names on the wall. You told him you needed them all to get off the island. Yes, I did. Was, uh... was my name on the wall? No. Well, then it doesn't matter if I get on that plane, then. I mean, you don't need me. No, that's not true Claire. I need you. And there's plenty of room on that plane for all of us. Well, when we go home, Aaron's not gonna know me. Stranger to my own son, he thinks Kate's his mother. Is her name on the wall? No, Claire, it isn't... not anymore. But I need Kate. Why? Because I'm three people shy of getting off this island, and Kate can help me get these people on that plane. But once she does... then whatever happens, happens. What's up with the guns? You two going somewhere? We're taking a boat ride over to the other island. What do you need a boat for? Can't you just turn into smoke and fly your ass over the water? Do you think if I could do that, I would still be on this island? No, 'cause that'd be ridiculous. What the hell you going over there for, anyway? I thought you were trying to avoid Charlie Widmore. They took one of our people, James. So I'm going to get them back. Oh, this for me? Uh, this is really nice. Your bodyguard is supposed to give me some money. Where's Mr. Kwon? No English. Hmm? All right. Uh, sit down. I checked his room. He's not there. Check the bathroom. Come on. Let's go. Mr. Kwon, why don't you come and join us? Look, thank you for the watch, okay? But you're also supposed to give me an envelope with money in it... $25,000. Yeah? Stop that. I feel like I'm in a damn "Godzilla" movie. What's that guy's name? The, um... The Russian guy... speaks like, nine different languages. Uh, uh, Danny's friend. - Mikhail. - Mikhail. Can he speak Korean? - I think so. - Okay, go get him. Now put your damn clothes on. She says the money her father gave them was taken at customs. Mm, that's not my problem. She wants you to let them please go to the bank. They will get it for you. You take her to the bank. I'll take Casanova here to the restaurant. And then we'll meet there. What's he whining about? He wants you to promise, that you won't tell her father that they are involved. Oh, hey, don't worry about that. Okay. Your secret is safe with me. Okay? Just bring me the money, and then we can all live happily ever after, right? What? Oh, for the fourth time, I was gathering mangoes, and she was already unconscious when I found her. - Why won't you believe me? - Because you're speaking. You got a pretty decent-sized bump. Might be a slight concussion. You can understand what I'm saying, but you can only speak Korean. She hits her head and forgets English? Are we supposed to buy that? Asked the man who communes with the dead. It might be aphasia. It's, um, a condition that's caused by trauma and affects the language centre of your brain. But it's usually temporary. Sun. You're gonna be okay. What are you smiling about? Pack your bags. We're leaving. Don't move! Let me see your hands! Easy, friend. I come in peace. Do you know who I am? Charles Widmore. Do you know who I am? Obviously, you're not John Locke. Everything else I know is a combination of myth, ghost stories and jungle noises in the night. I think you know more than that, judging by these... pylons. Why did you come here? You took one of my people, Jin Kwon. I have no idea what you're talking about. A wise man once said that war was coming to this island. I think it just got here. Where exactly are we going, Richard? - Where's Locke? - What? You said he came to recruit you. Where did he say he'd be? Hydra Island. Which is exactly where you landed the plane - that you flew back here, right? - That's right. This... man wants to leave the island, and that plane's the only way he can do it. You wanna know where we're going? We're gonna stop him. This is your fault, isn't it? Sort of. How are you gonna stop him from getting on that plane? We have to destroy it. Why isn't she speaking English? She was hit on the head when she was running away from Locke. He came back here? What... what did he want? What did he say to you? You... you understand me? I don't think she wants to come. Miss. Paik would like to know if there is a problem. I'm sorry. I'm showing that your account was closed. The balance is zero. If she may ask, who closed the account, please? Looks like... her father. Mr. Woo Jung Paik had access. The funds were transferred to one of his other accounts at our main branch in Seoul. - Uhh! - Get in here. Let's get in. Come on, get In. What's going on? I bumped his head on the door. Oh, come on Omar. You gotta be more careful than that. I got this. And go get the Arab guy. Hey. I'm an Arab. Just go pick him up. Sorry about that. Omar's loyal, but he lacks attention to detail. You don't really understand a word I'm saying to you right now, do you? Nothin'? All right. Just hold still, okay? I'm gonna strap you in here. Just in case you figure out what's about to happen to you, I can't have you freaking out. I don't think you realize... how unhappy Mr. Paik was when he found out that you were doing his little girl. Well, you know that 25 grand that you were supposed to deliver? That was my fee for popping you. From what I hear, you know anyone who works for, Paik knows the cardinal rule... hands off the boss' daughter. But you... you couldn't resist her, could you? The heart wants what the heart wants. Thank you. I'm sorry. Some people just aren't meant to be together. What the hell were you thinking? I'm sorry. I know. I know we panicked. This was not supposed to happen for days. We had a timetable. See, he was leaving their camp. Well, you should have let him leave and taken him in the jungle. Well, maybe you should put a mercenary in charge instead of a geophysicist. What's done is done. I need you to get the package from the submarine and take it to the infirmary. Can you do that for me please, Zoe? Yeah, sure. Mr. Kwon. My deepest apologies for everything that's been done to you. - My name is... - I know who you are. Why did you bring me here? We searched the Ajira plane, discovered your wife's luggage and found this inside. I thought you might want to have it. Go ahead. Turn it on. Her name is, Ji Yeon. Your daughter. I understand you've never seen her before. I have a daughter, too. I know what it's like to be kept apart. I understand the one thing you want is to be reunited with your wife and daughter. But it would be short-lived if that... thing masquerading as John Locke ever got off this island. Your wife, your daughter, my daughter... everyone we know and love... Would simply cease to be. I came here to make sure that doesn't happen. How? Come with me. I think it's time for you to see the package. What package? It's not a "what." It's a "who." Who are you? No English. I don't know why you're here, and I don't really care. No! Free. Free! Free. Good luck. Martin Martin? Who did this to you? Look behind you, you idiot. I brought you a couple of things. I was thinking about a patient that I had during my residency. Car crash, banged his head. When he woke up, he couldn't talk. The guy was frustrated. I mean... who wouldn't be? And then one of the nurses said, "just because he can't speak doesn't mean that he can't write." Think you could give it a try? It'll take a little longer to get your point across, but at least you have your voice back. I went back out to your garden to see if he was there. He wasn't, but... then I found this. That's one stubborn tomato. Guess no one told it it was supposed to die. Don't worry about it. You're not the first person to tell me to leave them alone. Locke... What did he say to you? Why didn't you go with him? Do you trust me? Sun... come with us, and I'll help you find Jin. I'll help you find him, and I'll get you both on that plane and as far away from this island as you can get. I promise. Where'd you go? What? Looked like your brain took a little stroll. Why aren't you worried, James? I am worried. Just really good at pretending I ain't. But I got a feeling this is almost over. 'Cause if Locke rode over there on the boat with Sayid, then Charlie Widmore blew him right out of the water. And what if he didn't? Well, then we're screwed six ways from sun... Oh, hell. He's alone. Thought you went over there to find Jin. They said they didn't have him. - And you believed that. - No. Where's Sayid, Did you lose him, too? When you over there, James, you mentioned that Widmore had someone guarding a room on his submarine... guarding something that he didn't want you to see. Yeah, so? I don't like secrets. Okay, come on. All right. Hey, be careful with him. All right. Okay. The guy can hardly stand. Well, what do you expect? Oh! How much did you give him? Obviously, I gave him too much. But, we needed him knocked out for the trip. I'm not a nurse. Come on. Get him up. Let's go Mr. Hume. Be careful. Come on.
