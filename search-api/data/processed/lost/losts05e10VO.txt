- A hostile. - What's your name? - Ben. Take me with you. If that's what you really want, Ben. If that's what you want. I want you to think about that. And you're gonna have to be very, very patient. You wanna protect your friends or not, Sayid? I'm Sayid Jarrah, one of the Oceanic Six. Stop right there! Sayid? Jin. Shut up! Get down. Say another word, and you're dead. I brought you a sandwich. Are you a hostile? - Do you think I am? - What's your name? Sayid. I'm Ben. It's nice to meet you, Ben. Hey, Phil. Hey. I brought another sandwich for him. Chicken salad this time. Yeah, I don't think it's the menu. He's not eating. Save yourself the trouble, kid. But Horace told me to. Why does he care so much? The guy's a hostile. - That doesn't mean he's not hungry. - Whatever. I brought you a sandwich. And a book. I read it twice. It's good. Thank you. Did Richard send you? Richard. He's your leader, right? It's just a camera. They can see, but they can't hear. Four years ago, I ran away into the jungle, and Richard found me. I said I wanted to leave, that I wanted to join you. So I've been patient. And if you're patient, too, I think I can help you. Lost SO5E10: "He's Our You" How'd it go? He tried to bribe me. - It didn't work. - Of course it didn't. Where to now? Nowhere. - You're done. - What do you mean, I'm done? We're done. Andropov was the last one. You've taken care of everyone who posed a threat to your friends. It's been a pleasure working with you, Sayid. So that's it? I killed all those people for you, and now you're just... w- walking away? You didn't kill them for <i>me,</i> Sayid. You're the one that asked for their names. There's no one else in Widmore's organization that we need to go after. Congratulations. Mission accomplished. What do I do now? I suppose you should go live your life. You're free, Sayid. Put out your hands. Come on. Thank you. It's nice to finally hear your voice. I'm Horace. Now's the part where you tell me <i>your</i> name. I need you to tell me what you were doing out in that jungle. - Ask him about the model. I- - Radzinsky. I got this. Those handcuffs- Are you having some kind of problem with your people? Because either you were in some kind of disagreement, which makes me wanna help you, or you're a spy trying to infiltrate us. So which is it? Okay. I'm gonna give you an hour to decide whether you wanna talk to me. But if you decide you don't want to... then I'm gonna have to take this to the next level. I think your bacon's ready. Oh. I forgot. What's on the TV? It's over, isn't it? What's over? This. Us... playing house. All of it. I never actually thought they'd come back. So they're back. Nothing's changed. What if Sayid tells them who he is? Sayid ain't sayin' nothin'. Hey. I got this under control. Morning, H. - Jim. - What's up? - Juliet. - Horace. I just spoke to the prisoner. We have a problem. - Why? What'd he say? - Nothing, which is what worries me. We need to find out why he violated the truce, why the hell he would come into our territory. I'm just gonna have to have Oldham do his thing on him. That psychopath? No way! What choice do I have? Just let me have go at him alone. Be my guest, but I'm telling you, man, he is not gonna talk. Oh, he'll talk to <i>me. </i> - Mr. LaFleur. - Take your lunch, Phil. You going back there alone? Take your lunch, Phil. Yes, sir. How you doing? A 12-year-old Ben Linus brought me a chicken salad sandwich. - How do you <i>think</i> I'm doing? - Sweet kid, huh? How can you live with him here? 'cause I ain't got a choice. Is that so? Let's see how <i>you</i> feel after 3 years of living in the '70s. Lucky for you... I spent that time getting myself in a position to save your ass. I'm sorry, Sayid. - What are you doing? - When I tell them I got your confession, I need them to believe that you didn't give it up easy. What confession? We're gonna say you were trying to defect. You were gonna offer some intel on the others In exchange for living with us. And why in God's name would I want to do that? What the hell else am I supposed to do with you? Let me go. And <i>then</i> what? I can't just let you go. Why not? Because these people trust me. I've built a life here, and a pretty good one. I let you go, all that goes away. So you got yourself a choice, chief. Either you cooperate and join the party in Dharmaville, or you're on your own. Then I guess I'm on my own. Fresh off the griddle. And don't forget to try the dipping sauces. They really bring out the ham. Thanks, Hurley. So... What's going on with Sayid? Don't know anything yet. What do you mean, you don't know anything? I thought you were at Sawyer's last night. What did he tell you? He told me to leave him alone and let him do his job. And you're going to? I'll talk to Juliet, see what she can tell me. Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you anything, why would Juliet? - Well, why wouldn't she? - 'Cause they're together. - What do you mean, they're together? - "Together" as... They live together. Like, not as roommates. You know, "together" like you guys were. I thought it was kind of obvious. - I mean, who couldn't see that comin'? - Hurley. Well, I guess I better... Go make some more waffles. Did <i>you</i> know? Yeah. Hmm. You know what I can't figure out? Is how the hell you got caught. You hostiles are supposed to be the kings of the jungle. And how dumb are you that you got captured by these idiots? And yet <i>you're</i> the one who mops up after them. Yeah, well... We'll see how cute you are once Oldham gets done with you, pal. What the hell are you doing here? I was bringing you a sandwich. A sandwich? You never made me a sandwich in your life. Yeah, well... I- I made one for myself... Uh-huh. So... So I just thought that I'd bring you- Oh, yeah? You just... - Dad, don't! - Don't you lie to me. What are you doin' down here? You made this sandwich for <i>him,</i> didn't you? - Hmm? - Yes. - Who told you to do that? - Nobody. - Nobody? - I just thought that- You "just thought," huh? Go home. Go on. I'll tell you what to think. How did you find me? I looked. What do you want, Ben? John Locke is dead. I think he was murdered. Why would anyone kill him? I'd say it was retribution for the work you and I have been doing. So you're in danger, Sayid. If I can find you, so can the people that found Locke. The same people who, even as we speak, are sitting outside Hugo's mental institution. They're watching him? A man in a sedan has been there all week, just waiting... presumably for you or me to show our faces. And that's why you're here? You actually came all this way to suggest that I kill this man? You don't <i>want</i> to? What makes you think I <i>want</i> to? Because, Sayid... to put it simply, you're capable of things that most other men aren't. Every choice you've made in your life, whether it was to murder or to torture, it hasn't really been a choice at all, has it? It's in your nature. It's what you are. You're a killer, Sayid. I'm not what you think I am. I don't like killing. Well, then I apologize. I was mistaken about you. All right, last chance. Take him to Oldham. # I can't give you # # anything # # but love # # baby # # that's the only thing # # I've plenty of # Oldham. # baby # Hey, man. Are we ready? # dream a while, scheme a while # # you're sure to find # # happiness # # and I guess- # Who is that man? He's our <i>you. </i> Better put him in the restraints. They're for your protection. There are side effects to what I'm giving you. Open his mouth. Open up. Don't be afraid. Just turn your mind off. Let it take effect. It's beyond your control, so fighting it is a poor use of your energies. You see, whether you struggle or not, one thing's for sure, friend. You <i>will</i> tell us the truth. There's somebody- somebody here in Los Angeles. - Let me take you to them. - Who? The same person that's gonna show us - how to get back to the island. - Is that what this is about? This is insane. You are all crazy. Sayid, where are you going? I don't want any part of this. And if I see <i>you</i> again, it'll be extremely unpleasant for us both. Do you have a menu? There you go. Sir? Another MacCutcheon? Please. What's that run you? Excuse me? That scotch. What's a glass of that run you? Whatever it is, it's worth it. I don't understand why someone would pay 120 bucks for a glass of anything. If you knew what my drink cost, why did you ask me? Same reason I'm eating my dinner here instead of a table. I'll have the rib eye, bloody. Yes, ma'am. Rib eye, bloody. Are you a professional? A professional what? You think I'm a prostitute? Mm. I'm not a professional anything. I just... Thought you looked sad. I like sad men. I'm sorry to hear that. So... Other than drinking alone at bars... what do you do? For a living. I'm between jobs at the moment. So what <i>did</i> you do? The only thing I was ever good at. Then why did you quit? I'm trying to change. I know why you're sad now. Do you? When you are that good at something, there are always going to be people who tempt you into staying the same. And how do you know so much about temptation? Buy me a glass of that scotch, and I'll tell you. Hello there. Hello? I'm going to ask you a few questions. I want you to relax and answer them truthfully... Not that you'll have any choice about it. What is your name? Sayid. Sayid Jarrah. All right, Sayid. Why were you in handcuffs when we found you? Because... because I am a bad man. Were you running away from your people? What people? The hostiles. I am not a hostile. Then where did you come from, Sayid? I came on a plane. What plane? Ajira flight 3-1-6. And that's how I returned to the island. "Returned"? You've been here before? Oh, yes. The first time, I was on Oceanic flight 8-1-5. It crashed. I was here for a hundred days. Then I left. Ask Sawyer. - Who's "Sawyer"? - Who cares?! None of this matters. Ask him about the Flame. Quiet. What do you know about our stations here? I know the Flame was a communication station. The Pearl was to observe other stations. The Swan was to study electromagnetism. But, of course, that was before the incident- The swan?! How could he know what we were gonna name it? We haven't even built it yet! I <i>told</i> you! He saw the model! - You see?! He <i>is</i> a spy! - Hey! I knew it! Radzinsky! I'm not gonna tell you again. Cool it. You're all going to die, you know. What? You're going to be killed. How exactly would you know this, Sayid? Because I am from the future. Maybe I should've used half a dropper. Oops. You... You used exactly enough. Bench grinder, lube equipment, drill press over here. Plugs, bearings, sockets, ratchets here. How are you with a flat four engine? You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you? No, not really. It's okay. Jack told you about us... No. Hurley, actually. It's kind of a relief, actually. I wasn't quite sure how to do it without it sounding like I was telling you to stay away. It's fine. All right... What do we do with him? We kill him. Hold on a second. We're not killing anyone, right? He violated the truce. What do you think <i>they</i> would do if they caught one of <i>us?</i> Since when did we start acting like them? - We're civilized. - Yes, we are. We have a rule of law. And we've given him every opportunity to defend himself. Blah, blah, blah. Need I remind you, this man's <i>seen</i> things? He <i>knows</i> things. There's nothing to talk about. - He's a spy. - You sure about that, Stu? He was trying to escape from the hostiles. He obviously has problems with his people. Yeah, and sharing our secrets are the quickest way for him to solve those problems. Okay, I'm gonna need a little more time to consider. Consider? I mean, the longer he's among us, the-the more danger we're in. I can talk to him, Horace. I just need more time. No, you <i>had</i> your chance, LaFleur! Why are we on <i>your</i> clock, Radzinsky? Horace, you've got to call for a vote. Either we make a decision, or I call Ann Arbor... and they make it for us. Radzinsky's right. Horace, please... I can't... I can't sleep with one eye open. We have a baby now. We have to think about Ethan. We have to think about all the children here. How are we going to feel safe with this man around? I don't know what he's up to, but we can't keep him here. We have no choice. Okay. Let's put it to a vote. All in favor of Radzinsky's solution, raise your hand. LaFleur? I would really like to say it's unanimous. Mmm. Just for the record, I really was just there for dinner. Are you afraid I'll get the wrong idea? Mmm. I think it's too late for that. Take it off. You so much as flinch, and you're dead. So who are you? You asked me earlier if I was a professional. I am a professional. I was hired to bring you to Guam. Who hired you? The family of Peter Avellino- the man you killed in cold blood last year on a golf course in the Seychelles. - You're a bounty hunter? - Doesn't matter what I am. You're going to answer for what you've done. Hit me in the face. What? Go on. You owe me one anyway, so make it a good one. Then I want you to take these keys out of my pocket and let yourself out. The guard outside is Phil. He's a dimwit, so I reckon you can get his gun before he even realizes you're out. Just promise me you won't shoot him. I appreciate the offer, but I'm fine right here. They're gonna kill you. They just took a vote. Even the new mom wants you dead. I'm going to stay here, James. This morning, you were begging me to let you go. - Why would you change your- - Because... when I woke up in the jungle and I realized I was back on this island... I felt there was no purpose to it. But now I know exactly why I'm here. To get shot? <i>Then</i> what? You're out of your mind. Hey. Hi. Why'd you come back? What? Sayid just filled my ear full of some crap about his damn purpose, and I wanna know... Why'd y'all come back? Uh... Why, Kate? I don't know why everyone else came back. I just know why I did. What? What the hell?! Are you ok? Craig! Grab a wrench, open those valves. Get the hoses going. Okay. Erin, grab the fire gear! Bill, go help Craig. What the hell happened? Three years-no burning buses. Y'all are back for <i>one day... </i> Get on that hose. Man this hose! Push it out! All security! All security! This is LaFleur! We have a fire! Everyone get to building 15 <i>now!</i> Roger that. I'm on my way. What happened to your glasses? My dad. For bringing me the sandwich? I know. My father was a hard man as well. I really hate it here. If I let you out... will you take me with you, to your people? Yes, Ben, I will. That's why I'm here. Attention, passengers. Ajira Airways flight 3-1-6 to Honolulu and Guam... Are you sure we're going to Guam? Where else would we be going? Can I ask you a favor? Can we get the next plane? Why? I'm very superstitious when it comes to flying. I'll buy you a rabbit's foot at the gift shop. This is the plane we're taking. Sorry about the handcuffs, but at least we're in business. Hold up! Wait, please! Thank you for not closing it. What's he doing here?! No, no, he can't come! Hurley, hey, if you want to get back, - this is how it's gonna have to be. - Are you working for Benjamin Linus? - What? - Are you working for him? Who's Benjamin Linus? He's a liar, a manipulator... a man who allowed his own daughter to be murdered to save himself... A monster responsible for nothing short of genocide. Why would I work for somebody like that? I did. Hide! Jin? Sayid. What are you doing here? How did you get out? Sawyer let me go. They were going to kill me. What? Attention. The prisoner escaped. The hostile is no longer in custody. Be on the lookout. He could be armed. They don't know he released me. Please, Jin, I need to keep moving. Okay. Let me talk to him first. - LaFleur, it's Jin here. - Come in. Whoa! Where'd you learn to do <i>that?</i> Come on. We better go. He called LaFleur. You were right about me. What? I <i>am</i> a killer.
