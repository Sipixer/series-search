- Where did it come from? - Based on the maps inside, Nigeria. - Anyone on board? - Two men dressed as priests. - Priests? - Drug runners in disguise. The plane was loaded with heroin. No! No! No! Let him go! Kill him. Shoot him... now. Shoot him! Do it! What's your name, boy? What's your name, boy? Eko. Look at Mr. Eko. No hesitation. A born killer. Come. You won't need that anymore. Back! Back we go, back we go. What are you writing? Things I need to remember. Do you mind if I sit? Please. Thanks. So you're Eko, huh? - Yes. - Claire. And this is Aaron. Aaron? The brother of Moses. Yeah, that must have been tough to live up to, right? Pressure of everyone saying, "why can't you be more like your brother Moses?" Yes, I'm sure it was. Why did you choose it-- Aaron? I just liked it. Aaron was a great man. Moses had great difficulty speaking, so it was Aaron who spoke for him. So you're religious, huh? You should speak to Charlie. He doesn't want to admit he's religious, but he carries around a statue of the Virgin Mary. A statue? Yeah. He says he found it on the island. Weird, right? May I see it? Where did he find this? He said he found it in the jungle. Where in the jungle? - I don't know. - Where? Look, what are... it's just a statue. Just a statue? Where is Charlie? You breakin' in or breakin' out? I used to love those old silent movies where the robbers would crack a combination lock with their ear pressed up against a safe and the money they stole was always in a white bag with a big dollar sign on it. Silent movies, huh? You're not that old, man. Well, I'm old enough. Settin' the combination? With the new folks joining us, I figure we better limit people's access to the guns. Can't have just anyone who wants one walking in and helping themselves, which I'm guessin' is why you're here, Michael. Hey, Jin, do you like the kinks? Kinks? - Keens? - No, no. Kinks. Kinds with a "k" at the end. K-k-kink-kuh. K-kinks. You don't... It's a good tune, Jin. Oh, thank you very much, Jin. I do have a beautiful voice, don't I? Where did you find this? - What--what happened? - Where did you find it? In the jungle. I found it in the jungle. Take me there. This is not your business. I want you to take me to where you found it. Okay, fine. Yeah, we'll go for a stroll. There's nothing there. We'll go first thing in the morning, okay? We're going now. Okay. Let me go tell Claire so she doesn't get the wrong idea. Wait here. I-- Tell her on your way. Get us some beers. Go. - Where did you find this? - What does it matter? - The same in the other bag? - Yes. 50. 50 what? 50  is what I will pay you in exchange for the favor you are asking me to do. A favor? You have a large quantity of heroin in a country that has no poppies and no market for its sale. Your drugs are of no value here, so you must get them out. The borders are all guarded by the military, so you must fly, but as I am sure you are aware, the only private planes currently allowed into the air are either U.N. Aid or the catholic missionaries, and so you have come to me for a favor. I will buy your heroin for 50. It is true what they say about you. And what is that? You have no soul. No. Go. Go... and tell your friends I let you live... that Mr. Eko let you live. Just give me a second, okay? Hi... Claire. What happened to the statue? Oh, don't play stupid, Charlie. W hat? What's this? Because this was in your little statue, and unless I'm mistaken, I seem to remember you saying you were a drug addict. I didn't know. Look, if it's sealed up inside a statue, how would I know? Claire, I'm not using. Look. You believe me now? I don't... care. Someone's waiting for you. Got it? - Got it. - All right. Breath halfway out, and gently squeeze the trigger. Squeeze... Good. How'd you learn all this stuff? My dad used to take me hunting. Huntin' for what? Birds, mostly. Of course, birds don't shoot back. Yeah. I know people are talking, thinkin' I'm gonna go runnin' off after Walt again. If people are talkin', I'm not hearing it, but if I was, I'd say it's not a very smart plan. Yeah, it's not. Let's try one for real. Bravo. Well done with Claire, mate. You got me in a lot of trouble there, so thanks for that. I hope you're happy. Oh, that's right, you don't do happy. All right, well, we're here. I found it right here, right by that tree. -  You found it here? - Yeah. Found it here. You're a liar. Know what? I don't even know you. You asked to see where I found it. This is where I found it. We're done. Have an nice hike. You did not find the statue here. Take me to the plane. How'd you know about the plane, man? It's old, you know. Been out in the jungle for years. Of course, you would know that. You know everything. Why did you lie to the girl? What? You told her you did not know what was inside the statue. I wasn't lying. Then what is the wrong idea? What? When I showed you the broken pieces of plaster, you said you did not want her to get the wrong idea. What is the wrong idea? I don't have to tell you anything, man. You come traipsing across the island and what, suddenly now, you're in charge? You want me to take you to your plane? You best start treating me with some respect. I'm not just some guy you can just tr-- What? What? Let's go. Yes, sir. Sir-- sir,if you buy a statue, the money will buy polio vaccine for the village. 300 Naira, sir. What are you doing here? I have come to give my confession. Hello, Eko. Hello, brother. So I've come to visit you for the first time in three years and you won't hear my confession? You know, monsignor would have said he failed to raise a proper catholic boy. Well, why waste your time confessing? It won't help you. It won't? No, for confession to mean something, you must have a penitent heart. You and your guilt, Yemi. I've only done what I needed to do to survive. How is that a sin? You may live far from here, but that doesn't mean I haven't heard of who you are and what you have done. Have you forgotten how you got that cross, brother? The day they took me... is what I did that day a sin or is it forgiven, because it is you that was saved? Why are you here, Eko? I have come to help you. I have some merchandise that I need to get out of the country. I would like to use one of your church relief flights to transport it. "Merchandise"? You mean drugs. It is not my normal business, Yemi. We are moving the drugs out of Nigeria, so that they cannot be used by our people, and the money-- you have all the money to buy your vaccine. God has given us this opportunity. We should not turn our back on it. God did not bring you here, Eko. Your own greed did. Now I will always love you... but I will not help you. It's good to see you again, brother. A little close to the ear, Freckles. Sure you know what you're doing? Would you please turn your head? Why? You ain't got a clean enough shot at my neck? I can cut my own damn hair. You know, you don't have to be belligerent just for belligerent's sake. Everyone loves you now. Bullpuckey. Yo, Sawyer, glad you're back, man. Yo, yourself... Pillsbury. See? Hey, Kate... hey, Locke said you were on hatch duty later. I was wondering if, uh, you mind if I go instead? You want my shift? Help me take my mind off things. - Sure. It's all yours. - Thanks. Appreciate it. Glad you're okay, man. Yeah. Don't even say it. All right, time to take a break. We just had a break. I'm not what you think I am. And what do I think you are? It was my brother's fault. Sorry? It was his fault I became an addict. He started with the heroin. I tried to make him stop. You don't know me, man. I was a good person. I was an altar boy. All right, I knew what was in that statue, it doesn't mean I needed what was inside it, so don't judge me, man. - Don't-- - Shh. What? What's that? It's a parachute. That a priest? What are you doing? You  know that guy? Yes.  This man saved my life. Saved your life, huh? Sure, that makes sense. He takes off in a plane in Nigeria, we're out in the middle of the South Pacific. That makes all the sense in the world. This is scripture written here. You're a priest. You're a priest, right? He's a priest and you're a priest, too, right? I need to talk to you. I'm in the middle of confession. It cannot wait. Bless you. God be with you all and please come back in the morning. It's okay. How dare you come here and disrupt my work. Have you reconsidered? - What? - My request. Flying drugs under the cover of the church? How is that something I could ever reconsider? Look-- hey, don't touch those! I am going to make this easy for you. You make us priests and we will fly the drugs out ourselves. Make you priests? Just sign these ordination documents, and I will give you the money for the vaccines. Leave this church now, Eko. Go, now. Yemi, I understand that you live in a world where righteousness and evil seem very far apart, but that is not the real world. I am your brother and I would never do anything to hurt you, but my friends, if you do not do what I ask, they will burn this church to the ground. Is that worth less than the price of your name on a piece of paper? Think of the lives you will save. My signature does not make you a priest, Eko. You could never be a priest. How many of the statues do you have left, the Virgin Mary statues, how many? - Uh, 300. - I will take all of them. I guess we are both sinners now. Perhaps we are, but God will forgive me, Eko. Uh... I'm lost. It was dark. I was following Sayid. Right afterwards, a big bag of rocks fell on my head, so I'm sorry if I'm a bit spotty with the geography. Climb that tree. What? Climb that tree and perhaps you'll be able to get your bearings or see the plane. You climb it. What if I don't? You gonna beat me with your Jesus stick? I find it a little odd that your scripture stick has dried blood on it. Are you going to climb that tree or not? What kind of priest are you, anyway? You need to get higher. Wonderful. Thank you. Eko! Run! Run! Did you see it? Yeah, I saw it. What the bloody hell did you do? I did nothing. Most people, when they see a creature made of swirling black smoke, they run. I was not afraid of it. I can see that. That thing kills people. Did you see the plane? Yes, I saw your plane. It's about a kilometer that way. Thank you. Wait! Come on. Come on. Where are you? Hey, Michael. Hey. How you doing? I'm good. Thanks. You down here alone? Yeah. Hurley's supposed to be here, but, uh, I guess he's running late. Well, listen, uh... No one's forgotten about Walt. - What? - I can't... I don't have any idea what you must be going through, but I just want you to know that as soon as we can, we're gonna figure out a way to go out and bring him back. Yeah. Thanks, man. Thanks. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Well,  I'll leave you to it, then. Thanks. Eko. What are you doing here, Yemi? - I came to stop you. - Go back to your church. Do not get on that plane, Eko. You saved my life once. Now I'm here to save yours. Save my life? Look, you get on that plane, if you do this-- If I do what, Yemi? Are you a prophet now? Please, Eko. Let me take your confession. Anything I can do, I will do, but please, don't go. He told the military! You did this? I did not tell them who was involved. Just leave the drugs and come back with me. No! Stop! No more! Yemi! Yemi! Yemi! No! No! No! Help me get him! Father? Are you okay, father? Eko? Who's that? He is my brother. I'm sorry. For the one I broke. So are you a priest or aren't you? Yes. I am. "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, He leadeth me beside the still waters, He restoreth my soul, He leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake, yea, though I walk through the shadow of the valley of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over, surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Amen. Claire? You lied to me, Charlie. I know I did. I'm sorry. Just... it made me feel safer to have it around. Look, I can't have you around my baby, okay? Claire, I don't-- Charlie, I don't want you
