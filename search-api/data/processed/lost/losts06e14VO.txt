Mr. Locke, can you hear me? Welcome back. I know you. (chuckles) We were on the same flight back from Sydney. I met you in the baggage claim office. You had lost your knives. I'm Jack Shephard. What happened? You were run down by a car. You just came out of surgery. Am I... (inhales sharply) Am I all right? Your dural sac ruptured. But I think I got everything back were it belongs. Mr. Locke, while I was operating, I got a look At the initial injury to your spine-- The one that put you in the wheelchair. And I was hoping you could tell me how that happened. Why? Because I think you're a candidate. A candidate for what? A new procedure, A surgery we're developing, and... If it works, it could restore feeling to your legs. In fact, you may even walk again. If you'll give me a shot, Mr. Locke, I think that... That I could fix you. No, thank you. Well, now there's minimal risk, and--and the benefit could-- I said no, doctor. (door opens) (voice breaks) John? - Oh. - Oh, John. It's the first time they let me see you. Oh! (chuckles) - Are--are you okay? - I'm fine. Hi. - Are you his doctor? - Yes, I am. Dr. Shephard. Oh, thank you. (chuckles) Thank you. Thank you for saving him. (chuckles) Thank you. (surf rolling) (groans) Welcome to Hydra Island. At least you didn't have to paddle. Get in. Unh-unh. Ain't no way I'm gettin' back in those cages. - Well, I've got the gun, so you-- - Not anymore, doughboy. (gunshot) drop the gun! Put the gun down or I'll kill her! You ain't gonna kill anybody. Otherwise, you wouldn't be throwing us in a cage. I have a list of names. Ford, you're on it, As are Reyes and the Kwons. Kate Austen? She's not. It doesn't matter to me whether she lives or dies. Don't listen to him. (grunts) (cage door clanks) You may not believe it, But I'm doing this for your own good. You're right. I don't believe it.</i> Is the fence live yet? They're saying about an hour. We haven't got an hour. Tell them to work faster. He's coming. Sync by n17t01 Re-sync by honeybunny (whirring) Hello? Excuse me? - Hello? - Hmm? Oh! (whirring stops) I'm sorry. There was no one out front, And I heard the drill. - Do you know where I can find Dr. Nadler? - Well, you can find him right here. And if you're not a patient, you can call me Bernard. (chuckles) Hi. Jack Shephard. Um, I'm a surgeon over at st. Sebastian, And I was hoping to get a look at one of your patient files. And which patient would that be? His name's John Locke, and our records said That you had done some emergency oral surgery on him about three years back. - And what are you looking for, exactly? - I wanna know how he was hurt. Do you mind if I ask you why you're so interested in Mr. Locke, Jack? Um... He and I met about a week ago. We were on the same flight back from Australia. Oceanic 815. I sat across the aisle from you. If memory serves, You were flirting with my wife rose when I was in the bathroom. It's pretty weird, huh? Yeah. Well... Maybe you're on to something here, hmm? Now I can't break patient confidentiality And tell you something I shouldn't, But I can tell you that when I treated Mr. Locke,</i> There was another man in the same accident with him. Wait, that was...Three years ago. You just... Remember that? Of course I do, Jack. Anthony Cooper. Good luck, doc. I hope you find what you're looking for. What happened? There was a mortar attack. Widmore's people fired on us. Locke saved you. What about the rest of your group? What happened to them? The ones who weren't killed scattered into the jungle. It's just the three of us now. Why did he bring me here? Because your friends got themselves captured. And now... We're gonna have to rescue them. Rescue them from what? Widmore has them in a cage about a half a mile inland. - Why would he-- - You know, I would ask him, Except I don't think he's gonna give me a straight answer. But I can't imagine that his intentions are good. If we move right now, We can break your people out, run for the plane And be off this island before Widmore knows what hit him. They're not my people. And I'm not leaving the island. Well, Jack, I'm hoping you'll still change your mind about that. But your friends do want to leave.</i> And since they just ran away from me on my own boat, I'm gonna need your help convincing them that they can trust me. Why should I trust you? Because I could kill you, Jack, right here, right now. And I could kill every single one of your friends, And there's not a thing that you could do to stop me. But instead of killing you, I saved your life. And now I wanna save them, too. So will you help me? (birds chirping) You feel like we're runnin' in circles? Back in these cages... Except last time, the gun was to my head.</i> He wouldn't have killed me, James. That cave I told you about, Where all the names are written? Your name was there, too, But it was crossed out. He doesn't need you, Kate. So she's with your mother? Yes. You saw her pictures? How? Widmore's people found your camera on the plane. He showed me the pictures. Our daughter-- She's so beautiful. I have your ring. (laughs) (kisses) (generator powers down) Uh-oh. (man) What happened? (man speaking indistinctly) (man) Somebody shut us down? What's going on? Somebody killed the power. Get a team to that generator now! (leaves rustling) (rattling and growling) And we're dead. (gunfire) (man shouts indistinctly) (man) Go! Go! Go! (shouts indistinctly) (roars) Aah! Hey. I think I can reach the keys. (grunts) (groans) Hurry. When that thing's done with them, he's coming for us. Well, I ain't waitin'. Uhh! Damn it! (banging) (grunts) What are you doing here? (roars) I'm with him. Come on. (birds chirping) (Frank panting) How much further to the plane? I'd say about a quarter-mile, just over that ridge. So you're coming with us now? I'm gonna take you to the plane, but I'm not getting on it. I'm sorry, Kate. I'm... I'm not meant to go. Thanks for coming back for us, doc. Appreciate it. (footsteps approaching) No, it's okay. Sayid's with us. He was the one who turned off the generators. Great. The more the merrier. We need to go. Locke's waiting. Are you a relative of Mr. Cooper's? Uh, no. No, I'm not, but-- M-may I ask the nature of the visit? Um... Dr. Shephard? Hey. (chuckles) What are you doing here? Um, I'm here to see Anthony Cooper. Do you know him? Is that why you're here, too? What do you want with Anthony? I wanna talk to him about the accident that he was in with Mr. Locke. Um, Dr. Shephard... Just go. Look, all I wanna do is help him. I know. John told me about the operation. He doesn't want it. Why doesn't he want it? Please, Dr. Shephard, just leave this alone. You saved John's life. Why can't that be enough? Because it's not. (woman over p.A.) Housekeeping, dial 23.</i> Housekeeping, extension 23. (indistinct conversations) (Helen) Hi. This is Anthony Cooper. He's John's father. (man) Hey! Stop! (rifles cock) Stop right there! (snap, thud) (gunshot) (Frank) Well, all righty. Let's see what it'll take to get this baby to fly. Son of a bitch. His neck's been broken. That's because I broke it. If it's any consolation, Widmore knew that I would kill these men. What are you talking about? They were only guarding the plane for show. If Charles had really wanted to keep me from actually getting onboard, He wouldn't have moved his little fences. Well, wait. Now he wants us to leave the island?</i> No, Hugo. He wants to get us all in the same place at the same time-- A nice, confined space we have no hope of getting out of. And then he wants to kill us. - Kill us with what? - With this. 4 bricks of c4. I found 'em in one of the overhead compartments, Wired to the electrical system of the plane. If we would've turned it on... Boom. So what now? We can't be sure he didn't put more explosives on the plane. It's not safe. If we're gonna leave the island, I think we have to take the submarine. Well, that's what I've been sayin' all along. Dude, wait. He's not supposed to leave the island. - I mean, Alpert said-- - Screw Alpert. He ain't here. That's twice you've saved our asses. Guess I was wrong about you. Thank you, James. (Locke) that submarine is gonna be heavily defended. We're gonna need everyone. I'll help you, but like I said, I'm not going with you. Fair enough. Let's go. Hey. - I-I'm sorry that I... - That's all right, Claire. I understand why you went with them. (lowered voice) Hey, doc, listen up. You don't wanna leave this island, that's your own damn business. But I'm gonna ask you for one last favor. I don't trust that thing one bit, So here's what I need you to do. Once we get to the dock, You make sure it doesn't get on the sub. How am I supposed to do that? You saw what it did back there. Just get it in the water. I'll take care of the rest. Mm. (woman) C.T. test to trauma 3. C.T. test to trauma 3.</i> Mr. Locke, are you awake? Push the button. Mr. Locke, can you hear me? I wish you had believed me. (woman) Excuse me? Ms. Littleton? Wh-- Dr. Shephard. I-I was just looking for you. The, um, the lawyer told me you work here. (chuckles) Um, c-can we talk? Yes. Yes. (machine whirs) (thud) (coin rattles, clank) Oh. No. I'm okay. (chuckles) Sorry I had to run out Of the--the will reading the other day, - But I did have an emergency and... - Oh. N-no worries. (clears throat) Um, I know this is as awkward for you as it is for me. (chuckles) I never even met this man. Anyway, the, uh, the lawyer gave me this. She said, uh, there'd be more stuff to come, But that my father especially wanted me to have this. You know why or what it's supposed to mean? I have no idea. But then... I-I didn't know about you, either. Our father, uh... You mind--you mind if I ask how he died? He was found in an alley outside a bar in Sydney. He drank himself to death. I flew down to bring his body back, But then, uh... (sighs) the airline lost it. I just flew in from Sydney few days ago. When? Uh, last Wednesday. Oceanic flight 815? Uh... Yeah. Do you mind if I have a look at that? Um, sure. Go ahead. (instrumental version of "catch a falling star" playing)</i> I'm sorry. I-I wish I knew why he wanted you to have this. Yeah. Me, too. Well, um, it was nice seeing you again. Thanks for trying to help. Where are you staying? Uh, just down the road- a motel. Why don't you come stay with me? Stay with you? I mean, we're... We're strangers. (laughs) No, we're not strangers. We're... We're family. Just 'cause there ain't any goons on the dock Doesn't mean they ain't on the sub. We're going in hard. Got it? Lapidus, Hugo, Jin, Sun-- you're with me. The rest of you wait 30 seconds, head down the dock behind us. You think you two can get our backs? Absolutely. All right. (sighs) Let's go home. (gun clicking) (hatch clicks open, thuds) (creaks) (man over p.A.) After engine room, power the bilges. After engine room, power the bilges, please.</i> Where's the damn Captain? (speaking indistinctly) Put your damn hands up. (grunts) Nothin' personal. Okay, Hoss, how about you get ready to fire this thing up? I got it. Let's go. You sure you won't reconsider, Jack? Yeah, I'm sure. Whoever told you you needed to stay Had no idea what they were talking about. John Locke told me I needed to stay. What happened? (gunshot) Kate?! (gunfire) (groans) Aah! (grunts) Claire! <i>Let's go now!</i> (gunfire continues) (groans) (Kate groaning) What's going on up there? What happened? Widmore's people shot her. (groans) (gasping) Hurley, I need a first aid Kit. - Who else is up there? - Claire. (gunfire continues) Claire! James! (gunshot) Lapidus, if you can hear me, - Dive! Dive! - Let's go! (levers click, engines power up) - Hey! Wait, wait! - Claire, wait! - Wait! - Claire! What the hell are you doing? What we came here to do- leaving. - It's all right. It's all right. - No! They're leaving us! No, trust me. You don't want to be on that sub. - Claire? - Kate. - Claire? Where's Claire? - She's still up there. - No, we can't leave without her. We can't-- - Kate. Kate. - Is she gonna be okay? - Jack, I can't find the first aid Kit, dude. Jin--my pack. There might be a shirt in there I can use for pressure. It's okay. Just relax. Everything's gonna be all right. Here. Can you help her? I think the bullet went straight through... What? (Kate groans) Dude, where'd that come from? Locke. We did exactly what he wanted. - We have to get to the surface. - What the hell? We have to get to the surface now!</i> Lapidus, take us up. - We're divin'! - Just do it! You heard him. Up! (levers click) - Dude, how'd that get on the sub? - Locke put it in my pack. Why would he do that? He wanted to come with us. You're damn right he did. That's why I shut his ass out. He wanted you to shut him out. Any idea how that thing works?</i> - Can we turn it off? - This watch is jury-rigged to the battery. - The battery detonates the explosives. - How much time till we're up, Frank? At least five minutes. We ain't got five minutes. What's it gonna be, Sayid? These wires--they're leads from the watch. If we disconnect them from the battery, - Technically speaking, the bomb should be inert. - "Technically"? Yes, but you need to pull them out simultaneously, - And I'm not sure-- - Step aside. - No, wait. Wait. - What the hell are you doing, doc? Nothing's gonna happen. What? Don't pull those wires out. We're okay. Nothing's gonna happen. If I don't pull these wires, Locke's gonna blow us - To kingdom come. - No, he's not! Locke can't kill us. Uh... What? This is what he wanted. This is what he's been waiting for. Everything that he has done has been to get us here. He wanted to get us all in the same place At the same time- a nice enclosed space - Where we had no hopes of getting out of. - I don't understand. Locke said that he can't leave the island without us. I think that he can't leave the island unless we're all dead. He told me that he could kill any one of us Whenever he wanted, so what if he hasn't because he's... He's not allowed to? What if he's trying to get us to kill each other? Stay out of my way, doc. Now if he wanted that thing to blow up, Why would he put a timer in it? Why not just throw it inside? - I don't care. - Nothing is gonna happen. It's not your decision to make. - He can't kill us! - I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing! James... We are going to be okay. You just have to trust me. Sorry, doc, I don't. (clatter) (gasps) (Jack gasps) (metal creaks) Listen carefully. There's a well on the main island A half mile South from the camp we just left. Desmond's inside it. Locke wants him dead, Which means you're going to need him. Do you understand me? Why are you telling me this? Because it's going to be you, Jack. Sayid! (loud explosion) (metal creaking) (Frank grunts) (alarm sounding) (panting) (metal creaking) Oh, hell. Uhh! (alarm continues sounding) (Jack grunts) - Are you okay? - What happened? Did Sayid just... Help! - Sun! - Help! Wait! (crying) Hold on. I'll get you out. Jin! No! - Sawyer! I need help! - Jin! Hurley! (Jack) Hurley! You gotta take Kate outta here. - What about everybody else? - I'll take care of them! I have to go after Sayid! There is no Sayid! Listen to me. Take this tank And buddy-breathe and swim out where the blast hole, okay? Hurley, you can do this, okay? Okay. Go. (grunting) (gasping and crying) Doc! (wailing) push. On three. One... Two... Three. (Sawyer grunts) (creaking) (gasping) (metal creaking) (loud clanking) Sawyer! (Jin) Jack! Sawyer! Sawyer! (grunts) Sawyer. Jin... Go. - No. - Save yourself. I'm going to get you out of here. Go. Go. I'll get her free. No. We can do this! Just go! Save Sawyer. (Sun cries) Jin! Take this. I can get him out without it. No, you can't, Jack. Just go. Go. (grunting) Jin. You have to go. No, I can do this. No. No, you can't. (crying) Please go. I won't leave you. (grunts) I'm gonna get you out of here. Go. Go. Please. Go! I love you, Sun. I love you. (crying) (woman speaking indistinctly over p.A.)</i> Is somebody meeting you, Mr. Locke? Yes, my fiance, Helen. She's, uh... Probably stuck in traffic. Hey, I'll take it from here. You know, I'm pretty good at this. - Well, best of luck to you, sir. - Thank you. See ya. Mr. Locke. I'm glad I caught ya. I hadn't have a chance to say good-bye yet. Well, good-bye. (chuckles) And thanks again, Dr. Shephard. I went to see your father. W-what? When you didn't want the surgery, I felt like I had to understand why, and, uh, you know, I thought that if I could find out why you're in this chair, That maybe- I was in a plane crash. I had had my--my private pilot's license for a week, And, uh, I begged my father to be my first official passenger. He was terrified of flying. But I looked him right in the eye and I told him he could trust me. And we barely got off the ground. I-I still don't re-- I don't remember what I did wrong, But it was my fault. It was my fault</i> That this man who I loved more than anything Will never walk or... Talk or... You know, the first time you and I met, um, Back at the-- at the airport... You told me that my father was gone, And, uh, It hurt to hear that, but I knew you were right. Your father's gone, too, Mr. Locke. - Uh, no, no, he's not. - Yes, he--he is, And you can punish yourself as much as you want, And that's never gonna bring him back. What happened, happened, And... You can let it go. What makes you think letting go is so easy? It's not. In fact, I don't really know how to do it myself. And that's why I was hoping that... Maybe you could go first. (laughs) Good-bye, Dr. Shephard. I can help you, John. I wish you believed me. (coughs) Jack. (panting) (grunts) I couldn't find you. I couldn't find you. (coughs) - Is he okay? - He got hit in the head pretty hard, But he's breathing. What about Jin and Sun? (crying) (sighs deeply) (cries) (water lapping) It sunk. What, t-the submarine? But... They- -they were all on it. Everyone. - What they're-- they're all dead? - Not all of them. Wait. W-where you going?
