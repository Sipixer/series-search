I'm headed on a bearing of about 1-3-7 From the coordinates we pulled off our guy's map. But don't hold your breath. Magnetometer is picking up A hell of a lot of anomalies down here. A chest full of doubloons? Keep dreaming, ron. Let's swing around on the next bridge and recalibrate. Uh... are you getting this? What? what's up? It's... it's an airplane. Oh, my god. It's oceanic 815. This haunting footage comes to us From the"christiane i," A salvage vehicle in the indian ocean. For more than two months, It's been scouring the depths of the sunda trench off bali In search of the remains of sunken trading ships. Late last night, Two remotely operated vehicles, or r.o.v.s., That verified what The national transportation safety board Had long feared, that the commercial aircraft... How you want your eggs, dan? Disappeared after departing sydney, australia, On september 22nd, 2004... So what happened? they found that missing plane? This footage confirms that oceanic flight 815... Dan? did in fact crash at sea. Dan? even with this tragic discovery... Dan, why are you so upset? victims families say That they're left without any sense of closure. I don't know.

Naomi covered for us. They don't know what locke did to her. You sure about that? Okay, okay. So the boat hasn't heard from anybody else yet, but, uh, These are g.p.s. transponders, And my team and I are all wearing these. The transponders will send the locations back to the ship, And then the ship will send All the locations back into the phones.

There's a cabin I have to go to. But the cabin was back that way. What did you say, hugo? I, uh, Thought your were talking about the airplane cabin. Why are we wasting our time going to some shack anyway? because we're supposed to. Right, like you were supposed to throw a knife Into that naomi chick's back? You mind telling us who you're getting your orders from, Colonel kurtz? I got 'em from walt. Anything? No, but it's a big island. The freighter could be approaching from the other side. That's the spirit. Juliet, you lived amongst the others. Why would ben say The people coming here intend to do us harm? Because he's a liar and he's trying to scare us. That's what ben does. Or because the people coming here Intend to do us harm. How many guns do you have left? Hey. is that from your chopper? Yeah, yeah. that, uh, yeah, they... Reduced the weight load when we started going down. Ha ha. I guess that's why they pushed me out. What's this for? I'm not in charge of, uh, packing, so... Um... you're not, huh? We should, uh... you wanna keep moving? Hey, daniel, why did you bring the gun? Yeah... as a precaution. Precaution against what? Rescuing you and your people... Can't really say its our primary objective. Then what is? It's miles. It's miles. come on. What the hell do you mean you saw walt? In a dream? No dream. it was walt. only... Taller. Taller? what, like a giant? Okay, what exactly did walt tell you? He said I had work to do, That I had to stop this woman, naomi, From bringing the rest of her people here. what, you didn't ask any follow-up questions? Ben had shot me and left me for dead. walt saved my life, So I pretty much took him at his word. He shot you, yet here you are, Fit as a fiddle, trompin' through the jungle. The bullet went in one side, came out the other. I'd probably be dead if I still had a kidney there. Anything else? It's down there. Miles! Hey, miles! Miles! Miles! Is he dead? Back up, handsome. Miles! Whoa, whoa, whoa!Whoa, whoa! Miles! Take it easy. it's okay. they're here to help us. It's okay, miles. they're just trying to help. Hey! back away from him! hands where I can see 'em!

Oh. oh, please come in. Which room is it? It's upstairs at the end of the hall. I get paid in advance. $200, cash only. You told me $100 on the phone. that was before my buddy at the police station Told me your grandson was murdered. It's gonna be $200. Fine. No matter what you hear, Don't come up. You're not doing your grandmother any good Staying here, man. You're causing her a lot of pain. I... I wanna go downstairs and tell her you've gone. But the only way I'm gonna be able to do that Is if you tell me where it is. So where is it? You can go now. Did it work? Yeah. He's at peace now. Here. You get a refund, half off. Wasn't as tricky as I thought. Thank you. Thank you. Miles  Miles! Miles. Miles! Hey, hey! What are you doing? what are you doing? These are good people. they why'd naomi use the damn code? Yeah, you remember when she said, "tell my sister I love her"? well, she doesn't have a sister. That's what we're supposed to say If we get captured and have a gun to our heads. Like right now jack here would say, "tell my sister I love her." you get it?! We didn't kill your friend. then take me to her body. Miles, what about charlotte? what about frank? take me to naomi! Listen, naomi was killed, but not by us. It was--it was a man by the name of john locke. He's not with us anymore. kate, seriously, if I have to ask you again-- Look, even if I took you to her body, You wouldn't know what happened. I'll know! Now take me to her body. Alex alex. Alex alex. What? something I need to tell you. Keep your mouth shut, mr. linus. Karl. now if you're gonna sleep with my daughter, I insist you call me ben. Easy kid. guy's just trying to get in your head. Go take a walk or somethin'. Mind if I ask you a question, james? Yeah, I do. Why'd you leave kate behind? You're wasting your time, yoda. I know it's not pleasant, but let's face it. You really don't stand a chance now. Chance at what? James, look at yourself. Yes, on this island, You're brave, daring, handsome. You're someone. But if you left with them... Back in the real world, a lowlife scam artist like you Could never compete with a first-class surgeon. I think kate was really upset When you made your choice to come with us. Thank god she has jack there to comfort her-- James! James! Don't. don't what?! Anyone want to tell me why we're keeping this guy alive?! we're keeping him alive Because he's been on this island a lot longer than any of us, Because he has information we need, And because apart from his mouth, He's completely harmless. His mouth put that hole in your gut? Okay, james, Let's--let's execute him right here, right now, In front of his daughter. It's only a matter of time before he gets us, johnny. And I'll bet he's already figured out How he's gonna do it. So you walk him. What is he doing? The light... Is strange out here, isn't it? It's... it's kind of like it doesn't-- It doesn't scatter quite right. Dan? Dan? Your name's dan, right? Listen, dan, I know that you don't want anybody to get hurt, right? So why don't you just put that away? Uh... Because, um, miles... would kill me? But we're just trying to help-- Kate, you're wasting your breath. Let's just let this play out and see what happens, okay? They didn't kill her. It happened like they said it did. It's charlotte. She's only 3 kilometers from here. all right, then. let's go get her. I said let's go. You need to put the guns down. what?! Put the guns down. now why would I do that? Because our friends are out in the jungle right now Holding a gun at your head and his head. So I'm gonna forget about the misunderstanding. Just put the guns down. come on. how stupid do you think i-- I don't know, miles. How stupid are you? How many different languages do you have to read that in Before you believe it's true? How many different languages are there? Excusez-moi. He wants to know if we're lost. remind him that people in our line of work Are terrible at keeping secrets. I know about the dig. He says the site is closed. Then tell him to open it. Dinosaur? Not by a few million years. It's an ursus maritimus. Wait, "ursus" as in bear? As in polar bear. Charlotte, we're in the desert. this is a hoax, right? He wants to know what you're doing with the hammer. excavating. Is that a collar? Hi yourself. We were worried when you didn't get back, So we went out to the cockpit and tracked you from there. Thanks for that, for what it's worth. don't mention it. Somebody could've told me that the calvary were here. I gave you that... Wink. What are your names? Uh, I'm daniel faraday, and this is miles-- Don't tell him my last name. I guess this is just miles. What do you do for a living, daniel? I'm a physicist. I mean, I guess you could call me a physicist. I don't really like being pigeonholed into one-- dan, I swear to god, You say one more word, I'm gonna break your fingers. And what do you do, miles? I collect soil samples. Well, that's nice. well, maybe you can help me. You say you're not here on a rescue mission, And the world at large believes us to be dead. But here we are, alive and well, And you don't seem remotely surprised to see us. Oh, my god. you guys were on oceanic flight 815. wow! Is that better? I can't believe you're alive. How many of you are there? Why do you wanna know? Why wouldn't I want to know? 48 of us survived the crash. That's not counting the tail section. They're pretty much all dead now-- hugo. So you've all been living here this entire time? Is that your baby? Yeah. this is aaron. Did you have him here on the island? mm-hmm. That's amazing. Well, I've got about a million more questions I want to ask you, But they can wait until we get you back to the freighter. We've all got one of these transponders, So if we just sit tight, they're gonna be here soon, okay? This team of yours-- how many of you are there? Four, including me. And what happened to your helicopter? I don't know. the pilot was trying to put it down. Where? I don't know. I had to jump. It was chaos. I'm lucky to be alive. Get up. you're coming with us. What? what? We need to stay where we are so that they can find us. See, there's your problem. we don't want to be found. I wouldn't mess around with that if I were you. It can't hurt to try and call someone else. oh, it can hurt. What'd you do? I didn't do anything. Your friend--charlotte. She's moving. And she's moving fast. She's running from something. According to this, she's right here. Charlotte?! Charlotte?! Charlotte! Charlotte! Over there. over there. Vincent Vincent. Locke's got her. We want to caution our viewers that the images They are about to see are graphic in nature. Viewer discretion is advised. Authorities have released dramatic footage Of the sunken remains Of oceanic flight 815. The national transportation safety board Has set up a hotline For family members of the oceanic victims. The n.t.s.b. has begun The victim identification process. We have confirmation That this is the pilot-- captain seth norris. In a statement, the n.t.s.b. said that, "due to the sheer depth of the..." "...recovery of the bodies would be next to impossible. "we can only hope "that identification will provide closure To the families of the victims." National transportation safety board, oceanic hotline. Yeah, let me speak to your supervisor. Yes, sir. are you a family member of the deceased? No, I'm not, but I got some information on the crash. May I please speak to your supervisor? Sir, if you could just tell me-- look, i'm staring at the television right now. You're broadcasting footage of the wreckage And saying that that's the pilot, seth norris. Yes, sir? Well, that's not him. Please hold. Who am I speaking with? Doesn't matter who I am. you're showing footage Of seth norris, and that's not him. Listen, this guy married his high school sweetheart at 19. He always wore his wedding ring. and I'm telling you, There's no ring on that body. sir, it's likely the ring fell off when-- I'm telling ya, that is not him. And how exactly is it That you know all about captain norris? Because I was supposed to be flying oceanic 815 on that day. That's them. That's somebody from my team. What's wrong with you people? we're here because of you. I just almost died jumping out of a helicopter Because you called us for help. Maybe we should go see who launched that flair. Yeah, I mean, they could be hurt, john. she's lying. And whatever they came for, it isn't us. We keep moving forward as planned. sure. Who are we to argue with taller ghost walt? you know what? You people do whatever you want. I want you to come with us. I'm not asking for permission. and if you think You're gonna bloody stop me from getting to my-- What did you do, you son of a bitch?! uhh! Vest. What? Vest. vest. Is he alive? He's got a pulse. Frank? Frank Frank? Frank. Hey, hey. frank. Are you okay? What happened? We got struck by lightning. Frank, where's charlotte? She bailed out just b-before we went down. I don't know where she is. where's the chopper? I saw a cow. Lapidus, where's the chopper? where did it crash? Crash? the hell kind of pilot you think I am? I put her down safe and sound right over there. So this is the team? You've familiarized yourself with their profiles? unfortunately, yes. With respect, These are the wrong people for a mission like this. None of them have field experience, Military training. You can't just drop them in unprotected. It'll be a disaster. they're not unprotected. they have you. There's only so much I can do. Your modesty This is a high-risk covert op in unstable territory. It's dodgy enough without having to babysit A head case, ghostbuster, anthropologist and a drunk. To be fair, he's also a pretty good pilot. It's madness. what if we find survivors from 815? There were no survivors. Yes, I know. but what if there are survivors? There were nosurvivors of oceanic 815. Don't ask questions. just do what you were hired for. Every member of this team Was selected for a specific purpose. Everything relies on you Getting them in, getting them out And preventing anyone from getting killed. Think you can do that? Sure. Why not? There's some minor damage, But the mechanical systems are intact. So it'll fly, then? Absolutely. Can I have the phone now? Tell you what. I'll give you the phone If you tell me what you people are doing here. I'll tell you what we're doing here If you give me the phone. Don't say anything about your sister. Hello? Regina, it's miles. I need to talk to minkowski. Minkowski can't come to the phone right now. It's important. go get him. Miles, he can't come to the phone right now. All right, have him call me when he can. I gotta go. Whoa, whoa, whoa! what are you doing with her? We're taking her with us. What's the point? that's--that's not naomi. it's just meat. Miles, we can't just leave her here. Miles is right. we burned up most of the damn fuel Flying around in that storm. We barely got enough to get back to the freighter. We're not gonna carry any unnecessary weight. I'll take her on the next run. I promise, dan. There's a blanket over there by my backpack. Would you grab it? yeah. Look as bad as it feels? How bad does it feel? What's your name again? Juliet Juliet. Juliet. Juliet Juliet. Juliet what? Juliet burke Juliet burke. Juliet burke... Juliet burke... You weren't on that plane, were ya? Miles£¡ Miles! Yeah? This is juliet, And she was not on the plane. What?! you sure? You know how many times I studied that damn manifest? Believe me, there's no "juliet burke" on that plane. She's a native. Really? Where is he?! back off! Where's who? you wanted to know why we're here? I'll tell you why we're here. We're here for benjamin linus. Now where is he? James, listen to me. Please-- keep your mouth shut. You okay? I feel like I've got a cinder block on my chest, But I'll survive. I'm sorry you got shot. I didn't intend for that to happen. really? Cause it seemed like you were about to shoot me yourself. What good would you be to me dead? Well, I feel much more comfortable now. thanks. I guess this is the part Where I'm supposed to say, "i told ya so." James, I stand corrected. You want me to do it? No, it's my mess. I'll clean it up. No, wait! Danielle, you should escort alex away from here. Alex, come on, let's go. come on. alex. no! no! She's right. let's go. anyone who doesn't want to see this should leave now. Please. john, we should talk about this! Claire, what if one of those bullets had hit you or the baby? john, listen. I have information that you need. I have answers. What is the monster? What? The black smoke, the monster. What is it? I don't know. Good-bye, benjamin. Her name is charlotte lewis. Charlotte staples lewis Charlotte staples lewis. Born july 2nd, 1979, essex, england.
