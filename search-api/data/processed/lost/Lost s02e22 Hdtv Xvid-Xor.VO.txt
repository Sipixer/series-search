They were muddy. Did you find him? No. I hear you're a priest. Yes. Guess you believe in hell,then. For a brief time I served in a small parish in england. Every sunday after mass, I would see young boy waiting at the back of the church, and then one day the boy confessed to me that he had beaten his dog to death with a shovel. He said the dog had bitten his baby sister on the cheek, and he needed to protect her. And he wanted to know whether he would go to hell for this. I told him that god would understand, that he would be forgiven... as long as he was sorry. But the boy did not care about forgiveness He was only afraid that if he did go to hell... that dog would be there waiting for him. hey. You all right? Yeah. I was coming backto check on you.

When the plane crashed,I was on my way to los angeles to bury my dad. I'm sorryto hear that. It seems like sucha long time ago now. I was gonna goright from the airport to the cemetery,but... I had no ideawhat I was gonna say. Here we are again. I think michaelhas been compromised. Let's keep walking,jack. What do you mean,compromised- his actions are not those of a man who is telling the truth. Why would he lie to us? Because I believe a fatherwould do anything for his son, because I believe that michaelmay have freed henry, and because I believehe's leading you into a trap. You believe a lot,sayid. And I also believethat henry was one of them. All right. Let's go talk to him. No,he must continueto believe he's in control. Why the hellwould we want to do that? So we can createan advantage. How? I don't know yet. But we have one more nightto figure that out. Ana lucia cortez was... before we crashed,she was a police officer. I don't think it was easyfor her being here, but I think she didthe best she could. She was a woman of few words, and I'm gonna followher example. Rest in peace,ana. libby was... she was... libby was a psychologist. Or... psychiatrist. One of those. By the way,she probably helpeda lot of people. she helped me She was my friend. It's not fair that thishappened to her. It's not. I'm going with you.
