My condition is not an issue. l've lived with it for four years. l'll get you on a plane back to Sydney. l don't want to go to Sydney! You don't know who you're dealing with. Don't tell me what l can't do! This is destiny. This is my destiny! l'm supposed to do this, damn it! How do you open a hatch that has no handle, no latch, no discernible way of opening it? What's that? A game. My favorite game. l used to play with my brother. lt's called Mouse Trap. How do you play? You start with all these parts off the board. And then, one by one, you build the trap. Shoe. Bucket. Tub. Piece by piece, it all comes together. And then you wait till your opponent lands here on the old Cheese Wheel. Then if you set it up just right, you spring the trap. Go ahead, kiddo. May l help you, ma'am? Yes... Could you tell me where the footballs are? Yeah. Aisle eight for regulation. Aisle fifteen for Nerf. Oh, yes, thank you. Thanks. You want my opinion? Boone, you gotta have some faith. All we gotta do is break the glass, and then we're in. Trebuchet delivers half a ton of force. Why is it a trebuchet? Looks like a catapult. lt's called a trebuchet, because it's a trebuchet. l don't get you, man. One minute you're quoting Nietzsche, now you're an engineer. l don't think l can spell ''trebuchet.'' There's a T on the end. l'm serious. We've been coming here every day. You never talk about yourself. Everybody's got a story. My story would bore you. Three. Two. One. This was supposed to work. - This was supposed to work! - John! Your leg, man. You OK? Yeah. l'm fine. [sizzles] Your trebuchet. Why didn't it work? lt didn't work because it wasn't strong enough. That won't break, whatever it's made of. Everything breaks if you apply the right force. We'll build another invention and hope it works? That's right. - What if it doesn't? - The island will tell us what to do. What's that? We should get back there. Salvage those pieces. Your leg OK? lt's fine. [man] Night, John. [man] You all right, guy? Hey! Hey! - You following me? - l'm sorry. Who are you? l'm your mother. Look, Ms... l don't know why you think l'm your son - or how you found me, but... - You're adopted, aren't you? No, l was raised in a foster home. Well, several foster homes, actually. Look, l don't mean to be rude. What do you want from me? l want to tell you that you're special. Very special. You are part of a design. You do realize that, don't you? That our meeting, me finding you, this is a sign of things to come. Great things. My father... ...is he still alive? Still alive? Oh, John, don't you understand? You don't have a father. You were immaculately conceived. - Which one? - That one. You're sure? This is the one l've been using, and nothing's happening. - l'm sorry it's not helping. - What's not helping? Nothing. Thanks anyway. Nice garden. What was that all about? He has headaches. Doesn't the guy have aspirin stashed away somewhere? He says aspirin didn't help. Can l ask you a question? Say you're having bad headaches. - Every day. - You OK? Yeah. l'm fine. So, who are we talking about then, Kate? - Sawyer. - Uh-huh. There might be something wrong with him. - What does he think? - Says he's fine... - Then he's fine. - He could be playing it down. - There could be something... - Look... l'd love to check the guy out and make sure he's OK, but we both know all l'm gonna get for my trouble is a snappy one-liner, and if l'm real lucky, a brand-new nickname. l'm just over it. You're late. - Late for what? - Late for work. - l think l'm done working. - l'm sorry. What? This is useless. You can't open that thing up. - Don't tell me what l can't do. - You get it? lt's a dead end. You're not getting in. We didn't find this by accident. - We're supposed... - We're supposed to find this, right? We're supposed to open it. Then tell me something. lf we're supposed to open it, why haven't we opened it yet? - The island will send us a sign. - ''The island will...'' All that's happening now is our faith is being tested. We will open it. The island will show us how. What kind of sign will the island send us? [engine droning] Did you see that? - [crash] - Boone? [pottery breaking] Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs. Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs. No, no. - Please don't. - Theresa falls up the stairs. Don't take it back. [gasps] Boone. Wake up. - What time is it? - lt's morning. Come on. OK. l'm up. What's going on? Come on. Let's go. [man] Emily Annabeth Locke, in ten thousand words or less. So, she's my mother. l lifted some hairs from her car and matched them with your DNA. lt's 99 percent certain. She was institutionalized. A few times. - What for? - Nothing criminal or violent. lt's a type of schizophrenia. lf she stays on her meds, she's OK. What about my father? Here's the thing. Your mother sought you out, so she's fair game. But this guy, maybe he doesn't even know you exist. Now, l've done this enough times to know... ...this stuff isn't meant to be, even though it may feel that way. Look, this probably won't have a happy ending. So... ...do you want it or not? l want it. - Your name is? - John Locke. - l'm Anthony Cooper's son. - Mr. Cooper doesn't have a son. Tell him l don't want anything. My mother is Emily Locke. Please. Just a minute. Mr. Cooper, l got John Locke here, says he's your son. Yes, sir. Well, you can go on in, sir. [man] Well... [chuckles] This is awkward. Thank you for seeing me, sir. l'm... John. Something tells me l'm gonna want a drink for this? - You want a drink? - Yeah. All right. Great. - Scotch OK? - Yeah, that's... Thanks. So who found who? - l'm sorry, sir? - Emily. Your mother. Did she find you, or did you find her? She found me. How did she look? - All right, l guess. - She say anything about me? She said l didn't have a father. That l was immaculately conceived. Really? [chuckles] Well, l guess that makes me God, huh? l didn't know you existed until a year after you were born. She told me she wasn't gonna have the baby, you, at all. She drops off the face of the planet. She turns up asking for money, telling me she put you up for adoption. You gonna drink that or what? You have a family of your own? - No, sir. - Me neither. l tried it a couple times. Didn't take. - Do you hunt? - No. You're not an animal rights nut-job? No, sir. What are you doing this Sunday? - Nothing. - You wanna go hunting? Uh... Well, l'd like that. Yeah, l'd like that very much. l had a dream last night. l asked for a sign. And then l saw a plane crash. A Beechcraft. Right out there. lt was a dream, but... ...it was the most real thing l've ever experienced. - l know where to go now. - Go for what? To find what we need to open this bastard up. You using that paste that made me see my sister get eaten? No, Boone, no. 'Cause, l gotta tell you, signs and dreams and... Who's Theresa? - What? - ''Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs.'' You were saying that in the dream. - How would you know about that? - l don't know, but we're supposed to go to this place. We're supposed to find that plane. Will you come with me? l was gonna ask you how this was going, but it's coming together fast. [Michael] Fire wasn't a total loss. We learned things from building the first one, which is saving us from trial and error. Now it's just... ...trial. [speaking Korean] Yeah, yeah. Yeah, man, l know. ''Now, now.'' Picking up a little Korean? Yeah. l'm pretty sure l know how to say ''faster'' and ''idiot''. l hear you're having trouble with your head. Now she got you making house calls? You're sensitive to the light too? - l'm sensitive to you... - All right. We'll see you. Doc! Sensitivity to the light, that bad? - Depends. - On what? On what's causing your headaches. lt's not like it's a tumor or something. - What makes you think it's a tumor? - l don't. Great. OK then. My uncle.... ...he, uh... -...died of a brain tumor. - Yeah? That run in the family? Tumors? What type of tumor was it? The type that kills you. Do you smell anything funny? Brain tumors bring on phantom smells. Like something burning. Just headaches. Well, l'm sure you're fine, then. lf this is worrying you, there's tests l could do. Sorry, doc. Sounds fun, but... ...my insurance ran out. lnsurance ran out. That's a good one. [sniffing] l could've mentioned her name out by the hatch one day. - [Locke] Who? - Theresa. Maybe l was talking to myself. Maybe. But you didn't. So, in this dream you saw a plane crash, right? - Yeah. - OK. The fact that we were just in a plane crash, you didn't think for one second... - John, you OK? - l'm fine. - What is wrong with your leg? - l'm fine. What? Someone from camp hiked all the way out here? - Nope. - Where do you think it came from? Him. - Morning, Eddie. - Morning, Mr. Locke. - You gonna get birds again? - l hope so. Anthony? You weren't supposed to be here till 1 2<i>:</i>00. l thought you said 1 1 <i>:</i>00. - What is this? - lt's a dialysis machine. My kidney's failing. Damn doctors say l need a transplant. - When? - Tomorrow, if it were up to me. l'm on the donor list. But l'm an old man, and it's a long list. - How long... - The dialysis will be fine for awhile. l didn't tell you for this exact reason. l'm not gonna let this spoil a fantastic day, and neither should you. l'll get done here, and we'll have a nice lunch and go shoot some birds. [Boone] He was a priest. How long you think he's been dead? Clothing would decompose within two years, but this is high-quality polyester. Could be two years, could be ten. Gold teeth. Obviously well-off. - What kind of money is that? - Nigerian naira. What is a Nigerian priest doing on an island in the South Pacific? l'm not so sure he was a priest. [banging] You wanna keep it down? - That's it. Get up. - What? Get up. - You're going to Jack. - Do l get a lollipop? - When did the headaches start? - A few days ago. A week maybe. Do you have to be here? Do you have them when you wake up? Usually they hit me middle of the day. What are you doing with that? Checking how your pupils respond to changing stimuli. What's that? That nod. - Let him do his thing. - l am, but l wanna know - what he thinks l should... - Shut up and relax. - What are you doing? - You ever had a blood transfusion? What? No. - Taken pills for malaria? - Nope. Have you ever had sex with a prostitute? - What's that got to do with anything? - ls that a yes? Yes. And have you ever contracted a sexually transmitted disease? l'm gonna take that as another yes. When was the last outbreak? Go to hell, doc. - l know he deserved it, but... - He needs glasses. What's going on? Nothing. - You can barely walk, man. - lt's the wound from the shrapnel. That's your right leg. What's with your left? l'm fine. Now stop asking. - That's it. Let's go back. - l'm fine. No, you're not. Let me get you to Jack. No. Jack wouldn't know the first thing about what's wrong with me. John. - We've gotta go back. - No. What is wrong with you? Are you crazy? - l was in a wheelchair. - What? Paralyzed. For four years. The plane, our plane, l was in that chair when we took off, but not after we crashed. Why were you in a wheelchair? That doesn't matter anymore. But this island, it changed me. lt made me whole. Now it's trying to take it back, and l don't know why. But it wants me to follow what l saw. - What? - l know it sounds crazy. Four weeks ago, l wouldn't have believed it. We are here for a reason. There's something that we were meant to find. lt's gonna help us get into the hatch. l know it. But we gotta keep going. OK. Can you move your legs? Just help me up, son. OK. - [Locke groans] - [Boone] OK. These doves fly a lot faster than you think. So you gotta really lead them. lf you have to drop it in high cover... - Got him. - Yeah, you did. Good shot, son. John, your mother, she may be a little crazy, but at least she brought us together. And thank God it happened now, while we still have time. Let's find your bird. She was my nanny. Theresa, she was my nanny. My mother wasn't around much. l needed someone to take it out on. My bedroom was at the top of a flight of stairs. And l would sit in bed all day, calling her on the intercom. One day she took a bad step. Broke her neck. l was six. [laughs] What the hell is so funny? - ls that the plane you saw? - As best l can tell. - You really saw it? - Yeah. l really saw it. How long do you think it's been there? Doesn't matter. What's important is that we found it. What's important is what's inside it. What is inside of it? You're gonna have to climb up there for us and find out. You can still change your mind. Nah. They already shaved my back. l'm so thankful for you. This was meant to be. See you on the other side, son. lf you're looking for a stool sample, you can forget it. You've been reading a lot... ...since we came to the island. OK. So what? You... You've got... - You've got hyperopia. - Hyperopia? That's... - What is that? - You're farsighted. - Farsighted? - Yeah. lt can develop later in life when you add a new strain to the eyes. Like with reading. Blurry. Better or worse? Worse. Uh-uh. No way. lt's not a fashion show. Har har, very funny. [Hurley] Dude. Looks like someone steamrolled Harry Potter. You love this, don't you? You're welcome. [grunting, panting] Hang on. - [screaming] - Boone! Boone! l'm fine. Boone, what do you see? Boone! You wanna know what's in your damn plane? Here's your sign. They're drug smugglers. Heroin. That's all that's in here. l don't understand. l don't understand. [static] [creaking] Boone! Boone, get out! Hello. Hello. Anybody out there? - Mayday! Mayday! - There's no time. Get out now! - <i>Is someone there?</i> - Hello! Hello! - Can you hear me? - <i>Repeat your transmission, please.</i> Hello! We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 81 5. - Please copy. - [Locke] Get out now! Hello. We're survivors of flight 8 1 5. Ah! Ahh! [panting] Ah! Ahh! [shouts] [Locke grunts, groans] [Locke shouts] So did you know before or after you asked him about his latest outbreak? l'd answer that, but, you know, doctor-patient confidentiality. Of course. Thank you for helping him. l know it was probably the last thing you wanted to do. l didn't do it for him. Jack! Help! No, no, no. Put him down up here. All right. That's it. OK. Easy. Easy. - What happened? - There was an accident. Boone fell off a cliff out near the place where we were hunting. OK, l'm gonna need some water. Shirts, towels. Anything that l can use to staunch the bleeding. Kate, now! Please. John, tell me exactly what happened. John? Locke! Locke! Locke! l think what you did was so kind. - Where's my father? - Who? We had the transplant together. l didn't know he was your father. We don't have the same last name. - Where is he? - Mr. Cooper checked out this afternoon. He went back home. He's under private care. That doesn't make any... Wha... [gasps] - Did he leave me a message? - No, not that l know of. You just relax, Mr. Locke. l'm gonna get you some juice. [Emily] lt was his idea. l'm sorry, John. What are you doing here? l needed some money. He's always been good that way. Your father's always been generous. You told me l didn't have a father. He said that was the only way you would give it to him. lt had to be your idea. He told me where to find you. He asked me to go see you. l wanted to see you. This can't be happening. This is a misunderstanding. This can't happen to me. He wouldn't do this to me. He wouldn't do this to me! Eddie! - Eddie, open the gate! - Mr. Cooper's not seeing guests. - l'm not a guest. - l'm sorry, John. Eddie, open the gate. l'm sorry. l'm gonna need you to move your car. l know you're watching me. You can't do this. John, please. Move your car. [yelling] [yelling] [sobbing] l've done everything
