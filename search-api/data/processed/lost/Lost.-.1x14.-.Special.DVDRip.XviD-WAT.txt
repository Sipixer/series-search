- Thanks, Charlie. - You're quite welcome. - Listen to me. - [Kate] Sayid. - We're not alone. - [Jack] Has anyone seen Ethan? [Michael] He took off to the beach. - [Jack] Where's Charlie? - [Locke] He went after Claire. [Locke] Footprints, three sets, all over the place. l think they've been taken. Claire. All they wanted was Claire. Walt! Walt! Walt! Walt! Have you seen Claire's bags? - You seen my son? - You seen her bags? - Claire's? - Her luggage. No one seems to know what's happened to it. Sorry, l don't know. l'm just looking for Walt. Oh. Got it. Sorry. l've not seen him. Hey, Jack. You seen my boy when you were out there? No. He was at the caves. Yeah, he took his dog for a walk. Told him to stay close as usual. You listened to your old man when you were ten? Uh, yeah, l listened. Maybe a little too well. Yo, dudes, got a new tourney lined up. We're playing for deodorant sticks. You dawgs up for some golf? l gotta go find my kid. Hey, if Walt shows up, tell him to stay right here until l get back. You got it. - Walt! - He seems to hate it, doesn't he? - What? - Being a dad. No, it's just... a lot of hard work. Walt? Walt! [Hurley] Nah, he hates it. Walt? Walt? Walt! [Michael] This is the one. This is definitely my baby's crib. Uh-huh. Beautiful. lt'll look great in the alley we'll be living in. - This is three months' rent. - What? lt's not three... Look, don't you want the best for this kid? l know you're excited, but we can't afford this. Our baby in this crib. Come on. That's a happy kid. l talked to Andy. He said he can throw some work my way. - Construction? What about your art? - No. l'm not giving it up. l'll take a break until you finish law school. Pass the bar, get hired by some fancy-ass, high-paying law firm. - Somebody's got it all figured. - [laughing] l'll get back to painting eventually. Meanwhile, you can support me and Walt in the manner to which we'll soon become accustomed. ''Walt,'' huh? l'd like to do that, you know? Name him after my dad. Walter. Walter Lloyd. ''Lloyd''? Oh, all right. That's why you won't marry me. lt's not that marriage is too prosaic. You want him to have your last name. Hey, you want me to agree to ''Walter,'' or what? - Man, l suck. - You can do better than that. - You might wanna take it easy on him. - See this knot, Walt? l want you to aim for it. Right here. Focus on it. All right? Picture it in your mind's eye. You know what that is, right? - A picture in your head. - Right. Do it again, but see it. See it before you do it. Visualize the path. See it. See it. - Whoa. - Yes! l knew you had it in you. lt was weird. l actually saw it in my mind like it was real. - Who's to say it wasn't? - Hey! What the hell is going on? - Gimme that. - But l... - Take Vincent and go back to camp. - Mr. Locke... Now, little man. - You gave my boy a knife? - You should've seen... Don't tell me what l should've seen. Back home, l'd call the police on you! Encouraging a kid to sneak away. - Giving him a knife? - Walt knows his own mind. - Don't talk to me like you know him! - You need to calm down. You keep playing my son against me, and l'm gonna have a... The man said ''calm down.'' [grunting] - What are you, his attack dog? - Easy. You were waving the knife. He was trying to make sure you didn't hurt someone. Michael, l know it's been difficult to bond with your son. You know why he's attached to me? Because l treat him like an adult. He's ten years old. He's been through more than most people. You haven't spent enough time with him to see it, but he's different. - What did you say? - And we're not back home. As long as we're here, Walt should be allowed to realize his potential. You stay away from my son. And me. [music box plays lullaby] [Michael] You're not taking him. You're not taking my son. You can go if you want to, but Walt stays with me. - l'm trying to have a discussion. - You're not. You're talking about going to Amsterdam. You and him. How is that a discussion? lt's an offer, and that's where the job is. You said you were happy. What about the legal clinic being a good fit? You said that. This is a huge opportunity. l've wanted to do lnternational Law. Am l supposed to be happy for you? For your huge opportunity? [Walt cooing] We've talked about taking some time apart. Look, babe, l thought that was... Hey, we said a lot of things. You said you wanted to live on a boat. l still love you. You know l do, but we've been through so much in such a short time. - Things... - Babe, we got problems. That's what people have. You wanna go to counseling? l'm down with that. Let's go. Right? Oh, man. You already took it, didn't you? The job. Yeah, l did. You haven't worked in months. Construction slows in the winter. l told you. l can provide for him, give him everything. Except for his dad. He's not going with you! No! - You wanna argue about this? - Yes. There are laws against this. We're not married, Michael. l'm his mother, and l'm employed. Who is the court gonna side with? This is not goodbye forever. l just... l need some time. Are you all right? l'm okay. Thanks. l just don't know how to talk to him. How to get him to, you know, understand l'm on his side. Locke says l should stop treating him like a child. l missed his whole childhood, so... lt just can't happen. [Sun] What? He can't grow up here. He can't grow up in this place. Once l realized these equations were coordinates, latitude and longitude, l assumed she was trying to determine the location of the island. But it was incomplete, her notations fragmented. - Except for the fish song. - Mm-hmm. - The what? - When l lay the pages down like this, l realized it wasn't showing the location of the island. l think it's a location on the island. Specifically, here. So where are we? ln relation to the triangle? Well, the map is hardly at scale, so l don't know. We're not even sure it's a map of this island, are we? We're not. This may be the transmitter sending out her distress call, - and its power source. - What are we talking about? Another excuse to get chased down and killed by whatever lives in the jungle? Guys, we can't keep doing this. Building water filtration systems, playing golf, making a sweet home here. - We need to get off this island! - You think any of us wanna be here? No. But l don't think anyone wants to get off as much as l do. So, are you suggesting something? - Yeah. We build a raft. - A raft? Look, don't say it like that. We need a little optimism here. Okay? We gotta do something, 'cause, let's be honest, no one's coming. Those seats we took off the fuselage, they float. And we got an axe. And a whole bunch of trees, bamboo. - We can do this. - The chances of surviving rough waters, - the odds of finding a shipping lane... - And l get seasick. You know what? Great. Stay here. Grow old, good luck. But l'm doing this. My son and l are leaving. Anybody that wants to help us build, God bless you. [reading in Spanish] [Michael] Hey, Walt. Hey, come on. l need your help with something. - l'm doing stuff. - You're reading comics in Spanish, - and you don't read Spanish, man. - l like the pictures. You like the art, huh? l guess so. You know, when l was your age, maybe a little older, l traced comics. Taught myself about perspective. You know what that is? Perspective? - Hey. - l said l need your help. Let's go. - Why do l have to come? - l seen what happens when l don't keep an eye on you. - Let me talk to him. - <i>[woman] He's 2 1 months old.</i> - <i>He doesn't use the phone.</i> - l'll talk. l just want him to hear my voice. l miss him. I know. Let me call you back. This isn't a good time. - <i>[man] We gotta go?</i> - <i>It's Michael.</i> - <i>Honey.</i> - <i>I'm getting off.</i> - Who's that? - <i>Let's talk tomorrow.</i> What the hell is going on? Michael, listen. I've been seeing someone. What? Who? - <i>Does it make any difference?</i> - Who is it? Brian Porter. - The guy who hired you? - <i>It wasn't like that before.</i> When you said you needed time to think, you were lying. - <i>No, I did, and I realized...</i> - l'm coming to Amsterdam. - <i>Don't. It's over between us.</i> - l'm not coming for you. l'm coming for Walt. l'm getting my son back. [honking] [woman screams] [man] Call an ambulance! Help me. - [siren wailing] - [people chattering] Charlie? Hey. These are Claire's. Who brought them here? - l did. Why? What are you doing? - l don't know where it is. - What? - Claire's diary. She kept her diary in this pocket. l know because l saw her put it there. Someone's taken it. [Walt] What are we looking for again? Any piece of metal or plastic tubing. Anything that looks like it'd work as a frame. - A frame for what? - You'll see soon enough. Separate cushions, plastic, tarp. Put everything you find in different piles so we can take stock. Am l being punished? You think working with your old man is punishment? No, man. This is us taking control of our destiny. Feels like punishment. Sawyer. Hey, Sawyer. - You know, l could just go inside. - [Sawyer] Trick or treat. - So, what are you two selling today? - Where's Claire's diary? - Someone took it from her bag. - Oh, l get it. Something goes missing, and you figure it's gotta be me that took it. Do you have the diary or not? - You mean this one? - Give it to me. l'm not sure that's the best idea. Maybe Missy Claire don't want you reading it. - l wasn't gonna read it. - Curious what she wrote about you? You bastard. Did you read it? Good literature's scarce around here. - He read it! - Just give it to us. ''Dear Diary, l'm getting really freaked out by that has-been pop star. - l think he's stalking me.'' - Sawyer! ''Diary, the little limey runt just won't let up.'' Ow! - You hit like a ponce. - Oh, yeah? All right, enough. You didn't really read it, did you? l just hadn't gotten around to it yet. [chattering] Um, l'm gonna get some water. Yeah, okay. Would you bring me some? Please? Please and thank you. We gotta work on that. Boone. Hi. So you guys just gonna keep coming back without any food? - Hey, l'm serious. - Uh-huh. What's going on with you? Could you be acting any weirder? You've been a functioning bulimic since junior high. l thought you'd be excited about dropping a size or two. Since you're not having any luck with the hunting, maybe you should help Michael. He's building a raft. l was thinking l would help him out. Finally get out of here. Why don't you help me? No, thanks. Your father doesn't want us spending time together. He's not the boss of me. But he's your father. He cares about you, and you need to show him respect. l'm serious, Walt. You're not to come to me anymore. Damn it! What is wrong with you? - l was just coming to see... - l told you to stay away from my son! - l was... - l don't want to hear you! l was giving him this pencil to give to you. l thought you could use it. Consider it a peace offering. l catch you with my son again, l'll kill you. - You're a jerk. - What did you say to me? - He didn't do anything. He's my friend! - He's not anymore. - l'm looking out for you. - You never cared about me. - What? - You showed up after Mom died. Where were you when l was growing up? Nowhere! Listen, Walt. lt's complicated. l don't care! You're not my father! You wanna hate me? You gonna punish me for something l can't change? Fine. But you will listen to me. Now, you get over there, and you stay there. Now! - That's really wonderful. - Oh, thanks. For my son. He's gonna be two next week. Yeah? l didn't know you have a kid. Yeah. Yeah. He lives in Amsterdam with his mom. Ever get to visit him? No, not yet. l had a little, you know, run-in with a car. l never know what to write. - How about a joke? - l don't know. What kinda joke? How about ''What's black, white and red all over?'' - Yeah, a newspaper, right? - ''A penguin with a sunburn.'' - That's really dumb. - Trust me. Mother of four talking here. He'll get a kick out of it. [woman] Hello, Michael. Susan? Finally called Andy when l hadn't heard from you in over two months. l had to hear about your accident from him. You should've called me. Yeah, well, considering how our last conversation went... l'm so sorry about that. - Hey, did you bring Walt? - No. He's at home. Home. With Brian? So, what are you doing here, anyway? l came to see you. So, l look pretty good, huh? Not that bad. They say you're expected to make a full recovery. Yeah, after a year of physical therapy. A year. - l'm covering all your medical costs. - What? l've already spoken to the hospital administrator, - and all your bills are coming to me. - What is this about? Brian and l are getting married. - How nice for... - You don't have to say anything. Just listen. We're moving to ltaly at the end of the month. Brian's taking over the Rome offices. Sounds like Brian's on a roll. And he wants to adopt Walt. [sighs] Look, l know this is hard. But just think about it. - You're kidding me, right? - Consider what's best for Walt. You can keep holding on if you want. But ask yourself why you're doing that. ls it really for him? Or is it for you? Uh, dude, your kid's gone. What? He just grabbed the dog and took off. l know where he's gone. [Michael] Locke! - Where the hell is he? - What? l'm not in the mood for your games, man. - Where's Walt? - Walt's not here. - Don't lie to me. - He's not here. Look around. - l'm not talking to you. - l told him this morning that he couldn't be around me anymore. l'm trying to respect your wishes. Well, then if he's not... Let's go find your boy. Thanks. You really didn't have to help, you know. l could've managed. l've had my share of manly encounters. l just thought you could use the company. You okay? Yeah. lt's weird. l barely knew her. Barely know her... Claire. She's been missing over a week, and... ...every day she's gone, it feels like... ...bits of me are crumbling, or something. l think it's right that you should keep her stuff safe... ...'til she gets back. Yeah. Come on, Vincent. [growls, barks] - [branches rustling] - [Vincent barking] [barking] Vincent! Cut it out! Cut it out! What's wrong? Vincent! Vincent! Vincent! [Susan] He was trying to weasel his way out. Anything not to let the case go forward. Said it wasn't his jurisdiction. - [man] You're kidding me. - l wish l was. Same argument, third time in a row. Barclay said it was an immigration issue. [man] That's classic. He thinks 'cause l'm new to Australian law that l'm some yokel. Hey. Hello? Homework. - l told you l need help. - He needs help. l'm a lawyer. l can tell when someone's stalling. Who cares about birds of Australia? We're in Australia. - You okay? - l think l'm feeling kind of fluey. Shouldn't we study birds of Egypt? You haven't been sleeping much. Maybe you need to take a personal day. l picked the bronze-cuckoo. - lt's funny, wanna see? - What about Barclay? l mean, it doesn't look funny. Just the name. Sleeping in late? That's too much of a fantasy. Look! You're not looking! You're not looking! [wings fluttering, banging against window] Oh, my God! ls it dead? Yeah. Poor guy. Vincent! Vincent! [rustling] [growling] [snarling, snorting] [knocking] Michael Dawson? Yeah. Can l help you? Yeah. l'm Brian Porter. Susan's Brian? Yeah. Can l come in? l... l need to talk to you. Susan know you're here, man? Susan died yesterday. Please? Um... She, uh... [coughs] Turns out she had a blood disorder. She was only sick for about a week. l didn't know... l hadn't talked to her in awhile... Sit down. And Walt? - How is he, uh...? - Yeah, he's fine. He's back home with his nanny. - What? - l mean he's fine... l mean, considering... You know. You left him home? After he just lost his mother? Before she died, Susan, she told me she wanted you to have custody of Walter. She what? Well, l think she just thought... l mean, since you're his father... l haven't been his father in nine years. Yeah, well, that's kinda the thing, see? Look, l loved Susan very much. And l was honest with her from the beginning, but she wouldn't hear it. - Hear what? - That l... l didn't want to be a father. l just don't know how. What are you talking about? You adopted him. l did, because she wanted that, and l wanted her, and... Look... [clears throat] Two tickets. One round-trip, the other one-way. Sydney to New York. The envelope has money in it for travel expenses. She didn't tell you she wanted me to have custody. - This is your idea. - l'm a wreck right now, okay? l'm supposed to give a damn? l just lost the woman l love. l can't be his father. Lying son of a bitch! You're the only father he knows! lt's more than that. There's something about him. What the hell are you talking about? Sometimes when he's around, things happen. He's different somehow. [Michael] Over here! - What the hell would... - [Walt] Help, please! Help! - Walt? - This way. Walt! Walt! Walt should be home from school any minute. Mr. Porter asked me to give you that. Some of Susan's effects. Oh, thanks. There's something else. - What's that? - Something l think Walt should have. Excuse me. - [nanny] Walt? - Yeah? There's somebody here to see you. [roaring] [Walt] Dad! Help! - Dad! - Walt! - Dad, help! Please! - [roaring] - Help! - Hey, Walt... [Locke] Shh! [roaring] Dad! Come on! Up here! Michael! Dad! Dad... Hey, Walt. Who are you? l'm, uh... l'm your father. Hey... Um... l want you to know... Listen, l can't explain how sorry l am... ...about your mom. You should know that we, uh... ...we loved each other very much when we had you. Where's Brian? Brian's not here. l come to bring you home with me. l'm not going anywhere with you. Look, Walt, can l...? Uh... l know this is really hard to understand. All of this. See, Brian... Brian loves you very much. And he wants you to stay with him, but it's not his choice. lt's mine. l'm your legal guardian. And, uh, it's not like he's gonna disappear from your life. He'll still call you, write to you, come to see you whenever he can. And you know, you'll still have your dog. But Vincent isn't mine. He's Brian's. Brian said you could have him. [roaring] Dad. - [Michael] Hey, Walt! - Dad! Dad! - Where are you, Dad? - [Michael] Hang on! Oh... Okay. Let's go. Let's go. - [snarling] - Walt, hang in there, okay? l'm coming, man. - Dad! - Walt! Throw him the knife. Walt. lf he comes near you, use it! Stay there, buddy! [yowling] - Come here. - Dad! - Okay. You okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. - All right. Whatever you do, you hold onto this tight. You got me? - What about you? - Don't worry about me. l'll be right behind you, okay? So hold on. Okay, Locke, now! Pull him. - [Michael] Pull him, Locke. - [roaring] [roaring] [howls] [yelping] [Michael groans] Come here. l'm sorry... No, it's okay. We're okay. - l'm just glad you're safe. - But Vincent, he ran off again. He found his way back to you once, Walt. He will again. [chuckles] Hey. l got a present for you. Since you like to look at pictures. - What's this? - Well... Every card, every letter l sent you over the last eight years. - You wrote me? - Mm-hmm. l never saw these. Did my mom have these? - Why didn't she give 'em to me? - l don't know. She didn't throw 'em away, which means, somewhere inside, she wanted you to have them. So, you drew these? Just for you. This one... ...l did for your second birthday. A penguin with a sunburn? - That's dumb. - Yeah, l know. That's what l said. [Walt laughs] Jack! Sayid. You have to hear this. - What is that? - lt's Claire's, her diary. - You're reading her diary? - Yeah, l know, l'm bloody scum. Just listen to this. ''l had that weird dream again with the black rock l can't get away from. l try to leave, but it won't let me.'' - Black rock? - They're just dreams. - No. - Sayid mentioned the black rock before. The Frenchwoman said her team was returning from the black rock. The triangle on the map. Maybe it's the triangle. Maybe it's where Claire was taken. Maybe. Charlie, we all want to find Claire. But there's no sense going out into the jungle in the middle of the night. [whistling] Don't think that whistle's working, John. You can't hear everything, Boone. The sooner you learn that, the better. [rustling] Well, l heard that. [Boone] Vincent. Vincent, is that you?
