Flight 815? You were in the back? Back up! Coming up! Everything is cool. We had a talk, and they believe we were on the plane, too. I guess we can all sue Oceanic together. How many of you survived? 23 of us. Thought you said there were 23 of you. There were. It's been four days. You know, that's not that long. They said it could take up to two weeks to find a current. I mean, Michael knew what he was doing. I doubt anything would have... What? What? Sun, what's wrong? My wedding ring. It's gone. Hey, man... It's okay. Sun? You'll be with her again. Soon. Okay? Hey, I think they're trying to figure out what to do with us. I think they're going to eat us. All right, all of you, get up. We're moving out. Moving out where? You're going to help us get food and water. What, we work for you now? You're going to do it because we have a long walk ahead of us. A long walk where? Back to where you came from. All clear. Hey, Mike, think we ought to stage a prison break here. Yeah, well, I want to figure out what the hell is going on over here before I make any decisions about anything. Okay, people, listen up. We need to gather as much food and water as we can. We travel in pairs. You move as fast as you can, don't make any noise. Maybe you could just take a minute to explain to us what the hell is going on over here that's got you all so on edge? You know what? That's a great idea. Maybe we can swap stories on the road. We're gonna go scout before we move. Cindy, go with him. Libby, see what fruit you can gather. Take him with you. His name is Michael. Yeah.  Right. Michael. - Wait. - I'll be okay, man. Don't worry. Bernard and I will gather the fish. Fish. The man knows how to fish. I'd take him with you if I were you. Fine. He comes with us, too. Sun. You okay? I lost my wedding ring. When was the last time you saw it? I'm so used to it, I don't... I don't know. Well, I lost my wedding ring once. It's crazy where you'll look when you want to find something bad enough. Went through the garbage outside the house, emptied the bags and everything. I even took apart the pipes in my bathroom, because I was convinced that it had gone down the drain in the sink. What  did your wife say? - Well, she never knew. - How was that? I went to a jeweler and I had a replica made, that's how. Yeah, now it's just rattling around in my sock drawer back home. Um, I can help you look. No, thanks. I'm sure it will turn up. Hey! Hey. You wanna help us out over here? You wanna eat? Help us. Does it look like I speak Korean? Fish. - Sorry, Michael. - Sorry about what? You know, about throwing you and your friends into the pit. - Friends. - What? Just never thought about them like that. I mean, I guess one of them's my friend. - I'm guessing not the redneck. - Yeah, not the redneck. I don't think I've ever seen someone so scared in my life. And I know about scared. That why you threw us in the pit? 'Cause you're scared? And we've got... trust issues. Huh. How about that? Where the hell are all the fruit? You know, we picked these trees pretty clean. Sometimes you can find them on the ground. Then why don't you head inland? That's where all the fruit is on our side. - We don't go that way. - Why? Because that's where they come from. For your protection when we travel. You made this? So what's your name anyway? Mistereko. Mr. Eko? Yes. So what's that, like Mr. Ed? - Michael-- he just left. - What? He just said something, then he went into the jungle. He's gone. Let's go. We're leaving now. What do you mean, we're leaving? Your buddy ran off into the jungle. Michael-- he just... left. What's he trying to say? What's he saying? Walt! Walt! Let's go. We're moving out now. Cindy, water. Libby, can you carry the radio? Wait, you have a radio? Does it work? Can you use it? Wow, what a great idea. - You gonna slow us down? - No. Michael. We're leaving before he can tell them where we are. Michael. What are we supposed to do, wait for him? He ain't coming back without his kid. Walt. He ain't coming back without Walt. You really think he's gonna find him? In case you haven't noticed, it's every man for himself, Chewie. Mike's  gotta worry about Mike. And I gotta worry about me. Wait. Please. You're going the wrong way. That's where he's going. Toward them. What are you doing? I'm going to help him find his friend. We can't wait for you. I don't expect you to. All you gotta do is retrace your steps. Like, what'd you do yesterday? I woke up, washed up, walked with Shannon. We picked some fruit... cut it up to feed Vincent, and then-- Whoa. You fed the dog? Bingo. So... Seoul. Is that in the good Korea or the bad Korea? The good one. Did you go to the olympics? Hurley, this is ridiculous. Waiting here for... the dog did not eat my ring. Dude, dogs will eat anything. When I was a kid, my dog Buster? I had this drawer where I'd throw in all my change, right? And I guess there were some smarties in there, so, like, the next day, Buster craps out a buck 35 in nickels. Did you ever own a dog? Yes. Jin gave me one. A puppy. What was his name? Bpo bpo. Bpo bpo. Does that mean something? Yes. It means "a kiss." A kiss. No. - Michael. - Wait. No. His name was Goodwin. Others? Michael? No. For your cut. So you're married? Your ring. You have a wife? Yes. You? Worse. Your wife-- what is her name? Her name? Sun. She was with you? On the plane? Bad day? It's clean. Thank you. You mind if I sit? Did you see me? Rip apart your garden? No. Sometimes I wish I had a garden to tear apart. I don't think I have ever seen you angry. Oh, I used to get angry... all the time. Frustrated, too. So you're not frustrated anymore? I'm not lost anymore. How did you do that? Same way anything lost gets found... I stopped looking. No, not that way. Over here. Around the heel. This is fresh. These tracks. Michael. Yes. Michael. They don't leave tracks. Shh! - Michael. - No. They don't have him. They came from that way. Your friend went that way. Crossed ahead of them. Very lucky. You... go back. I go. No. We go together. Hey. Hello. It's pretty. Hurley told me that you lost your wedding ring. I was just sitting here, telling myself it's silly to be so upset about it. It is just a thing. Well,  they've only been gone a few days, you know-- Don't. I'm sick of everyone saying he is all right. He's not all right. Claire found the bottle-- the one with the messages inside. The one from the raft. Where is it? I buried it. Stop. Let me see your water. You keep slowing us down, we're gonna leave you behind. Go ahead. Leave me behind. All right. See ya. Got a question for ya. Yeah? Now that your tracker's gone, how you gonna find our camp without me? Walk across the island, follow the beaches. And Eko's coming back. You married? What? Are you married? No. Too bad. You seem suited for it. Funny. What about you? No, ma'am. You gay? Funny. Let's go. What are we waiting for? Wait here. We lost his trail. I go back and find it. What are you doing? Go back. Michael! Go back, man! Walt! Walt! Walt! Michael! Go away! I'm not going back without him! Walt! I'm here! Where are you, man?! - Walt! - Shh! What, you worried they're gonna hear me? Let them take me! Come! Come take me! Shouting is not a good idea. You need to come back with us now. I'm not leaving him out here! Stay away from me. I know they took your son. But you have no idea what these people are capable of. And they will not be found if they don't want to be. They took him right out of my hands. Right out of my hands. I'm not going back without him. You find Walt... Michael. Can I see it? Kate, those are private. Kate, stop. What are you doing? We didn't, uh... I didn't say good-bye.
