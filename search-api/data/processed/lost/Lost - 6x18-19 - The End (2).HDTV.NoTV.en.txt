(Miles) Linus, come in! Come in! Miles, is that you? Yeah. What... what the hell is happening? Are you with Claire? She's here, but she doesn't want to come with us. Come with you where? Lapidus is working on the plane right now. Then we're taking off. (Static crackles) (Loud rumbling) (Grunting) Hey, how much longer till we get this thing in the air? I still have to check the electrical and the hydraulics! (Thunderclap) Five hours, maybe six. You've got maybe one!</i> Get your asses over here! We're leaving in an hour! Son of a bitch! How the hell are we supposed to get over there?! I know how we can get there! Locke has a boat! (Thunderclap) Locke! (Blade whooshes) Aah! (Both grunting) (Groans) Uhh! Uhh! Aah! (Both grunting) Uhh! (Loud rumbling) (Rumbling stops) Aah! (Grunting) (Loud rumbling) (Squish) Aah! Uhh! (Grunts) Aah! (Blade whooshes) (Grunts) Aah! (Gasps and wheezes) (Grunts) I want you to know, Jack... You died for nothing. (Gunshot) Aah! Uhh! I saved you a bullet! (Panting) (Loud rumbling) (Grunts) You're too late. (Rumbling stops) (Grunts) (Thud) (Panting) Nice work, Dr. Shephard. (Woman speaking indistinctly) What happened to your neck? (Woman speaking indistinctly) Damn it. Okay, he's stable. I'm gonna hop in the shower and see if I can catch up with David before the concert's over. So just give me a call if you need anything. Dr. Shephard? He's waking up. I watched the anesthesiologist. He got the full dosage. Okay. I'll take it from here. Mr. Locke? Can you hear me? John, are you awake? (Chuckles) You just had major surgery, so I need you to try not to move and just relax, okay? It worked. Well, it went well. But we won't know how well you responded to the surgery for... No, Dr. Shephard. It worked. I can feel my legs. John, it's highly unlikely that you would regain sensation that quickly. So let's just take it s... ooh. (Locke) Oh! (Low magnetic zap) (Low magnetic zap) * Ohh. Did you see that? See what? You don't remember? (Low magnetic zap) Um... Mr. Locke, please, just, uh, just relax. What we need to do... what we need to do is go. No, no, no. Hey, John. Will you come with me? We're not going anywhere. You just had extensive spinal surgery... (Voice breaks) And I... I need to go see my son. You don't have a son. What? You don't have a son, Jack. Doctor? Jane, um... Would you give Mr. Locke something to help him rest? I need to go. Jack. I hope that somebody does for you what you just did for me. Oh. Oh, my God. (Groans) (Panting) Oh! (Groans) Ohh. Jack. I'll be fine. Just find me some thread, and I can count to five. (Chuckles) Hey! (Hurley) Oh, my God! What the hell happened? Locke's dead. It's over. (Loud rumbling) (Kate) Uhh! (Groans) (Rumbling stops) It sure don't feel like it's over. Excuse me. Ms. Paik? Yes? Hi. I'm Detective Ford. L.A.P.D. I'm sorry. I heard you were shot, but I didn't expect you to be checking out so soon. Hey. Hello... Detective. Well, I came by to check if you've seen this man. He escaped custody, and we're worried he might come after you. I'm gonna assign a uniform to keep an eye on you until we can AP... you///////////////////// don't have to do that. All due respect, I have a job to do here, ma'am. I need to keep you safe. It's okay. I am safe.</i> We'll see you there. (Door closes) See me where? (Loud rumbling) All right. (Rumbling stops) It ain't pretty, but it's gonna work. I've gotta reset the electronics. (Clicking, gages powering up) (Rapid beeping) Something's wrong with the hydraulics down in the nose wheel. (Gages powering down) Is either one of you guys mechanical? Yeah? I-I worked for a-a contractor renovating apartments for a couple summers. Here, take that... And this... and this. Go down there, make sure everything's hooked up right. Go! (Ben) Lapidus? Yeah? Frank, how's it going over there? What's your timetable? Don't bother me! Sounds like they're making progress. (Loud rumbling) (Rumbling stops) We gotta go now. I don't understand. Locke's dead. Why is this still happening? Because whatever Desmond turned off, I need to turn it back on again. But if it doesn't work... if I don't get it done... you all need to leave now. You need to be on that plane. You can come with us, too, Jack. You don't have to do this. No, I do have to do it. No, you don't. Let this island sink, Jack. (Grunts) Kate, I can't. You think you can get that boat across the channel in time? Yeah, I can manage. (Groans) Good luck to you, James. Thanks, doc, for everything. James! If the island's going down, I'm going down with it. Hugo. You better get going. Unh-unh. No way. You think I'm going down that?</i> I'm with you, dude. (Chuckles) Okay. Kate... You gotta go. Get Claire on that plane. (Voice breaks) Tell me I'm gonna see you again. I love you. I love you. (Crying) Can you fix it? (Whispers) I don't believe in a lot of things, but I do believe in duct tape. Yeah, I think we're good. (Loud rumbling) Let's get the hell out of here. (Kate panting) Yo, chesty. It's Sawyer and Kate. (Metal rattling) Yeah? We're on our way down to the sailboat, then we're heading to you. Don't leave without us!</i> We're gettin' off the ground while there's still ground to get off. So if you wanna go, you better get your asses in gear. (Clatter) Lapidus! Lapidus! Son of a bitch! What now? (Sighs) We jump. - I'll see you at the boat. - Kate! (Telephone ringing in distance) (Exhales deeply) (Woman speaking indistinctly) Hey, you know where I can get some grub around here? Uh, the cafeteria's closed, but there's a vending machine down the hallway. Thanks, doc. Yeah, no problem. (Sighs) (Whirring) (Whirring) (Whirring stops) Oh, come on. (Kicks machine) (Machine rattles) Unbelievable. (Sighs) (Clank) (Grunts) (Footsteps approaching) (Grunts) Can I help you? It's okay. I'm a... I'm a cop. Mm. Maybe you should read the machine its rights. (Laughs) That's funny. Mm. Can I tell you a secret? Please. If you unplug it, and then you plug it back in again, the candy just drops right down. Is that right? Yes, and it's technically legal. Oh. I'll give that a shot. (Machine whirs, electricity powers down) (Thud) Oops. (Laughs) (Clank) It worked. (Low magnetic zap) Oh. Whoa. Did you feel that? We should get coffee sometime. I'd love to, but that machine ate my dollar. I only got one left. We could go Dutch. (Low magnetic zap) (Gasps) * * (low magnetic zap) (Exhales sharply) Juliet. (Voice breaks) Juliet, it's... it's me. (Whispers) Julie. (Crying) It's me, baby. I got you. I got you, baby. (Sniffles) (Cries) Yeah. (Laughing) Kiss me, James. You got it, Blondie. (Man speaking indistinctly) (Sighs) (Indistinct conversations) It's over. Excuse me? The concert. It's over. You looking for someone? Yeah. My son. I was supposed to bring him here tonight. And then I couldn't come, and... (Chuckles) I'm sorry. Where do I remember you from? I stole your pen. (Chuckles) What? Um... Oceanic 815. From Sydney. I bumped into you coming out of the bathroom, and... I stole your pen. And that's how I know you? No. That's not how you know me. (Low magnetic zap) I missed you so much. (Low magnetic zap) (Exhales sharply) (Sighs) Are you okay? What is happening to me? Who... (Sighs) who are you? I don't... I know you don't understand, Jack. But if you come with me, you will. (Birds chirping) (Jack panting and grunting) It's over there. (Loud rumbling) (Rumbling stops) (Hurley) How we gettin' down there? We're not. I'm going alone. Dude, you can't go down there alone. Desmond didn't make it. How the hell are you gonna survive? (Sighs deeply) No. No way. I'm not gonna let you die. Hurley, I'm already dead. You said you'd protect the island! And that's what I'm doing. You're committing suicide! I'm not. This is the way it has to happen. This is what I'm supposed to do. You're not supposed to die! The island needs you!</i> Hurley... It needs you. What? It needs to be you, Hugo. (Voice breaks) I can't. (Crying) It's supposed to be you. It was only supposed to be me so I could do this. But if someone has to take care of the island, if someone has to protect it, then... then it should be you. Hurley... I believe in you. (Sniffles) Alright, I'll take it. But it's only temporary. As soon as you get that light back on, I'm pulling you up, - and I'm giving it right back to you. Deal? - Deal. (Loud rumbling) (Rumbling stops) Do you have anything to drink? (Groans) Anything to drink out of? A... a cup. A canteen. I do. Is that okay? Perfect. (Jack groans) (Grunts) Drink this. Is that it? (Chuckles) Now you're like me. Second time's a charm. It better be, 'cause we sure as hell don't have the battery power for a third time. (Clicking) (Electricity surges) (Engines powering up) Is that good? That, my friends, is pure music. (Grunts) Easy. (Grunts) Easy. Easy. (Loud rumbling) Dude! (Grunts) (Groaning) (Rumbling subsides) (Panting) (Rumbling continues, steam hissing) Desmond! (Rumbling subsides) Desmond! Can you hear me? (Groans) Aah! Ah! (Panting) The light... I put it out. It didn't work. I thought I'd leave this place. I got you. Come on. Come on. Ah! (Both grunting) I'm still here. (Grunts) You were right, Jack. Yeah, well, there's a first time for everything. (Loud rumbling) Aah! Uhh! I have to put it back. It was like a drain. That's what you did? You took that stone out of that hole over there? Jack, you can't. Listen. Even if you turn it back on, it'll kill ya. It has to be me. Desmond, you've done enough. You wanna do something? Go home and be with your wife and son. How about you, Jack? I'll see you in another life, brother. (Sighs) Claire? (Loud rumbling) (Rumbling stops) Oh, that ain't good. Miles, go look out the door! You're gonna be my eyes while I back this out of here. Richard, go tell me what he says. Claire! (Panting) Are you okay? (Engines roaring) (Creaking) (Sighs) Come on! We gotta go! Come on! Claire, come on, please. I can't! Why?! Look at me! This island's made me crazy. I... I don't want Aaron to see me like this. (Sighs) I don't... I don't even know how to be a mother anymore. Listen to me. None of us do. Not at first. But you're not alone. Let me help you. Now come on. Let's go. Are we clear?! Miles, are we clear? Yeah, it looks like it to me! He says we're good. You better pray we are, Ricky boy, 'cause I'm gonna spin her around. Hold on! Sawyer! Tell him to stop! Tell him we're coming! Lapidus! Lapidus! Lapidus, hold on! All right, we're good to go! Let's go! (Engines roaring) (Whispers) What the hell? (Chuckles) (Engines powering down) Boys, we got some late arrivals. Open the door. Come on! (Rumbling and hissing continue) Uhh! (Grunts) (Groaning) Uhh! (Grunts) Uhh! (Groans) (Rumbling and hissing continue) (Groans) Ohh! (Whispers) No. No. No. We're running out of time! (Kate grunting) (Sawyer panting) Way to wait till the last second, Jim. Good to see you, too, Enos. We got 'em! Everybody, buckle up tight! Hold on! (Engines powering up) Here we go, Frank. (Exhales deeply) Come on. Come on. Amen. (Rumbling and hissing continue) (Water trickling) (Rumbling and hissing subside) (Laughing) (Low magnetic humming) (Buzzing, magnetic humming) He did it. The light's back on. Dude, pull. Hang on, Jack! (Continues laughing) Got him! Desmond? No. Jack! Jack! (Brakes squeal) (Shifts gears) (Door closes) (Trunk creaks) (Grunts) Thank you. Hello, Benjamin. Hello, John. Is everyone already inside? Mm. I'm very sorry for what I did to you, John. I was selfish and jealous. I wanted everything you had. What did I have? You were special, John. And I wasn't. Well, if it helps, Ben, I forgive you. Thank you, John. That does help. It matters more than I can say. What are you gonna do now? I have some things that I still need to work out. I think I'll stay here a while. You know, I don't think you need to be in that chair anymore. Mm. Good-bye, Ben. (Door closes) (Water streaming) I think Desmond's gonna be okay. (Grunts) Jack's... gone. Isn't he? (Crying) He did his job, Hugo. It's my job now. (Breathing heavily) What the hell am I supposed to to do? I think you do what you do best. Take care of people. You can start by helping Desmond get home. But how? People can't leave the island. That's how Jacob ran things. Maybe there's another way. A better way. Will you help me? I'm sorry? I could really use someone with, like... experience... For a little while. Will you help me, Ben? I'd be honored. Cool. (Door creaks) Oh! Hey, dude. Hello, Hugo. We're all inside. I don't think I'm coming in. You know... you were a real good number two. And you were a great number one, Hugo. Thanks, dude. I'll see you. (Door creaks and closes) (Shifts gears, turns off engine) Do you know where we are? This is where I was gonna have my father's funeral. He died in Australia. I'm sorry. Why did you bring me here? Because this is where you were gonna have your father's funeral. You can go in around back. Wait. W... where are you going? Inside. I'll be waiting for you there... once you're ready. (Chuckles) Ready for what? To leave. (Grunting) (Closes door) (exhales sharply) (Low magnetic zap) (low magnetic zap) (Sighs) Hey, kiddo. (Gasps) Dad? Hello, Jack. I don't understand. (Voice breaks) You died. Yeah. Yes, I did. Then how are you here right now? (Sighs) How are you here? I died, too. (Crying) It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, son. (Sobbing) (Sighs deeply) (Sniffles) - (muffled voice) I love you, dad. - I love you, too, son. Are you... are you real? (Laughs) I sure hope so. (Laughs) Yeah, I'm real. You're real. Everything that's ever happened to you is real. (Sniffles) All those people in the church... they're all real, too. They're all... They're all dead? (Sighs) Everyone dies sometime, kiddo. Some of them before you, some... long after you. But why are they all here now? Well, there is no "now"... here. (Sighs deeply) Where are we, dad? This is a place that you... that you all made together so that you could find one another. The most important part of your life was the time that you spent with these people. That's why all of you are here. Nobody does it alone, Jack. You needed all of them, and they needed you. For what? To remember. And to... let go. (Sighs) Kate... she said we were leaving. (Whispers) Not leave. No. Moving on. (Sighs) Where are we going? Let's go find out. (Chuckles) We've been waitin' for ya.
