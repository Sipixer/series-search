I burnt my hand...and my muffins. Still hasn't fixed your plumbing yet? It's a work in progress. It's not even literature. It's popcorn. And why isn't it literature, Adam? - I'm dying to know. - There's no metaphor. It's by the numbers, religious hokum-pokum.</i> - No metaphor? - It's science fiction.</i> Now I know why Ben isn't here. Excuse me? I know the host picks the book, but seriously, Julie, he wouldn't read this in the damned bathroom. Well, Adam, I am the host, and i do pick the book, and this, is my favorite book, so I am absolutely thrilled that you can't stand it. Silly me for sinking so low as to select something that Ben wouldn't like. Here I am, thinking that free will still actually exists on... In the doorway, get in the door way. Goodwin! - You see where the tail landed? - Yeah, probably in the water. You run, you can make that shore in 1 h. Ethan, get up there to that fuselage. There may actually be survivors, and you're one of them. A passenger, you're in shock. Come up with an adequate story if they ask. Stay quiet if they don't. Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

Where am I? You don't really think I'm going to answer that, do you? Where are Sawyer and Jack? I'll tell you what. Why don't you just take a nice hot shower? Wake yourself up. Wash the day off you and... start fresh. It's a nice clean towel, shampoo, soap... I'm not showering in front of you. You're not my type. Where are we? Who the hell are you? You ain't gonna talk to me? What, you got more important things to do? Warning. Warning. I wouldn't do that. I want your advice, I'll ask for it. Son of a bitch! Told you. Stop that. Hi, Jack. I'm Juliet. - Hi. - Yes? I'm Jack Shephard. - I'm here for the... - Where's your lawyer? You look pretty. Where's your lawyer? I fired him. Sarah... I'm sorry, for... for pushing us to this place. I know that I... Excuse me, I'm sorry. Yeah? No, not yet. He just got here. I'll call you when I get out. Jack, I'm gonna say this - as simply as I can. - What's his name? - Jack, stop it. - I won't. I'm gonna keep asking you that until you tell me. I don't ask you what you're doing... Just tell me what his name is. I wanna know, who he is. Look, you can have everything, the cars, the house. I don't care. I just... I just wanna know, the name of the man... that is with my wife. Jack? Can you hear me in there? Is that a "yes"? Where are my friends? Come down from the table first. You want me to come down, come in here and get me down. - If you wanna talk, I'm happy... - Tell me where my friends are! I will...if you let go of the chain. You think I'm stupid?! I don't think you're stupid, Jack. I think you're stubborn. Where are my clothes?! Come on, Kate. He's waiting. Sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to put those on, Kate. And if I don't? Then you don't get any coffee. A little tighter. Please? What did you do with Sawyer and Jack? Now, why Sawyer? Why Sawyer what? He's the first one you asked about: "what did you do with Sawyer and Jack?" You don't know me. Of course I don't. I want my clothes back. We burned them. Why did you bring me here? Why did you make me put on this dress? Why are you feeding me breakfast? I brought you here so you'd look out at the water and feel comforted. Comforted that your friends were looking out at the same ocean. I gave you the dress so you'd feel like a lady, and I wanted you to eat your food with a real live fork and feel civilized. I did all those things so that you'd have something nice to hold on to. Because, Kate... the next two weeks are going to bevery unpleasant. Yeah, hi. I met a woman on the train, Sarah, and, she dropped her cell phone, and I don't even know her last name, but your number was in her phone, so I was just wondering... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Forget it. Just give me a minute, dad. I asked you to give me a minute here. What's this? Why are you dialing all the numbers on Sarah's cell phone? Because one of them is him. You gotta stop this, Jack. - It's over. - Not until I know his name, where he works, where he lives. When they first kissed. I wanna know what it is about him. Mrs. Owens, call the operator. Mrs. Owens, call the operator, please. Why is Sarah calling you, dad? I think it's time that you let this go. - Why is she calling you? - Because she was afraid...for you. I wanna know exactly - why the hell she would call you! - She saw that you were slipping. - You were losing your grip. - My grip is not the problem. Which is exactly what's happening here. Jack! Come... I think I know a little something about being obsessive. No, being a drunk is not obsessive. Let it go, jack. What?! If you're trying to talk to me, I can't hear you! Let it go, Jack. I know you're hungry. I brought this for you. This is how it will work. You sit there, across from the door, back against the wall. I open the door and leave the tray. Can I trust you to do that, Jack? I don't want your food. It's a delicious sandwich... I want you to tell the guy who's talking to me through that intercom that he can give it up! Maybe you're hungrier than you think. That intercom hasn't worked in years. What's that for? The button-- what it's for? It's for emergencies. Who's watching me? Are you going to sit against the wall so I can open the door? It's...just off the frying pan. You can have it. What do you do, Jack? What's your profession? I'm a repo man. You know, when people don't pay their bills, I go in for the bank, and I collect their possessions. I'm a people person, so I really love it. Are you married? I never saw the point. What about you? What's your job, besides making sandwiches? I didn't make it. I just put the toothpicks in. When your plane crashed, where were you flying from? Sydney. What were you doing there? I was bringing my father home. Why would you go all the way to australia just to... ...because he was dead. I'm sorry. I'm sure you are. Thanks. You can trust me, Jack. I'm not gonna hurt you. What the hell is going on here? How long would it take to get to your camp? What, you're talking to me now, Chachi? From where they got you, how long a walk was it-- Day? Two days? Hey, what are the people like-- from your plane? Oh, they're just awesome. Last one of you boys came for a visit got tortured by our iraqi. He tortured me, too. Well, hell, he don't know any better. Subject escape. Subject escape. How'd you get out of there? Subject escape. You run that way. - Hold on... - You run that way! Subject escape. Say it! Say it, Karl. I'm...sorry. Sorry I involved you in my breakout attempt. The drugs we gave you when we brought you here have a fairly serious side effect-- dehydration. Your head is probably sore. Your throat is raw, and if you don't eat or drink something soon, you're going to start hallucinating. So you're a doctor, huh? No. I'm a repo woman. No strings attached. You don't have to answer any questions. You don't have to do anything but sit with your back up against the far wall. Let me open that door, put the plate down and leave. I know it feels like you're giving up, like you're losing if you do anything that I ask you to. But you're not. You need to eat. What do you say? Thank you, Jack. Let's take out the epidural catheter and get him startedon a P. C. A. Excuse me just a second. You sure he's ready to self-administer his pain meds? Hello? Dr. Shephard? - Jack? - Give me your cell phone. - What? - I wanna see it. Now. Look where you are, Jack. Just look around you, please. - Okay? - Give me the phone! This is not the place for this. You must be Jack. Why don't you, grab a chair and join us? You... You know me? Yes. Your father's told us all about you. Yeah? What's he told you about me? What'd you tell 'em about me, dad-- that your-- your son never really had it? Not like the old man. I didn't have the will to make it work-- my-- my life, my job, my marriage? What'd you tell 'em about my marriage, dad?! You know how he manages his marriage? A bottle of scotch every night before dinner. Your father has been sober 50 days now. We're very proud of that. Dad! I wonder what-- what helped you turn that corner? You think maybe it was-- a new lady friend? You think maybe that's what it was-- - I will not let you talk to me-- - I will not sleep with my wife Jack, I'm your father. Jack, please, just let it go! Which way out? Don't do this, Jack. Don't. Don't. - Open the door. - No, I can't Jack. I do that, we die. - You're lying to me. - I'm not. - Open the door! - I swear I can't! She's telling the truth, Jack. I swear to god... I will kill her. Okay. Have her open the door, and she dies anyway. We all do. Over here! The button! - What?! - The yellow button! The button! Warning. Gotcha, doc! Reward! Reward! Oh, come on. Unbelievable. Keep movin'. Stick your hands out through the bars. I'll take off your cuffs. They scratched you up pretty bad, didn't they? I'll bring you some antiseptic later. How about you bring mean an ottoman? While you're at it, I could use a blow-dry. You got yourself a fish biscuit. How'd you do that? I figured out your complicated gizmos, that's how. Only took the bears two hours. How many of 'em were there? You okay, freckles? Yeah. You? Just swell. I requested that cage, but whatever. Nice dress. They made me wear it. Are you hungry? It's an aquarium. Excuse me? This thing's for what... sharks? Dolphins, too. We're underwater, aren't we? Yes. Is this one of their... stations-- the-- the Dharma Initiative? They called it the Hydra. So you people are just... whatever's leftover of them? Well, that was a long time ago. It doesn't matter... who we were. It only matters who we are. We know exactly who you are, Jack Shephard. You don't know anything about me. We know that you're a spinal surgeon based out of St. Sebastian's hospital in Los Angeles. I know that you went to Columbia, and you graduated med school a year faster than anyone else. I know that you were married, only once, and that you contested the divorce. I know your father died in Sydney. I know this because I have a copy of his autopsy report. How... - How did you get-- - we got it. What is that? This, Jack... is your life. Do you... is it just about me, or is it about my family, too? My... My friends? It's pretty much about everything. Do you know about my... About my ex-wife? Sarah. Yes, Jack. We know all about her. What would you like to find out? Shephard, someone posted your bail. How'd you... Your dad told me you were here. I called you a cab. So... good-bye. Sarah! What? Is that him? - What difference does it make? - It just does. - It's not gonna change anything. - Look, I wanna know! I need to know who he is. It doesn't matter who he is. It just matters who you're not. Your father... when he called me...to help you... he was so drunk, I could hardly understand him. Look at the bright side. Now you have something to fix. What would you like to find out? Is she... Is she happy? Yes, Jack. She's very happy. Now I'd like to bring you some food and water, but this time I need to know that you'll behave. Can I trust you, Jack?
