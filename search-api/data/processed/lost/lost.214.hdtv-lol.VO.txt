people on this island? I hear them. Out there, in the jungle. They whisper. They've attacked us, sabotaged us, abducted us! We're not the only people on this island, and we all know it! Maybe it's time we stopped blaming us and started worrying about them! They came the first night, took three of us, then they came back and took nine more. They're smart, and they're animals, and they could be anywhere at anytime, and if you think that one gun and one bullet is gonna stop them... think again. Shannon! This is not your island. This is our island, and the only reason you're livin' on it is 'cause we let you live on it. They're getting closer! Move it! Burn those! Shred faster! Hurry up! Sayid! Take these files! Burn them! Keep shredding you cowards! We leave when I say! Stop again, and I'll kill you myself! I'm your commanding, officer, and you will do-- Stop! Get down! Get the hell down! Get down, get down! You, no, no, no, drop your gun on the ground now! Freeze! On the ground now! Stop burning that stuff! Get the hell down! Who's in charge here? I said who's in charge?! Somebody better tell him to stop, or god help me, he's dead! They don't understand, sergeant. They understand. Listen up! I'll fire on three! One, two... Stop shredding or they'll kill you! You! You in charge? - No, I am not. - Who is? There is no commanding officer here. He left two hours ago for Hillah. Your English is good, Abdul, but you're lying, and that ain't so good. That's him, sergeant. Let's go, hombre. Son, we don't want to be here any more than you do, and your pal Saddam had to go marchin' into Kuwait, so here we all are. Buccelli here says you speak English. You ever do any translatin'? Formally? No. Hell, fact you know what "formally" means, well, we're good. Apache helicopter went down in this sector two days ago. Our sources tell us the pilot was captured. It's very important that we get this pilot back. We know he was taken to the local Republican Guard intelligence commander-- a man named Tariq. Do you know him? Yes, he was our commanding officer. You know where he is? When the bombing started, he fled to Hillah. Hillah, huh? Yes, that is right. Welcome to Hillah. Where's Jack? Why? There. See? Go back. I'll deal with this. What? Go back, Ana Lucia, and don't tell anyone what you saw. What are you doing here, Danielle? Looking for you. Where are we going? You said you were looking for me. What was your plan-- to hide in the woods, hoping I would pass you by? I was going to wait until dark, then find you at your tent. Why? We need to keep moving. Not until you tell me where we're moving to. Trust me. The last time we met, you arrive to warn us the others were coming, which they weren't. In fact, it was a diversion to kidnap Claire's baby, so pardon me for not trusting you. This place I'm taking you to-- there is something that will help you, something important. So trust. Take this. If I'm lying, it's yours to use. How much further? Not  far. Ask him where he took the pilot. They want to know where the pilot is. Tell him his mother is a goat. He says he does not know. Look, we know for a fact he interrogated the pilot day before yesterday-- hell, probably in this room. Tell him we get our man back safe and sound, he goes free. They will let you go if you tell them where the pilot is. You are a disgrace. You're an Iraqi soldier! Steal his gun and kill them all. Right there on his belt. You can get a few of them before you are killed. What's he saying? He says he does not know. I was born, but I wasn't born yesterday, son. Now you don't help me out here, someone else will take over, and  that someone, he won't play nice at all. I am sorry. He does not know. Okay. You had your chance. Guards? Lock him back up. This is unbelievable. Hey. Hey, you hear that thing? You hear that frog? The frog? You want to help me find it? What, we ain't friends anymore? What do you got there, Rerun? Nothin'. Yeah, well, you got a spot of "nothin'" on your chin, there. "Dharma initiative ranch dressing." You know, you're supposed to refrigerate that after you open it. Well, actually on the back it says it'll keep at room temperature for up to 7 years. Well,  well, looky who's got a secret stash. Please, dude, you can't tell. What, that you stole food from the group? Now why would I want to do that? Come on, man, please? Son of a bitch. Dude, it's just a tree frog. - Have you seen it? - Yeah. Tell you what-- you help me find that thing, you can keep right on ranch dippin'. We got a deal? How much further? - Danielle? - We're here. And where exactly is "here"? What is that for, Danielle? Help me! Hey! Over here! Wait. - Help! - Sayid, listen to me. Hey! Aah! Over here! Please! Help me! Help me! Don't believe a word he says. Hey! He's one of them. I have no idea what she's talking about. She's crazy. How long has he been up there? Since last night. Please, just cut me down. My name is Henry Gale. I'm from Minnesota. - Please. - He's lying. I'm going to cut him down. Don't. Thank you. You're making a serious mistake. It's okay, it's okay. You're all right. You're all right. Hold on. Take it easy. Oh, no. Wait! Danielle, don't! You could have killed him. If I wanted to kill him, I would have killed him. You shot this man with no provocation. He is one of them! Tie him up. You should take him to your doctor. He's no good to you dead. And then what? You talk to him, Sayid. As I recall, that is what you do. But know this-- he will lie. For a long time, he will lie. I want to talk to you about your buddy Tariq. All right, look, I get it. You're a man who values loyalty. Even doing a little translating for us, you feel like you're doing the wrong thing. I get that, and I respect it. This is what Tariq was doing before he took over command of your intelligence unit. He was the head of a chemical warfare battalion in the north, personally supervised the use of Sarin gas on this village. You recognize it, don't you? You had relatives in that village, didn't you, Sayid? So you know what Sarin gas does. No discrimination. The entire marketplace. Innocent women... children. Enough... Please. Loyalty is a virtue, but unquestioning loyalty-- I don't think that's you. Why  should I believe you? How do you think we knew you had relatives in that village? We liberated your personnel file and Tariq's. All we want is our pilot back, so we can send him home to his family. Tariq will never talk to you. That's why you're gonna have to make him talk to you. John. John, wake up. What? Come out here. Minnesota, huh? That's the question, isn't it? Where am I? - Who are you? - Henry. Henry Gale. Aah! My back! We're going to take it out, but first I want you to relax. How did you get to this island? Four months ago, we crashed, my wife and I. - Crashed in what? - A balloon. We were trying to cross the Pacific. Your wife-- where is she? She died. She got... she got sick three weeks ago. We were staying in a cave off the beach. My shoulder. At least untie my arms! What the hell is going on here? Rousseau trapped him in the jungle. - She believe she's an other. - An "other" what? - You shot him with an arrow? - Do I have a bow? Hey, hey, you with me? What, you were just gonna let him bleed to death? I was trying to get honest answers while he was able to give them... and his wound is far from life-threatening. We should let Jack treat him first, then we'll get our answers. Jack... do not untie him. This is how people get killed in scary movies. If it were a scary movie, I'd be with a hot chick, not you, Barbar. - It's Babar. - How about you shut up, Hammo, or your ranch disorder's gonna be the new lead item on the coconut internet. Fine. Go ahead. Tell everyone the fat guy's been hiding ranch dressing, the fat guy who likes to eat. Yeah, I'm fat. Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat. You think I don't know that? At least people like me. You know what? Find the damn frog by yourself. Hurley, wait! Wait! Hey, Hurley! Look, man, I'm sorry, all right? This frog is killin' me. You gotta help me out... Please. So what do you think? What do you think, John? I think he's pretty convincing. Yes, he is. The real problem is there's no way we can be sure he's telling the truth. That is not necessarily true. Does Jack have the combination to the armory? For now, he does. How long would it take for you to change it? If you're angry, looking for someone to punish... Why  would I need to punish anyone? I want to find out who he is. I want the truth. And I think we both know that Jack will have issues with what must be done in order to get it. So how long, John, to change the combination? A couple minutes, tops. Then I suggest you get started. Did he say anything while you were treat-- No, he didn't. He was in shock. We can't just leave him layin' here, Jack. People will see him and create a panic. Yeah? Well, where do you think we should put him? I say we put him in the armory. It's secure. Better to err on the side of safety, Jack, at least until we can be sure. Okay. For now. All right, pull that cot in here. He shouldn't be on his back. Good idea. Sayid! Hey, what the hell you doin'? What needs to be done. They're letting speak to me alone now? You need to tell me where the helicopter pilot is. This is their new bluff? That you're going to torture me? They think you will do this? Sayid, you are a loyal soldier. The son of a great hero. Do not disgrace your father! You wouldn't dare harm me! You will follow my orders as your commanding officer! Take that bag. Put it over your head and tape it up. Kill yourself, now! That's an order. Do it and die with what little honor you have left. You would have me take my own life... the information means nothing to you! The pilot was executed two days ago. He is buried in a field 4 kilometers from here. I can take you there. Damn it. Sayid, open the door! - Sayid, answer me! - Jack. Why isn't this combination working, John? Did you change it? Yeah. Why would you do that? You're raising an army. What? And why you didn't ask me to help, well, that's your business, but there's only one reason to raise an army, Jack, and that's because we're at war. And like it or not, whatever Sayid has to do behind that door, that's a part of it, too. What if he's telling the truth, John? What if he's not? Get up. What's happening? Here, let me help you. You said you've been here for four months. What? You said you came to this island four months ago, yes? Where am I? Please answer my question. Yeah-- yes, we landed four months ago, maybe more. Who are you? And you were in a cave for all that time? Off the beach... on the north shore of the island. How far from this beach to where you were captured? I don't know. -How many days' walk? - Two-- two days. Why did you stay on the beach for so long? Why wouldn't we? We wanted to be there for flyovers. We had an emergency beacon-- a transmitter. - What kind of transmitter? - An A.D.F. beacon. We wanted to make sure we'd be spotted. Look, whatever you think I am, I'm not. Please-- please just... tell me your name. You wife-- what is her maiden name? Murphy. - Where did you meet her? - University of Minnesota. How did she die? She got sick. She got sick? It started as a fever. After two days, she was delirious... then she died. I don't know why you're asking me all these questions. I don't know why you're treating me this way... why I have to explain to you who I am when you don't tell me who you are. I was 23 years old when the americans came to my country. I was a good man. I was a soldier... and when they left, I was something different. For the next six years, I did things I wish I could erase from my memory, things which I never thought myself to be capable of... but I did come to learn this-- there is a part of me which was always capable. You want to know who I am? My name is Sayid Jarrah... and I am a torturer. Where is it? There it is. Gotcha. Dude, nice catch. Well, I'll be damned. All that noise from this tiny critter. Kind of reminds me of a turtle I once had. His name was Stewart. He ran off when I was 10. Well, that's what mom said. I kinda think she threw him out. Well, you're a happy little fella, ain't ya? I have an idea. Why don't I take him far from here, two beaches away? Maybe I'll finda Mrs. Tree frog. That way, he won't keep you up anymore, and everyone's happy. Yeah,  that's one idea. Here's another. Dude. I hear with a little ranch, they taste just like chicken. Give you a hand? - Jack, I know this-- - Shut up. Where are the pliers? Tell me about this balloon. What? This balloon that brought you here with your wife-- tell me about it. What do you want to know? Everything. She's 140 feet high, 60 feet wide... and when she's up in the air, 550,000 cubic feet of helium and 100,000 of hot air keep her up. And if you could look down on her, you'd see a big, yellow smiley face on top. Why would you travelin that way? Because I was rich, because... it was my dream... and Jennifer thought it would be neat. You were rich. I guess I'm thinking of things in the past tense now. How's that for optimism? What did you do to become so rich? -I sold my company. - What kind of company? - Mining. - What did you mine? We mined nonmetallic minerals. I know, everyone wanted to talk to me at cocktail parties. Give me your hands. Give me your hands! Where is she buried? - What? - Listen to me. You said you buried your wife. Tell me where. - What are you gonna-- - Wwhere?! In the jungle! By the balloon, in the jungle. How deep? How deep did you dig the grave? I don't... How deep? How many shovelfuls of earth? Did you use your hands? How long did it take you?! - I don't remember! - You would remember! You would remember how deep! You would remember every shovelful, every moment! You would remember what it felt like to place her body inside. You would remember if you buried the woman you loved. You would remember, if it were true! Did you... did you lose someone? Did you lose someone here on the island? Did you lose someone, too? What happened to her? It was an accident. It was an accident. The woman responsible thought she was someone else, someone coming to hurt her. Someone like you! Just-- just-- this is all a mistake. Slow down here, okay? Hurting me isn't gonna bring her back. You know what I lost! Tell me the truth! Tell me who you are! No! No! No! Help! Stop! Tell me the truth! Tell me who you are! Sayid! Sayid! Jack. - Open it. Open it now. - Jack, this has to happen. Open that damn door, you understand me?! You open it now! No. Now! What do you want me to say?! Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it! Just-- please... I want you to tell me the truth! Open the door. - Let go of me, Jack. - Or what? You want to pushthe button? Open the door. It's under a minute now, John. You better think fast. - You wouldn't. - What? I wouldn't what? If we don't... you would risk everyone's lives? You talked me into pushing that button once, John, but it's yours now. You're the onewho won't risk it, you. Me? I don't think anything's gonna happen when we get down to zero. Jack... You want to see what's gonna happen? Let's just see what's gonna happen. Who are you?! Who are you?! Okay, okay, okay, right, 15, left-- You think I'm stupid? You open it! - He's lying! - Not like this! I'll tell you whatever you want! He's lying! He's lying! That's enough! What the hell was that? He is one of them. Yeah? Did he tell you that? - No. - Then how do you know? Because I know. He is one of them. I think that's what Rousseau thought about you once, Sayid. If I'm not mistaken, she strapped you down, she shocked you, all because she thought you were one of them. - He is. - What? He is one of them. To Rousseau, we're all "others." I guess it's all relative, huh? You got a wife? Kids? I'll take him. It's over. We're pulling out, not going to Baghdad. So your man Saddam gets to stay in power, which means you, in all likelihood, will remain in his employ. Guess you're lucky to have a new skill set you can use. What you made me do, no human being should ever have to do to another. One of these days... there will be something you need to know. And now... you know how to get it. I will never do that again. Yeah. Good luck to you, Sayid. Bus fare back to Ramadi. Let's move out. There is a man down in the hatch... a stranger captured by Rousseau. I beat him. I beat him badly. Why are you telling me this, Sayid? Jack asked me how I knew-- knew for sure that this man was lying, how I knew for sure that he was one of them, one of the others. I know because I feel no guilt for what I did to him. But there is no way I can ever explain that to Jack or even Locke... because both of them have forgotten. Forgotten? What? That you were strung up by your neck and left for dead, that Claire was taken and kept for days, during which God only knows what happened to her, that these people, these "others", are merciless... and can take any one of us whenever they choose.
