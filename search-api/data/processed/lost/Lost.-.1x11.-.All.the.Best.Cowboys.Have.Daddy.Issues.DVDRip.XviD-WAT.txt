- l told you l'd take care of you. - Thanks. You're quite welcome. - Listen to me. - Sayid. We're not alone. l was sleeping, and l woke up, and he was trying to hurt my baby. - We gotta find out who everyone is. - A census. - Lance! - Sorry? - Your name's Lance? - Ethan. Dude, that's right. l want you to take these. They're very mild. You think l'm making this up? lt was safe at the beach. lt's not safe here. - What did you say? - We got a problem. The census. l interviewed everyone. One isn't in the manifest. He wasn't on the plane. Ethan. - [Kate] Who wasn't on the plane? - Ethan. He's not on the passenger manifest. - Where is he? - l saw him yesterday... - Has anyone seen Ethan? - Yeah, he went to get some wood. Took off on the path to the beach. ls he okay? What happened? - Where's Charlie? - What? Where's Charlie? He went after Claire. Jack! She was moving back to the beach. Claire. That's hers. What happened? Where are they? l don't know. Footprints. At least three distinct sets all over the place. lt looks like there might have been a struggle. What? What is it? Drag marks here, and here. Claire and Charlie. They were together. l think they've been taken. Claire! Charlie! [Locke] Jack! Jack! Shh. The tracks are still fresh. This doesn't make any sense. How could one man drag two people, one pregnant? You're asking the wrong question. Not how, why? - You think it was Ethan? - Feels like it was Ethan. By himself? How? We can't account for all of our people. And more importantly, who's to say they're even our people? - What? - Sayid said there were others. - Sayid said we're not alone. - Semantics. Sayid's injured. We don't even know where he went. - This is what the ground is telling me. - So, which way? Jack, we don't know what's going on here. - We know enough. - We need to prepare. We could be back at the caves, organize a search party... Which way did they go, Locke? [both panting] [beeping] - [woman] Stats are dropping. - [Jack] Come on. - [man] She's bleeding. - [Jack] Got the artery almost there. - [man] Arrest. - [flatline tone] [Jack] One milligram epi. Let's get the crash cart! All right, artery's sealed. Close her up. - Charged? - [woman] Charged. Clear. - [Jack] Charged? - [woman] We're charged. [Jack] Clear. [flatline tone] Come on. Come on back now. Come on now. Come on back. Come on. [man] Call it. Come on, baby. Come back. Come on, baby. Come on now. You can do this. Come on. Call it, Jack. [panting] lt's over. Call it. [panting] You call it. [Kate] You let him go alone? Don't worry, l'll catch up. What's the word from the beach? Nothing. Nobody has seen him. - l'm coming with you. - l figured you might. What are you doing? We need to get back to the beach. You're forming a search party. Can l help? [Shannon] lt's a island. There's no choppers. How exactly are you gonna find them? By following Ethan's trail. No one can walk without leaving signs, bending grass, breaking twigs, especially with captives in tow. And yes, l could use another hand if you're up for it. - l'm up for it. - Then let's get moving. l could take Vincent. He can sniff something that belonged to Charlie, - and l can help. - l said no, man. Hey, Locke. A lot of us don't wanna sit here waiting for news. Thanks, but we're set. - Anyone else is gonna slow us down. - Okay. Maybe l'll just put together another party. Good idea. We're going north. You go south. [dog barks] Come on. [birds flapping wings] [panting] [door slams] Never thought l'd see the day, Jack. You barge into my OR, you work on my patient. - You didn't have to do this. - l don't have to do anything. Yeah, of course you don't. l chose to do this procedure. This emergency procedure because when this girl crashed in the ER, - they called me. - l was right upstairs. You should've stayed. How did you find out? One of the nurses came to get me. Who? Oh, thank God l have you and some anonymous nurse to rescue me. She told me your hands were shaking. - My hands were not... - You cut her artery. She was in a car crash, Jack. Her insides were a mess. - They called me. - You made a mistake. l don't care whether they called you, you made a mistake. Are you lecturing me? You tell me, if you were upstairs, and l was in a restaurant having lunch, then why did they call me? How many drinks did you have at lunch, Dad? [Locke] Jack! Jack? Good thing you were going in a circle. Not much of a search grid, but we never would have found you otherwise. Did you find anything? No. You should go back to the caves... Sayid's leg. l dressed Sayid's leg. You found me. We can find Charlie and Claire. Do we have a trail? - Jack, this was my fault. - What? l hunted with Ethan, l spent time with him. l never sensed anything... ...off. For everything l know about hunting and tracking, whoever he is, he knows more. lf we catch him, l don't want anything to happen to the only physician on the island. So go back, be the doctor. Let me be the hunter. Can we go now? Follow me. l'm trying to help, and the guy tells me ''Go south''? Like what? l'm gonna get in his way or something? We're all tweaked. Locke's feeling it like the rest of us. l got five guys who are going with me. Putting our necks on the line to find Charlie and Claire. l'm saying, l'm sick of being treated like a second-class citizen around here because Mount Baldy can bag a boar. [Walt] He knows a lot more than how to catch a boar. Mr. Locke's a warrior. He can hunt, he can track stuff, and he's the only one who brought knives. So if it were me, l'd listen to him. Well, l don't want you to. You understand? You stay with Hurley. l might not be a warrior, but l am going south. Back home, l'm known as something of a warrior myself. [panting] We mark our progress by line of sight. Tie these off so we don't get lost. You can lead us back to camp, right? lf nothing happens to me. Maybe l'd better take marker detail. - Anything? - Not yet. - lf you can't find the trail... - l'll pick it up again. We need to rest, get our clarity back. You're gonna take a break? lt's gotta be almost 4<i>:</i>00. - When the sun sets... - lt's 4<i>:</i>25. And, yes, l'm taking a break. [Kate] Can l talk to you for a sec? Would it kill you to give the guy a little space? lt might. - Stop that. - What? That. What's going on? l didn't believe her. - Claire. l gave her a sedative. - Jack... She told me someone was after her, she was being attacked, and l... She just seemed so out of it. l thought that her pregnancy was amping up her stress, and l... l didn't believe her. [Boone] Jack! What is it? - Look familiar? - lt's Charlie's. You think it just came off? No. He's leaving us a trail. They went this way. [Locke] l'm not so sure. There's another trail here. - What do you mean? - These are footprints. People moved off this way. Charlie's leaving these for us. They went that way. [Kate] Unless Charlie isn't the one leaving them. lf Ethan knows we're behind him, he could be setting up a dummy trail. Take off in one direction, double back in his own footprints. - Wait, now you're a tracker? - You're just full of surprises. So we've got two trails. Let's split up. l'll take that one. We should stay together. Why? We've got two trails, and apparently two trackers. Be careful. - Who got taken by what? - Charlie and Claire. - They think Ethan took 'em. - Ethan took 'em? Yeah. Took 'em why? And who the hell's Ethan? l don't know. He wasn't on the list thing, the manifest. Ever think he might have lied about his name? lt's stupid to lie about your name. All righty, Tattoo. Where do you think Ethan came from? Maybe he was already on the island before we were. [chuckles] Got yourself one hell of an imagination, kid. There could be lots of other people. So a tribe of evil natives planted a ringer in the camp to kidnap a pregnant girl and a reject from VH-1 has-beens. Yeah, fiendishly clever. And why am l getting the news from a 6-year-old? - l'm 1 0. - Okay, then it must be true. lf you don't believe me, ask Sayid. He said we're not alone. Sayid's back? Red shirt. Huh? [Boone] Red shirt. You ever watch <i>Star Trek?</i> Oh, not really. The crew guys that would go down to the planet with the main guys, the captain and the guy with the pointy ears. They always wore red shirts, and they always got killed. - Yeah? - Yeah. Sounds like a piss-poor captain. What do you do in the real world, Mr. Locke? - lt's John. - John. Why don't you guess? You're either a taxidermist or a hit man. l was a... ...regional collections supervisor for a box company. A box company? They made boxes. Yeah, right. - Please slow down! - You said they went this way. l think they went this way. l'm not as good at this as Locke is. So where'd you pick up the tracking skills, Kate? Was that before or after you were on the run? [panting] - l'm trying to help. - You know what might help? A little honesty. Just give me something real. Anything. My dad was in the army. Ranger Battalion. He was stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington State. We'd go hiking together. One day we spent eight hours tracking deer. Being in the woods, it was like... lt was like his religion. That was real. Anything you wanna share? Well, thanks for coming in, Jack. Have a seat. - What's it say? - The truth. A patient was brought to the ER following a car accident, rushed into surgery with internal bleeding. You joined me, and in spite of our most heroic efforts, the patient succumbed to her injuries. Looks like you fixed everything but the patient. You had no business being in OR. You think l would have walked in there - if l couldn't handle it? - You've done it before. That's right, because l am capable of making those... How can you say that after what happened? - The problem is not... - You were impaired. l know my limits. - l won't sign this. - You were part of a team, Jack. l'm not the only one on the hook. You called me off. You were the surgeon of record when she died. Look, accidents happen in surgeries all the time. That's the truth, and you know it. But if you contradict this report, if you mention alcohol, well, that's the only fact that's gonna matter. They'll strip me of my license. Yes. They will. [sighs] l know... l have been hard on you. But that is how you make a soft metal into steel. That is why you are the most gifted young surgeon in this city. l mean, this... this is a career that is all about the greater good. l've had to sacrifice certain aspects of my relationship with you so that hundreds and thousands of patients will live because of your extraordinary skills. l know it's a long... ...long time coming. What happened yesterday, l promise you, will never happen again. After all that l've given... This isn't... This is not just about my career, Jack. lt's my life. Thank you, son. Thank you. Well, well, well. l don't know if you lslams got a concept of karma, but l get the sense this island just served you up a platter of cosmic payback. - What do you want? - Dr. Do-Right doesn't trust me with his antibiotics, so l gotta hump it up here every day to get my meds. You know, a less magnanimous man than l might be thinking he could beat the living snot out of you - without fear of reprisal. - You want a shot, take it. Know that l left this camp out of shame for what l did to you. lt was never my intention to return. Sorry, fresh out of sweet forgiveness. lf it wasn't your intention to return, then why did you? l was taken prisoner by the French woman. One who's sending out a distress signal for 1 6 years? - She's alive? - She was on a science expedition. - She said they shipwrecked. - She alone? She said that there are others on this island. - Her people? - No. She believed they had all gotten sick. She murdered her entire team. Right. - These others, who are they? - l don't know. - She's never seen them. - She's never seen them, - but she knows they're there? - lf you believe her. Do you? Maybe. Maybe not. But on my way back, l heard something in the jungle, - surrounding me. - Something like what? Have you got something to say to me, Sawyer? Or are you going to ask me questions you know l don't have the answers to? Tide's coming up the beach. The plane hull's almost in the water. l kept your signal fire burning. - Crap. - Your blots can't get in. l know my blots can't get in. - My roll. - Yahoo. l need a four-three. Dude, would you please roll? - Yes! - No! Your turn. lt's okay. l wasn't good when l started playing, either. l didn't just start playing. l took 1 7th in a tournament once. 1 7th is not very good. No, 1 7th is very good. Come on, double sixes, double sixes. - Yes! - You gotta be kidding me. - l'm lucky. - No one is that lucky. My dad said l was the luckiest person he knew. Really? Not Michael. Brian, my other dad. Yeah. Um... Yes! Yes! One more game. Double or nothing. l can't. l got a meeting. - A meeting? - Yeah, a meeting. You owe me $20,000. You'll get it. [Boone] lt's been about 1 5 minutes since we've seen any sign. - What are we following? - [Locke] My gut. [Boone] Great. So, Boone, what do you do in the real world? l run a business. What kind of business? lt's a wedding thing. Huh? My mother has this empire. The Martha Stewart of matrimony. l run one of the subsidiaries. So, who's running it now? l guess it doesn't matter, does it? l'm sure there are people who can handle it temporarily. lt's gonna start raining in one minute. - One minute? - Give or take a few seconds. - You should head back. - What? Trail's been cold, dangerous terrain ahead. You'll make it back before dark. - And you? - l take care of myself. - No. - l admire your courage... l'm not heading back. All right. [rain begins to fall] They teach you how to predict the weather at a box company? l guess we were right. Where to now? [woman screaming] [screaming continues] [Kate] Jack! Jack, where are you going? - Didn't you hear her? - Hear who? [straining] - [grunting] - Jack! [grunting] lf you do not stop following me, l will kill one of them. - [groans] - Do you understand? No more warnings. [over PA] Blue team to ICU, please. - Dr. Shephard. - Andrea. Andrea. That man that my father's talking to. - Who is that? - That's her husband. He's threatening to sue. Sir, l'm very sorry. [Kate] Jack! - Are you okay? - How long was l out? l don't know, few minutes. You slipped with all the rocks. - Ethan. - What? - Ethan was here. - You banged your head. - No, no. He was here. - You have to stop. The rain has washed away the trail. Even if he was here, you've got... - l'm not letting him do this. - Not letting him? [Jack] Not again. [Jack's father] She had massive internal hemorrhaging. We realized that her blood pressure was continuing to drop precipitously. At which point, the patient went into cardiac arrest. Of course, every effort was made to resuscitate her, but the severity of her injuries, the amount of internal bleeding made that impossible. ln my professional opinion, ladies and gentlemen, and that's all l have... ...by the time l was called in, the damage was irreversible. Okay. Thanks, Christian. - Sorry about this formality. - Of course. Just one final detail. You were aware of the patient's pregnancy - when you went into the procedure? - [Christian] Absolutely. The patient's husband had informed the attending in the ER. lt was, however, extremely early in the pregnancy so our primary focus had to be on the mother. Okay, l think we're done here. Our final report will be filed. Okay. l need to... [clears throat] ...revise my statement. l didn't come in until well into the procedure. Jack. l was warned by one of the nurses that my father was operating... - ...under the influence. - Jack, this is not... By the time l got there, it was clear my father was not only incapacitated, but that he had also... ...severed the patient's hepatic artery, which, in my professional opinion, caused the crisis which led to her death. No! [struggling] We gotta cut him down. Hold on, Charlie. Hold on there. l can't reach! Pull him over! [Jack] Harder! [breathing fast] He's not breathing. [Jack] Come on, breathe. Breathe, Charlie, come on. Breathe! Come on. Come on. Come on! Come on. Jack. No, Jack. Come on, Charlie! Come on. Come on, Charlie. Come on! Come on, Charlie. Come on! Come on! Jack. Jack, he's... Jack, stop. He's not coming... [sobbing] lt's okay. - No. - Jack. - Jack! - Come on. - Stop! - Come on. [loud gasp] [coughing] [Jack] Yeah. Just breathe. Breathe. That's it. Just breathe. Just breathe deep. Breathe deep. There you are. You're okay. [tearfully laughing] [Walt] Dad! They brought Charlie back, but he hasn't said anything since he came back. They find Claire? Does that hurt? How's your breathing? Charlie. You gotta talk to me. We're gonna go look for Claire the moment the sun comes up. And l could really use your help. l mean, anything that you can tell me about... ...what you remember, where you were going. Did you see or hear... l didn't see anything. Hear anything. l don't remember... ...anything. Claire. What? That's all they wanted. [Jack] ''They.'' All they wanted was Claire. [Shannon] They aren't back yet. l'm sure they just made camp for the night. lf there's anyone on this island your brother's safe with, it's Locke. [Boone] Are we lost? No, Boone, we're not lost. Sorry, it's just... l don't see how you can still be following his trail. l think we should go back, man. - Don't you feel it? - Feel what? lt. All right, John... - l'm gonna follow the strips back. - Suit yourself. Boone. You need this more than l do. [metallic thud] What is that? [metallic thudding] Steel. Could that be part of the plane? Part of the wreckage? [metallic thudding] [hollow metallic thud]
