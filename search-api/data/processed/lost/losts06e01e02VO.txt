It always ends the same. It only ends once. Anything that happens before that is just progress. I'm not gonna kill jacob, ben. You are. Do what I asked you to, ben, I want you to understand one thing. You have a choice. (weakly) they're coming.

(laughs) how about th? Hey, um, do you mind me asking, How exactly did a guy like you get to o a major corporation? I won the lottery and I like chicken, So I bought it. Oh. Good. Good for you. You know, you really shouldn't tell people you won the lottery. Yeah? Why not? Cause they'll take advantage of you. That's why not. Thanks for the advice, dude, but it's not gonna happen. It's not, huh? Nope. Nothing bad ever happens to me. I'm the luckiest guy alive. (loudly) what just happened? I found a flashlight. Dude, who cares? The sky just went from day to night. What happened?! I think we moved through time. How do you know that? White flash. Headache. Can't hear. Happened to me before. What about jack and everyone else? Did they move through time, too? I don't know. They took one of the other vans and went up to the worksite. (sawyer shouts indistinctly) and then I heard gunfire-- Shh! You said that our plane would never crash on this island!</i> You hear that, dude? It's sawyer. Stay here with sayid. (sawyer shouting indistinctly) The bomb must've gone off. You think an atom bomb went off, we'd still be standing here?! I don't know. That's right! You don't! For once, you don't know!</i> (jin) jack! Sayid needs help. Where is he? With hurley at the van. Two minutes away. (muffled, weak voice) help. He's still bleeding. We don't know what to do. Help me. So what do you say, doc? Got another great idea to save sayid? Maybe there's a nuke laying around. Hey, shut up! Help. Juliet! James? Oh, my god. Juliet! (coughs and gags) Oh, god. Oh, god, this is gross. (coughing and gagging) (wheezing) Don't worry, dude. Everything's gonna be fine. (weakly) when I die... (groans) What do you think will happen to me? Just--just try not to talk, dude. (inhales sharply) I've tortured more people than I can remember. I murdered. Wherever I'm going... (whispers) it can't be very pleasant. Sayid, come on. I deserve it. (leaves rustling) (rustling stops) hello? Jin? (wheezes) Jin! (leaves rustle) I've got a gun! (rustling stops) And I know how to shoot it! (leaves rustle) (rustling stops) (leaves rustling) Hello, hugo. You got a minute? (speaks indistinctly) (both chuckle) (speaks korean) (speaks korean) You're wasting your time, man. This plane goes down in the ocean way out here, I think our chances of survival are exactly zero. Actually, in calm seas w-with a good pilot, We could survive a water landing. And, uh, the fuel tanks are buoyant enough To keep us afloat until we got in the life rafts. What? No, it's just impressive you know that. What were you doing in australia? Business or pleasure? Pleasure. You? I went down to get my sister out of a bad relationship That it turns out she didn't want to get out of. So... Here I am. So what, you were just down under for vacation? Actually, I went on a walkabout. Really? Like--like crocodile dundee? (chuckles) no, not exactly. But--but, uh, it was pretty intense. We--we spent ten days in the outback And, uh, nothing but our packs and our knives. We slept under the stars and made our own fires, Hunted our own food. Wow. I wouldn't make it two days without my cell phone. (both chuckle) You're not pulling my leg, are ya? Why would I pull your leg? (chuckles) This thing goes down, I'm sticking with you. (fire crackling) (cuts material) You can stop staring at the fire. Jacob's gone. He's gone. Why didn't he fight back? Why did he let me just kill him? I guess he knew that he was beaten. Ben... I want you to go outside And tell richard that I need to talk to him. Talk to him about... What? That's between me and richard. There's no other reason. (bram) no, that's not how it's gonna be. You have to--you're not going in there. (speaks indistinctly) (speaks indistinctly) listen to me. I already did. Now I'm asking you to... (speaks indistinctly) body over by the... (speaks indistinctly) Just back up a little. Okay? (richardnd bram speaking indistinctly) Who are they? Other than the fact That I know they were on the ajira flight with us, All I know is they knocked me out And dragged my ass to some cabin, Which they promptly burned, then... Brought me here along with the dead guy in the box. They say they're the good guys. (both speaking indistinctly) I'm not buying it either. Listen to me. Hey! Listen to me, and listen carefully. No one goes in there unless jacob invites them in. Richard, that's why we're here, because jacob invited us. Asking me what's in the shadow of the damn statue Doesn't mean you're in charge. Then who is? Richard. (panting) Ben. What happened in there? Everything's fine. John wants to speak to you. Is jacob all right? I'm sorry. Who are you? Answer her question, ben. Well, of course jacob's all right. They're both together inside. John just wants to talk to you. John wants to talk to me? That's right. Richard, what are you doing? I don't understand. Well, I'm happy to talk to john. But before I do, maybe you should talk to him first. (all grunting) Hang on, juliet! We're coming! (kate) uhh! (grunts) Jin. Flashlight. We can move this beam. I think I can get down there. Uhh! (groans) (grunts) Uhh! Too heavy. We need something to pull it. Jin! The van! There's chains in it. Go get 'em! Where you going, dude? And what are you doing here? I mean, I meet you in a taxi, And you know everything about me, And you give me a plane ticket, Which just so happens to get me back on this island. How'd you know that was gonna happen? Can you hear me? Why aren't you answering my questions? Look, my friend jin's gonna be here any second, So you better stop ignoring me-- your friend jin won't be able to see me. Why not? Because I died an hour ago. Sorry, dude. That sucks. Thanks. How'd you die? I was killed by an old friend who grew tired of my company. You want me to do something crazy again, don't you? No. I need you to save sayid, hugo. Well, that's why jin went to go get jack, to-- jin can't help him. You need to take sayid to the temple. That's the only chance he's got. And the rest of them will be safe there. The temple? I'm supposed to know what that is? Jin knows. Tell him to take you to the hole in the wall Where he was with the french team. Through that opening, you can get into the temple. You still have that guitar case I gave you? Yeah. Bring it. Who are you, dude? I'm jacob. (leaves rustle) Hurley! Help me with sayid. We have to get him into the van. Juliet needs our help. Come on! We have to go! Jin, if I asked you To take me to where there's like a he in the wall, Where you went with the french team, Would you know what I was talking about? Yes. Good. (van approaching) I'll get the chain. (tools clatter) Juliet? Stop it. Stop, sawyer. The van is here. The chains are comin'. (chain rattles) She ain't makin' any more noises. She knows we're here. She's probably just resting. Juliet! If she dies, I'll kill him. (chain rattles) Ladies and gentlemen, nothing to be alarmed about,</i> But if there is a doctor on board</i> Would you please press your call button? (bell dings) Sir, you're a doctor? Yes. Could you come with me, please? We appreciate your help. A passenger went into the restroom About half an hour ago, and he's not responding when we knock. This man's a doctor. If he's unconscious in there-- I-I think he tampered with the lock. It's--it's jammed or something. I don't know. Can I be of assistance? Excuse me. (door bangs) He's not breathing. What's goin' on back there, earhart? Yeah, everything's fine, sir. Please just stay in your seat. - Yeah. Looks peachy. Sir, I'm gonna need your help. - What can I do? I need you... Hold this over his no and mouth. Hold it there, and do not let any air escape. Okay. Now? Yes, now. (sighs) something's blocking his air passage. (grunts) we have to open it up. I need, uh, something sharp-- a razor. I got a pen. A pen? It's regulation. There's nothing sharp. A pen! Just a pen. I had a pen in my jacket but it's gone. Damn it. (grunt (strained voice) I got it. I got it. (sighs deeply) (panting) (coughing) (gasping) Relax. Just relax. Breathe. (breathing heavily) I'm alive? (chuckles) yeah. Ah, you're alive. Terrific. (chain rattling) Got it? Okay, jin! We're good down here! (starts engine) hit it! (revs engine) (all grunting) (revs engine) Give me the flashlight. (metal clanking) (panting) (grunts) Juliet. (metal clanks) Okay. (panting) Juliet. Come here. Okay. (metal clanks) Juliet? (sets down flashlight) Juliet, hey. I'm here. Come on, baby. Hey, come on, wake up. Wake up. Hi. Hey. (chuckles) Okay. Where... Where... Where are we? Don't worry about that. You're fine. I gotta get you out of here, okay? It didn't work. We're still on the island. It's okay. It's okay. I just gotta get this loose enough to get you out, okay? I need to get you-- no, I hit the bomb. You're still here. You what? You hit the bomb? Why? (whispers) I wanted you to be able to go home. (crying) I wanted to make it So that you never came to this damn isld. And it didn't work. Shh. Don't you worry about that. You're gonna be okay. I'm gonna get you outta here, And we're all gonna go home together. You hear me? Sawyer? Even if I could get the bullet out, the bleeding won't stop. There's nothing I can do for him. There's something I can do. There's a temple. If we can get sayid there, we can save him. And you know this how? This guy jacob told me just before we got here.</i> Who's jacob? Does it matter? Can you fix sayid, jack? No. Then you're gonna have to let me do it. (surf rolling) Ben, you need to talk to me. I-I can't stop them unless you tell me what happened in there, What happened to jacob. You and I have known each other for 30 years, ben. I'm asking you this as a friend. You wanna know what happened, richard? Why don't you go inside and find out? What are you doing? We're goin' in, and he's comin' with us. Where's richard? He's not coming. Then who is that behind you? Where's jacob? Jacob is dead. (cocks gun) Who are you? Don't worry about me. (knife clatters) Let's talk about you. I'm assuming that you are... What, jacob's bodyguards, And that you came all the way to this island to protect him? Well, I have good news. Jacob burned up right there in that fire. Therefore there's nothing left for you to protect. You can go. You're free. (gunfire) Kill him! Spread out! Get him! (bram) where is he?! (rattling and growling) (gunshots) (man) uhh! Aah! (both) uhh! (rattling and growling continues) Aah! (growling loudly) Aah! Uhh! (growling loudly) Aah!

(sighs deeply) I have to tell you something. It's really, really important. You tell me. Tell me. Julie? (voice breaks) ba--you tell m (sniffles) Oh, god. I'm here. I'm--I'm... (sobs) You did this. You should've let that happen, man. I was supposed to die. Don't take it personally. Some people just don't know how to say thanks.

You're not translating anhing I say to him, Which means you totally understand me, dude. I don't like the way english tastes on my tongue. (speaks japanese) When's Jacob getting here?

You're the monster. Let's not resort to name-calling. (wood cracks) (grunts) You used me. You couldn't kill him yourself, So you made me do it. I didn't make you do anything. You should know... He was very confused when you killed him. I seriously doubt that jacob was ever confused. I'm not talking about jacob. I'm talking about john locke. Do you wanna know what he was thinking while you... Choked t life out of him, Benjamin? What the last thought that ran through his head was? "I don't understand." Isn't that just the saddest thing you ever heard? But it's fitting in a way. Because when john first came to the island, He was a very sad man. A victim Shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do-- Even though they were right. He was weak And pathetic and irreparably broken. But despite all that, There was something admirable about him. He was the only one of them who didn't want to leave. The only one who realized How pitiful the life he'd left behind Actually was. Hmm. What do you want? Well, that's the great irony here, ben, Because... I want the one thing that John Locke didn't. I want to go home. (water gurgling) (whispers) good-bye, dude. If you ever wanna talk, I'm around. What? Nothing. (grunts) (sighs) Hey. Where are we? We're in a temple. We got caught by the others again. Yeah. Only this time, they're protecting us. I think.

(chuckles) try me. They lost my father. I'm sorry? He died in australia a couple days ago, And, um, I flew down to get him. My condolences. Yo. The coffin was supposed to go on thelane in Sydney, But it didn't. Apparently, he's somewhere in transit, Which is their way of saying They have no idea where the hell he is. Well, how could they know? Well, they're the ones that checked him in. I mean, they've gotta have some kind of tracking system. No, I'm not talking about the coffin. I mean, how could they know where he is? They didn't lose your father. They just lost his body. Either way, your story beats the hell out of mine. All that was in my suitcase was a bunch of knives. Thanks. You some kind of salesman? Yeah, somethin' like that. Well, it's nice talking to you. I-I hope you find that coffin. (chuckles) I hope you find your knives. Yeah, thanks. Mind if I ask what happened to you? I'm sorry. I'mnly asking because I'm a spinal surgeon. I-I didn't mean to... Oh, no, don't worry about it. Uh... Uh, surgery isn't gonna do anythg to help me.

We need to speak to you privately. If you've got something to say to me, then say it. Otherwise, just leave me alone. I don't think you're understanding me here. I'm asking politely.
