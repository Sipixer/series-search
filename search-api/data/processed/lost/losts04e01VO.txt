Hey, are you on a boat? what--what boat? Your boat. I'm not on a boat. Uh, na-Naomi, the parachutist. Who? who's Naomi? I've got it. I've got a signal! it's gonna work. It's happening. we're gonna get off of this island. Is Desmond there? Penny! No! I'm telling you, Making that call is the beginning of the end. Who is this? who is this? I'm one of the survivors of oceanic flight 815. Can you get a fix on our location? Sit tight. we'll be right there. It's almost 30 minutes now Since the start of this high-speed chase. We still have no information About who's driving this vehicle. Jeff, can you tell us where the chase started? Ruth, we're hearing reports that the pursuit began Near the La Brea Area, Then traveled through a warehousing district South of the 10 freeway. can you see how many people are in the car? It appears to be just the one-- the driver. We're not sure if that's the owner of the car. What you're seeing here Are pictures of the 10 freeway south of downtown. Is that a Camaro, Jeff? Yes, it looks like a vintage, early '70s model. Damn it. Show us your hands! Roll down the window and show us your hands now! Now slowly open the door with your left hand. Get out of the car! Turn around... slow! On the ground! Now! Stop! Don't you know who I am?! stop! wait! Don't you know who I am?! I'm one of the oceanic six! I'm one of the oceanic six! So five mimutes before you let ten cruiser on a chase across the city you're minding your own business In a convenience store, Until you see something and freak out. Mr. Reyes, why'd you run like that? Who'd you see in there? Listen, buddy, I know you saw somebody in that store That made you run away and go on a high-speed-- I wasn't running away from anyone. If you think I care that you're a celebrity, You crashed your Camaro in the wrong neighborhood. I'm not a celebrity. Is that why you kept shouting, "hey, I'm one of the oceanic six"? You wanna know a funny coincidence? Sure. I knew somebody on your plane. Really? Her name was Ana Lucia Cortez. She was my partner before I made detective-- Dark hair... Gorgeous. Maybe you knew her. Maybe you met her on the plane... Before it took off? Sorry. never met her. Why don't you watch the tape? Maybe it'll spark something. I'm gonna get a doughnut. You want one? No, thanks. And when I come back, you're gonna tell me who you ran from. Help! Help! Help! let me out! What the hell is wrong with you? What are you doing, Reyes? Huh? you trying to get tossed into the nuthouse? Because if that's what you want, I can make that happen right now, my friend. you can? Oh, thank you! Thank you. thank you. Jack? you there, dude? Beach to Jack. Right here, Hurley. what's up? Hey, uh, did you guys make it to that radio tower thingy yet? Yeah, and I talked to the people on the boat. They're on their way to pick us up right now. seriously? it worked? Seriously. we're all on the way back to the beach right now, So you better pack your bags, buddy. Dude, that's great! Any luck? Nothing. no sign of him. It's like he just disappeared. Why would Locke kill her? he hadn't even met her-- because he's crazy. So what if he comes back? If he comes back, I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna get everybody together. The sooner we get back to the beach, the better. Are we really going home? Yeah, we're really going home. I can't believe I'm actually going to have my baby In a hospital. Oh, rub it in, why don't you? oh, no. You ladies need a hand? no, we're just wrapping things up, thanks. You know, you must be very proud of Bernard. I hear he's quite the hero. Look, everyone up here knows That the real hero is your man, claire. If Charlie didn't turn off that gizmo, we'd still be Getting a busy signal on that fancy phone. So you better make sure you treat him real good When we get back. Rose! Okay, thanks. I have enough. I need you to do me a favor. I need you to take Alex And get as far from here as possible. What? listen to me. we don't have time for this. Everyone who stays here is going to die. Now get Alex and get away right now. I don't care where you go. just go. I will not have my daughter-- She's not your daughter. Did I ever tell you I won the lottery? I got, like, $150 million. Worst thing that ever happened to me. Oh, yeah, who needs $150 million, right? Now it'll all be gone, cause they all think I'm dead. When we get rescued, And I go back... I'm gonna be free. I wanna do a cannonball. I've been walking up and down this beach every day And looking out at this water, And I wanna do a cannonball. Hurley... You wanna do a cannonball, Cannonball. Are you all right, Desmond? We need to get to Jack. We can't let him get in touch with that boat. Easy, Scotty. everything's cool. boat's on the way. what? on the way? no. Hey, where's Charlie? no, that woman--Naomi-- she lied. Look, the people on the boat aren't who they say they are! what? Then who are they? Desmond, where's Charlie? Desmond-- I don't know, but we need to get in touch with Jack now! It's all right. we can call him. we have a walkie. it's okay. well, where is it? get it. What do you mean the people aren't who they say-- where's Charlie?! I'm--i'm--i'm sorry, brother. i... You think that's our ride? Hello? Hey, Jack. this is George Minkowski. We're trying to get a lock on your signal there, But we're getting some rf interference. We're gonna need to rejigger some of the settings On your sat-phone. Uh, sure. okay. just tell me what I gotta do. How about you put Naomi on? Naomi went to get some firewood. Can you hold on for a second? let me see if I can... Where is she? I don't know. Look, we gotta call the doc. Did you listen to Desmond? Charlie wrote on his hand-- Look, I'm sorry he's dead, but I don't even know What the hell "not Penny's boat" means. calling Jack accomplishes nothing. It would accomplish warning him. it also means warning the people on the freighter That we're suspicious of them. I have no doubt they're Monitoring our communications. if we call Jack-- you know what? I got the walkie. I'm making the call. hey! We better get goin'. Going where?! I found blood--the girl's trail. probably crawled away. Can't be more than ten minutes ahead of us. We should go now and find her. we're taking him with us. And why would we do that? Because I don't trust him with anybody but me. All right, listen up. I need all of you to head back down to the beach, And when these people show up, we wanna make sure That we're real easy for them to find, okay? You look worried, Jack. The only thing I'm worried about Is missing our ride home. I found her trail. she's headed west across the island. Rousseau already found it. we're going after her right now. What? are you sure it's hers? Unless someone else is bleeding. Okay, but if she didn't want us to find her, Then she could've created a dummy trail. I think we should follow both just in c-- Kate, six hours from now, We're gonna be sitting Laughing about the fact that there was one final thing That we couldn't agree upon. Naomi is hurt. she ran into the jungle. She's not thinking about leaving fake trails. You're right. I'll track her down. Why don't you get everybody back to the beach? you got it. Be careful, okay? What the hell's gotten into you, Hugo? They'll all be back in the morning. if we just wait-- You don't wait with warnings. you... warn. Here I was thinking I was gonna get a good night's sleep. You almost got me that time. How about best out of seven? Are you ready for your meds, Hugo? Oh, by the way, You have a visitor. Mr. Reyes. Hello. my name is Matthew Abbadon. I'm an attorney for oceanic airlines. Can we talk for a few minutes? Okay. I'm here, mr. Reyes, Because we've heard about your recent... episode. Your arrest, your incarceration here-- Frankly, we feel terrible about it. So on behalf of oceanic, I'd like to extend you an invitation For a little upgrade. What... kind of upgrade? To a facility where the paint isn't peeling off the walls, Where you'd have your own bathroom. You can see the ocean from-- I don't wanna see the ocean. No problem. Actually, thanks. I'm... I'm fine right here. Are you fine, mr. Reyes? What do you mean? You're in a mental institution. Who'd you say you were again? I'd like to see a business card. I must have left them at home. Then we're done, dude. Are they still alive? What? You heard me. Nurse! nurse! get out of here! You better get outta here! help me! help me! He's after me. easy. No, no, no, no. that guy's after me! help me! okay, okay. You all right there, Hugo? Yeah, dude, I'm fine. You wanna talk about it? Talk about what? Charlie. I mean... You two were buddies. I just thought... We'll probably get to Jack faster if we don't talk. I'm gonna head up and tell them to slow down a little. I can keep up. All right, ese. Just... holler if you need me. Guys? Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys! The blood trail ends here. What do you mean? It ends. What, are you telling me that she stopped bleeding here? No, I'm telling you that she fooled us and doubled back. Better call the boat, Tell 'em she's getting a really big bundle of firewood. Where is it? Okay, I probably should have told you That I saw her take the phone, but you beat me up, Jack. I owed you one. what are you talking about? Kate took it when she hugged you. She found the right trail, too, but you wouldn't listen to her, So I guess she's taken matters into her own hands. But look on the bright side. at least Somebody around here knows what the hell they're doing. Hello? Who's this? Uh, this is Kate. You with Jack? No, no, he's not here. where's Naomi? Uh, we're looking for her. What do you mean, you're looking for her? Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Naomi, listen to me. you're hurt. let me help you. Help me? I just spent the last three days Trying to get you people rescued, And you throw this knife in my back. No, that was not us. Who? His name is John Locke. what? He said that you weren't who you said you were. I swear to god we would never hurt you. you know us. Please, we need your help. please help us. Give me the phone. George, it's Naomi. Naomi, where have you been? What's going on over there? I had an accident. I'm hurt. What? a-an accident? what--what--what accident? What happened? Naomi! Hello? Hello? I hit a tree branch When I parachuted in. Took it through my gut. Why did they tell me you were getting firewood? I guess they were afraid to tell you what happened to me Till I could talk to you myself. we've lost our signal, and we can't come get you. Can you change your tracking frequency? Yeah. Try it now. Clear as a bell. hang on, Naomi. We'll--we'll get you back here asap, okay? I'm sorry, George. Just tell my sister that I love her. Hello? Help! Help! Help! There's nothing here. There's nothing here. there's nothing here. There's nothing here. Hello, Hugo. You got yourself good and lost out here, Hugo. How did you get separated from the group? I just... Fell behind, I guess. Is that why you were shouting for help? Well, I got scared. What Desmond said happened down in that station-- "not Penny's boat"... Are you sure that's what Charlie wrote on his hand? Jack should never have called those people. I couldn't agree more. It's gonna be hard to... Talk him into thinking they're not coming here To rescue us. Well, we're just gonna have to try our best, Hugo, Because if we Can't talk him out of it... Then Charlie died for nothing. Where the hell you been, Hugo? Sorry. I was just, uh, I got lost. What are you doing here? I came here for the same reason you did--to warn Jack About the people on that boat. I already gave it a shot, But I figured I might have better luck with some support. You want my support? You can tell me why you destroyed that submarine. Jin-Soo Kwon Still in one piece. Rambo. ow. I'll tell her. He's dead. Charlie's... dead. No. I'd watch out if I were you. What are you talking about, dude? There's a guy over there. he's staring at you. What guy? that guy. Hey, man. Don't run. Hurley. Just... Just... sit down. I wanna talk to you. Come on. don't do what you did in the store. Okay? There's no need to... freak out. No need to freak out? I'm trying to buy some jerky and a slushee, And suddenly you're standing there over by the ho hos. You're dead. what do you expect me to do? Can we just... sit down? I may be in a mental hospital, but I know you're dead, And I'm not having an imaginary conversation with you. I am dead. But I'm also here. Okay, prove it. Okay. okay. Did you know you were going to die When you swam out there? Why didn't you tell me? Because you would have tried to stop me. And since I was gonna do it anyway, I thought I would spare you all the drama. And now you have to do something. But you're hiding from it. That's the real reason you ran When you saw me in the store. You knew I was here to tell you-- No, I'm not listening to this. No, cause you're not here. I am here. you're being a baby. I'm gonna close my eyes and count to five, And when I open 'em, you'll be gone. I am here. One... don't do this. Two... they need you. Three... they need you, Hugo. Four! you know they need you. Five! What... what happened? I mean, how-- how did he... He was trying to help us. Jack. You're not gonna shoot me, Jack... Any more than I was gonna shoot... It's not loaded. Let's do it! Do you know what he did? yes, I know what he did! All I did... All I have ever done... Has been in the best interest of all of us. Are you insane?! I know i... I have a lot of explaining to do. But I never did anything to hurt any of you. I even risked my life to tell you that there was A traitor in your midst. she helped us, John. All you ever did was blow up every chance we had Of getting off this island. you killed Naomi! Well, technically, he didn't kill her yet. Yes, he did. She just died. She didn't give you up, John. She covered for us, And she fixed this. they're on their way. She didn't cover for anyone. She wants her people to come here. And trust me, when they do, We had better be far away from here. I'm going to the barracks. the others abandoned them. It's the only place on the island with any form Of security right now. it'll have to do Until I can think of something else. Until then, if you want to live, you need to come with me. No one's going anywhere with you, John, Because they're not crazy. he's not crazy. What about Charlie? Charlie went down to that place so we could all be rescued. And whatever he did down there... It worked. But then something must've happened. He must have heard something before he... I don't know why, But it changed his mind. Because the last thing he did Was to warn us That the people on that boat are not who they said they were. So I'm not listening to you. I'm listening to my friend. I'm listening to Charlie. Anyone else? There isn't much time. Jack, with your permission, I'd like to go with John. He's all yours. You said we'd never leave the island. If you, uh, You wanna go with Locke, I'll be right behind ya. I'm not going anywhere with that man. What are you doing? Same thing I've always done, Kate... Survivin'. You know where to find us when you change your mind. You ever miss? Jack. Yeah. I was, uh, on my way back from a consult. Thought I'd drop by and pay you a visit. Horse? You're on. So... consult, huh? Does that mean you're back doing surgical stuff? Yeah. "h." Reporters leaving you alone? Yeah. still have to sign some autographs When I go out for coffee, but... Thinking about growing a beard. You'd look weird with a beard, dude. That's h-o. So... What are you really doing here, Jack? I was just checking on you, Seeing if everything was okay. You're checking to see if I went nuts, If I was gonna tell. Are you? You're up. Nah, you win. i, uh... I gotta run. It was great seeing you, Hurley. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I went with Locke. I should've stayed with you. It's water under the bridge, man. I don't think we did the right thing, Jack. I think it wants us to come back. Hurley... And it's gonna do everything it can-- we're never going back. Never say never, dude. Are you thinking of Charlie? Feels like a hundred years ago that we came out here together. How did this happen? Thunder's getting louder. That's not thunder.
