I'll be right back. She's not breathing. Watch out. Come with me. Don't worry. She will be fine. Good. Let it out. You okay? Where's my mom? I don't know. She's meeting us in Los Angeles. Pam! Pam! Has anybody seen my wife? Pam! We're not there yet... But I promise we're gonna get you home soon, okay? Excuse me. Would you look after the children? There's something I have to do. Uh, okay. Stay with this nice woman. I'll be back in a minute. Oh, my leg! My leg! Oh! Is it bad? Oh. It's bad, isn't it? No. It's not that bad. I broke my leg skiing up at Stowe, in Vermont. I was on this run going pretty fast. I was racing this cute ski patrol guy. I went off this mogul, lost my edge, and... - Bam! - Aah! Snapped my left leg. Now that... that was bad. You a doctor? A year of med school before I dropped out. I'm a clinical psychologist. You saved that girl's life. Are you a doctor? No. Help! Hey! I need some help! There's somebody in the jungle! He's alive! Help! Help me! Please help me! Help! Help! We should climb up there. I'll hold him steady, you pull him-- No, no, wait. What's your name? Uh... uh, uh, Bernard! You're gonna be all right, Bernard. I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you. Is he dead? I think he's dead! Maybe we should climb up there... No! I need you to focus, Bernard. Unbuckle your seat belt. Now grab the branch next to you. I don't think I can do that. Bernard, those seats are gonna fall. Come on, you can do it. Bernard! All right. Hold on tight, okay? I'm coming up to get ya. Does anybody have any water? No, not here. Couldn't find any matches? Dry ones? You can ask around, but I couldn't find any. It's gonna be dark soon. Gonna get a signal fire started so they can find us. - What are you, a boy scout? - A grown-up version. I'm in the peace corps. They still have that? I'm just happy somebody your age actually knows what it is. What's your name? Goodwin. I'm Ana Lucia. I heard that... you were the one who... pulled the dead bodies out of the water. Yes. Were any of them african-american? No. It's my wife... I can't find her. I will pray for her. Where the hell are the rescue planes? I will pray for them, too. Yeah. What was that? Libby... watch the kids. Over here. It's all right. We'll be okay. What happened? No wallet. No cell phone. No keys, nothing. Hey. Are you okay? Hey! Look, three of the people are missing-- the blond guy, the curly-haired guy and the german who was helping us with the injured. - Did you see anything? - No, I didn't. Where they came from, how many there were? No, I didn't see anything. Who are these people? I don't know, but they're out here in the jungle with no shoes, nothing in their pockets, no labels on their clothes. These people were here before us. We need to get off the beach. We need to find a safer place. We've got kids and people who are seriously hurt. Where are we going to go, hmm? How are we going to move them? And what about the signal fire? How are we all going to get rescued if we're off the beach? Nathan's right. They have satellites, the black box. We don't need a fire for them to find us. Yes, we do. Before the crash, the pilot said we'd lost communication. We were turning back. We were flying for two hours in the wrong direction. They don't know where to look. It's Donald. His leg-- the infection is getting worse. He'll be the fourth to go. What are we supposed to do about that? Now come here. Come on, grab it, grab it! Over here! Come on! Over here! I got it, I got it, got it. No, I got it, I got it. All right. I've got it, I got it. Would you like some chicken? You haven't said a word in a week. Why aren't you talking? Hey. It wasn't your fault, you know. You were just defending yourself. - That'll work. - Yeah. I heard a pig or something out there. Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow. What? Where were you? I had to go to the bathroom. We have a system for that. We go in pairs. Yeah, sorry. Help! The kids! They took the kids! They took Jed and Eli! Nancy's gone. They're gone. Which way did they go? Which way did they go?! Wake up, wake up! Who are you? Talk to me! She's dead. She's dead. What are you doing? Is that a knife? What is that? It's a list. A list of what? Nine... of us. Nothing? They dragged nine people into the jungle, the kids, and there's no sign of 'em? Now's not a good time to talk? What needs to happen to make you say something?! Hey, calm down. Let's figure this out. "Calm down"? "Let's figure this out"? Here are the names of every single person they took-- all nine of them, what they were wearing, what they look like. One of them had a list of us. They could have gotten our names from the people they already took. Nobody knew anybody's names the first night. Maybe they're watching us. You were gone for two hours yesterday. What? - Where were you? - I was going to the bathroom. Hey, stop! We're all scared. Let's not get paranoid here. We don't know anything. He's right. Why would they try to infiltrate us? I mean, that's crazy. Well, whoever they are, they know we are here. We need to leave this beach. You said we needed to keepthe signal fire burning. I think it's time we let it go out. Five minutes. Ah, we've been walking for three days straight, Ana. And you're still here. Five minutes. You know what? Y'all want to keep walking, go ahead. Fresh water, rock wall at our backs, lots of fruit trees. Right here looks pretty goodto me. Fine, okay. This will work. Hey. Hey. Back at the beach, the night they came back, you said that Nathan was gone for two hours, that he was missing. He creeps me out, Ana. You really think it's possible that one of us... is one of them? Why do you think I'm digging this hole? Are we really going to be able to catch rabbits with this? Oh, yeah. Give me another stick. Oh, hey, Ana. Ana! what are you doing? You and I are going to have a little talk, Nathan. You let me out of here right now! You let me out! You let me out, or I'll... I didn't do anything, Ana! - He wasn't on the plane. - What? We were in the air for two hours. I didn't see him once, not once. It's a big plane, Ana. Just because you didn't-- No, I didn't see him either. And I'm pretty good with faces of the passengers, and I did not see him. Wait, you're not all serious. He never talks about himself-- Nathan. Every time I ask him anything, he just dodges. No. If he really were one of them, why would he still be here? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Will you let me out?! Ana! You got a problem with this? I didn't do anything! Let me out! Where are the kids? Where are the kids? Where are you from, Nathan? Canada. What were you doing in Australia? Company retreat. - Where are they? - What? They rest of your retreat. Where are they? They weren't on the plane. I stayed a couple extra days to sightsee. How come nobody saw you on the plane, Nathan? - I was in the lavatory. - For two hours? I don't remember seeing you on the plane, Ana Lucia. That's because you weren't on it. Where are the kids, Nathan? Where are the kids? You're not talking to me anymore? What's that behind you? Get up! I said, "get up"! - Who gave him food? - What happened? I'm trying to find out what they did to us, and you're taking care of him. I didn't do anything. And what if you're wrong, Ana? We don't even know that there is a spy. Whose idea was it to stay at the beach where they could pick us off one by one? His, Nathan's. Well, they haven't come since you put him in there. Who did it? You? We're worried about you, Ana. You've had him down there four days. I promised that little girl that I would get her back home to her mom. You have any kids, Ana? No. We should let him go. We're not savages. If I were a savage, I would have cut off his finger already. That's tomorrow. Grab the rope! I'll pull you up! Ana Lucia is, uh... I think we all think that she's gonna hurt you. Now you need to get away from here. There's some fruit in there. Now just go. Which way's the beach? That way, maybe 5 miles. Morning. Morning. Ana Lucia! - He's gone. - What? He's gone. Nathan's gone. Ana, what are you gonna do? They found us. It's time to move. What is it? I don't know. Some sort of bunker. Do you think it's theirs? What are you doing? What is this place? Looks like some sort of storage facility. Hey, come over here. What was that? Get it. What else is in here? It's a glass eye. Look at this. It's a radio. Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me? The hills are blocking it. If we want a signal, we need to get to higher ground. I'll do it. I'll go with you. Nah, you should stay here, Ana, get this place set up as a shelter. We can all get it set up. We can make it back in a couple of hours. Let's go. Why do you think they're doing this? Why do I think who's doing what? Them. Don't you ever wonder why they attack us? Maybe they're not attacking us. Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then. No real harm done. Good point. Why do you think they take some of us and not the others? You know, that first night they took the strongest of us, your quiet friend, three other guys. They're all athletic, tough... threats. They didn't take you. I guess they changed their plan after two of 'em got killed. You want to take a break? Yeah, that's a good idea. Can I have the knife? Thank you. Where do you think they got it? I mean, they don't even wear shoes. How'd they get an army knife? Sorry? That knife, it's U.S. Military. Here. I'll show you. You see the tang stamp? This knife's probably 20 years old. You don't see these anymore, yet here it is on this island. Weird, huh? Can I ask you something? Sure, Ana. When you ran out of the jungle the day of the crash, how did you... how did you find Bernard up in the tree? I heard him shouting from the beach. From the beach? Why are you asking me about that, Ana? Did he see you out there? Is that why you pretended to be one of us? You ran out of the jungle ten minutes after the crash. You weren't wet. You were never even in the ocean. Where are they? Your friends. Nathan. What did you-- If you had cut off his finger, and he still told you he was on the plane, I think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy. Did you kill him? Nathan was not a good person. That's why he wasn't on the list. What about the kids? Did you kill them, too? The children are fine. They're better off now. Where's Goodwin? We're safe here now. Why are you wasting your time with that thing? There's no signal. I only turn it on a couple minutes a day. - It really doesn't-- - Hello. Hello? Is anybody out there? Mayday, mayday! - Is there someone there? - Hello?! Hello?! - Who is that? - Can you hear me? Repeat your transmission, please. Hello! We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815. Please copy. We're the survivors of flight 815. No, wait a minute. What are you doing? It's them. It's them. They're trying to draw us out. They're trying to find us. No, he said "815." He said, "flight 815." They know our flight number because Goodwin knew our flight number. But what if there really are survivors out there? There are no survivors. This is our life now. Get used to it. What are you looking at? It's going to be okay. What, you're talking now? It's been 40 days. You've been waiting 40 days to talk? You waited 40 days to cry. Libby. Turn him over. Is he alive? Get Ana Lucia, quick! Who are you? Where are you from? - He doesn't even speak English. - That doesn't mean anything. Ana, we found him in the water. He has a broken handcuff on his wrist. I'm not sure that he's a threat. He's running! - Michael, Sawyer! - Jin! Others, others, others, others, others! Others. - Hit me. - Hit you? You think they're okay? Let's find out. Hit me. - Cindy. Where's Cindy? - Did they take her? Cindy!
