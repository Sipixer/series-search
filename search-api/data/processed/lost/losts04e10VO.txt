Yeah. yeah, I remember, jane. I'll, um... I'll be in there. Thank you, doctor. all right. bye. Ow. son of a bitch. A-rod. Morning. Morning yourself. I bought you a razor. What, you don't like the scruff? Razor's by the sink, jack. Morning. "alice took up the fan, and as the hall was very hot, "she kept fanning herself "all the time she went on talking, "'dear, dear. how queer everything is today. "'and yesterday, things went on just as usual. "'i wonder if I've been changed in the night. Let me think. was I the same when I got up this morning? '" "'but if I'm not the same, the next question is, "who in the world am i? ' Aha, that's the great puzzle. " You're a natural. Yeah? Yeah. My old man used to read me that story. Really? What? It's just... It's just sweet hearing you say nice things about your dad. I don't say nice things about my dad? Well, he was a good storyteller. I'll give him that. You okay? Yeah. Just, i... I love seeing you with him. I'm so glad you changed your mind. I'm so glad that you're here. Me, too. Keep him in the shade. I'll get him some water. Give--give him some air, guys. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good. Hey, what happened? he passed out. You fainted? I'm fine. I'm just, uh... just a little dehydrated. No, jack. you're not okay. you're burning up. I'm fine. I'm fine. I just... Just need to get a little rest. jack-- I'm fine. You okay? yeah, just a bit woozy. How's your head? It's better. bit of a headache, But at least I'm not seeing things anymore. Yeah? what'd you see? Back off, donger. I'm just making conversation. let's make some time. I wanna cover more ground before we gotta camp tonight. If we hoof it, we can make it to the beach by noon tomorrow. No! What? Who's danielle and karl? Y-you mean rousseau? the french woman? Oh, my god. Is this your french woman? Karl Karl. How'd you know they were down there? Your buddies do this? They're not my buddies, man. I didn't sign up for this. Can we just--can we just get out of here, please? can we just go? Yeah, yeah, of course. but don't worry. Once we get back to the beach, everything's gonna be fine. All right? Come on. Let's go. I hate being sick. What do you think it is? It's food poisoning. What makes you think that? I've got some cramping, dehydrated, nausea. I respectfully disagree. Do you? You want to lift your shirt up? If it's food poisoning, you got nothing to worry about. It's your appendix, jack. When did the pain start? Yesterday. Has it ruptured? Not yet. Well... I guess we're just gonna have to take it out. Do you remember where the medical station is? -Or don't you? -Yes, I remember. These are the instruments that I need you to bring back. -You'll find them in the drawers in the exam room. -"clamps"? sutures"? Juliet, I don't know what these look like. I can help you. I'm familiar with surgical instruments. I thought you were a physicist. Yeah, well, I've done some animal autopsies, too, so if--if-- no. We can't trust them. -See, Dan? I told you. They're convinced we're trying to kill 'em. -Might as well keep playing the part. -Damn it, charlotte. That right there, that right there. Your--your attitude-- your very bad attitude-- It's exactly why they don't trust us. Come on. Juliet, please. Don't blame us for--for this, for whatever is happening. We're scientists. We don't want anyone to get hurt. We just wanna help. Please let us help. Either of them tries to run? Shoot 'em in the leg. Get back here as fast as you can. Okay. Thank you. We need to create a sterile environment. Find a hard surface, wash it down, Gather as many tarps as you can. Hey, juliet. If everything that we need is at the medical station, -Then why don't we just bring jack there? -Because if we move him, There's a good chance that his appendix will rupture. And if that happens, he's gonna die. Don't even think about it. What? Don't look at her. Don't talk to her. Don't mess with her. You got a restraining order. 20 feet. What are you, her big brother? No. I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot in your face Unless you say, "yeah. I getcha. " Yeah. I getcha. Honey, I am sure Jack is gonna be okay. An appendectomy Is just about the most common kind of surgery there is. That's not what I was thinking about. I was thinking, "why did he get sick? " Why? It's just-- it's just bad luck. The day before we're all supposed to be rescued, The person that we count on the most Suddenly comes down with a life-threatening condition, -And you're chalking it up to bad luck? -Well, what are you saying, That--that Jack did something to offend the gods? People get sick, Rose. -Not here. Here, they get better. When was the last time you did this? An appendectomy or shaving a man's stomach? In my residency. I did a lot of 'em back then. Then you know the incision needs to be 2 inches lower than where you're shaving. I'm just cleaning the area. Thank you. I wanna talk you through it. What? I don't want to be unconscious. We can use the lidocaine To numb the area. And then I can watch the procedure, Help you out. And, uh, how are you gonna watch Flat on your back with my hand in your abdominal cavity? We can use a mirror. kate can hold it. If someone's going to be in there, Shouldn't it be someone with medical experience? -Bernard's a dentist-- -No, I want it to be kate. Okay. Don't worry, Ms. berenberg. You're in good hands. Thank you. -I'll see you tomorrow at 5:00 a. M. ? -Mm-hmm. And remember, no solid food. okay? -Thank you, doctor. -Have a good evening. Jack? Jack? Jack? Jack? Will you take a look at this x-ray? -Uh, it's in the L4. I wanna know what you think. -The L4. yeah. yeah. Oh, Dr. Shephard, there's a call for you. It's a dr. stillman from Santa rosa hospital, Says it's about a friend of yours. He's refusing to take his meds, And he's stopped sleeping. What about his therapy sessions? Therapy's... been rendered useless. And why is that? Because he doesn't think I exist. Hey, hurley. Hey, jack. Why aren't you taking your meds? Cause we're dead... All of us. All the oceanic six-- we're all dead. We never got off that island. Hurley Hurley... That is not true. What'd you do today? What did I do today? I, uh... I woke up, took a shower. Uh, kate and I fed the baby. I thought you didn't want anything to do with aaron. I changed my mind after the trial. Living with kate... Taking care of aaron... It all seems so perfect... Just like heaven. Just because I'm happy Doesn't mean that this isn't real, hurley. I was happy, too, jack... For a while, anyway. Then I saw charlie. He likes to sit with me on the bench Out on the front lawn. It's pretty cool, actually. Okay. so what do the two of you talk about? Well, yesterday, he told me you were gonna be coming by. He wanted me to give you a message. A message? He made me write it down so I wouldn't mess it up. "you're not supposed to raise him, jack. " Does that make any sense? No, that... doesn't make any sense. Do you think he means aaron? Take your meds, hurley. Just take 'em. Hey, jack? Charlie said someone's gonna be visiting you, too. Soon. We're here. Why don't you let me go first? Um, you know, make sure everything's safe. Okay. Be careful, dan. Absolutely. Do you think she knows he likes her? She's a woman. She knows. Jin. Come on. Where do you suppose all this power's coming from? Add that one to the list, dan. Let's just grab the equipment and go, shall we? Are you all right? This is where Juliet brought me. This is where I saw our baby. They're not going to help us, Jin. Don't worry about them. I promise you Sun. I will get you and our baby off this island. Whoa! hey, you want a hand with the baby? Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine. You sure? I'm good with kids. what part of "restraining order" Don't you understand? Get behind me, claire. Who the hell are you? -Lapidus? -Miles? Lapidus? miles?

You wanna help me out? um, I don't... I don't think that's a good idea. It's just holding a mirror. Jack wants to watch the surgery, "talk me through it. " What? I'm just surprised He's not taking it out of himself by now. Jack Jack. What are you doin'? I don't need a stretcher. I can walk 50 feet. I'll help you. They're gonna be back with the instruments soon. We need to be ready to go as soon as they get back. See you in there. So it looks like I'm gonna be your nurse. Wouldn't be the first time. Listen, um... If something happens to me-- shut up, Jack. Fair enough. Kate? Kate? Kate? Kate? Wake up, Kate. What time is it? It's late. I just got home. Were you working? No. i...
