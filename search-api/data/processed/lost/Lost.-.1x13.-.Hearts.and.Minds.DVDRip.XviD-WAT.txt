on the path to the beach. - Charlie? - He went after Claire. Footprints, three distinct sets all over the place. Looks like there might have been a struggle. l think they've been taken. We need to organize a search party. Can l help? Could use a hand, if you're up for it. This is a deserted island. How are you gonna find them? - What do you do in the real world? - l was a... ...regional collections supervisor for a box company. Yeah, right. - You should head back. - What about you? - l can take care of myself. - No. - l admire your courage, but you... - l'm not heading back. - Where have you been? - What do you mean? You and Locke leaving before sunrise and coming back after dark for four days. What are you doing out there? - Looking for Claire. - l thought there was no trail, no one knew where to look. lt's gonna start raining in one minute. - One minute? - Give or take a few seconds. [Shannon] They aren't back yet. l'm sure they just made camp for the night. lf there's anyone on this island your brother's safe with, it's Locke. They teach you how to predict the weather at a box company? l brought you a present for helping me with the translations. l didn't have a chance to get it gift wrapped, so... Oh... l found these in the wreckage, and l have no use for them personally. They're actually my size. Well, half a size off, but l swear, this place is making my feet swell. Another mysterious force on the island revealed. [Hurley] Yo, Boone. - Question for you, dude. - Yeah. You and Locke are hunting boar every day, right? - What about it? - lt's cool, except how come you're not coming back with any? We haven't had fresh pork on our plate in about a week. lt's not like they're domesticated animals. - Maybe you aren't trying hard? - We're hunting. l hope so, 'cause people need food, man. Solid food. This isn't a game, man. [Shannon chattering] [cell phone ringing] l can't believe you ran down that last ball. - Then you hit it for a winner. - Lucky shot. Yeah, l wish it was luck. - [cell phone ringing] - ls that my phone? Yeah, hello. [Shannon] Boone, it's me. - Shannon? - <i>Yeah.</i> What's the matter? - <i>Things aren't so good.</i> - Where are you? Get out of here! Get the hell away from me! - Shannon? - <i>Stay out of here!</i> Get away from me! - What's going on? - <i>I can't talk.</i> All right, hang on. Just tell me where you are. l'll come get you. - <i>Sydney.</i> - Sydney. Australia. Stay away from my sister. For a moment, you seemed to be giving me an order. - lt's just a friendly suggestion. - A suggestion. Yes, and if l were you, l'd listen. What if l don't? [Locke] Boone! l found some fresh tracks down by the stream. - l'll see you later. - You know where to find me. [Locke] Put aside your differences with Sayid. [Boone] He's hitting on Shannon. [Locke] He's very competent. We don't want to make an enemy of him. We're gonna want him on our side. People are talking about what we're doing, since we never come back with anything. You mean boar. - Yeah. - There's plenty of fruit and fish. What we're doing here is far more important. Right now, this is our priority. So, Jack... So, Hurley. There's something kind of important l've been wanting to ask you about. Um... Anything l tell you is, uh, doctor-patient confidential, right? Yeah. The thing is, l haven't been feeling so great. What's the matter? Well, it's kinda like, uh, my stomach. l've been having some, um... ...major digestive issues. - What have you been eating? - The usual<i>:</i> Bananas, papayas, mangoes, guava, passion fruit, coconut, some of those weird star fruits from up on the hill. Someone said they'd be good for digestion. Let me tell you, they lied. lt might help if you had a little more protein. What can l do? There's no boar. No boar, no protein. You can eat fish. Jin's been catching a lot of 'em. - That guy has it in for me. - Come on... l'm not kidding. He offered me something to eat, like, right after we, you know, got here. - Um, that thing with the spikes. - Sea urchin. Yeah, when l turned him down, it's like l soiled his family honor or something. He hasn't looked me in the eye since. The guy holds a serious grudge. You're not eating those, are you? [stomach gurgling] Dude, these aren't for eating. Excuse me. - l can see you there, you know. - [chuckles] l wasn't hiding. l just didn't want to disrupt you from doing... ...whatever it is you're doing. - lt's not like it's a secret. - Hard to tell with you sometimes. Ah! Gross, little, grayish yellow things. - Passion fruit seeds. - What are they for? l'll show you... if you want to see. Yeah. Follow me. Please tell me you found a coffee bar. Not quite. [Jack chuckles] - When did you do all this? - l didn't. lt was all Sun. l wandered into this place the other day when l was picking fruit. This is beautiful. lt's great. She planted some herbs and some low-growing stuff here, and then she started a grove over there. Smart. With the boar running out, we're gonna need as much food as we can get. - Maybe it's not running out. - What do you mean? Maybe Locke's just decided not to catch it for us anymore. - Why would he do that? - A lot of mouths to feed. lf the boar's thinning out, why should he feed everyone else at his expense? [Boone] That glass isn't breaking, and the door is sealed shut. l think it's cement. - What is that? - [Locke] Hmm? The stuff in the bowl, what is that? lt's for later. Not to be too difficult, but we've been coming here for two days, just staring at this thing. l'm not really sure what we're supposed to be doing. Lodovico Buonarroti. Michelangelo's father, he was a wealthy man. Had no understanding of the divinity in his son, so he beat him. No child of his was gonna use his hands for a living. So Michelangelo learned not to use his hands. Years later, a visiting prince came into Michelangelo's studio and found the master staring at a single 1 8-foot block of marble. He knew the rumors were true, Michelangelo had come in every day for the past four months, stared at the marble and gone home for supper. So the prince asked the obvious<i>:</i> ''What are you doing?'' And Michelangelo turned around and looked at him and whispered... [speaking ltalian] ''l'm working.'' Three years later, that block of marble was the statue of David. We're not gonna stare at this thing for four months, are we? How we gonna open it? That's what we have to figure out. That's why we're sitting here. l mean, how do you open a... ...hatch that has no handle, no latch... ...no discernible way of opening it? [knocking] Yeah? - l'm looking for Shannon. - Who are you? l'm her brother. - Boone? - What's going on? What are you doing here? Fifteen hours. l just spent 1 5 hours on a plane. ''l'm happy to see you.'' That might work. Listen, this isn't really the best time. Bryan and l were on our way out to meet some friends. Give me a call tomorrow. Please. Okay. Enjoy your friends. [Hurley] Jin! Yo, Jin! Uh, <i>alto.</i> l know you don't like me 'cause of the sea urchin thing. That's okay, 'cause l'm not asking for any favors. Just let me know where you get the fish. Fish. Point me in the right direction. l'll take care of my own business with my own tools. [speaking Korean] You just said something mean, didn't you? You know, we're gonna have to tell 'em. - Tell them what? - What we found. They're not gonna keep believing that we're hunting. They're not ready. They won't understand it. - l don't think l understand it. - That's the problem. Look, at least... l gotta tell Shannon. - Why? - 'Cause she's my sister. Why do you care about her so much? You don't know her, man. She's smart and she's special in a lot of ways. Fair enough. She's been asking me about this. l can't keep lying to her. You can't keep lying to her, or you can't stand the way she makes you feel because you're lying to her? Both. Whatever. Look, she can keep a secret. - You're sure? - Yes, l'm sure. l mean, are you sure you want to do this? l gotta get her off my back. She keeps asking me about this, about you, about the whole thing. Are you sure you've thought through the ramifications? Yes. So be it. Locke... What is this? Do you hear me? - Untie me right now. - Or what? l swear l won't tell anyone about the hatch thing, okay? l promise. l'm doing this because it's time for you to let go of some things, because it's what's best for you. And l promise, you're gonna thank me for this later. Hey, l don't think this is best for me. What is that? An untreated wound out here, it's gonna get infected. You're not gonna leave me here. Whether you stay is up to you. The camp is four miles due west. Which way is west? You'll be able to cut yourself free once you have the proper motivation. Locke! [straining] [shrieks] Help! Help! l'm sorry, Mr. Carlisle, but l'm afraid l can't help you. We'll need a little more to go on. l don't understand this. l'm reporting a crime. Look, this is a cycle with her, okay? My sister is attracted to the wrong kind of guy. lt was his bottle. l just gave it back to him. Hey, yo, croc hunter! How come nobody wants to hear my side of the story? Now, if that were her mate, see, then l could help you. Let's finish taking down your information. You were saying she's your sister. Then why is her name Rutherford and yours Carlisle? - ls she married? - She was. She's not married anymore. That has nothing to do with this. Rutherford is her father's name. Our parents married when l was 1 0, she was 8. - She's your stepsister. - That's right. No blood relation. Maybe you've heard of my mother, Sabrina Carlisle. She owns the largest wedding business in the U.S. l'm the C.O.O. of the wedding clothing subsidiary. Would you like to buy my wife's wedding dress? lt cost $2,000 new. lt's only been worn once. l just want someone to go pay this guy a visit, that's all. ln the absence of physical evidence or a direct complaint from... - Shannon. - ...Shannon... We can't barge into people's apartments. Sadly, we're the police, not the dating police. - Bryan, we need to talk. - Huh? l'm not gonna waste your time or mine. l want you to break up with my sister. - What? - l want you to end it today. Right now. - Bugger off, mate. - You don't understand. You'll be the third guy l've paid to leave. Go to her house, pack your stuff and never have contact with her again. - Understood? - So you flew over here to bribe me? l'm going to give you 25,000 U.S. dollars. - l love her. - How much? My love for her? lt's worth closer to $50,000. Can you believe we've been here for over three weeks? l was on my way to Bali. l travel a lot. l was looking forward to exploring the island. Somehow l ended up on a flight to LA instead. l guess that falls under the category ''Be careful what you wish for.'' You understood me. You did, didn't you? You just understood what l said. You speak English? Please, don't tell anyone. Damn it! [speaking Korean] You know what? Fine. You win, okay? You happy now? Keep your damn fish. l'm outta here. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! l stepped on a friggin' urchin! You understand me? You understand infection? Gangrene? Amputation? Ow! My foot! - [Jin speaks Korean] - [Hurley groans] Oh. Ow! Oh, you gotta do something for me. [speaking Korean] You're gonna have to pee on my foot. lt'll stop the venom. l saw it on TV. Just do it! Ow! No, just pee on it, man! You need to pee... Pee on it. Pee on my foot. l'll lose... l'll lose my foot if you don't. Just pee on it! No! [rustling] - Hi. - l didn't hear you. Sorry. l'm sneakier than l give myself credit for. - What are you doing out here? - We were hunting. Boone thought l should take the afternoon off. Boone is hunting? Boy's eager to learn. - You think he'll catch anything? - Nope. What are you doing out here, Sayid? Orienteering. l'm trying to make something of Rousseau's maps... There's nothing to make. Exactly. Well, you made a compass. l haven't seen one of those since l was a Webelos. What's a Webelos? Hal<i>fw</i>ay between a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout. And what does a Webelos do? Gets badges mostly. Ties knots, identifies birds. l wasn't the most popular kid. l'll leave you to it. Here. Maybe this will help your cause. - Don't you need this? - Not anymore. [woman] Somebody, help me! - Who's that? - Boone? Shannon! - l'm tied up! - What? Can you get over here? l'm tied up too! [birds' wings fluttering] [roaring] [crashing] - [Shannon screams] - Hold on. l'm coming! [Shannon] Boone! lt's getting closer! Somebody, help me! [crashing grows louder] Boone? [grunting] [yelling] [growling] Please, Boone! [yelling] Oh! [gasping] - [roaring] - [crashing] Boone! [roaring] - Boone! - Shannon! - Help me! Hurry! - l'm trying. Please. Please hurry! Go! - [crashing] - [roaring] Come on! - Run! - No! ln here. [roaring] [growling] [birds screeching] - [loud crash] - [Shannon sobbing] No! Let me ask you something. Which way do you think north is? - Sorry? - North. Which way is it? Uh... [sighs] Okay. The sun's gonna set there, so that makes that west. That'd be north. Yeah. Correct. That's where north should be. Yet that is north. l'm not... A magnetic anomaly might explain a variance of two or three degrees, but not this. - What are you saying? - This compass is obviously defective. Where'd you get it? Locke gave it to me this afternoon. Locke. Where'd you see Locke? About a mile east of here, walking through the jungle. At least l think it's east. [panting] [Shannon] What did you do to him? - What did l do to who? - Locke. What did you do to piss him off? l didn't do anything to him. What, he just did it because he was bored? - Look, l know you guys are... - Let's go back to camp. [knocking] - You were supposed to come later. - Any bags? - Anything you want? - Come back. No, we're getting out of this country. ls there anything you want to bring with you? What's the matter? Oh, look at this. Let's go, please. Come on. We can go. Hey, mate, you don't get this yet, do you? What's what. You set me up. This whole thing was a setup. - She's getting what she's owed. - What did you say? She told me your mum screwed Shannon over after her daddy died, kept her father's money for herself. Oh, sweet mum you got there. This isn't the first time, is it? - You've done this before, little bitch. - That's enough. Don't touch me, you lowlife piece of... Bryan, get off of him! Get off of him! Get off! Any ships? Not yet. But l'm... patient. Mind if l join you? Been a while since you and l talked, John. - Well, you're a busy man. - So are you. Where's Boone? - l haven't seen him today. - Yeah? You two have been attached at the hip all week. Well, let me just check my hip. Nope, no Boone. How's the boar hunting going? - Between you and me? - Always. l'm afraid they're beginning to migrate outside our valley. They're smart animals, and smart animals adapt quickly when a new predator's introduced into their environment. You mean us? The most dangerous predator of all. Does anybody else know? Only Michael. - Not your husband? - Please... Don't worry. l can keep a secret. l took English lessons in Korea. He doesn't know. lt's... ...complicated. - So why don't you tell him now? - l can't. Why? Because l love him. - l don't... - Have you never lied to a man you've loved? You sure you don't speak English? 'Cause there's a rumor that you do. Your wife's hot. [speaking Korean] Oh, l get it. This is some kind of payback because l wouldn't eat the urchin the other time? l eat this, you give me a fish, right? Okay, fine. Over the lips, past the gums, yadda, yadda... Oh, God. [retching] Cheers. You need a hand? Yeah. l'd love one. l seen you around the caves lately. l needed a change of scenery. How are you doing, Charlie? How am l doing? With week two of heroin withdrawal, or with Claire being abducted by the freak who tried to kill me? l gave you the aspirin for the withdrawal. - What do you think his story is? - Who? Locke? The guy's a freak of nature. Highly disturbed. He probably killed all his mates the day his mom forgot to put a cookie in his lunch. That was my first impression, anyway. And then he saved my life. So you trust him? Trust him? lf there's one person on this island l would put my absolute faith in to save us all, it would be John Locke. [dog barking] Come on, boy. You want the ball? Go get the ball. Good boy. [Hurley] You found your bag? - That's awesome, man. - Yeah. Be nice to get to use your own toothbrush again. - Got some papaya there? - Yeah. - Yippee. - Hey, you mind if l, uh... Oh, knock yourself out. Want to wish something on your enemy? Hope they step on a sea urchin. Oh, hey. Thanks. Has this already been cleaned? Are you kidding? [speaking Korean] [Sun chuckles] [conversing in Korean] They look happy. Happy? Put out your hand. You'll like it, l swear. Gross, little, grayish yellow thingies? No, these are slimy, little, bluish black things. Guava seeds. What's a garden without guava? - Are we going the right direction? - lf you don't want to follow, don't. l wouldn't have to if you weren't best friends with that nutcase. You weren't hunting. You were doing something else. - Haven't we been over this? - You're a horrible liar. - We weren't doing anything. - Why are you keeping secrets? Do you know who ''this guy'' is? He's the only one here that has a clue to what's going on. - What is that supposed to mean? - lt means he's smart. He tied us up, Boone. Why? We found something. What? While looking for Claire, we found a piece of metal buried in the jungle. We've been excavating. That's what we've been doing. - A piece of metal. - A hatch buried in the dirt. - Like a door? - Yeah, that's what a hatch is. - Where does it go? - [birds' wings fluttering] l don't know. l told him l wanted to tell you. That's when he did this. [roaring] [Boone] Come on! [roaring continues] [crashing] - [loud screeching] - [Shannon screams] No! Shannon! Shannon! Shannon! [knocking] [knocking] What do you want? Bryan took the money. He's gone. So the player got played. That's poetic, don't you think? l knew you'd bring the money. - You are drunk. - Do you wanna know why? lt doesn't matter. You're going to tell me. Because you're in love with me. What? You brought the money because you're in love with me. You show up here plastered... - You've always been. - You've always been self-centered, but now you're delusional. l've always known it. You're sick. No... - [Boone] Stop. - lt's okay. Shannon... lt's okay. Boone. What? When we get back to LA, you should just tell your mom that... ...you rescued me again, just like you always do, and then we'll just go back. - To what? - To what it was. Like it's all up to you. Get dressed. Shannon! No. Shannon. Shannon. Shannon. Shannon? Oh, Shannon. lt killed her! - You made it back. - That thing killed my sister. lt's your fault. You drug her out there. - Your sister? - Don't play dumb. - Calm down. - She died in my arms. Why is there no blood on you? What just happened to me out there? l don't know. l don't know. You tell me. - But your sister, Shannon... - [Shannon] l could spend days... - [Shannon chuckles] - [Sayid] Sorry to spoil it. [chattering] She... She was dead. - ls that what it made you see? - What made me see? That stuff you put on my head. - You drugged me? - l gave you an experience that l believed was vital to your survival on this island. lt wasn't real? lt was only as real as you made it. l saw her. l saw her die. How did you feel when she died? l felt... l felt... l felt relieved. l felt relieved. Yes. Time to let go.
