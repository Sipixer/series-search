- l need to talk to you. - You speak English? My husband doesn't know. He has a bad temper. l need your help. Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? [Sawyer] Hell of a book. lt's about bunnies. You must be cold without your trunks. You bet. How about you come a little closer and warm me up? You sure know how to make a girl feel special, Sawyer. [woman] You're incredible, Sawyer. - [panting] - [sighing] l love you. Look at you. What do you want? Right now. How could l want anything else? - Uh-oh, baby. - ''Uh-oh,'' what? - l thought you had a meeting. - Yeah, but it's not until 3<i>:</i>30. Baby, it's 3<i>:</i>28. Damn it. Damn it. Baby, why don't you just... Just go. You go, okay? l'll stay here, order room service, get fat... Why don't you order a chocolate sundae. When l get back, l'll use you as a dish. [gasping] You weren't exactly supposed to see that. [rustling] [rustling] What're you doing in my stuff, son? [Jack] This is gonna hurt. [groaning] Ow. Ready to tell me what happened? We were trying to find the source of the distress call. l saw the flare from the beach and then the flare from Sawyer's position in the jungle. l switched on my antenna, activated the transceiver... ...and then darkness. Whoever hit me came from behind. - They destroyed the equipment? - Yes. We're gonna figure this out. But don't... l will do what l need to do to find the man responsible. We need some help over here! [Jack] What happened? Sawyer. Morning delivery. Aw, you're sweet. Thanks. Well, l figured in your condition, with the extra baggage, you know. - Well, l can still walk. - Barely. Anyway, l worry about you out here. You know, it's very sunny. Thus my hat. You know, there's plenty of hats in the caves. And we got a doctor. That'll come in handy. - l like the beach, Charlie. - Yeah. Who wouldn't want to spend the day with sand fleas? l want to be here. For when we get rescued. When we get rescued. Right. Ow! Jack, it's fine. lt's just a scrape. Yeah, lots of scrapes today. l'm running out of peroxide. - He just jumped me, man. - Why? - Shannon has asthma. - Asthma? - Never seen her have an attack. - She had an inhaler. She sneaks hits when no one's looking. She's been embarrassed about it since she was a kid. Guess breathing's not cool. - Had an inhaler? - lt ran out a couple days ago. But l had four refills, enough for a couple months. She forgets her medication, so l put it in my suitcase. Today l see that jackass reading Watership Down. - You're losing me. - lt was in my bags, stuff l checked. lf he has my book, he has my luggage. lf he has the luggage, he has the inhalers. Her breathing got really rough today, man. lf she has an attack, it's not gonna be good. Where is it? Hey, doc. Long time, no see. - Where is it? - Where's what? The girl's asthma medicine. - Shannon. Her inhalers. - Oh, that. You attacked a kid for helping his sister. No, l whooped a thief because he was going through my stuff... - Yours? - ...which l had to move. You take something out of a suitcase and that makes it yours? l don't know what kind of commie share-fest you're running in Cave Town, but down here, possession's nine-tenths. - Man's got a right to protect property. - Get up. - Why? You wanna see who's taller? - Get up! - Sure you wanna make this your problem? - Oh, yeah. l'm sure. [Kate] Hey. What's going on here? You told me you were going to Baton Rouge to close a deal. Just trust me. There isn't any time to explain. l'm already late. lf l miss this meeting, the whole deal's a bust, all right? That's everything l have, $1 40,000. There's an oil mining operation in the Gulf of Mexico, drilling platforms. $300,000 buys you one share. But as soon as you invest, a government-sponsored fund kicks in and triples your money in two weeks. Triples it. - Three hundred thousand? - Yeah. - You got 1 40. - l found an investor in Toronto. He wants in, 50-50. ln two weeks, we'll be splitting almost a million bucks. Jess, this is my chance. There's another option. Yeah? And what's that? That l give you the 1 60,000 and we split the profit. Yeah? And how in the hell are you gonna scare up 1 60,000 bucks? My husband. [Jack] l'm gonna kill him. - That won't help us get the medicine. - But it'll feel good. So, what's stopping you? We're not savages, Kate. Not yet. Let me talk to Sawyer. What makes you think he's gonna listen to you? - He says we have a connection. - [scoffs] - Do you? - Please. [Kate] What do you want? - Excuse me? - What do you want, Sawyer? Freckles, l got so many answers to that question, l wouldn't even know where to start. What do you want for the inhalers? Oh. Good question. Hang on a tick. What do l want? A kiss ought to do it. - What? - A kiss. From you. Right now. l don't buy it. - Buy what? - The act. You try too hard, Sawyer. l ask you to help a woman who can't breathe and you want me to kiss you? Nobody's that disgusting. l've seen you, you know. - Seen me what? - With that piece of paper. The one you keep in your pocket. l've seen the expression on your face when you read it. How carefully you fold it up. lt means something to you. So you can play games all you want, but l know there's a human being in there somewhere. Give me the medication. - You think you understand me? - Yeah. - l think l have... - Shut up! Wanna know what kind of human being l am? Read it. Read it. Out loud. ''Dear Mr. Sawyer, you don't know who l am, but l know who you are, and l know what you've done. You had sex with my mother, and then you stole my dad's money all away. So he got angry, and he killed my mother. And then he killed himself too.'' Don't stop now. You're getting to the good part. ''All l know is your name. But one of these days l'll find you and give you this letter, so you'll remember what you done to me. You killed my parents, Mr. Sawyer.'' Now, about that kiss. l didn't think so. [Sayid] Locke. Where were you last night, around sunset? [sighs] Well, l'm afraid the only witness to my whereabouts is the boar that l was skinning for our dinner. l heard you were trying to send out a distress call? So it would seem whoever attacked you has a reason for not wanting to get off the island. Maybe someone who is profiting from our current circumstances? And from what l've seen, you and Mr. Sawyer share a certain animosity. No, he has an alibi. Just before l was struck, he set off a bottle rocket, a signal we'd worked out, two kilometers away. He couldn't have had the time... Unless he found a way to time-delay the fuse on his rocket. - How could he...? - Anyone who watches television knows how to improvise a slow fuse. Use a cigarette. Just in case there's a next time. [gasping] Just try to breathe. Breathe. Come on, Shannon, work with me. - [murmuring] - [gasping] [gasping, coughing] [Jack] Give me the inhalers. Now. Hell, l was wondering when you were gonna stop asking nice. Well, it's about time, cowboy. l've been telling you since day one we're in the wild. Didn't think you had it in you. ls that all you got? [panting] [Sawyer] l'm not sure this is such a good idea. Why not? Because business between friends is always a little sticky. l don't know you well, but l know your wife, working with her at the auto dealership. l'm just not sure l'm comfortable. Louisiana will invest two-thirds of the drilling cost. What is this, a loophole? Look, David, you're reluctant. l get it. You got your lumberyard, you don't need this. - We should do this. - Jess, l don't even know this guy. Show him the cash. - How do l know this is real? - The money? Hell, how about you hold on to it for a night. Check it out. l want you to feel secure. You know what? Let's not do this. l've got another investor who's committed. That should cover lunch. And l'll see you Monday. - David. - [Jessica] David. [David] Wait. [Claire] Warm, fluffy towels. Your turn. Uh... - Banoffi pie. - You already said that. Toffee and cream. Mmm. ls food the only thing that you miss? You're pregnant. l mean, do you not crave anything? Pickles? Fried ice cream? Chocolate... Peanut butter. l'm the only Australian who loves peanut butter. l can get you peanut butter. - Yeah. Sure you can. - Yes, l can. When l get you peanut butter, you vacate this shore of depression and move to the caves. Deal? Deal. - [wheezing] - Help! She's not breathing! [Boone] The attacks are getting worse. [Jack] Shannon? Listen to me. Look at me. Look at me. You need to listen now. This isn't just the asthma. lt's anxiety. lt's in your head. Yes. You know that your medicine's run out, and you're panicking. Shannon. Look at me. But we can fight this. Together. Okay? Nod your head, Shannon. Good. - Breathe in... - She needs her inhaler. - Breathe in through the nose. Slowly. - [gasping] No, no, no. ln through the nose. Like this. You can do this, Shannon. You can do it. - ln through the nose. - [wheezing] You got your breath. Yeah, your color's coming back. See? l knew you could do this. - Do you feel it? lt's passing. - Yeah. Okay. Again. ln through the nose. - [Shannon inhales] - [Jack exhales] All right. Just keep doing that. Keep breathing like that. That's perfect. Good job. Keep her relaxed. Do not let her panic. Wow, man. That was awesome. l mean, that was like a... ...Jedi moment. Jack! What will happen if she doesn't get her medicine? Then we have to make Sawyer give it to us. Yeah. That's what l'm gonna do. No, not you. Me. l served five years in the Republican Guard. You were a communications officer. Part of my training entailed getting the enemy to communicate. Just give me ten minutes with him. He'll give us the medicine. ls that a yes? Yes. [Hurley] Food from the plane's been gone over a week, dude. [Charlie] What, no secret stash for emergencies? You and Jack have a bunch of stuff in that cave. Sorry, man. No peanut butter, no peanuts, no nothing. Yeah, but... There's got to be something. l mean, look at you. - Look at what? - No, no, listen... - Fat guy hoarding the food, you think? - No. We've been here for two weeks, you know, and you've not really... - Slimmed down? - All l need's a bag... l have no food, all right? And for the record, l'm down a notch on my belt. Oh! l'm a big guy. lt's gonna be a while before you give me a piggyback ride. Sorry. Sorry. - That was bad form. - Yeah. - l'm used to it. - So there's not even a bag of... - Dude. - Okay. [Charlie] All right. l'm sorry. Ahh! Ah! Damn, stupid... Michael? - Oh. - The sick girl. - Yeah, asthma. - Yes, asthma. l think l can help her. [footsteps] Good morning. [Kate] What are you doing? - Jack! - This was Sawyer's choice, not mine. lf you do this... Well, ain't you the brave one? Jumping a guy while he's napping. Uh-oh. l'm in trouble now, ain't l? Sawyer... We gave you the chance to do the right thing. Now, all l want is the asthma medicine. Just tell me where the inhalers are... ...and we'll stop. - Stop what, Chico? - [scraping] lt doesn't have to be this way. Yeah, it does. We do not have bamboo in lraq, although we do have something similar. Reeds. But their effect is the same when the chutes are inserted underneath the fingernails. You know what l think, Ali? l think you've never actually tortured anybody in your life. Unfortunately for us both... ...you're wrong. [groaning] [panting] That's it? That's all you got? Splinters? No wonder we kicked your ass in the Gulf... [screaming] [screaming] Sayid. Sayid! No. Don't stop now. l think my sinuses are clearing. - What the hell is wrong with you? - Perhaps losing an eye... ...will loosen your tongue. Okay! Okay. Where is it? The only person l'll tell... [panting] ...is her. - Kate? - That's the deal. [man] Tell me, Sawyer, do you want to die? [country music playing] 'Cause when a man walks into my place and tells me he left 1 60,000 of my hard-won dollars in the care of a civilian, l gotta ask myself if what l'm hearing isn't a desperate cry for the sweet release of death. The deal closed today. See, women are easy. A few Cosmos, a couple of stunts they haven't seen between the sheets and they think the scam is their idea. Now, the husbands... They need to touch the money. Smell it. Believe if they had the brass to put that case in the trunk of their family sedan and speed away, they just might have a chance at being an honest-to-gosh outlaw. Okay, Tex. You got your grift so pat... ...what did you need my money for? Where's your seed from the last couple you roped? Well, what can l say? l like earning it as much as l like spending it. Be that as it may, l know a thing or two about making people suffer. Now, you have my money, plus 50 percent by noon tomorrow, or l'll tell you all about it. So l'm here. Where is it? Happy to tell you, soon as l get that kiss. What? Are you serious? Baby, l am tied to a tree in a jungle of mystery, and l just got tortured by a damn spinal surgeon and a genuine lraqi. Of course l'm serious. You're not seeing the big picture here, Freckles. You're really gonna let that girl suffocate because you can't bring yourself to give me one little kiss? Hell, it's only first base. Lucky for you l ain't greedy. Okay. Okay. [Sawyer] Mmm. l don't have it. What? The medicine. l don't have it. Never did. The book. They said you found it in their luggage. Book washed up on shore. Went in the drink with the rest of the... [grunts] - He doesn't have it. - What? He's lying. Can't you see that? He's been lying from the beginning. He doesn't want us to get off. That's why he attacked me. - Hold on a minute. - He destroyed the transceiver! [Jack] You don't know that. Sayid. [yelling] [shrieking] You hit an artery. Keep still, damn it. Sayid, l need my stuff from the caves. My leather backpack. Go! Can you make it stop? Whose blood is that? Whose blood is that? Sawyer. You went after Sawyer and didn't tell me? She's my sister. [Shannon] Boone! Don't leave me alone, okay? [Boone] l'm not going anywhere. Okay? Okay. These the right ones? - l think l found the right tree... - Let me see. Oh, yes. Good. [Jin speaking in Korean] [speaking in Korean] [Jin] Hmm? Don't, man. l'm telling you. Don't. Let go. l know you want to. Shut up, and stop moving. You've been waiting for this. You get to be a hero again, because that's what you do. You fix everything up all nice. Tell him to let go, Freckles. We already made out. What else have l got to live for? Hey, Jack, there's something you should know. lf the tables were turned... ...l'd watch you die. [Sawyer] Alrighty. Looks like we're in the oil business. - We're cool? - Oh, we're cool. - We get the money back... - A week from tomorrow. Tripled. - You're not gonna skip town, are you? - David, for God's sake. He left all his money with us. We could've skipped town. A smart woman you got there, David. Don't let her go. Hi, baby. What are you doing up? Are you feeling better? [boy] Will you read to me? [Jessica] ln a minute, sweetheart. We have company. [David] Are you okay? Deal's off. - Excuse me? - Deal's off. Forget it. - What are you doing? - ls this a joke? - Walking away. - You're not walking out. Know what l had to do for this, all this in one day? Take your hand off me, boy. - Sawyer? - What's going on here? [Jessica] This isn't how it was supposed to work. You said we were... [David] He said? What did he say? [muted yelling] You're lucky to be alive. Jack? He went to the caves to check on Shannon. l read it again. And then again. l've been trying to figure out why you beat up Boone instead of just telling him you didn't have his sister's medication. Why you pretended to have it anyway. The thing that l keep coming back around to is that you want to be hated. And then l looked at the envelope. ''America's Bicentennial. Knoxville, Tennessee.'' You were just a kid. - Eight, maybe nine years old. - Kate. This letter wasn't written to you. You wrote this letter. Your name's not Sawyer, is it? lt was his name. He was a confidence man. Romanced my momma to get to the money. [sighs] Wiped them out clean, left a mess behind. So l wrote that letter. l wrote it knowing one day l'd find him. But that ain't the sad part. When l was 1 9, l needed six grand to pay these guys off l was in trouble with. [sighs] So l found a pretty lady with a dumb husband who had some money. And l got them to give it to me. How's that for a tragedy? l became the man l was hunting. l became Sawyer. Don't you feel sorry for me. Get the hell out. Get out! [Boone] lt was like some miracle. She showed up with that mixture. She rubbed it on Shannon's chest and ten minutes later she was breathing. [Jack grunts] Eucalyptus. Smart, Jack. Thank you. Very much. - What are you doing? - Packing your stuff. You're moving to the caves. You didn't? Peanut butter? No way. Just like you ordered. Oh. There is one thing. lt's extra smooth. That's okay. lt... lt's empty. What? No, it's not. lt's full. Full to the brim... ...with stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth, oh, God, it makes you want a glass of milk, extra smooth... [sighs] lt's the best bloody peanut butter l've ever tasted. You want some? [chuckles] Sayid? l can't stay here. What? l'm leaving. l don't know how long. Sayid, you can't... We don't know what's out there. l have worse things to fear than what's in the jungle. What l did today, what l almost did, l swore to do never again. lf l can't keep that promise, l have no right to be here. There's nowhere to go. Someone has to walk the shore and map the island. See what else there is. l can't think of a better person to do it than the only one l trust. l hope we meet again.
