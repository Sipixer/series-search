Aaron's not your responsibility! Where were you when he was born?! Where were you when he was taken?! You're not his father. You're not his family! Neither are you, Charlie. I'm sorry! This is not your island. This is our island, and the only reason you're livin' on it is 'cause we let you live on it. Right here, there's a line. You cross that line, we go from a misunderstanding to something else. It's your call, Jack. Sayid tells me that you're a cop. I was a cop. Can I ask you something? Shoot. How long do you think it would take to train an army? - Is that all of them? - All six of 'em. Just, uh, one box of ammo. At least we don't have to worry about running out anytime soon. Jack, I'm grateful that you decided to keep them all in the same place. Oh, I had to take them from Charlie-- his heroin stash. I figured it might have therapeutic value, if it ever came to that. You're just gonna leave it all in the statues? You want to break seven Virgin Marys? Be my guest. I'm superstitious. John? The combination. I'm gonna go ahead and assume that you're asking me because you're worried that I might fall off a cliff or something, that it would be irresponsible for just one of us to have access to this room, rather than this being an issue of trust. Well, there are a lot of cliffs on this island, John. All right, but I think we should agree, Jack, that if either of us need to open this door, we consult each other first. Absolutely. Right 7, left 33, right 18. You need to write it down? - Nope. I got it. - All right. And, Jack, you may want to consider locking the medicine in here, too. Why would I need to do that? Well, well... now look who had to relocate to the suburbs. Ain't that just like a woman? She keeps the house. You get the cheap-ass apartment. Man, I thought these people hated me, but I gotta hand it to you-- stealin' a baby, tryin' to drown it? Now that's a new low. Even made Locke take a swing at ya. Hell, that's like gettin' Gandhi to beat his kids. Shouldn't you be more worried about Jack ransacking your tent right now? What? What the hell do you think you're doin'? - You stole these from the hatch. - You stole them from me. What? They were in my stash when I left. I just took back what was mine. These belong to all of us, Sawyer, to the group. You don't have a stash anymore. Seriously, doc, you don't want to do this. Just give me the pills. We'll forget it ever happened. Are you threatening me? Last chance, doc. What do you want right now? Just you. - Oh, damn it. - What is it? Uh, gonna be late for that meeting I told you about. - A meeting, huh? - Yeah. You got another date, you can just say so. I can only wrap my mind around one woman at a time. but I appreciate the permission. Back in a flash, gorgeous. You weren't exactly supposed to see that. Are you serious? - What? - You're not serious. You just happen to have a suitcase full of cash, and you go to pick it up, and then the lock just happens to break? - Give me that. - It's not even real. Newspaper? Are you trying to con me? What, I ask you what all the money's for, and you do some song and dance about an investment or something and then-- and then I say, "hey, yo, I've got some money." Look, you got me. Good for you. No harm, no foul. You should have done your homework. I didn't take anything from him in the divorce. I'm not even worth your trouble. Well,  shame on me. I want you to show me what you do. Show me what you do, what you really do. And what do I do? Show me how to con people, Sawyer. I like what you've done with the place. The maid's day off. You want to move? I heard Jack took your painkillers. Yeah, well, guess me and the doc are on the outs. One less Christmas card I'll have to send this year. Maybe that'll cheer you up. It's from the hatch. I know you're hard up for new reading material. Well, as much as I'd like to learn to feather my hair... I lost my damn glasses on the raft. You want to read it to me? What, you got an appointment or something? All right, "ten ways to tell if he's a sensitive man." - This oughta be good. - Mornin'. Hey, John. Now there's a sensitive man. Claire asked him to sleep down here. Come on. Locke's got himself needs... just like anyone else. Not  everyone is like you, Sawyer. Guess that's why el Jacko and Ana Lulu ain't asked me to join their revolution. What, you didn't hear about their little army? Guess I'm not the only one on the outs with the doc. Hey, man. You gonna "put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up"? "Lime in the coconut"? The song? What do you want, Hurley? So I'm over at Rose and Bernard's tent. Did you know he's a dentist? Well, that's not all he's been holding out on us. The guy picked up Boone's signal from the norwegian plane... Nigerian. Right. Anyhow, he picked it up with this. That is a shortwave radio. It's a glorified walkie-talkie. Yeah, but can't you switch the blue wire with the red wire, make it stronger? We tried to send a signal with the plane's transceiver, and all we got was the french woman's message on a loop. Why would I bother? Come on, man, I mean, it's worth-- It's worth nothing. It's a waste of time. Just trying to cheer you up, dude. I don't need cheering up. Okay, man, sorry. No problem. Hey... Hey. Hey. You  get the combo? Nice. Didn't think it'd be that easy convincing your pal to give it up. That's the nice thing about you people-- you're not scared enough. "Not scared enough"? The same reason we can't talk anyone into joining the army. Everyone around here actually thinks they're safe. Trust me, Ana, no one thinks we're safe. So, Jack... what's the combo? I was just kidding. Oh. Vincent. What are you doing out here? Oh, man! It's really comin' down! - Get under here, Freckles! - I like the rain! Yeah, me, too, from under here. - What the hell? - That's Sun. - She all right? - She's breathing. Go get Jack. - Go get Jack! - Okay. - What happened? - Where's Jack? Was she conscious at all? - Did she say anything? - Nothin', not a word. She's okay. She's okay. She's gonna be all right. You need to let me take care of her, all right? Please. How did you find her? I heard her scream, found her out in the jungle about a half a klick from here. She was out cold, and her hands were tied. What do you mean, her hands were tied? They're back. They told us they would leave us alone. Well, John, it looks like they broke their promise. We don't even know what happened. Do we need to know? - Where'd you find her? - Just outside her garden. We should take a look around with guns. No. "No"? We arm up, we're just as likely to shoot each other as we are one of them. Okay. We'll wait for Sun to wake up. She'll tell us what happened. Then we're gonna do something about it. Sounds like a plan. They usually don't leave any trail. It's worth a look. Let me ask you something. This whole scenario make sense to you? What do you mean? Well, think about it. First off, how'd she get away? Woman doesn't weigh a hundred pounds soakin' wet. She was fightin' for her life. People are capable of almost-- You couldn't get away... and you versus Sun, hot-oil death match, my money's on you, Sheena. Thanks for your vote of confidence. It's a hood, just like the one they put over my head. No, it's not. This one's black, different weave. It's all in the details... and they're wrong. Well, if it wasn't them, then who? What are you saying, one of us did it? Who the hell would wantto go after Sun? Not much upside in scarin' the crap out of 46 people... unless you're tryin' to con 'em into joining an army. Those necklaces are junk, Sawyer. A 5-year-old could tell that. They ain't gonna be lookin' at the necklaces, they gonna be lookin' at the price tags. It's all in the details, Dimples. What if we get caught? We ain't gonna get caught. Anybody goes to the cops, only thing they're gonna remember is a guy who looks like he's been in a bar fight. You're scared, huh? A little bit. Well, here's the good news, baby-- everybody's scared. And the thing they're scared of most is missin' an opportunity. Hey. You guys want to buy some necklaces? - Where'd you get 'em? - Where do you think? You want to buy 'em or not? Hell, forget it. - Hey, how much? - Hundred a piece. - For any of 'em? - Yeah, yeah, taster's choice. I'll take the $1,200 one and the $1,300 one. Thanks. Hey, wait, wait. Hang on, man. - I'll buy some of those. - Yeah, me, too. It's Dana's birthday next week. This is perfect. They love their jewelry. $500, $600, $700. Pulse is good. Strong. You just need to-- to watch her. She's gonna be okay, man. That bump on her head-- do you think she fell or that someone hit her? I don't know. Jack, how well do you know Ana Lucia? Just... the others... I was out there with you. I heard that man say that if we stayed away, they'd leave us alone. And we've left them alone. So why would they attack us a few days later? If it wasn't them, then who was it? Like I said, how well do you know Ana Lucia? I got a couple more people interested in joining up. Yeah? Who? The big guy who lives behind Sayid and Scott. You mean Steve. Scott's dead. Scott, Steve... the point is, after what happened, people are finally willing to do something. Where  were you this morning? Lots of places. During the rainstorm? You think I had something to do with sun getting grabbed? Now where would youget an idea like that? Jack! Jack... Sun's awake. Hey. How's your head? Any pain, dizziness? Just  a little bit. Do you remember anything? I was working in my garden when Vincent ran up, then it started raining. Then there was a bag over my head, and I was being dragged. How many were there? I don't... I didn't see anything. I kicked and I fought, and I just ranas fast as I could, and then I fell... Gun. Gun! Gun. Relax, okay? Hey, what's going on? Looks like the good folks of Islandtown are about to form a posse, get themselves armed up. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Jack didn't find that horse of yours, start leadin' the charge in a big white hat. The guns. This is all her play to get her hands on the guns. Locke-- you need to go and tell him that they're coming. I need to tell him? Sawyer, please. - So what's next? - Next? The next play? I'll show you the pigeon drop. We already did that-- twice. And the Tulsa bag scam and the looky loo. - I want to do a big one. - You want to do a big what? A big con. - It's called a long con. - Okay, a long con. How does it work? It works by gettin' somebody to ask you to do something like it's their idea, but it's not their idea. It's your idea. But none of that matters, 'cause the one thing we need for the long con we ain't got... money. I have money. Sorry, Cassie, 40 grand in some mutual fund ain't money. Remember when I told you that I didn't get anything from the divorce? - Mm-hmm. - I kinda lied. - Kinda lied how much? - 600 grand. Well, hell, baby, with that kind of money, let's go find an island somewhere and sit on a beach drinkin' mojitos till we go toes up. Sawyer, for the first time in my life, I'm actually happy, and it's not really about the action or the money. It's about doing this with you. Come on. One long con? And then the mojitos. I'll think about it. Why don't you think about it in here? Hate to interrupt whatever the hell it is you're doin'. What are you doin'? I'm alphabetizing. Sure. Sun gets attacked in the jungle. You figure it's a good time to start the damn Dewey decimal system. Good thinkin'. How can I help you, James? Well, actually, John, I'm here to help you, give you the heads up. Heads up? Seems Jack's on his way over here to open your little gun closet and take whatever he needs. You should know he's not alone. Whole camp's pretty shook up about what happened to Tokyo Rose. I'm guessin' everybody's gonna wanna play cowboys and indians, and once those guns are out and about, something tells me they ain't never goin' back in. Why are you telling me this? 'Cause  it'll piss off Jack. If I were you, I'd change that combination, pronto. But that won't work. The door will just slow him down. If Jack wants to get in, he'll get in. Will you help me? Help you what? Move the guns. Move 'em where? Fine. You don't want to trust me? Lots of luck. But I can't leave the hatch unmanned. Oh, sure. You move the guns, and I'll stay here and push your damn button for you. How long till they get here? Well, that ain't my problem, Hoss. It's yours. Steak sandwich... two beers. Thank you. Aw, Shucks, you got a beer for me? You want one? Ask the lady. Well, hell, I dowant one, and, um, could I get a plate of chicken salad, white meat only, and please, god, no celery,okay, sweetheart? That's how we make it here, darlin'. So... tell me you got her. Yeah, I got her. All 600 grand? All 6. You fell for her. Oh, come on. You gotta be kidding me. - Look, it's got nothin' to do-- - Hey, I found that bitch. Her name is Cassidy. Well, I waited six months while you and Cassidy played house. - Now if you think-- - I ain't doin' it. You know what's makin' you stupid right now? It's your damn hormones. You think you're in love, but you're not. You know, a tiger doesn't change his stripes, James. You're a con man, just like me, and it's not what you do, it's what you are. Do I make myself clear? I'm sorry, man. I just can't do it. No, you're gonna do it. Because that girl-- she doesn't know you one bit. But when she finds out who you are, who you really are, she's gonna hate your guts. Yeah, well... enjoy your chicken salad, Gordy. Wait a minute. You don't walk away now. You owe me. You don't want to pay me? I'll put one in your ear, James... you and your little friend Cassidy. What are you doing here? One second. I'm, like, this close to the high score on "Donkey Kong." Now... what can I do you for? - Where's Locke? - I don't know. I think he said something about going to the store for a pack of smokes. Uh-oh, looks like we got ourselves a theft. - Who's gonna call the cops? - Where are they? Don't look at me. I was just pushin' a button. Oh, yeah. I believe these are yours. No. Sawyer... John... where are they? You moved the guns. Where are they? We had an agreement! An agreement that you were about to violate, Jack. Yes, I moved the guns. Where? Where? Where, John? Oh, are you gonna start handin' 'em out? How many? Who gets 'em? How much time before there's an accident-- another accident? I made a mistake teaching Michael how to shoot. Now he's... he could be deadfor all I know, and that-- that was my fault. I take responsibility for that, and so, yes, I'm taking responsibility for the guns. I want two guns, John! I'm sorry, Jack, that's the way it's gonna be, Jack. Two guns. Tell me where they are right now! You gave him the guns? No. I hid them. That's right, Jack. He's as stupid as you are. You two were so busy worryin' about each other, you never even saw me comin', did ya? So how 'bout you listen up? 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You took my stuff. While I was off tryin' to get us help, get us rescued, you found my stash, and you took it, divvied it up-- my shaving cream, my batteries... even my beer. And then somethin' else happened. You decided these two boys here were gonna tell you what to do and when to do it. Well, I'm done taking orders. And I don't want my stuff back. Shaving cream don't matter. Batteries don't matter. Only thing that matters now... are guns... and if you want one, you're gonna have to come to me to get it! Oh, you want to torture me, don't ya? Show everybody how civilized you are. Go ahead. But I'll die before I give 'em back. And then you'll really be screwed, won't you? There's a new sheriff in town, boys. Y'all best get used to it. What's goin' on? Where were you? Sawyer, what happened? You see that black car? - Who is it? - His name's Gordy-- - my partner. - What partner? If I don't walk out the frontdoor with that briefcase in the next two minutes, we're both dead. What happened? That's the guy from the Mercado deal? There is no Mercado deal! I knew about the 600 grand you had tucked away from the get-go. Cass... you were the long con. Son of a... Go to hell! Go to hell! You gotta understand-- Everything that's happened between us in the past six months, all of it-- it was real. Get out. You get out! Listen, you can hate me all you want later, but right now you gotta listen to me. He's gonna kill us, 'cause I told him I wasn't gonna take your money. Oh, my god. Look, let's just... Okay. This is what we're gonna do-- I want you to go out back through Evan's yard. There's a rental car parked out front. Go to Sioux city. I want you to check in the Sage Flower motel. It's off highway 29. Watch TV, have a drink. Wait for me. I'll be there in the A.M., And it'll all be over. - Let me just pack a few-- - There's no time. Hey, remember when you said I was all you ever wanted? Well, now you know better. I love you. I love you, too. Go. Go. How'd you do it? How'd I do what? Locke said that he left you in the hatch when he went to hide the guns, and we both know you can't track worth a damn. So how'd you get them? A magician never tells his secrets. You played us. You played me. All that stuff you said about Ana Lucia-- you knew I would go to Jack, and you knew I'd ask youto go to Locke. Now how in the world would I know all that? Did you have anything to do with Sun? What kind of a person you think I am? What kind of a person do I think you are? I don't think this has anything to do with guns or with getting your stash back. I think you want people to hate you. Good thing you don't hate me, Freckles. Why do you have to do this? You run, I con. A tiger don't change his stripes. Hey, check this out-- I found a manuscript in one of the suitcases. It's like a mystery book. I want to show you something. - Cool! You fixed it! - We'll see. Hold on to this. Don't expect anything. The chances of getting a signal are slim at best. Static's good, right? No. Reception is good. - Wait, what's that?! - It's Rousseau's signal. Ah, crap. But this radio has a wider bandwidth. Hold it! Stop! Do you hear that?! Duke ellington orchestra featuring Cootie... trumpet. Up next on wx... the Glenn Miller orchestra with "Moonlight Serenade." Whoa. You hear how clear that is? It's gotta be close, right? Radio waves at this frequency bounce off the Ionosphere. They can travel thousands of miles. It could be coming from anywhere. Or any time. Just kiddin', dude. He never saw you, huh? No. He was more worried about his sodding guns than being followed. Hmm. Figured you'd want your friends back. If I wanted them, I would have taken them before I told you where they were. That's not why I did it. It's not, huh? I wanted him to look like a fool, to feel like a fool. Well, well. Looks like Johnny Locke's got himself a nemesis. Sun can never find out what I did to her. Never. Don't sweat it. They got bigger things to worry about now. Sawyer... this idea... all of this, what we did-- what made you... how does someone think of something like that? Now go. One Mississippi... two Mississippi... three Mississippi... four Mississippi... five Mississippi... I'm not a good person, Charlie. Never did a good
