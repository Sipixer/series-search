- We have to fire the flare. - It doesn't make-- Look, are you gonna give me the damn gun, or am I gonna have to take it? Please, god. It's coming back! It's coming back! We're gonna have to take the boy. What? What'd you say? The boy-- we're gonna have to take him. - Hey! - Dad! - No! - Dad! Dad! Help me! - Walt! - Help me, dad! No, no, no. Stop it! Stop it! We can't! Locke found a... a hatch in the ground. Sun comes up in three hours, and we're all gonna be here to see that happen. We're gonna stay here tonight, okay? Together. - John, what are you doing? - I'm going in. Locke's going into that thing whether you like it or not. I'm going in the hatch. Live together, die alone, right? Right. John! I think there's something down here! Dad, please! Dad! Walt! Walt! Mike?! Sawyer! Hang on, Mike! Hang on, Mike! Hang on! Mike! Aah! Mike. Mike? Mike! Kate! Kate! Kate! - Where's Walt? - I don't know. - Where is he? - I don't know. Where the hell is my son?! Walt! How'd you hurt your leg? Got hit by a car. Ow. Yeah. So this is the paperwork your ex-wife sent over. She's not my ex-wife, man, she's-- she's just Walt's mother. She, uh-- Susan-- she just got a job in Rome with her boyfriend. They wanna take Walt with 'em. Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna take real good care of you, Mr. Dylan. Dawson. Right. Sorry. Dawson. So this boyfriend-- this is this guy Brian Porter? Yeah. Why? What's it say? It seems that Susan wants you to relinquish your rights as Walt's father so that Mr. Porter can adopt him. She wants me to sign my son away? It's the only way they can proceed with the adoption, yeah. Listen, if you sign this document, legally, he'll be no different than any other kid you pass on the street. You'd be giving up your paternal rights-- all of them. Yeah, so then can I stop her from going? Ooh, I guess we could file an injunction so she couldn't leave the city, but-- Yeah, that. I wanna do that. Right. Um, Mr. Dawson. The fact that you came in through these doors-- that tells me something. It tells me that I'm the best that you can afford. If we go forward with this, it's gonna take money-- a lot of it, even at my rates. This is David and Goliath, so I gotta ask you, are you sure you wanna do this? They're not taking my son away. Walt! Walt! Walt! Mike! You should save your energy. They took my son. Yeah, I saw that-- onto a boat, which means he's not in shoutin' distance. You don't know that. Well, I got a pretty good sense. And even if he was, there's nothing you can do. Look, if he can hear me, he knows that I'm alive, that I'm coming for him, that I'm going to get him back! Right now all I've got is that maybe my son can hear me. Does that make any sense to you? Yeah. W alt! Walt! Kate? Kate! - John. - Easy. Easy. Easy. Behind you. Are you him? Are you him? Jin! Jin! J in! Thought we had to save our energy. Yeah, well... Jin's still out there in the water, so if it's okay by you, I'm gonna keep shoutin' awhile. Jin! Feeling guilty? What? You made me fire that flare. I made you fire... What, this is my fault?! They took my son. They found us, took Walt, because you made me fire the flare. Well, at least Walt is on a boat, probably wrapped in a blanket with a cup of cocoa, - While we're on this piece-- - Get off my raft. What? Get-- What the hell is that? I see you managed to hold onto your best friend there. Thing ain't gonna work anyway. - It'll work. - You were underwater. What do you know about guns anyway, hoss? It'll work. If the bullets are dry, the powder's dry. If the powder's dry... Oh, my-- what the hell is that? It's a shark. It's only a shark. "It's only a shark"? That's supposed to make me feel better? Well, I guess I know why the shark is hanging around-- your shoulder. Oh, well, I'll just stop bleedin', then. You suddenly forget what happened, why I got shot? What? I mean, how abouta little gratitude here? I mean, how about a thank you? A thank you? For what? For you trying to save your own ass? You want me off this raft? You got it. I was trying to save your damn kid. Let's talk about Walt, shall we, Mr. Dawson? Uh, sure. Okay. When was the last time you actually saw your son? Um, about a year ago. It was 14 months, actually. Is that a question, Lizzy? Why is that, Mr. Dawson? Why so long? Susan took him to Amsterdam, for work. And you didn't have a problem with that? Excuse me? Well, since she's now going to Rome, and you're filing an injunction. Just seems a little inconsistent to me. Incon-- no. - No, don't. Don't do-- - No, no, no. She's baiting you. Don't answer. She took him, though. - I didn't want her to go. - Michael, please don't talk. You said there was nothing I could do. And you didn't do anything, did you? He's not gonna answer that question. That's because there is no answer. You were in an accident recently, hmm? Yeah. You had several surgeries, spent weeks in a private hospital room, extensive rehabilitation. Who paid for all of that, Mr. Dawson? I didn't ask you for anything. Could the record reflect that Mr. Dawson acknowledged that Miss Lloyd paid his bills? Susan, tell them that I didn't ask you for anything. Please don't address my client directly. Do you know what Walt's first words were, Mr. Dawson? - I'm sorry. What? - His first words. Do you know what they were? I... no. I wasn't there. Do you know what his favorite food is? - Do you-- - No. Okay, this is unnecessary. No. Well, for someone who wants to retain his paternal rights so badly, you don't seem to know much about your son, Mr. Dawson. I'm his father. I'm sorry. Could you say that louder, please, just for the record? I'm his father. Hey, are you crazy? You  gonna take a bullet out with your bare hands? You got a better idea? Then go to hell. You're never gonna be able to do it by yourself. I thought we parted ways, Mike. We're caught in the same current. You still talking? Come on. You got a band-aid? Are you? Are you him? Yes. Yes, I am. I can't believe it. You're finally here. Well... here I am. Who's she? She's with me. What did one snowman say to the other snowman? I don't know what you're talking about. Get rid of the knife. You're not him! We didn't come here to hurt you. Yeah? Then why did you come? We were in a plane crash. Were you now? And when was that? 44 days ago. 44 days? Move. - How long have you been down here? - Shut it. Tie him up. Do it! Wait, wait, wait. You're tying up the wrong person. How's that, brother? It's pointless to tie me up. I'm not dangerous. But her, she's a fugitive. So what does that make you then, brother? I'm a regional collections manager for a cardboard manufacturer. Boxes, primarily. All right, then, box man, tie her up. - Don't you think about touch-- - Hey! You be a good girl, right? What do you think you're doing? Doing what's best for all of us. Right, bring her here. John. Hey. Wait! Hey! Shut it. Wait! You're kidding, right? You're going back? Yeah. What about all that stuff you said about waiting till morning and watching the sunrise? I changed my mind. What do you suppose all that's about? I reckon Jack's gonna do something heroic. What? You always try to be funny when you don't want to answer a question. - "Try to be funny"? - Hmm. What's this? Oh. Found it in the jungle. - You found it? - Yeah. Be careful. Be careful with it. Here. Here. Take Aaron. Come here. There you go. You gotta be careful there. You know, it's the Virgin Mary. She's holy. Didn't realize you were so religious. I'm not. It's just, you know, it might come in handy. Be a nice thing to have around. Yeah. It wasn't the flare. I said, it wasn't the flare. Those people that did this-- at first, I thought they were fishermen or pirates or something. Then I got a good look at their boat. You know anything about boats, Mike? Boat like that wasn't built for the open ocean. Water's comin' over the side, first little squall. Maybe got a range of a hundred miles. A boat like that had to have left port from somewhere close, like the island. French chick said the others were coming for the kid. I think they came, Mike. What? He's the one they wanted, why I got a bullet in my shoulder. Hell, Bluebeard blew us up because they wanted your kid. - You saying this is my fault? - Yeah. That's what I'm sayin'. They took my son because of you. - Me? - They were sailing away! They found us because they were looking for us, for Walt! Don't you ever say his name again, ever! What you gonna do, splash me? - Look, I know how-- - Shut up. Don't even. You have no idea what it's like to care for somebody else. Hi. Where  are your lawyers? I told them I wanted to talk, just you and me. But if you want yours, I understand. No. That's okay. I think you're gonna win. Excuse me? In court. I think you're gonna keep me from leaving the country with Walt. But I just... have to ask you why. Why what? Why are you doing this? He's my son. Since when, Michael? Look, I know you don't care about what's best for me, but in Rome, I'll be a senior partner at the firm. I'll be able to give Walt anything he needs. You're still on disability, Michael. You can't work. You're about to be evicted from your apartment. You got your lawyers checking up on me now? Well, of course I did, just like you had your lawyers checking up on me. - Nobody's winning here. - Then stop. Michael, the first thing you need to do is take care of yourself. You need to get healthy. You need to get back on your feet financially so that you can get back to pursuing your art. You have rare talent as an artist, Michael. But how are you gonna do that, any of that, and still be a part of Walt's life? I'll do it by doing it. Walt is my responsibility, too. Then let him go. Because it's not about you or me. It's about him. I don't wanna go to court, Michael. So please just... let him go. The pilot said we had lost radio contact, but by then, we were already a thousand miles off course. Any search teams would have given up weeks ago. So you were traveling from Sydney to Los Angeles? Yes. So they're all still out there? Yeah, as far as I know. Could you tell me your name? My name? My name is Desmond. Desmond, I'm John. You should know, the gun is really unnecessary. Oh, yeah? So I should just hand it over to you then, should I? How many of you are there? Uh, 43, but 4 sailed out this morning on a raft. A raft? That simulated sunlight-- is that because you never leave? Is there another way out? How many of your group have gotten sick? Sick? Sick-- as in ill, as in dead. Is that why it says "quarantine" on the inside of the hatch? Answer the question. No one has. No one. No one's sick. Get up. Move. Stand right there. Do you know how to use this, box man? I haven't seen one of those in 20 years. - Do you know how to use it?! - Yes. Sit. Right, now listen carefully. Type in exactly what I tell you, understand? Exactly. Nothing else. 4. 8. 15. Did you hear that? What? What did you just put in? What number did you just put in?! - 15. - Right. 16. 23. 42. Now press "execute." Uh... what's gonna happen? Just push it! Kate! Locke! Who the hell is that? That would be Jack. Who is he? His name is Jack. He's our doctor. What's he doing here? Well, to be honest with you, I'm a little surprised to see him. Your doctor has a gun, brother. Move. Make one sound and I'll shoot. Move. Jack! Jack! Jack! I wouldn't do that, Jack. Where's Kate? What the hell did you-- Move... and I kill him. - Put the gun down. - Where's Kate? - Jack, it's okay. - I said drop it! - Where's Kate?! - She's fine.Just put down-- I'm not putting down anything. Do you want him to die? Put it down. Is this what you were talking about, Locke? Is this your destiny? "All roads lead here." Calm down. Lower your gun, or I'll blow his darned head off, brother! You. What the hell is that? Part of the raft-- one of the pontoons. Stop paddling. Hey, stop it! You're putting a strain on the vines. It's going to break us up. Damn it, you're gonna-- Sawyer! Climb up. I do, and we both sink. I'm going for the pontoon. Don't be an idiot. You see that toothy son of a bitch, you aim and squeeze. Got it? Got it. Come on, come on, come on. Sawyer? Sawyer! Sawyer! Give me your hand. There he is. Do you see him? - Hi. - Oh! Hey. Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. Packing's been a disaster, and the plane leaves first thing in the morning. Sure. No problem. Uh, hey, do you want to say hi, Walt? Hi, Walt. I'm... I'm... Hey, uh, this is for you, man. He like bears? Yes. Uh, sure. He's just really shy. Hey, little man. Oh, I guess I can't call you that. I mean, 'cause look how big you are. So... you and I, we're not gonna see each other for awhile, Walt. Uh, but you are gonna have a great life. I know your mommy-- she's gonna take real good care of you, and Brian is... gonna take good care of you, too. But you know what? I just want you to know that no matter where you go, I... that your daddy... yeah, your daddy-- he loves you very, very much. And I always will. Always. Okay? I'm sorry. He's... No. It's okay. It's okay. Uh... Hey, here. Uh... Just, you know... You know, let him know it's from me sometime, okay? Okay. Good-bye, Michael. Yeah. Bye. It's... uh... You all right, Mike? It was my fault. What? I never should have brought him on the raft. I'm gonna get him back. I'm gonna get back my son. Well, how about that? Current brought us back. We're home. Jin? - Michael! Sawyer! - Jin! Oh, oh, oh! Jin, what's wrong? Others. Others. Others. What? Others! Others! What?
