Jack, I need your help. They're not hers. She's gone. The plane was loaded with heroin. Where did you find this? In the jungle. I found it in the jungle. Take me there. Eko? Who's that? He's my brother. Forgive me. Forgive me. Here, eat. It's okay, Yemi. Eko. All right, Eko. Go. Did you hear me? Go. Confess that you have stolen. Yemi was hungry. That is not an excuse. You have sinned, Eko. Hunger does not matter. Now go. Ask God for forgiveness. Confess! How long has he been like this? Couple days, now. Eko, can you hear me? What happened to him? Before or after we saved him from the polar bear cave? Come on. Locke will want to know you guys are back. Stay alive, dude. Okay? What are you doing here? I have come to give my confession. Hello, Eko. Hello, brother. I have some merchandise that I need to get out of the country. You mean drugs. You make us priests and we will fly the drugs out ourselves. My signature does not make you a priest, Eko. You could never be a priest. No more! Stop now! Father. Are you okay, father? Eko. Eko, wake up. It is time to confess... to be judged, brother. I will be waiting. You know where to find me. You guys smell smoke? Get him clear! Help me! Bring him out. Bring him out. - We gotta get outta here. - Cover him with this. Be careful! Be careful! Lay him down. You're okay. You're all right. My brother... My... brother. You're all right. It's okay. Okay. You're all right. I'll be back. Brother... Yemi... Charlie! - Is everyone okay? - Yeah. We're good. Where's Eko? Hurley and I pulled him out over... he was right there. Good evening, Jack. Good evening, Ben. I was hoping you might join me for a walk. What? Well, you say that like... you're not gonna just throw a bag over my head and drag me outta here if I say no. Then don't say no. Why don't you put this on? I'll wait outside. Does it hurt? Sorry? Your neck, does it hurt? Any numbness in your fingers and toes, like pins and needles when your foot falls asleep, but permanent? Why are you asking me these questions, Jack? Because, Ben, you have a tumor on your spine-- an aggressive tumor... that is going to kill you. I don't know when those X-rays were taken that I saw, but unless they were very recent... you're not gonna be taking walks much longer. I have no idea what you're talking about. Okay. My mistake, then. I'm ready whenever you are. Stay here. As we prepare to send Colleen on her way, I'd like to take a moment... I hate funerals. He let you out? Gave me a new shirt, too. Bye, Jack. Why did you show him my X-rays? I didn't tell him they were yours... But I guess you did. I think I know how to find Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Can I ask why he's being included in the conversation? Is that supposed to hurt my feelings? Tell him what you told me. The computer in the hatch wasn't only for pushing the button. I'm pretty sure that it can be used to communicate with other stations. This is fascinating, but you just told me the hatch exploded. One of them did. You want to try and communicate with the others. Yep. No luck, dudes. We looked everywhere. Eko's gone. There was no trail. Not that we, like, know what a trail looks like. When you pulled him out of the tent, did he say anything? Nothing coherent. He was just mumbling "my brother, my brother." Sayid, pack your gear. We're going to that computer. Wait. What about Eko? We'll catch up to him. We're all going to the same place. You're home, father. Father? I was looking for father Yemi. Father Yemi is... Is gone. He was called away quite suddenly... an emergency at the refugee camp down south. I am Amina. I work at the clinic. This is my son Daniel. He's the altar boy here. Are you taking his place? Yes. Will father Yemi still go to London? - London? - He was leaving at the end of the week. He was going to continue his studies. I will take his place there, too. Don't! No! Please! Confess. We're headed now to the Pearl station. There's a computer there that might help us find our people. Anybody want to come along? What do you mean: "Anybody wanna come along"? I mean, if you'd like to join us, it's a free island. Yeah, see, Jack would go and do stuff alone or he'd take Sayid or Kate. Yeah, well, I'm not Jack. The more the merrier. I'll go. - Great. - What? Anybody else wanna come, meet us at the tree line in ten minutes. Bring water. You're not serious. What? You always whine about not being included. Now's our chance. Do you mind if I ask you a question, brother? Shoot. Are we going off to poke at a computer, or are we going after your man Eko? Two birds, one stone. Eko's heading for the plane that crashed on top of the entrance to the Pearl station. Well, that's quite a coincidence. Don't mistake coincidence for fate. You're not supposed to do that. That's holy water. I'm washing away my sins. - Father Yemi would never... - I'm not father Yemi. Wait there! Where... Where is father Yemi? Who wants to know? Perhaps you did not hear me. I said, where is father Yemi? The shipment is late. I just got off the telephone. They assure me it will arrive on Friday. What shipment? You should explain our arrangement to your new priest. We receive shipments of vaccines from the Red Cross. We are allowed to keep 20%. The rest, we give to Emeka and his men. In exchange for protection. So you see, father... everybody is happy, huh? Everybody's happy. Everybody benefits. So I hope you will continue to honor our arrangement. I am not afraid of you. I'll be back for the vaccine on Friday, father. You don't want more lives on your conscience. Hello, Eko! You wanna guess what's for lunch? I'm not... I'm not big on mysteries. Of course you're not. You people have cheeseburgers? You have no idea what I went through to make this for you. I killed the cow, processed the meat, baked the bun. And the fries... try rendering animal fat. No ketchup? I'd like to talk to him. Okay, so talk to him. Alone, please. I'm fine with her being here. And I'm thrilled that you're fine, Jack, but it's private. Doctor-patient confidentiality? Sure. Sure. Of course. Mind if I eat? We had such a wonderful plan to break you, Jack. Break me? Wear you down until you were convinced we weren't your enemies. Get you to trust us. And then, of course, we'd lead you to believe that you were choosing to do whatever we asked you to do. All of this assumed, of course, that you would get invested. Invested in what? Has it not occurred to you that Juliet bears a striking resemblance to your ex-wife? Why are you telling me this? I'm telling you this, Jack, because my wonderful plan got shot to sunshine when you saw my damned X-rays and figured out I was dying. All of this... you brought me here to operate on you. You... you want me to save your life. No, I want you to want to save my life. But we're beyond that now, so... all I can ask is that you think about it. Do you believe in God, Jack? Do you? Two days after I found out I had a fatal tumor on my spine, a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky. And if that's not proof of God, I don't know what is. You sure you're all right? We can stop for a bit and catch our breaths. I'm fine. You're heading for the plane wreckage, aren't you? Charlie heard you call out for your brother before you left the camp. Is that what you're doing out here, looking for Yemi? Do not speak my brother's name again. What are you so afraid of, Eko? You need to come back in two days. Father. What can I do for you? It's that the vaccines that you spoke of... how often do the shipments come? Every six months, if we are lucky. What makes you so interested in our shipments of vaccine, father? You agreed to give most of it to the militia? The vaccines fetch a high price on the black market. Whatever you are thinking, do not cross these men. Before father Yemi, we got nothing. We owe whatever vaccines we have to his work. You remind me of him, you know. You are a good man, too. I hear you have some vaccine to sell. I do, but it has to be done by Sunday. I'm leaving the country. No problem. The hatch is over here by the plane. Why don't you take everybody down? And you? I'll be there in a minute. What's Eko looking for? His brother's body's in that plane. So... what exactly did you see back there? I saw it once, you know. What did you see? I saw a very bright light. It was beautiful. That is not what I saw. My brother's gone. You set the plane on fire. Yemi's body could have burned. Not to mention animals or... so... you don't wanna come down there with us? No, I will wait here. Well... Oh, I forgot. I found this when I was looking for you. Hello, father. I hear you have a shipment of vaccine for sale. If you thought you could do this without me knowing, you don't know who I am. You know... you're lucky, father. I'm a superstitious man. I don't relish taking the life of a holy man. That is why, today, I'm only going to cut off your hands. Please! No! You do not know who I am. I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund, and this is the orientation film for station five of Dharma Initiative. Station five, or the Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in Dharma Initiative projects</i> can be observed and recorded... Well? The wiring is only one way. It's a closed system, a dead end. Hey, guys? What are these other TVs for? Sorry? All these TVs. This guy says that there's six stations. All right, here. Check it out. ...is a monitoring station where the activities of the participants in Dharma Initiative projects</i> can be observed and recorded... Projects. More than one. So maybe some of these TVs are connected to the other hatches. Well, I'm suddenly feeling very stupid. Perhaps I could patch in one of the other feeds, see if we can get another picture. Your tour of duty in the Pearl will last three weeks...</i> The toilet still works. Anything yet? Nothing. What about now? Yeah, we got something. What is it? That's a good question. Those are computers. Great. That's what you're looking for. Now we can get out of here. I guess he'll be expecting us. You don't trust me anymore? I trust you just fine. Just thought I'd put a movie in. You know what? I'm gonna pass on the movie. You'll like this one, Jack. It's "To kill a mockingbird." It's a classic. I don't wanna watch a movie right now. I'll turn the sound down, then. I felt like I should apologize, say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for bringing you here and for everything that's been done to you and your friends. But you have to know... we were desperate. It was all so we could save his life. Ben... he's a great man. I know you find that hard to believe, but he is. You probably feel like... you don't have a choice, but you do, Jack. Free will is all we've really got, right? Anyway... just wanted to put in my two cents. I told you before you can trust me. I want you to trust me now, when I tell you that doing the surgery is absolutely the right thing for you to do. It's the right thing, because he deserves  to live. Turn the movie off. Turn it off. Now. All right. It's off. Think about what I said... please. Where are you going? London. Are you a bad man? My mom says you are a bad man. Only God knows. I see you have your vaccine. Do you expect me to be grateful? I know what you were planning to do. Those men, I helped... Those men will be replaced by other men. What are they doing? What is the meaning of this? They are boarding up the church. We can no longer use it. This is Yemi's church. You have no right to do this. It is no longer sacred, and one day, you'll be judged for what you did. If I were you, I would start making my peace now. I would go to London and begin to repent, because you owe God for every life you've taken. And you truly believe this is Yemi's? You owe him one church. Wait. You say you want to hear my confession. Why? Why now, eh? Show yourself! Where are you?! Where?! Are you ready, Eko? Yes. I am ready, Yemi. I ask for no forgiveness, father... for I have not sinned. I have only done what I needed to do to survive. A small boy once asked me if I was a bad man. If I could answer him now, I would tell him that when I was a young boy, I killed a man to save my brother's life. I am not sorry for this. I am proud of this. I did not ask for the life that I was given, but it was given nonetheless. I did my best. You speak to me as if I were your brother. Who are you? Who are you?! Who are you?! Who are you? The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want... It's okay. It's okay. What did he say, John? He said...
