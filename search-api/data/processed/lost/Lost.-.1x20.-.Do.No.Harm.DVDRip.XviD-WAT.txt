People are talking about what we're doing. - Tell them. - They're not ready. - l saw a Beechcraft. - What is inside of it? You're gonna have to climb up there. Anybody out there? Mayday! Help! - What happened? - An accident. Boone fell off a cliff. Tell me exactly what happened. John? Locke! Come on. Out of the way! Come on. Out of the way! l need room. - Keep him steady. - Can you hear me? What happened? - He was with Locke. - Keep him steady. - He's bleeding. - l know he's bleeding. Keep him steady, damn it! You gotta press harder. - l'm trying. - All right. Slow and gentle. Easy! Sun, pair of scissors in the second drawer of the cart. Second drawer. There are diapers in the drawer. Sun's gonna switch with you. - Sun, l need... - Yes, l understand. Grab me that seat from up there. l need that mesh. We need to create some sterile... - l swear to God, if you faint... - No. First class, mesh. l'm cool. - Lord. - Get to the beach. Ransack Sawyer's stuff. l want his alcohol. - Rubbing, scotch... - [Boone gasping] [Kate] Jack, what's going on? His lung just collapsed. OK. [Jack] OK. OK. Good, Boone. Good, Boone. That's good. Good job. All right. l'm gonna put a tube in that, and you're gonna be just fine. What are you still doing here? Alcohol. You want him to live? Get to the beach! Now! [Boone wheezing] Damn it. Just get the clip-on. You know why they call it a tie? 'Cause you gotta tie it. Know why they call it a clip-on? You clip it on. - You nervous? - What do l have to be nervous about? - lt's a big responsibility. - l can handle responsibility. You don't like to get up in front of crowds. l'll be fine. After eight beers, l'll be fine. - She'll bust you, man. - l'll brush my teeth. She'll bust you. You can still back out, Marc. No, it's just a stupid speech. l'll make you proud. OK, groom's turn. You can still back out, Jack. [Boone] Oh, it hurts. lt's a closed fracture, but l think l can set it. - [Boone] l'm gonna die. - His chest. The wound. Can you sew him? He's lost a lot of blood. l don't know how far Locke had to carry him. Listen. Listen! You are not gonna die. l'm gonna fix this, OK? l am going to save you. [Michael] You gotta flip them or they'll burn, Walt. [Sawyer] Hey, <i>mamacita!</i> Want some fish? No, thanks. l'm not really hungry. How long do you think? Till it's ready? Maybe a week. Maybe less. You OK? Yeah, l'm fine. All right, l'll see you guys later. She likes me. [Michael] Hey, Jin! Want some fish? Take a break. Eat some fish. [Sawyer] Man's got an overzealous work ethic. Try ''obsession''. He wants off this island bad, man. Can't say l blame poor Kato. His lady speaks English all this time, and he didn't have a clue? Surprised he didn't swim outta here. - Hell, l would've. - Sawyer, l need all your alcohol. Now! How'd it happen? Locke said that he fell off a cliff while they were out hunting boar. The boar they never seem to get? - ls that it? - Afraid so. You need anything else? - l can come with you. - Too many cooks already. But thanks. [Boone] l'm sorry. l'm really sorry. [wheezing] l'm sorry. [wheezing] - He needs blood. - [Sun] What? Blood. A transfusion. - How will you do... - l don't know. We'll figure it out. After l set the leg. - Let me. - No, that's OK. Let me. Get some air. How is he? - Don't know yet. - What happened out there? - Where's Locke? - l don't know. - What? He just took off? - Yeah. - Charlie, he just took off. - Where's Shannon? - l don't know. - She's his sister. l don't know where she is! [Marc] And here she is, the future Mrs. Jack Shephard. Thank you, Marc. Wow! Can l get another microphone? l think this one's been drinking. [laughter] A little over two years ago, l blew a tire out, flipped over the center divider into oncoming traffic and was hit head-on by an SUV. My back was broken. They all said it was irreparable. And then there was Jack. And he promised that he would fix me. Because that's the kind of guy he is. Because you are the most committed man l have ever known. Because you fixed me, l will dance at our wedding. - To Jack. - [glasses clinking] My hero. Jack. [applause] Give him this for the pain. l think we're a little beyond herbal remedies here. lt is not a remedy. Will you hold his shoulders? Here we go. [Boone screams] Ah! [groaning] Come on. [groaning] [groaning, panting] [panting] Claire? What are you doing out here? Nothing. Just leave me alone, please. [groaning] Oh, God. You're having the baby. Um, Claire, we need to get you back to camp. l'm fine. l just need to catch my breath. lt's not OK. You're having your baby. No, l'm not. lt's just gas pains. - You're having contractions. - No, l'm not! - Just leave me alone. - l gotta get you to Jack. - Please, try to stand. - Look, l can't! Help! Somebody, help! Help! Help! Please help! [Kate] Help! [Kate] Please help! Somebody, help! Help! - Oh. - [gasping] [speaking Korean] Hey, Jin! l need you to go to the caves and get Jack. OK? Understand? - We need Jack. - Jack. Doctor. - Yes, doctor. Please come here. - Oh, this one's big. - Don't leave me. - Oh, no, honey, l won't. l'm not going anywhere, OK? l promise. Jack. Hurry. - Ask him again. - He's in shock. That's why you need to ask him again. Boone, can you hear me? What is your blood type? Boone, please listen. What is your blood type? Damn it. - Maybe a smaller piece. - Veins are like a wet noodle. First you have to find one, then you have to have a hollow needle sharp enough to actually pierce it. l've got bamboo. None of that matters because l don't know his blood type. - Not to mention his injuries... - [Boone] A-negative. - Boone, what'd you say? - Oh, Shannon, the plane. Did you hear ''A-negative''? Get Charlie. Ask everyone you can find what their blood type is. A-negative, OK? And find his sister. Find Shannon. Where are we going? - This way. - Oh, OK. Are you lost? No. Absolutely not. Those trees look really familiar. lt's this way, l think. Did you say ''l think''? [Sayid] Surprise. Damn it. l found an ''A''. - Positive or negative? - She doesn't know. l also found two B-positives and one A/B-negative. At least he thinks so. - Did you find any O-Negatives? - Sun said A-Negative. - Where is she? - We split up. l thought she'd be here. - And you only asked four people? - l asked the whole sodding camp. No one knows their blood type. l don't know my blood type. - Did you find Shannon? - No. l was getting you this. A hollow needle. Sharp enough to pierce a noodle. lt's perfect. Not to rain on your parade, but l thought you said we needed A-negative. - Or O-negative. - Right. Which no one is. Someone is. - You! Why'd you make me... - O-neg is ''universal donor''. lt's in the ballpark. lt's not a match. My blood could put him into anaphylactic shock. Stop his heart. You mean he'll die? He's not gonna die. Those girls are checking you out. You're in your pj's. lndeed l am. - Are they cute? - Who? The girls who are checking me out. Mm... One of them's kinda cute. The other one's just trashy. - <i>Heart and Soul?</i> - You got it. - l'm taking the easy part. - Of course. You know you don't have to do this if you don't want to. How do you know l haven't? Because you haven't. - [plays off-key note] - Sorry. lt was a silly idea. l read too many bridal magazines. - l think it rotted my brain. - Sarah, l want to. l'm going to. l just have to figure out the right way to say it. Just vows. Just vows. Hey... - He's gonna come. - Yeah. l... l know. So you stay down here as long as you need to. And when you're ready, l'll be upstairs. l cannot wait to marry you, Jack Shephard. [Jin] Jack! Jack! - Jack. Doctor. Jack. - Jack. [speaking Korean] - Claire! - Claire? What about Claire? He says Claire's with Kate. She's in labor. Claire's having the baby? Where? He says he thinks she's OK, but she's in pain. Does he know how fast the contractions are coming? - Every two minutes. - ls she nauseous? Can she stand? ls there any bleeding? Did her water break? No, none of that. - But she can't move. - We should go. What do we need? Towels? Bandages? Hot water? - How do we take water? - You'll figure that out. Tell Jin to take Charlie and go back to Claire. l can do that. That dilating thing, how do you look for that? Listen to me. Tell Kate... Charlie, look at me. Tell Kate to wait until the contractions are 60 seconds apart. You got that? She's gonna need to make sure Claire pushes, but not too hard, not too fast, just until the head is clear, and then as hard as she can. When the baby is out, make sure she clears its nose and its mouth. - But you'll be there by then, right? - No, l won't. l'm not going anywhere. l need to stay here. And you tell Kate... ...she's gonna have to deliver this baby. They've stopped. - That happens, l think. - No. They're not coming anymore. - l'm fine. l'm OK. - Claire... - No. l'm OK. Really. - l don't think that you should be... - What is that? - l think your water just broke. No, no. l can't have the baby now. - Just hold on. - l can't have the baby now! Jack's coming. Claire, he's coming. [raspy breathing] l screwed myself up pretty bad, huh? [Jack] Hey. My leg hurts. Don't try to move it. - Can you breathe OK? - lt fell on me. - What fell? - A plane. lt was a plane. Boone? Boone. Locke said you fell from a cliff. No, it was... lt fell... the plane. lt's because of the hatch. - We found the hatch... - Boone? Boone? Stay with me, man. Stay with me. Locke said... John... John said... not to tell. - They built a hatch. - What'd Locke do? What hatch? My leg hurts. Boone? Boone. Hey. Shannon... Shannon. Shannon. Shannon. Shannon. l need to tell you something. All right. My brother, Boone, he's not really my brother. He's my stepbrother. Our parents got married when we were, like, eight and 1 0. He's kind of in love with me. ln love with you? And how do you feel towards him? l'll always feel something for him, but am l in love with him in that way? No. Not at all. We're here for God knows how long, and so is Boone. Maybe we should go back. - l don't wanna go back. - Are you sure? Yes. l just need to take it a little slow. Are you OK with that? l had no expectations. Right. Hopes. Not expectations. [chuckles] [gasping] Oh, God, that hurts. [Charlie] Hello? Hey, Kate. Claire. - ls she OK? - Where's Jack? - He couldn't come. - What? He's pouring his own blood into Boone's arm right now. OK, we'll just have to pick her up and bring her to him. - No, Kate. - We have to, before it's too late. [Claire gasps] Look here. Jack said you have to deliver the baby. - What? - He talked me through it. - lt's relatively simple. - l can't do this. - Yes, you can. l have water, towels. - l can't deliver this baby. Well, somebody bloody has to! [Claire gasps] [speaking Korean] l was out there for over a week, days l can't remember. l mean, what if they did something to the baby? God, l'm not ready for this. l'm not... l'm so scared. - l'm scared. - [Kate] Hey. l'm... l'm scared too. But we're gonna get through this together. [Kate] OK? Come on, Boone. lt's not working. The blood's not the problem. lt's the leg. All the blood's pooling there, compartment syndrome. He didn't get this injury from a fall. Something crushed his leg. - What are you doing? - You've given him enough. Hurley. Whoa. Dude. You all right, man? - You're looking kinda goth. - Look, where's Michael? - The beach, l think. - l need you to go get him for me. - What for? - Just get him. Hey, kiddo. - Hey. - How's the water? Oh, it's fantastic. Screaming kid next to me in first class. How does that happen? What you got there? Oh, Sarah wants us to write our own vows. ''My heart skips beats at the sound of your voice, my skin warms to the touch of your fingers. Where you go, l will go...'' Et cetera, et cetera. This is very nice. Those aren't my vows. Those are hers. l stole them out of the room. - l can't write mine. - You're a doctor. - You're not a writer. - Right. Right. Sarah is a beautiful girl. Hell yeah, she is. You love her? Absolutely. Then why are you sitting out here? What if l can't be the husband or the father that l wanna be? What if l asked her because... ...because l saved her life? Should l marry her, Dad? Commitment. lt's what makes you tick, Jack. The problem is, you're just not good at letting go. - [Michael] Locke lied? - [Jack] He didn't fall. His leg was pinned under something heavy. OK, Jack, wait. The cargo container? We gotta do this? - What about the ax? - l can't use the ax. [Sun] What are you doing? His right leg is filling with blood. lf l don't stop it, l won't be able to save him. - You don't mean the... - The leg is dead. There's no other choice. [Kate] Claire? l think this is the time you're supposed to push. So... push. And... Don't hold your breath. You're not gonna be able to push... Claire? What are you doing? Oh, no. You need to push right now. Don't do this, OK? You can't stop this. This is happening. Your baby is coming, and l need your help. - lt's not gonna want me. - What? lt knows l don't want it and l was gonna give it away. Babies know that stuff. Do you want this baby now? Do you want it to be healthy and safe? OK. Then the baby knows that too. You're not alone in this. We are all here for you. This baby is all of ours. But l need you to push. OK? OK? OK. On the count of three. Ready? One... two... three. Push. Go ahead. That's good. Push. [Kate] Good. - [Kate] Yeah, that's good. Push! - [Charlie] Yeah. Right. OK. [coughs] [Sun] Jack. [Boone wheezing] - Let's go. - Jack. - On three. One. - [Sun] Jack. - Two. Three. - Why are you doing this? He's bleeding inside. You're not helping him. You can't save him, Jack. You just can't. Don't tell me what l can't do! [Jack] OK. One, two, three, go. [Michael grunts] Ja... You don't need to see this. You need me, just shout. [raspy breathing] [door scraping] [Sarah] ...in sickness, in health. ln good times and bad. l risk it all, because l love you. Thank you, Sarah. Jack has also prepared his vows. Jack, if you would, please. Jack? l didn't write any vows. l've been trying to for a month, but... l couldn't, and... So l started to wonder why that was. And as time went on, it only got worse. Because, um... Because l'm not good at letting go. Or maybe l'm afraid of what will happen if l fail. But l know one thing. l would have never been able to write anything as beautiful as what you said. And last night, when you were talking about the accident, you got it all wrong. l didn't fix you. You fixed me. l love you, Sarah... ...and l always will. [applause, cheering] [Boone] Wait. Wait. l have to. - lf l don't... - l'm all mashed up inside. You know it. This is our best chance. There's no chance. Really. l mean, look where we are. l'm not gonna let you give up. l know you made... ...a promise. l'm letting you off the hook. Let me go, Jack. l'm sorry. Don't be. Relax, relax. Breathe. Come on. Breathe. Breathe. OK. Good. OK, ready? You've gotta do a nice one. l can see it's close. Go, go. Push! [Kate] That's good. l think it's close. Come on. That's it. OK. Good, good, good. l can see the top of its head. You're almost there. Come on. l can see it. OK. You're almost there. You're so close. Ready? Ready? Come on. One more. Go! Push! Push! Push! Push! Push! - [Claire screams] - Good! Come on! Oh, my God, you have a little boy. A little baby boy. - [baby crying] - Oh, come here. Oh! Oh... That's your baby boy. [Claire sobbing] l have a son. l have a son. [Charlie, Jin laugh] Shh... [wheezing] Tell Shannon... Tell Shannon... Tell her l... [no audible dialogue] lt's a beautiful, healthy baby. Wanna talk about it? Talk about what? Boone died, Jack. He didn't die. - He was murdered. - What?
