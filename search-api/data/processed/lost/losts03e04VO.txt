- Patience, Jack. Patience. - Danny, wait. - Hold up. Be careful out there. See these rocks here? You're gonna chop 'em loose, and you're gonna haul 'em outta here. I am not the enemy. We are not the enemy. If you shoot me... that's exactly what we'll become. You've... You've got a problem with your roof. What ? Maybe you should move on the beach, just for the night. Then I can fix it and, make some improvments. That is really nice of you to offer but, Aaron just fell asleep, so I should probably just... I'll deal with it. I promise. What are you doing, brother ? I was just offering to fix this roof here. Roof ? Fine. If there a problem, i'll fix it. I'm quite handy. I was building a church before... Eko explode it. Right, well... Just trying to help. Thanks. What was all that about ? I don't know. We gonna have together another button push. How are you doing today, Jack ? Great. You seem frustrated. We going to keep watching cartoons, or... are you gonna tell me why I'm here. I hope you like blueberry. - If not I can... - Should I talk to Benjamin ? - Sorry ? - Should i talk to Benjamin ? Because I'm sorry to think that you're just the person who brings me my food. You can talk to him all you want, but he won't tell you anything. - You work for him. - No, I don't work for him. He's in charge. It doesn't work that way over here, Jack. We make decisions together. Really? Because when I was holding that broken plate at your neck, he seemed happy to just let you die. I mean, it felt like he made that decision on his own. You don't know what you're talking about. I don't answer to him. Juliet, I need you. Can it wait? The sub is back. We have a situation, so come with me now. Time for work. Soundin' a little stuffy there, Chinatown. Need to blow your nose? - Just give me an excuse. - Thought I just did. What I gotta do, talk about your mother? Danny, are you there? Yeah. Hold on. Okay, go. What? - Where are they? - They're back in the... This is bad, Juliet. Keep her steady. She'll be okay? What happened? We happened. What? I've been on this rock long enough to realize they ain't in the business of shootin' each other. We did it. Our team. You smiling? Damn right I'm smiling. 'Cause we just got our ticket outta here. Transcript : www.sadgeezer.com Sync : www.sub-way.fr (V.0.90) 3x04 - Every Man For Himself What are you doin'? Whenever you're ready to fill me in. Shush up. I'm thinking. Warning. Reward. Reward. You know that chick they brought in on a stretcher? That's broken nose man's girl. They call him Pickett. Well, Pickett is distracted at the moment. So? Watch and learn, little lady. Warning. Warning. There's juice pumpin' into this box from somewhere. Next time someone comes to pull me out, I'm gonna wait till they step in my little swimming hole, then I grab 'em. Zap. They fall back from the shock, I snag the keys. Bet the bears never thought of that. You're both gonna get electrocuted. Yeah, but I felt the jolt. I can take it. The other guy, he ain't gonna be ready for it. What, you think I'm crazy? No, I'm actually impressed. Well, wipe the stars out of your eyes, sweetheart, 'cause we're gonna do this. So what about Jack? What about him? We don't even know if he's here. Hell, we don't even know if he's alive. We gotta take care of us. It's every man for himself, Freckles. All right, Ford, that's enough. All inmates are required to report to your cells for mandatory...</i> Problem is, I was following your hands, not your eyes. Problem is, you old and dumb. Where did you hide it?! Who's the punching bag? Just got here. Name is Munson. Rumor has it he ripped off the government for 10 mil, but they never found the money. I'll be damned. If your buddy the warden didn't keep breaking up the fights, Munson would be a dead man. That son of a bitch. You get little mints on your pillow at night, too? - Sorry? - You been here, what, a week, and you're on tote bag duty? I've been here nine months. I'm still pushing trash. Well, what does that mean? You think the warden's breakin' up those fights 'cause you're cute, Costanza? He's makin' a play for that 10 mil. First step, butter you up. Give you a plum job. Step two, the warden will reach out to your wife, use her against you. Textbook con. And you're telling me this out of the kindness... - of your... - The advice is free, Murgatroyd. Past nine months, that warden's made my life a living hell. He gets that 10 mil you ain't got, I just might have to kill myself. Well, howdy, warden. He bothering you, Munson? So what brings you to the sewing shop, Boss? Don't think I can't extend your stay, Ford. All it takes is one call. One call. How about you get that trash? oh, yeah. It's the big Kahuna. - Lunch already? - What do you weigh? - What? - What do you weigh? 180, give or take. How old are you? - 32. - Don't lie. 35. Good. Sayonara, sucker. What did you do? We turned it off. ...two days since the sky turned purple, we've been blind, our coms are all down and I can't get 'em back up again, and in case you forgot, - Colleen's in critical... - Juliet's taking care of her. Where am I? What the hell are you doin' to me? Let me out! Jason. Let me out ! Bite down on this, please. You bite down on it. It's for the pain. What?! Wait! Let me out now! I hate needles. No! What are you doing? Hey! What are you doing?! What the hell are you doing?! No, you have to go through the sternum. The sternum. - Like in the movies. - I know, I know. - One... - What are you doing?! Two... Wait! Don't mind me, brother. I'm just gonna take one of your clubs. Hurley said it'd be all right. Hurley, huh? Must mean you're off to save the day. So... I can take one of these? Take the 5-iron. I never use it. That way, when you die in the jungle doing whatever you're doing, I don't have to go looking for it. Thanks, mate. You know, you might want to square your shoulders a bit more. - You play golf? - I'm scottish. Cheers. What the hell? Hey, come on. Hey, move. Let's move. Hey, come on, come on, come on! - What are you doing? - Come on. Come on, Let's move it, let's move it. What's your problem? Did you just kill that bunny? You know what a pacemaker is? What? They stick 'em in the tickers of people who've had bypass work, whose hearts need just a little jump, a kick start. The rabbit had a small pacemaker set to deliver its kick start, should it get too excited... or anxious or frightened... or should it try to escape. Assuming that you were telling the truth about your age and weight, your resting heart rate should be about 70 beats per minute. Your active heart rate, however, that would be about 140. Which is the point at which your pacemaker... will cause your heart to explode. Which is how I know that you're gonna start behaving now. The watch monitors your pulse. If you get within 15 beats of your danger zone, it'll start to beep. If and when it beeps, you're gonna want to relax yourself. Do some deep breathing, some yoga. If you want me dead, why don't you just shoot me and get it over with? Because we're not killers, James. Oh, and one other thing. - Kate. - You touch her, I swear... You tell her what we did, what we put in you, that we're watching you, you tell her any of these things, we'll put one in her, too. Sawyer, are you okay? That's so you can clean yourselves up. And, Kate, if any of that doesn't fit, you just give me a holler, okay? What happened? What did they do to you? Nothing. They just asked me questions. Ain't important. Talk to me. What happened? Look, I told you, nothing happened. So quit asking me. Turn around. What's that? Just my watch. It's busted. - When did you get a watch? - Look, I don't tell you everything! Just leave me alone, damn it. Put some clothes on. Hello, Sawyer. It's James Ford, and I know you know that, 'cause you got it right when you pressed charges. You're mad at me? Well, look where I am. What did you want me to do? You conned me. Something you want? Yeah. Yeah. There is. Come on. I got license plates to make. What's this? This is your daughter. What do you want? Well, first I wanted you to know. Then what? Think I'm gonna take one look at this picture and turn into "father knows best"? We're living in this little place in Albuquerque. It's near the university. - Why are you telling me this? - I just... thought you could write her a letter. Her name's Clementine. What the hell am I gonna write? "Dear goo-goo ga-ga"? She's a baby. She ain't mine. Sawyer, she... I ain't got no daughter. I've been checking out my cage, and I think if I climb to the top, I can squeeze through those bars. They're spaced farther apart up there. Don't bother. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about being smart. I think we should just chill out here a while, get the lay of the land. ...under control. Yeah? You know what he's doing to Karl?</i> You know what he's doing? - What did you do to Sawyer? - Nothing. I heard him yelling, you've got blood on your clothes. - What did you do to him?! - It's not his blood. Then whose blood is it? It's the bod of a woman who's dying. I need your help. it's Jack! Have you lost your mind? - You bring him here? - He's a doctor. He can help. - Well, this is not why... - Do you want her to die? Come on. - What happened? - Gunshot wound to the abdomen. Those aren't hers. Come on. - What's he doing in here? - Danny, he's here to help. Tell him who did this. He ought to know that. - I need him out of here. - Danny, get out. Go. - No way! She's my wife! - Danny, they got it. I got the bullet out, but she's still bleeding. Right upper quadrant. It's flowing badly. - No, no, I padded it. - I need you to clamp under the liver so I can get a look back there. I'm not a surgeon. I know, but I need you to do this. Here. She's got a retrohepatic caval bleed. It's, uh, behind the liver. That's why you missed it. I need lap pads, as many as you've got. All right. Another one. A crash cart. Now. - Juliet, I need paddles. - It's broken. We haven't had, Jack, we haven't had anything happen before. We didn't-we- I don't... Time of death is... She's gone. Take it easy. - Take it easy! - Shut up! You love this guy? What? - I said, do you love him? - Stop! - Do you love him?! - Leave him alone! - Do you love him?! - What are you doing? Stop! Do... you... love... him? Yes, I love him! I love him. I love him. Please. Lock him up! I need to talk to you. Sorry, I'm busy. It's important. Please. You were right. I loved her. And I thought... I really thought she... 10 mil's a lot of greenbacks, killer. Tends to change things. That's why you never get attached, 'cause once you care, that's when they can come at you. Well, what did yours want? I saw you the other day with... with a woman. What did she want? Somethin' I ain't got. That all? You had yourself a good cry. Mind if I go back and see if George gets his farm? I need you to move it... the money. The money you didn't steal? We both know I did. Lila's hired a P.I. She's gonna find it. Do this for me. You have to. It's too dangerous. I'll be a walking target. If you don't help me, the Warden'll get it all. He'll win. Please. Are you okay? Dandy. Guy hits like a girl. No offense. Why did he do that? Hell if I know. These people ever make any sense to you? What are you doing? - What are you doing? - What does it look like? Hang on a second, freckles. I told you the time ain't right. You're the one that said we had to go. - Well, that was before... - Before what? I don't know what they did to you, but I know you're scared enough to lie about it, and that scares me more than anything that they have done to us before. Wait. - What are you doing? - Getting you out of here. - Don't. - I'm not leaving you, Sawyer. - I can get it open. - You're already out. You gotta go. You gotta leave me! - What? - Run. - What did they do to you? - You go! What is that thing? Run. Just go. - It's every man for himself. - Why didn't you fight back?! Tell me the truth for once in your life! If you really love me... Go. I only said that so he'd stop hitting you. Run. Hurry! What the hell are you doing? Damnit, Frackles, don't ! Every man for itself ! Live together, die alone. You know Danny wants to kill him. Danny can wait. Should I bring Shephard back? I want him to sit with her for a while longer. I'm sorry that they... they had to put handcuffs on you. I'm a fertility doctor. I'm not used to death. What was her name? Col. Short for Colleen. I shouldn't-have, I should've come to get you sooner. It wouldn't have mattered. There wasn't any more that you could have done. She was... She was dead before you put her on the table. Are you... are you just saying that to make me feel better? I don't... I don't care about making you feel better. I'm gonna take you back now. I'm sorry for bringing you here. Whose x-rays are those, outside? Those are spinal x-rays, and they belong to a man about 40 years old. And whoever he is, he has a very large tumor on his I-4 vertebrae. And I just happen to be a spinal surgeon. So you tell me, Juliet, who am I here to save? Is that... art? No, just an experiment. - Do you want some fruit salad? - Thanks. I'm not hungry. You might want to wait a minute. Why's that? Good morning. Let's go for a walk. I have to be honest, Ford. When they first brought you here, I thought you were nothing more than a dumb hick. Now I know better. You're a dumb hick that knows how to steal. Can we just get this over with? Yeah, let's. You remember agent Freedman from the treasury department? So, what do you got? The $10 million's in a red Bronco parked in a store-it-quick facility in Sawgrass, right off 441. Unit 23-C. That's where your money is. As agreed, the last six years of your sentence have been commuted. As soon as the truck is recovered and the funds confirmed, your commission will be processed. Now how would you like that? I wanna set up a new account, don't matter what bank. Just make it in Albuquerque. Put it in the name of Clementine Phillips. Okay. Clementine Phillips. And I want it so there's no way she can ever find out who the money's from. Who's Clementine Phillips? We done? Congratulations, Ford. You just lied and cheated your way out of prison. You're a free man. Not much further, James. Just to the top of the next rise. What's up there? Something I want you to see. "Is it that little place you've always wanted, George?" Sorry? What, don't you read? It's from "of mice and men." You'd like it. Puppies get killed. You bring me up here to kill me? Make that thing you put inside me blow up my damn heart? Your heart's not gonna blow up, James. The only thing we put inside you was doubt. Oh, the watch is a heart rate monitor, but nothing more. Look. We gave him a sedative, not a pacemaker. How do I know that's the same bunny? That you didn't just paint an "8" on another one? You don't. You son of a bitch. The rabbit wasn't the thing I wanted to show you. What the... You ever been to Alcatraz? Take the tour? Right now you're standing on a small island roughly twice the size of alcatraz. And that over there, that's your island, the one you've come to know and love. i just wanted you to know, there's nowhere to run. You did all this just to... Just to keep me in a damn cage? We did all this because the only way to gain a con man's respect is to con him. You're pretty good, "Sawyer." We're a lot better. Funny thing is, us telling you about the pacemaker wasn't what kept you in line. It was when i threatened her. You work so hard to make her think you don't care, that you don't need her, but... "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody." "It don't make no difference who the guy is, as long as he's with you." "I tell you... "I tell you a guy gets too lonely and he gets sick." - What the hell are you talking about? - It's from "of mice and men."
