Where did you hear that? The phone rang. I picked it up. A voice kept repeating, "code 14-j." We need to get to the other house. It's easier to fortify, And we'll have better position on the tree lines. What are you talking about? They're here. Hello. No, no, no, no. wait. Wait. I can explain. d-do you speak english? Sure. sure. Ah. okay. Okay. okay. Okay. This... Surrender! surrender! Oh, so you do speak english. Yah! Let me guess. "14-j" ain't the code for the pizza boy. It's an early warning system. Warning for what? somebody tripped The panic switch at our security fence. That means one of my people's been captured. How long did you guys debate amongst yourselves Whether or not to ask me why the phone rang? Five minutes. Well, so much for our head start. Hold up. if we're hunkerin' down, I gotta grab frenchie and the kids. don't bother. they're safe. I sent rousseau, alex and karl away yesterday. away where? Whatever. claire's still sleepin'.

Because the people that are coming won't risk hurting me. You want to live? I'm your best chance. His throat was slit. Know anything about that? No. uh, he was fine when I last saw him. Which was when? When? "when" is kind of a relative term. We don't know anything about this. Any luck fixing the sat-phone? Uh, yeah. sorry, no. The, uh, mike was... smashed pretty good. Best-case scenario, We'd only be able to broadcast tone squelch--beeps and boops. well, yeah, But you could still use it as sort of a telegraph, right? If I had some strips of ferrous metal, Uh, a 9-volt battery clip And some... wiring. We got a bunch of stuff that we salvaged from the plane. great. I'll show you where it is. Bernard, you got a second? These people who are coming-- You're scared of 'em, aren't you? that's right, john. I am. What's going on? Get away from the window, hugo.

October 24th, sir. 2005? Yes, sir. 2005. Thank you. ...Sayid Jarrah... ...sayid jarrah... ...Sayid Jarrah... ...sayid jarrah... Please. I just want to bury my wife in peace. Right now I need you to tell me what's going on. I think the technical term is "shock and awe." They're trying to frighten me into surrendering. Well, why did they stop shooting? Was that claire's house? claire was there. Hugo, get the baby away from the window. Put him in the back room. You said I need to survive this. why? Because there's only one person that can help us now, And that's jacob, and we have to go to him together. What makes you think I can find him? I-i don't even know where the cabin is. I know, but hurley does. Claire£¡ Claire! Claire Claire! Claire Claire! Claire Claire! Are you okay? Claire Charlie? Okay. okay. okay. where's aaron? where's aaron? He's with us. it's okay. we're gonna move now. Let's go. Open the front door! Hugo, you don't want to do that. Open the damn door! Open the door! Open the damn door! Careful. Is she all right? She got her bell rung, but she's gonna be all right. They just started shooting. why? Why slaughter people without even telling us what they want? Those people were murdered to make you angry, james. So you'd be more likely to come storming in here And throw me to the wolves. yeah, what's wrong with that? Sounds like a great plan to me. what do you say, on three? I wouldn't if I were you. Shut up! Miles? Miles? Who the hell let you out? The people who gave me this. They want to talk. You vultures, you followed me to tikrit... to spy on me?! What are you doing here? I'm here to find the man who murdered your wife. How did you get here? I came across the syrian border. It's really not as difficult as you might-- how did you get off the Island? Your friend desmond had a boat. Remember? "the elizabeth." I followed a heading to fiji. Then I chartered a plane. Why now? You remember the name charles widmore, don't you? The man who tried to convince the world That your plane was on the bottom of the ocean? What does it have to do with me? with nadia? There was a man at her procession. He goes by the name of ishmael bakir. He's one of widmore's men. Bakir was last seen five days ago In los angeles, Caught by a traffic camera, Speeding away from the corner of la brea and santa monica. That's three blocks from where nadia was killed. Why would these people want to murder her? I don't know. But they did. How many of 'em are there? Maybe six. I'm not sure. The hell you mean, you ain't sure? You came over on the same boat with 'em, didn't ya? They told me they were just security. Security for what? for him. Once they got him, to escort him back to the mainland. Well, miles, sounds like You're not gonna collect your $3.2 million. Just take it. Why would I talk to them? Because they have a hostage. Well, then they've badly miscalculated, Cause every single one of my people Is prepared to die in service to this island. it's your daughter! Hello? Am I speaking to benjamin linus? That's right. My name is martin keamy. I'm an employee of charles widmore. Who's charles widmore? later. I'd like you to go look out your east window So we can talk about this face-to-face. To the left. You see me? Yeah, I see you. All right, mr. linus, these are my terms. You're gonna step out the front door, Put your hands above your head, And you're gonna walk straight to me. Once I have you in my custody, then I promise you That no one else in that house will be harmed. You and I both know that once you have me, There's nothing to stop you From killing everybody else on this island. What kind of guy do you think I am? Martin christopher keamy Martin christopher keamy-- Former first sergeant, united states marine corps, Served with distinction from 1996 to 2001, But since then, You've worked with a number of mercenary organizations, Specifically in uganda. So I know exactly what kind of man you are, mr. keamy, And we can dispense with the formalities. Okay, ben. you got it. Get down. Get your ass out here right now... Or I'm gonna kill your daughter. I'd like to present a counterproposal. I'm listening. You and your friends... You turn around. Walk back to your helicopter. You fly away and forget you ever heard of this island. Tell your daddy good-bye. Dad... They're serious. They killed karl and my mother. Alex... Alex... I have this under control. Everything's gonna be okay. Please, daddy! Please. Please. You have ten seconds, Ben. Okay, listen. Nine... She's not my daughter. Eight... I stole her as a baby from an insane woman. She's a pawn, nothing more. She means nothing to me. I'm not coming out of this house. So if you want to kill her, go ahead and do it-- I don't see 'em. They just left her body there and disappeared into the jungle. They won't be gone for long. It's gonna be dark in about 20 minutes, And then they're gonna come for him. Then let's just hand him over. I don't think these people have any intentions Of letting us walk of here alive, James, No matter what we do. Well, I ain't got no intention of dyin'. He changed the rules. What? who? What rules? You know I'm right. Our best chance here is to toss him out and fend for ourselves. Hey! Where you goin'? Open this damn door! Open up! Walk. Who are you and why are you following me? My name is Benjamin Linus. And I need you to take a message to Mr. Widmore for me. And what message is that? That should do it. Wait. Where do you think you're going? We're finished here, Sayid. Turn around and walk away. Mourn your loss. get on with your life. I have no life. they took it from me. Go home, sayid. Once you let your grief become anger, It will never go away. I speak from experience. This is my war. It's not yours. I spent the last eight years of my life Searching for the woman I love. I finally found her and I married her. And I buried her yesterday. So don't tell me this is not my war. Benjamin... Benjamin... Who's next? I'll be in touch. Open the damn door! Son of a bitch just left us here. Open the damn door! what's going on? Claire? Claire? You all right, sweetheart? yeah, a bit wobbly, but, uh, I'll live. Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that. Excuse me, James. Excuse you? What were you doing in there? Okay, listen to me very carefully. I need all of you to do exactly as I say. In a minute, we have to run from this house as fast as we can. At that moment, when I give the order, I want you to head Straight for the tree line. You mean towards the guys with guns? No, we want to be as far away from them as possible. Okay, outside. outside now! What did you do?! Did you just call that thing? Fall back! Go! go, go! Head for the trees. I'll catch up with you. Hey, where are you going? I have to say good-bye to my daughter, John. I can't believe it. Might actually have a signal. What are you sending? "what..." "happened... "to... The... doctor?" Okay. they didn't exactly say what happened to the doctor, But your friends are fine, And the helicopter's coming back in--in the morning. Well? He's lying. What the message said was, "what are you talking about? The doctor is fine." You know morse code. What does that mean-- "the doctor is fine"? I don't know. Why are you lying? Why did you say That the helicopters are coming back? Jack Jack. Were you ever... gonna take us off this island? No. No. -Jack. -No. I think your chopper buddies ran that way, If you wanna catch up. Yeah, I think I'll stay with you guys for--for now. Sorry about your daughter. Thank you, John. That being said, you lied to me. You told me you didn't know what the smoke monster was. You can ask Jacob all about it when we go to the cabin. Hang on. "Jacob"? Who the hell's Jacob? He's the man that's gonna tell us what to do next, James. You know what? I'm done with all this. I never should have followed you wackos in the first place. I'm goin' back to the beach, and Claire and the kid Are comin' with me. you good with that? Yeah, I'm good with that. I'm coming with you. Let's go. You, too, Hurley. Have you lost your mind? Hugo stays with us. -Not a chance. -Wait. Leave me out of this. I'm sorry, Hugo. we need you to find the cabin. He ain't goin' anywhere with you, -You crazy son of a bitch. -Stop! put the guns down. I'll go with Locke. -Hugo. -It's okay, Sawyer. Please, put your gun down. You, too. You don't have to do this. You guys go back to the beach. I'll catch up sooner or later. You harm so much as one hair on his curly head... I'll kill you. Fair enough. Let's go. Go. Move. Which way? Thank you. Good evening, Sir. May I help you? Oh, yes. I'm here to see Mr. and Mrs. Kendrick in 4e. At this hour, sir? They're expecting me. Feel free to call up. No need, sir. Good night, sir. Wake up, Charles. I wondered when you were gonna show up. I see you've been getting more sun. Iraq is lovely this time of year. When did you start sleeping with a bottle of scotch by the bed? When the nightmares started. Have you come here to kill me, Benjamin? We both know I can't do that. Then why are you here? I'm here, Charles, Because you murdered my daughter. Don't stand there, looking at me With those horrible eyes of yours And lay the blame for the death of that poor girl on me When we both know very well I didn't murder her at all, Benjamin. You did. No, that's not true. Yes, Benjamin, it is. You creep into my bedroom in the dead of night like a rat And have the audacity to pretend that you're the victim? I know who you are, boy... What you are. I know that everything you have you took from me. So... once again I ask you, Why are you here? I'm here, Charles, To tell you that I'm going to kill your daughter. Penelope, is it? And once she's gone... Once she's dead... Then you'll understand how I feel. And you'll wish you hadn't changed the rules. You'll never find her. That island's mine, Benjamin. It always was. It will be again. But you'll never find it.
