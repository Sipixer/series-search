I know where it is. Why do you fly directly into the thunderhead? Why don't you just sit back and let me do my job? Is that Penelope? She told Charlie she didn't know about this boat, correct? What do you expect to find when you get there? Answers. Damn it! Hold on! On your sodding feet! Move, move! What are you waiting for, Hume? What's the matter, Hume? Did you not hear me? I'm sorry, sir. I was having a dream, sir. You were having a dream? And what were you dreaming about that it took you so sodding long to get to your mark? I was in a helicopter, sir. And there was a storm, sir. I don't remember the rest, sir. Well, at least it was a bloody military dream. Right! All of ya! In the yard! Four minutes! And you can thank private Hume for having to do it in double-time. Move! - One, two, three! - Three! - One, two, three! - Four! - One, two, three! - Five! 100 crunches! I hope your dream was worth this, mate. Sorry, pal. It's just... I've never had a dream that was so vivid. - It was like I was actually there. - Have you got something to say, Hume? I asked you a question! We're almost through it. I see daylight. What do you think you're doing? Desmond, are you all right? Who are you? How do you know my name? Here you go. All right, they took off a day ago. - Why haven't we heard from 'em? - I'm gonna tell you again, as I've been telling you all night, I don't know! You heard the same thing as I did when we called the boat. - What makes you think I know anything? - Because you're not worried. - Excuse me? - Your boat's 40 miles off the coast. It should've taken 'em, what... 20 minutes to get there? So why aren't you worried? Should I wring my hands together and whisper a prayer on their behalf? Come on. Maybe we should just... tell 'em. - Tell us what? Let's not confuse anyone. Well... Daniel, maybe if you talk real slow, we'll be able to follow. Your perception of how long your friends have been gone... It's not necessarily how long they've actually been gone. - What does that mean? - This is a mistake. It'll be fine. It'll be fine. As long as Frank flew on the bearings I gave him, if he stayed on it, it... - It'll be fine. - And what if he didn't? Then there might be side effects. - We're at 2,000 feet. Sit down! - What am I doing here? - What is it? - It's Des... - You know me? - Hold him down! - I'm trying! - Let go of me! Keep him away from the stick! We'll be there in two minutes! - What are you doing back? - Who are they? Survivors of 815. So you brought them here. What the hell were you thinking? - Where am I? - Easy, buddy. Who are you people? What am I doing here? - My friend is disoriented. - I'm not your friend! I don't know you! I don't know you! - When did he start doing this? - He was fine when we left. And we hit some weather. Faraday told me as long as I stayed on the vector... Wait. What's your name, my friend? OK, Sayid. We're gonna take your buddy down to the sick bay. I'm going with him. Let our doctor look at him first, then you can come down. You got my word on that, OK? All right. Listen to me. This is a mistake, right? - I don't know these people. - I understand. No, but this is wrong! I'm not supposed to be here! Twenty! Twenty-one! - 22! - "Here"? - 23! - "Here" what? What the hell are you doing on your feet? Are you finished with your crunches because you want to run? Right! Squad! On your feet! Right face! 10 kilometers! Get moving, or so help me, I'll kill you myself. What the hell's the matter with you, Des? If I told you, you'd think I was crazy. I already know you're crazy. This morning, when I was in the yard doing crunches... I left. What do you mean, you left? I was on a boat. And then I was back here, right where I started. Des, if you're trying to get tossed out of service... Billy, I am telling you the truth, man. Who else was on this... boat? Anyone you recognize? There was a photo. - Penny was in the photo. - What? Des, where you going? Thanks for this morning, Hume! Watch your step. Watch it. Watch your step. Take it easy. I'm not here. This... This isn't happening. You are here, and this is happening. - Look, we'll take care of you. - What am I doing here? - You're gonna be OK. - I'm not supposed to be here. Who are you people? My name is Keamy, and this is Omar. I'm from Vegas, and he's from Florida. - But as for where we are... - We last ported in Fiji. So at least we know we're still in the Pacific. All right, my friend. Now you just relax, OK? We're gonna go get the doc, and he's gonna ask you some questions to help us sort all this out. What do you mean, sort out? Wait! I'm not supposed to be here! I'm not supposed to be here! Open this door! Open this door! It's happening to you too? Isn't it? soustitreslost@gmail.com What's happening to Des? Your friends know what's wrong. They didn't tell me. Can you share how we took off at dusk and landed in the middle of the day? Listen, I don't know what's happening to your buddy, all right? But you gotta trust me when I tell you I'm trying to help you. You want to help me? Give me your phone. Let me call my people. You give me that weapon, and I'll give you this phone. Be quick. Don't go trying to call Baghdad. Those phones only call each other. Jack? It's Sayid. - I'm on the freighter. - Are you OK? Where have you been? Something happened during the flight, and now Desmond's in their sick bay. Hold on, hold on. All right, you're on speaker. On the helicopter, something happened to Desmond.</i> He doesn't appear to recognize me or know where he is. "Side effects"? Wait, your friend Desmond, has he... Has he recently been exposed to high levels of radiation or electromagnetism? Okay, look, we don't know why, but going to and coming from the island, some people can get a little... Confused. So... What? This is amnesia? No, this is not amnesia. Can you hear me? Are you all right? I was just on a ferris wheel. See, Ray? I'm not crazy. It's happening to him, too, Ray, and it's gonna happen to you. It's gonna happen to all of us, everyone... Once we start heading to that island again. Would you please step aside? - I need you to relax for a minute. - No! No, it's not gonna stop it, Ray! Nothing can stop it, Ray! - And how are you feeling? - What the bloody hell is going on? - I understand you're disoriented. - You won't stick me with that! I don't wanna stick you with anything. It's okay. I just wanna check your eyes. Why? So I can help you. What's your name? Tell me about the last thing you rem... What do you want, Desmond? Penny, listen. I'm... I'm in trouble, and... But I... I think something's happening to me, and... I'm confused and... I need to see you. You broke off with me, and then you joined the army,</i> and now you call with some expectation that I still care about you?</i> Yeah, I'd say you are confused. No, I'm not. It's... Look, I've got two days leave starting tonight. Can I come and see you? No, and don't bother showing up at the flat either, 'cause I've moved.</i> Moved? Where? It doesn't matter. Look, Desmond, I'm gonna go. - Please, just don't call me again. - No, no. Listen! Penny... Penny, I need you! Did you just... Experience something, Desmond? What the hell? You're not supposed to be here, and definitely not with him. Faraday called from the island. He needs to talk to the Scottish guy. No, Faraday won't talk to my patient. Get out! But he's not your patient. Give Desmond the phone. Give him the phone now! Desmond? My name is Daniel Faraday. We met yesterday before you took off, but I guess you don't remember that. - Am I right? - Took off? What? We don't have long to talk, so I need you to tell me what year you think it is. What do you mean, what year... It's 1996. All right, Desmond, look, you gotta tell me. Where are you? I'm in some kind of sick bay. No, not right now. Where are you supposed to be? Where are you in 1996? I'm at camp Millar. It's a Royal Scots regiment. Just north of Glasgow. - Dan, you might wanna... - Yeah. No. No, I'm thinking. Desmond, listen, when it happens again, I need you to get on a train. Get on a train and go to Oxford university.</i> Queen's college physics department, all right? What? Why? Because I need you to find me. Where is it? - What? - My journal, my journal. I need my journal, or I won't believe him. Why does he think he's in 1996? I don't know. It's unpredictable. It's a random effect. Sometimes the displacement's only two hours, sometimes years. Wait, this has happened before? The phone now, please. Thank you. - Are you still there? - Doc? Are you okay in there? Talk to him! I can't hold them for long. Yes, I'm here! Okay, listen, when you find me at Queen's college, I need you to tell me to set the device to 2.342. - What?<i> - All right, you got it? 2.342.</i> And it must be oscillating at 11 hertz. You got it, Desmond? 2.342, oscillating at eleven... Just remember, 2.342 at eleven hertz, all right?</i> And one more thing, Desmond. If the numbers don't convince me, I need you to tell me that you know about Eloise. Easy, now! Desmond, tell me that you know about Elo...</i> ... not a single piece of original thinking... ... the concept of "original", the opposite of derivative. I am the one for you to impress, Mr. Hollister, and I'm not impressed. So go. Go try again. Sorry, are you Daniel Faraday? - You are? - I'm sorry. I'm Desmond Hume, and I was told I could find you here. And I think I've... just been to the future. The future? I spoke to you there. You told me to come here to Oxford. I had to find you. You said you'd help me. Why didn't I just help you there in the future? - Sorry? - Why would I put you through the headache of time traveling? You now what I mean? It just seems a little... unnecessary? And don't you think my esteemed colleagues could've come up with something just a little more believable? What kind of a prank is that? Time paradox... So uninspired... Set your device to... 2.342 and make sure it oscillates at 11. Okay, now... Now you... You're gonna tell me who told you those numbers. You did. This is ridiculous. I know about Eloise. What is all this? This is where I do the things Oxford frowns upon. All right, this... future version of... me, he referenced this meeting, right? Obviously. So I would remember you coming to Oxford, right? I would remember this here, right now. Actually... no. - No? - Maybe you just forgot. Yeah, right. How would that happen? - So... This is changing the future? - You can't change the future. - What's that for? - Radiation. - Do I get one? - No need. For prolonged exposure. I do this 20 times a day. So what do you put on your head? Yeah. This is... Eloise. What does this do? If the numbers you gave me are correct, what this will do... Is unstick Eloise in time, just like you. - What happened? - Wait. She's not back yet. There she is. Okay, here goes... Everything. That's it... Come on. That's it. It worked! - This is incredible. - How is a rat running through a maze - so incredible? - What is incredible is I just finished the maze this morning, and I'm not gonna teach her how to run it until hour from now. So you sent her to the future. No, her consciousness, her mind. So how does that help me? You? Help? I don't understand. Am I supposed to help you? - Didn't I send you back to help me? - I don't know why you sent me here. All I know about you is you end up on some bloody island. An island? What island? Why would I go to... Give me the phone. Come on, everybody relax! Daniel wanted to talk to the guy, so we brought him the phone, that's all. - You let Faraday talk to him? - He said he could help. Faraday can't even help himself! Outside now. - The captain wants to talk to you. - And I wanna talk to your captain. I'll be sure to let him know. In the meantime, have a seat. - I need to get back. - Back where? The island? He said he could help, he'd tell me what I needed to do. - Can you please explain to me... - Desmond? You're Desmond? Do I know you? I'm George Minkowski. I'm the communications officer. Before they strapped me down here, all the calls to and from this boat came through me in the radio room. And every so often, I'd get this flashing light on my console. An incoming call. We were under strict orders never to answer it. - So? What's that got to do with me? - Those calls came from your girlfriend. Penelope Widmore. - What happened? - You're back. And you were out almost seventy-five minutes. Out? You just... You went catonic right in the middle of a sentence. I had to carry you to the chair. I take it you were in the future again? - For how long? - I don't know. Five minutes? Why does this keep happening? In your case, I'm guessing the progression is exponential. Each time your consciousness jumps, it gets harder and harder to jump back. I'd be careful crossing the street if I were you. - What happened to her? - She died. - I can see that. How? - Brain aneurysm maybe. I don't know. I'm gonna do an autopsy later. - Will it happen to me? - The effects seem to vary from case to case, but... Answer me! If this keeps happening, am I gonna die? I don't know. I think Eloise's brain short-circuited. The jumps between the present and the future... She eventually... She couldn't tell which was which. She had no anchor. - What do you mean, "anchor"? - Something familiar in both times. All this, see? This is all variables. It's random. It's chaotic. Every equation needs stability, something known. It's called a constant. Desmond... You have no constant. When you go to the future, nothing there is familiar. So if you want to stop this then you need to find something there, something that you really really care about... That also exists back here... In 1996. This constant... Can it be a person? Yeah, maybe. But you have to make some kind of contact. Didn't you say you were off on a boat in the middle of nowhere? - Who are you calling? - I'm calling my bloody constant. The number you have dialed has been disconnected.</i> You okay? You look a lot older now, huh? Welcome back, Desmond. - I need to call Penny. - Calling her is not our priority. Listen, brother, I don't know you, but you seem to know me, so... So if you and me are friends, then I need your help. I need to call Penny now. You boys are getting way ahead of yourselves. Two days ago, someone sabotaged all the equipment. We lost all communication with the mainland. I probably could've fixed it, but then... - Then I went nuts. - Where's the radio room? It's one deck up. I'll take you there. Come on. And how do we get out of here? Through the door. Looks like you guys have a friend on this boat. Your nose. It's clear. Let's... The <i>Black Rock</i> set sail from Portsmouth, England, on March 22, 1845, on a trading mission to the Kingdom of Siam when she was tragically lost at sea. The only known artifact of this journey is the journal of the ship's first mate, which was discovered among the artifacts of pirates on <i>Ile Ste Marie</i>, Madagascar, 7 years later. The contents of this journal have never been made public, nor are known to anyone outside the family of the seller, Tovard Hanso. We open the bidding on lot 2-3-4-2 at 150,000 pounds. 150,000, sir.

Just for a minute, all right? Mr. Widmore. - Desmond? - Can I have a word, sir? - Sorry, Mr. Widmore, he... - It's fine. - ... of Charles Dickens when he died. - Walk with me. We open the bidding on this lot... Your word. Let's have it. I need to get in touch with Penny. I don't know how to reach her, and her number's been disconnected. there was a time when if you'd have asked her to marry you, I'm certain she would've said yes. fortunately... your cowardice won out instead. I take it you've had second thoughts. and you'd like her to give you another chance. Why do you hate me so much? It's not me who hates you. Here's her address. I'll let her tell you herself. I know. It's getting harder. It starts happening faster too. Come on, let's move. How did this happen to you? We were anchored here, waiting for our orders, bored out of our minds. Me and Brandon, he's one of the crew members, we took out the ship's tender. We just wanted to see the island. But Brandon started acting crazy, so we had to turn around. - Where is he? - In a body bag. There. Who did this? You got me. but when the captain finds out, I feel sor... After your call, someone has to tell me precisely what is going on. - Can you fix it, brother? - I need a minute. Do you have the number to make the call? Wake up, brother. You gotta come back! Desmond, do you know the number? You'd better remember it. It's 2004. I didn't realize it was almost Christmas. It's been... I can't... get... back. What happened to him? The same thing that's gonna happen to me. - What are you doing here? - I had to... I tried to call you, but you disconnected your phone. Yeah, because I moved. I don't know if you get the signals, but I'm trying to make a clean break from you, so if you don't mind... Pen, please wait. I just need to get your new phone number. - Why would I give you that? - Because I made a huge mistake. I should never have broken up with you, - I know that now, and I'm sorry and... - Don't. Just don't... I understand, and I know it's too late to change things, but I need to tell you something, and I need you to listen to me. I know it's gonna sound ridiculous, but... Please, Pen. I need you to listen to me. Just say what you need to say and then go. I know this doesn't make any sense, because it doesn't make any sense to me, but... eight years from now, I... I need to call you, and I can't call you if I don't have your number. - What? - Penny, just... give me your number. I know I've ruined things, I know you think we are over, but we're not. If there's any part of you that still believes in us, just... Give me your number. - And if you call me tonight? Tomorrow? - I won't call... for eight years. December the 24th, 2004. Christmas Eve. I promise. if I give you the number, will you leave? Aye. 0893. 7946-0893. 7946... All that, and you're not gonna write it down? It wouldn't do any good. Keep that number. You can't change it for 8 years. - Get out! - Just remember, December 24th, 2004. Pen, if you still care about me, You have to answer. I'm not crazy! you have to believe me! You have... to trust me. I do trust you, but you still have to remember that number. 7946... 0893. 7946-0893. - It's a London number. - Excellent timing. The patch is done, but I don't know how long the battery will last. I hope she's there. I hope so, too. Penny, you answered. You answered, Penny. Des, where are you? I'm on a boat. I'm... I've been on an island. My God, is that really you? Yes, it's me! You believed me. You still care about me. I've been looking for you for the past three years. I know about the island. I've been researching... and when I spoke to your friend Charlie...</i> that's when I knew you were still alive.</i> That's when I knew I wasn't crazy. - Des, are you still there? - Yes, I'm here! - Can you hear me? - Yes, it's better. I love you, Penny. I've always loved you. I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you too. - I don't know where I am. - I'll find you. - I promise - No matter what, - I'll come back, promise. - I won't give up, I promise. I love you. I'm sorry. The power source went dead. That's all we have. Thank you, Sayid. It was enough. Are you all right now?
