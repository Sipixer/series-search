- I'm fine. I'm fine. - I'm training. - Training for what? For a race around the world. - Jack. - I'm Desmond. See ya in another life, yeah? Type in exactly what I tell you, you understand? Exactly. Nothin' else. 4... 8... 15... 16... 23... 42... Now press "execute." - What's gonna happen? - Just push it! Kate! Locke! Who the hell is that? Move, and I kill him. Michael! Sawyer! Jin! Others. Others. Others! Others! - Other what? - Others. Where's my boy? Where's my boy? Hey! Hey, what did you do with my boy?! You hear me? Come back here! Do you want him to die? Put it down. Is this what you were talking about, Locke? Is this your destiny? All roads lead here. My mother stole again from me this week. I don't even keep money in my purse anymore. I've been hiding it. But when she wants a drink... she stole $30. I know it may not seem like a lot of money to some of you, but it's a lot to me, and I want it back. Something you want to say? John, you've been coming here for a month now-- I just don't think $30is worth getting angry about. Well, Francine feels like $30-- Francine feels a little too much, you ask me. You all do. I mean, seriously. "So and so never called me back", "my mother stole $30from me." I never even knew who my parents were. Couple years ago, my, uh, my birth mother found me, and, uh, she told me... I was special. And, uh, through her, I met my real father. Great news, right? Well, he pretended to love me just long enough to steal my kidney because he had to have a transplant. And then he dropped me back in the world like a piece of trash, just like he did on the day that I was born. You want your damn $30 back! I want my kidney back. Probably a good idea. You know, if you get kidney cancer, you've only got one. That's funny. I'm sorry if I ruined your meeting. Oh, hell. You just said everything I've always wanted to say in there. Most of the time, I want to stand up and scream, "get over it, freaks." Well, why don't you? Well, I have to keep a cork in. If I get all hot and bothered, there's no stoppin' me. Guess you won't becoming back next week, huh? - No. Not likely. - Hmm. That's too bad. I like bald guys. - Well, I'm not bald. - I can wait. I'm-- I'm Helen... by the way. Hi, Helen. I'm John. Where's Kate? Lower your gun, or I'll blow his damn head off. Where's Kate?! Put it down. I'm not putting down anything. Calm down. It's okay. - Do not move. - No, don't-- - Don't what? - He's unarmed. He just had a gun pointed at your head. Oh, what did you do? What did you do? We're all gonna die. We're all gonna die. I have to fix it. What the hell's he talking about? Listen! If you do not let me up, we are gonna die. Stop moving, or I swear to god... Look at the wall! You see that? That's a timer, and it's countin' down. I've gotta enter the code. I've gotta push the button. Or  what? - Jack, you should let him up. - Don't tell me what to do! Or what? What's gonna happen? Do I know you? You got him? Bastard. What? Nothing, Jack. Hey. What  are you doin'? Where are you going? Nowhere, I... I'm... I just have trouble sleeping in a strange bed. No, it--it has nothing to do with you, Helen. I promise. I really like you. I'm sorry. I'll call you later. Morning. Morning. John, I know you like to drive through my neighborhood. And I know that every now and then you like to park outside my house. Now I thought it might all stop when I moved, but, uh, here you are. Now I admit, at first I thought it was funny. Now it's just annoying. So how about you tell me what the hell it is you want? Why? Excuse me? Why? There is no "why." You think you're the first person that ever got conned? You needed a father figure, and I needed a kidney, and that's what happened. Get over it. And, John, don't come back. You're not wanted. I don't think you need that, Kate. Whatever you're looking for, maybe I can help. Can you fix a computer? Then you can't help me, can you? Sayid can fix a computer. Get him. Go and get Sayid. Can you get back up that rope? I won't have to. There's gotta be a front door in this place. Down the corridor to the left. Be persistent, the wheel sticks. Got ya. Now you're gonna tell me what's goin' on. Jack, we don't have time for th-- - We're taking a time-out. - Please, just let me-- Look, you wanna get to work, you're gonna tell me how you got here. It was three years ago. I was on a solo race around the world, and my boat crashed into the reef, and then Kelvin came. Kelvin? Kelvin. He comes runnin' out the jungle. "Hurry, hurry, come with me." He brings me down here. First thing he does, 'cause it's beepin' already, he types in the code, he pushes the button, and it stops. "What was all that about?" I say. "Just savin' the world," he says. Saving the world? His words, not mine. So I started pushing the button, too. And we saved the world together for awhile, and that was lovely. Then Kelvin died, and now here I am all alone. The end. Don't tell me you believe this. This is crazy. You think that makes sense, pushing a button? You're gonna take his word for it? His word is all we have, Jack. You don't have to take my word for it. Watch the film. What? The bookcase, top shelf, behind "turn of the screw." Projector's in the pantry. Here. Dude, I gotta say, I didn't think we were gonna get through the night. And I wasn't even here for that baby stealing part. I can assure you it was very exciting. It's about time things are finally returning to normalness. Sayid! Aw, crap. Sayid... We need your help. What do you know? What did they do to you? Who the hell are they? Who the hell are they? Others. Did you see Walt? The others-- how many? How many? They had him blindfolded. Blindfolded. Could be a hundred of 'em out there. - Push me up. - What? Boost me up. I'm gonna try to get us outta here. Come  on. Help us out, Chewie. They got it weighted down with something. It's tied off somewhere. Come on. Lift me higher. It's a girl. Wanna tell me what was goin' on down here before I showed up, John? Kate was tied up. Desmond had a gun on me. I think you pretty much caught the gist of it. Desmond. He wanted to know a lot about us-- how we got here, if we were sick. You didn't ask anything about him? He was the one with the gun. You sure seem calm for someone who believes the world's gonna end in the next 45 minutes. He'll fix it. You understand that what he's saying, it's... it's insane. It's impossible. Why is it insane? Because the last time I saw the computer that was gonna save the world, it didn't look like that. Is the reason you're so upset because he said he recognized you? Because that would be impossible. Welcome. I'm Dr. Marvin Candle, and this is the orientation film for station 3 of the Dharma Initiative. In a moment, you'll be given a simple set of instructions for how you and your partner will fulfill the responsibilities associated with this station. But first, a little history. The Dharma Initiative was created in 1970 and is the brainchild of Gerald and Karen Degroot, two doctoral candidates at the university of Michigan. Following in the footsteps of visionaries such as B.F. Skinner-- ...imagined a large-scale communal research compound, where scientists and free thinkers from around the globe could pursue research in meteorology, psychology, parapsychology, zoology, electromagnetism and utopian social-- ...reclusive Danish industrialist and munitions magnate Alvar Hanso, whose financial backing made their dream of a multipurpose... social science research facility a reality. You and your partner are currently located in station 3-- or the swan-- and will be for the next 540 days. Now station 3 was originally constructed as a laboratory where scientists could work to understand the unique electromagnetic fluctuations emanating from this sector of the island. Not long after the experiments began, however, there was... an incident. And since that time, the following protocol has been observed. Every 108 minutes, the button must be pushed. From the moment the alarm sounds, you will have four minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor. ...induction into the program. When the alarm sounds, either you or your partner must input the code. It is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts. In this manner, you will both stay as fresh and alert-- ...utmost importance that when the alarm sounds, the code be entered correctly and in a timely fashion. Now do not attempt to use the computer for any-- Congratulations, until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands. On behalf of the Degroots, Alvar Hanso and all of us at the Dharma Initiative, thank you. Namaste. And... good luck. We're gonna need to watch that again. What's that? It's a present. It's been six months. It's sort of an anniversary, right? - I didn't get you anything. - That's okay. It only cost me a buck. It's to my place. Thought you might be tired of knocking. Well, Helen... I don't know what to say. There's, uh, there's just one condition, though, John. When you stay over, you stay over. What do you mean? I followed you last night, to that house that you go to. Is it your father's house? Why would you follow me, Helen? Why would you do that? Well, you sneak off in the middle of the night. I just needed to know where you were going. I care about you, John. No. Well, yeah, but what I do is my business. It's personal. I wasted 20 years of my life being angry. I told myself I would get over it, but I... I couldn't do it alone. I needed to find help. You helped me, John. And  I can help you. You just have to promise me that you're not gonna go to that place anymore. All right. All right? You're gonna watch that again? Aren't you? No, John, I'm not. Okay, okay, okay. Are you all right, sister? - Who are you? - We crashed here. We were on a plane. Sydney to Los Angeles. What? 40 of us made it. Flight 815? You were on it, too? Wait. You were in the back? It broke off midair. How did you s-- I don't know. I don't know. The plane came apart, and somebody's frickin' hardside came out of the overhead and knocked me out. I woke up underwater and made my way to the top, swam to shore. You've been out here by yourself all this time? Trying to find food, making my way, hoping to find somebody. And then yesterday they found me. - Who are they? - You tell me. Did you see a boy? 10 years old? They took my son. No. I'm sorry. I'm Ana Lucia. Sawyer. This is Mike. The quiet Korean guy's Jin. We're about to be the best thing that ever happened to you. How's that? 'Cause next time Shaft opens the cage, he's gonna get a surprising little howdy doody. Are you in contact with the people that made it? The film. Are you in contact with anyone? Do you think I'd be here if I was? How is it that you didn't know about the crash, about us? I push this button every 108 minutes. I don't get out much. So these replacements... Kelvin died waiting for his replacements. So you don't get out. You don't see anyone. Where does your food come from? You really think this is happening? Why wouldn't it be? It says "quarantine" on the inside of the hatch to keep you down here, keep you scared. But you know what? We've been up there for over 40 days, and no one's gotten sick. You think this is the only part of it that's true? Did you ever think that maybe they put you down here to push a button every hundred minutes just to see if you would-- that all of this-- the computer, the button-- it's just a mind game, an experiment? Every single day. And for all our sakes, I hope it's not real. But the film says this is an electromagnetic station. And I don't know about you, brother, but every time I walk past that concrete wall out there, my fillings hurt. Right. Oh, no. What happened? It's over. What? What do you mean, "it's over"? What-- what are you doing? Are you leaving? Desmond! Wait. We can-- we can fix the computer. Sayid is coming. He knows-- Give him my best. Wait, wait, wait. Where are you-- You can't leave. Where are you going? As far as I can run, brother. - What should we do? - Nothing. We do nothing. It's not real. None of it's real. This isn't-- this isn’t what was supposed to happen! What was supposed to happen? Jack, please, don't leave me here. Good-bye, John. - You're on your own. - Jack. Why is this happening like this? What do you want? What do you-- What am I supposed to do?! Helen, what... Helen, what-- what-- Hey, Helen, wait. Helen! Don't! Helen! Why are you doing this? He's not coming out of his house, John, because he doesn't care. I know why you're here, why you keep coming here. You're scared. You're scared of moving forward-- with me, with us. You're gonna have to choose. Him or me? No. No. No, it's not that simple. Yes, it is. I... I... I can't. I can't. - Yes, you can. - No, I can't! I don't know how. Because you don't know what's gonna happen. None of us do. That's why it's called a leap of faith, John. You don't have to be alone. Jack? Jack! John? Dude. What is this place? John, where's Jack? Jack's gone. I need your help. What does it look like? It's a breaker box. There has to be one. Follow the conduit lines. Cool. Okay, great. What's a conduit line? Those tubes-- follow those. Whoa. Did you find it? Uh... Uh... Depends on what you mean by "it." All right, here's what we're going to do. Jin plays dead. You call for help. Sick prisoner? You serious? What, you got a better idea, sweetheart? Where did you get that gun anyway? What? The gun. How did you get it on the plane? There was a federal marshal on the plane. So what, you just happened to have his gun? Yeah. I'm lucky. Mike... How come you didn't use it when they grabbed you? Gosh, I guess I was too busy getting hit in the face with a club. How come you're suddenly so interested, cupcake? - Hey! - What? Come on, let's just-- we've got to-- Back up! Back up. Coming out. Coming out! What happened? Who are they? Stop. Oh, right. The code, yeah? What? Right, listen carefully. If by some miracle, you manage to get that computer working again, you gotta enter the code-- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Hit "execute." - Again-- 4, 8, 15, 16-- - Shut up! Sorry? Nothing is going to happen. Some man takes you down there, shows you a movie, and you push a button on-- on faith alone. Nothing is going to happen! In about 15 minutes, you're either going to be very right or very wrong, brother. You want to shoot me? Shoot me! But I'm not hanging about. Why are you running? You don't even know what you're running from! I remember you. Running. I know you. - I met you. - Stop. Los Angeles. I was training, yeah? - You twisted your ankle. - Stop. You're a doctor, right? There was this girl. You were worried. You said-- You said you failed her. - That was you! - It doesn't matter. - Was she okay? The girl? - It doesn't matter. - What happened to her? - It doesn't matter. - How can you say it doesn't-- - I married her! Right. And you... you're not married to her anymore then. See you in another life, yeah? Can you fix it? This man, whoever he was, replaced the motherboard. The power transformer is blown. Don't you need to know why? All I need to know is that the timer is counting down to something and that this computer needs to be repaired. I'm sure you'll tell me why once I've done so. Found it! Uh, what's that? - Sayid? - I'm working on it. - You have to-- I know what I have to do. Reconnected the processor... Replaced the transformer... It's on. Okay. So what now? There was a code. He made me enter it. What code? Can you remember what it is? - 4. 8. - Wait a minute. - 15. 16. - Dude, I'm serious. Stop! Hugo, this is not the time or place! Yeah? Well, I think it is. 23... What is this thing? We don't even know what it does! I mean, we need-- 32. You know what? Forget it. Go ahead. Do your thing. It's not 32. It's 42. He just told me-- Desmond. The last number's 42. You're sure? Yeah, I'm sure. You do it, Jack. What? You have to do it. You do it yourself, John. No, you saw the film, Jack. This is a-- this is a 2-person job, at least. This argument is irrelevant. Sayid, don't. Jack-- Don't. It's not real. Look, you want to push the button, you do it yourself. If it's not real, then what are you doing here, Jack? Why did you come back? Why do you find it so hard to believe?! - Why do you find it so easy?! - It's never been easy! Maybe you should just do it. No. It's a button. I can't do this alone, Jack. I don't want to. It's a leap of faith, Jack.
