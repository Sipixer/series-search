See if we can get this thing started, okay? I thought we needed a new carburettor. Well, maybe we don't. Come on. Slide behind the wheel. We'll fire this up. What's the matter? Go ahead. This is stupid. Without a new carburettor, it's not gonna work. Having hope is never stupid. You gotta believe good things will happen, and then they will. Understand what I'm saying? In this world, son, You gotta make your own luck. All right? All right. Come on. Well, what do you want to fix today? We're gonna have to put that on hold for a little while, 'cause I gotta go to Vegas. You know, I got some work out there. - What about the road trip? - The grand canyon will still be there when I get back, little dude. I got something for you. I'm... not supposed to, Mom says. Live a little, Hugo. It's just a candy bar, okay? All right. I'll be back before you know it, all right? Hold down the fort? You're my man? All right. So then the others take the bags of our heads, and we're, like on the other side of the island. And they take Jack, Kate and Sawyer someplace, and they sent me back to warn everyone to stay away... which I did... And now, everyone's freaked out. With them gone, and what happened to Eko, they're all scared. And I'm scared. But then I've... been scared most of my time here, anyway... Except when I'm with you. I miss you, Libby. Bloody hell. Dude, you okay? Peachy. Really? 'Cause you've kinda been moping the last-- Look, it's not worth talking about, Hurley, okay? Dude, you can tell me anything. Desmond... ... said I was gonna die. He told me he has these flashes... visions, whatever... and in them, I always die. So this is the part where you tell me, "It's ridiculous. Don't be daft. He's a nutter." I think he might be right. And I think it might be my fault. Your fault? I'm... kinda cursed. Death finds me, dude. Vincent? Is that an arm? Here, Vincent. Come here. I think we need to get that. Yeah, chase the dog with the skeletal arm into the creepy jungle. You be my guest. If I'm not back in three hours, tell somebody. Awesome. Subtitles: www.swsub.com It's everyone's fantasy, winning the lottery. Untold millions falling into your lap overnight. What would you do with all that money? Well, one such lucky winner recently bought a chicken shack. I'm Tricia Tanaka with Hugo Reyes, Winner of a record $114 million, outside Mr. Cluck's Chicken Shack in Diamond Bar, which will be having its grand reopening tomorrow. So, Hugo, I think the question on everyone's mind is why did you buy Mr. Cluck's? I like chicken. Also with us is Hugo's former boss and now employee, Randy Nations. That's probably every working stiff's fantasy, isn't it, Mr. Reyes? Okay, so, Hugo, tell us what else you've done since you got on your lucky streak. Actually, I've kind of had some bad luck, too. My grandpa Tito died of a heart attack, and the first house I bought my mom burnt down. My friend Johnny ran off with my girlfriend Starla... And this guy jumped off my accountant's roof. Cut! What the hell was that? It's a puff piece, Mr. Reyes. Do you know what that is? Sorry, Tricia Tanaka. Do you mind if we go inside and shoot some b-roll? - I don't know... - Yeah. Of course you can. He's just superstitious. You know, the ribbon isn't cut yet. Okay, let's go. God, I hate this. - I always get the stupid stories. - Hey, you sure it's okay? Yeah, relax. The safety guards are on the fryers? Those fryers are stone-cold. All right? We don't even start cooking till tomorrow. You hear something? And then pan through the... Well, we are out of Dharma oat bars. - Already? - Yep. Did you check behind the powdered milk? - Yeah. It's not there. - You pass me the box of cereal? Then I guess we're out of them. Will you... pass me... the cereal? From now on, I will only speak to you in English. It's how you will learn. It will be hard at first... Hey, everyone! Hurley, what is it? Is it the others? - Are you okay? - What's going on, man? Car. I found a car tipped over in the jungle. You found a... car. And we can totally fix it! And get it going again. It's not far. Come on. Why do we need to start a car? Because it'll be fun. We could all use some fun. I mean, after everything that's happened, we need it. Especially you, dude. So who's with me? Well, I... gotta get some bananas. Sorry. - I don't think so, Hurley. - Sorry, Hurley. Come on! Anyone? We're gonna drive it! Who's coming? Thanks, dude. You have no idea what you volunteered for, do you? Come on. Are we there yet? If we are where I think we are, then our beach should be just through those trees. We'll be home in about five minutes. Try to contain your excitement, Freckles. Forgive me if I'm not excited about explaining why there's only two of us coming back, James. Well, maybe they should explain why they ain't come looking for us. In fact, I'd be surprised if Loc... - What happened? - Stepped on something. - Son of a bitch! - Here, let me see. Looks like a... dart. How the hell did it get out here? Just relax your foot for a second, okay? I'm gonna pull it out on the count of three. You ready? One... I thought you said three. Yeah, well, anticipation's the worst part. I thought I would spare you. You know, all you have to do is say sorry. We could start again, give each other a clean slate. Slate... like on "little house"? What? "Little house on the prairie"? Laura Ingalls used to write on this little chalkboard at school? You call it "little house"? I had mono when I was a kid. I missed two months of school. We only got one channel in my trailer. What are we even talking about? We ain't talking about nothing. And I ain't got nothing to be sorry for. So that's how it's gonna be? Welcome home, Sawyer. Welcome home, Kate. Hugo? Is that you, Hugo? Oh, my God. What happened? Tricia Tanaka's dead. - What? - Mr. Cluck's... it got hit by a meteor... or an asteroid... I don't know the difference, but it's gone. That's crazy. It's not crazy. It's the lottery money. The numbers-- I'm cursed. And now Tricia Tanaka's dead, and her camera dude, and it's all my fault. It was an accident. It's not an accident. It is a curse. There's only one way to stop it. - I have to go to australia. - Again with australia? That's where the numbers came from. Lenny in the institution-- he told me. Hugo, wait. I can prove to you you're not cursed. - You can? - Yes. Come here with me. I have to show you something. After 17 years, your father has returned. Your mom wasn't kidding about those candy bars. Just kidding. Poor... Roger. Sorry about your arm, dude. In. In. Totally. Let's check it out. Dude, Roger was on a beer run. Oh, man, I suck at charades. You want to what? Oh, you wanna take roger out... then and turn it over? Cool. I understand! Okay, on three. One... two... three. We'll get that later. So when's it gonna happen? - When's what gonna happen? - Don't play stupid with me... brother. I was drunk. You know, if I said anything-- I have a right to know when I'm gonna die. - It doesn't work like that. - What doesn't work like that? Hey, Oliver Twist. - Where the hell's my stuff? - What stuff? Oh, you know good and damn well what stuff! I had books, food, porno, a bottle of scotch. Aye, apologies for the scotch, mate. You drank it? Well, to be fair, there was, there was three of us. Yeah, there was. You, the munchkin and who else? Oh, I got it. We're gonna tip it up. Crafty. Crafty? Yeah, crafty. It's like... when you're good at... crafts. Never mind. Where the hell's my stuff? - What are y'all doing? - Dude! You're alive! Yeah, yeah, snuffy. It's good to see you, too. I'll be damn. Y'all found yourselves a hippie car. Pretty cool, huh? - Sawyer. - Jin-Bo. How you doing? Good... see you. Well, look at that. Somebody's hooked on phonics. What about Jack and Kate? They with you? They all right? Kate's with me... but the doc... they still got him. Okay, it's okay. It's gonna be all right. Jack's gonna be all right. We all are. - Well, what a relief. - Nah, see, things are getting better. The car, you coming back safely-- It's a sign. Yeah, a sign I want my stuff back. You're gonna help to fix this thing. And why in the hell would I do that? 'Cause there's beer. Why did he say, "don't come back"? He sacrificed himself so we could escape. Probably didn't want it to be for nothing. Hurley told us they released Michael and Walt. Yep. They gave Michael a boat. They took off and never looked back. Did you see any other boats? No, but something tells me they didn't give away their only one. So they can leave the island? I don't know, John. This "zoo" where they held you-- Is that where they live? We escaped with one of them-- a kid named Karl. He said that they live on this island. He could've taken us there, but Sawyer let him go. - Why? - You're gonna have to ask Sawyer. - Kate, where are you going? - I don't care what Jack said. They've got him, and we have to get him back. I owe him that... So I'm going to get help. Help from who? Now that's a hell of a Jesus. Yes. Hugo is such a good son. He knows of my love for the Savior, so he commissioned artisans in Taxco to custom carve for me this statue in solid gold. That smells like great lasagna. The Trons made it themselves. Hugo found them in Bennigan's. Now they are our butlers. Something wrong, Hugo? Your father asked you a question, Hugo. My father? You're acting like he never left us, like he hasn't been gone for 17 years. And all of a sudden he shows up? Aren't you at least a little suspicious? I showed up because your mom called and said you were in trouble. - What? - All these numbers and curse. Hugo, I don't know what to do anymore. I thought you need a manly influence, a father to get you to stop this nonsense. I'm not crazy! And the only reason he's back is 'cause he wants the money. Oh, now that hurts. Well, guess what? There isn't gonna be any money. Mr. Tron, lady Tron. Your services will no longer be need. Severance. Trust me, I'm doing you a huge favor. It's only a matter of time before the curse gets you, and you... die, or worse. - What are you doing? - Getting rid of it, all of it-- The money, the houses, the livestock... And I'm starting with him. No, Hugo. Your father is staying with us. Staying with us? Where? It's been 17 years, Hugo. What's been 17 years? I have needs. This can't be happening! He has to go! He has to! I want him gone! - No, you don't! - Yeah, I do! Why don't you show your father what you have in the garage? I can't believe it. You saved it. Me first now. Come on. What's up with all this recycling? You got me, dude. Looks like those Dharma freaks were building some sort of dirt road. Now we're talkin'. Looks good to me. Engine's fine, right? Son of... What's a head doing back here? Oh, that's just Roger. I'm gonna start the car now! Engine... Dude, even if you were speaking english, I wouldn't understand a word you're saying. Just relax. We're good. This'll work. I have hope. This will work. Damn it. It's flat, and it stinks. Can you get it to work? You know what's wrong? Chill out. Let the man do his thing. Dude, that beer's been sitting there since before "Rocky III," maybe even "II." It's probably poison by now. Skeletor seems to like it. Bottoms up. That's not cool, dude. That guy had a mom, a family and friends. Oh, and a name. Not Skeletor. It's Roger Workman. It's workman, you blockhead. That's his job. He was a Dharma janitor. Yeah, well you should still respect the dead. Can you fix it? No fix. But you have to! Can't you try, dude? I mean, we gotta get this running! Leave the man alone. He's right. "No fix." Take a look at that mess. There's no way it's gonna get running. How thick are you? What's your problem, man? Why don't you want this to work? I don't care if it works. Why is it so important to you? Because we could all use a little hope. If it's hope you're looking for, I say, you're on the wrong damn island. 'Cause there sure as hell ain't no hope here. Come on Hugo, time to get up! Come on! Rise and shine. Hit the deck. Come on, we're burning daylight. Let's go. What's with the earphones? It's for the noise. Well, your mother's a very passionate woman. That is disgusting. Come on. We're going on an adventure. Let's go. I'm not going anywhere with you. Look, just do this one thing with me. If it doesn't work, you can go to Australia. I won't stop you. Okay? What one thing? We're gonna break the curse. This is stupid. Just give her a chance, man. Cut the deck, please. You've recently come into a great deal of money. Could've seen that on the news. But it hasn't brought you happiness. It's brought you great misfortune. She didn't see that on the news. I'm seeing numbers. What numbers?- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. There's darkness around these numbers... great tragedy. I'm... I'm sorry. What? What is it? Death... ... surrounds you... and... more is coming. Your hands, please. There's a curse on you. But it can be removed. Now, Hugo, I need you to remove your clothes. My clothes? A curse is like an unwelcome entity that lives inside you, and it must be exorcised. Did my dad put you up to this? - What? - Hugo, please. I'll give you $1,000 right now If you admit that my dad told you to say this stuff. The mystic arts are not subject to bribes. - How dare you-- - $10,000. Your dad put me up to it. I was just trying to help. Help who? Beer. Bingo. Beautiful. Car. International house of pancakes. What are you doing over there? I'm praying. - Praying for what? - Help. Well, hell, I got you a little help right here. Stop moping. Come on. I'm not moping. I'm thinking. When people stare out at the ocean and get all quiet-like, they're moping. So get up and come with me. That car I found-- we're getting it running. What's the point? - What did you do that for? - Snap out of it. Stop feeling sorry for yourself 'Cause someone said you're gonna die. I got an idea that's gonna help us both. Now... ... it is dangerous, and there's a very good chance that you will die. This is supposed to convince me to come with you? It is, 'cause if you don't die, - then we win. - Win? Look, I don't know about you, but things have really sucked for me lately, and I could really use a victory. So let's get one, dude. Let's get this car started. Let's look death in the face and say, "whatever, man." Let's make our own luck. What do you say? I'm sorry. Okay, nice. Keep it coming. You... were... right. Okay. That's two. Hit me. Those pants don't make you look fat. Now you got it! The only three things a woman needs to hear. Come on, get up. We got work to do. What's your problem, jumbotron? Shut up, red... neck... man. Touché. - What's Jiminy Cricket doing here? - We need another man. - Another man for what? - To push this car, dude. Push it? Push it where? This is gonna be real good. So you're going to Australia? Long way to go 'cause some stupid numbers-- I'd really like you to leave. When your mom called me about the lottery, I was on my bike before she could hang the phone up. I'm getting old. Yeah, I saw my retirement. You're right. I'm here for the money. Well, you're not getting any of it. Well, that's not why I'm here talking to you now. I'm here talking to you now because going to Australia's not gonna break any curse. You don't need to leave. You just... you need a little hope. We make our own luck, Hugo. You know what I think you should do? What? I think you should give away the money-- All of it, every penny. Just save enough for a... a carburetor. Work on the Camaro, you know, just you and me. Take it off the blocks and make that road trip to the Grand Canyon. Never too late for a fresh start. I'll send you a postcard from Sydney. I'll be here when you get back. Are you nuts? You're not gonna drive down that. We're gonna jump-start it. You guys are gonna push it, and then on the way down, I'm gonna pop the clutch and get it started. You see those rocks? All you're gonna do is crash into those real fast, if you don't roll over first. - Hurley, no. - Dudes, I know how to drive. Now come on. Just push me. This will work. I know it. And what are you out here for... Watch him crash and burn? I came to ride shotgun. Well, it's your funeral. Come on. Let's give 'em their ride. Are you sure you want to do this? Victory or death. Push! Careful now! Here we go! Now would be a good time, Hurley. Like right now! There is no curse. You make your own luck. You make your own luck. There is no curse! If you were looking for help to find Jack, why didn't you ask us? Two reasons-- you don't know where to look, and you're not motivated. And I don't blame you. Why would you want to go on another trek across the island, risk more lives just to get Jack back? - You're wrong. - Oh, really? Then why didn't you come after-- Not about the motivation, just about knowing where to look. We got a compass bearing, and I'm pretty sure if we follow it, - it'll lead us right to him. - How? Because of the way the sunlight hit Mr. Eko's stick when John was burying him. So now you know our secret. How about you tell us yours? No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot. It's all right! It's safe! We're just here to talk! You can come out! What are you doing here? I came to ask for your help. To do what? I'm heading to the others' camp, and if I'm gonna find it, I need someone who knows the island. What makes you think I have an interest in helping you? Because they had me, and they would have never let me go. They probably would've killed me if I hadn't escaped. And the girl who helped me escape... she was about 16 years old.
