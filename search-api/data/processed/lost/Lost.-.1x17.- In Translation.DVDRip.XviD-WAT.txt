- [Charlie] What should we do? What's going on? l don't know. He walked up and started going off on her again. Hey. Hey, hey, hey! Jin! Get your hands off her! l swear to God, you put your hands on her one more time... Get your hands off me! - [knocking] - [door opening] Michael? l'm sorry. Don't worry. l stuck my nose where it didn't belong. lt's on me. You must understand. l got to get this raft finished so l can get my boy and take him home. When l slapped you, l was protecting you. - Yeah? From what? - From Jin. You don't know what he's capable of. lt's not my problem. lt's yours. [grunts] Why don't you try sea urchin? They got more ping. Hey. l know things got kind of nasty down there at the beach. l don't want to get involved in husband and wife stuff, but l figured, you know, you might need to relax. So... Come on, dude, l'm trying here. - [grunts] - OK. You want to be an outsider? lt's your business. [Shannon] l tied this side down. Do you think this is gonna hold? Do you have a past in the Navy you've neglected to tell me about? - Why? - How does a woman like you learn how to tie a perfect bowline knot? By dating guys with sailboats. Since you bring it up, l've been worried since l first met you that you might end up a spinster. Spending my Saturday nights alone at home tying knots? Perhaps with an overweight aunt. lt's a very sad image. Maybe we should get some rope, spend a Saturday night alone together, and see what happens. Dad? Thanks. You are gonna love New York, Walt. No city like it. What l really want to show you - are the buildings, architecture. - Buildings? l said that, 'til l saw the Flatiron Building. - What's that? - Oldest skyscraper in the city. Built in 1 902. And it's flat. That one building inspired me to start drawing and designing things. - Why? - You just gotta see it. - You want to see it, right? - l guess. Can l go throw the ball to Vincent? Yeah. Sure. Of course. - Come on, Vincent! - [barking] [Jack] Wow, you're making a lot of progress. - Yeah, trying. - lt's pretty cool. Got this bamboo for the decking, got a piece of the fuselage for a cabin. Some storage bins. What's up? l thought l'd give you the heads-up. Yeah? There's a lot of talk going on about who's going on this thing with you. Hey, man, it's not the <i>Queen Mary.</i> l only got room for four people. There's one open spot. Who took the other one? What's the matter, doc? Feeling left out? - You're taking Sawyer with you? - Yep. Bought myself a ticket on this little tub. Let me tell you, the fare was steep. Could have used that cable to hold up my new beach house. You sold him a spot? l needed halyards for the mast. Good thing l'm a saver, not a spender, huh, Doc? How much longer are you gonna let him treat you this way? - Please... - Sun. He's my husband. A husband you're afraid to tell you speak English. l'm trying to understand, Sun. He wasn't always like this. He used to tell me how beautiful l looked to him. He was so tender. And then he was different. What changed him? - [man] Need some help! - [people yelling] Hey, Charlie, what's going on? The raft, it's on fire. Look. No! No! No! Where is he? Where the hell is he? Where is he? [speaking Korean] - Where is he? - She doesn't understand. - Hey! Where is he? - Back off. Her husband did this. She knows! You trying to protect him now? - She was with me! - No, Walt! Get back. - No, it's done. - Sun, wait! l'm gonna break his damn neck! - Just take it easy, man. - We don't know that Jin did this. - Are you serious? - Sawyer, shut up! - We saw him on the beach. - That doesn't mean he torched the raft. Yeah, then who did, Jack? [speaking Korean] [panting] [knocking] What do you want? l'd like to talk to you about Shannon. lt's very possible your sister and l are going to become more than just friends. What is this, some Middle Eastern thing? You want my blessing or something? - My hope is you won't object. - Yeah? l was extending a courtesy, not asking your permission. Let me tell you about my sister. She likes older men, guys who can take care of her. My guess is in this place you fit the bill. She'll make you feel like the greatest while you get her whatever she needs, and once she gets what she wants, she'll move on. When she does, don't take it personally, man. [bird flies off] Messed up my ride, chief. [grunts] Hey, there you are. Come help me with this. l'm completely destroying it. - You seem to be doing just fine. - Yeah, fine at making it collapse. You're very capable, Shannon. l'm sure you'd be all right building it on your own. What's going on? Perhaps you should find another friend to help you with your shelter. You've been talking to my brother, haven't you? Oh, gross! Gross to you, dinner to me. Boone, where is he? - Don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - You two are like jungle pals. - Sorry. l haven't seen him. Well, if you do see him, tell him to keep his mouth shut. lf he has something to say, leave Sayid out of it - and say it to my face. - Should l be writing this down? Just tell him to stay the hell out of my business. Do you like him? - What? - Sayid. Are you serious? Because if you do like him, what's it got to do with your brother? You're a grown woman. You can yell at Boone 'til you're blue in the face, all you're doing is giving him what he wants. - Yeah, what's that? - Your attention. Everyone gets a new life on this island, Shannon. Maybe it's time you start yours. You must be pretty scared, huh? Scared. You understand scared, don't you? Huh? lf you ain't, you're gonna be, Bruce. Folks down on the beach might have been doctors and accountants a month ago, but it's <i>Lord of the Flies</i> time now. [speaking Korean] [cell phone rings] [telephone rings] [continues] - [grunting] - [groaning] [woman crying] [whispering] [dog barks] [groans] - [Jack] Michael! Take it easy! - l'll take it easy, all right! Hang on, man! - Hey, you burned my raft? - Just calm down. - Hey, step aside. - Just calm down! You burned my raft? Why'd you burn my raft, man? Calm down and think about it a minute. - Look at his hands. - Back off, Jack. Shut it! Everyone's gotta chill out! [yelling becomes unintelligible] [speaking Korean] What'd he say? [speaking Korean] You said something to me? - Michael! - [speaking Korean] Say it again. No, no, say it again, man! - Hey! Hey! - Easy, doc! - One fight at a time. - He's right. This is between them. [speaking Korean] [groaning] [speaking Korean] Stop it! Leave him alone! He didn't burn your raft. - You speak English? - Didn't see that coming. You understood us all this time? Why didn't you say anything? Your raft was already on fire when he arrived. He burned his hands trying to put it out. Then why did he run? [speaking Korean] Exactly. That's what l thought. My husband is many things, but he is not a liar. You're gonna lecture us about lying, Betty? From the look on his face, even your old man here didn't know you speak English. - How do we know she's not covering? - Because she isn't! - Why would he burn the raft? - He's been after me! - Everybody knows it! - OK, it's personal. Why take it out on our best chance at getting off the island? Why would any one of us block an attempt to get home? We're so intent on pointing the finger at one another that we're ignoring the simple undeniable truth that the problem isn't here, it's there! They've attacked us! Sabotaged us, abducted us, murdered us. Maybe it's time we stop blaming us and started worrying about them! We're not the only people on this island, and we all know it! He did not do it. [barks] [Michael] Look at this. l can't salvage a thing. Pontoons, the decking... Fire burnt up all the twine! Damn it! God... - l'm sorry, man. - lt's OK. No. Come here. Come here. Look... We all have setbacks. l mean, God knows, man. That's just life. We'll start over, all right? You're gonna build another one? Yeah. A better one. Can l help? No doubt you can help. [chuckling] Come on! [speaking Korean] l was going to leave you! l was going to get away. But you made me change my mind. You made me think that you still loved me. [speaking Korean] What was that for? Everyone gets a new life on this island. l'd like to start now. Got yourself an opponent? Hurley owes me $83,000. l told him l'd give him a chance to win it back. lt's been a while since you and l played. - l don't have $83,000. - That's OK. - Where's your pop? - Down at the beach, l think. l'm not allowed to leave the caves after dark. Do you have a dad? Everyone's got a dad. ls he cool? No. No, he's not. - Yes! - Good for you. Hey, you mind if l ask you something? Sure. Why did you burn the raft, Walt? Don't worry. l'm not gonna tell. You must have had a really good reason. l don't want to move anymore. l've been moving places my whole life. l like it here. l like it here too. Boat. Hey.
