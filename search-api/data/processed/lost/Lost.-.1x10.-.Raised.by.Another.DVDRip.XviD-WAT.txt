French! The French are coming! l've never been so happy to hear the French! - Does anyone speak French? - She does. [woman speaking French, static] [Shannon] ''l'm alone now. On the island alone. Please, someone come. The others, they're... They're dead. lt killed them. lt killed them all.'' [static] - l can't stay here. - There's nowhere to go. Someone has to walk the shore and map the island. See what else there is. l hope we meet again. [baby crying] - [baby crying] - [gasping] [whimpering] [baby crying] [baby crying] - What's happening? - You know what's happening. - But l don't understand. Why...? - lt was your responsibility, but you gave him away, Claire. - Everyone pays the price now. - [crying] [rumbling] [screaming] Hey, hey, hey, hey! lt's Charlie! lt's Charlie! Wait, wait, wait a minute! lt's okay! lt's okay. - lt's all right. You were dreaming. - [sobbing] You were sleepwalking. All right? Okay. Claire, what happened? Must have been a hell of a nightmare. Who said it was a nightmare? When someone makes a fist so tight they dig their nails a quarter of an inch into their palms, they probably weren't dreaming about riding ponies. - Did you ever sleepwalk before? - No. l don't think so. - How would l know? - lt'd get back to you. l had a girlfriend once that, uh, told me l talked in my sleep. - What did you say? - Don't know. Whatever it was, she didn't like it. - How was your OB<i>l</i>G YN in Sydney? - Good. She was good. She was okay with letting you fly in your third trimester? Yeah, l went for a checkup a week before, and she said it would be fine. - Ultrasound was cool? - Mm-hmm. Very healthy. - How you been feeling? - Okay. Back's pretty sore, but probably just from sleeping on the ground. l get dizzy if l stand up too fast. - And l have to pee all the time. - [laughing] - You eating enough? - Boar and bananas. How many weeks in are you? What was the date that you found out that you were pregnant? - [man] ls it pink? - l don't know. l mean, did you actually pee on it? - Just give me a second. - Maybe you didn't do it right. - Thomas, l can pee on a stick. - What color is it? How long's it been? - Six... 66 seconds. Oh, gosh. - Shh. - Okay, there's definitely two lines. - Two pink lines? Pink? No, no, no. These are, like, red. What? They're pink. These two lines... First of all, these tests are not always accurate. No, no, no. My uncle, you know, we thought he had testicular cancer. - You remember that? - He did. He's dead. Well, yeah... l mean, no, no. lt was like a wrong... lt was a bad diagnosis. This thing doesn't mean for sure you're pregnant. - Thomas! - Get another. l am six weeks late, okay? Six weeks. That never happens. l'm pregnant. [sobbing] Okay. Okay, look, it's all gonna be okay. l know. l know. Hey, Claire... You know, if we wanted to, we could do this. - [scoffs] Stop it. - No, l'm not kidding. - My mom would disown me. - She basically has already. Yeah, and but with what? l mean, my $5-an-hour job at Fish 'n Fry? You're not the only one with a job, you know? l mean, l've got my painting. That's sweet, but... - This isn't what we want. - Maybe it is. You know? This could be like, uh... l don't know. lt could be, like, the best thing ever. You'd really want to try? Yeah. Claire, l love you. Well, this is a first. You standing still, middle of the day, doing nothing. - Amazing. - l'm doing something. [laughing] Yeah? What's that? l'm sinking. Water goes out, takes the sand with it and you sink. l used to do it with my mom when l was a kid. Ah. New plan. You're gonna just sink your way right off the island. Sayid would be proud. He's been gone for almost a week. Something tells me he'll be okay. So, what are you doing this far from the caves? Bringing water down. Bringing fish back. Claire's gonna have the baby soon. Dear diary, still on the bloody island. Today, l swallowed a bug. Love, Claire. [chuckles] [sighs] Here. What separates us from these savage Yanks if we can't drink tea? - Feeling better? - lt was just a dream. Mmm. l have this dream. l'm driving a bus, and my teeth start falling out. My mum is in the back, eating biscuits. Everything smells of bacon. lt's weird. Of course, l don't wake up screaming. l'm all right, Charlie. Mmm. No, of course you are. lt's just... ...l think about you... ...in this place. How hard it must be for you, without your family and your friends. And l think, we could be friends. l could be your friend. We don't have to do each other's hair or anything. l just mean that, you know, if you needed someone to talk to about anything, l'm here. Charlie... Okay. - l didn't mean that l... - lt's cool, Claire. lt's cool. Thomas cleaned out his whole loft. - l'm officially moving in on Tuesday. - That is great! l know. He's awesome. - You know, maybe we shouldn't... - No. - You're not backing out now. - lt seems silly. He's just a psychic, Claire. l thought you were into this, all your astrology stuff. Yeah, l know, but l don't need somebody telling me what's gonna happen or how to live my life. lt's not about what you need. lt's about what's fun. So unless you have another excuse... l'll need your hands for this. [sighs] [grunts] So when did you find out? - What? - About the baby. Um... Two days ago. - She hasn't told her mum yet... - Shh. What, should l not tell her? What? What is it? l'm sorry. Um... l can't... l can't... [gasps] What were you gonna...? What did you see? - l'm not doing this reading. - No, you were gonna say something. You'll have to leave. Now. Thanks, thanks very much. What a freak. [shrieks] [Claire screaming] Help me! Somebody's trying to hurt me! Please! Help me! - Someone attacked her! - What? - He held me down! - [Charlie] Which way did he go? - l couldn't see... - What's going on? Just now! He just ran away! Fan out, check the surrounding caves. - Wait, wait, hold on. - Hurley, come on, let's go. Come on. Come on. Let's sit down here, okay? - Can you get her some water? - Sure. Claire, look at me. lt's okay. You're safe now. - Did you get a look at him at all? - lt was dark. l couldn't see. - Where did this happen? - [sobbing] He was here! l mean, l was sleeping, and l woke up, and he was trying to hurt my baby! He had this thing, like a needle, and he stabbed me with it! He was trying to hurt my baby. lt's okay. lt's okay. We hoofed around the entire perimeter, man. - Nobody saw or heard anything? - Uh-uh. Nada. Everyone was asleep. So, l had an idea. l'm out here looking for some psycho with Scott and Steve, right? And l'm realizing, who the hell are Scott and Steve? - l'm not following you. - Look, if l was a cop, and some woman got attacked, we'd canvas, right? Knock on doors, find witnesses. But we don't even have doors. You're not helping me understand... We don't know who's living here, and who's still at the beach. l mean, we don't even know each other. My name isn't Hurley. lt's Hugo Reyes. Hurley's just a nickname l have, all right? Why? l'm not telling. The point is, we got to find out who everyone is. - You want to start a census? - A registry. Names, what people look like, who's related to who. We lay down the law, people will stop attacking each other. Seems like someone's punched or stabbed every other day. We got to find out who did this to her. You all right? Don't worry. lf you want to close your eyes, l'll be here all night. l won't let anyone get to you. l won't leave you, Claire. Promise. [door slams] - Wow, we have drapes now. - l know. l feel all grown up. - [giggles] You like 'em? - Yeah. They're good. l don't know why drapes represent age for me. l guess it just feels like something my mum would do. Oh, um, Sasha called. They're going out tonight. They wanted to know if we'd go. [Claire] What? l didn't eat all the chips. There's another bag. Claire? l can't do this. Do what? Did you have a bad day? This isn't working. - Come on, you knew that. - l what? Just so l'm not overreacting here, are you breaking up with me? For the past three months, it's just, there's some plan, some responsibility, somewhere we have to be, someone you have to talk to. l'm trying to make sure when the baby comes... ''When the baby...'' Yeah. l mean, that is just not... lf it's like this now, you know, what's it gonna be like when the baby comes? - But you said we should do this. - Yeah. Yeah, well, now it's real. You can't just change your mind. How in the hell am l supposed to be a dad, Claire? How about my painting? My life? l knew... l knew this was gonna happen. l told you so. Perfect. Now l get all your daddy abandonment crap. Hey, you bastard, don't you dare try and justify what you're doing! l have done nothing! l've done absolutely nothing. What, l have? You don't think l've seen what you've done? - Excuse me? - You were supposed to be on the Pill. - You think l got pregnant on purpose? - l don't even care. Or that this was some kind of plan? You are out of your mind! - lt's over, Claire! - No, it's not over! - l'm out of here. - Thomas! [door slams] John, right? John Locke? ls this about your census? Yeah, you know, l thought it would be a good idea, you know, get everyone's name and place of residence. And who's checking on you? Uh, me. lt was a joke. - Uh, good one. - Yep. You already know my name. l lived most of my life in Tustin, California. Cool. And reason for travel? The reason you were in Australia? - l was looking for something. - Looking. Uh-huh. Right on. Something. So, did you find it? No, it found me. - Anything else? - No, no, that's good. Uh, thanks. Hey, uh, l know l already talked to you, but l just wanted to get away from him for a second. Did you see anyone leave the beach last night? People come and go, but... No, l don't know. What? - l'm not sure anything happened. - Wait, what? Claire told Michael and l that this attacker tried to inject her with something. But there was no mark on her stomach. She wakes up two nights screaming. First time, sleepwalking. Think she's making this up? She was terrified. She said he was hurting her baby. Why would someone do that - with us 20 feet away? - You think she's lying? No. Pregnant woman have extremely lucid... - Lucid. - Textbook anxiety nightmares. You know everything that's going on with everyone? So, what do we do? Claire's due in a little more than a week. Maybe two. But if she stays stressed out like this or has another panic attack, it could trigger an early labor. Out here with no instruments, no monitors, no anesthetic... That would not be good. lt's not all in her head. - Hey, Lance. - Sorry? Lance. Your name's Lance, right? - Ethan. - Dude, that's right. Lance is a skinny guy with glasses and red hair. l can see how you'd confuse us. Sorry, dude. Lots of names and faces. Pathetic. You'd think after a couple weeks on the island with the same people, we'd know each other. - You're right. You would think so. - So we're doing this list, all the survivors' names, home addresses, stuff like that. Okay, well, you already have my name. - All right, not Lance. - Definitely not. - Last name? - Rom. - Rom, R-O-M? - That's right. - Great. Where you from, Ethan Rom? - Ontario. Right on. Love Canada. Great, uh... Well, that should do it. Thanks for your time, dude. - Hey, what's this for? - Oh, it's nothing. Just, you know, thought it'd be a good idea. [Jack] Claire? Did you find him? - Um, no. - What if he comes back? Claire... This situation that we're in, the crash, that no one's coming, this place, it can kind of mess with your head a little and make you see things that aren't actually there. Now, l know it feels very real... - l don't under... - Look, your baby's coming. Soon. And l can't even imagine how scary that must be for you. But the more upset you are, the more dangerous it is for you, and your baby. So l want you to take these. - What are they? - lt's a sedative. Very mild, commonly used in situations like yours. lt won't harm the baby. l promise. You don't believe me. - Claire... - You think l'm making this up? l get attacked, and you want to give me sleeping pills? They're not sleeping... Look, it's a very mild sedative. - l'm leaving. - What? No! Claire. Claire... lt was safe at the beach. lt's not safe here. - Don't do this. Think about the baby. - Don't talk to me about the baby. l'm sick of everyone telling me what to do. Let go of me. You okay? What did you say to her? [knocking] - Yes? - Mr. Malkin, we met before? - Yes, l remember. - You wouldn't give me a reading. l was hoping you would now. lf you're a psychic, why do you have to count it? - That's not how it works. - l was just joking. [sighs] So... how does it work? l don't know. When did he leave you? Last week. ls that why you didn't want to do my reading? No, no, no. l saw something, sort of a blurry thing. And blurry's bad? Blurry's bad. That's why l stopped the reading. Are you sure you want to go on now? Yes, please. [panting] l can tell you, this is important. - Okay. - lt is crucial that you, yourself, raise this child. You mean with Thomas? ls he...? The father of this child will play no part in its life, nor yours. - So, what exactly are you saying? - This child parented by anyone else, anyone other than you... - Danger surrounds this baby. - Danger? Your nature, your spirit, your goodness must be an influence in the development of this child. Look, if Thomas and l don't, you know, get back together, l'm putting this baby up for adoption. l just wanted to find out what would give the baby the happiest life. There is no happy life. Not for this child, not without you. - l don't... - There can't be another. You mustn't allow another to raise your baby. Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my 200. Look, take it. Miss Littleton, l am begging you just to consider... - l can't raise this child by myself. - You have to listen to me! Thanks for your time and my money back! The baby needs your protection! Miss Littleton! Please! [phone rings] - Hello? - <i>Miss Littleton, it's Richard Malkin.</i> - Oh, my God. - <i>Listen to me. I have a plan,</i> something that will make this all better. You've got to stop calling me. lt's too late, all right? l'm going to see Adoptive Services tomorrow. I've been telling you for months, you cannot do that. What l do with my baby is none of your business. If you don't do what I'm suggesting, great danger will befall... Great danger will befall you if you don't stop calling me - in the middle of the night. - <i>I know what you're feeling inside.</i> You're doubting your decision to give up the baby. Look, I'm begging you, don't do it. At least hear my plan first. Good night. [Charlie] Hi. - Where are you going? - Back to the beach. - Well, what happened? Did Jack...? - Jack tried to dope me. He thinks l'm making all this up, that none of it really happened. Right. So, to prove your sanity, you go tromping through the jungle alone. Well done. l'm not crazy, Charlie. You want my information? Name<i>:</i> Shannon Rutherford. Age<i>:</i> 20. Address<i>:</i> Craphole lsland. So, uh, where were you guys last night? Um, the beach. Why the interrogation? You're like the twentieth person to ask me that. Why is everyone uptight about answering questions? Well, maybe we're just not cool with you setting up your own little Patriot Act, man. He's a liberal. - Seriously, why the list? - lt's nothing. We had an incident in the valley last night. - An incident? - Yeah, Claire, the pregnant girl. You know her? She, uh, kind of got attacked. - What? - She okay? - Yeah, she's a little shook up, but... - l am not moving to the Rape Caves. Your life would be much easier if you just had the manifest. We crossed out names of the dead after we burned the fuselage, so should be a full roster of the rest of us. What? Really? Who has it? Who do you think? l'm just gonna lay it out straight. Okay, you do that. l hear you have the flight manifest, and l need it and want you to give it to me. - That so? - Now, you could do what you normally do when someone asks for something, tell me to screw off. - Screw off? - Or you could just give it to me. 'Cause, dude, you could use the points. Well, gosh, you sure know how to butter a man up, Stay-Puff. lt's a gift. [chuckles] Manifest is in the brown suitcase. Take it. - Please let me carry your bag. - l'm fine. l know you're fine, but l can carry your bag. Why did you come after me? Well, it's probably because l like you. - What? - You don't like me, Charlie, okay? You just want to rescue me because l'm... Because of this. But l'm fine, okay? l don't need rescuing. l don't need... - Claire? What is it? - [gasping] What? Claire, what? What is it? - Was that another one? - Yeah. We need to time the contractions. That's what you do. Time the contractions, okay? One sugar plum fairy, two sugar plum fairy... You just need to calm down, all right? Big deep breaths. - Bloody hell. - l need you to go get Jack. - l'll be all right. - l'm not leaving you alone. - l can deliver a baby. l can do this. - Please, go! - You don't know how to... - Listen. l might not know what l'm doing, but l'll figure it out. lf l can kick drugs, l can deliver a baby. Let me explain. l'm a drug addict. l was a drug addict. l'm clean now. - Get Jack! - Right. [man] Arlene and Joseph will bring you to Melbourne. They'll pay your living and medical expenses. We found you an apartment. lt's a really nice two-bedroom place, and we think you're gonna be really comfortable in it. As discussed, once the baby's born and handed over to the Stewarts, you'll have no right to see the child again. You'll have no right to correspond with the child, it will be entirely up to Arlene and Joseph to decide whether to tell the child anything about you. Understood? - Yes. - Upon your discharge from the hospital, you will be given an additional payment of $20,000. l just want to make sure that you're gonna take really good care of the baby. Of course we will. Now, l'll need you to sign and date here where indicated. Do you know <i>Catch a Falling Star?</i> lt's a song, like a lullaby. ''Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket.'' My dad used to sing that to me when l was little. Do you think you could sing it to the baby once in a while? Of course. lt's not working. Here. l'm... l'm... l'm sorry. - l can't do this. - [Arlene] What? No! No! Okay, what is it? What's your offer? - Thank God! What's your name? - Ethan. Are you all right? Go the caves. Run to the caves. Get Jack. - Tell him Claire... - Claire. She okay? She's having the baby. Go fast, okay? l'll be with her, on the path there. Go! - Claire! - l'm here! Claire! Okay, Jack's coming. - How you doing? - lt hurts. Okay, just take my hand. Squeeze. Okay, breathe. lnhale. Exhale. Good. Just breathe. lnhale. Okay, good. - Oh, l'm not supposed to be here. - We all feel like that a little bit. [stammering] l know. lt's just... Someone promised me it would be different. Well, he was wrong. Yeah. He was wrong. You spent the last four months telling me l have to raise the baby myself. Now you're giving me money and saying l don't have to? l found a couple in Los Angeles who are very eager to adopt. The baby will be safe in their care. - Now, l've foreseen... - You've foreseen. l don't even know why l'm here. l'm sorry. l know this sounds ridiculous, Claire, all this psychic business, and l appreciate that you must think l'm a raving madman. But this is what must happen. So you're giving me $6,000 to give my baby to a couple of strangers in Los Angeles? $1 2,000. The other six when you arrive in Los Angeles. And they're not strangers, Claire. They're good people. - A psychic? - l know. lt's embarrassing. And after everything, he was just full of it. Or not. l mean, all he wanted was that no one else raise your baby, right? Maybe he knew. l mean, if you wanted it bad enough... You know, if he had the gift, and l believe some people do... Maybe he knew, Claire. l can't go tomorrow. l have to get my... lt has to be this flight. lt can't be any other. They're already scheduled to meet you when you arrive. Flight 81 5. Flight 81 5. There was no couple in Los Angeles. [Claire] <i>He knew.</i> He knew about the plane, what was gonna happen... Oh, my God, he knew. - You feel another one coming? - l don't think so. Where the hell is Jack? You know, l think... - l think l'm all right. - The contractions? Maybe that was the last one. Please, let that have been the last one. Jack said that stress can cause a false labor. You sure you're all right? No pain. Birthing emergency averted. l told you l'd take care of you. - Thanks, Charlie. - You're quite welcome. You think you can make it back to the caves? l won't let anything happen to you. - Okay. - Okay. Let's go. [Jack] Sayid. Listen to me. l found her, the Frenchwoman. l need some water. - What happened? - The woman on the island... l had to come back. l had to come back. We're not alone. [gasping] - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, he just kicked. Here. We got a problem. The manifest. Jack, the census, the names of everyone who survived. All 46 of us. l interviewed everyone, here, at the beach. l got their names. One of them... One of them isn't... Jack. One of them isn't in the manifest.
