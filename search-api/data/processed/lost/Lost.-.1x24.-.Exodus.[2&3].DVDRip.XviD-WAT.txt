- <i>[static, speaking in French on radio]</i> The French are coming! l've never been so happy to hear the French. - Does anyone speak French? - <i>[French continues on radio]</i> [Shannon] ''l'm alone now. On the island alone. Please, someone come. They're dead. lt killed them. lt killed them all.'' Guys... where are we? [Sayid] l found the wire on the beach. l thought it might have something to do with the transmission we picked up. ...with a Frenchwoman repeating on a loop for 1 6 years. Has it really been that long? You. Your people, the ones you're determined to get back to. Watch them closely. [Claire sobbing] l mean, l was sleeping, and l woke up, and he was trying to hurt my baby! - We gotta find out who everyone is. - Wanna start a census? [Hurley] l interviewed everyone at the beach. Jack. One of them isn't in the manifest. He wasn't on the plane. We're not the only people on this island, and we all know it! They've attacked us! Sabotaged us, abducted us, murdered us. Maybe it's time we started worrying about them. [Sayid] Danielle? What are you doing here? When l saw black smoke... That night, they came. [Rousseau] You have only three choices. Run. Hide. Or die. [Jack] All l can tell you is we do have a plan. [Arzt] Go into the jungle, get some dynamite, blow open a hatch, and then you hide everyone inside. God knows how long that dynamite has been out there. So, unless you want to blow up, l'm coming with you. - [Michael] Good luck. - Same to you. - See you soon. - Yes, you will. [Michael] Keep it straight. Go, go! [Walt] Bye, Vincent. - Come on, go. - Bye, Vincent. [cheering] [baby crying] Okay. [sighing] Shhh. Claire. Everybody's leaving. Well, l can't go anywhere, all right? l've got the baby and l'm... l'm so tired. l can't... can't carry him. And now he's wet and there's sand everywhere. - l don't have anymore nappies. - Why don't you let me help? No, look, nobody ever taught me how to do this. Okay? - lt's gonna be okay. - Why do people keep telling me that? Are they the ones with the baby? [Sayid] We've got to get there before sundown. Once you reach the caves, stay there. The rest of us will be right behind you. Sayid. l need a gun. l know Jack gave 'em to you. l want one right now. l have to protect Claire. Rousseau said the others won't be here till night. She's certifiable. What if they show up before? - Last time you had a sidearm... - l killed a murderer. l did us a favor. You're emotionally involved. Let me handle the weapons. You're not here all the time. You can't protect her. l need a gun. lf you want to help Claire, get her packed, carry her child to the caves. That's what she needs. How exactly does something like this happen? Are you on the same island as l am? l guess that explains it. Hold on, wait... Hold, wait. What are we, a couple miles inland? A tsunami probably swept it here. Huh? Right? [Jack] Hey. Hey, where are you going? The explosives are in the hold of the ship. [Jack] Rousseau, wait. l did what you asked. You need dynamite. You don't need me. Let her go, Jack. Who's gonna lead us back? l'll lead us back. Damn it. You heard her. Explosives are in the hold. Let's go. Hold on. l came here to tell you how to handle dynamite, not explore a ghost ship. You think... Just... stay out here. Um... l'm gonna stay out here and hang with Arnzt. [rattling] [Locke] Slaves. [crashing] This ship must have been en route to a mining colony. Probably set off from the eastern coast of Africa. Mozambique. Jack. John. Over here. ...and then my third wife, she says, get this, ''l didn't sign up for this.'' You tell me, what the hell is that even supposed to mean? What, am l boring you? Huh? You know what? l'm sorry. l'm sorry that l'm not cool enough to be part of your merry little band of adventurers. What? l know a clique when l see it. l teach high school, pally! You know, you people think you're the only ones on this island doing anything of value. l got news for you. There were 40 other survivors of this plane crash, and we are all people too. Okay. You know what, l can probably get it open if l just... No. We should take it outside. Why? You don't even know if this... You're not prying open a crate that says ''Explosives'' with a pickax. [Locke] Yeah, l agree with Jack. Take it outside, open it there. Okay. l got it. You mind showing us the way? [Arzt] lt's not just the teenagers. The gym teachers, you think they let me sit with them in the cafeteria? No. They do not. This is all in your head. Really? You explain to me why Kate gets the best pieces of wreckage for her shelter? And the Korean guy. Does he catch fish for everybody on the island? No. He does not. He doesn't. And some of us have actually lost weight while we were here. You mind telling me where you're hiding the carbs? - 'Cause l can't figure... - [creaking] What the hell are you people doing? Wait, wait. Stop. Stop right where you are. Put that down carefully. Put it down carefully. Put it gently... Gently. Damn it! Carefully, gently. Gently. Get outta there. Get away from it. Come on. - Get out. Move away from it. - What the hell is your...? Shh. Be quiet. Do any of you have any idea what happens to dynamite in 90-plus degree heat? Huh? Do you know? Any of you? lt sweats nitroglycerin. [sighs] What are you doing? Did l ask you to come closer? Dynamite... ...is nitroglycerine stabilized by clay. Nitroglycerine... ...is the most dangerous and unstable explosive known to man. Hey Kate, gimme your shirt. Now. Princess, give me your shirt. l need to wrap the dynamite. Just throw it to me, right here. Just be careful. Come on, hurry up. Okay, good. Now back up. Back up. Just back up. Get outta my way. Any of you ever hear about the guy who invented nitroglycerin? Probably not, because he blew his freaking face off. His lab assistant came into the room, saw that his mentor had detonated, and he said<i>:</i> ''Huh. l guess this stuff does work.'' [sighs] We're not gonna take more of this stuff than we need, because nitroglycerine is extremely temperamental. So we just... Dude. [speaking in Korean] Ahhh! - Sorry for the inconvenience. - l'm sure you are. Sir, your bag was unattended. - Am l free to go? - Yes, sir. Good. l have a plane to catch. Could you hand me a paper towel there, bud? Uh, paper towel, this one's broken. - Uh... - Oh. Oh. You don't speak English. Sorry. [speaking in Korean] [electronic whirring] Dad, look! How does a place this big never get discovered? [Sawyer] Don't know. But you could build yourself one hell of a beach resort right over there. Yeah, you build your resort. l'm happy to say goodbye to this place forever. What about everybody else? Think they'll be okay? - [Sawyer singing <i>Redemption Song]</i> - l hope so, buddy. At least until we can get 'em some help. ~ <i>Redemption songs</i> ~ <i>Is all I ever had...</i> Singing Bob Marley? No. Why? You like Bob Marley? Man, who doesn't like Bob Marley? [Shannon sighs] Damn it! Do you really need all that? Yeah. l do. Why do you have to bring so much? Don't you have a hike to lead? l'm fine. These belonged to your brother. l need these things. l can't just leave them. What are we doing? Hiding? As if they won't find us. [sobbing] lt's just... lt's too much. lt's too much. lt won't be too much if l carry it for you. Now come on. l have a hike to lead. You okay? That was messed up. Yeah. He just... ...exploded... ...in front of us. He was just trying to help. This is because l came. What? l'm... ...kind of bad luck. Hey... lt was an accident. An accident. Yeah. Locke. We should think about this. All right. Maybe this isn't the best way. lt's the only way, Jack. - How many do we need to blow the hatch? - Two should take care of the hinge. - Three to be safe. - Safe. [scoffs] l'm removing the driest pieces to minimize our risk transporting it. You ever play Operation? Sure. ''Don't touch the sides.'' l... l always... ...got nailed... ...on the funny bone. Bzzzz! You like to play games, John? Absolutely. [Charlie] Okay. l know we're in a rush to escape to the caves, so l've solved the Turnip-Head transport issue. This is, uh, just a blanket from the plane. And then, this piece of wood here that goes through this bamboo. Here you go. lt's a Björn. - A Björn? - Björn. lt's... ...Dutch for, uh, baby carrier. Yeah. Thanks. - Well, that's okay. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Oh! That's okay. Let's put him there. - lt's really... - [Rousseau] Sayid! - Where is he? - What...? - Sayid, where is he? - He already left. - l need him now! - Jack and Kate? There's no time! Where is Sayid? All right, just calm down. l'll get him for you. - Stay here, all right? - Okay. That's okay. [Charlie] Sayid! Sayid! What happened out there? [baby cooing] What is his name? Your child. What is his name? Oh, l haven't named him yet. May l hold him? Um, why do you need Sayid? You don't want me to hold him? [stammering] No, l just fed him. l don't think it's a good idea. Okay? - Please! - [baby crying] [screaming] When did l do that? Why did l scratch you? - What's going on? - Uh... My flight. l, uh... My flight to LA leaves in a couple of hours, so you gotta get moving, you know? Uh... You wanna do one more bump for the road? lt's all gone. We did it all last night. l got some champagne. - You gotta have some left. - Mm-mm. Nope. lt's done. l'll look you up next time l'm in Sydney, okay. l'll, uh, send you an autographed copy of, uh, my CD, then you can listen when you want. l don't want your crap CD from your crap band. Last night in the bar, you said you were a fan. Fine. l'm a huge fan. Drive Thru is the best damn band ever. Now just gimme a bump, 'cause l know you got some. Shaft. Drive Shaft. What's that in your hand? Nothing. - Holding out on me? - l'm not holding out. - Give it to me. - What? - l'm not holding. - Give it. l got nothing in my hand! Get off! Get up! - Get off! - Get up! Let it go. Let it go! - What are you, crazy? - Let it go! - Get off! - Let it go! - [girl screaming] - Get off! Get off me! Ow! [grunting] You're pathetic. You're pathetic! [door slams] Sayid! Sayid! Rousseau's on the beach. She needs you. - Rousseau? What for? - l don't know. [Sun] Help! Help! Help! Someone! Help! - Oh, my God. - Help! - [Sayid] What happened? - Her head. - [Claire] Where's my baby? - Oh, my God. ls he all right? - [Sayid] Rousseau. Was she alone? - Did she take my baby? Which way did she go? l don't know! She took my baby! This is your fault! You brought her into the camp! lf you had given me a gun. . . Do not hit me again. You want to waste time assigning blame? There's plenty to go around. She has a head start. lf we leave now, we can catch her. How we gonna do that? Because l know where she's going. - [Sun] Please now... - l want my baby. l can carry all the sticks in my pack. The more insulation we stuff in, the better. l think we should split 'em up. What? lt's not smart to keep it all together, so we split 'em up. lf we need three sticks to blow the hinge, then we should bring six. Three and three. A fail-safe. ln case one of us... You and me then. No. l'm taking one. Not gonna happen. This is why l came. - You wasted a trip. - l need to do this. Kate, no one owes anyone anything. - l'm carrying one. - We're done. - This is not your decision. - lt is. We'll draw straws. They're coming. We don't have time to argue about who risks their life, so... - ...we let fate decide. - Works for me. - What about you? - You wanna carry some dynamite? What? You got some... Arnzt on you. Short sticks carry the packs. Looks like it's you and me, Kate. So, what's this stuff even do? Well, the transmitter sends out an SOS in case someone's listening. And if there's anything out there, we'll see it on this radar screen here. Here we go. - Come on. - [beeping] [Michael] Someone, find us. Those are messages everybody wrote. Sure are. They're private. Yep. l for one never knew how much Tracey missed her hubby and two kids back in Fresno. Yet she's sleeping next to good ol' Scott to keep her warm at night. That's Steve. Scott's dead. Whatever. Long ride, Kazoo. We gotta keep ourselves entertained. Who the hell is Hugo and how's he got a hundred and sixty million dollars to leave to his mom? How'd you like it if l read yours? You can't 'cause l didn't write one. Why not? 'Cause the only letter l ever wrote is to the man l'm gonna kill. - Why you gonna kill him? - 'Cause l need to. - Why? - Because. [Charlie] Are you bloody joking? Why would she go for the black smoke? lsn't that where the others are? The others are why she would go there. Rousseau told us she saw black smoke the day her own child was taken 1 6 years ago. They took something from her. And now she believes... she has something they want. - She's making a trade? - l believe she is. Yes. That's insane. She's insane. Don't apply reason to her actions. She's a mother who lost her child. Just like Claire. This isn't about revenge. Don't make it personal. [shouting] l'm coming with you. That's not a good idea. This is my baby, okay. l let her take him. - Claire, listen. - Don't tell me what to do! Calm down. [sobbing] l am coming with you. This is my fault and l'm coming and you can't stop me! lt's fine, all right. lt's all right. [sobbing] l'm supposed to raise him. Get him back, Charlie. Get Aaron back. Aaron? Please. Get him back. Please. Claire, l will get him back. Promise. [PA announcer] Hey, you want something to eat? [video game beeping] l guess that's a ''no'' then. lf you're worried about Vincent, he's gonna be okay, man. Dogs fly in the luggage compartment all the time. All right. l gotta call work. Right over there. Don't go anywhere, okay? No, l live in a studio apartment. l gotta be out the door in the morning for work by 5am. Who's gonna watch him? How's he getting to school? What about after? l can't do this, Ma. You know, l was... Listen, l was thinking, um... l was thinking maybe you could take him. But Ma, if it's a question of money, l... [sighs] What am l supposed to do with him? He's not supposed to be mine. This was never part of the plan. Yeah, l... Thanks, Ma. Hey, man. - l was, uh... - l need new batteries. Hey. - You wanna try? - What? Come on, come here. - You drive for awhile. - Really? Absolutely. Okay, now. Look. The most important part of this boat is the rudder. lt's how you steer. You turn it gradually. Nothing sharp, okay? Push it this way. Where are we going? Look. So we're going approximately north by northeast. So hopefully that puts us into a shipping lane. Or we hit some land. What do l aim for? See that cloud on the horizon? - Right there? - Yeah. You aim for that. Yep. - Okay. - Got it. How come you and my mom didn't stay together? We tried. lt just didn't work out. So our lives, our interests just went in different directions. How come l never saw you? 'Cause your mom didn't want me to. She did what she thought was best. She was wrong. [crashing] - Rudder. - [Michael] Hey, we hit a log. - We lost the rudder. - [Jin] Rudder. Rudder. [Michael] We're losing it! lt's sinking! Stop the boat. Stop the boat! Just pull the sail down. Right. Dad! Sawyer! Sawyer! Give me the rope. Throw it. - Sawyer! - [Sawyer] lt's sinking. [Michael grunts] l can't reach it. [Jin speaks Korean] - Got it? - [speaking Korean] Tie it around the rudder and we'll pull you in! Okay. Michael. Michael. [speaks Korean] Got it. Come on. Come on, buddy. [panting] You just saved our ass, buddy. Here's your shirt. You should put that back on before you burn. Sorry. Yeah, well... lt's the luck of the draw. Sun sets in 90 minutes, give or take. lf we want to get back to the hatch, we have to hustle. Okay, this is how we do this. l'll lead. Kate, you're right behind me. Then Hurley. John, you bring up the rear. - lf you see me heading the wrong way... - We should stagger our formation. Keep a safe distance from each other. All right. We stagger. lf anyone hears anything or sees anything... Like the security system that eats people? Yeah. Like that. You two, you take your packs off, you put 'em down and you run. - You got it? - Got it. Yes, sir. Okay. Let's do this. [chattering] [Sun] He died bravely. What? Your brother. Yeah. Thanks. Do you think all this... ...all we've been through...? Do you think we're being punished? Punished for what? Things we did before. The secrets we kept. The lies we told. Who do you think is punishing us? Fate. [Claire] No one's punishing us. No such thing as fate. Are you okay? l'm fine. Keep going. [Sayid] We're losing the light. - Try to keep up. - l'm coming. Sayid! Sayid! Sayid! [Sayid] Over here. Sayid. You can barely breathe. We're going to rest. Rest? She's out there right now. ln another mile, you're going to collapse. We're going to take a break. ls this where Boone fell? The plane was up there. Where did it come from? Based on the maps inside, Nigeria. - Anyone onboard? - Two men, dressed as priests. - Priests? - Drug runners in disguise. The plane was loaded with heroin. All right. Now we go. [Hurley] So, dude, what do you think's inside that hatch thing? [Locke] What do you think's inside it? [Hurley] Stacks of TV dinners from the fifties or something. And TVs with cable. Some cell phones. Clean socks. Soap. Twinkies. You know, for dessert after the TV dinners. Twinkies keep for, like, 8,000 years, man. l like Twinkies too. Come on, really. What do you think's inside? Hope. l think hope's inside. [screeching] Whoever named this place Dark Territory, genius. [rattling] Yeah. l saw it. We gotta get out of here. [screeching] [fluttering] - [crashing] - [roaring] [snarling] Locke! What are you doing? Locke! Locke! [roaring] [roaring] [Jack] Locke! Locke! - Jack? - [screeching] Jack! - [rattling] - [grunts] Ahhh! [Jack] Locke! Ahh! [panting, straining] - Oh, my God. Locke! - l need the dynamite! No, no. lt's in my pack. Go get it! Hurry! Go! - John. John, just hold on. - Oh! - Just let me go. - What? - l'll be all right. - No! - Let me go! l'll be all right. - [Kate] l got it! l got it! [Jack] Be careful unwrapping it. [Kate] All right. - Now throw it in. - No! lt'll blow us up. - Do it! Hurry! l can't hold him. - Don't do this. - Throw it in. Now, Kate! - Ah! [explosion] [humming] [grunting] Hey. Your wife... wife made this for you? Sun. She sounded it out, huh? - So you can learn English. - Uh... Yes. Yeah, l wish she made one for me. So, what words are in here? English words. What can you say? Ah! Um... Starboard. Aft. Port. Uh... Sail. Uh... - Eat. - Yeah, right. She did you well. l hope you know how lucky you are, man. Back in business? Alrighty. Oh, hey, it's yours. [speaks Korean] - Here we are. - You. What? You. Um... Thank... you. Thanks. l made you some tea. l'm fine. Thanks. Aaron is a beautiful name. What does it mean? l don't know what Aaron means. - They will bring him back. - Don't say that. - They will. - How do you know that? Because he said he would. Charlie will bring your baby back. - There! - Charlie, wait! Charlie! Ah! See. Let me see. - [gasping] lt's bleeding. - We need to put pressure on it. Okay. Put pressure. - Ow! - There. - Animal! What is she...? Ow! - Keep the pressure on, like this! She's been here for 1 6 years. She's learned how to set traps quickly. Okay, let's have a look. lt's too deep. lt's bleeding too much. You have to go back. l'm not. You have to fix it. - l'm not a doctor. - You're a soldier! What do people do when they get wounded? l'm not going back without that baby, Sayid. Don't move. - Gunpowder? - Remove the towel, tilt your head back. Remove the towel. This is because l hit you, isn't it? [groaning] This is not going to be pleasant. You ready? One. Two. Three. [Charlie screaming] [snoring] [horn honking] Oh, man. l need my car. Twenty minutes? Look, l can't miss my flight. My mom's birthday's tomorrow. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Cool. Some of us have a bloody flight to make. Excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Come on. Come on. [mechanical rattling] No. No. No! No! [honking] Excuse me. Excuse me. Look out. Coming through. Excuse me. Excuse me. Look out! Excuse me. [over PA] Flight 9 1 7 is now boarding at gate 85. Flight 9 1 7 is now boarding at gate 85. Any way we can hurry that up? My mom's birthday's tomorrow. Or... today. l don't know, l don't really get the whole time change thing, but l gotta make that flight. l am going as fast as the system will allow me, dear. You are confirmed for seat 20-G. However, the airline has a policy that a man of your size must purchase two tickets. What? l didn't have to do that on the flight out here. Am l going to have to weigh you, dear? Fine. Whatever. l'll buy the one next to it. - Alrighty. Here's two together. - Book it. [over PA] Departure gate for flight 1 43 has been changed... [agent] Uh-oh. ''Uh-oh''? What ''uh-oh''? lt appears that your flight is already boarding in the international terminal. This is the domestic terminal. l don't think you're meant to make this flight, dear. Sorry. Pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry. [grunts] Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me! Coming through. Behind you. Look out! Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry! Sorry, this is an emergency. l gotta... l gotta cut through. Excuse me. Dude. Dude. - Back of the line. - Let me go ahead. l'm gonna miss my... - You don't understand. This is... - Back of the line. [man] Next. Now? You're taking the computer out now? Hey! Old guy! l'll give you 500 to borrow your scooter. l just had a hip replacement. l need this. Okay. Sixteen hundred bucks. Excuse me. Excuse me. Whoa! Coming through! Look out. Look out, look out. Coming through. Excuse me. Excuse me. Look out. Heads up. Coming through. Look out. Coming through. Coming through. Konnichiwa. Excuse me. Yeah, coming through. Look out! Look out! Hey! Hold it! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold... Hold the door! [panting] l gotta get on... this flight! - Sir, the Jetway's closed. - Please. For the love of all that is good and holy in the world, let me on this plane. All right, one second. Hunter? This is Gina. We've got one more. Ta. This is your lucky day. [squealing] [Hurley repeating] Fifteen, 1 6, 23, 42, four. You say something? Nope. l thought l heard 23. Does that mean something to you? - What? - That number? 23? The guy who called the feds on me back in Australia did it for a $23,000 reward. Mean something to you? Nah. lt's just a number. Better catch up. l can barely see 'em. We shouldn't be this close to each other, Jack. lf we blow up, we blow up. What the hell was all that about back there? - What was what about? - You asked to let you go. That's right. That thing was taking you down the hole. - lt wasn't gonna hurt me. - lt was gonna kill you. l seriously doubt that. Look, l need for you to... l need for you to explain to me what the hell's going on inside your head. l need to know why you believe that thing wasn't gonna... - l believe that l was being tested. - Tested. Yeah. Tested. l think that's why you and l don't see eye to eye sometimes, Jack. - Because you're a man of science. - Yeah. - And what does that make you? - Me? Well, l'm a man of faith. Do you really think all this is an accident? That we, a group of strangers, survived. Many of us with just superficial injuries. You think we crashed on this place by coincidence? Especially this place. We were brought here for a purpose. For a reason. All of us. Each one of us was brought here for a reason. Brought here? And who brought us here, John? The island. The island brought us here. This is no ordinary place. You've seen that, l know you have. The island chose you too, Jack. lt's destiny. Did you talk with Boone about destiny, John? Boone was a sacrifice that the island demanded. What happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events that led us here, that led us down a path, that led you and me to this day, to right now. And where's that path end, John? The path ends at the hatch. The hatch, Jack. All of it. All of it happened so we can open the hatch. No. No, we're opening the hatch so that we can survive. Survival is all relative, Jack. [sighs] l don't believe in destiny. Yes, you do. You just don't know it yet. - l turned it on a little while ago. - Sayid said every hour. Look, we're 1 5 miles out. We could be here for weeks. - lf that battery runs out... - The man said every hour. [beeping] - Nothing. - Five minutes. No more. Aye, aye. Know what l like about you, Mike? You got the patience of a saint. Yeah? Why you say that? l've seen the way he talks to you. The way he runs around, does whatever the hell he wants. l'd have shown him the back of my hand a long time ago. - You would, huh? - Hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink. ls that what your father did to you? Show you the back of his hand? My daddy never got a chance to beat me. Shot himself when l was eight. That why you wanna die? What? Since you told me you wanted on this raft, l couldn't figure it out. Why's a guy who only cares about himself wanna risk his life to save everyone else? Way l see it, there's only two choices. You're either a hero, or you wanna die. Well... l ain't no hero, Mike. [beeping] That what l think it is? Something's out there. [beeping continues] l'm sorry, sir, but the special wheelchair that we use for loading disabled passengers, no one seems to know where it is right now, and unless we find it, l'm not sure we can get you on. There's not another flight till tomorrow. l'm aware, but there's nothing l can do. Look, l can get Michelle. We can carry him on. Mind if we carry you on? [sighs] No, that would be fine. Here we go. Here's your seat. [man] l'll get your bags, sir. lf you need anything, press the ''call'' button. Okay. Thank you. [Locke] Hugo, take these extra sticks back a couple hundred yards. Me? Oh, okay. Got it. Be careful. Can l have a flashlight? 'Cause, uh, the torch around the dynamite thing, not making sense to me. Kate, you run the fuse. - Jack and l will rig the charges. - Okay. What the hell is that? There's no footprints, no tracks. This is it? This is the black smoke? - Where are they? - l don't know. [baby crying] She's here. Danielle? - You come out! Right now! - Calm down. [whimpering] Danielle, l can hear you. Come out. Please. He needs his mother. - They were not here. - [Sayid] Danielle, you have to give us the baby. l just wanted my Alex back. l thought if l gave them the baby... lt's okay. l know. lt's okay. l got him. There never were any others. You started the fires yourself! No. l heard them whispering. You're a nut job. You heard nothing. l heard them say they were coming for the child. The others said they were coming for the boy. You're pathetic. Wire. Hold that end. Now the fuse. l'll do it. - That's as far as it goes. - lt's far enough. l'll light it. You take cover. There'll be enough burn time for me to get clear. - Hurley! - [Hurley] Wait. Just a sec. What was that about back there? What was what about? Putting the dynamite in your pack. - l made a judgment call. - We drew straws. l'm not gonna let drawing straws make decisions like that. You had no right. Everybody wants me to be a leader till l make a decision they don't like. You want to keep second guessing me? That's your call.
