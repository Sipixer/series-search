- No. No thanks, Locke. l'm gonna stay in today. [Locke] Come on. Fresh air will do you good. [Kate] l take better pictures than that. Smaller too, if you want something for your wallet. l just came by for a few things and this was. . . This was with my stuff. So you're not staying? Call me a broken record, but caves are natural shelter. And a hell of a lot safer than living on the beach. - You're mad at me. - No. Kate, l'm. . . l just don't understand why you won't come with me. Us. lt's maybe a mile up there. lf that. - l'm not setting up house here. - l want off this island too, but we know that's not gonna happen soon. Sayid has a plan. To find the source of the distress code. The signal's coming from the island. The signal has been running on a loop for 1 6 years, Kate. And the woman that left it, she wasn't rescued. What makes you think it'll be any different? l believe it. l wish l shared your faith. l wouldn't mind sharing a few things with her myself. What do you want, Sawyer? Heard the doc here was vacating the premises. Thought l'd lay claims to my new digs before somebody else. l could fix this place up. Might find somebody to share it with. l'll talk to you later. [insects chirping, birds calling] [snorting, rustling] Locke? [snorting] ls that you? [loud squealing] [Charlie] Bless me, Father, for l have sinned. lt's been a week since my last confession. Go ahead, my son. Last night, l had physical relations with a girl l didn't even know. l see. - Anything else? - Yeah. Right after that l had. . . ...relations with another girl. Then straight after that, l watched while they had... ...relations with each other. You see, it's my band, Father. Drive Shaft. We've been playing the clubs in Manchester and we've been getting some heat. A following, you know, and... The girls. . . There's some real temptations that come with the territory... ...if you know what l mean. Well, we all have our temptations, but giving in to them, that's your choice. As we live our lives, it's really nothing but a series of choices, isn't it? Well, then l've made my choice. l have to quit the band. [church bells ringing] [tapping] And ''the meek shall inherit the earth.'' Liam, what are you doing? This is a church. - Get your boots off. - Relax, choir boy. l bring good tidings of great joy. We've just been signed. A recording contract. You're gonna be a rock god. [roaring, squealing] [squealing] Nice work, Charlie. You make excellent bait. l'm glad l could oblige. Now give me my bloody drugs. Did you hear what l said? l want my drugs back. l need them. Yet you gave them to me. And l bloody well regret it. l'm sick, man. Can't you see that? l think you're a lot stronger than you know, Charlie. And l'm gonna prove it to you. l'll let you ask me for your drugs three times. The third time, l'll give them to you. Now, just so we're clear. This is one. Why? Why? Why are you doing this? To torture me? Get rid of them and have done with it. lf l did that, you wouldn't have a choice. Having choices, making decisions based on more than instinct is the only thing that separates you from him. - [squealing] - [splattering] Three antennae. Three points of a triangle. One here on the beach. Another, Kate will position in the jungle, roughly two kilometers in. And the third, l'll take to high ground up there. lf the French transmission is coming from somewhere within our triangulation, l'll be able to locate the source. - But there are two complications. - Of course there are. The power cells l've grafted onto the antennas are dry. No telling how long they'll last. A minute. Maybe more. Maybe less. So we have to wait until we're in position. How are we gonna tell that we're in the right position? We have no way to communicate with each other. Bottle rockets? Thank God for firework smugglers. When l'm in position, l'll fire off my rocket. When you two see it, you fire yours. As soon as the last one has gone up, we'll all switch on our antennas. - You said two complications. - The battery in the transceiver's dead. Without the transceiver, all of this is for nothing. Something from a laptop would probably work, - but l've not found anything. - l think l might know where to look. You've been hoarding like a packrat, and you don't have a single laptop? We are testy. Still upset about your little breakup? You and Jacko. lt must be exhausting. - What's that? - Living like a parasite. Always taking, never giving. Boy, you got me pegged, don't you? l get it. You don't want off this island because there's nothing to go back for. Nobody you miss. And no one misses you. Oh, you're feeling sorry for me. l don't feel sorry for you. l pity you. [sighing] All you had to do was say please. [Hurley] What's in these things, cinder blocks? Packed everything l thought useful, without leaving the others short-handed. You guys need a hand? l used to lug the band's equipment before we had roadies, way back in the day. - Here, let me. . . - [Jack] No, Charlie. The zipper's. . . ...broken. - Sorry. l was trying to help. - l know. lt's okay. Hey, you wanna help me grab the rest of those bags? Oh, could l? What are you doing? Oh, uh... l have a. . . headache. Diazepam. lt's for anxiety. - l was looking for aspirin. - Pretty strong stuff for a headache. - Yeah, right. - Hey. - You okay? You're looking a little. . . - lt's nothing. lt's just a headache. Charlie, leave it. Go get some water. Maybe you're dehydrated. Charlie, l got it. Go take care of yourself, man. l don't need you right now. [church bells ringing] [Liam] Come on, Charlie-boy, we can't do this without you. You are bloody Drive Shaft. Watch the language. This is our shot at the big time. What? You don't want to be famous? lt's not about that. l only care about the music. Your music, your songs that got us signed. l'm just a clown with a pretty face that sings them. You wanna take away my chance to be somebody? Liam, it's not about you. lt's. . . l love the band. . . lt's not who l am. Sometimes l just get lost in it. Won't happen. l'll be there looking out for you. We'll look out for each other. What brothers do, right? Right? Wait, wait, wait. Just promise me one thing. lf things get too crazy, no matter what, if l say we're done, we walk away. - We walk away. - Liam, promise. We walk away. You're the rock god, baby brother. - You wanker! - [giggling] Oh! [speaking in Korean] Hey, dude, this yours? Oh, yeah. l play bass in Drive Shaft. l wrote a bunch of tunes on that. You All Everybody. Listen, man. Jack just wants you to find another place for it. He's moving supplies and says it's in the way. You know, a lot of people look up to me. - They respect me, and you... - Charlie. . . You treat me like a bloody child, some useless joke. - What? - ''Charlie's not good enough.'' - ''Charlie's in the way.'' - Let me look at you. You'll look out for me? We'll look out for each other. Calm down. You're not yourself right now. You don't know me! l'm a bloody rock god! [rumbling] Oh, no. Oh! [coughing] Charlie, where's Jack? Where's Jack? [Hurley] Jack! - Jack, can you hear me? - [Charlie] l don't know what happened. We were talking and it came down. - lt happened so fast. - [Hurley] We gotta get help. - Go down to the beach and get help! - Okay, l'm on it. And make sure you tell Kate! What we're doing, chasing some phantom distress signal, what are the odds of this working? No worse than the odds of us surviving that plane crash. - People survive crashes all the time. - Not like this one. The tail section broke off when we were still in the air. Our section cart-wheeled, and yet we escaped with nothing but a few scrapes. How do you explain that? Blind, dumb luck. No one's that lucky. We shouldn't have survived. Sorry, Sayid, but some things just happen. No rhyme, no reason. [Charlie] Hey! Hey! - We need help! - What's wrong, man? - lt's Jack. He's trapped. - What? - Our cave collapsed. We've got to go. - Hey, Scott? - l'm Steve. - l'm Scott. We got an emergency. Let's go. - We gotta go now. - [Michael] Come on, go. Come on, let's go. Shannon, you have to be ready to do something important. At 5<i>:</i>00 sharp, you need to be ready to turn that antenna on. - There's a switch at the base. - Why? Kate and Sayid are triangulating the French signal, but the antenna's power is really weak, so you have to wait until they fire their bottle rockets. Then you fire this one, then you turn on the antenna. Got it? - The switch is where now? - Did you hear a word l said? - Can you or can't you do it? - Yeah, l can. Okay, okay. Wait. Kate. - Hey, we have to tell Kate about Jack. - Sorry, sport, you just missed her. Her and Muhammad headed into the woods. - Which way? - Don't sweat it, amigo. - l know which way they went. - But. . . l'll tell her. You just keep doing whatever it is you do around here. - [cheering] - [rock music plays] ~ <i>You all everybody</i> ~ <i>You all everybody</i> ~ <i>Acting like you're stupid people</i> ~ <i>Wearing expensive clothes</i> ~ <i>You all everybody</i> ~ <i>You all everybody</i> ~ <i>You all everybody</i> ~ [cheering] All right! All right, all right. [Liam] Hey, mate. Thanks for coming in. - [chattering] - [rap music playing] What the hell was that? Another kick-ass show. You were bloody brilliant. l sing the chorus to <i>You All Everybody.</i> Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. l got caught up in the moment. Like the crowd wanted it, you know. l know, but if l start and then you come in after. . . She's cool. Let her in. lt won't happen again. l promise. Hello, lovely. Chill, baby brother. - Hey. Hey, wait! - Jack's in there. Let me check it out before you move things. - lf it's unstable... - How do you know? Eight years of construction work. l don't want you near the rocks. - Take the dog. - You should get Mr. Locke. Locke's in the jungle killing stuff. Who knows where he is. All right. This area here is load bearing. We gotta dig where there's no danger of the wall buckling in. All right, here. We dig in here so the wall doesn't collapse. Four at a time, by hand, till we can find some kind of shovel. We take shifts and go slow. Whoever isn't digging should be clearing the rocks and bringing water to who is working. Okay? Let's move. [birds calling] Hey. What the hell are you doing here? Easy. l just came to tell you something. What makes you think l'm interested in anything you have to say? You were right about me. That l don't help anyone but myself. Well, here l am. Ready to pitch in. You're here to help? Hey, you act any more surprised, l'm gonna get offended. [flies buzzing] Something wrong, Charlie? Yeah. Jack. He's. . . There's been an accident in the caves. Jack's trapped in a cave-in. - ls anyone trying to get him out? - There's a bunch of people there now. And why aren't you with them? You didn't come to tell me about Jack, did you? l want my stash, Locke. l can't stand feeling like this. Come here. Let me show you something. What do you suppose is in that cocoon, Charlie? l don't know. A butterfly, l guess. lt's much more beautiful than that. That's a moth cocoon. lt's ironic. Butterflies get all the attention. But moths, they spin silk. - They're stronger, faster... - That's wonderful, but. . . You see this little hole? This moth's just about to emerge. lt's in there right now, struggling. lt's digging its way through the thick hide of the cocoon. Now, l could help it. Take my knife, gently widen the opening, and the moth would be free. But it would be too weak to survive. The struggle is nature's way of strengthening it. Now, this is the second time you've asked me for your drugs back. Ask me again and it's yours. [man] Keep going. Keep going. [straining] We're through. We got a hole. Jack! Jack! Can you hear me, Jack? Come on, dude, answer me. - [Jack] Oh! - l hear him! - He's alive. - Jack, bro, you okay? [Jack] l'm pinned. l can't move. [gasping] [Jack] l can't move. What do we do? How do we get him out? - Charlie was with me. - He's okay. He made it out. - Listen, Jack? - Yeah? We're gonna get you out of there, okay? [moaning] We'll place the second antenna here. You want to help? Attach this antenna up in that tree. As high up as you can. Golly, thanks, boss. Five o'clock. Watch for my flare. Then it's your turn. l don't trust him. Who does? l don't trust him with you. l can handle him. Okay. We can't safely make that tunnel any bigger. But since Jack can't get out, one of us is gonna have to go in and unpin him. - Crawl through that? - He means someone smaller. [speaking in Korean] Dude, we don't understand Chinese. Korean, man. - They're Korean. - [Charlie] l'll do it. Charlie? No, man. You're still too shook up. - l might be able to squeeze. . . - Wait. Who's gonna take care of your son if something happens? She's got a husband. He's got a sister. l'm alone here. No one on the island. Let me do this. Still ain't five, just like the last time you checked. l don't want to miss Sayid's signal. l'll fire the flare, you set off the antenna. l just thank the good Lord l got you here to keep reminding me. lt's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it. So, what is it about that guy? Jack. What is it about him that makes you all weak in the loins? Do you try to be a pig or does it just come naturally? lt's that he's a doctor, right? Yeah, ladies dig the doctors. Hell, give me a couple of Band-Aids, a bottle of peroxide, l could run this island too. You're actually comparing yourself to Jack? The difference between us ain't that big, sweetheart. l guarantee you if he had survived a few more weeks on this island, you'd have figured that out. What did you just say? Ah, damn. Didn't l tell you? Word from the valley is Saint Jack got himself buried in a cave-in. - What? - Look at the bright side, now you have someone else to pity. [Michael] Listen, man. Go slow, all right? Try not to nudge any of the rocks around you. - Anything else? - Yeah. Good luck. - Be safe, man. - Good luck, Charlie. All right. Thanks, guys. [cameras clicking] [crowd chanting] [crowd] Drive Shaft! Drive Shaft! Drive Shaft! [Liam] Everybody wants a piece. Everybody wants more. Everybody wants another piece. They can't leave you alone when you're on top... Bloody hell. Hey, baby brother. Grab a bird and sit down. Get out. You too, get out. - Out! - Out? Come on. Now! Come back in five minutes. Sound check. You missed sound check. You don't show up for rehearsal. We've got a show in an hour. Ooh! A show. l like shows. Oh, yeah. All right. That's it. After tonight, we cancel the rest of the tour. - What? - We walk away. Are you off your head? Like we said we would if things got. . . Walk away and go where? You're killing yourself with this junk. You're destroying Drive Shaft. l am Drive Shaft! No one even knows who the sodding bass player is. This is it, Charlie. End of the rainbow. You really think you can walk away? Then what, eh? Face it. lf you're not in this band, what the bloody hell use are you? - Liam. - Piss off! - [panting] - [rumbling] Charlie? Charlie, move! Charlie! [coughing] l'm, uh... l'm here to rescue you. - We try again. - We can't leave them. - They're gonna run out of air. - Stop talking. l'm trying to think. Where is he? - Where is he? - [Michael] Kate. Where is he? Where's Jack? He's in there. Does anyone know if he's alive? - ls he alive? - We don't know. Charlie went in there through a tunnel that we dug. But it collapsed. Why is nobody digging? - [chattering] - [straining] Give it to me. Give it to me. Okay. One, two... [straining] ...three! - Oh! - Sorry, Jack. Sorry. You all right? - My shoulder's dislocated. - What? - You're gonna have to pop it back in. - No, l can't. - l need your help. - l can't do it. - Yes, you can. - l can't. Yes, you can. Okay. What do l... What do l do? - Take my hand. - This hand? Okay. Okay, wait. Okay. Now, when l tell you to, pull as hard as you possibly can. [stammering] l don't know if... You can do this, Charlie. Okay, okay, okay. Now. [cries out in pain] [jingling] Charlie. What are you doing here? A bloke can't pay his big brother a visit? Of course you can. Why didn't you call, you lunatic? What are you doing in Sydney? lt's all lined up, Liam. Eight weeks on tour, opening for some band called Meat Coat. First gig's in Los Angeles. LA, Liam. This is a chance to get back on a label. A real one. This is our comeback. Charlie, l don't want to come back. Yeah. Right. Well... Here's the thing. They won't book Drive Shaft without you. So, l'm asking. . . ...as a brother. . . ...the way you asked me. You were with me the night l missed Megan's birth. You were the one l was stumbling around Dresden with trying to find a fix. - You're still using, aren't you? - Don't change the subject. That's why you haven't returned my calls. - You gonna do this tour? - You said you'd get help. l lost your number. - You're still a junkie. - You did this to me! lt was about the music. Music, Liam. You took that away from me. Listen. Why don't you stay with us for a few weeks? Karen and me, we can get you help. - Sydney's got really good programs. . . - Forget it. Don't go. - Thanks for your help. - Stay. Please. - l was just looking out for you. - You never looked out for me. [dog barking] l have a plane to catch. How long has it been? l don't know what you're going on about. How long since your last fix? [sighs] Almost a day and a half. How's the withdrawal treating you? Any hallucinations? Apart from the conversation l had with you about an hour ago in the jungle. No, not really. Why didn't you say anything? l could've helped you through this. Yeah. You thinking l'm useless and a junkie to boot. Useless? You're not useless. That took a lot of guts getting in here and trying to rescue me. l won't forget that. For the rest of our lives? At the rate we're using our oxygen in here, that won't be too long. This place reminds me of confession. Those little claustrophobic booths. l wouldn't have taken you for a religious man. l used to be. You want to hear my confession? lt might take a while. Hey, l'm no saint, either. [fluttering] What's wrong? - lt's a moth. - A what? Right behind you. There's a bloody moth in here. Look. Charlie, what are you doing? Kate, you need to take a break. l'm fine. We've got enough people to dig. You keep going at this pace, you're gonna kill yourself. There's light. - What? - l can see light. [straining] [grunting, rocks falling] - [dog barking] - Hey, it's the doctor! Oh! Ow! Easy. [chuckling] My shoulder, careful. - How did you get out? - Charlie. - Charlie found a way out. - Dude, you rock. You okay? [chuckling] - [man] Nice work. - You did it. Thanks. Thank you. [whispers prayer] All right, everyone. Now it's your turn. - We're in Malibu part of the year, - [explosion] but the guys there are such idiots... Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Come on, Kate. Come on. One more. One more. Come on, Kate. Come on. Yes. Yes. Where are you? [static] Yes! Where are you? Where are you? Dude, you feeling okay? - You look a little... - Flu. - He's got the flu. - Oh, man, that's rough. After all you've been through. Take it easy, man. l think l'm gonna stretch my legs. [straining] This place is cool. Can we live here? Made you something. Aw. My very first sling. How's that? Good. Thank you. So these are the safe caves you've been going on about. This was a fluke. Michael checked out the integrity of the rest, gave them an okay. - You're headed back to the beach, huh? - Sayid should be back by now, and if his plan worked, then... Then we're one step closer to getting off this island. Thanks for the sling, Kate. You're welcome. Give them to me. This is the third time. - Are you sure you really want it? - l've made my choice.
