Previously on Fringe... This technology has a very recognizable design. This is William's technology, but we didn't build it. Peter is in danger. You have to help us cross over. We don't have a way to cross over, but you do. We made it. We're on the other side. Peter, I've missed you so much. Your father's so pleased to see you. He asked me to give you this. This is your team? Agents Francis and Dunham. I understand you're investigating a fringe event. - That's correct, sir. - I have reason to believe that these invaders are anything but peaceful. They must be found. Run, run, run! Hello, Olivia. Walter is in trouble, and I'm quite confident... we don't have much time. The grand hotel, designed by Antonio Gaudi. Built in 1908.</i> The long island triangle. Fringe event 2461.</i> A semi-permanent thin spot formed in 1990.</i> Temporal and spatial distortions are present.</i> This area is off-limits. Midtown quarantine. Fringe event 89722.</i> An unstable wormhole at the Madison square garden</i> that would not close was quarantined by Fringe division in 1999.</i> Due to recent legal developments, the 10,000 citizens encased in quarantine amber</i> have been recently ruled legally dead.</i> Liberty island. Appropriated by the revised eminent domain provision</i> of the Earth Protection Act in 1989, now headquarters of the department of defense.</i> Mr. Secretary. - You said anything odd, sir. - Yes. Sir, Homeland Security received a report of a high-priority individual being admitted into the ER at New York general hospital. Who? That's the odd part, sir. It's you. It's Sunday. Day off. Afraid not. I'm uploading your assignment now. Team's on the way. We'll get them, sir, quickly and quietly.</i> Mr. Secretary. Hello, son. I've imagined this moment so many times. I can't imagine how strange it must be for you. I've seen the strange. But this... This is something else. This is the last hospital before the park. If we don't find Walter here, we'll start heading uptown. How do you know that he's not already in custody? I've checked with Homeland Security. I don't believe Walternate's people have found him yet. - "Walternate"? - A nickname Walter gave him years ago. "Walternate." Over here, he's the secretary of defense. - The fringe team answers to him. - To Walter? I know it takes a little getting used to, doesn't it? - Excuse me. - How big were the bees? This big? - Bigger than a grapefruit? - Excuse me... Hey, pal! If you ain't bleeding, back of the line. Excuse me, sir, I didn't realize. That's quite all right. I believe a friend of mine is being treated here. - What's the patient's name, please? - Bell. Sir? You go. I'll buy you some time. You find Walter. I'll meet you in the parking lot. I'm sorry. A misunderstanding. Give me a second. I'll find him for you. We're also gonna need his medical files purged from the system. Fringe authorization. I purged his file. He's in bed 18. Thanks. Excuse me, excuse me. Don't I know you from somewhere? I have it. You're agents. Fringe division. You work for the Secretary. - Sorry, we're in a bit of a rush. - I'd imagine you would be. Chaotic times, aren't they? Chaotic times indeed. I'm terribly sorry. The secretary and I are old friends. I'm William Bell. I see you're carrying 76 pulse side arms. - I designed those, you know. - I'm sorry, Mr. Bell, but we have to... The 76 models don't have the phase repeater. That's a design flaw. It is you, isn't it? Yes, Walter. - Prove it. - Come on. We don't have time for this. Yes, it is you. That's wonderful. Hi. Hi. They also don't have the pulse function. Which I am putting in the 77. Excuse me, sir. Walter, can you walk? I can dance, if you like. They have absolutely fabulous drugs here, Olivia. I feel great. And look, look. Accelerated healing techniques. It's miraculous. Okay, come on, Walter. Bell's waiting for us. - Bell is here? - Yes. Yes, he is. That's nice of him to finally show up. Here. Clothes are gone. He was wounded. - I'll lock down the hospital. - You looking for something? I need the security footage for this unit. Now. - Hello, William. - Walter. - I see you've aged. - It appears I'm not the only one. Get in. You okay? Looks like you just saw a ghost. _.•´¯¯LIAISON¯¯`•. _ ¯`•. __Team__.•´¯</i> Retrouvez-nous chaque semaine... pour découvrir les énigmes de Saison 2 Épisode 23 - Over There, Part 2 -</i> Bon épisode... Thank you. - What's the red? - That's the quarantine areas. Boston? Most all of them. Because of what that man did. The man who stole you. That's a lot of blame to place on just one man. It's true, I'm afraid. When our two universes first interacted, it caused soft spots on the other side. But it was much worse here. The laws of physics were turned into mere suggestions. But I'm hoping you can change all that. I don't know what you heard about me, but... changing the laws of physics might be slightly above my abilities. That's fair enough. But there have been breakthroughs on the the other side in science and engineering that... that we haven't achieved yet. And these are things that you understand. The schematic I left with your mother... Yeah, I looked at them, and... Whatever it is, it's unlike anything I've ever seen before. So what is it? It's very old tech. It's something that... I believe can be applied to heal the problems of this world... of your world. I've... replaced missing parts with new equipment, but, unfortunately, it still doesn't work. My engineers tell me that the problem probably lies in the power source. I was hoping that you would have a look at it. Of course I would. Peter, I know it wasn't easy... Making the choice to come home. But I'm very glad you did. Sir, Agent Dunham is here. She doesn't have an appointment. - Tell her... - Olivia's here? Send her in. Agent Dunham. - Sir. - This is Peter. Thank you, major. Do I have something in my teeth? No, you remind me of somebody I know. But your hair is different. Think I like yours better. Would you excuse us, please, Peter? I need to speak to Agent Dunham. I'll be out in a moment to show you around. Agent. We lost him at the hospital, sir. - We think he had help escaping. - That's not why you're here, is it? No, it is not. I told you there would be invaders coming over from the other side, but I didn't tell you they would be us. No, you did not. They're our doubles, Alternate versions of ourselves, but don't be deceived, Olivia. They're monsters in our skin. They'll do and say anything to gain our trust, but they can't be trusted. That man. He knows me. Or her. That's why he was staring at me. Is he from the other side? That man... Is my son. Your son who was kidnapped 20 years ago? Yes. Kidnapped by them. May I ask a favor of you? They had cameras everywhere. We must be on the hospital surveillance tapes. Which means we are fugitives. Double breaded for a big crunch. It's so good. Tastes just like on our side. It was Wednesday, 1983, when I happened to identify the last of the 11 secret herbs and spices. I think that we should split up. I can look for Peter faster - if I'm on my own. - We have a larger problem. Without Mr. Lane and the others, we won't be able to cross back to our side. Olivia can still open the door. That's her gift, is it not? I don't know how much of a toll crossing over took on her. You may be able to open a crack, but without the others to enhance your power... - That's it, then. - What? We need a doorstop. Something to hold the door open Where Olivia has already provided a crack. - You could build one, Walter. - A doorstop! I'd need a particle accelerator. I don't think they exactly sell those - at the local drugstore. - No. But I think I know where we could get one. Of course. I'm sure you opened Massive Dynamic on this side as well. - As a matter of fact, I did not. - To get rich and famous while I was rotting away in a padded cell. Walter, will you please... Come on, you can work this out another time. You build a doorstop, if you can. I'm gonna go look for Peter. Do you have a cell phone? They monitor all the communications networks. That's probably how they knew about central park. It's safest if we don't try to communicate with one another. We'll meet back at the opera house in 12 hours. Be careful. We've accomplished a lot together, Walter. But she may be our greatest achievement. The secretary thinks you'll be comfortable here. Thanks. So, it's UV-proof glass. State-of-the-art anti-fire tech. There's viral purging, Air filtration, and there's a gym and a pool upstairs. The secretary's gonna send a car to pick you up at 8:00, take you to dinner. What was it like on the other side? Secretary told me. A lot like it is here. Just... slightly different. It's subtle, but definitely different. You know, when people find out that you're back... you're gonna be famous. What do you mean? Well, your kidnapping. It's a famous story. I'm like the Lindbergh baby? The what? Nothing. What's she like? Who? Me. She's a lot like you. Darker in the eyes, maybe. She's always trying to make up for something. Right some imaginary wrong. Haunted, I guess. Maybe she's nothing like you at all. Thanks for the ride. Of course. Am I responsible for this? Yes, Walter. I'm afraid you are. Of course. At one time, Walternate was intent on finding a means to cross between universes. Just as you were. He didn't succeed, but... it stands to reason the technology we need might be here. Didn't Walternate work with you? Or, rather, the William Bell from this side? Walternate? No. It seems that William Bell on this side was killed in a car accident as a young man. Over here... the other you and the other me never had occasion to meet. What a shame. Imagine how much money you could have made if there were two of you. Creating massive dynamic was not my idea, Walter. We both talked about borrowing this world's technologies to help our own. You didn't help the world, William. You helped yourself. You pilfered this world for profit. As a byproduct, yes. Let's remember, the only reason I came back over here was to prevent a war. And to stop a chain of events set into motion the day you stole Peter! A little truth, if you please. You say you want to prevent the war while you quietly fuel it. I know th you helped craft the shapeshifters. Your design signature is all over it. I had little choice. If I wanted to keep tabs on walternate, I had to remain valuable to him. I've lost... 17 years in a mental institution, William. 17 years! And even now, I'm... I'm still incomplete. I forget things. Names. Places. Connections that I used to be able to make so easily. They just... they just dangle, just outside of my reach. I know what you did to me. I know that you cut out pieces of my brain. - Walter... - What kind of man could do that? You robbed me of my memories of my wife, of my son, of my past! Walter! I believe you've found what we're looking for. We should get started. How did you... We both leave our hide-a-key in the same place. This should do. With some modifications, this should act as a doorstop. Yes. Now, we need to simultaneously amply and limit the molecular destabilization margins. Well, we should try not to electrocute everyone in the process. Well... This will reopen the crack in the door. But without the others, I'm not sure that Olivia will be strong enough to keep it open. Well... Leave that to me. Now, I need your help. Well, you have a funny way of asking. Okay, I need you to take me to Peter bishop. I assume that you know where he is. Don't. It's getting heavy. Is that mom? Yeah. She's alive? What is she like? Well, the last few years have been hard for her my sister died during childbirth. You have a sister too? And a niece. Ella. She's seven. Ella. I need to speak to Peter bishop. He's in danger here, and he needs to understand that. This isn't just an assignment, is it? Are you two a couple? Is that what this is about... Please, I need to speak to him. You gotta trust me. I'm you. - You haven't answered my question. - What question? Why did you remove my memories? - I had my reasons. - Belly... Walter... Let the past be the past. We have less than four hours to get back. We should go. Will you help me? Stop. Stop. I was just getting my keys. Put it down. You keep your backup gun in your purse, don't you? I keep mine in my jacket. Now put your gun slowly down on the table. I thought we had an agreement. You know, I don't know what you are, but you are nothin' like me. You know, he was right. Call fringe. This is Dunham. Hey, Liv. I tried your cuff a couple of times. Everything okay? Yeah. What's up, Charlie? Got a power surge at the secretary's old lab. So Broyles wants us to go and check it out. You sure you're okay? The secretary just called. He wants us to move Peter bishop. - Apparently, he's not safe where he is. - They found Peter bishop? Yeah. Object is totally unresponsive. But there's nothing wrong with it. There's no... Obvious damage to the structure. And yet... Somehow it just feels incomplete. All right, this is gonna sound crazy. In fact... This is kind of crazy. But... what if... the object was symbiotic in nature? Which is to say that it wasn't entirely mechanical, that it needed some sort of... So sort organic interface? So how much do you know? How did they find him? I don't know. After all these years. Can you imagine when the tabloids get hold of this? You know, I think it has something to do with why these people have come from the other side. Yeah, I suppose so. - Have we got any new leads? - No, nothing new. I gotta tell you, Livvy, this job isn't what it was ten years ago. You got alternate universes. I an, it just... Just wasn't part of my training, you know? I mean, how are we supposed to fight these people? Truth is, Livvy, this makes me feel obsolete, you know? The parameters are human... a reflection of the human genome. The spectrum isn't random. In fact, the specificity of the configuration would seem to suggest that the object would only respond to a subset of people. And a narrow subset at that. A subset of one. Me. It's pleasure to meet you. Come on in. What can I do for you guys? - We're concerned for your safety. - What's this? This was given to me by an acquaintance of your father. An observer. An observer? He gave it to me, I think, to warm me about what would happen to you - if you ever returned here. - What's going on? He wants you to know that your friends are here and that they have come - to keep you safe. - What the hell are you talking about? - Peter, it's me. - Thanks, I think I just figured that out. He lied to me. He told me I could heal the problems of this world. My father told me that all the problems out there started when Walter came over and stole me. And that, now that I was back, I was gonna be able to help to fix it. But his bringing me back was never about fixing this universe. It was about destroying yours. I'm sorry. How long did you know? A few weeks. - Peter, I... - Don't worry. I'm not gonna let them do this. I don't think that he can. I mean, not without you. You don't belong here. No, I don't belong here. But I don't belong there, either. Yes, you do. I have thought of 100 reasons... why you should come back. To fight the shapeshifters, to take care of Walter, to save the world. But in the end... You have to come back. Because you belong with me. Colonel Broyles, listen up. I need everyone's attention, now! I want all surveillance retasked to find a fugitive. - What fugitive, sir? - Me. I've got her. Her show-me just passed the auto scan checkpoint at sector 47. They're heading back to the opera house. Let's move. This is not a drill. - They should be here by now. - They'll be here. Help me get this thing inside. I'm William bell. Haven't seen you in many years. You're holding up better than I would have thought. What's a little universe hopping between friends? That's not what I meant. Okay, so what do we do? Help your father get this device inside and powered up. Olivia and I will hold them off. I supplied Fringe Division with the 76 model. This is the 77. Come on. Peter, I don't even know where to begin. I never meant for any of this to happen. How do we do this, Walter? Phosphorous grenades. Be careful. They're prototypes, they could be unstable. - What do you mean, unstable? - Just try not to jostle them. Cover me. We move on my mark. Yes, Mr. Secretary. I understand. Damn it. Dr. Bell! Get down! Can you hear me? - Thank God. - What happened? I used a grenade. I think I bought us a few minutes. Come on. Walter, they're here. Is it working? Yes. It's opening a crack in the door, but we don't have enough power - to keep it open. - Yes, we can do it. We can't. Olivia doesn't have the power, and I haven't thought of a solution. Please don't argue with me, William! Always thinking you're smarter than me. I will be the power. I've traveled between universes so many times, my atoms are ready to split apart with the slightest provocation. You taught me there are as many atoms in the human body as there are stars in the sky. That's how many atom bombs I am. That should be enough power to get you home. I should never have doubted you. It's okay, Walter. You always were as stubborn as a donkey with a nail in his head. Walter, start the sequence. Thank you, old friend. You asked me why I took out part of your brain. I did it because you asked me to. Because of what you were becoming. Freeze! Welcome back. Seriously? This is the third piece, Astrid. Are you trying to kill me? I'm sorry. When I'm nervous, I cook. And I've been baking pies for about a week. Pies and muffins and cakes. And I've been eating them all too, so don't be surprised when I send you a bill for my lap band. I'm sorry I make you nervous. That's okay. At least you're back. You mind giving Walter a ride home? I think I'm gonna take a walk. Sure. Good night, Walter. You are back now, aren't you? You're not leaving again? I'm trying to see this your way, Walter. I can't. But... you did cross universes twice to save my life. So that's gotta count for something, right? Thank you, Peter. My son. Help you, gorgeous? I hope so. I'm looking for a typewriter. Well, you're in luck. A Selectric. Model 251. I see. It's in the back. Please let me out of here. I know you can hear me! Please... Please let me out of here. I know you can hear me! Please let me out of here! La <i>Liaison Team</i> vous remercie d'avoir suivi cette saison. Rendez-vous en septembre
