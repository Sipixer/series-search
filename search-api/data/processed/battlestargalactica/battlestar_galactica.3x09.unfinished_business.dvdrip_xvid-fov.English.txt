More than half the crew's down on New Caprica already. l'm not really doing too much up here any more. Good luck. Oh, my gods! It's a Cylon fleet. They found us. There's only one way that this mission ends, and that's with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica. - You brought them home, Saul. - Not all of them. - What about us? - There is no "us". There is nothing here. Do you get that? Nothing! Lee, when are you gonna get yourself a girl? - l'm doing fine, thank you. - You're not still frakking Dualla, are you? l am proud to serve with you, Lieutenant. And to call you my wife. l'm in a different place now. l just wanna hurt someone, and it might as well be you. (bell rings/horn blares) (shouting) - Come on! - <i>(man)</i> Come on, Helo! (cheering) That was exactly what l needed. Glad to be of service. (cheering) - Dammit. - Looking for this? Yeah. Kara, l want you back. l want our marriage back. l want a real marriage. And what if l'm just not ready for that? l don't know. Then l guess it'll never be. Maybe cos l'm not what you really want after all. l'm late for the dance. (distant cheering) Don't forget your boots on the way out, Sammy. (Kat) Get that right up, Lee! Come on! (bell rings/horn blares) - If it isn't the fighting Agathons, huh? - Starbuck. Late to the party as usual. At least l got here in time to see you kick the CAG's ass. (Kat) Lee, you've got him. You've just gotta keep your right up. He's a tough little frakker. He's fighting me like he's got it in for me. - <i>(Sharon)</i> Stay off the ropes. - <i>(Kat)</i> Stick and move. Stay off the ropes. - All right? You got him. - <i>(bell/horn)</i> (Kat) Come on, Lee! Kick his ass! You got him! You got him! Come on! (man) Helo! Come on, man! (Kat) Keep moving! Yeah! A few months ago, you would've had to roll him into this ring. Well, not any more. With a cooler head, he might have half a chance. - Come on! - You've got him, come on! (Tigh) Two. Three. Four. - Come on. - Five. Six. Seven. Hey, hey. Wait. (bell/horn) You did it, baby! Fischer! Fischer, you're up! Good fight. Bit off a little more than you can chew, huh? Come on, Lee. Don't be that way. Stick around. The night's young. Well, l guess you'll just have to enjoy it without me. Pulling your tags out so soon? l'm done, Kara. l'm not. Now who's biting off more than they can chew, Captain? Not me from where l'm standing, Major. Excuse me. l can't believe the progress they've made. You should've seen it a month ago. l'd still rather sleep in a warm bunk every night than muck around in... in this muck. Bunk's gonna be plenty warm tonight. - He said yes. - He approved the transfer? (Starbuck) You two just don't know when to keep a secret. So, are you guys here to see Baltar put a shovel in the ground? "Join the celebration as we break ground for a better tomorrow." - Aw, it's such a load of crap. - There's an open bar. Really? See, now why didn't you say so? Lee, you've gotta let your better half do the talking. She gets right to the point. Let's go find us a "better tomorrow". Excuse us. Didn't expect to find you playing in the sand. It's not sand. It's alluvial deposits. This used to be the river mouth. And you just had to take off your shoes and play in the alluvial deposits. How romantic. - That's a nice colour on you. - Thank you. It's good to see you, Laura. You too, Bill. - There you are. - Hey. How are you? My father was an avid fight fan. l adored my father, so l love a good fight. l heard about your so-called "dance". Accidentally, l might add. Don't take it personally. It's sort of a... private tradition. Tradition? (Adama) There's a lot of frustration aboard warships. Arguments become grudges, then end up being feuds. This allows them to let off some steam out in the open so everybody can participate. Rank doesn't matter. As long as you throw your tags in the box, everyone's fair game. (bell/horn) - <i>(man)</i> Come on! - Next up is Hotdog! Hotdog, get your butt up here and pick a partner. - Did you throw your tags in there? - <i>(laughs)</i> No. No. l wish. All the frustrations that l have... - <i>(Tigh)</i> Who's your partner, Hotdog? - Yeah! Starbuck. You've gotta be kidding me. (woman) Starbuck! (bell/horn) Go, Starbuck. He's yours. (woman) Get him, Starbuck! (bell/horn) (man) Come on, let's hear it! Way to go, Starbuck! (applause) (Baltar) Thank you. Let this day be remembered as the day we broke ground for our new tomorrow. (laughs) But no, it gets better, OK? Cos then they come back to the locker room with handcuffs and two straws! (cheering) Did l ever tell you how glad l am l married you? - Not once. - Oh. Well, then l'll save it for a special occasion. Come here. Come on! - Hi, honey. - Hey, baby. Hi. (giggles) We'll have the infrastructure to deal with any unforeseen... Excuse me. The finance minister just came by and l should... - Go ahead. - Thank you, sir. (laughs) Oh, my gods. l didn't think he'd ever leave. He's a good kid. Indeed. - You say this stuff grows around here? - Mm-hm. In the mountains north of here there's this little stream that comes down into a lake. The water is so clear it's like looking through glass. l'm thinking of building a cabin. It's good. It is good. That's a beautiful combination. - What did l miss? - Figurski, you done that bird already? No, the gyro's giving me trouble. Come on, Chief. l'm the only one over there. Frak it. Frak it, get yourself a drink. - Ship down, Chief? - Yeah, we'll get it tomorrow. Figured l'd give him a little R and R. Yeah! Congratulations. l may be jumping the gun, but first boy born on <i>Galactica.</i> That's the thing l want to talk to you about, sir. Um... Cally doesn't want him born here. And neither do I. Not if he has a chance to grow up breathing fresh air. What are you saying? Thank you. We both would like to request to be relieved of duty and settle on New Caprica. No. No way. Look, you're both here for the duration. (bell/horn) - What? - Can you hold these? Thank you. (shouting dies down) (man) Yeah! - Chief... - (crowd mutters) - Get your fat, lazy ass up here. - <i>(crowd cheers)</i> Helo. - Make them tight. - Yes, sir. He's an old man. l'll be fine. He's not serious, anyways. It's all on the admiral. Sure about this? It's your funeral. (man) Do it, buddy. (bell/horn) (crowd gasps) - <i>(man)</i> Did you see that? - Oh! Get up, Chief. We're just getting started. You know, l was thinking it's probably better to have the baby on the <i>Galactica.</i> You know, there's sickbay, doctors, medicine. Yeah. No, it'll be better. We'll be happier. Yeah. Come on, Admiral! - Hi, honey. - Hey, baby. Hi. (giggles) Is this really it, Bill? Is this how we're gonna spend all the rest of our days? Hm? (#jig) Maybe we should just enjoy this. l am. No, no. l mean enjoy being here on this planet as long as it lasts. l mean, maybe the Cylons come back, maybe they don't, but for now, right now... we've got a break. l've got people that wanna get off the ship... move down here. Can't say as l blame them. l mean, what are you gonna do? Is this how you fight your enemies, Chief? Is this how you fight for your life? No excuses. Show me you're a soldier. Get up! (applause/cheering) Come on! Nice, Admiral! Is that what you want? Is that what you want, Admiral? (Starbuck) Nice, Admiral! The old man's got chops. Knows when to make his moves, when to hold back. l wish l could say the same for his son. Come on! l bring offerings. Just in time. l was running on bingo fuel. Wow, look at that. You literally drank Anders under the table. - Where's Dee? - Oh, she packed it in to go pack. (sniggers) Guess it's just you and me, then. Yep. It's just you and me. Come on, Dad! - <i>(Tigh)</i> That's it. - <i>(bell/horn)</i> That's bad. That's enough, already. You should quit. Stop the blood. Coagulant for the swelling, ice for the bleeding. - Godsdammit. - You insist on doing this? You're crazy. - You wanna do this? - Yeah. Keep your guard up. He's coming in wild. Get him with a left hook. You wanna win? l'm not gonna win. You've gotta watch his jab. His jab's killing you. Just keep your eyes open. OK, you're looking good. Keep strong. Chief, good morning. Good morning, Cally. - Admiral. - l've been thinking about what you said. A battlestar's no place to raise a family. So l'm gonna miss you, Chief. l wanna wish you good luck. Thank you, sir. - My best to both of you. - You mean it? Really? Thank you. l want you guys to have at least a dozen. We'll see about that. - <i>(Starbuck)</i> Hang in there, Admiral. - <i>(man)</i> Get out of the corner! Come on! You've gotta move! (Tigh) Let's get you up. Come on, Bill. When you stand on this deck, you be ready to fight or you dishonour the reason why we're here. Now, remember this: when you fight a man, he's not your friend. Same goes when you lead men. l forgot that once. l let you get too close - all of you. l dropped my guard. l gave some of you breaks, let some of you go, before the fight was really over. l let this crew and this family... disband. And we paid the price in lives. That can't happen again. Figurski, you're with me. Let's get that bird back on the line. - Madam President. - Admiral. All right. This dance is over. Get your booze and your dog tags and let's get out of here. - So, what, you're just gonna call it? - Not enough excitement for you, Captain? (man) Yo, this is your beer, right? Hey. Hey! Where the frak do you think you're going? It's over, Kara. You have the guts to try and frak another man's woman, but not to fight one? l wonder if Dee knew what she was getting. Think she would've settled for sloppy seconds? Truth stings, don't it? You want a fight, Captain... you got it. - <i>(cheering)</i> - Yeah! (bell/horn) Oh, yeah! (giggles) Come on. You afraid to hit me? Or maybe you can't. Check it out. It's a great place for a house. - So you're really gonna give up flying? - Flying's gonna suck now, anyway. Lots of training, endless CAPs. The war's over. So is all the good stuff. Give me a tour... of the future life of Kara Anders. l'm not getting married. Well, then what's the point, Kara? l mean, you love him, right? Where are we going with this, Lee? Well, now, that's the question, isn't it? Where are we going? l mean, what if this is... this is it? The rest of your life, Kara. Is this how you wanna spend it? Is this who you wanna spend it with? - What's going on? - What's it look like? Looks like they're trying to kill each other. That's one perspective. Oh! <i>(giggles)</i> Well, that makes things more complicated. Yeah. What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? We accept it. Tomorrow, l tell Dee, you tell Sam. - Just like that? - Just like that. l don't know. Yeah, we tell them how we feel. We shout it to the skies. (laughs) Yeah, right. What? You... you don't think l will? Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Lee! <i>(giggles)</i> My name is Lee Adama! And l love Kara Thrace! (laughs) Calm down. It's not like anybody will hear. We're in your cabin in the forest, right? (giggles) l love Kara Thrace and l don't care who frakkin' knows! (laughs) Oh, Lee, you're crazy. Get down. Come on. l'm not gonna stop until you get up and do it, too. l can't. - OK, here we go again. Lee Adama! - OK, OK, OK. OK. (gasps) OK. Ka... Kara Thrace loves Lee Adama! Get up. Starbuck, get up. You can do this. Morning, Admiral. You look like you had a good time. Yeah, it was some party. It's been a hell of a morning, too. You missed all the excitement. - There's problems upstairs? - No. No, good things. Kara got married. You believe that? - What? - Yeah. About an hour ago. Found herself a priest, went down by the river, and got married. Are you OK? (Adama) Can you believe that? (chuckles) Well, she deserves it. We all deserve to be happy. l also gave her permission to muster out, along with Tyrol and Cally, and a few of the others. It'll be up to us to make sure there's no mass exodus. Hey, man. Did you hear the news? We're hitched. We got married! Can you believe it? No. No, l can't believe it. Yeah. You know, it was crazy. She comes and wakes me up, she pops the question, she drags me down to the priest, and bang, like that, we're married. So it was your idea? Yeah. It was my idea. Do you guys... do you guys want a minute to, uh... you know, talk? - Congratulations, Sam. - Yeah. And good luck. You're gonna need it. (man) That's it. (woman) Watch that pretty face! (man) Hey, come on. l'm outta here. (Starbuck) l've missed you. l missed... l missed you, too. - Jot this down.
