So what do you think we'll find? A beacon? A temple? A signpost to Earth? How many more jumps before we find the nebula? l'm estimating an even dozen. We're getting close. Still no sign of the Cylons. (Skulls) l didn't hear you say that... (radio static) - Go back. You almost had it. - <i>(Seelix)</i> Had what? That song. You don't hear that song? It's in the frakkin' ship! - This is my son. - l am very sorry, but l am not responsible. No. He's sick and l want you to bless him. Bless him? You are saying that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, ordered your execution and the execution of 200 other people? That's exactly what l'm saying. This is a death warrant. Have you seen the names on this list? Do you have... Gaius Baltar chose to side with the Cylons and to actively seek the deaths of his fellow citizens. Madam President, are you taking chamalla at this time? Don't answer. l'm putting a stop to this now. If she is on drugs, it goes to her credibility as a witness. l am taking chamalla again because my cancer has returned. l'm calling you a liar and a coward. And for what? The traitorous piece of garbage Gaius Baltar who doesn't even deserve a trial. l will not serve under a man who questions my integrity. And l won't have an officer under my command who doesn't have any. Argh! Frak me. (telephone buzzes) Yes? (Roslin) Yell at me. l don't wanna get out of bed. You've called the wrong number. l was thinking of going back to bed. - You feeling OK? - Says the cancer patient. Yeah, l'm fine. l just cut myself. How are you doing? l don't wanna face them. l don't wanna face any of them. l just wanna stay in bed all day and sleep. Uh, l think l stopped the bleeding. If you still need to be yelled at, l think l can give you some volume. OK. All right, give it your best shot. - Get out of that bed! - That's not your best shot. Get your fat, lazy ass out of that rack, Roslin! Yes, sir. OK, sir. Anything you say, sir. Thank you. Don't let them see you sweat, Laura. (man hums "All Along The Watchtower") (static) - Come here. - l can't. - Come here. - l've gotta go back to the <i>Colonial One.</i> You don't have to go anywhere. (static/haunting music) (static) What is that music? Gods! - What did you just say? - <i>(knock on door)</i> Frak. (knock on door) Yeah, l'm coming. - Hey. Why is the door locked? - Sorry. (distant music) (music grows louder) We should go for a mistrial. What? What's he talking about? What are you talking about? - Mistrial? Whatever for? - Because we're losing. Not from where l'm standing. We're actually doing quite well. We're about to break the prosecution. We've blown two key witnesses out of the water. What more do we need to do? Everyone in that courtroom hates you. Everyone. Including the judges. My father called you a traitorous piece of garbage who doesn't even deserve a trial. - He said that? He actually said that? - Yes, he did. And l don't think he's the only one up there. l agree. Our tactical victories are pissing them off. Right. So now, because we're winning, we're losing, actually? Perverse, isn't it? One of the reasons why l love what l do. "Forcing a mistrial may seem of little benefit to either side, but it can be a boon to the defence. The prosecution has shown their hand." "At retrial, the defence has the tactical advantages and the statistical chances of an acquittal rise by 25°/ª." - Joseph Adama. - <i>Trial Tactics and Strategies,</i> page 273. Smart man, your grandfather. - l can see why you'd want a mistrial. - Sorry? What's that supposed to mean? That would be the quickest way for you to absolve all your responsibility. You get back to your life, you get back to... wherever you get back to, and l get back to a cell and l have to go through this all over again. l can't physically take that. No more games. No mistrials. There will be a verdict. Yesterday marked a surprising turn of events in the trial of Dr Gaius Baltar, when Colonel Tigh admitted... Before any of you can think about flying my Raptors, you have to know systems. Electronics, avionics, navigation... - <i>(static)</i> - ...engine control, DRADIS configuration... - <i>(Chief hums "All Along The Watchtower")</i> - ...autopilot, and propulsion systems. (static) The best way to learn that is on a Raptor. That means getting your hands dirty. Come on. - <i>(Chief humming)</i> - Come on, come on, come on. - Chief? - Hey, Sam. (hums "All Along The Watchtower") That song you're humming. What is that? Oh. Uh... You know, l don't even know. It's just something l can't get out of my head. There must be some way out of here... l've been hearing that... everywhere. On a boom box. You know, in the bar? Come here. - You hear <i>that</i> song? - Yeah. And it's freaking me out. l hear it everywhere, but l can't really hear it. You know what l mean? Yeah. You can grab part of the melody and then it goes away? - Like it's something from child... - Childhood. - Exactly. - Yo, Anders! Do you need a frakking invitation? - Move it! - All right. No reason to get excited. (Cottle) Well, congratulations. You survived your first Doloxan treatment. Oh! Talk about the cure being worse than the disease. Next time bring some paperwork to help keep your mind off it. - It'll also help keep blood pressure down. - Yeah, right. - If you'll excuse me, l have other patients. - All right, go. Oh, gods! Argh. (Roslin) Hera! (both scream) (rapid beeping) (Cottle) What's going on? You're both freaking out at the same time? We need a moment. Take this off. Get this off me, please. Will somebody please tell me what the hell is going on? You can go outside. Thank you. We'll be fine. Shut the door. (guard) Yes, ma'am. (door closes) l'm sorry about the shackles. Were you with us a moment ago in the lobby of the opera house? l'll take that as a yes by the look on your face. l was there too. And so was Hera. That shouldn't be possible. Add it to the list. Were you trying to reach Hera? l don't know. l just knew that l had to protect her with my life. l'm telling you, Bill, they put the music in the ship. l can hear it. - l believe you. l'll look into it. - You'll look into it? You'll look into it? l am here telling you there is Cylon sabotage aboard our ship! Sabotage? With music? l know, l know. l can't quite understand it myself, but... There's too much confusion. l promise l'll look into it. Now l have to get to court. OK. OK. Go to court. (door opens) There must be some kind of way out of here. Do you recognise this document, Lieutenant? Yes, l do. It's a death list issued on New Caprica by the office of the president. - Who signed this document? - President Gaius Baltar. Hm. - Could it be a forgery? - No. And how do you know that it cannot be a forgery? - Because l was there. l saw him sign it. - What are you saying?! You weren't there! - That's a lie! That's a total fabrication! - <i>(Franks)</i> Order! l saw him sign it. Describe the scene, would you? The Cylons brought the document into the presidential office. They'd already selected the names. One of them, l believe it was a Three, gave the list to the president and said: "Here are the people that are going to be executed. Please sign this." He looked at the list, he saw all the names... and then he signed it. Did he protest? l mean, did he argue? Did he offer any resistance whatsoever? - <i>(man)</i> Sign it! - <i>(Baltar)</i> l won't do it. You're going to have to solve your consciences some other way. Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it! No. He never did. Oh, Felix. Oh, Felix. What are you doing? Get that out of my face. - We'll get him in the cross. - Control your client. It's no secret. The whole fleet knows this man tried to stab me through the neck. And you missed! Butter fingers! - Sorry, Your Honours. - No further questions. Your witness, Counsellor. - No questions. - <i>(Baltar)</i> What?! (muttering/gavel bangs) - What are you? - Witness is dismissed. (Baltar) Oh! Oh, great. - What the hell are you doing? - It's your word against his. If he's decided to perjure himself, there's nothing we can do. We're going to have to adjust our strategy. Is the defence prepared to present their case? Your Honours, at this time, if it please the court... uh... l would like to offer a motion. The defence would like to move for a mistrial. No, we do not want a mistrial! l do not want a mistrial! (Franks) Gaius Baltar! Behave, Dr Baltar. On what grounds, Counsellor? On the grounds that one of the panel has already prejudged the outcome of this trial and determined the guilt of the defendant. That's a very serious charge, Mr Lampkin. Which judge? - That would be you, Admiral. - <i>(muttering)</i> And to prove it, l need to take the unusual step of calling Mr Lee Adama to the stand. (muttering) - You've gotta be frakking kidding me! - This is the only way we're gonna win. - l will not testify against my father. - That is your choice. Either way, l'm putting you on the stand. Your Honours, this is completely improper. Counsel cannot testify at trial. l can cite at least seven precedents off the top of my head. - Call your witness, Counsellor. - Thank you. Mr Adama. Mr Adama, did you meet with your father, Admiral Adama, four days ago? Yes. At that meeting, did Admiral Adama express an opinion as to whether the defendant deserved a trial? All l'm looking for is the truth here, Mr Adama. Let's have it. l'm waiting. Answer the question. You swore an oath as an officer of the court. If you don't answer the question, you hold the entire system of justice... - What frakking system?! - Mr Adama. l'm sorry, Your Honours. Please excuse my associate. All right, all right. l'll try something else. Do you believe that the defendant deserves a fair trial? - As a matter of fact, l do. - Why? Aside from the fact everyone deserves a fair trial, l also happen to believe that he is not guilty... Your Honours, l must insist on an exception here. - He can't testify in this way. It is improper. - l agree. He can make his argument in closing statements. l'm inclined to agree with the prosecution. Thank you. You can appeal to the president if you feel that this influences the verdict, but I, for one, would like to hear this witness testify. (male judge) l would second that. - Continue. - Thank you, Your Honours. Mr Adama? - Mr Adama? - Yes? Why do you believe that the defendant, Gaius Baltar, deserves to be acquitted? Well, because the evidence does not support the charges. Come on. Did the defendant make mistakes? Sure, he did. Serious mistakes. But did he actually commit any crimes? Did he commit treason? No. It was an impossible situation. When the Cylons arrived, what could he do? What could anyone have done? Ask yourself, what would you have done? What would you have done? If he had refused to surrender, the Cylons would've nuked the planet then and there. So did he appear to cooperate with the Cylons? Sure. So did hundreds of others. What's the difference between him and them? The president issued a blanket pardon. They were all forgiven, no questions asked. Colonel Tigh... Colonel Tigh used suicide bombers, killed dozens of people. Forgiven. Lieutenant Agathon and Chief Tyrol, they murdered an officer on the <i>Pegasus.</i> Forgiven. The admiral. The admiral instituted a military coup d'état against the president. Forgiven. And me? Well... where do l begin? l shot down a civilian passenger ship - the <i>Olympic Carrier.</i> Over a thousand people on board. Forgiven. l raised my weapon to a superior officer, committed an act of mutiny. Forgiven. Then, on the very day Baltar surrendered to those Cylons, I, as commander of <i>Pegasus,</i> jumped away. l left everybody on that planet alone, undefended, for months! l even tried to persuade the admiral never to return, to abandon you all there for good. If l'd had my way, nobody would've made it off that planet. l'm the coward. l'm the traitor. l'm forgiven. l'd say we're very forgiving of mistakes. We make our own laws now, our own justice, and we've been pretty creative at finding ways to let people off the hook for everything - theft, murder. And we've had to be. Because... because we are not a civilisation any more. We are a gang. And we're on the run. And we have to fight to survive. We have to break rules, we have to bend laws, we have to improvise. But not this time, no. Not this time. Not for Gaius Baltar. No. You... you have to die. You have to die because... Well, because we don't like you very much. Because you're arrogant. Because you're weak. Because you're a coward. We wanna throw you out the airlock because you didn't stand up to the Cylons and get yourself killed in the process. That's justice now! You should've been killed on New Caprica. But since you had the temerity to live, we'll execute you now. That's justice! (muttering) (gavel bangs) Order. Order! This case... this case is built on emotion, on anger, bitterness, vengeance. But most of all it is built on shame. It's about the shame of what we did to ourselves back on that planet. And it's about the guilt of those of us who ran away. Who ran away. And we are trying to dump all that guilt and all that shame onto one man. And then flush him out the airlock and hope that that just gets rid of it all, so that we can live with ourselves. That won't work. That won't work. That's not justice. Not to me. Not to me. No further questions. Your Honours, l wish to reiterate my strong exception to counsel's testimony. - <i>(Franks)</i> Exception noted. - Thank you. Did you want to cross-examine the witness? l have no questions for defence counsel. (Franks) Witness is excused. Do you want to call any other witnesses? Your Honours, l don't wish to belabour this any longer. The defence rests. Very well. This court will adjourn to consider a verdict. What a glorious moment in jurisprudence. You did a great job. (man) All rise. Before l read the verdict, l'd like to make one thing clear. Like everything human, justice is imperfect. It's flawed. But it's those very imperfections that separates us from the machines, and maybe even makes us a species worth saving. The defendant will rise. Gaius Baltar, after carefully weighing the evidence, this tribunal, on a vote of three to two... finds you not guilty. (uproar) You won. Let's go. l knew l would be acquitted, but the fact that l was found innocent shouldn't disguise in any way that this trial has been a total pantomime. Admiral, you've gotta get him out of here. Down! Bring him down! Stand back! Get him out of here! Get him away! l knew right from the very start that if there was a way to demonstrate the sheer... What's the word l'm looking for? Hypocrisy. "Hypocrisy" is the word l'm looking for. ...hypocrisy of the prosecution's case, then the judges had no other option but to find me not guilty. Your boundless confidence provided us with great solace throughout. Look, l wanna thank you both. Truly. From the bottom of my heart, l am very, very grateful for all you've done. If l could've seen the admiral squirm a little bit more, it wouldn't have hurt. Now, you listen. Don't push it, Doctor. Fine. Romo, um... perhaps we could have a chat. l've thought about a book tour around the fleet, and there's the publishing rights. There are issues about my security - where l'm gonna live. Since we forged this great relationship during the trial, l thought who better to... Actually, now that the fleet's legal system is in place, my not-so-inconsiderable talents are required elsewhere. So l'm afraid this is the end of our journey. What? Wait a minute, what? What about me? Wait a minute. Wait, please. Think about this for a second. Where am l going to live? What am l going to do? How am l going to survive? Much as l hate to use a cat metaphor, Doctor... l think you'll land on your feet. (chuckles) Close the door on your way out. Romo, one thing. When you put me on the stand, did you know what was gonna happen? l knew you were an honest man, Mr Adama, much unlike your grandfather. Gaius Baltar is innocent. Just the sound of it makes my skin crawl. Not guilty is not the same as innocent. It must have been particularly difficult for you. What? You just couldn't get the other two guys to budge? You voted for his acquittal, didn't you? l hate to say it. Defence made their case. Prosecution didn't. Gaius Baltar is a traitor. We both know that, regardless of the outcome of this trial. No one's asking anyone to forget, or to forgive. But we have to look to the future. - Mr Gaeta. - Yes, sir? Commence jump prep. - We're going to the Ionian Nebula. - Yes, sir. Excuse me. (Gaeta) Coordinates distributed. All ships show green for jump formation delta. - Initiate jump. - Aye, sir. Jumping in three, two, one. Jump. Jump complete. - All fleet ships reporting in, sir. - Very well, Mr Gaeta. Commence DRADIS scan. Let's see what's out there. Oh! Ooh. (Gaeta) Sensors show major power fluctuations. Checking on fleet.

Batteries only. (Adama) Get ready for an engine restart. (man) DC6 needs to get down there and muster. Gaius. It's OK. Come with me. - Where are you taking me to? - To your new life. Here. Come. Let's get the power back up. Come on, people. You know what to do. (static) (voices slow down and fade) There must be some kind of way out here. (Racetrack) There's lots of equipment around. It's all live. Said the joker to the thief. (static) (breathes heavily) There's too much confusion here. (retches) l can't get no relief. (Tory) Hey. This isn't happening. Please tell me this isn't happening. So that's it. After all this time, a switch goes off just... like that. Whoa. Oh, no way. l don't believe this. l'm not buying this. This is a... This is a trick. Come on! We're not... We're not... What is that... song? I... (hums "All Along The Watchtower") (joins in humming) (hums) (all hum "All Along The Watchtower") All right! That's enough, godsdammit! Deadbolt that frakking door! 40 years in the service. 40 years. Two wars. Combat. Locked in that dungeon on New Caprica. Ellen. My gods! What about Ellen? No, no, no, no, no. Not after all this. Not after the Resistance... and the occupation. After watching my friends die one after another for frakking this?! - Sam. - Stay the hell away from me. You all just stay the frak away from me. (Chief) Sam... it's true. We're Cylons. And we have been from the start. - <i>(Roslin)</i> Admiral, what's going on? - Some kind of power surge. Give me a damage report immediately. The power outage was fleet-wide, Admiral. It was also simultaneously restored to all ships. - Admiral, admiral. - DRADIS contact. Massive Cylon fleet on intercept course. Gaeta, sound action stations immediately. XO, l want emergency jump, entire fleet. Sir, all fleet ships were powered down during the outage. It'll take 20 minutes to spool up FTL drives. We just don't have 20 minutes. Action stations. Set condition one throughout the ship. All Viper pilots report to Vipers immediately. Inbound Cylon fleet. l repeat. Action stations. Set condition one throughout the ship. This is not a drill. Oh, gods. What are we gonna do? The ship is under attack. We do our jobs. Report to your stations. But where's the stations? My name is Saul Tigh. l am an officer in the Colonial fleet. Whatever else l am, whatever else it means, that's the man l want to be. And if l die today, that's the man l'll be. - Where the hell have you been?! - l'll tell you later. Get those steps off. Get those steps off. Come on! All right, people. We are under attack! Let's go, let's go! - <i>(Adama)</i> Arm and load nuclear weapons. - <i>(Helo)</i> Yes, sir. - It's good to see you, Colonel. - Good to be here, Admiral. - You can count on me. - l've never doubted it. l'm here if you need me, Madam President. # There must be some way out of here # Said the joker to the thief # There's too much confusion Alert Vipers are away.
