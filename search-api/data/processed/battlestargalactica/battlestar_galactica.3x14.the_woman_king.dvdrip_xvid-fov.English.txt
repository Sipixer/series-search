Yes, that's right. Then how come some Cylon lover is holding down my post? Hera's alive. l'm her mother and l'm going to get her. l'm begging you to do this. (yells) You've put the entire fleet in jeopardy. Are you aware of that? l'm not a traitor. l did what l thought was right. She'll get Hera. Let's go. - No! Hold your fire! - Get out of the way! Throw that thing in the brig. l demand my rights as a Colonial citizen to legal representation and full due process. Do you? - So what happens next? - We give him his trial. They think they can squeeze these into the starboard hangar? That's why Helo's down here. To manage the civilian refugees. l've got the breakdown on the Thera Sita's inhabitants coming aboard. 51 Sagittarons. - Oh, boy. - Helo may be overmatched down there. Pretty rough night last night, huh? Hey. l said you didn't sleep so well. Oh, stupid dream. Whatever. - So, you're OK? - Yeah. They're about to increase the population down there by 300. l don't know where l'll put 'em, but l'm not walking around taking my own pulse. - l'm fine. - <i>(Apollo)</i> There he is. - If it isn't the mayor of Dogsville. - Cut him some slack. Hear you got another shipload of loyal subjects. Helo, come here. l need a favour. l have a date tonight with this ripped- and-ready nugget that l want to break in. Think you can wrangle me up one of those sexy cubicles? - Yeah, yeah. - <i>(Apollo)</i> See you around, Helo. Yeah. You guys know where to find me. - You're gonna check up on Hera, right? - Yes. Babe, l'm gonna check up on Hera. - Love you. - Love you too. l need you to keep moving. You need to keep moving. l know, l know. We'll deal with your concerns. Keep moving. Welcome aboard <i>Galactica.</i> My name is Captain Karl Agathon. l've been assigned to look after your personal welfare. - Where are you putting the Sagittarons? - Arrangements haven't been made yet. - We want to be with our own! - You heard. Get your ass in motion! Move! l got things under control here, Colonel. Yeah. Sure you do. Excuse me. Could l have a brief look at your son? No, no, no. We're fine. We don't need a doctor. l know. We don't need a doctor. We're Sagittaron. We don't believe in medicine. It's all right. This is Dr Robert. He's our civilian doctor. He has nothing to do with the military. We'll respect your traditions. You can trust me. l'm Sagittaron. It's OK. It's OK. OK? Can l feel that? Would you open your mouth for me? Open wide. All right. Look at this. - Do you feel anything? How about here? - <i>(groans)</i> - <i>(mother)</i> That's enough. - Get your hands off me! That's enough. That's enough. Thank you. - Sir. - Hey, keep your hands to yourself. - OK. - All right? (coughing) Mike. You braindead card cheat. You still owe me that drink. - Saul, get out of here. Now. - Well, you're in a good mood today. Hey, Doc. Some of these people, they look, um... - Sick. - Sick, yeah. (Dualla) Medic! - Dr Robert! - Leave, Saul. - Get your hands off my son! No! - <i>(Robert)</i> Got him. Got him. - Where are they taking him? - It's all right, ma'am. Just walk this way. (coughing) - So, what have we got here, Mike? - Mellorak sickness. It originates in the kidneys then attacks the respiratory and the immune system. It's a nasty bit of business. If you don't treat the first symptoms in 48 hours, it will kill you in three to five days. - How contagious is it? - It's not airborne, so we lucked out there. It's spread through human contact. Saliva, sexual intercourse, through the skin... Right now, it seems confined to the Sagittarons. That's good. They're welcome to it. It's spreading down there, where we were working. - It's curable? - <i>(Cottle)</i> Absolutely. A shot of bittamusin and you're right as rain in a day or two. And sedatives alleviate the symptoms. l don't know how long our stock will hold out, so we should conserve it and only inoculate after the first symptoms show. (Adama) This is a civilian infection, so it's in your hands. But l want Tyrol and the crew immunised before they get sick. If we disinfect everything and stress hygiene, some people won't get sick. And they won't need the medicine. Shouldn't we get everyone in the showers? Especially the Sagittarons. - We should make an announcement. - No, we don't want to... single them out more than we have to - we'll have a riot on our hands. If it were up to me, l would say just get the Sagittarons settled, and then deal with the civvies that have already arrived. You won't have to worry about having enough medicine for the Sagittarons. Yeah. Most of them are gonna refuse it. People are gonna die. For the last 3,000 years, medicine's been the great curse. They're a bunch of stubborn root-sucking jackasses holding on to traditions that are a thousand years old. (chanting) Drink this. Stink enough for you in here? - Yeah, it's a really potent smell. - Yeah. That's burdock root. The Sagittarons use it as a calmative. - Does it work? - Hell, l don't know. They're all gonna die anyway. (Zarek) Tell me there won't be a trial. Gaius Baltar will be tried for high crimes and treason. A tribunal of judges will hear the evidence against him. A verdict will be read. He will be found guilty and he will be finally held responsible for his actions. If you can summon up a little patience, as l have done, we will get through this ordeal. Listen to me. Baltar will get his trial. And this is what you'll get - a hurricane. The media will descend on you and watch and question your every move. You will have sectarian violence, assassination attempts. You will have civil unrest on a scale we've never seen. Work, labour, everyday routine in this fleet will come to a complete halt. This trial is going to bring this entire fleet down. Mr Vice President, we have a security plan in order, which includes rapid marine deployment, increased CAP operations, security... A hurricane, Laura. If l were you, l'd declare martial law during the trial. You're going to need a lot more than a little patience to survive. l'm here if you need me. Your best friend's your worst enemy. l've never seen him like that. He was truly frightened. We are not sick. Sags brought the sickness with them. Send them back! - Where do you suggest l send them? - l don't know. Figure it out. OK. Your concerns have been noted. We're gonna do the best we can. Yes. Can l help you? My son is dead. l'm sorry. It's a soma braid, right? You Sagittarons believe it's supposed to bring good health? Look, l'm sorry. It's not enough. If you don't treat the disease, it's fatal, OK? - This didn't have to happen. - Yes, it did. He was killed. No. Ma'am, he died. OK? He died because he needed real medicine. He died because l made a mistake. OK. OK. Good. Yeah. Then, please, tell the others. l will. l will tell them not to trust him. They warned me about him, but l wouldn't listen. l didn't want my son to die. l took a chance. l went to Dr Robert. l let the doctor give the medicine to Willie. Ma'am... you waited too long. Willie had been sick for less than 12 hours. He was 19. He is dead. That doctor killed my son. (sobs) - We lost another one last night. - Yeah. Willie King. No. A three-year-old girl whose parents refused to let me treat her. Willie King's mother lost Willie King. It's a shame. The boy was a goner. You saw him when he came in here. He was at least three days symptomatic. You explained this to the mother? Yes, of course l did. What the hell am l supposed to say to her? "If you would have just turned the corner sooner on this superstitious crap, we could have saved your son"? Get your shirt off, would you? - Excuse me? - l'm gonna vaccinate you. l'm not sick. We're rationing. Think l'm gonna wait until you're on your back for a day? Who else is gonna help me here? OK. OK. Oh, l talked to, uh, Tigh. He was asking about you. l told him you were doing a hell of a job. l wouldn't wish this place on anybody. - Come on. You ready? - Yeah. This might sting a bit. You're done. No! Yeah! All right, Hands of Stone. Let me see what you've got. Put it in the hole, Marge. Want to know my secret, Connor? l pretend this thing is your face. Hey. It's Mellorak Man. Everybody run. Relax. The doc dosed me. l hear it's pretty rough down there, huh? Only if you're a Sagittaron. Dying, you know? It just... it seems so senseless. Yeah, well, you'll get no tears from me. Bad enough my gang's gotta sweat through their stench. One of these days, l'm gonna be really pissed cos we're out of meds cos those Sags saw the light and we had to share. You gonna babble or shoot? Yeah! None of those religious freaks lifted a finger down on New Caprica. - Chief, knock it off. - A lot of good people lost their lives. l said knock it off, all right? Oh. - Sorry, Dee. - It's all right. l have more of a reason to be mad at them than you do. l am Sagittaron. Most of them are paranoid, pig-headed and argumentative. They're sure making it miserable for Dr Robert. Medicine's an abomination. It's a sin against the gods. Physicians spread disease cos they refuse to acknowledge that the body and the mind are myths. This body is no myth. - If l get sick, l'm gonna see Dr Robert. - <i>(Apollo)</i> You're not getting sick. Anyone but Cottle. Near-sighted bastard. He might as well use a spike instead of a needle. So they're treating you well, then? Yeah. Well enough. They take a while to get to the point, though, don't they? Look, Six... l wanna thank you for what you did. l'm still not sure why you did it, though. Exactly. What are we doing here? How could you possibly throw yourself on the mercy of these people? - <i>(Sharon)</i> And now you're here. - Yeah. Your best chance of survival is to work with them. And that means to help them expose Baltar for his crimes. Look, l gotta go. So, um... l'm gonna look into some clothes for you. Please, take care of yourself. Hey. Thank you for the visit. To have some company... Thank you. (Sharon) No. l care about you. (Baltar) Do you think any of them care about you? l imagine they don't. So, what are you doing here again? - l'm still trying to figure that out. - So you're here to save them, are you? l told you, l don't know. You're here... because you want to be human. But there's a trick to being human. You have to think only about yourself. - <i>(Roslin)</i> What do you think she's doing? - l don't know. She's talking to something or someone. l don't know. l've seen her do it before. (shouting) (man) We can't let him do it! He's a murderer! - <i>(guard)</i> Stay back! - <i>(man #2)</i> Get him! (guard) Stay back! Everybody back! Step away from him! Everybody back! Get off him! Now! Move back, people! Move back! Back away, now! - He killed my father! - l tried to help him, you ignorant fool! - Get off me! - OK. Get behind me. So you immunised the old man, but he still died. What made him and his father change their mind about getting immunised? Who said they changed their mind? l administered the bittamusin on my own. Without their consent? It was the middle of the night. The old man was screaming in pain. l mean, what was l supposed to do? OK, I... l don't understand. Aren't we rationing? It was well after the 48 hours. Yeah, that's right. But it's not exact. Everybody's different. OK, he was marginal. Look. l'm not gonna sit here and apologise to you for doing my job. l've got two Picons that are starting to show symptoms. Now, l'm gonna go treat them, if it's all right with you. The doctor's version of when he gave the drug greatly differed from Mrs King's. Who? The woman. King. The one l told you about - Mrs King. Her son showed symptoms. She took him for treatment. The boy still died. And Robert treated a Sagittaron without the man's consent. We should have done that in the first place. The disease would have been gone. The only reason we didn't is we're respecting the customs of the Sagittarons. But he didn't respect them. Sir, people could be dying under Robert's care. People die under my care every day. It goes with the damn job. - Killing doesn't. - Killing? You are way out of line. Mike Robert deserves better than this. Even if he isn't treating some of these people unethically, l'm concerned he's created a situation down there. It's bad. Captain... l have the former president of the Colonies sitting in a prison cell, a Cylon woman is in custody, and a population that would jump at the chance to tear both of them apart. My ship is overcrowded, and l have an epidemic on my hands. Now, the question is, are you capable of doing your job? And are you gonna stop making these unfounded accusations? Are you? - Yes, sir. - Dismissed. (grunts) (Tigh) Agathon! Why don't you knock it off, Helo? Get your teeth out of the doc's ass. - It's not doing you any good. - With all due respect... sir, l think Robert might be hurting people. He is the only one to say anything good about you in as long as l can remember. You may as well take whatever credibility you have left and chuck it out an airlock. You want to stand up for these crazy frakking people? What is it with you? You just like being on the outside looking in, don't you? l don't know what you mean by that, sir. Unless you're referring to my wife. Again. Mike Robert is a stand-up guy. A Caprican. One of our own. A man l can trust. On New Caprica, he worked with the Resistance. He patched up my eye. He fought the enemy. While you were snuggled up in bed with your Cylon wife every night. Colonel! You OK? (Tigh groans) So. You do give a frak what your friends think. Good for you. That's how it should be. But you know what? l give a frak, too. About friends, about loyalty. You keep soiling Mike Robert's good name, and we are gonna finish this. How does that sound to you? You'd better have the doctor look at that hand. (Helo) Sorry, you're gonna have to wait. Excuse me. 15 minutes, people. l'll be back in 15 minutes. l'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sir, get your hands off me. - Sharon. - Helo. - What's going on? - How's Hera? What do you mean? She got sick about an hour ago. They pulled me off CAP. - What? No one told me. - They sent her to Dr Robert. I... l don't know if she needs this. This is serious. She could die from this. Here we go. Here we go. It's all right. Look at this. Here. Here's your toy. Good girl. Good girl. Now, these are sedatives in pill form. Give her a half every six hours. Just crush it up. - OK. She'll be OK, though? - She'll be fine. You can take her home. - Thank you, Doctor. - OK. Bye-bye. - All right. Bye-bye. - <i>(Sharon)</i> Say bye-bye. Bye-bye. She'll be fine. All right? OK. Oh. Uh, listen. Would you give this to Mrs King? This is... uh... It belonged to her son. l know she would want it back. All right? Hi. Dr Robert gave me this to give to you. He gave you this? Huh. How is your daughter? - She's fine, thanks. - Good. Mrs King? Please. l need to ask you something. If you thought Dr Robert was dangerous, why let him treat your son? You said you were warned. l couldn't believe anyone could have that much hate in them. - But you understand how... - l'm through talking. Talking isn't gonna bring Willie back. l think you should leave now. Mrs King, I... l'm sorry. You seem angry. l'm not. l'm just... Work. It's OK that you hate your job. It's OK... it's OK to admit it, too. It's not the job. l know the job sucks. l don't need to be reminded of it. OK. - Then what is it? - Look. It's what l see every day. OK? It's hard to not see it. See what? - Talk to me, Karl. - l don't know, l keep doing it. l keep doing it. l keep ending up on the wrong side of everything. You know, maybe Tigh's right. Maybe l want it that way. What if l'm flying a desk not because l'm good at it, but because it's the right punishment for the guy who crosses the line? Maybe l belong in Dogsville. So you're saying... - Just leave it. - What does that mean, "Just leave it"? It means it's your job to manage these people, Helo, and you've just gotta do it. Yeah. You... you know what? You're right. It's me. It's all in my frakking head. l didn't say that. - Where are you going? - l don't know. (sighs) Doc? You ought to try a bed, Helo. You'll get more sleep that way. He's killing them. It's right here. Get your ass outta here right now, before l have the old man lock you up. No, listen to me. He killed them. On New Caprica. Look. Guy goes in for a cough, dies of heart failure. Here. See for yourself. This one. Woman had appendicitis, died on the operating table. Of the Picons he treated, 12% of them died. Capricans. Oh, he likes Capricans. The mortality rate was 6°/ª. Sagittarons? 90°/ª. - 90% of the Sagittarons died... - l'm not going to listen to this. - That man has his hands full down there. - He's singling out Sagittarons. - That doesn't bother you? - What? - That doesn't bother you? - What is he doing? - l don't know. l'm not a doctor. - The first sensible thing you've said. Listen. l don't think he's giving them the medicine. He's doing something. You're not gonna let it go, are you? Please. Can you do an autopsy on Mrs King's son to see how he died? l'll let it go. l will. l promise. l will let it go. Just check. l did. l checked King's son. Mellorak sickness. He had bittamusin in his system. All right? Now, that's it. Now, you just leave it. And get outta here! Hey, Doc? l don't really feel so good. Think l could get some of that bittamusin? (banging on door) (Sharon whispers) Who is it? Hey, Hera. It's OK. - Mrs King? - Your friend, the soldier... Dualla? She's sick. She went to the doctor. She went... - Slow down. What? - You listen to me. We lost two more tonight. Sagittarons who let that murderer treat them. - You have to do something. - Excuse me. What is she doing here? - There she is! - You're not supposed to be here. Let's go. Now. Sorry, Captain. Frakking refugees. l don't know how she snuck through. Morning, sir. Don't. Don't even think it. Sharon, it's Dualla. Dualla went down there. - She has a husband. - Yeah, and he's out flying CAP. She'll be fine. She'll take her meds. She'll be fine. You know what's all over the ship? You and the Sagittarons. How you might actually be listening to them. That's my job. They die because they refuse medication. You want me to look the other way, is that it? - Hera's OK. That's all that matters? - No! Or is it because as long as everyone hates Sagittarons, they forget you're a Cylon? You shut the frak up. Yeah, look the other way. l have to fight every day on this ship to be accepted. This is nothing to do with you. OK? You think that's who l am? That's my defining characteristic? The guy married to a Cylon? This guy's dirty. l think he's killing people because he's a racist son of a bitch. Make a hole! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Dee. Dee. Dualla? Dualla? No. No, no, no, no, no, no! Dualla. Hey! Oh, hey. What are you doing down here? Dr Robert. He gave me something. It kicked the frak out of me. - Where's Lee? - We're gonna go see him. Come on. l'm gonna take you to Cottle. - No. - Yeah. - l'm Hands of Stone. - l know. l know. Come on. - What are you doing? - She's coming with me. - She's in no condition to go anywhere. - l'm taking her to Cottle just to be sure. What do you mean? Get the hell outta here! Get the frak out of my way, Doctor! Now! - Come on, Dee. Come on. - No. Security! Agathon. He's lost it. He's hurting one of my patients. - l'm taking her to Cottle. - Get the XO. Leave me alone. No. Not Cottle. Please just leave me alone! - Captain. What's going on, sir? - Leave me alone. - Captain! - l wanna sleep. - No, no, Dee. - <i>(guard)</i> She doesn't want to go. - Sir! She says she doesn't want to go! - Get your hand off me, Sergeant! Get your gun outta my face! - Get your gun outta my face, Sergeant! - Cool it! l don't know who you're trying to impress, but it seriously is not working. You're killing them. l know you're doing it. - Stand down! - Saul. - You didn't tell me he was dangerous! - Shut the frak up! How is she? She's been sedated. But she's OK. You don't believe him, do you? He's seriously delusional. He needs help. Yeah. And we should have given it to him. Doc? l didn't check Willie's blood until a couple of hours ago. l was exhausted, and l'll admit the Sagittarons annoy the hell out of me. l didn't want to go against my colleague. But you were right. There was no bittamusin in the King boy's body. - He died because it was too late. - No, he didn't. He died of acute cell destruction. He was injected with a toxic bisphosphonate. You got a wrong reading. l don't know what else... No! The old man, Mr Buckminster, died of the same thing. - There was no bittamusin in his system. - You killed them, you sick frak. You ought to be on your knees thanking me for saving your daughter's life. For having the meds to cure her of her illness. You know how painful this disease is at the end. And they don't want our help. Now, why waste time and meds and space on them when all of those resources could go to those who really deserve it? Who gets the medication when there's not enough? A Sagittaron who won't even raise a finger to defend his own race, or a Viper pilot? What the hell happened to "Do no harm", Doctor? l intervened because someone has to make the tough choices. But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Look at them. They're gonna destroy themselves anyway. l mean, look at them. They're like worms crawling on a hot rock. Remember what you used to say, Saul? Aside from a Cylon, is there anything that you hate more than a Sagittaron? l'll tell you what l hate, Mike. Being wrong. - Captain Agathon. - Sir. Arrest this son of a bitch. Gag him if you have to. My pleasure, sir. l didn't harm her. Right. She's one of the good ones. Sir. You wanted to see me? Yes, Captain. Please, sit down. There's hate, and there's allowing hate. Two sides of the same coin, really. We're guilty of both. Somewhere, we got lost. You being the Ione voice in the wilderness, we were bound to stay that way for a while. This is my ship. And l owe you an apology. - That's not necessary, sir. - All the same... you still have it. That'll be all, Captain.
