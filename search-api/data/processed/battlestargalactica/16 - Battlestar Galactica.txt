we're-we're kinda lost again. We're trying to get to the CIC. Could you- alking, no talking, please. No cheating. Hold it up a little higher. Eight. Sneaky. Nine. Uh... start again. You lost track. Zero. I've asked you here to find out why the Cylons hate us so much. It's what you said at the ceremony. That humanity was a flawed creation.</i> And that people still kill one another for petty jealousy and greed.</i> HmYosaid that humanity never asked itself why it deserved to survive. Maybe you don't. Sleeper... agents... within the Fleet. Takeover by brute force... Cylon impregnation... and reproduction... Multiple models... suicide bombings... assault on natural resources. Eyewitnesses claim to have seen one of the known Cylon models</i> moving in and out of Galactica's brig.</i> Admiral Adama has made no comment</i> on this situation. We will continue to- How the hell did this get out to the press? I'm surpri it didn't happen sooner.</i> m told you've been meeting with her regularly, allowing her to interact with members of your crew. She's a military asset, providing us with vital strategic intelligence. While we pray that she's not somehow... colluding with other Cylons. If I felt for one second that she posed some kind of a threat to this fleet,</i> I'd pull the trigger on her myself. I think the fleet may need to hear that, Admiral. Even more, they need ve it. Someone took theto vitamins this morning. Yeah, I don't know what got into me. No, you're right. Keeping Sharon Valerii alive, allowing her pregnancy to continue- There is no road map for any of this. Somebody, somebody has got to keep asking the hard questions. I agree. I wanna stay ahead of this. Acknowledge the Cylons' existence, and then make... some kind of case for her to stay aboard Galactica. I don't think that's gonna work. What? Why? I think you need to trust the people. Use the press, tell them the truth. I mean, we barely know anything about the Cylons. And until we learn more, we're not gonna destroy the only source of information that we have, period. Period. That simple, huh? Uh... well... Um, could I- could I have a minute? Sure. Important? Mm-hmm. You were saying about the hard questions... I know it's just my debate team ring, but it's the best I could do. This... this really isn't how I planned it. Anyway, um... Billy... I love you. I've loved you since- since the first day I met you. I mean, you were half naked, granted... I know that I kind of blindsided you with this. Okay? I mean, it doesn't have to be tomorrow. We can take our time. Billy, I can't marry you. I don't know how else to say it. I'm sorry. He pulled out that ring... and it was like an electric shock. I could barely say anything. Well, maybe you're regretting that you didn't say yes. No. I don't know what to make of me and Billy, but... I know I can't marry him. Then again, I don't know what to make of you and me either. 'Scuse me. Hey, two more. Coming right up. Ellen. It's, uh... it's... good to see you.</i> It's good to see you, Captain. Dee. Billy. I didn't know you were coming down here. I, um... I grabbed a two-day rotation. I thought I'd grab some R & R. I'm on business, as usual. Captain Adama. Oh... I really am an idiot, aren't I? No, Billy- Don't. Don't bother. Can you give us a minute? No, you know what? Have a seat, Captain.</i> Be my guest. Billy, I'm sorry. I thought if anything, we were honest with each other. But you knew you were gonna be here with him today, and you let me propose to you. I didn't- I know that giving you that ring was stupid. That's fine. And maybe this wasn't gonna work out between us. But this... You should've told me about this. Well, it's hard, you know? To choose the people we fall in love with. To love only one person at a time. People like us... are more complicated. Us? I'm sorry. I'm here with friends. Ellen, you're a regular here, right? You ever see that woman before?</i> In the corner? Oh... only when I came in and wondered when they were gonna start enforcing a dress code. Ellen, the bathroom's over here. Are you serious? Let's go. Lee Adama, you amaze me. Shh. This is it now. You ready? Yes. We're with you. Do it. Everybody by the bar! Now! Move! You, you-t up against the bar Oh, my gods. Three men, one wan, all armed. Is it true the Fleet knows I'm on Galactica? I'm interested in navigational weaknesses. Worm holes, dark matter blind spots.</i> Likely ambushes. I would avoid these pulsar pointers because of dradis interference. If I was gonna plan an ambush, I'd do it there.</i> It depends, Admiral. They adapt to your every move. Every move triggers a counter-move. Adapt. That's what you're good at, right? Why won't you answer my question? Does the Fleet know I'm on Galactica? Mm. It's the baby. She's kicking. The Fleet knows. That'll be all for today. Guards. You know, if people knew how much you've relied on that thing's so-called intelligence, they'd be scared out of their wits. What about you, Saul? Are you afraid of her? You know, the truth is... I don't like the way it gotten under your skin. What are you doing? What are you doing? The pressure hatch can withstand explosive decompression. The only way help's getting in is with a raft of high explosives.</i> Or we could just let these clowns open the pressure door for us. There's bound to be a security force on its way soon. Open the door for us? Why would they do that? Gimme your drink. Let me talk to them. The ice- I need the dry ice. Okay, stay calm. Ellen! Please don't shoot. Who are you? Ellen Tigh. Get over here. Now. Move. We are not criminals. We are members of the Fleet, just like you. My husband's XO of Galactica. You've just made the worst mistakes of your life.</i> Colonel Tigh, Admiral- you need to hear this. Saul- Ellen? What's wrong? They're holding us hostage. They're threatening to kill us! My name is Sesha Abinell. I have seized control of the Cloud Nine lounge...</i> and held the people in it hostage.</i> What do you want? What I want... This is not about... what I want.</i> The Colonial Fleet has become a Cylon-occupied territory.</i> You are working in collusion with a Cylon agent-</i> The very same model of a Cylon</i> who tried to murder you, Admiral Adama,</i> on your own ship. We want Sharon Valerii. You have two hours. Get me everything you can on Sesha Abinell. Yes, sir. Sesha Abinell... Fleet records indicate she's the widow</i> of a Ray Abinell. He was a casualty aboard the Greenleaf freighter when the Cylons hit it about ten weeks ago. Widow. Who do we have aboard Cloud Nine? Uh, rotation schedule shows... Captain Adama, half a Marine squad, and Starbuck's already there on R & R.</i> Get me Starbuck right away. Yes, sir. Hell, one of you beauties has got to be an O-2 sensor. And I'm guessing it's you. Take a sip of carbon dioxide. There was another guy at the bar. Check the back. We don't want any more mistakes. Kern, ere's anawful lot of military types here. And that's why we're here. To get Galactica's attention, remember? Page. You go. No problem. Good to see ya, Gunny. I'm gonna need some of those gorillas you call Marines. Most of my gorillas are already here, sir. Just trying to cop a little R & R.</i> Tell me about it. All right, here's what we know. We got an unknown number of shooters at least 20 hostages. And about a 90-minute window before they start throwing out bodies. You got a plan, sir? Lock and load. Let's figure out the rest as we go along. Put your weapon down. Tell them. He says he's Captain Adama from the Galactica. He just wants to talk. Talk, that's it. Just talk. They're together. Put it down. Or she dies. Hey, she dies, he dies, you get it? Difference is, you won't do it. He will. Okay? We all have someone we care about. It's his son. He's not gonna choose the Cylon over his son. Get in line with the others. CO-2 is through the roof. They're trying to suffocate us. What is this, a trap? There's a reason you don't just start shooting</i> on a spaceship. You probably nicked a line. Why don't you let me talk to the Admiral,</i> see if we can't find a way out of this? I've got two strike teams inbound to you. ETA ten minutes. We'll have plenty of fire power, so that's good. But I'm concerned with limited accesedints. Admiral. It's Abinell. Keep Starbuck on the line with us.</i> Adama. We're losing oxygen. If it's not restored, the hostages die. Then you'll all die. Because this is over. Not until the Cylon's dead. I'm willing to die to see this through. You willing to risk your son's life? Son of a bitch. Suddenly you're listening. Gods damn it, give her what she wants! Give her the Cylon! You're all alone on this, Admiral. I'm not gonna sacrifice a military asset</i> on your altar of revenge. What are you talking about? This isn't a- You said this was about us being played by the Cylons.</i> But it isn't. It's about the loss of your husband, and I understand that.</i> It's about you wanting to strike back,</i> and I understand that too. But we've all lost people that we care about. An learn to live with it. I am sure you are aware, Admiral,</i> of the concrete evidence... that Caprica's defenses were compromised by a Cylon agent who infiltrated the Ministry of Defense on the eve of the attacks. People look for complicated answers when something terrible happens. Maybe we were just caught by surprise</i> and were beaten. And maybe we have to learn to live with that. And maybe you are just missing the point.</i> You were infiltrated. You. The military. And you are being infiltrated again right now. You can sit there and pretend you know what you're doing, but you do not. You are being played. And the rest of us do not want to go down with your ship. I want this air system restored right now.</i> One person comes in alone, fixes it, leaves.</i> Anything goes wrong, somebody gets hurt, it's on your head. Keep a direct line open to Cloud Nine. What do we do? We repair the air system. Saul, we can't give her Sharon. I hope you know that, right? I know that. We can't start dealing with the terrorists. We start now, it'll open the floodgates, and it'll never stop. But by the way, it's not "Sharon". It's a frakkin' Cylon. You don't think I know that? I think there's part of you that looks into that thing's eyes and still sees that yo trl that reported aboard two years ago as a rook pilot. Well, it's not. It never was. Bill, it's a machine. Admiral? It's Captain Thrace. Sitrep. I had one of the Cloud Nine techs</i> double-check the oxygen feed in there. There's nothing wrong with the air. Could be a glitch. Or maybe someone screwed with one of the CO-2 censors inrs bar. Lee. Why? Maybe he's giving us an opening.</i> If I can get someone inside, get a clear idea of what we're dealing with- Kara, this is a recon mission. Get someone to volunteer. Then you assess the situation. And then get the hell out of there. Do you understand?</i> Yes, sir. I'm here to repair the O-2 line.</i> Captain, what are you doing? Volunteering. Let me see that. Close the hatch. Search her. You might not want to do that. You're running out of air in here. Looks clean. Do your job. Cover her. Wait a minute. Turn around slowly.</i> Check the box again. We're hot. Let's go. Get down! Get down! We gotta get out! Now! Come on! Billy. Billy. I need shirts, towels- anything I can use as a bandage. Billy! Nobody said you could move. You still want the Cylon? Do you? Because if the admiral's son dies, you're not gonna get a deal, you get that? If he dies, you're not gonna get what you want. He's right. Let him go. Sir, it's Starbuck. We got a report of gunshots. What's happening? My cover was blown. I had to move. I'm sorry. Any casualties? Two marines. Probably KIA... At least one of the gunmen... And Lee. It was crazy in there, confused. He got hit. How bad? I don't know. Stand by. Hold your position. Make no move unless you hear from me. It was friendly fire. Lee got hit by friendly fire. I think it was me. I gotta stop the bleeding. I can't tell if it hit an artery, or... Lee? Don't leave me. Lee, Lee. Don't leave me, okay? Please. Hey. He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay. Just hang in there, come on. Stay with me. Please, stay with me. Are you playing with us? Are you playing with me? I've saved the ship. Saved you. How many times now? Five? Six? You just can't believe I'm not plotting against you. You know that there are Cylons within this Fleet.</i> You know what they look like. You know where to find them.</i> If I were to ask you, would you tell me who they are? No. That I believe. He'll be all right. Thanks for the concern. She loses a husband, and suddenly the world</i> owes her an explanation. He was a good man. And he wasn't just her husband. He was my brother. My brother died on Picon. He was a good man too. They're all good men. The Abinell woman sent over a manifesto to the press</i> before they took over the bar. It's mostly a collection of rumor and conspiracy theories about Cylons in the military and the government. Bunch of crap. It's getting a lot of attention. We gotta get our people out of there. You have Marines on Cloud Nine. Pressure door to the room has been resealed. If we try blowing it open, we'll need so much G-4, we'd risk killing everyone inside.</i> There are no options left except for one. No. We don't strike deals with terrorists. We can't. We give them Sharon Valerii, we're inviting terrorism and we weaken our position permanently, you know that. Gentlemen, everyone in that room is someone's son,</i> someone's wife, someone's mother.</i> Billy is the closest thing that I have to family left in this world. And if you don't think that that... confuses things emotionally for me- Let's not be naive. What if they're right? What if Sharon has been playing us all, plotting our destruction with every passing day? What if the terrorists are right?</i> This isn't about Sharon. It's about something much bigger than that.</i> It's about the long-term survival, it's about the way</i> we conduct ourselves in all of this. Sir? It's Abinell on the line. How's my son? Alive. But my friend is dead. So are two of your soldiers. And your son's dying. You know, I thought a long time about this. About what I'd do... about how far I'd go... And I honestly did not know until this moment... Chu. What? What? Get on your feet. What are you gonna do? Saul, give them what they want! It's just a machine! They're gonna kill her. Hold your fire. I'm giving you the Cylon. But you won't be alive. What does that mean? That is not the deal. It means that you've convinced me</i> that wy have been played. And if that be the case, and she's been playing with me, then I can't take any more chances.</i> So you make up your mind. If you wanShon Valerii, you can have her. But on my terms. I give you the body, you give me the hostages. Done. Cut the wire. Admiral. Let me help. Please. Let me take it from here. Let's go. Stop looking at him, Billy. I can see you watching him. I know you think you can get that gun. I'm only thinking in case something happens. No.</i> You're not a soldier. You're not trained for that. You've got nothing to prove.</i> I know. They're right outside. We open up, they'll give us the body. Okay. We're opening the door. But if anything goes wrong... we start killing hostages. Do it. It's over. Wait- This isn't right. This one's been dead for weeks. Their Cylon is still alive. Kill the girlfriend. Down, report. All clear. I need help over here! Medic! Lee. Lee, can you hear me? Lee! Can you hear me, Lee? Come on, son. Come on, hurry up. That's good. Billy. No. Billy. Is this what you gave 'em? It was a calculated risk. It wasn't worth it. Oh, dear. Well, that's better. That's better. He was so young. Hey. Hey... What is it? Nothing. When you're feeling better, we can talk. This was a hell of a vacation. Yeah. Lee? Lee, you can't leave. You have to stay. You have to really stay. You understand?
