l want a specific place, l want a specific time for a very high-level meeting of the insurgency leadership. And if l don't get it, we pick up Saul again. And this time... he'll lose more than an eye. (man) The child's life must be protected at all costs. The first Cylon-human hybrid. It truly is a miracle from God. We lost her. We did the best we could, but she's dead, and that's all there is to it. She's so beautiful. You understand, Maya, this adoption requires absolute secrecy. You have my word. There's a Raptor out there every day listening for a call, and it's there because the old man isn't gonna leave us to Cylons. "Will make contact this frequency every 12 hours." "Have hope. We're coming for you." Cylons removed launch keys from colonial ships. Location unknown. Best option is that Saul and people on the ground get their hands on the originals. Admiral's decided to put boots on the ground. He wants to send an officer as a liaison to coordinate the rescue op. - Makes sense. What's the problem? - It's who he's sending. This plan is reckless. You are risking the lives of the entire human race. Plan to resume the search for Earth with the <i>Pegasus</i> and the fleet. l'm going back. We round up leaders of the insurgency and we execute them, publicly. We round up groups off the street and we execute them, publicly. Send a message that the gloves are coming off. The insurgency stops now, or else we start reducing the human population to a more manageable size. Let them stretch their legs for a minute. (Jammer) All right. Everybody, out. Five-minute rest break. Come on. Move. You. Over here. Run. Run! Don't look back. Go! (gunfire) - <i>(Ellen)</i> Can l help you? - No. Uh... - There we go. - Thanks. - Sorry. - No, that's all right. It doesn't hurt. l appreciate you doing this. l can't seem to get it right in the mirror. Saul. Um... l want you to know... that l would do anything for you. Yes. (clattering) Cally's on the list. They're gonna kill her. - What list? What are you talking about? - l got this. l got this from the source in the administration. It's a death list, and Cally's name is on it. They're rounding up people in the city. - Cally's already in detention. - This is organised by transport vehicles. Cally's in a group heading for map coordinate x-ray seven. l know, but where the frak is that? How are we going... Calm down, dammit! Think clearly here, Chief, or she's dead. We've already figured out their map-coordinate system. It's referred to on the list of Cylon freqs you got from the last dead drop. Holy frak! You're right. l can extrapolate the coordinate system. Cally's group has to pick up people in town first. That'll take time. Take four men and get there ahead of the trucks. Chief. Pull it together. You won't do her any good if you get caught too. Besides, the last thing your son wants is me and Ellen for parents. Find that list, Chief. (mutters) Where the frak is it? Dammit! Dammit! Where's that frakking list? OK. It's gotta be here. It's gotta be. There. That's it. Think. Come on. Here it is. OK. X-ray seven, one, four, three... Hey, Chief. Good day for a walk, huh? Get two men together. We're going to Pergamus Flats. - Talk to me. - Don't like it. Too much cover on this trail. We could catch enfilade fire from there, there and along there. Let's move out. l'm going to the rendezvous point. Place your men on the ridge for cover. Go, Panthers! C-Bucks rule! Hey, Sam. It's been a while. Funny, l feel like l see you every day. Come on. (Chief whispers) There's the trucks. Move down to the ridge. Move down to the ridge. You, here. This is it. Lock and load. All right. What do we see? Oh, frak me! - <i>(Seelix)</i> What? - They got Laura Roslin and Tom Zarek. - Is there any sign of Cally? - Not yet. Galactica's got a rescue plan in place, ready to go. My job is to get keys for civilian ships still on the ground, then coordinate the rescue with your evacuation plan. When can we meet Tigh? We'll wait till night before we head to the city. There she is. There she is! Oh, my gods! There she is. What the frak's she doing? (Chief) She's making a run for it. The bulletheads are lining up. (Chief) It's a firing squad. Sight in on the Centurions right now. Cally's in our line of fire. If we shoot, we're gonna hit her. Then count to five and open fire. Skin-jobs. Should we take 'em down? Where there are skin-jobs, there are bulletheads. Bring up the RPG. - There's a system of tunnels running... - Shh! Do you hear that? (Sharon) Get back! - Go, go, go! - <i>(man)</i> Get behind the tree line! 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005. - Frak this! We gotta get out of here. - Stay put. Trust me. Now! Thanks. Shh, shh, shh. They were waiting for us, where we thought. Sir, you better take a look at this. l found it on a dead skin-job. It's your handwriting, isn't it? Yeah, damn right it is. We were sold out. Ellen. (man) Check them out. Make sure they're OK. - You all right, Tom? - Yeah. Been a while since l had a woman throw me to the ground. Not quite as much fun as l remember. Hurts, huh? Good. Then l hope it hurts a long, long time till you go to Download City. - You all right down there? - Oh, my gods! It's good to see you, Chief. Good to see you too, ma'am. What happens now? Where do we go from here? We're going home. We're going home. Admiral Adama's on his way. We're getting off this rock. We're going back to <i>Galactica.</i> (baby cries) (baby screams) Don't worry about it, Gaius. - It's all right. It doesn't matter to me. - You can stop that right now, OK? My ego's not so fragile as all that. These things happen... or they don't happen. So what shall we talk about? Shall we talk about your day? How was your day, darling? How was your day at the office? My office. Any news? No? Well, let me tell you about my day, because it was a hoot. l had the most fascinating chat with one of the Dorals. He's got this theory about sanitation being the key to regaining human trust and confidence. Something about... toilet paper. No, lack of toilet paper. That's it. If people could wipe their bums properly, there'd be a measurable uptick in the polls. Four months of this, Gaius. Four months of watching you slip further and further down into this well of self-hatred and loathing. Do you know what l've given up for you? Do you? Do you know, what with the occupation and everything, l can't really say l've given it that much thought recently. Don't go. Please. That doesn't look so bad. Hey, there's something that l wanted to, um, say to you. l'm sorry that l left you alone. l didn't mean for you to get hurt. l was upset with myself and not you, OK? Uh... Grown-ups do stupid things sometimes. We get, uh, caught up in our own little world until it's almost too late. (door closes) You have no idea what l'm saying to you, do you? OK. Time to take a nap. Don't be afraid. l know who you are, what you are. Poor thing. You must be terrified. Do you have any candy? Candy? No. Chamalla's so bitter. Oh, Zeus sees all. Sees you, Number Three. Sees your pain, your destiny. All the gods weep for you. There is no Zeus. No other god but God. Oh, you don't believe that any more. You don't know what you believe, and that is why you're here. It's not true. l don't even know why l'm here. This is the stupidest thing l ever did. It is your dream that brings you to me. How do you know about that? l have a message for you from the one you worship. He speaks through me to you, just as he speaks in your dreams. The message is... the fruit borne of two peoples is alive. A child named after the wife and sister of the all-knowing Zeus. Hera lives. That's not true. The child is dead. You will hold her in your arms and you'll know, for the first time, what it is to feel true love. But you'll lose everything you've done here. Wish l had some chocolate caramels. Let's move! We got some people waiting for their ride down there. Will you quit looking at me like that? Like what? You know like what. Like we're never gonna see each other again. We will. It's a good plan, Dee. Take care of the admiral? Take care of his son. All right, <i>Pegasus</i> crew on the port side of the line, <i>Galactica</i> on the right. "Their enemies will divide them, their colonies broken in the fiery chasm of space." "Their shining days renounced by a multitude of dark sacrifices, yet still they will remain always together." (all) Always together. (man) l'll be back before you know it. - <i>(man #2)</i> See you on the other side. - <i>(man #3)</i> l'll hold you to that. That's the third time you've taken a look at your watch. - Got dinner plans? - <i>(chuckles)</i> No, l was just... l was just thinking. Sharon's probably on the ground by now. l know. These are your orders. You'll find the rendezvous point there. Take the civilian fleet and wait for me for 18 hours. If l'm not back in 18 hours then find Earth. Yeah, right. l'll see you at the rendezvous point. 18 hours. Try not to be late. l'm getting old. l'm a little slow, but l'll be there. Gods, l wish l could talk you out of this. You can't. You tried. - You know, Dad, um... - Don't. Don't make me cry on my own hangar deck. (sighs) l'll see you there. Permission to leave your ship, Admiral. Permission granted, Commander. Attention! Commander of <i>Pegasus</i> departing. 18 hours. (dog barks) Hey. Hey. Jake. Hey, Jake. Yeah, you don't care who l am, do you? All God's creatures in your eyes. Here you go. Can't sleep? Bad dreams. Didn't know you people had dreams. Oh, sure. Everybody dreams, Doc. That human or Cylon blood? Cylon. One of the Fives got pretty shot up today by the insurgents, but he's gonna make it. You could've let him suffer. That's not what l do. What about the baby? Sharon's baby, Hera. When that child died on <i>Galactica,</i> why did you cremate the body? It's the first Cylon-human hybrid, and you threw it in the incinerator? Oh, it wasn't my decision. That was the president's call. l was just following orders. That's a very funny thing. Cos this stuff all looks the same. She said, "l hope it hurts you for a long, long time before you go to Download City." And then they just left me there. They left me in the hot sun with a bullet in my guts. What a noble race you are. How long were you there before you died? Hours. Eventually, l managed to drag myself over to some spent shell casings. l used one of those to scratch open my carotid artery. Skin is a lot tougher than you think. Now that's... three for me. Three downloads. The first, l got a headache, but l could handle it. Now it's worse and worse. This time it was like a frakking white-hot poker through my skull. It's not worth it. None of this is worth it. He's right, you know. It's not worth it, which is what l believe l've been telling you all along. - Caprica, can you please control him? - Why don't you shoot me? If that would remedy the situation. - We need to crack down harder. - How? Resources are stretched already. l don't need to listen to this any more. Consensus used to be so easy. Now look what they've done to us. Don't lose hope. Worst comes to worst, we can always nuke the city and be done with it. Better leave the dog tags. If they spot 'em, they'll know who you are. No. You have no idea how hard l worked for these. So our best guess puts the launch keys in the detention centre. Keep to main streets. Everybody'll think you're a regular skin-job and avoid you. But there's a lot of people looking to gut an unwary Cylon, so don't let anybody get close enough to stick a knife in you. Thanks for the concern. Makes me feel warm inside. How are you gonna find the launch keys? The data stream will feed me the location. Once l get the keys, you need to distribute them to pilots. We're on it. We got pilots standing by. - <i>(man)</i> Hey, Anders! - Yeah, come in. My gods! What's she doing here? Get her down below. You keep her there until after the next briefing. Wait a minute! No, no. Wait, listen to me. Please. l can explain. (Anders) l suggest you keep your mouth shut. (Ellen) l want to speak to my husband. Connor, let's go. Get her down. - OK, l'm outta here. - Wait, Sharon. Yeah. Do me a favour. Just keep an eye out for Starbuck. l don't know if she's alive or if she's dead, but it's been four months. l'll do what l can. Yeah. (Roslin) You must keep the child hidden at all costs. (Anders) We keep her on the move, along with other high-value targets. She'll never stay in any one location longer than two or three days. Sam, l need you to really hear me on this. Really. There is no one - no one - of higher value than Maya and her child. We cannot let them fall into Cylon hands. l get it. How far do you want me to go? If it looks like the Cylons will capture them... No. Don't let it get to that point. That's all. l don't suppose you'll tell me what this is about. What's so important about this kid? She may very well be the shape of things to come. That's either a blessing or a curse. - <i>(baby cries)</i> - l know. Shh. We've stored munitions throughout the city. l can supplement that with mortars, RPGs, shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft missiles aboard the Raptor. Great. So when we give the signal, our people attack the air base, detention centre, power station. The plan is to sow chaos the moment <i>Galactica</i> and <i>Pegasus</i> arrive. - That should help cover the evacuation. - No <i>Pegasus,</i> just <i>Galactica.</i> - Why? Why no <i>Pegasus?</i> - Don't know, sir. Way beyond my pay grade. What about your evac plans? We've assigned 500 block captains to cover each sector. Each captain is responsible for guiding people in his or her sector to their ship. - Have you rehearsed any of this? - <i>(Roslin)</i> Indeed. We've had three dress rehearsals under the guise of fire and disaster drills. Be different when the balloon goes up - explosions, chaos. There'll be panic. They'll do fine. These people know they'll be responsible for saving themselves. All we need to do is be ready and hope for the best. - What about Maya and Isis? - l'm on it. l've got my two best shooters. They're gonna be their escorts and make sure they get back to the ship. l can't tell you why, but it is imperative that this woman and her child get off this planet. l trust you because l trust him. Ma'am, yes, ma'am. Saul! We need to talk. (man hisses) Toaster! - She sold us out. - What? We were ambushed. The Cylons knew exactly where we were gonna be. (both talk at once) This is the map that l drew for you. l gave this to you in your tent. You were gonna burn it. She offered to do it for you. l got it off a dead skin-job at the ambush. Do the math! I... l want to explain, Saul. - Godsdamn traitor! - Shut your frakking mouth! He said... he said he'd kill you. - Who said it? - One of the Brother Cavils. l did it for you, Saul. It was all for you. l had to. l didn't have any choice. Don't you see that? Drawer three-seven-eight. What are you doing? Oh, my God, it's you. You're betraying your own people. For what? - l'm a Colonial officer now. - You're not one of them. - l gave them my word. - That's not what counts. It's who you give it to. l'm gonna have to shoot you now. Hera lives. What? Your daughter Hera is alive. Your new friends tell you that? They faked her death and hid her from you. - You could say anything. - No, l had dreams. l had strange dreams. l was having strange dreams that made me question my faith, made me question God. And in the dreams there was a human oracle, so l went to see Dodona Selloi. l won't kill you. l'll wound you so you can't warn the others. The oracle said that the fruit borne of two peoples is still alive, that Hera lives and l would hold her in my arms and l would know true love. Put down the gun, and when l find her you can hold her too. Adama wouldn't lie to me. You're wrong. You're wrong! The keys don't seem to have been damaged. It looks like the ships have enough tylium to make at least one jump. Congratulations, by the way. l heard it's a boy. - Oh. - What's his name? Nicholas, after Cally's grandfather. Hey, Chief, you remember when you helped Helo spread Hera's ashes? - Mm-hm. - You actually saw the ashes? Yeah, of course. Why? Nothing. Just make sure Cally never lets your kid out of her sight. (Helo) Sir? The listening Raptor just jumped back. Sharon's got the launch keys. (phone rings) Rec room. Racetrack. Very well, sir. It's on. This is the admiral. You've heard the news. You know the mission. You should also know there's only one way that this mission ends, and that's with the successful rescue of our people off of New Caprica. Look around you. Take a good look at the men and women that stand next to you. Remember their faces, for one day you will tell your children and your grandchildren that you served with such men and women as the universe has never seen. And together you accomplished a feat that will be told and retold down through the ages and find immortality as only the gods once knew. l'm proud to serve with you. Good hunting. - Begin jump prep. - Action stations. Set condition one throughout the ship.
