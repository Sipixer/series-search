held perhaps the greatest promise for our survival. - Do you know how to find it? - Not really, no. There was a hope - my hope - that if you knew the way to Earth it would justify keeping you alive a little longer. Now, when l say that l do not know exactly where Earth is, that is not to say l do not know a great deal about its probable location. (Doral) A baseship - the one investigating pulsars and the Lion nebula, we've lost contact. (Number Six) The baseship, it's infected. If an infected Cylon dies and carries this disease into a resurrection ship, it could spread, potentially infecting our entire race. If one of us is resurrected... the disease will follow. Then no Cylon can board that ship without risking infection. l'll go. Yes, l'll go. l can go to the baseship. l can make observations about Cylons, their condition, bring back information about this disease which now threatens all of you. - <i>(Baltar) Do you know what this is?</i> - It must be some kind of... beacon. It must have been left here by the thirteenth tribe. The beacon carried the disease, left by some humans like you to destroy us. You noticed nothing suspicious on the infected ship? Nothing whatsoever. l am just as baffled as you are. Just like the scriptures say... There it is. The Lion's Head nebula and blinking eye. Holy crap! It's the road to Earth! (Apollo) This is combat. Prepped and ready. Plan A. We are approaching the baseship. (Sharon) This is so wrong. What the hell happened here? (Sharon) Whatever this is, it's something new. Go. Apollo, <i>Galactica.</i> You are cleared hot. (Apollo) Roger that, "Galactica". We're in close now, and by the look of it, that ship's in no condition to put up a fight. Never seen anything like this. Shall we proceed? Hang on, guys. (Helo) Use extreme caution, Apollo. (Apollo) Set perimeter. Weapons tight, everyone. Galactica, Apollo. We're in. Galactica, no sign of life. Ship appears to be abandoned and powering down. What the hell? (coughing) (Racetrack) Gods, what happened? (Mathias) l don't know, but their frakking resurrection ship is gonna overheat. Galactica, Apollo. We've reached the control centre. 30, maybe 40, dead skin-jobs. Mathias, set a perimeter! Sharon. Athena! See what you can pick up with the computers. Three fire teams, each doorway. Go. OK, l'm gonna try to call up the database. If l get a connection, put the SSR leads in the water. Reduce the error-correction levels for higher throughput. - <i>(Racetrack)</i> You sure you wanna do that? - It's how it works. (gasps) You OK? Yeah, the data points are almost completely corroded. l don't know if l'm gonna get much out of here, but let's try. What is going on? Frak me! This one's alive! We've got a live one over here! (Mathias) Cover the Major! (Apollo) They're alive! Galactica, Apollo. We got, uh... one, two, three, four... five living skin-jobs down here. l say again, five... five living. - <i>(Helo) Are you taking fire?</i> - Negative. They seem in pretty bad shape. Don't take chances. If they make a move... Oh, you can trust me on that one. Major, what do we do? Should we take 'em out? (Apollo) Hold your fire, hold your fire! - <i>(Mathias)</i> Keep away from the frakkers! - l said, hold your fire! (Cylons moan) (Cylons cough) (Cylon) Grant us strength... (Cylon #2)...wisdom... - <i>(Apollo)</i> What are they doing? - <i>(Cylon #3)...and</i> above all... Hey, Athena, what are you doing? Athena! What are you doing? Athena! Traitor. (Number Six) Save yourself. From what? Get away from us. What happened here? (Number Six) The beacon. (faltering) We brought it... on board. It carried a disease. We're infected. Infected? - Son of a bitch! - OK, OK, OK! Settle down! Keep back! Watch the doorways. Get the doorways! Galactica, Apollo. We have a situation down here. The Cylons have been infected with... a disease. We have all been exposed. We've all been exposed. (Cottle) They'll come aboard under quarantine. Clear a path from the hangar to sickbay, and sterilise it. - And the Raptors, after they're in. - l'll handle that. - How long in quarantine? - l won't know till the blood work. Could be days, weeks. There's no way to tell. They picked up this disease from a beacon? According to the Cylons. Good to have the source of the pathogen. Can you bring it aboard <i>Galactica?</i> No, too dangerous. l want to limit our exposure. - <i>(Cottle)</i> What about the prisoners? - Prisoners? The disease is advanced in their systems, so it'll give me an idea of what to expect as it progresses. And when they die, it'll tell me how long our people have to live. - How many prisoners? - How many you got? (Helo) Apollo, "Galactica". Alpha check. Galactica, we have you in visual range. Approaching starboard hangar. (Helo) Apollo, what was that? (Gaeta) Massive energy discharge from the baseship. - It exploded, sir. - Are you all right out there? Uh, yeah, affirmative. We're still here. - <i>What the hell happened?</i> - Baseship exploded. Self-destructed. You're lucky you got out. Roger that. - <i>(Baltar)</i> Nothing the matter, l trust? - We have some questions. How long have you planned to betray us, Gaius? Funny. - You're joking, of course. - You're making this harder on yourself. Wait a minute. l have been more than very accommodating since l arrived here. l helped you find Sharon's baby. l've helped you with a map towards Earth. We know about the beacon, Gaius. You knew it was out there. You knew it contained a deadly virus. No, l didn't. l didn't. Was the virus created by <i>Galactica?</i> (Number Three) Have you been in contact since you've been on board? Or did you plan this before the evacuation of New Caprica? This is the most profound misunderstanding. Uh, l had nothing to do with the virus or the beacon. Yes. Yes, l did discover it on the baseship, and l should have told you sooner, and l didn't. because l thought, you'd try and link me, you know, to the virus, which is, hello, what's going on right now. l was wrong. It was a mistake, and l fully admit my responsibility. It will never happen again. And l hope you'll accept my most, uh, yeah, my most humble apology. On a brighter note, l have a working theory as to where this beacon may... (clunking footsteps) l'm sorry, Gaius. Things would have been so much simpler had you only told the truth. We think you know more about this virus, and we intend to find out. Relax. Have a drink. l can't. The pain. The pain. It's all in your head, Gaius. Pain, pleasure... they're just neural impulses sent to the brain. You decide how to interpret them. They can be pleasant... or unpleasant. (high-pitched electronic whine) No! No, please! Please! No! (pitch lowers) - l want it to stop, Gaius. - <i>(whining stops)</i> l don't want you to feel this pain. And neither does Caprica. Do you? No. l love you. - You feel anything yet? - Yeah, l feel sick. Sick of you buggin' me. - <i>You</i> didn't touch any infected skin-jobs. - It's not my fault you're clumsy. - You can kiss my infected ass. - You can kiss it, but it's not infected. l got your blood work back. Humans are immune to the virus. You're all healthy. All right, people. Nice job. Let's get outta here. No. You stay put for a while. Yeah! No, no, no, no, no. Please tell me she's OK. - l haven't done her blood work yet. - What? Oh, l see. She can wait because of who she isn't. Sharon. You're gonna be OK. l promise. You come for me, godsdamn it. You come for me the second you know. Take him. He's the furthest gone. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. - <i>(Roslin)</i> You can keep the Cylons alive? - l can't cure them, but yes. - How long? - Indefinitely. l identified the virus. We know it as lymphocytic encephalitis. The disease is carried by rats, mostly. But a couple of hundred years ago, humans developed an immunity. Now l can create a simple vaccine that will dramatically reverse the effect of the virus on the Cylons. But, uh, they have an antibody in their blood which breaks down the RNA of the vaccine. So they will need regular, close-interval injections of the vaccine, or they will die. Can l ask the ugly question here? Is there a reason to keep them alive? We could interrogate them for intelligence. l agree. We have a lot of unanswered questions. OK. But they're not gonna talk. They might if we dangled the vaccine. They don't know it's a stopgap, not a cure. They prayed on the infected ship. Karl's wife said it was something called "The prayer to the cloud of unknowing", whatever that is. Anyway, the point is, she said they only use it when they're facing a death that is final. No possibility of downloading. They're ready to die. Maybe, but it doesn't mean one of them won't jump at a second chance. It infected everything - baseship, Centurions, Raiders - until we were finally abandoned... by the other Cylon ships. Why? Why not just put you under quarantine until they found a cure? Fear... of spreading the disease. They told us that there was a bioelectric feedback component to the pathogen. It corrupts how our brains manage our immune systems. (chokes) If one of us dies... and is resurrected, the disease will follow, infecting the resurrection ship and... and the fleet. Why were you in this area in the first place? We were sent. We were sent here to look for the Lion nebula. Baltar... said it would point the way to Earth. - What did you just say? - Baltar... Baltar's alive? Baltar... is on our baseship. He's helping us find Earth. He's using our navigation charts, along with our map of Kobol. He's leading them to Earth. We... want... a new beginning. Much like you. l gave you i-information. She said that there... there was a cure. Doc Cottle will be... giving you the medicine. - Take him back to the infirmary. - <i>(man)</i> Yes, sir. (Apollo sniggers) What the hell's so funny? l think l just thought of a way to solve all of our problems... to get rid of the Cylon threat for once and for all. We can wipe 'em out. We can destroy the entire Cylon race. We jump to an area we know the Cylons use as a supply line - NCD2539. We stay there, exposed. We look as if we're spoiling for a fight. They'll send a fleet. Where there's a fleet, there's a resurrection ship. And once the resurrection ship is within our reach, we execute our infected prisoners. We bug out. The prisoners download into the ship, and with them, the virus. You sure the virus will download to a new body? The Cylons are sure of it. They left their wounded out here to die alone, with no hope of being rescued. Tells me all l need to know. And once the virus is in the resurrection ship... there will be no stopping it. Rescuers become carriers of the plague. The Cylons themselves don't believe that they'll develop a cure. Oh, my gods. - This could be the end of the Cylons. - Forever. Genocide? So, that's what we're about now? They're not human. They were built, not born. No fathers, no mothers, no sons, no daughters. l had a daughter. l held her in my arms. And she was half-human. These are things. Dangerous things. This is our one chance to be rid of them. You can rationalise it any way you want. We do this, we wipe out their race, then we're no different than they are. (Roslin) Captain, l respectfully disagree. The Cylons struck first in this war and, not content with the annihilation of billions, they pursued us relentlessly through the galaxies to wipe us out. They tried to live with us on New Caprica. - What did you say? - They tried to live with us. You weren't on New Caprica. To my recollection, you didn't set foot there. So out of respect for the men and women who suffered through that snake pit, l'm gonna pretend l didn't hear that. You would serve your fleet well if you'd remember that Cylons are a threat to the survival of humans. l'm talking about right and wrong. l'm talking about losing a piece of our souls. But no one wants to hear that, right? Let's keep it on me. Yeah, l'm married to a Cylon... who walked through hell for all of us how many times? And she's not half anything, OK. How do we know there aren't others like her? She made a choice. She's a person. They're a race of people. Wiping them out with a biological weapon is a crime against... is a crime against humanity. But they're not human. They're programmed. We will take your input under advisement. Thank you both. Thank you, ma'am. Dismissed. (electronic whine) (pitch heightens) l can help you. l can guide you through the torment, but you'll have to do the work. l'll do anything. Anything! Then tell us what we want to know. How was the virus invented? Did they make a cure? (Number Six) Look at me. Look at me. When you make love to me, Gaius, you don't always think about me. Your mind wanders. l know that. You think of equations, puzzles, your laundry. It's the nature of the mind to disconnect from the body and journey on its own. Separate your mind from your body. Keep your mind in that room. Use your intellect against her. Reason, logic, analysis. Find the holes in her psyche. l can't. Pain... Pain's only in your body, so keep your body here with me. Don't worry. l'll take care of it. (whining slows) (Number Three) You see, Gaius, this is what the absence of pain feels like. It's easy to forget. l had nothing to do with the virus. It was a coincidence. There's no such thing as coincidence. God wills the universe according to his design. (Number Six) Now, focus on her... as a Cylon, not a woman. Be a scientist. Examine her faith. What's your analysis, Doctor? l'm a scientist. And as a scientist, l believe that if God exists our knowledge of him is imperfect. Why? The stories and myths we have are the products of men, the passage of time. The religion you practise is based on a theory, impossible to prove, yet you bestow it with absolutes like, "There is no such thing as coincidence." It's called faith. Absolute belief in God's will means there's a reason for everything. Everything! And yet... you can't help but ask yourself how God can allow death and destruction, and then despise yourself for asking. But the truth is, if we knew God's will, we'd all be gods, wouldn't we? l can see it in your eyes, D'Anna. You're frustrated. You're conflicted. Let me help you. Let me help you change. Find a way to reconcile your faith with fact. Find a way towards a rational universe. l don't know what your game is, but it's not going to work. You intentionally led one of our ships to that beacon, didn't you? Give your body to me. Only your mind is there. Feel me. Feel this where she wants you to feel pain. Look at me. Look at me, Gaius. Do you want me to believe you're worth saving? Do you? Do you? Say it. l want you to believe in me. Don't stop! Don't stop! Please, please, don't stop. You have to believe in me. You're all l have left. (moans) Now tell me you believe in me. Tell me you believe in my strength. l believe in you! l believe in you. l love you. l love you with all my heart. l love you with all my heart. How? Cottle said it had something to do with carrying a half-human child. How the foetal cells enter the maternal circulatory system, causing the mother to create antibodies. Whatever. l'm immune! Oh, my gods. Our baby... saved my life. She's gone forever, and she saved my life. Hera kept us together. - To share this. - This? You mean us? Together? You mean us? Them. Them. l mean them. Who's "them?" They're gonna execute the infected prisoners. But not until we jump into a Cylon region with a resurrection ship present. The infection's gonna spread everywhere. - There's a point l'd like to make. - Mm-hm? The law forbids me to use biological weapons without a presidential order. Which means you're passing the buck. On this one, yes. Helo's right on one thing. We start destroying entire races, even mechanical races, we're liable to tear off a piece of man's soul. The Cylons are coming to Earth. If they find us, they are coming for us. Those are the stakes. They always have been, Bill. We're talking about the genocide of your entire race. Yeah. You think l don't know that? l made a choice... to wear a uniform, to be a person. You were a person before you put on that uniform. OK? You were a person before l fell in love with you. - You don't have to prove that. - l have to prove it every day. Let me tell you something, Helo. My people may die. My entire race may be wiped out. But this Cylon will keep her word, even if it means she's the last Cylon left in the universe. Can a human being do that? Posterity really doesn't look too kindly on genocide. (Roslin) You're assuming that posterity will define this as genocide. If they do, at least there'll be someone alive to hate us for it. The Cylons are our mistake, we created them. All right, Admiral. As president, l have determined the Cylons be made extinct. The use of biological weapons is authorised. So say we all. So say we all. Jump complete. DRADIS is clear. No Cylons, sir. They'll be here soon enough. Get our birds in the air. Commence Viper and nav Raptor launch. Let's do this, Racetrack. (shouting) Move 'em back. Go. Move, move. Come on. CAP is away. Nav bird has them on DRADIS. DRADIS contact. A pair of Cylon Raiders. Keeping their distance for now. Didn't take 'em that long. They're just scouts. They'll jump away and report back to their fleet. Let's see if they take our bait. Got it. There's a resurrection ship with them. (Adama) Then it's time to execute our Cylon prisoners. Call it in. Terminate the prisoners. - Head shots, OK? - Yes, sir. Let's do it. All right, let's see if we can't frak up some toasters on this joy ride, people. (Hotdog) l'm notching like hell! Hotdog, Starbuck. Quit your bitchin' and continue to cover as fragged. Out of the way. Frak! They're already dead. They're... they're already dead. Sir, you should hear this. (Apollo) They were dead before the ship was in range. They didn't download the disease. We've missed our window. (Starbuck) A baseship just jumped in. Call our birds in. Spool up. Let's get the hell outta here. Commence FTL. Sir, we lost time. We're gonna take significant fire while we spool up. Continue jump. Take us back to our fleet. Yes, sir. They'll be coming for me. You or me. Seems like they're always coming for one of us... l'm not a traitor. l love my people. l love this ship. Besides you, the first thing l wanna see on any morning are the lights in that CIC. l did what l thought was right. If it was a mistake, fine. l can live with that. It's you l can't live without. l'll always love you, Helo. Mm. No, thanks. The prisoners died of asphyxiation. The air-purification system was reversed. It sucked the oxygen out. When this happens, the deadbolts are automatically activated on the door. - Someone did this manually. - Someone? Seems to me there's only one or two likely suspects. - Who will head the investigation? - No one. l'm closing the book on this. How convenient. Cottle's report on the virus. He thinks that it was simply an accidental contamination of the beacon we abandoned on the sick baseship. Somebody sneezed, maybe. Yeah, an entire race almost wiped out because someone forgot to wipe their nose. According to Cottle, the virus was an exact match to one reported over 3,000 years ago. Right around the time that the thirteenth colony left Kobol. That beacon... was a signpost to Earth. l think we're on the right trail, Laura. Yes, we are on the right trail, Bill.
