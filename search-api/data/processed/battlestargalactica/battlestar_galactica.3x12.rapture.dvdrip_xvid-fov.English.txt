but the star in this system is highly unstable - on the verge of going supernova. We just picked up four baseships inbound at high speed. It's just a matter of time until the Cylons find out what we're up to on this planet. (screams) Starbuck is going down. - l am going after my wife! - l can't let you... l am not asking you for permission. Sergeant Mathias... What if l told you your daughter was alive? l'd say you were a liar. She's on our baseship. She's ill, and we don't know why. l don't know how l found this place. l got this urge to start walking, then suddenly... Here it is. The scriptures say that this temple is the final resting place of the Eye of Jupiter. - What exactly are we talking about? - It's a marker left behind by the thirteenth tribe. It's supposed to point the way to Earth. We want the Eye of Jupiter. Make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planet's surface, l'll launch every nuke l've got. You've got to hold off the Cylons until the chief finds the Eye of Jupiter. If it looks like they're going to get into the temple, blow it. We have to go to the planet. l am so close to seeing the faces of the last five Cylons. The Final Five, revealed only to those who enter the temple. Only to the Chosen One. We just picked up six heavy Raiders heading for the planet. Order ground-strike missiles. l'm not gonna let the Cylons get their hands on the Eye. Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee? Missiles are loaded, Admiral. Release of nuclear weapons is now authorised. Mr Gaeta, disable launch and warhead safeties on tubes four through ten. Safeties disabled, warheads... - <i>(bleeping)</i> - <i>...are</i> armed. XO, please input your firing code. These nukes will obliterate anything or anyone within 20 clicks of the temple. l know. He's going to do it. Recall the Raiders immediately. We agree. Bring them back. We agree. After all this time, we can't afford to lose everything. We agree. Bring them back. If Kara dies out there, l swear to gods l will kill you myself. If she dies out there, l'll let you. What will you do now? Follow me around with a gun? Because that is the only way that l am not going after Kara. - Private Sykes. - Sir. - Get Lieutenant Dualla on the line. - Yes, sir. - l'm here. - Do you have eyeballs on Starbuck? Negative. No visual on her Raptor, but l can see smoke from the crash site. She went down behind a hill a couple of clicks away. - Can you get to the Raptor? - l don't know. It's pretty far away. - There's minimal cover. - Is it doable? l don't know. The key. - Standing by. - <i>(bleeping)</i> Launch sequence set to auto. They want the key to finding Earth as much as we do. - He won't just destroy it. - We spoke and the decision's been made. Fire on my mark. Sir! The Raiders are turning back. - Not all of them. - Correction. Five have turned back. One is still en route back to the planet. - What are you doing? - They won't launch against just one ship. That's not the issue. We made a decision. D'Anna has to turn back. - No. - <i>(Number Six)</i> Call D'Anna and Baltar. - Turn them around now. - No. What do you mean, "No"? This is something that we have to do. He won't launch over one ship. You'll see. You want me... you want me to rescue Captain Thrace? Attempt the rescue. Yes, sir. Foxfire One out. We go. (Gaeta) Weapons are still hot, Admiral. Safe all missiles. Close outer doors. There. You see? Never over just one ship. That is not a good sign, my friends. She defied us, defied the group. It's not about the Eye of Jupiter, it's about her. It's like we don't even know them any more. We may have to do something about this. We may have to do it sooner than later. If Hera's alive, l'm her mother and l'm going to get her. Sharon, baby, listen to me, OK? We can take a Raptor and fly to the baseship ourselves. l don't care any more. We can't. We'll find another way. We will. There is no other way. Don't ask me to do this, Sharon. Listen to me. You have always been the strong one. You believed in us when no one else would. l'm begging you to do this. Find the courage to do this for both of us, OK? l love you. l love you too. Ohh. (drops weapon) (weeps) (yells) Good to close her. - Wait outside. - Yes, sir. Sharon's downloading into another body aboard a Cylon ship right now, isn't she? She begged me. She begged me to do it. Gods, if you'd... seen the look in her eyes when I... She has important information on our defences. Codes, procedures. The tactical situation down on the planet surface. The Cylons have access to all of that as well. She won't betray us. You know that. It's why you gave her the uniform. She may not have a choice. Did you consider that? She said she could resist, that she wouldn't let it happen. She'll get Hera... and she'll come back. That's quite a leap of faith you've made there, Captain. And if it involved your family only, l'd say it was brave. But you've put the entire fleet in jeopardy. Are you aware of that? If you hadn't lied... and stolen our baby in the first place, we wouldn't be here at all. l've certainly played my part in bringing us to this moment. And there is plenty of blame to throw around, and l accept it. And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon. All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain. And you as well, Admiral. (Sharon gasps) (coughing and spluttering) Can you tell me what happened? They wouldn't let me see my daughter... so my husband shot me. It was the only way. Well, it's over now. The important thing is that you're here. How's my daughter? - She's getting worse. - l wanna see her. And then what? What they did to me. Stealing my baby... and telling me she was dead. It proved it. Hera's safer here. And so am I. Before she went down, Starbuck spotted about 15-plus chrome-jobs advancing on us from here. To get to us, they have to come through this canyon. This is a natural choke point. That's where we'll ambush them, guerrilla-style. Our mission is to hold the temple, here. If we fail we blow it up. We fall back to these rendezvous points, and then we head into the mountains, and we wait for rescue. It's as good a place as any to die, l suppose. What do you think? It's a nice day for a walk. - (gunshots) - Sniper! Hey, take it easy, Fischer. Sarge? Sarge? (gunfire) Oh, this is crazy. Come on. Think. Think! Galen, it's Major Adama. - Sir. - Chief, we're in position. Any luck finding the Eye of Jupiter? No. Major, l need more time. Get on it. The Cylons are on the move. We'll hold them off as long as we can. Apollo out. All right, listen up! Pack your gear and get ready to move. (man) Let's get out of here. - It's so close. - l know. The answers to all your questions are down there in that temple. What's wrong? l'm worried, Gaius. This is what we've been waiting for. You are the anointed one, chosen by God to look on the faces of the Final Five Cylons. It's already written. You will succeed. That's what l'm afraid of. To know the face of God is to know madness. The hybrid has looked into the space between life and death, and she's seen things that we cannot conceive of. But she's been driven mad as a result. Have faith in God. Put your life in his hands. He will guide you to your destiny. l'm grateful to you. For everything. Her destiny will part company from yours, Gaius. She's not the Chosen One. You are. Yes, l know. l know. Right here. Got it? (Apollo) OK, we're set. And now we wait. What happens if the Cylons don't dance to the major's tune? We get splattered all over these rocks. Shut up. This is his game, not ours. We just do what we're told, and maybe we get outta here. You really think these civvies can stop 'em? They stopped plenty of 'em on Caprica while we were running for our lives. OK. Three clankers just entered our kill zone. - Gotta be their recon element. - Sykes, give 'em the signal. All right, show time. Show time. All right, they're headed our way. Don't detonate till they're all the way in. Wait for it. Come on, you sons of bitches. Come on. Now, now, now. (Hope) Godsdammit! Cease fire! They're pulling back! They're pulling back! Godsdammit! Come on! He's dead. We gotta pull him back. Sam! Pull it together. We bought ourselves a little time. But they'll be back, and with force. So, dig in. We need to hold 'em off until Chief finds the Eye. And keep your eyes out on those ridges. Have you had any word from Kara or Dee? No. (thud) Starbuck? Starbuck! Dee, why the hell didn't you sing out? l almost blew you away. Glad to see you, too. OK, OK. It's OK. - Lee sent you? - Yup. My husband... ordered me to risk my life for yours. That's what l'm gonna do. l'm gonna bring Starbuck back to Apollo. (baby crying) She's here. (crying continues) It's me. It's Mommy. What's wrong? (crying stops) We tried everything. She didn't respond. Look at that. Hera knows her. That's amazing. You and she are biologically identical. Hera recognises her mother. Good. Because you can have her. l'm done with her. You don't mean that. l know you still care about Tyrol, and Adama. No. l'm done with that part of my life. l learned that on New Caprica. Humans and Cylons, we're not meant to be together. We should just go our separate ways. Now lie down. Her belly is as hard as a rock. Have you noticed that before? (Hera cries) - What do you think that means? - Blocked intestine, maybe. Our doctors examined her. Your doctors have never examined a child. (crying continues) Hera needs to be seen by a human doctor. l need to take her back to <i>Galactica.</i> You know that can't happen - what this child means to us, - what she means to every Cylon. - l should have known. She's been planning this all along. Feel her. She's right. - Her belly's as hard as a gourd. - If you don't let me take her, the first of the new generation will die. - God will never forgive you. - Maybe Cavil's right. Maybe God never wanted us to have children in the first place. Maybe it'd be better for you if l just snapped your little neck! Please... Please don't kill my baby girl. Honey! l believe the future of the Cylon rests with this child, and the others who are gonna come after her. - So do I. - There's a captured Raptor aboard. Let's go. We've gotta get you back to <i>Galactica.</i> Here they come. Open fire! Cover the wounded! The Cylons are closing in! - It's the major. - Tyrol. - Tell me you've found the Eye of Jupiter. - We're getting close. l deciphered some more of the glyphs. l got a reference to an eye, a star, and an explosion of some kind. Cut to the chase, Chief. Do you have the Eye of Jupiter in your hands or not? No, Major. That's it! It's hot. All right, Chief, listen to me. That's it. Get your people to the rally point and blow the temple. Repeat, blow the temple. Yes, sir... Dammit. All right, fall back! Sykes! Mathias! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back! All right, that's it. Everybody drop what you're doing and get out. - <i>(man)</i> Keep that one. - That means you too, Cally. Come on! - Leave the gear! Go! - Come on. (Cally) l've got it. - If l only had a little more time. - Galen! It's in the hands of the gods now. Let's go, There's nothing we can do. The ship's structure's intact. OK. That means the only thing keeping us grounded is a busted fly-by-wire, so... you've gotta bypass those bundles with data cord from the com system, and then we... we may have a shot at getting out of here. (groans) There's only one left. Better save it for when you fly us out of here. l can't fly. - Especially all whacked up on morpha. - Well, that's just frakking great. He won't cheat. He's too honourable. Unlike you. Yeah, unlike me. l love Sam, l hate Sam. l love Lee, l hate Lee. The gods l have to cheat just to keep the pieces all nice and neat. Stay with it. You've still gotta walk me through these avionics. The Cylons have reached the temple. Chief, what's your status? l'm wiring the last detonator. (D'Anna) The Eye of Jupiter has be somewhere in this temple. They've wired it with explosives. Let's disconnect it. Pull out the detonators. Quickly! Chief, blow this thing! Are you out of your frakkin' mind?! l can't do it. - Gaius! - Yes? Help us! Here. Give me that control! This just about does it... Frak! What have you done? What have you done? Major, look. (Apollo) What is that? There it is, Gaius. It has the answers to all of your questions. That's the Eye? - What is? - Oh. Uh... Something the hybrid said. Uh... "Sapphire blue, shining like unto a star..." D'Anna... You didn't come here looking for Earth, you came here looking for something else. (explosion) l'm picking up a massive energy pulse. Sir, it's a helium flash. The star's going nova. Novas can obliterate the entire planet in less than an hour. Major, look. It's the mandala from the temple. This is supposed to be happening. That's it. l was staring at it the whole time. The sun is going nova. The nova is the Eye of Jupiter. All right. We can still blow it. We can still blow it. We just gotta make it into orbit and Galactica will find us from there, OK? This is my destiny. To see what lies between life and death. And to look upon the faces of the Final Five. That can't happen. This is my destiny. Sorry, D'Anna. (gunshot) The Final Five. Is it really you? You. Forgive me. l had no idea. No idea about what? What did you see? What? Who was it? Oh, beautiful. What was? Tell me! Am l one of you? You were right. About what? D'Anna, did you see my face? l have to know. Please. Please, stay with me. Stay! l have to know! Tell me! l have to know! Did you see my face? Am l a Cylon? Frak it. God, tell me the truth before l die. Welcome home, Mr President. Admiral, the Cylon fleet just jumped away. They don't want to be here when that nova shock front gets here. Neither do we. - Launch a rescue mission now. - That nova will fry the whole system. It's gonna be a photo finish. - All rescue ships accounted for. - Count us down. - Commence FTL. - Commencing FTL. (Gaeta) Jump in three... two... one... l got it. - He's not dead? - No, unfortunately. Take him to the brig. Sharon. We have to get her to Doc Cottle right away, OK? - OK. - <i>(guard)</i> Stick up! Hold your fire, hold your fire. - She helped us escape. - Get out of the way! Dammit. Sharon. l think the chief is right. l think the nova does look like the mandala inside this temple. Do you think the thirteenth tribe had a vision of what was to come? - l don't know what else it could mean. - They saw another nova and drew that? - See one nova, you've seen them all. - Well, there was another nova. Seen 4,000 years ago, round about when the temple might have been built. It's 13,000 light years from here, a cloud of gas known as the Ionian nebula. Maybe it was a road sign... showing the direction that they headed to next. So, Starbuck, is that what you gotta do to get some actual rack time around here? - Did you just come by to frak with me? - l wanted to know if you had any, uh... pictures of your old apartment on Caprica. Um... Yeah. Uh... The locker. Top shelf, there's a cigar box. - Why? - l'm curious about something. l hope you aren't planning on redecorating. You're not gonna get any bright ideas from my old place. Oh, l remember. - l've seen better-Iooking train wrecks. - Oh, thank you. But l do remember those paintings you did. What about 'em? This... was on the temple. Where'd you get the idea to paint yours? l don't know. It's just something l've been doodling since l was a kid. l liked the pattern. Well... They built the temple 4,000 years ago. What is it? It's just something Leoben said once. That l had a destiny. That it had already been written. (groans) You know the drill. Long, deep, controlled breathing. At least you'll never have to go through this again. The decision wasn't easy, but the conclusion was inevitable. Your model is fundamentally flawed. No. It's not a flaw to question our purpose, is it? To wonder who programmed us, the way we think, and why. That's the problem right there - the messianic conviction that you're on a special mission to enlighten us. - Look at the damage it's caused. - l would do it all again. Yes, we know. That's why we've decided to... box your entire line. Your consciousness, memory, every thought your model ever had, - going into cold storage, indefinitely. - One must die to know the truth. There are five other Cylons, Brother. l saw them. One day you're going to see them too. One day... Goodbye. Brother... Brother... Brother.
