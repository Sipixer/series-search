what to make of you and me. I'm having trouble - accepting this. - We have to push forward. Keep the fleet together. Find Earth. 3,600 years ago, Pythia wrote about the exile and the rebirth of the human race. And the Lords anointed a leader to guide the caravan of the heavens to their new homeland. I came back with D'Anna to be with my people. Because you're one of the Five. You're one of the Final Five. Turns out there's another kind of Cylon we didn't know about, - and I'm one of them. - Corporal! Get it out of my sight! Put your hands on your heads and face the Viper. Do it now! - What the hell is going on? - They're Cylons. There's something different about this Viper. Something's changed. You gotta find it. That's a colonial emergency locator signal. So you're all in agreement this is the way to Earth? It's a stretch, but it's the best explanation we've got. So the question is, where do we go from here? We go to Earth together. Earth. -=( Lords of Kobol )=- Admiral. Our scouts say the same all over the planet. No answers to our hails. No signs of human life. It's the same report we got from ours. This signal's pretty weak. The emergency locator battery must be running low on juice. It was probably on for a long time. Low level radiation. Definitely in the water and the food chain. Put word out not to eat or drink anything down here. Baltar just confirmed it. The planet was nuked about 2,000 years ago. It squares with what our teams have been finding all over the planet. It's perfect. We traded one nuked civilization for another. Let's get out of here. Just don't give up. Just don't give up. Don't fall apart. Easy, Dee. Take it easy. Get me out of here. Madam President! Is Earth really a wasteland? Is there anything at all? The president will be making a statement in due course. You will find out everything in good time. It's colonial. It's standard on all aircraft. Part of our inertial nav system. "757-NC." Kara, what is it? What does it mean? The number on my ship is 8757-NC. - I'm gonna get her! - Hello! No, stop! I'm gonna go into the table! Raptor's down! Appreciate it, Dee. You kidding? I look forward to this. I look forward to this. We'll be back soon, okay? Thanks, Dee. Bye, baby! You have no idea what's happened, do you? Today is just another day. Hey, over here! What is it? We found a couple of these scattered among the bones in sites around the planet. Centurions. Similar, but they're not one of ours. We've never seen this design. So the Thirteenth Tribe settled here and created their own Cylons. And then the machines rose up and killed their masters. That's what we thought. Until we tested the bones. 250 skeletons so far. From four different sites on the planet. - Using our protocols... - The results are conclusive. - What's your point? - They're not human. They're Cylon. All of 'em? All of them. The Thirteenth Tribe was Cylon. The Thirteenth Tribe, the tribe of Cylons, came to this planet and called it Earth. Madam President, what do we do about the Quorum? You need to talk to them. We need to tell them something. It should come from their president. Carry the ball. Bill, we need to talk. There's a lot of things I gotta explain. If my Viper's splattered all over this planet, then who flew it here? And what the hell did I fly back to Galactica? Maybe it's better off not knowing. You're always telling me to face the truth and not run from it. Why the sudden change of heart? I've got a feeling... - You might not like what you find. - For me or you? There you are. The Raptor's ready to take you back to Colonial One. What are you doing in here? I was just thinking. About all the pilots who sat in those seats. Gave their lives for a dream of a new beginning on Earth. I don't want their sacrifice to be meaningless. You've got that look again. What look? The one you had when your father took Galactica back to New Caprica. We stayed behind on Pegasus with the civilian fleet. You thought you'd never see him again. That easy to read, huh? Just to me. There were some good times for us, weren't there, on Pegasus? Yeah. I remember what you told me. We had to keep the human race going. And you did. No, we did. I couldn't have done it without you, Dee. You will this time, too. I don't know how. I don't know what the frak I'm gonna tell the Quorum. Good news is... Real estate prices are low. Truth is, there is no happy way to spin this thing. So don't. Tell them the truth. That's what people need to hear, and they need to hear it from you. If anybody can give them a reason to go on... it's you, Apollo. Would you... I was gonna grab a drink around 19:00. Would you join me? It's a date. Help me, godsdamn it! If you've got an explanation for this, now's the time. I don't have one. I was wrong. About Earth. Your hybrid... told me something. Said that I was the harbinger of death. That I would lead us all to our end. She told you that? Is it true? Is it true? If that's me lying there, then what am I? What am I? What am I? "So let us not talk falsely now "'cause the hour is getting late." You remember something? Yeah. I used to live here. Me too. That song that switched us on? I played it. For a woman I loved. I remember. You do? You played it for all of us. That was me. We died in a holocaust. Then why are we still alive? That happened 2,000 years ago. How did we get to the colonies? Come to think that we were human? 2,000 years is a long time to forget. We gotta do something. Morale is going down the toilet. What are you doing? The pythian prophecy. Cottle told me that you didn't show up for your Doloxan treatment. That's right. Do you want to tell me why? I didn't feel like it. You're gonna reschedule. I don't think so. Laura, you need your treatments. No, I don't. What are you doing? You just gonna... lie down and quit? - You made me believe in this. - You shouldn't have listened to me. When the Cylons first attacked, you should've held your ground and kept fighting. Because I was wrong. I was wrong about everything. And all those people who listened, and they trusted me, and they followed me, all those people... They're dead. - That's not... - Don't, stop. Don't touch me. Just go. Burn. Burn. Tell me again. - You've heard it three times, Dee. - I want to remember every word. All right, I said, "Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a choice. "We can either view this as a catastrophe "or an opportunity. "I, Lee Adama... "ex-acting president, former commander of the obliterated Battlestar Pegasus, "Apollo to my friends, I choose the latter. "We're no longer enslaved by the ramblings of Pythia. "No longer pecking at the breadcrumbs of the Thirteenth Tribe. "We are now free to go where we want to go... "and be who we want to be." I'm so proud. I think I managed to stall a full scale panic, but I got no idea what to do next. That is the best fun I have had... In a long, long time. Thank you for that. - What? - You're glowing. Am I? All I can think of is that waste of a planet. Please. I just want to hang on to this feeling for as long as I can. Look at that. Little Anna's got her smile back. Sometimes I don't even remember that's me. It's so long ago. She has no frakkin' idea what's ahead of her. None of us do. Oh, my gods, help! No, no, no, it's gonna be okay. - We need a medic. - She's gonna be okay. We need a medic here! We need a medic! Frak. Medic! She kissed me good night 45 minutes ago, and there was... joy in her eyes. So tell me why would she do this? I don't frakkin' know. No. What did you do? I let you down. I let everybody down. - Give me your sidearm. - Sir? Frakkin' now! - Leave it loaded. - Yes, sir. I think we should have that little heart to heart you've been pining for. Sit down, Cylon. Looks like you've got a head start on me, Bill. And it looks like you still don't know when to shut your frakkin' mouth and follow orders. Bill, I am so sorry that I didn't have the guts to tell you when I first found out. Frak you! You got no guts. You're a frakkin' machine. Is that how it worked? They program you to be my friend? Emulate... all the qualities I respect. Tell me jokes... and I'd laugh at them. Bill... I was your friend because I chose to be. I wanted to be. Ah, Ellen. Yeah, you know, Ellen was smarter than I gave her credit for. - Don't go there, Bill. - Smarter than me. She knew from the beginning that there was something wrong with you. That's why she went around frakkin' half the colonial fleet. - Shut your mouth! - Searching out, trying to find a man who had real blood in his main vein. Shut your frakkin' mouth! She came on to me once. Like a dog in heat, I could smell. I could smell it... she smelled so good. Go on, do it, do it, do it! Or I will. Go on, go on. Do it. Go on. Oh, my Gods. That's why you came here. To do this. You haven't got the frakkin' guts to do it yourself. I'm sorry, Bill. This is one time I can't help you. I think we've both had enough. Did I ever tell you about my summers with my uncle when I was a kid? Foxes... would attack his henhouse all the time. Really pissed him off. He'd wake me up. We'd go with his hounds at night up into the hills looking for the fox. When the dogs smelled the scent, they'd go crazy. The pack would become a team. Forced the fox... toward the river. So what would the foxes do? Half would turn and fight. The other half would try to swim across. But my uncle told me about a few that... They'd swim halfway out, turn with the current, and ride it all the way out to sea. Fishermen would find them a mile offshore just... swimming. Because they wanted to drown. Maybe. Or maybe they were just... tired. Well, godsdamn it, Bill. We can't swim out to sea. I am the XO of this ship. You are the commanding officer. How is putting a bullet in your head gonna help Dee? It is sure as frak isn't gonna help all the others who are thinking about doing the same godsdamn thing. And what are they gonna do without the old man here to lead them? Lead them where, Saul? I hear you lost the signal. You couldn't find the source. I need to talk. I've gotta... tell somebody. You look like hell. What's going on? What about Dee? She shot herself. My Gods. I don't understand. No, neither do I, you know. I'm trying to come up with a neat answer. But truth is, I'll never know. 'Cause it's too frakkin' late. Mr. Hoshi. Take over for Lieutenant Dualla. Mr. Gaeta. Find me the closest G, F or K class star system. Get the Cylon baseship on the horn. See if our new allies want to come along for the ride. Men and women of the fleet. This is the admiral. The discoveries of the past few days have been painful for all of us. As you know, we cannot stay on Earth. But this is not a new challenge. The Thirteen tribes of Kobol stood exactly on the same spot that we are right now.</i> They experienced dreadful losses. Their planet was a graveyard. They needed a home. So they set out in the void of deep space</i> with nothing but their ships and their guts.</i> And the Thirteen succeeded. They weren't supermen. They were ordinary people like us. What they can accomplish, we can accomplish. We will find a new home. This is a promise I intend to keep. All right, people, pack it up. We're off this rock in 15 minutes. You'd better get back to your ship. The fleet is about to jump. I'm not going. You know, all this is just gonna happen again and again and again. So I'm getting off this merry-go-round. I'll die here with my ancestors, and it beats the hell out of being out there with Cavil. Gonna die in the cold and the dark when Cavil catches up with us. Well, I wouldn't count the old man out. He'll find us a home. Don't you ever want to stop fighting it, colonel? Don't you just want to stop all of this? And just ride the tide out to sea. Saul! I'll get you out! It's okay. It's okay. Everything is in place. We'll be reborn...
