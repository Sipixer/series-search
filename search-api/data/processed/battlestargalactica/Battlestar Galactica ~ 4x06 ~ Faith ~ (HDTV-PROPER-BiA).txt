are you taking Chamalla again? I am taking Chamalla again because my cancer has returned. I remember a flashing triple star, a giant gas planet with rings, and a comet. What's the latest, Felix? She's reversing course. Returning to sector seven. - That is the tenth course correction. - Frak me. They're going to attack. Alert the others. We need to jump now. Just remember, - <i>they </i>started it. - But we're killing them. We are truly killing them. Dradis contact. I've got visual. Cylon heavy Raider. Kara, I'm alone. This is not an attack. - <i>I knew I'd find you.</i> - Leoben. I'm here for you. To offer a truce between human and Cylon and a chance for you to complete your journey.</i> The Hybrid. You need to go to her, Kara. She'll tell you the way to get to Earth. We're done here. Get him out of here. This baseship was never part of the mission. If we don't leave right now, we are all going to die. We're ready to jump back on your order. - We're not going back to the fleet. - What are you talking about? We came to complete a mission, that baseship has something to do with it. Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius, I'm hereby relieving you of command. You son of a bitch. I'll do it myself. - What the hell are you doing?! - Stand down! Order the marine guards to the control room. Tell them I'm placing Captain Thrace under arrest. You're wrong, Helo. You're so godsdamn wrong. Either way, we're taking Leoben and his proposal back to the fleet. The Admiral will sort it out. You're throwing away our last chance to find Earth. And you'll be going back to Galactica as mutineers. How do you think the Admiral's gonna sort through that? That's up to him. M. Gaeta, reset the FTL for the first jump back to the fleet. Right away, Sir. - We should just airlock your Cylon ass. - I am not a Cylon. Gaeta, stop! Gaeta, abort the jump! I said, abort the jump! Frak. You want to know who's in charge? Who's in command? - You frakkin' want to know?! - Sam! It's Captain Thrace, Gods damn it! Now let her go! Sergeant, stand down. - Stand down, Sergeant! - Medic! Stand down, Sergeant! That's an order! Seelix, stand down! Stand down. What the frak? - I need a med kit! - Stay away from me. Frak! What the frak? All right, bloodstopper. This is gonna hurt. Ready, go. Get off me, you frakkin' bitch... Morpha. We need to move him to a bunk. - Marines, get over here! - Yes, Sir. - Easy. - Careful! Wait, listen. Kara, that was... So now what? Gonna give orders at gunpoint? You're right, Helo. I never should've ordered Demetrius to jump to the baseship. Too many lives to risk on a gut instinct. - So Demetrius goes back to the fleet. - Missing a Raptor. I'm gonna take Leoben to the baseship, see if his story checks out. Are you insane? The two of you alone? She's not going alone. I'm going with her. This is crazy, but I need you. What? I need someone speaking their language. If this is a trap, I want to know about it. Hell, yeah, let the Cylon go. It's okay. I'll do it. Listen to me. Your Raptor doesn't have enough fuel to get back to Galactica. But the baseship does. We were sent out here by the Admiral to complete a mission. Not for me, but for the people of the fleet. And if I'm right, the payoff is Earth. Lieutenant Costanza, what's the latest we can leave here and still make the rendezvous with the fleet? Window closes 15 hours and seven minutes. And that's cutting it really damn close. Set the clock to 15 hours and 7 minutes and start it. We'll be waiting here till the clock runs out. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA Season 4 - Episode 6 Subtitles - =( Team Lords of Kobol )= - Transcript - =( Swsub.com )= - - =( SadGeezer.com )= - Thanks, insults, critics... - =( www.seriestele.net )= - - =( Team Lords of Kobol )= - So I guess just pack up everything that's here. Pack up all of these drafts. I will have plenty of time on my hands over the next couple of days, so pack it up. At least the worst is over. 2 more Doloxan treatments and you will be over the hump. And I'm gonna need you to... Really keep an eye on things until then. Don't worry. I'll make sure our friend from Picon sees the error of his ways. I'm not just talking about the Quorum, Tory. There was a time a few months ago when you seemed overwhelmed by the stresses and the pressures of this job. But lately you've really stepped up. And I'm gonna be demanding even more of that from you in the days to come, because... I'm not quite sure of what I'm doing right. I'm sort of... I'm just gonna need you to keep a keen eye on every single thing that comes across this desk. I appreciate your confidence, Madame President. Thank you. Let's go. Just remember, if this is a trap, you die first. Preflight is complete. I need to know. Do I need to watch my back with you on this? No, I said I'd go. You have my word. Be like a homecoming for you. The other Eights talk about you all the time. Keep him the frak away from me. Barolay, I didn't ask for volunteers. Yeah, you did, back on Galactica. I don't give a frak what they think. You've been kicking ass since day one. You say you can find Earth. I wanna be there when you do. You have 14 hours and 40 minutes. - Godspeed. - Copy that. Can you feel it? The anticipation. God's plan is about to be revealed. You better hope so for your sake. Three, two, one, jump. Multiple contacts, all quadrants. Looks like we found what's left of them. How you doing, Felix? Never better. Those frakkers won't give me any more morpha. Afraid I'll OD or something. Yeah, I know. Will you promise me something? Anything. Don't let Cottle take my leg. - You're gonna be all right. - Don't frak with me. Karl. I know every minute that we stay here means it's more likely that he's gonna have to. Please. Okay, promise me. Felix, you know damn well I won't leave until the clock runs out. All right, where's the baseship? Don't know. If it's still in one piece, dradis is too cluttered to see it. Watch yourselves. We've got ordinance popping off all over the place. Looks like he wasn't lying about a civil war. This is it. This is the place. I can hear it. The unstruck music vibrates in all of us. Few can hear it. Kara's one of the few. Got a course for us? Give me the ship. Starbuck, you have any idea where you're going? The comet. The... It's the ship. This is what I was meant to see. Incoming, right, two high! She's back. Oh, frak. Kara. No, no. Take it easy, Kara. Everybody made it okay. You'll be fine. No, don't touch it. We need to get her out of here. Get her some air. Get the frak away from me! They call you Athena now. You even wear their uniform like you're one of them. You were the first to say no. - No to what? - The entire plan. You joined the humans. You had a child. You showed us that we don't have to be slaves to our programming. We wanted the same thing, but it turned out to be a disaster. The Sixes have made one mistake after another. They have to be stopped before they get the rest of us killed. Ask. You could help us. You want me to lead a mutiny against the Sixes. It's the only way. - You guys make me sick. - Why? Because you pick your side and you stick. You don't cut and run when things get ugly. Otherwise you'll never have anything. No love, no family. No life to call your own. Now you guys can either help me or get the hell out of my way. ...'cause he will take your hand... ... guide you to the other side... When you're feeling a little better. Can't you read a chart? I'm not gonna feel better. So take your needles and your thermometers and your catheters and stick 'em where the sun doesn't shine. The undiscovered country... Hello. Oh, great. Now the President. She stuck me three times today. Be thankful she hasn't put a catheter in you. Where we will bask in the radiance of God's love.</i> All this... just to... keep me alive for a few more days. It's so pointless. No, it's not pointless. And I'm sure it isn't helping listening to Gaius Baltar... No, no, no, don't touch that! Who the frak do you think you are? Accept him into your hearts... Leave me alone! It is all about love. It's not about living a righteous life. God doesn't really care how many good deeds we've done.</i> This is the mistake that I find that so many of the pious... The Hybrid will want to see you, I know it. - Let's go then. - What are you doing? You want to give her access to the central nervous system of this ship? - I thought we had a deal. - We discussed this. - Kara's the key to our salvation. - We agreed on an alliance. You want an alliance, I see the Hybrid. Leoben claims it can help me find Earth. There's no way around it. We've tried to be patient about your model's obsession with this woman. Playing house with her on New Caprica was one thing. But this puts us all in Jeopardy. We have their Raptor and their jump drive. We don't need them. - Frakkin' toaster... - Barolay, don't. You don't have time to figure out our jump systems without our help. Not before the other Cylons get back. And if we do figure it out in time, do we just keep running? How long before we run out of fuel, food, ammunition? How long before Cavil's forces hunt us down? Like it or not, we have to work with the Colonials. That means Kara sees the Hybrid. Or you can kiss your asses good-bye. Looks as if we have no choice. But first, we do this. Okay, we can do this. We can give their ship jump capability again by slaving its drives - to our Raptor's spin sync generator. - So just do it. Their Hybrid was damaged in the attack, so we're gonna have to pull her offline and execute jumps from the Raptor. Pull the Hybrid offline? Absolutely not. It's never been done on an operational ship. It would be like blinding her. It might kill her. If we don't do this before the other Cylons come back, we're all dead anyway. Make it happen, Lt. Barolay, yank the connectors from the bus and strip the cables out of them. You got it, Lieutenant. And, Six, I'm gonna need some data cabling right away. Single mode, 1310, otherwise you'll blow our system to shreds. We started the interface. Take me to this Hybrid. Anders, you're on me. Might be better if I stay here. I know more about the Raptor's system than they do. - What the hell are you looking at? - I know you. You were on New Caprica. You were part of the resistance. You killed me. Watched me drown, kicking and thrashing like I was some kind of an insect. Be happy to put you down again. I'm okay. Barolay? Jean. Jean! You killed her. You frakkin' killed her! You want to know what it feels like to die? You're nothing! You're a frakkin' machine! Sam, put the gun down now! - Sam, stop! - What do you want me to do, Kara? You want me to forget about Barolay? You want me to forget about New Caprica? No frakkin' way! She just killed Barolay! Sam! Put the gun down. - Put it down. - Look into it. Sam. Sam, you have no idea what's at stake here. Look at me. Put it down. They killed one of us and you're just ready to let it slide? She's right. You can't let this go, Kara. If you don't want to do this, I will. Put the gun down, soldier. I need to see the Hybrid. Why, sister? I just couldn't let it go. - On New Caprica... - She was the one? I never did anything to her. We were working at the water treatment plant and she just... I know. I remember. After you downloaded, we tried to work through this. How do you work through something like that? Never forget her expression as I tried to scream. Just... Just slapped tape over my mouth - and threw me in that septic tank. - You shut your frakkin' mouth. I still see her face when I try and sleep. We were trying to help those people. I know. I know. I wish there was something I could do. Then I'm glad it's you. Gods damn it! No resurrection ship. You understand? She's just as dead as your friend. Is that enough human justice for you? Blood for blood? Madam President. I wanted to apologize for before. I have good moments and bad. And that was which? Come in here. I have something for you. - For me? - Yes, yes, come in. Come in. All right. Would you get it? It's in the first drawer. Right here. That's it, yes. This is for me? I hope it's not too gaudy. This is beautiful. Thank you. That's beautiful. A woman on Aurora makes 'em. Leslie Starus. She makes all kinds if you want to check it out. Now, I think this one will be just fine. What color are you hoping for? When it grows back in? Well... I was thinking maybe blue. Nice royal blue. Change of pace. My hair used to be... Now look at it. Feel it, feel it. It's gonna get a lot worse. Be prepared for that. Because he will take our hands and guide us to the other side of the river.</i> All these things at once and many more. Not because it wishes harm, but because it likes violent vibrations to change constantly. Then shall the maidens rejoice at the dance. Structural integrity of node seven restored. Repressurizing. The children of the one reborn shall find their own country. The intruders swarmed like flame. Like the whirlwind. Hopes soaring to slaughter all their best against our hulls. I'm here. You wanted me here, so... Replace internal control accumulators 4 through 19. They'll start going ripe on us pretty soon. Compartmentalize integrity conflicts with the obligation to provide access. FTL sync fault uncorrected. No ceremonies are necessary. For what it's worth, I voted for you in the last election. And I don't like how Baltar keeps ragging on you. - But that is not why I listen to him. - Why do you listen to him? I had an experience that made me rethink all my preconceptions. What kind of experience? It happened the night after Cottle told me that my cancer had spread to my liver and I'd never be leaving this place. I was on a ferry, crossing a river, and as we were approaching the other side, I saw all these people standing on the bank. And we got closer, and I recognized them. My parents. My sister Kathy, who died when I was 12. My husband, my girls. I was scared for a moment. You know, how is this happening? But then I felt it. This... presence... hovering all around me. Warm, loving, and... It said... "Don't be scared, Emily. "I'm with you. "Hold my hand and we'll cross over together." But a lot of people in our predicament have dreams like that, Emily. No. I was there. I felt... The cool breeze coming from the water. The spray from the bow. Maybe he's stumbled onto something. You know, he talks about the river that separates our world from the next. That there's more to this existence than we can see with our naked eye. There's a power that we can't begin to understand. Then shall the maidens rejoice at the dance. Structural integrity of node seven restored. Repressurizing. The children of the one reborn shall find their own country. End of line. Reset. Track mode monitor malfunction traced. Recharge compressors. Increase the output to 50%. Assume the relaxation length of photons... Transfers contact is inevitable, leading to information bleed. FTL sync fault stands uncorrected. - No ceremonies are necessary... - I don't understand. Centrifugal forces reacts to the rotating frame of reference. The obstinate toy soldier becomes pliant. - The city devours the land... - You can't hurry her. You have to absorb her words. Allow them to caress your associative mind. Don't expect the fate of two great races to be delivered easily. Assume the relaxation length of photons in the sample atmosphere is constant. The intruders swarmed like flame. Like the whirlwind. Hopes soaring to slaughter all their best against our hulls. All these things at once and many more. Not because it wishes harm, but because it likes violent vibrations to change constantly... Hey, we're rigged and ready. Time to pull her offline and get out of here before we miss our rendezvous. - Reset. - Any luck, Captain? Not a frakkin' thing. But you are a spark of God's fire. Core update complete. Frak it! Unplug the damn thing. Let's get the frak out of here. Threat detection matrix enabled. Dendritic response bypassed. The received dose is altered by the delayed gamma burst. Going active. Execute. The children of the one reborn shall find their own country. End of line. Stop! Athena! What the hell happened? What do you want from me? Please, I need you. Thus will it come to pass. The dying leader will know the truth of the opera house. The missing Three will give you the Five who have come from the home of the 13th. You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace. You will lead them all to their end. End of line. But this god that Baltar refers to, it is the Cylon god. You know that, don't you? If he's the one and true God, he belongs to all of us. Otherwise, he's not much of a god, is he? Exactly, he isn't much of a god. He's a fantasy. Oh, Laura. And the Lords of Kobol are real. Reigning from a metaphysical mountaintop in those silly outfits. Zeus handing out fates out of an urn like... like they were lottery tickets. "You're gonna work on a tylium ship. You're gonna be an admiral. "Your family's gonna be "evaporated in an attack on the Colonies, "but you'll survive for three more years in a moldy compartment on a freighter "till your body starts to eat itself up alive." Those are the gods that you worship? Capricious, vindictive. But they're not meant to be taken literally. They're metaphors, Emily. I don't need metaphors. I need answers. You're like my mother. She wasn't satisfied with metaphors either. She was convinced that Aphrodite herself was gonna swoop her away when she died, and she believed it. Even after the Doloxan and the radiation failed to stop her cancer. She was a teacher. She was a... She was something to behold in... At the head of a classroom. And her students... Her students loved her. They... they'd walk through fire for her. And then you see this woman who... seemed so... eternal, she... withered away, and I find myself having to change her diaper because she couldn't even... And at the moment she died, there was no gleaming fields of Elysium stretched out before her. There was this... dark... black abyss. And she was just terrified. She was so scared. I'm sorry. Laura. Laura. You were terrified. You saw only darkness. You can't possibly know what your mother experienced. You're... you're still searching. You're... Doc Cottle! Doc! - Do something! - Nurse, get me some morpha quickly. It's okay. It's all right. All we can do for her now is... try to make her comfortable. - That's all? - I'm sorry, that's it. All right. It's as if she doesn't even see us anymore. She's looking past us. I've seen that look many times, but never in the eyes of a Cylon. Athena. You were right. Forgive me. It's okay. I'm with you. She will lead us to the end. We will now know the truth of the opera house. The home of the 13th. What? The hybrid said, "the missing Three will give you the Five "who have come from the home of the 13th." The home of the 13th tribe of humans... And the Five... is your Final Five Cylon models. And if they've come from the home of the 13th tribe, they must know the way back. They know how to get to Earth. And the missing Three is the model you boxed - for looking at the faces of the Five. - D'Anna. She can recognize 'em. Let's go. Demetrius is waiting for us. We're here. Mother. You're okay. I'm not ready. ... You no longer need to fear the unknown.</i> Because he will take your hand and guide you to the other side of the river.</i> What river am I talking about? I'm talking about the river that separates this world from the next.</i> There is more to reality than the things that we can touch, taste, or even see with our naked eyes. There is another realm. All hands to jump stations. Prepare to jump the ship. All hands to jump stations. Prepare to jump the ship.</i> Come on, come on. Sublight. Go. - Helm. - Go. - Nav. - Go. - Tactical. - Go. Jump solution checks. Nav is go. FTL. Drive's spun up 100% and stable, go. The board is green. She's gone. Or they'd be back by now. Execute jump in five... Four... Three... Dradis contact! Cylon baseship. It's right on top of us. Hold the count! Hold the count! Baseship is squawking colonial ID. I've got a comm signal, but it's really weak. Speakers! Demetrius, Athena. Demetrius, Athena.</i> Gods, it's good to hear your voice. Copy that, Helo. The baseship is ours. Mission accomplished. Then let's go home. I need to talk to you. - Certainly. Come in. - Thank you. - Can I get you some water? - Yes. You really believe that there's something in this horse manure that Baltar's peddling? I don't know. Something is happening here, and I don't really understand it, Bill. You both had the same dream, means... What? Talk to me. What's going on? Kara comes back from the dead. I let her go off chasing her vision of Earth. Well, she's overdue. Lee turns in his wings. And Helo, Athena, Gaeta. Will I ever see those kids again? Bill. Look at me. I'm right here. Right here. We're going to find it. Earth? Together. I used to think it was such a pipe dream. I used to use it as a carrot for the fleet. What made you change?
