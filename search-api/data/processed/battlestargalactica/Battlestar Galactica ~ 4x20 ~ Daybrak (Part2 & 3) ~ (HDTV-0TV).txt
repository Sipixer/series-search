A girlfriend stealer for a brother. - Nice. - Never stole his girlfriend. He's a really bad liar right here. There's been a terrible accident. Your sisters and your father were all killed. How about you, love? - Bet you charge a lot more than that? - Shut your filthy mouth. Stop being so disgusting. This is your father, Gaius. I found your father a new place to live. The last time I saw him, he seemed happy. Bill, I've been having that dream again. If that's me lying there, then what am I? She took these from her own mortal remains. The blood on these dog tags is 100% proof positive match for one Kara Thrace. And you think there's some kind of meaning in these musical notes. I'm just groping mostly. Looking for patterns, trying to see what comes to me. She's a half-human, half-machine object of curiosity that holds the key to our continued existence somewhere in her genetic code. So let's get a tube in her and get her ready. Based on the coordinates we got from Sam, we have determined that the Cylon colony is located here. The colony's bound within the gravity well of the black hole, but maintains a stable orbit. This right here is our only parking spot. Point blank range. Leave only one way in and out, then make it impossible to get past the gates. Let's get to work. Can I have your attention, please? I'm going to be asking for volunteers in the rescue of the child Hera. There is a line running down this deck. Volunteers, move to the starboard side. Everyone else, to the port. 40? I never paid more than 30 on Picon! This ain't Picon. Right, you got me there. "This ain't Picon." All right. 40. Show him a good time! I don't want a lap dance, okay? Try it! You'll like it! Keep the 40. He deserves it. Thank you. - Are you gonna take the job or not? - Maybe I should just do it. I'm letting my pride get in the way. Now you're talkin'. I mean, who cares? It's one hour of your time, and then you have a whole new life! A life without midnight watches, or drills, or fleet politics, or the inspections, or any of that crap. Life! You could be here every night! He won't be here every night. Can hardly get him here once. To retirement? What do you say? To retirement. If you don't participate in politics, then you are giving up your voice. You're giving up your right to have a say in the way that our society is run. - What? - You've really bought into that crap? I do. Proudly. - And so do you, by the way. - Really? That's what the uniform stands for. It's what we train to defend. - Oh, you didn't. - It's true! That's sad. That's sad. It's cute, but it's sad. Lemme guess. He's going on about voting and it's importance to a democratic way of life again. So, you were listening. You didn't tell me that your brother was an idealistic dreamer. - Dreamer. - It's sad. Truth is, he's not. Beneath that romantic exterior lies the heart of a true cynic. - Things are looking up. - This is gonna be fascinating. Yeah, it's one of the many, many, many reasons that him and dad aren't on speaking terms anymore. - Come on. - Family angst syndrome, I love it. Come on, boys. - Let's open up some old wounds. - No, let's not. Dad believes in the system. Believes in the uniform. Believes in something greater than himself. Correction, dad believes in himself. His uniform, his system, his way of life. And if you're not with him in that tiny, little bubble, - then you might as well not exist. - If you hate him so much, why'd you follow in his footsteps? Touch√©. Service gave me four years of college. I gave the service four years in return. - Simple as that. - See? A cynic. Right through to that big, empty space that used to hold his heart. Honey, I think I'm starting to like your brother. You must be Sean. Yeah, I must be. I hope so. - I'll take these. They're beautiful. - You're welcome. Do you like white wine? I do. Kinda awkward? - Blind date and all? - No, it's not, really. It's just that I have this feeling. - That I know you. - Oh? Really? There you go, Sean. - Thank you. - Welcome. Wait a minute. You were one of my students. Yeah, guilty as charged. I mean, as soon as Marcie mentioned your name I knew, but I didn't wanna tell her. - You knew I was old enough to be... - My teacher? Yeah. But I graduated. Some time ago. - Should I go? - Did I say you should go? I didn't say that. The night's young. Apparently so are you. Let's see what happens. Sean Allison. You wouldn't do it. For that kind of money? You're Gods damn right I would. No, you wouldn't. Look me in the eye and tell me that you'd do it. That you'd do it for a civilian desk job. I wanna hear it come outta your mouth. Say it! I frakkin' knew it. Come on, soldier. I love you guys. Because you guys are my family. My Gods. My Gods. Come on. - I love you, brother. - Come on, big boy. - Legs. - All right. In you go. - You want out? - Yes, please. Thank you. - He never could hold his liquor. - Unlike his brother. I'm still standing. Which means... It's time for shots. There's no need to torture yourself, Gaius. Just trust in God's plan for you. What is God's plan for me? Well, you're following it right now. Am I? By taking charge of mankind's remnants, and guiding them to their end. End of what? Gaius. - We're ready to go. - Five seconds, Paulla. I'm just... I'm leaving Ishay enough for two more rounds of injections. That should keep you on your feet for another 48 hours. Two days. Okay. That's... Should be enough. You're using up the last little bit of life you got. You realize that? Yes. You've made that clear to me several times. Right. That's it. - We're done. - Thank you. And... Thank you, Doctor. I'm just doing my job. No. You've done much more than that. You've taken a... patient who should've died years ago, and you've... given her a chance despite cancer, and the Cylons, and her own obstinate nature. And you've... You've given me the little time I have left, and for that you... You have my... my heartfelt gratitude and my thanks. Well, I... I don't know what to say. Don't. Don't spoil your image, just light a cigarette and go and grumble. It's your patient now, Ishay. Ishay, I... - I can barely see straight. - I'm not surprised. You're so pumped full of drugs you could float off this bed. Okay. Two days? All right, two days. The plan's just starting to take shape, but one thing's clear. Raptors get the toughest job, as usual. This will require some special piloting skills, and I mean special. Threading a needle while you're on a rollercoaster special. It seems a little redundant, the word's come down that it's a volunteer assignment so... That's my Raptor wranglers. Always looking for new and interesting ways to get killed. I'm not gonna lie to you, boys, we are thin on intel on this one. The Cylons believe that the most logical place for Cavil to have taken the girl is deep into the interior of the Colony. Best guess. Right here. We'll be in too close for nukes. Same thing goes for missiles. Now this gonna be strictly a gun battle. Like two old ships on the line, slugging it out at point-blank range. I want the gun captains to do their job and start firing immediately. And to continue to fire until they run outta ammo. Then... I want them to start throwing rocks. They're gonna have every gun trained directly on us as soon as we jump in. If we have any shot at this, we're gonna have to interrupt their fire control systems. And just how the hell is Sam supposed to help with that? If we can plug him into Galactica's dradis, FTL, and C-3 systems, his mind should then be able to directly communicate with the colony's hybrids once we jump in. Theoretically, his mind should still be able to control their commands and slow down their response time. Okay. - Let's do it, I guess. - There's a catch. Routing hardware connections from all systems into this room is gonna take weeks. It's a lot easier, faster, if we move him to the existing lines. - Okay, where's that? - Well, best place is the CIC. I need someone to lead this fleet who I trust, and demands universal respect. So the baseship and the fleet are yours. Thank you, sir. I won't let you down. I know you won't. I'll see you at the rendezvous. If we're not there in 12 hours, we won't be comin'. Yes, sir. Good hunting, sir. Thank you, Admiral Hoshi. Still not too late to flush them all out the airlock. Take too much time. I suppose this is what you could call poetic justice. Or what goes around comes around. Either way, congratulations, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. Adama. And the best of luck. Admiral Hoshi, sir. Sir. - The "sir" is... - Right. Good luck. You too, sir. President of the colonies, Admiral of the fleet, departing. All right, last Raptor out, people! Last Raptor out! Anyone left behind, your ass belongs to us! Great. Can we tuck this in there? Listen, I'm not coming with you. - No, please. - I made up my mind. - Our people need you. - I don't belong to you, Paulla. I never belonged to you. You appropriated me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I led you to believe... They're all yours, Paulla, enjoy them. Pilot, you have your passengers. - Gaius, don't do this. - Maybe I'll see you in the next life. Doctor. Galactica, baseship actual. The flag's been transferred to the baseship,</i> our vipers are ready to take over CAP duties for the fleet.</i> Roger that, baseship, you have the CAP. - Safe journey. - Godspeed, Galactica. Let's go around the horn. This is the XO. All combat stations prepare to report. - FTL. - Go. We'll set up triage here. Just prep the table the way that I do. Weapons. Go. Separate out the wounded. Those we can save, and those we can't. - <i>Engineering. - Go.</i> How will I know? Take this marker. Put an X on the forehead of those who are too badly hurt. You'll know when you see them. Main battery. Go. - <i>Engine room. - Go.</i> We're next. Sick bay. Sick bay's a go. - <i>Viper wing.</i> - Go. Assault one. Assault two. Reserve force. Com 1. - Sorry. - Caprica. Com 2. What're you doing here? What... I don't think you should be here. Probably been in more battles than you've have. Fair point. Life support. Emergency system standing by. I suppose a more pertinent question is what am I doing here? What the hell was I thinking? Secure blast doors on all decks. Ellen. I think we're a go up here. All stations report, sir. Connect me just to the ship. This is the Admiral. Just so there'll be no misunderstandings later... Galactica's seen a lot of history. Gone through a lot of battles. This will be her last. She will not fail us if we do not fail her. If we succeed in our mission, Galactica will bring us home.</i> If we don't... It doesn't matter anyway. Action, stations. - Start the clock. - Start the clock. Jump on my mark. Five, four, three, two, one, mark. We can't take much of this. It's time, Sam. Look through the eye just with thyself. The Colony hybrids are offline. They'll be launching raiders any minute. Launch all wings. Birds are away. All ahead, flank speed! Three, two, one, hit it! All hands brace for impact. Assault one, stand by. Here they come, let's take 'em! Light it up. Assault team on me. Let's do this. Go. Get out there. Pressure. - We've got pressure, sir. - One atmosphere. Assault one, we got pressure. Alpha team, helmets off. Move out. Think we lost Cartwheel. - Dradis is almost useless out here. - I hope that works both ways. Any sign they spotted our approach? I haven't looked at the instruments. I don't think you want me to start now. Maybe not. Let's go weapons hot, Skulls. We're gettin' close. - Sure about that? - No. But I don't wanna come outta this crap with cold weapons, either. Nukes are hot. You know, this reminds me of that time back during landing qual. Battery three, redirect your fire! Ten degrees starboard! Concentrate on taking out the Cylon batteries! Hotdog, Ladykiller, concentrate on taking out Cylon raiders</i> coming in at 084 carom 229. Tally, Galactica. We got 'em. We have a hard seal. Go. You're gonna just keep doing the tests. Even with the Colony coming down around your ears? I think you overestimate their chances. They may have confused our hybrids temporarily, but we have superior fire power and superior numbers. And in the end it's all about mathematics. Listen to me. You're pushing too much energy through the ACS. You gotta back off. You're gonna blow the main bus. You hear me? Sam! There are secrets within the eyes, answers within riddles. Lay off the ACS? You betcha, Galen. Hear what your heart wants to deny. End of line. You never should've trusted her. Trust didn't enter into it. I simply miscalculated her need to engage in gestures of futility. We have to assume that she'll try to make contact with the colonial forces aboard the Colony. - It's time to go on the offensive. - We must be cautious. Too much force could risk killing the child. Really? Ya think? Please continue stating the perfectly obvious. It fills me with confidence. I'm proud of you. What? For doing this. For being here when you coulda just walked away. I don't think I ever said it before, but... I always wanted to be proud of you. Guess I always felt that was the only thing missing. All the pieces are falling into place. You will hold the future of Cylons and humans in your hands. I will? You see them? Reconnect me! Cylons just blew a hole into deck 21! Frakkin' Centurions'll be pouring in at platoon strength! On me, let's move! Wait. Tell the Old Man... I owed him one. Doesn't change anything you did, though. We all make our choices. Today I made a choice. I think it's my last one. It's really touching. Can we get the hell outta here? You should know your Raptor's been destroyed. You can't go back that way. - Well, that's not the plan. - Can we not tell her the plan? Right. Missed the trap seven times in two days. It's a new galactic record. Regs say that you've washed out, rook. - Time to look for a new career. - What do you want me to do, sir? Do you want me to beg for my billet? Do you want me to crawl? I want you to land your frakkin' bird without diggin' holes into my deck. How's that? How about being a pilot? An officer worthy of the uniform. Take your job seriously. Don't let your personal life get in the way. I've read your jacket. Your whole story. I know that your family's gone, and I know that you have no home. All you got is the service. And it's slowly slippin' away. All because... you're wrapped up in survivor's guilt. You're trying to find a way to wash yourself out. The Doctor's in. Check your neuroses at the door. Lotta people have died on this ship. There's a lotta ghosts running around here. You don't wanna pull them into your cockpit with you. Because you won't come back alive. Do you understand that? Yes, sir. I don't think you do, but... maybe someday you will. As for now... make the trap tomorrow, rook. Dismissed. Thank you, sir. I owe you one. A lot of other people owe me one, but you know what, very few people ever pay back. Especially the ones that owe you their lives. I'll pay you back one day, sir. When it really means something. You do that. Okay, get this guy cross-checked and set me up a large-bore IV. I need a set of wipers on this marine, and a CT scan over here on this one. And get him the frak out of here! It's all right. You've gonna be all right. He's gone. All right, you'll be... You're gonna be all right. - What took you so long? - Stopped for coffee. How many other Raptor teams made it? Haven't seen anybody else. Okay, back the way we came. Guns. Point. Yes, sir. We're retracing our steps. Say again, Apollo! I cannot copy your last transmission! This is the XO. Red stripes to repel boarders. Deck 21, portside, frame 10. We got the prize! Repeat, we have the prize!</i> Formed up with assault 2 and are heading back to base.</i> Roger that! ETA five minutes. Actual out. Fire! We got a fire up here! - Connect me to command unit! - Yes, sir! Move reserved forces to guard airlock. Assault force is en route. ETA five minutes. I repeat, ETA five minutes. We're friendly! Hold your fire! Friendlies! Rangel, Peters, form up! - Sorry 'bout that. - Doc, you did good. - Thank you. - We'll take Hera. Right. - Come on. - Come on, bring Hera. Get him outta here. Fall back, fall back! What? Hera. Clear! Oh, God! Check this out. Keep that *** back here! Hang on. - Hera! - Hera, come back here! - Hera! - Look at me! - Go. - No, you'll bleed out. Go! Go! I'm empty. Two rounds. I've been here before. Yes. - We're... we're supposed to... - Go into the opera house. - This one's still alive! - Get him the hell outta here! They got the girl. They've got the little girl! This makes it a lot easier. I just take the little girl and I'm outta here. Not a chance. Cavil, we won't let you take Hera. You know that. I know nothing of the kind. I know I'm gonna watch you chase your tails across the universe - for another four years. - That's not gonna happen. This thing is the key to my people's survival and I'm not leaving without it. Hera's not a thing. She's a child. And she holds the key to humanity's survival as well. And how do you know that? I see angels. Angels in this very room. Now I may be mad. But that doesn't mean that I'm not right. Because there's another force at work here. There always has been. It's undeniable. We've all experienced it. Everyone in this room has witnessed events that they can't fathom, let alone explain away by rational means. Puzzles deciphered in prophecy. Dreams given to a chosen few. Our loved ones dead. Risen. Whether we wanna call that "God" or "Gods", or some sublime inspiration or a divine force that we can't know or understand, it doesn't matter... It doesn't matter. It's here. It exists. And our two destinies are entwined in its force. If that were true... and that's a big "if"... how do I know this force has our best interests in mind? How do you know that God is on your side, Doctor? I don't. God's not on any one side. God's a force of nature... beyond good and evil. Good and evil, we created those. And we'll break the cycle. Break the cycle of birth, death, rebirth, destruction, escape, death. Well, that's in our hands... and our hands only. Requires a leap of faith. Requires that we live in hope... not fear. If I leave you this girl, that means the destruction of my people. How does our extinction fit into this picture that you want us to believe in? We'll give you resurrection. Saul! You give us Hera and we will give you resurrection. But the war ends here. You leave humanity in peace... and give up the pursuit now and for all time. Agreed. How do we know we can take your word for it? You don't. You have to make a leap of faith. It's your call, Bill. I'll back you either way. I'm losing a lot of men out there. I can do something about that right now. - Give me that phone. - Patch him through. Hello, it's me, Cavil. Stand down! All forces cease fire immediately. Galactica, Hotdog. They're pulling back. Repeat. They're pulling back!</i> Everyone... stand down. I'm as good as my word. Admiral... Viper wing's aboard. We lost four birds. Assault force is aboard. We've lost seven Raptors. What are they doing? Each of them knows part of the secret to resurrection. They're gonna interact with the dataflow in the water. And... I don't know. It's a lotta complicated technical talk about sharing the information among the five of them and then transferring it over to the Colony somehow. Now, for a moment, we're going to know everything there is to know about one another. Looking forward to that. There are certain things that... That we've all done. Certain things that... people would be shocked to learn about. Hey, I don't mean to rush you, but you are keeping two civilizations waiting! Let's... let's just all agree that no matter... what we learn about each other, we're all Cylons, and we're all capable of making mistakes. You're forgiven for all your dark secrets. Let's do this. Any word? We're getting the data now. It looks right. They're downloading the resurrection designs now. - They've broken off the download. - It's a trick! Open fire! Frak! We've gotta get outta here! Starbuck, jump the ship! I don't have the rendezvous coordinates! Doesn't matter! Just jump us out of here now! Jump! Just trust yourself. There must be some kind of way out of here. I thought that if I assign numbers to the notes... If that's me lying there, then what am I? When I look at you now, I don't see Kara Thrace. I see... an angel blazing with the light of God. Angel. Jump! You're tempting fate. If I have a fate, then it is set and thinking about it isn't gonna make it happen any faster. Fair enough. But flying... when you're thinking about dying and... It's a bad way of doing business. You're gonna get scared and you're gonna start second guessing yourself. I'm not scared. You said that you think about... dying every time that you get into a cockpit. Well, hello? Yeah, but it doesn't scare me. Like, that's what you don't get. What, so it's... Kara Thrace, the fearless warrior, right? No, I know... I know fear. And I get scared. Just... Just not of dying. So then what does scare you? Sorry. Being forgotten. - You all right? - I am fine. - XO? - Sir? Sitrep. Damage report. I'm okay. I'm okay, go. Sir. We're mostly here. The engines... life support... But there's red lines through her lateral structural members. She's broke her back. She'll never jump again. Wherever we are is where we're gonna stay. Where have you taken us, Kara? Glad you could join us, Admiral. Lieutenant Hoshi suits me just fine, sir. Admiral stars turned out to be a little heavy. Happiest day of my life when I saw that Raptor jump into the rendezvous point. Well, there you have it, Admiral. The most advanced civilization we could locate on this planet. I can't see them talking to each other. So either they communicate a different way or they're pre-verbal. Judging by the look of their tools, which are rudimentary to say the least, I'd suggest that we've found an early, ritualistic, tribal society. They bury their dead. I came across a grave a couple of clicks back and ran some tests. Their DNA is compatible with ours. Meaning we can breed with them. You got a one-track mind, Doc. What? Listen, I'm talking about the survival of the human race, actually. Not some get together with the natives. You also have no sense of humor. Right. Right, I'm sorry. How's that possible? Human beings naturally evolved on a planet one million light years away. - The odds against that are... - Astronomical, yeah. One might even say there was a divine hand at work. Well, whoever's responsible, we're here. And here's where we're gonna stay... With our new families. My vote is that we clear everything back to this ridge. Easy access to the water down by the river. In fact, the whole area's ripe for cultivation. We should have the preliminary lines for a city within a day or two. No. No city. Not this time. What do you propose we do? We break the cycle. We leave it all behind and start over. You're talking about a little over 38,000 people... The entire human race... With nothing but the clothes on their backs and some provisions. It's not the entire human race. - There are people already here. - Tribal. Without language even. But we can give them that. I mean, we can give them the... The best part of ourselves. But not the baggage. Not the ships, the equipment, the technology, the weapons. If there's one thing that we should've learned, it's that... you know, our brains have always outraced our hearts. Our science charges ahead. Our souls lag behind. Let's start a new. We'll land civilians at various points around the planet. Our objective will be to spread the people out as much as possible to give them the best possibility of survival. Supplies will be evenly distributed throughout the camps. And locations will be documented and given to everyone. I have to say, I'm shocked at how amenable everyone is to this notion. I would have thought there'd be general uprising at the idea of losing whatever little creature comforts we had left. Don't underestimate the desire for a clean slate, Mr. Lampkin. Have you made a decision? The Sixes, the Eights and the Twos have decided to stay. See how we can contribute to the world before we pass into God's hands. We'll give the baseship to the Centurions, let them find their own destiny. I think they've earned their freedom. And what if they evolve again on their own and decide to come back in a few hundred years and wipe us out? It's a risk. But I think setting them free may be enough to break the cycle of violence. And it's a risk worth taking. And I agree. They've earned it. Now once the civilians have been off-loaded, the fleet will leave the orbit and rendezvous with Galactica. The course of the fleet will be plotted into the nav computer ahead of time. But the actual piloting will be done by Mr. Anders. He'll guide the entire fleet directly into the sun. I love you. Good-bye... Sam. I'll see you on the other side. Is your name William Adama? Yes. Are you an officer in the Colonial fleet? Yes. Are you a Cylon? I'm sorry, Bill. We're still establishing tests for the control. I need verifiable yeses and nos. No. I'm not a Cylon. Have you ever stolen money from a cash drawer? - Have you ever stolen money... - Enough of this crap. Take this thing off me right now. No job is worth this, no matter how fat the paycheck is. I'd rather spend the rest of my career, what's left of it, on a broken down old ship than have someone sit here and question my word. Perfection. That's what it's about. It's those moments... when you can feel the perfection of creation. The beauty of physics, you know? The wonder of mathematics. The elation of action and reaction. And that is the kind of perfection that I wanna be connected to. You sure this is what you want, Galen? Yeah, I'm sure. Just tired of people. Human, Cylons, whatever. Last Raptor is gonna drop me off on this island that I found off one of the northern continents. It's cold. It's up in the highlands. There's no people. Good luck. For what it's worth, if what happened to Cally had happened to Ellen, I'd have done the same frakking thing. I thought Bill was coming. - He's taking a leak. - Oh, nice. Order me a drink, honey. Keep 'em coming. Tonight we are celebrating your retirement and all the time I'm about to get to spend with my husband. Are you good with that? All I've ever wanted was to be with you. Not just weekend liberties or two week's leave a year. I mean full-time. You and me. Together in a house, in a tent. Homeless and on the street. Just be together. Excuse me. Don't drop me! To us! They're so many. Wait! I wanna... see more detail. It's... a very beautiful world. Does it have a name? Earth. It's not Earth. Earth is a dream. One we've been chasing for a long time. We've earned it. This is Earth. Okay then. Earth. It's fine. I'm having trouble... breathing. Would you like to get a better look at them? Yes, I'd... love it. I would. - Watch. - What? - Why? What are you doing? - Watch me. - What are you doing? - Put your arm around me. Can you? Dad? I don't have much time, son. I understand. What do you hear, Starbuck? Nothing but the rain. Grab your gun and bring in the cat. You should go. You know, my very earliest memory of my father was him flying away on a big plane. And wondering when he was coming back. He's not coming back this time. No, he's not. Neither am I. Where are you going? I don't know. I just know that I'm done here. I've completed my journey and it feels good. You and I... Right here... Right now. On the table? I dare you. I double-dog dare you. - Double-dog dare? - Oh, yeah. Double-dog. All right. Something's broken. I guess I better... get going. It was nice to meet you... Lee Adama. Likewise, Kara Thrace. So what about you? What are you gonna do? Today is the first day of the rest of your life, Lee. Well... I always thought when this was all done I would... kick back. Relax. Spend the rest of my days doing the absolute minimum humanly possible. And now that you're here? I want to explore! I wanna climb the mountains. I wanna cross the oceans. I wanna... I can't believe I'm saying this. It sounds so exhausting. I must be crazy. Good-bye, Kara. You won't be forgotten. You okay? Sean, it's been a lovely evening. Really lovely. But I'm afraid we won't be doing this again. - Did I... - No. No, not you. No, you're wonderful. - Come on then... - No. You can show yourself out. I'm sorry. Hello, this is Laura Roslin. I'd like you to give a message to... Mayor Adar. Tell him that I will... be joining his campaign. Thank you. All the way to the end. No matter what. All the way to the end. So much... life. It's a rich continent. More wildlife than all the 12 Colonies put together. Just looking for a quiet little place for that cabin. Maybe a garden. I don't have much of a green thumb, so I hope that you do. Right there. I'm gonna build it right there, Laura. Lot of game on this planet. - I'm a pretty good hunter, you know? - Yeah, right. What are you laughing at? What? That buck on Caprica. Okay, come on now. That's not fair. Don't you listen to mommy. Daddy is a great hunter. No, mommy's gonna teach you how to hunt. Real hunting. And I'm gonna teach you how to build a house and how to plant crops. Okay, maybe mommy will teach you that, but daddy's gonna teach you how to hunt. Hera... will she be all right? She survived. - Thanks to you. - Both of you. And that's it? That's all God wants of us? God's plan is never complete. - Great. - But I think it's safe to say... that from now on your lives will be less... eventful. I've been thinking. I may be able to help you out after all. About that thing you were asking about before. Getting a peek into the defense mainframe. - It would mean a lot to my employers. - I'm not doing it for employers. I'm doing it for you. How would it make you feel? I'd be very grateful. We'll put that to the test. Because if anyone finds out, I could get my head cut off. So I'll count on your discretion. The things men do for love. Love? Yeah, well. You know... You know what I mean, don't you? Over there between those two peaks. I saw some terrain that looked good for cultivation. Cultivation? Yes.

When the sun comes from behind those mountains... It's almost heavenly. It reminds me of you. "At a scientific conference this week at the Smithsonian in Washington, "the startling announcement was made that archeologists believe "they have found fossilized remains of a young woman "who may actually be Mitochondrial Eve. "Mitochondrial Eve is the name scientists have given "to the most recent common ancestor for human beings now living on Earth. "She lived in what is now Tanzania, "over 150,000 years ago." Along with her Cylon mother. And human father. Commercialism, decadence, technology run amok. - Remind you of anything? - Take your pick. Kobol, Earth... The real Earth before this one. Caprica before the fall. - All of this has happened before... - But the question remains. Does all of this have to happen again? This time, I bet no. Never known you to play the optimist. Why the change of heart? Mathematics, law of averages. Let a complex system repeat itself long enough, eventually something surprising might occur. That too is in God's plan. You know it doesn't like that name. Silly me. Silly, silly me.
