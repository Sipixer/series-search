we start over. You're gonna hold me in your arms, tell me you love me. l don't belong here! Let me out! Where are you getting this? Who's your source? (Chief) No idea. The source won't tell me their name. It's probably safer for all of us. - Mr President? - <i>(Number Six)</i> Morning. A Colonial transmission. The recognition codes match. We got a link to the ground. - We've got a signal. - What? (Chief) "Have hope. We're coming for you." (Racetrack) Colonel Tigh has formed an insurgent group against the Cylons. They're waiting for instructions to coordinate the rescue. It's gonna be OK. - <i>(Tigh)</i> What's our next target? - <i>(Chief)</i> l got these. Security plans for the graduation ceremony of the New Caprica Police. Our best guess puts the total police force at around 200. l wouldn't have believed 20 would turn against their own kind. l don't like this one. l think we're crossing the line here. He's a soldier. Not the first time we've sent a soldier on a one-way mission. Send a message. Work with the Cylons, you're a target. No boundaries for the Cylons, there's no boundaries for us. We round up the leaders of the insurgency and we execute them. Send a message that the gloves are coming off. (door opens) Everyone of importance is being looked at right now. You're no exception. l can help you, Laura... in ways l can't help myself. l can protect you, but you have to understand the situation has changed. The insurgency has crossed the line. Suicide bombings. It's abhorrent. It's contrary to everything that we believe in. So you... you and I, we will... we will publicly condemn these tactics. They cannot be legitimised in any shape or form. Something scares the Cylons after all. Using men and women as human bombs should scare us all. Desperate people take desperate measures. All right, look me in the eye. Look me in the eye and tell me that you approve of sending young men and women into crowded places with explosives strapped to their chests. l'm waiting for you to look me in the eye and tell me that you approve! 33 people killed and their only crime was putting on a police uniform, trying to bring some order to the chaos out there. By arresting innocent people in the dead of night. Detaining them without charge. - Torturing them for information! - Wait a minute. Nobody's been tortured. - Tell that to Colonel Tigh. - Nobody has been tortured. We're done here. l hope you understand the severity of the situation. l'd ask you to obey the dictates of your conscience, - which is what l've always done. - Of that l have no doubt. Please give this lovely lady her shoes back, then get her out of here. (PA) Curfew is in effect. Severe penalties will be imposed on anyone found on the streets. Curfew is in effect. Severe penalties will be imposed on anyone found on the streets. (whispering) Do you understand your orders? Everything clear? - Yes, sir. - Good. Don't worry. We have your back. Did you hear? The Cylons cut food rations today. We heard. How long before the next Raptor transmission? Two minutes. You know, they're taking about shutting down the marketplace. It's a security risk. We'll shift targets. You were gonna hit the marketplace? The market? Full of civilians. This is crazy. You know, we need to figure out whose side we're on. Which side are we on? We're on the side of the demons, Chief. We're evil men in the gardens of paradise sent by the forces of death to spread devastation and destruction wherever we go. l'm surprised you didn't know that. (Chief) Contact. Ready for the sitrep. Send it twice, just to make sure. (Cavil) Here are the names of those to be arrested and sent to detention. I, uh... - l know some of these people. - l'm sure you do. They're all insurgents, Jammer. We have to break the cycle of violence. OK, suit up. You won't have to wear those much longer. People will see you as heroes. (breathes heavily) Not tonight. Numbers five through ten, take the tents to the right. Follow down to the end. The rest of you guys gotta keep quiet, OK? (man) New Caprica Police! You're under arrest for colluding with the insurgency. - You're under arrest. - This is an NCP raid! Get your hands up! - Ms Cally Tyrol. - No! No! My baby! No! That's my baby! No! (cries) Hey. Oh, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. l got you. l got you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, there you go. Mommy's coming back. It's OK. It's OK. Their numbers are a little thin. It says here Tigh commands 1,150 armed effectives. That's a lot less than he should have if you count all enlisted available there. Could be taking heavy losses. They mentioned a crackdown. Get a breakdown of available pilots in the insurgent group. Somebody's gotta fly those ships. Those ships aren't going anywhere yet. "Cylons have removed launch keys from Colonial ships." "Location unknown." Came from Tyrol. - Can we manufacture new launch keys? - <i>(Apollo)</i> Forget it. The specs are incredibly sophisticated. It would take weeks just to do the R & D. Best option is for the people on the ground to find the original launch keys. - Assuming they weren't destroyed. - No. No way. Cylons would keep them safe in case they needed to use one of those ships. She's right. Keys gotta still be there. Make a weapons drop to the insurgents. They know the land. They've been hitting the Cylons in the teeth. Given the tools, they can find the keys. No way. The only thing you've got going for you so far is the Cylons reduced their defence perimeter to five baseships. Put heavy weaponry down there, they'll know we're in contact. Call in ten more baseships and your whole plan's frakked. - Funny. l thought this was <i>our</i> plan, sir. - Moving on. The military plans you have in your hands are to be with you at all times. Why'd they pick her up? She hasn't done anything. We've got a baby, for gods' sakes. - l don't know. l'll try to find out. - How long are they gonna hold her? Detention is run by a separate ministry. They don't give us any reasons why... Godsdammit, Felix! She hasn't done anything. We've got a baby. l know, Galen. - l'm sorry. - How do you do it? How do you help them day after day? How do you look yourself in the mirror? l gotta get my son. Cameron's watching him, but she's got problems of her own. Chief! l'll see what l can do. l'll see if there's something l can find out. Why don't you try and do <i>something?</i> Hey, you OK? Jammer, what's going on? l heard about last night. About Cally being on one of those lists. l'm really sorry. Frakking human police, huh? Bunch of traitors if you ask me. Some of those guys who joined up, l bet they're in over their heads, you know? Especially now with these suicide bombings... At first, l bet they thought they were doing something good. Let us police our own. They're just frakking idiots. What did they expect? You don't know any of those guys? Any names? Names? No. N-No idea. Damn. What's up with Cally? Why did they put her in detention? l don't know. She hasn't done a thing. l just talked to Gaeta. Says he doesn't know squat, or so he says. - Gaeta's a good guy. - He's a frakking collaborator. You know what? When this is all over, guys like Gaeta are gonna get strung up. Guys like you and me, we're gonna be there tying the knots. Making 'em tight. It's been a couple of ugly days. l know you don't care about that, but life means something to us, so... l've decided to show you just how precious life can be, how even in the worst of times, it can restore your faith. Remember that breeding farm on Caprica? l remember l blew the frak out of the place. It wasn't a total loss. We were able to salvage certain things. Certain medical samples. Like your ovary. What's that? This... is Kacey. Kacey, this is Kara. Your mother. Hi. Good girl. (Dualla) Unbelievable. - What? - Admiral's putting boots on the ground. Wants to send an officer as a liaison between us and the Resistance to coordinate the rescue op. - Makes sense. What's the problem? - It's who he's sending. - He's frakking kidding with this, right? - l wish he were. Hoshi, l want a Raptor ready in five minutes on the hangar deck. - Inform the flagship l'm coming aboard. - <i>(Hoshi)</i> Aye, sir. - What are you gonna do? - What l should've done a long time ago. - You can't do this. She's a Cylon. - Well, l trust her. - That's a mistake. - Well, it'll be my mistake, won't it? You're gambling with the lives of everyone on this ship, everyone on my ship. l don't need a lecture from you about the responsibilities of command. We're done here. l'm not finished. This entire plan is a reckless gamble. You have the right to risk the lives of the men and women under your command. But you are risking the lives of the entire human race. - l'm trying to save the human race. - No. That's what you're not seeing. The human race? That's the 2,000 people huddled in those civilian ships that got away when the Cylons came back. They're the safe bet. We should guard their survival like after the attack on the Colonies. - Sharon can penetrate Cylon defences. - It's not about her. The Centurions can't distinguish her from other humanoid models. Did you know that? They were programmed that way. The Cylons didn't want them becoming self-aware and suddenly resisting orders. They didn't want a robotic rebellion on their hands. You can appreciate the irony. - Dad! - l know what you're saying. But we have a responsibility to the people that we left behind. Remember what Roslin said. Our first responsibility is to the survival of humanity. We can't lose sight of that. Over the last year, we've... Iost sight of almost everything. We got... soft. But if we go back to New Caprica now, and we lose, it's over. Humanity just stops. And an admiral's stars don't give you the right to make that gamble. You're right, son. Make plans to resume the search for Earth with <i>Pegasus</i> and the civilian fleet. - With <i>Pegasus?</i> What about <i>Galactica?</i> - l know why we left those people behind. l know that it was their choice in the first place to be down there. And l realise that the survival of the human race outweighs anything else. But this time... l can't live with it. l can't face it. Maybe l'm a coward. But l'm going back. - Dad, you won't have a chance. - l'm going back, son. Once l fertilised your egg, we transferred it to a woman who carried it to term. She was pretty, funny. Great smile. You would've liked her. Although her mother died during childbirth, Kacey's heart never failed. l guess she gets that will to live from you. l've seen her path. It's difficult, but rewarding. She'll know the mind of God in this lifetime. She'll see patterns that others do not see. She probably got spiritual clarity from me. She'll be hungry soon. There's food on the table. - You wouldn't let your own child starve? - It's not my child. - l don't even know if it's human. - Half-human. You know she's yours. You just won't admit it. Where the frak are you going? Take this with you. Hey! Don't leave me alone with this. - <i>(door closes)</i> - Frak. l don't know who or what you are, but l do know this. l'm not your mother. l don't care that it's effective. l don't care that the Cylons can't stop it. It's wrong. No more suicide bombings, Colonel. You understand? What, are you working for the Cylons now? l'm sorry. There's no excuse for that. You see, little things like that, they don't matter any more. In fact, not too frakking much really matters any more. l've got one job here, lady, and one job only. To disrupt the Cylons. Make them worry about the ant hill they've stirred up here so they're distracted and out of position when the old man shows up in orbit. The bombings, they got the Cylons' attention. They really got their attention, and l am not giving that up. (Roslin) We are talking about people blowing themselves up. You know, sometimes l think that you've got ice water in those veins and other times l think you're just a naive little schoolteacher. l've sent men on suicide missions in two wars now, and let me tell you something. It don't make a difference whether they're riding in a Viper or walking out onto a parade ground - in the end they're just as dead. So take your piety and your moralising and your high-minded principles and stick 'em someplace safe until you're off this rock and you're sitting in your nice cushy chair on <i>Colonial One</i> again. l've got a war to fight. Let's go. Move it. - This way. Off-Ioad the rest. - Let's go to isolation. (Sharon) The detentions are just causing more resentment and more enemies. l know. We don't have another option. We have to show suicide bombings won't be tolerated. Excuse me, sir. Can l talk to you for a moment? Yeah, sure, Jammer. l'll catch up with you. Sir, l don't know exactly how to broach this. Nor do l know exactly what l expect you to do about it. But, um, l thought, you know, since we were... - Since we were back on <i>Galactica...</i> - Yeah, Jammer, just spit it out. We picked up Chief Tyrol's wife in the last raid. Cally. She's in detention. l think she's on a list. Frak! - <i>(Kacey screams)</i> - <i>(thump)</i> Kacey? (door opens) (Leoben) Kara. Hi, Cally. It's me - Boomer. l wish l had a gun. (sighs) Are you all right? Physically, l mean. What do you want from me? Look, a lot's happened... in everyone's life. But l want you to know... l want you and Galen to know that l'm happy for you. Especially since you started a family. Something him and l talked about once before. Can you get me out of here? l don't know. l have nothing to do with internal security. It's... Then frak you, Sharon, you stupid frakked-up toaster! How many times do l have to shoot you? If you can't help me, then just go away and leave us alone! (PA) All human personnel prepare to present ID before passing through security scanner. Have your IDs out. Keep coming. Everyone, have your work IDs ready. Step on up. Work IDs out. Straight ahead, move it. Hey, you! Open your bag. Open your bag. Stop her! 23 Cylons critically wounded. 14 had to be euthanised. They had casualties, too. Four human dead. Who gives a frak about that? Pardon my language. The power substation was crippled. Half the city's without power. Estimates put repairs at two weeks. Still think we're being too hard on the humans? We have a very serious, very straightforward problem. Either we increase control or we lose control. That's a fact. We think it's time for stronger measures. We agree. We agree. We agree as well. How about you? - We agree also. - Most of us do, anyway. Enough. What's this? This orders the executions of all the detainees on the next page. - It requires your signature. - My signature? You're the president. Read it later. Sign now. Just cos you've decided to do this doesn't mean you need to drag him into sin. Don't you lecture me about sin. l didn't commit the first act of Cylon-on-Cylon violence in history. - What's she talking about? - She crushed my head in with a rock. - Interesting she didn't tell you. - l had to do it. l'm not proud of it. This is all very interesting. Very edifying. Sign the order. - You don't need my signature. - <i>(Number Three)</i> We do. We're here as allies of the government of the Colonies. Everything we do requires your signature. They're worried what "God" might think if they commit murder. They're covering their existential asses. l won't do it. All right? l won't do it. You'll have to salve your consciences some other way. - Then we'll find another president. - <i>(cocks gun)</i> Stop this! This is crazy! - Dear God. - She'll be back. But if he pulls that trigger now, you won't. Sign it! Sign it! Sign your name! Sign it! Sign it! (Number Six) There's nothing you can do, Gaius. But it'll be OK. It's you. Help me. You have to sign it. They'll kill you if you don't. Sign it! Sign it! Sign it! Sign your name! - Sign it! - l can't. l won't. You can't force... Sometimes you have to do things you hate so you survive to fight another day. (Adama) Raise your right hand and repeat after me. - "I, Sharon Agathon..." - I, Sharon Agathon... - <i>"...do</i> pledge my faith and my loyalty..." - <i>...do</i> pledge my faith and my loyalty... "...to the protection of the Twelve Colonies..." ...to the protection of the Twelve Colonies... "...and will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors..." ...and will carry out the lawful orders of my superiors... - <i>"...as</i> an officer..." - <i>...as</i> an officer... - <i>"...in</i> the Colonial fleet." - <i>...in</i> the Colonial fleet. Congratulations, Lieutenant. l never thought l'd live to see the day. Me neither. Looks good on you. Belongs on you. This uniform... It means a lot to me, Sharon. l know it does, Helo. It means a lot to me, too. l won't betray it. Bird checks out, Lieutenant. Thanks. Can l ask you a question? How do you know? l mean, how do you really know that you can trust me? l don't. That's what trust is. Good on you, Lieutenant. Whew! That was really <i>something. (laughs)</i> l thought you might like that. But you... you didn't do the twist this time. What's that deal you did right at the end? What do you call that? You mean the swirl. Oh, the <i>swirl. (laughs)</i> Boy, that's really something. Well, you said you wanted something memorable. Hm. How is Saul? Fine. When's his next meeting with the insurgents? No point denying it, Ellen. We know he's their leader. Why do you think we let him out of detention? l thought it was because of the twist. Well, yes, that too, for sure. But having him active with the Resistance presents us with certain advantages. - l don't know anything about... - Let's just consider your denials as read. Shall we? l want a specific place, l want a specific time, for a very high-level meeting of the insurgency leadership. And if l don't get it, we pick up Saul again, and this time he'll lose more than an eye. Tomorrow, the <i>Galactica</i> is going to send two Raptors, several marines, Tomorrow, the <i>Galactica</i> is going to send two Raptors, several marines, and a ground liaison officer will brief us on the rescue mission - and coordinate our evac plans. - l'll be damned. It's really happening. Who's the liaison officer? - Sharon. - l hope that's your idea of a joke. Admiral Adama has given her a uniform and a billet. She is a serving officer, which is more than you can say about us, technically speaking. The old man's lost his mind, all right. - Where's the rendezvous? - Uh, they left that up to us. OK, here's my suggestion. If they jump into Breeder's Canyon out here... (knock at door) Come. - Hi, guys. - Hey, Ellen. As l was saying, if they jump in here they won't get picked up on Cylon DRADIS. That's a long way out there. A lot of ground to cover by foot. (Anders) l realise that. l'll meet them halfway - here. There's good cover from the air. It's pretty isolated. We gotta be sure. It may be the most important meeting we're ever gonna have. Colonel, l'm sure. This is the place. The Cylons will not find them here. All right, give me the map. You got the message memorised? All the wireless freqs? All right, then give me the message, too. l'll do that, Saul. Don't get up. Thanks. (Anders) l've assembled a team. We've been out half a dozen times. We have provisions for a couple of days and access to running water. l know that place like the back of my hand. This is gonna work. Gaius? Gaius! Did you sign this? - Tell me you didn't. - Not now. This is a death warrant! Have you seen the names on this list? Do you have any idea what they're about to do? Are you listening to me? - l didn't have any choice. - What the hell's the matter with you? There are over 200 names on this list. Have you even looked? - Look at the names, Gaius! - l've seen them! l've seen them, all right? There was nothing l could do. (man) Move! Move! Move! You do triple digits. You can do that. Let me see. (woman) Laura Roslin? Come with us, please. Killing Tyrol's wife will only embitter him against us. He's head of a labour union... Let's be honest. You don't think there's any reason to kill any of them. - Right. - Well, we made a decision. All of us. Like when we listened to you and Caprica Six when we came here to start this new and glorious chapter. This has nothing to do with executing Cally. No one enjoys the thought of mortal death. But she tried to murder you. Maybe it's gods' justice. Need a lift, Mr Vice President? l guess so. l haven't seen much of you lately. Been busy? Well, not much to do in detention. How long have you been held? Four months. l told Baltar l wouldn't have any part in collaborating with the Cylons and he got a little pissed. He's a little pissed at me, too. Jump complete. Right on target. l'm dropping down to the landing point. There's some heavy turbulence up ahead. Follow the river. Make sure you hug the bank. (Sharon) OK, once we reach the rendezvous point, stay back. (Sharon) Go, Panthers! C-Bucks rule! Hey, Sam. - It's been a long time. - Funny. l feel like l see you every day. Come on. Lords, please don't take her life. It was my mistake. Don't punish her for it. It was an accident, Kara. Nothing more. Kacey? Kacey, oh, my gods. Honey. - Let them stretch their legs for a minute. - Yes, sir. Let's go! All right, everybody out. Five-minute rest break. Come on, move! Everybody out! Five-minute rest break. Come on, let's go! Come on, five minutes. Everyone out. Let's go. Tell me something, Laura. Last year? You tried to steal the election, didn't you? Yes, l did, Tom. (laughs) Oh. - l wish you'd gone through with it. - Me, too. We'll wait until nightfall before we go back. There's a system of tunnels. - Our level is under... - Shh! Did you hear that? Down! Get down! - <i>(shouting)</i> - <i>(gunfire)</i> You. Over here. Run. Run. Don't look back. Go! (gunfire) - Bingo. Let's...
