about damages you can't see. Hairline fractures in all the beams. It's throughout the entire ship. It's our baby, Saul. We'd come to believe that a lack of God's love is what prevented us from biological reproduction. And our love produced a child. - Let him go now. Take him now. - Saul, stay with the fleet. It's all starting to happen, it's the miracle right here. Stay with the fleet! Ellen, you're the Fifth. - What are you doing? - Forgiving you. - Is this gonna work? - I have no idea, sir. This is the stuff? Yeah. - Can I touch it? - Yeah. It's gooey. But it... hardens. Becomes like cartilage. It's flexible, strong. It's what the baseship's made of. Is this alive? Heads up. Heads up, marines. Stay back. Stay back and everyone will get their share! Stay back! Everyone'll get their share. Hey, Cylon. - I don't want any trouble. - Well, you got trouble. This better work. Kid's got a heart like a kettle drum. Go on, get out of here. Make room for some sick people. You should stay here for the night. I don't trust that machine. I know. The irony is irresistible. The baby's fine. Liam is fine. You know I'd sleep better at home with you. Sitrep. Sir, we're picking up a bogey on dradis. Raptor. Squawks colonial, but it's not on the roster. It's one of ours, but we logged it as lost over a year ago, sir. Galactica, permission to board. Raptor 702, your transmission's all garbled. If you can hear me, give me a flash. Copy, 702. Galactica, they're receiving. Red leader, Red Turkey, the voice. I think that's an Eight. Starbuck, Galactica actual. - <i>Report.</i> - Galactica, Red leader. Our heavy raider buddy's calling the inbound a "Sharon". An Eight. Starbuck, bring it in. Copy that. My Gods. It's Ellen Tigh. Bill. How many dead chicks are out there? I can't tell you how happy I am to see you. Aren't you gonna help a lady down off this thing? Nice to see you again. This is Boomer. Marines. Take this number Eight to the brig. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA Season 4 - Episode 16 Subtitles -=( Lords of Kobol )=- He wants to rebuild resurrection. He wants us to rebuild it. I really think Cavil's completely unbalanced. It's too much for him, the thought that the... The only hope for the Cylon people is this desperate grab for procreation, evolution, all that messy biological trial and error. Dear. I'm totally throwing you, aren't I? I'm still Ellen, you know. Does anyone have something to drink? Maybe a flask? So Boomer helped you escape. Yes. I hope you won't treat her too badly. You don't need to worry about Boomer. May I see them? The others? Galen, Tory, and Sam? Imagine, Bill, Laura, imagine... instead of... 50,000 survivors, there are only five. Five people. Imagine how close you'd be. And then to have all that torn away. It's all right, Ellen. It's over now. How much do you remember? Not much from before. Flashes. Samuel Anders was badly injured. He's not responding. - My God. - He's not dead. - There's hope. - I want to see him. I want to see him and the others. We'll see what we can do. I can't believe you're here. There is so much I have to ask you. There's so... I have to tell you. You'd better say it fast. Ellen, wait. - Floor or table? - I don't care. Gaius! Jeanne. - Welcome back. - I missed you. Let me look at you. Paulla. We were wondering if you were coming back. If? Of course I was coming back! Course I was. So. What did I miss? What's been going on? Well, it got pretty bad after you left, Gaius. They'd bring us supplies and men would come and take them away by force. It was... We were very tired, Gaius. We realized we'd been abandoned and we had to take care of ourselves. Abandoned? I... How could you... - I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say... - Abandoned by God. That I might. I might say that. There were dead men in the halls with guns in their hands. So we took their guns. Now we can protect our food and we can protect ourselves. All of this... All of this is food, Gaius. We're taking care of ourselves now. I knew if I stayed away that you'd find the strength. And you have. It's one of the reasons why I stayed away as long as I did. That was wise of you, Gaius. Sheep have a new shepherd, Gaius. That's what I call a big welcome. Very impressive. So who'd you frak? What? Come on. You don't think I know your repertoire after thousands of years of marriage? It's okay. I'm not mad. You thought I was dead. - Ellen. - Who was it? Well, if you really... It was a Six. Caprica-Six. We made Sixes. - We created her. That's just... - I thought of you. Always. - I thought of you. - What do you mean? When you... Please do not tell me I was your mental porn. That's just sad. - Well, are you still seeing her? - Yes. Lot of visitors. Just don't anybody unplug anything. Oh, my. I never thought I would see this. Yes, this is how it was. Tory. Galen. All those years. The poor boy. Such bad timing. We've been thinking. We belong together. Join us on the baseship. We'll jump away. Start a new life. Please consider the offer. It would mean so much to us. Abandon the fleet. This is your offer? The priority of the fleet is the survival... The survival of humans. We're not safe in this fleet. - Even today a Cylon was assaulted. - I agree. This is about the survival of the original 13th tribe in its purest form. Did you put this idea in their heads? It won't work, of course. The child, Hera, is the hope for a new blended future. That used to be true. But now there's another way. Caprica-Six's unborn baby is pure Cylon. We can rebuild a pure Cylon civilization. Even if we don't find a planet to colonize, we can live indefinitely on the baseship. Look at him. He'd die over there. We can take care of him better than here. The Cylon family can survive. We can start over. Caprica-Six is pregnant? - You got her pregnant? - I... I did. Yeah. I didn't know. - I was surprised. - It was a great surprise to all of us. The mating of an original Cylon. You are our children. Can we talk about the offer, maybe deal with the baby later? Are we going or...? Of course not. Anders specifically said "Do not abandon the fleet." - So you love her then. - Last thing he ever said. He's not saying anything now. I'm going with the baseship. Even after you knew... - For frak's sake. - You made us all filthy in this. You just can't stop poisoning me. Poison more and more of it until I'm swimming in it! - Stop this. - I'm staying on Galactica. You hear me? - You can go if you're so mad. - Wait. We won't leave with just one or two of the Five. It has to be all of you or none of you. So you need to vote and the outcome will bind all of you. Majority rule. It's what Cylons do. It's a legacy from you. Fine. So it's a vote? All right. I vote we go. Great. That's me and you. We don't really know what Anders would vote. Yeah, we do. He said he'd stay. All those years we tried to have children and we never could. You must've been laughing your shiny, shiny head off. It was impossible. You didn't love me. So what are you saying? Do you vote to stay or to go? I haven't decided yet. Two to go. Two to stay. And the swing vote is walking out the door. We come to Dogsville more often now. We don't feel the need to cut ourselves off from the rest of the world. We trade here. Sometimes, we sell the jewelry that we made. That's how we got so much food. Yes, Jeanne. Since you've been gone, we've been trying to focus on life. Gaius, come on. Hello. What's your name? Naia. Naia. That's a very beautiful name. And who's this? Stand up. Stand up. This is Gaius. Really? I'm very flattered... It was his father's name. To have the same name as his father. It's very... Are you hungry? You look a bit hungry. He's hungry? - They're all hungry. - Are they? Paulla, we've got some food, haven't we? To share with this lot of people? We're gonna need it eventually to eat, to trade. We can't. Really, Paulla. Are we going to enjoy this food with children starving? Now ask yourself this question really. Look aroun, look at these childr... It's not just this child here. This... Little Gaius. But he is very cute, this one. It's all the children, isn't it? All of them. And you're putting the food... Listen to me! Listen to me! I'm coming back here. And if it is the last thing I do, I will ensure that every single one of you are fed and your children are fed, as God is my witness! Caprica. That's funny. I don't think I've ever called you a name before. I think you probably called me some names. I haven't had the chan... No, I haven't taken the opportunity to congratulate you and the baby. I just wondered if everything was all right with Ellen being back. I heard about the assault in Dogsville. And on behalf of the fleet, I wanted to apologize to you. Thank you. It's very kind of you. Caprica, sometimes I think about the visions that we shared and the talk... we had. I haven't had one in a while. Have you? Not the whole time I've been pregnant. That never occurred to me. Are you saying that this ch... What? Is this child important? Yes, I think he's very important. He's my baby and I love him. He's very important to me. Of course he is. Of course, all children are important. Yes. Indeed. Thank you for asking about him. You're welcome. When'd you get a piano? Gin. You see Ellen and Tigh on the wing of that bird? It's like watching my parents make out. You go see Boomer in the brig yet? No. You should go when she's asleep. I watched Sam until I just couldn't handle the fun anymore. There you are. Look at you. You haven't changed much. How did you get the guards to bring you here? I thought maybe we could have a drink. Where's the booze? - I have tea. - God no. Listen, I wanted to talk to you. Things between me and Saul just got so crazy. I step off that Raptor and boom, we're making love. And less than a day later, I'm... I'm screaming at him. But we were always, always, always like that. Anyway, I just... I wanted to assure you. He didn't tell you about the sex. Frak. I'm... I come here to try to be good and... Look. Don't worry. Seriously. Because you have all the proof right there that he loves you. You know, when we were still trying to have our own, he always brought up the name "Liam". Pure Cylon baby. If Simon knew, he'd want it so badly. I'll take care of this child. That wasn't a threat, Caprica. No. It was a threat. I don't know why you couldn't have children, Ellen. Sometimes love must not be enough because he loved you. Yes, this... This is rough. But what can I do? If I make him choose between you and me, I know the best I could do would be to tear him in half. Don't. I won't. You win. The man loves you. In fact, I'd say there isn't much he loves more. Here you go, Gaius. Here you go. Here you go. Take that to mommy. Here you go. There you go. The marines tried this already, Gaius, and people started pushing and grabbing. The marines have assault rifles, not handguns. Look around you, Paulla, will you? Look around. Can you see anybody rioting? Can you? No. - There's no uniforms here. - Come, come. There's no sense of oppression. It's just... It's just one soul touching another, isn't it? Well, we need the food. Paulla, when you share your food, God makes it tenfold. You watch me. You're going to learn something. You're gonna want to step away from those. Really? And who will you be? Step away from the supplies. Ladies, show this man we are armed. Do it. Take it off the safety, Jeanne. Ours are bigger. Careful... So the five of you together at last. Any... mythic revelations? Nope. Nothing to report, sir. - You were born, right, Saul? - What? You were born. On Earth. Yeah. I don't remember. But... I wouldn't anyway. Nature of the process, right? Not very machine-like of you. Great grandpa was a power sander. They're puttin' the stuff into her. - The Cylon goop you said. - Yeah. If it works, she'll still be the Galactica on the outside, but... She won't know what she is anymore. It'll save her. That along with Cylons flying cap. We need their help. I need your help. Laura and Lee know it. They don't think I see it. But I do. I see it. You never told me that the Sons of Aries were involved in this. Of course they are, Gai. Did you think they would stay out of something as valuable as food supplies? Well, you didn't want to be king of the fools anymore. No, the only thing worse than being leader of this lot... would be being one of them. Did you really want to feed those people? I enjoyed it, actually. I did enjoy giving. I loved it, actually. The more I did it... Done it long enough, I'd have given them my heart. Well, do you think she's... telling them anything as moving as that? Do you think she's giving them hope? She's not, is she? What's Paulla been saying to you? Has Paulla been saying that we mustn't help others? Because... I disagree. Has Paulla been saying that we can't help others because we're too weak? I disagree. Oh, Paulla. I am so disappointed with you. I'm disappointed with all of you. Here you all are. I'm gone for three minutes and you're lapping up Paulla's icy pragmatism. There is a way to feed ourselves and the people from Dogsville! There is a way to bring hope to the lower decks. To the whole of this poor ship. There is a way to win! She thinks we can't get what we need. She thinks we can't get what we need. All we need is strength. All we need is strength! And strength comes from within. We can get more guns. Better guns. Bigger guns. And guns! More guns. Bigger guns. Better guns. And when we have those, we will win! Thanks for seeing me alone. I just... - I have to talk to you. - Of course. Hate me, i'll take it. But this is bigger than that. Galactica needs the baseship. Why did you even make love to me, Saul, when your real love was at home? Did you even hear what I said? Bill needs the baseship. I heard you. Did you hear me? Her brush is where mine used to be. My dresses are gone. She shares our bed. Do you remember, I got us that mattress. You went to my quarters. Not interrupting? Not at all. I was expecting you. You called him? Good. Come on in. You too, Caprica. What is this? We're joining the baseship. All of us. - We can jump away when you're ready. - Thank you. - It's the right decision. - No. No, it's not. No. The vote is you and Anders versus me, Tory and Galen. Caprica, obviously, that means you have to come too. Wouldn't you like to raise your child where it's safe? I want him to be safe, yes. She doesn't understand what this means. I used to think Hera was the only hope for us. But clearly that's just not true anymore. Her baby, he's pure Cylon. If we go off and make some pure Cylon culture, that's what happened on Earth and it led to disaster. Pure human doesn't work. Pure Cylon doesn't work. It's too weak. You just don't want to leave the one you really love. What? - Talk to me. What is this? - It's petty and vile. Enough. She's voted. When's the jump? We can be ready in an hour. - I'm not goin'. - We agreed on majority rule. Frak, apparently we invented majority rule. But I don't remember it, so frak that. Saul, don't let her... All right, go. Go. All of you. Caprica. Go. Go be pure and safe and whatever - the frak. I'm not goin'. - Do you see, little girl? There is something in the universe that he loves far more than you or me... And that's Bill Adama. You don't even want to go. This is all to hurt me. - Bill Adama, the ship and the uniform. - How can you sink so low? - Everything else takes second place. - Why doing this? I knew I did. But I always wondered if a baby would. Guess I know now. Something's wrong... Get Cottle. You'll be okay. Never seen anyone get into trouble so fast, but he's fighting back. That's all I can tell you. - I didn't mean this. - Yeah, you did. Here, this may help increase his heart rate. You knew how I would have to choose. You knew what it meant. I'm sorry. Of course, Cylons and humans need to stay together. But I always intended... I just... I didn't think. Saul, I only wanted to hurt you, - not her. - You didn't think I would hurt her, if I let her go. It never occurred to you? No wonder we had to invent them some compassionate god to believe in. We couldn't have them deify us, could we? - We didn't invent anything. - Shut up. Just stop! I'm so sorry. Maybe... I just shouldn't be here. First intelligent thing you've said. Talk to her. Tell her you love her. It's what she needs. It's what the baby needs. Listen. I love you, all right? Can you hear me? This is nonsense. She knows it. I don't need to say it. I shouldn't need to say it to anyone. Isn't it enough that I feel it? - Just tell her. - I feel it. For her. For you. For Liam. Shouldn't need to spout the words. I feel it less with words. Just let me Gods damn feel it and I'll fill the frakkin' room. His heart rate is dropping. I got signs of distress all over. Doesn't look good. I am so sorry. Cut him out. Even if it kills me. He'll live if you cut him out right now. Cylon babies must be strong, right? Hera was born early. Cut him out. I am not cutting you. Forget it. He'll never make it. Four months? - No. - Please. Caprica, listen, I have to tell you. He loves you more than he ever loved me. You are the mother of his son. The boy is alive. I can see his heartbeat on the monitor. And that's proof. Proof he loves you. He loves you so much. It's shining out of him. You and he can stay on Galactica. I'll go away with the others. And you can be together. A little family. I promise it. That's it. I'm sorry. No, that was me. That was me. I take it back. I'm sorry. The lady and I have some work to do. It's time for you to leave. You have to go now. Nurse! Out now. She's in good hands. The two of you can stay here and listen to this. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna go to the head. Do something constructive. A little project I've been working on. Listen to me, Admiral. Just wait. Explain what you mean. What you have right now is starving civilians with no representation, no recourse. They're broken. They're exhausted. They've had enough. That's not a mutiny, Admiral. - That is a revolution. - And you can maintain order? Listen to me. List... Please, Admiral! Galactica is slipping away from you drop by drop. You are pouring Cylon blood into her veins. I see the Cylon pilots. We all see them. We all see the Cylon workforce. Where are they going into the far recesses of the ship? When are you inviting the Centurions over to join in all the fun we're having over here? Of course, when you do that, that very moment, this becomes a blended ship. Only half human. And right now I am here to tell you, your people... Your people are not ready for that. Listen to me, Admiral. I am offering you the last human solution you will ever be presented with. Well, guys, you did it. I don't know how, but you did. I told you, Paulla. I told you. You do good deeds and you are rewarded. You're rewarded ten... Tenfold. And then if you give... Then you receive, don't you? That was beautiful. I'm sorry. Liam. His name was Liam. It's a good name. - Short for William. - Yeah. It's not like that. I know. I know it's not. I know. It's okay. It's okay. These are the Cylons that have died with us since the alliance.
