My Triumphs, My Mistakes by Gaius Baltar. The people are reading it, and now you're sorry. Baltar will get his trial. And this is what you'll get - a hurricane. You will have sectarian violence, assassination attempts. You will have civil unrest on a scale we've never seen. The president wants to fast-track Baltar's trial. She wants someone to take charge of the preliminaries, help cobble together the legal framework. She wants me to assign you. - <i>(Apollo)</i> My grandfather's law books. - <i>(Dualla)</i> It's from your father. Starbuck, Apollo. l've lost you on DRADIS. No! No! Lee. We're sending in the search and rescue birds. We'll find her. No, Dad. It's no use. Her ship's in pieces. We lost her. (Roslin) Here's every captain from every ship in the fleet. Captain Elias Meeker, <i>Gideon.</i> And the last name for the tribunal is... Ad... Gods. Yeah. Yeah, l see the resemblance. (Anders) One more for heads! Watch. Heads! You see that? Four in a row. It's a frakking miracle. Watch this one more time. It's gonna be heads. Watch. Heads! Every time! You see that? It's heads. - Why don't you come down from there? - l'm just fine right here. Major? Yeah. Heads! You see that? My girl's too lucky to check out. Hey, Sam. Lee. Apollo. You stay there, buddy. You're flying. - Let's get down and get some sleep. - l'm just... l'm fine. l need to sit down. Ow. You all right? She wasn't supposed to... - Come on. - No. l gotta go. (Apollo) Frak! Frak! Is he OK? - Oh, l think l fell. - Sam. Sam. (groans) She's still alive, right? She's gone, Sam. She's gone. - l know. - Yeah. (Hotdog) LSO, Viper six. Request long approach. (man) Viper six, LSO. Viper approved. Never thought l'd miss all of Starbuck's yakking. Yes, sir. Your Honour. You haven't heard. Where you been? They just announced it. You won the lottery. You now own exactly 1/5 of Baltar's skinny ass. You're one of five captains picked to serve on the judges' tribunal. (Adama) Hm. - <i>(Sharon)</i> Here he comes. - Frak. It's a waste of my time flying Baltar's lawyer back and forth from <i>Zephyr.</i> - Tell me about it. - Wanna know the worst part? He sits there and tries to whisper into my ear when he talks. l've got a helmet. Sorry. Mr Hughes. If he takes his shoes off in my Raptor again, l might have to kill him. "Client." Everybody knows he's guilty. He gave the Cylons our location. - Why give the son of a bitch a trial? - Because he's entitled. - Even him. It's called justice. - Yeah, right. To see Baltar dead and Starbuck alive, that'd be justice. There's no justice. As drunk as he was... Racetrack! (Cally) Racetrack! Are you OK? Yeah, yeah. l got him. l got him. OK. OK. (Skulls) You OK? How do you intend to replace Baltar's defence attorney? - Will that be done by lottery as well? - We'll replace him shortly. There's a number of candidates. We're working our way down the list. Next. In the context of this explosion, obviously no accident, do you really think it's wise to proceed with this trial? This administration will never bow to terrorism. Wait. Let me say something to all of you. Let me get this clear. All right? As long as l am president, this administration will not allow terrorism to alter the framework of our legal system. We will proceed with the trial. Rigorously. - Thank you. All of you. - One more question! Helo. l need you to set up a DRADIS picket with blue squadron at sector seven. Uh... Excuse me, sir. You mean sector nine, right? Uh... Right. Right. Nine. Um... Yeah. We scrubbed eight on the last picket. It's been so quiet, one picket just flows into the next. OK. Uh... 81 carom, 22 degrees. Keep your ears open. Any Cylon contact, just shut down, bug out. Red squadron. You'll be riding first CAP with me. And from here on, double shifts. Athena, l'm gonna need you exclusively on shuttle runs. Well, don't forget to check under your back seat. Hey. Hey. You got lucky, Starbuck. If l were you, l would seriously consider... Racetrack. l'm sorry. Dismissed. Dismissed. Well, it's so comforting to know that you're not afraid. You're not afraid to represent the most hated man alive. The question is why? For the fame, the glory. You worked in the public litigation office on Caprica. You think you have the qualifications to handle a case of this magnitude? l was born for this. That and the fact l have a pulse. Lance belonged to my wife. Don't worry. He doesn't scratch or bite like she did. If it's of any comfort, l despise him as much as you do having to hire me. So. There it is. Shall we get started? l'm gonna need you to handle the security detail on the new attorney. Me? So that's it? You're grounding me? - You're the only one l can trust. - Just say it. You're pulling me. Keeping Lampkin alive is an important job. l need your help. Dad, l'm fine. - No, you're not. - Why? Because l'm not. Yeah? Well, then, maybe you should take a rest. Helo will be stepping in as CAG. l want you on the ship, not up there. Not until you can... work this out. All right. l understand. Work it out. OK. l'll be handling security for you. Where do you want your bags? You'll have two marines outside the door. Ms Cassidy, the prosecuting attorney, she's just down the hall. Shower's that way. Sorry, co-ed. Now, if there's anything else... l'd like to see my client. Now? - Pilot. - Yeah. King of the pilots. We could stand around here and discuss why you got stuck with me if you want. - l'll take you to his cell. - No. Half the ship's probably listening in. Fine. We have an interrogation room. Interrogation rooms give me stage fright. - l can't bring him here. - l was thinking your quarters. - What? - Before it gets wired for sound. What's the problem? Forgot to make your bed? Look, l don't care where you see him. l just can't leave you alone. Major. It is Major, isn't it? l have the right to consult with my client in private, without anybody eavesdropping or looking in. Whoever cares the most... wins. Says so in there. So? l want to see my client. You don't care. l win. You know, you look like him. You knew my grandfather? Hated his guts. He taught me everything l know. (beeps) - What are you doing here, anyway? - You can speak freely. He's signed confidentiality papers. This whole charade's pathetic. Pathetic. Security? Security is already toasting my other attorney's untimely demise. About the only thing that bloke ever did apart from napping was... manage to... smuggle out my papers. Papers! Do you have any papers? Thank you. The nature... of modern life... is... obsession. So, tell me... do you honestly think that l'm gonna get a fair trial? - Doubtful. - Yes. But you haven't exactly been helping yourself, now, have you? - You object to my writing. - On the contrary. Keep it coming. This new manifesto of yours shows great change in you. This little, uh, operating manual of yours, well... it keeps them all guessing. OK. OK. Caprica Six. l'm worried about her. She's the key. They can use her to completely destroy me. l need to get to her. l need to know what she's thinking. And you need to... l mean, talk to her. Tell her... uh... Tell her l love her very much. l'm thinking about her a lot. l can sense that, yes. You need to find out where we're all standing. "To listen requires a voice, for what needs to be known requires us to ask." My Triumphs, My Mistakes by Gaius Baltar. - But you say it very well. - l've done my reading. Once those papers arrive, l suggest you do yours. Fly me to <i>Colonial One.</i> - Me? - Yeah. You're a pilot, aren't you? You can't just jump in a Raptor. It has to be coordinated. Where would you rather be, Major? Here? As the parade float for the bereaved? - What are you talking about? - People look at you like you're bleeding. You wanna to see some real blood? Keep going. Oh, there <i>is</i> someone home. Look, l need those files. You come with me, they might just give them to me. l wait, they're gonna discover that Baltar's pregnant before l get them. What is your job, anyway? To keep me alive? Or to keep me from doing mine? Sorry, sir. You know your status. You're to remain shipside. Admiral's orders. The father factor. Come on, Kelly. Give me a break. l'm along for the ride. Don't do this to me. All right? l'm in enough dung already. All right. (beeps) All right, let's give the bird a tow. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up! Open the door! What the frak was that thing? Did you see that? - What? - l think it was a cat! There's a cat in there! Come out of there, Major! - <i>(Kelly)</i> Who the hell let a cat in here? - <i>(Chief)</i> On the other side. Push him here. There it is. It's over there. There it is. There it is. Here it is. Here, kitty, kitty. No, no, no. Come on. - Come here, kitty. Come here. - <i>(beeping)</i> Bomb! Bomb! Everybody out! What the hell were you doing out there? l gave you an order to do a job. - Excuse me. l was doing my job. - Yeah. Being led around by the nose? This bastard yanks your chain and you jump. - He wanted files from <i>Colonial One.</i> - It was the middle of the night. - You assigned me to security. - Yeah. And there was a bomb on that ship and you missed it. Security. l gave you explicit orders. Athena was piloting. You could have died. Plain and simple. You're a soldier. Live like one. Start acting like one. She's been gone two weeks. l didn't know the clock was running. - Stop. - Sorry. Maybe we're just built differently. You stop. Don't you dare quantify my loss. You have no idea. You have no frakking idea. - You think yours is deeper? - Wow. Yours is greater? In two weeks, there's going to be a trial. And l'm gonna do what l was chosen to do, and so are you. You build a frakking nest around this man and you protect his ass. Frakker meant business this time. If that had gone off, we'd be picking up people parts with tweezers. Every day l wave jocks out there. A lot of them are my friends. People l care for and love. It's hard enough watching them die in battle. But rickshawing Baltar's frakking attorney around? Frak that. l believe the Cylons want us to destroy ourselves, and this is how they're doing it. They're planting bombs, making us suspicious of each other. Know what? By the time the Cylons catch up with us, they won't even have to attack. They'll just clean up the mess we made. I... l think they're here. l think you're wrong. l kissed Nicky this morning. It could have been the last time. - Cally. That's enough. - What? l kissed you, too. Some of us don't get a second chance. Or a third. l'm going to the admiral. Take a good look at this room. Every time you leave, memorise it. If anything changes, don't touch it. Uh... a book moves, shoes in the wrong place, something smells different, you get the frak out. Someone knocks, don't answer the door. Don't open the door. Look, you have to do what do l say. If they wanna kill me, they'll find a way. Now, who do l have to bribe to see the Cylon woman? "The nature of modern life is obsession." l can't find my glasses. It's like they've got feet. The Six. Yes. OK. Lampkin can interview Six immediately, if it's conducted under the conditions accorded to the chief prosecutor. Meaning in the interrogation room, not where you sleep. Of course. But since you've been selected to serve on the tribunal, l'm assuming that you won't be present at those interviews. - The major has a point, Bill. - The major is mistaken. l monitored the chief prosecutor's interview. Therefore, the same conditions apply, in the interests of fairness. Mr Lampkin is entitled to the documents he requested from <i>Colonial One.</i> Yes. Right. l apologise. We've had trouble locating the files. We'll have them delivered to you on the next run. l'm sorry, Major. We'll get them to you right away. Thank you. Thank you. (Lampkin) l understand you had a romantic relationship with my client. Gaius Baltar is a brilliant, gifted human being. In the time l've known him, he's made a sport out of mendacity and deception. He was narcissistic, self-centred, vain. l'm the one who should have stabbed him. - Things are looking up. - <i>(Lampkin) Love.</i> A precocious evolutionary move, fashioning Cylons to experience it. l don't know if it was engineered as a tactical imperative, but... - It's not for the faint-hearted, is it? - No, it's not. Maybe you should have been nicer to your mechanic. Well, perhaps Cylon love is not the same as human love. Perhaps it's designed to hurt a little less. - How would you know? - l loved a woman. Beautiful, beautiful woman. But so serious. This frowning face trapped in the middle of a daisy. She had a way of walking. Processional, as if she were on her way to her own execution. We had ten years. - Then it fell apart under its own weight. - Is that what you wanted? l thought if l could get over her, l could get over anything. l could endure, conquer, be a man. Stand up to any and all kind of punishment. l clung to an empty, spinning bed for months. And that... that is when l finally realised how much l loved her. If l needed all that strength, what was the point? l needed to be with her. Did he... ask about me? Gaius? He wanted to know if you were well. He wanted you to know that he misses you, loves you. Because he can't be here to tell you, he gave me this to give to you. He uses that, at the risk of grave reprisal, to express his feelings, to put his world into some kind of recognisable order. To be heard. He's kept it hidden because he knows he will not get another. He wants you to have it because, without you, it has no meaning. He wants you to have it because he would do anything - anything - to be with you again. Well, that's a shame, isn't it? Since they'll never let me keep it. You understand that your days are owned by these people, the ones watching us? l think you realise what's likely to become of you. l couldn't help you if they paid me ten times what they offered me for Baltar. You won't get a trial, not even a bad one. So... l have to ask you. Does your love hurt as much as mine? Yes. l feel like part of our world just fell down. - Hey, guys. - Yes, sir. Why encourage the man to write, and then take his pen? He'll curry more sympathy when we get the word out that he's been silenced. Tyranny. Gag orders. Very sexy. OK. All right. So you steal his pen, then you lie to him, then you lie to the Six. The horror of the age. The great, ugly material. The cloak of deceit. The truth. Kind of overrated, l guess. You know, when l was nine, maybe ten, my grandfather... he would wave me over. And he'd do this all the time. And then he'd say: "Lee, be a good boy." "Just don't be too good." Everybody has demons. Them, Baltar, you, me. Even the machines. The law is just a way of exorcising them. That's what your father's father taught me. Wanna know why l hated him? Because he was right. You hated him because he was right. l hated the law because it was wrong. Because of what... of what it put him through. l mean, he defended the worst of the worst. l remember reading about him. The outrage - helping murderers go free. What l don't understand is why he put himself through all that abuse. You think he gave a flying frak? Joe Adama cared about one thing - understanding why people do what they do. Why we cheat our friends. Why we reward our enemies. Why we go to war, sacrificing our lives for lost causes. Why we build machines in the hope of correcting our flaws and shortcomings. Why we forgive - defying logic and the laws of nature with one stupid little act of compassion. We're flawed. All of us. l wanted to know why. So l did what he did. l spend my life with the fallen, the corrupt, the damaged. You were ready to get on that Raptor with me, be the bad boy, the prodigal son. - l was just doing my job. Protecting you. - What are you doing in my business? Suddenly l'm handcuffed to a serial contrarian. No, l am not... OK. My bed is made. l suggest you toil on your own. Now, if this cross-examination is over, l'd like to take a crap. Romo, that story you told about the girl - the woman - that you loved, and getting over her, is it true? Hey! Was it true? Yes. For him. Files from <i>Colonial One.</i> Finally. l thought l'd get all these after the trial. Hold it. Put that on the floor, now. Oh, for frak's sake. l was there when Kelly X-rayed 'em. It's papers. There you go. Good? Yeah. No! (guard) You have five minutes, Major. Thank you. Before the hounds got to it. Open it. The president's glasses. She looks better without them. Less serious. Serious catches on in the courtroom. Your father's. When? From the deck. Right after you found the bomb underneath the Raptor. Here, kitty, kitty. Ow. - It was hanging by a thread. - They tarnish so fast. It was like that when l plucked it. Everybody else - Tigh, the others, you - all shiny. The soldier in him has had enough for a while. He'll be glad to sit in that courtroom and fire his missiles there. Ms Prosecuting Attorney down the hall. It's not what you think. It was appropriated with the noblest of intentions. See, the soles... See how the soles are worn. She drags her feet. You're catching on. And the rest? What's all this? My demons. l borrow things. My parents disappeared when l was nine years old. They were kidnapped. Murdered for... for the money they had on them, which wasn't enough. l went to live with an uncle. Stole from him until l could run away. So what did you take from me? Hm. l was thinking, the photograph that you carry. Of the girl. The pilot. The one you carry on you. But... you've had enough stolen from you already. l'll try and get these back to her... somehow. The other pocket. At the back. The guards took it from her. l borrowed it from them. l still have a case... pending. If you want to help - if you dare to help - get this to my client. - A case? - l have a calling. Yeah. So the ringing in my ears tells me. OK. You better explain this. - Don't even know what it is. - Well, l do. Where did you get it? The one who scolded you like a schoolboy. Frakking with your head. Whatshisname, Mr Serious... Uh... Kelly. - Kel... Kelly? - Yeah. l never would have let Athena go airborne with you in the Raptor. - l would have stopped it. You know that. - Yeah, l know that. You better lock me up. And l don't want any trial. l won't stop. l will keep trying. l'll keep at it. l will. l did my job, sir. And l have done my job for two years now. Every day, l sent people out to fight. l cleared them all to die. So many people. l just got tired of living with that. If you asked that man if he had to choose... between giving his life up for a Cylon or a human, what do you think he would say? l had to do something. XO. Reinstate Major Adama as commander of the air group. Effective immediately. - It's good to have you back. - Thank you. l'm sorry. l guess l was wrong. l made it worse. - No. - No, you should be in your bird. l think l should be with Lampkin. Well, now that we know that it was Kelly, we can ease up a little bit on security. In his condition, Lampkin needs help preparing the trial, presenting his case. The president has a few possibilities. She's looking. Dad, why not me? l'm close to the case. l've read the documents. - l understand Lampkin's strategy. - We have things under control. Lampkin will have help. - l wanna do this. - You're a CAG. You're not a lawyer. Far from it. And you're a judge? No. But like the four other men picked, l'm capable of listening to the evidence and making an ethical decision. And l'm capable of helping Lampkin. Forget it. l need you as CAG. Why did you give me those books? Huh? - You gave me your father's law books. - l made a mistake. - Why? Are you afraid that l'll be like him? - You're a pilot. With Zak gone and Kara gone, you need someone to carry the flag? You're a pilot and you're my son. l will not look across that court and see you sitting on the other side. See me? Or see someone else? Report for duty. Is that an order? You're in way over your head. Report for duty. Is that an order? l'm through giving you orders. Remove Apollo from the board. Inform Helo he's to remain at CAG. My son has more important things to tend to. Hey, how's the leg? You mean my lucky break? It gave me a reason not to come up here. Sooner or later, you run out of excuses. (Apollo) It's hard to let her go. Lee. l'll see you around. (Lampkin) "There is no greater ally, no force more powerful, no enemy more resolved, than a son who chooses to step
