You relive days? Jack, what you thought was happening to you... ...it happens to me. - I just wonder sometimes. - About...? Consequences. Ripples in fate. He is not like you. He is the opposite of you. - You save lives and he... - Takes them. You have no idea what you're doing. You save someone who shouldn't be here, there are consequences. You think I'm messing up some grand plan? Maybe I am the plan! What's gonna keep us from going in the same circles? This weekend, let's talk. About everything. Okay. Oh, Luc. Look at me. Come on. My mother had the calling, and she passed it on to me. If you think for one minute that I am ever gonna stop, you're wrong. You should know one thing. This is bigger than you think. You have no idea what you've begun. Get in. Tell me, what does my daughter know? Why don't I start with what she doesn't know. That you once did what I do. She's tough. You'll have your work cut out for you. - I love a challenge. - Well, Jack... ...I believe you've got one. - <i>Hello?</i> - All right, I'm here. We've been though this, Tru. You know exactly what to do. - Okay, I'm in. - <i>Okay, good.</i> Now, remember where you need to go. - Johnson, 201. - I don't see it. Turn left, third door on the right. And relax, you're good at this. This is what you were meant to do. I'm here, Davis. I made it. I can 't believe it. First day of med school. Yeah, almost. What do you mean "almost"? Well, I'm only auditing. If it wasn't for all those strings you pulled... - <i>Tru, Tru, listen.</i> - What? It's okay to be proud of yourself. Thanks, Davis. Bye. - Harrison. - <i>It's me.</i> - I've got some interesting news. - You found Jack? No, one-track mind, I haven't found Jack. Forgive me. When someone kills my boyfriend... ...then disappears for two months, I get obsessed. It's a good point. It's a good point, but no. Dad's in town. - Dad? - Okay, everyone, take your seats. Yeah, he wants to have lunch. Wouldn 't say why. Hey, listen, I really gotta run. I'm gonna be late for another delivery. Oh. Might wanna congratulate me. Six weeks on a job. It's a personal best. - Congrats, Harry. - Ms. Davies? I gotta go. Yes, professor. Just because your coroner friend used his pull to get you into my class... ...doesn't mean you won't be held to the same standards as real students. - Real students? I am a real student. - Okay. Perhaps you'd care to tell me which artery terminates as a nasopalatine artery. I, uh... It's a maxillary artery. You're in medical school now, Ms. Davies. You only have one decision to make. Are you committed to saving lives or not? - Yes, I'm committed. - How reassuring for all of us. Now, moving on to things that actually matter... - Are you moving here? - Crime's up. Business is good for a defense attorney. An office in the city was a natural. - What about Jordan and the kids? - Weekends. It's not ideal, but they understand. So tell me, how's Tru doing? I know how upset she was after what happened to Luc. She's tough. She'll feel better once she finds out who killed him. Promise me something: You won't let her get too obsessed. It's too late. Enough small talk. I wanna tell you why I asked you here. Since I'm opening an office, I need some help. Investigators, researchers, resourceful young people. Like yourself. Wait, are you offering me a job? What do you say? Wanna come work for the old man? - You turned it down? - Yeah. I told you, I got a job. And I know it might not be glamorous, but it's legit. And it's mine. I did it on my own. You know, what's funny is, my whole life, I just wished Dad... ...would start acting like a real father. And now that he is, I don't need him. - Oh, no. No, no. Wait, wait. - What's wrong? What...? The van. The van. I parked it right here, the company van. - Is it towed? - No, no, not towed. I fed the meter and everything. What...? Glass. Broken glass. Somebody stole it. They stole it, Tru. They stole the... Oh! Personal business. Personal business. I'm cooked. They're gonna can me, Tru. - Okay, just relax, okay? Just... - Relax? Look, I love that job. I'm good at it. Damn it. You see that? You see what happens? I try to live an honest life, and look. We'll think of something, I promise, okay? Just call in sick, and I promise you we'Il... - What? - <i>Hey, I think your guy's here.</i> - <i>Took 10 grand off me.</i> - Right now? - <i>Yeah. I'll stall him if you want.</i> - Okay, cool. All right, thanks. - Hey, that was my bookie. - Uh, about the honest life... Let me finish. Someone matching Jack's description showed up to collect 10 big ones. - Where? - 111 Grand Street. He's stalling him till you get there. But, hey, what you are you gonna do when you get there? Tru. Tru! You're welcome. What the hell was that, Jack? Tru. What a nice surprise. Kids today. Not even a thank-you. So, what, now you save lives? One, who's to say that truck would've actually killed her? And two, why do you look so surprised? Because you take lives, you don't save them. I guess you don't listen so well, Tru. I preserve fate. Until a day restarts, I'm no different than him or her... ...or you. - Oh, you are different. I don't kill someone's boyfriend and then disappear for two months. Living in the past can be so debilitating, don't you think? You thought killing Luc would make me stop? Well, guess what, it only made me stronger. Preaching to the choir. I saw you myself all summer. All those people fated to die that you saved. That's right. I didn't lose once. While you did what, exactly? - Traveled. Relaxed. - Death took a holiday? But you know what I did more than anything, Tru? I hoped. I hoped that you would come to your senses. I hoped that you would find a way to stop saving people... ...who are supposed to die. Correction, who are supposed to live. Don't you see? I gave you a gift. I gave you the perfect excuse to walk away. Actually, you gave me every reason to stay. So here we are. Right back where we started. Later, Tru. Catch you on the rewind. - I'll be waiting. - Unless I get there first. Help me. He's back, Davis. He's come back to stop me. You're ready. Nothing to worry about. You're prepared for this. Okay. So why do you look so worried? I'm not worried. I'm curious. Was she surprised to see you? I think there's some bigger surprises in store for her, Richard, wouldn't you say? Look, I told you, I can handle her. You don't need to move here. And I told you, Jack, I know my daughter. And you're gonna need all the help you can get. I have plenty of help. You. Harrison, if need be. But this is my calling, a job I was chosen to do. I can beat him. Are you ready? Because I'm certain she is. Oh, you're proud of her. That's cute. But I gave her a chance to stop, and she didn't take it. - So I'll stop her myself. - Confidence. You remind me of myself when I had your job. Except I won. Until the day restarts, you've done all you can. I gotta get upstairs. I'm running late for my psych evaluation. Right, with the staff shrink. Good luck, Davis. Well, it's just a formality. Tom Jordan and I are old friends. Tom's been representing me for years. - Okay, Tom, let's get this over with. - "Get this over with"? - Oh, I'm looking for Tom Jordan. - He's gone on indefinite medical leave. - Oh, I didn't know he was sick. - Yeah. Oh. I'm sorry, how rude. I'm Dr. Carrie Allen. I'm his replacement. - And you must be... - I'm Davis. Davis. Here. - You are two hours late, Dr. Davis. - It's actually just Davis. Oh. I actually assumed that you weren't going to show up at all. No, I like psychological tests. Ink blots and such. Call me crazy. I know you're probably nervous about this. But the wonderful thing about my test: There are no wrong answers. - Okay. - All I need you to do... ...is look at this picture and tell me the first thing that pops into your head. - No wrong answers? - No wrong answers. That is the lost continent of Atlantis and the puppy that I never got as a child. Yeah, I think he should take the job, Dad, but you know Harry. - He likes to do things on his own. - Incoming. Right, Dad, but look, I gotta go. I'll call you later, okay? My father, Ward Cleaver all of a sudden. Oh, no. Cop. Harbor Patrol officer. She died answering a distress call in the bay. Kate Wilson responded to an SOS call at 3:07 p.m. Some college kids lost control of a boat called the <i>Green Hornet</i>. - Sounds routine. - Would've been. - Except for the white squall. - White squall? A storm that comes unexpectedly, no real warning... ...till, bang, you're in the middle of it. - A swell knocked her overboard. - What about her partner? Couldn't get to her. Waves were too rough. It's a miracle he didn't drown. That'd be me. Duty calls. - She's all yours, Tru. See you. - Later. Lost consciousness when hypothermia set in. Fluid in her lungs. No surprise there. Keep that up, you won't need me here anymore. - Yeah, that will be the day. - No, I'm serious. It's nice to know if anything happens to me... ...that you could take over on your own. - Look, is this about Jack? - It's not about Jack. Jack. - It's about Carrie. - Carrie? Dr. Allen. Tom Jordan's replacement. My psychological test didn't go over too well... ...and she's requested more testing. What does that mean? - Could mean, you know, nothing. - Or? Or it could mean that I'm... ...crazy, clinically speaking. And if the test results show that, then I won't be here anymore. - They won't let me. - No, that's not possible. Actually, it is. First I get humiliated at med school, then Jack shows up and now this. What next? Save me. Here we go again. - It's me. - <i>Why are you calling now?</i> - You're not due in class for three hours. - I know. It's one of those days. - Okay. Who's the lucky victim? - Kate Wilson, Harbor Patrol. She died in a white squall. Whoa. You don't hear about that every day. Need an address or something? No, already got one. I did my homework. She starts work any minute. Okay, what can I do for you? You can listen very carefully, because you missed quite a day yesterday. Jack came back, my father moved to town... ... and you flunked your psych exam. What? Tom Jordan would never flunk me. No, but his replacement would. Dr. Carrie Allen, the new staff shrink. What, a woman? Well, did I find her attractive? Because if I did, that would explain a lot. Hey, Davis, I gotta go. Stupid question. Of course I found her attractive. - Officer Wilson? - Yes? Hey, I'm Tru Davies. I'm interested in Harbor Patrol, I'm told you're the woman to talk to. - And who told you that? - Question is, who didn't? I've asked around, and you've got a lot of fans. Nice to see the checks have been clearing. I would love to pick your brain, get some pointers on the exam. Kate, let's get a move on. I'm late for my patrol. But tell you what, I have a lunch break at 1. Meet me here, and I'll tell you what you need to know. Great, thank you. I'll see you at 1. - <i>Hey</i>. - Hey, Harry, it's me. That's so weird. I was just about to call you. - I know. That's why I called you first. - <i>Oh, got it. One of those days.</i> All right, what do I need to know? Just try to act surprised when Dad offers you a job. A job? Really? - Well, did I take it? - No, you turned it down. But let the old man down easy. He took it pretty hard. Well, see, that's great, because they love me at this job. Yeah, well, maybe not for long. What did I do? Look, your van got stolen while you were at lunch. The day rewound before I talked to you again. My advice is, move the van. All right, consider it moved. Ms. Davies, good of you to join us. - Yeah. I'm really sorry. - Ms. Davies... ...just because your coroner friend used his pull to get you into my class... ...doesn't mean you won't be held to the same standards as real students. - Real students? I am a real student. - Okay. Then tell me, which artery terminates at the nasopalatine artery? That would be the maxillary artery. Of course, the nasopalatine itself ends as the posterior septal branches... ...after it crosses under the surface of the sphenoid. Ballpark? Yes. That's right. That's absolutely right. There's nothing doing out here today. What do you say we head back? - What's that? - Hold on, give them a second. Go. - Come on. - I'm going in. Kate! Come on. Come on, Kate. You saved my life. I have no idea what happened. I was just paddling along, and next thing I knew... - You're fine now. Everything's okay. - You're a very lucky man. Don't I know it. Thanks. The things we take for granted, huh? Never a dull moment. Ow. Come here, let me see. You must've smacked your head when you tipped. Sit down. Thank God you were out there. The last thing I remember is getting in my kayak. Next thing, lights out. - Don't get on the water much, do you? - What gave it away? Well, the truth is, my sister's sailing into town tonight... ...and when we get together, a boat race is inevitable. So I figured I'd polish up on my skills before she got into town. Guess I'm getting a little old to let the competitive spirit get the best of me. Oh, where are my manners? I'm... I'm Jack Harper. - Hey. Kate Wilson. - Hey. Maybe next time you should just let your sister win by forfeit. Well, thanks to you, there will be a next time. Officer Wilson? - Yes, Mr. Harper? - Um... Here's the deal. Believe it or not, you're not the first person who saved my life. I didn't save your life. The first person was a trauma surgeon in Irvine, California. Pulled a bullet out of my neck and sutured arteries... ...so I wouldn't bleed to death. - I'm sorry. The point is, by the time I came out of the coma... ...Dr. Trakk had been transferred back East... ...and I never got the chance to say thank you. Not the right way, anyway. So I swore to myself that if I was ever unlucky enough... ...to need someone to save my life again... ...I would find a way to express my gratitude properly. Your kayak flipped. Chances are, you would've pulled yourself out if I hadn't come along. Well, at least let me buy you lunch. Lunch? Um... Let me get my things together and... - You can wait a moment? - I got nothing but time. Kate? - Oh, hi, Tru. - Ready for that cup of coffee? Oh, damn. I'm sorry, it completely slipped my mind. I just made lunch plans with Mr. Harper. Hey. Jack Harper. Officer Wilson just fished me out of the bay. - What a shame. - Tru's interested in joining Harbor Patrol. Oh. - Bored with your day job? - Just looking for some new challenges. I see. Competition at work's not to your liking. It's fine. It's just not as good as it thinks it is. Look, why don't we just reschedule. I can meet you any morning next week. - No, we can't. - We can't? This entrance exam is next week, and we really need to talk. - And we will, just not right now. - Kate, really, this is more complicated... Officer, if this lady's bothering you, I could call someone. Thanks, I'm fine. Listen, I don't know what your deal is... ...but do us both a favor and find someone else to help you. I'm gonna put my things away. - Meet you in the office? - Okay. Ah, the eager recruit. A classic. Too bad it's not gonna work. Too bad she didn't let you drown. You know, I missed this, Tru. I really did. You can be so entertaining when you're losing. - You haven't won anything yet. - No. No, I haven't. But the beauty of my job is, I don't have to change anything. I merely have to prevent you from changing anything. And from where I sit, Kate's day is right on course. Feeling pretty good about yourself right about now? Yeah, I'm getting there. Anyway, it's been lovely to see you, Tru, but I'm late for a lunch date. And don't worry, I'll make sure Kate's last meal is a memorable one. No one should die on an empty stomach. Look, the day is very young. No reason you can't win this one. Two hours to go, Davis. Kate died after answering an SOS at 3:07 yesterday. So far, I've done nothing to change that. - What's Jack up to? - Probably his shrimp appetizer. - He took Kate to lunch. - Winning the war of hearts and minds. It's hard to convince people they're in danger. It's that much harder with Jack working against you. Okay, well, if you can't stop Kate from answering the distress call... ...then maybe you can stop the distress call itself. Right. There's no danger if there's no one to save. Some college kids lost control of a boat called the <i>Green Hornet</i>. Thanks, I'm on it. Just one thing I need you to do. - Yeah? What's that? - Find a way to ground Kate's boat. You mean ground the police boat? Yeah, we have to cover our bases and stay one step ahead of Jack. Well, you're one step ahead of me. You can't ground a police boat, Tru. You'll think of something, I know you will. All right? Okay, bye. People think I'm crazy around here. Jeez. She's a beauty. Fiberglass hull, Evinrude engine. Yeah, it's my father's. Thinks of it as the son he never had. - So can I help you with something? - Actually, I think I can help you. I'm a volunteer with the Harbor Patrol. There's a storm advisory for the bay... ...so we're grounding all recreational crafts. - You're kidding me. - I wish I was. Hasn't exactly made me Miss Popularity today. No, I mean... Man, I thought he was nuts. - What's that? - I'm guessing you're Tru, right? Yeah. Some guy paid me a visit this morning, said you might stop by today. - And he told me to give you this. - A guy? Said you'd try to ruin my trip. Something about a storm. I thought he was crazy. No, you have to trust me. It's not safe out there today. With people like you around, the bay sounds like the safest place I could be. Hey, this is Harrison. Stolen? What? You're kidding. Ground a police boat. Ground a police boat. Okay. Hi, this is Admiral McNulty of the Fifth Fleet. I was pulling in port today. I couldn't help but notice... ...a vessel, starboard side, that was... - Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm Dr. Allen. - Tom Jordan's replacement. - Oh, God. My psych evaluation. Can you hold on a second? Yeah, you're about a half an hour late, so I decided to come down... ...and see what was keeping you. And now I know. You were making phony phone calls. - It's not... It's not what you think it is. - Really? Why don't go ahead and explain it to me then, admiral. It's a funny story, actually. The... - Okay, maybe it's not that funny. It's... - The good news, doctor? I don't think you'll be needing that psych evaluation after all... ...because I'm thinking that I have all the answers that I need. Hello? Yeah, I'm still here. - Thanks again for lunch. - Thanks again for saving my life. Hey, I know this might sound a little forward... ...but there's a street festival downtown that's supposed to be a ton of fun. I know that look. You're flattered, but you have a girl... ...who wouldn't appreciate me asking you out. You're right, I do have a girl. My sister's sailing into town tonight, and we have a lot of catching up to do. Sure. Right. Anyway, it's none of my business, so... But... ...I am free all day tomorrow. Great. Me too. Kate! Come on, let's go. But you should probably leave. If they see me loafing anymore... ...they'll dry-dock me. I won't be able to make any rescues. - Right. Well, we wouldn't want that. - See you tomorrow. Tomorrow. Right. - Kate, hi. - Tru, we are way past amusing here. You have to listen to me. It's not safe for you out there today. Maybe this job isn't for you, but it's what I do. I save people. - Like Jack Harper? - Yeah, exactly. Things aren't always as they seem. - Are you saying I didn't save Jack? - I'm saying things can be deceiving. Like right now, the water's calm, but that can change so quickly. - So? - A storm can come on without warning. - A white squall or... - A white squall? Tru, you've been watching too many movies. The weather's beautiful. We haven't had a distress call since this morning. Responded to an SOS call at 3:07 p.m. Mayday! This is the Green Hornet. Our location: We're just past the drilling platform. We're taking on water. We're in trouble. - This is Harbor Patrol. We're on our way. - Kate. Kate, wait. Nothing's gonna happen to me. Today's no different. - But it is. Let me come with you. - Should I answer, or is laughter enough? Come on, let's go. I know what it's like to wanna save people, but we can't save everyone. Well, maybe you can't, but I can. Green Hornet, this is Harbor Patrol. Restate your position. We're just past the drilling platform. Please hurry, the engine's dead. Green Hornet, can you hear me? Green Hornet? Damn it! Oh, my God. - What the hell is that? - She was right. We can't go into that. We won't come out. We have to. They need us. We have to. This is the Coast Guard. Spotted the vessel. Got a tow line. Bringing her in. Over. Coast Guard, this is Harbor Patrol. Do you need assistance? Over. Under control. Got a tip from Admiral McNulty, Fifth Fleet. - <i>Didn 't know there was a Fifth Fleet.</i> - Let's get the hell out of here. - You're okay. - Coast Guard took the call. Someone called in a tip. Good one, Davis. You know, I'm not quite sure what you're all about... ...but I trust you're gonna leave me alone now? Gladly. Who says I can't save everyone? - <i>Hello</i>? - Nice call on the Coast Guard. - I didn't think they had jurisdiction. - They don't. I was very convincing. - What time do you have? - Four-fifteen. Tru? - What? - Kate is safe. You averted her death. - You did all you were supposed to do. - The rules have changed. Jack is back. Until I have him in my sights, I can't trust that I've won. He has to be here. Jack saved this little girl yesterday at exactly 4: 16. If his job really is to preserve fate, then he has to save her again today. That's right. In Jack's view, letting someone die who's meant to live... ...is just as bad as letting someone live who was meant to die. Well, let's hope he's as good at his job as he thinks he is. Okay, Davis, it's showtime. Hey. Your skateboard, you don't have it. Some guy just bought it from me for $50. Jack. Sorry for being so pushy... ...but just couldn't stay away. It's really starting to come down out there. I thought you had plans tonight. I did, but my sister called. She's running late... ...so looks like I'm free. That's funny, so am I. I asked some guy out this afternoon, but he said no. Now, what kind of fool would do that? Okay, listen, I get off shift in about 10 minutes. - So you think you can wait? - You bet. Okay. Mayday. This is a fishing vessel. Cloud One. Excuse me. Harbor Patrol. Please state the position and nature of your emergency. Over. There's a boat. It's out in the storm. It's flipping. Please state your position. Over. Just past the buoy at the mouth of the bay. - And the boat, can you identify it? - <i>No, wait.</i> It's the Jezebel. That's what it's called. The <i>Jezebel</i>? No, that's the ship my sister's sailing in on tonight. They were running late, but everything was fine. Harbor Patrol, there's a girl. She's overboard. She's in the water. Harbor Patrol's responding. - Kate. - It's my job, Jack. Harbor Patrol. How did I know you were gonna answer? - How did I know you'd be calling? - What did you say? What did you say to get her back out there? - She's saving my sister, Tru. - Your sister's dead. Oops. Kate Wilson was fated to die this afternoon, Jack, and I saved her. Yes. Yes, you did. But the day's not over yet... ...and therefore, my window of opportunity is still open. And luckily for me... ...this storm just keeps getting worse. - <i>Kate helps people. She saves lives.</i> Good people have to die too, Tru. You know that as well as I. You say you're not a killer, but what the hell do you call what you're doing? My job. Later, Tru. Really not a good time, Harry. But you will not believe what happened. - They stole the van again? - No, not that. That's not the problem. See, apparently, the Gerber brothers, they run some sort of scam. Yeah, they boost their own van, and they collect the insurance money. Yeah. I parked in a secured lot, and almost screwed up the whole thing. Here I thought I was, like, living this clean life. But no. No, I've been working for crooks the entire time. - I'm sorry, Harry, but I'll call you later. - <i>Yeah, yeah.</i> Don't worry. She's gonna be fine. This is what I do. I'm sorry, that... I've just been wanting to do that all day. - Kate? - Yeah? We'll have dinner another time. - Yeah? - <i>Everything back on track?</i> I almost thought you really saw her boat out there, Richard. I'm impressed. I'm glad to be of help, Jack, but next time, do it yourself. Pan-Pan. Pan-Pan. This is Harbor Patrol. Pan-Pan. This is Harbor Patrol. Damn. No! No! Kate. Kate. Hang on, I'm coming. Hang on, Kate. Got you. Just hold on, Kate, I've got you. Come on. Come on, Kate, it's okay. Okay. You're gonna be okay. Thank you. Here. You're all right. Doctor. Hi. I was just getting ready to go upstairs to apologize. I'm sorry about what happened in there. Really? I was just on my way down to tell you not to bother. I spent the evening going through your file, doctor. - Oh, boy, my file. - And you know what I found? Glowing personnel reviews, meritorious raises... ...and commendations from everybody, from the mayor to the chief of police. - My file? - So, what I'm saying is, doctor... ...if you feel the need to do crazy things now and again to blow off steam... ...well, maybe somebody has to be a little crazy... ...to work here in the first place. I'm saying I think the evaluation can wait. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't think that we've been properly introduced. Hi. - I'm Dr. Carrie Allen. - I'm Davis. Pleased to make your acquaintance. I am so glad you changed your mind. It's gonna be great working together. Yes. It will be great to make an honest living. Listen, maybe this job is gonna give us, I don't know... ...a chance to make up for lost time, for my mistakes. There is still a lot we can learn from each other. - Yeah. - About each other. - What? - Wouldn't it be ironic if you and I... ...were a lot more alike than people thought? - Refill? - No. I'm gonna get out of here. I wanna be fresh, impress that new boss. Yeah. See you tomorrow. - You got sloppy today. - Thanks, coach. Don't take it so hard. I told you she was good. Well, at least one of us won today. - Harrison? - Signed and sealed. Starts tomorrow. - Gonna tell him? - In time. I just told him I'm proud of him. One bombshell at a time. He's a good kid. He'll be an asset. But he does love his sister, and that bond is stronger than you think. So's the bond between father and son. Night, Jack. Get some rest. Apparently, you'll be needing it. I thought I heard you come in. I beat him, Davis. I beat Jack. Saved Kate, gave fate what it wanted. So why doesn't it feel like enough? Because it wasn't Luc. Is that how it goes? I save strangers, but I lose the people I love? - Tru... - Sorry. I'm fine, really. - It was a momentary lapse of... - Humanity. Anyway, it's late. I better go. Good night, Davis. Night. Oh, by the way... ...what did Jack say
