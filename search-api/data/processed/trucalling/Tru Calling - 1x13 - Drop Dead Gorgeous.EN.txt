I don't care what you told them, Marty. I'm not gonna sing. My friend at <i>The Times</i> says they'll send their best photographer. I don't know what I'd do without you. Hi. Hi. Will you be moving sometime today, or should I go change in my car? Sorry. You know this room is only for contestants, right? I am a contestant. Right, of course you are. My name's Jackie. No offense, sweetie, but I'm not looking to make friends today. I'm looking to win. - Hello? - Tru Davies? May I ask who's caIIing? Sorry, how rude of me. Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i> The newspaper. Some peopIe think so. Anyway, I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions. Actually, I'm not interested in a subscription. That's not why I'm caIIing. I've been looking through police reports over the past several months. All sorts: an attempted murder- for- hire scheme, suspected mass poisoning, and so on. And the only thing all these very different crimes have in common is... well, you. I'm not sure I understand-- In aII the cases I've Iooked at... you were cited by the wouId- be victim as the reason he or she was stiII aIive. Every time. It's really quite remarkable. I'm sure it's some sort of coincidence. Well, that's just it. I'm not. For a city morgue worker, you spend a lot of time in the police blotter. You know, now really isn't a good time. ShouId I caII you Iater? Maybe I could just call you. Fine. The paper will find me wherever I am. - I look forward to your call. - Great. Help me. I am not depressed. I'm just-- Single. Linds, Luc and I just weren't meant to be. If you ask me, he'll be begging to get back with you any day now. Anyway, I'd better run. That's right, you've got that beauty pageant thing today. I still can't believe you talked your firm into running it. I know. They're also letting me pick one of the judges, so I had this brainstorm. Since they're looking for a regular girl... who better to choose one than a common man. Don't tell me. Harrison. And your girlfriend knows nothing about this? Not a thing. She trusts me completely. - You're not getting cold feet now, are you? - Me? Please. With yours truly on the judges panel, I can practically guarantee... that your daughter will be the next Miss Fresh Face. "Practically"? There're three judges on the panel. I'm only one of them. Listen, Harry, Angela made it this far on her own. Your proposal, as creative as it may be... is null and void should Angela finish any lower than, let's say... first place? Marlon, be reasonable, man. I am. You pay me four large right now, and I'm reasonable. You make sure Angela wins, I'm also reasonable. Anything else, I'm not so reasonable. Hey. You're here early. I'm not staying. I want to return this to County Records. - Your mom's autopsy report? - Yeah. - Anything new? - No. Standard B and E gone bad. Single bullet, massive blood loss. I only read it 15 times, and still think there's something I must have missed. Tru, if I may, sometimes there is just a single bullet. A lone gunman, a tragic death. Sometimes, the truth is exactly what it appears to be. - What makes you say that? - Eight years of working here. I just wish I thought so, too. See you tonight. Yeah. Hello? I knew it. I knew this girl was gonna be trouble. Two minutes before the pageant starts, and this finalist drops out. - Know what this means? - You're one girl short? Yeah, exactly. Now I need to find a replacement. Someone fabulous to fill in. Someone fabulous, just like-- - Not a chance. - Tru, come on. Listen, someone who holds your hair when you throw up, I'm your girl. Need a ride to the airport? Look no further. But beauty pageants is where I draw the line. - It'll be fun. - I'm so sorry, but it's just not happening. Thanks anyway, Tru. Bye. Hello, and welcome to the First Annual Miss Fresh Face Pageant. Now Iet's join our judges in weIcoming our first contestant.: Miss AngeIa Todd. AngeIa's a recent graduate of OakviIIe.... By the way, I was checking out the contestants backstage. Angela girl, very impressive. Smart as a whip, and quite the pleasing disposition. I Iike rock. But that's just me. Okay, AngeIa. If you couId have dinner with any figure from history... who wouId you have dinner with? That's a good question, Chuck. I'd have to say KeIIy CIarkson. AngeIa, Iet me cIarify. Any figure from history-- KeIIy CIarkson. Wow! AngeIa, thank you. Wasn't she great? Wow. There is a girl with conviction! An all too rare quality in our young people today. Excuse me. - Miss Walker? - Yes, Mr. Barnes? - We have a problem. - We do? - I am fired? - I'm sorry, okay? Julian Barnes said you were playing favorites... - trying to influence the other judges. - That's crazy. I know, but he's the boss. But what about you and me, and the sharing of your work... and all that stuff? Doesn't that count for anything? Of course it does. That's why I saved you a seat right in the front row. Perfect. Tru? Luc. I'm glad I ran into you, because I wanted to talk to you about something. In person. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, it's just.... Look, this isn't easy to say, but I'm gonna try. If you ask me, he'll be begging to get back with you any day now. Take your time. These things are important. Yeah, that's why I wanted to talk to you face to face. Now that we're not together anymore... it's inevitable we're gonna start dating other people. And since we work together, I know that could be awkward. That's why I wanted you to know that I'm going on a date tonight. Oh. I hope I did the right thing. I just didn't want you finding out some other way. No, of course. I appreciate that. Anyway, I should get to work. It's funny. We've known each other for three months... and this is the first time I've left a conversation before you did. Hello? It's me. And I need you now. Can it wait? Yeah... - if you want to see me in a full body cast. - I'll be there as soon as I can. Sorry, but I've got to run. Why aren't I surprised? She graduated with honors from the IocaI community coIIege... and Jackie majored in education. Let me get this straight. You convinced your girlfriend... to make you a judge in order to rig the voting... so the daughter of your loan shark would finish first? You know, that's a very poorly constructed sentence. I hardly know what you're talking about. Fine, yes. That's why I need to borrow $4, 000 from you. I don't have $4, 000. I figured. So, I don't know, $40 and tomorrow's winning lottery numbers? Now teII us, Jackie, why shouId you be the next Miss Fresh Face? I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm sorry. Okay. Moving right aIong. That poor girl. These pageants can be rough. Yeah, and I thought I had problems. Let me ask you, if you don't pay this guy, what would he do to you? I'll put it this way. I may be asking for your help tonight from beyond. Harrison. I'm joking. You start saving dead people, and suddenly you lose your sense of humor. Don't worry. I'll think of something. - I'm having a really nice time. - Me, too. This might sound like a strange question... but you have no reason to run off in the middle of the meal, do you? No. Not unless you ask me to. How about we make a deal? I won't ask you, if you don't volunteer. Sounds perfect. Okay, Iadies and gentIemen. And the votes are in from our remaining judges. Now, the first runner- up... who wiII step in shouId our winner be unabIe to perform her duties is... Don't say"Angela Todd." Do not say-- ...Miss AngeIa Todd! Oh, crap. And the officiaI new face of JuIian Barnes Cosmetics... winner of the cash prize, the modeIing contract... and the Iifetime suppIy of cosmetics is... Miss AIex ReynoIds! We're aII as excited to have Miss ReynoIds aboard as you are. But what do you say we give her a chance to freshen up before taking more photos? Seriously. My makeup must be a mess. Thank you. Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen. - All right, we're out of here. - What's up? Let's just say some people have some major anger issues. We can't get out this way. - Why not? - Because we need a pass. Excuse me, Frank. I was a judge, remember? Come on. Man, I was so close. All I had to do was convince the other two... and I would've been.... Hey, track star, pick up the pace here. You should stop borrowing money and getting into these situations. Okay, Dad. - Did I imagine that or.... - I think it came from over there. I don't know if right now is a good time to be taking the scenic route. What happened? It's Jackie. She was like this when I came in. Go call the police now. So she's.... Dead. They just always seem to find you, don't they? Unfortunately, yes. So, is.... - So, is now when it happens? - What? When she asks for help. The dead chick. I don't know when it happens. It just happens. Do me a favor. Go stand outside the door. We need to keep the crime scene intact. Sorry, but I have got to see this. There's no guarantee it's gonna happen. Even if it does, you won't remember it tomorrow... because it wouldn't have happened yet. Yeah.... I think I'm just gonna wait outside. Help me. Hey, it's Tru. Leave a message. Hi, this is MicheIIe Carey at the Post Dispatch. Tell you what. Since I seem to have missed you at home, why don't I just give you a call at work? Just once. Just once I'd like to go somewhere and have everyone stay alive. Is that too much to ask? - You really want me to answer that? - No, actually I don't. - What do you know about the victim? - Not much. Just that she broke down and ran off during her Q and A section. Well, those questions can be tough. So I'm told. Anything on the body? There was some nasty discoloration under her eyes. - Puffy? - More like burned. Doesn't ring any bells, but I'll look into it. Let me know. First things first, I've got to convince Jackie to drop out. Not like she's gonna win anything tonight. What, and shatter her dreams of becoming Miss Fresh Face? No, I'm gonna save her life. Hey. If a reporter named Michelle Carey calls looking for me... just don't answer any questions. Questions? What kind of questions? The kind we don't want to answer. That kind. Right. I'm going on a date tonight. Hey, Tru, I was hoping I'd run into you. - Yeah? - Yeah, the reason is-- Actually, there's something that I've been wanting to talk to you about. Okay. It's just now that we're not together anymore... it's inevitable we'll start dating other people. And us working together, things might get awkward. I just wanted to let you know that it's fine with me. Really? I just hope you find someone that makes you happy. I just hope you find someone that makes you happy. But I thought that, I mean.... - I got to run. - Go. Yeah, right. Tru. I was just gonna call you. This is so perfect. Really? What's going on? One of the girls just dropped out, two minutes before the pageant. - And I need someone fabulous to fill-- - I'm in. - Really? - Yeah, whatever you need. Wow, I'm shocked. I totally thought it was gonna be a long shot. So should I get backstage? - Yeah, I'll get you a pass. Just wait here. - Okay. Hey, Harr. What are you doing here? You know, stuff. Don't tell me. So, who kicked it? Me? What, was I the one? No, not you. One of the girls. - Don't tell me it was Angela Todd. - Her name's Jackie. Man, can you believe it? Murder at Lindsay's fashion show... - where I'm a judge and you're-- - A contestant. Oh, my God. You? I'm sorry, I didn't.... - It's the only way to get close to her. - Yeah. While you're having a good laugh... let me just mention that your little scheme isn't gonna work. What's that? Fixing a beauty pageant for your loan shark? What were you thinking? It's hard enough saving these people... without always having to bail your ass out of trouble. But that's our thing, right? Just try not to be so obvious. You got yourself kicked off the judging panel yesterday. Good to know. Okay, come on, let's get you backstage. So this is the replacement? - Yeah, Tru. I need you to get into your dress for the first round. Eveningwear. This was so last- minute. I don't have a dress. You can borrow one of mine. Help me. - Thanks. - Don't worry about it. Couldn't decide, so I brought four. It sounds like a plan. Okay, let's kick it into high gear, girls. Hi, I'm Tru. Jackie. I heard a rumor there was a late entry. So you must be the new girl? Nice to meet you. So what, you just decided over breakfast that you wanted to be Miss Fresh Face? Actually, yeah. Unbelievable. They'll let anybody into these things. - Is she always so warm? - Afraid so. But it's not just Alex. It's all of them. I guess catty competition's just not my thing. I thought it could be fun, but these girls will do anything to win. Before we start, I'd Iike to introduce you to our judges. PIease weIcome the CEO of JuIian Barnes Cosmetics... Mr. JuIian Barnes! Our next judge is a former spokesmodeI who, if you ask me... looks like she shouId be back here with the rest of our finaIists. I know JuIian thinks so, and that's why he married her! Ladies and gentIemen, pIease weIcome Adrian Barnes! And our man on the street, Mr. Harrison Davies. There's something I got to tell you, and it's gonna sound weird, but-- Come on, you look so serious all of a sudden. Let's talk inside. Tyler? What are you doing here? - Jackie, I uh, look, I missed you and... - I told you not to come. Just listen to me, okay? Go away! - The least you can do is give me a chance. - Tyler, there is nothing left to say. I live here now. This is my home. You have to go. No, I'm not leaving. I came halfway across the country to see you. Is there a problem in here? Please. Just leave. - But-- - You heard the lady. - Probably a good idea. - Don't bother. This way, sir. I'll find my way out. My ex. Not exactly a clean break. I moved here to start over. I never thought he'd come looking for me. Trust me, men are never predictable. - Here, try this one. It'll look great on you. - Thanks. Last question: If you couId have dinner.... - What did he do? - Nothing. In fact, he's been quite pleasant. The problem is it's come to my attention that Mr. Davies' sister... has been slotted in as an alternate. Conflict of interest. - So, I should.... - Can him. Am I in the right place? I was told to speak with Tru Davies. Actually, she's not here. But I'd like to help you. I could help you. Or not. I need to pick up a death certificate for a relative of mine. - Actually, you'd have to go through-- - County Records, right? I was there all morning. When they finally got around to helping... they said they'd lost the original and to come here for a new one. Unfortunately, any request for a new certificate has to go through-- Please don't tell me I have to go back to County Records? I'm already four hours late for work. Well, I guess we could bend the rules just this once. - I'm sorry about your loss, Miss.... - Park. Susan Park. Now, Jackie's wearing a stunning design... from the JuIian Barnes coIIection of fine formaIwear. I hope she's kidding with that ass. Ouch! Big much? What's between you two, anyway? The only thing between me and Jackie is the crown. No one else stands a chance against me. No offense. It's just a contest. If you don't win, it's not the end of the world. You so don't get it. Winning something Iike this puts a girI on the map. To where? Mini- malls of the Eastern Seaboard? Got to start somewhere. And a word of advice. If I got into the finals because my best friend was running the show... maybe I wouldn't talk so much. Hey. - You looked really great out there. - Thanks. I've been thinking about what you said about these girls, this whole thing. And the truth is, I feel the same way. So here's an idea. Let's drop out. - Excuse me? - I'm serious. Let's get out of here. We could be halfway through a pizza before they even know we're gone. It's tempting, I have to admit. But I signed up for this thing, and I should see it through. It can't get any worse, right? Anyway, you being here is proof that not all the competition is so bad. There's something that I didn't get a chance to tell you before-- I know. I walk too fast. And if I'm not careful, I'm gonna take a nasty spill in these heels. No, that's not it. It's something else. About tonight. Tru Davies. I don't know how to tell you this, but-- Tru Davies? Talk later. Walk now. Go. Good luck. Ladies and gentIemen, Tru's a Iate entry into our IittIe pageant here. But I'm sure she's as deserving a candidate as we've seen here tonight. This is why I wanted you to come home with me. I always thought I'd propose to you once we got there... but after we argued this morning, I figured it was now or never. So, what do you say, Jacks? I want to. And I love you, Ty, more than anything. But I need some time to think about it. Whatever you need. I'm not going anywhere. Here we are: Terrance Park, 68 years old, massive coronary. Korean male. Uncle by marriage. It says here the original certificate was signed by a Jessica Park. My cousin. She was gonna come with me today... but it was so hard for her to come here the first time. - It's never easy coming to the morgue. - And yet you do it every day. You must be a very strong person... working here all alone, surrounded by death. Well, actually I oversee a small staff. Tru, right? My cousin said she dealt with somebody by that name. Yeah. Actually, I should go get you the new certificate. I'm not in any hurry. Besides... I like talking to you. Yeah. Are you okay? This might sound like a strange question... but you're not gonna run off somewhere in the middle of dinner, are you? - Not unless you want me to. - No, I don't. No, not at all. 'Cause that's one thing I can't stand... when a girl just ups and leaves right in the middle of a meal, because my-- Ex used to do that. - Did I mention that already? - Three times. Look, Tabitha, you seem like a really great girl. The truth is I thought I was ready to start dating again... but maybe I'm just not. Great. Maybe you could've thought of that before you asked me out. You know what? Here, watch me run out in the middle of the meal. This was a waste of a night. What did he do? KeIIy CIarkson. Okay, AngeIa, thank you. And now for our next contestant, Tru Davies! So, Tru, your bio says... that you work the night shift in a morgue? Yes, that's right. So teII us, how do you spend your time... when you're not out tagging toes? I heIp peopIe. So, voIunteer work? You couId say that. Alex, this is the last time I'm gonna ask you, do you understand? Did you bring it or not? It's here somewhere. I can't give it to you. At least, not yet. I haven't got time for this. I shouldn't be out here... in the middle of a Q and A. Careful, Jules. The judges take off for bruising. You know you could go out there with two black eyes and still win. I knew that tape would persuade you. Don't worry, you've got all the votes you need. That's all I wanted to hear. You're up next. Tru, in 50 words or Iess... teII us why you shouId be the next Miss Fresh Face. I wish I couId, Chuck, but I'm kind of on a tight scheduIe. Thanks. - What was that all about? - It's just the crowd. I got nervous. Too bad, because I think the judges like your look. It's the one and onIy Miss Jackie Connors. Let's give her.... Speaking of judges, where's Harrison? Speaking of judges, where's Harrison? - Yeah, I sort of had to fire him. - You what? Once you entered, there was a conflict of interest. It wouldn't have been fair to keep him on the panel. Now teII us, Jackie, why shouId you be the next Miss Fresh Face? I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm sorry. Okay. Guess I don't have to worry about her anymore. Our next contestant is.... I thought you said she was your main competition. Not after that performance. Right now, she'd be lucky to beat you. All this paperwork.... I bet you don't get out on many dates. Actually, women kind of think I'm strange. - Everything okay? - Yes. - Can you excuse me a second? - Yeah. Hello? Hey, it's me. I just heard back from the tox lab, and the discoloration around the eyes... is consistent with the topical application of an organophosphate. Most IikeIy a pesticide of some sort. You're saying she died because someone rubbed it on her skin? Organophosphate is a powerfuI nerve agent... and once it gets into the nervous system, it shuts the lungs down. - It's instant asphyxiation. - Lovely. What about you? Any suspects? I had two, and now it's none. What happened? I thought it was the angry boyfriend, but he was only looking to propose. Then it was another contestant, but Jackie just bombed the Q and A... so she's not a threat to anyone. There's got to be someone. That's the thing. There isn't. Jackie's one of the sweetest girls I've ever met. No one wants to hurt her. And she's gonna be murdered in the next 30 minutes. I got to go. I'll be in touch. Exactly who's going to be murdered in the next 30 minutes? Hey, I saw what happened out there. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. - I'm leaving. - What? This whole night is fake. The girls look fake... the winner is fake, and absolutely none of it matters. I wanna help you, but I need you to tell me exactly what's going on. It's Alex. She's got something on one of the judges. - Some sort of tape or-- - She's blackmailing him? To make sure she's declared the winner. Which means nothing we did here today counted... because the whole stupid thing was fixed. Oh, God, look at me. I'm all Tammy Faye. I can't let Ty see me like this, or he might take back his proposal. And the discoloration around the eyes... is consistent with the topicaI appIication of an organophosphate. Most likely a pesticide. Jackie, stop! Don't use that. - Why not? - Because it'll kill you. Why would Alex's makeup remover kill me? - Wait, this isn't yours? - Mine's already packed. I was just gonna borrow some of hers. But if this is Alex's.... Oh, my God. Then she was supposed to die yesterday, not you. No offense, Tru, but you're sort of freaking me out. Sorry, it's just that I think someone's trying to kill Alex. Why would anyone want to kill her? Aside from the fact she's a total B- I- you- know- what. You said she had some sort of tape that she was using... to blackmail one of the judges? To win a third- rate beauty contest is not exactly grounds for murder. I don't think it's about the pageant. I think it's about the tape. Look, maybe all the pressure is getting to you. I don't know, but I think I'm gonna.... You know, I got to say, I'm glad we met today. It was an absoIuteIy miserabIe time, and I don't ever want to do it again. But having you around.... It made a world of difference. I asked you a question. Let's get you your certificate and you can be on your way. I don't want the certificate. And my name isn't Susan Park. You Michelle Carey? I have nothing further to say to you. - What do you not want me to know? - Please leave. Is it something do with her mysterious appearance at crime scenes? Her uncanny knack for saving the lives of strangers? Listen, you are so far off. This is ridiculous. Then enlighten me. Tell me what's really going on here. Nothing is going on here. - You're saying that I imagined all of this? - Absolutely. Then let me tell you something else that I might have imagined. I did a little research, and it turns out Tru isn't the first young woman... to mysteriously pop up in the nick of time and save the lives of total strangers. There was another before her. I asked you to leave. Tell Tru I'm sorry I missed her, but I'll be sure to catch her another time. I'm not sure about this, Mr. Barnes. I'II make you a deaI.: You caII me JuIian... and I'II caII you Miss Fresh Face. But I'm not Miss Fresh Face. Not yet, but you wiII be. - Promise? - AbsoIuteIy. Now why don't we drop the chit- chat? And the officiaI new face of JuIian Barnes Cosmetics is... Miss AIex ReynoIds! Oh, crap. Big surprise? I'm sorry there can only be one Miss Fresh Face. But we'd like you to try again next year. Maybe next year I could bring a tape. I don't understand. Tell you what, I could arrange a screening. Maybe that would help jog your memory. - So, what do you want? Money? - I want you to turn yourself in. - For what? - For trying to kill Alex tonight. What the hell are you talking about? Why would I hurt her? She won. It's over. You're right. Your motive went away as soon as she won the contest, but who.... What do you say we give her a chance to freshen up before taking any more photos? Your wife. Seriously. My makeup must be a mess. I would stay here if I were you. Unless Miss Fresh Face is okay with having a corpse for a spokesmodel. What? Adrian didn't like that you slept with her husband... so she added a speciaI ingredient to your makeup remover. Something that cIeanses and kiIIs pesky bIackmaiIers. You poisoned my makeup? What better way to kill a beauty queen? You can't prove any of it. Not my department. But as soon as I turn over the evidence... they're gonna have plenty of questions for you. Adrian, I had this handled. What did you do? She made a fool out of you, Julian, and she made a fool out of me. After tonight, her face would have been everywhere... and I couldn't stand the thought of it. Two days! I'll get you everything, plus interest! Sorry, buddy, too late now. Daddy, I was looking all over! Sorry, baby. I just had a little business to attend to. It's too bad about that contest-- - I won! - What? I won! That other girl was blackmailing a judge, so they disqualified her. - Do you mean.... - I'm Miss Fresh Face! Yes! The scholarship, the modeling contracts, the free cosmetics! All mine! I got to go call Mom! Yes. That's just great. I don't know what you did, but I'm impressed. Any time, baby. Any time. - Hey. - Hi. - How'd your date go? - Honestly, not so good. The truth is the whole time I was with Tabitha... I couldn't stop thinking of another girl I knew. Hey, remind me again why we broke up. Because I was unpredictable... and because I ran off in the middle of sentences. Because I kept secrets. - And that bothered me? - It did. Maybe I overreacted. Maybe I could learn to live with those things. No, you didn't. And you couldn't. Because as much as I'd like to, I'll never be able to change. That's who I am. That's who I'll always be. And because of that, I'll have to give up things. Sometimes really great things. I'm sorry, Luc. - Don't be. - No, I'm sorry for me. - Hey, Davis. - Hello. You okay? I will be, I guess. What about you? Did that reporter ever call? No. She came in. Don't worry, I didn't say a thing. Good. It's just been a long day, you know? I don't know if I could handle reading about myself in the morning paper. She does know something, though. Something that I've known for a long time. Not that she'll be able to prove it. Maybe I should've told you sooner... but I didn't want to confuse you even more. - Davis. Before you, there was someone else. A woman. She relived days. She could prevent death. Once you asked me why I believe you... how I readily accept what you can do. And that's why. Because I met her. And as many times as you read her file, it's never gonna be in there.
