Come on, sweetie. Is everything okay? Shh! Stay quiet now, Tru. Are you alone? Yes. Where's your daughter? She's not here. Good. I see Mom's face. And then I hear it. A man's voice and.... It's'cause Daddy's coming to town. - The dream has nothing to do with Dad. - Right. Besides, Meredith says he's only in town for a conference... so the odds are we won't even hear from him. But there's something else. And that is? What I do... going back, trying to save these people from dying... I think Mom could do it, too. Where did you get this? Davis. He was an assistant the night they brought Mom in. How does this freak- fest from a morgue... become such an expert on our mother? He talked to people, did research. Besides, the question isn't how he knows, but if he's right. And if he is... what am I going to find out next? Help me. There's this new technology everybody's talking about. It's called a bed. Sorry. I haven't been sleeping very well lately. Your shift's over. Why don't you go home and get some real rest? How"over"? I'm meeting Harrison and Meredith at the diner in three minutes. Rumor has it our father's in town. This is Meredith's way of dealing. Your father? Yeah. Just because none of us has seen him in five years... doesn't mean he still can't make us crazy. So, you want to talk about our father, right? Actually, I was going to see who wants to split the French toast. Here you go. Expecting someone? Right. About that. Well, you asked if I had anything to say about Dad... and so I brought someone... who I thought could say it better. His wife. Jordan. Well, it ain't breakfast, it's an ambush. Don't blame Mere. This was my idea. Anyway, I'm sure you all remember this weekend is your father's birthday. And since he's in town for a conference... I convinced him to let me throw him a party. - Yeah. - Here in his hometown. And I thought what could be more special for Richard... than to spend his birthday with his kids? - From which marriage? - Harry, she's trying. Why can't you? It's just a small get- together. I work nights. Well, they let you out to eat, don't they? Just come tonight. lsn't showing up the least you can do? Funny, I thought the same thing about my dad my last 10 birthdays. Tru, I'm sorry, that's not-- For what? For breaking up my parents' marriage, or pretending it never happened? You know, I just remembered I got to be somewhere. Tru. You wouldn't believe it, but we get some pretty questionable job applicants. But you, on the other hand... good school, six years of EMT experience. This is pretty good. - Some would say that you're overqualified. - Some might say I'm late paying my rent. Yeah. Look, the reason I'm here is because they say this is a decent place to work... reasonable on- call hours, steady turnover. Well, you have done your homework. I do have some other candidates coming in... - but I'll show you around the place. - Great. So, this is the sign- in room. The hub of most of the activity. Not today, obviously, but.... Right. Do you guys use LFD as your primary filing system? Yeah. Slow week. Probably a good thing in our business. You mind if I take something to drink before I hit the road? - No, not at all. It's right there. - Thanks. Perfect timing. Odd and compIeteIy off scheduIe, but perfect. I forgot these when I took off this morning. This is Mr. Harper. He will be interviewing to replace Gardez. Hey. Jack. Hey. Tru. You had to write it down? Just so the functional illiterate wouldn't drink my soda. Right. Can't be too careful... what with the big soda shortage I've been reading so much about. And here I was thinking you didn't read. Okay, you know what? I'll probably make my decision by this afternoon. Great. Well, you know where to find me. Excuse me. Thanks. That guy's going places. Yeah. Let's just hope somewhere far, far away from here. Are you all right? Fine. I just don't get why you'd want to hire someone like that. I know you have a lot on your mind, but are you sure... that it's Jack that's bothering you? Hey, Claire. It's Tru. - I know who you are. - It's been a while, I wasn't sure. Anyway, I'm looking for Jordan, your mom. She's not here. Do you want to talk to my daddy? - No, that's okay. - Dad. Yeah? Tru. Hi, Dad. It's good to.... I was sure you'd be at your conference. I was actually just looking for Jordan. Claire, do me a favor. Go keep an eye on your brother, will you? Come in. Or are you in a hurry? Jordan's actually running errands. But she'll be at the party tonight. Can it wait until then? I don't know if I'll be able to make it. You know, work. Right. Jordan told me about your breakfast this morning. And it will mean a lot to her that you came here to apologize. Apologize? No. I might have been a little out of line. I was upset. With Jordan or with me? I should go. Come tonight, okay? If I can. Look at you. You are so much like your mother. It was your mother. What you can do, she could do, too. Jordan, it's me again. I don't know if you're still out... or if you even have your cell phone with you. Should I worry? Call me. Thanks. - Thought I'd make an appearance. - I'm glad you did. I can only stay for a minute. Where's Jordan? I'd still like to have that conversation. Running late, as usual. She was supposed to meet me here after her errands. Typical Jordan. I'm sure she's just out getting you a last- minute gift. Yeah. Come on. Look who's here. Come on. Harrison. Hi. I want to introduce you to my lovely girl, Lindsay. - Hi, Mr. Davies. - You're Tru's friend from school, right? Yep. I don't think Harrison has ever formally introduced me to anybody he's seeing. It wasn't really necessary before. - Lindsay, let's go get drinks. - Yeah. It was good to see you again. Seems like a nice girl, Lindsay. - And here it comes. - Don't get defensive. I look at you, and you've got so many options. Why limit yourself? Usually you save the advice for the occasional Christmas card. Don't waste all your good material tonight. What I'm trying to say, if you'll let me finish, is that you're doing fine. Just don't let this thing with Lindsay confine you. You're young. Keep your eyes open... for what might otherwise pass you by. Well, just so you know... it's kind of a now thing. It's no big deal. Good to know where we stand. Hello. Hi. How was the party? A bust. The only reason I went was to apologize to Jordan, who never showed up. Listen, about your mother. - I just wanted to say that-- - It's okay. I think I've had enough big conversations for one day. So how about the new guy? When does he start, Mr. Mooch? He doesn't. I checked his references and.... He didn't check out? No. It turns out that Mr. Harper has a nasty habit... of not showing up for work. Permanently. Until I called, his last three employers had no idea where he was. You're kidding. So it looks like it's just you and me. Who brought this one in? Copland from County. He's helping me until I find a replacement. Must've dropped it off when I was on break. It looks like a mugging. It's multiple stab wounds. Oh, God. Jordan. Dad, I'm.... I know. You probably don't remember this, but when your mother.... This is where we.... We could have her moved somewhere else if it would make it easier. It's my fault. I shouldn't have let her go. There's nothing you could've done. Mugged. God, if I could just have it to do over again. You should talk to them. I will. You know, there are pieces I remember from the night Mom died. Things I wish I didn't. And they don't have to be here. We're ready for you. I'll keep an eye on the little ones. It's all right. I'll do this. You can wait out here. Let Daddy handle it. All right. Now what? I'll take it from here. - You sure you can.... - It's my job. Yours is to be with your children. They're going to need their father. What are you doing? Go home. I'll cover this. I'm serious. No one's giving out extra credit for the bravest girl in the room. Go on. Go home. You cannot save everyone. Go. Victim suffered multiple stab wounds to the upper torso. Tru. What? I didn't say anything to you. Sex: FemaIe. Tru. Stop him. My God, Davis, I'm so sorry. The coffee's just really hot. This is the third time this week you've crashed out during your shift. Why don't you-- Can't. I've told you about my father's wife, Jordan, right? She's in town and sometime today, she's going to be murdered. - One of those days again. - And about the Jack guy... check his references before the interview so you don't get your hopes up. Okay. Where are you going now? Believe it or not, I'm going to spend the day with my stepmother. Tru? Jordan, hi. This is unexpected. She wanted to see us to talk about some things and-- That's funny, because I was just telling someone... how I thought it was time you and I got to know each other better. You were? I would like that, Tru. Which makes what I came to ask you much easier. Your father's birthday is this weekend and I'm throwing a party for him. I'll be there. You said she'd probably walk out on me. I'm thrilled, Tru. Thank you. Excuse me, I'm going to wash up. Okay, what's going on? Those are the first polite words you've ever said to her. I guess we're all full of surprises today. Hey, kids. What's cracking? Jordan came by and told us she's throwing a party for Dad tonight, and Tru-- - Told her off? - Actually, Tru said she'd be there. She was killed? Come on, get out of here. Why else do you think I'd hang out with her? I don't have a choice. She was killed, she asked for my help, the day rewound... and I'm stuck with her for the entire day. We're going to go pick up Dad's cake. I guess we'll see you guys later? Mind if I come along? You know, help with the party planning? Of course. That'd be nice. What do you know? Could you excuse us for just one sec? You can't tell me something like that and just run off to some bakery. - Do you need me to do something? - I don't think so, not yet. But when Dad asks you about Lindsay tonight... tell him how you really feel, not what he wants to hear. You'll be glad you did. Okay? My office. I'll be right back. So, Jordan, where to after this? Back to the hotel or you may be meeting someone else? It depends on how much time I have. What kind of cake do you think he's going to want this year? Honestly, you've got the wrong girl... if you're looking for intimate knowledge of Richard Davies. Then we have something in common. What do you mean by that? Tru, I love your father. And I might even understand him. But that doesn't necessarily mean that I know him. I think that he only ever let one person in completely... and that was your mother. So the rest of us, we just take what we can get. Can I help you? We'll take the big chocolate one. Sure thing. I see the bulk of your work experience has been as an EMT. Why the sudden desire to change teams? The truth is, I think I'd accomplished everything I wanted to in that line of work. I contacted all your previous employers... and they all said the same thing, that you were good at the job... but one day you didn't show up. Just disappeared. Is there anything you want to say about that? A couple of years ago... I died. Excuse me? I was at a scene working on a kid about nine years old. He had a gunshot to the back. We'd just gotten a pulse... and I guess someone didn't want the kid to make it. He started firing. I caught the bullets instead. I remember... it felt like a bee sting on the back of my neck, right here. Three minutes and 28 seconds. That's how long my heart stopped. And then, I came back. And what was that like? You know, they say an experience like that changes you. It should make you want to live every day to the fullest. But for me, it just.... I lost it. I knew something had to give. It just didn't feel right.... It just didn't feel right entrusting lives to my unsteady hands. I thought a change of location would help. It didn't. I'm hoping a change of vocation will. Some would say once you survive something like that... that you were brought back for a reason. I guess we'll see. I love cutting through the park. If it stays like this, it may be nice living here. Are you sure you don't want to just take a cab? I know you have a lot to do today. No, we're just going a few blocks. I just want to let you know I really appreciate you giving me a chance today. You know, your father and I don't fight very often... but when we do, it's usually about his relationship with the three of you. Really? For what it's worth, I think his distance comes from guilt. About how he dealt with what happened. But he's different now. He wants to make things right. He's changed. He's a different man, Tru. Jordan, go! Now we know why we left the city. They can talk all they want about the shrinking crime rate. You know, I think I'm going to lie down a bit, before the party. Close my eyes. Hey. Thank you. Who knows what couId've happened if you hadn't been there? - I'm just glad you're okay. - Thanks. Boy, never a dull moment. If not the little ones, it's Jordan. - Luckily, she's fine. - Luckily, you were with her. She's sweet, Dad. I probably should've noticed that sooner. I'd probably better get going-- It's nice that you stopped blaming her. Blame her? For what? Me and your mother. Look, Dad, I'm glad that I could help Jordan, but now is not the time. No, it's not the time. It's long overdue. Sit down. When I met Jordan, yes, your mother and I were still married. I'm pretty clear on that part. But we had already decided to get a divorce. What? Why didn't I know this before? Because you didn't want to. I loved your mother, Tru, but the fact is... we grew apart. She became distant, unreliable. She'd run off at a moment's notice... at very odd hours, flimsy excuses. It was like she was living some.... Secret life. The truth is, when I met Jordan, I'd been alone for years. But I've said enough. Too much, probably. Today is not a day for living in the past. I'II see you tonight, won't I? It would mean the world to Jordan if you would make an appearance. And it would to me, as well. - Hey, you made it. - I did. - Hi, you look beautiful. - So do you. Please, I stopped looking beautiful two children ago. So, this is Tru. Richard's daughter. The one I told you about. Jordan's been singing your praises all night. So, if you'll excuse us, I have a lot of people I want you to meet. Come here. Harrison. Dad. I want to introduce you to my girl, Lindsay. - Mr. Davies. - Aren't you Tru's friend from school? Yeah. There's Tru. It was nice to see you again. She seems like a nice girl. She is. One of the nicest ones I've met in a long time. That's good to hear. But at your age, Harrison-- Yeah, at my age, you met Mom. Now you wouldn't consider that a mistake, would you? No, absolutely not. Think about it. You have three wonderful kids. If you haven't noticed. Yeah, I see your point. God, you are so unexpected sometimes. Dad? What? - He's here. - Who? What are you talking about? The man from the park who attacked Jordan. He's here. Or at least he was. He's here now? That means it wasn't random. He's looking for her. I'm going to call the police. Don't let Jordan out of your sight. Excuse me. You... what do you want with her? The daughter's always the last to know. Where's your daughter? It was you. You killed my mother. What do you want from us? What's up? Dad said something was going down with Jordan. - He was here. - The man who mugged Jordan is here? - The man who killed Mom. - What? It's the same person. Go find Jordan, make sure she's okay. Harrison, go. Hurry up! You've gone way too far this time. I told you the last time, this is over. You understand? I never want to see you again. Tru! Wait. - Will you give me a chance to explain? - You knew him. This is not what you think. You don't want to know what I think right now. Yeah, I know him. He's an ex- con, and his name is Carl Neesan. - And you know that because? - I was the one who convicted him. I was an ADA 15 years ago. He was a kid up on a murder rap. He said he was innocent, which they all do. The evidence was flimsy, but I was out to impress, so I went after him. And was he guilty? The jury said he was. That was good enough for me. At the sentencing, he swore revenge... and he said if he ever got out, he would make me pay. Why today? Why today, of all days, does he show up? You think this is the first time? This has been going on for years. He shows up, he demands money. He threatens retribution, so I pay him... and he goes away. Until the next time. And today? Today I told him it had to stop. I wasn't going to pay. I never thought that he would follow through with his threat. God, I never wanted to get you involved in this. Not you, not Jordan. And what about Mom? What does your mother have to do with this? He killed her. - He killed Mom. - Why would you say that? I was there. - No, sweetheart-- - I heard his voice. I will never forget that voice. He killed Mom because he was angry with you. He wanted revenge. Tru, no. Don't tell me no, I saw him. I was there, I saw him pull the trigger. That's not what happened. - How can you tell? He said he-- - It's not! You don't think his was the first name I thought of? The police investigated this thoroughly, and said this was not the man. Airtight alibi. "Not your man, Mr. Davies." But I heard his voice. But did you see his face? No. We live with the question long enough, we want an answer. So our mind plays tricks on us and makes us think we've got one. But we don't. - Come on, it's cold. Let's go inside. - No, I can't. I've got to go to work. - Tonight? - They're expecting me. I should go. Happy birthday, Daddy. Don't you think you've been through enough? Why don't you go home and get some sleep? Sleep. That's a novel concept. If Neesan didn't kill my mother, then is it true? What? That her death had something to do with her calling. Despite what you might think... I don't have all the answers. But I'll promise you this, I'll help you find them. Thanks, Davis. But for now, I'm going to take you up on your first offer. I'm going to go home, draw a bath, and try and get some sleep. I guess you didn't hire Jack after all. Actually, I did. I decided to go with my gut. - That's weird. - What's that? Well, yesterday he took my soda. This one with my name on it. And today, it's still here. You know how many ways you can alter fate. Yesterday you met him, today you didn't. It's impossible to predict how that might alter things. Yeah, I guess. Just give him a chance. I think you'll be happy that you did. He's next door. It'll get easier. What's that? This. Doing what we do. All these people. Taken before their time. Sometimes it just doesn't seem fair. Never really thought about it. That's one way to deal, I guess. But if you ever want to talk, sometimes it helps. You know what I think is unfair? When tubes and machines keep people alive. When life is prolonged beyond its usefulness. That's what's unfair. - Yeah, I guess. - I'll be honest with you. For my money... I think that death was one of the fairest things... that ever happened to some of these people. You said you hadn't thought about it. You caught me. Anyway, I just wanted to say welcome. I'm Tru. - Like the name on the soda can. - Yeah, that's right. Jack. And, um... And thanks for making me feel so welcome. It's never easy being the new guy. It feels familiar, doesn't it? - You okay? - Yeah. - Don't move. Stay here. - Dad, no, he'll kill you. He killed Mom. I don't care what the cops say, I swear it's him. I believe you. And that's why this has to end. No, Dad. Lock the door, wait here for me. You're growing a conscience in your old age, Richard? - Who the hell do you think you are? - The man you paid to kill your first wife. - At least, if I remember correctly. - We had a deal. I pay you, you go away. You didn't honor it, so now it ends. Now, I mentioned the letter, right? The letter detailing everything that's sent to your daughter... if I meet an untimely death? Tru, go! Go! Now! When we meet next, there won't be any warning shot... there won't be any chase down an alley. It's just going to be a bullet through your heart. Goodbye, Carl. Did you....Is he....
