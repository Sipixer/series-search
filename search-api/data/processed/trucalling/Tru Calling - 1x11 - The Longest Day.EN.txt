What's up? What the hell is going on? This, guys, is Tru. My kind, caring... and did I mention beautiful sister? Nice to meet you guys. Explain. You know how you and I depend on each other? - Harrison? - The old saying: - "Mi casa es su casa"? - Harrison? How about the Biblical quotation that states: "Let you without sin cast the first-- " Harrison, just tell me what happened. Our landlord. A real stickler for the whole "paying the rent" thing. You got evicted? Which brings us back to <i>"mi casa."</i> What's that water? Yeah, you might not want to.... What is that? Luc just fixed the sink this morning. What did you do? Nothing. Guess you had to be there. Why couldn't you have gone to Lindsay's? Because telling your new girlfriend you've just been evicted... isn't very effective pillow talk. Okay, we're out. - Looks like you need your alone time. - Thanks. Let go, boys. I can take a hint. Zachary. By the way, there's some more beer in the bathtub if you want to.... Yeah, right. Yeah. - Open up the register. - Excuse me? You heard me. Open it up. There's nothing. There's nothing here. The cash went out an hour ago. Then give me what you have. Now! Help me. You don't mind? I am perfectly capable of prepping a body solo. Besides, you don't look so hot. Stay away from the shrimp sandwich at that new deli across the street. Ouch. You know, actually I'm.... If you'll excuse me.... Hey, there. I'm Tru. And you are... ...in the red. How about a name? Help me. Bad dream? Yeah. Bad dream. What am I doing out here? Well, the plan was you, me, wine, and a movie. The reality was you, wine, passed out on the couch. Anyway, sorry if I woke you. I wanted to take care of this. Luc just fixed the sink this morning. What did you do? You're fixing it. Yeah. Like you've been asking me to all week. And she's off. Yeah, I'm meeting Lindsay for breakfast. On a weekday? Doesn't she work? She's taking a sick day. How do you know? You just woke up. 'Cause that's a girl thing. - Aren't you gonna change first? - These clothes are fine. Besides, I'm running late. Okay. All right. Here's the thing. I don't even mind your crazy excuses about where you have to go all the time. What I do mind is that you keep a part of your life hidden from me. No, it's nothing. I'll make it up to you tonight. Just bring coffee. Hey, Tru. HeIIo? Hey, Harrison, it's me. I've got some bad news. Give it to me. You'll be evicted today. Tell me something I don't know. Meredith's in rehab. Why don't you crash at her pIace? Or what about yours? Been there. - Hated that. - A dreaded rewind day. So, what did I do? Poker with the boys, food on my couch, flood in my kitchen. Tru, I am shocked. Shocked. I would never do anything.... Whoa, wait, was I winning? Bye, Harr. I'm kind of in a-- This will take a second. I'm writing this song and I can't get the last lyric. Check this out. I'm Iivin' out Ioud, I'm drivin'right through WiII you meet me there? WiII you be true? Nice little pun there."Tru." That's not what I meant. That's not quite what I'm looking for. More of a.... All right. If the body asked for help, why didn't you come to the morgue first and check? Because he asked before I got anything to go on. No name, no personals. I'm lucky I got the receipt. And you are.... He should be here any minute. You got nothing eIse? BuIIet wound to the chest. Wait, Davis, put the sandwich down. - Why? - Davis, it's a rewind day. You want details, or do you want to trust me? Done. Look, here he comes. I'll call you later. ...in the red. ATM can really ruin your day, huh? Can I just go on through? Thanks. Can I help you? Yes. There's a man who went in before me. Are you a relative? No, but-- Nobody goes there unless they have an appointment. Do you have one? Didn't think so. I have to ask you to take a seat. And I have to ask you to bend the rules. Otherwise you'll have a situation on your hands. I think I already do. All right, yeah. What's up, Harrison? I went over to Meredith's, like you said. So you broke in? I didn't have a key. And nobody told me she installed this insane security system. - So what's the password? - What? Wait! I'm coming! Thanks a lot. Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth. Nearest unit respond immediateIy. The password. What is the stupid password? Sorry, I've got to call you back. What? Fellas. It is so good to see you. Just give me the money. There's nothing here. - Now! - Don't! Oh, my God. Sorry. - Hey. - I didn't mean to.... Can you hear me? God, I'm sorry. Talk to me. Hey. Come on. No. Please, no. Stay with me. No. Is he.... Save me. This can't be happening. Bad dream? More like a recurring nightmare. Sorry if I woke you. I wanted to take care of this. Right. Thanks. Sorry about crashing out last night. I swear I'll make it up to you. And she's off. Where are you going this time? The library. - Doesn't open till 12:00. - Right. I'm going to the university library. For what? For a work thing. Are we playing 20 Questions? No, just two. Look, it's no fun for me either, but I've really got to go. And don't worry about the sink. I don't think it's meant to be fixed. - I can handle it. - I didn't mean.... I know you can. Thank you. Bye. Any time. No, Harr. Mi casa es mi casa. So you're asking me to take up residence in a building... where all my neighbors are dead? Hang out at the morgue until I figure something out. Wait, Iet me guess. Rewind day? You could say that. Twice. - So, what did I do? - Trashed my place... got busted breaking into Meredith's apartment. Impressive. Just go to the morgue. Later. - Hey, Brian. - I'm writing this song. See if you can help me out. Check this out. I'm Iivin' out Ioud, I'm drivin'right through WiII you meet me there? Or are we through? You want me to rhyme"through" with"through"? That's creative. How about.... - It rewound again? - Yes. Well, that's unexpected. I thought I finally understood how this thing works. Someone asks for help, I save them, happily ever after. But this time.... - Someone else died. - Yeah. Because of me. But because of you, someone lived. Yeah, a guy committing a felony. Explain to me how that's fair. Can anybody just ask for help now? Maybe there's a homicidal maniac who needs some assistance? Come on, Tru. I've been through this twice, and each time someone different died. Which one am I supposed to save now? Both. Great. I know where one of them is gonna be in eight minutes. About the sandwich? Right about... now. Aren't you.... Hey, I'm Lauren. I work at the Rose Food Market. Sorry, no. In case you're planning on stopping by... you should know we're closed for inventory today. Doors are locked, the registers are empty. Listen, I don't know you, or the Rose Food Market... and I don't know why I care if you're doing your inventory today. Muscle tone appears slack. Large, fatty liver. Could be cirrhosis. - I thought I had it bad. - What are you doing here? Following orders. Tru told me to crash here. Crash? Yeah. So where's my room? Room? We don't have rooms. We have drawers. Whatever. I'm easy. I haven't seen you since my sister's party. We never really got a chance to chat. About? Hello? We're the only two people who know what she can do. Hey, you ever thought of convincing her to play the ponies? No. I believe her gift provides her with a higher calling. Do you mind? These are sterile. Well, they were sterile. So, rewind day, huh? Multiple rewind day. Multiple? Yeah, she told me. First. You gonna eat this? No, it's good. It's all yours. Thanks. Hey. Can I help you? Yeah. I don't feel very good. I'm sorry. Do you have a doctor or caseworker here? No. Okay, let me just get you set up. Right now, I'm gonna be sick, ma'am. To my stomach. Down the hall, to your right. You should be able to get it more than anybody else. You're telling me you can't help me? Can you get me the medicine? No-- Are you telling me you can't help me? Will you give me the medicine? I can't. That's it? - I don't have any more time. - Mr. Mancuso, wait. Hi, Patricia? Yeah, Stephanie Brandis. Stephanie, it's nice to meet you. Finally we got another caseworker here. Come in. If you're finished in the bathroom, the doctor will see you now. You know what? I'm feeling much better. Hey, a little busy right now. You must get your brother out of here. Ten minutes ago, I found him locked inside a crypt. It's not a good time. He's asking me how much a corpse goes for on the black market. Keep him occupied. I'll be there as soon as I can. Not soon enough. Why don't you ask me for help? Come on. Hook a brother up. Hey, dude? What the hell was in that sandwich? Mr. Mancuso! Mr. Mancuso? Wait! Wait, I'm coming! Thanks a lot. Somebody's robbing that store. Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth. Nearest unit respond immediateIy. - Then give me what you have. Now! - Freeze! Hands in the air! Dear God. Drop your weapon on the floor. - I don't have any. - It's in his left pocket. - Empty it. - This is all a big mistake. My God! I didn't see him. He came out of nowhere. Somebody call an ambulance! 1180, Orange and First. I need an EMS team immediately. Copy that. They're on their way. - Forget the ambulance. - Is he.... Why didn't you listen to me? I told you not to go in there. Please. Help me. You've got to be kidding me. What? You've been trying to get me to fix this sink for weeks. Something tells me it wants to stay broken. Whoa, that's the fastest I've ever seen you get ready. That's the fastest I've ever seen anybody get ready. - Sorry, I've really got to run. - Where? Visiting Meredith. - She wasn't allowed to have visitors. - Only immediate family. If it was something else, you'd tell me, right? Of course. Go crash at Lindsay's. 'Cause telling your girlfriend you've been evicted isn't very effective-- Pillow talk, my ass. Nice language. You having one of those days? More like three of them. Just be a polite guest, she'll understand. Three? Sweet. - Writing a song? - How'd you know? Because you're holding a guitar. I'm sort of in a hurry. Right. Okay. Check this out. I'm Iivin' out Ioud, I'm drivin'right through WiII you meet me there? 'Cause I'm stuck in traffic That doesn't rhyme. Three times? And each day, because of me, someone different dies. It's not your fault. Besides, look at the bright side. What's that? Each day you're getting a little bit more information. Another clue. Now you know the guy in the store didn't have a gun. So he's desperate. I get it. But so am I. I mean, what if this day never stops repeating? If every day I wake up and make the same lame excuse to Luc... and call my brother in a vain attempt to keep him out of trouble... and then my neighbor with his lousy song? I can't keep doing this. Maybe your job isn't as obvious as we thought. What do you mean? Perhaps someone is supposed to die today... and stay that way. I can't deal with this. I am not in the business of deciding who is or isn't supposed to die. - How do you know? - Don't say that. You know what everyone else my age is deciding right now? Grad school, or get a job? Order in, or go out? Do I really need a phone that takes little pictures? People say things happen for a reason. That reason is fate. Fate, by definition, is immutable. - Maybe you're here to make sure that-- - Fate gets its way? How do I know what it wants? It'll tell you, eventually. - And until then? - You've got to trust your instincts. - Back to the ATM? - No. Something went down in the clinic. Whatever it was... that's what made him desperate enough to hold up the store. Hi. I'm Stephanie Brandis, one of your new caseworkers. Hi, Patricia? Yeah, Stephanie Brandis. Of course. Through the door and to the left. Patricia Norris is expecting you. I thought she might be. Thanks. Thank God. I've been asking for a new caseworker for months. Come on in. I already started flipping through some of the files. I'm halfway through the Mancuso case. Awful, isn't it? She is the sweetest child you will ever meet. She? Elizabeth. Her parents tried everything, but with a case like this-- I haven't finished reading the file. Elizabeth has acute viral cardiomyopathy. - She had an echovirus last year. - What's the course of treatment? The doctor has her on a daily antiarrhythmic. But the medicine's just a Band- Aid. Ultimately, she'll need a heart transplant. - Is she on the list? - Yeah, pretty far down. With O- neg patients like her... the chances of a heart becoming available are.... Slim to none. Exactly. Mr. Mancuso lost his job six months ago. - His insurance is on its last leg, so-- - I need to talk to you. Michael. We were just discussing your daughter's case. This is Stephanie Brandis, a new caseworker. Nice to meet you. I need more Amiodarone. We ran out, and Elizabeth's breathing is very heavy today. I went to the pharmacy, but the insurance denied me. You know, they were gonna charge me $500 for two pills? I don't have $500. I'm aware-- I need you to get me that medicine. I promise, I'll pay you back. - Mr. Mancuso, calm down. - She's in pain. I'm not a pharmacist. I'm not authorized to give away medicine. I thought you were supposed to help me. Give us some time. We'll see what we can do. - I don't have any. - Mr. Mancuso.... Mr. Mancuso, wait. I don't have any more time. - I can't imagine it getting worse for him. - I can. Look, I swear to you, I'm Stephanie Brandis... and I have a meeting. Don't make me call security. Michael. I understand your daughter is in trouble, but Patricia can help you. - Wait for her call. - My daughter needs her medicine now. She's not going to get it if you do something stupid. What are you talking about? Don't tell me you're looking for a quick way to get cash... which might include holding up the nearest store you find. Leave me alone. Don't do this. You got any other options? She's 11 years old. The one thing my daughter needs is the thing I can't give her. I look at her friends and I wonder... why their hearts work and hers doesn't. Why she got sick and they didn't. I can't fix her... but I can make her feel better. She needs her medicine. She needs it now. I'll get it for you. Just give me an hour. And no charge, but promise me you won't go into that store. An hour? And your address. 820 South Normandy, Apartment 2. Amiodarone, right? Yeah, 15 milligrams. Got it. Go sit with your daughter. I'll be right there. Thank you. Wait! I'm coming! Thank you. Thank you so much. Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth. Nearest unit respond immediateIy. Go to the pharmacy on the corner and ask for Timothy. If she has shortness of breath, this should work. With acute viral cardiomyopathy, she'll eventually-- I know. Need a transplant. You sure he's gonna give me $500 worth of medication? He owes me. I set up his grandma with a nice coffin last month. It looks like you were wrong. No one had to die today. Not one person. I'm glad I was mistaken. - What's up, Harry? - I took your advice and went to Lindsay's. And you said to be a poIite houseguest. WeII, I tried. But I thought I'd be nice and cook a little something for dinner... and I might have started a small fire. And you're calling me why? On the off chance the day boomerangs again... I need you to say two simple words: takeout. Good luck, Harry. You okay? Kind of not. No. - Word of advice. Stay away from that-- - Shrimp sandwich. Yeah, my bad. I forgot to warn you. I've been kind of busy. Sorry. It's okay. Priorities. Go. Michael, I have the medicine. Is she.... She's gone. I should've been here sooner. The medicine wouldn't have saved her life. Thank you for trying. I'm so sorry. There's a plan for everyone. Oh, come here. She's in a better pIace. We did everything we could. You know we did everything. Please. Help me. Bad dream? I wish. You don't need to bother fixing that. Trust me. - Are you okay? - No. Can I help? No. And she's off. Out of curiosity, where are you rushing off to? I could make up some excuse that you'd see right through... because you know me, and I love that. But for us to work, you need to know everything. For that to happen, you need to wait a little bit longer. Obviously, we have a lot to talk about. But I see you're stressed about something, so let me help with that. You're right. Maybe you could help me with something. Harrison's having a really bad couple of days. And he might come by here. Can you keep him out of trouble? - Okay. - Thank you. - I'll talk to you tonight. - Yeah. We'll see. Tru. I'm Iivin' out Ioud, I'm drivin'right through WiII you meet me there? So we can start anew That's my song. I think we're on the same kind of wavelength here. You want to start a band? You must be so sick of explaining this to me. Each time the day repeats, it gets worse. You should've seen this family. Let me get this straight again. You saved the father. Yeah. So he could watch his daughter die. How is that okay? - Without you, they both would've-- - I know. But I'm still stuck in the same day. What am I doing wrong? Maybe you're doing everything exactly right. Davis, you can theorize all you want. Maybe everything was meant to lead you... directly to this little girl. So I'm supposed to keep Michael away from the store... and get help for his daughter? And don't forget, the help that he thinks she needs is useless. The medicine isn't gonna save her life. I have to get her to the hospital. Davis, the sandwich in the fridge, hand it over. - What? - Now. What am I supposed to eat? Michael. - Who are you? - You don't know me. There's no time to explain, but I'm here to help your daughter. - She has to get to a hospital now. - She's gonna be fine. She's not. Elizabeth's in trouble. - Believe me. - How do you know her name? Same way I know you're about to find out that your balance is - $432.18. - I don't understand. - You'll go to the clinic... to beg for free medicine for Elizabeth, but let me save you some time. Patricia Norris, your caseworker, will be sympathetic... but she's not authorized to give you the meds. What are you talking about? Amiodarone isn't gonna save her life. Her heart is gonna fail today. Is there anything you wouldn't do for your daughter? I'd die for her. Call your wife, and tell her to get Elizabeth to the hospital. Here. Honey, it's me. Is she.... No, the medicine is not gonna help her. Take her to the hospital. Yeah, I'll meet you there. Thank you... whoever you are. I want all your money right now. I don't have a thing. Robbery, corner of CIark and Fourth. Nearest unit respond immediateIy. Come on! Please. He doesn't have anything. - Shut up. - Please. Take my necklace. It's worth a lot. Just don't hurt him. Please, take this. All right. All right, take it off. Come on. - Come on. - I'm trying. No! No! Move it! The necklace, come on. Let's go. Hey, it's okay. 911. What's your emergency? Multiple stab wounds. He's bleeding out. We need another line. Get a 14- gauge and set up the rapid infuser. Send a type and cross match to the blood bank now. On three. One, two, three. - Who the hell are you? - City morgue. Where's my daughter? Damn it. She's in v- fib. Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Get the paddles. No. Everybody clear? Elizabeth. Still no pulse. Start the compressions. Please, no. Oh, God, no. Please try and calm down. Three entry wounds in the right upper quadrant, set up for a DPO. Yes, doctor. Blood in the peritoneum. Where the hell is the trauma surgeon? I'd die for her. I'm not gonna make it. Doctor? Please. Make sure she's okay, please. Pressure's still dropping. Clear. Push more ringers, fast. He needs blood. Where is the O- neg I ordered? On its way. Scalpel. With O- neg patients like Elizabeth... the chances of a heart becoming available are.... Slim to none. You're a mess. His heart was destroyed. But not today. I didn't need to save him, I needed to save his heart. For her. Your daughter's gonna live a long and healthy life. Come on. Push through. Damn it. Time of death, 12:32 p. m. His daughter needs his heart. Notify the transplant team, and get Pediatric Cardiology. I hope you didn't just break that. Because Luc spent two hours trying to fix it. Yeah. I know. Hey, you okay? This has been the longest day of my life. I know the feeling. If it makes you feel any better, I got evicted today. Really? But your boy Luc really saved my ass. He kept your buddies from trashing my place? Yeah, that, and he joined the poker game and then he.... Let's just say that I have enough money for last month's rent. Oh, and next month's, too. But you should get some rest. - I'm out. I'll talk to you tomorrow. - Yeah. I really hope so. Hey. Hi. So you were right. Someone was supposed to die. He just had to die differently so someone else could live. I should've been able to save them both. You can change events, but you can't change fate, Tru. I can do things that probably no one else can.
