to saving lives or not? Yes, I'm committed. Don't you see? I gave you a gift. I gave you the perfect excuse to walk away. Actually, you gave me every reason to stay. You missed quite a day. Jack came back, and my father moved to town. Are you offering me a job? What do you say? Wanna work come for the old man? He does love his sister, and that bond is stronger than you think. So's the bond between father and son. Good people have to die too, Tru. You know that as well as I. You say you're not a killer. What do you call what you're doing? My job. Every cadaver has a story. Treat it with respect... ...and you will be privileged to learn from it. Break into groups. Four to a cadaver. Excuse me. Are you the girl who answered Seidel's trick question and made him look bad? - I don't know if I made him look bad. - Guys, this is her. We want you. How awkward. She means for our lab group. We need a fourth. - And you want me? - Absolutely. You cut Seidel off at the knees, which was so hot. Obviously, you're brilliant, and because you're auditing... ...you're not gonna affect the grade curve. Tyler says that you're the perfect woman. - Jensen. - Tru. You got a really deft hand with that duodenum. I suppose you hear that all the time though. Thanks. Sorry, I work nights. It was a long shift. - Didn't get much sleep. - You must get jaded quickly... ...if you're yawning in a room with dead bodies. - What is with this bag? - What's wrong with the bag? - It's a gift for Lexi. - Jensen looked up from his books... ...Iong enough to get a girlfriend. We were all very relieved. - "Essence of Roses." - Essence of Roses. Avery, what...? What are you doing? I can't put it on myself. What if I don't like it? I don't need you to analyze it. I need you to tell me if it's a gift that says I care about you... ...or that you smell bad. I don't know, it depends on where she sprays it. Nice. Very nice. That's no way to handle a gallbladder, Mr. Lee. - Oh. - Oh. Lexi's perfume. I'm sorry. Hey, smells better than formaldehyde. What is that smell? What smell? It smells like roses and formaldehyde. - So, Harry, what's with the camera? - Oh, it's nothing. Just my first solo gig at Dad's law firm. The training wheels are off, baby. Check it. These two guys got in a fight on a golf course... ...and one of them is filing an A&B. - A&B? - Yeah, assault and battery charge. He claims he was too hurt that he couldn't leave the house. Well, I happen to know that he's a major hockey fan... ...and he's got tickets to tonight's game. So you're gonna be taking shots of him jumping up and high-fiving his friends. And when I lay those pictures down on Dad's desk, he's gonna love me. Love me. I'm glad you are getting along. I know how much that means to you. Yeah, it's great. You know, you two are getting along, right? And... I don't know, maybe we were just too hard on him. Maybe. - Hi, mind if I join you? - Oh, Dr. Allen. - No, go ahead. - Oh, you can sit down. Oh, damn. - I forgot to ask for sugar. - Oh, have one of mine. - Oh, shoot. - Is it all right? Yeah, it's just a little wool-polyester fiber. Mmm. Did you get the memo about the fire drill? - No, I didn't. - Tomorrow afternoon. I like to warn people because sometimes that alarm goes off... ...at the most inconvenient times, when you're in the toilet... ...or you're elbow deep in someone's chest cavity, and... Well, I suppose I should go back across the street. - Okay. - Bye. Bye. Thanks. I'm just cursed. I'm just... I'm sure it wasn't that bad. When the saints were around my cradle, they said: "He will be able to analyze 60 kinds of bullet wounds... ...but when it comes to conversational skills, none." I thought you didn't even like small talk. - I hate small talk. - So then why would it bother you if...? Ah. What was that? What was that "ah"? It's just an "ah," Davis. There's no agenda. Okay. - Harry. - <i>Hey, it's me.</i> - I got those pictures. - Congratulations. Yeah, it came at a price though. The guy's got a mean right hook. - Ouch. - It's worth it. I can't wait to show Dad. I am so happy for you. I'll call you later, okay? - <i>Yeah.</i> - Bye. - Yeah, about the "ah"... - Talk to her again. Find a topic you can both get excited about. I find that my interests don't overlap with the rest of humanity's. Okay. Thomas Burrell, M.D. Looks like a note he scribbled to himself. - What is it, a grocery list? - "Varden"... ...and an arrow pointing to "DSM3." Must be a psychiatrist. - How do you figure? - Well, you see... Please. Help me. That's no way to hold a gallbladder, Mr. Lee. I am so sorry. I'll thank you not to bring your feminine trinkets into the lab, Miss Davies. No. I'm sorry, I'll go tell him it was mine. It's all right, but I have to go. Is it me, or does Tru seem a little abrupt? Help me. - Hey. - Hi. - Is he in? - Yes, go on in. Thanks. I rewound. - Got it. Day two. Cause of death? - Shot in the back at Fourth Street Market. What's your strategy? My daughter is expecting you... ...and her record's been good since Luc, which was a stretch of the rules. I told you. Luc was meant as a lesson. Not a lesson she seems to have learned from. I am not losing this guy to Jack. - You did well against him last time. - <i>That's the point.</i> There's an opportunity here to take things to another level. Learn from the mistake you made with her mother. - Marrying her? - Killing her. We know that won't help. The ability only goes to someone else. No, Tru has to be rendered powerless. And I have an idea on how we can do that. - Who's the victim? - Thomas Burrell, M.D. Must be a psychiatrist. His office is at... ...87 Third Street. - I'm going straight there. Maybe I can head him off before he goes to the market. Hey. I'm sorry to bother you... ...but your receptionist seems to be away. Oh. Um... Well, I'm sure she'll be back in a minute. - Can I help you? - I hope so. L... I've been going through a lot of changes lately... ...and I was thinking maybe it's time to talk to someone about them. - Could you be more specific, Mr...? - Goodwin. - Paul Goodwin. - Dr. Burrell. What do you hope to get out of therapy, Paul? Well, I have a very high-stress job... ...and I wouldn't mind learning some coping skills. May I ask what it is you do? You might say I'm a repo man. People cheat, try to hold on to what's no longer theirs... ...and when that happens, I come and take it back. Well, I can see where that might be stressful. People must get angry with you all the time. They do. They fail to realize that what I do isn't personal. Laws are there for a reason. - Someone has to say no. - Mm-hm. Well, Tuesday at 5 for a beginning? - Great. - Good. Excuse me. I'll be right back. I don't know where Jan's gone. This is Dr. Burrell. May I help you? I see. And who made the referral? Thanks, I'm ready. No. That shouldn't be a problem at all. I'll just lighten my caseload. No, I tell you what. Well, Jan's out of the office right now. When she gets back I'll just get her to move some things around. No. No problem. You're welcome. Hi. You know what, I gotta run. Tuesday at 5, right? - That'll be fine. - Great. I should mention, I've got an ex-girlfriend who's just a little <i>Fatal Attraction</i>. She cornered my last shrink with a lot of questions. Claimed the doctor was in some sort of "danger." She was trying to invade my privacy, you know? No, I promise you, I take doctor-patient confidentiality very seriously. I figured that. Thanks, doc. See you Tuesday. Dr. Burrell. Oh, you're too late. The good doctor just left. How do you know these things? How do you get to a victim before I do? Does Apple tell Microsoft? We're not business rivals. This is about people's lives, Jack. Our business is people's lives, Tru. I'm not gonna stand here arguing with you... ...because I've got a job to do. Love the perfume. See you. - Dr. Burrell. - Yes? I need to talk to you. It's an emergency. - Would you mind coming with me? - Coming where? I can't talk here, but it'll only take a minute. If you wanna talk, make an appointment with my office. No, there isn't time. Dr. Burrell. Dr. Burrell. - Police! - My God! She killed that man! No, I... Hands in the air. You're under arrest. I didn't do it. Someone shot him, and they're getting away. They were arguing. She shot him when he turned. - It did look like that. - I was only talking to him. - Ma'am, your name would be? - Kelly Robson. Tru, what's the deal? I thought you were supposed to be the responsible one. Handcuffs? No problem. I see this all the time. If you're in this predicament again, a good penknife will get you out. I don't usually carry a penknife. Well, any sharp blade will do. How many times have you been in these? You know what? Don't answer that. What's that smell? - Hi. - I'm in trouble. I tried to stop the murder, but things didn't go well. - <i>I need to see you.</i> - I would advise against that. Are there, by any chance, cops there? That would be correct. I'm sorry that we won't be seeing each other today. I got to him too late. Jack was there. He set me up. It all happened so quickly. I was standing there listening to him lie to the police... ...so I got out of Dodge. Sometimes situations like this can have a legal solution. - You want me to turn myself in? - No. I think he wants me to talk to Dad. Well, he's got a point, Tru. Dad's a criminal-defense lawyer. I mean, this is what he does. Okay, message received. I'd better go. Call you later. - Okay. - Who was that? That was my contractor. He's working on my bathroom... ...and he said he'd have it ready today, but... They never show up. - Dad, something happened. - I know. The police were here. Come sit with me. Honey, you're gonna have to tell me everything. - Son, would you mind waiting outside? - No, it's okay. Harrison, please. Sure. Yeah. Outside. Dad, this is all a setup. I didn't do it. You should know that the police have already begun investigating you. They found your name in his appointment book for therapy. - They know you were his patient. - I wasn't his patient. They also found a file with your name on it in his office. I never even met this man before he was killed. A number of witnesses say they saw you having... ...an argument with this man. What was that about? I never had a gun when I was arrested. Does that mean anything? Prosecutions go ahead without the weapon. A place that crowded, people tramping through the crime scene... ...anybody could've kicked it, anyone could've picked it up. The police will not see that as significant because they have a witness. This witness is the man that framed me. His name is Jack Harper. He's looking for a way to bring me down. Why would he wanna do that? Because we have this past, Dad. It's complicated. Dad, why did you ask Harrison to step outside? Because I thought you might have something to tell me... ...that you wouldn't want him to hear. I have to go. Tru. - He thinks I'm guilty. - No. You just misunderstood him. Harry, he believes that I killed someone, that I'm a murderer. He must've had his mind made up before I got there. I was stupid to expect that just because he's my father... I'm on my own in this. No. Look, you are not on your own, okay? You got me. I'm not some hotshot lawyer, okay? But I know people. I know a guy who can get us some fake IDs, passports. We can go to Mexico, Thailand. Really. I'll find a job. You could look for an opening at a morgue. There's dead people all over the world, right? I don't think it'll work, but thank you. Come on, let's go. - Good job. - It is the humanitarian approach. What harm could she do behind bars for the next 50 years? Okay, so she could save a few felons, I'll give her that. Did you know that when the guillotine was invented... ...the idea came from a physician? Dr. Guillotin. He thought that was humanitarian too. Well, it was quick. You sure you can talk? - You okay? - Usually, if the day were this bad... ...I'd do it over, except I'm doing it over already. Burrell's body got here a half-hour ago. Okay, you'll find a piece of paper on the body. And there's a note scribbled. "Varden" and "DSM3." You knew he was a psychiatrist from what you found on the body. - How's that possible? - It must be the DSM3. That's the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical</i> Manual of Disorders. It's kind of the bible of psychiatric diagnosis. It's weird, though, because the third edition was replaced by number four... ...back in the '90s. Is any of this helping you, or...? I wish I could say it was. Because I have this crazy idea, I guess. Right now, I'm so open. Well, if you can get in contact with Burrell's body... ...he might ask for help again. And that way your day could restart, and you can get yourself... ...out of this mess. It's a long shot, but it may be the only shot we have. The problem is that there's still way too many police here. If I can't get to the body, maybe you could bring it to me. Well, I find that cadavers tend to get noticed in public. I know one place where they're old news. The anatomy lab on campus. It should be empty right now. - <i>I'll meet you there</i>. - Okay. Yeah, and fleeing to Thailand was a crazy idea. Look, I can do this on my own, but they'll be searching for my car. Lend me yours? I'm driving. Hey. So some alone time with Mr. Gorenstein? Yeah, I'm just reviewing this morning's work. What about you? - Me? Same thing. - Well, pull up a stool. Wouldn't you rather pull up a stool at the coffee shop, say? - Are you asking me out for coffee? - No, I'm just confused is all. I mean, you seem like the last person in our class who'd need to review. I mean, you're brilliant. You graduated college early, masters in chemistry. Teachers are already impressed with you, so take a break. Did Avery tell you that in the two minutes it took me... ...to get sponges this morning? - Maybe. - Yeah. It's not the professors I really need to convince. Heard of the Bettendorf Clinic? Right up there with Mayo and Johns Hopkins. My dad's kind of their poster child. Some people say he's the top diagnostician in the country. - Hard to live up to. - Yeah. No, besides from the inhumanly high standards... ...he's kind of like Martha Stewart, you know? And I just keep folding the napkins wrong. I know what you mean. Yeah, I never know what my dad's gonna be. Which is why there's no point in being here on a nice day... ...trying to impress these guys. Um... Tru? Look, I'm in trouble, and I can't explain why... ...but I need you to trust me. Don't tell anyone I'm here. What are you doing? Tru? Tru, is there something I should know here? Tru? I'm Officer Gomez. Maybe you can help me. I'm looking for a Tru Davies. I understand Miss Davies audits class in here? Yeah, in the morning she does, but it's over now. - So you're acquainted with her? - Yeah, she's a medical student. She's in my anatomy class. What can you tell me? Um... May I ask why it is that you're looking for her? She's wanted for questioning in regard to a murder. Oh, so you're looking for her as a witness? We'd just like to speak with her. What's that smell? Oh, that's perfume. I dropped a bottle. It was a gift for my girlfriend. - What do you think? - I think it's a little strong. Why should I have to fork over my hard-earned taxes? Excuse me? Hey, can I help you? You mind if we check that? Wait right here. Gomez here. He did? No. I wanna question him myself. Make sure he doesn't leave. I have to go. Here's my card. You can reach me at that number any time. Was there something you wanted to tell me? Just if I hear anything, I'll call you. Tru, what the hell is going on? Thank you. Just thank you. You did the right thing. Hopefully, I'll be able to explain this to you someday... ...or that I won't have to. Tru, what are you...? Thanks, officer. Mr. Davis. It's actually just Davis. Why don't we have a little chat. Tru. Tru, you gotta get back to the car. The cops are looking for you. You can't stay in one place too long. Where the hell's Davis? He didn't show up with the body... ...and he's not answering the phone. May I? Davis, what's going on? It's Detective Gomez, Miss Davies. Guess what. You're number one on your boss 's speed dial. You need to think about turning yourself in. You're an intelligent woman. You're only getting yourself deeper in trouble. - And now your friends too. - Triangulating. Detective, I didn't kill that man. Hang up the phone. - That man was a good human being. - Tru. I was meeting him because he told me about you. - What? - He wanted to discuss a patient. I was never his patient. Tru, they can trace the call. It's down to a 12-block radius. Your name was in his book, you were seen with him... ...and you wanna tell me you didn't know him? Do yourself a favor and surrender. Let your lawyer do the talking. Give me that. Look, you keep this. I got a work phone in the car. - What are you gonna do with mine? - I'm gonna drive away... ...make a call and throw it in a truck. If there's one thing I know, it's sneaky. What about you? Davis got busted so there's no rewind. All I've got is a note from the doctor. Varden and DSM3. - So? - Okay. Can you do one more sneaky thing for me before you go? I need you to steal a book from the medical library. No problem. Stay here, keep an eye on our friend. Watch in case Miss Davies returns. You never know. Detective, as I've told you, I was taking Dr. Burrell's body to the security crypt. Generally, that is where we keep high-profile cases. I thought it was a good idea at the time... ...because the suspect was a morgue employee. And, yes, Miss Davies is on my speed dial. But so is Funky Chicken and Charmed Pizza... ...as well as three other morgue workers. Now, you've got your body. I have a morgue to run. Excuse me. Thank you so much, Harry. I really appreciate it. And a little bonus for you. Tru, you watch yourself. They're handing these out to everyone who passes the Union, okay? Thanks. Hi. Do you mind if I join you? No, go right ahead. Oh, damn. I forgot to ask for sugar. I wanted to discuss patient-therapist confidentiality. Oh. Davis, as a psychologist, I'm employed by the city... ...but I respect anything you might have shared during your evaluation. Oh, I'm being hypothetical. I'm writing a book. Are you really? Wow. Hands-on professional and a man of words, all in one package. Tell me you can do laundry and we'll run away together. Under what circumstances is it ethical to discuss a patient with the police? The laws vary from state to state... ...but basically, when there's immediate threat. Knowledge of a past crime wouldn't be enough? Only if it contributes to your belief that there's a threat. And past crime can help predict future behavior. You are a man of many surprises, Davis. - What's the book about? - Hmm? - Hello? - It's me. Harrison gave me your number. He said something about putting your phone in the back of a truck? Oh, God, Davis, it's so good to hear your voice. Are you all right? I'm fine, don't worry about me. Did you find anything about the note? No. And the word's spreading. I don't know how much time I have left. We still don't know what Varden means. But if it is the killer's name, and he is a patient... ... he probably will be in Burrell's files. I thought of that. But breaking into the man's office? That's risky, and the police could still be there. And if Varden's not in the files, then it was all for nothing. Not necessarily. I've been speaking with Carrie. Search for someone the doctor would assume... ... would present a danger. Someone with a violent background. I can't sit there all night going through files. - You're right. - We'll hope the right one is near the top. There's one more thing. Unless you have a background as a jewel thief... ...I don't know about, I don't see you just waltzing into a locked office. Does the morgue still have Burrell's personal effects? - I see where you're going with this. - Talk to you later. I'll be right there. Hey. Messenger. - Package going to County Records? - Make sure it gets there quickly. Trust me, I got it. You really came through today, Harry. I'm good with emergencies. It's that day-to-day stuff I can't hack. Yesterday you were at a hockey game right now... ...taking those pictures you wanted for Dad. I'm sorry. This is more important. We stick together, sis. And that way, Dad can be disappointed in both of us. Okay. Well, just get out of here. I got my work phone. If any cops even think about showing up, I'll call you. Tru? Tru? Harrison. Varden. Varden. "Donald Stuart Mitchell III." DSM3. "Violent tendencies. Narcissistic personality. Sense of entitlement. Possible involvement... ...in the disappearance of girlfriend, Grace Varden." Looks like my tip was right. Detective, listen to me. I'm holding the killer's file in my hands right now. Donald Stuart Mitchell. He's the patient Dr. Burrell wanted to talk to you about. He must've found out what the doctor was gonna do. Oh, my God. If he was at the market early enough and saw you two talking... ...he'll wanna kill you too. Put the folder down. You're not doing yourself any good. Listen to me. He'll wanna kill you too... ...if he thinks you know he killed Grace Varden. Grace Varden? Thanks. I think that file's mine. - Relax, I'm not gonna kill you. - No. Because the police would only look for another shooter. This way I'm the end of the trail. I go to prison for two murders. - And one a cop-killing. - I'll tell them the truth. Feel free to tell them whatever you want. Because without this file, it becomes a story you made up. It's too bad the circumstances aren't a little different. Because you are a lot prettier than Grace was. Jack. He decked me. Sorry, Harry. There's nothing left to do. Help me. That's no way to handle a gallbladder, Mr. Lee. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Really. But I really have to go. Why are you taking that? I don't have a penknife. Is it me, or does Tru seem a little abrupt? - Day three? - And two lives to save. What I can find is that Grace was a coed... ...who disappeared three years ago. The cops think she was a murder victim. But there's no evidence of what became of her. They never found her body. And her family is devastated, but they have no idea what happened to her. I have to make another call. Are you clear on what I need you to do? - Got it. - Okay. Hey, sis. I'm on my first solo gig for Dad. No time. It's a rewind day. Listen. Yesterday, I was arrested for murder. You got decked by Jack. - I was what? - <i>Never mind.</i> Today, I'm gonna do things differently. Jack's gonna do things differently too. He'll throw a curve ball where we least expect it. Here's what I need you to do. Dr. Burrell. You're here to meet Detective Gomez. Yes. Couldn't she make it? Are you with the police? You're in immediate danger from one of your patients. Donald Stuart Mitchell. We think he's here. If you'll go with this man, he'll take you somewhere safe. Thank you. That was for yesterday. I think. Harrison, Harrison, get out of the way. Your sister's in danger. Whoa. Right. Coming from you? I don't think so. You got two targets today. You're trying to make sure that cop dies. The killer thinks your sister is the cop. Don't you see? He saw her talking to the doctor. Your sister is the target. - Wouldn't that make you happy? - No. Tru didn't die yesterday. She's not supposed to die today. Whatever you think of me, I don't care. But do you wanna take a chance with your sister's life? - What are you doing? - I'm saving your life. Officer! Help! Police. Nobody move. - Jack. - Watch this. The detective's all mine. Hey, that's Detective Gomez. She's the one you want. Drop it. You're under arrest for the murder of Grace Varden. I have a feeling Grace Varden's family will finally be getting some closure. Thank you. Bye. Well, it's been... Well, it's been confusing as usual. I gotta get out of here. I got a job to do. Those incriminating photos don't take themselves. Enjoy the hockey game. And watch out for a sudden right hook. I never thought I'd know anybody that was on the lam. Yeah, it's more fun in the movies... ...when you're with Cary Grant or Matt Damon. Yeah. Well, you just had Harrison and me. Oh, Davis, please. You guys were the best accomplices a girl could want. - Hey, Davis. - Oh, hi. I'm so absent-minded, I was in the elevator when I realized I forgot sugar. Oh, here. - Thanks. - Sure. - Hi. Tru. - Hi. Carrie. I've seen you around. So seen any good cadavers lately? Uh... Yeah, actually I have. This guy came in and his entire intestinal system was... - It was orange. - She was kidding. I... I was too. It's, like... ...joking around and stuff. - I should get back. Bye. - See you. - Bye. - Enjoy the sugar. Enjoy the sugar. God. My complete ineptitude. Jeez. - You like her. - No, I don't. Yeah, maybe. I don't know. - Is there a day one for this? - Didn't go well. - Day two? - Don't know. I was too busy to talk. It probably didn't go very well. There's some kind of weird connection I have, though. I'm probably full of myself. Well, as a henchman in my underworld gang... ...you were the best. I don't know what happened to etiquette. It's been a week. You don't call, you don't write. Don't people still say thanks when someone saves their lives? I would thank you if you hadn't been setting up Detective Gomez... ...to die at the same time. Then there's that "framing for murder" part. You take things too personally, Tru. A word of advice: This med school thing is a nice dream. But you can't have both worlds. As long as you do what you do, you don't belong in there. My advice to you: Work on being a gracious loser. Tru can tell you I was right about the metatarsals. - You're not. - She's right about the metatarsals. It's gonna be like that for the rest of the year?
