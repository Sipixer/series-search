Prom is coming up. -ls it? -Yeah, and you know l wanted to.... Ronny, anything you want to tell me... or ask me, you go right ahead. Candace, not now. l'll call you later, okay? l'm really sorry, Tru, but this can't wait. What he's trying to say is that he wants to go to the prom with me. What? Candace, how could you do this to me? We're best friends. Tru, high school's nearly over, and everyone knows... that high school friendships don't last. So why would l let a friendship... that's probably going to end anyway, get in the way of something l want? Try not to take it so hard. Things change. See you. [Somber instrumental music] [Soft, rhythmic instrumental music] Thank God. Did you nod off? What's this? ''High school reunion.'' You going to this? Go back to high school? Absolutely... not. [Theme music] Help me. LlNDSAY: l can't believe you. How many times will you say you're not coming to the reunion tonight? LlNDSAY: lt'll be fun. TRU: Lindsay. Okay, for the last time, you are coming, even if l have to drag you there myself. You can try, but l'm warning you. My girl's stubborn. Come on. l'm going. -Harrison, you weren't even in our class. -l was two years behind. And Lindsay's taking me as her date. Good. Go. Have fun, and you can tell me all about it tomorrow. ls she okay? Guess l'll go find out. So, just out of curiosity, did you have friends in our class? Well, not five years ago. But now l have you. Did l miss something back there? l just don't want to go to my high school reunion is all. -That bad? -Parts of it. Parts of it were great. l'm just not so keen on reliving it. Look, l didn't know you back then. l'm not even sure l know you now. But you got a lot to be proud of, Tru. Good friends. A cool, if slightly morbid, new job. LUC: Med school's not that far away. TRU: No, l know, it's just-- LUC: Plus... you got a cool new boyfriend you can take to the reunion and show off. -Really? -Yeah. [Upbeat instrumental music] l'm so glad you decided to come. Okay, what do you think? Too much cleavage? Shame on you. No such thing. You know what you should wear? Those pinstriped pants you got downtown. Definitely. You know what? Meredith borrowed them two months ago... and left them at the dry cleaners. All she left me was this ticket. -How is Meredith, anyway? -Good. Rehab is going well. -She'll be home in a few weeks. -Good. Don't worry. l'll pick something out for you. Here, start with these. We'll build around. Hey, do you remember Craig Burg? -Soccer goalie, total hottie. Sure. -l had the hugest crush on him. Yeah. You left him that note. Yeah. l told him everything about how l felt... put it in his locker, waited for him to do something. -And what did he do? -Nothing. He just never even responded. God, l think about that all the time. You think he'll be there tonight? -One way to find out. -Yes. [Upbeat instrumental music] My God, back in high school. Just for a few hours. Just breathe. Stay strong. Come on, let's check out some snacks. Okay, l'll find you later. Just remember, breathe. [Rock music playing on stereo] CANDACE: Billy? Hi. That's a nice tie. l didn't know people were still wearing those... in this century. -Who's that? -Candace Aimes. -You know her? -We used to be best friends. -Tru Davies. lt's me. -Billy. Billy Lambert. My God, you look great. l almost didn't recognize you. Not that you didn't look great back in high school. Who are you kidding? l was a pizza-faced beanpole. -But that was then, right? -What's been going on with you, Billy? l've developed this software that's gonna revolutionize downloading. lt'll make the MP3 player obsolete. That's great. l'll see you inside, okay? Bye. [Lively dance music playing on stereo] So how you holding up so far? Glad you came? My God, it's you! Judy Rogers. Judy, of course. How can l forget? This is my boyfriend. Can you believe it? Everyone here in one room. lt's like we never left. Don't you love reunion directories? You can keep tabs on everyone. Of course, they don't tell the whole story. Like Larry Cutler, addicted to prescription painkillers. TRU: Judy, this is-- JUD Y: And Kenny Lewis is gay. Heard about Steve Sabitzsky? He went into his father's carpet business and fired his own dad. TRU: Judy was-- JUD Y: And Gillian Kaye? You noticed? Less nose, more boobs. All bought and paid for. Judy was the captain of the swim team. JUD Y: He's adorable. Well, honey, you traded up. That Ronny Clifton, you heard about him and Candace? She thinks she's everything 'cause she was Prom Queen. l had the swim team. Candace couldn't swim. l see someone l have to talk to. But this has been great. JUD Y: Right. LUC: Nice to meet you. [Upbeat dance music playing on stereo] Craig. Hey, Glenn Carpenter. Can l talk to you for a sec? Later. Yeah, sure. Craig Burg. Hey. This is gonna sound a little strange, but toward the end of senior year... l left a note in your locker... and l wrote down how l felt about you... in detail, embarrassing detail, actually. And l never got an answer and l was just wondering, you know? l never got any note. l'm sorry, what was your name again? Excuse me for a second. CRAlG: Hey, what's up, dude? MAN: Hey, big guy. [Sad instrumental music] Voting for tonight's Reunion Queen. Want to cast your vote? Yeah. One for Lindsay. TRU: Thanks. So what exactly was the deal with you and this Ronny guy? High school crush gone awry. But you can ask him yourself. There he is. l tell you what. l think l'm going to go get you a refill instead. [Upbeat dance music continues playing on stereo] Tru. Hi, Ronny. God, it's been a while. Last time l saw you, it was right around prom time. l know it's about five years too late, but l owe you an apology. RONNY: l never meant to hurt you, Tru. Candace just got what she wanted. You know, she always did. -Always will. -You don't sound too happy about it. Me? No, l'm good. l'm real good. Life couldn't be any better right now. Hmm. Well, it was real nice seeing you, Ronny. RONNY: See you, Tru. What's the matter? You looking for someone? No, nobody. Well, let's go dance or something. No, thanks. l'm not really for the dancing thing. Okay. Well, do you want to go get a drink then? Hello? Earth to Harrison. LlNDSAY: What do you want to do? HARRlSON: l'll be right back. [Lively dance music playing on stereo] [Exclaims] LUC: Who's that? Mr. Connor. He is the best teacher l ever had. He was the first one who really got through to me. Made me think for myself. He changed my life. LUC: So go say hi to him. TRU: lt's not that easy. Look who he's with. Candace. LUC: Time to let bygones be bygones, Tru. Mr. Connor, hi. Tru Davies. l was hoping you'd be here tonight. I'm so gIad you came. -Tru. -Candace. You look great. l could never get away with an outfit like that. You are so brave. -Thanks. -ls this your boyfriend? We'll give you a chance to catch up with Mr. Connor. Couldn't deny you that. Come on, l'll buy you a drink. LUC: l think they're free. Mr. Connor, how are things? How's the writing? l remember how you were always gonna write the great American novel. CONNOR: Actually, Tru, the writing is going surprisingly well. l am working on something that l feel so good about. Great. That's great. Still thinking about Candace. l guess some things haven't changed that much in the last five years. How's it going, man? Grab one of these? BARTENDER: Sure. KElTH: Thank you. HARRlSON: Keith. KElTH: Hey. -Keith Morgan! -Hey, what's up, man? -You don't remember me, do you? -l'm sorry. l can't say that l do. Well, l'll tell you what. How about l remind you? All right. HeIIo, can I have your attention, pIease? We've counted aII the baIIots, and it is now time to announce... our CIass of '99 Five Year Reunion Queen. Tonight our Queen is Candace Aimes. [Crowd cheering] Do you know that Craig never even got my note? He doesn't even remember me. Ouch! So much for high school memories. Can you believe this? l can't. lt's like a nightmare. The recurring kind. CANDACE: Wow! CANDACE: <i>Thank you so much.</i> This is such a surprise. Okay, not that much of a surprise. Anyway, it's so good seeing you aII here. Some of whom I actuaIIy even remember. CANDACE: <i>This has been--</i> KElTH: l told you l don't know who you are! -Harrison? Jeez! Are you okay? -Okay? l'm great. l've waited years to punch this son of a bitch. Now l remember. You're that guy whose ass l used to kick. ls this what you came here for tonight? Settle some stupid high school grudge? Yeah. l mean, no. l came for you. You're unbelievable, Harrison. LUC: He'll be fine. But are you all right? Yeah. Great. Convincing. But it kind of looks to me like you got Candace on the brain. Hey, if you two really were best friends, now's a good time to go talk to her. LUC: Put things to rest. -Did you see where Candace went? -l saw her heading to the pool. TRU: Thanks. [Suspenseful instrumental music] Candace, are you in here? Oh, no. -My God! Candace? -Save me. [Dramatic instrumental music] Did you nod off? What's this? ''High school reunion.'' Cool. You going to this? Yes, l am. Again. [Dramatic instrumental music] Again? You're going to your high school reunion again? DAVlS: So does this mean-- TRU: My day is repeating itself. -Who's the lucky victim today? -Candace Aimes, high school classmate. -A friend of yours? -lt's complicated. Let's just say l doubt she'll really appreciate any of my help. But she drowned at the reunion yesterday. Drowned. Was there fluid in her lungs? TRU: l don't know. The day rewound before l had a chance to examine anything. -So really l've got nothing to go on. -What about foam? Drowning victims are often identified by a physical reaction known as foam film. When the body goes into rapid shock, then responds... with the formation of mucus around the throat and windpipe? No. Totally clean. lt sounds like you have a murder to solve. You think someone murdered Candace outside the pool... then dumped her in it to make it look like a drowning? lt's a theory. Okay, l got to run. But stay close. l may need you tonight. l'm so excited. l knew you'd come to the reunion. Wouldn't miss it. l was thinking, let's just you and me go together. You didn't want to go, did you? And miss another round of high school? l'll survive. Well, l'm going. -You weren't in our class, Harry. -l've promised him. Yeah, but you'd have so much more fun without him. Trust me. You understand, don't you? We'll catch a movie or something tomorrow night. No. But l was so looking forward to this. Hey, count your blessings, Harrison. High school sucked. Hey, can l talk to you a sec? What are you doing? This is my big date with Lindsay. Liar. You just want to go so you can pick a fight with Keith Morgan. HARRlSON: What are you talking about? There is.... We already went to the reunion, didn't we? Consider it a heads up. You know how annoying it is to have a sibling with your powers? You're welcome. [Serious instrumental music] -Tru. -Hey. What a surprise. What are you.... How did you know where l live? You were listed in the Reunion Directory. Which hasn't come out yet, but l'm on the committee... and l helped put it together. Nice building. lt'll do. For now. l don't mean to be blunt, but what brings you here? Candace, you remember when we used to be friends? -One reunion and everyone gets weepy. -Come on. We used to ditch classes together and talk on the phone all the time. -We were kind of tight. -l know. But l'm through with the past. Because as good as things are for me now, they're about to get a whole lot better. -Really? How so? -l wrote a novel. lt's called <i>High SchooI ConfidentiaI.</i> lt's all about life in high school. No one's seen it yet, but when they do... it's going to be this generation's <i>Less Than Zero.</i> Wow, that's great. l'm so happy for you. So please don't take this the wrong way... but you can't go to the reunion tonight, Candace. l see. You still have that jealousy problem. ls that why you came here? To keep me away so l can't outshine you again? No. lt's just, reunions can get kind of crazy... and who knows what could happen tonight? l know exactly what will happen. You'll show up with Linda, or Lindy-- Lindsay. And you'll be wearing something she picked out for you. l'm thinking two-year-old black skirt, faux vintage top. Thanks for stopping by, Tru. lt's really nice catching up with you. [Serious instrumental music continues] But l wouldn't miss that reunion tonight for the world. LlNDSAY: What's the matter? You seem so tense. Got the pre-reunion jitters? l just keep thinking about Candace Aimes. Can you think of anyone who would still be holding a grudge against her? Strange question. Let me think. -l know. The entire graduating class? -Not high school. l mean now, today. Who would still have issues with her? Ronny Clifton might still be upset with her after what she did to him. TRU: Why, what did she do to him? LlNDSAY: You never heard? After Candace stole Ronny from you, they got engaged... and then she left him at the altar, broke his heart. -Really? -Yeah. l guess no one told you because, well, you know.... [Knocking at door] Finally. My pants. -Hi. l have a delivery for-- -Billy! Tru! This is.... l haven't seen you for what? Like five years. -Yeah. -ls this for you? -Under my sister's name, yeah. -$<i>8</i>. -Are you going to the thing tonight? -Wouldn't miss it. You know my favorite part about these reunions... is listening to everyone out-BS-ing each other... and trying to make themselves sound big and important. Right. l'll see you tonight, Tru. [Upbeat instrumental music] [Upbeat instrumental music] CANDACE: Billy, hi. That's a nice tie. l didn't know people were still wearing those... in this century. BlLLY: She'll always think l'm a geek. You know, l shouldn't be telling you this... but l've developed this software that's going to revolutionize downloading. lt'll make MP3 players obsolete. Tru! TRU: Hey Billy. [Lively dance music playing on stereo] JUD Y: Tru! My God, it's you! TRU: Hello, Judy! Can you believe it? Everyone here in one room. lt's like we never left. -Have you seen Larry Cutler yet? -Addicted-to-painkillers Larry? Yeah. -And Kenny Lewis-- -Gay. -And did you hear about Steve Sabitzsky? -Fired his dad. JUD Y: How about-- Gillian Kaye, with all that plastic surgery? And did you know Candace Aimes could never even swim? lt's been so great catching up with you, Judy. Ronny, hi. -Tru. Hey. You look great. -Thanks. -lt's weird, all of us being back here. -Yeah, no kidding. You okay seeing Candace again? lt didn't work out. Let's leave it at that. She really hurt you. No one can blame you if you wanted her to hurt, too. Slow down, okay? l mean, what happened with Candace and me... yeah, it hurt. But it's history. Water under the bridge. She really broke your heart. People say l broke your heart. lt doesn't make you want to hurt me, does it? [Lively dance music continues playing on stereo] Craig. Hey, it's Tru Davies. Listen, my best friend, Lindsay, is a really good person. CRAlG: Awesome. TRU: l know you don't remember her... but in high school she put a note in your locker and you never got it. l don't know why. But just do me a favor. lf she brings it up tonight, just be nice to her. Could you do that for me? CRAlG: l guess l can. Hey, Tru, you got a minute? l want you to know something. l'm not some total loser who works at a dry cleaners'. -Look, l didn't say anything. -l know. You see, l would have done everything that l said. See, l had all this venture capital lined up. lt was cool until the guy pulled the plug at the last minute. And then, no more capital to venture with. l'm sorry. Whoever the guy was, l'm sure he made a huge mistake. You know who the guy was? Candace's dad. -Really? -Yeah. Nice, huh? [Suspenseful instrumental music] Beer, please. You made it. l didn't think you'd show. lt's not like we got anything else going on. Yeah. Thanks to my sister. You really wanted to go to that reunion, didn't you? You want to know why? -Lindsay. -No. [Upbeat rock music playing on stereo] Keith Morgan. See, this guy used to torture me. lt started out with little swirlies after gym class. And then it was beatings on a semi-regular basis. And now he's back in town. -You wanted to go tonight so you can get-- -Two words: re-venge. They asked me to transfer to another school... -but l figured that l could do more work-- -Do you mind if l cut in? CONNOR: Tru Davies. What a treat. Hi, Tru. Great seeing you. Did you come here stag tonight? No boyfriend? lt's a nice outfit. Somehow not what l expected. -Do you mind if l talk to you for a second? -About what? Why you didn't want me coming? Tru tried to convince me that l shouldn't show... but l told her, high school's over. She can relax. Look, there's Larry Whitesman. l have to tell him how good he looks with the extra weight. -Don't let Candace get to you, Tru. -She doesn't. How come you can't take your eyes off of her? CONNOR: How about a dance for an old teacher? [Upbeat dance music playing on stereo] CONNOR: Look, maybe it's Candace, or maybe it's just being back here... but l can tell there's something on your mind... and l just want to say that even though you've graduated... my office door is still always open to you. l appreciate it, Mr. Connor. [Suspenseful instrumental music] CONNOR: Tru, is there something wrong? TRU: Not if l can help it. [Tense instrumental music] [Dramatic instrumental music] [Tense instrumental music] Candace, are you in here? Candace, watch out! [Tense instrumental music continues] -Dude, this was priceless. -l've been waiting five years for this. Come on, get right in there. -Tru, what are you doing? -She can't swim. [Candace coughing] -You could've killed her. -lt was just a prank, okay? Yeah, we thought you hated Candace more than anyone. You okay? l think you swallowed some water, but you'll be all right. -Hey! What the hell is going on here? -Nothing, Curtis. l mean, Mr. Connor. RONNY: Yeah, we're just having some fun. CONNOR: Very mature, guys. Laugh it up, both of you. They told me to meet them here. See how funny you think assault charges are. You're both witnesses. Candace, are you okay? Back off, Tru. lt's not like you saved my life or anything. [Somber instrumental music] All right, guys, back inside. Let's go! CONNOR: There's some dryers in the locker room. You might want to use them. [Tense instrumental music] lt's too early. DAVlS: Morgue. TRU: <i>Davis, it's me.</i> Hey, Tru. How's the reunion? Everyone still alive? The good news is, l saved Candace after she got shoved in the pool. DAVlS: What's the bad news? TRU: <i>It was just a prank.</i> Which means her life is still in danger and the murder's still on track. Well, maybe the pool prank killed Candace on day one. That's impossible. The times don't match. Candace wasn't in the gym until <i>9</i>:30 and l found her at 10:00. DAVlS: <i>Something must have changed.</i> What did you do differently tonight than last night? Luc! Candace was talking to him yesterday... and so she couldn't get to the pool. But he didn't come with me tonight. That's it. So your invoIvement in events can change them. Last night you saved Candace from humiliation. Tonight you have to stop her murder. Unfortunately, you're back to square one on suspects. TRU: <i>Looks Iike it.</i> Stay in touch, okay? l might need you. This isn't over. God, and l was just a little runt back then. And this dude put me through a living hell. For years! And l have been waiting since the 10th grade to return the favor. Tonight was going to be the night, man. But no! My sis has got to convince Lindsay to leave me at home. Look, l'm sure she had a good reason. Yeah, when you can do what Tru does, you always have a good reason, right? What do you mean? What can your sister do? Well, you know.... She's always looking after little brother. [Upbeat rock music playing on stereo] lt's too bad we can't just crash the reunion. That'd solve everything. BOTH: Let's crash. [Upbeat dance music playing on stereo] Craig. Hey, Glenn Carpenter. Can l talk to you for a sec? Later. Yeah, sure. Craig Burg. Hi, Lindsay. You remembered. This may sound a little strange, but toward the end of senior year... -l left you a note in your locker, and-- -l never got it. But let me tell you something. lf l had gotten a note from you.... lf a girl as beautiful and charming as you had given me one... -l'd be touched. -You would? Without a doubt. And l would have done something about it, too. Who knows where it could've led? But as it is, l'm married. -Congratulations, Craig. That's great. -Yeah, l think so. But l'm glad you said something tonight. lt's good to reconnect. lt was so good to see you, Craig. JUD Y: There you are. l've been looking for you! l've told everyone. -Told everyone what? -Votes for Reunion Queen. Pass. About you, Tru. Saving Candace. They all agree you're a big hero. But I wish we had BiIIy's pictures. I was taIking to-- l've got something really important to do, and l'm sorry, but l can't be distracted. -Tru! -All right! HARRlSON: ls this a bad time? l know how eager you were to have us here tonight. Great. Hey! What are you doing here? l didn't think you were coming. Hey! What are you doing here? l didn't think you were coming. l wasn't, but then l remembered. l got some business to take care of. Sorry about the surprise. lt seemed like a good idea about half an hour ago. -No, it's fine. -You sure? -lt's just been kind of a crazy night. -Crazy good, or crazy bad? TRU: That's the thing. l don't know yet. LUC: Okay. Why don't you find me when you figure it out? l'll be at the bar. Brown jacket. You know, l have my own opinion about Candace. TRU: l told you. Now is not the best-- JUD Y: You could've let her drown. TRU: What? You're kidding, right? JUD Y: You know, it isn't fair. Everyone always says Candace has things. She has boyfriends, and she has money... and looks and popularity. But Candace doesn't have those things. -She took them. -What's that? She took them from people like me. l could've been Prom Queen, but Candace took it. Now, you ask me, she deserves everything she gets. Let's get some air. Come on, let's get you out of here. JUD Y: Why? GLENN: [On mike] <i>HeIIo.</i> Can I have your attention, pIease? We finaIIy have aII the baIIots in and it's now time to announce... tonight's CIass of '99 Five Year Reunion Queen. And tonight our Queen is Tru Davies. [Crowd cheering] TRU: No. You don't understand. GLENN: Don't be shy! I think we'd aII Iike to hear a few words. [Cheers] [Tense instrumental music] Excuse me, l've got to go. [Tense instrumental music intensifies] Excuse me. [Dramatic instrumental music] [Tense instrumental music] TRU: Mr. Connor! Tru. You caught me grading papers. CONNOR: Why aren't you inside? TRU: l need your help. -What's the trouble? -l don't have time to explain. l need you to listen. Candace is in danger. l think Judy's going to hurt her. l know a lot of old feelings can get stirred up at these reunions. -But violence? l don't think so. -Normally, l wouldn't either. But you're going to have to believe me. CONNOR: l believe that you believe it. -How can l help? -Have you seen Candace or Judy? -l haven't, but-- -l need you to do me a favor. Let's split up. l'll take this wing, you go that way... and just keep an eye out for either of them. -Please don't ask why. -That'd be two favors, wouldn't it? [Tense instrumental music continues] Judy. lt's not fair, Tru. -Where's Candace? -l said it's not fair! Okay, now you're starting to scare me. l can't take it anymore. lt's like high school all over again. Nothing ever changes. [Soft instrumental music] First, Candace is Prom Queen. Now you. How come it's never my turn? How come girls like Candace always win, and girls like me always lose? All l can tell you, Judy, is, things change, l promise. Now help me out. l need to find Candace. Why is Candace so important to everybody? To you, to Mr. Connor. l'm important, too. What do you mean, Mr. Connor? l just saw her, with him. TRU: You just saw them together? JUD Y: Yeah. Like two minutes ago. [Tense instrumental music] l wrote a novel. lt's called <i>High SchooI ConfidentiaI.</i> CONNOR: So you're sure no one's seen your novel? lt's like l've been telling you, Mr. Connor. No one's seen it. -Why do you keep asking me that? -Just need to be sure. You told me it was no good, that it needed lots of work. Of course l haven't shown it to anyone. l was feeling so good about it, until l showed it to you. Why'd you want to meet me here? lt's so creepy. [Tense instrumental music] l have been trying to write a novel for years, with no success... watching students like you graduate, move on, pass me by. CANDACE: l thought you'd be proud of me. CONNOR: l am. Your first try, you write a book... that l have been trying to put to paper for years. [Tense instrumental music continues] l know my limits, Candace. The only way that l will write a book as great as yours... is if l make it my own. That's impossible. Not if no one's seen it. Not if no one knows. Oh, God. [Tense instrumental music intensifies] No one knows. The only way for you to steal my novel from me-- l am so sorry, Candace. [Dramatic instrumental music] -Tru, what are you doing here? -l was looking for Candace. l just wanted to tell her how much l loved her book. See, the only way this works for you is if nobody's seen it. So now you've got a choice. You can kill Candace and put your name on the book. But you're gonna have to kill me, too. [Somber instrumental music] You won't tell anyone, will you? Not if you resign tomorrow and turn yourself in. You know, it's a shame. The schooI's going to Iose a good teacher. You used to be my favorite, Mr. Connor. But l guess things change. My God. [Upbeat rock music playing on stereo] Ladies and gentIemen of the CIass of '99... pIease weIcome back our Queen, Tru Davies. [All cheering] That's my sister. Hi, everyone. For those of you who remember me... you know I'm not too good at giving speeches. But here goes. High schooI was a time... that pretty much sucked for most of us. Let's face it, it was aII about being picked on or getting Ieft out. But tonight I think we get the chance to change that. We can Iet bygones be bygones. This tiara means a Iot to some peopIe. But it doesn't beIong to me. Judy Rogers. You know everything about everyone in this entire cIass. And you've been waiting five years for this. So that makes you Queen in my book. Why don't you come up here and remind us how great you are? [All applauding] JUD Y: [On mike] <i>Thank you.</i> For once, I'm speechIess. Lindsay? Hi. Glenn, again. Hi. This might sound crazy, but there's something l've always wanted to tell you. l always thought you were the most beautiful girl in school. And then you left that note in my locker. -l left that note in your locker? -That note changed my life. lt did? lt made me realize one very important thing. lf l couldn't have feelings for you, l couldn't have feelings for any girl. Wait a minute. Are you telling me that my note made you realize that you're gay? That note made me gay. And let me tell you something. Come 10th year reunion, that tiara is mine. [Comical instrumental music] God, what a night. My note turned one guy into a liar, another one gay. The power of the written word. -And how was your night? -Typical. Don't even get me started on Harrison, either. My God, Harrison. l totally forgot. He didn't try to pick a fight with Keith Morgan, did he? -Now l remember you. -Drinks are up, ladies. They've been like that all night. l thought they were going to fight, but then Luc just started laughing at them. Now they're the Three freaking Amigos. LlNDSAY: Lucky me. l'll be right back. There's something l have to take care of. [Humming] Candace, how you holding up? l'm fine. Why? l was just wondering. After the ordeal you went through-- -l don't need your pity. -lt's not pity, Candace. lt's friendship. To be honest, l don't need that, either. Candace, we used to be best friends. l know things change. We're not friends now, but maybe that could change, too. l know l'd really like that. What do you say? [Soft instrumental music] Sorry, Tru.
