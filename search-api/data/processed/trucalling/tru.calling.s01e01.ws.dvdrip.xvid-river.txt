TRU: Yes. MOTHER: <i>It's okay, Tru.</i> TRU: Okay, Mommy. PRlEST: Before her time, to a person.... -[Whispering] She forgave me. -[Whispering] What? -Who? -Mom. She forgave me for not being able to help her... and she said she's okay. You have a vivid imagination. But Mom was murdered, in front of you. What part of that is okay? PRlEST: ...a wife and mother... taken before her time. God, he's so full of crap. TRU: l just wish-- MERE: You just wish what? That l could go back to that day and help her. You can't. None of us can. PRlEST: ''A time to be born, and a time to die.'' [Fast-paced instrumental music] TRU: Hey, the garbage man says the elevator's out again. NElGHBOR: Elevator's out. PROFESSOR: <i>Dominick Barren.</i> PROFESSOR: <i>EIizabeth Christianson.</i> Tru Davies. Where is she? PROFESSOR: <i>Tru Davies.</i> [Tense instrumental music] [All cheering] [Fast-paced instrumental music continues] TRU: l've got a drinking game. lt's called ''You graduated from college and your family didn't show up.'' A drinking game, or ''Next on Dr. Phil''? l'm so sorry, Tru. l know they missed all your track meets, but.... To be expected. Harrison probably met a girl... Meredith probably met a client, and my father.... No acknowledgment of children from his first marriage. Thanks, Cameron, but l think l'm out. -Already? But we just got here. -What? lnternship starts tomorrow at the hospital. l thought l'd make a nice first impression by not showing up hung over. Tru? Prof. Evans. Lindsay, would you stop it already? She thinks l've got a thing for him. But l've told her, professors aren't exactly my type. Good night, guys. And congratulations. We made it. [Lindsay whoops] [Alarm blares rock music] [Sighs] [Neighbors moaning in ecstasy] [Bed creaking] Unbelievable. MARK: Congratulations. Yesterday, you were an ethics violation... and today you are a faculty girlfriend. [Tru chuckles] l meant what l said, Tru. Now that you graduated, we could go public. l'm sure the Dean will be very happy to hear it. Well, the Dean's opinion no longer matters. ln fact, l'm gonna see her tonight at the faculty banquet. Maybe it's time l told her about you. TRU: What are you gonna say? MARK: Not a word. l'm just gonna show her those Polaroids that l took. [Cell phone ringing] WOMAN: [On TV] <i>HeIIo, and weIcome to</i> another Monday Morning Money. TRU: Hello? HARRlSON: <i>Tru, it's your favorite brother.</i> l'm in a bit of a situation. What's it this time, Harrison? Don't tell me you played cards all night. No, not all night. HARRlSON: Just since 2:00. Look, whatever you have would help, $1,000, $200 even. It's just a Ioan. I'm teIIing you, Tru. I am on a streak today. lf you're on a streak, why do you need to borrow money? You know I don't have that kind of cash. l have to get to the hospital. But l'll see you tonight, right? HARRlSON: <i>Yeah, right. Sure.</i> Anyway, l'll go Plan B on this one. ProbabIy shouId've started there anyway. And Tru? l hope it was nice yesterday. -l would've been there if l could, but-- -l know, Harry. TRU: You lost your funding? But my internship.... What happens now? DR. GREEN: l'm sorry, Tru. Really. l know. You were counting on this job... for a little cash and credibility for med school. There's this other job l heard about. Now don't get excited, it may not be the exact right fit. You were a track star, right? Well, why don't you run down, see this guy as soon as you can? DR. GREEN: Tell him l sent you. lt's a good job? Trust me. People would die for it. DAVlS: You ever been to a morgue before? Just once, when l was 12. Well, that sounds like a story. Are you sure you're interested in working here? Because, l'll be honest, most girls as pretty as you that come here.... Well, they're dead. l'll be applying to medical school in the fall... and my advisor thought it might be a good idea. What? Your eyeliner. ls that MAC Number 5? Seven. Seven. Nice. DAVlS: The opening is for a forensic attendant, who retrieves the body... weighs it, measures it, attaches the toe tag... charts the vitals, and collects the standards. ''Standards''? Head hair, pubic hair, nail clippings. And then they prepare the body for storage. DAVlS: lt's called the crypt. lt's where every unnatural death in the city comes to rest... waiting for an autopsy. -You said ''unnatural death''? -Most of them. DAVlS: Because if there's even a hint that a death might be unnatural... murder, suicide, they come here. -So every crypt.... -Has a body. That's right. [Rhythmic instrumental music] [Davis sighs] Can you imagine the pain of losing someone before their time? Bottom line... most of these people shouldn't be dead yet. Go ahead, you can open one. [Rhythmic instrumental music swells] DAVlS: <i>I need you to start tonight.</i> The graveyard shift. -And you're going to take it? -l just told you l was. l mean, if it looks good to medical schools, who am l to say no? Look at me. lf l don't get some sleep soon, l'm gonna get bags under my bags. You haven't been sleeping again? Let's not play this game tonight, okay? l feel good. Hey, Tru. Remember when it didn't take her death anniversary to get us all together? l'll see you inside. Mere, you forgot your... [Somber instrumental music] bag. So, what's Harrison's excuse this time? A girl? A truckload of DVDs? A girl with a truckload of DVDs? Well, l guess we all deal with the anniversary differently. -Harrison plays cards. -You pretend it didn't happen. And you, l guess you'd call them old habits. You went through my bag? Damn it, Tru. What are you doing? People like you can't just use once, Mere. Or didn't they teach you that in rehab? l'm sorry. Look, l just.... You must be doing something right. You've got a great career, lots of money-- You know, maybe Harrison had the right idea. -He doesn't even pretend anymore. -Don't walk out, Mere. Please, we can.... [Cell phone rings] Hello. Harrison? Oh, my God, look at you. TRU: Hospital called and said-- HARRlSON: l prayed for a 10 of clubs... and this is what l get. A nice reminder of why l don't believe in God. Ten of clubs? What happened? They did this to you? Those guys you were playing cards with? TRU: l'm coming with you. HARRlSON: No, Tru. Harrison, look at you. You had your chance, Tru. You can't help me now. DOCTOR: Clear. [Defibrillator whining] MARCO: First one? Congratulations. But they're all not as pretty as... Rebecca Morgan. What happened to her? MARCO: You mean, aside from the cap in the back of her neck? Nothing. The neighbors heard a gunshot around 10:00. We found her in her apartment. lt's a nice one-bedroom, if you know anyone. Do me a favor. Hold that bag open, will you? [Suspenseful instrumental music] Do you know who did it? You're new here, so maybe nobody told you. We don't solve the crime. We just deliver the body. MARCO: Anyway, have a good night.... TRU: Tru. Tru? Catchy. But wait. You're leaving? Because Davis said my first night I wouIdn't be aIone. You won't be. You'll have 32 friends right next door. [Suspenseful instrumental music continues] GHOSTLYFEMALE VOlCE: OnIy you can save me. GHOSTLY FEMALE VOlCE: HeIp. [Eerie instrumental music] GHOSTLY FEMALE VOlCE: <i>Tru.</i> TRU: Hello? TRU: Marco? GHOSTLY FEMALE VOlCE: <i>HeIp.</i> Very funny, hazing the new girl. GHOSTLY FEMALE VOlCE: <i>HeIp me.</i> [Eerie instrumental music continues] [Tense instrumental music] GHOSTLY FEMALE VOlCE: <i>HeIp me.</i> GHOSTLY FEMALE VOlCE: <i>Save me.</i> [Tense instrumental music intensifies] Help me. [Dramatic instrumental music] [Alarm blares rock music] [Neighbors moaning in ecstasy] [Bed creaking] MARK: Congratulations. Yesterday, you were an ethics violation... and today you are a faculty girlfriend. But l meant what l said, Tru. Now that you graduated, we can go public. [Dramatic instrumental music] What's wrong? What was l thinking? l never should have taken that job. -What job? -At the morgue. The graveyard shift. That place creeps me out. The morgue? Sweetie, your internship starts this morning at the hospital. No, Green's funding was cut. The job has been eliminated. l saw him yesterday. Yesterday was Sunday. You graduated yesterday. MARK: You had a drink with some friends, you went to bed with me. MARK: Nobody had to go to work at a morgue. lt was just a bad dream, or one too many margaritas. TRU: Yeah, it just seemed-- MARK: By the way... tonight's the faculty banquet, and l think it's time the Dean knew about you. TRU: Tonight? MARK: Actually l wasn't gonna say a word. I was just gonna show her the PoIaroids that I took. [Cell phone ringing] WOMAN: [On TV] <i>HeIIo, and weIcome to</i> another Monday Morning Money. TRU: Hello? HARRlSON: <i>Tru, it's your favorite brother.</i> l'm in a bit of a situation. We were through this yesterday, Harrison. l don't have that kind of money. HARRlSON: What are you talking about? Look, are you mad because l didn't go to your graduation? And your second number... TRU: Four. HARRlSON: <i>Are you Iistening?</i> WOMAN: [On TV] <i>...is four.</i> HARRlSON: <i>Tru?</i> Listen, Harrison, maybe you shouldn't go back to that table. Maybe you should walk away now. Yeah. See you, Tru. WOMAN: [On TV] <i>Your third number...</i> TRU: Twenty-nine. ...is 29. [Fast-paced instrumental music] TRU: <i>You never met me?</i> l have never met you. Then again, l haven't been going to the gym lately so.... [Rhythmic instrumental music] MAC Number 7. The crypt. This way, right? You sure you haven't worked in a morgue before? So this is the crypt. This is where every.... Is there something I can heIp you with? Last night, a woman named Rebecca Morgan died. TRU: She was brought here. DAVlS: A friend of yours? [Suspenseful instrumental music] Who was on duty last night? Marco, l think. No, she never came in. You said.... l mean, someone said... that the bodies brought here, they're unnatural deaths. Some of them, yes. So those people shouldn't actually be dead. Not yet, anyway. ls it hard to see people dead before their time? Yes. But if you're gonna work here... you've got to accept the fact that there's nothing you can do about it. That was a job offer, in case you missed it. TRU: What happened to her? The neighbors heard a gunshot at 10:00. The truth is we're shorthanded... and you seem to already know the operation. TRU: l'll take it. DAVlS: Great. DAVlS: l'll need you tonight. Tru? 303 West 23rd Street. LlNDSAY: <i>Who is she?</i> TRU: l don't know yet. Hopefully, no one. LlNDSAY: <i>Each time I hope</i> someone is no one... they always turn out to be someone. Maybe you'll have better luck. So anyways, are you really serious about this job at the morgue? Because l got to be honest... l think it's really gonna cut into our post-college slacking off. TRU: <i>Lindsay, I'II caII you back.</i> Oh, Tru. Tru? [Fast-paced instrumental music] She's alive. TRU: For another 10 hours. [Fast-paced instrumental music continues] [Dramatic instrumental music] [Suspenseful instrumental music] [Dialing phone] WOMAN: <i>HeIIo?</i> Coffee, please. REBECCA: You okay? TRU: Yeah. l'm just having a strange day. Maybe you'd like something a little stronger than coffee, then. Coffee's fine. The truth is l shouldn't complain. l have this friend who's about to have a worse day... and she doesn't even know it yet. -This is gonna sound crazy, but-- -Hold on. Hello? What are you.... Aaron, we've been through all this. No, l can't do this right now. Goodbye, Aaron. [Suspenseful instrumental music continues] Some people just don't know when it's over. Rebecca, l'm gonna tell you something. How do you know my name? We know each other? That friend about to have the bad day-- Hey. You know what, never mind. My bad. REBECCA: <i>HeIp me.</i> l don't know how to say this, so l'm just gonna say it. -You're gonna die today, Rebecca. -What did you just say? You have to trust me. Maybe we can stop it. We have nine hours. -You asked for my help. Now l need yours. -l asked for your help? You're crazy. Just tell me why someone would want to hurt you. REBECCA: Gary? TRU: Why would they want.... REBECCA: Can you come here? GARY: What's up? REBECCA: There's this girl saying strange things. GARY: What girl? REBECCA: The one right at the bar. REBECCA: Come outside. GARY: What did she say? REBECCA: She said l was gonna die today. GARY: What? Where? [Fast-paced instrumental music] lt would've been perfect with Rebecca... if only l could've convinced her to fall in love with me. lt's funny. Tru, right? She never mentioned you before. Well, l just started there. Weekends. Gary thought we needed some extra help. What kind of trouble do you think she's in? lt's hard to say. l know it's a long shot... but do you know anyone who would want to hurt her? No, although she didn't need any help in that department. She beat herself up over the smallest things. Bad day, blow an audition. -Actors, sure. -Dance. She's a dancer. Well, thanks. Like l said, she'd kill me if she knew l was here so.... lt's funny. A girl's in trouble, and everybody suspects the ex-boyfriend. Aaron, no, that's not what-- No, l'm saying lucky for me l'm not the only one. His name's Elliot Winters. [Upbeat instrumental music] Do you have a résumé for me, or should l just call security? Actually, l'm not here for an interview. l'm here about Rebecca. -Rebecca? -Rebecca Morgan. l'm not passing judgment. Obviously-- My daughter's dance teacher. Why would you.... Okay, l don't understand. So you two weren't.... Was she interested? Sure. Was l flattered? Absolutely. But those pictures over there aren't for show. ELLlOT: That's my life. l don't know what she told you... but sometimes being a good friend means not listening so closely. Anyway, Iots to do. So why are you so worried about Rebecca? Because she's gonna die today. Don't worry about calling security. l'll show myself out. Are you sure you're okay? My God, that actually sounds like genuine concern. Wait a second. Who is this, and what have you done with my sister? lt's just, l know how stressed you get. Especially today. MERE: <i>I can't taIk right now, Tru.</i> I'II see you tonight, okay? And call me crazy, but l actually think Harrison's gonna make it this year. [Tru gasps] You tell your friend Rebecca that if this is a threat... it's not gonna work. We've been down this road before, she and l. We're over. Done. lf she insists on going to my wife, l'll do everything in my power to stop her. ELLlOT: Everything. [Elevator bell dings] [Gasping] l'll see you. [Tense instrumental music] Can't win them all, right? Where's the fun of that? Guys, relax. HARRlSON: She's my sister. TRU: <i>Leave now.</i> l'm telling you, cash in and walk away now. Are you kidding me? You saw the stack of chips l had in there. l'm up! Now, Harry. You're up now, but it's not gonna last. l thought you said you were short. -l took a marker from the house. -What? A loan. Great, so you're playing with house money. Are you okay? HARRlSON: ls everything okay? TRU: l'm having a day, Harrison. A day l'd gladly explain to you if l could... but l can't, so l'm not even gonna try it. And l heard another voice. Wait. l don't understand. You mean, like Mom? TRU: <i>Okay, Mommy.</i> No, not her. Someone else. Dead? -Oh, boy. -And that's not even the half of it. Believe it or not, that's the half that makes sense. l don't get it. Me, of all people, why do they come to me? Maybe because they know that you'll listen. [Soft instrumental music] Do you think l'm crazy? l never thought you were crazy. l gotta get back, okay? Just do me a favor. Slow down the betting to give me more time. -For what? -For figuring out a way to save your ass. TRU: <i>Gary, I reaIIy need to taIk to her.</i> l told you, she wasn't feeling well. Needed some air. It seems to be happening a Iot IateIy. ANNOUNCER: [On TV] <i>One-one deIivery.</i> TRU: What's the score? GARY: Seven-one, Sox. Top of the ninth. l'll bet you $100 they lose. -What, are you crazy? -Maybe. Don't know yet. REBECCA: Sorry, Gary. l lost track of time. GARY: This girl says she knows you. Stay away from me. Don't come near me. l know you don't understand. Me, neither, but l wanna help-- You want to help? Why don't you start by leaving me alone? GARY: You know what, maybe you'd better listen to her. TRU: Gary, she's in trouble. And she has no idea how much. GARY: Why should l believe you? TRU: All right. Here's the thing. lf the Sox win, l'm good for the $100. But if they lose, you help me. [Fast-paced instrumental music] MAN: Got a letter for Meredith Davies. Tru, this is a surprise. Guess l thought it was about time l saw your office. l see. Trying to make me feel guilty about missing your graduation? -l'm sorry, Tru-- -God, what happened to us? We used to be close, all of us. Now l find myself doing more for strangers than l do for my own family. What are you talking about? Any second, someone's gonna hand you an envelope. An envelope with coke inside. Just don't touch it, Mere. Tru, your newfound concern is touching. MERE: lt's psychotic, but touching. Because no one is bringing me coke. Much less an envelope full of it to my office. Really, Tru, trust me. Boy, you have some imagination, you know that? You know, l'm not sure where you get all your facts but.... [Somber instrumental music] ls this how you get your kicks? By convincing yourself you're not the most screwed-up one in the family? You can't fix people, Tru. You can't save them. Not Mom 10 years ago, not me. And at this rate, probably not even yourself. -Why do l think you're lying to me? -l shouldn't have looked through the files. TRU: l just have a few questions. DAVlS: What about? Unsolved murders? TRU: Exactly. DAVlS: <i>So Iet me get this straight.</i> DAVlS: ln the eight hours since you've been here... you've decided to solve old cases? Very ambitious. You know what l did today? l bought socks. TRU: l'm just curious. What can you say about a woman who comes in with a bullet in her neck? -That she's dead? -Davis. Okay, fine. Bullet in the neck. l'm guessing her death was execution style. Meaning she did something to someone to make them angry. DAVlS: Small caliber bullet. Probably a .22. How so? From what you said, there was no exit wound. The bullet just lodged itself in her neck. And I'II be honest with you. You don't have to go through this troubIe to impress me. AII I need is for someone to show up to work on time. Davis, thanks. l gotta run. DAVlS: A pretty girl's nothing but trouble. [Tense instrumental music] Beaten up. What? -How could you possibly know that? -Just trust me, okay? And take this. TRU: Think of it as an answer to a prayer. HARRlSON: There are 52 cards in a deck. The chances of this saving me from a beating.... Have a little faith in your sister, okay? Remember when l said you weren't crazy? l may have to rethink my position, you know. [Cell phone rings] How the hell did you know the Sox were gonna blow it? TRU: Where is she, Gary? GARY: <i>She went to see Winters.</i> [Fast-paced instrumental music] Charles, hello. Mrs. Winters: lt's wonderful. I'm so proud of you. [Cell phone rings] Want to know what's worse than watching academics congratulate themselves? lt's watching them eat. Are you feeling any better? This morning you seemed a little-- l can't even begin to describe to you what this day's been like. -Don't worry. lt'll be over soon enough. -Yeah, let's hope so. Mark, l gotta go. [Tense instrumental music] [Tense instrumental music intensifies] Don't do it. He'll kill you. l still don't understand how could you possibly know... that Elliot would kill me? Let's just say l've seen what he's capable of. lt's amazing how charming a man can be when he wants to get in... and how callous he can be when he wants to get out. God, l thought going there would change his mind. AARON: Rebecca. [Rebecca sighs] -Aaron, what are you doing here? -l was worried about you. l thought you said you couldn't find that key? She came to see me, said you might be in some sort of trouble. REBECCA: l'm fine, Aaron. Everything's fine. You can go now. AARON: l don't want to leave. l want to work things out. You don't have to be alone, especially now. REBECCA: l'm not gonna start this again with you. l want you to go. AARON: Rebecca, l came here to help you. TRU: No, you didn't. [Tense instrumental music] He came here to kill you. [Dramatic instrumental music] What are you talking about? This is crazy. Right. About as crazy as the .22 caliber in your pocket. -What, this? -Oh, my God. This is for you to protect yourself. Don't be so blind, Rebecca. You need this. You know what he's capable of. Elliot. Why don't you give me the gun, Aaron? And by the way, who the hell are you really? You think you're doing her a favor, messing with her life? lf you ask me, l think it's a really good way to get hurt. [Tense instrumental music continues] One. Elliot would never hurt me. lt's you, Aaron. What are you talking about? What is me? Why are you defending him? You're always defending him... -even after what he did to you! -Did to me? -He didn't do anything to me. l'm just-- -Pregnant. You're pregnant. Folic acid prescribed for pregnancy. Aaron, listen to me. You don't even know it... but you're getting a second chance to not kill two people... so just give me the gun. Becky, l never wanted to hurt you. l just wanted to help, you know that. You need to go, Aaron. Now. No, just leave him. Lock the door. Stay inside and call the police. He has to go home some time. What? l just realized. l never said ''thank you.'' [Slow instrumental music] [Tense instrumental music] [Speaking in Asian language] Mr. Chiang wants to remind you... all debts must be settled immediately following the last hand. Yeah, l got the memo. [Suspenseful instrumental music] [Harrison whoops] HARRlSON: A pleasure, fellows. How did you know? l mean, the 10 of clubs. Right there. Seriously, how did you know? Let's just say l've been a step ahead of everyone all day. Of course, l didn't make a dime. Every penny l won went back to the Tram to pay off the marker. There's a story here, right? Yeah, there's a story. l almost didn't recognize you guys. l said, ''That can't be my family. Too much damn happiness.'' -lt was good to see you today, Tru. -Was it? MERE: Yeah, it was. See, l told you Harrison was gonna show this year. l'll be right back. Order me a club soda. You and Meredith, getting along? Just when l thought things couldn't get any stranger.... [Sniffing] [Somber instrumental music] Do you ever think Mom's still watching us? God, l hope not... because l'm not sure she'd like what she sees. Yeah. Maybe she's trying to change that. [Cell phone rings] HARRlSON: That's a nice outfit, by the way. TRU: Hello? Hi, is this a bad time? Because l can call back. No, it's fine. Is everything okay, Davis? Yeah, l was thinking about that girl, you know, the dead one? And l thought of another reason there might not be an exit wound. What's that? Order what you want. l'll split it with you. You know the entry wound in her neck? DAVlS: Maybe that wasn't an entry wound. Maybe that was an exit wound. That would mean the bullet went through-- Her mouth. Yes, exactly. Which, if you ask me, sounds seIf-infIicted. -Meaning it wasn't a homicide. -lt was suicide. [Fast-paced instrumental music] [Tense instrumental music] The thing is l always wanted to be a mother. [Melancholic instrumental music] A house, the kids, all of it. My only mistake was believing that he wanted it, too. Rebecca. REBECCA: Maybe he did. Just not with his mistress. Because when l told him about the baby... he made it clear that's all l ever was. But it's not all you're gonna be. You're gonna be a mom, Rebecca. Take it from someone who lost hers way too soon. You're supposed to live. There's no better reason to. Your mother? Was killed... ten years ago, in front of me... by a man they never found. lt wasn't her time then... and it's not yours now. Rebecca, will you give me the gun? [Clock ticking] [Upbeat instrumental music] [Door opens] MARCO: Hey, you new here? TRU: Sort of. Do you mind? An eager one. Go ahead. Knock yourself out. MARCO: We found her in her apartment. You should've seen this place. lt was a nice one-bedroom, if you know anyone. Cancer. It's a bitch. So, first one? No. Second. MAN: [On radio] <i>It's sunny and miId on</i> this beautifuI Tuesday morning, May 27. Traffic copter reports no major deIays en route. [Soft instrumental music] TRU: <i>It's been the strangest day.</i> An understatement, I know. Did you have anything to do with it? I don't know. I onIy know I wish this day had come 10 years earIier. Then maybe I couId've saved you, too. Instead I'II wait... for others. Some who have needed me Ionger than most. So maybe I couIdn't save you. Maybe, just maybe...
