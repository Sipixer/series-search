Happy birthday! - I'm sorry, I still can't quite... - You heard me. Two's all you get. I know how you love your birthday and all, but I got some things to do today. Oh, and your gift, in the works. Not here yet. And Dad, he's in Omaha, and he sends his love. No, he doesn't. He forgot again. But thank you for lying. What are all these things you have to do today? When Dad's out of town you get a day off. Yeah, but not today. Check it out. He wants me to talk to a guy who might have seen something... ...about someone that could help out a guy. I don't know, it's pretty big stuff. Hey, so, what's the plan for the festive B-day? Well, I figure I'm a 23-year-old with a mystical gift and a credit card... ...so I'm gonna treat myself to something special. Maybe some hot dogs? It's looking a little thin in here, Tru. There's this jade necklace that's been calling my name... ...which is much less creepy than what usually calls my name. Ha! Yeah, jewelry. Mmm. You women think us guys notice stuff like that. We don't. Other guys notice jewelry. You just don't. You know what? It's time for me to get this day started. Hey, push. You know what? I'm taking these. - Hey, Avery. - Hey, Tru. - Hello, Mr. Gorenstein. - Happy birthday. I love that necklace. Is that new? Why, yes, it is. A little treat from me to me. I'm glad you noticed. I did. But the guys won't. They never notice that stuff. And besides, everybody's all distracted by the engagement. - What? Who's engaged? - Jensen and Lexi. Lexi. I heard him mention her, but I didn't know they were that serious. Well, it was all very impulsive. Tyler's in love with love. His diary is going to be full tonight. Hey! Hey, congratulations. She's getting a great guy. - Thanks. - She is. I hope she knows it. She's very excited. I didn't know everybody else was excited. Living vicariously. Exactly. None of us have anything going on. I can't even remember the last time I saw a guy naked. Okay. - Hey, nice necklace. - Thank you. Davis? Davis? Oh, my gosh! - Who put this all together? - Harrison and I. He was supposed to put a deposit down on a nicer place, but that didn't pan out. Well, there was a little hiccup in the money situation. But look, this way I get to set up your gift right here. Come, look. Come here. What...? Pinch yourself. It's not a dream. Oh. It's a hot tub. Yeah! Look, now, don't get too excited. It's only rented for one night. Davis, you let him bring this here? I like the bubbles. Just wait and see how it rocks the party. Okay. Need to get this thing up and running. He tripped a circuit breaker. I'll call Maintenance. Wait, don't bother, doc. - It's a lot nicer this way. - Ambience. - Tru! - Hey! - Nice place. - Yeah, it's morbid and strange... ...but we are happy to be here. - Thank you. Hey, come here, I want you guys to meet. This is my friend and boss, Davis. This is Tyler and Avery from my anatomy class. Right. We talked to Davis when he invited us. Oh, yeah, right. It's nice to meet you. Oh, and this is my little brother, Harrison. Avery, Tyler. - Hi. - Hi. Harrison. That's a good name. I like that. - Thank you. - Hey, did you guys see the hot tub? My brother has me confused with the cast of <i>The Bachelor</i>. - I do now. - I brought my swimsuit. - Where can we change? - First takers. Right. Come with me. Davis, I love my party. Thank you so much. Oh, yeah. Oh, I got you a gift as well. - So let me go get it. - Awesome. - Tru, hey, happy birthday. - Hey. - I don't think that you've met Lexi. - Lexi, at last. Best wishes. Thank you. It's all a whirlwind right now. You know, I'm just kind of waiting for it to settle in. I've never been in a morgue before. This is absolutely fascinating. There aren't any bodies here tonight, but feel free to look. Yeah? You wanna look around? I swear you're gonna love this. Okay. Yeah. I just don't wanna look at anything in a jar. - Have fun. - Thanks, Tru. Hi. I don't understand how it looks so nice in the store. - They put it in a box first. - Oh. Maybe I should put it in a... No, don't you dare. - It's hats. - Yeah, it's two hats. You know the expression "wearing two hats"? It symbolizes your two fields of endeavor. One for med school and one for rewriting destiny here at the morgue. Shoot. Carrie's here. Okay, this is getting a little ridiculous, don't you think? Come here. - Hi, Carrie. - Hi. Happy birthday. Thanks. - Could you excuse me one sec? - Sure. - Hey, Davis. Ask her to stay. - No, you ask her to stay. Davis! Carrie, would you like to stay? I would love to. Great. - Hey, how's it going in there? - I'm just embracing life. Is this safe? - I cannot believe you'd do this! - Tell him the truth. - This is not your business! - It is! And if you won't tell him, then I will! Let go of me! - Everybody gather around. - You have to tell him! It's cake time. Wow. Happy birthday, Tru. - What's that? - It's just a circuit breaker. Hey, take advantage of it, people. Nobody's gonna know who did what when the lights come back on. Okay. Tru. - Harrison, is that you? - What? - Tru, what's going on? - <i>Help me</i>. Not what I wished for. Help me. Don't settle in, Harry. I'm heading out. Something happened, and I don't know who it happened to. I thought your birthday was supposed to be giggles... ...and love for the people of the Earth. - Yeah, I had that birthday yesterday. You had a replay on your birthday? Huh. Is there anything I should do, or not do? Did I screw up? You threw me a party, which was a really sweet thought, actually. Give it up for the brother. Just because you're my brother doesn't mean you're the brother. And this time, don't throw me a party at the morgue. Especially with a rented hot tub, which does not count as my gift, by the way. - Wait. I threw you a party at the morgue? - It doesn't matter. Just cancel the whole thing. It wouldn't be a surprise anymore. Lock up when you leave? - Hot dogs, bottom shelf. - Thank you. So you couldn't tell anything from the voice? It was a loud whisper. It was, you know, harsh. But I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman. It was dark. You have no idea who asked for help? There were no bodies for processing. It wasn't you or Harrison. - You guys were next to me. - Then it was a guest. Great. Come for the cheese cubes, stay for the death. - I am cursed. Am I like Typhoid Mary? - Shh... How many people that I know am I gonna have to save? Maybe it wasn't someone you know. Maybe it was someone who came with someone you know. Aren't you a bundle of bright side. Okay, well, let's just think for a minute. Who was there? You mean here. You, me, Harrison, Carrie, friends from school, Jensen... Wait, Carrie was here? She came by, and you asked her to stay. - I did? Did she stay? Did she stay? - You were masterful. Oh, God, I hope she's okay. I could never live with myself if I was responsible for her being here. Davis, odds are she's fine. Let's just look at everyone before we narrow it down. All right, Tyler was in the hot tub. And that was messing with the electricity. So maybe it was him or the maintenance guy. - Did you say hot tub? - And it was really dark. So anyone could slip by the rinse basin. - There was a hot tub? - And before the lights went out... ...Avery was having a huge fight with Lexi. If you won't tell him, then I will! - Okay, who's Lexi? - Jensen's fiancée. - Hey. - I don't think that you've met Lexi. It looked like it was gonna get violent. Lexi could've shoved her or strangled her. Avery was saying, "If you don't tell him, I will." I think she's the victim. It sounds like Lexi's got a secret, and Avery knows about it. I guess I'd better find out too. Harrison! Look at you, man. You look great. Robust. Like a man who's been taking care of himself. So my continuing to be alive isn't bothering you? Oh, you mean because it runs counter to the plan of the universe... ...and every day you're setting in motion consequences that can be damaging... ...to the entire human race? Now, why would that bother me? Later, Jack. - Ass. - Lucky Broad. Lucky Broad, Kentucky Rascal, Better Off Sailing. Races five, six and seven. Oh, and Rascal's a long shot, so bet big. What are you doing, man? I haven't made a bet in months. Why not? There's no rule against profiting from a rewind, Harrison. You know, Tru could make you a millionaire if she wanted to. It breaks my heart to see the way that girl treats you. That is so sweet. You remembered those names just for me. No, I remembered them for me. Good deeds don't pay enough to live on. But hey, if you're not interested, forget I said anything. Already did, man. Already did. - Hey, Avery. - Tru, happy birthday. You must really like your birthday. I'm just glad to see you, that's all. So, what's with the commotion? You'll never believe it. Jensen and Lexi got engaged. Really? Wow, I haven't met her. What's she like? Uh, she's good. I mean, she's crazy about him, so I guess that that's good. Huh. That was wishy and at the same time washy. That's not like you. You usually lay it all out. I know. I love that about me. Yeah, I don't know. I guess I like her fine. It just all seems a little fast. Oh. It's all terribly romantic. - Morning. - Jensen, congratulations. I'm taking you guys out for a congratulatory lunch. Right after lab over at Café Geneva. All of us, plus Lexi. It'll be my chance to meet her. That's amazingly generous of you, Tru. I'll call Lex. I'm sure she'd love to come. Yeah, I'm in. I love their desserts. I'm shaking hands with a small intestine. Can we hold the food talk? - They have key lime pie. - I do like key lime pie. You sure it was our client you dropped at the airport? Sure, I'm sure. Look, he was late for a flight. He's talking to his girlfriend on the cell phone. She's at the airport. So she's completely ticked off. In fact, she's so angry... ...he promised he'd fly her to the Caribbean just because she's mad! Lucky broad to find a sucker like that guy. - Lucky Broad. - Yeah. Anyway, I drive like a madman, I get him there on time... ...he still doesn't give me a decent tip. So yeah, I remember the guy. - Lucky Broad. - Is that it? Oh, yeah, that's it. - You don't want me to sign something? - No. That was great. That was great. No, lab's still going. I'm just ducking into the hall. But the point is, I'm too soon. Whatever Lexi's secret is, Avery doesn't know yet. I got Jensen to invite Lexi to a lunch so I can work on her and watch them. I'm hearing birds. Where are you anyway? I'm hiding behind a tree. I'm watching Carrie buy coffee. - What? Davis, that's stalking. - <i>No, it's not.</i> I wanna make sure she's not in danger. Davis, we have no reason... ...to believe that she's involved in this. - Are you Carrie Allen? - I'll call you back. I'm Jack Harper. I worked at the morgue with Tru and Davis. They've said such nice things about you. - They're good people. - That they are. That they are. I just wanted to say hi and put a face with the name. That was very nice of you to introduce yourself. I'm sure I'll see you around. - Excuse me. What was that? - Davis. I was just introducing myself. I'm a friend of a friend. Stay away from Carrie. Stay away from her, okay? Do you have a personal stake in this, Davis? Is this an affair of the heart? That's adorable. It is. I would protect anyone I saw you talking to. Funny, I was talking to my landlady this morning. I didn't see you lurking then. I just hope you know what you're getting into. See you around, doc. Tru, everything has just changed. Do you not get it, Tru? Jack is hanging around. He's staying close to make sure she dies again. You've gotta get to the morgue. I want to, but I can't right now. I've gotta find out Lexi's secret. Handle Carrie yourself until I get back. Look, Carrie is gonna die if we don't find out about her past. - What is the motive, who is the killer? - You're right, we should do that. So here's an idea. We could get Harrison. He follows people for a living. He watches her while you research. Just hang on. Can I get $2 to win on...? Bosses, huh? They never seem to leave you alone. I can't reach him. He must be on assignment. Listen, you gotta... I just can't do this on my own. Yes, you can do this. Look, just talk to her. Find out if anyone would have a motive. - Look... - Avery was in danger at my party. Lexi was furious. I've seen people look like that. I've gotta stick with this. Okay, just get here as fast as you can, okay? Okay. This was such a great idea, Tru. It's such a pleasure to meet you. Yeah, you too. The engagement was the perfect opportunity. Jensen tells me you're from right here in town? Yeah, I went to high school at Adams High just down the street. If those other girls could see me now, huh? Engaged to a doctor. - It's almost a cliché. - I'm not a doctor yet. And so you work here in town too? I'm a receptionist at a little insurance company. But I'll probably quit now. - Champagne! - None for me. I'm volunteering at the clinic later. - You probably shouldn't. - Yeah, no champagne for me either. - Thank you. - No champagne, Lexi? Are you pregnant? - Avery. - Oh. I'm sorry. I do that a lot. I just kind of say things. I didn't mean to sound blunt or anything. But seriously, are you like an alcoholic or...? - Should we say? - Yeah. I mean, they're gonna find out soon enough. So yeah, go ahead. We are pregnant. Wow, that's... Huh. I guess congratulations. I didn't want you guys to think that's the reason we're getting married. No. But it is why I said yes, so... At least she's an amazing girl. I knew this was where we were gonna end up. Excuse me, guys. - What are you doing here? - Look, they've got fondue. Do you ever have one of those days when you just want fondue? Stay away from my friends. Oh, yeah, I saw them in there. I haven't met everybody yet. Would you like to introduce me? No? Okay. This is some kind of birthday celebration, isn't it? I almost forgot. I wanted to get you one with some sort of death and resurrection imagery... ...but they didn't have any. So I got you a card with a picture of a cake on it. I think it's time for you to leave now. Tru, you don't want me to meet your friends... ...you don't want me to enjoy fondue. Are you embarrassed by me? Because if you are, it would almost be enough to hurt my feelings. Hi, Carrie. How are you today? You look nice. It occurs to me I don't know a lot about your friends. Like stringent enemies. Such a... Carrie, you're... I like your blouse, blouse. Oh, my God! - Carrie, what's wrong? - Nothing. I know we don't know each other that well yet, but please just tell me. It was a situation that you never think you'd find yourself in. An abusive marriage with a problem drinker. But I just kept hoping that things would get better. I'm so sorry. The thing that amazed me... ...is how much I missed him... ...when he died. - How did he die? - He drowned. He passed out in a bathtub, of all things. The police came, and they asked a lot of questions. And I slowly started to realize that they thought I was somehow involved. Involved? Yeah. He took these thyroid pills, and afterwards nobody could find them. So somebody came up with this theory that I had spiked the bottle... ...with sedatives that I'd stolen from the hospital where I worked. What happened? They never found the pills, so eventually the police just dropped the investigation. But his sister still thought that I did it. I left the suburbs, and I came here. And I thought that I was safe... ...until today. "I know that you did it." They both say the same thing. I found one of them this morning. It was actually rolled up into my newspaper on the front porch. And the other one I found right before you came in. In my purse. I think that maybe that I can help you. And Better Off Sailing and Happy Clam are neck and neck. Lost Cause is closing in on them... ... but it looks like Better Off Sailing may pull this off, people! This is unbelievable! - <i>It's down to the final stretch! Here is...</i> - Whoa! Yes! Yeah! Oh... I didn't know. I did know. Davis, you weren't here, and I couldn't reach you. Listen, Lexi's pregnant, and that's why Jensen's marrying her. - And I think I know what the secret is. - What? Lexi, she's marrying Jensen to make her way up in the world. What could Avery find out that would derail everything for a pregnant bride? Well, what if the baby isn't Jensen's? I mean, it's classic. She would be determined to keep that secret. No, I don't think that's what happened. Avery's volunteering at the clinic this afternoon. And it's a theory... ...but I bet Lexi came in for an exam, or Avery saw her medical records. She knows about the baby's father. - Tru... - Anyway, I'm gonna go tag along... ...as a new volunteer, and maybe I can keep it from happening again. - Tru! - What? Carrie's husband died, and she's got a sister-in-law... ...out in Rockville who blames her. And I think she killed her. And Jack's around to make sure it happens again. Jack's been hanging around Avery too. They can't both be victims. - So he's playing us. - You assume that Carrie is the decoy? - It could've just as well been Avery. - Let's not do this, Davis, please? I wish I could investigate both options, I do. You're gonna have to handle this. Yeah, so you can run off and be with your new friends. - What? - I just don't think you're being objective! What, and you are? I know you like her, and I know what it's like to lose someone you care about. - But, Davis, you're just not being... - No, Tru, you can't do this to me! You can't make this about poor funny little Davis... ...who always loses it when a girl smiles at him. This isn't funny. This is serious. And I've gotta go protect this woman myself? And if she dies because you weren't there to protect her... ...I will never forgive you. So how long have you volunteered here? Years. It's something Jensen got me into when we were both pre-med. - You've known each other a long time? - Yeah, we used to... Well, we used to have a lot of classes together. - You used to go out? - A long time ago. - What happened? - We just became best friends. It's really like 100 times better this way. - You take care of him. - Yeah. And he takes care of me. I mean, he would take care of me, if I let him. And that is my heart-to-heart limit for one day, okay? You got it. So, what's that? This is the sign-in. It's people with appointments. Are you looking for someone? I'm just trying to get a feel for everything, that's all. There's a little filing today, so we should probably start here. - So, what are you gonna do? - Uh... Looks like some records just got sent over, so I gotta sort these. I could do that too. And spin plates and play the kazoo. Take it easy, Tru, all right? You're a superstar, but you do not need to save the world. I guess it just feels like that sometimes. Well, Alexandra Keely. That's Lexi's file, Avery. You shouldn't look at that. - I gotta go. - No, wait, let's talk about this. - You can't confront her. - You don't know what's going on. - Assume I do. - Jensen's being lied to. I know you wanna protect him, but there's a better way. - Let's talk to him together. - Excuse me. - Do you know if there's a sign-in sheet? - Yeah. Over there. Excuse me. Oh. Davis, I found out why Lexi may have wanted to kill Avery. The secret... ... is that there is no baby. I saw her medical records. She had a uterine myoma... ...and got a hysterectomy two years ago. - So she can't be pregnant. - <i>It was a scam...</i> ...to get Jensen to marry her. No wonder Lexi didn't want that to get out. What, so you have a new theory? You'll consider every point of view except mine. I'm not trying to ignore you. I'm trying to prevent a death. Listen, I gotta go, Tru. I have an appointment with the real killer. Thank you for the tea. It's very hot. I'd do anything for the man who's gonna reopen my brother's case. Well, we don't exactly reopen cases at the morgue. We do like to educate ourselves about what happened. I understand that your brother drowned in a bath? Well, that's what she told everyone, but it isn't right. - It doesn't make sense. - But he was a drinker, right? Not so that he'd pass out in the tub. And they never found that bottle of pills. She destroyed it because she knew they could link it to her. But surely a small prescription bottle could be thrown away. No. She killed him. I'm sure that she'll be punished by the universe, not by human hands... ...because that would be wrong. - No, my brother was a good man. He never laid a hand on her, and he never passed out in any bathtub. And don't you tell me about who dispenses justice. I know that no one does because I know what she did. - What's going on? - You're not safe here. Come on. Come on in. I know it's not much, but it has central air... ...which is good because the morgue, when the AC breaks down... ...sometimes we tend to walk around naked and... - Huh. That's beautiful. - Yeah. I got these in Mexico. But you can't eat off them because the glaze will cause severe brain damage. - Would you like a Fresca? - No, thanks. - I like your apartment. - Yeah. I feel so safe here. I'm embarrassed that I showed you these in the first place. It's probably just some neighbor kid playing a joke. Yeah. I don't think so. But you're safe here. You're okay here. I know. She didn't even come back here at all today? - Avery? No. But she called in. - She did? Great. She said she was meeting up with her friend Jensen and his fiancée. Where? Did she say where? Um... Standard Diner. Do you know it? Surprise! I knew you thought I canceled it. I wasn't sure you'd get the message. - I didn't. - Well, you're here, so obviously... Did you see Avery? - Which one's Avery? - Never mind. Excuse me. "Thank you, Harrison. What a lovely surprise." You're welcome, Tru. - Hey, happy birthday again. - Thanks. Have you seen Avery? - I don't think Avery's here yet. - Where's Lexi? Uh, the bathroom, I think. I don't know. Why, what's up? Look, I don't wanna say this, but there's something I have to tell you... ...and it's not... - Tru? I was at the clinic today... ...and Lexi's records were there. - I moved them there. I thought with the baby it'd be good to have the best care. What is this about? I saw the records, and there's something she's not telling you. - You saw the records? - Yeah, I was there with Avery. No, I don't care. I don't wanna know. Whatever you saw is private. - Lf she wants to, she'll tell me about it. - Jensen, she isn't pregnant. - What? - She had a uterine myoma. They performed a hysterectomy. You needed to know. Thank you for deciding what it is that I need. She's playing you. She just wants to marry a doctor... ...and things are about to get bad. - Loving the cheese cubes. Hey, what's up with Jensen? Hmm. Bold. - I can't believe you'd do this! - Tell him the truth. - This is none of your business. - Yes, it is! And if you're not gonna tell him, then I will! Lexi, you have to tell him that you're not pregnant. - Look, shut up. - Now it's a party. Chick fight! Chick fight! I love a chick fight! I'm coming to your birthday every year. Ah, man, this is bad. Lexi, he's going to find out. I know. I know he will. When he does, it's all gonna be ruined. Oh. This is even hotter than a chick fight. But you see, the thing about this is, Lexi is clearly alive... ...and an opportunist and a big no-uterus-having crybaby... ...but I really don't think she's a killer. Happy birthday. Harrison! This was a great party, man. I knew you'd do the right thing with that money. You know, getting everybody here. Jack gave me the names of these horses, and I won... ...and I used the money for the party. But I think that he wanted you here so... Instead of somewhere else. But can you even build a canoe out of concrete? Yeah, of course. With the correct engineering you can. That's how I met my wife actually, at one of those races. Her team won, and then her team dumped my team in the water. I got a bacterial infection, but I didn't mind. That's actually very sweet. It was a long time ago, though. It doesn't hurt to think about it anymore. You know? It'll be the same with you too. You're already making it better. Did you hear that? There's someone in the hallway. Go hide in my room. Hey. Whoa! Davis, you were right. It's not Avery. It never was. It's Carrie. And I am so, so sorry I didn't listen to you. I really am. - That's okay. You're here now. - Is she here? Is she safe? Yeah, she's in the other room. She's safe. Any more notes? Any other suspects besides the sister-in-law? No more notes. I don't think the sister-in-law would do it herself. I think she hired someone. And the notes... ...are clearly an attempt at a blackmail gone bad. I'm still not sure. Davis, stop. You know who wrote these notes. They were both decoys. It wasn't Carrie or Avery. The death is still on, and it's happening in the morgue. But there's no one there. How can it happen again? Because someone is there. - And he was there on day one. - Who? The lights didn't go out because of the hot tub. The wiring is bad. And the maintenance man is there right now. No! It's frustrating, isn't it? - Jack. - You could save him... ...if you could get to him. I know you know CPR. But those wires are live, Tru. Barbecue Tru. You say you're on the side of good, and yet you stand there enjoying this. You think I'm enjoying this, George? George isn't talking. You knew that was his name, right? I don't think you did. But maybe that's a good thing. Maybe it's easier when it's someone you don't know and care about. No, it isn't. I'm sorry it's a day late. You don't have to act surprised. Did I tell you about the symbology? Two hats, two jobs. - It seemed clever at the time. - Yes. And it's a wonderful thought, Davis. But I'm starting to think I can't handle med school and this. Tru, we were both wrong. It's just that now with Jack involved, it's harder. He's good. He's better than good. He knows stuff. Jack wasn't at the party before the rewind... ...and yet he knew about Lexi and Avery's fight. And he knew enough to make Carrie look likely too. How does he know this stuff? Yeah, that's what I thought. Thanks for my hats anyway. You're welcome. Go on, get to school. Prove you can do both. - Avery, hi. - Hey, good party last night. I looked for you after my little blowup with Lexi, but I couldn't find you. - How's Jensen? Have you guys talked? - Yeah. I think I'm forgiven. But you have to have your own conversation with him... ...because we both looked at her file. - Right. Even though you did do everything you could... ...to keep me from looking at anybody's file. There's no way I could've known what was in there. I know, but you did. And when you miss class, you know what we talked about. Like details and who asked what questions. That kind of thing. I didn't realize that. Weird. Yeah. It's cool. I just wanted you to know that I noticed. So go. Talk to Jensen. Okay. I'm sorry. It's fine. I told you about what was in someone else's records. That's not fine. Lexi's the one that lied. She wanted to marry a doctor. And she settled for me... ...because I think I might be the last guy in the country who marries a girl... ...just because she gets pregnant. - I like that you're that guy. I guess I'm happy that I found out when I did, you know? You don't look happy. You look like you miss her. No. No, I don't think that's it. I think that... I think I miss the girl that I was hoping she was. Witty, charming, that cared about what it is that I did... ...but also had her own stuff. You know, things that she cared about. Friends that she cared about. You'll find that person. We all have to believe... ...that there's someone out there that... The right person for us. Sure. There's the right person for everybody. Okay. Well, as soon as I get that... - Hey, you're leaving? - No, I can talk for a minute. Um, I wanted to thank you for last night. I was really glad that you were there. I was scared, and you made me feel safe. And that's a good thing. About the kissing? - I felt like I was crossing a line there. - Davis, that was a good thing too. - Really? - Yes. Oh. - I'm sorry, I have to run. - No. Yeah. No problem. Okay. You should know that I thank whatever force in the universe brought me to you. I like this place. It is a lot better than the dive where we first met. Anything is better than that place. Stale peanuts and watered-down liquor. - I got you a beer. - Thank you. - Long day yesterday? - About 40 hours. But it was easy. All I had to do was a little misdirection. - How about you? - Not bad. I got to know Davis a little better.
