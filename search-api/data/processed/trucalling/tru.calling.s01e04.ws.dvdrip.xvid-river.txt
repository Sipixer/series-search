[Light bulb flickering] [Tense instrumental music] [Tense instrumental music intensifies] DAVlS: There you are, Tru. Can you do me a favor? TRU: Yeah, sure. DAVlS: Hand me the other bulb. TRU: Can l ask you a question, Davis? DAVlS: Absolutely. Do you like it here? DAVlS: Been here eight years. Not sure what else l'd do. But do you like it here? ls everything okay? Doesn't it ever get to you... seeing all these dead people day after day? Yeah. Sure, l guess some days l wish l was in Ear, Nose and Throat... but most of the time, it's okay. My friend Lindsay works in public relations. So do we. Our public just happens to be dead. Here's what l think, Tru. DAVlS: We're all someplace for a reason. Just sometimes we need to accept what that reason is. [Slow instrumental music] [Harrison grunts] [Alternative rock music] [Alternative rock music intensifies] [Alternative rock music continues] [Grunting and moaning] [Theme music] [Tense instrumental music] [Gunshot firing] [Phone ringing] [Vase shattering] Damn. TRU: Hello? HARRlSON: <i>Hey, sis.</i> Sorry. Were you sleeping? TRU: <i>It's fine.</i> l have to wake up in 12 hours anyways. l wanted to make sure we were still on for brunch today at your place. -Yeah, absolutely. -Great. See you then. But-- l got to go. Battery's dying. See you, Tru. [Sighing and moaning] -So, you think she'll like me? -Listen, l told you, Tru is the best. But she has been tough on some of the girls l bring around. There's been others? But none that matters. Sounds like a line. The same one you used to get me in bed in the first place. HARRlSON: Serious. When l think of all the other girls l wasted time with... thinking, you know, she's the one, but.... HARRlSON: Then l meet you. SARAH: You'll jinx it. HARRlSON: Superstitious? Just about certain things. Parking, love. ls that what we're talking about here? Love? l'm gonna hit the showers... make sure l look presentable for your overprotective sister. Come here. What is that? SARAH: What? HARRlSON: On your back. Let me see that. lt's nothing, really. l slipped when l was working out. -You slipped? -Yeah. This had nothing to do with-- SARAH: No, this had nothing to do with anything. Just a... clumsy girl on a StairMaster. [Slow pop music] He tried to pick me up. -l did not try to pick you up. -Then what would you call it? lt was a diner. You were alone, l was alone. -l was just trying to make conversation. -You tried to pick her up. Anyway, l wouldn't talk to him. Not some stranger who was way too cute to be good for me. But he was persistent. He got my number, called, called again. Finally, l agreed to meet him for lunch. That was three weeks ago. And the rest is history. TRU: <i>My brother's in Iove.</i> -Already? l thought he just met her. -He did. The boy moves fast. God, l hate people in love. They always act so superior. So they found someone that will actually put up with them. Speaking of, what's happening with James? Third date tonight, and you know what that means. The third-date rule. One of the great overlooked inventions of our time. LlNDSAY: Thank you. HOST: You're welcome. So, you gonna sleep with him? lt's the third date, Tru. Fish or cut bait. You believe in the third-date rule, don't you? l believe in you. So if you believe in it.... He's so sweet. A little shy. My God, you like him. TRU: l liked her. HARRlSON: Sarah. Really? TRU: Yeah, l thought she was great. HARRlSON: But? There's no buts. She's a keeper, Harrison. HARRlSON: Yeah. That's great, Tru. l mean, we both know how you can be a little tough on some of my girls. Let's be honest. You've had some winners. l'm not even talking about the stripper years. No, but Sarah, she's different, Tru. l don't know. l mean, when l'm with her, it's.... l'm better, you know? [Glass shattering] Nice. l'll tell you, her ex-husband's a real fool to let her get away. Wow, she's divorced? Yeah. The guy sounds like a real piece of work, too. But she believes in me. HARRlSON: Damn, l don't even believe in myself half the time. But here's this girl, this.... No, this woman... who thinks l'm someone special. [Man screaming] MAN: l love this girl! This is a weird night. We got to find somebody for you... because this whole third-wheel stuff? New. [Phone ringing] Hello? Hey, sweetie, how are you? [Suspenseful instrumental music] -What, now? -ls everything all right? No, don't worry, Sarah. l'll be right there. l'm sorry, got to go. -ls she okay? -Don't worry. Nothing l can't handle. But l'll call you later, okay? l promise. lt was awful. lt was awkward and fast. And afterwards, he wouldn't even look at me. He just made up some excuse... that he had to get up early the next morning... and ran out of my apartment. TRU: What did you do? LlNDSAY: <i>What couId I do?</i> l said goodbye and ate a tube of cookie dough. So, not only did l just have the worst sex of my life with a guy l really liked... but l also gained two pounds. Okay, you know what? l'm officially over the third-date rule. lt's just another male invention to get us into the sack. GARDEZ: Honey, l'm home. -l got to call you back. -Yeah, okay. GARDEZ: <i>9</i>1 1 took the call at 10:30. GARDEZ: The body was found in his ex-wife's house. GARDEZ: Bullet in the chest. lt's nice to know some people got a worse relationship than l do. GARDEZ: Bag that for me? TRU: Yeah. Andrew Webb, lives at the harbor. Nice. Should've spent some of that money on a bullet-proof vest. [Rhythmic instrumental music] [Slow, dramatic instrumental music] Oh, my God. TRU: Sarah. MAN: <i>I'II try pIaying President Truman.</i> ALE<i>X</i> TREBEK: <i>1979.</i> HARRlSON: [On machine] <i>Hey,</i> this is Harrison. Leave me a message. Hi, it's me again. l really need to talk to you... so just call me back as soon as you get this, all right? -Are you okay? -l'm fine. l mean, these people are such brainiacs. TREBEK: <i>...tropicaI fIowers.</i> LAD Y: <i>What are orchids?</i> TREBEK: <i>Correct.</i> l mean, the only questions l know are about <i>GiIIigan's IsIand.</i> TREBEK: <i>1972. Ken Howard</i> as this decIaration writer.... TRU: Hello? MERE: <i>Tru, it's Meredith.</i> Listen, l really need to reach Harrison. You haven't heard from him by any chance? Actually, l have. MERE: He's under arrest, Tru. TRU: <i>For what?</i> They haven't filed yet, but my guess is murder one. What? MERE: <i>They're saying that he kiIIed</i> his girIfriend's ex. Andrew Webb? -Yeah, that's the guy. How do you know? -His body just came in. But there's no way. Harrison could never kill someone. lt doesn't look good. His blood is in her living room. -His prints were on the gun. -Where is he now? They're taking him downtown. Listen, l got to run. -l'll call you when l know more. -Mere, wait. TRU: Gardez, l'm gonna need you to cover for me. Just tell Davis l'll be back as soon as l can. Are you okay? TREBEK: <i>This fIower's name</i> is an aIIusion.... l don't know yet. [Suspenseful instrumental music] [Crypt door opening] Not that l'm not cool with the whole concept... of corpses speaking to me... but if you were going to ask for my help... now would be the time. Help me. [Dramatic instrumental music] [Phone ringing] TRU: Hello? HARRlSON: <i>Hey, sis.</i> Were you sleeping? Harrison, l need you to listen to me, and listen carefully. TRU: l'm going to tell you something. HARRlSON: <i>Can this wait tiII brunch?</i> Wait, you're still having us for brunch, right? Yes, but something's gonna happen today. Something important. l know. You're meeting Sarah. Don't be such a drama queen. l got to go. Battery's dying. Harrison, no. Wait. [Fast-paced instrumental music] Help me. DAVlS: You're here early. By about...12 hours. l'm not staying. For someone who doesn't like it here, you sure are around a lot. You ever think that maybe you just belong here? l'll let you know in about 12 hours. lssues. [Fast-paced instrumental music continues] TRU: lt's Harrison. He's in trouble. MERE: <i>Harrison's aIways in troubIe.</i> You pulled me out of a meeting to tell me that? -Today's different. -Okay, l'll bite. How's today different? This is gonna sound strange... but do you think Harrison could ever kill someone? -What? What kind of question is that? -Do you? MERE: <i>He's our brother.</i> l mean, we haven't been that close over the years, but.... l just need you to be honest. Do you think Harrison could ever kill someone? Yes. [Fast-paced instrumental music ends abruptly] TRU: l don't think he would ever-- MERE: <i>What is this about?</i> Or is this just one of your crazy hypotheticaIs? Yeah. That's what it is. But look, l'm gonna need your help today, no questions asked. Okay, fine. But next time, not during meetings, okay? Right. l'll be in touch. You'll be in touch. [Slow pop music] HARRlSON: You're late. lt's a good thing l didn't return that spare key... or l'd have to shimmy up that drain pipe again. -l'm glad to see you. -Yeah, you, too. Feel free to let go any time. l want you to meet.... TRU: Sarah. SARAH: You must be Tru. -l've heard so much about you. -Mutual. You have a lovely place. These old buildings are just great. -Can l talk to you for one sec? -Come on. We just got here. Besides, there's nothing you can't say in front of Sarah. Okay. l ran into Andrew yesterday. Andrew? My ex-husband. Tru? Word? ln the future, two topics that are off-limits when meeting my new girlfriends: my exes and their exes. l need you to stay away from Sarah today. Man, you never change. Every girl l bring around, you find something wrong with. So, she's divorced. What is the big deal? Half the country is divorced. lt's nothing against her. lt's you that l'm worried about. HARRlSON: l'm a big boy. lf l get my heart stomped, l get my heart stomped. HARRlSON: You can't protect me forever. No, but l can protect you for today. Look, go to the movies, go play the horses, whatever. -But just stay away from her, please. -l don't get you sometimes. Which lately, has been most of the time. Just do this for me, okay? Just for today. Why do you always have to do things the hard way? Because l can. [Rhythmic instrumental music] [Seagulls cawing] Can l help you? l didn't realize anyone was here. l'm sorry. You're taking pictures of my home. You'll have to do better than that. We're putting together a book on the harbor. You know, sights and sounds, all that. ANDREW: A book? A book proposal, actually. l won't bore you with the details... but we wouldn't use any of the pictures without your permission. Your boat is just so beautiful. l'm sorry about the inconvenience. lt's got an inside, too. So, tell me about the book. Beer, wine? Can l get you something? Why do l think you're not interested in the book? Why do l think you're one of the more perceptive women l've met lately? She's very pretty. That's Sarah. l'm sure we have better things to talk about than my wife. -You sure you don't want a drink? -Sorry. l'm on the clock. But, it's nice to see divorce doesn't slow you down at all. Sarah and l aren't divorced. We're separated. -Sarah isn't your ex-wife? -No, she's my current wife. [Upbeat instrumental music] [Phone ringing] Hello? Where are you? l've been waiting for half an hour. l'm sorry. Something's come up. LlNDSAY: <i>I'II try</i> not to take that personaIIy. Look, l'll just call you tonight, then. Just remember one thing. The third-date rule was invented by men to try and get us into bed. Whatever you do, don't fall for it. SARAH: You take this overprotective-sister role pretty seriously l see. Why didn't you tell Harrison you're still married? He said you were tough. But l didn't think your blessing would require an interview... and a background check. l'm sorry. He's my little brother. Sometimes l get carried away. Look, just because we don't have signed divorce papers... doesn't make it any more of a marriage. Do you know anyone who would want to hurt your husband? People don't hurt Andrew. Andrew hurts them. [Slow instrumental music] l married him when l was young. Too young. Maybe that's why l thought it was my fault. That somehow l had done something wrong. SARAH: l deserved it. Deserved what? Call it what you want. Domestic violence, physical abuse. lt all hurts just the same. l finally got the courage to leave. l thought the hard part was over. lt took me a year to realize the hard part hadn't yet begun. He won't divorce you? No. Giving up control doesn't really appeal to Andrew. Which is why these make sense. l found them in the mailbox this morning. SARAH: No name, but it doesn't take a genius to know who sent them. Look, should l have told Harrison sooner that l was still married? Probably. l just didn't want to scare him off. He doesn't scare easy, you know? l know. That's what l love about him. Like it or not, l do love him. So do l. You tell me to stay away from Sarah, and you go and hassle her. You know she called me, near tears. She thinks you hate her. l don't hate her, Harrison. That's not what this is about. HARRlSON: Then what is it about? You have to trust me, okay? Trust that l know what l'm doing. Or maybe l don't. l don't know. You were making a lot more sense... when you thought dead people were talking to you. Thanks. And when did you become such a hypocrite? You sleep with your college professor... and you're all over me because l'm dating a woman who's separated. No, it's not about that. The reason she's not divorced, Tru, is 'cause she's scared to file. HARRlSON: Damn it, Tru. You know what l think? l think it's 'cause l'm happy. Yeah. 'Cause l met someone, and it kills you... that your pathetic little brother's having a better life than you. All this time you had me convinced that Meredith was the selfish one. But it's been you all along. TRU: Harrison, you're getting it all wrong. HARRlSON: Am l? lt seems to me for the first time, l'm getting it right. [Tense instrumental music] [Tense instrumental music continues] Let me guess. There's no book. l'd like to ask you a few questions, Mr. Webb. You better talk fast, because the police will be here shortly. ANDREW: You know, l should've known. -How much is Sarah paying you? -For what? To dig up dirt, to force my hand in granting her a divorce. Oh, God, you know we've been playing this game for months. And frankly, her lack of originality is beginning to surprise me. This is Andrew Webb at the harbor. l don't work for your wife. l'm here to help you. l have an intruder onboard. Help me with what? Live to see tomorrow. ls that a threat? No, it's not. But if l'm gonna help you, you must be honest with me. -Why are you having Sarah followed? -What? -Why won't you grant your wife a divorce? -Because she married me for my money. ANDREW: lf l give her a divorce, she gets half. lf l stay married, she gets what l give her. Oh, so you're punishing her. She's making me out to be the bad guy. That's brilliant. You know, she's smarter than l thought. ANDREW: Did she tell you that l beat her? -Are you saying that you didn't? -l have never hit Sarah. And l have never hit a woman. Now, why don't you just run along before l have to change my answer. ANDREW: Sarah! Sarah! Just tell me what happened. [Sarah crying and quivering] He came in here, and he was out of control. Did he hit you? HARRlSON: Did he-- SARAH: No. Not this time... but he threatened me. [Whispering] He threatened to kill me. What? Why? Because of you. Because he hates you. He hates me? What did l do? You made me fall in love with you. Maybe it would just be safer for me if we weren't together right now, okay? For both of us. Oh, l don't know, Harrison, you know. Then l'm just giving in to him. l'm giving him exactly what he wants. God, what can l do? He comes over here and l'm helpless to protect myself. Maybe you shouldn't be helpless. What are you saying? SARAH: l should take a self-defense class or go buy a gun? You wouldn't be helpless. [Slow instrumental music] HARRlSON: Look at me. l know a guy. SARAH: You know a guy? HARRlSON: Yeah. He could set you up today with a gun. -Do you love me? -You know l do. HARRlSON: Then trust me. l know a guy. OPERATOR: <i>91 1.</i> SARAH: <i>Yes, this is Sarah Webb.</i> OPERATOR: <i>Are you okay?</i> SARAH: <i>My husband just--</i> OPERATOR: <i>Speak up, ma 'am.</i> Your husband just what, ma 'am? SARAH: <i>Hit me.</i> I'm bIeeding. OPERATOR: <i>Is he there with you now?</i> SARAH: <i>No, he drove away.</i> SARAH: <i>PIease hurry, if he comes back,</i> he threatened.... SARAH: <i>He said he wouId kiII me.</i> OPERATOR: <i>Where are you?</i> SARAH: <i>Oh, my God, he's here.</i> Andrew, stop it. PIease. A friend of mine in the DA's office tracked it down from a year ago last December. He was lying. -What's that? -Nothing. Just thinking out loud. So, Harrison knows you're investigating his girlfriend? lt's for his own good, Mere. You gotta trust me. So what happened when the police showed up at her house? The husband was gone, the police issued a warrant for him. -And? -And nothing. Sarah went in the next day to make sure they dropped all the charges. -Why? -Classic battered woman syndrome. l see it all the time. lf you're done with your research project, l really have a ton of work to do. -Thanks, Mere. l owe you. -Yeah, you do. Well, if it's home protection you're looking for... l would say a semi-automatic, nine millimeter. -l sell a lot of those. -Nine millimeter, what does that mean? lt's the size of the bullet. lt's like what cops use. Of course there's a good argument to be made to stepping it up a bit... to 10 millimeter or 45. Both very good choices. What about this? Sure. lf your home's being invaded by grizzly bears. HARRlSON: The nine millimeter is fine. SERGE: Good choice. Does the little lady want me to wrap it up or is she gonna wear it home? l can't do this. Harrison, l'm sorry, l can't do this. Whoa, hey. HARRlSON: We talked about this. You need it. What does it solve? l mean, do you think that it gives me my life back? And besides, l read somewhere, what was it... that my own gun is more likely to be used against me. -Hey, you want me to hold it? -No, Harrison, it's-- 'Cause l will. You need it, but you don't want it in your house. So l'll keep it. Problem solved. And if he ever gives you a hard time... all you got to do is call me. l don't know. l've already gotten you so mixed up in all of this. We're in this together now. HARRlSON: Wrap it up, Serge. SARAH: God, l hate this. [Fast-paced instrumental music] l know you don't want to talk to me, but l need you to listen. HARRlSON: So, you wanted to talk to me? TRU: Please. Look, l'm sorry. About Sarah. For doubting her. l know her husband's a bad guy. l know everything. lt's cool. -That's big of you, Tru. l mean, that's-- -l'm not done. Because you're still in danger. Damn it, Tru. Why can't you leave well enough alone? You apologized. And now this. You know... have a great night. Hey, Harrison, wait. You're carrying a gun. Hey, yeah, don't give me any gun-safety lectures, l know my way around a piece. Oh, my God. Do you think Harrison could ever kill someone? MERE: <i>Yes.</i> You killed him. HARRlSON: What are you talking about? You're gonna kill him. You're gonna kill Andrew tonight. What are you talking about? Why would you say that? TRU: Because l know. HARRlSON: You know what? Every single thing that's gonna happen today. What are you, psychic all of a sudden? lt's not psychic. At least l don't think so. l mean, l'm not sure what the name for it is scientifically. But in layman's terms, l relive days. You relive days? People ask for my help. Dead people. l know, l already told you that. But then the day restarts... and l have a chance to save them from dying. lt doesn't happen every day. TRU: Not that that makes it any less strange, but.... How do you think l knew your card? Take this. How do you think l knew who was gonna win the ball game? -Even you were curious. -Okay, Tru, l love you, you know that. But you need help. A lot of it, okay? TRU: You see that waiter? ln two seconds, l bet you he drops his tray. HARRlSON: Oh, what are you talking-- TRU: And that guy across the room? HARRlSON: Tru-- He's gonna stand up and profess his love for his girlfriend. l love this girl! [Tense instrumental music] What's going on? ls this one of those reality shows where you try to freak a guy out? ln one minute, your cell phone's gonna ring. lt's gonna be Sarah. Upset and in trouble. Listen to me. She's gonna ask you to come see her. You're gonna run out of here, you're gonna kill her husband. You're gonna kill her husband and be arrested for his murder tonight. Look, you had me with the waiter, and lover-boy, okay? But this? This is a little wack, don't you think? [Phone ringing] [Phone continues ringing] Hello? lt's Sarah. Says she needs me. [Tense instrumental music] TRU: Harrison, wait. HARRlSON: l'm going, Tru. TRU: You can't. She needs me. l love her and she needs me. You can't save her. lt's not your responsibility. lf you go there tonight, you're gonna kill him. -But he deserves what he gets. -And then what? You end up where? ln jail for life, or worse? What? Do you want me to be like Dad? Stand by helplessly and watch the woman l love get murdered? ls that what you want? -Don't make her into Mom, either. -What? Harrison, she's not Mom. Don't make this about saving Mom. Look, l don't even know what you're talking about. Harrison. Look at me. Would you look at me? l'm 22 years old. And one way or another, l've lost everyone l've ever loved. Our mother to a bullet, our father to lack of interest... Meredith to coke and ambition. Don't you see? l can't lose you, too. Otherwise l'll have no one left. l'm cursed because l can see the future. And if you go there right now, l'll have no one. Without you, l am all alone. [lntense instrumental music] You will never lose me, Tru. But l have to go. l gotta go. Har... [Car tires screeching] TRU: Taxi. [Phone ringing] Hello. Thought you'd like to know, Andrew Webb was cited for speeding... on December 20 of last year. Actually, l don't think this is the best time. MERE: ln California. TRU: <i>So?</i> So, that's the same night that Sarah called <i>9</i>1 1 here. Remember, who actuaIIy saw Andrew that night? Only Sarah. The cops never found him. Why? Because he wasn't there. He won't divorce you? Oh, my God. She set him up. She's setting Harrison up. She married me for my money. Mere, let me ask you a question about divorce law. lf you divorce your husband in this state-- You get half community property. -And if you kill him? -You go to jail. What's this about? But if you have someone else kill him, you get it all... and the poor schmuck goes to jail. You said it was gonna be unlocked. l was surprised when you called me. l thought you couldn't stand being around me. Usually l can't. Except when my electrician is unavailable. Charming as always, Sarah. All right, your wiring looks fine. [Alternative rock music] How can you listen to this music? l can't even hear myself think. -Could you hear that? -No. l didn't hear anything, Andrew. [Security alarm beeping] Okay, l heard that. Andrew, be careful. -All right, just call the police. -Okay. [Grunting and moaning] Kill him, Harrison. Kill him or he'll kill us both. [Tense instrumental music] No. -l can't. -You're a coward. l may be... but, God, l'm not a killer. l can't do it. SARAH: You are now. Your blood is in my house, your prints are on the gun. Luckily, l was able to wrestle it away from you. Sarah. Take my advice and claim self-defense... although that would be hard to prove with you breaking in and all. OPERATOR: <i>91 1.</i> Yes, hi. l would like to report a murder. SARAH: My husband is dead. What is going on here? Conspiracy to commit murder, l'd say. l got the strangest phone call today. l know you don't want to talk to me, but l need you to listen. Some girl begged me to wear a bullet-proof vest. l would have protected you. You know that, right? Goodbye, Sarah. [Slow instrumental music] You should've taken half. [Police radio chattering] You know, l'm not sure l can buy that whole ''reliving a day'' thing. Can't say l blame you. But let's say that l did... if what you said is true. Do you think yesterday l killed him? l don't know. Maybe. Probably. TRU: How's your head? lt hurts. Like my pride. Of course, if you can really do what you say... l'll tell you, we've really turned a nice profit. [Up tempo instrumental music] l already did. [Up tempo instrumental music continues] LlNDSAY: <i>So, I took your advice.</i> We came back to my apartment, James and me. We just talked. TRU: <i>You just taIked?</i> LlNDSAY: Yeah. TRU: Good, Linds. l'm proud. LlNDSAY: <i>And you know what I reaIized?</i> That James is one boring guy. So l just slept with him. l figured that was one way to shut him up. TRU: And? LlNDSAY: <i>It was nice.</i> lt was very nice. We're going for sushi tomorrow night. Good thing l didn't take your advice, huh? Yeah. Good thing. Oh, you made it. l wasn't sure if you would. -You were right, Davis. -l was? About what? l think there is a reason l'm here. A good one. Yeah. l thought you might come around. MAN: <i>Presidents. $1,600.</i> TREBEK: <i>1979.</i> -Hey, Tru. -Hey, yourself. lt's a slow night. Not one pickup since lunch. GARDEZ: These guys are such brainiacs. The only questions l know are about <i>GiIIigan's IsIand.</i> What are orchids? LAD Y: <i>What are orchids?</i> FIowers. $1,600. What, a rerun? TREBEK: <i>...are sometimes known</i>
