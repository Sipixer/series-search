the graveyard shift, right? It's Jack's orientation. You have to show him around. Don't tell me you forgot. No, Davis, I didn't forget. I'm just running a bit late. Okay. She's running late. Okay, we can start over here. This is the digital autopsy capture. First we-- Scan the body with the camera for any visible signs of trauma... then enter the name and case number into the database. Right. Exactly. Okay. Over here, this is the live scan machine. Used to log fingerprints, flat panel to take hand impressions. - I read the manuals. - Good. I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have gotten up so early. Then we couldn't have spent this quality time together. And the truth is... - there are a couple of things I don't know. - Such as? Such as, do you like working here? The reason I ask is you don't look like your average morgue attendant. Yeah? And what do I look like? You look like a girl who takes things way too seriously. Someone who should be enjoying life... but probably spends Friday nights home alone watching TV... eating a microwave dinner. Should I bag the personals? I don't spend every Friday night at home. I mean.... Well, anyways, what do you do on Friday nights? Why don't you tell me? Well, you don't stay in. That's for sure, because that'd mean you'd be alone... and you're not a guy who's very keen on being alone. So you go out to a bar or a club. And after a few hours, you return home, sometimes solo... but usually with some nameless, faceless, shameless girl... who just doesn't understand you. But either way, by the end of the night... you're alone, in front of the TV, eating a microwave dinner. I don't own a microwave. But you still haven't answered my question. Do you like it here? Actually, I do. I understand. You do? Because not everyone does. That's because most people believe that only the living need help. Hand them over. Right now! - Can I help you? - You sure can. Open the safe under the counter and fill it up. We don't have a safe. Open it or she dies! Please do what he says! Now! Help me. - Harrison Davies? - Yeah. Are you Tru Davies' brother? Who wants to know? Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i> Right, Tru told me all about you. I have a couple of questions about your sister. She's been at a series of crime scenes. I was wondering if you've anything to say about that. Sorry, Michelle, I don't talk to the media. They tend to make me a little nervous, you know? But I'll tell Tru you were asking about her. Harry, what a surprise. You know me, I am full of them. This is my brother, Harrison. This is Jack. Jack Harper. Nice to meet you. You, too. You got a sec? Yeah. Check. I ran into that reporter, Michelle. And? Didn't say a word. The gunman Ieft the Lion's Lair Arcade at 2.:00 p. m... and reIeased a hostage shortIy after. We'II have more.... So, what's up? I just wanted to check in, make sure you're doing okay. Yeah, I'm fine. Why? The whole thing with Dad shooting the guy who killed Mom. Yeah, I'm dealing with it the best I can. You know, they haven't found the body. You gotta hand it to the old man. He really took care of things. So is that the only reason you stopped by? Well, now that you mention it... it's me and Lindsay's three- month anniversary. I'm shocked you remembered. I don't think it's a big deal, but it means a lot to her. So I booked reservations at Le Petite Fleur.... - Whatever it is she's talking about. - Good. She'll love that. The problem is I'm a little tapped out. But if you could float some cash my way... I can make sure that your best friend, Lindsay... has a night that she'll never forget. Lucky it's payday. Here. Pretty expensive restaurant. Of course, I should valet the car. - Yeah, street parking. Not a problem. - Get out. Yeah, I'm going. You are the best. And they're off. That's it, baby! Go! Come on, Eight Ball! Hold on! Come on, Eight Ball. Come on, go! Now Aidan's Luck swings up on the outside. Do it for daddy, baby! Come on. It's Eight BaII bringing to a narrow Iead. And here comes Aidan's Luck. Just trying to parlay some cash to bring the old lady out to a nice dinner. Eight BaII, Aidan's Luck neck- and- neck. No! As they hit the finish Iine, Aidan's Luck by a nose. - Looks like you guys are eating in. - God. No, that's cool. I still got one more race, win it all back. So, what do you think of Hodge Podge and Nightcap? Not much. Look, I'm going with Deep Shaker. Deep Shaker? He's 20- to- 1. Lots of luck with that, pal. Hey, Tru. What's up? I just wanted to say thanks for giving up your afternoon... - to come in here and help me. - It's no problem. - So we're okay, you and me? - Yeah, why wouldn't we be? I just want to make sure. I didn't want to come off like a know- it- all. - No, you didn't. Perfectly, well-- - Hey, Tru. Oh. Luc, hi. This is Jack, the new forensics assistant. Luc's a crime scene photographer. - Nice to meet you. - Same here. So.... So, how have you been? Fine. - Busy. - Me, too. You always are. Speaking of busy, I.... You know, head back. Well, I'll see you around. See you, Jack. Nice to meet you. You, too. So how long did you two date for? What? Come on, I saw it. The long lingering looks, the unfinished sentences. - What are you talking about? - I think it was about two months. And then things got complicated, and you broke up. Only, now you're wondering if you did the right thing... or just the easy thing. Okay, yeah, something like that. Now's the part where you're gonna lay into me... for being that girl who's way too serious, right? No. I was gonna tell you I'm sorry things didn't work out the way you wanted. - How did it go with Jack? - Good, I think. Did he mishandle equipment? What did he do? No, nothing like that. He's a smart guy. He knows his stuff. I just can't get a read on him, for some reason. It's like one minute he's in your face and almost obnoxious. The next, he's charming, trying to be your best friend. He's just trying to get acclimated, you know. You remember your first few days here? Besides, we need the extra help, especially with your other job. Yeah, I guess. Anyway, I've got to run. I will see you tonight. - Tonight? - Yeah, Luc's show. What show? - Never mind. - Davis. Okay. Luc is having a photography show at some gallery. I'm sure it's no big deal. I was only invited at the last minute. No, it's fine. I mean, it's totally fine. We broke up, and I'm working tonight anyway. - Did I mention it's fine? - Yeah, three times. - Well, it is. It's completely and totally-- - Fine. You didn't have to go to all this trouble for just three months. Although I'm so glad that you did. I can't wait to order dessert. They have this amazing chocolate soufflé here. Is everything okay? Who? What's that? Nothing. It just looks like you're planning an escape or something. Oh, my God. Here, drink some water. - Sir, are you all right? - Oh, my God! A bone? - This was in my veal. I almost choked! - I'm terribly sorry, sir. - Let me get you another dish. - Another dish? And another bone? I don't think so, pal. I'm sure the maitre d' will take your meal off the bill. - My meal? What about hers? - Harrison, it's fine. You're fine. We're happy to pay for my meal, and thank you for everything. Harrison, sit down. A fish bone? You ordered veal, you idiot. Let me guess. You don't have any money, do you? It's just one more chapter in the Harrison Davies book of disappointments. Who would've thought that Deep Shaker would have won? It was a 20- to- 1 shot. 20- to- 1! In what is amounting to a crime spree... In what is amounting to a crime spree... the gunman once again used a customer as a human shieId... when he heId up the Pharsyde CIothing Store shortIy after 6.:00 p. m. The fact there were no security.... Hey, Linds, how was dinner? Great. Until your brother pretended to choke on his entrée. What? Trying to get his meaI comped... because he blew his money at the track today. You're joking, right? I know his heart's in the right pIace... but I really think I'm at the end of my rope with him. He's my brother and I love him, but.... Anything you need? Besides a chocolate soufflé? Look, I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Bye. Harrison. Is your brother in trouble? Sorry, I couldn't help overhearing. Is everything okay? Just family stuff. Siblings. They can get to you like no one else. You have brothers and sisters? I had a sister. She died a couple of years ago. I'm so sorry. Thanks. That's nice of you. But I really feel like she went to a better place. I know it sounds cIiché... but I really believe it's true. She was sick, and then she wasn't. Anyway, I know what you're going through with your brother. You feel like he's your responsibility. Tell me about it. Still, sometimes you gotta let them make their own mistakes. Learn the hard way, you know? Speaking of mistakes.... I had this soup from the vending machine. Forgot about that on your tour. Anywhere around here a guy can get some edible food? Yeah, the diner two blocks up isn't bad. I was gonna get some takeout. - I'll get you something. - Only if I can pay. Sounds like a deal. - Pickup for Davies. - A couple more minutes. Okay, I'll be right over there. Hello, Tru. - Do I know you? - Michelle Carey. We almost spoke on the phone a couple of times. I've got nothing to say to you. I ran into your brother today. He wouldn't talk to me, either. You've been dodging my calls for over a month now. I'm sure your boss told you about our chat? He also told me that he kicked you out of the office. Aborted suicides, murder attempts, near accidents. All these rescues. What have you to say about showing up each time before the police do? Or the fact that your mother did the same thing? What are you talking about? Where are you getting all this? Doesn't matter. Now is the time to give your side of the story... or you'll read about it in the paper next weekend. I'll go to print whether I get a quote from you or not. Order's up. At first I thought you had some sort of hero complex. Setting up these near misses so you could rescue people just in time. - But you never took any credit. - There's nothing to take credit for. No one moves or she dies! Empty the register. Quick! This guy hit two other places today. He took a hostage each time, then let them go. Everyone shut up! Fill it up. I am not kidding. I'll kill her if you don't! Police officer! Drop the gun! Somebody get us some help, hurry! It's gonna be okay, Michelle. Here. Hang on, Michelle. Someone call 91 1, please! Hang on, Michelle. It's gonna be okay. Come on. Hurry, please! God, no. Is she.... Yeah. I need you. - Hello? - Tru, are you up? - Because it's Jack's orientation today. - Tell him I'll be right there. Again. Tru, to be honest, this doesn't set a good example. - Sorry, I didn't mean to keep you waiting. - It's okay, I'm not busy. Good. Then, Davis, can I talk to you for one sec? In your office? - Okay. - Be right back. I'll be here. Michelle, the reporter, is the one who asked for help? Unfortunately. But not before she had all these questions about me saving people. Was there anyone else hurt? The gunman grabbed a customer who was wounded in the crossfire. Then he dragged her out with him. Now you must try to save the woman trying to expose you. Jeez Louise, talk about irony. What do you know about the gunman? Apparently, he was going on some sort of crime spree today. This guy hit two other places today. ...he heId up the Pharsyde CIothing Store shortIy after 6.:00 p. m. Three places in five hours: an arcade, a clothing store, and then the diner. And each time, he uses a customer as a shield. - That worries me. - Davis, you're always worried. No. The fact that Michelle's the one that died concerns me. Some people are fated to die before their time. And I believe that some people are fated to lead to the death of others. If you wind up back at the diner with her... fate could be altered enough where someone else could get shot. Not to mention that if you save her, you're exposed: who you are, what you can do. You've got to call the cops, Tru. If you can get the gunman arrested at either of the other two places... he'll never make it to the diner. Michelle will be safe and so will you. - Okay, fine. I'll do it. - And then.... You will? That was easy. - I thought you were gonna call the cops. - I am. I need to make sure the cops get this guy, so that Michelle's safe. Listen to me for a minute. Look, I know that you're good at what you do. - But that doesn't mean I can't worry. - That means a lot, Davis. Just keep your cell on at Luc's show. I may need you. Yeah, maybe I'll see you there later. Actually, I wasn't invited. Don't worry. I'll call you later. What about that tour? A little personal business. But I'll give you an orientation later this afternoon. Tru's a busy girl. Yeah, she's got a lot of hobbies. - What's the rush? - I think it's sweet... that you remembered your three- month anniversary, but I'm not giving you money. Why would you think that? Why.... Why do reliving days suck for me? So, what did I do? You lost everything I gave you at the track. So you're gonna have to be more creative. And I'm gonna do you an even bigger favor today. I'll borrow your car so you can't go to the track at all. - No, wait-- - I gotta go. Go on. Save everybody but me. I gotta get a job. No. You look a little lost there, bud. Everything okay? - You'll have to ask my sister. - You must be Tru's brother. - I'm Jack, the new guy. - Harrison. What's up? You sure everything's okay? Yeah, it's nothing. My girl wanted to go out for the anniversary, you know. I was gonna take her to a nice dinner, but I'm all tapped out, so.... Well, what do you usually do to score some quick cash? I bet the horses. - But I don't even have start- up cash-- - I love the track. Why don't we go together and I'll spot you a few bucks? - Get out of here! - I got some time till orientation. Let's go. Sweet, because if we hurry, we can still make the daily double. Check it out. I need to talk to someone about a potential robbery. HoId, pIease. Come on. Desk Sergeant Cooper. How can I help you? Someone I know is gonna commit a robbery today. An armed robbery. Someone you know? - What's your name, miss? - I'd rather not say. This person you know give any specifics as to time or place? The Lion's Lair Arcade on Fifth around 3:00. Okay, I'll bite. What does this armed man look like? No one moves or she dies! Mid 20s, about 6' tall, short black hair. He wore....I mean, he's wearing an orange T- shirt under a gray jacket. Okay, we'll send an officer to check it out. Thank you. Please hurry. What's up, Frankie? Give me $20 on the 2 horse. Two seconds. What's the matter? Second thoughts? I must have lost when I bet the horse yesterday. What are you talking about? No, Tru told me that I didn't.... I mean, that the horse didn't.... The horse won't do well. I've only known Tru for a short period of time... but she doesn't strike me as an expert on the ponies. She's not. She's.... Tru is lucky, man. So am I. So go with me and bet the 7 horse. - Aidan's Luck? - Aidan's Luck loves this track. Three- for- three at this distance. Right. Forgot about that. Sorry about that. Had to have a quick powwow with my new consultant over there. Give me $20 on lucky 7, to win. Hand them over. Right now! Everything okay? Fine, sir. No problem here, Officer. Can I get some change for the parking meter? See anything out of the ordinary today? Besides half my clientele? No. Give us a call if you have any problems. They must have seen the cops. Hey, Davis? You think you'll be able to make it tonight? - Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. - Great. It's my first show... and I'm afraid the photos are gonna outnumber the people. I know that Tru's really excited about going. She loves photography and photo stuff. Actually, I didn't invite Tru. Really? I had no idea. I thought she's got a lot going on. I didn't think she'd have the time. Look, I'm no expert on successful relationships... or any relationship, for that matter. But let me just say this. Sometimes people will surprise you. Wh- What? Unit 47, what's your status on that 2- 11 at the Lion's Lair Arcade? This is McLain. That 2- 11's a negative. 10- 4. Some nut just called in a false alarm. The premises were checked. It's all clear. AII right, 10- 4. We got you back in service. If that woman calls again, you let her know... that the faIse reporting of a crime is a feIony. WiII do. 10- 4. What are you up to? The gunman never showed up, so the robbery never happened. You altered the day. He must have cased the place. Saw the cops and took off. Right. - There's just one problem. - The guy's still out there. Right, and his crime spree is still on track. I have no assurance that Michelle's gonna be safe. It might be time for another anonymous tip. You gonna bail me out after they lock me up? Sorry, it's up to me now. I've gotta head to that second location. - No, it's too dangerous. - Davis, I can't turn my back on fate. Who knows what could happen? I have to do this. Okay, but I want you to take this. - A St. Benedict medal. - It's for protection. Many people believe that it ensures... no harm will come to the body or soul that possesses it. It was given to me a Iong time ago... and I like to think that it's kept me safe ever since. I'm gonna be just fine, D. I hope so. - Hey. - Hey. - I'm just-- - I know, on your way out the door. Hey, Tru. I know you're busy and this is kind of last- minute... but if you get some time tonight, I'd love for you to come to my show. Thanks. I'll try. - I'll keep my hopes up. - Bye. Thank you, Aidan's Luck. 2, 3, 4, 5. And thank you. I don't know what I would've done without you. No, actually, I do. I wish Tru could see this. Teach her to have a little faith in her baby bro. What's with your sister, anyway? She's a little overprotective of you. She can't help it. You know, ever since our mom died and the old man bailed... she kind of looks over the family. Maybe that's why she seems like she has the weight of the world on her shoulders. Yeah, she's got a lot of other stuff going on. Like what? More than you could imagine, my friend. I got a pretty big imagination. Well, she's... She's one- of- a- kind. But enough about her. More importantly, who do you like in the next race? You're not gonna like it. Deep Shaker. What? He's 20- to- 1. He likes the outside on a dry track. Could be his day. And if you win this bet, you'll have enough money for six anniversary dinners. Deep Shaker? $20 to win. Don't do it. I know what you're gonna do. You're gonna grab someone and try and hold this place up. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Listen. You haven't done anything yet. Didn't hit the arcade because of the cops. - Stop before someone gets hurt, or worse. - Who are you? Does it matter? Get out of my way. Don't go out there. The guy that just left has got a gun. - Sorry, but I'm in a rush. - Didn't you hear what I said? Morgue. Davis, you're not gonna believe this. Honestly, nothing at this point surprises me. He tried to hit the clothing store. I stopped the robbery but he escaped. What about the hostage? That's just it. There isn't one. He isn't taking a different hostage each time. It's the same girl at every location. - They're a team. - Just like Bonnie and Clyde. Kind of, except in this case, Clyde uses Bonnie as a fake hostage. That's an interesting twist. I should've known when he took her from the diner after she got shot. She wasn't a shield. He wouldn't leave her because-- They're in it together. Right. You've been busy today. - Feel like telling me what's going on? - Michelle. I see we don't need to be formally introduced... - even though I haven't met you. - I recognize your voice. Really? You've harassed my phone machine enough times. If you'd just talk to me, maybe I'd stop. Today's not the day. It's the perfect day. You're calling in false alarms, chasing people out of clothing stores. Just another typical day in the life of Tru Davies. I checked police logs, auto track records. Your name pops up everywhere. In fact-- Michelle. You don't want to be around me today. I want your answers, Tru. I'm not going anywhere until I get them. - Okay, meet me tonight. - Time and place? 8:00 sharp at the morgue. Just please promise me you'll wait until I get there? I'll be there. And this better be good. Believe me, it's good. Did you get all that? Yeah. She'll be at the morgue at 8:00. Make sure she waits until I get there. That way, we can ensure she stays alive. Even if she isn't at the diner, someone could still get hurt. It's my job. It's a chance we're gonna have to take. I'II caII you Iater. - Did I hear someone mention the diner? - No, I was talking to Tru. Is she getting takeout? 'Cause I could really use a burger. No, she has her hands full. Before we got there, I'm thinking to myself... it's gonna be canned soup and crackers for us. Jack, he's turned me in the direction of this long shot. I'm a little dubious, mind you, but Jack said: "If this horse wins, you can buy six anniversary dinners." Are you gonna eat the rest of this? Deep Shaker was a 20- to- 1 shot. But Jack had a feeling. And boy, did he ever have a feeling! I'm talking about $400 worth of feelings. I have an idea. Why don't I leave so you can have dinner with Jack? What? Never mind. What a day, what a night, and it ain't over. Where are you going, chief? For your little lady. Thank you, sir. No, you ought to thank Jack. Drop the gun! Everyone shut up! You're a policeman, right? I'm off-duty, ma'am. Is there something I can do for you? I hope so. Hello? Hello? Can I help you? Hi, I didn't see you there. Michelle Carey, <i>Post Dispatch.</i> Sorry, I subscribe to the <i>Times.</i> I'm not peddling subscriptions. I'm looking for Tru Davies. Yeah. Davis said she's at the Standard Diner down the block. Really? She's supposed to meet me here at 8:00. - I'm sure she's on her way back. - I'm not. Why don't you just pop in on her? It's just out the door, two blocks down on your right. Thanks. I think I will. I don't know who tipped you off... but I don't see the blonde woman you described... let alone some guy holding up the place. I don't understand. They should be here by now. Things couldn't have changed that much. I can't believe you're not gonna do this. That girl knew we were gonna be at the arcade and the clothing store. - It was a coincidence. Bad luck. - She knows we're together. She has no idea who we are... and there's no way in hell she knows we're gonna hit this diner. - Unless you talked to somebody, Charlie. - You think I'm nuts? Why would I tell anyone about this? Look, this is getting out of hand, Beth. This was supposed to be just the two of us having a few kicks... grabbing some quick dough without anyone getting hurt. Who's gotten hurt, Charlie? - No one, but-- - Exactly. No one. We promised each other that the minute there was any trouble... - we're gonna back off. - Meanwhile, we haven't seen a dime. As for kicks, we haven't got much there, either. Later, hon. Sorry, but you're gonna miss all the fun. Beth! Beth! Looks like your friend gave you a bogus tip. - It wouldn't be the first time. - Sorry to have troubled you. Better to be safe than sorry. You leaving already? Because if you'd like to join me for dinner.... Sorry, but I've got another crisis waiting for me back at the office. And unfortunately, this one's gonna show up. Did a reporter come here looking for Tru? Long dark hair, mid- to- late 20s? Yeah, Michelle something. About 10 minutes ago. I told her Tru was at the diner and she took off. 8:00 at the morgue? - I was just gonna pick up some dinner. - Eating light? Look, you can't even begin to understand what's been going on today. Oh, no. - Wait right here. I'll be right back. - Like that's gonna happen. Wait for me at the morgue. It's for your own good, believe me. Okay, but you better show. Give me the money right now! Don't do this. You. Police officer! Drop the gun! I don't know what you're doing here, but just shut up! - Get in the booth. - It's not gonna end well. Now! All right, let's have it right now. Drop it right now! Hurry up! Put the gun down and no one gets hurt. All right. I leave, she lives. Simple as that. No one's been hurt yet but that could change. In fact, I could almost guarantee it's going to. Just let it go, miss. - What if she gets shot? What if she dies? - Just shut up! Everyone knows what you look like. You'll end up alone in prison for the rest of your life. Is that what you want? No, she doesn't. Please, Beth. You gotta stop. We never wanted to hurt anyone. This isn't what we do. We're not criminals. We're not even good at it. How else could she have been on to us all day? And if she is... - the cops can't be far behind. - Actually, there's one right there. Beth, please, let this woman go. Put down the gun and kick it to me. Drop the gun! Over here. Police! Put the gun down! I'm from 64 Precinct. Badge number 83049. Police! How'd you get here so quick? Got a 91 1 call from the Coroner's Office about a holdup in progress. Said he was worried about his friend here. So, Harrison spent a fortune on dinner. He did? Yep. He also spent the entire evening talking about his new track buddy named Jack. No kidding? Why do I feeI if a coupIe of Iong shots hadn't come in... I would've had frozen pizza instead of a soufflé? I won't try and convince you otherwise. You gonna be all right? - Yeah. Ask me in the morning. - Okay, good night. I think you owe me an explanation. God, I've had it with you! It's not enough I just saved your ungrateful.... - Okay, you want the truth? - That's all I ever wanted. Turn on that tape recorder. Yesterday, I went to the diner. You were following me, just like you did today. - Yesterday? I didn't go-- - You want to hear this or not? There was a holdup at the diner. You were shot and killed. After you died, you asked for my help. The day rewound, and now I'm reliving yesterday. What? In order to keep you from dying, I had to try and prevent a crime spree... which you tipped me off on yesterday. And thanks for that, by the way. But you ended up at the diner anyway, because that's how fate wanted it. So now you want me to think you're just plain nuts? Nice try, but it's not gonna work. I don't know exactly what happened back there... but you and I aren't done. Luc, hey. Yeah. Your show. I wanted to be there. I really did. - It's just my day wouldn't end. - Tru, you don't have to explain. I invited you because I wanted you there, not because I thought you would be. It's okay, really. Well, how did it go? Pretty good. Had a decent turnout. Sold two prints. - It was a good night for me. - That's good. I'm glad. You know, I thought for a while that maybe I could change our fate... but I guess fate's one thing you just can't change. Thank God. It's okay, Davis. I'm in one piece. And Michelle lives to see another day. I'll reserve judgment whether that's a good thing or not. So did the medallion keep you safe? No, Davis. It was you who kept me safe. You called the police. It's the least I could do after letting Michelle out of my sight. Anyway, thanks. No. No, that's, uh... That's yours to keep. I appreciate it. Thanks, D. Yeah. One thing. I'm in danger all the time. I mean, dodging bullets, chasing bad guys. But today, the medallion, making me call the police. Why were you so worried about me today? Well, for one, there was Michelle. But the truth is... I worry about you every day, Tru. Today I just wanted to help. You have a fun day at the races? Actually, we did. Your brother's a pretty cool guy. I happen to think so, too. Just not sure why you had to go to the track to figure that out. Don't worry so much. Harrison's a big boy. He can take care of himself. Besides, he won, didn't he? Well, I'm his sister. I know Harrison a lot better than you do and what's best for him. Maybe so.
