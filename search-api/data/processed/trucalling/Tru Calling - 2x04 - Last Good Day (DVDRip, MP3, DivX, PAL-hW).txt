Then the rest of the day is mine. That is excellent, because I have two tickets to the Blue Spot... ...the Scott Rogo Quintet. - Uh, Jensen, I'm sorry, but I hate jazz. - Me too. - Lexi's the one that wanted to go. - Oops. Hey, tell you what, I bet you we could get 50 bucks for them in the parking lot. - I've never been scalping. - Swing by after class. - Hey, Harr. - Guess what. Oh, you'll never guess. Unless it's day two, in which case you're probably gonna tell me about it. - Harrison, I have class in 90 seconds. - <i>Fine.</i> One of Dad's clients says his partner's ripping him off. We got a tip... ...the partner's guys are moving a load of hot electronics tonight. And he needs pictures. I'm the shutter man. - It's not dangerous, is it? - Only if I screw it up. You're not gonna screw up. You're gonna be great. Aw. That'd mean more to me on a day two, but thanks for the effort. Bye. Okay. I have waited a week, so to the hell with the rules... ...somebody has got to ask somebody out for a date. How about dinner? - Now? It's 9:30 in the morning. - Actually, I was thinking of later tonight. Yes. Oh, yeah, of course, yes. And yes. Yes. Great. I'll cook. Can we use your place, though? - Uh... - My stove refuses to cooperate. Okay, yeah, I just have to leave a little early to tidy up. - I'll see you at 7. - Okay. Seven o'clock. I should probably leave now. I always wanted to learn the guitar. You know, I've seen you before. A bunch of times, really. You work around here? - Uh, yeah. All over the city, actually. - I'm not stalking you. It's just... I know this is kind of out of nowhere, but, um, I'm playing hooky today. And I have two tickets to see this jazz quintet... ...at the Blue Spot tonight. If you're not too booked up... ...maybe you'd like to come with. I can't. Work's a killer. Maybe some other time. Two tickets to the jazz festival. Do I hear 20? Twenty? - No, I don't hear 20. - Do I hear 15? Do I hear 10? Hey, we have the perfect date. We just have to run... We've got the perfect date? - For $20. For two? - Seriously, $5. I'll pay you. Oh, you're back. No? - You made all this in my kitchen? - I did. Don't you cook? Uh, I've made gazpacho a couple of times, but nothing like this. Mmm. This is delicious. Mmm. What is this? Tuna Provencal. Mmm. - What? What's wrong? - Nothing. It's just the mercury levels are kind of high and... It's probably what gives it the extra tang. - Wine's good. Yeah. That's good wine. - Relax. - It's just me. - I know, I'm sorry, it's just... I'm nervous. Nervous because this is the first time that a woman... ...has cooked here for me, and it's... I totally get it. But, you know, maybe... ...tonight'll turn out to be an evening full of first times. Oh. Oh, God, I'm such an idiot. I thought it was a dog. Coogan takes a hit. Then another. Smile for the birdie, suckers. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the way it was supposed to go. I bet Coogan wishes he hadn 't bothered showing up tonight, Bob. And he goes down. Coogan goes down. It's all over. Billy. I tell you, folks. Somebody... Somebody should've seen this coming. And it's official. Coogan is out, and the challenger... You're kidding me, that's awful. What did you do, just throw away the film? What was I supposed to do? I've known Billy since high school. If I didn't have a job with Dad... ...I'd be loading the truck up with him. - What did you tell Dad? I lied. I told him the light was bad and the shots were underexposed. Oh, God, he was pissed. Look, I don 't know if I can do it. I'm taking pictures of my friend. You're doing great, Harrison. Look, no one ever said it would be easy. Oh, it doesn't have to be easy, Tru. I just wish it wasn't so hard. - I know. - Anyway, I gotta go. Bye. - Six sugars, right? - Seven, but I'll live. Oh, it's fantastic, Avery. Thanks for calling. I just won a bunch of money on the Coogan fight in the med-school pool. - Ten bucks on Montez turned into 100. - Wow. - Yeah. - Boxing, scalping, gambling. Don't let the GPA fool you. I'm a gangster. Holler back. Yeah. Operation Seduce Davis did not go as planned. I don't know. I think I may have come on too strong. What happened? I tried to let him know that I was interested in him, you know, physically. - And he didn't respond? - No, he responded. Like I goosed him with a cattle prod. Some guys just need a little warming up. No! - Call you back. - Okay. And I was thinking that maybe you and I should, uh... ...you know, get together on Saturday. And scalp <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> tickets? Yeah, that's exactly what I had in mind. She jumped. I'll call 911. I saw the whole thing. She jumped from the very top. Somebody call 911. - Who was with her? - She just jumped. Jack. Help me. - What the hell was that? - What the hell was that? Help me! It was different. It didn't feel like a normal rewind at all. - As bizarre as that sounds. - No one asked for help, you're sure? There were no corpses lying around if that's what you mean. - Well, maybe you didn't hear it. - I always hear it. Well, do you think maybe you died? Okay, now you're just creeping me out. Okay, what were you doing when it happened? I was about to... ...do something personal. Okay. Describe the rewind. What did you see? Like I said, it was weird. It was just, like, random stuff. There was a painting. There was a music poster. There was a guitar case. There were coins. And there was a $20 bill, like a... In the case. It was a street performer or something. There's always a bunch like that at Atlantic Plaza. That was the last thing I saw. It was the clock on the Edison Tower. It was 11: 15, and the clock, it was moving away, like I was falling. - Tru, I'm... This may be a little crazy... - What? Well, maybe that's how the victim died. Falling off the Edison Tower. Maybe. There is an observation deck. But, Davis, we're not even sure there was a victim. - I wonder if anyone actually died. - I hate this. Right when I thought I had the right approach to this. The rules have changed. I mean, we're in open water now. This rewind... ...it felt bad. Cold. Like a part of me was dying. All I know is I never wanna feel that way again. I never felt anything like it. I don't know what to tell you. I've never heard of anything like this before. - She asked me for help. - Don't get knocked off track here. Doing the right thing is always harder. But if the rules changed this time, it's for a reason. Your job has always been clear. Make today end like yesterday. What the hell am I supposed to do? Your job. Harrison, wait. Oh, no, no. No, it's one of those days, right, where l... Relax. You don't die or anything. - Oh, whew. Cool. - I tried to call you on your cell... ...but I wanted you to know. Dad's gonna give you some big assignment. To photograph a crime taking place. - Very cool. - Your friend Billy's one of the criminals. You take pictures, he could go to jail. Not cool. Because if I don't, then I'm gonna be in trouble with... - Dad! - Hey. - What a pleasant surprise. - Hey. You feel all right, sweetie? You look tired. Well, you know how it goes, Dad. I work in a morgue. I only get a day off if death takes a day off. Carrie, it's day two and here's the headline: At your dinner tonight with Davis, take it down a notch. Go easy. Don't be easy. You know what I'm saying? Call me. You know, I've always wanted to learn to play the guitar. - Me too. - I guess we still could. Probably takes years, though, right? Who's got that kind of time? You know, um... ...my work threw me a curve ball today and canceled all my meetings. Do you wanna get some breakfast? - I think I have time for that. - Great. You strike me as a traditionalist when it comes to breakfast. Oh, I don't know about that. No. I go a little crazy. Wow, a 20. - Someone must really like your music. - Actually, he liked the girl next to him. - He was trying to impress her. - Her? Yeah, you just missed them. Thanks. So it must be a great job you have. You can just show up when you want... ...not show up when you want. Well, I'm sort of a troubleshooter. I try to keep things from veering off course. - You? - I was a receptionist at St. Luke's. - Yesterday was my last day. - You quit. - Mm-hm. - So, what's next? It remains to be seen. But for today... ...I got a list. - A list? - Mm-hm. - Why do I get the feeling... ...there's more to this story? You mind if I took a look at that list? No. It's private! It's just some stuff around town. You can live in Paris your whole life and never go to the Eiffel Tower. Mm-hm. What's number one to do on the aforementioned list? Are you inviting yourself along? Only if I'm welcome, and only if it doesn't involve opera or clowns. You are. And it doesn't. I just hope you like dead ducks. It was the last thing he ever painted. I majored in art history. And my first big crush was on Robert Vander Krawl. I stayed up all night writing an essay on this very painting... ...crying the entire time. All he wanted was a normal life. A wife, family. He'd completed over 200 canvases... ...by the time he was 29 and never sold a single one. He killed himself one night with poison. He was completely alone... ...convinced that nobody cared about him or his work... ...that he was worth more dead than alive. - Are you crying? - Uh-uh. - You okay? - Mm-hm. Hey, Jack! Still haven't learned your manners? I'm Tru Davies. Megan Roberts. Nice to meet you. So, what's new, Jack? - Would you give me a minute? - Mm-hm. Sure. I know how you're getting your inside information. You see the victim's day when you rewind. Very clever girl, Tru. It only took you six months to figure that one out. Let me guess, you saw the painting? Just my luck. This was the first museum I tried. She asked you for help, didn't she? Wow. So obviously there's been some kind of sick cosmic mix-up. Maybe not. Maybe it happened this way for a reason. What are you saying, you're gonna help her? "Help me" doesn't always mean "save me." The hell it doesn't. Why else would she ask you? To be honest, I'm not sure yet. But this much I do know: She didn't ask you for help. You've got no business here. - Unless, of course, you intend to kill her. - Oh, I wouldn't wanna step on your toes. Actually, she's gonna handle the hard part. What are you talking about? She's gonna kill herself. And if she doesn't wanna live, she's got no use for you. Your guess was right, Davis. Megan Roberts is definitely the victim. She jumped off the Edison Tower. Okay, let's see. Megan Roberts, 28, attended Reed College. She, uh, graduated in 1997. Currently lives here in town at 1025 Birch Lane. There's also a Wendy Roberts, could be a sister or mother. I don't get it. Why does someone who wants to die ask for help? Consider who she asked. Death himself. Yeah, but she was already dead. What would she need from Jack? More importantly, what does she need from you? - Figured I'd find you here. - Hey, man. Unbelievable. - Hey, Billy. Hey, man, what is up, bro? - Oh, you know, same old. We call you every Friday night, Ed Bone's poker game, you never show. I know, man. I've been crazy busy. - Yeah? What's her name? - No. I got a job. Yeah, I got a job. I'm working for my old man. That's great. I thought you were too cool to hang out with us. No. Hey, man, can I get two? So how is everybody, man? How's Larry doing? Oh, Fat Larry, man, he's in jail. - Oh, shut up. - No, it's assault. He's looking at, like, eight years. - Wow. - So, what, you came just to hang out... ...and get faced or what? Well, you see it's a little hard to explain, actually, um... Oh, I know why you're here. I know that look. What look? What? What look? The "I'm broke and I need some cash," that's what look. No. No, no. It's not that, man. It's... Chill. Don't worry. Let your big brother Billy front you, all right? Check it. There's a job tonight. It's boxes in the trucks. Easy-peasy. Hmm? Huh? Mmm. Yeah... No. I got a better idea. We get some beers, grab some pizza... ...and go back to my place and watch that Coogan fight. We'll just kick it old-school style, me and you. Not to worry, my brother. You in. Come on. Sit. Hey. Wendy, right? - Right. - I'm Tru Davies. Megan and I used to be floor mates back at Reed. - She does live here, right? - Yeah, she does. Um... So, um, when was the last time you and Megan talked? It's been mostly Christmas cards the past couple of years. Actually, I was starting to get worried because... ...she hasn't returned my last couple phone calls. And the one time we did speak, she sounded kind of distant. Is everything all right? Look, um... Why don't you come inside. We should talk. - Working late? - As usual. Yeah. Me too. So I was thinking, what do you say that we have dinner here together? - In the morgue? - Sure. It'll be fun. Like a picnic, only with cold tile instead of warm sand. - Hey, you go in. I'II, uh, meet you inside. - Okay. - I have to talk to Megan. - Stay out of this. She's dying. I spoke to her sister. She has leukemia. You see, you don't have to do anything tonight. She's gonna die anyway. - Did you hear me? - Yeah, I heard you. Thank you. Jack! Whoa, whoa, where's your ticket? I don't have one. How much are they? We've been sold out for two weeks. Good luck finding any. Two tickets! I got two tickets for the jazz. Anybody want two tickets? - I'll take them. - Hey. Weird. I tried calling you earlier. - How much you want for them? - What, for these? - Nothing, you really want them? - For us, we'll go, it'll be fun. No, I hate jazz, I don't wanna go. Me too. But you know, it's like lima beans. You have to check in every once in a while to see if your taste has changed. Come on. - Hey. - Hey, you okay? Yeah. Yeah, sure. - Oh, don't tell me. You hate jazz. - No, it's not that. It's just, um... Is there maybe something going on that you're not telling me? Because I like you, Megan, and I think we've been having a really great day. - Then let's keep having it. - I'd like that. But I get the feeling there's not gonna be another one. Let's say I told you I wanted to see you again this weekend. What would you say to that? - I'm not gonna be around this weekend. - Where are you gonna be? Six months ago... ...I found out I have leukemia. The doctors give me a year. The first symptoms came on pretty quick. My sister had to quit her job last month to take care of me when things got bad. From here on out, it only gets worse. The good days... ...like today... ...will slowly dwindle away to nothing. The pain will get worse. Most people with this kind of leukemia... ...spend the last few months of their lives in a hospital bed... ...hooked up to machines and tubes, completely helpless. I will not die like that. This list. It's 10 things I wanted to do before I died. Only got around to four of them. Procrastinator till the end, I guess. Do the others for me, Jack. One day I will see you again, and you can tell me all about it. This is your list. You should do these things. When I was in bed these last few weeks, I made a promise to myself. If I could get just one more good day, I would take advantage of it. I have an insurance policy through work, good only in case of accidental death. A hundred thousand dollars. Mine's going to my sister. - And you're gonna kill yourself? - Not exactly. I told you, the policy doesn't pay on suicide. It has to look like an accident. Oh, I should've seen this coming. This Tru, is she an ex-girlfriend or something? It's a long story. Hey, you guys. What a weird coincidence. - Jack, Megan, this is Jensen Richie. - Hey. I saw you at Tru's party. - How you doing? - Good. First the museum, and now this. We should all hang out together. Or not. You wanna get a drink, Megan? - Yeah, it'd be great. - I'll get us something too. Why don't you and Megan hang out. We'll be right back. - Okay. - Okay, what is it with those two? I don't know. But I'm sure it's one hell of a story. She has an insurance policy, $ 100,000. When she died on day one, everyone thought it was suicide. Tonight it has to look like an accident. That's the only way the policy pays off. That's why she asked me for help. - And you're gonna do it? - She wants this, Tru. She doesn't wanna suffer through a long, slow, painful decline. It's her life. It's her death. It's her decision. I'm gonna talk to her, Jack, whether you wanna try and stop me or not. Be my guest. - Hey. Oh! - Oh, God! Tru, you have a really hard head. Thank you. I mean, I'm sorry. Are you okay? No, it's fine, I think. I thought you were gonna get drinks. I totally forgot. Um, would you mind getting them for us? Look, I know this is weird, but kind of fun, in a weird way, right? - Not really, but... - Five minutes. I need five minutes to talk to Megan, and then we'll go get dinner. My treat. Okay. I'm just gonna go rinse the blood off my teeth. - Fantastic idea. - All right. We gotta get going. I gotta tell Kevin you're onboard tonight. Oh, hey, look, about tonight. Skip it. - What're you talking about? - Skip it. We're gonna make, like, $300 in, like, half an hour. Yeah. Or get nailed. You just spent the day... ...telling me half the guys we grew up with are locked up. They're in jail. Billy, you have used up about 10 of your nine lives. You can't be lucky forever. One day things are gonna go sour. I just don't want it to be tonight. - Right? - So wait up. Is that why you came by today? To tell me to stop doing jobs? I don't see you for three months and suddenly you're my parole officer? I'm just saying, you don't have to do it tonight. What? You want me to call my daddy, like you? Maybe he can give me a job? Here's the problem. My daddy lives on a bench right across from the bus depot, right? Last time I saw him, he asked me for a quarter. Didn't even know who I was. We gotta do this less often. - Hey, I'm trying to do you a favor, man. - Step off. I'm sorry about your father. But take it from a friend. Life, it doesn't hand you too many second chances. Now, you just got one. Now, trust me on this, Billy. Okay? Stay home. I'll take it under advisement. So... ...what's up with you and Jack, huh? Love or hate? I wish it were that easy. But the two of you seem to be hitting it off, though. - Have you known him long? - Just met him today. Oh. It's funny how things can change in a day, huh? Oh, just so you know, Jack and I are not together. We never have been. So he's fair game if you're interested. I'm not really thinking long-term. Yeah, sometimes it's more fun not to. Last year I had someone I was real close to... ...and it took off fast and heavy, and then, uh... Well, and then he died. Oh, I'm so sorry. I was so angry when Luc died. I couldn't breathe. After a while, I realized how lucky I was... ...for the time I had with him. And then the craziest thing happened. What? I had a great day. Right when I thought that I never would again. Sometimes good stuff happens out of the blue too. So apparently Jack told you I'm dying, I have a life insurance policy... ...and I don't plan on being around for Christmas. Look, I'm not trying to question your motives. I can't even begin to imagine what you're dealing with. But what if there was another way to get that money? A hundred thousand dollars? Unless you're a bank robber, I'd say you're crazy. What if I could? It's not just about the money. I know. But you had a great day. I mean, you could set your Plan B in effect any time. Tomorrow or next week or next month. It doesn't have to end tonight. How you doing? Better and better. Anyways, guys, it was so great to see you, but I've gotta go. - Right now? - Yeah. Just think about what I said. Here. - Where you going? - To the Coogan fight. Oh, you're ditching jazz to go watch boxing? Oh, I am in! Deal. Coogan takes a hit. Then another. Norm 's hands just keep coming. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the way it was supposed to go. And he goes down. Coogan is down. It's all over. I tell you, folks... Damn it. ... somebody should've seen this coming. And it's official. Coogan is out. That's 50, 100. - Hi. - Thank you. Okay, and that's $ 100,000? I had a hunch. - Uh, it'll have to be a cashier's check. - That's perfect. Could you make it out to Wendy and Megan Roberts, please? Okay. Hey, you wanna see something awesome? I just won $ 100. Wow, that's great! Okay, miss, I just need you to sign right here and here. I didn't know you made a bet. - Yeah, I did. - How much did you win? - Um, a hundred bucks, like you. - Nice. - You know, you can get that in cash. - Yeah, I know, but it's for tax purposes. There you go. Thanks. Think I should've gotten mine in a check? - Oh, no, cash is so much more fun. - Hmm. Hmm. These are fantastic. Harrison, you just won us this case. I'm proud of you. Umm... - So, what's gonna happen to those guys? - Jail, most likely. Great job, son. Right. So how we doing on that list of yours? We still got some time. I know. But right now, all I wanna do is see my sister. I hope she's still awake. Wendy? You're not gonna believe what happened. Your friend Tru stopped by. She just handed this to me. Some story about a special charity, the Relive Your Day Foundation. I mean, is this for real? Apparently. Do you have any idea what this means? The best doctors, the best treatment. - And that trip to Greece you wanted. - Number 10 on my list! Well, we're going! - I love you so much. - Me too. Today was... How do I put this? I know, it was bizarre. I know. I'm sorry. Sometimes my life can be a little weird. Yeah, I noticed. - But having you there made it better. - Better? - Like, almost fun. - Almost fun? Wow. That is a ringing endorsement. "Almost fun." Nice. - You know what I mean. - Yeah. Sometimes I can just go to dinner and see a movie and be very, very normal. I think maybe normal's overrated. So... ...one weird day, huh? You have no idea. - We had a long talk, you know. - You and your sister? Me and Tru. She made me think about a lot of stuff. I think maybe I've been pretty selfish. - Stupid. - How so? Well... ...I tried to make it all about the money... ...but now that we have it, time seems more important. I thought you didn't want machines and tubes. I don't. But like Tru said, I can always go to Plan B later. If I've got just a few more good days... ...with you... ...then I don't wanna miss any of them. I was gonna sort of take this one-way trip tonight... ...but now, if you're willing... ...maybe we could both go. When I was a little girl, my dad worked at the Edison Tower. He would take me up to the observation deck, point out at the horizon and say... ...that everything I could possibly dream of was just past that line. He'd say, "Just picture it, whatever your heart desires... ...and it's out there just waiting for you." He died when I was 10... ...but I've always gone back there... ...to look out over the city... ...and dream about the things that I want. If I look long enough, I can usually see them. Go with me tonight, Jack. And what do you think we'll see? Another day. I'm gonna go get my coat. - <i>Hello.</i> - She was gonna kill herself. All she wanted from me was to help her make it look like an accident. Congratulations. Easy day. - She changed her mind. - That's not an option. - I'm not gonna kill her. - That's not an option either. - You know the rules. - <i>Yeah.</i> A body asks Tru for help, and I make sure they stay dead. But I'm not the one who changed the rules this time. So as far as I'm concerned, it's dealer's choice. Jack. When fate gets messed with, there are consequences. You ready to accept the responsibility for those consequences? You have to be strong, Jack, and you have to do your job. Come on. Let's make this a night to remember. Who secretly led the Rohirrim through the mountain pass to Minas Tirith's aid? Okay, I know this. - Oh, no, it doesn't look like it. - Uh... - Celebrimbor? No, that's not right. - Oh, I got you. It's Ghân-buri-Ghân. - You gotta take your punishment. - All right. Saved by the bell. Hello? - Davis? - No, it's Zoron. Of course it's Davis. I need your help. Have you been drinking? Uh... Just a little bit. I'm on a date with Carrie, but I'm clear-headed, I swear. At your service, go ahead. I've covered all the bases with Megan and Jack. But I wanna be at Edison Tower to make sure nothing goes wrong. Do you know how late the observation deck stays open? The Edison Tower observation deck stays open from 9 a.m. To midnight. Okay, I'm gonna be a bit late to work. I'm gonna stay till they close. You go, girl. Thanks, D. Take it easy on the Bartles and Jaymes, okay? Okay. Bye-bye. I have to go to the little girls' room. Okay. Yeah. Tru's headed to Edison Tower. She wants to get there before you. Got it. Thanks. - Bad news? - Work. Scheduling thing. - They always call this late? - We never sleep. - Well, I am glad you took the day off. - Yeah. Me too. Otherwise today would've turned out very differently. I'll tell you a secret. I, uh... - I hate my job. - Aw. - Then why not quit? - I'm not sure I'm strong enough. Oh. So you take some time off and figure it out. - It's not the end of the world. - I hope not. Well, you know, you've never told me exactly what it is that you do. I help people. Although most of the time they don't realize I am helping them, but I am. I try to make sure their lives go according to plan. - Like a counselor? - Yeah. Sort of like that. Helping people. It doesn't sound so bad to me. You know what we should do? We should close our eyes... ...spin around, point a finger and whatever direction it is, we go. Car, boat, train, I don't care. First thing in the morning. That would be great. It's funny. I feel like I've been given a second chance. - You know that feeling? - Yeah, I do. Hey, Megan, um... Your list. You should keep it now. - Megan, I'm sorry. - I got it. - No, wait a sec. - Hey. It's my list. Megan, wait. Megan! Ah! Jack! - Jack! - I got you. I got you. Help me! Jack. Look up there! Jack, help me! Jack! Jack, help me. Pull me up. Please, Jack! Please. - I can't. - Ah! I can't. I'm not strong enough. Jack! Jack! Please! - Help me! - I'm sorry. So sorry. Jack. Just hold on, man! - Jack! - Somebody call 911! - She fell! - She got too close. - It was some sort of crazy accident.
