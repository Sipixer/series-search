I have a nice guy that I work with. - Who, me? - Yes. You, Davis. I have good friends. A cute boy, who I can almost call my boyfriend. And, every week or so, I get a shout- out from a corpse and.... You relive the day. It comes in handy, you know? Bad day? Do it over. Bad outfit, quick wardrobe change. - Premature death? - Prevent it from happening. Well, Wonder Woman has nothing on you. Except for the pointy bras and the invisible plane, no. It's nice to see you making peace with it. Let's be honest. It's not like I really have a choice. I don't think those people will take no for an answer. Just out of curiosity, who else have you told about what you can do? Just my brother. Not that he believes me. Except when he thinks he can make a buck on the ponies. - Anyone else? - No. Not my sister, or Lindsay. And definitely not Luc. It's hard enough to date without dropping that bomb. What about your father? It's kind of hard to tell someone who doesn't want to talk to you. And it's funny. I can prevent death... but I can't make a father take interest in his own daughter. - Tru-- - I know. Too much information. No. I just want you to remember that a gift like yours is never simple. But there's someone... who's gonna be very grateful for what you can do. Maybe even today. Jake. We just got your CAT scan back. And? Why don't we talk for a moment? Jake. What are you doing out of bed? And why are you wearing your uniform? You know you're supposed to be in your robe. Jake? Jake. No go. You know the rules. I need to get out of here. Jake, I'm sorry. You know the doc said to take it easy. I'll be back in a couple of hours. I just gotta do something. One thing. Come on, back inside. You're not supposed to be out here anyway. Jake, you okay? You all right? I'm just.... - What are you doing? Don't be stupid. - I told you, I gotta get out of here. Jake, come on, listen to me. I just talked to the doc and.... I'll be back in a couple of hours. You won't even miss me. What the hell was that? He had a gun. I saw he had a gun. It was Jake, for God's sake. It's just Jake. He's dead. Hey, it's Tru. Leave a message. HeIIo, Tru, it's your father. I know it's been a whiIe... but I'd Iike to taIk to you when you get a chance. You know where to reach me. Goodbye. Dad called you, too? - Yeah, why? You? - Yeah. And Harrison, also. He's sweet like that. Every five years, no matter how busy he is... he drops everything and he calls. What'd he say? It was a short, unpleasant conversation. He asked if I had a job yet. He asked if I had a husband yet. Just like the old guy. Charming as ever. So what did he ask you? - Nothing. - Nothing? I didn't call him back yet. I will, just a little later, though. You believe that SOB? Doesn't talk to us in ages. And when he does, all he wants to do is criticize. I wonder what he would've said to me. "You work in a morgue?" And"You're not a doctor yet?" - Sounds about right. - Look at the bright side. - At least you've got a job. - Yeah. And a guy. - Hello? - Hey, it's me. How's Grandma? How's Rochester? One is feeling better, the other is way too far away from you. Good news. Davis is letting me take an early shift so we can finally have our night alone. - That's great. - But? But there's a small problem. Train derailment. They shut down aII routes up and down the entire seaboard. - Wonderful. - But don't worry. I'II figure it out. It's gonna take more than a train derailment to keep us apart. Well, what the hell. You don't have a résumé? Let's be honest. What is a"résumé" anyway? A list of jobs that didn't work out. No, seriously, I believe in starting fresh. I'm always looking forward. Never back. And tell me, what are some of the unique qualities... that you could bring to this job? Laughs. A lot of laughs, Marjorie. You mind if I call you Marjorie? Not quite as creepy as I thought it'd be. Meredith, what a surprise. I figured we're actually getting along today... why not push our luck. I also thought you'd like to know our brother went on a job interview today. Dad really got to him, huh? Yeah, well, not enough to keep him from totally tanking the interview. Why, what happened? Same old thing. Wore the wrong thing, said the wrong thing... didn't even bring a résumé. Face it, Harry's not exactly the nine- to- five type. That's what you came here to tell me? No, actually. I came to find out what Dad said to you. Don't know. I haven't called back. - But you will, right? - Why should I? So he can pass judgment on me, too? I mean, Iook how he made you feeI, and Harrison. Look, Dad's off in Connecticut with a new wife, a new life... and every five years he calls his kids and we're supposed to jump? He's still our father, Tru. Yeah. Our father, who art in Greenwich. Who's that? Davis, my boss. Cute. In that he's- so- not- my- type kind of way. Wait a second, I know what Dad said to you... but tell me you're not thinking what I think-- - He's a doctor, am I right? - Yeah, but-- Thought I'd let you know I'll take my lunch break now. I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. - Hi, I'm Tru's sister, Meredith. - Hi. Tru didn't tell me she had a younger sister. Actually, I'm her older sister. I'm shocked. Your epidermal layer is flawless. You know, I haven't eaten all day. I mean, if you wouldn't mind some company.... Really? So the gentleman's aorta... was literally wrapped around his left ventricle... and I'd never seen anything like it. And not to mention that his inferior vena cava... which, an interesting thing about that-- Is there anything else that we could talk about besides autopsies? - Sure. - Great. So, you a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fan? No, sorry. Would you like me to finish the autopsy story... 'cause it contains a lot of interesting things. No, thank you. Look at that. lsn't that the bailiff from Judge Stern's court? I'll be right back. Jim. What a surprise. So nice to see you. I didn't recognize you without your uniform. She walked out on you? Not literally. Okay, literally. She spotted some bailiff she knew. The next thing I know, she's riding off on his motorcycle. Davis, I'm so sorry. She's a little unpredictable sometimes. Not to mention, my father has us all acting a little crazy today. It's not the first time it's happened. Just the quickest. I should've known a girl like that wouldn't be interested in a guy like me. Morgue. You're where? About 80 miles west of where I'm supposed to be. - What happened? - The rental agency gave me directions. - Bad ones? - Not if I wanted to go to Cleveland. I know we were both looking forward to tonight... but it doesn't look like I'm getting home before dawn. - That'll teach us to make a plan. - We'll have our night soon. Promise. lncoming. Okay, I gotta go. Drive safe, okay? Bye. Cpl. Jake Voight, 21, just got home from a tour of the Middle East. - What happened? - A disturbance at the Army Hospital. One of the MPs had an itchy trigger finger. - Time of death? - 10:00 a. m. on the dot. Slight jurisdiction problem, otherwise we would've had him sooner. It looks like a clean shot. Probably died instantly. He survived the war. Couldn't survive coming home, huh? Shipped out from Fort McAllister 18 months ago. He was wounded in battle. Took a bullet in the thigh. CIean biII of heaIth and they sent him home. The doc said he was a hero, saved his entire squad in Afghanistan. You know anything else about him? You writing his biography? Maybe rewriting it. The Army notify his family? No one to notify. The Army said there is no next of kin. It's a shame. No one should have to die alone. Do me a favor. Take him to Number 2... I'll do an autopsy tonight. I need you. Hey, it's Tru. Leave a message. HeIIo, Tru, it's your father. I know it's been a whiIe... but I'd Iike to taIk to you when you get a chance. I can't make it to breakfast today. How about one of these days, let me know the night before... - so I don't have to wake up so early? - Sorry. I never know when these things are gonna come up. By the way, I got an interesting call this morning. Me, too. You know what he said to me? Wondered when I was gonna get a job. Look, here's the thing, Harry. None of us will ever be good enough for him. - Nothing we do will ever-- - You don't think I know that? I stopped trying to impress the guy when I turned 14. - Harry? - Yeah? I just wanted to say employers like résumés. They like applicants who dress nice and who know their business. - Tru, what's this about? - Nothing. Nothing at all. Just one more thing. Make sure Meredith doesn't stop by the morgue today, okay? - Okay. Whatever. - Hi. - Who was that? - Tru. She can't make breakfast. No surprise there. And she said not to stop by the morgue later. Stop by the morgue? Why would she think I'd ever stop by the morgue? I don't know. Why would she ever think I'd need a résumé? No, I'm serious. Train derailment? You haven't heard? Because it's all over the news down here. It's a good thing you told me. I'd hate to get stuck in Rochester all day. Why don't you take the bus? I know for a fact there's one that leaves in half an hour. That's impressive. Weird, but impressive. But I'm not much for buses. I think I'll just spring for the rental car instead. - No. - Don't you want to see me tonight? No, of course I do. It's just I want to make sure you have the proper directions. Why do I have a feeling you're gonna tell me what they are? Hi, Jake Voight? - Down the hall, Room 248. - Thanks. I need you. Hi, I'm here to see a patient. I'm sorry, visiting hours don't start until noon. Noon? - Time of death? - 10:00 a. m. on the dot. I can't wait until noon. In fact, I can't wait much longer at all. I can't wait until noon. In fact, I can't wait much longer at all. Jake's an old friend of mine from basic. I heard he was here. I'm sorry, miss. He'll still be here in two hours. - Please, you don't understand. - I understand fine. We'll see you at noon. Jake. We just got your CAT scan back. And? Why don't we talk for a moment? Jake. What are you doing out of bed? And why are you wearing your uniform? You know you're supposed to be in your robe. Jake? Excuse me, Nurse? - Yes? - The patient wants a second opinion. I've got a healthy male with a swollen leg. lbuprofen and bed rest? No go. You know the rules. I've done that for four days. I think I should see the doctor. - Smoker? - Once in a while. He could have DVT. You might wanna do an ultrasound. That's just me. I need to get out of here. I'm sorry, Jake. Maybe you should stick around a little longer. What are you doing? Don't be stupid. No. I told you, I gotta get out. I just talked to the doc and-- Jake, put down the gun, please. Listen to her, Jake. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Okay? You won't even miss me. No, don't. Jake, let her go. I told you, I just gotta get out of here. Don't move. Just take it easy. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Listen, tell them I'll be back as soon as I can. Wait, where are you going, Jake? You okay, Nurse? Yeah, I'm fine. Stop! So is Jake. - I'm not sure I'd say that. - Why? Because if we don't find him soon, next time you see him, he'll be dead. Jake was wounded overseas. The doctors removed the bullet and sent him back to the States to recuperate. Two weeks ago, we learned that a bullet fragment... had become dislodged and settled in his pulmonary artery. So you removed the fragment? We tried, but he began hemorrhaging during surgery. When do you try again? Well, until this morning we had no plans. What happened this morning? A CAT scan revealed that an embolism had formed. We have no other choice but to open him up again. 'Cause if the embolism ruptures the artery.... He'll die immediately. That kid has a time bomb ticking inside of him. So let's just hope that the MPs find him before it goes off. I don't get it. I save a guy only to learn he could be dead by the end of the day. Once the symptoms set in, shortness of breath, sweating... it's only a matter of hours. Even if I find him before the embolism kills him... there's no guarantee he'll survive. Okay, let's just think. You told me that Jake said he had something to do. Yeah. That's what I heard him tell the MP. If you knew that you were gonna die in a matter of hours, what would you do? I don't know. Cry. Get drunk. Say goodbye. According to his enlistment papers, Jake has no family, no next of kin. There was a photo in his wallet. A picture of a girl. Her name is Bridget Elkins. She couldn't be older than 19. There's no Bridget. There is a George Elkins at 567 Charleston Road. - It could be her father. - I'll take it. Thanks. By the way, you just missed your sister. - She came here? - Yeah. You guys didn't happen to make plans by any chance? I can take it. How bad did it go? She dumped you for a bailiff on a motorcycle. Davis, look, she's my sister and I love her, but she's complicated. I should've known a girl like Meredith would never go for a guy like me. - You really liked her, huh? - Yeah. I may regret this, but take notes... 'cause I'll tell you everything you need to know about my sister. London, yes. But to be honest, the city that I really love is Dublin. I lived there my junior year. That's amazing. That's so cool. The next thing you know... you'll tell me you're thinking about moving back there. Now this is getting weird. Someone you know? No one important. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my love for animals. I love all kinds. Dogs, cats. I adore horses. I see. So Tru did a pretty good job, huh? Telling you exactly what to say? Let me tell you something Tru doesn't know about me. I don't want a guy to be just like me. I want a guy to be himself. That's what really impresses me. - Be myself? - Yeah. - Okay, I can do that. - Good. So.... You a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fan? 567 Charleston. Jake. You okay? She's gone. They left. You're that nurse from the hospital. It's okay, I'm alone. You have to go back. Without that surgery, you'll die. And with it, I hear my chances aren't that much better. Anyway, I'm not going back until I find her. Bridget? I was 18. I was stationed at McAllister. She was finishing her senior year in high school. You were in love with her. Yeah. Crazy love. I saw her... and I just knew. Luckily, she felt the same way. That's what I thought. What happened? I don't know. That's just it. I had a 48- hour pass before I was shipped out. The greatest two days of my life. Just me and Bridget. Then I deploy, and a telegram shows up. She said she never wanted to see me again... that we were over. Done. I called, but her number was changed. I wrote, but the letters came back to me. And if you don't mind me asking, what makes you want to see her now? As much as I'd like to... there are a lot of things I can't forget. About war... about seeing your best buddies shot down in the desert... 8, 000 miles from home. But the one thing I can't remember... is the one thing I swore I'd never forget. Her face. All I have left is this. I could die... on the table, or right now. - And if I do.... - You don't know that. And if I do... I don't want to close my eyes... and not be able to see her face. Of course, now she's gone. Can't find her anywhere. There are a lot of ways to find someone, Jake. Really? If I help you, you promise me you'll go back and get that surgery? Sure. Still, I don't know how I'm gonna find her. The house is empty. They moved. Look inside, all that's left are light bulbs and old magazines. Old magazines? Hi, this is Bridget Elkins. How am I? To tell you the truth, not too good. I've called three times this month... and I still can't get you people to send your magazine to my new address. Yeah. Just so it doesn't happen again, could you do me a favor... and confirm that you have the correct forwarding address? Yes? 4963 Denson. That's it. Thanks very much. You have no idea how many applicants show up without a résumé. - No. - Yes. I mean, just having one puts you at the top of my list. Of course, I don't notice any prior experience in real estate. That's because I don't have any. But look, I've been selling something to someone since I was 16... and what I found is that as long as you listen to the customer... you can be successful no matter what your product is. All right then, what are some of the unique qualities... that you could bring to this job? Laughs. A lot of laughs, Marjorie. But, seriously. Passion, sincerity... and a little thing I like to call"persistence." Unique? Maybe not. But what this company needs? Absolutely. Here we are. Looks like Mr. Elkins has been doing okay for himself. - How do I look? - Great. Well. - Not bad for a dead man anyway. - Come on, stop that. Hey. You're sweating. Once the symptoms set in, shortness of breath, sweating... it's only a matter of hours. You stay here, I'll get her. You promise, as soon as you see her, it's right back to the hospital. Yeah. Just one thing. If her father answers the door, don't mention my name. - Why not? - Bridget's a smart girl. He's got big plans for her. Falling in love with a soldier was not one. Probably can't blame him. I mean, does your dad like the guys you bring home? He never met them. I'm sorry. He's dead? Just by choice. - Hello. - Hi. Is Bridget home? - No, she's out right now. - Could you tell me where I might find her? - I'm sorry, you are? - A friend of hers from high school. You must not recognize me. Tru Davies. No, I can't say that I.... New nose. And I lost, like, 20 pounds, too. Don't be embarrassed. You wouldn't be the first. Tru. Yes, of course. Why don't you come in for a moment? Now, what's so urgent? I'm only in town for a few hours. In fact, I'm on my way to the airport and if I didn't see her-- She's at school. She's got class all afternoon. I'll tell her you stopped by, if you'd like. Or I could swing by campus, if you point me in the right direction. Look, she'll back from the JC in a few hours. Junior College, but Bridget was a valedictorian. She could've written her own ticket. Come on, Jake. We're going back to the hospital right now. Jake? Who are you? Did you bring Jake here? Is that why you came? Yes, but you don't understand. He needs to see Bridget. You leave my house. And you stay away from my daughter. I said let go. You have to go with them. I came to see Bridget. - I didn't see her. - I know where she is. I promise you, Jake, I'll find her. Just please go. Oh, my God. Hurry. - Get him back now. - Come on, let's go. They're not too happy about that jeep, by the way. I'll find her. You know, I don't even know your name. Tru. Tru. You're not really a nurse, are you? What makes you say that? You're some sort of angel. Can I help you? I'm looking for Bridget Elkins. The registrar said she was here. She was, yes. But you just missed her. The class ended five minutes ago. Do you know where she is now? Is Bridget in some sort of trouble? It's her grandmother. Nothing serious. She slipped in the tub again, and Mr. Elkins asked me to find her. Let me see, if it helps you, she normally meets Phillip after class. - Phillip? - Yeah. They're quite the popular couple on campus. Try the Metzler Building, 212. He should be finishing up there. Thanks. Thanks, Regina. Say bye, Phillip. Bye. - Bridget? - Yes? - He's beautiful, your boy. - Thank you. He looks just like his father. What? Listen, I'm a friend of Jake's. He needs to see you, both of you. What? I haven't heard from Jake in a year- and- a- half-- He may not survive the day. This is all a little bit much, okay? I haven't heard from Jake in 18 months. - Suddenly you show up-- - He doesn't know about Phillip. Why does that sound like some sort of accusation? It's not. I found out I was pregnant the day he was shipped out. And I tried to contact him, but I couldn't. Obviously, he had no interest in reaching me. You sent him a telegram. You told him not to contact you. What? Telegram? I don't know what he's told you, but.... I'm over him. I don't know why I'm getting so upset. He wants to see you before he goes into surgery. We could be at the hospital in under an hour. Ten years ago, I lost someone that I love. And not a day goes by that I don't wish I could see her one more time. You still have that chance, Bridget. Sorry. I can't. I lost him once, I can't lose him again. Guardian angel or stalker? You decide. I was in the neighborhood. How are you feeling? As soon as I'm stable, they're taking me to surgery. After that, anyone's guess. - I'm so sorry, Jake. - For what? I was supposed to help you. You wanted to see her, and I couldn't do what you asked. Don't do that. - You tried. - I failed. What? You didn't fail. Why are you being so hard on yourself? I saw where she lives. I know she's in school. She sounds happy. Healthy. She was more alive for me today than she has been in two years. That's nothing to apologize for. I thought he was never gonna go down. You hungry? There's-- No, thanks. A crazy thing happened today. This woman came by... - said Jake wanted to see me. - Really? She seems convinced that I sent him some stupid breakup telegram. Listen, there's a lot of odd people in the world. Nothing to take to heart. Please, tell me it wasn't you, Daddy. Sweetheart-- Tell me that you didn't sign my name. - That you didn't send it. - Look at me. Not until you say that you didn't send it. Because he's sick. He could die. You had your whole future ahead of you. Princeton, Stanford, you could have gone anywhere. My God. - I knew it. - You got knocked up by a soldier. You were the top of your class. He was enlisted-- - I loved him! - Where did that get you? Running between daycare and some third- rate community college. You could've been great. You are my father, you're supposed to love me no matter what I am. You ever wonder how one little decision can change your whole life? All the time. If I didn't join the Army.... You never would've been stationed here. You never would've met Bridget. Maybe I would have met her somewhere else. I would've had a nine to five, a house and kids. Man, we would have had some cute kids. Jake, listen.... I'm sure you would have. Excuse me. Hello? Hey, hey. Why don't you come meet me so we can celebrate? I can't make it tonight. But congratulations, Harry. Not sure how you knew, but thanks to you... she offered it to me on the spot. That's great. I'm so happy for you. And, thanks to me, I turned it down. You know, screw the guy if he can't love me for who I am. I'II see you, okay? - Bridget. - Hi, Jake. You came. God, look at you. You look beautiful. Jake, there's someone I want you to meet. You have a son. We do. Phillip, say hi to your daddy. Hey. How did we screw things up so bad? - Don't talk. - Were we too proud? Too stupid? Here we go, Corporal. All that matters is I'm here now. So whatever happens to me, I want you to have a good life. I want you to marry. I want Phillip to have a father. He has a father. Have a good life, Bridge. Promise me. Jake, you're gonna be fine. Promise me, Bridge. Take care of him. It's taking so long. - It was a risk. We all knew that. - What? Oh, my God. I am so sorry. I lost him. You didn't lose him, Tru. His time was just up. Jake knew he wouldn't survive the surgery. That's why he asked you for your help. But it's my job to prevent death. To save people. All that. Well, maybe Jake wasn't the one who needed saving. Maybe you saved the person you were supposed to. Bridget. You let her say goodbye, because yesterday, she wasn't able to. - This job's just confusing sometimes. - I know. That's why you have me.  Key under the mat, right? You made it. Yeah. Did you ever think I wouldn't? No. Never. - You okay? - Better now. Why don't you relax? There's just one thing I gotta do. Leave a message at the beep. Hey, Dad. It's Tru. I know we haven't talked in a while... but I want you to know I'm doing okay. I have a new job. I guess you could say I help people. Sometimes, if I'm lucky, they even help me. That's why I'm calling. Because I know how hard it is for two people to find each other. Especially when one of them doesn't want to be found. So, good night, Dad... I hope you're happy and well, because I am. And from now on, you don't have to try to find me... because suddenly... I don't feel lost.
