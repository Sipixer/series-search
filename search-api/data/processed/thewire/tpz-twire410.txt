Get out of the way! - Driving all crazy. - Damn. 16. I've got a foot chase on a number-one male. Maybe 13 years, short, with braids, in the alleys eastbound from Fulton. This kid has bailed out! Bailed out! Motherfucking fuck fuck fuck fuck! Officer, what are you doing? What, you need bifocals or something? What? 0-9. I'm responding. 16, 200 north. I'm gonna need your name. Listen. I'm very sorry, ma'am, all right? Give me the hat. Nah, see, them Expeditions are hard to handle. But with a Lexus, man I wouldn't have no problem. You little motherfucker. - You know how many cars you hit? - What? Don't even think of bullshitting. I don't know what you're talking about. You know what kind of fucking paperwork I got now, huh? You know how many hours of my life you owe me, you little shit? Damn, yo! That hurt! You think that hurts... No, no. Aah! You're so smart, - see how easy you boost a car now. - Aah! You imagine Rawls sitting in this chair? Never happen. In this town: Uh-uh. Yeah, well, we weren't supposed to have a white mayor, either. He already overreached putting Rawls in charge. De-fucking-facto. Motherfucker ain't even sworn in yet. Already, he's got feelers out. I know for a fact he called the deputy chief in Pittsburgh-- Friend of mine-- promised him pie in the sky. Shi-it, partner. All you got to do is show Carcetti and everybody else that they already got the man for the job. They ain't got to look no further. The indispensable man. It was Royce holding you back, Ervin. Now out from under, you shine. Clay, he's saying everything goes through Bill Rawls. Any move I try to make-- You're still the commissioner, ain't you? You give an order, they gonna jump. - Yeah, but Carcetti-- - What he gonna do, fire you? He just showed you he don't have balls enough. You just need to give Carcetti a little something. Make him start seeing you in a new light. Like what: Some kind of police shit. Hell, I don't know. Something that looks good to Carcetti, so he can say it was his idea to keep you all along. Hmm. Police shit: Well, whatever it is y'all do for a living. Well-- just take care of your end and let your friends handle theirs. Good morning. I just dropped my stuff in my room, and maintenance and Donnelly are in there checking the heat. It must be 80 degrees in there. 90-minute classes. Excuse me: This time of the year, we go to 90-minute classes. Concentrated prep in math and language arts only. I don't follow. Why the heat? It's the only way the kids will sit through 90 minutes of anything. - Make them drowsy? - Right. So it's about the tests. From now until they're done, everything's about the tests. Damn! I ought to go somewhere warm for the winter. Where? I saw on "Animal Planet" marlin fishing-- Iike, Florida, the Bahamas. That shit looked sweet. The water was like this... this color, man. Man, it ain't gonna be that cold this year. - How you know? - Global warming. So why is it so cold already? Yo, we just getting old. Yeah. True that. Yo. Where the fuck you been? City jail for a day and a half till they recogged me. Then my grandma got sick, so I was over there for a while. Po-Po hit you with a charge, huh? Just a humble-- false statement and shit, for saying I wasn't who I really was. Damn, so why they was asking about you like that? Hmm-mmm. They try talking to you? Yeah, about some murder. - Which one? - It don't matter which murder because I didn't say shit to them bitches, though. Yeah, well, I ain't the one you need to convince. Why I got to convince him? You know, I'm saying, yo. Po-Po come asking about you, they snatch your ass up, you out of pocket for a few days. Heh! Oh, yeah. He'll definitely hear about it. I didn't say nothing to nobody. That's why they gave me the humble, dumped my ass in Central Booking, because I ain't say a fucking word to none of them. Yeah, so go tell him that shit. Shit, man, if it were me, I'd go to him first. Yeah, Kev, you know, definitely jump out in front of that, man, because if they got to come looking for you, it's gonna look like you got something to hide. - Definitely. - Got that "Plymouth Rock" over here. Ghetto bird special. Two for one... What you want? - Menu, yo. Give him a menu. - Oh. - What's good? - Fuck if I know. You ain't supposed to cuss at the customer, motherfucker. Kwame. Darnell. All right. Let me get... pizza. Pizza. Anything to drink? Grape soda. Quiet, please. - Is that it? - Yeah. Thank you. Say thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Menu: Don't he got to say "thank you," too? Darnell. What the fuck for? He's supposed to give it back. Because when you are polite to people, they treat you better. - Have a seat, please. - May I see you? Now you try being the waiter, and Albert, be the customer. What you want to eat? Give me some crab cakes and a coke. Hurry that shit up, too. Been on the phone nonstop with Fourth Avenue. They're insisting every class teaches to the test. Oh, God. Look. I thought we were the exception. I mean, that's the point of the project. - They know that. - No exceptions. And 90-minute blocks of math or language arts only. This class: Kids can't do 30 minutes without climbing the walls. Look. Isn't there somebody we can sit down and talk with, face to face? Actually, that's the second thing they told me. The area superintendent wants to see the two of you tomorrow morning, 9:00 in the conference room. Let's not panic... yet. Business as usual. Marlo. You no know him when we robbed the game? He ain't that bad a deuce. Boy's merely a name to me. If you knew it was Marlo, you'd still go through with it, no? I wish I'd have known. I'd have enjoyed it that much more. Bubs. It's Herc. You hungry? Yo, what you done was fucked up, man. You don't know how bad I felt when I heard. I mean, not only were you late, you just rolled right past. Ain't you see me getting beat? We rolled by? I seen you with the blue light on, man. Whatever. Look, we had a communication problem, I admit. But I'm gonna get you a phone today, and that's gonna solve it for us. You'll see. Thing is, there's this camera-- police department video camera disappeared a few weeks back. And for various reasons that I can't get into, I got to get it back somehow. Camera? Yeah. This fella Marlo probably took it. I don't know if he hocked it or if he-- You're bothering me about a camera? You supposed to have my back, remember? Five minutes, you told me. I know. I owe on the deal. It's Tyrone's, chicken wings. Here's the thing. I want you to put it out there that there's a $500 bounty on this camera if it comes back. No questions asked. 500? Swear to God. I'm good for it-- if it's the right camera. Here's the model and serial number. So it's 500 for the camera and a chicken box for Bubs, huh? It's another 100 to you if this happens. But I need this camera quick, or shit's gonna fly. Look, man, I told you, it's not about the money for me right now. All right? This motherfucker, he messing with my livelihood here. They're always coming back, always. He's like some "Terminator" and shit. I'm with you. I'm gonna do everything I can to help you out with your problem, and you're gonna help me out with mine. Who the fuck is Randy? He's a little hopper from around the way. He ain't in the game, but he be with Michael and them. And he talking to police? I know it. I know he did, because he was the one I told, "Go tell Lex to go up to the alley. Patrice is waiting." You were supposed to do that. Yeah, I know, but this way, try to keep some distance between me and Lex, right? You tell this Randy what happened to Lex? No, I swear it. Go, motherfucker. The fuck you still waiting for? - What the fuck y'all following me for? - Easy, son. No. Ain't nobody walking with me nowhere. What's up with this Randy? He can't hurt us. - He a snitch, though. - Yeah. Put that around, then. - Slim. - Marlo. - How you feeling? - Can't complain, yo. Getting to be that time, though. Joe wanted me to check in, you know? All right. Pull up a chair. Let's chop it up. Now, that there a Barksdale boy. So? Don't add up. Interesting, though. Got a burner, see? If anything else comes up, you call me. If this guy robs you again, make sure he's holding. The more, the better. Shit, I ain't got money for all that. There's 40 minutes on that, and my number's in there already. Watch. I'm gonna call you today or tomorrow at the latest. One and one. Damn, son. He did a number on you. Who was it? Officer Walker. Walker be evil. - What up? - Four. Yeah, we ought to fuck him up. Walker? Yo, he the police. I'm just saying. He said next time I steal a car, I'm gonna find myself dead. You gonna do as he say? Fuck no. Soon as I get this shit off, I'll be running his ass all over town. Yo, shit! Told you, Namond. Gave you fair warning, didn't l? - I ain't done nothing. - Get the cash. Got you cold. Shit, with hair like that, I could make you from East Baltimore. - Get the fuck off of me, man. - Shut up! - Look what I found. - That ain't fucking mine! Hands on the car! Spread your legs. - I ain't fucking got-- - Shut up! How you like it so far? Having fun? Guess what? Gets better. Give me your hands. Watch your head. Damn. Y'all not wasting any time, huh? Nerese was good enough to let us stage in the council suite till the inauguration. No doubt after your fine showing in the general. - No doubt. - 81%? 82. In a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans nine to one-- Anything less would have been an embarrassment. So... what can we do for you, Senator? Well, first of all, I wanted to clear the air. If there are any hard feelings over what happened during the primary-- You gonna give the money back? Senator, it's been a very long day. I'll cut to the chase. I understand you have a problem at the top of the police department. You asked Burrell to resign. He declined. I'm looking for a replacement. The ministers like Burrell. So does the council president. We're confident that when we identify a suitable candidate, Ms. Campbell and the ministers will see the wisdom of new leadership. Except y'all need to get a pay raise through the city council. Pay raise would help. I can ask Nerese about that pay raise getting passed, maybe convince some of the ministers they need to move on from Burrell. Situation would have to be resolved sooner rather than later. Do my best, partner. And what do we do for you in return? I'm in Annapolis. Word I'm hearing, you may be there too, in a couple of years. We may find ourselves working together closely. Thanks for your time. Jesus Christ. He's slick. Apologizes for the short con, and then in the next breath setting us up for the long. He and Burrell are as thick as thieves. And do we know what the long con is? At least we know he's running one. Shiiiii... Try calling again. Man, I know she not gonna answer. My moms don't answer when she go to A.C. When she coming back? She going to New York after. What's she doing in New York? Shopping. Going to see some show, "The Color Purple." See, now this is where my job gets good. You could reach a guardian, we both know the juvenile master's gonna recog you on a first-time drug arrest. But now you'd better have a toothbrush on you, son, because it's gonna be baby booking tonight. Namond, you scared? I mean, if it was Cheltenham, I don't blame you, but baby booking's just across town. The East Side be beefing with the West Side in there. There's some dudes be getting raped and shit. I mean, that's what I be hearing. It's bad in there. I don't know if it's that bad. Well, I hear different. You got no other family? I got a aunt down in P.G. County. You got a number? Well, I ain't driving you this late, anyway, so-- Come on, man. Tell you what: two of my guys are working a double, working midnight shift tonight. If you can plant yourself on that bench over there, you can stay here for the night. But first thing tomorrow, you got to raise that aunt or raise your moms, or I got to process you. You don't move off that bench. You need the bathroom, you go now. Otherwise, just... sit tight, don't give anybody any trouble, or they'll process you right then and there. I'm cool. Thanks. Fucking charity ward here. I'll go tell the shift commander. Yo, Lieutenant... He a 50: No. Probably copping it for my moms. That's why? Look. I told y'all, I just want him gone. I just want him away from me and Bug. The fuck he do to you? All right. We'll take care of it, boss. Another church burglary in sector two last night. Madison Park Methodist. This would be what you'd call a rash. And we could use some ointment. We need to arrest these fucks. We getting anywhere on that? Not yet. Who caught the last one? McNulty? - Working it. We should talk. - All right. Speaking of arrests, word from on high is to sweep corners. They want arrests to double over the next month. How the fuck how: Jesus, I thought the election was over. Bosses want quality-of-life violations. What are we talking about, Lieutenant, loitering? Disorderlies, public indecency. Oh, this is horseshit. - Broken-windows theory. - Worked in New York. Case you ain't noticed, this ain't New York. But it could work here. - Never has. - Never been done right. Open containers, too. - What's wrong with writing a ticket? - More of that, too. The word is, the commissioner himself wants to juke arrests. Open container used to be sacrosanct in this town. Long as it was in a paper bag. They gave you that much respect. Man's beverage was his business. You took them to a restaurant? Yeah. Ruth Chris. Linen napkins. Yeah. Silverware, more than one fork. How'd they do? Eh, pretty well, considering. Did they embarrass us? Us? No, uh... we're fine with it, but, uh... I mean, they were intimidated, embarrassed, and awkward as hell, but they made it through. Ms. Shepherdson, these aren't the kids that are gonna be able to sit still for the statewide tests, much less do well on them. These were the kids that were gonna make it impossible for anyone else to do well. So we're writing them off? No, that's what we're not doing. You're not educating them. You're socializing them. They weren't being educated before. There's no point in being obtuse. - Excuse me: - Hold on. Hold on. Look. What he's saying is this: I mean, you put a textbook in front of these kids, put a problem on a blackboard, or teach them every problem on some statewide test, it won't matter, none of it, because they're not learning for our world, they're learning for theirs. And they know exactly what it is they're training for and what it is everyone expects them to be. I expect them to be students. But it's not about you or us, or the tests or the system. It's what they expect of themselves. I mean, every single one of them know they headed back to the corners. Their brothers and sisters-- shit, their parents-- they came through these same classrooms, didn't they? We pretended to teach them, they pretended to learn, and where-- where'd they end up? Same damn corners. I mean, they're not fools, these kids. They don't know our world, but they know their own. I mean, Jesus, they-- they see right through us. I think we made that clear when you approved the project. Provisionally approved. When you provisionally approved the project, we made it clear that we would be addressing children that required socialization before they could be properly educated. We can't lie. Not to them. Captain, line three. Roll call's over. You get a line on your mother yet? Fucking neglect case here, I want it. How about that aunt: Ain't nobody else you know? No other responsible adult? Like who: I don't know. I'm just trying to give you one last shot here because once I go on the street today, you're gonna have to go to booking. I got a teacher. Mr. Colvin. You know him? He used to be police. Tall: Bald: Yeah. Yeah, I know him. What if you get the one snitch? The one with the cart. What's his name? Bubbles. Bubbles. Yeah. You get Bubbles to say he's Fuzzy Dunlop. Except Bubbles has been a registered Cl for years. Kima gave him a number back when she was in plainclothes, man. And, Herc, you worked with him under that number on the Barksdale stuff. So how would you fuck up the lD? Fuck me, man. Look. The only way to get out from under this is to stop fucking lying, okay: You grab your dick, you walk into Marimow's office, and you say, "Lieutenant, I made a mistake. "l attributed my PC to an informant when in fact I had it off a camera." That I got from lSD without going through the proper channels. No no no. He's gonna take my stripes on this. Maybe he does, but if you wait until lSD comes looking for that camera and he figures out the lie for himself, he takes your fucking balls. Come on! Let's go! Around the corner. Got you now, motherfucker. In going over some of my paperwork, it occurs to me I may have been neglectful. Look at all this crap! Every day, more and more of Lester Freamon's bullshit washes up with us. What the fuck are you saying? That my paperwork may have been a little sloppy, and as a result, I confused myself on some things. No shit, you were sloppy. I actually went back a couple weeks on your run sheets. Nothing there references a meet with a Cl 238. You went through all my run sheets? The best I could. Sir, listen-- I don't care who it is. Turn that fucking thing off. I am starting to believe that this Fuzzy fella doesn't exist. I am starting to believe that you just followed Stanfield into the train station and grabbed the first broad he brushed up against. - That what happened? - No. No, sir. You lie to me now, Sergeant, and I guaran-fucking-tee you I will jam you up, ship this whole mess to llD and be there to pass out sandwiches at your execution. Yes, sir. You haven't brought me a case yet worth talking about, not on Marlo Stanfield, not on anyone. You bring me something other than llD complaints, and I might have some reason to let a few things slide. Mad at me: Come on, now. Dukie's just mad at everybody. Ha ha ha! Snitch bitch. Yo, what the fuck was that? I don't know. I can't believe y'all are doing this shit. You're degrading the quality of life in this neighborhood. Malt liquor. Oh, come on, man! Brother, you got to shake hands with a pilsner, maybe a nice tail ale. Hell, what-- oh, man! My brew! My shoes! God! Man. What's the violation? Parking in a bus stop, expired registration. First-class police work, Baker. Yeah, well, this is the word from up on high, straight from the eighth floor downtown. Blessed bosses juking stats for the new administration. I know you think it's bullshit, but I spend my shift where they tell me. Baker, let me tell you a little secret: A patrolling officer on his beat is the one true dictatorship in America. We can lock a guy up on a humble; we can lock him up for real; or we can say, fuck it-- pull under the expressway and drink ourselves to death, and our side partners will cover it. So no one-- and I mean no one-- tells us how to waste our shift. Pulled the reports on those church burglaries. - Yeah? - Yeah. There's a pattern. Times and locations. They're working west by northwest through Sandtown-Winchester. The last three-- here, here, and here-- these ones in blue are the churches they haven't hit closest to the ones they have. You got all this from the incident reports? That's why we do the paperwork. Giving me a motherfucking ticket, man? Are you out of your motherfucking mind? I live here, man! This could get out of hand. That's what we want, isn't it? More arrests? Come on. No justice, no peace. It'll only be for tonight. Mama gets back from New York tomorrow. Your call. The young man seems to think highly of you, boss. He invoked your name with a measure of respect. It wasn't but a few weeks ago I was in a room with him being called everything but a child of God. "Mr. Colvin, sir. Fuck you." Yeah, well, at least I said, "Mr." So what was the charge? Slinging. He'd been out there a few weeks or so. First pop, second warning from me. Maybe you should put him on the juvenile bus. He wants so bad to be a gangster, maybe it's time he get a taste of what a real lockup's all about, you know? Come on, Mr. C., don't do me like that. I made him sleep on the DEU bench last night, if that counts for anything. Isn't there anybody else? Friend, relative, anybody? You've always been good with the knuckleheads, boss. Ahh. All right. Let me go call my wife. Yeah. Go up in that building. Mmm, man, that was delicious. There's more. Uh, no, ma'am. Saving room for the cobbler. A la mode? Huh: Would you like ice cream on it? Oh! Oh, yes, ma'am. Nice manners. From what you told me on the phone, Bunny, I was expecting more of an adventure. Bunny? Only my friends call me Bunny. - Yeah, but why? - You don't need to know. And if you tell anybody, I'll cut your balls off. I'll cut them off, give 'em to Donnelly in a jar. Don't doubt me, boy. You ain't got no kids? Grown. They're at college and past that. You told me these kids were rough. Thank you, sweetie. But don't be fooled. This is his Eddie Haskell act. Eddie Haskell? Who that? You are, son. Trust me. Take a seat. Put yours against the wall with the others. Welcome wagon's on their way back from booking. - We need the key to the interview room. - What the fuck for? Felony burglary. Felony? Caught them coming out of St. Martin's on Fulton. Charging them with the one, but we might work back on a few more. No shit: Fucking knew there was still some real criminals left in Baltimore. Swear to God, I'm seeing citations for jaywalking. We're locking people up for open container, for disorderly, for loitering. The neighborhood people, sometimes they appreciate quality-of-life arrests. Except we're locking up the neighborhood people. Some of my guys, all they see are the stats. I mean, the election's fucking over, right? Who are we doing this for? Is this coming from Burrell or Rawls? We got it from the chief of patrol. It's rolling downhill, for sure. Morale: Split down the middle, I'd say. The officers that love the stat are jazzed. The rest of them: We don't know where to turn. I thought a new hump as mayor might change this shit, not ramp it up. Hey, you still fucking that bitch? Yeah. It burning like hell, man. When you gonna burn the bitch back? Oh, check it. Slim. B. What up: All right. - Poot. - It's good. - Heard you're out. - Yeah. - Welcome home. - Thanks, dawg. And you with Prop Joe now. Never would have thought. Yeah, well, life's strange. Yeah. Holler. Bodie... how you and Marlo? You okay with him? As far as I know, yeah. Why? What he did to your boy. What boy are you talking? Big boy, the one rub his hands together all the time? Kevin: What about him: You ain't heard? Chris and Snoop walked him down an alley. He in a vacant now. How you know that? I seen them lay hands on the boy. And now the word out on the street. Sorry, dawg. Let's roll. Plymouth Rock. Got that Plymouth Rock. All right. But now look at the next example question on page 20. As you can see... if you turn to page 20, they will sometimes ask you for words that are the opposite of words that are underlined. Uh, thank you, Mr. Pryzbylewski. Thank you. All right, put away your test notebooks. Work on those tomorrow. We have, uh, 45 minutes left. We can do "Last of the Mohicans"-- - No! - No! Or practice probabilities. - Yeah. - Yes. - I'll get the stuff, Mr. Prezbo. - All right. And I want to see everybody's worksheets out. Hey, Kareem, you want to play dice with me? Not with you. And we're not just playing games here. We're doing math. I'll roll with you, man. Come on. No kidding. We are. That's my boy resting his head, see? Mmm. Hey, Renaldo, you want one? No. They're from Faidley's, yo. He might stay home all day, you know? We gonna find out, ain't we? - Like to see about my DSS code. - Do you have an appointment? Why I need an appointment? Zenobia, I don't think she needs an appointment. Sorry, just trying to make it realistic. So I get to see somebody? You're gonna have to take a number and wait. I need to see somebody right now. Don't get angry. Anger doesn't help. It just makes people defensive. Tell her what you need calmly. - Card didn't come this month. - We mailed it. - Maybe it got stolen. - Heh. Sorry. Nothing we can do. - Fuck you. - Chandra! - She ain't helping me. - That's how they do. Just tell her what you need. - Need another card, bitch. - Chandra. And that's reality. Fuck you for real. - Oh! - Oh! Calm down. Calm down. Go with Ms. Mason. - Get your hands off! - Ms. Mason! I'll get the school police. She was like... And then-- and then-- and then she was like... Typical day? I wouldn't know. My first time. Your first time? Mrs. Donnelly oversees this project. Okay. Good morning, ladies. Help a man get something to eat? God bless. Good morning, Reverend. Yo. Glad you finally answered. Yeah, I was in a meeting yesterday. You got the asshole pinned down? Nah, I got Marlo's people-- getting ready to make a drop. - Where? - Edmondson, near Pulaski. You eyeballing them right now? Yeah, he got the package. Black bag, putting it in the trunk. - He getting in right now. - What make? Late model Lincoln. You want the license? - Yeah, give it. - P-R-8-Z-G-O-D. Yeah. Yeah, he pulling out now, turning down Gilmore. Dozerman, get me Foxtrot. Good job, Bubs. We're on it. Ladies, a cell phone? It's got, like, a half hour on it. No thank you. What I saw today wasn't education as I understand the term, and they didn't seem very socialized, either. You didn't catch us on our best day. Or your worst day? On the whole, they've actually made a lot of progress. Look, I mean, they come to class, they're more engaged. We're reaching them. Fewer outbursts, no suspensions. But are they really learning anything? Yes. We believe they are. Be truthful. If this program were to continue through the rest of the school year, how many of your students could realistically be expected to return to a regular classroom? What do you think, Ms. Duquette? Namond, Darnell, maybe Zenobia. Yeah, look. I mean, considering where we started and considering that those kids ain't out there tearing up other classes-- Okay. Mrs. Donnelly. A tremendous achievement. Mr. Withers: I'll go along with Mrs. Donnelly. You haven't said anything yet. I just don't see it. Many of these kids are profoundly damaged-- what they've seen, how they've lived. And I think any gain or progress is temporary. I think this project may be flawed. Foxtrot 23-30. We have a visual on the suspect. Vehicle headed east on Mulberry. Do you copy? - 10-4. We're almost there. - 10-4. After your phone call, I checked. It came directly from Burrell. He bypassed Rawls after l specifically told him he was-- Burrell's making a play for you to keep him. By, uh, just-- what did you call that? Juking the stats. Guy is unbelievable. It runs completely counter to all my discussions with Rawls, with you, with everyone. He's also serving notice. He's reasserting control of the department. He probably figures if you can't fire him, then you can't fire him. And does Rawls know? My guess is, Rawls heard about it days ago from half a dozen district commanders. Why wouldn't he come to me? Talk to him. Why did you come to me? I mean, why not go to Rawls? Because I need to know if you're serious. If Rawls already came to you and this shit is still going on, then you're okay with it, which is for me a problem. If he didn't come to you, then either he's okay with it, which is also a problem, or he's letting it go, trying give Burrell enough rope for you to get angry and fire the man for insubordination. But I need to know where you stand. Well, I gave you my word. Yes. You did. Well, thanks for going outside the chain of command. Don't expect me to make a habit of it. Stay in the car! Stay in the car. Keep your hands on the wheel. - Let's see those hands. - What's the problem, Officer? Step slowly out of the vehicle. Keep your hands up. Son, be gentler than that. Shut the fuck up. I ain't your son. This guy... What's this, huh? What's this? Do you know what? I'm gonna damn sure get your name and badge number. Daniels. I don't think I know him. Oh, he hasn't played much politics, though he used to be married to the new councilwoman in the 11th. - Marla Daniels: - Mm-hmm. That's the one. This is the last man we want as police commissioner, Nerese. I mean, I squared off against this fellow a few years back, and he wouldn't listen to me. He's not gonna listen to you or the ministers or anyone else in the community. - Just Carcetti? - Mm-hmm. Oh, he's the mayor's boy, definitely. Carcetti is looking for how much of a salary bump? 50,000, at least, to make the position competitive nationally. Give him 25. It'll be enough to make him think he'll win you over eventually but less than he needs to entice anyone real. Meanwhile, Carcetti's gonna have to give Daniels six months in ClD before he can bump him again, for appearance's sake. So we're buying time here. Enough for Ervin to show the new mayor who butters the bread. And for events to take the new-penny shine off Cedric Daniels. I happen to know he's less the saint than he pretends to be.
