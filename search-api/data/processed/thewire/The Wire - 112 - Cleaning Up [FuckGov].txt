Go on in. No. Unfreeze your ass off that wall, then. Either pay your respects, or get your head back into this case. -Fuck this case. -Fuck it? Now you're just gonna, what, call off your little crusade? Is that what you think it was? A crusade? Avon Barksdale was a way to show everyone how smart I was... and how fucked up the department is, that's all. Just put Jimmy McNulty up on your shoulders... march him around the room, break out the keg. It was never about Avon Barksdale, Lieutenant. It was all about me. You think I didn't know that? You think we all didn't know? Listen, this case is gonna move forward... with you or without you. This case got her shot. I put a battery up her ass... and got her thinking this case meant something. And you know what? Burrell, Rawls, and them, they were right. This case means exactly shit. I know it meant damn near nothing to me when you came in beating the drum. But now we got that woman in there, that good police... breathing through a fucking tube, because it meant something to her. And the shooters who dropped Kima? They're still in the wind. And whoever sent those motherfuckers into that alley... he needs to get got, too. So you can stand there, dripping with liquor-smell and self-pity... if you got a mind to, but this case... it means something. Now. You hit them again? I been calling them all morning. They ain't hit me back yet. Damn, we gonna tap out by noon. Poot! What we got over there? 200, maybe. What the fuck is this? What the fuck you think, nigger? Fish food. Give me my shit. Heads up. String. I need your pagers. All of y'all, the whole crew. -Who else? -Sterling, Cass and Manny. -All right, go get them shits. -How am I gonna talk to my girl? Talk to your hand, nigger, that's the only girl you got. No more.... Get out of here. Just get the fuck out of here, man. No more pagers. Touts, lookouts, off the air, all right? Nobody gonna use these cell phones except for you and Bodie... and y'all don't say shit on these, you understand me? We got the numbers and we the only niggers that need them. Not your moms, not your girl, nobody. You feel me? You use these phones to set up a meet, go to that meet... and talk face to face, period. -So no more pay phones? -You deaf? I said no phones. How I'm gonna reach y'all? All right, top number's for re-ups... second number's for muscle. You need me, hit me on the third number. Learn them shits, then throw that shit away. -You doing this in the towers, too? -Doing it everywhere. Pagers, pay phones is dead. -All right? -Yeah. String. We need some re-up, man, we gonna tap out by noon. Re-up from where? You niggers ain't heard? Knockos took the main stash. Why the fuck you think we changing up? Back the fuck up, young'un. These shits ain't for you. All right. Cool. There you go. There we go. All right. The gift of corrected vision. Compliments of the BPD. -Dang, y'all are focused. -What man wouldn't be? They been cleaning us for the past few days. -Last night they burned us all the way. -I knew it. I fucking knew it. I swear to God, I'm in this motherfucker's head. Not a message since early morning. Shit, I even had to cut Prez loose. -Send his ass on down to Annapolis. -For what? State campaign finance reports. I checked all the stuff here. But I got the feeling Barksdale's money has legs. Shit. All the work we did to get up on this fucking wire. You don't hit these guys and expect them to stay in the pocket. -Plus, they know they dropped a police. -Then we need to change up, too. Come on. Shardene! Honey, this is Detective McNulty, who's working with us. She works at Orlando's, helping us out there from time to time. And now I think that she can see well enough... to match faces to voices. Lester, look, I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm scared of this shit. Time comes, though, I know you gonna step up. We're gonna need Pearlman to approve her wearing a wire. -Can I get a cup of coffee? -What do you take in it? I'll get it. A little cream, right? Those knockos motherfuckers cleaned my shit out. -You can replace product and currency. -Yeah, he right. -We gotta focus on what's real, here. -All of this shit is real. They wanna put me in a box. Listen, I think what's important is to take stock. Ask yourself what's out there that can still hurt you. Where are you weak? Where you need to clean up? Think it through. Start with Orlando, if Orlando rolled. You know he talked about the club, at least. That punk-ass nigger ain't talk about shit else but the club. That's all he knew about. He wasn't rolling with us. We kept him on the outside. So you walk away from the club. You're not on the license, you're not a listed owner. They can't make a connect. When did this shit start up? About the time that your nephew beat that charge. After, maybe when they found that witness with the lead in his dome... the shit hit the newspapers. But around that time, the cops was on our shit. The security guard, the one whose testimony sprung D'Angelo-- -Nakeisha Lyles? -Yeah. Bug-eyed ass bitch. But we hooked that up. -So she can still hurt you, right? -Yeah. The point is anybody who can hurt you can be put into play. -The less I hear, the better. -All right, yo. Hey, yo, lock that door? So we got Bird and Bey. -Bird will stand tall. -He already in jail, and Bey about to go, too. And Wee-Bey hard like a rock. And we got Savino. Savino know it ain't nothing but an Arm and Hammer charge. I mean, he ain't gonna flip out over a motherfucking three years. True. Then we got that shit with Orlando, and the only problem there was Little Man. Was. Who else? It's over, your wire's cold. The court orders give me a total of 90 days on five phones. I'm doing the full 90. You want to sit listening to a bunch of broke-ass pay phones, have at it. But you don't need all that manpower to do it. You want some bodies back, I'll send a couple, no problem. Hold on, Lieutenant. I gave you those people. I decide who comes back. But feel free to speak your mind, if it were up to you. He asked you a question, Lieutenant. I have no opinion. Take your pick. What's the name of that old detective from Pawnshop? And that young one, Valchek's brain-dead son-in-law. Freamon, Pryzbylewski. Keep them. Send back Sydnor and Santangelo. And, Lieutenant, if you want to do anything beyond... Iisten to those dead phones... you need to brief me first. You did good, Cedric. You play your cards right, all the work you did over the past few months... will speak volumes for you. And Maj. Spurgeon is saying that he's retiring at the end of November. Which opens up the Northwest Command. That's right. Hi, Ronnie. Come in. Sit. -Sheila, send Patrick in. -Yes, sir. -Anything up? -With me? Same shit, different file. -How about the Barksdale thing? -You've got my office reports? Wire's dead, but we're looking into a bug in the man's nightclub. Aside from that, you're doing what? Pulling campaign finance reports for every politician... in the city of Baltimore, right? I am? We are? And making calls to some contributors... asking questions, doing background checks. I don't know anything about this. I mean, Ronnie, where the fuck is all this going? Those are public reports, right? I mean.... No one on that detail has come to me for any kind of subpoena. You got back-doored, too? Just so there's no misunderstanding... I want to give you this. Copies of checks on the account of my re-election committee... representing the return of five separate contributions... totaling $4,500. Also copies of the checks... from the donor are represented in there, too. Kind of like Caesar's wife and all that shit. The only thing that we could come up with were those five checks. And I don't know those people, and I don't know why they gave. That money's gonna be returned to the donors immediately. Guys, listen to me. I don't know a fucking thing... about anyone looking at campaign contributions. Be that as it may... this should make it clear that our hands are clean. Ronnie, I want you to take that back to whoever's on the hunt... and I want you to tell them they've got no quarrel with me. What's up, String? So y'all want to get with me? Yeah, we need to holler at your boy... you know, the one that dimed on Omar's bitch. Can't recall his name. Which one? The one that was at the Greek's that night. -And we paid him for the lookout. -What y'all need him for? What's it to you? -You ain't got to worry about him. -Say what? He's gone, he's out the game. Out the game? Yo, the man asked you a simple question. I don't mean y'all no disrespect. You know I don't. I am sitting here telling you that the boy is out the game. And even if he wasn't out the game, he wouldn't be no problem. But you know we just want to talk to him, Dee. Let the boy be. Just let him be. Honey, just leave the damn thing alone. -Where'd you get these, man? -Prevas. Broadway market? -Best chili dogs in the city. -No, man, not even. I'll give you $10 if you can name a better dog. -George's Lunch on Light Street. -The Greek joint? That place closed back when you were still sucking on your mama's nipples. My mama's nipples? I was sucking on them plums last night. You owe me $10. I said, name a better dog you can have today, not in world history. -You just said a better dog. -You go get that dog right now. -You cannot go get that now. -And you tell me... -the best fucking dog. -Physically-- Can you please keep it down? I can't hear a goddamn thing! You'd know how much I got... if you laid something on me. -You like that freeze? -If you holding. I'm fixing to be. That's why I'm here, you know? To discuss some things. When you done discussing, you come back. All right, then. Hold that pose right there, shorty. I'm gonna hook you up with some uncut. Y'all niggers talk too damn much, man. Who the fuck is she? Housing police? No, she's one of them civilians they got doing security. -Housing cops wear the gray uniforms. -So she's not armed or nothing. Do she look it? You leaving early? I was early, I worked the lunch crowd. She's out. -Anything? -Table scraps. What we want is being said in that office. There's no reason for Shardene to be in there long enough for us to get it. -Take it out, I can't do this anymore. -You won't have to, darling. I think they'll look at me and know. I need to quit. I don't need you wearing this wire, all right, honey? I just need you to go in there and do one more thing. Look at this country nigger. -Damn, Wallace. -Wally! He kept crying till I sent him bus money. All right. I just got tired of that same old country scenery. It was just too slow for me. Yeah, but did you get some of that country ass? And if he did, it was on four legs. Nigger, they got no farms down there, man, but they did have some Bamas though. They got their Saturday night shit down at Sears. -They was like, you know-- -Tears, right? You were about to cry. That where you got them Die-Hards? -Man, these Timbs. -Yeah, they Timbs. I can see the tree on the side of them. So you gonna put me back on the money? Hold. Look, if we do put you back on... you have to start as lookout, man. You lost your spot when you bucked town, dawg. Come on, a real man would stay with his people... he wouldn't run at the first sight of some blood. Y'all can still holler 5-0, right? If he want back on the money, he back on the money. If he want it. My man might be thinking of going back to Edmondson... Iike we talked about, right? Come on, nigger, let's walk. Dawg, you ain't cornholed no animal for real, did you? -Go ahead, Poot. -You're stupid. Don't be fucking with my Sean John. -So who caught it? -Garvey. He knows about the whole witness angle... but he doesn't want to run it up to the bosses until he knows more. Why ace Nakeisha Lyles now? Because now they know we're for real. Avon's cleaning house all the way. First the phones go dead and then anyone he thinks... we might be able to flip. What about the boy? Fuck me. We took him to the shore Friday and the plan was to bring him back up... -on the Monday for the grand jury. -And what happened? -Greggs got shot. -Trooper Reese? This is Lieutenant Daniels with the Baltimore Department. Is there someone that can go near Cambridge... check on a kid we got stashed down there? -Call him. -No, there's no phone there. -Can you hang on? -I'll hold, yeah. Have Sydnor pull a car from motor pool. We get the kid back up here tonight, he sleeps on my sofa... and we grand-jury him in the morning. -What about your stripper? -The woman's got heart. I mean, I want her protected. No more bodies, hear? I got room at my place, she can lay up with me. -I got no problem with that. -Remember who you are, Detective. Protect and serve, Lieutenant. I'm saying, this here game, it ain't gonna work for you no more, man. You leaving, you stirred up some shit. -I'm saying it ain't your fault. -Dee, look. I appreciate what you trying to say and all, but I grew up in the courts, all right? I been with them niggers since forever. This is home, right? You ain't hearing me, Wallace. Anybody asks you whether you in this game... you tell them you in it for life, all right? You play it hard, you play it tight... and make sure niggers know you gonna stand by your people. No loose talk, no second thoughts, and no snitching. Play it like that. -What you doing down in the PJ's, you lost? -I'm looking for you. -You know I be down here working. -A working man got to eat. -My favorite spicy fish cakes? -On the saltines with the mustard. You gonna make me cry, you know. I need to get up out of here and get back to it. -You be safe. -You, too. All right. This here. Sterling's, baby, we're about to feast. What the hell is Sterling's? Sterling's, up on 29th Street? Don't you know nothing? Shit, if it ain't up on the Westside, I don't know shit. 'Cause this shit... this is me, yo, right here. Who was that, your new girl or something? No, nigger, that's my mom. You know Senator Davis? No, sir. Lieutenant. Clay wanted to meet you, see if there was any help he can offer. Help? Your people are apparently pulling finance reports... and checking up on some of the contributors. I wanted to reassure you on that front. I'm not involved in drugs, Lieutenant. Good. And this business with the senator's driver. Mr. Price, Damien. Day-Day. This business with Mr. Price, this is a misunderstanding... that is really of no concern to the police. He had $20,000 of cash on him... delivered out of a project tower by a known drug suspect. The money was banded and manicured by denomination. There's no crime here. That was money that Damien already had on him... when he drove down to Franklin Terrace. Money from a cash-bar fundraiser the previous weekend. We filed an amended finance report that shows-- Fine. There's no probable cause for a search of Mr. Price. I think we are in agreement on that. No, there was PC for the search. You're saying you have evidence that a senatorial aide is involved in drugs? I'm saying we had reason to stop Mr. Price... and effect a body search, after which we discovered... $20,000 in cash in banded, manicured bills. That's all I'm saying. Will you explain to this motherfucker just what it is he's doing here? -Lt. Daniels-- -Excuse me, sir. But it's pretty basic. If the senator is not involved in anything illegal... then he doesn't need to worry. I can't be any clearer about it than that. Fool, what do you think? That we know anything about who gives money? That we give a damn about who they are or what they want? We have no way of running down them or their stories. We don't care. We just cash the damn checks, count the votes, and move on. Anything else, Deputy Burrell? Gentlemen. You need to put his ass on a foot post so far out in the sticks... that he's gonna see the Philadelphia cops walking towards him. Now you just ain't talking to me now, Erv. You talking to the Mayor... the city caucus, the state central committee. And right now, you got your hand in our pocket. Eighteen, baby! Eighteen with a bullet, baby. Det. Sgt. Hauk reporting for duty, sir. And the best part? Carver's 37. You know, it helps if you know them by the numbers. It makes you sound more professional. Fucking Carver... he gets back from in-service training, he's gonna kiss the stripes... I'm gonna make him kiss the stripes. -Congratulations. -Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. -Sgt. Hauk? -God help us. -Daniels. -Daniels, this is Trooper Reese. Grandmother says this kid's been gone two days. Wallace is out of pocket. Two days. -Thanks. -Yeah. Ain't no re-up in the towers, neither? Shop dead, yo. -What up, man? -Same old. What's up with that boy? He's just a punk, that's all. Dee put him back on count though. Word? I heard he was out the game. He was, but he back now. Where he been at? Down his granny house, he says. Right, his granny house. I heard he damn near shit his pants... when he saw what happened to Omar's bitch. He just ain't built for this, you know. His heart pump Kool-Aid. Right. What about you? You built for this shit? No doubt. You ready to put the work in? You got heat? All right, soldier. It's clear upstairs. No extension cords. No juice boxes. No Wallace. Dang, boy, Chink Bob's... never be putting no napkins in the bag. Motherfucker, because napkins expensive and shit. So is my money. All right, come on, go. Something to eat? Y'all know what's here. Let's go, y'all need to get up in this Chinese food... 'cause, you know, I'm looking kind of needy right about now. What you listening to? Hold up, take them plates first. Big Tymers, their new video on 106th and Park. -106th and Park? -The joint is vicious. -Yeah. -For real? -What they call you? -Buff, 'cause I got the stuff. You got the stuff? Buff, you need to get up in these egg rolls or something. Buff, you need to get up in these egg rolls or something. Any word on the kid? I rolled around Cambridge all night with his B of l. If he's down there, he ain't got no profile. We got lookouts to every car in the Western and Central. We're trying for an address on his mother. -Detective. -Lieutenant. Wire's dead... so we've been ordered to begin sending bodies home. Sydnor, we have a little longer, because Cantrell still owes me. -You okay with Rawls? -I gave him his clearance, right? What's he gonna do to me? Keep it warm, Sanny. What's that? Plans for what is now Orlando's. The upper floors. This is the property next door. -How'd you get them so quick? -CoStar search. Plan is to get a remote mike into the office. Maybe even some fiber-optics. Only we don't know where Avon's office is yet. Which is where Shardene helps us out in a big way. What she gonna do? Take out a tape and ask Avon to hold the other end? Ain't none of y'all ever been in the military? How do you learn a 30-inch, quick-time? Draft-dodging peace-freaks. -Get me a ruler and some string. -Why me? Why? -Because the man said so, that's why. -Wallace ain't no snitch. Man, how you know? How you know where he been running to? He was getting high. I've seen him cop. He probably went down to the shore to clean that shit up. Man, if he using, then you know he ain't reliable. Come on, think. Look, the man gave the word, all right? We either step up or we step the fuck off. That's the game. That's the fucking game. Cedric. You ever hear of an elected official in Baltimore giving money back? Whatever you're doing scared my boss shitless. He calls me in and hands me that. Forgive me for prying into the details of our investigation. I know, it's annoying. But what the hell are you guys doing? Yeah? Is that Avon's money? Eastside addresses... but maybe Barksdale has fronts we don't know about. -State's attorney's returning this? -Fast as he can. Y'all are stirring some shit here. Why didn't you tell me? Aren't you better off that we didn't? I remember my mom used to bring me here. We used to go to a place called Fruit Fantasy. -Like orange soda, some shit like that? -No, these shits was fresh. My mom used to pour mad Bacardi in hers though. Wasn't much she didn't pour it into. Look at you, talking about your mama like you're still a kid. I got to thinking on her. Your ass ain't got to be hard all the goddamn time, neither. Soft link break the chain. What are you, a boy or a man? I'm a man. So what are we gonna do, man, go have some fun? Okay, on this floor. It's the second room from the rear. The stairs start 30 paces from the front... there's 24 stairs, about a foot each. When you get to the top floor... it's eight paces to the door of the dressing room... and then another 10 to the back room. 80 to 1 10 in from the front. Third floor of this building is vacant. Otherwise we'd need a warrant. -$15. -Here take $10. -$15. -Motherfucker, I don't see no meter. Get the fuck out of here. It's 2:30 in the morning. Easy now. Hole only needs to be as big as your finger. Not those Esskay sausage-looking fingers you got. You know what big hands mean. You know what big hands mean, right? Lieutenant... I just pulled a fresh address for Wallace's mother. We're okay here. Where y'all at? All right, when I find y'all, y'all gonna get it. You better come out now. Where y'all at? Look, I'm not even playing with y'all right about now. You hear me? Game over. Where the fuck y'all at? When I find y'all, I'm beating your asses. Now where y'all at? Don't let me find y'all. Check this, Poot. Little Man left his player and shit. You a weak-ass nigger, man. You should've stayed down in the country, man. Y'all my niggers, yo. You fucking brought this on yourself. -We boys! -You brought this on yourself. Why it gotta be like this? You my niggers from B.C., remember that? Come on, wetting your fucking pants, like you a little boy. Be a man! Stand up like a motherfucking man. -Y'all my niggers. -You said you a fucking man. -Stand up straight! -That's us, man. Do it goddamnit, if you.... Darcia Wallace? We're looking for your son. Thought you might help us out as to his whereabouts. Where-a-who? Shit, I be looking for that smart little nigger, too. Boy took me for $10. -Recently? -What's going on out there? Nothing. Couple of police interrupting me, while I'm trying to get my drink on. Your son might be in some danger. He gonna be in some danger right here if he shows up. Snatched that $10 out my purse without asking. -I'll slap the bright out his eyes. -Here's my card. You run into him, you call me. -Y'all got ajeep? -Over there, man. All right, let's see what we got here. He's packing shit up. What you scratching your head for, man? How y'all get the safe in here, and you can't get it out? Just dial 91 1 and talk to whoever pick up. Don't say your name or nothing. Just say there's been an animal hurt inside the house... and then you hang up. What up? So what do you need from me? I need you to run up to N. Y.C. to pick up a little something. Look, I know we tapped and all. Shit, everybody waiting on the re-up, but I never made that run before. Listen, I feel like I don't have that many people around me... I could really trust. Not like I can kin. You follow me? -All right? -How much is it? We just need to maintain. Put out enough so we can keep hold of them towers. -When? -Tonight. All right. What am I driving? -A rental, no flash. -Where from? I don't know where from, man, one of those places by the airport. -Yeah. -We got something real. -I'm on my way. -All right. Shit! -Which one? -The rental there, the Taurus. I gotta say, Lieutenant, you got mad suction with the federales. Yeah, Daniels. Where? Wallace? Poor fucking kid. With Wallace gone, that's Stringer out of the box. He was in there changing his fucking clothes. You believe that? Boy had to get himself correct. We're on. No need for an eyeball. Let the satellite do the work. How about I call my lawyer... have him explain that whole profiling thing to you? Mr. Barksdale, our tollbooth cameras... have you on the G.W. Bridge at 2310 hours... then re-entering the turnpike at the same exit... 35 minutes later. Why did you drive all the way to New York for half an hour? Step out of the car, sir. Keep your hands where I can see them. Turn around, face the car, put your hands on the roof. -Are you carrying any weapons, sir? -No. -Any knives, any needles? -No. Any illegal substances I should know about? Okay. Spread your legs back. Spread your legs back more. Okay, slowly bring your right arm around your back. Now bring the other one. -Remember me? -Lawyer. Easy. We're just getting started. Lawyer, motherfucker. Okay, so you're hard, but guess what? -I could give a fuck. -You? I'm tired of your games. What, you want me to write a letter, or some shit like that? No game we need to run. You're popped with a kilo of uncut. Not that you messed up. You did everything right. Speed limit, turn signals, working taillights. Question you gotta ask is... how'd those troopers know to pull you over? Someone else fucked up. You following me? But it's you they're gonna blame, and you who's gonna do the jolt. -Lawyer. -That'd be Levy, right? He's getting paid by your uncle, is that right? Yeah, he's looking out for your interests. More than you. Listen... I ain't saying another damn thing... to nobody but my lawyer. By the way... your boy Wallace, shot dead in the low-rises. That's how y'all take care of your own, right? You're a lying motherfucker. So what? You want me to write a letter to his mom, too? Get the fuck out of here. You didn't have to send him the way you did. In one car? He should've been trailing a mule. 95 or on the train, it don't make no difference... he shouldn't have been there alone. -Look here, Brianna-- -Ain't you ever heard of a trap-car? You send my son to New York... in a motherfucking rental... and you just let him ride with that package in the trunk? -I'm sorry-- -That won't bring him out of prison! Better make sure that Jew lawyer of yours earns his money, all right? -D'Angelo gonna have to do his part. -Meaning what? You like the car you driving there, right? You like this crib? I put you in this crib. You like it? Yeah, I mean, we all got a lot to protect here. You need to remind him of that. So when it come down to it, he can stand up tall. You ain't gotta worry about my child. I raised that boy, and I raised him right. It wasn't me who fucked up. Really? So who did? Why the fuck are we here? Listen, all you need to do is keep your head through the bail hearing. We got a good shot at bringing you home here. Then what? Who gonna take the weight for all the shit in the trunk of that car? Where's Wallace at? Where's the boy, String? D'Angelo, shut your mouth. Where's Wallace? That's all I want to know. Kid, you better think. Where the fuck is Wallace? String! Look at me! Where the fuck is Wallace? I don't want this Payless-wearing motherfucker representing me. I'm gonna get my own man, all right? So just get back in your car, and get the fuck back down south. All right, you stupid motherfucker. You made your decision. Yeah, I made my decision. Where's Wallace at? Where the fuck is Wallace? Where's Wallace, String? String, where the fuck is Wallace? Stringer! Bring him in. -You're done. -Why? We have the charge whenever we want it. Why not stay up on the bug we've got in his office? The bug you didn't brief me about. I thought your little bird told you everything we did... a minute after we did it. One of our people got hurt. That's supposed to mean something. We're hunting her shooters... and by the grace of God and your good work... we've got a viable case on our main target. Just charge Barksdale with the attempt purchase... from New York and bring it all home. What about Stringer, his number two? He slipped off the hook when we lost the boy witness. We've done all we can. Are you hearing me? These are the people responsible for dropping a police. Not just the shooters, but the ones who make the dirt happen. I'm trying to put them down for real, not for some short-time bit. That all you're trying to do? If that's all you're doing, how is it you have people... pulling campaign records and finance reports? What the fuck has that got to do with anything? The money is part of my case. There was a time when I was willing to say otherwise... to let you and all your friends hide some of that dirt, but not now. You want to talk about dirt? Have at it. Talk some shit about your Eastern district days. Talk about what was going on back when you was running wild in the DEU. -That's just talk. -Just talk? FBI field reports. You came into a lot of money, quick. And you can go to jail just as quick... if I start asking the right questions. This case ends, or you are done. Hell, I don't even need you to lock up Barksdale. I'll have your major debrief your detectives and type the warrants himself. This case is done! You do what you feel. You wanna pull Avon in on half a case? You go ahead. You wanna put my shit in the street? Feel free. But the Eastern had a lot of stories. Mine ain't the only one. A lot of people came through that district. If you were gonna do me, I'd already be done. But there ain't nothing you fear more than a bad headline now, is there? You'd rather live in shit than let the world see you work a shovel. You can order warrants, and I'll serve them. But as long as I have days left on those dead wires... this case goes on. Yo, look at these Delta Force motherfuckers, man. -Look at them. -All right. -What's up with Levy? -He said he gonna meet us down there. I still didn't get this safe out of here yet, man. How much money in it? -$150,000. -$150,000? Open it up, man. No sense in ruining a good safe. This isn't as much fun as I thought it would be. The SWAT guys do love to break out their toys. They think it's Tony Montana up there? They probably haven't touched a gun in years. Fuck this shit. You and me, Lieutenant. What units are in the alley? Any sightline to the rear door? 10-4, who has the roof? We're gonna move in on my command. Everyone stand by. We're not gonna need your men today. Call them back. -Now wait a minute-- -My case, back your men off. Catch you later. Good. Barksdale's wearing bracelets. Still no Wee-Bey, no Little Man? No, nothing there. This is the best work I ever did. I never did a case like this. But it's not enough.
