Next time you finish up the box, you need to holler on it, yo. Sí sí. Hey, y'all, it's Omar. - Omar. - There he is. - Omar step, yo. - Omar, yo. Y'all ain't got no Honey Nut? Whatever you see. And a carton of Newports. Omar comin'. Hey, y'all, here he come. Omar. Omar. Omar strollin'. They don't have the Honey Nut? - I don't even want this, dawg. - Why not? It ain't what you're taking, it's who you taking it from, you feel me? How you expect to run with the wolves come night when you spend all day sporting with the puppies? - So you staying with Royce, I see? - What you mean? Oh, man. Makes sense since I know you got your fill of Carcetti. They've been puttin' up a crop of these things on every lawn on the block. And as fast as I take 'em down, they bring more. That's what they do this time of year. I see you're at your leisure. I work two nights a week, three day shifts and no weekends. I'm off till this afternoon. You're good with it? It ain't the Hopkins gig, but it'll do. Pullin' 52, good bennies, got a take-home car. I mean the hotel manager's a pain in the ass, but still. Well, if you was a bit free, I heard something. This thing over at University of Maryland School of Social Work-- - they got a grant. Big money. - Just stop. Half a million to look at repeat violent offenders, clinical intervention-- all that mess. So they gonna study some shit, huh? Melvin, I had me a good helping of them downtown, tie-wearing, come-to-do-good, stay-to-do-well college types last year. You sure? 'Cause I sold 'em on it, should you want it. Bunny, you're a big man down on the campus. You the police that legalized it. The college boys loved that mess. Nobody else did, though. Well, I tried. You did. Yo, blacktops, pandemic. Pandemic, got that pandemic. Pandemic. My mac, pandemic, blacktops right here. That's my boy, right? Ain't taking no handouts, but he workin' for it. See what I mean? This nigga's made a little something out of this corner. Now hold on, son. We're just talking now. - All right? - Man, y'all did good with this spot. You a rightful hustler. What's your name again, man? Boney? Biddy? - What's it now? - You know my name. Yeah, but now here's the thing: With this spot all built up and shit, - we need it, yo. - Yeah. - What? - Two choices: You can start taking our packages or you can step off. My man Chris is gonna holla at you, all right? You tell him what it need to be. Don't wait for the pandemic. It's right here, y'all. Don't sleep on the pandemic. I want to know more about that boy right there. Got good signs on him. Big paws on a puppy, huh? Yeah, big paws on a puppy. To a "T." Get that blacktop before you flop. Get that pandemic. The truth is we don't know why he was killed. It could have had something to do with him being a witness or it could be unrelated. Now, whoever leaked that shit to Carcetti's camp, - they lied on us. - Yeah, well, that's it. Eight points-- close as Carcetti gets. He wants to go big dick with me? I'll show him what he can't handle. We put it out there: Anyone contributing to both sides gets frozen out of my next term. - No one rides the middle anymore. - Done. Next, I want DPW and HCD out there today tearing down all Carcetti's signs. Any lamppost, median, any city-owned buildings, unless the homeowner's out there arguing, - tear it down. - Done. Third, I want transpo camped outside of Carcetti's headquarters. Any car, any violation, the meter flag goes up, - inspection sticker-- tow it. - Done. Next, you two, slow it down. Nothing else comes out about that murder until after the primary. And I want both of you to go to the press and talk down that witness angle. Take the full weight either way it goes. Clarence, I'm running dead even with Bond right now. How are you gonna be running if I drop you from the ticket? Okay, that's it. Thank you, gentlemen. Go to it. Now. - Mr. Mayor. - Mm-hmm. - What? - Carcetti has a point. I went down to Annapolis, got matching funds for witness protection. You didn't earmark a dime to put 'em into play. - Next fiscal year. - Don't claim poverty on this. We're only talking a quarter of a million. I match those funds now and that motherfucker Carcetti, he's got a campaign highlight: "Tommy Carcetti expands witness protection program. Fought for and won extra funds." Hell with that! I go after that state-match funds after the election. Naw naw, I paid for three pills. Look, blue shirt gets two. - Naw, I get two. - White shirt gets one. - Cheatin' motherfucker. - I get four. Look, blue shirt gets two, white one, no shirt one. Now y'all can take what y'all paid for and walk away or just walk away with nothing. Motherfuck a refund. No, nigga, I paid for three. You need to rethink what putting a hand on me's gonna get you. You can thank your friend here for snatching away y'all highs. Yo yo, hold up, hold up. Can I get my two? Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. You don't rattle. Yo, you come up under my wing, young'un, you ain't gonna do nothin' but rise, man. I don't even know why you thinkin' about quittin'. Look, man, like I already told you-- I'm all the way repaid, and tomorrow's school. Come on, man, what the fuck do you want to go to school for? What do you want to be? An astronaut? A dentist? A pay lawyer, nigga? Look, check it out: Why don't you just come down here after school and just work these rush hours for me. How about that: Hey. Hey. That's great. Thank you. I know that kind of money-- I said I know that kind of money doesn't come easy to anyone. No, it's just something on my end here-- some construction or something-- right. Yeah, right. Thanks again. Two hours, 30 grand. Am I getting the hang of this or what? What the fuck is that? DPW's tearing up the sidewalk right outside our door. You really pissed him off. Yes, I did, didn't l? Come on. Door-to-door in lrvington. - Right. - And we got that dead witness tonight. Yeah. Federal? Naw, she ain't no federal. That there a city girl. I like shorty too. She's all right... as long as she don't get in my way. Re-up right there. Por qué: School ain't starting till tomorrow, right? The little one'll be all dressed up with nowhere to go. Yeah, you know it too, don't you, girl? The camera-- if you go in front, they're gonna-- They're supposed to know it's me, man. I'm my own trademark. You feel me? Sí, but if they know it's you, then-- What, you scared on bein' made, huh? Claro que sí. How 'bout I put you in one of them full-body bunny suits? You'd be like a six-foot rabbit putting a pistol in their face. Let me get a pack of Juicy Fruit. You look like one of them half-soul, half-Chinese types from Vietnam and shit. Come again now, Mama-san. Patience, girl. More patience. The guy drives a shit box. He's got a two-bit minimart, but the back door in there is reinforced steel, and the security camera on the street is high-end. Not only that, but I think I made the re-up today: Schoolgirl with a heavy backpack. Hmm. Well, I pulled Andre's phone history trying to find Marlo's organization, cross-referencing DNRs to other cells. This is Fruit. This is Monk, and there's three or four other good probables. Not likely to find a direct line to Marlo that way. Andre had to go through Monk to get to him. No, but we might get a cell on Chris Partlow, or for tote or for one, of the top lieutenants. - We're gettin' close. - Uh-huh. Deputy pulled me downtown. You guys aren't into any shit, - are you? - No, sir. Good he wasn't down at the ocean today. And the subpoenas? You won't see a page of anything until after the primary. After that, if a document lands and there's no one there to read it, will the mayor and his people honestly give a shit? Other than that, what can I tell you except to get that unit back on the street where it belongs? Lieutenant, you are relieved from command of Major Crimes. You've done exceptional work, and in light of that, we want you to improve the performance of another vital aspect of our mission-- - Sir? - Telephone Reporting Unit. You report there tomorrow, 0800. Have I done something wrong? Lieutenant Marimow will be taking over Major Crimes. If you need to brief him, do so promptly. Yes, sir. Jimmy, how's that beach house coming? Beach... um, fine, sir-- Great. Sounds great. Yeah, hand me the colander, will you? He's early. You get the door. I'll do that. - Hey! - Hey! Come in. - Ooh, smells good. - Spaghetti-- nothing fancy. "Côtes du Rhône"? Yeah, the sommelier behind the plexi said it was dry. - Hey, Beadie! - Hey, Bunk, how you doing? Whoa, look at you! Blonde and all. - You like it? - I do, I do. Hey, kids. This is Jack, that's Cary. This is Detective Moreland. - Hi. - Hi! - Call me Bunk. - Let me open this wine. Yeah, that's right. Let that shit breathe. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - That's all right. They hear worse. - Yeah, no doubt. So, you want ice in yours? No, man, that's a double-digit vino. - Even has a cork. - Swell. - I like your binders. - Thanks! McNulty gave them to us. - McNulty? - Yeah. - Not Jimmy? - No. Uncle Jimmy? Jim? - No. - No: Daddy? Pops? McNulty. Oh, just plain McNulty. And if I take his weak-ass product, that means I'll be makin' less money, you know what I'm sayin'? Only reason I could bring any life to this strip is because of the good shit that y'all was givin' me. then I'm standing here like a asshole holding my Charles Dickens 'cause I ain't got no muscle, no backup. Shit, man. Yo, if this was the old days? Yeah, now, well, the thing about the old days, they the old days. People I'm working with now... So you want to bump with Marlo over real estate? You're on your own. But if you want my advice-- I don't, man. I don't. Bodie. Yo, Bodie. Me: I lost the wholesale to every crew in Winchester homes. Them horses takin' Marlo's shit now. He pushin' the independents over hilltop, too. I lost three crews there this month. What about the East Side? There we got a much bigger problem: all those ugly-ass bitches in Yankee hats chasin' all the locals away. I heard them New York boys ran off most of Delroy's people, and those that stay gotta take they package. Man, all this theorizing about how it be product, not territory? You can't talk that shit if a nigga snatchin' all of the territory an' won't take none of your product. See, the thing is Marlo's only takin' a little bite. Them New York cats is like Wal-Mart comin' to town. Me, personally, I think it's time Wal-Mart went home. If we gonna bump with 'em, it's got to be all of us. I tell you what: I'd like to see Marlo with us in on that one. You know what I mean? One big Baltimore team. Yeah, Marlo can make an inconvenient nigga disappear, can't he? I heard he got some kinda hookup at this funeral home in Westport. Coffin goes in there needs two pallbearers. Come out, you need eight to carry that bitch, you know what I mean? Nah nah. He usin' them shut-up rowhouses. Dump a body in there, no one can tell one smell from another. Well, whatever he doin', he cold, but he ain't stupid. Think it's time to try again to talk to the boy. I hope you got better shit to say than Stringer 'cause young'un ain't given no one an ear yet. Dang, Jimmy, you're a domesticated motherfucker. Yeah, I guess I am. Yeah, we're good. How's everything at the port? - Quiet. - It's quiet everywhere. - Even the Western. - Yeah. I'm having a hard time with it, though. Somethin' ain't right. Well, enjoy it while it lasts. - You working something? - Yeah, I got this one case. I know who the shooter is but can't find him. He'll turn up. - Maybe. - More? Oh, mercy. No, ma'am. Dessert: I was thinking we might go out for a little taste. Unless you got to tuck in the kids. - I don't know. - Oh, it's fine, Jimmy. You go. I'll tuck 'em in. She trusts you. Yeah. Can't go to dinner without catching a page, huh? What now? Her john jumps in the shower. She rummages his wallet. He figures it out and beats on her till the people next door call the front desk. Sir, if she doesn't have the money on her, I don't know what I can do. Did you beat that woman in there? I just want my money back. Excuse me, Mr. Gergen. I need a moment with my director of security. If she presses charges, I'm cuffin' that motherfucker. Mr. Colvin, this is a delicate matter. "Delicate"? Shit. Mr. Gergen represents a national consortium of convention planners, and he's been a friend of the hotel-- Mr. Colvin: Mr. Colvin: Now, you took his cash and he beat you good, huh? How much he beat you for? How much: Give me the cuffs. No, Mr. Colvin. I... What the fuck is this? She steals my money, and you're gonna lock me up? You're gettin' charged with assault. You wanna charge her with the theft, I'll put the cuffs on her, too. But you in a wagon, shitbird. Mr. Colvin, this is not acceptable. No. He's goin' in a wagon. Mr. Colvin, I have to insist. 30 years a police officer, I never took cuffs off a right charge. Ain't about to start now. You're not a police officer, Mr. Colvin. You work for us. Naw, I'm good. You nursin' that thing like a baby bird. You know those little corner joints in the ghetto that sell subs, and fried chicken, lake trout? Lake trout: Like egg creams in New York. No eggs, no cream. Exactly. No lake, no trout. They're pogies. Whitefish, trash fish. Exactly. White trash fish. I mean, "lake trout." That's all marketing. It's just all dressed up like something it ain't. You know what I'm sayin'? Sometimes it is what it is. It really is. That's deep. I like the way you think. Yeah, you too. Hold on. Dang, Bug, if you can tie one shoe, you can tie the other one. You hear me? Cookies all on your face. Come on. What up, shorty? Ready for the first day? Yeah, he can't wait to be in the third grade. Ain't that right, Bug? 'Sup? Dukie. Cool. Look at all these big-ass eighth graders out here. Look like some sixth-graders gonna get banked. Yo, come in here. I wanna show y'all somethin'. Go ahead, Bug. Yo, what up, boy? That jersey's crazy, son. Where you get that at? Yo, check it. This dude in the joint with my father drew these. I'm about to get one on my arm. Is this you? Why would you get yourself on your arm? In case you forget what you look like? Yo, what do these mean, man? A'ight, this one means "heart"-- Iike, you know, "He got heart"-- and that means "lion." How you know that? Word, the dude could be playing you. Like, this one, instead of "heart," it could mean like "bitch" or something. And like this one, it could mean like "pussy" or "clown." Come on, man. Fuck y'all motherfuckers. - They probably do, too. - Man, get outta my house. Understand something about me: I may be wearing these bars, but I worked the bricks to earn 'em, and I am stone-cold police first, last, and always. Froze my balls off in the winter, sweated 'em in the summer, ran, jumped, rolled in the dirt with the bad guys 24/7/365. Now, I'm a great admirer of this unit. Avon Barksdale? That was a 14-point buck you bagged. However, we are gonna do better. And if there's a case to be made out there, we'll make it together with good work and good supervision of that work. I want to be briefed every step of the way. Questions? No: Good. Yo, who you got? I got... "Prez"-- "Prez"-- what? I got Mrs. Scott. Fuckin' hate that foul bitch, man. Man, she ain't that bad. At least you ain't got Sampson. Yeah, I know. Yo, Michael, who you got? "Presborowski"? "Prez"-- Yo, he new and white. We got it made. Uh-oh, look at this. Where is your fine take-home car? Got took home. We need to talk. Sixth grade is on the first floor! Seventh grade is on the second. Eighth-grade homeroom is on the third floor! Don't go up the down staircase. Quickly and quietly, people. I see you, Quantell. I see you too. School's getting ready to start. Come on. Hi, dear. Good to see you back. Yo, what up, Turner. You back for more? Aw, damn, man. I love the first day, son. Everybody all friendly an' shit. Namond Brice. Already, we're starting? Damn, man. Next time, they stay in my drawer. Yo, whatever, man. I know, right? Already, son. I know, right? We're seventh graders. Yo, dang. You see Neesy? Yo, them bitches is on steroids, word. Word, son. Send them bitches to lran. That shit'd be over in a heartbeat. Okay, check the chart to see where you're sitting. Check the chart. Hi, I'm Randy. How are you doing, Randy? Check the chart. Okay. Good morning. Okay, good morning. Yo! Shut up! Good morning. I'm your homeroom teacher, obviously. My name is Mr. Pryzbylewski. But you can call me Mr. Pryzbylewski. Okay. Let's find out who you are. This is Mrs. Donnelly. Teachers, we had trouble with first bells, so expect the class change to ring in one minute. Students will walk, not run, to classes in an orderly manner. Okay, um, we'll, uh, get to know each other a little later. Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Latifah. Uh, sorry. Where my bus passes at? Crystal Judkins, you're not listed. Crystal? I look like Crystal to you? I'm Charlene. Ronald Parker: Ha. Karim Williams. Ronald over there. Aw Jeez. Yo, Mr. Prez, I need a hall pass for the bathroom. It's an emergency. Everyone, I need those bus passes back. Hold on. Whoa. Everyone, stay where you are. Stay where-- I need those passes back. It's an emergency. Mr. Prez... Everyone, I need those bus passes back. The kids that need them... - Mr. Prez... - What? Just take one. I need those bus passes back! No one leaves this room until Mr. Pryzbylewski gets those bus passes back. Do I need to say that twice? Thank you. Thank you. You'll get the hang of it. Come in. Are you coming in or what? I'm coming in, okay? You asked to see me, sir? I did. Seeing as how I like to know my boys in depth: why'd you want this unit? Honestly? I took the sergeant's test, scored pretty high, but not high enough. And Lieutenant Hoskins, we went through the academy together. He said that this-- this is a good detail for going up the ladder. I mean I know you have to do it for a while, but maybe next year, if I do good here, they'll reach down for me. Next year, huh? I mean, for some things, that's a long time to wait. Excuse me: I hear you're a good cop. I also hear you recognize who your friends are and that you're loyal to them. Did I hear all that right? Absolutely. Where are you on the list? 32. They took 15, but-- Thirt-- man, I thought you were gonna say something like 60, or, you know, 95. Hey, let me call my man Burrell. No need in wasting good police like you chauffeuring around politicians. I don't even know what to say, Mr. Mayor. This-- this is unexpected. Don't mention it. Today being the first day, let's have some fun. I'm gonna throw you a little math puzzle, see if I can get you thinking on your feet. Andre is leaving Baltimore... Uh, Mr. Prezbo, I need to change my seat 'cause this boy here smells like a garbage can. All right, you need to work a little on your compassion skills. Yeah, he needs to work a little on his soap and water skills. All right, like I was saying, uh, my friend Andre is leaving Baltimore. He's going 60 miles an hour-- Hey, what side of Baltimore, east or west? It doesn't make any difference. That's what you think. Okay, east. West, west, okay? Okay. Uh, and he's going, uh, to Philadelphia... Man, Philly's ass. Yo, you think Allen lverson is ass? - Okay, stop. - He only play for them. He ain't from there. Hey, I never play for the Sixers no matter how much they pay me. Nigga, they'd pay yo' ass to go away. Ha ha. Enough! Okay, Andre's leaving Baltimore, West Baltimore, traveling 60 miles per hour. He's going to Philadelphia which is 80 miles away. What kind of car? Hey, he drivin' on l-95, he need to watch out for the state police. They be profilin' niggas. He ain't say Andre was black, yo. C'mon, Randy. "Andre"? From the West Side? - Hey, he ain't say he was black. - Yo, you know he black. Okay. Okay. I said okay! Mr. Prezbo. You say he travelin' in a car. Is he driving? Or is he like in the back seat? All right, you know what? Fun is fun-- Hey. Take your seats! Everybody sit down! Hey. Everything okay in here? Why isn't Officer Massey present? Working overnight on the wire. Attendance at all office meetings is now mandatory. Inform her. And this Marlo Stanfield? This is the best we can do? - Sir? - This is the guy we're wasting months chasing with a wiretap? We could be on the street doing a dozen other different things. Stanfield is a comer. He's got a lot of West Side real estate. How many bodies on him? He fought a war against the Barksdales last year and dropped a few, but nothing recent. Nothing recent? He owns West Baltimore but with no bodies: Maybe it's just me, but in 18 years out there, I have never seen a carnivore eat a carrot. He's been quiet for a time-- "For a time"? This city's up to its hips in blood and you are sitting on one guy with a history? Okay, here's the new world order, guys. I want good, quick rips. Six, 10, 12 felony cases a month. That means no more long-ass wiretaps, no more subpoenas, no more mincing around on shit. We get out on the street and come back with stats. The Barksdale case is closed, and when the Stanfield wire comes up for another 30 days, we close out on that as well. Understood? You know, to hell with this. We got a wiretap up, and a judge decides when it comes down. Well, Detective, the Deputy Ops is gonna talk to you about that. Table B. Put those cards away. Kareem Myers. Sit down. Yo, yo, listen, listen. Kit Kats' $1, Snicker bar's $1, Warheads' $1, Twizzlers' $1. Man, Sour Patch 50c, and gum 50c. Anything you can get at the store, I can get in here for y'all. Gummy bears? Gummy bears? Ain't a problem. I got Snickers, M&Ms. Yo, check this price and come holla at me. Yo, I'm runnin' a three-for-two discount, and I'm taking personal orders for tomorrow... I'll be here tomorrow. ...so if you want something special, just come holla at me. There it is, yo. Why not give me a water pistol? Hey, yo, Renaldo, you just remember about how we gonna do. It'll play. Oye, Gordo. The package. Avanza, cabron! With that raggedy-ass piece? Nigga, is you crazy? Loco or something? Don't you know the shit is bulletproof? You don't understand-- You heard what the boy said. An' a box of Newports. Where my change, yo? Don't wild me. Hey, yo, you see the look on his mug? That's the reason why we get up every morning. Okay! Okay okay. Now, Andre's friend Yvonne is supposed to meet him in Philadelphia. Yeah. Andre gonna bone that skank. Can you please shut up? Mr. Prezbo is tryin' to teach us somethin'. You shut up, bitch. He ain't teachin' me nothin'. Yvonne, though, is coming from New York. So my question for you is-- A, who arrived in Philly first, Andre or Yvonne? And B, by how much time? And C... who gives a rat's ass? With this grant, the mandate is not only to rethink the way we utilize institutions, but to help us start getting past having to rely on jail and drug rehab as our only responses. We're looking for a specific target group to inoculate, epidemiologically speaking... Doctor, um, pardon me, I'm not an academic. Not by a long shot. But, what exactly are you-- are you saying here? He's sayin' he's got a lot of money to come up with some way to go at those boys out there bangin' on the corners. That's what I mean, yes. So where do I come in? Well, if the salary arrangements are suitable, your duties would be to perform as a field researcher, a liaison operating in the, uh, urban environment. You go out in the 'hood and get him some corner boys to mess with. See? This is why I need somebody like you to be paired up with me. I go out there on my own-- And they sell your tenured ass for parts. In so many words. Anyway, um, we're looking for 18- to 21-year-olds. This is where we see the demographic peak in violent behavior. You excuse us for a minute? What happens when you ain't around to translate? Don't play ignorant on me, Bunny. You can back-and-forth with any of these guys. I've seen you work. Besides, it's clear you ain't cut out for the private sector. 18 to 21? By that age, they're deep in the game. He's fucked on that. So show him. 50,000, 80-20 health plan and a take-home vehicle. I'd be amazed if they give you 30, an HMO and a bus pass. Peace. See you later. I go in there now, you know what that makes me? Some fucking asshole politician who's running for office. Watkins. 40th District. You call the reporters? All three channels and "The Sun." My condolences. I'm Thomas-- I know who you are. Thanks for your respects. I'm so sorry for your loss. We shouldn't be here today just because your son came forward as a witness. What do you mean? I know it's... I'm just sorry for your loss. That's all. A parent's worst nightmare. I don't know how anybody can go on after this. Yeah, me neither. Ms. Daniels. Councilman. How's things going over in the 11th District? Harder than I'd hoped for. Even on the mayor's ticket. Yeah. Eunetta's pretty well entrenched. Good luck with it, though. The council sure could use you. Councilman Carcetti, can you give us a minute? Councilman, over here. Councilman, do you mind doing a standup? Look, guys, I'm sorry, you know. Now's not the time. I don't really have anything to say. - I'm sorry. - What, is he kidding? What did we come out here for? You don't want the press coverage? Are you out of your mind? We'll get time on the 11 :00 from the visual alone. But I start making speeches right here? Now? How's that really gonna look? Boss, as political theater, this is pretty fucking lame. Yeah, well, you know, that depends on the audience. This is Shawn Williams. Lieutenant Mello, please call shift commander. Boss, you want me to stay? No. We're good. So, Shawn... You police. He ain't. Shawn, how old are you? 18. How old are you, you shinehead motherfucker? You have a sister, Shawn? What the fuck you want with my sister? And what the fuck's this Chuck E. Cheese-lookin' motherfucker writing? Let's say you hear that your sister was assaulted. Oh, who fucked with my sister? She wasn't. I'm just saying-- Sayin' what? Why you fuckin' with my head, motherfucker? And this bitch is writing again. It's a habit. Now, what would you do if you heard your sister got beat up by some guy? Which sister? I don't know. 'Cause it's Cherise, she probably had it coming. All right, another sister then. Danielle? I'd fuck that guy up. I'd fuck his ass shut. With you in jail. I'd get my boy to do it. What if you didn't have no boy? Then I'd get the nigga myself when I get out. Well, what if you had a life sentence? Then I'll fuckin' escape. And put that fuckin' pen down 'fore I shove it up your motherfuckin' ass. What if you couldn't escape, Shawn? Fuck you. Fuck you. Would you go to the police? Just a question. Son, thanks for being you. Thanks. Look, I'm ready to acknowledge that, um, 18-to-21 might be too seasoned. How you fixed for juveniles? Right now? Fresh out. The van to baby booking just left. But are you looking for kids in the system? Or just kids? 'Cause if it's just kids, you got Douglass right around the corner, and school's in this week. High school? That's what? 15 to 18, right? Yeah, but I would, uh-- I'd go younger even. Kima. 'Sup, girl: Are you sure? C'mon. I'm the one who took you out of the Eastern, sent you to the show. You can't come back here; you too good for a district. I need a home, major. If you need to make a move, move up or at least lateral. But a district is you going backwards. And you don't need to be under my wing, either. You're gonna be valued no matter where you land. Let me talk to people. I especially liked the timing for when you flew your paper. Shrewd. I couldn't see anybody shutting us down, not with the elections. What asshole would risk the headline? But to gut us from the inside out... Charlie Marimow. My Trojan horse. And now, let me guess, to save your wire, you're prepared to go to Judge Davis. If my memory serves, this isn't the first time a Deputy Ops felt the need to bury you. You have a gift for martyrdom.
