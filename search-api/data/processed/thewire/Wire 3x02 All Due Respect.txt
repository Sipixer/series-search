he's like, "young man, you know where the Poe House is?" I'm like, "Unc, you kiddin' me? Look around, take your pick. " So, the old man, he's like, "the Poe House. The Edward Allen Poe House... " shit, you back already? First of the month, yo... I'm like, "I don't know no Edward Allen Poe. " The man look at me all sad and shit like I let him down... I know you know you ain't comin' in here. What? Shorty, I don't know you. You know Miss Elaine in the back room, right? This her brother, Earl from the V.A. Hospital. He supposed to stay with her. Can you help me inside? I'm Chantal. So, what's good? Thank you, young man. Oh shit. Oh shit. Nah, nah, nah... Hey, yo, Omar. Yo, all due respect, but this right here, this a Barksdale joint, man. Do tell. All Due Respect You think this boy woke up yesterday morning, sat on the edge of his bed and said: "Today's my day to die?" You don't think this can happen to you? Doc, hold that up. Look at what that bullet did to his heart. That's his heart. What was that, scared straight? More like bored stiff. What's the deal with this? I go down to M.C.I. Jessup hoping to pull up a fella with some years on him, see if he's ready to share his feelings. Turns out Barksdale D'Angelo got himself rung up as a suicide. D.O.D. of 72103. Who worked it? State police. You want me to pull the postmortem on this? Yeah, he's kind of our made guy down there. I just want to make sure that nobody did the suicide to him. Ain't nuthin' but dust an' bricks over there now. Shit, all that battlin' we did to take them towers. You're tryin' to tell me we back on the street with the rest of 'em. Anyway, b, now that the towers is gone everybody knows how it gotta go down. I say we send our people over there early. Corner chiefs like: "Yo, we here now, "you know what I mean, but we bringing something to the table. " Lay it out like it's their lucky day. No flexin', no threats. Just be like, this a good thing. But you know we gonna need good corners, that's what we're gonna need. Close to downtown. Get the workaday trade. - Come out like Freemont - Fayette. Yeah, like 40, $50,000 a day, easy. Yeah, I'm on it. You know everyone watchin' us on this, man. They wanna see if we're gonna fuck this up now that the towers are down. You know what I'm sin'? They measurin' us up. They wanna see if we're gonna be weak or real. If a fool step to us, man, we gonna do what we gotta do. But it's them bodies that got you in here. If we can do this without the bodies, we should. You know what I mean? Especially now we light on muscle. Speakin' of muscle, man, you heard from that man I sent you? Yeah, Cutty from the cut. He rang, we took care of him. Good, good. How you fixed for the hearing? It's all good, man. Shit. Levy got everything straightened up tight for me, man. I'll be home before it get cold. Towers came down. So? So, we're comin' in. To my corners? I don't think so. Hold on now. This is gonna be good for you too... Yeah? Now, how you figure that? Yo, what you payin' now, 37, 38? Yo, we can go 31, 32 shots. Man, this shit's so John Blaze you can step on it seven, eight times and still take the cake... Spider bags! Spider bags! Damn! Yo, y'all seen Marlo? Y'all ain't seen him? Y'all know him? Marlo? Yeah, yeah, he was here. Now he ain't. Get those spider bags, spider bags!</i> Jesus, Tommy, I like to shit when I looked up and saw you on the news, givin' it to Erv. you fucker, you're up to something. I'm up to nothing, I'm telling you. I can help him, he can help me. A little itch here, a little scratch there. This is a win-win for you, ain't it? He won't play? You beat the shit outta him because crime is up. Press loves it and you score. Flip-side is that if he caves, you get yourself a snitch in the Mayor's inner-circle. So um... what's my role in your little drama? I thought you might broker a meeting. You know, help your fearless leader see the light about his new friend on the council. And I should tell him, what? Make nice or invest heavily in petroleum jelly? Hey, his ass, his choice. You didn't talk to him? I couldn't find the motherfucker. Man, we just walk up, we gonna bump. There. Middle of the block, right there. Yo, where the whistle at? Hold on. Wait for Marlo. Yo, Cheese. Where you been at, man?</i> Nigger, that ain't nothin' but bait. Just soap your bitch. Who my dawg? You my dawg. Who's my Dawg? Who's my baby? You make daddy some money, alright? Yeah. 25 large on Dawg. Cheese! Yeah. Anybody I want? Anybody. I want more than one. I want the Olsen twins. You got 'em. Slaves. All they live for is to get you off. But so now who you gonna do for 'em? One guy, one act, one time. Right. And the minute I name a guy you're gonna be like, "I knew you were a cocksucker "from the first time I laid eyes on you. Steve McQueen, huh? That's your fantasy? You fuckin' closet-case motherfucker. Steve McQueen? Fuck you, it's a set-up. Both Olsen twins. Ashley. - Kate. - Mary-Kate. And yeah, I admire their body of work. They're yours. All you gotta do is name a guy. I'm not catching, I'm pitching. No problem. Cornermen out of the pit. Release your dogs. I got that! Yeah! I got that! Break your dogs! Bait... Oh shit, there it is. Can it just be like... like this unbearable-looking woman? You know like that old tune from "The Golden Girls" the short one with the coke-bottle glasses... A guy. Hey, yo. Huh? Let me ask you a question. Where do you guys get those hats with the bills over the ears like that? I go into all the city stores and the only ones I can find are the ones with the bills in the front. Naw, it's the same. Just turn it sideways on your head. Thanks. Thank you. That's a knucklehead from the low-rises, right there. Terrace's spreading out. They got to go somewhere, I guess. Don't think you ought needed to do that. He turned cur on me, man... Nah. I think you got played. So, I'm guessin' from the Terrace being all cute about the property line. I just wanted to wait and see what you wanted us to do about it. </i> So, what you want us to do? Get back to work. Alright. Your boy really jammed me, that little prick. </i> It was all over the news. You did not look particularly commissioner-like. Mayor told me the same thing. You can't have that shit every week, not if you want His Honor to give you the job permanent. Tommy's a good kid, usually. An asspain when he wants something, but mostly good people. I don't give a shit what he is. Well, you can't have him pounding on you, Erv. Throw him a bone, he'll take care of you. Alright, but I draw the line at going behind the Mayor for this guy. You can't sit where I'm sitting and backdoor the fucking Mayor. Sorry I'm late, guys. My kid had a little league game. It started late. Well, I'll leave you boys to it. And what I have brought together, let no man tear asunder. - He win? - Who? Your kid, his team. Oh shit, who keeps score? Yeah, it's a little hectic, but everybody steppin' off at the right time. These corner boys we dealin' with? I don't think they even listen to their own people. Yeah, I'm gonna talk to peoples. - Where you at? - Marlo? I can't find 'im. And you told us not to start nothin', so I set-up in the middle of the block. You know, even that got hard stares. I don't know. It ain't gonna hold, I don't think. This Marlo. How hard you lookin' for him? Like, why ain't you out there looking for this motherfucker right now? 'Cause you called this meeting here. Shut the door. What's your good news, man. Omar right inside the stash. Couple ounces of raw already vialed, 600. Cocksuckers even took my watch. Second stash this month they did got to. I mean, he, um, he called you by name, String. I mean, all due respect, but do like unless you step to him. It's gonna be like this. Alright, man. Double the muscle on every stash we got. And if the man comin', make ready for the man. It's not personal. I swear to God, it's never personal with me. Truth is, I've been a councilman for almost three years now. And that's a long fucking time to be ignored. And this being Baltimore, a whiteboy doesn't stand much chance running citywide. Maybe the legislature, if the right seat opens up. But until then, I'm stuck in a job with no power except getting potholes filled. All due respect, Councilman, you're fucking with me because, what, you're bored? A little, yeah. And what the fuck. I mean, when it comes to the crime thing, this city can use all the fucking help it can get. If you're looking for dirt, there isn't any. There's always fucking dirt. But right now, I'm just looking to know how we could do better. You give me that much. I can try and get you what you need privately. No hearings, no press, no grandstanding. And if I don't play ball? You're gonna have my ass every time I'm in front of your committee, right? One thing comes to mind. Shoot. I can't get my marked units back from Dickman Street to save my life. Cars that are shopped for service don't come back for weeks. You tell the Mayor? Not that you heard it from me. Of course not. - How much these? - 10,000 a set. Nigger show that on a ride, he hangin' a sign on himself. Lock my ass up. No, shit. So how you gonna play it? If they from the Terrace, that's Avon. I know. And Avon, he comin' home, too. Well, if you inclined to work something out, that's one thing. If not? Avon can seriously handle up. I know. So if you want to hold onto what's yours, you best be ready. You remember that Barksdale kid? The one who took all the weight? Tied his neck to a doorknob in the prison library and sat his ass down. I dunno. Men of color usually don't do themselves. I mean, take me, for instance... Yeah, I mean. You got all the reason in the world... And yet here I am, still standing. Give or take. You looked at the scene photos? Nah, there ain't none. State police dogged it. My turn, Bunk. Come on, come on. Go with number three. You gonna play my song, darling? Huh? - You play the right song... - Hey, Bunk. I can make you hit the high notes, baby. Hey, Bunk. Hey, look, I saw her first, Jimmy... Bunk, man, what are you doing? I got a place right here in Canmden. Be a gentleman, come on. I'm bein' a gentleman, man. I'm really not interested, okay? Come on, let's go. You're all pink, baby. I'm really sorry, he's had a bit too much to drink, you know? It's okay, thank you, thanks. - You alright? - Yeah. You get yourself home? Yeah. Knock it out. Naw, the baddest nigger of all time? Who? This nigger from New York from the olden days, - Bumpy something... - Bumpy? Yo, he do shit like, run up to a police station by himsself. Nah. You know what I'm sayin'? Shit like that. Cops be like hidin', like, "Yo, Bumpy, we sorry, man, we sorry. Please go away, please, please!" Woof. And obtain gainful employment and refrain from associating with known criminals, and keep this office informed of your residence and any change in that residence. So I gather you're not working at this particular time. They still doin' the morning shape-ups down at the market? I don't know and I don't care. Just get a job, any job. - "Woof"? - "Woof", like a dog. Oh shit, it was like blaow! It was Cheese's boy, Tri. So you gonna hit back or what? You got a better shot of the ligature? Yeah, inside. What he do, hang himself twice? He could have been leaning straight forward until he blacked out then slid down which would give you the vertical. Or how about I come up at him from behind... and then set him down, make it look like goodbye cruel world. What do the scene shots show? None taken. The troopers really fucked the pooch on this one. All I have is some half-assed report reads like the investigator went off his ritalin. What's a large eckee... No, large ecchymotic area, or mid-back. Bruising. What, mid-back... as in...? Or he banged himself a few days earlier in the shower. Yeah, maybe. Nothing like a definite maybe. Tri finally got that m? Done it on foot too. Caroline? Nigger lyin' in chalk but my boy Tri got the dapple all up his sleeve. </i> Looks like polka dots. But that's just something you got to know from experience,</i> You know what I'm sayin'? I even had to school him on the whistle, still walkin' around with it. </i> "Yo Tri, stash that shit up at Neesey'S. What's wrong with you?"</i> Aw, you know them niggers is gonna get mad busy over this</i> so we gettin' busy too. So what time you comin' over?</i> Damn, bitch, ain't you even listenin'?</i> You still there? Time-out! Do that again. - Do what again? - Do that thing with your hand. Do it in my face. Fuck you talkin' about? Got a lot of room in here. Fuck the police! Naw, man, we was just hangin'. Just slingin'. How'd you work it out with the corner crews, all you guys from the Terrace coming in like this? I don't know what you talkin' about. Well, you best watch your ass. 'Cause the slingers out here? They're like the crack babies' babies. Man, every year everybody's like: "Yeah, these kids out here, they're a new breed. " "I ain't never seen nothing like this before. " "This the end of the world now. " Look around, fuckhead. This seem like the dawn of a new day to you? Can I go now? Or you want to slap me up some more first. Get the fuck out of here. How about a handjob? Huh? Aw, man, you don't even get Weezy Jefferson for a handjob. Come on. Dozerman. Wanna call it a day? They came back on us this time. </i> Dazz an' them. They got Peanut. </i> Oh, shit, is Peanut dead? Naw, he's okay. His brains all over the sidewalk but he's okay. </i> What the hell do you think?</i> Ah, shit, I gotta call Tony. I'll get back Atchya. </i> Alright. Well, that's two we heard about. What the hell's going on? Drug war maybe? S'up? Nothing good, man. I ain't sleep since I capped his ass. </i> Close my eyes, see him layin' there all bloody and shit. </i> Cheese, man, you did what you had to do. </i> What I thought I had to do. That's Cheese? He was my Dawg, yo. Had much love for me, even then. </i> I ain't never gonna find another Dawg like that... </i> well, they payin' for it now. Mos' def. For months, these assholes show perfect phone discipline. Now, they're talking up murders? Cheese is only a level below Proposition Joe. All of a sudden, this case has legs. Homicide... This is Freamon, major-case. Who's the O.I.C. tonight? Hold on for Norris. Yo, T., T., Man. S'up? I'm shot, I'm shot. Aw shit, shit, they comin' back. </i> Motherfucker! Who this? Damn. Detective Norris. Ed, this is Lester. I hear you're catchin' bodies on the east side. </i> You "hear" it? Like what, "probable cause," hear it? Like, "I got something concrete," hear it? Or just, "gas up my head," hear it? Like, "I got all the fucking time in the world to jaw with you," hear it?</i> How many bodies you got, Eddie? "How many you got, Eddie?" Asshole. - You want me to go up to homicide? - No, I got it, I got it. You're the early man on tomorrow, so go home. See your kid. I'm telling you, this kid Berman's a fucking wizard. I mean check it out, right? Six reported auto thefts, two of which state, "not impossible car was borrowed" making four auto thefts, with two unfounded. And the prizewinner? Four armed robberies, two of which complainants state, "too dark to I.D. weapon, not impossible knife wasn't a com.. " - He mighta groomed 'em to death. - Yeah... Wine into water. There he is. Abbadabba Berman. The Doctor Atkins of crime. Just doing what I'm told. God, what a beautiful film. I couldn't understand a word. Oh, honey, you gotta read the subtitles. Oh shit. Y'all go to the movies? And you must be the lovely Mrs. Herc. How'd you like your movie? Okay. Herc and Carver here? They try to snatch us up everyday like... where the shit, who got the shit... but they never get nothing. So y'all go to the movies. Damn. Alright then. See ya tomorrow. Is everything okay? On two. Pick up! Pick up! - Ed, you gotta help me. - I can't, now now. So. So? Everything good? How's that fontanette? Fontanelle. Is it closing up? Won't close for a while. Good. Good? I'm just, I'm just sayin'. Seis hombres, seis dolares. Seis hombres... I ain't sleep since I capped his ass. </i> Close my eyes an' see him layin' there all bloody and shit?</i> - Cheese. - Cheese on a platter. He never talks like that. Now, why would... because all good things come to those who wait. Does McNulty know? I'll raise his ass. We'll keep our ears to the wire keep gathering String, no problem. But if bodies keep falling in the Eastern District, we might have to give up this wire tap. Now you comin' around? Been more than a dam year. Looks just like his dad, huh? Let me ask you. When you heard Dee was a suicide, what'd you think? Hey, little fellow. Come here. Here's the thing: we got a tip. And the autopsy report it backs us up. Can you put him down please? Sure. You know, I'm sorry about your loss. He seemed like a pretty decent guy, all things considered. So when I found out about this, I felt like I owed him... the last thing I wanted to do was upset you if there was no point to it, so... if there's anything I can help with or any questions you need answered... or whatever. Major, how many people are under your command? 278, Sir. 278. And how many felony arrests they make last month? Don't bother. You made 16. 16. In a month. Same time period. How many handguns you pick up? All shifts, all sectors... once again, don't bother. The answer is none. None. You had four bodies last night in how many hours? Shut the fucking book, how many hours? Seven. Try five. Tell me about this kid. - I believe his name is James... - James Toney. When's the last time he was arrested? With who? Where's he sling? How about this guy? Or him? Or him? You know what? You got four bodies, all within two blocks of each other and you can't even start to connect the fucking dots. You got eight hours to get a grip on this mess or you're done. You hear me? Done. Marlo? You know I'm with Avon, right? Stringer Bell? Can we talk? I need you to walk back up there and pack up your people. I'm being a gentleman about it for the moment. You offer up what you have on this, you start the clock running on yourselves. The wiretap has to surface in court. No way around it. She's right. We finally got something worth listening to and you're talking about giving up the wire? Makes no sense. There's a war going on. We might have four more bodies tonight. This is Baltimore, we might have six. I watched Marvin Taylor from the Eastern get his asshole ripped today because he has no fucking clue. I don't believe this. We got top lieutenants talking about murders, and we can't figure out just to shut up and take notes? We got bodies on the ground, Jimmy. That's gotta matter for something. Look, if we're at Cheese then we're close to Prop Joe, and if we're close to Joe, then we're close to Stringer. That has to matter. Look, I was right there with you when we left Stringer on the street and it grinds me, too. But the fact is, we didn't create this unit just to lock up dope dealers. There's a narcotics unit downtown for that. We're about violence. Have been from the jump. Barksdale was violent. But right now, Stringer's quiet, and over on the eastside, we got bodies. Jimmy, we got enough from the tap to take a real good shot at Cheese. You put a murder case or two together, you may be able to roll someone up at Proposition Joe or Stringer. As far as bodies go, four's a big number. Okay then. As of now, we use the phones to work these murders. Yo quiero mucho menos pastillas de secoya en eso. Y muy mas ancho un poco. Si? Gracias. Yo, we bracin' up, son. Hanh? Gather yo'self, nigga. We gotta bead on Dazz. </i> Be at Neesey's crib in a hour. </i> Dazz be with neesey? I thought she was your girl. </i> Neesey, huh? Got it. We just hook up there, then goin' to battle. </i> Bring your whistle, in a hour, one. </i> Mount up. Caroline, call qrt with that 20 and stay on the wire. - We're on channel two. - Alright. Yo, Tri, what size fries you want? What? Go! Police! Freeze! Hands up! Put your hands up! Put your hands up! Hands on your head! Okay, Mary Tyler Moore. Buck-naked. Open the door, here I come, drop my attache case down, bend her over, give it to her on the ottoman, and she's like, "Oh Rob, oh Rob... " Who's Rob? From the show. Done. Mary-Kate and Ashley... I don't want to say. Just accept whatever pictures are on my mind right now. Anybody else? Yeah, Dozerman's girl, what's her name? She's baking a cake. Naked. White flour splotches all over her fine brown skin. I come in, in a chef's hat, nothing else on, johnson out to here and say, "that's no way to stir a batter. Here, let me try to get... " Hey, Doze, what's up? Done, now the guy. This is a hard one for anybody to understand. I mean it's got nothing to do with sex. It's about... sympathy. - It's about giving a guy a break. - Yeah, okay, okay. Gus Triandos. Who's Gus Triandos? A catcher with the Orioles back in the day. Me and my brother had his card, sorry lookin' motherfucker, man. I mean, he looked like this little kid who got left at a bus station by his parents. You know why? Because he had to catch Hoyt Wilhelm's knuckle ball. Five fucking years, the worst gig in baseball. It was like trying to catch a greased pig with wings. He even told a reporter once "Wilhelm nearly ruined me. " Gus Triandos. Big slow guy. - Good choice. - Go ahead, say it. - I know you want to say it. - Say what? There's nothing to say. - Nothing? - You put a lot of thought into it. It's cool. Okay. Okay. Tonight, three things. Number one. Keep your incident numbers sequential or it's gonna be a stone mess tomorrow. Number two. We'll be photographing evidence at the scene. That means don't bag anything until you get the shot off. And number three, don't embarrass yourselves... make sure your camera's loaded with film. Okay, mount up. So Cheese, who's your Dawg? You my Dawg. I just wanna know who's your Dawg, Dawg. What's this some psychology, huh? Yeah, okay, uh, "yo, please stop, stop. I'll tell you everything I know. " C'mon, Cheese. Who's your Dawg? Aw, hell no. You ain't layin' no bodies on me, man. Lawyer time. "He was my Dawg, man. " "I ain't sleep since I capped his ass. " "Lookin' up at me all bloody and shit?" "Had much love for me even then. " "I ain't never gonna find another... " Man, you all some cold-ass motherfuckers, man. We got you on tape. So what happen, Cheese? I thought he punked me, alright? So I did what I had to do. Which was... Lit him up. Well, he's talking anyway. Well, what's done is done. But, maybe we can help you on this. How? You gonna bring him back? No, on the consequences. Help us help you. - What? - Maybe we can trade up. Trade up for what, man? For this? - The fuck... - Proposition Joe. You give us Prop Joe and maybe we look at this whole thing with Dawg differently. Now, why would I be talkin' about Prop Joe behind... You know what, man? I don't even know no Prop Joe. Okay, Dawg... which one of these is he? Where's that body? Where I left it most likely. - Warehouse on the east side. - And he still there? Far's I know. 'Less the SPCA come around. What? Looks like they broke him. I got to say. You really showed me something on this. What can I possibly add to that except I owe you one, Cedric. You ever have one of those have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too days? I believe this could be my first. Tell me something good. We're charging him. Improper disposal of an animal. Discharging a firearm in city limits. Animal cruelty, if you wanna run wild with it. Go ahead. Call me a cocksucker. - You know you wanna. - Excuse me? You know, I actually looked up the stats on Gus Triandos. Power hitter, right? Fuck the both of you. Later, dawg. Kiss my ass. Night, Bunk. Funny day... I'm the new departmental pet for shutting down a drug war, but I blew my wire for a dead terrier. You remember how you said you hoped today would be your first have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too day? What about it? Okay, gents. You see the brake lights pump twice, you know we got a clean hand-to-hand. So I get in this morning and I'm looking at three phone messages from Buddy Ferraro over at D.P.W. All assuring me that I'll have 20 radio cars back in service at the end of the week. Buddy and my old man go way back. Made their first communion together at St. Leo's. So... what else do you need? You didn't go to the Mayor with it? Did you get your cars? Did anyone get fucked over it? Or did your job just get a little easier? I got 70 cops retiring at the end of the year. That I know of and no money for an academy class. The Mayor fucked you 'cause I know that money was in the budget. The Mayor delayed it till next summer. Less troops, less salary, less bennies. Even a six-month delay saves the city two, three million. Lemme talk to some people. Yeah. Major Colvin? Yeah. I'm sorry to call you this late, but we have an officer down in your district. </i> Which hospital? I, ah, just got the lease, so... Fucking solo cars! I shoulda teamed him. I fucked up. Dead-ass motherfucker's dead. We catch up to him, he don't come in alive. Right? Nicked jugular, shattered jaw. He'll live. Hand me one of those. I just got back from shock-trauma. You guys saved his ass getting him down as fast as you did. So what we got for a suspect? Number one male, white t-shirt. Baggy jeans, tennis shoes. In the wind, but we're locking it down out there. So what's this I hear about the gun? Doze tried to return fire, he dropped his piece. Some fuck picks it up and books. I mean I can't believe this shit. I'll take it. No, no, no... It'll be nicer when I fix the place up. Cedric... I don't care. No, tell him I'm cooked. I just got done at the hospital, I'm all in. Well, he was askin' if you could maybe talk to the reporters. </i> He doesn't want me talking to reporters right now. Alright. That would truly be unwise. Alright, alright, I'll tell him. </i> Alright. Bunny. You look hellacious. You got coffee going in there? You know what I was thinking? Tonight's a good night. Why? Because my shot cop didn't die. And it hit me... this is what makes a good night on my watch: Absence of a negative. That was a good night. Here's the thing. Six months from now? I'm gone. I put in my 30 and the only thing that'll be left of me on that job is an eight-by-eleven framed picture in the western hallway. But you know what? The shit out there, the city, is worse than when I first came on. So what does that say about me? About my life... Aw, c'mon, man. You're talking about drugs. That's a force of nature. That's sweeping leaves on a windy day whoever the hell you are. You fought the good fight... Not a call since we gave it up to Cheese. What did you expect? Attention. Be seated. Regarding officer Dozerman, His condition has been upgraded to guarded. 'Till he can receive visits, he's beemoved to the recovery unit. As of this tour, all hand-to-hand undercover buys of C.D.S. Are suspended in the Western District. Somewheres back in the dawn of time this district had itself a civic dilemma of epic proportions. The city council had just passed a law that forbid alcoholic consumption in public places. On the streets and on the corners. But the corner is, and it was and it always will be the poor man's lounge. It's where a man wants to be on a hot summer's night. It's cheaper than a bar, catch a nice breeze, watch the girls go by. But the law's the law and the western cops rollin' by, what were they gonna do? If they arrested every dude out there for tipping back a high life there'd be no other time for any other kind of police work. And if they looked the other way? They'd open themselves to all kinds of flaunting, all kinds of disrespect. Now, this is before my time when it happened but, somewheres back in the 50s or 60s, there was a small moment of goddamn genius by some nameless smokehound who comes out the cut-rate one day and on his way to the corner, he slips that just-bought pint of Elderberry into a paper bag. A great moment of civic compromise. That small wrinkled-ass paper bag allowed the corner boys to have their drink in peace and gave us permission to go and do police work. The kind of police work that's actually worth the effort, that's worth actually taking a bullet for. Dozerman, he got shot last night trying to buy... three vials. Three! There's never been a paper bag... for drugs. Until now. If we ain't doing hand-to-hands, then what the fuck? And that shit with the bag? What the fuck is that?
