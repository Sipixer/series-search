One of the perks of the industry. Not that I have to tell you. Oh, no, sir. Please. Understand you married one  of our stews a few years back. Yeah, she's    tired, now. Most of them do when they reach a certain age. The rest of them just keep   getting younger and younger. Like that pretty little trainee on your Miami route-- Tammy Matthews. Yeah, yeah, nice kid.What about her? Spilled hot coffee on you during your approach on Friday, is that right? There was a little turbulence,on the plane; no big deal. That's not all she spilled, Tom. Kid's been talking to some of the other girls about, uh, sharing playtime with you  and your wife. Yeah, well, that was all  off the clock. No, no, no, it's not the point. See, with all these women's libbers out there, a girl like Tammy could make serious trouble for us. this'll be your last week on the Miami route. Am I being fired? Of course not. Your flying record is flawless. In fact, when we announce service to Tokyo next week, I want you at the helm of that 747. You're being promoted. Congratulations. Oh, excuse me. Susan. Uh, I thought you'd  be shopping on the other side of town now. Janet. I've been calling and calling. ll, forgive me for not waiting by the phone. Janet, wait. I'm sorry about the other night.

This is so awkward... o you spend time with  is none of my business. Of course it is,  you're my best friend. Are we still on   for bridge tonight? Actually, we're not. Uh, Roger and I made other plans. If you'll excuse me, I have  a dier party to plan. ...biggest hypocrite  I know! u know what?

I'm leaving! -Stu...! -Go to hell! Wait! No! No! Don't you leave me! I'm sorry! All right, welcome back, everyone. I think you'll be very happy to hear today marks the official midway  point for our summer session. I, uh, hope you all found time to enjoy your existential freedom over our bicentennial. I know I spent mine enjoying your essays on Kierkegaard, and, as it seems more than one of you struggled to find appropriate literary comparisons to draw from, I thought I might offer you all a chance to pull some extra credit. In the back of your essays, you'll see a flyer. It's for a non-Equity production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting FoGodot. The director is a very good friend of mine. She has a very interesting feminist spin on the material-- so, if you write a brief, honest review, I will bump up that grade on your essays  by one letter. Raise your hand if you think   you might be able to come. Great. So...where should I put these? Oh, just on the counter here is fine. Okay. You know, I'm sorry out everything with Janet. Believe me, she hasn't always been this tightly wound. Most of the time she's funny  and thoughtful. I-I think she's just feeling a litt threatened right now. By me. By...change. Please tell me that Tom and I didn't scare you and Bruce off, too. No, no, of course not. You have to understand that that night is so... far beyond anything Bruce and I have ever done together. Well, then, I have an idea. Let's have you over for dinner tonight. Just your basic, casual evening with friends. I think you'll see  we're not so different after all. Hey, Mom. -Hi. -Hi This is my daughter Laurie. This is Mrs.Decker, our neighbor from   across the street. The post and beam? That's us. It's a great house. I love how all the glass frames the stone. Aryou interested in architecture? Laurie's interested in a lot of things. She's our resident overhiever. I see the resemblance. Nice meeting you. So...what do you say to dinner? No Quaaludes, I promise. You're back. Coming in? You bet I am. How was your morning? Inresting. Tell me yours first. How does four or five days in the Bahamas sound? Like a bribe. You said yes to Tokyo, didn't you? It tns out bringing young stewardesses home isn't the smartest move a captain can make, present company excluded. Well, I could have told you that. As aatter of fact, I think I did. You mad? Ask me from a Japanese pay phone, after we've been apart for three days. You'll still accept the charges, rit? So...how did you spend  your "interesting" morning? With Susan. Susan-and-Bruce Susan? They're coming over  for dinner tonight. Wow, that is interesting. Kind of thought they   were a one-time thing. Well, doesn't me we can't get to know them better. How far do we have to drag this crap? Not much further. I can't believe you wasted six months' allowance on camping gear for some crazy chick you barely know. It's her m who's crazy, not Samantha. Oh, right-- running away to live in the woods is totally rational. You know, I sure hope y're banging her. I thought I told you to come alone. Who's he? Rick.'s cool. Anyone else know you'reere? No. We can help you set up the tent. Just leave it. That's it? Not even a thank-you? Thanks. You n run home to your mom and dad now. Yeah, she doesn't seem crazy at all. New York desk likes our position on IBM, so stay in the money as long as possible. Carrie, what do you got? Here you go, Bill.

The new neighbors invited us over. Is that what you're wearing? Why? I don't know. Mrs.Decker seemed kind of stylish. I just wouldn't want you to feel frumpy. Where have you been all day, BJ? Hanging out with Rick. Your clothes are filthy. You have exactly 20 minutes to clean yourself up before dinner. Frumpy? Here you are, fellas. The, uh, the drinks are on me, gentlemen. Thank you so much. Thank you. All right, you know, I'd better call the wife and let her know I'm gonna be  a little late. And a little loaded. Does anybody got a dime? Here, I'll apply it against your bonus. Believe me, you  got one coming. Thanks, man. Hello. y, Laurie, it's Dad. I-Is Mom there? No, she left to pick you up. Uh, yeah, well, I'm, uh, I'm   still, uh... uh, downtown. Yeah, could you, uh,  could you write down a number and have them page me here when she gets back? Hey, Susan. Ror. You here for Bruce? I don't think   he was on the train. Are you sure? I didn't see him. Wow, you, uh... you look great. A little dressy, maybe, for a bridge game but...great. Janet canceled tonight. Said you'd made other plans. I didn't know that. -She didn't tell me that. -It's okay. S's been avoiding me  ever since... the party,and... I don't blame her. Roger, about the other night... No.No, no, no, it was fun. No, I had a good time. Really. And you know how Janet is. She'll, she'll come around. Looks like you were right abouBruce. Can I give you a lift home? Ah, I'm going to,I'm going to walk. It's the only real exercise I seem to be getting these days, so... And dinner's probably  already on the table. Don't want to be late for that. Bye, Roger. Hey, kiddo, what's for dinner? Something weird Mom's cooking. She around? In there. With them. Oh, Roger, finally. Uh, Roger, meet Paul and Martha Hincamp. They moved in to the Millers' old house today. This is my husband Roger. Most nights, he's a little more punctual. Welcome to the neighborhood. Can I talk to you r a minute? Excuse us. I thought tonight was supposed to be a night with Bruce and Susan. Well, if they can move on, so can we. I got you a new shirt, it's upstairs on the bed. Now, hurry up and chan.

Brad's a psyclogist. He's written three books on human sexuality. And how about you, Susan? Just a homemaker... and a mother. Culturally speaking, raising a family i the most snificant job there is. Ugh! Could you be more condescending? I meant it as a compliment. How-How many   women work at your firm, Sylvia? Not nearly enough.Why? Are you thinking about taking the bar any time soon? Oh, I think the time for law school has passed me by. Says who? Today's womacan do anything she puts her mind to. How about a toast? To the women in our lives. And to new friends. Cheers. Oh!

But he's not your dad. My dad went to Vietnam when I was five   and never came back. To me,At least not to us. How'd you get his wedding ring? Just came one year   in a Christmas card. It's a walkie-talkie. The other one's at my house, in case you need anything. Thanks. Uh, but I-I don't think the signal would reach. You can't stay out here    foreve you know. I-I'sure my mom has the cops    looking everywhere  for me by now. Actually, I don't even think    she knows you're missing. I'm pretty sure Rick and I are the only ones who know you're here. You need to go. Come back with me-- if things gebad, you can stay in my room as long as you want. Look, I can take  care of myself. Let me help you. Just go. What? You and me, here?

That's a good thing, right? And it's only gonna get better. It's incredible. What? You and Tom. That it actually works. You're really not jealous? Oh, it's only sex. It's not what really matters. Bruce and I made a pact. Notto do it again. The swging. Oh, good. You should both decide for yourselves what works and what doesn't, just as long as you're on the same page, and believe me, Tom and I   have a few pacts of our own. I am so happy I met you, Trina. Me, too. What happened to Brad and Sylvia? Oh, you just missed them. Sylvia has court in the morning Oh, that's too bad. We've all been invited  to a penthouse at the Hancock for a little after party. Oh, you know, we gotta home to the kids, but we'll take a taxi. Actually, you know, I think I'm ready to head back, too. It's been a long day. I'll go get Bruc You okay? Yeah, it's nice having  spontaneous nights like this. I don't want to lose that. Because of Tokyo. We'll make it work. It'll be really great. Oh, you think? Hey. You ready to go? Yeah. I'll go get my jacket. The only thing that can save these characters is the act of leaving, not just the desire to leave. But existentialists don't believe that life actually has an objective. True, but it still has value, and to achieve that value, a  person has to live, not just talk about it. Anane, this is Laurie Miller, the student I was telling you about. Uh, Anane directed the play. So, what'd you think of the productn? Brilliant. I loved that you turned a play about existential inertia into aeferendum on feminine stereotypes. I'm glad it spoke to you. So, how'd it all end? Wait-- let me guess. "Should we go? No, let's stay. "No, you stay. Okay, fine, I'll go." There's a bar around the corner that doesn't card. You guys want to check it out? I'm sorry. Can you excuse us? Yeah, yeah. Who was that guy? Mellow out, I'm  just joking around. But you're not funny. Why, because I don't care about that dbass play? No, because I   care about it, but you're too busy  embarrassing me to give a damn. Right, I almost forgot whatn idiot you think I am. Fine-- you're such a genius? Figure out your own way home. You need a    ride, Laurie? That'd be great. You mind if we make a detour to the North Shore? No problem. Well, you ladies wait here, and I'll "Godot" get the car. I'm headed up to bed. Sorry about the dish. Dinner was terrific, by the way. It was a disaster. Those people were a disaster. Dinner was great. One of the best you ever made. Really? Yeah. Hey, look... I guess I don't say it enough, how ch I appreciate everything u do to make things so perfect all the time. Thank you. So, why is it, no matter how hard I try, everything still seems  to be falling apart around me? Hey... Everything's not falling apart. I miss Susan. Then do something about it. I'm not sure I know what to do. Janet? at are you guys doing here? Uh, I.. We just...I just, um... Janet wanted to, uh, drop off a pie for you. At this hour? I don't know what    we were thinking. Obviously, I should have waited till morning. We, good night. Hey, fun night tonight. Yeah, thanks  for the ride. Yeah, I'll call you, Susan. Good night, everyone. Your pie is on the stoop. Janet, wait. Do you want to come in? I could make some decaf. No, thank you. Roger? Hello? Samantha, where are you? Home.
