Coraline is dead. You look just like someone i used to know. Ex-girlfriend, maybe? - Ex-Wife. She's found a cure. There is no cure for vampirism, mick. One of these days you're gonna have to stop hating what you are. What could be the downside? Missing all of the things that you once loved. Turn me. Turn me. If she is back, what does she want? She's back for mick. She's been lying to us, stalking us. No! She's not a vampire! She's human. She has a cure. The object missed her heart but punctured her left lung and partially tore the pericardium. Is she going to live? It's a deep wound, and infection has already set in. That's our biggest concern right now-- That and a buildup of fluid around the heart. You know, it's a very unusual wound. I understand she told the e.r.doctor that it was some sort of accident. Do either of you know what happened? No. We don't know what happened. Well, all we can do now is monitor her. I'll let you know if there's any change. Thank you very much. Why did she lie for me? Why didn't she tell them i did it? She wouldn't want the police involved. I can't believe i almost killed her. I-i thought for sure she was a vampire. You couldn't have known. I didn't even know. You still care for her, don't you? She was my wife. You really think there's some kind of cure? Coraline was a vampire for 500 years. Now she's as human as you are. Something changed her back, and if she dies, I'll never know what that was... Or how she did it. NEW YORK Did you find him? That's him. Where is he? He's living in los angeles using the name josef kostan. What do you want me to do? What i hired you to do-- kill him. I'll take the next flight out. It has to be done with fire. Fire's impractical. Long-range single shot to the head would-- . - no It has to be fire. Why fire? Because i said so. Burn him to death, and you'll get your money. Consider it done.

Tracking says women 18 to 34 find you a little hars it was poker night. I was supposed to be here. I'm so sorry. Yeah. Me, too. Who could have done this? I mean, they used fire. They must have known he was a vampire. Josef had enemies, but this... Who could hate him this much? - Yeah. You brought your camera guy? That's why you're here? You're on a story? Look, maureen sent me-- just-- beth, just go away. Listen, they were gonna send someone here to cover this story. Wouldn't you rather it was me? My friend just died. I dot really wanna talk to you right now. No, actually, you stay and get your story. You do your job. I'll do mine. Josef had cameras installed in every office? Top of the line-- offices, hallways, elevators, Parking structure, the basement, even the boiler room. He even wanted infrared cameras installed. I don't know why, but he insisted. I know why. Vampires don't give off body heat. Josef wanted to know exactly who his visitors were. Here. This is him. A heatignature. Josef's killer is a human. He must have come in with the maintenance crew for the night shift. As soon as i saw him go into mr. Kostan's office,  i headed up there, but it was too late. Wait. Stop.Stop right there. Can you zoom in on the incendiaries? Those look military grade. I need a copy of this footage. - Sure. Anything i can do to help get this guy. Yeah. Mr. St.john? - Yes. This is dr. Duffy.

Just a few minutes. She needs to rest. Okay. Thanks. Hey, coraline. U look like someone just died. Someone did. It's josef. God. I remember introducing you two. You thout he was a pompous jerk, and he thought you weren't cut out to be a vampire. We were both probably right. But you were best friends anyways. Ye, we were, and now he's gone. But i'm back. You have to tell me how. How i survived the fire thatou thought killed me? How you became human. It always comes back to this. You're so desperate to be mortal again... To experience death for yourself. Why? It's beth, isn't it? You think you love her. This is not about beth okay? I came back for you. I became human for you. Doesn't that mean anything? How, coraline? For you... You have to tell me how. Look, i know-- - Look, i'm really sor-- I overreacted. I shouldn't have brought a camera into josef's office. I'm so sorry. This is just really hard for me-- all of it. Coraline's in the hospital, josef's dead... I know he meant a lot to you. I've outlived so many of my human friends, you'd think i'd be used to losing people by now. Yeah, but losing josef's different. He survived 400 years. 400 years. He saw so ch, so much history. He was history. And now he's gone. And that loss to me... Is so enormous... That i'm not even sure if i know how to mourn him. I need a drink. Yeah, me, too. Well, are you just gonna stand there all day, Or are you gonna help me find out who killed me? Recognize that guy? No, never seen him before. Is he a vampire? No, he showed up as human on your infrareds. Does he know josef's a vampire? Well, he did use fire. The other people he killed-- your friends-- were they vampires, too? Well, remind me to donate a little something to charity in theiname. Oh, wait. I can't. I have no money. I have no office. I have no anything, because some janitor decided to whack me in a very public, Very-hard-to-explain how- i'm-still-alive kind of y, so everyone thinks i'm dead. Yeah, and it has to stay that way. This janitor of yours is a professional assassin with access to military-grade weaponry. Somebody hired him, and you're only gonna be safe so long as he thinks he succeeded. So find him and whack him so i can carry on with business. Ere are you going? Well, your assassin may be ex-military. I'm gonna see if your hack buddy rider england can get me into their files.

You... Stay. You do not leave this apartment. is this the ly time we get a clear look at his face? Uh, yeah. Is there a problem? No, i just-- when beth said she knew a hacker named sam, i thought-- You thought i was a guy-- Overweight, living in my parent's basement wearing a t-shirt with yoda on it? Yeah.

This can't be right. It's okay. I'm just checking your vitals. I'm dying. Calm down now. It's so strange. I'm nosupposed to. There you go. Nice and comfy. Stop right there. Mr. Kostan? Hi, tom. I can't believe it. Yeah, well, i thought about calling first, But i didn't want to make a big deal out of this. You're alive, but how? It's a long story. You're the only one who knows i'm still alive, and we need to keep this between us. Josef? I called you as soon as he showed. Figured there might be a little something extra in it for me. There is. You've already died once this week. Isn't that enough? Who are you working for? Answer me! Who hired you? Now... I don't like repeating myself. Whitley. Whitley? John whitley. He's a real estate guy in new york. You know that name? Whitley? I don't think so. Don't lie to me, josef. He certainly seemed to know you. Give me a hand lifting this guy, will ya? Josef! What's your connection to all this, mick? I'm investigating the death of josef kostan. You think this guy's the one that firebombed the building? I'm pretty sure. He looks like the same guy i saw in the surveillance tapes. What did he come back for? - I don't know. Security guy's dead. Maybe he was a loose end. We'll look into it. Good job. Listen, be careful with this guy. He's dangerous. Hey, we do this for a living. So i checked out that name you got. I found a john whitley in new york. He's 93, a wealthy real estate developer. At one point, he owned half the upper east side. That must be our guy. No family. His wife died two years ago. He had a daughter who disappeared in 1955. You think josef's after him? Josef's sense of justice is pretty much an eyeor an eye. Where are you going? New york. I have to stop josef before he does something stupid. I'm going with you. - Why? To stop you from doing something stupid. All******** josh. Oh, god. I-i completely forgot. It's movie night, isn't it? We need to talk. Come in. Are you... Are you going somewhere? Yes, to new york. You know, the, uh, the josef kostan story. I thought that was wrapped up. - No. So are you going alone? - No. You and mick, i bet, huh? When were you gonna tell me? I was gonna call you from the air... Airport. Look... This isn't working. It's just a case. - A case? A story.Whatever. Work.It's... Look me in the eye right now and tell me you don't have feelings for him. Look me in the eye... And tell me that. You ready? Oh, i'll--i can-- i'll come back. No. - No. I was just leaving. You two have fun in new york. If you need to stay-- no, it's okay.Let's go. How did you get in here? I work for you, remember? What are you doing? Josef kostan-- tell me about him. Is he dead? No, he's not. He walked aw from an explosion no one could possibly have survived. His friend dangled me off a balcony with only one arm. Now you're gonna tell me how any of this is possible, Or i'm gonna put an air bubble into your bloodstream and you're gonna stroke out without having gotten your revenge. He's aampire. That's not funny, old man. No, it's not. Now tell me everything about them. Tell me... How to kill them. Mr. Kostan, we've been expecting you. Yes, sir, i will. Sorry. Mr. Whitley isn't receiving visitors. Oh, please, can you ask him again? He was very clear. This is really important. - I'm sure it is. Now is there anything else i can do for you? Yes, can you tell him it's regarding josef kostan? No way. Hey, we asked nicely. They said no. After you. Mr. Whitley, there are people here. I'm not sure how they got in. Should i call the police? Mr. Whitley, we think you might be in danger. No, leave us. You hired a hit man to kill sef kostan. No... Sir, we have evidence-- I hired him to kill charles fitzgerald. Who? That was his name when he took my daughter from me... When he murdered her. Sara was 21 when that picture was taken. That was 1955. In a few months, she was gone. You ink josef is responsible for the death of your daughter? I ow what he is. He's a monster. He took my daughter from me. Well, you better tell me all about josef, so i can find him before he finds you. there... In that drawer. Bring me that diary. This was my sara. My wife kept it from me until she died two years ago. My daughter was a beautiful, innocent, trusting young woman. Her only mistake was falling in love with fitzgerald. He exploited her love. He seduced sara, and then he killed her. I couldn't protect her then... But i can avenge her now. So is that all in the diary? Read for yourself. So you hired someone to kill him. It took me two years to find fitzgerald. I can't die knowing that monster still walks this earth. You're gonna have to leave now. Thank you. Listen to this-- "it doesn't matter to me what he is.I love him." "i want to be with him, even though he tells me it's impossible." "i know our love can overcome any obstacle." "i want him to turn me into what he is." "he says it's dangerous, but i don't care." "i'm not afraid." "it's the ly way we can be together forever." "I'm ready." That was the last entry. So josef never mentioned any of this? Never told you about sara? - No. I knew he lived here in new york before he moved to los angeles. Vamps tend to move around. We can't stay in one spot for too long. You have. You stayed in l.a. I like the weather. Really? It's sam. Hey, what did you find out? Josef was picked up at the terminal by an h & g limo. I'll text you the drop-off address. Okay, thanks. 301 Waverly Place Can i help you? Yes, we're looking for josef kostan. No one by that name is here. Are you sure? A limo service just dropped him off at this address. I don't know what to tell you. What about charles fitzgerald? Do you know him? It's okay, paula. You can let 'em in. Well, you can run, but you can't hide, huh? Not from me... Charles. So we had a pretty interesting talk with john whitley. You wanna tell me what's going on? Mick, beth... This is sara...******** You can take your dinner break. I'll watch her. What's wrong with her? Uh, she's been in a coma... Since 1955. Oh, my god. She hasn't aged. You know, i met her at grand central station, and we were both waiting for a train. She asked me for a light, and the moment i looked into her eyes, i knew that she was somethin' special. I knew better than to get involved with a human. I knew it was a mistake, but i did it anyway. And for months, i thought i was keeping my secret from her, but then i discovered that she knew. She knew... And she didn't care. That was the happiest day of my life. So you were in love with her. I wasn't looking for it, believe me. The longer we were together, the more i began to think that The whole reason that i became a vampire was... You know, so i could live long enough to meet her. You know, it took me over 350 years to find her. And only a year to lose her... Forever. So what happened to her? He tried to turn her. Ye. And she'd been begging me to do it for months. I didn't want to, but she wouldn't let it go. You know, she knew that was the only way we could be together. So i tried. I drained her, and i... Fed her my blood, but it didn't work. She never came out of it. She got lost somewhe in between. Josef... This... L this... It's not your fault. I know, but it--it is. I'm the one who did this to her. You've been looking after her ever since. I couldn't let her go. Oh, maybe someday medicine or... A miracle or something will bring her back. Stay down, okay? Die, vampire. Why won't you die? It doesn't always work like that. Thanks. You're welcome. What are you using back there, barbecue tongs? Will you hold still? I'm trying to get the second bullet. You know, for a 400-year old vampire, you sure have a low threshold for pain. Well, giving is different than receiving. Done. How's your stake wound? Well, nothing a little blood wouldn't help. All these years, you ranting about how it could never work between us and humans. Well, what happened to sara is proof that i'm right. Josef kostan in love? That's proof that anything is possible. Love can show you a part of yourself you never knew existed. Or a part that you thought you lost forever. And then this happened. I guess the universe had a different plan for me. I guess who i am is who i'm supposed to be. You gonna try to make your thing with beth work? I hope the universe is on your side. Are you okay? I will be. That bastard staked me. Are you coming back to l.a. With us? I'm gonna stay here a few more days. You should have this. She really loved you. You all right? Yeah. I just can't stop thinking about sara. She was so in love with him. Yeah, it's terrible. Do you really think there's a cure? Coraline made herself human. Is that a cure? I don't know. I can't say. Taxi! Come on. Let's go do something. Like what? I don't know. Something fun. Something quintessentially new york. We'll catch a set at the village vanguard. We'll... A couple of martinis. A steak for the lady. Just you and me on the town. Come on. I don't know, but our flight leaves in a couple hours. So we'll take a later flight. Look, i-i don't know. I... I didn't leave things very well with josh. I do think i need to get home. Yeah, of course. But i'll drop you. No, it's okay. I'll walk. It's a good town for it.
