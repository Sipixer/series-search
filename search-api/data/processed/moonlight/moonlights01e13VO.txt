You Really Hate Being A Vampire, Don't You? Josh! Turn Him. He'll Live. That's Not Living, Beth. He's Human. This Is What Happens. One Of These Days, You're Gonna Have To Stop Hating The Way You Are. There Is Some Kind Of Cure. I Have To Find It. I've Waited To Feel Human For A Long Time... But I Forgot How Painful It Can Be. Are You Human? For Now, Yeah. How Does It Feel? It Feels Amazing. Shannon Noll's "Shine" * Get Up, Get Up, Get Up, Get Up * It's Been 55 Years Since I Slept In A Bed, Felt The Softness And Warmth Of Pillows And Blankets. * Today Is The Day * * You Hold The World * Do I Miss Sleeping In An Industrial Freezer? Would You? It's Been 6 Days, 8 Hours And 42 Minutes Since I Took The Cure That Turned Me From A Vampire Back Into A Human, And I'm Enjoying Every Moment. * Let Him Sing, Let Him Be Heard * I Get To Trade In My Usual Breakfast Of Blood For Fresh-Squeezed Orange Juice And Most Importantly... Coffee. Coffee's A Lot Better Than It Was Half A Century Ago, Or Maybe These Days, I Just Think Everything Is Better. * Watch You Shine * * Hey Now, Hey Now, Hey Now, Hey Now * Vampires Don't Eat Food. We Can't Taste It, And We Can't Digest It. Most People Would Be Worrying About Their Cholesterol Right Now Me? I'm Going For It. Sure, Nobody Knows What's In It, But I Used To Be A Vampire. You Think I Care? Carpe Diem, Right? Seize The Day... Especially When I've Spent So Long Sleeping Through Them. Today I Just Don't Feel Like I'm 85 Years Old... * This Is The Time * But I Am. I'm An 85-Year-Old Former Vampire. Sure, I'm Living On Borrowed Time, But I'm Not Dwelling On That Part. How Can I When There's So Much Living To Do? * This Is The Day * * That We've Been Waiting For * * All The World Will Stop To Watch You Shine * Hi. Quite A Spread. Well, I Realized I Have No Idea What You Like, So I Got A Bit Of Everything. Looks Great. You Look Great. So Do You. Mortality Suits You. Well, Thank You. I Forgot How Long It Takes To Heal Up, Though. Wow. Will They Scar? I Hadn't Actually Thought Of That. I Might Need To Find Myself A Good Plastic Surgeon. Lucky We Live In L.A., Right? It's Good To See You So Happy. It's Like A Whole New You. No. This Is The Old Me From When I Was Still Human. How Long Will It Last? Until You Turn Back? I Don't Know. Six Months, Maybe. Maybe Less. But I'm Making Every Day Count. I Don't Want To Have Any Regrets. I'm Really Glad You Called. I Wanted You To Know I Don't Blame You For Josh's Death. I Should Never Have Asked You To Turn Him Into A Vampire. He Wouldn't Have Wanted That. At The Funeral, You Were Wearing His Ring. Yes. Yes, I Was, But, Um, I Realized That Even If He Had Proposed To Me, I Wouldn't Have Been Able To Say Yes. Why Not? There's Someone Else... Has Been For A While... And I Care About Him A Lot. And, Uh... I Think It's Time He Figured Out What He's Gonna Do About It. I See Palm Springs, Mid-Century, Rat Pack... I've Been There. I've Done That. But We've Updated It To Fit The 21st Century. Think Clooney. No Think Kostan. Mick! Just Leave The Plans, Okay? I'll Get Back To You. Boy, No Matter How Much Money You Throw Into This, Remodeling's A Bitch. Are You--Are You Tan? Am I? I Don't Know. I Had Lunch At The Beach With Beth. Not Something You'll Be Doing Any Time Soon. Mm. And How Did That Go? You Seal The Deal Yet? It's Not That Simple. Well, Sure It Is. Boy Likes Girl, Girl Likes Boy. Didn't Your Dad Explain All Of This? Okay, And When I Turn Back? Well, Vampires And Humans Can Have Sex, Mick. This Isn't About Physiology. And It Isn't About Sex. Of Course It's About Sex. Everything's About Sex. I'm 58 Years Older Than Her, Okay? I Sleep In A Freezer. I Drink Blood I Buy From The Morgue, And I Have This Tendency To Bite Down When I-- Some Women Like That. You Keep Coming Up With All These Excuses. You're Not Afraid Beth's Gonna Get Hurt. You're Afraid You're Gonna Get Hurt. I... Am In Love With Her. Yeah. Yeah, You Are. Now Go Do Something About It Before It's Too Late. * That's When You Caught Me With Your Eyes * * You're Sending Shivers Down My Spine * * And Then You Whispered In My Ear * Hey, Maureen. What's Up? Where Have You Been? I've Been Trying To Get Ahold Of You. Oh, I Was-- I Was At The Beach. I Guess I Get Bad Reception There. Yeah, Well, Playtime's Over. I'm At "Buzzwire." Get Yourself Down Here. Now? C-Can It Wait Till The Morning? Oh, Come On. News Doesn't Care What Time It Is. I've Got A Hot Lead On A Story. Okay, Wait-- 20 Minutes, My Office. Okay, I Think I-- Maureen, If This Is Another Brangelina Alien Baby Thing, I Swear To-- Oh, My God. Maureen? No. Maureen! No! No! <I>No! Maureen? Help.

Thank You. Ms. Turner? Hi. Ben Talbot From The District Attorney's Office. It's A Pleasure. You're A Reporter Here, Right? Maureen Williams Was Your Editor? Yeah, She Wanted To Meet Me Here, Said She Had The Lead On A Story She Was Working On. Did She Say What Kind Of Story? No, But She Wouldn't Over The Phone. She Always Liked To Keep The Really Hot Stories Under Wraps Until She Had Enough To Go Online. Oh. Uh, Has Anyone Found Her Computer? No. Not Yet. She Never Went Anywhere Without It. I-If It's Not Here,I Think The Killer Took It. So You Really Think A Picture Of Britney Without Panties Is Worth Murdering For? This Isn't Just A Trashy Tabloid. No Offense, But, Yeah, It Kind Of Is. We Cover Serious News Stories Here, One Of Which Just Got Maureen Killed. Beth. Beth, What Happened? Maureen--She Was Murdered. And You Are? I'm Mick St. John. I'm A Private Investigator. Right. Yeah, Of Course. I've Heard A Lot About You. Good Things? No. Not Really. Excuse Me. Are You All Right? Not Really. You Ready? Yeah. Single Gunshot Wound To The Head, .38 Caliber. Powder Burns Around The Entry Wound. She Was Shot At Close Range. Maybe She Knew Her Killer. Doubt It.You Really Can't Smell It? Give Me A Hint. Starts With A "V." You Used To Be One? Maureen Was Killed By A Vampire? I Don't Know About That, But She Was Definitely Around One. Why Would A Vampire Use A Gun? To Make It Look Like A Human Crime. What? You're Creeping Me Out, Man. You Being Human, It's Unnatural. Well, Thanks. That's, Uh, That's Nice. Call 'Them Like I See 'Them. Whatever. Hey, What About That Gallon Of A-Positive I Got Stocked Up? Man, You're The Only One That Drinks That Stuff. Breaking And Entering Was Much More Fun When You Were A Vampire. It's A Shame You Can't Still Do That Sexy Vampire Jumping Thing. Yeah, Well, The Jumping Was Kind Of Tied With The Whole Bloodsucking Thing. The Killer May Have Maureen's Laptop, But She Was Obsessive About Backing Things Up. Trust Me, There's Gotta Be A U.S.B. Drive Stashed Here Somewhere. Okay, Well,We Don't Have A Lot Of Time. The Police Are Gonna Be Here Soon. Come On. Nothing In The Kitchen. We Gotta Narrow Down The Hiding Places. It's All About Psychology,All Right? People Hide Things In The Last Place They Think Anyone Else Is Gonna Look. Tampons. Excuse Me? I Always Hide My Nice Jewelry In A Box Of Tampons. Yeah, Okay. I'll Admit That's The Last Place I Would Look. Uh, If My Jewelry Goes Missing, I'll Know Who Took It. You Gotta Be Kidding. Okay. Travis. Oh, Hi. Hi. Hey. Hey, Don't Worry. We'll Find Someone To Look After You. God, First Josh, And Now Maureen. You Once Told Me That Everyone You Love Dies. I'm Beginning To Understand What That Feels Like. No, Not A Good Idea. Animals Are Naturally Afraid Of... Of Vampires. I Think He Likes You. Okay. It's All Password-Protected. I Can't Open The File. Don't Worry About It. I Know Somebody Who Can. * They Call Me Drlove * * Call Me Dr. Love * * Dr. Love * Just In Time For My Solo, Man! Is That All You Do? No. Tuesdays And Thursdays I Rule "World Of Warcraft." * They Call Me * * Dr. Love * * They Call Me Dr. Love * * Calling Dr. Love * Hey, Can You-- Can You Turn It Down? Oh. Yeah. Uh, Sorry. Oh. Didn't See You... Brought Company. Logan, This Is Beth. Beth, Logan. She Knows About Us. Oh, Cool. I Have Some Password-Protected Files. Well, Since You Brought Lunch... He's Not Lunch. We're Paying Cash Today. Your Call. These Files Aren't Just Password-Protected. They're Encrypted, And None Of My Standard Algorithm Programs Are Working. Amateurs With A Little Bit Of Know-How Are Usually The Trickiest. Did You Try Maureen's Birthday, Her Mother's Maiden Name... Yeah, And Her Phone Number, Driver's License Number, Social Security... For All We Know, She Used The Name Of Her Favorite Tv Show. Try Her Cat's Name. Try Travis. Nobody Really Uses... It Worked. We're In. We Shall Never Speak Of This Again. "Jill Button, Spokesmodel For The Donut Diet. Recently Found Dead Of A Heart Attack." Maureen Thought The Diet Could Be Responsible. Killer Doughnuts. Who Knew? Hey, There's Something On Kent Morrow. He's Running For Mayor. I Hear He's Gonna Win. Maureen Received An E-Mail From Luis Perez. He Claims Thathe Car Accident That Killed Kent's Wife Three Years Ago Wasn't An Accident. Political Scandal.That's The One. My Money's On Josef Kostan, Running Some Sort Of Charity Scam. Josef Kostan? Guillermo Said He Smelled Vampire On Maureen. Maybe It Was Josef. You Know Kostan? Yeah. Yeah, I Do. He's The Richest Vampire In Town. H-How Come You Never Introduced Us? Logan, You--You Never Leave Your Basement. Josef Didn't Kill Maureen. Like Josef's Not Capable Of Murder? Josef Probably Murders Every Day, But Maureen? That's Not His Style. Beth, One Of These Other People Killed Maureen. And I Am Not Gonna Let Them Get Away With It. Hey. Oh, Look. It's My Two Favorite Humans. Did You Know That My Editor Was Investigating Your Involvement In A Bogus Charity Scam? Nice To See You, Beth. Me? I'm Doing Great. Thanks. Except For All The Drywall Dust. It Getseverywhere. Beth's Editor, Maureen Williams, Was Killed A Few Hours Ago. I'm Sorry. Am I A Suspect? Cool. It's Like Role-Playing Without The Leather. Your Name Came Up In Connection With The Story That Maureen Was Working On. Well, Was Her Body Found In La Brea Tar Pits? No. That Was The Only Person I Killed This Week. Josef, This Is Serious. No. This Is Stupid. Yes, Maureen Called Me, And I'll Tell You What I Told Her. Look, I'm On The Board Of Dozens Of Charities. I Can't Keep Track. My P.R. Man Sets It All Up. I Had No Idea This Charity Was Bogus Until She Told Me. Okay. We'll Talk To Your P.R. Man. Remember The Tar Pits? Look, Here's My Schedule-- I Was Supposed To Meet Maureen Again This Tuesday And Give Her An Exclusive On A New Charity That Kostan Industries Is Setting Up To Help The Victims Of The Scam. I Even Got Oprah As The Honorary Chairwoman. Now Why Would I Go Through All That Trouble If I Could Just Kill Her? I Know It's Tempting To Always Blame The Vampire, But I Think This Time You Guys Are Gonna Have To Look For Your Killer Someplace Else. I Asked Logan To Track Down Maureen's Mysterious Tipster While Beth Checks Out The Donut Diet. Me? I'm Gonna Have A Chat With Kent Morrow, See What Spin He's Putting On His Wife's Death. Finally, This Is Not Just A Race For The Mayor's Office. This Is An Election About Hope, About Family. Politicians-- There's The Truth And Then There's What They Want You To Think Is The Truth. Figuring Out The Difference? That's The Tricky Part. Public Service Is My Life. It Gave Me A Reason For Living After The Tragic Death Of My Wife Three Years Ago Left Me To Raise My Daughter Bonnie... Alone. It Taught Me The Importance Of Family, The Pillar Upon Which We Will Build Our Shining City. Thank You. Thank You Very Much. Good Speech. Heard It Like A Million Times Before-- Always Sounds Exactly The Same. Well, Maybe He's Lip-Synching. Yeah, That Could Explain It. You Must Be Bonnie. You Must Be Lost. You Seem Too Cool To Be Hanging Out With These Losers. Well, Appearances Can Be Deceiving. Mr. Morrow. Mr. Morrow,Can I Have A Word With You? Uh, I'm Sorry. The Candidate Has A Very Tight Schedule. He Doesn't Have Time Right Now,Mister... St. John. Mick St. John. Where Are Your Credentials? Are You Press? No.I'm A Private Investigator. You're Going To Have To Leave. Did You Know That Maureen Williams From "Buzzwire" Was Looking Into Your Wife's Car Accident? Who Are You? Bonnie, Has This Man Been Bothering You? No. Do You Know A Man Named Luis Perez? No. I've Never Heard Of Him. Well, He Claims That Your Wife's Death Was Not An Accident. I Don't Know Where You're Getting Your Information, But You Are Way Out Of Line. Mr. Morrow's Campaign Is Built On Integrity And Honesty. I Have Nothing To Hide. Our Doughnuts Have Been Rigorously Tested. Every Ingredient Is Perfectly Safe. Yet Your Spokesmodel, Jill Button, Is Perfectly Dead. She Had A Heart Attack. Tragic, But It Had Nothing To Do With My Diet. Nothing At All. I Understand You're In Talks With A Major Conglomerate To Sell This Company. $50 Million Is A Lot Of Money. You're Implying... That They Might Not Be So Interested If They Found Out Your Doughnuts Are Killing People. This Interview's Over. Any More Questions, You Can Talk To My Lawyer. Take A Box Of Doughnuts On The Way Out. They Tell The Story. I Have Nothing To Hide. Huh. The Offer For Dee Dee's Company Is Legit. They Filed With The F.T.C. And The Board Of Directors. So Dee Dee Had 50 Million Good Reasons To Keep Maureen Quiet. Oh, I Checked Out The Doughnuts. They're Nothing Special. Mostly Fiber Bombs Sprinkled With Some Vitamins. No Bad Reactions, Though. Okay, So I Talked To Our Next Mayor. Doughnuts. It's Not Bad. How Long Since You've Had A Doughnut? 1952. Two Words--Krispy Kreme. I Spoke To Kent. I Didn't Have To Hear His Heartbeat To Tell He's Hiding Something. I Pulled Up The Police Accident Report. Kent's Wife Was Driving, And She Smashed Into An Oncoming Car. She And The Driver Of The Other Car Were Killed. Autopsy Come Up With Any Alcohol Or Drugs In The System? She Was Clean. Anything On Maureen's Tipster, Luis Perez? Uh, Guy's A Ghost? No Social Security Number, No Address Or Phone Number Listed... The Only Thing I Can Try To Do Is Trace The I.P. Address Of The Computer That Sent The E-Mails To Maureen, But It's Gonna Take A Little Time,O I'll Call You. I Got Guillermo To Pull Jill Button's Body For Us. I Thought He Was Mad At You. I Bought Up All The A-Positive He Couldn't Unload. Hey, You Can't Drink Blood Anymore. I Sent It To Josef-- Kind Of A, Uh, "Sorry You Were A Suspect" Present. Jill Button, Washed And Autopsied. Coroner Lists C.O.D. As A Heart Attack. What Are These? Looks Like Surgical Incisions. No, Those Are Liposuction Scars. What? I Have Friends. Could These Have Been A Factor In Her Death? Well, The Danger In Liposuction Is Internal Bleeding. Blood Usually Pools In The Back. See? No Lividity. So The Liposuction Didn't Kill Her. It's Weird The Coroner Didn't Mention The Incisions In The Autopsy Report. Every Scar, Birthmark, Even Moles Are Usually Noted. Logan Tracked Luis Perez To A Residence In Burbank. I'll Head There. You See What You Can Find Out About This Coroner's Report. Let's Go. Thanks, Man. No Problem. Thank You. Hey. Fancy Meeting You Here. What A Coincidence. Yeah. So What Brings You To The Morgue? Just Visiting A Friend. Oh, And Here I Thought You Were Investigating Maureen's Death And Circumventing Both The Police And The D.A.'S Office To Do It. We're Not Going Around You. My Office Got A Call From Kent Morrow Regarding A Certain P.I. That's Been Nosing Around. Then I Find Out The Same P.I. Put In A Request For Jill Button's Coroner's Report. Another Coincidence? Mick And I  Are Just Following Up On A Few Of Maureen's Active Stories. Ms. Turner, We Both Want The Same Thing-- Find Maureen's Killer. I Know That. I Also Know That You Have A Lot Of Cases To Worry About. The D.A.'S Office Is Overworked And Understaffed-- Okay, You Keep Doing This, And You're Gonna Taint Any Evidence You Do Uncover... And Maureen Was My Friend. Evidence I'm Still Gonna Have To Take To A Jury. Now Do You Really Want To Risk Finding Maureen's Killer, Only To Have Them Walk On A Technicality? * Here I Am * * While Fighting This War, I Stand * * While Wearing These Scars On My Hands * * Everything's Going As Planned * * 'Cause Everyone But Me Understands * Mr. Perez? I'm Actually Gonna Have To Chase This Guy? Crap. Hey! Hey! Hey! * I Can't Take It * * Anymore * Hey! * Be A Man, Go To War * * Throw Away Any Doubts * Hey! I Haven't Had To Run Like This For A Long Time. Hey! The First Few Minutes Were Fun, But Now... Let's Just Say Right Now I Do Feel Like I'm 85 Years Old. And I Really Am Gonna Have To Cut Back On The Hot Dogs. I Thought You Were I.N.S. Two Immigration Officers Came By This Morning Asking My Neighbors Questions. Somebody Tipped Them Off About Me. Yeah. Kent Morrow. He's Trying To Keep You Quiet. Why? I Mean, What's Your Connection To Kent Morrow? I Was The Valet That Night At The Restaurant Where The Morrows Ate. Okay, And... I Mean, You Brought The Car Around, You Gave The Keys To Mrs. Morrow... No. I Gave The Keys To Him... Her Husband. I-I Know That He Was Drunk, Okay? But He Was Angry. What Could I Do? Kent Morrow Was Driving That Night? Why Didn't You Tell The Police This? I-I Didn't Want To Get Involved, Okay? I Was Working Illegally. Why Are You Getting Involved Now? Why Contact "Buzzwire" Just As Morrow Is About To Be Elected Mayor? Who's "Buzzwire"? I Didn't Contact Anybody. Let Me See Your Computer. Logan. Luis Perez Says He Didn't Send The E-Mails To Maureen. Send Me Something From His Computer. Son Of A Bitch. The Configuration's All Wrong. Someone Rerouted The I.P. Address To Make It <I>Look Like The E-Mails Were Coming From Perez. Well, Who Sent The E-Mails? No One From This Office Would Be Talking To "Buzzwire." Well, The E-Mails Were Sent From A Computer In This Office-- Your Computer. Ellen? Dozens Of Staffers Use My Computer. What Is Going On, Kent? This Is Harassment, All Right? And I Will  Press Charges, Believe Me. Mick, Come Here. What's Talbot Doing Here? If Kent Is Maureen's Killer, There's Gonna Be A Political Firestorm. We're Gonna Need His Help. Will Perez Testify? He's Afraid Of Getting Deported. Well, Look, Either Way, It's Still His Word Against Kent's. There's Not A Judge In Town That's Gonna Go Anywhere Near This. I'll Be Right Back. No, Bonnie! Don't Come Near Me! Go Away! No, Bonnie! Bonnie, Stop. Stay Away From Me! You Don't Wanna Jump. You Don't Wanna Jump. You Gonna Give Me, The, Um, "There's So Much To Live For" Speech? You Have No Frickin' Idea. Well, Try Me. Come On. So You Can Talk Me Out Of It? No, But People Are Gonna Ask Why You Jumped, And I Wanna Be Able To Tell Them That You Made An Informed Decision, Okay? What, So Now You're Gonna Jump, Too? I'd Rather Not. I've Never Even Had A Krispy Kreme Doughnut. Are You Nuts? Yeah. No, You're Not. But You Know What Is? Living Every Day With A Secret That You Want To Tell Someone-- Anyone-- About, But You Can't. Listen To Me, Okay? Secrets--They're Like A Disease. And If We Don't Share Them, They Can Eat Us Up On The Inside Until There's Nothing Left, Until It Feels Like We're Already Dead. You Do Have A Secret, Don't You? Yeah, I Do. And It Ate Me Up, Until I Finally Told Somebody. Yeah? And Did It Turn Out Okay? You Know What? I Think It Did. Mick! Bonnie! Stay Back! Stay Back! Honey, It's Okay. I'm Here. Get Him Away. I Don't Want Him Here! Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey. Get Him Away! Hey, It's Just You And Me Up Here. It's Just You And Me Up Here. You Talk To Me, Okay? I Woke Up In--In The Back Of The Car... And Mommy Was Dead. Bonnie, Don't. We're Family, Honey! You're All I Got Left, Baby! You're All I Got Left! That's Because You Killed My Mother! It's Okay. It's Okay. He Was Driving, But He Said To Say That She Was, And He Said That-- That If I Didn't, That-- That He Would Go To Jail, A-And I Would Be All Alone. You Wanted People To Know The Truth, Right? I Just Wanted Someone Else To Know What Really Happened, To Tell The World The Truth About My Mother, Because I Was Too Chicken To. But I Screwed That Up, Too. It Was All Just For Nothing! Bonnie! No! Aah! Hey, It's Okay. You're Okay. Come On. It's All Right. How About We Finish This Back At My Office, Huh? My Daughter. My Daughter! If You Cared About Your Daughter, You Wouldn't Have Had Her Lie For You. Bonnie! Bonnie! It's Okay, Baby. Oh, God. Are You Okay? For A Second, I Thought You... Yeah, I Just Remembered I Don't Like Heights. If You'd Have Fallen, You'd Have Died. Yeah, But I Didn't. If You Had... I-I'm Not Used To Worrying About You Like This. Me Neither. It's Kind Of Exhilarating. Not Exactly The Word I'd Use. So What Now? If Kent Didn't Kill Maureen, Then That-- Well, I Guess We're Left With The Donut Queen. What Did The Coroner Say? Well, It Took Some Doing, But I Finally Got Him To Admit He Was Paid Off By Jill Button's Plastic Surgeon. What's His Surgeon's Name? Mm... Oh, Come On, Talbot. Quid Pro Quo. We Gave You Kent Morrow On A Silver Platter. Dr. Pierce Anders. He Already Has Two Complaints Filed Against Him-- Patients Hospitalized After Their Procedures For Unexpected Blood Loss. Well, Maybe He Figured Three Strikes And He's Out. What's The Address? No, You're Not Talking To Him Without Me. I'll Text You The Address And Meet You There In The Morning. He's Starting To Grow On Me. Hey. You Wanna Come Over To My Place For Dinner Tonight? I've, Uh, Figured Out How To Work The Oven. You're Gonna Cook Me Dinner? Yeah, I'm Gonna Try. Are You Asking Me Out On A Date? Well, Isn't That What Humans Do? I Consider Myself An Artist. My Clients Are My Canvas. Their Fantasies, My Inspiration. What Was Jill Button's Fantasy? Ms. Button Had Very Realistic Expectations. She Was Having Difficulty Maintaining Her Weight, So She Came To Me For Some Strategic Reshaping. Liposuction. I Removed 500 C.C.S Of Fat From Her Target Areas. No Post-Op Complications? None. Ms. Button Was Happy And Very Much Alive When She Left. And There Are Witnesses That Can Verify This? My Nurses And Office Staff Will Be Happy To Provide You With Statements. We'd Like To See Your Charts. I'm Sure You Understand That's An Impossibility. Doctor-Patient Confidentiality. Yeah, Well, Look, I Can Get A Warrant. You Have No Grounds For A Warrant. I Know A Judge Who Got A Bad Nose Job. She's Bitter. Beth, Get Up! Type A-O-Negative. Unusual. Tasty. Careful, Man. I'm Sorry. Most Of My Customers Don't Complain. Just Hurry Up. I Gotta Get Outta Here. I'm Doing The Best I Can Here. You Should Be In The Hospital. I Already Lost Two Hours When I Was Unconscious. Look, Seriously, Man,You're A Mess. No Wonder Anders Thought You Were Dead. Aah! Man. I Can't Believe I Didn't Know That Guy Was A Vampire. I Should've Sensed It The Minute He Walked In The Room. Aah! That's The Advantage Of Being A Human. Yeah, That And Getting My Ass Kicked. When I Was A Vampire, I Would've Wiped The Floor With This Guy. You Know, I Never Thought I'd Say This, Man, But Right Now Being Human Sucks. Look, Uh, I Made Some Phone Calls. Anders' Plastic Surgery Practice Is Just A Front For His Real Business-- Selling Blood To Vamps Looking For Rare Blood Types. So He Siphons A Few Pints Of Blood From Each Of His Human Patients, And Most Of Them Never Know? Oh, Man, That's Why He Took Beth. She Has A Rare Blood Type. I Don't Know Why He Took Talbot-- Maybe To Find Out What He Knows. Where Can I Find Anders Now? No Way, Man. This Vamp Is Seriously Badass, And He Won't Be Alone. Hey, The Address. Ben, You All Right? Yeah. Yeah. How Long Was I Out? An Hour, Maybe. You Probably Have A Concussion. I Don't Think I'll Be Calling For A Doctor. I Tried. It's Some Kind Of Surgical Tube. It Won't Budge. What Kind Of Psycho Is This Guy? Where The Hell Are We? Mick Will Find Us. He's Good. He's Really Good. Yeah, And Most Likely,Really Dead. Don't Say That.You Don't Know That. Oh, Beth, Come On. We Gotta Face The Facts. No One Knows Where We Are, And No One Is Coming To Save Us. We're On Our Own. What Are You Doing? Don't Do That! What, Use My Crafty Vampire Abilities To Sneak Up On You? Why Are You Here? Guillermo Called Me. Said You Were About To Do Something Extremely Stupid. I Said, "Wait. That Can't Be The Mick That I Know." You Should Come. You Love A Challenge. No, See, I'm A Lover. I'm Not A Fighter. Now Besides, I'd Just Get Dead Trying To Protect You, The Human Liability. I Can Take Care Of Myself. This Is How You're Gonna Fight Them? This Is How You Want It To End? Get Off Me. Get Off Me! I Hope I Made My Point. Yeah. You Did. What? You Were Right. I Can't Save Beth As A Human... But I Can Save Her As A Vampire. You Have To Turn Me Back. Whoa. You Hold On. This Is Not-- You Have To Turn Me Back Right Now. Mick, You're Human Again. After All You Went Through To Get The Cure, You're Gonna Give It Up This Easy? You Think This Is Easy For Me? This Is Not Easy, Okay? I Don't Have A Choice. What You're Asking Me To Do-- Listen To Me! All Right? He Has Beth. He Has My Beth. So Please, Please, Brother. Mick... Forgive Me. Ohh! Come On, Mick. Rise And Shine. What's Going On? You're A-- Oh, Yeah. It Is So On. Beth, You Okay? Whew! Very Dramatic. I Like It. Who's There? I'm Here. Mick. It's Okay. Oh, God. St. John? What's Going On? Ur Face. What Happened? Like They Say, Life Is Short. You Keep The Blindfold On Him. Hey, What The Hell Is Going On? We're Saving Your Ass. Talbot Took A Bunch Of Cops Around To Anders'. Place Was Immaculate. Yeah, Well, The Cleaner Is Very Good At What She Does. No One Will Ever Find Any Evidence Of What Happened There. He Had A Lot Of Questions. I Told Him I Was Unconscious Most Of The Time And I Don't Remember Much. He Should Just Be Happy He's Alive. He Doesn't Strike Me As Someone Who Likes Unanswered Questions. How Is Everything? Delicious. Good. I Was Worried About The Seasoning. I Don't Know What To Say About What You Did For Me, What You Gave Up. Part Of You Must Hate Me. I Could Never Hate You. But You're Back To Being A Vampire. I Don't Have Any Regrets, Okay? None? Yeah, This Isn't Exactly How I Pictured Our Date, Either. What Do You Mean? You Know What I Mean. I'm Human. You're A Vampire. We're Right Back Where We Started. I Just--I Don't Want You To Get Hurt. Maybe You're Afraid Of Getting Hurt. I Know What It's Like To Lose People You Love. But It's Part Of Life. Relationships Between Humans And Vampires-- Are Difficult, Dangerous And Complicated. I Know. You Told Me. If You Hadn't Been A Vampire, I'd Have Died Today. I'd Have Died 23 Years Ago. * Never Pay The Reaper... * Being A Vampire Isn't All You Are. It's Not What's Keeping Us Apart. It's Just You. * Except I Love You * * And I'd Give My Life For Yours * * I Know We Are * * We Are The Lucky Ones * * I Know We Are * * We Are The Lucky Ones * * I Know We Are * * We Are The Lucky Ones, Dear * Maybe You're Right.
