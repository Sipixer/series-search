No! Shs s not vampire. She's human. She has a cure. Something changed her back, and if she dies, I'll never know what that was or how she did it. I came back for you. You have to tell me how. Im an attorney in the DA s office Pat everyone down, starting with him. I saw the way you two looked at each other. What's going on with you two, anyway? You've been together for a year, and you're not even living together. Don't you think it's time to get serious? I didn't leave thing svery well with josh. I do think I need to get home. The rest of the city goes to sleep, and I've just woken up-- one of the many attributes that attach a vampire to a life of solitude. There are questions I ask myself that I just don't know how to answer. All these questions surround one uncertainty-- how does an immortal handle mortal feelings? See, right now we've got you pinned as a member of the H. E. M. Brotherhood and got enough on tape to convict you of both trafficking and money laundering. You wear a wire, I can ask for immunity. You refuse to cooperate, I file formal charges tomorrow. You do what you gotta do. You're looking at getting out sometime after your daughter's 35th birthday, Mr. Tejada. And you're looking at a miserable future if you come after me. This isn't el salvador-- my client has given his answer, gentlemen. Well, it went exactly as expected, and if I'm reading between the lines about my "miserable future, " I might need some protection. - You heard about what happened in la palma. - Yeah. He went after a prosecutor. No, not the prosecutor. It was the prosecutor's wife. That judge down there ended up declaring a mistrial. You know, I think you're doing the world a favor by moving forward with this. Listen, be careful. They play rough in el salvador. Your honor, in assessing flight risk, I ask that you consider Mr. Tejada is a well-known ranking member of the hermanos en muerte gang, commonly referred to as H. E. M. Which, as you're well aware of, your honor... Thought to be one of the most dangerous in the world... Known for ruthless violence in protecting an extremely well-organized trafficking and money laundering network... That extends to countries, if not continents. Mr. Tejada has refused to cooperate, which indicates he still has ties to this complex network of... Not good to accuse innocent men, ese. Remember that. So why did you take coraline's blood? Answers. I think it might be the key to the cure. You really hate being a vampire, don't you? Well, "hate" is a strong word, so, yeah, that works. It can't be all that bad to live forever. I mean, you'll see things when I'm gone-- when everyone's gone-- that we can't even imagine now. Like what? Cars that can fly, a diet soda that doesn't suck. Yeah, but it's not so fun to experience things alone. So take a vampire wife, then. Tried that one. Didn't work out so well. So are you gonna help me with this or not? Why don't you take that to guillermo and get a toxicology report? Not with this one. I have a friend, dr. Lin, at bio-nalysis. Okay. Good. I just think it's better we go outside the vampire nation with this. Yeah, why? Well, vampires like me might see this as a cure, but others might see it as a threat. Okay. Oh, my god. What happened? Are you okay? Do you mind if I talk to beth for a moment? Alone? Yeah, sure. No problem. I'll--I'm on my way out. I'll see you tomorrow at 10:00. Bio-nalysis, okay? What happened? I recused myself from the tejada case. But you--you're filing charges against him tomorrow. I was. What is going on? - You've been marked. - What? They'll come after you. -=www. Ydy. com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> -=www. Ydy. com/bbs=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> Moonlight Season01 Episode11</font> You can't recuse yourself from the trial. It gives out the message that the D. A. 'S intimidated. I know. If I recuse, it emboldens the bad guys. Noble idea. This is reality. Tejada mutilated a prosecutor's wife in el salvador. That kind of thing does not happen in the U. S. Tell that to the families of the three D. E. A. Agents he supposedly killed in el centro. But believe me, if it were me that were marked and not you, I'd never step down. Never. But it's not. You've spent two years of your life on this case. I know that, but I can't put you at risk. It means a lot that you would sacrifice this much for me. Look, if you recuse yourself and the case fails and then tejada goes on to kill someone else's brother or wife or daughter... You have to stay on this case. It's the right thing to do. I forgot how cute you are when you're crusading. I missed you so much. I can't help myself from entertaining the idea of telling beth how I feel. I know I haven't been here for you. You're here now. That's all that matters. I hope everything's okay. I've got caught up in my work. I love that about you. I wouldn't want you to be any different. Bobby. Yeah, thanks for getting back to me so fast. Listen, I want to set up a security detail A. S. A. P. Why don't you coordinate this with lieutenant carl davis? Hey, wait. If you're gonna do that, I don't want any academy cadets or chain-smoking detectives following me around, okay? Yeah. Yeah. What time is it? It's an hour after you were supposed to meet me at bio-nalysis. I'm so sorry. I completely lost track of time. It's okay. I dropped the sample off with dr. Lin. She said it's gonna be ready in 24 hours. No. No, no excuses, bobby. I'm serving an arrest warrant today, and I need the tac-squad to have a protection team in place by noon. Tac-squad? Somebody needs police protection. Yes. Me. Come in. To be honest, I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing, but she keeps insisting. Yeah, beth tends to do that. Yes, she does. But she's right. You shouldn't step down. I'd appreciate it if you'd keep an eye on her until the tac-squad gets in place. I won't let anything happen to her. I know you won'T. Just keep your eyes open. - Tejada's ruthless. - Okay. Thanks, mick. Ladies gentlemen your attention please its time to have father daughter dance in sweet 16 party plz warm welcome to mr tejadar and his daughter nichole thank you so much for my party, daddy. Nothing's too good for you, mija. I'm so proud of you, eh? For nichole happy sweet 16 Have fun, baby all right, let's go... You guys go to the right. Chemma tejada, I have a warrant for your arrest on felony drug trafficking charges. Daddy, what's going on? It's nothing. Don't worry, baby. Don't touch him! Get away from him! You shouldn't have made this personal. Don't you ever threaten her again. I won't forget this, amigo. What do you -- what do you mean, "nothing"? I mean, pharmaceutical drugs, trace botanicals, additional hormones-- there's nothing in there that's not supposed to be. What about unknown substances? Something you couldn't identify. Nothing. Not even caffeine. The sample was essentially untainted. I assume it came from a child? No. Why? That's surprising. As we get older, we tend to accumulate toxins. That blood is pure-- almost like new, and based on the levels of free radicals, I was positive that was a child's blood sample. No. Well, thanks, alison. Yeah, thank you. Uh, one more thing. I said there was nothing unusual in the toxicology. The blood type, however, is rare. How rare? Extremely rare. Less than one person per million has it. - Type- - a-o-negative. How did you know? That's my blood type. Furthermore, Mr. Tejada has refused to cooperate, which indicates he still has ties to hermanos en muerte-- these allegations are specious, your honor. The state has introduced no definitive evidence that my client is in any way associated with hermanos en muerte. He has never been charged with a felony or violent crime of any nature. Your honor, tejada has willfully flouted the rule of law in this country by intimidating the prosecution-- the state has provided no conclusive evidence that such intimidation occurred, and furthermore, if there was such intimidation, there is no evidence that links it to my client. Depose me right now, your honor. I am happy to, but I didn't want to delay the proceedings. There is ample reason to deny bail-- based on the conjecture of the state? What is not conjecture, your honor, is that Mr. Tejada owns and operates a local dry cleaning business. He has significant family in the area and is a highly respected individual in his community. He's willing to surrender his passport and post a surety bond. Your honor, he's a flight risk, a proven threat to the-- okay. I get it. Gentlemen, I'm gonna set bail at the amount of $5 million. - Thank you,your honor. - Thank you. He'll be home for dinner. Of all the girls coraline could have kidnapped 22 years ago, maybe there's a reason why she singled me out. Perhaps I have the same blood type. Maybe a-o-negative is connected to the cure. Well, I'm not sure about that, but for a vampire, the best possible blood to consume is fresh human blood from a child that matches the vampire's blood type. - So hang on a second. That m-- - wait. What? I hear something. Stay down. Let's get out of here. Go. You okay? You're--you're bleeding. You got hit. It's not my blood. Its coralines I came as soon as I heard. Are you okay? Why didn't you call? I-I wasn't badly hurt, and I knew you were still in a hearing, so... Are you okay? I'm fine. Yeah, we both are. Well, hopefully you'll be safe now. I brought the protection team with me. Beth, carl brought commander murphy and officers robinson and clayton to protect you, okay? Thanks for looking out for her. Sounds like it was a close call. Yeah, it was. Real close. This close, actually. I am so sorry, beth. It must have been terrifying. Yeah, it was. Supersonic vampire hearing can definitely help you... Thank god you're all right. I don't know what I'd do without you. I love you. But it can also hurt you. I love you, too. The D. A. Pinches me at my daughter's birthday party. He shows me no respect. In san salvador, the policía shows up like that, man... They'd be muerto. Mi hermana says it's only a party, but you only turn 16 once. I want you to bring that D. A. To me... And bring him alive, eh? Esta bien. Oh, god. - you scared me. - I'm sorry. There's nothing to worry about. The tac-squad's got you covered. I'm so sorry about the blood sample. Well, we may still have a chance. The most important thing is that you're safe. Josh! Josh! Beth! what is it? Beth, get back in the house. Call an ambulance! - get in. - Go,go. That wasn't the plan. I had no choice. You should call tejada. We have to keep them in sight. There. Look out. Damn it. - oh,my god. - It's okay. Turn right. come on lets get off the main road where did they go? Pull over. No. We need to find them. They could have gone three different ways. We don't want to drive in the wrong direction. We have to pinpoint their location and hope that josh has got his cell phone with him and that it's turned on. Beth, pull over. Okay. Okay, I'm calling him. Okay, it's ringing, but it's not going straight to voice mail, so it is turned on. That's good. You've reached josh's mailbox. Leave a message, and I'll call you back. Logan griffen speaking. Logan, mick st. John. I have an emergency. Yeah, well, I've got two fried hard drives. Life sucks. Logan, listen to me. All right, somebody has been kidnapped, okay? He has his cell phone on him, and it's got G. P. S. I need you to triangulate the location. Okay. Jeez, okay. What's the number? - uh,3-1-0... - 3-1-0... - 5-5-5... - 5-5-5... - 0-1-1-9. - 0-1-1-9. Uh, about 45 seconds, and I should have it. Come on, josh. Pick up. Did you hear that? Hear what? - Uh,30 seconds. - come on. Slow down, man. Slow down. Please, josh. Pick up. Josh! Josh, it's beth. We're coming to get you. Just hold on, okay? We're coming to get you, okay? Hold on. The phone is... It's not on a street. It's at griffith park, close to the observatory. Go, go, go, and make a right up here. They're in griffith park. Josh, we're coming. We're coming to get you, okay? Hold on. J-just get carl on the phone and tell him where we're going, okay? Carl, mick. They've taken him to griffith park. I-I don't know. Somewhere by the observatory. Wait. What's he doing? I don't know. Should we get outta here? Give it a minute. Now listen to me, beth. When we find them, we have to get up next to them, okay? And then we have to cut them off. - Okay,we have to pin them in. - Okay. And as soon as we do it, you have to get down and stay down. - Tell me you understand. - I understand. Okay, let's go. There, beth. There they are. Oh, my god. Josh! - You okay? - Beth. - You're okay. - here,buddy. You're okay. - oh,my god. - All right. Call 9-1-1. Beth, call 9-1-1 now. 9-1-1 operator. We need an ambulance. Somebody's been shot. We're in griffith park by the pond. Yeah, by the pond. Okay. Come here. Take your jacket off. Take it off. Take your jacket O. Now we have to apply pressure here. Put your hand here. Keep the pressure on, okay? We have to stop the bleeding in his abdomen, while I stabilize the other wounds, so keep that pressure on him. I was a medic back in world war ii. Multiple gunshot wounds were common. You did the best you could with what was available to you. It's okay, buddy. How is he? We need to get him to the hospital. No, we can't move him. No, we need to move him to the car now. He's bleeding to death, okay? I'm trying to stabilize the wounds. We got an ambulance on the way. You got one guy here. The other guy's in the car, okay? Stay with us. The artery in his neck is severed. I nene to make sure blood is getting to his brain. Give me your hand. Hold your hand right there. - Keep the pressure on,beth,okay? - Okay. Good work, buddy. You're doing fine. Stay with him, beth. I'm so sorry. Come on. All right. We gotta make sure the blood is getting to his brain. - Hold him still.Hold him still,beth. - Still. That's good. That's good. Okay. That's good. I've got this area mostly under control. Now keep pressure on that abdomen there. That's good. You're doing a great job. You're doing a great job, okay? beth? Tourniquet isn't working. I've got to stop the blood flow to his femoral artery. - Take your necklace off. - What? Just do it. How do you know what you're doing? You learn a lot in war. Just hold it. You find out why some people make it and others don'T. This is gonna hurt him. You hold him still. - Be brave,buddy. - Right. Be brave. If I can tie the necklace around josh's artery, I can stop the bleeding in his leg. You're okay. You're okay. What... what--what day is it? It's friday. Oct-october? No, sweetie, it's january. Our anniversary's in october. I know. You took me on our first date on the 17th, remember? You took me to your favorite dive bar, the rustic inn? Video golf. We stayed up till 2:00 in the morning. I've never had so much fun my whole life. I had to make sure you were my kind of girl. The artery's clamped. That should stop the blood flow to the legs. All this blood is taking its toll on beth. It's the sunlight that's taking its toll on me. How long on that ambulance? Uh, two, maybe three minutes. He won't last three. At the end of the day, not a lot separates life and death. He needs C. P. R. You're gonna have to breathe for him. - Do you know how to do that? - Yes. Okay. Breathe now. Two breaths. Come on. - That's what makes it precious. - Okay. And breathe. Come on, man! Don't leave me! Josh! I don't hear anything-- no pulse, no circulation, nothing. Stay with me. Stay with me, josh. You can save him. No. I can't do that. Yes, you can. Turn him. He'll live. That's not living, beth. Save him, please, for me. Please! He's human, beth, okay? This is what happens. His heart stopped 45 seconds ago. Excuse me. Ready to ventilate. Copy that. Ady y oentilate. No pulse. He's not breathing. I'm gonna do paddle check. - clear. - clear. Check for pulse. - No pulse. - Defib. I'm gonna check the pulse. No pulse. - Everybody clear. - Clear. Check for pulse. Pulse... no pulse. - Charging 360.Everybody clear? - Clear. I'm sorry. He's gone. Beth. Stay away from me. Bustos ain't talking. Huertos is in intensive care, and tejada's probably long gone. Give me five minutes alone with bustos. Come on, mick. I can't do that. Risk letting this guy walk on a technicality? He's not gonna walk. There's not gonna be a technicality. I won't touch him. You can watch from here. Just give me five minutes. Alone. All right. You got five minutes. This is a waste of time. I'm gonna ask you a question, and you probably should answer it. H. E. M. No canta. Get him away! Get him away! Get him away from me! Get him away! Tell me where to find tejada. El diablo! Get him away! El diablo! Get him away! Get him away! Where is Tejada whatever he's doing, it's working. Last time. Where is he? answer my question. He's at the-- he's at the hollenback bar... Near chatsworth. What happened? He's holed up at the compos bar in boyle heights. Compos bar Boyle heights? Good work. I hated lying to carl like that, but tejada had eluded the legal system enough, and I had a score to settle. Tejada made this personal. When it comes to revenge and vampires, blood is vengeance. Where's tejada? No s? And then there's the part in every bar scene where the bartender pulls out shotgun. Right on cue. You missed me. I see them staring at me like I'm inhuman. Those looks used to bother me. Not now. Where's tejada? In his office tejada. What? You come to my place. You come to my place and spill blood. Big mistake, 'cause now I'll have your blood. Gonna answer that? I don't wanna talk to anyone. Please, could you just leave? Just give me a minute. I know you're angry that I didn't turn josh, but I didn't kill him. Huerta killed him. Tejada killed him. Beth... His job killed him. You can't blame me for him being gone. Turning someone into a vampire isn't saving a life. It's taking one. Because it's such a curse. I know. You tell me all the time. You don't know. Beth, how could you know? If you hate what you are so much, then why do you go on living? You make me want to. I'm not really sure. I'm not really sure. I did a lot of bad things after I was turned, beth-- things that you could never imagine, things I carry tremendous amounts of guilt about. I wanna make up for them. Beth? I just can't stop thinking about him. If--if you'd have done it, he'd still be here. What if it were me lying there instead of josh, seconds before death? Would you have saved me? Would you have saved me? I would have done the same thing. She asked me something I've asked myself over and over again. The truth is, I don't know what I would do. What I do know is, at the end of the day, not a lot separates life and death-- only one thing... Eternity. -=www. Ydy.
