and might make up for what I am.</i> Whatever you've heard about vampires,</i> you don't know the whole story.</i> I have boundaries, rules. My friend Josef has a different philosophy.</i> I know you have morals and scruples, and that's fine... 22 years ago, I took a case that changed my life forever.</i> Please help me. Someone took my daughter. Everything's gonna be all right. You're not gonna do this. Over the years, I tried to stay close,</i> in case she needed me... This is Beth Turner for "Buzzwire. " Though she can never know what I am.</i> What do you like better? "Vampire slaying rocks L.A."... There's no such thing as vampires. Holding her in my arms, it almost feels</i> like it could work between us,</i> but monsters don't get "happily ever after. "</i> Well, he's finally getting out, isn't he? Yes, a lot of us have worked a long time for this moment. I'm talking to my good friend Julia Stephens, newspaper reporter and author of the upcoming book "Wronged Man. " It's about Lee Jay Spalding, a man who spent 25 years in prison. For a crime he didn't commit. - And he's just won his parole, is that right? - Yes, thank god.</i> - Talk about dedication... - Have you seen this?</i> - You not only chronicled... - They're letting him out.</i> Yeah, I knew you'd be on the warpath, so I brought you some fresh blood. Never underestimate the stupidity of what humans will do. Hey, cut 'em some slack. I believe you used to be one before you became a vampire. You seem pretty convinced by this guy. I mean, he was...</i> Oh, is that your friend- The blonde? I'd like to meet her someday. What? I'm just saying. During the last two years researching this book,</i> I really got to know Lee Jay.</i> He is an amazing individual...</i> Really a lesson to us all. Think of it-25 years, and he holds absolutely no grudge</i> against the man who wrongly convicted him.</i> Please. I should get her to write a book about me... Make me sound all innocent and suffering. - She's involved with him. - Oh, you think? Look, humans don't know how to properly deal with their bad guys. I mean, what else is new? And you want to take matters into your own hands. Now come on. I got a few hours to kill. Look, otherwise, just let the guilt go, okay? Now what this guy Lee Jay did- That wasn't your fault. Yes, it was. You weren't there. A woman's dead because of me. I'm sorry to bust up your evening, Mick, but your card was in the dead girl's pocket. You know her? Yeah, she was my client. She hired me to protect her. Looks like suicide- Gun in hand, shot through mouth. This isn't suicide. This is murder. Yeah? I know who did this. You want to share with the rest of us? When I finally caught up with Lee Jay...</i> I was gonna kill him. No question. He was a dead man. But I messed up. You killed her. You made it look like suicide. Who are you? Oh, my God! What are you? This cop comes out of nowhere...</i> And I... I didn't get to finish the job. Lee Jay knows what I am. Wow. You really did mess up. Well, you absolutely better waste this guy. It's not that simple. Yeah, it is. Now what if he decides to go all Van Helsing and come after you? So... Welcome back, bro. How you doing, bro? Good, man. Good to see you. - How you feeling, man? - Pretty good. Looks like you got a lot of readin' done. Oh, not reading- Research. We're goin' huntin'. 1 x 02: Out of the Past Don't you hurt her. Mick... I think you're having a bad dream. I'll say. You were talking, muttering something. What did I say? "Mick. " I'm sorry. He was in the dream. You almost died last week. He saved you. I understand. I was dreaming about what happened when I was little, when I was taken. I was in the room with a scary woman, only this time Mick was there. Well, that's your subconscious trying to process everything, You know? Think you should talk to someone about it? I think... I should go to work. Do you know where I could find Beth Turner? Right over there. Great, thanks. All right, man. Oh, look who's slummin' again. Ah, thought you might want to be reminded what a real reporter looks like. Please. By the time you put out your little early edition, we've covered overnight plus video follow-ups, okay? Please. People want news, they read the paper. They want to find out what latest celebrity train wreck passed out in their own vomit, they read you. 2 million visitors so far today and counting. Oh, boy. Here. For you. It's not even in the stores yet. I finally get to read it. Yes, and here is an invitation to the release party. - Steve and I are on it. - Can't wait. We'll get plenty of B-roll, make sure we capture the whole vibe. Oh, I really appreciate you doing this for me. Oh, forget it. You're helping me. Lee Jay is a great human interest story. I can't wait for you to meet him. He's so not what you would expect. He became a sculptor when he was in prison, Got involved with a program to bring at-risk kids to art. There's one thing I didn't quite understand yesterday. Why were the cops so convinced that Lee Jay was guilty of Eileen's murder? He had some priors. He was an easy mark, even with the contaminated evidence. The police contaminated the evidence? It was a P.I., actually. He almost beat Lee Jay to death. Mick St. John. Mick St. John? Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. I wrote the book. Here. Oh, my gosh. Do you know him? He never returned my calls. Yeah, I mean, the Mick St. John I know is, like, 30. This happened 25 years ago. This can't be the same guy. Do you have any idea how hard it is to come up with a gift that says, "Thanks for saving me from a psycho serial killer"? Miss Manners doesn't cover that? Surprisingly, no. So... 25-year-old. Thank you. I thought you might want to see this. A friend of mine wrote it. There was a P. I. involved in this case called Mick St. John. Really? So? That picture was from 1950, back before I became a vampire,</i> when film could still capture my image.</i> That's my father. Looks more like your twin. I inherited some strong genes. The book says your father had a serious run-in with Lee Jay. Did he ever tell you about that? Kind of. He told me Lee Jay was one of those broken individuals who can't stop themselves, that they have to kill. So you might want to tell your friend she's got it all wrong. She's a really good reporter. - She researched this very carefully. - Tell her she got it wrong. Okay. And tell her to be careful. I guess I should go. Hey, Lee Jay. Good to be free again, huh? Yeah, 25 years late, but good to be out. Now we got that stuff you wanted. Good. Wood stakes. We going camping? Yeah, somethin' like that. It's good to see you, Bobby. I had a feeling you'd drop by after they paroled Lee Jay. Yeah, I know. I should have kept in touch. But you're here now, and get a load of this. Detective Desmond, Lee Jay Spalding.</i> You arrested me, helped put me behind bars.</i> I saw you at all my parole hearings,</i> always telling the board not to set me free.</i> Well, I want you to know that I, uh, I forgive you.</i> It's all behind me now. Well, when I want forgiveness, I won't be applying to Lee Jay Spalding. It's my fault that he's out. - It's the book's fault. - He'll kill again, Bobby. As soon as he finds a woman to play. I think he may have already- The author. Well, that's gonna be some honeymoon. You still got that case file? The first wife? Oh, yeah. That other so-called suicide? I got it out for you. You know, he wouldn't be getting out if we'd been able to admit that as evidence. I know. So what are you planning now? I've got a friend. She's a reporter. She doesn't know the real story of Lee Jay, only what happened in the book. Don't you go doing nothing stupid. We're senior citizens now. Don't want to break a hip. You be careful, too, okay? And you make sure you call me if Lee Jay contacts you again. God, Mick, it's good to hear your voice. Same as ever. Hey, what's with these muscles? How you staying so fit? Oh, you know, diet. Give me some of that. Take care. You take care, Bobby. You take care. When you live forever, it's disappointing how little humans change.</i> Technology, though- It always gets better.</i> If I hadn't become a vampire, I would have missed out on the Internet,</i> Tivo, "World of Warcraft"... and G.P.S. Get some stuff of Lee Jay and Julia. - Don't get in their faces... - But get their faces. Roger that. What are you doing here? I wanted to talk to you... Apologize. That's fine. You're entitled to your opinion. It's a free country, right? Right. I brought you something. It's the case file from Lee Jay's arrest. You need to read that. You really think this is the right place? Open it, please. You need to know the truth. I'm kind of busy right now. Beth, there you are. I want you to meet Lee Jay. Oh, my god. Uh, this is Mick St. John. You knew... my father. Yes. I tried to contact him to interview him for my book. - He passed away. - I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks. Well, uh, Lee Jay, it's time. You're on. Catch you later, Mick. Yeah, you will. Ladies and gentlemen, please wellcome Lee Jay Spalding. Ladies and gentlemen, the man of the hour, Lee Jay Spalding. I can't tell you how great it is to be out, and I really appreciate everything all of you have done for me. I see all these wonderful young faces here tonight, and I've worked with some of you, and others I'm meeting tonight, I have a message for you, because once, I was you. Don't ever let anybody hold you back. I don't care who they are or how tough they think they are. You look them straight in the eye, and you say, "I'm better than you. "I'm stronger than you, "and I'm going to win. " Thank you. The scary one. You might have all these people fooled, but I know what you are. Oh, what am I? You're not gonna get away with it this time. Oh, I know, I know. They say they've gotten tough on crime. They always say that. No. I meant, you're not gonna be hurting any more women. I won't let you. You know, it's funny, Because I know what you are... Vampire. You've probably killed more people than I have, haven't you? Now if I got this right, a stake in your heart will paralyze you. I could put you in an art display for the whole world to see, maybe put you in one of my new sculptures. Oh, Mick. Aah! Back off! You stay away from me! You stay away from me! - Lee Jay, what happened? - Oh, that man's crazy. - You all right? - That man's crazy. Somebody help! Please, somebody help. Lee Jay. Lee Jay, what- What happened? Oh, my god. We have to get you to a hospital. Please, I don't want any more trouble. Um, okay, your friend? Not so good at parties. Lee Jay, we should call the police. No, don't call the police. I don't want to press charges. All right, he's obviously disturbed, but jail is not what he needs. Very nice. Is that your party personality? I didn't do anything. I'd hate to see what you call "something. " - I didn't touch him. - Yeah, right. He did that to himself. That's ridiculous. The pain and blood is worth setting me up. It's just the way he thinks. Did you read the case file? You know, with all the excitement, I haven't had a chance yet. This guy killed two women, Beth, and he pawned them both off as suicides. That guy romancing your friend... He's a killer. Trust me. Eileen Hannigan came to me in 1983,</i> an abused spouse. I'd heard the story a hundred times.</i> I went to the police. I got a restraining order.</i> Let me guess. He ignored it. He burned it in front of me. He do this? He said that if I ever tried to leave him, he would kill me. So I bought this. Are you ready to use that, Eileen? You don't want the gun. You don't want to give him the chance to use it on you. I'm gonna take care of this. Now, Lee Jay... I'm gonna say this once. You ever hurt Eileen again, you touch a hair on her head, I'm gonna come back, and I'm not gonna be so gentle. You tell me you understand me. I understand. Are you sure? I understand! Good. I thought I'd taken care of him,</i> but I was young and stupid back then.</i> I thought violence solved everything.</i> Hmm? Red or white? I will take... the red. I told you, not while I'm eating. It's your answering service. Says it's important. Yeah? Mick? It's Bobby Desmond. You'd better get down here. Looks like suicide- Gun in hand, shot through mouth.</i> Please, get help! Lee Jay! Lee Jay, what happened?</i> Hey, you got a story in the pipeline? Yeah, why Mick is so riled up about a 25-year-old case. Yeah, that's not a story. That's obvious. It was his father, right? That's the weird thing. His father wasn't a cop or a P.I. In fact, there's no record of him at all. Maybe you have the wrong name. No, I think there's something Mick isn't telling me. Lee Jay's arresting officer- Bobby Desmond. Maybe he can tell me why Mick's obsessed with this case. Retired. Still lives in L.A. What do you think? Go for it. So you never thought Eileen's shooting was a suicide either? Why hire somebody to protect you if you planned on killing yourself anyway? I heard Lee Jay got beat up pretty badly. Yeah, Mick did a number on him, that's for sure. But Lee Jay had it coming to him, and everybody knew that. - Like father, like son. - Huh? His son has a temper. Who does? His son Mick... Jr., I guess. He's obsessed with Lee Jay, just like his dad. No, no, no. Mick never had a son. Never married. Uh, Mick has a son. I know him. Darlin', I've known Mick St. John for over 35 years, and I'm telling you, there is no son. The man is one of a kind. Ask him yourself. He's alive? And kickin'. He was in here just the other day all riled up about Lee Jay's getting out. This is sad. You have, uh, w-what's the word, uh, food issues? How'd you get in here? 25 years on the inside, you get some skills. - Put that down. - Or what, you tear my head off? - Yeah. - But the thing is, I told everybody I know I was comin' over here to make peace. Now how would that look, huh? Oh, god. That's disgusting. How do you live like this? So what's the deal, Mick? You're-what, you're stronger than us? Smarter? I gotta admit that you're the only one who seems to see through my B.S. Or maybe it's just because you, uh, get me. We're not so different, really. - We're nothing alike. - No? Well, what's it feel like when you kill somebody? Because I know what it feels like when I do. Hey, easy, Mick. This is your gun, Mick- The one you keep hidden behind the desk. That's gotta be pretty annoying for you using this when you could tear somebody apart with your teeth. Another fake suicide, huh? Is that the plan? You're so smart. You tell me. Well, you better have the right ammunition. Oh, I do. Damn! 9-1-1. What is the nature of your emergency?</i> I've been shot. A Mick St. John. You know what? I see it now. It's like your own little prison, isn't it? - This whole vampire thing. - Shut up! You can't have anybody pokin' around-- A girlfriend, anyone who cares-- You got a problem. God, you're a bundle of nerves. Oh, yeah, the gun. You leave it, that looks bad. You take it, that looks even worse. You made the news. Great. Well, apparently, attempted murder, the charge against you, carries a 25-year penalty. The firearm enhancement adds another 15. That's what they called it- An "enhancement. " He's getting exactly what he wants-- Me in prison as payback and free rein - with no one to stop him. - And you get nothing. A prison is not the vampire's friend. No. No. But look on the positive side. You know, in 25 years, you could probably get a book deal. Oh, thank you. You're way off your game, pal. What did you say? You heard me. He had 25 years to plan his next move. - You wouldn't have seen it coming, either. - That's not even what I meant. Why didn't you kill him, Mick? Why didn't you take this guy out? - Why didn't you end him? - With Lee Jay alive, there's a chance the truth will come out. - You think so? - Yeah. It's not that you're worried about what some blonde reporter might think of you if you'd given that guy what he deserved? This is a chance for me to erase a regret. You know, I really don't see how. You're gonna have to split. You know that? You know, a new town, new identity. I know a guy who does relocations, you know? He works with a lot of vamps. I leave, more people die. No, man. I'm not going anywhere. I just got word they're releasing Lee Jay</i> from the hospital in a couple of hours. You've gotta get over there.</i> Fine, boss. On my way. Yeah, I wish I had a break like this when I was starting out.</i> What do you mean? Well, shooter on the lam, personal friend of yours--</i> That's "lucky" gift wrapped, girl. Go for it.</i> Okay, bye. Do you think he really tried to kill Lee Jay? What, you don't? - No, not really. - You're kidding, right? He attacks the guy in a public place. The guy ends up shot in his apartment, and then he flees. Is there some part of that that's not completely incriminating? You don't know him. You barely do, either. I think there's something going on that Mick's not telling me. You know... Since you met that guy... "screwed up" has started to seem normal. You're Mick St. John. Is Beth here? No. They're looking for you. - I didn't shoot Lee Jay. - Then why did you run? Why didn't you stay there and tell the police what happened? Because I'm a vampire. Because I'm a vampire... Because I'm a-- There is no good way to say it.</i> I guess I panicked. Look, he can't be here. You know that. I'm an attorney... I know. - In the D.A.'s office. - I know. I'm harboring a fugitive here. Listen, I understand this looks bad-- I'll get disbarred and jailed. I didn't do anything, okay? This guy comes to my place-- And what, shot himself? Yes. That's what Lee Jay does. He's staged murders before. It's all in the police file. See for yourself, Josh. I need to know that you're telling the truth. I am. You know I am. Because if you're not... What do you need me to do? I know. I said my image couldn't be captured,</i> but that was back in the days of silver emulsion and film.</i> Digital has changed all that. Okay, it's gonna be best if you look straight into camera. Okay, ready? On my count. The truth is, I'm innocent. I did not shoot Lee Jay Spalding.</i> Spalding staged the scene and shot himself.</i> - I can't believe she's doing this. - Now I know it sounds improbable, but this is a very sick individual</i> who's done this twice before.</i> The first time was in 1982, when he faked the suicide death</i> of his first wife Marie McCullough,</i> who had the nerve to try to leave him.</i> The second time was when... CDS-LA News has just obtained this dramatic new video that has surfaced on the Internet</i> ...very suspicable circumstances... ...a fact suppressed from the trial</i> and omitted from the book. The two case files are available to the public...</i> - How could she? - ...at buzzwirenews.com. Please read them for yourselves. I'm not asking for sympathy. - Hey, beautiful. - You okay? Let's get you out of here. Are you feeling better, Lee Jay? Yeah. Luckily, he missed the major arteries. Why does Mick St. John have such a vendetta against you? Don't ask me to understand the workings of a criminal mind. What about the report on "buzzwire" that you've murdered two women and staged the shooting that hospitalized you? That report would be incorrect. Okay, let's go. All right, no more questions. What about the shooting, Lee Jay? Would you like to make any comments about the allegations of these murders? That's all. I can't believe how many media outlets have picked this story up. "Buzzwire"'s got the biggest syndicated feed on the net. So what's next, though? I think it's his move next. It's Julia. Okay, I know you must be furious with me, and I know you love him and all that, but it's true, Julia, and you really had to know. I know, Beth. I know. Put him on. Put him on! Put him on! What do you want? You watch your tone with me. What do you want? You do not talk to me that way! You forget who you're talkin' to! I know what you are, Mick. Now here's what I want. I want you to go down to the nearest police station, and I want you to turn yourself in. I didn't do anything. I'm not gonna say I did. You know what? If you feel that way about it, then Julia ends up like Eileen. How do I know you won't kill her anyway? You don't. You got one hour. Please. Help me. Please! You hear that? Hard to say no, isn't it? Look, if you don't turn yourself in, he's gonna kill her. He's gonna kill her anyway. I think we should go to the police. They can trace the call. We only have one hour. We need more time than that. You do not talk to me that way!</i> You forget who you're talkin' to.</i> I know what you are, Mick. I got a friend in public affairs. Maybe I can get him to issue some kind of statement that-- ...that Mick's turned himself in, that he's in custody. - Okay. Okay. - And what will you do? All I need is some time. Here, take this. It'll help. - Hurry. - All right. Hey, Josh... Thank you. You tried to warn me Julia was in danger. Yeah, well, none of us want to believe that there's monsters like Lee Jay right around us. You did. I think I have a way of finding them. I tagged Julia's car. You want to navigate? What did he mean, "I know what you are"? Oh, right here. Mick, what did he mean? I don't know. I don't believe you. How about we get Julia first? How about you finally answer a question without evading or disappearing? Hour's almost up. Like that. We all have secrets, Beth... And that's not evading. Right here. Okay, stop, stop, stop. All right, I'm goin' in. Open the glove box. Now do you know how to use that? You remember what I said? Call the cops if you're not out in ten minutes. Don't come inside. I got it, I got it. Okay. Why does the girl always have to wait in the car? ...confirmed reports that fugitive Mick St. John,</i> wanted in connection with the shooting of Lee Jay Spalding,</i> has turned himself in to authorities at the Wilshire division.</i> Well, our work here's done. Run. Don't believe everything you see on tv. Silver buckshot. Had to special order it. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but, uh, silver's like poison to you. The only thing more deadly to a vampire... Fire. Now I gotta admit that part of me wonders what it would be like... to live forever... Powerful. The last thing this world needs is an eternal you. I thought I told you to stay in the car. Don't ever let anybody hold you back.</i> I don't care who they are or how tough they think they are.</i> You look them straight in the eye,</i> and you say, "I'm better than you,</i> "I'm stronger than you, and I'm going to win. " He-He kidnapped me. He was gonna kill me. It's okay. It's okay. Slow down. Mick-Mick saved me. Mick saved me. I was so wrong. - Okay, so Mick shot Lee Jay? - No. No, I did. Hey, hey, hey! Beth! Where you goin'? Beth, get back here. Mick? You ran off again. One second you were there, and then you were... gone. Are... are you okay? Please leave. Not without answers. I keep dreaming about you. Why? Please, don't look at me. Oh, my god. What are you? I'm a vampire. Transcript: Raceman
