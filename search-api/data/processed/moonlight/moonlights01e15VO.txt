I know you must be older, but you look about 30. I'm gonna be 85 this november. It can't be all that bad to live forever. Yeah, but it's not so fun to experience things alone. I haven't been in a romantic relationship with a human since I became a vampire. What happens when a vampire thinks he's about to be exposed? He moves on, starts all over. As long as you're involved with mick and you work at "buzzwire," his secret will always be in nger. I have something to tell you. I quit "buzzwire." If you hadn't been a vampire, I'd have died 23 years ago. Being a vampire isn't all you are. I got your message. Wow, look at you. Thanks for coming by so early. Get you a coffee? - Yeah. - All right. - Hey, how's it going? - Two coffees. So how's unemployment treating you? I know quitting "buzzwire" was the right decision, but I don't know. Being noble and unemployed isn't everything you dreamed it would be? Thanks. I have been baking... a lot. I'm sure. Let's sit here. So you, um... you hear about the little boy who was abducted last night? I covered two similar kidnapping cases for "buzzwire" last year. Do you think it's the same guy? I do. Yeah, so pulled your reports. Very well researched. They're really insightful. Didn't help. The boys were still found dead within a week of their abductions, and the cops never caught the guy. Well, that's why I want you to come with me-- take a look at the crime scene. Oh, I'm not a profiler. No, but you've already done the legwork on the last two victims. There's gotta be some kind of connection. Maybe you'll see something we're missing. How could you not know a roche-bobois couch from a manutti? You invite me to a night on the town. I'm thinking jazz, cigars, maybe a fresh-from-the-vein pitcher of sangria, not window-shopping for couches. so sue me.My new office is almost ready, and I just fired my bonehead designers. I mean, 4:00 A.M. Really is the best time to browse. So are we gonna find your designers at the bottom of the tar pits? Nick, please. I don't have the energy to kill everyone who pisses me off. I have to hire some people. Oh, blood, juice, day, night-- you know, a few weeks as a human, and my body still can't work out what it wants. Yeah, well, blood orange juice must be particularly confusing. Well, I'm sorry about your jet lag... or maybe I should say human lag. But I am feeling the call of subzero oblivion. ******** this is my son jacob. He just turned 6. He's 45 pounds, just under 4 feet... you are positively pavlovian where that girl is concerned. Brown hair, brown eyes... please, whoever you are, bring my son back. mick! You're not here with "buzzwire"? No, talbot asked me to come. Why are you here? I grew up in this neighborhood. - You grew up here? - Beth? Go ahead. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Okay. josef thought it was seeing beth that drew me here, but it wasn'T. It was the house and the people who once lived in it-- my buddy ray, his wife lilah. Mick? Keep an eye on him. You know he trips over his own shoelaces. Well, if he does, I'll be there to pick him up. be safe, ray. I love you. I'll be home soon, lilah. You can count on that. we'd been friends all our lives. I loved them... and then I betrayed them. -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font> -=www.ydy.com/bbs=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ</font> Moonlight Season01 Episode15</font> all the detectives are upstairs. Uh, I'm actually A... I'm a private investigator. Mick st. John. - Robert fordham. - Good to meet you, sir. I think there's a mistake. Uh, I didn't call anyone. No, I-I volunteered my help. I-I grew up right down the street. I can't believe this is happening. I'm really very sorry. These your parents? Yeah. My folks passed away a few years ago. You know them? Kind of. I-I didn't know they had any children. Just me. I was a baby boomer. Mr. Fordham, why don't you go have a seat with your wife? - We still have some questions. - Okay. Mr. St.John, I don't know who let you in here-- uh, detective, there's a child missing. We can use all the help we can get. - Thanks. - Yeah. - They'll, uh, finish the interview up in there. - Okay. Had anyone been bothering jacob at school, on the playground? no, he would have told us. You said he was having nightmares. Was he seeing a doctor? No, no. It's nothing like that. He's 6. He has a big imagination. Every little creak he heard was a monster. he--he said he heard tapping coming from the walls. I checked the crawl spaces. I put rattraps in the attic. it's okay. Detective? Okay, you guys, take a minute. Hey,ou mind if I, uh, take a look in the boy's room? Forensics are still working. Come back in a couple hours. Yeah, great. Couple of hours so they can trample anything useful. The cops never found blood or prints at the previous scenes. Hey, do you know robert? What? No, why? I--you're--I don't know. You're acting kind of odd. No. So you think it's the same guy who took the other boys? Well, the M.O.Is exactly the same-- little boy taken from his home while his parents slept. No sign of forced entry. Perp is a ghost. Yeah, or a vampire. Were any of the other victims missing blood? Do you have anyone in mind? Yeah, somebody talbot won't know about. My name didn't ring a bell with robert. I guess I shouldn't be surprised lilah and ray never mentioned me. Damn, this makes k rations seem gourmet. File a complaint. oh, wait a minute. We're in the middle of nowhere fighting germans. This isn't nowhere. It's a forest... in italy. ohh, what I wouldn't give for one of lilah's sunday dinners right now. I mean, not only does she have lana turner's legs and garbo's laugh, but my wife could cook a ham so juicy, it'd tempt a rabbi. ray, stop! Ray saved my life several times, and I sad his a time or two. That's what happens when you're fighting a war. You know, when I, uh, asked you here, it wasn't a group invitation. Oh, I didn't call mick. It just seems wherever one of you goes, the other one isn't far behind. What? Look at the toys. Okay, so the kid's a little O.C.D. No, it's a defensive line. If a monster showed up, he'd have to break through the perimeter and make enough noise to wake jacob. Is that what you did after you were taken as a child? How do you know about that? It's my business to know. Come on. Tell me you didn't google me after we first met, huh? Every vamp knows children's blood is more pure-- less free radicals. But some crave it 'cause they think it tastes better-- like something cooked in butter instead of margarine. Leo is one of those vamps. He's also the nervous type. If jacob heard tapping on the walls, I may have found the mouse. Tell me you didn't take that kid in west adams last night, leo. Mick, you wound me. I'm not some kind of pervert. And I'm not the cops, leo, but I will get the truth before I leave. The only question is easy way... hard way? I didn't take him. Children are a precious gift. I just like their blood. Where do you get it? Runaways mostly. I buy 'em booze and then tap a vein while they're sleeping it off. You kill them? Hell, no. I even leave 'em cash-- more than they'd get at the blood bank. Ask anybody. Leave... the runaways... alone, leo. what kind of monster were you and talbot talking about? Oh, I was just wondering if there is any kind of real-life explanation for jacob's fears. You mean someone he knew? Right, somebody who had a key, like a housekeeper you fired or an angry ex-wife. No. No, there's no one like that. Is that photo from world war ii? Yeah, that's my dad-- ray fordham. His squad was stationed in italy. Robert was a child of the baby boom, all right. Thousands of reunited couples celebrating life had thousands of babies, but robert was only born seven months after ray got home. hey, so I saw a photo of you at robert'S. You were in the war with his father. Why didn't you tell me you wanted to help because you knew the family? Because they could be my family. Your family? How? years before I became a vampire, I was just another soldier in world war ii. Ray was my best friend. In the late summer of 1944, we were fighting together in italy. where's that coming from? That's the road to florence. Okay, let's move out. take cover! Ray, are you in the open? Get over here! ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! It's okay. My legs feel funny. Are they still there? Yeah, of course. Two good legs, and I still gotta run to you. You stay with me, ray, okay? - take care of lilah, okay? - Shut the hell up. You're gonna take care of her yourself. Tell her... that I love her. tell her. I'll tell her, ray. ray? a week later, I woke up in a field hospital, wounded but alive. They told me I was the only one who survived from that patrol, and eight months later, I was back in the states. Of course lilah knew that ray was gone, but... I just-- I needed to see her. We were devastated. And then a week later, the war in europe was over, and there were parades in the streets. There were picnics. Everybody was starting over. mick! Take a break. I swear, you're gonna start fixing things that aren't even broke. I like to keep busy. I know that feeling. It works until I close my eyes at night. You know, I can't believe a woman who built airplanes for three years can't change a fuse. it's not that I can'T. Ray just always used to take care of some things. He wanted me to take care of you. Well, you do, nick. You do. So, uh, you started over with lilah. I know h it sounds. But you... it just... kind of happened. It didn't-- it just happened. So you think robert... how could you not know you had a son? When I left lilah, I had no idea she was pregnant. I checked robert's birthday. It's possible. Why did you leave her? Because ray survived. He was in a coma for months. He lost his dog tags. The army didn't know who he was. When ray turned up, I made myself scarce. What else could I do? I left my best friend for dead, and then I stole his wife. It was wrong. It wasn't wrong if it was love. Was it love? Yeah. Yeah, I think it was. It's getting late. Cops should be done by now. Yeah. Listen, thanks for letting us have a look around on our own. Yeah, well, like I said, you know, C.S.I.And police have combed every inch. I-I don't care who finds jacob, as long as he's found. It's strange to have a son who looks old enough to be your father. You seem... familiar somehow. Oh, he was all over tmz last week. No. Do--do I maybe know your family? No, I don't think so. excuse me. this was a human crime. There's no scent of vampire in here. hey, can't you smell if robert's your son? No. It's not that specific. Can you get a D.N.A.Test? Wouldn't work. My D.N.A.Was fundamentally altered when I became a vampire. What about pre-vamp D.N.A.? I have a lot of skills. Time travel is not one of them. Now what about a lock of hair from a family bible, something like that? Maybe. I didn't keep much from when I was human, though. Is that fingerprint powder? No, it's--it's powdered metal. C.S.I.Has probably bagged a sample. Lucky for us we have the mobile vampire lab. Let's take a look upstairs. Jacob's room... would be right under here. He was here. This is where he watched jacob. And this is the door he came in. Who's had physical access to the attic? we renovated last year. Other than the contractor, there were dozens of workmen. Okay. We're gonna need those names. If he made a secret way into jacob's room, maybe he made a secret way into the house. Or found one that's already here. A lot of these old houses had coal chutes... like this one. And it's a way into the house. It's been opened recently. Once he was in the kitchen, he could take the servants' stairs to the attic and take his time. To take my son. So jacob was right. The monster was in the walls. And in the floors and in the ceilings. how did you know about the coal chute? I grew up in a house like this. Here in L.A.? Yeah. And what school did you go to? You investigating me now? Depends. You got something to hide? No, not anymore. The paparazzi exposed my deepest secrets-- shoe size 10 1/2, favorite color blue. Boxers, not briefs. How did we get on to this delightful subject? We digressed. Look, I know the other two crime scenes were in different parts of the city, but they're all turn-of-the-century victorians. Maybe our guy worked on all of them. You should check and see if they have coal chutes. That would explain how he got in. I'll have our guys check it out. This is, uh, every piece of paper from the renovation last year-- every work order, invoice-- every suspect.That's a lot of names. Well, then we need to get started. Thank you. - Yeah. - thanks. I'll make some coffee. It's after 3:00. You know, why don't you, uh, try to get some sleep? Easier said than done. Robert's D.N.A.One sample down, one to go. You should try to get some rest, too. Yeah, it's hard to sleep knowing jacob's out there with this nut. We'll get him back. We have to. The D.A.'S office will narrow it down. - Ben's got a good team. - "Ben"? - should I be jealous? - Of course. Even if I have no romantic interest in him, your jealousy makes me feel desirable. Maybe I can't time travel, and I definitely don't have a lock of hair in the family bible. But every soldier has to fit his life into a box. This I kept. So robert's contractor's legit, but he hired a lot of labor off the books. So they could either be nice guys from the home depot parking lot or convicted felons. But I did have better luck with the other crime scenes. Both houses have been renovated within the last year. The first victim was taken from a 1911 victorian in ocean park. The second was taken from a 1903 victorian in pasadena. Do they both have coal chutes? No, but ocean park had a wine cellar with an access door, and pasadena had an in-floor heating system riddled with a bunch of old steam tunnels. Both had been sealed up for decades. - Have they both been opened recently? - Yep. I bet you $100 even the owners didn't know those entrances existed. You'd win. You ever think of becoming a civilian investigator? Uh, I did some investigating at "buzzwire," but I'm not a cop. You don't have to be, but, uh, you would have to work for me. Is that a job offer? Yeah, it is. I thought my human past was dead, hidden away in storage. But now I find out it might be alive and well, living in a house in west adams. But only my human D.N.A.Will tell me for sure. Nice footlocker. Did you mug an army guy? Josef. To what do i owe this pleasure? I left my cell phone here yesterday. I spent 400 years without one. Now I can't go a day... so, G.I.Mick, why the trip down memory lane? I need D.N.A.To confirm that I fathered a child with my best friend's wife after the war. Never a dull moment, huh? I'll give you that. Come on. Give me your best shot. I know you're dying to. You want the truth? I'm jealous. See, I've sired plenty of vamps in my day, but, uh... no rug rats... that I know of. Guess they'd all be dust by now, so it's kind of a moot point, but... yeah, you know, it's one of my only regrets... and I don't believe in regrets. That boy who was kidnapped... he might be my grandson. I know. I hope you get the kid back. Your last contribution to the human gene pool, huh? Yeah. I guess he is. Unless you and beth, uh, rewrite the rules of vampire love and figure out how to procreate. Hi, beth. beth's here. What'd you find out? Uh, I think the kidnapper saw the original blueprints of the victims' houses. Yould cou get those online? No, all hard copies are filed at the county assessor's office. He would have had to physically sign them out. Okay. I'll drop you at the hall of records. Oh, you found it? Yeah. Pre-vampire D.N.A. - Well, we should take it to bionalysis. - Okay. oh, the lab promised to rush the D.N.A.Results. We should know by tomorrow. So about what josef said... what, that we can't have a baby? You want to have my baby? What do you think of "elliot" for a boy? I'm kidding. Relax. But I mean, children are a part of most normal human relationships. Our relationship being neither normal nor human. But josef was right. Vampires can't have kids. So... I mean, if it's a al breaker-- I think we're getting ahead of ourselves. I mean, we haven't even slept with each other yet. It may not be any good. Look, let's just focus on getting jacob back, and we'll worry about our children when the time comes. Yeah. Bye. I already went through all this with the police. I understand it's a lot of names, but I need you to try to remember faces, voices, anyone who was off-kilter at all. Hey, hey, it's okay. - just--let's just take a breath. - Okay. Okay? We--we had jacob late in life. He was our little miracle, you know? Just like I was for my folks. Why were you a miracle? 'Cause my father was partially paralyzed when he came back from the war. They didn't think that he could have any kids... and then I came along seven months later. I was the biggest preemie my-- my mother's doctor ever saw. He was big because he wasn't premature. He was mine. Robert, I... how do you tell a man twice your age that you're his father? You don'T. I'm gonna get jacob back. Thank you. just, you know... I never thought that I'd ever have a son, you know? yeah, I know. Okay, so listen, these workmen... were any of them especially interested in jacob? Oh, it's chaos when you're renovating, you know? It's a lot of--aot of dust and noise, people everywhere. Wait a minute. There was this one guy that, well, he liked to work at night. Did--did-- did he ever speak to jacob? Maybe once or twice. I think he did the, uh, the metalwork on the roof. It was, uh, kevin... it was ken... verdolino. Ken verdolino? That's him. hello? have you figured it out yet? Verdolino? Yeah, and you're mick st. John, the P.I.Who drives the old mercedes. You've been watching me? It's what I do. Where's jacob? Jacob's mine now. Stay away. We can talk about this in person, ken. Come on. How about I talk to your blonde friend instead? She's lonely all by herself among the files and the bookshelves. I always did like the smart girls. hello? Hey, I'm still in here. Can you turn the lights on, please? hello? flashlight. hello? hello? Beth! Beth! You okay? mick, there's somebody in there. He's watching me. Listen to me. His name is ken verdolino. He's the guy who took jacob, okay? You have to stay here. - Listen. Stay here. - Okay. okay, I got it. Thank you. He's long gone. If you keep sneaking up on me like that, I am gonna mace you one of these days. Well, it's only a matter of time. Who was that? It was ben. He's got verdolino's adadess from the D.M.V. It's 1532 hobart in west adams. He's getting a search warrant. Why don't we pull verdolino's blueprints while we're here? This is them? 1532 hobart? That's right under the freeway. And there's a basement. That's gotta be where he's holding jacob. Let's go. Mick, wait. Mick. Mick! I know this boy means a lot to you, but we should wait for the warrant. You want to play it by the book while this guy could be moving jacob or worse? I-I just don't want you to spook him. He might do something desperate. I know what I'm doing. ************ they tore houses down years ago to make room for the freeway, but they left scars behind-- basements for monsters to hide in. Cops are on their way. You let jacob go, you can walk out of here alive. Verdolino likes the dark. Fine by me. Ken verdolino! L.A.P.D.! Open up! Break it down. Clear! Clear! ****** I know how you feel, ken-- always on the outside looking in, always alone, always in the dark. that's why I can't let him go. We all have to learn there's nothing to fear in the dark. You think kidnapping him and terrorizing him is therapy? Clear! - I thought st. John said verdolino was re. - He did. Yeah, but no sign of either of 'em. No, I saw mick's car outside. He's still here somewhere. Once jacob gets over his fear, he's free to go. How can he get over his fear when he's cold and alone? Life's cold, mick. It's a harsh lesson we all gotta learn. Actually, you're pretty close. Closer than you think. Where's jacob? You tell me where he is now! - Oh, my god! - He's got a gun! Why aren't you scared? - It's over. - So it is. And now jacob's gonna die alone and scared because of you. No! - Come on! - okay, come on, come on. Let's go. Jacob? Jacob! Jacob, if you can hear me, you gotta make a noise, buddy. Jacob? Beth, hold on. There's nothing here. You heard the gunshots. He's here. I know he's here. Yeah, all right. Jacob, you gotta give me a sign! Come on, kid. jacob. Wait. Beth, beth. Guys! Guys, I found something! jacob? Jacob! jacob. Come on, jacob, breathe. Breathe! okay. Okay. Come on. there's someone moving down there. This is L.A.P.D.Come out slowly with your hands up. It's mick st.John. I have jacob. It's st. John. Stand down. - Clear me! - You're clear. - Where e ththparamedics? - There. - Where's verdolino? - He killed himself. You're okay. he's gonna be okay. the D.N.A.Test. The lab sent it over this morning. robert's not my son. Good for you, ray. - I'm sorry. - No. No, this is the way it's supposed to be. I just didn't know how much I wanted a family until I almost had one, you know? Family's not only about D.N.A. jacob. Hey, buddy. - look, it's mick. - I know, I know. I-I just saw him pull up. We'll go say hi. No, in the picture. {\a6}<font color="#00FFFF">"The Nearness of You"</font> * it's not the pale moon that excites me * * and thrills and delights me * * oh, no * * it's just the nearness of you * -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-
