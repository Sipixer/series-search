understand how i catch him. besides, the enemy guys take things, i am leaving something behind. ??? no.$200 of high tech security equipment is not ???? u keep an eye on, aren't u? there's two rats, meeting. one fall down. otherwise alone. u could work days, i wouldn't need the bugs. vicki, i was wondering, what are you going to do tomorrow night? I was going to type up the transcripts from the wire taps. Why? I have a piece in a gallery show and I was wondering if... A fine art show? The show is called 'Dark Visions'. Every piece is inspired by the dark side of human nature. And you want me to accompany you? It's rare that I expose myself to the public in this way, and I wanted to share it with someone special. yeah, of course.I'd be honoured. I'm just surprised that you don't want to take one of those, you know, artsy babes you usually like to chow down on. You're different. You'll give me an honest opinion. And I think you might have some interest in the subject of my painting. Well, an invitation and a mystery. How can I refuse that? Very well. A real date, huh? Did I mention there's somebody coming up the stairs? No. There's somebody coming up the stairs. Okay. You know what? Your sentry skills leave a little bit to be desired. This is Maya. Inspire. where the hell are you? After what you laid on me last night, the least you could have done was show up when you said you would. I've got a gallery full of blank walls, a show opening tomorrow night and no one to help me hang it. Only the barest optimism on my part made me dream that for once, you might deign to keep a promise. Honesty is obviously just not your strong suit, is it? I hope whoever you're with understands that. Oh, don't worry. I won't wait up. Why are you swinging, friend? You didn't have to deal with Maya. Hello? Oh, don't play games. I'm in no mood. www.1000fr.com Present Capture:xxy¡¢lanmao¡¢QQ Sync:FRM@mywsz</font> blood tie s2e6 Hey! Our little wiretap paid off. It turns out that guy was selling R and D to China. Which is now how far he's gonna have to go to get a job. Are you okay? Yes. There's just been a little hiccup with the gallery opening tonight. Let me guess. You want to take someone else. It's a little more complicated than that. The gallery owner went missing. Don't they usually do that after the show flops? His girlfriend, Maya, asked me to help find him. I naturally thought of you. Naturally. She's a talented artist and a sweet girl... loyal, loving... Is this an introduction or a sales pitch? She's a good friend. I hate to see her worried like this. All right, bring the little girlfriend down here. I'll talk to her. I knew you'd take it on. Maya? You're the private eye? Yeah, Vicki Nelson. Oh, nice ink. You, too. The motif's an o> ginal. Is that a Bartani? Uh...no... It's, um...Astaroth. I thought I knew all the body artists in town. He must be new. So, tell me about your boyfriend. Jude was supposed to be hanging a show but he disappeared. No message? No idea where he went? Jude likes to stage these little tantrums from time to time. Ah, you mean he bails when you fight. Yes. And he left me a nasty message yesterday afternoon when I didn't show up to help. Henry But he never leaves so close to an opening. Well, Jude is colourful but he's not insane. So, where were you yesterday? Why weren't you helping hang the show? I was out living life. Opening myself up to the universe. Seeking inspiration. Okay, um... Here's what I can do. Jude really hasn't been missing that long so the best I can do at this point is call a few hotels, see if he's hiding out anywhere. And, uh...when I come to the gallery tonight I'll ask his friends,see if they know anything. Just like Jude, isn't it? So selfish. Thank you. Sweet? Loving? Loyal? She's... I have to help open the gallery. Coreen? Okay. So, um...you know, get out there, work the crowd, see if anyone knows where Jude's hiding. I love this. I love hanging out with artists. Well, that's good. That makes one of us. Okay, go, go, go. Be pretentious, or whatever it is that they do. What in the...! Henry...! Ay, chihuahua! That one's mine, so don't get any ideas. Ah. Fitzroys don't come on the market very often. Thank you. To get these you have to be quick. All the sculptors have hollow legs. Ha, ha. Those crazy sculptors. I'm sorry. I didn't realize you're the inspiration. How delightful. Yeah. Fitzroy really does bridge the gap between illustration and fine art, doesn't he? Yes. Henry bridges a lot of gaps. I'm kind of a patron of this little gallery. When it comes to scraping the zeitgeist and wringing out the juice, no one has a better eye than Jude. Speaking of Jude, I would love to congratulate him. Actually, I don't think we'll be seeing him tonight. It's the usual fireworks, I'm afraid, Jude and Maya. Another rough patch, huh? Not much left to patch. I hear Maya's about ready to close the Jude show and mount something new. Do tell. Um... How do you like the show? It's okay. Don't get me wrong. I'm all about the dark. But some of this stuff, it's just... it's trying too hard. You know, "Look at me. I'm dark. I'm depressed. I wanna cut my ear off." But this piece? This piece rocks. I love the dichotomy, the pastoral landscape, the hint of violence in the window. You can't help but be drawn to it. Well, that's cool. Really? Why? No way! Really? This is your piece? Yup. So you... you really love it? You do? Thank you. Oh! Oh, it's cold! All right, let's see what we've got here. It's kind of creepy how he's all like...posed like that. Are you getting ideas for your Christmas cards? You know, he might fit on top of the tree. Hold on. Are we getting lucky today, baby! The man's got a wallet. Oh yeah? Let's take a look at this. Okay. We have a winner. Jude Marstens. Good evening, ladies. It's a pleasure to see you. Thanks. Thank you. What? You're wearing a dress. Yes, I know. And I'm ready for the jokes. Come on. Say what you have to say. You're beautiful. I think you should just stick to the jokes. So what did you find out? Um...Jude's friends, they fall into two categories. Maya haters, who think she's arrogant and bossy. And the ones who think the sun shines out of her... 'Assertive' is the term her friends use. Maya has her moments. All right, so tell me. What is it between the two of you? We're friends. We met at a show a couple of months ago. I enjoyed her vision and her work. Friends. Oh, come on. She's a little young for me, don't you think? Isn't everybody? By the way, I think you owe me a little commission over there. Well, did I at least get the gun right? You know I prefer Barettas. Well, Missy, and what did you find out? Tyrone's a Leo, Jupiter rising. He's been painting since he was twelve. This is his first show. And he's allergic to goose down. Did you find anything out about Jude? Oh, right. Tyrone said Jude's got it rough, as Maya's high maintenance. Maya sees and experiences the world directly. It's part of her process not to censor herself. It's admirable, not odd. and what did you say your name was? Ah, there's Maya right now not censoring herself. She looks awful broken up about Jude's disappearance. Excuse me. Just friends. Right. Hey, that's the same mark Maya has tattooed on her arm. It must be a signature type thing, it's very artsy. Hm. I'm going to go grab my camera from the coat check. Was Jude Marstens ever a painter himself? I don't know. Why? Detective Mike Celluci. If he was, I think the price of his work just went up. So what can you tell me about Jude's movements on that last day? We didn't see each other all day. I assumed he got caught up in theashow. People say that you fought that night. Yes, we fought. Yes, we did it a lot. We're passionate people. But I didn't kill him and I don't know who did. All right. I may have more questions for you so don't go too far. Is it too much to ask for you to be a little more humane? Oh, I'm sorry, only humans get to ask for humane. You have to help me prove she's innocent. I will help you find Jude Marstens' killer. And that is as much as I can promise. Thanks, Doc. By the way, Captain Midnight is way out of line. Keep him on a short leash, okay? Wow, that was a lot of testosterone. So do you have anything juicy for me? Plenty. He drowned. But they found him in a vacant lot. Oh, I didn't say anything about water. It's paint. You found paint in his lungs? oil paint. His lungs are filled with it. It must have been quite unpleasant. How did it get there? Did they put a tube down his throat? No, there'd be bruising around the trachea or palate. Did they make him swallow it? No sign of paint on the teeth, gums, mandible, maxilla, or Eustachian tube. The way the paint beaded it appears to have come from within. How does that even happen? I don't know. It's impossible. Isn't that grand? Thanks for helping me do this. I don't mind. It's a tough time. You could use the help. Is there anything you didn't tell the police? I did talk to Jude earlier, right here. We fought. Was it a normal fight? No...worse. He found out I was having an affair. He went ballistic. We broke up, but I said I'd come back and help hang the show anyway. You will not remember this conversation. You'll be calm. And you will believe that everything will be all right. You might as well help me finish this wine. I'm good. Paint in his lungs? No idea how it got there? That's odd. You're really learning to work the understatement, Henry. Hey, did Maya ever dabble in witchcraft? Not that I know of. I was just wondering about those symbols she signs her paintings with, the one she has tattooed on her arm. Merely an artistic conceit, like that singer. Or did he go back to his real name? Come on, Henry. We both know symbols can channel power. They can be very dangerous in the wrong hands. If she's dabbling in something she doesn't understand... I interrogated her. She's not involved. So what...that's it? No more investigation? Not of Maya. Jude must have had his own enemies. Hm. Well, according to people at the gallery it was Maya. She was having a few, um...indiscretions. So? If she was having an affair, she would tell you, right? Did she tell you? Yes. And no. Well, it's obvious you're protecting her from something. I guess the question is, what? I was emotionally committed to Jude. Translation... 'I saw other people.' All right, I'm going to need a list of names. This is completely irrelevant. You try and hide this kind of thing from the police, it will come back and bite you on the ass. I guarantee it. And they? They will t be as nice as I am. This is nice? Hello? I want to pay for my paintings if now's okay. Perfect timing, Angus darling. It's nice to see a friendly face. I have to run a business. Could we please talk later? Well, hello again. I look forward to nailing you to my wall. You're going to need a bigger hammer. You know, I don't care what Henry says, Maya's lying. She knows something about Jude's murder. You know who you should ask? Tyrone. He's known her since she was still Enid Wyman. I bet she's a full-blown witch. I mean, everyone that Henry is involved in, they just love the black magic. I do not love the black magic. Well, it loves you. Listen, if he asks about me, just play it cool, okay? Thank you for helping me take my mind off my grief. I want you to know I'm here for you. And maybe, well, perhaps in the future we could... Could we not talk about this? It's just that, uh... now that you're free... You know how it was with Jude. My heart is broken right now. Oh, I doubt that, love. Beneath that smoking exterior, you're as cold as ice. When I get out of the shower I'd like for you to be gone. You can leave a cheque on the bar. It's open. Hi. I'm Vicki Nelson. I think Coreen said I was going to come by? The investigator? Oh, hey. Hey, am I interrupting anything? No, uh...no. You gotta cover it, you know, or else the dust gets in the white paint. Oh sure, sure. Uh...Coreen? She works for you? Yeah. Yeah, she's my right hand. Uh...she said you knew Enid, uh...Maya. Yeah, well, I knew Enid better than I know Maya, that's for sure. Listen, I kind of suck at small talk so I'll just cut to the chase. I need to know if you know whether or not Maya was stepping out on Jude. Uh...yeah, Angus Stratham's been sniffing around for months. I mean, why do you think he's buying all those paintings? Ahh...of course. Can I um... No! I'm just not comfortable showing it yet. Just a peek? No! Leave it! Seriously, it's not ready yet. Okay. Hey, listen. Um...I was thinking of getting tickets for the Warhol show. Do you know how Coreen feels about Warhol? I have no idea. But, here's my card. Number's at the bottom. She answers the phone. So you can ask her yourself, Picasso. Thanks for the info. Thank you. I'll let you get back to it. Did someone move my painting? Angus? Hello? No gunshots, no knife wounds. Probably suffocation, just like the last one. The body's still relatively warm. Rigor mortis hasn't set in. No, this guy's been dead less than four hours. No wallet this time, either. Can't win 'em all, right? Yeah. So what did the witness have to say? The body appeared between 2:45 and 3:00 o'clock. That's a pretty narrow window. She's sure about the time? She was racing home to watch her stories. It's 4:00 o'clock now. I'd put the time of death,let's say, noon. Could have been a lover's quarrel. Yeah, lipstick. I saw that. Skyrockets in flight baby, you know what I'm saying? I mean, a little nooner never hurt anybody! Except maybe him. Okay, so... We've got two dead bodies and a chair in the same empty parking lot. What do you want to bet these guys are unrelated, huh? Nah, I ain't taking that action, baby. No kidding. What the hell is he supposed to be looking at, anyway? All right. From here to Jude Marstens' gallery it's, what... 20, 30 minutes, tops? Depending on traffic? That's plenty of time for the body to get here. You know what I'm saying. The middle of the day, though? That's pretty ballsy. Yes, it is. All right, let's see where the coroner's at. Here's a nice one, "If you brand this symbol into the forehead of your enemy, he will be dead within a week." Nice. That's a deadly talisman. Yeah well, talismans don't kill people. People kill people. Here it is! I knew I'd seen it before. That is it. Let's see..."the symbol for protection from evil..." Specifically protection from demons. Well, thank you very much, 'Corwin's Demonology'. Where do you get all this stuff, anyway? Used bookstores, Internet, yard sales... So listen, if you don't need anything else here... You've got plans. Yeah. Go. Get out. Thank you. It's nice that everyone else has plans. Does the name Angus Stratham mean anything to you? Um...yeah. Yeah, he's a patron of Maya's. He bought three pieces at the opening. Hm. Anything else? I'm pretty sure they're having an affair. We'll be able to prove it soon enough. He's dead? Body found in the same vacant lot as Jude Marstens', lungs filled with paint. The last time his assistant saw him alive he was heading over to the gallery to finalize a deal. I know. I was there. Really?Well, that makes you the secy?d last person to see him alive, Maya being the last. She's looking more hinky by the minute. Listen to this. Six years ago, Maya, a.k.a. Enid Wyman, stabbed her boyfriend with a palette knife. She insisted that it was just performance art. Her boyfriend didn't even press charges. Well, what about the paint in the lungs? Oh, the way I see it, it's her signature. Just another creative act of violence. Turns people into artistic statements. She'd have to be pretty messed up to do that. Selfish to the point of sociopathic. Henry says she's innocent. What do you think? I don't know. At this point, I have enough to bring her in for questioning. But, um... I might need your help with this one. Henry? Yeah. If he's protecting her, who knows what he'll do. Well, Vicki Nelson vampire wrangler,at your service. Who's this one? One of my mother's first boyfriends. I can't even rember his name. I think it was Reinhold? No. Heinrich? Harold? This picture's called 'Mother'. Is that your mother? She was beautiful. You would have liked her, Henry. She was a great artist. Like mother, like daughter. I'm a complete clone... the art, the bad relationship choices. At least, unlike Mom, none of my boyfriends ever hit me... without my consent. Where did that come from? It's a dream that I've had. Ever since I was an infant. My mother is with this man. They're happy and laughing. And then, in the blink of an eye, he becomes this 'thing', all claws and fangs. And he devours her. And as he's devouring her, he looks up. He sees me, and he smiles. He sounds like a monster. No. Those boyfriends came afterwards. Actually, I think I loved him. It's pretty screwed up, huh? Welcome to the club. Her cheeks are too flush. I'm sorry for everything you went through. Why are you sorry? It wasn't your fault. Maya, no. I thought you wanted this. We shouldn't. We can do whatever we want. You don't want me. You don't think of me that way. No, Henry. I, uh... I can't. I, uh...don't even think of you that way. I understand. Detective? Fitzroy. Ms. Wyman. That's not my name. You can call yourself whatever you want. I still want you to come downtown and answer some questions about the murders of Jude Marstens and Angus Stratham. Angus is dead? We can do this the easy way. You can come with me now. Or, I can go about getting a warrant. It's your choice. She's telling the truth. She doesn't know. I can deal with it myself. You're making a grave mistake. Remove your hand. Or what? Henry! It's just questions. I've been on the wrong side of his questions before. Let's go. She's innocent. I can sense it. That's not good enough any more. She's going to have to prove it. Fine. That was wonderful. That's not what Franklin would have said. Who's Franklin? Edward Franklin. He was a local painter. He's a bit of a muse, actually. His take was that food is necessary, but a distraction. I've never heard of him. No one has. He died penniless and alone... and unknown. I got some of his stuff from a yard sale his relatives had. Aren't muses supposed to inspire? Oh, he does. He sacrificed everything, his land, his family, eventually his life, everything, to pursue his dream. It's all in his artist's manifesto, "True creativity cannot exist without sacrifice." I'd love to see his work. Is that it? Huh! Wait! It's a really fragile piece. I'd like to keep it covered a bit longer. But, um...I could show it to you next time you come over. There are other ways to ensure a second date, you know. Cheers. Thanks. There were two bodies dumped here. There has to be some evidence. Henry, that is evidence. Put it down! This is no time for humour. What is it with this girl? What is so special? Is she that tasty? It's not like that. I knew Maya's mother. I cared for her. I cared for Maya. What, you guys were like a little family? Perhaps the closest thing I've known to one. But when I revealed my true nature to her mother, she panicked. She thought I might hurt her, hurt Maya. Oh. I could never. That explains the demon-off tattoos. She couldn't get past believing that I was evil. She did everything she could think of to make sure I didn't come back into their lives. And you didn't see Maya again until now. Maya was an amazing child. She had such a special energy, so pure, so alive. Things change. People get broken. She's the same person I knew. She just needs a little help. It wasn't your fault, Henry. Sometimes people can't be fixed. There's got to be something here. Both bodies were dumped here. The location has to be significant Here it is, 596 Hammond. It's at the end of a dead end street currently run by a development company, Chartwood Properties. They've had it for about ten years. What about before that? Okay, that's weird. Hm? What's weird? The property is owned by an Edward Franklin. Tyrone talked about a painter by that name all night. He said Edwa Franklin was his muse. That's a coincidence. I don't believe in coincidences. All right, let's try this one more time... the last time you saw Angus Stratham? Do you paint, detective? No, no I don't. I just arrest people who avoid answering questions. That's what I do. Well, I don't know who killed Angus. And I don't know who killed Jude. I see. You have a lot of anger towards men, don't you, Maya? I love men. No... you have sex with men. And it doesn't take a lot of analysis to see in your paintings that you have some issues. If I want to kill someone, I'll do it with the brush. We all have our own ways of coping, detective. What's yours? I found Edward Franklin. Want to hear his obituary? And I quote, "Edward Franklin died September 2, 1992. Survived by niece, Rachel Franklin-Philips." End quote. That's it? That's kind of sad. Yeah. I spoke to the niece. She said he was weird, and just got weirder as he got older. He ended up hanging himself. Tyrone said he had some kind of manifesto? Mm-hum. Yeah, she sent it over. Listen to this, "Art without passion is nothing more than noise for the eyes. If your hand does not serve art, cut it off. The flesh must be subject to the idea..." blah, blah. Seventy pages of hard-core wack job. All that verbiage and he leaves behind a blank canvas as a suicide note. It's weird. I mean there's so little out there, yet Tyrone talks about Franklin like he's known him his whole life. Yeah, and he couldn't have been more than a kid when he killed himself. What, did he have his journal or something? I know he has one of Franklin's paintings. No, that's impossible. The niece said he destroyed all of them. The only thing he left behind was a blank canvas. Maybe he left this one behind before he died. Okay, this is going to sound weird. Great! Tyrone said that Franklin was obsessed, right? Sacrificed himself for his art. I've been thinking, we're looking at two murders where both of the victims were snatched without anyone seeing anything, right? And then both of the bodies turn up and they've some how got paint injected directly into their lungs. And there's no way of telling how they did it. And then to top it off, the bodies are discovered posed in a vacant lot previously owned by our obsessed painter. When you put it that way, it does sound a bit fishy. What if his sacrifice didn't go unnoticed. What if he has something to do with this? What, like his ghost? Yeah, well maybe. I mean, all that passion, all that obsession and madness, what if it somehow had got him stuck here? You know, he transferred it into that blank canvas. That would mean that Tyrone is... No, Coreen! He could be in danger. Look, if Tyrone has that canvas and he hasn't been harmed, you gotta ask yourself why. He's not a bad guy. I'm not saying he's a bad guy. Wouldn't you like to find out for sure? It's open. Coreen! Hi. I thought you might like some lunch. Did I catch you at a bad time? I'm in the middle of a session. Aw, I've broken your concentration, haven't I? That's okay. Well, lunch is served. Let's get some plates. Sure. Please don't be blank. Did you hear something? Uh...no, nothing! Something fell. You know what? Sometimes my enthusiasm gets the better of me. I just noticed the time and if I don't get back to the office in fifteen minutes, I am dead. Uh...what about lunch? Rain check, okay? Sure. I told you she couldn't be trusted. I warned you about succumbing to distraction. I sacrificed everything for my art. What are you willing to sacrifice? Everything. "I want to take you into a land, into a grand... Please, come take my hand into this land, into this high... I will show you the way, I'll make you stay, I'll eat you alive." Okay, so now we know Tyrone's definitely innocent.Right? Definitely? Maybe. You saw the painting. You said it was just a bad still life. It was real gas station art gallery stuff. What, are you a qualified art critic now? Or is it a rule to dump on the whole creative community? Hey, listen.I'm trying to prove your little girlfriend'sinnocent here, okay? You know what? I think Henry and I should go talk to the niece again. Okay.What do you want me to do? Just hang tight.I'll be back in a couple hours. Okay, so we're not going to visit the niece. Why was it so important we get out of there? Well, I was looking at Franklin's manifesto while we were talking and it hit me. "The only true art is the human portrait. The face is pure reflection of the soul." Do you think the guy who wrote this ever painted a still life? I think I know why you're keeping Coreen in the dark. Her boyfriend's hiding something. You think? Anything? Tyrone's not here. Okay. Did you find anything? These all seem ralatively new. I'm not sure what a haunted canvas is supposed to look like. Better safe than sorry. Henry? What did you find? This was beside his phone. We've got to get back to the office. Coreen! I've brought you something. >>veyrone! What are you doing here? I hope you like it. Thank you. It's... You have to unwrap it, silly. Wow, it's... wonderful. Really. Oh, excuse me. Vicki Nelson... You need to learn how to appreciate art. NOPE! What are you doing? You and your friend, you threatened him. You threatened what he's trying to do! And I know it's just because you don't understand. You just have to learn to absorb the image. Let the colours wash over you. Let it sink in! Sorry Coreen! It's the only way! You are a distraction. COREEN! NO! You don't know what you've done. COREEN! Usually, I see destroying art as a crime. I think it's time to make an exception. "If it feels as though the world is standing still. It could be a dream
